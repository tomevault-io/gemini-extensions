# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to AI coding agents (Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Windsurf, Codex, Gemini, etc.) when working with code in this repository. Follows the [agents.md](https://agents.md) open standard.

## What This Project Is

Roni is an AI coaching companion for Tonal fitness machines. Users connect their Tonal account, and the AI coach reads their training history, strength scores, and workout data to program custom weekly plans. The coach pushes approved workouts directly to Tonal.

## Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js 16 (App Router), React 19, Tailwind CSS v4, shadcn/ui (Base UI)
- **Backend:** Convex (queries, mutations, actions), @convex-dev/agent for AI coach
- **Language:** TypeScript (strict mode), Zod for runtime validation
- **Testing:** Vitest, @vitest/coverage-v8
- **Formatting:** Prettier (auto-enforced via pre-commit hooks)
- **Package manager:** npm
- **Deployment:** Vercel (web), Convex (backend)

## Conductor Workspaces

This project uses [Conductor](https://conductor.build) for parallel agent development. Each workspace is an isolated git worktree with its own branch.

- **Environment files** (`.env.local`, `.env.sentry-build-plugin`) are symlinked from the repo root via the setup script -- do not copy or create them manually
- **Dev server port**: Use `$CONDUCTOR_PORT` instead of hardcoding 3000. The run script handles this automatically
- **Convex dev**: All workspaces share the same Convex dev deployment, so avoid running schema-altering backend changes in parallel. `npx convex dev` is started by the run script
- **Workspace path**: Available as `$CONDUCTOR_WORKSPACE_PATH`. The repo root is `$CONDUCTOR_ROOT_PATH`
- **Branch per workspace**: Each workspace gets a unique branch. Rename with `git branch -m new-name`

## Development Commands

```bash
# Dev servers (run concurrently in separate terminals)
npx convex dev              # Convex backend with hot reload
npm run dev                 # Next.js dev server (port 3000)

# Verification (run after every code change)
npm run typecheck           # tsc --noEmit

# Testing
npm test                    # all tests once
npx vitest --project backend   # backend tests only (convex/**/*.test.ts)
npx vitest --project frontend  # frontend tests only (src/**/*.test.{ts,tsx})
npx vitest run convex/stats.test.ts  # single test file
npm run test:watch          # watch mode
npm run test:coverage       # with coverage report

# Code quality
npm run lint                # ESLint
npm run format              # Prettier (write)
npm run format:check        # Prettier (check only)
npm run knip                # Dead code detection

# Build
npm run build               # Production build

# Convex
npx convex env set KEY value   # Set backend environment variable
npx convex deploy              # Deploy to production

# Smoke-test schema changes against the dev deployment before pushing.
# Pushes the branch's schema to dev once; fails locally if any existing row
# fails validation under the new shape. Auto-runs via the pre-push hook on
# any push that touches convex/schema.ts or convex/aiUsage.ts.
npm run convex:smoke

# Silence cron jobs on dev (optional, recommended)
npx convex env set DISABLE_CRONS true
```

## Architecture

### Core Data Flow

```
Tonal API --> [encrypted tokens] --> Convex proxy/cache layer --> Convex DB
                                                                     |
                                                                     v
User (chat) --> send message --> AI Coach Agent (Gemini, 31 tools) --> reads context
                                                                     |
                                                          creates workoutPlans (draft)
                                                                     |
                                                          user approves --> push to Tonal API
```

### Backend Domains (`convex/`)

- **`ai/`** -- Coach agent definition, 31 tools (read Tonal data, create/modify workouts, manage goals/injuries), context builder that injects training snapshot as system message, prompt construction
- **`coach/`** -- Programming engine: exercise selection, periodization (Building/Deload/Testing blocks), progressive overload tracking
- **`tonal/`** -- Tonal API integration: OAuth token management (AES-256 encrypted at rest), proxy layer with stale-while-revalidate caching, history sync, movement/workout catalog sync
- **`lib/auth.ts`** -- `getEffectiveUserId()` helper used by all user-facing queries/mutations; thin wrapper over `getAuthUserId`

### AI Observability & Evals

- **Phoenix Cloud** is the canonical AI trace destination. `convex/ai/otel.ts` registers an OpenTelemetry provider via `@arizeai/phoenix-otel` when `PHOENIX_API_KEY` is set; it falls back to a no-op provider otherwise. Both `convex/ai/otel.ts` and `convex/ai/resilience.ts` run under `"use node"` because phoenix-otel pulls `@opentelemetry/sdk-trace-node`. Do not import either module from a V8-runtime file.
- **One Phoenix trace per user turn.** `streamWithRetry` wraps each turn in `runInRunSpan`; retries + fallback share the same trace. The span's `traceId` is persisted as `aiRun.runId`, so dashboards join Convex ↔ Phoenix on that column.
- **Per-turn telemetry:** `aiRun` (one row per turn, tool sequence, token counts, finish reason, retry/fallback, outcomes) and `aiToolCalls` (per-tool args + result preview). See `convex/ai/runTelemetry.ts` for the `RunAccumulator`.
- **Eval scenarios** live in `convex/ai/evalScenarios.ts`, tagged by capability, consumed by both `convex/ai/coachEvals.test.ts` and the Phoenix scripts under `scripts/evals/phoenix/`.
- **Raw capture** (user messages, system instructions, tool args/results, assistant outputs) is intentionally on — product decision. Secrets (BYOK keys, Tonal tokens) are sanitized upstream in `convex/ai/byokErrors.ts` and `convex/chatHelpers.ts`; never weaken that guarantee.
- **PostHog keeps only product analytics.** `convex/lib/posthog.ts` no longer exports AI-generation events; don't add them back.

### Auth & Signup Policy

- Password auth via `@convex-dev/auth` with Resend OTP for password reset
- Signups are uncapped. The old 50-user beta cap and its `canSignUp`/`betaConfig` plumbing were removed when the project went open source.
- Shared-key versus BYOK enforcement is handled in `convex/byok.ts`. Users created before `BYOK_REQUIRED_AFTER` are grandfathered onto the house key; anyone created after must provide their own Google Gemini API key during onboarding.

### Tonal API Token Management

- Tokens encrypted with `TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY` (AES-256), stored in `userProfiles`
- Cron refreshes expiring tokens every 30 minutes (`tonal/tokenRefresh.ts`)
- `withTokenRetry` pattern: try with current token, on 401 refresh and retry
- `withTonalToken()` helper encapsulates token decryption and injection

### Scheduled Jobs (`crons.ts`)

- Every 30m: refresh Tonal tokens
- Every 1h: refresh active user cache (tiered by `appLastActiveAt` recency)
- Every 1h: health check
- Every 1h: activation checks
- Every 1h: sweep expired Garmin OAuth states
- Every 6h: check-in trigger evaluation (missed sessions, milestones)
- Every 6h: garbage-collect orphaned chat-image storage (`internal.fileGc.vacuumUnusedFiles`)
- Every 6h: sweep expired Garmin webhook events
- Cron `0 3 * * *`: sync movement catalog
- Cron `0 4 * * 0`: sync Tonal workout catalog
- Cron `0 2 * * *`: data retention cleanup
- All crons are disabled when `DISABLE_CRONS=true` is set (see `convex/lib/env.ts`)

### Frontend Routes (`src/app/`)

- `(app)/` -- Authenticated area: dashboard, chat, schedule, stats, progress, strength, profile, settings, activity, check-ins, exercises
- `onboarding/` -- connect/preferences flow with an optional Gemini key step when BYOK is required
- `connect-tonal/` -- Tonal OAuth connection flow
- `login/`, `reset-password/` -- Auth pages
- `workouts/`, `features/`, `faq/`, `pricing/`, `how-it-works/`, `contact/`, `privacy/`, `terms/` -- Public marketing and library routes

### Rate Limiting

Uses `@convex-dev/rate-limiter`. Key limits defined in `convex/rateLimits.ts`:

- `sendMessage` -- burst + daily cap per user

## Priority Hierarchy

When principles conflict, the higher number always wins.

1. **Correctness** -- Code must produce correct results and pass all tests. Never overridden.
2. **Security** -- Every system boundary validates auth, input, and ownership.
3. **Clarity** -- A developer unfamiliar with the codebase can read any function without external context.
4. **Simplicity** -- Write the least code that satisfies the requirement. No speculative abstractions.
5. **Decoupling** -- A change to module A should not force changes in module B.
6. **DRY** -- Each piece of knowledge exists in one place. May duplicate when the shared abstraction would couple unrelated modules.
7. **Performance** -- Optimize only measured bottlenecks. May pre-optimize when cost is zero (Map vs repeated array scan) or when O(n) vs O(n^2) at known scale.

## Decision Trees

### Should I extract a shared abstraction?

- Do I have 3+ concrete cases? No -> don't abstract. Duplication is cheaper than the wrong abstraction.
- Do all cases change for the same reason? No -> don't abstract. Incidental duplication will diverge.
- Is the abstraction simpler than the duplication? No -> don't abstract.
- Yes to all -> extract it. Minimal interface. Parameterize only what varies today.

### Should I split this function?

- Is it >60 lines? No -> probably fine. Stop unless readability is poor.
- Can I name the extracted piece with a meaningful domain name (not `doStep2`)? No -> don't split.
- Will the extracted piece have >1 caller? Yes -> split into its own exported function.
- Is it a sequential coordination function (imperative shell)? Yes -> keep together, add phase comments.
- Otherwise -> split, but keep in the same file unless independently testable.

### Should I add an interface/abstraction layer?

- Do I have 2+ implementations today? No -> is this at a system boundary (DB, external API)? No -> don't add it. Yes -> add it for testability.
- Am I adding it "for future flexibility"? -> Don't. YAGNI. Extract when the second implementation arrives.

### Should I handle this error or let it propagate?

- Is this a system boundary (API route, webhook, queue consumer)? -> Catch, return structured error, log with context.
- Can I add meaningful context the caller doesn't have? -> Catch, wrap with context, re-throw.
- Is this an expected business case (not found, validation, permissions)? -> Handle explicitly.
- Otherwise -> let it propagate. Don't catch just to log and re-throw.

### Should I add a test?

- Pure function with logic (conditionals, transforms, calculations)? -> Unit test. Happy path + at least one edge case.
- API route or Convex mutation/action? -> Test. Happy path + at least one auth/validation error case.
- Trivial getter/setter with no logic? -> Don't test.
- Wires together other tested pieces with no new logic? -> Integration test, not unit test.
- Testing framework behavior? -> Don't test. Trust the framework.

## Phase Rules

### Before Writing

- **Dependency direction:** UI -> Application -> Domain. Never reverse.
- **State shape:** Use discriminated unions, not boolean flags. Make illegal states unrepresentable.
- **Error strategy:** Decide Result types vs exceptions BEFORE writing. Don't mix within a layer.
- **API surface:** Define input types, output types, and error cases before implementing the body.

### While Writing

- Function names use a verb. If you need "and" in the name, split it.
- Max 3 positional arguments. Beyond that, use an options object.
- Return empty collections (`[]`, `{}`) instead of null for expected empty results.
- Default to `readonly`. Mutate only with measured performance reason.
- Guard clauses at the top, happy path unindented. No nested if/else pyramids.
- No magic values. Extract to named constants.
- Comments explain WHY, never WHAT. If explaining WHAT, rename instead.
- `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` blocks `any`. Avoid `as` casts except at deserialization boundaries with runtime validation (Zod). The `as` rule is a convention, not mechanically enforced.
- Exhaustive switches: use `const _exhaustive: never = value` for unhandled union members.

### After Writing

- Can I explain the function in one sentence without "and"?
- Does the abstraction have 2+ callers TODAY? If not, inline it.
- Does each test verify behavior (input -> output) or implementation details?
- Does each catch block add information, or just re-throw/swallow?
- Would a junior developer understand this without a walkthrough?
- Can I delete any code and still pass all tests? If yes, it's dead -- remove it.

## Red Flags (stop and reconsider)

- You created a utility function used by exactly one caller
- Your abstraction has more lines than the duplication it replaced
- A function has >3 levels of nesting
- A file exceeds the 400-line hard cap, or repeatedly grows past the 300-line soft cap
- A function grows past ~60 lines (convention, not mechanically enforced)
- You're mocking >2 dependencies in a single test
- A function takes >5 parameters
- You added a parameter "just in case"
- You built configuration for something with exactly one value
- You created an interface with exactly one implementation (not at a system boundary)

## File Organization

- **One component per `.tsx` file.** Named export matching the filename.
- **Max 300 lines per file as a soft cap, 400 lines as a hard cap.** If approaching the soft cap, split by responsibility.
- **Convex modules:** One concept per file in `convex/`. Queries, mutations, and actions for the same domain live together.
- **Test files:** Co-located as `<module>.test.ts` next to the source file.
- **No barrel files** (`index.ts` that re-exports). Import directly from the source module.

## Testing Rules

- Test behavior, not implementation. Test inputs and outputs, not internal wiring.
- AAA structure: Arrange, Act, Assert. Separate with blank lines.
- Name tests as sentences: "rejects appointments scheduled in the past"
- Mock at boundaries (DB, APIs, email), not internal functions.
- Every function gets at least one error/edge case test.
- Tests must be deterministic. No reliance on system time, random values, or network.
- Use test data builders for complex objects (provide defaults, allow overrides).

## Convex Patterns

- Use `query` for reads, `mutation` for DB writes, `action` for external API calls.
- Prefix functions with `internal.*` when they should not be callable from the frontend.
- All user-facing queries/mutations must call `getEffectiveUserId()` from `convex/lib/auth.ts` to resolve the authenticated user.
- `process.env` only in Convex actions or Next.js API routes. `NEXT_PUBLIC_` for client-side.
- Every new mutation/action: check if it needs rate limiting (see `convex/rateLimits.ts`).
- Validate external input with Zod at the action boundary. Internal functions receive typed data.
- The Tonal API integration uses `cachedFetch` pattern -- check cache, fetch if expired, update cache.
- **Schema narrows that could reject existing rows must use widen → migrate → narrow.** Convex validates schema against existing data on `npx convex deploy` (Vercel runs this on every merge to main). A narrowing PR that ships before its data backfill migration runs will fail the deploy and lock prod until recovered. Pattern: PR 1 ships the migration code with the validator still wide; operator runs the migration; PR 2 ships the narrow. The `npm run convex:smoke` pre-push hook catches this against the dev deployment if dev has the same data shape.

## Key Type Locations

- **Tonal API types** (TonalUser, Movement, Activity, StrengthScore, etc.): `convex/tonal/types.ts`
- **Domain types** (MuscleGroup, SessionDurationMinutes, OverloadSuggestion, etc.): `lib/volumeIntensityTypes.ts`
- **Enriched week plan** (EnrichedDay, EnrichedWeekPlan): `convex/weekPlanEnriched.ts`
- **Week plan validators/constants** (SESSION_TYPES, DAY_STATUSES, preferredSplitValidator): `convex/weekPlanHelpers.ts`
- **Convex document/ID types**: `import type { Doc, Id } from "./_generated/dataModel"`
- **Workout block structure**: `convex/validators.ts` (blockInputValidator)

## Installed UI Components (shadcn/ui)

alert, badge, button, card, dialog, input, label, skeleton, textarea

Install new ones with `npx shadcn@latest add <component>`.

## Error Handling

All errors use `throw new Error("message")` -- no custom error classes or ConvexError. Three patterns:

- **Auth/ownership guard** (top of handler): `if (!userId) throw new Error("Not authenticated")`
- **Validation** (before processing): `if (args.dayIndex < 0 || args.dayIndex > 6) throw new Error("dayIndex must be 0-6")`
- **Action return objects** (actions that callers need to distinguish success/failure): `return { error: "reason" }` or `return { weekPlanId }`

## Automated Enforcement

The following are enforced by tooling -- you don't need to remember them:

- **Formatting:** Prettier runs on pre-commit (husky + lint-staged) and `npx prettier --check .` runs in CI
- **File size:** `scripts/check-file-size.sh` runs on pre-commit via lint-staged and in CI (300-line soft cap, 400-line hard cap). Function length and complexity are conventions only -- no ESLint rule enforces them.
- **Type safety:** `npx tsc --noEmit` runs in CI
- **Linting:** `eslint --max-warnings=0` runs on pre-commit and in CI. `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` blocks `any`.
- **Dead code:** Knip runs in CI
- **Commit format:** Commitlint (`@commitlint/config-conventional`) enforces `type: description` via the `commit-msg` husky hook
- **Tests:** Vitest runs in CI with coverage thresholds from `vitest.config.ts`
- **Security:** `npm audit --audit-level=high` runs in CI
- **E2E:** Playwright smoke tests run on pull requests

<!-- convex-ai-start -->

This project uses [Convex](https://convex.dev) as its backend.

When working on Convex code, **always read
`convex/_generated/ai/guidelines.md` first** for important guidelines on
how to correctly use Convex APIs and patterns. The file contains rules that
override what you may have learned about Convex from training data.

Convex agent skills for common tasks can be installed by running
`npx convex ai-files install`.
