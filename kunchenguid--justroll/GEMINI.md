# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to agents when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

`justroll` is a macOS CLI that records every selected screen and camera to its own clean file in one command.
Each clip carries a copy of the same microphone track, so any editor's "sync by audio" lines them up without timecode gear.
It is a single-package ESM Node project (`"type": "module"`, Node >= 20) using **ink** + **React** (via `htm`, not JSX) for the terminal UI, and **ffmpeg** as the only runtime dependency.

## Commands

```sh
pnpm install               # uses pnpm (packageManager pinned); pnpm-workspace.yaml present
pnpm test                  # node --test over test/*.test.js
node --test test/plan.test.js          # run a single test file
node --test --test-name-pattern "groups all screens"   # run one test by name
pnpm run lint              # eslint src bin test scripts
pnpm run format            # prettier --write
pnpm run format:check      # prettier --check (CI uses this)
pnpm run demo              # live UI with a synthetic engine, records nothing
pnpm run selftest          # headless real-device capture that verifies the pipeline
make demo                  # regenerate demo.gif/demo.mp4 (needs vhs + ffmpeg)
```

Per Kun's global instructions: use TDD for features and bug fixes; tests live in `test/` mirroring `src/` module names.

## Architecture

The codebase is split into **pure, testable logic** (most of `src/`) and **side-effecting edges** (process spawning in `recorder.js`, device enumeration in `devices.js`, the ink UI, and `bin/justroll.js`). Almost everything that builds an ffmpeg command, a path, or a UI decision is a pure function so it can be unit-tested without a device.

### The recording pipeline (data flow)

1. **`bin/justroll.js`** — entry point. Parses argv, loads config, checks ffmpeg, enumerates devices, then renders the ink `App` (or runs `--selftest`/`--demo` headless/synthetic paths). Holds the CLI flags (`--dir`, `--no-mp4`, `--fps`, `--seconds`, `--selftest`, `--demo`).
2. **`devices.js`** — `enumerateDevices()` shells `ffmpeg -list_devices` and `parseDeviceList()` parses its stderr into `{ video:[{index,name,kind}], audio }`. `kind` is `screen` vs `camera` by name match. Indexes drift on replug, so devices are remembered by **name** and re-resolved via `resolveDeviceIndex`. **Camera/capture-card framerates** are mode-locked (a card may only do `1080p60`), so `probeVideoModes()` provokes ffmpeg's "Supported modes" listing (by requesting an impossible 1 fps) and `pickFramerate()` picks a supported rate; an empty list means the device won't open. **Never probe a screen this way** — a screen might actually start a 1 fps capture and hang.
3. **`plan.js`** — `buildPlan()` turns wizard selections + config into a fully-resolved plan: every directory, ffmpeg input index, output filename, and label decided **up front**. This is the contract every downstream piece consumes. `ensurePlanDirs()` creates `dir/{raw,exports,project}`.
4. **`naming.js`** — pure title→filesystem naming: `slugify`, `sessionDirName` (`YYYY-MM-DD_slug`), `uniqueDirName` (collision suffixing), `assignLabels` (`screen-0`, `screen-1`, `camera`/`camera-0`).
5. **`ffmpegArgs.js`** — **pure** ffmpeg argv builders, the heart of the tool. `buildJobArgs` (grouped **video-only** job), `buildAudioRecordArgs` (the mic's own isolated PCM file), `buildRecordArgs` (single source, legacy/tests), `buildAudioTapArgs` (PCM tap for the meter), `buildRemuxArgs` (MKV→MP4), and `parseProgress`/`normalizeProgress` for `-progress pipe:1`. Side-effect free — never spawns.
6. **`recorder.js`** — the only place processes are spawned. `Recorder` (an `EventEmitter`) runs the plan as **independent processes**: video-only capture jobs + the mic's own `buildAudioRecordArgs` process + a decoupled `startMicTap` for the live waveform. It polls per-file byte sizes from the filesystem + fps/drop from each progress stream, estimates each stream's start wall-clock from `-progress` (`_recordT0`) for cross-file `startOffsetMs` alignment, and tears down cleanly on `stop()` (`q` to stdin → SIGINT → SIGKILL), then remuxes video to MP4. `FfmpegEngine` is the **pluggable engine seam** (`createRecording(plan)`); `MockEngine` and a future `ObsEngine` implement the same surface.
7. **`session.js`** — writes the artifacts: `session.json` manifest (`buildSessionManifest`) and human-readable `notes.md` sync recipe (`buildNotesMarkdown`).
8. **`thumbnail.js`** — **pure** pixel→terminal rendering. `renderRgbHalfBlocks()` turns a raw RGB24 frame into half-block (`▀`) lines with 24-bit ANSI color (top pixel = foreground, bottom = background, doubling vertical resolution); `syntheticThumbnail()` fakes one for `--demo`. Paired with `buildScreenThumbnailArgs` (ffmpegArgs) + `grabScreenThumbnail` (recorder) to show **per-device previews of both the cameras and screens steps**, so identical monitors (or an ambiguous capture card) are told apart by their actual content, not a useless "Capture screen N" label. Camera grabs use the device's probed framerate.

### The macOS screen-capture invariant (critical, do not break)

macOS **hangs** if two avfoundation screen-capture _processes_ run at once. So `buildJobs()` (in `recorder.js`) groups **all** avfoundation screens into a **single** video-only ffmpeg process with one mapped output per screen, while each camera (and each synthetic source) gets its own process so a dead capture-card can't stall the screens. `buildJobArgs` emits one input per video, then a `-map ${i}:v` output block per source — **never any audio**. Any change to grouping must preserve this.

### Other invariants worth knowing

- **Separate clean processes — the audio model (do not collapse):** every video is captured **video-only**; the mic records in its **own isolated process** (`buildAudioRecordArgs` → `raw/audio.wav`, lossless PCM). This is deliberate and hard-won: muxing the mic into a video process made one ffmpeg simultaneously hardware-encode, capture a second device's (drifting) clock, and feed the TUI — which produced dropped-sample **static** and **A/V drift**. Do **not** reintroduce muxing audio into a video file, and do **not** tee the meter out of a kept recording (pipe back-pressure from the TUI stalls the whole process). The live waveform comes from a **separate decoupled tap** (`startMicTap`) whose hiccups can't touch a recording. `-thread_queue_size 1024` on every live input.
- **Duration alignment, not muxed audio:** every process gets `q` at the same instant, so content **ends** are synchronized and a shorter file just **started later** (device warmup). `stop()` ffprobes each output's real duration (`_probeDurationSec` — more accurate than progress `out_time`, which mis-times audio) and end-aligns: `startOffsetMs = maxDur - dur` (ms after the earliest clip), on every result + in `session.json`/`notes.md`. The mic's warmup-shortened front is then padded with silence (`_padAudioFront`, an `adelay` re-mux) so `audio.wav` drops in at 0 with no nudging; `paddedMs` records how much. Do **not** revive the old `now - out_time` timestamp estimate — avfoundation audio PTS includes a warmup gap the WAV drops, so it mis-aligned.
- **macOS input volume:** ffmpeg's avfoundation capture ignores the Sound-settings input-volume slider, so we read it (`macInputVolume` via osascript) and apply it as `-af volume=` in `buildAudioRecordArgs`. It only applies when the selected mic is the **default input** (`defaultInputName` via system_profiler — the slider only controls that device); `resolveMicGain` handles the matching and the `config.audioGain` override. Resolved on the review step in `App` and passed as `mic.gain → plan.audio.gain`.
- **Crash-safe video:** video captures to MKV (survives an abrupt kill) and remuxes to MP4 with **lossless `-c:v copy`** (audio re-encode in `buildRemuxArgs` is a no-op now that video files have no audio). The audio file is PCM WAV, finalized on the clean `q` stop. Remux is toggleable via the review screen / `--no-mp4`.
- **Camera framerate + pixel format:** capture cards are mode-locked (e.g. 1080p60) — `probeVideoModes`/`pickFramerate` (`devices.js`) pick a supported rate per camera (`s.fps`, applied in `App.startRecording`); screens use the global `settings.fps`. Screens **and** capture cards reject ffmpeg's default `yuv420p`, so recording (`buildJobArgs`) and the thumbnail grab (`buildScreenThumbnailArgs`) force `-pixel_format nv12` before `-i`.
- **Progress on stdout, stop on stdin:** ffmpeg gets `-progress pipe:1` so stdin stays free for the clean `q` quit.
- **Synthetic fallback:** when no screens are exposed (display asleep/locked or permission off), `--selftest` substitutes a `lavfi testsrc` source so the full orchestration still gets exercised. The `inputFormat`/`inputSpec` fields on a source switch a builder from avfoundation to a generic input.
- **Sequential thumbnail grabs:** the wizard's screen previews (`grabScreenThumbnail`) MUST be grabbed one at a time — this is the same no-two-concurrent-screen-captures invariant as recording. The `App` effect awaits each grab in a `for` loop; never `Promise.all` them. Previews need a 24-bit-color terminal (`getColorDepth() >= 24`) and fall back to plain text labels otherwise.

### UI (`src/ui/`)

ink + React written with `htm` template literals (`html\`...\``) — there is **no JSX/build step**, `h.js`exports`html`and`React`. `App.js`is a state machine:`phase` (`wizard|recording|stopping|done|error`) × `step`(0 mic, 1 cameras, 2 screens, 3 review). Keyboard via`useInput`. `Waveform.js`renders the live mic meter (a`RingBuffer`of levels from`audioMeter.js`). `mockEngine.js`/`mockDevices.js`drive`--demo`and UI tests without ffmpeg.`health.js` produces the inline readiness warnings (low disk, unwritable dir, no mic) shown in the wizard — there is deliberately no separate "doctor" command.

### Config & telemetry

- **`config.js`** — `~/.config/justroll/config.json` shallow-merged over `DEFAULT_CONFIG` (`mergeConfig` merges nested objects one level deep). `expandHome` handles `~`. CLI flags override config in `bin/justroll.js`'s `applyOverrides`.
- **`telemetry.js`** — anonymous counts only (screens/cameras/fps/duration), POSTed to a self-hosted Umami. **Never** sends titles, device names, or paths. Opt out with `JUSTROLL_TELEMETRY=0`. `telemetry-defaults.js` holds build-time host/website-id defaults.

## Conventions

- ESM only, Node built-ins via `node:` prefix. Comments explain _why_ (especially the platform quirks) — keep that style.
- Releases are automated by **release-please**; do not hand-edit `CHANGELOG.md` or version fields.
- PR workflows ignore release-please outputs via `paths-ignore` so release PRs create zero runs; keep that set complete with `scripts/check-release-ci-exclusions.sh` (wired early in `ci.yml`).
- Prettier + eslint are enforced in CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`); `format:check` must pass.
