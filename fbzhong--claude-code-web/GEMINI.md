## Testing Strategy

- Unit test coverage > 80%
- Integration tests cover all APIs
- End-to-end tests cover critical user flows
- Automatically run regression tests on each commit

## Configuration Management

System configuration is managed through the dynamic configuration management system, supporting runtime updates without service restart.

### Dynamic Configuration Management

Use configuration management command line tool to manage runtime configuration:

```bash
# View all configurations
npm run config:list

# View detailed configuration (including descriptions)
npm run config:list -- -v

# Get specific configuration
npm run config:get max_output_buffer

# Set configuration value
npm run config:set max_output_buffer 10000
npm run config:set require_invite_code true -- -r "Enable invite-only registration"

# Reset to default value
npm run config:reset max_output_buffer

# View configuration change history
npm run config:history
npm run config:history max_output_buffer

# Export/import configuration
npm run config:export > config.json
npm run config:import config.json
```

### Configurable Items

| Config Key | Type | Default | Description |
|------------|------|---------|-------------|
| max_output_buffer | number | 5000 | Maximum output chunks saved per session |
| max_output_buffer_mb | number | 5 | Maximum buffer size per session (MB) |
| reconnect_history_size | number | 500 | Number of history chunks sent on reconnection |
| session_timeout_hours | number | 24 | Session cleanup timeout (hours) |
| cleanup_interval_minutes | number | 60 | Cleanup task run interval (minutes) |
| container_memory_limit | string | 2g | Container memory limit |
| container_cpu_limit | number | 2 | Container CPU limit |
| require_invite_code | boolean | true | Whether invite code is required for registration |
| websocket_ping_interval | number | 30 | WebSocket ping interval (seconds) |
| websocket_ping_timeout | number | 60 | WebSocket ping timeout (seconds) |
| container_mode | boolean | true | Whether to enable container isolation mode |
| github_client_id | string | - | GitHub OAuth app Client ID |
| github_client_secret | string | - | GitHub OAuth app Client Secret |
| github_oauth_callback_url | string | - | GitHub OAuth callback URL |
| tunnels_enabled | boolean | false | Whether to enable tunnel feature |
| inlets_server_url | string | - | Inlets server WebSocket URL |
| inlets_status_api_url | string | - | Inlets server status API endpoint |
| inlets_shared_token | string | - | Shared auth token for all containers |
| tunnel_base_domain | string | - | Base domain for tunnel hostnames |

### Configuration Priority

For database-managed configuration items (set via config:set):
1. Database configuration value
2. Default value

For unmanaged configuration items:
1. Environment variable
2. Default value

Note: Once a configuration item is stored in the database, the corresponding environment variable will be ignored, ensuring configuration management consistency.

### Performance Optimization Notes

- **Dynamic updates**: Configuration changes take effect immediately without service restart
- **Caching mechanism**: Configuration cached in memory, reducing database queries
