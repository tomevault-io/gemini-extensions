Notes for Claude Code (and future contributors) working in this repo.
High-level architecture first, then the tricky bits that are easy to get
wrong.

## What this is

Clicky Windows is an Electron + TypeScript port of
[farzaa/clicky](https://github.com/farzaa/clicky). It's a tray-resident AI
screen companion: the user speaks or types, Clicky captures a screenshot,
sends it to a vision LLM, and **points at UI elements with an animated
cursor overlay** based on POINT tags the model emits inline in its reply.

See `README.md` for user-facing docs and `docs/` for feature docs.

### End-to-end query flow (what happens when the user asks something)

1. `renderer/chat` sends either a typed question via `chat:query` IPC, or
   after push-to-talk captures and decodes the mic blob to 16-bit PCM and
   sends it via `audio:recording-complete`.
2. `main/audio.ts` routes PCM to the configured transcription provider
   (`whisper-local` locally via whisper.cpp, or `openai` via the Whisper
   API). The transcript is passed to `CompanionManager.processQuery`.
3. `main/companion.ts` captures all screens (`ScreenCapture.captureAllScreens`),
   picks the current `AIProvider` (Claude / OpenAI / OpenRouter) and calls
   `query()` with the transcript, screenshots, cursor position, and trimmed
   conversation history.
4. The LLM responds with free-form text containing inline POINT tags in the
   format `[POINT:x,y:label:screenN]`.
5. `companion.ts` parses the raw tags, runs a **second-pass refinement**
   (see below), scales the resulting image-space coordinates to display
   pixels, and pushes them to the overlay via `overlay:point` IPC.
6. In parallel, the response text (with POINT tags stripped) is sent to the
   TTS provider and the raw text is returned to the chat window.

## Pointing pipeline — three coordinate spaces

**This is the easiest part of the codebase to break.** There are three
coordinate spaces in play and every transformation must be explicit:

1. **imageDimensions** — pixel space of the downsampled JPEG sent to the
   model in pass 1. Capped at `MAX_DIMENSION = 1568` because going higher
   triggers Anthropic's API-side downscaling, which silently invalidates
   model-emitted coordinates.
2. **native crop pixels** — pixel space of a high-DPI crop made from the
   original full-resolution `_source` NativeImage and sent to the model in
   pass 2 (refinement). This has a different ratio than imageDimensions.
3. **display pixels** — CSS coordinates for the overlay window, which is
   sized to `display.bounds.{width,height}`.

### Pass 1 → pass 2 refinement

A single LLM call gives roughly-right coordinates (±30 px on a 1568-wide
image is typical). On dense UI with adjacent similar elements (like/dislike,
tabs, toolbar buttons) that's not enough. The second pass:

1. For each POINT tag from pass 1, `cropScreenshotRegion` crops a ~300 px
   window (imageDimensions space) around the estimate. Internally it crops
   from the **full-resolution `_source` NativeImage**, not from the
   downsampled JPEG, so the model sees a genuinely higher-DPI patch.
2. `ClaudeService.refinePoint` sends this crop with a minimal, strict
   system prompt ("return only `x,y`, ignore visually similar neighbors")
   and `max_tokens: 32`.
3. Refined coords come back in native-crop pixels and must be translated:
   `imageX = origin.x + refined.x / pxPerImageDim`, then scaled to display
   pixels via `bounds.width / imageDimensions.width`.
4. All refinement calls run in `Promise.all`, so latency ≈ one extra API
   round-trip regardless of how many POINT tags the first pass emitted.

### Coordinate-space footguns

- **Never** send a pass-1 image larger than `MAX_DIMENSION`. Anthropic will
  downsample it server-side and the coords you get back will be in some
  third space you can't predict.
- **Never** scale coordinates before the refinement pass — refinement
  operates on raw image-space coordinates from the model.
- `_source` on `ScreenshotResult` is an Electron `NativeImage`. **Do not
  send it over IPC** to the renderer; it won't serialize correctly.
- POINT tags must be stripped from the spoken text before TTS, otherwise
  the TTS provider will read coordinates out loud. The regex lives in
  `companion.ts`.

## Overlay window

The overlay is a transparent, click-through, always-on-top BrowserWindow
sized to the primary display. Windows is finicky about this combination —
notable constraints encoded in `createOverlayWindow`:

- Use explicit `display.bounds` instead of `fullscreen: true`. The combo of
  `transparent: true` + `fullscreen: true` frequently renders nothing on
  Windows.
- Call `setIgnoreMouseEvents(true, { forward: true })` so mouse events pass
  through to whatever is underneath while the window still receives them
  for forwarding.
- Reapply `setAlwaysOnTop(true, "screen-saver")` **after** `showInactive()`
  — Windows sometimes drops the flag at show time.
- Keep the `did-finish-load` fallback `showInactive()`; on rare occasions
  `ready-to-show` never fires for transparent windows.

## Dev workflow

```sh
npm install            # once
npx tsc                # compile TS → dist/ — REQUIRED before first run and
                       # after every source change
npm run dev            # launch electron-forge
```

The `dev` script does **not** run `tsc` for you. A common mistake is
editing a `.ts` file and running `npm run dev` immediately — Electron will
load the previously-compiled `dist/main/index.js` and your change will
seem to have no effect. Either re-run `tsc` manually or run
`npx tsc --watch` in a second terminal.

Overlay debugging:
- In dev, overlay DevTools auto-open detached on load.
- Overlay renderer `console.*` messages are forwarded to the main process
  console via a `console-message` listener, so you can see them in the
  terminal you launched `npm run dev` from.
- A transparent window that renders nothing looks identical to a window
  that failed to open. Check the terminal for `[Clicky] Overlay window
  shown:` logs and the overlay DevTools for layout issues.

## External binaries (local Whisper)

`WhisperLocalProvider` expects `whisper.cpp` binaries and a GGML model at:

```
bin/Release/whisper-cli.exe (+ whisper.dll, ggml*.dll)
models/ggml-base.bin
```

Both are gitignored and must be downloaded separately. See
`docs/voice-and-tts.md` for the download and install steps. The model
filename is currently hard-coded to `ggml-base.bin` in
`src/services/transcription/whisper-local.ts`.

## Security notes

- API keys (Anthropic, OpenAI, ElevenLabs, AssemblyAI) live in
  `%APPDATA%/clicky-windows/settings.json` in plain text. Acceptable for a
  local personal tool; not appropriate for distributed binaries without
  encryption.
- `whisper-local` + local TTS + optional proxy means no audio or response
  text ever leaves the machine (see `docs/hipaa-mode.md`).
- See `SECURITY.md` for the project's disclosure policy.
