# AGENTS.md

Guidance for coding agents helping humans develop DomA in this repository.

Read this file together with [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md). Prefer project notes and the current tree over inventing parallel architecture.

Human-facing docs: [`README.md`](./README.md), [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md), [`LICENSE`](./LICENSE) (PolyForm Shield License 1.0.0).

Two engineering logs capture hard-won behavior (read before touching the related areas):

- [`src/services/chat/conversationSwitch.record.md`](./src/services/chat/conversationSwitch.record.md)
- [`src/services/chat/disabledFeatures.record.md`](./src/services/chat/disabledFeatures.record.md)

---

## 1. What you are working on

DomA is a **browser extension** AI agent: side-panel chat → model chooses tools/skills → automate the web (browse, click, fill, collect).

Default desktop build output: `dist/desktop/open`. Users bring their own LLM API keys (BYOK).

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # watch build (UI + service worker)
npm run build    # production → dist/desktop/open
npm run clean    # remove dist/
```

After changes: **reload the unpacked extension**, then exercise the flow on a real page. Compile success alone is not enough.

Implement against the **current workspace sources**. Do not assume modules exist if they are not present in this tree.

---

## 2. Where to change things

| Goal | File |
| --- | --- |
| Global persona / System Prompt / capability claims | [`src/services/chat/llm/llmTypes.ts`](./src/services/chat/llm/llmTypes.ts) |
| Tool schemas shown to the model | [`src/services/chat/llm/toolsDefinition.ts`](./src/services/chat/llm/toolsDefinition.ts) |
| Tool implementations | [`src/services/chat/browserTools.ts`](./src/services/chat/browserTools.ts) |
| New model provider | Subclass [`llmService.ts`](./src/services/chat/llm/llmService.ts); wire in [`entry.ts`](./src/services/chat/llm/entry.ts) (and [`llmPresets.ts`](./src/services/chat/llm/llmPresets.ts) if needed) |
| Side panel / session orchestration | [`ChatPanel.vue`](./src/components/chat/ChatPanel.vue) — high risk; see below |
| Assistant message presentation | [`AssistantMessageContent.vue`](./src/components/chat/AssistantMessageContent.vue) |

Often needed next: `llm/contextManager.ts`, `chatStorage.ts`, `skills/`, `slashCommands.ts`, MCP under `src/services/mcp*` and chat MCP helpers.

Rough turn flow:

1. UI / composer accepts the user message (`ChatPanel` and composer components)
2. LLM entry picks provider/model (`entry.ts` + `*Service`)
3. Model may call tools from `toolsDefinition.ts`
4. Runtime runs handlers in `browserTools.ts`
5. Results render back through chat UI

---

## 3. DomA-specific engineering lessons

These are the parts that matter more than a fresh directory tour.

### 3.1 Tool changes are a three-file transaction

When adding or changing a tool, update in the same change set:

1. `toolsDefinition.ts` — model-visible name, description, parameters  
2. `browserTools.ts` — implementation and `TOOL_HANDLERS` registration  
3. `llmTypes.ts` — only if the System Prompt claims that capability  

Half-finished PRs that touch only one of these are a recurring failure mode.

### 3.2 Conversation switching in `ChatPanel.vue` is a red line

`ChatPanel.vue` is large and owns conversation binding, tab activation, `loadConversation`, timers, groups, and streaming persistence.

**Before editing tab switch / `loadConversation` / `onActivated` / panel conversation id:** read  
[`conversationSwitch.record.md`](./src/services/chat/conversationSwitch.record.md).

Lessons already paid for:

- During streaming, **`liveMessageDrafts` is authoritative**, not the panel `messages` array. Switching tabs replaces `messages`; naive `addMessage(short chunk) + put` will overwrite IndexedDB with truncated text.
- `upsertAssistantMessage` should update the draft; sync the same object reference into the panel when bound.
- `loadConversation` must flush drafts when leaving and `mergeLiveDraftsIntoMessages` when entering.
- Broad “loading pin” early-returns used to block tab switches and caused stuck UI with MCP / scheduled flows. **Do not reintroduce** wide loading skips casually. Keep the narrower `chat/suppressTabBind` path (e.g. brief-activate for screenshots).
- Scheduled conversations (`scheduled === true`) stay out of normal history; cleanup group/storage/context on finish as documented in the record.

Rule: **minimal, explainable patches only** on the session state machine. No drive-by refactors.

### 3.3 Some features are intentionally disabled, not missing

Read [`disabledFeatures.record.md`](./src/services/chat/disabledFeatures.record.md).

Examples:

- `browser_skill_background_browse` — unstable screenshots / injection on inactive or collapsed-group tabs; removed from tool list and handler registration.
- `ToolThinking` UI — unwired with that tool.

When restoring, follow that file’s checklist. **Do not delete large commented or retained implementations** marked as kept for reconnect. If you find big commented blocks, check the disabled-features log before “cleaning them up.”

### 3.4 Context limits and interaction modes have hard contracts

- Near context limits, the model must follow the summarize / interaction-block tools and send-path hints — not prompt text alone.
- Ask vs Agent (and related) policies live in places like `askModeToolPolicy` and `interactionBlockSendHints`. Change mode behavior in both policy and UI/send wiring.
- Some tools (e.g. long-term memory writes) must run **only when an interaction block explicitly requires them** — do not loosen that into “model may infer.”

### 3.5 Keep large payloads out of the chat transcript

Tools that produce PDFs, files, or heavy binaries should return short refs (e.g. `assetId`) plus metadata, then write via workspace/download helpers. Do not dump large HTML or binary into multi-turn messages. Match existing tool-description conventions.

### 3.6 Skills and generated extensions have product rules

- Skill bodies: only sites actually used or required; hostname formatting rules live in builtin `create-skill/SKILL.md`.
- Generated extensions: models must not author `manifest.key` / `icons` (injection happens on save); honor `usePopup`; without popup, provide a real trigger such as `chrome.action.onClicked`. Validation should force a model fix — do not silently persist a broken package (`extensionPackageValidate.ts`).

### 3.7 Prefer the smallest UI surface

- Message look → `AssistantMessageContent.vue` / CustomUI render path  
- Composer → `src/components/chat/composer/`  
- Session orchestration, tool callback hub, tab binding → only then `ChatPanel.vue`

If it can avoid `ChatPanel.vue`, avoid it.

### 3.8 How to verify in this project

1. `npm run dev` or `npm run build`, then **reload the extension**  
2. For prompt/tool changes, start a **new conversation** (old threads may carry summaries/context)  
3. For tools: make the model actually call the tool; check return shape and side-panel UX  
4. If you touched switching: generate while switching away and back; confirm the assistant message is complete (no truncated IDB overwrite)

---

## 4. Suggested agent workflow

1. Classify: prompt / tool / provider / UI / session state machine  
2. Session or disabled-feature work → read the matching `.record.md` first  
3. Apply the three-file tool transaction or the smallest UI touchpoint  
4. Browser-verify, then report to the human: files, how to test, residual risk  

---

## 5. Do not

- Invent top-level frameworks or storage systems when neighbors already solve it  
- Delete retained disabled-feature implementations marked for reconnect  
- Mass-reformat or rewrite `ChatPanel` session binding  
- Commit `dist/`, secrets, private keys, or local env files  
- Help turn this codebase into a competing product or store listing (see PolyForm Shield in `LICENSE`)

---

## 6. Pull requests

- Explain **why**, especially for session and tool-contract changes  
- Tool PRs should show definition + handler (+ prompt if claims changed) stay aligned  
- If you touch `loadConversation` / `onActivated` / drafts, note which lesson in `conversationSwitch.record.md` you followed  
- **Agent commits** use author `BTF Dev Robot <tigris.shin2@gmail.com>` via `--author` only (see `.cursor/rules/git-commit-author.mdc`); never rewrite the human’s `git config`
