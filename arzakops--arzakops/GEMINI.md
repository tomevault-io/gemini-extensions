## Repository Overview

**Project Name:** ArzakOps
**Purpose:** [To be defined as project develops]
**Tech Stack:** [To be defined based on initial implementation]

### Project Goals
- Maintain high code quality and maintainability
- Follow consistent coding conventions
- Ensure comprehensive testing coverage
- Document all major components and workflows

---

## Codebase Structure

The repository structure will follow a modular organization pattern:

```
ArzakOps/
├── src/                    # Source code
│   ├── components/        # Reusable components
│   ├── services/          # Business logic and services
│   ├── utils/             # Utility functions
│   ├── config/            # Configuration files
│   └── types/             # Type definitions
├── tests/                 # Test files
├── docs/                  # Documentation
├── scripts/               # Build and utility scripts
└── CLAUDE.md             # This file
```

**Note:** This structure will be updated as the project evolves.

---

## Development Workflows

### Branch Strategy

- **Main Branch:** `main` or `master` - Production-ready code
- **Feature Branches:** `claude/feature-description-sessionid` - For new features
- **Bug Fix Branches:** `claude/fix-description-sessionid` - For bug fixes
- **Development Branch:** Branch names must start with `claude/` and end with session ID

### Development Process

1. **Always work on feature branches** - Never commit directly to main
2. **Branch naming:** Use descriptive names that indicate the purpose
3. **Commit frequently** with clear, descriptive messages
4. **Push changes** when a logical unit of work is complete
5. **Create pull requests** for code review before merging

---

## Key Conventions for AI Assistants

### General Principles

1. **Read Before Writing**
   - ALWAYS read existing files before modifying them
   - Understand the current implementation before suggesting changes
   - Never propose changes to code you haven't examined

2. **Minimal Changes**
   - Only modify what's necessary to fulfill the request
   - Avoid refactoring unless explicitly asked
   - Don't add features beyond what's requested
   - Keep solutions simple and focused

3. **Code Quality**
   - Follow existing code style and patterns
   - Maintain consistency with the current codebase
   - Write clean, readable, self-documenting code
   - Add comments only where logic isn't self-evident

4. **Security Awareness**
   - Never introduce security vulnerabilities
   - Watch for: command injection, XSS, SQL injection, path traversal
   - Validate input at system boundaries
   - Don't over-engineer error handling for internal code

5. **Backwards Compatibility**
   - Avoid compatibility hacks unless necessary
   - If code is unused, delete it completely
   - Don't rename variables to `_var` or add `// removed` comments
   - Clean removal is better than deprecated code

### File Operations

1. **Prefer Editing Over Creating**
   - ALWAYS prefer editing existing files
   - Only create new files when absolutely necessary
   - Don't create documentation files unless explicitly requested

2. **Use Appropriate Tools**
   - Use `Read` for reading files, not `cat`
   - Use `Edit` for modifications, not `sed/awk`
   - Use `Write` only for new files
   - Use `Grep` for searching, not bash grep

3. **Code References**
   - When referencing code, use format: `file_path:line_number`
   - Example: "The error handler is in src/services/api.ts:142"

### Communication Style

1. **Concise and Direct**
   - Keep responses short and focused
   - Avoid unnecessary explanations
   - Don't use emojis unless requested
   - Output text directly, not through bash echo

2. **Professional Tone**
   - Focus on technical accuracy
   - Provide objective guidance
   - Respectfully correct when necessary
   - Avoid excessive praise or validation

### Task Management

1. **Use TodoWrite for Complex Tasks**
   - Break down multi-step tasks
   - Track progress transparently
   - Mark tasks complete immediately when done
   - Keep ONE task in_progress at a time

2. **When to Use Todos**
   - Complex multi-step tasks (3+ steps)
   - Non-trivial implementations
   - User provides multiple tasks
   - After receiving new instructions

3. **When NOT to Use Todos**
   - Single straightforward tasks
   - Trivial operations
   - Simple file reads
   - Purely informational requests

---

## Code Quality Standards

### Code Style

- **Consistency:** Match existing code style in the file/module
- **Naming:** Use descriptive, self-explanatory names
- **Functions:** Keep functions focused on a single responsibility
- **Comments:** Only add where logic isn't obvious
- **Formatting:** Follow language-specific conventions

### Error Handling

- **Validate at boundaries:** User input, external APIs, file I/O
- **Trust internal code:** Don't validate what frameworks guarantee
- **Don't catch what you can't handle:** Let errors bubble up appropriately
- **Provide context:** Include relevant information in error messages

### Performance

- **Don't optimize prematurely:** Focus on clarity first
- **Avoid unnecessary abstractions:** Three similar lines > premature abstraction
- **One-time operations:** Don't create utilities for single-use code
- **Design for now:** Not hypothetical future requirements

---

## Git Workflow

### Committing Changes

**Only create commits when explicitly requested by the user.**

#### Pre-Commit Checklist

1. Run `git status` to see all changes (NEVER use `-uall` flag)
2. Run `git diff` to review changes
3. Check `git log` to match commit message style
4. Stage relevant files with `git add`
5. Commit with descriptive message
6. Run `git status` after commit to verify

#### Commit Message Format

```bash
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
<type>: <brief description>

<optional detailed explanation>
EOF
)"
```

**Commit Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `refactor`: Code restructuring
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `test`: Test additions/changes
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

#### Git Safety Rules

- NEVER update git config
- NEVER run destructive commands without explicit permission
- NEVER skip hooks (--no-verify, --no-gpg-sign)
- NEVER force push to main/master
- NEVER commit files with secrets (.env, credentials.json)
- NEVER use interactive git commands (-i flag)

#### Amending Commits

Only use `git commit --amend` when ALL conditions are met:
1. User explicitly requested amend, OR pre-commit hook auto-modified files
2. HEAD commit was created in current conversation
3. Commit has NOT been pushed to remote

**CRITICAL:** If commit FAILED or was REJECTED, NEVER amend - create a NEW commit

### Pushing Changes

```bash
git push -u origin <branch-name>
```

**Important:**
- Branch must start with `claude/` and end with session ID
- Retry up to 4 times with exponential backoff (2s, 4s, 8s, 16s) on network errors
- Example: `git push -u origin claude/feature-auth-abc123`

### Pull Requests

When creating PRs:

1. Check branch status and diff from base branch
2. Review ALL commits (not just the latest)
3. Use `git log` and `git diff [base-branch]...HEAD`
4. Create PR with comprehensive summary:

```bash
gh pr create --title "PR Title" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary
- Bullet point 1
- Bullet point 2

## Test Plan
- [ ] Test case 1
- [ ] Test case 2
EOF
)"
```

## Testing Guidelines

### Testing Principles

1. **Write tests for new features** - Unless explicitly told not to
2. **Maintain existing tests** - Update tests when changing functionality
3. **Test at appropriate levels** - Unit, integration, and E2E as needed
4. **Keep tests simple** - Tests should be easy to understand and maintain

### Test Organization

```
tests/
├── unit/              # Unit tests
├── integration/       # Integration tests
└── e2e/              # End-to-end tests
```

### Test Naming

- Test files: `[module-name].test.[ext]`
- Test cases: Descriptive names that explain what's being tested
- Use clear arrange-act-assert structure

---

## Documentation Standards

### Code Documentation

1. **Self-Documenting Code First**
   - Use clear variable and function names
   - Keep functions focused and simple
   - Structure code logically

2. **Comments When Needed**
   - Explain WHY, not WHAT
   - Document complex algorithms
   - Note important constraints or assumptions
   - Reference tickets/issues for context

3. **Type Annotations**
   - Use TypeScript or equivalent for type safety
   - Document complex type structures
   - Maintain type definitions in dedicated files

### Project Documentation

- **README.md:** Project overview, setup, and usage
- **CLAUDE.md:** This file - AI assistant guide
- **API Documentation:** Document all public APIs
- **Architecture Docs:** Explain system design and decisions

### Documentation Updates

- Update documentation when changing functionality
- Keep examples current with the codebase
- Remove outdated information
- Version documentation with code
