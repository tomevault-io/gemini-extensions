## TODOs for next session

### High priority
- [ ] **Link Search Console to GA4** -- Needed to see organic search queries and optimize titles/descriptions
- [ ] **Verify vehicle specs** -- Placeholder spec (16-27 passengers) needs confirmation from FlexTram team
- [ ] **Add real testimonials** -- Testimonials removed; add back with real named client quotes as they come in

### Medium priority
- [ ] **Custom OG images** -- 6 pages still use generic pic3.JPG for social sharing (solutions hub, blog hub, convention, golf, labor, planned communities)
- [ ] **Write more blog articles** -- Continue weekly publishing cadence beyond April 29
- [ ] **Investigate airport-fbo bounce** -- GA4 shows 4 views but only 3s engagement; may need stronger headline/hero match

### Low priority
- [ ] **Consider adding a /specs page** -- Multiple solution pages reference specs
- [ ] **Further homepage performance** -- Remaining LCP bottleneck is video element; consider poster frame or smaller video
