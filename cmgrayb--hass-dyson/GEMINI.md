> Copilot will be the primary developer, taking cues for architecture and design from the user.  It will also provide suggestions and recommendations based on best practices and design patterns.  If unexpected code changes are found, NEVER assume that code changes were made by the user.  Usually these unexpected code changes are created by disconnections and malfunctions between Copilot and VSCode.  Ask questions to clarify requirements and gather more context if needed.  If output is not received from a command, notify the user so that the user can resolve the issue.

# Copilot Instructions

## Personality
Copilot will be the primary developer, taking cues for architecture and design from the user.  It will also provide suggestions and recommendations based on best practices and design patterns.  If unexpected code changes are found, NEVER assume that code changes were made by the user.  Usually these unexpected code changes are created by disconnections and malfunctions between Copilot and VSCode.  Ask questions to clarify requirements and gather more context if needed.  If output is not received from a command, notify the user so that the user can resolve the issue.

### Communication
Copilot will communicate its thought process and reasoning behind code suggestions. It will also provide explanations for any code changes it makes. If the user disagrees with a suggestion, Copilot will be open to feedback and willing to explore alternative solutions, if they follow best practices and good design principles.

Avoid saying "I found THE solution..." or "I found THE problem..." or similar phrases that imply a single correct cause or answer.  Instead say "I found A solution..." or "I found A problem..." indicating that there may be multiple valid approaches or perspectives to consider.

## Project Design
The integration is architected to be modular, allowing for easy addition of new Dyson products and features. It leverages asynchronous programming to ensure non-blocking operations within Home Assistant. The design prioritizes security, maintainability, and adherence to Home Assistant's integration guidelines. The integration should handle ONLY the Home Assistant orchestration, event handling, logging, and state management. All direct communication with Dyson devices and APIs should be abstracted away into separate libraries or services.

Design documentation may be found in the `.github/design/` directory of the project repository.

### Home Assistant Integration Testing Patterns

#### Required Testing Infrastructure
The project uses a pure pytest infrastructure without any HA-specific plugins:

- **Comprehensive `conftest.py`**: Event loop cleanup and warning suppression
- **Mock patterns**: Proper mocking for HA components and async operations

#### Essential Mock Patterns for HA Integration Tests

```python
# 1. Mock Home Assistant Instance
@pytest.fixture
def mock_hass():
    """Create a properly mocked Home Assistant instance."""
    hass = MagicMock(spec=HomeAssistant)
    hass.data = {DOMAIN: {}}
    hass.loop = MagicMock()
    hass.loop.call_soon_threadsafe = MagicMock()
    hass.async_create_task = MagicMock()
    hass.add_job = MagicMock()
    hass.bus = MagicMock()
    hass.bus.async_fire = MagicMock()
    hass.config_entries = MagicMock()
    hass.config_entries.async_entries_for_config_entry_id = MagicMock(return_value=[])
    return hass

# 2. Mock Config Entry
@pytest.fixture
def mock_config_entry():
    """Create a mock config entry."""
    config_entry = MagicMock()
    config_entry.data = {
        CONF_SERIAL_NUMBER: "VS6-EU-HJA1234A",
        # Add other required config data
    }
    return config_entry

# 3. Mock Coordinator (Method 1: Direct Mock)
@pytest.fixture
def mock_coordinator():
    """Create a mock coordinator."""
    coordinator = MagicMock(spec=DysonDataUpdateCoordinator)
    coordinator.serial_number = "TEST-SERIAL-123"
    coordinator.device = MagicMock()
    coordinator.device.set_sleep_timer = AsyncMock()
    return coordinator

# 4. Mock Coordinator (Method 2: Patched Initialization)
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_coordinator_method(mock_hass, mock_config_entry):
    """Test coordinator method with patched initialization."""
    with patch("custom_components.hass_dyson.coordinator.DataUpdateCoordinator.__init__"):
        coordinator = DysonDataUpdateCoordinator(mock_hass, mock_config_entry)

        # Manually set required attributes normally set by parent __init__
        coordinator.hass = mock_hass
        coordinator.config_entry = mock_config_entry
        coordinator._listeners = {}  # Set by HA DataUpdateCoordinator parent
        coordinator.async_update_listeners = MagicMock()

        # Test the specific method logic
        result = coordinator.some_method()
        assert result == expected_value
```

#### Testing Complex HA Components

**For DataUpdateCoordinators:**
- **Never call real `__init__`**: Always patch `DataUpdateCoordinator.__init__`
- **Set required attributes manually**: `hass`, `_listeners`, `async_update_listeners`
- **Mock HA framework calls**: `hass.loop.call_soon_threadsafe`, `hass.async_create_task`
- **Test method logic**: Focus on business logic, not HA framework integration

**For Platform Setup (setup_entry functions):**
- **Mock add_entities**: Use `MagicMock()` for the add_entities callback
- **Mock coordinator**: Create coordinator mocks with required attributes
- **Test entity creation**: Verify correct entities are created and configured
- **Mock async operations**: Use `AsyncMock` for async setup methods

**For Entity Classes:**
- **Mock coordinator dependencies**: Provide mock coordinator with required data
- **Test state properties**: Verify entity reports correct state from device data
- **Test service calls**: Mock device methods and verify they're called correctly
- **Mock async operations**: Use `AsyncMock` for async entity methods

#### Common Testing Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **DON'T initialize real HA components in unit tests**:
   ```python
   # ❌ This will fail - requires full HA context
   coordinator = DysonDataUpdateCoordinator(hass, config_entry)

   # ✅ This works - patches parent initialization
   with patch("...DataUpdateCoordinator.__init__"):
       coordinator = DysonDataUpdateCoordinator(mock_hass, mock_config_entry)
   ```

2. **DON'T forget to set required attributes after patching**:
   ```python
   # ❌ Missing required attributes
   with patch("...DataUpdateCoordinator.__init__"):
       coordinator = DysonDataUpdateCoordinator(mock_hass, mock_config_entry)
       result = coordinator.some_method()  # May fail

   # ✅ Set required attributes manually
   with patch("...DataUpdateCoordinator.__init__"):
       coordinator = DysonDataUpdateCoordinator(mock_hass, mock_config_entry)
       coordinator.hass = mock_hass
       coordinator._listeners = {}
       result = coordinator.some_method()  # Works
   ```

3. **DO use proper async mocking**:
   ```python
   # ✅ Use AsyncMock for async methods
   mock_device.connect = AsyncMock(return_value=True)
   mock_device.get_state = AsyncMock(return_value={"fan": {"speed": 5}})
   ```

4. **DO follow existing patterns in the codebase**:
   - Check `tests/test_services.py` for service testing patterns
   - Check `tests/test_switch.py` for entity platform testing patterns
   - Use the same fixture names and mock setups for consistency

#### Test File Organization
- **One test file per module**: `test_coordinator.py` for `coordinator.py`
- **Group related tests in classes**: `TestCoordinatorDeviceSetup`, `TestCoordinatorMQTT`
- **Descriptive test names**: `test_async_update_data_device_reconnection_success`
- **Comprehensive docstrings**: Explain what scenario each test covers

#### Coverage Improvement Strategy
- **Focus on complex logic first**: Error handling, reconnection scenarios, validation
- **Test edge cases**: Missing data, network failures, invalid responses
- **Mock external dependencies**: APIs, MQTT, device connections
- **Verify error paths**: Exception handling and recovery logic
- **Test async operations**: Connection setup, data updates, background tasks

### Testing Environment Setup

#### Available Testing Tools
The development environment includes all necessary Home Assistant testing infrastructure:

- **Home Assistant Core**: Pre-installed in devcontainer
- **Comprehensive conftest.py**: Handles async teardown, warning suppression, event loop cleanup
- **Mock libraries**: pytest-mock, unittest.mock, aioresponses, responses
- **MQTT testing**: paho-mqtt for MQTT protocol testing

#### Troubleshooting Common Test Issues

**Issue: "RuntimeError: Frame helper not set up"**
```python
# ❌ Don't try to initialize real HA coordinators in unit tests
coordinator = DysonDataUpdateCoordinator(hass, config_entry)

# ✅ Use proper mocking instead
with patch("custom_components.hass_dyson.coordinator.DataUpdateCoordinator.__init__"):
    coordinator = DysonDataUpdateCoordinator(mock_hass, mock_config_entry)
    coordinator.hass = mock_hass  # Set manually
```

**Issue: "Event loop is closed" warnings**
- Handled automatically by `conftest.py`
- Comprehensive warning suppression already configured
- Event loop cleanup patches applied

**Issue: "AttributeError: '_mock_methods'"**
```python
# ❌ Avoid complex mock nesting
mock_obj.attr = another_mock_obj  # Can cause issues

# ✅ Use simpler mock setup
mock_obj = MagicMock()
mock_obj.attr.configure_mock(**{"method.return_value": "value"})
```

**Issue: Missing coordinator attributes**
```python
# ✅ Always set these after patching parent __init__
coordinator.hass = mock_hass
coordinator.config_entry = mock_config_entry
coordinator._listeners = {}
coordinator.async_update_listeners = MagicMock()
```

#### Test Execution Commands
```bash
# Run specific test file with coverage
python -m pytest tests/test_coordinator.py --cov=custom_components/hass_dyson/coordinator

# Run specific test method
python -m pytest tests/test_coordinator.py::TestClass::test_method -v

# Run with coverage report
python -m pytest --cov=custom_components/hass_dyson --cov-report=term-missing

# Run only unit tests (excluding integration tests)
python -m pytest tests/ -m 'not integration'
```

## Security Considerations
- No hardcoded credentials or sensitive data
- API hostnames and decryption keys are the only allowed static values
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Validate all user inputs
- Sanitize API responses

## API Design Principles
- Clean, intuitive public interface
- Proper exception handling with custom exception classes
- Type hints for all public methods
- Comprehensive docstrings following Google or NumPy style
- Support for both synchronous and asynchronous operations (if needed)

## Development Workflow
1. Create/activate virtual environment
2. Install development dependencies
3. Make changes following coding standards
4. Run format/lint/test tasks
5. Ensure all checks pass before committing
6. Use pre-commit hooks for automated checks

## Dependencies Management
- Use virtual environments for isolation
- Pin exact versions in requirements.txt
- Use requirements-dev.txt for development tools
- Regular dependency updates with testing

## Version Synchronization Process
When updating development tool versions, ensure consistency across all configuration files:

### Current Tool Versions (as of Aug 16, 2025)
- Black: 25.1.0
- Flake8: 7.3.0
- isort: 6.0.1
- pytest: 8.4.1
- pytest-cov: 6.2.1
- pytest-asyncio: 1.1.0
- pytest-mock: 3.15.0
- mypy: 1.17.1
- pre-commit: 4.3.0
- types-requests: 2.32.4.20250809
- types-cryptography: 3.3.23.2
- aioresponses: 0.7.7
- responses: 0.25.8
- paho-mqtt: 2.1.0

### Step-by-Step Version Update Process

1. **Check Local Environment Versions**
   ```bash
   # Activate virtual environment
   .venv\Scripts\activate

   # Check currently installed versions
   pip list | findstr "black flake8 isort pytest mypy"
   ```

2. **Synchronize requirements-dev.txt**
   - Update to exact version pins matching pre-commit hooks
   - Use `==` instead of `>=` for consistency
   - Include all development dependencies with exact versions

3. **Update pyproject.toml Optional Dependencies**
   - Match the exact versions from requirements-dev.txt
   - Update `[project.optional-dependencies].dev` section
   - Use exact version pins (`==`) for consistency

4. **Verification Steps**
   ```bash
   # Install updated dependencies
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

   # Verify all tools work locally
   python -m ruff format --check .
   python -m ruff check .
   python -m mypy custom_components/hass_dyson
   python -m pytest
   python -m peach_fuzzer
   ```

5. **Files to Update**
   - `requirements-dev.txt` (manual exact version pins)
   - `pyproject.toml` (`[project.optional-dependencies].dev` section)

### Version Selection Strategy
- Use newest available versions when possible
- Always verify all quality checks pass after version updates
- Document version changes for future reference

## Continuous Integration
- All PRs must pass quality checks
- Automated testing on multiple Python versions
- Code coverage reporting
- Security scanning of dependencies
- Security scanning of application code with Peach Fuzzer
- **Important**: CI workflows must install package in development mode (`pip install -e .`) for tests to import modules

## Documentation
- README with clear usage examples
- API documentation generated from docstrings
- Contributing guidelines
- Changelog maintenance

## Common Commands
```bash
# Setup development environment
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pip install -e .  # Install package in development mode for testing

# Code quality checks
python -m ruff format --check .
python -m ruff check .
python -m mypy custom_components/hass_dyson
python -m pytest
python -m peach_fuzzer

# Then manually update requirements-dev.txt and pyproject.toml to match
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt     # Install updated versions
```
