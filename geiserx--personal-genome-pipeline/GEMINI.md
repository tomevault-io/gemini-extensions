# AGENTS.md — Personal Genome Pipeline

Instructions for AI agents working on this repository.

## Project Context

This is a public, open-source WGS (Whole Genome Sequencing) analysis pipeline designed for consumer hardware. It must be:
- **Generic**: No personal data, no hardcoded paths, no user-specific defaults
- **Reproducible**: Every command must work on any Linux amd64 machine with Docker
- **Well-documented**: Target audience includes non-bioinformaticians analyzing their own genome data

## Critical Rules

### No Personal Information
- NEVER commit personal paths (e.g., `/mnt/user/Multimedia/`, server hostnames, IP addresses)
- NEVER use specific sample names as defaults (use `your_name` or `$SAMPLE` placeholder)
- All environment variables must require user to set them: `${VAR:?Set VAR to...}`
- Docker mount point is always `:/genome` (not locale-specific)

### Script Conventions
- Shebang: `#!/usr/bin/env bash`
- Error handling: `set -euo pipefail`
- Parameters: `SAMPLE=${1:?Usage: $0 <sample_name>}`
- Environment: `GENOME_DIR=${GENOME_DIR:?Set GENOME_DIR to your data directory}`
- Docker: always use `--cpus N --memory Xg` limits, `-v "${GENOME_DIR}:/genome"` mount, `--rm` flag
- Add `--user root` when the container needs write access to bind mounts
- Validate all input files exist before running Docker commands
- Print clear status messages: step name, input files, output location

### Documentation Conventions
- Each pipeline step has a matching doc in `docs/XX-name.md` and script in `scripts/XX-name.sh`
- Docs must include: What it does, Why, Tool name, Docker image, Command, Output, Runtime estimate, Notes
- README.md step table must stay in sync with actual docs and scripts
- All Docker images must include the exact tag (not just `:latest` unless no versioned tags exist)

### Lessons Learned
- **ALWAYS update `docs/lessons-learned.md`** when encountering a new failure, workaround, or non-obvious behavior
- Include: what failed, why it failed, and the fix
- This is the most valuable document for future users — every Docker image issue, permission error, path confusion, and tool quirk should be recorded here

### Testing Changes
- After modifying any script, verify:
  1. No personal paths remain (`grep -r '/mnt/user\|watchtower\|sergio\|annais' scripts/ docs/`)
  2. All scripts use `GENOME_DIR` not `GENOMA_DIR`
  3. Docker mount is `:/genome` not `:/genoma`
  4. `shellcheck` passes on all scripts (if available)

### Git Practices
- Commit messages: descriptive, multi-line for large changes
- Never force-push to main
- Keep commits atomic: docs + scripts for the same feature in one commit

## When Adding a New Step

1. Create `docs/NN-tool-name.md` following the template of existing docs
2. Create `scripts/NN-tool-name.sh` following the script conventions above
3. Update `README.md` step table with the new step
4. Update `scripts/run-all.sh` to include the new step in the appropriate phase
5. Update `docs/00-reference-setup.md` if new reference data or Docker images are needed
6. Update `docs/interpreting-results.md` if the output needs explanation
7. Add the Docker image to the pre-pull list in `docs/00-reference-setup.md`
8. Test on at least one sample before committing

## Tool-Specific Gotchas (Learned from Real Execution)

### PharmCAT 2.15.5
- **Two-step workflow**: Preprocessor (`pharmcat_vcf_preprocessor.py` with `-refFna`) → main jar (`pharmcat.jar`). The old `-refFasta` flag on the jar no longer exists.
- Preprocessor outputs `.preprocessed.vcf.bgz` (NOT `.vcf`).
- JSON output structure: `genes` is `{source → {gene_name → data}}` (dict of dicts), NOT a list. `sourceDiplotypes` contains `allele1`/`allele2` objects with `.name` field.
- Star allele calls may differ from other pipelines (e.g., Sanitas hg19 vs our hg38 DeepVariant). PharmCAT 2.15.5 definitions update frequently.
- **Pipeline pin vs upstream**: The pipeline is currently pinned to PharmCAT `2.15.5` for reproducibility, but upstream PharmCAT releases continue to ship new guideline content and parser-relevant format changes. Before bumping the Docker tag, revalidate both step 7 and step 27 end-to-end — the JSON structure and preprocessor flags have changed between major versions.

### plink2 (PRS / Ancestry)
- **chrX requires sex info**: Use `--chr 1-22 --allow-extra-chr` for PRS/PCA (autosomal only).
- **`--output-chr chrM`** preserves `chr` prefix in output. Without it, `--chr 1-22` strips prefix → variant IDs become `1:pos` instead of `chr1:pos`.
- **`--set-all-var-ids '@:#'`**: The `@` placeholder includes the full contig name (including `chr`). Do NOT use `chr@:#` or you get `chrchr1:pos`.
- **Scoring file duplicates**: Large PGS Catalog files (e.g., PGS000014 with 7M variants) contain duplicate variant:allele pairs. Deduplicate before `--score` or plink2 errors.
- **LD pruning requires >=50 samples**. PCA requires >=2. Single-sample ancestry is fundamentally limited.
- **PRS guardrail**: Raw PRS scores are NOT percentiles, absolute risks, or portable labels across tool versions. Never describe them that way unless you have an ancestry-matched reference cohort scored with the exact same PGS file and preprocessing.
- **Ancestry guardrail**: Treat the current single-sample ancestry step as overlap/QC plus a starting point for downstream projection work, not as a population-placement tool by itself.

### Chip Data Conversion (bcftools vs plink)
- **NEVER use plink 1.9 → plink2 for single-sample chip-to-VCF conversion.** plink's `.bim` format encodes monomorphic sites with only one allele (A1=0). For single-sample data, ALL homozygous positions are monomorphic. `--ref-from-fa` cannot fix these because there's no second allele to work with. Result: all homozygous ALT genotypes silently become homozygous REF (0/0 with ALT=.). Verified empirically: rs9939609 (FTO) genotype=AA, REF=T → plink outputs `REF=A, ALT=., GT=0/0` (WRONG) instead of `REF=T, ALT=A, GT=1/1`.
- **Use `bcftools convert --tsv2vcf -f <reference.fa>`** instead. It reads the FASTA directly and correctly handles all three genotype classes (hom-ref, het, hom-alt). Typical output from 609K MyHeritage GSA chip: ~430K hom-ref, ~107K het, ~66K hom-alt.
- **MyHeritage CSV needs pre-conversion** to TSV format (strip quotes, comments, headers; rearrange columns).
- **hg19 VCF needs chr prefix** before liftover — `bcftools annotate --rename-chrs` converts numeric chromosomes (1, 2, ...) to chr-prefixed names (chr1, chr2, ...) required by the chain file.
- **Picard LiftoverVcf warns about ~900 swapped REF/ALT** variants between builds — these are not recovered by default.
- **PharmCAT on chip data**: calls many genes correctly (CYP2B6, CYP4F2, DPYD, NUDT15) but misses CYP2C19 (25 missing positions), VKORC1 (1 missing position), and miscalls CYP3A5 (4 missing positions on MyHeritage GSA).
- **ROH on chip data** requires `-G30` flag because chip VCFs lack FORMAT/PL tags.
- **PRS on chip data** requires `no-mean-imputation` flag (single sample lacks allele frequencies). Matches ~12% of large scoring files vs ~28% from WGS.

### Alternative Callers & Benchmarking (v0.2.0)
- **Output isolation**: Alternative tools write to separate directories (vcf_gatk/, vcf_freebayes/, vcf_strelka2/, aligned_bwamem2/, sv_tiddit/) to never overwrite default outputs.
- **INTERVALS env var**: GATK (`03a`) and FreeBayes (`03b`) support `INTERVALS=chr22` (or any region) for quick testing. GATK uses `--intervals`, FreeBayes uses `--region`. Strelka2 (`03c`) and TIDDIT (`04a`) do not support INTERVALS — they always process the full genome.
- **Strelka2 is a small-variant caller (SNVs + indels ≤49bp)**, not an SV caller. Script `03c-strelka2-germline.sh` outputs to `vcf_strelka2/`. It complements Manta (SVs), not replaces it. Strelka2's scoring model was trained on BWA-MEM data; minimap2 does not produce XS tags. SNP precision drops noticeably with minimap2. Use BWA-MEM2 alignments for best results.
- **FreeBayes is single-threaded**: No parallelism flag. Full WGS takes ~9 hours. Needs `--memory 32g` (peaks at ~13 GB). Use `INTERVALS` to restrict to a chromosome for testing.
- **GATK full-genome is slow**: 8.6 hours on i5-14500 with 8 threads despite good parallelism. Comparable to FreeBayes in wall-clock time.
- **GATK needs .dict file**: Unlike DeepVariant, GATK HaplotypeCaller requires `Homo_sapiens_assembly38.dict` alongside the FASTA. Generate with `gatk CreateSequenceDictionary`.
- **BWA-MEM2 index files**: Created alongside the FASTA (not in a separate directory). Check for `.bwt.2bit.64` to verify index exists.
- **ALIGN_DIR env var**: All alternative caller scripts (03a, 03b, 03c, 04a) accept `ALIGN_DIR=aligned_bwamem2` to use BWA-MEM2 alignments instead of the default `aligned/`. Example: `ALIGN_DIR=aligned_bwamem2 ./scripts/03c-strelka2-germline.sh sample`.
- **TIDDIT --skip_assembly is auto-detected**: TIDDIT's script checks for BWA index files. If present (BWA-MEM2 was used), local assembly runs automatically. If absent (minimap2), `--skip_assembly` is added.
- **benchmark-variants.sh**: Two modes — pairwise (`bcftools isec` with PASS filter + normalization) and truth set (`hap.py`). Pairwise mode auto-discovers all vcf*/ directories. Truth mode requires the query VCF to come from the same biological sample as the truth set (e.g., HG002).

### bcftools
- **`bcftools sort` requires `##contig` headers** — fails silently or errors on VCFs without them. Always inject contig headers from the reference `.fai` when building VCFs.
- **`set -euo pipefail` + `find | grep -q`**: If the directory doesn't exist, `find` exits 1, which poisons pipefail even with `2>/dev/null`. Use per-directory flag variables instead.

### VEP
- Running without `--af_gnomade` produces VCF lacking gnomAD frequencies. The clinical filter (step 23) then can't filter by population frequency, resulting in thousands of unfiltered MODERATE variants.

### Cyrius (CYP2D6)
- Returns `None/None` for both samples — common limitation of short-read WGS due to CYP2D7 homology and structural rearrangements.

## Knowledge Base / Tool Update Cadence

| Resource / Tool | Update Frequency | Re-run Steps | Time |
|---|---|---|---|
| ClinVar | Monthly full release (first Thursday) + optional weekly Monday deltas | 6 (ClinVar screen) | ~5 min |
| Ensembl / VEP cache | Each Ensembl release (~6 months; release 115 current, 116 expected Apr 2026) | 13, 23 | ~3 hr |
| PCGR/CPSR data | Annually or when upstream bundle changes materially | 17 | ~45 min |
| PharmCAT upstream release | Check quarterly; latest known upstream was 3.2.0 (2026-02-25) while pipeline stays pinned to 2.15.5 | 7, 27 | ~15-30 min validation |
| CPIC / ClinPGx guideline surface | Check quarterly and whenever a relevant drug-gene pair changes upstream | 27 | ~15 min code refresh |
| PGS Catalog | Check quarterly against the latest release page; treat scoring-file version changes as result-changing events | 25 | ~30 min |

ClinVar is the highest-value update — new pathogenic classifications happen monthly.
Before bumping PharmCAT, validate the preprocessor flags, JSON parsing in step 27, and any phenotype/diplotype changes on a known test sample.
For a public pipeline, keep PGS IDs, PharmCAT Docker tags, and the CPIC lookup table explicitly versioned in git so result changes are auditable over time.

### Minimal Revalidation Before Publishing Updates

1. **ClinVar / VEP refresh**: run step 6 and step 23 on one known sample, then compare pathogenic hit counts and filtered clinical variant counts against the previous run.
2. **PharmCAT / CPIC refresh**: run step 7 and step 27 on one known sample, then diff diplotypes, phenotypes, and recommendation text before accepting the update.
3. **PGS Catalog refresh**: rerun step 25 and compare both `variants_used/variants_total` and raw score deltas. If the scoring file version changed, treat the new output as a new baseline, not as directly comparable to the old one.
4. **Documentation refresh**: update pinned versions, cadence notes, and any changed interpretation guardrails in docs before merging.

## Common Issues When Developing

- **Docker image not found**: Biocontainer tags change frequently. Use `docker search` or check quay.io/biocontainers directly.
- **Permission denied in container**: Add `--user root`. Most bioinformatics images run as non-root.
- **0-byte output**: Usually means the input path was wrong inside the container. Double-check the `:/genome` mount mapping.
- **PCGR/CPSR path confusion**: `--pcgr_dir` should point to the PARENT of `data/`, not `data/` itself. CPSR appends `/data` internally.
- **VEP cache download**: Use `wget -c` (resume-capable), not VEP's `INSTALL.pl` which can't resume 26 GB downloads.

## Audience Reminder

Every decision should be evaluated through the lens of: "Would a non-bioinformatician who just received their WGS data be able to follow this?" If the answer is no, add more documentation, clearer error messages, or a simpler default.
