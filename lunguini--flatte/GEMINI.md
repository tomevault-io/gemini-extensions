# Flatte Development Guide

Flatte (package `flatte`, module path `github.com/lunguini/flatte`) is a
functional TUI foundation for Go: single mutable state struct, `View` as a pure
function of state, direct mutation instead of TEA message dispatch, async
funneled through named `StateUpdate`s onto a single-writer loop. It is the
deliberate inverse of Bubble Tea while reusing Charm's MIT substrate (Lip Gloss
v2 for styling; ultraviolet for input parsing and cell-buffer rendering,
wrapped behind Flatte APIs).

## Mission and quality bar (read this first)

Flatte is being built to be **the production-grade, idiomatic-Go Bubble Tea
alternative** — software teams ship on and depend on, not a research spike.
**This is not experimentation.** The phased roadmap and the "abstraction is
found, not designed" rule are about *engineering rigor* (don't add surface
ahead of evidence), **not** about hedging on whether to deliver. We are
committed to carrying the roadmap through a 0.1 release, then to a 1.0 once
community feedback and API stabilization justify it.

What that means in practice, on every increment:

- **Reliability and correctness are non-negotiable.** Treat it as if critical
  systems depended on its correctness. Every code path is tested; no path is
  left "probably fine."
- **Full QA, every time:** TDD (red→green), unit tests for logic, golden
  snapshots for views, `-race` on touched packages, `go vet` on darwin **and**
  `GOOS=windows`, `gofmt` clean, and a real-terminal (TTY) pass wherever
  behavior is terminal-conditional. Benchmark goldens stay byte-identical.
- **Honesty over advocacy stays** — the evaluation log still records what got
  worse. Honest evidence is a *quality control*, not a sign of tentativeness.
- **Keep momentum.** Drive each well-scoped unit to done and continue to the
  next; don't stop to ask "should I proceed?" between them. Stop only when
  genuinely blocked, when a decision is truly the user's to make, or at a
  required TTY/verification gate. Finishing the roadmap is the job.

## Document map (read in this order for context)

Internal docs live under `.docs/` with **opaque filenames** (`d01.md`,
`d02.md`, …) so the public repo can't infer topics from names;
`.docs/index.md` (encrypted) maps each opaque name to its role — read it first.

| Document | Role |
|---|---|
| The design doc | Thesis, principles, architecture, phased roadmap. Direction lives here. |
| The status tracker | **Living implementation tracker** — what exists, known bugs, what's next per phase. Truth lives here. |
| The evaluation log | Evidence log from dogfooding — what extracted cleanly, what's worse or unproven. Append-only in spirit. |
| Plans | Implementation plans for individual pieces of work. |
| `README.md` | Public project introduction and minimal app. |
| `quick-reference.md` | Public API map for humans and AI agents building Flatte apps. |
| `examples.md` | Public sample catalog and what each sample demonstrates. |
| `AGENTS.md` | Contributor and agent workflow rules. |

## The `.docs/` folder (internal project docs; sensitive, git-crypt)

**All internal project documents live in `.docs/`** — design, status tracker,
evaluation log, plans, and any specs or design/brainstorm notes. Files use
**opaque names** (`dNN.md`); `.docs/index.md` (encrypted) maps them. There is
no `.specs/` folder and no `.docs/plans/` subfolder; use `.docs/` exclusively.
Public user-facing docs live at the repository root. Rules:

- **Rely on it.** Before designing, implementing, or claiming anything
  about project state, read the relevant `.docs` file first (use
  `.docs/index.md` to find it). The status tracker is the authoritative answer
  to "what's implemented and what's left" — trust it over assumptions, and
  verify it against code when in doubt.
- **Update it.** Any change that affects what these documents say (new
  feature, fixed bug, design decision, new finding) updates the matching
  `.docs` file in the same commit. A new internal doc takes the next free
  opaque name (`dNN.md`) and a row in `.docs/index.md` — never put the topic
  in the filename.
- `.docs/**` is encrypted with **git-crypt** (see `.gitattributes`). All
  sensitive or internal material goes under `.docs/`, never in public files or
  code comments. (`.specs/**` stays git-crypt-encrypted purely as a safety
  guard against accidental plaintext — it is not a place to put files.)
  git-crypt encrypts file *contents*, not *names*, which is why `.docs/` uses
  opaque `dNN.md` names mapped only in the encrypted `.docs/index.md` — keep it
  that way so the public repo leaks no topics.
- Do not copy `.docs` content into public files, commit messages, or
  README-style docs.
- If `.docs/` files look like binary garbage, the repo is **locked** — stop
  and ask the user to run `git-crypt unlock`. Never overwrite an encrypted
  blob with plaintext.

## Commands

```bash
go test ./...        # full test suite, includes golden snapshots
go vet ./...
cd cmd && go run ./flat-modal        # run a sample app (needs a real TTY)
```

Golden snapshots have **no auto-update flag**: when a view change is
intentional, edit the golden file under the sample's `testdata/` by hand
(or rewrite it from the test's "actual" output) and re-run the test.
Goldens are ANSI-stripped and pinned to a fixed render width — keep them
deterministic (no wall-clock, no randomness in `View`).

## Architecture

- root package `flatte` — the runtime: `App[S]`, `Run`, the closed event set
  + substrate event translation, `StateUpdate[S]`/`Async`, `Tracer`,
  cell-buffer rendering via ultraviolet. No app policy here, and no
  ultraviolet types in exported signatures.
- `flatui` — opt-in widget state structs and layout helpers (`TextField`,
  `Textarea`, `Viewport`, `List`, `Table`, `Tree`, `FocusRing`, `KeyMap`,
  `Progress`, `Spinner`, `Timer`, `Stopwatch`, `Card`, `Overlay`). Widgets own
  no goroutines, no hidden focus policy; apps store them in their own state.
- `flatest` — deterministic driver, fake-clock async harness, replay, and
  golden-test helpers.
- `cmd/flat-*` — dogfood sample apps; each has tests + goldens.
- `cmd/bubble-modal`, `cmd/bubble-v2-modal`, `cmd/bubble-v2-search` —
  Bubble Tea v1/v2 comparison apps. They are the benchmark; keep them
  compiling, don't "improve" them beyond parity with their Flatte
  counterparts.
- Sample/app frame composition should use `flatui/layout` by default. For
  anything beyond a trivial one-line frame, build a `layout.Node` tree and
  call `layout.SolveAndCompose`; do not hand-roll column splits, border/padding
  subtraction, joined panels, or frame-wide clipping with ad hoc Lip Gloss
  string composition. Manual string composition is acceptable only for tiny
  leaf content inside a layout node, or when a sample is explicitly dogfooding
  raw Lip Gloss behavior.

## Principles (the short version — full rationale in the design doc)

- **Single source of truth.** State lives in one place; one write site per
  piece of state. If you find yourself mirroring a value, the design is
  wrong.
- **View is pure.** `state -> frame`, no retained render state in app code.
- **No policy in core.** The framework never decides what `q` or `j` mean.
  Key parsing is neutral; bindings are app code. (This was violated twice
  and both were bugs.)
- **No messages.** Apps never define message types. Async results are
  named, self-applying `StateUpdate`s.
- **All mutation on the loop goroutine.** Async work is a goroutine that
  sends one named update back. No mutexes on state, no
  goroutine-per-component.
- **Abstraction is found, not designed.** Extract a helper only after the
  pattern repeats across samples; record the evidence in the evaluation log.
  Every roadmap phase is a decision gate.
- **Healthy abstractions: slightly opinionated, not confining.** An extracted
  API should have a clear point of view but never block the caller from doing
  something it didn't anticipate. If adding padding to a title breaks the
  header composer, the abstraction is too rigid — it baked in one usage
  pattern and called it a general API. Prefer composable primitives over
  fixed-arity helpers; prefer "here are the building blocks" over "here is
  the one shape I support." When in doubt, leave composition in the app and
  wait for the pattern to repeat.
- **Push back when there's a better way.** When a user proposes an
  abstraction, evaluate whether an existing type with a field covers the same
  ground before adding a new type, interface, or wrapper. The layout engine
  went through five iterations — `Box`, `ContentBox`, `Content`, `Element`
  interface + `El()`, then back to just `Node` with a `Layout func` field —
  because each request was implemented incrementally without stepping back to
  ask "is the overall shape right?" The lesson: when the third leaf
  constructor appears, stop and unify. One type with optional fields beats
  three types with overlapping semantics. "Better" means simpler when
  possible, but also more honest, more composable, more aligned with the
  actual problem — not just less code. Be a design partner, not just an
  implementer — say "there's a better way" before building the wrong version.
- **Agent-tractability is a design constraint.** A feature must be a
  local, compiler-visible edit. If adding something requires tracking
  non-local coupling, redesign it.

## Working conventions

- Commit messages must use Conventional Commits style: `type(scope): subject`
  when a useful scope exists, otherwise `type: subject`. Use standard
  release-driving types such as `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `test`, `refactor`,
  `perf`, `build`, `ci`, and `chore`; mark breaking changes with `!` and/or a
  `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer. Releases and `CHANGELOG.md` are automated from
  these messages by release-please (`.github/workflows/release-please.yml`);
  the public contributor-facing version of this rule lives in
  `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- **Update the status tracker in the same commit** as any change that adds,
  fixes, or removes something it lists. It is the answer to "what's done
  and what's left" — keep it honest, including the *Known bugs / debt*
  section.
- New findings from dogfooding (good or bad) get appended to the evaluation
  log, including what got worse. Honesty over advocacy.
- Tests are the verification path: `Handle` + field asserts, `StateUpdate`
  applies, golden views. Don't build a TTY harness to test logic.
- The Bubble Tea comparison apps exist to keep the claims honest — when a
  Flatte API changes shape, check whether the comparison table in the
  evaluation log is still true.
