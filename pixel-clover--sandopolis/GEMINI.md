# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to coding agents collaborating on this repository.

## Mission

Sandopolis is a portable and accurate multi-system Sega emulator for Genesis, Master System, Game Gear, and SG-1000, written in Zig (and C).
Priorities, in order:

1. Correct emulation behavior and compatibility.
2. Clear timing and subsystem interactions.
3. Maintainable boundaries between frontend and core emulation logic.
4. Performance, but only after correctness is covered by tests.

## Core Rules

- Use English for code, comments, docs, and tests.
- Prefer small, focused changes over broad rewrites.
- Ensure the project is modular and components are decoupled with clean APIs and interfaces.
- Keep emulator state instance-bound inside the existing structs (`Bus`, `Vdp`, `Io`, `Z80`, `Cpu`, and `AudioOutput`).
- Avoid introducing a new global mutable state.
- Keep SDL/frontend logic in `src/main.zig` and `src/frontend/`; keep core emulation logic in `src/`.
- Keep SDL3 portable in the build graph: use the Zig-native SDL3 build (`castholm/SDL`) plus `zsdl` bindings, and do not hard-code platform binary
  artifacts such as `lib/libSDL3.so` in `build.zig`.
- Add comments only when they clarify non-obvious hardware behavior or timing.

Quick examples:

- Good: add a VDP timing helper inside `src/video/vdp.zig` with module-local tests.
- Good: add a regression ROM boot assertion in `tests/regression_tests.zig`.
- Bad: move emulator core behavior into `src/main.zig`.
- Bad: add a new debug-only behavior path without tests.

## Writing Style

- Use Oxford commas in inline lists: "a, b, and c" not "a, b, c".
- Do not use em dashes. Restructure the sentence, or use a colon or semicolon instead.
- Avoid colorful adjectives and adverbs. Write "TCP proxy" not "lightweight TCP proxy", "scoring components" not "transparent scoring components".
- Use noun phrases for checklist items, not imperative verbs. Write "redundant index detection" not "detect redundant indexes".
- Headings in Markdown files must be in the title case: "Build from Source" not "Build from source". Minor words (a, an, the, and, but, or, for, in,
  on, at, to, by, of) stay lowercase unless they are the first word.

## Repository Layout

- `src/main.zig`: SDL frontend, event loop, rendering, audio device setup.
- `src/api.zig`: API/doc entrypoint used for generated documentation.
- `src/public/`: deliberate public API facade type (`Machine`) exposed from `src/api.zig`.
- `src/testing/`: explicit testing facade used by non-unit suites that need lower-level control than `Machine` alone exposes.
- `src/testing_root.zig`: root module used for internal testing facades that need broader access than `src/testing/` alone.
- `src/bus/`: cartridge loading/persistence, memory map, open-bus behavior, Z80 arbitration, and VDP/audio timing coordination.
- `src/scheduler/`: frame/master-clock scheduling.
- `src/cpu/`: 68K/Z80 wrappers, runtime hooks, CPU-facing memory interface, and the local jgz80 bridge C code.
- `src/audio/`: sample-based YM2612 FM synthesizer (`ym2612_sample.zig`, runtime), cycle-accurate Nuked OPN2 core (`ym2612.zig`, validation), SN76489
  PSG with bipolar output, blip-buffer band-limited resampler, board analog LPF, 3-band parametric equalizer, and the output mixing pipeline.
- `src/input/`: controller I/O and configurable input mapping.
- `src/recording/`: GIF animation recording with LZW compression and crash-safe output, WAV audio recording, and BMP screenshot capture.
- `src/video/`: VDP and video timing/rendering logic.
- `src/sms/`: Sega Master System and Game Gear emulation: VDP Mode 4, memory bus with Sega mapper, I/O port dispatch, Z80-based machine, PSG-only
  audio, GG 12-bit CRAM, and GG viewport cropping.
- `src/frontend/`: SDL frontend helpers including config, UI state, save manager, menu, dialog, toast, and performance overlay logic.
- `src/unit_test_root.zig`: internal test root that aggregates module-local unit tests for `zig build test-unit`.
- `src/wasm.zig`: WebAssembly export layer wrapping the Machine API for browser deployment.
- `src/wasm_stubs.c`: minimal C stubs (setjmp/longjmp and main) needed for WASM builds.
- `src/libretro.zig`: Libretro core shared library wrapping the Machine API for RetroArch and other Libretro frontends.
- `src/system.zig`: system type detection (Genesis, SMS, or Game Gear) from ROM headers and cartridge region codes.
- `src/system_machine.zig`: `SystemMachine` tagged union abstracting Genesis and SMS/GG for the SDL frontend.
- `src/rom_loader.zig`: ROM file loading with ZIP archive extraction (deflate and stored).
- `src/`: remaining core emulator modules (`machine.zig`, `cli.zig`, `performance_profile.zig`, `rom_metadata.zig`, `state_file.zig`, etc.).
- `tests/`: non-unit suites only:
    - `integration_tests.zig`
    - `regression_tests.zig`
    - `property_tests.zig`
- `tests/testroms/`: local (public-domain and community) ROMs for testing and hardware verification; see `tests/testroms/README.md`.
- `roms/`: local ROMs for manual testing only; this directory may be absent.
- `tools/`: developer-only utilities that are not part of the shipped emulator runtime.
- `external/`: optional checked-out third-party source trees used for developer tooling or reference comparison, not default runtime dependencies.
- `web/`: browser frontend for the WebAssembly build (HTML, JavaScript, and AudioWorklet). `web/img/` and `web/sandopolis.wasm` are
  generated by `make web` and gitignored.
- `docs/assets/overlays/`: libretro common-overlays assets (Genesis button icons, CRT bezel) under CC BY 4.0; source of truth for
  `web/img/`.
- `tmp/`: scratch/reference material only; do not treat it as the Sandopolis source, and it may be missing.
- `build.zig.zon`: source dependencies only. Avoid adding checked-in platform binary packages when an upstream source dependency is available.

## Testing Layout Rules

- Unit tests belong in the Zig module they exercise.
- `zig build test-unit` collects module-local unit tests through `src/unit_test_root.zig`.
- Integration, regression, and property-based tests belong in `tests/`.
- Non-unit tests should use the public API from `src/api.zig`. If they need lower-level control than `Machine` exposes, add or extend the explicit
  `sandopolis.testing` facade instead of re-exporting raw core structs.
- `tests/integration_tests.zig` is for stable public-API and cross-module wiring coverage that is not tied to a specific bug history.
- `tests/regression_tests.zig` is for bug reproductions, timing regressions, and ROM-backed behavior checks.
- `tests/property_tests.zig` is for invariant-style and randomized coverage.
- ROM-dependent tests belong in `tests/regression_tests.zig`.
- `tests/testroms/` contains community test ROMs for hardware verification. Use these for targeted regression tests against known hardware behavior.
  `roms/` is for local game ROMs used in manual testing only.
- If you move code across modules, move or rewrite the unit tests with it.

## Architecture Constraints

- `Bus` is the central coordination point for memory, timing, Z80 arbitration, VDP progression, and audio timing.
- `scheduler/frame_scheduler.runMasterSlice()` is the authoritative scheduler path for frame execution.
- Timing-sensitive changes must respect the interaction between:
    - `Bus.stepMaster()`
    - `scheduler/frame_scheduler.runMasterSlice()`
    - `Cpu.stepInstruction()`
    - `Vdp.progressTransfers()`
    - `AudioTiming.consumeMaster()` and `Z80.setAudioMasterOffset()` (audio event timestamps)
- The jgz80 C bridge (`src/cpu/jgz80_bridge.c`) owns the YM/PSG event ring buffers and register shadows. Audio event flow crosses a Zig/C boundary;
  changes to audio event capture or draining must account for both sides.
- The PSG is reachable from both the Z80 (address `0x7F11`) and the M68K (VDP port `0xC00011`). Both paths must push timestamped events through the
  Z80 bridge.
- Keep frontend concerns separate from emulation concerns.
- Preserve MIT-license boundaries. Treat external emulator repos and AGPL code as references unless licensing has been reviewed explicitly.
- `external/Nuked-OPN2` is an optional LGPL developer-reference dependency. Keep it isolated to the `compare-ym` tool and never make it part of the
  default `sandopolis`, `check`, `test`, or release build paths.

## Workflow

Before coding:

1. Identify whether this is a timing, API, frontend, or docs change.
2. Read the touched module and existing nearby tests.

Implement using red-green TDD:

1. Write a failing test first that describes the expected behavior (red).
2. Run the test and verify it fails for the right reason.
3. Write the smallest implementation that makes the test pass (green).
4. Refactor if needed while keeping tests green.
5. Run the narrowest relevant test target while iterating (`zig build test-unit`, `zig build test-integration`, etc.).
6. Run `zig build check` and `zig build test`.
7. Update docs (`README.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `src/api.zig` exports) if behavior or workflow changed.

Additional validation when relevant:

- `zig build test-frontend` when touching frontend helper functions or UI state logic.
- `zig build docs --prefix .` for docs/API/build-doc changes.
- `make test` / `make docs` when touching the Makefile or contributor workflow.
- `zig build run -- <path-to-rom>` for frontend/manual runtime checks.
- `zig build compare-ym -- [scenario]` when touching YM2612 synthesis and the Nuked submodule is available.
- `zig build wasm` when touching `src/wasm.zig`, `src/wasm_stubs.c`, or core modules to verify the WebAssembly build still compiles.
- `make web-serve` to build and test the browser frontend locally.

Audio investigation workflow:

- Prefer `-Doptimize=ReleaseSafe` for ROM-backed audio investigation unless you specifically need `Debug`.
- Start cross-emulator FM investigation with `zig build trace-ym-writes -- ...` to compare Sandopolis YM register streams against a reference
  emulator.
- If ROM-backed YM output diverges but the raw YM core already matches reference scenarios, use `zig build trace-z80-audio-ops -- ...` to inspect the
  executed Z80 audio-mapped write order before changing `ym2612.zig`.

Optimize mode guidance:

- Do not use the default `Debug` build for normal game execution or long ROM/audio comparisons unless you specifically need debug assertions or
  traces.
- Prefer `-Doptimize=ReleaseSafe` for most emulator investigation work: it is much faster than `Debug` while keeping safety checks enabled.
- Prefer `-Doptimize=ReleaseFast` for long gameplay runs, performance-sensitive audio capture, and other throughput-heavy manual checks.
- Keep `Debug` for narrow tracing, stepping, and assertion-heavy debugging where runtime speed is not important.

## Testing Expectations

- No emulation behavior change is complete without tests.
- Timing, DMA, VDP, scheduler, controller, and bus arbitration changes need explicit coverage.
- Prefer targeted assertions over broad snapshot-style tests unless the behavior is naturally end-to-end.
- Keep tests deterministic and avoid hidden dependencies on local state beyond explicitly referenced ROMs.
- Initialize only the state you need, drive the relevant API directly, and assert on observable behavior.
- When uncertain about emulator correctness, add or refine tests first.

## Documentation Expectations

- Public-facing API docs are generated from `src/api.zig`. Keep it focused on deliberate public surfaces: do not re-export raw internal coordination
  types like `Bus`, `Cpu`, `Vdp`, or `Z80`; add facade/view types instead.
- User workflow changes should update `README.md`.
- Progress/completeness changes should update `ROADMAP.md`.
- If you detect stale docs while changing related code, fix them in the same patch.

## Review Guidelines (P0/P1 Focus)

Review output should be concise and only include critical issues.

- `P0`: must-fix defects (incorrect emulation behavior, severe regression, broken build/test workflow).
- `P1`: high-priority defects (likely timing bug, incorrect subsystem coupling, missing validation for risky change).

Use this review format:

1. `Severity` (`P0`/`P1`)
2. `File:line`
3. `Issue`
4. `Why it matters`
5. `Minimal fix direction`

Do not include style-only feedback or broad praise.
