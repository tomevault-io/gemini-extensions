# Project context

This repository is a **.NET e-commerce microservices monorepo**. It is **not** a multi-tenant SaaS monolith. Treat each microservice as an independent, deployable unit that follows the repo-default Clean Architecture + Vertical Slices shape ([ADR-0012](../docs/adr/0012-clean-arch-vsa-default-service-shape.md), [docs/PATTERNS.md](../docs/PATTERNS.md)) and shares cross-cutting concerns through narrow `ECommerce.Shared.*` capability packages.

For the authoritative architectural overview, read [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md) and [CONTEXT.md](../CONTEXT.md). Behavioral coding guidelines live in [.claude/CLAUDE.md](../.claude/CLAUDE.md).

## Repo shape

- Top-level `*-microservice/` folders, plus `api-gateway/` and `shared-libs/`.
- Each service is its own solution defined by a **`.slnx`** file. There is no root solution that builds everything.
- All projects target **`net10.0`** (see [Directory.Build.props](../Directory.Build.props)).
- `local-nuget-packages/` is a local NuGet feed used to consume shared-libs capability packages.
- Service code defaults to `Features/<Slice>/`, `Domain/`, `Contracts/Integration/`, and `Infrastructure/`; documented divergences live in each service's `CLAUDE.md`.

Services and ports (from [docker-compose.yaml](../docker-compose.yaml)):

| Service | Port | Datastore | Responsibility |
|---|---:|---|---|
| Basket | 8000 | Redis | Shopping cart CRUD and product price caching |
| Order | 8001 | SQL Server + Redis | Order creation, confirmation, cancellation, and order events |
| Product | 8002 | SQL Server | Product catalog and product price events |
| Auth | 8003 | SQL Server | User JWTs, service tokens, and JWKS discovery |
| API Gateway | 8004 | SQL Server | YARP/Ocelot routing, auth enforcement, combined Swagger UI, and DLQ operator API |
| Inventory | 8005 | SQL Server | Stock levels, reservations, backorders, and inventory reply events |
| Shipping | 8006 | SQL Server | Shipment lifecycle and shipment reply events |
| Payment | 8007 | SQL Server | Payment authorization, capture, void, refund, and payment reply events |
| Saga | 8008 | SQL Server | Owns order saga state; drives Order/Inventory/Payment/Shipping via commands |

## Tech stack (actual)

- **Language / runtime:** C# (latest), .NET 10
- **Web:** ASP.NET Core **Minimal APIs** (no MVC controllers, no MediatR)
- **Persistence:** EF Core with **SQL Server** (Redis only for basket and as order cache)
- **Messaging:** RabbitMQ by default or Azure Service Bus via `Messaging:Provider`, wrapped by `IEventBus` from `ECommerce.Shared.EventBus` and provider-aware composition from `ECommerce.Shared.Messaging`
- **Observability:** OpenTelemetry, Jaeger, Loki, Grafana, Prometheus (see `observability/` and `kubernetes/`)
- **Containerization:** Docker / Docker Compose; Kubernetes manifests under `kubernetes/`
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions runs build verification (`docker-build.yml`) and QA smoke checks (`smoke-test.yml`) as CI gates; Azure Pipelines (per-service `azure-pipelines.yml`) is the deployment path.
- **Cloud target:** Azure (AKS manifests prefixed `aks-*` in `kubernetes/`)

## Build, test, run

Operate **per service**. There is no root build.

```bash
# Build / test a service (run from its directory)
cd order-microservice && dotnet build
cd order-microservice && dotnet test
cd order-microservice && dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~OrderEndpointTests"
cd order-microservice && dotnet test --filter "DisplayName~Given_X_When_Y_Then_Z"

# Format (mirrors pre-commit)
dotnet format --verify-no-changes --verbosity minimal
dotnet format

# Full stack
docker compose up --build
docker compose up sql rabbitmq redis -d   # infra only
```

`Directory.Build.props` enables `TreatWarningsAsErrors` and `EnforceCodeStyleInBuild`. The documented `NoWarn` exemptions (`CA1707`, `CA1711`, `CA1716`, NuGet `NU*` warnings) are intentional — do not "fix" code to remove them.

## Pre-commit (Husky.Net)

`.husky/task-runner.json` runs on commit:

1. `dotnet format --verify-no-changes`
2. `dotnet build --no-restore`
3. `dotnet test basket-microservice/Basket.Service.slnx --no-build --no-restore`

Only Basket tests run pre-commit. Run other service test suites manually before pushing changes that cross service boundaries.

## Shared library workflow (`ECommerce.Shared`)

Shared-libs are consumed as **NuGet packages**, **not** `<ProjectReference>`s. Since [ADR-0013](../docs/adr/0013-shared-libs-multi-package-split.md), production services use direct capability packages (`ECommerce.Shared.Kernel`, `.EventBus`, `.RabbitMq`, `.AzureServiceBus`, `.Messaging`, `.DeadLetter`, `.Platform`, `.Contracts`, `.Testing.Qa`) and avoid the umbrella `ECommerce.Shared` package unless broad compatibility is intentional. Use [docs/runbooks/shared-libs-versioning.md](../docs/runbooks/shared-libs-versioning.md) for package selection and version sweeps.

After editing the shared lib:

```bash
dotnet pack -c Release shared-libs/ECommerce.Shared.slnx
cp shared-libs/**/bin/Release/*.nupkg local-nuget-packages/
# Bump <Version> in shared-libs/Directory.Build.props if consumers should pick it up.
```

Consumers won't see changes until the version is bumped and the new `.nupkg` lands in the local feed.

## Cross-service architecture

The "big picture" lives in three places that have to be read together:

1. **Each service's `Program.cs`** — composition root. All wiring uses extension methods from the direct shared-libs packages: `AddSqlServerDatastore`, `AddOutbox`, `AddPlatformEventBus`, `AddPlatformEventPublisher`, `AddPlatformSubscriberService`, `AddEventHandler<TEvent, THandler>`, `AddPlatformObservability`, `AddPlatformHealthChecks`, `AddPlatformOpenApi`. New cross-cutting concerns belong in the matching shared-libs capability package, not duplicated per service.

2. **`shared-libs/ECommerce.Shared.*` capability packages**
   - `Kernel` / `EventBus` — event base, options, `IEventBus`, keyed handler registration, transactional outbox.
   - `Messaging`, `RabbitMq`, `AzureServiceBus` — provider selection via `Messaging:Provider`; RabbitMQ uses fanout exchange `ecommerce-exchange`, Azure Service Bus uses topics/subscriptions, and both preserve the same event contracts.
   - `DeadLetter`, `Platform`, `Contracts`, `Testing.Qa` — DLQ capture/replay, auth/observability/health/OpenAPI, saga commands, and QA seeding helpers.

3. **Saga orchestrator** — Saga service starts from `OrderCreatedEvent`, persists saga state, and drives Order/Inventory/Payment/Shipping through commands. Participants publish reply events with `SagaId` and `CausationId`; Saga advances, retries, or compensates from those replies. Event and command handlers live under service `Features/<Slice>/` folders.

## Service internal layout

Each service follows the Clean Architecture + Vertical Slices default from [ADR-0012](../docs/adr/0012-clean-arch-vsa-default-service-shape.md) — keep this split:

- `Features/<Slice>/` — Minimal API route handlers, read/write DTOs, event handlers, command handlers, and slice DI.
- `Domain/` — aggregates, invariants, domain events, and domain abstractions.
- `Contracts/Integration/` — portable cross-service event and reply payloads.
- `Infrastructure/` — EF Core, Redis, broker adapters, external providers, internal outbox endpoints.
- `Migrations/` — EF Core migrations (auto-generated, do not hand-edit style).

DTOs for a vertical slice live with that slice. Domain types stay under `Domain/`. Do not reintroduce the legacy top-level `Endpoints/` / `ApiModels/` / `Models/` / `IntegrationEvents/` layout for new work.

## API Gateway provider switch

The gateway compiles **both** YARP and Ocelot. `Gateway:Provider` (env `Gateway__Provider`) selects at startup; values `Yarp` (default) or `Ocelot`. Unknown values fail fast. Logged at boot as `ApiGateway starting with provider=...`. Routes, port, auth, health checks, and metrics are identical across both — clients do not change when switching.

## Conventions

- File-scoped namespaces; `var` preferred; `using` directives outside the namespace (enforced by `.editorconfig`).
- **Test names use `Given_When_Then` with underscores** (`CA1707` is suppressed).
- Event-handler classes are named `*EventHandler` and implement `IEventHandler<T>` (`CA1711` is suppressed).
- EF Core migrations under `**/Migrations/*.cs` are marked `generated_code = true` — do not hand-edit style.
- Each service implements `IDesignTimeDbContextFactory<TContext>` so `dotnet ef migrations add ...` works without running `Program.cs`.
- Integration tests use `WebApplicationFactory<Program>`; each service exposes `public partial class Program { }` at the bottom of `Program.cs` to enable this.
- Logging: built-in `ILogger<T>` + OpenTelemetry → Loki. Serilog is **not** used.
- Configuration via `appsettings.json` + `appsettings.{Environment}.json`; secrets via environment variables in compose / Kubernetes.

## Behavioral guidelines

[.claude/CLAUDE.md](../.claude/CLAUDE.md) defines general behavior (think before coding, simplicity first, surgical changes, goal-driven execution). Apply it to all work in this repo:

- Make only the changes the user asked for; do not "improve" adjacent code.
- Match existing style even if you'd write it differently.
- Prefer the smallest correct change. Push back when something looks over-engineered.
- For non-trivial work, state a brief plan with verifiable success criteria before implementing.
