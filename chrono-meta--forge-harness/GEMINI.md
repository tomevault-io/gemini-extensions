## Relationship to CLAUDE.md

| File | Scope | Audience |

| `AGENTS.md` | Portable runtime rules, agent roles, dispatch boundaries | AI runtimes + humans |

`CLAUDE.md` governs Claude-native automation. This file is the portable entry point for Codex and
other non-Claude runtimes, which do not auto-load `.claude/rules/*.md`.

## Agent Registry

forge-harness ships 8 tracked agents. The user-mastery spectrum (`beginner` · `main-player` ·
`expert`) plus `challenger` supplies multi-persona review; the remaining agents serve harness
operations or steel-quench.

| Agent | File | Role | Invoked by |
|---|---|---|---|
| `beginner` | `plugins/fh-meta/agents/beginner.md` | First-contact cold read; finds onboarding friction | `sim-conductor` Area A, `marketplace-gate`, `install-wizard`, direct |
| `main-player` | `plugins/fh-meta/agents/main-player.md` | Engaged-user view; scopes Light/Midcore/Heavy usage | `sim-conductor` Area A/D-code, direct |
| `expert` | `plugins/fh-meta/agents/expert.md` | Web-grounded domain accuracy and current practice | `sim-conductor` Area E/D, paper review, direct |
| `challenger` | `plugins/fh-meta/agents/challenger.md` | Evidence-cited adversarial evaluation | `steel-quench`, `harvest-loop`, `sim-conductor`, direct |
| `fact-checker` | `plugins/fh-meta/agents/fact-checker.md` | Pre-recommendation duplicate and stale-fact search | Before new asset creation or recommendation |
| `hub-persona-auditor` | `plugins/fh-meta/agents/hub-persona-auditor.md` | External-facing pre-publication persona audit | `harness-pr-reviewer`, `sim-conductor`, direct |
| `quench-challenger` | `plugins/fh-commons/agents/quench-challenger.md` | Steel-quench attack plus concrete fix direction | `steel-quench` Wave 1, `install-doctor`, `marketplace-gate` |
| `persona-innovator` | `plugins/fh-meta/agents/persona-innovator.md` | Naming gaps, frame proposals, frontier signals | `sim-conductor` Area A, `harvest-loop`, direct |

### Tool restrictions

| Agent | Allowed tools |
|---|---|
| `challenger` | Read, Grep, Glob, WebSearch, WebFetch |
| `fact-checker` | Read, Grep, Glob |
| `hub-persona-auditor` | Read, Grep, Glob |
| `quench-challenger` | Read, Grep, Glob |
| `persona-innovator` | Read, Grep, Glob, WebSearch, WebFetch |
| `beginner` | Read |
| `main-player` | Read, Grep, Glob |
| `expert` | Read, WebSearch, WebFetch |

The table is the whole roster — all eight agents above appear here. *Three were missing until
2026-08-11; the omission read as "unrestricted" to anyone checking this page, which is the wrong
default for a table whose subject is restriction.* Cross-check with the files themselves rather
than trusting either side alone: the same audit found `challenger` documented here with a tool set
its file never declared at all.

## Runtime Boundaries

- **Two layers:** `tracks/`, `knowledge/`, and skill methodology are model-agnostic. Plugin agents,
  hooks, slash commands, and `.claude/rules/` automation are Claude-native.
- **Output residency:** reusable methodology and polished public guidance belong in `knowledge/`,
  `plugins/`, or `docs/`. Raw signals, operator observations, handoffs, audit logs, and private
  reasoning are private-first; do not infer that colocated directories share a repository.
- **Runtime authority:** a non-Claude sidecar returns evidence candidates, never the terminal verdict.
  The governor must source-close each finding against a local file hit, literal source span, or
  passing check. Governor agreement alone is not an anchor.
- **Sidecar write boundary:** a sidecar audits; it does not write to the target tree. Return
  findings, and at most a proposed patch as text — the governor applies it. This is not a
  courtesy: measured 2026-08-21, an auditor sidecar edited the tree directly and its own fix
  introduced a self-referential fail-open that 41 existing lanes passed.
- **Sidecar completion:** judge a sidecar only by the typed verdict from `scripts/sidecar_wait.sh`.
  Never infer completion or emptiness by looking at its output file.
- **Identity grades:** the five-identity grade table is canonical only in
  `knowledge/shared/harness-core/ship_readiness_gate.md`. Do not restate grades from memory or from
  a session card — cite that file's current state.

## Mandatory Non-Claude Checklist

Because non-Claude runtimes do not auto-load Claude path rules, apply these rules explicitly:

1. **FH asset change:** before editing, read `.claude/rules/fh_4axis_gate.md`; before the first commit,
   run its required axes. Treat `templates/regression_guard.sh` exit 0 as PASS or SKIP; use its typed
   result channel and never report SKIP as checked.
   🟥 **New blocking condition, 2026-08-30**: editing a `.md` under `knowledge/` or `docs/` now
   **blocks the commit** if a world-scoped novelty/absence claim ("선례가 없다", "유일하게",
   `no prior art`, `unprecedented`, …) stands with **no external anchor within ±6 lines**.
   Anchors the check accepts: a URL · arXiv/DOI · `WebSearch`/`WebFetch` · `출처` · `원문 확인` ·
   `서베이`. Override is `FH_NOVELTY_OK=1`, and it appends to `tracks/_meta/.novelty_override_log`.
   ⚠️ The check sees only that an anchor **exists**, never that it supports the claim.
1-b. **Before you trust the gate at all: check that this checkout is WIRED.** 🟥 Every "the hook
   blocks this" sentence in `CLAUDE.md` and in item 1 above is true **only in a checkout where
   `core.hooksPath` points at `templates/.git-hooks`.** Git tracks the hook files; it does **not**
   carry that config value. Measured 2026-09-21, same commit, two checkouts: **15 layers compared,
   only 4 READ layers matched — all 11 ENFORCE/EVIDENCE/PATTERN layers were opposite.** The same
   commit passed silently in one and was blocked by Axis 2+3 in the other; what differed was the
   wiring, not the code.
   🟥 **The dangerous direction is the quiet one**: a gate that PASSED and a gate that NEVER RAN
   print the same thing — nothing. A third direction is quieter still: with the pattern layer
   absent the confidentiality scan still runs and still goes green, while company-name and
   real-name classes are simply `UNSCANNED`.

   ```
   bash scripts/env_layer_fingerprint.sh          # PRESENT/ABSENT/UNMEASURED per layer, no values
   bash scripts/gate_bootstrap_ephemeral.sh --check   # rc=1 while anything is missing
   bash scripts/gate_bootstrap_ephemeral.sh --apply   # wires hooksPath + UTF-8 locale
   ```

   Three things are needed and only two are mechanizable: ⓐ the `core.hooksPath` wiring ⓑ a
   **UTF-8 locale** (under `LC_CTYPE=POSIX` all four non-vacuity legs of an honest Korean marker
   are rejected as "vacuous" — over-blocking, the opposite failure) ⓒ the two gitignored evidence
   files, which **a human writes**. 🟥 The bootstrap script deliberately does **not** create
   markers — auto-generating evidence is closing the gate with a forgery.
   ⚠️ `scripts/fh_node_check.sh` cannot warn you here: it travels the same gitignored channel as
   the `settings*.json` it would read, so on an unwired node the detector is absent too.
   Detail: `knowledge/shared/harness-core/checkout_layer_drift.md` §8.

2. **Company residency:** raw company source, secrets, hostnames, internal names, stack traces, and
   unredacted findings never leave the local machine, including to same-family cloud models. Only a
   sanitized summary may leave; exceptions require explicit operator approval and a gitignored note.
3. **Author exposure:** before calling a material work product done, identify the author's blind spot
   and run the matching `agent-composer` Author-Exposure lens. The lens supplies evidence, not a verdict;
   unclear exposure defaults to `challenger`.
4. **Intent marshaling:** general work is in scope. Enumerate installed skills, `LOCAL_SKILL_REGISTRY`,
   and mapped project assets before composing capability. Preserve each trust tier and each outward
   action gate. Declare a gap only with the scan cited, then route through internal registry search,
   external search, and in-session synthesis. Persist and install retain their existing gates.
5. **Measurement integrity:** before trusting a scan or count, run a known-positive and known-clean
   pair, then open one hit manually. An empty or failed scan is `UNMEASURED`, not zero; extreme results
   require instrument suspicion.
6. **Irreversible intent:** before publish, delete, or history rewrite, read and apply the
   Pre-Publish or Destructive-Op gate in `CLAUDE.md`. `pre-push` is only the git-side backstop.
   **An automated verdict never clears an irreversible gate on its own, whatever its measured error
   rate.** Surface class decides, not the number: a wrong finding on a review surface costs a reader
   a minute, while on publish/delete/rewrite the wrong call is the whole loss. So improving a verdict
   engine's score is not a route to promoting it onto an irreversible surface — the terminal step
   stays a human or an explicit logged override. This matters here because a non-Claude runtime
   reading this file is itself often the verdict engine in question.
7. **Self-contrast on asset touch:** the trigger for the three-layer self-contrast (process ·
   engines · identities) is *touching an FH/PMH asset*, not being asked. Pick verification axes by
   failure mode — running all six every time is not the rule. Record, in the existing Axes 2–3
   marker fields: the soul line written before design (or `none`), each axis run and not run — by
   name, and each axis's control with whether it survived. The minimum evidence that an axis ran is
   execution output with a live control; reporting an axis as run without one, or recording only a
   reason for not choosing it, is not compliance. The axes are named in
   `knowledge/shared/harness-core/fh_three_layer_canon.md` — **§1-a is the original four
   (2026-08-09) and §1-a-2 expanded them to six (2026-08-16)**: ⓐ different family · ⓑ standpoint ·
   ⓒ isolated grounding · ⓓ third-party encounter · ⓔ first real use · ⓕ revert-and-observe.
   Axes are separated by **what they received**, not by how adversarial they are — same input,
   same blind spot, however many reviewers you add. ✅ **The machine layer now carries all six**
   (2026-08-17): a marker dated on/after that day must write `axes-run:` with the **circled keys**
   `ⓐ=… ⓑ=→standpoint ⓒ=… ⓓ=… ⓔ=… ⓕ=…`; markers dated earlier keep the old **ASCII four**
   (`a b c d`) and are not retroactively blocked. 🟥 **The two arrays are not the same letters —
   old `b` (first real use) is now `ⓔ`, old `d` (revert probe) is now `ⓕ`.** Copying an old line
   forward silently swaps two axes and raises no error. **Which array a marker used is decided by
   the date in its filename** (`< 2026-08-17` = old four). ⚠️ The notation is NOT the discriminator
   — that claim stood in this file for part of 2026-08-17 and a hand-count of the corpus refuted it:
   2 of the 4 circled-key markers on disk are dated 2026-08-10 and carry the OLD meanings. Aligning
   the notation still helps going forward; it does not work backwards.
   `standpoint:` remains the canonical field for ⓑ (the `axes-run` entry
   is only a pointer to it, and a pointer at an empty field is blocked). 🟥 **CORRECTED 2026-08-20.** This used to say
   "its value enum is still validated by nothing" — FALSE. `validate_standpoint_leg()` in the
   pre-commit hook enforces a closed enum. Measured by varying one variable at a time:
   `standpoint: banana(qasp)` → **blocked (enum)** · `standpoint: tier2` without parens → **blocked
   (enum)** · `standpoint: tier2(qasp)` with no execution grounds → **passes with a warning** ·
   with grounds → **passes**. So the enum is enforced and the `tier2`+ execution grounds are
   **advisory** — a first version of this correction said grounds were required, which over-shot.
   The hook also cannot check whether `tier2` is **true**. Those two, together, are the gap. Format spec: `.claude/rules/fh_4axis_gate.md §Marker axis fields`.
   (Two drift corrections landed here on 2026-08-17: first this sentence said "four" while its own
   next clause described the +1 — caught by the session-close ④-b CC↔Codex parity check — and then
   the machine layer moved to six the same day.)
   ⚠️ Until 2026-08-17 this entry point added "**ⓓ has no field at all** — record it in prose".
   That is now **false**: `ⓓ=` is a required key like the rest. The retraction is kept visible
   rather than deleted, because a Codex-side reader who memorised the old line would otherwise
   keep writing markers without ⓓ and see them blocked with no idea why.
   🟥 ⓑ **standpoint is itself split** (2026-08-17): a STATIC read of the target's own files is
   `tier1b` and **executes nothing**; `tier2`+ asserts that something was RUN — the discriminator is
   mechanical, *name the command you ran and the output you saw*. Measured on one delta: the static
   arm found 1, running the target's own suite found 2 more, one of which printed neither `FAIL` nor
   `❌`. Execution is the half with no substitute; see `field_verdict_crossfamily_gate.md §7`. Read it before recording; §1-c
   holds the sample limits — read it before citing. This record is self-attested and has no hook
   behind it; it is closed by a different-family reader, not by writing it more carefully.
   🟥 **`axis2-defense:` — a marker field added 2026-08-20 that a Codex-side author WILL hit.**
   It is required when the marker records `floor-status: sonnet-floor` or `below-floor`, and it carries
   three sub-answers (on one line, or across continuation lines — the hook reads both) about **your own findings and numbers**:
   `axis2-defense: reproducibility=<exact command or file:line another session runs> fairness=<reps,
   inputs and environment named for BOTH arms> estimation-layer=<per number: measured | estimate |
   quotation; for a measurement, what showed the instrument works on this target>`.
   The hook (`validate_defense_leg`) checks **presence · completeness · non-vacuity** — `ok`/`yes`/
   `n/a` is rejected as a filled form rather than an answer, and all three sub-answers must exist.
   It cannot check whether the answers are true. Why it exists: measured n=6 in the origin field, a
   floor-tier pass runs the attack angles without defect but does **not** spontaneously ask these
   three; that is a checklist gap, not a capability gap, and a harness whose behaviour depends on
   which model drives it is defective by the Sonnet-Floor doctrine.
   Fixtures: `scripts/test_marker_defense_lanes.sh`. Spec: `plugins/fh-meta/skills/steel-quench/SKILL.md`
   §Wave 1-D. **Recorded here because a rule living in only one entry point is invisible to the other
   runtime** — that is the gate-locality principle, and this line is it being applied rather than cited.

   🟥 **`defeater:` — required on markers dated 2026-09-01 or later. A Codex-side author WILL hit this.**
   One line answering **「if this success definition is wrong, what would be OBSERVED?」**
   The hook (`validate_defeater_leg`) checks **non-vacuity only** (6+ words) — it cannot check whether
   the answer is true. Markers dated before 2026-09-01 are **not** retroactively affected
   (same grace pattern as `SOUL_PRESENT_GRACE_DATE`).
   `defeater: 없음` / `none` / `n/a` is **legal** — a declared absence is a value, not silence.
   **`affected:` — OPTIONAL since 2026-09-04 (absent = pass, gradual adoption like `tenets:`).** One
   line naming what this change touches (people · harnesses · surfaces) plus any open question
   (`… · 열린 질문 = …`). When present, the hook (`validate_affected_leg`) blocks only a bare placeholder
   (`없음` / `TBD` / `-` / `n/a`), a duplicate line, or a near-miss key (`affects:`, `affected :`) —
   it never judges whether the content is true. Origin: the AI-Native SDLC playbook's intent.md
   «Affected users and systems / Open questions» sections, absorbed as one field (PR #624).
   **`oracle:` — OPTIONAL since 2026-09-05 (absent = pass).** One line `oracle: <kind> — <grounds>`,
   kind ∈ closed enum `known-pair` · `metamorphic` · `back-to-back` · `a-b` (`A/B` accepted) · `human` ·
   `none` — the test-oracle type of ISO/IEC TR 29119-11, i.e. *what the expected result was decided
   against*. When present, the hook (`validate_oracle_leg`) checks **form only**: enum membership
   (the kind must be followed by a delimiter or end of line — `known-pair2` / `human_review` are not
   members), non-vacuous grounds (≥2 words, no placeholder — and `none` MUST carry its reason), a
   single line, and near-miss keys by one rule: **any line whose key starts with `oracle` but is not
   exactly `oracle:`** (examples, not an enumeration: `Oracle:` `oracles:` `oracle :` `oracle　:`
   `oracle_type:` — a qasp-side author will reach for that one — `oracle-type:` `oracle.evidence:`,
   bare `oracle`) plus the typos `orcale:` `oralce:` `오라클:`, blocked even when a correct `oracle:`
   line is also present. Consequence: the `oracle*` key namespace is reserved by this field — no
   separate `oracle-…:` field can be added later. It never judges whether that oracle was actually
   used. Named residuals (marker-wide, not specific to this leg): grounds containing the hint's
   literal `<...>` are blocked (same boundary as `affected:`/`defeater:`); a line that STARTS with
   U+3000 or carries an embedded CR is outside `[[:space:]]`/line-wise grep and is not seen. Fixtures:
   `scripts/test_marker_oracle_lanes.sh` · wiring `scripts/test_hook_leg_wiring_lanes.sh` W6.
   🟥 A near-miss key (`defeaters:`, `반증:`, `defeater :`) is **blocked even when a correct
   `defeater:` line also exists** — the author believes they wrote it and the gate cannot read it,
   which is the quietest failure. Two `defeater:` lines are also blocked (readers take the first,
   so an appended correction is silently shadowed).

   Two more fields landed the same day, neither of them blocking-on-absence:
   - `tenets:` — **optional**. If you cite IDs, every `FH-T\d\d` on that line must exist in
     `.claude/soul_tenets.txt` (a typo is blocked rather than silently dropped). Citations are read
     **from that line only** — naming an ID elsewhere in the marker is description, not citation.
   - `soul-check:` — a closed enum **when present**; its absence passes (adoption is incremental).

   External grounding for the shape (not invented here): atomic testable tenets

   ([Assurance 2.0](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10474)) · the ≤7 / priority-ordered /
   **opposite-must-be-defensible** discipline

   Fixtures: `scripts/test_marker_soul_tenet_lanes.sh` · `scripts/test_hook_leg_wiring_lanes.sh`.
   Spec: `.claude/rules/fh_4axis_gate.md` §Marker axis fields.
   🟥 **Why this entry exists at all**: the CC-side spec did not describe `soul:` for **nine days**
   while the hook was already blocking on it, and a blind floor-tier sim measured three arms writing
   every other marker field and omitting that one. The defect was the wiring, not the model — and
   a rule living in only one entry point is invisible to the other runtime.

   ⚠️ **Also for Codex-side authors: `sim_isolated_run.sh` was not isolated until 2.14.0.**
   Arms could read outside the clone — including the answer key of the very measurement they were
   part of. Any sim number produced with ≤2.13.0 needs re-measuring.

8. **Branch-surface claims:** GitHub branch protection is two independent layers — legacy
   protection and rulesets coexist, and the strictest wins. Read both
   `/repos/{owner}/{repo}/branches/{branch}/protection` and
   `/repos/{owner}/{repo}/rules/branches/{branch}` before declaring any branch surface open or
   closed. In the reference repository (forge-harness), reading the protection object alone
   misjudged the force-push surface three times; the symmetric single-endpoint case is untested,
   but the same failure shape applies.

9. **Shared checkout:** when more than one session works in one clone, the working tree and `HEAD`
   are shared, so a branch switch moves the other session's ground. Before `git switch`, read the
   live head with `git branch --show-current`; immediately after cutting a branch, run
   `git log main..HEAD --oneline` — a non-empty result means the branch was cut on top of someone
   else's commits, and a later squash of the parent closes the child PR. The claim files under
   `.git/fh-claims/` are a snapshot written at claim time, not a lock: they do not update when
   somebody moves a branch, so they answer a different question than the two commands above.
   Record a switch with `scripts/branch_claim.sh claim`; the pre-commit hook blocks a commit whose
   claim does not match the live head. In a shared checkout `git add -A` and `git stash` both reach
   the whole tree, including another session's uncommitted work — stage by explicit path instead.

## Invocation

Non-Claude runtimes apply methodology manually. Prefer `FH_BACKEND=codex ... fh-run` for skills and
agents. When a workflow references `Agent(subagent_type=...)` or a slash command, replace that step
with `fh-run` or a direct `codex exec` call that reads the relevant spec. Use Codex native goal/session
control; FH supplies the quality gate after goal completion.

| Tier | Definition | Skills |
|---|---|---|
| **M1 — Full** | No Claude-native dependency | `token-budget-gate`, `asset-placement-gate`, `phantom-quench`, `deep-clarify`, `convergence-loop`, `ko-tech-writer` (visual-QA degrades to text-only; the spoken register's Step 5-s renders audio through a shell TTS call — available here — but its **listening** pass is human in every runtime, so it degrades to declared-unmet, not to a Codex-specific gap) |
| **M2 — Partial** | Core works; native agent or slash-command steps need adaptation | `deliberation`, `steel-quench`, `harness-doctor`, `context-doctor`, `sim-conductor`, `harvest-loop` |
| **M3 — Claude-only** | Requires a Claude hook or session-scoped dispatch | `goal-quench`, `harness-pr-reviewer`, `install-wizard` |

### Before dispatching without being asked

FH treats isolated delegation as part of what a harness *is*, so it leans toward dispatching rather
than absorbing separable work inline. One boundary comes with that, and it is runtime-agnostic:

```
unprompted dispatch is available only when a standing request from the user is RECORDED —
  in a durable local file, carrying all three of:
    the user's own words, quoted   · a dated lease   · a scope line
no such record, or the lease has lapsed, or you cannot tell (fresh clone · a runtime whose
  own prompt may restrict this)
  → the request is absent, and absent is not granted → ask per invocation
```

Four notes for anyone porting this. A record is only a record if the *user* authored the quoted
words — an agent writing the file on its own initiative has produced nothing. Consent is **leased,
not owned**: past the lease date the record stops counting and you go back to asking. Every run that
proceeds *without* a prompt should say that it is doing so, so an unnoticed grant cannot accumulate
silently. And the request buys not-being-asked about the dispatch; it never relaxes a gate at what
the dispatched agent then touches (publish, delete, history rewrite).

The Claude-side rationale — including why the boundary is phrased around a *conditional* rather
than a prohibition — lives in `CLAUDE.md §Agent Dispatch Operation` and is specific to that runtime.
The constraint above is not.

> removal makes a reader answer *confidently wrong* counts as load-bearing, not as safe to drop.
> **And the trap that produces a wrong CUT most easily**: when both arms score the *same*, that is
> equally consistent with the section being redundant and with the scorer never having moved. The
> two are indistinguishable from the outcome alone. Before writing a CUT on equal scores, name an arm
> that MUST score differently and show the metric moved on *that* pair; if it did not, the verdict is
> `INSTRUMENT-UNCONFIRMED`, not `CUT` (added to the script header 2026-08-23, §7).
