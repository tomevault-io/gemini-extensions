Mobile-first PWA for contacts, Nostr messaging, and Lightning/Cashu payments. Local-first architecture using Evolu for offline storage and cross-device sync.

See @README.md for project overview.

## Commands

```bash
bun install                # Install dependencies
bun run dev                # Start Vite dev server
bun run build              # Production build (tsc -b && vite build)
bun run site:dev           # Start the public Linky website for linky.fit
bun run site:build         # Build the public Linky website
bun run native:android:add # Generate the Capacitor Android project once
bun run native:apk:debug   # Build the web app, sync Capacitor, assemble debug APK
bun run native:apk:release # Build the web app, sync Capacitor, and assemble a signed release APK
bun run native:aab:release # Build the web app, sync Capacitor, and bundle a signed release AAB for Play upload
bun run native:ios:add     # Generate the Capacitor iOS project once
bun run push:dev           # Start the Bun push notification service in watch mode
bun run push:start         # Start the Bun push notification service once
bun run check-code         # Run ALL checks: typecheck → eslint --fix → prettier --write
bun run typecheck          # TypeScript type checking only
bun run eslint             # Lint + autofix all workspaces
bun run prettier           # Format + autofix all workspaces
```

IMPORTANT: Always run `bun run check-code` after making changes. It runs typecheck first, then eslint and prettier which autofix what they can. If typecheck or non-autofixable eslint errors remain, fix them manually and re-run until all checks pass.

Native Android builds require Java 17. `apps/native-shell/scripts/with-java17.sh` prefers an installed macOS JDK 17 automatically before running Capacitor/Gradle commands, and `apps/native-shell/scripts/patch-android-java.sh` rewrites Capacitor-generated Android compile options from Java 21 to Java 17 after add/sync.

## Monorepo Structure

- `apps/site/` - Public marketing/landing website intended for `linky.fit`
  - includes a feature-video showcase fed from static assets in `apps/site/public/videos/`, with mobile viewport-triggered playback, desktop hover-triggered playback, and automatic once-only progression to the next clip
  - landing CTA offers Web app, Google Play, and APK targets; it defaults to Web app generally, but prefers Google Play when the browser is on an Android phone
  - landing page and `/cashu` share a top-right site menu with language + display-currency selectors and a CTA into `https://app.linky.fit`; `/cashu` uses the selected display currency for its token amount header, with `₿` still meaning sats rather than whole bitcoin
  - `/cashu` token launch now prefers the native `cashu://receive?token=...` deep link, falls back to installed PWA handling via `web+cashu://receive?token=...`, and only then falls back to the browser `https://app.linky.fit/#wallet?cashu=...` import route
  - Vercel rewrites `/.well-known/lnurlp/:user` and `/.well-known/nostr.json` into `apps/site/api/` serverless handlers so apex `linky.fit` can expose LNURL/NIP-05 while forwarding to `NPUBCASH_BASE_URL` (default `https://npub.linky.fit`); LNURL responses rewrite the returned callback back to the apex host
  - includes a dedicated `cashu/` entry page for `linky.fit/cashu`, which can ingest a token from manual paste, query string, or preferably URL hash, inspect the token client-side, present `Vyzvednout v Linky` / primary Linky-open CTA first, reveal QR-copy plus Lightning-address redeem flow behind a secondary `Další možnosti` toggle, and redeem to a Lightning address; redeem sends the maximum LN-address amount the mint+LNURL flow allows, queues anonymous payment telemetry to the same collector/feed used by the app, and forwards any leftover token value as a private Nostr gift wrap to the configured collector `npub` from a one-time sender identity instead of returning change
- `apps/web-app/` - Main React app (Vite + SWC)
  - non-essential startup network work now defers until after the first idle window while the browser is online via `src/hooks/useDeferredOnlineReady.ts`; first render should prefer local Evolu/localStorage state, with fiat-rate refresh, mint-info refresh, relay probing, push bootstrap, and Evolu server probing catching up later
  - PWA manifest registers `web+cashu` protocol handling to route installed-app launches into `/#wallet?cashu=%s`, letting the site prefer installed PWA over plain browser tabs when the native app is unavailable
  - wallet receive (`#wallet/topup`) keeps the amount-entry invoice flow, now also exposes secondary `No amount`, `Paste`, and `Scan` actions at the bottom, and `#wallet/topup/no-amount` renders a reusable QR from the user's lightning address for amount-less LNURL-pay receipts
  - own profile uses a dedicated `#profile/edit` route for editing; the top-left profile avatar modal remains for viewing QR/profile share info and its edit action now opens that standalone page instead of inline modal editing, and `#profile/claim-lightning` lets users check availability and price for a custom `@linky.fit` lightning address, pay the quote in-app, publish the chosen `lud16`, and re-activate the currently paid hosted alias later with one tap; the profile editor hides the default `Restore` button while such a paid alias exists
  - when a user owns a paid `@linky.fit` alias, hosted mint sync for that alias must keep targeting `https://npub.linky.fit` even if the current profile `lud16` points somewhere else; if the hosted mint update fails, Linky must not persist the new local main-mint choice as if it succeeded
  - display-unit preferences now live on the dedicated `#settings` page reached from the menu `Jednotky` row; users toggle which currencies are allowed there, defaulting to language currency plus `sat`, can also enable a hidden `*****` unit that masks amounts across the app, and wallet balance / amount-entry displays cycle through the allowed currencies on tap
  - chat now supports Cashu payment requests: the composer shows a `Request` action next to `Pay`, request messages are sent as NUT-18 `creqA...` payloads over the existing NIP-17 DM flow, and request cards render `Requested` / `Paid` / `Declined` status with in-chat `Pay` and `Decline` actions
  - profile now publishes the small exchange-currency status as NIP-38 `kind:30315` with `d=general`, storing the checked `BTC`, `CZK`, `USD` list as the status content, the contacts list renders fetched statuses in small italic text next to names, and the contact filter bar exposes parsed status currencies like `CZK` as quick filters
  - Outgoing Cashu payments select a single mint that can cover the payment amount; Linky does not split one payment across token balances from multiple mints
  - Token list (`#wallet/tokens`) offers a `Melt to [main mint]` action beneath the `moje` token pills; it picks the non-main mint with the largest accepted-token balance, pays a fresh top-up quote on the selected main mint with those tokens, retries with slightly lower amounts when melt fees require it, and stores any source-mint remainder plus the newly minted main-mint token back into Evolu
  - changing the selected main mint now warns before auto-swapping an eligible balance away from the previous main mint; declining the warning switches mint anyway but disables `cashuAutoswap`, and selecting a test mint disables `cashuAutoswap` automatically
  - When the Advanced setting `cashuAutoswap` is enabled (default on, persisted to `linky.cashu_autoswap.v1`), the same melt-to-main-mint flow also runs automatically a few seconds after a foreign-mint accepted token appears, debounced per `mint+sum+count` signature so a single failed attempt does not loop
  - Cashu token detail uses the receive-invoice style card, shows the token amount above a larger centered QR, hides the raw token string, and lets accepted own tokens be manually marked `reserved` so they stay out of the spendable balance until marked available again
  - Wallet token flow is split into a main `#wallet/tokens` page plus dedicated `#wallet/token/new` import and `#wallet/token/emit` issuance pages; the main list shows `moje` tokens separately from `emitované` ones, and issued/externalized/pending tokens stay out of the spendable balance
  - Wallet now also exposes a small `Transakce` / `Transactions` link from `#wallet` to a dedicated `#wallet/transactions` page that lists all known Evolu-backed payment history rows
  - Transaction history merges an emitted Cashu token row into the later successful payment row when that exact issued token is subsequently spent, so emit-then-send appears as one history item
- `apps/native-shell/` - Capacitor native shell that consumes the built `apps/web-app/dist` bundle for Android/iOS packaging
- `apps/push/` - Bun HTTP push service for Web Push subscription auth/storage and Nostr outer-inbox relay watching
  - ships with `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.example.yml`, and `.env.production.example` for container deployment with persistent SQLite storage under `/data`
- `packages/core/` - Core package workspace (Effect-based identity domain in `src/identity/` with branded schemas + derivation utils, shared derivation paths in `src/identity/derivationPaths.ts`, and `MasterSecretProvider` SLIP-39 layer constructors, exported via `@linky/core` and `@linky/core/identity`)
- `packages/config/` - Shared ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript configs
- Package manager is **Bun** (not npm/yarn/pnpm)
- Workspace filter: `bun run --filter @linky/web-app <script>`

## Architecture

- Public website lives in `apps/site/` and is intended for a separate deploy on `linky.fit`; the product PWA stays in `apps/web-app/` for `app.linky.fit`
- `apps/site/` must stay a non-PWA marketing site: no web manifest, no service worker registration, and install prompts should only come from `app.linky.fit`
- `apps/site/cashu/` is a separate MPA entry for direct `/cashu` loads; Cashu token privacy should prefer hash fragments (`/cashu/#cashu...`) because query strings are sent to the server on the initial request
- **No framework router** - hash-based routing via `useRouting` hook and `parseRouteFromHash()` in `src/types/route.ts`
- Empty or unknown hashes now default to the wallet route; contacts use `#contacts` and legacy explicit `#` still opens contacts
- Navigation uses `navigateTo()` from `src/hooks/useRouting.ts` - do NOT use `window.location` directly
- **Evolu** for all persistent data - local-first SQLite with sync. Schema in `src/evolu.ts`
- Nostr chat persistence is Evolu-backed (`nostrMessage` + `nostrReaction` tables) and uses deterministic `messages-n` owner lanes for seed logins (derived from SLIP-39/BIP-85 path family `m/83696968'/39'/0'/24'/4'/<index>'`); legacy `linky.local.nostrMessages.v1.<ownerId>` data is imported once per owner via `linky.messages_evolu_migrated_v1:<ownerId>`
- Inbox sync now keeps unknown-sender conversations local-only until the user explicitly adds the sender as a real contact; unknown threads use `unknown:<pubkeyHex>` chat ids, are derived from the message overlay rather than stored as Evolu contacts, and auto-load Nostr kind-0 name/photo metadata while keeping the localized unknown-name prefix in UI
- Deleting a known Nostr contact now reassigns its local chat history into the corresponding `unknown:<pubkeyHex>` thread so future inbox sync dedupes correctly and the conversation continues as an unknown chat instead of replaying stale notifications
- Inbox sync/chat sync only persist decrypted inner rumor content from `kind: 1059` gift wraps; nested NIP-44 ciphertext is rejected when it decrypts against the sender/tagged peer or the outer wrap pubkey so outer payload blobs are not shown as messages
- Linky now publishes both NIP-65 relay metadata (`kind:10002` with `r` tags) and NIP-17 DM inbox relays (`kind:10050` with `relay` tags) from the user's configured relay list so external clients can discover where to deliver gift-wrapped DMs
- Inbox sync/chat sync also reject malformed inner `kind: 14` events that reuse the outer gift-wrap pubkey, preventing random wrapper keys from surfacing as unknown-message ciphertext threads
- Unknown-chat warning panel supports `Add contact` (creates a real contact with the best available Nostr name, while the localized `[Unknown]` / `[Neznámý]` prefix stays UI-only until the contact is saved, migrates existing unknown-thread messages to the new contact id, keeps user in the same chat) and `Block` (confirms, adds pubkey to `linky.blocked_nostr_pubkeys.v1`, publishes a Nostr mute list `kind:10000` with the merged blocked `p` tags when the user has an active `nsec`, removes the local unknown thread immediately, and future inbox sync ignores the blocked pubkey)
- For seed logins, contacts writes are routed through deterministic Evolu `contacts-n` owner lanes (derived from SLIP-39/BIP-85 path family `m/83696968'/39'/0'/24'/2'/<index>'`); the shared `ownerMeta` lane stores separate per-scope pointer rows such as `contacts-<n>`, `cashu-<n>`, `messages-<n>`, and `transactions-<n>`, and contact reads aggregate all visible `contacts-n` lanes up to the active index so old contacts stay visible without copy-forward
- For seed logins, cashu token writes are routed through deterministic Evolu `cashu-n` owner lanes (derived from SLIP-39/BIP-85 path family `m/83696968'/39'/0'/24'/3'/<index>'`), with the active lane index mirrored in `ownerMeta` as `cashu-<n>`; cashu reads aggregate visible `cashu-n` lanes up to the active index so previously seen tokens remain dedupe-visible without copy-forward, and new writes no longer mirror into a contacts-aligned legacy lane
- For seed logins, active Nostr identity state is also mirrored into a dedicated deterministic Evolu `identity` owner lane (derived from `m/83696968'/39'/0'/24'/6'/0'`); the row stores the active `nsec`, `npub`, identity `source` (`derived` vs `custom`), and optional `switchedAtSec` cutoff used to ignore older incoming events after a custom override
- For seed logins, transaction writes/reads are routed through deterministic Evolu `transactions-n` owner lanes (derived from SLIP-39/BIP-85 path family `m/83696968'/39'/0'/24'/5'/<index>'`)
- AppShell subscribes Evolu sync for active seed lanes (`contacts-n`, `cashu-n`, `messages-n`, `transactions-n`, `identity`, and `ownerMeta`) via `useOwner`, so owner pointers/data converge across tabs/devices
- Contacts and cashu owner lanes auto-rotate independently on per-scope byte-budget thresholds with reserve (currently contacts `220`, cashu `170`) and enforce 1-minute per-type cooldown; contacts and cashu both stay pointer-only without copy-forward, and new cashu writes stay on the active cashu lane only
- Messages owner lane auto-rotate on its own reserved byte-budget threshold (currently `160`) with pointer-only switch (no message copy), and message/reaction reads aggregate all visible `messages-n` owners up to the active index while writes stay on the newest owner
- Transactions owner lane auto-rotate on its own reserved byte-budget threshold (currently `220`) with pointer-only switch (no transaction copy), and transaction/history reads aggregate all visible `transactions-n` owners up to the active index while writes stay on the newest owner
- Auto-rotation counters now derive deterministically from local Evolu history (`evolu_history`) plus synced `ownerMeta` rotation snapshots, rather than from per-browser localStorage edit counters, so different instances converge on the same remaining-edits value once they have the same local Evolu data
- Owner rotations are now pointer-only for contacts, cashu, messages, and transactions; historical lanes stay visible for reads instead of being pruned or copy-forwarded, and cashu duplicate prevention now guards new inserts by token/raw-token identity instead of mirroring rows into a legacy lane
- Contacts are capped per active contacts owner at `MAX_CONTACTS_PER_OWNER` (currently 100); when the active contacts owner fills up, Linky rotates to the next contacts owner while still reading older contacts owners
- Evolu debug views (`#evolu-current-data`, `#evolu-history-data`) scope contacts/history to active owner lanes, with history retaining one previous contacts lane as backup
- Core app remains local-first/client-side; optional background notifications are handled by the separate `apps/push` Bun service
- Payment result logging in `useOwnerScopedStorage` now also queues anonymous payment telemetry in owner-scoped localStorage; `useAnonymousPaymentTelemetry` flushes that queue after the fact over Nostr gift wraps to a fixed collector `npub` using one-off ephemeral sender keys, lease-locking against duplicate multi-tab sends so telemetry never blocks the payment path
- Native packaging uses a separate Capacitor shell in `apps/native-shell/` so Android/iOS project files stay isolated from the web app source tree
- Native shells now load bundled `apps/web-app/dist` assets by default; Capacitor live reload must be enabled explicitly via `LINKY_CAP_SERVER_URL` / `CAP_SERVER_URL` before `cap sync` / `cap open`, preventing packaged APKs from pointing at `127.0.0.1`
- Android debug builds now install side-by-side as package `fit.linky.app.debug` with launcher label `Linky Dev`, so they can coexist with the production app already installed on a phone; that side-by-side debug variant skips the Google Services plugin, so native FCM push stays disabled there unless a matching Firebase package is added later
- Android release AAB builds derive `versionName` from the workspace `package.json` version and derive `versionCode` from semantic version components (`major * 10000 + minor * 100 + patch`), with optional `LINKY_ANDROID_VERSION_NAME` / `LINKY_ANDROID_VERSION_CODE` overrides for special releases
- Web app Advanced settings version display is also derived from the workspace root `package.json` via `apps/web-app/vite.config.ts`, so product version bumps only need to happen in one place
- GitHub Actions workflow `.github/workflows/android-apk-release.yml` builds a signed Android release APK on version tags (or manual dispatch) and publishes `linky.apk` to GitHub Releases; the public site links the stable `releases/latest/download/linky.apk` URL
- GitHub Actions workflow `.github/workflows/android-play-internal.yml` builds a signed Android AAB on pushes to `main` and uploads it to the Google Play `internal` track using repository secrets for the upload keystore, Play service account JSON, and `google-services.json`
- Browser-only identity persistence is being moved behind platform adapters in `apps/web-app/src/platform/`; the Android shell provides encrypted secret-storage plus native QR scan, deep-link, notification-permission, safe-area, and NFC bridges via `apps/web-app/src/platform/nativeBridge.ts`, while the iOS shell currently provides local Capacitor plugins for Keychain-backed secret storage, native QR scan, and CoreNFC NDEF writing, and native push registration now uses Capacitor Push Notifications + FCM token registration against `apps/push`
- Android native push delivery now uses data-only FCM payloads plus `apps/native-shell/android/app/src/main/java/fit/linky/app/LinkyFirebaseMessagingService.java`, which renders closed-app notifications locally and forwards payload extras back into `MainActivity` on tap; `google-services.json` is still required in `apps/native-shell/android/app/`
- Android shell now also exposes live system-bar inset values through `LinkyNativeWindowInsets`, and the web app consumes them via CSS vars (`--safe-area-top`, `--safe-area-bottom`) so the fixed top bar and bottom overlays clear Android status/navigation bars
- Onboarding/login uses a single 20-word **SLIP-39** share; Nostr keys default to the seed-derived path `m/44'/1237'/0'/0/0`, but Advanced settings can temporarily override the active Nostr identity by pasting a custom `nsec` and later restore the derived pair with `Derive`; contacts/tokens/messages/transactions stay on the same SLIP-39-derived Evolu owners, and incoming events for a custom identity are ignored when their inner `created_at` predates the stored `switchedAtSec`
- Unauthenticated restore now opens a dedicated `I'm returning` onboarding step with a password-style autofocused SLIP-39 input, manual/paste entry, inline separator normalization, live word validation, and clipboard-triggered auto-submit when a full valid share is pasted
- New account creation now pauses before first login on an unauthenticated profile-picker step: it derives one deterministic DiceBear avatar from the freshly generated `npub`, picks the suggested display name from a language-matched Czech or English name list based on the current app language, lets the user edit that name immediately, offers 8 trait-group edit buttons (top, hair color, accessories, eyes/brows, mouth, facial hair, skin, clothing) to refine that one avatar, supports uploading a custom square-cropped photo as a 9th option, and the welcome/unauthenticated screens expose the same language menu as the later onboarding steps; the visible confirm action now request-submits a separate hidden credential form containing the chosen name plus a generated 20-word SLIP-39 seed to maximize browser password-manager save heuristics before publishing initial kind-0 metadata and entering the app; the published metadata still includes name, picture, and the default `${npub}@linky.fit` `lud16`
- Hosted npub.cash-compatible claim/info/mint sync resolves the API origin from the active lightning-address domain; current mapping keeps default `@npub.cash` on `https://npub.cash` and routes `@linky.fit` through `https://npub.linky.fit`
- Cashu deterministic wallet seed is derived from the SLIP-39 secret using **BIP-85** at path `m/83696968'/39'/0'/24'/0'` (24-word mnemonic)
- Web app seed/identity helpers in `src/utils/slip39Nostr.ts` are app-level adapters that delegate SLIP-39/BIP-85 derivation to `@linky/core/identity`
- `apps/web-app/src/App.tsx` is a thin wrapper that default-exports `app/AppShell`
- App shell structure lives under `apps/web-app/src/app/`:
  - `AppShell.tsx` is a thin renderer/auth gate that wires `AppShellContextsProvider` and route content
  - `useAppShellComposition.tsx` owns AppShell orchestration, hook composition, and route-prop bundle assembly
  - `AppShellBoundaryMap.md` defines AppShell ownership boundaries and behavior invariants for split work
  - `context/ContextSplitContract.md` defines target context lanes, typed read hooks, and composition-to-context ownership mapping for the split plan
  - `context/AppShellContexts.tsx` is the single authenticated shell context transport; it provides shell/route contexts and typed consumer hooks (`useAppShellCore`, `useAppShellActions`, `useAppShellRouteContext`)
  - `hooks/` contains app domain hooks (`useRelayDomain`, `useMintDomain`, `useContactsDomain`, `useMessagesDomain`, `usePaymentsDomain`, `useCashuDomain`, `useProfileAuthDomain`, `useGuideScannerDomain`) plus app-shell extraction hooks (`useAppDataTransfer`, `useContactsNostrPrefetchEffects`, `useMainSwipePageEffects`, `useProfileNpubCashEffects`, `useScannedTextHandler`, `useFeedbackContact`, `useOwnerScopedStorage`, `usePaidOverlayState`, `useRouteDerivedShellState`)
  - `hooks/useEvoluContactsOwnerRotation.ts` owns deterministic contacts/cashu/messages/transactions owner derivation, pointer-only contacts/cashu/messages/transactions rotations, legacy cashu mirror upkeep for older clients, and per-scope owner pointer persistence in `ownerMeta`
  - `hooks/composition/` contains sub-composition slices for shell orchestration concerns (`useProfileAuthComposition`, `useProfilePeopleComposition`, `usePaymentMoneyComposition`, `useRoutingViewComposition`, `useSystemSettingsComposition`)
  - `hooks/contacts/` contains contact-editor and contact-list view helpers (`useContactEditor`, `useVisibleContacts`)
  - `hooks/layout/` contains extracted shell layout/menu/swipe state helpers (`useMainMenuState`, `useMainSwipeNavigation`)
  - `hooks/profile/` contains extracted profile editor and profile metadata sync flows (`useProfileEditor`, `useProfileMetadataSyncEffect`)
  - `hooks/messages/` contains extracted message/inbox effects (`useNostrPendingFlush`, `useSendChatMessage`, `useEditChatMessage`, `useSendReaction`, `useInboxNotificationsSync`, `useChatMessageEffects`)
  - `hooks/messages/chatNostrProtocol.ts` contains shared reply/edit/reaction Nostr parsing helpers used by sync/send flows
  - `hooks/payments/` contains extracted payment orchestration (`usePayContactWithCashuMessage`)
  - Lightning pay scan supports lightning addresses plus LNURL-pay bech32 / `lnurlp://` / HTTPS targets; LNURL-withdraw (`lnurlw`) QR scans now show the withdrawable sats for confirmation and then pull the amount into the wallet via the selected mint top-up flow; unknown recipients open the same amount-entry UI as contact pay, but without avatar/name until matched to a saved contact
  - `hooks/cashu/` contains extracted cashu helpers (`useSaveCashuFromText`, `useCashuTokenChecks`, `useRestoreMissingTokens`, `useNpubCashClaim`)
  - `hooks/topup/` contains extracted topup quote/reset effects (`useTopupInvoiceQuoteEffects`)
  - `hooks/mint/` contains mint-info store/helpers (`useMintInfoStore`, `mintInfoHelpers`)
  - `routes/AppRouteContent.tsx` handles route-kind page rendering
  - `routes/MainSwipeContent.tsx` handles contacts/wallet swipe UI
- `routes/useSystemRouteProps.ts` builds shared system/settings route prop groups
- `routes/props/` contains grouped route-prop builders (`buildPeopleRouteProps`, `buildMoneyRouteProps`, `buildMainSwipeRouteProps`)
- `lib/` contains shared app helpers (Nostr pool, token text parsing, topbar config)
- `types/appTypes.ts` contains app-local shared types
- `apps/push/src/` is split by concern: `http.ts` (Bun API, including `/native/subscribe` + `/native/unsubscribe` for Android FCM tokens), `ownership.ts` (signed challenge verification), `storage.ts` (SQLite persistence for web subscriptions, native tokens, pubkeys, challenges, seen outer event ids), `relayWatcher.ts` (relay subscription for outer `kind: 1059` events with catch-up vs live delivery gating), and `push.ts` (Web Push + Firebase Admin delivery with invalid subscription/token cleanup)
- Push service proof events use `kind: 27235` with short-lived per-pubkey challenge nonces; `/subscribe` and `/unsubscribe` both require valid proofs per affected pubkey, full unsubscribe only happens when the last proven pubkey is removed, the server never decrypts NIP-17 payloads, and it only emits generic notifications for outer `kind: 1059` events tagged `["linky","push"]`, so sender self-copies / reactions / edits can sync over relays without triggering push

## Code Conventions

- TypeScript strict mode with `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`
- **NEVER use `as` or `any` to cast types** - validate with a runtime type guard instead of casting
- Branded ID types from Evolu (`ContactId`, `CashuTokenId`, `MintId`, etc.) - don't use plain strings
- Components use `interface` for props, not `type`
- LocalStorage keys use `linky.` prefix (e.g., `linky.nostr_nsec`, `linky.lang`)
- Use types from libraries (e.g., Evolu, Cashu, Nostr) instead of redefining them - look up the library's exported types first
- Prefer sparse Evolu mutation payloads: omit optional fields when empty instead of writing explicit `null` (especially `cashuToken` optional columns like `rawToken`, `mint`, `unit`, `amount`, `error`)
- Owner rotation and contact limits use shared constants in `src/utils/constants.ts` (`OWNER_ROTATION_TRIGGER_WRITE_COUNT`, `OWNER_ROTATION_COOLDOWN_MS`, `MAX_CONTACTS_PER_OWNER`)
- Plain CSS in `App.css` - no CSS-in-JS or utility framework

## Testing

- **Playwright** E2E tests in `apps/web-app/tests/`
- **Vitest** unit tests (jsdom environment, Worker polyfill in `vitest.setup.ts`)
- Dev server for E2E: `http://127.0.0.1:5174`

## Gotchas

- Evolu requires a Worker polyfill in test environments
- In this workspace/Bun setup, `bunx --cwd apps/web-app playwright test tests` can resolve incorrectly; run `cd apps/web-app && bunx playwright test tests` instead
- SQLite WASM files served from `public/sqlite-wasm/` with `cache-control: no-store` in dev
- On web, the `nsec` private key is still mirrored under `linky.nostr_nsec`; native shells are expected to provide secure secret storage via the platform bridge and secrets must never be logged or exposed
- Android native shells currently back identity secrets with `EncryptedSharedPreferences`, use ZXing-based native QR scanning instead of `getUserMedia` when available, expose Android notification permission to the web app, and register Android FCM push tokens through Capacitor Push Notifications; native builds need `apps/native-shell/android/app/google-services.json`, and the push server needs `PUSH_FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` for delivery
- QR scanning now defaults to the shared web-app `getUserMedia` scanner UI across PWA and native shells so Android matches the same `ScanModal` and actions as the web app; animated QR reconstruction has been removed from the scan flow, and the Android native ZXing bridge remains present but is not the default scan flow
- Play upload bundles require release signing via `apps/native-shell/android/keystore.properties` or `LINKY_UPLOAD_STORE_FILE` / `LINKY_UPLOAD_STORE_PASSWORD` / `LINKY_UPLOAD_KEY_ALIAS` / `LINKY_UPLOAD_KEY_PASSWORD`; `bun run native:aab:release` fails fast when those credentials are missing
- Android native shells also register `nostr://` and `cashu://` custom URI schemes and forward incoming URLs through `LinkyNativeDeepLinks`; the current handler accepts contact `npub` links plus Cashu token links, reuses the scanned-text add/import flows, opens the saved contact detail, and imports tokens into the wallet
- Android native shells also accept NFC NDEF tags for the same flows: `ACTION_NDEF_DISCOVERED` URI records with `nostr://` / `cashu://` and `text/plain` NDEF records whose payload starts with those schemes are normalized in `MainActivity` and forwarded through the same deep-link bridge
- Android native shells also expose NFC writing through `LinkyNativeNfc`; token detail writes `cashu://cashu...` and profile writes `nostr://npub...` as NDEF URI records, with web-app UI hidden when the native bridge is unavailable
- Cashu tokens written to NFC remain listed as greyed `externalized` rows, are excluded from available balance and outgoing payments, and token check re-accepts them into a fresh spendable token; token detail also offers Share for the same `cashu://cashu...` deeplink used by NFC writes
- Cashu token soft-deletes MUST target the row's OWN owner lane, not the active write lane: Evolu materializes rows keyed by `(ownerId, id)`, so `update("cashuToken", {id, isDeleted}, {ownerId: activeLane})` silently no-ops on a row that lives in an older `cashu-n` lane (it writes a phantom row in the active lane and leaves the real spent token spendable, blocking later payments). Resolve the row's owner from the visible cashu owner ids via `resolveCashuRowOwnerLane` (`apps/web-app/src/app/lib/cashuOwnerLane.ts`) before deleting — used by the contact-pay swap delete, the pending-token cleanup effect, and `deleteSpentCashuTokens`
- Cashu wallet bootstrap now falls back through `apps/web-app/src/utils/cashuWallet.ts` when `cashu-ts` rejects a mint's keyset ID verification; this is currently needed for `https://testnut.cashu.space` so top-up/restore/send/melt flows can still initialize the wallet from the mint's direct `mintInfo` + `keysets` + `keys` responses
- Native scan/notification injected bridge methods must be invoked as bridge methods (`bridge.method()`), not detached function references, otherwise Android WebView rejects them as non-injected calls
- Wallet/contact QR scanning now keeps fallback actions available when camera permission is denied/unavailable
- Vite proxy: `/api/lnurlp` for LNURL-pay CORS workarounds; Cashu mint quote/check/mint calls go directly to the selected mint with CORS fetch options and do not pass quote ids or proofs through a Linky proxy
- Cashu topup invoice creation calls the mint `/v1/mint/quote/bolt11` endpoint directly on web and native; mint quote claim also calls the mint directly so Linky servers never see top-up quote ids or minted proofs
- PWA service worker is built from `apps/web-app/src/sw.ts` via Vite PWA `injectManifest`; changes there affect both prod and dev SW behavior
- Dev mode now keeps the registered PWA service worker alive for push testing; use `#advanced/push-debug` to inspect persistent client/SW push logs and manually reset service workers/caches when needed
- Push registration now validates the live `PushSubscription.options.applicationServerKey` against the current server VAPID public key and forces a re-subscribe on mismatch; open clients also re-register when the service worker emits `pushsubscriptionchange`
- Push registration persists a stable browser `installationId` plus the last server-registered endpoint in localStorage; subscribe calls also request cleanup of legacy subscriptions without an installation id for the same pubkey, the push server replaces stale endpoints for the same installation, and the client best-effort unregisters the previous endpoint with a signed unsubscribe proof when the browser rotates/replaces the current subscription, preventing duplicate generic notifications from old endpoints
- Cashu payments now publish actual token chat messages to the recipient without the outer push marker and emit one separate notify-only wrapped event per payment (`kind: 24133`, `["linky","payment_notice"]`) as the sole push trigger; receiver inbox sync never stores that notice in chat history, but the service worker and open-app notification paths render it as `You received money` / `Přijali jste peníze`
- The PWA service worker mirrors the active `nsec` into IndexedDB on app startup/login, clears it on logout, and for closed-app push delivery it fetches the outer `kind: 1059` event from relays, decrypts it locally in the service worker, uses `You received money` / `Přijali jste peníze` copy for Cashu token messages and notify-only payment notice events, and still shows a generic fallback notification when decrypt/validation fails; any open Linky window client still suppresses the service-worker notification in favor of in-app notification logic, while inbox sync keeps actual Cashu token chat messages silent in notification surfaces and uses the notify-only payment event for the user-visible payment alert
- Chat retention is enforced in `useMessagesDomain` (latest 500 messages/contact, 3000 global; reactions capped to 5000 and orphaned reactions are pruned)
- Wallet top-up receive quotes are cached in owner-scoped localStorage until claimed/expired, including the original invoice text, so Android/native resumes reuse the same quote instead of minting against a newly generated one; top-up mint claim must also treat Cashu `ISSUED` as claim-relevant and run `mintProofs` under the deterministic counter lock/retry flow used by other Cashu operations, otherwise paid invoices can fail silently with duplicate-output signing errors
- Push service env is documented in `apps/push/.env.example`; `PUSH_VAPID_SUBJECT`, `PUSH_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY`, and `PUSH_VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY` must be set before `apps/push` starts
- `apps/push` CORS allowlist is configured via `PUSH_CORS_ORIGIN`; it accepts `*` or a comma-separated list of allowed web app origins
- `apps/push` relay watcher defaults now match the web app chat publish relays (`wss://relay.damus.io`, `wss://nos.lol`, `wss://relay.0xchat.com`) unless overridden via `PUSH_DEFAULT_RELAYS`
- `apps/push` relay watcher uses a 3-day catch-up `since` window to accommodate NIP-59 randomized outer `created_at`, persists seen outer event ids in SQLite, keeps a size-bounded in-memory seen-id cache for O(1) hot-path dedupe checks, suppresses notification delivery until EOSE switches the watcher into live mode, periodically refreshes the subscription to reset reconnect `since` drift, and prunes both cache-expired ids and old SQLite seen-event rows on the server cleanup interval
- Container publishing is handled by `.github/workflows/push-image.yml`, which builds `apps/push/Dockerfile` and publishes the image to GHCR
