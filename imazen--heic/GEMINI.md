# HEIC Decoder Project Instructions

## ABSOLUTE MANDATE: NEVER STOP PUSHING FORWARD

**While working on a multi-step task in this repo, you do not stop, pause, lazily
ask "shall I continue?", or wrap up the session early — unless one of the
genuine stop conditions in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` ("NEVER PAUSE LAZILY") fires.**
The default is: ship the next chunk. Then the next. Then the next.

**Stopping criteria — these are the ONLY legitimate reasons to pause:**

1. The next step is **destructive or externally visible** (force-push, publish,
   posting outside this org, deleting shared state) — confirm per the global
   "Executing actions with care" rules.
2. The next step **branches in a way that's not derivable from prior
   instructions** — two equally-valid paths with no expressed preference.
3. You hit a **measured-and-verified** blocker (no GPU, no Apple HW, missing
   library version not on crates.io) and there is no chunk you can ship
   that doesn't depend on that block.
4. Native-API runtime tests across all six backend targets pass, AND every
   item on the user's last list is shipped or has a documented chunk that
   cannot be shipped today.

**Forbidden — these are NOT stop conditions:**

* "I've done a lot already, let me summarize."
* "Want me to keep going?"
* "Should I continue with X, or hold?"
* "The next step is heavy."
* "Compile takes a while."
* "CI is yellow on one job."
* "I'm not sure if you want me to..."
* End-of-session-feeling because the conversation is long.

If a chunk is genuinely too large to ship in one pass, decompose into the
smallest demoable chunk (per the global "NEVER GIVE UP ON A USER-DIRECTED
LIST" rule), land that chunk with a passing test, document the next chunk
with file paths + signatures, and **keep going on the next chunk** in the
same turn. Do not stop to ask.

## Writing Good Code — patterns imported from jxl-encoder

These patterns are mandatory reading and apply to every commit. Adapted from
`~/work/zen/jxl-encoder/CLAUDE.md` "Patterns of Mistakes to Avoid" + "Proof-
by-Tests Investigation Methodology" + "Invariant Preservation Across Sessions".

### 1. False positives are the highest-severity bug

Tests that pass without exercising the thing they claim to test are worse
than no tests — they manufacture false confidence and waste future
investigation time. For a decoder, "the parser accepted the bytes" is
**not** evidence "the image decoded correctly" — you must call all the
way through `decode_to_frame` / `to_rgba` / the backend's `decode_hevc`
and inspect actual pixels. The `mf_diff` example + zensim-regress corpus
diff are the canonical templates for this codebase.

Rules:
- **Never** declare a backend "works" based on `is_available()` alone.
  Decode example.heic via the backend and verify dimensions + pixel
  equivalence (zensim ≥ 95) against the rust backend.
- **Never** trust a test-count delta. Verify what the tests actually do.
- When fixing a "tests pass but it's wrong" bug, audit every other test
  that uses the same pattern.

### 2. Read existing docs before investigating

Before "investigating" any bug, read:

1. This file's "Known Bugs" and "Investigation Notes" sections.
2. `CHANGELOG.md` `[Unreleased]` and the most recent shipped version.
3. `git log --since="3 days ago" --oneline -30`.
4. `git log --grep="<error fragment>" --all`.
5. The relevant backend's `PORTING.md` if applicable.

If the bug is already documented, continue the existing investigation —
do not start a new note. Update in place.

### 3. Test the test infrastructure

When you add a test helper (corpus harness, fake fixtures, diff utility),
exercise it against known-good and known-bad inputs before relying on it.
A test helper bug is worse than the bug it's trying to catch — it
poisons every test built on top.

### 4. Documentation reflects what's verified, not what's intended

Before claiming a feature "works" in CLAUDE.md, README, CHANGELOG, or a
commit message:

- Decode a real HEIC end-to-end via the path being claimed.
- Compare against libheif / the rust backend / dec265 — at least two
  external sources of truth.
- For native backends, the bar is `compare_backends_via_zensim` reporting
  zero failed files in the bundled corpus.

Status markers (used in CLAUDE.md + CHANGELOG):

| Marker | Meaning |
|---|---|
| ✓ Complete | Works end-to-end, ≥ 2 cross-checks, runtime CI green. |
| ⚠ Partial | Some inputs work, others fail; failure mode documented. |
| ⚙ In Progress | Implementation exists, not yet exercised against real input. |
| ✗ Broken | Implementation exists, known-failing test pinned. |
| ❌ Not Started | No implementation. |

### 5. One commit, one complete fix

Multiple `fix: correct X` commits for the same `X` within a day means the
first fix was shipped without understanding. Before fixing a bug:

- Trace every consumer of the wrong data.
- Write a failing test that reproduces it.
- Understand **why** the bug exists, not just where.

After: verify with a different code path (e.g. the MF backend fix
verified via both `mediafoundation_alone_decodes_when_required` and the
corpus zensim diff).

### 6. Investigation lives in ONE place

CLAUDE.md "Investigation Notes" is the single source of truth. Do NOT
create `STATUS.md`, `NOTES.md`, `INVESTIGATION-of-foo.md` files — use
dated entries in CLAUDE.md instead. Multiple symptoms (UnexpectedEof,
InvalidEnum, byte corruption) may share a root cause; link related
findings instead of duplicating them.

### 7. Read code before claiming you understand it

Before committing an implementation:

- Read it line by line. Verify variable names match semantics
  (`crop_y` vs `coded_y`, `width` vs `coded_width`).
- Check that doc comments match what the code does.
- Verify every computed value is actually used (don't compute a value
  and then not consume it).

For ports (chromium → Rust):

- Read the reference implementation completely before writing the port.
- Don't assume "similar" Rust code does the same thing as the C++.
- Verify matching inputs produce matching outputs (parity tests).

### 8. Add tracing FIRST when writing bitstream / FFI code

For new bitstream paths or native FFI: add diagnostic logging *before*
shipping the first `unsafe` block. The `mf_diff` example was added
*after* example.heic was discovered to be broken — should have been
written the moment we started writing the MF unpacker. Future native
backends (D3D11VA, VA-API real decode): write the equivalent of
`mf_diff` for that backend before declaring decode "complete".

### 9. Proof-by-Tests investigation (layered invariants)

When debugging, build a stack of invariant tests from coarsest to finest
and commit each one as it passes:

- **Layer 0**: Does it compile? Do existing tests pass?
- **Layer 1**: Does the new component roundtrip in isolation?
- **Layer 2**: Does the byte-level serialization match the reference?
- **Layer 3**: Does the full pipeline produce output a reference decoder
  accepts? (libheif, dec265, the rust backend)
- **Layer 4**: Is the output perceptually correct on real photos?
  (zensim, SSIM2)

When a layer passes, record it in this file with the test name and the
commit hash. Don't re-investigate passed layers. Focus on the first
failing layer — that's where the bug lives.

### 10. Pre-commit checklist

Run before every commit:

```bash
cargo fmt --all
cargo clippy --workspace --features backend-rust -- -D warnings
cargo test --features backend-rust,std --lib
```

For changes to MF / VT / MediaCodec / VA-API / D3D11VA backends, also
verify the per-backend cross-compile path that matches CI:

```bash
cargo clippy -p heic-backend-mediafoundation --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu -- -D warnings
cargo clippy -p heic-backend-mediacodec --target aarch64-linux-android -- -D warnings
```

For MF-specific changes, run the Windows host tests via
`pwsh.exe -File V:\heic-win-test.ps1` and confirm 5/5 dispatch tests pass.

### 11. Bitstream / FFI tracing is permanent

`examples/mf_diff.rs`, `examples/probe_backends.rs`, the zensim corpus
diff harness — these stay in tree forever. They're the regression gate
that catches the next "chroma offset of 4 pixels" bug. Do not remove
them once they catch their first bug; they catch the next one too.

## Reference: chromium HEVC source

The chromium tree is sparse-checked-out at `~/work/chromium` with only
the HEVC-relevant files materialized:

* `media/gpu/h265_decoder.{cc,h}` — generic Accelerator-delegated
  decoder loop.
* `media/gpu/windows/d3d11_h265_accelerator.{cc,h}` — DXVA decode FFI.
* `media/gpu/vaapi/h265_vaapi_video_decoder_delegate.{cc,h}` — libva
  decode FFI.
* `media/parsers/h265_parser.{cc,h}` — SPS/PPS/slice header parsing.

Use these as reference when porting decoder paths. The
`heic-backend-d3d11va/PORTING.md` and `heic-backend-vaapi/PORTING.md`
guides cross-reference these files with line numbers.

Do NOT use web searches for HEVC spec details - read the spec sections or reference implementations directly.

## API Design

Follows the zen codec three-layer pattern from `/home/lilith/work/codec-design/README.md`:

```rust
// Simple one-shot
let output = DecoderConfig::new().decode(&data, PixelLayout::Rgba8)?;

// Full control with limits and cancellation
let output = DecoderConfig::new()
    .decode_request(&data)
    .with_output_layout(PixelLayout::Rgba8)
    .with_limits(&limits)
    .with_stop(&cancel)
    .decode()?;

// Zero-copy into pre-allocated buffer
let info = ImageInfo::from_bytes(&data)?;
let mut buf = vec![0u8; info.output_buffer_size(PixelLayout::Rgba8).unwrap()];
let (w, h) = DecoderConfig::new()
    .decode_request(&data)
    .with_output_layout(PixelLayout::Rgba8)
    .decode_into(&mut buf)?; // returns (width, height)

// Probe without decoding
let info = ImageInfo::from_bytes(&data)?;

// Raw YCbCr access
let frame = DecoderConfig::new().decode_to_frame(&data)?;

// HDR gain map
let gainmap = DecoderConfig::new().decode_gain_map(&data)?;

// EXIF/XMP extraction (zero-copy for single-extent, owned for multi-extent)
let exif: Option<Cow<'_, [u8]>> = DecoderConfig::new().extract_exif(&data)?;
let xmp: Option<Cow<'_, [u8]>> = DecoderConfig::new().extract_xmp(&data)?;

// Thumbnail decode (smaller embedded preview image)
let thumb: Option<DecodeOutput> = DecoderConfig::new().decode_thumbnail(&data, PixelLayout::Rgb8)?;
```

### Key Types
- `DecoderConfig` — HOW to decode (reusable, Clone)
- `DecodeRequest<'a>` — WHAT to decode (data + layout + limits + stop)
- `DecodeOutput` — decoded pixels (data + width + height + layout)
- `PixelLayout` — Rgb8, Rgba8, Bgr8, Bgra8
- `Limits` — max_width, max_height, max_pixels, max_memory_bytes
- `ImageInfo` — probe result (width, height, has_alpha, bit_depth, chroma_format, has_exif, has_xmp, has_thumbnail)
- `enough::Stop` — cooperative cancellation (re-exported)

### Dependencies
- `enough` — cooperative cancellation (Stop trait)
- `whereat` — error location tracking (At<E> wrapper)
- `archmage` — SIMD dispatch via CPU feature tokens
- `safe_unaligned_simd` — safe wrappers over std::arch intrinsics

## Code Style

- Use `div_ceil()` instead of `(x + n - 1) / n`
- Use `is_multiple_of()` instead of `x % n == 0`
- Collapse nested `if` with `&&` when possible
- Use iterators with `.enumerate()` instead of manual counters

### Current Quality (RGB comparison vs libheif)
- 103/162 test files decode successfully
- Best: example_q95 65.7dB (98% pixel-exact), classic-car 77.3dB (BT.709)
- Nokia C001-C052: 50.5dB (77% pixel-exact)
- Grid images: image1 50.4dB, classic-car 77.3dB
- Scaling list files: iphone_rotated 55.3dB (91% exact), iphone_telephoto 50.9dB
- All CABAC SEs match libde265 perfectly
- YUV-level: pixel-perfect for q50+ (76.1dB for q10, 128 Y-plane diffs vs dec265)
- Color conversion: ×8192 fixed-point for limited-range, ×256 for full-range
- example.heic: 73.0% pixel-exact, SSIM2 91.86, avg diff 0.45, max diff 12

### Known Edge Cases
- MIAF003 (4:4:4 chroma, RExt profile): 61.9dB (97.8% exact, max diff 4)
- overlay_1000x680: 13.1dB — remaining diff from color conversion on fill regions
- example_q10: 36.1dB RGB — low-QP amplifies color conversion rounding

### Performance
- Release profile: thin LTO + codegen-units=1
- Criterion benchmarks: 54ms example.heic (1280x854), 451ms iPhone sequential (3024x4032), 180ms parallel
- Callgrind (iPhone, scalar under valgrind): 5090M instructions
- Key optimizations applied:
  - Plane-direct writes, in-place dequant, border fill inlining (731M→653M)
  - Partial butterfly IDCT for 8/16/32 (decode_and_apply_residual -14%)
  - SAO edge interior/border split + lazy plane cloning (SAO -26%)
  - Color conversion: 4:2:0 specialization, ×8192 fixed-point (to_rgb -38%)
  - Row-slice bounds-check elimination in intra prediction and residual add
  - SIMD color conversion via archmage AVX2 (81M → 9.2M, -88%)
  - SIMD IDCT 8x8/16x16/32x32 via archmage AVX2 (madd_epi16 butterfly)
  - SIMD IDST 4x4 via archmage SSE4.1 (14.1M → 3.7M, -73%)
  - SIMD residual add via archmage AVX2 (u16+i16→clamped u16)
  - SIMD dequantize via archmage AVX2 (flat scale only; scaled uses scalar)
  - Intra prediction: early-exit substitution, hoisted bounds, halved arrays
  - Deblocking: direct plane access with step_along/step_across
  - Residual buffer reuse across TU decode calls
  - Tile-parallel grid decode via rayon: 451ms → 180ms (2.5x) for 48-tile iPhone image
  - Streaming decode_into for grids: bypasses full-frame YCbCr, color-converts tiles directly to output
- Remaining hotspots: decode_and_apply_residual (32%), predict_intra (17%), CABAC (10%), memcpy/memset (7%)

## Known Limitations

- Inter prediction (P/B slices) on `inter-prediction` branch:
  - Full pipeline: syntax parsing, merge/AMVP/TMVP, scalar MC, DPB, VideoDecoder
  - Conformance: 48/48 vectors decode without crash, 1 pixel-exact (I-only)
  - CABAC verified BIT-EXACT vs dec265 (all 28 CTU byte positions match for MERGE_A)
  - MERGE_A: frames 1-7 small deblocking diffs (29-349 pixels, max_abs 2-6), frame 0 exact
  - SAO_B (3x1 tiles): 12.9dB (all frames decode, no UNINIT)
  - Fixed bugs:
    - Tile boundary CABAC context: split_cu_flag, cu_skip_flag, SAO merge left/up now check same-tile availability (matching libde265 6.4.1)
    - Tile QP reset: QP prediction, is_cu_qp_delta_coded, StatCoeff reset at tile boundaries
    - Intra MPM tile awareness: get_neighbor_intra_mode_left returns DC for cross-tile neighbors
    - PCM mode: pcm_flag decode via decode_terminate, raw sample read, CABAC reinit (H.265 7.3.8.8)
    - SAO merge slice check: uses actual slice_segment_address instead of hardcoded 0
    - interSplitFlag: missing forced TU split when max_transform_hierarchy_depth_inter==0 and PartMode!=2Nx2N (H.265 7.3.8.7). Caused CABAC desync in RQT_A B-frame.
    - Temporal MVP fallback: only tried one collocated position (bottom-right OR center), but H.265 8.5.3.2.8 requires trying bottom-right first, then falling back to center when collocated block is intra
    - Small PU L1 restriction: nPbW+nPbH==12 rule unconditionally disabled L1, but H.265 8.5.3.2.2 step 10 only disables L1 when both L0 and L1 are active (bi-prediction)
    - ref_idx decode: truncated unary consumed extra CABAC bin when num_active>=2 (CABAC desync)
    - AMVP: isScaledFlagLX, B-candidate always-run, same-list-first ordering
    - Temporal MVP: collocated MV selection (NoBackwardPredFlag, col_from_l0_flag), per-list derivation, collocated frame ref_poc stored in DPB
    - Earlier: CBF tracking for deblocking bS=2, DST/DCT for inter 4x4 TUs, chroma MC shifts (4→6), skip/no-residual CU boundary marking, WPP entry point offsets + CABAC reinit, cu_skip_flag cross-CTB-row context derivation, deblocking TB/PB edge distinction with separate bS derivation, bi-pred cross-list bS comparison, bi-pred H+V MC rounding offset
  - IMPORTANT: dec265 reference YUV is in DISPLAY ORDER (not decode order)
  - Deblock trace infrastructure: `enable_deblock_trace()` dumps all edge parameters to /tmp/our_deblock_trace.txt
  - Multi-slice: PictureMaps persistence across slices (ct_depth, intra modes, pred/mv, cbf, qp, sao)
  - Loop filters deferred to picture completion (prevents intra ref corruption in multi-slice)
  - Tile scan order: boundary detection, CABAC reinit at tile boundaries with entry point offsets
  - Remaining UNINIT vectors: TILES_A/B (complex tile CABAC desync within tiles), DELTAQP_A (PCM + complex content), DBLK_A/B (multi-slice inter desync), SDH_A (cu_qp_delta desync), MVDL1ZERO (scattered inter desync)
  - Deferred: SIMD MC (Phase 7), weighted prediction application
- 4:4:4 chroma: decodes correctly (61.9dB). Color conversion now has an AVX2
  path (`convert_444_to_rgb`, 2026-06-01): x86 `to_rgb` 4.46ms→1.69ms (2.64x) on
  nokia_444. **aarch64 keeps scalar by measurement** (Hetzner Ampere Altra: the
  core's scalar auto-vectorization at 6.12ms beat both a naive 8px NEON, 12.1ms,
  and a 16px `vst3q`-interleaved NEON, 7.23ms), so the tier is `[v3, scalar]`.
  A NEON win likely needs i16-domain math or a stronger ARM core (Apple Silicon,
  untested here) — re-measure before adding a NEON 444 path. Bit-exact vs scalar
  on both arches (`convert_444_matches_scalar_reference`).
- Dependent slice segments: not supported (2 vectors fail)

## Known Bugs

### FIXED 2026-06-01: Lossless 4:4:4 transquant-bypass now decodes (bit-exact vs libheif)

`testdata/features/lossless.heic` (10-bit 4:4:4 `cu_transquant_bypass` intra-NxN,
matrix_coefficients=0 GBR) decodes bit-exact vs libheif. Found by diffing our
SE# trace (set `SE_TRACE_LIMIT` in ctu.rs > 0) against dec265's until 304/304
matched. Five fixes, in `src/hevc/ctu.rs` unless noted:
1. **4:4:4 cbf carve-out** — `cbf_cb`/`cbf_cr` read at the 4x4 leaf when
   `ChromaArrayType==3` (`log2_size > 2 || chroma_array_type == 3`).
2. **4:4:4 NxN chroma modes** — one `intra_chroma_pred_mode` per luma PB (4 for
   NxN) when `ChromaArrayType==3`, stored per-quadrant.
3. **transquant_bypass transform tree** — the intra residual tree is parsed even
   under bypass (bypass skips reconstruction, not the residual_coding syntax).
4. **chroma scan order (the final desync)** — the leaf looks up the per-quadrant
   chroma mode via `get_intra_chroma_mode_at`, not the single threaded mode;
   Angular 10/26 select vertical/horizontal scan, so the wrong mode picked
   diagonal and desynced CABAC inside the residual_coding.
5. **bypass reconstruction** — residual = parsed coeff levels directly (no
   dequant/transform); implicit RDPCM gated on the SPS `implicit_rdpcm` flag.
Supporting: `params.rs` now parses the full VUI tail + `hrd_parameters` +
`sps_range_extension` (the 9 RExt flags were never read; all false here, no-op
for non-RExt streams); `heic-core/frame.rs` handles `matrix_coefficients==0`
(R=Cr, G=Y, B=Cb) in both `to_rgb` and `ycbcr_to_rgb`. Pinned by
`tests/cov_features.rs::lossless_decodes_gradient`. No regression: example.heic,
nokia_444 (4:4:4 MAE 1.4), corpus, and 179 lib/integration tests unchanged.

### Negative-offset overlay: we are MORE spec-compliant than libheif (not a bug)

For an `iovl` tile placed at a negative offset (e.g. `testdata/features/iovl_negoff.heic`,
offset (-16,-16)), our decoder composites the tile's clipped on-canvas region per
ISO 23008-12 §6.6.2.3, and `tests/cov_features.rs::iovl_negative_offset_clips_tile`
asserts the spec-derived result. libheif 1.21.2 instead renders such overlays as
all-fill (skips the tile) and **fails Nokia conformance C021 entirely** (offset
(-640,-360), `heif-dec` rc=1). So the golden here is spec-derived, not

### FIXED 2026-05-31: Apple HDR gain map decoded ~95% UNINIT (monochrome CABAC desync)

The Apple HDR gain map (`apple-hdr/hdr-sample.heic`, a 768×432 **monochrome /
4:0:0** HEVC image) decoded ~95% UNINIT garbage (downconverting to 255) because
the 4:0:0 path read chroma syntax that isn't in the bitstream — each phantom
CABAC bin desynced the decode after a few CTBs. H.265 gates those syntax
elements on `ChromaArrayType != 0`; the decoder didn't. Fixed two sites in
`src/hevc/ctu.rs`:
- `cbf_cb`/`cbf_cr` (transform_tree, H.265 7.3.8.8): short-circuit to
  `(false,false)` when `ChromaArrayType == 0`.
- `intra_chroma_pred_mode` (`decode_intra_chroma_mode`, H.265 7.3.8.5): return
  the luma mode without reading when `ChromaArrayType == 0`.
Result: the gain map now decodes 0/331776 UNINIT. This unblocked the deferred
decode-completeness guard (re-added in `decode_nal_units`: error if any luma
sample stays UNINIT — verified safe against the full corpus). A stronger
`decode_apple_hdr_gain_map` test now asserts the 255-saturation fraction < 50%.
This was the first HEIC test asset with a monochrome stream, so the 4:0:0 path
had been unexercised. KNOWN GAP: H.265's `ChromaArrayType == 3` carve-out (4:4:4
reads cbf at the smallest TU) is still not implemented — 4:4:4 decodes at
61.9dB so it's masked/rare; fix if a 4:4:4 regression appears.

### Deep safety+code review — 2026-05-31 (43-agent workflow, adversarially verified)

Full fan-out review of all crates + native backends + CI. 81 findings, 29
verified-real, 2 refuted. Confirmed bugs below (file:line traced + an
independent verifier re-derived each from source). Pure-Rust items are
untrusted-input safety bugs reachable from a crafted .heic; native-backend
items are FFI/correctness bugs not runtime-verifiable on this Linux host.
Findings also logged to `~/work/feedback/heic.md`.

**FIX STATUS (2026-05-31) — all 29 confirmed findings addressed except 2 deferred:**
- ✅ FIXED + pushed to main: HEVC param/slice overflows (95d6eab); 10-bit
  limited-range color + NAL 32-bit wrap + crop saturating_sub (5be0203, 5f23346);
  stsc DoS + clap crop + iovl offset (4bf4f5e); zencodec grid limits (be7533e);
  VA-API ABI field order + offset asserts + unpack OOB + probe clamps (274db91);
  D3D11VA u32-trunc OOB (c840a02); native-FFI batch — MF chroma/leak/linear-unpack,
  VT chroma/crop/null, MediaCodec chroma/NV21/crop, D3D11VA multi-slice/0xFF-refpic
  (19a998c). Verification: pure-Rust by tests (heic-core color regression, corpus
  gate, overflow-checked corpus); native by cross-compile (windows-gnu / android /
  apple) — NOT runtime-verified (no Win/Android/Apple/GPU HW here). Runtime
  validation lands with the GPU/emulator CI (docs/CI.md).
- ⏳ DEFERRED (measure-first, not skipped):
  1. **UNINIT-sentinel leak** (cabac.rs:266 + frame.rs:444) — error-vs-clamp choice
     needs corpus-regression measurement (erroring on truncated streams could
     regress currently-passing corpus files). Sequence behind the conformance/corpus
     CI gate. NOTE: the color fix's `y_val.clamp(0, max_val)` already stops the raw
     0xFFFF leak in the 16-bit path.
  2. **dequant i32 overflow** (transform.rs:689,704; transform_simd.rs:1435,1449)
     for high-QP 10/12/16-bit — a correct fix widens the SIMD dequant kernel to i64;
     needs zenbench to confirm no 8/10-bit hot-path regression before landing. 8-bit
     (common case) does NOT overflow. Sequence behind a zenbench i64-vs-i32 dequant
     measurement.

**CI ADDED (2026-05-31):** corpus-decode gate over 95 bundled files (all 6 OSes +
i686 32-bit); overflow-checks job; semver/doc/av1/unci gates; 7 fuzz targets; MF
runtime fail-loud; MediaCodec emulator gate; VA-API/D3D11VA self-hosted GPU gates +
`examples/backend_decode`. Strategy + bounded-cost GPU plan: `docs/CI.md`.

**HIGH — pure-Rust untrusted-input (fixable + verifiable on Linux):**
- `src/codec.rs:1027,1112` — zencodec streaming grid decoder skips dim/memory
  limits when `Limits` not provided (parent's `try_decode_grid_streaming`
  uses `unwrap_or(&NO_LIMITS)`; the adapter does not). Crafted 32-bit-dims
  grid → uncapped alloc (64-bit OOM) / usize-overflow undersized buffer +
  OOB-index panic (wasm32). `strip_bytes` mul is unchecked. Fix: mirror
  `NO_LIMITS` default + `checked_mul`.
- `heic-core/src/frame.rs:1098-1122` — 10/12-bit **limited-range** YCbCr→RGB is
  ~4× too dark. Y-scale const `9576` is the 8-bit fixed-point scale but `shift`
  grows with bit depth without rescaling the coefficient. 10-bit white
  Y=940→RGB 256 not 1023. Corrupts every 10-bit limited-range image (iPhone
  HDR/BT.2020) through the 16-bit path. 8-bit + full-range branches correct,
  so 8-bit RGB tests never caught it. Fix: scale `9576` by `2^(bit_depth-8)`.
- `src/hevc/params.rs:1070-1072` — scaling-list DC coef `dc_coef_minus8 + 8`
  uses plain `+`; `read_se()` can return i32::MAX → overflow panic (debug /
  cargo-fuzz) or wrapped garbage DC (release wrong-pixels). Adjacent delta
  path already hardened with `wrapping_add`. Fix: reject per H.265 range
  [-7,247] or `wrapping_add`+`rem_euclid`.
- `src/hevc/params.rs:629-646` — SPS validates min/diff TB-size fields
  individually but not derived `log2_max_tb_size`. Craft min_tb=5 + diff=3 →
  log2_max_tb=8; an **inter** CU leaf at log2_size=6 bypasses intra's
  log2>5 guard → `coeffs[..4096]` slices the fixed `[i16;1024]` CoeffBuffer
  (`ctu.rs:2253/2258`) → OOB panic. Fix: reject `log2_max_tb_size > 5`.
- `src/decode.rs:2149-2188` + `src/hevc/transforms.rs` + `heic-core/src/frame.rs:416-418`
  — crafted `clap` clean-aperture inflates crop offsets unboundedly; a later
  `irot` swaps a huge offset into crop_right/bottom; `width - crop_right`
  u32 subtraction underflows → panic (debug) / OOB (release). Fix: clamp
  crop ≤ dims after clap+each transform AND `saturating_sub` the ~10
  `to_rgb*`/`to_bgr*` y_end/x_end sites. (verifier downgraded high→medium)
- `src/heif/parser.rs:2484-2491` — `resolve_sample_offset` inner loop upper
  bound `next_first_chunk` (attacker stsc field, up to u32::MAX) only
  validated `>= first_chunk`, not `<= num_chunks`. With `samples_per_chunk==0`
  the match never fires → up to ~4.3e9 useless iterations (measured 6.7s at
  5e8). Probe paths (`ImageInfo::from_bytes`, `extract_exif/xmp/icc`) pass
  `Unstoppable` so it's **uncancellable**. ~650-byte msf1 file. Fix: clamp
  `next_first_chunk.min(num_chunks+1)` + reject `samples_per_chunk==0`.

**HIGH — native FFI (fix by code-reading; runtime-verify needs the target OS):**
- `heic-backend-d3d11va/src/decoder.rs:508-520` — `(data.len() as u32) > buf_size`
  guard truncates on 64-bit; a >4 GiB bitstream whose low 32 bits < buf_size
  passes, then `copy_nonoverlapping(..,data.len())` overflows the GPU buffer
  (OOB write/UB). Same file uses safe `u32::try_from(..).unwrap_or(MAX)`
  elsewhere (lines 409,443). Fix: compare in usize before the cast.
- `heic-backend-vaapi/src/va_hevc.rs:84-134` — `VaPictureParameterBufferHevc`
  field order diverges from libva ABI: `slice_parsing_fields` placed right
  after `pic_fields` but libva puts it AFTER `row_height_minus1[21]`. Struct
  is `bytes_of`-memcpy'd into the driver buffer → every field from
  `sps_max_dec_pic_buffering_minus1` on is read 4 bytes off → garbage decode
  + plausible driver-side tile OOB. Total size still 604 so no size error;
  unit tests check field *values* not *offsets* (CLAUDE.md §1 anti-pattern).
  Confirmed via offset_of harness. Fix: reorder to match va_dec_hevc.h +
  add `const offset_of` layout asserts.
- `heic-backend-vaapi/src/decode.rs:593-672` — `unpack_planes` walks the mapped
  VAImage with loop bounds `config.width/height` + crop from `ispe`/SPS-conf
  (attacker, independent boxes) but the surface is sized from SPS coded dims.
  No check that `cy+h<=image.height` / offsets `<=data_size` → OOB read/UB
  when ispe > coded. Fix: validate against VAImage geometry, clamp.
- `heic-backend-mediafoundation/src/pixels.rs:57-74` — linear (non-IMF2DBuffer)
  fallback unpack does ZERO buffer-length validation (cur_len/max_len read but
  unused) before `from_raw_parts` over `coded_w*coded_h*3/2` → OOB if the MFT
  buffer is shorter. The 2D path guards this (pixels.rs:118-129); linear
  doesn't. (verifier: high→medium) Fix: share the 2D bounds check.

**Systemic native-backend bug — chroma mislabel (3 backends, all confirmed):**
- MF `imp.rs:408`, VT `imp.rs:594-663`, MediaCodec `imp.rs:457-463` — each
  hardcodes a 4:2:0 output buffer but tags `DecodedFrame.chroma_format` with
  the *source* `chroma_format_idc`. For 4:2:2/4:4:4 sources the parent
  (`src/decode.rs:634-664`, `frame.c_stride()`) reads chroma with the wrong
  stride/row-count → silent wrong pixels (guards turn would-be OOB into
  partial garbage reads). Fix: set `chroma_format=1` after decode, or reject
  non-4:2:0.
- MediaCodec `imp.rs:487-503` also unconditionally unpacks
  COLOR_FormatYUV420Flexible as NV12 → Cb/Cr swap (red/blue) on NV21/planar
  devices.

**MEDIUM (confirmed, abbreviated — see ~/work/feedback/heic.md for full):**
- `src/hevc/slice.rs:369-374` — long-term RPS `num_long_term_sps +
  num_long_term_pics` u32 sum overflow (two unbounded ue loops).
- `heic-core/src/nal.rs:40-44` — `hvcc_to_annexb` length-prefix bound check
  wraps on 32-bit → slice-index panic.
- `src/hevc/params.rs:883-895` — PPS num_tile_columns/rows_minus1 `as u16`
  truncation, no spec-bound validation; then `src/backend.rs:528-529` clamps
  to 255 (`unwrap_or(u8::MAX)`) into FFI pic-params → tile desync / OOB tile
  index in native backends.
- `src/decode.rs:609-631` — iovl negative per-image offsets clamped to 0
  instead of clipping off-canvas → wrong pixels (overlay_1000x680 13.1dB).
- `src/hevc/transform.rs:704` / `transform_simd.rs:1449` — i32 overflow in flat
  dequantize scalar path for 12/16-bit at high QP (partial).
- `src/hevc/cabac.rs:266-273` + `heic-core/src/frame.rs:444-447,718-723` —
  CABAC EOF tolerance lets a truncated bitstream "succeed" with
  `UNINIT_SAMPLE`(u16::MAX) CTBs; the sentinel passes through to_rgb/to_rgba
  (only final RGB clamp) → garbage pixels instead of a decode error.
- VT `imp.rs:583-667` — conformance-window crop / coded size ignored →
  spatially shifted pixels (top/left crop).
- MF `imp.rs:509-560` — pre-allocated IMFSample never Released on
  STREAM_CHANGE / NEED_MORE_INPUT / error retry → COM ref leak.
- MediaCodec `imp.rs:362-503` — crafted SPS-conf crop + mismatched ispe drives
  unpack index past the validated output-buffer size → panic.
- D3D11VA `imp.rs:130-165`+`decoder.rs:386-424` — single slice-control entry
  emitted for multi-slice/multi-NAL bitstream → wrong pixels.

**Refuted (NOT bugs — recorded so they're not re-investigated):**
- `heic-core/src/frame.rs:413` degenerate bit_depth<8 panic — native backends
  never produce bit_depth<8; not reachable from untrusted input.
- `src/decode.rs:1303,1948,2111,2404` unguarded luma/alpha/gainmap blits —
  dimensions validated upstream; the native-backend plane-size invariant holds.

### D3D11VA real-decode: example.heic midgray (not scaling lists; 2026-05-22)

Status: ⚠ Partial — 5 of 6 bundled corpus files (now including apple-hdr
near-bit-exact at max_delta=1) + 9/9 iPhone HDR fixtures decode on the
RTX 5070 via D3D11VA. One known failure:

- `tests/testdata/libheif-examples/example.heic` (1280×854, grid of
  6× 512×512 tiles, BT.709 limited): all 6 tiles return Y=128 /
  Cb=128 / Cr=128 midgray.

Root cause: NOT scaling lists. After adding scaling-list propagation
through `ParsedSps`/`ParsedPps` + `qmatrix_from_parsed()`,
apple-hdr/hdr-sample.heic dropped from max_delta=49 to max_delta=1
(near bit-exact). example.heic remains stuck at max_delta=255
midgray — i.e. the GPU isn't writing decoded pixels at all,
unrelated to scaling-list math.

Triage update (after commit `b16dcd28`): individual 512×512 tile
decodes for example.heic produce REAL CONTENT (debug dump:
y0=[180, 180, 180, ...] for tile 1, y0=[94, 93, ...] for tile 2,
y0=[153, 153, ...] for tile 3 — clearly varied photo content). So
the GRID-TILE decode path through D3D11VA is fully working.

The corpus_diff failure (max_delta=255 against rust output) comes
from a DIFFERENT decode call the parent makes for example.heic:
debug shows a 1280×854 "full image" decode with spsW=1280
spsH=856, nals=2, first_nal_type=39 (SEI prefix), and Y plane
showing y0=[16, 16, 16, ...] (BT.709 limited-range black).

That suggests example.heic contains BOTH a grid layout (6× 512×512
tiles) AND a separate single-image item (1280×856 coded → 1280×854
visible). The parent picks the single-image path for the actual
decode, and D3D11VA produces all-black on that specific bitstream.

Next session: hex-dump the FULL-IMAGE pic_params for the
example.heic 1280×854 decode (not the tile decodes) and find why
this bitstream specifically goes black. Different fix path than
the scaling-list one.

Reproduce: `HEIC_D3D11VA_HW=1 HEIC_D3D11VA_DEBUG=1 cargo test ...
d3d11va_vs_rust_corpus_diff` to see the full corpus output;
`d3d11va_vs_rust_synthetic_corpus` is the bit-exact subset gate.

## Investigation Notes

### UNINIT pixel triage (conformance vectors with negative PSNR)

10 vectors have UNINIT pixels (max_diff=65535 = UNINIT_SAMPLE sentinel).

**Vectors analyzed:**
- TILES_A/B: tiles_enabled=1 (5x5 non-uniform tiles), I-slices only. Tile CABAC reinit implemented.
- DELTAQP_A: cu_qp_delta_enabled=1, multi-slice (5 slices per I-frame). All frames UNINIT including frame 0 (I-frame).
- SDH_A: single-slice I+B. I-frame has 34% UNINIT, B-frame has 99% UNINIT.
- SAO_B: tiles=1 (3x1), B-slices
- RQT_A: FIXED — was missing interSplitFlag (H.265 7.3.8.7). Now 23.9dB (CABAC bit-exact, remaining diffs from deblock/SAO).
- CONFWIN_A: single-slice P/B. I-frame ~12dB (no UNINIT), later P/B frames get UNINIT.
- DBLK_A/B: multi-slice (4 slices per frame). ~12dB all frames, some have UNINIT.
- MVDL1ZERO_A: multi-slice, 500-frame sequence. Most frames ~12dB, 3 have UNINIT.

**Root cause analysis:**
- The dec265 CTU-CK checksum trace is ONLY printed for non-I slices (gated by `slice_type != I`), so earlier byte-position comparisons were between different frame types.
- MERGE_A (pixel-exact) has `cu_qp_delta_enabled=0`, `transform_skip_enabled=1`, QP=32.
- Failing I-frames (DELTAQP_A, SDH_A) have `cu_qp_delta_enabled=1` or different QP.
- The CABAC init formula and context tables match libde265 for the contexts checked (split_cu_flag, SAO, CBF).
- The CABAC engine init (range=510, value from first 2 bytes) matches libde265.
- Data offset computation verified correct for DELTAQP_A IDR slice (1 byte header → data_offset=1).
- First bin (split_cu_flag) verified manually: state=0,mps=0 at QP=26, LPS range=240, MPS threshold=34560, value=28334 → MPS (no split). This matches expected behavior for a flat-content first CTB.
- The UNINIT pixels are genuine (u16::MAX in Y plane), meaning some CTBs' pixels are never written. The decoder doesn't error out.

**Hypothesis:** The UNINIT appears to be from B/P frames referencing corrupted reference frames, not from I-frame decode failures. The I-frame first CTU decodes correctly (verified via SE trace). Need to compare more CTUs to find where decode diverges.

**Infrastructure built:**
- `PictureMaps` for cross-slice map persistence (ctu.rs)
- Deferred loop filter application in `finish_current_picture` (mod.rs)
- Tile boundary detection with CABAC reinit (ctu.rs)
- `compute_tile_boundaries`, `build_tile_scan_order`, `get_tile_id` helpers
