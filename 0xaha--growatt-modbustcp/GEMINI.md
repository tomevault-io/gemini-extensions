## 🛑 RULES THAT PREVENT REAL BUGS

Every rule below exists because it was broken and something shipped wrong. The examples are
real, not hypothetical. Read this before the sensor checklist.

### 1. Check the protocol documents before inferring anything

We have ~2.5 MB of Growatt protocol documentation in `Protocols/` and a 105 KB extracted
reference in `docs/developer/protocol-v139.md`. **Search it first.** Grep the register
number. It takes seconds.

Register meanings were argued across GitHub threads for a week, twice wrongly, while the
answers were already checked in:

- Battery SOH was reported to a user as register 31218 (VPP range) and possibly
  unobtainable. It is **1096**, documented as `BMS_SOH` under "BMS information 1082-1124".
- Registers 1021/1037 were disputed for days. The doc states plainly: `1021 PactouserTotal`
  (grid import), `1037 PLocalLoad total` (house load).

A profile's `desc` string, a code comment, and a model's marketing name are **not
evidence**. The protocol document and a field scan are.

### 2. Input and holding registers overlap — always state the function code

The same address means different things in each space. This has caused three separate
errors:

| Address | Holding (FC03) | Input (FC04) |
|---|---|---|
| 43 | DTC / device type code | `Iac2` phase 2 current |
| 1083-1088 | Grid First time periods | BMS status / SOC / voltage / current / temp |
| 1100-1108 | Battery First time slots | BMS gauge and version data |

Reading input 43 and concluding a device reports no DTC — when the DTC lives in holding 43
— is a mistake that has been made *while warning someone else about the same trap*. When
you cite a register, say which space it is in.

### 3. "Read OK" and "responds" do not mean "works"

A register answering with `0` reports as **Read OK**. That is evidence the address
responds, never that the value is meaningful or that writes take effect.

Registers 1071/1091 survived three contradicting field reports because an old scan showed
"all Read OK". They accept writes and silently ignore them.

### 4. Absence of evidence needs the evidence to have been possible

Before concluding a register is empty or absent, confirm the scan actually covered it.
A v0.7.7 scan was used to prove a device reports no DTC — that scanner version never read
the legacy holding range at all. A missing range in a scan is not a missing value.

### 5. Verify the whole chain, not the half you are thinking about

Three releases needed follow-ups this week, all the same shape:

- v1.2.0: the read path consumed the block-size option correctly, and the form could never
  save it. Verified the consumer, not the producer.
- v1.3.5: fixed the option format, updated one of two fetch paths. The other raised
  `ValueError` on every poll.
- v1.4.0: removed a register so its sensor would disappear. The sensor platform recreated
  it from the profile's sensor set and it reported `0.0`.

**When you change a stored format, grep every consumer. When you remove data, check what
recreates it.**

### 6. `hasattr()` gates only work on dynamic attributes

`condition: lambda data: hasattr(data, 'x')` reads as "only if the profile provides x". It
is a no-op when `x` is a `GrowattData` dataclass field, because the field always exists
with a default — the sensor is created regardless and publishes the default, typically a
plausible-looking `0`.

It works only for attributes assigned dynamically via `setattr()` (the BMS block, for
example). 31 conditions in `sensor.py` are decorative; `tests/test_sensor_conditions.py`
enumerates them and fails if a new one appears. To exclude a sensor for real, remove it
from the profile's **sensor set** — that is the only hard filter.

### 7. Never write file content through PowerShell

Use the **Edit** and **Write** tools. `Set-Content -Encoding utf8` writes a BOM in PS 5.1,
which broke `manifest.json` and would have stopped the integration loading. Em-dashes have
been mangled into `â€"` in three separate files this way.

Prefer plain ASCII in commit messages and shell-adjacent content — hyphens rather than
em-dashes, straight quotes rather than curly. Non-ASCII in source files is fine *via the
editing tools*, never via a shell redirect.

**This matters more than it looks: `docs/` is published to GitHub Pages.** A file written
with the wrong encoding does not just look odd in an editor — it renders as visible
mojibake to every reader of the documentation site. The character is never the problem;
the encoding is. Banning em-dashes would treat the symptom and still leave curly quotes,
degree signs, arrows and accented names to break the same way.

Check before committing anything written outside the editing tools:

```bash
# BOM (breaks JSON parsing, renders as a stray glyph in Markdown)
python -c "print(open('FILE','rb').read()[:3] == b'\xef\xbb\xbf')"
```

Then grep for `â€`, `Ã¢`, `Â` — the signatures of UTF-8 read as Windows-1252.

Also: `Get-Content -Raw` misreads UTF-8 and will show you mojibake that is not in the file.
Verify encoding claims with `Grep` or Python, not PowerShell.

### 8. Duplicate dict keys are invisible after import

Python silently keeps the last one. `tl_xh.py` defined register `3136` twice; the
temperature mapping never existed at runtime — no sensor, no error, nothing to notice.
Loaded `REGISTER_MAPS` cannot show this. `tests/test_profile_integrity.py` parses the
profile sources with `ast` to catch it.

### 9. Prove a new test fails without the fix

Disable the fix, run the test, confirm it goes red, restore. Assertions written alongside a
fix inherit its blind spots — a block-size test asserted `resolve_block_size(stored) == 25`,
which called the helper on its own output and passed throughout the regression it was
meant to catch.

### 10. Read every comment on an issue before assessing it

Fetching the last 3 of 16 comments has twice produced an "assessment" that missed the
decisive measurement. The comment count is in the same API response — check it. A
maintainer asking "are there new comments?" should never be how a five-comment exchange
gets discovered.

### 11. Two readings agreeing proves nothing; diverging proves independence

Two registers matching at one moment can be coincidence. Two registers diverging at any
moment is proof they are separate sources. Only the second direction is conclusive.

Register 3176 was reported as a duplicate of register 93 after both read `545` in one scan.
A paired reading at a different operating point refuted it. **Always ask for a second
sample at a different operating point before remapping a register.**

### 12. A user-facing change isn't done until the docs say so

`docs/` is published to GitHub Pages and is where users go before they open an issue.
Nothing fails when it goes stale — no test, no build error, no warning — so it drifts
silently while every other check stays green.

The costly case is a feature that removes work for users. Ship a diagnostic that collects
information automatically and the page still telling people to gather it by hand doesn't
break; it just wastes their time indefinitely, and yours re-asking for what the tool
already produces.

Before calling a change complete, ask which page would now be wrong:

| Change | Page to check |
|---|---|
| New diagnostic, service or scanner range | `troubleshooting/diagnostic-service.md`, `troubleshooting/raising-an-issue.md` |
| New repair issue or user-visible warning | `troubleshooting/raising-an-issue.md` |
| DTC or profile mapping | `troubleshooting/dtc-debugging.md`, `developer/protocol-vpp.md` — **both**, and they are test-enforced |
| Register meaning or scale | the relevant `developer/protocol-*.md` |
| New sensor or control | `controls/entity-reference.md` |
| New supported model | `hardware/models.md`, `hardware/autodetection.md` |
| Gateway or adapter finding | `troubleshooting/rs485-gateways.md` |

**Prefer linking to a canonical source over copying it.** A page that restates something
maintained elsewhere — release notes, a register table, a version number — is a second copy
that has to be kept in step by hand, and it never is. Link to the source, or generate the
page from it. Only duplicate when the copy is genuinely for a different audience, and then
add a test that holds the two together.

Two things that make this fail quietly:

- **A new page must be added to `mkdocs.yml` nav.** The build succeeds without it, so
  nothing complains — the page is simply unreachable from the site navigation.
- **The docs workflow only runs on `docs/**` and `mkdocs.yml` changes.** A release note
  linking a doc page can go out before that page deploys, if the two land in separate
  pushes.

### 13. Mark a mapping CONFIRMED only with a citable device report

`DTC_REGISTRY` in `auto_detection.py` records `CONFIRMED` or `ASSUMED` plus evidence.
CONFIRMED means a real device on that DTC was seen running that profile, traceable to an
issue number or scan. Anything else is ASSUMED and says so in the log and the scanner.

## 🚨 START HERE - Adding/Updating Sensors 🚨

**BEFORE making ANY changes to sensors or registers:**

### 1. **Required Checklist** (Complete ALL 7 steps)
```
□ Step 1: Update profile file (profiles/*.py) - Add register definition
□ Step 2: Add to GrowattData dataclass (growatt_modbus.py) - Add field
□ Step 3: Add sensor definition (sensor.py) - SENSOR_DEFINITIONS
□ Step 4: Assign device type (const.py) - SENSOR_DEVICE_MAP
□ Step 5: Add to sensor group (device_profiles.py) - BATTERY_SENSORS/GRID_SENSORS/etc
□ Step 6: Name it (strings.json AND translations/en.json) - entity.sensor.<key>.name
□ Step 7: Run validation script: python3 validate_sensors.py --sensor <name>
```

**Step 6 was missing from this list until #403 shipped two unnamed sensors.** Home Assistant
does not fall back to `SENSOR_DEFINITIONS['name']` — an entity with no `entity.sensor` entry
exists, reads correctly, and displays with no name of its own, showing only the device name.
Nothing local caught it: the check lives in `tests_ha/`, which needs Home Assistant and only
runs in CI.

**Removing a sensor is not the reverse of this list.** Deleting the register is not enough:
the sensor platform creates whatever the profile's **sensor set** lists, and a
`hasattr()` condition cannot stop it if the attribute is a dataclass field (rule 6). Remove
it from the sensor set, and clear any already-registered entity in `__init__.py` — that
cleanup must not be gated on the inverter being connected, because `coordinator.data` is an
empty placeholder during setup (rule 5).

### 2. **Validation Tools**
```bash
# Validate a specific sensor
python3 validate_sensors.py --sensor battery_power

# Validate all sensors
python3 validate_sensors.py

# Validate entire profile
python3 validate_sensors.py --profile sph
```

### 3. **Quick Search Check**
```bash
# After making changes, verify sensor appears in all places:
grep -r "your_sensor_name" custom_components/growatt_modbus/
```

**If ANY step is skipped, the sensor WILL NOT work correctly!**

### Device Hierarchy

The integration uses a **multi-device structure** where entities are logically grouped:

```
Inverter (parent device)
├── Solar Device       - PV inputs, AC output, solar energy
├── Grid Device        - Grid import/export, grid power flow
├── Load Device        - Consumption, load power, AC output voltage
└── Battery Device     - Battery storage, charge/discharge
```

**Why this matters:** When adding sensors, you MUST assign them to the correct device type or they'll appear in the wrong location in Home Assistant.

## Register Update/Addition Process

### ⚠️ CRITICAL CHECKLIST - Follow Every Time

When adding or updating a register in a profile, you MUST complete ALL these steps:

#### Step 1: Update Profile File (`profiles/*.py`)

**Location:** `custom_components/growatt_modbus/profiles/<profile>.py`

Add the register definition:

```python
'input_registers': {
    20: {'name': 'grid_voltage', 'scale': 0.1, 'unit': 'V', 'desc': 'AC input voltage'},
}
```

**Important considerations:**
- Choose the correct register name (see [Naming Conventions](#register-naming-conventions))
- Set correct `scale` factor
- For 32-bit values, define both `_high` and `_low` with `pair` attribute
- Mark signed values with `'signed': True`

#### Step 2: Add to GrowattData Dataclass (`growatt_modbus.py`)

**Location:** `custom_components/growatt_modbus/growatt_modbus.py` (~lines 60-180)

Add the field to the `@dataclass` definition:

```python
@dataclass
class GrowattData:
    """Container for Growatt inverter data"""
    # ... existing fields ...

    # SPF Off-Grid AC Input (from grid/generator)
    grid_voltage: float = 0.0         # V (AC input voltage)
    grid_frequency: float = 0.0       # Hz (AC input frequency)
```

**⚠️ CRITICAL:** This step is often forgotten but is REQUIRED! Without this field:
- The code will try to set `data.grid_voltage = value`
- But `hasattr(data, 'grid_voltage')` returns `False`
- Sensor conditions fail and sensor doesn't appear

**Type Guidelines:**
- `float = 0.0` - For all sensor values (voltage, current, power, energy, temperature, percentages)
- `int = 0` - For status codes, counts, or control registers
- `str = ""` - For text fields (firmware version, serial number)

**Organization:**
- Group related fields together with comment headers
- Place near similar sensors (battery fields together, PV fields together, etc.)
- See existing dataclass structure for examples

#### Step 3: Add Sensor Definition (`sensor.py`)

**Location:** `custom_components/growatt_modbus/sensor.py`

Add to `SENSOR_DEFINITIONS` dictionary (~line 40-700):

```python
"grid_voltage": {
    "name": "Grid Voltage",
    "icon": "mdi:transmission-tower",
    "device_class": SensorDeviceClass.VOLTAGE,
    "state_class": SensorStateClass.MEASUREMENT,
    "unit": UnitOfElectricPotential.VOLT,
    "attr": "grid_voltage",  # Must match register name
},
```

**Required fields:**
- `name` - Display name in Home Assistant
- `icon` - MDI icon (browse at https://materialdesignicons.com/)
- `device_class` - HA device class (VOLTAGE, POWER, ENERGY, etc.)
- `state_class` - Usually `MEASUREMENT` for sensors
- `unit` - Unit constant from `homeassistant.const`
- `attr` - Data attribute name (must match register `name` in profile)

**Optional fields:**
- `condition` - Lambda function to conditionally create sensor
- `entity_category` - Set to `EntityCategory.DIAGNOSTIC` for technical sensors

#### Step 4: Assign Device Type (`const.py`)

**Location:** `custom_components/growatt_modbus/const.py` (~line 416-488)

Add the sensor key to the appropriate device's set in `SENSOR_DEVICE_MAP`:

```python
SENSOR_DEVICE_MAP = {
    DEVICE_TYPE_GRID: {
        'grid_power', 'grid_export_power',
        'grid_voltage',  # ← Add here
        ...
    },
}
```

**Device assignment guidelines:**
- `DEVICE_TYPE_SOLAR` - PV inputs, solar production, AC output current/power
- `DEVICE_TYPE_GRID` - Grid connection, import/export, grid voltage/frequency
- `DEVICE_TYPE_LOAD` - Consumption, load power, AC output voltage (for SPF)
- `DEVICE_TYPE_BATTERY` - Battery storage, SOC, charge/discharge
- `DEVICE_TYPE_INVERTER` - Status, faults, temperatures, system info

#### Step 5: Add to Sensor Group (`device_profiles.py`)

**Location:** `custom_components/growatt_modbus/device_profiles.py` (Lines 5-110)

Add the sensor key to the appropriate sensor group set:

```python
BATTERY_SENSORS: Set[str] = {
    "battery_voltage", "battery_current", "battery_soc",
    "battery_temp", "battery_power",
    "new_battery_sensor",  # ← Add here
    ...
}

GRID_SENSORS: Set[str] = {
    "grid_power", "grid_export_power",
    "grid_voltage",  # ← Or add here if it's a grid sensor
    ...
}
```

**Available sensor groups:**
- `BASIC_PV_SENSORS` - PV string sensors (voltage, current, power)
- `BASIC_AC_SENSORS` - AC output sensors
- `BATTERY_SENSORS` - Battery related sensors
- `GRID_SENSORS` - Grid import/export sensors
- `ENERGY_SENSORS` - Energy production sensors
- `TEMPERATURE_SENSORS` - Temperature sensors
- `STATUS_SENSORS` - Status and diagnostic sensors
- `THREE_PHASE_SENSORS` - Three-phase AC sensors
- `SPF_OFFGRID_SENSORS` - Off-grid specific sensors

**Why this matters:** Profiles in `INVERTER_PROFILES` compose these sensor groups (e.g., `sensors: BASIC_PV_SENSORS | BATTERY_SENSORS`). If the sensor isn't in the right group, it won't be included in any profile.

#### Step 6: Name the Sensor (`strings.json` **and** `translations/en.json`)

**Location:** `custom_components/growatt_modbus/strings.json` and
`custom_components/growatt_modbus/translations/en.json` — both files, same content.

Sensor names are served from the translation files, not from the Python definition:

```json
"entity": {
  "sensor": {
    "battery_remaining_capacity": { "name": "Battery Remaining Capacity" }
  }
}
```

The `name` must match `SENSOR_DEFINITIONS[key]["name"]` exactly — `tests_ha/` asserts they
agree, so that the English text and the 22 shipped translations cannot drift apart.

**Why this is easy to miss:** skipping it breaks nothing that any local check can see. The
entity is created, polls, records history and works. It simply has no label — Home Assistant
shows the device name alone, with no fallback to the Python `name`. `validate_sensors.py` now
covers this; it did not when two sensors shipped unnamed in #403.

To check every sensor at once without Home Assistant installed:

```bash
python3 validate_sensors.py            # includes the translation check
```

#### Step 7: Validate Across Project

**Run the validation script (REQUIRED):**
```bash
python3 validate_sensors.py --sensor your_sensor_name
```

This will automatically check:
- ✅ Register defined in profile
- ✅ Added to sensor.py SENSOR_DEFINITIONS
- ✅ Added to const.py SENSOR_DEVICE_MAP
- ✅ Added to profile 'sensors' set
- ✅ Named in strings.json and translations/en.json, with matching text

**Additional manual checks:**

1. **Search for similar register names** to ensure consistency:
   ```bash
   grep -r "grid_voltage" custom_components/growatt_modbus/
   ```

2. **Verify no naming conflicts** in the profile:
   ```bash
   grep "'name': 'grid_voltage'" profiles/*.py
   ```

3. **Check if register needs special handling** in coordinator.py:
   - Signed value conversion?
   - Inversion (like battery power for SPF)?
   - Fallback logic (like battery voltage)?

4. **Update tests** (if applicable)

## Profile Management

### When to Create a New Profile

**Create a new profile when:**
- Inverter uses a different register range (e.g., 0-124 vs 3000-3124)
- Register addresses overlap but have different meanings
- Significantly different capabilities (e.g., battery vs no battery)

**Extend existing profile when:**
- Only adding optional sensors (e.g., PV3 for 3-string models)
- Different power ratings but same register map
- Minor firmware variations

### Profile Inheritance

Profiles can inherit from others using Python's `**` operator:

```python
SPH_8000_10000_HU = {
    'name': 'SPH/SPM 8000-10000TL-HU',
    'input_registers': {
        # Inherit base registers
        **SPH_7000_10000['input_registers'],

        # Add/override specific registers
        1086: {'name': 'bms_soc', 'scale': 1, 'unit': '%'},
    },
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Reduces code duplication
- Makes differences explicit
- Easier to maintain

**Risks:**
- Changes to base profile affect all children
- Must verify overrides don't break inheritance

### Protocol Versions

The integration supports two protocol families:

1. **Legacy Protocol** - Older models, 0-124 register range
2. **VPP V2.01** - Newer models, 31000+ registers, DTC codes

**Auto-detection logic:**
1. Try to read DTC code (register 30000)
2. If present, use DTC-to-profile mapping
3. If not, use legacy detection (PV voltage, range checks)

**When adding profiles:**
- Determine protocol version first
- Set `'offgrid_protocol': True` for SPF (prevents VPP register access)
- Use appropriate register ranges

---

## Critical Patterns & Conventions

### Register Naming Conventions

Register names are critical because they control fallback behavior:

#### Standard Names (Enable Fallback)
```python
'battery_voltage'          # Coordinator searches for this exact name
'battery_soc'              # Falls back through: soc → battery_soc
'battery_power_low'        # Falls back to: charge_power_low / discharge_power_low
```

#### Suffixed Names (Prevent Fallback)
```python
'battery_voltage_legacy'   # Coordinator won't find "battery_voltage"
'battery_soc_vpp'          # Coordinator won't find "battery_soc"
'battery_power_vpp_low'    # Coordinator won't find "battery_power_low"
```

**Use case for suffixes:**
When multiple register ranges have the same logical sensor but only one works:

```python
# MOD profile - VPP range doesn't respond, 3000+ range does
31200: {'name': 'battery_power_vpp_high', ...},  # Won't be found
31201: {'name': 'battery_power_vpp_low', ...},   # Won't be found
3178: {'name': 'battery_charge_power_high', ...}, # Will be found ✓
3179: {'name': 'battery_charge_power_low', ...},  # Will be found ✓
```

### 32-bit Paired Registers

Many registers are 32-bit values split across two 16-bit registers:

```python
77: {
    'name': 'battery_power_high',
    'scale': 1,
    'unit': '',
    'pair': 78,  # Points to low word
    'signed': True,
    'desc': 'Battery power (HIGH word)'
},
78: {
    'name': 'battery_power_low',
    'scale': 1,
    'unit': '',
    'pair': 77,  # Points to high word
    'combined_scale': 0.1,  # Scale after combining
    'combined_unit': 'W',   # Unit after combining
    'signed': True,
    'desc': 'Battery power (LOW word)'
},
```

**Key points:**
- Both registers must have `'pair'` pointing to each other
- The `_low` register typically has `combined_scale` and `combined_unit`
- Combined value = `(high << 16) | low`
- Apply `signed` conversion BEFORE scaling

### Sign Conventions

#### Standard Convention (VPP 2.01, Most Models)
```
Battery Power:
  Positive = Charging
  Negative = Discharging

Grid Power:
  Positive = Exporting to grid
  Negative = Importing from grid
```

#### SPF Exception (Off-Grid Inverters)
SPF uses **inverted convention** for battery power:
```
Battery Power (Hardware):
  Positive = Discharging  ❌
  Negative = Charging     ❌
```

**Solution:** Use negative scale to flip:
```python
78: {
    'name': 'battery_power_low',
    'combined_scale': -0.1,  # Negative scale inverts sign
    'signed': True,
}
```

**Why this matters:** Home Assistant and energy dashboards expect standard convention. SPF is the only exception.

### Device-Specific Scales

Some registers have different scales depending on the device:

```python
# SPF: Battery voltage uses 0.01 scale for precision
17: {'name': 'battery_voltage', 'scale': 0.01, 'unit': 'V'},

# SPH: Battery voltage uses 0.1 scale
13: {'name': 'battery_voltage', 'scale': 0.1, 'unit': 'V'},
```

**Always verify scale** by checking:
1. Official Modbus documentation
2. Actual register values vs expected values
3. Other similar models

---

## Testing & Validation

### Pre-Commit Validation

Before committing changes:

1. **Check syntax:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m py_compile custom_components/growatt_modbus/profiles/*.py
   python3 -m py_compile custom_components/growatt_modbus/*.py
   ```

2. **Search for register name** across project:
   ```bash
   grep -r "register_name" custom_components/
   ```

3. **Verify sensor appears in all required locations:**
   - Profile `'input_registers'` or `'holding_registers'`
   - Profile `'sensors'` set
   - `sensor.py` `SENSOR_DEFINITIONS`
   - `const.py` `SENSOR_DEVICE_MAP`

4. **Check for naming conflicts:**
   ```bash
   grep -E "^    [0-9]+:" profiles/sph.py | grep "register_address"
   ```

### Testing New Profiles

When adding a new profile:

1. **Test auto-detection** (if applicable):
   - Add DTC code to `auto_detection.py` DTC_MAP
   - Add refinement logic if needed (e.g., storage range check)
   - Test with diagnostic scanner

2. **Verify register readings:**
   - Use diagnostic service `growatt_modbus.read_register`
   - Check raw values match expected with correct scale
   - Verify 32-bit combined values

3. **Test with actual hardware** (if possible):
   - Use Universal Scanner diagnostic service
   - Verify all sensors appear
   - Check values are reasonable

4. **Document in release notes:**
   - Add profile to supported models list
   - Note any special considerations
   - Include known limitations

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Sensor Not Appearing

**Symptoms:** Register defined in profile, but sensor doesn't appear in HA. Logs show "condition not met".

**Checklist:**
- ✅ Added field to `GrowattData` dataclass in `growatt_modbus.py`? **← Most common issue!**
- ✅ Added to appropriate sensor group in `device_profiles.py`?
- ✅ Added to `sensor.py` `SENSOR_DEFINITIONS`?
- ✅ Added to `const.py` `SENSOR_DEVICE_MAP`?
- ✅ `attr` in sensor definition matches register `name` AND dataclass field name?
- ✅ Condition in sensor definition evaluates to true?

**Common cause:** Field missing from `GrowattData` dataclass → `hasattr(data, 'field_name')` returns False → condition fails

### Issue 2: Wrong Device Assignment

**Symptoms:** Sensor appears in wrong device (e.g., battery sensor in solar device)

**Solution:** Update `const.py` `SENSOR_DEVICE_MAP` to assign sensor to correct device type.

### Issue 3: Incorrect Values

**Symptoms:** Sensor shows wrong value (too high, too low, negative when should be positive)

**Common causes:**
1. **Wrong scale** - Check register documentation
2. **Missing signed flag** - Add `'signed': True` for signed registers
3. **Incorrect paired register** - Verify high/low word order
4. **Wrong combined_scale** - Check which register has combined_scale
5. **SPF sign inversion** - Use negative scale for battery_power

### Issue 4: Fallback Not Working

**Symptoms:** Sensor shows 0 or unavailable when fallback register has data

**Cause:** Register name includes suffix that blocks fallback

**Example:**
```python
# BAD - Won't fallback
31201: {'name': 'battery_power_vpp_low', ...},  # Coordinator looks for battery_power_low

# GOOD - Will fallback
31201: {'name': 'battery_power_low', ...},       # Coordinator finds it
```

**Solution:** Use standard names for registers that should participate in fallback, use suffixed names for registers that shouldn't.

### Issue 5: Profile Detection Fails

**Symptoms:** Auto-detection picks wrong profile

**Common causes:**
1. **DTC code not in mapping** - Add to `auto_detection.py`
2. **Refinement logic wrong** - Check range detection (storage, 3000+)
3. **Detection order wrong** - Storage range should be checked before PV3

**Solution:** Update `auto_detection.py` with correct logic:
```python
# CORRECT ORDER for SPH detection:
1. Check storage range (1000-1124) → SPH HU
2. Check PV3 voltage → SPH 7-10kW
3. No PV3 → SPH 3-6kW
```

### Issue 6: Breaking Existing Profiles

**Symptoms:** Update to one profile breaks others that inherit from it

**Prevention:**
1. **Check inheritance chains** before modifying base profiles
2. **Use overrides** instead of modifying shared definitions
3. **Test all child profiles** after base changes

**Solution:**
```python
# Don't modify base
BASE_PROFILE = {
    1044: {'name': 'priority_mode', 'scale': 1, ...}
}

# Override in child instead
CHILD_PROFILE = {
    **BASE_PROFILE,
    1044: {'name': 'priority', 'scale': 1, ...}  # Override
}
```

### Issue 7: MIC Micro Inverter Detection Failures

**Symptoms:** MIC 1000TL-X or other micro inverters (600W-3.3kW) detected as MIN 3000-6000TL-X or communication failures

**Common causes:**
1. **Wrong detection order** - Auto-detection checked MIN (3000+ range) before MIC (0-179 range)
2. **Serial/RTU converter misconfiguration** - Wrong timing or framing settings
3. **Model name not recognized** - Model string doesn't match patterns

**Solution 1: Verify correct profile selected**
- MIC uses 0-179 register range (legacy V3.05 protocol, 2013)
- MIN uses 3000+ register range (V1.39 protocol)
- These are completely different protocols - MIN profile won't work on MIC!

**Solution 2: Check serial/RTU converter settings (USR-DR164, etc.)**

For Modbus RTU over serial at 9600 baud:

```yaml
Required Settings:
- Baud Rate: 9600
- Data Bits: 8
- Parity: None
- Stop Bits: 1  ← NOT "CTSRTS" or "2"!
- Pack Interval: 50-100ms  ← NOT 20ms!

Common Mistakes:
❌ Stop Bit = "CTSRTS" → Hardware flow control not supported
❌ Pack Interval = 20ms → Too short for inverter processing
✅ Stop Bit = "1" → Standard Modbus framing
✅ Pack Interval = 50-100ms → Safe timing for 9600 baud
```

**Why timing matters for MIC:**
- Frame transmission at 9600 baud: ~10ms (8-10 bytes)
- MIC inverter processing time: 50-100ms (legacy protocol may be slower)
- Total round-trip: 100-150ms minimum
- Pack interval too short (20ms) cuts off inverter responses

**Frame timing calculation:**
```
At 9600 baud with 8N1:
- 1 bit time: 104 μs
- 1 byte (8+1+1): 1.04 ms
- Modbus read 1 register: ~8-10 bytes → 10ms transmission
- Inverter processing: 50-100ms
- Safe interval: 50-100ms between requests
```

**Solution 3: Manual profile selection**
If auto-detection fails, manually select correct profile:
- Navigate to: Settings → Devices & Services → Growatt Modbus → Configure
- Select: "MIC (0.6-3.3kW)" from dropdown
- Verify sensors: ~15-20 sensors (not 40+ like MIN)

**Expected MIC sensors:**
- PV1 voltage/current/power (single string only)
- AC voltage/current/power/frequency
- Energy today/total
- Inverter/IPM temperature
- Status/fault codes
- NO Grid sensors (MIC doesn't have grid monitoring)
- NO PV2/PV3 sensors (MIC is single string only)

**MIC model patterns recognized:**
```python
'MIC600', 'MIC750', 'MIC1000', 'MIC1500',
'MIC2000', 'MIC2500', 'MIC3000', 'MIC3300'
→ All map to: mic_600_3300tl_x
```

**Detection order (fixed in v0.2.7):**
```
1. Check OffGrid DTC (SPF prevention)
2. Check VPP DTC (register 30000)
3. Check model name
4. Check MIC range (0-179) ← NOW BEFORE MIN
5. Check MIN range (3000+)
6. Check SPH range (battery)
7. Check 3-phase (MOD/MID)
```

## Version Bumping Checklist

When preparing a release:

1. **Update the version in `manifest.json`.** That is the only place it is typed.

   The badges in `README.md` and `docs/index.md` track the latest GitHub release through
   shields.io, so they update themselves when a release is published — and they skip
   pre-releases, so the site always advertises the newest version a visitor can actually
   install.

   **Do not replace them with a static badge.** `tests/test_docs_versioning.py` fails if
   one reappears: a typed-in badge is correct for exactly one release and silently wrong
   from then on.

2. **Update documentation:**
   - `RELEASENOTES.md` - Add new version section
   - Document all fixes and new features
   - Include upgrade notes if needed

   **Keep entries to short bullets.** One or two sentences each: what changed, and what a
   user has to do or expect. A bullet that runs to four paragraphs is a commit message in
   the wrong file — the reasoning, the measurements and the history belong in the commit
   and the code comments, where the next maintainer will look for them.

   **Do not narrate whose fault it was.** No "introduced by us in vX.Y.Z", no "the same
   bug that release was fixing", no post-mortem of how it got shipped. State the fix and
   who it affects. Users need to know whether it touches them; they do not need the
   confession, and it crowds out the part they came for.

   Still include, because these are user-facing facts rather than blame:
   - which models or profiles a change applies to
   - entities that will appear or disappear on upgrade
   - anything the user must do (re-select an option, re-run a scan)
   - credit to the reporter — that is thanks, not fault
   - whether a mapping is confirmed on hardware or taken from the protocol

3. **Commit with proper message:**
   ```
   Bump version to vX.Y.Z

   - Feature 1 description
   - Fix 1 description
   - Update 1 description
   ```

4. **Test before release:**
   - Verify import in Home Assistant
   - Check all changed sensors work
   - Test with at least one real device if possible

### Release cadence

**Pre-release by default.** `gh release create vX.Y.Z --prerelease` keeps the previous
stable marked Latest, so HACS does not offer it unless the user opted into betas. Promote
to stable once a reporter confirms, or batch weekly.

**One exception — ship stable immediately when we broke it.** A regression that takes
entities offline, corrupts data, or publishes a wrong-but-plausible value cannot wait for
a weekly batch, and a pre-release does not reach the people already affected. v1.3.6 and
v1.4.1 both qualified.

Pre-release convention: bump `manifest.json`, but leave the README badge at the last
**stable** version.

### Pulling a release

If a release must be withdrawn:

```bash
gh release edit vX.Y.Z --draft      # off the public list and out of HACS
```

The previous stable becomes Latest again and the git tag survives. **If you then delete
the tag, the draft is orphaned and does not disappear on its own** — find and delete it
explicitly:

```bash
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/releases            # find the draft's id
gh api -X DELETE repos/OWNER/REPO/releases/ID
```

Re-cut with `gh release create vX.Y.Z --target <sha>` so the tag matches the notes it
describes. Never leave a published tag pointing at a commit whose notes have since changed.

### Verify after releasing

```bash
git fetch origin --tags
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/git/ref/tags/vX.Y.Z   # must equal main HEAD
```

`git merge-base` and `rev-parse` give false negatives until you `git fetch --tags` — a tag
created by `gh release create` exists only server-side until then.

## PowerShell Notes (Windows dev environment)

The shell is PowerShell 5.1. Bash idioms fail in ways that waste turns:

- **No heredocs.** `<<'EOF'` is a parser error. For multi-line commit messages write the
  message to a file and use `git commit -F <file>`.
- **No `&&` or `||`.** Use `;` or `if ($?) { ... }`.
- **Never write file content** — see rule 7 above. Edit/Write tools only.
- `Get-Content -Raw` misreads UTF-8. Use `Grep` or Python to check for encoding damage.
- `gh api` takes one positional arg; `--jq` with extra args fails confusingly.

## Quick Reference: File Responsibilities

| File | Purpose | When to Update |
|------|---------|----------------|
| `profiles/*.py` | Register definitions | Adding/updating registers |
| `growatt_modbus.py` | Data container (GrowattData) | **REQUIRED: Adding new sensor fields** |
| `sensor.py` | Sensor entity definitions | Adding new sensors |
| `strings.json` + `translations/en.json` | **Entity display names** | **REQUIRED: Adding new sensors** — an unnamed entity shows only the device name |
| `const.py` | Device assignments, categories | Assigning sensors to devices |
| `device_profiles.py` | Profile registry, sensor groups | Adding new profiles or sensors |
| `auto_detection.py` | Auto-detection logic | New DTC codes, refinement logic |
| `coordinator.py` | Data processing | Special handling, fallback logic |
| `diagnostic.py` | Scanner/diagnostics | Detection improvements |

## Final Notes

**Remember:** This is a multi-device integration with complex fallback logic. Changes in one area can affect others unexpectedly.

**When in doubt:**
1. Search the codebase for similar patterns
2. Check how existing registers are handled
3. Test with diagnostic tools before deploying
4. Document architectural decisions in commit messages

**For AI Assistants:**
- Follow this guide completely for every register update
- Double-check all 5 steps in the checklist
- Search for similar patterns before implementing
- Ask user to verify if uncertain about device assignments
