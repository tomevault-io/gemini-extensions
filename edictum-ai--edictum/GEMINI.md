## What is Edictum

Runtime rule enforcement for AI agent tool calls. Deterministic pipeline: checks, output checks, session rules, principal-aware enforcement. Eight framework adapters (LangChain, CrewAI, Agno, Semantic Kernel, OpenAI Agents SDK, Claude Agent SDK, Nanobot, Google ADK). Zero runtime deps in core.

Current version: 0.18.0 (PyPI: `edictum`)

## Architecture: Core + Server

Two deployment units. One library, one server.

- `src/edictum/` -- MIT core. All rule types (pre, post, session, sandbox), pipeline, 8 adapters, audit to stdout/file/OTel, local approval backend, single-process session tracking.
- `src/edictum/server/` -- Server SDK client (`pip install edictum[server]`). Implements core protocols (`ApprovalBackend`, `AuditSink`, `StorageBackend`) over HTTP to connect agents to the server.
- Hosted control plane (`edictum-api` + `edictum-app`) -- Separate deployment for centralized approval workflows, audit dashboards, distributed sessions, and hot-reload rules.

## THE ONE RULE

**Core code (src/edictum/) runs fully standalone. The server SDK (src/edictum/server/) imports from core. The control plane itself is a separate deployment.**

Core provides protocols and interfaces. The server SDK provides HTTP-backed implementations. The control plane provides the coordination infrastructure.

## Core (MIT)

- CheckPipeline (evaluation engine)
- ToolCall, Principal model, Session (MemoryBackend)
- YAML rule parsing + validation + templates + composition
- All 8 framework adapters
- Sandbox rules (`type: sandbox`) — allowlist-based governance for file paths, commands, and domains
- Observe mode
- on_postcondition_warn callbacks
- AuditEvent dataclass + StdoutAuditSink + FileAuditSink (.jsonl) + RedactionPolicy
- OTel span instrumentation + GovernanceTelemetry
- Violation classification (`findings.py`, `Finding`) with pii_detected, secret_detected, policy_violation types

## Server

The control plane is a separate deployment. It provides:

- Production approval workflows (ServerApprovalBackend connects to Telegram, Slack, Discord, webhook, and review UI)
- Centralized audit ingestion and governance dashboard (block rates, rule drift, sandbox violations)
- Distributed session state for multi-agent tracking across processes
- Hot-reload rules via SSE push (ServerContractSource) without restarting agents
- RBAC for rule management (who can create/modify/deploy rules)
- Cross-agent session tracking (correlate tool calls across agents)
- SSO integration (Okta, Azure AD) and JWT/OIDC principal verification

## Boundary Principle

The split follows one rule: **evaluation = core library, coordination = server.**

- Pipeline that takes a tool call and returns allow/block/warn -- core
- Persistence beyond local files, networking, coordination across processes -- server
- Stdout + File (.jsonl) sinks for dev/local audit -- core. Centralized audit dashboards and alerting -- server
- OTel instrumentation (emitting spans) -- core. Governance dashboards -- server
- Session (MemoryBackend) for single-process -- core. Multi-process session state via the hosted control plane -- server
- LocalApprovalBackend for development approval -- core. Production approval workflows (Telegram, Slack, Discord, review UI) -- server

## Dropped Features (do NOT implement)
- **Python CLI** — removed entirely. Go binary is the canonical CLI.
- **Gate install/uninstall** — removed from Python. Gate install is Go-only (`edictum gate install`).

- `reset_session()` — new run_id handles this naturally
- Redis StorageBackend — not our problem, application layer concern
- DB StorageBackend — OTel already covers queryable audit data

Default audit sink changed from `StdoutAuditSink` to `CollectingAuditSink` only.
- v0.16.0: Skill security analysis module (CLI removed — use Go binary). Ed25519 bundle signature verification (`edictum[verified]`). Server HTTPS enforcement. Batch session counter reads. Cross-SDK conformance runner. Terminology rename `shadow_*` → `observe_*` completed. Removed `ShadowContract` deprecation alias and `"shadows"` backward-compat JSON key. 14 security fixes including session injection, shell separator bypass, and redaction gaps.
- v0.17.0: Workflow runtime enforcement — `WorkflowRuntime`, `WorkflowRuntime.set_stage()` non-destructive stage moves preserving approvals and evidence, `WorkflowDefinition`, `WorkflowStage`, `WorkflowGate`, `WorkflowApproval`, `WorkflowCheck`, `WorkflowMetadata`, `WorkflowEvaluation`, `WorkflowEvidence`, `WorkflowState`, `load_workflow()`, `load_workflow_string()`, explicit workflow loading for M1, runtime workflow stage gating, workflow approvals, and opt-in `exec(...)` workflow conditions. Added workflow adapter evidence coverage for CrewAI, Google ADK, LangChain, and OpenAI Agents SDK. Removed the Python CLI from the package; the Go binary is canonical. Completed the M1 terminology rename across code and docs.
- v0.18.0: Workflow v0.18 shared-semantics features — fnmatch wildcard matching in workflow stage `tools` (e.g. `mcp__*`), `terminal: true` stage primitive (deny-all or seal-after-exit), `mcp_result_matches("tool","field","value")` exit gate condition with MCP result evidence recording via `record_result(mcp_result=…)`, `extends:` ruleset inheritance (`resolve_ruleset_extends`, `_merge_parent_bundle`, `_MAX_EXTENDS_DEPTH=50` depth cap), `Edictum.from_bundle_dict()` factory method (supports `mode`, `audit_sink`, `redaction`, `backend`, `environment`, `principal`, `approval_backend`, `on_block`, `on_allow`, `workflow_content`; does not support `tools`, `success_check`, `principal_resolver`, `custom_operators`, `custom_selectors`). Security: `_coerce_mcp_result` applied on both ingest and load; `None` field values map to `""` to prevent `str(None)=="None"` false positives; non-list mcp_results entries skipped at load time.

## Session Model

MemoryBackend stores counters in a Python dict -- one process, one agent. This covers the vast majority of use cases. For multi-agent coordination across processes, the hosted control plane handles centralized session tracking. There is no DIY Redis/DynamoDB path.

## Build & Test

```bash
pytest tests/ -v              # full test suite
ruff check src/ tests/        # lint
```

## Code Conventions

- Python 3.11+
- `from __future__ import annotations` in every file
- Frozen dataclasses for immutable data
- Type hints everywhere
- Async: all pipeline, session, and audit sink methods are async
- Testing: pytest + pytest-asyncio, maintain 97%+ coverage
- Commits: conventional commits (feat/fix/docs/test/refactor/chore), no Co-Authored-By
- PRs: small and focused, Linear ticket in PR description not title

## Terminology Enforcement

The binding glossary is `.docs-style-guide.md`. ALL code, comments, docstrings, CLI output, docs, release notes, and CHANGELOG entries MUST use these canonical terms:

| Wrong | Correct |
|-------|---------|
| contract / contracts | rule / rules |
| denied | blocked |
| finding | violation |
| engine (for runtime) | pipeline |
| shadow mode | observe mode |

**Exception**: None. There are no exceptions. The class was renamed from `ContractResult` to `RuleResult` in v0.8.1 to eliminate the last holdout.

Before writing ANY user-facing string, comment, docstring, or documentation, check it against the glossary.

## API Design Checklist

Before adding any new public API (function, method, parameter, class), verify ALL of these:

- **Every accepted parameter has an observable action.** If the parameter is in the signature, there must be a test proving it changes behavior. If unimplemented, raise `NotImplementedError` — never silently ignore.
- **Collection parameters have documented merge semantics.** If a parameter accepts a set/list/dict, document and test whether it EXTENDS defaults or REPLACES them. Use `merged = defaults | custom` for union.
- **Block decisions propagate end-to-end.** If the pipeline returns block, trace the path through every adapter. Never return a generic "allow" after processing a block.
- **Callbacks fire exactly once.** If a callback is invoked in an inner method AND an outer wrapper, one must be removed. Assert `callback.call_count == 1` in tests.
- **All adapters handle the new feature.** Run `pytest tests/test_adapter_parity.py -v` after any adapter change.
- **No ghost features.** If you add it to CLAUDE.md, architecture.md, or any doc page, the code must exist. Run `pytest tests/test_docs_sync.py -v`.

## Security Review Checklist

Before merging ANY code that touches these areas, verify:

- **Path handling**: Uses `os.path.realpath()` not just `normpath()`. Test with symlinks.
- **Shell command classification**: All shell metacharacters enumerated. Test with: \n, \r, |, ;, &&, ||, $(), \`\`, ${}, <(), <<, >, >>
- **Error handling in backends**: `get()` and `increment()` fail-closed. Network errors propagate, only 404 returns None.
- **Audit action accuracy**: Audit events reflect what actually happened, not just the final decision. Timeouts emit TIMEOUT, not GRANTED.
- **Input validation**: tool_name, session_id, any string used in storage keys or log messages validated for control characters.
- **Concurrency**: Read-modify-write operations use `asyncio.Lock`. Single dict operations are safe without locks.

## Behavior Test Requirement

Every public API parameter MUST have a behavior test in `tests/test_behavior/`.

A behavior test answers: "What observable action does this parameter have?"

- Tests the parameter's action through the public API (not internal state)
- Asserts a concrete difference between passing and not passing the parameter
- Lives in `tests/test_behavior/test_{module}_behavior.py`
- Keep test files focused: one file per module, under 200 lines

## Negative Security Test Requirement

Every security boundary MUST have bypass tests — tests that attempt to circumvent the boundary and verify the attempt is caught. These go in `tests/test_behavior/` alongside the positive tests, marked with `@pytest.mark.security`.

Examples:
- Sandbox: symlink escape, double-encoding, null byte injection
- BashClassifier: every shell metacharacter individually
- Session limits: concurrent access, counter reset on backend failure
- Approval: timeout edge cases, status/action combinations
- Input validation: null bytes, control characters, path separators in tool_name

## Pre-Merge Verification

Every change MUST pass these checks before committing:

```bash
pytest tests/ -v                    # full test suite
ruff check src/ tests/              # lint
pytest tests/test_docs_sync.py -v   # docs-code sync
# If touching adapters:
pytest tests/test_adapter_parity.py -v
```

## Pre-Release Checklist

Before tagging a release:

1. `grep -rn` for banned terms (contract/contracts, denied, engine, shadow mode) in src/, docs/, CHANGELOG.md
2. Verify CLI output strings match .docs-style-guide.md terminology
3. Verify YAML examples in release notes use correct schema (`then:` block with `action:` and `message:`, not `effect:`)
4. Verify release notes prose uses canonical terms
5. Run: `pytest tests/ -v && ruff check src/ tests/`

## YAML Schema (locked)

- `apiVersion: edictum/v1`, `kind: Ruleset`
- Rule types: `type: pre` (block/ask), `type: post` (warn/redact/block), `type: session` (block only), `type: sandbox` (allowlist-based, outside: block/ask)
- Conditions: `when:` with boolean AST (`all/any/not`) and leaves (`selector: {operator: value}`)
- 15 operators: exists, equals, not_equals, in, not_in, contains, contains_any, starts_with, ends_with, matches, matches_any, gt, gte, lt, lte
- Missing fields evaluate to `false`. Type mismatches yield block/warn + `policy_error: true`
- Regex: Python `re` module, single-quoted in YAML docs (`'\b'` not `"\b"`)
- Bundle hash: SHA256 of raw YAML bytes -> `policy_version` on every audit event

## Cross-SDK Conformance Workflow

When a change affects shared semantics, YAML validation, fixture behavior, audit/tool_call wire format, or policy evaluation behavior, you MUST follow this workflow before merging:

1. **Update shared fixtures** in `edictum-schemas` — add or modify `fixtures/rejection/*.rejection.yaml` files as needed
2. **Update canonical Python behavior** in this repo if the change originates here
3. **Ensure all three SDKs pass** — Python, Go (`edictum-go`), and TypeScript (`edictum-ts`) shared-fixture runners must all pass with `EDICTUM_CONFORMANCE_REQUIRED=1`
4. **Do not merge** parity-affecting behavior without the Parity Check workflow passing in all affected repos

The conformance runner in this repo lives at `tests/test_conformance/test_rejection.py` and is executed in CI by:

```bash
EDICTUM_SCHEMAS_DIR=edictum-schemas EDICTUM_CONFORMANCE_REQUIRED=1 \
  pytest tests/test_conformance/ -v
```

The `Parity Check` workflow (`.github/workflows/parity-check.yml`) runs on PRs to main, pushes to main, and weekly. It is intended to be a required status check.
