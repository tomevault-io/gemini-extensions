# Claude Code Guide for Bamboo CSS

This guide helps AI assistants understand the Bamboo CSS codebase structure, conventions, and best practices.

## Project Overview

Bamboo CSS is a CSS-in-JS framework with static extraction capabilities. The project is a monorepo managed by **pnpm**
with workspace support.

## Key Architecture

### Monorepo Structure

```
/packages/          # Core packages published to npm
  /core/           # CSS processing, rule generation, optimization
  /shared/         # Runtime helpers shipped into styled-system (css, cva, splitProps, memo)
  /node/           # Node.js APIs, config resolution, file watching
  /cli/            # CLI tool (@bamboocss/dev package)
  /parser/         # Static analysis and extraction
  /extractor/      # Expression evaluation behind the parser
  /ts-ast/         # AST backend on TypeScript 7's Go compiler, used by parser, extractor, node and vite
  /generator/      # Code generation for styled-system
  /config/         # Config loading and resolution
  /types/          # Type definitions (config options live here)
  /native-extractor/ # Rust/Oxc stylesheet extraction and static evaluation engine
  /vite/           # Vite plugin, including the build-time fold
  /plugin-*/       # vue and svelte are auto-injected; lightningcss is opt-in
  /preset-*/       # Design system presets (base, bamboo, atlaskit, open-props)
  /eslint-plugin/  # Lint rules
  /fixture/        # Shared test fixtures and utilities
  /logger/, /reporter/, /mcp/, /is-valid-prop/, /token-dictionary/

/sandbox/          # Integration tests and examples
  /codegen/        # Generated code validation tests (the scenario suites)
  /runtime-perf/   # Bundle-size and real-build assertions, on Vite 7 and Vite 8/Rolldown
 /vite-ts/, /astro/, /nuxt/, /svelte/, /solid-ts/,
 /preact-ts/, /qwik-ts/,
  /storybook/, /component-lib/    # per-framework integration apps
  /rsc/            # React Server Components through @vitejs/plugin-rsc; its test asserts that a
                   # sheet emitted by the server build is pruned against every environment

/website/          # Documentation site
```

Keep this list honest when packages come and go. A stale entry here is not cosmetic — it sends agents looking for files
that moved, and a removed suite documented as still running reads as coverage that does not exist.

### Key Concepts

1. **Static Extraction**: Bamboo analyzes source files to extract styles at build time
2. **Design Tokens**: Type-safe design tokens defined in config
3. **Recipes**: Reusable component style patterns (like variants)
4. **Conditions**: Responsive and state-based styling (e.g., `_hover`, `md:`, `_dark`)
5. **CSS Optimization**: Uses PostCSS (default) or LightningCSS (optional) for CSS processing

## Critical Rules

### 🚨 CSS Output is Sacred

**NEVER** accept changes that modify CSS output snapshots without explicit user approval:

- Run tests BEFORE and AFTER any dependency updates
- If snapshots change, investigate why and get user confirmation
- The test `packages/core/__tests__/atomic-rule.test.ts` is the primary CSS output validator
- CSS output consistency is more important than using latest package versions

### 🚨 Verify Before Reporting

**A pipeline's exit code is the last command's.** `pnpm check 2>&1 | tail -20` exits 0 whether the check passed or
failed, and `… | grep FAIL` exits 1 when it merely found nothing. Both were reported as results in one session — once as
a green check that was actually failing. Capture the real one:

```bash
pnpm check > /tmp/check.log 2>&1; echo "EXIT=$?"
```

**`tsc` colours its diagnostics, so `error` and `TS2345` are separated by escape codes.** Grepping a `pnpm typecheck`
run for `error TS` prints nothing whether or not it failed; one commit reached CI that way with a type error a plain
`pnpm typecheck; echo "EXIT=$?"` would have shown. Read the exit code, and the lines above it.

**`git checkout HEAD -- <file>` discards uncommitted work, with no reflog entry to recover it.** So does a `git stash`
whose flag is malformed — `--keep-index=false` is not a valid form, and the stash silently does not happen, which leaves
a "before" measurement that is really the "after" tree. Commit or copy to a scratch directory first, then confirm the
state actually changed (`grep` for something the change added) before trusting anything measured against it.

**With the TypeScript 7 backend, a file joining the shared project is a full program reload.** Membership is the
synthesized tsconfig's `files` list, so every `addSourceFile` of a path the project does not hold rewrites that list and
has the Go compiler re-derive a program the size of the whole inventory — about a second on 7,000 files — and it bumps
the tree revision every importer's cached import resolutions are checked against. The Vite compiler therefore must not
add a source per module it is handed: it skips modules outside `include`/`exclude` and framework rewrites that reach
nothing bamboo (`packages/vite/src/plugin.ts`, `compileModule`), and an auxiliary `X.__bamboo__.tsx` is a content event,
not a tree change (`packages/parser/src/project.ts`, `addSourceFile`). Contra's production build went from timing out at
30 minutes to finishing because of exactly this; profile with `--inspect` and a 20-second CPU profile of the transform
phase before assuming the fold itself is slow.

**Killing a test run can leave half-built packages behind.** `packages/vite/__tests__/built-package-consumer.test.ts`
runs `pnpm build` for any package whose `dist` lacks declarations, and a run stopped in the middle of that leaves a
`dist` holding `index.cjs` and nothing else. Every later test that imports the package's ESM entry then fails with
`ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND`, and some of them hang instead of failing, which read as a stuck suite for over an hour. After
stopping a run, `ls packages/*/dist/index.mjs` and run `pnpm build` before trusting anything.

That build is a hazard even when nothing is stopped. tsdown deletes a package's `dist` entry for much of its build, and
the eslint plugin's synckit worker loads `@bamboocss/config` and `@bamboocss/generator` from `dist` when it starts, so a
test starting a worker inside that window hangs until the CI job's 20-minute limit — `Unit Tests 2/3` did, three times.
The root `vitest.config.ts` runs the file as its own project in a later `sequence.groupOrder`, after every other file in
the run or shard, and sets `SYNCKIT_TIMEOUT` so a worker that never starts fails within a minute. Keep it out of the
main project.

**Generated artifacts under `packages/generator/src/artifacts/generated` are built from `dist`, not from the working
tree.** Committing source that has not been rebuilt leaves those artifacts generated from a different revision, and CI
fails on the "Check generated output is committed" step. Run `pnpm build` before committing anything that changes what
the generator emits.

### Testing Workflow

🚨 **The codegen and sandbox suites run against generated artifacts on disk, and their test commands do not regenerate
them.** A stale `styled-system/` fails tests the current source passes; it can equally pass tests the current source
fails. Twice in one session this read as a regression that did not exist. Regenerate before believing a result there:

```bash
pnpm --filter=./sandbox/codegen exec tsx ./cli.ts codegen     # all scenarios
pnpm --filter=./sandbox/<name> exec bamboo codegen --clean    # one sandbox
```

🚨 **`pnpm check` does not run `pnpm fmt`, and CI does.** `check` is
`build && typecheck && lint && test run && test:codegen` — formatting is a separate CI job
(`.github/workflows/quality.yml`, "Format"). A green `pnpm check` therefore says nothing about whether the branch
formats, and an unformatted changeset is enough to fail the build. Run `pnpm fmt` before committing, or
`pnpm exec oxfmt <paths>` to fix in place.

🚨 **Nothing drives a real browser any more, and no check reads a computed style.** The browser-parity suite built the
sandbox twice — folded and unfolded — and compared what Chromium computed. Mandatory compilation (`13ce729fc`) left no
unfolded build to compare against, so it went along with its fixtures, the `playwright` dependency and its CI job.

What carries the guarantee it existed for — that a class the transform emits actually has a rule behind it — is now
static: `sandbox/runtime-perf/__tests__/vite-plugin.test.ts` proves the CSS and Vite source graphs agree, and
`packages/vite/__tests__/strict-compiler.test.ts` covers the calls the compiler must reject. Both run in `pnpm test`, so
there is no separate command to remember. Neither observes rendering. What is emitted is checked against the CSS grammar
— `invalidDeclaration`, collected by `Stylesheet.toCss` and graded in `Generator.getCss` — so a declaration the browser
would drop is reported. A rule that is valid CSS and still not what was meant passes everything, and so does any value
reading a variable, which the grammar cannot judge.

**Where the framework-runtime guarantees actually live.** Per-framework _test suites_ no longer exist — they were
removed with the JSX factory in `f2d5df251`, and the `sandbox/*` framework apps that remain are integration examples,
not assertions about the shared runtime. What protects that runtime now is
`packages/shared/__tests__/split-props.test.ts`, which models the framework semantics directly: Solid-style accessor
props, `mergeProps` proxies with trap counting, and key order within each bucket.

That file exists because of a real regression: assigning props instead of copying their descriptors passed everything
else and broke Solid's `createStyleContext`, because Solid compiles props to accessors and reading one eagerly builds a
component's children before its provider exists. A change to `packages/shared/src` that touches how props are read
belongs in that test, since nothing downstream will catch it.

**Generated test projects must live outside the checkout.** The TypeScript compiler is process-global, so a test that
writes a `styled-system` package under `packages/**` can be discovered by unrelated resolution tests running in
parallel. This made `resolution-ledger.test.ts` resolve its virtual `/app` imports into the CLI test's temporary output.
Use `mkdtempSync(tmpdir())`, and remove the whole directory in teardown.

**Always run tests from the project root:**

```bash
# ✅ Correct
pnpm test packages/core
pnpm test packages/parser

# ❌ Incorrect
cd packages/core && pnpm test
```

**Key test commands:**

```bash
pnpm test <path>              # Run tests for specific package/file
pnpm test packages/core       # Test all core package tests
pnpm build                    # Build all packages
pnpm build-fast               # Fast build without type definitions
```

### Benchmarks

Perf-sensitive code has Vitest benchmarks in `{packages,sandbox}/*/__tests__/**/*.bench.ts`:

| bench                                           | covers                                                        |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `core/static-css-perf`, `static-css-real-world` | static css generation, up to `getCssRuleObjects`              |
| `core/optimize-css`                             | the postcss pipeline after the sheet is built                 |
| `core/prune`                                    | keyframe and token pruning                                    |
| `core/sort-style-rules`                         | rule ordering                                                 |
| `extractor/extract-speed`                       | expression evaluation, one file                               |
| `extractor/cross-file-cost`                     | extraction cost as a function of _project_ size               |
| `parser/ts-eval`, `parser/extract-modes`        | extraction                                                    |
| `generator/css-fn`, `cva`, `recipe`             | the generated runtime, cached path                            |
| `generator/css-fn-miss`                         | the uncached path; kept in its own file so ordering can't lie |
| `native-extractor/analyze`                      | batched Rust parsing, analysis and compact result transfer    |
| `shared/split-props`, `shared/leaf-class`       | runtime helpers on the per-render path                        |
| `vite/fold`                                     | the fold's per-module cost                                    |

Nothing measures what the compiled output costs to _render_. `sandbox/runtime-perf/render.bench.ts` did, and went with
`13ce729fc` — it drove the old `foldSource` signature over fixtures that commit deleted. Compilation now runs on every
dev-server transform, not just production builds, so that gap is wider than it was when the bench existed.

A bench that measures a shape nothing calls is worse than no bench, because it reads as coverage. `split-props.bench.ts`
spent a while measuring only the four-group shape that went away with the JSX factory, which left the one-array-group
shape every recipe actually uses with nothing at all. When a caller is removed, check what its benchmarks were for.

**Profile the current extraction pipeline.** Stylesheet extraction runs in Rust/Oxc through `packages/native-extractor`,
with hooks and result encoding at the JavaScript boundary in `packages/node/src/create-context.ts`. The Vite source
compiler still uses the TypeScript 7 project. A V8 CPU profile can show time crossing the native boundary but cannot
attribute Rust internals; pair it with a native profiler when investigating the evaluator. Use
`packages/native-extractor/__tests__/analyze.bench.ts` for the native batch boundary and an end-to-end build for total
cost. The former ts-morph profile describes a retired backend and must not guide current optimization decisions.

🚨 **Nothing in CI catches a performance regression.** The Quality workflow runs format, tests, lint, knip and typecheck
— benchmarks are excluded on purpose, for the reason below. That makes measuring a _manual obligation before
committing_, not an optional follow-up:

- Touching a path with a benchmark, or any hot path — extraction, the generated runtime, the fold, css emission — means
  taking a before and after reading and reporting the diff in the commit.
- If the change is meant to be perf-neutral, say so and show the numbers. "Should be fine" is how regressions land.
- If a benchmark does not cover the path you changed, that is a reason to add one, not a reason to skip measuring.

This is not hypothetical. A per-call-site import scan added to the vite fold cost **+74%** on the largest sandbox file
and was caught only because the change happened to be re-measured. Nothing else would have found it.

```bash
pnpm bench                    # Run the Vitest benchmark suites
pnpm bench <path>             # Run one suite, e.g. pnpm bench extract-speed
pnpm bench:baseline           # Record a baseline to bench/baseline.json
pnpm bench:compare            # Re-run and diff against that baseline
pnpm bench:vite-import        # Cold-import the built Vite package in fresh processes
```

**Emitted CSS size is asserted, not benchmarked.** `sandbox/runtime-perf/__tests__/bundle-size.test.ts` builds a fixture
that authors the same declarations through `css()`, a recipe base, a recipe variant and a second recipe, then asserts
each reaches the stylesheet once and that the sheet stays under a byte ceiling. Bytes are deterministic, so this belongs
in CI where a wall-clock measurement would only be flaky. The duplication counts are the stable half — they hold
regardless of formatting or token values, and they fail the moment global atom sharing breaks. The ceiling is loose on
purpose and prints the real figure, so raising it is a one-line decision.

**Benchmarks are reported, not asserted.** Wall-clock numbers depend on the machine and its load, so they are
deliberately excluded from `pnpm check` and CI — a threshold would fail on a busy runner rather than on a real
regression. Where behaviour must not regress, lock it down by counting the work instead of timing it — e.g.
`packages/shared/__tests__/memo.test.ts` counts serialization calls rather than measuring them, and that _does_ run in
CI. If a change you cannot benchmark deterministically still matters, that is the shape to reach for.

To measure a change, take both readings on the same idle machine:

```bash
git stash && pnpm bench:baseline    # unchanged tree
git stash pop && pnpm bench:compare # changed tree
```

🚨 **`git stash` only reverts source, so a bench that runs through a build measures the same code twice.** Three paths
do:

- The `sandbox/*/styled-system` artifacts bundle `@bamboocss/shared` from its **dist**. Editing `packages/shared/src`
  and re-running a sandbox bench changes nothing until
  `pnpm --filter=@bamboocss/shared build && pnpm --filter=./sandbox/<name> exec bamboo codegen`.
- `bamboo codegen` uses the **built** generator, so stashing `packages/generator/src` does not change what it emits.
- `pnpm bench:vite-import` imports `packages/vite/dist/index.mjs`, so Vite source changes are invisible until that
  package is rebuilt. For a reproducible A/B, retain separately named before/after entries as documented in
  `bench/README.md`.

All three fail silently — identical numbers read as "no regression" rather than as a broken measurement. When the A/B
lands inside ~1%, assume the harness before believing the result, and confirm the artifact actually differs (`grep` for
something the change added) before trusting either reading. Patching the generated file directly is the reliable A/B.

Read the `rme` and `samples` columns before believing a diff: a bench reporting ±15% cannot show you a 10% regression,
and one reporting a handful of samples cannot show you anything.

**Read the control in every run.** Each bench file pairs the path under test with a control that the change cannot touch
— `parse only` against `parse + fold`. If the control moved between the two readings, the machine did, and the
comparison is void however clean the numbers look. One A/B here ran at load average 12 and moved its control 3.6x.

**Measure the unit you changed, not the thing containing it.** `parse + fold` is dominated by parsing, so a 178x
improvement in the fold showed up there as noise; subtracting the control exposed it. If the thing you changed is a
small fraction of what you are timing, you are measuring the fraction you did not change.

Back-to-back runs of an unchanged tree currently agree to within ~5%, so **treat anything under ~10% as noise.** The one
exception is `rule set 3 only (base styles)`, which is sub-0.1ms and swings further. Three things keep it there, and are
worth preserving when editing benches:

- The scripts pass `--no-file-parallelism`. Vitest otherwise runs bench files concurrently, and the CPU contention
  inflates rme past the effect sizes these exist to catch. It is also no slower overall.
- `warmupIterations` has to cover lazy init, not just JIT. Whichever expensive bench runs first pays for module init of
  the path under test; at one warmup iteration the same bench read 750ms in one run and 198ms in the next.
- `iterations` is a floor on sample count, _not_ a cap, and `time` (default 500ms) is the sampling budget. Raise `time`
  for fast cases and `iterations` for cases slow enough that 500ms only buys a few samples.

### Package Management

**Use `--ignore-scripts` for dependency updates:**

```bash
pnpm install --ignore-scripts
pnpm update <package> --ignore-scripts
```

**When updating PostCSS or browserslist-related packages:**

1. Update package.json versions
2. Run `pnpm install --ignore-scripts`
3. Run `pnpm test packages/core` to verify CSS output unchanged
4. Check for browserslist warnings in sandbox projects
5. Create changeset if changes affect users

### Dependency Strategy

- **PostCSS ecosystem**: Coordinate updates across all PostCSS plugins to avoid CSS output changes
- **browserslist**: Only reaches LightningCSS now. `merge-rules` was inlined
  (`packages/core/src/plugins/merge-rules.ts`) specifically to shed the browserslist and caniuse-api dependencies, and
  the PostCSS path pins a hardcoded `BASELINE` so a consuming project's browserslist cannot shift CSS output
- **lightningcss**: Opt-in only. The user installs `@bamboocss/plugin-lightningcss` and lists `pluginLightningcss()` in
  `plugins` (that package owns the `lightningcss` dependency, not core); depends on browserslist for targets. The
  `config.lightningcss` flag is removed and now throws — it forced a static import, so every project carried the native
  binary whether or not it was on
- **Node.js packages**: Core packages (`@bamboocss/core`, `@bamboocss/node`, etc.) must stay in sync

## Common Workflows

### Making Code Changes

1. Read relevant source files in `/packages/<name>/src/`
2. Understand the change impact (does it affect CSS output?)
3. Make changes
4. Run tests: `pnpm test packages/<name>`
5. If tests fail, investigate and fix (don't just update snapshots)
6. Create changeset for user-facing changes

### Updating Dependencies

1. Check current versions in package.json
2. Research latest compatible versions
3. Update package.json files
4. Run `pnpm install --ignore-scripts`
5. **Run CSS output tests first**: `pnpm test packages/core/__tests__/atomic-rule.test.ts`
6. If snapshots change, investigate the root cause
7. Run broader test suite: `pnpm test packages/core`
8. Create changeset documenting the update

### Creating Changesets

```bash
# Changesets are in .changeset/ directory
# Create a new file: .changeset/<descriptive-name>.md
```

**Format:**

```markdown
---
'@bamboocss/package-name': patch|minor|major
---

Brief description of the change and its impact.

- Detail 1
- Detail 2
```

**Changeset types:**

- `patch`: Bug fixes, dependency updates, non-breaking changes
- `minor`: New features, backwards-compatible changes
- `major`: Breaking changes

## Important Files & Patterns

### Configuration Flow

1. User config → `packages/config/` → Config resolution
2. Config hooks → `packages/types/src/hooks.ts` (registered through `plugins`; the top-level `hooks` key is removed)
3. Context creation → `packages/node/src/` → `BambooContext`
4. Code generation → `packages/generator/`

### CSS Processing Flow

1. Style objects → `packages/core/src/rule-processor.ts`
2. CSS generation → `packages/core/src/stylesheet.ts`. Utilities are written into cascade sublayers keyed by
   specificity, condition and property priority (`packages/core/src/layers.ts`), so precedence between sublayers does
   not depend on rule arrival order. Source order still breaks ties within a sublayer.
   `packages/core/__tests__/cascade-oracle.test.ts` models the browser's cascade and pins the winner of every competing
   pair in a corpus; a change to where rules are written has to leave that snapshot untouched. Rules enter the postcss
   tree as strings, which strips their positions, so the dev server's source map for the stylesheet is read off the
   served text (`cssSourceMap` in `packages/vite/src/css-output-module.ts`) against call sites the encoder recorded
   under `recordOrigins` — on only when Vite's `css.devSourcemap` is.
3. Optimization → `packages/core/src/optimize.ts` dispatches; the PostCSS plugin order lives in
   `packages/core/src/plugins/optimize-postcss.ts`
   - LightningCSS path: `packages/plugin-lightningcss/src/optimize-lightningcss.ts`, reached through the `css:optimize`
     hook when the user lists `pluginLightningcss()` in `plugins`

### Test Fixtures

- `packages/fixture/` contains shared test utilities
- `createContext()` and `createRuleProcessor()` are used throughout tests
- Fixtures provide a base config with design tokens and recipes

## Debugging Tips

### Understanding Test Failures

**Snapshot mismatches:**

- Compare expected vs received CSS output carefully
- Look for media query ordering, selector merging, or whitespace changes
- Identify which dependency update caused the change
- Common culprits: the inlined `merge-rules`, `postcss-nested`, `postcss-minify-selectors`

**Build failures:**

- Check TypeScript errors in `packages/*/src/`
- Run `pnpm build-fast` for faster iteration without type checking
- Use `pnpm typecheck` for type-only validation

### Finding Code

**Use search tools strategically:**

- Grep for function names, class names, or specific strings
- Check both `/src/` and `/__tests__/` directories
- Look in `/packages/types/src/` for type definitions
- Config options are defined in `packages/types/src/config.ts`

## Watch Out For

1. **Circular dependencies**: Be careful when adding imports between core packages
2. **Browser compatibility**: Changes to browserslist affect CSS transformation
3. **PostCSS plugin order**: Order matters in `optimize-postcss.ts`
4. **Workspace protocol**: Internal packages use `workspace:*` in dependencies
5. **Multiple package.json**: Each package has its own, plus root package.json
6. **Sandbox warnings**: Even if main packages are fine, check sandbox projects for warnings
7. **Compiler dependencies**: The TypeScript 7 backend is accessed through `@bamboocss/ts-ast`; stylesheet extraction
   uses Rust/Oxc. Validate the affected parser, compiler, and native-extraction tests when updating either backend. The
   ordinary TypeScript type checker is a separate dependency; there is no ts-morph version to synchronize.

## Package Relationships

```
@bamboocss/dev (CLI)
  ├─ @bamboocss/node (core runtime)
  │   ├─ @bamboocss/core (CSS processing)
  │   ├─ @bamboocss/parser (parser result model and TypeScript APIs used by Vite compilation)
  │   ├─ @bamboocss/native-extractor (private Rust/Oxc stylesheet extraction build package)
  │   ├─ @bamboocss/generator (codegen)
  │   └─ @bamboocss/config (config resolution)

@bamboocss/core
  ├─ postcss (CSS processing)
  ├─ browserslist (browser targets)
  └─ postcss-* plugins (optimization)

@bamboocss/plugin-lightningcss     # not a core dependency — installed and
  ├─ lightningcss                  # listed in `plugins` by the user
  └─ browserslist
```

## Useful References

- **Main documentation**: `/website/` (documentation source)
- **Type definitions**: `packages/types/src/` (comprehensive types)
- **Integration examples**: `/sandbox/` (real-world usage)
- **Test patterns**: `packages/fixture/` and `packages/core/__tests__/`

## Best Practices for AI Assistants

1. **Always read before writing**: Understand existing patterns before making changes
2. **Test incrementally**: Run tests after small changes, not just at the end
3. **Preserve CSS output**: When in doubt, prioritize CSS output stability
4. **Use workspace knowledge**: Remember this is a monorepo - changes may affect multiple packages
5. **Document breaking changes**: If CSS output must change, explain why clearly
6. **Check sandboxes**: Don't just test main packages - verify sandbox projects too

## Emergency Rollback

If a dependency update breaks things:

```bash
git restore --source=HEAD -- ':(glob)packages/*/package.json'   # only the 25 manifests
pnpm install --ignore-scripts                                   # restore dependencies
pnpm test packages/core                                         # verify tests pass
```

The `:(glob)` magic is load-bearing: in a plain git pathspec `*` crosses `/`, so `packages/*/package.json` also matches
the fixture manifests under `packages/config/__tests__/samples/`. With it, `*` stops at one level.

🚨 Scope the path. This used to say `git checkout packages/`, which reverts **every** uncommitted source change under
`packages/` — not just the manifests — with no reflog entry to recover them. See the warning under "Verify Before
Reporting": copy anything uncommitted to a scratch directory first.
