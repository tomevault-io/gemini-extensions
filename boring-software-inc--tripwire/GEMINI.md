# Tripwire Development Guidelines

You are a professional software engineer. All code must follow best practices: accurate, readable, clean, and efficient.

## Global Standards

- **Comments**: Use JSDoc for exported functions/types only. No ASCII divider comments (`// ─── Section ───`). No decorative multi-line doc comments.
- **Styling**: Never use local classnames on componenets unless you really need to. Keep all styling to global tokens.
- **Package Manager**: Use `pnpm`, not `npm` or `yarn`.
- **Lint**:
  - **Repo root** (`pnpm lint`): runs **ESLint** on the monorepo (`eslint.config.js`), then **`pnpm --filter @tripwire/web lint`** (**Biome** rules for `apps/web` only — structural/import restrictions such as restricted elements).
  - **`apps/web` alone**: `pnpm --filter @tripwire/web lint` is Biome only; use root `pnpm lint` before CI-style checks.
  - ESLint ignores generated and tooling dirs: `node_modules`, `dist`, `.output`, `.turbo`, `.claude`, `.cursor`, `.tanstack`, `.nitro`, `.vinxi`, `**/routeTree.gen.ts`, etc.
- **Server/Client Boundary**: Never import `@tripwire/db` or `@tripwire/core` barrels in client code. Use subpath imports (`@tripwire/db/schema/rule-meta`, `@tripwire/core/rules/signal-registry`, `@tripwire/core/workflow-registry`) for pure-data modules. `import type` is always safe.
- **No Effects for Prop Sync**: Never use `useEffect` to sync props to state. Use `key` props to remount, derived state, or controlled components.

## Architecture

### Core Principles

1. Single Responsibility: Each component, hook, store has one clear purpose
2. Composition Over Complexity: Break down complex logic into smaller pieces
3. Type Safety First: TypeScript interfaces for all props, state, return types
4. No Helpers in Components: Put utility functions in `apps/web/src/lib/` or `packages/*/src/`, never inside component or tool files
5. Never use raw html components (<button>, <input>, <select><option></select>, etc). Always use their react counterparts defined in `apps/web/src/components/ui` (shared primitives such as `Button` live in `@tripwire/ui` and are re-exported under `#/components/ui` for the app).
   If you're unable to find the right component, explore the coss ui directory. `https://coss.com/ui/docs`
6. Never define a raw vector (`<svg`) outside `apps/web/src/components/icons/` (for the app) or `packages/ui/src/icons/` (for shared UI). Import icon components from there and follow the same patterns as existing icons.
7. Never introduce a raw inline type to a component-level or route-level file. Keep it scoped to a generally existing file which the majority of other similar types live.
8. Absolutely do not spam single line comments above every change. Comments should be sparce, contain no em dashes or overly verbose language patterns, and should ONLY be used to give important context about programmatic decisions, nuance, etc. Never to just explain what a line does, especially given that every function, const, etc should be highly readable as is.

```

### Package Boundaries

- `apps/* -> packages/*` only. Packages never import from `apps/*`.
- Each package has explicit subpath `exports` in `package.json`. Use subpaths for client-safe imports to avoid pulling server-only dependencies (Drizzle, pg) into the browser bundle.
- Auth is shared via Better Auth with Autumn for billing.

### Naming Conventions

- Components: PascalCase (`RuleCardGrid`)
- Hooks: `use` prefix (`useWorkspace`)
- Files: kebab-case (`rule-card-grid.tsx`)
- Constants: SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE
- Interfaces: PascalCase with suffix (`WorkflowEditorProps`)

## Imports

Use path aliases. `#/` maps to `apps/web/src/`.

```typescript
// Good
import { useTRPC } from "#/integrations/trpc/react"
import { formatCamelCase } from "#/lib/format"

// Bad
import { useTRPC } from "../../../integrations/trpc/react"
```

Use `import type { X }` for type-only imports. This is critical for the server/client boundary.

### Import Order

1. React/core libraries
2. External libraries
3. UI components (`#/components/ui/`)
4. Utilities (`#/lib/`)
5. Feature imports
6. Package imports (`@tripwire/*`)

## TypeScript

1. No `any` — use proper types or `unknown` with type guards
2. Always define props interface for components
3. `as const` for constant objects/arrays
4. Explicit ref types: `useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null)`

## Components

```typescript
interface ComponentProps {
  requiredProp: string
  optionalProp?: boolean
}

export function Component({
  requiredProp,
  optionalProp = false,
}: ComponentProps) {
  // Order: refs -> external hooks -> state -> useMemo -> useCallback -> return
}
```

Extract when: 50+ lines, used in 2+ files, or has own state/logic. Keep inline when: < 10 lines, single use, purely presentational.

## tRPC Routers

All server state mutations go through tRPC routers in `apps/web/src/integrations/trpc/routers/`. Each router uses `authedProcedure` for auth:

```typescript
export const featureRouter = {
  list: authedProcedure
    .input(z.object({ repoId: z.string().uuid() }))
    .query(async ({ input, ctx }) => { ... }),
  create: authedProcedure
    .input(createSchema)
    .mutation(async ({ input, ctx }) => { ... }),
} satisfies TRPCRouterRecord;
```

Register in `apps/web/src/integrations/trpc/router.ts`.

## Tool Definitions

Tools live in `packages/tools/src/definitions/`. Each tool follows `ToolDefinition`:

```typescript
defineTool({
  name: "tool_name",
  description: "What it does",
  inputSchema: z.object({ ... }),  // Never include repoId — adapters handle it
  surfaces: ["chat", "mcp"],       // Where the tool is exposed
  needsApproval: true,             // Requires user confirmation
  needsRepo: true,                 // Needs a repo context (default true)
  handler: async (input, ctx) => { ... },
  chatRender: (result) => makeSpec("CardType", { ... }),
})
```

Register in `packages/tools/src/index.ts`.

### Adding a New Tool

1. Create the tool in `packages/tools/src/definitions/<category>.ts`
2. Export from the category file's tools array
3. Import and spread in `packages/tools/src/index.ts`
4. The tool auto-appears in both MCP and chat (per `surfaces` config)

## Workflow System

### Node Registry

All workflow node types are defined in `packages/core/src/workflow-registry.ts`. This is the single source of truth for what nodes exist, their parameters, handles, and categories. Both the UI palette and AI agent consume this registry.

Categories: Triggers, Rules, Conditions, Logic Gates, Actions, Delays, Transforms.

### Operations Engine

Workflow mutations use an operations DSL in `packages/core/src/workflow-operations.ts`:

```typescript
const operations = [
  { op: "add_node", type: "trigger", subtype: "pr_opened" },
  { op: "add_node", type: "rule", subtype: "accountAge", data: { days: 30 } },
  { op: "add_edge", source: "node-1", target: "node-2", sourceHandle: "pass" },
]

const result = applyWorkflowOperations(currentState, operations)
// result: { state, errors[], warnings[] }
```

The AI agent uses the `edit_workflow` tool with this DSL. The engine validates types against the registry, auto-positions nodes, and cascades edge deletions.

### Custom Rules

Custom rules are condition graphs (conditions + logic gates) stored in `custom_rules` table. They use the same operations engine but restricted to `condition`, `logic`, and `transform` node types. Custom rules are a paid feature (free: 2, pro: 10).

## Styling

Use Tailwind only, no inline styles. Use `cn()` from `@tripwire/ui/utils` for conditional classes.

```typescript
<div className={cn("base-classes", isActive && "active-classes")} />
```

Design tokens use `tw-` prefix CSS variables: `text-tw-text-primary`, `bg-tw-surface`, `border-tw-border`, etc.

## Testing

Use Vitest. Test files: `feature.ts` -> `feature.test.ts`. Run with `pnpm test` in the relevant package.

## Commit Messages & Pull Requests

Always include the Median task ID in commit messages and PR titles:

```
git commit -m "MDN-42 fix: resolve auth token expiry"
```

## Median Tasks

Before starting work, check assigned tasks:

```
mdn tasks --agent <your-agent-name>
```

Pick up: `mdn status <TASK-CODE> in_progress --agent <your-agent-name>`
Complete: `mdn status <TASK-CODE> ready --agent <your-agent-name>`
Create: `mdn create --title "Description" --status todo --priority medium --agent <your-agent-name>`

## Learned User Preferences

- Prefer copy edits that preserve the user's original wording and tone rather than rewrites.
- Prefer casual, human-sounding writing; avoid polished AI patterns.
- Avoid em dashes and formulaic contrast phrasing like "it's not X, it's Y."
- When showing tightly related counters in UI, prefer one plain sentence that partitions the numbers once instead of repeating the same figure in multiple ratio fragments.
- When merging another branch or PR into the user's work, keep the user's version for server-side code, APIs, and core app logic; only favor incoming changes for clear UI or shared-type conflicts.
- For SVG markup that uses fill="currentColor", set visible color via Tailwind text-\* (CSS color).
- Tailwind only emits utilities it can see as literal class substrings at build time; do not rely on template strings that build arbitrary pixel width classes from variables.

## Learned Workspace Facts

- Rules workspace uses path segments under `/{orgHandle}/rules/` (`marketplace`, `installed`, `people`, `requests`, `files`, `workflows`, plus `custom`); bare `/rules` should land on `marketplace`. Legacy `?tab=` values canonicalize to those paths with `replace: true`. Custom-rule flows should use consistent paths (for example `…/rules/custom/new`) without redundant `tab` query params.
- When turning `location.search` into a query string for redirects or links, handle both string and parsed-object shapes—avoid interpolating search into templates when it might stringify as `[object Object]`.
- TanStack Router typed `Link` may reject dynamic paths built as `` `/${orgHandle}/…` `` against generated route unions; use an intermediate variable typed as `string` or typed route IDs with `params` when needed.
- In dev, `[router]` console timings plus `[vite]` logs for slower `/routes/` module responses help separate compile/transform cost from client navigation and render.
