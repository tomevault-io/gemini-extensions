# AGENTS.md

Herdr Auto Title — a Herdr plugin, written in Go, that generates tab titles from
each tab's current context. Long-running process that polls the Herdr session,
no LLM and no external service.

## Repository layout

```
cmd/herdr-auto-title  the binary
internal/app          the poll loop and the reads it spends, configuration
internal/herdr        the socket client; herdrtest beside it is its stub
internal/state        a session snapshot turned into what each tab is doing
internal/resolver     that state turned into a title, one source at a time
internal/claude       what a Claude Code session is about, from its transcript
internal/git          what a repository has checked out, read from .git
scripts/              the Python probes
docs/architecture/    how the plugin works and why
```

Each package's doc comment says the rest.

## Language rule (mandatory)

**Everything written into this repository is in English.** Code comments, commit
messages, log and error messages, documentation, test names, ticket text — all
English, with no exceptions. This holds regardless of the language the request
was made in; only the conversation with the user follows the user's language.

## Commit convention (mandatory)

Commits follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org):

```
<type>(<optional scope>): <subject>

<optional body explaining why, wrapped at 72 columns>
```

Types in use: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `test`, `refactor`, `perf`, `chore`.
Scope is a package or area (`resolver`, `state`, `herdr`, `app`).

- Subject in the imperative mood, lowercase, no trailing period, ≤72 characters
  ("add manual rename protection", not "Added manual rename protection.").
- The body explains why, not what — the diff already says what.
- One logical change per commit.
- Never add a co-author trailer.

## Branches and pull requests (mandatory)

**Never commit to `main`.** Branch from it first, named `<type>/<kebab-summary>`
with the types the commits use: `feat/optional-agent-name`,
`docs/security-policy`, `chore/tighten-the-linter-set`.

- **Pull requests are merged by rebase.** Merge commits and squashing are both
  disabled, and each broke something: GitHub puts the conventional PR title into
  a merge commit, so release-please counted every change twice, and a squash
  collapses a pull request into one changelog line, losing the granularity that
  "one logical change per commit" exists to produce.
- **`CHANGELOG.md`, the tags and the version in `herdr-plugin.toml` belong to
  release-please.** Never edit one by hand.
- Keep a pull request to one thing. A refactor, a feature and a formatting sweep
  are three pull requests.

## Type rule (mandatory)

**A struct field exists only if code reads it.** Herdr's wire objects carry far
more than Auto Title needs; mirroring them in full makes a type claim a
dependency the code does not have, and every unread field is a promise to keep
something working that nothing exercises. Add a field when the code that reads
it lands in the same change, and delete a field the moment its last reader goes.
The same holds for methods, constants and event payload types.

## Script rule (mandatory)

**Everything in `scripts/` is Python 3 and uses the standard library only.**
Shell stays where it belongs: the one-line recipes in the Makefile. Anything
with a loop, a branch or a data structure is a Python script.

Two scripting languages in one repository means two sets of portability traps to
remember — `stat -f` against `stat -c`, `trap` against signal handlers, quoting
rules that differ per shell — for tooling nobody should have to think about.
Python was already here for the probes, so it is what the rest is written in.

Each script is executable, opens with `#!/usr/bin/env python3` and a module
docstring saying what it is for, and takes no dependency outside the standard
library.

## Comment rule (mandatory)

**A comment is at most three lines**, in every language in the repository, and
it says what is surprising rather than what is visible. A decision that needs a
paragraph goes in [docs/architecture](docs/architecture/), with one line in the
code pointing at it.

The rule in full, in Go terms and with worked examples of what to keep and what
to delete, is in [.claude/rules/comments.md](.claude/rules/comments.md).

## Commands

```sh
make            # list every target
make check      # fmt + vet + lint + test   ← the gate before any commit
make lint       # golangci-lint, pinned in tools/go.mod
make test       # go test -race ./...
make run        # build and run in the current Herdr session, DEBUG logging
make dev        # the same, restarting on every source change
make ps         # show running plugin/watcher instances
make stop       # stop them
make tabs       # current tab names
make watch-tabs # ...refreshed every second
make probe-snapshot # the session snapshot the plugin polls
```

`go test -race` is the gate, not `go test`: the state a poll carries between
polls is shared, two tests still run the loop in a goroutine of its own, and a
future reset action will touch that state from outside the loop.

The linter lives in `tools/go.mod`, a module of its own, so its dependency tree
stays out of the plugin's: the main module keeps two dependencies and still
builds on Go 1.24, which is what Herdr needs at install time. `errcheck` is off
— the places that swallow an error say why they do.

## Herdr socket API — the traps

The originating specification is wrong on several protocol details. Everything
here was verified against Herdr 0.8.2, protocol 20. **Probe before assuming
anything** (`make probe-*`, `scripts/probe.py`).

The facts in full — the measured costs, the field inventories, the event kinds,
what every object carries — are in
[docs/architecture/herdr-socket-api.md](docs/architecture/herdr-socket-api.md),
which is the record. **A probe that teaches something new goes there.** Below
are only the facts that would otherwise mislead the code in silence.

- **One request per connection.** Herdr closes the connection after answering,
  so every `Call` dials its own. That is why nothing here reconnects.
- **On Windows the socket is a named pipe**, `\\.\pipe\` followed by the whole
  of `HERDR_SOCKET_PATH`. The path itself names a small text file, and dialing
  it as a Unix socket is refused; `dial_windows.go` opens the pipe, and nothing
  else in the client differs.
- **On Windows `pane.process_info` lists only the pane's shell or a recognized
  agent**, never an editor, a build or an ssh session running under the shell.
  Names arrive with `.exe` and a process's `cwd` with a trailing backslash; the
  state package strips both as they arrive, so no reader of a pane sees either.
- Auto Title uses four methods and no others: `session.snapshot`,
  `pane.process_info`, `tab.rename` and `pane.rename`.
- **A pane carries no label until it has one, and an empty one clears it.**
  Herdr omits `label` from a pane object entirely until the pane is named, and
  `pane.rename` clears rather than stores an empty label — the opposite of
  `tab.rename`. So a pane has one unnamed spelling and a tab has two.
- **Do not reintroduce an event subscription.** `events.subscribe` replays
  about ten seconds of backlog per pane before anything live, with no cursor to
  skip it, so a subscriber opens by reacting to a session that is gone. A
  snapshot describes the present and costs less than the rename that follows it.
- **No single field is a pane's directory.** `cwd` is the pane's own shell,
  which a subshell leaves behind; `foreground_cwd` is the _deepest
  descendant's_, so anything a program starts elsewhere takes the pane with it.
  The directory is the foreground process's own `cwd`, which only
  `pane.process_info` reports.
- **A revision does not track what is running in a pane.** Measured, the
  foreground processes changed nine times while the revision moved four. A
  revision says the pane drew: a hint that a process read is due, never a
  promise that one is not.
- **`TabInfo.number` is not the label an unnamed tab carries.** Herdr labels an
  unnamed tab with its _position_, which slides down when a tab to its left
  closes, while `number` counts every tab the workspace has held and never
  repeats. Reading `number` as the label once locked every tab made after start.
- **An unnamed tab reports one of two labels**: its position, or the empty
  string `tab.rename` stores verbatim when given one. Code reading the label to
  mean "nobody named this" must accept either.
- **A tab label is one line.** `tab.rename` takes a newline and stores it
  verbatim, but the tab bar renders one row and Herdr exposes no height setting.
- **`PaneInfo.title` is the agent's own title, and is null in practice.** Claude
  Code reports its topic through `terminal_title_stripped` instead, and
  `agent_session` stays null until that agent's integration is installed.
- **A plugin the server starts inherits the server's environment**, not the
  shell of whoever installed it, which is why `HERDR_AUTO_TITLE_*` settings
  arrive through `config.env` (see
  [docs/architecture/configuration.md](docs/architecture/configuration.md)).
- **Herdr keeps no handle on a plugin it started.** A startup hook is spawned
  and forgotten: the server stops nothing when it stops, and runs the hooks
  again at every start and live handoff, so an instance that stayed would run
  beside its successor and lock the tabs the two name differently.
  `App.superseded` is what makes it leave instead; the loop must not survive
  a change of server (see
  [docs/architecture/poll-loop.md](docs/architecture/poll-loop.md)).

## Working here

- Work from the issue the change belongs to; [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)
  says when one is needed. If an issue turns out to rest on something false
  about Herdr, correct it there rather than silently working around it.
- Development runs against the user's real Herdr session, so **their tab names
  change while you work**. Run the plugin in the foreground, never in the
  background, and check `make ps` when something behaves oddly.
- **Decide from freshly read state.** Every poll reads the session and throws
  the result away again. What is carried between polls is only what a snapshot
  cannot say: when each pane last changed, what it was running when it was last
  asked — reused only until that pane's revision moves, and for no longer than
  `processRefresh` either way, because a revision does not track what runs in a
  pane — and how far each agent transcript has been read, because a transcript
  only grows and re-reading megabytes twice a second to find one new line would
  cost more than the rest of the loop together.
- **The code is the source of truth, then `docs/architecture`, then a comment.**
  A doc that contradicts the code is a bug in the doc, so fix it in the change
  that found it rather than leaving the next reader to rediscover the same
  thing.
- Never pass terminal-derived values to a shell. Renames go over the socket API.
- How the plugin works and why — the poll loop, title resolution, sanitizing
  untrusted values, manual rename protection — is in
  [docs/architecture](docs/architecture/). Record a design decision there rather
  than in the README, which is for people using the plugin.
- The full workflow is in [docs/development.md](docs/development.md);
  installation and configuration are in [README.md](README.md).
