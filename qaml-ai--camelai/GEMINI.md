# camelAI Agent Guide

Keep this file concise and durable. Add details here only when they help future agents navigate the repo or avoid common mistakes. Feature-specific behavior should usually live near the code or in tests.

## What This Is

camelAI is an AI coding assistant platform on Cloudflare Workers + Durable Objects with Cloudflare sandbox containers for builds/analysis. Users chat with persistent coding workspaces, run either Claude SDK or Codex app-server backed threads, and publish generated apps to `*.camelai.app` / environment-specific app hosts.

## High-Level Architecture

```text
React Router SSR + browser WS
        |
        v
Cloudflare main Worker + Durable Objects
        |
        v
Project files in WorkspaceFilesystemDO + R2 (do-r2 backend)
Builds/deploys + analysis in Cloudflare sandbox containers

Dispatcher Worker routes published user apps.
R2 stores uploads/assets/previews.
Cloudflare AI Gateway and BYOK credentials back model access.
```

Agent turns run in `ChatThreadDO` (Pi coding agent). Project source files live
in `WorkspaceFilesystemDO` + R2 (every project is `backend: "do-r2"`); builds,
deploys, and analysis run in Cloudflare sandbox containers (`ProjectBuildSandbox`,
`AnalysisSandbox`, `DbQuerySandbox`). The legacy Azure project-runtime-service VM
and its `PROJECT_RUNTIME_HOST` bridge are gone; the only remaining VM is the
static-IP database egress relay (`infra/db-egress-relay/`, see `docs/db-egress-relay.md`).
SQL queries/exports run in `DbQuerySandbox` (the `DATA_PROXY` binding is served
worker-side). There is no in-repo Go sandbox-host or data-proxy tree.

## Repository Map

- `src/` - React Router 7 app, routes, loaders/actions, UI components, shared server/client libraries.
- `src/routes.ts` - Imperative React Router route config. Add page/API routes here.
- `src/routes/api/` - React Router API routes for most user-facing REST (billing checkout, workspaces, chat groups, etc.).
- `src/components/ui/` - shadcn/ui components.
- `workers/main/` - Main Cloudflare Worker, Durable Objects, WebSocket routing, MCP, admin APIs, proxies, container image Dockerfiles.
- `workers/main/src/identity/` - `UserDO` / `OrgDO` and related identity helpers (`auth.ts` is a compatibility barrel).
- `workers/main/src/routes/` - Worker-native HTTP (WebSockets, Stripe webhook, data-proxy, MCP, most `/api/admin/*` on Hono). Prefer documenting new paths here vs `src/routes/api/` — see **API routing** below.
- `workers/dispatcher/` - Workers for Platforms dispatcher for deployed user apps.
- `workers/app-usage-guard/` - Account-wide Durable Object SQLite usage monitor and reversible app quarantine Worker; see `docs/deployed-app-usage-guard-design.md`.
- `workers/bedrock-provider/` - AI Gateway custom provider translating Anthropic-style requests to Bedrock.
- `workers/user-logs-tail/` - Tail worker for deployed app logs.
- `workers/e2e-reports/` - Public viewer at `e2e-reports.camelai.dev` serving Playwright E2E reports from R2 (uploaded by the E2E workflow); deploy with `bun run deploy:e2e-reports`.
- `workers/eval-reports/` - Read-only results store + viewer for agent evals at `evals.camelai.dev` (evals run locally; `EVAL_REPORT=1` publishes them); deploy with `bun run deploy:eval-reports`.
- The Go data-proxy (external `qaml-ai/project-runtime-service` `cmd/data-proxy`) is **retired**: SQL queries and warehouse exports now run in the `DbQuerySandbox` Cloudflare container (`workers/main/src/db-query-service.ts` + `data-proxy.ts` compat surface), and the `SANDBOX_HOST` VPC binding is gone. Do not reintroduce either. Decommission checklist: `docs/db-egress-relay.md`.
- `sandbox/` - Agent skills, project scaffold templates (`create-worker/`), and the canonical `validate-notebook.py` (byte-copied into `workers/main/analysis-sandbox-assets/` for the analysis image build context). Not the agent control plane or harness — those live in `workers/main` (`chat-thread-do.ts`, Pi tools, Dockerfiles).
- `scripts/` - Deploy, eval, self-host, and maintenance scripts. One-off migrations (`migrate-to-workspaces.ts`, `import-legacy-emails.ts`) are break-glass only.
- `docs/` - Supporting documentation; see `docs/README.md` for the canonical index (many `*-plan.md` / feedback files are historical).
- `plans/` - Active cross-cutting architecture plans (e.g. OrgDO split, no-VM build/deploy).
- `infra/` - Terraform for the static-IP database egress relay VM (`infra/db-egress-relay/`); `infra/selfhost/` for self-host cloud templates. See `infra/README.md`.
- `tests/` - Vitest UI / `src/lib` unit tests (`vitest.config.ts`).
- `workers/main/tests/` - Worker / Durable Object / Miniflare tests + `evals/` (`vitest.workers.config.ts`).
- `e2e/` - Playwright end-to-end specs.
- `.claude/skills/` - Agent skills for this repo (evals, shadcn, writing skills).

### API routing

Two HTTP surfaces share the main worker:

| Surface | Location | Typical contents |
| --- | --- | --- |
| React Router | `src/routes/api/` | Session-cookie user REST (workspaces, billing checkout, uploads, chat groups) |
| Worker-native | `workers/main/src/routes/` | WebSockets, Stripe webhook, MCP, data-proxy, most bearer admin REST |

`workers/main/src/index.ts` routes some paths (e.g. `/api/admin/*`) to worker modules before React Router SSR. When adding an API, match an existing neighbor; do not invent a third pattern.

### Internal vs product names

Product name is **camelAI**. Internal Cloudflare resources, DO/MCP class names, headers, and Analytics Engine datasets often still use legacy internal codenames (for example the `/qaml-backdoor` superuser UI and the `*_observability_*` / `*_errors_*` dataset prefixes). Prefer the existing name in code; do not rename bindings or exported DO classes casually.

## Development Commands

Use Bun for JS commands.

```bash
bun run dev                 # React Router dev with Cloudflare bindings, default localhost:3001
bun run build               # Production React Router build
bun run typecheck           # Generate route types, then tsc
bun run lint                # ESLint
bun run test                # Vitest watch mode
bun run test:run            # Vitest run once
bun run test:workers        # Worker/Miniflare tests
bun run test:all            # Unit + worker tests
bun run test:e2e            # Playwright
```

The bundled shadcn/ui catalog served by `add_shadcn_component` and the scaffold's seeded
primitives live in `workers/main/src/shadcn-registry.generated.ts`; refresh it from the public
registry with `bun scripts/generate-shadcn-registry.mjs` (also update
`workers/main/project-build-sandbox-warmup/package.json` — `tests/project-scaffold-warmup.test.ts`
enforces the sync so the build-sandbox image keeps all installable packages in its bun cache).

Common deploy commands:

```bash
bun run deploy:main:prod
bun run deploy:main:staging
bun run deploy:dispatcher:prod
bun run deploy:dispatcher:staging
bun run deploy:dispatcher:evals       # testing-grounds dispatcher for real-deploy evals
bun run deploy:usage-guard:prod
bun run deploy:usage-guard:staging
bun run deploy:bedrock-provider:prod
```

### Real-deploy evals (testing grounds)

Agent evals deploy apps for real to a dedicated testing-grounds namespace so they are
actually usable. The eval sandbox runs inside Miniflare, so `eval-sandbox.ts` intercepts the
container's Cloudflare API traffic and forwards it to the production `proxyCloudflareApi`
in-process (identity via `trustedIdentity` from the per-container eval deploy context in
`eval-deploy-context.ts`). The deploy then publishes to the `chiridion-platform-evals`
dispatch namespace and registers in OrgDO exactly like production — so `list_apps` /
`set_preview` and `AgentEvalSessionResult.deployedApps` surface the app through the normal
app path with no eval-specific branches in `mcp-handler`/`chat-thread-do`. The testing-grounds
host comes from the eval env's `WORKER_BASE_URL` / `LOCAL_APP_VANITY_DOMAIN`
(`*.evals.camelai.app`), and virtual bindings resolve against the staging main worker
(`CF_WORKER_NAME`); these are pinned in `wrangler.test.jsonc`. Real deploy is the default for
agent eval runs whenever `CF_API_TOKEN` is set; `EVAL_REAL_DEPLOY=0` disables it (deploy evals
then skip). Served by the evals dispatcher (`workers/dispatcher/wrangler.evals.jsonc`); the
namespace + DNS routes are created out-of-band. Eval apps are kept (no cleanup). Live-data
bindings (`DATA_PROXY`/`CONNECTIONS`) won't resolve to the eval's local workspace;
self-contained apps render fully.

### Eval results viewer (`workers/eval-reports/`)

Agent evals **run locally** (they need Docker + `.dev.vars`; Miniflare spawns the eval sandbox
containers via the local Docker daemon): `bun run test:eval <id>` (or the `:dashboard` / `:deploy`
/ `:sandbox` shortcuts) wraps `scripts/run-agent-eval.mjs`; `scripts/run-eval-suite.sh` runs a
list/`all`. There is no remote runner — the retired `qaml-ai/camelai-eval-runner` VM control plane
was replaced by a shared results store + read-only viewer on Cloudflare (`workers/eval-reports/`,
`evals.camelai.dev`: Worker + R2, everything behind Cloudflare Access, no worker secrets).

Set `EVAL_REPORT=1` on a run to publish it there when it finishes: `run-agent-eval.mjs` captures
the output log and invokes `scripts/report-eval-run.mjs`, which uploads the transcript artifact +
log and posts metadata (auth via an Access service token in `CF_ACCESS_CLIENT_ID/SECRET`, or a
local `cloudflared access login`). Use the **`running-agent-evals`** skill for the run/report/read
workflows; the always-current API doc is served at `GET evals.camelai.dev/skill`. Deploy the
viewer with `bun run deploy:eval-reports`; see `workers/eval-reports/README.md`.
Suite and matrix runs share an `EVAL_BATCH_ID`, and the viewer groups those reported runs into
batches.

**Adding a new eval.** `workers/main/tests/evals/manifest.json` is the single source of truth for the
committed eval list. To add one: (1) create `workers/main/tests/evals/<id>.test.ts`, gated on
`RUN_AGENT_EVALS === "1"`, ending in `emitEvalTranscript({...})` from `./eval-transcript` (every eval
shares one transcript marker pair); (2) add a `{ "id", "description", "kind", "realDeploy"? }` entry to
`manifest.json`. It is then runnable via `bun run test:eval <id>` and included in `EVAL_TARGET=all` —
no other files to edit. `custom-prompt-live` is intentionally not in the manifest (it's the generic
`CUSTOM_EVAL_*`-driven harness). `run-agent-eval.mjs` runs exactly one eval; `run-eval-suite.sh`
iterates a comma-separated list or `all`, running each eval in turn.

**Apple Silicon: build the analysis sandbox natively.** Cloudflare publishes `cloudflare/sandbox`
images for amd64 only; under Rosetta/QEMU the Jupyter kernel never answers its handshake, so
`run_notebook` (and every notebook eval) fails on arm64 hosts. `scripts/build-analysis-sandbox-image.mjs`
builds the pinned sandbox base from source for the host arch and layers the analysis image on top;
`run-agent-eval.mjs` and `run-eval-suite.sh` invoke it automatically (it also rebuilds when the
cached image arch doesn't match the host, or when the analysis Dockerfile / baked assets under
`workers/main/analysis-sandbox-assets/` changed — a content hash is stamped on the image as a label).

**Container egress workaround (workerd#6793).** Evals run the agent in a Cloudflare Container via
`@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers`/Miniflare. On newer hosts (Linux kernel ~6.17 / Docker 29.x) the
stock `cloudflare/proxy-everything` egress sidecar's TPROXY rules intercept docker bridge *control*
traffic, so the container never becomes ready and evals fail with `kj/timer ... operation timed out`
/ "Container failed to start". `workers/main/eval-egress-fix/` is a thin wrapper image that adds a
bridge-bypass rule; `run-eval-suite.sh` builds it and `run-agent-eval.mjs` auto-selects it via
`MINIFLARE_CONTAINER_EGRESS_IMAGE` (both no-ops where the bug doesn't trigger). Such hosts also need
the docker bridge allowed to reach the host (e.g. `ufw allow in on docker0`). Remove the wrapper
once cloudflare/workerd#6794 ships in a release.

Separately, vitest-pool-workers leaves the eval container + sidecar running after each run
(workers-sdk#14242); they accumulate and exhaust the host. `run-agent-eval.mjs` prunes leftover
`EvalSandbox` containers before/after each run. The sweep is global, so it's only safe when one
eval runs at a time (the normal local case); an orchestrator that runs evals concurrently must set
`EVAL_MANAGED_CLEANUP=1` to skip it and own cleanup itself.

## Frontend Conventions

- React Router is in framework mode. Prefer `loader`, `action`, `<Form>`, and `useFetcher` over client-only fetching in `useEffect`.
- Route definitions live in `src/routes.ts`; route modules live in `src/routes/`.
- Tailwind CSS v4 and shadcn/ui are the default UI stack.
- For UI work, use the `shadcn-components` skill and existing primitives in `src/components/ui/`.
- Use `cn()` from `@/lib/utils` for class composition.
- Use Lucide icons where appropriate.
- Keep app surfaces work-focused and dense. Avoid marketing-style pages unless the task explicitly asks for one.

## Worker And Durable Object Conventions

Important DOs and runtime classes live primarily in `workers/main/src/`:

- `identity/` (`auth.ts` barrel) - `UserDO`, `OrgDO`, and identity helpers. OrgDO domain extraction is in progress (`plans/split-auth-durable-objects.md`); prefer new org logic in `identity/org/` modules rather than growing `org-do.ts`.
- `workspace.ts` - `WorkspaceDO`, workspace metadata, integration state, token refresh alarms.
- `chat-thread-do.ts` - `ChatThreadDO` compatibility façade and chat WebSocket/turn orchestration. Focused collaborators live in `chat-thread/` (Pi persistence, model/tool setup, UI mirroring, recovery journals, verified completion evidence, metadata, preview/access/automation, and streaming activity); verify this surface with `bun run test:workers -- chat-thread`.
- `workspace-cron.ts` - `WorkspaceCronDO`, scheduled prompt storage and dispatch.
- `worker-logs-do.ts` - `WorkerLogsDO`, deployed app log tail/streaming (in-memory ring buffer; not SQLite-persisted).
- `admin-index-do.ts` - `AdminIndexDO`, admin indexes and dashboard-style aggregates.
- `org-slug-registry.ts` - `OrgSlugDO`, atomic org slug ownership.
- `email-handle-registry.ts` - `EmailHandleDO`, email handle ownership.
- `mcp-handler.ts` - Internal MCP agent/tools.
- `*-mcp.ts` / `connections-runtime.ts` - Per-provider connection MCP wrappers and shared connection runtime (candidate for an `integrations/` folder).
- `observability.ts` - Shared Cloudflare Analytics Engine event/error writer. New structured instrumentation should go through this helper instead of calling `writeDataPoint` directly.
- `lake-streams.ts` + `chat-thread/transcript-lake.ts` - Transcript / tool-call export to Iceberg tables in R2 Data Catalog via Cloudflare Pipelines. Both bindings are optional and every helper no-ops without them, so dev/tests/self-host never export. Tool durations are measured live (Pi records no tool start timestamp) and stamped as `uiMetadata.toolDurationMs`. Design, setup commands, and the privacy posture: `config/pipelines/README.md`. Verify with `bun run test:workers -- transcript-lake`.

Durable Objects use SQLite-backed storage. Prefer:

```ts
this.ctx.storage.sql.exec("SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ?", id);
this.ctx.storage.kv.put("key", value);
const value = this.ctx.storage.kv.get("key");
```

Do not use legacy async DO storage (`await ctx.storage.get/put`) in new code. Do not use module-level mutable `Map`, `Set`, or singleton instance caches in Worker code; isolate reuse can leak stale state across requests.

For background work in Workers, import `waitUntil` from `cloudflare:workers` and catch/log failures:

```ts
import { waitUntil } from "cloudflare:workers";

waitUntil(
  task().catch((error) => console.error("Background task failed", error)),
);
```

## Observability

- Cloudflare Workers Observability and source-map uploads are enabled in deployed Wrangler configs.
- Structured operational events go to `OBSERVABILITY_EVENTS`; structured errors are mirrored through `ERROR_ANALYTICS`. Use `recordObservabilityEvent` / `recordErrorEvent` from `workers/main/src/observability.ts` for new instrumentation.
- Keep observability payloads diagnostic but not transcript-like: include ids, counts, status, durations, routes, and error metadata; do not store chat message contents, secrets, request bodies, or auth headers. The one deliberate exception is the transcript data lake (`config/pipelines/README.md`), which exports transcript text on purpose and is governed by its own access/retention rules — it is not a licence to widen Analytics Engine payloads.
- The main app workers attach Tail Consumers to `workers/user-logs-tail/`, which forwards raw Worker trace/log/exception events into `WorkerLogsDO`.
- Production datasets are `chiridion_observability_prod` and `chiridion_errors_prod`; staging uses the corresponding `_staging` datasets. Verify bindings in the environment-specific `wrangler*.jsonc` files before changing collection paths.
- Query Analytics Engine through Cloudflare's SQL API with an account token that has Account Analytics Read. The account id is `CF_ACCOUNT_ID` in Wrangler vars. Example:

```bash
curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/$CF_ACCOUNT_ID/analytics_engine/sql" \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer $CF_API_TOKEN" \
  --data "SELECT timestamp, blob1 AS event, blob3 AS component, blob5 AS status, blob9 AS thread_id, double2 AS duration_ms FROM chiridion_observability_staging WHERE timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '1' HOUR ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 100 FORMAT JSON"
```

- `OBSERVABILITY_EVENTS` schema: `blob1 event`, `blob2 severity`, `blob3 component`, `blob4 operation`, `blob5 status`, `blob6 route`, `blob7 method`, `blob8 path`, `blob9 threadId`, `blob10 workspaceId`, `blob11 orgId`, `blob12 userId`, `blob13 requestId`, `blob14 provider`, `blob15 model`, `blob16 errorName`, `blob17 errorMessage`, `blob18 errorStack`; `double1 timestamp_ms`, `double2 duration_ms`, `double3 status_code`, `double4 count`, `double5 size`; `index1 sample key`.
- `ERROR_ANALYTICS` has the error-focused subset: `blob1 event`, `blob2 component`, `blob3 operation`, `blob4 status`, `blob5 errorName`, `blob6 errorMessage`, `blob7 threadId`, `blob8 workspaceId`, `blob9 orgId`, `blob10 userId`, `blob11 requestId`, `blob12 route`, `blob13 path`, `blob14 errorStack`; doubles match the same timestamp/duration/status/count/size order.
- For aggregate counts/sums, account for sampling with `_sample_interval`, for example `SUM(_sample_interval)` instead of `COUNT()`.

## Chat And Runtime Flow

- Browser chat connects to `/ws/{workspace}`.
- The main worker validates access and routes to `ChatThreadDO`.
- `ChatThreadDO` runs the Pi coding agent in the Durable Object. Project file operations go to `WorkspaceFilesystemDO` + R2 (`do-r2` backend); builds/deploys/analysis run in Cloudflare sandbox containers. There is no shell/`bash` tool — the agent uses the DO-backed file tools plus `deploy_project`/`add_dependency` and `js_exec`. `deploy_project` builds, publishes, returns the live URL, and opens preview; no manual `set_preview` is needed, though the tool remains available for explicit preview switches. `run_notebook` likewise opens a clean successful notebook run in preview automatically and leaves preview unchanged on failure. `dry_run: true` validates a deploy without publishing. `build_project` is only a hidden compatibility alias.
- Transport + render history are owned by `@cloudflare/ai-chat` (`ChatThreadDO extends AIChatAgent`). A turn is a resumable UIMessage stream: `onChatMessage` runs the Pi prompt (or the recovery/resume branch) and relays Pi runtime events through the encoder as native UIMessage chunks; `chatRecovery` owns bounded re-drives of an interrupted turn and `chatStreamStallTimeoutMs` bounds a stalled turn (its stream-cancel disposes the hung Pi session and routes the turn into recovery). The client renders from `useAgentChat` (`resume: true`); no bespoke websocket transcript fan-out.
- Two message stores: **`pi_core_*`** tables are Pi's model-side transcript (authoritative for the agent and repair/eval tooling); the **ai-chat message table** is the browser render history. A high-water-mark backfill (`topUpUiMessagesFromPiCore` / `getUiMessages` RPC) mirrors new pi_core rows into render history. Same-content-same-id invariant: every pi_core row is stamped with the render message id it streams into (`uiMetadata.renderMessageId` — turnId for assistant rows, the persisted skeleton's id for user rows), so the mirror is an idempotent upsert and a whole turn folds into the one live message id. The chat-route loader calls `getUiMessages` for cold load only; live sync rides the stream + CHAT_MESSAGES broadcasts. See `docs/chat-transcript-simplification.md` for the invariants and the derive-on-read roadmap.
- The Pi event → UIMessage chunk encoder is `src/lib/pi-chunk-encoder.ts`; the UIMessage → legacy `Message` render adapter (both directions) is `src/lib/ui-message-adapter.ts`. Steering appends via RPC + `persistMessages`. The Agent-state payload (`src/lib/chat-agent-state.ts`, shared DO/client) now carries only coarse fields (preview, todos, title, model, terminal error) — streaming and turn duration/completion are derived from the hook + `message-metadata.pi`.
- Client seed/stream ownership seam: on a tab switch, the snapshot-derived `useAgentChat` seed EXCLUDES the mid-stream assistant message (`resolveDisplayChatData`); the resumed stream rebuilds it from scratch and Chat bridges the paint gap (`bridgedStreamingMessageId`). Don't reintroduce hydrated in-flight content into the seed — replay onto it duplicates parts (upstream `ai`/`agents` merge is replace-last-or-push).
- Thread records store provider/model state on org thread data. Verify current fields in `OrgDO` before changing related behavior.
- Slash commands are allowlisted in `ChatThreadDO`; check `SLASH_COMMANDS` before adding or changing one.
- Clarifying questions use the Pi `AskUserQuestion`/`ask_user_question` tools.

### Adding a new chat model

When adding a new model (Claude, OpenAI, OpenRouter), follow the checklist at
the top of `src/lib/model-catalog.ts`. The picker, pricing, and harness routing
live in separate files, and the catalog tests fail if any of them drift apart.

## Uploads, Files, And Safety

- Chat uploads use multipart R2 upload APIs under `/api/workspaces/:id/upload`.
- Workspace file API routes live under `/api/workspaces/:id/fs/*`.
- File safety logic lives in `workers/main/src/file-safety.ts` and is applied before agent turns for suspicious uploaded-file/deploy/bridge workflows.
- The Pi system prompt is assembled in `workers/main/src/chat-thread-do.ts`; keep security-relevant prompt changes explicit and tested.

## Proxies And Bindings

- Sandbox containers do not get a generic Worker API proxy. File, shell, and runtime operations go through explicit project-runtime / host control-plane APIs.
- BYOK credentials are scoped by org/thread and should not be placed into container environment variables.
- User app deploys can rewrite internal service bindings such as the data proxy, virtual AI binding, and virtual R2 bucket. Relevant files include `workers/main/src/cf-api-proxy.ts`, `data-proxy-service.ts`, `ai-virtual-binding.ts`, and `r2-virtual-bucket.ts`.
- Outbound database traffic egresses from the sandbox host VM IP `20.46.233.68` (surfaced in direct database connection setup UIs for firewall/VPC allowlisting; constant in `src/lib/sandbox-network.ts`).
- `DbQuerySandbox` (Cloudflare sandbox container, no user code) is THE SQL query/export path — the connection MCP, the `DATA_PROXY` user-app binding, and the sandbox container routes all go through the legacy-contract surface in `workers/main/src/data-proxy.ts` → `db-query-compat.ts` → `db-query-service.ts`. It keeps the static-IP guarantee by dialing databases through a SOCKS relay on the sandbox host VM (`infra/db-egress-relay/`; design + smoke + decommission checklist in `docs/db-egress-relay.md`); with no relay configured it dials from the container's own IP. The query logic is shipped from the worker per call (not baked): the runner `workers/main/db-query-sandbox-assets/runner/db-query-runner.mjs` is embedded through the `virtual:db-query-runner-source` alias (Vite `?raw` for the main worker, Wrangler `Text` for dispatchers) and piped into node over stdin in one stateless exec; exports write Parquet straight into the workspace's mounted warehouse R2 prefix. Keep the SSRF denylists in that runner and `infra/db-egress-relay/gost.yaml.example` in sync.

## Stripe Billing And Credits

- Org billing state lives on `org_info` JSON. Key fields include `billing_status`, Stripe customer/subscription ids, purchased credit cents, included/granted credit cents, trial credit grant metadata, and the last included-credit invoice id.
- Hosted model access is enforced in the Worker/DO inference path. Hosted `trialing` and `active` usage requires positive included/purchased credits; BYOK can be used from the free onboarding path and does not consume camelAI credits; `enterprise` bypasses Stripe subscription and credits.
- Hosted credit allowances come from `src/lib/billing-plans.ts`: Starter includes $10/month, Pro includes $40/month, and Team includes $50/month per paid seat. `BILLING_TRIAL_CREDIT_CENTS` and `BILLING_SUBSCRIPTION_INCLUDED_CREDIT_CENTS` are global emergency overrides; do not set them for normal tier-specific pricing.
- Admins can grant credits manually with `POST /api/admin/orgs/:id/credits`; credits add to `billing_credit_grant_total_cents` and can use an idempotency key.
- `STRIPE_MODE` can be set to `test` or `live`; Stripe API calls reject secret keys whose `sk_`/`rk_` prefix does not match. Staging should use `STRIPE_MODE=test`, and production should use `STRIPE_MODE=live`.
- Stripe webhooks land on `POST /api/billing/stripe/webhook`. Subscription events sync status and grant the one-time trial cap; `invoice.payment_succeeded` grants recurring included credits idempotently; credit checkout sessions increment purchased credits.
- Credit balance is purchased credits plus included/granted credits minus sandbox-host usage rows marked `credit_chargeable = 1`.

## Auth, Onboarding, And Admin

- Session/auth helpers are split between app-side loaders/actions in `src/lib/` and Worker-side helpers in `workers/main/src/helpers/`.
- Reverse-proxy identity providers (auto-login behind Cloudflare Access or Pomerium) share one engine in `workers/main/src/helpers/proxy-auth-core.ts` (JWT verify, JWKS, org mapping, revalidation); per-provider adapters are `access-session.ts` (RS256, get-identity endpoint) and `pomerium-session.ts` (ES256, inline-group claims). The registry/dispatcher is `proxy-auth-providers.ts`; app-side silent login/provisioning is `src/lib/proxy-auth.server.ts`. To add a provider, implement `ProxyAuthProvider` and register it. Tests: `tests/{pomerium,cloudflare-access}-*.test.ts`. Docs: `docs/pomerium-auth.md`, `docs/cloudflare-access-auth.md`.
- Password auth, OAuth account creation, email verification, onboarding, bans, and blocked signup policies all have tests in `workers/main/tests/`; update or add focused tests when touching these flows.
- First-touch marketing attribution and the durable first-accepted-message definition of `new_camel_activation` are documented in `MARKETING_ATTRIBUTION.md`.
- Superuser UI routes live under `/qaml-backdoor`.
- Bearer-auth admin APIs live under `/api/admin/*`; implementation is in `workers/main/src/routes/admin/` and related route modules in `src/routes/api/`.
- Admin MCP is served at `/api/admin/mcp` (`https://staging.camelai.dev/api/admin/mcp` in staging) and uses OAuth scope `admin:mcp`. Staging is also behind Cloudflare Access; pass `CF-Access-Token: $(cloudflared access token -app=https://staging.camelai.dev)` when connecting with `mcporter`. If an MCP client opens an authorize URL with `scope=openid+email+profile`, the flow will fail with `invalid_scope`; force `admin:mcp` with `oauthScope` or a pre-registered static OAuth client.
- `admin_js_exec` is the generic superuser remote Worker console for staging/production (binding RPC/fetch, Durable Objects, admin/self/outbound HTTP, assertions, and checked-in smoke suites). See `docs/admin-js-exec.md`; primitive env values and secrets are intentionally non-readable.
- A reliable staging smoke path for admin MCP is: register or provide an OAuth client for the chosen localhost callback with `scope: "admin:mcp"`, set `ACCESS_TOKEN=$(cloudflared access token -app=https://staging.camelai.dev)`, then add a private `mcporter` config entry with `baseUrl: "https://staging.camelai.dev/api/admin/mcp"`, `auth: "oauth"`, `oauthScope: "admin:mcp"`, and `headers: { "CF-Access-Token": "$env:ACCESS_TOKEN" }`. Run `npx mcporter auth <server-name>` followed by `npx mcporter list <server-name> --json`. The browser session must be a camelAI superuser, otherwise authorization fails with `Admin access required`.
- Admin and moderation flows often involve durable tombstones in KV plus destructive cleanup. Avoid changing ordering without tests.

## Integrations And Ingress

- Slack ingress starts in `workers/main/src/slack-events-queue.ts` and routes turns into `ChatThreadDO`.
- Email ingress starts in `workers/main/src/email-ingress.ts`; workspace addresses are subaddressed by org/workspace slug.
- Local Email Worker ingress can be simulated with `POST /cdn-cgi/handler/email` on the local dev server, passing `from` and `to` query params plus a raw RFC 822-style body. Real MX-routed inbound email always reaches the deployed Worker route, not localhost.
- Local outbound email uses the `send_email` binding from Wrangler config. For agent email, sender addresses must resolve to workspace email handles on `WORKSPACE_EMAIL_DOMAIN`; do not fall back to `EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS`/`no-reply` for agent sends.
- OAuth integration code is split across `workers/main/src/services/oauth.ts`, route files, and workspace integration storage. Admin MCP OAuth is implemented separately in `workers/main/src/admin-mcp-oauth.ts`.
- Imported API definitions, typed operation policies, generic HTTP fallback, and GA4 behavior are documented in `docs/integrations-runtime.md`; use `docs/connections-improvement-guide.md` for the living UX, quality, safety, and evaluation strategy.
- Scheduled prompts are owned by `WorkspaceCronDO` and exposed through MCP tools.

## Project Runtime

- Projects are DO+R2 backed (`backend: "do-r2"`): metadata and source files live in `WorkspaceFilesystemDO` (`ProjectFilesystemClient` for per-project files), with Cloudflare Artifacts git history. The `WorkspaceProjectBackend` type still carries archived legacy `"vm"` rows (their files are gone; project/file tools return an "archived when camelAI retired project VMs" error for them).
- Builds/deploys run in `ProjectBuildSandbox` (`project-build-service.ts`); notebook analysis in `AnalysisSandbox`; SQL in `DbQuerySandbox`.
- The legacy Azure `project-runtime-service` VM, its `PROJECT_RUNTIME_HOST` bridge, the VM `bash`/`vm_exec`/`clone_project` tools, and all their deploy/dev/migration scripts have been removed. The only remaining VM is the static-IP database egress relay (`infra/db-egress-relay/`). Do not reintroduce a project VM runtime.

## Testing Guidance

- Place tests next to the surface they cover:
  - `tests/` — React Router UI, `src/lib`, and other non-worker unit tests (`bun run test` / `test:run`).
  - `workers/main/tests/` — Worker, Durable Object, and Miniflare tests (`bun run test:workers`). Agent evals live in `workers/main/tests/evals/`.
  - `e2e/` — Playwright (`bun run test:e2e`).
- For UI route/component changes, run at least `bun run typecheck` and the most relevant Vitest test(s).
- For Worker/DO behavior, prefer focused `bun run test:workers -- <test-file>` or `bun run test:workers` when the surface is shared.
- For changes crossing browser chat, worker routing, and project runtime behavior, test the smallest representative path plus typecheck.
- Add tests when changing auth, billing/usage, admin purge/ban behavior, proxy auth, file safety, or persistence semantics.
- `sandbox/validate-notebook.py` is canonical; `workers/main/analysis-sandbox-assets/validate-notebook.py` must stay byte-identical (`tests/analysis-sandbox-asset-drift.test.ts`).

## Error Handling Culture

- Prefer failing loudly and early over silently swallowing errors or falling back to unclear behavior. Hidden failures make production bugs much harder to debug.
- Only add fallbacks when they preserve a clearly defined user experience and still expose enough signal through errors, logs, or tests to diagnose the original failure.
- Do not convert unexpected persistence, auth, upload, billing, or runtime/tool failures into empty data unless the caller explicitly treats "not found" as a valid state.

## Local Environment Notes

Minimal prerequisites: Node.js 22+, Bun, Tailscale, and Cloudflare credentials for deployed/bound services.

Common local secret/config files:

- `.dev.vars` for Worker/dev secrets.
- `wrangler*.jsonc` for environment-specific Cloudflare config.
Useful local variables include `CF_GATEWAY_TOKEN`, OAuth client IDs/secrets, `INTEGRATION_SECRET_KEY`, `TOKEN_SIGNING_SECRET`, and email provider settings.

For exe.dev-specific admin MCP setup with mcporter, see `docs/exedev-admin-mcp.md`.

### SSH to shared hosts

Use Tailscale SSH as user `chiridion`; do not rely on shared private keys for normal access:

```bash
tailscale ssh chiridion@chiridion-sandbox-staging
tailscale ssh chiridion@chiridion-sandbox-prod
```

Tailscale host IPs are staging `100.115.221.105` and prod `100.112.135.2`. Public SSH ingress should remain closed except temporary break-glass access.

## Maintenance Rules

- Keep this guide short. Prefer pointers to files and tests over duplicating implementation details.
- When adding a major subsystem, add a short map entry and the canonical test command.
- When removing or renaming a subsystem, update this file in the same change.
- If a detail is likely to drift quickly, document where to verify it instead of freezing it here.
