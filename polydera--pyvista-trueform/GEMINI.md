# pyvista-trueform agent contract

This package is a boundary and nothing more: PyVista datasets in, trueform
results out — about 2,800 lines under `src/`, of which some 1,100 are code
and the rest is the contract each entry states. trueform owns every
computation; PyVista owns every dataset. Work here is judged by whether the
boundary stays this thin.

Developed jointly by Žiga Sajovic and Claude.

## The laws

1. **The cache is whole-value.** The accessor caches one `trueform.Mesh`
   per dataset, keyed by the dataset's VTK MTime — one integer compare per
   access. While the MTime holds, every call reuses the same instance, so
   trueform's lazily built structures (tree, face membership, edge link)
   amortize. When it changes, the mesh is discarded whole and rebuilt.
   Never partial refresh, never per-array owners, never storage tracking —
   that design was considered and rejected as overengineering. The volume
   accessor on `pyvista.ImageData` holds one `trueform.Volume` under the
   same law, keyed by MTime and the array read — the array, never the
   spelling of the request; there the cache also buys the sample copy the
   conversion owes. What advances an MTime is the same on both carriers
   and is a fact about the array, not the dataset: a VTK-backed array
   notifies its owner, a plain NumPy buffer does not. So a sample edited
   through the dataset rebuilds the volume by itself, and a write to a
   buffer VTK is only borrowing — the one `volume_to_pyvista` shares —
   needs `Modified()`.

2. **Conversion direction decides copying.** `to_trueform` and
   `volume_to_trueform` copy — the result is detached from the dataset by
   contract. `to_pyvista`, `curves_to_pyvista` and `volume_to_pyvista` are
   zero-copy: trueform's offset-block layout IS VTK 9's cell-array layout,
   a volume's samples ARE VTK's flat x-fastest point data, and VTK retains
   the NumPy buffers. The one exception is a baked `trueform.Mesh`
   transformation, which must copy points; nothing else may quietly copy
   or quietly alias. A `trueform.Volume` pose is never baked — the grid
   carries it as origin + spacing + direction, which is why that direction
   stays zero-copy even when posed, and the pose is a turn about the
   dataset's own origin so that crossing never redefines the coordinates a
   caller already holds.

3. **Nothing is rederived.** This package never computes geometry,
   topology, or labels — it converts, forwards to trueform's public Python
   API, and converts back. Labels ride verbatim as cell data. If an
   operation needs a fact, trueform produces it.

4. **The boundary is loud.** Types, dtypes, and shapes are validated at
   entry with exact error messages. No silent coercion, and no silent
   feature loss: a dependency floor is a feature floor (the pyvista floor
   is the version whose accessor registry this package registers into).

5. **The package speaks two dialects, one per direction.** Inward,
   queries speak trueform primitives: `ray_cast` and `pick` take a
   `tf.Ray` (single or batch), a point query is an array or a batched
   `tf.Point` — a points-only PyVista dataset wraps its `.points` as one
   batched primitive, never a refusal, never a second path. Outward,
   readers answer in PyVista types: `PolyData` with labels as cell data,
   `MultiBlock` for anything plural, line PolyData for curves, `ImageData`
   for a scalar field — the `CsgGraph` wrapper exists for exactly this,
   with `.native` as the one escape hatch. And every value this package
   names "distance" is euclidean; a squared metric is converted at the
   boundary, once.

6. **Every claim is a fixture.** Cache identity (`is`), the raw-mutation
   MTime gotcha, zero-copy owner-safety under `gc`, entry-point
   registration in a clean subprocess — each documented behavior has the
   test that proves it, in `tests/test_pyvista_trueform.py`.

## Boundaries with the neighbors

- trueform's Python surface is the only trueform this package sees. Never
  reach into its internals; its own contract lives in the trueform
  repository (`agents/python_layer.md`).
- PyVista is reached through its public API plus the VTK cell-array/
  numpy_support seam used by the conversions. Accessor registration goes
  through `pyvista.register_dataset_accessor` and the `pyvista.accessors`
  entry point — both, so `import pyvista_trueform` and a bare
  `import pyvista` reach the same accessor.
- What PyVista already does well stays PyVista's: plain normals
  (`compute_normals`), smoothing (`smooth`, `smooth_taubin`), and IO
  passthroughs beyond `read`/`write` are its idioms, and this package
  does not shadow them — a binding earns its place only where trueform
  produces the fact. `image.trueform.isosurface()` is not a second
  `contour()`: it is where dual contouring, the welded indexed output,
  and the grid's own pose come from.
- PyVista owns a dataset's placement, so the volume conversions hand it
  back its own vocabulary: the composed placement goes to
  `index_to_physical_matrix`, and PyVista's decomposition — including
  its shear refusal — is the one producer of `origin`, `spacing` and
  `direction_matrix`. This package never decomposes a matrix itself.

## Working here

- The package is installed editable, so edits are live; the gate is
  `python -m pytest tests` (~1 s) after every change, plus
  `PYVISTA_OFF_SCREEN=true python examples/<name>.py` for any example
  touched — every `main()` must exit clean headless.
- Every example's `compute()` is also a fixture: the suite runs each one
  and checks what it claims. The volume surface's four are
  `examples/volume_scan.py` (a NIfTI study surfaced in patient space),
  `volume_csg.py` (a field carve read by both extractors),
  `volume_offset.py` (a banded mesh field at three offsets) and
  `volume_slice.py` (level sets on a plane beside their isosurface).
- Verify every trueform signature against the installed wheel or
  /Users/ziga/trueform/python/src/trueform/ BEFORE calling it; never
  guess a kwarg or a return shape. Run the call live before writing its
  test.
- Commits: house conventional style (`feat(scope): lowercase declarative`),
  one concern per commit, tests land with the feature they fixture, NO
  trailers of any kind.
- The Polydera colormaps in `src/pyvista_trueform/_colormaps.py` are a copy
  of /Users/ziga/polydera/lunar/src/viewport/colorMaps.ts — that file is the
  definition's home; never let the two drift silently. The package is their
  one producer; `examples/_theme.py` imports them.
## Validation

```bash
python -m pytest tests
```
