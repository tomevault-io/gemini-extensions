# tmq (TOML Query) - Cursor Development Rules

## Project Overview
tmq is a complete, standalone command-line tool for TOML files. Like jq for JSON, yq for YAML — but for TOML. Written in Go with focus on completeness, independence, and script-friendliness.

## Core Principles
- **Independent**: Single binary, no dependencies on jq, yq, or other tools
- **Complete**: Query, set, delete, convert - everything needed for TOML manipulation
- **Script-friendly**: Pipe support, clear exit codes, CI/CD ready
- **Own Identity**: Not jq-compatible; our own syntax and design

## Development Standards

### 1. Code Quality & Clean Code
- Follow Go best practices and official Go style guide
- Use `gofmt` and `goimports` for consistent formatting
- Meaningful variable/function names, clear comments
- Single responsibility principle for functions
- DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle
- Error handling: return errors, don't panic except in CLI main
- Use context for cancellable operations

### 2. Go Standards Compliance
- Go 1.21+ minimum version
- Use Go modules (`go.mod`)
- Follow standard Go project layout
- Use official Go libraries where possible
- Proper package naming (lowercase, no underscores)
- Use interfaces for testability and dependency injection
- Align with [Effective Go](https://go.dev/doc/effective_go) and [Code Review Comments](https://go.dev/wiki/CodeReviewComments) (receiver names, error handling, imports, line length, etc.)
- Run `go vet` and `gofmt` (or `goimports`); fix all reported issues

### 3. TOML Standards Compliance
- Full TOML 1.0.0 specification compliance
- Support for all TOML data types and structures
- Preserve formatting and comments when possible
- Handle edge cases (arrays, nested tables, inline tables)
- Proper encoding/decoding of special characters

### 4. Testing Requirements
- **Beyond Code Coverage**: Focus on quality metrics, not just coverage percentage
- **F.I.R.S.T Principles**: Fast, Isolated, Repeatable, Self-Checking, Timely
- **Fault Detection**: Tests must actually catch bugs and validate behavior
- **Maintainability**: Tests should be easy to understand, modify, and extend
- **Reliability**: Tests produce consistent results across runs
- **Usability**: Tests serve as executable documentation

#### Unit Test Quality Standards
- **100% test coverage** required, but coverage is necessary not sufficient
- Unit tests for every exported function and method
- **Table-driven tests** for multiple scenarios (Go standard pattern)
- **Subtests** using `t.Run()` for hierarchical organization
- Test **edge cases**, **error conditions**, **boundary values**, and **invalid inputs**
- **Explicit error messages**: Use `t.Errorf()` with clear "got/want" format
- **Helper functions**: Mark with `t.Helper()` for clean stack traces
- **Avoid assertion libraries**: Use Go's built-in testing for better error control
- **Test isolation**: No dependencies between tests, no shared state
- **Fast execution**: Individual tests < 100ms, full suite < 10 seconds
- Mock external dependencies using interfaces and test doubles
- **Behavior testing**: Test what code does, not how it does it
- **Realistic test data**: Use meaningful constants, not random data

#### Go-Specific Testing Patterns
- **Test file naming**: `*_test.go` (see §5 for meaningful names)
- **Test function naming**: `TestXxx` with descriptive names
- **Use Go's built-in testing framework** - no external assertion libraries needed
- **Benchmark tests** for performance validation (`func BenchmarkXxx`)
- **Fuzz tests** for edge case discovery (`func FuzzXxx`)
- **Race detection**: Run tests with `-race` flag
- **Test helpers**: Create reusable helper functions for common assertions

#### Test Quality Metrics
- **Code Coverage**: 80-95% (not 100% absolute - some unreachable code exists)
- **Test-to-Code Ratio**: 1:1 to 2:1 (balance between production and test code)
- **Cyclomatic Complexity**: < 10 per test function
- **Execution Time**: Full test suite < 10 seconds for fast feedback
- **Flakiness Rate**: < 1% (tests should be deterministic)
- **Mutation Testing Score**: Tests should catch artificial defects (future goal)

### 5. Test File Naming & Size (Go Best Practices)
- **Meaningful test file names**: Names must describe what is tested.
  - Prefer `foo_test.go` for tests of `foo.go` when tests are small.
  - When splitting: use focused names, e.g. `query_new_test.go` (tests for New), `query_execute_test.go` (tests for Execute), `parser_file_test.go` (file parsing).
  - Avoid generic names like `misc_test.go` or `extra_test.go`.
- **Test file size**: Keep under 500 lines per file
- **Split large test files**: If >500 lines, split into multiple focused files by behavior/API
- **Test function length**: Individual test functions < 50 lines
- **Table-driven tests**: Can be longer if well-structured (< 100 lines)
- **Naming for split files**: `*_test.go`, `*_internal_test.go`, `*_integration_test.go` only when the suffix meaning is clear
- **Reason**: Tests act as documentation; names should make it obvious what each file validates

#### Test Organization & Structure
- **Arrange-Act-Assert**: Clear structure in each test
- **Descriptive test names**: `TestUserValidation_EmptyName_ReturnsError`
- **Given-When-Then**: Comments explaining test setup, action, and expectations
- **Test data**: Use constants or factories, avoid magic numbers
- **Error messages**: "Got X, want Y" format for clear failure diagnosis
- **Avoid test pollution**: Each test leaves no side effects for others

```

### 7. Go Doc Comments (godoc / go doc)
Follow [Go Doc Comments](https://go.dev/doc/comment). All doc comments are used by `go doc`, godoc, and pkg.go.dev.

- **Package comment (required)**: Every package has a comment introducing it, with no blank line before `package`. First sentence must start with "Package <name>" and be a complete sentence (e.g. `// Package query provides TOML query functionality for tmq.`).
- **Exported names**: Every exported (capitalized) type, func, var, const has a doc comment immediately above it. First sentence starts with the name of the symbol (e.g. `// New creates a new query from a dot-separated path.`).
- **Commands (cmd/)**: Package comment describes program behavior; first sentence conventionally starts with the program name (e.g. `// Tmq is a TOML query CLI.`).
- **Complete sentences**: Use full sentences. For booleans use "reports whether" (not "returns true or false").
- **One package comment per package**: In multi-file packages, put the package comment in exactly one file (or in doc.go).
- **doc.go (required for all packages)**: **All packages must have a doc.go file** containing the package comment, examples, and extended documentation. Even packages with short comments should use doc.go for consistency and future extensibility. Contains only the package comment and `package <name>`. No implementation code.
- **No internal implementation in doc**: Doc comments describe contract and usage, not algorithms or internals. Use inline comments for implementation details.
- **Lists, code blocks, links**: Use indented code blocks for examples; doc links as `[Name]` or `[pkg.Name]` for symbols.

### 8. Documentation Requirements
- Update documentation for every change
- Keep protectedocs/ files up to date with code changes
- Document all public APIs (see §7 for Go doc comments)
- Update ROADMAP.md progress
- Add examples for new features
- Update README.md as features are implemented
- When adding or changing a package, add or update its package doc and exported symbol docs

### 9. CLI Design
- Use cobra for CLI framework
- Consistent flag naming (--input, --output, -i for in-place)
- Clear help messages and examples
- Proper exit codes (0=success, 1=error, 2=usage error)
- Support stdin/stdout piping
- Graceful error messages

### 10. Error Handling
- Return errors instead of panicking
- Use custom error types for different error categories
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Exit codes should reflect error severity

### 11. Performance & Memory
- Efficient TOML parsing (avoid full AST for simple queries)
- Streaming support for large files
- Memory-efficient operations
- Reasonable performance benchmarks

### 12. Security
- No arbitrary code execution
- Safe file operations
- Input validation for all user inputs
- No network operations unless explicitly needed

## Development Workflow

### For Each Feature/Change:
1. **Plan**: Update ROADMAP.md and relevant docs in protectedocs/
2. **Implement**: Write clean, tested code; ensure doc.go exists for all packages (§7); add/update Go doc comments for all exported symbols
3. **Test**: 100% coverage + quality metrics (fault detection, maintainability, F.I.R.S.T); use meaningful test file names (§5); table-driven tests, subtests, clear error messages
4. **Verify**: Run `go test -race`, ensure < 10s execution, deterministic results
5. **Build**: **MANDATORY** - Always `go build` before testing with binary to ensure changes are applied
6. **Document**: Update all relevant documentation (README, ROADMAP, GOALS, NEEDS, CONCEPT, FUTURE)

## Quality Gates
- All code must pass `go vet`
- All tests must pass (`go test ./...`)
- **100% test coverage** required, but quality > quantity
- **Test quality checks**: Fault detection, maintainability, reliability, F.I.R.S.T compliance
- `gofmt` (or `goimports`) compliance
- Documentation must be current; package and exported-symbol doc comments present (§7)
- **All packages must have doc.go files** (§7)
- No TODO comments in production code
- Test files use meaningful names (§5)
- **Test execution time**: Full suite < 10 seconds
- **Test isolation**: No test dependencies or shared state
- **Race-free**: `go test -race` passes
- **Deterministic**: Tests produce same results across runs

## Common Testing Mistakes (Avoid These)
- **Coverage obsession**: 100% coverage ≠ quality tests
- **Pseudo-tested methods**: Code executed but behavior not validated
- **Slow tests**: Tests taking >100ms each or >10s total
- **Brittle tests**: Break with slightest code changes
- **No error messages**: Using `t.Fail()` without explanation
- **Test interdependencies**: Tests affecting each other
- **Testing implementation**: Testing how, not what the code does
- **Magic numbers**: Hardcoded values without explanation
- **Ignoring race conditions**: Not running `go test -race`
- **No edge cases**: Only testing happy paths
- **External dependencies**: Tests calling real APIs/databases
