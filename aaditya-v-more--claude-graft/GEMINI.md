## Invariants

**Never touch an app Graft did not create.** Bundles are identified by the
`graft.json` they carry, never by name. `Claude` and `Claude Graft` are reserved
names. This rule exists because an earlier version matched on name and deleted
`/Applications/Claude.app`.

**Never destroy what a profile owns.** Anything a link replaces is moved to a
hidden `.<name>.graft-own` sibling first, and restored when the shortcut goes
back to its own chats. A profile must never be grafted from itself — guarded in
`graft`, `relink` and `install`, because self-grafting stashes away every file
the profile has and leaves links pointing at their own names.

**A stash already sitting there is not proof of a duplicate.** Claude writes
`config.json`, and recreates chat directories, by renaming a temporary over
them, and a rename leaves a real file where the symlink was. The profile then
goes back to writing its own copy while the stash still holds the pre-graft
state. `stash` used to read that as drift and delete it, which threw away every
chat written since the graft; it now folds the two together and keeps the copy
the profile is actually using. `unstash` used to bail whenever something already
sat at the link, which is what left the stash there to arm the next graft.

**An unreadable `config.json` is not an empty one.** A profile that has never
been signed in has no file at all and can share the whole store safely. A file
that will not parse is one caught mid-rename, and treating that as "no account,
so the same account as the source" linked an entire store away. `readableConfigJSON`
tells the two apart; nothing may write that file, or decide where a profile's
chats go, without asking it.

**Credentials are borrowed, never taken.** Only the access token is decrypted,
never the refresh token: Anthropic rotates those and using one signs Claude
Desktop out. Nothing is written back to Claude's config, cookies or keychain.
The token goes to `api.anthropic.com` and nowhere else.

**The keychain is asked once, and only when asking is the way through.** Every
read tries silently first, so a build already on the item's ACL never sees a
dialog no matter who asked. When that read comes back shut the app asks rather
than falling back without saying why — once for the life of the process, never
again after a decline, and not while it is coming up hidden into the menu bar,
since a dialog thrown over a login is answered by nobody. The rule is
`ClaudeCredentials.mayRaiseDialog`, kept pure so the suite can drive it;
`UsageMonitor.mayPromptUnasked` carries the login case.

`SecKeychainSetUserInteractionAllowed` is what actually makes a read silent. The
`LAContext` the compiler suggests in its place governs items backed by an access
control, not an ACL of trusted applications, and was measured sailing straight
past the suppression and putting a dialog on screen from a background poll —
which is what the old "background polls never prompt" rule believed it had.

**Only a person starts a session.** `SessionStarter.start` runs because a
button was pressed and for no other reason: it defaults to non-interactive, so
a call from anywhere unaudited fails quietly instead of raising a keychain
prompt, and it claims the profile for the length of the call so the window and
the dropdown cannot both start the same account. The suite reads
`Sources/App/*.swift` and fails if a fourth caller appears or if `startSession`
turns up on a line with `onAppear`, `onReceive` or a timer — a view refreshes
every thirty seconds, and a session wired into one would open a five-hour
window on every account, over and over.

**⌘Q does not quit.** `applicationShouldTerminate` cancels an unasked-for
terminate and closes the window instead, because the menu bar item is the part
that does the reporting and closing a window is not asking for it to stop.
`AppDelegate.quit()`, wired only to Quit in the dropdown, is what really ends
it, along with a logout — refusing that stalls the shutdown on a dialog — and
along with an update. Sparkle starts the new version by asking this one to
terminate; refusing that left 1.0.0 running with 1.0.1 already staged, put the
window away on the way past, and wrote `mainWindowOpen` false, so every launch
after came up with no window. One refused terminate, three symptoms, none of
which named the cause. `Updater.isRelaunchingForUpdate` is the clause that
fixes it.

Window bookkeeping stops once a terminate is allowed. `AppDelegate.isTerminating`
guards it, because windows closing on the way out are the app shutting down, not
someone putting a window away, and recording it as the latter brings the next
launch — an update's own relaunch above all — up hidden. The
rule lives in `QuitPolicy` so the suite can drive it, and its last clause is
the way out: with nothing reachable in the bar, `MenuBarController.isShowing`
reads false and a quit is a quit. Ask that, not the setting; the setting says
what was wanted, not whether the bar had room.

**A status item that exists is not a status item you can click.** macOS drops
items it has no room for — a full bar, and a notch taking the middle — without
telling the app, and the dropped item is still an object that answers
`isVisible` true. `isShowing` used to be `item != nil`, which said yes to a bar
with nowhere to put it, so the clause above would have cancelled a quit and left
Force Quit as the only way out. What actually gives it away is placement:
filling the bar with throwaway items put the overflow at x of -71, -115, -160
and -204. `MenuBarPlacement.isReachable` is the rule, horizontal only because
the bar sits above `NSScreen.frame` and a full containment test rejects every
item there is. Seen for real: Graft vanished from the bar with the process alive
and polling, and came back when another app's item was removed.

**The version is written down once.** `VERSION` at the repo root, stamped into
the bundle by `build.sh`. `Resources/Info.plist` carries `0.0.0` and nothing
else, so a bundle still holding that number was never stamped; the suite fails
if the real number reappears there. `release.sh` refuses to build a version
whose tag already exists — two binaries answering to one number is a thing no
update feed can tell apart, and it is only noticed after the upload.

The same is true of a version built twice without a bump, which is a thing only
a development loop does. `Installer.refreshLauncher` replaces a shortcut's
launcher when the version stamped in its bundle differs from Graft's own, so
rebuilding at the same number leaves every shortcut running the previous binary
while claiming to be current. A change to launcher code needs the bump or it
reaches nobody, and the symptom is a fix that works in the app and not from the
Dock.

**The version reaches a second repository, and that one has no build to fail.**
`VERSION` drives the bundle and the appcast, both of them here and both checked
before the upload. The Homebrew cask is in `homebrew-claude-graft` and was
edited by hand, so it sat at 1.0.6 while the feed served 1.0.10 — four releases
where `brew install` fetched a build four versions old and then had Sparkle
replace it within the hour, which is the long way round to the current version
and reads from outside like the project stopped shipping. `release.sh` now
clones the tap into `dist/`, rewrites the cask against the checksum of the disk
image that run actually built, commits it, and names the push beside the other
two. Nothing here pushes, as before; what changed is that no number is carried
across by hand and the printed instructions are no longer half a publish.

**A release carries both architectures.** `build.sh` compiles one slice per
architecture and `lipo`s them; a plain `./build.sh` stays single-slice because a
development build only has to run here. `release.sh` sets `GRAFT_UNIVERSAL=1`
and then asks the bundle what it actually got, because an Intel Mac handed an
arm64-only app reports nothing more useful than a bounce in the Dock.

**The build directory is called `build.noindex` for the suffix.** Spotlight
skips any directory whose name ends in it, and a development build needs that:
what comes out is a complete, launchable `Claude Graft.app`, so an ordinary
`build/` puts a second Graft in Spotlight beside the installed one with nothing
to tell them apart. Opening the wrong one gives two instances polling the same
profiles, racing for the same keychain prompt, and a Sparkle that updates a
bundle nobody installed. Seen for real, which is why the directory was renamed.

**Every route that opens a profile asks first.** Two Claudes on one chat store
both write the same files, so the same conversation open in two of them can lose
messages — the one way this app can cost you something. The check lived inside
`ShortcutDetail.open`, so it covered exactly one of the three buttons that open
a profile: the dropdown's Open went straight to `openApplication`, and Claude's
own profile had no shortcut to ask on its behalf, so nothing ever looked. That
last one is the case it matters for, since every shortcut grafted from main
reads precisely the files main is about to open. `ChatConflict` is the rule and
`chatStoreNeighbours(of:)` takes an optional now, nil meaning main. The suite
reads all three views and fails if one of them stops naming `ChatConflict`.

The dropdown asks with an `NSAlert`, not a `confirmationDialog`. It is an
`NSPopover`, which gives up key window the moment anything else appears and
takes any sheet it was hosting down with it.

**Opening a profile that is already open shows the Claude that is there.**
Claude Desktop never calls `requestSingleInstanceLock`, so nothing on its side
refuses a second process on one `--user-data-dir`: `open -n` twice was measured
giving two live Claudes on one profile, both reading and writing the same chat
store. That is the loss `ChatConflict` exists to warn about, reached by pressing
Open twice on the same shortcut — and it is worse than the case that rule covers,
since it is not two accounts sharing chats but one profile's own files written
over twice. `Graft.open` and `Graft.run` ask `isRunning` before anything else
and hand the pid to `reveal`. The suite fails if anything in `Sources/App` calls
`Graft.launch` directly.

**A shortcut behaves like the Graft that built it.** The bundle carries its own
copy of the launcher, nothing re-saves a shortcut on its own, and the routes
this rule matters most for never touch the app at all — the Dock, Finder and
Spotlight run the binary in the bundle and ask Graft nothing. So a change to how
opening works would have reached nobody who already had shortcuts, which is
everybody. `Installer.refreshLaunchers` replaces every stale one at launch,
recognising them by the version stamped in the bundle. Only the binary and that
stamp are rewritten: regenerating the whole plist would write the shortcut's
current name into a bundle that may still be sitting under its old one, waiting
for the save that renames it.

The conflict question goes quiet on that path, and `sharersToAskAbout` is the
clause. A profile already open is not about to be opened; the Claude being
brought forward has been reading those chats all along, so the warning would
describe a situation rather than one the press is about to create — and it
would arrive attached to a button that creates nothing.

`reveal` sends two things because neither does the other's job. Claude answers
`window-all-closed` with an empty handler, so closing the last window leaves the
process alive with nothing on screen; its `activate` handler builds the main
window back when it finds none, and the reopen Apple event — `aevt`/`rapp`,
aimed at a pid — is what fires that handler. Bringing the app forward is the
other half: a reopen on its own was measured leaving the app exactly where it
was in the stacking order, three times out of three, and
`NSRunningApplication.activate` is what moves it. The reopen needs no automation
consent and no `com.apple.security.automation.apple-events` entitlement: it was
measured going through unchanged from an ad-hoc bundle, from one signed
`--options runtime`, and from one signed with the entitlement. The scripting
activate event (`misc`/`actv`) is delivered too and does nothing, Electron
having no handler for it.

Measuring any of this needs care, and three wrong conclusions came out of not
taking it. `NSWorkspace.frontmostApplication` is kept current by notifications
on the run loop, so a poll loop that sleeps rather than pumping one reads its
own startup value for as long as it runs and reports that nothing ever changed.
That is what made a working launcher look like it needed an `NSApplication` of
its own, and then like it needed to stay alive after asking. It needs neither;
it does what it always did and exits.

**The pid comes from `ps`, never from the pgrep that answers `isRunning`.**
Every helper process Claude starts repeats the profile's `--user-data-dir`, so
the first pid pgrep offers is a renderer, and only the browser process answers
to being shown. `isClaudeProcess` is what tells them apart. pgrep also leaves
out its own ancestors, which Graft never notices — it runs as its own app — and
anything run from inside a Claude notices immediately: that Claude is the one
process pgrep will not report.

**A bundle is not an instance.** `NSWorkspace.openApplication` with the default
configuration reopens whichever instance of the bundle started first, measured
with three copies of one app running and the oldest picked every time. So Open
on Claude's own profile brought a grafted profile forward instead, since with
any shortcut running every instance of `Claude.app` is somebody else's profile.
`launch` passes `-n` for that reason, and passes no `--user-data-dir` at all for
the main profile, whose only mark is that absence.

**An update installs itself and says nothing.** Checked hourly and at launch
once that much has passed, downloaded, installed and restarted with nobody
asked. The gentle-reminder route was tried first and was wrong for this app:
there is usually no window to put a question in front of, so an update that
waits to be noticed is one that never gets installed. What it costs is the
status item blinking out and back.

That goes for a press as much as for the schedule. `checkForUpdatesInBackground`
is what the dropdown calls, never `checkForUpdates` — Sparkle's interactive
check puts up its own panel and waits on Install and Relaunch, so the scheduled
check installed silently while the button asked, which is one app behaving two
ways. Pressing a line that already reads "Version 1.0.6 is available" is not a
request to be asked whether you want it. The suite fails if the interactive call
reappears.

That only works because `applicationShouldTerminate` lets it through, and
Sparkle's own header warns that `updaterWillRelaunchApplication` may not be
called. So `isRelaunchingForUpdate` is set at every hook before an install —
`willInstallUpdate`, `willInstallUpdateOnQuit` and the relaunch — and the suite
counts them, because one missed hook is an update that installs and never
starts, which happened twice before it was understood. `willInstallUpdateOnQuit`
also calls the immediate handler: Sparkle would otherwise wait for a quit that a
menu bar app may not see for weeks.

**The feed keeps every release it has ever carried.** `generate_appcast` prunes
to a handful of entries per branch point unless told otherwise, so each release
silently dropped the oldest — 1.0.0 and 1.0.1 had already gone before anyone
looked. Nothing breaks when they go, since a client is offered the newest entry
regardless, but the signature in an entry is over an archive that is never built
again, so a dropped entry cannot be regenerated, only recovered out of git.
`release.sh` passes `--maximum-versions 0` and checks the count went up by
exactly one; the old check was "no fewer than before", which adding one and
losing one satisfies perfectly.

**The feed URL is unchangeable once shipped.** A copy out in the world polls the
URL it was born with, and GitHub gives Pages no redirect if the account is ever
renamed — repositories redirect, Pages does not. `Resources/Info.plist` and the
`--download-url-prefix` in `release.sh` both name the account, and the suite
checks they agree, because a rename that touched one would leave the feed
advertising downloads nobody can fetch.

**One account, one figure.** The window read `plan-usage-history.json` for
itself while the menu bar showed what the endpoint had just answered, so one
account was reported from two sources that do not agree. That file is only
written while that Claude runs, so a profile closed for days had the window
showing figures from before a weekly reset — 92% of a week the bar correctly
had at 30%, side by side on one screen. Both detail views take
`UsageMonitor.entry(for:)` now, which is live where live is available and falls
back to the same file underneath; the suite fails if `Graft.usage(` reappears
in either of them. Their Start Session buttons `invalidate` too — that rule was
written for the dropdown alone, and the moment a window showed the monitor's
figure it needed it for the same reason.

**Profile folders are validated.** One plain component inside Application
Support, never `Claude`, never a path. Without this, typing `Claude` into the
folder field pointed a shortcut at Claude's own profile.

## SwiftUI rules this app learned the hard way

**No `MenuBarExtra`.** Alongside a `WindowGroup` it loops on macOS 26 — every
scene update rebuilds the main menu, which invalidates the scene. 100% CPU and
about a gigabyte a minute, but only while a window is open. Bisected: not the
label, not the content, not the style. The status item is an AppKit
`NSStatusItem` in `MenuBarController`.

**Nothing blocking in a view body.** No filesystem, no process spawn, no
network. `Graft.isRunning` once used `waitUntilExit()` inside a body; that spins
the run loop, re-enters AppKit layout mid-update, and segfaults with a null
program counter. Every process wait now uses a semaphore, and status is read on
a background queue into `@State`.

**Long-lived objects live in `enum Shared`, not `@StateObject` on the App.**
Observing them from the App value invalidates the whole scene on every poll.

## Facts about Claude Desktop that the code depends on

Chat history is `<store>/<accountUuid>/<orgUuid>/`, in both
`claude-code-sessions` and `local-agent-mode-sessions`. An instance reads only
the account it is signed into, so linking a whole store does nothing across two
accounts — the link is made one level deeper, mapping this profile's
`<account>/<org>` onto the source's active one.

**A grafted profile cannot keep a Claude Code session, and no link will make
it.** The command line has one login for the whole machine, so a session
started from any profile is owned by that account rather than the profile's,
stamped `ownerAccountUuid`/`ownerOrganizationUuid` on the `bridge-session` line
of `~/.claude/projects/<encoded cwd>/<cliSessionId>.jsonl`. Claude Desktop
writes a session record only for the account it is itself signed into, so a
grafted profile shows the conversation in its window and writes nothing at all:
on close it is gone from both profiles, leaving a transcript naming an owner
neither one filed. It reads exactly like the other profile deleting it, which
is how it was first reported.

Measured five ways before it was believed. Linking the owner's account path
into the grafted profile so the record had somewhere to land changed nothing;
neither did closing the other Claude for the whole test, nor leaving the app
open two minutes rather than thirty seconds. The record is never written. The
absent directory was the rule showing through, not the cause, and the link that
looked like the fix was reverted rather than shipped.

What is Graft's to repair is the record, and the repair is to write it.
`Graft.fileMissingSessionRecords` sweeps the transcripts for bridge lines,
asks which profile the owner's account lives on now, and writes
`local_<cliSessionId>.json` into that profile's `<ownerAccount>/<ownerOrg>` —
where the session's own window and every profile grafted onto it lists it,
a linked organization included. Every field comes out of the transcript, so
nothing is invented: the id from the filename, the owner and organization
from the bridge line, the title from the title line, the times from the first
and last stamps. The bridge id is renamed on the way — `cse_…` in a
transcript is `session_…` in a record, measured against a session that had
both written down — and the name is fixed by the session, so a later pass
can only ever find a record where an earlier one left it, and a delete in a
sidebar writes a marker naming it the same way.

Four things hold the sweep in. A transcript written moments ago waits out a
quiet window first, a minute of it — but only while a Claude signed into the
owner's account is actually running, because that is the only thing the wait
is for. Such a window writes the record itself within moments of a session
opening, measured at about a second, so a minute is far more than that wait
needs; with no such Claude up there is nobody to wait for, and waiting anyway
made closing a chat and reaching straight for the other profile the one move
guaranteed to miss it. A sidebar is built once, at launch, and that launch is
the very press being waited out. A record already on disk is never written
over by a pass either way. What a pass files it keeps current: the
sweep remembers the facts behind every record it wrote, in
`ClaudeGraft/session-records.json`, and while the record on disk still holds
exactly those bytes it is known to be one of ours to refresh as the
transcript moves — a title landing late, a turn finishing. The moment the
bytes stop matching, Claude has rewritten the record in its own shape, and
the sweep retires its version for good, because a parsed transcript flattened
over the host's record would lose everything the transcript cannot recover,
its MCP server config for one. A session still being written grows past the
quiet window and files later. And a transcript with no prompt in it is never
filed at all — an open-and-close with nothing said never had a conversation
to lose.

**A record you cannot see is not a record somebody deleted.** A session taken
out of a sidebar stays out, and there are two ways of knowing which one went.
Graft names its records for their session, so the marker Claude leaves behind
carries the session's own id — a deletion read rather than inferred, needing
no memory of earlier passes at all. For a record Claude named itself, by an id
no transcript carries, the sweep goes on its own memory of which store each
record sat in: one gone from a store the pass actually read is one somebody
deleted — and two things have to hold before a pass will say so.

The store has to have been read. Every directory in the walk is taken with a
`try?`, so a profile that has been deleted, or stashed behind a graft, or is
waiting on a permission, comes back holding nothing, and reading that as a
sidebar cleared by hand withdrew every session it held, for good, which is a
thing no later pass undoes. Graft stashes organization folders itself, so its
own graft was the surest way to trigger it. `StoreContents.stores` is the set
of directories a walk really got into; a record in a store missing from it
stays remembered exactly where it was.

And the record has to be missing twice over. Claude re-files a session under a
new record name as it runs — a record named for one session was found on this
machine holding a session filed under another name an hour earlier — so there
is a moment when the old name has gone and the new one has not landed, and a
pass falling into it reads a deletion that never happened. `vanished` carries
the sessions one pass found missing so the next can agree, and nothing missing
is filed while that question is open: filing it would put the record back
under this app's own name, the pass after would find it there, and a chat
taken out of a sidebar would be quietly restored by the very thing meant to
notice it going.

The one guess left is a marker written before the first pass ever ran, which
names a record no longer there and can only be read by timing — the session
that had just gone quiet in the minute before the press.

Claude launched the ordinary way carries **no `--user-data-dir` at all**, so the
main profile is recognised by the absence of one. Profile paths are prefixes of
each other, so every `pgrep` on `user-data-dir=` must be anchored with
`([[:space:]]|$)` or one instance makes every shorter-named profile look like it
is running.

`config.json` holds `oauth:tokenCacheV2` in Chromium safe storage: keychain item
service `Claude Safe Storage`, account `Claude Key`, PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA1 with salt
`saltysalt` over 1003 iterations, AES-128-CBC, IV of sixteen spaces, `v10`
prefix.

That item's decrypt ACL names each trusted build by code hash, so an ad-hoc
signature earns a fresh entry every time the app is rebuilt — nine entries for
the same `build.noindex/Claude Graft.app` path were counted on the development machine,
alongside ten `cdhash:` entries in the item's partition list. A Developer ID
would be one `teamid:` entry that survives every version. Both a suppressed read
and a declined dialog answer `errSecAuthFailed`, so the two are told apart by
which call was made, never by the status.

Sparkle ships its framework already ad-hoc signed, and its validator accepts an
EdDSA signature alone — the header comment on `validateUpdateForHost` says it
"allows change of Code Signing identity", which is exactly what an ad-hoc build
does on every compile. Elsewhere it says outright that "if no Apple Code Signing
certificate is available, adhoc signing can be used at minimum". `SUFileManager`
strips `com.apple.quarantine` from what it installs, so only the first install
meets Gatekeeper. The XPC services are removed from the embedded copy: they need
entitlements this app does not carry, and launchd refuses them for a
non-sandboxed app. The signing key lives in the login keychain under
`https://sparkle-project.org`; `vendor/bin/generate_keys -x` exports it if CI
ever needs it.

Live usage is `GET https://api.anthropic.com/api/oauth/usage` with a bearer
token and `anthropic-beta: oauth-2025-04-20`. It answers with `five_hour` and
`seven_day` objects carrying `utilization` and `resets_at`, plus
`subscription_type`, a `limits` array of `weekly_scoped` per-model windows, and
`extra_usage` credits. The last two are parsed but not shown anywhere yet.

`plan-usage-history.json` is the fallback: samples of `{t, org, u:{fh, sd}}`
where `fh` is the five-hour percentage used and `sd` the seven-day one, written
only while that instance runs. It is ~180KB and grows, so it is parsed once per
change and cached against modification time and size.

Claude Code's command line keeps **one** login for the whole machine in the
keychain, so `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` does not isolate accounts. That is why Start
Session goes through each profile's own borrowed token rather than the CLI.

## Polling budget

The thirty-second timer reads local files and checks what is running. The API
has three rungs, and `mayUseCache` is the rule: five minutes for a tick nobody
asked for, a minute for somebody looking — that is opening the dropdown — and
two seconds for somebody who pressed something. The last rung was missing, and
its absence is why Refresh Usage felt broken: opening the dropdown starts a pass
of its own, so the figure was always a few seconds old, always inside the
minute, and the button handed it straight back without asking anyone anything.
Two seconds is only wide enough to swallow a double-click.

A press that lands while a pass is running is queued, not dropped. `arrival` is
the rule. `inFlight` used to refuse everything, and the pass it most often
refused was the one the dropdown had just started itself — so the obvious move,
open the dropdown and press Refresh because the number looks stale, was the one
guaranteed to do nothing.

Starting a session is the one thing here that changes the number itself, so it
calls `invalidate` for that profile before refreshing rather than trusting any
cache window. That is ordered against the refresh by the serial queue both go
through. Without it, a five-hour window would open and the bar would go on
showing the figure from before it.

Opening the dropdown asks for a current figure but does not skip the backoff,
because a failing endpoint would then be asked again on every open. Failures
back off 60/120/300/900/1800 seconds and a success clears the count; a
`Retry-After` from the service wins and is the one wait a person pressing
refresh cannot skip.

The session-record sweep is on no timer at all. A record is read when a Claude
starts and at no other moment — it builds its sidebar as it comes up — so the
pass that matters is the one a shortcut runs on its way to opening one, in
`Graft.run`, after the links and before the launch. It runs on the way past a
profile that is already open too, which is the one case nothing else covers:
with no timer, that press is not going to start anything, and without a pass
on it, going looking for a chat that had not arrived yet was the surest way to
leave it not arriving. Graft itself runs one when it starts and one when the
dropdown opens, which is where the line about what was recovered is shown. The thirty-second timer this replaced filed records
that nobody would read for hours, and the one thing it was really buying —
being current when a profile opened — is bought better by the profile's own
launch.

That only works because a pass is cheap enough to stand in front of a window
opening. Two hundred megabytes of transcript is read in about a fifth of a
second: each line's bytes are walked once and every `"key":"value"` pair taken
off it as it goes, rather than the line being searched again for each of a
dozen fields, which took twelve seconds and made the sweep something that
could only ever happen in the background. Strings are walked the way JSON
writes them, escapes and all, since a value that ends early takes the rest of
the line with it. What has been parsed is remembered against each file's size
and modification time in `ClaudeGraft/transcript-cache.json`, so the pass a
launcher actually pays is forty milliseconds — in memory alone that cache
would be worth nothing to a launcher, which is a process that exits the moment
it has handed over.

One field is not read the way the rest are. An answer is written
`{"parentUuid":…,"message":{…,"type":"message",…},"type":"assistant"}`, so the
first `type` on the line belongs to the message nested inside it and the line's
own comes last — taking the first, which is right for every other field, quietly
put every recovered session back at the default model and effort.

## Verification state

Working and checked end to end: shortcut creation, adopting an existing profile,
cross-account chat mapping, live usage for both accounts, memory steady around
106MB at zero idle CPU. Quitting too, from outside: with the item in the bar a
quit is cancelled, the window closes and `mainWindowOpen` goes to 0 with the
process still alive; with `showInMenuBar` off the same quit ends it, so the app
cannot become unquittable. Quit in the dropdown takes the second of those two
paths.

The session-record sweep has run for real on this machine: forty-six sessions
that had closed without records — every test conversation plus months of
history back to the migration — were filed into Claude-3's store in one pass,
and Claude 3 launched on that store with the hand-written prototype record
among them and left it exactly where it was put. The recovered sessions were
then opened from Claude 3's sidebar by a person, and Claude 3 accepted them
well enough to rewrite their records in its own shape seconds later — which
is the takeover that retires a filed record, seen from both sides in one
night. A live test closed the loop end to end: a session started from
Claude 2 after the install filed itself on schedule, five minutes of quiet
after it closed, and was in Claude 3's store the next time it opened. The
first look missed it, inside that quiet window, which is what shrank the
window to a minute and taught the sweep to keep its records current instead
of freezing them at first write.

The rewrite that moved filing into the launcher was checked against this
machine's own history rather than against fixtures. The parser that walks
bytes was run beside the one that searched strings over all 184 transcripts
in `~/.claude/projects`, 199MB of them, and the facts came out identical for
every single one — 79 sessions parsed, 105 correctly declined for having no
bridge line — at 0.19 seconds against 11.85. A pass with nothing cached
anywhere costs 536ms; a fresh process with the cache already on disk, which
is what a launcher is, costs 42ms.

Unproven: **Start Session** has never successfully opened a window. It POSTs one
Haiku message with `max_tokens: 4` and Claude Code's system prompt, which these
tokens are minted for. If that turns out to be wrong the API's own error message
surfaces in the UI rather than being swallowed — read it rather than guessing.

`~/Library/Application Support/ClaudeGraft/usage-status.json` records what each
poll found, including whether the figures came from the API. Read it to check
the state of live usage instead of reading numbers off the screen.
