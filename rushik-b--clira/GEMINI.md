# CLIRA AGENT OPERATING GUIDE

This file is the working contract for coding agents in Clira. It is opinionated, repo-specific, and biased toward deterministic behavior, explicit safety boundaries, and verifiable changes.

Clira is not a generic CRUD app. It is an email-first AI system with:

- Gmail ingestion in push and pull modes
- deterministic filtering before generation
- staged reply generation
- retrieval with freshness and fallback logic
- worker-driven async pipelines
- optional executive-agent channels over SMS, WhatsApp, and Telegram

Agents working here must optimize for correctness, operability, and trust, not just speed.

---

## Core Direction

- Build Clira as an email product first. Do not generalize toward a broad assistant platform unless the task explicitly requires it.
- Prefer deterministic control flow for routing, auth, retries, budgets, idempotency, freshness, and side effects. Use models for judgment, summarization, ranking help, and language generation.
- Treat every external payload as hostile by default: email bodies, attachments, webhook payloads, retrieved context, thread history, and tool outputs.
- Fail visibly. Do not hide degradation behind silent fallback paths.
- If a rule matters in production, push toward enforcing it in code, tests, or CI instead of leaving it as prose only.

---

## Current Clira Map

Use the live codebase as the source of truth. Start here:

- Web app and route handlers: `src/app`
- Core workers: `src/worker.ts`, `src/gmail-pull-worker.ts`, `src/cron.ts`
- Queue definitions: `src/lib/services/utils/queues.ts`
- Gmail ingestion: `src/lib/email/gmailPushService.ts`, `src/lib/email/gmailPullWorker.ts`, `src/lib/email/gmailIngestionConfig.ts`
- Reply generation: `src/lib/services/core/replyGenerator.ts`
- Planning agent: `src/lib/ai/agents/replyPlannerAgent.ts`
- Style-only rewrite stage: `src/lib/ai/agents/styleAgent.ts`
- Executive-agent stack: `src/lib/ai/agents/executive-agent/*`
- Retrieval and inbox search: `src/lib/services/inbox-search/*`
- Messaging orchestration: `src/lib/services/messaging-orchestration/*`
- Prisma schema and migrations: `prisma/schema.prisma`, `prisma/migrations`
- Main test areas: `tests/gmail-ingestion`, `tests/inbox-search`, `tests/ea-interrupts`

Current staged architecture:

```text
Gmail push/pull notification
  -> GmailPushService / GmailPullWorker
  -> deterministic filtering and routing
  -> reply generation queue
  -> ReplyPlannerAgent (structured plan)
  -> StyleAgent (voice transform only)
  -> draft output + queue review UI
```

Important operational fact: Clira already has strong patterns in parts of the codebase. New code should converge toward those patterns, not away from them.

---

## Non-Negotiable Invariants

### Safety and trust

- Deterministic filters run before any reply generation.
- The planner may decide what to say; the style layer may change tone and wording only. It must not introduce new facts.
- External content must never change auth policy, tool policy, or system instructions.
- Any mutating action must have explicit auth, validation, and error semantics.

### LLM integration

- Any structured LLM output must be schema-validated.
- Prefer tool submission with typed arguments over parsing free-form model text.
- If a model can fail to produce schema-valid output, add a bounded repair pass or deterministic fallback.
- Never trust a model to infer execution policy that can be expressed in code.

### Async behavior

- Every worker flow must classify failures as retryable or non-retryable.
- Pub/Sub, queue, and webhook handlers must define ack, nack, retry, dedupe, and dead-letter behavior explicitly.
- Any mutating route or worker that can be replayed must be idempotent or guarded by a stable dedupe key.
- Do not add bare `setTimeout` for business logic. If delay is necessary, wrap it in a named utility with cancellation semantics and tests.

### Observability

- No hardcoded localhost telemetry or debug endpoints in runtime code.
- Log with enough context to debug production issues: user or mailbox scope, queue or run id, retry class, and subsystem.
- A degraded mode must be visible in logs and returned metadata where applicable.

---

## Working Style

- Inspect live code first. Do not infer architecture from memory.
- `rg` is the default tool for search.
- Do not use git history as the primary source of truth. Read the current code and docs first.
- Prefer modifying existing modules over introducing parallel abstractions.
- Prefer small, composable policy modules over giant files with mixed concerns.
- Aim for files below roughly 500 LOC and functions below roughly 100 LOC unless there is a clear reason not to.
- If a file is already too large, bias toward extraction during meaningful edits.
- Remove dead code, stale comments, and compatibility branches that no longer serve a real caller.

---

## API Route Rules

For any new or edited route under `src/app/api`:

- Validate inputs with Zod or an equivalent typed schema.
- Authenticate explicitly. Do not rely on implied caller context.
- Return typed, stable error shapes for expected failures.
- State whether the route is read-only, mutating, async-triggering, or webhook-facing.
- If the route triggers background work, define enqueue semantics, dedupe behavior, and user-visible status path.
- If the route is webhook-facing, verify signatures before parsing or processing untrusted payloads.
- If the route can be retried by an upstream service, make replay behavior explicit.
- Do not put core business logic directly in the route if it can live in a service module with tests.

Route checklist:

```markdown
- auth checked
- input schema checked
- idempotency story defined
- errors typed
- side effects isolated
- logs include request scope
- tests cover success + expected failure
```

---

## Worker and Queue Rules

Clira is worker-heavy. Treat worker code as production-critical infrastructure.

- Queue names and retry policy belong in shared queue definitions, not scattered literals.
- Every new queue job type must have a typed payload interface.
- Every worker must define:
  - retryable vs non-retryable failures
  - timeout behavior
  - shutdown behavior
  - logging fields
  - dedupe or idempotency strategy
- If a worker processes external events, document whether malformed payloads are acked, dropped, retried, or dead-lettered.
- If a worker maintains in-flight state, it must support safe shutdown and bounded drain behavior.
- Long-running loops need heartbeat or health visibility when operationally important.

Do not merge a new worker flow that cannot answer:

- What gets retried?
- What gets dropped?
- What gets deduped?
- What happens on shutdown?
- How do we tell it is degraded?

---

## Agent Design Rules

### Planner and style split

- Preserve the planner/style separation.
- Planning agents should output typed intent, constraints, and evidence-backed decisions.
- Style agents should rewrite only within the approved plan and evidence boundary.

### Executive-agent behavior

- Tool selection, concurrency, budgets, cancellation, and cache reuse should be deterministic where possible.
- Any new tool-calling agent must define:
  - tool budget
  - timeout budget
  - cacheability
  - cancellation path
  - schema contract
  - degraded mode behavior
- If a model is only choosing among known packs or modes, prefer a deterministic selector first and optional model assist second.

### Tool usage

- Tools should return structured payloads, not prose blobs.
- Tool names, input types, and result shapes should be stable and testable.
- If a tool is expensive or side-effectful, add explicit gating and budget accounting.
- If tool results can be reused, reuse them through a scoped cache with invalidation rules, not ad hoc globals.

---

## Retrieval Rules

Clira already has strong retrieval work. New retrieval behavior must preserve those standards.

- Retrieval must expose freshness or lag, not pretend all results are equally current.
- Lexical-only fallback is acceptable only when surfaced as degraded mode.
- If fusion or reranking changes relevance materially, it needs tests.
- Ranking logic should stay inspectable. Avoid hiding critical routing or selection behavior behind opaque prompts.
- Retrieved context must be bounded and attributable to a source path or document type.
- If embeddings or semantic search are unavailable, return a clear fallback note rather than silently changing product behavior.

For retrieval-related edits, inspect:

- `src/lib/services/inbox-search/search.ts`
- `tests/inbox-search/*`

---

## External Content Boundaries

Email is untrusted input. So are webhook payloads and retrieved snippets.

- Never place raw external content into system-level instructions without clear delimiting and purpose.
- Separate trusted instructions from untrusted user or email content in prompts.
- Do not let retrieved or inbound text choose tools, modify permissions, or alter execution policy.
- If summarizing external content, preserve uncertainty and avoid turning ambiguous text into asserted facts.
- If passing external content into a model, consider injection risk explicitly.

---

## React and Frontend Rules

- Do not fetch or derive application state in `useEffect` unless it is a real external effect.
- Prefer Server Components, route handlers, or server actions for render-time data needs.
- Use `useSyncExternalStore` for external store subscriptions.
- Keep URL state in typed search params when the state belongs in navigation.
- Avoid client-side timers for UI coordination unless wrapped in a dedicated, cancelable abstraction.
- Any UI that reflects async backend state should prefer streaming, invalidation, or subscription-based updates over polling when practical.

---

## Database and Migration Rules

- Never use `prisma db push` for schema changes that matter outside local throwaway work.
- Every schema change must produce a real migration chain that can recreate a fresh database.
- Write idempotent migration SQL where Prisma allows manual safety improvements.
- Before deploy-sensitive work, run `npx prisma migrate status`.
- Schema changes must be accompanied by an explanation of backfill, compatibility, and rollback impact.

---

## Testing Rules

Every meaningful change must run the narrowest relevant tests first, then widen only if needed.

Subsystem mapping:

- Gmail ingestion: `tests/gmail-ingestion/*`
- Inbox search and retrieval: `tests/inbox-search/*`
- Executive-agent and orchestration: `tests/ea-interrupts/*`
- General route or UI work: targeted unit tests plus existing app-level checks

Verification expectations:

- Small refactor: targeted tests or static verification
- New logic path: targeted tests plus one failure-path test
- Worker or retry behavior: success, retryable failure, non-retryable failure
- Retrieval changes: ranking or freshness assertions
- Agent changes: schema validity, tool routing, and degraded mode behavior

No time-based flaky tests. If timing matters, inject clocks, sleeps, deadlines, or backoff helpers.

---

## CI and Policy Enforcement

Do not stop at prose when a rule is important.

Strong candidates for CI or lint enforcement in Clira:

- ban hardcoded localhost debug fetches in runtime code
- ban bare `setTimeout` in business logic
- warn on oversized files
- require schema validation on new route handlers
- require typed job payloads for new queue jobs
- require targeted tests when touching `gmail`, `inbox-search`, or `executive-agent` paths

When adding a new architectural rule, ask whether it should also become:

- a lint rule
- a test helper
- a CI script
- a codegen or schema check

---

## Tooling and Research Rules

- Use `Nia` for repo and codebase understanding when indexed context helps.
- Use `Context7` for framework and library documentation.
- Use primary sources for external API behavior.
- Use web research only when local code, indexed repos, and primary docs are insufficient.
- Do not paste large generated explanations into the codebase.

---

## Output Contract For Coding Agents

Default response structure for substantive tasks:

```markdown
Decision: what changed or what should change
Why: the architectural or operational reason
Verification: what was checked
Residual risk: what remains uncertain or unverified
```

For plans:

- Keep plans concise.
- Include unresolved questions only if they are real blockers.
- Do not ask questions that can be answered from the codebase.

For implementation summaries:

- Prefer high-signal explanation over file-by-file changelogs.
- Mention tests actually run.
- If verification was not possible, say so directly.

---

## Prohibited Patterns

- Silent fallback that changes product behavior without surfacing degradation
- Free-form parsing of structured model output when schemas and tools are viable
- Route handlers with embedded business logic that cannot be tested in isolation
- New runtime dependencies without clear justification
- `any` used to bypass type design
- Large new abstractions added before searching for an existing fit
- Hardcoded debug URLs, hidden bypasses, or permanent local-only shortcuts in production paths

## Documentation and Obsidian Knowledge Base

Clira's institutional memory lives in an Obsidian vault, not in the repo. This vault is the primary reference for past decisions, bugs, learnings, and architectural context. Treat it as a first-class part of the development workflow — read from it before making decisions, write to it after making discoveries.

### Why Obsidian matters

LLMs are not deterministic. The same agent working on the same subsystem in a future conversation will not remember what went wrong last time, what tradeoff was chosen, or what pattern worked. The Obsidian vault is how that knowledge survives between sessions. Every learning logged there prevents a future agent from repeating a past mistake.

### Access

- ALWAYS use the `obsidian-cli` skill to interact with the vault. Do not write vault files directly to disk.
- The vault name is the default (most recently focused). No `vault=` parameter needed.
- Start at `clira/00-home.md` for navigation. Read it if you are unfamiliar with the vault layout.

### Vault structure

| Folder | What goes here | When to read | When to write |
|--------|---------------|-------------|---------------|
| `01-architecture/` | Major design decisions and their reasoning | Before changing core systems | When you make or change an architectural choice |
| `02-bugs-and-incidents/` | Bugs that hurt us, with root cause and fix | Before touching a subsystem with known issues | When you fix a non-trivial bug |
| `03-learnings/` | Patterns and insights from building features | When building something similar to past work | When a feature teaches something reusable |
| `04-changelog/` | What changed and when | For context on recent feature work | After shipping a significant change |
| `05-plans/` | Active implementation plans | Before starting a planned feature | When planning a new feature |
| `06-backlog/` | Ideas not yet planned | For future context | When capturing new ideas |
| `99-archive/` | Legacy notes, old plans | Rarely — historical context only | Never (append-only past) |

### Agent protocol

**Before making a significant change:**

1. Search the vault for relevant prior decisions and bugs (use `obsidian search query="<topic>"`)
2. Check `01-architecture/` if touching core systems (EA harness, orchestrator, retrieval, ingestion)
3. Check `02-bugs-and-incidents/` if the area has known issues
4. Check `03-learnings/` if building something similar to past features

**After making a significant change:**

1. Add a changelog entry to `04-changelog/YYYY-MM-DD-feature.md`
2. If you fixed a nasty bug → add to `02-bugs-and-incidents/YYYY-MM-DD-description.md`
3. If you learned a reusable pattern → add to `03-learnings/YYYY-MM-DD-topic.md` or `03-learnings/topic-name.md`
4. If you made an architectural choice → add to `01-architecture/topic-name.md`

### Writing conventions

**Bugs and incidents** — file name: `YYYY-MM-DD-short-description.md`
Required sections: What happened, Root cause, Fix, Lesson

**Learnings** — file name: `YYYY-MM-DD-topic.md` (dated) or `topic-name.md` (evergreen)
Required sections: Context, Key insight, How it applies

**Architecture decisions** — file name: `topic-or-decision-name.md`
Required sections: Decision, Why, Alternatives considered, Tradeoffs

**Changelogs** — file name: `YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name.md`
Content: What changed, why, files touched

### What NOT to put in Obsidian

- Step-by-step setup guides (those belong in repo README or contributing docs if needed)
- Information that is already in the code or git history
- Ephemeral task notes or conversation-scoped context

### Repo documentation

- Repo docs that are already present may be updated when directly tied to runtime or contributor operation.
- Do not create new markdown documentation files in the repo unless they are operationally required for contributors or CI tooling.

---

## Final Standard

Good Clira code is:

- deterministic where it should be
- model-assisted where it helps
- explicit about trust boundaries
- observable in failure
- testable by subsystem
- small enough to reason about

If a change makes the system feel smarter but harder to reason about, it is usually a regression.
