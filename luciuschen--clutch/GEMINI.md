# clutch Development Guide

Elisp best practices distilled from llm.el, magit, consult, eglot, vertico/marginalia.

## Core Principles

- **Question every abstraction**: Before adding a layer, file, or indirection, ask whether it solves a current problem. If the answer is hypothetical, do not add it.
- **Simplify relentlessly**: Three similar lines are better than a premature abstraction. A single large file is better than several tiny files with unclear boundaries.
- **Fewer files, clearer boundaries**: Split only when a file has a genuinely distinct responsibility. Never split for cosmetic reasons.
- **Delete, don't deprecate**: Remove unused code entirely. No backward-compatibility shims, re-exports, or "removed" comments.
- **Converge UX**: Prefer one clear entry point and one consistent behavior model over overlapping commands or branchy mode-specific behavior. Wrapper commands are fine, but they must share one resolution path, one action registry, and one default-action model.

## Diagnosis and Change Discipline

- **Find the root cause before changing behavior**: Do not patch UI timing, cache invalidation, or command flow until you can name the failing layer and explain why it is responsible.
- **One failed fix narrows the hypothesis**: If the first attempted fix does not hold, reduce the hypothesis space and gather evidence. Do not stack another speculative patch on top.
- **Two failed fixes stop the patching loop**: After two failed fixes on the same issue, stop changing behavior and switch to diagnosis only.
- **Fix the right layer**: If the real problem belongs in the JDBC agent, protocol code, cache model, or connection lifecycle, move the fix there instead of compensating in the UI layer.
- **Stabilize workflow changes before coding**: For any change that alters a primary entry point, default action, or action menu, write a short design note first. Keep object resolution, action definition, and action presentation separate.
- **Keep experiments narrow**: Start new directions with the smallest slice that proves the workflow is worth having. Do not expand scope before the first slice shows real user value.
- **Flag compensating code as design debt**: When touching a subsystem, look for code that compensates in the wrong layer — `condition-case nil` swallowing internal errors, re-querying data already available from a caller, timing hacks, or silent fallbacks. These are not blockers; record them in a postmortem as design debt rather than fixing inline. Do not let debt discovery delay the current change.

## Error Handling and Testing Discipline

- **Errors must surface, not hide**: Do not add fallback/default returns that silently swallow failures. Let errors propagate immediately.
- **Catch at the boundary, nowhere else**: Only the outermost API layer (process loop, top-level command handler) should catch and convert exceptions to error responses. Business logic must not `condition-case` around internal calls.
- **Tests must fail when the code is wrong**: If deleting or breaking the function under test does not turn the test red, the test is worthless. Assert specific, distinguishable output values.
- **No hard-coded expectations**: Use diverse inputs — multiple data sets, random values, boundary cases — so that a hard-coded return cannot satisfy all assertions.
- **Red before green**: When fixing a bug, first write a failing test that reproduces it. Confirm it fails. Then fix the code. A test written after the fix has never been proven to catch the bug.

## Architecture and Implementation

- **Interface / implementation separation**: `mysql.el` and `pg.el` are pure protocol libraries with no UI. `clutch.el` depends on `clutch-db.el`, not protocol layers directly.
- **Single responsibility per file**: Do not mix protocol code with rendering code.
- **Keep `clutch.el` as the entry point**: External consumers should continue to load `(require 'clutch)`. When implementation moves out, `clutch.el` becomes the assembler, not a grab bag.
- **Split by stable workflow boundaries**: Prefer modules such as result UI, object workflow, staged mutation flow, or schema/cache lifecycle. Do not split by vague internal labels like `common`, `utils`, or `helpers`.
- **Move whole responsibilities, not leftovers**: A file split must take a real slice with its state, commands, and render helpers together. If the original file still owns the behavior and the new file only adds glue, the split is not done yet.
- **Do not split for cosmetics**: A shorter `clutch.el` is not enough reason to extract a file. Split only when ownership becomes clearer and future changes will touch fewer files.
- **Stop splitting before glue takes over**: If a proposed extraction mostly adds `defvar`, `declare-function`, and cross-file hopping without reducing conceptual ownership, stop. That is a sign of over-modularization.
- **Use declarations to keep modules honest**: When a module depends on shared globals or functions defined elsewhere, add explicit `defvar` / `declare-function` forms so byte-compilation stays clean.
- **Favor incremental modularization**: Move the smallest coherent slice first, then reload, byte-compile, and rerun focused tests before attempting the next extraction.
- **No behavioral side effects on load**: Loading a file must not alter Emacs editing behavior (no modes enabled, no hooks fired). Package-level registration side effects are allowed: fringe bitmaps, `auto-mode-alist` entries, backend registrations, Embark action registrations, and `kill-emacs-hook` cleanup.
- **Reuse Emacs infrastructure**: Use `completing-read`, `special-mode`, `text-property-search-forward`, standard hooks, and other stock primitives.
- **Public naming**: `clutch-` for UI, `mysql-` / `pg-` for protocol. No double dash for public API.
- **Private naming**: `clutch--`, `mysql--`, `pg--`. Never call private symbols across subsystem boundaries. Files split from the same subsystem (e.g., `clutch-query.el`, `clutch-object.el`, `clutch-edit.el`, `clutch-schema.el` all belong to the `clutch` subsystem) may call each other's `clutch--` symbols, but must add `declare-function` / `defvar` declarations for byte-compilation.
- **Predicates**: Multi-word predicate names end in `-p`.
- **Unused args**: Prefix with `_`.
- **Prefer flat control flow**: Avoid deep `let` → `if` → `let` nesting. Use `if-let*`, `when-let*`, `pcase`, and `pcase-let`.
- **Prefer destructuring over repeated accessors**: Use `pcase-let` to destructure lists and plists instead of multiple `nth` or `plist-get` calls on the same object. For example, prefer `(pcase-let ((\`(,a ,b ,c) row)) ...)` over `(let ((a (nth 0 row)) (b (nth 1 row)) (c (nth 2 row))) ...)`.
- **Prefer `cl-loop` for non-trivial accumulation**: Use it instead of `dolist` + manual accumulators or over-clever folds.
- **Use the right error type**: `user-error` for user-caused problems; `error` for programmer bugs; `condition-case` for recoverable failures.
- **Prefer idiomatic primitives**: Use `vconcat` to build vectors from lists, not `apply #'vector`. Predicates returning non-nil need no `(not (null ...))` wrapper — the return value itself suffices.
- **State placement**: `defvar-local` for buffer state, plain `defvar` for shared state, `defcustom` for user options. Major modes must make their state buffer-local.
- **Mode definitions**: Read-only UI buffers derive from `special-mode`; editing buffers derive from the right parent (`sql-mode`, `comint-mode`, etc.). Register buffer-local hooks in the mode body with LOCAL=`t`.
- **Rendering discipline**: Use text properties for data-bearing annotations and overlays only for ephemeral visuals. Build render buffers from cached data, not by reparsing displayed text.
- **Function design**: Keep functions short, separate pure computation from display mutation, and keep interactive commands thin.

## Completion and Object Workflow

- Always use standard `completing-read`.
- Completion-at-point functions must return quickly and use `:exclusive 'no`.
- Add CAPFs buffer-locally via `add-hook` with LOCAL=`t`.
- Keep object resolution, action definition, and action presentation separate. Embark and Transient are presentation layers, not independent business logic systems.

## Mutation Workflow Convergence

- **One staged-mutation vocabulary everywhere**: Footer, transient labels, help text, and `README.org` must use the same staged-edit / staged-delete / staged-insert terminology.
- **Identity must converge fully**: If pending state becomes PK-based, every lookup and render path must also become PK-based.
- **Preview must show real execution payload**: A command named `Preview execution` must preview what would actually run.
- **Nearby workflows should share helpers**: Insert and edit flows should reuse completion, temporal helpers, and validation rules when semantics match.
- **UI symmetry must follow SQL semantics**: Do not copy insert-buffer metadata or controls into edit buffers unless update semantics truly match.
- **Validation must happen before context is destroyed**: Keep the user in the current insert/edit buffer when local validation fails.

## Version Baseline

- `clutch` targets **Emacs 28.1+** for the native MySQL/PostgreSQL backends.
- The SQLite backend requires **Emacs 29.1+** because it depends on built-in `sqlite-*` functions.
- The JDBC path depends on `clutch-jdbc-agent`, whose published baseline is **Java 17+**.
- Do not silently raise any baseline. If a change requires a higher Emacs or Java version, update:
  - `README.org`
  - relevant release/version metadata
  - a postmortem explaining why the higher baseline is justified

## SQL Rewrite Guardrails

- Do not rewrite SQL by brittle raw string insertion of `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, or `LIMIT`.
- Prefer top-level clause-aware transformations with safe fallback behavior.
- For CTE / UNION / DISTINCT / window-function queries, prioritize semantic correctness over aggressive rewriting.
- Keep AST-level rewriting on the roadmap; do not force full AST complexity into small fixes.

## Documentation and Release Records

- Any change to key bindings, defaults, export behavior, or user-visible workflow must update `README.org` in the same change.
- If code and docs diverge, treat code as source of truth and fix docs immediately.
- `clutch-jdbc-agent-version` and `clutch-jdbc-agent-sha256` are a pair. If one changes, review whether the other must change in the same commit.
- Do not assume a release asset is immutable just because the version string is unchanged. If the jar bytes change, update `clutch-jdbc-agent-sha256` immediately.
- Prefer bumping the agent version for released jar content changes. Replacing a GitHub release asset in place is an exceptional repair path, not normal workflow.
- Any release-asset change affecting JDBC startup or installation must update `README.org` and, when the tradeoff is non-obvious, add or update a postmortem.
- The `postmortem/` directory records design decisions and lessons learned. Read relevant records before significant changes.
- Write a postmortem when:
  - adding or changing a user-visible workflow
  - choosing between non-obvious architectural approaches
  - integrating an optional dependency
  - reverting or abandoning an approach
  - deliberately deferring a known limitation
- Postmortems must explain **why**, not restate the code.

## Quality and Release Checks

- Byte-compiling `clutch.el` and every extracted `clutch-*.el` module must produce zero warnings.
- All public functions must have docstrings.
- Every file must start with `;;; -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-` and end with `(provide 'pkg)` / `;;; pkg.el ends here`.
- Export features that write files must provide explicit encoding behavior and sensible defaults.
- Document Excel compatibility guidance clearly.
- Any export-path change must include regression tests for content correctness and at least one encoding-related path.

## MELPA Compatibility Checklist

These rules keep the package compatible with MELPA submission requirements
(`package-lint`, `checkdoc`, and MELPA review conventions).

### Emacs 28.1 baseline

- Do not use `string-equal-ignore-case` (Emacs 29.1). Use `(string= (downcase a) (downcase b))` instead.
- Do not use `with-memoization` (Emacs 29.1), `use-package` (built-in from 29.1), or other 29+ APIs without a version guard.
- When in doubt, check `M-x find-function` to verify when a symbol was introduced.

### File headers

- First line: `;;; file.el --- Short description -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-`
  - Description must NOT contain "for Emacs" or the package name — both are redundant.
  - Keep the description under 60 characters.
- `;; Package-Requires:` must list all direct dependencies with minimum versions.
- `;; URL:`, `;; Version:`, `;; Author:` headers are required.
- Last line: `;;; file.el ends here`

### Naming

- Public symbols use `clutch-` prefix (or `mysql-` / `pg-` for protocol).
- Internal mode names, maps, and hooks that are not part of the user-facing API should use double-dash `clutch--` to avoid `package-lint` "not prefixed" warnings.
- Every `define-derived-mode` and `define-minor-mode` that is **not** user-facing should be private (`clutch--foo-mode`), or have `;;;###autoload` if it is user-facing.
- `defcustom` `:type` must be specified.

### Autoloads

- Add `;;;###autoload` to user-facing commands (entry points users call via `M-x`) and user-facing minor modes.
- Do NOT autoload internal helpers, variables, or private modes.

### checkdoc

- Every public `defun`, `defmacro`, `defcustom`, and `defvar` must have a docstring.
- Docstring first line must be a complete sentence ending with a period.
- Argument names in docstrings should be UPPERCASED.

### Common pitfalls

- `cl-lib` functions require `(require 'cl-lib)` — do not rely on transitive loading.
- Avoid `eval-when-compile` for runtime-needed dependencies.
- Do not use `string-equal-ignore-case`, `ntake`, `take`, `pos-bol`, `pos-eol`, or other Emacs 29+ symbols without compat shims or guards.

## Pre-Commit Checklist (Mandatory)

Every commit must pass all of these steps.

### 1. Read the full diff

```bash
git diff HEAD
```

Read every changed line before committing.

### 2. Run all test files

```bash
# Main UI/logic tests
emacs -batch -L . -l ert -l clutch \
  -l test/clutch-test.el \
  --eval '(ert-run-tests-batch-and-exit)'

# JDBC backend tests
emacs -batch -L . -l ert -l clutch-db-jdbc \
  -l test/clutch-db-test.el \
  --eval '(ert-run-tests-batch-and-exit "clutch-db-test-jdbc")'
```

### 3. Byte-compile with zero warnings

```bash
emacs -batch -L . -f batch-byte-compile \
  clutch.el clutch-ui.el clutch-object.el clutch-edit.el
```

### 4. Update tests when behavior changes

When a function's behavior changes intentionally, search all test files for existing tests of that function and update them before committing:

```bash
grep -n "function-name" test/clutch-test.el test/clutch-db-test.el
```
