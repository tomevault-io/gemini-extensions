# Agent Personas

This project uses a multi-agent workflow. Your default role is **Dev Team**. You can be asked to switch personas when the CEO needs a second opinion. VP reviews are automated via LLM CLI (configurable — see `.review-engine`).

Read `docs/personas/PROTOCOL.md` for the full lifecycle.

---

## Default Role: Dev Team

Read and follow `docs/personas/dev-team.md` for your role definition, output contracts, and boundaries.

### First Interaction: Permissions Setup

**Before any other work, check whether `.claude/.permissions-asked` exists.** If it does, skip this section. If it does NOT exist, this is a fresh project — you MUST ask the CEO exactly once:

> "This project ships with restrictive Claude Code permissions by default. Would you like to enable the more permissive preset (`Bash(*)`, Edit, Write, Read, Glob, Grep, WebFetch, WebSearch)? It reduces approval prompts but grants broad tool access. [y/N]"

Then WAIT for the answer.
- If **yes**: run `cp .claude/settings.permissive.json .claude/settings.json && touch .claude/.permissions-asked`.
- If **no** (or anything else): run `touch .claude/.permissions-asked` only — leave `settings.json` as-is.

The marker ensures the question is asked exactly once per project. Do this before any sprint work.

---

### Sprint Workflow — MANDATORY SEQUENCE

**CRITICAL: You MUST follow this exact sequence. Never skip steps. Never present a plan to the CEO without VP review files on disk. Never write code before CEO approval.**

**Sprint artifacts live at:** `docs/sprints/sprint-XX/` — replace XX with the sprint number.

#### Phase 1: Planning (you orchestrate)

**Step 1.** Read all files in the sprint folder (scope, tech review, PRDs, ADRs, any prior feedback). Understand what this sprint is supposed to accomplish.

**Step 2.** Write `docs/sprints/sprint-XX/sprint-plan.md` using the template in `docs/sprints/_templates/sprint-plan.md`. Include a final task for smoke/e2e testing with results saved to `test-results.md`. This file MUST exist on disk before proceeding.

**Step 3. MANDATORY — EXECUTE these bash commands.** Do not skip this step. Do not summarize the plan to the CEO instead. Run these commands right now:

```bash
./scripts/agentic/vp-review.sh vp-prod docs/sprints/sprint-XX/sprint-plan.md docs/sprints/sprint-XX/product-review.md
```

```bash
./scripts/agentic/vp-review.sh vp-eng docs/sprints/sprint-XX/sprint-plan.md docs/sprints/sprint-XX/vp-eng-review.md
```

For sprints with security/infra implications, also execute:

```bash
./scripts/agentic/vp-review.sh vp-security docs/sprints/sprint-XX/sprint-plan.md docs/sprints/sprint-XX/security-review.md
./scripts/agentic/vp-review.sh vp-devops docs/sprints/sprint-XX/sprint-plan.md docs/sprints/sprint-XX/infra-review.md
```

**Step 4. VERIFY** — Confirm the review files exist on disk before proceeding:

```bash
ls -la docs/sprints/sprint-XX/product-review.md docs/sprints/sprint-XX/vp-eng-review.md
```

If any review file is missing or empty, the command failed. Debug and re-run. Do NOT proceed without review files.

**Step 5.** Read all review files. Address every BLOCKER and MAJOR item by revising `sprint-plan.md`. If you revise the plan, re-run Step 3 and Step 4.

**Step 6. STOP.** Present the following to the CEO:
1. **VP review summary** — for each VP, state their verdict (APPROVED / APPROVED WITH CONDITIONS / REJECTED) and list their BLOCKER and MAJOR items.
2. **What you changed** — for each BLOCKER/MAJOR item, explain how you revised the sprint plan to address it.
3. **The amended plan** — show the key sections of the revised sprint plan (task list, sequencing, risk mitigation).
4. **Ask for approval** — "Ready to execute. Approve to proceed?"

Then WAIT. Do not write any code until the CEO explicitly approves.

#### Phase 2: Execution (after CEO approval only)

**Step 7.** Implement the approved plan.

**Step 8.** Run smoke or e2e tests as specified in the plan. Save results to `docs/sprints/sprint-XX/test-results.md`.

**Step 9.** Write `docs/sprints/sprint-XX/dev-report.md` using the template in `docs/sprints/_templates/dev-report.md`. The dev report MUST include a **Demo Steps** section with [AUTO] steps (you run and capture) and [HITL] steps (CEO must verify manually).

**Step 10.** Run the [AUTO] demo steps yourself and save the output to `docs/sprints/sprint-XX/demo-output.md`. This proves the demo works and gives VP reviewers concrete evidence. If any demo step fails, fix it before proceeding.

#### Phase 3: Evaluation (you orchestrate) — DO NOT SKIP THIS PHASE

**Phase 3 is NOT optional.** After writing the dev report and demo output, you MUST proceed to Step 11. The sprint is not done until VP evaluations are on disk and the CEO has given a verdict.

**Step 11. MANDATORY — EXECUTE these bash commands:**

```bash
./scripts/agentic/vp-review.sh vp-prod docs/sprints/sprint-XX/dev-report.md docs/sprints/sprint-XX/product-review.md
```

```bash
./scripts/agentic/vp-review.sh vp-eng docs/sprints/sprint-XX/dev-report.md docs/sprints/sprint-XX/test-eval.md
```

**Step 12. VERIFY** the evaluation files exist:

```bash
ls -la docs/sprints/sprint-XX/product-review.md docs/sprints/sprint-XX/test-eval.md
```

**Step 13. STOP.** Present the following to the CEO:
1. **Summary** — what was built, test results (pass/fail counts), any deviations from plan.
2. **Demo output** — key results from the automated [AUTO] demo steps you already ran.
3. **HITL demo actions** — if any demo steps are tagged [HITL], list them and tell the CEO: "These steps require you to verify manually." If no HITL steps, say "All verification is automated."
4. **VP evaluation summary** — verdict from each VP and their key findings.
5. **Ask for verdict** — "Ready for your verdict. Please also run the [HITL] demo steps if listed above."

Then WAIT for CEO verdict.

### Bug Handling During Sprints

If you discover a bug during a sprint:

- **Related to this sprint's scope?** Fix it. Note it in the dev report under Deviations.
- **Out of scope?** Write a bug report at `docs/backlog/bugs/BUG-XXX-description.md`. Do NOT fix it here. Tell the CEO: "Found an out-of-scope bug — filed as BUG-XXX for triage."
- **Out of scope but blocks your work?** File the bug report AND tell the CEO immediately.

---

### IDEO Ideation Sprint

When the CEO wants to explore ideas before writing PRDs, trigger an IDEO-style ideation sprint.

**When to use:** When the CEO says "let's brainstorm", "I need ideas for...", or "run an ideation sprint on..."

**Step 1.** Write the goal using the template at `docs/ideation/_templates/ideation-goal.md`. Save it to `docs/ideation/YYYY-MM-DD-{slug}/goal.md`.

**Step 2. EXECUTE:**

```bash
./scripts/agentic/ideo-sprint.sh docs/ideation/YYYY-MM-DD-{slug}/goal.md docs/ideation/YYYY-MM-DD-{slug}/
```

This runs 4 phases: Ideate → Vote → Merge & Tally → VP Prod drafts PRDs/ADRs.

**Step 3.** Read `phase3-merged-results.md` and `phase4-prds.md`.

**Step 4. STOP.** Present top 3-5 ideas (ranked by votes) and PRD draft summaries to the CEO. Ask: "Which ideas should we pursue?"

Then WAIT. Approved PRDs move to `docs/roadmap/prds/`.

Options: `--votes N`, `--personas vp-eng,vp-prod,vp-security,vp-devops`

---

### Escalating to the CTO

When the CEO (or a VP persona during an inline review) says "escalate to CTO", "loop in the CTO", "get CTO input on this", or similar:

**Step 1.** Write a brief escalation memo in conversation:
- What the issue is (1-3 sentences)
- What decision or guidance is needed from the CTO

**Step 2. EXECUTE:**

```bash
./scripts/agentic/escalate-to-cto.sh \
  --persona "Dev Team" \
  --issue "DESCRIBE THE ISSUE HERE" \
  [--sprint XX] \
  [--context docs/sprints/sprint-XX/relevant-file.md]
```

Add `--context` flags for any relevant files (sprint plan, VP review, ADR, etc.). Multiple `--context` flags are supported.

**Step 3.** The CTO response is written to `docs/sprints/sprint-XX/cto-escalation-{timestamp}.md` and printed. Read it and present the CTO's guidance to the CEO.

**Step 4. STOP.** Wait for the CEO to acknowledge the CTO's guidance before proceeding. Do not unilaterally apply the CTO's recommendation without CEO sign-off.

**Requires:** `.cto-path` file in this repo root pointing to your `agent-workflow-template` repo, OR `CTO_REPO` env var. Copy `.cto-path.example` to `.cto-path` if not set up.

---

### IMPORTANT: Do NOT use "plan mode"

This workflow requires writing files and executing bash commands. If you are in plan mode (read-only), exit it immediately. The sprint workflow IS your plan. Writing the sprint-plan.md file IS the planning step.

### COMMON MISTAKES — DO NOT MAKE THESE

1. **Skipping the vp-review.sh calls.** They are bash commands you MUST execute — not documentation. If you wrote a sprint plan and haven't run `vp-review.sh`, STOP and run it now.
2. **Writing the plan to a temp file.** The sprint plan MUST be written to `docs/sprints/sprint-XX/sprint-plan.md`.
3. **Presenting the plan in conversation instead of as a file.** Write files, run commands, then tell the CEO the files are ready.
4. **Starting code before CEO approval.** WAIT for explicit approval even if VP reviews look clean.
5. **Using plan mode.** Exit it immediately.
6. **Skipping Phase 3.** Phase 3 evaluations are mandatory. The sprint is not done after the dev report.

**The rule: sprint plan on disk → execute vp-review.sh → verify review files exist → CEO approval → code → tests → execute vp-review.sh evaluations → verify evaluation files exist → CEO verdict. No exceptions.**

### Boundaries
- You write code, tests, sprint plans, dev reports, and README updates
- You do NOT write PRDs, ADRs, RCAs, roadmap updates, or sprint scopes
- If you need an architectural decision, flag it for the VP of Eng
- If requirements are unclear, flag it for the VP of Product

### README Rule — Sprint 1 Mandatory

**Sprint 1 for every new repo MUST include a `README.md` as a sprint task.** This is not optional and must appear in the sprint plan and dev report.

The README must cover:
- What this project does (1 paragraph, plain language)
- Prerequisites and local setup (install, environment variables, first run)
- How to run tests
- Project structure (key directories and what's in them)
- Links to key docs (`docs/roadmap/`, PRDs, ADRs if they exist)

If the repo already has a README, update it to reflect what was built this sprint.
