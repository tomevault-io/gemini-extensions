# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

FlashForge Python API is a comprehensive Python library for controlling FlashForge 3D printers. The library provides **dual-protocol** support:
- **HTTP API**: Modern REST-like API for Adventurer 5M/5X and Creator 5 series printers
- **TCP/G-code API**: Legacy protocol supporting all networked FlashForge printers

The architecture is fully async/await throughout and uses Pydantic for type-safe data models.

## Core Architecture

### Client Layer Hierarchy

The library has a layered client architecture:

1. **`flashforge.client.FlashForgeClient`** (Main unified client at `flashforge/client.py`)
   - The primary user-facing API that orchestrates both HTTP and TCP communication
   - Manages HTTP session (aiohttp) for modern API endpoints
   - Contains a `tcp_client` instance for legacy operations
   - Provides 5 control modules:
     - `control`: Movement, LED, filtration, camera operations
     - `job_control`: Print job management
     - `info`: Status and machine information
     - `files`: File operations (upload/download/list)
     - `temp_control`: Temperature settings
   - Automatically detects printer capabilities (is_ad5x, is_pro, is_creator5, is_creator5_pro) based on model

2. **`flashforge.tcp.ff_client.FlashForgeClient`** (TCP high-level client)
   - Extends `FlashForgeTcpClient`
   - Implements G-code/M-code command workflows
   - Used internally by the main client's TCP operations
   - Contains `GCodeController` instance for command execution

3. **`flashforge.tcp.tcp_client.FlashForgeTcpClient`** (TCP low-level client)
   - Base TCP communication layer managing socket connections
   - Handles raw command sending/receiving
   - Maintains keep-alive connections
   - Default port: 8899, timeout: 5.0s

### Key Design Patterns

**Dual Protocol Strategy**: HTTP is used for high-level operations (printer status, file listing, job control commands) while TCP/G-code is used for real-time operations (temperature monitoring via M105, print progress via M27, thumbnails via M662).

**Model Detection**: `MachineInfoParser.from_detail()` derives `is_pro` / `is_ad5x` / `is_creator5` / `is_creator5_pro` on `FFMachineInfo` from the firmware-set integer `pid` field on `/detail` (35 = Adventurer 5M, 36 = 5M Pro, 38 = AD5X, plus Creator 5 / Creator 5 Pro PIDs — see `KNOWN_HTTP_PIDS` and the `PID_*` constants in `flashforge/api/controls/info.py`). The `pid` value is also passed through to `FFMachineInfo.pid` for downstream consumers. When `pid` is absent (older firmware) the parser falls back to a name+capability heuristic, but new code should NOT rely on substring-matching `detail.name` — that field is user-mutable via the printer's LCD or cloud account and changing it broke detection in pre-1.2.3 builds (see CHANGELOG entry for 1.2.3, ref `ff-5mp-hass#13`). The Creator 5 series is **HTTP-only**: it exposes no TCP/8899 service, so `client._http_only` is true and the client routes temperature control through the HTTP `temperatureCtl_cmd` instead of TCP M105.

**Parser Pattern**: TCP responses are parsed by specialized parser classes in `tcp/parsers/` that extract structured data from text responses (e.g., `M105` returns text like `T0:25/0 T1:25/0 B:25/0` which TempInfo parses).

```

### Building & Publishing

**IMPORTANT**: Releases are managed through GitHub Actions workflow, not manual PyPI uploads.

#### Release Process (Production)

1. **Prepare the release locally:**
   ```bash
   # Update version in pyproject.toml (e.g., 1.0.2 -> 1.0.3)
   # Update CHANGELOG.md with new version section and changes

   git add pyproject.toml CHANGELOG.md
   git commit -m "chore: bump version to X.Y.Z"
   git push
   ```

2. **Trigger GitHub Actions workflow:**
   - Go to: https://github.com/GhostTypes/ff-5mp-api-py/actions
   - Click "Publish Release" workflow
   - Click "Run workflow" button
   - Enter version number (e.g., `1.0.3`)
   - Click green "Run workflow" button

3. **Workflow automatically:**
   - Validates version format (X.Y.Z)
   - Verifies version in `pyproject.toml` matches input
   - Checks tag doesn't already exist
   - Creates and pushes git tag `vX.Y.Z`
   - Builds package with Hatchling
   - Verifies build with `twine check`
   - Creates GitHub Release with auto-generated changelog
   - Publishes to PyPI using `PYPI_API_TOKEN` secret

#### PyPI Authentication

Publishing uses GitHub Secrets (not `.pypirc`):
- **Secret name**: `PYPI_API_TOKEN`
- **Location**: Repository Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
- **Format**: PyPI API token (starts with `pypi-`)
- **Fallback**: Workflow gracefully skips PyPI upload if secret not configured

#### Manual Building (Development/Testing)

```bash
# Clean previous builds
rm -rf dist/ build/ *.egg-info

# Build package
python -m build

# Check distribution
twine check dist/*

# DO NOT manually upload to PyPI - use workflow instead
```

**Version Management**:
- Current version: **1.4.0** (as of 2026-08-10)
- Two files carry the version and both must be bumped together: `pyproject.toml` (`version = `) and `flashforge/__init__.py` (`__version__ = `). The publish workflow validates only the first, so a mismatched `__version__` ships silently.
- Package name: `flashforge-python-api`
- PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/flashforge-python-api/
- Build system: Hatchling (defined in `pyproject.toml`)

#### Important Notes

- **Never manually upload to PyPI** - always use the GitHub Actions workflow
- **Always update CHANGELOG.md** before releasing - workflow doesn't auto-generate it
- **Version must match** between `pyproject.toml` and workflow input or it will fail
- **Tags are permanent** - workflow prevents duplicate tags
- **Linear history required** - workflow creates tags on current HEAD, no version bump commits

## Testing Strategy

### Test Organization
- **Unit tests**: `test_parsers.py`, `test_utility_classes.py` - Test individual components
- **Integration tests**: `test_ad5x_live_integration.py`, `test_5m_pro_live_integration.py` - Require actual printer
- **Component tests**: `test_client.py`, `test_control.py`, etc. - Test control modules

### Test Configuration
- pytest config in `pyproject.toml` under `[tool.pytest.ini_options]`
- Markers: `slow`, `integration`, `network`
- Async mode: `auto` (pytest-asyncio)
- Test fixtures in `tests/fixtures/` and `tests/conftest.py`
- Printer configuration: `tests/printer_config.py` (for live tests)

### Running Integration Tests
Live integration tests require:
1. A networked FlashForge printer
2. Printer credentials (IP, serial, check code) configured in `tests/printer_config.py`
3. Mark tests with `@pytest.mark.integration` or `@pytest.mark.network`

## Important Implementation Details

### HTTP vs TCP Decision Matrix
- **Use HTTP for**: Status queries (`get_printer_status`), file listing, job control (start/pause/cancel), printer info
- **Use TCP for**: Real-time temperature (`M105`), print progress (`M27`), endstops (`M119`), thumbnails (`M662`), direct G-code

### Authentication & Connection
- HTTP requires: IP address, serial number, check code
- HTTP endpoint construction: `http://{ip}:{port}/...` (port 8898)
- HTTP auth via `FNetCode.generate()` adds `fnetCode` and `serialNumber` to requests
- TCP only requires IP (port 8899), no auth

### Async Pattern
All API methods are async and should be awaited:
```python
async with FlashForgeClient(ip, serial, check) as client:
    await client.initialize()  # Required for HTTP session setup
    status = await client.get_printer_status()
    await client.dispose()  # Or use context manager
```

### Type Safety
- Pydantic models in `models/responses.py` validate all API responses
- Recent fix (v1.0.1): `estimated_time` changed from `int` to `float` for validation
- Mypy strict mode enabled - all functions must have type hints

### Model-Specific Features
Certain features only work on specific models:
- **LED control**: Adventurer 5M/5X only (check `client.led_control`)
- **Filtration**: Adventurer 5M Pro only (check `client.filtration_control`)
- **Per-nozzle & chamber temperature control, material-station slot configuration / color mapping**: Creator 5 / Creator 5 Pro only (HTTP `temperatureCtl_cmd`; slot colors snap to the firmware palette via CIEDE2000 in `api/controls/creator5_palette.py`)

Capability flags (`client.is_pro`, `client.is_ad5x`, `client.is_creator5`, `client.is_creator5_pro`) are populated from `FFMachineInfo` after `verify_connection()`, which itself reads `pid` off `/detail`. Trust those flags — do not re-derive them from `info.name`.

**Never surface a raw `/detail` field as a capability flag, and never give a capability an "unknown" state.** Firmware omits fields that don't apply to a model, so an absent value means "not reported", not "no" — and any type that can hold `None` invites a consumer to read the two as the same thing. `hasMatlStation` is the known case: it is AD5X-only, and a Creator 5 Pro leaves it out of `/detail` entirely (verified on firmware 1.9.4) while reporting a fully populated `matlStationInfo` with four loaded slots. `FFMachineInfo.has_matl_station` is therefore **derived** in `MachineInfoParser.from_detail` (flag `is True` OR `slot_cnt > 0` OR non-empty `slot_infos`) and typed `bool`, not `bool | None`; the raw value stays on `FFPrinterDetail`. The same trap caught `led_control_override` downstream, where a caller's unset `False` was read as "force the capability off". Apply the rule to any new capability: derive it from the data the capability actually produces, give it no unknown state, and cover it with a fixture built from a real payload — the Creator 5 fixtures originally had no material station at all, which is why this went unnoticed through v1.3.1.

**The rule for response models: `extra="allow"` on anything parsed from a printer response, `extra="forbid"` on anything this library constructs itself.** A model that forbids unknown fields turns a firmware addition into a parse failure, and every parse failure here degrades into something that looks like a working printer with less to report — or worse. `ff-5mp-hass#18` is the canonical case: `Product` forbade extras, so an unrecognized control-state flag raised `ValidationError`, `send_product_command` returned the same bare `False` it returns for bad credentials, and the user was told their check code was wrong when it was not.

Two things this rule is easy to get half-right:

1. **It applies to nested models, not just the top-level response.** A child that forbids extras fails validation for the entire response, so `FFPrinterDetail` being `extra="allow"` bought nothing while `MatlStationInfo` / `SlotInfo` / `IndepMatlInfo` underneath it still forbade them. Every model reachable from a parsed payload has to allow extras, all the way down.
2. **The inverse half is load-bearing — do not strip `extra="forbid"` indiscriminately.** Outbound request-parameter models (`AD5XLocalJobParams`, `Creator5UploadParams`, `FilamentArgs`, …) are request bodies *we* build, so no firmware update can break them, and forbidding extras turns a caller's typo'd keyword into an error instead of a field the printer silently ignores. Same for `FFMachineInfo` and `Temperature`, which are only ever constructed by `MachineInfoParser.from_detail` from keyword arguments — there, forbidding extras is a typo check on our own parser.

The one cost of `extra="allow"` on inbound models: a typo'd `alias=` stops raising and silently becomes an extra field. Keep asserting on parsed *values* in fixtures rather than just successful construction, which is what still catches it.

**`extra="allow"` was only ever half the rule — the other half is value constraints and required fields.** Extras were fixed in 1.3.2 and the very next release still shipped a total outage from the same underlying cause, because `chamberTemp` carried `ge=-50`. The generalized rule, as of 1.3.4:

> **Inbound models validate types. They do not validate ranges, and they require only what the payload is meaningless without.**

Three reasons this is not negotiable:

1. **Pydantic fails a model as a unit.** A constraint on a field no consumer reads is enough to lose every other field in the response. `get_detail_response` turned that into "no data", which `ff-5mp-hass` showed as an offline printer — so `ge=-50` on one optional temperature made a whole printer configuration unusable and reported it as a network fault.
2. **Firmware uses out-of-band values as signals, not as errors.** Absent hardware is reported with a sentinel rather than by omitting the field: a Creator 5 with no chamber heater sends `chamberTemp: -108`, and this library itself sends `-100` as `TEMP_OFF`. Values that look impossible are routine, and the correct response is to normalize them (see `sanitize_temperature` in `models/machine_info.py`), never to reject the payload.
3. **We do not own the schema.** Every constraint is a guess about firmware we have not seen, and the cost of guessing wrong is total rather than proportional. The TypeScript client (`ff-5mp-api-ts`) takes what it needs from a response and has never hit this failure class — that is the behavior to match.

Range constraints remain correct on **outbound** models (`AD5XMaterialMapping`, `Creator5UploadParams`, `FilamentArgs`, …), where the values are ours and a bad one is our bug, caught before it reaches the printer. When adding an inbound field: give it a default, give it no range, and if it needs bounds to be useful, clamp or normalize it in `MachineInfoParser`.

**Distinguish "no answer" from "an answer we could not read".** Returning `None` for both is what made `ff-5mp-hass#18` take three releases to diagnose — the printer was reachable and the credentials were correct, but every signal the library emitted said otherwise. `get_detail_response()` returns `None` only for transport failures and raises `FlashForgeResponseError` when the body failed validation; `info.get()` raises it when a validated payload cannot be converted. `get_detail_raw()` exists so consumers can read identity fields (`pid`) without validating the rest of the payload first. Preserve this split in any new endpoint: a caller that cannot tell the two apart cannot tell its user anything useful.

### Model Detection Without TCP
**TCP is never required for model detection, and the Creator 5 / Creator 5 Pro have no TCP service at all** — nothing listens on 8899, so an `M115` handshake there does not fail fast, it hangs until the connect timeout. Detection is PID-based end to end:

1. **Before pairing:** discovery (UDP) returns the printer's PID in the broadcast packet, which `discovery/discovery.py` maps to a `PrinterModel`. This is what resolves the bootstrap problem — `/detail` needs `serialNumber` + `checkCode` (via `FNetCode`), which do not exist yet at discovery time, and the UDP packet needs no credentials.
2. **After a check code is provided:** the authenticated `/detail` call carries the same firmware-set `pid`, which `MachineInfoParser.from_detail` turns into `is_pro` / `is_ad5x` / `is_creator5` / `is_creator5_pro`.
3. **From then on:** `FFMachineInfo.pid` and those flags are authoritative. Never re-parse strings, and never substring-match `detail.name` — it is user-set (broke `ff-5mp-hass` in v1.1.8, see issue #13).

`verify_connection()` decides `http_only` from the parsed model *before* touching TCP (`client.py:408`), so the Creator 5 series never opens a socket; an explicit `http_only_override` always wins. Guarded by `tests/test_http_only_guard.py` — keep any new TCP call site behind `if not self._http_only`.

TCP `M115` remains available for older printers that actually serve it, and its `Machine Type` field (firmware-controlled, e.g. `"FlashForge Adventurer 5M Pro"`) is safe to read where it exists — its `Machine Name` field is not, being user-set like `detail.name`. It is a legacy path, not part of model detection.

> Known gap: `client.initialize()` → `init_control()` (`client.py:262`) and `get_temperatures()` (`client.py:531`) call the TCP client unguarded and would hang on a Creator 5. Neither is used by `ff-5mp-hass`. Gate them before calling either from new code.

### Derived Timestamps Are Gated on an Advancing Print

`_ADVANCING_STATES` in `api/controls/info.py` contains `MachineState.PRINTING` and nothing else. `FFMachineInfo.completion_time` is `datetime | None` (nullable as of 1.4.0) and is derived only inside that set.

`datetime.now() + estimated_time` only holds still while the firmware counts `estimated_time` down. It freezes that field the moment the print stops advancing, so with one term fixed and the clock still moving the timestamp walks forward a minute per minute — after an hour of a clog pause it claimed the print would finish an hour later than it had when the pause began, and it never stopped receding. **`HEATING` is deliberately excluded**: the pre-print warmup does not advance the job either and drifts identically, just for minutes rather than hours. Do not widen this set to "fix" a `None` during a pause — the `None` is the fix.

`print_eta` and `estimated_time` are ungated and stay correct in every state; the remaining *duration* was never wrong, only its conversion to an absolute timestamp. Prefer them where a duration will do. The bad derivation originates in the C# `ff-5mp-api` (`MachineInfo.cs:210`) that every port inherited; the same gate now exists in `ff-5mp-api-ts`, `ff-5mp-hass`, FlashForgeUI-Electron, and FlashForgeWebUI.

### Status Mapping: Reuse an Existing MachineState, Don't Add One

Firmware sends statuses the documentation does not list. `"pause"` (Creator 5 Pro, firmware 1.9.4 — not the documented `"paused"`) maps to `PAUSED`, and `"downloading"` maps to `BUSY`, both added in 1.3.5. The `"pause"` case matters disproportionately because the printer pauses *itself* on a detected clog, so an unmapped value blanked the state at exactly the moment the user needed to know why the print stopped.

**Map a new status onto an existing `MachineState` member rather than adding one.** A consumer that pins the enum to a fixed list breaks when a member appears; reusing one cannot break anyone. (`ff-5mp-hass` is not such a consumer — its `device_class=ENUM` sensor derives `options` from `MachineState` itself — but other downstreams are.) A dedicated `DOWNLOADING` state is a feature discussion, not a patch-release bugfix. Keep `"paused"` mapped alongside `"pause"`: firmware reporting one is no reason to drop the other.

### Error Handling
- HTTP errors: Wrapped in aiohttp exceptions
- TCP errors: Socket timeouts, connection refused
- Parser errors: Invalid response formats from TCP commands
- Always check `client.initialize()` return value before operations

## Common Gotchas

### Client Usage
1. **Always call `await client.initialize()`** before using the main FlashForgeClient (sets up HTTP session)
2. **Model detection** depends on printer name response - early operations may not have full capability info
3. **TCP keep-alive** runs as background task - call `dispose()` or use context manager to clean up
4. **Temperature queries** via TCP (`client.tcp_client.get_temp_info()`) return parsed objects, not raw values
5. **Thumbnail extraction** (M662) can be slow and returns large payloads - use with caution
6. **File uploads** for AD5X models have different parameters than older models (see `AD5XUploadParams`)

### Release Workflow
7. **Version bump must be manual** - Workflow does NOT automatically update `pyproject.toml` or `CHANGELOG.md`
8. **Workflow validates version match** - Input version must exactly match version in `pyproject.toml` or it fails
9. **No timestamped versions** - Previous workflow created orphaned commits with timestamp versions (e.g., `v1.0.0-20251122005123`) which caused duplicate changelogs. Current workflow uses clean tags only
10. **Changelog duplication** - If you see duplicate PRs in GitHub release notes, it means there's a tag on an orphaned commit outside the main branch lineage. Delete the orphaned tag to fix
11. **Linear git history required** - Workflow creates tags on current HEAD without making commits. All version bumps must be committed to `main` before running workflow
12. **PyPI token is required** - Without `PYPI_API_TOKEN` secret, workflow completes but skips PyPI upload
