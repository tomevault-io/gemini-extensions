# Project Instructions for AI Agents

This file provides instructions and context for AI coding agents working on this
project.

<!-- BEGIN TBD INTEGRATION format=f08 surface=agents-md -->
## tbd

This repository uses **tbd** for git-native issue tracking (beads), spec-driven
planning, and on-demand engineering guidelines.
As the agent, you operate tbd on the user’s behalf: translate their requests into tbd
actions rather than telling them to run commands.

- Run `tbd prime` to load current project state and the full tbd workflow.
- Run `tbd skill` for the complete reusable tbd skill instructions.
- Run `tbd shortcut --list` and `tbd guidelines --list` for on-demand resources.
- Track all work as beads: `tbd create`, `tbd ready`, `tbd close`, and `tbd sync`.

<!-- END TBD INTEGRATION -->

## Operating Rules

Generated from [`operating-rules.md`](operating-rules.md), which carries the evidence
for each rule. Edit there, not here.

<!-- BEGIN OPERATING RULES SUMMARY -->
- **OR-1:** Build the tool; never leave a measurement in one-off code.
- **OR-2:** Run three to five sub-agents, at a model and thinking level matched to the
  task.
- **OR-3:** Never wait on a gate with nothing else in flight; run CI beside the
  research.
- **OR-4:** Take the next slice from the handoff, not from the backlog.
- **OR-5:** Declare the workflow entry point before beginning.
- **OR-6:** Plan multi-hour work in slices before starting it, as parallel lanes with
  disjoint deliverables.
- **OR-7:** Run the documentation guidelines pass at block boundaries.
- **OR-8:** A self-declared budget is not a stop condition.
- **OR-9:** A pull request leads with what the branch cost.
- **OR-10:** Treat matched agent and host handoffs as continuation, not a reset.
- **OR-11:** Close an agenda through disposition and reprioritization.
- **OR-12:** One block in four to eight is an efficiency block, and the record says
  which.
- **OR-13:** Every fast check runs in CI; only the unavoidably slow ones leave.
- **OR-14:** A development cycle is never artificially slow.
- **OR-15:** Outcome over ceremony, and process is revised on a cadence rather than on
  irritation.
- **OR-16:** Use Git for repository integrity; reserve checksums for real trust
  boundaries.
- **OR-17:** Every routine gate has a wall ceiling, and anything above it is selected on
  purpose.
<!-- END OPERATING RULES SUMMARY -->

## Build & Test

**This project runs Python 3.14. Never invoke the `python3` on `PATH`** — it is older,
and the two interpreters disagree about what parses.
Run `uv run --frozen ...` from `packing/`, or `packing/.venv/bin/python3` directly.

The trap this closes is specific and has caught four sub-agents:
[PEP 758](https://peps.python.org/pep-0758/) makes `except A, B:` valid without
parentheses, so files using it parse under the project interpreter and are reported as
syntax errors by anything older.
`sqpack/assurance.py` and `sqpack/contacts.py` both contain the construct and both are
correct. A report that they do not parse is a report that the wrong interpreter was used
— see [`D-397`](defects.md), and `OR-2` for the three occurrences before it.

### A fresh clone

Five things have to be true before any gate can run, and the gate checks none of them.
A remote-session clone on 2026-09-22 had all five false, and the edit tier came back
three steps red with every message pointing somewhere other than the cause.

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | UV_INSTALL_DIR="$HOME/.local/bin" sh
uv python install 3.14.7                  # what packing/.python-version pins
git fetch --unshallow                     # remote-session clones arrive shallow
git submodule update --init --recursive
make hooks-install                        # npm ci, then the git hooks
```

Run `python3 -m devtools.check_bootstrap` from `packing/` to see which of the five are
already true; it prints the remedy for each one that is not, repairs nothing, and runs
under whatever `python3` the machine has, because a missing project interpreter is one
of the five things it reports.

Why each, since the failure it prevents never appears where it is caused:

- **uv before the interpreter.** uv’s download index is compiled in, so an old uv cannot
  install a new CPython at all.
  0.8.17 stops at `cpython-3.14.0rc2` and answers `uv python install 3.14.7` with “No
  download found for request”; `uv sync` then reports “No interpreter found for Python
  3.14.7”, which reads as a complaint about this repository.
  `uv self update` is not the way out — it asks the GitHub releases API and is
  rate-limited from a session proxy.
- **History before provenance.** A shallow clone makes `check_provenance` refuse
  recorded engine commits and leaves `check_session_gate` unable to decide the ancestry
  of a declared gate commit.
  Neither is a fact about the record.
- **The submodule before `uv sync`.** `vendor/kpress` is a declared workspace member, so
  an unchecked-out submodule makes uv report that it “does not appear to be a Python
  project”.
- **`npm ci` before the browser floor**, which asks for pinned binaries under
  `node_modules/.bin` rather than for anything on `PATH`.

The repository is mostly prose.
The only repo-wide tooling is Markdown formatting and the browser floor.

```bash
make hooks-install   # once after cloning: installs the lefthook pre-commit hook
make format          # format all Markdown
make format-check    # report drift without writing
```

Ruff and BasedPyright run at zero findings over every tracked Python file, the
hand-written skill assets at the repository root included; `print` is allowed only in
the tools (`devtools`, `cases`, `tests`, `benchmarks`, the console scripts, the retained
video spikes under `packing/atlas/known-best/video/spikes/`, whose generators and
browser checks report by printing, and the workbench command modules under
`packages/workbench/tools/`), and the two standalone verifiers under
`packing/cases/n11_fractional_certificate/` run on any CPython 3.12 or later by design.
Python, Rust, and research validation are documented in
[`development.md`](development.md); **the five validation tiers and the three behavioral
lanes are tabulated in
[development.md → Validation Loops](development.md#validation-tiers)**, which is the one
place they are written down.
Read it before changing what runs where.

Run them from `packing/`, which is where the project’s `pyproject.toml` and lockfile
live:

| When | Command |
| --- | --- |
| while editing | `uv run --frozen --all-extras --group dev packing-validate --edit` |
| before any push | `packing-validate --push` — the edit tier plus the tests reachable from the change |
| before touching a registry | `packing-validate --records` |
| what every pull request runs | `packing-validate --fast` |
| at a research or merge checkpoint, and to close a session | the full `packing-validate` |

`OR-13` is the policy behind that split: every fast check runs on the pull-request
surface, and only the unavoidably slow ones leave it, each on its own measurement.
`OR-14` is why the surface is kept quick — a development cycle is never artificially
slow, and its target is two to two and a half minutes.

### The JavaScript and CSS floor

**Biome owns browser formatting and general lint, type-aware ESLint owns the retained
JavaScript promise rules, and `tsc` owns types.** The workbench package and the
JavaScript this repository still serves directly are under the same shape of floor as
Python: zero findings, verify-only in CI, fixed at commit.
The rules come from `tbd guidelines typescript-lint-format-rules`, Profile B, and
`packing/tests/test_browser_floor_contract.py` is what proves they are live rather than
merely written down.

```bash
make hooks-install        # once after cloning: npm ci, then the git hooks
make lint-fix             # fix in place; the commit hook does this for staged files
packing-validate --only "browser floor"   # verify, which is what CI runs
packing-validate --only "browser code lives in files"   # no JavaScript in Python
```

Four things worth knowing before changing any of it:

- **No JavaScript in a Python string, with no exceptions.** Browser code lives in `.js`
  and `.ts` files under Biome and `tsc`, tests and spikes included.
  A Python tool that drives a page loads a probe — one expression per file in a
  `probes/` directory beside the tool — with `sqpack.probes.probe(root, name)`, and
  passes values as its one argument, never by formatting them into the text.
  `devtools.check_no_embedded_js` fails the gate on a script string anywhere, and its
  allowlist in `packing/devtools/embedded-javascript.yaml` is empty.
  [development.md → Browser Code Lives in Files](development.md#browser-code-lives-in-files)
  is how to add a probe.

- `packages/workbench/` is strict TypeScript and uses pinned esbuild to emit classic
  browser bundles. The retained scripts remain checked JavaScript with `allowJs` +
  `checkJs` + `noEmit` and JSDoc types.
  `tsconfig.base.json` holds the shared floor; each retained browser program has its own
  `tsconfig.*.json`, while the package has a strict module program.
  The browser-floor step also runs the package’s Node tests.

- **A relaxed compiler flag names the bead tracking its removal.** That is the ratchet
  from the shared floor’s rule 8, and the contract test fails a config that relaxes one
  without naming a tracker.

- **Formatting the workbench’s script changes the published page’s bytes**, since the
  generator inlines it.
  That is expected; what says the page is unharmed is `check_frontend`, not a hash.

### Markdown formatting

**Flowmark owns all Markdown here.** Do not add Prettier, Biome, or dprint Markdown
handling alongside it — two Markdown formatters churn each other’s output and make hooks
nondeterministic.

Formatting is applied **automatically on commit** by a lefthook `pre-commit` hook, which
formats and re-stages the result (`stage_fixed: true`). You should never need to format
by hand, and unformatted Markdown is not something you can commit by accident.

Formatting drift deliberately **does not fail CI**. It is fixed at commit time instead,
so style never blocks a build.
`make format-check` exists for ad-hoc checking, not as a gate.

Two rules worth knowing before changing any of this:

- **Exclusions are evidence-based, not precautionary.** The policy is to format the
  whole repository and exclude only what we have a tested reason to leave raw.
  The exclusions, each with its reason in `.flowmarkignore`: the literature archive
  under `packing/resources/`; generated files, from the `SKILL.md` files to the rendered
  registers and the claim documents, whose own renderers drift-check them; two dated
  reviews whose quoted sources the formatter would retype; the contributed strategy
  review whose preserved source body is digest-bound; and the vendored submodules.
  The archive is excluded for two measured reasons: the `.raw.md` extractions are
  byte-level ground truth and the formatter rewrites them (about 2,600 lines across two
  files), and formatting the transcriptions would change transcribed characters — smart
  quotes, ellipses — against the rule that archived source is never edited to look tidy.
  Math is not a reason: the pinned `flowmark-rs==0.4.0` keeps every one of the archive’s
  7,618 `$...$` spans whole, and
  `uv run --frozen --group dev python -m devtools.check_math_spans FILE...` from
  `packing/` re-measures that on a copy of any file with the `Makefile`’s pinned
  command, reporting every span that changed, gained a newline, or went missing.
  Do not drop or narrow the exclusion without re-measuring.
- **The hook formats the whole repository, not the staged files.** Flowmark reads
  `.flowmarkignore` relative to its target argument, so passing explicit paths silently
  bypasses the exclusion list.
  That matters here: `.flowmarkignore` protects `packing/resources/`, where the
  `.raw.md` extractions are byte-level ground truth used to check the model-assisted
  transcriptions against.
  Reflowing them would void that guarantee.
  Do not “optimise” the hook to `{staged_files}`.
- **The flowmark version is pinned** in the `Makefile` (currently the latest Rust build,
  `flowmark-rs==0.4.0` — the Rust port is the fast one).
  Pinned rather than floating so it is not an unpinned zero-install runner, which
  `tbd guidelines supply-chain-hardening` rule 6 warns against.
  Bumping the pin is a deliberate, reviewable change.

Emergency bypass: `git commit --no-verify` (avoid in PRs).

## Architecture Overview

The repository is split by audience rather than by topic.

**The root holds what a reader wants**, where it is visible on arrival:
[`README.md`](README.md) as the front door, then [`TUTORIAL.md`](TUTORIAL.md),
[`SYNOPSIS.md`](SYNOPSIS.md), [`conventions.md`](conventions.md),
[`development.md`](development.md), the generated [`defects.md`](defects.md), and
`docs/project/` for reports, reviews, specs and postmortems.

**[`packing/`](packing/) holds the general library, data, and research record**: the
`sqpack` package and its tests, the developer tools, the Rust search engine, the
literature archive, the frontier register, the atlas, the witnesses, and the campaign.
The interactive product is the focused exception: strict browser source, probes, tests,
and build tools live in [`packages/workbench/`](packages/workbench/). The Python build
root remains `packing/`, where `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock` and `.python-version` live.

Two rules follow from the split, and both exist because a path now has two plausible
meanings:

- **Every declared path in the record is repository-relative.** That covers
  `recorded_in` in `packing/defects.yaml`, the document map, the logbook’s
  pipeline-change paths, and the verified-upper-bound consumer contract.
  One root, one meaning, and a path that reads the same wherever it appears.
  A packing-relative path in any of those places is a bug.
- **Python path constants name which root they mean.** `ROOT` (also `PROJECT_ROOT`,
  `PACKING`) is `packing/`; `REPO` is the repository root.
  A constant pointing at a document that lives at the root resolves from `REPO`.
  `sqpack` itself finds the project by marker discovery rather than a fixed depth, so it
  does not care where the checkout sits.

The standalone research reports this repository once carried, on topics unrelated to
packing, live in [jlevy/thinking](https://github.com/jlevy/thinking).

## Conventions & Patterns

- **The project is self-contained.** Its documents, sources, and code live in this
  repository and link to each other with relative paths.
  Reader-facing prose belongs at the root; general code, data, and the research record
  belong under `packing/`; the workbench product belongs under `packages/workbench/`.
- **Reports separate claims by evidential status** — proved, computationally verified,
  best known, or asserted-but-unverified — and cite primary sources near the claims they
  support.
- **How work is conducted is not in this file.** Workflow entry points, session slicing,
  sub-agent use, and the rest are [`operating-rules.md`](operating-rules.md); the
  summary above is the whole of what belongs here.
- **Archived source material is never edited to look tidy.** Where a transcription
  reconstructs damaged text, it is flagged inline and counted in the archive README.

<!-- BEGIN FLOWMARK INTEGRATION format=f03 surface=agents-md -->
## flowmark

Auto-format Markdown with `flowmark` for clean, semantic git diffs.

- Run `flowmark --auto <files>` on Markdown you create or edit.
- Run `flowmark --docs` for full usage and `flowmark --skill` for the skill.
- If `flowmark` is not on `PATH`, use a pinned `uvx` runner (never `@latest`).
- Fast Rust port (recommended): `uvx --from flowmark-rs==0.4.0 flowmark`.
- Python build (library / newest patch): `uvx --from flowmark==0.8.0 flowmark`.

<!-- BEGIN PPROSE INTEGRATION format=f02 -->
## Practical Prose (pprose)

Practical Prose: an evaluation toolkit and editorial workflows for practical documents.
Use when the user asks to improve, audit, score, or compare practical documents.

For durable Markdown documentation, use `pprose-common-edit` whenever creating, editing,
reviewing, or reorganizing it, unless the task is explicitly read-only.
Keep the required guideline footer intact.

Apply AI-slop reduction whenever drafting or editing prose, not only on request: use
`pprose-de-slop` to remove AI-writing tells and formulaic LLM prose, applying its
bundled catalog contextually and preserving meaning and voice.

Discover the tool from the CLI itself: `pprose --help` for commands, `pprose about` for
the project narrative, `pprose skill` for the workflow skills, and `pprose list` for
every on-demand guideline, shortcut, and runbook
(`pprose guidelines|shortcut|runbook <name>` prints one).

Run pprose as `pprose <command>` if on PATH, else `uvx pprose@0.4.0 <command>`
(zero-install via uv).
