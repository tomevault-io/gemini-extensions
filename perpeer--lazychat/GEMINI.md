# lazychat — working in this app

A Go 1.26 + Bubble Tea v1 TUI. `README.md` is the short tour for users;
`docs/REFERENCE.md` is the reference — every screen, key and file — and
`CONTRIBUTING.md` the code map, how to change it and the tests. This file
only says how to change the code without breaking it. Read
CONTRIBUTING.md's `## Code` section before a structural change.

## Public repository

This repository is public. Nothing from the machine it is worked on goes
into it — not into files, tests, examples, comments, commit messages or
commit metadata: no project, workspace, session or branch names, ticket
keys, paths, user names, e-mail addresses or terminal setups seen there,
not even as a test fixture. Make examples up, and make them look like
nothing real (`garden-shed-paints/feature/blue-door`). Commits use the
repository's own `user.name` and `user.email` (`git config --local`),
never a machine's global identity; check `git log -1 --format='%an <%ae>'`
before a push. Something found later is removed from the history too,
before it is pushed.

## Layers

Each imports only what is below it; the layers rule of `./check.sh`
enforces the lines, so a wrong import fails the check.

- `internal/ui` — the shell: tabs, rail, footer, popups, key and mouse
  routing, the key log.
- `internal/ui/<tab>` — a tab: `<tab>.go` (the struct, `kit.Tab`),
  `update.go` (keys, mouse, messages → operations), `view*.go` (drawing
  only), `keymap.go` (every key, in `kit.Binding` tables), `host.go` (the
  actions' `Host`).
- `internal/ui/<tab>/model` — the tab's state and the operations on it.
  No Bubble Tea, no styling, no kit.
- `internal/ui/<tab>/actions` — what keys do with core, behind `Host`. No
  Bubble Tea, no styling.
- `internal/ui/kit` — shared parts; `internal/ui/vm` — shared plain-Go
  state (the list cursor).
- `internal/term` — the only package that touches ptys and the emulator.
- `internal/core` — state, workspaces, history, AI tools (`agent`), session
  status (`status`), Claude's usage (`usage`), `api`. No terminal
  packages; `api` runs no subprocess.
- `macos/Lazychat` — the menu bar app, Swift. The app is Lazychat; Lazy is
  only the mascot.

## Write it once

- A program in a pane holding the keys is `kit.Capture` — capture and
  release, the leave key, kitty mode, typed bytes, raw mouse, the click
  beside the pane. A tab never writes its own focus switch.
- What a mouse event is over is `kit.Hits`. A tab never loops over zones.
- Colours come from `kit.Theme`. A key's keys and words come from
  `kit/keys.go`, its action from the tab's `keymap.go`, which also feeds
  the footer and `?` help.
- A tab with projects and a program's pane embeds `kit.PaneTab`; a
  project tree is drawn with `kit.DrawTree`.
- Files are read and written through `internal/core/files` alone; every
  test package's TestMain calls `testenv.Main`.
- What a session is doing — working, done, looked at, asking, its turn,
  what calls first — is `status.Board`. A tool adds its signals through
  its capabilities; nothing else derives a state.
- A difference between tabs that should not exist is a bug in the shared
  part's use, not a reason for a second copy.

## Traps

- Never `program.Send` inside `Update`; from a goroutine use `Screen.Send`.
  A hook that runs under the emulator's lock (`OnKitty`) sends from a new
  goroutine.
- Every tab gets every unknown message; a message meant for one owner
  carries it (see `kit.Capture`'s messages).
- Bubble Tea v1 drops kitty `CSI … u` keys; the input router turns text
  reports back into characters. A key that does nothing: read the key log
  in the status area, the footer's last row before the version, first.
- Zones are one global manager: tests in `internal/ui` never run in
  parallel.

## Rules by area

`.claude/rules/` holds what each area has learned, loaded when its files
are read; add a rule there, with its why, when a change settles one.

| File | Area |
| --- | --- |
| `session-status.md` | the board, its states and orders, the Swift mirror |
| `menu-bar.md` | Lazychat.app, the state files, clicks, permissions |
| `ai-tools.md` | the tool gateway, the claude overlay, resume |
| `workspaces.md` | locks, switching in place, broken files |
| `git-tab.md` | push, pull, branch, what git may never do |
| `keys-and-layout.md` | leave key, footers, widths |
| `tests.md` | the test layers' traps |
| `install.md` | install and uninstall, nothing legacy |
| `report.md` | Chat's report tab, the usage parser, what a prompt spent |

## Tests

`go test ./...`, three layers (CONTRIBUTING.md `### Tests`): unit tests next to
each package, model tests without a screen, screen tests in
`internal/ui/*_screen_test.go` through the driver in `driver_test.go`,
and `cmd/lazychat/pty_test.go` for what needs a real terminal. Every step
waits for the text it expects, never for a fixed time. A behaviour change
comes with a screen-test step; a refactor changes no existing test.

## Flow

From the repo root: `./check.sh` (gofmt, vet, the layers, tests; `--fast`
skips the tests — it names what to fix), commit locally, then
`./install.sh`, which builds `~/.local/bin/lazychat`. Never push. Comments
follow `~/.claude/rules/comments.md`: the why, in English, never the what.

## Version

This project only. The version is the release number GitHub gives this
commit: the newest `vX.Y.Z` tag's next patch (`packaging/next-version.sh`;
`[minor]` or `[major]` in a commit message since the tag moves those), or
the tag's own number on a tagged commit. `./install.sh` stamps it into the
binary with the short hash (`1.0.3 d9f8a5b`, `-dirty.<hash>` on the hash
when the tree has uncommitted changes); nothing holds it by hand, so a
commit never edits a version file. It shows as `v1.0.3` at the screen's
bottom-right corner and on the splash, with the hash in `lazychat
--version`. The tags are read locally: a list behind GitHub's gives a
lower number, `git fetch --tags` fixes it. install.sh also stamps
`releaseTag`, the newest tag the checkout is past, which the newer-release
check compares from — so a build saying v1.0.3 while 1.0.2 is the newest
release shows no `↑`. Releases are tags `vX.Y.Z`. A push to main that
changes what users run (cmd, internal, macos, go.mod/sum, the formula)
releases itself (`.github/workflows/release.yml`): `./check.sh` on a Mac,
the next version, the tag, a GitHub release with the commits as notes, and
the tap's formula (github.com/Perpeer/homebrew-tap, with the
`HOMEBREW_TAP_TOKEN` secret). Nothing is committed back to main. By hand:
`./release.sh X.Y.Z` tags here, `./release.sh --formula X.Y.Z` writes the
tap (`../homebrew-tap`); pushing is the user's. Homebrew's build stamps
`X.Y.Z` through the same `-X main.version`. `./install.sh --brew` installs
through Homebrew from this checkout (a local tap, version `X.Y.Z-dev`, the
next release's) to test the formula.

## iCloud

The repo lives in iCloud Drive and two devices sync it. When git reports
missing or bad objects, look for iCloud's copies inside `.git`
(`find .git -name "* [0-9]*"`: `objects/30 2`, `index 2`): after a backup
of `.git`, move each object back into its own folder when that one lacks
it, then delete the copies. Two devices committing the same branch
diverge; which side is kept is the user's call. `./sync-wait.sh` waits
until iCloud has sent or fetched everything under the checkout (macOS
cannot be made to sync now): run it after a commit or an install, and
before work on the other Mac.
