## Project Overview

Brainkit is a second-brain plugin for AI coding agents. It runs against three harnesses — OpenCode, GitHub Copilot CLI, and Claude Code — and provides a structured markdown vault organized with the PARA method, with skills that teach the agent domain knowledge and (on OpenCode) a TUI that keeps you connected to your vault.

Design specs live in `specs/`. Feature definitions live in `docs/features.md`. Read them before making architectural decisions.

### Dev-Side vs Client-Side

This repo contains two kinds of agentic files — it's important to know which is which:

- **Dev-side**: Files that guide AI agents working on brainkit's own codebase. These shape how _you_ (the agent helping the developer) behave when contributing to this repo.
  - `AGENTS.md` (this file)
  - `.opencode/` (dev OpenCode config)

- **Client-side**: Files that brainkit delivers to its users at runtime. These shape how the agent behaves inside a user's OpenCode session when brainkit is installed as a plugin.
  - `skills/` (domain knowledge injected into the user's agent)
  - `core/system-prompt.ts` (builds the system prompt for the user's session)
  - `opencode/server.ts` (hooks that inject client-side behavior)

When editing client-side files, you're changing the experience for brainkit's end users, not your own behavior. When editing dev-side files, you're changing how agents work on this repo.

### Development Commands

All actions use [just](https://just.systems/). Run `just` to list all available recipes.

```bash
just            # list all recipes
just oc         # launch OpenCode against the dev brainkit (full pipeline)
just cp         # launch Copilot CLI against the dev brainkit (alias: just ghcp)
just cc         # launch Claude Code against the dev brainkit
just test       # run tests
just test-watch # run tests in watch mode
just lint       # eslint + typecheck
just format     # format with prettier
just check      # lint + format check + test (run before committing)
just build-cli  # compile CLI to dist/ for npm publishing
```

### Running

Brainkit ships as an npm package consumed by three harnesses (OpenCode, Copilot CLI, Claude Code). For local development, use the harness recipes:

```bash
just oc         # OpenCode + dev brainkit
just cp         # Copilot CLI + dev brainkit
just cc         # Claude Code + dev brainkit
```

Each recipe rebuilds the npm tarball (full `prepack`: tsc + shim generator), installs it into `.dev/install/`, and launches the harness using the dev binary. Your real `~/.config/brainkit/` is untouched — dev state lives under `.dev/user-config/`. See `CONTRIBUTING.md` § Testing your changes against a real harness for details.

### CLI (for npm)

```bash
just build-cli    # compile TypeScript to dist/
node dist/cli/index.js --help  # test locally
```

### Testing

```bash
just test       # run once
just test-watch # watch mode
```

Tests live in `__tests__/` directories alongside source. Each test file maps to a module.

## Core Principles

### Plan Before You Code

- Read relevant specs in `specs/` and `docs/features.md` before touching architecture
- Break complex tasks into smaller steps
- If requirements are unclear, ask first

### Ask, Don't Assume

- When multiple approaches exist, present options with trade-offs
- Don't guess at user preferences or business logic
- Clarify scope before making architectural decisions

### Single Responsibility & Small Files

- Each function does one thing
- Each module has one concern (`vault.ts` = vault ops, `server.ts` = server plugin, etc.)
- If a file is doing two things, split it
- Keep files under ~500 lines where possible

### DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

- Extract shared logic into reusable functions
- But don't over-abstract — wait for the pattern to appear three times before extracting
- If duplicating code intentionally, explain why
- Shared logic between CLI and plugin goes in `core/`

### KISS (Keep It Simple)

- Prefer simple solutions over clever ones
- Avoid premature abstraction
- If a solution feels complex, step back and reconsider
- If deviating from simplicity, explain why to the user

### Testing

- High coverage with isolated unit tests
- Each test validates one atomic behavior
- Test the module's public API, not internal implementation
- Mock external dependencies (filesystem, network)
- Tests should be fast, deterministic, and independent of each other

### Cross-Platform

- Code must work on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- Use `node:path` (`path.join`, `path.resolve`) instead of hardcoded `/` separators
- Use `node:os` (`os.homedir()`, `os.tmpdir()`, `os.platform()`) instead of assuming Unix conventions
- Never hardcode paths like `/home/`, `~/.config/`, or `C:\` — derive them from platform APIs
- Be aware of case-sensitive vs case-insensitive filesystems
- Use `node:child_process` with `shell: true` carefully — shell syntax differs across platforms
- Test path-sensitive logic with both `/` and `\` separators in mind
- CI runs tests on Windows (`test-windows` job) — OS-sensitive code (especially `cli/` and `core/vault.ts`) must have test coverage that will surface failures there
- Avoid OS-specific assertions in tests (e.g. exact path strings with `/`); use `path.join` or `path.sep`-aware comparisons

### Security

- Never store secrets in code, logs, or error messages
- Validate all inputs — tool parameters, file paths, config values
- Path traversal protection on all vault file operations
- Never expose vault content outside the plugin context
- When in doubt, choose the more secure option

### Harness Config Isolation (non-negotiable)

Brainkit must **never** modify the user's normal harness configuration. When brainkit launches a harness, it must use its own dedicated, isolated config so the user's regular setup is untouched and unaffected.

- **OpenCode**: launch with `OPENCODE_CONFIG` and `OPENCODE_TUI_CONFIG` pointing at `~/.config/brainkit/{opencode,tui}.json`, plus `OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR=~/.config/brainkit/` and `OPENCODE_DISABLE_PROJECT_CONFIG=true` to block dotfiles-dir and project-walk leaks. Write only the minimum fields brainkit owns (`$schema`, `plugin`, conditional `permission`); do not merge in values from the user's `~/.config/opencode/` — OpenCode does that itself at load time, with brainkit's overrides winning on conflict. Plugins must not call APIs that mutate OpenCode's persisted state (e.g. `api.theme.set`) or that write outside the brainkit config dir (e.g. `api.theme.install` for global plugins, which copies the theme file into `<XDG_CONFIG_HOME>/opencode/themes/` — `OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR` does not redirect this); declare configuration in the brainkit-owned files instead. Use `writeIfChanged` so unchanged config preserves mtime. Never read or write `~/.config/opencode/`.
- **Copilot CLI**: launch with `COPILOT_HOME` env var pointing at `~/.config/brainkit/copilot/`. Never read, write, or merge into `~/.copilot/` (the user's global Copilot config). The vault is the agent's `cwd` but brainkit must not write any files inside the vault. The launcher must reject `--config-dir` in user args (it would override `COPILOT_HOME` per Copilot's precedence rules and defeat isolation). The `COPILOT_CUSTOM_INSTRUCTIONS_DIRS` env var, if set by the user, is left alone. The only exception to the "no vault writes" rule is the one-time mechanical migration that removes legacy brainkit-generated files from vaults created with prior brainkit versions.
- **Claude Code**: launch with `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` env var pointing at `~/.config/brainkit/claude/`. Never read or write `~/.claude/` (the user's global Claude config). Never write to `<pkgRoot>/claude/` — it is a read-only template; copy it into `~/.config/brainkit/claude/plugin/` at launch instead.
- Any new harness integration must follow the same rule: use env vars, dedicated config dirs, or vault-scoped files. Never mutate the user's global harness config or installed plugins/extensions.
- If a feature seems to require touching the user's harness config, stop and discuss it first — there is almost always a sandboxed alternative.
- Add tests when adding harness integration code to confirm no writes happen outside the brainkit config dir or the vault.

### Minimal Dependencies

- Avoid adding dependencies unless they make things genuinely simpler
- Prefer Node.js built-ins (`node:fs`, `node:path`, `node:os`) over npm packages
- Before adding a dependency, check if the functionality exists in the stdlib or current deps
- **Adding a new dependency requires explicit user approval**
- Current runtime dependency: `smol-toml` (TOML parsing). That's it.

---

## Code Style

- TypeScript, strict mode
- ESM imports
- `.js` extension for local imports in `core/` and `cli/` (Node/jiti resolution)
- `.ts`/`.tsx` extensions for imports in `opencode/` (bun resolution)
- `import type` for type-only imports
- No `any` unless truly unavoidable
- Naming: `camelCase` for functions/variables, `PascalCase` for types/interfaces, `UPPER_SNAKE` for constants

---

## Package Architecture

The repo publishes a single npm package: `@2brain/brainkit`.

| Directory   | What it contains                               |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `core/`     | Vault ops, system prompt, types. No UI deps.   |
| `cli/`      | CLI entry point, compiled to `dist/` for npm   |
| `opencode/` | OpenCode plugin (server + TUI). Ships raw TS.  |
| `skills/`   | Markdown domain knowledge for the user's agent |

Runtime dependency: `smol-toml` (TOML parsing). Optional peer deps on OpenCode packages (`@opencode-ai/plugin`, `@opentui/core`, `@opentui/solid`, `solid-js`).

---

## OpenCode Plugin API

Official docs: https://opencode.ai/docs (plugins, agents, config, SDK sections).

OpenCode plugins export a server function and/or TUI function. The package exports these via:

```json
{
  "exports": {
    "./server": { "import": "./opencode/server.ts" },
    "./tui": { "import": "./opencode/tui.tsx" }
  }
}
```

### Server plugin patterns

```typescript
import type { ServerPlugin } from "@opencode-ai/plugin/server"

export default ((api) => {
  // System prompt injection
  api.hook("experimental.chat.system.transform", (system) => {
    return system + "\n" + buildSystemPrompt()
  })

  // Event handling
  api.event("session.idle", async (event) => { ... })

  // Compaction hook
  api.hook("experimental.session.compacting", (summary) => {
    return summary + "\n" + condensedVaultContext()
  })
}) satisfies ServerPlugin
```

### TUI plugin patterns

```tsx
/** @jsxImportSource @opentui/solid */
import type { TuiPlugin } from "@opencode-ai/plugin/tui"

export default ((api) => {
  // Home screen slots
  api.slot("home_logo", () => <BrainAsciiArt />)
  api.slot("home_bottom", () => <RotatingTips />)
  api.slot("sidebar_content", () => <VaultStats />)

  // Theme
  api.theme.register("brainkit", brainkitTheme)

  // Commands
  api.command({ title: "/doctor", slash: { name: "doctor" }, onSelect() { ... } })
}) satisfies TuiPlugin
```

### Key differences from a standalone app

- OpenCode loads `.ts`/`.tsx` files directly via bun — no build step for the plugin
- The TUI uses solid-js with JSX (`@opentui/solid`)
- `opencode/tsconfig.json` exists for type-checking only (`jsx: preserve`)
- Server plugins have full filesystem/process access (can run git, read files, etc.)
- Reference implementation: `.reference/oc-plugin-vault-tec/` (gitignored, clone from GitHub if needed)

---

## CLI Architecture

The `brainkit` CLI (`cli/index.ts`) is a thin launcher:

1. **Harness aliases** (checked first): `oc`, `opencode` → launch OpenCode with plugin
2. **Auto-detect** (bare `brainkit`): find OpenCode on `$PATH`, launch it

There are no subcommands (no init, update, etc.) — vault setup and all operations happen inside the harness, guided by the plugin's client-side system prompt and skills.

The launcher (`cli/launch.ts`) creates config files at `~/.config/brainkit/` and spawns `opencode` with `OPENCODE_CONFIG` and `OPENCODE_TUI_CONFIG` env vars set. OpenCode merges these with the user's existing config.

---

## Vault Operations

All vault logic lives in `core/`. Key patterns:

- `readGlobalConfig()` — reads `~/.config/brainkit/config.toml` (just `brain_path`)
- `discoverVaults()` — scans brain directory for vault subdirectories
- `readVaultConfig()` — reads `brainkit.toml` from the vault (user info, features)
- `readBragfile()` / `appendBragEntry()` — bragfile operations
- `readContacts()` / `searchContacts()` / `addContact()` — contact operations
- `buildSystemPrompt()` — constructs the system prompt from vault state
- `containsUserAccomplishment()` — detects accomplishment keywords in text
- `runHealthChecks()` — vault doctor diagnostics

All file operations validate paths are within the vault boundary (path traversal protection). Current implementation uses synchronous fs — flagged as tech debt for async migration.

---

## Releasing

**Never publish to npm manually.** Publishing happens automatically via GitHub Actions when a release PR is merged to `main`. See `CONTRIBUTING.md` § Releasing for the full process — version bump, changelog, PR, CI publish.

### Changelog style

Changelog entries are user-facing — describe what changed, not how. Keep each entry to one concise line. Don't mention internal function names, file paths, or refactors unless they're the point of the change.
