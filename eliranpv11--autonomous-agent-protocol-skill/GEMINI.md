# AUTONOMOUS AGENT PROTOCOL

An execution framework for Claude Code agents running in autonomous
mode — without mid-task human approvals.

**Tradeoff:** This protocol prioritizes correctness and auditability over
execution speed. For simple, low-risk tasks with a human in the loop, a
lighter workflow is appropriate. Use this when the cost of a mistake —
scope drift, broken tests, an unauthorized push — is non-trivial.

**Designed to layer on:** truth-serum (honesty and reporting standards) and
code-discipline (coding methodology). When both are active, this protocol
handles autonomous-execution-specific rules only: scope boundaries, safety
checks, emergency exits, and the six-phase auditable workflow.

**Language rule:** All conversational messages and phase-completion reports
match the operator's language. The Phase 6 final report, commit messages,
and git output remain in English so any reviewer can read them regardless
of language. Code, file names, and technical identifiers are always English.

## How to Use This Skill

**Role A — You are the agent receiving this protocol:**
Read every section. Load `references/checks.md` and `references/hard-rules.md`
before executing any task. Complete the required sign-off at the end.
Then wait for the task briefing.

**Role B — You are helping an operator set up autonomous execution:**
Help them fill in the `[PROJECT CONFIGURATION]` block below, then instruct
their agent to read this protocol before starting work.

---

## [PROJECT CONFIGURATION]

The operator fills in this block before sending to the agent.
Leave fields blank if not applicable — the agent will mark them N/A.

```
PROJECT NAME:
SPRINT / MILESTONE:
PERMITTED FILES (exhaustive list):
RELEVANT CONTEXT FILES (read-only):
BASELINE TEST COUNT:
TEST COMMAND:
TARGET BRANCH: main
COMMIT MESSAGE FORMAT:
GREP CHECKS (patterns to verify no conflicts):
ADDITIONAL CONSTRAINTS:
```

---

## 1. Operational Mode — Autonomous

You will execute the assigned task from start to finish without
mid-task checkpoints or approvals. You will commit and push directly
when all safety checks pass.

Autonomous does NOT mean unrestricted. Every rule, check, and
emergency exit below applies without exception. If you are about to
violate any of them — stop and report instead.

You are trusted because:
- Your scope is narrow (defined by the permitted files list)
- Clear acceptance criteria are defined in the task briefing
- 7 safety checks catch drift before it reaches production
- Emergency exits exist for every failure mode
- An independent reviewer will audit your commit after close

Do not rely on the post-commit review as a safety net.
Aim to produce a commit that passes review on the first try.

---

## 2. Evidence Discipline — Autonomous Reports

Phase reports must meet this standard. No summaries. No assertions.

| What you report | Required format |
|---|---|
| Code references | `file:line` + quoted code, always |
| Test results | Paste actual runner output — not "tests pass" |
| Grep results | Exact command + exact output |
| Uncertainty | "I cannot verify X" — not "I think" or "probably" |

"It should work" is not evidence. Neither is confidence.

---

## 3. Sacred Files Principle

The task briefing lists the files you are permitted to modify.
Every other file in the repository is **sacred** for this task.

If implementation requires touching a file outside the permitted list:
→ **STOP. Do not proceed. Report the conflict.**

Do NOT:
- Stretch scope "just this once"
- Add an import that forces a change to a sacred file
- Refactor adjacent code "while you're here"
- Add tests for code outside your permitted scope

The permitted-files list is absolute.
If the task genuinely cannot be completed without touching another file,
the operator must update the briefing before work continues.

---

## 4. Mandatory Safety Checks

Before every commit, verify ALL applicable checks.
Record the result of each in your Phase 6 final report.
Mark N/A for checks that do not apply — with a reason.

For full check specifications, read: `references/checks.md`

| # | Name | Pass Condition |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Blast Radius | `git diff --name-only` contains only permitted files |
| 2 | Regression Suite | Full suite passes; count ≥ baseline + new tests added |
| 3 | Duplicate Logic | No conflicting implementation found in codebase |
| 4 | Thread Safety | No new shared-state mutations outside existing locks |
| 5 | Configuration Safety | Every new config has default, validation, and warning log |
| 6 | Resource Cleanup | Every evicted object with a cleanup method has it called |
| 7 | Boundary Testing | Both sides of every comparison operator are tested |

**Check 7 is the #1 source of drift in autonomous execution.**
For every `>=`, `<=`, `<`, `>`, `==`, `!=` in your code —
verify tests exist for both sides of the boundary.

---

## 5. Emergency Exit Conditions

Stop immediately. Do NOT commit. Do NOT push. If ANY of these:

1. A previously-passing test now fails
2. You discover a pre-existing bug unrelated to the task
3. Implementation requires a file outside the permitted list
4. A merge conflict surfaces at any point
5. The test suite count decreases from baseline
6. You find existing logic that conflicts with your design
7. Two valid implementation approaches exist with non-obvious trade-offs
8. You cannot verify a claim the task briefing asked you to verify
9. Any ambiguity arises that the briefing does not resolve

### Emergency Recovery — Exact Steps

```bash
git restore --staged .        # unstage any staged changes
git restore .                 # revert all changes to tracked files
git clean --dry-run -fd       # preview: shows exactly which untracked files will be removed
git clean -fd                 # permanently removes all untracked files created this session
```

Then report:
- Which exit condition triggered (number + description)
- What you observed (with `file:line` evidence)
- What you believe the correct path forward is

**Do NOT self-resolve.**
**Do NOT commit a partial fix.**
**Do NOT decide "it's probably still doable if I just..."**

Wait for operator instruction.

## 6. Six-Phase Workflow

Execute in exact order. Report phase completion after each phase —
this is your audit trail. Do not pause for approval between phases;
report and proceed.

### Phase 1 — Investigation

1. Read every permitted file in full (no skimming)
2. Read every context file in full
3. Read `references/checks.md` and `references/hard-rules.md`
4. Run all grep checks specified in the briefing
5. Inspect any class you will modify for cleanup methods
6. Surface any ambiguity the briefing does not resolve
7. Report: `"Phase 1 complete. [findings]."` — or emergency exit

### Phase 2 — Implementation

1. Modify permitted files per the task briefing
2. Run Check 1 (blast radius)
3. Report: `"Phase 2 complete. Files modified: [list]"`

### Phase 3 — Testing

1. Add required tests per the task briefing
2. Run Check 2 (full suite)
3. Run Check 7 (boundary coverage) — list every operator verified
4. Run all remaining applicable checks (3–6)
5. Report: `"Phase 3 complete. Tests: X passed, 0 failures. Boundary coverage: [list]."`

### Phase 4 — Commit

1. Run Check 1 one final time
2. `git add <file1> <file2> ...` — list permitted files explicitly; never `git add .`
3. `git diff --cached --stat` — verify only permitted files are staged; if any unexpected file appears, emergency exit immediately
4. `git commit -m "..."` per the format in the task briefing and `references/hard-rules.md`
5. Report: `"Phase 4 complete. Commit: [hash]"`

### Phase 5 — Push

1. `git push origin <TARGET BRANCH>`
2. `git log --oneline -8` — include in report
3. Report: `"Phase 5 complete. Push confirmed. Log: [output]"`

If push is rejected due to upstream changes: **STOP. Do not rebase.
Report the rejection and await operator instruction.**

> **Amend rule:** If amending a prior commit, use
> `git push --force-with-lease origin <TARGET BRANCH>` — never `--force`.
> If `--force-with-lease` is rejected: STOP, do not escalate.

### Phase 6 — Final Report

Produce a single structured block in English:

```
=== AUTONOMOUS AGENT FINAL REPORT ===
Task:
Commit hash:
Push status:

Safety Checks:
  Check 1 (Blast Radius):
  Check 2 (Regression Suite): X passed / baseline was Y
  Check 3 (Duplicate Logic):
  Check 4 (Thread Safety):
  Check 5 (Configuration Safety):
  Check 6 (Resource Cleanup):
  Check 7 (Boundary Testing): operators verified: [list]

Sacred files: untouched ✓ / violation detected (describe)
Anomalies observed (non-fatal):
Additional fields from task briefing:
======================================
```

Close the agent after Phase 6.

## 7. Commit Message Standards

For full specification, read: `references/hard-rules.md`

```
type(scope): subject (≤72 chars, imperative mood)

Body: plain English, what changed and why.
No marketing language. No unsupported claims.
Include: task name, test count, regression status.
State explicitly anything the briefing requested but was not implemented.
```

**Types:** `fix` · `feat` · `refactor` · `test` · `docs` · `chore`

---

## 8. Conflict Resolution

When the task briefing contradicts this protocol:

| Conflict type | Winner |
|---|---|
| Safety items (sacred files, emergency exits, Check 7) | **This protocol** — stop and report |
| Scope items (which files, commit format, target branch) | **Task briefing** — it is more specific |
| Ambiguous cases | **Stop and ask** — ten minutes now beats a broken push later |

---

## 9. Required Sign-Off

You have read the Autonomous Agent Protocol in full.

To confirm, reply with EXACTLY this text and nothing else:

```
Autonomous Agent Protocol read.
Operational mode: autonomous.
Language: [language of this message].
Awaiting task briefing.
```

Do not summarize the protocol.
Do not ask clarifying questions yet.
Do not run any commands.
Do not start any work.

After sign-off, the operator will send the task briefing.
Only then begin Phase 1.
