# AGENTS.md

Entry point for coding agents working on KeeForge. This file is intentionally brief; most useful guidance now lives in folder-local `README.md` files next to the code.

## High level guidance

- Do not preserve backward compatibility unless required by the existing install base. Remove obsolete paths instead of adding compatibility layers, fallbacks, or migrations.
- Choose the simplest implementation that fully meets the current requirements. Avoid speculative abstractions, configuration, and indirection.
- Grow the system in layers. Start from the smallest version that works end to end, and add each new capability on top of a product that already works. Never trade a working product for unfinished complexity.
- Keep components modular and concerns clearly separated.
- Prefer established, well-maintained libraries when they reduce overall complexity or improve reliability. Do not reimplement common functionality without a clear reason.
- Lean on the dependencies already in the project before writing your own implementation or adding packages. Do not assume a library lacks a capability without checking its documentation and types.
- Make architectural decisions for the long term. Do not accept a stopgap that only works for now and is meant to be replaced later.

## Project Snapshot

- Native iOS KeePass manager for KDBX 4.x databases; also reads KDBX 3.1 (read-only)
- Swift 6, SwiftUI, iOS 18+ / macOS 14+, `@Observable`, strict concurrency
- XcodeGen build graph: edit `project.yml`, then regenerate `KeeForge.xcodeproj`
- Main targets: `KeeForge`, `KeeForgeMac`, `KeeForgeAutoFill`, `KeeForgeMacAutoFill`, `KeeForgeTests`, `KeeForgeMacTests`, `KeeForgeUITests`, `KeeForgeMacUITests`. The macOS targets are ON HOLD and must not ship (see CHANGELOG.md's "## macOS App" section).

## Open The Local Doc First

- `KeeForge/README.md` — app-target map and cross-cutting flows
- `KeeForge/App/README.md` — app lifecycle, root navigation, scene handling
- `KeeForge/Models/README.md` — parser, writer, edit-draft, and core data-model guidance
- `KeeForge/Services/README.md` — storage, local save, cloud sync, keychain, bookmarks, device integrations
- `KeeForge/Services/{AppSupport,AutoFill,Cloud,Persistence,Security}/README.md` — per-subfolder service maps and constraints
- `KeeForge/ViewModels/README.md` — list, unlock, save, search, sort, and TOTP state ownership
- `KeeForge/Views/README.md` — screen ownership and UI/testing conventions
- `KeeForge/Extensions/README.md` — shared Swift extension helpers
- `KeeForge/Resources/README.md` — string catalogs, assets, and resource conventions
- `KeeForgeMac/README.md` — macOS target constraints
- `AutoFillExtension/README.md` — extension constraints and shared-source notes
- `KeeForgeTests/README.md` — unit-test map and selection rules
- `KeeForgeUITests/README.md` — XCUITest workflow and flake-avoidance guidance
- `KeeForgeMacUITests/README.md` — macOS XCUITest workflow
- `TestFixtures/README.md` — bundled databases, passwords, and key files
- `Vendor/KeeForgeTwofish/README.md` — vendored Twofish cipher package
- `ci_scripts/README.md` — Xcode Cloud bootstrap and `run_kdbx_compatibility_gate.sh`, the required local release gate
- `scripts/README.md` — local dev tooling
- `.github/AGENTS.md` — CI workflow gating map (named `AGENTS.md` because GitHub renders a `.github/README.md` as the repo front-page README)
- `docs/README.md` — historical archive of past design specs, audits, and notes (may not match current code), except `docs/macos-security-notes.md`, a living doc kept truthful with the code

## Agent Orchestration

If you are a very powerful model like Fable/Opus/GPT 5.6 Sol, feel free to delegate implementation and test to sub-agents with appropriate models.

Repo skills live in `.agents/skills/` (`release`, `spec-creator`, `publish-app-store-version`), symlinked under `.claude/skills/`; `release` defines the release-branch → TestFlight soak → App Store flow (`release/{major}.{minor}` branches, `rc/{version}-b{build}` candidate tags, `v{version}` as a record of the shipped build).

## Repo-Wide Rules

### Coding Styles

- Use `@Observable`, not `ObservableObject` / `@Published`.
- Use `NavigationStack` + `NavigationPath`, not `NavigationView`.
- Keep crypto, parsing, and secret handling off the main thread.
- Treat these `KeeForge/Models/` files as stable core: `KDBXParser.swift`, `KDBX3Parser.swift`, `KDBXWriter.swift`, `KDBXXMLSerializer.swift`, `KDBXCrypto.swift`, `KDBXOuterCipher.swift`, `OpaqueXMLNodes.swift`, `DatabaseDraft.swift`, `EntryEdit.swift`, `Entry.swift`, `Group.swift`, `EncryptedValue.swift`, `TOTPGenerator.swift`. Change them only for real bugs or intentional format/security work, and add focused tests.
- No force unwraps outside tests.
- Keep comments minimal. A comment is only warranted when the code cannot explain itself — a non-obvious constraint, a format/platform quirk, or the reason behind a surprising choice. Don't restate what the code already says, don't narrate control flow, and don't leave changelog-style notes ("was X, now Y") or review/audit chatter in the source; that belongs in the commit message. Prefer one short line over a paragraph.

### Workflows

- Put temporary agent artifacts such as handoff prompts, investigation notes, and scratch scripts under `scratch/`; it is gitignored and must not contain files intended to ship.
- App and Mac targets use folder globs in `project.yml`, so `xcodegen generate` alone picks up new files. Invariant: the `KeeForgeAutoFill` and `KeeForgeMacAutoFill` allow-lists in `project.yml` must stay byte-identical — edit both together.
- When adding new files, update the nearest folder-local `README.md` if the file changes that folder's map, ownership notes, or workflow guidance.
- Do not update `docs/specs` for new code changes unless explicitly asked. These specs are mostly historical artifacts, not living implementation docs.
- When changing code shared with `AutoFillExtension`, keep extension-safe imports/APIs and target membership in sync.
- When adding or changing database creation, edit operations, KDBX parser/writer behavior, protected fields, unknown XML handling, AutoFill save, cloud save, or local save, update `KeeForgeTests/KDBXCompatibilityTests.swift` and the compatibility artifact gate if the supported compatibility matrix changes.
- Preserve accessibility identifiers or update the relevant UI tests in the same change.
- Update `CHANGELOG.md` for feature or bug-fix commits, only under `## Unreleased` — except macOS-only work, which goes under the top `## macOS App (in development)` section. It's okay to skip if the bug fix is for an unreleased feature.

### Localization

- UI text is localized with Xcode String Catalogs (`.xcstrings`), source language `en`. Currently shipped locales: `en`, `de`, `fr`, `es`, `zh-Hans`, `zh-Hant`.
- Four catalogs: `Localizable.xcstrings` + `InfoPlist.xcstrings` under `KeeForge/Resources/`, mirrored under `AutoFillExtension/`; the same four also serve the macOS targets. Reach user-facing strings via `String(localized:)` (or SwiftUI's automatic catalog lookup) — never hardcode display text.
- Every English key needs a translation in each shipped locale; `KeeForgeTests/LocalizationTests.swift` fails on missing or drifted translations (currently checks `de`, `fr`, `es`, `zh-Hans`, and `zh-Hant`) and also runs in `KeeForgeMacTests`. Run it after touching any catalog.
- When adding a new locale, also translate the root `README.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` (see the `README.*.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.*.md` variants per locale; folder-local READMEs and the rest of the developer docs stay English-only) and the separate `keeforge.com` website repo, which needs the same locale coverage.
- Xcode reserializes `.xcstrings` into its own canonical style on open/build, so editing a catalog as plain JSON causes a large reordering diff next time. After any programmatic catalog edit, run `swift scripts/normalize-xcstrings.swift` (no args = all catalogs; `--check` verifies) so committed bytes match Xcode's.

### Research Notes

- When asked for reference implementations, consult `https://github.com/keepassium/keepassium` and `https://github.com/strongbox-password-safe/Strongbox`.

### Version Control Notes

- Every commit must be DCO signed off (`git commit -s`); the "DCO" status check is required.

## Build And Test

```bash
xcodegen generate

xcodebuild build -project KeeForge.xcodeproj -scheme KeeForge \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17 Pro'

xcodebuild test -project KeeForge.xcodeproj -scheme KeeForge \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17 Pro' \
  -only-testing:KeeForgeTests/DatabaseViewModelTests -quiet

xcodebuild test -project KeeForge.xcodeproj -scheme KeeForgeMac \
  -destination 'platform=macOS' \
  -only-testing:KeeForgeMacTests/DatabaseViewModelTests -quiet
```

- Always prefer the smallest relevant test slice.
- Always use `-only-testing:`.
- Do not run the full UI suite unless explicitly asked.
- `KeeForgeMacTests` compiles the `KeeForgeTests` folder; there is no `KeeForgeMacTests` directory.
- The RC workflow (`.github/workflows/ios18-rc-tests.yml`) tests on an iOS 18 iPhone SE (3rd generation) simulator — reproduce RC failures there.

## Security Reminders

- Secrets are re-encrypted in memory with a per-session `SymmetricKey`; lock clears the session key and invalidates `EncryptedValue` access.
- Composite keys live in Keychain, not raw master passwords.
- Local saves compare the open-time SHA-512 before overwrite, create timestamped backups, and refresh the shared cached copy for AutoFill.
- App Group and security-scoped bookmark behavior affect both the app and AutoFill extension.
- Network egress stays limited to cloud sync, opt-in favicon fetching (DuckDuckGo, `icons.duckduckgo.com`), and the user-initiated feedback form (`feedback.keeforge.com`).
