# CLAUDE.md

Operating notes for Claude Code working in this repo. The user-facing pitch, install, layout, and build instructions live in [`README.md`](./README.md). This file is the *how* — rules, conventions, and recipes specific to changing the codebase.

## Naming — don't "fix" these

The display name is **FerrisScope** (mixed case). Everything technical stays lowercase: crates (`ferrisscope-core`, `ferrisscope-kube-ext`, `ferrisscope-agent`, `ferrisscope-app`), the binary `ferrisscope`, the Tauri identifier `dev.ferrisscope.desktop` (Tauri 2 warns against an `.app` suffix on macOS), disk paths under `~/.config/ferrisscope/`, and the SSA field manager constant `"ferrisscope"` (`fetch::FIELD_MANAGER`).

The `core` crate must stay Tauri-free so a future TUI / CLI can reuse the engine. If you're adding `tauri` to `core/Cargo.toml`, stop and reconsider.

## Hard architectural rules

- **One reflector per `(cluster, resource_kind)`.** Never start a second watch for data already cached.
- **Reflectors are lazy** — started on first subscribe, torn down a few seconds after the last unsubscribe.
- **Frontend is a mirror, not a source of truth.** All canonical state lives in Rust.
- **A "cluster" owns a task supervisor.** Disconnecting aborts the supervisor — no orphaned tasks, no leaked sockets.
- **Frontend business logic budget is near zero.** View state in Zustand; everything else over Tauri commands.

## Think it through before shipping

When asked to build, fix, or improve something, actively look for ways it can break before reporting done. Don't stop at "the happy path compiles."

- **Walk the failure modes.** Empty / missing / malformed input. Concurrency and cancellation. Who frees the resource. 403/404/409/410 from the apiserver. Long names, missing namespace, disconnected cluster, stale reflector.
- **Fix root causes, not symptoms.** For bugs, ask *why* the bad state became reachable before patching where it surfaced. Add a regression test.
- **Finish the loop.** Loading, empty, error, and stale states are part of the feature — a button with no disabled state during in-flight work is unfinished.
- **Surface what you didn't cover.** Wrong assumptions, untested UI paths, related bugs you spotted — name them in the response rather than implying success.

Scale the paranoia to blast radius: more for `fetch.rs` / agent loop, less for a chip-color tweak.

## Conventions

- **Rust.** `rustfmt` defaults, `clippy::pedantic` opt-in per crate. Errors via `thiserror` in libraries, `anyhow` in the binary. No `unwrap()` outside tests. Tracing via `tracing` + `tracing-subscriber`, never `println!`.
- **TypeScript.** `strict: true`, no `any`. Tauri command bindings via the typed wrapper in `ui/src/api.ts` — never call `invoke()` with stringly-typed names from components.
- **Commits.** Conventional commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `chore:`, `docs:`). Small and reviewable.
- **Task completion check.** Any task touching Rust → `cargo fmt --all -- --check` before reporting done. CI fails on drift.
- **Tests.** Backend: unit tests next to code, integration tests in `tests/` against a `kind` cluster (gated behind the `integration` feature). Frontend: Vitest for utilities; Playwright is reserved for once the UI stabilises.
- **Every new functionality must ship with tests.** No exceptions, including bug fixes (regression test) and small refactors that change behaviour. New Rust function / module → `#[cfg(test)]` next to it; new Tauri command → command-shape test in `ui/src/api.test.ts` plus the relevant backend integration test; new store reducer → reducer test in `ui/src/store.test.ts`; new component or atom → render + interaction test next to it (`*.test.tsx`); new pure utility under `ui/src/lib/` → unit test next to it. PRs without tests are incomplete — push back rather than land code that drops coverage. The only acceptable exception is purely visual tweaks (colour, spacing) where there is genuinely nothing to assert beyond what the snapshot would already show, and even then prefer a render test that pins the structural class names / aria attributes.

## Design system

The visual + interaction reference for the **Default theme** lives in [`./design/Helmsman v2/`](./design) (`hv2-rail.jsx`, `hv2-dock.jsx`, `hv2-settings.jsx`, `hv2-ui.jsx`, plus `Helmsman v2.html` for previews). It's the source of truth for layout, spacing, colors, motion, and component anatomy for that theme.

Other themes (Lens, VS Code, Readable) are intentional siblings without matching `hv2-*.jsx` artifacts. They diverge on typography, sizing, chrome, and palette by design. Don't try to "harmonize" them back into Helmsman.

- **Read before you build (Default).** Open the matching `hv2-*.jsx` before changing any UI surface in the Default theme (rail, dock, modal, table, palette, settings, fleet card, status pill, container dot…). Don't reinvent.
- **Don't edit `design/`.** Reference artifact, not application code. Push divergences back into the relevant atom in `ui/src/components/ui/`.
- **Tokens flow one direction: design → `ui/src/theme.ts`.** No hardcoded hex values or pixel paddings inline. New token? Add it to `theme.ts` first and reference *that*. Typography sizes go through the scale steps (`xs/sm/md/lg/xl`), not new literals.
- **Status semantics are fixed.** Buckets (`good` / `warn` / `bad` / `info` / `unknown`) and the transient set (Running / Pending / Terminating / Init / ContainerCreating) are defined once in `theme.ts`. Don't introduce parallel logic; extend the helpers.
- **Reuse atoms.** Container dots, status pills, gauges, loading/empty states have canonical shapes — reuse the existing atoms in `ui/src/components/ui/`.
- **When design and reality conflict** (e.g. very long context names), adapt the layout principle (tile/flex/grid) and push the change back into the atom so every surface benefits.

## Theme system

`ui/src/theme.ts` is the single source of truth for tokens, typography, sizing, and per-theme display options. A "theme" is the whole bundle; a "palette" is the color set within it.

- **Themes shipped**: `default` (Helmsman v2, canonical), `lens`, `vscode`, `readable`. Each ships with at least one palette plus its own `Typography`, `Sizing`, and `Display` defaults.
- **Resolver**: `resolveTheme({ themeId, paletteId, mode, overrides }) → ResolvedTheme`. Components read it via `useResolvedTheme()` in `store.ts`. The legacy `tokens(mode)` helper still returns the Default theme's palette and stays in place for the migration tail — new code prefers `useResolvedTheme()`.
- **CSS custom properties.** `App.tsx` publishes the active theme as `:root` custom props on every render: `--fs-font-sans`, `--fs-font-mono`, `--fs-fs-{xs,sm,md,lg,xl}`, `--fs-radius-{sm,md,lg}`, `--fs-control-h`, `--fs-border-w`. Components read them via `var(--fs-fs-md, 12.5px)` so anything not yet swept still works via the literal fallback.
- **Atom convention** (`ui/src/components/ui/atoms.tsx`): module-level constants `FS_XS / FS_SM / FS_MD / FS_LG / FS_XL` and `FF_MONO` wrap the CSS vars + fallbacks. Use those instead of inline `fontSize: 12` / `fontFamily: FONT_MONO`. Same pattern in `ResourceTable.tsx` for the hot cell styles (`TABLE_FS_CELL`, `TABLE_FONT_MONO`) — kept module-level so React's referential-equality short-circuit still applies.
- **Density + monoTables are theme-seeded, user-overrideable.** `setTheme(themeId)` writes the new theme's `display.densityDefault` and `display.monoTablesDefault` into `settings`; the Settings → Appearance toggles still win afterward.
- **UI Scale stacks on top.** `theme.typography.base` is the baseline; the UI Scale slider continues to apply via `document.documentElement.style.zoom` on top of that.
- **Adding a theme** is rare (Lens / VS Code / Readable already cover the spread). When it happens: add a `Theme` literal to `THEMES` in `theme.ts` and a swatch in the Settings picker. No backend changes — `prefs.theme.id` is a plain string and unknown ids fall back to Default at resolve time.
- **Don't rename a shipped theme id.** Persisted prefs reference ids verbatim. If you must, add a migration in `crates/core/src/prefs.rs::parse()` (the legacy bare-string-theme handling via `ThemePrefsWire` is the precedent).

## Icons

Glyph set lives in `ui/src/components/ui/icons.tsx` (`Icons` for utility, `KindIcons` keyed by Kubernetes kind). All drawn in the same solid-filled, geometric style: 24×24 viewBox, `fill="currentColor"`, no strokes.

- **Read [`design/icon.md`](./design/icon.md) before adding or modifying any icon.** Solid filled shapes, flat, monochrome, strong silhouette. No strokes, no gradients, no decorative detail.
- **Reuse the `filled(size, content)` helper.** Don't hand-roll a new `<svg>` wrapper.
- **One glyph per Kubernetes kind** in `KindIcons`, keyed by the exact `kind` string (`"Pod"`, `"ConfigMap"`, …). Unknown kinds (CRDs) fall back to the category icon — that's intentional, don't paper over it.
- **Don't inline SVGs in components.** Add to `Icons` / `KindIcons` first.

## Detail-panel primitives

Every kind's detail panel composes the same kind-agnostic primitives in `ui/src/components/detail/`. **Do not inline equivalents** — extend the primitives.

### Layout primitives (`ui/src/components/detail/primitives.tsx`)

| Primitive | Use for |
|---|---|
| `<DetailRow t label>` | Label/value row, fixed 180px label, value-side flex-wraps. The atomic building block — every named field. |
| `<SubGrid t entries\|groups copyKeyJoin>` | Indented sub-rows under a parent `DetailRow`. `groups` for multi-section (Resources → Requests + Limits); `entries` for flat lists (env vars, mounts, last-state fields). |
| `<Copyable text>` | Click-to-copy wrapper with `.fs-copy-flash` pulse. Every value the operator might want to grab. |
| `<LinkValue t onClick copyText enabled>` | Cross-kind navigation. Click → opens that object's detail; ⌘/Ctrl-click → copies. Owner refs, node names, service-account refs, image-pull-secret refs, volume sources. |
| `<ChipWrap>` | Flex-wrap container for chips. |
| `<KeyValueChips t pairs>` | Renders `[string, string][]` as `Copyable<Chip>` "k=v" chips. Labels, node selectors, annotation displays. |
| `<ChipStrip t items mono>` | Small chips with `tone: "default" \| "warn" \| "bad"` and optional per-chip `copy`. Boolean flags (privileged, hostNetwork, capabilities). |
| `<ConditionChip t cond invert>` | True/False/Unknown coloured chip. `invert` for "True is bad" conditions (NodeMemoryPressure, NodeDiskPressure). |
| `<Mute t>` | Small dim text — placeholders ("—"), captions. |

### Behaviour helpers

- `useCopyFlash<T>()` — `[ref, flash]`. Apply `ref` to any element; `flash()` re-triggers `.fs-copy-flash`. For copy ack on a custom element rather than `Copyable`.
- `ageFromIso(iso)` — relative duration ("3m", "5h", "2d"). Returns "—" on parse failure.
- `DetailNavigate` — `(kindName, namespace, name) => void`, plumbed by the parent (`DetailPanel` → `ResourceTable`). Each summary takes it as an optional prop and forwards to `LinkValue`.

### How to add a kind's detail (recipe)

1. **Backend.** `crates/kube-ext/src/kinds/<kind>.rs` — add `pub fn project_detail(<K>: &K) -> serde_json::Value` next to the existing row `project()`. Keep on-demand — don't stuff into the row payload (those go over the bus on every update).
2. **Backend.** `crates/kube-ext/src/fetch.rs` — `pub async fn get_<kind>_detail(client, namespace, name) -> Result<Value, FetchError>`; re-export from `lib.rs`.
3. **Backend.** `crates/app/src/commands.rs` — Tauri command `get_<kind>_detail_cmd`; register in `main.rs`.
4. **Frontend.** `ui/src/types.ts` — `<Kind>Detail` + nested types. Strict, no `any`.
5. **Frontend.** `ui/src/api.ts` — `api.get<Kind>Detail(...)`.
6. **Frontend.** `<KindSummary>` (in `DetailPanel.tsx` or its own file under `components/detail/<kind>/`). Fetch on mount + on `detailVersion` bump. Compose with `<DetailRow>`, decompose nested structs with `<SubGrid>`, use `<LinkValue>` for cross-kind refs, everything else `<Copyable>`.
7. **Frontend.** Wire `<KindSummary>` into `DetailPanel.tsx`'s tab dispatch.

### Style rules

- **No inline hex.** Every colour comes from `theme.ts` tokens via the `Tokens` type.
- **No new chip / row variants.** Extend the existing primitive (add a prop) — don't fork.
- **Always `<Copyable>`.** Operators copy values constantly; missing copy support is a bug.
- **Use `<LinkValue>` for any K8s reference.** Even if the target kind isn't browseable yet, pass `enabled={!!onNavigate}` — it'll degrade to plain copy.
- **Sections via `<Section t title right>`** (from `ui/atoms.tsx`), not custom headers. The `right` slot carries counts + metadata.
- **One DetailRow per concept**, even if multi-line. `wordBreak: "break-all"` and `<SubGrid>` exist for that.

## Inline editing (Server-Side Apply)

Every **structured** editable surface goes through the **same edit kit** in `ui/src/components/detail/edit.tsx`. Don't fork — extend. Live precedents: ConfigMap / Secret / ResourceQuota / LimitRange data sections, and `MetaSection`'s Labels / Annotations rows (any kind can opt in).

> **The YAML tab is the deliberate exception.** The free-form manifest editor (`ui/src/components/detail/YamlTab.tsx`) follows the `kubectl edit` model, **not** SSA: it sends an RFC 7386 JSON merge patch via `merge_patch_resource_cmd` → `merge_patch_resource()`, computed by `lib/yamlEdit.ts::mergePatch`. This is on purpose — a partial-tree SSA apply can't express deletions (a removed key is omitted, not deleted) or empty values, which is why removals/blanks silently no-op'd under the old `diffPartial`. Merge patch emits `null` for removed keys (delete) and preserves `""` (empty string), and carries `metadata.resourceVersion` for optimistic concurrency (a stale 409 → `MergePatchResult::Stale`, surfaced as a Reload / Apply-anyway banner — there is no field-ownership "force takeover" here). **Don't "harmonize" the YAML tab back onto `apply_resource`/SSA**; the structured per-field editors keep SSA for its ownership tracking, the manifest editor keeps merge patch for honest deletes.

### Backend contract

- Patches go through `apply_resource_cmd` → `apply_resource()` in `crates/kube-ext/src/fetch.rs`.
- Field manager is the constant `"ferrisscope"` (`fetch::FIELD_MANAGER`). **Don't introduce per-kind managers** — SSA's per-field ownership tracking depends on a stable name across edits from this app.
- The frontend sends only the field tree it owns (e.g. `{ data: { ... } }`, `{ spec: { hard: { ... } } }`, `{ metadata: { labels: { ... } } }`). The helper attaches `apiVersion` / `kind` / `metadata.name` / `metadata.namespace`.
- 409s surface as `ApplyResult::Conflict { managers, fields, message }`. UI shows them in `ConflictBanner` with a "Force takeover" action that re-invokes with `force: true`. **Never default to `force: true` in client code.**
- Adding an editable kind does **not** need a new backend command — the dynamic API covers every kind in the registry. If you're writing a per-kind apply fn, you're probably trying to do something other than SSA (e.g. subresource scale) — surface that.

### Frontend kit

| Primitive | Use for |
|---|---|
| `useApply<B>({ target, initial, serialize, dirtyCount, onSaved })` | Every editable section's lifecycle hook. Owns buffer, dirty count, save state machine, conflict surface. `serialize` returns the partial-object SSA payload. `onSaved` typically bumps a refetch counter. |
| `<EditModeChrome editing dirty saving onEnter onCancel onSave rightExtra/>` | Drop-in for `<Section>`'s `right` slot. Renders pencil → Save (N) / Cancel chips. |
| `<RowDeleteButton onClick/>` | The × on every editable row. Soft-delete (toggle `deleted` in the buffer); existing rows render struck-through with Restore tooltip; new rows are removed. |
| `<EditableTextValue value onChange invalid multiline/>` | Single + multi-line input atom. Auto-promotes to `<textarea>` when the value contains `\n` or exceeds ~60 chars. `invalid` for the red outline. |
| `<AddRowButton label onClick/>` | Dashed `+ Add` button under each editable section. |
| `<ConflictBanner conflict onForce onDismiss/>` | Amber 409 surface. Renders managers + field paths + raw message; "Force takeover" re-invokes with `force: true`. |
| `<KvEditor buffer onChange duplicates validateKey .../>` + `kvBuffer*` helpers | Generic key→value editor. Use for any `Record<string, string>` (labels, annotations, ConfigMap/Secret data) instead of writing a bespoke buffer. |

### Per-kind buffer pattern

When a kind needs more than `KvEditor` (Secret has reveal state, ResourceQuota carries `used`, LimitRange has nested groups), follow `ui/src/components/detail/config/index.tsx`:

1. `<Kind>Buffer` type — stable `id` per row, `originalKey`/`originalValue` for dirty detection, `isNew` and `deleted` flags, `nextId: number` for monotonic id allocation.
2. Pure functions: `bufferFrom<Kind>(detail)`, `<kind>DirtyCount(buffer)`, `validate<Kind>Buffer(buffer)`, `serialize<Kind>Buffer(buffer)`. No React.
3. Wire into `useApply<<Kind>Buffer>`. Render rows with kit primitives. Single baseline grid (e.g. `180px | 1fr | auto | auto`) — don't stack key above value.
4. Validate at the boundary (key regex, base64 form, `parseQuantity`); surface failures as `<InlineError>` above the rows. Save stays enabled — the apiserver is the final arbiter — but the user sees the issue first.

### Refetch after save

Each editable summary holds a local `const [refetch, setRefetch] = useState(0)` and includes it in `useDetail` deps. `onSaved` bumps it; the watcher will also bump `detailVersion` shortly after — both coalesce harmlessly. Don't rely on the watcher alone; the save-confirm UX feels broken if rows don't refresh immediately.

### Opting an existing kind into label/annotation editing

Pass `editTarget={{ clusterId, kindId, namespace, name }}` and `onSaved` to `<MetaSection>`. Labels and Annotations rows pick up the pencil + KvEditor automatically. Don't pass either when the kind shouldn't be editable yet — opt in incrementally as we build confidence.

### What edits to NOT allow

- **Subresource fields** (`status.*`) — SSA against status requires a different subresource path; not currently supported.
- **Immutable-marked objects** (ConfigMap / Secret with `immutable: true`) — show `InlineWarn` and let the apiserver reject; don't pre-block client-side.
- **Anything that needs a different field manager.** If you think you do, push back to the user — diverging managers loses the ownership benefits SSA gives us.

## Well-known CRD overrides

Some CRDs (Gateway API today; Argo / Flux / Cert-Manager / Istio / Tekton later) ship as `DynamicObject` watches but deserve first-class treatment in the rail without dragging in a Rust crate per ecosystem. The overrides layer in `crates/kube-ext/src/well_known.rs` handles this. Watcher path stays generic; what changes is projection + display metadata.

### When to use

All three must hold:
- The CRD is widely deployed and operators expect to navigate it by name.
- The default 3-column projection (name / namespace / age) hides everything that matters.
- You don't want a typed Rust dep for the API group (version skew, build cost).

If not, leave it on the generic dynamic path — Custom Resources is the right home for the long tail.

### Mechanism

- **`WellKnownCrd`** — static descriptor: `short_id` (stable, frontend-visible), `group`, `kind`, `category`, plus three function pointers: `columns()`, `project(&DynamicObject) -> Value`, `project_detail(&DynamicObject) -> Value`.
- **`well_known::registry()`** — flat `&'static [WellKnownCrd]` aggregating per-ecosystem submodules.
- **`registry::ResourceKindEntry::from_dynamic_crd`** — when CRD discovery surfaces a kind, it consults `well_known::lookup_by_gk(group, kind)`. Hit → carry the override's id, category, columns, projection. Miss → fall back to the generic `crd:` path.
- **Id format:** `wkcrd:<short>|<group>|<version>|<plural>|<kind>|<scope>`. Self-contained — no per-cluster cache. `version` and `plural` come from CRD discovery so we don't hard-code (e.g.) HTTPRoute at v1 and break clusters still on v1beta1.
- **Generic detail fetch:** `fetch::get_well_known_detail(client, kind_id, ns, name)` — one Tauri command (`get_well_known_detail_cmd`) serves every override. Adding a new ecosystem doesn't add a backend command.

### How to add an ecosystem (recipe)

1. **Backend.** New `crates/kube-ext/src/well_known/<ecosystem>.rs` with `pub static OVERRIDES: &[WellKnownCrd] = &[…]`. Use the `arr_at` / `str_at` / `obj_get` / `dyn_meta_value` helpers in `well_known.rs` — projections must be total, never panic on shape drift.
2. **Backend.** `pub mod <ecosystem>;` in `well_known.rs`; concatenate its `OVERRIDES` into `well_known::registry()`.
3. **Frontend.** `<Kind>Detail` types in `ui/src/types.ts`. Strict, no `any`.
4. **Frontend.** Summary components in `ui/src/components/detail/<ecosystem>/index.tsx`. They take `kindId: string` (the full `wkcrd:` id) and call `api.getWellKnownDetail<T>(clusterId, kindId, namespace, name)` — the generic getter is already wired. Compose standard primitives.
5. **Frontend.** `DetailPanel.tsx` — add the new `short_id`s to `WELL_KNOWN_SUMMARY_SHORTS` and a `case` in the `wkShort` dispatch block. Don't touch `SUMMARY_KINDS` or the typed switch.
6. **Frontend.** Add a glyph per kind to `KindIcons`, keyed by the Kubernetes `kind` string.

### Rules

- **Never pull in a typed Rust crate for an ecosystem we override.** Walk the unstructured JSON; tolerate missing fields.
- **`short_id` must not collide** with built-in kind ids or other overrides.
- **Projections must be total.** `as_str() / as_array()` returning `None` is the norm on shape drift; project to `null` or `—`. `arr_at` returns `&[]` when missing.
- **Don't promote a CRD to a built-in category if its install footprint is rare.** Custom Resources is the right home for the long tail.
- **Version is per-cluster.** Override entries declare `(group, kind)` only — `version` and `plural` come from CRD discovery and are embedded in the runtime id. Don't hard-code a version in projection logic.

Currently overridden: Gateway API (`gateway.networking.k8s.io`) — promoted to **Network**: GatewayClass, Gateway, HTTPRoute, GRPCRoute, ReferenceGrant. See `crates/kube-ext/src/well_known/gateway_api.rs` + `ui/src/components/detail/gateway/index.tsx`.

## Agent tools (native + optional MCP)

The chat agent runs an LLM loop. Native (in-process) tools cover the full Kubernetes management surface; an external MCP server is optional and operator-configured.

1. **Native (in-process) tools** — `crates/app/src/agent_native/`, registered through the `NativeTool` trait in `crates/agent/src/native.rs`. The complete K8s toolkit lives here: pods (list/get/delete/run/exec), arbitrary GVK resources (list/get/delete/scale/apply), nodes (kubelet logs + stats summary + diagnose), namespaces, events, helm (list/get/history/install/uninstall), metrics, prometheus, port-forwards, node shells, configuration introspection, plus app-resident capabilities (supervisor inspection, terminal handoff, privileged node shells).
2. **External MCP server (optional)** — operator-configured via `mcp_binary_path` in AI settings. **Not bundled** — there is no installer or auto-detect; the binary must already exist on disk. We spawn it per chat and merge its tools with the native catalogue. Useful for non-K8s MCP servers (filesystem, github, custom) since native tools already cover Kubernetes.

Both surface as the same `ToolSchema`, hit the same `ApprovalMode` gate, and appear in the `chat_list_tools` inspector tree.

### Hard rules

- **Native is the full kubernetes toolkit.** The chat must work end-to-end against any cluster with no MCP binary configured. Don't add features that depend on a specific external MCP server being present.
- **Name native tools `fs_<area>_<verb>`.** The `fs_` prefix prevents collisions with any external MCP server's namespace. On collision MCP wins (registered first); just don't collide.
- **Each tool declares its own `category()`.** The name heuristic in `mcp::classify` is for external MCP tools we don't control. Native tools know exactly whether they read or write — return `Write` for anything that mutates cluster state, runs commands on a node, or grants the agent elevated privileges. `Unknown` is treated as Write by the approval gate.
- **Stay Tauri-free in the agent crate.** The `NativeTool` trait lives in `crates/agent/`. Concrete impls live in `crates/app/src/agent_native/` where they can hold `tauri::AppHandle`, look up `AppState`, talk to the kube `Client`. Don't push Tauri types down into the trait.
- **Per-call timeout is enforced by the loop, not by the tool.** `agent.rs` wraps every native call in `TOOL_CALL_TIMEOUT`. Tools may apply tighter internal timeouts (e.g. `fs_node_shell_exec`'s `timeout_seconds` arg).
- **Errors are values, not panics.** Return `NativeToolError::Failed(...)`; the loop turns it into `is_error: true` so the LLM can recover. Never `unwrap()` on cluster state, JSON shape, or kube responses.
- **Anything you allocate, you clean up.** External state (debug pods, port-forwards, ephemeral files, child processes) → implement `on_chat_close`. Hook fires from `chat_close` (operator close, app shutdown, *and* cluster switch — switching cluster means closing the chat and opening a new one against the new cluster). Best-effort; log failures, never propagate.
- **Belt-and-braces for cluster-resident state.** Don't rely on `on_chat_close` alone — set a server-side TTL so orphans get reaped after crashes / force-quits. Pods: `spec.activeDeadlineSeconds`. Jobs: `spec.ttlSecondsAfterFinish`. Node-shell pod uses 15 minutes (`POD_TTL_SECONDS` in `node_shell.rs`).
- **Tell the LLM about lifetime in the tool's `description`.** If a session has a TTL or auto-closes, say so explicitly so the model plans around it.

### How to add a new native tool (recipe)

1. **Decide the surface.** One tool per discrete operation. Stateful (multi-call session like `fs_node_shell_*`) → design open / exec / close as three separate tools sharing a session table.
2. **Backend.** New file under `crates/app/src/agent_native/<area>.rs`. Define a struct per tool (`AppHandle`, `cluster_id`, shared session table…). Impl `NativeTool`: `schema()` returns `{ name, description, parameters }`, `category()` returns the truth, `call(args)` does the work, `on_chat_close` releases external state.
3. **Backend.** Register in `agent_native::build_registry`. Order doesn't matter; keep related tools adjacent.
4. **Backend.** No new Tauri command — `chat_*` already routes everything. `chat_list_tools` and the merged-schemas pipeline pick up new tools automatically.
5. **Frontend.** No type changes if the wire shape stays as `ChatToolWire`.
6. **Test.** `cargo fmt --all -- --check` + `cargo check --workspace` + `cargo clippy -p ferrisscope-agent -p ferrisscope-app -- -D warnings`. Spin a chat against a `kind` cluster and verify (a) inspector visibility, (b) approval if Write, (c) result rendering, (d) cleanup on chat-close / cluster switch.

### What native tools should NOT do

- **Don't add a duplicate of an existing native tool.** Check `agent_native/` first; the K8s toolkit is comprehensive (pods, resources/GVK, nodes, namespaces, events, helm, metrics, prometheus, port-forwards, node shells, configuration). Extend an existing tool with a new arg before forking a new file.
- **Don't bypass the approval gate.** Even if "obviously safe", classify correctly and let the operator's `ApprovalMode` decide. Operators can opt into `AllowAllWrites` per chat — don't make that decision for them.
- **Don't store mutable state in the tool struct itself.** Use an `Arc<Mutex<…>>` shared across related tools (see `NodeShellSessions`). Single-tool state is fine if it's truly per-tool.
- **Don't promote a native tool to an MCP server prematurely.** If we ever need *external* MCP clients (Claude Desktop, Cursor) to use these, we can stand up an in-process MCP server — `crates/agent/src/mcp/mod.rs::McpClient` already takes any `AsyncRead`/`AsyncWrite` pair so a duplex pipe works without a second process. Future move; today, native is faster, simpler, and avoids a second framing layer.

For the current shipping inventory of native tools, the sources live in `crates/app/src/agent_native/` (one file per area) — that's the authoritative list. Per-release deltas are on the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/dzcorp/FerrisScope/releases).

## Working with kube-rs

- Prefer `kube::runtime::reflector` and `Controller` over raw `watcher` streams. They handle 410 Gone, resync, and bookmarks correctly.
- Use the dynamic API (`DynamicObject`, `ApiResource`) for CRD support. Don't hand-roll typed structs for every CRD a user might have.
- For pod exec / attach use `AttachParams` and stream over Tauri events. Backpressure matters — if the frontend can't keep up, drop, don't buffer unbounded.
- Auth plugins (gke / aws / oidc) shell out via `kube-rs` exec auth. Surface plugin failures clearly in a diagnostics panel — silent auth failures are the #1 Lens UX papercut we want to fix.

## Out of scope

See the corresponding section in [`README.md`](./README.md). Don't drift here; if a request points at one of those areas, push back and link to it.

## When in doubt

Code wins over docs. The rules above describe what the codebase enforces today; if you find a divergence, fix it in the same change rather than papering over it. For strategic questions (scope, milestones, open decisions), surface them to the user before settling them silently in code.
