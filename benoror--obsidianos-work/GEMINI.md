# Agents

This is an Obsidian vault with AI agent skills. See [USER.md](USER.md) for the vault owner's identity. Agents working in this repo should be aware of the following structure and conventions.

## Skills

Custom skills live in `.agents/skills/`. Each has a `SKILL.md` with usage, workflow, and conventions.

### Skill proxies (symlinks to `.agents/skills/`)

The canonical skill tree is **`.agents/skills/`**. These paths are symlinks to the same directory so each agent discovers the same skills:

| Path | Used by |
| --- | --- |
| [`.cursor/skills`](.cursor/skills) | Cursor |
| [`.claude/skills`](.claude/skills) | Claude Code |
| [`.opencode/skills`](.opencode/skills) | OpenCode |
| [`skills/`](skills) | OpenClaw ([workspace `skills`](https://docs.openclaw.ai/skills/)) |

OpenCode also discovers `.agents/skills/` directly; the `.opencode/skills` link matches the Cursor / Claude layout.

## Rules

Shared rules live in `.agents/rules/` and are the single source of truth. Agent-specific wrappers point to them.

| Rule | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [qmd-search](.agents/rules/qmd-search.md) | Prefer QMD over grep for vault search (always apply) |
| [skill-conventions](.agents/rules/skill-conventions.md) | Skill structure, shared conventions, project context |
| [skill-registry](.agents/rules/skill-registry.md) | Keep skill tables in sync when skills change |

### Agent wrappers

| Agent | Instruction files | How rules are loaded |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cursor | `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` | Auto-injected by glob; each `.mdc` points to `.agents/rules/` |
| Claude Code | `CLAUDE.md`, `.agents/skills/CLAUDE.md` | Read on startup; point to `.agents/rules/` |
| OpenCode / Crush | `OpenCode.md` | Read on startup; points to `.agents/rules/` |
| OpenClaw | `AGENTS.md` (and your gateway config) | Rules live in `.agents/rules/`; skills via repo `skills/` → `.agents/skills/` |

## Vault Layout

```
Meetings/              Meeting notes by subfolder (PAM/, TBs/, Eng/, etc.)
Templates/             Obsidian templates
Teams/People/          Person files: @Name.md
Teams/                 Team files: +TeamName.md
ToDo's.md              Aggregated Tasks plugin view
Tracker.md             Project tracker
```

## Conventions

- **User**: See [USER.md](USER.md) for identity, timezone, aliases, and agent behavior rules.
- **Frontmatter**: YAML between `---` fences. `modified:` is managed by Obsidian — never set manually.
- **Participants**: `[[@Name]]` wikilinks (people) or `[[+Team]]` (teams).
- **AI Transcripts**: Cached under `## 🤖 AI Notes` with provider subheadings and collapsible callouts (`[!gemini_notes]-`, `[!gemini_todos]-`, `[!gemini_transcript]-`).
- **Tasks priorities**: 🔺 highest, ⏫ high, 🔼 medium, 🔽 low.

## MCP & external tools

- **QMD** — Configured in [.cursor/mcp.json](.cursor/mcp.json) for vault search (MCP server `npx qmd mcp`).
- **Google Workspace** — Use the **`gws` CLI** ([Google Workspace CLI](https://github.com/googleworkspace/cli)) for Docs, Drive, Calendar, and Gmail in read-only workflows. See [README.md](README.md) § Google Workspace CLI and [.agents/skills/_shared/google-workspace-cli.md](.agents/skills/_shared/google-workspace-cli.md).

## Syncing from Upstream

If you forked or cloned this repo into a private vault, you can pull structural updates (skills, rules, shared conventions) without overwriting your personal data.

```bash
./.scripts/sync-upstream.sh              # fetch + merge
./.scripts/sync-upstream.sh --preview    # see what's new without merging
```

First-time setup:

```bash
git remote add upstream <url-to-this-repo>
./.scripts/sync-upstream.sh              # auto-configures merge driver on first run
```

Protected paths (always keep local version during merge): `USER.md`, `Tracker.md`, `.env`, `.cursor/mcp.json`, `Meetings/`, `Teams/`, `Templates/`, `Recaps/`. Edit `.gitattributes` to add or remove paths.
