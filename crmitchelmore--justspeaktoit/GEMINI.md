# Repository Guidelines

## Versioning & Release Process

This project maintains **separate version tracks** for macOS and iOS:

### Version Discovery

**CRITICAL: Always check the ACTUAL latest release before creating a new version.**

```bash
# Find the latest macOS release version:
gh release list --repo crmitchelmore/justspeaktoit | grep "mac-v" | head -1

# Or check GitHub releases page for mac-v* tags
# Example: if latest is mac-v0.9.1 → next should be mac-v0.9.2

# The VERSION file is NOT authoritative for releases - always check GitHub tags
```

### Tag Conventions

| Platform | Tag Format | Example | Workflow Triggered |
|----------|------------|---------|-------------------|
| macOS | `mac-v*` | `mac-v0.7.7` | `.github/workflows/release-mac.yml` |
| iOS | `ios-v*` | `ios-v0.9.1` | `.github/workflows/release-ios.yml` (manual) |
| Legacy | `v*` | `v0.7.5` | None (deprecated) |

### macOS Release Process

Releases are **fully automated** via conventional commits:

1. Push to `main` with a releasable commit type (`feat:`, `fix:`, `perf:`, or breaking change)
2. `auto-release.yml` determines the version bump and creates a `mac-v*` tag
3. `release-mac.yml` builds, notarises, publishes to GitHub Releases, updates appcast.xml, and updates Homebrew tap

Manual releases are still possible by creating and pushing a `mac-v*` tag directly.

### iOS Release Process

1. iOS uses **manual workflow dispatch** (not tag-triggered)
2. Go to Actions → "Release iOS (TestFlight)" → Run workflow
3. Enter version number (check App Store Connect for current version)

### VERSION File

The `VERSION` file is a **hint** used as fallback when no tag is present. It does NOT control the release version - the **tag determines the version**. Keep it updated but always verify against actual releases.

### Post-Release Support

When a user reports that a freshly shipped macOS release won't install or launch, perform the remediation directly when the environment permits filesystem/app actions; otherwise provide these exact steps for the user to run locally:
1. Download the latest `mac-v*` DMG.
2. Back up the existing app to a persistent location, e.g. `mv /Applications/JustSpeakToIt.app ~/Desktop/JustSpeakToIt.app.bak-$(date +%s)`.
3. Replace `/Applications/JustSpeakToIt.app` with the app from the DMG.
4. Verify launch locally (e.g. `open -n /Applications/JustSpeakToIt.app`) before asking the user to retry.
5. If local install verification is requested, confirm `/Applications/JustSpeakToIt.app` exists, read `CFBundleShortVersionString`, and verify the process is running.

## Project Structure & Module Organization

This project uses **Swift Package Manager** for modularization with cross-platform support:

```
Package.swift           # Defines all targets and dependencies
Sources/
├── SpeakCore/          # Shared cross-platform library (types, protocols, keychain)
├── SpeakApp/           # macOS application (executable)
└── SpeakiOS/           # iOS library (views, services, with #if os(iOS) guards)
SpeakiOSApp/            # iOS app entry point (@main)
Project.swift           # Tuist manifest (Xcode project generation)
Workspace.swift         # Tuist workspace manifest
Just Speak to It.xcodeproj/ # Generated Xcode project
Tests/                  # XCTest suite
```

### Swift Package Targets

| Target | Type | Platform | Description |
|--------|------|----------|-------------|
| `SpeakCore` | Library | macOS + iOS | Cross-platform types, protocols, secure storage |
| `SpeakApp` | Executable | macOS | macOS SwiftUI application |
| `SpeakiOSLib` | Library | iOS | iOS views and services (exported with `public` APIs) |

### Modularization Patterns

1. **Shared code in SpeakCore**: Types, protocols, and utilities that work on both platforms
2. **Platform guards**: Use `#if os(iOS)` / `#if os(macOS)` for platform-specific code
3. **Public APIs for libraries**: Types in `SpeakiOSLib` must be `public` for Xcode project to access
4. **Tuist links packages**: `Project.swift` references the local Swift package for Xcode generation

### iOS App Structure

The iOS app is built via Xcode but sources come from Swift packages:
- `SpeakiOSApp/SpeakiOSApp.swift` - Entry point with `@main`
- Links `SpeakCore` and `SpeakiOSLib` as package dependencies
- Run `tuist generate` and open `"Just Speak to It.xcworkspace"` in Xcode to build/run on device

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

### macOS (SwiftPM)
- `make` or `make run` – Build and launch the macOS app
- `make build` – Debug compilation only
- `make rebuild` – Clean and rebuild from scratch
- `make test` – Execute XCTest suite
- `swift build --target SpeakiOSLib` – Verify iOS library compiles

### iOS (Xcode)
- `tuist generate` – Generate the Xcode workspace
- `open "Just Speak to It.xcworkspace"` – Open in Xcode
- Select device/simulator and build (Cmd+B)
- Or use xcodebuild MCP for automation (see below)

### Linting
```bash
swift package plugin --allow-writing-to-package-directory swiftlint --strict --target SpeakApp
swift package plugin --allow-writing-to-package-directory swiftformat --target SpeakApp
```
- CI SwiftLint also runs with `.swiftlint-baseline.json`; the baseline is line-number-sensitive, so prefer exact-line inline suppressions when unblocking lint to avoid baseline drift.

## MCP Tools

### xcodebuild MCP
Installed globally via npm for Xcode build automation:
```bash
npm install -g xcodebuildmcp
```

The MCP server provides tools for:
- Project/workspace discovery
- Building for iOS/macOS targets
- Simulator management
- App deployment and testing

### Usage Pattern
When xcodebuild MCP is available, prefer it for:
- Automated iOS builds without opening Xcode
- CI/CD pipeline integration
- Simulator lifecycle management

## Design Patterns

### Liquid Glass (iOS 26+)
See `.copilot/skills/liquid-glass.md` for Apple's Liquid Glass design guidance.

Key principles:
- **Glass for controls layer** (toolbars, nav bars, floating controls) - not content
- **System components first** - they apply Liquid Glass automatically
- **Remove custom backgrounds** on navigation chrome
- **SF Symbols** for icon-only controls with accessibility labels
- **Spring animations** for natural motion
- **Tint sparingly** - only for semantic emphasis (critical actions)

### Cross-Platform Code
```swift
// In SpeakCore (shared)
public struct TranscriptionResult: Sendable { ... }

// In SpeakiOS (iOS-only)
#if os(iOS)
public final class iOSLiveTranscriber: ObservableObject { ... }
#endif
```

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Swift files use 4-space indentation and LF line endings (configured via `.swiftformat`)
- Prefer expressive type names (`ContentView`, `SpeakApp`)
- Keep new API surface `internal` unless exposure is required for cross-module use
- Use `public` for types that need to be accessed from Xcode project or other modules
- Enforce linting via `.swiftlint.yml`; rules include `explicit_self`, `implicit_return`, line-length 120/160

## Testing Guidelines
- Tests live under `Tests/SpeakAppTests` and rely on XCTest
- Name specs `test<Behaviour>_<Expectation>()` to mirror scenarios
- Run `make test` locally before PRs
- iOS testing requires device/simulator via Xcode

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- **Never use `git add -A` or `git add .`** — always stage specific files (`git add <path>`) to avoid committing other agents' work
- **Use Conventional Commits** — this is mandatory as commit types drive automated releases
- Commit types that **trigger a release**: `feat:` (minor bump), `fix:` / `perf:` (patch bump), breaking changes via `!` suffix or `BREAKING CHANGE` footer (major bump)
- Commit types that **do not release**: `chore:`, `docs:`, `ci:`, `style:`, `test:`, `refactor:`, `build:`
- Keep commits scoped to a single concern
- Use platform tags in scope: `feat(mac):`, `fix(ios):` — these feed Sparkle release notes
- Pull requests should describe motivation, note user-visible changes, and reference related issues
- Include `make test` output or screenshots when UI shifts
- Direct pushes to `main` are blocked by branch protection; create a branch and PR even for small fixes, then merge through the normal repo gate.

### Automated Release Process
- Every push to `main` triggers `.github/workflows/auto-release.yml`
- The workflow analyses conventional commits since the last `mac-v*` tag
- If releasable commits exist, it creates a new `mac-v*` tag which triggers the full macOS build/notarise/release pipeline
- The `VERSION` file is updated as a best-effort side effect; the **tag is the source of truth**
- Non-releasable commits (chore, docs, ci, etc.) do not create a release

### Working with Auto-Release
- After pushing a releasable commit (`feat:`, `fix:`, `perf:`), the bot pushes a VERSION bump commit to main
- Scope does not affect macOS auto-release: `feat(ios):`, `fix(ios):`, and `perf(ios):` on `main` still create a new `mac-v*` tag because `.github/workflows/auto-release.yml` matches commit type, not scope.
- You must `git pull --rebase origin main` before your next push, or it will be rejected
- If you have unstaged changes: `git stash && git pull --rebase origin main && git stash pop`

### PR merge unblock checklist
- If `gh pr merge` says “required status checks are expected” while checks look green, inspect `mergeStateStatus`; if `BEHIND`, rebase on `origin/main` and force-push with lease.
- After each push, re-check unresolved review threads (especially CodeRabbit), as new threads can be created on updated diffs and still block merge.
- If admin merge fails with `All comments must be resolved.`, resolve the remaining review threads before retrying.

## SwiftUI Concurrency Patterns

### Singleton ObservableObjects
- Use `@ObservedObject` (not `@StateObject`) when referencing singletons like `TipStore.shared`
- Singletons manage their own lifecycle; `@StateObject` causes ownership conflicts and crashes

### Child View Button Actions
- Don't pass `@ObservedObject` to child views that have button actions
- Pass primitive values (e.g., `isPurchasing: Bool`) and access singleton directly in action:
  ```swift
  Button {
      Task { @MainActor in
          await MySingleton.shared.doWork()
      }
  }
  ```

### Async Delays in SwiftUI
- Prefer `.task { try? await Task.sleep(for: .seconds(2)) }` over `DispatchQueue.asyncAfter`
- The `.task` modifier properly handles view lifecycle and cancellation

### MainActor Deadlock Anti-Pattern
- **Never** use `DispatchSemaphore.wait()` on the MainActor while spawning `Task { @MainActor in }` — this is an instant deadlock
- The semaphore blocks the MainActor, preventing the task from ever executing to signal it
- Use `Thread.sleep` for brief synchronous delays, or restructure as fully `async`

### NotificationCenter Block-Based Observers
- `addObserver(forName:object:queue:block:)` returns an opaque `NSObjectProtocol` token — **always store it**
- Remove with `NotificationCenter.default.removeObserver(token)`, NOT `removeObserver(self, name:, object:)`
- The `removeObserver(self, name:, object:)` variant is for target-action observers only
- Failing to store and remove the token causes a memory leak on each registration cycle

### Audio Engine Resource Cleanup
- When adding guard-let error paths in transcription code, always clean up audio resources started before the guard point
- Call `audioEngine.stop()` and `audioEngine.inputNode.removeTap(onBus: 0)` before throwing
- Compare with existing cleanup paths in the same function to ensure consistency

## AssemblyAI Universal Streaming

### Turn message semantics
- With `format_turns=true`, each turn produces TWO end-of-turn messages: unformatted then formatted. Only commit the formatted one.
- `transcript` contains only finalised words (`word_is_final=true`). Non-final words appear only in the `words` array.
- Track `turn_order` to replace (not append) segments for the same turn.
- Interim text uses replacement semantics — AssemblyAI sends the full turn text each time, not deltas.

### Pre-processing prompt
- AssemblyAI streaming v3 does **not** support an arbitrary `prompt` parameter — only `keyterms_prompt`.
- `keyterms_prompt` entries are sourced from `assemblyAIKeyterms` (comma-separated, max 50 chars each, max 100 items).
- The `postProcessingSystemPrompt` is applied post-transcription by `PostProcessingManager`, not by the streaming API.
- When a pre-processing prompt is active, LLM post-processing is automatically skipped.

### Rollout preference
- Prefer core live-transcription integration first; add advanced v3 controls only when a clear app need is confirmed.
- Keep style control in post-processing (`postProcessingSystemPrompt`); streaming v3 supports `keyterms_prompt` only.

### Connection reliability
- Use EU host first (`streaming.eu.assemblyai.com`) and retry once on global host (`streaming.assemblyai.com`) only when failure occurs before `Begin`.
- Guard shared live-stream state (`webSocketTask`, `isStopping`, callbacks, `sessionDidBegin`) with synchronisation when accessed from receive/send completions and lifecycle methods.
- During delayed stop cleanup, clear `webSocketTask` only when it is the same task instance being terminated (`===`) to avoid wiping a newly-started session.
- Do not establish fallback/reconnect sockets after stopping has begun.
- On failure cleanup, capture the active session before async cancellation so failed runs still persist to History.

### Live audio framing + shutdown guarantees
- Live PCM chunk duration must be 50-1000ms (100ms preferred); sub-50ms frames can trigger close code 3007 (`Input Duration Violation`).
- Stop sequencing must be: flush pending PCM, await pending WebSocket send completions (bounded timeout), send `ForceEndpoint`, then `Terminate`.
- If users report “batch-like” live behaviour (no live text), run a direct WebSocket probe first and capture close code/reason before changing app logic.

### Key files
- `AssemblyAITranscriptionProvider.swift` — WebSocket client, response models
- `TranscriptionManager.swift` (`AssemblyAILiveController`) — turn handling, audio processing

## Accessibility Text Insertion

### API semantics
- `kAXSelectedTextAttribute` — inserts at cursor position (or replaces selection). Preferred default.
- `kAXValueAttribute` — replaces the entire field content. Use as fallback.
- Not all apps support `kAXSelectedTextAttribute`; fall back gracefully.
- `SmartTextOutput` skips accessibility entirely for known problematic apps (Electron, Chromium, etc.).
- Do not probe the focused AX element synchronously at recording start; check permission only, then defer AX readiness checks until the first insertion attempt.

### Settings
- `AccessibilityInsertionMode`: `.insertAtCursor` (default) or `.replaceAll`
- Only relevant when `TextOutputMethod` is `.smart` or `.accessibilityOnly`

## OpenClaw Hands-Free Voice Mode (iOS)

### Conversation loop
- Keep Conversation Mode user-configurable and available directly on the OpenClaw chat screen.
- In Conversation Mode, use the loop: record → send → speak → auto-resume listening.
- Auto-resume must remain configurable so users can opt out.

### Acknowledge controls
- Support multiple acknowledgement paths: on-screen tap, headset single-tap (remote command), and optional keyword.
- Treat acknowledgement keywords as control input and trim them from transcript text before sending.

### Latency rules
- Avoid fixed sleeps for connection readiness; wait for connection state with timeout and explicit error.
- Provide a low-latency speech option that skips summarisation before TTS when enabled.

### iOS control ergonomics
- Prefer native iOS controls (for example, `Toggle` with switch style) over custom checkbox-like controls in chat/input surfaces.
- Keep interactive controls at least 44pt high/wide, and size message composer inputs to a comfortable HIG-aligned minimum (around 50pt).
- If acknowledgement hints are shown, make the interaction target explicit (for example, “Tap the chat area…”).

## Commit Message Tagging
- Prefix commit messages with a platform tag or scope: `[mac]`/`[ios]` or `(mac)`/`(ios)` (e.g., `fix: [mac] add recording sound picker` or `fix(mac): add recording sound picker`).
- These tags/scopes feed the Sparkle release notes generator so macOS updates only list mac-specific changes.

## Security & Configuration Tips
- Do not commit personalised signing assets
- Keep bundle identifiers within `Config/AppInfo.plist` and adjust via scripts
- API keys stored in Keychain via `SecureStorage` (SpeakCore) / `SecureAppStorage` (SpeakApp)
- Keychain service: `com.github.speakapp.credentials`, account: `speak-app-secrets`

## App Store Connect / iOS Signing (sensitive)
- App Store Connect API Key ID: stored in secure notes (do not commit)
- App Store Connect Issuer ID: stored in secure notes (do not commit)
- App Store Connect API key: store base64 in `.env` as `APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY` (do not commit)
- iOS distribution cert: store base64 in `.env` as `IOS_DISTRIBUTION_P12` (password in `.env` as `IOS_DISTRIBUTION_PASSWORD`)
- GitHub secrets used by CI: `APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY`, `APP_STORE_CONNECT_ISSUER_ID`, `APPLE_TEAM_ID`, `IOS_DISTRIBUTION_P12`, `IOS_DISTRIBUTION_PASSWORD`, `IOS_APPSTORE_PROFILE`, `IOS_WIDGET_APPSTORE_PROFILE`
- Required entitlements: App Group `group.com.justspeaktoit.ios` and iCloud container `iCloud.com.justspeaktoit.ios`
- Never commit private keys or provisioning profile contents.

## Sentry Error Monitoring
- **Region:** EU (de.sentry.io) — use `https://de.sentry.io/api/0/` for all API calls
- **Org slug:** `tally-lz`
- **Project slug:** `justspeaktoit`
- **Auth token:** stored in `.env` as `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` (do not commit)
- **DSN:** configured in `Sources/SpeakApp/SentryManager.swift`
- **GitHub CI secret:** `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN`, `SENTRY_ORG`, `SENTRY_PROJECT`

### Querying Sentry from CLI
```bash
# Load token from .env
export SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN="$(sed -n 's/^SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=//p' .env | tail -n1)"
export SENTRY_ORG="tally-lz"
export SENTRY_PROJECT="justspeaktoit"

# List unresolved issues
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN" \
  "https://de.sentry.io/api/0/projects/$SENTRY_ORG/$SENTRY_PROJECT/issues/?query=is:unresolved&sort=date&limit=25"

# Get latest event for an issue
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN" \
  "https://de.sentry.io/api/0/organizations/$SENTRY_ORG/issues/{ISSUE_ID}/events/latest/"

# Ignore/resolve an issue
curl -s -X PUT -H "Authorization: Bearer $SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"status":"ignored"}' \
  "https://de.sentry.io/api/0/organizations/$SENTRY_ORG/issues/{ISSUE_ID}/"
```

## Beads Issue Tracker

This project uses **bd (beads)** for issue tracking. Run `bd prime` to see full workflow context and commands.

### Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready              # Find available work
bd show <id>          # View issue details
bd update <id> --claim  # Claim work
bd close <id>         # Complete work
```

### Rules

- Use `bd` for ALL task tracking -- do NOT use TodoWrite, TaskCreate, or markdown TODO lists
- Run `bd prime` for detailed command reference and session close protocol
- Use `bd remember` for persistent knowledge -- do NOT use MEMORY.md files
- Keep Beads automation on Copilot CLI surfaces (`AGENTS.md` and repo-local `.github/hooks/*.json`); do NOT add Claude-specific Beads files such as `CLAUDE.md` or `.claude/settings.json`

## Session Completion

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   bd dolt push
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds
