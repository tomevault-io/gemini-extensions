## igv-reports-skill

> Use when the user wants an HTML, clickable, browseable, offline, or emailable viewer of genomic data — phrases like "HTML IGV report", "offline IGV", "self-contained HTML", "clickable viewer", "create_report", "igv-reports", "email this viewer", or any browseable HTML of reads at variants, fusion breakpoints, SV junctions, viral integrations, ChIP peaks, ROIs, or ONT 5mC/5hmC methylation views at promoters/gene bodies/DMRs. Trigger even when the user doesn't say "igv-reports" — giveaway is HTML/clickable/offline plus genomic regions. Also fire on /igv-reports. DO NOT use for static PNG/PDF/SVG IGV screenshots — use the igv-screenshots skill instead.


# igv-reports

This skill builds **self-contained HTML genomic-region reports** with
[igv-reports](https://github.com/igvteam/igv-reports) (`create_report`).
Each report is a single browseable HTML containing the igv.js viewer plus
embedded data slices for every region. No server, no internet, no IGV
install needed at view time.

The skill has three entry points:
- **build** — one-shot: sites BED + BAM(s) ± VCF → HTML.
- **cohort** — multi-sample driver from a samplesheet → per-sample HTMLs + index.
- **prep-track** — utility: convert plain-gzip GFF/GTF/BED.gz into a
  bgzip + tabix-indexed track that igv-reports can load.

## What this skill is (and is not)

This skill is a **driver layer** on top of the upstream `igv-reports`
Python package by the IGV team
([github.com/igvteam/igv-reports](https://github.com/igvteam/igv-reports)).
The naming is unavoidable — both share the `igv-reports` name.

| Component | Source | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `create_report` CLI | upstream PyPI package `igv-reports` | does the actual HTML rendering |
| `scripts/build_igvreports.py` | **this skill** | wraps `create_report` with default-track resolution, cohort/samplesheet mode, SIF auto-detect |
| `scripts/verify_{report,cohort,anchors}.py` | **this skill** | post-render structural + content audits (not in upstream) |
| `scripts/prep_track.sh` | **this skill** | bgzip+tabix utility for annotation tracks |

The skill is not on PyPI — it's a directory of scripts. Use it by either
cloning this repo or copying `scripts/` next to your data.

## Off-MSKCC quickstart

Defaults assume MSKCC HPC (lab SIF, `databases_config.yaml`, `/data1/greenbab`
bind). Anywhere else:

```bash
# 1. Install the UPSTREAM igv-reports package (provides `create_report`).
#    Use -U to pick up the latest fixes; skill requires >=1.16.0.
pip install -U 'igv-reports>=1.16.0'

# 2. Get this skill's wrapper scripts (one of):
#    - clone:  git clone https://github.com/sahuno/igv-reports-skill.git
#              cd igv-reports-skill
#    - or copy scripts/ next to your project

# 3. Run the wrapper, bypassing the lab databases YAML with explicit paths:
python scripts/build_igvreports.py \
    --genome hg38 \
    --sites sites.hg38.bed \
    --bam tumor.bam normal.bam \
    --fasta /path/to/hg38.fa \
    --no-default-tracks \
    --extra-track /path/to/your_cpg_islands.bed.gz \
    --extra-track /path/to/gencode.v47.annotation.gff3.gz \
    --output report.hg38.html
```

If you only need raw `create_report` (no cohort mode, no verifiers, no
auto-tracks), skip the skill entirely and use upstream directly —
see [igvteam/igv-reports](https://github.com/igvteam/igv-reports) docs.

Environment overrides (all optional):

| Var | Effect |
|---|---|
| `IGV_REPORTS_DB_CONFIG` | Path to your own databases YAML (same schema as the lab's) |
| `IGV_REPORTS_SIF` | Path to your own `igv-reports` apptainer SIF |
| `SAMTOOLS_SIF_DEFAULT` | Path to your own `samtools` SIF (verifier only) |
| `IGV_REPORTS_BIND` | Colon-separated bind paths for singularity (default `/data1/greenbab`). Empty string disables binding. |

Driver flags `--fasta` and `--no-default-tracks` let you skip the databases
YAML entirely without setting any env var. `--no-apptainer` forces the
PATH `create_report` path even on a SLURM node. The hermetic `tests/unit/`
suite runs anywhere with `pytest` + Python ≥ 3.10.

## When to use which entry point

| User request | Entry point |
|---|---|
| "Make an HTML for these 5 SV breakpoints in tumor.bam" | **build** |
| "Give me one HTML per patient for the cohort integration calls" | **cohort** |
| "create_report fails with 'not BGZF' on this gencode" | **prep-track** |

## Defaults (locked in)

- Tracks always loaded, top-to-bottom in the viewer:
  1. CpG islands (BED, plain or bgzipped)
  2. Gencode full annotation (GFF3.gz, **transcripts + exons + CDS + UTRs**, NOT a gene-level-only file)
  3. RepeatMasker (BED.gz, bgzipped + tabix-indexed)
  Plus the user's BAM(s), VCF, and any extra tracks they pass.
- `--flanking 300` bp on either side of each site (good for SV breakpoints
  and point variants alike). Override per call if needed.
- `--standalone` so the HTML is offline-viewable.
- Output filename includes the genome tag — e.g. `cohort.hg38.html` —
  to pass `enforce-genome-tag.sh`.
- Reference FASTA is resolved from `databases_config.yaml`:
  `/data1/greenbab/users/ahunos/apps/llm_configs/claude/profiles/databases/databases_config.yaml`
  (lab default; override with `$IGV_REPORTS_DB_CONFIG` or `--no-default-tracks` + `--fasta`).
  Supported genome IDs: `hg38`, `mm10`, `mm39`, `t2t_CHM13v2_plusY`, `GRCh37`.
- Per-genome default track availability is recorded in
  `references/databases_config_paths.md` — read it before assembling tracks
  so the skill doesn't try to load a track that doesn't exist for the
  selected genome (e.g., mm39 has no rmsk in our database).

## Sites BED format (critical)

igv-reports' BED parser reads fields **by position** and trips on a header
row (`ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'start'`). Always
emit a **plain headerless 4-column BED**:

```
chr    start    end    name
chr2   25227855 25342590 DNMT3A_full_gene
```

Tab-separated. The `name` becomes the row label in the report's variant
table — make it specific enough to identify the site after deduping.

By default `create_report` shows only the chr/start/end position columns
in the clickable table. To surface the `name` (or any extra columns from
a 5+ column BED), pass `--info-columns <colname>` to the driver:

```bash
python scripts/build_igvreports.py ... --info-columns name
python scripts/build_igvreports.py ... --info-columns gene_name,score
```

Column names are matched by header (so a `#chrom\tstart\tend\tname\tscore`
header works). For positional BED without a header, the convention is the
4th column = `name`, 5th = `score`, 6th = `strand`.

The project's `enforce-genome-tag.sh` hook requires a genome tag in the BED
filename: use `sites.hg38.bed`, not `sites.bed`.

### `--type` for BED-style sites

When the sites input is a BED (not a VCF), pass `--type mutation` to
`create_report` (or the driver). This gives the right viewer behavior at
each row — one locus per row, no split-screen, table on top. Without it,
some BED layouts trigger create_report's split-screen junction view by
heuristic. Use `--type variant` for VCF sites, or omit for create_report's
auto-detection (only safe with a VCF).

```bash
python scripts/build_igvreports.py ... --type mutation --info-columns name
```

## Pitfalls (the skill should encode and/or detect these)

| Symptom | Root cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `ValueError: invalid literal for int()` on first row | Header row in sites BED | Strip header — plain BED |
| `UnicodeDecodeError: byte 0x8b` reading a track | igv-reports reading bgzip as text | Filename must end `.gff3.gz` / `.bed.gz` AND be true bgzip (check with `file <name>` for "extra field") |
| `tabix: not BGZF` | Track was plain-gzipped, not bgzipped | Run **prep-track** entry point |
| `tabix: out of order` while indexing | GFF/GTF/BED records not pos-sorted within chr | **prep-track** does `sort -k1,1 -k4,4n` before bgzip |
| Annotation track empty in viewer | Tabix returns no rows in displayed window — often correct biology (e.g., CGI-distal site). Confirm with `tabix file region` |
| Genome ID lookup fails with `--genome hg38` | igv.js bundled IDs require internet at view + render time. Use `--fasta /path/to/local.fa` instead (always works offline) |

## How to run — quick recipe

Activate the snakemake conda env first; `create_report` lives there:

```bash
source /home/ahunos/miniforge3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh
conda activate snakemake
```

Then call the bundled driver script (use `scripts/` relative to the repo
root, or an absolute path to wherever the skill is checked out):

```bash
python scripts/build_igvreports.py \
    --sites results/run/inputs/sites.hg38.bed \
    --bam tumor.bam normal.bam \
    --vcf calls.vcf \
    --genome hg38 \
    --output results/run/reports/cohort.hg38.html
```

The driver:
- Resolves the genome's CpG / gencode / rmsk paths from `databases_config.yaml`
  (skipping any that don't exist for the chosen genome).
- Validates the sites BED is headerless and that all rows have `start < end`.
- Calls `create_report` with `--flanking 300 --standalone`.
- Writes a logs/ entry capturing the full command, the flanking value, the
  per-region embedded data sizes, and the resolved track list — required
  by the project's analysis-script audit-trail expectations.

For multi-sample cohorts, use `--samplesheet samplesheet.tsv` instead of
`--bam/--vcf`. Samplesheet format: `sample, bam_tumor, bam_normal, vcf, sites_bed`.
The driver emits one HTML per sample plus a top-level `index.html` that lists
all samples with links. Pass `--jobs N` to build the per-sample HTMLs in
parallel via `ThreadPoolExecutor` (each `create_report` call is I/O-bound on
BAM slicing, so threading scales well; `--jobs 6` for a 6-patient cohort
roughly 1/Nx wall-clock vs sequential). Default is `--jobs 1`. Layout matches
the ATLL viral-integration reference implementation:

```
results/<run>/
├── inputs/<sample>/sites.<genome>.bed
├── reports/<sample>.<genome>.html
├── reports/index.html
└── logs/run_<timestamp>.log
```

## prep-track — fixing a non-bgzip track

If a GFF3/GTF/BED.gz is plain-gzip rather than bgzip, igv-reports fails
silently or with an obscure error. Two modes:

**In-place** (with `.bak.original_gzip` backup) — replaces the original:

```bash
bash scripts/prep_track.sh /path/to/track.gff3.gz
```

**Sibling file** (non-destructive — original untouched) — write the
bgzipped+indexed track to a new path. Use this when other pipelines point
at the original `.gff3.gz` and you can't risk a brief window where the
file is replaced:

```bash
bash scripts/prep_track.sh /path/to/track.gff3.gz \
    --out /path/to/track.bgz.gff3.gz
```

The script (both modes):
1. Backs up the original to `<name>.bak.original_gzip` (in-place mode only).
2. `gunzip -c`s the file.
3. Sorts by `chr` then numeric `pos` (`sort -k1,1 -k4,4n`).
   (Gencode delivers records interleaved by feature type at the same locus —
   tabix requires pos-sorted.)
4. `bgzip`s to target.
5. `tabix -p <gff|gtf|bed>`s.
6. Verifies a sample tabix query returns rows.

Run from any env that has htslib's `bgzip` + `tabix` on PATH.

**Diagnostic** — `file <name>` for distinguishing the two formats:
- Plain gzip: `gzip compressed data, from Unix, original size <N>`
- bgzip:      `Blocked GNU Zip Format (BGZF; gzipped file with extra field)`

The `extra field` keyword is the bgzip giveaway.

## When generating an answer.md / run.sh for the user

The driver script (`build_igvreports.py`) deliberately abstracts the
underlying `create_report` flags — it sets `--standalone`, `--fasta`, the
`--flanking 300` default, and the YAML-resolved annotation tracks
internally so the user doesn't have to remember them. That abstraction is
good for ergonomics but bad for auditability: a reviewer reading the
`answer.md` later can't see what flags are actually being invoked without
opening the driver source.

To keep both: when you produce a runnable command for the user, **also
include a code block titled "Equivalent direct create_report invocation"
that shows the fully-expanded command** with all flags and resolved track
paths inline. The user should see the wrapper command they're going to
run AND the underlying command it expands to. Example:

````
## Run

```bash
python build_igvreports.py --genome mm10 --sites peaks.mm10.bed \\
    --bam ./data/ip.bam ./data/input.bam \\
    --output reports/peaks_qc.mm10.html
```

### Equivalent direct create_report invocation

```bash
create_report peaks.mm10.bed \\
    --fasta /data1/greenbab/database/mm10/mm10.fa \\
    --flanking 300 --standalone \\
    --tracks ./data/ip.bam ./data/input.bam \\
        /data1/greenbab/database/mm10/mm10_CpGIslands.bed \\
        /data1/greenbab/database/mm10/annotations/gencode.vM25.annotation.gtf.gz \\
        /data1/greenbab/database/RepeatMaskerDB/.../rmsk_all_repeats_mm10.bed.gz \\
    --title "ChIP-seq peak QC (mm10) — IP vs Input" \\
    --output reports/peaks_qc.mm10.html
```
````

This costs you ~10 lines and gives the reviewer a full audit trail. For
cohort runs, show the expanded form for ONE representative sample only —
the others differ only in BAM/VCF paths.

## Post-render verification

`scripts/verify_report.py` parses a built HTML and confirms it actually
contains what its inputs declared. Six checks: `html_exists`,
`html_min_size`, `region_count` (tableJson rows == sites BED rows),
`region_coords` (each BED row finds a matching `(chrom, start+1, end[, name])`
in tableJson — BED is 0-based, the HTML stores 1-based start), `region_sessions`
(sessionDictionary has one entry per row), and `tracks_present` (every
`name` from `--track-config` or every basename from positional `--tracks`
appears in the decoded igv.js session's `tracks[].name` list).

```bash
python scripts/verify_report.py \
    --html         results/<run>/reports/sample.hg38.html \
    --sites        results/<run>/inputs/sites.hg38.bed \
    --track-config results/<run>/inputs/tracks.json \
    --min-size-mb  1.0 \
    --out          results/<run>/reports/sample.verify.tsv \
    --fail-on-fail
```

Output is a TSV with columns `check / status / observed / expected / details`
(also printed to stdout). With `--fail-on-fail`, exits nonzero if any check
is FAIL — wire this into Snakemake / CI so the pipeline gates on render
quality, not just on `create_report`'s exit code.

NOTE: `--standalone` replaces every track URL with an inlined `data:` URL
after slicing, so URL paths are unrecoverable from the embedded session.
The check matches on track NAMES (which `--standalone` preserves) — for
`--track-config` JSON pass meaningful names; positional `--tracks` mode
uses basenames.

### Cohort-level verification (`verify_cohort.py`)

The per-sample verifier above confirms each HTML is internally consistent
but cannot tell whether sample-1's HTML accidentally embeds sample-2's BAM
(e.g., samplesheet typo, copy-paste, tumor/normal slot swap). For cohort
runs, `scripts/verify_cohort.py` adds five cross-sample checks:

| Check | What it asserts |
|---|---|
| `cohort_html_coverage` (global) | Each samplesheet row has exactly one HTML; flags missing + extras |
| `sample_tracks_match` (per-sample) | Each HTML's session contains every BAM/VCF basename declared in THAT row |
| `no_cross_sample_contamination` (per-sample) | Each HTML contains no basename that belongs to a DIFFERENT row's track columns (default tracks from `databases_config.yaml` are allow-listed) |
| `sample_id_embedded` (per-sample) | The `sample` column value appears in the HTML's `<title>` or filename |
| `index_consistency` (global) | `index.html` links exactly the samplesheet sample set; each target exists and is non-empty |

**Auto-invoked by default** at the end of `build_igvreports.py --samplesheet`
cohort runs. Disable with `--no-verify`; gate the pipeline with
`--fail-on-fail`. Standalone invocation:

```bash
python scripts/verify_cohort.py \
    --samplesheet samplesheet.tsv \
    --reports-dir results/<run>/reports/ \
    --genome hg38 \
    --out results/<run>/reports/cohort_verify.tsv \
    --summary results/<run>/reports/cohort_verify.summary.md \
    --fail-on-fail
```

The TSV adds a `sample` column on top of the per-sample verify schema, with
`"*"` for cohort-global rows. The markdown rollup (`--summary`) groups
PASS/FAIL counts by check + lists every failure inline.

Worked regression: `tests/integration/cohort_verify/scenarios.sh` builds a
3-sample cohort and asserts each of four corruption scenarios (missing
HTML, sample swap, index drift, truncated HTML) triggers the expected
check FAILs.

### Content verification (`verify_anchors.py`) — opt-in, slow

`verify_cohort.py` proves the HTML *says* the right thing. It can NOT
confirm the embedded BAM *slice* contains the data it claims to. Two
failure modes slip past structural checks:

1. **Sample swap with matching basename** — the cohort loop wired the wrong
   BAM into `sample_1`'s build, but the swapped BAM's `Path.stem` happens
   to match what `sample_1`'s row declared (or two files in different dirs
   share a basename). Track name passes; slice content is wrong.
2. **Silent empty slice** — region rendered, but the slice has 0 reads
   (failed `samtools index`, source BAM corruption, coords outside coverage).

`scripts/verify_anchors.py` closes the gap by re-running `samtools view -c`
against both the source BAM (at generate time) and the embedded slice (at
verify time), then comparing counts. Two-mode workflow:

```bash
# 1. After the cohort renders cleanly, freeze the read counts as a regression fixture.
python scripts/verify_anchors.py generate \
    --samplesheet samplesheet.tsv \
    --sites sites.hg38.bed \
    --out anchors.hg38.tsv

# 2. Re-verify any time after — works against a fresh build of the same inputs,
#    or to audit an existing HTML for unexpected content drift.
python scripts/verify_anchors.py verify-cohort \
    --samplesheet samplesheet.tsv \
    --reports-dir results/<run>/reports/ \
    --genome hg38 \
    --anchors anchors.hg38.tsv \
    --out results/<run>/reports/cohort_verify_anchors.tsv \
    --fail-on-fail
```

Or chained into the build driver:

```bash
# Freeze anchors at build time:
python scripts/build_igvreports.py --samplesheet ... --anchors-mode generate \
    --anchors anchors.hg38.tsv

# Verify a later build against frozen anchors:
python scripts/build_igvreports.py --samplesheet ... --anchors-mode verify \
    --anchors anchors.hg38.tsv --fail-on-fail
```

Anchors TSV schema (`#`-prefixed header per lab BED convention):

```
#sample	track_name	track_type	chrom	start	end	expected	tolerance	min	max	notes
```

`track_type` is one of:
- `bam` — `expected` is the count from `samtools view -c -F 1536` against
  the source BAM at generate time, and the same count against the
  embedded BAM slice at verify time. Default when the column is absent
  (backwards compat — pre-2026-05-19 anchor files keep working).
- `bedgraph` — `expected` is the number of data rows in the source
  bedGraph overlapping the region (CpG count for methylation data,
  peak count for ChIP coverage). Verify-time count comes from the
  wig/bedGraph slice embedded by igv-reports in the HTML — gzip-decoded
  in-memory, no samtools needed.

bedGraph tracks come from the samplesheet's `extra_tracks` column.
Anchors for them are generated automatically alongside BAM anchors when
you run `verify_anchors.py generate` against a samplesheet that includes
bedGraph entries (e.g. `*.5mC.bedgraph`, `*.5hmC.bg`, plain or `.gz`).

`tolerance` is a ratio (default 5%). `min`/`max` are absolute bounds that
override tolerance when set — useful for known-positive sites like
"this integration must have ≥20 reads" or "this promoter must have ≥10 CpGs".

samtools is resolved in this order: `--samtools-sif PATH` → `$SAMTOOLS_SIF`
→ `/data1/greenbab/users/ahunos/apps/containers/samtools_v1.23.1.sif` →
PATH `samtools`. SIF preferred per `rules/apptainer_vs_conda.md`.
bedGraph anchors don't require samtools.

**Why this matters for methylation viewers**: the silent-failure mode for
methylation reports is "region rendered, slice has 0 CpGs" — an empty
bedGraph slice because the source had no calls in that window, or
because the slice extraction silently dropped them. Pure structural
verification (`verify_cohort.py`) confirms the bedGraph track is in the
HTML but can't tell whether it's empty. The bedgraph-anchor mode closes
this gap.

**Why opt-in and not default:** the verify step shells out to samtools per
(sample × region) and indexes each slice — ~1 s/anchor. For a 6-sample
cohort × 50 regions that's ~5 min on top of the structural verify (which
runs in seconds). Reach for this when sample swap or content regression
is a real concern; the structural verifier is sufficient for routine builds.

Worked regression: `tests/integration/anchor_verify/scenarios.sh` builds a
2-sample cohort and asserts each of four content scenarios (tolerance
violation, min-bound violation, corrupted slice, missing anchor) triggers
the expected PASS / FAIL / SKIP outcome.

### Triage interpretation (`interpret_reports.py`) — human-first reading surface

After `verify-cohort` produces a checks TSV, `interpret_reports.py` rolls it
up into a single cohort-wide `interpretation.md`: a summary table (sample ×
verdict counts) then per-sample sections with a per-region verdict.

```bash
python scripts/interpret_reports.py \
    --checks results/<run>/reports/cohort_verify_anchors.tsv \
    --out    results/<run>/reports/interpretation.md
```

Per-region verdict, derived **solely** from the anchor results (no new
thresholds):

- `PASS` — every non-SKIP anchor for the region passed
- `FAIL` — every non-SKIP anchor failed
- `REVIEW` — mixed pass/fail across the region's tracks
- `UNVERIFIED` — every anchor was SKIP (region not rendered, or no tracks
  matched) — distinct from FAIL: nothing was checked

Regions sort FAIL-first (FAIL → REVIEW → UNVERIFIED → PASS) so the ones
needing attention sit on top of each sample section; FAIL/REVIEW/UNVERIFIED
get a per-track breakdown (observed vs expected + the reason), PASS collapses
to one line. If the checks TSV is missing or empty, a fallback file points
the reader at the HTML instead. It's a reporting tool — it always exits 0 on a
successful write; `verify_anchors --fail-on-fail` remains the CI gate.

Worked regression: `tests/integration/interpret/scenarios.sh` renders a
synthetic cohort and asserts the summary totals, FAIL-first ordering, the
malformed-input exit-2 path, and the missing-input fallback.

## Output and workflow logging

Every run logs to `logs/run_<YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS>.log` next to the reports dir.
The log captures:
- Resolved track paths (per genome, after databases_config.yaml lookup).
- The exact `create_report` command.
- The flanking value used (default **300 bp** — this is the value that's
  baked into all the embedded data slices, so audit trails depend on it).
- Per-region embedded data sizes (extracted post-render so the user can
  see which regions inflated the HTML).
- Total HTML size.

This satisfies CLAUDE.md §"Logging and Audit Trail" — every run is
reproducible from the log alone.

## Track choice nuances

For gencode on hg38, the default points at
`gencode.v47.annotation.gff3.gz` (full annotation, bgzip + tabix). This
gives transcript models with exons / CDS / UTRs. The gene-level-only
companion (`gencode.v47.genes.annotation.sorted.gff3.gz`) renders only
solid gene boxes and is fine for high-zoom views, but the full annotation
is the right default for read-level inspection at integration / fusion /
SV junctions.

For mouse genomes, `databases_config.yaml` ships `.gtf.gz` paths instead.
GTFs work in igv-reports if bgzip + tabix-indexed; **prep-track** converts
plain-gzip GTFs the same way it does GFF3s.

For T2T-CHM13, only the FASTA + GTF + CGI are indexed in our DB; rmsk is
absent and is auto-skipped by the driver. The variant table will load
without rmsk; flag this in the run log.

## Common-case examples

The `examples/` directory has runnable templates:

- `single_sample.sh` — one BAM + one VCF + a sites BED → one HTML.
- `cohort_samplesheet.sh` — TSV-driven multi-sample run.
- `prep_track_demo.sh` — convert a plain-gzip gencode to bgzip+tabix.
- `methylation_ont/` — ONT 5mC/5hmC viewer (BAM with `colorBy: basemod2`
  + per-sample bedGraph at fixed y-axis 0..100). End-to-end worked
  example with pre-sliced data; recipe.md explains the slots.

These are reference implementations; copy and edit them for new runs
rather than starting from scratch.

## Tests

Three-layer suite under `tests/`, orchestrated by `tests/run_all.sh`:

| Layer | What it covers | Runtime | Needs |
|---|---|---|---|
| **unit** (`tests/unit/`) | parser layer of `verify_report.py` + `verify_anchors.py` — TSV loading, status decision, session-entry locator, balanced-brace JSON extractor, decode round-trip — all with synthetic inputs | ~1 s | pytest |
| **smoke** (`tests/smoke/`) | `samtools_count` / `samtools_index` / full slice-decode-and-count round-trip against the committed `tests/fixtures/tiny_colo829.hg38.bam` (457 KB, sliced from public ONT COLO829 release) | ~3 s | pytest + samtools (SIF or PATH) |
| **integration** (`tests/integration/`) | end-to-end: build a 2-/3-sample cohort, structural verify, anchor verify, run 4 corruption scenarios per verifier | ~7 min cold, ~30 s cached | full cohort BAMs (lab default OR `IGV_REPORTS_TEST_BAM_{1,2,3}` env override). SKIPs with exit 77 if neither is available |

```bash
bash tests/run_all.sh                  # all three layers
bash tests/run_all.sh --unit-only      # ~1 s — fastest feedback loop
bash tests/run_all.sh --no-integration # ~12 s — works on any machine
bash tests/run_all.sh --integration-only
```

The fixture provenance + regeneration recipe live in
[tests/fixtures/README.md](tests/fixtures/README.md). Anchor counts the
smoke layer expects (chr2=5, chr7=9) are the contract — any fixture
regeneration that changes them must also update the smoke test constants.

## ONT methylation viewers (specialized path)

For per-read 5mC/5hmC visualization the positional `--tracks` API does
not work — you need named tracks with `colorBy: "basemod2"` on the BAMs
and `min: 0, max: 100` on the bedGraph tracks (cross-sample y-axis lock,
see `rules/igv.md`). Use the `--track-config <json>` passthrough:

```bash
# 1. Write a YAML spec listing samples (see tracks_spec.example.yaml).
# 2. Generate tracks.json with the right defaults baked in:
python scripts/generate_tracks_json.py \
    --spec tracks_spec.yaml --run-dir results/<run>/ \
    --out results/<run>/tracks.json

# 3. Build the report:
python scripts/build_igvreports.py \
    --sites results/<run>/sites.hg38.bed \
    --track-config results/<run>/tracks.json \
    --genome hg38 --flanking 0 \
    --type mutation --info-columns name \
    --output results/<run>/methylation_report.hg38.html
```

### Annotation shortcuts in the YAML

The default `--tracks` path (SV/variant viewers) auto-resolves CpG islands,
gencode, and RepeatMasker from `databases_config.yaml` when you pass
`--genome hg38`. On the `--track-config` (methylation) path you used to
have to hand-paste those paths into the YAML. As of the methylation-polish
round, you can use a `default:` shortcut for the same resolution:

```yaml
genome: hg38

annotation:
  # SHORTCUT — resolved from databases_config.yaml for the genome above.
  # Gets an Okabe-Ito color + sensible displayMode you can override per entry.
  - default: gencode
  - default: cgi
  - default: repmasker
  - default: epdnew_coding         # hg38 only
  - default: epdnew_noncoding      # hg38 only

  # Mix with EXPLICIT entries when needed (e.g. a pre-sliced custom track):
  - name: "My custom peak set"
    url: peaks/promoter_slices.bed
    format: bed
```

Valid `default:` keys: `cgi`, `gencode`, `repmasker`, `epdnew_coding`,
`epdnew_noncoding`. Mixing both forms is supported; order is preserved.
Override the canned `name`/`color`/`displayMode` per entry by adding the
field alongside `default:`. The shortcut needs a top-level `genome:` in
the spec and reads `databases_config.yaml` (resolution path same as the
SV viewer driver — points at `$IGV_REPORTS_DB_CONFIG` if set, else the
lab default; override per-run with `--db-config PATH`).

Key methylation-specific defaults:
- `--flanking 0` (sites BED already encodes the window — promoter/gene span).
- `--info-columns name` (surface the BED `name` column in the variant table).
- `--type mutation` (one-locus view per row; not split-screen).
- bedGraph not bigwig — igv-reports cannot slice `.bw` directly.

When `--track-config` is set the driver bypasses the auto-resolved
default annotation tracks (CGI / gencode / rmsk) and the `--bam` /
`--vcf` / `--extra-track` flags — the JSON is the source of truth.
Build annotation slices into the JSON instead.

**`--apptainer` is auto-detected**: the driver flips to the dedicated
igv-reports 1.16.0 SIF (`/data1/greenbab/users/ahunos/apps/containers/igv-reports_1.16.0.sif`,
83 MB, pulled from Galaxy depot) when `SLURM_JOB_ID` is in the
environment — i.e. running on a compute node where the NFS conda
cold-start tax matters (`rules/apptainer_vs_conda.md`). On the login
node it stays on the conda env. Override with `--apptainer` /
`--no-apptainer`; the decision lands in the run log.

Full recipe and rationale: `references/methylation_ont.md`. Worked
example with real data: `examples/methylation_ont/`.

## Exporting HTML and PNG side-by-side (`--also-png`)

The HTML report is the deep-dive view; sometimes you also need static
PNGs you can email, drop in a Slack channel, or paste into slides. The
driver's `--also-png` flag invokes the sister `igver` skill against the
**same sites BED and same track list** that drove `create_report`, so
both artifacts cover identical regions with matching content.

```bash
python scripts/build_igvreports.py \
    --samplesheet samplesheet.tsv \
    --genome hg38 \
    --output-dir results/run/reports/ \
    --jobs 6 \
    --also-png \
    --png-dpi 600 --png-display-mode collapse
```

Output layout per sample:

```
results/run/reports/
├── <sample>.hg38.html              # interactive
├── png_<sample>.hg38/
│   ├── igver_regions.bed           # flanked BED with UIDs (igver -r)
│   ├── igver_input.txt             # track paths, one per line (igver -i)
│   ├── manifest.tsv                # bridge: BED row ↔ PNG ↔ HTML row
│   └── png/
│       ├── chr1-100-500.alpha.png  # one PNG per region
│       └── chr2-0-700.beta.png
└── index.html
```

### How consistency is guaranteed — five levers

1. **Single sites BED with `--flanking` baked in.** The driver writes
   `igver_regions.bed` with `start − flanking` and `end + flanking`
   already applied (clamped to 0 on the low side); igver sees the same
   coordinates create_report's igv.js viewer slices to.
2. **Single resolved track list.** On the default (positional) path the
   exact `[BAMs, VCF, extras, defaults]` list passed to `create_report` is
   also written to `igver_input.txt`. On the `--track-config` path the
   local-path `url:` entries from the JSON are extracted (http(s) URLs are
   skipped — igver can't consume them).
3. **Matched display mode.** Default is `--png-display-mode collapse` to
   line up with the HTML's `BAM_DEFAULTS displayMode: COLLAPSED`. Override
   to `expand` for per-read SV inspection on both artifacts.
4. **UID-based filenames.** The BED's `name` column (auto-assigned
   `region_<idx>` when missing) becomes both the HTML table label (via
   `--info-columns name`) and the PNG filename suffix
   (`<chr-start-end>.<uid>.png`). A user finds the same region in either
   artifact by the same string.
5. **`manifest.tsv` audit trail.** Per-sample TSV with columns:
   `bed_row_idx, uid, chrom, start_orig, end_orig, start_flanked,
   end_flanked, region, png_path, html_path, html_table_row`. One row
   per region in BED order. `verify_cohort.py` reads this to run three
   PNG-side checks (count matches, exist + non-empty, html-row contiguity).

### Resolution of the `igver` invocation

Order, first match wins:
1. `--igver-cmd '...'` (split on whitespace — supports `apptainer exec ... igver`).
2. `$IGVER_CMD` env var (same shape).
3. `igver` on PATH.
4. Lab apptainer SIF at `/data1/greenbab/software/images/igver_latest.sif`
   (only if reachable).

If none resolve, the build exits before invoking create_report so you
don't pay the HTML cost before finding out PNGs are unavailable.

### Methylation caveat (bigwig vs bedGraph)

The HTML methylation path uses **bedGraph** tracks (igv.js consumes
those directly); igver's per-read methylation view uses **BAMs** with
`--color-by BASE_MODIFICATION`, and igver's cross-sample comparison view
uses **bigwig** tracks. Content can be made identical only if both
formats trace back to the same `modkit pileup` output (`modkit bedmethyl
tobigwig` of the same bedGraph). The driver's `--also-png` passes the
JSON's `url:` entries through verbatim, so if your YAML lists bedGraphs
they'll go to igver as-is — igver will render them but the result may
look different from the HTML's color-coded per-read view. For
publication-quality methylation PNGs, supply a parallel `tracks.json`
that lists bigwigs and run `igver` separately (see `rules/igv.md`).

For SV/variant viewers this caveat doesn't apply — both render the
identical BAMs and the result is content-equivalent.

### Cross-artifact verification

The driver runs an **inline existence check** right after igver returns:
walks each expected PNG path (`<chr>-<start>-<end>.<uid>.<ext>` derived
from the manifest) and fails the build with an actionable message if
any are missing or zero-byte. This catches igver's documented
silent-exit-0 failure mode (egg-link install without the IGV Java
binary; see `rules/igv.md`) — `proc.returncode != 0` alone misses it.

In addition, `verify_cohort.py` then runs three checks per sample:

| Check | Catches |
|---|---|
| `png_count_matches_bed` | partial igver run (SIGKILL mid-batch), stale manifest from a previous build, filename collisions |
| `pngs_exist_and_nonempty` | empty IGV screenshots (< 10 KB threshold; useful screenshots are typically ≥ 50 KB) |
| `png_html_row_alignment` | manifest rows referencing a different HTML, html_table_row not contiguous 1..N |

`--png-min-size-kb 5.0` lowers the threshold if you have legitimate
no-data regions where igver produces a near-empty PNG.
