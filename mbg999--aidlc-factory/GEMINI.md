# AIDLC Development Repo

Custom fork of [AWS AI-DLC](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows) (v0.2.0).
Extends upstream with a multi-agent orchestrator, skills enforcement, hallucination
prevention, CodeGraph integration, and persistent memory (Engram).

> This repo IS the AIDLC toolchain itself. Modifying it means modifying the workflow engine,
> not running it against an application codebase.

## Multi-agent orchestrator (GitHub Copilot)

The orchestrator routes development requests through specialized stage agents using
JSON Schema handoff contracts. Invoke from Copilot Chat in **Agent mode** by typing `/`
and selecting a prompt from `.github/prompts/`.

| Prompt / Phase | What it does |
|-----------------|-------------|
| `/factory-spec` | Workspace scout + requirements analysis (Phase 0) |
| `/factory-plan` | Execution plan + optional unit decomposition (Phase 1) |
| `/factory-build` | Parallel code-gen + build/test with file-glob locks (Phase 5) |
| `/factory-review` | Reviewer pool: code / security / performance / simplifier |
| `/factory-ship` | Release notes, ADRs, CHANGELOG, CI/CD wiring |
| `/factory-resume` | Resume interrupted run from last checkpoint |
| `/factory-replay` | Re-run from a specific stage |
| `/factory-state` | Show run status, stage, budget |
| `/factory-help` | Full command reference |

Agent definitions: `.github/agents/**/*.agent.md`. Runtime spec: `.aidlc-orchestrator/runtime/index.md`.

## Key rules when modifying this repo

- **Contracts are the interface**: stage agent I/O defined by JSON Schema in `.aidlc-orchestrator/contracts/`. Changes to agent outputs must update contracts.
- **Rule files are source of truth**: `aidlc-rules/aws-aidlc-rule-details/` is the corpus. Duplicate logic is a bug.
- **Installer is the distribution mechanism**: new orchestrator files must be wired into `aidlc-scripts/install_aidlc.py`.
- **Runtime state is gitignored**: `.aidlc-orchestrator/runs/`, `.aidlc-orchestrator/knowledge/`, `.codegraph/` — never commit these.
- **Parity**: body content of stage agents must stay in sync across `.claude/`, `.cursor/`, `.opencode/`, and `.github/agents/` (Copilot uses `*.agent.md` + platform-specific frontmatter).

---

## VS Code / Copilot setup

`.vscode/settings.json` enables nested subagent spawning and registers AIDLC file locations:

```json
{
  "chat.subagents.allowInvocationsFromSubagents": true,
  "chat.agentFilesLocations": { ".github/agents": true },
  "chat.promptFilesLocations": { ".github/prompts": true },
  "chat.instructionsFilesLocations": { ".github/instructions": true }
}
```

The orchestrator custom agent declares an `agents:` allowlist and includes the `agent` tool — both are required for subagent delegation.

---

## Copilot execution constraints

Copilot differs from Claude Code in important ways:

### 1. Sequential-only agent calls

Copilot processes one `agent` tool call at a time. The orchestrator MUST:
- Invoke agents sequentially (one at a time, wait for result, then proceed)
- Never attempt to invoke multiple agents in a single response
- Use the `agent` tool only — `Task(subagent_type=...)` is Claude Code syntax and will fail

### 2. Spawn budget

Keep total `agent` invocations per command under 8 to avoid context exhaustion:

| Command | Max spawns | Strategy |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| `factory-spec` | 3 | workspace-scout + analyst ×2 (or inline scout for greenfield) |
| `factory-plan` | 2 | workflow-planner + unit-decomposer (skip story-writer unless requested) |
| `factory-build` | 4 units × 3 spawns = 12 max | Cap at 4 units per run; use `merged_plan_generate` for SMALL tier |
| `factory-review` | 1–2 | Default to `reviewer-code` only; add others only when manifest specifies |
| `factory-ship` | 1 | ship-agent only |

**If a `factory-build` run has more than 4 units**, split into multiple invocations or ask the user which units to prioritize.

### 3. Tool availability

Tool names differ between VS Code Copilot and Copilot cloud agent. Agent frontmatter includes both portable aliases (`search`, `read`, `edit`, `execute`, `agent`) and VS Code-specific names (`search/codebase`, `read/terminalLastCommand`). Unrecognized names are ignored per environment.

- **`engram/*` tools** are NOT available in Copilot. Skip all Engram operations silently. Log `[Knowledge] DEGRADED: engram unavailable, skipped` at most once per run.
- **`edit` tool** is required for file creation and editing. If missing, report the missing tool and stop.

### 4. Skill resolution (Copilot)

Resolve skills in this order (see also `.github/instructions/aidlc-skills.instructions.md`):

1. `.github/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
2. `.agents/custom-skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
3. `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
4. `~/.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`

### 5. Reducing spawns

- **Inline workspace-scout** (greenfield only): perform the scan inline instead of spawning. Log `[Inline] workspace-scout`.
- **Skip story-writer** (default): unless the user explicitly requests user stories. Log `[Skipped] story-writer`.

## Environment setup

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Installer dry-run
python aidlc-scripts/install_aidlc.py --tool copilot --dry-run

# Validate / audit scripts
python3 aidlc-scripts/factory_validate.py
python3 aidlc-scripts/factory_custom_skills.py --dry-run
python3 aidlc-scripts/factory_skill_drift.py --report
```

Env vars: `AIDLC_ROOT` (repo root override), `AIDLC_MODEL_<STAGE>` (per-stage model override).

## Copilot-specific instruction files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | Repository-wide instructions (this file) |
| `.github/copilot-review-instructions.md` | Custom code review rules for Copilot Code Review |
| `.github/copilot-commit-instructions.md` | Conventional commit format with AIDLC-specific types and scopes |
| `.github/copilot-pull-request-instructions.md` | PR template and merge conventions |
| `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md` | Path-specific instructions (skills, Python scripts) |
| `.vscode/settings.json` | Subagent spawning + AIDLC file locations |

These files are loaded automatically by GitHub Copilot in VS Code, Copilot cloud agent, and Copilot code review where supported.
