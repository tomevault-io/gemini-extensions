# AGENTS.md

This file is the authoritative agent contract for Mnemosyne. It provides guidance
to Claude Code and any other AI agent working with this repository.

## Project Overview

Mnemosyne is the skills and session-memory store for the HomericIntelligence agentic
ecosystem. It stores, organizes, and shares learnings from experiments, debugging sessions,
and development work as flat skill files under `skills/`.

Mnemosyne is **not** a plugin marketplace — the `/advise` and `/learn` commands live in the
**Athena** plugin, which is the marketplace. Mnemosyne only holds the corpus those commands
read and write. Do not add a `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` to this repo.

**Purpose**: Capture team knowledge so Claude can `/advise` before starting work and prevent
repeated mistakes.

**Ecosystem**: Works with ProjectOdyssey (training), ProjectKeystone (DAG execution), ProjectScylla (testing), Myrmidons (agent provisioning), AchaeanFleet (agent images), and ProjectHephaestus (shared utilities).

## Commands

### /advise

Search the skills registry before starting work.

**When to use**: At session start, before experiments, when debugging unfamiliar errors.

**Workflow**:

1. Read user's goal/question
2. Search the `skills/` corpus for related skill files
3. Read matching skill `.md` files
4. Return: what worked, what failed, recommended parameters

**Example**:

```text
User: /advise training a model with GRPO
Claude: Found 2 related skills...
- training/grpo-external-vllm: Use external vLLM server for GRPO training
  - Key finding: vllm_skip_weight_sync errors require separate GPU setup
  - Recommended: batch_size=4, learning_rate=1e-5
```

### /learn

Save learnings after a session (auto-creates PR).

**When to use**: After experiments, debugging sessions, or implementing new patterns.

**Workflow**:

1. Read entire conversation history
2. Extract: objective, steps taken, successes, failures, parameters
3. Auto-generate skill filename: `<topic>-<subtopic>-<short-4-word-summary>`
4. Create git worktree for branch isolation (all work done in worktree, not base repo)
5. Generate skill file from template:
   - `skills/<name>.md` with YAML frontmatter + all required sections
   - Optional `skills/<name>.notes.md` for raw session details
6. Create branch: `skill/<name>`
7. Commit and push
8. Create PR with summary
9. Clean up worktree with `git worktree remove`

**Auto-trigger**: UserPromptSubmit hook reminds about `/learn` when you type session-ending keywords.

**Format notes**:
- Category/name are auto-generated (no user prompting)
- Work isolation: git worktrees (auto-created per branch, cleaned up after PR)
- Single flat `.md` file with YAML frontmatter
- Branch name: `skill/<name>`

## Plugin Standards

### Required Structure

```text
skills/<name>.md             # Main skill file with YAML frontmatter + markdown content
skills/<name>.notes.md       # (Optional) Additional context from development session
```

All skills are now flat files in the `skills/` directory. Metadata is stored as YAML frontmatter in each `.md` file.

**Exception**: `plugins/tooling/mnemosyne/` stays in `plugins/` — it's the command infrastructure (advise, learn), not a skill.

### Required Fields

**YAML Frontmatter** (in `skills/<name>.md`):

- `name`: Lowercase, kebab-case identifier
- `description`: Trigger conditions with specific use cases ("Use when: (1) ..., (2) ...")
- `category`: One of 9 approved categories
- `date`: Creation date (YYYY-MM-DD)
- `version`: Semantic version (e.g., "1.0.0")
- `user-invocable`: Set to `false` for internal/sub-skills (declutters slash command menu)
- `tags` (optional): Searchable keywords array

**Markdown Sections**:

- Overview table (date, objective, outcome)
- When to Use (trigger conditions)
- Verified Workflow (what worked, including Quick Reference subsection)
- **Failed Attempts table (REQUIRED)** — must include: Attempt, What Was Tried, Why It Failed, Lesson Learned
- Results & Parameters (copy-paste ready configs, expected outputs)

### Categories

| Category | Description |
| ---------- | ------------- |
| `training` | ML training experiments and hyperparameters |
| `evaluation` | Model evaluation and metrics |
| `optimization` | Performance tuning and speedups |
| `debugging` | Bug investigation and fixes |
| `architecture` | Design decisions and patterns |
| `tooling` | Automation and developer tools |
| `ci-cd` | Pipeline configurations and CI fixes |
| `testing` | Test strategies and patterns |
| `documentation` | Paper writing, academic reviews, knowledge docs |

### Quality Rules

1. **Specific descriptions**: Include trigger conditions, not vague summaries
2. **Failures required**: Document what didn't work and why
3. **Copy-paste ready**: Parameters and configs should work immediately
4. **No duplication**: Link to external docs instead of copying

### Key Development Principles

1. KISS - *K*eep *I*t *S*imple *S*tupid -> Don't add complexity when a simpler solution works
1. YAGNI - *Y*ou *A*in't *G*onna *N*eed *I*t -> Don't add things until they are required
1. TDD - *T*est *D*riven *D*evelopment -> Write tests to drive the implementation
1. DRY - *D*on't *R*epeat *Y*ourself -> Don't duplicate functionality, data structures, or algorithms
1. SOLID - *S**O**L**I**D* ->
  . Single Responsibility
  . Open-Closed
  . Liskov Substitution
  . Interface Segregation
  . Dependency Inversion
1. Modularity - Develop independent modules through well defined interfaces
1. POLA - *P*rinciple *O*f *L*east *A*stonishment - Create intuitive and predictable interfaces to not surprise users

### Cross-Repository Compatibility

Skills should be generic enough to work across multiple repositories:

1. **No `source:` in frontmatter**: Remove repository-specific source fields
2. **Use placeholders**: Replace hardcoded paths with `<project-root>`, `<test-path>`, `<package-manager>`
3. **Add "Verified On" section**: Document where the skill was validated with a table:
   ```markdown
   ## Verified On

   | Project | Context | Details |
   |---------|---------|---------|
   | ProjectName | PR #XXX context | [notes.md](../references/notes.md) |
   ```
4. **Move specifics to references**: Put project-specific commands, paths, and code in `references/notes.md`
5. **Generic workflows**: Write workflows that can be adapted to any repository structure

**Optional plugin.json fields for cross-repo support**:
- `requires.tools`: Array of tool requirements (e.g., `[{"name": "mojo", "version": ">=0.25.0"}]`)
- `requires.languages`: Programming languages this skill applies to
- `verified_on`: Array of projects where the skill was validated

## Hooks Configuration

The project uses Claude Code hooks for automatic retrospective prompts.

**Important**: SessionEnd hooks CANNOT display messages to users (Claude Code limitation).
This project uses UserPromptSubmit hooks instead.

**UserPromptSubmit Hook**: Triggers when user types session-ending keywords (exit, quit,
clear, done, finished, etc.) to remind about `/learn`.

**NEW in v2.1.0**: Hooks support `once: true` field to execute only once per session:
```json
{
  "hooks": [{
    "type": "command",
    "command": "script.sh",
    "once": true
  }]
}
```

See `.claude/settings.json` for configuration and
`plugins/tooling/mnemosyne/hooks/settings.json.example` for reference.

**Skills location**: All skills live as flat files in `skills/` (e.g., `skills/skill-name.md`). The only exception is
`plugins/tooling/mnemosyne/` which contains the /advise and /learn
command infrastructure.

## Contributing a Skill

1. Run `/learn` after a valuable session (preferred — auto-generates filename and structure)
2. Or manually create from `templates/skill-template.md`
   - Copy to `skills/<name>.md`
   - Fill YAML frontmatter (name, description, category, date, version)
   - Fill all required sections (Overview, When to Use, Verified Workflow, Failed Attempts, Results & Parameters)
   - Optional: create `skills/<name>.notes.md` for raw details
3. File format: flat markdown with YAML frontmatter, no nested directories
4. Filename convention: `<topic>-<subtopic>-<short-4-word-summary>.md` (all lowercase, kebab-case)
5. PR will be validated by CI before merge (skill-file frontmatter + sections)

## Dependencies

`pyproject.toml` is the **canonical** dependency specification for this project (ADR-017).
Runtime dependencies live in `[project.dependencies]`; the development toolchain (pytest,
pytest-cov, mypy, yamllint, ruff, jsonschema, build, twine) lives in the uv-native
`[dependency-groups]` dev group. `uv.lock` is the committed, reproducible lockfile.

- Install everything: `uv sync` (add `--group dev` explicitly, or `--locked` in CI)
- Run tasks: `just validate`, `just test`, `just check`, `just package` — each recipe wraps
  `uv run`, so no manual environment activation is needed
- Equivalent raw invocations: `uv run python scripts/validate_plugins.py`,
  `uv run python -m pytest tests/`, `uv build`

The canonical CI `package` check builds the Python wheel + sdist (`mnemosyne_skill_utils`,
the shared skill-parsing helper) with `uv build` and smoke-tests the installed wheel.
Mnemosyne no longer ships a plugin-marketplace bundle — Athena is the plugin distribution;
Mnemosyne is the skills/memory store.

`[project.optional-dependencies] dev` is retained purely for pip compatibility
(`pip install .[dev]`); it mirrors the uv `[dependency-groups]` dev group. The CI
`security/dependency-scan` (`pip-audit`) job audits the exact runtime dependencies exported
from `uv.lock`, so there are no separate `requirements*.txt` mirrors to keep in sync.
