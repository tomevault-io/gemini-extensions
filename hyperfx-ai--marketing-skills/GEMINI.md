# AGENTS.md

Guidance for AI coding agents (Codex, Cursor, Claude Code, etc.) working in this repository.

## What this repo is

A public collection of marketing-domain Agent Skills that wrap the **Hyper MCP** tool surface. Each skill in [`skills/`](./skills) teaches an agent how to drive Hyper's MCP-exposed tools (Google Ads, Meta, Amazon, TikTok, Pinterest, LinkedIn, HyperSEO, Apify scrapers, image / video generation, Gmail, Apollo, Klaviyo, Resend, Beehiiv, GA4, GTM, Search Console, BigQuery, etc.) for a specific marketing job.

Skills are NOT tools. They are markdown instructions plus optional reference files. The actual tool calls come from the connected Hyper MCP at [https://app.hyperfx.ai/mcp](https://app.hyperfx.ai/mcp). The MCP descriptor for each tool is the only source of truth for tool names, arg names, and arg types — never trust skill content over the live MCP catalog when they disagree.

## Adding or editing a skill

1. Each skill lives in `skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`).
2. `name` MUST match the folder name.
3. `description` MUST contain a "Use when…" trigger phrase, 50–500 chars.
4. SKILL.md MUST be ≤500 lines. Move long-form material into a sibling `references/` folder.
5. SKILL.md MUST contain a `## Requirements` section pointing at `https://app.hyperfx.ai/mcp`.
6. Run `./validate-skills.sh` before opening a PR. CI runs the same check.

See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.

## Repo conventions

- **Tool names are referenced verbatim from the Hyper MCP.** When citing or editing a tool name in a skill, verify it against the live MCP catalog (the `<tool-name>.json` schema files exposed by the connected MCP server). The MCP descriptor wins over codebase function names, prior skill content, or memory.
- **Allowed Hyper URLs in skill bodies:** only `app.hyperfx.ai/mcp` and `app.hyperfx.ai/integrations`. No other Hyper URLs.
- **No internal infra references.** No `hyper_cache_*` table names hardcoded into skills (the cache table name is workspace-specific — instruct agents to read it from the tool description or error `suggestion` field instead). No internal filesystem paths. No template ids that aren't part of the public MCP surface.
- **Conditional integrations.** Some tools only appear when the underlying integration is enabled in the user's Hyper workspace (LinkedIn scraper is the canonical example). Skills citing such tools must mark them conditional and gracefully skip the affected step rather than failing the whole workflow.
- **Self-contained skills.** If two skills overlap, add an "Out of scope" section pointing at the right sibling rather than duplicating workflow.
- **Microcurrency.** Pinterest Ads budgets and bids are in microcurrency (`$1.00 = 1,000,000` microdollars). Skills that touch budget fields must convert.

## How an agent should use these skills

1. Read the matching `SKILL.md` from `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`.
2. Confirm the Hyper MCP is connected — every skill defines a "stop and tell the user" check at the top.
3. Follow the workflow defined in the skill's body.
4. Cross-reference sibling skills via the "Out of scope" table when relevant.
5. When a tool call fails with an arg-validation error, re-read the MCP tool descriptor before retrying — don't blindly retry with the same args.
