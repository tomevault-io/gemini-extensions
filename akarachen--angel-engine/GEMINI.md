# Angel Engine Agent Notes

These notes apply to the whole repository, except vendored code that carries its
own instructions.

## Core Rule

Keep protocol and platform adaptation in the runtime adapters. Codex-specific,
ACP-specific, Kimi-specific, OpenCode-specific, or desktop-host-specific wire
semantics must be normalized before they reach shared engine state, client
snapshots, NAPI bindings, or desktop UI projection.

Do not fix provider quirks in `state/`, reducer code, `angel-engine-client`,
NAPI, or desktop unless the quirk has already been converted into a
protocol-neutral engine concept by an adapter.

## Packages

- `crates/angel-engine/`
  - Rust engine library and protocol-neutral state machine.
  - Owns protocol-neutral commands, events, state, reducers, capabilities,
    display-message construction, protocol effects, and transport primitives.
  - Shared state/reducer folders must not inspect provider names or raw provider
    JSON shapes. They should operate on `EngineCommand`, `EngineEvent`,
    `ConversationCapabilities`, and protocol-neutral state types only.

- `crates/angel-provider/`
  - Rust provider adapter crate over `angel-engine`.
  - Owns the `ProtocolAdapter` interface plus built-in Codex and ACP
    implementations.
  - Adapter folders:
    - `src/codex/` owns all Codex app-server wire format, hydrate replay
      normalization, request/response/notification decoding, model catalog
      parsing, and Codex-specific command encoding.
    - `src/acp/` owns all ACP wire format, session update decoding, config
      option parsing, tool call mapping, and ACP-specific command encoding.

- `crates/angel-engine-client/`
  - Rust client API over `angel-engine`.
  - Owns client ergonomics, runtime process IO, JSON-RPC line ingestion,
    snapshots, thread/session helpers, and desktop-friendly primitives such as
    `thread_settings`, `reasoning_level`, `model_list`, `available_modes`,
    `set_model`, `set_mode`, and `set_reasoning_level`.
  - It may orchestrate when to initialize, hydrate, inspect, drain, or send
    thread events. It must not parse provider wire formats or invent
    provider-specific behavior. If a runtime needs special interpretation, add
    it to the corresponding `angel-provider` adapter and expose the normalized
    result through engine state.

- `crates/angel-engine-client-napi/`
  - Node.js N-API binding for `angel-engine-client`.
  - This package should stay thin: convert Rust client APIs into JS-callable
    classes/functions and generated TypeScript definitions.
  - Do not add settings policy, protocol normalization, stream merging rules, or
    desktop UI assumptions here. Rebuild it after Rust API/type changes with:
    `npm --prefix crates/angel-engine-client-napi run build`.

- `desktop/`
  - Electron desktop application.
  - Uses `@angel-engine/client-napi` as its backend API.
  - `src/main/` owns Electron main-process services: IPC routing, chat metadata
    persistence, session lifetime, abort handling, and elicitation handoff.
  - `src/main/chat/projection.ts` may map normalized NAPI snapshots/events into
    desktop shared chat types. It must not infer Codex/ACP semantics from raw
    runtime payloads.
  - `src/shared/` owns TypeScript types shared by main and renderer.
  - `src/lib/engine-model-adapter.ts` owns assistant-ui runtime adaptation and
    renderer-side message accumulation.
  - `src/pages/`, `src/chat/`, `src/components/`, `src/app/` own UI only.
    Renderer state may track draft user selections, but available models,
    reasoning levels, modes, and current runtime settings should come from the
    engine/client snapshots.
  - The desktop SQLite database stores chat/project metadata only. It should not
    store messages; restored messages should come from runtime hydrate via the
    engine/client path.

- `crates/test-cli/`
  - Test/support CLI crate. Keep it as a consumer of public APIs rather than a
    place for engine behavior.

- `vendor/agent-client-protocol/`
  - Vendored ACP reference material. Treat as third-party code and avoid edits
    unless intentionally updating the vendored dependency.

## Layer Boundaries

1. Wire format enters and leaves through adapters.
   - Decode provider messages into `EngineEvent`.
   - Encode `ProtocolEffect` into provider JSON-RPC.
   - Normalize provider hydrate/replay quirks before creating history replay
     chunks.
   - For protocol fields with a closed value set, use typed enums from the
     owning crate when available, or serde enums with exact canonical wire names
     in the adapter. Do not add string alias compatibility, casing fallbacks, or
     `contains`/prefix/suffix guessing for protocol ids. Unknown values should
     fail fast so casing drift is caught during development.
   - Missing or malformed boundary input should throw immediately. Do not fill
     missing IDs, text, arrays, objects, or settings with `""`, `[]`, `{}`, or
     other silent defaults unless the provider adapter is explicitly normalizing
     a documented provider quirk into a protocol-neutral concept.

2. Reducers and state are protocol-neutral.
   - Reducers apply `EngineEvent` to state.
   - State/display code may understand common concepts such as turns, actions,
     tool phases, elicitations, context, model, mode, reasoning, and usage.
   - State/display code must not patch over missing provider fields or branch on
     Codex/ACP-specific payload conventions.

3. Client packages expose primitives, not policy.
   - `angel-engine-client` can make workflows ergonomic and expose snapshots.
   - NAPI mirrors those primitives to JS.
   - Neither layer should duplicate adapter parsing or desktop projection
     behavior.
   - TypeScript clients should use upstream generated types directly whenever
     possible. Do not hand-write local copies of SDK/NAPI types, invent provider
     tool input interfaces, or add compatibility type aliases when the upstream
     package exports the real type. If a type name is wrong, rename all uses
     directly instead of leaving an alias.
   - Avoid broad escape-hatch types such as `unknown`, `any`,
     `Record<string, unknown>`, or catch-all JSON object aliases as internal API
     shapes. If an upstream SDK exposes a broad boundary type, keep it local to
     that boundary, narrow it immediately, and pass precise types through the
     rest of the code.
   - Prefer normal TypeScript property access on precise types. Do not add
     one-off helper functions such as `requireString`, `requiredStringField`,
     `mutableObjectField`, or ad hoc object-field readers for values that should
     already be typed.

4. Desktop projects normalized data.
   - Desktop may reshape snapshots/events for UI components.
   - Desktop should not maintain a second source of truth for model lists,
     reasoning levels, available modes, tool phases, or restored history.
   - If restored or streamed state is wrong, first inspect the engine snapshot
     and adapter normalization before patching UI code.

## Settings Rules

- Model list, reasoning level, and mode support are engine/client primitives.
- Frontend code should not define provider defaults like default model lists or
  default reasoning levels.
- Use `undefined`/missing values for "no override" across IPC/API boundaries.
  UI-only sentinels are allowed inside renderer state, but must be stripped
  before sending requests.
- Do not add aliases for unpublished APIs. If an API name is wrong, delete or
  rename it directly.
- Do not keep compatibility aliases just to preserve old local names. Update the
  import sites and call sites to the canonical exported name in the same change.
- Do not add compatibility aliases for runtime/provider names. Runtime names
  must be canonical product ids exactly as exposed in UI and settings, such as
  `copilot`; do not accept alternate spellings like vendor-prefixed names,
  binary names, or legacy names unless the product explicitly publishes that id.

## Temporary Artifacts

- Put screenshots and other one-off verification captures in a temp directory
  such as `/private/tmp/angel-engine/`. Do not leave them in the repository root
  or the current working directory unless the user explicitly asks for a
  checked-in artifact.

## Package Manager Files

- Do not edit `pnpm-lock.yaml` by hand. Any lockfile changes must be produced by
  pnpm commands such as `pnpm install`, `pnpm patch`, or `pnpm patch-commit`.
- After pnpm changes workspace metadata or lockfiles, run the repository
  formatter instead of manually preserving or rewriting pnpm's formatting.

## Verification

Common gates:

```sh
cargo test -p angel-engine -p angel-engine-client
cargo fmt --all --check
npm --prefix crates/angel-engine-client-napi run build
npm --prefix desktop run typecheck
git diff --check
```

Use narrower tests while iterating, but run the relevant full gate before
declaring a cross-layer change done.

Before handing changes to the user for acceptance, rebuild NAPI whenever the
Rust engine, Rust client, NAPI crate, or any snapshot/event/settings type used
by desktop changed:

```sh
npm --prefix crates/angel-engine-client-napi run build
```
