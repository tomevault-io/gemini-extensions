## Project Overview

TNLean is a Lean 4 formalization of the **Fundamental Theorem of Matrix Product States**, **Quantum Wielandt theory**, and finite-dimensional **quantum-channel theory** (following Wolf's *Quantum Channels & Operations*). Built on Mathlib v4.32.0.

## Build Commands and Mathlib Cache Policy

**Canonical cache rule:** never rebuild Mathlib from source in a fresh, cloned,
or cache-cleared worktree. After adding or updating a Mathlib dependency, fetch
its prebuilt artifacts **before** any `lake build` or local Lean check:

```bash
# Fetch pre-built Mathlib artifacts after a Mathlib/toolchain/dependency update.
# Do this before `lake build` or `lake env lean`; otherwise Mathlib can rebuild
# from source and take hours.
lake exe cache get

# Only after the cache fetch succeeds:
lake build
lake env lean TNLean/Path/To/File.lean
```
# Check for sorrys/axioms in changed files
rg -n "sorry|axiom" TNLean/Path/To/File.lean || true

# Blueprint validation (requires leanblueprint; run after lake build succeeds)
cd blueprint && leanblueprint checkdecls

# Blueprint web/PDF generation
cd blueprint && leanblueprint web
cd blueprint && leanblueprint pdf
```

## Lean Toolchain & Dependencies

- **Lean**: v4.32.0 (pinned in `lean-toolchain`)
- **Mathlib**: v4.32.0
- **checkdecls**: Blueprint declaration checker (PatrickMassot/checkdecls)
- **Gametheory**: Custom Brouwer fixed-point theorem library (LionSR/Brouwer)

### Lean Options (lakefile.toml)

- `relaxedAutoImplicit = false` — strict implicit arguments, no auto-implicit
- `pp.unicode.fun = true` — pretty-prints `fun a ↦ b`
- `maxSynthPendingDepth = 3` — typeclass synthesis depth limit

## Architecture

The source lives in `TNLean/` and is organized into **layers 0-6 with sublayers**.
See `docs/import_structure.md`; `TNLean.lean` is generated.

### Quick Reference (from the docs above)

- **PR titles**: `type(scope): description` -- types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`,
  `doc`, `style`, `ci`, `chore`; scope is shortened module path without
  `TNLean/` prefix
- **Issue titles**: plain mathematical titles, not `type(scope): ...`; use
  `Tracking: <area>` for trackers and keep titles bracket-free
- **Naming**: Definitions `camelCase`, predicates `IsPrefix`, theorems `snake_case`, files `CamelCase.lean`
- **Proof integrity blockers**: `sorry`, `admit`, `native_decide`, `unsafeCast`, `axiom`, circular reasoning
- **Blueprint prose**: Pure mathematics only — no Lean identifiers in text, no software jargon (see banned terms list in blueprint style guide)
- **Paper references**: Cite theorem numbers in docstrings (e.g., "Wolf Thm 6.3", "arXiv:1606.00608 Appendix A")
- **Mathematical renames**: When renaming a declaration whose old name encodes misleading terminology (banned vocabulary in `docs/prose_style.md` §2), skip the `@[deprecated] alias` and state the reason in the PR body (see `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md` §Mathematical-language renames).

## Workflow

### Mathlib Scouting

When writing new proofs or closing sorrys, scout Mathlib first:
- Use `exact?`, `apply?`, `rw?`, `simp?` tactics
- Grep Mathlib source: `.lake/packages/mathlib/Mathlib/` for related definitions/theorems
- Reuse Mathlib lemmas rather than reproving from scratch
- Not needed for cosmetic fixes, docstrings, imports, or renaming

### Tactic Self-Improvement Loop

Proof text must grow sublinearly with mathematical content: a tactic pattern
paid for three times gets abstracted, not copied a fourth time. The full
process is in `docs/tactic_development.md`; the pattern ledger is
`docs/tactic_patterns.md`. In every proof-writing session:

1. **Consult** the ledger's promoted section first and use existing custom
   tactics/simp sets (`mpv_ext`, `transfer_simp` in
   `TNLean/MPS/Tactic/Basic.lean`) where they apply — hand-writing a pattern
   that has a promoted tactic is a review-blocking style issue.
2. **Detect** repetition while writing, and in proof-heavy PRs run:

   ```bash
   python3 scripts/tactic_pattern_scan.py
   ```

3. **Record** noticed repetition as a candidate entry in the ledger — in the
   same PR; recording is cheap and needs no design decision.
4. **Promote** when a pattern hits ≥ 3 occurrences across ≥ 2 files (rule of
   three): prefer a lemma, then a simp set, then `@[grind]` annotations +
   `grind` for goal-closing patterns, then a macro, then an elab tactic
   (weakest mechanism that removes the duplication). Refactor the known call
   sites and update the ledger entry.

### Blueprint Updates

When adding or completing (removing sorry from) theorems/lemmas:
1. Update the corresponding entry in `blueprint/src/chapter/*.tex`
2. Add `\lean{DeclarationName}` and `\leanok` tags for new results
3. Add `\leanok` to `\begin{proof}` for newly proven results
4. Validate with `lake build` then `leanblueprint checkdecls`

### General Rules

- Prefer minimal diffs
- Do not leave unrelated new sorrys
- Before changing theorem statements, first try to complete the proof using existing lemmas
- If a mathematical result looks wrong or suspiciously general, check the LaTeX sources in `Papers/` and `Notes/` for the original theorems

### Faithfulness rule

**A theorem is "formalized" only when its Lean signature has no hypothesis
absent from the cited source's statement.** Adding hypotheses — even
mathematically natural ones — produces a *different* theorem and must
not be marked `\leanok` against the source's blueprint label.

This applies to every formalized result, not only those undergoing active
paper-realignment. The check is on hypotheses, not just conclusions:

- A Lean theorem whose conclusion matches the source but whose hypotheses
  are stricter than the source's is **not** the formalization of the source
  theorem. It is a different theorem (a corollary or specialization).
- The blueprint label citing the source must point to a Lean statement
  with the source's hypothesis set, not to a stronger-hypothesis variant.
- If the only available Lean theorem has extra hypotheses, the blueprint
  must either: (a) drop the `\leanok` and `\lean{...}` tags from the
  source-labelled entry, or (b) state the source's theorem as a
  separate blueprint entry with `\leanok` only after a faithful Lean
  version exists.

Scope-restricted theorems may be marked `\leanok` only against a blueprint
statement that explicitly states the restriction. Such an entry must not be
presented as the source theorem itself. The unrestricted source theorem remains
unformalized until a Lean statement with the source's hypothesis set exists.

A paper-gap note in `docs/paper-gaps/` is required whenever a
stricter-hypothesis Lean version is the *only* available formalization of
a source theorem. The note must identify the missing hypothesis and the
elimination plan (formalize the source-faithful version, derive the
stricter version inside a particular argument, etc.).

This rule was retroactively codified after the equalMPS audit
(`docs/paper-gaps/cpsv16_equalMPS_gauge_phase_gap.tex`) found that the
proportionality-conditional Lean theorem was being treated as the
formalization of the proportionality-free source lemma.

### Paper-realignment mode

When the formalization has drifted from the cited source and the work is
**realigning the Lean development to the paper** (replacing wrong hypotheses,
removing divergent structures, restating theorems to match the source), the
default `sorry`/`axiom` blockers from `docs/PROOF_INTEGRITY.md` are temporarily
relaxed. The priority is **getting the statements right**; proofs are
restored after.

#### Source-citation requirement

In paper-realignment mode every restated definition, hypothesis field, or
theorem **must carry a docstring referencing the source by paper label or line
range**. The minimum acceptable forms:

- `arXiv:1606.00608, eq:II_CF1` — equation/theorem label
- `arXiv:1606.00608, lines 1170–1192` — line range in the local source PDF/tex
- `CPSV16, Lemma Lem1` — paper short name plus internal label
- `Wolf §6.2` — published section reference

For Lean fields and theorems whose mathematical content is being aligned to a
specific paper passage, the docstring must say *which* passage. Inline
identifiers without a source reference are unreviewable in this mode: a
reviewer cannot tell whether the field/theorem is faithful or invented.

This rule applies whether or not the proof is `sorry` — the *statement* is
the load-bearing artifact during realignment.

#### Marking unfaithful theorems

A theorem or lemma is **unfaithful** when its proof relies on a hypothesis or
intermediate lemma that is known to deviate from the cited source — typically
because the hypothesis was smuggled into the formalization, the proof
shortcuts a load-bearing source step, or the result is restated more weakly
than the paper would prove. Unfaithful theorems must carry a docstring
marker so a future reader (or a follow-up PR) can locate them.

The marker is a docstring section starting with `**Unfaithful:**` that names
the load-bearing deviation, cites the paper-gap note documenting it, and
sketches the elimination plan. Minimum form:

```
**Unfaithful:** This proof currently relies on `<hypothesis or lemma>`,
which deviates from `<paper, label or line range>`. Documented in
`docs/paper-gaps/<note>.tex`. Elimination: replace by `<faithful
substitute>`; tracked in `<issue or PR>`.
```

The marker propagates to dependent theorems: any theorem whose proof
transitively calls an unfaithful one is itself unfaithful and must carry its
own marker. The marker is removed only when every transitively-cited
dependency is faithful.

Reviewers should not approve a paper-realignment PR that introduces an
unfaithful theorem without the marker. The marker makes the deviation
auditable and keeps the elimination plan visible.

#### Locally-fixable deviations

Not every paper deviation rises to **Unfaithful**. When the cited source
contains a small typo, a locally-fixable gap (a missing or off-by-one
constant, a clarification needed at one step), or a scope restriction that
the paper proves more generally but the local result handles only a
sub-case, the formalization may proceed without the full **Unfaithful**
ceremony. These cases must still:

- Cite a paper-gap document (under `docs/paper-gaps/`) that records the
  deviation in mathematical terms; if no note exists, write a short one
  before merging.
- Use a lighter-weight in-source marker. The recommended forms are
  `**Scope restriction (...):**` for sub-case proofs, or
  `**Local fix (...):**` for typo/constant adjustments. Both forms must
  reference the paper-gap document by file path.
- Be inline-readable: the marker should let a reader recognize the
  deviation without leaving the file.

The **Unfaithful** marker is reserved for deviations that would be
mathematically wrong without follow-up work (the proof is unprovable, or
the statement smuggles an unwarranted hypothesis). The lighter markers
are for deviations that are mathematically correct as stated, just
narrower or differently phrased than the source.

A paper-realignment PR may:

- Delete fields, hypotheses, or whole theorems that are documented as
  divergent from the cited source (with the divergence recorded in
  `docs/paper-gaps/`).
- Leave `sorry` in proof bodies whose old proof depended on the deleted
  data, when the paper-faithful replacement is the next step.
- Cascade signature changes through downstream consumers, also using
  `sorry` if necessary, rather than reverting to keep the build proof-clean.

A paper-realignment PR must:

- Cite the relevant `docs/paper-gaps/*.tex` note documenting the divergence
  in the PR description.
- Identify, in the PR description, every `sorry` introduced and the
  paper-faithful theorem that will discharge it.
- Be scoped tightly — no unrelated refactors or feature additions.
- Be followed by tracked implementation issues for the missing
  paper-faithful proofs.

In paper-realignment mode the standard "do not add sorry" rule is the
*wrong* heuristic: keeping a divergent proof intact to avoid `sorry`
preserves a result the source does not assert. Reviewers should evaluate
paper-realignment PRs against the paper-gap note and the planned
follow-up, not against the temporary `sorry` count.
