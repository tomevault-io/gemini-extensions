# MIRIX Project Rules for Cursor AI

## Project Overview
MIRIX is a Multi-Agent Personal Assistant with an Advanced Memory System. It features a six-agent memory architecture (Core, Episodic, Semantic, Procedural, Resource, Knowledge Vault) with screen activity tracking and privacy-first design.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Python 3.10+, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Redis, Kafka
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Vite, TailwindCSS
- **LLM Integration**: Multiple providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Azure, etc.)
- **Observability**: LangFuse
- **Testing**: pytest
- **Linting**: Ruff, Pyright

## Code Standards

### Python Guidelines
1. **Follow PEP 8** strictly
   - Use 4 spaces for indentation (no tabs)
   - Max line length: 79 characters for code, 72 for docstrings
   - Use snake_case for variables/functions, CamelCase for classes, ALL_CAPS for constants
   - Group imports: standard library, third-party, local application (blank lines between groups)

2. **Type Hints**
   - Always use type hints for function signatures
   - Use `Optional[T]` for nullable types
   - Use `Union` or `|` syntax for multiple types
   - Example: `def create_user(user_id: str, name: Optional[str] = None) -> User:`

3. **Documentation**
   - Use triple-quoted docstrings for all modules, classes, and functions
   - Include parameter descriptions, return types, and examples where helpful
   - Document complex logic with inline comments explaining WHY, not WHAT

4. **Error Handling**
   - Use specific exception types (ValueError, TypeError, HTTPException, etc.)
   - Never use bare `except:` clauses
   - Log errors with appropriate context

5. **Async/Await**
   - Use async/await for I/O operations
   - Prefix async functions with `async def`
   - Always await async calls

### Async Architecture (Critical)
The codebase is fully async-native. Violating these rules will break the server.

1. **All new manager methods in `mirix/services/` MUST be `async def`**
2. **Never call `asyncio.run()` inside the server** — the event loop is already running
3. **Never use sync DB drivers** — use `asyncpg` (not `pg8000`), `aiosqlite` (not `sqlite3`)
4. **Never use sync Redis** — use `redis.asyncio` only, never `redis.Redis`
5. **Never use `requests`** — use `httpx.AsyncClient` for all HTTP calls
6. **Wrap unavoidable sync calls** with `asyncio.to_thread()` — only for these 5 approved touch-points:
   - LangFuse SDK (no async version)
   - Gmail OAuth (inherently blocking)
   - SQLAlchemy DDL at startup
   - Cleanup job entry point
   - Pure CPU helpers with no I/O
7. **Do NOT add new sync touch-points** — check `docs/Mirix_async_native_changes.md` first

### Project-Specific Patterns

#### 1. Memory System Architecture
- **Meta Agent** orchestrates specialized memory agents
- **Sub-agents** extract specific memory types (episodic, semantic, etc.)
- **Memory extraction** happens via queue-worker architecture
- Each memory type has dedicated ORM models, schemas, and managers

#### 2. Database Patterns
- **ORM Models**: Located in `mirix/orm/` using SQLAlchemy
- **Schemas**: Located in `mirix/schemas/` using Pydantic
- **Managers**: Located in `mirix/services/` for business logic
- Always use `OrganizationMixin`, `UserMixin`, `AgentMixin` where applicable

#### 3. Agent Execution Flow
- `step()` method is the main agent execution loop (like LangChain's AgentExecutor)
- `inner_step()` handles single LLM interactions with tool calls
- `save_agent()` persists agent state to database
- Steps are logged to the `steps` table for audit/analytics (write-only)

#### 4. Message Flow
- Queue messages (transient) != Database messages (persistent)
- Database messages stored via `MessageManager.create()` after agent execution
- Messages link to steps via `step_id` foreign key
- Messages table used for conversation history and search

#### 5. API Patterns
- REST endpoints in `mirix/server/rest_api.py`
- Client SDK in `mirix/client/remote_client.py`
- Always authenticate with JWT or API key
- Use `create_or_get_user()` to ensure user exists before operations

#### 6. Settings Management
- Environment variables defined in `mirix/settings.py`
- Use Pydantic BaseSettings with `env` prefix `MIRIX_`
- Provider API keys in `ModelSettings`
- Tool configs in `ToolSettings`

#### 7. Tool Execution
- User-defined tools run in `ToolExecutionSandbox` for security
- Tools defined in `mirix/functions/function_sets/`
- Memory tools in `memory_tools.py`, base tools in `base.py`

### Code Review Checklist
Before suggesting changes, verify:
- [ ] No duplicate code or configurations
- [ ] Type hints are present and correct
- [ ] Error handling is specific and informative
- [ ] Docstrings follow PEP 257
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or API keys
- [ ] Database operations use proper ORM patterns
- [ ] Async functions are properly awaited
- [ ] Tests are included for new functionality
- [ ] Logging uses appropriate levels (debug, info, warning, error)

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
1. **Do NOT** confuse queue messages with database messages
2. **Do NOT** call `step_manager.get_step()` - steps are write-only audit logs
3. **Do NOT** bypass `create_or_get_user()` - always ensure users exist first
4. **Do NOT** create agents without proper `CreateAgent` schema objects
5. **Do NOT** forget to persist agent state with `save_agent()`
6. **Do NOT** use `message.step` relationship - it's never loaded in practice
7. **Do NOT** add duplicate environment variables in settings.py

### Testing Guidelines
- Tests located in `tests/` directory
- Use pytest fixtures defined in `conftest.py`
- Mock external LLM calls in tests
- Test user isolation, memory extraction, and API endpoints
- Run tests with: `pytest tests/`

### Documentation
- Do NOT create documentation files unless explicitly requested
- Do NOT create README files proactively
- Update existing docs when making significant architectural changes
- Keep code comments concise and focused on WHY

### Git Workflow
- Commit messages should be clear and descriptive
- Run linters before committing: `ruff check .` and `pyright`
- Resolve merge conflicts carefully (especially in `poetry.lock`)
- Do NOT commit secrets or API keys

### File Organization
```
mirix/
├── agent/          # Agent implementations (MetaAgent, SubAgents)
├── client/         # Client SDK (remote_client.py, client.py)
├── database/       # Database connectors (PostgreSQL, Redis)
├── functions/      # Tool definitions and function sets
├── llm_api/        # LLM provider integrations
├── orm/            # SQLAlchemy ORM models
├── queue/          # Message queue (Kafka) implementation
├── schemas/        # Pydantic schemas for validation
├── server/         # FastAPI REST API (rest_api.py, server.py)
├── services/       # Business logic managers (user, agent, memory)
├── prompts/        # System prompts for agents
└── settings.py     # Environment configuration
```

### When Analyzing Code
1. Always trace from ORM models → Schemas → Managers → APIs
2. Check both where code is defined AND where it's called
3. Distinguish between operational flow and audit logging
4. Verify parameter signatures match between callers and callees
5. Understand the meta-agent → sub-agent orchestration pattern

### Performance Considerations
- Use bulk operations for database writes when possible
- Leverage Redis caching for frequently accessed data
- Monitor LLM token usage and costs
- Use async patterns for I/O-bound operations
- Consider queue backpressure for high-throughput scenarios

### Security Best Practices
- User-defined tools MUST run in `ToolExecutionSandbox`
- Validate all user inputs with Pydantic schemas
- Use parameterized queries (ORM handles this)
- Sanitize log messages (no sensitive data)
- Implement proper authentication and authorization

## Response Style
- Be concise and clear
- Provide code examples when helpful
- Reference specific files and line numbers
- Explain complex logic flows step-by-step
- Don't make changes unless explicitly requested
- Ask clarifying questions when intent is ambiguous
