## Mission

RiceVM is a Dis virtual machine and Limbo compiler in Rust.
The Dis VM is a register machine that executes bytecode compiled from the Limbo programming language.
The project includes a built-in Limbo compiler that compiles `.b` source files to `.dis` bytecode
without depending on the reference compiler from Inferno OS.
Priorities, in order:

1. Correct implementation of the Dis VM specification and Limbo language.
2. Clean, idiomatic Rust with safe abstractions over VM internals.
3. Clear separation of concerns across workspace crates.
4. Maintainable and well-tested code.

## Core Rules

- Use English for code, comments, docs, and tests.
- Keep `unsafe` usage minimal and well-documented; prefer safe Rust wherever possible.
- Never use `.unwrap()` or `.expect()` in non-test code (enforced by `make lint`). Production code should never panic.
- Prefer small, focused changes over large refactoring.
- Add comments only when they clarify non-obvious behavior.
- Do not add features, error handling, or abstractions beyond what is needed for the current task.
- Add tests for every bug fix and new feature to prevent regression.

## Writing Style

- Use Oxford commas in inline lists: "a, b, and c" not "a, b, c".
- Do not use em dashes. Restructure the sentence, or use a colon or semicolon instead.
- Avoid colorful adjectives and adverbs. Write "TCP proxy" not "lightweight TCP proxy", "scoring components" not "transparent scoring components".
- Use noun phrases for checklist items, not imperative verbs. Write "redundant index detection" not "detect redundant indexes".
- Headings in Markdown files must be in the title case: "Build from Source" not "Build from source". Minor words (a, an, the, and, but, or, for, in,
  on, at, to, by, of) stay lowercase unless they are the first word.

## Repository Layout

- `crates/ricevm-core/`: Shared types (Module, Opcode, Instruction, TypeDescriptor, and errors). No runtime logic.
- `crates/ricevm-loader/`: Binary format parser for `.dis` module files. One public function: `load(&[u8]) -> Result<Module, LoadError>`.
- `crates/ricevm-execute/`: Execution engine with 176 opcode handlers, heap, GC, built-in modules ($Sys, $Math, $Draw, $Tk, $Keyring, $Crypt, and
  audio),
  virtual device files, and file-based module loading.
- `crates/ricevm-limbo/`: Built-in Limbo compiler. Lexer, parser, code generator, and .dis binary writer.
  Compiles Limbo source to Dis bytecode end-to-end without depending on the reference limbo.dis compiler in the Inferno OS.
  Codegen is kind-aware: it tracks `NumKind` (word, big, and real) per local; sidecar maps for array element types, channel element types, and ADT
  layouts; and a fixup pass for forward-referenced calls and spawns.
- `crates/ricevm-cli/`: CLI with `run`, `dis`, and `compile` subcommands.
- `external/inferno-os/`: Git submodule of the Inferno OS repository (866 pre-compiled `.dis` files, Limbo source, and reference VM source in
  `libinterp/xec.c` for correctness validation).
- `Makefile`: GNU Make wrapper around `cargo` commands (`make test`, `make build`, `make lint`, etc.).
- `rust-toolchain.toml`: Pinned Rust toolchain (1.92.0) with `rustfmt`, `clippy`, and `rust-analyzer`.

## Architecture

### Crate Dependency Graph

```
ricevm-cli
├── ricevm-core
├── ricevm-loader → ricevm-core
└── ricevm-execute → ricevm-core and ricevm-loader
```

`ricevm-execute` depends on `ricevm-loader` for runtime module loading (the `load` opcode reads `.dis` files from disk).

### Key Internal Modules in `ricevm-execute`

| Module         | Purpose                                                                                          |

### Key Design Decisions

- Package names use hyphens (`ricevm-core`); Rust identifiers use underscores (`ricevm_core`).
- The heap uses `HashMap<u32, HeapObject>` with monotonic IDs starting at `HEAP_ID_BASE` (0x0100_0000);
  pointers stored as `Word` (i32) in frames.
- Array element references use a `heap_refs` table with `HEAP_REF_FLAG` sentinel, resolved during double-indirect addressing.
- `ArraySlice` heap type provides shared-storage views into parent arrays (required for Bufio buffer semantics);
  all operations (`cvtac`, `slicela`, `pread`, `pwrite`, channel send/recv) resolve slices to their parent.
- `slicela` adjusts reference counts for pointer-containing elements (e.g., `array of string`) to prevent
  premature freeing during operations like mergesort.
- Unified virtual address space: frame addresses are low, each module's MP has a unique range starting at
  `MP_BASE` (0x0080_0000) with `MP_STRIDE` (0x0010_0000) between modules, heap IDs above `HEAP_ID_BASE`.
  The `decode_virtual_addr()` function decodes addresses back to `AddrTarget`.
- `caller_mp_stack` in `VmState` tracks caller module MPs during loaded module execution.
- Branch instructions: `if src OP mid, goto dst` (not `if src OP dst, goto mid`).
- Case instructions (`casew`, `casec`, and `casel`) use binary search matching the reference Dis VM (`xec.c`).
- `casel` entries are 24 bytes (not 20) due to LONG alignment padding.
- Multi-module execution: loaded modules' MPs are swapped (not cloned) to persist state across calls.
- Built-in function dispatch prefers name matching over signature hash matching (avoids collisions like read/write).
- `movmp` looks up the type descriptor to determine copy size (mid is a type index, not a byte count).
- Data initialization (`data.rs`) uses type descriptors for array element sizes and writes to the active buffer context
  (parent array or MP) for correct nested array initialization.
- Builtin return value copy in `mcall` transfers 4 bytes to the caller's return pointer; big-returning functions
  (like `seek`) and tuple-returning functions write their results directly through the return pointer.
- Type conversions match the reference: `cvtfw`/`cvtfl` round (±0.5), `cvtrf`/`cvtfr` convert f32↔f64,
  `cvtwc`/`cvtcw` format/parse decimal strings, `cvtfc` uses `%g` format.
- `expw`/`expl`/`expf` use repeated-squaring with base from mid and integer exponent from src.
- Cooperative threading: `spawn` creates threads in a queue, the run loop rotates every 2048 instructions,
  `recv` on empty channels blocks the thread, `send` on full channels blocks the thread,
  both directions unblock on state change. Cloned MP adjusts heap ref counts.
- Alt table format: `{nsend, nrecv}` header followed by 8-byte `{channel_ptr, data_ptr}` entries.
- Per-thread error string (`last_error`) implements the `werrstr`/`%r` mechanism.
- Portable I/O via `FileTable` (no `libc` dependency) with in-memory pipe support and non-blocking stdin
  (background reader thread prevents `sys->read` from freezing all VM threads).
- Virtual device files: `/dev/sysctl`, `/dev/sysname`, `/dev/user`, `/dev/time`, `/dev/cons`, `/dev/null`,
  `/dev/random`, `/dev/drivers`, `/prog/N/{status,wait,ns,ctl}`, and `/env/*`.
- `$Keyring` module provides real MD5 and SHA1 digests via the `md-5` and `sha1` crates;
  auth functions (`readauthinfo`, `auth`, etc.) are stubs returning nil.
- Nil dereferences (channel, array, string, list) are caught in the run loop and dispatched to
  exception handler tables, matching the reference Dis VM behavior.
- Library modules with `entry_pc = -1` return success immediately (no init function).
- SDL2 for GUI is behind an optional `gui` feature flag.
- Audio support (`/dev/audio` and `/dev/audioctl`) is behind an optional `audio` feature flag (cpal backend).
- `export_real`/`export_real32` use correct argument order (address, then value).

### Reference Implementation

The original Dis VM source is in `external/inferno-os/libinterp/`:

| File       | Lines | What It Covers                                        |

Always compare against these files when fixing instruction correctness issues.

## Required Validation

Run `make lint` and `make test` for any change. Key targets:

| Target     | Command           | What It Runs                                                                    |
|------------|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Format     | `make format`     | `cargo fmt`                                                                     |
| Lint       | `make lint`       | `cargo clippy` with `-D warnings -D clippy::unwrap_used -D clippy::expect_used` |
| Test       | `make test`       | All workspace tests with `--nocapture`                                          |
| Test Limbo | `make test-limbo` | Built-in vs reference compiler correctness and coverage                         |
| Build      | `make build`      | Release build                                                                   |
| Coverage   | `make coverage`   | `cargo tarpaulin` with XML and HTML output                                      |
| Audit      | `make audit`      | `cargo audit` on dependencies                                                   |

## Testing Expectations

- Unit tests live in each crate's source files using `#[cfg(test)]` modules.
- Integration tests for the loader live in `crates/ricevm-loader/tests/`.
- Pipeline tests (loader to executor) live in `crates/ricevm-cli/tests/`, including tests with real Inferno `.dis` files.
- Property-based tests cover arithmetic commutativity/associativity, string slice bounds, and conversion roundtrips.
- Regression tests exist for every major bug fix (movmp, casew, slicea, slicela ref counting, cvtac ArraySlice, byte2char, channel blocking, spawn,
  etc.).
- Fuzz testing for the loader is set up in `crates/ricevm-loader/fuzz/`.
- No public API change is complete without a corresponding test.
- The built-in Limbo compiler can compile and run programs:
  ```
  ricevm-cli compile hello.b
  ricevm-cli run hello.dis --probe external/inferno-os/dis
  ```
- `make test-limbo` compiles programs with both the built-in and reference compilers, runs both outputs on RiceVM, and
  compares results. Phase 1 checks correctness (11 tests), Phase 2 checks compilation coverage (159 Inferno programs).

## Commit and PR Hygiene

- Keep commits scoped to one logical change.
- PR descriptions should include:
    1. Behavioral change summary.
    2. Tests added or updated.
    3. `make lint && make test` passes (yes/no).

Suggested PR checklist:

- [ ] Unit tests added or updated for logic changes
- [ ] Integration test added for new user-facing behavior
- [ ] `make lint && make test` passes
- [ ] Docs or README updated (if API surface changed)
