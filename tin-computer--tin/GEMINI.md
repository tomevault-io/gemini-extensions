# Tin agent instructions

Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md), [feature status](docs/feature-status.md),
and the relevant guide in [docs/README.md](docs/README.md) before changing a subsystem.
Current code and pinned workflow definitions are authoritative. This file records
cross-cutting implementation safeguards, not historical deployment logs.

## Scope and implementation

- Tin is a Python/FastAPI service with packaged HTML, CSS and JavaScript, Postgres
  product projections, Temporal orchestration, code.storage artifacts and E2B compute.
- Keep one explicitly registered workflow engine. Do not introduce a node-graph engine,
  frontend framework, provider fallback or plugin marketplace as incidental work.
- Preserve unrelated edits and use an isolated worktree when another agent is working.
  Do not deploy, change provider configuration, rewrite history or publish repositories
  without explicit authority. A merged PR is not a production deployment.
- Do not copy runtime dependencies from unrelated repositories. Keep the import-linter
  boundaries and the explicit registry; no wildcard workflow registration.

## Identity and routing

- Project membership is the authorization boundary for HTTP and MCP. Workspace
  administration never grants access to sibling projects or project files.
- Clerk owns sign-in, verification and OAuth consent. Do not build a second identity
  system or trust an incoming Host header to advertise OAuth/MCP service URLs.
- OAuth access requires trusted Tin resource binding from Clerk introspection or a
  signature-verified access JWT. `TIN_LITE_MCP_OAUTH_CLIENT_IDS` is an optional explicit
  legacy policy for unbound tokens, not a new-user enrollment step. Never admit clients
  by name, DCR success or membership alone, or override conflicting signed claims.
  Keep MCP and connection setup on the shared verifier; browser sessions stay separate.
- Dashboard routes are ordinary paths: /system, /chat, /activity, /decisions, /files,
  /integrations and /billing. Use the History API and explicit FastAPI shell routes,
  not hash routing or a catch-all that intercepts APIs, MCP, webhooks or callbacks.
- TIN_LITE_PUBLIC_URL is the configured service origin. Optional TIN_LITE_APP_URL
  defaults to it. Legacy-origin compatibility is inbound only; it must never supply
  new service links. Keep issuer, memberships and validated auth returns unchanged
  during hostname changes. See [domain configuration](docs/app-domain-rollout.md).
- Onboarding and invitations are idempotent. Accept a valid project invitation before
  provisioning a personal container. Do not add hidden-project preferences; deletion
  uses the existing creator-authorized, confirmation-bound service and keeps billing history.

## Durable execution

- Temporal histories carry identifiers and small control facts, never prompts, file
  bodies, credentials, transcript contents or model output. Activities perform I/O.
- Every run pins its immutable definition/source revision, normalized inputs, review
  policy and applicable auth/rate contract. Saved configuration changes affect future
  runs only. Preserve replay compatibility and immutable historical migrations.
- Product reads come from Postgres, not Temporal or in-memory execution handles.
  Files remain retrievable through code.storage after sandbox deletion.
- Canonical writes are serialized per project and use expectedHeadSha. Validate the
  active sandbox lease, generation and fencing token before accepting results.
- Receipt external effects before dispatch. Reuse completed effects on retries;
  uncertain paid/provider attempts are not silently purchased again or counted as zero.
- Preserve retained output and later edits on publication conflicts. Applying a saved
  version requires the existing authenticated exact-change/revision contract.
- Schedules use Temporal's existing dispatcher, skip overlap, and bounded catch-up.
  Calendar support is declared by the selected workflow, not inferred from its name.

## Models, sandboxes and connections

- New Codex compute is API-only. The provider credential stays on the switchboard;
  protected controllers receive temporary run-bound relay grants. Never restore pooled
  ChatGPT auth.json, a login broker, refresh write-back or an OAuth compute fallback.
- Historical OAuth pins retain their accounting and artifacts but cannot create new
  compute. Never silently reprice or switch them to API execution.
- Tin uses TIN_LITE_LUNA_API_KEY for its trusted OpenAI adapter. Model routes explicitly
  name provider, model and capabilities. Optional provider credentials do not register
  routes automatically. Never expose reusable keys in a sandbox, log or project file.
- Keep the protected controller separate from user/agent commands. Preserve output
  bounds, result validators, worker isolation, fenced egress, TLS proxy and cleanup.
- Browser execution is a specific pinned sandbox profile, not permission for arbitrary
  private code to access the network. Rebuild and verify images when runtime contracts change.
- Project integrations enforce selected resources and bounded operations. Custom API
  connections use the trusted service gateway; author code receives a service binding,
  not an API key. Preserve endpoint/redirect/private-address checks and stable operation IDs.
- Private workflow packages require explicit validation and activation of an immutable
  revision plus the existing operator allowlist. workflow.code supports bounded code,
  managed model steps, service requests and eligible schedules. Private procedures remain
  isolated and on demand; they are not interactive project.task sessions.
- Public contributions also support deterministic Python and multi-step managed-model code,
  not only Codex procedures. Validate packages without executing author code; select them
  explicitly in PUBLIC_WORKFLOWS for catalog publication. Keep examples unregistered, and
  preserve the separate private activation gate. See docs/adding-a-workflow.md.

## Billing

- Self-host customer billing is off by default; operators still pay their providers.
  Hosted credits use the existing ledger, ownership checks and configured limits.
- Both Start here workflows and their approved initial setup children remain included.
  Later independent or scheduled work does not inherit this exemption.
- Use configured estimates before admission and internal per-provider funding. Charge
  verified actual usage once. Do not expose holds or require quote-approval loops in UI.
- Preserve usage/rate pins, uncertain attempts, reservations and financial history.
  Missing usage is not free. Supplier overruns do not increase customer ceilings.
- Do not enable live Stripe payments, add automatic refunds, grant credits or enroll
  accounts as incidental test setup. Use synthetic providers and disposable test schemas.

## Product and content

- Dashboard and MCP share the same authenticated services, prerequisites and idempotency
  contracts. Chat can start workflows only through the normal project-bound run API.
- Chat is a shared durable project transcript. Tasks have their own transcript and exact
  turn/gate controls; background responses must not replace navigation or newer drafts.
- My system is a flat operational view. Saved workflows list newest-created first;
  editing or running an older configuration does not reorder it. Activity keeps history.
- Content generation selects the next eligible chronological plan item unless explicitly
  overridden. Preserve editorial judgment: already-covered or weakly evidenced ideas need
  not produce another article. Keep source evidence separate from publishable copy.
- Style capture requests permission for useful samples in one concise conversation,
  including optional blog writing, notes and selected session excerpts. Do not silently
  scrape personal histories or treat brief chat messages as an approved personal voice.
- Review is pinned eligibility, not a blanket gate. Feedback revises the same document;
  approval binds the current version. Retries cannot reopen an already-approved review.
- Markdown readers remain generic and content-only. Generation notes are separate files
  linked in product context, never inserted into article copy. Raw files are untrusted;
  preserve safe download, sandbox and preview behavior.
- Approved GitHub delivery creates an unmerged PR through the selected integration.
  Without GitHub, approved Markdown remains in Files. Approval is not website publication.
  Email-send approval, recipients and pacing are a separate contract.

## Verification and contributions

- Start with focused tests; use CI for the full suite. Never use production credentials
  or a customer workflow as an implicit test. See CONTRIBUTING.md for exact commands.
- Preserve identifier-only Temporal replay fixtures. Sanitize operational metadata without
  changing workflow commands or deleting replay coverage merely to make checks pass.
- Keep third-party licenses and notices. Bundled fonts are redistributable Geist and
  Montserrat; proprietary fonts belong in a separately licensed operator service.
- No credentials, customer exports, private screenshots, session histories, internal
  acceptance logs or old private Git bundles belong in the source or package.
- External PRs require passing checks and a Tin maintainer review. The named in-house
  maintainer exception permits own-PR merges; it is not a bypass for unreviewed outside work.
- Clean-clone self-hosting acceptance remains deferred. Distinguish fixture tests, real
  provider acceptance and production deployment; do not call the installer turnkey.
