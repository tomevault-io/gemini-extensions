# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

Harness Desktop — a Flutter app that lists Harness machines and attaches xterm terminals to the
agents running on them. **macOS and Linux (Ubuntu) are both real, released targets** — first-run
provisioning (`lib/bootstrap/environment_provisioner.dart`), self-update
(`lib/update/desktop_updater.dart`), and packaging (`scripts/upload-desktop.sh` /
`scripts/upload-desktop-linux.sh`, see RELEASE.md) all branch per-OS internally rather than being
separate code paths. The Windows runner exists but is unexercised. Package name is `harness`
(`import 'package:harness/...'`). It lives under `desktop/` in the `autonomous-harness` repo, beside
the CLI (`../cli`) and the backend (`../backend`); a few comments still point at `autonomous-code`,
the older backend checkout, which is a sibling of this repo rather than part of it.

**Grid was removed on 2026-09-11, when the project was killed**: no `lib/grid/`, no `lib/share/`, no
Settings ▸ Providers or Share Intelligence, no provider pill, model picker, node dashboard or
usage-limit card, and first-run setup no longer installs the Grid CLI. The last commit that still
has all of it is the `archive/grid` branch — bring anything back from there rather than rewriting
it from memory. The harness CLI (`autonomous-harness`) still carries its own grid code
(`gridLaunch.ts`, `gridWebMcp.ts`, `agent_retarget`, `harness grid login`); nothing here calls it.

## Toolchain and commands

`pubspec.yaml` pins `sdk: ^3.13.0`, i.e. **Flutter ≥ 3.47 / Dart ≥ 3.13**. An older Flutter fails at
`flutter pub get` ("version solving failed") and every command below fails with it — check
`flutter --version` first.

The macOS project is migrated to **Swift Package Manager** (`macos/Runner.xcodeproj` references
`FlutterGeneratedPluginSwiftPackage`). Run `flutter config --enable-swift-package-manager` once, then
`flutter pub get` — the generated `macos/Flutter/ephemeral/Packages/FlutterGeneratedPluginSwiftPackage/Package.swift`
only lists the plugin dependencies when SPM is on at `pub get` time. With SPM off, `flutter run` falls
back to CocoaPods and rewrites tracked files (`project.pbxproj`, `contents.xcworkspacedata`, the
`Flutter-*.xcconfig`s) and adds `macos/Podfile`; revert those rather than committing them.

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter analyze                                   # lints: package:flutter_lints, no custom rules
flutter test                                      # whole unit/widget suite (test/)
flutter test test/terminal_session_test.dart      # one file
flutter test test/ws_conn_test.dart --plain-name "reconnects"   # one test by name substring
flutter run -d macos                              # or: flutter run -d linux
bash scripts/build-macos-debug.sh                  # pins the host's release renderer
flutter build macos --release
flutter build linux --release                     # Ubuntu build host only — no cross-compiling
```

Native integration fixtures need a device and the test-mode environment:

```bash
FLUTTER_TEST=1 flutter test -d macos --no-pub integration_test/native_terminal_e2e_test.dart
FLUTTER_TEST=1 flutter test -d macos --no-pub integration_test/native_workspace_e2e_test.dart
```

Both use in-memory state and fake terminal traffic; the workspace fixture also simulates agent
creation and machine-link responses. They refuse to run without `FLUTTER_TEST=1`, which disables
production-only pollers and persistence. The workspace fixture exercises the native macOS titlebar; its injected
Flutter keys do not establish physical AppKit keyboard/IME behavior. A fixture build replaces
`Harness.app`, so rebuild the normal review artifact afterward with
`bash scripts/build-macos-debug.sh --no-pub --target lib/main.dart`.

**Local macOS renderer:** Intel review builds need Skia, just like the Intel release.
Plain `flutter build macos --debug` leaves Impeller enabled and can produce invisible
bitmap artwork on Intel. The script above pins the built bundle's renderer and re-signs
it so Finder launches work too; Apple Silicon keeps Impeller. For `flutter run` and
native integration tests on Intel, add `--no-enable-impeller`. Check companion artwork
on the real renderer with `integration_test/companion_art_native_test.dart`; headless
image tests alone do not catch this failure.

Local stack / E2E scripts (the CLI comes from this repo's `../cli`; the backend from a sibling
`autonomous-code` checkout next to `autonomous-harness` — override with `AUTONOMOUS_CODE_ROOT` /
`HARNESS_REPO_ROOT`; see README):

```bash
make terminal-local-manual   # boots backend+CLI locally and runs lib/main_local_manual.dart
make terminal-local-e2e
make terminal-prod-e2e       # opt-in, refuses without PROD_TERMINAL_E2E=1 + release evidence vars
```

Release (`make release-desktop` from the repo root, which tags `vX.Y.Z_desktop` and lets CI build; `make upload-desktop VERSION=…` and
`make upload-desktop-linux` are the by-hand escape hatches, the latter on an Ubuntu host only) is
documented in RELEASE.md. **macOS ships TWO builds of one universal app**, differing only in
`FLTEnableImpeller`: Intel on Skia under the old `desktop-macos` key (which every older install and the
website download also read), Apple Silicon on Impeller under `desktop-macos-arm64`, both built by
`scripts/publish-macos-variant.sh` — RELEASE.md, "Two macOS builds", has the why. An **internal**
build for testers — both macOS builds, signed and notarized by CI, behind an unlisted link, with
self-update off — is `git push origin HEAD:internal/<name>` (`../.github/workflows/desktop-internal-build.yml`,
RELEASE.md "Internal builds"); never cut one by hand. The run prints the links, and **this repository
is public**, run pages included — so they are unlisted, not private. All platforms
publish to the same GCS `metadata.json` under different keys and share one version
number by default; `pubspec.yaml`'s `version:` is a placeholder and is never bumped — Linux instead
gets a `version.txt` written into the built bundle at package time (see `lib/core/app_version.dart`,
since `flutter build linux` has no Info.plist-style stamping). Test the updater against a scratch
manifest with `--dart-define=DESKTOP_UPDATE_METADATA_URL=...`; `HARNESS_RUNTIME_METADATA_URL` does
the same for the desktop updater only. The managed Node runtime is still published from this repo with
`make upload-node-runtime ARGS=22.23.2` (`darwin-arm64`, `darwin-x64`, `linux-x64`, `linux-arm64`) — and,
since 2026-09-15, a managed **tmux** for macOS the same way (`release-tmux-runtime.yml` /
`make upload-tmux-runtime`, RELEASE.md "Managed tmux runtime") — but
its consumer is now the `harness` installer rather than this app.

## Architecture

### One Flutter UI, native and browser transports

`lib/main.dart` serves both targets; its signed-in workspace is a conditional import
(`desktop_workspace.dart`, or `web/web_entry.dart` when `dart.library.js_interop`), so the
web build **is mouse-first** (product decision, 2026-09-29): every action
desktop keeps in native menus or chords must be clickable. Keys keep working but are not
advertised. Browser-only UI lives in `lib/web/` and is never imported by desktop code;
it plugs into shared screens through additive seams whose default is today's desktop
behavior (e.g. `SwarmScreen.chrome` / `WorkspaceChrome` in `state/workspace_chrome.dart`,
which runs the same `_commands` table keys use, adds a bar over the picker, and turns off
`KeyHints` — `widgets/key_hints.dart`, absent means hints shown). Below
`WorkspaceChrome.compactBelow` (web: 720px, a phone) the workspace goes compact: a tab
switcher replaces the tab row and `PaneGrid.soloFocused` draws only the focused harness —
without touching zoom or the synced layout, so the same desk keeps its grid on a computer. Do not change desktop behavior for the
web, and do not copy shared screens into `lib/web/` — add a seam instead.

`kViewerMode` is true on the web:
the browser owns its OAuth session, peer links, and end-to-end relay encryption.
`viewer/browser_login.dart` validates the same-tab callback against the backend's
PKCE transaction; conditional adapters handle storage and native-only services.
`platform_auth_web.dart` serializes shared login/refresh/logout with Web Locks
and reloads other tabs when the account changes. Auth and E2EE keys persist in
origin-local storage; only the OAuth transaction is in session storage.
Shared sessions use `ObserverRelayCodec` and `/api/observer-ws`, verifying the
owner and permitting only observation and authenticated comments. `/s/:id#key=…`
opens `SharedAgentPage` without restoring the visitor's workspace. Public links
allow anonymous viewing; private links require an invited account. Preserve the
fragment identity pin through sign-in and reload: `startHarness` disables Flutter
hash routing, while the sign-in adapter owns the callback and return URL.
The owner daemon stores comments and enforces link/invitation access on every
request. Reuse `ShareHarnessDialog` and `HarnessComments` for both app targets.
See [README.md](README.md#web-development) for origin setup, browser storage
lifetime, capability limits, and Chrome checks. Browser tests must set
`--dart-define=HARNESS_TEST=true` so no production pollers run.

### Native desktop talks to the local `harness` CLI

The native desktop target uses the CLI for cloud access and SSO tokens:

- **Auth** lives in the CLI. `lib/auth/cli_login.dart` shells out to `harness auth status --json` and
  drives `harness login --json` (NDJSON event stream); `cli_link.dart` wraps `harness link create/import/list`.
  Sign-out owns its CLI process, checks its exit, and terminates it on timeout. `AppNotifier` joins
  repeated sign-out requests and blocks another sign-in until credential and connection cleanup
  finish; failure offers keyboard-focused Retry sign out. Development fixture disconnects never
  sign out the real CLI. Viewer builds use `viewer/direct_login.dart` and `viewer/direct_auth.dart`
  instead: login attempts and token refreshes have session revisions, credential writes are
  serialized, and cancelled or superseded responses cannot restore or clear another account.
  Sign-out and runtime expiry clear live panes, inventory, and history without saving an empty
  layout over the user's desk. Sign-in waits for old transports to close, then restores the saved
  tabs, focus, pins, zoom, and layouts. Every layout read checks both account and layout revisions.
- **REST** (`lib/api/api_client.dart`, Dio) goes to `AppConfig.localCliBaseUrl` (`http://127.0.0.1:18473`),
  and the CLI proxies to the backend with its own session. Responses are `{success, data|error}` and
  unwrapped into `ApiException`.
  Machine responses carry their own cache freshness (`MachineInventory`). Sharing fallback is
  cleared on account changes; only the latest request can publish inventory or clear its error.
  `refreshMachines()` returns whether its result was applied, and retry uses that public path.
  `machineInventoryLoaded` distinguishes an initial wait from a completed inventory with no row
  for a restored pane. Missing, cached, and failed inventories give distinct recovery guidance;
  Retry stays mounted and joins any pending retry, preserving its keyboard focus and position.
  Agent discovery and terminal capabilities also belong to a machine's current connection
  revision. Disconnect/reconnect releases obsolete discovery and recovery futures immediately;
  late replies and timeouts cannot overwrite the replacement connection. Reconnect releases old
  terminal stream IDs while retaining their renderer and output until the new keyframe arrives.
- **WebSocket** (`lib/ws/`) — `WsPool` owns one `WsConn` per machine. Every real connection uses
  `WsTransportKind.localPlaintext` against the CLI daemon's loopback WS (discovered/started by
  `LocalCliDiscovery`, which runs `harness start` when needed). The CLI terminates E2EE for relayed
  machines; the app carries no crypto. Close code `4404`/`NO_PEER_LINK` means the machine needs
  `harness link import` — surfaced as `MachineState.needsLink` and polled via `_linkRetryTimers`.
- **Both REST and the local WS prefer the daemon's Unix socket** (`lib/ws/local_daemon_transport.dart`;
  CLI `lib/localSocket.ts`): `~/.harness/cli/data/daemon-<port>.sock`, 0600, named for the port in
  `localCliBaseUrl` so it always leads to the same daemon as the TCP fallback. The loopback port takes
  any local user's process; the socket only this user's. One `LocalDaemonTransport`, owned by
  `LocalCliDiscovery`, is shared by `ApiClient` (a Dio adapter that only routes the daemon's own
  address) and `WsPool`/`WsConn`. Discovery probes the socket first and the port second; a request or
  dial that cannot reach the socket retries on the port, and each WS connect re-checks whether the
  socket file exists, so a daemon restart does not strand the app on TCP. Windows and paths over 96
  bytes have no socket. The CLI, engine hooks and the dashboard stay on TCP. Under `flutter test`
  `LocalDaemonTransport.detect` finds no socket, so tests never reach a real daemon.
- Besides viewer builds, a direct-to-backend test path is `LocalManualFixture` (`lib/main_local_manual.dart`), a
  compile-time-gated dev entrypoint fed by `scripts/start-terminal-local-manual.sh`. It fails closed
  unless every `--dart-define` is present.

`lib/core/harness_cli_runner.dart` is how the app finds the CLI without a shell: prefer
`~/.harness/runtime/current-node` + `~/.harness/cli/cli.js`, then `~/.local/bin/harness`, then PATH.
`lib/bootstrap/environment_provisioner.dart` installs the CLI and tmux (plus, on Linux, the clipboard
helper) on first run (the `preparingEnvironment` status).

Node is deliberately not the user's: it is a private, sha256-verified runtime under
`~/.harness/runtime`, never Homebrew, nvm or PATH. **The app does not install it — `install.sh` does**,
on its own or on the app's behalf, and records it in `current-node`; the launcher it writes names that
binary absolutely, so a Finder launch (PATH is launchd's bare `/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin`) and a
Terminal launch behave identically. One implementation, shared with everyone who installs the CLI from
a terminal, instead of a second copy here that had to keep its own pinned checksums in step.
**tmux** on Linux is the one dependency still taken from the OS package manager, and the only reason
the setup screen ever opens a terminal: `apt-get install` needs a password prompt on a real tty. On
macOS it is a managed runtime (or the Homebrew one, if Homebrew is already there) and needs neither.

**Readiness is the list of commands the app runs, nothing more** (`EnvironmentStep`: tmux — plus `ps`
on Linux — the Harness CLI, and on a Linux desktop the clipboard helper). Homebrew, the Apple developer
tools, apt and the curl/tar/sed/awk/sha256sum the CLI installer downloads Node with are *recipes* for a
missing command, kept in `EnvironmentReadiness.plan` and probed top-down only while the command is
missing: a Mac with tmux is never asked about Homebrew, and a Linux box with a managed runtime never
about curl. The ladder itself is implemented once, in `cli/scripts/install.sh` (`--host` runs just
that half): on macOS tmux comes from the Homebrew already present or, failing that, the managed
build downloaded into `~/.harness/runtime` — no compiler, no package manager, no password, so the
app runs `--host` in-app and never opens a Terminal window there. Linux keeps the app's own apt
transaction (its clock-skew repair) and the one Terminal handoff. Gating readiness on the recipes
was what sent a computer whose tmux ran fine into Terminal to reinstall developer tools after a macOS
upgrade — the screen renders `plan`, it does not infer one.

Installer-log polling reads only the last 64 KiB and keeps at most 200 lines, tolerating partial
UTF-8 output. Truncated diagnostics include the full log path; the original file remains intact.
A missing, unreadable, or partial Terminal result stays pending until a complete exit code or
successful live probes establish the outcome. Copy failures in setup remain visible beside Retry,
and only the latest clipboard attempt can update its feedback. The setup render fixture checks
both themes and enlarged text at the minimum window size without running an installer.

Read-only dependency probes own their subprocesses and have a ten-second deadline covering startup,
exit, and output-pipe closure. A timeout reports a failed check, not a missing tool; Retry after the
initial check stays read-only. Only an explicit install action permits automatic installation to
continue after a Terminal handoff, and a failed recheck stops that continuation. Readiness requires
the final ready phase and every required step, so old successful step values cannot flash a ready
screen during a new verification. The preflight status is a live region and uses a static waiting
icon when Reduce Motion is enabled.

### Boot and state

`lib/main.dart`: `CrashLog.install()` → `loadPersistedSettings()` (theme mode + terminal font, awaited
before the first frame to avoid flicker) → `RootShell`, which switches on `AppStatus`
(`bootstrapping → preparingEnvironment → unauthenticated → authenticated`).

`lib/state/app_state.dart` (`AppNotifier`, a `ChangeNotifier` exposed through the single Riverpod
`appStateProvider`) is the whole app model: machines, agents, connections, panes, updater, login.
Widgets receive `notifier` explicitly and rebuild via `ListenableBuilder`; Riverpod is only the
injection point (`main_local_manual.dart` overrides it). `bootstrap()` → `_prepareEnvironment()` →
`cliLogin.checkStatus()` → `_finishBootstrapSignedIn()` (restore pane layout, create `WsPool`, ensure
the daemon, `api.me()`, `refreshMachines()`).

Experimental switches are account state. `AppNotifier.experimentalFeatures` binds after `api.me()`
identifies the account, clears on sign-out/account change, and rejects stale responses. It uses
`/api/experimental-settings`, refreshes on account invalidations and a 30-second fallback poll, and
shows changes only after server acknowledgement. Do not restore the old unscoped local keys at startup.
Swarm collaboration keeps its existing account settings RPC. The creature switch opens the account's
`ZooController` collection; disabling it hides the creature without deleting eggs, individuals or progress.
Window-only preview collections are test/render fixtures, not a user setting.

Per-machine runtime state is `MachineState` (connection status, transport mode, agents, `nodeOnline`
from `node_status` pushes — distinct from our own socket status, pending offline agent, turn activity).

### Command dock

For app UI outside terminal panes, follow the [desktop design system](design/desktop-design-system.md).
The terminal-only presentation rules are retired for desktop forms, pickers, and menus.
Preserve [workspace boundaries](design/terminal-workspace.md) and
[dialog behavior](design/terminal-dialogs.md). Cmd-N and New Tab share their composer.

`SwarmSearchController` owns search and selection; `SwarmSearchResults` keeps a bounded cache of
visible/recent row controls. Query-dependent match text listens separately, so typing does not
rebuild unchanged row controls and arrows rebuild only changed highlights. The cache still
invalidates for row metadata, availability, action, geometry, theme, and font changes. Keep focus,
semantics, and traversal on the row; do not replace them with paint-only search results.
Creation and draft precedence are documented in `design/new-harness-entry-rules.md` and exercised
by its listed tests. Cmd-T/Cmd-O retarget the same draft/search; Store requests own their explicit
product and machine. `test/benchmarks/swarm_benchmark.dart` measures large synthetic inventories;
its headless debug timings do not establish native display or network latency.

### Terminals

- `TerminalPane` (`lib/state/terminal_pane.dart`) separates **intent** (machine + agent id, stable
  `id` used as the widget key) from the live `TerminalSession`, so a tile can exist before its machine
  answers and survive the machine going offline. `PaneLayoutStore` persists intent only, max 4 panes;
  `PaneGrid` renders fixed 1–4 tile shapes (deliberately not a splittable tree).
- `TerminalSession` (`lib/terminal/terminal_session.dart`, protocol v3) owns one `xterm` `Terminal`
  for one agent: `terminal_open`/`terminal_ready` handshake matched by requestId+agentId, seq-tracked
  output with bounded resync and one auto-reopen, batched input/resize, heartbeat, and
  `onOpenStalled` to force a transport redial. `engineId == 'grok'` scrolls via tmux copy-mode instead
  of mouse reports (see `scrollViaTmuxCopyMode`).
- Bulk terminal bytes are binary WS frames framed by `lib/terminal/terminal_binary.dart`
  (`HTRL` magic, kinds input/output/keyframe/sync, zlib flag). `AppNotifier._handleTerminalBinary`
  decodes once and offers the frame to **every** session on that machine; each session drops frames
  whose `streamId` is not its own. The same fan-out applies to JSON events in `_handleEvent`: all pane
  sessions get `handleFrame` first (a session returns true for any terminal frame, even one not
  addressed to it), then the app-level switch handles `node_status`, `agent_*`, `turn_*`, and the
  hardware-dial events `dial_scroll`/`dial_focus`.
- **A pane's colours are told to the daemon** (`theme_set`, `AppNotifier._announceTerminalTheme`, on
  every connect and whenever `grid.AppTheme.palette` or `terminalThemeStore` changes; CLI side
  `lib/hostTheme.ts`). tmux answers a TUI's `OSC 10;?`/`OSC 11;?` — which is how Codex picks a light
  or dark diff palette, once, at startup — from whichever client attached to the session FIRST, so a
  person who `tmux attach`ed a light terminal before the daemon's control client made Codex draw
  pale-green diff rows with dark text inside a dark pane. tmux's `window-style` wins over every
  client in that reply and changes nothing a control-mode client receives, so the daemon sets it,
  window-scoped, on the sessions it created (`TmuxBackend.create` chains it into `new-session`;
  `inventory()` restyles existing panes on each scan). ⚠️ `theme_set`/`theme_set_result` are in the
  E2EE type sets in `cli/src/lib/e2ee/core.ts`, which re-pinned the interop keystone; a daemon
  that predates the type goes silent, which the app treats as "not supported" — never an error.
- `third_party/xterm` is a **vendored, patched** xterm 4.0.0 (atomic `replaceRange` fix for scroll
  regions — see its `README.autonomous.md`). Do not replace it with the pub package; the regression
  lives in `test/terminal_session_test.dart`.

### Theming — two files, one source of truth

- `lib/shared/theme/app_theme.dart` (imported as `grid`) is the design-system token layer:
  `AppPalette`/`AppSurface`/... members are **getters** that resolve against the global
  `grid.AppTheme.brightness`, which `_GridTokenScope` in `main.dart` sets from `Theme.of(context)`.
  Chrome widgets call `grid.AppTheme.watch(context)` at the top of `build` so `const` subtrees still
  repaint on a theme flip.
- The [workspace status bar](design/workspace-status-bar.md) places system-font tabs and global actions at the top,
  with subscription usage remaining at the bottom left and focused machine/repo/branch/PR at the bottom right.
  Tabs center their name/status group without permanent number prefixes; Command replaces
  the status with the resolved shortcut beside the name. Tab and pane close marks are small
  and quiet, with larger click targets. Each pane ends with model, split down,
  split right, zoom, close. Split opens New Harness directly for the clicked pane.
  Usage has no dot separators and colors only low/exhausted
  percentages. Automatic names use the strongest shared harness type,
  project, or machine, preferring traits that distinguish tabs and excluding dependent viewers.
  The context follows a viewer's owner and uses the compact project label, never a worktree path
  or marker. User-renamed tabs always retain their saved name. Customize Harness → Status
  selects shell-inspired text or Powerline themes; the focused PR label uses that same theme.
  The single focused PR reader is `state/workspace_pull_request.dart`.
- `lib/theme/app_theme.dart` (`AppColors`, `AppTheme.terminalLight/terminalDark`) is a set of
  adapters over those tokens. Nothing here is `const` on purpose — freezing a colour is how light mode
  silently breaks. Do not add a parallel palette.
- **Type** is `AppType` (`lib/shared/theme/app_type.dart`): system sans for app
  headings, labels, fields, navigation, and prose; explicit mono for code, paths,
  logs, and identifiers. Ordinary UI is independent of terminal zoom and respects
  accessibility text scaling. The terminal grid, in-pane composer, and in-pane
  find keep the selected terminal font and size. Compact pane/status bars retain
  their established `workspaceBarTextStyle()` and user-selected status themes.
  Native menus use the system menu font. Do not measure desktop UI in terminal cells.
- `ThemeModeStore` and `TerminalFontStore` are `ValueNotifier` singletons (they must resolve above the
  provider scope and before sign-in).

### Persistence and native integration

- All local state is in `HarnessFileStore` (`~/.harness/desktop-app/state.json`, mode 0600, keyed
  strings behind `LocalKeyValueStore`): connection config, skipped update version, theme, font, pane
  layout. `~/.harness/computer-id` is the machine identity shared with the CLI.
- The window is frameless on macOS via `window_manager` (`lib/core/desktop_window.dart`, same size and
  `TitleBarStyle.hidden` as Grid). On macOS the tabs are native, in the title bar beside the traffic
  lights (`SwarmTitlebar.swift`); the pane headers are a `DragToMoveArea`. A screen that
  fills the window goes through `FullWindowScreen` (`lib/widgets/window_chrome.dart`) for its drag
  strip, and a full-width band at the top edge pads by `trafficLightClearance`.
- `macos/Runner/MainFlutterWindow.swift` installs native menu items and calls into Dart over the
  `harness/app_menu` MethodChannel (`checkForUpdates`, `flashFirmware`, `showShortcuts`, terminal font
  size). Keep the menu in Swift; only the handler lives in `RootShell`.
- **Agent-account usage is what the native Models menu reads** (`lib/usage/`,
  `usage/models_menu_controller.dart`, `SwarmSubscriptionView` in `SwarmTitlebar.swift`): what the
  Claude and Codex accounts on this machine — and on the remote machines that answer `usage_read` —
  have spent. Each account shows its `tightest` window, the limit that stops the work first.
  The shared controller reads ahead at startup and every five minutes; opening a menu requests
  a fresh reading, capped at once per minute. The footer uses these same deduplicated accounts
  and freshness rules, displaying the remaining percentage rather than the amount spent.
  **Remote machines' accounts arrive through `usage_read`** (`AppNotifier.readRemoteUsage`,
  `usage/remote_usage.dart`, `usage/usage_accounts.dart`; CLI side `cli/src/lib/accountUsage.ts`).
  A remote machine may be signed in to a DIFFERENT subscription, and the only honest way to read
  that one is to ask the machine holding it — so its CLI calls the vendors with ITS OWN token and
  hands back their HTTP status and body untouched, and this app reads them with the SAME
  `claudeUsageFromAnswer`/`codexUsageFromAnswer` it reads its own with. The credential never
  crosses the relay, and the window-naming rules live in one language. Readings are grouped ONE
  PER ACCOUNT (`groupUsageAccounts`): an account key — the first 16 hex of
  sha256(`<provider>:<id>`), `usageAccountKey` here and `accountKey` there, both suites pinning one
  vector — decides whether a remote subscription is this one again (folded in, unlabelled) or
  another (its own figure, labelled with the machine). Hashed because RPC replies are logged.
  ⚠️ A null key never matches, itself included, and a remote reading folds into this computer's
  only when this computer HAS figures — otherwise a token that expired here would swallow a live
  reading of the same account taken there. `readings` stays this computer's alone and `accounts`
  is the grouped view. ⚠️ **`usage_read` is in the E2EE type sets** (`core.ts`),
  which re-pinned the interop keystone the browser client and the paired device share. And a
  remote CLI that predates it does not refuse the frame — it cannot open the envelope, loses the
  requestId and goes silent — so this asks with a 10s timeout and treats every failure as nothing
  to add, never holding up this computer's own figures.
  **This is the one exception to "the app talks only to the local CLI"**, and a narrow one: nothing
  here is dialled on the app's own behalf. `UsageCredentials` reads the tokens
  the agent CLIs already wrote — the macOS Keychain item `Claude Code-credentials` (falling back to
  `~/.claude/.credentials.json`, which is all Linux has) and `~/.codex/auth.json` — and spends them
  against the vendors' own usage endpoints. It never writes or refreshes them: one sign-in per
  machine, owned by the CLI that made it.
  A rate limit is scoped to an **account**, not a machine, so reading it here is right even though
  the agents run elsewhere — provided the remote machines sign in as the same account.
  ⚠️ **Both endpoints are undocumented** — `api.anthropic.com/api/oauth/usage` (needs
  `anthropic-beta: oauth-2025-04-20` and the CLI's own user agent, because the OAuth token was minted
  for the CLI) and `chatgpt.com/backend-api/wham/usage`. Either can change without notice; both
  failures land as a `ProviderUsage` state rather than an exception. **`signedOut` is kept apart from
  `failed`**: retrying a sign-out fails identically forever. Claude's Fable window has been spelled three ways
  across releases and all three are tried; Codex names its windows from `limit_window_seconds` rather
  than assuming, because a confident "5h" beside a real percentage reads as measured.
  `loading` is false **before** `start()` as well as after the first answer — a controller nobody
  started is not waiting for anything, and a skeleton for it would promise an answer never coming.
  That is also what keeps `flutter test` honest: `kUnderTest` (`core/test_run.dart`) stops the
  poll auto-starting, since a `Timer.periodic` is a `pumpAndSettle` that
  never settles and these sources would otherwise shell out to `security` and open real sockets.
- **The token ledger is the OTHER usage feature, and the two must not be merged** (`lib/usage/ledger/`,
  Settings ▸ Usage in `settings/sections/usage_section.dart` + `usage_panels.dart`). The Models menu's
  readout above asks the vendors *how much of your rate limit is left* — a percentage, scoped to an **account**,
  true whichever machine burned it. This counts **tokens**, scoped to **this machine**, with a history:
  it reads the logs the agent CLIs already wrote to this disk and calls nobody. Ported from Orca
  (`src/main/{claude,codex,opencode}-usage/`); keep the pricing tables in step with its
  `claude-model-pricing.ts` / `codex-model-pricing.ts`.
  **Three providers, three unrelated formats.** Claude: JSONL under `~/.claude/projects` *and*
  `~/.claude/transcripts` (the older layout — reading only the first drops every pre-move session),
  usage off `message.usage` on `type == "assistant"` rows. Codex: JSONL under
  `$CODEX_HOME`/`~/.codex/{sessions,archived_sessions}`, usage off `event_msg`/`token_count`. OpenCode:
  a **SQLite** database at `$XDG_DATA_HOME/opencode/opencode*.db`, one aggregate row per session.
  ⚠️ **Codex reports CUMULATIVE totals where Claude reports per-turn figures** — summing
  `total_token_usage` would bill a 40-turn session forty times over, so `resolveCodexDelta` takes the
  increment and guards the compaction/resume regressions. ⚠️ **`UsageTotals.freshInput` is
  cache-EXCLUSIVE for all three**, which costs Codex a subtraction because its `input_tokens` includes
  `cached_input_tokens`; Orca deliberately does *not* normalise, which is right for a scanner that
  round-trips a file format and wrong here, where one panel adds all three together. Codex's
  `cache_write_input_tokens` is dropped on purpose — OpenAI writes its cache free, so a bucket for it
  would show tokens nobody is billed for.
  **`costUsd` is nullable and null is never zero.** Only OpenCode fills it, from its own `cost` column;
  Claude and Codex are priced from `model_pricing.dart`, and a model that matches no row leaves
  `hasUnpricedModel` set so the panel calls the figure a floor. A Grid session records a real `0.0`
  (Grid inference is free, grid ADR 0039 D-g) and that measurement must not render like an unpriced
  model. Same rule as account usage: `LedgerStatus.unavailable` is kept apart from `failed`, because a
  machine with no OpenCode is never fixed by retrying.
  **Off is the resting state**, per provider, persisted through `LocalKeyValueStore`: these transcripts
  hold every prompt, path and branch a session touched and this feature wants only the counts, so
  nothing is read until somebody switches it on — and switching one off deletes its snapshot from disk
  as well as from memory. JSONL scans are incremental against a `{path, mtime, size}` fingerprint cached in
  `~/.harness/desktop-app/usage-ledger-<provider>.json`. OpenCode instead queries a committed SQLite
  snapshot on each scan: the main database's metadata can stay unchanged while its WAL changes.
  SQLite reads run in a worker isolate. `kLedgerStaleAfter` (5 min) keeps opening
  the pane from re-walking the disk; a cold Claude scan is ~3s over 71 transcripts, which is why
  neither of those is optional. Nothing polls — a ledger only moves when an agent writes here.
  An unreadable OpenCode source is failed, not missing. If other databases are readable, the result
  is partial and the UI marks its figures incomplete. Partial results are kept in memory, but never
  restored as a fresh complete snapshot; reopening or Retry rescans them.
  Claude/Codex share the same failure rules in `jsonl_ledger_scan.dart`: a failed read is never cached
  as an empty successful source. Snapshot format 3 discards old snapshots that could contain that
  mistake. Reads stop at the captured file size and tolerate an unfinished UTF-8 suffix while an
  agent appends, preserving earlier complete records; completed corrupt text remains an error.
  Model-name normalization has a small bounded cache, while per-turn token/tier pricing stays dynamic.
  ⚠️ **Local only, by decision.** Agents launched onto remote machines write their transcripts there and
  nothing here reaches them; the pane's subtitle says so, because a total that silently excluded most of
  a team's work would be worse than no total. `UsageSource` in `usage/usage_source.dart` is where a
  per-machine source would arrive if that changes.
  `sqlite3` is a **Dart-only FFI** dependency (never `sqlite3_flutter_libs`): it dlopens the system
  library, so it registers no native plugin and leaves the macOS SPM package list alone. `kUnderTest`
  keeps `UsageSection` from auto-loading, for the same reason `UsageController`'s poll does not start there.
  ⚠️ **The snapshot goes through `SnapshotStore` (`core/snapshot_store.dart`), and a test MUST pass
  `MemorySnapshotStore`** — this is not tidiness. A real `File.writeAsString` never completes inside
  `testWidgets`' fake-async zone, so a store awaiting one hangs the whole run until the shell is
  killed rather than failing; that seam is what keeps `dart:io` out of a widget test, exactly as
  `LocalKeyValueStore` does. It is deliberately NOT `LocalKeyValueStore`: that is `state.json`, one
  small locked document, and a multi-megabyte usage snapshot in it would be rewritten on every theme
  flip. `HarnessStats` uses the same seam.
- **Settings ▸ Usage has a second half, and it counts the APP rather than the CLIs**
  (`lib/stats/harness_stats.dart`, drawn by `StatsSummaryCards`). Ported from Orca's
  `src/main/stats/`: agents spawned, time agents worked, and a "Tracking since" line. These are this
  app's own events, so unlike the ledger there is no permission to ask and no switch — an app may
  count what it did. `harnessStats` is a singleton like `appLog`, loaded by
  `loadPersistedSettings` (not for the first frame — because the counters start moving as soon as an
  agent does, and a load landing after the first `onAgentSpawned` would overwrite it) and flushed by
  `StatsLifecycle.didRequestAppExit` (`stats/stats_lifecycle.dart`), which is the ONLY place a turn still running at quit gets
  its time counted.
  Three hooks, all in `AppNotifier`: `createAgent` (**not** the `agent_created` push, which also
  fires for agents another client made on the same machine), the `turn_started` case (**not**
  `turn_heartbeat`, which is a turn already under way), and `_cancelTurnActivity` plus the turn
  watchdog for the end. ⚠️ **The watchdog end is load-bearing**: it is the only close a stalled turn
  ever gets, and a stats turn left open would sit there until quit and then bank every hour since as
  work. A start on a live key is ignored rather than restarting the clock, and an end with no start
  contributes nothing — that is what makes the disconnect sweep safe.
  ⚠️ **Two deliberate departures from Orca.** The third card is TURNS, not PRs created: this app
  opens no pull requests, and a card wired to a number that can only read zero is worse than one
  showing something true. And no event log is kept — Orca persists 10,000 events beside its
  aggregates for breakdowns it does not draw, at ~900KB per write; `firstEventAt` is stored directly,
  which is the one thing that log was protecting.
- **The per-provider detail pane is ONE file, not three** (`settings/sections/usage_provider_pane.dart`
  with `usage_detail_panels.dart`), against Orca's near-identical `ClaudeUsagePane` /
  `CodexUsagePane` / `OpenCodeUsagePane`. Everything that differs between providers is already in
  `usage/ledger/usage_report.dart`; three copies of the layout would be three places to fix a
  spacing bug. The lens picker at the top of Settings ▸ Usage switches between the overview and one
  provider, and `_Lens` is a nullable `LedgerProvider` so the per-provider cases stay exactly the
  providers that exist.
  **The overview opens on the last 30 days**, the window Orca's default range shows, so a figure here
  can be compared against one there — `_kDefaultOverviewRange`. All-time is a click away in the same
  picker the provider panes carry. Measured on one machine: 30 days reads 3.2B tokens / 20 active days
  / 80 sessions, where all-time reads 3.8B / 33 / 92 — both true, answering different questions. The
  intensity grid draws a fixed six weeks whatever the range is, as Orca's does: `overview.days` is
  already clipped, so the days before the window fill in as EMPTY cells rather than as stray data, and
  shrinking the strip to the range only costs it the context a heatmap exists for. Clipping
  happens in `clipLedger` at draw time, not at scan time: the scan is the expensive half and does not
  depend on the window being looked at, and `ledgerFromEntries` is shared with `buildProviderLedger` so
  a clipped ledger cannot sum its cost differently from the full one.
  ⚠️ **There is a RANGE filter and deliberately no SCOPE filter.** Orca offers "Orca worktrees only"
  against "all local usage" because it owns the worktrees its agents run in. This app owns no such
  boundary — agents launched through Harness run on OTHER machines and write their transcripts there
  — so a "Harness only" lens over this computer's logs would filter on a distinction that does not
  exist here and would answer nearly zero. Everything local is counted and the pane says so.
  ⚠️ **OpenCode's `tokens_cache_read` is a PEER of `tokens_input`, not a subset — Orca gets this
  wrong and this app must not copy it.** `opencode-usage-row-parsing.ts` clamps it with
  `Math.min(cache.read, input)` on the assumption it is contained, the way Codex's cached input is.
  Measured against a live database, three of nine sessions read more from cache than they had input at
  all (7,680 cached against 72 input), which no subset can do; the clamp threw away 30.2k of 51.0k real
  cache reads and dropped them from the total besides. OpenCode's schema keeps `tokens_input`,
  `tokens_cache_read` and `tokens_cache_write` as three columns, the Anthropic shape rather than the
  OpenAI one. Codex remains the only provider whose input needs the subtraction.
  ⚠️ **`UsageSessionsTable` states its width instead of stretching.** Inside a horizontal
  `SingleChildScrollView` the incoming width is unbounded, so `CrossAxisAlignment.stretch` asks for
  an infinite row and the layout throws; `_sessionTableWidth` sums the columns, which is the only
  honest width it has.
- Settings is a **screen**, not a dialog (`lib/settings/`): `showSettingsScreen` pushes a faded route
  whose rail lists `settingsGroups` from `settings_section.dart` and whose pane is one widget per
  `SettingsSection` (`sections/`). Adding a setting means adding an enum value, a group entry and a
  section widget — nothing else. Panes are framed by `shared/widgets/section_scaffold.dart` (copied
  from Grid), and one setting inside a pane is a `shared/widgets/setting_row.dart` — a raised block
  with its title and detail on the left and its control, fixed at `SettingRow.controlWidth`, on the
  right. Appearance and Terminal both use it; a pane that invents its own row shape is the bug.
  Controls come from `shared/widgets/` too (`AppSelectField`, `AppIconButton`) — raw Material
  `DropdownButton`/`IconButton` do not match anything else in the app.
- **The log is written to files, and Settings ▸ Debug reads them back** (`lib/logging/`,
  `settings/sections/debug_*.dart`). `appLog` (`app-YYYYMMDD.log`) is the narrative — `app`, `ws`,
  `api`, `flutter` — and `cliLog` (`cli-YYYYMMDD.log`) is a transcript of every child process, both
  ported from Grid and both pruned after 14 days. The CLI chokepoint writes it:
  `HarnessCliRunner.run/start` goes through `logging/cli_transcript.dart`, which logs the command
  **as a person reads it** (`harness auth status --json`, never the managed tier's
  `<node> <cli.js>` argv) and never its environment — a secret handed to a child rides there
  precisely to stay out of argv. The Dio clients carry `attachHttpLog`, one `api` line per finished request, method and
  URL only. **What a child PRINTS can still be a credential**, so CLI output and URLs go through
  `redactSecretsInText` (`logging/redact.dart`, beside the frame-level `redactValue`) before
  anything is written. The Debug pane is a **mirror** of those sinks, not a second stream
  (`log_stream.dart` + `log_stream_sinks.dart`): a bounded ring of the last 500 entries that
  `installFileLogs` tees into, so a line on screen is a line the file already has. It is developer
  furniture — `kDebugSurfaceEnabled` (`logging/debug_surface.dart`, `kDebugMode` or
  `--dart-define=HARNESS_DEBUG_SURFACE=true`) gates the rail row, the ⌘D shortcut
  (`kDebugShortcut`, in `appShortcuts()` rather than `kAppShortcuts`) and the ring itself; the log
  FILES are written either way, because a shipped app with no stderr is exactly the one whose logs
  matter.
- **A screen that waits on a call waits in the shape of its answer.** `shared/widgets/skeleton.dart`
  (`Skeleton`, `SkeletonText`, `SkeletonLine`, `SkeletonList`, `SkeletonBlock`) draws placeholders and
  `shared/widgets/pulse.dart` owns the app's one loading rhythm — an opacity breath between
  `AppSurface.recess` and `recessHover`, never a shimmer sweep, frozen at the **peak** under Reduce
  Motion because a block held at 40% reads as disabled. A spinner is still right where the shape is
  genuinely unknown (boot, a button mid-action); a list, table, card, row or figure gets a skeleton.
  Three rules the call sites keep, guarded by `test/skeleton_test.dart`: a placeholder is measured from the real content (`SkeletonText`
  lays out the style with a `TextPainter` rather than trusting arithmetic — see `AppMenuRowMetrics`
  for why), it wears the real row's surface and padding, and it is never **taller** than the answer
  usually is, since a skeleton that shrinks jumps the page upward. **"Loading" and "answered with
  nothing" must not render the same** — hence `AppNotifier.machinesLoading`, which is set on the
  first fetch only so a refresh keeps the rows already on screen.
- `lib/shortcuts/app_shortcuts.dart` and `keymap_commands.dart` supply the live shortcut catalog.
  `shortcuts/shortcuts_browser.dart` shares searchable, grouped rows between the ⌘/ dialog and
  Settings ▸ Keyboard shortcuts. It reads resolved bindings through `keyboardLessons()`, so remaps
  appear immediately; clicking a row or pressing Enter opens keyboard practice without dispatching
  that action. Labels and keycaps use system UI typography and accessibility text scaling,
  independent of terminal font and zoom. The practice scratch preview retains terminal typography.
  ⇧⌘P opens commands with the query `>`; ⌘P opens the unified picker. On Linux these use
  Ctrl+Shift+P and Alt+Shift+P. Linux, like the web, takes Alt where the Mac takes ⌘
  (`altWorkspacePrefix`) — Hyprland and GNOME keep most Super chords for themselves — and
  `_linuxAltShortcuts`/`linuxAltCommandKeys` move the few that would land on a key a terminal
  program answers (Alt+Enter, Alt+T, Alt+F/B/D). The runner rewrites Super to Meta
  (`super_as_meta_cb`), so a Super chord a user binds still reads as `cmd`.
  Other workspace shortcuts are ⌘-based — Ctrl otherwise belongs to the shell/tmux, ⌥ is a
  Meta prefix for the pty (⌥⏎ and ⌥⌫ only — `AltAsMetaInputHandler` in
  `lib/terminal/terminal_input.dart` turns them into `ESC` + Return and `ESC` + `\x7f`, so the
  engine's prompt breaks the line instead of submitting and kills the word behind the cursor
  instead of hearing nothing; ⌥ stays the compose key everywhere else), and ⌘C/⌘V/⌘A are owned by
  xterm — with two pinned exceptions: `⌃⇥`/`⌃⇧⇥` for the panes, which the terminal is made to let
  past, and ⌘⌫, which `TerminalPanel._onTerminalKey` takes back off the app and sends to the pty as
  `^U` because a ⌘ chord never reaches xterm's input handler at all. The composer answers all four
  line-editing chords too: it writes ⌥⏎'s newline itself, binds `^W`/`^U`, and lets Flutter's own
  macOS text-editing shortcuts serve ⌥⌫ and ⌘⌫.
- `lib/flash/` flashes the ESP32-S3 dial through the CLI runner; `SerialPortLease` pauses daemon
  supervision while the port is held so `harness start` cannot steal it mid-write.
- `lib/update/desktop_updater.dart` self-updates from the GCS manifest (sha256-verified, strictly
  newer only). Its keys must match what writes the manifest — `_otaKeyMacOS`/`_otaKeyMacOSArm64` the
  variant table in `scripts/publish-macos-variant.sh`, `desktop-linux-<arch>` the `OTA_KEY` in
  `scripts/upload-desktop-linux.sh`. An Intel Mac reads only `desktop-macos` (the Skia build); Apple
  Silicon takes the newer of `desktop-macos-arm64` and `desktop-macos`, arm64 winning a tie.

## Testing conventions

Unit tests build `AppNotifier(config: AppConfig.dev, authSession: AuthSession(), configStore: null)`
and set `status` directly, or pass subclass fakes (`CliLogin`, `EnvironmentProvisioner`, `ConfigStore`)
so nothing shells out to a real `harness` binary. Stores (`PaneLayoutStore`, `ThemeModeStore`,
`TerminalFontStore`) take an in-memory `LocalKeyValueStore` implementation instead of touching
`~/.harness`. `TerminalSession` is exercised with recording `send`/`sendBinary` closures and
`handleFrame`/`handleBinary`. Use the `@visibleForTesting` seams on `AppNotifier`
(`handleEventForTest`, `adoptSessionForTest`) rather than reaching into private state.
