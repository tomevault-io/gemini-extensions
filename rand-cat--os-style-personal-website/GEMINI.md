## What This Project Is

This repo is an Astro-based personal website. The home page is not a standard landing page; it behaves like a small desktop OS with draggable windows, desktop icons, a blog app, and supporting app-like panels.

The project has two equally important parts:

- a desktop-style shell on `/`
- a conventional content-backed blog system under `/blog`

When making changes, treat the desktop interactions as product behavior, not decorative chrome.

## Stack

- Framework: Astro
- Content: Astro Content Collections
- Main content source: `src/content/blog`
- Client behavior: browser JavaScript loaded from `public/scripts`
- Styling: CSS loaded from `public/styles`

Useful commands:

- `npm run dev`
- `npm run build`
- `npm run preview`
- `npm run import:jike -- "/absolute/path/to/export.csv"`
- `npm run jike:translate:worklist -- --limit 20`

## First Places To Read

If you are new to the repo, start here:

1. `src/pages/index.astro`
   The main desktop-style home page. This is the integration point for the OS UI.
2. `src/data/desktop.ts`
   Desktop app metadata, icon labels, group previews, window sizes, desktop icon positions, and external links.
3. `src/components/desktop/WindowFrame.astro`
   Shared shell for both standard desktop windows and special group-style overlays.
4. `src/components/desktop/DesktopBlogWindow.astro`
   The main blog application shown inside the desktop.
5. `src/lib/blog.ts`
   Shared blog helpers: locale logic, paths, formatting, and post lookup.

Useful desktop-specific components to inspect immediately:

- `src/components/desktop/DesktopIcons.astro`
- `src/components/desktop/DesktopDock.astro`
- `src/components/desktop/VibaryWindow.astro`
- `src/components/desktop/ProductPlaceholderWindow.astro`
- `src/components/desktop/SocialFolderWindow.astro`
- `src/components/desktop/JikeIdeasWindow.astro`

## Blog Architecture

The blog exists in two forms:

- standard pages under `src/pages/blog/**`
- an embedded reader used inside the desktop window

Important files:

- `src/components/blog/BlogIndexPage.astro`
- `src/components/blog/BlogArticlePage.astro`
- `src/components/blog/BlogEmbedPage.astro`
- `src/content/blog/*`
- `public/scripts/locale-preference.js`

If blog typography, locale switching, or article selection feels wrong, inspect both the desktop blog window and the underlying blog page components.

Current locale behavior:

- Blog routes remain path-based:
  - `/blog` for Chinese
  - `/blog/en` for English
- On first visit, if `localStorage["blog-locale"]` is missing, the client now detects `navigator.languages` and stores either `zh` or `en`.
- After the user manually switches once, the stored locale takes priority over browser language.
- The same stored locale is reused across:
  - desktop blog
  - content-app windows
  - Jike window localized UI
  - desktop cat speech bubble copy

## Desktop Architecture

The home page is assembled from desktop-specific components plus shared window behavior.

Core ideas:

- each app has an id defined in `src/data/desktop.ts`
- the page uses that metadata to render icons and windows
- shared window behavior should stay in the window shell / desktop script layer instead of being duplicated per app

Desktop-related files are mainly under:

- `src/components/desktop/`
- `src/data/desktop.ts`
- `public/styles/desktop-os.css`
- `public/scripts/desktop-os.js`

Desktop CSS and JS are intentionally split into modules now. Keep them split by concern instead of pushing everything back into one file.
If a window/app has custom UI that is not clearly reusable, give it its own CSS file instead of growing `panes.css`.

CSS entry:

- `public/styles/desktop-os.css`

CSS modules:

- `public/styles/desktop/shell.css`
  Page shell, desktop icons, top bar, wallpaper/background treatment, and global desktop states.
- `public/styles/desktop/windows.css`
  Standard window shell, focus states, controls, maximize/fullscreen behavior, and group overlay shells.
- `public/styles/desktop/panes.css`
  Shared pane styles only. Do not keep app-specific window styling here unless it is genuinely reused.
- `public/styles/desktop/dock.css`
  Dock tray, magnification styling, active dots, hover labels, and show/hide behavior.
- `public/styles/desktop/responsive.css`
  Responsive adjustments and small-screen fallbacks.
- `public/styles/desktop/*.css`
  App-specific window styling such as `jike.css`, `studio.css`, `settings.css`, `read-easy.css`, `vibary.css`, and related per-window files.

JS entry:

- `public/scripts/desktop-os.js`

JS modules:

- `public/scripts/locale-preference.js`
  Shared client-side locale preference helpers: first-visit browser-language detection, storage reads/writes, and locale normalization.
- `public/scripts/desktop/window-manager.js`
  Open/close/focus/minimize/maximize, initial window placement, group overlay open/close, drag, and 8-direction resize.
- `public/scripts/desktop/dock.js`
  Dock magnification and slot-width behavior.
- `public/scripts/desktop/blog-browser.js`
  Blog locale switching, embedded article routing, and sidebar behavior.
- `public/scripts/desktop/app-locale.js`
  Locale switching for shared content-app windows and other desktop panes that render parallel zh/en blocks.
- `public/scripts/desktop/clock.js`
  Top bar and desktop clock/date.
- `public/scripts/desktop/jike-archive.js`
  Jike window interactions such as text expand/collapse, locale-aware expansion targeting, and image lightbox behavior.
- `public/scripts/desktop/cat-interaction.js`
  Desktop cat hover copy, app hover phrases, and locale-aware speech bubble behavior.

## Mobile/Tablet Behavior

For widths `<= 980px`, the site switches to a mobile OS model (phone + tablet share the same rules):

- No system bar, no desktop cat, and no desktop drag/resize affordances.
- Apps open full-screen; the page itself does not scroll (only app content scrolls).
- A fixed bottom dock shows exactly 4 apps (not dynamic). Dock magnification and hover labels are disabled.
- The close control is a small circular button styled to match window borders, with a single inner dot.
- Blog uses a mobile flow: list first, then article detail with a back button in the title bar.
- Group overlays (folders) are shown as a square 3x3 grid panel.

Key files for mobile behavior:
- `public/styles/desktop/responsive.css`
- `public/scripts/desktop/window-manager.js`
- `public/scripts/desktop/dock.js`
- `public/scripts/desktop/blog-browser.js`
- `public/styles/desktop/blog-window.css`
- `public/styles/desktop/cat.css`

## Jike Archive Architecture

The `jike` desktop app is a content app backed by generated data from an exported CSV.

Important files:

- `src/components/desktop/JikeIdeasWindow.astro`
- `src/components/desktop/JikeCardContent.astro`
- `src/data/jike.ts`
- `src/data/jike-posts.generated.ts`
- `src/data/jike-translations.ts`
- `public/styles/desktop/jike.css`
- `public/scripts/desktop/jike-archive.js`
- `scripts/import-jike-csv.py`
- `scripts/jike-translation-worklist.mjs`

Notes:

- The generated data file should be treated as derived output, not hand-edited content.
- When the CSV export changes, regenerate the data via `npm run import:jike -- "/absolute/path/to/export.csv"`.
- English support for Jike is still partial and hand-maintained in `src/data/jike-translations.ts`, but there is now a helper workflow for batching translation work.
- Use `npm run jike:translate:worklist -- --limit 20` to list untranslated posts.
- Use `npm run jike:translate:worklist -- --topic "AI探索站" --format markdown` when preparing a translation batch for review or external translation help.
- Use `npm run jike:translate:worklist -- --ids "id1,id2" --format ts` to generate a paste-ready skeleton for `jikePostTranslations`.
- Prefer translating recent, high-signal posts first: product updates, AI explorations, essays with durable value, and posts that are still understandable to English readers outside the original social context.
- The Jike window renders English for translated recent posts and falls back to Chinese per-post when no translation exists; do not replace untranslated cards with blank states.
- Topic names also need explicit entries in `jikeTopicTranslations` when new Chinese categories appear; otherwise English cards will show raw Chinese topic labels.
- If the Jike UI changes, keep its structure, styles, and interactions isolated to the Jike-specific files instead of leaking logic into shared pane files.

## Design Direction

The current visual language is deliberately restrained:

- warm off-white / paper-like surfaces
- serif-led editorial typography
- minimal chrome
- subtle focus states instead of loud color

Avoid introducing glossy consumer-app styling unless the user explicitly asks for a different direction.

## How To Add Or Change Things

### Add a new desktop app

1. Add app metadata to `src/data/desktop.ts`
2. Render the app window from `src/pages/index.astro`
3. Put app-specific UI in `src/components/desktop/`
4. Reuse `WindowFrame.astro` instead of inventing a new shell
5. If the window has bespoke styling or interaction logic, create app-specific files under `public/styles/desktop/` and `public/scripts/desktop/` instead of extending shared files by default

Current app categories:

- standard product / content apps
- pinned dock apps (`dockPinned: true`)
- placeholder product apps that open a generic intro pane
- grouped / folder-like apps such as `social`, which use a special overlay variant instead of a normal titlebar window

### Add a desktop group

The `social` app is the reference implementation.

What makes it different:

- the desktop icon can preview multiple items via `groupMembers`
- it uses `WindowFrame` with `variant="group"`
- opening it creates a full-screen overlay
- clicking outside the inner content closes it
- it is not meant to behave like a draggable/resizable normal window

### Update blog content

1. Edit or add files in `src/content/blog`
2. Check locale pairing and slugs
3. Verify both `/blog` and the embedded desktop blog window still work

### Change interactions

If the change affects:

- window focus / drag / resize / minimize / maximize: start with the desktop script layer and `WindowFrame.astro`
- group / folder-like overlay behavior: start with `WindowFrame.astro`, `window-manager.js`, and the relevant pane component
- dock content rules or magnification: inspect both `DesktopDock.astro` and `public/scripts/desktop/dock.js`
- blog selection or locale switching: inspect both `DesktopBlogWindow.astro` and blog page helpers
- global look and spacing: start from `public/styles/desktop-os.css`

## Current Desktop Rules

These are easy to accidentally break:

- Desktop icon images should fill the rounded rectangle shape with `object-fit: cover`; do not leave inner white padding around provided image icons.
- Favicon assets are PNG/ICO-based now and are generated from `public/icons/pfp.png` into:
  - `public/favicon.png`
  - `public/favicon.ico`
  - `public/apple-touch-icon.png`
  - `public/favicon-32x32.png`
  - `public/favicon-16x16.png`
- The dock should show:
  - pinned apps
  - currently open non-pinned apps
  It should not list every desktop app all the time.
- Standard windows open centered by default, with small offsets if other windows are already open.
- Standard windows support:
  - focus states
  - minimize
  - maximize into a real full-screen-like state
  - resize from 4 edges and 4 corners
- Maximize should hide menu bar and dock, and maximized windows should use an opaque background.
- Group overlays such as `social` should:
  - cover the whole desktop
  - hide or heavily suppress dock/menu/desktop noise behind them
  - open from the icon position with animation
  - close on outside click
- avoid unnecessary extra container layers
- Avoid using opaque color-gradient overlays to fade content in scrollable panes. Prefer `mask-image`-based fades so high-contrast background elements (like the cat illustration) do not show a visible white haze when content aligns with anchors.

## Guardrails

- Keep desktop behavior coherent across apps; do not special-case one window unless necessary.
- Prefer data-driven additions in `src/data/desktop.ts` over hardcoded duplicated markup.
- Preserve the editorial OS feeling unless the request clearly changes the art direction.
- If the user asks for UI refinement, check the actual rendered interaction, not just static markup.
- Prefer app-level decoupling for window interiors. Shared files should stay shared; they should not become catch-all buckets for unrelated app code.

## Verification

At minimum, run:

- `npm run build`

For meaningful desktop UI changes, also manually verify:

- opening and closing windows
- focus state changes
- dragging and resizing
- edge/corner resize behavior
- maximize / restore behavior
- dock behavior if present
- dock icon image cropping
- dock pinned/open visibility rules
- group overlay open / outside-click close
- blog article switching
- locale switching

## Current Intent

This repo is trying to make a personal website feel like a carefully designed desktop environment while still keeping the writing system maintainable.

Optimize for:

- visual consistency
- clear structure
- smooth interaction behavior
- easy handoff for the next agent

## Desktop Content Layout State (2026-03-11)

- Content apps should use the shared `ContentAppWindow.astro` + `/styles/desktop/content-app.css`. This sets a unified hero layout (logo from desktop iconSrc, title, summary, optional link, meta line) and Markdown sizing (h2 26px, h3 19px, body 17px).
- Content apps are now locale-aware. App entries in `src/content/apps/*` may ship as paired `*-en.md` files with `locale: en` and a shared `translationKey`; locale resolution lives in `src/lib/apps.ts`.
- The shared locale renderer for content apps is `src/components/desktop/ContentAppWindow.astro`, and client-side switching is handled by `public/scripts/desktop/app-locale.js`.
- If an app has only a Chinese entry, the desktop should continue showing the Chinese pane even when the global locale is English.
- Avoid per-app typography overrides; do not reintroduce app-specific font/size overrides in shared panes unless absolutely necessary and documented here.
- Reading widths: container 860px max, text column 760px max.
- OneSnap gallery: three columns on desktop, single column under 900px; keep original aspect and size (no downscaling).
- If an app needs bespoke visuals, keep them scoped to unique selectors and do not touch hero/body font sizes set by `content-app.css`.

### Desktop Locale Notes (2026-03-13)

- The desktop top-right `中文 / English` switch controls more than the blog. It also drives:
  - shared content-app windows
  - Jike window translated UI and translated post bodies where available
  - desktop cat speech phrases
- The first visit should honor browser language preference, but only until the user makes an explicit choice. After that, `localStorage["blog-locale"]` is the source of truth.
- For blog index/article pages, keep route locale and stored locale in sync. The standalone pages should not silently render English content at the Chinese path or vice versa.
- The desktop cat speech bubble lives in `public/styles/desktop/cat.css` and currently uses a constrained multi-line bubble width rather than single-line nowrap behavior.

### Mobile hero layout (≤ 560px)

The `ContentAppWindow` hero adapts to a compact Product Hunt-style layout at narrow widths. All rules live in the `@media (max-width: 560px)` block inside `content-app.css`.

Structure at ≤ 560px:

- **Row 1**: App icon (36 px, rounded) + product name, vertically centered with each other.
- **Row 2**: Summary text, spanning the full grid width and left-aligned with the icon.
- **Row 3**: Full-width CTA button (stretches edge-to-edge, 44 px tall, 12 px radius).
- **Below**: Meta line (year · platform · tags), same compact dot-separated style as desktop.

Implementation detail: `.content-app__heroCopy` is set to `display: contents` on mobile so that the `h2` and `p` it wraps participate directly in the parent grid and can be placed on separate rows via explicit `grid-row` / `grid-column` values. Do not remove this or wrap the children in an extra element — it would break the two-row title/summary split.
