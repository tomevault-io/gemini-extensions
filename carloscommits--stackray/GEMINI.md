# This is NOT the Next.js you know

Next.js is pinned to `16.2.10`; APIs and file conventions may differ from training data. Before changing Next-specific behavior, read the relevant guide under `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` and heed deprecations.

# Stackray repo guide

## Runtime and commands

- Use Node `24.x` and `pnpm@10.26.1`; CI enables pnpm with Corepack and installs with `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`.
- CI quality order is `pnpm lint` -> `pnpm typecheck` -> `pnpm test` -> `pnpm test:performance-contracts` -> `pnpm test:railway-template` -> `pnpm build`.
- Focused unit tests: `pnpm vitest run path/to/file.test.ts` (`vitest.config.ts` includes `**/*.test.{ts,tsx}` and uses `jsdom`).
- E2E: `pnpm test:e2e` starts `pnpm db:migrate:startup && pnpm dev --hostname 127.0.0.1 --port ${PLAYWRIGHT_PORT:-3100}` and needs Postgres; set `STACKRAY_E2E_USE_SYSTEM_CHROME=true` to use system Chrome like CI.
- DB-backed smoke tests need Postgres and startup migrations first: `pnpm test:scan-pipeline-smoke` exercises fake scanners plus `http`/`intel`/`browser` workers; `pnpm test:railway-template` validates the Railway service template.
- `pnpm build` runs `next build` and then `scripts/copy-next-standalone-assets.ts`; `pnpm start` always runs `pnpm db:migrate:startup` before `.next/standalone/server.js`.
- `pnpm dev:local` is the default local stack: it creates `.env.local` if missing, chooses per-worktree ports, starts Postgres/MinIO, runs migrations, seeds `admin@stackray.local` / `StackrayDev123!`, then runs host Next.js plus Docker workers.
- `pnpm dev:local:down` stops this worktree's Docker services without deleting volumes; `pnpm dev:local:wipe` deletes local Postgres/MinIO volumes.

## Local environment and services

- `.env.local` takes precedence over `.env`, and setup scripts never overwrite an existing `.env.local`; check it is not pointing at Railway before worker or migration testing.
- Before launching `pnpm dev:local`, `pnpm dev`, or local hands-on QA servers, check tmux for an existing Stackray dev session. In the main `~/projects/stackray` checkout, reuse the existing session if one is running; in a separate worktree, start that worktree's own tmux session with `pnpm dev:local` so it gets isolated ports, Compose project, and volumes.
- Local app runs on the host; Postgres and MinIO run in Docker; worker containers provide `httpx`, `nuclei`, `subfinder`, nuclei templates, and browser/screenshot Linux dependencies.
- First local stack defaults: app `http://localhost:3000`, Postgres `127.0.0.1:5432`, MinIO API `127.0.0.1:9000`, MinIO console `127.0.0.1:9001` with `minioadmin` / `minioadmin`.
- Worker roles are split by `STACKRAY_WORKER_ROLE`: `http` handles `http_probe/run_scan`, `intel` handles subfinder/nuclei/ip/finalize/schedules, `browser` handles headless/browser fallback, and `all` handles every task.
- Worker production images are intentionally slim and built by `worker/Dockerfile`; when changing worker startup commands, runtime imports, scripts, or assets, verify the Dockerfile copies every required file into `/app`.

## Architecture boundaries

- Stackray intentionally uses HTTP/JSON plus SSE, not `tRPC`, `oRPC`, or GraphQL. The web UI, agent API, and workers share persisted records as the source of truth.
- API/UI entrypoints live under `app/`; product route handlers call services in `lib/server/**`; shared payload schemas live in `lib/contracts/**`; worker orchestration lives in `worker/**`.
- `drizzle/schema.ts` is the database source of truth; `lib/db/schema.ts` is only the app-facing re-export.
- Product-resource API routes should accept either Better Auth session cookies or bearer API keys via `requireSessionOrBearerActor`; account/admin/API-key/user-product-state routes should stay session-only via `requireAppSession`. `lib/session/route-auth-boundaries.test.ts` enforces this split.
- Queue Graphile work through `enqueueGraphileJob`; scan creation queues `http_probe`, and worker task selection is role-based rather than one monolithic worker path.
- Scan progress is SSE from persisted `scan_events`; results must be written before being streamed.

## Drizzle, Graphile, and Railway migrations

- `scripts/startup-migrate.ts` is the canonical runtime migration path. Keep it: it loads `.env.local`/`.env`, takes a Postgres advisory lock, applies checked-in Drizzle migrations, then runs Graphile Worker migrations.
- Normal schema changes: edit `drizzle/schema.ts`, run `pnpm db:generate`, run `pnpm db:migrate:startup` against local Postgres, test with `pnpm dev:local`, and commit the generated SQL plus `drizzle/migrations/meta/*`.
- Do not rewrite the checked-in `0000_*` baseline for normal schema evolution. Current migration history already includes incremental `0001+` files; append the next migration.
- Avoid manually editing generated Drizzle artifacts (`drizzle/migrations/*.sql`, `drizzle/migrations/meta/*`) during normal work. If generated SQL looks wrong, fix the schema/source and regenerate.
- A full migration-history reset is exceptional and intended only for fresh/reset databases and template cutovers. If any database has applied an older migration lineage, do not reset checked-in history without an explicit reconciliation plan.
- `scripts/startup-migrate.test.ts` intentionally checks `_journal.json`, SQL files, snapshots, the `0000_*` baseline, and important historical migrations.

## Scanner and technology detection

- Scanner binaries are not npm deps. Pins live in `worker/scanner-pins.json` and are mirrored into `worker/Dockerfile` and `worker/Dockerfile.dev`; update with `pnpm scanners:update` or `pnpm scanners:update:patch`, not by hand.
- The worker image builds from the `CarlosCommits/httpx` fork plus pinned `nuclei`, `subfinder`, and nuclei-template refs. CI only builds the scanner image when scanner-impacting files changed.
- For technology detection, keep layers separate: detection rules in `lib/server/scans/custom-wappalyzer-fingerprints.json`, display metadata in `lib/server/scans/custom-technology-metadata.json`, generated upstream catalog in `lib/server/scans/generated/wappalyzer-catalog.json`, and repo-local nuclei templates under `worker/nuclei-templates/` registered in `worker/nuclei.ts`.
- Never hand-edit `lib/server/scans/generated/wappalyzer-catalog.json`; refresh it with `pnpm wappalyzer:update-catalog` and inspect catalog changes with `pnpm wappalyzer:diff-catalog -- [base] [head] --limit N`.
- Custom Wappalyzer fingerprints are passed to `httpx` with `-cff` in primary `-td`, screenshot `-td`, and runtime `-tdh` paths. Modern SPA evidence may require the pinned `httpx` fork, not just a JSON fingerprint.
- Register worker-used Nuclei templates in `NUCLEI_TEMPLATE_DEFINITIONS`; repo-local templates use `repoLocal: true` and run by `-t` path, while upstream templates run by `-id` unless `NUCLEI_TEMPLATES_DIR` is configured.
- TXT DNS fallback rules should stay YAML-backed in nuclei templates; do not add duplicate hardcoded TXT signature constants in TypeScript.

## Server-rendered performance

- Treat every server-rendered page and route handler as a query plan. Before adding data dependencies, identify which reads are required for first paint, which are independent, and which can be deferred or streamed.
- Drizzle queries, authentication lookups, and other non-`fetch` reads that may be repeated during one render should use React `cache()` for request-scoped deduplication. Prefer stable primitive cache arguments. Do not use request caching as a substitute for efficient SQL or indexes, and never cache mutations, job enqueueing, or other side effects.
- Run independent read-only operations concurrently with `Promise.all` only after verifying independence, transaction behavior, ordering, rate limits, and side effects. Keep genuinely dependent operations sequential.
- List and search endpoints must filter, order, and paginate in SQL before hydrating rows in Node.js. Do not load an unbounded table or result inventory and then sort, filter, deduplicate, or paginate it in application code. If derived-data filtering requires an exception, document it and keep the default path bounded.
- Every list endpoint must enforce a maximum page size. Fetch at most `limit + 1` rows when determining whether another page exists.
- Nonessential aggregates, filter-option inventories, exports, and secondary panels should not block initial route rendering. Load them on interaction or behind a Suspense/loading boundary where appropriate.
- New queries over growing tables must be reviewed against their filter, join, and ordering columns. Add a generated Drizzle migration for a supporting index when existing indexes do not match the access pattern.
- Performance-sensitive route loaders should have tests covering query bounds, pagination behavior, request-level deduplication, and safe parallel fan-out. Avoid tests that only verify rendered output while permitting unbounded data access.

## Repo conventions worth preserving

- Treat folder `index.ts` files as public external entrypoints only. Do not add barrel exports for module-internal helpers.
- For external scan artifacts, favicons, Wappalyzer icons, screenshots, and prototype previews, do not blindly replace raw `<img>` with `next/image` unless the source is internal, proxied/cached, or explicitly configured.
- Use `flatMap` for simple map-and-filter transformations where each input returns either `[]` or `[value]`; use one `for...of` loop when partitioning one array into multiple outputs.
- Use `toSorted()` for immutable sorting instead of `[...items].sort(...)`.
- Use `Set` or `Map` for repeated membership checks or lookups inside loops. Keep array order semantics explicit when changing deduplication code.
- Avoid array indexes as React keys unless the index represents a fixed spatial position. Prefer stable domain identifiers or stable value keys.
- Avoid numeric `&&` rendering in JSX. Use explicit boolean conditions so `0` cannot accidentally render as text or disappear as a valid value.
- Use deterministic date/time formatting for server-rendered text; volatile timestamps belong client-side or behind explicit locale/time-zone formatting.
- Event listeners opened in effects should use named callbacks and remove each listener in cleanup before closing the underlying resource.
- Do not export Next.js `metadata` from a client component. If metadata matters for a client-only page, split the route into a server page/wrapper plus a client component.
- For scan artifacts, favicons, Wappalyzer icons, screenshots, and prototype previews that can come from arbitrary external domains, do **not** blindly replace raw `<img>` tags with `next/image`. Use `next/image` only when the source is internal, proxied/cached through our domain, or safely covered by explicit image configuration and sizing.
- Export image capture: iOS/WebKit rasterizes html-to-image's SVG `foreignObject` in a detached document and `decode()` resolves before inner raster images finish decoding there, so a single canvas draw leaves the scan screenshot/favicon blank while inline SVG icons render (WebKit bug 219770). Keep export copy/download flows routed through `captureExportPngBlob`/`captureExportPngDataUrl` in `components/shared/image-export.ts`, which redraw the same SVG image multiple times on iOS before reading the canvas.
- For dead code cleanup, prefer removing `export` from module-internal symbols before deleting code. Keep contract schemas, view-model shape types, and behavior-oriented worker/session helpers unless a focused API/entrypoint review proves they are not intentional surface area.
- When Tailwind width and height utilities use the same value, prefer `size-*`.
