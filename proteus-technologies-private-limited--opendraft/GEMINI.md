# OpenDraft — Claude Instructions

## Open-Core Architecture

OpenDraft is the **open-source core** (MIT license). A separate **OpenDraft-Pro** repo (private, at `../OpenDraft-Pro/`) extends it with commercial plugins.

### Plugin System

The core exposes a plugin architecture so Pro features can be added without modifying core code:

- **Frontend:** `frontend/src/plugins/registry.ts` — `pluginRegistry.register()` to add menu items, sidebar panels, routes, and editor extensions
- **Backend:** `backend/app/plugins.py` — `register_router()` and `register_hook()` for API routes and lifecycle hooks
- **Integration points:** MenuBar appends plugin menu items, App.tsx renders plugin routes, ScreenplayEditor renders plugin panels and editor extensions

### Key Rules

- **Never add commercial/Pro features to this repo** — they go in OpenDraft-Pro
- Plugin architecture changes (registry, hooks, extension points) belong HERE
- Bug fixes to existing features go HERE — they automatically flow to Pro via git submodule
- The `pluginRegistry` import in MenuBar, App.tsx, and ScreenplayEditor is how Pro injects features at runtime

### Repo Relationship

```
OpenDraft (this repo, public, MIT)     ← upstream
    ↑
OpenDraft-Pro (private, proprietary)   ← imports this as git submodule at core/
```

## macOS Desktop Build — Code Signing & Notarization

The macOS `.dmg` is built via **GitHub Actions** (in `.github/workflows/release.yml`), same as Windows, Linux, and Android. It is signed and notarized automatically when the correct GitHub secrets are configured.

### GitHub Secrets for macOS

| Secret | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `APPLE_CERTIFICATE` | Base64-encoded `.p12` file containing the Developer ID Application certificate + private key |
| `APPLE_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD` | Password for the `.p12` file |
| `APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY` | `Developer ID Application: Base Information Management Pvt. Ltd. (335RGMFDB6)` |
| `APPLE_ID` | Apple ID email for notarization |
| `APPLE_TEAM_ID` | `335RGMFDB6` |
| `APPLE_PASSWORD` | App-specific password from appleid.apple.com |

### How to export the certificate as `.p12`

1. Open Keychain Access, find `Developer ID Application: Base Information Management Pvt. Ltd.`
2. Right-click → Export Items → save as `.p12` with a password
3. Base64-encode: `base64 -i certificate.p12 | pbcopy`
4. Paste into the `APPLE_CERTIFICATE` GitHub secret

### Local build (optional)

`./build-desktop.sh` can still build a signed `.dmg` locally if you have Apple credentials in `.env`.

### Common mistakes to avoid

- **Never skip signing/notarization** — unsigned `.dmg` files trigger "damaged and can't be opened" on user machines
- Use **Developer ID Application** certificate for direct distribution (not "3rd Party Mac Developer" — that's for App Store only)
- The App Store build (`build-appstore.sh` locally, or `build-mac-appstore` CI job) uses different certificates. Don't mix them up.

## macOS App Store Build (CI)

The macOS `.pkg` for the Mac App Store is built via **GitHub Actions** (in `.github/workflows/release.yml`, the `build-mac-appstore` job). This runs **in addition to** the direct distribution `.dmg` build — both are produced on every release.

### How it works

1. Builds the Tauri app unsigned (`APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY="-"`)
2. Re-signs with Apple Distribution certificate and App Store entitlements
3. Embeds the macOS provisioning profile
4. Packages as `.pkg` with the Mac Installer certificate
5. Uploads to App Store Connect via API key

### GitHub Secrets for macOS App Store

Reuses `IOS_CERTIFICATE` (Apple Distribution) and `APPSTORE_API_KEY*` secrets. Additional secrets:

| Secret | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `MAC_INSTALLER_CERTIFICATE` | Base64-encoded `.p12` of "3rd Party Mac Developer Installer" or "Mac Installer Distribution" certificate |
| `MAC_INSTALLER_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD` | Password for the `.p12` file |
| `MAC_APPSTORE_PROVISION_PROFILE` | Base64-encoded `.provisionprofile` for macOS App Store |

### Local build (optional)

`./build-appstore.sh` can still build locally if you have Apple credentials in Keychain.

## Promotion & Articles

Promotion materials (blog posts, articles, social media content) go in `Promotion/posts/` in the project root — **not** in `docs/`.

---

## Release Process

See `docs/RELEASE.md` for the full checklist. Key points:
- Use `./release.sh X.Y.Z` to automate the full release
- GitHub Actions builds **all platforms**: macOS (.dmg), Windows (.exe/.msi), Linux (.deb/.AppImage), Android (.apk/.aab), iOS (.ipa)
- macOS builds are signed and notarized via Apple secrets in GitHub
- Update "What's New" content in MenuBar.tsx and user-manual before releasing

---

## Android Build

The Android `.apk` and `.aab` are built via **GitHub Actions** (in `.github/workflows/release.yml`, the `build-android` job). There is no local Android build — the CI runner provides the SDK, NDK, and Rust cross-compilation targets.

### How it works

1. CI runs `tauri android init` to generate the Gradle project (since `src-tauri/gen/` is gitignored)
2. Patches `tauri.conf.json` to remove `externalBin` (no Python sidecar on Android — the app uses local SQLite)
3. If signing secrets are configured, patches `build.gradle.kts` with release signing config
4. Builds both `.apk` (sideloadable) and `.aab` (Play Store)
5. Uploads renamed artifacts (`OpenDraft_X.Y.Z_android.apk/aab`) to the GitHub Release

### GitHub Secrets for Android signing

For unsigned builds (testing), no secrets are needed. For signed/production builds, add these repository secrets:

| Secret | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64` | Base64-encoded release keystore (`base64 -i release.keystore`) |
| `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` | Keystore password |
| `ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS` | Key alias (e.g., `opendraft`) |
| `ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD` | Key password |

### Generate a keystore (one-time)

```bash
keytool -genkey -v -keystore opendraft-release.keystore \
  -alias opendraft -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 \
  -dname "CN=OpenDraft, O=Proteus Technologies"
base64 -i opendraft-release.keystore | pbcopy  # copy to clipboard for GitHub secret
```

### Local Android development (optional)

Requires Android Studio (or SDK command-line tools), NDK 27, and Rust Android targets:
```bash
rustup target add aarch64-linux-android armv7-linux-androideabi i686-linux-android x86_64-linux-android
cd frontend && npx tauri android init && npx tauri android build --apk
```

## iOS Build

The iOS `.ipa` is built via **GitHub Actions** (in `.github/workflows/release.yml`, the `build-ios` job). It runs on a macOS runner, builds the Tauri iOS app, and uploads to both the GitHub Release and App Store Connect.

### How it works

1. CI runs `tauri ios init` to generate the Xcode project (since `src-tauri/gen/` is gitignored)
2. Imports the Apple Distribution certificate and provisioning profile from GitHub secrets
3. Patches `tauri.conf.json` to remove `externalBin` (no Python sidecar on iOS — the app uses local SQLite)
4. Builds with `tauri ios build --export-method app-store-connect`
5. If App Store Connect API key is configured, uploads the IPA directly to App Store Connect
6. Uploads renamed artifact (`OpenDraft_X.Y.Z_ios.ipa`) to the GitHub Release

### GitHub Secrets for iOS

All secrets are required for the build to succeed:

| Secret | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `IOS_CERTIFICATE` | Base64-encoded `.p12` containing the Apple Distribution certificate + private key |
| `IOS_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD` | Password for the `.p12` file |
| `IOS_PROVISION_PROFILE` | Base64-encoded `.mobileprovision` file for the app |

For automatic App Store Connect upload (optional):

| Secret | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `APPSTORE_API_KEY` | Base64-encoded App Store Connect API key (`.p8` file) |
| `APPSTORE_API_KEY_ID` | Key ID from App Store Connect (e.g., `XXXXXXXXXX`) |
| `APPSTORE_API_ISSUER_ID` | Issuer ID from App Store Connect |

### How to export the iOS certificate as `.p12`

1. Open Keychain Access, find `Apple Distribution: Base Information Management Pvt. Ltd. (335RGMFDB6)`
2. Right-click → Export Items → save as `.p12` with a password
3. Base64-encode: `base64 -i distribution.p12 | pbcopy`
4. Paste into the `IOS_CERTIFICATE` GitHub secret

### How to get the provisioning profile

1. Go to developer.apple.com → Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles → Profiles
2. Create or download an App Store provisioning profile for `com.proteus.opendraft`
3. Base64-encode: `base64 -i OpenDraft_AppStore.mobileprovision | pbcopy`
4. Paste into the `IOS_PROVISION_PROFILE` GitHub secret

### How to create an App Store Connect API key

1. Go to appstoreconnect.apple.com → Users and Access → Integrations → App Store Connect API
2. Click "+" to generate a new key with "App Manager" role
3. Download the `.p8` file (only available once!)
4. Base64-encode: `base64 -i AuthKey_XXXXXXXXXX.p8 | pbcopy`
5. Note the Key ID and Issuer ID shown on the page
6. Add all three values to GitHub secrets

## Local iOS Device Build

**Always use `./build-ios-device.sh` to build and deploy to a physical iOS device.** Do NOT run `tauri ios build` directly — Tauri overwrites Info.plist on every build, stripping file association declarations (CFBundleDocumentTypes, UTImportedTypeDeclarations). The script handles building, patching Info.plist, re-signing, re-exporting the IPA, and installing on the connected device.

```bash
./build-ios-device.sh              # build + patch + install on device
./build-ios-device.sh --no-install # build + patch only (IPA in build/patched-export/)
```

**Always build for physical device in release mode** (the script does this by default).

---

## Local iOS Simulator Build

Building and running on the iOS simulator requires specific steps. **Do NOT use `tauri ios dev`** — it tries to start a new Vite dev server which fails if one is already running (the user runs the dev server in a separate terminal).

### Steps to build and run on iPad simulator

```bash
# 1. Build the frontend first
cd frontend && npm run build && cd ..

# 2. Build the iOS app for the simulator (debug, unsigned)
APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY="-" frontend/node_modules/.bin/tauri ios build --target aarch64-sim --debug

# 3. Boot the simulator (pick an iPad device)
xcrun simctl boot "iPad Air 11-inch (M3)"

# 4. Install and launch
xcrun simctl install "iPad Air 11-inch (M3)" src-tauri/gen/apple/build/arm64-sim/OpenDraft.app
xcrun simctl launch "iPad Air 11-inch (M3)" com.proteus.opendraft

# 5. Bring Simulator app to front
open -a Simulator
```

### Common issues

- **"Port 5173 is already in use"** — The user's dev server is running. Never use `tauri ios dev`; always use `tauri ios build` + `simctl install`.
- **"Couldn't recognize the current folder as a Tauri project"** — Run from the project root (`/Users/kandarpbaghar/ai-projects/OpenDraft/`), not from `src-tauri/` or `frontend/`.
- **PhaseScriptExecution failed** — Same root cause as above. Use the CLI build, not Xcode's Run button directly.
- **If `src-tauri/gen/apple` doesn't exist** — Run `frontend/node_modules/.bin/tauri ios init` first.

### macOS desktop (local testing)

```bash
# Unsigned build for local testing (no Apple credentials needed):
APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY="-" frontend/node_modules/.bin/tauri build
# Output: src-tauri/target/release/bundle/macos/OpenDraft.app
```
