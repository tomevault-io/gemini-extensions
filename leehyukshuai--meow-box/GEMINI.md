## You Must Obey

1. Think Before Coding
Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.

Before implementing:

State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.
2. Simplicity First
Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.

No features beyond what was asked.
No abstractions for single-use code.
No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
No error handling for impossible scenarios.
If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.
Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

3. Surgical Changes
Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.

When editing existing code:

Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.
When your changes create orphans:

Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.
The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

4. Goal-Driven Execution
Define success criteria. Loop until verified.

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:

"Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
"Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
"Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"
For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:

1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

These guidelines are working if: fewer unnecessary changes in diffs, fewer rewrites due to overcomplication, and clarifying questions come before implementation rather than after mistakes.

## What this repo is

Windows OEM vendor-key remapping tool.

It has two runtime processes:
- `Controller`: WinUI 3 desktop app for editing config and controlling the service
- `Worker`: background process that listens for OEM events and executes actions

The UI edits config only.
The Worker performs runtime behavior.

---

## Repo layout

- `src/MeowBox.Controller/`
  WinUI 3 control panel
- `src/MeowBox.Worker/`
  background worker, tray, OSD, IPC host
- `src/MeowBox.Core/`
  shared models, IPC contracts, config, native/system services
- `src/MeowBox.Setup/`
  WiX MSI installer project
- `assets/`
  packaged assets and default config templates
- `build/`
  all intermediate outputs and package staging
- `artifacts/`
  final distributables (`MeowBox/`, optional `.zip`, `.msi`)

Do not introduce new top-level output folders unless truly necessary.

---

## Current product shape

Controller pages:
1. `Mappings`
2. `Touchpad`
3. `Battery`
4. `Settings`

The app should feel like a compact desktop utility, not an admin console.

---

## Runtime model

### Controller

Main coordinator:
- `src/MeowBox.Controller/Services/MeowBoxController.cs`

Worker process startup:
- `src/MeowBox.Controller/Services/WorkerProcessService.cs`

IPC client:
- `src/MeowBox.Controller/Services/WorkerPipeClient.cs`

### Worker

Main host:
- `src/MeowBox.Worker/WorkerHost.cs`

Support services:
- `src/MeowBox.Worker/Services/WorkerPipeServer.cs`
- `src/MeowBox.Worker/Services/TrayIconService.cs`
- `src/MeowBox.Worker/Services/WorkerOsdService.cs`

Worker execution flow:
1. receive `InputEvent`
2. match against configured `Keys`
3. resolve enabled `Mappings`
4. execute the selected `Action`

---

## Config model

Runtime config path:
- `%LocalAppData%\MeowBox\config.json`

Primary model:
- `src/MeowBox.Core/Models/AppConfiguration.cs`

Config service:
- `src/MeowBox.Core/Services/AppConfigService.cs`

Current schema centers on:
- `Theme`
- `Preferences`
- `Touchpad`
- `Keys`
- `Mappings`

Do not reintroduce legacy config compatibility unless explicitly requested.
This project currently prefers a single clean schema.

---

## Localization architecture

The current localization system must stay on one lifecycle.

### Source of truth

- localized XAML UI text uses WinUI resource resolution via `x:Uid`
- localized code-behind / view-model text uses `MeowBox.Core.Services.ResourceStringService`
- localized language selection / resolution uses:
  - `src/MeowBox.Core/Services/AppLanguageService.cs`
  - `Microsoft.Windows.Globalization.ApplicationLanguages.PrimaryLanguageOverride`

### Required lifecycle

Always resolve the stored language preference to one concrete effective language tag first.

Current flow:
1. read stored preference from config
2. resolve it to a concrete tag (`en-US` or `zh-CN`)
3. apply that same tag to `.NET` culture through `AppLanguageService`
4. apply that same tag to WinUI through `Microsoft.Windows.Globalization.ApplicationLanguages.PrimaryLanguageOverride`

Rules:
- do not split localization into separate `.NET` vs WinUI language lifecycles
- do not keep a special empty-string `System` branch for WinUI after `.NET` already resolved a concrete language
- do not reintroduce controller-side ad-hoc XAML localization layers such as `XamlStringLocalizer`
- do not eagerly freeze localized strings in static initialization that depends on whichever culture happened to load first
- if a catalog or option list is user-visible, its localized text must be resolved against the effective language at access time or via per-language caching
- when fixing localization, prefer correcting the lifecycle or missing resource keys over adding fallback glue

### Resource files

- Controller loose resources live under:
  - `src/MeowBox.Controller/Strings/en-US/Resources.resw`
  - `src/MeowBox.Controller/Strings/zh-CN/Resources.resw`
- if a user-visible string is referenced by resource key, both languages must define it
- for unpackaged local runs and publish output, loose `Strings/**/Resources.resw` files must remain copied next to the app

---

## Assets

Application icon:
- `assets/app/app.ico`

OSD icons:
- `assets/osd/`

Packaged config templates:
- `assets/config/`

Rule:
- internal OSD icons must come from `assets/osd`
- application/tray icons must come from `assets/app`
- do not scatter built-in assets across random folders

---

## IPC / identity

Named pipe:
- `MeowBox.WorkerPipe`

Autostart entry:
- `MeowBoxWorker`

Single-instance mutex:
- `MeowBox.Worker.SingleInstance`

---

## Chinese text safety

- Never write Chinese text through PowerShell here-strings or any toolchain path with uncertain encoding.
- Prefer UTF-8-safe tools when editing localized strings.
- When scripting file writes, prefer Python with explicit `encoding="utf-8"`.
- After changing localization or any user-visible Chinese copy, scan `.cs`, `.xaml`, `.resw`, `.json`, and docs for broken placeholders like `??`, `???`, or replacement characters.
- If any Chinese text shows up as `?`, treat it as a real bug and fix it before finishing the task.

---

## Build and packaging

Primary local debug command:

```powershell
dotnet build .\src\MeowBox.Controller\MeowBox.Controller.csproj -c Debug
```

Packaging / scripted build command:

```powershell
.\build.ps1
```

Expected outputs:
- local runnable binaries under `build/bin/MeowBox/`
- internal worker runtime under `build/bin/MeowBox/runtime/worker/`
- hidden/shared intermediate outputs under `build/obj/`
- temporary packaging staging under `build/publish/`
- final distributables under `artifacts/`

Keep project files simple.
Keep all transient/intermediate outputs under `build/obj/` via `Directory.Build.props`.
Do not let `src/*/obj` reappear.

Current packaging targets:
- portable folder
- optional portable zip
- optional MSI installer

Packaging rules:
- user-visible entry point is `MeowBox.Controller.exe`
- `Worker` is internal runtime payload and may be staged under a subdirectory
- local runnable layout should stay unified:
  - `build/bin/MeowBox/`
  - `build/bin/MeowBox/runtime/worker/`
- `MeowBox.Core` should not create a visible standalone app folder under `build/bin/`; keep its direct output hidden under `build/obj/`
- package from MSBuild `Publish` outputs
- normal local debugging should work directly from `build/bin/MeowBox/`
- `dotnet build` on `MeowBox.Controller` should also produce the local worker runtime payload
- `build.ps1` is for release packaging only; it should not refresh `build/bin/MeowBox/`
- default `.\build.ps1` should emit `artifacts/MeowBox/`
- `-Zip` and `-Msi` add extra distributables on top of `artifacts/MeowBox/`
- default portable and installer payloads should prefer smaller framework-dependent `win-x64` publish output
- `build.ps1` only exposes these public switches:
  - `-Version`
  - `-Zip`
  - `-Msi`
- the Controller publish step must preserve loose WinUI `.pri` / `.xbf` resources in the publish directory, otherwise the unpackaged app can crash at startup

If you change packaging paths, update:
- `build.ps1`
- `README.md`
- this file

## UI constraints

### Core principles

- keep the app simple
- prioritize direct editing workflows
- avoid decorative UI without function
- avoid exposing implementation details to normal users
- prefer native/system-feeling interaction over flashy custom styling
- when a requested change naturally suggests a small adjacent polish or fix that is low-risk and clearly improves usability or consistency, do it directly
- do not stop to ask for confirmation on obvious follow-up polish unless the user explicitly asks for strict scope only or the change has non-obvious tradeoffs

### Layout

- resizing must remain stable
- `Keys` and `Mappings` lists must stay accessible in smaller windows
- main work areas should stretch and use available space
- avoid wasted empty regions

### Runtime information

Surface only user-meaningful state, such as:
- service running/stopped
- startup enabled
- tray icon enabled

Do not expose:
- raw watcher diagnostics
- internal event names unless needed for editing/debugging
- executable paths in normal UI
- multi-process architecture details in user-facing copy

### Editing model

- keep mapping creation fast
- focus the new mapping immediately after creation
- infer names from key + action whenever possible
- only show advanced fields when the action type needs them

### Action selection

- action picking should be scan-friendly
- use grouping/search/icon cues when helpful
- do not fall back to giant flat walls of options

### Visual tone

- calm
- native
- compact
- restrained

Prefer OEM/system utility feel over “product marketing UI”.
