# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

RapidFire AI is an experiment execution framework for LLM fine-tuning and post-training that enables hyperparallelized training, dynamic real-time experiment control (IC Ops), and automatic multi-GPU orchestration. The system uses chunk-based scheduling to allow concurrent training of multiple configurations even on a single GPU.

## Key Commands

### Development Setup

```bash
# Create and activate virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

lsof -t -i:8852 | xargs kill -9  # mlflow
lsof -t -i:8853 | xargs kill -9  # frontend
```

## Architecture

RapidFire AI uses a microservices-inspired distributed architecture:

### Core Components

1. **Experiment** (`experiment.py`): Top-level API for users. Manages experiment lifecycle, creates database tables, sets up logging and signal handlers. Entry point for `run_fit()` and `get_results()`.

2. **Controller** (`backend/controller.py`): Orchestrates the entire training lifecycle. Runs in the user's process. Responsible for:
   - Creating models from parameter configurations
   - Initializing and managing Workers
   - Running the Scheduler to assign chunks to workers
   - Handling Interactive Control Operations (IC Ops)
   - Monitoring training progress

3. **Scheduler** (`backend/scheduler.py`): Pure scheduling logic that assigns runs to available workers for specific chunks. Uses round-robin and fairness algorithms to ensure optimal GPU utilization. Tracks which runs have completed which chunks.

4. **Worker** (`backend/worker.py`): Separate GPU processes that execute actual training. Each worker:
   - Polls database for assigned tasks
   - Loads model checkpoints from shared memory or disk
   - Trains on assigned data chunks
   - Saves checkpoints back to shared memory/disk
   - Reports progress to MLflow

5. **Dispatcher** (`dispatcher/dispatcher.py`): Flask-based REST API for UI communication. Provides endpoints for:
   - Viewing experiment status
   - Interactive Control Operations (stop, resume, clone, delete runs)
   - Real-time run metrics

6. **Database** (`db/rf_db.py`): SQLite-based persistence layer with async operations. Stores:
   - Experiment metadata
   - Run configurations and status
   - Task scheduling state
   - Checkpoint locations

7. **Frontend** (`frontend/`): React-based dashboard (MLflow fork) with IC Ops panel. Displays live experiment tracking and enables dynamic control.

### Data Flow

1. User creates `Experiment` and calls `run_fit()` with configs and datasets
2. Controller creates runs in database and spawns Worker processes
3. Controller runs Scheduler loop to assign (run_id, chunk_id) to available workers
4. Workers poll database, load models, train on chunks, save checkpoints
5. Workers report metrics to MLflow and update database task status
6. Scheduler continues until all runs complete all chunks (epochs)
7. User can invoke IC Ops through UI to stop/resume/clone runs mid-training

### Shared Memory System

RapidFire uses shared memory (`utils/shm_manager.py`) to avoid disk I/O bottlenecks:
- Model checkpoints stored in shared memory between chunks (configurable via `USE_SHARED_MEMORY`)
- Registry tracks which models are in memory
- Process locks prevent concurrent access issues
- Fallback to disk for larger models

### Interactive Control (IC Ops)

Unique feature enabling real-time experiment control:
- **Stop**: Pause a run, saves checkpoint
- **Resume**: Restart a stopped run from checkpoint
- **Clone**: Create new run from existing, optionally warm-start from parent's weights
- **Delete**: Remove unwanted runs

Implemented via database state changes that Controller/Workers poll.

## Key Concepts

### Chunk-Based Training

Instead of training one model at a time for full epochs, RapidFire splits datasets into chunks and interleaves training:
- Dataset divided into N chunks (user configurable)
- Multiple runs train on different chunks concurrently
- Scheduler ensures fair distribution across GPUs
- Enables side-by-side comparison of hyperparameters with minimal latency

### Run Configuration

Runs are created from parameter configurations:
- Single dict: creates one run
- AutoML algorithms (GridSearch, RandomSearch): create multiple runs
- Each run gets unique ID, tracked in database
- Supports warm starting from parent runs (clone-modify)

### Task System

Database tracks tasks for coordination:
- **ExperimentTask**: High-level experiment state
- **ControllerTask**: Controller operations (create_models, schedule, etc.)
- **WorkerTask**: Worker operations (fit, validate, etc.)
- Status: PENDING → IN_PROGRESS → COMPLETED/FAILED

## MLflow Integration

RapidFire wraps MLflow for experiment tracking:
- Each RapidFire Experiment maps to an MLflow experiment
- Runs tracked with metrics, parameters, artifacts
- Checkpoints saved as MLflow artifacts
- UI extends MLflow with IC Ops panel
- Access MLflow directly at `http://localhost:8852`

## Development Notes

### Python Version

Requires Python 3.12.x (specified in pyproject.toml and README).

### Frontend Development

The frontend is a fork of MLflow. For frontend-specific guidance, see `rapidfireai/frontend/CLAUDE.md`.

To run frontend in development mode with hot reload:
```bash
cd rapidfireai/frontend
node ./yarn/releases/yarn-4.9.1.cjs start  # Runs on localhost:8853
```

### Database Schema

Defined in `db/*.sql` files. Tables include:
- experiments: Experiment metadata and paths
- runs: Run configurations, status, metrics
- tasks: Task queue for controller-worker coordination
- checkpoints: Checkpoint locations and metadata

### Environment Variables

- `RF_EXPERIMENT_PATH`: Base path for experiments (default: `./rapidfire_experiments`)
- `RF_TUTORIAL_PATH`: Path for tutorial notebooks (default: `./tutorial_notebooks`)
- `RF_MLFLOW_HOST`: MLflow tracking server Host (default: `localhost`)
- `RF_MLFLOW_PORT`: MLflow tracking server Port (default: `8852`)
- `USE_SHARED_MEMORY`: Enable shared memory for checkpoints (default: True)

### Logging

Multi-logger system using loguru:
- `experiment`: Experiment-level logs
- `controller`: Controller operations
- `worker_{N}`: Per-worker training logs
- `user`: User-facing messages
- `interactive-control`: IC Ops operations

Logs written to experiment directory.

### Testing Notebooks

Tutorial notebooks in `tutorial_notebooks/` demonstrate usage:
- Require HuggingFace token for model downloads
- Run via `jupyter notebook` or IDE with proper kernel
- Cannot run directly from CLI due to multiprocessing restrictions

## Common Patterns

### Creating an Experiment

```python
from rapidfireai import Experiment

exp = Experiment("my_experiment")
exp.run_fit(
    param_config=config_dict_or_automl,
    create_model_fn=my_model_factory,
    train_dataset=train_data,
    eval_dataset=eval_data,
    num_chunks=8,
    seed=42
)
results_df = exp.get_results()
```

### Defining Model Factory

```python
def create_model_fn(config):
    # config contains hyperparameters for this run
    model = YourModel(**config)
    return model, optimizer, loss_fn, trainer_config
```

### AutoML Usage

```python
from rapidfireai.automl import GridSearch

param_config = GridSearch({
    'learning_rate': [1e-4, 1e-5, 1e-6],
    'batch_size': [8, 16],
    'epochs': [3]
})
```

## Git Workflow

## README Guidelines

### Image URLs Must Be Absolute

Always use absolute URLs for images in `README.md`, not relative paths. The README is rendered on multiple platforms (GitHub, PyPI, npm, etc.), and relative paths only work on GitHub where the repository file structure is accessible.

**Correct:**
```markdown
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RapidFireAI/rapidfireai/main/docs/images/example.svg">
```

**Incorrect:**
```markdown
<img src="docs/images/example.svg">
```

Use the pattern `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RapidFireAI/rapidfireai/main/...` for all image references to ensure cross-platform compatibility.

## Troubleshooting

### GPU Issues

Run `rapidfireai doctor` to diagnose:
- CUDA installation
- GPU availability
- Driver version compatibility

### Port Conflicts

Common ports:
- 8853: Frontend dashboard
- 8852: MLflow tracking server
- 8851: Dispatcher API

Use port killing commands above if conflicts occur.

### Multiprocessing Issues

RapidFire uses `spawn` method for multiprocessing. Notebooks must be run through IDE or Jupyter, not CLI.
