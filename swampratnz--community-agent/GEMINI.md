# CLAUDE.md — conventions for this repo

Guidance for any Claude Code session working in `swampratnz/community-agent`.

## What this is

A TypeScript/Node service (the "NZ Claude Community" agent) that bridges a
Discord server and a WhatsApp number to a Claude Agent SDK agent with
persistent Postgres + pgvector memory and a gated three-tier RBAC model. Start
with `README.md`, then `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` and `docs/SECURITY.md`.

**To find your way around the code, read `docs/agents/`** — a committed context
pack aimed at exactly this situation: `module-map.md` says which module owns
which behaviour (security spine marked), `recipes.md` says what a given kind of
change normally touches and which gate catches a missed file. It exists because
every pipeline worker is a fresh Actions run, i.e. a cold session that would
otherwise re-derive this repo's layout on every single run. Use it instead of a
broad exploration sweep — then read the actual code, because the pack is
orientation and never authority. If it is wrong, fix it in your PR.

## Where the framework lives

The framework is **[`@swampratnz/agent-base`](https://github.com/swampratnz/agent-base)**,
consumed as a package: the agent kernel and prompt spine, the platform
adapters, storage, the router spine, the jobs mechanism, RBAC, config, the
notice-catalogue mechanism, alert/health infra, leaf utils. `src/base/` is GONE
and must stay gone — `npm run imports:check` fails outright if it reappears,
because a local copy forks the package silently. A framework-level fix belongs
upstream and reaches this repo as a version bump.

What is here:

- **`src/module/`** — this deployment's content and wiring: the tool registry
  and its `ToolDef` domain files, prose, personas, skills, the notice pack,
  community jobs and digests, the integrations, its schema fragments, and the
  composition wiring (`routerWiring.ts`, `platforms/factories.ts`,
  `jobs/registry.ts`, `commands.ts`).
- **`src/module/agentModule.ts`** — THE manifest. Every extension point this
  deployment fills, named once, as data. Its `init()` is also boot-fatal on two
  env vars: `DISPLAY_TIMEZONE=Pacific/Auckland` and `DISPLAY_LOCALE=en-NZ`.
  agent-base defaults them to `UTC`/`en-GB` — it cannot know a deployment's
  timezone — so the manifest asserts them rather than let every member-facing
  event time silently re-render an hour out. It throws from `init()`, so the
  failure is a plain `Error` with those two names in it, NOT config's zod
  `Invalid environment configuration` exit. Set both in `.env`.
- **`src/index.ts`** — the composition root: it hands that manifest to
  `createAgent`, then wires adapters, the router and the jobs, and owns
  startup/shutdown ordering. The only file that may compose.
- **`src/migrate.ts`** — `npm run migrate`: base fragments, then this module's.

**Adding an extension point** means exporting the value from the file that owns
the content and naming it in the manifest. Do NOT add a module-scope
`register*()` call, and **never render a `notice()` at module scope** — the
pack is registered by `createAgent`, AFTER every module has been imported, so
an import-time render throws before the process can say why. Tests opt into the
same registrations one slice at a time through `tests/support/register*.ts`.

`createAgent` owns the order and it is not negotiable from a module: plan (a
pure pass that rejects an incomplete or double-claimed composition with the
process untouched) → each module's `init()` → singleton registrations →
additive registrations → readiness probe → migrations → start.

One gap to expect, real today and an upstream fix: the manifest type has no
`configSchema` field, so a new env var is an agent-base change. Mind which
type you are reading — the package exports TWO things called `AgentModule`:
the live one from `createAgent.d.ts`, re-exported as `AgentModuleManifest`
(what `src/module/agentModule.ts` imports, and the one with no
`configSchema`), and an older `module-api/module.d.ts` one that has the field
but is not what `createAgent` takes. (Subpath
exports were the other one; `@swampratnz/agent-base@0.1.1` ships them, so
`@swampratnz/agent-base/<module>.js` resolves straight from the package and the
postinstall shim that used to add them is gone.)

## Build / test / verify

- `npm run typecheck` — must be clean. This now also runs
  `npm run typecheck:tests` (`tsconfig.tests.json`), because the main tsconfig
  covers `src/**` only and `tsx` strips types without checking them, so `tests/`
  went entirely untypechecked — which is how a whole class of test bug survived:
  an injected-`deps` object that omits a field silently falls through to the
  REAL repository function, so a "unit" test quietly queries live Postgres, and
  since `node:test` runs test FILES in parallel those stray reads land on tables
  other files are counting (a source of the cross-file flakiness that reddens
  unrelated PRs). `tests/` has a large backlog of pre-existing type errors, so
  this is an **incremental ratchet**: the config's `include` lists only the test
  files that are clean today, kept alphabetical one-per-line so concurrent PRs
  merge cleanly. Bringing another file to zero and adding it is the unit of
  progress; never delete an entry to turn a red build green. Related: the deps
  types in `memberDigest.ts`/`usageCostDigest.ts`/`backgroundJobCostAlert.ts`
  have **no optional fields** on purpose — pass nothing at all (production) or
  every field (tests); see `docs/STANDARDS.md` for the throwing-stub pattern.
- `npm test` — Node test runner via tsx; must pass. Security invariants live
  here (tool gating, confirm flow, secret redaction, WhatsApp wire helpers) —
  when you touch those areas, extend the tests.
- `npm run test:security` — runs every `SECURITY:`-prefixed test and enforces
  `tests/security-floor.json`, a per-file map of how many `SECURITY:` tests
  each test file declares (exact match, not a floor). When you add (or
  intentionally remove) a `SECURITY:` test, update that file's entry in the
  SAME diff — the gate's error message tells you exactly which entry, or run
  `npm run test:security:fix` to regenerate the manifest to the true counts.
  That helper only ever RAISES a count; a genuine removal needs `--allow-lower`
  plus a PR explanation, so it can't silently paper over a deleted security
  test. Per-file entries exist so concurrent PRs don't all conflict on one
  shared counter line, which is what the old global `MIN_SECURITY_TESTS`
  constant caused. The manifest is kept SORTED by file name (the gate enforces
  it; `test:security:fix` normalises it) so that two PRs adding entries for
  DIFFERENT new files land in different hunks and merge cleanly instead of
  colliding at a shared append point — when you add a new file's entry by hand,
  put it in alphabetical position (or just run the fix command).
  **The gate is blind to loss in transit.** It protects against deleting cases
  WITHIN this repo; a test file arriving in ANOTHER repo gets whatever count it
  shows up with, and that repo's manifest records the smaller number as
  correct. Moving tests to `agent-base` therefore needs a name-level diff
  against the source commit, not a count comparison — `gatedNotice.test.ts`
  crossed over having silently dropped 6 of its 7 cases, and both manifests
  agreed with each other the whole time.
- `tests/knowledgeEval.test.ts` + `tests/fixtures/knowledgeEval.json` — a
  golden-query regression eval for `knowledge_search` retrieval quality
  (precision@K against a curated, paraphrased query set with distractors).
  When you add or edit knowledge entries in a way that should be
  discoverable by a new phrasing, add a matching golden query there —
  queries must be paraphrases of the target entry, never near-verbatim
  quotes, or the eval proves nothing.
- `npm run imports:check` — the COMPOSITION-DIRECTION rules. Three of them:
  `src/base/` must not exist (the framework is the package; a local copy forks
  it silently), `src/module/` may never import the composition root, and only
  the composition root may import `createAgent` — a module contributes a
  manifest, it never composes one, because the registration ORDER is exactly
  what `createAgent` exists to own. Enforced twice on purpose: eslint's
  `no-restricted-imports` on `src/module/**` gives the fast local signal from
  the specifier text, and `scripts/check-import-direction.mjs` resolves every
  relative specifier against the file system, so it sees through any depth of
  `../` and has no config of its own to weaken. Runs in CI's `lint` job; pinned
  by `tests/importDirection.test.ts`.
- `npm run context:check` — freshness gate on the agent context pack
  (`docs/agents/`). Fails if a `src/` subsystem or top-level module has no
  entry in `docs/agents/module-map.md`, if an entry names a path that no longer
  exists, or if entries are unsorted, duplicated, or left as stubs. When you
  add, remove or rename a module, describe it in the SAME diff.
  `npm run context:fix` does the mechanical part (add/drop/sort) but
  deliberately CANNOT make the gate green — it inserts a `TODO` stub and the
  check keeps failing until someone writes the one-line description. A fixer
  that auto-satisfied this gate would let modules enter the tree undescribed,
  which is the exact rot it exists to prevent. Runs in CI's `lint` job.
- `npm run build` — tsc + copies this module's `src/module/storage/schema/`
  fragments into `dist/`, then smoke-checks that `dist/module/storage/schema/`
  matches the module manifest (`scripts/check-dist-schema.mjs`). The base
  fragments ship inside the installed package. It also copies two things tsc
  never emits, both load-bearing at runtime: `CHANGELOG.md` (the `whats_new`
  tool reads it) and `src/module/agent/skills/` (no copy, no skills). Adding a
  non-`.ts` runtime asset means adding a copy step here.
- DB-touching changes: CI runs the suite against a real
  `pgvector/pgvector:pg16` service container (see `.github/workflows/ci.yml`),
  so this is enforced, not just a manual reminder. (The base repository suite
  itself now lives in agent-base.) Do it locally too for the
  tight loop: run `npm run migrate` against a local Postgres 16 + pgvector
  with `DATABASE_URL` set, then `npm test` — DB-touching tests skip cleanly
  (not fail) when `DATABASE_URL` is unset, so a contributor without local
  Postgres isn't blocked.
- Run the FULL gate green before opening/updating a PR — CI runs the identical
  set, so a red PR only makes rework. The copy-pasteable command block lives in
  `docs/agents/recipes.md` ("Run the full gate"); it is
  `typecheck`, `lint`, `format:check`, `migrate`, `test`, `build`,
  `test:security`, `context:check`, `imports:check`.

## Security posture (do not regress)

This bot processes untrusted public chat. Preserve these invariants:

- Built-in Claude Code tools are disabled per turn (`tools: []`), with two
  exceptions: admin+ turns additionally get `WebSearch`, and every tier gets
  `Skill` when `AGENT_SKILLS_ENABLED` is on (off by default; the loadable set
  is the hand-written `ENABLED_SKILLS` allowlist, never `'all'`). `WebFetch` is
  disallowed for everyone. See docs/SECURITY.md §1.
- Roles come from env (super admins) + the `community_users` table — **never**
  from message content. Tool surface is tier-derived; privileged tools also
  re-assert the tier.
- Destructive actions are CONFIRM-gated and executed by the router, not the
  model. Outbound filtering (secret redaction + code policy) lives in the
  adapters' send paths.
- Admin data access is scoped in SQL to conversations the admin is in.

## Multi-loop pipeline

This repo is developed by a supervised multi-session pipeline — see
`docs/PIPELINE.md` for why each loop exists, and `docs/CICD.md` for the
mechanical reference (every workflow's trigger/permissions/timeout, the CI gate
and its check scripts, the mechanisms shared across loops, and what is portable
to another repo). If you are running as one of those loops, obey the
ownership rules:

- **Only the build loop** writes code or opens PRs. PR-review comments only;
  research & adversarial touch issues only. One exception: the **autofix loop**
  (`pipeline-pr-autofix.yml`) may push fixes to an existing build-worker PR
  branch when its CI fails — bounded to 2 attempts; same-repo bot PRs with a
  `Closes #` body only (unrelated bot PRs like Dependabot bumps and PRs
  already labelled `needs-human` are skipped); and only from CI
  `run_attempt` ≥ 2 (the ci-retry loop below gets one free machine rerun
  first, so agents never chase one-off flakes), then it escalates
  `needs-human`. It never opens or merges PRs. Before assuming a code defect it
  checks the two mechanical causes that dominate a concurrent queue and
  self-heals them rather than escalating: a `security-floor.json` per-file
  count mismatch (regenerated via `npm run test:security:fix`) and a flaky,
  unrelated test (re-run in isolation, and if it passes there, CI is
  re-triggered with an empty commit instead of pushing a bogus "fix"). When it
  genuinely can't fix something, its escalation comment now carries the agent's
  own final summary (the same diagnosability the build worker got in #251) so a
  maintainer isn't reverse-engineering it from run logs.
- The **conflict-resolver loop** (`pipeline-pr-conflict.yml`) may push a
  `main`-merge to an existing PR branch when that PR is
  CONFLICTING. It is two-hop: a `discover` job (triggered on every push to
  `main`, on PR opened/ready-for-review — a PR can be *born* conflicted — and
  on an **hourly** backstop sweep) finds conflicting same-repo PRs and
  self-dispatches the `resolve` job via `workflow_dispatch`, because
  claude-code-action won't run under a `push` event. The dispatch payload
  carries PR **numbers only**; resolve re-derives the branch from the API and
  re-verifies the full eligibility contract before checkout: same-repo (never a
  fork), not `needs-human`/`no-auto-resolve`, still CONFLICTING, and **either** a
  bot PR with `Closes #` **or** a maintainer PR whose author is in the
  `MAINTAINER_LOGINS` allowlist. So a hand-crafted dispatch can't aim it at an
  arbitrary branch, and a superseded duplicate run no-ops instead of
  mislabelling. It resolves a `security-floor.json` conflict by regenerating the
  manifest (`npm run test:security:fix`) rather than hand-counting, and its
  escalation comment carries the agent's final summary so an unresolved conflict
  says WHICH files couldn't be reconciled instead of the old opaque "incompatible
  or needs a workflows change". Both resolution paths (the deterministic
  floor-only fast path and the full agent) **re-run migrate AFTER
  merging main**, because the merge can bring migrations the pre-merge migrate
  didn't have — without it the DB-backed `test:security` fails on a stale schema
  (`column/relation ... does not exist`) and the resolver falsely escalated
  `needs-human` on a non-issue. Since the config split, migrate's import chain
  validates only the storage boot slice (agent-base's `config/boot.js`: db+log), so a
  bare `npm run migrate` works with just `DATABASE_URL` set — it no longer
  exits(1) demanding `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` (config validation exits(1)
  rather than throwing). `migrate:ci` remains as a compatibility alias
  (workflows still call it; its dummy token is now inert). Keeping it a plain
  `npm run …` means the existing `Bash(npm:*)` grant covers it, not a fragile
  exact-match command. One attempt
  per conflict: a
  failed resolution escalates `needs-human`, and the eligibility filter skips
  `needs-human` PRs so it never thrashes. Same push guardrails as autofix
  (read-only `gh`, exact `git push origin HEAD`). It never opens or merges
  PRs.
- The **revise loop** (`pipeline-pr-revise.yml`) may push review-response
  commits to an existing build-worker PR branch when the PR-review worker's
  verdict is "Changes requested" — the green-CI case autofix (CI-failure
  keyed) never touches. Two-hop like the conflict resolver: the review
  workflow's post step self-dispatches it via `workflow_dispatch` (a
  GITHUB_TOKEN-posted comment can never trigger a workflow), the payload
  carries the PR number only, and eligibility (same-repo, bot, `Closes #`,
  no `needs-human`) plus the still-pending verdict are re-verified from the
  API before checkout. Bounded to 2 attempts per PR via marker comments,
  then it escalates `needs-human`; a "Needs a human decision" verdict labels
  `needs-human` directly from the review workflow. Same push guardrails as
  autofix (exact `git push origin HEAD`; `gh` read-only except
  `gh pr comment` for explaining a principled refusal). It never opens or
  merges PRs.
- The **build-retry loop** (`pipeline-build-retry.yml`) auto-re-runs a build
  worker run that failed to produce a PR, via `gh run rerun`, bounded by
  `run_attempt` (≤3 total attempts). The build worker escalates `needs-human`
  only on its final attempt — clearing BOTH `status:building` and
  `status:approved`, so the escalated issue fully leaves the automated lanes
  and the hourly fallback can't re-claim it — so transient/infra failures
  recover unattended and a human is pinged only for persistent ones — don't
  re-add manual re-trigger steps for build failures. (A GITHUB_TOKEN label
  toggle can't re-trigger the build worker, which is why this uses rerun, not
  a label change.)
- The **groundskeeper sweep** (`pipeline-groundskeeper.yml`) is the
  deterministic, no-LLM hourly reconciler for zombie pipeline state: any open
  `status:building` issue with no open same-repo PR closing it and no
  activity for 4h+ is escalated `needs-human` (both status labels cleared).
  It exists because a build job that hits its 180-min timeout reports
  `cancelled` — invisible to both the failure-keyed retry loop and the
  final-attempt escalation — and a dead fallback-Routine claim leaves no run
  at all; either way the issue previously sat `status:building` forever,
  wedging the fallback lane and starving the approved queue. Like auto-merge
  it reads issue/PR fields only as jq data and runs no PR-controlled code.
- The **ci-retry loop** (`ci-retry.yml`) gives a failed CI run one blind
  machine rerun (`gh run rerun --failed`, `run_attempt` < 2) before any agent
  engages — transient npm-registry/runner failures recover for zero agent
  cost. It holds `actions: write` only, touches no code, and hands off to
  autofix from attempt 2.
- The **changelog-autofill loop** (`changelog-autofill.yml`, daily) is the one
  agent OUTSIDE this pipeline that writes to the repo, and the only one besides
  the build worker that opens a PR — worth knowing here precisely because the
  ownership rules above are otherwise read as "only the build loop opens PRs".
  It drafts the `CHANGELOG.md` entries `changelog-coverage.yml` found missing,
  on the fixed branch `chore/changelog-autofill`, and opens ONE PR for a human.
  It never touches issues, labels or `src/`, skips when an autofill PR is
  already open, and its grant is pinned rather than merely instructed: the exact
  push form `git push origin HEAD`, `gh pr create` pinned to the literal
  `--base main --head chore/changelog-autofill` prefix, and no
  `git checkout`/`switch` so HEAD cannot leave that branch. It never merges.
- The build worker runs the **full CI gate** (typecheck, lint, format:check,
  migrate, test against a real pgvector Postgres, build, test:security) BEFORE
  opening a PR, so "green locally" matches CI. Keep it that way when editing
  either `pipeline-build.yml` or `ci.yml` — they must run the same checks.
  It also **pushes its branch incrementally** (after the first commit and every
  commit thereafter — branch pushes trigger no CI and no PR exists yet, so they
  are free) because the job's GitHub credential can expire mid-build (~1h vs the
  180-min budget) and an unpushed tree dies with the runner; the PR still opens
  only at the end, so the verify-step/groundskeeper "no PR = dead build"
  contract is unchanged. A deterministic post-agent **checkpoint step** pushes
  any committed-but-unpushed work with the job's GITHUB_TOKEN (agents have
  finished whole builds without ever pushing — #633), so nothing committed can
  die with the runner. The surviving pushed branch + commit is published on
  **every** failed attempt, not only the last, and a re-queued build resumes
  from that branch instead of rebuilding (issue #667) — the pointer is
  resolved by a deterministic pre-step (bot comments only, exact template,
  remote-verified), never by the agent reading comment text. Publishing it
  only at the final attempt inverted the mechanism: retries need the pointer
  on exactly the attempts where retrying *continues*, and #701 attempt 1
  pushed a finished tree that attempt 2 then rebuilt from `main` from
  scratch.
  When a failed attempt leaves a pushed branch **ahead of `main` with no PR**
  — a build that did the work and skipped only `gh pr create` — the verify
  step opens that PR itself, as a **draft**, and relabels `status:built`
  rather than spending another attempt re-deriving the same diff. Recovery
  fires only while the issue is still `status:building` with no `needs-human`
  (an agent's deliberate step-5 refusal also leaves a branch ahead of `main`,
  and must stand), and never for a branch that has ever had a PR in any
  state (a closed-unmerged one means a human already rejected that work). Recovered
  work is not laundered by this: it never cleared the build agent's own gate,
  so CI on the PR adjudicates and the automated review still applies, and the
  PR is authored by `github-actions[bot]` — not the `claude[bot]` identity the
  auto-merge loop requires — so it can never auto-merge.
- **All three PR-fixing loops (autofix, conflict-resolver, revise) carry the
  same deterministic checkpoint** as the build worker, for the same reason.
  Each already instructs its agent to run every command synchronously and to
  NEVER end its turn waiting for one, and that instruction is provably not
  enough: the revise agent ended PR #606 with *"I'll wait for the monitor
  notification before continuing with the security test suite, build, and
  push"*, and the conflict resolver ended PR #609 waiting on a Monitor task —
  both had already COMMITTED work, which died with the runner, and both PRs
  escalated `needs-human` with nothing to show (#609's "unresolvable" conflict
  was then a clean merge a human finished in minutes). The checkpoint runs
  after the agent exits, pushes committed-but-unpushed work with the job's
  GITHUB_TOKEN, and only ever FAST-FORWARDS the PR branch — a remote that
  moved parks the work on a `-ckpt-<run_id>` ref instead of rewriting someone
  else's push. Because that work never cleared the agent's own gate, the
  recovery comment says so explicitly: CI on the push is the adjudicator and
  the automated review still has to pass, so a checkpoint can surface work but
  can never launder it into a merge.
- The **auto-merge loop** (`pipeline-pr-automerge.yml`) merges fully-vetted
  build-worker PRs, one at a time, so a backlog of green + approved PRs doesn't
  stall on a human. It is a **deterministic, no-LLM, no-Max-pool** shell loop
  (it reads PR titles/bodies/comments only as jq data, never as instructions,
  and runs no PR-controlled code — so it has none of the fix/resolve loops'
  injection/code-exec surface). It merges the OLDEST PR that is same-repo,
  authored by the build worker (`claude[bot]` — the exact identity, not merely
  any bot), `Closes #`, has all checks green, is `MERGEABLE`, and whose
  LATEST automated review verdict is an `LGTM` (from `github-actions[bot]`,
  the review worker's identity) newer than the head commit, and does NOT touch
  any governance/CI/config path (`.github/`, `scripts/`, `package.json`,
  typecheck/lint/format config, `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/PIPELINE.md`,
  `docs/VISION.md`) — those always require a human merge, so the loop can
  never auto-merge a change to its own guardrails or to what "green" means.
  `docs/SECURITY.md` is deliberately NOT on that list: every other entry can
  weaken the check that would catch it (PR-branch CI runs the PR's own
  workflows), whereas no workflow or check reads that document, so it is
  descriptive where the rest are causal. It is not inert — line 10 above
  points every agent at it, so a wrong edit can mislead one — but that pointer
  is shared with `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/STANDARDS.md` and
  `docs/agents/*`, none of them governed either, and the rules an agent must
  obey live in this file's security-posture section, which stays governed. It
  cost 64% of the list's human presses; `tests/securityDocSections.test.ts`
  now pins its section list instead, the same trade
  `tests/toolTierMap.test.ts` makes for the tier map — structural drift only,
  not content correctness.
  A governance-path PR that passes every other gate is not skipped silently:
  it gets a `human-merge-ready` label plus one marker-guarded comment asking
  a maintainer to merge (pipeline work routinely edits `.github/` or
  `scripts/` to fix the machinery itself, so this stays a well-trodden path
  even with `docs/SECURITY.md` off the list).
  Never one labelled `needs-human`/`no-auto-merge`. Exactly ONE merge per run:
  afterwards `main` has advanced, so it dispatches the conflict resolver to
  rebase the rest, and the next PR only re-qualifies once it is green against
  the new `main`. Branch protection on `main` is the enforceable backstop, as
  for every other loop (see docs/SECURITY.md). Pin a PR out with
  `no-auto-merge`.
- **No loop OPENS or force-pushes over a human's PR, and no loop merges a
  human PR** — only the deterministic auto-merge loop above merges, and only
  its own build-worker PRs under the gate described there. A human still
  merges anything that loop won't touch.
- WIP caps: ≤5 open `status:draft` (raised from 3 on the Max 20x pool). Builds
  run **per-issue** (each issue its own
  `concurrency` group, so distinct issues run in parallel and none evicts
  another — a single shared group would silently *cancel* queued builds, and
  cancellations aren't retried). Every run draws on the shared Max pool, so
  don't release large bursts at once: parallel builds throttle each other, and
  the mitigation is a generous build `timeout-minutes` (contended builds finish
  slowly rather than being killed), not a hard cap. A true FIFO lock is the
  proper fix if bursts keep saturating the pool.
- Coordinate only through issue labels; when blocked or ambiguous, add
  `needs-human` and stop rather than guess.
- Everything traces to an issue number; the build session works in its own git
  worktree.

## Conventions

- Match existing style; keep comments at the density of surrounding code.
- Never commit secrets. `.env` is git-ignored, as are the runtime credential
  directories `/auth/` and `/whatsapp-auth/` — note both patterns are ANCHORED
  to the repo root in `.gitignore`, so an unanchored `auth/` must never be
  re-added: it would swallow any source directory of that name.
- Do not put model identifiers in commits, PR bodies, or code.
- `CHANGELOG.md` `##` section dates are the **Pacific/Auckland (NZ)** calendar
  day, not UTC. The build worker runs in a UTC CI shell, so use
  `TZ='Pacific/Auckland' date +%F` for "today" — a bare `date` is a day behind
  NZ after ~noon local. Reuse the existing top section if it's already today's
  NZ date rather than opening a duplicate.
- Human-facing conventions (style, test expectations, commit/PR rules) are
  also written up in `docs/STANDARDS.md` — keep the two in sync if either
  changes.
