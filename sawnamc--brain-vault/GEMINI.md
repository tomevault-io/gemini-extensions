# Sawna's Second Brain — Claude Context File

Read this at the start of every session. Project-specific context lives in each project's own `CLAUDE.md` — this file is the vault-level index only.

## Who This Vault Belongs To

**Sawna Caradwyn.** 50 years old. Based in Holyoke / Western Massachusetts. Background in operations, HR, and accounting (15+ years). Currently building two businesses (Sage & Signal + Pebble's Path) while consulting for The Performance Project. This is a season of reinvention.

- **Partner:** Terna — romantic partner; co-creating PolyFool and Adventures of Owl & Mouse; plan to move in together once finances stabilize.
- **Son:** Nehemiah — grown; relationship naturally evolving.
- **Spiritual teacher:** William Douglas Horden — 15 years of study; *The Toltec I Ching*, *The Divine Dark* (2020), *The Soul of Numbers* (2025). Freely quotable across all projects.
- **Main goal:** $10K/month in revenue by May 2027. See [[GOALS.md]] for full plan.
- **Personality:** Strong starter, weak finisher. Binary motivation (on = unstoppable; off = stuck). ADHD-like scatter. Hates repetition. Can't self-regulate when hyperfocused.

**The governing principle:** This vault exists to produce things, not just store things.

## What Claude Should Do

1. **Read the project's `CLAUDE.md` first** — it has context, people, rules, and current status
2. **Read `🤖 Tasks.md`** for any client project before doing task work
3. **Read front matter** — it tells you note type and project
4. **Push toward output** — end every session with "here's the next thing to make"
5. **Don't pad** — Sawna wants concrete help, not summaries of what she already wrote
6. **Be a kind realist** — Sawna tends to be overly optimistic. Flag what could go wrong, as a devil's advocate, not a doom-sayer. She may disagree, but she wants the balanced view.
7. **Consult `🤖 Expansions.md` before adding new vault-level folders or root files** — it's the structure guide and friction layer. The two-yeses test is mandatory before any new top-level structure.

## What Claude Should NOT Do

- **Edit user-created files** (no `🤖` prefix) without asking first

## What Claude CAN Do

- **Create new notes anywhere in the vault**
- **Session logs** go in `00 Notes/` named `🤖 YYYY-MM-DD.md`

## Naming Convention

All Claude-created files:
- **Filename:** prefix `🤖 ` — e.g. `🤖 Integration Setup.md`
- **Front matter:** `author: claude`

## Skills

| Skill | Triggers | What It Does |
|---|---|---|
| `brain-setup` | "set up my vault", "initialize my brain", "build my CLAUDE.md" | Scans vault, interviews user, generates personalized root CLAUDE.md |
| `good-morning` | "good morning", "let's get to work", "start my day" | Reads vault, recaps work, recommends most important thing |
| `update-tasks` | "update my tasks", "refresh task lists", "clean up my tasks", "run task update" | Reviews and updates all project `🤖 Tasks.md` files. Auto-runs 7 AM daily; manual on demand |
| `end-of-day` | "/eod", "wrap up", "end of day", "we're done for the day" | Logs session, updates folder structure |
| `new-project` | "new project", "start a project", "create a project" | Interviews, creates project folder + files, updates this file |
| `progress-report` | "progress report", "log our progress", "save where we are" | Creates dated progress note for current session |
| `session-log` | "/log", "log this", "log this session", "save this session", "I want to clear", "capture before I clear" | Appends session block to `00 Notes/🤖 YYYY-MM-DD.md`. One file per day, multiple sessions stack. Run anytime before clearing a chat — no ceremony, just capture. |
| `ingest` | "ingest this", "ingest [URL/file]", "capture this", "process this", "/ingest" | Captures any readable source — YouTube, web article, vault-file PDF, script, transcript, book excerpt — saves raw capture, asks which 1–3 projects it touches, updates only those, appends to `🤖 Wiki Log.md`. Narrow scope by design — adapted from Karpathy's LLM Wiki. |
| `weekly-update` | "weekly update", "let's do a weekly review", "update my vault" | Interviews and updates root `CLAUDE.md`, `GOALS.md`, and each project's `CLAUDE.md`. Chains into `level-up` at the end |
| `level-up` | "level up", "what should I automate", "find me leverage", "what should I build this week" | Walks 3Ms interview (Mindset → Method → Machine) to scope and ship one automation. Chained from `weekly-update`. Writes decision to `🤖 Decisions.md` |
| `youth-stipend-invoice` | "create an invoice", "create a youth invoice", "create a stipend invoice", "make an invoice", "build an invoice" | Reads timesheet, pulls addresses, calculates pay, builds HTML invoice |

## Memory System

Two memory layers exist. Treat them differently.

### Layer 1 — Vault `MEMORY.md` (manual, user-maintained)

Lives at `Brain/MEMORY.md`. For facts the user has explicitly asked Claude to remember.

- **Read it at the start of every session.** Use what you find — don't announce it.
- **Write only when the user explicitly asks** ("remember this," "don't forget," "make a note," "log this").
- **Memories are persistent** — never auto-delete or expire.
- **Flag contradictions** — don't silently overwrite existing entries.

*This file is maintained by Sawna. Update it when projects change.*

### Layer 2 — Auto-memory (Claude Code, background)

Lives at `~/.claude/projects/-Users-sawnacaradwyn-.../memory/`. Symlinked into the vault as `🤖 Auto Memory/` for visibility in Obsidian. Captures preferences and corrections session-over-session.

- **Read the auto-memory index at the start of every session.** Use what you find — don't announce it.
- **Propose, don't silently write.** At session end (via `end-of-day`), surface 0–3 candidate auto-memories from the session and ask before writing.
- **Project memories stay gated.** Project-type entries (deadlines, client facts, decisions) still require an explicit ask even with the propose pattern. False signal there is high-cost.
- **Monthly review.** Once a month, open `🤖 Auto Memory/` and skim. Push back on anything wrong or stale.
