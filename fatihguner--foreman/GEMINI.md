# Foreman — Project Context

Foreman is an open-source, AI-powered strategic advisor for entrepreneurs. It uses a layered architecture of Skills, Agents, Hooks, Memory, Diagnostics, Playbooks, Commands, and Output Templates to deliver contextual, framework-driven guidance. The project lives at foreman.sh and ships as a public GitHub repository.

## Architecture Overview

```
Entrepreneur Input
    |
    ├→ [Commands] — Structured input: /apply, /diagnose, /run, etc.
    └→ [Hooks] — Natural language input: pattern matching → intent classification
            |
       [Orchestrator Agent] — Central brain, routes everything
            |
            ├→ [Memory Agent].read() — Retrieve entrepreneur context (5-layer system)
            |
            ├→ [Diagnostic Agent] — Triage: symptom → targeted questions → root cause
            |
            ├→ [Skill Executor Agent] — Apply framework to entrepreneur's context
            |
            ├→ [Playbook Runner Agent] — Run multi-step skill chains with checkpoints
            |
            ├→ [Output Agent] — Format results for target audience
            |
            └→ [Memory Agent].write() — Persist results and decisions
```

## System Layers

### Core Content Layers

1. **Skills** (`.claude/skills/`) — 158 self-contained `.md` files across 12 categories, each teaching one business framework, method, or practice. Every skill works standalone and can be invoked by an agent. Derived from 12 source collections.
2. **Output Templates** (`.claude/output-templates/`) — 48 fill-in-the-blank professional documents across 5 audiences: `investor/` (10), `board/` (7), `team/` (13), `self/` (10), `client/` (8).
3. **Diagnostics** (`.claude/diagnostics/`) — 20 triage systems (12 broad + 8 granular) that identify root causes through structured questioning. Each routes to specific skills, playbooks, and templates.
4. **Playbooks** (`.claude/playbooks/`) — 20 multi-step recipes (12 core + 8 extended) that chain skills sequentially with checkpoints and decision points.

### Orchestration Layers

5. **Hooks** (`.claude/hooks/`) — 17 trigger definitions (8 high-priority, 8 medium/low, 1 research) that classify natural-language input and route to diagnostics, skills, or playbooks.
6. **Agents** (`.claude/agents/`) — 6 AI agent definitions: orchestrator (central brain), diagnostic (triage), skill-executor (framework application), playbook-runner (multi-step conductor), output (formatting), memory (context persistence).
7. **Memory** (`.claude/memory/`) — 5-layer persistence system: identity (yearly), company (monthly), history (append-only), active (weekly), session (ephemeral). Schema + YAML templates.
8. **Commands** (`.claude/commands/`) — ~45 commands across 13 command files: navigation (7), execution (5), memory (8), playbook (5), output (3), meta (5).

### Tooling & Modes

9. **Scripts** (`scripts/`) — 21 utility scripts: validation (7), content creation (5), analysis (3), maintenance (4), community (2).
10. **Solo Mode** (`.claude/solo-mode/`) — Complete solopreneur adaptation layer: SOLO.md (master instruction), skill relevance scoring (158 skills), audience remapping (48 templates), diagnostic/playbook/hook adaptations (56 items). Activated via `/solo`.
11. **Stoic Mode** (`.claude/stoic-mode/`) — Philosophical depth layer that frames all system responses through Stoic principles (dichotomy of control, cardinal virtues, premeditatio malorum, amor fati). Does not change WHAT is delivered — changes HOW it is framed. Activated via `/stoic on`. Can combine with Solo Mode.
12. **Language Mode** (`.claude/language-mode/`) — Complete output language switch. All responses delivered in the specified language while internal processing remains English. Supports any language the model speaks fluently. Activated via `/language [code]`. Persists across sessions. Combines with Solo and Stoic modes.
13. **Industry Packs** (`.claude/industry-packs/`) — Sector-specific overlay system. Each pack adds benchmarks, skill overlays, diagnostic rules, and template adaptations for a specific industry. 9 packs: SaaS, Marketplace, E-Commerce, Fintech, AI/ML, HealthTech, EdTech, D2C/Consumer, Agency/Consulting. Each pack contains 4 YAML files (benchmarks, skill-overlays, diagnostic-rules, templates). Activated automatically when `memory.company.sector` matches a pack.
14. **Implementation Tracking** (`.claude/implementation/`) — Accountability layer that tracks execution of playbook steps and skill recommendations. Tracks implementation items through 6 states (not-started → in-progress → blocked → completed → abandoned → deferred), categorizes blockers (resource, knowledge, dependency, motivation, external), runs weekly check-in protocol via `/check-in`, and routes stalled items to relevant diagnostics. Integrates with Stoic mode (dichotomy of control on blockers) and Solo mode (isolation-aware tracking). Includes 3 templates (dashboard, weekly report, blocker analysis) and 4 commands (`/track`, `/progress`, `/blockers`, `/check-in`). Extended by Implementation Support (`support/`) — blocker diagnosis (10 root causes), stuck protocols (14 categories, skill-specific interventions), and implementation retrospective template.
15. **Custom Research Prompts** (`.claude/research/`) — 18 structured research guides teaching entrepreneurs HOW to gather data needed for frameworks: market-sizing-worksheet, competitor-research-template, customer-interview-guide, data-collection-plan, pricing-research-guide, due-diligence-research, user-testing-protocol, industry-mapping-guide. Each guide: what to collect, where to find it, how to interpret it, which skills it feeds into. Accessible via `/research` command.
16. **Board Simulation** (`.claude/simulation/`) — Adversarial role-play system for practicing board presentations, investor pitches, and due diligence sessions. 5 board personas, 5-dimension scoring framework, post-simulation diagnostic, memory persistence. Activated via `/simulate` command.
17. **Organizational Politics Navigation** (`.claude/org-politics/`) — Stakeholder dynamics management system. Maps power structures, diagnoses resistance, builds coalitions, designs influence strategies. Includes 2 diagnostics (stakeholder-resistance, power-dynamics), 1 playbook (organizational-alignment), 3 templates (influence-map, resistance-plan, coalition-plan), and 4 commands (`/stakeholders`, `/power-map`, `/resistance`, `/coalition`). Integrates with simulation for adversarial practice.
18. **Claude Code Plugin Marketplace** (`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` + `plugins/foreman/`) — Plugin marketplace for Claude Code. Users install via `/plugin marketplace add fatihguner/foreman` → `/plugin install foreman@foreman-marketplace`. 158 skills exposed as symlinks to `.claude/skills/`.
19. **Codex Plugin** (`.codex-plugin/`) — OpenAI Codex plugin manifest and build system. `plugin.json` manifest defines the plugin identity and component paths. `scripts/build-codex.sh` transforms `.claude/skills/` into Codex-compatible `skills/skill-name/SKILL.md` format. Generated `skills/` directory is gitignored. Marketplace config at `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`.
19. **OpenClaw Plugin** — Native OpenClaw plugin (`openclaw.plugin.json` + `package.json` + `index.ts`). Registers 7 agent tools (apply_skill, diagnose, run_playbook, list_skills, research, simulate, track) that read from `.claude/` at runtime. Claude bundle fallback at `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`.
20. **OpenClaw Templates** (`openclaw-templates/`) — 6 workspace templates (SOUL, IDENTITY, AGENTS, BOOT, BOOTSTRAP, HEARTBEAT) that define Foreman's personality and behavior when running as an OpenClaw agent. Users copy to workspace root. CLI scripts: `openclaw-setup.sh` (installation), `openclaw-build.sh` (validation).
21. **Schemas** — Template files across `_schema/` directories defining the structure for skills, diagnostics, playbooks, hooks, output templates, agents, commands, memory, industry packs, and research guides.

### Cross-Cutting Concerns

- **Stage Mapping**: Every skill carries stage tags (`idea`, `validation`, `early-traction`, `growth`, `scale`). Agents filter and adapt based on the entrepreneur's stage from Memory.
- **Anti-Patterns**: Each skill includes when NOT to use the framework and common mistakes.
- **Solo Mode**: `/solo` command activates solopreneur adaptations across all layers — skill relevance filtering, audience remapping, diagnostic/playbook reframing.
- **Stoic Mode**: `/stoic on` command activates Stoic philosophical lens across all outputs — dichotomy of control framing, virtue-based anti-patterns, premeditatio malorum risk sections. Combines with Solo Mode.
- **Language Mode**: `/language [code]` switches all output to the specified language. System thinks in English, speaks in target language. Combines with all other modes.

## Skill Specification

### Versioning

Every skill file carries a semantic version (`version: 1.0.0`) in its frontmatter. Versions follow semver: breaking structural changes = major, content additions = minor, fixes/polish = patch.

### Schema

Each skill is a Markdown file with YAML frontmatter. The frontmatter provides machine-readable metadata so agents can select, filter, and invoke skills programmatically.

**Required frontmatter fields:**
- `name` — Unique identifier, kebab-case, max 64 chars, lowercase + numbers + hyphens only
- `description` — What the skill does and when to use it. Third person, max 1024 chars. Must include trigger terms for discovery.
- `version` — Semantic version
- `category` — Category slug matching the directory name
- `stage` — Array of applicable stages: `idea`, `validation`, `early-traction`, `growth`, `scale`
- `tags` — Searchable keyword array
- `related_skills` — Array of related skill names
- `complexity` — `basic`, `intermediate`, `advanced`
- `author` — Contributor attribution

**Required body sections (order may vary per skill):**
1. Opening — A strong, hook-driven introduction (no generic preambles)
2. Core Framework — The framework explained with depth and precision
3. Application Prompts — Multiple AI prompts the entrepreneur can use
4. Use Cases — Concrete entrepreneurial scenarios
5. Anti-Patterns — When NOT to use this framework + common mistakes
6. Stage-Specific Guidance — How application differs by company stage
7. Output Template — A ready-to-use format for presenting results
8. Related Skills — Cross-references to complementary frameworks

### Differentiation Strategy

When generating multiple skills, apply deliberate variation across these dimensions to prevent homogeneity:

| Dimension | Variation Techniques |
|-----------|---------------------|
| **Opening** | Rotate: paradox, case study, provocative question, counter-intuitive claim, historical anecdote, data point, metaphor |
| **Narrative voice** | Match the framework's nature: pragmatic tools get direct language; visionary frameworks get expansive language; analytical frameworks get precise, data-driven language |
| **Internal structure** | Vary: tables vs. scenarios vs. Q&A vs. step-by-step vs. decision trees vs. before/after comparisons |
| **Rhythm** | Alternate sentence length patterns; avoid repeating the same paragraph cadence across skills |
| **Opening words** | Never start two skills with the same first word or sentence structure |

## Other Layer Specifications

### Diagnostics
20 triage files in `diagnostics/`. Each has: entry symptoms (natural language), 5-7 triage questions (decision tree), diagnosis map, routing (skills + playbooks + templates), red flags. Schema: `.claude/diagnostics/_schema/diagnostic-template.md`.

### Playbooks
20 multi-step recipes in `playbooks/`. Each has: trigger diagnostics, 4-7 steps (each with skill, purpose, output, checkpoint), decision points, final deliverables, common pitfalls, adaptation notes. Schema: `.claude/playbooks/_schema/playbook-template.md`.

### Hooks
16 trigger definitions in `hooks/`. Each has: 10-15 trigger patterns (natural language), intent classification, routing logic (decision tree), disambiguation rules, example conversations. Schema: `.claude/hooks/_schema/hook-template.md`.

### Output Templates
48 fill-in-the-blank templates in `output-templates/`. Organized by audience: investor (10), board (7), team (13), self (10), client (8). Each has: name, description, audience, applicable_skills, format, fill-in placeholders. Schema: `.claude/output-templates/_schema/output-template.md`.

### Agents
6 agent definitions in `agents/`. Roles: orchestrator, diagnostic, skill-executor, playbook-runner, output, memory. Each has: role, responsibilities, activation conditions, workflow (pseudocode), interactions, decision rules, error handling, example flows. Schema: `.claude/agents/_schema/agent-template.md`.

### Memory
5-layer system in `memory/`. Layers: identity (yearly), company (monthly), history (append-only), active (weekly), session (ephemeral). Schema: `.claude/memory/_schema/memory-schema.md`. Templates: `.claude/memory/_template/*.yaml`.

### Commands
33 commands in 6 groups in `commands/`. Groups: navigation (7), execution (5), memory (8), playbook (5), output (3), meta (5). Schema: `.claude/commands/_schema/command-template.md`.

### Scripts
21 bash scripts in `scripts/`. Categories: validation (7), content creation (5), analysis (3), maintenance (4), community (2). All executable, with --help flags.

### Solo Mode
5 files in `solo/`. Activates via `/solo` command. Adapts all layers for solopreneurs: skill relevance scoring, audience remapping, diagnostic/playbook/hook adaptations. Config-driven — no content duplication.

## Writing Style Guide

These rules apply to ALL files in the repository.

### Tone
Analytical, intelligent, sophisticated, with a thread of dry irony. Objective stance with sharp perspective and subtle wit. Never ponderous. Never didactic.

### Structure
Open every piece with a sentence that commands attention. No throat-clearing, no preamble. Short, precise paragraphs. Clarity of thought above all.

### Syntax
Clean, exact, elegant sentences. Build rhythm by alternating short declarative sentences with more complex constructions. Observe grammatical precision.

### Lexicon
Rich, precise vocabulary. No cliches. No jargon for jargon's sake. Every word earns its place.

### Voice
Institutional and authoritative. Write as though representing a respected analytical body. The tone sits between The Economist, Harvard Business Review, and McKinsey Quarterly.

### Absolute Prohibitions
- "In today's fast-paced..." or any variant
- "Let's dive in" / "Let's explore"
- "In this skill, you will learn..."
- "Without further ado"
- "It's important to note that"
- "At the end of the day"
- Emoji in any file content
- Rhetorical questions as paragraph openers (one per file maximum)
- Starting consecutive paragraphs with the same word
- Referencing source material authors by name (all content is anonymized)

## Project Identity

- **Name:** Foreman
- **Domain:** foreman.sh
- **Language:** English (all content and code)
- **License:** TBD
- **Target audience:** Entrepreneurs at all stages (idea through scale) + solopreneurs (via /solo mode)
