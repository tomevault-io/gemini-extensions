# Management Science & Operations Research Paper Writing

## Overview

Management Science & Engineering (MS&E) papers follow a distinct pipeline: **Model → Analysis → Algorithm → Numerical Experiment → Managerial Insight**. Unlike ML papers that prioritize empirical results, MS&E papers are evaluated on the **coherence of the analytical chain** — from modeling assumptions through mathematical derivation to computational validation and finally to actionable business implications.

This skill provides journal-specific guidance for 13 flagship MS&E journals across two tiers, covering the full paper lifecycle.

**Core Principle**: An MS&E paper is a **mathematical argument with managerial purpose**. Every equation, lemma, and table must serve the narrative that connects a real problem to a rigorous solution.

---

## When to Use This Skill

- Drafting a paper targeting MS, OR, MSOM, POM, or any MS&E journal
- Deciding which journal best fits a particular model-method-contribution combination
- Structuring a model-analysis-algorithm paper
- Writing proofs, algorithm pseudocode, or numerical experiment sections
- Formulating managerial insights from mathematical results
- Revising based on reviewer feedback from an MS&E journal
- Converting a working paper between MS&E journal formats

## Journal Selection Quick Reference

Choosing the right journal is a function of your paper's **methodology depth**, **problem scope**, and **practical relevance**.

### Tier 1 (UTD-24): Top Flagship Journals

| Journal | Core Identity | Ideal Paper Profile |
|---------|--------------|---------------------|
| **MS** (Management Science) | Broad management, high rigor, significant contribution | Novel problem + sharp analytical insight + broad appeal across management disciplines. Length: ~38 pages submission. |
| **OR** (Operations Research) | Methodological depth, optimization focus | Deep theoretical advance in optimization/stochastics. Complete proofs. Methodology-first contribution. |
| **MSOM** (M&SOM) | Empirical OM, behavioral operations | Strong empirical component or behavioral experiment. Managerially relevant. Data-driven modeling. |
| **POM** (Production & Oper. Mgmt) | Data-driven, broad OM scope | Empirical or analytical paper with strong practical relevance to production/service operations. |

### Tier 2: Strong Field Journals

| Journal | Core Identity | Ideal Paper Profile |
|---------|--------------|---------------------|
| **TS** (Transportation Science) | Transportation systems, network models | Transportation-specific problem. Network optimization, traffic equilibrium, logistics. |
| **TRB** (Transportation Research B) | Transportation methodology | Methodological advance in transportation modeling, rigorous proofs. |
| **DS** (Decision Sciences) | Decision-making focus | Decision analysis, multi-criteria methods, judgment under uncertainty. |
| **OMEGA** | Concise, high-impact, managerial | Short, sharp papers (~6000 words max). Strong managerial insights mandatory. |
| **TRE** (Transportation Research E) | Logistics & transportation | Supply chain and logistics modeling. Empirical or analytical. |
| **EJOR** (European J. Operational Research) | Broad methodology, inclusive | Any OR methodology applied to a real problem. Welcomes heuristic methods. Types: Invited Review, Innovative Applications, Theory & Methodology. |
| **IJPE** (Int. J. Production Economics) | Production economics, supply chain | Manufacturing/service operations with economic analysis. Strong on real data. |
| **IJPR** (Int. J. Production Research) | Production engineering | Process design, scheduling, manufacturing systems. Engineering focus. |
| **C&IE** (Computers & Industrial Eng.) | Computational methods, IE | Algorithm-heavy, simulation, AI/ML for industrial engineering. Implementation emphasis. |

### Decision Flowchart

```
Is your contribution primarily methodological?
├── YES → Is it a deep theoretical advance in optimization?
│   ├── YES → OR, possibly MS (Optimization dept)
│   └── NO → Is the method heuristic/computational?
│       ├── YES → EJOR, C&IE, IJPR
│       └── NO → MS, DS
└── NO → Is your contribution primarily empirical/applied?
    ├── YES → Does it have broad managerial appeal?
    │   ├── YES → MS, MSOM, POM, OMEGA
    │   └── NO → IJPE, IJPR, TRE, C&IE
    └── NO → Hybrid (model + data) → MSOM, POM, EJOR
```

## The MS&E Paper Structure

Unlike IMRAD for biomedical sciences or the systems paper blueprint, an MS&E paper typically follows this structure:

| Section | Typical Pages | Key Content |
|---------|--------------|-------------|
| Abstract | 150-250 words | Problem, methodology, key results, managerial implication |
| S1 Introduction | 2-3 pages | Motivation, gap, contributions (numbered), paper organization |
| S2 Literature Review | 2-4 pages | Organized by stream, explicit differentiation table |
| S3 Model | 4-8 pages | Notation, assumptions, base model, extensions |
| S4 Analysis / Derivation | 4-10 pages | Lemmas, propositions, theorems with proofs |
| S5 Algorithm / Solution Method | 2-5 pages | Pseudocode, complexity, approximation guarantees |
| S6 Numerical Experiments | 4-8 pages | Setup, parameter settings, main results, sensitivity analysis |
| S7 Managerial Insights / Discussion | 1-3 pages | Actionable implications, connected to practice |
| S8 Conclusion | 0.5-1 page | Summary, limitations, future work |
| References | — | 30-60 papers typical |
| Appendix | Unlimited | Long proofs, additional experiments, robustness checks |

**Key structural difference from ML/CS papers**: The **Model section is the backbone**. It occupies the most central real estate. If your model is unclear, the rest of the paper collapses. Reviewers read the model section before anything else after the introduction.

---

## Modeling Conventions

See [references/modeling-conventions.md](references/modeling-conventions.md) for comprehensive guidance. Key principles:

### Notation System
- Use a **consistent three-tier notation**: sets (calligraphic), parameters (lowercase), decision variables (uppercase or bold), dual variables (Greek)
- Present a **notation table** (for papers with 15+ symbols)
- Define all symbols at first use; never assume the reader infers from context

### Assumption Presentation
- List assumptions as **numbered statements** (Assumption 1, 2, 3...)
- For each assumption, state: (a) what it is, (b) why it is needed, (c) whether it is restrictive and what happens if relaxed
- **Assumption defense**: Explain why each assumption is reasonable in the target application context
- Use **assumption-relaxation extensions** ($4-6 pages) to demonstrate robustness

### Model Types by Journal Preference

| Model Type | MS | OR | MSOM | POM | EJOR | IJPE |
|-----------|-----|-----|------|-----|------|------|
| Analytical (optimization/game theory) | ✓✓✓ | ✓✓✓ | ✓✓ | ✓ | ✓✓✓ | ✓✓ |
| Stylized analytical + numerical | ✓✓ | ✓✓ | ✓✓✓ | ✓✓ | ✓✓ | ✓✓ |
| Data-driven empirical | ✓✓ | — | ✓✓✓ | ✓✓✓ | ✓ | ✓✓✓ |
| Simulation-based | ✓ | — | ✓ | ✓ | ✓✓ | ✓✓✓ |
| Heuristic/metaheuristic | — | — | — | ✓ | ✓✓✓ | ✓✓✓ |

## Proof and Derivation Standards

See [references/proof-derivation-guide.md](references/proof-derivation-guide.md) for comprehensive guidance. Key principles:

### Proof Presentation Hierarchy
```
Lemma 1 (Technical result) → Proposition 1 (Structural property) → Theorem 1 (Main result) → Corollary 1 (Special case)
```

### Journal-Specific Proof Expectations

| Journal | Full Proof in Body | Proof Sketch Tolerated | Appendix Proofs | Proof Length Tolerance |
|---------|-------------------|----------------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| MS | Short proofs in body; long ones appendix | For non-central results only | Yes, unlimited | Concise proofs preferred |
| OR | Complete proofs in body | Rarely | Yes | No length constraint on proofs |
| MSOM | Streamlined in body; full in appendix | Yes, for some results | Yes | Condensed preferred |
| POM | Streamlined in body | Yes | Yes | Condensed preferred |
| EJOR | Complete in body or appendix | Yes | Yes | Moderate |
| IJPE/IJPR | Minimal in body | Yes, often | Yes | Short |
| C&IE | Minimal | Yes, frequently | Optional | Very short |

### Proof Writing Guidelines
1. **State the result before proving it.** Use "We next establish that..." or "The following proposition characterizes..."
2. **Begin each proof with the proof technique** ("By induction on N", "We construct a coupling...", "By contradiction, assume...")
3. **End each proof with a clear marker** (∎ or □)
4. **Connect proofs to intuition**: Before a long proof, give a one-sentence intuitive explanation
5. **All proofs in the main body must be self-contained**; do not reference appendix derivations from body proofs

---

## Algorithm and Solution Method Presentation

See [references/algorithm-solving-guide.md](references/algorithm-solving-guide.md) for comprehensive guidance.

### Pseudocode Standards
- Use the `algorithm2e` or `algorithmicx` LaTeX packages
- Every algorithm must have: input, output, and numbered steps
- Include **computational complexity** (worst-case time and space) for every algorithm
- If applicable, state **approximation ratio** and **tightness**

### Algorithm vs. Heuristic
- **Algorithm**: Provable optimality or approximation guarantee → label as "Algorithm"
- **Heuristic**: No theoretical guarantee, validated numerically → label as "Heuristic" or "Solution Procedure"
- C&IE and IJPR accept pure heuristics; MS/OR expect optimality or approximation guarantees

---

## Numerical Experiment Design

See [references/numerical-experiments.md](references/numerical-experiments.md) for comprehensive guidance.

### Standard Experiment Structure
1. **Experimental Setup** (§X.1): Hardware, software, solver versions, random seeds
2. **Parameter Settings** (§X.2): Table of all parameters with default values and justification
3. **Benchmark Instances** (§X.3): Data source, generation method, instance sizes
4. **Main Results** (§X.4): Performance comparison tables with statistical tests
5. **Sensitivity Analysis** (§X.5): One-at-a-time or factorial design varying key parameters
6. **Managerial Implications of Experiments** (§X.6): What the numbers mean for practice

### MS&E-Specific Experiment Requirements

| Requirement | MS/OR | MSOM/POM | EJOR/IJPE | C&IE/IJPR |
|-------------|-------|----------|-----------|-----------|
| Real data instances | Preferred | Required | Strongly preferred | Optional |
| Statistical tests | Yes | Yes | Preferred | Optional |
| Sensitivity analysis | Required | Required | Required | Preferred |
| CPU time reporting | Required | Optional | Required | Required |
| Benchmark comparison | Required | Required | Required | Required |
| Instance size variety | Required | Required | Required | Required |
| Parameter justification | Required | Required | Required | Optional |

## Managerial Insights

See [references/managerial-insights.md](references/managerial-insights.md) for comprehensive guidance.

This is the **most distinctive feature** of MS&E papers. Managerial Insights (MIs) translate mathematical results into actionable business recommendations.

### MI Structure
Each managerial insight should follow the **SAR format**:
- **Setting**: Remind the reader of the context
- **Analytical finding**: State the mathematical result in plain language
- **Recommendation**: What a manager should DO differently

### MI Checklist
- [ ] Each MI is traceable to a specific theorem, proposition, or numerical result
- [ ] MIs use **zero mathematical notation**
- [ ] MIs are numbered for clarity (Managerial Insight 1, 2, 3...)
- [ ] Counterintuitive findings are explicitly highlighted
- [ ] Boundary conditions ("this insight holds only when...") are stated
- [ ] At least one MI connects to a real company or industry context

**Journals requiring mandatory MI**: MS, MSOM, OMEGA (critical), POM, IJPE.
**Journals where MI is optional but valued**: OR, TS, DS, EJOR.

---

## Writing Patterns

### Pattern 1: The Motivating Example
Open the introduction with a concrete mini-case from industry. Cite a real company, real numbers, real dilemma. This grounds the abstract model in practice. **Required by MS, MSOM, OMEGA.**

### Pattern 2: The Gap Table
Use a structured table comparing your paper against 8-12 key references on dimensions like: modeling approach, demand model, solution method, numerical validation, managerial insights. Explicitly mark your contribution. **Standard for MS, OR, EJOR.**

### Pattern 3: The Assumption-Relaxation Ladder
Present the base model → analyze → relax one assumption → re-analyze → relax another → re-analyze. Demonstrates robustness of the core insight. **Standard for MS, OR.**

### Pattern 4: The SAR Managerial Insight
Each MI is a self-contained mini-section: Setting → Analytical Finding → Recommendation. See [Managerial Insights](#managerial-insights) above.

## Venue-Specific Page Budgets

| Journal | Typical Submission Length | References | Appendix | Abstract Word Limit |
|---------|--------------------------|------------|----------|---------------------|
| MS | 38 pages | Unlimited | Unlimited | 200 |
| OR | 35 pages | Unlimited | Unlimited | 200 |

## Cross-Referencing with Other Skills

This skill works with:
- **scientific-writing**: General IMRAD principles, clarity, citation formatting
- **literature-review**: Systematic literature search for MS&E topics
- **ppw:polish**: English polishing for non-native speakers (common in MS&E)
- **matlab** / **sympy**: For deriving and verifying mathematical results

---

## Common Rejection Reasons in MS&E Journals

| Reason | Frequency | Prevention |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| Insufficient contribution over existing literature | Very High | Explicit gap table in introduction |
| Unrealistic or undefended assumptions | High | Assumption defense section + relaxation |
| Managerial insights too generic | High | Specific, numbered, traceable to results |
| Numerical experiments not reproducible | Medium | Provide code, data, parameter justification |
| Proof errors or incomplete derivation | Medium | Have a colleague verify the proof chain |
| Poor motivation — why should anyone care? | High | Real-world motivating example |
| Wrong journal fit | Medium | Use the journal selection guide above |
| Paper too long for contribution size | Medium | Respect page budgets; move to appendix |

### Pipeline Interaction Protocol

When the user invokes this skill, the agent should:

1. **Determine the current stage**: Ask what the user has so far (idea only? model built? results in hand?)
2. **Start at the appropriate stage**: Don't force users back to Stage 1 if they're ready for Stage 4
3. **At each stage**: Load the relevant reference file, then execute the agent actions
4. **Stage gate**: Confirm with user before proceeding to the next stage
5. **Iterate within stage**: Draft → get feedback → revise until the stage exit criteria are met

### Quick-Start Prompts

Users can jump to any stage:

- "I have a research idea about [topic]. Help me position it and pick a journal." → Stage 1
- "I have my model formulated. Help me derive structural properties." → Stage 3
- "I have analytical results. Help me design numerical experiments." → Stage 4
- "I have all my results. Help me write the full paper for MS." → Stage 5
- "Take me through the full pipeline from scratch." → Stage 1 → 5
