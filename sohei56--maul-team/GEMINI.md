```

## Technologies

- **Shell**: Bash 3.2+ (macOS/Linux compatible)
- **Python**: 3.9+ with Textual 8.x (TUI), watchdog (filesystem monitoring)
- **Agents/Skills**: Markdown with YAML frontmatter
- **State**: JSON files in `.scrum/` directory
- **CLI**: Claude Code with Agent Teams (`CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1`)

## Commands

```bash
# Run tests (-r is required: tests/unit/ has subdirectories, and a
# non-recursive run silently skips them)
bats -r tests/unit/ tests/lint/

# Lint shell scripts
shellcheck scrum-start.sh scripts/*.sh scripts/lib/*.sh scripts/scrum/*.sh scripts/scrum/lib/*.sh scripts/scrum/migrations/*.sh scripts/autonomous/*.sh scripts/autonomous/lib/*.sh hooks/*.sh hooks/lib/*.sh

# Lint/format Python
ruff check dashboard/
ruff format dashboard/

# Install dev dependencies
sh scripts/setup-dev.sh

# Launch the Scrum team (in target project directory).
# Full setup walkthrough + autonomous-mode flags are canonical in
# docs/quickstart.md and docs/autonomous-mode.md — not duplicated here.
sh /path/to/maul-team/scrum-start.sh
```

## Code Style

- **Shell**: POSIX-compatible Bash 3.2+, `set -euo pipefail`, shellcheck clean
- **Python**: Ruff-formatted, type hints, 4-space indent
- **Markdown**: 2-space indent for YAML frontmatter, 80-char line width for prose
- **JSON**: 2-space indent
- **Commits**: Conventional Commits format (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `refactor:`, `chore:`)

## Output discipline

Applies to work **on this repository**. The same rules for the Scrum
team this framework spawns are canonical in
[`rules/scrum-context.md`](rules/scrum-context.md) § Output discipline,
which is deployed to every agent — keep the two in sync rather than
re-stating one inside the other.

- **Responses.** Lead with the outcome, then detail. No preamble
  restating the request, no closing recap of what was just said.
  Keep caveats to a clause. When asked to explain, give the
  high-level answer unless depth was specifically requested.
- **Progress narration.** One sentence before the first tool call;
  after that, speak only on an important finding or a change of
  direction. Do not announce each tool call or each file read.
- **Docs and Markdown authored here** (`docs/**`, `agents/*.md`,
  `skills/**/SKILL.md`, `rules/*.md`, `README*`). This repo's
  instruction surface is loaded into every agent's context, so length
  is a running cost, not a one-off. Prefer a pointer to the canonical
  section over a restatement of it; a fact belongs in exactly one
  file. Cover the substance without filler sections, redundant
  summaries, or headings kept only to look complete.
- **Brevity governs prose, never coverage.** Never drop a finding, a
  test case, an edge case, or a required section to be shorter.

## Key Conventions

- Scrum Master agent operates in **Delegate mode** — coordinates only, never writes code
- All state persisted to `.scrum/` JSON files for resume capability
- Design documents governed by `docs/design/catalog.md` (read-only type reference) + `docs/design/catalog-config.json` (editable enabled list)
- Developer teammates named with Sprint suffix: `dev-001-s{N}`
- PBI status flow (13 values, actor-split; status is sole SSOT):
  SM-managed lifecycle statuses plus Developer-managed
  `in_progress_*` pipeline statuses. `cancelled` is the SM-only
  terminal state for PBIs merged into another PBI or no longer
  needed (incl. escalation `abandon`); `blocked` remains strictly
  hold-and-resume on an external blocker. Full enum + graph
  (including failure edges): `docs/data-model.md` § State Transitions
- Sprint status flow: `planning → active → cross_review → sprint_review → complete | failed` (`failed` is a terminal failure state allowed by `sprint.schema.json`)
- On a **new project (both modes)**, `scrum-start.sh` co-authors a
  product brief (`docs/product/brief.md`) as an interactive pre-flight
  **before** Requirement Definition — the brief anchors the interview
  (the Requirements Analyst reconciles any brief↔requirements conflict
  per a PO-seat decision) and is a pre-ceremony input, not a
  `state.json.phase` value. TTY / abort rules + full flow:
  [`skills/create-brief/SKILL.md`](skills/create-brief/SKILL.md).
- Project workflow flow (`state.json.phase`, distinct from PBI
  status): `new → requirements_sprint → backlog_created →
  sprint_planning → pbi_pipeline_active → review → sprint_review →
  retrospective → backlog_created (next Sprint) | integration_sprint
  → uat_release → complete`. The `retrospective → {backlog_created |
  integration_sprint | complete}` edge is chosen by a PO
  `sprint_continuation` decision in autonomous mode (the decision's
  `choice:integration_sprint` label is unchanged even though the
  phase graph beyond it now runs through `uat_release`); in human
  mode the user drives it. Full graph including failure routing:
  `docs/data-model.md` § State Transitions; the integration-entry
  thin `codebase-audit` re-check conditions:
  `skills/codebase-audit/SKILL.md`.
- PBI development flows through the `pbi-pipeline` skill: the
  Developer is a conductor that spawns specialized sub-agents per
  Round (design → impl+UT → review). State per PBI lives at
  `.scrum/pbi/<pbi-id>/`. Design includes a mandatory
  library-selection web search recorded as `S-070` specs, gated by
  `codex-design-reviewer` — see
  `skills/pbi-pipeline/references/design-stage.md`.
  UT is black-box (UT author cannot read impl
  source). Termination is deterministic via composite gates
  (success/stagnation/divergence/hard cap). Coverage measured by real
  tooling (C0/C1 100% by default; partial-C1 languages declare relaxed
  threshold in `.scrum/config.json`).
- `backlog.json items[].kind ∈ {code, docs}` (default `code`) splits
  the pipeline. **kind=code** runs the full pipeline above.
  **kind=docs** (every added/modified/renamed **or deleted** path in
  `base..HEAD` must be `*.md`) skips Design and the
  entire UT pipeline — only `pbi-implementer` + `codex-impl-reviewer`
  run — and its per-PBI Integrity stage runs aspects 1 (req-conformance)
  and 5 (docs-consistency) only (after impl-review PASS). `kind` is set
  by `backlog-refinement` and machine-enforced at ready-to-merge
  (violation → `escalated(kind_mismatch)`). Full flow:
  `skills/pbi-pipeline/SKILL.md` § Stages + `docs/data-model.md`
  § kind=docs override.
- PBIs are **vertical slices** (one user experience / capability
  extension end-to-end — never component splits of one experience),
  with a walking-skeleton-first rule per feature epic and a mandatory
  local `demo_plan` for kind=code (`update-backlog-status.sh` refuses
  `→refined` while it is empty). Canonical:
  `skills/backlog-refinement/SKILL.md` Steps 3.a–3.c2.
- `po_mode` selects the PO seat. Absent or `"human"` → the user
  (default). `"agent"` → the `product-owner` teammate (FR-023).
  Skills do not branch on mode; every "ask the user" prompt resolves
  to a `PO_DECISION_REQUEST` to the PO teammate in agent mode. See
  `rules/scrum-context.md` § PO seat resolution and
  `agents/product-owner.md`. A **non-autonomous** `scrum-start.sh`
  (no `--autonomous`) resets a leftover `po_mode=agent` in
  `.scrum/config.json` back to `"human"` at launch, so a normal
  start after a prior autonomous run does not silently re-spawn the
  PO teammate; the `.autonomous.*` tuning block is preserved.
- Autonomous mode (`scrum-start.sh --autonomous`) drives the team
  end-to-end without human input via the outer watchdog loop
  (`scripts/autonomous/watchdog.sh`). Run state lives in
  `.scrum/autonomy.json`, PO decisions in `.scrum/po/decisions.json`
  (append-only, via `append-po-decision.sh`), and reports in
  `.scrum/reports/`. Safety valves, rate-limit auto-resume behavior,
  and the morning report: `docs/autonomous-mode.md`.
- **Stop-hook block policy diverges by mode.** One Stop entry
  (`hooks/stop-dispatch.sh` → `dashboard-event.sh` best-effort →
  `completion-gate.sh`). Autonomous mode blocks unbounded on
  `pipeline_in_flight` and routes bounded exit-criteria blocks
  through a per-phase budget breaker; human mode uses
  fingerprint-dedup plus the external `scripts/stall-watchdog.sh`
  daemon. Full policy: `docs/contracts/agent-interfaces.md` § Stop Hook.

## State management

`.scrum/*.json` writes go through `.scrum/scripts/*.sh` wrappers
(deployed by `setup-user.sh` from this repo's `scripts/scrum/` source).
Direct edits are blocked by `hooks/pre-tool-use-scrum-state-guard.sh`
(registered as `PreToolUse`). Schemas under
`docs/contracts/scrum-state/` are the SSOT. See
`docs/MIGRATION-scrum-state-tools.md` for the wrapper map, the
v1→v2 status migration history, and known gaps. Some runtime files
are written **without** a `.scrum/scripts/*.sh` wrapper because
they are hot-path bookkeeping rather than agent state — for
example, `.scrum/stop-gate.json`, the Stop-hook dedup ledger
written by `hooks/lib/stop-gate-state.sh` (human mode only; schema
`stop-gate.schema.json`), `.scrum/attention.json` (+ its
`attention-context.json` sidecar), the "Claude is waiting for the
human" flag written by `hooks/notification-attention.sh` on
Notification / Stop / UserPromptSubmit for an external UI to poll,
`.scrum/runtime.json`, which records
the tmux session, the SM pane id, and the stall-watchdog PID
written by `scrum-start.sh` (consumed by
`scripts/stall-watchdog.sh`), and `.scrum/deploy-stamp.json`,
which records the framework revision `setup-user.sh` deployed the
wrappers/schemas from (staleness diagnosis). The canonical
file-by-file writer
enumeration lives in `docs/contracts/scrum-state/README.md`.
Framework upgrades are made safe by the launch-time gate: on every
`scrum-start.sh` launch, `migrate-state.sh` runs all idempotent
migrations (`scripts/scrum/migrations/NNN-*.sh`) and validates
existing `.scrum/*.json` against the freshly-deployed schemas,
hard-failing before the team spawns; a breaking schema change must
ship its migration in the same commit. See
`docs/MIGRATION-scrum-state-tools.md` § State migrations & upgrade
safety. These
files still match the guard's `.scrum/**/*.json` pattern, but their
writers run outside agent tool calls (hook process / launcher
script), so the guard never intercepts them; agents editing these
files via Bash are blocked as usual. The PBI state schema
gained worktree / merge fields (`branch`, `worktree`, `base_sha`,
`head_sha`, `paths_touched`, `ready_at`, `merged_sha`, `merged_at`,
`merge_failure`, `merge_failure_count`); all PBI lifecycle is driven
by the 13-value `backlog.json.items[].status` enum. Merge-failure
detail is preserved in `pbi-state.json.merge_failure` /
`escalation_reason`; see `skills/pbi-merge/SKILL.md` for the
`merge_failure.kind → escalation_reason` mapping and the 3-strike
rule. The sprint schema gained `base_sha` and `base_sha_captured_at`.

## Git workflow

PBI development uses one git worktree per PBI. The Scrum Master
captures `sprint.base_sha = git rev-parse HEAD` once at Sprint
start, then creates `.scrum/worktrees/<pbi-id>/` checked out at
branch `pbi/<pbi-id>` forked from that base. Each worktree shares
the `.scrum/` SSOT with the main repo via a symlink.

Developers commit only via `.scrum/scripts/commit-pbi.sh` (which
refuses if the checked-out branch is not `pbi/<id>`). On PBI
completion they run `.scrum/scripts/mark-pbi-ready-to-merge.sh`
and notify SM `[<pbi-id>] PBI_READY_TO_MERGE`.

During the Integration Sprint, test assets written to the target
project's main worktree (`tests/integration/`, `tests/e2e/`,
`tests/stubs/`) are committed via
`.scrum/scripts/commit-integration-tests.sh` — the sole sanctioned
path, which refuses unless phase is `integration_sprint` and the
current branch is not a `pbi/*` worktree branch, stages only the
test-asset directories (plus repeatable `--allow <path>` exceptions
for runner config), and blocks the commit if any product-source path
is staged.

SM merges per-PBI immediately by running the `pbi-merge` skill —
the full protocol (merge-scoped clean check, failure matrix,
3-strike escalation) is canonical in
[skills/pbi-merge/SKILL.md](skills/pbi-merge/SKILL.md).
The Sprint-end whole-repo audit (static analysis + 4-axis
`codebase-audit`) still runs in `cross-review`.

In **deployed target projects** (registered via `setup-user.sh`), the
hook `pre-tool-use-no-branch-ops.sh` scans each shell statement segment
(splitting on `&&`, `||`, `;`, `|`, newlines) and blocks raw `git
checkout -b`, `switch -c`, `branch <new>`, `merge`, `push`, `rebase`,
and `worktree add -b` from the Bash tool unless the command is a lone
`.scrum/scripts/*.sh` wrapper invocation — "lone" is decided
quoting-blind, so a wrapper argument containing `&&`/`||`/`;`/`|`
(e.g. a commit message) forfeits the allowlist (this is a guardrail against
honest mistakes, not a sandbox against obfuscated commands). The framework repo
itself does **not** register this hook (see `.claude/settings.json`)
so that framework dev work — branching, merging, pushing — proceeds
normally. The same scope applies to other PreToolUse guards shipped
with the framework (`status-gate.sh`, `pre-tool-use-path-guard.sh`):
they protect downstream target projects, not this repo. The one
exception is `pre-tool-use-scrum-state-guard.sh`, which **is**
registered in the framework's own `.claude/settings.json` because
this repo also writes to `.scrum/` during integration tests.
