# Autonomous Agents Documentation

This repository uses **autonomous agents** that run 24/7 to manage deployments, monitor health, and maintain the codebase.

## Overview

Two primary agents operate continuously:

1. **Schedule Enforcement Agent** - Ensures all deployments occur during the approved time window
2. **Monitoring & Maintenance Agent** - Monitors health, fixes issues, and manages updates

## Agent 1: Schedule Enforcement Agent

### Purpose
Enforces strict deployment schedules to ensure all pushes, releases, and deployments occur only during the approved time window.

### Schedule
- **Runs:** Every 5 minutes (24/7)
- **Workflow:** `.github/workflows/schedule-enforcement-agent.yml`

### Deployment Window
**ALLOWED:** 10:00 PM - 8:00 AM EST
**BLOCKED:** 8:00 AM - 10:00 PM EST

### Features
- ✅ Checks all deployment workflows for schedule compliance
- ✅ Blocks deployments outside the allowed window
- ✅ Monitors recent workflow runs for violations
- ✅ Generates violation reports
- ✅ Provides real-time status updates
- ✅ Heartbeat monitoring to confirm agent is running

### Actions Taken
1. **Pre-deployment Check:** Every deployment workflow first checks if current time is within the window
2. **Block on Violation:** Exits with error code 1 if deployment attempted outside window
3. **Generate Reports:** Creates violation reports in `agent-reports/` directory
4. **Status Updates:** Updates `.github/agent-status/schedule-enforcement.txt` every 5 minutes

### How It Works
```bash
# Check if within deployment window (10 PM - 8 AM EST)
CURRENT_HOUR=$(TZ='America/New_York' date +%H)

# Hours 22-23 (10 PM - 11:59 PM) OR 0-7 (12 AM - 7:59 AM) = ALLOWED
# Hours 8-21 (8 AM - 9:59 PM) = BLOCKED

if [ "$CURRENT_HOUR" -ge 22 ] || [ "$CURRENT_HOUR" -lt 8 ]; then
  echo "✅ Within deployment window - Proceeding"
else
  echo "🚫 BLOCKED: Outside deployment window"
  exit 1
fi
```

### Modified Workflows
All deployment workflows now include schedule enforcement:
- `publish-vscode-extension.yml`
- `vscode-extension-ci.yml` (publish job)
- `vscode-extension-release.yml`

### Monitoring
Check agent status at any time:
- **Status File:** `.github/agent-status/schedule-enforcement.txt`
- **Violation Reports:** `agent-reports/violation-*.md`
- **GitHub Actions:** View runs of "Schedule Enforcement Agent (24x7)"

---

## Agent 2: Monitoring & Maintenance Agent

### Purpose
Continuously monitors the extension and plugin, automatically fixes issues, manages updates, and responds to user reports.

### Schedule

### Actions Taken

#### Automatic Fixes (Staged for Deployment Window)
All automated fixes respect the deployment schedule:
```bash
CURRENT_HOUR=$(TZ='America/New_York' date +%H)
if [ "$CURRENT_HOUR" -ge 22 ] || [ "$CURRENT_HOUR" -lt 8 ]; then
  git push  # Push immediately during window
else
  echo "⏰ Staged for deployment window (10 PM - 8 AM EST)"
fi
```

#### Compilation Failure Response
```bash
1. Detects compilation failure
2. Removes node_modules and out directories
3. Reinstalls dependencies (npm install)
4. Recompiles (npm run compile)
5. If successful: Commits and pushes fix
6. If failed: Creates issue for manual review
```

#### Security Vulnerability Response
```bash
1. Detects vulnerabilities via npm audit
2. Runs npm audit fix
3. Tests compilation after fix
4. If successful: Commits and stages for deployment window
5. If failed: Creates high-priority issue
```

#### Issue Auto-Response
When a new issue is opened:
- **Bug reports:** Auto-labels, provides troubleshooting steps, triages
- **Feature requests:** Auto-labels, explains review process, gathers feedback
- **Questions:** Provides links to documentation

### Monitoring

## Agent Status Monitoring

### Real-Time Status
Both agents update heartbeat files every run:

```bash
# Schedule Enforcement Agent
cat .github/agent-status/schedule-enforcement.txt
# Output: Schedule Enforcement Agent: ACTIVE - 2025-10-13 22:45:00 EST

# Maintenance Agent
cat .github/agent-status/maintenance-agent.txt
# Output: Monitoring & Maintenance Agent: ACTIVE - 2025-10-13 22:50:00 EST
```

### Check if Agents are Running
```bash
# View recent workflow runs
gh run list --workflow="Schedule Enforcement Agent (24x7)" --limit 5
gh run list --workflow="Monitoring & Maintenance Agent (24x7)" --limit 5
```

### View Agent Logs
```bash
# Get latest run ID
RUN_ID=$(gh run list --workflow="Schedule Enforcement Agent (24x7)" --limit 1 --json databaseId --jq '.[0].databaseId')

# View logs
gh run view $RUN_ID --log
```

---

## Schedule Configuration

### Current Schedule

| Time (EST) | Deployments | Agents Running |
|------------|-------------|----------------|
| 10:00 PM - 11:59 PM | ✅ ALLOWED | ✅ Active |
| 12:00 AM - 7:59 AM | ✅ ALLOWED | ✅ Active |
| 8:00 AM - 9:59 PM | 🚫 BLOCKED | ✅ Active |

### Modifying the Schedule

To change the deployment window, update the time check in these files:

1. `.github/workflows/schedule-enforcement-agent.yml`
2. `.github/workflows/publish-vscode-extension.yml`
3. `.github/workflows/vscode-extension-ci.yml`
4. `.github/workflows/vscode-extension-release.yml`
5. `.github/workflows/monitoring-maintenance-agent.yml`

Find this block and modify the hour checks:
```bash
CURRENT_HOUR=$(TZ='America/New_York' date +%H)

# Change these numbers to adjust window
# Currently: 22 (10 PM) to 8 (8 AM)
if [ "$CURRENT_HOUR" -ge 22 ] || [ "$CURRENT_HOUR" -lt 8 ]; then
  # ALLOWED
else
  # BLOCKED
fi
```

---

## Manual Overrides

### Force Deployment Outside Window (Emergency Only)
If you absolutely must deploy outside the schedule:

```bash
# Option 1: Workflow dispatch with manual approval
gh workflow run publish-vscode-extension.yml

# Option 2: Temporarily disable schedule check
# Edit workflow file and comment out the schedule check step
```

**⚠️ WARNING:** This should only be used for critical hotfixes!

### Disable an Agent
To temporarily disable an agent:

```bash
# Option 1: Disable via GitHub UI
# Go to: Actions → [Agent Name] → ... → Disable workflow

# Option 2: Delete/rename workflow file
mv .github/workflows/schedule-enforcement-agent.yml \
   .github/workflows/schedule-enforcement-agent.yml.disabled
```

## Troubleshooting

### Agent Not Running
1. **Check workflow status:**
   ```bash
   gh workflow list
   ```

2. **View recent runs:**
   ```bash
   gh run list --workflow="Schedule Enforcement Agent (24x7)"
   ```

3. **Check for disabled workflows:**
   - Go to GitHub → Actions → Select workflow → Check if enabled

### Agent Failing
1. **View failure logs:**
   ```bash
   gh run view [RUN_ID] --log
   ```

2. **Common issues:**
   - Missing `GITHUB_TOKEN` permissions
   - Rate limiting from GitHub API
   - Git push conflicts

3. **Fix:**
   - Ensure repository has proper permissions
   - Wait for rate limit reset
   - Pull latest changes and retry

### False Positive Violations
If schedule enforcement is blocking valid deployments:

1. **Check your local timezone:**
   ```bash
   TZ='America/New_York' date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %Z'
   ```

2. **Verify deployment window logic**
3. **Check agent logs for time calculations**
