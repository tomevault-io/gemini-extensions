# CLAUDE.md — Project Intelligence for TGMA Platform

## Project Overview
TGMA (Tripura Gut Microbiome in Adolescents) — Flask 3.1 research data management platform.
ICMR-funded study at Tripura University. Self-hosted on Dell PowerEdge R730, LAN-only, Docker deployment.

**Status (April 2026)**: Platform is **feature-complete**. 65+ source files, 44 tests passing, Docker deployment ready. Features: KoboToolbox sync, participant edit/delete UI, demo-data wipe script, label-kit batched reprint (Seznik thermal printer), per-participant Document Vault (consent/assent/info-sheet/questionnaire/photos, PDF+JPG+PNG, role-gated upload/delete).

## Deployment
- **Server**: PowerEdge R730, Ubuntu, Docker Compose at `/home/mmilab/Desktop/tgma-platform`
- **Access (LAN)**: http://192.168.1.35:8100
- **Access (public)**: ngrok HTTPS tunnel — URL changes on restart; get current URL with `sudo docker compose logs ngrok | grep url=` or run `bash scripts/ngrok_url.sh` from the server
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 16 in Docker, volume `tgma-platform_pgdata`
- **Rebuild flow**: `git pull && sudo docker compose down && sudo docker compose up -d --build`
- **Re-seed / upsert users**: `sudo docker compose exec web python scripts/init_db.py`
- **Re-seed with synthetic data**: `sudo docker compose exec web python scripts/init_db.py --synthetic`
- **Wipe demo data (keeps users + schema)**: `sudo docker compose exec web python scripts/wipe_data.py --confirm` — deletes all participants (cascades), ID allocations, and KoboSync logs
- **Full reset (wipes data)**: add `-v` flag to `docker compose down`
- **Dev machine**: Windows (Anaconda), run with `conda run -n base python`
- **Ngrok setup (one-time)**: Sign up at ngrok.com, add `NGROK_AUTHTOKEN=<token>` to `.env` on server, then rebuild

## Build Verification

## Mistakes Log — Do NOT Repeat

### 1. SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE on HTTP
**What happened**: Set `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = True` in ProductionConfig. This caused CSRF "session token missing" errors because the cookie was only sent over HTTPS, but the server runs plain HTTP on LAN.
**Fix**: Set `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = False` for LAN-only HTTP deployment.
**Rule**: Never enable secure cookies unless HTTPS is configured.

### 2. Special characters in DATABASE_URL password
**What happened**: DB_PASSWORD in `.env` contained `&`, `%`, `@` characters. Docker Compose interpolated these into `DATABASE_URL`, breaking URL parsing. psycopg2 saw `E&%u@db` as hostname.
**Fix**: Use only alphanumeric passwords in `.env` (no `@`, `&`, `%`, `#`, `=`).
**Rule**: Always use simple alphanumeric passwords for database URLs in environment variables.

### 3. Dockerfile apt-get failures on slim images
**What happened**: `apt-get update` failed with exit code 100 inside `python:3.12-slim` when installing WeasyPrint dependencies (libpango, libpangocairo, etc.).
**Fix**: Removed WeasyPrint deps (not needed yet), kept only `libpq-dev` and `gcc` for psycopg2.
**Rule**: Keep Dockerfile dependencies minimal. Only add system packages that are actively needed.

### 4. Inline grep in Dockerfile RUN
**What happened**: `RUN pip install --no-cache-dir $(grep -v WeasyPrint requirements.txt)` failed because shell expansion inside Docker RUN doesn't work as expected with multiline output.
**Fix**: Split into two commands: `grep > reqs.txt && pip install -r reqs.txt`.
**Rule**: Never use command substitution `$(...)` with pip install in Dockerfiles. Write to temp file first.

### 5. PostgreSQL init.sql referencing non-existent tables
**What happened**: `init_db.sql` creates a trigram index on `participants` table, but this runs during DB initialization before Flask creates the tables. Caused the DB container to be marked "unhealthy".
**Fix**: The error is harmless (DB still starts), but the healthcheck timed out on first run. Just restart.
**Rule**: Don't put table-dependent SQL in `docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/`. Run indexes after `db.create_all()`.

### 6. Duplicate freezer positions in synthetic data
**What happened**: Random freezer position generation (rack/shelf/box/row/col) created collisions, violating the UNIQUE constraint `uq_samples_freezer_position`.
**Fix**: Track used positions in a `set()` and retry until unique.
**Rule**: Always track uniqueness when generating random data for columns with UNIQUE constraints.

### 7. conda multiline argument on Windows
**What happened**: `conda run -n base python -c "..."` with multiline Python code fails on Windows with "Support for scripts where arguments contain newlines not implemented."
**Fix**: Write Python code to a `.py` file and run it, or use single-line `-c` commands.
**Rule**: Never use multiline strings with `conda run` on Windows.

### 8. GitHub password auth rejected
**What happened**: Tried `git clone` with username/password on the server. GitHub no longer accepts passwords.
**Fix**: Made repo public temporarily for cloning, or use Personal Access Token.
**Rule**: Use PAT tokens or SSH keys for GitHub auth. Never attempt password auth.

### 9. Docker port conflicts on shared server
**What happened**: Original `docker-compose.yml` bound PostgreSQL to port 5432 and Nginx to 80/443 — all already in use by other services.
**Fix**: Removed bundled nginx, removed DB port binding (internal only), exposed web on configurable `WEB_PORT` (8100).
**Rule**: Always check existing port usage (`docker ps`) before binding. Never assume standard ports are free on shared servers.

### 10. git clone into non-empty directory
**What happened**: `git clone <url>` without `.` created a subdirectory instead of cloning into current dir. User then couldn't find `.env.example`.
**Rule**: Use `git clone <url> .` to clone into current directory. Verify with `ls` after clone.

### 11. Read tool required before Write on existing files
**What happened**: Claude Code Write tool rejects writes to files that haven't been read first in the session, even for new content.
**Rule**: Always Read a file before attempting to Write/Edit it, even if you know the contents.

### 12. Context window exhaustion during large builds
**What happened**: Building 54+ files in a single session repeatedly hit context limits, requiring session continuations.
**Rule**: For large multi-file builds, create files in parallel batches and commit frequently. Use the plan file to track progress across sessions.

### 13. Test assertion against wrong validation layer
**What happened**: Wrote a test expecting a "gender" error message, but the tracking_id regex `TGMA-(WT|ST|DL)-(M|F)-(\d{3,4})` rejected the ID first (before gender validation ran). Test failed with "Invalid format" instead of "gender".
**Fix**: Updated test to assert `error is not None` instead of checking for a specific error substring.
**Rule**: When writing validation tests, understand the validation order. If field A is validated before field B, a test for field B rejection must use input that passes field A first. The tracking_id regex enforces gender (M|F) at the format level — there's no separate gender rejection path for IDs with invalid gender codes.

### 14. ETL script as CLI-only, not importable
**What happened**: Original `etl/kobo_sync.py` was a CLI-only script with `main()` that created its own app context. Couldn't be called from a Flask route without duplicating logic.
**Fix**: Refactored into an importable `run_sync(app, triggered_by, full_sync)` function that accepts an app instance. CLI `main()` just calls `run_sync()`. Route handler also calls `run_sync()`.
**Rule**: Always design ETL/sync scripts as importable modules with a public function. The CLI entry point should be a thin wrapper. This lets both UI routes and CLI share the same logic without duplication.

### 15. Upsert clobbering existing data with NULLs
**What happened**: When a KoboToolbox form has optional sections (e.g., anthropometrics left empty), the sync would overwrite existing non-NULL values with NULL on re-sync.
**Fix**: Upsert logic only sets attributes where the new value `is not None`. Also skip creating related records (anthro, lifestyle, env) entirely if ALL their fields are NULL.
**Rule**: In upsert logic, never overwrite existing data with NULL. Only update fields that have actual values. Check `any(v is not None for v in data.values())` before creating related records for optional sections.

### 16. Importing from parent directory in route handlers
**What happened**: The kobo route needed to import `run_sync` from `etl/kobo_sync.py` which lives outside the Flask app package.
**Fix**: Used `sys.path.insert(0, ...)` inside the route function to add the project root, then imported `from etl.kobo_sync import run_sync`.
**Rule**: When importing from outside the app package (e.g., `etl/`), add project root to `sys.path` at import time. This is acceptable for a LAN-only deployment. For cleaner architecture, consider moving shared logic into the app package.

### 17. New model table missing on deployed server (500 Internal Server Error)
**What happened**: Added `KoboSyncLog` model with `kobo_sync_log` table locally, committed, and pushed. On the deployed server, the Docker container was rebuilt but `db.create_all()` was not re-run — so the table didn't exist. Visiting `/kobo/` caused a 500 error because SQLAlchemy tried to query a non-existent table.
**Fix**: Added `_ensure_table()` helper in the kobo route that uses `sqlalchemy.inspect(db.engine).has_table('kobo_sync_log')` and creates it on-the-fly if missing. This makes the route self-healing on first access after deploy.
**Rule**: When adding a new model/table, always handle the case where the deployed DB doesn't have it yet. Either: (a) add auto-create logic in the route, (b) use Flask-Migrate (`flask db migrate && flask db upgrade`), or (c) document that `init_db.py` must be re-run. Never assume `db.create_all()` has run for new tables on the server.

### 18. Nested app context crash when calling ETL from Flask route
**What happened**: `run_sync()` used `with app.app_context():` unconditionally. When called from a Flask route (which already has an app context), this created a nested context. On exit, it popped the outer request context too, causing the returned `sync_log` object to become detached from the session → 500 Internal Server Error.
**Fix**: Split into `_do_sync()` (core logic, no context management) and `run_sync()` (wrapper that checks `flask.has_app_context()` — if already in context, calls directly; if CLI, pushes a new one). Also wrapped the route handler in try/except so errors flash a message instead of returning a raw 500.
**Rule**: Never unconditionally push `app.app_context()` in functions that may be called from both CLI and Flask routes. Use `flask.has_app_context()` to detect if a context already exists. Always wrap route-triggered operations in try/except to show user-friendly error messages.

### 19. `Query.delete()` bypasses ORM cascade rules
**What happened**: When writing the `wipe_data.py` reset script, the obvious-looking `Participant.query.delete()` would have left orphaned rows in `samples`, `hormone_results`, `anthropometrics`, etc. SQLAlchemy `Query.delete()` is a bulk SQL DELETE that does NOT trigger Python-side cascade rules defined on relationships.
**Fix**: Iterate `Participant.query.all()` and call `db.session.delete(p)` per row so the `cascade='all, delete-orphan'` paths in `app/models/participant.py:80-95` actually fire.
**Rule**: Whenever a model has `cascade='all, delete-orphan'` relationships, never use `Query.delete()` to remove rows — always iterate and `db.session.delete()` per object. `Query.delete()` is fine only for tables with no Python-side cascades (e.g., `IdAllocation`, `KoboSyncLog`).

### 20. URL path segments joined into filesystem paths without validation
**What happened**: When building the Document Vault upload route, `tracking_id` flows from a URL path parameter straight into `os.path.join(UPLOAD_FOLDER, 'participants', tracking_id, doc_type)`. Even though Flask route converters give you a string, nothing stops a caller from sending a percent-encoded `../` sequence that `os.path.join` will happily normalize into an escape from the uploads volume.
**Fix**: Call `validate_tracking_id()` from `app/utils/helpers.py` at the top of every route that uses a `tracking_id` to build a filesystem path. The regex `^TGMA-(WT|ST|DL)-(M|F)-(\d{3,4})$` rejects anything with slashes, dots, or percent-encoded escapes.
**Rule**: Never concatenate a URL path parameter into a filesystem path without validating it against a strict regex first. Apply this to *any* user-controlled string used in `os.path.join`/`open`/`send_file`, not just tracking IDs. Also cascade-delete orphaned files from disk in wipe scripts — DB cascade does not clean up the filesystem (see `scripts/wipe_data.py` which `shutil.rmtree`s the `participants/` upload subtree).

### 21. `scripts/` not in `sys.path` when run inside Docker container
**What happened**: `docker compose exec web python scripts/wipe_data.py` raised `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'app'` because the script lives at `/app/scripts/wipe_data.py` and Python looks for `app` relative to the script directory (`/app/scripts/`), not the working directory (`/app/`).
**Fix**: Add `sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), '..')))` at the top of the script — identical to the pattern in `scripts/init_db.py:14-15`.
**Rule**: Every script in `scripts/` that imports from the `app` package must include this `sys.path.insert` line. Use `scripts/init_db.py` as the reference template.

## Architecture Rules

### DO
- Use `tracking_id` (VARCHAR 20) as primary key for all participant-related tables
- Keep sample types as `stool` internally (display as "Fecal" in UI)
- Use `saliva_cortisol` for the new cortisol saliva sample type (suffix: COR)
- Use green color palette: #2D6A4F (primary), #52B788 (secondary), #95D5B2, #B7E4C7
- Use `tgma-card` class for cards, `stat-card` for stat cards, `btn-tgma` for buttons
- Use Satoshi font family (woff2 files in `app/static/vendor/fonts/`)
- All vendor libraries must be local files (no CDN — LAN-only server has no internet)
- DataTables for server-side paginated tables (participants list)
- Chart.js for dashboard visualizations
- Design ETL scripts as importable modules with a public function + thin CLI wrapper
- In upsert logic, only overwrite with non-NULL values (preserve existing data)
- Skip creating related records if ALL fields are NULL (optional empty sections)
- Gate admin features (sync, ID allocation, document uploads/deletes) with `@role_required('pi', 'co_pi', 'bioinformatician')`
- Always call `validate_tracking_id()` from `app/utils/helpers.py` before joining a `tracking_id` into a filesystem path — defense against path traversal via URL segments
- Test with `conda run -n base python -m pytest tests/ -v` on Windows dev machine
- Commit with `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>`

### DO NOT
- Do NOT add CDN links — all assets must be local (LAN-only, no internet on server)
- Do NOT use surrogate keys for participant tables — `tracking_id` is the PK
- Do NOT store passwords in plain text anywhere (not even in comments)
- Do NOT use `git push --force` on main
- Do NOT modify `.env` on the server without checking current values first
- Do NOT run `docker compose down -v` unless explicitly asked (destroys all data)
- Do NOT add WeasyPrint or heavy system dependencies to Dockerfile unless specifically needed
- Do NOT assume Python 3.x is default on Windows — use `conda run -n base python`
- Do NOT use multiline strings in `conda run -n base python -c` on Windows
- Do NOT overwrite existing DB values with NULL during upsert/sync operations
- Do NOT auto-sync KoboToolbox on a schedule — manual "Sync Now" button only (PI controls when)
- Do NOT accept KoboToolbox submissions missing critical fields (tracking_id, full_name, gender, district) — reject and log the reason
- Do NOT write test assertions against a specific error message when multiple validation layers exist — assert `error is not None` unless you're sure which layer fires first
- Do NOT push `app.app_context()` unconditionally in functions called from both routes and CLI — always check `flask.has_app_context()` first
- Do NOT let route handler exceptions bubble up as raw 500s — always wrap in try/except and flash a user-friendly message

## KoboToolbox Sync Strategy
- **Trigger**: Manual only — PI/Co-PI/Bioinformatician clicks "Sync Now" in UI (`/kobo`)
- **Modes**: Incremental (since last sync) or Full (re-fetch everything)
- **Critical fields (REJECT if missing)**: `tracking_id`, `full_name`, `gender`, `district`
- **Optional fields (accept as NULL)**: age, DOB, GPS, anthropometrics, lifestyle, environment, menstrual
- **Idempotent**: Upserts by `tracking_id` — syncing same submission twice updates existing record
- **NULL-safe**: Only overwrites with non-NULL values; empty optional sections don't create empty related records
- **GPS out-of-bounds**: WARNING logged but submission accepted (not rejected)
- **Gender/District fallback**: If missing from form fields, derived from tracking_id pattern (TGMA-WT-F-0001 → district=WT, gender=F)
- **Sync log**: Every run stored in `kobo_sync_log` table with counts + per-submission JSON details
- **API**: KoboToolbox REST API v2, paginated (100/page), sorted by `_submission_time`
- **State file**: `etl/.kobo_sync_state.json` stores last sync timestamp for incremental mode
- **KoboToolbox behavior**: Only fully submitted forms reach the server. Drafts stay on the phone. Field workers may skip optional sections.
