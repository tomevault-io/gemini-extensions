# Writing Guidelines for Humans and LLMs

## Core Style Principles

| Principle | Definition | Example: Good | Example: Bad |
|-----------|------------|--------------|-------------|
| Clear Language | Use simple, direct language with short words and sentences. Avoid unnecessary jargon. | "Click save to store your changes." | "Initiate the persistence process by activating the storage mechanism." |
| Developer-Focused | Write in a professional but approachable tone that addresses the reader directly. | "You can configure this option in the settings panel." | "Users might want to adjust configuration parameters." |
| Example-Driven | Include practical code examples for all key concepts. | "Use the `useState` hook: `const [count, setCount] = useState(0)`" | "State management is an important React concept." |
| Active Voice | Make the subject perform the action rather than receive it. | "React renders the component." | "The component is rendered by React." |
| Success-First | Show working examples before explaining theory. | "First, create a component: `function Button() {...}`. Now let's understand how it works..." | "The component lifecycle has several phases which you must understand before implementation..." |
| Transparent | Be honest about limitations and challenges. | "This approach works well for small datasets but may cause performance issues with larger ones." | "This is the optimal solution for data management." |
| Consistent Terms | Use the same terminology throughout to refer to the same concepts. | "Route" consistently or "endpoint" consistently, not both interchangeably. | Mixing "callback function" and "handler" for the same concept. |

## For LLM Content Generation

### Formatting Instructions

When generating content with an LLM, ensure the following:

1. **Structured Data**: Present information in well-defined structures like tables, numbered lists, and hierarchical headings
2. **Explicit Examples**: Always include contrastive examples (good vs. bad)
3. **Clear Boundaries**: Use explicit section markers and consistent formatting patterns
4. **Context-Awareness**: Begin with the most critical information for the document type
5. **Pattern Consistency**: Maintain consistent patterns throughout similar sections

### LLM Content Templates

For each document type, LLMs should structure content as follows:

```yaml
DocumentType: [Tutorial|HowTo|Reference|Explanation]
Audience: [Beginner|Intermediate|Advanced]
PrimaryGoal: "Single sentence describing document purpose"
Sections:
  - Name: "Introduction"
    Content: "Clear goal statement with outcomes"
  - Name: "Prerequisites"
    Content: "Bulleted list of requirements"
  - Name: "MainContent"
    Content: "Follows appropriate structure for document type"
  - Name: "Conclusion"
    Content: "Summary and next steps"
```

## Document Types and Their Styles

### Tutorials

**Purpose**: Guide beginners through their first complete experience
**Structure**:
- Start with a clear goal statement and outcomes
- Use numbered steps in chronological order
- Present minimal viable examples without alternatives
- Confirm success at each step

**Writing Rules**:
- Use first person plural ("Let's build") or second person ("You'll start by")
- Include complete, copy-pasteable code blocks
- Avoid introducing errors or debugging scenarios
- Use encouraging language with confirmation statements

**Example Format**:
```
## Getting Started with React

In this tutorial, you'll build your first React component. By the end, you'll have a working button component and understand basic React concepts.

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v18+
- Basic JavaScript knowledge

### Step 1: Create a new React project
Run the following command:

```bash
npx create-react-app my-first-app
cd my-first-app
```

You should see a new folder created with your React application.
```

### How-To Guides

**Purpose**: Provide task-oriented instructions for specific problems
**Structure**:
- Title using format "How to [accomplish specific task]"
- Numbered steps with clear outcomes
- Links to reference materials rather than full explanations

**Writing Rules**:
- Address the reader directly as "you"
- Assume basic familiarity with the technology
- Keep explanations focused only on completing the task
- Include prerequisites explicitly

**Example Format**:
```
## How to Add Authentication to a React Application

This guide shows you how to implement user authentication in an existing React application.

### Prerequisites
- A React application
- Basic understanding of React hooks

### Steps

1. Install the authentication library
   ```package-install
  @auth/react
   ```

2. Create an authentication context
   ```jsx
   function AuthProvider({ children }) {
     // Implementation details
     return <AuthContext.Provider value={auth}>{children}</AuthContext.Provider>;
   }
   ```
```

### Reference Documentation

**Purpose**: Provide comprehensive technical details about APIs, props, methods
**Structure**:
- Structured, consistent formatting for each item
- Complete coverage of parameters, return values, and types
- Tables, lists, and hierarchical organization

**Writing Rules**:
- Use neutral, precise language 
- Prioritize completeness over storytelling
- Include all edge cases and limitations
- Make content scannable with consistent formatting

**Example Format**:
```
## useState Hook

**Signature**: `const [state, setState] = useState(initialState)`

**Description**: Creates a state variable with a function to update it.

**Parameters**:
- `initialState`: Any value or function that returns the initial state value.

**Returns**:
- Array containing:
  1. Current state value
  2. Function to update the state

**Example**:
```jsx
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return (
    <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
      Clicked {count} times
    </button>
  );
}
```
```

### Explanation Documentation

**Purpose**: Provide conceptual understanding and background
**Structure**:
- Clear headings and subheadings
- Visual aids (diagrams, comparisons, examples)
- Links to related practical guides

**Writing Rules**:
- Use first-person plural ("we") or third-person neutral
- Include comparisons and trade-offs
- Connect to real-world scenarios
- Present multiple perspectives with recommendations

**Example Format**:
```
## Understanding React's Virtual DOM

The Virtual DOM is a core concept in React that optimizes rendering performance. This explanation covers how it works and why it matters.

### What is the Virtual DOM?

The Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM that React maintains in memory. When state changes occur:

1. React creates a new Virtual DOM tree
2. React compares it with the previous Virtual DOM tree (diffing)
3. React updates only the necessary parts of the real DOM

### Why use a Virtual DOM?

Direct DOM manipulation is expensive because:
- It triggers reflow and repaint
- Browser operations are slower than JavaScript operations

The Virtual DOM solves this by:
- Batching DOM updates
- Minimizing actual DOM operations
- Providing a declarative API
```

## MDX Documentation Formatting Rules

### Document Structure

1. **Frontmatter requirements**:
   ```mdx
   ---
   title: "Component Name"
   description: "A brief single-paragraph description of the component or feature."
   ---
   ```

2. **Heading hierarchy**:
   - Never use H1 (`#`) - the title from frontmatter serves as H1
   - Start document structure with H2 (`##`)
   - Maintain proper nesting of headings (H2 → H3 → H4)

3. **Code formatting**:
   - Inline code: Use backticks for properties, functions, variables: `useState`
   - Code blocks: Use triple backticks with language identifier
     ```jsx
     function Example() {
       return <div>Example component</div>;
     }
     ```

4. **Terminology consistency**:
   - Define terms on first use: "Content Delivery Network (CDN)"
   - Use the same term throughout the document

### Machine-Readable Patterns for LLMs

When writing documentation that will be processed by LLMs, follow these additional patterns:

1. **Explicit section markers**: Use clear heading patterns and consistent depth
2. **Pattern-based formatting**: Keep similar content in predictable structures
3. **Numbered instructions**: Use explicit numbers for sequential steps
4. **Key-value patterns**: Format properties, parameters and configurations as distinct key-value pairs
5. **Contrastive examples**: Always provide both correct and incorrect examples
6. **Semantic indicators**: Use formatting (bold, italics, code blocks) consistently for semantic meaning
