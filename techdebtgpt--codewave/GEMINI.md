## Overview

CodeWave employs 5 specialized AI agents, each with distinct expertise and responsibilities. These agents engage in three rounds of structured conversation:

1. **Round 1: Initial Assessment** - Independent evaluation
2. **Round 2: Concerns & Cross-Examination** - Challenge and discuss
3. **Round 3: Validation & Agreement** - Reach consensus

Each agent focuses on specific evaluation pillars and brings unique perspectives to the code review process.

```

### Consensus Calculation

After Round 3, final metrics are calculated using weighted averaging:

```typescript
finalMetric = (
  (agent1Score × agent1Weight) +
  (agent2Score × agent2Weight) +
  // ... all agents
) / totalWeight

confidenceLevel = highestScore - lowestScore
  // < 2.0 = high confidence
  // 2.0-3.5 = medium confidence
  // > 3.5 = low confidence (more discussion needed)
```

---

## Weights and Scoring

### Agent Weights

Each agent contributes to the consensus based on their expertise:

```typescript
const agentWeights = {
  BusinessAnalyst: {
    functionalImpact: 1.0,
    idealTimeHours: 1.0,
    qualityScore: 0.3,
    technicalDebt: 0.2,
  },
  DeveloperAuthor: {
    actualTimeHours: 1.0,
    idealTimeHours: 0.5, // input on estimates
    qualityScore: 0.4,
    technicalDebt: 0.3,
  },
  DeveloperReviewer: {
    codeQuality: 1.0,
    qualityScore: 0.8,
    technicalDebt: 0.4,
  },
  SeniorArchitect: {
    codeComplexity: 1.0,
    technicalDebt: 1.0,
    qualityScore: 0.7,
    codeQuality: 0.3,
  },
  QAEngineer: {
    testCoverage: 1.0,
    codeQuality: 0.5,
    qualityScore: 0.6,
  },
};
```

### Quality Score Components

The final Quality Score (1-10) is calculated from:

```
qualityScore = (
  (codeQuality × 0.25) +
  (codeComplexity × 0.20) +
  (testCoverage × 0.20) +
  (functionalImpact × 0.15) +
  (1.0 if technicalDebt ≤ 0 else 0.7) × 0.20
) / 1.0
```

### Overall Score

The overall evaluation score combines all metrics:

```
overallScore = (
  (codeQuality × 0.25) +
  (codeComplexity × 0.20) +
  (testCoverage × 0.20) +
  (functionalImpact × 0.15) +
  (timelineRatio × 0.10) +
  (technicalDebtFacto r × 0.10)
) / 1.0

where:
  timelineRatio = min(1.0, idealTime / actualTime)
  technicalDebtFactor = max(0, 10 - (debtHours / 5))
```

## Integration Patterns

### How Agents Are Called

```typescript
// Round 1: Initialize all agents independently
const round1Responses = await Promise.all([
  businessAnalyst.assess(commit),
  developerAuthor.assess(commit),
  developerReviewer.assess(commit),
  seniorArchitect.assess(commit),
  qaEngineer.assess(commit),
]);

// Round 2: Provide context of other responses
const round2Responses = await Promise.all([
  businessAnalyst.raiseConcerns(commit, round1Responses),
  developerAuthor.raiseConcerns(commit, round1Responses),
  developerReviewer.raiseConcerns(commit, round1Responses),
  seniorArchitect.raiseConcerns(commit, round1Responses),
  qaEngineer.raiseConcerns(commit, round1Responses),
]);

// Round 3: Final positions
const round3Responses = await Promise.all([
  businessAnalyst.validate(commit, [round1, round2]),
  developerAuthor.validate(commit, [round1, round2]),
  developerReviewer.validate(commit, [round1, round2]),
  seniorArchitect.validate(commit, [round1, round2]),
  qaEngineer.validate(commit, [round1, round2]),
]);

// Calculate consensus
const consensus = calculateConsensus(round3Responses);
```

## Common Agent Disagreements

### Quality vs. Complexity

- **Developer Reviewer** emphasizes code quality (readability, correctness)
- **Senior Architect** prioritizes simplicity and long-term maintainability
- **Resolution**: Balance immediate quality with architectural concerns

### Time Estimates

- **Business Analyst** provides ideal scenario estimate
- **Developer Author** reports actual spent time
- **Resolution**: Variance reveals process inefficiencies or unclear requirements

### Coverage vs. Quality

- **QA Engineer** focuses on test comprehensiveness
- **Developer Reviewer** emphasizes test quality over quantity
- **Resolution**: Both are important; comprehensive but poor tests are insufficient

### Business Value vs. Technical Debt

- **Business Analyst** prioritizes feature delivery and user impact
- **Senior Architect** warns about technical debt and long-term cost
- **Resolution**: Quantify technical debt to inform business decisions
