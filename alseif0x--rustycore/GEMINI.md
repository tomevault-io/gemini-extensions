# CLAUDE.md

This file is the operating guide for Claude Code in this repository. Keep it factual and current. If it conflicts with the current worktree or with C++ source, the current worktree plus C++ source wins.

## Project And Source Of Truth

RustyCore is a Rust port of a TrinityCore-derived World of Warcraft Wrath/Cata-classic private server. The port target is full functional parity with the legacy C++ server, not a smaller compatible subset.

- Rust repo: `/home/server/rustycore`
- Legacy C++ reference: `/home/server/woltk-trinity-legacy`
- Remote: `https://github.com/alseif0x/rustycore.git`
- Main work branch: `develop`
- `main` is kept fast-forward synced at stable checkpoints.
- Rust toolchain: Rust 1.85, edition 2024.
- `protoc`: `/home/cdmonio/.local/protoc/bin/protoc`

Do not trust existing Rust, old AI summaries, or migration docs as correctness proof. Always contrast behavior against the C++ source before implementing or approving a change.

### Reference Priority

The legacy C# server and older C#-based notes are secondary historical references only. They are useful for finding intent, old diagnostics, or previous packet experiments, but they are not an authority for this port.

For protocol, gameplay, database, map/runtime, and persistence behavior, the final implementation must be anchored to the C++ source under `/home/server/woltk-trinity-legacy` or to a real client/server packet capture when C++ is incomplete or ambiguous. Do not approve a layout, field order, bit count, opcode response, or runtime rule merely because a Rust comment says "C# format", "C# ref", or "matches C#".

When touching code that still cites C#:

1. Treat the C# citation as suspect until checked.
2. Locate the equivalent C++ packet/class/function.
3. Update the comment to cite C++ once verified.
4. If C++ and C# disagree, stop and document the discrepancy before changing Rust.
5. If keeping C# behavior intentionally, explain why C++ does not answer the case and add the packet capture/client-build evidence.

## Current Checkpoint

As of the last audited port state before this documentation refresh:

- Last audited port base: `1af9223 Add honest progress audit (R8-entities)`
- At that base, `develop`, `origin/develop`, `main`, and `origin/main` all pointed at `1af9223`.
- Tree expected clean on `develop`.
- Latest documented coverage count: `736/759 = 96.97%`.
- Latest handoff item: `TEST-DEBT / #NEXT.R8.ENTITIES.765`.

Start every session with:

```bash
cd /home/server/rustycore
git status --short --branch
git log --oneline --decorate -8
head -n 20 docs/migration/current-session-handoff.md
```

If HEAD has moved beyond `1af9223`, audit the commits instead of trusting their messages. A documentation-only commit that updates this file is not a new port base; code-bearing commits must still be reviewed against C++:

```bash
git log --oneline 1af9223..HEAD
git diff --stat 1af9223..HEAD
git diff 1af9223..HEAD
```

Only promote a newer commit to the reliable base after reviewing it against C++ and validating tests/docs.

## Mandatory Porting Method

Every implementation slice must follow this sequence:

1. Inspect current repo state and latest handoff.
2. Pick a real documented gap from `docs/migration/current-session-handoff.md` or the inventory files.
3. Locate exact C++ source anchors in `/home/server/woltk-trinity-legacy`.
4. Compare existing Rust against C++ before editing.
5. Implement the smallest faithful Rust change that moves the full port forward.
6. Add focused tests, preferably positive and negative branches.
7. Update migration docs/checklists with the new `#NEXT.R8.ENTITIES.xxx` item when closing a represented implementation gap.
8. Recalculate progress honestly.
9. Run validation.
10. Commit on `develop`, push, fast-forward `main`, push, and return to `develop` only at stable closure points.

Do not do "bulk close" inventory edits. A closed `#NEXT` item must correspond to real code and tests, with exact C++ refs, Rust targets, checks run, and remaining boundaries stated. Discovering or documenting a gap is useful, but it is not an implementation closeout.

Do not mark anything `manual-test-ready` unless it has actually been installed/restarted and exercised manually against the client/runtime.

## Build And Test

Use `PROTOC` explicitly for any command that may compile protobuf-dependent crates:

```bash
PROTOC=/home/cdmonio/.local/protoc/bin/protoc cargo check -p world-server
PROTOC=/home/cdmonio/.local/protoc/bin/protoc cargo test -p wow-world --lib
PROTOC=/home/cdmonio/.local/protoc/bin/protoc cargo test -p wow-map --lib
```

Fast iteration commands:

```bash
cargo fmt --check
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo test -p wow-world some_test_name --lib
cargo test -p wow-map some_test_name --lib
cargo clippy -p wow-map -p wow-world --all-targets
git diff --check
```

TSV inventory files must keep 9 tab-separated columns:

```bash
awk -F '\t' 'NF != 9 { print FNR ":" NF ":" $0; bad=1 } END { if (bad) exit 1; print "TSV_OK" }' docs/migration/inventory/r8-entities-miniphase.tsv
```

Current useful baselines from recent handoff:

- `wow-world --lib`: clean in recent runs.
- `wow-map --lib`: cleaned to `614/0` in `#NEXT.R8.ENTITIES.765`.
- `world-server` check passes with existing warnings.

If a test fails, do not assume production is wrong or the test is wrong. Contrast with C++ and document which one it is.

## Architecture: Current Runtime Reality

The runtime currently has three coexisting world models. This is important; old notes that describe a single pending `MapManager` integration are stale.

1. Legacy `wow_world::MapManager`
   - Shared as `Arc<RwLock<...>>` from `crates/world-server/src/main.rs`.
   - Shared across sessions.
   - Runs represented creature AI/combat through session-driven ticks such as `tick_creatures_sync` and `tick_combat_sync`.
   - Has no independent global clock; it advances when logged-in sessions tick it.

2. Canonical `wow_map::MapManager`
   - Owns the global canonical map tick loop (`spawn_canonical_map_update_loop`, about 10ms).
   - Has a C++-like `Map::Update` structure and map/spawn/respawn infrastructure.
   - Creature runtime update currently uses default context and does not dispatch real AI/combat side effects such as `AiUpdateTick` or `MeleeAttackIfReady`.

3. Global world loop
   - Ticks the canonical `wow_map::MapManager`.
   - Does not tick the legacy `wow_world::MapManager`.

Regression anchors from `#NEXT.R8.ENTITIES.764`:

- `canonical_map_update_visits_creature_with_no_real_ai_combat_effect_like_cpp`
- `two_sessions_sharing_legacy_map_manager_see_same_creature_state`

The old statement that `WorldSession` owns a `creatures: HashMap<ObjectGuid, CreatureAI>` field is false. Do not build new work around that field.

Incremental live-runtime roadmap from handoff:

1. Characterize current split. Done in `#NEXT.R8.ENTITIES.764`.
2. Give the legacy map a sessionless clock.
3. Add creature movement fanout from global tick via per-map session registry.
4. Move combat resolution to global clock, resolving once rather than per session.
5. Unify respawn from per-session queue into canonical runtime.
6. Move to a single source of truth for creatures, method by method.
7. Add real `SendObjectUpdates`, scripts, weather, threat, and remaining fanout.

Steps 2+ are architectural-risk work. Avoid big-bang rewrites. Previous `_attic/` attempts failed with large compile-error blasts; use them only as historical context.

## Important Current Open Gaps

The exact list changes as the port advances. Always read the handoff first. Current repeatedly documented gaps include:

- Full `ConditionMgr` target/searcher/map/world-state/active-event coverage.
- `Player::SatisfyQuestBreadcrumbQuest` recursive `CanTakeQuest` gate.
- `SatisfyQuestTimed`, day, week, month gates at accept.
- GM override visibility and server-side visibility infrastructure.
- AI override dialog status.
- Battleground chest `CanActivateGO`.
- Live-runtime / map-manager tick integration.
- Runtime install/restart/manual client-test readiness for many represented slices.

Do not use this list as exhaustive; use the migration inventory as the source for current planning.

## Migration Documents

Primary current-state docs:

- `docs/migration/current-session-handoff.md`
- `docs/migration/inventory/r8-entities-miniphase.md`
- `docs/migration/inventory/r8-entities-miniphase.tsv`
- `docs/migration/honest-progress-audit.md` (honest progress audit; or similarly named audit docs if present).
- `docs/MIGRATION_ROADMAP.md` (phase-ordered execution plan) and `docs/migration/_INDEX.md` (per-module status/audit). Use them for plan/order; their status snapshots predate the R8-entities work and have drifted, so they are not proof of current state.

Older snapshots such as `MIGRATION_STATUS.md` may be stale. They can help find concepts but are not proof of current parity.

When updating docs:

- Put newest items at the top where the file already follows reverse chronological order.
- Include C++ refs, Rust targets, acceptance, checks, and boundaries.
- Keep `represented-partial` unless full runtime parity is actually proven.
- Do not inflate progress with planning-only or test-debt-only work.

## Packet Handler Dispatch

The world server uses static registration via the `inventory` crate. A handler runs only if it both:

- has a dispatcher match arm, and
- registers a `PacketHandlerEntry` via `inventory::submit!`.

Forgetting `submit!` can silently drop the opcode even if the match arm exists. Each `PacketHandlerEntry` declares opcode, `SessionStatus`, and `PacketProcessing` mode. See `crates/wow-handler/src/lib.rs`.

Handler modules live under `crates/wow-world/src/handlers/`.

## Coding Patterns

- Prefer existing local helpers and `*_like_cpp` functions over inventing new abstractions.
- Use C++ names/order when mirroring C++ behavior.
- Collect packets into `Vec<Vec<u8>>` before sending when it avoids borrow conflicts.
- In tick methods, use `send_tx.send(pkt.to_bytes())` rather than `send_packet` if `send_packet` would double-borrow.
- `Position` fields are `.x`, `.y`, `.z`, `.orientation`; not `.o`.
- Import `wow_packet::ClientPacket` explicitly in handler modules that decode packets.
- Use `rg` for searching.
- Use `apply_patch` for manual edits.
- Do not revert unrelated user/agent changes without explicit instruction.

## Runtime / Config

Two primary binaries:

- `bnet-server`: Battle.net auth, TCP+TLS on `1119`, REST on `8081`. Reads `BNetServer.conf` and PEM files.
- `world-server`: game server, TCP on `8085` / `8086`. Reads `WorldServer.conf`.

MariaDB databases: `auth`, `characters`, `world`, `hotfixes`.

Gitignored runtime files may contain credentials or keys:

- `*.pem`
- `BNetServer.conf`
- `WorldServer.conf`
- root `world-server` / `bnet-server` binaries

Never stage credentials, certs, local configs, or built binaries.

## Git Discipline

Stable closeout workflow:

```bash
git status --short --branch
cargo fmt --check
# focused tests
PROTOC=/home/cdmonio/.local/protoc/bin/protoc cargo check -p world-server
git diff --check
git add <changed files>
git commit -m "<short faithful summary>"
git push origin develop
git checkout main
git merge --ff-only develop
git push origin main
git checkout develop
git status --short --branch
```

Only do this after the slice is genuinely validated. If the tree contains changes from another agent, audit them before building on top of them.

## Local Context Files

The `.gitignore` excludes local agent/workflow files that may exist and contain useful context, such as `AGENTS.md`, `PLAN.md`, `MIGRATION_STATUS.md`, `INVENTORY.md`, `memory/`, `.claude/`, `.agents/`, `.openclaw/`, and similar directories. Read them if useful, but do not commit ignored local context unless the user explicitly asks for it.
