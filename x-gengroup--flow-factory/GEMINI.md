> Check all subclasses when modifying base class interfaces


Changes to abc.py base classes (BaseTrainer, BaseAdapter, BaseRewardModel) affect ALL subclasses.
Before modifying:
- List ALL subclasses that override the changed method
- Update each subclass to match the new signature
- Verify no trainer/adapter/reward is broken
See constraints #11-#14 in .agents/knowledge/constraints.md.
