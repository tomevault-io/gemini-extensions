# CLAUDE.md - Apple Photos MCP Server

This file provides guidance for AI agents (Claude, etc.) when using this MCP server.

## Overview

This MCP server gives AI assistants access to the macOS Apple Photos library
via [osxphotos](https://github.com/RhetTbull/osxphotos) — **read-only by
default**. All operations are **local** — nothing leaves the user's machine.
You can query the library (including by GPS radius, aesthetic score, and
OCR-detected text), inspect individual photos (singly or in batches, including
EXIF camera data, ML score/detected text, shared-album comments/likes, and
burst siblings), read the **live Photos.app selection**, **see** photos inline
via thumbnails, find exact-duplicate groups, browse the library's structure
(albums, folders, keywords, persons), and **export** copies of photos to a
directory.

**Write tools exist but are gated:** `create-album`, `add-to-album`,
`remove-from-album`, `set-photo-metadata`, `set-keywords`, `set-photo-date`,
and `import-photos` only work when the user has set
`APPLE_PHOTOS_MCP_ENABLE_WRITES=1` (env or config.json + server restart).
Until then every write call returns a clear opt-in error — **run `doctor`
first** when writes matter: its `writes` check reports the gate state. Even
with writes enabled, **nothing can delete a photo** (see "Write workflow"
below).

- **[docs/WRITE-BACKEND.md](./docs/WRITE-BACKEND.md)** — why reads use osxphotos
  (direct DB) and writes use photoscript/AppleScript, and why that split can't be
  collapsed (no safe DB writes; osxphotos's own writes *are* AppleScript; PhotoKit
  needs an app bundle). Read before proposing to "eliminate AppleScript" in writes.

## First-run requirements

Before any tool works, two things must be in place:

1. **Python sidecar installed — self-installing.** The server shells out to
   osxphotos (Python). For most users this needs **no manual step**: the venv at
   `./venv` is built automatically on the first tool call (a one-time setup that
   can take ~a minute; progress logs to stderr), then the call proceeds. The venv
   is also picked up without a restart once it exists, and rebuilt automatically
   if a package update changes its requirements. Pre-warm it with `pnpm run setup`
   to skip the first-call delay. Auto-setup needs Python 3, `pip`, and network
   access; it can be disabled with `APPLE_PHOTOS_MCP_NO_AUTO_SETUP=1` (then you
   must run `pnpm run setup` or `pip3 install osxphotos` yourself).
2. **Full Disk Access granted** to the host app (Claude/Terminal/iTerm/VS Code),
   then the host app **fully restarted**. The Photos library database is in a
   protected directory; without FDA, *every* tool fails. See
   [docs/FULL-DISK-ACCESS.md](./docs/FULL-DISK-ACCESS.md).

Run **`health-check`** first when in doubt — it confirms both at once (osxphotos
present + library openable). When something is actually broken, reach for
**`doctor`**: it's the richest diagnostic, checking the Python interpreter
(path + version — warns below the required 3.11), osxphotos install, the
sidecar execution mode (persistent vs one-shot fallback), the write-tools gate
(enabled/disabled + backend readiness), library readability, and Full Disk
Access separately and reporting each as ok / warn / fail with an actionable
message — so it pinpoints *which* of the first-run requirements is missing.

## Performance model: cold vs warm calls

The Python sidecar runs as a **persistent process**: the first tool call pays a
one-time cost (python start + osxphotos import + a full parse of the library
database — roughly ~4 s on a ~30k-photo library, more on bigger ones), and
subsequent calls reuse the resident parsed library and complete in
**milliseconds**. The sidecar re-checks the library's modification time before
every request, so results are never stale — a changed library (import, edit,
album rename) triggers an automatic re-parse on the next call. After 5 idle
minutes (`APPLE_PHOTOS_MCP_SIDECAR_IDLE_MS`) the process is killed to free
memory and the next call pays the cold cost again. Practical upshot: don't
avoid follow-up calls for cost reasons — a `query` → `get-photo` → `export`
chain costs the parse once, not three times. Batch `export`s report per-photo
MCP progress notifications when the request carries a `progressToken`.

**Don't rely on the final `done === total` progress notification.** Treat the
per-photo notifications as the progress signal and the **tool result** (its
`exportedCount` / `skippedCount`) as the completion signal. An MCP client
deletes a request's progress handler the moment the response arrives and
discards any notification for that token afterwards — so a notification emitted
immediately before the result, which the terminal one is by definition, is
intermittently thrown away. The server flushes its sends before returning to
narrow that window but cannot close it; measured on a loaded machine, the server
sent four notifications and the client delivered one. The terminal notification
is therefore **best effort**. It is still emitted (useful when it lands, and
nothing depends on it), and the integration test deliberately does not assert it.

## The core workflow: query, then act

The reliable pattern is **two steps**: use `query` to find photos and get their
**UUIDs**, then use those UUIDs with `get-photo` / `get-photos` (full details),
`get-thumbnail` (see the image), or `export` (copy files).

```
1. query   → returns photo summaries, each with a UUID
2a. get-photo uuid="..."          → full metadata for one photo
2b. get-photos uuid=["...", ...]  → full metadata for up to 50 in ONE call
2c. get-thumbnail uuid="..."      → the photo itself, as an inline image
2d. export uuid=["...","..."] dest="..."   → copy files out
```

UUIDs are the **canonical, reliable handle** for a photo. Filenames and titles
can repeat or be empty; a UUID is unique and stable. Always carry the UUID from
`query` into the follow-up tools rather than re-searching by name.

**Prefer `get-thumbnail` over `export` when the user wants to LOOK at a
photo** ("show me", "which one is better", "what does it say") — it returns a
renderable image block with nothing written to disk. Use `export` only when
the user wants actual files. **Prefer `get-photos` over N `get-photo` calls**
whenever you hold more than a couple of UUIDs.

Two worked patterns built from these pieces:

- **Recently-imported sweep:** `query { addedInLast: "7d", newestFirst: true,
  limit: 20 }` → the newest imports; refine with `noKeyword: true` for the
  untagged backlog, or `screenshot: true` for cleanup candidates. Import date
  (`dateAdded`) is not the taken date — `addedInLast` is the right filter for
  "what just came in".
- **Dedupe with visual verification:** `find-duplicates` → groups of exact
  duplicates (Photos' fingerprint; identical image data only) → `get-thumbnail`
  a member or two per group to eyeball them → since this server cannot delete,
  collect the extra copies into a quarantine album (writes enabled: the
  album-quarantine pattern below; otherwise have the user do it in Photos.app)
  and let the user delete from there.

## Write workflow (gated — check `doctor` first)

The write tools follow the same query-then-act shape: `query` /
`find-duplicates` for UUIDs, then the write tool with those explicit UUIDs.
Rules that keep writes safe and predictable:

- **Check the gate before promising anything.** A write call on a read-only
  server returns "Write tools are disabled…" with the opt-in recipe
  (`APPLE_PHOTOS_MCP_ENABLE_WRITES=1` via env or config.json + restart) —
  relay that recipe to the user rather than retrying. `doctor`'s `writes`
  check reports the state up front.
- **There is NO delete.** Deliberately: no tool deletes photos, albums, or
  folders. The deletion UX is the **album-quarantine pattern** — file the
  condemned photos into a clearly-named album and have the user review +
  delete inside Photos.app (30-day Recently Deleted safety net):
  ```
  1. find-duplicates                        → groups with UUIDs
  2. create-album name="Duplicates — review & delete"   (idempotent)
  3. add-to-album with each group's EXTRA copies (keep the best per group)
  4. tell the user to review the album in Photos.app and delete there
  ```
- **`remove-from-album` rebuilds the album.** Photos' AppleScript has no
  remove verb, so removal recreates the album minus the removed photos: the
  album **UUID changes** (response carries `previousAlbumUuid` → `album.uuid`)
  and manual sort order is lost. It never touches the photos themselves. Use
  the NEW uuid for follow-up calls (or just use the album name).
- **`set-keywords` merges, never replaces.** Union semantics: existing
  keywords the caller doesn't mention are preserved. Revert with the echoed
  `before` list. A keyword in both `add` and `remove` is rejected.
- **Metadata writes echo before/after** — capture `before` when the user may
  want an undo.
- **`set-photo-date` is a DRY RUN by default.** Always preview first, then
  apply with `dryRun: false` — the trailcam/scanner date-fix workflow:
  ```
  1. get-thumbnail on the photo (raise minSize) → read the burned-in date strip
  2. set-photo-date uuid=… date="2026-05-14T06:32:00"      ← dryRun defaults TRUE
     → echoes before/after, writes NOTHING; sanity-check the delta
  3. set-photo-date … dryRun=false                          ← the actual write
  4. keep the echoed `before` — reverting = set-photo-date date=<before> dryRun=false
  ```
  Whole batches with one wrong clock shift with `shiftSeconds` (the same
  offset per photo) instead of an absolute `date`. Photos-library date only —
  the file's EXIF is never touched (same as Photos.app's *Adjust Date & Time*).
- **`import-photos` is add-only and CANNOT be undone programmatically** (no
  AppleScript photo-delete verb) — confirm the file list with the user before
  importing. Sources must exist under the export allowlist roots; the target
  `album` must already exist (`create-album` first). The default duplicate
  check makes Photos.app pop a blocking dialog on duplicates — warn the user,
  or pass `skipDuplicateCheck: true` only when re-imports are acceptable.
- **Writes target the library currently open in Photos.app** (normally the
  system library); the `library` parameter applies to read tools only. Writes
  launch Photos.app if needed and require macOS **Automation** permission —
  the first write may pop a one-time system prompt.

## Conventions and behaviors to know

- **Dates are ISO 8601.** `fromDate` / `toDate` on `query` take ISO 8601 strings
  (e.g. `"2025-06-01"`). A bare `toDate` (no time part) includes that whole day;
  a full datetime (e.g. `"2025-06-30T18:00:00"`) is a precise exclusive upper
  bound. Dates returned by the tools are ISO 8601 too.
- **Hidden photos are excluded by default.** `query` does not return hidden
  photos unless you pass `hidden: true` (only hidden) — `notHidden` is the
  default behavior. Likewise use `favorite` / `notFavorite` to narrow on
  favorites.
- **Results are paged: `count` vs `returned`.** `query` reports `count` (the
  TOTAL number of matches) and `returned` (how many summaries are in the
  response). When `limit` is omitted, a default limit of 500 applies — check
  `count > returned` to detect truncation and raise `limit` if you need more.
- **Filters are ANY-match and combinable.** `album`, `keyword`, `person`, and
  `uuid` are arrays; within one filter the match is ANY (OR). Combining
  different filters narrows the result (AND across filter types).
- **`person` depends on named faces.** Only people you've named in Photos are
  filterable; unnamed faces show as `_UNKNOWN_`. Use `list-persons` to see
  available names first.
- **Export is the only tool that writes files outside the library — and it
  never modifies the library.** `export`
  writes file copies to the `dest` directory (created if missing). `dest` must
  resolve — after `~` expansion and symlink resolution — to a path under the
  home directory, `/tmp`, `/private/tmp`, or `/Volumes`; anything else is
  rejected with an error naming those roots. It never
  modifies the Photos library (the opt-in write tools modify the library, not a
  destination directory — see "Write workflow" above). By default it exports
  the original; use
  `edited: true`, `live: true` (live-photo video), `raw: true`, and
  `overwrite: true` as needed. Without `overwrite`, a photo whose file already
  exists at `dest` is skipped with a per-UUID reason (never duplicated), and
  unknown/trashed UUIDs are reported as skipped too — every requested UUID is
  accounted for. Note the asymmetry: `get-photo` DOES resolve photos in
  Recently Deleted (it falls back to the trash), while `query` and `export`
  read the main library only — so a UUID `get-photo` just returned can still be
  skipped by `export` as "UUID not found (deleted or in trash)". Confirm `dest`
  before running on shared machines.
- **iCloud-only originals are slow.** If an original isn't on disk, `export`
  falls back to Photos.app to download it on demand — slower for large batches,
  and skipped (with a per-UUID reason) if the download fails. See
  [docs/LIMITATIONS.md](./docs/LIMITATIONS.md). The server stays responsive
  while a long export (or query) runs: operations are serialized one-at-a-time,
  and a concurrent `health-check` returns a quick liveness summary — while
  `doctor` still reports the interpreter/osxphotos checks and marks the
  library probe as skipped — instead of hanging until the operation finishes.
- **Non-default libraries.** The read tools — `library-info`, `query`,
  `get-photo`, `get-photos`, `get-thumbnail`, `find-duplicates`, `list-albums`,
  `list-folders`, `list-keywords`, `list-persons`, `export` — accept an optional
  `library` path to target a `.photoslibrary` other than the system one. The
  write tools, `get-selected-photos`, `health-check` and `doctor` do **not**:
  writes and the selection bridge always target the library currently open in
  Photos.app.

## Tools at a glance

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `health-check` | Verify osxphotos is installed and the library opens (while another operation is running it answers immediately with a liveness summary instead of queueing behind it) |
| `doctor` | Full setup diagnostic — Python interpreter version, osxphotos install, sidecar mode (persistent vs one-shot), write-tools gate, library readability, and Full Disk Access, each ok/warn/fail with advice (richer than `health-check`) |
| `library-info` | High-level counts (photos, movies, albums, folders, keywords, persons) |
| `query` | Find photos by taken/import date, album, keyword, person, ML label, place, GPS radius (`near`), folder, year, size, media type, aesthetic score (`minScore`), OCR text (`detectedText`), or flags → returns UUIDs (`newestFirst` for the N most recent) |
| `get-photo` | Full metadata for one photo by UUID (incl. EXIF camera data, ML `score`/`detectedText`, shared-album social data; `burstPhotos: true` adds burst siblings) |
| `get-photos` | Full metadata for up to 50 UUIDs in one batched call |
| `get-selected-photos` | The photos currently selected in the Photos.app window — "act on these"; errors (never launches Photos) when Photos isn't running or nothing is selected |
| `get-thumbnail` | The photo itself as an inline viewable image (from Photos' derivatives; `minSize` px, default 360) |
| `find-duplicates` | Groups of exact duplicates via Photos' fingerprint detection |
| `list-albums` | All albums with folder paths and photo counts |
| `list-folders` | All folders with parent and album/subfolder counts |
| `list-keywords` | Keywords sorted by usage count |
| `list-persons` | Named people sorted by photo count |
| `export` | Copy photo(s) by UUID to a destination directory |
| `create-album` | *(write, gated)* Create an album, optionally in a folder path; idempotent |
| `add-to-album` | *(write, gated)* File photos into an album by UUID; idempotent, per-UUID report |
| `remove-from-album` | *(write, gated)* Remove photos from an album ONLY (never the library); rebuilds the album — UUID changes |
| `set-photo-metadata` | *(write, gated)* Set title/description/favorite; echoes before/after for undo |
| `set-keywords` | *(write, gated)* Add/remove keywords with union semantics — unmentioned keywords preserved |
| `set-photo-date` | *(write, gated)* Fix a photo's date (absolute or `shiftSeconds`); **dry run by default**, before/after echoed for revert; Photos-DB date only |
| `import-photos` | *(write, gated)* Import files into the library (optionally into an existing album); add-only, cannot be undone programmatically |

## Error Handling

| Error | Likely cause | What to do |
|-------|--------------|------------|
| "osxphotos not installed. Install it with: pip3 install osxphotos ..." | Auto-setup couldn't run — disabled via `APPLE_PHOTOS_MCP_NO_AUTO_SETUP=1`, or Python 3 / `pip` / network unavailable (normally the venv self-installs on first use) | Run the `doctor` tool to diagnose; `pip3 install osxphotos` (needs Python >= 3.11) or `scripts/setup.sh` from a checkout, or unset `APPLE_PHOTOS_MCP_NO_AUTO_SETUP` |
| "operation not permitted" / "unable to open database" / permission error | Full Disk Access not granted (or granted to the wrong app) | Grant FDA to the **host** app and fully restart it — see [docs/FULL-DISK-ACCESS.md](./docs/FULL-DISK-ACCESS.md) |
| "Photo not found: <uuid>" | Wrong/stale UUID, or photo deleted | Re-run `query` to get current UUIDs, then retry |
| Export skipped: "original not downloaded from iCloud" | iCloud-only original couldn't be fetched | Check iCloud connectivity / signed-in state; ensure Photos.app automation is allowed |
| Export skipped: "Photo does not have adjustments..." / "raw component not on disk..." | `edited` requested but the photo has no edits / `raw` requested but the raw file isn't downloaded | Retry without that flag |
| Export skipped: "already exists at destination" | A file with that name is already at `dest` and `overwrite` wasn't set | Pass `overwrite: true` to replace, or export to a fresh directory |
| Export skipped: "UUID not found (deleted or in trash)" | Stale UUID — photo deleted or moved to Recently Deleted since the query | Re-run `query` to get current UUIDs |
| "Write tools are disabled — apple-photos-mcp is read-only by default" | The `APPLE_PHOTOS_MCP_ENABLE_WRITES=1` opt-in isn't set | Relay the opt-in recipe (env or config.json + server restart); confirm with `doctor`'s `writes` check |
| "Album not found: '…'" | Wrong album name/UUID, or the album lives in a different library than the one open in Photos.app | `list-albums` for exact names; `create-album` to create it |
| Write fails with AppleScript error `-1743` / "not authorized" | macOS Automation permission for Photos not granted (or denied) to the host app | Re-enable under System Settings → Privacy & Security → Automation → (host app) → Photos; first write from a GUI session triggers the one-time prompt |
| "Operation timed out after 60000ms" | Very large library — the first (cold) call after startup, an idle period, or a library change parses the whole Photos DB | Set `APPLE_PHOTOS_MCP_TIMEOUT` (ms) higher; warm calls are then fast |
| "…timed out … This tool's timeout is fixed at *N*ms" | A tool that carries its OWN budget hit it: `get-selected-photos` 2 min, `find-duplicates` 5 min, the write tools 5 min (`remove-from-album` and `import-photos` 10 min), `export` 30 min | `APPLE_PHOTOS_MCP_TIMEOUT` does **not** apply to these — shrink the request (fewer UUIDs, smaller batch, lower `limit`) and retry |
| "Export destination ... is outside the allowed export roots" | `dest` resolves outside home, `/tmp`, `/private/tmp`, and `/Volumes` (symlinks are followed) | Pick a destination under one of those roots |
| Database-lock error | Photos.app is mid-write | Close Photos.app and retry (queries only — iCloud export needs Photos) |

## Quick reference: getting the most from a request

- "How many photos do I have?" → `library-info`
- "Find X" → `query` (then summarize the UUIDs/filenames returned)
- "What did I import this week?" → `query` with `addedInLast: "7d"`, `newestFirst: true`
- "Find my screenshots / selfies / panoramas" → `query` with the media-type flag
- "Tell me about that photo" → `get-photo` with the UUID from the query
- "Compare these / audit EXIF across these" → `get-photos` with the UUIDs (one call)
- "Show me that photo" / "which is better?" → `get-thumbnail` (raise `minSize` to read small text)
- "Do I have duplicates?" → `find-duplicates`, then `get-thumbnail` to verify visually
- "Export those" → `export` with the UUIDs and a `dest`
- "What albums / keywords / people are there?" → `list-albums` / `list-keywords` / `list-persons`
- "File these into an album" → *(writes gated)* `create-album` then `add-to-album` with the UUIDs
- "Tag / caption / favorite these" → *(writes gated)* `set-keywords` (union merge) / `set-photo-metadata`
- "These photos" (selected in Photos.app) → `get-selected-photos` → feed the UUIDs onward
- "The dates on these are wrong" → *(writes gated)* `set-photo-date` — dry run first, then `dryRun: false`
- "Photos near the cabin / at these coordinates" → `query` with `near: "lat,lon,radiusKm"`
- "The good ones / best shots" → `query` with `minScore` (+ `newestFirst`)
- "Photos with text / of receipts" → `query` with `detectedText` (combine with `screenshot` or dates)
- "Import these files / scans" → *(writes gated)* `import-photos` (confirm the list first — imports can't be undone programmatically)
- "Delete the duplicates" → cannot delete: album-quarantine pattern (`create-album` + `add-to-album`), user deletes in Photos.app

## Recurring macOS permission prompts → offer the official-Node fix

If a user reports being **repeatedly** prompted for Full Disk Access or
Automation for "node" (especially after a `brew upgrade`), or that this MCP
loses its permissions every so often, the cause is almost always an **ad-hoc
signed Node** (typically Homebrew's) whose cdhash changes on every update, so
macOS TCC keeps treating it as a brand-new binary.

Detect it:

```bash
codesign -dvvv "$(which node)" 2>&1 | grep -E 'Signature=adhoc|TeamIdentifier=not set'
```

If that matches (ad-hoc / no Team ID), **offer to migrate this MCP to the
official Developer-ID-signed Node** per
[`docs/NODE-RUNTIME-AND-TCC-PERMISSIONS.md`](docs/NODE-RUNTIME-AND-TCC-PERMISSIONS.md):
install an official LTS Node to a stable path (e.g. `~/mcp-runtime/node-current`),
repoint this server's `command` at it, and have the user grant the permission
once — it then persists across Node updates. Do not repoint `npx`-launched
servers that don't need Full Disk Access.
