# Xeo Forge V3 — Agent & Architecture Rules

> Product contract: **The Control Plane for Agentic Work**. Chat is conversation; Work is governed agency.

This file is the contract for working in this repo. Keep it short, keep it enforced.
If a change violates a rule here, the change is wrong — not the rule.

## 1. What this product is

One governed AI agent with reusable execution context:
1. **Chat surface** — conversational answers and exploration; it never creates a plan or executes write tools.
2. **Work surface** — intent-aware agent work. Normal messages stay conversational; explicit planning starts Planning, and direct execution requests pause for an auditable user choice.
3. **Planning mode** — read-only inspection, produces a structured plan for approval.
4. **Build mode** — executes an immutable approved plan or an immutable, explicitly accepted execution brief.
5. **Context layers** — Prompt Studio instructions, approved memories, Agent Profiles, and Agent Skills are compiled into the run context.

The agent:
1. receives a conversation or Work request from a user and classifies intent before selecting planning or execution,
2. loads policy, profile, skill, task context, and approved memories,
3. inspects and analyzes (planning) or executes (build),
4. returns a final result and bounded memory candidates,
5. persists full history and audit events,
6. consumes credits per run.

Plus auth, per-user credits, admin controls, ONE global model configuration,
reusable profiles and skills, context management, and an inspectable audit trail.

New capabilities must preserve the approval gate, task-scoped authorization, single source of truth, and end-to-end UI-to-persistence behavior.

## 2. Hard architecture rules (non-negotiable)

1. **Single source of truth.** One canonical schema per entity. One writer per
   resource. No dual persistence. No second copy of the same logical data that
   can drift.
2. **One delivery path for events.** Task events are persisted with a monotonic
   per-task `seq`. SSE replays from the DB only, tracks `maxSeq`, then forwards
   live events with `seq > maxSeq`. No in-memory replay buffer racing the DB.
   (This is the V1 duplication bug. Do not reintroduce it.)
3. **No silent failures.** No `catch {}` without logging. Every caught error is
   logged with context. Persistence failures must be visible, never swallowed.
4. **End-to-end or not at all.** No UI control that points at a route that does
   not exist. No route that only half-works. Build the full path:
   input → agent → tools → persistence → UI.
5. **One global model.** All users share one model config. No per-user model
   selection. Source of truth: `model_settings` row id=1, seeded from env.
   API keys are NEVER returned to any client — always masked.
6. **Credits are atomic.** Debit via conditional `UPDATE ... WHERE balance >= ?`.
   Every balance change writes a `credit_ledger` row with `balance_after`.
   No read-then-write race.
7. **Authz on every task-scoped route.** Owner-or-admin check, always.
8. **No ungoverned feature creep.** Do not add subagents, teams, connectors,
   schedules, marketplaces, plugins, analytics, or permission frameworks without
   a written V3 design, explicit authorization boundaries, and an end-to-end path.
9. **No dead code.** Don't scaffold for "future features". Delete what isn't used.
10. **Typecheck stays clean.** `tsc --noEmit` has zero errors. Never hide errors
    behind `ignoreBuildErrors`.

## 3. Tech stack

- Next.js 14 App Router, React 18, TypeScript 5 (strict).
- Tailwind CSS for styling.
- DB: SQLite (better-sqlite3) in dev, PostgreSQL (pg) in prod, via one adapter
  exposing `prepare().{get,all,run}` returning Promises.
- LLM: `openai` SDK against an OpenAI-compatible endpoint (streaming tool calls).
- Auth: cookie session (`xeo_session`), token = random 32 bytes, stored as sha256.
- Local runtime: an optional Go process broker (`native/runtime-broker`), bound to
  loopback and gated by a per-install shared secret.

## 4. Data model (the only tables)

- `users` — id, email, password_hash, display_name, is_admin, is_root_admin,
  is_suspended, created_at.
- `auth_sessions` — token_hash (pk), user_id, expires_at.
- `credits` — user_id (pk), balance, daily_grant, last_reset_at, updated_at.
- `credit_ledger` — id, user_id, delta, reason, ref_id, balance_after, created_at.
- `tasks` — id, user_id, goal, status (including awaiting_decision), mode
  (chat|planning|build), project_path, intent_kind, decision_state,
  decision_expires_at, plan (latest proposed plan), approved_plan (immutable
  snapshot frozen at approval — also holds the frozen execution brief for an
  accepted direct-execution decision), plan_version, profile_id, skill_id,
  result_summary, credits_spent, error, created_at, updated_at.
- `task_events` — id, task_id, seq, type, content (JSON), created_at.
  UNIQUE(task_id, seq).
- `messages` — id, task_id, role (user|assistant|system), content, active,
  created_at. Conversation history per task. `active` distinguishes live-context
  rows (1) from archived rows (0) that compaction has summarized away.
- `model_settings` — id (always 1), name, base_url, api_key, model_id,
  temperature, max_tokens, context_window, auto_compact_threshold, updated_at.
  `context_window` = total tokens the model can hold. `auto_compact_threshold` =
  context usage % that triggers automatic compaction (1–100, default 80).
- `admin_actions` — id, admin_id, target_user_id, action, detail, created_at.
- `uploads` — id, task_id, user_id, filename, kind, status, byte_size, rel_path,
  file_count, extracted_bytes, error, created_at, updated_at. Quarantined until
  scanned; archives are expanded into the task workspace.
- `agent_profiles` — id, user_id, name, kind, description, instructions, enabled,
  version, created_at, updated_at. Reusable agent roles.
- `agent_skills` — id, user_id, name, kind, description, instructions,
  profile_id, enabled, version, created_at, updated_at. Reusable workflows,
  optionally bound to one profile.
- `agent_instructions` — id, user_id, task_id, scope, name, content, priority,
  enabled, version, created_at, updated_at. Prompt Studio layers.
- `agent_memories` — id, user_id, task_id, scope, kind, content, status,
  confidence, source_task_id, source_message_id, pinned, expires_at, created_at,
  updated_at. Candidates are `proposed` until the user approves them; only
  approved memories are compiled into run context.

Do not add tables without a real, present use. V3 tables must have an end-to-end API, agent, persistence, and UI path.

**Design note: intent metadata.** Intent classification is deterministic and
re-derivable from the goal (`lib/agent/intent.ts`), so only the resulting
`intent_kind` is persisted. Confidence and reason are emitted as `intent` events
in the audit trail rather than duplicated as task columns (rule 1).

**Design note: execution briefs.** A direct-execution decision freezes its brief
into `approved_plan`, reusing the one immutable-contract column the build loop
already reads. A second column would be a parallel path to the same behavior.

**Design note: execution_cursor.** There is no persisted step list or cursor.
The agent loop is model-driven — the LLM decides what to do each iteration.
Adding a cursor would be dead state that never drives execution.

## 5. Execution flow (must work end-to-end)

1. User submits a Chat or Work request with a surface and goal.
2. Server classifies intent deterministically before starting any governed run.
3. Conversation intent starts Chat; explicit planning starts Planning; direct execution creates `awaiting_decision` and starts nothing.
4. Server checks credits where the selected run requires them, debits creation cost atomically (402 if insufficient).
5. Server creates `tasks` row with the canonical intent and decision state.
6. A decision endpoint accepts `direct` or `plan` once, only before its server-enforced deadline. Direct acceptance freezes an execution brief; plan acceptance starts Planning.
7. Runner starts fire-and-forget; `.catch` marks task failed AND emits a failure
   event (never silent).
8. Agent builds context, streams model output, and dispatches tools.
   - **Chat mode:** conversational/read-only tools only; it cannot write or execute.
   - **Planning mode:** file and browser inspection only; write tools are
     HARD-LOCKED at dispatch. Planning concludes with task_complete and status=planned.
   - **Build mode:** full tool access. Executes approved_plan or accepted
     execution_brief as an immutable contract — no plan rewriting.
   - **Browser:** local extension inspection is read-only by default. Navigation,
     clicks, typing, and submission require an explicit interaction policy.
9. Every step is emitted as a `task_events` row (seq-ordered) and over SSE.
10. Per-tool-call credits are debited as incurred; total is recorded on the task.
11. Planning task ends: status=planned, proposed plan stored. Build task ends:
    status=completed|failed, result_summary stored.
12. User watches live via SSE and sees history on reload (same data, one source).
13. User approves/rejects the plan: approve atomically snapshots the plan into
    approved_plan, flips mode to build, and starts the build run. Reject resets to
    planning mode and auto-starts a new planning run for revision. A direct Work
    decision freezes execution_brief and enters build only after explicit choice.
14. User can send follow-up messages on completed/failed tasks — conversation
    history is persisted in messages and injected into the agent's LLM context.
15. User can switch modes at any time (non-running tasks) via `POST /tasks/:id/mode`.
    Switching to planning clears approved_plan and auto-starts a new planning run.
16. Admin can inspect any user, any task, any ledger entry; adjust credits;
    enable/disable users; view/update the global model.



## 5.5 Behavioral guards (runtime safety)

The agent loop includes runtime guards against common failure modes observed in
production. These are NOT prompt-level suggestions — they are code-enforced
checks. The detectors, thresholds and nudge copy live in `lib/agent/guards.ts`
(one implementation, imported by both dispatch paths in `lib/agent/loop.ts` and
by the unit tests); the double-fail check lives in `lib/agent/runner.ts`.

**Text-termination guard**: In build mode, the loop does NOT accept text-only
completions via `finishReason='stop'`. Instead it checks for:
1. Question-to-user patterns → autonomy violation nudge, loop continues
2. Description-not-doing patterns → action required nudge, loop continues
3. No real work done → nudge to use tools, loop continues
4. Work done but no task_complete → nudge to call the tool, loop continues
5. Incomplete todos → forces completion before accepting

Planning mode text termination is unchanged — plans legitimately end in text.

**Fallback path guard**: The `<action>` fallback path (for models without
native tool calling) applies the same guards when no `<action>` block is found
in the model output.

**Read-only loop detection**: A `consecutiveReads` counter increments on
`file_read`/`file_list` and resets on `file_write`/`file_edit`/`code_execute`.
At threshold 6, a system nudge tells the agent to stop reading and start
building. Only active in build mode.

**Double-fail prevention**: The runner catch block in `runner.ts` checks
whether the task is already in a terminal state (`completed`, `failed`,
`planned`) before emitting error/done events. This prevents the observed
double-fail pattern where `failRun()` inside the loop emits events and then
the runner catch fires again.

**appendMessage race fix**: `appendMessage()`, `compactMessages()`, and
`createUpload()` now use `INSERT ... RETURNING *` for PostgreSQL to avoid
the race condition where a re-SELECT could return a different row inserted
by a concurrent operation. SQLite keeps the existing re-SELECT (single-writer).

## 7. Agent tools (the only ones)

`file_read`, `file_write`, `file_edit`, `file_list`, `code_execute`
(bash/python under RESTRICTED HOST EXECUTION in a per-task workspace: env whitelist + path
boundaries + dangerous-command blocklist), `http_request`, `browser`, `task_complete`.
`browser` uses the optional loopback extension and is read-only by default;
interaction requires an explicit user-granted policy. `task_complete` is called
exactly once, as a tool, never as text.

Workspace root per task: `$TASK_WORK_DIR/<taskId>` (default `/tmp/xeo-tasks`).
All file/code access is confined to that directory (realpath-checked).

## 8. Commands

- `npm run dev` — local dev.
- `npm run typecheck` — `tsc --noEmit`, must be clean.
- `npm run lint` — ESLint, must be clean (no warnings).
- `npm test` — vitest unit tests.
- `npm run build` — production build.
- `npm run db:init` — create schema + seed root admin from env.
- `go test ./...` in `native/runtime-broker` — broker auth and bind tests.

## 9. Definition of done

A user creates a task → agent executes it → credits are consumed correctly →
result is stored in history → admin can inspect and modify user state → all
users use the same global model → no duplicate writers, no silent failures →
typecheck + lint + tests + build all pass.

Tests must exercise the shipped implementation. A test that re-declares the
logic it is checking is not a test — it is a second copy that will silently
diverge (rule 1).

## 10. Intent-aware execution (core feature)

The agent supports Chat and Work surfaces that share the same execution engine but
never share unsafe defaults:

**Chat mode** (`mode=chat`):
- Conversational responses with read-only file, HTTP, and optional browser inspection.
- Never creates a plan for ordinary conversation and never writes or executes code.

**Work intake** (`surface=work`):
- Normal conversation remains Chat-like.
- Explicit planning starts `mode=planning` immediately.
- A direct execution request creates `status=awaiting_decision` and starts nothing.
- The UI offers a short, server-enforced 30-second choice: direct execution or
  planning first. Expiry closes the choice; it never defaults to execution.
- Ambiguous intent can request clarification or offer bounded choices before a run.

**Planning mode** (`mode=planning`):
- Tool access: file_read, file_list, http_request, browser, task_complete ONLY.
- Write tools are HARD-LOCKED at `executeTool` dispatch and throw if attempted.
- Produces a structured plan (objective, findings, steps, verification, risks).
- User must approve or reject before any writes occur.

**Build mode** (`mode=build`):
- Full tool access, but browser interaction remains separately policy-gated.
- Executes ONLY the `approved_plan` or the accepted `execution_brief`.
- Plan cannot be rewritten during execution — no dynamic re-planning.
- Ends with status=`completed` or `failed`.

**Approval gate:**
- Atomic conditional UPDATE: `approved_plan=plan, mode='build', status='pending'`
  guarded by `WHERE status='planned'` — prevents double-approval races.
- Reject sets status='failed' with the rejection reason.

**Session persistence:**
- Conversation history is persisted in the `messages` table (role + content per task).
- The agent loop loads full conversation history at start and injects it into the
  LLM context, so follow-up messages have full context from prior runs.
- Follow-up messages are allowed on completed/failed tasks — they reset the task
  to pending and start a new agent run with conversation history.

**Mode switching:**
- Users can switch modes at any time via `POST /tasks/:id/mode`.
- Switching to planning clears approved_plan, resets to pending, and auto-starts
  a new planning run. Switching to build is available for non-running tasks.
- Mode switching preserves conversation history, execution state, and session context.

**Why no execution_cursor:** The agent loop is model-driven — the LLM decides
what to do each iteration. There is no persisted step list, so a cursor would
be dead state that never drives execution (violates rule 9).

## 11. Context management (core feature)

The agent manages its context window natively — no patch layer, no wrapper,
no parallel subsystem.

**Context usage percentage** (`context_usage_percentage`):
- Derived from the canonical in-memory messages array the agent sends to the
  model. Uses ~4-chars-per-token estimation with per-message overhead.
- Emitted as a `context` event every iteration: `{ used_tokens, context_window,
  percentage, threshold }`. This is the single authoritative metric.
- No separate tracking engine. No fake/hardcoded indicator.

**Admin-configurable threshold** (`auto_compact_threshold`):
- Stored in `model_settings` row id=1 alongside model config (single source of
  truth — no new config subsystem).
- Clamped to [10, 95] to prevent bad values from disabling or thrashing.
- Default: 80%. Admin can change via the `/admin` UI.

**Automatic compaction**:
- When `context_usage_percentage >= auto_compact_threshold`, the agent loop
  triggers compaction automatically.
- Compaction: older messages are archived (`active=0`) and replaced with ONE
  system summary message (`active=1`) that preserves critical facts, user
  intent, execution state, and plan/mode awareness.
- The system prompt, approved plan, and mode state are NEVER touched.
- Summary is generated via the same LLM (using `COMPACTION_PROMPT`).
- Compaction events are emitted for observability: `{ archived, summary_tokens,
  before_percentage, after_percentage }`.

**Message ordering**:
- `getMessages()` returns ALL messages (active + archived) in chronological
  order — for UI display and audit.
- `getContextMessages()` returns only `active=1` messages — for the agent's
  LLM context each run.
- Compaction summary sorts naturally as the oldest context row (system role).

## 12. Adaptive execution boundary (no hardcoded limits)

The agent loop uses adaptive stagnation detection instead of fixed iteration caps.
There is NO numeric safety cap — termination is purely semantic.

**Termination signals (in priority order):**
1. `task_complete` tool call → normal completion.
2. `finishReason === 'stop'` with text → accepted as final answer.
3. Credit exhaustion → `failRun` with out-of-credits message.
4. Stagnation detection → escalated nudge, then termination if persistent.
5. Unhandled error → `failRun` with error message.

Credit economics is the primary execution budget. A productive agent with
sufficient credits runs until it finishes — no iteration counting.

**Stagnation detection:**
- Each iteration computes a tool-call fingerprint (tool names + first 100 chars of args).
- If the fingerprint matches the previous N iterations (default 3): stagnation detected.
- First escalation: a `STAGNATION_NUDGE` system message is injected into context.
- If stagnation continues for N more iterations after escalation: hard termination.
- When progress is made (different fingerprint): stagnation counter decreases.

**Why no numeric safety cap:**
- A numeric cap (even a high one) can terminate a productive agent that is making
  measurable forward progress every iteration.
- Credit exhaustion is the natural economic boundary — the admin controls the budget.
- Stagnation detection handles broken loops (same tool calls repeated).
- If the model never calls task_complete but keeps producing useful work, credits
  will eventually exhaust. The admin can always intervene manually.
- The old hardcoded limit of 25 iterations prematurely terminated complex tasks.
- The intermediate safety cap of 200 was also architecturally wrong — a productive
  agent at iteration 201 should not be killed.

**Escalation model:**
- Stagnation detected → inject nudge → model adjusts approach → continue.
- If model doesn't adjust → stagnation persists → terminate with descriptive error.
- The nudge explicitly tells the model to: change approach, call task_complete, or explain blockers.

## 13. Memory and effective context (core feature)

Memory makes the agent more useful over time without letting it learn silently.

**Approval gate.** A run proposes bounded candidates at `task_complete`
(`persistMemoryCandidates` in `lib/agent/run/memory.ts`), written as `status='proposed'`.
`getActiveAgentMemories()` filters on `status='active'`, so a proposed memory is
structurally incapable of reaching run context. The only transition from
proposed to active is an explicit user decision through
`POST /api/tasks/:id/memory`, which is idempotent (409 on a second decision) and
emits a `memory_decision` event.

**Injection is visible.** When approved memories or instructions are compiled
into a run, the loop emits a `context_layers` event naming them. Memory that
acts invisibly is the failure mode this feature exists to prevent.

**One resolution pass.** `resolveContext()` in `lib/agent/context-pack.ts` is the
single source of truth (rule 1). `compileAgentContext()` renders the prompt from
it for the agent loop; `describeEffectiveContext()` reports it to the Context
Inspector. The inspector therefore cannot claim a layer the model did not
receive — both read the same resolution.

**Deterministic layer states.** Each layer resolves to `active`, `excluded`,
`overridden`, or `duplicate` with a reason:
- scope specificity (a task instruction is more specific than a global one with
  the same name),
- disabled flags,
- approval status and expiry,
- byte-identical duplicate content,
- character-budget clamping.

There is no model-based conflict detection. Xeo does not guess whether two
instructions disagree semantically, and it must not claim to.

**Guidance is not authority.** Instructions, memories, profiles, and skills are
context only. None of them can grant a capability, change tool policy, or alter
approval state. Tool access is enforced at dispatch, never by prompt text.

## 14. Runtime state reporting

Chat and Work never display a generic `thinking...`. `deriveChatRuntime()` in
`lib/agent/runtime-state.ts` derives the visible state deterministically from the
event stream: the last event type, its payload, and how long ago it arrived.

States: `idle`, `queued`, `connecting`, `reading_context`, `using_tool`,
`receiving`, `waiting_for_provider`, `retrying`, `compacting`, `completed`,
`failed`.

The server's task status is authoritative for terminal state — the UI never
invents completion. After `PROVIDER_STALL_MS` (10s) of silence the state becomes
`waiting_for_provider` and offers retry, so a stalled provider is named rather
than hidden behind an animation.

## 15. Event registry (frontend/backend contract)

`lib/agent/events.ts` is the single declaration of every task event the frontend
knows about. It exists because `WorkClient` and `ChatClient` each carried a
hardcoded array of event type strings; when v1.10.0 added `context_layers`,
`memory`, and `memory_decision`, neither array was updated, so those events were
persisted, streamed over SSE, and silently discarded by the browser.

Rules:

1. Every `emitTaskEvent` type MUST be declared in `AGENT_EVENT_TYPES`.
   `test/events.test.ts` scans `lib/` and `app/` for emit sites and fails on an
   undeclared type.
2. Surfaces subscribe via `eventTypesFor('chat' | 'work')`. A literal array of
   event names in a component is a bug.
3. Payloads are read through the typed readers (`readContextLayers`,
   `readToolCall`, …). Components must not index into `data` and guess key names.
4. `describeEvent()` is the one mapping from event to product language, so the
   timeline, the runtime banner, and the activity list cannot describe the same
   event differently.
5. Events that carry no standalone meaning (`text`, `reasoning`, `task_status`)
   return `null` from `describeEvent` and render nothing. The UI never pads the
   activity list to look busy.

## 16. UI truth rules

The interface must never imply a capability or result the backend does not
provide.

- `authorityForMode()` in `components/AgentPrimitives.tsx` mirrors what
  `executeTool` enforces at dispatch. It reports browser interaction as `gated`,
  never `allowed`, because interaction requires a separate policy grant. Its
  reason text must not use the word "sandbox".
- `deriveFlow()` marks a stage done only when the corresponding state is
  observable: a context event, a stored plan, a frozen `approved_plan`, a
  `tool_call`, or a terminal status. It is not a step counter.
- `RuntimeBanner` states plainly that nothing executed during a provider stall
  rather than animating over silence.
- `ResultArtifact` renders only the facts its caller supplies from observed
  evidence. A run with no verification event must not display a verification
  fact.
- A component that lacks a backend value renders nothing rather than a
  placeholder.
## 17. Settings visibility rule (v1.25)

Any governance-critical feature — a new autonomy/authority surface, an
isolation tier, a delegation mode, a safety policy — must ship with a
visible Settings section from day one. It may also appear in the task-start
form, but never ONLY there. A capability the operator cannot inspect and
configure outside of a task-creation flow is a buried capability, and
buried capabilities become invisible authority. The Sandbox and Subagents
sections (07/08) exist because this rule was violated by their absence.
