# CLAUDE.md — AIAssistant

Project rules and context for Claude Code. This file is also loaded by the runtime
assistant (it uses `setting_sources=["project"]`), so keep it accurate and concise.

## What this is
A personal AI assistant that **reviews Email, Jira, and GitHub — read-only, with a sanctioned
Jira-write exception** — built on the Claude Agent SDK (Python). Frontends: terminal CLI now,
Telegram next; deploys to EC2.

## Cardinal rule: READ-ONLY for external services
Email/GitHub/PostHog must remain read-only. This is enforced structurally, not by convention:
- Every third-party tool in `src/aiassistant/tools/` hits **GET endpoints only** (except the two
  sanctioned exceptions below). Never add a tool that sends mail or merges/comments/pushes on
  GitHub.
- The runtime agent has **no Bash** (`disallowed_tools=["Bash",...]` in `agent.py`), so external
  services can't be mutated out-of-band. Do not re-enable Bash for the agent.
- Local filesystem writes (e.g. `.claude/skills/`) ARE allowed — that's how the assistant grows.
- **Sanctioned exception — A Better Meal (`tools/abm.py`):** the user's OWN app (recipe &
  meal-plan product). Full READ + WRITE granted explicitly by the user. Spec-driven gateway over
  `src/aiassistant/swaggers/abm.json` (~450 endpoints): `abm_find_endpoints` →
  `abm_describe_endpoint` → `abm_request` (any method, validated against the spec). Auth = the
  app's login endpoint (`ABM_USERNAME`/`ABM_PASSWORD`, DRF token, auto-refresh on 401). This
  exception is scoped to ABM only — it does not weaken the rule for the other services.
- **Sanctioned exception — Jira writes (`tools/jira.py`):** explicitly granted by the user
  (July 2026). Exactly four write tools: `jira_add_comment`, `jira_transition_issue`,
  `jira_update_issue`, `jira_create_issue`. **No delete tools, ever.** The assistant confirms
  before writing (see the `jira-review` skill). Email/GitHub/PostHog remain strictly read-only,
  and the `jira-reporter` subagent keeps its read-only tool list.

## Architecture
```
src/aiassistant/
  config.py          loads .env; readiness checks; MEMORY_DIR / STATE_DIR / PROMPTS_DIR
  agent.py           builds ClaudeAgentOptions; aggregates tools; session resume + memory priming
  prompts.py         prompt manager — loads prompts/*.md (prompts NOT hardcoded in .py)
  prompts/           system_append.md · daily_summary.md  (editable prompt text)
  tools/             github.py · gmail.py · posthog.py (GET-only) · jira.py (read + sanctioned writes) · memory.py (local writes)
  interfaces/        cli.py (REPL, --continue) · telegram.py (long-poll bot)
  workflows/         daily_summary.py  (runnable, scheduleable workflows)
.claude/skills/      email/jira/github/posthog-review · skill-builder · daily-summary · web-research · memory
.claude/agents/      pr-reviewer · inbox-triager · jira-reporter · github-digest · web-researcher
memory/              durable facts (one .md per fact + MEMORY.md index) — gitignored
.aiassistant/        runtime state (chat -> session_id map) — gitignored
scripts/auth_gmail.py · deploy/aiassistant.service · tests/
```

## Subagents
Project subagents live in `.claude/agents/<name>.md` (YAML frontmatter: `name`,
`description` = when to delegate, `tools` = comma-separated allow-list, `model`).
They're discovered via `setting_sources=["project"]`, so they work in BOTH the
interactive session and the runtime assistant (which has the `Task` tool allowed
in `agent.py`). Keep any GitHub/Jira/Gmail subagent restricted to the GET-only
`mcp__assistant__*` tools. Source specialists: `inbox-triager` (email),
`jira-reporter` (Jira), `github-digest` (GitHub activity), `pr-reviewer` (single PR).

## Prompts (`prompts.py` + `prompts/*.md`)
Prompts are NOT hardcoded in Python. Edit the markdown in `src/aiassistant/prompts/` and load it
with `prompts.get("<name>")` (cached; `prompts.reload()` re-reads). Each Python use-site has a
comment pointing at its file (e.g. `# prompts/system_append.md`). Use `{{placeholder}}` (double
braces) for variables so single-brace JSON/code in a prompt is left intact. Override the whole
directory with `AIASSISTANT_PROMPTS_DIR`. When adding a prompt: create `prompts/<name>.md` and
reference it via `prompts.get("<name>")` — never paste prompt text back into a `.py` file.

## Memory (layered, Claude-practice)
Three layers give the assistant continuity across restarts:
1. **Short-term — session resume.** `Assistant(resume_key=..., resume=True)` maps a conversation
   key (`"cli"`, `"tg:<chat_id>"`) to the CLI session id in `.aiassistant/sessions.json` and passes
   `resume=<id>` so conversations survive restarts. CLI: `aiassistant --continue`; Telegram resumes
   per chat automatically.
2. **Long-term — durable memory.** `tools/memory.py` stores one markdown fact per file under
   `MEMORY_DIR` with a regenerated `MEMORY.md` index, exposed as `memory_save / memory_recall /
   memory_list / memory_forget`. The index is **primed into the system prompt** at startup
   (`_system_prompt()` in `agent.py`), and the `memory` skill governs when to save/recall.
   This is the ONE place writes are allowed — Email/Jira/GitHub stay read-only.
3. **Context compaction** — handled by the SDK; enable tool-result clearing / a `PreCompact` hook
   later if long sessions approach the window.

Memory rules: never store secrets or raw untrusted email/web content (store the distilled fact, to
avoid poisoning); keep facts fresh (overwrite by title, `memory_forget` stale ones); recall before
duplicating. `daily-summary` recalls yesterday's brief for a "since yesterday" delta and saves today's.

## Workflows
A "workflow" has two parts: a declarative skill that orchestrates subagents
(`.claude/skills/daily-summary/`) and a thin runnable driver in
`src/aiassistant/workflows/` that runs it headlessly (for cron / Telegram).
`daily-summary` fans out to the three source specialists in parallel and
synthesizes one prioritized brief. Run: `python -m aiassistant.workflows.daily_summary`
or `aiassistant-daily`. To add another, mirror this pair (skill + driver).

## MCP servers (`.mcp.json`)
`.mcp.json` configures three official **remote** MCP servers for the INTERACTIVE Claude Code
session (working *on* this repo): `github` (`api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/`, Bearer
`${GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN}`), `atlassian` (`mcp.atlassian.com/v1/mcp/authv2`, OAuth), and
`gmail` (`gmailmcp.googleapis.com/mcp/v1`, OAuth — Developer Preview). Authenticate the OAuth ones
with `/mcp`.
- These servers are **WRITE-capable** — they are a developer convenience, NOT the assistant's
  read-only integrations.
- **They never reach the deployed assistant.** `agent.py` sets `strict_mcp_config=True`, so the
  runtime uses ONLY the in-process GET-only `mcp__assistant__*` tools and ignores `.mcp.json`,
  plugins, and connectors. Do not remove `strict_mcp_config=True` — it's load-bearing for the
  read-only guarantee. (Verified: the runtime sees only `mcp__assistant__*`.)
- To keep even the interactive GitHub server read-only, denylist its write tools via `/permissions`
  (the remote server has no read-only mode).

## Rules (`.claude/rules/`)
Granular, path-scoped working agreements live in `.claude/rules/` and auto-load when you edit the
files they govern (interactive Claude Code only — the SDK runtime doesn't load them, which is why
the read-only Cardinal rule above stays in this file):
- `python.md` → `src|scripts|tests/**/*.py` — venv, style, async tools, token-lean, verify-by-running.
- `tools-readonly.md` → `tools/**/*.py` — GET-only mandate, new-tool checklist, clear failures.
- `skills-and-agents.md` → `.claude/{skills,agents}/**` — descriptions-as-triggers, read-only specialists.
- `workflows.md` → `.claude/workflows/**`, `workflows/**` — the two-layer model, workflow-script specifics.
- General: commit only when asked (`Co-Authored-By` trailer, no secrets staged); ask before
  destructive/outward actions; prefer editing over creating.

## Conventions
- **Tool results:** return via the `_ok(payload)` / `_err(msg)` helpers in each tools module
  (shape: `{"content":[{"type":"text","text": ...}]}`). Keep payloads slim — summarize fields,
  cap large bodies (see `_decode_body` in `gmail.py`) to control token usage.
- **Optional deps lazy-imported:** Google (`gmail.py`) and Telegram (`telegram.py`) imports happen
  inside functions so the core runs without them installed.
- **Adding a tool:** define it with `@tool(...)` in the right `tools/*.py`, append to that module's
  `ALL_TOOLS`, and it's auto-registered via `_ALL_TOOLS` in `agent.py`. Also add its
  `mcp__assistant__<name>` to `allowed_tools` in `agent.py`.
- **Adding a skill:** create `.claude/skills/<kebab-name>/SKILL.md` with `name`/`description`
  frontmatter (description = the trigger). Or just ask the assistant ("add a skill that …") →
  `skill-builder` does it. Picked up on next start.

## Commands
- Run CLI: `python -m aiassistant`
- Run Telegram bot: `python -m aiassistant.interfaces.telegram`
- Tests: `python -m pytest -v -s` (Jira/Gmail self-skip until configured)
- Lint/format: `ruff format . && ruff check --fix .`

## Security
- Never commit secrets. `.env`, `gmail_token.json`, `credentials.json`, `client_secret*.json` are
  gitignored and blocked from the Read/Write tools by `.claude/hooks/guard_secrets.py`.
- `config.py` reads `.env` directly via python-dotenv (not the Read tool), so the guard doesn't
  break runtime config loading.
