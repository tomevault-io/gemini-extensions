This repository builds `wmux`: a cross-OS terminal multiplexer with a
Windows-first implementation path and an OS-neutral core.

Architecture and behavior are defined by wmux's product requirements, tests,
documented contracts, relevant standards, and official platform documentation.
Prior art may inform research, but another product must not define wmux's
identity or compatibility contract.

The goal is to build a persistent terminal virtualization server:

```text
persistent server
  -> disposable clients
  -> sessions
  -> windows
  -> panes
  -> server-owned virtual terminal state
  -> renderer per attached client
```

## Product Ethos

`wmux` is a serious terminal multiplexer, not a toy pane splitter.

It should let developers keep long-running shells, servers, logs, build jobs,
agents, and project workspaces alive across terminal restarts.

The product promise is:

```text
Consistent multiplexer semantics across supported operating systems.
Native platform integration for terminals, processes, and IPC.
No POSIX emulation dependency.
Core designed for cross-OS support from day one.
```

The wrong promise is byte-for-byte equivalence between Unix and Windows PTYs,
signals, process groups, shell job control, or file descriptor passing.

## Non-Negotiable Architecture Rules

1. Core code must not import Windows APIs.
2. Core code must not import Unix APIs.
3. Core objects use stable IDs, not raw platform handles.
4. The server is the only authority for sessions, windows, panes, grids,
   layouts, options, command queues, paste buffers, jobs, and clients.
5. Clients are disposable views. Losing a client must not kill pane processes
   unless explicitly requested.
6. A pane is a virtual terminal, not just a child process.
7. Child output is parsed into an internal screen/grid. The attached terminal is
   only a renderer.
8. Commands mutate state through a serialized server-side command queue.
9. IPC is versioned from the start.
10. Platform mechanisms are exposed to core as OS-neutral semantic events.
11. Windows first means Windows backend first, not Windows-only architecture.

## Critical Boundary

The platform backend owns OS mechanics only:

```text
ConPTY / PTY handles
process spawning
process cleanup
named pipes / Unix sockets
terminal raw mode
console or termios mode restoration
credential checks
```

The core owns multiplexer semantics:

```text
sessions
windows
winlinks
panes
layouts
screen/grid
VT parser
redraw model
commands
options
formats
key tables
copy mode
paste buffers
hooks
control mode
```

Do not repeat the old design mistake where the PTY/process wrapper owns the
terminal engine or screen. The PTY backend should emit bytes/events. The core
pane should own parser, screen, grid, scrollback, mode state, and dirty state.

Correct flow:

```text
ConPTY bytes
  -> PtyEvent::Output
  -> core pane VT parser
  -> screen-write operations
  -> pane screen/grid
  -> redraw builder
  -> client terminal renderer
```

Incorrect flow:

```text
ConPTY object
  -> owns terminal grid
  -> renderer reaches into platform process for screen state
```

## Rust Workspace Shape

Preserve the crate boundaries:

```text
crates/wmux-core
  OS-neutral server state, panes, sessions, layouts, parser, grid, commands.

crates/wmux-protocol
  Versioned framed IPC messages and codec.

crates/wmux-platform
  OS-neutral platform traits and semantic event types.

crates/wmux-windows
  Windows ConPTY, CreateProcessW, Job Objects, named pipes, console modes.

crates/wmux-unix
  Unix PTY, process groups, signals, Unix sockets, and termios.

crates/wmux-server
  Persistent daemon/server runtime.

crates/wmux-client
  Disposable CLI/attach client.

crates/wmux-cli
  Shared CLI parsing.

crates/wmux-config
  Configuration loading, defaults, and validation.

crates/wmux-bench, crates/wmux-conformance, crates/wmux-stress
  Performance, semantic-conformance, and deterministic stress harnesses.
```

## Server State Model

Use stable IDs and centralized stores.

Prefer:

```rust
struct ServerState {
    sessions: Store<SessionId, Session>,
    windows: Store<WindowId, Window>,
    winlinks: Store<WinlinkId, Winlink>,
    panes: Store<PaneId, Pane>,
    clients: Store<ClientId, Client>,
}
```

Avoid cyclic Rust ownership graphs. Keep ownership in centralized stores and
resolve relationships through stable IDs. Indexes are display metadata only;
they are not ownership identity.

## Event And Command Discipline

The server event loop is the only state mutator.

Allowed event producers:

```text
PTY readers      -> pane output events
IPC handlers     -> client command / attach input events
resize watchers  -> client resize events
timers           -> timer events
terminal readers -> client input events
```

Forbidden:

```text
PTY reader directly changing active pane
IPC handler directly killing panes
renderer directly mutating layout
input decoder directly mutating sessions/windows
random task touching server-owned state
```

All user actions should become commands. Commands must resolve targets through
a target-resolution subsystem, not through ad hoc lookups in each command.

## Pane And Terminal Model

A pane owns a virtual terminal:

```text
pane id
window id
layout cell
backend pane id
terminal parser
screen/grid
scrollback
alternate screen
dirty state
mode stack
copy/search state
process exit state
```

Do not treat pane output as raw text. Child processes emit arbitrary terminal
byte streams. Parse them into a server-owned screen model.

Performance comes from chunked IO and batched rendering:

```text
read chunks
parse in a tight loop
fast-path printable runs
mark dirty regions
coalesce redraws
batch terminal writes
```

Do not create one task, allocation, redraw, IPC frame, or terminal write per
byte.

## Rendering Rules

The server grid is the source of truth. Clients are physical terminal views with
their own baselines.

Attach, reattach, resize, layout change, and window switch must render the
current scene from authoritative server state. Do not replay raw pane history to
reconstruct a client.

Renderer caches are client-scoped. A cache valid for one client says nothing
about another client.

If a partial update cannot be proven correct against a client's known baseline,
render a coherent current scene.

## Windows-First Backend Rules

Windows mechanisms:

```text
Unix PTY       -> ConPTY
fork/exec      -> CreateProcessW
signals        -> process handles, Job Objects, control events where possible
Unix sockets   -> named pipes or Windows AF_UNIX
termios        -> Windows console input/output modes plus VT mode
process groups -> Job Objects and process groups where useful
```

Every pane process tree should be owned by a Job Object where Windows allows it.
Killing a pane/window/session/server must clean up child processes reliably.

Every inherited handle must be intentional. Handle ownership must be explicit
and idempotent.

## Change Discipline

Preserve the dependency direction from platform mechanics through the
server-owned terminal model to disposable client rendering. Product polish
must not bypass persistent state, versioned IPC, command serialization, or
the virtual terminal model.

## Testing Expectations

Add tests in proportion to risk.

High-priority test areas:

```text
protocol framing
server state transitions
command parsing
target resolution
layout invariants
VT parser sequences
screen/grid mutation
Unicode width
detach/reattach lifecycle
ConPTY EOF/exit races
process cleanup
resize storms
slow-client backpressure
```

Malformed IPC and malformed terminal bytes must never crash the server.

## Engineering Standard

Prefer simple, explicit boundaries over clever abstractions.

Build the smallest layer that can be tested, then continue upward. Keep
platform details narrow. Keep core semantic state authoritative. Preserve
determinism in command execution and server state mutation.

When changing architecture, update the docs and tests in the same change.

## Research Discipline For Fixes And Additions

Before making any feature, fix, or improvement, especially in terminal input,
rendering, ConPTY/PTY handling, key bindings, paste, resize, detach/attach,
sessions/windows/panes, layouts, command parsing, or server lifecycle behavior,
research the relevant wmux contracts and external standards first.

Required references:

```text
existing wmux code, tests, architecture documents, and invariants
official terminal, protocol, language, and library documentation
official platform documentation where OS mechanics matter
current product and architecture documentation in this repository
```

Start from the user problem and wmux's architecture rather than assuming another
product's behavior is required. Study prior art when useful, validate license
constraints, and record the chosen model without competitor branding. Do not
guess through hotfixes. Make whatever scoped change is required to preserve the
server-owned state model and cross-OS contract.
