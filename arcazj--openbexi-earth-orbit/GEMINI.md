This file provides repository guidance for Claude Code and other coding agents working on OpenBEXI Earth Orbit.

## Commands

Install the locked dependency graph:

```powershell
npm ci
```

Run the complete policy/build checks and test suites:

```powershell
npm run check
npm test
```

Run focused suites when iterating:

```powershell
npm run test:unit
npm run test:python
npm run test:browser
npm run benchmark:full-catalog -- --output artifacts/full-catalog-benchmark.json
npm run benchmark:v21-service -- --output artifacts/v21-service-benchmark.json
```

Python-backed npm commands share `scripts/python-discovery.mjs`: `OPENBEXI_PYTHON_COMMAND` is tried first, followed by `py -3` on Windows, `python3`, `python`, and recognized installed Windows Python directories. Only Python 3 is accepted. `npm run test:browser` reuses an existing healthy loopback server on `OPENBEXI_TEST_PORT` when one is available; otherwise its lifecycle runner starts Python directly and terminates only the server child it created.

Supply-chain and static-artifact commands:

```powershell
npm run audit:dependencies
npm run sbom -- --output release/evidence/openbexi-node-sbom-2.3.2-development.cdx.json
npm run build
npm run check:release-tree -- --tree HEAD --require-clean
npm run rehearse:rollback
py -m http.server 8001 --bind 127.0.0.1 --directory dist
```

Serve the source application with the optional Python API:

```powershell
npm run serve
npm run serve:update
# http://127.0.0.1:8000/index.html
```

The v2.1 full-catalog workspace requires at least one configured token; job submission requires an analyst or administrator token. Values must be unique and at least 24 characters. `server.py` reads the process environment and does not load `.env.example`:

```powershell
$env:OPENBEXI_API_VIEWER_TOKEN = "replace-with-an-independent-random-viewer-token"
$env:OPENBEXI_API_ANALYST_TOKEN = "replace-with-an-independent-random-analyst-token"
$env:OPENBEXI_API_ADMIN_TOKEN = "replace-with-an-independent-random-admin-token"
npm run serve
```

Use `--no-v21-service` for the legacy/static API boundary. Keep `runtime/`, tokens, cursor secrets, database files, and runner artifacts private and uncommitted.

For static source hosting without API routes:

```powershell
py -m http.server 8000 --bind 127.0.0.1
```

Data maintenance:

```powershell
py tools/satellite_data_tools.py export-gp --dry-run
py tools/satellite_data_tools.py export-gp --force
py tools/satellite_data_tools.py export-tle --dry-run
py tools/satellite_data_tools.py export-tle --all
py tools/satellite_data_tools.py build-launches --dry-run
py tools/satellite_data_tools.py build-decayed-db --all
py tools/satellite_data_tools.py build-decayed-db --refresh-satcat --force
py tools/satellite_data_tools.py build-tracked --dry-run
py tools/satellite_data_tools.py build-tracked --all
py tools/satellite_data_tools.py maybe-update --dry-run --interval-hours 24 --reconciliation-interval-hours 24
py tools/satellite_data_tools.py stage-update --dry-run
py tools/satellite_data_tools.py import-candidate
py tools/satellite_data_tools.py validate-candidate <candidate_id>
py tools/satellite_data_tools.py promote-candidate <candidate_id>
```

`export-gp` remains the position source in Version 2.3.2. It requests `active`, `fengyun-1c-debris`, `iridium-33-debris`, and `cosmos-2251-debris`; the event groups are only a partial positioned-debris subset. `build-tracked` derives the searchable SATCAT inventory from local snapshots and makes no provider request. It must record the GP groups that produced the accepted catalog, not merely the configured desired groups. `export-tle` is deprecated compatibility coverage. Numeric and Space-Track Alpha-5 fields are decoded to canonical full NORAD strings, but TLE remains an incomplete subset of current six-digit GP/OMM coverage. Direct maintenance commands above operate on their supplied data root. The opt-in server scheduler instead seeds a private revisioned candidate, runs maintenance only there, validates the complete candidate closure, and atomically promotes a private runtime pointer; it must not rewrite checked-in release data.

For startup performance diagnostics, open `http://127.0.0.1:8000/index.html?perf=1`, then run:

```javascript
window.openbexiStartupPerformance.summary()
```

## Architecture

### Runtime and deployment

The source application is plain HTML, CSS, and browser ES modules. There is no JavaScript bundler, but `npm run build` creates the curated deterministic `dist/` artifact defined by `release/static-artifact.json`.

`js/dependencyBootstrap.js` prefers exact integrity-checked Three.js and satellite.js files under `vendor/`. Source/server mode can use exact-version CDN URLs only as an explicit fallback. The generated static artifact is packaged-only, same-origin-only, and must not execute remote runtime code. Never use `file://`; modules, Workers, JSON, textures, and models require HTTP.

### Coordinate and scientific boundaries

Visualization positions use an Earth-centered frame with Three.js Y/Z axes swapped:

```text
scene = (orbital.x, orbital.z, orbital.y) * KM_TO_SCENE_UNITS
```

Earth remains at `(0, 0, 0)`. ECF visualization geometry is rotated about scene Y by `-GMST`. Reusable visualization coordinate, orientation, and framing math belongs in `js/sceneFrame.js`; shared scale constants belong in `js/SatelliteConstantLoader.js`.

Conjunction calculations do not use scene coordinates. They propagate both objects at the same UTC instant and compare raw satellite.js/SGP4 TEME position and velocity states in kilometers and kilometers per second. Keep frame, time, units, provenance, element age, and algorithm version explicit. Never infer physical encounters from orbit lines, sprites, camera state, or scene scale.

`js/simulationClock.js` owns the browser simulation instant and signed rate. Advance it once per animation frame, mirror its state into the reused `SIM_DATE`, and make every time-dependent visualization consume that instant. Solar System mode applies the finite bundled ephemeris bounds and pauses at a reached boundary; never extrapolate JPL-derived positions. `js/orbit/satelliteMotionInterpolator.js` is a display scheduler: the selected object uses an exact SGP4 state at each simulation frame, while other filter-visible objects may use Hermite interpolation between asynchronously sampled SGP4 states under an orbit-period-fraction window cap. Treat filter eligibility and current-epoch render readiness separately; a newly materialized per-record `Object3D` state/selection proxy starts hidden, and filter re-admission after a paused UTC jump stays hidden until a finite sample covering that instant commits. The Globe renders ready proxies through one batched `THREE.Points` layer. From 0 through 499 drawn/render-ready objects, its detailed path uses the bundled same-origin `icons/ob_satellite.png` alpha silhouette at a fixed 16 screen pixels with `sizeAttenuation: false`; only the texture alpha is sampled, so exact per-vertex object-type and selected colors remain authoritative. At 500 or more, it removes the map, restores `sizeAttenuation: true`, and uses perspective-attenuated compact density size `0.025`. The procedural white-alpha circle is a load-failure fallback only. Both paths remain color-only and make no per-type shape or selection-ring claim. On replacement, dispose point geometry/material and any loader-owned sprite texture, never an injected/shared resource. Cancel superseded sampling jobs on rate/selection changes without hiding valid in-window interpolation. Expose cadence-limited coverage at high warp rather than stretching the window silently. Hide invalid propagation instead of displaying a stale/Earth-center marker, retry with bounded backoff, and restore only after finite recovery under the current filters. Do not reset the selected retry deadline on every frame; corrected propagation must be able to recover at the unchanged simulation instant after backoff. Mercator consumes the same display positions; it does not start another catalog propagation pass. Through 1,000 drawable records, detailed Mercator may use type glyphs and selection rings; above that threshold it uses compact color-only density paths plus the detailed selected marker and skips per-object icons, sorting, and non-selected labels. A failed selected-track rebuild clears the prior cached path and records the attempted satellite/instant so a redraw loop cannot retry it continuously. Interpolated scene positions must never enter screening, exports, provenance, or scientific result calculation.

Version 2.0 browser screening and Version 2.1 durable screening are `Experimental` and non-operational. They report geometric TCA, miss distance, and relative velocity. Collision probability is unavailable without validated covariance and hard-body-radius inputs. Do not present either workflow as operational collision prediction, maneuver advice, or complete catalog coverage.

Version 2.1 full-catalog screening requires UTC and a common TEME frame. OMM is eligible only under the explicit SGP4/UTC/TEME contract. OEM/provider tables can be parsed and interpolated in supported explicit frames, but the runner rejects non-TEME selected records and performs no frame/time conversion. A `SUCCEEDED` job can contain a `PARTIAL` scientific result; always preserve errors, unscreened intervals, motion-bound violations, caps, source status, and quality flags.

## Development Rules

- Change release identity in `release/version.json`, run `npm run version:sync`, and verify with `npm run check:version`. `PROMPT_History.md` is historical context, not a runtime version source.
- Treat the v2.0, v2.1, v2.2, v2.3, and v2.3.2 engineering checklists as separate gates. Later development authorization never promotes an earlier version. `Test_and_Integration.md` preserves the historical regression record and current v2.3.2 integration matrix.
- Keep the current release boundary: Version 2.3.2 is development, Experimental, and non-operational, with null candidate/release dates. Owner `arcazj` approved exactly one publication of the final post-recording Version 2.3.2 repository source bytes to `origin/master` after the warned pre-approval manifest SHA-256 `c456703d12602e83a73233f693cf684315565436d8c08c645a0b7e5d984d8177`. The authenticated GitHub Pages API changed `build_type` from legacy branch-root publishing to `workflow` before push, but the source-only decision does not approve or dispatch the manual Pages artifact. Version 2.3.2 adds persistent coverage presentation, virtualized results, direct Globe/Mercator selection, expanded orbit-scoped debris facets, private validated scheduler candidates, and an artifact-only Pages path. Authoritative local evidence records 63/63 JavaScript unit files; 151 passes plus one intentional Windows symlink-capability skip across 152 Python cases in 83.452 seconds; 49 Playwright declarations with 29 passes, 20 intentional skips, no unexpected/flaky/top-level errors, and one attempt each in 595,996.319 ms; 147 syntax-checked JavaScript files; zero dependency vulnerabilities; passing release engineering; the 976.75 ms/95.89 MiB 120k observation; and a 334-artifact/17-executable/94-evidence validation inventory. Final local rollback passed and local attestation records `localExact=true`, `remoteExact=false`. Remote Pages deployment/attestation, required-reviewer/self-review environment settings, clean committed-tree binding, named profiles, and independent review remain pending. Later changed or refreshed bytes require new approval. Pc/CDM/covariance, alerts, reports, maneuver recommendations, provider-completeness claims, mass/weight inference, candidate/stable promotion, and operational use remain unauthorized.
- Add or update deterministic tests for every behavioral change. `npm run test:unit` auto-discovers `tests/*.test.js`; Python and browser suites run separately or through `npm test`.
- Preserve the single-node durable contract: SQLite is the queue/source of truth; all worker mutations require current attempt and worker ownership; result imports are atomic and checksum bound; static mode must remain functional.
- Namespace persisted event-revision IDs by job/attempt while retaining engine event identity. Completed replay must create distinct immutable rows rather than collide with or overwrite the original job.
- Preserve catalog privacy and lifecycle semantics: API responses strip private artifact paths; normal GP/TLE updates are incremental `PARTIAL` upserts, while GP pruning requires structurally valid, quarantine-free responses from all four configured groups and records `COMPLETE` only for that partial configured scope. Launch and confirmed-decay history is never pruned by a later SATCAT omission. Coalesce SATCAT-derived work into one request per scheduler cycle and derive tracked chunks locally from the accepted SATCAT plus current GP. Successful GP, compatibility TLE, SATCAT, tracked, launch, or decay promotion changes the server composite `data_revision`, while `catalog_revision` remains GP-only compatibility. Conditional, byte-identical, failed, or rejected updates keep data bytes/revisions and last-known-good artifacts stable; metadata may record the check. Keep `source_groups` separate from accepted-byte `catalog_source_groups`; until `source_scope_verified` becomes true through one complete four-group success, stay due, do not reuse active-only validators, and do not accept `304`-only scope migration. Before serving any tracked manifest, metadata, or chunk through API or `server.py` static aliases, require one valid closure whose manifest/metadata revisions and current GP/SATCAT source lineage agree, hash-check the raw GP/SATCAT bytes against their sidecars, and serve the exact validated manifest/metadata snapshot; otherwise return bounded `503 TRACKED_CATALOG_UNAVAILABLE` and let the browser stay GP-only. Never synthesize TLE or truncate identifiers. Decode explicit Alpha-5 TLE fields to canonical full strings, but do not treat that compatibility subset as complete six-digit coverage. GP group/tag enrichment may join only by the complete canonical NORAD string and must record its compatibility source/tag-map revisions and match counts.
- Preserve the production-scale replacement guard for GP, TLE, and SATCAT: once the prior catalog has at least 1,000 records, full/reconciliation candidates need both 75% size and 75% canonical NORAD overlap. `--force` never bypasses it. Keep `--allow-large-catalog-shrink` confined to reviewed direct `export-gp`, `export-tle`, and `refresh-satcat` recovery; do not add it to `maybe-update` or server arguments. Keep collision-safe backups at the newest seven per changed fixed-name artifact, retain bounded manifest-referenced tracked chunk closures, treat accepted `304` revalidation as successful freshness that resets due age without byte/revision/backup churn, and preserve restart-persistent, recursively redacted status errors for GP/TLE/SATCAT/tracked/launch/decay including nested results.
- Keep scheduled provider access explicit: `npm run serve` is offline/default, `npm run serve:update` opts into daily GP/TLE/SATCAT/tracked update and complete configured-scope reconciliation, and `--no-data-update` wins. Request every configured GP group at most once per due cycle. Each cycle must seed one private revisioned candidate, run the updater against that isolated root, validate all required data/meta revision pairs plus tracked closure and current GP/SATCAT lineage, then atomically replace the private current pointer only after success. Cancellation, rejection, degradation, drift, interruption, or pointer failure must preserve the previous pointer and checked-in release bytes. Data routes must resolve through one registered coherent root and use the checked-in closure when no valid pointer exists. Under default `serve`, mutable data and `/api/v1` requests recheck the verified pointer; bootstrap or transactionally activate V21 before committing a changed root, retain the prior root on failure, retry on the next qualifying request, and support A to B to A existing-revision activation. Request-time coordinator errors are not public scheduler status. Preserve the outer data plane's persistent regular lock file and held nonblocking Windows/POSIX advisory lock: never unlink or reclaim it, and never treat stale owner text as authority over the OS lock. Keep the candidate-local updater's separate stale-owner recovery semantics distinct. If scheduler-path post-promotion V21 registration fails, retain the completed pointer selection, report the cycle degraded with registration pending, and retry the callback on the next scheduler pass even if no update is due; clear pending/error state only after success. Preserve independent dataset clocks/status, bounded retry/backoff, retry-eligible failed source-scope migration, background startup after bind, cooperative cancellation, and worker join before HTTP close. Restart remains the recommended operator rollback boundary. Static hosting, including GitHub Pages, cannot run this scheduler.
- Preserve the explicit Version 2.3.2 data-state distinctions in `release/evidence/v2.3.2-data-candidate-recovery.json`. Candidate `20260902T014734Z-9faea7cdb724` is the pinned no-network exact-`95b4303` closure: `VALIDATED`, deliberately unpromoted, zero source-copy mismatches, and not quarantined. Candidate `20260902T011924Z-8c8d999bf6df` is the separate pinned dirty-runtime closure: `QUARANTINED` and unpromoted because `json/tle/TLE.meta.json` is malformed. The private pointer is absent. The 12 checked-in data/pointer files remain strict last-known-good `ef98cfe`; tracked revision `sha256:7c1a20d93d1eb5faf7e2b964b13c7b4f0478f2eec95cc701ea1b1e57ef0d730c` has 70,474 total, 16,470 propagatable, 54,004 metadata-only, 12,490 current debris, and zero positioned debris. Do not conflate validation with promotion or quarantine, and do not rewrite the fallback merely to increase displayed debris.
- Keep capability discovery synchronized with server validation defaults and structured configuration limits. The browser must retain explicit Experimental/non-operational/Pc-unavailable wording and show partial coverage/unscreened interval counts.
- Do not persist browser bearer tokens. Use authorization headers for JSON and SSE, never URL/query tokens. Do not pass API/provider secrets to the screening subprocess.
- An adapter is not an admitted provider. Update `docs/governance/DATA_SOURCES.md` before using a new source, including license, access, retention, redistribution, integrity, cadence, and fallback.
- Browser startup or rendering changes require a nonblank-canvas check plus page-error, console-error, request-failure, and unintended-external-request inspection.
- Keep orbit class, object type, history scope, and tags as independent filter dimensions backed by one normalized result/count source. Activate position availability, reported RCS, owner/country, launch-year range, launch site, provider status, and designator/tag facets whenever `DEBRIS` is the sole object type and the orbit selection is nonempty; restoring facet share state must restore that parent state. Do not add a mass/weight filter or infer either from RCS/physical-size metadata. The UI label `HRO` maps to domain `HEO`; debris and rocket-body types must not rewrite orbit class. The fresh state begins at `MEO` without changing explicit shared state, and history is opt-in. A filter change that excludes the selected object clears selection, model/detail, and show-only state coherently. Full tracked discovery belongs to the visible virtualized results; keep the hidden compatibility selector limited to `None` plus the active NORAD. Keep matched, positioned, and position-unavailable coverage visible and truthful during loading/degraded states. Direct Globe/Mercator marker activation must use the same canonical selection path, and a hit-test miss must preserve selection. Metadata-only selection must never enable model, orbit, footprint, ground track, propagation, or screening actions. Red denotes authoritative debris type only, never risk, proximity, size, mass, or RCS.
- Keep Pages deployment artifact-only: verify a manually confirmed `master` commit and clean tree, build and validate its exact `dist/`, rehearse rollback in a disposable boundary, deploy only that artifact, and attest deployed bytes against `dist/asset-manifest.json`. GitHub environment protection and required reviewers are repository settings, not workflow guarantees. Never infer publication approval from passing automation.
- Do not add a second simulation accumulator or restore staggered sprite snapping. Materialize the fresh default MEO population first, but never expose a state proxy in the batched point layer at its construction/origin position or from an old epoch after filter re-admission: filter eligibility and current-epoch finite-position render readiness are separate. Keep one stable proxy per record and one Globe `THREE.Points` layer; do not restore individual rendered sprites/material clones. Catalog replacement and discontinuous time invalidate stale positions; selection, rate-direction, and job changes cancel superseded sampling while preserving usable in-window interpolation. Selected orientation, footprint, orbit, and detail consumers reuse the exact selected propagation state. Mercator reuses the shared motion pass, switches above 1,000 drawable records to the compact density path plus selected marker, caps track/redraw work, clears a stale track after failed rebuilding, and selected-orbit refresh updates existing geometry at bounded cadence rather than rebuilding every animation frame.
- Keep `obj/SSL_1300.glb` as the single canonical SSL 1300 model. Do not restore the removed byte-identical `obj/loral.glb` copy or another duplicate payload; model aliases belong in metadata/resolution logic, not duplicate assets.
- Keep dependency locks, vendored files, integrity metadata, license records, SBOM, and delivery documentation synchronized.
- Preserve unrelated worktree changes and do not delete user files merely because they are generated or untracked.
