## Mission

Graphina is a graph data science library for Rust.
It provides graph data structures and a wide range of ready-to-use algorithms for analyzing real-world networks, such as social, transportation, and
biological networks.
The goal is to be as feature-rich as NetworkX while keeping the speed and performance of Rust, and to offer a higher-level API than libraries like
petgraph and rustworkx.
A companion Python library, PyGraphina, exposes Graphina to Python through maturin.
Priorities, in order:

1. Correct, well-tested implementations of graph algorithms.
2. Clean, idiomatic Rust with safe abstractions and a high-level, ergonomic API.
3. Clear separation between the core library and the optional, feature-gated extensions.
4. Maintainable code with consistent error handling and documentation.

## Core Rules

- Use English for code, comments, docs, and tests.
- Never use `.unwrap()` or `.expect()` in non-test code (enforced by `make lint` via `clippy::unwrap_used` and `clippy::expect_used`). Production code
  should never panic.
- Algorithms return `Result<_, graphina::core::error::GraphinaError>`. Selector-style helpers that pick nodes (like `voterank`) may return plain
  collections.
- Top-level extension modules may depend only on `core`, never on each other (enforced by `make check-module-deps`).
- Gate every extension behind its feature flag with `#[cfg(feature = "...")]`. Enable only the required features to minimize size and compile time.
- Prefer small, focused changes over large refactoring.
- Add comments only when they clarify non-obvious behavior.
- Do not add features, error handling, or abstractions beyond what is needed for the current task.
- Add tests for every bug fix and new feature to prevent regression.
- Follow red-green TDD: write a failing test first, then the code to pass it (see Test-Driven Development).

Quick examples:

- Good: add a `local_reaching_centrality` function in `src/centrality/other.rs` that returns `Result<NodeMap<f64>, GraphinaError>`, gated behind
  `#[cfg(feature = "centrality")]`, with unit tests for the empty-graph and disconnected-graph cases.
- Good: add a property-based invariant to `tests/property_based_tests.rs` asserting that `connected_components` partitions every node into exactly one
  component.
- Bad: write `use crate::metrics::triangles;` inside `src/community/` to reuse a triangle count. Extensions may import only from `core`; move the
  shared helper into `core` or duplicate the small piece.
- Bad: call `.unwrap()` on a `Result` in non-test code because "the graph is obviously non-empty". Production code must never panic; return a
  `GraphinaError` instead.
- Bad: add a new algorithm without a feature gate, so it compiles into the `default = []` build.

## Writing Style

- Use Oxford commas in inline lists: "a, b, and c" not "a, b, c".
- Do not use em dashes. Restructure the sentence, or use a colon or semicolon instead.
- Avoid colorful adjectives and adverbs. Write "graph generator" not "powerful graph generator".
- Prefer using noun phrases for checklist items, not imperative verbs. Write "negative weight detection" not "detect negative weights".
- Headings in Markdown files must be in title case: "Build from Source" not "Build from source". Minor words
  (a, an, the, and, but, or, for, in, on, at, to, by, of, with, from) stay lowercase unless they are the first word.
- Write correct and complete sentences.
- Avoid made-up words, abbreviations, and colons in the middle of sentences.
- Don't use pretentious language and made-up words.

## Repository Layout

- `src/core/`: Always-enabled core library. Basic graph types, builders, IO, serialization, shortest paths, validation, and generators.
- `src/centrality/`, `src/community/`, `src/links/`, `src/metrics/`, `src/mst/`, `src/traversal/`, `src/approximation/`, `src/parallel/`,
  `src/subgraphs/`: Optional extensions, each behind a Cargo feature of the same name. The `all` feature enables them together.
- `src/lib.rs`: Crate root with module declarations, crate-level docs, and API conventions.
- `pygraphina/`: PyGraphina, the Python bindings crate built with maturin and published to PyPI as `pygraphina`. Contains its own `Cargo.toml`,
  `src/`, `tests/`, a `pygraphina/` type-stub package (`__init__.pyi` plus one `.pyi` per submodule, with `py.typed`), and docs.
- `benches/`: Criterion micro-benchmarks (`graph_benchmarks`, `algorithm_benchmarks`, `project_benchmarks`) that track Graphina's own performance over
  time, run by `make bench`.
- `comparisons/`: standalone comparison harnesses that measure Graphina against other libraries: `comparisons/graphina` (versus rustworkx-core) and
  `comparisons/pygraphina` (versus rustworkx and NetworkX), run by `make bench-graphina` and `make bench-pygraphina`.
- `tests/`: Workspace integration, end-to-end, regression, and property-based tests, plus `tests/testdata/` (downloaded via `make testdata`).
- `docs/`, `mkdocs.yml`: MkDocs documentation site.
- `Makefile`: GNU Make wrapper around `cargo`, maturin, and tooling commands.
- `rust-toolchain.toml`: Pinned Rust toolchain (1.85.0 as MSRV) with `rustfmt` and `clippy`.

## Architecture

The crate is split into a core library and a set of independent extensions.

- `core` is always compiled and contains everything the extensions build on: graph `Types` (directed and undirected, weighted and unweighted, with
  `NodeId`/`EdgeId` wrappers and `NodeMap`/`EdgeMap` aliases), `Builders`, `IO` (edge and adjacency lists), `Serialization` (JSON, binary, and
  GraphML), `Paths` (Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall, Johnson, A*, and IDA*), `Generators`, and `Validation`.
- Extensions are feature-gated modules outside `core` for higher-level tasks: centrality, community detection, link prediction, metrics, minimum
  spanning trees, traversal, approximation of NP-hard problems, parallel algorithms, and subgraph extraction.
- Graphina builds on `petgraph` for the underlying graph storage and uses `nalgebra`, `sprs`, and `rayon` for numerical and parallel work.

### Key Design Decisions

- Module independence: an extension module may import from `core` but not from another extension. This keeps features composable and is checked by
  `make check-module-deps`.
- Unified error handling: a single `GraphinaError` type and `Result` alias live in `core::error`, and algorithms return `Result` rather than
  panicking.
- Feature gating: each extension is optional. `default = []` enables only `core`; downstream users opt in to what they need, and `all` turns
  everything on for development and testing.
- Public re-exports and facades give consistent entry points (for example, the personalized PageRank vector and `NodeMap` facade APIs).
- PyGraphina is a thin binding layer over the core crate, built as a separate workspace member so the Rust library has no Python dependency.

### Dependency Boundaries

Graphina is a single crate, so the boundary is enforced by `make check-module-deps` (a `use crate::<module>` grep) rather than by the compiler. Keep
the dependency direction acyclic and hub-and-spoke:

0. `core` sits at the bottom. It depends on no other Graphina module.
1. Each extension (`approximation`, `centrality`, `community`, `links`, `metrics`, `mst`, `parallel`, `subgraphs`, `traversal`) may depend on `core`
   only.
2. No extension may depend on another extension, not through a `use crate::<other>` import and not through a fully-qualified `crate::<other>::` path.
   If two extensions need the same helper, move it into `core` or duplicate the small piece.
3. `parallel` is not exempt: a parallel algorithm reimplements over `core` rather than calling the sequential version in another extension.
4. PyGraphina depends on the Graphina crate, never the reverse. Keep Python concerns out of `core`.

### Encapsulation Rule

`core` re-exports its submodules with broad `pub mod`, so almost everything in `core` is technically reachable.
The deliberate public contract is narrower: the graph types and aliases (`BaseGraph`, `NodeId`,
`EdgeId`, `Graph`, `Digraph`, `NodeMap`, `EdgeMap`, `Directed`, `Undirected`), the `core::error` types (`GraphinaError`, `Result`), the builders, the
IO and serialization entry points, the path algorithms, the generators, and the validation helpers. Treat the rest as internal: the `pub(crate)` inner
fields of `NodeId` and `EdgeId`. Do not add a re-export "just for now" to reach an internal item from an extension; promote it to the contract
deliberately or keep it private.

### Cross-Cutting Invariants

- NodeId stability: `BaseGraph` wraps petgraph's `StableGraph`, so a `NodeId` stays valid across node removal and indices are never recycled.
  Algorithms may hold `NodeId`s across mutation.
- Subgraph extraction remaps: every `SubgraphOps` method that returns a new `BaseGraph` (`subgraph`, `induced_subgraph`, `ego_graph`,
  `component_subgraph`, `filter_nodes`, `filter_edges`) assigns fresh, sequential `NodeId`s in the returned graph. Do not assume a returned node
  matches its source `NodeId`.
- Return-type convention: algorithms return `Result<_, GraphinaError>`. Selector-style and partition-style helpers that cannot fail return plain
  collections instead: `voterank` (`Vec<NodeId>`), `connected_components`, `weakly_connected_components`, `strongly_connected_components` (
  `Vec<Vec<NodeId>>`), and `connected_components_map` (`NodeMap<usize>`). Some metrics return `Option` (`diameter`, `radius`, `average_path_length`
  return `None` for an empty or disconnected graph).
- Weight totality: the `mst` family (`kruskal_mst`, `prim_mst`, `boruvka_mst`) is generic over a totally-ordered weight `W: Ord`, so floating-point
  callers wrap weights in `ordered_float::OrderedFloat`. The `centrality` and `approximation` functions, by contrast, all accept a plain
  `f64`-weighted graph: the BFS-based ones (`betweenness_centrality`, `edge_betweenness_centrality`, `local_node_connectivity`) ignore weights, and
  the
  path-based ones (`harmonic_centrality`, `closeness_centrality`, `greedy_tsp`) order distances internally.
- Negative weights: `dijkstra` and `a_star` return an error on a negative weight; `bellman_ford`, `floyd_warshall`, and `johnson` accept negatives and
  return `None` on a negative cycle. Pathfinding assumes a non-empty graph; validate with `core::validation` first. A missing or removed
  source or target node yields a `node_not_found` error from the `Result`-returning algorithms; `bellman_ford`, which returns `Option`,
  reports every live node as unreachable instead.
- Fixed attribute types in IO and generators: `core::io` reads and writes graphs with `i32` node attributes and `f32` edge weights; `core::generators`
  produces `u32` node attributes and `f32` edge weights. Convert with `BaseGraph::convert` or `map_node_attrs`/`map_edge_weights` if you need other
  types.

## Component APIs

Signatures are self-describing; read them from the source rather than this file. This section pins only the non-obvious semantics, the return-type
choice, and the edge-case behavior a caller cannot infer from the type.
Every function listed is gated behind its module's feature flag.

### `core` (Always Compiled)

- `BaseGraph<A, W, Ty>` is the central type; `A` is the node attribute, `W` the edge weight, and `Ty` the `Directed` or `Undirected` marker.
  `Graph<A, W>` and `Digraph<A, W>` are the undirected and directed aliases. `degree`, `in_degree`, and `out_degree` return `Option<usize>` (`None`
  for a missing node); for undirected graphs in-degree and out-degree both equal the total degree. `density` returns `0.0` for fewer than two nodes.
  Graphs are simple: `add_edge` updates the weight of an existing edge instead of creating a parallel edge, and `add_edge_if_absent` inserts without
  overwriting an existing weight. `add_edge`, `add_edge_if_absent`, and `find_edge` check both directions on undirected graphs.
- `GraphinaError` (in `core::error`) is the single error type, with constructor helpers (`invalid_graph`, `node_not_found`, `no_path`,
  `convergence_failed`, and so on) and `From` impls for `io::Error`, `serde_json::Error`, and the bincode codec errors. `Result<T>` aliases
  `Result<T, GraphinaError>`.
- Builders: `AdvancedGraphBuilder` (with `DirectedGraphBuilder`/`UndirectedGraphBuilder` aliases) validates on `build`, rejecting out-of-bounds edge
  endpoints and, when configured, self-loops or parallel edges. `TopologyBuilder` has constructors (`complete`, `cycle`, `path`, `star`, `grid`) that
  return the graph directly and yield an empty graph rather than erroring on degenerate sizes.
- Serialization: `save_json`/`load_json`, `save_binary`/`load_binary`, and `save_graphml` round-trip through the index-based `SerializableGraph`. The
  `_strict` loaders (`load_json_strict`, `load_binary_strict` and `try_from_serializable`) additionally validate that the serialized directedness
  matches the target type; the plain loaders do not.
- Paths: `dijkstra`/`dijkstra_path_f64` (nonnegative weights, return `Result`), `bellman_ford` (negatives, returns `Option`, `None` on negative
  cycle), `a_star` (admissible heuristic, returns `Result<Option<(W, Vec<NodeId>)>>`), `floyd_warshall`, and `johnson` (all-pairs, return `Option`,
  `None` on negative cycle). Distance maps use `None` for unreachable nodes; the source has distance `Some(0)` (or `Some(0.0)`) and no predecessor.
- Generators: `erdos_renyi_graph`, `complete_graph`, `bipartite_graph`, `star_graph`, `cycle_graph` (requires `n >= 3`), `watts_strogatz_graph` (`k`
  even and `< n`), and `barabasi_albert_graph` (`n >= m`). Each takes a `seed` where randomized and returns `InvalidArgument` on out-of-range
  parameters.
- Validation: boolean predicates (`is_empty`, `is_connected`, `has_negative_weights`, `has_self_loops`, `is_dag`, `is_bipartite`, `count_components`)
  and the `require_*` and `validate_*` validator families that return a `Result<(), GraphinaError>` (for use as algorithm preconditions).

### `centrality`

Most functions return `Result<NodeMap<f64>>`. Iterative methods take explicit `max_iter` and `tolerance` and return `ConvergenceFailed` rather than
looping forever.

- `degree_centrality`, `in_degree_centrality`, `out_degree_centrality`: raw counts, not normalized. In undirected graphs, total degree, in-degree, and
  out-degree all count self-loops as 2. In directed graphs, a self-loop counts as 1 for in-degree and 1 for out-degree (summing to 2 for total
  degree). Succeed on an empty graph with an empty map.
- `betweenness_centrality` and `edge_betweenness_centrality`: take a `normalized: bool` and an `f64`-weighted graph; Brandes' algorithm over BFS, so
  edge weights are ignored; error on an empty graph. Edge betweenness stores both `(u, v)` and `(v, u)` for undirected graphs.
- `closeness_centrality`: Wasserman-Faust correction for disconnected graphs; a node with no reachable neighbors scores `0.0`.
- `eigenvector_centrality`: power iteration for both directed and undirected graphs; L2-normalizes the centrality vector each iteration (except for
  zero-edge/isolated graphs which yield a uniform `1/n` distribution).
- `pagerank`: takes `damping`, `max_iter`, `tolerance`, and optional `nstart`; result sums to `1.0`; dangling nodes redistribute uniformly; a single
  node scores `1.0`.
- `personalized_page_rank` takes `personalization: Option<Vec<f64>>`, `damping`, `tol`, and `max_iter`, returning a raw `Vec<f64>` aligned to internal
  node order. It is re-exported as `personalized_pagerank_vec`; `personalized_pagerank` is the `NodeMap` facade over it. Both require `damping` in
  `(0, 1)` and `max_iter > 0`.
- `katz_centrality`: takes `alpha`, an optional per-node `beta` closure, `max_iter`, and `tolerance`; returns `Result<NodeMap<f64>, GraphinaError>` to
  handle convergence issues.
- `voterank(graph, num_seeds) -> Vec<NodeId>`: selector-style, returns a plain vector, never a `Result`; stops early when no node has positive votes.
- `local_reaching_centrality`, `global_reaching_centrality`, `laplacian_centrality`: `Result<NodeMap<f64>>`.

### `community`

Detection functions return `Result<Vec<Vec<NodeId>>>` (communities) or `Result<Vec<usize>>` (per-node labels in internal node order); the
connected-component family returns plain collections.

- `louvain(graph, seed)`: modularity optimization with aggregation; nonnegative `f64` weights; a graph with no edges puts each node in its own
  community.
- `label_propagation(graph, max_iter, seed)` and `infomap(graph, max_iter, seed)`: return `Result<Vec<usize>>`; treat the graph as undirected; error
  on an empty graph or `max_iter == 0`. `label_propagation_map` and `infomap_map` are the `NodeMap<usize>` facades.
- `connected_components`, `weakly_connected_components`, `strongly_connected_components`: plain `Vec<Vec<NodeId>>` (no `Result`);
  `connected_components_map` returns `NodeMap<usize>`. SCC uses Tarjan; the undirected and weak variants coincide on undirected graphs.
- `girvan_newman(graph, target_communities)`: iterative edge-betweenness removal; expensive, not for large graphs; errors if it cannot reach
  `target_communities`.
- `spectral_embeddings(graph, k)` and `spectral_clustering(graph, k, seed)`: unnormalized Laplacian; require `0 < k <= n`; clustering applies k-means
  over the embedding.

### `links`

All link-prediction scorers take an optional `ebunch: Option<&[(NodeId, NodeId)]>` (defaulting to all unordered node pairs), operate on `f64`-weighted
graphs, treat pairs as undirected, and return a plain `Vec<((NodeId, NodeId), f64)>` (never a `Result`).

- `resource_allocation_index`, `adamic_adar_index`: sum over common neighbors; Adamic-Adar skips neighbors of degree `<= 1` (avoids `ln(1) = 0`). No
  common neighbors yields `0.0`.
- `jaccard_coefficient`: intersection over union of neighbor sets; `0.0` when the union is empty.
- `preferential_attachment`: `degree(u) * degree(v)`.
- `common_neighbor_centrality(graph, ebunch, alpha)`: `|N(u) ∩ N(v)|^alpha`.
- `common_neighbors(graph, u, v) -> usize`: plain count, not a scorer.
- Community-aware variants (`ra_index_soundarajan_hopcroft`, `cn_soundarajan_hopcroft`, `within_inter_cluster`) take a `community: Fn(NodeId) -> C`
  closure; `within_inter_cluster` also takes a `delta` smoothing constant that keeps the score finite when there are no inter-cluster neighbors.

### `metrics`

Distance metrics return `Option` (`None` for empty or disconnected); ratio metrics return plain `f64` (`0.0` on degenerate input). Weights are ignored
by the BFS-based metrics; only `assortativity` uses degree.

- `diameter`, `radius`, `average_path_length`: `Option<usize>`/`Option<f64>`; `None` if empty or disconnected; a single node gives `Some(0)`/
  `Some(0.0)`.
- `average_clustering_coefficient`, `transitivity`, `assortativity`: plain `f64` in a bounded range; `0.0` when undefined (no triangles, no triples,
  or a zero-variance degree sequence).
- `clustering_coefficient(graph, node) -> f64` and `triangles(graph, node) -> usize`: per-node; `0.0`/`0` for degree below 2.

### `mst`

`kruskal_mst`, `prim_mst`, and `boruvka_mst` each return `Result<(Vec<MstEdge<W>>, W)>` (edges plus total weight). They error only on an empty graph
and return a spanning forest (not an error) for a disconnected graph; a single node yields an empty edge set with zero weight. Weights need a total
order (use `OrderedFloat<f64>` for floats); `boruvka_mst` additionally requires `Send + Sync` and runs its cheapest-edge search in parallel.

### `traversal`

- `bfs(graph, start) -> Vec<NodeId>` and `dfs(graph, start) -> Vec<NodeId>`: visitation order; empty vector for a missing start node.
- `iddfs(graph, start, target, max_depth) -> Option<Vec<NodeId>>` and `bidis(graph, start, target) -> Option<Vec<NodeId>>`: return the path or `None`;
  `bidis` returns the unweighted shortest path. The `try_iddfs` and `try_bidirectional_search` variants return `Result<Vec<NodeId>>`, validating node
  existence (`node_not_found`) and distinguishing `no_path`.

### `approximation`

Heuristics for NP-hard problems. Set/value returning functions: `min_weighted_vertex_cover`, `maximum_independent_set`, `max_clique`,
`clique_removal` (returns `Vec<HashSet<NodeId>>`), `large_clique_size` (returns `usize`), `average_clustering` (returns `f64`),
`min_maximal_matching` (returns `HashSet<(NodeId, NodeId)>`), `ramsey_r2` (returns `(HashSet, HashSet)`), `densest_subgraph`, `treewidth_min_degree`/
`treewidth_min_fill_in` (return `(usize, Vec<NodeId>)`), and `local_node_connectivity` (returns `usize`) return collections or plain values with no
`Result` (except TSP).

- TSP: `greedy_tsp(graph, start)` is a greedy nearest-neighbor heuristic over `f64` weights. The returned tour is a cycle (`tour[0] == tour[last]`).
- `min_weighted_vertex_cover` is a greedy maximum-degree heuristic; edge weights are ignored, and the guarantee is logarithmic, not a
  constant factor.
- `local_node_connectivity` takes an `f64`-weighted graph and finds vertex-disjoint paths by BFS, so edge weights are ignored.

### `parallel`

Rayon-backed counterparts that mirror sequential algorithms over `core` and require `A: Sync` and `W: Sync`.
All return collections (`HashMap`/`Vec`), not `Result`, and produce results independent of thread count.

- `bfs_parallel(graph, starts)` and `shortest_paths_parallel(graph, sources)` run one search per source and return results in input order; shortest
  paths are unweighted (hop counts).
- `degrees_parallel`, `clustering_coefficients_parallel`, `triangles_parallel`, `connected_components_parallel` (and its `_list` variant;
  currently a sequential BFS kept for API parity, since component discovery is inherently ordered),
  `pagerank_parallel` (weight aware, matching the sequential `pagerank`; takes `nstart: Option<&HashMap<NodeId, f64>>`),
  `closeness_centrality_parallel`, and `all_pairs_shortest_path_length_parallel`
  return per-node maps or path results.

### `subgraphs`

The `SubgraphOps` trait is implemented for `BaseGraph`. Extraction methods that build a new graph (`subgraph`, `induced_subgraph`, `ego_graph`,
`component_subgraph`) return `Result` and remap `NodeId`s in the result; `filter_nodes` and `filter_edges` also remap but return the graph directly.
Query methods (`k_hop_neighbors`, `connected_component`) return `Vec<NodeId>` over the original ids, with `radius`/`k` of 0 returning just the start
node.

`make wheel-manylinux` (build wheels), and `make rundoc` (test Python doc examples). The Python toolchain uses `uv`.

## Test-Driven Development

Develop with the red-green-refactor cycle. Write the test before the implementation.

1. Red: write a test that captures the desired behavior, then run it (`make test`, or `cargo test` scoped to the module) and confirm it fails for the
   expected reason. A test that passes before any code is written is not exercising the new behavior.
2. Green: write the smallest amount of code that makes the test pass. Do not add behavior the failing test does not require.
3. Refactor: clean up the implementation and tests while keeping them green, then rerun `make lint` and `make test`.

Guidelines:

- One logical behavior per cycle. Add edge cases (empty graphs, disconnected components, self-loops, negative weights) as separate red-green steps
  rather than in a single large test.
- For bug fixes, write the regression test first as the red step: it must fail on the current code and pass after the fix. A regression test is a unit
  test that happens to pin a fixed bug, so it lives in the `#[cfg(test)]` module of the source file it exercises, next to that function's other unit
  tests. Only a regression that spans several algorithms or modules (a cross-cutting consistency check) belongs in `tests/regression_tests.rs`.
- Put the test where the behavior lives: `#[cfg(test)]` modules for logic that belongs to one function or module (including single-module bug
  regressions), `tests/` for user-facing and cross-module behavior, and `property_based_tests.rs` for algorithmic invariants.

## Testing Expectations

- Unit tests live in each module's source files using `#[cfg(test)]` modules. This includes regression tests for bugs whose fix lives in a single
  function or module: co-locate them with that module's other unit tests, not in `tests/`.
- Workspace-level tests live in `tests/`: `integration_tests.rs`, `e2e_tests.rs`, `regression_tests.rs`, and `property_based_tests.rs` (proptest).
  `regression_tests.rs` holds only cross-cutting regressions, such as consistency checks across several algorithms (for example, that Kruskal, Prim,
  and Boruvka agree, or that Dijkstra and Bellman-Ford agree).
- Some integration tests reference public datasets; run `make testdata` to fetch them first.
- Property-based tests cover algorithmic invariants; add cases when changing numerical behavior.
- Regression tests exist for fixed bugs; add one for every bug fix, co-located with the code it covers unless it is cross-cutting.
- No public API change is complete without a corresponding test.
- PyGraphina has its own tests under `pygraphina/tests/`, run with `make test-py`.

## Commit and PR Hygiene

- Keep commits scoped to one logical change.
- PR descriptions should include:
    1. Behavioral change summary.
    2. Tests added or updated.
    3. `make lint && make test` passes (yes/no).

Suggested PR checklist:

- [ ] Unit tests added or updated for logic changes
- [ ] Integration or regression test added for new user-facing behavior
- [ ] New algorithm gated behind the correct feature flag
- [ ] `make lint && make test` passes
- [ ] `make check-module-deps` passes
- [ ] Docs or README updated (if API surface changed)

## Review Guidelines (P0/P1 Focus)

Review output should be concise and include only critical issues. Do not include style-only feedback or broad praise.

- `P0`: must-fix defects (incorrect algorithm result, a panic path such as `.unwrap()`/`.expect()` in non-test code, a broken build, or a broken test
  workflow).
- `P1`: high-priority defects (a cross-module dependency that breaks `make check-module-deps`, a missing feature gate, an algorithm without `Result`
  -based error handling where it can fail, a numerical change with no property-based or regression test, or wrong empty/disconnected/self-loop
  handling).

Use this review format:

1. `Severity` (`P0`/`P1`)
2. `File:line`
3. `Issue`
4. `Why it matters`
5. `Minimal fix direction`
