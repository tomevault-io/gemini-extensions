# GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) Skill

**Version:** 1.2.0
**Purpose:** Transform AI markdown generation to be 100% markdownlint-compliant
**Target:** Zero markdownlint violations in all generated markdown

## Overview

This skill provides comprehensive guidance for generating GitHub Flavored
Markdown (GFM) that passes markdownlint validation without errors. Markdown
generated using this skill should be immediately usable in VSCode without
validation warnings. This skill is used whenever markdown is generated, unless
contrary instructions are given.

## Core Principles

### 1. Blank Lines Are Not Optional

**CRITICAL:** Blank lines around block elements are MANDATORY, not stylistic
choices.

Required blank lines:

- Before and after ALL lists (MD032)
- Before and after ALL headings (MD022)
- Before and after ALL code blocks (MD031)
- Between ALL block-level elements

### 2. Consistency Is Required

- Use ONE list marker style throughout (`-` recommended)
- Use ONE heading style throughout (ATX `#` recommended)
- Maintain consistent indentation
- Follow consistent patterns

### 3. Structure Matters

- Heading hierarchy must increment by one (1→2→3, not 1→3)
- Only ONE level 1 heading per document
- Headings must start at line beginning (no indentation)
- Files must end with exactly one newline

### 4. Invisible Characters Matter

**CRITICAL:** Invisible characters can break markdown parsing in ways that are
extremely difficult to debug.

Required character encoding:

- Use ONLY regular spaces (U+0020) for indentation, never tabs or non-breaking
  spaces
- Non-breaking spaces (U+00A0, `&nbsp;`) break markdown parsing
- Ensure proper character encoding (UTF-8)
- Watch for zero-width characters that can break parsing

## Pre-Generation Checklist

Before generating ANY markdown, mentally review:

- [ ] Where will lists appear? (Plan blank lines before/after)
- [ ] Where will headings appear? (Plan blank lines before/after)
- [ ] Where will code blocks appear? (Plan blank lines before/after)
- [ ] What heading levels are needed? (Verify progression)
- [ ] What list style will I use? (Stick to `-` throughout)
- [ ] Does the content need a language identifier for code? (Always specify)
- [ ] Am I showing markdown examples with code blocks? (Use four backticks)
- [ ] Are any lines too long? (Keep under 80 characters when possible)
- [ ] Will I need line breaks within paragraphs? (Use two trailing spaces)
- [ ] Will I use proper spacing? (Regular spaces only, no nbsp or tabs)
- [ ] Will tables be needed? (Use consistent column spacing style)

## Generation Rules

### Rule 1: Lists (MD032, MD004)

**ALWAYS:**

- Add blank line BEFORE list
- Add blank line AFTER list
- Use consistent markers (use `-` exclusively)
- Maintain proper indentation for nested items

**Template:**

```markdown
Preceding paragraph text.

- First item
- Second item
- Third item

Following paragraph text.
```

**NEVER:**

```markdown
Text before
- Item 1
- Item 2
Text after
```

### Rule 2: Headings (MD001, MD003, MD022, MD023)

**ALWAYS:**

- Add blank line BEFORE heading (except at document start)
- Add blank line AFTER heading
- Use ATX style (`#` prefix)
- Include space after `#`
- Start at line beginning (no indentation)
- Increment levels by one only

**Template:**

```markdown
Previous paragraph.

## Section Heading

Content following the heading.

### Subsection

More content here.
```

**NEVER:**

```markdown
Text
## Heading
Text

# Main
### Subsection (skipped level 2!)
```

### Rule 3: Code Blocks (MD031, MD040)

**ALWAYS:**

- Add blank line BEFORE code block
- Add blank line AFTER code block
- Specify language identifier
- Use ``` for fencing (not ~~~)
- Use more backticks for nested examples (see below)

**Template:**

````markdown
Here's an example:

```python
def hello():
    print("Hello, World!")
```

The code demonstrates...
````

**NEVER:**

````markdown
Here's an example:
```
code here
```
More text.
````

#### Nested Code Block Rule (CRITICAL)

When showing markdown examples that contain code blocks, use **one more
backtick** than the deepest nested level:

- **Three backticks (```)**: Regular code blocks
- **Four backticks (````)**: Showing markdown with code blocks
- **Five backticks (`````)**: Showing markdown showing markdown with code
  blocks

**Example - Wrong (causes MD040):**

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD031 MD040 -->

````markdown
```markdown
# Example Document

```bash
command here
```
```
````

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD031 MD040 -->

**Example - Right:**

`````markdown
````markdown
# Example Document

```bash
command here
```

````
`````

The parser needs the extra backtick to distinguish the outer fence from inner
fences.

### Rule 4: Line Length (MD013)

**ALWAYS:**

- Keep lines under 80 characters when possible
- Break long paragraphs at natural points
- Split long sentences across multiple lines
- Watch for long URLs and file paths

**When Line Length Matters:**

- Prose text and paragraphs
- Headings and titles
- List items
- Link text

**When Line Length Is Often Ignored:**

- Code blocks (usually excluded by default)
- URLs that cannot be shortened
- Tables with required width
- HTML tags and comments

**Breaking Long Lines:**

```markdown
Wrong (95 characters):
<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->
This is a very long line that exceeds the recommended 80 character limit and should be broken up.
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

Right (two lines under 80 chars):
This is a very long line that exceeds the recommended 80 character limit
and should be broken up.
```

**Handling Long URLs:**

```markdown
Option 1 - Reference style:
Check the [documentation][docs] for more details.

[docs]: https://very-long-url-that-would-exceed-line-length-limit.com/path/to/page

Option 2 - Angle brackets (auto-link):
<https://very-long-url.com/path>
```

**Note:** The default limit is 80 characters. Some projects configure this
differently (100, 120, or disabled). When generating markdown, assume 80
unless told otherwise.

### Rule 5: Inline Elements and Line Breaks

**Code spans:**

- No spaces inside: `code` not ` code `
- Use for short references only

**Emphasis:**

- **Bold:** Use `**text**` (no spaces inside)
- *Italic:* Use `*text*` (no spaces inside)
- ***Both:*** Use `***text***`

**Links:**

- Standard: `[text](url)`
- Auto: `<https://example.com>`
- Reference: `[text][ref]` with `[ref]: url` elsewhere
- URLs with underscores: Use angle brackets `<http://example.com/__word__/>`

**Line breaks with two trailing spaces:**

**IMPORTANT:** Use two trailing spaces to create line breaks (`<br>` tags)
within paragraphs or list items WITHOUT starting a new paragraph.

```markdown
First line of text  
Second line (line break but same paragraph)

New paragraph (blank line creates paragraph break)
```

This is the standard markdown way to create line breaks. It is NOT an error.

**Critical for AI:** When you see lines ending with two spaces in list items
(like checkboxes in success criteria sections), this is INTENTIONAL. These
spaces create line breaks so list items don't smash together. Do NOT remove
them. Example:

```markdown
- [x] First task completed  
- [x] Second task completed  
- [x] Third task completed  
```

Configure markdownlint MD009 with `br_spaces: 2` to accept this pattern.

### Rule 6: File Structure

**Document Start:**

```markdown
# Document Title

Introduction paragraph.

## First Section
```

No blank line needed before first heading, but blank line after is required.

**Document End:**

End files with exactly one newline character (MD047).

### Rule 7: Special Elements

**Horizontal Rules:**

Use consistent style (`---`, `***`, or `___`):

```markdown
Preceding text.

---

Following text.
```

**Blockquotes:**

```markdown
Regular text.

> Quote line 1
> Quote line 2

More regular text.
```

**Tables:**

```markdown
Previous paragraph.

| Header 1 | Header 2 |
|----------|----------|
| Cell 1   | Cell 2   |
| Cell 3   | Cell 4   |

Next paragraph.
```

**Task Lists:**

```markdown
Previous text.

- [ ] Incomplete task
- [x] Complete task
- [ ] Another task

Following text.
```

### Rule 8: Character Encoding and Spacing (Critical for AI Generation)

**ALWAYS:**

- Use regular ASCII spaces (U+0020, character code 32) for ALL indentation
- Never use non-breaking spaces (U+00A0, `&nbsp;`, character code 160)
- Never use tabs for indentation (use spaces)
- Use UTF-8 encoding without BOM
- Avoid zero-width characters (U+200B, U+200C, U+200D, U+FEFF)

**Common Sources of Invisible Characters:**

- **AI/LLM output** - May generate nbsp instead of regular spaces
- **Copy/paste from web** - Websites often use nbsp in rendered HTML
- **Word processors** - Documents may contain non-breaking spaces
- **HTML conversion** - `&nbsp;` entities may not convert properly

**How to Detect:**

In VS Code:

1. View → Render Whitespace (or press `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "View: Toggle Render
   Whitespace")
2. Regular spaces appear as small dots: `·`
3. Non-breaking spaces appear as a different symbol or may not show at all
4. Tabs appear as arrows: `→`

**How to Fix:**

Find and replace in VS Code:

1. Open Find/Replace (`Ctrl+H`)
2. Enable regex mode (click `.*` button)
3. Find: `\u00A0` (matches non-breaking spaces)
4. Replace: ` ` (regular space)
5. Click Replace All

Or use this regex to fix indentation in lists:

- Find: `^(\u00A0+)([-*+]|\d+\.)`
- Replace with proper spaces based on indent level

**Command-line detection:**

```bash
# Find lines with non-breaking spaces
grep -n $'\u00A0' filename.md

# Count non-breaking spaces
grep -o $'\u00A0' filename.md | wc -l

# Show hex dump to see character codes
od -c filename.md | grep -C2 '240'  # 240 octal = 160 decimal = U+00A0
```

**Template (Correct):**

```markdown
- List item with nested code:

    ```python
    # Four regular spaces before the fence
    code_here()
    ```

- Next item
```

Note: The four spaces before the fence are regular spaces (U+0020), not nbsp
(U+00A0).

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD032 MD031 MD040 -->

**NEVER:**

```markdown
- List item with nested code:

   ```
   // If these spaces are nbsp, the block won't nest properly!
   code_here()
   ```

- Next item will start a new list instead of continuing
```

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD032 MD031 MD040 -->

### Rule 9: Table Column Style (MD060)

**IMPORTANT:** Tables must use consistent column spacing throughout. MD060
enforces three recognized styles.

**Supported Styles:**

1. **Compact (RECOMMENDED):** Single space around cell content
2. **Aligned:** Pipe characters vertically aligned with padding
3. **Tight:** No spaces around cell content

#### Style: Compact (Default Recommendation)

Use exactly one space around cell content:

```markdown
| Header 1 | Header 2 |
| --- | --- |
| Short | Longer content |
| More | Data |
```

Note: The delimiter row uses `---` with single spaces around pipes.

#### Style: Aligned

Pipe characters align vertically with padded content:

```markdown
| Header 1 | Header 2       |
| -------- | -------------- |
| Short    | Longer content |
| More     | Data           |
```

#### Style: Tight

No spaces around content (minimal whitespace):

```markdown
|Header 1|Header 2|
|---|---|
|Short|Longer content|
|More|Data|
```

**Common Violations:**

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD060 -->

```markdown
Wrong - Inconsistent spacing (mixes compact and tight):
| Header 1| Header 2 |
| --- |---|
| Data|More data |
```

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD060 -->

**ALWAYS:**

- Choose ONE style for all tables in a document
- Apply spacing consistently to ALL rows (header, delimiter, data)
- Use compact style (`| cell |`) unless aligned tables are required
- Include spaces around content in compact style tables

**NEVER:**

- Mix spacing styles within a single table
- Mix spacing styles across tables in the same document
- Forget spaces in compact style (`|cell|` when using compact is wrong)
- Add inconsistent padding (`| cell |` vs `|cell |`)

**Configuration:**

Markdownlint MD060 accepts these style options:

- `any` (default) - Detects best-fit style, reports inconsistencies
- `compact` - Enforces `| cell |` style
- `aligned` - Enforces padded, vertically-aligned pipes
- `tight` - Enforces `|cell|` style

The `aligned_delimiter` parameter can require delimiter row alignment with
compact or tight styles.

## Critical Error Prevention

### Error Pattern 1: List Without Blank Lines

**Wrong:**

```markdown
Here are the items:
- Item 1
- Item 2
Let's continue.
```

**Right:**

```markdown
Here are the items:

- Item 1
- Item 2

Let's continue.
```

### Error Pattern 2: Heading Without Blank Lines

**Wrong:**

```markdown
Previous paragraph.
## Heading
Next paragraph.
```

**Right:**

```markdown
Previous paragraph.

## Heading

Next paragraph.
```

### Error Pattern 3: Code Block Without Blank Lines

**Wrong:**

````markdown
Here's the code:
```python
print("hello")
```
That's it.
````

**Right:**

````markdown
Here's the code:

```python
print("hello")
```

That's it.
````

### Error Pattern 4: Inconsistent List Markers

**Wrong:**

```markdown
- Item 1
* Item 2
+ Item 3
```

**Right:**

```markdown
- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3
```

### Error Pattern 5: Skipping Heading Levels

**Wrong:**

```markdown
# Main Title

### Subsection (skipped level 2!)
```

**Right:**

```markdown
# Main Title

## Section

### Subsection
```

### Error Pattern 6: Lines Too Long

**Wrong (106 characters):**

```markdown
<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->
This document demonstrates correct code block formatting with proper blank lines and language identifiers.
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->
```

**Right (79 characters):**

```markdown
This document demonstrates correct code block formatting with proper spacing.
```

**Or break into multiple lines:**

```markdown
This document demonstrates correct code block formatting with proper blank
lines and language identifiers.
```

### Error Pattern 7: Invisible Character Issues (Non-Breaking Spaces)

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD032 MD031 MD040 -->

**Wrong (using non-breaking space for indentation):**

Note: The following example uses nbsp (U+00A0) characters which are invisible:

```markdown
- List item

   ```
   code()
   ```

- Next item (will be renumbered as item 1!)
```

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD032 MD031 MD040 -->

**Right (using regular spaces):**

```markdown
- List item

    ```python
    code()
    ```

- Next item (continues properly)
```

**How This Manifests:**

- MD029: List numbering restarts or is inconsistent
- MD031: Code blocks reported as not having blank lines
- List items appear outside of list context in rendered output
- Nested code blocks don't maintain list numbering

**Prevention:**

1. Configure your editor to show all whitespace
2. After generating markdown, verify indentation uses regular spaces
3. Run find/replace to convert nbsp to regular spaces: `\u00A0` → ` `
4. Use a hex editor or "View > Show Invisible Characters" to diagnose

**This is especially critical for AI-generated markdown** as language models
may output non-breaking spaces in certain contexts.

## Language Identifiers for Code Blocks

Always specify the language. Common identifiers:

**Programming Languages:**

- `python`, `javascript`, `java`, `c`, `cpp`, `csharp`, `go`, `rust`
- `ruby`, `php`, `swift`, `kotlin`, `typescript`, `r`

**Shell/Command:**

- `bash`, `sh`, `powershell`, `cmd`, `zsh`

**Markup/Data:**

- `html`, `css`, `xml`, `json`, `yaml`, `toml`, `markdown`

**Database:**

- `sql`, `postgresql`, `mysql`, `mongodb`

**Other:**

- `text` (for plain text)
- `diff` (for diffs)
- `log` (for log files)

## Nesting and Complex Structures

### Lists with Code Blocks

Proper indentation maintains list context:

```markdown
1. First step

2. Second step with code:

    ```python
    def example():
        return True
    ```

3. Third step

Done.
```

### Lists with Multiple Paragraphs

Indent continuation paragraphs:

```markdown
- First item

- Second item with multiple paragraphs

  This is the continuation of the second item. It must be indented to maintain
  list context.

  Even more content in the second item.

- Third item

End.
```

### Nested Lists

Consistent indentation (2 or 4 spaces):

```markdown
- Parent item
  - Child item
  - Another child
    - Grandchild item
  - Back to child
- Another parent

Done.
```

## Post-Generation Validation

After generating markdown, verify:

1. **Lists:** Every list has blank lines before and after
2. **Headings:** Every heading has blank lines before and after (except
   document start)
3. **Code blocks:** Every code block has blank lines before and after
4. **Heading levels:** Progression is 1→2→3→4, no skipping
5. **List markers:** All use `-` consistently
6. **Code languages:** Every code block has a language identifier
7. **Nested fences:** Four backticks used for markdown examples with code
8. **Line length:** Lines under 80 characters (check long descriptions)
9. **File ending:** File ends with exactly one newline
10. **Line breaks:** Two trailing spaces used intentionally, not accidentally
11. **Character encoding:** Only regular spaces used for indentation (no nbsp,
    no tabs)
12. **Table style:** Tables use consistent column spacing (compact, aligned,
    or tight)

## Mental Model for Generation

Think of markdown as **blocks with mandatory spacing:**

```text
[Text Block]
↓ BLANK LINE ↓
[Heading Block]
↓ BLANK LINE ↓
[Text Block]
↓ BLANK LINE ↓
[List Block]
↓ BLANK LINE ↓
[Text Block]
↓ BLANK LINE ↓
[Code Block]
↓ BLANK LINE ↓
[Text Block]
[EOF + newline]
```

### Block Transition Rule

Every block transition = blank line required

## Quick Reference Card

### Every Time You Generate a List

```markdown
text

- item
- item

text
```

### Every Time You Generate a Heading

```markdown
text

## Heading

text
```

### Every Time You Generate Code

````markdown
text

```language
code
```

text
````

### Every Time You Show Markdown Examples with Code

Use four backticks (one more than the deepest nested level):

`````markdown
````markdown
# Example

```bash
command
```

````
`````

### Every Time You Nest Lists

```markdown
- parent
  - child (2 or 4 space indent)
  - child
- parent
```

### Every Time You Need a Line Break

```markdown
First line
Second line (note the two spaces after "First line")
```

### Every Time You Indent (Lists, Code Blocks)

Use regular spaces (U+0020), never:

- Non-breaking spaces (U+00A0, &nbsp;)
- Tabs
- Other invisible characters

### Every Time You Generate a Table

Use consistent spacing (compact style recommended):

```markdown
| Header | Header |
| --- | --- |
| Cell | Cell |
```

Key points:

- Single space after opening pipe: `| cell`
- Single space before closing pipe: `cell |`
- Consistent style for ALL rows

## Validation Command

Users will validate generated markdown with:

```bash
markdownlint filename.md
```

**Goal:** Zero errors, zero warnings.

## Common User Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Technical Documentation

Requirements:

- Clear heading hierarchy (1→2→3)
- Code blocks with languages
- Lists for steps/features
- Proper spacing throughout

### Scenario 2: README Files

Requirements:

- Single H1 (project title)
- Section headings (H2)
- Installation steps (lists + code)
- Examples (code blocks)

### Scenario 3: Guides and Tutorials

Requirements:

- Step-by-step lists
- Code examples
- Multi-paragraph list items
- Proper nesting

## Success Metrics

- **Zero** markdownlint violations
- **Zero** user corrections needed
- **100%** VSCode compatibility
- **Immediate** usability

## Advanced: Edge Cases and Cross-Platform Compatibility

### When to Consult Edge Case Documentation

For advanced users, developers, or when encountering unusual rendering issues,
consult the comprehensive edge case documentation:

**Resource:** `resources/MARKDOWN_VALIDATION_TRAPS.md`

This document covers:

- Platform-specific differences (GitHub vs VS Code vs CommonMark)
- Silent failure patterns that pass validation but render incorrectly
- Table limitations and workarounds
- Nested structure ambiguities
- Auto-linking issues and URL escaping
- Heading anchor generation across parsers
- HTML mixing complications
- Line ending considerations (CRLF vs LF)
- Invisible character traps (non-breaking spaces, zero-width chars)

### Quick Edge Case Reference

**Most common cross-platform issues:**

1. **URLs with underscores:** Use angle brackets
   `<http://example.com/__test__/>`
2. **Pipes in tables:** Use HTML entity `&#124;` instead of `|`
3. **Code blocks in lists:** Indent fences to match list content level
4. **Line endings:** Use LF only (configure Git: `core.autocrlf input`)
5. **Nested lists:** Use marker-relative indentation (2 spaces for `-`, 4 for
   `10.`)
6. **Link references:** Cannot interrupt paragraphs (need blank line before)
7. **Duplicate headings:** GitHub appends `-1`, `-2` to anchor IDs
8. **Complex table content:** Use HTML `<ul>` or `<pre>` tags instead
9. **Non-breaking spaces:** Use only regular spaces (U+0020) for indentation;
   nbsp (U+00A0) breaks list/code block nesting. Use `\u00A0` regex to
   find/replace

### Two-Space Line Break Standard

**This project explicitly uses two trailing spaces for line breaks.**

This is intentional markdown syntax, not trailing whitespace to be removed.

Example use cases:

- Line breaks within list items
- Poetry or formatted text
- Address blocks
- Any situation requiring `<br>` without new paragraph

Markdownlint MD009 should be configured with `br_spaces: 2` to recognize this
pattern as valid.

### Platform Testing Checklist

Before considering markdown "complete," test on:

- [ ] GitHub (primary target - create gist or draft PR)
- [ ] VS Code preview (secondary target)
- [ ] Markdownlint CLI (validation tool)
- [ ] Your target platform (if different from above)

**Test specifically:**

- [ ] Nested lists render correctly (3 levels)
- [ ] Code blocks in lists maintain list numbering
- [ ] Tables with complex content display properly
- [ ] All links work (including heading anchors)
- [ ] Line breaks appear where intended (two spaces)
- [ ] Long URLs don't break layout

### When GitHub Is Not Primary Target

If generating markdown for platforms other than GitHub:

- **VS Code only:** GFM works well, no special considerations
- **Jekyll/GitHub Pages:** Be aware of Kramdown differences
- **CommonMark strict:** Avoid GFM extensions (task lists, strikethrough)
- **General markdown:** Use safe subset (no tables, no task lists)

Consult `resources/MARKDOWN_VALIDATION_TRAPS.md` for platform-specific
guidance.

## Usage Instructions

1. Read this entire skill before generating markdown
2. Review the pre-generation checklist
3. Generate markdown with blank line awareness
4. Apply post-generation validation
5. Correct any violations immediately
6. For complex cases, consult edge case documentation

## Remember

**The most common violation is missing blank lines around lists, headings, and
code blocks. If you remember nothing else, remember: BLANK LINES ARE
MANDATORY.**

When in doubt:

1. Add blank lines before and after block elements
2. Use `-` for list markers
3. Use `#` for headings (ATX style)
4. Specify language for code blocks
5. Use four backticks when showing markdown with code blocks
6. Increment heading levels by one
7. Use two trailing spaces for intentional line breaks
8. Test on target platform (GitHub, VS Code, etc.)
9. Use regular spaces only (never nbsp or tabs)
10. Use consistent table spacing (`| cell |` for compact style)

Follow these rules, and your markdown will be perfect.
