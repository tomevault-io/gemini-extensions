## mem-skill

> Self-evolving memory and knowledge accumulation system for AI agents. Acts as a persistent 'second brain' that automatically retrieves past experiences, captures best practices, and proactively records successful solutions to a private knowledge base. Use this skill whenever starting any task, opening a new conversation, or triggering any other skill. Supports memory engines (default: built-in JSON/Markdown index; optional: QMD semantic search). Initialize with: /mem-skill init [--mem-engine=qmd].


# Mem-Skill: Self-Evolving Knowledge System

## Initialization

When the user runs `/mem-skill init`, execute the following setup:

1. Determine the current workspace root directory.
2. Create the directory structure:
   ```
   <workspace>/
   ├── knowledge-base/
   │   └── _index.json
   ├── experience/
   │   └── _index.json
   └── log.md
   ```
3. Populate `knowledge-base/_index.json` with the starter template (see "Knowledge Base Index Format" below).
4. Populate `experience/_index.json` with the starter template (see "Experience Index Format" below).
5. Create `log.md` with the starter template (see "Log Format" below).
6. Append to `log.md`: `## [YYYY-MM-DD] init | mem-skill initialized (engine: default)`
7. Confirm to the user: "mem-skill initialized. Knowledge base, experience, and log created."

### Engine Selection

When the user runs `/mem-skill init --mem-engine=qmd`, optionally with extra `--qmd-*` flags:

**Supported flags (all optional):**
| Flag | Values | Default |
|------|--------|---------|
| `--qmd-scope=<scope>` | `project`, `global` | _(ask user)_ |
| `--qmd-knowledge=<name>` | any string | _(ask user)_ |
| `--qmd-experience=<name>` | any string | _(ask user)_ |
| `--qmd-mask=<pattern>` | glob pattern | `**/*.md` |

**Examples:**
```
/mem-skill init --mem-engine=qmd
/mem-skill init --mem-engine=qmd --qmd-scope=project
/mem-skill init --mem-engine=qmd --qmd-scope=global --qmd-knowledge=my-kb --qmd-experience=my-exp
/mem-skill init --mem-engine=qmd --qmd-mask="**/*.md,**/*.txt"
```

**Init procedure:**

1. Perform all standard init steps above.
2. Check if QMD is installed: run `which qmd` or `npx @tobilu/qmd status`.
3. If QMD is **not** installed, prompt:
   > "QMD is not installed. Install it now with `npm install -g @tobilu/qmd`? (QMD requires Node.js >= 22)"
4. **Determine collection scope:**
   - If `--qmd-scope` was provided, use that value.
   - **Otherwise, you MUST ask the user** (do NOT guess or auto-choose):
     > "Where should QMD collections be stored?
     > 1. **Project** — scoped to this workspace (recommended for multi-project setups)
     > 2. **Global** — shared across all workspaces"
   - If **project**: default collection name prefix is the sanitized workspace folder name (e.g., folder `my-app` → prefix `my-app`).
   - If **global**: default collection name prefix is `mem`.
5. **Determine collection names:**
   - If `--qmd-knowledge` was provided, use that value.
   - If `--qmd-experience` was provided, use that value.
   - **For any name NOT provided via flags, you MUST ask the user** (do NOT auto-generate):
     > "What name for the knowledge collection? (default: `<prefix>-knowledge`)"
     > "What name for the experience collection? (default: `<prefix>-experience`)"
   - Accept user input or use the defaults if the user confirms.
6. **Determine file mask:**
   - If `--qmd-mask` was provided, use that value.
   - Otherwise use `**/*.md`.
7. After all values are confirmed, create the QMD collections:
   ```bash
   qmd collection add <workspace>/knowledge-base --name <knowledge-name> --mask "<mask>"
   qmd collection add <workspace>/experience --name <experience-name> --mask "<mask>"
   qmd context add qmd://<knowledge-name> "General knowledge base: reusable workflows, preferences, best practices"
   qmd context add qmd://<experience-name> "Skill-specific experience: pitfalls, parameters, solutions"
   qmd embed
   ```
8. Create a `.mem-skill.config.json` at the workspace root:
   ```json
   {
     "engine": "qmd",
     "version": "1.0.0",
     "scope": "<project|global>",
     "mask": "<mask>",
     "collections": {
       "knowledge": "<knowledge-name>",
       "experience": "<experience-name>"
     }
   }
   ```
9. Append to `log.md`: `## [YYYY-MM-DD] init | mem-skill initialized (engine: qmd, scope: <scope>, collections: <knowledge-name>, <experience-name>)`
10. Confirm: "mem-skill initialized with QMD memory engine. Collections created and embeddings generated."

**IMPORTANT:** Never silently create QMD collections without confirming scope and names with the user. If no `--qmd-*` flags were provided, every question above MUST be asked interactively.

For the **default engine** (no `--mem-engine` flag), create `.mem-skill.config.json` with:
```json
{
  "engine": "default",
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

For detailed engine-specific behavior, see [references/qmd-engine.md](references/qmd-engine.md) and [references/engines.md](references/engines.md).

## Upgrade Command

When the user runs `/mem-skill upgrade`, migrate an existing mem-skill workspace to the latest version. This is safe to run multiple times — it only adds what's missing.

**Procedure:**

1. **Check prerequisites:**
   - Verify `knowledge-base/_index.json` and `experience/_index.json` exist. If not, tell the user to run `/mem-skill init` instead.
   - Read `.mem-skill.config.json` to determine current engine and version.

2. **Create `log.md`** if it doesn't exist:
   ```markdown
   # mem-skill Activity Log

   Chronological record of all mem-skill operations. Each entry is parseable with `grep "^## \[" log.md`.

   ## [YYYY-MM-DD] upgrade | Migrated from v<old> to v1.2.0
   ```
   If `log.md` already exists, just append the upgrade log entry.

3. **Backfill `**Source:**` field** on existing entries:
   - Scan all `.md` files in `knowledge-base/` and `experience/`.
   - For each entry (identified by `## [Title]`) that is missing `**Source:**`, insert `**Source:** conversation` after the `**Date:**` line.
   - Report: "Backfilled Source field on <N> entries."

4. **Backfill `**Related:**` field** on existing entries:
   - For each entry missing `**Related:**`, insert an empty `**Related:**` line before `**Keywords:**`.
   - These will be populated naturally by future writes and by running `/mem-skill lint`.
   - Report: "Added Related field placeholder to <N> entries."

5. **Update `.mem-skill.config.json` version** to `1.2.0`.

6. **QMD engine post-upgrade** (if engine is `qmd`):
   - Run `qmd update && qmd embed` to re-index the backfilled entries.

7. **Confirm:**
   > "Upgrade complete (v<old> → v1.2.0):
   > - Created log.md ✓ (or: log.md already existed)
   > - Backfilled Source on <N> entries ✓
   > - Added Related placeholder to <N> entries ✓
   > - Updated config version ✓
   >
   > Run `/mem-skill lint` to discover cross-reference opportunities between your existing entries."

## Manual Recording Command

When the user runs `/mem-skill recordnow`, immediately trigger the recording flow for the **current conversation** — even if Step 5 was not triggered automatically.

This is useful when:
- Multiple tasks were completed in one session and the agent forgot to ask.
- The user wants to record something that didn't trigger the satisfaction keywords.
- The user remembers later that a solution was worth saving.

**Procedure:**
1. Review the full conversation history for completed tasks.
2. For **each completed task**, summarize it into a one-line essence.
3. Evaluate: "Will this save time next time?"
4. Present all recordable items to the user as a numbered list:
   > "I found these completed tasks worth recording:
   > 1. [summary of task 1] → knowledge-base
   > 2. [summary of task 2] → knowledge-base
   > 3. [summary of skill usage] → experience
   >
   > Which ones should I record? (all / 1,2 / none)"
5. On approval, write each selected item following the same write procedure as Step 5 (including compounding checks, cross-references, source fields, and QMD post-write sync if applicable).
6. Append to `log.md`: `## [YYYY-MM-DD] recordnow | Manually recorded <N> entries`
7. If no recordable tasks are found, respond: "I reviewed the conversation but didn't find any completed tasks worth recording. Is there something specific you'd like me to save?"

## Health-Check Command

When the user runs `/mem-skill lint`, perform a comprehensive health-check of the knowledge base and experience store.

**Checks performed:**

1. **Duplicate detection** — Scan all entries for similar titles, overlapping keywords (>= 70% overlap), or near-identical content. Flag entries that should be merged.

2. **Stale entries** — Flag entries older than 6 months (based on `**Date:**` field) that have no `**Updated:**` timestamp. These may contain outdated practices.

3. **Contradiction detection** — Within the same category, look for entries that give conflicting advice on the same topic. Flag with both entries quoted.

4. **Orphan detection**:
   - Categories in `_index.json` with no corresponding `.md` file.
   - `.md` files in `knowledge-base/` or `experience/` with no `_index.json` entry.
   - Broken `**Related:**` links pointing to non-existent entries.

5. **Missing cross-references** — Entries in the same category or with overlapping keywords that have no `**Related:**` links between them.

6. **Knowledge gaps** — Categories with fewer than 2 entries. Suggest whether to merge into a broader category or to actively build out.

7. **Index consistency** — Verify `totalEntries` and per-category `count` values match the actual entry count in each `.md` file.

**Output format:**
```
mem-skill Health Check — YYYY-MM-DD
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✓ 24 entries across 5 categories
✓ 8 experience entries across 3 skills

⚠ STALE (2):
  - knowledge-base/frontend-dev.md#"React Class Components" (2025-08-12, 8 months old)
  - experience/skill-webpack.md#"Loader Order Fix" (2025-06-03, 10 months old)

⚠ DUPLICATE (1 pair):
  - knowledge-base/workflow.md#"CI Pipeline Setup" ↔ knowledge-base/backend-dev.md#"CI/CD Best Practices"
    → Keywords overlap 75%. Consider merging.

⚠ MISSING CROSS-REFS (3):
  - knowledge-base/frontend-dev.md#"Responsive Grid" ↔ knowledge-base/design-layout.md#"CSS Grid Patterns"
  - ...

✓ No contradictions detected
✓ No orphans detected
✓ Index counts consistent

Summary: 6 issues found (0 critical, 6 warnings)
```

**After lint:**
- Ask the user which issues to fix.
- For merges: combine entries, update cross-references, update index counts.
- For stale entries: ask whether to update, archive, or delete.
- For missing cross-references: add `**Related:**` links.
- Append to `log.md`: `## [YYYY-MM-DD] lint | Health-check completed: <N> issues found`

**QMD engine:** After any fixes that modify `.md` files, run `qmd update && qmd embed`.

## Ingest Command

When the user runs `/mem-skill ingest <source>`, process an external source into knowledge base entries.

**Source types:**
| Source | Example |
|--------|---------|
| Local file | `/mem-skill ingest ./docs/api-guide.md` |
| URL | `/mem-skill ingest https://example.com/best-practices` |
| Directory | `/mem-skill ingest ./docs/` (processes all markdown files) |

**Procedure:**

1. **Read the source:**
   - Local file: Read the file contents.
   - URL: Fetch the webpage and extract main content.
   - Directory: List all `.md` files and process each.

2. **Extract key knowledge points:**
   - Identify 3-10 distinct, reusable insights from the source.
   - Each insight should pass the recording criteria: "Will this save time next time?"
   - Discard pure theory, one-off context, and non-actionable content.

3. **Match against existing categories:**
   - For each extracted insight, find the best matching category in `knowledge-base/_index.json`.
   - If no category matches, follow the Dynamic Category flow.

4. **Check for compounding opportunities:**
   - For each insight, search existing entries for related content (same as Step 5, step 3).
   - If a related entry exists, offer to update/merge rather than duplicate.

5. **Present to the user:**
   > "I extracted these knowledge points from [source]:
   > 1. [insight 1] → knowledge-base/<category1>.md (new)
   > 2. [insight 2] → knowledge-base/<category2>.md (update existing: '<entry-title>')
   > 3. [insight 3] → knowledge-base/<category3>.md (new)
   >
   > Which ones should I record? (all / 1,3 / none)"

6. **Write on approval:**
   - Create new entries or update existing ones.
   - Set `**Source:**` to `file:<path>` or `url:<link>`.
   - Add `**Related:**` cross-references between related entries.
   - Update `_index.json` counts and timestamps.

7. **Log**: Append to `log.md`: `## [YYYY-MM-DD] ingest | Processed <source> → <N> entries created/updated`

8. **QMD engine post-write:** Run `qmd update && qmd embed`.

**IMPORTANT:** Ingest does NOT blindly copy source content. It extracts actionable knowledge that fits the recording criteria, re-formats it into the standard entry format, and integrates it with existing knowledge.

## Core Loop (Mandatory Every Turn)

Execute these steps on every conversation turn. Do not display internal cache state to the user.

### Step 0: In-Conversation Cache (Internal)

Maintain these variables silently within the conversation:
- `last_keywords` — keywords from the previous turn
- `last_topic_fingerprint` — top 3 keywords as a fingerprint
- `last_index_lastUpdated` — timestamp of last index read
- `last_matched_categories` — categories matched on last read
- `last_used_skills` — non-mem-skill skills used this turn
- `missing_experience_skills` — skills with no experience entry
- `loaded_experience_skills` — skills whose experience has been loaded this session

### Step 1: Extract Keywords (No File I/O)

- Extract 3–8 core nouns/phrases from the user's current message.
- Deduplicate and normalize casing.
- Generate `topic_fingerprint` from the top 3 keywords.

### Step 2: Detect Topic Switch (No File I/O)

A topic switch occurs when any of these conditions are met:
- Explicit transition words: "also", "switch to", "by the way", "next", "instead"
- Current keywords differ from `last_keywords` by >= 40%
- User explicitly requests a new category or topic

### Step 3: Cross-Skill Experience Read (Forced — Ignores Topic Switch)

Whenever a non-mem-skill skill is used this turn:
- If the `skill-id` is already in `loaded_experience_skills`, skip (do not re-read or re-announce).
- Otherwise:
  1. Read `experience/_index.json`.
  2. If a matching `skill-id` entry exists, load `experience/skill-<skill-id>.md`.
  3. Add the `skill-id` to `loaded_experience_skills`.
  4. Include in response: `"Loaded experience: skill-<skill-id>.md"`
  5. Log (first read per session only): Append to `log.md`: `## [YYYY-MM-DD] read | Retrieved experience: skill-<skill-id>.md`
  6. If no entry exists, add to `missing_experience_skills`.

**Engine-specific retrieval:**
- **Default engine**: Read `experience/_index.json` and match by `skillId`.
- **QMD engine**: Read collection names from `.mem-skill.config.json`, then run `qmd search "<skill-id>" -c <experience-collection> --json -n 5` for keyword match, or `qmd query "<skill-id> <context>" -c <experience-collection> --json -n 5` for deeper retrieval.

### Step 4: Knowledge Base Read (Only on Topic Switch)

Execute only on the first turn of the conversation or when a topic switch is detected:

**Default engine:**
1. Read `knowledge-base/_index.json`.
2. Match current keywords against all category `keywords` arrays.
3. Load every matched category file (no priority ranking — load all matches).
4. If no category matches, follow the "Dynamic Category" flow (see below).
5. If any files were loaded, include in response: `"Loaded knowledge: <file1>.md, <file2>.md"`
6. Log (first read per session only): Append to `log.md`: `## [YYYY-MM-DD] read | Loaded knowledge: <file1>.md, <file2>.md`

If no topic switch occurred, reuse `last_matched_categories` without re-reading.

**QMD engine:**
1. Read collection names from `.mem-skill.config.json`.
2. Run `qmd query "<keywords joined by space>" -c <knowledge-collection> --json -n 10 --min-score 0.3`.
3. Load top results as context.
4. Include in response: `"Retrieved knowledge via QMD: <titles>"`

### Step 5: Proactive Recording (Most Important)

**Trigger conditions:**
- The current task is clearly completed at high quality.
- The user expresses satisfaction ("great", "perfect", "that works", etc.).
- The agent synthesizes a particularly valuable answer (comparison, deep analysis, connection discovery) that would be useful beyond this conversation.

**Recording procedure:**
1. **Summarize**: Distill the solution into a one-line essence.
2. **Evaluate value**: "Will this save time next time?"
3. **Check for existing related entries** (compounding update):
   - Search `knowledge-base/_index.json` and relevant `.md` files for entries with overlapping keywords or similar topics.
   - **QMD engine**: Run `qmd query "<summary>" -c <knowledge-collection> --json -n 3 --min-score 0.5` to find related entries.
   - If a closely related entry exists, offer to **update/merge** instead of creating a duplicate:
     > "I found an existing entry '[[<category>#<existing-title>]]' that's related. Should I update it with the new information, or create a separate entry?"
   - **Update** = append new points to the existing entry, add `**Updated:** YYYY-MM-DD` below the original date, and add cross-references.
   - **Separate** = create a new entry with `**Related:**` links to the existing one (and update the existing entry's `**Related:**` too).
4. **Ask permission**: Always say something like:
   > "We solved [problem description]. I'd like to record this experience so I can reference it next time. Is that okay?"
5. **Write on approval**:
   - **Skill experience** (if a non-mem-skill skill was used and the skill has no entry or has new techniques): Write to `experience/skill-<skill-id>.md` and update `experience/_index.json`.
   - **General knowledge** (if it's a reusable workflow, preference, or solution): Write to `knowledge-base/<category>.md` and update `knowledge-base/_index.json`.
   - Include `**Source:**` field (default: `conversation`).
   - Include `**Related:**` cross-references to any related entries found in step 3.
6. **Log the operation**: Append to `log.md`:
   - For new entries: `## [YYYY-MM-DD] write | Recorded to <path>: "<title>"`
   - For updates: `## [YYYY-MM-DD] update | Updated <path>: "<title>" (merged new info)`

**Filing valuable answers back:**
If the agent produces a valuable synthesis (comparison table, analysis, architectural decision) during a query — not just task completion — proactively offer:
> "This [comparison/analysis/summary] seems valuable beyond this conversation. Want me to save it to the knowledge base?"

This ensures knowledge is captured from exploration and research, not just from building things.

**QMD engine post-write:**
After writing any `.md` file, run:
```bash
qmd update
qmd embed
```

**Forced rule — always ask when experience is missing:**
If a non-mem-skill skill was used this turn and that skill has no entry in `experience/_index.json`, you **must** ask at task completion:
> "We used <skill-name> this time, but there's no experience record yet. Can I record this session's approach for future reference?"

**If Step 5 was not triggered** (e.g., multi-task sessions where satisfaction signals were missed), the user can run `/mem-skill recordnow` at any time to manually trigger recording. See "Manual Recording Command" above.

## Index Formats

### Knowledge Base Index Format

`knowledge-base/_index.json`:
```json
{
  "lastUpdated": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "totalEntries": 0,
  "categories": [
    {
      "id": "category-id",
      "name": "Category Name",
      "keywords": ["keyword1", "keyword2"],
      "file": "category-id.md",
      "count": 0
    }
  ]
}
```

### Experience Index Format

`experience/_index.json`:
```json
{
  "lastUpdated": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "skills": [
    {
      "skillId": "skill-id",
      "file": "skill-<skill-id>.md",
      "keywords": ["keyword1", "keyword2"],
      "count": 0
    }
  ]
}
```

### Log Format

`log.md`:
```markdown
# mem-skill Activity Log

Chronological record of all mem-skill operations. Each entry is parseable with `grep "^## \[" log.md`.

## [YYYY-MM-DD] init | mem-skill initialized (engine: <engine>)
## [YYYY-MM-DD] read | Loaded knowledge: <file1>.md, <file2>.md
## [YYYY-MM-DD] read | Retrieved experience: skill-<id>.md
## [YYYY-MM-DD] write | Recorded to knowledge-base/<category>.md: "<entry-title>"
## [YYYY-MM-DD] write | Recorded to experience/skill-<id>.md: "<entry-title>"
## [YYYY-MM-DD] update | Updated knowledge-base/<category>.md: "<entry-title>" (merged new info)
## [YYYY-MM-DD] lint | Health-check completed: <N> issues found
## [YYYY-MM-DD] ingest | Processed <source> → <N> entries created/updated
## [YYYY-MM-DD] recordnow | Manually recorded <N> entries
```

**Logging rules:**
- Append to `log.md` on every write, update, lint, ingest, and recordnow operation.
- Read operations: log only on first read per session (not every turn).
- Keep entries on a single line for parseability.
- Do NOT log keyword extraction or topic detection (internal-only).

## Entry Formats

### Knowledge Base Entry

```markdown
## [Short Title]
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Source:** conversation | file:<path> | url:<link>
**Context:** One-line description of the use case
**Best Practice:**
- Key point 1
- Key point 2 — parameter notes and tuning guidance
**Related:** [[<category>#<entry-title>]], [[<category2>#<entry-title2>]]
**Keywords:** keyword1, keyword2, keyword3
```

### Experience Entry

```markdown
## [Problem/Technique Title]
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Skill:** <skill-id>
**Source:** conversation | file:<path> | url:<link>
**Context:** One-line description of the issue
**Solution:**
- Concrete step 1
- Concrete step 2
**Key Files/Paths:**
- /path/to/relevant/file
**Related:** [[skill-<other-id>#<entry-title>]], [[<kb-category>#<entry-title>]]
**Keywords:** keyword1, keyword2, keyword3
```

### Source Field Values

| Value | When to Use |
|-------|-------------|
| `conversation` | Learned from a chat session (default) |
| `file:<path>` | Ingested from a local file |
| `url:<link>` | Ingested from a web URL |

### Related Field

Cross-references use `[[file#heading]]` format (compatible with Obsidian-style wikilinks):
- Link to knowledge entries: `[[<category>#<entry-title>]]`
- Link to experience entries: `[[skill-<id>#<entry-title>]]`
- When writing a new entry, search existing entries for related content and add bidirectional links (update the related entry's `**Related:**` field too).

## Dynamic Category (Knowledge Base Only)

When user keywords do not match any existing category:
1. Suggest creating a new category.
2. Ask the user for a category name and keywords.
3. Create a new `<category-id>.md` file and update `knowledge-base/_index.json`.

## Recording Criteria

**Core question: Will this save the user time next time?**

### Knowledge Base — Should Record:
- Reusable workflows and decision steps (cross-domain procedures)
- High-cost mistakes and their correction paths
- Critical parameters, settings, or prerequisites
- User preferences and style rules (tone, format, design)
- Multi-attempt solutions (include failure reasons and success conditions)
- Reusable templates, checklists, and output formats
- External dependencies or resource locations

### Knowledge Base — Should NOT Record:
- Single Q&A with no reusable process
- Pure conceptual explanations without concrete steps
- Context-free, non-reusable conclusions

### Experience — Should Record:
- Pitfalls and their fixes when using a specific skill (include error messages)
- Critical parameters or configurations that affect outcomes
- Reusable templates, prompts, or workflows for that skill
- Dependency or asset paths (fonts, images, project entry points)
- Steps requiring a specific order or technique to succeed

### Experience — Should NOT Record:
- Pure theory or conceptual explanations (those belong in knowledge-base)
- Conclusions without reproducible steps
- One-off, non-reusable operations

## Storage Paths

- Knowledge index: `knowledge-base/_index.json`
- Knowledge content: `knowledge-base/<category-id>.md`
- Experience index: `experience/_index.json`
- Experience content: `experience/skill-<skill-id>.md`
- Config: `.mem-skill.config.json`

## QMD Upgrade Suggestion

When the knowledge base exceeds 50 entries, proactively suggest upgrading to QMD:
> "Your knowledge base has grown to [N] entries. For faster semantic search, consider upgrading to QMD: run `/mem-skill init --mem-engine=qmd`."

For full QMD engine details, see [references/qmd-engine.md](references/qmd-engine.md).
For the engine abstraction and adding new engines, see [references/engines.md](references/engines.md).
