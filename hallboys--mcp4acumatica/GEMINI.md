### Storage Abstraction (Platform Portability)

Tool handlers, the Acumatica HTTP client, config, and caching are decoupled from Cloudflare via two abstractions:

- **`IKeyValueStore`** (`src/lib/kv-store.ts`) — Platform-agnostic interface for key-value storage (get, put, delete, list). Cloudflare Workers uses `CloudflareKVStore` which wraps `KVNamespace`.
- **`AppEnv`** (`src/types/acumatica.ts`) — Portable environment type containing Acumatica connection settings and a `store: IKeyValueStore`. All tool handlers and shared libraries use `AppEnv`. The Cloudflare-specific `Env` extends `AppEnv` with CF bindings (`TOKEN_STORE`, `OAUTH_KV`, `MCP_OBJECT`, etc.).

This design allows future self-hosted adapters (Node.js + Redis/SQLite) to reuse all tool handlers without modification. See `docs/self-hosting-guide.md`.

## OAuth Flow

Claude → Worker `/authorize` → Acumatica login (with `openid profile email api offline_access` scopes) → Worker `/callback` → OIDC userinfo → canary GI role check → `/consent` interstitial → token stored → MCP session active.

Acumatica is the sole identity provider. Users log in with their Acumatica credentials (or via whatever SSO their Acumatica instance is configured with). The MCP server does not manage identity separately — it delegates entirely to Acumatica.

### Access Control & Governance

1. **Role gate (canary GI):** After login, the callback queries the `MCPAccess` Generic Inquiry via OData. This GI is assigned only to the `MCP Access` role in Acumatica. If the OData query returns 200, the user has the role; if 403, they don't. This avoids exposing user/role data — the GI content is irrelevant, it's purely an access gate. Users without the role see a 403 page directing them to contact their Acumatica admin. The role name is configurable via `ACUMATICA_MCP_ROLE` env var.

2. **Consent interstitial:** Users who pass the role check see a consent page explaining that data will be processed by AI, access is logged, and sensitive fields are redacted. They must acknowledge before the MCP session activates.

3. **Sensitive field redaction:** Tool responses are automatically scanned for sensitive field names (SSN, bank accounts, salary, credit card, etc.) using pattern matching. Matched values are replaced with `[REDACTED]`. Patterns are configurable via `REDACT_PATTERNS` (add) and `REDACT_SKIP` (whitelist) env vars. See `src/lib/redact.ts`.

4. **Enhanced audit logging:** All tool invocations include the Acumatica username, tool parameters (what was queried), duration, and success/error status. Auth events (login success, access denied, consent accepted) are logged separately in the Worker handler. Tool invocation and field redaction logs are written directly to R2 from the Durable Object (Cloudflare Logpush only captures Worker-level traces, not DO traces). The `writeLogsToR2()` function in `src/lib/logger.ts` writes NDJSON entries to `do-logs/{date}/{timestamp}-{random}.ndjson` keys in R2 and returns a boolean success flag. To minimize R2 file count, the DO buffers log entries (`logBuffer` in `AcumaticaMcpServer`) and flushes them when the buffer reaches 25 entries OR a DO alarm fires 15 seconds after the last buffered entry. The buffer is mirrored to persistent DO storage (`ctx.storage` key `log_buffer`) on every append, because the alarm handler runs on a **fresh DO instance** after eviction — in-memory state is gone by then. `flushLogs()` calls `hydrateBuffer()` first so the alarm path reads the persisted entries from storage before writing to R2. Without this, short sessions (<25 entries) would be dropped whenever the DO was evicted between the tool call and the alarm firing. Flushes are serialized via a `flushing` mutex so the threshold path and alarm path cannot race over the buffer. If an R2 put fails, `flushLogs()` re-enqueues the snapshot at the head of the buffer, re-persists it, and schedules a retry alarm (30 s); previously a failed put silently dropped the batch. Alarms are registered via `this.ctx.storage.setAlarm(...)` and handled in the class's `alarm()` method, which Cloudflare wakes the DO specifically to run even if it has gone idle. Console.log is preserved for `wrangler tail` live debugging. The admin console at `/docs/admin` reads both Logpush-written and DO-written logs from R2 using streaming server-side pagination (prefix-scoped R2 listing, parallel batched reads, incremental filtering, early-exit once one page of results is collected) to keep load times fast even for multi-day queries.

5. **Pagination refusal semantics:** The list/query tools (`acumatica_list_entities`, `acumatica_run_inquiry`, `acumatica_list_generic_inquiries`) hard-cap results at `ACUMATICA_MAX_RECORDS` (default 1000, runtime-overridable via the admin console → KV `config:acumatica_max_records`). When a response hits the cap, the tool returns a structured envelope `{ results, truncated: true, mayBeComplete: true, paginationSupported: false, actionRequired: "..." }` instructing the model to stop calling and ask the user to refine `filterExpression`/`titleFilter`. The envelope explicitly states that the result *may* be complete — Acumatica's contract API and OData GI endpoints don't report a total count, so a response exactly at the cap is indistinguishable from a larger underlying result set. No server-side cooldown — the semantic response is the mechanism. The numeric cap is validated at write time by the admin console (positive integer, ≤ 10 000) via `validateConfigValue()` in `src/lib/config.ts`; downstream readers additionally use `parsePositiveIntConfig()` to defend against bad env-var values.

6. **Rate limiting.** `withRateLimit()` (`src/lib/rate-limiter.ts`) enforces two caps keyed by Acumatica username: in-isolate concurrency (max 3 active) and a per-minute KV-backed bucket (`ratelimit:{username}:{minute}`, TTL 120 s, max 40). Keying per-user prevents users on the same isolate from contaminating each other's limits; the KV bucket survives DO/isolate recycling so a client cannot bypass the per-minute cap by reconnecting. Active slots are tracked as `{id → startedAt}` rather than a bare counter; any slot older than 60 s is pruned as leaked, so an uncaught rejection or frozen isolate can't permanently eat a user's concurrency quota.

7. **Admin login throttling.** The admin console at `/docs/admin/login` is throttled per client IP via `admin_login_fail:{ip}` counters (KV, 15-minute window, 5 attempts). Further attempts 429 until the window expires; successful login clears the counter. All failures are padded to ≥ 1 s so the throttle path is indistinguishable from a slow mismatch. Client IP is sourced from `CF-Connecting-IP` with `X-Forwarded-For` fallback.

8. **Per-user token serialization (TokenManager DO).** IdentityServer rotates the refresh token on every use, so concurrent refreshes of the same user's token race: the loser POSTs an already-rotated token, gets a `4xx`, and (as of 0.32.0) had its MCP grant spuriously revoked — a "session dead" on an otherwise-healthy account, the cause of *frequent* disconnects. The original in-isolate `inflightLookups` map only de-duplicated refreshes *within one isolate*; Claude.ai runs multiple concurrent sessions, each its **own** session DO/isolate, so the race persisted across them. Fixed (0.33.0) by routing all token access through a per-user **`TokenManager` Durable Object** (`src/token-manager.ts`, bound as `TOKEN_MANAGER`, keyed by `idFromName(acumaticaUsername)`). There is exactly one instance per user *globally*, so every token request across all of a user's sessions funnels through it and an in-DO inflight promise coalesces them into a single refresh — the cross-isolate race is now structurally impossible. The DO's own (strongly-consistent) storage is the authoritative token copy; KV (`user_token:{username}`) is a write-through backup and the adoption source for users who authed before the DO existed. `/callback` seeds the DO via `setToken()` so there's no KV eventual-consistency window right after re-auth. `getAcumaticaTokenForUser()` (`src/auth/acumatica-oauth.ts`) is now a thin shim over `env.tokenProvider.getAccessToken()`, mapping the DO's discriminated `TokenResult` (`ok`/`reauth`/`transient`) back to a token / `ReauthRequiredError` / plain `Error`. Platform portability is preserved via the `ITokenProvider` abstraction on `AppEnv` (`src/lib/token-provider.ts`; CF impl `DOTokenProvider` in `src/platform/do-token-provider.ts`; a self-hosted adapter wraps the same `refreshAcumaticaToken()` helper in a distributed lock). When a refresh fails, the shared `refreshAcumaticaToken()` helper classifies by **HTTP status, not the OAuth error string**: a `5xx`/`429` is the only genuinely transient case (IdentityServer up but momentarily unhappy — the same refresh token may succeed on retry) and throws a plain `Error`; any other failure (all `4xx` — `invalid_grant`, `invalid_request`, `invalid_client`, etc.) means the refresh token will never start working again, so `getAcumaticaTokenForUser()` throws a distinct `ReauthRequiredError`. (Keying off the exact `invalid_grant` string was the original 0.32.0 bug — Acumatica returns a `400` whose body doesn't reliably parse to that code, so dead tokens fell through to the transient branch and the model looped forever on "please try again shortly" instead of re-authenticating. Fixed in 0.32.1.) A `token_refresh_failed` diagnostic line (status + error *code* only — never the body, which can echo `client_secret`) is logged for `wrangler tail`. No stored token or no refresh token also throws `ReauthRequiredError`. The DO's `callTool` catch then revokes the user's MCP grant(s) via `getOAuthApi(oauthProviderOptions, this.env)` — `env.OAUTH_PROVIDER` is injected only on the Worker request path, not on the DO's env, so the helpers are reconstructed from the shared `oauthProviderOptions`. With the grant gone, the next `/mcp` request fails bearer validation (401 + `WWW-Authenticate: ... error="invalid_token"`) and the client silently re-runs OAuth instead of the user manually disconnecting/reconnecting. Transient failures (5xx/429, network) throw a plain `Error` and do **not** revoke, so a blip can't evict the user. The grant `userId` is the Acumatica username and all of a user's grants share the one per-user Acumatica token, so revoke-all is correct — each client re-auths independently on its next call. The current tool turn still returns the error text (the streamable-http transport has already committed a 200 for the in-flight request and a tool handler can't turn that into a 401 mid-stream); the re-auth kicks in on Claude's automatic retry.

9. **Role-check misconfig vs. denial.** `checkUserRole()` returns a discriminated result (`granted | denied | misconfigured`). 200 → granted, 403 → denied (user-facing access denied page), 404/5xx/network → misconfigured (separate "Configuration Error" page that points at the likely cause: missing GI, wrong tenant, OData not enabled). Misconfig events are logged as `login_denied` with `reason: role_check_misconfigured` so admins can see real outages rather than them being hidden behind "access denied" tickets.

10. **Redaction regex concurrency.** `src/lib/redact.ts` no longer module-caches compiled regexes. The field-name regex is rebuilt per call (cheap; construction is cheaper than the walk), and the value-shape `SSN` / card regexes are per-call `new RegExp(...)` instances so the mutable `lastIndex` from the `g` flag can't race across concurrent redactions. The field regex drops the `g` flag entirely since it's only used with `.test(key)`.

11. **`unwrapFields` drops `custom`.** Acumatica's `custom` container holds user-defined extension fields in a deeply nested type-tagged wire format (`{"Document": {"UsrField": {"type": "...", "value": ...}}}`). It's user data, but surfacing it as-is would bloat responses and confuse the model. See the comment in `src/lib/acumatica-client.ts` — for workflows that need custom fields, extend the per-entity `acumatica_get_*` tool with `$expand=custom` and a flatten step rather than changing `unwrapFields()` globally.

12. **Registry-driven getters.** The 38 per-entity `acumatica_get_*` tools are defined as data in `src/tools/getter-registry.ts` (`GETTER_TOOLS`). Each entry describes an entity name, parameter list with defaults/optionality, and optional `$expand`. `src/index.ts` loops over the registry and registers each tool via a shared `runGetter()` handler. Adding a new single-record lookup is a ~7-line registry entry — no per-tool handler file, no per-tool `server.tool(...)` block. Utility/discovery tools that do more than a plain GET (pagination envelope, `$metadata` parse, cache invalidation) stay as dedicated handler files. **Endpoint-aware:** the getter entity names are curated for the stock `Default` endpoint; the base path honors `ACUMATICA_ENDPOINT_NAME` (see Config), and `runGetter()` re-messages a 404 on a non-`Default` endpoint via `endpointAware404Message()` (`src/tools/getter-errors.ts`) so "entity not exposed by this endpoint" reads distinctly from "wrong key." Registration is **not** conditional on a live entity catalog — the contract API requires a per-user token, so there's no auth-free way to enumerate the endpoint's entities at DO `init()`; the runtime 404 message is the seam instead.

13. **Config diagnostics.** `src/lib/preflight.ts` exposes a `runPreflight()` probe that exercises every external touch-point: `ACUMATICA_URL` reachable, OIDC discovery, Connected App `client_credentials` grant (distinguishes `invalid_client` — bad creds — from `unsupported_grant_type` — creds valid, grant disabled), tenant OData path (`/t/{tenant}/...` → 401 = exists, 404 = wrong tenant), and contract API endpoint version. Surfaced two places: the admin console (`/docs/admin/preflight` → on-demand diagnostic table) and the `/callback` token-exchange path (known OAuth errors like `invalid_client` / `invalid_grant` are rendered as targeted pages via `interpretTokenError()` instead of a generic 502). Only the `error` field of IdentityServer error bodies is read — other fields can echo the submitted form, which includes `client_secret`.

14. **One-shot deploy.** `setup.sh` at the repo root wraps the full Cloudflare setup (KV namespace create, R2 bucket create, in-place substitution of values into `wrangler.jsonc`, `wrangler secret put` for each secret, `wrangler deploy`). Idempotent — detects an existing KV id in `wrangler.jsonc` and reuses it; skips R2 creation if the bucket already exists; before overwriting `wrangler.jsonc` it saves the previous file to `wrangler.jsonc.local-backup` (gitignored). The substitution targets `ACUMATICA_URL`, `ACUMATICA_TENANT`, `ACUMATICA_ENDPOINT_VERSION`, and the KV `id` field (matches the empty placeholder shipped in the tracked template AND any prior real id, so re-running with the same answers is a no-op). `COOKIE_ENCRYPTION_KEY` is always generated fresh; `ADMIN_SECRET` is auto-generated if the user leaves the prompt blank (and printed once). After deploy, the script extracts the `*.workers.dev` URL from the deploy output, logs in with the just-set `ADMIN_SECRET`, and calls `/docs/admin/preflight/api` so Acumatica-side misconfig is surfaced in the terminal before the user ever opens a browser. The Acumatica-side prerequisites (Connected App, `MCP Access` role, `MCPAccess` GI) can't be automated and are called out as follow-ups. After first run, prints a hint to run `git update-index --skip-worktree wrangler.jsonc` so future setup re-runs / pulls don't fight with local values.

15. **One-line installer.** `install.sh` at the repo root is served by the worker at `/install.sh` (imported as a text module via the `**/*.sh` rule in `wrangler.jsonc`). Users run `curl -fsSL https://<worker>/install.sh | bash`; it checks for `git`/`node`/`npm`, clones the repo, `npm install`s, and `exec`s `./setup.sh < /dev/tty`. The `/dev/tty` redirect is load-bearing — when piped from curl, stdin is the pipe, so setup.sh's interactive prompts would otherwise immediately EOF. Served with `Content-Type: text/x-shellscript` and `Cache-Control: max-age=300`.

16. **GUI install via Deploy-to-Cloudflare button.** The README links `https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/hallboys/MCP4Acumatica`, which forks the repo to the user's GitHub, reads `wrangler.jsonc`, auto-creates the KV namespace and R2 bucket from the bindings declared with empty `id`/auto-creatable resources, prompts for secrets, and deploys. Vars (`ACUMATICA_URL`, `ACUMATICA_TENANT`, etc.) ship as placeholders that the user edits via the Cloudflare dashboard's `Variables and Secrets` UI after the first deploy — Cloudflare automatically redeploys when vars change. Custom-domain routes are commented out in the committed template; users add them via the Cloudflare dashboard or by editing `wrangler.jsonc` in their fork. This path is the only one that works with no terminal — every other step (Connected App, MCP Access role, MCPAccess GI, dashboard edits) is already a web UI.

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Acumatica as sole OAuth provider.** The MCP server redirects directly to Acumatica for login. No separate identity provider layer. See "Historical Note" below for why. The `/callback` route binds the OAuth `state` query parameter to an HttpOnly `acu_oauth_state` cookie set at `/authorize`; mismatch burns the KV state record (`acumatica_state:{state}`) as well as rejecting the request, so the record is single-use even on mismatch.

2. **Per-user Acumatica tokens.** Each MCP user gets their own Acumatica OAuth token stored in KV keyed by `user_token:{acumaticaUsername}`. The user's Acumatica role governs record-level access. The MCP server additionally requires the `MCP Access` role (gate check) and applies sensitive field redaction before returning data to Claude.

3. **`@cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider`** wraps the entire worker. It acts as an OAuth 2.1 server for Claude, handling both CIMD (Client ID Metadata Documents, preferred) and DCR (Dynamic Client Registration, fallback) for client registration, plus token issuance, etc. The `defaultHandler` (Hono app) manages the Acumatica OAuth redirect flow. The `apiHandler` (McpAgent DO) handles `/mcp` requests with bearer token auth. CIMD requires the `global_fetch_strictly_public` compatibility flag in wrangler.jsonc for SSRF protection.

4. **DO binding must be named `MCP_OBJECT`** — this is the default the `agents` SDK looks for in `McpAgent.serve()`. A second DO, `TOKEN_MANAGER` (class `TokenManager`), serializes per-user Acumatica token refresh (see Access Control #8); it's a plain `DurableObject` reached via RPC (`getAccessToken`/`setToken`), not an McpAgent.

5. **Acumatica field values** are wrapped as `{value: X}`. The `unwrapFields()` utility recursively strips these before returning data to Claude.

6. **`AppEnv` / `IKeyValueStore` abstraction.** Tool handlers and shared libraries (`config.ts`, `metadata-cache.ts`, `acumatica-oauth.ts`, `acumatica-client.ts`) use the platform-agnostic `AppEnv` type (which has `store: IKeyValueStore`) instead of the Cloudflare-specific `Env`. In `AcumaticaMcpServer.init()` we construct a fresh `this.appEnv: AppEnv` from `this.env` (never mutating the CF-provided binding object — that reference is shared across requests in the same isolate and hot-patching a `store` field onto it would leak state across sessions). `Env` no longer extends `AppEnv`; it only describes the CF bindings (plus Acumatica connection fields pulled from wrangler.jsonc). CF-specific code (auth handler, admin handler) uses raw `Env` / `KVNamespace` directly.

## Historical Note: Why We Removed Microsoft Entra ID

The initial design used a two-login chained OAuth flow: users first authenticated via Microsoft Entra ID (to identify who they are), then were chained to Acumatica OAuth (to get API permissions). This required a separate Entra app registration, three callback routes, and intermediate state management in KV.

We removed Entra ID entirely because:
- **It was redundant.** Since every user must authenticate with Acumatica anyway (to get a per-user API token with their role-based permissions), the Entra login added no value — Acumatica already knows who the user is.
- **Acumatica can use Entra SSO natively.** If an Acumatica instance is configured with Entra SSO, users still get the Microsoft login experience — it just happens through Acumatica's own login page, not through our MCP server.
- **Simpler flow.** One login instead of two. One callback route instead of three. No Entra secrets to manage.

Old Entra-related secrets (`ENTRA_CLIENT_ID`, `ENTRA_CLIENT_SECRET`, `ENTRA_TENANT_ID`) may still exist on the Cloudflare side and should be cleaned up with `wrangler secret delete`.

## Schema Knowledge Tools (0.34.0)

Four tools help power users build *against* Acumatica (discover entities/fields/relationships, read GI structure) rather than query business data. Architecture, shared with planned DAC + GI-XML workstreams: an **OSS ingestion script** (`scripts/`) the operator runs against a source they're licensed to access → a compact **private JSON index** in R2 (gitignored `.index/`, uploaded out-of-band) → **OSS tools** querying it. This keeps the build pipeline open-source while the derived index (instance-specific / licensed material) stays private.

- **Source.** `acumatica_search_schema` / `_get_schema_entity` / `_list_schema_entities` read `schema-index.json`, built from the instance's own `swagger.json` (contract API description, incl. customizations — no third-party IP). They answer offline (no tenant round-trip), complementing the *live* `acumatica_describe_entity` (`$adHocSchema`). `acumatica_explain_gi_xml` is **stateless** — it summarizes a pasted GI definition XML and needs no index, so it always registers.
- **Storage abstraction.** `IBlobStore` (`src/lib/blob-store.ts`; CF impl `CloudflareR2BlobStore`) on `AppEnv.indexStore`, backed by the `INDEX_STORE` R2 bucket (`mcp4acumatica-index`). `loadIndex()` (`src/lib/index-store.ts`) memoizes the parsed index per isolate; `indexExists()` is a cheap `R2.head` used at `init()` for **conditional registration** — the three index-backed tools register only when the index is present, so a deploy without a built index never advertises tools that would error.
- **Search.** Keyword + structured today, behind `ISchemaSearch` (`src/lib/schema-search.ts`) so a `VectorSchemaSearch` (Vectorize + Workers AI) can be added later without touching handlers.
- **Out of scope (by design):** Acumatica *documentation* lookups — the public Help Wiki (`help.acumatica.com`) is reachable via the AI client's own web search, so we don't vectorize/redistribute it. **DAC-layer metadata is intentionally NOT a tool** for the same reason: stock DACs are covered by Acumatica's public DAC Schema Browser (`help.acumatica.com/dacBrowser`, web-readable by the client), and the only gap — *custom* DACs/extensions — is best answered from the customization source the developer already has (API-exposed custom fields are already covered by the schema tools). A DAC-via-GI customization was prototyped and dropped (see `git log`) once this redundancy was clear. A GI XML *example* library remains a possible future workstream.

## Configuration

### Tracked deploy template:
- `wrangler.jsonc` — committed at repo root with placeholder values (`""` KV ids, `https://your-instance.acumatica.com`, etc.). Both install paths consume it: the "Deploy to Cloudflare" button reads it from a fork to auto-create bindings; `setup.sh` substitutes real values into it in place. Local production values (real KV id, hallboys-specific routes) are kept in the working tree but suppressed from `git status` via `git update-index --skip-worktree wrangler.jsonc`. The file `wrangler.jsonc.local-backup` is written by setup.sh before overwriting and is gitignored.

### Gitignored (instance-specific):
- `.dev.vars` — secrets for local dev
- `swagger.json` — instance OpenAPI spec
- `wrangler.jsonc.local-backup` — last pre-overwrite copy of `wrangler.jsonc`, written by setup.sh

### Other tracked templates:
- `.dev.vars.example` — documents required secrets

### Environment Variables (in wrangler.jsonc `vars`):
- `ACUMATICA_URL` — e.g., `https://your-instance.acumatica.com`
- `ACUMATICA_TENANT` — Acumatica tenant/login company name (e.g., `Production`). Used for OData GI endpoint URL.
- `ACUMATICA_ENDPOINT_VERSION` — `25.200.001`
- `ACUMATICA_ENDPOINT_NAME` — contract-API endpoint name (the `{name}` in `/entity/{name}/{version}`). Optional; defaults to `Default` (Acumatica's stock system endpoint). Override only when targeting a custom Web Service Endpoint (SM207060). A custom endpoint can rename/reshape entities, so the hardcoded names in `GETTER_TOOLS` are only guaranteed against `Default`. The getters are **endpoint-aware**: on a non-`Default` endpoint a 404 is re-messaged (via `endpointAware404Message()` in `src/tools/getter-errors.ts`) to tell the model the entity may simply not be exposed by that endpoint — distinct from a wrong key — and to confirm with `acumatica_describe_entity`/`acumatica_search_schema`. On `Default` the plain "verify the ID" message is kept.
- `ACUMATICA_MAX_RECORDS` — max rows per query (default `1000`). Runtime-overridable via `config:acumatica_max_records` in KV (set from the admin console).
- `ACUMATICA_MCP_ROLE` — Acumatica role name required to use MCP (default `"MCP Access"`)
- `REDACT_PATTERNS` — comma-separated additional field name patterns to redact (e.g., `CustomSSN,EmployeeNotes`)
- `REDACT_SKIP` — comma-separated field name patterns to whitelist from redaction (e.g., `BirthDate`)

### Secrets (via `wrangler secret put` or `.dev.vars`):
- `ACUMATICA_CLIENT_ID` — from Acumatica Connected Application (SM303010)
- `ACUMATICA_CLIENT_SECRET` — from Acumatica Connected Application
- `COOKIE_ENCRYPTION_KEY` — random 256-bit hex (`openssl rand -hex 32`)
- `ADMIN_SECRET` — password for the admin console at `/docs/admin`

### KV Namespaces:
- `TOKEN_STORE` — per-user Acumatica tokens, temporary OAuth state, metadata cache, and runtime config overrides (`config:*` prefix)
- `OAUTH_KV` — required by `@cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider` internally (points to the same physical namespace as `TOKEN_STORE`)

### R2 Buckets:
- `mcp4acumatica_logs` — long-term log storage via Logpush (requires Workers Paid plan for Logpush; R2 free tier: 10 GB)
- `mcp4acumatica-index` (binding `INDEX_STORE`) — schema-knowledge indexes (`schema-index.json`, future `dac-index.json`/`gi-examples-index.json`). Built offline by `scripts/` and uploaded with `npm run upload-index` (or auto by `setup.sh` post-deploy). Optional — the schema-knowledge tools degrade gracefully when the bucket is unbound or empty.

### Runtime Config (KV-backed):
Settings can be changed at runtime via the admin console at `/docs/admin/settings` without redeploying. KV overrides take precedence over env vars. Changes take effect when the next DO instance starts (DOs recycle within minutes on idle). Config keys stored in KV with `config:` prefix:
- `config:redact_patterns`, `config:redact_skip`
- `config:acumatica_max_records`

### Acumatica Connected Application (SM303010):
- **Redirect URI:** `https://mcp4acumatica.hallboys.com/callback` (plus `https://acumatica-mcp.hallboys.com/callback` while the legacy alias is still live, and the *.workers.dev URL if you use that too — every hostname users connect to must be listed)
- **Scope:** Not configured on the Connected Application — SM303010 has no scope field. The server requests `api openid profile email offline_access` in the `/authorize` URL (`offline_access` is REQUIRED — without it Acumatica issues no refresh token and sessions die when the ~1h access token expires).

### Acumatica Role & GI Prerequisites:
- **Role:** Create `MCP Access` role (SM201005). No permissions needed — it's a marker role for the canary GI gate check.
- **Generic Inquiry:** Create `MCPAccess` GI (SM208000). Can be trivial (any single column). Assign it only to the `MCP Access` role. Enable **Expose via OData**.
- **User assignment:** Assign the `MCP Access` role to users who should have AI assistant access.

## Acumatica Version Upgrades

When the connected instance moves to a new Acumatica release (e.g. 2025 R2 → 2026 R1) or is
repointed at a different instance/tenant, follow **`docs/upgrading-acumatica.md`** (served at
`/docs/upgrading-acumatica`). Summary of what's version-coupled in this server:

1. **`ACUMATICA_ENDPOINT_VERSION`** (contract base `/entity/Default/{version}`) — update the var, redeploy; preflight (`/docs/admin/preflight`) flags a wrong value.
2. **Schema-knowledge index** — re-export the instance's `swagger.json` and `npm run build-index` (0.34.0+); otherwise `acumatica_search_schema`/`_get_schema_entity`/`_list_schema_entities` describe the old shape. No redeploy needed; the next DO instance reads the new R2 object.
3. **Runtime metadata cache** — `acumatica_clear_cache` (entity `$adHocSchema`, GI list, GI field schemas are cached 24 h / 1 h).
4. **Access-control prerequisites** — `MCP Access` role + `MCPAccess` canary GI (OData-exposed) + Connected App (Authorization Code flow + redirect URIs; scopes are request-side, not configured on the app) survive upgrades but should be re-verified.
5. **Hardcoded entities** — `GETTER_TOOLS` (`src/tools/getter-registry.ts`) entity names are stable across releases but spot-check key entities and update entries if upstream renames/removes one.
6. **Two independent version numbers** — the **MCP server version** (`0.34.0`, bumps each release) vs. the **targeted Acumatica release** (the `25R2`/`26R1` *tag prefix*, changed only when re-targeting).

> **Maintenance instruction (standing):** whenever a feature is added that depends on the
> Acumatica version — a new index built from instance data (DAC, GI examples), a hardcoded
> endpoint/entity, a new cached artifact, or a published meta-GI — add its concrete upgrade
> step to `docs/upgrading-acumatica.md` (it has a "Forward-looking" section staging the
> planned ones). Treat this as part of finishing such a feature, not a follow-up.

## Commit / Push / Tag Checklist

Before every commit, push, or tag:

1. **Update documentation** — ensure all docs (`README.md`, `docs/*.md`) reflect any changes made in the commit.
2. **Update `CHANGELOG.md`** — add an entry for the new version (Keep a Changelog format, newest first; surfaced on the docs site at `/docs/changelog`).
3. **Update version strings in documentation** — if the tag is changing, update the version in:
   - `CLAUDE.md` → `Current tag` field in Project Overview
   - `docs/tool-reference.md` → version in the opening paragraph
   - `src/docs/docs-handler.ts` → `<span>v... &middot; 48 tools</span>` in the nav brand
   - `src/index.ts` → McpServer version string
   - `package.json` → `version` field
4. **Update the upgrade guide if relevant** — if the change adds/alters anything version-coupled (a new instance-derived index, a hardcoded endpoint/entity, a cached artifact, the targeted-release prefix), update `docs/upgrading-acumatica.md` accordingly.

## Close Session Procedure

When the user says **"close session"**, perform all of the following:

1. **Update CLAUDE.md** — ensure it reflects all changes made during the session
2. **Increment version** — bump the patch version (e.g., 0.22.0 → 0.22.1) unless a minor/major bump is warranted
3. **Update version strings** in:
   - `CLAUDE.md` → `Current tag` field in Project Overview
   - `docs/tool-reference.md` → version in the opening paragraph
   - `src/docs/docs-handler.ts` → `<span>v... &middot; 48 tools</span>` in the nav brand
   - `src/index.ts` → McpServer version string
   - `package.json` → `version` field
4. **Update `CHANGELOG.md`** — prepend an entry for the new version (newest first; shown at `/docs/changelog`)
5. **Commit** all changes with a descriptive message
6. **Push** to `origin/main`
7. **Tag** with `25R2-X.Y.Z` format
8. **Deploy** with `npx wrangler deploy` and verify the deployment succeeds

## Known Issues / Tech Debt

- **User identity retrieval:** The OIDC `/identity/connect/userinfo` endpoint (with `openid profile email` scopes) is the primary method. Falls back to `/entity/auth/25.200.001/UserSecurityInfo` which may not exist on all instances. If both fail, username defaults to a UUID-based key (breaks token reuse across sessions).
- **Acumatica system entities not available via contract API:** `User`, `UserRole`, and screen-based API (`/entity/Default/.../screen/SM201010`) all return 404 on SaaS instances. The canary GI approach for role checking was adopted because of this limitation.
- **`$select` on some entities causes Acumatica 500:** Some entities (e.g., Payment) return internal server errors when `$select` is used with certain field names. The `acumatica_list_entities` tool auto-retries without `$select` when this occurs.
- **`substringof(...) eq true` silently returns `[]`:** Acumatica's contract-REST `$filter` parser returns an empty set (HTTP 200, no error) for a boolean string function compared to a literal — `substringof('X', F) eq true` / `startswith(...) eq true` / `endswith(...) eq true` — but the *bare* function works. Models habitually append `eq true` (valid OData v3). `normalizeODataFilter()` (`src/lib/odata-filter.ts`) strips it server-side for both `acumatica_list_entities` and `acumatica_run_inquiry`. `eq false` is left verbatim — the only equivalent negation (`not substringof(...)`) 500s on the contract API. NOT a transport/encoding bug (an early parens-encoding hypothesis was disproven live).
- **Complex document entities can't be server-side `$filtered` on non-key fields:** PurchaseOrder, Shipment, PhysicalInventoryCount (and any filter that reaches a child collection, e.g. `StockItem/CrossReferences/AlternateID`) fail in two ways — (A) HTTP 500 from the OData filter binder (`CannotOptimizeException`, "type conversions not supported", "not a single value", "key not present") or (B) a *silent* `[]` even when matching rows exist (e.g. `substringof` on PurchaseOrder `VendorID`). A keyed filter (`OrderNbr`/`ShipmentNbr eq '...'`, topN=1) is optimizable and works; broad search must use a Generic Inquiry. `getFilterErrorKind()` (`src/lib/complex-entities.ts`) classifies mode-A 500s into a structured `filterNotApplicable` error; mode-B empties on the known-list entities get a `possibleFalseNegative` warning so the model doesn't conclude "no such record exists." The known-list is hardcoded — see `docs/upgrading-acumatica.md` §7.
- Old Entra ID secrets may still exist on Cloudflare — clean up with `wrangler secret delete ENTRA_CLIENT_ID`, etc.
- **Zod schema constraint:** MCP tool parameter schemas MUST use only simple types (`z.string()`, `z.string().optional()`, `z.string().default("value")`). Complex types like `z.record()`, `z.unknown()`, `z.number()` cause MCP SDK JSON Schema serialization failures and tools won't appear in client discovery. Use `z.string()` with manual `parseInt()` in the handler for numeric parameters.
- **ChatGPT CIMD bug (as of April 2026):** ChatGPT's MCP client sees `client_id_metadata_document_supported: true` in our metadata but fails to complete CIMD (it doesn't have its own metadata document URL) and does not auto-fallback to DCR. Users must manually select DCR when adding the server in ChatGPT. Our server correctly advertises both — this is a ChatGPT client-side issue.
- **Claude.ai tool list caching:** Claude.ai may cache the tool list from a previous Durable Object session. If tools appear stale, disconnect and reconnect the MCP server in Claude.ai to force a fresh `init()` call.
- **Claude.ai re-auth is not silent, and can get stuck:** When the server revokes a grant (dead Acumatica token → `ReauthRequiredError`), the 401 + `WWW-Authenticate` *should* let the client re-run OAuth invisibly. In practice Claude.ai surfaces a **reconnect prompt** rather than re-authing silently, and after a few failed attempts it caches the connector in a dead state and stops prompting entirely. Recovery for an **org-managed** connector is a **personal disconnect → reconnect** (the org-level "delete" is not available/needed to individual users) — this clears the stuck personal grant and starts a fresh `/authorize` flow. The `0.33.0` TokenManager DO removes the *spurious* revokes (rotation races) that were triggering this; genuine dead-token revokes still prompt.
- **`/authorize` 500 on an invalid `client_id`:** `app.get("/authorize")` calls `parseAuthRequest()` with no try/catch, so a malformed/unfetchable CIMD `client_id` throws → uncaught → HTTP 500 (rather than a clean 400). Harmless for real clients; only bites synthetic/manual probes with a bogus `client_id`.
- **No description metadata for Generic Inquiries.** The Acumatica GI Design form (SM208000) has no free-text "Description" field on the header — only `Inquiry Title` (a short label, often just a prettified name) and `Site Map Title` (set only for nav-pinned GIs). The OData GI service document returns `{name, url}` only; nothing richer is exposed. As a result, `acumatica_list_generic_inquiries` surfaces GIs by name alone, leaving the model to guess which GI matches a user's intent. Parametrized GIs are already excluded at list time (see `generic-inquiry-discovery.ts` — `$metadata` is scanned for `FunctionImport Name="..._WithParameters"` entries and those are filtered out), so the gap is narrowly about selection context for the surviving non-parametrized GIs. Potential cures:
  1. **MCP-side curation map.** KV-backed `gi_descriptions:{name} → text` edited from the admin console. Filter the list to GIs that have a description, inject the description into the response. Curation lives where it's consumed, zero Acumatica-side change. Downside: descriptions invisible inside Acumatica; admins must maintain a second list.
  2. **Acumatica-side meta-GI.** Admin publishes a `MCPGIIndex` GI whose rows are `(Name, Description)` pulled from a custom table or hand-maintained dataset. Visible inside Acumatica, but heavier setup and the descriptions live separately from the GI definitions themselves.
  3. **Extract GI definition (XML / GIQL) via API and auto-generate descriptions.** If Acumatica exposes the GI design body — tables joined, filters, output columns — through a screen-based API, OData $metadata annotations, or an export endpoint, feed each GI's structure to Claude Code (or any model) and have it produce a one-line description plus parameter/usage notes from the query itself. Cache the generated text alongside the existing GI metadata cache. Most automated of the three; requires verifying which API surface (if any) returns the design body on SaaS — historically system entities like `GenericInquiry` / `GIDesign` are not in the contract API (see the "system entities" note above), so this path likely depends on either a non-public endpoint or an admin-published export.

## MCP Client Compatibility (as of April 2026)

| Client | Registration | Status |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Claude.ai (Team/Pro/Max/Enterprise) | CIMD | ✅ Works — observed `client_id=https://claude.ai/oauth/mcp-oauth-client-metadata` (CIMD, not DCR as previously documented) |
| Claude Code (v2.1.81+) | CIMD preferred, DCR fallback | ✅ Works — publishes metadata at `https://claude.ai/oauth/claude-code-client-metadata` |
| Claude Desktop | DCR | ✅ Works — uses `/register` |
| ChatGPT | DCR (manual selection required) | ⚠️ Works with manual DCR — CIMD auto-detection broken on their side |

### OAuth Discovery Endpoints

The server responds on three well-known paths (all return identical metadata):
- `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` (and `/mcp` suffixed variant) — RFC 9728
- `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` — RFC 8414
- `/.well-known/openid-configuration` — added for ChatGPT compatibility (proxies to oauth-authorization-server)

## Acumatica API Patterns

### Endpoint format:
```
GET {ACUMATICA_URL}/entity/{ACUMATICA_ENDPOINT_NAME}/{version}/{Entity}/{key}
```
`ACUMATICA_ENDPOINT_NAME` defaults to `Default`. The client builds this base URL once in `AcumaticaClient` (`src/lib/acumatica-client.ts`); `Default` is no longer hardcoded.

### Common query parameters:
- `$expand=SubEntity1,SubEntity2` — include nested records
- `$filter=Field eq 'value'` — filter results
- `$select=Field1,Field2` — limit returned fields
- `$top=N` — limit result count

### Field value wrapping:
Every Acumatica field is `{value: X}`. Use `unwrapFields()` before returning to Claude.

### Auth header:
```
Authorization: Bearer {per-user-access-token}
```
