# AGENTS.md - Contributing to primer (for AI agents)

You are an AI agent working ON the primer codebase. This file is your contract
for making changes. (If instead you were connected to a running primer
deployment over MCP and want to USE it, read
[skills/using-primer-over-mcp.md](skills/using-primer-over-mcp.md).)

## 1. The working model: coordinator + parallel subagents

Development on this repo uses a coordinator/worker split:

- The **main session is a coordinator**. It does design, planning, dispatch,
  verification, and merge. It does NOT implement tasks directly.
- Each task gets its **own branch off `main`** and its **own git worktree**, so
  multiple workstreams proceed in parallel without colliding.
- A **subagent implements the task** inside that worktree.
- When the subagent reports done, the coordinator **critically verifies**
  completeness and quality against the Definition of Done (section 4). If it
  passes, the coordinator **merges the branch into `main`**. If not, the
  coordinator **re-dispatches the subagent** with specific fix instructions and
  re-verifies. Reviews are not rubber stamps: read the actual diff, run the
  tests, and reject work that masks a problem instead of fixing it.

### Per-task git worktree flow

```bash
# create the task branch + an isolated checkout (sibling dir)
git worktree add -b feat/<task-slug> ../primer-<task-slug> main
# ... subagent works and commits inside ../primer-<task-slug> ...
# after verification, from the main checkout:
git merge --no-ff feat/<task-slug>
git worktree remove ../primer-<task-slug>
git branch -d feat/<task-slug>
```

The Agent tool's `isolation: "worktree"` option automates the create/cleanup of
the per-task worktree; prefer it when dispatching an implementer.

Constraints that always hold: branch off `main`, never force-push `main`,
conventional commit messages with NO `Co-Authored-By` footer, stage only the
files a task touches (never `git add -A`).

## 2. Project setup and structure

- **Stack:** Python 3.12, `uv`, FastAPI, asyncio, Postgres + pgvector, a
  vanilla-React (JSX, no build step) console.
- **Setup:** `uv sync --all-extras` (the optional backends - huggingface,
  docling, lance, channels, docker, kubernetes - live behind extras; the dev
  and test env needs them all); Postgres via `docker compose up -d postgres`; run with
  `uv run primer api` (starts the API plus an in-process worker). A dogfood
  instance is expected to stay healthy on `:9000` between tasks.
- **Layout:**
  - `primer/<subsystem>/` - the backend, one package per subsystem: `api`,
    `model`, `agent`, `chat`, `session`, `worker`, `claim`, `graph`,
    `workspace`, `channel`, `toolset`, `llm`, `embedder`, `vector`, `trigger`,
    `bus`, `mcp`, `harness`, `storage`, `bootstrap`, and more.
  - `ui/` - the operator console (JSX components, `window`-exported pages,
    a hash router).
  - `primectl/` - the CLI client over the REST API.
  - `tests/` - `tests/<subsystem>/` unit tests, `tests/e2e/` end-to-end against
    a live server, `tests/ui_e2e/` Playwright, `tests/distributed/`,
    `tests/docs/` hygiene.
  - `docs/dev/` - the authoritative developer reference (architecture +
    subsystems). `docs/agents/` - agent-usage docs served as internal AI docs
    (ingested into the `_internal_ai_docs` collection; see
    `docs/agents/_README.md`). The operator-facing console docs now live in a
    separate external repo (the `primerhq.github.io` Pages site), not in this
    tree.
  - `skills/` - guidance for agents using a primer deployment (not contribution).

## 3. Read before you change anything

Start at [docs/dev/README.md](docs/dev/README.md) for the doc-set map and
subsystem dependency graph, then read
[docs/dev/CONTRIBUTING.md](docs/dev/CONTRIBUTING.md) (required reading order,
PR conventions, common pitfalls).

Before changing a subsystem, read the cross-cutting patterns in
[docs/dev/architecture/](docs/dev/architecture/) that it touches:

- [provider-pattern](docs/dev/architecture/provider-pattern.md) - the
  discriminated-config + registry + factory shape used by every provider.
- [storage](docs/dev/architecture/storage.md) - the `Storage[T]` abstraction,
  lazy per-model tables, JSONB layout, and the query model.
- [rest-api](docs/dev/architecture/rest-api.md) - `make_crud_router`, the six
  CRUD ops, and the RFC7807 `ProblemDetails` error envelope every path returns.
- [claim-machine](docs/dev/architecture/claim-machine.md) and
  [worker-system](docs/dev/architecture/worker-system.md) - leases, claiming,
  the park/resume model.
- [observability](docs/dev/architecture/observability.md) and
  [auto-bootstrap](docs/dev/architecture/auto-bootstrap.md).

Then read the matching `docs/dev/subsystems/<name>.md` for the feature you are
working on.

## 4. Definition of Done

A change is NOT complete until every applicable track below is done. The
coordinator verifies each before merging. The detailed how-to for each track is
in [docs/dev/CONTRIBUTING.md](docs/dev/CONTRIBUTING.md) section 2; this is the
checklist.

1. **Backend** - models in `primer/model/`, storage wiring, REST routes under
   `primer/api/routers/` following the rest-api conventions, RFC7807 errors,
   observability hooks.
2. **UI** - implement or update the respective console components in `ui/`
   (page component, route, sidebar entry, mobile adaptation, loading/error/empty
   states, toasts). A backend feature with no console surface is incomplete.
3. **System tools** - if the change adds new functionality, expose it as new
   tools in the appropriate toolset under `primer/toolset/` (built with
   `make_tool`, registered for internal-collection ingestion, callable over
   `POST /v1/mcp`), so agents and MCP clients can use it.
4. **Docs** - update the agent-usage docs in `docs/agents/` plus the dev docs
   in `docs/dev/subsystems/` and `docs/dev/architecture/` as the change
   warrants. The operator-facing docs now live in a separate external repo (the
   `primerhq.github.io` Pages site); update them there when an operator-visible
   surface changes.
5. **Unit tests** - add or extend unit tests for new models, helpers, routes,
   and components.
6. **E2E tests** - add or extend end-to-end coverage under `tests/e2e/` (or
   `tests/ui_e2e/`) for the user-visible flow.
7. **Regressions** - run the suites, capture any regressions in existing tests,
   and fix them. Do not merge with a red suite; do not weaken a test to hide a
   real regression - fix the cause.
8. **primectl** - if the change introduces a new API/endpoint, update the
   `primectl` CLI so it stays in parity with the REST surface.

If a track is genuinely not applicable, say so explicitly with a one-line
reason rather than skipping it silently.

## 5. Running tests (read this - the e2e suite is CPU-exclusive)

- **Narrowed unit sweep** (must stay green at every commit, parallel, ~90s):

  ```bash
  uv run pytest tests/ -q --ignore=tests/distributed --ignore=tests/ui_e2e \
    --ignore=tests/e2e --ignore=tests/integration --ignore=tests/llm
  ```

  Add `-n0` to run a single module serially while debugging.

- **E2E suite saturates all CPU cores and must run EXCLUSIVELY.** Before any
  e2e run, check for an already-running one and kill it first:

  ```bash
  pgrep -af "pytest tests/e2e" | grep -v pgrep   # kill any match before starting
  ```

  Never run two e2e runs at once. Bring the environment up with
  `scripts/e2e/bringup.sh` (it reuses the shared dev Postgres on a separate
  `primer_e2e` database). Do NOT run `scripts/e2e/teardown.sh` with volume
  removal: it shares the Postgres container with the dogfood instance and will
  wipe it. Run targeted e2e with `-n0` and `PRIMER_RUN_E2E=1 PRIMER_E2E_PORT=8765`.

- Some tests are environment-gated: real-LLM tests need a reachable LM Studio
  (`LMSTUDIO_API_KEY` set; the provider must use `max_concurrency: 1` for a
  single-request backend); the Kubernetes workspace tests need a live cluster.

- After a code-changing task, restart the dogfood `uv run primer api` and
  confirm `/v1/health` returns 200.

---

## 6. Hard rules

- Never the em-dash character (U+2014) in committed files; the `tests/docs/`
  hygiene suite enforces this for `docs/dev/` and `AGENTS.md`.
- Every relative markdown link from `AGENTS.md` or `docs/dev/` must resolve.
- Keep `AGENTS.md` and the architecture/subsystem docs in sync with the code:
  the hygiene suite asserts the architecture and subsystem doc sets exist.
