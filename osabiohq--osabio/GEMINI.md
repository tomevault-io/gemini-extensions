> - When making examples (in docs, research, discussions, commit messages), use real-world business domain examples (e.g. supply chain disruption, customer refund, compliance audit), not developer-centric examples (e.g. merge PR, deploy service, fix bug). Osabio is a general-purpose coordination system, not a developer tool.

## Communication

- When making examples (in docs, research, discussions, commit messages), use real-world business domain examples (e.g. supply chain disruption, customer refund, compliance audit), not developer-centric examples (e.g. merge PR, deploy service, fix bug). Osabio is a general-purpose coordination system, not a developer tool.

## Git Commits

- Always use `--no-verify` when committing. The pre-commit hook requires `osabio init` which is not available in worktree environments.
- Always use `-s` (GPG sign) when committing.

## Deferred Work

- Deferred work (out-of-scope items, future enhancements, known limitations) must always be created as GitHub issues. Do NOT leave deferred work only as comments in code, TODOs in docs, or notes in wave-decisions files — create a GitHub issue so it is tracked and discoverable.

## Data Value Contract

- Never persist, publish, or return `null` for domain data values (Surreal records, API payloads, events, UI state).
- Absence must be represented by omitted optional fields only (`field?: Type`), not by `null`.
- If `null` appears in domain data, treat it as a contract violation and fix the producer. Do NOT sanitize/coerce it at consumers.

## TypeScript Conventions

- Do NOT use `null`. Use `undefined` via optional properties (`field?: Type`) instead.
- Do NOT create wrapper/helper functions for simple operations. Cast directly with `as`.
- Type result payloads once and avoid repetitive per-field casting.
- Do NOT use module-level mutable singletons (e.g. `let cache` at file scope) for caching or shared state. Module-level state is shared across the entire process — when multiple server instances run concurrently (e.g. smoke tests with `--concurrent`), they silently corrupt each other. Pass shared state via dependency injection or use per-instance caches scoped to the owning object.

## Internationalization

- Use the `Intl` API for all locale-sensitive formatting: `Intl.RelativeTimeFormat` for relative time, `Intl.DateTimeFormat` for dates, `Intl.NumberFormat` for numbers.
- Do NOT hand-roll formatting logic (e.g. custom "5m ago" strings). The `Intl` API handles locale, pluralization, and grammar rules automatically.

## Browser-Facing Route Authentication

- Browser-facing routes (UI pages, client-side fetches) must resolve identity from the Better Auth session, NOT from `X-Osabio-Identity` headers. The header-based pattern is for MCP/CLI clients only.
- Use `deps.auth.api.getSession({ headers: request.headers })` to get the session, then resolve identity via `identity_person` edge: `SELECT VALUE in FROM identity_person WHERE out = $person LIMIT 1`.
- Return 401 if no session or identity is found.
- See `tool-registry/routes.ts:resolveIdentityFromSession()` or `policy/policy-route.ts:resolveIdentityFromSession()` for reference implementations.

## Agentic Design: No Hardcoded Modes

- Do NOT introduce hardcoded processing modes (e.g. `"deterministic" | "llm"`) when behavior should be workspace-configurable via data.
- This is an agentic system — capabilities are defined by workspace admins through definitions, not by code branches. If something can be expressed as a definition with configurable logic, it should be.
- Avoid dual-path dispatchers that route between "built-in" and "dynamic" implementations. One path, driven by data. See ADR-038 for the precedent.

## Failure Handling

- Do NOT add fallback logic that masks invalid state, malformed payloads, or contract violations.
- Fail fast: throw immediately when required data is missing or does not match the expected shape.
- Prefer explicit hard failures over silent degradation, synthetic defaults, or "best effort" recovery.
- Only introduce fallback behavior when explicitly requested, and document the reason in code comments.
- Never silently ignore errors (e.g. empty `.catch(() => {})`). Always surface them via logging or re-throw.

## Graph Node Types

- Read @README.md § "Key Concepts" for graph node types and § "Architecture" for the layered architecture diagram.

## Server Architecture Overview

- Entrypoint is `app/server.ts`; it only calls `startServer()` from `app/src/server/runtime/start-server.ts`.
- Runtime bootstrap is split into:
  - `runtime/config.ts` (env parsing/validation)
  - `runtime/dependencies.ts` (Surreal + model clients)
  - `runtime/start-server.ts` (route registration + Bun server startup)
- HTTP cross-cutting concerns live in `app/src/server/http`:
  - `instrumentation.ts` (`withTracing()` — wide-event span per request with business context)
  - `response.ts` (JSON/headers helpers)
  - `parsing.ts` (request/form-data parsing)
  - `errors.ts` + `observability.ts` (error/log primitives)
- SSE state management is isolated in `app/src/server/streaming/sse-registry.ts`.
- Route/business domains are separated by workflow:
  - `auth/*` for authentication (Better Auth, OAuth, DPoP)
  - `workspace/*` for workspace create/bootstrap/scope checks
  - `chat/*` for ingress, chat agent, async message processing
  - `entities/*` for entity search, detail, actions, and work item accept endpoints
  - `onboarding/*` for onboarding state and guided replies
  - `extraction/*` for extraction generation, persistence, dedupe/upsert, and context loaders
  - `agents/*` for specialized subagent implementations (PM agent, analytics agent)
  - `observation/*` / `observer/*` for observation CRUD and Observer scan endpoints
  - `intent/*` for intent creation/evaluation
  - `mcp/*` for MCP server endpoints (context, decisions, observations, constraints)
  - `orchestrator/*` for orchestrator session management
  - `learning/*` for learning CRUD endpoints
  - `policy/*` for policy CRUD, versioning, and lifecycle
  - `objective/*` for objective CRUD and progress tracking
  - `behavior/*` for behavior scoring and definitions
  - `proxy/*` for proxy compliance, sessions, spend, and traces
  - `feed/*` for governance feed and feed streaming
  - `webhook/*` for GitHub webhook integration
  - `iam/*` for identity/access management
- `tools/*` for shared AI SDK tool definitions (used by chat agent, PM agent, observer, proxy)
- `graph/*` contains reusable Surreal graph queries used by tools and higher-level workflows.

## MCP Protocol: outputSchema and structuredContent (Draft Spec)

- The MCP draft spec adds `outputSchema` (optional JSON Schema) to tool definitions alongside `inputSchema`. When a tool declares an `outputSchema`, its `CallToolResult` includes both `content` (text blocks for backwards compat) and `structuredContent` (typed JSON conforming to the schema).
- The `output_schema` field exists in the SurrealDB schema (`mcp_tool` table) but must also be present in all TypeScript types that represent tools: `McpToolRecord`, `ToolDetail`, `ToolSyncDetail`, `ResolvedTool`.
- Discovery must capture `outputSchema` from MCP `tools/list` responses and store it as `output_schema`.
- The proxy must forward `output_schema` when injecting tools into LLM requests and handle `structuredContent` in `CallToolResult` responses from upstream MCP servers.
- Reference: https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/draft/server/tools#output-schema

## Proxy Auth: X-Osabio-Auth Header Format

- The `X-Osabio-Auth` header value is the **raw proxy token** — no `Bearer ` prefix. The value is passed directly to `hashProxyToken()` (SHA-256) and matched against `proxy_token.token_hash` in SurrealDB.
- Sending `Bearer <token>` corrupts the hash: `sha256("Bearer osb_...")` ≠ `sha256("osb_...")`.
- CLI sets it as `X-Osabio-Auth: ${proxyToken}`, not `X-Osabio-Auth: Bearer ${proxyToken}`.
- `extractOsabioAuthToken()` in `proxy-auth.ts` returns the raw header value (trim only, no prefix stripping).

## Test Environment Split

- Client tests (`app/src/client/**/*.test.tsx`) require happy-dom for DOM APIs. Run them with `bun --config=bunfig.client.toml test app/src/client/` (or `bun run test:client`).
- Unit tests (`tests/unit/`) and acceptance tests (`tests/acceptance/`) must NOT load happy-dom — it replaces `globalThis.fetch` with an incompatible implementation that breaks HTTP calls to the in-process server.
- The default `bunfig.toml` has no `[test]` preload. Only `bunfig.client.toml` preloads `setup-dom.ts` and `setup-testing-library.ts`.
- When adding new client component tests, place them under `app/src/client/` and run via `test:client`. Never add DOM preloads to the root `bunfig.toml`.

## Development Paradigm

- Full-stack TypeScript (Bun backend + React frontend).
- Backend: `app/src/server/` routes and domain modules (for example `*/routes.ts`, plus shared HTTP utilities in `app/src/server/http/`).
- Frontend: `app/src/client/routes/` + `app/src/client/components/`.
- When a feature spans both, split into two `/nw-deliver` runs: backend API first, frontend consuming it second.
