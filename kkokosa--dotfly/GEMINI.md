# CLAUDE.md — dotFly Project Guide

## Project Identity

**dotFly** is a native C#/.NET 11 inference engine for fly-connectome spiking models (MaleCNS v1.0,
FlyWire v630/v783) — a library that Godot, console apps and experiments link in-process. Sibling of
the dotLLM project in conventions and spirit; read `PLAN.md` for the design.

- **License**: GPLv3 (code). Data: CC BY 4.0, downloaded separately, never vendored.
- **Target framework**: `net11.0` (RC/preview SDK pinned in `global.json`).
- **Reference model**: Shiu et al. 2024 LIF, `philshiu/Drosophila_brain_model@91bdd1e7` `model.py`. The
  equations and step order in `PLAN.md` §2 are the definition of "correct".

## Non-negotiables

1. **Honesty in wording.** Never describe the simulation as a digital fly, an upload, or a brain
   that "plays" a game. The graph is measured; equations, encoders and decoders are engineering
   choices and must be labelled *fixed*, *calibrated* or *trained* wherever they appear.
2. **Exact integer IDs.** Body/root IDs are `ulong`; never pass them through `double`/`float`.
3. **Determinism.** Same checkpoint + options + seed ⇒ identical spikes, independent of thread count
   on CPU. Any change that breaks this needs a test that proves it did not.
4. **Zero allocations on the step path.** State in `NativeBuffer<T>`; no LINQ, no closures, no
   `Task` per step. Scratch via `ArrayPool<T>.Shared`, returned promptly.
5. **Report neural time, simulated duration and wall time separately.** Never conflate them.

## Code Style & Conventions

- File-scoped namespaces; `readonly record struct` for small value types; `Span<T>` in signatures.
- `[MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.AggressiveInlining)]` on small hot-path methods; `[SkipLocalsInit]`
  on performance-critical methods.
- XML doc comments on all public APIs; `TreatWarningsAsErrors` is on in `src/`.
- Units: mV and ms inside `Core`/`Cpu`; user-facing helpers (`Hz()`, `Ms()`) live in `Engine`.
- Kernels are generic over `TFloat : IBinaryFloatingPointIeee754<TFloat>`; `double` is the reference,
  `float` the fast path. No `Half`.
- SIMD: `Vector512/256/128<T>` cross-platform APIs first, platform intrinsics only when measured
  faster; always a scalar fallback.
- Library projects are `IsAotCompatible`; the CLI opts out (Spectre.Console.Cli reflection).
- `InternalsVisibleTo("DotFly.Tests.Unit")` is the only allowed way for tests to reach internals.

## Engine threading contract

- `Simulation` methods run on one thread (the caller of `Run`/`Advance` or the `RealtimeDriver`
  thread). `InputPort.Write/Fill`, `OutputPort.Snapshot`, the causal switches and the read-only
  properties are safe from any thread; writes take effect at the next `Advance`.
- Use `Reset(seed)` for trials, not a new `Simulation` (constructing one rebuilds the blocked CSR).

## Hosting (Godot and other engines)

- A host that builds in Debug drags referenced projects into Debug: pin the dotFly references with
  `SetConfiguration="Configuration=Release"` (see `samples/DotFly.Sample.Godot`), or the kernel is 25× slower.
- The model has runaway attractors at gain 1.0 (optic lobe under one-sided LC4; antennal lobe /
  mushroom body under *any* ORN input). The 3D sample keeps gain 1.0 by silencing Kenyon cells +
  `lLN*` (`FlyBrain3D.StabilityControl`); `dotfly run --stim-seconds` shows whether a readout
  returns to baseline after the stimulus. Say so on screen whenever a control is applied.
- Until .NET 11 GA, hosts with their own runtime config need `DOTNET_ROLL_FORWARD_TO_PRERELEASE=1`.
- Never pin the caller thread inside a host (default off; `DOTFLY_PIN_CALLER=1` for CLI experiments).

## Hot-path rules learned in M2

- `[MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.AggressiveOptimization)]` on every method that runs per step
  (kernel, batch loop, delivery, inputs): without it the tiered JIT leaves them at tier-0/OSR for
  most of a short run (3.5× slower). Verify with `DOTFLY_PROFILE=1 dotfly run …`.
- Per-step work must stay block-local: a block touches only its own `v/g/countdown/blocked bits`
  and spike lists published ≥ delay steps earlier. That is what allows one barrier per 18-step batch
  and bit-identical results for any thread count — keep it that way.
- Vector and scalar paths of `LifKernel` must stay bit-identical (same operations, same order, no
  FMA contraction); `Vector_And_Scalar_Kernel_Paths_Are_Bit_Identical` guards it.
- Every optimisation lands with `dotfly bench` numbers for the three standard scenarios
  (v630 sugar, MaleCNS idle, MaleCNS `type:T4a`).

## Data

- `.data/` (git-ignored) holds the downloaded releases, built `.dfb` checkpoints and the Brian2 venv
  (`.data/venv-brian2`, Brian2 2.9 + numpy < 2.4 + pandas + pyarrow + joblib). See README for the
  download/build commands. Never commit anything from `.data/`.
- Integration tests locate `.data/` by walking up from the test binary, or via `DOTFLY_DATA`.

## Brian2 semantics that are easy to get wrong (all verified, all covered by tests)

- `(unless refractory)` guards **every** write to v and g except the reset: deliveries and input
  events to a refractory neuron (spike step through `t+R−1`) are discarded, not accumulated.
- Poisson targets have `rfc = 0`; an event landing in the same step as a spike is discarded.
- Silencing = zero outgoing weights; the neuron still spikes.
- Delivery of a step-*t* spike happens in step `t + 18`; reset (v = vrst, g = 0) after delivery.
- Exact integrator constants come from `NeuronModel.Discretize`; never Euler.

## Testing

- `dotnet test -c Release` (MTP runner). Unit tests must be data-free and fast.
- Golden traces: hand-derived first, then Brian2-generated fixtures under `tests/.../Fixtures/`
  produced by `tools/brian2_golden.py` with explicit input spike trains (no RNG in the loop).
- Integration tests that need real releases are opt-in and skip when the data path is not set.

## Working Rules

- Read `PLAN.md` before starting a feature; update it (and `docs/findings.md` / `docs/roadmap.md`) when a
  decision changes or a finding lands. M0–M4.5 are the initial prototype; F1–F4 are features (GitHub issues).
- Every optimisation lands with a BenchmarkDotNet number in the PR description.
- Commit messages end with the attribution line given by the session's system reminder.
