### Research Pipeline Tiers

Fast-track requires a monthly pre-approved topic list in research-tracker. Falls back to full process if editorial score < 4.0/5.

**Daily**: morning-briefing, daily-email-summary, news-briefing, deal-flow-triage, portfolio-news
**Weekly**: deal-sourcing (Wed), weekly-pipeline (Mon), weekly-market-note (Mon), research-calendar-check (Mon), editorial-calendar

> Additional tasks in `modules/fund-ops/scheduled/` (5) and `modules/extras/scheduled/` (11)

## Safety Rules

1. **Email**: ALL Gmail actions produce DRAFTS ONLY. Never auto-send.
2. **Financial Data**: All xlsx modifications must be verifiable.
3. **External Communications**: Always require user review before any external send.
4. **Valuations**: Flag methodology and confidence level on all changes.
5. **Compliance**: Escalate overdue items with increasing urgency.
6. **Confidentiality**: Never expose portfolio company details or deal terms publicly.
7. **Publications**: All research requires user review before publishing.
8. **Portfolio References**: Anonymize in public research unless explicitly approved.

## State Layer (data/state/)

JSON is the canonical machine-readable state. xlsx in `data/fund/` remains as human-readable views.

| File | Purpose | xlsx Counterpart |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| `deals.json` | Deal pipeline | deal-tracker.xlsx |
| `portfolio.json` | Portfolio companies | portfolio-dashboard.xlsx |
| `research.json` | Research pipeline | research-tracker.xlsx |
| `public_holdings.json` | Public positions | public-companies.xlsx |
| `watchlist.json` | Watch list | watchlist.xlsx |
| `running-jobs.json` | Multi-session job tracker | — |
| `evolution-log.json` | Agent learning audit trail | — |
| `schema.json` | JSON Schema for all above | — |

**Read/write JSON first**, then optionally regenerate xlsx via `sync-state-to-xlsx.md`. JSON is git-diffable and avoids binary merge conflicts.

## Knowledge Base (Karpathy Pattern)

The wiki is a **living, LLM-compiled knowledge graph**. The human drops sources into `raw/`, the LLM compiles them into `wiki/`, and queries feed back into the wiki over time.

### Ownership
- `raw/` — **human's domain**. Source documents. LLM never modifies.
- `wiki/` — **LLM's domain**. Human rarely edits directly. LLM maintains, links, lints.
- `output/queries/` — query answers. Valuable ones get filed back into wiki.

### Workflow
1. Human drops file into `raw/deals/`, `raw/research/`, etc.
2. Run `/ingest` — LLM reads raw, updates wiki articles, maintains `_index.md` and `_summaries.md`
3. Run `/query "question"` — LLM researches against wiki, supplements with web, saves answer
4. Run `/lint-wiki` weekly — find stale data, broken links, missing entities
5. Run `/ingest --full` occasionally — full rebuild when wiki quality degrades

### The Compounding Effect
Every query adds to the wiki. Week 1: 5 company articles. Month 3: cross-cutting insights emerge automatically. The wiki becomes the competitive advantage — it knows deal flow history, market patterns, counterparty track records.

### Learnings vs. Wiki

The wiki stores **objective domain knowledge** ("Company X raised $50M Series C"). Learnings store **processing experience** ("When searching for Series C rounds, include the term 'growth round' to catch non-standard naming"). The wiki helps agents know *what*; learnings help agents know *how*. Both compound over time, but learnings are agent-specific while wiki is shared.

## Agent Evolution Framework

GPilot agents are self-evolving. They learn from mistakes, accumulate processing experience, and improve over time — zero external dependencies, all file-based.

### Three-Tier Memory

| Tier | Location | What | Who Writes | When Read |
|------|----------|------|-----------|-----------|
| **Preferences** | `learnings/preferences.md` | User corrections, output preferences | Auto after user corrections (2+) | Session start |
| **Wiki** | `wiki/` | Objective domain facts | `/ingest`, `/query` feedback loop | During research |
| **Learnings** | `learnings/{agent}.md` | Processing experience, tool tips, workflow tricks | Agent reflection after tasks | Agent startup |

### Session Startup Protocol

At the beginning of every session:
1. Check `data/state/running-jobs.json` — are there jobs in progress from previous sessions?
2. If yes, inform the user: "I see {N} jobs in progress: {list}. Want to continue one?"
3. Read `learnings/preferences.md` for user preferences
4. When launching any agent, that agent reads its own `learnings/{agent}.md` first

### Reflection Protocol

After completing any multi-step task (commands, agent workflows):
1. Agent self-assesses: what went well, what was unexpected, what was a workaround?
2. If a reusable insight was gained, append to `learnings/{agent}.md`
3. If user corrected output, note the correction pattern in `learnings/preferences.md`
4. Update `data/state/running-jobs.json`: mark job completed or update progress
5. If the task produced wiki-worthy facts, suggest wiki updates (existing pattern)

### Running Jobs

Multi-session jobs are tracked in `data/state/running-jobs.json`. Commands like `/research`, `/source-deals`, and `/deal-screen` that may span sessions should:
- Register a job entry when they start (status: in_progress)
- Update progress as steps complete
- Mark completed when finished
- Mark abandoned if the user cancels

### Evolution Tracking

Agent improvement events are logged to `data/state/evolution-log.json`. This enables periodic review via `/review-learnings` of what agents have learned and how effective their learnings are.

### Evolution Loop

```
Agent startup → reads learnings (past experience)
             → reads wiki (domain knowledge)
             → reads state (current situation)
             → executes task
             → auto-updates wiki/state
             → agent reflects → appends learnings
             → next session auto-loads this experience
```

## Working Conventions

- **Knowledge Base**: Drop sources into `raw/`, run `/ingest`. Query with `/query`. Lint with `/lint-wiki`.
- **Wiki**: Read `wiki/_index.md` first for any research task. The wiki is the primary knowledge source.
- **State**: Read/write `data/state/*.json` for machine operations. Use `data/fund/*.xlsx` for human review.
- **Deals**: Check `deals/{company}/` for local analysis AND `projects/` for cloud materials.
- **Comps**: Use `data/comps/` sector models for valuations and market analysis.
- **xlsx**: Read `data/fund/` workbooks via the `xlsx` skill.
- **Documents**: Use `templates/` for generation. Use `docx` skill for memos, `pdf` for deliverables.
- **Research**: English first → translate via `skills/translator/` skill → review via `skills/editor/` skill.
- **Deep research**: Use `skills/deep-researcher/` skill (Perplexity MCP primary) over basic WebSearch.
- **Fast-track**: For pre-approved Market Notes and Insight Letters, use `/research-fast-track` instead of `/research`.
- **Learnings**: Agents read `learnings/{agent}.md` on startup. Append new learnings after each task via the Reflection Protocol.
- **Running Jobs**: Check `data/state/running-jobs.json` at session start for in-progress work.
- **Preferences**: Check `learnings/preferences.md` for user output and workflow preferences.
- **Cross-platform**: If symlinks fail (Linux/Windows), use MCP tools per `projects/ACCESS.md`.

## Cross-Machine Sync

| Machine | Role | Sync |
|---------|------|------|
| Primary desktop | Automation hub, cron jobs | Git pull (scheduled) |
| Laptop | Daily work | Git push/pull (manual) |
| Secondary | Backup | Git pull |
