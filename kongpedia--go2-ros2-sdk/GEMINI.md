# go2_ros2_sdk (C++ / ROS 2) Rules

- Use C++17-compatible code.
- Prefer clear ownership semantics (RAII) and avoid raw `new/delete`.
- Keep node execution non-blocking; avoid long blocking loops in callbacks.
- If adding nodes, prefer ROS 2 best practices (parameters, QoS explicitness).
- Keep build system changes minimal and localized.
