# Hodstack

Hodstack makes coding agents more productive. It has two parts: a set of skills and a cli.

The work happens in one repository: `hodstack/hodstack`. It holds two directories:

- **`skills`** — the skills, as text. The directory uses the Agent Plugins standard. One tree supplies Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Copilot, VS Code and other clients. For the layout, the rules and the package formats, refer to `skills/AGENTS.md`.
- **`cli`** — the `hod` program. The command `hod <skill> <prompt>` starts a coding agent with that skill and that prompt. For the rules, refer to `cli/AGENTS.md`.

Change the skill and the command that runs it in one commit and release them under one tag.

The files `install.sh` and `install.ps1` and the directory `npm/` at the top of the repository install the `hod` binary. `cli/AGENTS.md`, section 6, controls them.

Three files at the top of the repository control each directory: `.gitignore`, `typos.toml` and `LICENSE.md`. Give a path in `.gitignore` and in `typos.toml` the prefix `/cli/` or `/skills/`, because the file sits one directory above them. Do not write a second file with one of these names in a directory.

## 1. The reader of an `AGENTS.md` file

Each `AGENTS.md` file in this repository is for a coding agent. No user reads it. Write an instruction that an agent obeys during its work, then stop. Do not write an introduction, a conclusion, an argument for a decision that the project made, or a sentence that no agent can obey. Give a reason only when the reason changes the next decision of the agent.

Start each rule with a verb in the imperative. Put the condition before the instruction. Give the exact path, the exact command and the exact name that the agent must use. If a rule needs a test, give the command that does the test.

The public files are different. `README.md`, the website, the release notes and the `description` in each manifest are for a user. Section 3 controls them.

## 2. How to write an `AGENTS.md` file

Write in [ASD-STE100](https://www.asd-ste100.org) Simplified Technical English: one instruction in one sentence, the imperative, the active voice, one meaning for one word, no contraction, and no synonym for variety. The standard holds the full rules. Do not copy them here. Four items keep their exact form: a quotation from a standard, an identifier in the code, a path or a command, and a name from a different supplier.

Write GitHub flavored Markdown. Put one `#` heading in a file. Write one paragraph on one line, thus a change stays small in `git diff`. Number the sections of a long file, thus a different file can point to "section 3". Put a path, a command and a name from the code in `code font`.

Write the intention of the project in this file. Write a decision about one directory in the `AGENTS.md` file of that directory. If this file and the `AGENTS.md` file of a directory disagree, obey this file and correct the other file.

A change to this file can make a rule below it wrong. After you change this file, read the `AGENTS.md` file of each directory and correct each rule that your change makes wrong. Do this in the same commit.

Write no new rule. This is the correct result of each task, and a task that adds a command, a module or a workflow does not change it. A rule needs a fault that happened: name the decision that you made wrong, or name the decision that these files refused to give you. A wrong change that you imagine is not a fault, thus write no rule to protect the code that you write today.

Write no rule for a fact that a name, a type, a test, a manifest or `git log` holds. Put the fact in the code first: a test stops the agent that breaks it, and a rule does not.

Ask the user before you write a rule. Give the fault, then write the rule in one sentence after the user agrees. Keep the length of the file: delete a rule in the same change, or ask the user to accept a longer file. A correction from the user is a rule and needs no question: write it in a file before you continue the work.

Give no new part of the program its own section, because the code of that part holds its design. Delete text that follows the order of a file of source code: that text describes the file, and the file describes itself. Replace an old rule. Do not add a second rule near it. Delete a rule that the project does not obey. Do not keep a record of what the project stopped doing, in a file or in a directory. Git holds the history.

## 3. How to write the public text

These rules control `README.md`, the website, the release notes, the announcement and the `description` in each manifest. Sections 1 and 2 do not control these files.

The voice is calm and certain. Say what the project does, then stop. Do not say that the project is fast, simple, powerful or intelligent. Show the command and let the reader form that opinion. Cut each superlative. Cut each sentence that a competitor can also write about itself.

Write for one person and call that person "you". Put the result first and the mechanism second. Keep the sentences short, and let one sentence stand alone when it carries the idea. A demonstration is the strongest argument: one command in a terminal is worth one paragraph of adjectives.

The care is in the small parts. The alignment of the output, the words in an error message, the space around the text on the page: the reader feels this work before the reader reads one sentence. The project is for people who enjoy their work, thus the text is warm. Put one dry joke on one page, at the most. Do not explain it.

Obey three limits. Do not promise a feature that does not exist today. Do not give a number without its source. Do not name a different product to make a comparison.

---

## 4. How to write the code

These rules control each file of source code and each manifest in this repository. Sections 1, 2 and 3 do not control these files.

Write no comment. Delete each comment that you find in a file that you change. Turn off the lint that asks for a documentation comment, because that lint asks you to say the name of an item again.

Put the intention in the code. Give each item a name that says what the item does. Give each value a type that makes a wrong value impossible. Split a long function into two functions with two names. A name and a type stay correct, and a comment does not.

Write a reason that the code cannot hold in the `AGENTS.md` file of that directory, with the path of the code. Do not write it above the code.

When a library reads the text of a comment as data, such as the description of a command on a help screen, write that text in an attribute or a field of that library instead.

A tool that writes a comment into a file that it owns keeps that comment. Do not delete it: the tool fails until it writes the comment again.
