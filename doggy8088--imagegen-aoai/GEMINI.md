## imagegen-aoai

> Generate or edit raster images when the task benefits from AI-created bitmap visuals such as photos, illustrations, textures, sprites, mockups, or transparent-background cutouts. Use when Codex should create a brand-new image, transform an existing image, or derive visual variants from references, and the output should be a bitmap asset rather than repo-native code or vector. Do not use when the task is better handled by editing existing SVG/vector/code-native assets, extending an established icon or logo system, or building the visual directly in HTML/CSS/canvas.


# Image Generation Skill

Generates or edits images for the current project (for example website assets, game assets, UI mockups, product mockups, wireframes, logo design, photorealistic images, or infographics).

## Execution mode and rules

This skill uses the bundled Azure OpenAI CLI at `scripts/image_gen.js`. GitHub Copilot CLI does not provide built-in image-generation or image-viewing tools, so do not reference or attempt to use nonexistent built-ins.

The CLI exposes three subcommands:

- `generate`
- `edit`
- `generate-batch`

Rules:
- Use `scripts/image_gen.js` for normal image generation and editing requests.
- If the user explicitly asks for a transparent image/background, start with the default `gpt-image-2` chroma-key workflow: prompt for a flat removable chroma-key background, then remove it locally with the installed helper at `$CODEX_HOME/skills/.system/imagegen/scripts/remove_chroma_key.js`.
- Never silently switch from CLI `gpt-image-2` to CLI `gpt-image-1.5`. Treat this as a model/path downgrade and ask the user before doing it, unless the user has already explicitly requested `gpt-image-1.5` or `scripts/image_gen.js`.
- If a transparent request appears too complex for clean chroma-key removal, asks for true/native transparency, or local removal fails validation, explain that true transparency requires CLI `gpt-image-1.5 --background transparent --output-format png` because `gpt-image-2` does not support `background=transparent`, then ask whether to proceed. Run the `gpt-image-1.5` path only after the user confirms.
- The word `batch` by itself does not require `generate-batch`. Use `generate-batch` when a multi-asset request is naturally represented as a JSONL batch; otherwise run individual CLI commands.
- Live API calls require Azure OpenAI credentials and network access.
- Use the bundled `scripts/image_gen.js` workflow. Do not create one-off SDK runners.
- Never modify `scripts/image_gen.js`. If something is missing, ask the user before doing anything else.

Output policy:
- Write generated assets directly to the requested path, or to `output/imagegen/` when the user does not specify a path.
- If the image is meant for the current project, save the final selected image in the workspace before finishing.
- Do not overwrite an existing asset unless the user explicitly asked for replacement; otherwise create a sibling versioned filename such as `hero-v2.png` or `item-icon-edited.png`.

Shared prompt guidance lives in `references/prompting.md` and `references/sample-prompts.md`.

CLI docs/resources:
- `references/cli.md`
- `references/image-api.md`
- `references/codex-network.md`
- `scripts/image_gen.js`

Local post-processing helper:
- `$CODEX_HOME/skills/.system/imagegen/scripts/remove_chroma_key.js`: removes a flat chroma-key background from a generated image and writes a PNG/WebP with alpha. Prefer auto-key sampling, soft matte, and despill for antialiased edges.

## When to use
- Generate a new image (concept art, product shot, cover, website hero)
- Generate a new image using one or more reference images for style, composition, or mood
- Edit an existing image (inpainting, lighting or weather transformations, background replacement, object removal, compositing, transparent background)
- Produce many assets or variants for one task

## When not to use
- Extending or matching an existing SVG/vector icon set, logo system, or illustration library inside the repo
- Creating simple shapes, diagrams, wireframes, or icons that are better produced directly in SVG, HTML/CSS, or canvas
- Making a small project-local asset edit when the source file already exists in an editable native format
- Any task where the user clearly wants deterministic code-native output instead of a generated bitmap

## Decision tree

Think about two separate questions:

1. **Intent:** is this a new image or an edit of an existing image?
2. **Execution strategy:** is this one asset or many assets/variants?

Intent:
- If the user wants to modify an existing image while preserving parts of it, treat the request as **edit**.
- If the user provides images only as references for style, composition, mood, or subject guidance, treat the request as **generate**.
- If the user provides no images, treat the request as **generate**.

Edit semantics:
- CLI edit mode accepts local image file paths via `--image`.
- If the user provides attached images or references from the conversation, save them locally first if the environment supports that; otherwise ask the user for local file paths.
- Use repeated `--image` flags for multi-image edits. Their order is meaningful, so label each image by index and role in the prompt.
- For edits, preserve invariants aggressively and save non-destructively by default.

Execution strategy:
- Use the CLI `generate-batch` subcommand for many prompts/assets when JSONL batching is the clearest workflow.
- For many distinct assets, do not use `n` as a substitute for separate prompts. `n` is for variants of one prompt; distinct assets need distinct CLI commands or distinct `generate-batch` jobs.

Assume the user wants a new image unless they clearly ask to change an existing one.

## Workflow
1. Decide the CLI subcommand: `generate`, `edit`, or `generate-batch`.
2. Decide the intent: `generate` or `edit`.
3. Decide whether the output is preview-only or meant to be consumed by the current project.
4. Decide the execution strategy: single asset vs repeated CLI commands vs CLI `generate-batch`.
5. Collect inputs up front: prompt(s), exact text (verbatim), constraints/avoid list, and any input images.
6. For every input image, label its role explicitly:
   - reference image
   - edit target
   - supporting insert/style/compositing input
7. If the edit target is on the local filesystem, pass it to the CLI with `--image`.
8. If the user asked for a photo, illustration, sprite, product image, banner, or other explicitly raster-style asset, use this image-generation skill rather than substituting SVG/HTML/CSS placeholders. If the request is for an icon, logo, or UI graphic that should match existing repo-native SVG/vector/code assets, prefer editing those directly instead.
9. Augment the prompt based on specificity:
   - If the user's prompt is already specific and detailed, normalize it into a clear spec without adding creative requirements.
   - If the user's prompt is generic, add tasteful augmentation only when it materially improves output quality.
10. Use `scripts/image_gen.js` with `gpt-image-2` by default.
11. For transparent-output requests, follow the transparent image guidance below: generate on a flat chroma-key background, run the installed `$CODEX_HOME/skills/.system/imagegen/scripts/remove_chroma_key.js` helper, and validate the alpha result before using it. If this path looks unsuitable or fails, ask before switching to CLI `gpt-image-1.5`.
12. Inspect outputs and validate: subject, style, composition, text accuracy, and invariants/avoid items.
13. Iterate with a single targeted change, then re-check.
14. For preview-only work, write to `output/imagegen/` unless the user asked for a different location.
15. For project-bound work, write the artifact into the workspace and update any consuming code or references.
16. For batches or multi-asset requests, persist every requested deliverable final in the workspace unless the user explicitly asked to keep outputs preview-only. Discarded variants do not need to be kept unless requested.
17. Use the CLI docs for model, quality, size, `input_fidelity`, masks, output format, output paths, and network setup.
18. Always report the final saved path(s) for any workspace-bound asset(s), plus the final prompt or prompt set.

## Transparent image requests

Transparent-image requests use the default `gpt-image-2` chroma-key workflow first. Because `gpt-image-2` does not expose a true transparent-background control, create a removable chroma-key source image and then convert the key color to alpha locally.

Default sequence:
1. Use `scripts/image_gen.js generate` to generate the requested subject on a perfectly flat solid chroma-key background.
2. Choose a key color that is unlikely to appear in the subject: default `#00ff00`, use `#ff00ff` for green subjects, and avoid `#0000ff` for blue subjects.
3. After generation, keep the chroma-key source image in the workspace or `tmp/imagegen/`.
4. Run the installed helper path, not a project-relative script path:
   ```bash
   node "${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/skills/.system/imagegen/scripts/remove_chroma_key.js" \
     --input <source> \
     --out <final.png> \
     --auto-key border \
     --soft-matte \
     --transparent-threshold 12 \
     --opaque-threshold 220 \
     --despill
   ```
5. Validate that the output has an alpha channel, transparent corners, plausible subject coverage, and no obvious key-color fringe. If a thin fringe remains, retry once with `--edge-contract 1`; use `--edge-feather 0.25` only when the edge is visibly stair-stepped and the subject is not shiny or reflective.
6. Save the final alpha PNG/WebP in the project if the asset is project-bound.

Prompt transparent requests like this:

```text
Create the requested subject on a perfectly flat solid #00ff00 chroma-key background for background removal.
The background must be one uniform color with no shadows, gradients, texture, reflections, floor plane, or lighting variation.
Keep the subject fully separated from the background with crisp edges and generous padding.
Do not use #00ff00 anywhere in the subject.
No cast shadow, no contact shadow, no reflection, no watermark, and no text unless explicitly requested.
```

Do not automatically use CLI `gpt-image-1.5 --background transparent --output-format png` instead of chroma keying. Ask the user first when the user asks for true/native transparency, when local removal fails validation, or when the requested image is complex: hair, fur, feathers, smoke, glass, liquids, translucent materials, reflective objects, soft shadows, realistic product grounding, or subject colors that conflict with all practical key colors.

Use a concise confirmation like:

```text
This likely needs true native transparency. The default path uses a chroma-key background plus local removal, but true transparency requires a gpt-image-1.5 Azure OpenAI deployment because gpt-image-2 does not support background=transparent. It also requires Azure OpenAI credentials. Should I proceed with that gpt-image-1.5 path?
```

## Prompt augmentation

Reformat user prompts into a structured, production-oriented spec. Make the user's goal clearer and more actionable, but do not blindly add detail.

Treat this as prompt-shaping guidance, not a closed schema. Use only the lines that help, and add a short extra labeled line when it materially improves clarity.

### Specificity policy

Use the user's prompt specificity to decide how much augmentation is appropriate:

- If the prompt is already specific and detailed, preserve that specificity and only normalize/structure it.
- If the prompt is generic, you may add tasteful augmentation when it will materially improve the result.

Allowed augmentations:
- composition or framing hints
- polish level or intended-use hints
- practical layout guidance
- reasonable scene concreteness that supports the stated request

Not allowed augmentations:
- extra characters or objects that are not implied by the request
- brand names, slogans, palettes, or narrative beats that are not implied
- arbitrary side-specific placement unless the surrounding layout supports it

## Use-case taxonomy (exact slugs)

Classify each request into one of these buckets and keep the slug consistent across prompts and references.

Generate:
- photorealistic-natural — candid/editorial lifestyle scenes with real texture and natural lighting.
- product-mockup — product/packaging shots, catalog imagery, merch concepts.
- ui-mockup — app/web interface mockups and wireframes; specify the desired fidelity.
- infographic-diagram — diagrams/infographics with structured layout and text.
- scientific-educational — classroom explainers, scientific diagrams, and learning visuals with required labels and accuracy constraints.
- ads-marketing — campaign concepts and ad creatives with audience, brand position, scene, and exact tagline/copy.
- productivity-visual — slide, chart, workflow, and data-heavy business visuals.
- logo-brand — logo/mark exploration, vector-friendly.
- illustration-story — comics, children’s book art, narrative scenes.
- stylized-concept — style-driven concept art, 3D/stylized renders.
- historical-scene — period-accurate/world-knowledge scenes.

Edit:
- text-localization — translate/replace in-image text, preserve layout.
- identity-preserve — try-on, person-in-scene; lock face/body/pose.
- precise-object-edit — remove/replace a specific element (including interior swaps).
- lighting-weather — time-of-day/season/atmosphere changes only.
- background-extraction — transparent background / clean cutout. Use the default chroma-key removal workflow first for simple opaque subjects; ask before using CLI true transparency for complex subjects.
- style-transfer — apply reference style while changing subject/scene.
- compositing — multi-image insert/merge with matched lighting/perspective.
- sketch-to-render — drawing/line art to photoreal render.

## Shared prompt schema

Use the following labeled spec as shared prompt scaffolding for both top-level modes:

```text
Use case: <taxonomy slug>
Asset type: <where the asset will be used>
Primary request: <user's main prompt>
Input images: <Image 1: role; Image 2: role> (optional)
Scene/backdrop: <environment>
Subject: <main subject>
Style/medium: <photo/illustration/3D/etc>
Composition/framing: <wide/close/top-down; placement>
Lighting/mood: <lighting + mood>
Color palette: <palette notes>
Materials/textures: <surface details>
Text (verbatim): "<exact text>"
Constraints: <must keep/must avoid>
Avoid: <negative constraints>
```

Notes:
- `Asset type` and `Input images` are prompt scaffolding, not dedicated CLI flags.
- `Scene/backdrop` refers to the visual setting. It is not the same as the CLI `background` parameter, which controls output transparency behavior.
- Execution notes such as `Quality:`, `Input fidelity:`, masks, output format, and output paths belong to the CLI path, not the prompt text.

Augmentation rules:
- Keep it short.
- Add only the details needed to improve the prompt materially.
- For edits, explicitly list invariants (`change only X; keep Y unchanged`).
- If any critical detail is missing and blocks success, ask a question; otherwise proceed.

## Examples

### Generation example (hero image)
```text
Use case: product-mockup
Asset type: landing page hero
Primary request: a minimal hero image of a ceramic coffee mug
Style/medium: clean product photography
Composition/framing: wide composition with usable negative space for page copy if needed
Lighting/mood: soft studio lighting
Constraints: no logos, no text, no watermark
```

### Edit example (invariants)
```text
Use case: precise-object-edit
Asset type: product photo background replacement
Primary request: replace only the background with a warm sunset gradient
Constraints: change only the background; keep the product and its edges unchanged; no text; no watermark
```

## Prompting best practices
- Structure prompt as scene/backdrop -> subject -> details -> constraints.
- Include intended use (ad, UI mock, infographic) to set the mode and polish level.
- Use camera/composition language for photorealism.
- Only use SVG/vector stand-ins when the user explicitly asked for vector output or a non-image placeholder.
- Quote exact text and specify typography + placement.
- For tricky words, spell them letter-by-letter and require verbatim rendering.
- For multi-image inputs, reference images by index and describe how they should be used.
- For edits, repeat invariants every iteration to reduce drift.
- Iterate with single-change follow-ups.
- If the prompt is generic, add only the extra detail that will materially help.
- If the prompt is already detailed, normalize it instead of expanding it.
- See `references/cli.md` and `references/image-api.md` for model, `quality`, `input_fidelity`, masks, output format, and output-path guidance.
- For transparent images, use the chroma-key workflow unless the request is complex enough to need true CLI transparency; ask before switching to CLI `gpt-image-1.5`.

More principles shared by both modes: `references/prompting.md`.
Copy/paste specs shared by both modes: `references/sample-prompts.md`.

## Guidance by asset type
Asset-type templates (website assets, game assets, wireframes, logo) are consolidated in `references/sample-prompts.md`.

## gpt-image-2 CLI guidance

The CLI defaults to `gpt-image-2`.

- Use `gpt-image-2` for new CLI/API workflows unless the request needs true model-native transparent output.
- If a transparent request may need true transparency, ask before using `gpt-image-1.5` unless the user already explicitly requested `gpt-image-1.5` or `scripts/image_gen.js`. Explain that the chroma-key path is the default, but true transparency requires `gpt-image-1.5` because `gpt-image-2` does not support `background=transparent`.
- `gpt-image-2` always uses high fidelity for image inputs; do not set `input_fidelity` with this model.
- `gpt-image-2` supports `quality` values `low`, `medium`, `high`, and `auto`.
- Use `quality low` for fast drafts, thumbnails, and quick iterations. Use `medium`, `high`, or `auto` for final assets, dense text, diagrams, identity-sensitive edits, or high-resolution outputs.
- Square images are typically fastest to generate. Use `1024x1024` for fast square drafts.
- If the user asks for 4K-style output, use `3840x2160` for landscape or `2160x3840` for portrait.
- `gpt-image-2` size may be `auto` or `WIDTHxHEIGHT` if all constraints hold: max edge `<= 3840px`, both edges multiples of `16px`, long-to-short ratio `<= 3:1`, total pixels between `655,360` and `8,294,400`.

Popular `gpt-image-2` sizes:
- `1024x1024` square
- `1536x1024` landscape
- `1024x1536` portrait
- `2048x2048` 2K square
- `2048x1152` 2K landscape
- `3840x2160` 4K landscape
- `2160x3840` 4K portrait
- `auto`

## CLI mode

### Temp and output conventions
- Use `tmp/imagegen/` for intermediate files (for example JSONL batches); delete them when done.
- Write final artifacts under `output/imagegen/`.
- Use `--out` or `--out-dir` to control output paths; keep filenames stable and descriptive.

### Dependencies
Use npm for dependency management in this repo.

Required Node packages:
```bash
npm install
```

Portability note:
- If you are using the installed skill outside this repo, install dependencies into that environment with its package manager.
- The CLI uses Node built-in `fetch` for Azure OpenAI calls and `sharp` for local chroma-key removal/downscaling.

### Environment
- `IMAGEGEN_AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT` and `IMAGEGEN_AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY` must be set for live API calls.
- `IMAGEGEN_AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION` is optional; the CLI defaults to `2025-04-01-preview`. `OPENAI_API_VERSION` is also accepted for compatibility.
- `IMAGEGEN_AZURE_OPENAI_IMAGE_DEPLOYMENT` is optional; it supplies the default `--model` value when set. Otherwise `--model` defaults to `gpt-image-2`.
- In Azure OpenAI, `--model` is the image deployment name, not necessarily the base model name.
- Never ask the user to paste the full key in chat. Ask them to set it locally and confirm when ready.

If the key is missing, give the user these steps:
1. Create or locate an Azure OpenAI resource with an image model deployment.
2. Set `IMAGEGEN_AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT` and `IMAGEGEN_AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY` as environment variables.
3. Optionally set `IMAGEGEN_AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION` and `IMAGEGEN_AZURE_OPENAI_IMAGE_DEPLOYMENT`.
4. Offer to guide them through setting the environment variables for their OS/shell if needed.

If installation is not possible in this environment, tell the user which dependency is missing and how to install it into their active environment.
