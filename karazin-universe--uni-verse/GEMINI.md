# UniVerse Project - Copilot Instructions

You are an expert AI programming assistant helping build the "UniVerse" platform.
The project is a monorepo managed with **Turborepo** and **pnpm workspaces**.

## Core Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js 15 (App Router), React, Tailwind CSS.
- **Backend:** NestJS, Node.js.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM.
- **Language:** Strict TypeScript across the entire repository.

## Coding Style & Best Practices

### 1. Code Style & Naming Conventions

- **Variables/Functions**: Use `camelCase`.
- **Classes/Components**: Use `PascalCase`.
- **Constants**: Use `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`.
- **Props & Parameter Order**: In type/interface definitions and component destructuring, declare fields without default values first, followed by optional fields and fields with default values.
- **Meaningful Names over Short Abbreviations**: Always use descriptive, self-explanatory names for variables, parameters, and callback arguments. Avoid single-letter or cryptic abbreviations (e.g. use `course` instead of `c`, `user` instead of `u`, `error` instead of `e`).
- **Vertical Spacing**: Maintain clear vertical spacing (empty lines) between logical code blocks:
  - Between variable/constant declarations and subsequent logic blocks.
  - Between conditional statements (`if`/`else`), loops, and following function calls.
  - Always keep an empty line before `return` statements.
- Always write strict TypeScript. Avoid `any`, `unknown` (unless strictly necessary), and implicit types.
- Shared interfaces, types, and DTOs should be placed in the `@universe/types` package to be imported by both frontend and backend.
- Favor explicit return types for all functions.

### 2. UI Components Architecture (`packages/ui`)

- All shared UI components MUST be placed inside `packages/ui/src/components/`.
- **Design System Components**: Core, simple, and reusable components (like buttons, inputs) go into `packages/ui/src/components/una/`.
- **Complex Components**: Composite, business-logic-heavy, or non-design system components go into `packages/ui/src/components/complex/`.
- **Component Types Extraction (`.types.ts`)**: For React UI components with non-trivial prop interfaces or data models, extract types into a co-located `<ComponentName>.types.ts` file (e.g. `Chart.types.ts` adjacent to `Chart.tsx`). Re-export types from the component file or module index for backwards compatibility. Do NOT create separate `.types.ts` files for simple utilities, single helper functions, or trivial components to avoid unnecessary fragmentation.

### 2. Backend (NestJS)

- Follow Clean Architecture.
- **Controllers** should only handle HTTP routing, request parsing, and response formatting.
- **Services** should contain all business logic.
- **Prisma** should be injected as a service for database access (managed via the `@universe/database` package).
- Always use dependency injection and keep modules highly cohesive.

### 3. Frontend (Next.js & React)

- Prioritize **React Server Components (RSC)**. Use client components (`"use client"`) only when interactivity or browser APIs (like `useState`, `useEffect`, `window`) are required.
- Push the `"use client"` directive as far down the component tree as possible (to the leaf nodes).
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling. Follow a mobile-first responsive design approach.
- Optimize performance using Next.js caching (`fetch` cache, `unstable_cache`) and React hooks (`useMemo`, `useCallback`) where appropriate.

### 4. Monorepo (Turborepo)

- Keep packages isolated. Do not use relative paths `../../../` to access code outside of the current workspace. Use the package names instead (e.g., `import { Button } from '@universe/ui'`).
- Ensure `package.json` dependencies correctly reference workspace packages (`"workspace:*"`).

### 5. Git Flow & Commits

- **Branch Naming**: Use standard prefixes such as `feature/`, `bugfix/`, `hotfix/`, `chore/` followed by a descriptive name (e.g., `feature/user-auth`).
- **Commit Messages**: Follow Conventional Commits format (e.g., `feat: add user login`, `fix: correct typo in header`, `chore: update dependencies`).

### 6. General AI Instructions

- Before generating code, think through the architecture and how it fits into the monorepo structure.
- When fixing bugs, explain _why_ the bug occurred before providing the code.
- Write clean, self-documenting code. Add comments only for complex logic or business rules.
- Prefer smaller, focused PRs and commits.
- **No Premature Backwards Compatibility / Legacy Shims (No "Backtracking")**:
  - When moving, renaming, or refactoring code (such as migrating components into `@universe/ui` or renaming functions/mixins), **never** create backwards-compatibility aliases, re-export proxies, wrapper functions, or deprecated shim files (e.g., `export { Button as SimpleButton } from '@universe/ui'` inside deprecated paths).
  - Directly update all call sites, imports, and usages across the entire codebase to the new location/name.
  - Completely delete obsolete files and aliases. We are an active internal monorepo with no external library consumers — maintain zero legacy dead code and zero transitional proxy layers.

### 7. AI Code Review Culture & Complexity Management

Since we actively use AI for code generation, you (as an AI Reviewer) must enforce a strict, uncompromising review culture to keep the codebase clean, simple, and maintainable. Act as a rigorous Principal Software Engineer.

Evaluate the code strictly against these failure modes:

1. **OVER-ENGINEERING & PREMATURE ABSTRACTION (Complexity):** Flag any abstract classes, factories, generic wrappers, or layers that solve hypothetical future problems rather than immediate requirements. Review the code from a perspective of complexity: if 5 lines of direct, simple code suffice, reject any 50-line generalized architecture. Always look for opportunities to simplify the code.
2. **DRY VIOLATIONS & DUPLICATION:** Enforce DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles. Ensure the author reuses existing core components, local helpers, and shared UI libraries (`packages/ui`) instead of creating duplicate implementations.
3. **TASK INTENT & ARCHITECTURAL MATCH:** Ensure the code precisely matches architectural requirements and the specific task intent. Strictly flag any code that hallucinates extra features, adds out-of-scope functionality, or strays from the original requirements.
4. **AI SLOP & VERBOSITY:** Flag excessive defensive checks, redundant comments explaining what the code does, dead code, or unnecessary helper utilities commonly generated by AI.
5. **REGRESSION PREVENTION:** Look critically at whether the proposed changes break existing logic elsewhere in the system.
6. **SECURITY:** Review the code from a security perspective. Flag any potential vulnerabilities (e.g., injections, insecure data handling, missing authorization).
7. **ACCESSIBILITY (a11y):** Review UI components from an accessibility perspective. Ensure proper ARIA roles, keyboard navigability, and sufficient contrast.
8. **LEGACY SHIMS & RETROACTIVE RE-EXPORTS (Backtracking):** Flag any backwards-compatibility aliases, proxy re-exports, or transitional wrapper shims introduced during refactoring. Require the author to update all consumer imports directly and remove obsolete files.

Output requirements for Review:

- Rate findings by severity.
- For every issue found, quote the exact lines, explain the concrete maintenance burden it introduces, and provide a simpler, direct replacement snippet.
- Prefer NO finding over a weak or speculative nitpick. If the code is clean, simple, and matches the intent, output "LGTM - No architectural bloat detected."

### 8. Design System Strict Rules (UniDesign)

All strict rules regarding the usage of colors, typography, spacing, shadows, and animations are documented in `docs/design-system-rules.md`. You MUST read this document and strictly adhere to its rules when working on UI components.
