> Boz Weather Trader is a free, open-source automated trading bot for Kalshi weather prediction markets. It fetches weather forecast data from NWS and Open-Meteo, generates probability distributions for temperature outcomes, compares them to Kalshi market prices, and executes trades when it finds positive expected value (+EV).

# Boz Weather Trader — Project Guide

## What This Project Is

Boz Weather Trader is a free, open-source automated trading bot for Kalshi weather prediction markets. It fetches weather forecast data from NWS and Open-Meteo, generates probability distributions for temperature outcomes, compares them to Kalshi market prices, and executes trades when it finds positive expected value (+EV).

**PRD:** See `PRD.md` for the full product requirements document (v0.5+).

**Algo history & performance:** See `docs/ALGO_CHANGELOG.md` for the running history of every change to *how the bot predicts and decides trades* (prediction pipeline, probability model, EV/risk logic, order execution), each paired with its measured live-performance effect, plus dated performance reviews. **Read it before modifying prediction or trading logic, and before any performance review. Update it whenever a change alters prediction/probability/EV/sizing/risk/execution behavior, and append a snapshot whenever a performance review is run.**

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Python 3.11+, FastAPI, Celery + Redis, PostgreSQL
- **Frontend:** Next.js 14+, React, Tailwind CSS, PWA (Workbox)
- **ML/Stats:** scipy, numpy, XGBoost, scikit-learn (Gaussian CDF + multi-model ML ensemble: XGBoost + Random Forest + Ridge)
- **Monitoring:** prometheus-client, Prometheus, Grafana (auto-provisioned dashboards), Alertmanager (webhook alerts)
- **Containerization:** Docker + Docker Compose (10 services incl. Prometheus, Grafana, Alertmanager, updater sidecar) + persistent `modeldata` volume (ML models + source weights) + `docker-compose.prod.yml` production overrides + `docker-compose.cloud.yml` cloud override (no monitoring) + `docker-compose.override.yml` (git-ignored, personal deployment config)
- **Testing:** pytest (backend), Jest/Vitest (frontend)
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions + GitHub Releases (automated via `.github/workflows/release.yml`)
- **Versioning:** Single source of truth `VERSION` file, `/api/version` endpoint with GitHub Releases update check, self-update via updater sidecar (`POST /api/version/update`)
- **Linting:** ruff (Python), ESLint + Prettier (TypeScript)

## Critical Rules (All Agents Must Follow)

### Security — Non-Negotiable
- **NEVER** log API keys, private keys, or any secret values
- **NEVER** expose API keys in frontend code, API responses, or error messages
- RSA private keys must be AES-256 encrypted at rest
- Keys are only decrypted in-memory when making Kalshi API calls
- All secrets come from environment variables or Docker secrets, never hardcoded

### Testing — Mandatory
- Every module ships with tests. No code is complete without tests.
- External APIs (NWS, Open-Meteo, Kalshi) are ALWAYS mocked in tests — never hit real APIs
- Coverage targets: >80% backend, >70% frontend
- Safety tests are required for any code touching: order placement, risk limits, API keys, position sizing
- Run `pytest` before considering any backend work "done"
- Run `npm test` before considering any frontend work "done"

### Code Style
- Python: Follow ruff defaults. Type hints on all function signatures. Docstrings on all public functions.
- TypeScript: Follow ESLint + Prettier config. Strict TypeScript mode.
- Commits: Conventional commit style preferred. Always include `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>`

### Logging
- Use structured logging everywhere (see `backend/common/logging.py`)
- Every log line must include: timestamp, level, module tag, message, and structured data dict
- Module tags: WEATHER, MODEL, MARKET, TRADING, ORDER, RISK, COOLDOWN, AUTH, SETTLE, POSTMORTEM, SYSTEM
- NEVER log sensitive data (API keys, private keys, passwords)
- Log at appropriate levels: DEBUG (dev only), INFO (normal ops), WARN (approaching limits), ERROR (failures), CRITICAL (system down)

### Monitoring (Prometheus Metrics)
- All Prometheus metric objects are centralized in `backend/common/metrics.py` — import from there
- HTTP metrics are collected automatically by `PrometheusMiddleware` in `backend/common/middleware.py`
- Celery task metrics are collected automatically via signals in `backend/celery_app.py`
- Business counters (trading cycles, trades executed, risk blocks, weather fetches) are incremented inline
- The `/metrics` endpoint exposes all metrics for Prometheus scraping
- Keep label cardinality bounded — normalize dynamic values (IDs, timestamps) before using as labels
- **Alert rules** in `monitoring/prometheus/rules/` — 18 rules across 6 groups (http, celery, trading, weather, targets, kalshi_ws)
- **Alertmanager** routes alerts by severity via webhook to `backend:8000/api/alerts`

### Interface Contracts
- All cross-module communication uses Pydantic models defined in `backend/common/schemas.py`
- Do NOT import directly from another agent's module — use the shared schemas
- If you need a new shared type, add it to `backend/common/schemas.py`

### Error Handling
- Never let exceptions crash the bot silently
- All API calls must have retry logic with exponential backoff
- Network failures should trigger WARN logs and graceful degradation, not crashes
- Trading-related errors must trigger alerts to the user (push notification or log)

## Key Domain Knowledge

### Kalshi Weather Markets
- 4 cities: NYC (Central Park), Chicago (Midway), Miami (MIA), Austin (AUS)
- 6 brackets per city per day (middle 4 are 2°F wide, top/bottom are catch-alls)
- Markets launch 10:00 AM ET the day before the event
- Settlement authority: Kalshi API (`/portfolio/settlements`) — win/loss from `market_result`; NWS CLI temps used for display only
- Measurement period: 12:00 AM - 11:59 PM LOCAL STANDARD TIME (not DST)
- Contract pays $1 if temp lands in bracket, $0 otherwise

### NWS API
- Base URL: https://api.weather.gov
- No auth needed, just set User-Agent header
- Be respectful of rate limits — no more than 1 request/second

### Open-Meteo API
- Base URL: https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/
- No auth needed
- Free for non-commercial use

### Kalshi API
- Docs: https://docs.kalshi.com
- Auth: RSA key pair (API Key ID + PEM private key)
- REST + WebSocket + FIX 4.4
- Rate limits vary by tier

## File Naming Conventions
- Python: snake_case for files and functions, PascalCase for classes
- TypeScript: camelCase for files, PascalCase for components
- Tests mirror source structure: `backend/weather/nws.py` → `tests/weather/test_nws.py`
- All test files prefixed with `test_`

## Deployment
- **Self-hosted:** `docker compose up -d` (see `README.md`)
- **Custom domain:** Create `docker-compose.override.yml` (git-ignored) to set `CORS_ORIGINS` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` for reverse proxy / tunnel deployments
- **Cloud:** Deploy guides in `docs/` for Railway, Fly.io, Oracle Cloud Free Tier
- **Config files:** `fly.toml` (backend), `fly.frontend.toml` (frontend), `railway.json` (Railway button)
- **Cloud override:** `docker-compose.cloud.yml` disables monitoring stack (replicas: 0)
- **Env generator:** `scripts/generate-env.sh` creates `.env` with random ENCRYPTION_KEY

## Environment Variables
- All config via `.env` file (see `.env.example`)
- Never commit `.env` — it's in `.gitignore`
- Required vars documented in `.env.example` with comments
