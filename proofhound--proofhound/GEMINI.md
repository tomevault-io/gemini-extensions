# ProofHound

The ProofHound open-source edition targets self-hosted scenarios, providing a single-workspace prompt lifecycle toolset: prompt versions, dataset regression testing, experiments, optimizations, canary releases, production releases, run results, annotations, and rollbacks.

The repository keeps thin abstractions such as `project_id`, `ProjectContext`, `ActorContext`, and `accessControl` for the local single-project data boundary and future external control plane integration; product documentation narrates around a single workspace by default and does not expand on a control plane feature list.

This repository carries only OSS self-hosted capabilities. Future SaaS / control plane capabilities are carried by a separate repository; this repository's architecture may leave clean, thin, currently usable interface hooks, but must not pre-embed modules, features, dependencies, or product entry points that are currently useless for the sake of SaaS.

`@proofhound/core` (backend) and `@proofhound/web-ui` (frontend) hold the isomorphic, deployment-agnostic logic; `apps/*` are thin shells that inject the OSS/SaaS adapter contracts — server via `ProofHoundServerModule.forRoot({ contracts })`, web via `<ProofHoundWebProvider contracts>`.

Common commands (pnpm@10 + turbo orchestration):

| Purpose                                                    | Command                                                             |

> First run: after `cp .env.example .env`, fill in `DATABASE_URL` / `REDIS_URL`; `MODEL_API_KEY_ENCRYPTION_KEY` (@proofhound/crypto encrypts/decrypts the API Key) is an application-managed secret, and its absence will cause startup / invocation failures.

### Git workflow

- Branch naming: `<type>/<kebab>` aligned with Conventional Commits (`feat/`, `fix/`, `docs/`, `refactor/`, `chore/`, …) — e.g. `refactor/contracts-forroot-override`.
- `master` is PR-only: no direct push (branch protection + `enforce_admins`). Squash-merge with a Conventional-Commit PR title so release-please categorizes it.
- The primary working directory stays on `master` by default. Unless explicitly told otherwise, do not check out a feature branch in the primary checkout — create a worktree (below) for any non-`master` development, so the primary tree always reflects `master`.
- Worktrees: the repo-root `worktrees/` directory is the designated home for branch-development worktrees. It is deliberately excluded from every root tool — `.gitignore` (`/worktrees/`), `.dockerignore` (`worktrees`), `pnpm-workspace.yaml` (`!worktrees/**`), and `.prettierignore` (`worktrees`) — so a nested checkout there is never tracked, copied into a Docker build context, treated as a pnpm workspace package, or rewritten by `pnpm format`. Always create worktrees under it, never elsewhere in the tree.
- Create with `mkdir -p worktrees && git worktree add worktrees/<name> -b <type>/<kebab> master` (a fresh `<type>/<kebab>` branch off `master`). Do not rely on tooling that forces a `worktree-` prefix or rewrites `/` to `+`; rename the branch to conform if it does.
- Local-only files or documents that are intentionally gitignored but useful across worktrees must be shared by relative symlink from the primary checkout instead of copied, so updates stay in one place and branch cleanup does not lose local state. This includes `.env`, `.env.local`, `.cloud.env`, `docs/notes/`, and similar local secrets / notes.
- `docs/` layout rule: repo-tracked documentation is limited to `docs/specs/` (the business SPEC source of truth); brand / media files (logo, demo video) live in the repo-root `assets/` (excluded from the Docker build context via `.dockerignore`). Everything written for development itself — temporary notes, reminders, dev-only references / runbooks, interim research, and plan / design drafts produced while building a feature (including skill-generated artifacts such as `docs/superpowers/`) — lives in the gitignored `docs/notes/` and is never committed; fold any durable conclusions into the relevant `docs/specs/` file instead.
- After creating a worktree, before working in it: (1) link local secrets / notes from the primary worktree so the new tree can boot and keep local docs available — e.g. `ln -s ../../.env worktrees/<name>/.env` and `mkdir -p worktrees/<name>/docs && ln -s ../../../docs/notes worktrees/<name>/docs/notes` when those sources exist; (2) build its own CodeGraph index with `cd worktrees/<name> && codegraph init -i` (`.codegraph` state is gitignored and per-worktree, so the index does not carry over).
- Keep the VS Code multi-root workspace in step with the live worktrees. The single workspace file lives at the main checkout's `.vscode/proofhound.code-workspace` (under the gitignored `.vscode/`, so it is per-machine and never committed; its `folders` paths are relative to `.vscode/`). When you **add** a worktree, append `{ "path": "../worktrees/<name>" }` to its `folders` array — create the file if it is missing, always keeping `{ "path": ".." }` (the main checkout) as the first entry, e.g. `{ "folders": [{ "path": ".." }, { "path": "../worktrees/<name>" }], "settings": {} }`. When you **remove** a worktree, delete the matching `folders` entry.

### Local SaaS validation before package release

When an OSS change must be verified in the SaaS repo before a formal npm release, keep the OSS/SaaS boundary intact by packing this worktree and letting SaaS consume the tarballs. Do not publish a throwaway npm version just for feedback, and do not ask SaaS to import files from this checkout.

From the OSS branch worktree:

```bash
OSS_PACK_DIR="$PWD/.npm_packages"
mkdir -p "$OSS_PACK_DIR"
pnpm build
pnpm packages:pack "$OSS_PACK_DIR"
pnpm packages:pack:check
```

Tarballs for SaaS validation must live under this OSS worktree's project-local `.npm_packages/` directory. Do not place them under `/tmp` or any other machine-global scratch directory; keeping them under the project makes the active tarball set visible and reproducible for the current worktree.

Then in the SaaS `worktrees/dev` checkout, temporarily point `pnpm.overrides` for the needed `@proofhound/*` packages at the generated `file:$OSS_PACK_DIR/proofhound-<package>-<version>.tgz` tarballs, run `pnpm install`, and execute the SaaS checks or manual flow being debugged.

If SaaS validation reveals a bug, fix it in the same OSS branch worktree, rerun the build/pack commands above, rerun `pnpm install` in SaaS, and test again. The SaaS `file:` overrides and resulting lockfile changes are local-only verification state and must not be committed. After the OSS PR merges and publishes the real package version, SaaS should remove the local overrides and use the normal registry bump.

## 4. OSS / SaaS Boundary

- The current repository prioritizes serving the complete, usable closed loop of the open-source self-hosted edition; any new architecture must be able to explain how it improves current OSS functionality, maintainability, or the local data boundary.
- Thin interfaces such as `project_id`, `ProjectContext`, `ActorContext`, `accessControl`, Provider interfaces, and API / MCP boundaries may be kept as future external SaaS control plane integration points; these interfaces must have an open-source default implementation that is genuinely used by current code paths. The full contract of the adapter extension points (`ProjectContextResolver` / `ActorContextResolver` / `McpAuthResolver` / `ConnectorContextResolver` / `TokenService` / `AccessControlService` / `LimiterKeyStrategy` / `RuntimeLimitsProvider` / `WorkflowAuthorizationHook`) is in [08 Adapter extension points](docs/specs/08-adapter-extension-points.md).
- SaaS-exclusive capabilities such as organization / member / role permissions, tenant billing, plan quotas, hosted login, approvals, auditing, platform monitoring, alerting, and multi-project control plane are not implemented in this repository, nor pre-embedded via hidden menus, edition flags, empty migrations, empty Services, empty UI, or unused dependencies.
- The integration assumption between future SaaS and OSS is to connect through stable API / MCP / Provider / deployment configuration, rather than maintaining a hosted-only branch, a commercial-edition toggle, or a dual-form product in the same repository.
- If an abstraction only serves future SaaS and has no genuine caller or default behavior in the current OSS, do not add it yet; when uncertain, ask ZiqiXiao first.

## 5. Open-Source Edition Hard Constraints

1. For business-semantic changes, change the SPEC before changing the code; the SPEC is the source of truth.
2. The open-source edition has only one local project as the data boundary. Keep the `project_id` on all in-project business resources, the `projectId` / `ProjectContext` in Service inputs, and the Repository's `project_id` filtering; do not expand these abstractions into control plane features.
3. User-facing strings use the canonical product terminology consistently (do not invent synonyms): prompt version / run results / canary release / production release / Local admin app / API Token / global MCP Token.
4. Prompt and dataset resources have `active` / `archived` existence states. Archiving removes them from new experiment / optimization / release creation paths without affecting existing runs. Permanent deletion is a separate dangerous action: run the deletion hook first, list affected resources in OSS, then cascade-delete affected experiments / optimizations and their owned descendants; deleting a prompt also stops running release lanes that depend on it. Experiments, optimizations, and releases may be permanently deleted as child resources without blocking on upstream prompt / dataset references.
5. A prompt version is frozen as soon as it is referenced, with a DB trigger as a backstop; do not bypass it. The freeze blocks editing the execution contract (body / variables / output schema / judgment rules / prompt language — SPEC [23](docs/specs/23-prompts.md) §2); to change a frozen version, copy it into a new one. The freeze does NOT block permanent deletion: deleting a referenced (frozen) version is allowed and runs the rule-4 impact-list + cascade flow scoped to that version (SPEC [23](docs/specs/23-prompts.md) §4.2), so "deleting a frozen version" is not a freeze-invariant violation.
6. A production release enters `running` as soon as it is submitted.
7. Run results are immutable once written; annotations are written to `ph_runs.annotations`.
8. Controllers only do parameter validation, authentication adaptation, and calling Service / workflow / queue; business logic lives in the Service.
9. DTOs use Zod `z.infer`, shared between frontend and backend.
10. Application logs are written only as stdout JSON; LLM invocations must record the complete inputs and responses before writing run results.
11. Rate limiting goes through Redis centralized counting; do not maintain quotas locally in-process.
12. PostgreSQL-first; do not depend on managed-platform proprietary SQL extensions.
13. Adding / modifying user-facing strings on the frontend goes through `packages/web-ui/src/i18n` (`@proofhound/web-ui`), keeping `zh-CN` / `en-US` in sync.
14. Frontend date-time is uniformly `YYYY/MM/DD HH:mm:ss`.
15. Frontend theme colors use semantic tokens; do not hardcode single-theme colors.
16. Every Service method that can be invoked by the frontend exposes a corresponding MCP tool in `packages/core/src/server/channels/mcp/`; UI internal state is exempt.
17. Do not start local development services (web / server / worker / database / Redis, etc.) on your own; when you need integration or verification, first check the relevant existing services, and if they are already running use them directly, otherwise ask the user to start them before continuing. Exception: when the user explicitly asks to run `pnpm test:e2e` / Playwright e2e, the test command may start its configured isolated e2e services (for example server / webhook / worker / web / fake LLM) and shut them down as part of the test run.

## 6. Definition of Done

- Business code is complete and the local main path runs.
- Unit tests cover Service / DBOS step / BullMQ handler / pure strategy functions.
- Frontend changes add a Playwright smoke when necessary.
- Frontend copy is synced across the Chinese and English i18n.
- DB schema changes go through a Drizzle migration, not manual `psql` edits to the database.
- Business semantics are synced to the SPEC.
- `pnpm verify` is green, or the delivery notes clearly state which items were not run and why.

## 7. Skill Routing

| Task                       | SKILL                           |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Unsure where to start      | `proofhound-overview`           |
| NestJS Module              | `proofhound-backend-module`     |
| DBOS / BullMQ / runner     | `proofhound-dbos-workflow`      |
| LLM invocation             | `proofhound-llm-invocation`     |
| DB schema / migration      | `proofhound-database-migration` |
| Refine / frontend resource | `proofhound-frontend-resource`  |

## 8. What Not to Do

- Do not turn future control plane integration hooks into a same-repository branch or an open-source-edition business module.
- Do not pre-embed for future SaaS any edition flag, plan check, tenant UI, control plane route, empty table, empty Service, or unused dependency that the current OSS does not use.
- Do not remove the `project_id` data boundary.
- Do not write data directly to the database from the frontend; all writes go through the server.
- Do not reuse any entry token (user token / webhook token) with an external JWT; tokens are managed by the application layer.
- Do not let the user token and webhook token reuse the same scope / the same resolver; the user token (`scope='user'`) shares the HTTP API + MCP entries, the webhook token (`scope='webhook'`) is used only for inbound traffic of the corresponding connector, and the two credential systems are mutually independent.
- Do not truncate messages / response.content in LLM invocation logs unless they exceed the hard limit.
