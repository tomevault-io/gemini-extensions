# Discord MCP Platform — Claude Project Instructions

## Project Identity

Project name: `discord-mcp-platform`

Working description:

> A multi-server Discord MCP control plane that allows users to connect their Discord identity, install/configure Discord bots, and manage Discord server automation through MCP-compatible AI clients.

This project is a **Discord MCP** because it exposes Discord operations as Model Context Protocol tools, resources, and prompts.

The product must use official Discord bot and OAuth2/application flows.

## Core Framing

Users do not connect their Discord account so the system can control the account.

Users connect their Discord account so the platform can:

- identify them;
- discover relevant guild context when permitted;
- verify whether they should be allowed to manage a guild;
- connect them to workspaces;
- authorize bot installation/configuration flows;
- audit actions performed through MCP clients.

Actual Discord automation must be executed through authorized Discord bot accounts or official webhooks.

## Strict Non-Goals

Do not implement self-bot behavior.

Do not use Discord user tokens.

Do not ask a user to paste their Discord token.

Do not automate a normal Discord user account.

Do not send messages as a personal Discord user.

Do not read user DMs by imitating a user.

Do not use browser automation to control Discord.

Do not bypass Discord permissions, rate limits, OAuth scopes, gateway restrictions, or API limits.

Do not build spam, raid, mass-DM, invite-spam, reaction-spam, or stealth-monitoring tools.

## Product Goal

Build a platform where a user can say, through an MCP-capable AI client:

- "Create a support channel in my server."
- "Summarize the last 100 messages in #general."
- "Create a moderation bot for #support."
- "Post this announcement in #updates."
- "Create a private incident thread and invite moderators."
- "Create an automation that answers FAQs and escalates unresolved questions."
- "List users with the Trial Member role."
- "Draft a moderation warning for this message."

The AI client should call MCP tools, and the platform should safely execute those operations through a Discord bot after permission checks.

## Architecture Style

Use a layered architecture.

## Technical Stack

Use Python as the main implementation language.

Preferred stack:

- Python 3.12+
- uv
- FastAPI
- MCP Python SDK
- pydantic v2
- discord.py or nextcord
- httpx (Discord REST client)
- SQLAlchemy 2.x
- Alembic
- PostgreSQL
- Redis
- pytest
- ruff
- mypy
- Docker
- Docker Compose

For the dashboard, use a separate frontend later. Recommended frontend stack:

- Vue 3
- Vite
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Pinia
- TanStack Query or equivalent

Do not build the dashboard in the first backend MVP unless explicitly requested.

## MCP Design

The MCP server must expose Discord capabilities as:

- tools: actions and queries the model can call;
- resources: addressable Discord/platform objects;
- prompts: reusable workflows for Discord operations.

The MCP server should support:

1. local STDIO mode for local development;
2. Streamable HTTP mode for hosted/remote usage.

HTTP transport should be the production target.

## Product Modes

### Mode A — Hosted Platform Bot

The user logs into the platform and installs the official platform bot into their server.

This is the MVP mode.

Benefits:

- easiest onboarding;
- single Discord app to manage;
- simpler security;
- simpler compliance;
- easier SaaS deployment.

### Mode B — Bring Your Own Bot

The user creates their own Discord application/bot, then connects bot credentials to the platform.

This is a later advanced mode.

Benefits:

- custom bot identity;
- better for enterprise/private communities;
- user owns Discord app;
- stronger branding control.

Risks:

- secret-management complexity;
- harder setup;
- support burden.

### Mode C — Self-hosted Runtime

The user runs the entire MCP platform in their own infrastructure.

This is a later enterprise/open-source mode.

## Authorization Model

Every request must pass multiple gates:

```text
MCP client auth
  -> platform user/session auth
  -> workspace membership check
  -> guild installation check
  -> platform role/permission check
  -> channel policy check
  -> Discord bot permission check
  -> rate-limit check
  -> execution
  -> audit log
```

Discord permissions answer:

> Can the bot do this?

Platform permissions answer:

> Should this user be allowed to make the bot do this?

Both must pass.

## Suggested Platform Roles

- owner
- admin
- operator
- moderator
- analyst
- viewer

## Suggested Permission Flags

- `workspace:manage`
- `guild:read`
- `guild:manage`
- `channel:read`
- `channel:write`
- `message:read`
- `message:write`
- `thread:read`
- `thread:write`
- `role:read`
- `role:write`
- `member:read`
- `moderation:write`
- `automation:read`
- `automation:write`
- `mcp_client:manage`
- `audit:read`

## Safety Rules for Tools

Every MCP tool must:

1. accept typed pydantic input;
2. return typed pydantic output;
3. validate Discord snowflakes as strings;
4. resolve authenticated principal;
5. check workspace/guild/channel permission;
6. check Discord bot permission;
7. respect Discord rate limits;
8. support dry-run where the operation changes state;
9. audit state-changing operations;
10. avoid leaking tokens or secrets;
11. return clear errors without internal stack traces.

## Dangerous Operation Policy

The following operations require dry-run and/or explicit confirmation:

- deleting messages;
- bulk deleting messages;
- changing channel permissions;
- assigning roles;
- removing roles;
- timing out members;
- banning members;
- kicking members;
- deleting channels;
- creating webhooks;
- changing automation behavior;
- enabling broad channel access;
- posting to announcement channels;
- mass notifications.

Default state for risky actions: dry-run.

## First MVP

The MVP is built. It includes:

1. FastAPI API.
2. Health endpoint.
3. Settings loading.
4. Discord OAuth login skeleton.
5. Hosted bot configuration.
6. Guild installation model.
7. MCP server (66 tools, HTTP and STDIO transport).
8. MCP client token model.
9. Conversational AI agent (~60 tools, responds to @mentions).
10. Discord Gateway WebSocket with slash commands.
11. Permission service with scope-based checking.
12. Audit logging with PII redaction.
13. Docker Compose with API, PostgreSQL, Redis.
14. 17 test files with mocked Discord client.

## Coding Standards

- Keep files small.
- Prefer explicit service classes.
- Use dependency injection where reasonable.
- Avoid business logic inside route handlers.
- Avoid business logic inside MCP tool handlers.
- Use typed exceptions.
- Use structured logging.
- Use UTC timestamps.
- Use string IDs for Discord snowflakes.
- Use migrations for database schema changes.

Versioned docs live in `docs/`:

- `MCP_TOOLS.md` — every MCP tool, its REST endpoint, scopes, dry-run and
  dangerous-op status (regenerate reference: read `mcp/tools/*.py`)
- `SECURITY_POLICY.md` — non-goals, authorization model, dangerous
  operation policy

Spec coverage lives in `specs/`:

- `specs/openapi.json` — vendored official Discord OpenAPI spec
  (refresh: `scripts/fetch-discord-spec.sh`; o Hermes tem um job
  agendado de sincronizacao semanal)
- `specs/COVERAGE.md` — generated spec-vs-REST-vs-MCP report
  (`scripts/coverage_report.py`, `--check` enforces the baseline)

Root-level docs: `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`.

Spec source of truth: `specs/openapi.json` (vendored official Discord OpenAPI spec). Coverage
report: `specs/COVERAGE.md`, generated by `scripts/coverage_report.py` (fetch the spec with
`scripts/fetch-discord-spec.sh`; `--check` guards against regressions via
`specs/.coverage-baseline`).

## Definition of Done

```bash
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up --build
```

```bash
make test
```

Tests do not require a real Discord token.
