# Nakafa Codebase Agent Guide

Build for longevity.
Favor readable, skimmable, well-verified code over speed or cleverness.

## Source Of Truth

- Use retrieval-led reasoning first. Read the repo, configs, docs, and generated files before changing code.
- No Cursor rules were found in `.cursor/rules/` or `.cursorrules` when this guide was updated.
- No Copilot instructions were found in `.github/copilot-instructions.md` when this guide was updated.
- This root `AGENTS.md` is the baseline for the repo.
- Also read any nested `AGENTS.md` files in the area you touch.
- For Convex work, `packages/backend/AGENTS.md` is mandatory.
- For Convex work, read `packages/backend/convex/_generated/ai/guidelines.md` before making changes.
- For structural work, skim recent `git log` first so you do not reintroduce old patterns.
- Verify behavior from actual code and docs, not memory.

- `pnpm dev:web` - run the main web app and Convex backend through Turbo
- `pnpm dev:all` - run all workspace `dev` tasks through Turbo
- `pnpm build` - build all packages and apps
- `pnpm test` - run all workspace tests
- `pnpm test:watch` - run watch-mode tests where supported
- `pnpm test:ui` - open Vitest UI where supported

## Focused Commands

- `pnpm --filter www dev` - Next.js app on `3000`
- `pnpm --filter api dev` - Next.js API app on `3002`
- `pnpm --filter mcp dev` - MCP app on `3001`
- `pnpm --filter email dev` - React Email preview on `3004`
- `pnpm --filter @repo/backend dev` - Convex dev with tailed logs
- `pnpm dev` / `pnpm dev:web` - recommended day-to-day combo for `www` + Convex backend
- `pnpm dev:all` - use when you truly need every app running together
- There is no single root `typecheck` script; run it in the workspace you changed.
- `pnpm --filter www typecheck`
- `pnpm --filter api typecheck`
- `pnpm --filter @repo/backend typecheck`
- `pnpm --filter @repo/design-system typecheck`
- Preferred single-test pattern: `pnpm --filter <workspace> exec vitest run <relative-test-path>`
- `pnpm --filter www exec vitest run __tests__/pages.test.tsx`
- `pnpm --filter api exec vitest run lib/__tests__/proxy.test.ts`
- `pnpm --filter @repo/backend exec vitest run helpers/chunk.test.ts`
- `pnpm --filter @repo/contents exec vitest run _lib/__tests__/content.test.ts`
- Add `-t "test name"` to run one named test.
- Use `pnpm --filter <workspace> test` for the whole workspace suite.
- Convex helpers: `pnpm --filter @repo/backend setup`, `seed`, `deploy`, `insights`

## Workflow Expectations

- Read the touched package's `package.json`, config files, and nearby code before editing.
- Follow existing local patterns before inventing new abstractions.
- Keep changes cohesive across frontend, Convex backend, and dev/prod behavior.
- Avoid disconnected patches, workaround code, wrapper chains, and legacy leftovers.
- Prefer small, direct helpers over abstraction layers.
- Use early returns to keep logic flat and skimmable.
- Run the smallest useful verification set after changes, then expand if risk is high.

## Formatting And Imports

- Formatting is owned by Biome through Ultracite. Run `pnpm format` instead of hand-formatting.
- Use spaces for indentation.
- Use double quotes for strings and JSX attributes.
- Prefer `import type` for type-only imports.
- Within apps, prefer `@/` imports over long relative paths.
- Across workspaces, use `@repo/*` imports.
- Prefer direct file imports over adding new barrel layers unless the existing API already exposes one.
- Group imports clearly: external, workspace, then app-local.
- Respect existing file naming in the touched area; naming-convention lint rules are intentionally relaxed.

## TypeScript Rules

- TypeScript is strict across the repo.
- Prefer derived and inferred types over manual annotations.
- Do not add redundant type annotations just to restate what TypeScript already knows.
- If inference breaks, fix the source design instead of forcing the type system.
- Avoid `any`; use `unknown` only when something is truly unknown and narrow it quickly.
- Avoid type assertions and workaround casts whenever possible.
- Keep public function inputs and outputs obvious.
- Use meaningful names instead of magic values or anonymous tuple-like objects.

## Effect Rules

- Use Effect for effectful TypeScript business logic, especially in `packages/ai`.
- Model expected failures with `Schema.TaggedError` and specific domain error names.
- Prefer `Effect.fn("scope.name")` for effectful exported functions and service methods so traces are named.
- Use `Effect.Service` with declared dependencies for business services; reserve `Context.Tag` for runtime-injected infrastructure boundaries.
- Use `Effect.try`, `Effect.tryPromise`, `Effect.acquireRelease`, and `Effect.sync` instead of raw `try/catch`, raw async wrappers, or hidden side effects.
- Handle known errors with `catchTag` or `catchTags`; avoid `catchAll` unless preserving the full cause at an outer boundary.
- Use `Option.match`, `Option.getOrElse`, or explicit early returns instead of `Option.getOrThrow`.
- Use `Config.*` for application configuration. Direct `process.env` access is allowed only in dedicated env-schema boundary modules.
- Use `Effect.log` or the repo logger for production logs; do not use `console.log`.
- Keep Effect code readable: flat generator flow, early returns for pure branches, no clever pipelines when a named step is clearer.

## Readability And Errors

- Optimize for code that is easy to skim.
- Prefer obvious control flow over clever one-liners.
- Keep functions focused and narrow in responsibility.
- Extract repeated logic only when it improves readability or reuse.
- Do not introduce wrapper functions around other functions without a clear benefit.
- Do not leave redundant branches, temporary code, or commented-out code behind.
- Throw real `Error` objects or framework-appropriate errors such as `ConvexError`.
- Use descriptive error messages and handle edge cases deliberately.
- Do not catch errors just to rethrow the same thing.
- Remove `console.log`, `debugger`, and `alert` from production code.

## React And Next.js

<!-- BEGIN:nextjs-agent-rules -->
 
### Next.js: ALWAYS read docs before coding
 
Before any Next.js work, find and read the relevant doc in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/`. Your training data is outdated — the docs are the source of truth.
 
<!-- END:nextjs-agent-rules -->

- Follow existing Next.js and React 19 conventions already present in the repo.
- Use function components.
- Add `"use client"` only when the component truly needs client-side features.
- Keep hooks at the top level and satisfy dependency arrays.
- Prefer deriving values over adding extra effects.
- Check Mantine Hooks before writing a new custom hook from scratch.
- Use semantic HTML and accessible component APIs.
- Prefer Next.js primitives like `<Image>` when appropriate.
- Keep server/client boundaries explicit and minimal.

## Convex Rules

- Follow official Convex docs and the generated AI guidelines exactly.
- Use shared helpers and validators in `packages/backend/convex/lib/`.
- Use auth helpers from `packages/backend/convex/lib/helpers/auth.ts`; do not reach for raw `ctx.auth` patterns first.
- Add validators for every Convex function.
- Use `query`, `mutation`, `action`, and internal variants appropriately; do not expose sensitive logic publicly.
- Prefer installed helpers/components when they fit: Better Auth, Workflow, Aggregate, Workpool, `convex-helpers`.
- Keep pagination, relationships, aggregates, workflows, and cron jobs aligned with official patterns.
- Make Convex schema and index names explicit and readable.

## Testing Rules

- Vitest is the standard test runner.
- Existing tests live in `__tests__/`, `__test__/`, and `*.test.ts(x)` files.
- Use `describe`, `it`/`test`, and focused assertions.
- Keep tests readable and behavior-oriented.
- Do not leave `.only` or `.skip` in committed code.
- When changing business logic, add or update the nearest relevant test.
- After risky changes, run the affected workspace suite, not just one file.

## MDX And Content Rules

- Content is primarily Indonesian unless context requires English.
- Subject lesson headings start at `h2`; keep lesson depth at `h3`.
- Exercise answer MDX is rendered under the app-provided `h3` answer heading, so answer sections start at `h4` and may use `h5` for real nested analysis.
- Use inline code for programming syntax.
- Use `InlineMath` and `BlockMath` for math, not plain text math.
- Use `MathContainer` around consecutive math blocks when needed.
- `NumberLine` and `LineEquation` require explicit imports from the design system.
- Keep list formatting simple with hyphen bullets.
- Leave blank lines between prose paragraphs and math blocks.

## Git And Final Verification

- Never overwrite or revert user changes you did not make.
- Never use destructive git commands unless explicitly asked.
- Never commit unless the user explicitly asks for a commit.
- Before structural changes, read recent history so your approach matches the repo's direction.
- Format changed files.
- Run `pnpm lint` when the change is ready.
- Run targeted tests and the relevant workspace `typecheck`.
- If the change touches build-critical paths, run `pnpm build` or the affected workspace build.
- Mention any verification you could not run.
