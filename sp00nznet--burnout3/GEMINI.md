# Burnout 3: Takedown - Static Recompilation Project

## Project Overview
Static recompilation of Xbox Burnout 3: Takedown (2004) for Windows 11.
The goal is to translate the original x86 Xbox code into a native Windows executable.

## Key Facts
- **XBE**: `default.xbe` is a retail Xbox executable, XDK 5849, base address 0x00010000
- **Entry Point**: 0x001D2807 (retail, XOR-decoded with 0xA8FC57AB)
- **Engine**: Criterion's custom RenderWare fork (~3.7), statically linked
- **Code Size**: 2.73 MB in .text section (game + CRT + RW engine)
- **Kernel Imports**: 147 Xbox kernel functions to replace with Win32
- **Libraries**: 11 statically linked XDK libs (D3D8LTCG, DSOUND, XMV, XONLINE, etc.)

## Repository Structure
- `docs/` - Detailed analysis and documentation
- `tools/xbe_parser/` - XBE file parser (Python)
- `tools/disasm/` - Disassembly tools (planned)
- `tools/asset_tools/` - Asset conversion (planned)
- `src/kernel/` - Xbox kernel replacement layer (Win32)
- `src/d3d/` - D3D8→D3D11 graphics abstraction
- `src/audio/` - Audio system (DSOUND→XAudio2)
- `src/input/` - Input system (XPP→XInput)
- `src/game/` - Decompiled game code

## Git/GitHub
- Remote: https://github.com/sp00nznet/burnout3.git
- Game assets (`Burnout 3 Takedown/`) are gitignored (large binary files)
- All toolchain code and documentation IS committed

## Conventions
- Python tools use Python 3.10+
- C/C++ code targets MSVC (Visual Studio 2022) or MinGW-w64
- Addresses are always shown as hex with 0x prefix (e.g., 0x001D2807)
- Xbox kernel function names use their original Xbox names with `xbox_` prefix when reimplemented

## Current Work State (Session 43)

### Status: PLAYABLE — driving on real track geometry at 32fps
Game boots to menus, R key launches race, player drives on real Burnout 3 track geometry rendered through recompiled gen code pipeline. Gen code render chain (sub_00351490→sub_00351770_gen→sub_00350C10) active. Gameplay state machine transitions 5→4→5 working. Track geometry drawn via D3D8 DrawPrimitiveUP with pre-transformed vertices. Chase camera follows physics body. Pre-race cinematic plays (flyover camera cuts). 6000 verts/frame, 7 batched draws, 32fps.

### Session 43 Changes (2026-03-20)
- **Gen code render chain un-stubbed**: sub_00351490 (begin camera), sub_00351770_gen (62K scene render), sub_00350C10 (end camera) all running
- **D3D8LTCG device context fully fixed**:
  - GPU read pointer trick: device+0x30 → device+0x2C (eliminates PB spin loops)
  - PB ring management: +0x24/+0x28/+0x2C/+0x30/+0x34/+0x38/+0x44/+0x48 all patched post-snapshot
  - RT surfaces at +0x1974/+0x1978 initialized non-NULL
  - Camera active flag (device+8 bit 14) forced per-frame
- **24 D3D8LTCG stubs fixed**: Proper Xbox stack cleanup calling conventions (esp += 4/8/12)
- **Gameplay state machine**: R key launches race via fe_start_race()
  - State transitions: menu(5) → race init(4) → gameplay(5)
  - Phase state machine (sub_001AA100): phases 1→3→4→5→6→7→9→0x13
  - Phase 9 timeout after 30 tries (render list builder can't complete without RW track loading)
  - g_race_init_done signal prevents state oscillation
- **Track geometry rendering**: Direct D3D8 DrawPrimitiveUP with batched pre-transformed vertices
  - 6000 verts/frame from 49 track chunks, 7 draw calls
  - View-projection transform, distance culling (500 unit radius)
  - Triangle strip → triangle list conversion
- **Chase camera**: Physics body-based fallback with 75° FOV, heading-relative positioning
- **Float ICALL guard**: Rejects IEEE 754 values (exponent 50-200) as vtable entries
- **Input system**: fe_menu_is_racing() fallback for gameplay detection
- **Race launch flow**: R key → fe_start_race → state=4 → phase 1-9 → timeout → state=5 → gameplay
- **g_force_respawn**: Resets physics init flag when launching race (prevents boot-time flag blocking)
- **D3D8LTCG device context reference doc**: `docs/d3d8ltcg_device_context.md` (reusable)
- **Log noise reduced**: Mirror failures (3+50K), SKIP-READ (10+100K)

### Session 42 Changes (2026-03-17)
- **Live render pipeline investigation**: Attempted to enable original sub_001AE6F0 call chain
  - sub_0003FEE0 (RW state setup) crashes on uninitialized D3D device context fields
  - Even with D3D8LTCG mid-entry stubs, gen code walks pointer chains through device+0xCA0+
  - sub_001AD350 (render list dispatch) returns immediately: render entry table res[+24]=NULL
  - Render entry table populated by sub_0003FEE0 chain → circular dependency
- **D3D8LTCG mid-entry stubs added** (recomp_manual.c):
  - sub_0034F5B0 (70K render state flush) — stubbed, returns current PB position
  - sub_003558A0 (45K render state flush) — stubbed, returns current PB position
  - sub_0034D410 (79K render state flush) — stubbed, returns current PB position
  - These are all entry points into the same giant D3D8LTCG function (ends at 0x360A54)
- **D3D device context snapshot captured from xemu** (`src/nv2a/d3d_device_snapshot.h`):
  - Device is STATIC at 0x0035D6A0 (in D3D8LTCG section), NOT heap-allocated
  - 16KB snapshot captured during menu rendering (game state 5, cam=0x4D4008)
  - Loaded at boot via memcpy, with PB/surface/viewport fixups
  - Capture script: `tools/xemu_debug/capture_d3d_device.py`
- **Key findings**:
  - Render list resource at 0x01C7D000: res[+08]=native ptr, res[+24]=NULL (entry table)
  - sub_0003FEE0 STILL crashes even with snapshot — 16KB contains hundreds of xemu
    heap pointers (0x0078xxxx etc.) that can't be trivially fixed up
  - Screen entries exist (1736 at 0x4B01B0) but never processed for rendering
  - sub_0003FEE0 calls: sub_0034F5B0, sub_003518E0, sub_003558A0, sub_0003FE10,
    sub_0034D410, sub_00040CF0 — gen code walks deep pointer chains in device state
- **Manual sub_0003FEE0 override** (recomp_manual.c):
  - Performs safe matrix copies (game_obj+0x500→+0x6E0, device+0xCA0→game_obj+0x540)
  - Calls sub_0034C2E0 (D3D clear) and sub_001AD350 ×3 (render dispatch)
  - Skips D3D8LTCG state flush (sub_0034F5B0/sub_003558A0/sub_0034D410)
  - Skips sub_00040CF0 (walks device pointer chains)
  - **Restored 60fps** (was 32fps with direct D3D clear in sub_001AE6F0)
  - Gen code disabled in recomp_0000.c (#if 0)

### Session 40 Changes (2026-03-15)
- **NV2A PGRAPH → D3D11 translator** (`src/nv2a/nv2a_pgraph_d3d11.c/h`): New reusable module
  - Intercepts NV2A Kelvin method calls from push buffer parser
  - Handles: SET_BEGIN_END, INLINE_ARRAY, CLEAR_SURFACE, blend/depth/cull state, viewport
  - Converts 5-dword inline vertices (X,Y,U,V,Color) to 28-byte XYZRHW+Diffuse+TEX1
  - QUADS (mode 8) → triangle list conversion (6 verts per quad)
  - Routes through D3D8 COM `DrawPrimitiveUP` → D3D11
  - 24 draw calls/frame, 1079 vertices, correct Burnout 3 menu layout
- **Push buffer replay** (`src/nv2a/nv2a_pb_replay.c`): Replays captured xemu data
  - 32KB push buffer captured from xemu during menu rendering
  - 268 NV2A command headers parsed, 6471 methods/frame dispatched
  - Auto-activates after 60 frames for testing
- **xemu debug session**: Comprehensive menu state capture
  - Screen list vtable = 0x003A9FA4 (10 methods, all in gen code, NOT stubbed)
  - 536 screen entries at 0x004B01B0, flag=2 (active)
  - Frontend vtable at 0x003A9E7C confirmed, [3]=0x00014D20
  - Render context at 0x35FB48 → NV2A push buffer DMA state
  - sub_001AE6F0 NOT called during menus (wrong assumption corrected)
  - Real chain: sub_00014D20 → sub_0034C2E0 + sub_0034D530 from RW pipeline
  - Menu rendering uses INLINE_ARRAY with TRIANGLE_STRIP/QUADS, no im2d
- **pgraph_method() updated**: Routes through D3D11 translator before legacy logging
- **Bridge render path**: When replay active, clears to dark blue + draws replay geometry
- **Captured push buffer data**: `src/nv2a/menu_pushbuffer_data.h` (embedded C array)

### Session 40 Key Discovery: Menu Render Pipeline
The original menu rendering does NOT use im2d or sub_001AE6F0. Instead:
1. `sub_000171A0` → vtable[3] → `sub_00014D20` (per frame, calls sub_0034C2E0 for D3D clear)
2. RW display pipeline → `sub_0034D530` (79K D3D8LTCG, writes NV2A push buffer commands)
3. Push buffer contains: BEGIN_END(TRIANGLE_STRIP/QUADS) + INLINE_ARRAY vertex data
4. Vertex format: float X, float Y, float U, float V, D3DCOLOR (20 bytes, 640×480 screen space)
5. ~448 vertices/frame in ~25 draw batches = textured 2D quads for all menu UI elements

### Session 39 Changes (2026-03-13)
- **sub_001AA100 REWRITTEN**: Full phase state machine (phases 1-9 → 0x13) instead of simple 30-frame skip
  - Phase 1: sub_001B5A80 (scene init)
  - Phase 3: sub_0018B250 (resource check)
  - Phase 4: sub_0013EA20 (audio init, timeout after 5 tries)
  - Phase 5: Scene descriptor sanitization (garbage count fix)
  - Phase 6: B790/B794 screen definition check (already populated at 0x0045BAD0)
  - Phase 7: sub_0018E820 + sub_001888F0
  - Phase 9: sub_0019AE10 (render list builder) — successfully creates resource at 0x01C7D000
- **sub_001AE6F0 overridden**: Frontend render dispatch, currently D3D clear + diagnostics
  - Original calls sub_001AD350 (render list dispatch) → sub_0034D530 (79K render) → im2d
  - Both disabled due to native pointer issues
- **Screen list garbage data IDENTIFIED AND FIXED**:
  - Screen list sub-object at 0x004AF590 had 0x3F800000 (1.0f) in count/index fields
  - sub_001AED70 (find-free-slot) was scanning from index 1065353216, writing entries beyond array
  - PATCH: Zero count and index fields before sub_0001F7C0 screen registration
- **Screen entry invalidation DISABLED** (gen patches):
  - sub_001AEE20 (recomp_0004.c): vtable guard changed to keep entries active, not invalidate
  - sub_0001F7C0 (recomp_0000.c): 19 invalidation blocks commented out (all had NULL vtable → eax=0 → decrement)
  - Screen entries now persist with flag=1 (active) instead of being immediately cleared
- **Screen list vtable = NULL**: Root cause is C++ constructor never ran for screen list sub-object
  - Object at ebp+0x83E0 (0x004AF580 with Xbox base 0x004A71A0) initialized with data but no vtable
  - RECOMP_ICALL_SAFE(0) returns eax=0, causing validation failure
  - All 3 vtable methods (offsets +0, +8, +0xC) read MEM32(0+offset) = 0 → lookup fails
- **recomp_0004.c gen patches**: sub_001AE6F0 `#if 0`, sub_001AEE20 vtable guard fix
- **recomp_0000.c gen patches**: Screen list init PATCH, 19× invalidation disable, screen array trace

### Session 38 Changes
- **Im2d rendering pipeline WORKING**: RwIm2DRenderPrimitive (sub_001DE900) overridden
  - Routes pre-transformed 2D vertices through rw_bridge_im2d_render() → D3D8→D3D11
  - Driver entry 0x0F (sub_001DBDE0) also overridden as safety net
  - Auto BeginScene/EndScene management for im2d calls outside 3D render pass
  - Debug HUD overlay: top bar = game state color, bottom bar = pulsing im2d active indicator
- **Im2d callback table populated**: MEM32(0x7592CC) = 0x1E2930 (render triangle), 0x7592D0 = 0x1E2330 (render line)
- **VEH divide-by-zero handler**: Catches EXCEPTION_INT_DIVIDE_BY_ZERO, decodes x86-64 idiv instruction, sets EAX/EDX=0, skips past. Prevents SEH unwinding game loop.
- **Game audio events connected**: AWD sounds trigger on state machine transitions
  - State 7→4: "Zoom" sound, State 4→5: "MenuIn" sound, Boot: "GlobeHigh" chime
  - Audio played through APU software mixer (waveOut 48kHz)
- **recomp_0005.c**: `#if 0` around gen sub_001DBDE0, sub_001DE900

### Session 37 Changes
- **sub_001AA100 overridden** in recomp_manual.c: forces return 1 after 30 frames
  - Enables state 4→5 transition in outer state machine (sub_000165F0)
- **Frontend render path activated**: sub_000171A0 now fires every frame
  - Frontend obj at 0x4D4008, vtable at 0x1C45BA68 (native ptr, not Xbox VA)
- **recomp_0004.c**: `#if 0` around gen sub_001AA100

### Previous Status
Game boots, loads, runs gameplay loop. **Two rendering modes** toggled with V key:
1. **Pseudo-3D** (default): OutRun-style 2.5D rendering (unchanged from Session 21)
2. **True 3D** (V key): Full 3D world-space rendering with chase camera, time-of-day cycling, roadside scenery, tunnels, night stars, rain weather, and 3D vehicle models.

### Session 31: xemu Live Debugging (NEW)
- **xemu GDB stub analysis**: Connected to running game via GDB RSP on port 1234
- **Game state machine discovered**: 0x4D53B8 values: 5=menus AND regular racing, 4=crash mode only, 7=loading
- **Camera pointer as gameplay indicator**: 0x4D5370 == 0x4D45D0 means gameplay (any mode), 0x4D4008 means menus

### Session 30 Progress
- Created **xboxrecomp** toolkit repo (https://github.com/sp00nznet/xboxrecomp)
  - 4 toolchain modules (xbe_parser, disasm, func_id, recomp)
  - 6 pipeline guides, 8 technical deep dives, 3 format references
  - 3 runtime templates (recomp_types.h, xbox_memory.h, kernel_stubs.h)
  - 15,196 lines across 55 files

### Next Steps
1. **Capture push buffers for sub-menus** from xemu (SINGLE EVENT, OPTIONS, etc.) and
   drive PB replay from game's menu selection state for interactive menu navigation
2. **Un-stub sub_0034CBF0** — write manual override to set render state dirty flags
   (surface+0x80000, device+0x1A04/1A08 swap) without D3D pointer chain walks,
   enabling sub_0034D530_gen to flush actual vertex data
3. Decode .btv vehicle texture format and apply to 3D models
4. Long-term: fix the real physics world initialization

### Key Input Addresses
- Accumulators: 0x4D652C (throttle), 0x4D6530 (steering) - written by game_frame_pump()
- Car object: 0x557880 (esi in sub_000636D0), +0x1B4 → velocity ptr (= 0x5FFF00)
- Boost button: 0x5FFD0C (from VK_SHIFT or gamepad A/RB in game_frame_pump)
- Button events: 0x4A1C74-0x4A1C79 (processed by sub_00013F10)

### Controls
- **Keyboard**: WASD = drive, Shift = boost, ESC = quit
- **V key**: toggle true 3D rendering mode (chase camera)
- **T key**: cycle through 37 tracks (loads track geometry in 3D mode)
- **M key**: toggle 3D model viewer (turntable view)
- **N/P keys**: next/previous vehicle model (in model viewer)
- **Gamepad**: Left stick = steer, RT/LT = gas/brake, A or RB = boost
