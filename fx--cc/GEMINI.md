# fx/cc Marketplace Development Guidelines

This document outlines principles and conventions for developing plugins in the fx/cc Claude Code marketplace.

## Instruction Files

This repo uses the standard layout that `fx-dev:setup` scaffolds — two canonical files, everything else a pointer:

| Path | Role |
|------|------|
| `AGENTS.md` | **This file.** Project conventions: how code is written. Read natively by Codex, Copilot, and CodeRabbit |
| `REVIEW.md` | Review conventions: what reviewers should and should not flag. Read natively by Copilot code review |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Pointer — a single `@AGENTS.md` import, because Claude Code does not read `AGENTS.md` |
| `.coderabbit.yaml` | Lists `**/REVIEW.md`, which is not in CodeRabbit's default patterns |

Put a rule about **writing** code here. Put a rule about **reviewing** code in `REVIEW.md`. Never edit `CLAUDE.md` to add content — edit `AGENTS.md`, which it imports.

There is deliberately **no** `.github/copilot-instructions.md`: Copilot code review reads `REVIEW.md` directly ([changelog, 2026-07-17](https://github.blog/changelog/2026-07-17-copilot-code-review-customization-and-configurability-improvements/)), so a second copy would only drift.

The full standard, including the migration path for other repos, is in `plugins/fx-dev/skills/setup/references/instruction-files.md`.

## Code Review Rules

Read `REVIEW.md` at the repository root and apply it in full as the review rules for this repo. It is the canonical review-conventions file.

## Required First-Time Setup (READ THIS FIRST)

**MANDATORY before any commit in this repo.** Git does not allow a checked-in file to wire up hooks automatically (security feature), so every clone of this repo — including `~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/fx-cc` — must run **once**:

```bash
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

Verify it stuck:

```bash
git config --get core.hooksPath   # must print: .githooks
```

**Why this matters:** the pre-commit hook in `.githooks/pre-commit` enforces version bumps in `plugin.json` and `marketplace.json` whenever their contents change. Without `core.hooksPath` set, the hook is dormant and bad commits land silently, breaking version signaling for Claude Code's plugin cache.

**Instructions for any agent / skill / tool acting on this repo:**

1. Before performing **any** `git commit` in this repo (or in a clone of it like `~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/fx-cc`), check `git config --get core.hooksPath`.
2. If it is unset or not `.githooks`, run `git config core.hooksPath .githooks` first.
3. This is a one-time per-clone operation — idempotent and safe to re-run.
4. After this is configured, **respect the hook's verdict**: if it rejects a commit, read the error and apply the requested version bump. Never bypass with `--no-verify`.

## Security and Privacy

### Do Not Leak Private Information

**CRITICAL**: Never include private or sensitive information in code, documentation, or examples.

**Prohibited content includes**:
- Private repository names (use `owner/repo` placeholders instead)
- Internal URLs or endpoints
- API keys or credentials
- Company-specific naming or identifiers
- Private infrastructure details

**Good examples** (generic placeholders):
```bash
gh api repos/owner/repo/pulls/13
gh api graphql -f owner="owner" -f repo="repo"
```

**Bad examples** (leaking private info):
```bash
gh api repos/<real-org>/<real-private-repo>/pulls/13  # ❌ Private repo name
gh api graphql -f owner="<real-company>" -f repo="<real-service>"  # ❌ Internal identifiers
```

Note the bad examples use angle-bracket placeholders rather than plausible-looking org or service names. An illustration of the mistake must not itself commit the mistake — a realistic-looking name in a "don't do this" block is still a realistic-looking name in the repo, and it gets copied.

This applies to:
- Documentation files (README.md, AGENTS.md, REVIEW.md)
- Code examples and snippets
- Skill references and patterns
- Test cases and fixtures
- Commit messages

## Plugin Naming and Namespacing

### Plugin Names

Plugin names should be:
- **Concise**: Short, memorable identifiers
- **Descriptive**: Indicate purpose without being verbose
- **Namespace-prefixed**: Use `fx-` prefix for consistency (e.g., `fx-test`, `fx-utils`)
- **Kebab-case**: Use hyphens, not underscores or camelCase

**Good examples**:
- `fx-test` (testing utilities)
- `fx-git` (git workflow helpers)
- `fx-docs` (documentation generators)

**Avoid**:
- `test-utils` (missing namespace prefix)
- `fx_test_utilities` (underscores, too verbose)
- `fxTest` (camelCase not kebab-case)

### Component Naming Within Plugins

Skills are automatically namespaced by their plugin: `{plugin-name}:{skill-name}`.

**Avoid redundancy**:
- ❌ Plugin: `test-skill` → Skill: `test-skill:test-skill`
- ✅ Plugin: `fx-test` → Skill: `fx-test:test-helper`

Skill names should be clear, non-redundant, and descriptive of their purpose.

## Grouping Components in Plugins

### Single-Responsibility vs Multi-Component

**Use a single plugin when components are related**:

✅ **Good - Combined Plugin**:
```
fx-test/
├── skills/hello/SKILL.md
└── skills/test-helper/SKILL.md
```
Result: `fx-test:hello`, `fx-test:test-helper` — all scoped under one plugin

❌ **Poor - Separate Plugins**:
```
test-skill/
└── skills/hello/SKILL.md

test-helper/
└── skills/test-helper/SKILL.md
```
Result: Fragmented across multiple plugins for related functionality

### When to Combine

Combine components in one plugin when they:
- Share a common purpose or domain
- Are typically used together
- Form a logical feature set

**Examples**:

**`fx-git` plugin** might include:
- Skills: `commit-message`, `pr-review`, `merge-conflict-resolver`
- Commands: `/git-flow`, `/git-status`

**`fx-docs` plugin** might include:
- Skills: `api-documentation`, `readme-generator`, `doc-writer`
- Commands: `/generate-docs`

### When to Separate

Create separate plugins when components:
- Serve completely different domains
- Have different update/maintenance cycles
- Should be installable independently

**Example**: `fx-git` and `fx-aws` should be separate plugins, not combined.

## Plugin Structure

### Standard Layout

```
fx-plugin-name/
├── .claude-plugin/
│   └── plugin.json          # Required manifest
├── skills/                   # Optional: Skills
│   ├── skill-1/
│   │   └── SKILL.md
│   └── skill-2/
│       └── SKILL.md
├── commands/                 # Optional: Slash commands
│   ├── command-1.md
│   └── command-2.sh
├── hooks/                    # Optional: Workflow hooks
│   └── hooks.json
├── README.md                 # Required: Documentation
└── CHANGELOG.md             # Recommended: Version history
```

### plugin.json Minimal Format

```json
{
  "name": "fx-plugin-name",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Clear, concise description of what this plugin does"
}
```

Only `name` is required. Version and description are highly recommended.

## Skill Invocation Policy

fx/cc skills are **explicit-use only by default**. A skill may run when:

1. the user explicitly names or invokes it (for example, `/dev` or “use the dev skill”), or
2. an already active, explicitly invoked workflow calls that internal skill by name.

Do not write frontmatter descriptions that auto-trigger on generic task semantics such as “coding,” “GitHub,” “planning,” “review,” “fix,” or “create.” Do not use `MUST BE USED`, `MUST BE LOADED`, “automatically invoked,” or trigger-phrase lists to turn an ordinary request into a lifecycle invocation.

A workflow's instructions apply only to the request that invoked it and end at its documented handoff. Later standalone requests do not inherit the old workflow's orchestration rules. In particular, a simple status query, branch synchronization, PR metadata change, or explicitly approved merge should be handled directly unless the user explicitly starts another workflow.

Internal delegation remains valid: `/dev` may name `coder`, `planner`, and reviewer skills as part of its active lifecycle. That does not authorize those skills to load themselves for unrelated user requests.

## Development Workflow

### 1. Planning

Before creating a plugin:
1. **Identify the domain**: What problem does it solve?
2. **List components**: What skills, agents, commands are needed?
3. **Check for grouping**: Should these be combined or separate?
4. **Choose name**: Follow naming conventions

### 2. Implementation

1. Create plugin directory structure
2. Add `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
3. Implement components (skills, agents, etc.)
4. Write comprehensive README.md
5. Test locally using `/plugin marketplace add /path/to/fx-cc`

### 3. Testing

Test each component:
- **Skills**: Invoke them explicitly by name and verify active workflows can call their internal skills by name
- **Agents**: Check `/agents` list, invoke via Task tool
- **Commands**: Run slash commands if implemented
- **Structure**: Validate JSON with `jq empty plugin.json`

### 4. Documentation

Every plugin must have:
- **README.md**: Purpose, installation, usage examples
- **plugin.json**: Minimal required metadata
- **Component docs**: Frontmatter in skills/agents

Good documentation includes:
- Clear usage examples
- Expected behavior
- Troubleshooting tips
- Structure diagram

### 5. Marketplace Registration

Update `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`:

```json
{
  "plugins": [
    {
      "name": "fx-new-plugin",
      "source": "./plugins/fx-new-plugin"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Quality Standards

### Code Quality

- **Validate JSON**: All `.json` files must be valid
- **Frontmatter required**: All skills and agents need proper frontmatter
- **No dead references**: All paths in plugin.json must exist
- **Clear descriptions**: Help Claude and users understand purpose

### Documentation Quality

- **README.md required**: Every plugin needs documentation
- **Usage examples**: Show how to use each component
- **Expected behavior**: Document what users should see
- **Troubleshooting**: Common issues and solutions

### Testing

CI automatically validates:
- JSON structure and validity
- Required fields in manifests
- File existence for referenced components
- Frontmatter presence in markdown files

Manual testing required for:
- Actual plugin functionality
- User experience
- Component interaction

## Best Practices

### DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

- Group related components in one plugin
- Avoid creating near-duplicate plugins
- Reuse skills/agents across plugins when appropriate

### Clear Boundaries

- Each plugin should have a clear, single responsibility
- Don't create "kitchen sink" plugins with unrelated components
- Consider user install preferences (granularity)

### Versioning

- Use semantic versioning: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`
- A **pre-commit hook** enforces version bumps automatically:
  - If files inside `plugins/<name>/` change, that plugin's `plugin.json` version must be bumped
  - If any plugin version is bumped or top-level files change, `marketplace.json` `metadata.version` must be bumped
  - The hook rejects the commit with an actionable message — the LLM should read the message and apply the appropriate bump
- **Semver rules**: patch for fixes/typos, minor for new features/skills, major for breaking changes
- After cloning, run: `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`

### Backward Compatibility

- Don't remove components without major version bump
- Deprecate before removing
- Document breaking changes clearly

## Common Patterns

### Domain-Specific Plugins

Pattern: `fx-{domain}`
- `fx-git`: Git workflow tools
- `fx-aws`: AWS deployment helpers
- `fx-k8s`: Kubernetes utilities

### Utility Plugins

Pattern: `fx-{utility-type}`
- `fx-utils`: General development utilities
- `fx-docs`: Documentation generation
- `fx-lint`: Code quality tools
