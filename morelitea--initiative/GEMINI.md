# Repository Guidelines

## Frontend dev

This project uses pnpm, not npm.

### Managing AI-Generated Planning Documents

AI assistants often create planning and design documents during development:

- PLAN.md, IMPLEMENTATION.md, ARCHITECTURE.md
- DESIGN.md, CODEBASE_SUMMARY.md, INTEGRATION_PLAN.md
- TESTING_GUIDE.md, TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md, and similar files

**Best Practice: Use a dedicated directory for these ephemeral files**

**Recommended approach:**

- Create a `history/` directory in the project root
- Store ALL AI-generated planning/design docs in `history/`
- Keep the repository root clean and focused on permanent project files
- Only access `history/` when explicitly asked to review past planning

**Example .gitignore entry (optional):**

```
# AI planning documents (ephemeral)
history/
```

**Benefits:**

- ✅ Clean repository root
- ✅ Clear separation between ephemeral and permanent documentation
- ✅ Easy to exclude from version control if desired
- ✅ Preserves planning history for archeological research
- ✅ Reduces noise when browsing the project

## Project Structure & Module Organization

`backend/` hosts the FastAPI service; routers sit in `app/api`, config in `core`, persistence helpers in `db`, domain models in `models`, payloads in `schemas`, and business logic in `services`, with `main.py` as the uvicorn entry point. `frontend/src` stays feature-first (`api`, `components`, `features`, `pages`, `hooks`, `lib`, `types`). Dockerfiles plus the root `docker-compose.yml` wire Postgres, backend, and the nginx React build.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

- `cd backend && python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate && pip install -r requirements.txt` — install runtime deps.
- `cd backend && poetry install` — optional, but grabs dev tools (pytest, Ruff) defined in `pyproject.toml`.
- `cd backend && uvicorn app.main:app --reload` — run the API on http://localhost:8000.
- `cd backend && alembic upgrade head` — apply the latest database migrations (or run `python -m app.db.init_db` to migrate plus seed defaults).
- `cd backend && alembic revision --autogenerate -m "desc"` — generate a migration after SQLModel changes.
- `cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev` — launch the Vite dev server (uses `VITE_API_URL`, defaults to `http://localhost:8000/api/v1`).
- `docker-compose up --build` — start Postgres 17, backend, and the nginx SPA.
- `cd backend && pytest` / `ruff check app` and `cd frontend && npm run lint` — run tests and linters.

## Generated API Types (Orval)

Frontend TypeScript types and React Query hooks in `frontend/src/api/generated/` are auto-generated from the backend's OpenAPI spec using Orval. **Do not hand-edit these files.**

- `frontend/src/types/api.ts` re-exports all generated types and adds backward-compatible aliases (e.g., `Task = TaskListRead`).
- Generated files are committed to the repo so the frontend builds without a running backend.

**After changing backend schemas** (`backend/app/schemas/`), regenerate:

```bash
# Option 1: With a running backend
cd frontend && pnpm generate:api

# Option 2: Without a running backend
cd backend && python scripts/export_openapi.py ../frontend/openapi.json
cd frontend && pnpm orval
```

Always commit the regenerated output. CI enforces this — the `check-generated-types` job will fail if generated files don't match the current backend schemas.

**Key files:**
- `frontend/orval.config.ts` — Orval configuration
- `frontend/src/api/mutator.ts` — Axios wrapper that preserves auth/guild interceptors
- `frontend/scripts/generate-api.sh` — Generation script (supports `--from-spec <path>` for CI)
- `backend/scripts/export_openapi.py` — Exports OpenAPI JSON without a running server

## Versioning

This project uses **semantic versioning** (semver) with a single source of truth: the `VERSION` file at the project root.

### How Versioning Works

- **Single source**: The `VERSION` file contains the current version (e.g., `0.1.0`)
- **Backend**: Reads VERSION file and exposes via `/api/v1/version` endpoint and OpenAPI schema
- **Frontend**: Vite injects VERSION as `__APP_VERSION__` constant, displayed in the sidebar footer
- **Docker**: VERSION is copied into the image and set as OCI labels

### Releasing a Version

Releases are managed by `scripts/promote.sh`, which creates a PR from `dev` to `main` with the version bump and changelog stamp. Only code owners (@jordandrako, @LeeJMorel) can run this script.

```bash
# Patch release (0.29.1 → 0.29.2)
./scripts/promote.sh --patch

# Minor release (0.29.1 → 0.30.0)
./scripts/promote.sh --minor

# Major release (0.29.1 → 1.0.0)
./scripts/promote.sh --major

# Preview without making changes
./scripts/promote.sh --dry-run
```

After the release PR merges to `main`, `tag-release.yml` auto-creates the version tag, which triggers the Docker build and GitHub Release.

### Semantic Versioning Guidelines

- **MAJOR** (1.0.0): Breaking changes, incompatible API changes
- **MINOR** (0.2.0): New features, backward-compatible additions
- **PATCH** (0.1.1): Bug fixes, backward-compatible fixes

### Changelog Maintenance

**IMPORTANT**: Always update `CHANGELOG.md` when making significant changes.

**Determining where to add changes:**

1. Check git log for recent "bump version to X.Y.Z" commits
2. If that version exists, it's already released
3. Add your changes to an `[Unreleased]` section at the top of the changelog
4. When the version is bumped, the unreleased section becomes the new version

**Example workflow:**

```bash
# Check recent history
git log --oneline --grep="bump version" -n 1

# If output shows "bump version to 0.7.2"
# Then 0.7.2 is released, add changes to [Unreleased]
```

**Changelog format:**

```markdown
## [Unreleased]

### Added

- New features go here

### Changed

- Modifications to existing features

### Fixed

- Bug fixes

## [0.7.2] - 2026-01-12

...existing released versions...
```

**Rules:**

- ✅ Update changelog for all feature additions, breaking changes, and bug fixes
- ✅ Use `[Unreleased]` section if the current VERSION has already been tagged
- ✅ Keep entries concise and user-focused
- ❌ Do NOT add changelog entries for minor refactoring or internal changes
- ❌ Do NOT put new changes under an already-released version number

### Docker Builds with Specific Versions

Build Docker images with version labels:

```bash
export VERSION=$(cat VERSION)
docker-compose build --build-arg VERSION=$VERSION
```

The version will be included as OCI image labels and available in the container.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

Python uses 4-space indentation, full type hints, `snake_case` modules/functions, and `PascalCase` SQLModel or schema classes; keep routing thin and push validation to `schemas` and `services`. React components are `PascalCase` files, hooks follow the `useThing` convention, and shared helpers live in `frontend/src/lib` or `api`. Ruff and ESLint must pass before opening a PR.

## Testing Guidelines

Write Pytest suites under `backend/tests`, exercising API routers with `httpx.AsyncClient` fixtures and covering RBAC, JWT flows, and initiative visibility rules. For new UI logic, add Vitest + Testing Library specs under the relevant feature folder (or `frontend/src/__tests__`); prioritize coverage for auth, project CRUD, and optimistic updates.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

History favors short subjects (e.g., `MVP WIP 1`), so keep the first line imperative, ≤50 chars, and use additional lines for detail. Do not mention coding agents in commit messages. Separate backend, frontend, and infra changes when practical. PRs must describe the problem, list notable changes, call out schema or env updates, and attach screenshots/GIFs for UI tweaks plus the exact commands you ran for testing.

## Security & Configuration Tips

Copy `backend/.env.example`, set `DATABASE_URL`, `SECRET_KEY`, `AUTO_APPROVED_EMAIL_DOMAINS`, and optional `FIRST_SUPERUSER_*`, then run `alembic upgrade head` (or `python -m app.db.init_db`) so the schema is current and default settings/SUs are seeded. The SPA reads `VITE_API_URL`; align it with the reverse-proxy host in every environment. If enabling OIDC, ensure `APP_URL` is publicly reachable so computed callback URLs stay valid.

## Guild Architecture Notes

- Guilds are the primary tenancy boundary. Every user can join multiple guilds, and most API endpoints infer the active guild from the `X-Guild-ID` header (set by the SPA) or fall back to `users.active_guild_id`. Always include the guild header in new client calls when the route depends on guild context.
- Guild membership has two roles (`admin`, `member`). Guild admins own memberships, invites, initiative/project configuration, and can delete their guild; they cannot delete users from the entire app. Keep server-side checks scoped to guild roles, not legacy global roles.
- The bootstrap super user (ID `1`) is the only account allowed to change app-wide configuration (OIDC, SMTP email, branding accents, role labels). Those routes live under `/settings/admin` in the SPA and corresponding `/api/v1/settings/*` endpoints check for that ID explicitly.
- `.env` supports `DISABLE_GUILD_CREATION`. When set to `true`, POST `/guilds/` must return 403 and the frontend should hide “Create guild” affordances, forcing new users to redeem invites issued by guild admins.
- Every new guild automatically seeds a "Default Initiative" and makes the creator a guild admin. Be mindful when writing migrations or services so this invariant remains intact, especially when cascading deletes (guild deletion must clean up initiatives, projects, tasks, memberships, and settings).

## Docker Deployment

This project uses GitHub Actions to automatically build and publish Docker images to Docker Hub.

### How It Works

- **Automatic builds**: Triggered when you push version tags (e.g., `v0.1.1`)
- **Multi-arch support**: Builds for both `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` (Apple Silicon)
- **Multiple tags**: Creates `latest`, `1`, `1.2`, and `1.2.3` tags for flexibility
- **Version injection**: Builds Docker images with the correct VERSION from tags

### Setup Requirements

**First-time setup** (see `.github/DOCKER_SETUP.md` for details):

1. Create a Docker Hub access token with Read & Write permissions
2. Add GitHub secrets:
   - `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` - Your Docker Hub username
   - `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` - Your Docker Hub access token

### Deployment Workflow

The typical deployment process:

```bash
# 1. Create a release PR (bumps version + stamps changelog)
./scripts/promote.sh --patch   # or --minor / --major

# 2. Merge the release PR on GitHub

# 3. tag-release.yml auto-creates the version tag
#    docker-publish.yml builds, publishes, and notifies

# 4. Verify on Docker Hub
# Check: https://hub.docker.com/r/USERNAME/initiative/tags
```

The GitHub Actions workflow will:

- Build the Docker image with the new version
- Tag it appropriately (e.g., `latest`, `0.1`, `0.1.1`)
- Push to Docker Hub
- Support both x86_64 and ARM architectures

### Using Published Images

The easiest way to get started is with docker-compose:

```bash
# Copy the example configuration
cp docker-compose.example.yml docker-compose.yml

# Update SECRET_KEY and other settings as needed
nano docker-compose.yml

# Start the application
docker-compose up -d
```

This will:

- Pull the latest image from Docker Hub (`morelitea/initiative:latest`)
- Start PostgreSQL 17 database
- Configure automatic restarts and health checks
- Mount persistent volumes for uploads

Or pull and run manually:

```bash
docker pull morelitea/initiative:latest
docker pull morelitea/initiative:0.1.1  # specific version
```

### Manual Deployment

To trigger a build without a version tag:

1. Go to GitHub Actions → "Build and Push Docker Image"
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. Optionally specify a custom tag

### Important Notes

- Images include the VERSION file and expose version via `/api/v1/version`
- Frontend version checking will detect new deployments automatically
- Builds use GitHub Actions cache for faster subsequent builds
- Both backend and frontend are bundled in a single image

## Landing the Plane (Session Completion)

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**

- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds
