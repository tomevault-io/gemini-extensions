# CLAUDE.md — project memory for Repo2RLEnv

This file is auto-loaded by Claude Code in this repo. Keep it tight; longer prose belongs in `docs/`.

## What this is

**Repo2RLEnv** (`repo2rlenv` on PyPI) turns any GitHub repository into a verifiable RL training/eval dataset. End-to-end: **synthesis → standardize → train + eval**, focus on training. We emit datasets in the [Harbor](https://github.com/harbor-framework/harbor) task format so they drop straight into Harbor's runtime ecosystem (Local Docker / Modal / Daytona / E2B / Runloop + 22 agent harnesses).

## Architecture

Three layers, only the first is ours:

| Layer | We ship | We delegate |
|---|---|---|
| **Generation** (pipelines that produce tasks) | `src/repo2rlenv/pipelines/` — the moat | — |
| **Spec** (uniform output format) | `[metadata.repo2env]` extension to Harbor's `task.toml` | Harbor's task spec |
| **Consumption** (sandboxes / agents / runtime) | HF Hub publish bridge; planned TRL trainer bridge | Harbor's full stack |

```

## Pipeline contract

Every synthesis pipeline implements `repo2rlenv.pipelines.base.Pipeline`:

```python
class Pipeline(Protocol):
    name: ClassVar[PipelineName]
    def __init__(self, input: GenerationInput, options: BaseModel) -> None: ...
    def run(self, out_dir: Path) -> PipelineResult: ...
```

The conformance test (`tests/test_pipeline_contract.py`) fails for any registered pipeline that doesn't conform. **Always run** `uv run pytest tests/test_pipeline_contract.py` after touching anything in `pipelines/`.

Adding a new pipeline: see [`docs/pipelines/ADDING_A_PIPELINE.md`](./docs/pipelines/ADDING_A_PIPELINE.md).

## UI conventions (use the shared module, not raw prints)

**Never use `print()`** in CLI code. Always:

```python
from repo2rlenv.ui import console

console.success("emitted task X")          # ✓ green
console.info("starting pipeline...")        # ⓘ cyan
console.warn("smoke gate exited 5")         # ⚠ yellow
console.error("docker daemon down")         # ✗ red
console.kv({"reward": 0.98, ...}, title="...")    # panel with key/value table
with console.section("Pushing to Hub"): ... # bracketed rule
```

For long-running tasks with a redrawing display, build a view in `src/repo2rlenv/ui/views/`. Pattern:

```python
with BootstrapView(...) as view:
    ensure_bootstrap(..., on_turn=view.on_turn,
                          on_phase=view.on_phase,
                          on_thinking=view.on_thinking,
                          on_executing=view.on_executing)
    view.set_outcome(success=True, ...)
```

Logging is routed through `RichHandler` via `install_logging()` (called from `cli.py:main()`). Noisy library loggers (litellm/httpx/anthropic/openai) are auto-suppressed to WARNING while a Live is active.

## Input sources + auth resolution

`--repo` accepts a GitHub `owner/name`, a `gitlab.com` URL, or a local path (`/abs`, `./rel`, `~`, `file://` — canonicalized to `file://<abspath>`). `RepoSpec.source_kind` classifies it; `sources.py` defines `Capability` (pull_requests / issues / commit_api) per source and each pipeline's `required_capabilities`. `cmd_generate` gates incompatible combos up front (e.g. `pr_diff` on a local repo → blocked with a clear error). Git/source pipelines (`commit_runtime`, `code_instruct`, `equivalence_tests`) run on any source; `pr_diff`/`pr_runtime` mine PRs/MRs so they run on GitHub **or** GitLab (gitlab.com MRs via `gitlab.py` REST client, dispatched by `provider.py`); `cve_patches` is GitHub-only (OSV + GitHub commit API). GitLab MR mining shipped in #62.

`auth.resolve_repo_token()` dispatches by source: local → None (no `gh` shell-out); gitlab → `repo.auth_token_env` then `$GITLAB_TOKEN`; github → `auth.resolve_github_token()`, which checks in order:
1. `repo.auth_token_env` env var (if explicitly set in config)
2. `gh auth token` (default — works for any user who's `gh auth login`'d)
3. `$GITHUB_TOKEN`
4. None (anonymous; fails for private repos)

HF Hub auth is the `huggingface_hub` library's auto-resolution (`~/.cache/huggingface/token` or `$HF_TOKEN`). LLM keys via provider-default env vars (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, ...) — see `auth.resolve_llm_api_key()`.

Registry push creds (for `_runtime` image distribution) resolve from explicit env vars first: GHCR reads `GHCR_TOKEN`/`GITHUB_TOKEN` (needs `gh auth refresh -h github.com -s write:packages` one-time); Docker Hub reads `DOCKER_USERNAME`+`DOCKER_TOKEN` (PAT — preferred over the credstore's pull-only OAuth token), and pushes under the Docker Hub *user's* namespace. Multi-repo datasets push one image per repo + rewrite each task to its own digest. See `docs/reference/REGISTRY_AUTH.md`.

## Cost tracking

`llm.complete()` returns `LLMResponse.cost_usd` via `litellm.completion_cost(response)` — uses LiteLLM's built-in model_cost map. Accumulated in `AgentOutcome.total_cost_estimate_usd` and `BootstrapResult.llm_cost_estimate_usd`. `BootstrapSpec.max_llm_spend_usd` is enforced inside the agent loop (`agent.py:run_agent_loop`): when running `total_cost ≥ max_spend_usd`, the loop short-circuits with `success=False, reason="cost budget exceeded: ..."`. The runner logs the configured budget at startup.

## Conventions for changes

The canonical contributor reference is [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md) at the repo root — read it before non-trivial changes. The high-leverage bits:

- **`uv add <pkg>`** for dependencies. Never hand-edit `pyproject.toml`'s `dependencies` array.
- **No `Co-Authored-By: Claude` trailer** on commits. User explicitly rejected it; see `~/.claude/projects/.../memory/feedback_no_coauthor.md`.
- **Commits**: terse subject + short body explaining "why". Don't reference the current task; that goes in the PR description.
- **PRs**: title under 70 chars; description has summary + test plan + out-of-scope items. Close issues via `Closes #N` in commit body.
- **Tests**: every code change should keep the suite green. `uv run pytest -q` is the canonical command. **620/620 must pass.**
- **Lint + format**: `uv run ruff check .` and `uv run ruff format .` before commit. CI rejects unformatted code or lint violations.
- **Acknowledgments**: when a file draws inspiration from external work, add a header block crediting the source repo + paper + license + clarifying our license posture. See `bootstrap/__init__.py` or `reward.py` for the format.

## CI / CD (GitHub Actions)

Two workflows under `.github/workflows/`:

- **`ci.yml`** — runs on every push to `main` + every PR. Three jobs: `lint` (ruff check + format check), `test` matrix over Python **3.12 / 3.13 / 3.14**, and `build` (uv build sdist + wheel + smoke install). All three must pass for a merge.
- **`release.yml`** — fires on GitHub Release `published` events. Re-runs the full test matrix on the tag, builds, publishes to PyPI via `PYPI_API_TOKEN` repo secret, attaches sdist + wheel to the Release page. Manual re-runs via `workflow_dispatch -f tag=vX.Y.Z` if a publish step fails.

Cutting a release (full flow):

1. Bump `version` in `pyproject.toml`. `__version__` reads from `importlib.metadata` so no other code change needed.
2. Commit + push to `main`. CI confirms tests green.
3. `git tag vX.Y.Z && git push origin vX.Y.Z`
4. `gh release create vX.Y.Z --generate-notes` (or web UI)
5. `release.yml` auto-publishes to PyPI and attaches artifacts to the Release.

`PYPI_API_TOKEN` lives in repo secrets ONLY. Don't paste it into chat, `.env`, or any committed file. The `pypi` GitHub environment is in place but currently has no protection rules — adding a deployment approval rule there is a one-click upgrade if we ever want a manual gate before publish.

## Cheatsheet — common tasks

```bash
# Run a full bootstrap with the live UI (interactive terminal only)
./demo_bootstrap.sh

# Full end-to-end demo: bootstrap → generate → validate → harbor (oracle + opencode×2)
./demo_e2e.sh                                # default: pallets/click
REPO=pocketbase/pocketbase ./demo_e2e.sh     # different repo

# Generate a sandbox-verified dataset (auto-triggers bootstrap if needed)
uv run repo2rlenv generate \
  --repo <owner>/<repo> --pipeline pr_runtime \
  --pipeline-opt limit=10 \
  --llm anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6 \
  --out ./datasets/<dataset-name>

# Validate a dataset (fast structural check, no LLM, no Docker)
uv run repo2rlenv validate ./datasets/<dataset-name>

# Publish to HF Hub (bare name auto-resolves owner via whoami)
uv run repo2rlenv push ./datasets/<dataset-name> <your-org>/<dataset-name>

# Pull a published dataset back
uv run repo2rlenv pull <your-org>/<dataset-name>

# Run all tests + lint + format check (everything CI runs)
uv run pytest -q
uv run ruff check .
uv run ruff format --check .

# Add a dep
uv add <pkg>            # runtime
uv add --dev <pkg>      # dev only
```

## Key external dependencies

- **Harbor** (`uv tool install harbor`) — runs our generated tasks. We don't ship a parallel runtime.
- **Docker** — required for the `bootstrap` phase and any `_runtime` pipeline. `pr_diff` *generates* without Docker, but its emitted task *runs* in Docker (thin `python:3.12-slim` env); set `emit_harbor_env=False` for pure-text output that needs no Docker at all.
- **LiteLLM** — single client across all LLM providers (Anthropic / OpenAI / HF Router / Bedrock / Ollama / vLLM).
- **Rich** — every CLI surface; foundation of `src/repo2rlenv/ui/`.
- **huggingface_hub** — dataset publish/pull; auto-resolves token from `~/.cache/huggingface/token`.
- **`gh` CLI** — clone + PR listing. The path of least friction for GitHub auth.

## Notable design decisions

1. **No bind mounts for the bootstrap container** — we `docker cp` the repo files into the container so `docker commit` captures them. Bind mounts are runtime overlays and aren't included in committed images. See `bootstrap/docker.py:DockerSandbox.start`.
2. **Lenient smoke gate** — pytest exit codes 0, 1, and 5 are all "env works" (1 = tests failed but ran; 5 = no tests collected). Only 2+ flags a real env problem. See `bootstrap/runner.py`.
3. **Test commands joined with `&&`** — `test_cmds` is a list run as one bash invocation so `export PATH=...` carries over to the next command. Don't iterate the list with `sandbox.exec(each)`.
4. **registry_url uses Harbor's legacy format** — we publish a `registry.json` to HF Hub that `harbor download --registry-url <hf-url>` can consume directly. No Harbor patches needed.
5. **No `repo2rlenv run` / no parallel sandbox runtime** — for full tasks, users run `harbor run`. We're synthesis-only.
6. **Multi-repo datasets are supported in both push modes** — `inline` bakes each task's own bootstrap recipe (built from the verified `rebuild_cmds`, NOT the agent transcript); `registry` pushes each distinct image and rewrites each task to its own digest. `push` clean-syncs `tasks/**` (a removed task disappears from the Hub) and auto-writes `manifest.json`. `pr_runtime` ships `tests/{verifier.py,f2p.json,p2p.json}` as plain files (Harbor mounts `tests/` at `/tests`) — no base64 in `test.sh`.

## Status (May 2026)

- **v0.1.0** shipped on PyPI: `pr_diff` (originally `pr_mining_lite`) + HF Hub publish + diff-similarity reward
- **v0.2** merged into main: bootstrap phase, Rich UI module, cost tracking, content-addressed cache keyed on bootstrap options
- **v0.3.0** shipped on PyPI: `pr_runtime` (sandbox-verified PR mining) + auto-trigger bootstrap from `generate` + structural quality filters + targeted test invocation + CI/CD (ruff + matrix tests + release workflow)
- **v0.4.0** shipped on PyPI: polyglot log parsers (Go / Cargo / Jest) + Harbor end-to-end compliance fixes (task.name format, solve.sh shim, /logs/verifier/reward.txt, PATH prelude for non-Python toolchains, defensive git install)
- **v0.5.0** shipped on PyPI: `pr_stream` (continuous PR mining with watermark state — removed in v0.8.3 as scope-creep; pr_runtime handles the same niche on its own) + `commit_runtime` (commit-level mining, SWE-GEN style). Both Harbor-verified.
- **v0.6.0** shipped on PyPI: first LLM-synthesized pipelines — `mutation_bugs` (procedural AST bug injection inspired by SWE-smith) + `code_instruct` (repo-anchored OSS-Instruct with executable verifiers, inspired by Magicoder). Both Harbor-verified on `pallets/click` (Mean reward 1.000).
- **v0.7.0** shipped on PyPI: `equivalence_tests` (R2E-style function-level synthesis — extract real function, LLM writes equivalence test against `reference_<name>` oracle, gold patch fills the candidate) + `cve_patches` (OSV-driven CVE→fix-commit pipeline, reuses pr_runtime validation harness). Both Harbor-verified.
- **v0.8.0** shipped on PyPI: `refactor_synthesis` (Python-native rename-refactor mining — drops the v1.0-planned JVM RefactoringMiner dep; commit-message regex + diff verification + multi-criteria structural+behavioral verifier). Harbor-verified on `pallets/click` (Mean reward 1.000).
- **v0.9 (in progress)**: **removed `mutation_bugs` + `refactor_synthesis`** (pipeline audit — both binary-reward, Python-only, lowest signal value: synthetic AST bugs are unrealistic; renames are a near-no-op RL target). **6 pipelines now active.** Shared helpers (`make_unified_diff`, `build_binary_eval_script`) moved from `mutation_bugs.py` to `pipelines/_eval_script.py`. Planned next: env-setup pipeline (Repo2Run/SetupBench-style, agent makes a bare repo's tests run green), `test_synthesis` (SWE-Flow-style TDD), graded rewards for the binary synthesis pipelines, LLM-judged QA gate, iterative refinement loop for `equivalence_tests`.
- **v0.8.4 shipped on PyPI**: input-source abstraction (GitHub/GitLab/local, capability-gated) + GitLab MR mining for `pr_diff`/`pr_runtime` + **`commit_runtime` promoted to stable** (3 stable now: `pr_diff`, `pr_runtime`, `commit_runtime`). commit_runtime gained LLM-synthesized leak-free instructions (`synthesize_with_llm` default on) + `max_pass_to_pass` cap; audit went 33%→100% clean, Opus solves the sampled tasks (4/4 genuine). Reference dataset `…commit-runtime-test` (100 envs).
- **anti-contamination pass (merged, PR #69)**: sandbox-verified tasks were gameable — an agent could fetch the published fix (and hidden tests) for the repo it was asked to fix. Now baked into the emitter for every task via `pipelines/_env_guard.py`: **git-history scrub** (strip the repo to `base_commit`: remove `origin`, prune future refs/commits, gc) + **egress guard** (`environment/docker-compose.yaml` blackholing PyPI+GitHub hosts so `pip download`/`git fetch`/web-fetch fail; model API + agent install stay up). Also: `cve_patches` now ships a **graded F2P/P2P verifier** (was binary whole-suite — scored the gold patch 0.0 on unrelated suite failures), a **leak-stripped instruction**, and **agentic PoC-test synthesis** (`_poc_agent.py`: an LLM with shell access in the vulnerable sandbox writes a regression test for no-test CVEs). `bootstrap` re-bootstraps when a cache hit points at an evicted image. Reference dataset `…-cve-patches` (19 verified envs); `cve_patches` stays **experimental**. Full write-up: `plans/reward_hacking_writeups.md`. The principle: the environment enforces, the prompt never asks.
- **v0.8.6 shipped on PyPI**: `code_instruct` self-improvement pass — the v0.6 prompt explicitly *forbade* using repo APIs, producing generic Codeforces-lite tasks (baseline audit: mean repo-anchoring 1.4/5, zero of 20 imported the target package). Reoriented around genuine repo anchoring with four post-synthesis gates in `_oss_instruct.py` (`check_repo_anchoring`, `check_symbol_collision`, `check_test_strength`, `task_fingerprints`) + `max_attempts_per_seed` retries default 1→3. Post-fix audit: RA=4.95, TR=4.95, zero scores ≤ 2. Multi-agent validation (claude-code + Sonnet 4.6, codex + GPT-5.3-Codex, openhands-sdk + Qwen3.6-35B via HF Router) surfaced a second bug: all three models correctly implemented the requested logic but wrote to natural filenames (`ranged_float.py`, `fetcher.py`), failing pytest `from task_module import ...` collection with `ModuleNotFoundError`. Fix: append a `task_module.py` delivery-contract paragraph to the emitted `instruction.md`. Solve rate 40% → 80% at fixed dataset size. **Reference dataset `…-code-instruct` (100 envs across 5 Python repos)** now the first published dataset for this pipeline. `code_instruct` stays **experimental** pending graded reward + polyglot support.
- **v0.8.7 shipped on PyPI**: `equivalence_tests` self-improvement pass — the v0.7 pipeline had a full-source-in-instruction leak AND a 97% Stage-B failure rate on click (root cause: extracted functions referenced repo-internal types like `Argument`/`FC` that don't exist in the standalone `task_module.py`, so import crashed before pytest reached the LLM's assertions). Landed: leak-free instruction (`signature_only_source`), annotation-strip at bake time (`strip_annotations`), scope-aware purity + self-containment filter in the extractor (`_references_only_safe_names`), `is_module_importable` pre-flight, recursion-safe rename (`rename_function_ast`), feedback-driven retry (`max_attempts_per_function` default 1→3, was documented but not wired), test-strength gate (`check_equivalence_test_strength`), task dedup (`_equivalence_fingerprint`), sharper prompt, `.debug_skips` dumps, and `all_tests_passed` moved to shared `_eval_script.py`. **Reference dataset target deferred to v0.8.8** — the 5-repo click/flask/requests/attrs/starlette survey yielded only ~8 pure candidates combined (framework-heavy repos are structurally weak fits for equivalence testing); the v0.8.7 release is pipeline-hardening only, and the dataset ships once we survey utility-heavy libs (packaging, itsdangerous, markupsafe, dateutil, etc.). `equivalence_tests` stays **experimental**.
- No new pipelines planned in `docs/pipelines/` beyond the above — see [`docs/pipelines/README.md`](./docs/pipelines/README.md) for the full table

### Naming convention (post-rename)

Pipelines follow `{source}_{shape}`:
- `_diff` — text-only generation, no sandbox at gen time (e.g. `pr_diff`). NB: `pr_diff` still emits a thin Docker env so the diff-similarity reward runs under `harbor` — "no sandbox" refers to generation, not consumption.
- `_runtime` — runs inside the bootstrap sandbox to verify the oracle (e.g. `pr_runtime`, `commit_runtime`)
- `_patches` / `_instruct` / `_tests` — name of the artifact type for synthesized pipelines (the `_bugs` and `_synthesis` shapes were retired with `mutation_bugs` / `refactor_synthesis` in v0.9)

If anything in this file conflicts with the actual code, **trust the code** and fix this file.
