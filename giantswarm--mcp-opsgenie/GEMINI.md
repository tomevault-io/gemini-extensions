# Task Master Development Workflow
This guide outlines the typical process for using Task Master to manage software development projects.

# The Development Workflow

This document outlines the standard, iterative process for all development work. Following this workflow is **mandatory** to ensure consistency, quality, and effective collaboration across the project.

## The Core Development Loop

All work, from new features to bug fixes, follows this fundamental three-phase cycle:

1.  **Phase 1: Planning & Alignment**
    -   Select an issue from the backlog.
    -   Create a dedicated branch for your work.
    -   Explore the codebase to create a detailed implementation strategy.

2.  **Phase 2: Iterative Implementation**
    -   **Log your plan first.** Document your intended changes in the relevant task *before* writing code.
    -   Implement the changes, adhering to the project's architectural guidelines.
    -   Continuously log progress, discoveries, and setbacks as you work to create a rich history of the task.

3.  **Phase 3: Finalization & Committing**
    -   Write and pass all required tests.
    -   Format your code according to project standards.
    -   Update any relevant project rules based on your changes.
    -   Commit your work using a structured, conventional commit message.
    -   Close the corresponding issue.

---

## Phase 1: Planning & Alignment

Before writing a single line of implementation code, you must have a clear plan and be working on the correct branch.

### 1.1. Select an Issue & State Your Intent

1.  **List Open Issues:** Use `mcp_github_list_issues` to see available tasks for `giantswarm/mcp-opsgenie`.
2.  **Choose an Issue:** Select the highest-priority issue you are able to work on.
3.  **Get Details:** Use `mcp_github_get_issue` to retrieve its full details.
4.  **Announce Your Plan:** In the chat, you **MUST** summarize the issue (title, number) and your intended high-level approach.
    -   **Example:** *"I am starting work on issue #37: Refactor Capability API. My plan is to start by defining the new interfaces in the API package..."*

### 1.2. Create a Dedicated Git Branch

**NEVER** commit directly to the `main` branch.

1.  **Check Your Current Branch:** Run `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`.
2.  **Create a New Branch:** If you are on `main`, create a new branch immediately. Branch names **MUST** follow this format:
    > `<type>/issue-<number>-<kebab-case-title>`
3.  **Branch Types:** `feature`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, `chore`.
4.  **Example:** `git checkout -b feature/issue-42-add-prometheus-provider`

### 1.3. Explore and Plan

This is a critical step to ensure your implementation is well-considered.

1.  **Explore the Codebase:** Identify the specific files, functions, and lines of code that need to be added, removed, or changed.
2.  **Formulate a Detailed Plan:** Based on your exploration, create a precise implementation plan. What is the exact diff you intend to apply? What potential challenges do you foresee? This plan will be logged in the next step.

---

## Phase 2: Iterative Implementation & Logging

This cycle is the heart of the workflow. It's designed to build a rich, contextual history of the implementation, which is invaluable for debugging, collaboration, and future reference.

### 2.1. Log Your Plan *Before* Coding

1.  Before you start implementing, log the detailed plan you created in step 1.3.
2.  Use the `mcp_taskmaster-ai_update_subtask` tool. The prompt should be a complete summary of your findings and your intended approach.
3.  Verify that the plan was successfully logged by viewing the task details again.

### 2.2. Implement & Log Progress

1.  **Set Task Status:** Mark the task as `in-progress` (e.g., `mcp_taskmaster-ai_set_task_status --id=<subtaskId> --status=in-progress`).
2.  **Write Code:** Begin writing code according to your plan and the project's [architecture.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/architecture.mdc).
3.  **Log Continuously:** As you work, you will learn things. **You must log them.** Regularly use `mcp_taskmaster-ai_update_subtask` to append new findings.
    -   ✅ **What Worked:** Confirmed approaches, "fundamental truths."
    -   ❌ **What Didn't Work:** Dead ends, failed experiments, and why.
    -   ⚙️ **Specifics:** Successful code snippets, configurations, or commands.
    -   🗣️ **Decisions:** Any choices made, especially if confirmed with the user.

---

## Phase 3: Finalization & Committing

### 3.1. Pre-Commit Quality Check

Before **every** commit, you **MUST** perform these checks:

1.  **Format Code:**
    ```bash
    goimports -w .
    go fmt ./...
    ```
2.  **Run All Tests:**
    ```bash
    make test
    ```
    -   **DO NOT** commit if any tests are failing. Fix the tests first.
    -   Code must meet the test coverage minimums defined in [architecture.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/architecture.mdc).
3.  **Update TUI Snapshots (if applicable):**
    -   If you made changes to the TUI, update the golden files: `NO_COLOR=true go test ./internal/tui/view/... -update`.
    -   Review the changes to ensure they are intentional.

### 3.2. Review & Update Rules

1.  Review your implementation and the chat history.
2.  Identify any new patterns, conventions, or best practices that emerged.
3.  Update existing rules or create new ones, following the guidelines in [cursor_rules.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/cursor_rules.mdc). This is a critical step for our collective improvement.

### 3.3. Craft the Commit Message

Commit messages are vital documentation. They **MUST** follow the [Conventional Commits](mdc:https:/www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0) specification.

**Structure:**
```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```
-   **Type:** `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, `chore`, `style`, `perf`, `ci`, `build`.
-   **Scope (Optional):** The area of the codebase affected (e.g., `api`, `tui`, `capability`).
-   **Subject:** A short, imperative-tense summary. No period at the end.
-   **Body (Recommended):** Explain the *what* and *why* of the change.
-   **Footer:** Reference the issue being closed using `Closes #<issue_number>`. This automatically links the commit to the issue and closes it. Include `BREAKING CHANGE:` for any backward-incompatible changes.

**Example:**
```
feat(api): Add GetWorkflow handler

Implement the GetWorkflow function in the API layer to allow services
to retrieve workflow definitions by name. This is a prerequisite
for the workflow execution engine.

Closes #52
```

### 3.4. Commit, Push, and Finalize

1.  **Commit Changes:**
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "..."
    ```
2.  **Push Branch:**
    ```bash
    git push origin <your-branch-name>
    ```
3.  **Mark Task Done:** Set the task status to `done` (e.g., `mcp_taskmaster-ai_set_task_status --id=<subtaskId> --status=done`).
4.  **Announce Completion:** Inform the user that your changes have been pushed and the issue has been closed.

## Task Management Using Task Master

This project uses **Task Master** for task management. While the principles of the workflow above are universal, the specific commands below relate to this tool.

-   **Primary Interaction:** The `mcp_taskmaster-ai_*` tools are the preferred method of interaction. The `task-master` CLI is a fallback. See [taskmaster.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/taskmaster.mdc) for a full command reference.
-   **Project Setup:** New projects start with `mcp_taskmaster-ai_initialize_project` or by parsing a requirements document with `mcp_taskmaster-ai_parse_prd`.
-   **Task Breakdown:**
    -   Before implementation, complex tasks should be analyzed (`mcp_taskmaster-ai_analyze_project_complexity`) and then broken down into subtasks (`mcp_taskmaster-ai_expand_task`).
    -   Use the `--force` flag to replace existing subtasks if the breakdown needs to be redone.
-   **Handling Change:** If an implementation choice affects future work, update the upcoming tasks using `mcp_taskmaster-ai_update` (for multiple tasks) or `mcp_taskmaster-ai_update_task` (for a single task).
-   **Dependencies:** Maintain a clear order of operations by managing prerequisites with `mcp_taskmaster-ai_add_dependency` and `mcp_taskmaster-ai_remove_dependency`.
-   **Reorganization:** Use `mcp_taskmaster-ai_move_task` to refactor the task hierarchy as the project evolves.
- **status**: Current state of the task (Example: `"pending"`, `"done"`, `"deferred"`)
- **dependencies**: IDs of prerequisite tasks (Example: `[1, 2.1]`)
    - Dependencies are displayed with status indicators (✅ for completed, ⏱️ for pending)
    - This helps quickly identify which prerequisite tasks are blocking work
- **priority**: Importance level (Example: `"high"`, `"medium"`, `"low"`)
- **details**: In-depth implementation instructions (Example: `"Use GitHub client ID/secret, handle callback, set session token."`) 
- **testStrategy**: Verification approach (Example: `"Deploy and call endpoint to confirm 'Hello World' response."`) 
- **subtasks**: List of smaller, more specific tasks (Example: `[{"id": 1, "title": "Configure OAuth", ...}]`) 
- Refer to task structure details (previously linked to `tasks.mdc`).

## Configuration Management (Updated)

Taskmaster configuration is managed through two main mechanisms:

1.  **`.taskmaster/config.json` File (Primary):**
    *   Located in the project root directory.
    *   Stores most configuration settings: AI model selections (main, research, fallback), parameters (max tokens, temperature), logging level, default subtasks/priority, project name, etc.
    *   **Managed via `task-master models --setup` command.** Do not edit manually unless you know what you are doing.
    *   **View/Set specific models via `task-master models` command or `models` MCP tool.**
    *   Created automatically when you run `task-master models --setup` for the first time.

2.  **Environment Variables (`.env` / `mcp.json`):**
    *   Used **only** for sensitive API keys and specific endpoint URLs.
    *   Place API keys (one per provider) in a `.env` file in the project root for CLI usage.
    *   For MCP/Cursor integration, configure these keys in the `env` section of `.cursor/mcp.json`.
    *   Available keys/variables: See `assets/env.example` or the Configuration section in the command reference (previously linked to `taskmaster.mdc`).

**Important:** Non-API key settings (like model selections, `MAX_TOKENS`, `TASKMASTER_LOG_LEVEL`) are **no longer configured via environment variables**. Use the `task-master models` command (or `--setup` for interactive configuration) or the `models` MCP tool.
**If AI commands FAIL in MCP** verify that the API key for the selected provider is present in the `env` section of `.cursor/mcp.json`.
**If AI commands FAIL in CLI** verify that the API key for the selected provider is present in the `.env` file in the root of the project.

## Determining the Next Task

- Run `next_task` / `task-master next` to show the next task to work on.
- The command identifies tasks with all dependencies satisfied
- Tasks are prioritized by priority level, dependency count, and ID
- The command shows comprehensive task information including:
    - Basic task details and description
    - Implementation details
    - Subtasks (if they exist)
    - Contextual suggested actions
- Recommended before starting any new development work
- Respects your project's dependency structure
- Ensures tasks are completed in the appropriate sequence
- Provides ready-to-use commands for common task actions

## Viewing Specific Task Details

- Run `get_task` / `task-master show <id>` to view a specific task.
- Use dot notation for subtasks: `task-master show 1.2` (shows subtask 2 of task 1)
- Displays comprehensive information similar to the next command, but for a specific task
- For parent tasks, shows all subtasks and their current status
- For subtasks, shows parent task information and relationship
- Provides contextual suggested actions appropriate for the specific task
- Useful for examining task details before implementation or checking status

## Managing Task Dependencies

- Use `add_dependency` / `task-master add-dependency --id=<id> --depends-on=<id>` to add a dependency.
- Use `remove_dependency` / `task-master remove-dependency --id=<id> --depends-on=<id>` to remove a dependency.
- The system prevents circular dependencies and duplicate dependency entries
- Dependencies are checked for existence before being added or removed
- Task files are automatically regenerated after dependency changes
- Dependencies are visualized with status indicators in task listings and files

## Task Reorganization

- Use `move_task` / `task-master move --from=<id> --to=<id>` to move tasks or subtasks within the hierarchy
- This command supports several use cases:
  - Moving a standalone task to become a subtask (e.g., `--from=5 --to=7`)
  - Moving a subtask to become a standalone task (e.g., `--from=5.2 --to=7`) 
  - Moving a subtask to a different parent (e.g., `--from=5.2 --to=7.3`)
  - Reordering subtasks within the same parent (e.g., `--from=5.2 --to=5.4`)
  - Moving a task to a new, non-existent ID position (e.g., `--from=5 --to=25`)
  - Moving multiple tasks at once using comma-separated IDs (e.g., `--from=10,11,12 --to=16,17,18`)
- The system includes validation to prevent data loss:
  - Allows moving to non-existent IDs by creating placeholder tasks
  - Prevents moving to existing task IDs that have content (to avoid overwriting)
  - Validates source tasks exist before attempting to move them
- The system maintains proper parent-child relationships and dependency integrity
- Task files are automatically regenerated after the move operation
- This provides greater flexibility in organizing and refining your task structure as project understanding evolves
- This is especially useful when dealing with potential merge conflicts arising from teams creating tasks on separate branches. Solve these conflicts very easily by moving your tasks and keeping theirs.

## Iterative Subtask Implementation

Once a task has been broken down into subtasks using `expand_task` or similar methods, follow this iterative process for implementation:

1.  **Understand the Goal (Preparation):**
    *   Use `get_task` / `task-master show <subtaskId>` (see [`taskmaster.mdc`](mdc:.cursor/rules/taskmaster.mdc)) to thoroughly understand the specific goals and requirements of the subtask.

2.  **Initial Exploration & Planning (Iteration 1):**
    *   This is the first attempt at creating a concrete implementation plan.
    *   Explore the codebase to identify the precise files, functions, and even specific lines of code that will need modification.
    *   Determine the intended code changes (diffs) and their locations.
    *   Gather *all* relevant details from this exploration phase.

3.  **Log the Plan:**
    *   Run `update_subtask` / `task-master update-subtask --id=<subtaskId> --prompt='<detailed plan>'`.
    *   Provide the *complete and detailed* findings from the exploration phase in the prompt. Include file paths, line numbers, proposed diffs, reasoning, and any potential challenges identified. Do not omit details. The goal is to create a rich, timestamped log within the subtask's `details`.

4.  **Verify the Plan:**
    *   Run `get_task` / `task-master show <subtaskId>` again to confirm that the detailed implementation plan has been successfully appended to the subtask's details.

5.  **Begin Implementation:**
    *   Set the subtask status using `set_task_status` / `task-master set-status --id=<subtaskId> --status=in-progress`.
    *   Start coding based on the logged plan.

6.  **Refine and Log Progress (Iteration 2+):**
    *   As implementation progresses, you will encounter challenges, discover nuances, or confirm successful approaches.
    *   **Before appending new information**: Briefly review the *existing* details logged in the subtask (using `get_task` or recalling from context) to ensure the update adds fresh insights and avoids redundancy.
    *   **Regularly** use `update_subtask` / `task-master update-subtask --id=<subtaskId> --prompt='<update details>\n- What worked...\n- What didn't work...'` to append new findings.
    *   **Crucially, log:**
        *   What worked ("fundamental truths" discovered).
        *   What didn't work and why (to avoid repeating mistakes).
        *   Specific code snippets or configurations that were successful.
        *   Decisions made, especially if confirmed with user input.
        *   Any deviations from the initial plan and the reasoning.
    *   The objective is to continuously enrich the subtask's details, creating a log of the implementation journey that helps the AI (and human developers) learn, adapt, and avoid repeating errors.

7.  **Review & Update Rules (Post-Implementation):**
    *   Once the implementation for the subtask is functionally complete, review all code changes and the relevant chat history.
    *   Identify any new or modified code patterns, conventions, or best practices established during the implementation.
    *   Create new or update existing rules following internal guidelines (previously linked to `cursor_rules.mdc` and `self_improve.mdc`).

8.  **Mark Task Complete:**
    *   After verifying the implementation and updating any necessary rules, mark the subtask as completed: `set_task_status` / `task-master set-status --id=<subtaskId> --status=done`.

9.  **Commit Changes (If using Git):**
    *   Stage the relevant code changes and any updated/new rule files (`git add .`).
    *   Craft a comprehensive Git commit message summarizing the work done for the subtask, including both code implementation and any rule adjustments.
    *   Execute the commit command directly in the terminal (e.g., `git commit -m 'feat(module): Implement feature X for subtask <subtaskId>\n\n- Details about changes...\n- Updated rule Y for pattern Z'`).
    *   Consider if a Changeset is needed according to internal versioning guidelines (previously linked to `changeset.mdc`). If so, run `npm run changeset`, stage the generated file, and amend the commit or create a new one.

10. **Proceed to Next Subtask:**
    *   Identify the next subtask (e.g., using `next_task` / `task-master next`).

## Code Analysis & Refactoring Techniques

- **Top-Level Function Search**:
    - Useful for understanding module structure or planning refactors.
    - Use grep/ripgrep to find exported functions/constants:
      `rg "export (async function|function|const) \w+"` or similar patterns.
    - Can help compare functions between files during migrations or identify potential naming conflicts.

---
*This workflow provides a general guideline. Adapt it based on your specific project needs and team practices.*
