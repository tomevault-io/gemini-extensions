# Off Grid Console — developer guide

Next.js 15 app. The AI gateway runs separately (the LiteLLM proxy at `<control-plane-host>:4000` on-prem).

## Engineering standards (non-negotiable)

- **SOLID + clear abstraction layers.** Isolate pure policy/logic from I/O (see `src/lib/tenancy-policy.ts` — a zero-import, unit-testable rule — vs `tenancy.ts`, its session/claims adapters). Business logic in `src/lib`, thin route handlers, swappable backends behind `src/lib/adapters`. Full rules: `docs/ENGINEERING.md`.
- **Write unit AND integration tests.** Tests live in `test/`, run with `npm test` (`node --test`, type-stripped). Unit-test the pure logic; integration-test the real wiring.
- **Use mocks very sparingly** — prefer exercising real functionality (real functions, real DB/services where feasible) so tests don't hide underlying behavior. If you're mocking a lot, the code probably needs a cleaner seam instead.
- **DRY — no copy-paste logic.** One rule lives in one place (a pure helper in `src/lib`), reused; if two surfaces need the same decision, extract it, don't duplicate it. Duplicated logic that drifts is a defect — we review for it.
- **Coverage bar (≥85%, enforced): branches, statements, lines, functions, and conditions must each be ≥85%** on the unit-testable logic layer (`src/lib` pure logic + adapters' pure paths). Measured with `npm run coverage` (c8); **enforced by the pre-push hook** (`npm run coverage:check`, `check-coverage: true`) — a push below the bar is blocked. Conditions are covered via branch coverage (each `&&`/`||`/`?:` arm exercised both ways — c8's branch metric; true MC/DC isn't a standard JS metric). Pure-I/O glue that genuinely needs live services (DB/network clients, worker entrypoints, React `.tsx`) is excluded from the denominator and verified by integration tests + build + vision instead — coverage thresholds apply to logic you can unit-test, not to glue. **Every change adds real tests; the bar only goes up.** SOLID's pure-logic-isolated-from-IO split is what makes this reachable — a file that's hard to cover usually needs a cleaner seam.
- **Navigation must live in the URL / history stack.** Every screen change or in-page navigation (opening a folder, a tab, a detail view, a modal that's a "place") MUST push a corresponding history entry — drive it from the route/`searchParams` (`useRouter`/`useSearchParams`), not local `useState`. This keeps the browser Back button coherent (Back steps out of a folder/tab, doesn't dump you off the page) and makes views deep-linkable/shareable. Client-only state for a navigational position is a bug.
- **Every module is a full CRUD management surface — not a read-only dashboard.** The console is how operators **run and maintain their systems**, so each module must let them **create, read, update, AND delete** the entities it covers, and **trigger the actions** that manage the underlying system (run an eval, run/schedule a backup, re-run/cancel an agent run, push/reload a policy, create/delete a collection, write a secret, edit a masking rule). A page that only lists/aggregates data is **the bare minimum and NOT a finished feature.** For each entity: create/edit forms with validation, delete with confirmation, proper error handling, and the write routes (POST/PATCH/DELETE) behind them — console-owned entities in the DB, external-service entities pushed through the service's API. Keep the SOLID split (pure rules in `src/lib`, thin routes, tests), but the deliverable is a working management console, end-to-end usable.

## Systems of record — READ THESE (don't keep infra knowledge in your head)

> **On-prem / fleet deployment orchestration now lives in the PRIVATE repo
> [`off-grid-ai/onprem-fleet-orchestration`](https://github.com/off-grid-ai/onprem-fleet-orchestration)**, not
> in this (public-bound) repo. The specific-deployment systems of record — `SERVER_STATE.md`,
> `SERVICE_MAP.md`, `DEPLOY.md`, the Cloudflare tunnel config, `dns-records.sh`, seed SQL, and the
> deploy scripts (`push.sh`/`fleet.sh`/`prod.sh`/`verify-integration.sh`) — were moved there. Clone
> that repo alongside this one to deploy or change infra.

Every out-of-code change to the on-prem deployment MUST be captured in one of those records (in the
private repo), in the same commit that makes the change — otherwise it's lost when the session ends.
Generic self-host tooling that stays in THIS repo: `deploy/docker-compose*.yml`, `deploy/Makefile`,
`deploy/keycloak/`, `deploy/openbao/`, `deploy/sidecars/`, `deploy/README.md`.

**`docs/ROADMAP.md`** — phases + milestones. **`docs/ENGINEERING.md`** — SOLID / ports-and-adapters rules.

## Dev

```bash
npm run dev          # start dev server
npm run build        # production build
npm run typecheck    # tsc --noEmit
npm run db:push      # push schema changes
npm run smoke        # hit each service health endpoint
```

Infra (Postgres, OpenBao, Redis, etc.) lives in `deploy/`. Start what you need:

```bash
cd deploy && make up           # full stack
cd deploy && make data         # Postgres + SeaweedFS only
cd deploy && make secrets      # OpenBao only
```

## Deploying to the on-prem fleet

**Full runbook: [`deploy/DEPLOY.md`](deploy/DEPLOY.md) — read it before deploying.**

```bash
./deploy/push.sh          # from YOUR Mac: rsync source + @offgrid pkgs, build, restart
```

Two traps that make a deploy silently no-op (both handled by `push.sh`, documented in DEPLOY.md):

1. **`git` is dead on the SERVER** (no Xcode CLT) — `git pull` fails silently, code stays stale. Deploy via rsync, not git.
2. **`shared/` monorepo isn't on the server** — the `@offgrid/*` file: deps must be rsync'd or the build fails with "Module not found".

Other essentials:

- The console runs **natively** (`next start` on `:3000`), **no pm2**. Restart = `pkill -f next-server` then relaunch.
- Non-interactive SSH has a minimal PATH — always call node by absolute path (`/usr/local/bin/node node_modules/.bin/next`).
- `drizzle-kit push` hangs over SSH; apply schema changes with the `pg` client directly (see DEPLOY.md § Database migrations).
- Runtime config is `.env.local` / `.env.production` **on the server** — not in git, never overwritten by deploy.

### Deployment scope: ship the product change, not the demo fleet

The eight-node on-prem estate is a cost-controlled demo/integration fixture. Its topology is **not**
the product deliverable. For capability work, deep verification means proving the complete user
journey and its required boundaries on the live fixture; it does not mean re-certifying or
redeploying every composable service.

- **App/Console-only change:** deploy the Console artifact and only its affected Console workers via
  the private repo's `deploy/push.sh`. Verify the changed UI/API/workflow plus the specific dependency
  it uses.
- **Database schema change:** take the required backup, apply the checked-in migration, deploy the
  matching Console release, and verify the migration invariants. Do not run a migration when the
  schema did not change.
- **Composable service change:** deploy/recreate that service only when its own implementation,
  configuration, image, or contract changed, or when targeted product verification proves the
  required dependency is absent/broken. Preserve volumes and use the narrow service runbook.
- **Broad fleet recovery:** never the default follow-up to a capability release. Run it only for an
  explicit fleet/recovery task or when targeted verification identifies a fleet-wide dependency
  problem. A broad topology sweep is not evidence that the product capability works.

Prioritize evidence in this order: non-technical user journey → product state/effects → governance,
receipt, audit, and replay guarantees → targeted dependency health. Stop when those gates are proven;
do not expand verification into unrelated infrastructure.

## Production hardening

**Local hardening/verify script:** `deploy/prod.sh`

```bash
./deploy/prod.sh          # build + start
./deploy/prod.sh start    # start only (skip build)
./deploy/prod.sh verify   # smoke-test headers, dev-login, rate limiter
```

**Before running in production:**

1. Fill in `.env.production` — copy `.env.local`, then:
   - Replace `DATABASE_URL` password (not `offgrid:offgrid`)
   - Add Keycloak env vars (see below)
   - `AUTH_DEV_LOGIN=false` is already set — do not change it
   - `AUTH_URL` is not needed — `AUTH_TRUST_HOST=true` handles it via Cloudflare headers
2. Set up Cloudflare Access on your tunnel subdomain (free tier, email OTP)
3. Run `./deploy/prod.sh verify` after starting to confirm headers + rate limiter are live

**What hardening is in place:**

- Security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.) — `next.config.mjs`
- Rate limiter 60 req/min per IP on `/api/*` — `src/middleware.ts`
- Dev login disabled via `AUTH_DEV_LOGIN=false` in `.env.production`
- Admin token rotated from dev default in `.env.production`

## Auth

NextAuth v5. Providers activate based on env vars — Google, Microsoft Entra, Keycloak, or dev credentials (dev only, never in production). See `src/auth.config.ts`.

Service accounts use `Authorization: Bearer <OFFGRID_ADMIN_TOKEN>` — middleware passes these through to handler-level verification.

## Design

Inherit the shared Off Grid design philosophy from `../brand/DESIGN_PHILOSOPHY.md` (the source of truth — brutalist/terminal, Menlo mono, emerald accent, tokens in `@offgrid/design`). Platform specifics: this repo has no separate design doc yet — follow the shared philosophy and the tokens directly.

### Use the full width — no wasted real estate (NON-NEGOTIABLE, applies to EVERY page)

This is a desktop-first operator console on wide (≥1440px) screens. **Content must fill the available width.** The single most repeated piece of design feedback here is "wasted real estate / not desktop-optimised" — do NOT reintroduce it.

- **Never wrap a full PAGE in `mx-auto max-w-2xl/3xl/4xl`.** That centers content in a skinny column and leaves 30–50% of a wide screen empty. Page shells fill the width (the console `<main>` already pads with `p-6`); a page's root should be full-width (`w-full`, or at most `max-w-7xl`/`max-w-[110rem]` for the very widest surfaces).
- **Lay out with responsive grids/columns**, not one tall centered stack: `grid gap-4 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 xl:grid-cols-4`. Card lists are grids. A form + its help/preview sit side-by-side on `lg+`, not stacked in a narrow column. Stat rows are multi-column bands.
- **The ONLY thing that stays narrow is a single reading/measure column** — long prose, or one focused input (a chat composer, a single textarea) — cap those at ~`max-w-2xl`/`prose` _inside_ a full-width page, never by centering the whole page.
- Still responsive: columns stack on narrow/tablet; wide tables/diagrams scroll inside their own `overflow-x-auto`, the page body never scrolls horizontally.
- Verify against a wide viewport: if a full-page surface leaves a large empty gutter on either side, it's a bug — fix it before calling the work done.

### List → detail everywhere (default IA for every entity collection)

A list is a way _in_, not the whole story. **Wherever the console shows a collection of entities, an item should open a real, deep-linkable DETAIL view** — its own route/URL (`/thing/[id]`), not a flat table row you can't drill into and not a cramped modal for something that's actually a "place." Apply this as much as possible.

- **Master → detail.** Row/card click → a dedicated detail page showing the full entity + all its actions (edit, delete, the entity's sub-resources, its history/runs, related items). The per-app lifecycle shell (`/apps/[id]` with Build/Input/Runs/Review/Reports) and the project detail page are the reference pattern — generalize it.
- **URL-driven** (per the nav rule): the detail is a route, shareable and Back-coherent — never client-only `useState` for "which item is open."
- A **modal/side-panel is fine for a quick create/edit form**, but not as the only way to see an entity that has depth. If it has sub-resources, status over time, or its own actions, it's a detail _page_.
- When you build or touch a list surface, give it (or wire it to) a detail view. A pure list/table with nowhere to click through is the bare minimum, not finished — same bar as the full-CRUD rule above.

## Multi-agent operating model (how we build here)

Substantial work is executed by a fleet of parallel subagents orchestrated by the main session — not one linear thread. The standard:

For service inventory, integration, capability exposure, or fleet verification work, every agent must
first follow [`docs/SERVICE_EXPANSION_AGENT_BRIEF.md`](docs/SERVICE_EXPANSION_AGENT_BRIEF.md). It is the
single shared prompt for the 48-entry ontology, four verification gates, evidence contract, systems of
record, and parallel file ownership. Agent-specific prompts should name only the assigned family,
owned file set, and deliverable; they must not independently rediscover or redefine this contract.

- **Parallel workers, 3 at a time.** Decompose work into worktree-isolated subagents that run concurrently in a rolling window of ~3, each on a DISJOINT file-set so they never merge-conflict. As each lands: review against the engineering standards, merge, run a **local production build gate** (typecheck + tests do NOT catch build/route errors — build before deploy), deploy, verify, then launch the next from the backlog. One agent owns nav/shared-file changes per round; the others avoid them.
- **Commit early, commit often — never lose progress (MANDATORY for every agent).** A worktree branch's commits are the ONLY durable record if a session hits its limit or an agent dies mid-run (uncommitted working-tree changes are lost; committed ones survive on disk and can be merged next session). So each agent MUST make **small, meaningful, incremental commits as it goes** — after each coherent unit (a pure module + its test, a wired route, a fixed file) — NOT one big commit at the end, and NEVER leave a large uncommitted working tree while continuing to work. Commit WIP with a clear message rather than risk losing it; the gates run at merge, not per-commit, so frequent commits are free. The orchestrator, in turn, **merges + pushes each landed branch to the remote promptly** (the remote is the real backup) and does not batch many agents' work into one late push.
- **The gap agent.** Any gap, regression, or "not fully done" is logged to the repo's gaps doc (`docs/GAPS_BACKLOG.md`). A standing gap agent is woken whenever there are gaps: it picks them up, closes them, and marks them resolved with evidence. Gaps are surfaced honestly, never hidden.
- **The QA / platform-integration + docs sweep agent.** After every 3 agent completions, run a sweep agent that (a) verifies the whole platform integrates and works end-to-end (run the integration harness + exercise real cross-service/-surface flows), (b) surfaces any new gaps into the gaps doc, and (c) writes/updates USER-FACING documentation live — how to use / what to do / why / when, per surface — so docs stay current with the build.
- **Merge gate (every merge, non-negotiable):** SOLID + pure logic isolated (unit-testable, zero-IO) separated from I/O; **DRY (no duplicated logic)**; thin handlers; REAL tests exercising real behavior (mocks sparingly); **coverage ≥85% on all of branches/statements/lines/functions/conditions (`npm run coverage:check`, enforced by the pre-push hook)**; typecheck clean; tests pass; a clean local production build; verify UI by screenshot (vision) and integration by the harness. Nothing is "done" until VERIFIED live, not merely merged.
- **Honesty bar:** report status as a gate (code / wired / verified), never inflate "done." A premature "complete" is a defect.
