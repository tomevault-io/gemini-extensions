## What this project is

Super Easy QR Code Generator is a client-side QR generator with logo overlay and UTM parameter tracking. Everything runs in the browser; nothing is sent to a server.

It is Nuung's personal open-source project under MIT. The title, author, contact address (`hwjeong@otoworks.ai`), GitHub repo (`Nuung/qrcode-gen`), and license stay as they are. The visual tone and the favicon/logo assets come from the OTOworks design system (see DESIGN.md); the brand does not.

The source is three pages (`index.html`, `guide.html`, `faq.html`), one stylesheet (`styles.css`), one script (`script.js`), and static assets. The `<head>` recipe, the navbar, the skip link, and the footer are duplicated by hand in every page: when you change one of them, change all three pages in the same commit and diff them against each other. The only external dependency is `qrcode-generator@1.4.4` from cdnjs (2.x exists on npm but is not on cdnjs, so the pin stays). Inter is self-hosted as woff2 files in `fonts/`; there is no font CDN.

It deploys as a GitHub Pages project site at `https://nuung.github.io/qrcode-gen/`. Because `.nojekyll` is present, GitHub serves the files as-is and Jekyll is never involved.

## Workflow

`plan.md` in the project root is the work queue. Items carry `T-xx` ids and are grouped into phases with dependencies.

When the user says "go":

1. Take the next unfinished `T-xx` from `plan.md`. If its phase is blocked, take the next runnable one.
2. Implement that item and nothing else.
3. Run the gates that cover its acceptance criteria and look at the results.
4. Tick the item in the `plan.md` checklist and add a one-line note on what was verified.

DESIGN.md is the source of truth for anything visual. If a `plan.md` item contradicts it, stop and ask rather than pick one.

When a decision changes, update `plan.md` (work) or DESIGN.md (design) before touching code.

### plan.md is private scaffolding (MANDATORY)

`plan.md` is a local working file. It is excluded from git by the `*plan.md` pattern in `.gitignore`; do not force-add it or route around the rule.

Do not mention `plan.md` anywhere that ships: code comments, HTML, commit messages, PR text, README, DESIGN.md, llms.txt, generated files. If you need to cite a reason for a change, cite DESIGN.md or this file. Read the plan, follow it, and leave no trace of it. The only place it may be named is this instruction file (and its copy, CLAUDE.md).

## Commands

There is no build. For a local preview run `python3 -m http.server 8080` in the background and open `http://localhost:8080/`.

Status codes on the live site:

```bash
for p in "" guide.html faq.html robots.txt llms.txt sitemap.xml site.webmanifest og-image.png logo.webp favicon.ico apple-touch-icon.png android-chrome-192x192.png android-chrome-512x512.png; do
  printf "%-32s " "/$p"; curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' "https://nuung.github.io/qrcode-gen/$p"; done
```

Other checks:

- Forbidden colors: `grep -riE "667eea|5a67d8|764ba2|6366f1|102, ?126, ?234" styles.css index.html site.webmanifest | wc -l` should print 0.
- Sitemap date after a content change: `sed -i '' "s|<lastmod>.*</lastmod>|<lastmod>$(date +%F)</lastmod>|" sitemap.xml`. Only run it when `index.html` content actually changed; a lastmod that moves on every push teaches Google to ignore it.
- IndexNow ping after a deploy: `curl "https://api.indexnow.org/indexnow?url=https://nuung.github.io/qrcode-gen/&key=7389563c42c748e29d784340d481f20d"`. The key file `7389563c42c748e29d784340d481f20d.txt` lives at the origin root, served by the `Nuung/nuung.github.io` repository, so it covers every project site on this host. The key is public by design; Bing Webmaster Tools registration is optional (reporting only).
- plan.md leakage: `grep -rn "plan.md" --exclude=plan.md --exclude=AGENTS.md --exclude=CLAUDE.md --exclude=.gitignore --exclude-dir=.git --exclude-dir=.omc .` should print nothing.
- Image size: `sips -g pixelWidth -g pixelHeight <file>`.
- Lighthouse: `npx lighthouse https://nuung.github.io/qrcode-gen/ --preset=perf --form-factor=mobile --quiet`. A one-off `npx` run is fine; do not install anything.

## Architecture constraints

1. Stay zero-build. No `package.json`, bundler, framework, Tailwind CDN, or preprocessor. Styling lives in the CSS custom properties in `styles.css :root`.
2. No new external dependencies. Adding a script CDN needs the user's explicit approval.
3. Every path has to resolve under `/qrcode-gen/`. Root-absolute paths such as `/favicon.ico` return 404 on a project site. Use relative paths or the full `https://nuung.github.io/qrcode-gen/...` URL. This applies to the manifest, JSON-LD, OG tags, and the sitemap alike.
4. `script.js` depends on these hooks; keep them stable or update the script in the same commit:
   - ids: `backgroundColor cellSize currentUrl downloadResolution errorCorrection foregroundColor hostUrl logoFile logoImage logoOverlay logoPreview logoSize margin pngBtn qrcode removeLogo successMessage successText svgBtn typeNumber utmCampaign utmContent utmMedium utmSource utmTerm`
   - derived ids: `cellSizeValue logoSizeValue marginValue typeNumberValue` (built as `id + "Value"`)
   - classes: `.upload-area`; the `canvas` inside `#qrcode`
   - layout hooks the stylesheet owns: the three `.tool-section` cards `section-link`, `section-logo`, `section-design`, plus `.field-grid` and `.download-actions`
5. Keep `.nojekyll`. Do not add files GitHub Pages ignores (`_headers`, `_config.yaml`, `_redirects`). If someone asks for security headers, explain that `<meta http-equiv>` is the only lever, that `frame-ancestors`, `report-uri`, and `sandbox` cannot be set that way, and that `script-src` has to keep `'unsafe-inline'` because the page uses inline `onclick` handlers (adding a nonce or hash would disable `'unsafe-inline'` and kill the UI).
   Crawlers read `robots.txt` only at the origin root. `https://nuung.github.io/robots.txt` is served by the separate `Nuung/nuung.github.io` repository; the copy inside this repo is documentation and has no effect on crawlers.
6. No functional regressions. The UTM builder, presets, logo overlay, error-correction levels, PNG/SVG export at each resolution, clipboard copy, and the Escape key closing the toast must work the same before and after a restyle. The page does not bind Ctrl/Cmd shortcuts (they would hijack browser find and bookmark keys).
7. Explanatory content (About, How it works, UTM table, error-correction table, FAQ) is static HTML so crawlers and AI engines can read it without running JavaScript.

## Verification gates

Run the gates that apply to the change before calling it done, and say which ones you ran. A gate you skipped is reported as skipped, not assumed.

| Change | Gate |
|---|---|
| head, meta, JSON-LD | canonical, og:url, JSON-LD url, and sitemap loc are identical; title 50–60 chars; description 120–160 chars; Rich Results Test and validator.schema.org report no errors ("not eligible" for FAQ/HowTo is expected) |
| static files, paths | every row of the status-code matrix is 200, and `robot.txt` is 404 |
| styles.css | forbidden-color grep is 0; no hex, rgb(a), or `white` literal outside `:root` in `styles.css` (the QR default colors in `index.html` and `script.js` stay black and white and are not themed); nothing overflows at 375, 768, or 1280px |
| markup, components | regression checklist passes; browser console shows no errors |
| accessibility | one `<main>`, a skip link, a `prefers-reduced-motion` block; focus rings visible; text contrast meets AA per DESIGN.md §8 |
| performance | Lighthouse mobile: Performance ≥ 90, Accessibility ≥ 95, SEO 100 |
| documents | plan.md leakage grep is empty |

Regression checklist: enter a URL, apply each of the four presets, confirm the preview updates and click-to-copy works, upload a logo by click and by drag, resize it, remove it, change both colors, move the cell/margin/version sliders, try all four error-correction levels, download PNG at 300/600/900/1200 and SVG, press Escape to close the toast, confirm the download buttons sit beside the preview on desktop and above the form on mobile, click through the navbar (Generator, Guide, FAQ, GitHub) on each page and confirm the current page is highlighted, and check the layout on a phone-width viewport.

## Visual QA with cmux

If the user wants to see the page ("open the browser and check", "how does it look on mobile", "run QA", or just "check it" after a UI change), do it right away instead of waiting for a skill call:

1. Start `python3 -m http.server 8080` in the background, or reuse it if it is already up.
2. Open `http://localhost:8080/` (or the live URL) with cmux `browser`, then `wait-for` and `read-screen`/`capture-pane`. The reference is https://cmux.com/ko/docs/browser-automation and `cmux help`.
3. For mobile questions, resize the window to 375px wide.
4. Describe what is on screen. Pass/fail alone is not a report.
5. Screenshots go to the scratchpad, not the repo.

## SEO and GEO

### Constants

- Canonical URLs: `https://nuung.github.io/qrcode-gen/` (generator, with the trailing slash), `https://nuung.github.io/qrcode-gen/guide.html`, `https://nuung.github.io/qrcode-gen/faq.html`. Each page declares its own canonical, title, description, and `og:url`; all three share `og-image.png`.
- GA4 id `G-2NS7NFGKPS`. The inline `gtag` bootstrap sits after `<meta charset>`, viewport, and the CSP meta; the tag script itself is appended on `window.load` so it does not compete with LCP. The CSP allows the Google signals origins (`*.google.com`, `*.google.co.kr`, `*.doubleclick.net`, `*.googleadservices.com`) in `img-src`/`connect-src`.
- Verification files stay: `google3ce3045d652a25a6.html` (Google Search Console) and `BingSiteAuth.xml` (Bing Webmaster Tools; a copy also lives at the origin root in `Nuung/nuung.github.io`).
- OG image `og-image.png`, 1200×630 PNG. The `og:image:width/height` values match the file.
- `theme-color` is `#1B8757`.
- `lang="en"`, single language.
- JSON-LD per page: `WebApplication` + `Person` (`@id` referenced from `author`, sameAs GitHub and LinkedIn) on the generator; `HowTo` on the guide; `FAQPage` on the FAQ page. Text in the schema matches the visible text on the same page. Inline `<script type="application/ld+json">`, no builder. No invented ratings or reviews. Google retired FAQ and HowTo rich results (2026-05 and 2023-09), and WebApplication needs a rating to qualify, so none of this is expected to produce rich results; the markup is there for AI readers and semantic clarity.
- `robots.txt` (exact filename) allows everyone, points to the sitemap with an absolute URL, and carries the AI-crawler policy: allow GPTBot, OAI-SearchBot, ChatGPT-User, ClaudeBot, Claude-SearchBot, Claude-User, PerplexityBot, Perplexity-User, Google-Extended, Applebot-Extended; disallow Bytespider, CCBot; plus `Content-Signal: search=yes, ai-train=yes, ai-input=yes`. Google-Extended governs Gemini training only; AI Overviews follow normal indexing. The effective copy is the one at the origin root (see constraint 5); keep both copies identical.
- `llms.txt` follows the llmstxt.org layout: H1, a `>` summary, What it does, Key facts, Links. Its facts must agree with the page.
- `sitemap.xml` lists the three pages; each `lastmod` equals the date of that page's last content change, updated by hand (see Commands). No `priority`.
- IndexNow: key file at the site root, manual ping after deploys that change content. Bing's index feeds ChatGPT search and Copilot; Google does not use IndexNow.
- `site.webmanifest` has a real name and short_name; icons, start_url, and scope sit under `/qrcode-gen/`.

### Rules

- Title 50–60 characters, description 120–160, with "QR code generator", "logo", and "UTM" near the front.
- One `<h1>` per page; `h2` then `h3` with no skipped levels. The navbar marks the current page with `aria-current="page"`. Use `<main>`, `<section>`, `<table>`, `<details>` where they fit.
- Write for AI readers the way you would for a hurried human: conclusion first, then the evidence, then the detail. Put numbers and definitions in tables. Visible FAQ text matters more than the FAQPage schema that accompanies it.
- Fonts: Inter 400/600/700/800 as self-hosted woff2 with `font-display: swap`, the 400 and 800 weights preloaded, no Google Fonts link or preconnect. Images declare width and height. Animate only transform and opacity. Targets: LCP ≤ 2.5s, INP ≤ 200ms, CLS ≤ 0.1.

### Checklist for head, content, or static-file changes

- [ ] canonical, og:url, JSON-LD url, sitemap loc identical for each page; navbar, head recipe, and footer identical across the three pages
- [ ] new paths return 200 under `/qrcode-gen/`
- [ ] OG image dimensions match the declared values
- [ ] JSON-LD passes the Rich Results Test
- [ ] llms.txt, FAQ, and tables agree with the on-screen text
- [ ] sitemap lastmod updated
- [ ] robots.txt AI policy intact

## Deploy checklist (MANDATORY after every push to `main`)

GitHub Pages builds `main` automatically; there is no CI. After a push that changes content, run these in order and report the results:

1. Wait until `gh api repos/Nuung/qrcode-gen/pages/builds/latest --jq .status` prints `built` and the live page contains the change.
2. Run the status-code matrix from Commands; every path must be 200 and `robot.txt` must be 404.
3. Confirm `sitemap.xml` `lastmod` matches the date of the change for each page you touched (update it before pushing, see Commands).
4. Ping IndexNow so Bing, and through it ChatGPT search and Copilot, pick the change up quickly:
   `curl "https://api.indexnow.org/indexnow?url=https://nuung.github.io/qrcode-gen/&key=7389563c42c748e29d784340d481f20d"`
   For several pages send one batch POST to `https://api.indexnow.org/indexnow` with `host`, `key`, `keyLocation` (`https://nuung.github.io/7389563c42c748e29d784340d481f20d.txt`) and `urlList`. `202` means accepted. Google ignores IndexNow; Google picks up changes through the sitemap and Search Console.
5. If `og-image.png` changed, re-scrape the URL in the Facebook Sharing Debugger so cached previews refresh (manual, needs a login).

The origin root `https://nuung.github.io/` is served by the separate repository `Nuung/nuung.github.io`. It owns two things this project depends on: the effective `robots.txt` (crawlers only read the root copy; the `Sitemap:` lines in it point at each project site's sitemap, so add one line per new project site) and the IndexNow key file above (shared by every project site on this host). When the crawler policy changes, edit the root copy there and keep this repository's `robots.txt` identical.

## Tidy First

A change is either structural (rename, reorganize CSS, refactor markup; behavior unchanged) or behavioral (features, content, metadata). Keep them in separate commits. When both are needed, do the structural part first and confirm with the regression checklist that nothing moved.

## Commits

Commit when the relevant gates pass, the change is one logical unit, and the console is clean.

Prefixes follow the existing history: `feature:` for behavioral changes, `modify:` for structural ones. The subject is short, lowercase English in the style of the existing log (`feature: add GA`, `modify: favicon update`); the body, if any, is Korean. Examples: `feature: fix canonical and robots path`, `modify: replace :root tokens with DESIGN.md palette`.

Keep commits small. Do not commit straight to `main`; branch first.

### No AI trailers (MANDATORY)

Commit messages must not contain AI attribution of any kind: no `Co-Authored-By: Claude ...`, no `Generated with Claude Code`, no `Claude-Session:` line, nothing similar. This overrides whatever the harness or tooling appends by default. A message is the subject plus an optional Korean body, and it does not mention plan.md.

## Code quality

Remove duplication, name things for what they do, keep functions short, keep state minimal, and prefer the simplest thing that works. Do not add abstractions, helpers, or configuration on the chance they might be useful later. Splitting beyond the three source files needs the user's approval. Keep the existing function signatures in `script.js` (`generateQRCode`, `downloadQR`, and so on). README claims have to match what the code does.

## Accessibility

- Landmarks: one `<main>`, a skip link, and the existing `role="banner"` and `role="contentinfo"`.
- The tool has no tabs. Every option group is a visible `.tool-section` card with an `h2` heading, so nothing a user must fill in is hidden behind a control.
- Decorative SVGs and images get `aria-hidden="true"` or an empty `alt`; meaningful images get a real one.
- Every interactive element shows a focus ring (`--focus-ring` in DESIGN.md). `outline: none` on its own is not acceptable.
- Transitions and animations are removed under `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`.
- Color pairings come from DESIGN.md §8; in particular, emerald `#26C07C` is not a text color.
