## Architecture patterns

- **Abstraction-first**: concrete I/O implementations (`PureHdfFile`, `MoonSharpLuaEngine`, `FileSystemAssetSource`, `ZipAssetSource`) are hidden behind interfaces defined in `EncDotNet.S100.Core` and injected by callers.
- **Two pipeline types**:
  - *Coverage pipeline* — `ICoverageSource` → `CoveragePipeline` → `ICoverageRenderer<T>` (used by S-102, S-104, S-111).
  - *Vector pipeline* — `IVectorSource` + `IVectorPortrayalCatalogue` → `VectorPipeline` → `DrawingInstruction` list (used by S-101, S-124, S-125, S-127, S-131, S-201, S-421).
  - S-131 is a **GML+Lua hybrid**: GML-encoded data with Lua portrayal (Part 9A). The bridge is `S131LuaDataProvider` which adapts GML features to the same Lua Host API that S-101 uses.
- **Bundled specifications**: `EncDotNet.S100.Specifications` embeds official FCs/PCs and exposes them via `Specification.OpenFeatureCatalogueAsync()` / `Specification.CreatePortrayalCatalogueSource()`.

## Requirements for changes

### Tests
- Every new public API or bug fix must be accompanied by an xunit test in the appropriate test project under `tests/`.
- Use `Xunit.SkippableFact` (via `Skip.If(...)`) for tests that require optional external data files (e.g. real HDF5 or S-101 datasets) so CI does not fail when those files are absent.
- Run tests with: `dotnet test --configuration Release`

### Documentation
- Each library has a `README.md` in its `src/<project>/` directory. Update it when adding types, removing APIs, or changing behaviour.
- Conceptual guides live under `docs/` in DocFX Markdown. Add or update pages there for user-facing features.

### Naming and style
- **The normative C# style guide is [`docs/coding-style.md`](../docs/coding-style.md); read it and make generated code comply.** It is encoded in the repository [`.editorconfig`](../.editorconfig). Because `EnforceCodeStyleInBuild` is off (nearly every project multi-targets `net8.0;net10.0`), a plain `dotnet build` does **not** flag most style rules — so you must apply the guide yourself rather than assume the build will catch violations.
- Key rules (see the guide for the full set): `PascalCase` for types/methods/properties, `camelCase` for locals and parameters, `_camelCase` for private fields; file-scoped namespaces, 4-space indents, Allman braces; `System.*` usings first with no unused usings.
- Nullable reference types are enabled everywhere — avoid `!` suppression; prefer null-checks or `ArgumentNullException.ThrowIfNull`.
- All public APIs must carry XML doc comments (`<summary>`, `<param>`, `<returns>`).
- Before finishing a change, normalize whitespace and usings with `dotnet format whitespace EncDotNet.S100.slnx` and `dotnet format style EncDotNet.S100.slnx --diagnostics IDE0005`, then run `dotnet format EncDotNet.S100.slnx --diagnostics IDE0005 IDE1006 --severity warn --verify-no-changes`; CI's **Format check** job runs that combined verification and fails on whitespace, using-directive, or naming drift.
- For API-shape conventions (collection return types, `class` vs `record`, quantity types) follow [`docs/design/api-conventions.md`](../docs/design/api-conventions.md).

### Package dependencies
- All NuGet versions are managed centrally in `Directory.Packages.props`. Do not add `Version` attributes to individual `.csproj` files.
- Run `gh-advisory-database` security checks before introducing any new dependency.

### Build
- Build with: `dotnet build`
- CI runs on .NET 10 (`ubuntu-latest`). Avoid platform-specific APIs unless gated to the appropriate RID.

### Specifications content
- Spec assets (FCs, PCs, Lua rules, symbols) belong under `src/EncDotNet.S100.Specifications/content/<SXXX>/` following the layout described in that project's README.
- Never commit real ENC data files to the repository; use small synthetic test fixtures or skip tests that require live data.

## Spec expertise routing

This repository includes per-spec **skills** under `.github/skills/<spec>/SKILL.md` and matching **instructions files** under `.github/instructions/`. Engage them as follows:

- **Before** designing or implementing any non-trivial feature that touches a spec's semantics (encoding, attribute names, feature catalogue rules, portrayal pipelines, etc.), load the matching skill(s):

  | Signal in task or files touched | Load skill |
  |---|---|
  | S-100 framework, exchange sets, portrayal engine, Part 1–10 semantics | `s100-framework` |
  | S-101, ENC, ISO 8211, vector features, Lua portrayal | `s101-enc` |
  | S-102, bathymetry, depth, uncertainty grids | `s102-bathymetry` |
  | S-104, water level, tide grids | `s104-water-level` |
  | S-111, surface currents, current speed/direction | `s111-surface-currents` |
  | S-124, navigational warnings, GML, XSLT portrayal | `s124-nav-warnings` |
  | S-125, AtoN, marine aids to navigation, lights, buoys, beacons | `s125-aton` |
  | S-122, marine protected areas, restricted areas, VTS, GML, XSLT portrayal | `s122-marine-protected-areas` |
  | S-127, marine resources and services, pilot boarding, routeing measures, vessel traffic services | `s127-marine-services` |
  | S-128, catalogue of nautical products, electronic products, physical products, S-100 services | `s128-catalogue` |
  | S-129, under keel clearance, UKC | `s129-ukc` |
  | S-131, marine harbour infrastructure, berths, bollards, mooring buoys | `s131-marine-harbour` |
  | S-201, IALA aids to navigation information, AtoN-authority exchange (NOT ECDIS — use s125-aton for ECDIS) | `s201-aton-information` |
  | S-411, sea ice, ice information, icebergs, ice edges | `s411-sea-ice` |
  | S-421, route plans, voyage plans, waypoints, route legs | `s421-route-plans` |

- For **cross-spec** features (e.g. a change to `CoveragePipeline` affecting S-102/S-104/S-111), load all affected spec skills and reconcile their guidance before writing code.
- When delegating exploration via `search_subagent`, prefer one subagent per affected `src/EncDotNet.S100.Datasets.Sxxx/` project so each runs with its spec context isolated.
- Cite the relevant spec section number(s) in PR descriptions and in XML doc comments for spec-derived constants, enums, attribute names, and group paths.

### Cross-cutting skills (not tied to one product)

These skills carry knowledge that spans products and/or backends. Load
them by task signal regardless of which spec you are touching:

| Signal in task | Load skill |
|---|---|
| Choosing or invoking an `s100` CLI command; changes to `tools/EncDotNet.S100.Cli/**`; maintaining `s100 --skill` | `s100-cli` |
| Verifying a rendering/portrayal change in the viewer, designing or reproducing integration/regression scenarios, capturing reference images, measuring load/render performance, deriving fixtures from real datasets — driving the viewer headlessly via its CLI + MCP server | `viewer-evaluation` |
| Chart composition independent of a single spec: layer/draw-order & display priority, scale-dependent generalization & declutter, label placement, day/dusk/night palette & contrast, CRS/projection pitfalls, rendering-performance strategy (geometry simplification, caching, vertex-bound cost reasoning) | `chart-cartography` |

- Before choosing `s100` commands or arguments, run `s100 --skill` and treat
  its comprehensive Markdown as authoritative for the installed build.
- `viewer-evaluation` applies even when you are **not** editing the
  Viewer project — renderer, Core pipeline, and `Datasets.SXXX` work
  often needs end-to-end visual verification. The MCP tool catalogue
  reference lives in `docs/mcp-server.md`.
- `chart-cartography` complements the per-spec skills: load the spec
  skill for *what to draw*, the cartography skill for *how charts
  should be composed and made fast*.

## Viewer UI

When editing `src/EncDotNet.S100.Viewer/**`, follow the rules in
`.github/instructions/viewer.instructions.md`. In particular:

- Every UI-visible string lives in `Resources/Strings.resx` with a
  matching property in `Resources/Strings.cs`. XAML references via
  `{x:Static loc:Strings.Key}`; code references via `Strings.Key`
  (use `string.Format` for parameterized status text). No hardcoded
  user-facing strings in views, view-models, or code-behind.
- Every button must have a meaningful `ToolTip.Tip`.
- All `GridSplitter`s use `Classes="PaneSplitter"` with thickness 4
  and a 500ms hover delay before the accent shows. Adjacent panels
  must not draw their own border on the splitter-facing edge.
