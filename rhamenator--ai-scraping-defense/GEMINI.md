## Development Workflow

### 1. Environment Setup

Before making changes:
```bash
# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install
```

### 2. Code Quality and Linting

**Always run pre-commit hooks on modified files:**
```bash
pre-commit run --files <file1> [file2 ...]
```

The project uses:
- **black**: Python code formatting (respects the max line length configured in the repository)
- **isort**: Import sorting
- **flake8**: Python linting (see `.flake8` for configuration including max line length)

Configuration files:
- `.flake8` - Flake8 settings
- `.isort.cfg` - Import sorting configuration
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml` - Pre-commit hook definitions

### 3. Testing

**Run tests before and after changes:**
```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest

# Run specific test file
python -m pytest test/path/to/test_file.py

# Run with coverage
python -m pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html
```

Test guidelines:
- Tests are located in `test/` directory, mirroring the `src/` structure
- Use pytest fixtures defined in `test/conftest.py`
- Write unit tests for new functionality
- Integration tests should use Docker Compose when needed
- Mock external services (LLMs, payment gateways, etc.) in tests

### 4. Building and Running Locally

```bash
# Build and start all services
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f [service_name]

# Stop services
docker-compose down
```

### 5. Commit Guidelines

- Use clear, descriptive commit messages in present tense
- Examples: `Add advanced header analysis`, `Fix rate limit daemon crash`, `Update architecture docs`
- Separate unrelated changes into different commits
- Reference issue numbers when applicable: `Fix #123: Resolve memory leak in escalation engine`

## Coding Standards and Best Practices

### Python Code

1. **Follow PEP 8** with these specifics:
   - Line length: Use the max line length configured in the repository's tooling (see `.flake8`, `pyproject.toml` (if present), or formatter-specific configs). Do not assume or hard-code a specif[...]
   - Use type hints for function signatures
   - Docstrings for public functions and classes

2. **FastAPI Services**:
   - Use async/await for I/O operations
   - Implement proper error handling with HTTPException
   - Use dependency injection for shared resources (Redis, DB connections)
   - Add Pydantic models for request/response validation

3. **Security**:
   - Never commit secrets or credentials
   - Use environment variables for configuration
   - Validate all user inputs
   - Follow RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) patterns
   - All sensitive operations must write to `audit.log`

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Use try-except blocks for external calls (Redis, PostgreSQL, LLM APIs)
   - Log errors with appropriate context
   - Use `tenacity` for retry logic on transient failures

5. **Testing**:
   - Aim for high test coverage (currently tracked via codecov)
   - Mock external dependencies
   - Test both success and failure scenarios
   - Use pytest fixtures for common setup

### Lua Scripts (Nginx)

- Keep scripts clean and well-commented
- Follow existing patterns in `nginx/` directory
- Test Nginx configuration changes in Docker environment

### Rust Components

- Some components (frequency-rs, tarpit-rs, markov-train-rs, jszip-rs) are written in Rust
- Follow Rust conventions and use `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy`
- See `rust-toolchain.toml` for version requirements

## Service-Specific Guidelines

### ML Model Integration

- Models should implement the adapter pattern (see `src/shared/model_provider.py`)
- Support for: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google GenAI, Cohere, Mistral
- Always handle API rate limits and errors gracefully
- Cache predictions when appropriate (use Redis)

### Payment Gateway Integration

- Multiple gateways supported: Stripe, PayPal, Braintree, Square, Adyen, Authorize.Net
- Follow existing gateway patterns in `src/pay_per_crawl/payment_gateway.py`
- Never log full payment details
- Audit all payment operations

### Plugin Development

- Plugins live in `src/plugins/`
- Must follow the plugin API contract
- Document plugin configuration and behavior
- Include tests for custom plugins

## CI/CD and Automation

### GitHub Actions Workflows

The project has extensive CI/CD automation:

1. **Testing**: `ci-tests.yml`, `tests.yml` - Run on every PR
2. **Security Audits**: Multiple comprehensive audits (security, compliance, operations)
3. **Autofix Workflows**: Automated fixes with guardrails
   - `autofix.yml` - Generic autofix launcher
   - `comprehensive-*-audit.yml` - Category-specific audits with autofix
   - `master-problem-detection.yml` - Orchestrates all categories
4. **Deployment**: `deploy-staging.yml`, `deploy-prod.yml`
5. **Code Quality**: `codacy.yml`, `pip-audit.yml`, `security-audit.yml`

### Autofix Guardrails

When autofixes run:
- Pre/post metrics are compared (flake8, bandit, eslint, etc.)
- Tests must pass
- If any metric regresses, an issue is opened and automerge is disabled
- PRs are labeled with `autofix` and the category

## Common Tasks and Patterns

### Adding a New Microservice

1. Create service directory in `src/`
2. Implement FastAPI app with main.py
3. Add dependencies to `requirements.txt`
4. Create corresponding test directory in `test/`
5. Add service to `docker-compose.yaml`
6. Update documentation

### Adding a New Detection Heuristic

1. Implement in appropriate service (usually `src/behavioral/` or `src/escalation/`)
2. Add configuration in environment variables
3. Write unit tests
4. Update relevant documentation
5. Consider adding to plugin API if generally useful

### Updating ML Models

1. Update model files in appropriate service directory
2. Increment model version
3. Update `model_version_info` Prometheus gauge
4. Test predictions against known inputs
5. Update documentation with model changes

### Adding LLM Provider Support

1. Create adapter in escalation engine following existing patterns
2. Add provider-specific configuration
3. Implement error handling and rate limiting
4. Add tests with mocked responses
5. Update documentation

## Environment Variables

Key environment variables (see `sample.env` for complete list):
- `TENANT_ID` - Multi-tenant namespace identifier
- `REDIS_HOST`, `REDIS_PORT` - Redis connection
- `POSTGRES_*` - PostgreSQL connection details
- `ADMIN_UI_ROLE` - RBAC role for admin access
- `ADMIN_UI_CORS_ORIGINS` - CORS policy (no wildcards with credentials)
- LLM API keys: `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, etc.
- Payment gateway credentials

## Documentation

When making changes:
- Update relevant documentation in `docs/`
- Update README.md for user-facing changes
- Update architecture diagrams if structure changes
- Reference `CONTRIBUTING.md` for contribution guidelines
- Keep CHANGELOG.md updated with notable changes

## Issue and PR Templates

- Use provided issue templates in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`
- Fill out PR template in `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`
- Link PRs to related issues
- Request reviews from appropriate team members

## Security Considerations

- Follow `SECURITY.md` for security vulnerability reporting
- Never expose sensitive data in logs or error messages
- Use RBAC for admin endpoints
- Implement audit logging for sensitive operations
- Set proper CORS and CSP headers
- Follow zero-trust principles

### Secret Management and HashiCorp Vault

- HashiCorp Vault or any other paid vault service **must be strictly optional** for this project.
- All secret retrieval paths **must continue to work without Vault** using existing file- and env-based mechanisms.
- Behavior requirements:
  - If `VAULT_ADDR` is **not** set:
    - Do **not** attempt to create or use a Vault client.
    - Default to legacy secret-loading behavior with no functional regression.
  - If Vault is configured but unavailable or misconfigured (DNS/TLS/auth/timeouts/bad path/etc.):
    - Log a clear warning (and, where appropriate, a metric).
    - **Do not** cause services to fail to start in default/local deployments.
    - Cleanly fall back to the legacy secret-loading mechanism.
- Implementation guidelines:
  - Wrap all Vault access in helpers (e.g., `get_vault_client`, `_fetch_vault_secret`, `_VAULT_PATH` handling) that **always** handle errors and return `None` on failure rather than raising.
  - Never make Vault a hard runtime dependency for local development or simple deployments.
  - Preserve backward compatibility for existing env/file-based configuration.
- Testing requirements:
  - Add tests that run with **no** Vault-related env vars and verify normal behavior.
  - Add tests that simulate Vault connection/auth failures and verify clean fallback to legacy behavior.
  - Avoid tests that assume Vault is reachable from the CI environment.
