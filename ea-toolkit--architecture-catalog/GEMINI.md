## What is this project?

A lightweight, Git-native architecture catalog. It replaces monolithic tools like Archi with a simple repo structure: architecture elements are registered as Markdown files, diagrams are draw.io files, and Python scripts validate, extract, refresh, and generate dashboards.

The goal is to be an open-source, lightweight alternative for architects who want Git-friendly, AI-readable architecture models without learning a DSL or paying for enterprise tooling.

## Architecture (how it works)

```
registry-mapping.yaml  ──→  registry-loader.ts  ──→  Astro pages
  (schema: types,             (reads .md files,        (static HTML
   fields, relationships)      resolves refs,           at build time)
                               builds graph)
```

**Single source of truth:** `models/registry-mapping.yaml` drives everything — the UI, validation, and data loading. Adding a new element type = add one entry to this YAML file + create a `_template.md`. Zero code changes.

**Data pipeline:** registry-mapping.yaml → `registry-loader.ts` (loadRegistry()) → `registry.ts` (bridge) → Astro pages. The loader builds an in-memory graph with elements, edges, and indexes (byType, byDomain, byLayer).

**Key design:** Framework-agnostic. ArchiMate alignment is optional, not required. Works with any architecture vocabulary. Layers are flat (1 to N), each with sub-folders for element types. No nested child layers.

## Current State

### Registry (registry-v2/)
- **4-layer structure** — flat layers, each with typed sub-folders
- **Template-driven** — each element type has a `_template.md` with typed YAML frontmatter
- **Example domains**: "Customer Management", "Billing & Payments", "Analytics & Insights" — 3 fictional B2B SaaS CRM domains with 71 elements across all 4 layers
- **Health:** 71 healthy, 71 connected, 0 orphans, 0 broken refs, 84 pages

### Catalog UI (catalog-ui/)
- **Astro 5 + React** static site for browsing the registry
- **Schema-driven** — all types, layers, and relationships derived from `models/registry-mapping.yaml`
- **ReactFlow graphs** for visualizing element relationships (via `@xyflow/react` + dagre)
- **Diagram viewer** supporting PlantUML, BPMN, and draw.io formats
- **CSS pattern:** EventCatalog-inspired RGB variable pattern: `--ec-page-bg: 255 255 255` used as `rgb(var(--ec-page-bg))`
- **3-panel layout:** icon bar (56px) + nested sidebar (315px) + main content

### Piece 1 / Piece 2 Strategy
- **Piece 1 (this repo):** registry-mapping.yaml → registry skeleton → UI. Ships first.
- **Piece 2 (future):** meta model → registry-mapping.yaml generation. Convenience tool, not critical path.

| `/crawl-data` | `/crawl-data <path> [--domain <name>] [--write]` | Scan codebase for data models, propose registry entries |

### Examples
```
/enterprise-platform-archi What data does Tenant Management own?
/enterprise-platform-archi Create a registry entry for Payment Gateway
/validate
/dashboard
/new-entry data-object "Payment Record"
/scaffold-component CapabilityHeatmap
/deploy --dry-run
/deploy --target catalog
/crawl-apis ./src --domain "Customer Management"
/crawl-data ./src --domain "Billing & Payments"
```

### Why Skills?
- **Explicit invocation** — Type `/enterprise-platform-archi` to guarantee the right context
- **Scoped search** — Each domain skill searches its own files first, minimizing token usage
- **Pattern for teams** — `/<domain>-archi` is learnable: `/payments-archi`, `/logistics-archi`, etc.

## Key Scripts

```bash
python scripts/validate.py                            # Validate model
python scripts/generate_dashboard.py                  # Generate dashboard.html
python scripts/refresh_diagrams.py                    # Sync registry to diagrams
python scripts/extract_view.py <file>                 # Extract YAML from diagram
python scripts/generate_metamodel.py <file.drawio>    # Generate registry-mapping.yaml from meta-model diagram
```

---

## Catalog UI

```bash
cd catalog-ui
npm install
npm run dev      # Start dev server on port 4321
npm run build    # Build static site
```

The UI is fully schema-driven via `models/registry-mapping.yaml`. Adding a new element type requires:
1. Add entry to `registry-mapping.yaml`
2. Create `_template.md` in the appropriate `registry-v2/` subfolder
3. Rebuild — zero code changes needed

---

## Adding New Domains

1. Create skill: `.claude/skills/<domain>-archi/SKILL.md`
2. Create sub-agent: `.claude/agents/<domain>.md`
3. Create views folder: `views/<domain>/`
4. Create registry entries in `registry-v2/` (discover folders from registry-mapping.yaml)
5. Update welcome hook to show new skill

See `templates/agents/domain-onboarding.md` for a guided template, or `docs-site/src/content/docs/contributing/how-to-contribute.md` for detailed instructions.

---

## Git Workflow

- **Never commit directly to `main`** — branch protection rules are enabled
- Always create a feature branch from `main`: `git checkout -b <type>/<short-description>`
- Branch naming: `feat/`, `fix/`, `chore/`, `docs/` prefixes
- Implement, test, commit on the branch, then push and create a PR
- Merge via GitHub PR (squash or merge commit)

## Maps Architecture

Maps are analytical views that consume registry data. They are a **separate layer** from the core registry schema.

**Two-tier design:**

1. **Core schema (`registry-mapping.yaml`)** — vocabulary-agnostic, drives the registry loader and catalog UI. No type-name conditionals, no layer-name conditionals. A user can rename every type and layer and it still works.

2. **Map definitions (separate YAML files)** — view-specific, can reference specific element types. Each map type gets its own YAML:
   - `registry-mapping.yaml` → Domain Context Map (uses registry relationships)
   - `event-mapping.yaml` → Event Flow Map (knows about events, publish/consume)
   - Future: `heatmap-mapping.yaml`, `impact-mapping.yaml`, etc.

**Why maps are NOT vocabulary-agnostic:** An event map needs to know what events are. A capability heatmap needs to know what capabilities are. These are opinionated analytical views — that's the whole point. The core registry stays generic; map views are intentionally domain-aware.

**Adding a new map type:**
1. Create a YAML definition file in `models/` (e.g., `heatmap-mapping.yaml`)
2. Create the React visualization component in `catalog-ui/src/components/graphs/`
3. Create the Astro page to render it
4. Pre-configured maps ship with the project; custom maps can be contributed

## Content & Marketing

**Do NOT create blog posts, social media drafts, or content schedules in this repo.** All content is managed in the `media-manager` repo (`/Users/raj.navakoti/Desktop/github/media-manager/`). Use media-manager's content-writer agent for drafting. The `content/` and `media/` folders here are gitignored local scratch space only.

---

## Development Principles

- Build incrementally — 1% at a time, prove each piece works
- Keep it simple — no servers, no databases, just files, Git, and Python
- Don't make architects learn new tools — draw.io, Markdown, and Git are enough
- AI integration is a side effect of the format, not a feature to build
- Domain-scoped skills — each domain gets `/<domain>-archi` to avoid searching everything
- Schema-driven — zero hardcoded types. Everything flows from registry-mapping.yaml

### Vocabulary-Agnostic Principle (CRITICAL)

This project MUST remain vocabulary-agnostic. Users can use ArchiMate, TOGAF, C4, or any custom vocabulary. The UI and loader code must NEVER contain logic that depends on specific type names, layer names, or relationship names.

**Rules for all code changes:**

1. **No type-name conditionals** — Never write `if (type === 'component')` or `type.includes('data')`. Behavior must be driven by schema properties (`graph_rank`, `layer`, `icon`) not by type key strings.
2. **No layer-name conditionals** — Never write `if (layer === 'applications_and_data')`. Layer colors and metadata come from `registry-mapping.yaml`.
3. **No relationship-name conditionals** — Never write `if (rel === 'composition')` in data/rendering logic. Relationship semantics come from `meta-model.config.ts` which reads from the YAML.
4. **Hardcoded style maps are optional enrichments** — `NODE_STYLES`, `ELEMENT_ICONS`, `ELEMENT_HIERARCHY` in TypeScript provide rich styling for known types, but unknown types MUST fall back to schema-derived values (layer color, `graph_rank`, `icon` emoji from the YAML). A user who defines a brand-new element type in `registry-mapping.yaml` should see it render correctly without touching any `.ts` or `.tsx` file.
5. **Domain anchor = `graph_rank: 0`** — The domain/area anchor element is identified by having `graph_rank: 0` in the YAML, not by checking for a specific type key like `domain`.
6. **The `archimate:` field in registry-mapping.yaml is optional metadata** — It exists for documentation/reference for ArchiMate users. The UI and loader NEVER read it.

**Test:** If a user renames every element type, layer, and relationship in `registry-mapping.yaml` to completely custom names, the catalog UI must still build and render correctly.
