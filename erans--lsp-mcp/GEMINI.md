# LSP-MCP Bridge for Claude Code

This directory contains a comprehensive LSP (Language Server Protocol) to MCP (Model Context Protocol) bridge that provides Claude Code with advanced code understanding capabilities.

Built with TypeScript for modern, type-safe development.

## LSP Specification

**Implementation based on Language Server Protocol Specification 3.17.0**
- Specification URL: https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/
- Provides semantic code understanding that surpasses basic text-based tools

## How to Use

The bridge uses a YAML configuration file to define LSP servers. You need to:

1. **Create or customize a config file** with your LSP server paths
2. **Run the bridge** with the config file and desired LSP server key

### Configuration File Setup

The bridge requires a YAML configuration file that maps server keys to commands or HTTP URLs. A sample `lsp-servers.yaml` is provided:

```yaml
# LSP Server Configuration
# Define LSP servers with their commands or HTTP endpoints
# Key: server identifier, Value: command or HTTP URL

typescript: "typescript-language-server --stdio"
python: "pylsp"
go: "gopls"
rust: "rust-analyzer"
cpp: "clangd"

# HTTP-based servers
typescript-http: "http://localhost:8080"
python-remote: "http://lsp-server.internal:3333"
```

**Important**: You may need to update the paths in the config file to match your system's LSP server installations, or create your own config file with the correct paths.

### Running the Bridge

```bash
# Using the provided config file
./dist/cli.js --config lsp-servers.yaml --lsp typescript

# Using a custom config file
./dist/cli.js --config /path/to/my-lsp-config.yaml --lsp python

# With workspace and verbose logging
./dist/cli.js --config lsp-servers.yaml --lsp go --workspace /path/to/project --verbose
```

### Examples for Different Languages

```bash
# TypeScript/JavaScript development
./dist/cli.js --config lsp-servers.yaml --lsp typescript

# Python development  
./dist/cli.js --config lsp-servers.yaml --lsp python

# Go development
./dist/cli.js --config lsp-servers.yaml --lsp go

# Rust development
./dist/cli.js --config lsp-servers.yaml --lsp rust

# C++ development
./dist/cli.js --config lsp-servers.yaml --lsp cpp

# HTTP-based LSP server
./dist/cli.js --config lsp-servers.yaml --lsp typescript-http
```

## Available Tools

The bridge provides 22 LSP-powered tools that replace and enhance basic code analysis:

### Core Navigation (Replaces Grep/Find)
- `lsp_goto_definition` - Precise definition location
- `lsp_goto_declaration` - Declaration navigation
- `lsp_goto_implementation` - Implementation finding

### Symbol Discovery (Enhanced Search)
- `lsp_document_symbols` - Structured symbol listing
- `lsp_workspace_symbols` - Intelligent symbol search
- `lsp_document_highlight` - Symbol occurrence highlighting

### Code Intelligence (Beyond Basic Tools)

# Run in development mode with custom config
npm run dev -- --config /path/to/custom-config.yaml --lsp rust
```

## Code Architecture

The codebase uses a clean, modular TypeScript architecture:

- **`src/lsp/`** - LSP client with transport layers and method implementations
- **`src/mcp/`** - MCP server with registry-based tool handling
- **`src/bridge/`** - Main orchestration component
- **`src/cli.ts`** - CLI entry point with Commander.js
- **`src/__tests__/`** - Comprehensive test suite with Vitest

## Language Server Requirements

Each language needs its corresponding LSP server installed:

- **Python**: `pip install python-lsp-server`
- **Node.js**: `npm install -g typescript-language-server`  
- **Go**: `go install golang.org/x/tools/gopls@latest`
- **Rust**: Install via rustup
- **C++**: Install clangd via package manager

## Integration Notes

- The bridge automatically initializes the LSP server for the workspace
- All tools accept file paths and position coordinates (0-based line/character)
- Results are returned as structured JSON for easy parsing
- Error handling provides clear feedback when LSP operations fail
- Built with modern async/await patterns for optimal performance

This tool significantly enhances Claude Code's ability to understand and navigate codebases with semantic precision rather than basic text matching.

## Tool Usage Preferences

**IMPORTANT**: For this LSP-MCP Bridge project, ALWAYS prefer using the MCP LSP tools over traditional text-based search and editing tools:

### Preferred MCP LSP Tools:
- Use `lsp_find_references` instead of `grep`, `rg`, or `find` for locating symbol usages
- Use `lsp_workspace_symbols` instead of `grep` or `find` for searching symbols by name
- Use `lsp_goto_definition` instead of `grep` or `find` for finding definitions
- Use `lsp_document_symbols` instead of `grep` for listing symbols in a file
- Use `lsp_rename` instead of find/replace or `sed` for renaming symbols
- Use other MCP LSP tools for semantic code navigation and understanding

### Why MCP LSP Tools?
- They provide semantic understanding of the code rather than simple text matching
- They understand language constructs, scopes, and relationships
- They offer more accurate results for code navigation and refactoring
- This project is specifically designed to showcase LSP capabilities over traditional tools

## Example Prompts for Encouraging LSP Tool Usage

When working with this LSP-MCP bridge project, use prompts like these to encourage Claude to use the semantic LSP tools:

### For Code Search and Navigation:
```
"Use the LSP tools to find all references to the `navigationTools` function. Don't use grep or find - use the MCP LSP tools for semantic understanding."

"Please use lsp_workspace_symbols to search for all classes containing 'Handler' in their name, then use lsp_goto_definition to examine their implementations."

"Instead of using grep, use lsp_find_references to locate all usages of the `registerTool` method across the codebase."
```

### For Code Analysis:
```
"Use lsp_document_symbols to list all the functions and classes in src/mcp/tools.ts, then use lsp_hover to get detailed information about each one."

"Don't use text search - use lsp_goto_implementation to find the concrete implementations of the Transport interface."

"Use the LSP tools like lsp_document_symbols and lsp_find_references to understand how the tool registry system works."
```

### For Refactoring:
```
"Use lsp_rename to safely rename the `handleRequest` function across the entire project - don't use find and replace."

"Before making changes, use lsp_find_references to see all usages of this symbol, then use lsp_code_action to see if there are any refactoring suggestions."
```

These prompts help Claude understand that semantic LSP tools should be preferred over traditional text-based tools for better accuracy and understanding.

# important-instruction-reminders
Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.
NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal.
ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one.
NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.
