Pieces MCP provides access to Long-Term Memory (LTM-2.7) engine, allowing agents to query workflow context, code snippets, notes, and activity history. This significantly improves agent effectiveness by providing access to your workflow history and saved context.

**Key Benefits:**
- **Context Continuity**: Agents understand recent work and decisions across sessions
- **Pattern Reuse**: Discover existing implementations and proven solutions
- **Decision Tracking**: Understand project evolution and documented challenges
- **Resource Discovery**: Access saved code snippets, bookmarks, and notes
- **Workflow Efficiency**: Faster problem-solving with historical context

### Prerequisites (Optional)
- **PiecesOS**: Optional - Can be installed and running (check system tray/processes) if you want to use Pieces MCP
- **Long-Term Memory Engine (LTM-2.7)**: Optional - Can be enabled in PiecesOS if you want LTM features
- **MCP Configuration**: Optional - Pieces MCP server can be configured in Cursor Settings if desired

### Agent Workflow Integration

#### Automatic Usage in All Modes
**Note**: Pieces MCP works in **ALL modes** (Auto, Agent, Manual). The `ask_pieces_ltm` tool is automatically available when MCP server is configured, but using it is **optional**.

**Best Practice**: Pieces MCP can be helpful for context retrieval, but agents should use standard workflow if Pieces MCP is not available or not desired.

#### On Agent Creation - Optional Enhancement
**Note**: When a new agent session starts, you **can optionally** use Pieces MCP for additional context:

1. **Optional: Check Pieces MCP Availability**:
   - **Can attempt to use `ask_pieces_ltm` tool** if you want additional context from workflow history
   - If tool is available and you think it would be helpful, you can use it
   - If tool is not available or you prefer not to use it, continue with standard workflow
   - **Pieces MCP is optional** - standard workflow works fine without it

2. **Optional: Query Recent Frontend Context** (if tool available and desired):
   - **Can query**: "What was I working on in the frontend in the last 24 hours?" (if helpful)
   - **Can query**: "What recent changes were made to Angular components?" (if helpful)
   - **Can query**: "Show me recent work on the payment flow" (if helpful)
   - **Can query**: "What frontend issues or bugs were recently fixed?" (if helpful)
   - **Can query**: "What UI/UX improvements were recently implemented?" (if helpful)
   - Use these queries only if you think they would provide useful context

3. **Optional: Understand Current Frontend State** (if helpful):
   - "What is the current deployment status of the frontend?" (if Pieces MCP might have this info)
   - "What frontend features are in progress?" (if Pieces MCP might have this info)
   - "What technical debt or known issues exist in the frontend?" (if Pieces MCP might have this info)
   - "What recent accessibility or performance improvements were made?" (if Pieces MCP might have this info)

### Troubleshooting

**MCP Server Not Running**:
- Verify PiecesOS is running (check system tray/processes)
- Check MCP server status in Cursor settings (should show "running")
- Restart MCP server if needed
- Verify LTM engine is enabled in PiecesOS

**Tool Not Available**:
- **Verify MCP Connection**: Check green dot in MCP settings (should show "running")
- **Check Mode**: Tool works in ALL modes (Auto, Agent, Manual) - no special mode required
- **Restart Cursor**: Sometimes requires IDE restart after MCP configuration
- **Verify PiecesOS**: Ensure PiecesOS is running and LTM is enabled
- **Note**: In Auto Mode, tool should be automatically available - if not, check MCP server status

**No Results from Queries**:
- Verify LTM is enabled
- Check PiecesOS is capturing your workflow
- Wait for indexing (LTM may need time to index recent activity)
- Check date ranges in queries reference timeframes with activity

**Documentation**: See `MetaData/Documentation/Development/PIECES_MCP_INTEGRATION.md` for complete troubleshooting guide.

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Build Command Safety Rules
**NEVER** run build commands that pipe directly to the agent output. Large build outputs can crash the agent and disconnect the chat session.

**❌ FORBIDDEN Commands:**
- `npm run build 2>&1 | Select-Object -First 100` (crashes agent)
- `npm run build | head -n 100` (crashes agent)
- Any command that streams build output directly to stdout without file buffering

**✅ REQUIRED: Use File-Based Output Capture**
When running build commands, ALWAYS capture output to a file first, then read portions of the file:

```powershell
# CORRECT: Capture to file, then read
cd FE
npm run build 2>&1 | Out-File -FilePath build-output.log -Encoding utf8
# Then read only what's needed
Get-Content build-output.log -Tail 50
# Or filter for errors only
Select-String -Path build-output.log -Pattern "ERROR|Error|error|Failed|failed" | Select-Object -First 20
```

**Alternative Safe Patterns:**
```powershell
# Check exit code first, then read file
$output = npm run build 2>&1 | Out-File -FilePath build-output.log -Encoding utf8
if ($LASTEXITCODE -eq 0) {
    Write-Host "Build succeeded"
    Get-Content build-output.log -Tail 20
} else {
    Select-String -Path build-output.log -Pattern "ERROR|Error|error|Failed|failed" | Select-Object -First 30
}
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Angular build outputs can be extremely verbose (1000+ lines)
- Streaming large output directly crashes the agent
- File-based capture isolates the agent from output streams
- Reading file portions allows selective, safe output display

**Exception**: Only use direct piping for commands with guaranteed small output (< 20 lines), and even then prefer file capture for consistency.

### Deployment Flow
1. **Production**: Push to main branch → Auto-deploy to S3/CloudFront
2. **Local Development**: Run `ng serve` for local testing

### SignalR Hub Details
- **LotteryHub** (`/ws/lottery`):
  - **Service**: `amesa-lottery-service`
  - **Events Broadcasted**:
    - `OnLotteryUpdate` - House status, ticket sales, participation updates
    - `OnFavoriteUpdate` - Watchlist changes (added/removed)
    - `OnEntryStatusChange` - Ticket entry status changes
    - `OnDrawReminder` - Lottery draw countdown reminders
    - `OnRecommendation` - House recommendations
    - `InventoryUpdated` - Real-time ticket inventory updates
    - `TicketPurchased` - Ticket purchase notifications
    - `CountdownUpdated` - Lottery countdown updates
    - `LotteryDrawStarted` - Draw start notifications
    - `LotteryDrawCompleted` - Draw completion notifications
  - **User Groups**: Automatically managed in `OnConnectedAsync()` (no manual join/leave needed)
  - **Authorization**: JWT Bearer token required
  
- **NotificationHub** (`/ws/notifications`):
  - **Service**: `amesa-notification-service`
  - **Events Broadcasted**:
    - `OnNotification` - User notifications (email, SMS, WebPush, Telegram)
    - `OnUserStatusUpdate` - User online/offline status
  - **User Groups**: Automatically managed in `OnConnectedAsync()` (no manual join/leave needed)
  - **Authorization**: JWT Bearer token required

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

### HTTP Request/Response Patterns
- **No HTTP Interceptors**: All HTTP logic centralized in `ApiService`
- **Token Management**: Automatic token refresh via `ApiService.token$` observable
- **Request Retry**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff for network errors
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling via `ErrorHandlingService`
- **Offline Support**: `OfflineService` queues requests when offline, retries when back online
- **Request Format**: All requests use `ApiResponse<T>` wrapper format
- **Base URL**: Environment-specific (`/api/v1` for local, CloudFront URL for production)

### SignalR Real-Time Communication
- **Hubs**: 
  - `/ws/lottery` - Lottery updates (LotteryHub)
  - `/ws/notifications` - Notifications (NotificationHub)
- **Transport**: LongPolling (required for CloudFront compatibility, WebSocket not supported)
- **Connection Pattern**:
  - Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff (max 5 retries)
  - Connection state tracked with signals (`isConnected`, `connectionState`)
  - Token-based authentication (JWT sent in connection headers)
- **Event Subscriptions**:
  - `LotteryUpdateEvent` - House status, ticket sales, participation updates
  - `NotificationEvent` - User notifications (email, SMS, WebPush, Telegram)
  - `UserStatusEvent` - User online/offline status
  - `FavoriteUpdateEvent` - Watchlist changes (added/removed)
  - `EntryStatusChangeEvent` - Ticket entry status changes
  - `DrawReminderEvent` - Lottery draw countdown reminders
  - `RecommendationEvent` - House recommendations
  - `InventoryUpdateEvent` - Real-time ticket inventory updates
  - `CountdownUpdateEvent` - Lottery countdown updates
  - `ReservationStatusUpdateEvent` - Ticket reservation status
- **Reconnection Strategy**:
  - Exponential backoff: 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s
  - Max retries: 5
  - Automatic reconnection on connection loss
  - User group management handled automatically by backend in `OnConnectedAsync()`
- **Service**: `RealtimeService` manages all SignalR connections and event subscriptions

### Error Handling Patterns
- **Error Handling Service**: `ErrorHandlingService` centralizes all error handling
- **Error Severity Levels**: `low`, `medium`, `high`, `critical`
- **Error Response Format**:
  ```typescript
  {
    success: false,
    error: {
      code: "ERROR_CODE",
      message: "Human-readable message",
      details?: any
    }
  }
  ```
- **Error Code Mapping**: Frontend maps backend error codes to user-friendly messages
- **Toast Notifications**: Critical/high/medium errors show toast notifications
- **Error Logging**: All errors logged with context (userId, request details)
- **401 Handling**: Automatic token refresh attempt on 401 errors
- **Network Errors**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff

### Caching Strategies
- **In-Memory Cache**: Service-level caching (5 min TTL for houses list)
- **localStorage Cache**: Persistent cache for houses, favorites, active entries, user stats
  - Houses list: 30 min TTL
  - Individual houses: 1 hour TTL
  - User favorites: 15 min TTL
  - Active entries: 15 min TTL
  - User stats: 15 min TTL
- **sessionStorage Cache**: Temporary cache for dashboard data (5 min TTL)
- **Cache Invalidation**:
  - Time-based: TTL expiration
  - Event-based: SignalR events invalidate relevant caches
  - User action-based: Add/remove favorite, purchase ticket
  - Authentication-based: Login/logout clears user-specific caches
- **Cache Keys**:
  - Houses list: `houses_list`
  - Individual house: `house:{houseId}`
  - User favorites: `user_favorites:{userId}`
  - Active entries: `user_active_entries:{userId}`
  - User stats: `user_stats:{userId}`
- **Real-Time Data Protection**: Methods like `getAvailableTickets()` are never cached (always fetch fresh)

### Offline Handling
- **Offline Detection**: `OfflineService` monitors network status
- **Request Queuing**: Failed requests queued when offline
- **Queue Persistence**: Queued requests stored in memory (cleared on page refresh)
- **Automatic Retry**: Queued requests automatically retried when network restored
- **Queue Size**: No explicit limit (monitor memory usage)
- **Integration**: `ApiService` uses `OfflineService` for queuing failed requests

### Performance Monitoring
- **Performance Service**: `PerformanceService` tracks application performance metrics
- **Route Performance**: `RoutePerformanceService` tracks route load times
- **Memory Monitoring**: `MemoryMonitorService` tracks memory usage
- **Metrics Collected**:
  - Route load times
  - API call durations
  - Memory usage
  - Component render times

### State Management Patterns
- **Angular Signals** (Primary State Management):
  - **Signal Creation**: `signal<T>(initialValue)` for reactive state
  - **Computed Signals**: `computed(() => derivedValue)` for derived state
  - **Effects**: `effect(() => { sideEffects })` for side effects based on signal changes
  - **Usage Examples**:
    - `showPassword = signal(false)` - UI state (e.g., password visibility)
    - `isVerified = signal(false)` - Verification status
    - `isLoading = signal(true)` - Loading states
    - `effect(() => { /* react to signal changes */ })` - Side effects (e.g., favorites updates)
  - **Location**: Used throughout components and services (e.g., `registration-page.component.ts`, `verification-gate.component.ts`, `lottery-favorites.component.ts`)
- **RxJS Observables** (Async Operations & Streams):
  - **Observable**: For async operations (HTTP calls, timers, event streams)
  - **Subject**: For multicasting values to multiple subscribers
  - **BehaviorSubject**: For state that needs initial value and current value tracking
  - **Operators**: `map`, `filter`, `switchMap`, `catchError`, `retry`, `takeUntil`, etc.
  - **Usage Examples**:
    - HTTP calls return `Observable<T>` (e.g., `getHouseById(id): Observable<HouseDto>`)
    - `Subject<void>` for cleanup/unsubscribe patterns (e.g., `cleanup$ = new Subject<void>()`)
    - `firstValueFrom()` for converting Observable to Promise (e.g., in SignalR service)
  - **Location**: Used in services (e.g., `lottery.service.ts`, `realtime.service.ts`, `api.service.ts`)
- **State Storage**:
  - **localStorage**: Persistent state (user preferences, theme, language)
  - **sessionStorage**: Session-scoped state (temporary data)
  - **In-Memory**: Component/service-level state (signals, observables)
- **State Synchronization**:
  - **Real-time Updates**: SignalR events update local state (e.g., lottery updates, notifications)
  - **Cache Invalidation**: State updates trigger cache invalidation
  - **Cross-Component Communication**: Services with signals/observables shared across components

### Routing Patterns
- **Lazy Loading**:
  - **Method**: `loadComponent()` for route-based code splitting
  - **Benefits**: Reduces initial bundle size, improves load time
  - **Configuration**: Routes configured with `loadComponent` in route definitions
- **Route Guards**:
  - **AuthGuard**: `canActivate()` checks authentication and email verification
    - Checks: `user.isAuthenticated` and `userDto.emailVerified`
    - Redirects: `/` if not authenticated, `/verify-email` if email not verified
    - Toast Notifications: Shows warning/error messages
    - Location: `src/guards/auth.guard.ts`
- **Custom Preloading Strategy**:
  - **Class**: `CustomPreloadingStrategy` implements `PreloadingStrategy`
  - **Priority-Based Delays**:
    - **High Priority** (0ms delay): `about`, `faq`, `help`
    - **Medium Priority** (2s delay): `sponsorship`, `partners`, `how-it-works`
    - **Low Priority** (5s delay): `register`, `member-settings`, `promotions`, `responsible-gambling`
    - **Default** (3s delay): Unknown routes
  - **Purpose**: Preload routes after initial load without blocking critical resources
  - **Location**: `src/app.preloading-strategy.ts`
  - **Registration**: Configured in `main.ts` via `withPreloading(CustomPreloadingStrategy)`
- **Route Configuration**:
  - **Wildcard Routes**: `**` for catch-all (e.g., 404 page)
  - **Route Parameters**: `:id` for dynamic segments (e.g., `/house/:id`)
  - **Query Parameters**: Accessible via `ActivatedRoute.queryParams`
  - **Route Data**: Static data passed via `data` property in route config

## Testing Infrastructure
- **E2E Testing**: Playwright configured with 5 browser projects
  - Chromium (Desktop Chrome)
  - Firefox (Desktop Firefox)
  - WebKit (Desktop Safari)
  - Mobile Chrome (Pixel 5)
  - Mobile Safari (iPhone 12)
- **Unit Testing**: Karma/Jasmine with ChromeHeadless
- **Test Configuration**: 
  - CI test script: `ng test demo --browsers=ChromeHeadless --watch=false --code-coverage=false`
  - Playwright base URL: `http://localhost:4200` (configurable via `BASE_URL` env var)
  - Retry strategy: 2 retries on CI, 0 locally
  - Trace collection: On first retry
  - Screenshots: Only on failure
  - Video: Retain on failure

### Testing Patterns
- **Unit Testing** (Jasmine/Karma):
  - **Framework**: Jasmine for test syntax, Karma for test runner
  - **Test Location**: `*.spec.ts` files alongside source files
  - **Mocking**: 
    - Angular testing utilities (`TestBed`, `ComponentFixture`)
    - Service mocks using `jasmine.createSpy()` or `jasmine.createSpyObj()`
    - HTTP client mocking via `HttpClientTestingModule`
  - **Test Structure**: `describe()` blocks for test suites, `it()` for test cases
  - **Angular Testing Utilities**:
    - `TestBed.configureTestingModule()` for test module setup
    - `ComponentFixture` for component testing
    - `DebugElement` for DOM querying
  - **Coverage**: Target 80%+ code coverage for services and components
- **E2E Testing** (Playwright):
  - **Framework**: Playwright with TypeScript
  - **Page Object Model**: Reusable page objects for test maintainability
  - **Test Data**: 
    - Test fixtures for consistent test data
    - Isolated test data per test to avoid dependencies
  - **Browser Projects**: 5 projects (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit, Mobile Chrome, Mobile Safari)
  - **Test Configuration**:
    - Base URL: `http://localhost:4200` (configurable via `BASE_URL` env var)
    - Retry strategy: 2 retries on CI, 0 locally
    - Trace collection: On first retry
    - Screenshots: Only on failure
    - Video: Retain on failure
  - **Test Organization**: Tests organized by feature/page in `e2e/` directory
  - **Best Practices**:
    - Use data-testid attributes for reliable element selection
    - Wait for network requests to complete
    - Clean up test data after tests

### Application Initialization Patterns
- **Bootstrap Method**: `bootstrapApplication()` from `@angular/platform-browser`
- **Entry Point**: `src/main.ts`
- **Provider Configuration**:
  - **Services**: All core services registered as providers (TranslationService, ThemeService, AuthService, etc.)
  - **Error Handler**: Custom `ErrorHandlingService` via `{ provide: ErrorHandler, useClass: ErrorHandlingService }`
  - **HTTP Client**: `provideHttpClient()` for HTTP requests
  - **Router**: `provideRouter()` with routes, preloading strategy, and in-memory scrolling
  - **Animations**: `provideAnimations()` for Angular animations
- **APP_INITIALIZER Pattern** (Non-blocking startup):
  - **Purpose**: Initialize services before app starts without blocking bootstrap
  - **Translation Initialization** (`initializeTranslations`):
    - Priority: localStorage → browser language → default ('en')
    - Non-blocking: Loads translations in background, app starts immediately
    - Location: `src/main.ts`
  - **Service Initialization** (`initializeServices`):
    - Sets up cross-service dependencies (e.g., `userPreferencesService.setThemeService()`)
    - Loads theme and preferences from localStorage (synchronous, no network)
    - Applies accessibility settings from preferences
    - Non-blocking: All operations synchronous, resolves immediately
  - **Multi-provider**: `multi: true` allows multiple `APP_INITIALIZER` functions
- **Router Configuration**:
  - **Preloading**: `CustomPreloadingStrategy` with priority-based delays
  - **Scrolling**: `withInMemoryScrolling({ scrollPositionRestoration: 'top', anchorScrolling: 'enabled' })`
  - **Routes**: Lazy-loaded routes with `loadComponent()`
- **Console Override**: `./console-override` removes console logs in production
- **Best Practices**:
  - Keep initialization non-blocking (no network requests in APP_INITIALIZER)
  - Use localStorage for fast initial state
  - Network requests happen via service subscriptions after bootstrap
  - Resolve APP_INITIALIZER promises immediately for synchronous operations

### Build & Packaging Patterns

| Aspect | Configuration |
|--------|---------------|
| **Build Config** | `angular.json` (project: `demo`) |
| **Builder** | `@angular/build:application` |
| **Output Path** | `dist/demo/browser/` |
| **Development Build** | Source maps ✅, Named chunks ✅, No optimization, No license extraction |
| **Production Build** | AOT ✅, Full optimization ✅, Output hashing: "all", Source maps ❌, License extraction ✅, `environment.ts` → `environment.prod.ts` |
| **Assets** | `src/assets/` (static), `sw.js` (service worker to root) |
| **Styles** | `src/styles.css`, `src/global_styles.css` |
| **Polyfills** | `zone.js` (Angular change detection) |
| **TypeScript** | `tsconfig.app.json` (strict mode, ES2022) |
| **Bundle Strategy** | Code splitting (lazy loading), Vendor chunks, Common chunks |
| **Deployment** | S3 bucket → CloudFront distribution (cache invalidation required) |

## Common Commands
