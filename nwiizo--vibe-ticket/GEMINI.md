vibe-ticket new fix-bug --title "Fix login issue" --priority high

# List all tickets
vibe-ticket list

# Start working on a ticket (creates worktree by default)
vibe-ticket start fix-bug
# This creates: ./vibe-ticket-vibeticket-fix-bug/

# Start without worktree (branch only)
vibe-ticket start fix-bug --no-worktree

# Show current status
vibe-ticket check
```

### Working with Tickets
```bash
# Show ticket details
vibe-ticket show <ticket>

# Update ticket
vibe-ticket edit <ticket> --status review

# Add tasks to ticket
vibe-ticket task add "Write unit tests"
vibe-ticket task add "Update documentation"

# Complete tasks
vibe-ticket task complete 1

# Close ticket
vibe-ticket close <ticket> --message "Fixed the login issue"
```

### Review Workflow (NEW!)
```bash
# Mark ticket for review
vibe-ticket review <ticket> --notes "Ready for review"

# Approve ticket and mark as done
vibe-ticket approve <ticket> --message "Looks good!"

# Request changes on a ticket
vibe-ticket request-changes <ticket> --changes "Please add tests"

# Hand off ticket to another agent/person
vibe-ticket handoff <ticket> <assignee> --notes "Handing off to specialist"
```

### Kanban Board View (NEW!)
```bash
# Show tickets in kanban board format
vibe-ticket board

# Filter by assignee
vibe-ticket board --assignee "claude-code"

# Show only active tickets
vibe-ticket board --active-only

# Compact view
vibe-ticket board --compact
```

### Search and Filter
```bash
# Search tickets
vibe-ticket search "login"

# Filter by status
vibe-ticket list --status doing

# Filter by priority
vibe-ticket list --priority high
```

### Bulk Operations
```bash
# Update multiple tickets at once
vibe-ticket bulk update --status doing --priority high tag1,tag2

# Tag multiple tickets
vibe-ticket bulk tag "important,urgent" ticket1 ticket2 ticket3

# Close multiple tickets
vibe-ticket bulk close ticket1 ticket2 --message "Batch close"

# Archive old tickets
vibe-ticket bulk archive --before 2024-01-01
```

### Saved Filters
```bash

```

### Custom Hooks
```bash
# Create a hook for ticket lifecycle events
vibe-ticket hook create notify-slack post-close \
  --command 'curl -X POST $SLACK_WEBHOOK -d "{\"text\": \"Ticket $TICKET_SLUG closed\"}"' \
  --description "Notify Slack on ticket close"

# List all hooks
vibe-ticket hook list

# Enable/disable a hook
vibe-ticket hook enable notify-slack
vibe-ticket hook disable notify-slack

- `/plan --tech-stack rust,actix --architecture microservices` - Generate implementation plan
- `/tasks --granularity fine --parallel` - Create executable task list
- `/validate --check-ambiguities` - Validate specification

Example workflow:
```
/specify "Build a REST API for user management"
/plan --tech-stack rust,postgresql
/tasks --parallel --export-tickets
/validate --generate-report
```

For detailed slash command documentation, see [SLASH_COMMANDS.md](SLASH_COMMANDS.md).

### Using MCP Tools in Your Sessions

When I have access to vibe-ticket MCP tools, I can:
- Create and manage tickets directly
- Update ticket status and properties
- Generate specifications from natural language requirements
- Create implementation plans and task lists automatically
- Add and complete tasks
- Search and filter tickets
- Manage Git worktrees

Example: "Create a ticket for implementing user authentication with high priority"
→ I'll use `vibe-ticket_new` with appropriate arguments

### Key Points for MCP Usage

- **Ticket References**: Use either slug or ID
- **Status Values**: `todo`, `doing`, `done`, `blocked`, `review`
- **Priority Values**: `low`, `medium`, `high`, `critical`
- **Synchronization**: CLI and MCP share the same data instantly

## Project Configuration

The project has been initialized with default settings. You can customize them using the config commands above.

### Git Worktree Configuration
```yaml
git:
  worktree_enabled: true              # Enable worktree support
  worktree_default: true              # Create worktree by default when starting tickets
  worktree_prefix: "./{project}-vibeticket-"  # Directory naming pattern
  worktree_cleanup_on_close: false   # Auto-remove worktree when closing ticket
```

## Spec-Driven Development Workflow

### Overview
vibe-ticket now supports spec-driven development, inspired by GitHub's spec-kit. This approach transforms natural language requirements into executable specifications that generate implementations.

### Workflow Steps

1. **Specify** - Create specification from natural language
   ```bash
   vibe-ticket spec specify "Build a REST API for user management"
   # Or in Claude Code: /specify "Build a REST API for user management"
   ```

2. **Plan** - Generate implementation plan
   ```bash
   vibe-ticket spec plan --tech-stack rust,actix-web --architecture microservices
   # Or in Claude Code: /plan --tech-stack rust,actix-web
   ```

3. **Tasks** - Create executable task list
   ```bash
   vibe-ticket spec tasks --granularity fine --parallel --export-tickets
   # Or in Claude Code: /tasks --parallel --export-tickets
   ```

4. **Validate** - Check specification completeness
   ```bash
   vibe-ticket spec validate --check-ambiguities --generate-report
   # Or in Claude Code: /validate --generate-report
   ```

### Key Concepts

- **[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]** markers: Identify ambiguous requirements
- **[P]** markers: Tasks that can execute in parallel
- **Three-phase approach**: Requirements → Design → Tasks
- **Granularity levels**: fine (20+ tasks), medium (10 tasks), coarse (5 tasks)

## Workflow Guidelines

1. **For new features**: Start with spec-driven development
   - Use `/specify` to create specification from requirements
   - Generate plan and tasks automatically
   - Export tasks as tickets for tracking

2. **For bug fixes**: Use traditional ticket workflow
   - Create ticket directly with `vibe-ticket new`
   - Start work with automatic worktree creation

3. When starting a ticket, a Git worktree is created automatically
   - Work in the worktree directory: `./vibe-ticket-vibeticket-<slug>/`
   - Each ticket has its own isolated working directory

4. Break down complex work into tasks within tickets
5. Keep ticket status updated as work progresses
6. Close tickets with meaningful completion messages
7. Remove worktrees when done: `vibe-ticket worktree remove <ticket>`

## Best Practices for This Project

- Follow the established ticket naming conventions
- Use appropriate priority levels (low, medium, high, critical)
- Tag tickets for better organization
- Document decisions in ticket descriptions
- Link related tickets when applicable

## Tips for Claude Code

When helping with this project:
1. Always check for active tickets before suggesting new work
2. Reference ticket IDs in commit messages
3. Update ticket status as implementation progresses
4. Use `vibe-ticket check` to understand current context
5. Generate new tickets for bugs or features discovered during development
6. **USE MCP TOOLS**: When users describe repetitive tasks or workflow improvements, proactively suggest using vibe-ticket MCP tools to automate them
7. **USE SLASH COMMANDS**: Leverage spec-driven development commands:
   - `/specify` when user describes new features
   - `/plan` to generate implementation strategies
   - `/tasks` to break down work into manageable pieces
   - `/validate` to ensure specifications are complete
8. **IMPORTANT**: After completing each major task or work session, provide a retrospective that includes:
   - What was accomplished
   - What challenges were encountered
   - What could be improved for next time
   - Any vibe-tickets that should be created for follow-up work
   - Lessons learned that could benefit future development

### Proactive Suggestions

When you see opportunities, suggest:
- "Would you like me to create a specification for this feature using `/specify`?"
- "I can generate an implementation plan with `/plan --tech-stack <tech>`"
- "Should I create parallel tasks for this work using `/tasks --parallel`?"
- "Let me validate the specification to check for ambiguities"

## MCP Integration for AI Assistants

vibe-ticket provides full MCP support, allowing AI assistants to:
- Create and manage tickets programmatically
- Automate repetitive ticket operations
- Generate reports and analytics
- Integrate ticket management with code changes

**When to suggest MCP tools:**
- User mentions creating multiple similar tickets
- Repetitive task management is needed
- Bulk operations on tickets would save time
- Workflow automation opportunities arise

Example: "I notice you're creating several similar tickets. Would you like me to use the vibe-ticket MCP tools to automate this process?"

## Complete Workflow Example

Here's how to use vibe-ticket for a new feature development:

```bash
# Step 1: Create specification from requirements
vibe-ticket spec specify "Build a user authentication system with JWT tokens"

# Step 2: Generate implementation plan
vibe-ticket spec plan --tech-stack rust,jwt,redis --architecture layered

# Step 3: Create tasks with parallel execution
vibe-ticket spec tasks --granularity fine --parallel --export-tickets

# Step 4: Validate specification
vibe-ticket spec validate --check-ambiguities --generate-report

# Step 5: Start working on generated tickets
vibe-ticket list --status todo
vibe-ticket start auth-t001-initialize

# Step 6: Track progress
vibe-ticket task add "Set up JWT library"
vibe-ticket task complete 1

# Step 7: Complete and close
vibe-ticket close auth-t001-initialize --message "Initialized authentication module"
```

### Using Slash Commands in Claude Code

```
User: "I need to build a REST API for managing blog posts"

Claude: I'll help you create a specification for that using spec-driven development.

/specify "Build a REST API for managing blog posts with CRUD operations"

[Specification created successfully]

Now let me generate an implementation plan:

/plan --tech-stack rust,actix-web,postgresql --architecture rest

[Plan generated]

Let's create tasks that can be executed in parallel:

/tasks --granularity medium --parallel --export-tickets

[12 tasks created and exported as tickets]

Finally, let me validate the specification:

/validate --check-ambiguities

[Validation complete - no issues found]

You now have a complete specification with an implementation plan and 12 tickets ready to work on. 
You can start with: vibe-ticket start api-t001-initialize
```

## Lessons Learned from Development

### Active Ticket Management
- Always update `.vibe-ticket/active_ticket` file when switching between tickets
- Use `vibe-ticket start <id> --no-worktree` when a worktree already exists
- Check ticket ID format carefully - use full UUID when needed

### Worktree Best Practices
- Each ticket has its own worktree directory for isolated development
- Worktree names follow pattern: `vibe-ticket-vibeticket<date>-<slug>`
- Always verify worktree existence before creating new ones
- Clean up worktrees after closing tickets to save disk space

### Documentation Testing
- Run `cargo test --doc` to verify all documentation examples
- Doc tests ensure code examples in documentation remain accurate
- Keeping doc tests passing prevents documentation drift

## Work Retrospectives

### Why Retrospectives Matter
Retrospectives help improve the development process by:
- Identifying recurring issues before they become major problems
- Documenting solutions for future reference
- Creating actionable tickets for improvements
- Building institutional knowledge

### When to Conduct Retrospectives
- After completing any release preparation
- When finishing a complex feature implementation
- After resolving critical bugs
- At the end of each work session involving multiple tasks
- When encountering unexpected challenges
