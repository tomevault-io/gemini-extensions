# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**cdkd** (CDK Direct) is an experimental project that deploys AWS CDK applications directly via AWS SDK/Cloud Control API without going through CloudFormation. It aims to eliminate CloudFormation overhead and achieve faster deployments.

**Important Notes**:

- NOT recommended for production use (development/testing environments only)
- Educational and experimental project
- NOT intended as a replacement for the official AWS CDK CLI

## Architecture Overview

cdkd has a 7-layer system architecture:

```

### Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Hybrid Provisioning Strategy**
   - Preferred: SDK Providers for common resource types - direct synchronous API calls, no polling overhead
   - Fallback: Cloud Control API for additional resource types (requires async polling)
   - Implemented with Provider Registry pattern

2. **S3-based State Management**
   - No DynamoDB required
   - Optimistic locking via S3 Conditional Writes (`If-None-Match`, `If-Match`)
   - **Region-prefixed key layout (`version: 2`, since PR 1)**:
     - State: `s3://bucket/cdkd/{stackName}/{region}/state.json`
     - Lock:  `s3://bucket/cdkd/{stackName}/{region}/lock.json`
   - The same `stackName` in two regions has two independent state files —
     changing `env.region` no longer silently overwrites the prior region.
   - Legacy `version: 1` layout (`cdkd/{stackName}/state.json`) is still
     readable; the next write auto-migrates and deletes the legacy key.
   - An old cdkd binary fails clearly on a `version: 2` blob instead of
     silently mishandling unknown fields.
   - State bucket region is resolved dynamically via `GetBucketLocation` (`src/utils/aws-region-resolver.ts`); the state-bucket S3 client is rebuilt for the bucket's actual region before any state operation, so the CLI works regardless of the profile region. Provisioning clients (CC API, Lambda, IAM, etc.) keep using `env.region` — only the state-bucket S3 client is region-corrected.

3. **Event-driven DAG Execution**
   - Analyzes dependencies via `Ref` / `Fn::GetAtt` / `DependsOn`
   - Dispatches each resource as soon as ALL of its own dependencies complete (no level barrier — downstream work does not wait for unrelated siblings in the same DAG level)
   - Bounded by `--concurrency` across the whole stack
   - Implemented in `src/deployment/dag-executor.ts`

4. **Intrinsic Function Resolution**
   - All CloudFormation intrinsic functions supported: `Ref`, `Fn::GetAtt`, `Fn::Join`, `Fn::Sub`, `Fn::Select`, `Fn::Split`, `Fn::If`, `Fn::Equals`, `Fn::And`, `Fn::Or`, `Fn::Not`, `Fn::ImportValue`, `Fn::FindInMap`, `Fn::Base64`, `Fn::GetAZs`, `Fn::Cidr`

## Key Files and Directories

### Core Directories

- **src/cli/** - CLI command implementations (deploy, destroy, diff, synth, list/ls, bootstrap, force-unlock, import, state), config resolution.

  **Top-level vs `state` subcommand split**: top-level commands (`deploy`, `destroy`, `diff`, `synth`, `list`, `import`, `orphan`) require a CDK app — they synthesize a template to know what they're operating on. The `cdkd state ...` subcommand family (`state info`, `state list`, `state resources`, `state show`, `state orphan`, `state destroy`, `state migrate`) operates on the S3 state bucket only and does NOT need the CDK code; it's the right place to inspect / clean up state when the CDK app is missing or you don't want to synth. The two `orphan` commands operate at **different granularities** (this is the breaking change in PR #92): `cdkd orphan <constructPath>...` is **per-resource** (mirrors upstream `cdk orphan --unstable=orphan`) and rewrites every sibling reference (Ref / Fn::GetAtt / Fn::Sub / dependencies) so the next deploy doesn't re-create the orphan; `cdkd state orphan <stack>...` is **whole-stack** and removes the entire state record without touching siblings. Both orphan variants delete ONLY cdkd state; AWS resources are left intact (use `destroy` / `state destroy` to delete them).

  `cdkd import <stack> --app "..."` adopts AWS-deployed resources into cdkd state. Three modes: (1) **auto** (no flags) — every resource in the template is looked up by its `aws:cdk:path` tag (cdkd's value-add over CDK CLI for whole-stack adoption); (2) **selective** (CDK CLI parity, default whenever `--resource <logicalId>=<physicalId>`, `--resource-mapping <file.json>`, or `--resource-mapping-inline '<json>'` is supplied) — ONLY the listed resources are imported, every other template resource is reported as `out of scope` and left out of state for the next deploy to CREATE. Matches `cdk import --resource-mapping` / `--resource-mapping-inline` semantics, including refusing to silently no-op on a typo'd logical ID; `--resource-mapping` and `--resource-mapping-inline` are mutually exclusive (matches upstream); (3) **hybrid** (`--auto` with overrides) — listed resources use the explicit physical id; the rest still go through tag-based auto-import (the pre-PR default, now opt-in). `--record-resource-mapping <file>` writes cdkd's resolved `{logicalId: physicalId}` map (covers explicit overrides AND auto / hybrid mode tag-lookups) to disk before the confirmation prompt — emitted even when the user says "no" or under `--dry-run`, so the resolved data can be replayed as `--resource-mapping` in non-interactive CI re-runs (mirrors `cdk import --record-resource-mapping`). Refuses to overwrite an existing state file without `--force`.

  **`provider.import` support coverage** (each entry is independent — keep additions one-per-line so parallel PRs don't conflict on rebase):

  *Unsupported*: providers that do not implement `import` are reported as `unsupported` and skipped.

  **`cdkd import` vs upstream `cdk import` — parity notes** (the README has the full matrix; this is a quick checklist when working on the import code path):

  - **Mechanism is per-resource SDK calls, not a CloudFormation changeset.** `cdkd import` is therefore **not atomic**. `import.ts` collects per-resource outcomes (`imported` / `skipped-not-found` / `skipped-no-impl` / `skipped-out-of-scope` / `failed`) and only writes state after a final confirmation (`--yes` to skip). A partial import can be backed out with `cdkd state orphan <stack>`.
  - **No interactive prompt for missing IDs.** Upstream's TTY default prompts per resource; cdkd looks IDs up by `aws:cdk:path` tag (in `auto` / `hybrid` modes) or treats them as `out of scope` (in selective mode). The only prompt is the final "write state?" gate.
  - **`--resource-mapping <file>`: parity.** Same JSON shape (`{"LogicalId": "physical-id"}`) and same semantics — only listed resources imported, unlisted resources rejected, typo'd logical IDs abort before any AWS call.
  - **`--resource-mapping-inline '<json>'`: parity.** Same JSON shape as `--resource-mapping <file>`, mutually exclusive with it. Useful in non-TTY CI scripts that don't want a separate file.
  - **`--record-resource-mapping <file>`: parity.** cdkd writes the resolved `{logicalId: physicalId}` map to the file before the confirmation prompt (and even when the user says "no" or under `--dry-run`). Covers explicit overrides AND cdkd's tag-based auto-lookup, so this is the canonical way to capture an `auto`-mode resolution and replay it as `--resource-mapping` in CI.
  - **`--force` semantics differ.** Upstream: "continue even if the diff has updates/deletions." cdkd: "overwrite an existing state record." Same flag name, different meaning — do not confuse them when reading PRs / issues.
  - **`auto` and `hybrid` modes are cdkd-specific** (whole-stack tag-based import via `aws:cdk:path`). No upstream equivalent. Do not mistake them for parity features.
  - **Nested CloudFormation stacks (`AWS::CloudFormation::Stack`) are unsupported on both sides.** cdkd has no `AWS::CloudFormation::Stack` provider, so these resources show up as `unsupported` in the import summary. CDK Stages (separate top-level stacks under one app) work fine.
  - **No CDK bootstrap version requirement.** cdkd uses its own S3 state bucket; the upstream "bootstrap v12+" caveat does not apply.

  `state` is a parent command for inspecting and manipulating cdkd's S3 state bucket: `state info` prints bucket name, region (auto-detected via `GetBucketLocation`), the source that resolved the bucket (`cli-flag` / `env` / `cdk.json` / `default` / `default-legacy`), the schema version, and a stack count (with `--json` for tooling); `state list` (alias `ls`) lists deployed stacks (one row per `(stackName, region)` pair under the new region-prefixed key layout); `state resources <stack>` and `state show <stack>` accept `--stack-region <region>` to disambiguate when the same stackName has state in multiple regions; `state orphan <stack>...` removes cdkd's state record for every region by default, or scopes to one with `--stack-region <region>` (does NOT delete AWS resources — name mirrors aws-cdk-cli's new `cdk orphan`); `cdkd orphan <constructPath>...` is the synth-driven, **per-resource** counterpart (mirrors upstream `cdk orphan --unstable=orphan`) — it removes specific resources from a stack's state file by construct path (`MyStack/MyTable`), live-fetching every `Fn::GetAtt` it has to substitute via the resource's `provider.getAttribute()` (cached per `(orphan, attr)`) and rewriting every sibling `Ref` / `Fn::GetAtt` / `Fn::Sub` / `dependencies` reference so the next deploy doesn't try to re-create the orphan or fail on a stale reference; unresolvable references hard-fail with a one-shot list of every site, and `--force` falls back to the orphan's `state.attributes` cache (logging a per-case warning) before leaving the original intrinsic untouched if the cache also lacks the attr; `--dry-run` prints the rewrite audit table without acquiring a lock or saving state. The implementation lives in `src/analyzer/orphan-rewriter.ts` (the recursion structure mirrors `IntrinsicFunctionResolver` but in the inverse direction: only orphan references are substituted, every other intrinsic is left alone) and `src/cli/cdk-path.ts` (the shared `aws:cdk:path` index, also used by `cdkd import`). The pre-PR `cdkd orphan <stack>` whole-stack behavior is gone — the command hard-fails with a redirect message that points to `cdkd state orphan <stack>` instead of silently routing. `state destroy <stack>...` deletes AWS resources AND the state record without requiring the CDK app (the CDK-app-free counterpart to `cdkd destroy`). The per-stack destroy logic is hoisted into `src/cli/commands/destroy-runner.ts` and shared by both `cdkd destroy` and `cdkd state destroy`. `state migrate` copies all state from the legacy region-suffixed default bucket (`cdkd-state-{accountId}-{region}`) to the new region-free default (`cdkd-state-{accountId}`); refuses to run while any stack has an active lock; verifies object-count parity before any source cleanup; source bucket is kept by default and only deleted with `--remove-legacy`. The bucket-name banner is no longer printed in routine command output (it includes the AWS account id, which would leak via screenshots / public CI logs); pass `--verbose` to surface it in debug logs, or use `state info` for an explicit on-demand answer.

### SDK Providers

SDK Providers are in `src/provisioning/providers/`. See [README](../README.md) for the full list of supported resource types. Registration is centralized in `src/provisioning/register-providers.ts`.

SDK Providers are preferred over Cloud Control API for performance -- they make direct synchronous API calls with no polling overhead. Cloud Control API is used as a fallback for resource types without an SDK Provider.

## State Schema

```typescript
interface StackState {
  version: 1 | 2;       // 1 = legacy, 2 = region-prefixed (current writers)
  stackName: string;
  region?: string;      // Required on version: 2 (load-bearing for the S3 key)
  resources: Record<string, ResourceState>;
  outputs: Record<string, string>;
  lastModified: number;
}

interface ResourceState {
  physicalId: string;           // AWS physical ID
  resourceType: string;         // e.g., "AWS::S3::Bucket"
  properties: Record<string, any>;
  attributes: Record<string, any>;  // For Fn::GetAtt resolution
  dependencies: string[];       // For proper deletion order
}
```

## Provider Pattern

```typescript
interface ResourceProvider {
  create(logicalId: string, resourceType: string, properties: Record<string, unknown>): Promise<ResourceCreateResult>;
  update(physicalId: string, logicalId: string, resourceType: string, oldProperties: Record<string, unknown>, newProperties: Record<string, unknown>): Promise<void>;
  delete(physicalId: string, logicalId: string, resourceType: string, properties: Record<string, unknown>, context?: { expectedRegion?: string }): Promise<void>;
  getAttribute(physicalId: string, logicalId: string, resourceType: string, attributeName: string): Promise<any>;
}
```

The `context.expectedRegion` parameter on `delete` is the region recorded
in the stack state when the resource was created. Providers MUST verify
the AWS client's region against `context.expectedRegion` (via the shared
`assertRegionMatch()` helper in `src/provisioning/region-check.ts`)
before treating a `*NotFound` error as idempotent delete success — see
"DELETE idempotency" below and `docs/provider-development.md`.

Register Provider for each resource type in Provider Registry:

```typescript
const registry = ProviderRegistry.getInstance();
registry.register('AWS::IAM::Role', new IAMRoleProvider());
```

## Important Implementation Details

### 1. ESM Modules

- `package.json` specifies `"type": "module"`
- All imports must include `.js` extension (even in TypeScript)

  ```typescript
  import { foo } from './bar.js';  // ✅ Correct
  import { foo } from './bar';     // ❌ Wrong
  ```

### 2. Build System (esbuild)

- Uses esbuild in `build.mjs`
- graphlib has special handling for ESM compatibility

### 3. CLI Configuration Resolution

- `--app` (`-a`) is optional: falls back to `CDKD_APP` env var, then `cdk.json` `"app"` field. Accepts either a shell command (`"npx ts-node app.ts"`) or a path to a pre-synthesized cloud assembly directory (`cdk.out`); when a directory is given, synthesis is skipped and the manifest is read directly.
- `--state-bucket` is optional: falls back to `CDKD_STATE_BUCKET` env var, then `cdk.json` `context.cdkd.stateBucket`
- `--region` is **bootstrap-only** as of PR 5 (`docs/plans/05-region-flag-cleanup.md`). `cdkd bootstrap` uses it to pick the region of the new state bucket; every other command (`deploy`, `destroy`, `diff`, `synth`, `list`, `state`, `force-unlock`, `publish-assets`) accepts `--region` for backward compatibility but emits a deprecation warning and ignores the value — provisioning clients pick up the region from `AWS_REGION` / the AWS profile, and the state-bucket client auto-detects the bucket's region via `GetBucketLocation` (PR 3).
- `--context` / `-c` is optional: accepts `key=value` pairs (repeatable), merged with cdk.json context (CLI takes precedence)
- Stack names are positional arguments: `cdkd deploy MyStack` (not `--stack-name`)
- `--all` flag targets all stacks for deploy/diff/destroy (`destroy --all` only targets stacks from the current CDK app via synthesis)
- Wildcard support: `cdkd deploy 'My*'`
- Stack selection accepts both forms (CDK CLI parity): the **physical** CloudFormation stack name (`MyStage-MyStack`) and the **hierarchical display path** from CDK synth (`MyStage/MyStack`). Patterns containing `/` are matched against the display path; patterns without `/` are matched against the physical name. This makes Stage-scoped wildcards like `cdkd deploy 'MyStage/*'` work as expected. For `destroy`, display-path matching requires synth to succeed (state alone only carries physical names). Implemented in `src/cli/stack-matcher.ts`.
- Single stack auto-detected (no stack name needed)
- `cdkd list` (alias `ls`) — CDK CLI parity. Default output: each stack's CDK display id on its own line, ordered by dependency — `<displayPath> (<physicalStackName>)` when the two differ (Stage-scoped stacks), else just the display path. `--long` / `-l` emits structured `{id, name, environment, [dependencies]}` records (YAML, or JSON with `--json`); `--show-dependencies` / `-d` emits `{id, dependencies}` pairs (id uses the same parens form). Positional patterns filter by physical name or display path with the same routing rules as deploy/diff/destroy. No state bucket / AWS credentials needed beyond what synthesis itself requires.
- Concurrency options: `--concurrency` (resource ops, default 10), `--stack-concurrency` (stacks, default 4), `--asset-publish-concurrency` (S3+ECR, default 8), `--image-build-concurrency` (Docker builds, default 4)
- Per-resource timeout options (deploy + destroy + state destroy): `--resource-warn-after <duration_or_type=duration>` (default `5m`) and `--resource-timeout <duration_or_type=duration>` (default `30m`). Both flags are **repeatable** and accept either form per invocation: a bare `<duration>` (`30m`) sets the global default; `<TYPE>=<duration>` (`AWS::CloudFront::Distribution=1h`) adds a per-resource-type override. At each per-resource call site, resolution is `perTypeMs[resourceType] ?? globalMs ?? compileTimeDefault` for both the warn timer and the hard timeout, so the override wins for matching resources only. Wraps each individual provider call (CREATE / UPDATE / DELETE in `provisionResource()` / `runDestroyForStack`'s per-resource delete loop) in a `Promise.race`-based deadline. The warn timer mutates the live renderer's task label in place (`[taking longer than expected, Nm+]`) and emits a `logger.warn` line via `printAbove`; the hard timer throws `ResourceTimeoutError` which is caught and wrapped as `ProvisioningError` at the same site as any other provider failure, so the existing rollback / state-preservation path runs unchanged. Defaults to 30m (NOT 1h) on purpose — Custom-Resource-heavy stacks should pass `--resource-timeout 1h` explicitly (or scope the bump per-type, e.g. `--resource-timeout AWS::CloudFront::Distribution=1h --resource-timeout AWS::RDS::DBCluster=1h30m`) because the Custom Resource provider's polling cap is 1h. Durations accept `<n>s`/`<n>m`/`<n>h`; zero, negative, missing-unit, unknown-unit, malformed `TYPE` (must look like `AWS::Service::Resource`), and `warn >= timeout` (both globally and per-type) are all rejected at parse time. Helper at `src/deployment/resource-deadline.ts`; CLI parser at `src/cli/options.ts` (`parseResourceTimeoutToken` builds a `ResourceTimeoutOption = { globalMs?, perTypeMs }`); resolution helper `effectiveResourceTimeoutMs(resourceType, opt, fallbackMs)`. The cancellation is `Promise.race`-style — the underlying provider call keeps running for some time after the timer fires; threading `AbortController` through every provider is deferred.
- `-y` / `--yes` is a global flag (CDK CLI parity) that auto-confirms interactive prompts (e.g. `destroy`). `cdkd destroy` additionally accepts `-f` / `--force` — a destroy-specific flag with the same effect as `-y` in this context (matching CDK CLI, where `--force` is per-subcommand and overlaps with the global `--yes` only in the destroy confirmation path)
- Implemented in `src/cli/config-loader.ts`

- CDK Provider framework: isCompleteHandler/onEventHandler async pattern detection
- Async CRUD with polling (max 1hr), pre-signed URL validity 2hr
- Implemented in `CustomResourceProvider`

### 5. Synthesis

- Synthesis orchestration (no external CDK toolkit dependencies; CDK app itself generates templates)
- `AppExecutor` runs CDK app as subprocess with env vars (CDK_OUTDIR, CDK_CONTEXT_JSON, CDK_DEFAULT_REGION, etc.)
- `AssemblyReader` parses Cloud Assembly manifest.json directly (recursively traverses nested assemblies for CDK Stage support)
- `Synthesizer` orchestrates synthesis with context provider loop for missing context resolution
- Context providers: see `src/synthesis/context-providers/` for full list (in `src/synthesis/context-providers/`)
- `ContextStore` manages cdk.context.json read/write

### 6. Asset Publishing

- Self-implemented (no external CDK asset libraries)
- `FileAssetPublisher` handles S3 file upload with ZIP packaging (using `archiver`)
- `DockerAssetPublisher` handles ECR Docker image build & push
- `AssetPublisher` orchestrates using above publishers (standalone `publish-assets` command)
- For `deploy`, `WorkGraph` manages asset nodes directly: file assets as `asset-publish` nodes, Docker assets as `asset-build → asset-publish` node chains
- `AssetManifestLoader` loads asset manifests from cdk.out

### 7. Intrinsic Function Resolution

- Implemented in `IntrinsicResolver` class (`src/analyzer/intrinsic-resolver.ts`)
- Ref: References other resource's PhysicalId
- Fn::GetAtt: Gets resource attributes (from state.attributes)
- Fn::Join: String concatenation
- Fn::Sub: Template string substitution

### 8. Dependency Analysis

- Implemented in `DagBuilder` class (`src/analyzer/dag-builder.ts`)
- Scans template to detect `Ref` / `Fn::GetAtt` / `DependsOn`
- Builds DAG with graphlib
- Determines execution order with topological sort
- **Implicit edge for Custom Resources**: any `AWS::IAM::Policy` / `AWS::IAM::RolePolicy` / `AWS::IAM::ManagedPolicy` attached to a Custom Resource's ServiceToken Lambda execution role automatically gets an edge to the Custom Resource, preventing the handler from being invoked before inline policy attachment returns (avoids mid-deploy AccessDenied race)
- **Implicit edge for Lambda VpcConfig**: every `AWS::EC2::Subnet` / `AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup` referenced by a Lambda's `Properties.VpcConfig.SubnetIds` / `SecurityGroupIds` gets an explicit edge to the Lambda (`src/analyzer/lambda-vpc-deps.ts`). Defense-in-depth on top of `extractDependencies`; for the reversed deletion traversal this guarantees Lambda is removed before its Subnet/SG so the asynchronous ENI detach has time to complete before EC2 rejects the subnet/SG delete with `DependencyViolation`.
- **Type-based deletion ordering rules**: `src/analyzer/implicit-delete-deps.ts` centralizes type-pair rules (e.g. VPC after Subnet, Subnet after Lambda) shared by the deploy DELETE phase and the standalone destroy command.

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

- `tests/unit/**/*.test.ts`
- Uses Vitest
- Mocking: Mock AWS SDK with vi.mock()

### Integration Tests

- `tests/integration/**`
- Uses actual AWS account
- Environment variables: `STATE_BUCKET`, `AWS_REGION`
- Examples verified with real AWS deployments (see `tests/integration/` for full list)

### UPDATE Testing

- Environment variable `CDKD_TEST_UPDATE=true` enables UPDATE test mode
- Example: `tests/integration/basic/lib/basic-stack.ts`
- Allows testing UPDATE operations without modifying code
- JSON Patch (RFC 6902) verified working for S3, Lambda, IAM resources

### Rollback Testing (failure injection)

- Environment variable `CDKD_TEST_FAIL=true` injects a deliberately-failing
  resource (an `AWS::SQS::Queue` with an out-of-range `MessageRetentionPeriod`)
  into the `basic` stack
- Verifies against real AWS that already-completed siblings get rolled back
  when one resource fails: `CDKD_TEST_FAIL=true cdkd deploy CdkdBasicExample`
- After rollback, S3 and SSM Document should both be deleted and state file
  should be empty

## Common Development Tasks

### Adding a New SDK Provider

1. Create new file in `src/provisioning/providers/`
2. Implement `ResourceProvider` interface
3. Register in `src/provisioning/register-providers.ts` within the `registerAllProviders()` function
4. Write tests

See [docs/provider-development.md](docs/provider-development.md) for details.

### Supporting a New Intrinsic Function

1. Extend `resolve()` method in `src/analyzer/intrinsic-resolver.ts`
2. Implement recursive resolution
3. Write tests (`tests/unit/analyzer/intrinsic-resolver.test.ts`)

### Debugging Deploy Flow

1. Use `--verbose` flag
2. Check log level (`src/utils/logger.ts`)
3. Check State file: `aws s3 cp s3://bucket/cdkd/{stackName}/{region}/state.json -`
4. See [docs/troubleshooting.md](docs/troubleshooting.md)

## Known Limitations

- NOT recommended for production use

**Recently Implemented** (2026-03-26):

- ✅ CLI: `--app` and `--state-bucket` optional (fallback to env vars / cdk.json)
- ✅ CLI: Positional stack names, `--all` flag, wildcard support, single stack auto-detection
- ✅ CLI: `cdkd destroy` accepts `--app` option; confirmation accepts y/yes
- ✅ CLI: `cdkd list` / `cdkd ls` (CDK CLI parity) — default per-line display path; `--long`, `--show-dependencies`, `--json` for structured output; reuses shared stack-matcher for pattern filtering
- ✅ Resource replacement: immutable property changes trigger DELETE then CREATE
- ✅ Custom Resource ResponseURL: S3 pre-signed URL for cfn-response handlers
- ✅ CloudFormation Parameters support (with default values and type coercion)
- ✅ Intrinsic functions: Fn::Select, Fn::Split, Fn::If, Fn::Equals, Fn::And, Fn::Or, Fn::Not, Fn::ImportValue
- ✅ Conditions evaluation (with logical operators)
- ✅ Cross-stack references (Fn::ImportValue via S3 state backend)
- ✅ Cloud Control API JSON Patch for updates (RFC 6902 compliant)
- ✅ Resource replacement detection (immutable property detection for 10+ AWS resource types)
- ✅ AWS::NoValue pseudo parameter (for conditional property omission)
- ✅ Fn::FindInMap (Mappings lookup) and Fn::Base64 (base64 encoding)
- ✅ Fn::GetAZs (all intrinsic functions now supported)
- ✅ Per-resource partial state save (prevents orphaned resources mid-deploy)
- ✅ Pre-rollback state save on failure (tracks resources completed concurrently with the failed one)
- ✅ Event-driven DAG dispatch (each resource starts as soon as its own deps complete; no level barrier)
- ✅ CREATE retry with exponential backoff (IAM propagation delays)
- ✅ CC API polling with exponential backoff (1s→2s→4s→8s→10s)
- ✅ Compact output mode (default clean output, `--verbose` for full details)
- ✅ Live progress renderer (`src/utils/live-renderer.ts`) — multi-line in-flight task area at the bottom of the terminal during `deploy` / `destroy`, showing `Creating <logical-id>...` / `Deleting <logical-id>...` lines that disappear as each resource completes. Self-disables on non-TTY and when `CDKD_NO_LIVE=1` (the CLI sets this in `--verbose` mode so debug logs do not interleave with the live area). Multi-stack-aware: scopes each task by the calling stack (via `withStackName` AsyncLocalStorage) so `--stack-concurrency > 1` runs don't collide on the same `logicalId`, and switches to `[<StackName>] <label>` rows whenever more than one stack has tasks in flight (single-stack runs keep the un-prefixed clean form)
- ✅ Per-async-context stack name for resource-name generation (`src/provisioning/resource-name.ts`). Backed by `AsyncLocalStorage`; concurrent deploys (`--stack-concurrency > 1`) each have an isolated scope, so stack A's IAM Role create never picks up stack B's prefix. Use `withStackName(stackName, fn)` to wrap a deploy's body; the legacy `setCurrentStackName` setter now uses `enterWith` and is also concurrency-safe but `withStackName` is preferred at call sites for explicit scoping.
- ✅ Per-stack log buffering for parallel multi-stack deploys (`src/utils/stack-context.ts`). When `cdkd deploy` runs more than one stack at the same time (`--stack-concurrency > 1`), the CLI wraps each stack's body in `runStackBuffered(...)`; the logger detects the active `AsyncLocalStorage` buffer and pushes lines into it instead of writing to stdout. Each stack's buffered block is flushed atomically when the stack finishes, so per-stack output ("Changes: ...", `[N/N] ✅ ...`, "Deployment Summary", "✓ Deployment completed") stays grouped and stack A's "Deployment completed" never lands between stack B's progress lines. Single-stack runs do not buffer (real-time output preferred when there is no interleaving risk).
- ✅ `--state-bucket` auto-resolves from STS account ID: `cdkd-state-{accountId}` (region-free; legacy `cdkd-state-{accountId}-{region}` is still read with a deprecation warning, removed in a future PR — see `docs/plans/04-state-bucket-naming.md`). Bucket name is region-free because S3 names are globally unique; teammates with different profile regions all converge on the same bucket. The bucket's actual region is auto-detected via `GetBucketLocation` (PR 3). When **both** the new and the legacy bucket exist (typical after upgrading from v0.7.0 with a partial migration leaving an empty new bucket), the resolver picks the one that actually has state under `cdkd/` rather than always preferring new — falling back to legacy with a "run cdkd state migrate" warning when new is empty and legacy has state. This keeps `cdkd deploy` from re-creating already-deployed resources after an upgrade.
- ✅ CC API GetResource returns GetAtt-compatible attribute names (no mapping needed)
- ✅ Unit tests, integration examples, E2E test script
- ✅ DeletionPolicy: Retain support (skip deletion for retained resources)
- ✅ Resource replacement for immutable property changes (CREATE→DELETE)
- ✅ Type safety improvements (error handling, any type elimination in custom resources)
- ✅ Dynamic References: `{{resolve:secretsmanager:...}}` and `{{resolve:ssm:...}}`
- ✅ SDK Providers: see SDK Providers section above for full list
- ✅ ALL pseudo parameters supported (7/7 including AWS::StackName/StackId)
- ✅ DELETE idempotency (not-found/No policy found treated as success **only when client region matches state region** — region-mismatched destroys now surface `ProvisioningError` instead of silently stripping resources from state; helper at `src/provisioning/region-check.ts`)
- ✅ Destroy ordering: reverse dependency from state + implicit type-based deps
- ✅ CC API null value stripping + JSON string properties (EventPattern)
- ✅ CC API ClientToken removed (caches failure results, incompatible with retry)
- ✅ Implicit delete dependencies for VPC/IGW/EventBus/Subnet/RouteTable
- ✅ Implicit delete dependency: Subnet/SecurityGroup must be deleted AFTER Lambda::Function (avoids Lambda VpcConfig ENI detach race in DependencyViolation)
- ✅ CloudFront OAI S3CanonicalUserId enrichment
- ✅ DynamoDB StreamArn enrichment via DescribeTable
- ✅ API Gateway RootResourceId enrichment via GetRestApi
- ✅ isRetryableError with HTTP status code (429/503) + cause chain
- ✅ CDK Provider framework: isCompleteHandler/onEventHandler async pattern detection, max 1hr polling, pre-signed URL 2hr
- ✅ Lambda FunctionUrl attribute enrichment (GetFunctionUrlConfig API)
- ✅ CloudFront + Lambda Function URL integration test (6/6 CREATE+DESTROY)
- ✅ Removed attribute-mapper and schema-cache (CC API returns GetAtt-compatible names directly)
- ✅ CDK synthesis orchestration without toolkit-lib (removed @aws-cdk/toolkit-lib and @aws-cdk/cloud-assembly-api)
- ✅ Self-implemented asset publishing (removed @aws-cdk/cdk-assets-lib, using archiver for ZIP)
- ✅ Context providers for missing context resolution (see `src/synthesis/context-providers/` for full list)
- ✅ Cloud Assembly manifest.json direct parsing with custom type definitions
- ✅ Nested cloud assembly traversal (CDK Stage support)
- ✅ WorkGraph DAG orchestrator for asset publishing and stack deployment (build→publish→deploy pipeline)
- ✅ Concurrency options: `--asset-publish-concurrency` (default 8), `--image-build-concurrency` (default 4)
- ✅ Lambda VpcConfig SDK provider support (avoids CC API fallback) + pre-delete VPC detach (UpdateFunctionConfiguration with empty arrays) + wait for LastUpdateStatus=Successful before DeleteFunction (otherwise the in-flight detach is aborted and ENIs stay attached) + ENI Description match by token prefix (CDK-generated function names carry an 8-char suffix that the ENI Description omits) + delstack-style ENI cleanup (filter `description=AWS Lambda VPC ENI-*` — NOT `requester-id=*:awslambda_*`, which never matches because real Lambda hyperplane ENI RequesterIds are AROA principal ids that do not contain the literal string "awslambda" — initial 10s sleep, then per-ENI parallel delete with a 30-minute retry budget) on delete — AWS's hyperplane ENI release is eventually-consistent and can take 5–30 minutes in practice, so a shorter budget races ahead and leaves ENIs attached + side-channel ENI cleanup retry on EC2 Subnet / SecurityGroup delete (last-resort sweep for cases where the Lambda-side cleanup ran out of budget) — `DeleteFunction` alone does not synchronously release Lambda hyperplane ENIs, AWS reclaims them only eventually

## Node.js Version

- **Required**: Node.js >= 20.0.0 (from `package.json` engines field)

## Workflow Rules

- **When adding new functionality or fixing bugs**: Always add corresponding unit tests. Do not wait to be asked.
- **After modifying source code**: Always run `pnpm run build` before telling the user to test. The user runs cdkd via `node dist/cli.js`, so source changes without a build have no effect.
- **Self-review before commit (4 axes)**: Once the implementation feels complete, walk these four axes BEFORE running `/check` and committing — the markgate hook checks that tests pass, not that the work is *good*:
  1. **Implementation gaps** — anything in the agreed scope still missing? (e.g. updated `deploy.ts` but forgot the parallel change in `destroy.ts` / `diff.ts`; tests not added; docs not updated)
  2. **Oddities** — anything in the diff strange or inconsistent? (dead code, leftover names from the old shape, error messages that no longer make sense, half-applied refactors)
  3. **Polish opportunities** — small in-scope improvements you noticed and dismissed as "out of scope"? Default to including them in the same PR if they touch the same files and carry no behavior-break risk; defer only when they belong to a genuinely different concern.
  4. **Regression risk** — full test suite run (not just the new tests)? Any renamed/removed exports that other call-sites might depend on? Any behavior change a reviewer might miss in the diff?

  Surface findings out loud (in chat or todos) and fix them before invoking `/check`. The cost of one more pass is small compared to a follow-up PR or a missed regression.
- **Before every commit**: Two markgate gates guard `git commit` via `.claude/hooks/check-gate.sh`. Both must be fresh:
  - `check` — recorded by `/check` (typecheck, lint, build, tests). Scope: `src/**`, `tests/**`, build/test configs (see `.markgate.yml`). Only invalidated by changes in that scope.
  - `docs` — recorded by `/check-docs` (README.md / CLAUDE.md / docs/ consistency with src). Scope: `src/**`, `docs/**`, `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`. Only invalidated by changes in that scope.

  **Run the required skills proactively** before attempting the commit — look at `git status` / `git diff --cached --name-only` and match it against each gate's scope: a tests-only commit only needs `/check`; a docs-only commit only needs `/check-docs`; a src edit needs both; changes that fall outside both scopes (e.g. `.claude/**`, `.markgate.yml`) need neither. The hook is a safety net, not the primary trigger — if you see "Blocked by check-gate", the message names exactly which skill to re-run, but getting there means you skipped the proactive step. `/verify-pr` refreshes both markers in one shot. Install markgate via `mise install` at the repo root (see CONTRIBUTING.md).
- **Before opening or merging any PR**: A third markgate gate, `verify-pr`, guards `gh pr create` and `gh pr merge` via `.claude/hooks/verify-pr-gate.sh`. Scope: union of `check` + `docs` (everything that could plausibly invalidate the PR-readiness checklist). Only `/verify-pr` sets it, and the skill walks the full checklist — typecheck/lint/build/tests, CI status, working tree, docs consistency, leftover AWS resources, code review (incl. shared-utility caller verification), **live-test of the changed behavior against real or fixture input**, **session retrospective + proposals for new rules / hooks / skills**, and PR title + body freshness vs the diff. So opening or merging a PR whose live behavior was never exercised, or whose retrospective produced no rule proposals for surprises in the session, is **physically blocked** — the hook refuses `gh pr create` / `gh pr merge` until `/verify-pr` is re-run end-to-end. This is the structural enforcement of the "tests passing is not the same as the feature working" + "every recurring surprise should leave a rule behind" lessons.

- **Before merging any PR that touches deletion logic**: A fourth markgate gate, `integ-destroy`, guards `gh pr merge` via `.claude/hooks/integ-destroy-gate.sh`. Scope: `src/provisioning/providers/**`, `src/cli/commands/destroy.ts`, `src/deployment/deploy-engine.ts`, `src/analyzer/dag-builder.ts`, `src/analyzer/implicit-delete-deps.ts`, `src/analyzer/lambda-vpc-deps.ts`. Only `/run-integ` sets it, and only when the destroy step finished with 0 errors AND the post-destroy AWS state was empty. So a PR whose destroy path has not been verified against real AWS is **physically unmergeable** — the hook blocks `gh pr merge` until you run `/run-integ <test>` and it succeeds end-to-end. This is the structural enforcement of the "never merge a PR whose destroy path is unverified" rule below.

- **Other PreToolUse safety hooks**: Two additional one-shot hooks block known foot-guns at the source. `.claude/hooks/commit-msg-heredoc-gate.sh` blocks `git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF' ... EOF)"`-style invocations because outer-shell quote tracking miscounts when the body contains apostrophes / backticks; use `git commit -F <file>` instead. `.claude/hooks/gh-pr-edit-deprecation-gate.sh` blocks `gh pr edit --title` / `--body` because they currently fail SILENTLY on a GraphQL Projects-classic deprecation; use `gh api -X PATCH repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<N> -f title=... -F body=@<file>` instead. Both produce actionable error messages with the exact replacement command.
- **Never commit or push directly to `main`**: All changes must land via a feature branch + PR. Before committing, run `git switch -c <branch>` (e.g., `fix/xxx`, `feat/xxx`, `docs/xxx`). A PreToolUse hook (`.claude/hooks/branch-gate.sh`) blocks `git commit` and `git push` when the current branch is `main` or `master` — if you see "Blocked by branch-gate", create a feature branch and retry.
- **Before creating or merging a PR**: Run `/verify-pr` (adds CI status, docs consistency, AWS resource cleanup, code review on top of `/check`)
- **When running integration tests**: Use `/run-integ` with the appropriate test name (e.g., `/run-integ lambda`). **Never bypass the skill** by manually invoking `cdkd deploy` / `cdkd destroy` from a shell — the skill encodes the deploy + destroy + orphan-resource verification in a single block, and skipping any step (e.g. relying on a successful deploy without running destroy) has historically caused us to merge changes whose destroy path was broken.
- **After running integration tests**: Verify no leftover AWS resources remain (`aws s3 ls s3://cdkd-state-{accountId}/cdkd/` should return empty or error; on accounts that haven't migrated yet, the legacy `cdkd-state-{accountId}-{region}` bucket is still in use — check both). **If the destroy step failed or left orphans, you MUST clean them up via direct AWS API calls before doing anything else** (use `/cleanup` if applicable, otherwise `aws ec2 delete-*` etc.) — leaving orphan resources after an integ run is never acceptable, regardless of whether the test passed.
- **Never merge a PR whose destroy path is unverified**: If a change touches deletion logic (any provider's `delete()`, DAG order on destroy, state cleanup, etc.), the integ test must complete the **destroy** step successfully (not just deploy) before the PR is mergeable. A green CI is necessary but not sufficient — CI does not exercise real-AWS destroy.
- **After fixing documentation or code**: Commit to a feature branch (not `main`) and push immediately. Do not leave uncommitted changes. Before reporting completion to the user, always run `git status` to verify nothing is uncommitted and that you are not on `main`.
- **English-only for committed files**: This is an OSS project. All committed files (source code, shell scripts, hook messages, config files such as `.claude/settings.json`, docs, comments, commit messages, PR titles/bodies) MUST be written in English. Do not use Japanese characters (hiragana, katakana, kanji) in any committed artifact. Conversation with the user in chat may be in Japanese — this rule applies only to files that land in the repository.
