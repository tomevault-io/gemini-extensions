# Repository Guidance

HypAware is the active codebase. Prefer files under `src/`, `hypaware-core/`,
`bin/`, and root `test/`. The old `collectivus/` donor tree is not part of this
repo; do not assume its tests, package scripts, or agent notes are available
unless a task explicitly provides that context.

## Adding things

Make the smallest change that fixes the problem. When a bigger change looks
right, land the small one and defer the rest. File a GitHub issue autonomously
only when the follow-up is concrete, consequential, and clearly outside the
current task. Do not file issues for speculative improvements, minor cleanup,
or observations that are adequately captured in the PR description.

- **No new runtime dependencies.** Use the standard library and the code already
  here. If nothing here can do the job, keep the fix small and apply the same
  follow-up threshold above.
- **Do not invent columns, config keys, or schema fields.** Reuse or derive.
  Add one only when the task calls for it, and a rejected one stays rejected.
- **Reuse before you add** a file, helper, wrapper, or abstraction, unless the
  existing one is the wrong home for it.
- **Stop when tests pass.** Note unasked-for docs, cleanups, or adjacent fixes
  in the PR description; do not land them.

## Performance

Performance is a product requirement. Keep CPU work and memory use economical
and bounded, especially in hot paths, per-record work, and long-running
processes. Every code review must include an explicit CPU and memory pass over
the changed code and affected paths. Call out avoidable allocation, repeated
work, unbounded growth, busy loops, and behavior that worsens with data volume
or uptime; state explicitly when the review finds no CPU or memory concern.

## Design docs (LLP)

Design rationale lives in numbered **LLP documents** under `llp/`, following
Linked Literate Programming. Start at [`llp/0000-hypaware.explainer.md`](llp/0000-hypaware.explainer.md)
for the subsystem map, and [LLP 0002](llp/0002-v1-scope.decision.md) for what
actually shipped in V1.

- **Most changes need no LLP.** Bug fixes, null handling, tests, renames,
  behavior-preserving refactors, and version bumps get none. Write one when a
  real design decision is made or changed, not as a record of a fix.
- **Read before you change.** Before modifying a subsystem, read the LLP tagged
  with its `Systems` value (e.g. `Sources`, `Sinks`, `Plugins`, `Config`).
- **Annotate non-obvious decisions.** When you implement or change code that
  realizes a documented, non-obvious design decision, add an annotation:
  `// @ref LLP NNNN#anchor: short gloss` (with an optional relation before the
  colon: `[implements]`, `[constrained-by]`, `[tests]`, e.g.
  `// @ref LLP NNNN#anchor [implements]: short gloss`). Attach it directly above
  the construct; a blank line breaks attachment. Don't annotate mechanically; a
  ref must tell you something the code and filename don't.
- **Keep refs honest.** When you touch annotated code, check the referenced
  section still applies; update or remove the `@ref` if not.
- **Living docs.** Update the LLP when the design changes: land the doc edit in
  the same commit as the code. Mark retired docs `Superseded` or move them to
  `llp/tombstones/` with `Status: Tombstoned`; don't leave stale guidance.
- **Accepted docs are settled.** Once an LLP is `Accepted` or `Active`, do not
  edit what it settled. Change the design by extending it (a new LLP, noted on
  the old doc's `Extended-by:` line) or by replacing it with a new LLP and
  marking the old one `Superseded`. Mechanical edits are still fine: typos,
  broken links, status changes, and renumbering that does not change meaning
  (LLP 0156).
- **Tooling lives in-repo** under `.claude/skills/` (so every clone has it):
  `/ref-check [path]` validates `@ref`s; `/ref-story <file>` shows a file's
  rationale-order view; `/llp-create <title>` scaffolds a new doc; `/llp-list`
  surveys the corpus; `/llp-grill` stress-tests a plan against the LLP corpus
  before you write code.
- **A new number comes from `node scripts/llp-numbers.js next`**, after a
  `git fetch --prune`. Numbers are minted on every branch at once, so the tree
  you have checked out is not the corpus: three branches each read
  `max(llp/) + 1` and each got the same answer (issue #907). The same script
  gates it: `check` in the `cross-branch-numbers` CI job, which fetches every
  branch first, and in `npm test` wherever the clone carries them (a shallow or
  single-branch checkout skips it and says so). `survey` shows every collision
  across every ref.

## Code Style

- JavaScript, no semicolons.
- No em dashes (the U+2014 character) anywhere: code, comments, JSDoc, strings,
  or docs. In prose, use the punctuation the sentence wants (a comma, colon,
  parentheses, or a sentence split); in runtime strings, prefer `-`.
- No raw NUL bytes (U+0000) in tracked text. grep classifies a file holding one
  as binary and silently skips it, so the file drops out of every text search
  with no error to say so. When a string genuinely needs a NUL (a dedup-key
  separator, say), write the escape `\0`: it yields the same value and keeps the
  bytes on disk searchable.
- Types are defined in JSDoc comments, not TypeScript.
- Never use inline `import('...')` types. Declare type imports at the top of
  the file with `@import` JSDoc comments, then reference the bare names.
- Do not use `@typedef` in JSDoc. Define shared types as `interface`s in
  `.d.ts` files and import them via `@import`.
- **Type-import specifiers are repo-root-anchored `.js` paths.** Inside `src/`,
  write `@import { Foo } from '../../src/core/types.js'` (route up to the repo
  root, then back down through `src/...`, with a `.js` extension), not
  `from './types.d.ts'`. The published declaration build (`npm run build:types`,
  `tsconfig.build.json`, `rootDir: src` to `outDir: types`) emits `.d.ts` into a
  parallel `types/` tree; a root-anchored specifier resolves identically from
  both `src/<P>/x.js` and the generated `types/<P>/x.d.ts`, so consumers of the
  published package get real types instead of `any`. A bare `./types.d.ts`
  resolves in `src` but dangles in `types/`. Imports of the root kernel contract
  (`hypaware-plugin-kernel-types.js`) and `hypaware-core/...` already reach
  the root, so they only need the `.js` extension. This is the icebird-style
  no-copy convention.

## Development Checks

- Run `npm test` for the active traditional test suite. It is intentionally
  scoped to root `test/**/*.test.js`.
- Add traditional tests for deterministic logic: config parsing and validation,
  manifest validation, daemon install rendering, path helpers, TOML transforms,
  OTLP flatteners, sink scheduling, and similar local contracts.
- Use `npm run smoke -- <flow>` for the existing hermetic smoke flows under
  `hypaware-core/smoke/flows`.
- Do not treat the hermetic smokes as the only release gate. They run with a
  temp `HYP_HOME` and `HYP_DEV_TELEMETRY=1`, which is useful for deterministic
  regression checks but does not prove installed-daemon behavior.
- Use `scripts/sandbox/hyp-sandbox` to exercise install methods (`npx`,
  `npm install -g`, `hyp init`, `hyp join`/`leave`, attach, daemon install)
  without touching your own install. It redirects `HOME`, `HYP_HOME`, and the
  npm global prefix into a throwaway root, and puts mock `launchctl` /
  `security` / `systemctl` first on `PATH` so those calls never reach your real
  launchd domain or login keychain (both are per-uid, so a temp `HOME` alone
  does not sandbox them). See
  [`scripts/sandbox/README.md`](scripts/sandbox/README.md).

## Smoke Test Model

Keep two tiers distinct:

1. Traditional tests: fast, deterministic, and broad over edge cases.
2. Hermetic smokes: narrow complete workflows in a temp install, good for PR
   confidence and plugin/kernel wiring checks.

## Log-Driven Development

When adding or changing workflows, make the app observable enough that failures
identify the broken step rather than only returning a nonzero exit code.

- Give every smoke a stable `DEV_RUN_ID`, `smoke_name`, and `smoke_step`.
- Emit structured logs/spans/metrics around entrypoints, lifecycle transitions,
  external calls, retries, validation decisions, source/sink starts, and error
  paths.
- Prefer structured attributes such as `component`, `operation`, `status`,
  `error_kind`, plugin names, dataset names, and sink/source ids.
- Verify both external behavior and emitted telemetry. A smoke should assert
  the user-visible result and the internal signal that proves the intended path
  ran.
- Keep dev telemetry local and secret-safe. Do not record credentials, raw
  prompts, private customer data, or hidden reasoning. Use hashes or short
  redacted excerpts when payload identity matters.
- After a smoke failure, inspect the run-specific logs/spans/metrics before
  changing code. Fix from evidence, then rerun the same smoke.

Useful commands:

```sh
npm test
npm run smoke -- core_boot_noop
npm run smoke -- gateway_codex_capture
npm run smoke -- daemon_foreground_start_stop
```

## Session hygiene

- Close working sessions at the end of the day. Before closing a session you
  intend to continue, ask the agent for a continuation summary: open questions,
  key file paths, decisions made, and the next step. Start the next day's
  session from that summary instead of reopening the old session.
- A session reopened on a later day re-reads its entire history on every
  exchange. If a session has crossed a day boundary and its history no longer
  informs the current step, start fresh.
- Long autonomous runs (loops, overnight workflows) are exempt: they manage
  their own context.

## Edit rules

- Read a file (or the region you will change) before your first Edit to it in
  a session, and re-read it before retrying any failed Edit; the failure
  usually means the file changed underneath you (a formatter or another agent).
- If the same Edit fails twice, stop retrying: re-read, rebuild the edit from
  the current content, or fall back to Write.

## Release checklist

Run before tagging a new HypAware release:

```sh
npm test                  # if a test script is present
npm run typecheck         # if a typecheck script is present
npm pack --dry-run        # verify the published file set
```

Re-run the smoke battery and confirm every one is green:

```sh
hyp dev smoke package_bin_boot
hyp dev smoke cli_bundled_plugins_activated
hyp dev smoke daemon_foreground_start_stop
hyp dev smoke daemon_install_render
hyp dev smoke walkthrough_picker_to_first_query
hyp dev smoke client_attach_idempotent
hyp dev smoke gateway_claude_capture
hyp dev smoke gateway_codex_capture
hyp dev smoke claude_telemetry_capture
hyp dev smoke hypignore_capture_drop
hyp dev smoke local_only_export_withhold
hyp dev smoke source_optout_export_withhold
hyp dev smoke github_local_only_withhold
hyp dev smoke opencode_capture
hyp dev smoke cursor_capture
hyp dev smoke pi_capture
hyp dev smoke github_local_capture
hyp dev smoke otel_loopback_capture
hyp dev smoke local_parquet_export
hyp dev smoke query_grep_roundtrip
hyp dev smoke status_diagnostics
```

Finally, exercise the manual gate end-to-end on at least one macOS host
and one Linux host:

```sh
npm pack
npx ./hypaware-*.tgz
hypaware status
hypaware daemon restart
hypaware query sql "select count(*) from ai_gateway_messages"
hypaware query sql "select count(*) from traces"
hypaware query sql "select count(*) from logs"
hypaware daemon uninstall
```

If the release changes what bounds an automatic import (`backfill.window_days`,
`backfill.sweep_cron`, or the window the scheduled sweep resolves), say so in
the release notes and name every adapter the change reaches. The bounding is
cross-plugin, and one such bound is already in force: as of
v1.31.0 a provider's positive `backfill.window_days` narrows its scheduled
recovery sweep as well as its join-time import
([LLP 0359 #sweep-context](llp/0359-bounded-scheduled-backfill.decision.md#sweep-context)),
OpenClaw's Lane B transcript sweep included, so a window an operator set only
to keep the first import small also caps every later recovery. Nothing is
removed from disk, and widening or dropping the window lets the next sweep
take the older history.

## LLP conventions

Design rationale lives in numbered **LLP** documents under `llp/`, driven by neutral.

- **Immutable docs; change is a new request.** An Accepted/Active LLP is a
  *record*, not a worksheet: do not edit what it decided or required. To change
  intent, mint a **new request** (`rfc`/`spec`/`issue`) that `@ref`s what it
  supersedes, and append a `Superseded-by:`/`Extended-by: LLP NNNN` forward-ref to
  the applicable parts of the old doc. Trivial editorial fixes (typos, links,
  forward-refs) are fine; Drafts are still editable.
