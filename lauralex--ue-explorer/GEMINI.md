# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to Codex (Codex.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository purpose

This is the **Rocket League fork** of [UE Explorer](https://github.com/UE-Explorer/UE-Explorer) — a Windows GUI for browsing and decompiling Unreal Engine 1/2/3 packages (`.upk`, `.u`). The fork's reason to exist is that Rocket League ships heavily customized UnrealScript bytecode: licensee-modified opcode table, custom extended-native opcodes, custom variadic-array natives, etc. Most ongoing work in this repo is **adding/fixing tokens under `UELib/src/Branch/UE3/RL/`** so that RL packages decompile to readable script.

RL packages are encrypted; UELib does not decrypt them. They must first be processed with [RLUPKTool](https://github.com/AltimorTASDK/RLUPKTool) before being opened.

## ⚠️ Validation discipline (read first)

**Every claim in this file and in `UELib/src/Branch/UE3/RL/snapshots/*.md` is a
snapshot in time. Past sessions have committed wrong claims** — the most recent
example was a warning that `sub_7FF6CD38C840` was NOT the real parser; it
actually IS, and the wrong warning misled work for hours before the user pointed
it out. Treat every documented byte→token mapping, handler-address assertion, or
"verified" wire format as a *hypothesis to re-check*, not as ground truth.

**Before acting on a documented claim:**
1. **Verify the binary still matches.** Re-decompile the cited handler in IDA,
   re-read `UStruct::SerializeExpr`'s case for the byte, or re-disassemble a
   function that exercises the byte. Do NOT skip this step even if the claim
   looks recent.
2. **If the claim contradicts what you observe, STOP and ask the user.** Do not
   silently "correct" the doc and proceed — the discrepancy might mean either
   the doc is stale OR your observation is misreading the binary, and the user
   has context (RL build version, which IDB is open, recent fixtures, anything
   they tested manually) that you don't.
3. **After verifying or correcting, update the doc in the same commit as the
   work that depends on it.** Stale claims compound across sessions.

**What this looks like in practice:**
- Memory says "byte 0x2C = StatementWrapper" but the cooked bytecode at the
  site has 3 sub-expressions following → STOP, ask "the runtime handler reads
  1 sub + 1 byte but the cooked stream has more — should I cross-check
  `UStruct::SerializeExpr`?"
- Sentinel function listed as "currently broken" decompiles cleanly → STOP,
  ask "the doc marks `IsGroundHit` as broken but the current output is clean
  — has this been fixed since the doc was written?"
- Stock UE3 says `EX_X = 0xYY`, RL snapshot says different byte → that's
  normal (RL rotates), but verify the current byte by checking BOTH the v868
  GNatives table AND `UStruct::SerializeExpr`, never by trusting either alone.

## Test packages — version pitfall

When verifying token-map changes against actual bytecode, the `.upk` files **must come from the same RL build** as whatever binary is open in IDA / being reverse-engineered. RL rotates its opcode permutation across patches, so a SerializeExpr in the current binary can dispatch byte `0x3E` as EndFunctionParms while older `.upk` files on disk still emit `0x4C` for the same role. A version mismatch silently invalidates every shape inference made from the binary.

To produce a fresh, version-matched fixture set:

```pwsh
# 1. Copy the canonical script packages (TAGame, Core, ProjectX, Engine, IpDrv, GFxUI,
#    GuidCache, Startup, WinDrv) from the live install:
Copy-Item "D:\Games\rocketleague\TAGame\CookedPCConsole\TAGame.upk" `
          "C:\Users\Authority\Desktop\RE stuff\rldecrypted\absolutelynewupks\"
# (repeat for each package)

# 2. Decrypt each in place — RLUPKTool writes a new decrypted file alongside the input:
& "C:\Users\Authority\Desktop\RE stuff\rldecrypted\RLUPKTool.exe" `
  "C:\Users\Authority\Desktop\RE stuff\rldecrypted\absolutelynewupks\TAGame.upk"
```

Then load the **decrypted** output via the uelib MCP (`mcp__uelib__load_package` with `build_target: "RocketLeague"`) and disassemble. Older fixtures under `rldecrypted\`, `rldecrypted\upkbackup\`, `rldecrypted\newupks\`, `rldecrypted\newupks2\` are from earlier RL versions and should not be used to validate work derived from a newer binary.

After decryption, class names in the loaded package have **no namespace prefix**: pass `Actor` to `mcp__uelib__disassemble_function` / `decompile_function`, not `Engine.Actor`. (The package summary's `path` shows `Engine_decrypted` so the qualified path would be `Engine_decrypted.Actor`, but the bare name resolves correctly.)

## Iterating on UELib code with the MCP server attached

The Codex MCP launches `UELib/MCP/publish/Eliot.UELib.MCP.exe` once per session and holds an exclusive lock on it. So the normal `dotnet publish ... -o UELib/MCP/publish` rebuild fails with "process cannot access the file" while a session is live.

Workflow that works (PowerShell automation — much faster than the manual stop/copy/restart):

1. Make code changes (any project — both `Eliot.UELib` and `Eliot.UELib.MCP` get bundled).
2. Build into a sibling directory:
   ```pwsh
   dotnet publish UELib/MCP/Eliot.UELib.MCP.csproj `
       -c Release -r win-x64 -p:PublishSingleFile=true --self-contained true `
       -o UELib/MCP/publish_new
   ```
3. Hot-swap: kill the live MCP process, atomically replace the exe, the user reconnects via `/mcp`:
   ```pwsh
   Get-Process -Name "Eliot.UELib.MCP" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Stop-Process -Force
   Start-Sleep -Milliseconds 500
   Move-Item "UELib\MCP\publish_new\Eliot.UELib.MCP.exe" "UELib\MCP\publish\Eliot.UELib.MCP.exe" -Force
   ```
4. Ask the user to run `/mcp` to reconnect. The user's existing handle from before is invalid; reload packages.

`publish_new/` is gitignored-by-convention (don't commit). It exists only as the build target while `publish/` holds the locked-by-MCP active exe.

**Cost-saving rule.** Each rebuild+reconnect cycle costs ~30s + the user's attention. Do as much investigation/multi-byte-fixing as possible in one batch before requesting the rebuild — see "Testing workflow" below for the prescribed loop.

## Testing workflow — wrong outputs MUST be caught from your own testing

The decompiler can silently produce structurally-broken output (orphan tokens, wrong assignments, empty if-bodies, mangled cast patterns) without throwing. Don't rely on the user to flag bad outputs. **Decompile a sentinel sample after every batch of token-map changes and compare against the prior baseline before declaring done.**

### Sentinel function set (covers most opcode shapes)

These functions span the common bytecode patterns. After each rebuild, decompile each and confirm no regression:

### Loop

```
while not done:
  edit token map / token classes
  dotnet publish ... -o publish_new
  swap exe + reconnect /mcp
  for each sentinel function:
    decompile_function(class, function)
    eyeball for: orphan tokens, "/* truncated */", "/* unresolved cast */",
                 empty if/while bodies, vect() with absurd values,
                 ".*" inside operator slots, multiple consecutive `return`,
                 `__NFUN_NNN__` ghost natives, bare names with no operator
  if any regression: revert, retry differently
```

### Output smells (red flags)

- **`/* unresolved cast */()`** — current 0x19 (now dynarray dispatcher) was producing this; if it reappears, that byte was remapped wrong.
- **`vect(0, 0, -9.52e21)`** literal where the LHS isn't a vector — a multi-byte-read token (VectorConst, RotationConst) was placed at a byte that doesn't actually emit 12 bytes of payload.
- **`obj.*Name`** with a star — `DelegatePropertyToken` rendering with a synthesized FName from the import table; sometimes legitimate, sometimes a name-resolution artifact.
- **Empty `{}` followed by an orphan `return X;`** — the JumpIfNot's CodeOffset placed the body bound BEFORE its actual content (not a token-map issue, a position/storage scaling thing — see "Position vs Storage" below).
- **`,,,,,` with leading/trailing commas inside a call** — usually `EmptyParmToken` chain for omitted optional args; legitimate but verbose.
- **`__NFUN_<index>__(...)`** — a chained-native dispatcher emitted a placeholder for a native at an index that has no real entry in GNatives. Typically means an over-consuming primary opcode mapping is reading bytes that the parser then dispatches as natives.
- **Bare `.` `=` `==` operators dangling** — a 2-or-more-sub Let/Comparison consumed only one sub successfully and the operator orphans.

### When testing reveals a bad mapping

Always verify against the **binary handler**, not the rendered output. The 0x21 case is the canonical lesson: it was mapped to `DynamicArrayIteratorToken` because the rendered text said `foreach`, but the binary handler at `GNatives[0x21]` reads only 1 sub-expression — the `foreach` was a *consequence* of the wrong mapping, not the evidence for it. Use `mcp__ida-pro-mcp__decompile` on `GNatives[byte * 8] -> handler_addr` and read the actual sub-expression count + payload reads.

## Pitfalls — read before mapping a new byte

### Tautological mapping (the 0x21 trap)
A byte mapping is *tautological* when it's chosen because the rendered output looks plausible, not because the binary handler actually has that wire format. The 0x21 case: rendered as `foreach` because mapped to `DynamicArrayIteratorToken`, which made the rendered text say `foreach`, which "verified" the mapping. The binary handler at `GNatives[0x21]` reads only **one** sub-expression — incompatible with DynArrayIterator's 4-sub + byte + u16 layout. Always derive the wire format from `mcp__ida-pro-mcp__decompile` of the handler, never from the rendered output.

### Use stock UE3 source as the wire-format reference
Stock UE3 source is checked out at `C:\Users\Authority\Desktop\C++ projects\UnrealEngine3`. Two files matter for opcode work:
- `Development\Src\Core\Inc\UnStack.h` — defines the `EExprToken` enum with stock byte values (e.g. `EX_Conditional = 0x45`, `EX_DebugInfo = 0x41`). RL rotates these byte values, but the *wire format per opcode* (3 subs + 2 u16, etc.) is the same in this fork.
- `Development\Src\Core\Inc\ScriptSerialization.h` — contains the giant switch (included into `UStruct::SerializeExpr` in `UnClass.cpp`) with one case per `EX_*` opcode and the exact wire format (XFER macros for byte/word/UField/UProperty, recursive `SerializeExpr` calls for sub-expressions). Search this when you need to know "what shape does EX_Foo have on disk".

Workflow when a byte's wire format is unclear: pick a stock `EX_X` you suspect a v868 byte maps to, read its case in `ScriptSerialization.h`, then locate the matching wire format in `UStruct__SerializeExpr` (sub_7FF6CD38C840) — the byte that produces that identical shape is RL's rotation of `EX_X`.

### Position vs Storage scaling
Cooked RL bytecode stores object pointers as 4-byte indices on disk but expands them to 8-byte pointers in memory. The parser tracks both `Position` (in-memory, after expansion) and `StoragePosition` (on-disk, before expansion). They diverge as the parser encounters object/property reads.

JumpIfNot's u16 `CodeOffset` is read from the on-disk u16 but interpreted as an in-memory `Position`. For functions with deep object-laden conditions, this can place the if-body's `NestEnd` offset *before* the body's actual content (visible as `if(...) {} return X;` empty-body patterns where the `return` is the actual if-body). Don't try to fix this with token-map remaps — the bytes are parsed correctly; the issue is the offset interpretation.

### NRE recovery is load-bearing
The central deserialize loop in `ByteCodeDecompiler.cs` catches per-token exceptions and resyncs `ScriptPosition` to the buffer cursor (or +1 to guarantee progress). Many existing tests assume this catches drift from NTL mismatches, stale import-table indices, etc. **Don't add a `break` in the catch branch** — that was the original behavior and it killed parsing of every function that hit a recoverable error.

### Byte counts, not byte values
When picking a token class for a newly-RE'd byte, the binary's wire format defines the byte count and structure. UE token classes are interchangeable as long as their `Deserialize` methods consume the same bytes. Two different bytes with identical wire formats can map to the same token class — the dispatch lookup is by byte, the `Deserialize` is by class.

### Variadic terminator (0x3E)
`EndFunctionParmsToken` at 0x3E is the variadic-call argument-list terminator. `FunctionToken.DeserializeCall` does an `is EndFunctionParmsToken` type check to end the parm loop. **Don't map any other byte to `EndFunctionParmsToken`** — doing so causes function calls to terminate early when that byte appears in the args. (Historical bug: 0x45 was wrongly mapped to `EndFunctionParmsToken`, and any function with a 0x45 byte in its args got truncated.)

### Decompiler/parse-recovery invariants

The bytecode parse and decompile pipeline has been hardened to recover from per-token failures (NTL drift, stale import-table indices, unmapped opcode bytes). When making further changes, keep these invariants:

- **`ByteCodeDecompiler.Deserialize`'s catch branch must keep advancing `ScriptPosition`.** Originally it `break`-ed on any per-token exception, killing parsing of the rest of the function. The current behavior re-syncs `ScriptPosition` to the buffer cursor (or +1 to guarantee progress) and continues. If you reintroduce a `break`, all NTL-related cascades will once again abort entire functions.
- **Do NOT make `Token.NextToken()` return a clamped/sentinel token when out of range — IT WILL HANG.** Many callers loop with patterns like `while (NextToken() is not Foo)` or `do { t = NextToken(); } while (string.IsNullOrEmpty(...))`. If `NextToken` keeps returning the same token without advancing, those loops spin forever. The correct pattern is bounds-check at each call site (see `DecompileParms` and `DecompileOperator` in `FunctionTokens.cs` for examples). `DecompileNext` *can* safely return `string.Empty` when out of range because string-concat callers continue cleanly.
- **`DecompileNests` must check `CurrentTokenIndex` against `DeserializedTokens.Count` before reading `CurrentToken`.** After parse-recovery, the cursor can walk past the list end. Without this guard, the entire decompile fails with "Failed to format nests!" trace dumps.
- **Tokens with `ReadObject<T>()` lookups should be defensive in RL forks** (e.g. `FinalFunctionTokenRL` catches the `Imports[]` `ArgumentOutOfRangeException`). The base classes can't be made defensive without breaking other UE3 forks. If you add a new RL token that reads object/property/function references, wrap the read in try/catch and fall through to `DeserializeCall(stream)` so the variadic body still consumes its bytes.
- **`NativeFunctionToken.Decompile` falls back when `NativeItem` is null** — don't remove that guard; NTL drift produces null `NativeItem` constantly and the unconditional `NativeItem.Type` access cascades into NRE chains.

## Current opcode-mapping state

Three documents under `UELib/src/Branch/UE3/RL/` capture the state and methodology:

- **`snapshots/GNATIVES_SNAPSHOT_v868.md`** — full per-byte handler-address table for the current build. **Read this first when porting to a new RL version.** It lists every primary opcode 0x00..0x6F with its binary handler address, observed wire format, and current token mapping. The "Cross-version comparison procedure" section at the bottom describes how to recompute the byte→token map for a new build by matching handler addresses (which represent fixed semantics) rather than re-reverse-engineering each handler.
- **`RL_OPCODE_ANALYSIS.md`** — working note with session-by-session changelog, what was tried, what worked, decompile-side improvements, and remaining issues. Read this for context on *why* a mapping is what it is.
- **`snapshots/verified_handlers.md`** — historical per-byte verification trail (older format; the snapshot file supersedes it for cross-version use).

Read these before adding new token mappings.

## Opcode rotation across game versions

RL rotates its UnrealScript opcode permutation across patches — the same `EX_Let` semantics that lived at byte `0x4C` in v868 might live at `0x37` in v900. The token map in `EngineBranchRL.BuildTokenMap` is build-specific. When the user upgrades to a newer RL build:

1. **Dump the new GNatives table.** Find the new dispatcher base by searching for the `funcs_X[v3]` indexing pattern in `UStruct::SerializeExpr` (or grep for the "Unknown code token %02X" string and follow xrefs to the error handler — the error handler appears in many GNatives slots and anchors the table).
2. **Compare against the v868 snapshot** in `GNATIVES_SNAPSHOT_v868.md`. For each handler address from v868, find which byte in the new table points to that same handler (modulo ASLR). When a known handler appears at a new byte index, that byte rotated.
3. **Update `BuildTokenMap`** to the new bytes for the same handler→token mapping.
4. **Cross-check the parser function.** GNatives gives runtime semantics; the on-disk parser gives storage-side wire format (4-byte index reads, optional debug-info skips, JumpIfNot CodeOffset interpretation). For most rotated bytes the parser's structure follows GNatives, but verify byte-by-byte that the parser reads the same token-shape modulo expansion — a token whose `Deserialize` reads the wrong number of storage bytes will silently desync `ScriptPosition` and corrupt every subsequent token. See "Binary RE methodology" step 4 for what to watch for.
5. **Verify with the sentinel function set** (see "Testing workflow" above). If any baseline function regresses, the mapping is wrong somewhere.

The handler-address table in `GNATIVES_SNAPSHOT_v868.md` is the **stable** view — the byte values are not. Anchors (unique runtime fingerprint strings) listed at the bottom of the snapshot file are the most reliable way to identify a specific handler in a fresh dump.

## Binary RE methodology

When investigating a byte that the decompiler outputs garbage for:

1. **Disassemble the function** showing the broken output via `mcp__uelib__disassemble_function`. Identify the suspect token's `opcode_byte` value.
2. **Look up the handler.** `addr = 0x7FF6CF2AA580 + opcode_byte * 8` in IDA. Read the qword there to get the handler function address.
3. **Decompile the handler.** `mcp__ida-pro-mcp__decompile(addr=handler)` shows what it reads from the script stream:
   - `funcs_X[v]` calls = sub-expression dispatches (each = 1 byte sub-opcode + variable payload).
   - `*Code` / `++Code` / `Code += N` patterns = direct byte reads (counted into the wire format).
   - 8-byte qword reads = either UObject*, UProperty*, UClass*, FName, or a raw 8-byte literal.
   - Calls to `sub_7FF6CD317F00` (FFrame::ReadVariableSize) = UField* + 1 byte type.
   - Sub-table dispatchers (`funcs_Y[v]` where Y != GNatives) = secondary lookups for primitive cast / dynarray method / etc.
4. **Cross-check the parse-time wire format.** GNatives is the *runtime* dispatcher — it operates on the in-memory bytecode after the parser already applied 4→8 object/property/function index expansion, optional debug-info skips, and other on-disk decoration. For most opcodes the two agree, but **they diverge for any byte that touches storage representation**, and getting that wrong silently breaks parsing. Always confirm against the on-disk parser for:
   - **Object/property/function index reads** — 8-byte qword in GNatives = 4-byte index + 4-byte expansion in storage. The token's `Deserialize` must read 4 from the stream and call `AlignObjectSize()` (which advances `Position` by 8 to track in-memory size).
   - **`EX_DebugInfo` / optional padding / alignment reads** — these usually live in the parser path only.
   - **JumpIfNot / Case / Jump `CodeOffset`** — read by the parser as u16, interpreted by the renderer as in-memory `Position`. The cooker may undercount, which manifests as `if(...)` braces in wrong places (recovery lives in `JumpTokens.cs` — case A: CodeOffset inside JumpIfNot's own bytes, case B: CodeOffset mid-body-token).

   **Finding the on-disk parser** (`UStruct::SerializeExpr`): in v868 it's
   `sub_7FF6CD38C840` (renamed `UStruct__SerializeExpr` in the IDB). It's
   referenced from the UTF-16 string `L"Bad expr token %02x"` (default case)
   and `L"Bad array token %02x"` (inner switch for byte 0x19's dynarray sub-
   table). **Enable UTF-16 string detection in IDA before searching** —
   without it the string lookups return 0 hits and you'll wrongly conclude the
   parser was stripped from the binary.

   The byte permutations in `UStruct__SerializeExpr` ARE the v868 permutations
   (verified by cross-checking case 0x4C → Let, 0x65 → LocalVar, 0x29 →
   JumpIfNot, 0x3E → EndFunctionParms terminator, etc.). An earlier session
   committed a warning that `sub_7FF6CD38C840` had a wrong opcode permutation
   — that warning was wrong, and following it cost hours before the user
   intervened. **Do not re-introduce that warning.**

   **GNatives runtime vs UStruct::SerializeExpr parser CAN diverge for the
   same byte.** Case 0x2C is the proof: GNatives[0x2C] reads "1 sub + 1 byte
   + optional 0x20" (debug-mode instrumentation), while
   `UStruct::SerializeExpr` case 0x2C reads "1 sub + u16 + 1 sub + u16 + 1
   sub" (= EX_Conditional). The cooker emits the SerializeExpr-shape, and the
   package loader walks it as that shape, so for **decompilation the parser
   is authoritative**. Always cross-check both.
5. **Match against baseline EX_** — compare to stock UE3 `SerializeExpr` cases (or to other RL handlers with the same shape).
6. **Pick / write a token class** that matches the wire format exactly — including `AlignObjectSize` / `AlignSize(N)` calls so `ScriptPosition` stays in lock-step with the stream. Map the byte in `BuildTokenMap`.
7. **Test.** Decompile a function that contains the byte and check the output. If the output is broken, **don't tweak the rendering to make it look right** — re-verify both the GNatives handler AND the parser. The 0x21 lesson applies: tautological mapping causes cascading errors.

## Common commands

The CI workflow (`.github/workflows/build.yml`) installs .NET 9 SDK on Windows and runs:

```pwsh
dotnet restore
dotnet build "UE Explorer" --no-restore -c Release -f net48
```

Other useful invocations (run from the repo root):

```pwsh
# Build just the library (multi-targets — pick one with -f if needed)
dotnet build UELib/src/Eliot.UELib.csproj -c Debug -f net48

# Run the unit tests (net9.0)
dotnet test UELib/Test/Eliot.UELib.Test.csproj -c Debug

# Run a single test
dotnet test UELib/Test/Eliot.UELib.Test.csproj --filter "FullyQualifiedName~UnrealPackageTests.TestClassTypeOverride"

# Launch the GUI after a Debug build
& "UE Explorer\bin\Debug\net48\UEExplorer.exe"

# Run the MCP test suite
dotnet test UELib/MCP.Test/Eliot.UELib.MCP.Test.csproj -c Debug

# Publish the MCP server as a self-contained single-file Windows binary (~71 MB)
# The output exe gets registered in Codex's settings.json — see UELib/MCP/README.md
dotnet publish UELib/MCP/Eliot.UELib.MCP.csproj `
    -c Release -r win-x64 `
    -p:PublishSingleFile=true --self-contained true `
    -o UELib/MCP/publish
```

The `Setup` installer project requires Visual Studio with the "Microsoft Visual Studio Installer Projects" extension and is **not** built by `dotnet build` — skip it for everyday work.

The GUI persists user state (config, recent files, logs) under `%AppData%\EliotVU\UE Explorer`; delete this folder if settings get corrupted while testing.

## Architecture

### Loading flow

`UnrealLoader.LoadPackage(path)` → constructs `UPackageStream` and `UnrealPackage` → `UnrealPackage.Deserialize` reads the summary, auto-detects the build (or honors `BuildTarget`), instantiates the matching `EngineBranch`, sets up the serializer + token factory, then reads the name/import/export tables. `UnrealPackage.InitializePackage()` then materializes `UObject` instances. Decompiled UnrealScript is produced lazily by `UStruct.UByteCodeDecompiler` walking the `DeserializedTokens` list.

### Engine branches (the extension point for per-game behavior)

Every Unreal-derived game family that diverges from stock UE3 gets a class deriving from `UELib.Branch.EngineBranch` (typically `DefaultEngineBranch` for UE1–3 games). The branch owns:

- **`BuildTokenMap`** — maps opcode bytes (`0x00`..`0x6F`) to `Token` types. RL completely rewrites this table (see `EngineBranchRL.BuildTokenMap`); base UE3 opcodes are *not* a valid assumption inside RL packages with `LicenseeVersion >= 32`.
- **`SetupTokenFactory`** — picks the cutoff between extended-native and first-native opcodes. RL passes `0x70`/`0x70` so anything ≥ `0x70` is treated as a native function index.
- A `Decoder` (`IBufferDecoder`) for at-rest encryption (e.g., Huxley).
- A `Serializer` (`IPackageSerializer`) for header/object-table serialization quirks.

A branch is bound to a game by tagging the `UnrealPackage.GameBuild.BuildName` enum entry (in `UELib/src/UnrealPackage.cs`) with `[Build(...)]` (version range) and `[BuildEngineBranch(typeof(EngineBranchXxx))]`. RL is registered as `BuildName.RocketLeague` with `[Build(867, 868, 9u, 32u)]`. Other UE3 forks live as siblings under `UELib/src/Branch/UE3/` (APB, Borderlands `Willow`, DD2, GIGANTIC, HUXLEY, MOH, R6, RSS, SA2, SFX).

### Tokens (the bytecode → text translation layer)

Every UnrealScript opcode is a class deriving from `UStruct.UByteCodeDecompiler.Token`. A token has two responsibilities:

1. **`Deserialize(IUnrealStream)`** — read the token's payload from the script stream. After every raw stream read, call `Decompiler.AlignSize(N)` so `Decompiler.ScriptPosition` stays in lock-step with the stream — getting this wrong shifts every subsequent token's reported size and breaks the hex viewer.
2. **`Decompile()`** — emit the textual UnrealScript. Most tokens recurse into their operands via `DecompileNext()` / `NextToken<T>()`, which walks the flattened token list left-to-right. Skip a sub-token deliberately with `SkipCurrentToken()`; insert a trailing `;` with `Decompiler.MarkSemicolon()`.

Patterns to follow when adding RL tokens (`UELib/src/Branch/UE3/RL/Tokens/`):

- For an opcode in the **primary** opcode table, derive from `Token` (or a closer base like `JumpIfNotToken`, `ContextToken`, `FinalFunctionToken`) and register it in `EngineBranchRL.BuildTokenMap`.
- For an opcode under the **extended-native** prefix (`0x10` and `0x5E`/`0x71` in RL), register it in `ExtendedNativeFunctionToken.s_extendedNativeFunctionTokenMap` instead — that token reads the second opcode byte and dispatches. Anything not in that map falls through to a native call with index `opCode + 5000`.
- For a **specific named native** that needs a follow-up token (e.g. `AllControllers`), add the function name + token type to `FinalFunctionTokenRL.FunctionTokenMap`. The base token deserializes normally, then the mapped token is deserialized in-line and inserted into `DeserializedTokens`.
- For a **variadic native call** that takes an array as receiver plus a varargs tail, derive from `NativeFunctionToken`, deserialize the array via `DeserializeNext()`, skip any inline padding (commonly 2 bytes — remember the matching `AlignSize`), then call `base.Deserialize(stream)` for the variadic tail.

When stuck, the closest analogues live in `UELib/src/Core/Tokens/` (the stock UE token implementations) and the other UE3 branch directories.

## Conventions

- `.editorconfig` is authoritative: 4-space indent, CRLF for generated files, `dotnet_style_namespace_match_folder = true` (so a token in `UELib/src/Branch/UE3/RL/Tokens/` belongs in namespace `UELib.Branch.UE3.RL.Tokens`).
- `Eliot.UELib` enables `Nullable` and `EnforceCodeStyleInBuild` — null annotations matter, and analyzer warnings will surface in PR builds.
- The codebase relies heavily on `partial class UStruct { partial class UByteCodeDecompiler { ... } }` nesting; tokens reference siblings by their full nested name (e.g. `UStruct.UByteCodeDecompiler.JumpIfNotToken`).
- Game-conditional code uses `#if <SYMBOL>` (e.g. `#if ROCKETLEAGUE`, `#if BIOSHOCK`). The full symbol set lives in `Eliot.UELib.csproj`'s root `<DefineConstants>`.
- Native Tables (`*.NTL`) under `UE Explorer/Native Tables/` are loaded at runtime by the GUI; new ones must be added to `UEExplorer.csproj` with `CopyToOutputDirectory=PreserveNewest`.
