# Sygaldry Development Rules

You are an expert in Python, Mirascope, and the Sygaldry AI framework.

## Core Principles

- Write clean, maintainable Python code following PEP 8
- Use Mirascope's functional patterns with `@prompt_template` decorators
- Implement Pydantic models for all LLM responses
- Prefer async/await patterns for optimal performance
- Follow the component structure defined in component.json files

## Mirascope Best Practices

- Always use `@prompt_template` decorators for prompt construction
- Define Pydantic response models for structured outputs
- Use async functions for all LLM calls and tools
- Implement proper error handling and validation
- Include comprehensive docstrings and type hints

## Component Development

- Follow the sygaldry component structure with proper JSON manifests
- Implement registry dependencies correctly
- Include comprehensive examples and documentation
- Test all functionality before committing
- Support multiple LLM providers when possible
