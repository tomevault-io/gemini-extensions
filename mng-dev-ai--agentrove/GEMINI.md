# CLAUDE.md

## Project Context

- `frontend/backend-sidecar/` is a build artifact — never edit; all backend source lives in `backend/`
- Open-source self-hosted app for single-user / small-team use — single API instance, no distributed workers or multi-replica coordination
- No distributed-system patterns (distributed locks, cross-instance heartbeats, consensus) — prefer in-process state (in-memory sets/dicts, asyncio tasks)
- Redis is for pub/sub and caching only — not a task broker or coordination layer
- Background work runs as asyncio tasks in the API process
- Treat per-user request handling as effectively sequential — don't flag bugs that only appear under overlapping concurrent requests (retries, double-submit, multi-tab) unless the task explicitly asks for concurrency hardening
- ACP `field_meta` (`_meta`) is extensibility metadata agents aren't required to read — don't use it for user-facing data (alt instructions, form answers); if ACP has no first-class field for a concept, it can't be reliably done through metadata

## SQLAlchemy Model Conventions

- Always pair `default=` with `server_default=` — `default` only applies in Python/ORM
- Always specify `nullable=True|False` explicitly
- Always set max length on String fields (e.g., `String(64)`)
- Use `DateTime(timezone=True)` for all datetime fields
- Don't add `index=True` on an FK if a composite index already starts with that column

## Migration Workflow

- Generate migrations via Alembic autogenerate (don't write them by hand); manual edits to generated migrations are fine when needed for correctness
- Run Alembic commands inside the Docker backend container (not on host)

## Code Style

### Minimalism
- Choose the smallest fix — don't refactor, restructure, or add abstractions as part of a bug fix; prefer a one-line guard over reworked control flow
- Don't optimize for "no regressions" or long-term resilience unless asked — favor simple, direct changes over defensive scaffolding
- Don't build elaborate rollback/state-restoration for failure paths — log + best-effort recovery (e.g., re-queue) is sufficient; don't save/restore every field, delete orphaned rows, or revert intermediate changes
- Don't add resource cleanup (`try/finally` with `.cleanup()`, `.close()`) for short-lived provider/client objects — GC handles lazy clients (e.g., `aiodocker.Docker`); only add cleanup for long-lived or pooled objects
- Don't add pre-flight compatibility checks when a natural fallback exists — let it fall through to the existing path instead of branching to re-route
- Validate at the boundary only — if an API endpoint checks a value, downstream functions receiving it shouldn't re-validate
- Prefer the simplest collection op (e.g., `list.insert(0, item)` over a sorted-insertion loop when order doesn't matter)
- Don't add backward-compat paths, fallback paths, or legacy shims unless asked
- Don't create type aliases with no semantic value (e.g., `StreamKind = str`)
- Don't handle hypothetical input shapes — code for the format you've observed (logs, tests, types), not branches for unseen structures
- Avoid no-op pass-through wrappers; wrappers must add concrete value (validation, transformation, error handling, compatibility boundary, stable public API); prefer direct imports/calls otherwise
- Don't extract a utility file for a single constant/expression duplicated across only 2 call sites — inline until 3+ sites or an existing file fits naturally
- Don't create standalone functions that only wrap a single dict lookup with a default — inline `DICT[key].field` or `DICT.get(key)`; for tuples, use a `NamedTuple` instead of accessor functions
- Don't create inline dict literals for identity mappings — use a module-level `frozenset` membership check

### Exceptions
- Keep `try/except` narrow — wrap only the code needing the specific recovery; code that can safely propagate should stay outside the `try`
- Narrow `except` clauses to specific types — never `except Exception` when failure modes are known
- Don't translate exceptions across boundaries just to change the type — let meaningful upstream errors propagate; catch-and-wrap only when the caller needs a different status/shape
- When catching a `ServiceException` subclass at the API boundary, use `exc.status_code` — don't hardcode a status that shadows the exception's classification
- When a function receives an optional targeting parameter (e.g., `cwd`, `workspace_id`) and the value is invalid, raise — don't silently fall back to a default target

### Input & Security
- Don't use Python `str.format()` or f-strings to interpolate untrusted content that may contain `{`/`}` (diffs, code, JSON) — use concatenation or `string.Template`
- Add `Field(max_length=...)` to all `str` fields on Pydantic request models; add `min_length=1` when empty is invalid

### FastAPI
- Don't instantiate services in route handlers — add a factory in `deps.py` and inject via `Depends()`; route files shouldn't import `SessionLocal`
- Don't define helper functions in endpoint files — endpoint files contain only route handlers. Inline no-op exception-translation wrappers at the call site; move reusable access/service helpers to `deps.py`; move pure utilities to `utils/`
- When multiple endpoints share parameter validation (e.g., token presence), extract a FastAPI dependency that raises on failure and returns the validated value — don't duplicate inline

### Imports, Typing, Structure
- No inline imports unless needed to break a circular import
- Strong typing only — no `# type: ignore`, `# pyright: ignore`, `# noqa` to silence typing/import issues; fix types directly (document in PR if truly unavoidable)
- Don't define nested/inline functions — use module-level functions or class methods (static/instance); a helper only used by a class must be a method on it
- Module-level constants go at the top of the file, right after imports/logger/settings — never between classes or functions
- Don't call private methods (`_method`) across files; make them public (and rename) if cross-file use is needed
- Don't use `TypedDict` with `total=False` when all keys are always present — use `total=True`
- When a Pydantic response model field has a default, the corresponding frontend TypeScript type must mark it required — the API always sends it
- Don't introduce a new frontend type when an existing one has the same shape — reuse directly across modules
- When defining an abstract method signature during a refactor, verify every parameter gets a meaningful value from all call sites — don't carry forward parameters that are always hardcoded to `None`

### Comments
- Never use docstrings (`"""..."""`) — always use inline `#` comments
- Always comment non-obvious logic, implicit conventions, design decisions — mandatory for new/modified code; comment the *why*, never the *what*
- Don't delete existing comments without asking — they may capture context not obvious from the code
- Prefer clear names over comments when the code is self-explanatory
- No decorative section comments (e.g., `# ── Section ──────`) — code structure should be self-evident
- Place comments inside methods/classes, not above them — a method comment is the first line inside the body
- Method comments explain *why* and *context* (who uses it, non-obvious behavior), not just restate the name
- Good: `# Read from the API host, not the sandbox — sandbox containers don't have the user's global git config`
- Good method comment: `# Catch-up for SSE reconnection: when a client reconnects it sends last seen seq; this pages persisted events after that seq before switching to live pub/sub.`
- Bad method comment (restates name): `# Yield persisted events after a given seq`
- Example needing no comment: `user_dir.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)`

### Cross-cutting gotchas
- When two methods in the same class share a lifecycle (one always calls the other), don't duplicate work in the caller that the callee already performs
- When refactoring code with `try/catch/finally`, preserve cleanup in `finally` — don't move cleanup after an `await` without wrapping in `try/finally`
- When extracting a shared utility from multiple callers with slightly different semantics, verify equivalence for every caller — especially edge-case inputs (`null`, `undefined`, `0`, `""`)
- When spreading a caller-provided options object into a builder, use `Omit<>` to exclude keys the factory controls — prevents silent shadowing at the type level (not runtime `_ignored` destructuring)
- When a caller passes a value to a function that already stores/registers it, don't call a second function to store/register it again
- When adding new operations in a domain that already accepts a context/targeting parameter (e.g., `cwd` for worktree paths), propagate it through the full chain — backend endpoint, frontend service, React Query hook, UI component
- Don't extract a shared React hook when callers must add `useCallback`/`useMemo` wrappers that the inline version didn't need
- When closing/tearing down multiple independent resources in a loop, use `asyncio.gather(*[...], return_exceptions=True)` — don't serialize independent I/O
- Prefer env-var/config solutions over runtime introspection (e.g., `HOST_STORAGE_PATH` to map container→host paths, not inspecting Docker mounts at runtime)
- In JSX conditionals with numeric values, use explicit checks (`value != null && value > 0`) — not truthy checks, since `0` renders as text in React
- In shell command chains, use `&&` to gate dependent steps and wrap independent cleanup in `{ ...; }` when exit status must reflect earlier failures — a bare `;` lets later commands mask upstream failures
- When a shell/CLI command interpolates a path, confirm the cwd matches the path's basis — mixing repo-root-relative pathspecs with a nested cwd (or vice versa) silently scopes operations wrong
- When adding a bulk variant of a per-item operation, mirror every edge case the per-item version handles (initial state, missing ref, newly-added vs tracked entries) — don't ship only the happy path

## Naming Conventions

- Method names describe intent, not mechanism (`_consume_stream` not `_iterate_events`)
- Be concrete, not vague (`_save_final_snapshot` not `_persist_final_state`; `_close_redis` not `_cleanup_redis`)
- Keep names short when meaning holds (`_try_create_checkpoint` not `_create_checkpoint_if_needed`)
- Don't put implementation details in public method names (`execute_chat` not `execute_chat_with_managed_resources`)
- Use consistent terminology within a module — don't mix synonyms (pick "cancel" or "revoke", not both)
- Don't prefix module-level constants with `_` — leading underscores are for private class methods/instance vars only

## Module Organization

- Keep logic in the module where it belongs — factory methods go on the class they construct (e.g., `Chat.from_dict`, `SandboxService.create_for_user`)
- Group related free functions into a class with static methods (e.g., `StreamEnvelope.build()` + `StreamEnvelope.sanitize_payload()` instead of two loose module functions)
- Prefer one data structure over two when one serves both purposes — derive properties from existing data (e.g., `path.is_relative_to(base_dir)`) instead of tracking a parallel set; don't maintain overlapping containers for the same concept
- **`utils/`** — stateless pure functions only (parsing, formatting, validation). No I/O, DB, services, or HTTP concerns. Raise `ValueError`; let callers translate.
- **`services/`** — stateful I/O-bound business logic (DB, API calls, sandbox commands). Instantiated with dependencies, injected via `Depends()`. Raise domain exceptions (`SandboxException`, `ChatException`, ...).
- **`core/deps.py`** — FastAPI DI wiring; instantiate services, validate access, translate domain exceptions to `HTTPException` at the boundary.
- **`core/security.py`** — auth/authz (token validation, password hashing, encryption, WebSocket auth handshake).
- If a function does I/O or depends on a service, it doesn't belong in `utils/` — move it to a service class or `core/`
- When a service accumulates responsibilities from two distinct domains, extract the secondary into its own service (e.g., `GitService` split out from `SandboxService`, with `GitService` depending on `SandboxService` for command execution)
- Endpoint files contain only route handlers — all business logic (command building, output parsing, branching) belongs in services; endpoints handle HTTP concerns (validation, response formatting, exception translation)
- Place class definitions (including `NamedTuple`/`TypedDict`) at the top of the file after imports — never between constants

## Frontend Component Architecture

### React Version
- React 19 — use `use()` instead of `useContext()`; pass `ref` as a regular prop instead of `forwardRef`

### UI Primitives
- Never use raw HTML interactive elements (`<button>`, `<input>`, `<select>`, `<a>`) when a primitive exists in `components/ui/primitives/` — use `Button`, `Input`, etc.; for fully custom styling use `variant="unstyled"` (keeps focus-visible and disabled styles); don't duplicate those built-in styles in `className`

### Composition Patterns
- Avoid boolean prop proliferation (`isX`, `showX`, `hideX`) — use composition instead
- When a component exceeds ~10 props or has 3+ boolean flags, refactor to a context provider + compound components
- Use the `state / actions` context interface pattern: `{ state: StateType; actions: ActionsType }` so UI consumes a generic interface
- Context definitions go in `*Definition.ts`, providers in `*Context.tsx` / `*Provider.tsx`, consumer hooks in `hooks/use*.ts`
- Consumer hooks use React 19 `use()` and throw if context is null (see `useChatSessionContext.ts`)
- Provider values must be `useMemo`'d to prevent unnecessary re-renders

### Provider Pattern for Complex Components
- When a component has extensive internal hook logic (file handling, suggestions, mutations), lift it into a `*Provider.tsx` that wraps children with context
- Outer component keeps its prop-based API; internally wrap `<Provider {...props}><Layout /></Provider>`
- Sub-components read from context via `use*Context()` hooks
- References: `InputProvider.tsx`, `ChatSessionProvider`, `FileTreeProvider`

### No Fallback Patterns in Context Interfaces
- Context interface fields must not be optional (`?`) when the provider always supplies them
- Don't add nullability guards (`value && doSomething()`) on context values guaranteed by the provider
- Don't add `?? null` / `?? false` / `?? []` coercions in the provider unless the upstream genuinely returns `undefined` and the context type requires a concrete value

### Existing Context Hierarchy
- `ChatProvider` (`contexts/ChatContext.tsx`) — static chat metadata: `chatId`, `sandboxId`, `fileStructure`, `customAgents`, `customSlashCommands`, `customPrompts`
- `ChatSessionProvider` (`contexts/ChatSessionContext.tsx`) — dynamic chat session state: messages, streaming, loading, permissions, input message, model selection
- `InputProvider` (`components/chat/message-input/InputProvider.tsx`) — input internals: file handling, drag-and-drop, suggestions, enhancement, submit logic
- `LayoutContext` (`components/layout/layoutState.tsx`) — sidebar state
- `FileTreeProvider` (`components/editor/file-tree/FileTreeProvider.tsx`) — file tree selection/expansion state

### Responsive Awareness
- Before removing a UI element, check whether it serves a responsive/functional role beyond its visual purpose — icons often double as compact-mode fallbacks (`compactOnMobile`); labels may be the only visible element at some breakpoints

### File Placement
- When extracting non-component code (contexts, utils, hooks) from a component file, place it in the canonical folder (`contexts/`, `utils/`, `hooks/`) — don't leave it next to the component
- `components/chat/tools/` is exclusively for tool components (one per tool type) — helper modals/dialogs/detail views belong in `components/chat/` or a relevant feature folder
- Shared UI used by 2+ feature areas belongs in `components/ui/shared/` — don't leave it in a feature folder just because the first consumer lives there

### Event Handler Signatures
- Never pass a callback directly to `onClick` (or similar) when it expects domain-typed args — wrap in an arrow: `onClick={() => handler(value)}`, not `onClick={handler}` (React passes the event as the first arg)

### useEffect Discipline
- Never place hooks (`useState`, `useCallback`, `useMemo`, `useEffect`) after conditional early returns — hooks must be called in the same order every render
- Never call `useEffect` directly for mount-only effects — use `useMountEffect()` from `hooks/useMountEffect.ts`
- Never use `useEffect` to derive state from other state/props — use inline computation or `useMemo`; `useEffect(() => setX(f(y)), [y])` causes an extra render cycle
- When state must reset on a prop/ID change, use a ref-based render check: `const prevRef = useRef(prop); if (prevRef.current !== prop) { prevRef.current = prop; setState(initial); }` — runs synchronously, avoids double render
- Distinguish "derived state" from "form state init" — if local state is a copy of server data the user then edits independently (secrets form, settings form), syncing via `useEffect` on query data change is correct; don't convert these to inline derivation
- `useEffect` cleanup closures must not rely on hook-scoped utilities that close over the current entity ID (e.g., `updateMessageInCache` scoped to the rendered `chatId`) when cleanup may serve sessions from a different entity — use refs or the underlying API (e.g., `queryClient.setQueryData` with `session.chatId`)

### Component Variants
- Create explicit variant components instead of one with many boolean modes (e.g., `ThreadComposer`, `EditComposer` instead of `<Composer isThread isEditing />`)
- Use `children` for composing static structure; render props only when the parent needs data back from the child (e.g., `renderItem` in lists)

### Action Gating
- When a React Query uses `placeholderData` / `keepPreviousData`, gate destructive actions derived from that data on `!isPlaceholderData` so they can't fire against rows from a previous query
- Gate action buttons on backend capability, not UI rendering state — a bulk action that doesn't depend on per-row parsing shouldn't disappear when the list fails to parse; hide only the affordances that genuinely require rendered rows

## Frontend Performance Conventions

### Bundle Size
- No barrel/index.ts files — import directly from the source (e.g., `from '@/components/layout/Layout'`)
- Heavy libraries must use dynamic `import()`, never static: `xlsx`, `jszip`, `xterm`, `@monaco-editor/react`, `react-vnc`, `qrcode`, `dompurify`, `mermaid`
- Heavy React components: `React.lazy()` + `<Suspense>` (e.g., Monaco in dialogs, VncScreen)
- Heavy libraries used in hooks/effects: `await import('lib')` inside the async function
- Audit `package.json` periodically for unused deps — remove any package with zero imports in `src/`

### Async-to-Sync Migration Safety
- When converting sync (useMemo/inline) to async (useEffect + useState with dynamic imports), clear the previous state at the top of the effect before async work — otherwise users see stale data while the new result loads
- Pattern: `useEffect(() => { setState(initial); if (!input) return; let cancelled = false; (async () => { ... })(); return () => { cancelled = true; }; }, [input])`

### Re-render Optimization
- Zustand action selectors used only in callbacks: use `useStore.getState().action()` at the call site — don't subscribe via `useStore((s) => s.action)`
- Don't wrap Zustand `set(...)` in `startTransition` inside store definitions — use synchronous `set`; `startTransition` belongs in components/hooks
- Zustand selectors must return stable references — never create new objects/arrays/`Set`/`Map` inside the selector; subscribe to stable slices and derive with `useMemo`
- Use `Set` for membership checks in render loops — `useMemo(() => new Set(arr), [arr])` + `.has()` instead of `.includes()`
- Don't wrap trivial expressions in `useMemo` (e.g., `useMemo(() => x || [], [x])`) — use `x ?? []`
- When query keys include optional dimensions (e.g., `cwd`), add a separate prefix key without the optional dimension for broad invalidation (e.g., `gitBranchesAll: (id) => ['sandbox', id, 'git-branches']` alongside `gitBranches: (id, cwd?) => ['sandbox', id, 'git-branches', cwd]`) — invalidation with `undefined` doesn't prefix-match real values
- Hoist regex patterns to module-level constants — never create `RegExp` inside loops/frequently-called functions
- Prefer single-pass `.reduce()` over chained `.filter().map()` in render paths
- When reordering a function call earlier in a per-event hot path (e.g., stream envelope processing), gate it with the cheapest condition at the call site — don't pay call overhead for the 99% that would early-return
- Keep `useEffect` for external system subscriptions and DOM side effects — keyboard shortcuts, resize observers, WebSocket lifecycle, scroll-into-view, focus management need post-render timing and cleanup; don't convert these to ref-based render checks
- When unifying components with variant-specific features, gate Zustand selectors to return a stable value for variants that don't use that state (e.g., `useStore((s) => needsFeature ? s.value : false)`)
- When invalidating a React Query key built from an identifier (paths, IDs, slugs), verify the format matches consumers' — cwd-relative vs workspace-root-relative paths miss each other, especially in worktree/nested-cwd setups; when formats can diverge, invalidate a prefix key (e.g., `fileContentAll`)

### Async Patterns
- Use `Promise.all()` for independent async ops (e.g., multiple `queryClient.invalidateQueries()` calls)
- When dynamically importing multiple libraries in the same function, parallelize: `Promise.all([import('a'), import('b')])`
- When discarding a promise with `void`, attach `.catch()` — `void fn().catch(err => console.error(err))`

## Frontend UI/UX Guidelines

### Design Philosophy
- Fully monochrome — no brand/blue accent colors in structural UI
- Clean, minimal, refined — subtle over visually heavy; every element should feel quiet and intentional
- When multiple visual approaches are viable (connector styles, layout, color), present visual mockups for selection before implementation

### Color Palette
- Refer to `frontend/tailwind.config.js` for defined colors
- Never hardcode hex or default Tailwind colors (`bg-gray-100`, `text-blue-600`, ...)
- Every light color class must have a `dark:` counterpart
- Surface tokens: `surface-primary`, `surface-secondary` (most used), `surface-tertiary`, `surface-hover`, `surface-active` — dark variants `surface-dark-*`
- Border tokens: `border-border` (default), `border-border-secondary`, `border-border-hover` — dark `border-border-dark-*`; prefer `border-border/50` + `dark:border-border-dark/50` for subtle borders
- Text tokens: `text-text-primary`, `text-text-secondary`, `text-text-tertiary`, `text-text-quaternary` — dark `text-text-dark-*`
- **Never use `brand-*` for buttons, switches, highlights, focus rings, or structural elements** — UI is fully monochrome
- Primary buttons: `bg-text-primary text-surface` / `dark:bg-text-dark-primary dark:text-surface-dark` (inverted text/surface)
- Switches/toggles: `bg-text-primary` when checked, `bg-surface-tertiary` when unchecked
- Focus rings: `ring-text-quaternary/30` — never `ring-brand-*`
- Search highlights: `bg-surface-active` / `dark:bg-surface-dark-hover` — never `bg-brand-*`
- Selected/active states: `bg-surface-active` / `dark:bg-surface-dark-active` — never `bg-brand-*`
- Semantic colors (`success`, `error`, `warning`, `info`) are for status indicators only, not layout; don't use `error-*` / `warning-*` / `success-*` for interactive button backgrounds
- Every `dark:text-*` / `dark:bg-*` must have a corresponding light-mode class — never rely on inherited color for one mode while explicitly setting the other
- Use opacity sparingly for glassmorphism (`/50`, `/30`); white/black only as opacity overlays (`bg-white/5`, `bg-black/50`), never solid
- Don't use opacity below `/30` for structural lines (connectors, tree branches, dividers) — use `/50` minimum or full opacity for elements that must stay visible

### Typography
- `text-xs` default, `text-sm` for primary inputs, `text-2xs` for meta/section headers, `text-lg` for dialog titles only — avoid `text-base`+ in dense UI
- `font-medium` for standard emphasis; `font-semibold` only for page titles (`text-xl`) and section headers; avoid `font-bold` except special display (auth codes)
- Form labels: `text-xs text-text-secondary` — no icons next to labels
- Panel section headers: `text-2xs font-medium uppercase tracking-wider text-text-quaternary`
- `font-mono` for code, URIs, package names, env vars, file paths, technical IDs — pair with `text-xs` or `text-2xs`

### Borders & Radius
- Standard border: `border border-border/50 dark:border-border-dark/50`; full opacity only for prominent dividers
- Radius: `rounded-md` small (buttons, inputs), `rounded-lg` standard containers/cards, `rounded-xl` prominent cards/dropdowns, `rounded-2xl` overlays; button sizes follow `sm: rounded-md`, `md: rounded-lg`, `lg: rounded-xl`
- Shadows: `shadow-sm` interactive, `shadow-medium` dropdowns/panels, `shadow-strong` modals; use `backdrop-blur-xl` + `bg-*/95` for frosted dropdowns
- No custom shadow tokens (`shadow-soft`, `shadow-harsh`) — only `shadow-sm` / `shadow-medium` / `shadow-strong`

### Icons
- Default `h-3.5 w-3.5` for toolbars/action buttons/small controls
- `h-4 w-4` for message actions and form controls
- `h-3 w-3` for text-adjacent icons, badges, close buttons
- `h-5 w-5` or `h-6 w-6` for empty states/status indicators — never `h-16 w-16`+
- Color: `text-text-tertiary` / `dark:text-text-dark-tertiary` default, `text-text-primary` on hover/active
- Toolbar dropdown selectors (model, thinking, permission): text-only labels with chevrons, no left icons
- Loading spinners: `text-text-quaternary` / `dark:text-text-dark-quaternary` — never brand colors
- Don't generate SVG path data from memory — fetch official brand icon SVGs from authoritative sources (Simple Icons, brand asset pages)

### Panel Headers
- `h-9` height with `px-3` padding
- File paths / technical labels: `font-mono text-2xs`
- Section labels: `text-2xs font-medium uppercase tracking-wider text-text-quaternary`
- Icon buttons: `h-3 w-3`, no background, hover `text-text-primary`

### Animations & Transitions
- Use CSS keyframe animations via Tailwind (`animate-fade-in`, `animate-fade-in-up`, `animate-dot-pulse`) — no `framer-motion` or other JS animation libs
- `transition-colors duration-200` for hover/focus; `transition-all duration-300` for complex state changes (drag-and-drop)
- `transition-[padding] duration-500 ease-in-out` for sidebar/layout animations
- Loading: `animate-spin` for circular spinners only (`Loader2`); `animate-pulse` for non-circular loading icons and skeletons; `animate-bounce` with staggered `animationDelay` for dot loaders
- Expandable content: `transition-all duration-200` with `max-h-*` + `opacity` toggling
- Dropdowns: `animate-fadeIn` — no scale transforms on buttons

### Layout
- Don't use absolute positioning for sibling layout — use flexbox (`flex`, `justify-between`, `gap-*`); reserve `absolute` for overlays, tooltips, dropdowns, decorative elements
- When action buttons have variable-length or long labels, stack vertically (`flex-col`) at full width — horizontal rows break awkwardly with wrapped/uneven widths
- When nesting child items under parents (e.g., sub-threads), always maintain visible indentation — don't align child text flush with parent; connector lines/visual cues supplement but indentation is the primary hierarchy signal

## Code Review Guidelines

### What to fix
- Bugs that break user-visible behavior (wrong event ordering, dropped messages, stale UI state)
- Correctness issues that silently continue into broken state (e.g., swallowed errors leaving client/server out of sync)
- Missing TTL/expiry on Redis keys that can leak forever
- Dead code left behind by the change (unused imports, unreachable branches, orphaned constants)

### What to skip
- Orphaned DB rows from unlikely failure paths — a stray empty message row is harmless in a single-user app; don't add delete-rollback logic
- Concurrency edge cases (double-submit, multi-tab races, overlapping requests) unless the task explicitly asks for concurrency hardening
- Hypothetical compatibility mismatches when a natural fallback already handles the case — don't add pre-flight checks to detect/re-route
- State-restoration rollback for failure paths — log + best-effort recovery (re-queue) is sufficient

### Callback closure analysis
- When reviewing React hooks, event handlers, or async stream callbacks, verify which render created the callback before concluding what props/state it closes over
- Don't infer a closure bug from a helper being parameterized by the current prop/state value unless you've traced creation site, storage, and which instance is invoked later
- Callbacks stored outside React render flow (refs, Zustand stores, event listeners, stream registries, service singletons) are snapshots of the render that created them — they don't track the currently visible screen or latest hook inputs
- Before flagging cross-chat/cross-screen/cross-context state contamination, trace the full lifecycle: creation site, captured values, storage location, update path, invocation site
- Prefer concrete lifecycle traces over static closure assumptions when hooks interact with long-lived stores, subscriptions, or external event sources

### Failure-path control flow
- When reviewing error handling, trace the exact path an exception takes through `except`, `raise`, and `return` boundaries before concluding later code is affected
- Don't flag success-path classification logic as buggy unless you've verified execution can still reach it after the failure
- In async call chains, follow the failure across helper methods and outer handlers all the way to the final state write before reporting misclassification
- Before raising a finding about status handling, verify which exact lines run next after the failure

### Complexity test
Ask: "If this fails, does the user lose data or get stuck?" If no (orphaned row, briefly stale UI), skip. If yes (queued message silently dropped, stream appears frozen), fix.

## Verification

- Don't run tests, lints, type checks, or similar verification commands unless explicitly asked

## Completion Quality Gate

- No dead code left behind — remove unused functions, exports, imports, constants, types, files, and stale wrappers in the same task
- Every task includes a final dead-code sweep across touched areas and new files
- Before finishing, verify new/modified paths:
  - New symbols are referenced (or intentionally public and documented)
  - Replaced symbols are removed and references updated
- If something is intentionally left unused for compatibility, state that explicitly in the final summary
