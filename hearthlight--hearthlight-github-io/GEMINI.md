# Hearthlight — working notes for Claude

A cozy 2.5D pixel-art life game (solo story mode whose valley opens onto the wild lands + a
local **Party Mode** for 1–8 players with phones as controllers; a phone can drive the solo game
too). Plain ES modules, **no build step**, Three.js 0.170 from the
jsDelivr CDN (import map in `index.html`). Everything is procedural: every texture, model and
sound is made in code — never add image or audio files.

The user writes in French or English, expects a very high bar (score each area /10, iterate
to 9+), judges from in-game screenshots, and wants finished work committed & pushed to
`origin/main` (message ending with the `Co-Authored-By` line).

## Run & test

```bash
python3 tools/devserver.py 8765        # static files + /__shot + /__lan + /ws party relay
```

- Game: <http://localhost:8765/?debug=1> · phone controller: `/pad.html#CODE`.
- `window.game.debug`: `step(n, dt)`, `shot(name, scale, crop)` (PNG in `screenshots/`,
  git-ignored), `newGame`, `tp(x, z)`, `hour(h)`, `pause(on)`.
- `const T = await import('/tools/partybots.js')`: `boot(n)` (title → party lobby with n bot
  phones), `mode('explore'|'waves'|'brawl'|'story')`, `vote(re)`, `fight(frames)`,
  `warp(x, z)`, `clearWave()`, `skipTalk()`, `autoplay('lobby')`. Bots talk to the real relay.
- `window.__errs` (filled by `T.boot`) and the console must stay at **0 errors**.
- Translations: `node tools/i18n-scan.mjs` must report **0 missing** in every language (fr, es,
  de, it — and each one's party lines; `--list` prints them, `--lang=de` one language);
  `node tools/i18n-check.mjs es` compares a language's files with their French twins. Screens in a
  language: `tools/langshots.js` (`start('de')`). Syntax check: `node --check file.js`.
- Remote play (`play.html#CODE.key`, a friend at home) needs the Node relay — the Python dev
  server has none: `node server/relay.mjs --static . --lan --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8792` (once
  `npm --prefix server ci`). Each remote player gets their own camera (`p.rcam`, drawn by
  `Party.drawRemote` into `remote-host.js`'s canvases); the big screen frames the others.
- Test Party Mode with 1, 4 and 8 bots; check the solo game still works and the whole story
  in `T.autoplay()` (the first bot wears the crown and starts the party: `{t:'start'}`).
- Solo quick start: `D.pause(true); await D.newGame('Alex'); await D.skip(200);
  game.state.flags.wildIntro = true; game.world.wild.chooseClass('mage'); D.tp(-43, 86)`
  (a steppe camp; `game.world.wild` is the `Wild`, `.combat`, `.encounters`, `.travel`…).
- A phone in solo: `game.phone.start()`, then open `/pad.html#CODE` in another tab; the pad
  records drawing errors in `pad.S.drawError` (its loop never stops on one).
- Gamepads (the pane has none): `const F = await import('/tools/fakepad.js'); F.install(2,
  ['xbox', 'ps'])` fakes `navigator.getGamepads()` (families xbox / ps / nintendo);
  `F.press(i, 'a')`, `F.set(i, 'select', true)`, `F.stick(i, x, y)`; rumbles land in
  `window.__rumble`. `tools/padparty.js` `start(bots, shots)` plays Party Mode with pads (join,
  their big-screen menu, a queue, a late pad, rumble): poll `window.__pp`.
- Trailer (English, for Reddit): `tools/trailer.js` scripts the Party Mode shots, `tools/reel.js`
  records them frame by frame at 1080p (`POST /__rec` → ffmpeg, lossless mkv in
  `screenshots/reel/`) with captions in the pixel font, a real `pad.html` phone and the game's own
  sounds re-rendered offline; `tools/reelcut.py` cuts them after `tools/trailer.edl.json`. The
  recipe is in `trailer.js`'s header (`TR.all()` ≈ 10 min, `TR.mix()`, then `reelcut.py cut`).

### Known pitfalls

- **Never name a variable or parameter `t`** in a function that calls `t()` (the i18n
  function). It has broken things before.
- In tests, wait until `game.world.overCol` exists before `T.boot()`.
- Don't `await` a party fade (`fadeTo`, `backToLobby`) without stepping `game.debug.step`.
- Bots need a real `setTimeout` delay between steps so the relay delivers their messages.
- When the browser pane is hidden, `requestAnimationFrame` is paused: drive frames with
  `game.debug.step`, and capture the phone with `window.pad.draw()`.
- The big world's ground is painted in workers: inside a tight `game.debug.step` loop their
  messages never arrive — yield real time (`await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, 100))`)
  before screenshots of new places.
- Navigating a tab to the same `pad.html#CODE` URL doesn't reload it (hash change only): use
  `location.reload()` to pick up new code.
- Editing with scripts: replace exact strings and check they occur once — never cut a slice
  between two markers (it silently deleted half of party.js once).
- `javascript_tool` times out after 45 s: split long scripts or run them in the background
  and poll a result variable.
- After a test with a real pad tab, that phone can come back into later `T.boot()` parties
  (even with its tab closed) and wear the crown, so `T.autoplay()` never starts: remove it
  (`P.removePlayer`) or crown a bot (`P.host.give(P.players.find((p) => p.id === 'bot0'))`).
- A Bash hook blocks heredocs containing the bare word "helm".
- The i18n scanner reads a straight apostrophe in a `//` comment after code as the start of a
  string (hundreds of false « missing »): write comments with `’`.
- Saga cast ids (`src/saga/cast.js`) must be unique across the whole saga — a second `nell:`
  silently replaces the first (chapter 3's Nugget Nell became chapter 8's singer once). Check:
  `grep -n "^  [a-z0-9]*: {" src/saga/cast.js | awk -F: '{print $2}' | sort | uniq -d`.
- A zone no chapter ever opens stays under the Murk (the Wide Sea `wide` opens with chapter 7);
  a new chapter's `zones` are opened (and the Murk refreshed) by `beginChapter`.
- A chapter prop's `userData.anim(t, saga)` gets the saga as its 2nd argument, not a frame time:
  a model whose anim needs `dt` keeps its own (ch10's `mooredShip`). A dungeon room counts
  heroes only a tile inside its edges: keep goal lines (`goalZ`) at `z + 1` or more.
- A `switch` with the same `case` twice runs only the first: a treasure hat called `furhat`
  hid behind the steppe folk's felt hat (it's `chapka` now). New hats, foes, props: grep the id.
- Props, buildings and valley animals merge their still parts into one mesh per material
  (`bakeMeshes` / `bakeTree` in `models/geom.js`): a part you animate, recolour or look up later
  must carry `userData.keep` (or `flag` / `swing`), or it vanishes into the merged mesh.
- README shots: `resize_window` 960×540, English (`game.settings.lang = 'en'` + `setLang('en')`),
  then `sagarun`/`worldboss` marks with `clean: 1` (the line typed out, old toasts cleared).
  Party shots come out 1280×720, solo 960×540. Reset the viewport (`preset: 'desktop'`) after.
- The valley is dense with trees and full of story places: big new constructions go in
  the big world instead (the Festival Ring now stands on the Golden Steppe, west of the
  valley: `ARENA_SITE` in `src/world/big/layout.js`, footprint cleared in `gen.js`, floor
  painted as `TT.ARENA` by `paint.js`, buildings in `src/party/arena3d.js`).

## Conventions

- **Style**: crisp pixels (integer scales only), toon shading (`toon()` in `render/r3d.js`),
  depth outlines, soft palette, the game's pixel font (`engine/font.js`), paper panels
  (`ui/ui.js`), synthesised sounds & music (`engine/audio.js`, data-driven tracks).
- **Controls**: never write a key into a hint ("E", "Esc", "Tab"): `ctl('interact')` (ui.js)
  names it on the device in hand — a key cap, a gamepad's button by family (Xbox A B X Y,
  PlayStation ✕ ○ □ △, Nintendo B A Y X), the phone's; `device()` says which ('keys' · 'pad' ·
  'phone' · 'touch'); `keyHint` draws a gamepad's face buttons round. In Party Mode a player's
  own buttons: `P.keyOf(p, 'a'|'b'|'x'|'y'|'u'|'m')`; a text for everyone says `{a}` with
  `P.keyName('a')` (the connected players' own: « A/E » when they differ), never a bare "A" —
  a keyboard player is there too, with the big screen's mouse (their menu, the votes: `tvmenu.js`
  `pointing()`, `voteRects`). `input.buzz(pattern, index)` rumbles.
- **Text**: every visible string goes through `t('English text', vars)` (or `tn` for plurals);
  the English text is the key. Five languages: French in `src/lang/fr/*.js` (new content → a new
  file, registered in `src/lang/fr/index.js`), following `tools/i18n-glossary.md`: tutoiement,
  French typography (space before `! ? : ;`, `« »`, `’`, `…`); Spanish, German, Italian in
  `src/lang/{es,de,it}/` — the same files as French (same keys, `_FR` exports → `_ES/_DE/_IT`,
  `index.js` from `node tools/i18n/mkindex.mjs xx`), each with its guide
  (`tools/i18n-glossary-{es,de,it}.md`), its names (`tools/i18n/names-xx.json`) and a translator's
  brief (`tools/i18n/brief-xx.md`). A new string → all four languages. Lines said to the whole
  party go in a chapter file's `__group` (vous · ustedes · ihr · voi). Dictionaries load on demand
  (`loadLang`). The dialogue box translates `say()` texts itself — don't double-translate.
- **Solo & Party share their systems**: the solo game runs Party Mode's systems (zones, swim,
  vehicles, mounts, combat, camps, lairs, progress, travel, secrets, races, events, the Festival
  Ring) through `src/solo/wild.js`, a "party of one" implementing the party API they use
  (`players`, `act`, `host`, `net`, `ask`, `say`, `spawnNpc`, `loadSave`/`writeSave` → the solo
  save, `keyName`…). A change to one of them must keep working in both modes: test both.
  Party-only wording goes through `P.solo ? … : …`.
- Match the surrounding code: dense, lightly commented, small helpers, no framework.

## The big world (v3, grown in World v7)

`src/world/big/` — a 1728×512 world streamed in 32×32-tile chunks around the camera views:
two continents on one plane — the Hearthlands (`C1`, `gen.js`, around the valley, which keeps
its own coordinates) and the Dawnlands (`C2`, `gen2.js`) across the Wide Sea. Ground painted
in workers (`paint.js`, identical pixels to `art/terrain.js` in the valley), `BigCollision`
replaces `world.overCol` while it runs (`world.big` is set), `WorldMap` = minimap/fog (maps fit
the continent you're on: `mapRegion`). **Relief**: every tile has a height (`map.elev`); faces
are painted under drops (`faceTex`), a one-level step of `SLOPE` ground is a walkable bank,
bigger drops/rock are cliffs (`map.block`), paths are stairs, rivers fall where the ground
steps; mountains = `mountain()` terraces + a `CRAG` core + 3D `peak` POIs. Render the layout
with `node tools/bigmap.mjs screenshots/bigmap.png`. New tile types live in `world/tiles.js`
(`HIGH` plateaus get cliff faces, `LIQUID` get the animated overlay). Rooms are built off-map
at x ≥ 2000, dungeons at x ≥ 3000.

## Plans & progress logs (read the latest first after a context reset)

- Parks v10 « Hearthlight Parks » (P0 done: the atlas; nothing built yet) — walk the 63 US
  national parks in the game's style, each map faithful to the park's official visitor map;
  solo, Party, or a shared open world where everyone online sees each other (a cute MMO, the
  default: `server/world.mjs` to come); speech bubbles & quick phrases from the phone, the
  keyboard or a gamepad: `docs/plans/parks-v10.md`, the atlas `docs/parks/README.md` (a dossier
  per park, `parks.json`, `SOURCES.md`). **Unreleased**: nothing of it in any playable version
  (Pages, desktop, the VPS copy, demos) until the user says so — a local-only dev flag, `src/parks/`
  left out of the Pages & desktop copies, no world server deployed (the plan's §0). And, always:
  check that everything pushed to this public repo is safe (no secrets, private infra details,
  personal data or local paths, copied text or images).

- Release v9 (in progress) — finish the game & prepare its release (pause menu, HUD modes, the
  hero in the creator, the big-screen menu, eight classes, World v7's leftovers, ES/DE/IT, the
  relay, the VPS, Electron, Pages — nothing published): `docs/plans/release-v9.md` (its log).

- Party Mode v3 (done): `docs/plans/party-v3.md` · `docs/plans/party-v3-progress.md`.
- Controls v8 (done) — the keyboard, a gamepad or a phone, in solo and Party (a pad player's
  own menu on the big screen): `docs/plans/controls-v8.md`.
- Solo v2 — the wild lands, the hero & the phone in the solo game: `docs/plans/solo-v2.md` ·
  `docs/plans/solo-v2-progress.md`.
- Adventure v5 (done) — Dino Isle (a jungle island of dinosaurs in the south-east sea: zone
  `dino`), dinosaurs to meet, tame and free (`src/party/dinos.js`, `src/models/dinos3d.js`,
  `src/combat/v5/`), the Tyrant King, new gloom (jellyfish blooms, night bats, mimics),
  companions managed from the phone (`src/party/buddies.js`, profile `pets`):
  `docs/plans/dino-v5.md` · `docs/plans/dino-v5-progress.md`.
- World v7 « Le Grand Monde » (in progress) — a WoW-vanilla-sized world (two continents with
  relief, lands after great national parks), the whole main story rewritten (the Duchess &
  the Murk, ten chapters), dungeons & bosses, cutscenes, levels to 40, side quests: brief
