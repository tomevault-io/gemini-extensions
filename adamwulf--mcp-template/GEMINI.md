# Project Goals: MCP Template
This project aims to create a simple command line executable and Swift package to make creating MCPs (Model Control Protocol) for Mac very easy. The project will eventually support:
1. Command line stdio for direct MCP interaction
2. Command line stdio → standalone Mac app via Bonjour for networked MCP communication
3. SSE server in a Package → example command line app for SSE-based MCP

### MCPExample Targets:

The MCPExample targets demonstrate:
  1. How to use EasyMCP and EasyMacMCP to build a functional MCP server (via mcp-helper)
  2. How to use a running Mac app (MCPExample) as the "brains" that can connect to multiple MCP servers
  3. How to establish bidirectional communication between a GUI app and multiple command-line MCP servers

1. MCPExample (macOS App)
   - Purpose: macOS SwiftUI application that demonstrates MCP integration with multiple helpers
   - Dependencies: EasyMacMCP
   - Key Files:
     - MCPExample/MCPExample/MCPExampleApp.swift - Main app entry point
     - MCPExample/MCPExample/MCPMacApp.swift - Main implementation with handling of MCP server connections
     - MCPExample/MCPExample/ContentView.swift - SwiftUI interface with controls to test pipe communication and display messages
     - MCPExample/MCPExample/BuildSettings.swift - Shared build configuration including app group identifier for shared container access
     - MCPExample/MCPExample/HostRequestPipe.swift - Actor for reading requests from MCP helpers 
     - MCPExample/MCPExample/HostResponsePipe.swift - Actor for sending responses to specific MCP helpers

2. mcp-helper (Command Line Tool)
   - Purpose: Background helper process that runs the actual MCP server (can be launched multiple times)
   - Dependencies: EasyMacMCP, ArgumentParser
   - Key Files:
     - MCPExample/mcp-helper/MCPHelper.swift - Command line implementation that initializes MCP server with a unique helper ID
     - MCPExample/mcp-helper/BuildSettings.swift - Shared build configuration with constants for app group identifier and bundle IDs

3. Shared Folder (Common Code)
   - Purpose: Contains code shared between MCPExample and mcp-helper
   - Located at: MCPExample/Shared/
   - Key Files:
     - PipeConstants.swift - Defines paths for the central request pipe and helper-specific response pipes
     - MCPRequest.swift - Defines tool request types with CaseIterable conformance, toolMetadata, and create method
     - MCPResponse.swift - Defines response types with asResult method for converting to MCP result format

### Dependencies:
- swift-argument-parser (1.3.0+) - Used for CLI argument handling
- swift-log - Logging framework for structured logging
- mcp-swift-sdk (main branch) - Core MCP implementation from modelcontextprotocol/swift-sdk

### Current Implementation Status:
- Package structure fully implemented with EasyMCP and EasyMacMCP targets
- Pipe communication architecture updated to support multiple concurrent MCP servers
- EasyMacMCP uses a protocol-based architecture with self-describing request and response types
- MCPRequestProtocol has toolMetadata and create method to build from CallTool.Parameters
- MCPResponseProtocol has asResult method to convert to CallTool.Result
- Communication follows hub-and-spoke model with central request pipe and helper-specific response pipes
- Proper async/await implementation throughout the codebase

## Communication Mechanism
- MCPExample and mcp-helper communicate via named pipes (FIFOs) in a shared app group container
- The communication follows a hub-and-spoke pattern:
  - One centralized pipe for all MCP servers to write to the Mac app (many-to-one) via HelperRequestPipe/HostRequestPipe
  - Individual dedicated pipes for the Mac app to respond to each specific MCP server (one-to-many) via HostResponsePipe/HelperResponsePipe
- Flow:
  1. Each MCP server instance launches with a unique helperId
  2. The server sends an initialize() request via the central request pipe to the Mac app
  3. Mac app receives this request and recognizes the new server by its helperId
  4. Mac app creates and writes to a dedicated response pipe named with the helperId
  5. Each MCP server reads from its own dedicated response pipe, avoiding contention
- This architecture enables the Mac app to communicate with multiple MCP server instances simultaneously
- Protocol-based type-safe MCP communication:
  1. Request types conform to MCPRequestProtocol and describe their own tools via toolMetadata
  2. Request types have a create method to convert MCP.CallTool.Parameters to specific request types
  3. Response types conform to MCPResponseProtocol and provide conversion to MCP.CallTool.Result
  4. EasyMacMCP automatically discovers and registers tools from request types
  5. No explicit tool registration needed - just define the request and response enum cases
