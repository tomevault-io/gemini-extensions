# DX9 FFP Proxy — Game Porting Guide

You are helping a user port a DX9 shader-based game to the fixed-function pipeline. Each game folder under `patches/<GameName>/` is a self-contained remix-comp-proxy project (copied from the template at `rtx_remix_tools/dx/remix-comp-proxy/`). The goal is RTX Remix compatibility: Remix requires FFP geometry to inject path-traced lighting and replaceable assets. Also use the Vibe RE tools (retools, livetools) for static and dynamic analysis to assist with developing this wrapper. They are meant to be used together.

**SKINNING IS OFF BY DEFAULT.** Do NOT enable skinning, modify skinning code, or discuss skinning infrastructure unless the user explicitly asks for character model / bone / skeletal animation support. Until then, treat skinning as non-existent. When the user does request it, read `src/comp/modules/skinning.hpp` and `src/comp/modules/skinning.cpp` for the full implementation.

**SKINNING APPROACH: FFP indexed vertex blending, NOT CPU matrix math.** When skinning is enabled, keep BLENDINDICES and BLENDWEIGHT in the vertex declaration and buffer, upload bone matrices via `SetTransform(D3DTS_WORLDMATRIX(n), &boneMatrix[n])`, enable `D3DRS_INDEXEDVERTEXBLENDENABLE = TRUE`, and set `D3DRS_VERTEXBLEND` to the weight count. CPU-side vertex skinning is a **last resort** -- it is extremely expensive and tanks frame rate. Always prefer the hardware path.

## What remix-comp-proxy Does

Each game's remix-comp-proxy folder is a C++20 compatibility mod based on remix-comp-base that intercepts `IDirect3DDevice9` and:

1. Captures vertex shader constants (View, Projection, World matrices) from `SetVertexShaderConstantF`
2. Parses `SetVertexDeclaration` to detect per-element attributes: BLENDWEIGHT+BLENDINDICES (skinned), POSITIONT (screen-space), NORMAL presence, and per-element byte offsets and types
3. Routes `DrawIndexedPrimitive` by vertex layout:
   - No NORMAL -> HUD/UI pass-through (uses different VS constant layout than world geometry)
   - Skinned with skinning module enabled -> FFP indexed vertex blending
   - Rigid 3D (has NORMAL) -> NULLs shaders, applies FFP transforms, draws
4. Routes `DrawPrimitive` by declaration state: world-space draws (have decl, no POSITIONT, not skinned) engage FFP; screen-space and no-decl draws pass through
5. Applies captured matrices via `SetTransform` (FFP)
6. Sets up texture stages and lighting for FFP rendering (stages 1-7 disabled to prevent stale auxiliary textures reaching Remix)
7. Chain-loads RTX Remix (`d3d9_remix.dll`)

The codebase is C++20 with a `build.bat` build script, component module system for extensibility.

## What Needs to Change Per Game

The VS constant register layout is defined in `src/shared/common/ffp_state.hpp` as member defaults. Edit these when porting, then rebuild:

```cpp
int vs_reg_view_start_ = 0;    int vs_reg_view_end_ = 4;
int vs_reg_proj_start_ = 4;    int vs_reg_proj_end_ = 8;
int vs_reg_world_start_ = 16;  int vs_reg_world_end_ = 20;
int vs_reg_bone_threshold_ = 20;   // first register treated as bone palette
int vs_regs_per_bone_ = 3;        // 3 = 4x3 packed, 4 = full 4x4
int vs_bone_min_regs_ = 3;        // min count to qualify as bone upload
```

**Bone config:** Run `find_skinning.py` to determine bone start register and upload pattern. Some games upload all bones at once; others upload in groups until hitting a max (e.g., groups of 15, max 75). If grouped, lower `vs_bone_min_regs_`. If bone uploads overlap with non-bone constants, raise `vs_reg_bone_threshold_`.

Beyond the INI config, users may need to modify:
- `renderer.cpp` `on_draw_indexed_prim()` -- draw call routing (which draws get FFP vs shader pass-through)
- `renderer.cpp` `on_draw_primitive()` -- UI/particle handling
- `ffp_state.cpp` `setup_lighting()`, `setup_texture_stages()`, `apply_transforms()` -- FFP render state and matrix configuration
- `AlbedoStage` in `remix-comp-proxy.ini` `[FFP]` section -- which texture stage holds the diffuse/albedo

## Porting Workflow

Follow these steps in order for ideal results. Each step depends on the previous. Be sure to use the Vibe Reverse Engineering tools (retools, livetools) for static and dynamic analysis as well. You do not need to strictly follow the order laid out here.

### Step 1a: Static Analysis

Run the analysis scripts to understand the game's D3D9 usage:

```bash
python rtx_remix_tools/dx/scripts/find_d3d_calls.py "<game.exe>"
python rtx_remix_tools/dx/scripts/find_vs_constants.py "<game.exe>"
python rtx_remix_tools/dx/scripts/decode_vtx_decls.py "<game.exe>" --scan
python rtx_remix_tools/dx/scripts/find_device_calls.py "<game.exe>"
python rtx_remix_tools/dx/scripts/find_skinning.py "<game.exe>"
python rtx_remix_tools/dx/scripts/find_blend_states.py "<game.exe>"
```

Key things to find:
- How the game obtains its D3D device (Direct3DCreate9 call site -> CreateDevice call)
- Which functions call `SetVertexShaderConstantF` and with what register/count patterns
- What vertex declaration formats the game uses (BLENDWEIGHT/BLENDINDICES = skinning)
- Where the main rendering loop/draw calls live

### Step 1b: D3D9 Frame Trace (recommended -- fastest path to answers)

Deploy the D3D9 tracer (`graphics/directx/dx9/tracer/bin/`) to the game directory, capture 2 frames, then run analysis. This is the fastest way to answer all three porting questions without manual RE:

```bash
python -m graphics.directx.dx9.tracer trigger --game-dir <GAME_DIR>
python -m graphics.directx.dx9.tracer analyze <trace.jsonl> --shader-map
python -m graphics.directx.dx9.tracer analyze <trace.jsonl> --const-provenance
python -m graphics.directx.dx9.tracer analyze <trace.jsonl> --vtx-formats
python -m graphics.directx.dx9.tracer analyze <trace.jsonl> --render-passes --pipeline-diagram
```

- `--shader-map` -- CTAB disassembly shows named parameters and register mappings (e.g. `WorldViewProj c0 4`, `WorldView c4 3`, `FogValue c8 1`). Directly reveals which constant registers hold View, Projection, and World matrices.
- `--const-provenance` -- shows which `SetVertexShaderConstantF` call set each register at each draw
- `--vtx-formats` -- groups draws by vertex declaration with full element breakdown (POSITION, NORMAL, BLENDWEIGHT, etc.)
- `--render-passes` + `--pipeline-diagram` -- shows the render pipeline structure and pass types
- `--classify-draws` -- auto-tags draws by render state (alpha, ztest, fog, etc.)

### Step 2: Discover VS Constant Layout

This is the **most critical** step. You must determine which VS constant registers hold View, Projection, and World matrices.

**Static approach:** Decompile functions that call `SetVertexShaderConstantF`:
```bash
python -m retools.decompiler <game.exe> <call_site_addr> --types patches/<project>/kb.h
```

**Dynamic approach:** Trace `SetVertexShaderConstantF` calls live:
```bash
python -m livetools trace <call_addr> --count 50 \
    --read "[esp+8]:4:uint32; [esp+10]:4:uint32; *[esp+c]:64:float32"
```
This captures: startRegister, Vector4fCount, and the actual float data (first 4 vec4 constants, dereferenced from `pConstantData`).

**How to identify matrices:**
- View matrix: changes with camera movement, contains camera orientation
- Projection matrix: contains aspect ratio and FOV, rarely changes
- World matrix: changes per object, contains position/rotation/scale
- Look for 4x4 matrices (16 floats = 4 registers). Row 3 often has `[0, 0, 0, 1]` for affine transforms.

### Step 3: Set Up Per-Game Project

Copy the entire `rtx_remix_tools/dx/remix-comp-proxy/` folder to `patches/<GameName>/` (excluding `build/`). The game folder is now self-contained. Edit files directly:

1. Edit register layout defaults in `src/shared/common/ffp_state.hpp`
2. Edit `src/comp/main.cpp`: set `WINDOW_CLASS_NAME` to the game's window class
3. Customize `src/comp/modules/renderer.cpp` draw routing if needed
4. Customize `src/comp/game/game.cpp` with game-specific hooks
5. Update `kb.h` with discovered function signatures, structs, and globals

### Step 4: Build and Deploy

```bash
cd patches/<GameName>
build.bat release --name <GameName>
```

Deploy to game directory: `d3d9.dll` + `remix-comp-proxy.ini`. If using Remix, also place `d3d9_remix.dll` there.

### Step 5: Diagnose with Log and ImGui

The proxy writes `ffp_proxy.log` in the game directory. After a configurable delay (default 50 seconds via `[Diagnostics] DelayMs`), it logs frames of detailed draw call data:

- **VS regs written**: shows which constant registers the game actually fills
- **Vertex declarations**: what vertex elements each draw uses (POSITION, NORMAL, TEXCOORD, BLENDWEIGHT, etc.)
- **Draw calls**: primitive type, vertex count, index count, textures bound per stage
- **Matrices**: actual View/Proj/World values being applied

Press **F4** to open the ImGui debug overlay, which shows the FFP debug tab with live draw call stats and state information.

Use this to iterate: wrong matrices -> re-check register mapping. Missing textures -> adjust AlbedoStage. Objects at wrong positions -> world matrix register is wrong.

## Architecture Details for Editing

### Code Map: Edit vs Do-Not-Touch

**Only edit sections marked YES or MAYBE:**

| File / Section | Edit Per-Game? |
|----------------|----------------|
| `ffp_state.hpp` register layout defaults | **YES** -- set register layout |
| `remix-comp-proxy.ini` `[Skinning] Enabled=` | **YES** -- only after rigid FFP works |
| `remix-comp-proxy.ini` `[FFP] AlbedoStage=` | **YES** -- set albedo texture stage |
| `renderer.cpp` `on_draw_indexed_prim()` | **YES** -- main draw routing |
| `renderer.cpp` `on_draw_primitive()` | **YES** -- draw routing for non-indexed draws |
| `ffp_state.cpp` `setup_lighting()`, `setup_texture_stages()`, `apply_transforms()` | MAYBE -- tweak if game needs different FFP state |
| `ffp_state.cpp` `on_set_vertex_declaration()` | MAYBE -- element parsing; add extra usages if needed |
| `ffp_state.cpp` `on_set_vs_const_f()` | MAYBE -- dirty tracking |
| `d3d9ex.cpp` hook implementations | NO -- infrastructure |
| `ffp_state.cpp` `engage()` / `disengage()` | NO -- enter/leave FFP mode |
| `skinning.cpp` | NO -- infrastructure (no per-game edits) |
| `diagnostics.cpp` | NO -- logging infrastructure |
| `imgui.cpp` | NO -- debug overlay |

### DrawIndexedPrimitive Decision Tree

This is the routing logic in `renderer.cpp` `on_draw_indexed_prim()`:

```
viewProjValid?
+-- NO  -> shader passthrough (transforms not captured yet)
+-- YES
    +-- curDeclIsSkinned?
    |   +-- YES + skinning module -> skinning::draw_skinned_dip()
    |   +-- YES + no skinning     -> shader passthrough
    +-- NOT skinned
        +-- !curDeclHasNormal -> shader passthrough (HUD/UI)
        +-- hasNormal -> ffp_state::engage + rigid FFP draw
```

**Common per-game changes to this tree:**
- Game's world geometry omits NORMAL -> remove or change the `!cur_decl_has_normal()` filter
- Game has special passes (shadow, reflection) -> filter by shader pointer, render target, or vertex count
- Game draws UI with DrawIndexedPrimitive + NORMAL -> add a filter (e.g. check stride or texture)

### DrawPrimitive Decision Tree

```
viewProjValid AND lastDecl AND !curDeclHasPosT AND !curDeclIsSkinned?
+-- YES -> ffp_state::engage (world-space particles, non-indexed geometry)
+-- NO  -> shader passthrough (screen-space UI, POSITIONT, no decl, skinned)
```

### Skinning Data Flow

When skinning is enabled via `[Skinning] Enabled=1` in `remix-comp-proxy.ini`:

1. **`ffp_state::on_set_vertex_declaration()`** -- Parses `D3DVERTEXELEMENT9` array. If both BLENDWEIGHT and BLENDINDICES are present, sets `cur_decl_is_skinned_` and captures per-element byte offsets and types.

2. **`ffp_state::on_set_vs_const_f()`** -- When a write hits registers >= `BoneThreshold` with count >= `BoneMinRegs` and divisible by `RegsPerBone`, stores `bone_start_reg_` and `num_bones_`.

3. **`skinning::draw_skinned_dip()`** -- Locks the game's source vertex buffer, calls `expand_skin_vertex()` per vertex, caches results by hash key.

4. **`skinning::upload_bones()`** -- Reads bone matrices from VS constants, transposes, uploads via `SetTransform(WORLDMATRIX(i))`. Sets `D3DRS_VERTEXBLEND` and `D3DRS_INDEXEDVERTEXBLENDENABLE`.

5. **Draw** -- The expanded VB + shared declaration are bound, draw executes with FFP indexed vertex blending. After the draw, original VB/decl/textures are restored.

### Key Component Notes

- **`ffp_state::engage()` / `disengage()`**: `engage()` NULLs shaders, applies transforms, sets up texture stages. `disengage()` restores the game's shaders. Avoids redundant state changes between consecutive FFP draw calls.
- **`ffp_state::apply_transforms()`**: Reads from the VS constant array using the INI register settings and calls `SetTransform` with transposed matrices (D3D9 FFP expects row-major).
- **ImGui overlay (F4)**: Shows live draw call stats, FFP conversion counts, and shader pass-through counts for real-time debugging.

## Analysis Scripts -- Entry Points, Not Endpoints

The scripts below are fast first-pass scanners. They surface candidate addresses and call sites to give you a starting point. They do **not** replace deep analysis -- always follow up with `retools` and `livetools` to understand what is actually happening.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Concatenated WVP/VP instead of separate matrices**: This is the **#1 Remix porting mistake**. Remix requires separate World, View, and Projection matrices passed via `SetTransform`. If the game uploads a pre-multiplied WorldViewProj or ViewProj to a single register range, the proxy gets a combined matrix it can't decompose. **Fix**: find where the game multiplies W*V*P and hook to capture individual matrices *before* concatenation. Use `find_matrix_registers.py` to detect this.
- **Matrices look wrong**: D3D9 FFP `SetTransform` expects row-major matrices. The proxy transposes them. If the game stores matrices column-major in VS constants (the common case), the transpose is correct. If the game is already row-major, remove the transpose in `ffp_state::apply_transforms()`.
- **Everything is white/black**: The game's albedo texture might be on stage 1+ instead of stage 0. Set `AlbedoStage` in `remix-comp-proxy.ini` `[FFP]` section, or trace `SetTexture` calls to find the pattern.
- **Some objects render, others don't**: `on_draw_primitive()` routes by vertex declaration -- world-space draws (have decl, no POSITIONT, not skinned) engage FFP; screen-space/no-decl pass through. `on_draw_indexed_prim()` additionally filters out draws without NORMAL as likely HUD/UI. If world geometry is missing, check whether its vertex decl has NORMAL and whether `view_proj_valid()` is true when those draws happen.
- **Skinned meshes are invisible**: Enable skinning with `[Skinning] Enabled=1` in `remix-comp-proxy.ini`. Check the log for bone count and declaration issues.
- **Game crashes on startup**: The chain-loaded Remix DLL might not be present. Set `Enabled=0` in `remix-comp-proxy.ini` `[Remix]` section to test without Remix first.
- **Geometry at origin / piled up**: World matrix register mapping is wrong. Every object gets identity world transform. Re-examine VS constant writes.
- **Characters' world geometry shifts after a skinned draw**: After uploading bone matrices, WORLDMATRIX(0) is clobbered by bone[0]. The proxy sets world dirty so `apply_transforms()` re-applies the world matrix on the next rigid draw. If this still causes issues, the bone threshold register may overlap with the world matrix register range.

## Notes
- Do not change the diagnostic logging delay (unless specified by the user). The delay is important to ensure the user is able to get into the game with actual geometry being drawn before the logs start, otherwise they may get lost in the initial burst of draw calls during loading.
- Tell the user when you want to launch a game and have them interact with it for logging or hooking purposes. They MUST interact with the game to have this task be useful.
