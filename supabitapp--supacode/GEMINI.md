## Architecture

Supacode is a macOS orchestrator for running multiple coding agents in parallel, using GhosttyKit as the underlying terminal.

### Core Data Flow

```
AppFeature (root TCA store)
├─ RepositoriesFeature (repos + folders, worktrees, PR state, archive/delete flows)
├─ CommandPaletteFeature
├─ SettingsFeature (general, notifications, coding agents, shortcuts, github, worktree, repo settings)
└─ UpdatesFeature (Sparkle auto-updates)

WorktreeTerminalManager (global @Observable terminal state)
├─ selectedWorktreeID (tracks current selection for bell logic)
└─ WorktreeTerminalState (per worktree)
    └─ TerminalTabManager (tab/split management)
        └─ GhosttySurfaceState[] (one per terminal surface)

WorktreeInfoWatcherManager (global worktree watcher state)
├─ HEAD watchers per worktree
└─ debounced branch / file / pull request refresh events

GhosttyRuntime (shared runtime)
└─ ghostty_app_t (single C instance)
    └─ ghostty_surface_t[] (independent terminal sessions)
```

### TCA ↔ Terminal Communication

The terminal layer (`WorktreeTerminalManager`) is `@Observable` but outside TCA. Communication uses `TerminalClient`:

```
Reducer → terminalClient.send(Command) → WorktreeTerminalManager
                                                    ↓
Reducer ← .terminalEvent(Event) ← AsyncStream<Event>
```

- **Commands**: tab creation, initial-tab setup, blocking scripts, search, Ghostty binding actions, tab/surface closing, notification toggles, and lifecycle management
- **Events**: notifications, dock indicator count changes, tab/focus changes, task status changes, blocking-script completion, command palette requests, and setup-script consumption
- Wired in `supacodeApp.swift`, subscribed in `AppFeature.appLaunched`

Worktree metadata refresh uses `WorktreeInfoWatcherClient` in parallel:

```
Reducer → worktreeInfoWatcher.send(Command) → WorktreeInfoWatcherManager
                                                           ↓
Reducer ← .repositories(.worktreeInfoEvent(Event)) ← AsyncStream<Event>
```

- **Commands**: `setWorktrees`, `setSelectedWorktreeID`, `setPullRequestTrackingEnabled`, `stop`
- **Events**: `branchChanged`, `filesChanged`, `repositoryPullRequestRefresh`
- Wired in `supacodeApp.swift`, subscribed in `AppFeature.appLaunched`

### Key Dependencies

- **TCA (swift-composable-architecture)**: App state, reducers, side effects
- **GhosttyKit**: Terminal emulator (built from Zig source in ThirdParty/ghostty)
- **Sparkle**: Auto-update framework
- **swift-dependencies**: Dependency injection for TCA clients
- **PostHog**: Analytics
- **Sentry**: Error tracking

## Ghostty Keybindings Handling

- Ghostty keybindings are handled via runtime action callbacks in `GhosttySurfaceBridge`, not by app menu shortcuts.
- App-level tab actions should be triggered by Ghostty actions (`GHOSTTY_ACTION_NEW_TAB` / `GHOSTTY_ACTION_CLOSE_TAB`) to honor user custom bindings.
- `GhosttySurfaceView.performKeyEquivalent` routes bound keys to Ghostty first; only unbound keys fall through to the app.

## Code Guidelines

- Target macOS 26.0+, Swift 6.0
- Before doing a big feature or when planning, consult with pfw (pointfree) skills on TCA, Observable best practices first.
- Use `@ObservableState` for TCA feature state; use `@Observable` for non-TCA shared stores; never `ObservableObject`
- Always mark `@Observable` classes with `@MainActor`
- Modern SwiftUI only: `foregroundStyle()`, `NavigationStack`, `Button` over `onTapGesture()`
- When a new logic changes in the Reducer, always add tests
- In unit tests, never use `Task.sleep`; use `TestClock` (or an injected clock) and drive time with `advance`.
- Prefer Swift-native APIs over Foundation where they exist (e.g., `replacing()` not `replacingOccurrences()`)
- Avoid `GeometryReader` when `containerRelativeFrame()` or `visualEffect()` would work
- Do not use NSNotification to communicate between reducers.
- Prefer `@Shared` directly in reducers for app storage and shared settings; do not introduce new dependency clients solely to wrap `@Shared`.
- Use `SupaLogger` for all logging. Never use `print()` or `os.Logger` directly. `SupaLogger` prints in DEBUG and uses `os.Logger` in release.

### Formatting & Linting

- 2-space indentation, 120 character line length (enforced by `.swift-format.json`)
- Trailing commas are mandatory (enforced by `.swiftlint.yml`)
- SwiftLint runs in strict mode; never disable lint rules without permission
- Custom SwiftLint rule: `store_state_mutation_in_views` — do not mutate `store.*` directly in view files; send actions instead

## UX Standards

- Buttons must have tooltips explaining the action and associated hotkey
- Use Dynamic Type, avoid hardcoded font sizes
- Components should be layout-agnostic (parents control layout, children control appearance)
- Never use custom colors, always use system provided ones.
- We use `.monospaced()` modifier on fonts when appropriate

## Rules

- After a task, ensure the app builds: `make build-app`
- Automatically commit your changes and your changes only. Do not use `git add .`
- Before you go on your task, check the current git branch name, if it's something generic like an animal name, name it accordingly. Do not do this for main branch
- After implementing an execplan, always submit a PR if you're not in the main branch

## Folder (non-git) repositories

- `Repository.isGitRepository` classifies each root at load time via `Repository.isGitRepository(at:)` (checks `.git` dir/file and the `.bare` / `.git` root-name conventions). Classification runs through the injected `GitClientDependency.isGitRepository` closure so tests can override it without touching the filesystem.
- A folder-kind repository has exactly one synthesized "main" `Worktree` with `id = "folder:" + path` (see `Repository.folderWorktreeID(for:)`), `workingDirectory == rootURL`. Selection and terminal binding reuse the standard `SidebarSelection.worktree(id)` machinery — nothing git-specific runs for folders.
- The sidebar renders each folder as its own `Section` with an empty header and a single selectable row. The context menu offers the same entries as a git worktree row, minus pin / archive / "Copy as Branch Name", plus "Folder Settings…" (the section has no header so there is no ellipsis menu).
- The Delete Script for a folder runs through the existing `.requestDeleteSidebarItems` → `.confirmDeleteSidebarItems` → `.deleteSidebarItemConfirmed` → `.deleteScriptCompleted` pipeline; the handlers branch inside so `gitClient.removeWorktree` is never called for a folder and the success path emits `.repositoryRemovalCompleted`, which the batch aggregator drains into a single `.repositoriesRemoved` terminal. `removingRepositoryIDs` is the source of truth for "this is a folder delete" so the intent survives a `git init` happening between confirmation and completion.
- Settings hides the Setup and Archive Script sections for folders; Delete Script and user-defined scripts stay. `openRepositorySettings` (context menu + deeplink) routes folders to `.repositoryScripts` because there is no general pane for them.
- `worktreesForInfoWatcher()` filters out folder repositories so the HEAD watcher never probes a non-git path. The command palette renders folder rows as the repo name alone instead of `Foo / Foo`, and worktree deeplinks (`.archive`, `.unarchive`, `.pin`, `.unpin`) reject folder targets with an explanatory alert.
- Creating new worktrees on a folder is rejected up front in `createRandomWorktreeInRepository` / `createWorktreeInRepository` and in the `.repoWorktreeNew` deeplink handler — the menu / hotkey / palette never reaches `gitClient.createWorktreeStream` for a folder target.

## Submodules

- `ThirdParty/ghostty` (`https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty`): Source dependency used to build `Frameworks/GhosttyKit.xcframework` and terminal resources.
- `Resources/git-wt` (`https://github.com/khoi/git-wt.git`): Bundled `wt` CLI used by Supacode Git worktree flows at runtime.
