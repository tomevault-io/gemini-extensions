### System Dependencies

**For end users:** Only FFmpeg is required. libgpod is statically linked into prebuilt binaries.

| Dependency | Debian/Ubuntu | macOS | Alpine | Required for |
|------------|---------------|-------|--------|--------------|
| FFmpeg | `ffmpeg` | `brew install ffmpeg` | `ffmpeg` | Users + developers |
| libgpod | `libgpod-dev` | Build from source (see `tools/libgpod-macos/`) | `libgpod-dev` (community) | Development only |
| GLib | `libglib2.0-dev` | `brew install glib` (installed as libgpod dep) | `glib-dev` | Development only |
| util-linux | Pre-installed | N/A | `lsblk` | Linux device manager |
| Lima | N/A | `brew install lima` | N/A | Cross-platform testing |

See [docs/developers/development.md](docs/developers/development.md) for full setup instructions.

## Documentation

The `docs/` directory is organized for web publication (Starlight-compatible). Read [agents/documentation.md](agents/documentation.md) for the full documentation map, file conventions, and maintenance guidelines.

## Feature Requests & GitHub Discussions

Feature requests are managed through GitHub Discussions (Ideas category), with links in the documentation and backlog tasks. **See [agents/feature-requests.md](agents/feature-requests.md) for the complete guide** covering:

- Creating, updating, and closing discussions via the GitHub API
- The current discussions registry (all feature discussions with numbers and URLs)
- Which doc files reference which discussions and how to update them
- Workflows for moving features between roadmap tiers
- How discussions, docs, and backlog tasks stay in sync

When working on anything related to feature requests, planned features, or the roadmap, read that file first.

## Task Management (Backlog.md)

This project uses Backlog.md for task management via MCP tools. **Never edit backlog files directly** — always use the MCP tools.

### When to Create Tasks

**Create a task** when work requires planning or decisions (investigating bugs, designing features, choosing approaches).

**Skip tasks** for trivial/mechanical changes (typos, version bumps, obvious one-line fixes).

### Workflow

1. **Search first:** Use `task_search` or `task_list` to find existing related work
2. **View details:** Use `task_view` to understand existing task scope and progress
3. **Create if needed:** Use `task_create` for new work (consult `get_task_creation_guide` for structure)
4. **Update progress:** Use `task_edit` to update status, add notes, check acceptance criteria
5. **Mark done:** Set status to "Done" when complete (do not use `task_complete` — that's for batch cleanup)

### MCP Tools Reference

```
Guides:     get_workflow_overview, get_task_creation_guide,
            get_task_execution_guide, get_task_finalization_guide
Tasks:      task_list, task_search, task_view, task_create, task_edit
Documents:  document_list, document_view, document_create, document_update
```

## Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

ADRs document significant technical decisions. See [adr/](adr/) for the full workflow.

### When to Create ADRs

- **Research tasks:** Create an ADR to capture findings and recommendations
- **Architectural changes:** Document the decision and alternatives considered
- **Technology choices:** Record why a library/pattern/approach was chosen

**Guidance:**
- If clearly significant (new package, binding strategy, data model) → create ADR without asking
- If unsure and working interactively → ask the user
- If unsure and working autonomously → create the ADR (easier to delete than reconstruct reasoning)

### Referencing ADRs

- Link ADRs in backlog tasks that implement them
- Update ADR status to "Accepted" when implementation begins
- Reference ADRs in code comments for non-obvious decisions

## Key Technical Decisions

These decisions are documented in ADRs — read the full ADR for context:

| Decision | Summary | ADR |
|----------|---------|-----|
| Runtime | Bun for dev, Node.js for distribution | [ADR-001](adr/adr-001-runtime.md) |
| libgpod bindings | N-API (node-addon-api) directly | [ADR-002](adr/adr-002-libgpod-binding.md) |
| Transcoding | FFmpeg with AAC encoder | [ADR-003](adr/adr-003-transcoding.md) |
| Collection sources | Adapter pattern | [ADR-004](adr/adr-004-collection-sources.md) |
| Test environments | gpod-tool + temp directories | [ADR-005](adr/adr-005-test-ipod-environment.md) |
| Video transcoding | FFmpeg with H.264/M4V output | [ADR-006](adr/adr-006-video-transcoding.md) |
| Self-healing sync | Detect and upgrade changed source files | [ADR-009](adr/adr-009-self-healing-sync.md) |
| Artwork change detection | Hash-based artwork diffing with opt-in scanning | [ADR-012](adr/adr-012-artwork-change-detection.md) |

## Testing

Read [agents/testing.md](agents/testing.md) when writing, running, or debugging tests.

Quick reference: `bun run test:unit --filter <package>` for targeted tests, `bun run test` for all, `bun test path/to/file.test.ts` for a single file.

## libgpod-node: Native Bindings

Read [agents/libgpod-node.md](agents/libgpod-node.md) when modifying the N-API bindings or investigating libgpod edge cases.

## Demo GIF

Read [agents/demo.md](agents/demo.md) when making CLI or core changes that could affect the demo recording.

## Shell Completions

Read [agents/shell-completions.md](agents/shell-completions.md) when modifying CLI commands or options.

## Docker Image

Read [agents/docker.md](agents/docker.md) when working on Docker distribution, the entrypoint, or daemon mode.

## Virtual iPod

The virtual iPod system creates a synthetic iPod for demonstrating podkit. It consists of four packages and a Lima VM. See [backlog/docs/doc-028](backlog/docs/doc-028%20-%20Virtual-iPod-Architecture-and-Package-Design.md) for the full architecture document and [tools/demo/README.md](tools/demo/README.md) for the live demo guide.

**Packages:**
- `@podkit/ipod-db` — Pure TypeScript iTunesDB/ArtworkDB parser. Browser-compatible (DataView-based, no Node.js Buffer). Used by ipod-web to read real iPod databases. Shares foundational work with the libgpod-node replacement (m-8).
- `@podkit/ipod-web` — React + Jotai iPod 5th gen UI component. Reusable — works in browser, Tauri, or any web context. Click wheel with rotational drag + keyboard. Menu state machine, playback engine, Now Playing screen. StorageProvider interface with RemoteStorage (HTTP/WS) and BrowserStorage (stub).
- `@podkit/virtual-ipod-server` — Runs inside a Lima VM. Manages USB gadget via configfs + dummy_hcd (Apple vendor/product IDs). Serves iPod filesystem over REST + WebSocket. podkit sees the virtual device as a real iPod with zero code changes.
- `@podkit/virtual-ipod-app` — Tauri v2 macOS app. Frameless transparent window shaped like an iPod. Manages Lima VM lifecycle.

**Lima VM (`tools/lima/virtual-ipod.yaml`):**
- Debian 12 with dummy_hcd + configfs USB gadget support
- `mise run vipod:install` rsyncs source to `/opt/podkit/` (VM-local, won't touch macOS node_modules), builds, and installs podkit binary to `/usr/local/bin`
- `mise run vipod:shell` drops into an isolated `james@lima-virtual-ipod:~$` with podkit in PATH and tab completion

**Milestone:** m-17 (Virtual iPod). Tasks tracked in backlog.

## Code Conventions

- TypeScript strict mode
- Bun test runner
- ESM modules

## Release Workflow

Read [agents/releases.md](agents/releases.md) when creating changesets, reviewing release PRs, or publishing releases.

Quick reference: `bunx changeset` to create a changeset. Required for user-facing changes to `podkit`, `@podkit/core`, `@podkit/libgpod-node`, `@podkit/daemon` or `@podkit/docker`.

Docs site deploys from a dedicated `docs-live` branch, not from `main`. Releases sync `docs-live` automatically; docs-only updates between releases require a cherry-pick from `main` to `docs-live`. See the "Docs Site Deployment" section in [agents/releases.md](agents/releases.md).

## Config Migrations

Read [agents/config-migrations.md](agents/config-migrations.md) when making breaking changes to the config file format.

## Device Profiles

The `devices/` directory contains structured documentation for portable music players that podkit supports or may support in the future. Each file uses markdown with a YAML frontmatter block covering device specs, audio format support, metadata handling, artwork, playlists, and features.

Use `devices/TEMPLATE.md` when documenting a new device. Current profiles: `ipod.md` (stock firmware), `rockbox.md`, `echo-mini.md`.

When implementing support for a new device, read its profile first. When researching a device, update or create its profile with findings.
