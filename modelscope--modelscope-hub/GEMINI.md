# AGENTS.md — modelscope_hub Engineering Conventions

This document defines repository-level engineering conventions that apply to every automated or manual change in this repository. In addition to the general requirements, it **strictly governs changes to the `upload_folder` upload path**: every change that touches this path must perform the specified scenario-based simulation review and include an Upload Simulation Regression Report.

---

## 1. General Engineering Requirements

- This repository uses a src-layout. Always run code and tests against local sources: `PYTHONPATH=src` (a package installed with `pip install` may be outdated).
- Before committing, run the following gates in order; all must pass:
  1. Targeted unit tests: `PYTHONPATH=src pytest -q <relevant tests>`
  2. Full non-remote test suite: `PYTHONPATH=src pytest -q tests/ -k 'not remote' --ignore=tests/integration`
  3. Style checks: `ruff check src/ tests/` and `ruff format --check src/ tests/`
  4. Type checks: `mypy src/modelscope_hub/`
- Never commit secrets. `~/.modelscope/credentials/` is private (it contains a pickled cookie jar and `m_session_id`); never expose its contents in logs or reports.
- When changing the default value of a configuration constant, update the corresponding tests for its default value and registration table, as well as the environment-variable table in `README.md`.

---

## 2. Controlled Scope: `upload_folder` Path

Changing any of the following files or symbols constitutes a change to the upload path and requires the mandatory simulation regression in Section 5:

- `src/modelscope_hub/_upload.py`
  - Batching: `_calculate_adaptive_batch_size`, `_plan_commit_batches`, `_estimate_commit_operation_bytes`, `_plan_result_batches`
  - Routing: `_is_lfs`, `_is_inline_metadata`, `_upload_mode`
  - Main flow and recovery: `upload_folder`, `_retry_failed_commits`, `_retry_failed_files_react`, `_retry_failed_simple`, `_commit_with_retry`
  - Failure classification: `classify_error`, `_ErrorCategory`, `_is_retryable_commit_error`
  - Preflight validation: `_warn_advisory_upload_limits`, `_prepare_upload_folder`
  - State tracking: `UploadTracker` (`begin_attempt` / `mark_*`)
- `src/modelscope_hub/errors.py`: `raise_for_status`, `_COMMIT_RETRYABLE_BUSINESS_CODES`, and HTTP/business-code mappings
- `src/modelscope_hub/_legacy_api.py`: `create_commit`, including the HTTP 200 / `Success:false` check
- `src/modelscope_hub/constants.py`: upload-related constants such as `UPLOAD_*` and `COMMIT_MAX_ACTIONS_PER_REQUEST`

---

## 3. Commit Batching Semantics That Must Be Preserved

Only files that are **pending** (not `COMMITTED`) for the current run are planned into batches. This prevents a resumed upload from turning a small number of remaining files into multiple tiny commits.

Apply the following three constraints; start a new batch as soon as any constraint is reached:

1. **Operation target (primary constraint):** `UPLOAD_COMMIT_BATCH_MAX_OPERATIONS`, default `256`. `_calculate_adaptive_batch_size` must return `min(target, 2000, pending_count)`—for fewer files, it converges to the pending count and by default never exceeds `256`.
2. **Request-body budget (secondary constraint):** `UPLOAD_COMMIT_MAX_INLINE_BYTES`, default `8 MiB`. Count only normal files, using base64 expansion (`×4/3`) plus JSON overhead. For LFS files, count only pointer metadata (about `370 B/op`); **never include blob payload bytes**.
3. **Server hard limit:** `COMMIT_MAX_ACTIONS_PER_REQUEST=2000`. Clamp to this limit in every case; it must never be exceeded.

The following behavior must also be preserved:

- **Tail-batch rebalancing:** when `last_batch × 4 < previous_batch` and both rebalanced halves meet all constraints, rebalance the final two batches (for example, `256/32 → 144/144`). Do not add commits, and preserve deterministic path order.
- **Oversized inline fallback:** if one inline file alone exceeds the budget, place it in its own batch and emit a warning; the upload must not stall.
- **Recovery uses the same planner:** `_retry_failed_commits`, ReAct recovery, and simple retry must all use `_plan_result_batches` (and therefore the same `_plan_commit_batches`).
- **`delete_files` batches independently:** split only at the hard limit of `2000`, not at `256`.
- **`upload_file`:** one file and one commit per call; no batching and no tracker.

### Routing Rules: LFS vs. Inline

- Files matched by `_is_inline_metadata` (such as `README.md`, `.gitattributes`, `.gitignore`, and `config*.json`) are **always inline**.
- Otherwise, `size > UPLOAD_LFS_FORCE_THRESHOLD_BYTES` (default **64 KiB**) routes to LFS.
- Otherwise, files matching `DATASET_LFS_SUFFIX` or `MODEL_LFS_SUFFIX` route to LFS.
- All other files are normal inline files.

---

## 4. Failure and Retry Model That Must Be Preserved

- Failures have three categories, and **all of them must be included in final statistics**:
  - `retry_failed_files`: transport failure → ReAct recovery (parallel or serial retries, backoff, then single-file handling).
  - `retry_commit_batches`: retryable commit failure → **commit-only recovery** (do not re-upload blobs).
  - `terminal_failures`: non-retryable in the current run; record as `FAILED` in the tracker and include in the final `Failed` count.
- **Retryability in commit context** (`_is_retryable_commit_error` / `classify_error(commit_context=True)`):
  - Business code `10030000001` ("branch changed, please retry" / "commit rejected by repository policy") is retryable only at a `/commit/` endpoint; `raise_for_status` maps it to `ServerError`.
  - During commit-only recovery, policy-related rejections recursively split batches in half by file count, down to individual files.
  - Genuine parameter errors (for example, an invalid-path E3021, a 400 without a policy code, or 401/403/404) remain **non-retryable**.
- **HTTP 200 with `Success:false`:** `LegacyClient.create_commit` must raise `APIError` and enter the unified failure path; false successes are prohibited.
- **Abort after consecutive failures:** after `UPLOAD_COMMIT_MAX_CONSECUTIVE_FAILED_BATCHES` (default `3`) batches fail completely in succession, the main flow must raise `RuntimeError`. The tracker must already be persisted so that the upload can be resumed.
- **Manual rerun semantics (mandatory):** regardless of the prior error, skip only `COMMITTED` entries. `FAILED`, `UPLOADED`, and missing entries must re-enter the full upload-and-commit path; `begin_attempt` clears the previous `error_type`. A terminal failure must raise `StorageError` and suppress synchronous deletion.
- **Advisory preflight limits:** capacity-related thresholds (total file count, files per directory, individual file size, and total normal-file bytes) must only warn and never block. Structural errors (an empty `repo_id`, empty input, a nonexistent or out-of-bound path, invalid `repo_type`, or a file modified during upload), together with the server's hard limit of `2000`, remain enforced constraints.

## 5. Mandatory Simulation Regression for Upload-Path Changes

> Rule: **Before committing any change within the scope in Section 2, perform a scenario-based simulation review of every case below and include an Upload Simulation Regression Report in the delivery notes.** A simulation is a logical derivation from the code's current strategy and must match the implementation. If a conclusion changes because of the current change, explicitly document the before/after difference and its cause.

### 5.1 Required Dataset-Scale Scenarios

| ID | Dataset characteristics | Required simulated conclusions |
|---|---|---|
| D1 | 1 TB / 2 million files, from tens of KiB to tens of MiB | Routing distribution, blob PUT order of magnitude, presign request count, commit-batch order of magnitude, rate-limit risk, memory and hashing overhead |
| D2 | 50 GB / 20 thousand files | Nearly all LFS, presign count, commit-batch count (including tail-batch rebalancing), dominant costs |
| D3 | 5 GB / 2 thousand files | Commit-batch count and tail behavior (including whether rebalancing applies), blob-dominated cost |
| D4 | 200 GB / 10 files | All LFS, **one commit**, blob-transfer dominated, no capacity warning |
| DX | 1,000 files × 1 GB | All LFS, the 8 MiB budget does not apply, commit batches (`256×3+232=4`), approximately 1,000 PUTs |

For every scenario, derive at least: the LFS/normal routing result, the `_calculate_adaptive_batch_size` target, `_plan_commit_batches` count plus operations and estimated body size per batch, blob PUT count, presign request count, advisory warnings triggered, and resume behavior.

### 5.2 Required Error-Type Scenarios

For each error below, describe its classification, whether it is automatically retried in the current run, its handling path, and its final outcome:

- Transport-layer network failure or timeout (`E1020` / `E1001`, blob stage)
- Commit 5xx (`E1002`)
- 429 rate limiting (`E1021`), including `Retry-After` and the configured limit
- 409 branch changed / 400 repository policy (business code `10030000001`, `/commit/`)
- HTTP 200 + `Success:false`
- Genuine parameter error (invalid-path E3021 without a policy code)
- Authentication, authorization, or nonexistent resource (`E3001` / `E3002` / `E3020`)
- File modified during upload (size mismatch)
- Shared blob owner failure (replicas are deferred)
- Three consecutive batches failing completely (protective abort and resumable rerun)

### 5.3 Upload Simulation Regression Report Template

```
# upload_folder Simulation Regression Report
- Change summary / affected Section 2 symbols:
- Baseline configuration snapshot: LFS threshold / 256 / 8 MiB / 2000 / recovery switches / consecutive-failure threshold
- Dataset scenario derivations: D1 / D2 / D3 / D4 / DX (routing, blob PUTs, presigning, commit batches with operations and body sizes, warnings, resume behavior)
- Error-type behavior: each item (classification / automatic retry / handling path / final outcome)
- Difference from the previous version: behavior changed by this modification and the reason (write "None" if there is no difference)
- Automated validation: pytest / ruff / mypy results
- Conclusion: compliance with the semantics in Sections 3 and 4; risks and tuning recommendations
```

### 5.4 Required Automated Validation (Run in Parallel with the Simulation)

- `PYTHONPATH=src pytest -q tests/test_upload_batching.py tests/test_commit_action_limit.py tests/test_errors_openapi_codes.py tests/test_upload_config.py tests/test_upload_lfs_gate.py tests/test_upload_blob_dedup.py`
- If error mappings changed, additionally run `tests/test_login_failure_paths.py`.
- The full non-remote suite, ruff, and mypy must pass.

## 6. Change Checklist

After changing the upload path, check whether the following must be updated as well:

- `tests/`: assertions for batching, errors, configuration, deduplication, LFS gating, and related behavior—especially assertions for default values.
- The upload environment-variable table and semantic documentation in `README.md`.
- `__all__` exports and compatibility aliases in `src/modelscope_hub/compat/` and `constants.py`.
- This file, if new constants, error codes, or scenarios were introduced.
