# Claude AI Rules

This document contains rules and guidelines for Claude AI when working on this project.

## Communication

- Do not create a summary document on every fix

## Philosophy

Our development approach follows this priority order:

1. **Delete** - First, delete as much code as possible
2. **Simplify** - Second, simplify what remains
3. **Optimize** - Third, optimize if needed

## Python Development

- We use Python 3.10 typing
- For tests we use pytest and parametrize
- We use Google type docstrings
- To check syntax we do not run ruff, flake8, but just run `pre-commit run --all-files`

## Testing

- We use extensive testing
