# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

- `npm run build`: `tsc` to `dist/` (ESM, NodeNext). `tests/`, `references/`, `dist/` are excluded.
- `npm test`: `vitest` in watch mode.
- `npm run test:run`: one-shot run of the whole suite (unit + live E2E, ~60s total).
- `npx vitest run tests/e2e`: just the live providers.
- `npx vitest run tests/e2e/allmanga.test.ts`: single E2E file.
- `npx vitest run -t "rewriteManifest"`: single test by name pattern.
  `pnpm` is also configured (`pnpm-lock.yaml`, `pnpm-workspace.yaml`): either pkg manager works.

Requires Node 20+ and `ffmpeg` on `PATH` (E2E suite shells out to it).

## Architecture

The SDK has three layers, all wired around a single `HttpClient`:

**1. Transport (`src/transport/`)**: site-agnostic plumbing.

- `HttpClient` wraps `fetch` with a **curl fallback** that fires automatically on Node when `fetch` errors out (timeout, TLS quirks, anti-bot rejection). The fallback synthesizes a `Response`-shaped object so callers don't see the difference. It also supports two proxy routing modes (`prepend` puts the proxy in front of `host/path`; `query` passes the URL as a query param): `requestUrl(url)` is the single chokepoint for that rewrite.
- `DomRegistry` is a global single-parser registry. `BrowserDomParser` works in browsers; in Node, consumers (and the E2E tests' `beforeAll`) must shim `globalThis.DOMParser` via `linkedom` before any provider parses HTML. Providers call `DomRegistry.parse(html)`: they never touch `DOMParser` directly.
- `HlsUtils.rewriteManifest` rewrites every URI line in an `.m3u8` (including `URI="…"` inside `#EXT-X-KEY` / `#EXT-X-MAP`) so chunk fetches go through the same proxy as the manifest fetch.

**2. Extractors (`src/extractors/`)**: stateless, take only an embed URL and an `HttpClient`, return `IVideoPayload[]` (empty if they can't recover a direct stream). `BaseExtractor` is the contract. They're independently usable: a consumer can hand any embed URL to `BloggerExtractor` without involving a provider.

**3. Providers (`src/providers/`)**: site-specific. `BaseProvider` defines `search` → `fetchContentUnits(mediaId)` → `resolveStream(unitId, language?)`. `fetchContentUnits` is **language-agnostic** and returns one unified list; each `IContentUnit` carries `availableLanguages: ContentLanguage[]` so the caller picks the translation at `resolveStream` time. Providers may optionally implement `fetchUnitTracks(unitId, language?): Promise<IUnitTracks>` to expose subtitle/quality metadata without paying the `resolveStream` cost. `IVideoPayload.subtitles?: ISubtitleTrack[]` carries playable VTT URLs alongside the stream. Each provider composes one or more extractors:

- `AnimeParadiseProvider`: `api.animeparadise.moe` REST. `/anime/{id}/episode` for the list (sub only). `/ep/{uid}?origin={animeId}` returns the playable HLS link **and** `subData`, which `normalizeSubtitleEntries` (in `utils/subtitles.ts`) turns into VTT-only `ISubtitleTrack[]`. Implements `fetchUnitTracks` cheaply (just `/ep`, no stream URL resolution).
- `AllmangaProvider`: AllAnime GraphQL → AES-CTR-decrypted `tobeparsed` payload → `Mp4UploadExtractor`, with a `clock.json` fallback for wixmp/sharepoint sources. Source URLs are obfuscated with a `--<hex>` scheme XOR'd with `0x38`; see `decodeAllAnimeSource`. `fetchContentUnits` merges `availableEpisodesDetail.sub` + `.dub` + `.raw` into a single language-agnostic list; unit IDs are `${mediaId}/${epStr}` (legacy `${mediaId}/${epStr}/${lang}` IDs still resolve).
- `AnikotoProvider`: HTML scrape of `anikototv.to`; uses `anikotoapi.site` for episodes, then delegates to MegaPlay embed for stream/subtitles.
- `GogoanimeProvider`: HTML scrape of `anineko.to`; vibeplayer embed → `master.m3u8` via `GenericHlsExtractor`.
- `GoyabuProvider`: pulls a Blogger token from `playersData`, calls Google `batchexecute` to recover the `googlevideo.com` URL via `BloggerExtractor`.
- `MangadexProvider`: Official JSON API at `api.mangadex.org` for high-quality manga.
- `MangapillProvider`: HTML scrape of `mangapill.com` for manga.
- `MegaPlayProvider`: AniList GraphQL for search/episodes; resolves directly against MegaPlay's mapping endpoints.
- `WeebcentralProvider`: HTML scrape of `weebcentral.com` for manga.

All public surface is re-exported from `src/index.ts`, including the shared subtitle utilities (`normalizeSubtitleEntries`, `proxifySubtitleUrl`).

**4. Server (`src/server/index.ts`)**: `startServer({ providers, port, proxy, cache, auth })`. Routes: `GET /search`, `/content`, `/stream`, `/tracks`, plus `/proxy` when `proxy: true`. `/proxy` accepts `url`, `h` (base64-JSON headers), and `ct` (Content-Type override: used to force `text/vtt` on VTT subtitles whose CDNs serve `application/octet-stream`). When `proxy: true`, both stream `sourceUrl`s **and** subtitle URLs returned by `/stream` and `/tracks` are rewritten through `/proxy`. `cache?: SdkCache` is an optional `{get,set}` interface (sync or async) that memoizes provider calls by namespaced keys (`search:<id>:<q>`, `content:<id>:<mid>`, `stream:<id>:<uid>:<lang>`, `tracks:<id>:<uid>:<lang>`). `/tracks` returns **501** for providers that don't implement `fetchUnitTracks`: clients should fall back to the `subtitles` field already present on `/stream` responses. The example `examples/server.mjs` wires a `new Map()` as the cache.

## ESM import convention

`tsconfig.json` uses `module: NodeNext`, so **all relative imports in `src/` must include the `.js` extension** (even though source is `.ts`). New files must follow this: `import { X } from './foo.js'`, never `'./foo'`.

## Tests

- **Unit tests** (`tests/*.test.ts`) cover `HttpClient`, `HlsUtils`, `DomRegistry`, extractor parsing, language inference.
- **E2E tests** (`tests/e2e/*.test.ts`) are intentionally **not mocked**. Each searches a popular title, picks an episode, resolves the stream, and runs it through `captureStreamScreenshot`: which probes URLs with a Range GET (`Content-Type` + MP4 `ftyp` magic) to distinguish embed pages from raw video, fetches an HLS segment ~5s in, strips PNG-wrapped segments, and runs `ffmpeg` to extract a frame. Output lands in `scratch/screenshots/screenshot_<provider>.png` (gitignored). Assertion: the PNG is >1KB. Don't try to make these tests pass by mocking: the whole point is to catch upstream site changes.
- Each E2E test sets `vitest` `timeout: 90000`: these are slow and that's expected.
- `references/` (cloned source from `ani-cli`, `animdl`, `GoAnime`, `mov-cli`) is gitignored prior art for site-scraping logic; not part of the build or tests.

## Provider/extractor additions

When adding a provider:

- Extend `BaseProvider`, set `id` and `supportedTypes`, accept `HttpClient` in the constructor.
- Compose existing extractors where possible; only add a new extractor if the embed format is genuinely novel.
- Re-export from `src/index.ts`.
- Add a live E2E test that resolves a real stream and screenshots it.
