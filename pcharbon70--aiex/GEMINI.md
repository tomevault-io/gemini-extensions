# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Aiex is a sophisticated distributed AI-powered Elixir coding assistant currently in Phase 6 of a 9-phase development roadmap. The project has built extensive distributed infrastructure using pure OTP primitives and is now implementing the core AI assistant application logic that provides actual coding assistance capabilities. Aiex leverages Elixir's strengths in concurrency, fault tolerance, and distributed computing to create a production-ready AI coding assistant.

## Current State (End of Phase 5)

Aiex has completed 5 major phases and now has sophisticated distributed infrastructure in place:

- **Distributed OTP Architecture**: Complete with pg process group coordination, Mnesia persistence, and event sourcing
- **Multi-LLM Integration**: 4 providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, LM Studio) with intelligent coordination, circuit breakers, and health monitoring
- **Advanced Context Management**: Semantic chunking, context compression, and distributed synchronization across nodes
- **Sophisticated TUI**: Rust-based terminal interface with real-time OTP communication via TCP/MessagePack
- **Event Sourcing System**: Complete audit trail with distributed event bus using pg module
- **Multiple Interfaces**: CLI, TUI, Mix tasks with unified business logic through InterfaceGateway
- **Security & Sandboxing**: Path validation, audit logging, and secure file operations
- **Rich Terminal Features**: Syntax highlighting, real-time context awareness, and multi-panel layouts

**What's Missing**: The actual AI assistant logic that provides coding assistance (analysis, generation, explanation, refactoring).

## Working Method

We use a structured approach combining todo tracking with documentation for implementing AI assistant features.

### Current Phase 6 Workflow:

1. **Todo Tracking**: Use TodoWrite/TodoRead tools to track AI assistant implementation progress
2. **Plan Before Implementation**: Always create and review plans before coding (NO EXCEPTIONS!)
3. **Test-Driven Development**: Write comprehensive tests for all AI functionality
4. **Integration Testing**: Ensure AI engines work with existing distributed infrastructure
5. **Documentation**: Document AI assistant patterns and integration points

### Feature Implementation Workflow:

1. **Plan Phase**: Collaborate on design, save plan in `/notes/features/<number>-<name>.md` under `## Plan` heading
2. **Implementation Phase**: Store notes, findings, issues in `/notes/features/<number>-<name>.md` under `## Log` heading  
3. **Testing & Finalization**: Document final design in `/notes/features/<number>-<name>.md` under `## Conclusion` heading

### Bug Fix Workflow:

1. **Issue Documentation**: Document in `/notes/fixes/<number>-<name>.md` under `## Issue` heading
2. **Fix Implementation**: Store technical details in `/notes/fixes/<number>-<name>.md` under `## Fix` heading
3. **Resolution Summary**: Document learnings in `/notes/fixes/<number>-<name>.md` under `## Conclusion` heading

### AI Assistant Development Rules:

- **Always plan first**: Refuse to implement until plan is created and reviewed
- **Use existing infrastructure**: Leverage LLM coordination, context management, event sourcing
- **Follow OTP patterns**: Maintain supervision tree and distributed architecture
- **Comprehensive testing**: Test AI functionality, performance, and integration
- **Never commit without approval**: Wait for explicit commit instructions

**IMPORTANT**: For Phase 6 AI assistant work, always integrate with existing `LLM.ModelCoordinator`, `Context.Manager`, and `InterfaceGateway`.


## Phase 6: AI Assistant Development Guidelines

When implementing AI engines for the core assistant functionality:

### Integration with Existing Infrastructure:
- **Use `LLM.ModelCoordinator`**: For distributed AI processing across nodes with circuit breakers
- **Leverage `Context.Manager`**: For project understanding and session-aware context
- **Integrate with Event Sourcing**: Track all AI interactions for audit and learning
- **Follow Supervision Tree Patterns**: Maintain fault tolerance and process isolation
- **Use `InterfaceGateway`**: Route AI requests through existing unified interface

### AI Engine Development Patterns:
```elixir
# Example AI engine structure
defmodule Aiex.AI.CodeAnalyzer do
  use GenServer
  
  # Integrate with existing LLM coordination
  def analyze_code(file_path, options \\ []) do
    context = Context.Manager.get_project_context()
    LLM.ModelCoordinator.request(%{
      type: :code_analysis,
      content: file_content,
      context: context,
      options: options
    })
  end
end
```

### Prompt Template Development:
- Create structured, reusable prompt templates
- Include context injection points for project-specific information
- Support multiple detail levels (brief, detailed, tutorial)
- Implement template validation and testing

### Testing AI Functionality:
- Test AI engine logic separately from LLM responses
- Mock LLM responses for consistent testing
- Test integration with existing distributed infrastructure
- Include performance and memory usage tests
- Test error handling and graceful degradation

## High-Level Architecture

The architecture follows a distributed OTP design with six main subsystems:

1. **AI Assistant Engines** - Core logic for analysis, generation, explanation, refactoring (Phase 6 focus)
2. **Multi-Interface Layer** - CLI, TUI, Mix tasks, future LiveView with unified business logic
3. **LLM Integration Layer** - 4 providers with intelligent coordination and circuit breakers
4. **Context Management Engine** - Semantic chunking, compression, distributed synchronization
5. **File Operation Sandbox** - Security-focused operations with path validation and audit logging
6. **Event Sourcing System** - Distributed event bus with Mnesia persistence for auditability

Key architectural principles:
- **Distributed-first design**: Pure OTP with pg coordination for horizontal scaling
- **Actor model**: GenServers for stateful components with supervision trees
- **Interface abstraction**: Core business logic separated from presentation layer
- **Fault tolerance**: Circuit breakers, health monitoring, graceful degradation
- **Event-driven**: All state changes flow through event sourcing system

## Git Commit Guidelines

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: NEVER allow any AI tool to take authorship or co-authorship in commit messages or merge messages. This is a strict project policy.

**PROHIBITED in ALL commits and merges**:
- "Generated with Claude Code" or any AI tool attribution
- "Co-Authored-By: Claude" or any AI assistant credits  
- "🤖 Generated with [AI Tool]" or similar AI attribution
- Any mention of AI assistance, AI tools, or AI collaboration in commit descriptions
- Any form of AI authorship claim or credit

**REQUIRED**: All commits and merges must reflect human authorship only. Keep commit messages focused on the technical changes and their purpose, without referencing any tools or assistants used to create them.

**Why this matters**: This project maintains human authorship integrity and avoids any implication that AI tools are co-authors or contributors to the codebase.

## README.md Implementation Progress Formatting

When updating the "Implementation Progress" section in README.md, use this specific format:

### Phase Structure:
Each phase should include:
1. **Phase title** with weeks and completion status (e.g., "✅ 100% Complete", "⏳ 20%", or "⏳")
2. **Phase description paragraph** copied from the corresponding phase in `planning/detailed_implementation_plan.md`
3. **Section bullet list** with numbered sections:
   - Use `✅` for completed sections
   - Use `[ ]` (unchecked markdown checkbox) for uncompleted sections
   - Format: `- ✅ **Section X.Y:** Section Name` or `- [ ] **Section X.Y:** Section Name`

### Example Format for Current State:
```markdown
### Phase 5: Advanced Chat-Focused TUI Interface (Weeks 15-17) ✅ 100% Complete
