# OpenPi Project Rules

**Purpose:** Project-level operating rules for building OpenPi: a desktop workbench for the Pi coding agent (`@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` v0.74.0+).
**Audience:** human developers and AI coding agents.
**Source references:** earendil-works/pi main repo (https://github.com/earendil-works/pi), especially `packages/coding-agent/docs/` (sdk.md, rpc.md, session-format.md, extensions.md) and `packages/agent/README.md`.

---

## Product Direction

OpenPi is a desktop workbench for the Pi coding agent. It wraps Pi's session tree, agent events, extensions, skills, and customizations in an Electron + SolidJS UI — not a terminal emulator clone, not a VS Code replacement.

Target UX: sessions sidebar (workspace-grouped, token/cost badges, filter/sort popover) + agent conversation (model selector, tool cards, queue controls) + customizations panel (modal with AI wizard, Extensions/Skills/Prompts/Themes/Packages) + persistent Git source control panel (Changes/Files tabs, commit workflow) + split-pane diff viewer + bottom terminal panel (Output tab + Terminal tab) + OpenCode-style command palette for commands, files, and sessions.

---

## Recommended Stack

| Layer | Choice |
|---|---|
| Shell | Electron + electron-vite + electron-builder |
| Renderer | SolidJS + TypeScript + Vite |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS + Kobalte/Radix-style primitives + Lucide Icons |
| State | Solid signals/memos plus Electron-main read models |
| Validation | Zod at every IPC/JSON boundary |
| Terminal | xterm.js + node-pty in Electron main |
| Diff renderer | @pierre/diffs (replaceable renderer only) |
| Pi integration | @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent SDK (imported in Electron main) |
| Persistence | SQLite via better-sqlite3 in Electron main |
| Secrets | OS keychain via Electron safeStorage |

---

## Current Beta Surface

Implemented slices currently include:
- Secure Electron main/preload boundary with typed IPC schemas and renderer-only UI authority.
- Pi session host integration with streaming conversation, model controls, steering/follow-up queue visibility, abort, fork, and session rename flows.
- Workspace/session sidebar with recent workspace restore, session search/sort/group controls, pinned/archive affordances, workspace hero metadata, and Git branch/last-modified summary.
- Customizations modal for Extensions, Skills, Prompts, Themes, Packages, Settings, General preferences, and Keybindings, including the `⇧⌘P` Command Palette binding.
- OpenCode-style command palette (`⇧⌘P`) searching commands, workspace files via `fff`, and historical sessions.
- Main-owned Git source control panel, file tree/search, file viewer, and split diff viewer; renderer never runs Git directly.
- Bottom terminal/output panel backed by main-owned PTY lifecycle.
- Dynamic app metadata exposed from Electron main for Welcome/customizations branding, OpenPi runtime icons, and tag-triggered beta CI/release workflows.

## Pi Integration Path

### SDK is primary (Pi's own recommendation for Node.js)

```typescript
// Electron main process
import {
  createAgentSession,
  SessionManager,
  AuthStorage,
  ModelRegistry,
  DefaultResourceLoader,
} from "@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent";

const { session } = await createAgentSession({
  cwd: workspacePath,
  sessionManager: SessionManager.create(workspacePath),
  authStorage: AuthStorage.create(),
  modelRegistry: ModelRegistry.create(authStorage),
});

session.subscribe((event: AgentSessionEvent) => {
  // Forward to renderer via IPC
  mainWindow.webContents.send("pi:event", event);
});

await session.prompt(text);
```

### RPC subprocess — only when process isolation is explicitly required

Pi's `--mode rpc` (strict JSONL over stdin/stdout) is the right choice when:
- process-level isolation is required (security constraint or separate process budget)
- integrating from a non-Node language

For OpenPi, start with SDK in Electron main. Switch to RPC subprocess only when a concrete reason requires it.

**RPC framing note:** Split records on `\n` only. Do not use Node `readline` — it also splits on Unicode separators inside JSON.

### Session replacement API

For new session, resume, fork, and clone flows, use `AgentSessionRuntime` — not `AgentSession` directly:

```typescript
import { createAgentSessionRuntime, createAgentSessionServices, createAgentSessionFromServices } from "@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent";

const runtime = await createAgentSessionRuntime(
  async ({ cwd, sessionManager, sessionStartEvent }) => {
    const services = await createAgentSessionServices({ cwd });
    return { ...await createAgentSessionFromServices({ services, sessionManager, sessionStartEvent }), services, diagnostics: services.diagnostics };
  },
  { cwd, agentDir: getAgentDir(), sessionManager: SessionManager.create(cwd) }
);

await runtime.newSession();   // replaces active session
await runtime.switchSession(path);
await runtime.fork(entryId);  // creates new session file
```

Re-subscribe to `AgentSessionEvent` after every session replacement — subscriptions attach to a specific `AgentSession` instance.

---

## Process Model and Authority

### Renderer is not authority

Exists to render state and collect user intent only.

Must not directly:
- access the filesystem
- execute shell commands
- spawn processes
- apply patches or Git mutations
- read/write SQLite
- read secrets
- import Pi internals

### Electron main owns desktop authority

Electron main owns:
- app/window lifecycle and native menus/dialogs
- secure IPC routing and sender validation
- Pi SDK session host (creates, supervises, destroys AgentSession instances)
- PTY lifecycle via node-pty
- permission gate orchestration (before any mutation-capable action)
- Git authority: read (status, diff), stage (add specific files), commit, push, revert, checkout — all owned exclusively by Electron main via `simple-git` or child_process. Never via Pi tools, Pi SDK, or renderer code.
- SQLite read-model for workspaces, sessions index, blocks, preferences
- secret storage via safeStorage

### Pi SDK owns agent semantics

The Pi SDK (`@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent`) owns:
- model/provider behavior and model registry
- tool execution (read, bash, edit, write, grep, find, ls)
- session tree (JSONL v3 format, parentId-based branching)
- compaction (automatic and manual)
- extensions, skills, prompt templates, themes
- Pi packages (npm/git)
- message queue semantics (steering, follow-up)
- `AgentSessionEvent` stream

OpenPi does not reimplement any of this. It observes events and commands the SDK.

---

## Pi Concepts You Must Understand

### Session format (JSONL v3 tree)

Sessions are stored as JSONL files at `~/.pi/agent/sessions/<path-slug>_<name>.jsonl`.

Every line is a `SessionEntry` with `type`, `id` (8-char hex), `parentId` (null for root), `timestamp` (ISO).

Entry types:
- `session` — file header (no id/parentId); has `version`, `id` (UUID), `cwd`
- `message` — `AgentMessage` payload (user, assistant, toolResult, bashExecution, custom, branchSummary, compactionSummary)
- `model_change` — provider + modelId
- `thinking_level_change` — thinkingLevel
- `compaction` — summary + firstKeptEntryId + tokensBefore
- `branch_summary` — fromId + summary
- `custom` — extension state persistence (NOT in LLM context)
- `custom_message` — extension-injected LLM context message
- `label` — user-defined bookmark on targetId
- `session_info` — display name set via `/name` or `setSessionName()`

Tree structure: each entry points to its parent via `parentId`. Branching creates new children from an earlier entry. The "leaf" is current position. `SessionManager` API: `getTree()`, `getBranch()`, `getLeafId()`, `getEntry(id)`, `getChildren(id)`, `getLabel(id)`.

**Do not flatten sessions into a chat log.** Preserve the tree.

### Message queue semantics

Pi processes messages in a queue with two delivery modes:
- **Steer** (`session.steer()` / `steer` RPC): delivered after current assistant turn finishes its tool calls, before the next LLM call
- **Follow-up** (`session.followUp()` / `follow_up` RPC): delivered only when agent fully stops (no pending tool calls)
- **Abort** (`session.abort()`): cancels current run; pending queue messages return to input

`queue_update` events stream the current pending steering/followUp arrays. Surface them visibly in the UI.

### AgentSessionEvent stream

Core events to drive the UI:
| Event | UI use |
|---|---|
| `agent_start` | show active indicator |
| `agent_end` | clear active indicator, show token/cost summary |
| `turn_start` / `turn_end` | track per-turn usage (turn_end has message + toolResults) |
| `message_start` / `message_end` | open/close message bubbles |
| `message_update` with `assistantMessageEvent` | stream text_delta, thinking_delta, toolcall_delta |
| `tool_execution_start` | open tool card with name + args |
| `tool_execution_update` | update tool card with streaming output |
| `tool_execution_end` | close tool card with result / error |
| `queue_update` | update pending message chips |
| `compaction_start` / `compaction_end` | show compaction status entry |
| `auto_retry_start` / `auto_retry_end` | show retry status with attempt count |
| `extension_error` | surface extension failure visibly |

### What Pi does NOT have built-in

Pi intentionally ships without: sub-agents, MCP, permission gates, plan mode, background bash. All are buildable via extensions. OpenPi must not assume these exist or fake them at the Pi layer. If OpenPi needs permission gates, it implements them at the Electron main boundary — not by pretending Pi has them.

### Extensions

TypeScript modules with **full system permissions**. They execute arbitrary code, call any Node API, and make network requests. Pi's extension API: `ExtensionAPI` with `registerTool`, `registerCommand`, `registerShortcut`, `on(event, handler)`, `sendMessage`, `appendEntry`, `setActiveTools`, `registerProvider`, etc.

Security obligations:
- Show provenance (path, scope, package origin) before enabling
- Require workspace trust for project-local extensions
- Never silently install or execute third-party packages
- Extensions must run through Pi SDK, not be loaded directly by the renderer
- Never pass extension factory functions across the IPC boundary

### Customizations (correct Pi terminology)

| OpenPi UI | Pi concept | Discovery |
|---|---|---|
| Extensions | Extensions (.ts files) | `~/.pi/agent/extensions/`, `.pi/extensions/` |
| Skills | Skills (SKILL.md dirs) | `~/.pi/agent/skills/`, `.pi/skills/`, ancestor dirs |
| Prompts | Prompt Templates (.md) | `~/.pi/agent/prompts/`, `.pi/prompts/` |
| Themes | Themes | `~/.pi/agent/themes/`, `.pi/themes/` |
| Packages | Pi Packages (npm/git) | `settings.json` packages array |

Do not use OpenCode/Copilot terminology ("Instructions", "Hooks", "Plugins", "Agents" count) for Pi resources. Use Pi's actual names.

### Context files

Pi loads `AGENTS.md` (or `CLAUDE.md`) walking up from cwd plus `~/.pi/agent/AGENTS.md`. They concatenate. Keep project-local AGENTS.md concise and operational. Project `.pi/SYSTEM.md` replaces the default system prompt; `.pi/APPEND_SYSTEM.md` appends to it.

### Settings

Two scopes: `~/.pi/agent/settings.json` (global) and `.pi/settings.json` (project, overrides global). Key settings: `compaction.enabled`, `retry.enabled`, `steeringMode`, `followUpMode`, `transport`, `packages`, `extensions`. Use `SettingsManager.create(cwd)` for SDK access.

---

## Electron Security Rules

Mandatory defaults — not optional:

- `contextIsolation: true`
- `nodeIntegration: false` in renderer
- `sandbox: true` where practical
- preload exposes only an explicit, typed, Zod-validated API surface
- validate IPC sender (frame origin) for every privileged handler
- strict Content Security Policy
- no remote content by default
- no renderer access to raw Node built-ins
- sandbox exceptions must be documented and scope-limited

---

## Non-Negotiable Product Boundaries

### Renderer is render-only

Never add filesystem, shell, process, patch, SQLite, secret, or Git logic to renderer code. If it requires a Node built-in, it belongs in Electron main.

### Diff viewer and Git source control panel

The right panel is a **persistent live git source control panel** (always visible, not just after agent runs):
- File-level changes with `+N -N` line counts and M/A/D status badges
- Branch total delta in header
- Commit workflow (stage + commit message + commit button) — all mutations in Electron main
- `simple-git` or direct `child_process` for all git commands in Electron main

`@pierre/diffs` renders the split-pane diff viewer (side-by-side old/new, syntax-highlighted, N of M file navigation). Electron main computes diffs and applies/rejects hunks. The diff viewer collects intent; Electron main executes it.

**Critical:** Commit workflow must never use `git add .` or `git add -A`. Always pass specific file paths.

### Customizations panel is a modal with an AI wizard

The customizations panel opens as a full modal/overlay with:
- Sidebar nav: Extensions, Skills, Prompts, Themes, Packages (count badges)
- Model selector at the top of the panel
- **AI generation wizard**: user describes preferences in natural language → OpenPi sends as a structured Pi session prompt → agent writes resource files into the correct Pi directories
- Per-resource management with `New…` scaffold actions and `Browse…` for packages

The AI wizard does NOT call any file-writing API directly from the renderer or Electron main. It prompts the active Pi session which uses Pi's own tools (write, edit) to create the files. OpenPi then triggers a resource reload.

Show provenance before enabling. Require workspace trust for project-local extensions. Never silently install. Extensions run through Pi SDK in Electron main — they are never loaded in the renderer.

### Pi SDK owns session semantics

Never reimplement session tree, compaction, message queuing, or tool execution in OpenPi. These belong to Pi. OpenPi observes and presents.

---

## Development Principles

1. **SDK before reimplementation.** If Pi SDK can do it, use it. Read the SDK docs before writing custom logic.
2. **Small verified slices.** Build one vertical slice (renderer → IPC → main → Pi SDK) at a time. Verify before expanding.
3. **Boundary-first type safety.** Zod at every IPC payload. TypeScript at every contract.
4. **Preserve session tree semantics.** Never flatten JSONL trees into plain message arrays for persistence.
5. **Permission before mutation.** Any action that writes files, applies patches, mutates Git state, executes shell commands, or runs extensions needs explicit policy in Electron main before execution.
6. **No speculative work.** Build macOS first. Add platforms after core stability. No cloud, marketplace, or collaboration until local workflows are excellent.

---

## Verification Expectations

Before claiming completion on any slice:

- `npm run typecheck` — zero errors
- `npm run lint` — zero warnings
- Run targeted tests for the changed surface
- Electron smoke launch when changing main/preload
- If you create or modify a test file, run it and iterate until it passes
- For IPC changes: verify Zod schemas parse correctly in both directions

---

## Release and Changelog Rules

Before tagging, pushing, or claiming any version release:

1. Run `git log --oneline <previous-version-tag>..HEAD` and inspect every commit included in the release.
2. Update `CHANGELOG.md` for the version with concrete, user-facing release notes grouped under headings such as `Added`, `Fixed`, and `Changed`.
3. Mention relevant implementation/ops changes when they affect users or maintainers: CI, packaging, updater behavior, Git/workspace behavior, file attachments, Pi package loading, docs, and beta caveats.
4. Never leave a placeholder-only entry such as `Release OpenPi vX.Y.Z.` for a released version.
5. Verify the packaged changelog path when release UI changes: `CHANGELOG.md` must be included in `electron-builder.json` `extraResources` and readable by the app's What's New modal.
6. If release automation creates a placeholder entry, edit it into full notes before creating or pushing the tag.

---

## Editing Rules

1. Read relevant files before editing.
2. Keep diffs surgical — one concern per PR.
3. Prefer existing patterns over new abstractions.
4. Do not add dependencies without a clear reason; get user approval for dependencies that change project direction.
5. Define one owner per concept — renderer/main/Pi SDK ownership lines are the primary constraint.
6. Run verification before claiming completion.
7. Do not duplicate Pi SDK functionality in OpenPi. Check the SDK first.

---

## What Not To Do

- Do not flatten Pi session trees into plain chat history.
- Do not let renderer code be the patch, secret, or Git authority.
- Do not import `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` in the renderer.
- Do not implement permission gates at the Pi SDK layer — do it at the Electron main IPC boundary.
- Do not silently install or enable third-party Pi packages.
- Do not build a subprocess RPC client before proving SDK in main is insufficient.
- Do not rewrite Pi's agent runtime, session manager, or tool execution.
- Do not fork Warp or OpenWarp as the app base.
- Do not ship `nodeIntegration: true` or disable `contextIsolation` as a convenience shortcut.
- Do not use OpenCode/Copilot terminology for Pi's resources (Instructions → Prompts, Agents → Extensions, Hooks → Extension events, Plugins → Packages).
