> - `ytmusicfs` is a Python FUSE filesystem for browsing and streaming YouTube Music as local files.

# Repository Guidelines

## Project Overview

- `ytmusicfs` is a Python FUSE filesystem for browsing and streaming YouTube Music as local files.
- It captures YouTube Music browser auth, reads library data through `ytmusicapi`, and streams audio through `yt-dlp`.
- Keep behavior practical for media players: stable paths, predictable metadata, cached listings, and graceful failures.

## Approach

- Read before editing. Test before declaring done.
- Prefer small edits over rewrites.
- Reproduce before fixing runtime or external issues.
- Unproven concerns are risks, not bugs. Say so if not reproduced.
- Use the simplest working solution. No over-engineering, speculative features, or single-use abstractions.

## Output

- Code first. Explain only non-obvious logic.
- No filler, boilerplate, or out-of-scope suggestions.
- Use plain hyphens and straight quotes only. No decorative Unicode. Keep code output copy-paste safe.

## Coding Style & Naming

- Python 3.10+ project; prefer type hints and explicit return types.
- Formatter: Black, line length 88.
- Imports: Ruff import sorting (`I` rules), formatted with Black.
- Indentation: 4 spaces.
- Names: modules/functions `snake_case`, classes `PascalCase`, constants `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`.
- Use `logging` instead of prints. Follow `ytmusicfs/cli.py` logging setup.
- Keep functions focused. Prefer small component-level changes over cross-cutting rewrites.
- Remove unused imports, variables, parameters, dead branches, and dead functions from edited files.
- Do not add error handling for impossible scenarios.
- Keep all imports at the top of the file. Use local imports only when strictly required to break circular dependencies.
- Code and comments must be in English. User-facing strings stay in their existing language.
- Remove old code when introducing replacements. Do not add backward compatibility shims without explicit authorization.
- Do not preserve feature flags for shipped features or abstractions that serve a single caller.

## Architecture Notes

- Components communicate through narrow interfaces; avoid reaching into another component's internals.
- `YouTubeMusicFS` coordinates routing, metadata, content fetches, cache, and file handling.
- Cache is shared for consistency across directory listings, file attributes, metadata, and path validation.
- Caching is multi-tier: in-memory hot data plus SQLite persistence.
- External dependencies (`ytmusicapi`, `yt-dlp`, browser cookies, network calls) should be mocked in unit tests.
- FUSE-facing errors must map cleanly to errno-style failures where appropriate.
- Prefer graceful degradation when YouTube Music, auth, or stream extraction is unavailable.

## Common Development Tasks

- Adding filesystem paths:
  1. Register the route in `filesystem.py`.
  2. Add fetch/transform logic in `content_fetcher.py` or `processor.py` as needed.
  3. Update path validation in `path_router.py`.
  4. Add tests in `tests/`.
- Extending API support:
  1. Add wrapper methods in `client.py`.
  2. Process returned data in `content_fetcher.py`.
  3. Normalize metadata and filenames in `processor.py`.
- Repairing unavailable liked songs:
  1. Normal filesystem browsing may repair local liked-song cache entries, but must not mutate account likes.
  2. Keep account mutations explicit and interactive through `ytmusicfs repair`.
  3. Verify replacement streams before calling `rate_song`.
  4. Show planned old ID -> replacement ID changes before calling `rate_song`.
  5. Like the replacement before unliking the unavailable ID.
  6. Skip weak matches; do not mutate account state on uncertain results.
- Performance work:
  - Reduce API calls first.
  - Use batch cache operations where available.
  - Preserve cache invalidation rules and timestamps.
  - Mount may schedule background refresh work for expensive content such as liked songs; do not block mount on large library refreshes unless explicitly requested.

## Debugging

- Read code before explaining.
- Prove findings with direct evidence: failing test, reproduced run, or concrete probe.
- State what you found, where, and the fix.
- If unclear, say so.
- For runtime or external failures, reproduce first when possible.

## Verification

- Smallest proof first, then broader checks.
- Use the standard toolchain.
- Default checks: format, lint with warnings as errors, and tests.
- Skip a check only with a stated reason.
- Do not claim fixed, safe, ready, or done without fresh command output.
- Fix every issue encountered. Do not ignore failures as pre-existing.

## Testing Guidelines

- Framework: Pytest.
- Discovery: files `test_*.py`, classes `Test*`, functions `test_*`.
- Add tests alongside the changed behavior in `tests/`.
- Cover critical paths: filesystem operations, path routing, cache updates, downloader behavior, auth failure modes.
- For bug fixes, include a regression test when the failure can be reproduced without live YouTube Music access.
- If the project has tests, run them before committing or declaring work complete. No exceptions.
- A failing test is blocking. Fix it before moving on.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

- Commits: imperative, concise, scoped to one change.
- Example: `Refactor logging setup in cli.py`
- Reference issues when relevant, e.g. `Fixes #123`.
- PRs must include purpose/scope, test commands and results, risk notes, and logs/screenshots for CLI or mount behavior changes.
- CI should pass formatting, lint, and tests before merge.
- Ask before pushing every time, even if previously approved.
- No batch commit and push.
- No force push or hard reset without approval.
- Never use `git commit --amend` unless explicitly asked.
- Merge to `main` with a single squashed commit.
- Commit messages must be in English.

## Security & Configuration

- Never commit credentials, browser cookies, or local auth captures.
- Cache: `~/.cache/ytmusicfs`.
- Saved mount defaults: `~/.config/ytmusicfs/config.json`.
- Active mount state: `~/.cache/ytmusicfs/mount.json`.
- Logs: `~/.cache/ytmusicfs/logs`.
- Use `--foreground` and `--debug` when diagnosing mount issues.
- Environment variables are only for secrets and external credentials.
- Prefer sane defaults, zero-config behavior, and easy maintenance.
- Hardcode sensible defaults for internal URLs, ports, and feature flags.
- When adding a dependency, verify the actual latest version from the registry or official source. Never rely on model memory.
