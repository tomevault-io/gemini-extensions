# Nika Core autonomous development instructions

This repository is the canonical source of truth. Chat history is not.

Before every coding cycle read: `docs/MASTER_SPEC.md`, `docs/FULL_PRODUCT_VISION_2026-08-19.md`, `docs/AUTONOMOUS_PRODUCT_FACTORY.md`, `docs/AUTONOMOUS_PRODUCT_FACTORY_ACCEPTANCE.md`, `docs/AUTONOMOUS_BUSINESS_FACTORY.md`, `docs/ROADMAP.md`, `docs/THIRD_PARTY_ADOPTION.md`, `docs/REUSE_CATALOG_2026-08-18.md`, `docs/INTELLIGENCE_REUSE_2026-08-19.md`, `docs/WORKSPACE_REUSE_CATALOG_2026-08-18.md`, `docs/WORKSPACE_REUSE_CATALOG_2026-08-19.md`, `docs/UI_ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/LARGE_BATCH_POLICY.md`, `docs/PARALLEL_DEVELOPMENT_POLICY.md`, `docs/AUTONOMOUS_DEVELOPMENT_PROTOCOL.md`, `docs/ACCEPTANCE_GATES.md`, `state/PROJECT_STATUS.md`, `state/PARALLEL_EXECUTION_BOARD.md`, LIVE DASHBOARD, open PRs and current CI.

Primary rule: **REUSE BEFORE REWRITE**. Search maintained upstream libraries and current official documentation before implementing a subsystem. Default decision order is **REUSE -> ADAPT -> CUSTOM (thin)**. A CUSTOM decision is invalid unless it records why maintained upstream options do not satisfy the requirement. Do not copy random or wholesale third-party source into this repository when a package dependency/adapter is sufficient. Do not add broad unused dependencies merely “for later”; graduate a candidate through a focused proof, exact license/version check and tests.

Architecture: Windows-first modular monolith with ports/adapters and versioned contracts. Nika owns task/audit/permission/product contracts; provider-neutral Model Gateway; workspace/plugin boundaries; ProductProject and ProductRepositoryGraph contracts; Deterministic Brain contracts; deterministic state/validation/dedup/safety; and the Product Journey/Product Factory gates. Language models are replaceable capabilities, not the platform kernel. Agent orchestration sits behind `AgentRuntimePort`; third-party framework/model/planner/coding-worker types must not leak into Nika domain APIs.

Intelligence truth: Nika has four distinct paths that must not be conflated: (1) model-free Deterministic Brain, (2) embedded local model with Microsoft Foundry Local as primary Windows adapter and measured alternatives such as llama.cpp/ONNX Runtime GenAI, (3) external local model servers such as Ollama, and (4) allowed cloud/API providers. Installing or testing one does not award evidence for the others.

Runtime truth: M2 selected and integrated LangGraph behind `AgentRuntimePort`. Microsoft Agent Framework remains a secondary migration/interop candidate. Do not run multiple competing orchestration kernels in production unless a new measured proof demonstrates a concrete requirement.

Full-product truth: historical Core percentages do not equal completion of the expanded Full Product Vision. A backend subsystem is not finished until its actual packaged Windows user journey is connected and proven. Telegram is removed from active roadmap scope; old Telegram references in historical reuse documents are non-binding unless a future explicit user request reintroduces such a workspace/ProductProject.

Autonomous Product Factory truth: **build the factory, not every possible product**. Do not interpret examples such as a messenger, social network, screen-reader-like product, browser-agent platform or business application as requirements to hard-code those products into Core. The requirement is a durable ProductProject lifecycle that can research, specify, compose a specialist team, create/connect one or more repositories, implement in isolation, independently review/test, package, deploy under policy and maintain the resulting product. A large ProductProject may run for days/weeks/months and must not depend on chat memory.

Product-vs-Toolsmith truth: Toolsmith closes a narrow missing capability for an existing task. Product Factory owns complete product/system goals. Do not force a large product request into one oversized CodingJob or claim Product Factory completion from a coding-worker demo.

Dynamic-team truth: team roles are derived from ProductProject scope, dependencies and risk. One worker may cover several roles for a small project; a large project may need independent research, product, architecture, security, backend, frontend, Windows/mobile, QA, accessibility, DevOps/release and support roles. Agent count is not a success metric. New specialization may be added during execution without widening the ProductProject permission ceiling.

Research-to-Product truth: Universal Research is the canonical evidence/research layer for Product Factory and Business Factory. Where the user requests discovery/market/competitor analysis, research evidence and user/policy decisions must become versioned ProductProject inputs without manual copy/paste. Do not create a second research engine for Product Factory.

Repository/deployment truth: Product Factory may own one repository or a multi-repository ProductRepositoryGraph. Source generation is not product completion. Build/package, approved staging/deployment, health proof, rollback and maintenance are part of the product lifecycle where applicable. Use provider-neutral adapters and execution nodes; do not assume the local Windows laptop can build every platform target.

Credential truth: never put persistent passwords/API keys/OAuth material into prompts, model memory, Git, ProductProject state or ordinary logs. Product/workspace/business connectors use Credential/Identity Broker references and least-privilege scoped/short-lived credentials where supported. Workers cannot enumerate unrelated credentials.

Business Factory truth: Business Agent Lab is an optional reusable orchestration layer, not a hard-coded freelancer bot or one niche. It may research opportunities, qualify user-approved work, create WorkOrders/ProductProjects, coordinate delivery and track support/payment state. External communication, accounts, contracts, publishing and money movement obey platform rules and Nika authorization. No spam, deceptive impersonation, prohibited automation or self-expansion of financial/account authority.

IP/license truth: public competitor/product/market research may inform an independent implementation, but access to proprietary source/assets/credentials is not permission to copy them. Every adopted dependency/tool records version/license/provenance and relevant distribution obligations; missing/unacceptable provenance can block release.

Parallel-first rule: every cycle selects the maximum set of genuinely independent large coherent lanes that can advance safely. Dependencies constrain merge/integration order, not isolated research, contract design, adapter implementation, mocks, fixtures, tests or prototypes. A blocked lane must not idle unrelated lanes. Avoid fake parallelism and shared-file collisions; prefer clear lane ownership and stable ports. Product Factory work additionally requires ownership by ProductProject/component/repository. Use PREPARED / IMPLEMENTED / GREEN / INTEGRATED / PACKAGED / HUMAN_TESTED / NVDA_VERIFIED evidence states accurately.

Large-batch rule: do not stop after one file, one function, one lint error or one small PR if the same coherent subsystem can safely be carried through implementation, error/recovery behavior, tests, docs, CI and integration in the same cycle.

Manual Deep Research development: when the user creates manual Deep Research developer/auditor chats, treat developer chats as real coding lanes capable of large implementation batches, not research-only roles. Their paired auditors independently inspect live GitHub evidence. Scheduled workers should then be paused or reassigned to complementary non-colliding QA/release/integration/evidence work rather than duplicating the same source ownership.

Accessibility: blind primary user, Windows 11 + NVDA. Web-style desktop UI uses local semantic HTML inside pywebview/WebView2; keyboard-only operation, accessible names/roles, headings/landmarks, deterministic focus and text logs are mandatory. Packaged WebView2 UI Automation discovery is a specific gate. Automated accessibility tests do not equal human NVDA verification. Products created by Product Factory receive relevant accessibility review/gates rather than inheriting false credit from Nika Core.

Hotkeys: every application command has a stable Action Registry ID and all application-specific shortcuts are user-remappable through the Keymap system. Do not scatter hard-coded shortcuts through UI code or break standard editing keys.

Safety: no secrets in repo; no token/session/browser profile files; dangerous send/delete/publish/financial/code-execution actions remain governed by preview/audit/approval. Runtime agents never self-modify production source directly or self-expand permissions. A Toolsmith/Software Factory capability proposal uses isolation + tests + compatibility/security gates before registration. Product Factory workers use the same isolation discipline and cannot promote failed candidates or deploy outside authorized scope. For persistent user credentials prefer OS-backed secret storage rather than plaintext configuration. Public-repository secret scanning is a permanent gate.

Git discipline: `main` must remain releasable. Use feature/fix branches and coherent commits. Independent lanes branch from the latest green main unless a real dependency requires otherwise. Never claim success without exact test evidence. Distinguish IMPLEMENTED, GREEN, INTEGRATED, PACKAGED, HUMAN_TESTED and NVDA_VERIFIED.

CI policy: coherent PR/main gates execute the shared verification harness on both Ubuntu and Windows. Focused Windows/WebView2/package/security/model-hardware/Product-Factory jobs may be added where they provide real evidence. Never weaken a check to obtain green. Stale runs for the same PR/ref may be canceled. Do not rebuild an EXE or download large models on every development push.

At the end of every cycle update canonical GitHub status with branch/SHA, changes, tests, blocker, Core-vs-Full-Product truth, Product-Factory/Business-Factory truth where relevant, parallel lane state changes and next large coherent work wave. User-facing reports should explain practical capabilities first; exact technical evidence remains available underneath.
