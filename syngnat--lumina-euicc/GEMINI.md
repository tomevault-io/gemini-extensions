## What this repository is

**Lumina eUICC** is a Flutter-first removable / programmable eUICC manager with
a modern Material 3 interface. It uses the vendored OpenEUICC/lpac LPA stack
behind a thin native bridge.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| GitHub | https://github.com/Syngnat/lumina-euicc (public) |
| Owner | Syngnat |
| App ID | `top.syngnat.lumina.euicc` |
| Display name | Lumina eUICC |
| Primary platforms | Android 9+ (API 28) and iOS 13+; Flutter UI |
| Not a goal | Managing **internal** phone eSIM without system privilege |

Non-root operation is a hard product constraint: never add Root/Magisk/Shizuku flows, system-app installation requirements, private iOS entitlements, or privileged telephony permissions. Android's supported in-phone path is OMAPI to a removable eUICC whose ARA-M authorizes at least one current Lumina APK signer; USB CCID is the alternative. iOS supports only an external USB CCID reader through CryptoTokenKit—ordinary apps cannot send APDUs to the iPhone SIM slot. Release APKs from `0.1.1` onward use one stable four-current-signer set (Lumina, Sakura, ShiinaSekiu Community, and 9eSIM). The three community identities are reproducible from pinned public source; the Lumina identity remains private and anchors Android update security.

### Product goal (user request)

- Existing removable-eUICC managers are useful but visually dated
- User wants **complete removable-card capability** with a **better UI**
- Prefer **not writing app logic in Java**; accepted architecture is **Flutter UI + thin Kotlin/Swift bridges + OpenEUICC/lpac LPA stack**
- User develops on **Windows**; this repo was scaffolded on a low-RAM VPS that **cannot** reliably build full Flutter/Android APKs

## What it is NOT

- Not a pure-Flutter eUICC stack (OMAPI/CryptoTokenKit/APDU access needs native platform code)
- Not a full privileged OpenEUICC system app for internal eSIM
- Not a web app
- Not finished end-to-end: one exact card/device combination has read-only ARA-M/profile-list evidence, but mutations, named-model coverage, and USB CCID still require real-device validation

## Architecture

```text
Flutter (Dart) — Material 3 UI
    MethodChannel: top.syngnat.lumina.euicc/bridge
    EventChannel:  top.syngnat.lumina.euicc/task_events
        ↓
Platform bridge
  Android: EuiccBridgePlugin.kt → OpenEUICC app-common + lpac-jni
  iOS:     EuiccBridgePlugin.swift → LpacSession + vendored lpac C
        ↓
Android OMAPI / USB CCID, or iOS CryptoTokenKit / USB CCID
```

### Key paths

| Path | Role |
|---|---|
| `lib/` | Flutter UI, models, providers, MethodChannel client |
| `lib/services/euicc_bridge.dart` | Dart API surface (what Flutter pages call) |
| `lib/pages/` | Home, download/QR, compatibility, settings |
| `android/app/.../EuiccBridgePlugin.kt` | Real LPA + read-only diagnostics; mock fallback is debug-only |
| `android/app/.../LuminaApplication.kt` | Hosts OpenEUICC `DefaultAppContainer` |
| `ios/Runner/EuiccBridgePlugin.swift` | iOS Method/EventChannel bridge and platform capability boundary |
| `ios/Runner/LpacSession.swift` | Swift facade over the vendored lpac C API |
| `ios/Runner/SmartCardTransport.swift` | CryptoTokenKit USB CCID/APDU transport; no iPhone SIM-slot access |
| `ios/Runner/Native/` | Objective-C-compatible C facade plus per-source lpac/cJSON compilation units |
| `third_party/OpenEUICC/` | Vendored upstream sources; preserve each component's license files |
| `docs/FEATURE_PARITY.md` | Native/API capability mapping; not proof of Flutter UI exposure |
| `docs/NATIVE_INTEGRATION.md` | Integration status & build notes |
| `docs/COMMUNITY_SIGNING.md` | Four-signer identity, ARA-M, migration, provenance, and update policy |
| `docs/SUPPORTED_CARDS.md` | Evidence-based card candidate matrix and USB limitations; not a hardware certification |
| `LICENSE` / `LICENSES_SCOPE.md` | GPL-3.0-only text and precise project/third-party license boundary |
| `NOTICE.md` / `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` | Copyright attribution and component-specific third-party terms |

## Unprivileged removable-eUICC capability

| Capability | Status in code |
|---|---|
| List channels (OMAPI / USB) | Android real path and iOS CryptoTokenKit USB path are implemented in source; Android debug-only mock and release unavailable states are explicit; one exact Android OMAPI combination opened ISD-R, while every USB path remains unvalidated |
| List profiles | UI/bridge path implemented; one exact, model-unknown 9eSIM-card/device combination listed real profiles with `0.1.1` |
| Enable / disable profile | UI/bridge path implemented; hardware validation pending |
| Delete / rename profile | UI/bridge path implemented; hardware validation pending |
| Keep-alive reminders | Android uses AlarmClock/AlarmManager; iOS uses UserNotifications. Neither path persists plaintext ICCID or writes reminder data to the eUICC |
| One-tap micro-data check | Foreground-only OMAPI path temporarily switches the target profile, requests its exact Android cellular subscription, performs one bodyless HTTPS request, releases the app-scoped network request, and restores the prior profile; it does not control global data, cannot bound carrier-billed bytes, and has no real-card validation |
| Download via LPA activation code / QR | UI/bridge path, progress events, and confirmation implemented; hardware validation pending |
| Compatibility check | Android reports OMAPI/ARA-M; iOS reports CryptoTokenKit and external CCID readers. Both are read-only source paths, not hardware certification |
| STK management | Android can open the system SIM Toolkit/card-side LPAe menu; iOS has no equivalent public launch contract and hides this entry |
| Reminder center / eUICC reports | Home bell lists local keep-alive reminders; Settings separately labels card-side pending reports; process/delete have native handlers but no Dart API or UI actions |
| Memory reset | UI/bridge path implemented; destructive hardware path not validated |
| Online update | Android keeps the verified immutable-Release APK updater. iOS hides the updater because an ordinary app cannot generically install a replacement IPA; developer-signed sideloading remains external |
| eUICC info (EID, etc.) | Dart/native API implemented; no dedicated Flutter presentation or hardware validation |
| Internal eSIM | **Out of scope** (needs privileged OpenEUICC) |

### Runtime modes

Android selects:

1. **`mode=real`**: at least one eUICC channel opened → ops use `channel.lpa.*`
2. **`mode=mock`**: debug build and no channel → in-memory development data
3. **`mode=unavailable`**: release build and no channel → empty real result; never show invented profiles

iOS returns **`mode=real`** only when CryptoTokenKit exposes at least one USB
smart-card slot, otherwise **`mode=unavailable`**. iOS never creates mock
profiles and never presents the built-in SIM slot as a channel.

Agents must **not** claim “real-card tested” unless logcat/device evidence exists,
and must state the exact card/device/operation scope. Current evidence is limited
to `0.1.1` opening ISD-R on OMAPI slot 1, discovering port 1/0, validating the
LPA channel, and listing profiles on one seller-described 9eSIM card. Its exact
card model, phone model, and Android version were not recorded. Another card
from the same retailer was rejected by ARA-M; no mutation or USB operation is
validated, and no 9eSIM family or retailer is certified. The denied card was
retested with `0.1.2` on OPPO PME110 / OP61C1L1, Android 16 / API 36: OMAPI
enumerated both SIM slots and the SIM 0 probe reached the ISD-R access check
before access control denied the current app identity. This is card/application
authorization evidence, not evidence of a locked OPPO channel.

## MethodChannel contract (summary)

Channel name: `top.syngnat.lumina.euicc/bridge`  
Events: `top.syngnat.lumina.euicc/task_events`

Methods (see `lib/services/euicc_bridge.dart` plus both native bridge files):

- `listChannels` → `{channels:[{slotId,portId,seId,label,type,...}], mode}`
- `getPlatformCapabilities` gates Android-only STK/micro-data/exact-alarm/update UI and fails closed on unknown platforms
- `listProfiles` / `switchProfile` / `deleteProfile` / `renameProfile`
- `requestPhoneStatePermission` / `runMicroDataKeepAlive` for the explicit, app-scoped cellular check; success means only that the HTTPS request completed, not that a carrier extended validity
- `downloadProfile` returns a `taskId`; every EventChannel event and each confirm/cancel call carries that ID to prevent cross-task delivery
- `runCompatibilityCheck` / `getEuiccInfo` / `memoryReset`
- `getAppRuntimeInfo` / `prepareUpdateFile` / `verifyAndInstallUpdate` / `openInstallPermissionSettings` for user-confirmed official Release updates
- `openSimToolkit` launches the system SIM Toolkit/card-side LPAe menu; it returns only whether a system activity was launched
- Dart-visible notification method: `listNotifications`
- Native handlers without Dart/UI exposure: `processNotification` / `deleteNotification`

On iOS, `requestPhoneStatePermission`, `runMicroDataKeepAlive`,
`openSimToolkit`, `openExactAlarmSettings`, and the APK update UI are explicitly
unsupported. See `docs/IOS_INTEGRATION.md` for build/signing and validation.

Activation codes: `LPA:1$smdp.example.com$matchingId...` (parsed like OpenEUICC `LPAString`).

## License constraints (critical)

- Lumina-owned portions are Copyright (C) 2026 Syngnat and licensed
  GPL-3.0-only under the root `LICENSE`; `LICENSES_SCOPE.md` defines the exact
  boundary.
- `third_party/OpenEUICC/LICENSE` applies GPL-3.0-only terms to OpenEUICC.
- lpac-jni and cJSON retain different licenses in their bundled license files; do not label every vendored component GPL-3.0-only.
- A GitHub Release custom-uploads only the four APK variants. It must be tied to
  an immutable version tag whose GitHub-generated source archives contain the
  exact tracked project/vendor source and legal files. Release notes must link
  that tag tree and the tag-pinned license/notices. The same trusted CI run must
  still produce and verify the complete exact-commit source,
  dependency-source/manifests, `SOURCE_INFO.txt`, dependency inventories,
  checksums, and root/nested license bundle. Retain the complete build bundle as
  one 90-day Actions audit artifact, and publish every non-APK item together in
  one versioned source-materials ZIP on the dedicated `release-materials`
  branch. Release notes must link that ZIP through its exact materials commit
  and state its SHA-256. Do not redistribute an APK without a clear link to its
  matching immutable tag, persistent materials ZIP, and legal notices.
- The exact upstream OpenEUICC revision was not retained separately. The
  authoritative source is the tracked `third_party/OpenEUICC` snapshot in the
  full Lumina commit recorded by `SOURCE_INFO.txt`; never invent an upstream
  commit identifier.
- Do **not** strip `NOTICE.md`, `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`,
  `LICENSES_SCOPE.md`, or upstream license files.
- Community-signing provenance and the upstream MIT notice must remain in
  `docs/COMMUNITY_SIGNING.md` and `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`. Never commit or
  package a keystore, private key, or password, including publicly reproducible
  community material.

## Build

### Android (Windows or CI)

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/Syngnat/lumina-euicc.git
cd lumina-euicc
flutter pub get
flutter analyze --no-pub
flutter test --no-pub
flutter build apk --debug --no-pub
```

Requirements:

- Flutter **3.44.9**
- JDK 17
- Android SDK platforms 35 and 36, plus Build Tools 34.0.0 and 35.0.0
- NDK **28.2.13676358** for the app and transitive pub package `jni` 1.0.3 through Flutter's `flutter.ndkVersion`
- NDK **26.1.10909125** for vendored OpenEUICC `lpac-jni`
- CMake 3.22.1 for `jni` 1.0.3's `externalNativeBuild.cmake` path
- Checked-in Gradle 8.9 wrapper

OpenEUICC `lpac-jni` uses `externalNativeBuild.ndkBuild`; pub package `jni` 1.0.3 separately uses `externalNativeBuild.cmake`. The Lumina app compiles against SDK 36 and targets SDK 35; vendored `app-common` and `lpac-jni` compile against SDK 35. Keep both SDK platforms, both Build Tools versions, both NDKs, and CMake in CI unless those locked dependencies change.

Verified on Windows on 2026-08-08 after the legal-screen/native-ZXing changes: `flutter analyze --no-pub` reported no issues, all 21 Flutter tests passed, all 32 Kotlin/JUnit tests passed, and a dedicated-key `:app:assembleRelease` completed successfully. `apksigner` verified that historical single-signer baseline with v2 signing and certificate SHA-256 `1F:C1:52:76:70:A8:0B:2B:B5:A8:1F:FC:D2:D8:D7:82:C2:AD:00:3A:21:8F:2C:AD:42:9D:30:08:81:07:D8:9F`. Release ZIP alignment passed, and every 64-bit native ELF—including `liblpac-jni.so`—had `LOAD` alignment of at least `2**14`. The APK contained the three configured ABIs and both native build paths. This baseline predates community multi-signing and does not validate the new four-signer release chain. It is not real-card validation; consult GitHub Actions for the exact pushed-commit result. Flutter currently warns that Gradle 8.9, AGP 8.7.0, and Kotlin 2.0.21 are nearing its support floor.

GitHub Actions uses a `verify` job for pull requests/main/manual/version-tag runs and a separate `release` job only on trusted `main` or `v*` refs allowed by the `release-signing` Environment. Never move signing material into source, logs, PR jobs, artifacts, or the `contents: write` publishing job. CI builds universal, arm64-v8a, armeabi-v7a, and x86_64 APKs with v1/v3 disabled and must verify package/SDK/ABI metadata, APK Signature Scheme v2, disabled v3 signing, exactly four current signers with the fingerprints in `docs/COMMUNITY_SIGNING.md`, ZIP alignment, and every arm64-v8a/x86_64 ELF. A matching `v<version-name>` tag creates a GitHub Release with only those four custom-uploaded APK assets after the exact-commit source, hosted Pub sources, available Maven source JARs/POMs, exact Flutter framework/engine source references, source manifests, `SOURCE_INFO.txt`, checksums, dependency inventories, and nested license archive have been produced and verified in the same run. The secret-free `contents: write` publishing job also appends one complete non-APK source-materials ZIP under `v<version-name>/` on the pre-existing `release-materials` branch, records its exact commit and SHA-256 in the Release notes, and verifies that the published Release is immutable. GitHub's automatic tag source archives remain visible and cannot be hidden.

Any installed `0.1.0` APK with only the original Lumina signer must be
uninstalled once before the four-signer APK can be installed. Thereafter the
exact four-signer set is immutable for update compatibility. A certificate-only
ARA-M rule may match any current signer; a package-bound rule must also match
`top.syngnat.lumina.euicc`. Do not generalize the one limited physical-card
result beyond its recorded operation scope.

Use CI or a sufficiently provisioned Android host for native builds. A failed or unattempted low-resource build is not validation evidence.

### iOS (macOS + Xcode)

```bash
flutter pub get --enforce-lockfile
flutter analyze --no-pub
flutter test --no-pub
flutter build ios --debug --no-codesign --no-pub
```

The final iOS compile/link step requires macOS, Xcode, and Apple's iOS SDK.
App Store publication is not required: a Personal Team can install a developer-
signed build on an owned iPhone, subject to Apple's provisioning lifetime and
account limits. Do not claim the smart-card entitlement is available to a
particular free/paid team until Xcode produces an accepted provisioning profile.
Never commit signing identities or profiles. See `docs/IOS_INTEGRATION.md`.

## What is present vs remaining

### Present in code

- Flutter scaffold + Material 3 UI
- MethodChannel/EventChannel paths for profiles, download, device operations, and notification listing
- OpenEUICC vendored under `third_party/`
- Gradle includes `:app-common`, `:libs:lpac-jni`, `:app-deps`
- Real LPA bridge code path with debug-only mock fallback and release unavailable state; one exact card/device combination has read-only channel/profile-list evidence, but no named model or mutation sign-off
- iOS Runner target and Swift/C bridge for external CryptoTokenKit USB CCID, with Android-only UI capabilities gated out
- Public GitHub repo + docs for handoff

### Remaining (next agent should focus here)

1. Reproduce the Android and unsigned iOS builds in GitHub Actions after commit/push; Windows cannot replace the macOS/Xcode gate
2. **Expand real-device validation** with exact card/phone/OS/reader records: one model-unknown Android 9eSIM combination can list profiles; a same-retailer card on OPPO PME110 / OP61C1L1, Android 16 / API 36 reaches ISD-R then is access-control denied; verified named card models = 0, and mutations/every USB CCID path remain untested
3. Replace the bridge's independently held `DefaultEuiccChannelManager` with the upstream `EuiccChannelManagerService` lifecycle before claiming hotplug/long-running stability
4. Expose notification process/delete through the Dart API and Flutter UI if full parity requires them
5. Optional: Flutter screens for OpenEUICC developer settings (ISD-R AID list, verbose logs UI)
6. Back up the dedicated release keystore/properties and keep the CI release
   bundle/source packaging gates in sync with dependency or license changes
7. Polish UI (animations, empty states, dark theme edge cases)

## Conventions for agents

- Prefer **editing bridge + Flutter**, not forking OpenEUICC UI XML unless necessary
- Keep package id `top.syngnat.lumina.euicc`
- When changing LPA behavior, mirror OpenEUICC/`LocalProfileAssistant` semantics
- Never put secrets, redemption codes, or tokens in this repo
- Commit style used by owner elsewhere: emoji conventional commits, Chinese OK, e.g. `✨ feat(...): ...`
- Push with `gh` auth if available (`gh auth status`); owner is Syngnat

## Related prior work (not in this repo)

- Kotlin-only UI restyle attempt: `LuminaEUICC` under workspace (separate from this Flutter repo)
- User also runs Hermes bots / GoNavi on the same VPS — **do not** mix those concerns into this app unless asked

## Quick verification checklist for a new agent

1. Read this file + `docs/FEATURE_PARITY.md` + `docs/NATIVE_INTEGRATION.md`
2. `git pull` latest `main`
3. Confirm `third_party/OpenEUICC` exists and has `app-common` + `libs/lpac-jni`
4. Use Flutter 3.44.9; run `flutter pub get`, `flutter analyze --no-pub`, `flutter test --no-pub`, and the relevant Android/iOS build command
5. On Android, distinguish per-slot ARA-M denial from missing OMAPI/ISD-R and inspect logcat tag `LuminaEuiccBridge`; on iOS, record whether CryptoTokenKit enumerates the external reader
6. With a real card: list → download → enable/disable → delete; record device/OS/reader/card and sanitized log evidence before claiming success
