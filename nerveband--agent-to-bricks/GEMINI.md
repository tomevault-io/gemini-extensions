  Makefile          build / test / install / deploy-staging
```

## Build and test

```bash
make build          # builds bin/bricks
make install        # installs the CLI into the preferred local bin dir
make install-verify # build/install verification + staging connectivity when configured
make test           # runs all Go tests
make test-verbose   # verbose test output
make lint           # go vet
make check-version  # sync/version drift check, including cli/schema.json
make staging-gate   # full staging deploy + plugin/CLI/template/GUI E2E gate
```

The CLI binary is at `bin/bricks` after build. Tests live next to the code they test (`_test.go` files).

Staging and local install automation are env-driven. Load repo-local `.env` when present and treat `.env.example` as the source of truth for required `ATB_STAGING_*` variables, WP-CLI deploy settings, and optional compatibility aliases.

`docs/test-data/` may contain proprietary/local-only Bricks fixtures and is intentionally gitignored. Public clones must skip private corpus validation cleanly when those fixtures are absent.

## Core philosophy

Treat these as non-optional design constraints on every subsequent code change:

- ShipTypes-style contract-first interfaces: public CLI/plugin/GUI surfaces should be typed, machine-readable, and driven by one canonical contract instead of prose-only behavior.
- Agent DX CLI discipline: preserve or improve structured JSON I/O, raw payload input, schema validation, stable error shapes, pagination/field-selection controls, safety rails, and automation-friendly defaults.
- No silent corruption of structured content: avoid regex or naive string splitting that rewrites valid CSS, HTML, JSON, URLs, or other structured payloads unless the parser is delimiter-aware.
- Docs and implementation move together: when behavior, contract, or workflow changes, update tests, docs, prompts, and `AGENTS.md` in the same change.

If a change would make the product less machine-addressable, less contract-driven, or more likely to damage structured content in transit, treat that as a regression and fix the design before merging.

## CLI architecture

Go module at `cli/`. Entry point is `cli/main.go`. Commands are in `cli/cmd/`. Core libraries are in `cli/internal/`.

Key packages:
- `internal/client/` -- REST API client for the WordPress plugin
- `internal/convert/` -- HTML-to-Bricks converter, class registry, style parser
- `internal/agent/` -- LLM context builder (md/json/prompt output)
- `internal/templates/` -- template catalog, Frames format loader, composer
- `internal/config/` -- YAML config at `~/.agent-to-bricks/config.yaml`

## Plugin architecture

PHP plugin at `plugin/agent-to-bricks/`. REST API namespace: `agent-bricks/v1`.

Auth: `X-ATB-Key` header with API key (generated in WP Admin > Settings > Agent to Bricks).

Key classes:
- `class-elements-api.php` -- GET/PUT/PATCH/DELETE page elements
- `class-classes-api.php` -- global class CRUD
- `class-snapshots-api.php` -- snapshot and rollback
- `class-site-api.php` -- site info, framework detection
- `class-convert-api.php` -- HTML-to-Bricks conversion (tag/style mapping, class resolution)
- `class-element-validator.php` -- element schema validation
- `class-api-auth.php` -- API key auth (hashed storage, X-ATB-Key header)

## Versioning

CLI and plugin share one semver. Both must show the same major.minor version.

- Canonical release version: `VERSION`
- CLI version: injected via ldflags at build time from `VERSION`
- Plugin version: `AGENT_BRICKS_VERSION` constant + `Version:` header in `agent-to-bricks.php`

Only bump versions for a release or when explicitly asked. Use `make sync-version` to propagate `VERSION` into generated/versioned assets before release.

## Release process

Each release is one atomic unit: CLI binaries + plugin zip, same version.

### Steps

1. Update `VERSION`, then run `make sync-version` so the plugin header/constant, docs, and `cli/schema.json` stay aligned.
2. Run the local gate before tagging:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/verify-local-install.sh
   make test
   make lint
   cd cli && go run . schema --validate
   cd gui && npx tsc --noEmit
   find plugin -name "*.php" -exec php -l {} \;
   cd website && npm run build
   ```
3. Run `./scripts/verify-staging-release.sh` when staging credentials are configured. This is the canonical release gate and covers staging deploy, plugin runner matrix, CLI E2E, template smoke, and GUI MCP E2E.
   - If staging SSH uses the 1Password agent, unlock/approve the signing prompt before retrying the deploy or full gate.
4. Commit the release on `main`, push `main`, then push the tag:
   ```bash
   git commit -am "release: vX.Y.Z"
   git push origin main
   make tag-release
   ```
5. GitHub Actions builds the CLI binaries, plugin zip, GUI artifacts, and release assets. Monitor the full workflow and verify the GitHub release body/title after all jobs pass.
6. Reinstall locally after the release commit exists so `bricks --version` resolves to the released SHA, then verify `bricks site info` against staging.

### What the release contains

- `agent-to-bricks_X.Y.Z_darwin_arm64.tar.gz` -- CLI binary (macOS ARM)
- `agent-to-bricks_X.Y.Z_darwin_amd64.tar.gz` -- CLI binary (macOS Intel)
- `agent-to-bricks_X.Y.Z_linux_amd64.tar.gz` -- CLI binary (Linux)
- `agent-to-bricks_X.Y.Z_windows_amd64.zip` -- CLI binary (Windows)
- `agent-to-bricks-plugin-X.Y.Z.zip` -- WordPress plugin
- `checksums.txt` -- SHA256 checksums

## Prompt docs

Use the prompt docs in `prompts/` when you want to hand a repeatable repo workflow to another AI session:

- `prompts/implement.md` -- day-to-day implementation/build/test/doc sync prompt
- `prompts/check.md` -- full verification/docs audit prompt
- `prompts/release.md` -- release, staging, reinstall, and post-release verification prompt

## Update system

CLI leads updates. `bricks update` does:
1. Self-updates CLI binary from GitHub Releases (matches OS/arch)
2. Calls `POST /site/update` to trigger plugin self-update on the connected WordPress site

Plugin checks GitHub every 6 hours and shows a WP admin notice if a new version exists, directing users to run `bricks update` from CLI.

Version mismatch enforcement: every API response includes `X-ATB-Version` header. CLI warns if versions differ, hard-blocks on major version mismatch.

## REST API endpoints

All require `X-ATB-Key` header.

| Endpoint | Method | What it does |
|----------|--------|--------------|
| `/site/info` | GET | Bricks version, WP version, element types |
| `/site/frameworks` | GET | ACSS tokens, framework detection |
| `/site/update` | POST | Trigger plugin self-update from GitHub |
| `/classes` | GET | All global classes (ACSS + Frames) |
| `/classes/<id>` | GET | Single class definition |
| `/pages/<id>/elements` | GET | Page elements + contentHash |
| `/pages/<id>/elements` | PUT | Full replace (requires If-Match header) |
| `/pages/<id>/elements` | PATCH | Patch specific elements |
| `/pages/<id>/elements` | POST | Append elements |
| `/pages/<id>/snapshots` | GET | List snapshots |
| `/pages/<id>/snapshots` | POST | Create snapshot |
| `/pages/<id>/rollback` | POST | Rollback to snapshot |
| `/convert` | POST | HTML-to-Bricks conversion (tag mapping, style parsing, class resolution) |

PUT requires `If-Match: <contentHash>` header. GET elements first to get the hash.

## CLI commands for agent workflows

Beyond the standard CRUD commands, the CLI includes agent-specific workflow commands:

- `bricks discover` -- machine-readable site discovery (info, features, frameworks, classes, variables) in a single JSON payload for LLM context building
- `bricks patch` -- surgical element mutations (`--set`, `--rm`, `--list`) without full-page round-trips
- `bricks init` -- tests connection, installs a `.bricks-skill.md` file, and updates `CLAUDE.md` so AI agents can self-discover capabilities

## Bricks element format

Flat array with parent references (not nested). Each element:

```json
{
  "id": "abc123",
  "name": "section",
  "parent": 0,
  "children": ["def456"],
  "settings": {
    "_cssGlobalClasses": ["acss_import_section__l"],
    "_typography": {"font-size": "var(--h2)"},
    "_padding": {"top": "var(--space-xl)"},
    "tag": "section"
  }
}
```

ACSS class IDs start with `acss_import_`. Frames class IDs do not.

## Conventions

- Go code follows standard go fmt / go vet
- Tests use table-driven patterns where appropriate
- CLI output: user-facing messages to stderr, data to stdout (so piping works)
- Config path: `~/.agent-to-bricks/config.yaml`
- Template cache: `~/.agent-to-bricks/templates/`
- Class registry cache: `~/.agent-to-bricks/class-registry.json`
- Update check cache: `~/.agent-to-bricks/update-check.json`
