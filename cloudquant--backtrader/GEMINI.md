# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Backtrader is a Python-based quantitative trading and backtesting framework for mid-to-low frequency strategies. This is a fork that removes metaclass-based metaprogramming in favor of explicit initialization patterns while maintaining API compatibility with the original backtrader.

- *Branch Context**:
- `dev` branch: Active development with 45% performance improvement, tick-level testing, C++ integration
- `master` branch: Stable version aligned with official backtrader
- `remove-metaprogramming`: Legacy branch for metaclass removal (mostly merged into dev)

- *Performance**: The dev branch achieves 45% faster execution through elimination of metaclasses, broker optimization, and Cython-accelerated calculations.

## Architecture Overview

### Core Class Hierarchy (After Metaclass Removal)

The codebase is transitioning from metaclass-based to mixin-based architecture:

1. **Base Layer**: `metabase.py`
   - `BaseMixin`: Provides `donew()` pattern for explicit initialization
   - `findowner()`: Locates owner objects in the call stack
   - Replaces metaclass logic with explicit method calls

1. **Line System**(bottom-up):
   - `LineRoot` → `LineBuffer` → `LineSeries` → `LineIterator`
   - `LineRoot`: Base interface for line operations and period management
   - `LineBuffer`: Data storage with circular buffer support (`linebuffer.py:~1950 lines`)
   - `LineSeries`: Time series operations and data access
   - `LineIterator`: Iteration logic, prenext/next/once phase management

3.**Operational Classes**:

   - `Indicator` (lineiterator.py): Technical indicators base class
   - `Observer`: Chart observers (volume, cash, etc.)
   - `Analyzer`: Performance metrics and statistics
   - `Strategy`: Trading strategy base class
   - `Data/Feed`: Data source management

1. **Engine**: `cerebro.py` (~88K lines)
   - Main orchestration engine
   - Manages strategies, data feeds, brokers, analyzers
   - Handles backtesting execution flow
   - Coordinates the entire backtesting lifecycle

### Critical Initialization Pattern

- *After metaclass removal, initialization follows this pattern:**

```python

# Old metaclass way (deprecated):

# __new__ + metaclass magic

# New explicit way:

def __new__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
    _obj, args, kwargs = cls.donew(*args, **kwargs)
    return _obj

def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):

# Initialize attributes early

# Call parent class __init__
    super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)

```bash

- *Key Points**:
- `donew()` method replaces metaclass `__call__`
- Owner finding happens in `donew()` via `metabase.findowner()`
- Parameters are initialized before `__init__` is called
- Line buffers are created during parent `__init__` chain

### Indicator Registration System

- *Critical**: Indicators must register themselves with their owner's `_lineiterators` list.

- *Location**: `lineiterator.py:528-556`

- *How it works**:
1. Indicator sets `_ltype = LineIterator.IndType` (value: 0)
2. During `__init__`, if indicator has an owner, it auto-registers
3. Owner's `_next()` method iterates `_lineiterators` to update all indicators
4. Registration must happen early, before any data processing

- *Common Bug**: If indicators aren't registered, they won't update during backtesting.

### Parameter System

- *Location**: `parameters.py` (~76K lines)

Parameters use `AutoOrderedDict` and are initialized via `donew()`:

- Parameters defined at class level with `params = (...)` or `params = dict(...)`
- Values passed as kwargs override defaults
- Accessed via `self.p.parametername` or `self.params.parametername`

- *Critical**: Parameters are NOT available until after `super().__init__()` is called. The initialization chain sets up `self.p` and `self.params` attributes.

### Data Flow

```bash
Data Feed → Cerebro → Strategy → Indicators/Observers/Analyzers
                ↓
             Broker ← Orders

```bash

1. Cerebro loads data feeds and runs the main loop
2. Data is fed bar-by-bar (or tick-by-tick in dev branch)
3. Strategy receives data updates via `prenext()`, `nextstart()`, `next()`
4. Indicators are calculated automatically before strategy logic
5. Strategy generates orders sent to broker
6. Analyzers collect performance metrics

### Phase System

Backtrader has three execution phases:

1. **prenext**: Initial bars where minperiod hasn't been reached
2. **nextstart**: Transition bar where minperiod is first satisfied
3. **next**: Normal operation after minperiod

Alternative optimized mode uses:

- **once**: Batch processing all bars at once (faster but more complex)

## Key Files and Their Purposes

### Core Engine

- `cerebro.py`: Main backtesting engine and orchestrator
- `broker.py`, `brokers/`: Order execution and portfolio management
- `strategy.py`: Base class for trading strategies

### Line System

- `lineroot.py`: Base classes and interfaces
- `linebuffer.py`: Data storage with circular buffers (~1950 lines)
- `lineseries.py`: Time series operations (~75K lines)
- `lineiterator.py`: Iterator logic and execution phases (~94K lines)
- `dataseries.py`: Data accessor interfaces

- *Key Concept**: The Line system is the core data structure. Lines are time series that support:
- Circular buffering for memory efficiency
- Lazy evaluation for indicators
- Period management (minperiod before valid data)
- Access patterns like `data.close[0]` (current), `data.close[-1]` (previous)

### Data Management

- `feed.py`: Base data feed classes
- `feeds/`: Various data source implementations (CSV, pandas, live feeds)
- `resamplerfilter.py`: Data resampling and filtering

### Indicators

- `indicator.py`: Base indicator class
- `indicators/`: 60+ technical indicators
- `indicators/contrib/`: Community-contributed indicators

### Analysis

- `analyzer.py`: Base analyzer class
- `analyzers/`: Performance metrics (Sharpe, drawdown, returns, etc.)
- `observer.py`, `observers/`: Chart observers

### Utilities

- `metabase.py`: Base mixins and owner-finding logic (critical for post-metaclass code)
- `utils/`: Date handling, performance calculations, logging
- `utils/*_cython/`: Cython-optimized calculations for `ts` and `cs` modes
- `utils/ts_cal_value/`: Time series mode Cython implementations
- `utils/cs_cal_value/`: Cross-section mode calculations
- `utils/cal_performance_indicators/`: Performance metrics in Cython

### Visualization

- `plot/plot_plotly.py`: Interactive charts with zoom, pan, hover (100k+ data points)
- `plot/`: Matplotlib-based static plotting for papers/reports
- Supports multiple backends: Plotly, Bokeh, Matplotlib

## Special Features

### TS (Time Series) Mode

Fast vectorized backtesting using pandas operations. See `utils/ts_cal_value/` for Cython implementations.

### CS (Cross-Section) Mode

Multi-asset portfolio backtesting with cross-sectional signals. See `utils/cs_cal_value/` and `utils/cs_long_short_signals/`.

### Cython Optimization

Performance-critical calculations are implemented in Cython for 10-100x speedup:

- `utils/cal_performance_indicators/`: Performance metrics
- `utils/ts_cal_value/`: Time series calculations
- `utils/cs_cal_value/`: Cross-section calculations
- Compile via: `cd backtrader && python -W ignore compile_cython_numba_files.py`

## Testing Notes

### Test Organization

- `tests/original_tests/`: Core functionality tests (300+ tests)
- `tests/add_tests/`: Additional test coverage
- `tests/refactor_tests/`: Tests for metaclass removal refactoring
- `tests/strategies/`: Strategy-specific test cases

### Test Configuration

- **pytest.ini**: Configures test discovery and warning filters
- **conftest.py**: Handles temp directory cleanup (fixes Windows permission issues)
- Parallel execution via pytest-xdist (`-n` flag) is recommended for speed
- RuntimeWarning and DeprecationWarning are filtered by default

### When Writing Tests

- Use fixtures from `conftest.py` if available
- Test with minimal data (10-20 bars) for unit tests
- Verify indicator registration via `strategy._lineiterators`
- Check minperiod handling in prenext/next phases
- Ensure cleanup after tests (no shared state)
- Tests should pass on both `dev` and `master` branches for correctness validation

## Common Tasks

### Adding a New Indicator

1. Create file in `backtrader/indicators/`
2. Inherit from `bt.Indicator`
3. Define `lines = ('output_line',)` for result storage
4. Define `params = (('param_name', default_value),)`
5. Implement `__init__()` with calculation logic
6. Set `self.lines.output_line = calculation`
7. Add to `indicators/__init__.py`

### Adding a New Strategy

1. Inherit from `bt.Strategy`
2. Define parameters with `params = (...)`
3. Implement `__init__()` to set up indicators
4. Implement `next()` for trading logic
5. Use `self.buy()`, `self.sell()`, `self.close()` for orders

### Debugging Line Issues

- Check `len(obj)` returns expected value
- Verify `obj._minperiod` is set correctly
- Ensure `obj._owner` is assigned
- For indicators, verify `obj._ltype == 0` (IndType)
- Check `obj` appears in `owner._lineiterators`

## Code Style

- Line length: 100 characters (Black configuration)
- Python 3.8+ (tested on 3.8-3.13)
- Type hints are encouraged but not strictly required
- Use descriptive variable names (avoid single letters except in loops)
- Comments in Chinese and English are both present in the codebase

### Configuration Files

- `pyproject.toml`: Black (line-length=100), mypy, coverage, bandit, isort, ruff configuration
- `pytest.ini`: Test discovery and warning filters
- `.pylintrc`: Pylint rules for code quality checks

## Important Constraints

### Metaclass Removal Project

The codebase has removed most metaclass usage. When working on this:

1. **Never introduce new metaclasses**- use mixins with `donew()` pattern instead

2.**Preserve API compatibility**- existing user code must work unchanged
3.**Maintain initialization order**- parent `__init__` before accessing `self.p` or lines
4.**Test on both branches**- ensure consistency between `dev` and `master` when validating fixes

### Parameter Access

Always call `super().__init__()`**before** accessing `self.p` or `self.params`. The initialization chain sets up these attributes.

### Owner Assignment

Objects need to know their owner (e.g., indicator needs its strategy/data). This happens via:

- `metabase.findowner()` in `donew()` method
- Manual assignment if auto-detection fails
- Owner is needed for indicator registration and data access

## Performance Considerations

- Cython extensions provide 10-100x speedup for calculations
- Use `qbuffer()` to limit memory for long backtests
- The `once()` mode is faster than `next()` mode but harder to implement
- TS/CS modes are optimized for multi-asset portfolios
- Broker optimizations: removed global `__getattribute__` overloads, implemented local parameter caching
- Indicator optimizations: optimized `once()` methods, reduced redundant built-in function calls in hot paths
- Minimize `isinstance()`, `hasattr()`, and `len()` calls in performance-critical code
