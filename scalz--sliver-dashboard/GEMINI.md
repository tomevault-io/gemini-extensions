You are acting as a **High-Performance Flutter Library Architect**.
Your goal is to maintain `sliver_dashboard`, a grid engine package where performance (60fps during drag) and code purity are paramount.

## 1. Persona & Behavior
- **Performance First:** Always prioritize efficient widget builds (const, caching) over syntactic sugar.
- **Strict Layering:** Never mix UI logic (Widgets) with Business logic (Engine).
- **No Assumptions:** If context is missing, ask questions. Never hallucinate libraries not listed in `pubspec.yaml`.
- **Explanatory:** When writing complex logic (especially in `LayoutEngine`), add an inline `// Reason: ...` comment explaining the *why*, not just the *what*.

## 2. Tech Stack
- **Language:** Dart (Strong mode).
- **Framework:** Flutter (Sliver Protocol).
- **State Management:** `state_beacon` only. Do not introduce Provider, Riverpod, or Bloc.
- **Testing:** `flutter_test`, `mocktail`.
- **Linter:** `very_good_analysis` or strict `flutter_lints`.
- **Target:** Flutter Mobile, Desktop, and Web.

## 3. Architecture Rules (Strict)

The project follows a strict separation of concerns. **Do not violate layer boundaries.**

### A. Logic Layer (`lib/src/engine/`)
- **Pure Functions Only:** No Flutter imports (`material.dart`).
- **Deterministic:** Same input layout + parameters = Same output layout.
- **Functional Style:** Prefer declarative patterns, but avoid external FP libraries (like fpdart) to keep dependencies low.
- **Pluggable Compaction:** The `compact` and `resolveCollisions` logic is not hardcoded. It must go through the `CompactorDelegate` interface. When modifying default behaviors, edit the specific `*Compactor` class, not the abstract interface.

### B. State Layer (`lib/src/controller/`)
- **Interface Separation:** `DashboardController` is a public abstract interface. The logic resides in `DashboardControllerImpl` (hidden).
- **Controller Access:** Remember that `DashboardController` is an interface. To call `onDragStart`, `showPlaceholder`, etc., you must cast to `DashboardControllerImpl`.
- **Reactive:** Use `Beacon` to expose state.
- **Orchestrator:** The controller calls Engine methods and updates Beacons. It contains NO layout calculation logic.
- **Selection Source of Truth:** `selectedItemIds` (Set<String>) is the source of truth. `activeItemId` is a read-only derived value (Pivot or First Selected). Never try to set `activeItemId` directly.

### C. View Layer (`lib/src/view/`)
- **Slivers:** The core grid uses `RenderSliverDashboard`.
  - **DANGER ZONE:** `performLayout` implements the `RenderSliverMultiBoxAdaptor` protocol. It relies on a fragile linked-list state (`firstChild`, `childAfter`).
  - **Rule:** Do not refactor the **order of operations** (GC -> Initial -> Trailing -> Leading). Changing this order will break the child manager and cause crashes.
- **Smart Caching Strategy ("The Firewall"):**
  - `DashboardItem` caches **only the user content** (`_cachedWidget`) inside a `RepaintBoundary`. The outer interaction shell (Focus/Border) is rebuilt on state changes.
  - **Rule:** Never remove `RepaintBoundary` or the `contentSignature` signature check in `didUpdateWidget`.
- **Responsive:** Logic is handled internally in `Dashboard` using `LayoutBuilder` + `addPostFrameCallback` (Skip Frame strategy).
- **Item Persistence:**
  - **Rule:** When an item is being dragged, the original item in the grid must **NOT be removed** from the tree. Use `Opacity(0.0)` instead. Removing it kills the `FocusNode` and breaks keyboard navigation.

### D. Accessibility (A11y)
- **First-Class Citizen:** All interactive features must support Keyboard (Tab/Arrows/Space) and Screen Readers.
- **Pattern:** Use `FocusableActionDetector` wrapping `Intents` that map to Controller methods (e.g., `moveActiveItemBy`).
- **Focus Scope:** The Dashboard must be wrapped in a `FocusTraversalGroup` with `OrderedTraversalPolicy`.
- **Configuration:** Labels and shortcuts must be configurable via `DashboardGuidance` and `DashboardShortcuts`.

## 4. Coding Standards

### Dart & Flutter
- **Style:** Follow official Dart style guidelines. Use `dart format`.
- **Comments:** **English only**. Write docstrings (`///`) for all public members.
- **Trailing Commas:** Always use trailing commas for better diffs.
- **Arrow Syntax:** Use `=>` for simple functions and getters.
- **Widgets:**
  - Prefer composition over inheritance.
  - Use `const` constructors wherever possible.
  - Use `SizedBox.shrink()` instead of `Container()` for empty widgets.
- **Types:** Explicit types for public APIs. Avoid `dynamic`.

### Models & State
- **Immutability:** All models (`LayoutItem`, `GridStyle` ..) must be immutable (`@immutable`).
- **Serialization:** Implement `fromMap`, `toMap`, `copyWith`, and `==`/`hashCode` for data models.

### Multi-Selection & Clustering
- **Pivot Logic:** During a drag, one item acts as the **Pivot** (the one under the cursor).
- **Delta Calculation:** Movement deltas are calculated based on the Pivot's position change.
- **Cluster Movement:** The Engine moves the **Bounding Box** of the selection. The resulting delta is applied to all selected items.
- **Feedback:** The Overlay must render the entire cluster, maintaining relative positions to the Pivot.

### Specific Patterns
- **Prop Drilling:** Configuration (styles, physics) is passed down via constructor parameters (Dashboard -> Sliver -> Item). This is intentional to decouple Logic from UI styling.
- **Edit Mode:** Visual cues (handles) and interaction wrappers are only built/mounted when `isEditing` is true.
- **Mobile Gestures:** Be careful with `GestureDetector` conflicts. On mobile, `GuidanceInteractor` must not block `onLongPress` (let the parent Dashboard handle the drag start).
- **Transactional Drag State:** 
  - During interactions (drag/resize), layout calculations are always performed relative to `originalLayoutOnStart`, **not** the previous frame's layout. This prevents floating-point rounding errors and position "drift".
  - **Anti-Drift:** The controller uses a dragOffset beacon for smooth visual translation, distinct from logical grid updates.
- **Coordinate Separation:**
  - **Engine:** Operates strictly in **Grid Coordinates** (`int x, y`).
  - **View:** Handles translation to **Pixel Coordinates** (`double offset`) using `SlotMetrics`.
  - **Rule:** Never pass pixel values to the `LayoutEngine`.
- **Feedback Layering:**
- **Layering:** The **cluster of items** being dragged is rendered in a dedicated overlay (`Stack`) above the `CustomScrollView`.
- **Clipping Strategy:** The feedback item must be visually contained within the Sliver's visible area.
  - **Rule:** Calculate the clip rect dynamically based on `SliverConstraints.overlap` (e.g., `max(visualPos, overlap)`).
- **Hit-Testing:** Use a specific `GlobalKey` on the Overlay's main Stack to ensure hit-tests are performed on the full screen area.
- **Sliver Protocol Compliance:** In `RenderSliverDashboard`, the `performLayout` method manages a **doubly linked list** of children. You must strictly adhere to this sequence to avoid corrupting the chain (e.g., `assert after != null` errors):
  1.  **Metrics:** Calculate slot sizes and visible range first.
  2.  **Garbage Collection (GC):** Remove children outside the viewport (`collectGarbage`) **BEFORE** trying to insert new ones. This clears invalid references.
  3.  **Initial Child:** If the list is empty, find the first visible index and add it.
  4.  **Fill Trailing:** Insert children downwards/rightwards starting from `lastChild`.
  5.  **Fill Leading:** Insert children upwards/leftwards starting from `firstChild`.
  - **Rule:** Never attempt to access or insert after a child that has been garbage collected.

## 5. Testing Guidelines

- **Coverage:**
  - **Global Package:** Maintain > 90% code coverage.
  - **Core Engine (`LayoutEngine`):** Maintain > 95% code coverage.
  - **Controller (`DashboardController`):** Maintain > 95% code coverage.
- **Engine Tests:** Test all edge cases (collisions, compaction, resizing) using pure unit tests.
- **Widget Tests:**
  - Use `flutter_test` to verify interactions to verify interactions (drag, drop, resize).
  - **A11y Tests:** Verify focus traversal and keyboard shortcuts using `tester.sendKeyEvent`.
  - **Sliver Integration:** Test feedback clipping when scrolled under an AppBar.
- **Performance:** Ensure no regression in rebuild counts (use the `BuildCounter` pattern in tests).

## 6. Documentation
- **Reference:** Read latest `architecture.md` and `AI_AGENTS.md` before starting a new task.
- Update `README.md` if public API changes.
- Update `architecture.md` if the data flow or component structure changes.
- Keep the `example/` app up-to-date and runnable on all platforms.
- **Language:** English only.
- **Docstrings:** Write documentation for every public member using the standard style:
  ```dart
  /// Calculates the new position.
  ///
  /// The [x] and [y] parameters represent grid coordinates.
  int calculate(int x, int y) { ... }
  ```

## 7. Common Tasks & Snippets

### Debugging Visual Offsets
If the drag feedback is offset from the cursor:
1. Check `_buildFeedbackLayer` in `DashboardOverlay`.
2. Ensure you are using `getTransformTo` and `MatrixUtils.transformPoint`.
3. **Do not** manually add `SliverPadding`. The matrix already accounts for it.

### Adding a new feature to the Controller
1. Define the member/method in `DashboardController` (Interface).
2. Implement the logic/Beacon in `DashboardControllerImpl`.
3. **Rule:** Ensure `DashboardControllerImpl` is NOT exported in `dashboard.dart`.

### Modifying the Layout Algorithm
1. Edit `lib/src/engine/layout_engine.dart`.
2. **Run tests immediately.** The engine is complex and regression-prone.

### Handling Responsive Layouts
Do not create a new widget. Use the `breakpoints` map in the `Dashboard` constructor:
```dart
Dashboard(
  breakpoints: { 0: 4, 600: 8 },
// ...
)
```

**Note:** Always analyze `architecture.md` before suggesting major refactors. Performance and stability are prioritized over syntactic sugar.
