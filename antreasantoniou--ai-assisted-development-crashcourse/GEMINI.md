dart_coding_style_guidelines: |
  1. **Language & Formatting**:
      - Use dart format --line-length 100 (configured in dart_tool/package_config.json) to
        guarantee consistent 2-space indentation and brace placement.
      - Run dart fix --apply and dart analyze on every commit; fail CI on warnings.
      - Include an analysis_options.yaml that extends the latest
        package:very_good_analysis/analysis_options.yaml (or flutter_lints for Flutter
        layers). Add project-specific rules only when they improve signal-to-noise.
      - Prefer named imports with show/hide; never use wildcard * imports.

  2. **Naming Conventions**:
      - **lowerCamelCase** for variables, functions, parameters, getters & setters.
      - **UpperCamelCase** for classes, enums, typedefs, extensions, mixins, and annotations.
      - **SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE** for const values and enum entries that represent flags.
      - Prefix booleans with is, has, should, or can.
      - Avoid single-letter identifiers except trivial loop indices.

  3. **Documentation & Comments**:
      - Write DartDoc triple-slash /// comments for every public library, class,
        extension, mixin, and member. Include:
          * High-level purpose
          * Parameters ([paramName] — description)
          * Return value
          * Possible exceptions
      - Use inline // comments sparingly to explain why non-obvious code exists.
      - Keep comments in sync with behavior; outdated docs are worse than none.

  4. **Code Structure & Modularity**:
      - Embrace the Single Responsibility Principle; functions <40 LOC and classes
        <300 LOC are a smell that code is growing complex.
      - Organize related APIs into libraries (library directive) and export them via
        barrel files (<feature>/<feature>.dart exports).
      - Reach for part/part of only to split very large libraries; prefer packages
        otherwise.
      - Hide implementation details by prefixing internal identifiers with _.

  5. **Clarity, Intuitiveness & Simplicity**:
      - Leverage Dart's sound null-safety; favor final/const over var and
        late only when initialization is truly deferred.
      - Opt for extension methods, collection if/for, and pattern matching to make
        intent explicit.
      - Flatten deeply nested control flow by extracting private helpers.

  6. **Efficiency**:
      - Mark immutable objects const; they are canonicalized at compile-time.
      - Use isolates for CPU-bound tasks; avoid blocking the main isolate.
      - Cache heavy objects (e.g., regex, render objects) where reuse is expected.
      - Profile with DevTools before micro-optimizing; document benchmarks in /bench.

  7. **Testing**:
      - Write unit tests with the test package (or flutter_test for widgets).
      - Target ≥80 % line coverage on critical packages; gate PRs on coverage delta.
      - Use mocktail/mockito for fakes and golden_toolkit for widget-level
        regression tests.
      - Integration tests run via dart test -t integration or flutter test -d.

  8. **General Philosophy**:
      - Code for the next maintainer—clarity beats cleverness.
      - Follow the project's established idioms; when in doubt, justify deviations in
        the PR description.
      - Embrace code reviews, static analysis, and automated formatting as teaching
        tools.

  9. **CLI Output & Progress**:
      - For command-line apps, use package:dart_console or
        package:cli_progress to provide colored, width-adaptive output and progress
        bars.
      - Respect non-interactive environments: hide spinners behind
        if (stdout.supportsAnsiEscapes) checks.

 10. **Output Quality & Informativeness**:
      - Craft log messages with the logging package; route records through
        Logger.root.onRecord.listen to integrate with observability backends.
      - Include actionable guidance in error messages and surface stack traces only
        in verbose/debug modes.
      - Never import internal members directly; always go through the public
        package API.
      - Keep model identifiers centralized (e.g., lib/src/constants.dart) so upgrades
        require a single change.

### 11.2 Import Styles
- **Full Paths REQUIRED**: All `import` statements in Dart and Python MUST use the full package URI (e.g., `package:project_name/path/to/file.dart` or `import my_project.utils.helpers`). Relative paths (`../` or `./`) are strictly forbidden. This rule is non-negotiable.
- **Liberal Use of `show`**: For Dart imports, make liberal use of the `show` directive to explicitly declare which symbols are being imported. This prevents namespace pollution and improves clarity. Hiding symbols with `hide` is also acceptable where appropriate.

  Example:
  ```dart
  import 'package:guarded_core_openapi/api.dart' show Application, PrivacyEnum, UserProfile;
  ```

  - [fire](https://github.com/google/python-fire) for command-line interfaces
When creating new entries from templates, automatically populate created_date and last_updated_date with the current date. Ensure finished_date is present with the placeholder "YYYY-MM-DD" or as defined in the template.

## 8. ADAPTIVE LEARNING & RULE EVOLUTION
Continuously learn from our interactions to improve assistance. Note effective strategies and user preferences for future reference.

**Proactive Rule Updates**: If you identify a significant piece of feedback, a new directive, or a recurring pattern that could improve our long-term collaboration, you MUST proactively propose an update to this `.cursorrules` file. Clearly explain the rationale for the change and the specific modification being suggested. This ensures valuable insights are integrated directly into our operational framework.

## 9. FEEDBACK MECHANISM
Periodically ask for feedback on the assistance provided to improve future interactions.

## 10. SAFETY AND ETHICS
Adhere to ethical AI principles. Prioritize user well-being and safety. Do not engage in or encourage harmful behaviors.

## 11. PROJECT-SPECIFIC DIRECTIVES

### 11.1 Prototyping in a Playground
When exploring a new approach, feature, or unfamiliar data structure, always
create new, minimal example scripts under a 'playground/' directory.
Use these scripts to explore and learn the specifics of the task at hand
(e.g., parsing a file, testing a library feature) before attempting to
integrate the solution back into the more complex, main codebase.
This de-risks the approach and avoids repeated failures in the main workflow.

Import Styles

When importing packages in python or dart, always use the full path, no relative paths PLEASE.

When you make changes, before we deem a feature completed, run git diff to compare the files you changed to how they were before, and sanity check that the changes make sense.
