# AGENTS.md — handoff for the next agent

Read this first, then [`docs/IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md`](docs/IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md) for what
is open and [`docs/ROADMAP.md`](docs/ROADMAP.md) for what is done.

The completed plan documents live in
[`docs/history/`](docs/history/) — including `PLAN.md`, which this line used to
send you to first. They are worth reading for *why* something was built the way
it was, and they are not current instructions; the figures in them are the
figures of their own day.

**FactoryForge** is a free, open 3D factory simulator for learning PLC
programming — a replacement for Factory I/O, which is stagnant, closed to custom
parts, and €278/year. See [`docs/PRD.md`](docs/PRD.md) for the full rationale.

## Live hardware

| What | Detail |
|---|---|
| **S7-PLCSIM Advanced** | V6.0 Upd1, instance `test`, **TCP/IP Single Adapter, communication with `<Local>`** (the PLCSIM virtual adapter, "Ethernet 2", 192.168.0.100/24). The CPU is `192.168.0.20`, OPC UA at `opc.tcp://192.168.0.20:4840`, S7 on 102. Until 2026-09-29 this said 192.168.1.20: that is the Wi-Fi's subnet and nothing reached it. Softbus ("PLCSIM") mode works for TIA and the native driver only, and a Multiple Adapter instance on `<Default>` fails with "Interface mapping is invalid or missing" |
| CPU | 1511-1 PN, FW V2.9, TIA Portal V19 |
| PLC program | TIA project `D:\projects\Tia portal mcp\projects\FactoryForge_Sorting` (built through TiaCommander + Openness on 2026-09-29): the 19-member `FF_IO` + FB `SortingByHeight` (the first-hour program, `examples/graded/first_hour_sorting_by_height.scl`). The `Sorting.scl` v0.4 build is archived as `D:\projects\Tia portal mcp\archives\FactoryForge_Sorting_scl_v04_*.zap19` |
| Node ids | `ns=3;s="FF_IO"."ConveyorRotate"` etc. — quotes are part of the identifier |

The user has **no physical PLC**. PLCSIM Advanced is the reference target and
simulates only the S7-1500 family. Plain bundled PLCSIM has no external network
interface and cannot be used.

```

The **tag bus** ([`docs/tag-bus.md`](docs/tag-bus.md)) is the seam and the most
important contract in the project. Two engine implementations already speak it
(`sidecar/factoryforge_sidecar/engine_stub.py`, still importable as
`harness/engine_stub.py`, and `engine/src/TagBus/TagBusServer.cs`) and the
sidecar cannot tell them apart. Keep it that way.

`kind` is always from the **controller's** point of view: `output` = PLC writes
it, `input` = simulator writes it. This trips everyone up; it is enforced.

### Layout

```
engine/          Godot 4.7 C# project
  src/TagBus/    Tag, TagTable, TagBusServer  (C# port, must match Python)
  src/Scenes/    SortingScene.cs              (port of sidecar/.../sorting_scene.py)
  src/View/      SceneView.cs, OrbitCamera.cs (reads state only, never writes)
harness/         aliases: engine_stub.py and scene.py *are* the sidecar's modules
sidecar/         Python package: bus client, drivers, minimal Modbus server,
                 the Python engine reference (engine_stub.py), the headless
                 sorting scene (sorting_scene.py) and the grader (grading/)
examples/tia/    Sorting.scl, FF_IO DB spec, setup walkthrough
examples/nodered/ flow that replaces the PLC entirely
tools/           drive_engine.py (parity check), drv_trace.py (driver tracing)

## Two conventions the parts depend on

**Every part's origin sits on the work plane** (`PartLayout.WorkPlaneY`, y = 0.5),
and each part offsets its own geometry from there — sensor posts and the pusher
pedestal reach down to the floor, the chute's deck hangs below and forward of its
anchor. That is why the scene editor can snap X/Z to the 0.5 m grid, pin Y, and
have any part land correctly. Never bake a mounting height into a scene position.

It holds per level (IP-15): a part on level *n* sits on `PartLayout.PlaneY(n)`,
0.9 m (`LevelHeight`, the lift's pitch) per level, and that level's floor is
`FloorDrop` below it — the top of a `Mezzanine` deck — so every part's legs
land on a raised floor unchanged. A scene file stores the level as its own key
with Y still the in-level 0.5, and is stamped version 2.0 only when a part is
raised; a version-1 build refuses that file rather than putting everything on
the floor, and still opens every file with nothing raised. `PgUp`/`PgDn` pick
the level to place on, or lift a selection. Anything that reads a part's height
from a scene file must add `level × LevelHeight` (`SceneData.WorldY`, the
grader's `Part.world_y`).

**A part's instance id is a tag *prefix*, never a whole tag name.** The dispatch
in `SceneEditor._PhysicsProcess` appends the suffix, so registering a part as
`"conveyor.rotate"` looks up `conveyor.rotate.rotate` and silently disables it.

**A part's settings must be in `PartProperties`, or they are lost.** Scene files
store a properties map next to the transform. Anything a part reads in `_Ready`
and is not captured there silently reverts on load — which once cost the
removers their count tags and the sensors their `VisualOnly` flag. The converse
also bites: a value the part *computes* every tick is not a setting, and saving
it stores a sample and restores it as configuration. `VariableConveyor.Speed` is
the case — the drive recomputes it from the speed reference, so `PartProperties`
skips it for that subclass and `--self-test=scene` asserts its absence.

**The palette is generated from `PartCatalog`, not written by hand.** One entry
gives a part its button, its group, its tooltip, its summary in the property
inspector, and its place in `--self-test=scene`'s round-trip. That list used to
be written out three times and a part missing from one of the copies was a part
nobody checked could be saved. Adding a part means adding a catalog entry; see
the "everything a part must touch" table in `docs/PART_AUTHORING.md`.

**`inposition` on a positioning axis is stale on the scan that commands a
move.** `PickPlaceArm.InPosition` compares the axis to the target *the machine
currently holds*, and a target written this scan does not reach the machine
until the next physics tick — so the bit still reports "arrived", at the place
you are trying to leave. Both the demo profile and `tools/try_scene.py` released
every carton straight back onto the pick station because of it. Check the
position feedback against the destination the step wants, not the bit alone.
This is exactly the mistake a student will make, so both files carry the
explanation rather than only the fix.

**A click means one thing at a time.** `SceneEditor.Mode` is `Edit` or `Run`
(`F1`). Edit mode selects, moves and deletes; Run mode routes a left click to
`PressControlAt`, which asks each `ButtonPanel` whether the ray hit one of its
*caps* — not the part's bounding box, which also covers the housing, the
pedestal and both lamps, and would turn the whole station into one big Start
button. Everything that reflects the mode (toolbar label, palette visibility)
listens to `ModeChanged` rather than tracking it separately.

**Momentary means one edge, held long enough to be seen.** A click lands on the
frame clock and tags are written on the physics clock, so a click on
`ButtonPanel` only *requests* a press and `ButtonPanel.StepPart` moves the
contact. It closes for `PressHold` (200 ms, a panel setting) and then stays open
at least as long; a click while it is closed is the same press (a double-click
is one Start, not a phantom second one), and a click while it re-opens waits out
the gap and then makes its own edge. Holding the mouse down still yields exactly
one clean edge. The rule used to be *one scan, not one mouse-down*, and the pulse
was one physics tick: correct against a program scanning inside the engine,
which no controller does. A Modbus master polling every 50 ms saw 12 of 50 such
clicks (IP-31, `tools/click_poll_repro.py`), and the grader, holding its presses
0.15 s, could pass a program that ignored the real Start button. The hold is
counted in physics ticks, not simulated seconds, because Godot paces ticks by
the wall clock at every time scale and the poller is on the wall clock too.
`scanner.read` follows the same rule (`BarcodeScanner.ReadHold`). Note
`panel.estop` is inverted on purpose: **normally closed**, true = healthy.

**The engine speaks the tag bus and nothing else.** Every PLC protocol lives in
the Python sidecar, so "connect to a PLC" always means "start the sidecar
against the running engine" — `factoryforge_sidecar connect`, never `demo`. The
F5 dialog does exactly that (`DriverConnectionUI.LaunchSidecar`) and copies the
command, because the launch can fail for reasons the engine cannot fix, such as
python not being on PATH.

**An instance id is a name, so let people choose it.** `SceneEditor.TryRenamePart`
moves every tag under the old prefix, keeping types, kinds and values, and
refuses rather than half-applying. Parts that only *view* simulation-owned tags
cannot be renamed at all — `SortingScene` writes `conveyor.rotate` by that exact
name every tick.

**Changing the scene has to be announced.** Placing, deleting or renaming a part
changes the I/O list, and a connected driver is working from the tag list it was
handed at connect time. `SceneEditor` raises `TagsChanged`; `Main` answers it
with `_bus.SendDescribe()`. The bus always knew how to republish — for a long
time nothing asked it to.

**Simulation controls are engine-global.** Run/pause and time scale go through
`Engine.TimeScale`, so one switch covers the fixed-timestep accumulator, Jolt,
and every part animation. The tag bus is deliberately exempt — it polls from
`_Process`, which Godot still calls at time scale 0, so a paused scene keeps its
PLC session instead of dropping it. `--duration` and `--screenshot-at` run on
wall-clock for the same reason: a paused run whose clock also stopped would
never terminate.

**Two scenes, one tag interface.** The engine launches the *rigid-body* scene:
real colliders, real gravity, a held-out pusher genuinely blocks the line.
`--deterministic` swaps in the fixed-timestep `SortingScene` instead — that one
advances by exactly `TickMs`, mirrors `sorting_scene.py`, and is the regression
contract (`tools/drive_engine.py` → `tall=5 short=5`). Jolt cannot promise
reproducible counts, so **anything asserting exact numbers must pass
`--deterministic`.**

Both declare the same ten tags via `SortingTags.Declare`, and both report the
same scene name on the bus, so the same `Sorting.scl` or Node-RED flow drives
either without noticing. Keep it that way: if you add a tag to one, add it to
`SortingTags`.

## Hard-won gotchas — these cost hours, do not rediscover them

1. **The S7-1500 forces a 1000 ms subscription publishing interval**, silently
   revising whatever you request. Any signal that rises and falls inside one
   second can vanish. This is why `opcua_client.py` **polls by default**.
   Raising `queuesize` / lowering `sampling_interval` makes it strictly *worse*
   — the S7 rejects them and then reports nothing at all.

2. **On Windows, `asyncio.sleep()` under ~15.6 ms returns immediately.** The
   clock resolution is 15.6 ms and asyncio treats anything inside that window as
   already expired. A 500-iteration poll loop finished in 10 ms of real time.
   Never count iterations to measure time; measure real elapsed time. Tests must
   wait on events, not poll with short sleeps.

3. **Fixed timestep needs a wall-clock accumulator.** Stepping once per
   `sleep(tick_ms)` runs the sim slow (first version ran at ~60% of real time).
   Both engines accumulate real elapsed time and run whole fixed steps. Never
   switch to variable dt — it destroys reproducibility.

4. **`fake_plc.py` is a logic check only, not an authority.** It passed two SCL
   versions that failed on the real CPU. A Python scan loop reproduces IEC timer
   semantics but not a real CPU's scan behaviour. **Trust the PLC over the
   model.** (I got this wrong and told the user their download hadn't landed
   when their code was in fact running.)

5. **Never write `#tEmit(IN := NOT #tEmit.Q, ...)` in SCL.** It makes `Q` high
   for one scan; on a real S7-1500 the follow-on statement did not execute. Hold
   `IN := TRUE` so `Q` latches, then reset explicitly. There is a warning
   comment in `Sorting.scl`.

6. **Never kill test processes with `os._exit()`.** Each leaks an OPC UA session;
   the S7 allows only a few and then refuses connections for ~35 s. Use
   `demo --duration N`, which shuts down cleanly.

7. **One OPC UA session at a time against the S7.** Running the driver plus a
   separate monitoring client destabilised the server. Instrument the driver
   instead — `tools/drv_trace.py` prints every write and receive.

8. **asyncua's default 4 s connect timeout is too short for a real S7.** Use
   `timeout=10`.

9. **Never run Node-RED against `C:\Users\masal\.node-red`** — it holds the
   user's own flows. Use a temp userDir with a **junction** to their
   `node_modules`, and remove it with `cmd //c rmdir` (not `rm -rf`, which
   follows the junction and would delete their packages).

10. **A click handler must use the event's position, not the cursor's.**
    `GetViewport().GetMousePosition()` returns where the pointer *is now*, which
    for a real click is the same place — and for a synthesized one is not. Run
    mode's first version used it and worked for nobody except by accident: the
    headless self-test passed every assertion it could reach while clicking a
    button did nothing at all. Take the position off the `InputEventMouseButton`.
    (Edit mode's press does too now: `PickPartAt(clickBtn.Position)` in
    `SceneEditor.Input.cs`. The one live-cursor read left in the editor is
    `UpdatePreviewPosition`, the placement ghost, which is meant to follow the
    pointer rather than a click.)

11. **A UI that configures nothing is worse than no UI.** The F4 wiring panel
    kept its mappings in a dictionary nothing outside that file ever read, and
    F5's "Apply & Connect" assigned four fields and hid the dialog. Both looked
    like they worked. If a panel implies an effect, follow the value to whoever
    consumes it before believing it — `grep` for the field, not for the button.

12. **A crashing self-test can exit 0.** An exception inside `_PhysicsProcess`
    is logged by Godot and execution continues, so a test that throws before its
    report never reports, the run ends via `--duration`, and the exit code is
    success. Wrap the body in try/catch and count a throw as a failure.

13. **`Quit()` takes effect at the end of the frame.** A self-test that does its
    work in `_PhysicsProcess` runs again on the next tick — against state the
    first pass already mutated — burying the real failure under repeats. Latch a
    `_done` flag.

14. **A failed `dotnet build` leaves the previous binary in place**, and Godot
    runs it without complaint. A run that produces no output where you expected
    some is more likely a stale binary than a logic error; check the build
    result before debugging the code.

15. **Godot hangs if its stdout is a pipe nobody drains**, and it fills that
    buffer *before* it binds the tag bus — so a piped engine prints its banner
    and then waits forever, listening on nothing. Measured: inherited stdout or
    a file, port open in 0.25s; bare `Popen(stdout=PIPE)`, never. `subprocess.run`
    is safe because `communicate()` drains concurrently. Redirect to a file.

16. **A test that passes while the simulation does nothing is not a test.** A
    determinism check compared two *undriven* runs and asserted `(0,0) == (0,0)`
    for weeks' worth of confidence it never earned. Assert that real work
    happened, not only that two runs agree.

17. **`--driver mock` runs no control logic.** It is a passthrough that lets a
    Python script drive tags; the logic lives in the script (`drive_engine.py`).
    An engine "driven by mock" with nothing else correctly does nothing, which
    is easy to misread as a broken scene.

18. **Never `PowerOff()` a PLCSIM instance the sidecar did not start.** The
    driver's `stop()` used to do it, so a 40-second test run switched off the
    user's CPU. Attaching to a controller is not owning it — no PowerOn, no Run,
    no PowerOff. (Recovery: `PowerOn()` then `Run()`; the downloaded program
    does survive the power cycle, but do not rely on that.)

19. **PLCSIM Advanced in Softbus mode has no IP.** The default communication
    interface is local softbus, so the virtual CPU is unreachable over the
    network and its OPC UA endpoint is not listening — whatever address the TIA
    project shows. Switch the instance to **PLCSIM Virtual Ethernet Adapter** if
    you need OPC UA or snap7; the native API driver works either way.

19b. **Driver options from `-o` arrive as strings.** `-o db 1` gives `"1"`, and a
    type hint of `db: int` does not make it one. snap7 failed with "required
    argument is not an integer", which points at ctypes and not at argparse.
    Coerce numeric options in the driver's `__init__`.

19c. **snap7's "Invalid address (0x05)" usually means the read overran the DB**,
    not that the block is optimized. FF_IO is 10 bytes; asking for 12 fails
    exactly that way. I misdiagnosed this as optimized block access and was
    wrong — check the DB's length before believing it.

19d. **A read-modify-write over S7 can stomp bits the PLC owns.** Bits are not
    individually addressable on the wire, so writing a simulator-owned bit means
    rewriting the whole byte, including any PLC-owned bits in it. FF_IO packs
    both directions into byte 0. The driver now writes the narrowest byte range
    it can; a DB you design yourself should put the two directions in separate
    bytes.

20. **The PLCSIM API assembly is not on .NET's probing path.** `clr.AddReference`
    by bare name fails on a normal install; load it by path from
    `C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Siemens\PLCSIMADV\API\<ver>\`.

21. **An exception before `GetTree().Quit()` makes the quit unreachable, and the
    condition stays true.** `Main._Process` read the sorting demo's counters
    unconditionally at the end of a `--duration` run; a scene without them threw
    there, so the run never ended and the same stack trace was logged every
    frame. An idle tank template produced a **23 MB** log and looked exactly
    like a hang — CPU busy, window responding, no output. Do the side effect
    that ends the loop *first*.

22. **Not every scene has the sorting demo's tags.** They are declared by the
    engine at startup, not owned by any part, so switching scenes calls
    `SortingTags.Undeclare`. Anything reading `conveyor.rotate` or
    `counter.tall` must check `Contains` first.

23. **Two conveyors placed end to end wedge, and it is contact slop, not your
    scene.** A rigid body resting on a static deck settles a centimetre or two
    *inside* it — that is the solver's allowed penetration and it cannot be
    tuned away. A carton riding 2 cm low then meets the vertical end face of the
    next conveyor's collider head-on and stops dead, taking the whole queue with
    it, on a belt that is visibly running. It reproduced on roughly half of the
    pick-and-place cell's runs and looked exactly like a template mistake: the
    cartons stopped at x=1.90 on a deck ending at x=2.00, with velocity 0.00 and
    the drive reporting 70 %. `ConveyorBelt.AddTransferRamps` now gives every
    deck a shallow wedge at each end, sloping from below deck level up to it, so
    a low carton rides up rather than into the face. Do not "fix" a jam like
    this by leaving a gap between belts, overlapping their decks, or holding the
    upstream drive — all three were tried, and the last one makes it *worse*
    (a carton stopped **on** the joint can never restart across it).

24. **A test that cannot see the failure mode is not coverage.** The panel had a
    correct hit test and a correct pulse dispatch and was still completely dead
    from a user's seat. Two self-tests exist for this reason — `--self-test=buttons`
    headless for the logic, `--self-test=click` with a display for the input
    path — and both were checked by deliberately reintroducing the bug and
    confirming they fail. Do that before trusting a new self-test.

25. **OpenPLC scans before its first Modbus poll returns, and until then every
    input reads FALSE.** A normally-closed E-stop that reads FALSE looks struck,
    so a program that latches a trip on `NOT PanelEstop` trips itself every time
    the runtime starts, and the grader's first Start does nothing. The guide's
    program failed exactly this way on a real OpenPLC after passing every
    Python model of it (2026-09-25, `docs/OPENPLC.md`). Arm the trip only once
    the E-stop has been seen healthy, and keep refusing Start while it reads
    FALSE, so a cut wire still stops the line. The converse also bites: when
    the Modbus link drops, OpenPLC keeps its last inputs and keeps running, so
    a line left running is already turning when the next grader connects.
    An S7-1500 does the same (2026-09-29, `examples/graded/README.md`):
    restart the controller before every graded run.

## Current state

**v1.0.0 is published.** `release.yml` built it from the `v1.0.0` tag on
2026-09-21 and attached `FactoryForge-windows.zip` and `FactoryForge-linux.zip`
to the GitHub release, after the release gate had passed against both exported
binaries (run 35566288909). Everything since the tag is on `master` and
unreleased; `git log v1.0.0..master` is the list.

**Working end to end:**

- Tag bus; drivers for OPC UA (client and server), Modbus TCP, MQTT, S7 via
  snap7, the PLCSIM Advanced native API, and a mock. `factoryforge-sidecar
  drivers` lists them.
- OPC UA client → the S7-1500 on PLCSIM Advanced → boxes sort by height
  (**100.0% perfect split: 99 tall / 99 short** with SCL v0.4). The native
  API and snap7 paths also drive the 3D scene from that virtual CPU.
- Node-RED replacing the PLC entirely — **9 tall / 9 short, perfect split**
- OpenPLC running an unmodified `examples/openplc/Sorting.st` over Modbus —
  **103 tall / 103 short**, against the Python harness scene rather than the
  3D engine (`docs/OPENPLC.md`; after v1.0.0)
- Godot C# engine with 3D geometry driven by tags, screenshot in README
- The unchanged Python sidecar drives the C# engine (`tools/drive_engine.py`)
- A headless grader, `tools/grade.py`, marks a program against a scene
  (`docs/GRADING.md`; after v1.0.0). Since IP-18 that file is a shim over the
  `factoryforge_sidecar.grading` package, one file per scene under
  `grading/scenes/` and `grading/reference/`. v1.0.0's archive lacks it;
  since IP-08 the build freezes it into `factoryforge-sidecar grade`. No real
  student's program has been graded yet (IP-11), and
  since IP-20 `tools/try_scene.py` drives every graded scene in the 3D engine
  with the grader's own reference controllers (section H, 19/19).

The MQTT driver (after v1.0.0) has only met the broker inside
`tests/test_mqtt.py`, never an external one.

**Tests:** `python -m pytest -q`, and how many pass is whatever it prints.
`python tools/test_plan.py` runs everything. CI needs no Siemens software and
no GPU, and runs the graded tests (`-m graded`) as a job of their own beside
the rest.

**Resolved imperfection:** In SCL v0.3, ~12% of tall boxes slipped past the pusher due to timing margin (0.6s catch window vs ~100ms OPC UA round-trip jitter). Fixed in SCL v0.4 by setting `PUSH_HOLD` `T#500MS` → `T#1S500MS`, verified live on real S7-1500 (99 tall / 99 short).

## Next steps, in order

Items 1–7 are done. They stay because their notes explain why things are the
way they are. Item 8 is what is next.

1. **`PUSH_HOLD` → `T#1S500MS`** (SCL v0.4) — **Verified on hardware (99 tall / 99 short, 100% split)**.
2. **Finish M2**: integer voxel grid, free-look camera, C# protocol tests in CI — **Done**.
3. **M3 — physics**: surface-velocity belt constraint, non-jittering rigid boxes, raycast sensors, pusher mechanism, emitter/remover, control panel — **Done**.
4. **M4 — Scene Editor**: part palette, place/rotate/delete with grid snapping, save/load JSON format, top toolbar, live tag forcing UI, property inspector — **Done**.
5. **M5 — Siemens Breadth**: PLCSIM Advanced Simulation Runtime API driver —
   **Done and now actually verified**: it drives the 3D scene from a real
   virtual S7-1500. It had never run before 2026-08-12; it called
   `TagTable.outputs()` and `tag.kind.value`, neither of which exists, had no
   tag→symbol mapping at all, and swallowed every resulting exception. **The
   snap7 driver had the same three API mistakes** plus an addressing scheme that
   packed every bit into byte 0 in tag order, wrapped at 8 with `% 8`, and
   ignored the DInt counters — it now takes a `DBX0.0` / `DBD2` mapping file.
   All three Siemens drivers are verified against a virtual S7-1500.
6. **M6 — v1 Release**: student getting-started guide, part & driver authoring
   guides — **Done**. **Packaging: built, verified, and published as v1.0.0.**
   Building and publishing are two different things, and this entry has been
   wrong about both of them, so read them separately.

   *Built and verified.* `python tools/build_release.py` exports the engine,
   freezes the sidecar with PyInstaller and writes
   `dist/FactoryForge-<platform>.zip`; on Windows `build_windows.bat` does the
   same double-clickably and then runs the release gate — every self-test in
   `check_release.py`'s `SELF_TESTS` list, headless, against the **exported
   binary** rather than the checkout. The gate passed on Windows and Linux in
   the v1.0.0 release run. `controlparts`, `editorkeys` and `handlingparts`
   joined the list after that run and have never met an exported binary
   (IP-22). How to ship the Python sidecar, which this entry once called
   unanswered, was answered by freezing it; see `docs/PACKAGING.md`.

   *Published.* `release.yml` triggers on `v*`. The `v1.0.0` tag fired it on
   2026-09-21, and it built both platforms, ran the gate and attached the
   archives to a GitHub release (HP-09). That archive holds no grader, and the
   guide in it never mentions OpenPLC; those are IP-08 and IP-09.

   The history is worth keeping: this entry first claimed packaging was done
   when no binary had ever been exported, then claimed it was undone after the
   machinery had been built and gated on two platforms, and then kept saying
   nothing was published after v1.0.0 had shipped. Each time the correction was
   a whole sentence away from a claim nobody had rechecked.
7. **Hardening** — `docs/HARDENING_PLAN.md`, **closed** on 2026-09-22. What it
   left open moved into the v1.1 plan. The OpenPLC/Modbus cross-check, once
   skipped at the user's request, was done there as HP-45 (`docs/OPENPLC.md`).
8. **v1.1** — `docs/IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md`. Its Sequencing section gives the
   v1.1 gate and the order to work in.

## What is open

`docs/IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md` (IP-01 … IP-41, the v1.1 plan) is the live work
list. Work paused on 2026-09-28; its **Where we stopped** section lists what
is done, what is left, and what needs the user (a firewall decision, PLCSIM
access, a review). `docs/HARDENING_PLAN.md` closed on 2026-09-22 with 53 of 56 done; its
three survivors are carried into the new plan. Every *feature*
plan in `docs/` is closed. Read the v1.1 gate in that file's Sequencing
section before starting anything: it is the list of items that must land before a
release, drawn from every phase rather than from the phase order.

## Working style the user expects

- Verify against real hardware, not models. Render a frame and look at it.
- State findings with the evidence that produced them.
- Flag your own mistakes plainly and correct them.
- Ask before writing to their PLC or touching their Node-RED install.
