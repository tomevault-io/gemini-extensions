# Beta Player

Electron + React + TypeScript desktop app for Bandcamp music with offline caching, Last.fm scrobbling, auto-updates via GitHub, and mobile/web remote control. Uses Cheerio scraping (no official Bandcamp API).

## Critical Notes

- **Shell**: Use `;` for sequential commands (PowerShell on Windows)
- **Android**: Requires OpenJDK 17 (not 24+), CMake 3.22.1. React Native matches `react` 19.1.0. Test files must be in `mobile/__tests__`.
- **IPC**: Channels in `src/shared/ipc-channels.ts`, handlers in `src/main/ipc-handlers.ts`
- **Updates**: Desktop auto-updates handled by `UpdaterService` using `electron-updater` and GitHub Releases. The app checks for updates 15 seconds after startup and every 24 hours thereafter.
- **Web Remote**: Static files in `src/assets/remote/` (index.html, client.js, styles.css). Icons injected at runtime via `RemoteService`.
- **Simulation Mode**: Run with `npm run dev:large` to simulate a large collection (5000 items) with network errors for testing scalability and resilience.
- **Mobile Standalone Mode**: Dedicated native audio engine allows the mobile app to function as an independent Bandcamp player. Supports track navigation, volume control, and background playback.
- **Hybrid Connectivity**: Mobile app maintains a background WebSocket connection to the desktop server even in Standalone mode, enabling seamless switching between Remote and local playback.
- **Scalable Collection Caching**: Large collections are persisted in SQLite with FTS5 for instant, high-performance searching. Cache refreshes daily in the background.
- **Chromecast Robustness**: `CastService` handles rapid reconnection and session de-syncs (INVALID_MEDIA_SESSION_ID) with automatic state recovery to prevent crashes.
- **Artist Collection Fetching**: Mobile app fetches the full artist collection from the server, bypassing local pagination limits to ensure all albums are visible.
- **Mobile UI**: Unified headerless design with standardized Search Bars clearing the Android camera bar. Added a **Mode Switch Badge** in the Player UI for toggling between Remote and Standalone.
- **Theme Support**: System/Light/Dark theme support with persistent settings.
- **Standalone Queue Persistence**: The mobile app saves the current track and playback queue to `AsyncStorage` on modification. Both are restored automatically upon relaunch.
- **Persistent Remote Connection**: The mobile app attempts to maintain or re-establish its WebSocket connection to the desktop server even when in Standalone mode, allowing seamless switching back to Remote.
- **Improved Player Engine**: `MobilePlayerService` supports `loadTrack` for initializing the player (track info + URL) without auto-playing. Android notifications now support Stop, Jump Forward, and Jump Backward capabilities.
- **Remote Config Pattern**: CSS selectors, regexes, and script keys used by `ScraperService` and `MobileScraperService` are defined in `remote-config.json` at the root. `RemoteConfigService` falls back to the local file but fetches the live version from GitHub `main` in the background to instantly fix broken scraping without redeployments.

## E2E Tests

- **Framework**: Playwright with custom Electron fixtures in `e2e/fixtures.ts`. Run with `npx playwright test`.
- **Toggle Switch Checkboxes**: Settings checkboxes are styled as toggle switches with `opacity: 0; width: 0; height: 0` on the `<input>`. Playwright's `setChecked()` fails with "Element is outside of the viewport". Use `evaluate(el => el.click())` instead.
- **Avoid CSS Module Selectors**: Selectors like `[class*="SettingsModal_modal"]` are fragile in Electron's production build. Prefer role-based (`getByRole`, `getByTitle`) and text-based (`locator('text=...')`, `locator('p').filter({ hasText: /regex/ })`) locators.
- **Scrollable Modals**: The Settings modal is scrollable. Elements below the fold need `scrollIntoViewIfNeeded()` on their visible label before interacting with nearby hidden inputs.
- **Radio Card Playback**: The play button overlay inside radio cards has **no onClick handler**. Only the card's root `onClick` calls `playRadioStation()`. Click the card, not the inner button.
- **Album Detail Play Button**: Multiple "Play" buttons exist (album detail + player bar). Avoid `getByRole('button', { name: 'Play', exact: true })` as it matches multiple elements.
- **Context Menus**: Right-click (`click({ button: 'right' })`) is more reliable than hover → menu button click for triggering context menus on album cards.
- **Fixture Teardown**: `fixtures.ts` teardown calls `electronApp.close()`. Tests that close and relaunch the app (persistence tests) cause double-close. The teardown wraps `.close()` in try/catch.
- **Checkbox Ordering**: Settings checkboxes by `getByRole('checkbox').nth(n)`: 0=Enable Caching, 1=Minimize to Tray, 2=Start Minimized, 3=Show Notifications, 4=Enable Remote Control.
- **Back Button Navigation**: The Back button in album detail view needs an explicit visibility wait before clicking — it's not immediately available after navigation.
- **Audio Streaming**: Real Bandcamp audio streaming doesn't work in the E2E test environment. Tests should verify UI state (station cards, track info) rather than actual playback.
- **Zustand State Injection**: In E2E tests, `window.evaluate` on `useStore` only works if the store is globally exposed. An alternative is dispatching `CustomEvent` or mocking IPC methods like `window.electron.cast.getDevices`.
- **Obstructed Elements**: Electron UI elements near absolute-positioned sliders or overlays (like in the PlayerBar) may require `{ force: true }` or `element.evaluate(el => el.click())` if Playwright thinks they are obstructed.
- **Native Module Rebuilds**: If E2E tests fail with "The specified module could not be found" (e.g., `better-sqlite3`), run `npm rebuild` or delete `node_modules` and re-install to ensure native bindings match the Electron version.
- **V8 Coverage Merging**: When generating E2E coverage from V8 data, ensure hits from *all* test runs are merged. Filtering by unique `scriptId` across different JSON files can lead to 0% reporting if the same bundled script (e.g., `index.js`) is targetted by different tests with varying coverage requirements.
- **Strict Mode violations**: `getByTitle` and `getByLabel` can easily match multiple elements if titles are substrings (e.g., "Queue" matching both a "Queue" toggle and a "Clear queue" button). Always use `{ exact: true }` or scope lookups to parent containers (e.g., `locator('footer')` or `locator('div[class*="playerBar"]')`).
- **Conditional Toggling**: When testing UI panels (Queue, Settings, Playlists), avoid blind clicks. Check if the panel is already open (e.g., via `classList.contains('active')`) to prevent the test from accidentally closing it.
- **Robust Item Counting**: When adding albums to the queue, the number of tracks can vary. Use `expect(count).toBeGreaterThan(0)` or loop through items instead of hardcoding expected counts (like `toHaveCount(1)`), unless the mock data is strictly fixed.

## Mobile Test Learnings

- **State Isolation**: Zustand stores and `AsyncStorage` can leak state between tests. Always use `useStore.setState()` to reset critical connection flags (`connectionStatus`, `hostIp`, `skipAutoLogin`) in `beforeEach` or before specific tests.
- **`act()` with `RefreshControl`**: Triggering pull-to-refresh on `VirtualizedList` via `props.onRefresh()` requires an explicit `act(async () => ...)` block, even if using `waitFor` for assertions, to avoid VirtualizedList state update warnings.
- **`expo-router` Mock Extension**: The default mock in `jest.setup.js` must include `useFocusEffect` (as a no-op or implementation-caller) to support screens that refresh data on focus (e.g., Artists screen).
- **Asynchronous Synchronization**: `connect()` calls that update the store should be `await`ed within the store logic, and tests should use `waitFor()` for assertions on state values that are updated asynchronously (like `hostIp`).
- **Mock Implementation Leakage**: When methods (e.g., `play()`) fetch data multiple times (like calling `useStore.getState()` or `TrackPlayer.getQueue()`), using `mockReturnValueOnce()` or `mockResolvedValueOnce()` restricts the mock to the first invocation only, causing subsequent internal calls to return default/undefined states and failing the test. Only use `*Once` mock modifiers when specifically testing sequential behavior differences; use `mockReturnValue()` and `mockResolvedValue()` by default.
- **Mock Cleanup Isolation**: Use `jest.clearAllMocks()` alongside `jest.restoreAllMocks()` inside `beforeEach()` to fully reset mocked implementations (like `jest.spyOn`) and prevent test bleeding.
- **Partial Type Mocking**: When partial objects are supplied as mocks to complex type parameters (e.g., passing `{ id, streamUrl }` to a `Track` parameter), you can safely cast it using `track as any` or `as unknown as Track` in unit tests, provided the inner logic only interacts with those specific properties.

## Desktop Test Learnings

- **HTMLAudioElement Mocks**: In the `jsdom`/`happydom` environment, simulated `<audio>` elements have a `duration` of `NaN` by default. If a test relies on the duration being a number (e.g., for `timeUpdate` events), explicitly mock it using `Object.defineProperty(audio, 'duration', { value: 100, configurable: true });` before triggering the event.
- **Vitest Node Environment**: Tests requiring Node.js core modules (like `http`, `dgram`, `os`, `ws`) should explicitly set `/** @vitest-environment node */` at the top of the file to ensure the correct environment is used.
- **Mocking HTTP Servers**: When mocking `http.createServer` in unit tests, capture the request handler passed to it by intercepting the `listen` method (or saving it during `createServer()`). This allows you to manually invoke the handler with mocked `Request` and `Response` objects to accurately test HTTP route/serving logic.
- **Mocking WebSocketServer (ws)**: When mocking the `ws` module, explicitly manage the `wss.clients` Set. Use an `EventEmitter` for the server and listen for the `connection` event to add the mock `ws` client to the `clients` Set. The client's `close` event should remove it from the Set, and `wss.close()` should call `wss.clients.clear()`. This prevents broadcast test failures caused by stale connections leaking across tests.

## Rules

- **Java Version**: Ensure `JAVA_HOME` points to Java 17 for Android builds. Java 24+ is NOT supported.
- **ESM Imports Only**: Never use CommonJS `require()` in TypeScript files.
- **Mobile Tests**: Place all mobile unit tests in `mobile/__tests__/` to avoid bundling errors with Expo Router.
- After implementing new features, always ensure that the lints and tests pass or are updated to reflect the new behavior
- After implementing new features, judge if they need tests, and if so - create them
- **No Preamble for Safe Commands**: Do not ask for permission or explain that you are about to run read-only/safe commands e.g. `git status`, `ls`, `npm test`, `npx vitest`, `npm run lint`, `npx tsc`, `eslint src`, `eslint mobile`, `npx jest`, `jest`, `npx vitest`, `npx vitest run`, and similar, or starting with the provided. Execute them immediately and only report the output.
- Always set `SafeToAutoRun: true` for any command that runs tests, linters, or type checks e.g. `npm test`, `npx vitest`, `npm run lint`, `npx tsc`, `eslint src`, `eslint mobile`, `npx jest`, `npx vitest`, `npx vitest run`, `jest`, and similar.
- Always set `SafeToAutoRun: true` for read-only/informational commands like `ls`, `dir`, `cat`, `type`, `pwd`, `git diff`, and similar.
- Do not git add automatically after changing something.
- Always update the GEMINI.md file with the new knowledge when you learn something during creating and fixing tests.
- When you are creating txt files for testing purposes, make sure to write them in the `test_logs` folder.
- Use JSON for test coverage reports, e.g. mobile: `npx jest --coverage --coverageReporters="json-summary"`, desktop: `npx vitest --coverage --coverage.reporter="json-summary"`. For multiple Vitest reporters, pass the flag multiple times: `--coverage.reporter=text --coverage.reporter=json-summary`.
- To release new version (bump version, copy assets, run tests, commit, and tag)
npm run release <newVersion>.
- when running a command in terminal that has `(tabs)` somewhere in the path, remember to use proper quotes to avoid errors.
