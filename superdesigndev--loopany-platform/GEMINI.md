# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

**Loopany** - multi-user scheduled **agent loops**. The server (TanStack Start)
schedules/stores/authenticates/notifies; execution is **BYOA** - claude-code runs on
each user's own machine via the `@crewlet/loopany` daemon. **Zero-exec invariant:
the server runs no LLM and executes no user code** - it only stores/reads bytes and
computes pure functions. Run instructions: `README.md`.

## Layout (pnpm monorepo)

- `packages/server` (`@loopany/server`) - TanStack Start UI + server fns +
  in-process Scheduler (croner) + machine routes + Better Auth + push notifications.
  Drizzle over Postgres (tiered driver: embedded pglite when `DATABASE_URL` is
  unset, postgres-js on Supabase when set).
  - `src/scheduler/` - cron engine (tick -> pending run -> Dispatcher).
  - `src/gateway/` - machine gateway (`index.ts`: `MachineGateway`, the
    poll/report run-lifecycle core + owner verbs + retention/GC; `cli.ts`:
    `CliGateway`, the credential-keyed CLI dispatch for /api/machine/cli +
    /agent-api/loop; `validate.ts`: the ONE ui/workflow/schema validator module
    both write surfaces import; `sync.ts`: `ArtifactSync`, the sync/blob byte
    ingress - boot shares ONE blob store between the classes), run tokens,
    delivery, prompt, notify, blobstore (R2/in-memory), artifacts.
  - `src/db/` - Drizzle schema
    (machines/loops/runs/blobs/artifact_files/run_snapshots/run_leases/connect_keys)
    + store + auth-schema.
  - `src/server/` - boot (`ensureServer`), adapters (Loop/Run -> JobSummary/JobDetail),
    loopApi server fns.
  - `src/skill/` - ALL prompt/skill prose (see "The skill" below).
  - `src/routes/` - pages + server-only route files.
- `packages/daemon` (`@crewlet/loopany`) - one binary, two roles: poll-loop daemon
  and the in-run `loopany` callback; spawns claude.

## Commands

- `pnpm dev` - server on :3000 (UI + scheduler + machine routes).
- `pnpm -r typecheck` - both packages (server typecheck runs `tsr generate` first,
  so a fresh checkout typechecks with no prior build).
- `pnpm --filter @loopany/server test` / `pnpm --filter @crewlet/loopany test` -
  vitest; single file: append the path; single test: `vitest run -t "<name>"`.
- `pnpm --filter @loopany/server db:generate` / `db:migrate` - Drizzle migrations.
- `bash scripts/demo-cookie-unified.sh` - e2e demo loop through the unified server.
- Prod: nitro build, then `pnpm start` = `scripts/prestart.mjs` +
  `node .output/server/index.mjs`. prestart applies pending migrations via the
  postgres-js migrator over `DIRECT_DATABASE_URL` for the hosted Supabase tier
  (when `DATABASE_URL` is set; fails loud if that would route DDL over the :6543
  pooler); the embedded pglite tier migrates in-process at boot - prestart just
  gates it (no `DATABASE_URL` requires the explicit `LOOPANY_DB=pglite` opt-in,
  exit 1 otherwise, so a lost DB secret can't silently boot an empty pglite).

## Core model

- Scheduler tick creates a pending run; the bound machine's **HTTP poll** claims
  it (stateless, not WS: an IDLE daemon opts into a server-held long-poll -
  `wait:true`, ~20s hold, the Dispatcher wakes it on a new pending run for
  near-zero dispatch latency; with a run in flight it stays the classic ~3s
  short poll so the progress heartbeat flows; old daemons/servers degrade to
  plain short-poll on both sides); the daemon spawns claude; the agent talks back via
  run-token verbs (`loopany report/show/set-*/reschedule/finish`, `/agent-api/loop`);
  the final `report()` persists transcript/metrics/artifacts and retires the run lease.
- Run roles: `exec` (scheduled run), `evolve` (self-improvement pass), `edit`
  (owner-requested change). Only exec runs produce user-facing notifications,
  success or failure.
- **Open vs closed loops**: closed-ness derives from `loops.goal != null` (no kind
  column). A closed loop's exec run gets `canFinish` and may call `loopany finish`
  when the goal is met, stamping `completedAt`/`completionReason` + `enabled=false`.
  The invariant `completedAt != null implies goal != null` is enforced at the single
  write chokepoint `store.updateLoop`, which also runs lifecycle side effects for
  every caller: `goal:null` clears completion stamps; `enabled:true` on a completed
  loop is a reopen; `enabled:false` is a plain pause.
- A loop's standing brief lives ONLY in its task file's `## Spec` (there is no
  `task` column). The exec run's instructions live ENTIRELY in the first user turn
  (`buildExecTask` ← `skill/run/exec-core.md`): the self-sufficient CORE (identity +
  untrusted-data guard + the non-negotiable fallback core - read task file first, do
  the work / surface only what changed, end with exactly ONE `loopany report`/`finish`,
  `{{stateLine}}` report grammar, one pass then stop + per-run trigger + a pointer to
  the installable loopany skill for the deep protocol). `buildLoopSystemPrompt` returns
  `""`; on an OLD daemon `--append-system-prompt-file` then points at an empty file (a
  harmless no-op, so batches 1-2 shipped server-first with no daemon change), and the
  current daemon skips the flag entirely when the delivered `systemPrompt` is empty (the
  batch-5 `runner.ts` note under "Daemon gotchas"). A closed loop's goal is prompt-injected
  as `Goal (finish line): <goal>` (an own-line fill, `{{goalLine}}`). The old standing
  system prompt `skill/run/exec-loop.md` is retained as the source for the later
  skill-side `references/run.md` batch but is no longer imported or delivered.
- The EVOLVE and EDIT runs follow the SAME first-user-turn model (Batch 2):
  `buildEvolvePrompt`/`buildEditPrompt` both return `""` (empty system prompt, same
  harmless-no-op rationale as exec), and the standing prose ships in the user turn -
  `buildEvolveTask` concatenates `references/evolve.md` ahead of its payload,
  `buildEditTask` concatenates the short `run/edit.md` CORE ahead of its payload. The
  untrusted-data guard rides along in that prose (evolve reads run messages; edit reads
  the loop's current config - both untrusted). `buildEvolveTask` no longer dumps up to
  12 runs as pretty-printed JSON; it emits a COMPACT one-line-per-run survey
  (`renderRecentRuns`: ts / role / outcome-status / cost as `$x.xx` / state KEYS only,
  not values / FULL session id so the `find … <session>.jsonl` deep-dive resolves /
  message collapsed + clipped to ~100 chars), headed by on-demand pointers
  (`loopany log [--transcript]`, now reachable in-run, + the local session JSONL).
  `buildEditTask` KEEPS its inlined current ui/workflow/schema - that is current CONFIG,
  not history, and is useful for a surgical edit.
- `allowControl` defaults TRUE; `false` means the owner pins the schedule. A run's
  self-schedule surface is only `reschedule` + `set-cron`, with cadence floors
  (`LOOPANY_SELF_CRON_FLOOR_MINUTES`, `LOOPANY_SELF_RESCHEDULE_FLOOR_MINUTES`)
  applying to the run path ONLY - owner `loopany edit` is unlimited.

## The skill (`packages/server/src/skill/`)

- ALL prompt prose lives here, split by audience:
  1. `bootstrap.md` - first-contact onboarding, served at `/api/bootstrap`; never
     bundled or installed.
  2. `SKILL.md` + `references/{create,update,evolve,run}.md` - the PUBLIC installable
     skill, bundled into the daemon npm package and auto-installed at USER scope for
     EVERY coding agent loopany knows about (`SKILL_TARGET_AGENTS` in
     `daemon/src/skill-install.ts` - Claude Code `~/.claude/skills/loopany` + Codex
     `~/.agents/skills/loopany` today), via `npx skills add ... -a claude-code -a codex -g`
     (repeated `-a` flags per agent; the comma form `-a a,b` is an invalid single
     name, and `-a '*'` is deliberately avoided since it litters all ~72 supported
     agents regardless of presence) on `loopany up`/`new`; best-effort, never blocks.
     `installArgs` + `loopany skill status` both derive from `SKILL_TARGET_AGENTS`, so
     adding an agent is a one-line list edit.
  3. `skill/run/{exec-core,edit}.md` - INTERNAL run prompts, imported `?raw` by
     `gateway/prompt.ts`; never served, never bundled. `exec-core.md` is the exec
     run's full first-user-turn CORE (folds the former `exec-trigger.md`, deleted);
     the former standing prompt `exec-loop.md` still sits in `skill/run/` (Batch-3
     source for `references/run.md`) but is imported by nothing. `run/edit.md`
     stays SEPARATE from `references/update.md` on purpose: the edit RUN uses
     run-token verbs on the current loop (`loopany set-cron`/`set-ui` ..., no id)
     and must be self-contained (skill install is best-effort), while update.md is
     the OWNER authoring CLI (`loopany edit <id> --json`) - a merge would ship
     run-token instructions in the public bundle.
- `references/evolve.md` doubles as the evolve RUN prompt (same `?raw` import), so
  skill and run-dispatch cannot drift. `references/run.md` is the PUBLIC runtime
  protocol (dual-audience: in-run enrichment + owner docs) - the depth extracted
  from `run/exec-loop.md` §1-§4 (task-file discipline, report/finish grammar + finish
  bar, schedule levers, front-matter conventions); the server-injected exec CORE stays
  authoritative and self-sufficient, so run.md is enrichment, never a dependency.
- **HARD GUARDRAIL**: `packages/daemon/scripts/sync-skill.mjs` is a SELECTIVE
  whitelist copy (exactly `SKILL.md` + the 4 references). Never make it recursive -
  that would ship the internal run prompts and `bootstrap.md` into the public npm
  tarball. Guarded by `sync-skill.test.ts`. Edit the source files; never fork
  the content. `packages/daemon/skill/` is generated + gitignored.
- References are also served at `/api/skill/references/<file>` (static map, only
  the 4 exact names resolve; in dev vite's static layer 404s the `.md` path - the
  handler works in prod, covered by unit test).
- Skill/prompt markdown compiles INTO the server bundle via `?raw` imports, so a
  prompt-only `.md` edit MUST deploy (`deploy.yml` paths-ignore lists explicit doc
  paths, deliberately not a wholesale `**/*.md`).

## Template market (`packages/server/src/skill/templates/` + `skill/bundles/`)

- A template is a **canned loop INTENT expressed as the paste-prompt** the user copies
  from a template card (`ComposeModal` appends `description` under the connect-key config;
  the agent fetches `/api/bootstrap` and builds from it). **Division of responsibility:**
  `bootstrap.md` + `references/create.md` own the GENERAL loop-building mechanism —
  propose-then-confirm cadence, config, task-file + dashboard authoring, the
  zero-exec/worktree/front-matter disciplines — identical for every loop; the template
  `description` owns THIS loop's SPECIFICS — the per-run workflow, the hard rules, the
  boundaries and quality gates that make it actually work well. **Spell the specifics out
  in the description; do NOT rely on create.md to reconstruct them.** Bulky per-template
  detail (a validated dashboard layout, a state schema, an artifact contract) goes in an
  ON-DEMAND `reference.md` (below), fetched only when the create flow needs it.
- Each template is a **folder** under `skill/templates/<name>/` with a static
  `meta.json` (the `TemplateInfo`: `name`, `label`, `desc` = one-line card blurb,
  `description` = the paste-prompt task text) and an OPTIONAL `reference.md` served
  on-demand at `/api/skill/references/templates/<name>/reference.md`
  (`routes/api.skill.references.$.ts`, static glob; ONLY `reference.md` is exposed —
  `meta.json`/`thumb.svg` stay off that route, pinned by `-api.skill.references.test.ts`).
  Zero-exec, file-based.
- **Adding a template is content addition + ONE bundle line.** The registry
  (`server/templates.ts`) builds `TEMPLATES` from an `import.meta.glob` over `meta.json`,
  pairs each folder's optional `thumb.svg` (`?raw`), and merges the editorial `rating`
  from `server/templateRatings.ts`; `listTemplates` returns that flat list (its only
  consumer left is the onboarding wizard's Housekeeper lookup). Every user-facing surface
  reads BUNDLES instead, so a template in no bundle is INVISIBLE - name it in a bundle
  meta too. Shape tests (`templates.test.ts`, `bundles.test.ts`, `templateRatings.test.ts`)
  then cover the new folder automatically.
- **Bundles** (`skill/bundles/<name>/meta.json` -> `server/bundles.ts`) are curated
  categories, same file-based/zero-exec mirror of the template system: `BundleInfo` =
  label + tagline + `accent` + the member template NAMES in display order, plus
  `individual: true` for the catch-all "Goal Loops" (bundle name `others`: individually
  created, goal-bound loops - renders NO bundle CTA). `listBundles` resolves members to
  their `TemplateInfo`s in a curated broad-appeal-first 6-category order (Growth ->
  Business Ops -> Codebase Autopilot [`code-health`] -> CI, Test & Security
  [`ship-with-confidence`] -> Personal -> Goal Loops [`others`]; bundle NAME keys never changed, only
  labels/taglines - tests key on names). An accent is a `--color-<accent>` token and
  deliberately never a red/alarm hue (a category must not read as an error state);
  CI, Test & Security uses the calm `--color-indigo`, declared in a plain `:root` and NOT `@theme` because Tailwind
  v4 tree-shakes a var that only appears in a runtime inline style.
  **Every template belongs to EXACTLY ONE bundle** - pinned by `bundles.test.ts`.
- **Dashboard entry**: the hero renders `components/BundleCarousel.tsx` - an auto-playing
  plain slide carousel (one bundle in focus, prev/next arrows, pager dots; pauses on
  hover/focus and permanently after a manual nav; `prefers-reduced-motion` disables both
  auto-play and the slide tween; arrow keys are scoped to the carousel root and stand down
  while a dialog is open). The in-bundle loop-card fan wraps fill-first in rows of up to 3
  (`splitRows`: 5 -> 3+2, 4 -> 3+1). Clicking one card opens `ComposeModal` with that
  `template`; "Try this bundle" opens it with the `bundle`, whose snippet is a
  self-contained candidate menu built by `lib/bundlePrompt.ts` - bundle mode never
  auto-closes, since one conversation yields several loops. `ComposeModal` handles ALL
  THREE shapes (blank = the two-step rail, `template`, `bundle`) - there is no separate
  modal. Template/bundle snippets skip the host chooser and share the blank loop's
  connect-key machinery (`mintClaim`/`getConfig`/`claimStatus`); the single-template form
  is `Fetch <origin>/api/bootstrap and help me build a loop.` + `server-url`/`connect-key`
  + a blank line + the `description`.
- **Public market** (`routes/templates.tsx` + `routes/templates_.$slug.tsx`): `/templates`
  and the shareable `/templates/<slug>` do ZERO auth checks BY DESIGN - there is no global
  auth middleware (each route gates itself), so these render logged out under the login
  gate - and they SSR (the app-wide `ssr: false` exists only because other loaders need
  the session cookie) so crawlers and unfurlers get real HTML. They read
  `listPublicBundles`/`getPublicTemplate`: the same registry MINUS every inlined
  `thumb.svg` - the market draws no illustration (a card's visual anchor is its
  When -> Does -> You-get flow strip from the rating table; whole-card click to the
  detail route, quiet hover-revealed "Create"; the FULL prompt lives only on the detail
  page). `/templates` is a marketplace layout: centered hero (count badge, stacked
  same-size pixel headline whose gray second line TYPES through `TYPED_PHRASES` -
  SSR renders the first phrase statically, client-only effect, off under
  reduced-motion), client-side search filter, category chips that scroll-jump, then
  per-bundle SECTIONS fully expanded (no View-all; section headers carry the label +
  tagline — deliberately no accent bar — so cards there pass `showCategory={false}`). Detail resolves BY SLUG (`findPublicTemplate`) since the grid preloads on
  hover; an unknown slug throws `notFound()` for a real HTTP 404. **The slug IS the
  template folder name and there is no alias/redirect map**, so renaming a folder
  permanently 404s the old `/templates/<old>` share link and the `/?template=<old>`
  deep link — rename only a young/unshared template, otherwise change the `label`
  and leave the folder alone. The detail page is a
  SPLIT layout: LEFT = the flow diagram, the mechanism facts COLLAPSED under it (native
  `<details>`, SSR-safe), and optional "Field notes" — a repo-authored
  `skill/templates/<name>/story.md` (real results/learnings write-up) attached ONLY by
  `findPublicTemplate` (never on list payloads) and rendered through marked WITHOUT
  DOMPurify (trusted repo content, and DOMPurify needs a DOM the SSR pass lacks). Story
  MEDIA lives in `public/template-assets/<name>/` (nitro serves `public/` verbatim in
  dev AND prod; `templateStory` rewrites relative `assets/<file>` refs to
  `/template-assets/<name>/…`) — deliberately NOT Vite `?url` assets, whose SSR-emitted
  `/assets/<hash>` URLs the nitro build never serves (the 2026-07-29 prod 404s);
  RIGHT = the sticky verbatim prompt + Copy. Its CTA deep-links
  `/?template=<name>`, which is forwarded through the gated `/t/<team>` redirect and
  preserved across OAuth via `callbackURL`, then reuses the EXISTING single-template
  compose through `DashboardView.openTemplate` - never a parallel creation path.
- **The market CARD is ONE shared component** (`components/TemplateCard.tsx`:
  `TemplateCard` + `bundleItems`; the card body is the When/Does/You-get `FlowStrip`
  fed by `rating.schedule`/`does`/`outcome` - `server/templateRatings.ts` owns those 23
  copy lines), rendered by THREE surfaces:
  `/templates`, and the catalog teaser `components/TemplatesPreview.tsx` on BOTH the
  dashboard and the pre-login landing. The teaser opens with the SAME typed hero as the
  market (`AgentLoopsHeadline`, exported from `TemplatesPage` — compact size for the
  band) and previews the FIRST `PREVIEW_COUNT = 9` templates in the CATALOG's own
  curated bundle order (Growth first — the same sequence the market shows, never a
  re-curated shuffle) = three desktop rows under `.templates-peek`, a fixed `max-height` + bottom mask: TWO rows
  solid, the THIRD under the fade, then "Browse all N templates" (N = the WHOLE
  catalog). The card height (252px), the box (642px) and the mask stop (81%) are
  COUPLED — change one, change all three (pinned by `TemplatesPreview.test.ts`, which
  derives the formula from source). `PEEK_VISIBILITY` `display: none`s the cards a
  narrower column count would push entirely under the clip (3/6/9 at 1/2/3 columns);
  the box uses `overflow-clip`, not `hidden`, so it is never a scroll container.
  Data source differs by surface: the dashboard passes the
  loader's static `bundles` (never re-polled), while `SignIn` fetches `listPublicBundles`
  itself (thumb-stripped, public) rather than threading it through the eight gated routes
  that render it - best-effort, since an empty registry renders no band.
- **The pre-login landing IS `components/SignIn.tsx`** (`SignIn.landing.test.ts`): value
  line + Continue-with-GitHub, then the template teaser, then the playbook - not a bare
  card. Every gated route renders it signed-out, so a change here is the signed-out
  experience everywhere; both bands' CTAs scroll back to the sign-in card. Reviewing it
  locally needs the GATE ON - `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`/`_SECRET` (any non-empty value; see
  `lib/loginGate.ts`) plus `LOOPANY_AUTH_SECRET`, or the app boots open-mode and lands
  straight on the dashboard.
- **Per-template FLOW SPECS live in `lib/templateFlow.tsx`** (extracted from
  `components/LoopFlow.tsx`, which now imports them): ONE source, two surfaces - the
  compose modal's animated vertical preview (`LoopFlow`, `hasLoopFlow`) and the public
  detail page's STATIC diagram (`components/TemplateFlowDiagram.tsx` on
  `/templates/<slug>`). The static one is DERIVED, never a second hand-authored list:
  `templateFlowDiagram(name)` folds a `FlowSpec` into trigger -> steps -> outputs (steps
  from `nodes`, the `setup` gate split off, `closes` from a `finish` node, outputs from
  the dashboard WIDGETS the loop maintains, typed by widget kind). It must stay
  hook-free/measurement-free - that route SSRs for crawlers, and the guard test pins it.
  A template with no spec renders NEITHER surface (all 23 shipping templates have one);
  add a spec rather than invent a flow.
- **Editorial ratings** (`server/templateRatings.ts`, one typed table merged onto
  `TemplateInfo.rating`) drive the market's rating chips and the detail view's mechanism
  rows: ease, cadence + mechanism, effect visibility, plus a humanized `schedule` and -
  for a CLOSED loop only - an `exitCondition`. `mechanism` REUSES the catalog's open/closed
  distinction (the `individual` "Others" bundle is exactly the closed set);
  `templateRatings.test.ts` fails a template that lacks a rating or misclassifies it.
- **PUBLIC but NOT bundled.** `meta.json` rides to the client via `listBundles`/
  `listPublicBundles`, and `sync-skill.mjs`'s whitelist stays selective (neither
  `skill/templates/` nor `skill/bundles/` ever ships in the daemon npm tarball; guarded by
  `sync-skill.test.ts`).
- **A template `description` SHOULD spell out the specifics that make the loop work** —
  the per-run workflow, the hard rules, the boundaries and quality gates — as a guided
  multi-step setup conversation (`## Step` headers, confirm-each-step-before-creating),
  and, where the loop keeps a task file, **embed the task-file skeleton to author** (with
  `<placeholders>` the create flow fills). Don't leave the specifics to create.md, and
  don't settle for a tight one-paragraph blurb; some older short-paragraph templates
  predate this and are lighter. English only. `templates.test.ts` pins the full name list
  AND asserts each template's defining behaviors stay in its description.
- **New-template SOP — TWO required pieces plus four optional ones:**
  (1) `meta.json` — the paste-prompt `description`: a guided multi-step setup conversation
  (verify-before-create gates → the loop's rules / boundaries / quality gates → optionally
  the task-file skeleton to author). (2) membership in exactly one `skill/bundles/*`
  meta + an entry in `server/templateRatings.ts` (without either the template ships
  invisible / fails its shape test). (3) OPTIONAL `reference.md` — bulky detail fetched on
  demand: the artifact contract, the REAL dashboard layout markup (`loop-kanban`/`loop-chart`/
  `loop-embed`), the metric state schema. (4) OPTIONAL `thumb.svg` — the folder-paired card
  thumbnail, hand-drawn in the dashboard/flow visual language (data-mock/flow art on theme
  vars, any brand logo in its real color - NOT a centered icon); the carousel renders it,
  the public market does not. (5) OPTIONAL **loop-flow
  + dashboard PREVIEW** — a `FlowSpec` registered in `lib/templateFlow.tsx` `FLOWS` (nodes +
  dashboard widgets, pure data; `hasLoopFlow(name)` flips the modal to its two-column layout
  and renders the Loop-flow / Dashboard tabs; the SAME spec draws the public detail page's
  static diagram - see the flow-spec bullet above). **The LOOP FLOW and the DASHBOARD are
  the CARD VISUAL in (5) + what create.md/`reference.md` actually author — NOT sections the
  paste-prompt must enumerate.** (6) OPTIONAL `story.md` - the public detail page's "Field
  notes"; see the public-market bullet above for the render path and the
  `public/template-assets/<name>/` media rule.
- **The shipping catalog is the folder list under `skill/templates/`** (23 across the 6
  bundles); each template's defining behaviors are owned by its own `meta.json`
  `description` and pinned per-template by `templates.test.ts` - read those, never a
  summary here. The house disciplines that recur across them, and that a NEW template
  should carry unless it has a reason not to: verify a CONCRETE observation path (and
  smoke-test it once) before creating, never a blind loop; do code work in a fresh
  worktree off `main` and land it as a PR, one at a time, no stacking while a prior PR is
  unmerged; never manufacture activity - nothing found is a clean stop; one dated
  `type: report` product per run (or `type:`-tagged kanban cards) plus one metric; author
  the day-one dashboard at create; never copy credentials/tokens/PII into a report or PR.

## Workflows (deterministic pre-stage)

- A loop's workflow is an **async function body, NOT an ES module**: top-level
  `await` + `return {message?, state?}` are legal; top-level `export`/`import` is a
  parse error (the daemon wraps the body in an async arrow inside a generated ESM
  file run by bare node). Enforced at write time by `validateWorkflow` (AsyncFunction
  constructor compile-only check) on all three write paths: createLoop, editLoop,
  and run-token `set-workflow`. No dialect tolerance (never strip `export`).
- `await tools.call("server.tool", args)` calls the machine's own MCP servers via
  mcporter (headless, `disableOAuth: true` - never launches a browser flow). The
  bridge `packages/daemon/src/mcp-bridge.mjs` is plain ESM on purpose (the workflow
  subprocess runs bare node, dev and prod); `scripts/copy-runtime-assets.mjs` ships
  it to `dist/`. Caps + timeout via `LOOPANY_WORKFLOW_TOOL_*` env.
- A failed workflow does NOT fail the run: `runner.ts` falls back to the agent with
  the original task + failure context. A `/SyntaxError/` failure is a user-fix case
  (exec runs have no `set-workflow`) - the agent writes `workflow-setup-<date>.md`
  and surfaces a one-line owner prompt. The workflow cursor never advances on failure.

## Artifacts / storage

- The daemon watcher (chokidar) syncs each loop's folder: full sha256 manifest
  (deletions = absence) -> `POST /api/machine/sync` (device token, not run token) ->
  server replies `needHashes` -> `PUT /api/machine/blob/:hash` (server verifies the
  hash). The manifest is always FULL but hashing is INCREMENTAL (`watcher.ts`
  `buildManifest`): a stat cache (size+mtime+ctime, git-index-style racy-write
  guard) means unchanged files are never re-read; bytes are re-read + re-verified
  only when the server wants them (never buffered per-flush); PUTs run
  4-concurrent; a rebuild whose digest matches the last acked sync skips the
  network entirely. Inline blobs (≤64KB each) are budgeted 1MB aggregate per POST
  (a burst must never 413 the server's 32MB `SYNC_BODY_CAP`; overflow takes the
  PUT path), and the FIRST flush after watcher start inlines nothing
  (post-restart the server already has almost everything). Bytes live in R2
  (`LOOPANY_R2_*`; in-memory store when unset - the test/dev
  default), metadata in `blobs`/`artifact_files`. The **never-syncable dir** list
  (`.git`, `node_modules`, `.worktrees`, common build/tool caches, `.loopany`) +
  `.env*`/key files is enforced on BOTH daemon (`watcher.ts` `IGNORE_DIRS`) and
  server (`gateway/artifacts.ts` `IGNORE_DIRS`) - keep the two in sync. Per-file
  cap 10MB (larger = metadata-only `oversize`).
- **A loop folder is a synced CONTENT home, not a scratch workspace** (the
  2026-07-07 prod incident: a run dropped a 1.3GB/125k-file git worktree in the
  loop dir and flooded sync). Two defenses: (1) the never-syncable dirs above
  exclude a checkout/worktree/build tree at the source; (2) `watcher.ts`
  `capManifest` bounds every sync to a per-loop file-count + byte ceiling
  (`LOOPANY_SYNC_MAX_FILES` 5000 / `LOOPANY_SYNC_MAX_BYTES` 256MB) - over either,
  it keeps the shallowest-then-smallest files (the top-level content home always
  survives) and DROPS the overflow with ONE loud warning, so the bounded POST
  can't 413/timeout into an endless retry storm. The SKILL teaches runs to keep
  heavy work OUT of the loop folder (`skill/run/exec-core.md` non-negotiable +
  `references/run.md` §1 + `create.md` §3 + the worktree templates).
- `run_snapshots` capture the manifest at `report()`; `getRunDiff` diffs run N vs
  the prior snapshot (jsdiff) for the run page's "Changes".
- **Byte serving** (`routes/api.artifact.$loopId.$.ts`, session-authed, `loopInScope`):
  default disposition is `attachment` (download); `?view=inline` on a KNOWN image
  (`lib/artifactKind.ts` `imageMime` allowlist) serves the real image content-type
  `inline` + `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` + `Content-Security-Policy: sandbox`
  (so a direct hit on an inline SVG can't script the origin). **DEV GOTCHA: `pnpm dev`
  (vite) intercepts asset-extension paths (`.png/.svg/.md/...`) BEFORE the SSR route
  and 404s them** ("Cannot GET …"), so image rendering only works against a nitro
  PROD build (`pnpm build && pnpm start`, `PORT=…` not `LOOPANY_PORT`); markdown is
  unaffected (it reads via the `getArtifact` server fn, not this route). Verify image
  serving against prod, not dev.
- **Front-matter convention** (migration `0018`, `blobs.meta`): markdown products
  MAY open with a fenced `---` block of flat `key: value` scalars; the indexed
  subset `{type?, title?, date?}` is parsed once at byte ingress (both `sync()`
  inline and `putBlob`; `server/frontmatter.ts` - pure, bounded, never throws) and
  stored on the blob row (dedup reuses the first parse; old blobs stay `meta` null,
  no backfill). A SOFT convention (prompt + UI incentive, never a sync/storage
  gate). Front-matter `date:` is the AUTHORITATIVE product date
  (`lib/productDate.ts`); filename date is the fallback, sync time last. UI:
  `LoopFilesPanel` type/title chips (task file exempt, keeps its TASK treatment).
- Retention/GC (`gateway/retention.ts`, periodic `maintainStorage` with an in-flight
  latch): snapshot pruning (keep 20) unpins old blobs; blob GC computes a live
  keep-set, honors a 1h grace window, re-checks referencedness per candidate, and
  deletes bytes BEFORE metadata (never leaves a live `blobs` row pointing at deleted
  bytes). Bias: when in doubt KEEP (a leaked blob is a cost bug; a wrong delete is
  data loss). Per-loop 500MB cap enforced at `sync()` AND authoritatively at
  `putBlob` (real byte length; also handshake-gated - only accepts hashes the sync
  asked THIS machine for, so a device token is not an uncapped write channel).
  `store.deleteLoop` cascades runs/run_leases/artifact_files/run_snapshots.

## Security / hardening invariants

- Wire boundary: `gateway/http.ts` `readJsonBody` caps machine-route bodies at 2MB
  (413). Per-field caps (`WIRE_TEXT_CAP` 512KB, `MESSAGE_CAP` 2000, ...) are
  row-bloat budgets, not the security boundary.
- The device token fully impersonates the machine; it is serialized OWNER-ONLY
  (`tokenVisibleTo`) - teammates/admins get `token: null`. `loopLog` (`loopany log`
  backend) is scoped to loops bound to that machine; cross-scope = flat 404.
- **Unified CLI dispatch `POST /api/machine/cli`** (`gateway/cli.ts`
  `CliGateway.cli(token, argv)`, over the injected core `MachineGateway`) is a
  ROUTER in front of the existing gateway logic, keying authority on CREDENTIAL TYPE
  first: a `dk_`-prefixed **device** token → owner verbs (`new`→createLoop,
  `loops`→listLoops, `edit`→editLoop, `log`→loopLog, `show`→describe, `home`→homeDevice —
  bare `loopany`'s content-first home, handled BEFORE the unknown-machine 401 guard so an
  unregistered machine renders a DEFINITIVE not-connected state, never a 401/empty;
  `report`/`finish` are run-only → 403); a **run** credential (an `rk_`-prefixed run lease,
  or a pre-Batch-6 bare UUID over a deploy) → the per-run `dispatch()` verbs PLUS a read
  branch (`log`/`show`/`home`→homeRun, the lease's OWN loop context) scoped to the lease's
  OWN loop (this closes the historical
  in-run `loopany log` 400 seam; batch 4 also wired a `log` case into `dispatch`
  itself, so run-credential `log` now works on BOTH the unified `/api/machine/cli`
  and the legacy `/agent-api/loop` transports — keeping the in-run help that
  advertises `log` truthful everywhere). Run-credential rules: owner-only verbs
  (`new`/`edit`/`loops`/`status`) → 403; a `--loop`/positional loop id that is not the
  lease's loop → **403, never a silent retarget**; a terminal-grace (reclaimed) lease →
  409 (same reclaim grace as `agentApi`). Floors/`allowControl`/`canFinish`/the shared
  content validators all flow through unchanged because the run path reuses `dispatch`.
  The router branches on the `dk_` device prefix vs a run-lease lookup, NOT on an `rk_`
  prefix — so a bare-UUID run token still routes to the run path (see the run-lease
  gotcha above for the wire format + back-compat). `loopLog`'s scoping body is factored
  into a private `renderLoopLog(machineId, loopId, limit)` shared by both the device
  `loopLog` (derives machineId from the token) and the run `log` branch (uses
  `lease.machineId`+`lease.loopId`), so the flat-404 existence-never-leaks rule cannot
  drift between them. The legacy `/agent-api/loop`, `/api/machine/loop`, and
  `/api/machine/log` routes stay as thin aliases onto the same gateway methods (no
  behavior change for existing daemons); `/machine/report` is untouched (daemon
  finalize, not a user verb). Same 2MB `readJsonBody` cap as every machine route.
  Every `/api/machine/cli` verb returns an axi-shaped TOON `text` field (plus an
  `exitCode`); the daemon is a pure text sink that prints `body.text`. Batch 1 shipped this
  as a **superset body** (TOON ALONGSIDE the structured JSON) so the 0.11 daemon could keep
  rendering structured server-first; **batch 7 retired that scaffolding** — `finalizeCli`
  (wraps `cli()`) now STRIPS the body to `{text, exitCode}` plus the retained data channels
  `{loops, runs}` (client-side loop resolution + the `log --json`/`--transcript` escape
  hatch), and the daemon dropped its structured-render fallback (a `text`-less server →
  `SERVER_TOO_OLD`). The LEGACY endpoints (`/api/machine/loop|log`, `/agent-api/loop`) call
  the gateway methods DIRECTLY, not through `finalizeCli`, so their full structured bodies
  are unchanged. The axi-conformance spine lives in `gateway/toon.ts`; details +
  batch-7 compat matrix in `packages/server/AGENTS.md`. The in-run callback prints
  `body.text`, so `renderLoopLog` carrying `text` is what makes in-run `loopany log` print
  (the F2 fix). `finalizeCli` fills `text` from any structured `{error}` and ensures
  `exitCode`; errors render as `error:`/`code:` TOON. Two behavior changes ride along:
  `report` and `finish` reject an invalid `--status` with a 400 `VALIDATION_ERROR` (F5) and
  a second `finish` pins `CONFLICT`. `describe()` (`show`) now emits the FULL editable envelope (batch 2):
  every `EDITABLE_LOOP_FIELDS` key keyed EXACTLY as `edit --json` accepts (`runAt` is
  the writable pinned override; the DB column stays `nextRunAt`) PLUS derived read-only
  aggregates (`nextFire`/`classification`/`runs`). `show --json` emits the envelope
  verbatim so dropping `id` roundtrips to a no-op `edit` patch (read/write identity,
  pinned by a roundtrip test); large `ui`/`workflow` show a `present, N bytes` hint
  unless `--full`. A run credential adds camelCase `selfSchedule`/`selfFinish` effective
  lines (these REPLACED the old kebab `self-schedule`/`self-finish` display keys). See
  `packages/server/AGENTS.md` for the durable notes.
- `auth.ts` THROWS at boot when the GitHub gate is on but `LOOPANY_AUTH_SECRET` is
  unset. Set the Fly secret before deploying with the gate on.
- Per-team connect-key: the claim carries the team (`rememberConnectKey` ->
  `connect_keys` table, keyed by the DERIVED machine id so the key itself is never
  stored; 24h TTL, durable across deploys). One row serves BOTH consumers: the
  self-register owner lookup (`getDeviceOwner`) and the createLoop team binding
  (`readClaimIntent`) - the old `deviceOwners`/`claimIntents` maps are gone. A
  cross-team create is fail-closed: claim minter must be the machine owner AND
  membership is re-validated at `createLoop` time. A machine's home team is always
  the owner's personal team; a loop's team comes from the validated claim.
- **Machine ENROLLMENT is gated** (`gateway/index.ts` `poll` is the ONLY
  self-register surface; every other machine route already 401s an unknown
  machine). `poll` validates the `dk_` token SHAPE (`isDeviceTokenShape`, a cheap
  malformed-input filter, NOT the auth boundary) then, on first contact: open mode
  (gate off) enrolls anonymously into `shared` as before; GATED mode
  (`loginGateEnabled()`, the live twin of auth.ts `authEnabled`) enrolls ONLY a
  token that resolves to a live connect key (`getDeviceOwner`) — an unknown/forged
  token is 401, never a `shared` machine (closes audit H-01/M2: unauthenticated
  machine/loop-row creation). An existing machine also re-checks the full
  `tokenHash` (id-collision guard). `lib/loginGate.ts` is the single source of the
  gate condition (leaf module, no betterAuth — keeps it off the poll hot path).
- **Machine routes are RATE LIMITED** (`gateway/rateLimit.ts`
  `machineRouteLimit`, applied at the top of every `/api/machine/*` + `/agent-api/loop`
  + `/machine/report` handler): in-process token buckets, per-IP (primary flood
  guard — forged-token floods share one IP bucket) + per-token (per-machine
  fairness), 429 when spent, bounded-memory LRU eviction. Env-tunable
  (`LOOPANY_RL_IP_BURST`/`_PER_SEC`, `LOOPANY_RL_TOKEN_*`); defaults (240 burst /
  8·s per IP) comfortably clear a connected daemon's 3s/20s poll.
  The byte-ingress routes — blob-PUT (`api.machine.blob.$hash`) and sync-POST
  (`api.machine.sync`) — are EXEMPT from rate limiting ENTIRELY (they never call
  `machineRouteLimit`): a large first sync bursts many concurrent blob PUTs on ONE
  device token, so either tier would only throttle legit uploads. Both already
  require a VALID registered device token (unknown ⇒ 401, not an unauthenticated
  surface) and are bounded by the sync hash-handshake (server only accepts hashes it
  asked THIS machine for) + per-loop 500MB / per-file 10MB / 32MB-body caps, so a
  limiter adds no real protection. Every OTHER machine route keeps BOTH tiers.
  OFF under vitest (`VITEST`/`NODE_ENV=test`) unless `LOOPANY_RATE_LIMIT=on`, so it
  never trips the suites; force either way with `LOOPANY_RATE_LIMIT`. `clientIp`
  trusts `Fly-Client-IP` → first `X-Forwarded-For` hop → `X-Real-IP` → one shared
  `unknown` bucket (fail-closed). NB: per-owner machine/loop QUOTAS are a noted
  follow-up, not yet implemented.
- Daemon jail: `LOOPANY_ROOTS` is an always-applied local jail (`roots.ts`) -
  server-sent roots can only NARROW it, paths are resolve-normalized before the
  prefix check. Child env is allowlisted everywhere (`spawn.ts`); the workflow
  subprocess gets extra keys only via `LOOPANY_WORKFLOW_ENV=KEY1,KEY2`. All daemon
  fetches go through `boundedFetch`; kills take the whole process group.
- Exec timeout is OPT-IN (`LOOPANY_EXEC_TIMEOUT_MS`; default unlimited). The guard
  against a vanished machine is the SERVER's inactivity-based sweep: poll writes a
  freshness stamp into run progress; a run is reclaimed only after `RUN_TIMEOUT_MS`
  of silence. A canceled run's late `report()`
  is ignored BEFORE any loop-level write (never advances cursor/taskFileContent).
- **The run credential is a RUN LEASE (`tokens.ts`, Batch 6)**, not a mint→revoke
  token: the per-run caps (`runId/loopId/machineId/role/allowControl/canSet*/canFinish`
  — the old `RunSlot` fields, now `RunLeaseCaps`) PLUS a tiny state machine `state:
  "active" | "terminal-grace"` + `expiresAt`. Wire token is `rk_<random>` (device
  stays `dk_`); the unified `cli` router branches on the `dk_` prefix, so a run token
  (rk_ OR a pre-Batch-6 bare UUID) falls through to the run path. The lease table is
  keyed by the FULL wire token, so `resolveLease` needs NO prefix parsing — a
  bare-UUID token minted before the deploy resolves identically (free back-compat; a
  daemon release is NOT required for this batch — the daemon forwards whatever token
  its env carries, opaque to shape). `resolveLease` lazily drops a lease past
  `expiresAt` (active leases carry `Infinity`, so a live run never times out here — the
  server's inactivity sweep is the vanished-machine guard). Leases are DURABLE
  (`run_leases` table, keyed by sha256(wire token) — hash only, a DB leak never
  hands out live credentials; `expiresAt` null encodes active/Infinity): a deploy
  is invisible to an in-flight run, and a long-sleep wake-report survives a
  restart inside its grace window. `store.deleteLoop` cascades the loop's leases
  (active ones have no expiry, so the prune alone would never collect them).
- **The old revoke/reclaim scatter collapses to ONE terminalize transition +
  retire + prune.** `registerRunLease` mints `active`. `terminalizeLease(runId)`
  flips `active` → `terminal-grace` with `expiresAt = now + TERMINAL_GRACE_MS` (24h,
  subsumes the former `RECLAIM_GRACE_MS`); it is called ONLY by `reclaimRun`
  (`gateway/index.ts`) when the sweep reclaims a stuck run as a false failure — so
  `terminal-grace` UNIQUELY marks a swept run (this is load-bearing: it lets the
  reconcile branch fire only for swept runs, never a normal failure report).
  `retireLease(token)` deletes the lease single-shot — called by every `report()`
  finalize consummation (normal final report, the enriching report after `finish`, the
  ONE reconciling wake-report, a canceled-run report). `pruneExpiredLeases(now)` in
  `sweep()` bounds memory. NB: `finish` deliberately does NOT terminalize — it leaves
  the lease ACTIVE for one enriching report, so the run may still `show` / a second
  `finish` → 400 (idempotency guard), and the enriching report retires it.
- **Sweep-reclaimed runs are NOT retired immediately** - the usual cause is a laptop
  that merely fell ASLEEP mid-run, and on wake the daemon delivers the real (often
  successful) result. `reclaimRun` TERMINALIZES the run's lease (grace) instead of
  retiring it, so `report()`'s `phase==="error" && lease.state==="terminal-grace"`
  branch honors exactly ONE late wake-report: a success flips the run back to `done`
  (clears the false error, records message/artifacts, retracts via the normal success
  push; the failure streak self-corrects since it's derived from persisted rows), a
  real failure replaces the generic reclaim reason (no second push). Single-shot
  (lease retired after). While terminal-grace, `agentApi`/`runCli` refuse mutations
  with 409 (only the final report reconciles). The daemon's `runner.ts` `report()`
  logs a clear line on a 401 (already retired) instead of silently dropping it.
- **A pending run on an unreachable machine is DEFERRED, never failed.** The
  pending row IS the durable inbox: the sweep holds it (no 60s "machine offline"
  reclaim anymore), the daemon's next poll claims it on reconnect (catch-up), and
  the NEXT cron fire supersedes a still-waiting one — the old slot retires as
  outcome `skipped` (phase `canceled`; neither success nor failure, excluded from
  the failure streak, quiet gray in the UI) via the phase-guarded
  `store.supersedePendingRun` (a run claimed in the same instant is left alone).
  Misfire grace = one cron period by construction, bounded by `DEFERRED_MAX_MS`
  (7d backstop → `skipped`). Alarm policy mirrors presence: asleep (<6h) is fully
  silent; a genuinely OFFLINE machine gets ONE calm `deferredMessage` per
  deferred exec run (dedup = the `DEFERRED_LABEL` progress stamp, which doubles
  as the UI "waiting" hint). Only a pending run an ONLINE machine never claims
  (>20min) still reclaims as an error ("run never claimed"). Supersede is
  exec→exec only: evolve/edit fires (or a pending evolve/edit) keep the old
  skip-this-tick behavior.
- **Boot misfire catch-up** (`scheduler.catchUpMissedFire`): croner only computes
  future fires, so a cron occurrence inside a deploy/restart window would vanish
  silently. `start()` reconstructs each enabled loop's most recent PAST occurrence
  (`previousRuns(1)`, loop tz); if it postdates both the loop's creation and its
  newest run, ONE compensating tick fires (coalesced by construction). Stands down
  when a past-due `nextRunAt` one-shot is present (armNextRunAt already catches
  those up). The machine-offline case needs nothing here - that fire DID tick and
  left a deferred pending run.
- **Machine presence is THREE-state** (`lib/machinePresence.ts`, shared by server
  `adapters.toJobDetail` + client `MachinesModal`): `online` (polled < 30s),
  `asleep` (seen < `MACHINE_ASLEEP_TTL_MS` = 6h — calm, "resumes automatically"),
  else `offline`. `JobDetail.machine` carries `{online, presence, lastSeen}`; `online`
  still gates run/evolve (a sleeping machine can't execute). The failure push copy
  (`notify.ts` `failureMessage`) is de-alarmed and names sleep as the likely cause,
  distinguishing an interrupted running run from a skipped scheduled one (no more
  "📵 appears offline"). Banner/string edits in `LoopDetailView`: entities in JS
  STRING literals are not decoded — write `&`, not `&amp;` (only JSX text decodes).
- **Circuit breaker**: `notifyRunFailure` auto-pauses a loop at
  `LOOPANY_FAILURE_AUTOPAUSE_STREAK` (default 10, 0=off) consecutive exec
  failures - `enabled=false` + unschedule + ONE autopause note that SUBSUMES the
  failure alert (silent under `notify:"never"`; a plain pause, re-enable resumes).
  `skipped` runs are transparent to the streak (it counts only phase `error`).
- Failure alerting: notifications fire on failure too (`report()` !ok + sweep
  reclaim). Anti-spam streak derives from persisted run rows (exact, deploy-safe):
  notify at streak 1, then every 5th; a success resets. Only exec failures notify;
  `notify:"never"` silences everything. The gateway takes an injectable notifier
  (like its injectable blobStore) so tests observe pushes without network.

## Server gotchas

- **One process owns the scheduler** (`ensureServer` globalThis guard). Never run
  the unified server AND `main.ts` against the same DB (double-fire).
- vite binds `127.0.0.1` (not IPv6 `localhost`) - see `vite.config.ts`.
- `src/routeTree.gen.ts` is generated + gitignored; `typecheck` runs `tsr generate`
  first. Run `routes:generate` standalone if you need the file otherwise.
- **Changed `db/schema.ts`? Migrate locally right away**: `db:generate` (diffs
  schema -> SQL, needs no DB) then `db:migrate`. `db:migrate` is the drizzle-kit CLI
  and needs `DIRECT_DATABASE_URL`/`DATABASE_URL` set - it errors on an empty URL and
  only targets a real Postgres (`drizzle.config.ts` routes it through `env.ts`
  `directDatabaseUrl()`, which THROWS when only a Supabase pooler `DATABASE_URL` is
  set with no `DIRECT_DATABASE_URL`, so DDL never runs over the `:6543` pooler);
  the embedded pglite tier has NO CLI migrate, it
  applies the generated migrations IN-PROCESS at boot. `boot.ts` `ensureServer` calls
  `runMigrations()` on every boot, so `pnpm dev` DOES auto-migrate the pglite tier in
  process (you still run `db:generate` to author the SQL); prod applies on `pnpm start`
  (`scripts/prestart.mjs`, postgres-js migrator over DIRECT for the hosted tier).
- Drizzle `text(col, { enum })` is TS-only (no DB CHECK) - enum value changes need
  no migration and cannot break rows.
- Server route files use `createFileRoute(path).server.handlers`; dynamic-import
  heavy/native deps INSIDE handlers to stay out of the client bundle.
- `editLoop` accepts the envelope fields plus content fields (workflow/ui/stateSchema)
  through the SAME `validate{Ui,Workflow,Schema}` helpers the run-token `set-*` path
  uses (two surfaces cannot drift; schema stays additive). Keys outside
  `EDITABLE_LOOP_FIELDS` are rejected with a 400 listing the allowed set. Both
  `loopany new` and `loopany edit` support `--dry-run` (server validate-only, zero
  persistence).
- **`createLoop` also accepts an optional `ui`** (gateway `createLoop`, same
  `validateUi` + `WIRE_TEXT_CAP` clip as `set-ui`/`editLoop`), so a template-driven
  loop ships a **day-one dashboard** instead of waiting for an evolve pass. The daemon
  `loopany new` spreads the whole `--json` config, so `ui` passes through with no
  whitelist change; `--dry-run` reports `ui` as a presence flag (like `workflow`), not
  the markup. `create.md`'s "Dashboard at create" step tells the agent to author the
  initial `ui` when the product shape is already known (cross-refs `evolve.md` §3).
  **A dropped dashboard is never silent**: the REAL create response echoes `ui`
  presence (and the CLI prints `dashboard ui: applied|not applied`), and when a
  provided `ui` validated to null the response carries a `warning` that the CLI shouts
  to stderr — create still succeeds, just without a dashboard.
- `describe()`/`validCadence` probe crons in the LOOP's timezone (fire times shift
  with it).

## Daemon gotchas

- **Routing lives in the pure `route.ts` `classify(argv, env)`** (batch 6, unit-tested
  without hanging a subprocess); `cli.ts` maps the returned `Route` to its lazily-imported
  handler. The in-run callback (`LOOPANY_RUN_TOKEN`+args) still wins FIRST; `-v`/`--version`
  (like `--help`/`-h`/`help`) is a light fast-path that prints just the version (`help.ts`
  `printVersion`, reusing `daemonVersion()`) and never launches a daemon (the usage screen
  also leads with that version). **`<verb> --help`/`-h` short-circuits to that verb's
  concise usage (`help.ts` `printVerbHelp`) BEFORE its handler runs** - parsed ahead of the
  `up`→daemon branch so `up --foreground --help` shows help, never the poll loop. This is
  the no-side-effect guarantee for foot-guns (`update` hands the daemon over immediately).
  Structural: a NEW verb inherits it by joining `route.ts` `COMMAND_VERBS` (add a matching
  `VERB_USAGE` entry; a missing one degrades to the full screen). **Bare `loopany` is now the content-first HOME**, not the
  foreground daemon: device out-of-run posts `home` on the device credential, in-run bare
  posts `home` on the run credential (fixes the old `argv.length > 0` guard). The
  foreground poll loop MOVED to `loopany up --foreground`; the `--server-url`/`--api-key`
  detached re-exec path is PRESERVED (still classifies as a `daemon` launch). An unknown
  leading verb still errors exit 2, never silently backgrounds a daemon.
  `report`/`finish`/`complete` typed OUT of a run are FORWARDED to the server so its
  crafted run-only 403 reaches the agent (F3); `loopany show` out-of-run (F1) resolves the
  loop client-side (like `log`, reusing `log.ts` `resolveLoopId`) then forwards.
- **`loopany setup hooks [--remove]`** (`setup.ts`): idempotent SessionStart hook install
  per `HOOK_TARGET_AGENTS` (a SUPERSET of `SKILL_TARGET_AGENTS` - grok gets a hook but is
  deliberately NOT a skill-install target, since it reads Claude's skills dir). Claude Code
  (`~/.claude/settings.json`), Codex (`~/.codex/hooks.json`), and Grok Build
  (`~/.grok/hooks/loopany.json`) all have concrete installers sharing ONE merge routine
  (`installJsonSessionStartHook` — all use the identical `{hooks:{SessionStart:[...]}}`
  JSON shape); each writes a SessionStart command hook running the durable ABSOLUTE
  `loopany` path (our shim or a PATH global), whose stdout lands as ambient context; an
  agent with no installer is reported `skipped`. **Codex discrepancy** (verified against
  codex-cli 0.143.0 + `/openai/codex` source): Codex additionally gates hooks behind
  `hooks = true` in `~/.codex/config.toml` AND a per-hook TRUST layer (`[hooks.state]`
  `trusted_hash = sha256:<canonical-TOML-of-normalized-identity>`, computed inside Codex).
  The installer deliberately writes ONLY the `hooks.json` entry (never synthesizes the
  version-sensitive hash, never mutates the TOML) and SURFACES the enable/trust step in the
  report. Grok Build's global hooks (one file per tool under `~/.grok/hooks/*.json`) are
  ALWAYS TRUSTED - no `hooks = true` config gate and no per-hook trust hash - so writing
  `loopany.json` makes the hook live immediately (no enable/trust note). Codex is fully
  executable (`codex exec` — see the `loops.agent` bullet). `up`/`update` call the
  best-effort `refreshHooks` (never blocks). The ambient hook installs ONLY with a
  DURABLE on-PATH `loopany` (`resolveDurableCommand`: our shim OR a NON-ephemeral PATH
  global, returned as an absolute path - the transient `npx`/`_npx` PATH entry is
  filtered out, so it gates exactly like the bin shim, F6) — the automatic path SKIPS
  it with `npm i -g` guidance when only a bare, non-PATH (or ephemeral npx) `loopany`
  would result; the explicit verb still installs but warns.
- **PATH shim** (`bin-shim.ts`): `up`/`update` write a version-consistent `loopany`
  re-exec wrapper (same launcher-replay as `callback-bin.ts`) to the npm global bin
  (`npm_config_prefix`) else `~/.local/bin`, with one-line PATH guidance. It lands ONLY
  from a durable install (`isEphemeralEntry` skips an npx/npm-cache re-exec) and NEVER
  clobbers a foreign `loopany` (refreshes only our own shim, detected by `SHIM_MARKER`).
  `ensureBinShim` returns `{path,onPath,written}` so callers/tests assert skipped-vs-written.
  **TEST HAZARD**: `ensureBinShim`/`refreshHooks` write the REAL `~/.claude/settings.json`
  + `~/.local/bin` unless injected — `ensure.test.ts`'s `seams()` no-ops both, and every
  setup/bin-shim test injects fs/env seams. See `packages/server/AGENTS.md` for the server
  `home` verb + full text-sink notes.
- Pidfile `~/.loopany/daemon.pid` records `<pid>:<startTime>` so a pid reused after
  an unclean crash is never mistaken for the daemon (or SIGTERMed by `down`).
  `loopany up` consults the pidfile first (never spawns a second daemon); the device
  token passes to the child via ENV, never argv (`ps`-visible).
- `loopany new` takes `--json '<inline>'` (or `--json -` for stdin); `loopany edit`
  is JSON-only (`--json '<obj>'`) plus the content-file trio (`--workflow-file`,
  `--ui-file`, `--schema-file`). Unknown flags reject loudly. The server is the sole
  validator.
- `loopany log [<loop>]` - concise run survey (session ids + metrics; `--transcript`/
  `--full` for full text; `--json` structured). Backed by `GET /api/machine/log` (device
  token). `--json`/`--transcript` keep the structured render (the text-sink server survey
  is concise, no `--full` inline yet).
- `loopany update` hands the running daemon over to the invoking (new) CLI version:
  `down` then `runEnsure({force:true})` - force skips the still-reported-online
  short-circuit (server `ONLINE_TTL` 30s outlives the local pidfile clear).
- `loops.agent` (`CodingAgent` enum: `claude-code|codex|grok`) records the loop's host
  coding agent AND selects the executor (at create: measured env fingerprint >
  `--agent` > server default; detection markers in `create.ts detectAgentFromEnv`).
  Editable afterward on the edit path - in `EDITABLE_LOOP_FIELDS`, `loopany edit
  --json`/`show` roundtrip, and the web `LoopForm` agent select (the next run picks
  up a changed agent). `runner.ts buildAgentSpawn` branches on `d.loop.agent`
  (delivered by server `gateway/delivery.ts`):
  - `claude-code` → `claude` (`LOOPANY_CLAUDE_BIN`) with stream-json + bypassPermissions
  - `grok` → `grok` (`LOOPANY_GROK_BIN`): drops `--verbose` (exit-2 rejects it) + the
    sys-prompt-file flag; uses `--output-format streaming-json` (not `stream-json`);
    `execEnv("grok")` forwards `XAI_API_KEY`/`GROK_HOME`/`XAI_API_BASE_URL` (OAuth via
    `~/.grok` is free through `HOME`)
  - `codex` → `codex exec` (`LOOPANY_CODEX_BIN`): `--json`,
    `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox`, `--skip-git-repo-check`, optional
    `-m`; resume is `codex exec resume <sessionId> …`; `execEnv("codex")` forwards
    `OPENAI_API_KEY`/`CODEX_API_KEY`/`CODEX_HOME` (session/config under `~/.codex`
    free via `HOME`)
  **Non-Claude telemetry is DEGRADED**: grok's headless stream is grok-native
  (`thought`/`text`/`end`, no cost/usage) and codex `--json` is not Claude
  stream-json, so the Claude-shaped `makeStreamConsumer` parses nothing — a run
  still marks ok on exit 0 and the agent's own `loopany report` persists the
  result; daemon-side live-progress/cost/transcript await per-agent stream adapters.
  Grok's SessionStart hook (`setup.ts`, `~/.grok/hooks/loopany.json`, always-trusted)
  rides `HOOK_TARGET_AGENTS` (a superset of `SKILL_TARGET_AGENTS` — grok reads
  Claude's skills dir so it is NOT a skill-install target). The enum's single source
  is `CODING_AGENTS` in `packages/server/src/types.ts`
  (the schema type/column enum + the `coerceCodingAgent` validator + the web select all
  derive from it; widening the set is a one-line edit there).
- External touches (process/network/fs) are injectable seams throughout; tests never
  need a real process or network.
- **Unified CLI transport `cli-client.ts` `postCli(argv, legacy, deps)`** (batch 5):
  the ONE client behind BOTH CLI worlds. It selects the credential by env (run token
  from `LOOPANY_RUN_TOKEN` wins, else the persisted device token), inlines the file
  flags (`--message-file`→`--message`, `--state-file`→`--state-content`, `--file`→
  `--file-content` — moved out of `callback.ts` so both credentials get it), and POSTs
  `{argv}` to the unified `/api/machine/cli` (server batch 4). On a **404** (old server)
  it invokes the per-credential `legacy` fallback — `legacyRun` → `/agent-api/loop` for
  a run token; the caller-supplied device fallback (`/api/machine/loop` GET/POST/PATCH,
  `/api/machine/log`) for owner verbs — one release of back-compat. `callback.ts` /
  `interactive.ts` / `log.ts` / `create.ts` all converge onto it (batch 6 adds
  `show`/`home` to the convergence, and every server-verb path now PRINTS the server's
  `body.text`+`exitCode` via `cli-client.ts` `printTextOrTooOld` — batch 7 retired the
  one-release structured-render fallback, so a `text`-less pre-0.12 server surfaces a
  definitive `SERVER_TOO_OLD` error, `home` a `tooOldHome`); the LOCAL verbs
  (up/down/update/skill/status/setup/help/version + the `--foreground`/detached daemon
  launch) keep their own fast-paths and never touch the server. `log`'s cwd→loop resolution stays CLIENT-side (lists loops,
  then posts `log <id>`) because the server's `log` dispatch needs an explicit id.
  This ships in the npm daemon package, so it needs a coordinated `@crewlet/loopany`
  release. (The daemon still forwards whatever token its env carries — the `rk_` run
  lease is batch 6, not here.)
- **Transient-failure resume (`runner.ts`)**: a claude crash is CLASSIFIED
  (`classifyFailure`, precedence auth/quota > poisoned > transient > task) and only
  `transient` (API error / connection closed / ECONNRESET / stream closed /
  overloaded / rate limit / 5xx) retries - `claude --resume <sessionId>` with a
  short continuation prompt (`buildResumeTask`: trust prior progress, end with
  exactly ONE report/finish), up to `LOOPANY_TRANSIENT_RETRIES` (default 2) with
  `LOOPANY_TRANSIENT_RETRY_BASE_MS` backoff (15s, x4, jitter; consts read at
  module load - tests re-import). `--resume` FORKS the session id: track the
  latest for the next resume + transcript recovery. Timeouts never retry (our
  wall-clock guard, not a provider blip); no captured session = nothing to
  resume; abort stops immediately. Spend is SUMMED across attempts (`addCost`);
  the report carries `attempts` only when > 1, and the server folds it into
  `runs.usage.attempts` (TS-only jsonb field, no migration). A progress label
  keeps the sweep fed during the backoff window.
- **`runner.ts` skips the sys file + `--append-system-prompt-file` when the delivery's
  `systemPrompt` is empty** (batches 1-2 make it empty; an OLD server that still
  populates it keeps working — the flag path is preserved when the string is non-empty).

## Web UI gotchas

- **The dashboard's team lives in the URL** (`/t/$teamId`, `routes/t.$teamId.tsx`;
  Phase 2 of the team-URL design). The shared `DashboardView` renders it AND bare `/`
  (open mode); the list server fns (`listJobs`/`listMachines`/`listMyTeams`) + `mintClaim`
  take an EXPLICIT `teamId`, membership-validated via `requestScope(explicitTeam?)` (route
  param wins over the `loopany.team` cookie), so tabs on `/t/A` and `/t/B` show different
  teams at once. The cookie is now ONLY the bare-`/` redirect's last-used hint, never an
  auth key. Gated `/` redirects to `/t/<last-used|personal>` (`getDefaultTeam`); the
  signed-out CTA + open mode render at `/`. Non-member `/t/<x>` throws the same generic
  not-found as a missing loop (`canViewTeam`, enumeration-safe). A team id rides the URL
  verbatim (`params.teamId`). The `/t/$teamId` route mounts `DashboardView` with
  `key={teamId}` so a switcher `/t/A`→`/t/B` navigation re-seeds its fetch-then-set poll
  state (same route, new param ⇒ no natural remount). Guards:
  `-index.regression.test.ts`, `auth.test.ts` (requestScope precedence).
- **The cross-loop timeline** (`components/LoopTimeline.tsx`, routes
  `t.$teamId_.timeline.tsx` + open-mode `timeline.tsx`) is ONE form at every zoom:
  **row = loop, x = time**, zoom (day default / week / month) changes only the
  window. Deliberately NOT a merged calendar - a run is a POINT event, so a Gantt
  bar has no length and a shared day-cell becomes overlapping chips; lanes on a
  shared axis give the same machine-contention read as a calendar (simultaneous
  fires line up VERTICALLY) and scale to any loop count. **Hue stays on STATUS**
  (`dotColor`, shared with the loop card's strip); loop identity is the row label,
  because hue is bounded (~5-8 slots, and every Rubik hue is already a status
  colour) while loops are not. Marks carry no text - detail is a cursor tooltip -
  so lanes stay dense. Backed by `listTimeline` (`server/loopApi.ts`) over
  `store.listTeamRunsInRange` (runs ⋈ loops on `team_id`; `runs` has no teamId) plus
  `server/timeline.ts` `projectFires` - a croner projection of FUTURE fires
  (dashed ghosts past the now-line), which is what makes the view answer "what
  runs every day and at what time"; a history-only timeline cannot. Projection is
  capped per loop (`MAX_PROJECTED_PER_LOOP`) and the run query at
  `TIMELINE_RUN_CAP` (over ⇒ `truncated`, surfaced, never silently clipped).
  Gotchas: the now-line is drawn INSIDE each track (an overlay across the grid has
  to re-derive the label column width in a `calc()`, which drifts at the mobile
  breakpoint); axis edge ticks ANCHOR instead of centring (day zoom always has a
  tick at exactly 100%); mark width is true duration floored in px and clamped to
  `100 - left`. `cronText` (`lib/format.ts`) is the ONE cron humaniser - the lane
  label, loop card and form all read it, so a change shows in three places.
- Loop detail and run detail are PAGES, not modals: `/loops/$loopId` and
  `/loops/$loopId/runs/$runId` (route file `loops.$loopId_.runs.$runId.tsx` - the
  trailing `_` un-nests it). Never render Base UI `Dialog.*` parts (e.g. `ModalHead`)
  without a `Dialog.Root` ancestor - it throws at runtime; bare-page edit modes use
  `EditHead`.
- **Run detail live Activity card** (`RunView.tsx` `LiveActivity`): rendered ONLY when
  `run.running`, it mirrors the loop page's Runs-list live line (pulsing dot via the
  shared `runPulseStyle` + `step N` + `run.progress.label`) plus a ticking elapsed
  clock (a local 1s timer, since `durationMs` is null mid-flight). It refreshes off the
  page's existing 3s self-poll (`getJobDetail`, no new realtime mechanism); missing
  `run.progress` falls back to a "waiting for the first heartbeat" line. Gated on
  `run.running` so terminal runs (ok/failed/skipped) never mount it and their pages stay
  byte-identical. Guarded by `runDetailLiveActivity.test.ts`.
- **Loop-detail Edit composer (`editVia`)** offers TWO paths: (1) **Dispatch** -
  `requestEdit({id, instruction})` runs ONE agent pass on the owner's machine
  (spends credits, no conversation); (2) **Copy prompt** - `copyEditPrompt` copies a
  self-contained prompt (`lib/editPrompt.ts` `buildEditPrompt`, a PURE + unit-tested
  helper) for the owner to paste into their OWN local coding-agent session and adjust
  the loop conversationally (no dispatch, no credits). The hint names WHERE to run it,
  deriving the loop's on-disk dir from `job.taskFile` via `loopDir` (degrades to a
  generic instruction, never a fabricated path). Generic operation copy is
  **agent-neutral** ("your coding agent"), NOT "Claude Code" - Loopany runs more than
  one agent (claude-code, codex, grok, more later); the only "Claude Code"/"Codex" survivors
  are the `AGENT_LABEL` chip (the loop's ACTUAL recorded agent, a factual label).
  Guarded by `loopDetailEdit.regression.test.ts`.
- **Hard rule: no page-level horizontal scroll.** `min-w-0` on every grid/flex child;
  wide content scrolls inside its own pane (dashboard `overflow-x-auto`, `.taskmd
  table` as a scrolling block, `Timeline` row `min-w-0 overflow-x-auto`). Guarded by
  the `*.regression.test.ts` files - keep them green. NB the dashboard HEADER still
  overflows below ~690px (its shrink-0 button row); pre-existing, not the content grid.
- **Source-reading test guards must keep the path in a VARIABLE**:
  `readFileSync(fileURLToPath(new URL(rel, import.meta.url)))`. Vite statically rewrites
  the LITERAL `new URL('./x.tsx', import.meta.url)` form into an asset URL
  (`http://localhost:3000/...`), which `fileURLToPath` then rejects with "The URL must be
  of scheme file". Every guard in the repo uses the variable form - copy it, don't inline.
- Dashboard generative-UI primitives are `loop-embed`/`loop-calendar`/`loop-kanban`
  (registry in `LoopView.tsx`; `loop-kanban` in `components/LoopKanban.tsx` is a
  collection view grouping front-matter-`type`d markdown artifacts into columns -
  `columns` REQUIRED + comma-separated, unmatched types collect in a trailing
  "Other" column, task file always excluded). Registering one means moving THREE
  things together: (1) `LOOP_TAGS`/`LOOP_ATTRS` + the DOMPurify `uponSanitizeAttribute`
  force-keep hook (data-bearing attrs like `columns`/`match` are otherwise stripped,
  silently blanking the element); (2) the html-react-parser `replace` swap; (3) the
  skill authoring docs (`evolve.md` §3 + `skill/run/edit.md`, plus `create.md` §2
  for the `type` vocabulary). Board row is the ONLY horizontal-scroll container
  (`min-w-0 overflow-x-auto`, columns `shrink-0` fixed-width) - a wide board scrolls
  inside its pane, never widening the page. Skill markdown + UI copy is ENGLISH ONLY.
- Recharts stays OUT of the base client bundle (`LoopDetailView` lazy-loads the
  `LoopView` chunk). All animation is off, INCLUDING `<Tooltip
  isAnimationActive={false}>` (the position tween causes a transient page scrollbar
  flash). Testing: Recharts v3 mounts via effects - use a client render under `act`
  plus a jsdom ResizeObserver stub that fires a real contentRect on `observe`.
- Files panel: the task file IS the loop folder's README and appears EXACTLY ONCE
  (`lib/fileEntries.ts` dedup on normalized paths); the task row renders
  `taskFileContent` from the loop record, not the blob fetch.
- Dashboard refresh is fetch-then-set, never `router.invalidate` (its loader re-run
  throws on a transient blip; keep stale data instead).
- **Artifact viewer** (`components/artifactView.tsx` `ArtifactBody`, one source for
  the Files panel + every dashboard primitive's detail): dispatch by
  `lib/artifactKind.ts` (extension only). HTML renders in a STRICT sandboxed iframe
  (`srcDoc` + `sandbox="allow-scripts"`, NEVER `allow-same-origin` → opaque origin;
  scripts run but can't read the app's cookies/session or reach `parent` - this is
  the stored-XSS containment, load-bearing; a Preview/Source toggle exposes raw
  markup). Images (incl. SVG - scriptable, so NEVER inlined into the app DOM) render
  via `<img src=inlineHref>` off the hardened `?view=inline` route. Markdown → the
  shared pipeline; oversize → a metadata-only note (no synced bytes). `LoopEmbed`
  disables the pixel-collapse for html/image (they self-bound + scroll internally).
- **The dashboard is a DEFAULT responsive grid CAPPED AT TWO COLUMNS** (`.loopview` in
  `styles/app.css`, `auto-fit minmax(min(100%, max(28rem, (100% - gap) / 2)), 1fr)`):
  independent top-level panels tile side by side on desktop (calendar left, document
  right) and stack when narrow; headings/prose/`hr`/`section` AND content blocks
  (`ul`/`ol`/`table`/`pre`/`blockquote`/`figure`/`img`) all span full width, so ONLY
  the custom `loop-*` panels + their explicit `div` wrappers tile. The `(100% - gap) / 2`
  per-track min is never smaller than half the row, so a third track can never fit (a
  hard two-column cap at any width - an uncapped `auto-fit` used to spill a wide ~1180px
  area into 3+ narrow columns, squeezing a kanban's own columns and card titles);
  `auto-fit` still collapses to ONE full-width column for a lone panel (no regression for
  chart-only / single-embed dashboards) and for a container too narrow (~below 916px,
  where the 28rem floor wins). The gap is a shared `--loopview-gap` custom property used
  in BOTH the track formula and the `gap` declaration so the cap math can never drift from
  the actual gap. `LoopView` dropped `space-y-*` so the grid gap owns spacing.

- **First-run onboarding** (`routes/onboarding.tsx` → `components/OnboardingWizard.tsx`)
  is its OWN route, NOT a homepage overlay - deliberately, so it never restructures the
  dashboard. The homepage's only footprint is `components/OnboardingEntry.tsx` (one line +
  import in `DashboardView`): it auto-starts the wizard ONCE for a fully empty workspace
  (no loops AND no machines, `markOnboardingDismissed` set BEFORE the redirect so Back
  can't re-trigger) and otherwise shows a quiet re-entry banner while the user has no
  loops. Both entry paths carry the DASHBOARD's team as `?team=<id>`; the route prefers it
  over the cookie-backed `getDefaultTeam()` (validated with the same `canViewTeam` gate as
  `/t/$teamId`, so a URL team is never trusted) - otherwise a bookmarked `/t/<B>` would
  mint the machine + claim into whatever team the last-used cookie points at. The wizard
  MIRRORS how a loop is really born and advances ONLY on DETECTED
  reality: the machine step reuses `createMachine`/`machineStatus` (Continue gated on
  `.online`), the create step reuses `mintClaim`/`claimStatus` + the Housekeeper template
  `description` (auto-advances on `.done`) - never a claimed Next. Step + minted tokens
  persist per team via `lib/onboardingState.ts` (pure, unit-tested) so a mid-flow reload
  resumes. The "Meet Housekeeper" step embeds `HousekeeperCinematic` - a spring-physics
  FOUR-act storyboard (in-house CSS/SVG/JS, NO framer-motion): (1) odometer clock rolling
  to 07:00 (the loop's REAL `0 7 * * *` cadence - act 1, the sr-only label, the still, and
  act 4's "Every morning · 07:00" must all name the same time), (2) a stylized NON-GitHub PR mock (staggered deletion-line sweep, −102 odometer,
  a "Merged" STAMP), (3) a DAY-BY-DAY compounding montage - Day 1→30 counter + a per-day
  grid filling one cell/day + the score STEPPING 30→80 (arc nudges then holds each day) with
  a landing pop + ring/spark flourish, (4) a cadence beat ("Every morning · 07:00", rests).
  Driven by ONE `elapsed`-ms clock advanced by a frame `setInterval` that runs only while
  playing AND unfinished (the ticker's guard reads a `finished` BOOLEAN, not `elapsed`, so
  it stops once the story rests without re-creating the interval every frame) - so every
  beat is a pure function of `elapsed` and hover PAUSES the whole thing
  (`onMouseEnter/Leave` → `paused`; React synthesizes those from delegated mouseover/mouseout,
  so tests dispatch THOSE, not raw enter/leave). Springs are CSS back-out cubic-beziers
  (`--hk-spring` in app.css, `hk-*` keyframes); using `elapsed` (not `Date.now`/rAF) keeps
  vitest fake timers driving it. Acts crossfade+transform for choreographed handoff; RESTS on
  the last act with Replay; `prefers-reduced-motion` (JS `matchMedia`) renders a separate
  4-frame static-stills path. Decorative only - never gates Continue. `data-act`
  (0/1/2/3 or "stills") + `data-testid=hk-score`/`hk-day` are the test hooks.
- **Live creation checklist** (round 4, emit path reworked in round 8): the Create step
  shows agent-reported milestones lighting up instead of a bare "Waiting…". Fixed enum
  `lib/creationSteps.ts` (`CREATION_STEPS` + `deriveStepStates`, tolerant of skipped/
  repeated/out-of-order/absent/junk - keys off the highest reported index). The agent
  reports each milestone to `POST /api/claim/progress` (`routes/api.claim.progress.ts`),
  enum-only + `dk_`-shaped claim + body cap + IP flood guard IN THAT ORDER (the per-IP
  `machineRouteLimit(request)` runs BEFORE the capped `readJsonBody`, so a limited or
  oversized request never costs a body read; the per-claim bucket can only key off a
  parsed claim, so it rides `machineCredentialLimit` - the token tier alone, keeping the
  IP bucket spent exactly once per request), stored in a bounded/TTL'd
  in-memory map keyed by the claim token (`tokens.ts` `recordClaimProgress`/
  `readClaimProgress`, enum re-validated at storage). **The checklist + its polling are
  ONE shared surface** (`components/CreationChecklist.tsx`: `CreationChecklist` +
  `useCreationProgress(token, active)`), used by BOTH the onboarding wizard's Create step
  AND the dashboard's regular New-Loop `ComposeModal` "Waiting for your coding agent…"
  state (round 9) — so the two can't drift (same pattern as the shared `ChannelAddForm`).
  **Emit path (round 8): the
  loop-creation SKILL, not the pasted prompt.** `references/create.md` tells the agent to
  run `loopany progress <step> --connect-key <key>` per milestone (best-effort); the daemon
  subcommand (`progress-cli.ts` → `runProgress`, route `progress`) POSTs the same contract,
  resolving the claim from the snippet's connect-key and the server-URL ambiently from
  `~/.loopany` (never throws / always exit 0). The pasted snippet is lean again (bootstrap
  + config + template intent — NO curl/endpoint text). The wizard polls `claimProgress`
  alongside `claimStatus` (the latter stays AUTHORITATIVE - the checklist NEVER gates).
  Elapsed-aware reassurance after 25s quiet. Dev-sim still POSTs the endpoint directly.
- **Post-creation `live` step** (rounds 5+6): after the loop is created the wizard does NOT
  end — a single `live` step folds the celebration, the first-run wait, and notification
  binding. (1) **First run**: `createLoop` already fires an immediate `scheduler.runNow`, so
  the wizard polls `firstRunStatus(loopId)` (pure branch table `lib/firstRun.ts`
  `firstRunStateFrom`: done→payoff, error→`failed` (same hand-off, honest non-success
  copy — never "First run complete" on a failed run), running→live,
  pending+offline/canceled→honest `scheduled` handoff — never a spinner-trap) and on a
  finished run (`firstRunFinished`) shows a big CTA into the Loop page (`onSeeResult` →
  `/loops/$loopId/runs/$runId`) — the payoff. `scheduled` is NOT terminal on the first
  read: the poll settles into the queued handoff only after `SCHEDULED_SETTLE_POLLS`
  consecutive scheduled reads, so the transient pending+offline window between
  `createLoop`'s run-now and the daemon's claim can't strand the user. Zero code-exec: it
  only READS run rows, never triggers a run. (2) **Notify binding** fills the wait, reusing the
  ONE shared `components/ChannelAddForm.tsx` (extracted from `NotificationsModal`, so the two
  binding surfaces can't drift; channels are slack/telegram/feishu via `createChannel` +
  live `testChannel` ping). Fully optional (dashboard/see-result always available). Persisted
  `loopId` + the `live` step make it resumable; dev-sim adds `simulateFirstRun` (seeds a
  finished run + report so the Loop page shows content) and `simulateNotifyBind` (a demo
  channel + test-ok).
- **DEV-ONLY onboarding sim** lets the flow be clicked locally without a second machine.
  ONE gate, `lib/onboardingSim.ts` `onboardingSimEnabled()` = NOT a production build AND
  `LOOPANY_ONBOARDING_SIM` truthy; `getConfig` echoes it so the wizard's "Simulate …"
  buttons only render when it's on, and `server/onboardingSim.ts` (`simulateMachineConnect`
  / `simulateLoopCreated`) refuse when it's off - so a prod build can reach neither the
  affordance nor the effect. The sim writes the SAME store rows a real daemon would
  (`updateMachine` online / `gateway.createLoop` with the claim), so the detection paths
  the wizard polls stay 100% real. Local demo: `LOOPANY_ONBOARDING_SIM=1 LOOPANY_DATA_DIR=<fresh>
  LOOPANY_DB=pglite pnpm dev`.
- **Shared-Chrome contention in browser verify**: other lanes drive the same Chrome, so a
  bare `chrome-devtools-axi` tab gets navigated out from under you mid-flow. Set
  `CHROME_DEVTOOLS_AXI_SESSION=<lane>` to get a fully isolated browser instance for the run.

## CI/CD (`.github/workflows/`)

- `deploy.yml`: push to `main` -> `flyctl deploy --remote-only` (Fly app
  `loopany-testing`). Migrations apply on container boot (forward-only). Both deploy
  workflows bake `--build-arg GIT_SHA`/`BUILT_AT` into the image; `/api/health` returns
  `{ok, sha, builtAt}` (baked ENV, `"unknown"` in local dev) and a post-deploy smoke
  step asserts the served `sha` == the pushed `github.sha`.
- `deploy-prod.yml`: **auto-promotes after a GREEN staging deploy** -> `loopany-prod` /
  loopany.ai, `--ha=false` single machine (single-scheduler invariant). It triggers on
  `workflow_run` of "Deploy (Fly)" and the job `if:` gates on
  `conclusion == 'success'`, so prod is NEVER deployed straight off a raw push to main or
  a `v*` tag - only after loopany-testing serves the commit. `workflow_dispatch` stays for
  out-of-band promotes/retries, and the `production` GitHub Environment can add required
  reviewers on top. Builds `DEPLOY_SHA` = the triggering run's `head_sha` (a `workflow_run`
  event's `github.sha` is default-branch HEAD, which can drift past the staged commit;
  manual dispatch falls back to `github.sha`). A preflight step fails loud if
  `FLY_API_TOKEN_PROD` is empty. Migrations are forward-only, so an image rollback does
  NOT roll back schema; check the `machines.daemon_version` fleet before removing legacy
  endpoints.
- `publish-daemon.yml`: tag `v*` -> `npm publish` of the daemon ONLY, via **npm OIDC
  trusted publishing** - no `NPM_TOKEN`, and `setup-node` deliberately omits
  `registry-url` (setting it writes a dummy-token `.npmrc` that breaks OIDC; that was
  a real publish failure). Needs npm >= 11.5 (installed in-workflow). The tag must
  match `packages/daemon/package.json` version. pnpm version comes solely from the
  root `packageManager` field (do not also pass `version:` to `pnpm/action-setup`).
  The repo is PUBLIC, so OIDC publishing emits a sigstore provenance statement -
  `packages/daemon/package.json` MUST carry a `repository` object whose `url`
  resolves to this source repo (`git+https://github.com/superdesigndev/loopany-platform.git`,
  `directory: packages/daemon`) or npm rejects the publish with a 422 (an empty/
  absent `repository.url` fails provenance validation). Do not strip that field.

## Maintaining this file

Keep this file for knowledge useful to almost every future agent session in this project.
Do not repeat what the codebase already shows; point to the authoritative file or command instead.
Prefer rewriting or pruning existing entries over appending new ones.
When updating this file, preserve this bar for all agents and keep entries concise.
