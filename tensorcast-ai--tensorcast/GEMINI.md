## Project Overview

TensorCast is a high-performance distributed artifact storage and loading system. It uses a distributed master-worker architecture; see Architecture Overview below for details.

## Artifact-First Architecture Principle (Required)

TensorCast should keep artifact as the primary system abstraction for durable
identity, data movement, discovery, routing, and lifecycle. When a new workflow
needs a capability that looks adjacent to loading, serving, publication, or
sharing, first ask how the artifact model should express it and extend that
model deeply.

Avoid introducing parallel concepts, side channels, or feature-specific source
authorities when the capability can be represented as stronger artifact
metadata, artifact lifecycle, artifact publication, or artifact replica
semantics. Add a new concept only when the artifact model is clearly
insufficient, and document why extending artifact would be the wrong abstraction.

## Command Execution

- You must use `pytest tests/python/xxxx` to run python tests
- You must use `bazel test //core/component:xxx_test` to run cxx tests
- These policies keep virtualenv isolation consistent; violating them can break the build and introduce environment skew.

## Python SDK Daemon Startup (Quick Map)

- Store API calls (e.g., `tc.from_disk`) go through `tensorcast.api.store.runtime.get_context()`; if no runtime exists it tries `startup.init(mode="connect")` and falls back to `startup.init(mode="create")`.
- `startup.init(mode="connect")` resolves the daemon address from an explicit parameter or the current local session (`runtime.status()` / service manager); it errors if no session is found or the daemon is unreachable.
- `startup.init(mode="create")` launches a local daemon via `runtime.start(...)` using a daemon config path selected in order: explicit `daemon_config_path` → `$TENSORCAST_DAEMON_CONFIG` → `examples/config/store_daemon_config.yaml` (repo or packaged wheel).
- If the chosen config enables HA or disk operations, the daemon must have `daemon_id` set (for Global Store registration) and `server.storage_path` set (for disk materialization). Missing values cause startup to exit early with clear errors.
- **Hard rule (required)**: Python SDK code MUST NOT connect to Global Store directly (no direct gRPC channel/stub, no Global Store endpoint usage). SDK key-mapping, artifact metadata, and control-path operations MUST go through the Store Daemon APIs only.

### Local GS/Daemon Startup (Blocking, Repro Baseline)

Use the following startup order for local debugging/repro:

```bash
# Terminal 1: start Global Store (blocking)
source .venv/bin/activate
tensorcast-cli global start --blocking

# Terminal 2: start Store Daemon (blocking), connect to local GS
source .venv/bin/activate
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/data/cuda/compat tensorcast-cli daemon start --blocking \
  --global-store-mode connect \
  --global-store-address 127.0.0.1:50051
```

Optional cleanup commands:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
tensorcast-cli daemon stop
tensorcast-cli global stop
```

### Multi-host Daemon Orchestration (Required)

For cross-host tests (including WeightPublisher and fanout benchmarks), use the
following daemon orchestration rules:

- Assign a unique local daemon listen/connect port per node (or per role process)
  and keep it stable for the whole case. Do not reuse a single default port
  across all roles.
- Manage daemon lifecycle explicitly in the runner:
  - Pre-clean stale daemon sessions/processes before starting a case.
  - Start daemon with an explicit session id and verify ready status before
    launching role workloads.
  - Stop the same explicit session during teardown (including failure paths).
- Run Global Store on the local control host by default for cross-host cases.
  Do not colocate GS with role workers unless the case explicitly requires it.
  This avoids worker-scoped daemon lifecycle cleanup from stopping GS.
- Do not rely on implicit SDK auto-create startup in multi-host tests; role
  scripts should connect to a known local daemon endpoint.
- Keep SDK connectivity local-only on each node: app processes connect to their
  own node-local daemon address, never directly to a remote daemon or GS.

### Core Components
- **C++ Core** (`/core/`): Store Engine, Checkpoint, and Communicator. The Store Engine uses a UnifiedMemoryAuthority (UMA) single-ledger memory model, replica lifecycle helpers, loaders (disk and P2P), and CUDA IPC export for clients.
- **Store Daemon (C++)** (`/daemon`): Thin gRPC service over `StoreEngine` that manages sessions, PID refs, and transport locks. Binary target `//daemon:tensorcast_daemon` (also shipped with the Python wheel).
- **Global Store (Python)** (`/tensorcast/global_store`): Central metadata and coordination service backed by DuckDB; exposes gRPC APIs and Prometheus metrics.
- **Protocol Buffers** (`/proto/`): gRPC surfaces for daemon and control plane.
- **User Process Worker**: Client process consuming artifacts via `tensorcast` APIs (e.g., `tensorcast.get()`), mapping CUDA IPC handles for zero‑copy GPU access.

### Build Systems
- **Primary**: Bazel (Bzlmod) for C++ Core and Daemon
- **Secondary**: setuptools + `uv` for Python packaging/clients
- **Dependencies**: LibTorch 2.6/2.7, CUDA 12.4+, gRPC, Protocol Buffers

## Documentation Structure and Project Hierarchy

This repository’s documentation has been organized so that each module owns a focused `README.md`, with cross-cutting guides under `docs/`. Use the map below to navigate, and when you update any module, also update its corresponding documentation.
Note: When writing documentation, you may use Mermaid diagrams to illustrate flows, state machines, hierarchies, and architecture where appropriate.

### Doc sync rule (required for agents)

- Update module docs **only when** a change affects external behavior, configuration, or user/operator workflow.
- Skip doc updates for internal-only refactors, guardrails, or error-path tweaks that do not change the public contract.
- If you modify Protocol Buffers, also regenerate code as described in this file under “Protocol Buffer Code Generation”.
- Keep links consistent across docs/architecture, docs/internals, and module sub-docs.
- In PRs, include doc updates in the same change set so readers can rely on documentation being current.

- When authoring any design or plan document, follow the repository’s documentation system specification in ./docs/designs/0001-docs-system-design.md for required structure, metadata/frontmatter, and cross-linking. Use the templates defined there and maintain the 1:1 design↔plan linkage.
- `docs/designs/` and `docs/plans/` filenames begin with a zero-padded sequence number: `0001-<slug>.md`, `0002-<slug>.md`, etc.

### Configuration management rule (required for agents)

- When introducing or changing configuration options, follow the unified runtime config design in `docs/designs/0004-unified-runtime-config.md` so config is centrally managed and organized.
- Do not add ad-hoc environment variables or scattered config flags that bypass the unified configuration system.

## Platform Assumptions

- Supported OS: Linux only
- Baseline kernel: Linux 5.10.x (no need to support versions < 5.10)

## Development Environment Setup

### Build Commands

#### C++ Core (Bazel) and Python Extension
```bash
# Build all.
#  BUILD_CORE means cxx files in core/ and ./daemon
#  BUILD_EXTENSION means cxx files in tensorcast/csrc and the output is tensorcast._C
# Always should run this command when you modify any cxx files and
# you want to test the changes in the python code.
BUILD_CORE=1 BUILD_EXTENSION=1 python -vvv setup.py build_ext

# Build and run tests
# Tests are now colocated with their implementation
# Examples:
bazel test //core/store:store_engine_test
bazel test //core/communicator/engine:tcp_engine_test
bazel test //core/store/materialization/dataplane:disk_loader_streaming_buffer_test
```

#### Bazel Quiet / Reduced Output
Bazel does not support the `-q` parameter (do not use it). To reduce build/test log noise, use the following composable options:

```bash
# Build quietly: hide progress and loading info, only show warnings and errors
bazel build //daemon:tensorcast_daemon \
  --noshow_progress --noshow_loading_progress \
  --ui_event_filters=warning,error

# Run tests with minimal output: only show failure details, reduce general logging
bazel test //daemon:session_lifecycle_test \
  --test_env=TENSORCAST_CUDA_BACKEND=fake \
  --test_output=errors \
  --noshow_progress --noshow_loading_progress \
  --ui_event_filters=warning,error
```

#### CUDA Backend (Runtime Selection)
TensorCast ships a **single binary** that supports both CUDA backends:
- `real` (default)
- `fake` (TEST ONLY; simulated CUDA for development and running tests without GPU hardware)

Backend selection is **runtime**, via `TENSORCAST_CUDA_BACKEND`:
- Unset / `real`: use the real backend.
- `fake`: allowed only in recognized test environments (fails fast otherwise). Signals: Bazel tests set `TEST_SRCDIR`/`TEST_TMPDIR`; PyTest sets `PYTEST_CURRENT_TEST`.

```bash
# Build Python extension (single binary supports real/fake at runtime)
BUILD_CORE=1 BUILD_EXTENSION=1 python setup.py build_ext

# Run Python tests with fake CUDA backend
TENSORCAST_CUDA_BACKEND=fake pytest tests/python/...

# Run C++ tests with fake CUDA backend
# Select fake explicitly via test env:
bazel test //core/store:store_engine_test --test_env=TENSORCAST_CUDA_BACKEND=fake
bazel test //core/communicator/engine:gpu_ce_test --test_env=TENSORCAST_CUDA_BACKEND=fake

# To run with real CUDA, leave the env unset (or set TENSORCAST_CUDA_BACKEND=real):
bazel test //daemon:grpc_service_impl_registration_test
```

### Code Quality and Linting

#### C++ Code Formatting
```bash
# It's not necessary to add other arguments to the command, just run it directly
clang-tidy ./core/xxx.cc
```

#### Python Code Quality
```bash
# Run Python linting (After you write code, run this command to check if your code is correct)
ruff check .
ruff format .

# Type checking
pyright ./tensorcast
mypy ./tensorcast
```

### Protocol Buffer Code Generation

TensorCast uses Buf for proto management and Python code generation, with Bazel for C++.

**CRITICAL**: After modifying any `.proto` file, run:
```bash
# Generate Python stubs via Buf and build C++ headers via Bazel
bash tools/build_proto_python.sh
```

Buf helper targets:
```bash
# Format and rewrite .proto files in-place
bazel run @rules_buf_toolchains//:buf -- format ./proto -w

# Lint protos in //proto
bazel test //proto/... --test_output=streamed
```

Note: Communicator config proto package is `tensorcast.communicator` and is consumed directly by C++.
The daemon loads communicator config from a YAML/JSON file (see `--comm_config_path`).

### Common Build Issues

1. **Protocol buffer changes not reflected**: Always run `bash tools/build_proto_python.sh` after modifying `.proto` files
2. **C++ changes not visible in Python**: Ensure both `BUILD_CORE=1` and `BUILD_EXTENSION=1` are set
3. **Clean build needed**: Run `bazel clean --expunge` and `rm -rf build/` for a complete clean build

### Third-Party Dependencies Architecture

```
MODULE.bazel   ─▶  Declares deps (bazel_dep for BCR, http_archive for CUDA/PyPI)
     │              http_archive uses build_file = "@//third_party/<lib>:BUILD"
     ▼
third_party/   ─▶  BUILD files defining cc_library targets (no source code here)
     │
     ▼
./external/    ─▶  Actual headers & sources (populated after bazel build)
```

**Mapping rule**: Each `./third_party/<lib>/BUILD` is the Bazel-compatible wrapper for a dependency fetched in `MODULE.bazel` (via `bazel_dep` or `http_archive`); the real files live under `./external/<lib>+/...` after a Bazel build.

**To explore a third-party library**: look in `./external/`, not `third_party/`.

#### Header Paths in `./external/`

| Library       | Header Path                                                   |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| CUDA Runtime  | `+_repo_rules+cudart/nvidia/cuda_runtime/include/`            |
| NCCL          | `+_repo_rules+nccl/nvidia/nccl/include/`                      |
| LibTorch      | `+_repo_rules+libtorch/torch/include/`                        |
| Abseil        | `abseil-cpp+/absl/`                                           |
| Folly         | `folly+/folly/`                                               |
| gRPC          | `grpc+/include/grpcpp/`                                       |
| nlohmann_json | `nlohmann_json+/include/nlohmann/`                            |
| Catch2        | `catch2+/src/catch2/`                                         |

Pattern: `http_archive` → `+_repo_rules+<name>/...`, BCR modules → `<name>+/...`

#### Discovery Commands

```bash
ls ./external/                              # List all deps
ls ./external/<lib>+/                       # Explore BCR module
find ./external -name "header.h"            # Search for header
cat third_party/<lib>/BUILD                 # Check target definitions
```

**Note**: Run `bazel build //...` first if `./external/` is empty.

## Coding Standards

### Package & Directory Structure

- Mirror directories to namespaces/packages.
- C++: Derive namespaces from paths and open matching nested namespaces. Avoid file-scope `using namespace`.
  - `core/a/b/c` → `tensorcast::a::b::c` (drop `core`).
  - `daemon/a/b` → `tensorcast::daemon::a::b` (keep `daemon`).
  - Tests (`*_test.cc`): allow narrow `using` (e.g., `using a::b::Symbol;`).
- Qualification rules:
  - Inside `core/` and `daemon/`, omit the outer `tensorcast::` unless leaving the root or to disambiguate.
  - Inside `core/store/**`, treat it as `tensorcast::store` and also omit `store::`; refer directly to sub-namespaces (e.g., `loading::ReplicaHandle`).
- Examples:
  - Good: `loading::ReplicaHandle`, `replica::Replica::create(...)`, `communicator::misc::GB`, `grpc::ServiceImpl` (inside daemon).
  - Avoid: `tensorcast::store::loading::ReplicaHandle`, `tensorcast::store::replica::Replica::create(...)`, `tensorcast::communicator::misc::GB`, `tensorcast::daemon::grpc::ServiceImpl`.

### C++ Guidelines

#### Includes vs. Forward Declarations
- Avoid forward declarations; include the correct headers for any types used in headers and translation units.
- Follow include-what-you-use: include the minimal header that directly provides the symbols you reference.

#### UMA V3 canonical headers (required)
- Use canonical headers after UMA V3 final cutover. Legacy and alias headers are forbidden in new/modified code:
  - `core/common/memory/virtual_address_space.h` (canonical; DVMP removed)
  - `core/store/replica/unified_memory_authority.h` (canonical; alias under `core/store/uma/*` removed)
  - `core/store/replica/memory_export_registry.h` (canonical; replaces `chunk_export_service.h`)
- The helper script `tools/lint/check_uma_aliases.sh` enforces this policy (error-level) and fails on legacy includes.

#### C++ Naming Conventions
- **Variables/Functions**: `snake_case`
- **Classes/Structs**: `PascalCase`
- **Files/Directories**: `snake_case`
- Apply these rules to every C++ symbol in the repo—code, tests, tooling, and any documentation (designs/plans/READMEs) that names an API.

#### Async Concurrency (Folly)
- Use `tensorcast::common::AsyncRuntime` + `folly::SemiFuture`/`folly::Future` (and `ReadySignal<T>` for completion-driven fan-out); avoid `std::thread/std::async`, detached threads, and polling, and always bind work to an executor with `.via(...)`.
- **Executor selection rules (required)**:
  - `cpu_executor()` and `serial_executor()` must stay non-blocking: no `CondVar::Wait*`, `folly::Future::get()/wait()`, `CopyHandle::wait()`, `sleep*`, `cuda*Synchronize`, or IO.
  - `blocking_executor()` is the only place where blocking waits/IO are allowed, and they must be bounded (timeout/deadline) and return an error on expiry.
- **Avoid thread-pool starvation deadlocks (required)**:
  - If code schedules work onto executor **E** and waits for that work to make progress (producer/consumer, fan-out/join, callbacks releasing resources, etc.), the waiting/consumer must not run on an **E** worker thread.
  - Concurrency limiting (per-GPU/per-artifact gates, schedulers, backpressure) must be async (`folly::Promise`/`SemiFuture`, async semaphores, etc.); do not block shared worker threads waiting for “slots”.
- **Make hangs fail-fast (preferred, especially in tests/stress)**:
  - Add progress counters + periodic “no progress” warnings (include queue depth/inflight counts) and convert sustained stalls into `absl::DeadlineExceededError`/`absl::UnavailableError`.

### Bazel BUILD Rules
- **One logical unit per target** - Each class or related functions group gets its own `cc_library`
- **Default private visibility** - Only expose true public APIs
- **Consistent naming** - Use `_lib` suffix for libraries, `_test` for tests, `_binary` for binaries
- Always use `sc_cc_library` and `sc_header_only_library` instead of `cc_library` (sc_cc_library has already included the common dependencies of absl/log, absl/status, absl/status:statusor)
- **Resolve missing headers via BUILD deps first** - When a header appears "missing", fix the Bazel BUILD dependencies by adding the precise library that exports the header to the target's `deps`. Do not rely on global include paths or accidental transitive includes; wire dependencies explicitly in BUILD files.

### Build & Dependencies
- **Language**: C++20 standard (No compatibility shims)
- **Build System**: Bazel with Clang18 (Dependencies are on MODULE.bazel)
- **Common Deps**: absl, folly, catch2, nlohmann_json
- **Prefer absl/folly over custom utils**: Use existing utilities from Abseil and Folly instead of writing custom helpers.

#### Code Style
- Prefer modern C++ features and language standards. No compatibility shims.
- **String formatting**: Prefer `std::format` (C++20, `#include <format>`) over `absl::StrFormat`; avoid unnecessary `.c_str()` / `.data()` when formatting (clang-tidy: `modernize-use-std-format`).
- **Functions**: Short (<20 lines), single purpose, verb-based names
- **Early Returns**: Use guard clauses to avoid nesting
- **Parameters**: Use structs for multiple params/returns
- **Immutability**: Prefer `const` and `constexpr`
- **RAII**: Always use for resource management
- **Integer types**: Avoid `short`/`long`/`long long`; prefer fixed-width `std::intXX_t`/`std::uintXX_t` instead.
- **Logging**: Use `LOG` for logging, `VLOG` for verbose logging, `PLOG` for error messages with `errno`
- **Assertions**: Use `ABSL_CHECK` for assertions, `ABSL_CHECK_OK` for assertions that return statuses
- Statement should be inside braces

#### Best Practices
- **Error Handling**: Use `absl::Status` or `absl::StatusOr<T>`; `absl::ErrnoToStatus` to convert errno to status
- **Never ignore Status**: Do not discard `absl::Status`/`absl::StatusOr` results (avoid `(void)expr`). For invariants, assert with `ABSL_CHECK_OK(...)`. For recoverable or expected errors, handle/log/propagate them explicitly and continue safely when possible.
- **Errno handling policy**: Avoid direct use of `errno`, `strerror`, and `perror`. Prefer `absl::ErrnoToStatus` for converting OS errors to statuses and `PLOG(...)` for logging errors that include `errno` safely.

```cpp
// Bad
int fd = open(path.c_str(), O_RDONLY);
if (fd < 0) {
  LOG(ERROR) << "open failed: " << strerror(errno);
  return absl::ErrnoToStatus(errno, "open failed");
}

// Good
int fd = open(path.c_str(), O_RDONLY);
if (fd < 0) {
  PLOG(ERROR) << "open failed";            // logs message with errno string
  return absl::ErrnoToStatus(errno, "open failed");
}
```

#### Logging (C++)
- `LOG(ERROR)`: Invariants/consistency risks or crashes (e.g., background task threw, checkpoint offset mismatch, fatal loop crashes).
- `LOG(WARNING)`: Recoverable but user‑visible failures (e.g., lease create/release failures, unload failures, GS sync/keepalive/remote‑access toggle failures).
- `LOG(INFO)`: One‑time milestones and service summaries (engine/comm init, server ready, successful registration summary).
- `VLOG(1)`: Flow‑level debug; avoid in hot loops.
- `VLOG(2+)`: Inner‑loop/high‑frequency traces only.
- `PLOG(level)`: Use when OS/syscalls fail and `errno` should be included.
- **Testing**: Catch2 framework with Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- **Concurrency**: Use absl thread annotations (`ABSL_GUARDED_BY`, etc.)
- **Documentation**: Doxygen style for public APIs
 - **Pointer annotations**: Prefer `std::unique_ptr` over `std::shared_ptr`. When using pointers, annotate intent with GSL: use `gsl::not_null<>` for non-null, non-owning pointers and `gsl::owner<>` for owning pointers. Constrain pointers at the type level wherever possible.
 - **not_null dereference**: For `gsl::not_null<T*>` and `gsl::not_null<std::shared_ptr<T>>`, use `var->member` instead of `var.get()->member`; prefer `operator->` for readability.

### Python Guidelines
- **Python Environment**: MUST use `source .venv/bin/activate` to activate the virtual environment before running any python scripts (including pytest tests)
- **Package Management**: `uv` (MUST) NOT use `pip`. Use `uv pip install <package>` to install packages.
- **Testing**: `pytest` in `tests/python/`; run with `pytest tests/python/...`
- **Type Checking & Linting**: `mypy` and `ruff`
  - `mypy ./tensorcast`
  - `ruff check .` and `ruff format .`
- **Data Modeling**: Prefer Pydantic models over raw dictionaries for validation

#### Python Naming Conventions
- **Files/Directories**: `snake_case` (e.g., `tensorcast/global_store/manager.py`)
- **Variables/Functions**: `snake_case`
- **Classes**: `PascalCase`
- **Constants**: `ALL_CAPS`

#### Core Principles
- **Functional programming**: Prefer functional, declarative style over classes where possible
- **Type safety**:
  - Try your best to make the code type safe
  - Always use type hints for function signatures
- **Modern Python**: Use Python 3.10+ features freely

#### Type Safety Requirements
- Use type hints for ALL function parameters and return values
- Prefer `T | None` over `Optional[T]`, `dict[T]` over `Dict[T]`
- Avoid dynamic attribute access (`getattr`, `hasattr`, `setattr`)
- Avoid Optional types unless necessary
- Avoid `isinstance` checks unless truly necessary; rely on precise type hints and intentional polymorphism instead of runtime type checks
- Prefer Pydantic models over raw dictionaries for any use cases

#### Error Handling
- Use `logger.exception()` instead of `logger.error()` for exceptions with traceback
- Handle errors early with guard clauses and early returns
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Prefer `contextlib.suppress` over `try/except` for suppressing exceptions


#### Protobuf Imports
- Import generated protobuf modules using the canonical package path `tensorcast.proto.<pkg>.v1`.
- Example: `from tensorcast.proto.config.v1 import client_config_pb2`

#### Best Practices
- Prefer decomposition and iteration over duplication
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use explicit, named imports for utilities
- Use `dataclasses` or Pydantic models for complex data structures
- Binding: Use absolute imports for all in-repo modules: `from tensorcast.xxx.yyy import Z`. NEVER use relative imports (`from .xxx import Z`, `from ..yyy import Z`).


### Commenting & Self-Documentation
- Use comments to capture what and why, not how. Focus on intent, invariants, and decision rationale; the code should express the implementation.
- Make code self-explanatory.


## Development Principles

### Code Fixing and Testing
- When debugging or fixing tests—or investigating/fixing any issue—first identify the root cause and implement the fundamental solution. Make tests reflect the real, reasonable system behavior rather than bending the system to fit an original test, and avoid quick or convenient workarounds. Never modify the system merely to make a test pass; find the root cause and design a fundamental fix, aiming for the minimal sufficient change. When a test must change, update it to assert the clearly documented, reasonable system behavior. Solve from a system-wide perspective, aiming for globally optimal changes, not local patches.

### Explicit Planning and Fallbacks
- Prefer explicit plans over implicit fallbacks. Known cases should be classified before execution, and the chosen behavior should be intentional for that scenario.
- Fallbacks are acceptable only when they are part of the plan or clearly requested by configuration. Do not use a broad fallback to hide unexpected states, contract violations, or partial failures.
- When an unplanned situation is encountered, fail with a clear error rather than silently switching to a slower or less precise path.
