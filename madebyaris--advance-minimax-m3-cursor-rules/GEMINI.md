> Language-agnostic programming patterns: SOLID, design patterns, clean code, and architecture. Load when refactoring, designing abstractions, or reviewing structure — not for everyday syntax.


# Language-Agnostic Programming Patterns

Universal principles for structure, naming, architecture, and testing — applicable across all languages.

Load this rule when refactoring modules, designing abstractions, reviewing architecture, or choosing patterns. For day-to-day coding workflow (read-before-edit, CI discovery, minimal diff, verification), the always-on core **Code Discipline** section is canonical — do not duplicate it here. For the judgment layer — root-cause method, simplicity taste, test integrity — load `fable5-coding-craft` alongside this rule.

## Pattern Judgment (Read First)

Everything below is vocabulary, not a checklist. Frontier-quality code applies patterns *reactively* — when the code's actual pain demands them — never proactively because a situation pattern-matches a textbook example.

- Every pattern has a cost: indirection, a new concept for readers, more files to trace through. Apply one only when the pain it removes is already present, not predicted.
- The strongest signal for an abstraction is the **third occurrence** of real duplication with identical reasons to change. Two similar blocks that change for different reasons are not duplication — unifying them couples things that must stay free.
- SOLID violations matter when they cause observed friction (a class you cannot test, a switch you keep re-editing). A small concrete class that "violates SRP" but has never needed to change is fine code — leave it alone.
- The best architecture for most changes is the one the repo already has. Pattern fluency is mostly for *reading* existing designs and for naming the structure a refactor is already growing toward.
- When reviewing, flag pattern *overuse* with the same severity as pattern absence: a Strategy with one strategy, a Factory with one product, or an interface with one implementation is indirection without payoff.

---

## Change Discipline

- Solve the requested problem with the smallest vertical slice; expand only after it works.
- Prefer extending existing modules over creating parallel implementations.
- When adding a dependency, confirm the repo does not already solve the same need.
- Keep public surfaces stable unless the task explicitly requires a breaking change.
- Leave the codebase in a compilable, testable state after each meaningful step.

## SOLID Principles

### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
A class/module should have only one reason to change.

**Apply when:**
- A function does multiple unrelated things
- A class has too many dependencies
- Changes in one area affect unrelated code

**Example Pattern:**
```
Bad:  UserService handles auth, profile, notifications, and billing
Good: AuthService, ProfileService, NotificationService, BillingService
```

### Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
Open for extension, closed for modification.

**Apply when:**
- Adding new features requires modifying existing code
- Switch statements grow with each new type
- Core logic changes for edge cases

**Example Pattern:**
```
Bad:  if type == "email" ... elif type == "sms" ... elif type == "push" ...
Good: NotificationStrategy interface with EmailStrategy, SMSStrategy, PushStrategy
```

### Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.

**Apply when:**
- Derived classes override behavior in unexpected ways
- Code checks for specific types before operating
- Inheritance creates illogical hierarchies

**Example Pattern:**
```
Bad:  Square extends Rectangle but can't independently set width/height
Good: Both Square and Rectangle implement Shape interface
```

### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
Clients shouldn't depend on interfaces they don't use.

**Apply when:**
- Classes implement methods they don't need
- Interfaces have too many methods
- Changes affect many unrelated implementations

**Example Pattern:**
```
Bad:  Animal interface with fly(), swim(), walk() - Penguin can't fly
Good: Flyable, Swimmable, Walkable interfaces
```

### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
Depend on abstractions, not concretions.

**Apply when:**
- High-level modules import low-level modules directly
- Changing database/service requires code changes
- Testing requires real dependencies

**Example Pattern:**
```
Bad:  UserService directly imports MySQLDatabase
Good: UserService depends on DatabaseInterface, injected at runtime
```

## Common Design Patterns

### Creational Patterns

#### Factory Pattern
Use when object creation logic is complex or needs to be centralized.

```
When to use:
- Multiple similar objects with different configurations
- Object creation depends on runtime conditions
- Hiding complex initialization logic
```

#### Builder Pattern
Use for constructing complex objects step by step.

```
When to use:
- Objects with many optional parameters
- Complex configuration requirements
- Need for immutable objects with many fields
```

#### Singleton Pattern
Use sparingly for truly global, single-instance resources.

```
When to use:
- Configuration managers
- Connection pools
- Logger instances

Avoid when:
- It's just for convenience (use DI instead)
- Testing would be difficult
- Multiple instances might be needed later
```

### Structural Patterns

#### Adapter Pattern
Convert one interface to another that clients expect.

```
When to use:
- Integrating third-party libraries
- Working with legacy code
- Unifying different data sources
```

#### Decorator Pattern
Add behavior to objects dynamically.

```
When to use:
- Adding features without subclassing
- Composable behaviors
- Middleware-like patterns
```

#### Facade Pattern
Provide a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.

```
When to use:
- Simplifying complex library usage
- Creating API boundaries
- Reducing coupling between layers
```

### Behavioral Patterns

#### Strategy Pattern
Define a family of interchangeable algorithms.

```
When to use:
- Multiple algorithms for the same task
- Runtime algorithm selection
- Avoiding complex conditionals
```

#### Observer Pattern
Notify dependents of state changes.

```
When to use:
- Event-driven systems
- Pub/sub messaging
- Reactive data flows
```

#### Command Pattern
Encapsulate requests as objects.

```
When to use:
- Undo/redo functionality
- Queueing operations
- Macro recording
```

## Clean Code Principles

### Naming Conventions

#### Variables and Functions
- Use intention-revealing names
- Avoid abbreviations unless universally understood
- Be consistent with terminology

```
Bad:  d, tmp, data, info, process()
Good: elapsedTimeInDays, userProfile, activeConnections, validatePayment()
```

#### Booleans
- Use positive names (avoid double negatives)
- Start with is/has/can/should

```
Bad:  notDisabled, flag, status
Good: isEnabled, hasPermission, canEdit, shouldRefresh
```

#### Functions
- Use verbs for actions
- Be specific about what they do

```
Bad:  handle(), process(), manage()
Good: validateUserInput(), calculateTotalPrice(), sendConfirmationEmail()
```

### Function Design

#### Keep Functions Small
- Do one thing well
- 5-20 lines is ideal
- If you can't name it well, it's probably doing too much

#### Limit Parameters
- 0-3 parameters is ideal
- Use objects for more
- Consider builder pattern for complex initialization

#### Avoid Side Effects
- Functions should be predictable
- Clearly document mutations
- Prefer pure functions when possible

### Comments

#### When to Comment
- Explain WHY, not WHAT
- Document public APIs
- Warn about non-obvious behavior
- Link to external resources/tickets

#### When NOT to Comment
- Explaining what code does (make code clearer instead)
- Commented-out code (delete it)
- Redundant descriptions
- TODOs without tickets

```
Bad:  // increment counter by 1
      counter += 1;

Good: // Retry limit based on SLA requirements (see JIRA-1234)
      MAX_RETRIES = 3;
```

### Error Handling

Match the repo's existing error style (exceptions, `Result`/`error`, error codes, etc.) before introducing a new pattern.

#### Fail Fast
- Validate inputs early
- Throw exceptions for unexpected states
- Don't swallow errors silently

#### Error Messages
- Include context (what was being done)
- Include relevant values
- Suggest remediation when possible

```
Bad:  "Error occurred"
Good: "Failed to connect to database 'users' at localhost:5432: Connection refused. Check if PostgreSQL is running."
```

#### Error Categories
1. **Recoverable**: Retry, fallback, or prompt user
2. **Validation**: Return clear error to caller
3. **Programming**: Fail fast, fix the bug
4. **System**: Log, alert, graceful degradation

## Architecture Patterns

### Layered Architecture
```
Presentation → Business Logic → Data Access → Database
```
- Each layer only talks to adjacent layers
- Dependencies flow downward

### Clean Architecture
```
Entities → Use Cases → Controllers → Frameworks
```
- Business rules at the center
- Frameworks/DB at the edges
- Dependency rule: inward only

### Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters)
```
[Adapters] → [Ports] → [Core Domain] ← [Ports] ← [Adapters]
```
- Core domain is isolated
- Ports define interfaces
- Adapters implement external concerns

### When to Choose What
- **Layered**: Simple CRUD apps, rapid development
- **Clean**: Complex business logic, long-lived systems
- **Hexagonal**: Multiple interfaces, testability focus

## Testing Principles

### Test Pyramid
```
     /\
    /  \   E2E Tests (few)
   /----\  Integration Tests (some)
  /------\ Unit Tests (many)
```

### Unit Tests
- Test one thing in isolation
- Fast and deterministic
- Mock external dependencies

### Integration Tests
- Test component interactions
- Use real (or realistic) dependencies
- Focus on boundaries

### End-to-End Tests
- Test complete user flows
- Slowest and most brittle
- Use for critical paths only

### Test Quality
- Tests are documentation
- One assertion per test when possible
- Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Test behavior, not implementation

## Performance Principles

### Measure First
- Don't optimize prematurely
- Profile before changing
- Set performance budgets

### Common Optimizations
- **Caching**: Memoization, HTTP caching, query caching
- **Batching**: Combine multiple operations
- **Lazy Loading**: Defer until needed
- **Pagination**: Don't load everything at once

### Database Performance
- Index frequently queried columns
- Avoid N+1 queries
- Use connection pooling
- Consider read replicas for scale

## Security Best Practices

### Input Validation
- Validate all external input
- Whitelist, don't blacklist
- Sanitize before use

### Authentication
- Use established libraries
- Hash passwords with strong algorithms
- Implement rate limiting
- Use HTTPS everywhere

### Authorization
- Check permissions on every request
- Fail closed (deny by default)
- Log access attempts

### Data Protection
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- Use parameterized queries
- Don't log sensitive information
- Implement proper session management

## Code Organization

### Module Structure
```
Feature-based (preferred for larger apps):
/features
  /auth
    - service
    - controller
    - repository
  /products
    - service
    - controller
    - repository

Layer-based (simpler for smaller apps):
/controllers
/services
/repositories
```

### File Naming
- Consistent conventions across project
- Reflect content purpose
- Include type suffix when helpful (e.g., `.service`, `.controller`)

### Import Organization
1. Standard library
2. Third-party packages
3. Local modules
4. Relative imports

## Code Review Heuristics

Use when reviewing diffs, PRs, or your own work before closeout. Complements core **Code Discipline** and the always-on verification contract.

### Correctness
- Does the change solve the stated problem, or only a symptom?
- Are edge cases handled the way this repo handles them (null/empty, auth, timeouts)?
- Do error paths propagate or log usefully — no silent swallowing?
- If behavior changed, are callers, tests, and docs updated?

### Scope & maintainability
- Is the diff the smallest honest fix? Any unrelated refactors or drive-by renames?
- Does new code match naming, layering, and error style of surrounding files?
- New abstraction justified by reuse, or premature?
- New dependency necessary, or does the repo already cover the need?

### Tests & verification
- Is there a test or check proportional to the risk? If not, is that gap called out as `unverified`?
- Do tests assert behavior, not implementation details?
- Would CI scripts in this repo catch a regression from this change?

### Security & data
- User/external input validated and parameterized (SQL, shell, HTML)?
- Secrets, tokens, or PII absent from logs, commits, and client bundles?
- AuthZ checked on the server for every sensitive action — not only UI gating?

### Performance (when relevant)
- N+1 queries, unbounded loops, or loading entire datasets into memory?
- Caching added only where measured or clearly hot-path?

### Review output shape
Keep feedback actionable: **issue → impact → suggested fix**. Separate blocking concerns from nits. Prefer pointing to existing repo patterns over generic style opinions.
