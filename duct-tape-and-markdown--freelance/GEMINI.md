# Freelance

Graph-based workflow enforcement for AI coding agents.

## Development

- `npm run build` — compile TypeScript
- `npm test` — run all tests
- `npm run dev` — run in development mode

After a non-trivial batch of code changes (multiple files or a cohesive multi-step edit), run `/simplify` before reporting the task complete. Skip for single-line fixes, test-only tweaks, or pure config/docs edits.

## Design iteration

When iterating on a design (proposal, issue body, new mode/option, added column), check each addition against existing system invariants **before** drafting. If the case the addition addresses isn't expressible in the current schema or types, the addition is solving an imaginary problem — kill it at the premise, not at review. Memory invariants live in `docs/memory-intent.md` (architectural qualities + anti-patterns) and in the schemas under `src/memory/` + `src/schema/`; read both before proposing a new mode, column, or tool. Concrete example: `memory_emit` requires `sources: [min 1]` on every proposition, so there is no "non-source-aligned" proposition — a prune mode scoped to that case would be solving a case the schema makes malformed.

## Feature authoring checklist

Before declaring a feature done, walk the five dimensions — otherwise the first pass will miss adjacent surfaces and take multiple rounds to catch up. This is a prompt for Claude as much as a human reference.

- **Agent journey.** What does the LLM see on discovery (e.g. `freelance_guide <topic>`), on successful use (response shape, suggested tools, next edges), and on recovery (blocked vs. structural error, recovery hint)? Trace it end-to-end.
- **Operator journey.** Human at the shell with `freelance <verb>`. JSON output is the wire format; does it parse cleanly under `jq`? What does a debugging operator see on disk under `.freelance/`?
- **Adjacent-surface sweep.** Touch each relevant surface or consciously skip:
  - `docs/decisions.md` if the feature names a cross-file invariant.
  - `plugins/freelance/skills/freelance/SKILL.md` + `templates/skills/freelance/SKILL.md` (byte-identical — `plugin-manifest.test.ts` enforces) if the skill protocol changes.
  - CLI verb descriptions / tool descriptions if behavior changes.
  - Error messages that reference the new surface where the operator is likely to hit them.
  - Graph schema (`src/schema/`) if a new field or validation applies.
  - `freelance validate` if there's a new lint rule.
  - `freelance init` templates if a starter should demonstrate the pattern.
- **Migration.** Existing on-disk records (traversal JSON, memory.db rows), existing scripts calling the verb, existing graph yaml. Does the change read correctly against pre-feature state, or is a migration needed?
- **Observability.** How do success, failure, and ambiguous cases surface? Structured error envelope (`errorKind: "blocked" | "structural"`), exit codes, breadcrumbs on stderr — pick the right channel for each.

Not a PR template — keep it inline so it's visible during authoring, not a checkbox exercise on submit.

## WHY-comments vs decisions log

Inline WHY comments are fine when a reader scanning *this file* needs the context at the point of reading: a local invariant, a subtle workaround, a non-obvious choice the code itself can't express. When the WHY has cross-file implications — names an invariant other modules rely on, documents a tradeoff a future change elsewhere would break, or captures a decision deliberated in an issue thread — elevate to `docs/decisions.md` and optionally cross-link from the inline comment.

The test: could a contributor refactoring a sibling file violate the invariant without reading this comment? If yes, it belongs in the decisions log, not buried as a comment in one file. Narrating what the code does, referencing the current task/PR, or summarizing obvious flow is never a valid comment — delete on sight.

**After closing a batch of related issues on a shared rationale, scan whether the rationale belongs in the decisions log as a standalone entry.** Per-issue close comments are complete on their own terms but don't compound — the next contributor proposing a similar feature has no single anchor to cite. If the same posture appeared across three-plus closures (a common stop-line, a rejected anti-pattern, a named invariant), that's the signal to promote it to a decisions entry and cross-link the closures from it.

## Refactor backlog

`/simplify` surfaces findings that aren't always in-scope to fix on the current PR. Anything you decide NOT to fix — out-of-scope, pre-existing, low impact on this path — append as a one-line entry to `docs/debt.md`: `<file>:<line> — <finding> — <rationale for skipping>`. Flat list, no categories, no status column; keep append cheap. Mark entries done by deleting them. Before opening a refactor PR, scan the file for candidates.

## Releases

npm publishing is **CI-driven by GitHub Releases** (`.github/workflows/publish.yml` fires on `release: published` and runs `npm publish --provenance`). Do NOT `npm publish` from a local machine — the workflow uses an OIDC token and provenance that local publishes won't produce.

Flow for a patch release (e.g. 1.3.2 → 1.3.3):

1. Graduate `[Unreleased]` in `CHANGELOG.md` to `[<version>] - YYYY-MM-DD`. Leave a fresh empty `[Unreleased]` above it.
2. `npm version patch --no-git-tag-version` — bumps `package.json` + `package-lock.json`, runs the `version` script which invokes `scripts/sync-plugin-version.mjs` to rewrite `plugin.json` and `marketplace.json`.
3. The `version` script only `git add`s `plugin.json` — **manually stage the rest**: `git add CHANGELOG.md package.json package-lock.json .claude-plugin/marketplace.json`.
4. `git commit -m "release: <version>"` and `git tag v<version>`. A Biome-format pre-commit hook runs; if it finds unformatted files the commit is rejected — run `npx biome format --write <files>` (or `npx biome check --write .`) and retry **before** tagging. If a tag got created against the previous commit because of a silent commit failure, delete it (`git tag -d v<version>`, plus `git push origin :v<version>` if it's already on the remote) and re-tag after the real release commit lands.
5. Push main + tag: `git push origin main v<version>`. Verify first: `git log --oneline -1 v<version>` should point at the `release: <version>` commit.
6. `gh release create v<version> --title "v<version>" --notes "$(...)"` — CI workflow picks this up and publishes to npm.

### After a release: the plugin nudge is the CLI update signal

Post-MCP (#121), the plugin no longer launches a server — users run `freelance` from their shell. `plugins/freelance/hooks/nudge.mjs` reads `plugin.json#version` on SessionStart, probes `freelance --version`, and emits a `systemMessage` recommending `npm install -g freelance-mcp@<plugin-version>` when the CLI is missing or older than the plugin. Comparison is asymmetric — CLI ahead of plugin stays silent.

Practical consequence: every release via the flow above bumps `plugin.json` + `marketplace.json` (via `sync-plugin-version.mjs`), and that bump carries through `/plugin update` to become an install prompt in each user's next session. Plugin version is effectively the authoritative CLI version users should be on. This is the replacement for the pre-1.4 `.mcp.json` exact-pin mechanism.

Historical context: pre-1.4, `.mcp.json` pinned `freelance-mcp@<exact-version>` rather than `^<major>` because npx keys its `_npx/<hash>` cache by the raw spec string, so a range reuses any satisfying cached version and never re-resolves (npm/cli#7838, #6804). Exact pinning changed the cache key each release so `/plugin update` delivered the new server. See CHANGELOG [1.3.3] and the file-header comment in `scripts/sync-plugin-version.mjs`. The mechanism is inactive after MCP removal in #121; the nudge above supersedes it.

## Code navigation

Prefer AST-aware tools over plain text search when exploring or refactoring TypeScript:

- **LSP tool** (`LSP`) — use for semantic queries: `goToDefinition`, `findReferences`, `hover`, `documentSymbol`, `workspaceSymbol`, `goToImplementation`, and call hierarchy (`prepareCallHierarchy` / `incomingCalls` / `outgoingCalls`). Better than Grep for "where is X used" or "what does this type resolve to".
- **ast-grep** (`sg` on PATH) — use for structural search/rewrite: `sg run -p '<pattern>' -l ts src/`. Better than Grep when the match depends on syntax shape rather than a literal string (e.g. call sites of a specific method, JSX props, type annotations).

Fall back to Grep only for literal strings, comments, or non-code files.

## Running

### Configuration

Two config files in `.freelance/`, same schema, layered:
- `config.yml` — team-shared (committed)
- `config.local.yml` — machine-specific (gitignored)

Precedence: CLI flags > env vars > config.local.yml > config.yml > defaults

Schema: `workflows` (string[]), `memory.enabled` (bool), `memory.dir` (string), `maxDepth` (number), `hooks.timeoutMs` (number).

Arrays concatenate across files. Scalars use highest-precedence value. Per-field CLI/env/config surface is documented in `src/config.ts` and in the README's Configuration section.

### Graph directory resolution

Graphs load from multiple directories in cascading order (later shadow earlier):

1. `./.freelance` (project-level, if exists)
2. `~/.freelance` (user-level, if exists)
3. Additional dirs from `workflows:` in `config.yml` / `config.local.yml`

Override automatic resolution with repeatable `--workflows <dir>` on any runtime verb.

### Commands

```bash
freelance status                                     # discover loaded graphs + active traversals
freelance start <graphId>                            # begin a traversal
freelance advance <edge>                             # step; emits JSON
freelance inspect [<id>]                             # recover after compaction
freelance validate ./path/to/graphs/                 # author-time check
freelance visualize ./graphs/my.workflow.yaml        # JSON with mermaid inline
freelance init                                       # project setup
```

All runtime verbs emit structured JSON with semantic exit codes. There is no long-running server process — see `docs/decisions.md` § "CLI is the execution surface for agents" and § "MCP server and tool surface deleted".

### Source path resolution

Source bindings in graphs use relative paths; they resolve relative to the **source root**, which defaults to the parent of the first graphsDir. See `docs/decisions.md` § "Source root binds to first graphsDir's parent". Override with `--source-root <path>`.

## Conventions

Durable contracts surfaced across multiple features. If a new feature extends one of these, match the shape; don't re-invent a parallel idiom.

**Keyed-dict fields on traversal responses are always-present, possibly-empty.** `context` and `meta` are `Record<K, V>` on every response — empty `{}` when untouched, never absent. Callers (agents, hooks) read `meta[key]` without null-checking the map. On-disk `TraversalRecord` keeps these optional for storage compactness; the store normalizes at read time with a frozen-empty sentinel (see `EMPTY_META` in `src/state/traversal-store.ts`). New keyed-dict fields follow the same pattern: optional on disk, always-present on the wire.

**Hook cross-layer capabilities flow through `runHooksFor` parameters, surfaced via optional `HookContext` fields.** Hooks can't import the store; host capabilities they need (memory reads, meta writes) are threaded as parameters through `engine.runHooksOnArrival` → `runHooksFor` → `HookContext`. `HookRunner` stays stateless — it holds configuration, not capabilities. Adding a new capability = add a parameter on `runHooksFor` and an optional field on `HookContext` (`src/engine/hooks.ts`). Don't open a back door by reaching into the store from inside a hook body.

**`splitKeyValue` is the single CLI primitive for `key=value` flags.** `--meta`, `--filter`, and `context set` all parse `key=value` pairs. One helper in `src/cli/output.ts` (co-located with `parseIntArg` and other cross-feature CLI primitives) splits on the first `=`, validates a non-empty key, and throws a consistent error. Value handling (string-only for meta, JSON-coerced for context, byte-capped for meta via `parseMetaPairs`) stays at the caller — domain-specific — but the split + empty-key guard is shared.

## Project structure

- `src/schema/` — Zod schemas for graph definitions (single source of truth for types + validation)
- `src/evaluator.ts` — Expression evaluator for edge conditions and validations; exports `CONTEXT_PATH_PATTERN` + `resolveContextPath` for hook arg resolution
- `src/loader.ts` — YAML graph loader with structural validation; threads `resolveGraphHooks` results into `ValidatedGraph.hookResolutions`
- `src/hook-resolution.ts` — Load-time hook path resolver: classifies `onEnter[].call` as built-in name or local script path, stats scripts, merges into the `ValidatedGraph`
- `src/compose.ts` — **Composition root.** Single `composeRuntime` factory that wires state backend → memory store → hook runner → traversal store and returns a `Runtime` with an idempotent `close()`. Also owns `buildMemoryStore` (shared with CLI memory commands) and `migrateLegacyLayout` (transparent `.state/` → flat layout migration). Both `src/server.ts` and `src/cli/setup.ts` call `composeRuntime`.
- `src/engine/` — Core traversal engine, decomposed into focused modules:
  - `engine.ts` — Orchestrator (async `start`, async `advance` dispatch, reset, contextSet, inspect)
  - `gates.ts` — Pre-advance checks (wait blocking, return schema, validations, edge conditions)
  - `subgraph.ts` — Stack push/pop with context and return mapping; `maybePushSubgraph` fires onEnter hooks for the pushed child's start node
  - `context.ts` — Context updates, strict context enforcement, inspect builders
  - `transitions.ts` — Edge evaluation with default-edge logic
  - `wait.ts` — Wait condition evaluation and timeout handling
  - `returns.ts` — Return schema validation
  - `hooks.ts` — `HookRunner`, `HookContext`, `HookMemoryAccess` narrow read interface, `resolveHookArgs`, timeout + error wrapping. Required injection on `GraphEngineOptions`.
  - `builtin-hooks.ts` — `BUILTIN_HOOKS` map of name → `HookFn` (`memory_status`, `memory_browse`); `requireMemory` guard helper
  - `helpers.ts` — Shared utilities (cloneContext, toNodeInfo)
- `src/state/` — Stateless traversal store (JSON files on disk under `.freelance/traversals/`)
  - `traversal-store.ts` — Multi-traversal management, loads/saves state per operation; owns `setMeta` (merge semantics) and meta enrichment of `inspect` / `advance` / `list` responses
  - `db.ts` — `StateStore` interface + JSON-directory and in-memory backends; `TraversalRecord` carries an optional `meta: Record<string,string>` of opaque caller-supplied lookup tags (Freelance never interprets them — see `freelance_guide meta`); `openStateStore` factory owns the `mkdirSync` (constructor is pure)
- `src/memory/` — Persistent knowledge graph (SQLite under `.freelance/memory/`)
  - `store.ts` — `MemoryStore` constructor takes an already-opened `Db` handle + required `sourceRoot` (I/O lives in `composeRuntime`). Memory is a single flat namespace — no collections. Proposition dedup hashes a normalized form of content (lowercase, whitespace collapse, trailing punctuation strip) so superficial variance doesn't create duplicates; source-file hashing uses the minimal `hashContent` in `sources.ts` where stricter normalization would mask real drift.
  - `db.ts` — `openDatabase` with schema compatibility check
- `src/builder.ts` — Programmatic workflow graph construction (GraphBuilder)
- `src/config.ts` — Unified config loader (config.yml + config.local.yml schema, merging, writing); per-field CLI/env/config surface documented inline
- `src/graph-resolution.ts` — Graph directory resolution and loading (env var, project, user, config cascading)
- `src/cli/` — CLI subcommand handlers (init, validate, visualize, traversals, stateless, memory, config, output, setup)
  - `cli/program.ts` — Commander program construction (imported by `bin.ts`)
  - `cli/setup.ts` — `createTraversalStore` + `createMemoryStore`; layout helpers (`ensureFreelanceDir`, `resolveTraversalsDir`, `memoryDbPathFor`); `resolveMemoryConfig` with symmetric `--memory`/`--no-memory` precedence
  - `cli/memory.ts` — Memory subcommand handlers including `memory reset --confirm` for schema-mismatch recovery
  - `cli/clients.ts` — Client detection (claude-code, cursor, windsurf, cline) and display helpers
- `src/index.ts` — Pure library entry (re-exports, no side effects)
- `src/bin.ts` — CLI bin entry (shebang, imports and runs `program`)
- `templates/` — Starter graph templates and shell completions

## `.freelance/` directory layout

```
.freelance/
├── config.yml           # source (committed)
├── config.local.yml     # source (gitignored)
├── *.workflow.yaml      # source (committed)
├── .gitignore           # auto-generated
├── memory/              # runtime (gitignored) — SQLite db + sidecars
└── traversals/          # runtime (gitignored) — one JSON file per active traversal
```

Legacy `.freelance/.state/` layouts from pre-1.3 installs are auto-migrated on startup — see `migrateLegacyLayout` in `src/compose.ts`.

## Graph definitions

Graph files use `.workflow.yaml` extension. See `test/fixtures/` for examples.
See `src/schema/graph-schema.ts` for the full schema definition.

Nodes support an optional `onEnter: [{ call, args }]` list of hooks that fire on node arrival. See `freelance_guide onenter-hooks` for the full authoring guide, or `src/engine/hooks.ts` for the runner implementation.
