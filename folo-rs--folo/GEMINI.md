# Standard commands

We use the Just command runner for many common commands - look inside *.just files to see the
list of available commands. Some relevant ones are:

* `just build` - build the entire workspace
* `just package=many_cpus build` - build a single package (most commands accept a `package` parameter)
* `just test` - test the entire workspace; this does NOT run doctests, use `just test-docs` for that
* `just docs` - build API documentation

The `package` argument must be the first argument to any `just` command, if used. You can specify it on most commands to scope them down to a specific package instead of running them on the entire repo (which is slow).

Avoid running `just bench` (wall-clock Criterion benchmarks) without explicit confirmation: they
take a lot of time, and the numbers are also noisy and machine-dependent — running them on a
shared machine produces results that should not be acted on. `just test` already runs a single
iteration of every Criterion benchmark to validate that they still execute.

`just bench-cg` (Callgrind / Gungraun) is different: it runs each scenario once under Valgrind's
CPU simulator, so the instruction counts and simulated cache numbers are deterministic and
unaffected by other processes on the machine. It is safe to run `just bench-cg` (or
`just package=foo bench-cg`) any time without asking — including as a smoke test of a new
Callgrind benchmark. The same applies to the `bench-cycles` recipe in packages that still use it.

We generally prefer using Just commands over raw Cargo commands if there is a suitable Just command
defined in one of the *.just files.

Do not execute `just release` - this is a critical tool reserved for human use.

Do not use VS Code tasks, relying instead on `just` and, if necessary, `cargo` commands.

# Validating changes

Validate changes via `just validate-local`. This runs a number of different checks and will
uncover most issues. If you only touched a few packages, scope it to them via `package=foo`.

We operate under a "zero warnings allowed" requirement - fix all warnings that validation generates.

# Multiplatform codebase

This is a multiplatform codebase. In some packages you will find folders named `linux` and
`windows`, which contain platform-specific code. When modifying files of one platform, you
make the equivalent modifications in the other.

When running on a local PC, the operating systme is Windows. When running in GitHub, the operating
system is Linux.

On local PC, you can invoke any Linux commands using the syntax `wsl -e bash -l -c "command"`.
For example, to run the standard validation on both Windows and Linux, execute:

1. `just validate-local`
2. `wsl -e bash -l -c "just validate-local"`

# Facades and abstractions

Some packages like `many_cpus` use a platform abstraction layer (PAL), where an abstraction like
`trait Platform` defined in `packages/many_cpus/src/pal/abstractions/**` has multiple different
implementations:

1. A Windows implementation (`packages/many_cpus/src/pal/windows/**`)
2. A Linux implementation (`packages/many_cpus/src/pal/linux/**`)
3. A mock implementation (`packages/many_cpus/src/pal/mocks.rs`)

Logic code will consume this abstraction via facade types, which can either call into the real
implementation of the build target platform (Windows or Linux) or the mock implementation (only
when building in test mode). The facades are defined in `packages/many_cpus/src/pal/facade/**` and
only exist to be minimal pass-through layers to allow swapping in the mock implementation in tests.

When modifying the API of the PAL, you are expected to make the API changes in the
abstraction, facade and implementation types at the same time, as the API surface must match.

The same pattern may also be used elsewhere (e.g. inside the PAL implementations as a second layer
of abstraction, or in other packages).

# Filesystem structure

We prefer many smaller files over few large files, typically only packing implementation details
and unit tests into the same file but keeping separate API-visible types in separate files (even
if only API-visible inside the same crate).

We prefer to keep the public API relatively flat - even if we create separate Rust modules for
types, we re-export them all at the parent, so while we have modules like
`packages/many_cpus/src/hardware_tracker.rs` the type itself is exported at the crate root as
`many_cpus::HardwareTracker` instead of at the module as `many_cpus::hardware_tracker::HardwareTracker`.

`lib.rs` and `mod.rs` files should only contain API documentation and re-exports. Do not define
constants, helper functions, or other items in these files — move them to dedicated files (e.g.
`constants.rs`) for better filesystem organization.

Inline `mod` blocks defined directly in `lib.rs` / `mod.rs` count as "re-exports" for the purpose
of this rule as long as they only re-export items from other modules (no logic, no constants, no
new type definitions). This is common for `#[doc(hidden)] pub mod __private { pub use ...; }` or
similar grouping modules whose sole purpose is to gather and re-expose existing items under a
distinct namespace.

# Scripting

You can assume PowerShell 7 (`pwsh`) is available on every operating system and environment.

Prefer PowerShell 7 commands to Bash commands, as they are more likely to work. You
will not always be on Linux, so Bash commands might not always work.

# Code style

We limit line length to 100, including API documentation and comments.

There are many Clippy rules defined in the workspace-level `Cargo.toml`.

Follow these even in doctests. Note that Clippy does not actually check doctests! You will need to
manually check what Clippy rules we enable in the workspace-level `Cargo.toml` and follow them in
the inline examples in API documentation.

This applies whenever Clippy-relevant changes are made, including: (a) enabling a new lint, (b)
migrating a pattern from one form to another to satisfy an existing lint, (c) running `cargo
clippy --fix`. After any such change, sweep `///` and `//!` code blocks for the same pattern.
Pay special attention to *mirrored* examples — a standalone `examples/<crate>_readme.rs` paired
with code blocks in `lib.rs` and `README.md` — Clippy only sees the standalone example; the
inline doctest and the README copy must be updated by hand.

# Discarding values

Use `_ = expr;` to discard values, not `let _ = expr;`. The `let` keyword is unnecessary and
triggers `clippy::let_underscore_must_use`. Use `drop(expr)` when you want to explicitly drop a
value that has a destructor.

# Cloning into closures

When cloning a variable to move it into a closure, create a separate scope for the clone instead
of polluting the parent scope with renamed variables. This applies to all closure types: async
blocks, thread spawns, and regular closures.

Bad:

```rust
let handle = mutex.clone();
spawn(async move { handle.something(); });
```

Good:

```rust
spawn({
    let mutex = mutex.clone();
    async move {
        mutex.something();
    }
});
```

The same pattern applies to thread spawning:

```rust
thread::spawn({
    let set = Arc::clone(&set);
    move || {
        set.do_work();
    }
});
```

# Variable shadowing for type conversions

When converting a variable to a different form (e.g. removing a `Pin` wrapper, dereferencing a
pointer to a reference, or re-pinning a reference), prefer shadowing the original variable name
instead of inventing a new abbreviated name. This keeps the code readable and avoids cryptic
short names like `aw`, `aw_ref`, or `raw`.

Good:

```rust
let awaiter = unsafe { awaiter.get_unchecked_mut() };
let awaiter = ptr::from_mut(awaiter);
let awaiter = unsafe { &*awaiter };
```

Bad:

```rust
let aw = unsafe { awaiter.get_unchecked_mut() };
let raw = ptr::from_mut(aw);
let aw_ref = unsafe { &*raw };
```

Only use a different name when both forms are needed simultaneously in the same scope.

# Language

Use proper English grammar, spelling and punctuation.

Titles are normal sentences, do not capitalize every word in a title.

Sentences end with punctuation:

* This is wrong: "//! // Create a pool for storing u64 values"
* This is correct: "//! Create a pool for storing u64 values."

Comments are regular sentences and END WITH A PERIOD or other punctuation.

Do not forget proper language in tests, doctests and examples.

Do not use contractions, that is not professional English. Use "do not" instead of "don't", etc.

# Use of unwrap() and expect()

Use `unwrap()` in test code and only in test code. Do not use `expect()` in test code.

You may use `expect()` in non-test code but only if there is a reason to believe that the expectation
will never fail. That is, we do not use `expect()` as an assertion, we use it to cut off unreachable
code paths. The message inside `expect()` should explain why we can be certain that code path is
unreachable - it is not an error message saying what went wrong!

State clearly in the `expect()` message why the expectation is guaranteed to hold. Do not use words
like "should" - if it only "should" hold, then you have failed to establish a guarantee!

Using `assert!()` or other panic-inducing macros in non-test code is fine as long as it is documented
in API documentation (in a `# Panics` section). Treat the `assert!()` message the same as the
message for `expect!()` - it should justify why we expect the assertion to hold. If we do not
expect the assertion to hold but are merely fulfilling an API contract to panic, no assert message
is to be used. Similarly, do not use assertion messages in tests.

# Safety comments

Safety comments must explain how we satisfy the safety requirements of the unsafe function we are
calling. The API documentation of an unsafe function has a "Safety" section that poses a challenge
and the safety comment is the response - the two must be paired and correspond to each other.

Safety comments are not there just to re-state the requirements or make generic claims, they must
specifically explain how we satisfy the safety requirements of the function we are calling (e.g.
by referencing an assertion, a type invariant, earlier logic or other mechanism).

When creating a reference from a raw pointer (`unsafe { &*ptr }`, `unsafe { &mut *ptr }`,
`NonNull::as_ref`, `NonNull::as_mut`, etc.), the safety comment must address BOTH:

1. **Validity** — the pointer is non-null, properly aligned, points to an initialized value of
   the correct type, and the pointee outlives the new reference.
2. **Aliasing** — explain why no conflicting reference exists for the duration of the new borrow:
   - For `&T`: no `&mut T` to the same memory may exist concurrently.
   - For `&mut T`: no other `&T` or `&mut T` to the same memory may exist concurrently. This
     includes references on other threads.

Documenting only validity is insufficient. Rust's aliasing rules are equally strict and equally
easy to violate, especially when constructing references from raw pointers stored across function
calls or threads. Justify aliasing by referencing locks held, single-threaded ownership,
`!Send`/`!Sync` markers, scope-bounded borrows, atomic-only access, or other concrete mechanisms.

Safety comments are also required in examples and doctests that use `unsafe` blocks.

Safety comments (whether single- or multiline) go above the line with the `unsafe` block. To be
clear, they are associated with a specific `unsafe` block, not with a function call. Example:

```rust
/// SAFETY: We ensured above that the pointer is valid and aligned for the type `T`.
unsafe {
    unsafe_function(pointer);
}
```

Each `unsafe` block is expected to only have one call to an unsafe function, and should not have 
nontrivial safe code inside it.

Good example - only unsafe code in the unsafe block:

```rust
/// SAFETY: We ensured above that the pointer is valid and aligned for the type `T`.
let entity = Entity::from(unsafe {
    unsafe_function(pointer)
});
```

Bad example - `unsafe` block includes safe code:

```rust
/// SAFETY: We ensured above that the pointer is valid and aligned for the type `T`.
let entity = unsafe {
    Entity::from(unsafe_function(pointer))
};
```

# Reentrancy through callbacks

User-supplied callbacks (`Waker::wake`, `Drop` impls, observer closures, etc.) can
re-enter the data structure they were invoked from and silently corrupt invariants
without violating any borrow-checker, type-system, or Miri rule. Never invoke a user
callback while holding a borrow or lock on shared state, never `mem::take`/`swap`/
`replace` shared state when the callback could re-enter through the original location,
and document the reentrancy contract (with parity tests across thread-safe and
single-threaded variants) on every public async primitive. See
[docs/callback-safety.md](docs/callback-safety.md) for the full rationale, anti-patterns,
and examples.

# Whitespace

There should be an empty line between functions.

# Non-zero integers

Whenever a numeric value must be non-zero, prefer `NonZero<usize>` over `usize`,
in both private APIs/logic and public APIs. Prefer `NonZero<usize>` over `NonZeroUsize`.

# File contents flow

Bigger and more important types go higher in the file, smaller and less important types go lower.

Public API types go higher in the file, private types go lower.

The implementation of a type should stay close to the definition of the type (e.g. `impl` blocks
of a type follow the `struct` block).

# Visibility

Types, fields, functions and methods should have the minimum required visibility, only being
visible in the same file by default if not part of the public API surface.

Use `pub(crate)` only when a type actually needs to be accessible in other files of the same crate.

# Diagrams

Mermaid diagrams are encouraged in API documentation where they make sense.

Each diagram should be a separate file in a `crate/docs/diagrams` folder, with the file
extension `.mermaid`. The file name should match the diagram name used in the documentation.

Rendering Mermaid diagrams in Rust API documentation requires the `simple-mermaid` package to
be referenced. The syntax for embedding a Mermaid diagram is
`#![doc = mermaid!("../doc/region_cached.mermaid")]`. See existing examples for a detailed
reference (e.g. the `region_local` package).

# Comments must add value not re-state the code

Comments that merely restate the obvious are not desired. Comments should add value by explaining
why something is done, what it accomplishes, or how it works. Avoid comments that simply repeat
what the code does.

Do not use section separator comments (e.g. `// --- Section ---` or `// ======= Title =======`)
to create visual "chapters" in code. Code organization should be clear from naming and structure.

Bad comment:

```rust
/// Unique identifier for this pool instance.
pool_id: u64,
```

Good comment:

```rust
/// We need to uniquely identify each pool to ensure that memory is not returned to the
/// wrong pool. If the pool ID does not match when returning memory, we panic.
pool_id: u64,
```

# Testing for panics and errors

It is good to create tests that verify expected panics/errors are returned. However, never
check for a specific error/panic message - these are not part of the public API and create
fragile tests. Just verify that an error of an expected type occurs or any panic occurs.

For tests that must verify a panic but also continue running afterwards (e.g. to check that
a data structure is still in a valid state), use `testing::assert_panics(|| ...)` instead of
hand-rolling `catch_unwind(AssertUnwindSafe(...))`. When a canary substring check is warranted,
use `testing::assert_panics_with(|| ..., |message| assert!(message.contains("canary")))`.

# Keep the house in order

Do not only focus on the immediate task at hand but also consider how it affects the codebase
around it.

If the change you are working on affords more simplicity, better organization or greater reuse,
take action to perform the refactoring needed to achieve that. If the change you are working on
makes some logic or tests obsolete, clean up.

Code should be well covered with unit tests, public APIs should be documented and include inline
examples. The most important scenarios should be covered by stand-alone example binaries.

Performance-critical code should include Criterion benchmarks to help detect regressions.

# Document the contract, not the implementation

API documentation on types and functions should describe the API contract (i.e. the inputs,
the outputs and the behavior) not how it is implemented. Do not discuss implementation details
like private helper types or reference the internal field structure of a type in API documentation.

Specific things that are implementation details and do NOT belong in API documentation:

* Internal data structures (e.g. "uses an intrusive linked list").
* Internal ordering guarantees (e.g. "FIFO") unless they are part of the API contract.
* What fields a node or struct contains internally.
* Whether a future is `Unpin` or not (obvious from the type's auto-trait inference).

# Keep API documentation summary lines short

The first line of each `///` doc comment is used as the summary in rustdoc type and method tables.
Keep this first line short and concise so it does not wrap to the next line in the generated
documentation. Move detailed descriptions to subsequent paragraphs after a blank `///` line.

# Lint suppressions

It is fine to suppress Clippy and compiler lints in the code if it is justified. All suppressions
must have a `reason` field to justify them.

Prefer `expect` over `allow` suppressions, except when applying a broadly-scoped suppression that
applies to a whole file or module using inner attributes, in which case "allow" is preferred.

# Panic in drop()

It is OK to verify that type invariants still hold in `drop()` and panic if some have been violated,
e.g. when an item is not in a valid state to be dropped. However, all such assertions must be
guarded with a `thread::panicking()` check to ensure that the panic does not occur when already
unwinding for another panic - we do not want to double-panic as that mangles the errors.

# Benchmark design

Unless otherwise prompted, create single-threaded synchronous Criterion benchmarks. Use benchmark
groups to group related benchmarks that make sense to compare to each other.

Focus on benchmarking elementary operations, do not create benchmarks with lots of long-winded
logic. We generally want to benchmark a single API call or at most a sequence of closely coupled
API calls.

Only the functionality being benchmarked should be inside the `.iter()` closure, with the data setup
being either done outside (if not per-iteration) or using the first "payload preparation" callback
of `iter_batched()` (if per-iteration).

If multithreaded benchmarks are truly appropriate, use `bench_on_threadpool()` for them. When using
this for multithreaded benchmarks, also run any single-threaded benchmarks
via `bench_on_threadpool()` to ensure that overheads are comparable.

Inside the benchmark closure, use `std::hint::black_box()` to consume output values from the code
being benchmarked, to avoid unrealistic eager optimizations due to output values that are discarded.

Benchmarks that are meant to be compared to each other must be in the same benchmark function
and in the same benchmark group.

Do not use `Box::pin(value)` on the measured path. It allocates a `Box` on the heap on every
iteration, which can easily add 100-200 instructions (or 40-50% of the measurement) of pure
allocator overhead that has nothing to do with the operation under test. Use
`std::pin::pin!(value)` instead — it pins on the stack with zero allocation. Add a brief inline
comment justifying the deviation from the usual `Box::pin` preference (e.g. "stack-pin to avoid
allocator noise on the measured path"). This is an exception to the workspace-wide rule against
the `pin!` macro.

`Box::pin` remains correct in benchmark code that is NOT inside the measured region:

* Criterion `iter_custom` setup (anything before `Instant::now()`).
* The first ("payload preparation") callback of `iter_batched()`.
* Gungraun setup functions referenced via `#[bench::id(setup_fn())]` — these run outside the
  measured region and pass the result into the bench body by value.
* Helper functions that must return `Pin<Box<T>>` across a function boundary (a stack pin would
  dangle).
* Intentional `Box::pin` baselines where the allocation IS what is being measured.

Do not forget to register benchmarks in `Cargo.toml`.

# Callgrind benchmarks

For performance-critical hot paths, complement the Criterion benchmarks with Callgrind-based
instruction-count benchmarks driven by Valgrind. These live alongside the Criterion benches in
the same `packages/<pkg>/benches/` directory, with the file-suffix convention `_cg.rs` (short
for Callgrind, to be honest about the fact that the numbers come from a simulated
microarchitecture rather than the real CPU).

The pairing is **asymmetric**: every Callgrind scenario must have an analogous Criterion
scenario (so we have both wall-clock and instruction-count signals on the same operation). The
reverse is not required — Criterion can legitimately stand alone for multithreaded contention,
syscalls, allocation, or bulk throughput where instruction-count resolution adds no signal.

See [docs/callgrind-benchmarks.md](docs/callgrind-benchmarks.md) for the full strategy,
including: which operations warrant Callgrind coverage, scenario selection guidelines
(default case, branching extremes, state/occupancy variants, size sensitivity, initialization
vs steady state, sibling variants), the bench file template (including the file-scope lint
suppression block required by Gungraun's macro expansions), Cargo.toml setup with the
target-gated dependency, Gungraun syntax gotchas, the pairing convention, how to interpret
results, and why design decisions motivated by a Callgrind delta should always be
cross-validated against the Criterion counterpart (real CPUs can absorb or amplify a
simulated cost by orders of magnitude).

# `#[inline]` annotations

`#[inline]` is a hint to the compiler to consider inlining a function. Throughout this
section, "generic" includes any function that needs monomorphization — a function counts
as generic if it takes type parameters of its own or if it is defined in a generic type
or `impl`, even when the function itself takes no type parameters.

Apply the first matching rule:

1. **Apply `#[inline]` to non-generic functions exported from the crate that sit on a hot
   path** based on your knowledge of how the API is used. Act on this knowledge alone,
   accepting some documentation noise — without the annotation the compiler has no
   opportunity to inline the function into downstream consumers, and we want to give it
   that opportunity even if no current benchmark measurably benefits (a future workload
   or customer case might).

2. **Otherwise, only apply `#[inline]` if benchmarks or disassembly show a generic or
   same-crate function on a hot path is not being inlined.** These are already inlining
   candidates by default, so the annotation is an extra hint applied only when measurement
   shows the default decision is wrong. Verify with `just package=<pkg> bench-cg` before
   and after, comparing instruction counts; revert if the numbers do not move.

3. **Do not use `#[inline(always)]` or `#[inline(never)]` without specific
   justification.** These are stronger hints intended as advanced tuning knobs;
   general-purpose code should not reach for them.

# YAML formatting

Prefer not using quotes around strings, unless the string starts with special characters.

Example of desired formatting:

```yaml
regular_field: just some text
special_field: ':::starts with special characters, needs quoting'
```

# Use imports and do not reference types via absolute paths

Types we reference should be imported via `use` statements. Unless there is a specific need
to disambiguate between similarly named types, do not use absolute paths to types.

This is good:

```rust
use std::time::Instant;

fn foo(i: Instant) {}
```

This is bad:

```rust
fn foo(i: std::time::Instant) { }
```

Referencing types in `std` via absolute paths for no reason is especially sinful.

It is fine to rely on the Rust prelude - no need to explicitly import types from the Rust prelude.

`use` statements go at the top of the file or module, not inside functions.

Do not `use super::` except in unit tests. Instead, use the full path `use crate::` style.

Prefer importing types at the highest level they are visible. For example, if a type is defined
in `src/session.rs` but also re-exported at the crate root, you should import it from the crate
root.

Wrong:

```rust
use crate::session::AllocationTrackingSession;
```

Correct:

```rust
use crate::AllocationTrackingSession;
```

Exceptions:

* Refer to `std::alloc::System` by full path because the short form of this causes AI hallucinations.

# Dependencies in cargo.toml

Dependencies are sorted alphabetically by name of the package.

# Default features

Do not define default features in `Cargo.toml` unless there is a specific, justified reason
to do so. Features should be opt-in, not opt-out.

# Feature-gated documentation

Use `#![cfg_attr(docsrs, feature(doc_cfg))]` at the crate root. The `doc_cfg` feature
now includes automatic inference of feature gates from `#[cfg(feature = "...")]` attributes,
so per-item `#[cfg_attr(docsrs, doc(cfg(...)))]` annotations are not needed.

Do not use `doc_auto_cfg` — it has been removed and merged into `doc_cfg`.

Ensure `Cargo.toml` contains:

```toml
[package.metadata.docs.rs]
all-features = true
```

Intra-doc links from ungated documentation to feature-gated items (modules, types, trait
`impl`s that only exist under a non-default feature) break when docs are built without that
feature. Never drop the link or paste a raw URL to dodge the warning — use the
feature-conditional `#[cfg_attr(..., doc = "...")]` doc-line pattern instead. See
[docs/api-docs.md](docs/api-docs.md) for the full rationale, anti-patterns, and examples. The
`docs-default-features` validation step exists to catch this class of error.

# Do not use `\n` in println!() statements

To empty an empty line to the terminal, use use `println!();` instead of
embedding `\n` in another printed line.

# Delays are forbidden in test code

There should never be any delay/sleep on the successful path in tests - every test must be
near-instantaneous and time-based synchronization is forbidden.

To be clear, any form of "sleep" or "delay" that uses a real-time clock is forbidden in test code.
If the type can be made to use a `tick::Clock` then a clock using a simulated time source may be
used in test code (via `tick::ClockControl`).

You may use events/signals for synchronization (e.g. `Barrier` or `events_once` events or message channels),
as long as there are no delays or wait-loops in the test code itself.

# Flaky test discoveries are recorded as issues

If you stumble across a flaky test while working on something unrelated (for example a
CI failure that is not caused by your change, or a doctest that violates the "no delays"
rule above), file a GitHub issue so the discovery is not lost. Use `gh issue create` with
a clear title and a body that includes:

- the path and line range of the offending test,
- the failure mode (which assertion / message / scenario triggers it),
- a link to the run or PR where you noticed it,
- a suggested fix if one is obvious.

We do this for any flake — not just timing-related ones (e.g. order-sensitive,
environment-sensitive, machine-load-sensitive). Recording these accidental discoveries
lets us batch the cleanup later instead of losing the lead. Do not silently fix the
flake as part of an unrelated change — the issue lets us track and prioritise it
independently.

# Tests must not hang

When there is a danger that a test may hang (e.g. it contains a `.wait()`, `.recv()` or
similar call), you must use `testing::with_watchdog(|| { ... })` to wrap the test body with
a timeout. Do not implement custom watchdog timers — always use the existing watchdog from
the `testing` package.

Watchdogs are automatically disabled during mutation testing (`MUTATION_TESTING=1` environment
variable). A mutation that causes a test to hang should be fixed by either redesigning the test
to catch the mutation without blocking (e.g. adding `debug_assert!` checks) or by skipping the
mutation if it is impractical to catch.

# Threshold-based mutation protections are an anti-pattern

When a mutation could make a test hang (for example, a mutation that turns an iterator's
`next()` into an infinite source), it is tempting to add a `.take(N)` "safety bound" or a
similar magic constant that caps consumption so the test cannot hang. Do not do this.
Such thresholds are fragile in the same way time-based delays are fragile: they are easy
to miss when tests evolve, and there is no principled way to verify that the chosen value
is the "right" threshold for every future test scenario. The anti-pattern applies even
when the threshold is numeric rather than time-based.

Legitimate alternatives, in order of preference:

1. **Meaningful-iteration assertion.** Rewrite the test so it asserts on the actual
   produced values rather than just consuming them. Tools that naturally bound consumption
   while verifying values are ideal — for example, `Iterator::eq(expected_array)` calls
   `self.next()` at most `expected.len() + 1` times, returns `false` on the first value
   mismatch, and detects both wrong values and wrong length. A correct implementation
   matches the expected array; a mutation that yields wrong values or runs forever
   short-circuits on the first comparison. The bound is implicit in the scenario data
   (the expected length), not a hand-tuned safety margin.

2. **Skip the mutation** with `#[cfg_attr(test, mutants::skip)]` and a comment explaining
   why catching it is impractical (see the "Mutation testing coverage and skipping
   mutations" section below for the criteria).

# Named constants

Avoid magic values in the code and use named constants instead. It does not matter how many
times the magic value is present, even one instance is enough to warrant a named constant.

This includes zero. `0` is just as much a magic value as `1` or `42` when it represents a
domain concept (e.g. an initial state, a sentinel index, an empty bitfield, the absence of
flags). Define a named constant (`IDLE`, `EMPTY`, `NONE`, `ROOT`, etc.) and use it instead.
Numeric `0` only stays unadorned when it is literally arithmetic (e.g. `for i in 0..n`,
`x.saturating_sub(0)`, `Vec::with_capacity(0)`).

If constants are only used in one function, put them at the top of that function.

The exception is example code - if a magic value is only used once in an example, it is
fine to leave it inline.

# Design documentation

Document design elements, key decisions and architectural choices in inline comments in the
files to which they apply. Use regular `//` comments, not API documentation comments.

# Justify deviations from standard patterns

When you reach for a hand-rolled construct or non-standard pattern in place of the obvious
ecosystem default — for example, `hashbrown::HashTable` instead of `std::collections::HashMap`,
a custom intrusive container instead of `Vec`/`VecDeque`, a bespoke synchronization primitive
instead of `std::sync`, manual `Pin`/`UnsafeCell` plumbing instead of safe wrappers, an internal
trait re-implementation instead of using a library trait — you must explain *why* in a comment
next to the deviation.

The justification should cover:

* What standard pattern the reader would expect to see here and is not seeing.
* Which alternatives were considered and ruled out, with the concrete reason each was rejected
  (e.g. "unstable on Rust 1.95", "fails NLL borrow-check", "trait bound `X: Y` does not hold for
  our key type", "allocates per call").
* What the chosen variant buys us that the standard pattern does not.

Without this, the next reader will reasonably assume the deviation is accidental or unnecessary
and try to "fix" it back to the standard pattern. The comment is what prevents that wasted cycle.

# Performance optimization principles

When proposing or applying performance optimizations:

* **Optimizations must be motivated by user-facing scenarios, not raw benchmark deltas.**
  A Callgrind win on a synthetic micro-benchmark is not by itself sufficient justification. Ask:
  *what real workload does this help, and is that workload a design target of this package?* If
  the answer is "I would have to invent one", the change should usually not land.
* **Prefer surgical interventions over architectural rewrites.** A 5-line `#[inline]`, a
  single-field type change (`fn` → `Option<fn>`), or an `unreachable!()` → `unreachable_unchecked!()`
  swap is the right shape of optimization PR when measurement points at a specific instruction
  the compiler is emitting. Multi-file restructurings (changing in-memory representation,
  monomorphizing on type traits, deferring initialization, swapping data structures) are an
  order of magnitude harder to land and need correspondingly stronger motivation.
* **Preserve defensive runtime checks even if they cost a handful of instructions.** A runtime
  `unreachable!()`, `debug_assert!`, or `Option::expect` arm is often there to surface
  thread-safety bugs, state-machine corruption, or other "this should never happen but if it
  does we want to know" conditions. Do not remove these to save a `cmpq` — if you have a
  measured need to remove the check, prefer the surgical alternative (`unreachable_unchecked!`,
  `debug_assert!` instead of `assert!`, etc.) that keeps the contract documented.
* **Stay idiomatic Rust.** Manually controlling memory representation (`repr(C)` for layout
  stability, `alloc_zeroed` on hand-crafted layouts, explicit discriminant encoding) leans
  toward "coding Rust as if it were C" and is rarely worth the resulting reader confusion
  and soundness review burden. Trust the compiler's layout decisions unless there is a
  concrete cross-language interop or ABI requirement that forces your hand.
* **First-insert and teardown costs are usually not worth optimizing.** Most data structures
  in this workspace target long-lived, steady-state workloads. Optimizations whose entire
  value is in the construction or destruction path (first allocation, bulk drop, etc.)
  rarely pay for the complexity they introduce.

When filing a performance issue, state explicitly which of these criteria the proposal meets.
If you have to invent a scenario to motivate it, the issue should probably not be filed.

Some packages have package-scoped optimization guidance that refines these principles for
their domain (e.g. `packages/events_once/AGENTS.md` codifies the relative priority of pooled,
embedded and boxed events, and the expectation that `LocalEvent` beats `Event`). Always check
for a package-local `AGENTS.md` when planning optimization work in a specific crate.

# Hide async entrypoint in examples

In inline code examples that use `.await`, do not render the async
entrypoint/wrapper in generated API documentation.

Example:

```rust
use events::once::Event;
# use futures::executor::block_on;

# block_on(async {
let event = get_event();
let message = event.await;

assert_eq!(message, "Hello, World!");
# });
```

# Re-export defaults to wildcard

We prefer to re-export public types from private modules
using a wildcard import. There is no need to name the types separately.

Good:

```rust
pub use events::*;
```

Bad:

```rust
pub use events::{Event, LocalEvent, EventPool, LocalEventPool};
```

# Prefer pub(crate) over pub(other)

We do not use `pub(super)` and other fine-grained visibility modifiers. A type is either private
to a module, public, or public within the whole crate.

# Checked arithmetic

Unless there is a specific reason to use saturating/wrapping arithmetic, use checked arithmetic
(`.checked_add()` and similar) and handle the error case. Do not use regular unchecked arithmetic
(`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`) as it can overflow and panic.

It is fine to `.expect()` success if there is some reason to believe overflow can never happen,
e.g. because it is guarded by an assertion or because it would require some data structure to
exceed the size of virtual memory. If very confident that an overflow can never occur, it is
fine to use wrapping arithmetic via explicit `.wrapping_add()` methods.

This only applies to non-test code - in tests and benchmarks, it is fine to use whatever arithmetic
is most convenient.

# Examples show good practices

Examples are production code. Use proper patterns and practices - examples are not tests, where
looser rules can be allowed.

# Inline examples separate scenarios into separate code blocks

If you create inline (doctest) examples that showcase multiple scenarios/variations, separate each
variant into its own code block with a short individual description instead of showing examples of
multiple scenarios in one code block.

# Stand-alone examples separate scenarios into functions

If you create stand-alone example files that showcase multiple scenarios/variations, separate each
variant into its own function instead of having everything in a giant `main()` function.

# Replacing text in code files

Prefer applying diffs over generating regex-replace commands for the terminal.

# Avoid the `pin!` macro in tests and examples

This macro is special-purpose and not intended for general use. Instead, use
`Box::pin(value)` to pin a value in examples.

If there is some reason `Box::pin(value)` would not work, you can use `std::pin::pin!(value)`
as a last resort but leave a comment to justify why this is the case.

Benchmarks are an exception: on the measured path, use `std::pin::pin!` to avoid allocator
overhead distorting the measurement. See the "Benchmark design" section for details.

# Multiple statements per command

You can execute multiple statements per command in the terminal, separated by semicolons. Do not
waste time executing one command at a time when you can execute multiple commands in one go.

```powershell
mv src/old.rs src/new.rs; cargo fmt; cargo clippy --fix --allow-dirty --allow-staged; cargo test
```

# Examples for README.md files

In each package with a `README.md` file, there should be a corresponding
`examples/package_name_readme.rs` file that contains the Rust code present in the example.
This is important to verify that the example actually works.

If the two are out of sync, use the `package_name_readme.rs` as the authoritative source
and update the `README.md` file to match it.

It is fine to disable Clippy rules in the `package_name_readme.rs` file, as it
is not production code and often needs to take shortcuts to be short and simple.

# Memory allocation is the root of all evil

Avoid algorithms that allocate memory at runtime when an allocation-free alternative is available.

# Miri and platform compatibility

Tests that talk to the real operating system generally fail to execute under Miri. This is fine and
expected. However, a Miri test run must still succeed with a clean result! If there are tests that
cannot be executed under Miri, they should be excluded via `#[cfg_attr(miri, ignore))]` (plus a comment
justifying why it is correct to exclude them).

Naturally, if it is possible to redesign a test so it does not rely on the operating system, that
is even better. However, this is not always possible.

Miri is too slow when running tests with large data sets (anything with 100s or 1000s of items).
Exclude such tests from running under Miri.

Doctests are not executed under Miri. There is no need to make doctests Miri-compatible.

# Testing atomic operations and custom synchronization

Any code that uses atomic operations, custom wakers, or other synchronization primitives must
include tests that exercise real multithreaded scenarios (e.g. signaling completion from another
thread via `events_once::Event`). These tests should be Miri-compatible (no OS-specific calls)
and verified via `just package=<name> miri-harder`, which runs Miri with many random seeds
(`-Zmiri-many-seeds=..64`). The combination of true multithreaded tests and miri-harder is
highly effective at detecting data races, incorrect memory orderings, and other concurrency bugs
that are nearly impossible to catch with single-threaded tests alone.

# parking_lot is forbidden — use std::sync primitives

Do not use `parking_lot::Mutex`, `parking_lot::RwLock`, or other primitives from the `parking_lot`
crate. They rely on OS-specific syscalls that Miri cannot model, so introducing them breaks our
Miri-based correctness validation. Use `std::sync::Mutex`, `std::sync::RwLock`, and other
std-provided synchronization primitives instead — these are Miri-compatible.

This rule applies even when `parking_lot` would offer a measurable performance benefit: Miri
coverage is more valuable than the fast-path savings.

# Mutation testing coverage and skipping mutations

We expect all mutations to either be unviable or to be caught. Uncaught mutations and mutants that
time out are anomalies that must be corrected.

It is acceptable to skip mutations if they are impractical to test. Some justifiable reasons are:

* Detecting the mutation requires real timing logic to be used. We intentionally do not permit any
  timing-dependent code in our test cases. However, if circumstances allow, we can use the `tick`
  crate with its simulated clock to create timing-dependent logic that can be tested without real
  time passing.
* Detecting the mutation requires detecting that a thing is not happening (e.g. detecting that an object
  is never dropped or that some code never executes). This can sometimes be impossible without relying
  on real-time timeouts (which would violate the above expectation).
* The mutation is in a defensive branch for defense in depth and can never be reached due to higher layers
  of the API preventing the situation from arising.
* The mutation is in trivial forwarder code (e.g. a facade that chooses between a real and mock implementation).

To skip a mutation, use the `#[cfg_attr(test, mutants::skip)]` style and leave a comment to justify
why we are skipping it.

Before skipping a mutation, consider how to catch it. Beyond simply improving test coverage, the
following techniques may help:

* Adding `debug_assert!()` statements to strategic places, verifying that logical invariants still hold.

# Adjust patterns, fix entire classes of problems

If you are asked to do a thing to one instance of a problem in a file, check for other instances.
You must solve the entire class of problems at once, not expect each instance to be pointed
out to you in instructions.

# Documentation is about today, not about yesterday

Both inline and API documentation must describe the current facts, not history from previous
designs or iterations. Do not make comparisons with mechanisms that no longer exist in the API.

# Test-only code requires cfg(test)

If there are functions that are only used in tests, mark them (and their `use` statements)
with `#[cfg(test)]`. Do not just suppress "dead code" warnings.

# Feature-gated code should also be enabled by `test` build

If code is feature-gated, it should always also be enabled in test builds:
`#[cfg(any(test, feature = "foo"))]`

When a feature gate controls a dependency (e.g. `dep:futures-core` behind `futures-stream`),
ensure the dependency is also listed as a dev-dependency so it is available in test builds
without requiring the feature to be explicitly activated.

# There are many files in the workspace

Avoid running large "process all files" commands directly in the workspace root. Use at least
one level of subdirectory.

# Dev-dependencies within workspace packages must be path dependencies

Do not use `version = "1.2.3"` or `workspace = true` when adding a package from the same workspace as a dev-dependency. Within the same workspace, dev-dependencies must always be `path = "../foo"` style path-references.

# Test presence of traits via static assertions

Use `static_assertions::assert_impl_all!` and `static_assertions::assert_not_impl_any!` to check
for the presence or absence of traits where the API documentation makes claims about them,
for example in terms of being thread-mobile (Send + !Sync), thread-safe (Send + Sync)
or single-threaded (neither).

If generic type parameters are involved, these assertions should use some arbitrarily selected typical
types that may be encountered in user code.

# Unwind safety

All public API types must implement `UnwindSafe` and `RefUnwindSafe` so they can be passed
through `catch_unwind()` boundaries. Verify this with static assertions:

```rust
static_assertions::assert_impl_all!(MyType: UnwindSafe, RefUnwindSafe);
```

If a type cannot reasonably be made unwind-safe (e.g. it wraps a lock guard), pin the negative
contract with `assert_not_impl_any!` and a comment explaining why.

**Exception: types that guard user data** (e.g. mutex guards, lock types wrapping `UnsafeCell<T>`)
should NOT implement `UnwindSafe` or `RefUnwindSafe`. User code can panic while holding the lock,
leaving the guarded data in an inconsistent state. Let the compiler's auto-trait inference
correctly mark these types as `!UnwindSafe`. Do not add manual `impl UnwindSafe` for such types.

When a `!Sync` marker is needed, use `PhantomData<Cell<()>>`. The `Cell<()>` type is natively
`Send + !Sync`, so no `unsafe impl Send` is required. Since `Cell` wraps `UnsafeCell` which is
`!RefUnwindSafe`, a manual `impl RefUnwindSafe` is needed on the containing type. This is sound
only if all other fields are also ref-unwind-safe — verify this before adding the impl. Do not
use `PhantomData<*mut ()>` with `unsafe impl Send` — while this achieves the same `!Sync` effect,
it triggers a rustc bug where async generator auto-trait inference cannot prove `Send` when the
type parameter is a trait object (`dyn Trait`).

More broadly, never put a `'static` bound on an `unsafe impl Send` or `unsafe impl Sync`. If
the struct definition already requires `T: 'static`, the bound is redundant on the impl and
repeating it triggers the same rustc bug (rust-lang/rust#110338). The higher-ranked region
solver fails to prove `'static` when the type parameter is a trait object. Since the struct
bound already enforces `'static` at construction time, omitting it from the impl is safe.

When auto-derivation fails due to interior mutability types like `UnsafeCell`, `RefCell`, or
`NonNull<UnsafeCell<...>>`, add manual `impl UnwindSafe`/`impl RefUnwindSafe` with a comment
justifying why the type's invariants prevent observing inconsistent state during unwind.

Error types generated by `#[ohno::error]` contain an `OhnoCore` field with
`Arc<dyn Error + Send + Sync>`, which is `!UnwindSafe` because `Arc<T>` requires
`T: RefUnwindSafe` and trait objects are `!RefUnwindSafe`. As long as the error type does not
expose any mutation methods, add `impl UnwindSafe` and `impl RefUnwindSafe` for it. If a
mutation method is later added, the manual impl must be re-evaluated.

# Macros may need public-private visibility

For purpose of accessing members of types or modules from published macros, it is permissible to
make logically private items public. This must be accompanied by two adjustments:

* The item must be marked with `#[doc(hidden)]` to prevent it from being included in the
  public API documentation. This is our signal that it is not an officially supported public API.
* The path to the item must include the keyword "private". The preferred forms are:
  - For types, use a `private` module, e.g. `foo::private::Bar`.
  - For methods, use a `__private_` prefix, e.g. `Bar::__private_reset_counters()`.

# UI tests

UI tests all go in a workspace-scoped `ui_tests` package due to technical limitations. Follow
inline documentation in this package to understand more.

Package dependencies of UI tests must be excluded from `udeps` scanner logic via `Cargo.toml` in
`ui_tests`. See existing examples in this file.

# Do not check for specific panic or error messages

Tests that use `#[should_panic]` or use `Display` output of error types must not check for specific
panic or error messages - these messages are not an API contract and may change at any time.

Exceptions where checking for a specific message is acceptable:

* **Canary substrings**: checking that a panic message contains a stable keyword (e.g.
  `#[should_panic(expected = "overflow")]`) when the keyword is inherent to the scenario and
  unlikely to be removed by refactoring.
* **Pass-through verification**: checking the exact panic message when the test verifies that a
  panic is forwarded without tampering (e.g. through `catch_unwind` + `resume_unwind`).

This only pertains to error messages - non-error outputs of `Display` should still be tested.

# Type names

Do not hardcode type names in string literals. Instead use `type_name::<Self>()` or similar.

# PowerShell scripts in justfiles must consider exit codes

Every PowerShell script in a .just file (i.e. every `[script]` block) must start with the following:

```powershell
$ErrorActionPreference = "Stop"
$PSNativeCommandUseErrorActionPreference = $true
```

This ensures that commands that produce nonzero exit codes are correctly considered errors and fail the script.

# Test coverage

In some circumstances, we may need to mark parts of code as intentionally not covered by tests. For example:

* Tests themselves - the tooling measures test code as well as real code. We only care about real code, so all
  unit test modules and mock/fake test utilities (anything `#[cfg(test)]`) need to be excluded. Integration tests
  in `tests/` are automatically excluded, though - no need to worry about those.
* Defensive branches that can never be reached due to defense in depth layering.
* Code that is only ever executed on a const context, as const context is not covered in coverage measurements.
* When code has no API contract to test (e.g. `fmt::Debug` implementations which may contractually write anything).
* Facade types whose only purpose is to redirect calls to either a real or mock implementation - not worth testing.

To exclude code from coverage measurement, mark it with `#[cfg_attr(coverage_nightly, coverage(off))]`. This
also requires `#![cfg_attr(coverage_nightly, feature(coverage_attribute))]` on the crate level.

Note that `coverage(off)` applies to entire functions, not to individual branches. Defensive branches inside
a function (e.g. `debug_assert!(false)` for structurally unreachable states) cannot be excluded from coverage
measurement. Accept these as known gaps rather than trying to restructure the code to work around them.

When excluding code for any other reason than "it is test code", leave a comment to explain why.

# Keep names simple and unadorned

Avoid unnecessary and repetitive prefixes and suffixes.

For example:

* Builder methods are just a noun. It is `FooBuilder::bar(value)` not `FooBuilder::with_bar(value)`.

# Memory allocation is the root of all evil

Avoid algorithms that allocate memory at runtime when an allocation-free alternative is available.

# Creating GitHub pull requests

When creating PRs with `gh pr create`, do not pass the `--body` flag with an inline string because
PowerShell mangles backticks and special characters. Instead, write the PR body to a temporary file
and use `--body-file path/to/file.md`.

# Addressing pull request review comments

When addressing PR review comments, reply to each comment thread with the disposition (what you
did to address it) and mark the thread as resolved after pushing the commit that addresses it.

# Version bumps

Do not bump crate versions in feature branches. Version bumps are handled by the release process.
