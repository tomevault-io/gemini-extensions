# Orchestrator - Claude Code Context

⚠️ **SETUP REQUIRED** - Run `/setup-orchestrator` to configure this for your organization.

**Last Updated: [DATE - will be updated by setup wizard]**

---

## Repository Overview

**What is this repo?** The Orchestrator is a **central infrastructure repository** that provides shared Claude Code resources (agents, skills, hooks, commands) to all projects via symlinks.

**Purpose:** Single source of truth for:
- Generic AI agents (code review, planning, documentation, refactoring)
- Auto-triggering skills (organization-specific development patterns)
- Hooks (skill activation, file tracking)
- Slash commands (dev docs creation)
- Shared guidelines (architecture, error handling, testing)

**Key Difference from Application Repos:**
- **orchestrator** (this repo): Shared infrastructure provider
- **your repositories**: **[Will be listed here after setup - e.g., app repo, core repo, etc.]**

**Critical:** Changes here affect ALL repos via symlinks. Test in application repos before committing.

#### cross-repo-doc-sync (Orchestrator-Only)
**When to use:** Synchronize orchestrator documentation with changes in **[your repositories]**

**Availability:** Must be invoked from the orchestrator repository

**Important:** While the agent file is accessible from all repos via symlinks, the agent includes runtime checks and will refuse to operate if not invoked from the orchestrator directory. This is because it requires:
- Write access to orchestrator documentation
- Read access to all application repositories
- Correct working directory for relative paths

**How to invoke:**
- Task tool with subagent_type: "cross-repo-doc-sync"
- Prompt: "Sync orchestrator docs based on recent changes in **[your repos]**"

- Validates cross-references and code examples
- Provides sync reports and cost metrics

**Two-phase workflow:**
1. **SYNC MODE**: Agent analyzes repos and updates docs (saves estimated metrics)
2. **UPDATE MODE**: Update metrics with actual token usage from UI
   - Re-invoke with: `"Update metrics with actual: [TOKENS] tokens, [SECONDS] seconds"`

**Cross-repo access:**
- Reads from **[paths to your repos - configured during setup]**
- Only writes to orchestrator documentation

**Metrics tracking:**
- Saves metrics to `doc-sync-logs/metrics/sync-costs.jsonl`
- Generates sync reports in `doc-sync-logs/sync-reports/`
- View dashboard: `cat doc-sync-logs/metrics/sync-dashboard.md`
- Regenerate dashboard: `./doc-sync-logs/scripts/generate-metrics-dashboard.sh`
- See `doc-sync-logs/README.md` for full documentation

## How Resources Work

### Skills: Auto-Triggering

**Skill System v2.0:**
- **Skill Types:** `base` (always-on foundational context), `domain` (repo/feature-specific patterns), `meta` (skill system itself)
- **Session-Sticky:** Skills activated via file edits persist for the entire Claude Code session (stored in `/tmp/claude-skills-{hash}.json`)
- **`alwaysActivate`:** Skills with this flag activate on every prompt without needing file pattern matches
- **Content Injection:** High-priority skills inject their content inline for immediate context

**Trigger Mechanism:**
1. You edit a file in one of your repositories
2. Hook (post-tool-use-tracker) detects the file path
3. skill-rules.json is checked for matching patterns/keywords
4. If match found, skill activates on next user prompt (and stays active for the session)
5. Skill provides inline guidance + references to guidelines

**Example Flow:**
```
Edit: **[your-repo]**/backend/app/main.py
  ↓
Hook detects: **/**[your-repo]/**/*.py
  ↓
skill-rules.json: **[your-repo]**-guidelines matches
  ↓
Next prompt: Skill activates with **[your tech stack]** patterns
  ↓
Skill says: "For error handling, see guidelines/error-handling.md"
```

**Configuration:** `shared/skills/skill-rules.json`

### Agents: Explicit Invocation

**Invocation Mechanism:**
1. You or another agent uses the Task tool
2. Specify `subagent_type: "agent-name"`
3. Provide prompt describing what you want
4. Agent executes and returns result

**Example:**
```
Task tool:
  subagent_type: "code-architecture-reviewer"
  prompt: "Review authentication module"

Result: Code review with architectural feedback
```

**Available Agents:** See "Agents" section above for the full list

### Guidelines: Explicit Reference

**Reference Mechanism:**
1. CLAUDE.md lists guideline → You read it when relevant
2. Skill references guideline → You follow the link
3. Agent references guideline → Agent reads it before acting

**NOT organic discovery:** Guidelines are reference library, not browsed randomly

### Hooks: Automatic Execution

**Execution:**
- Configured in `.claude/settings.json`
- Run automatically on events (UserPromptSubmit, PostToolUse)
- No manual invocation needed

---

## File Structure

See [README.md](./README.md) for complete architecture diagram.

**Key locations:**
- **Shared resources:** `shared/{agents,skills,hooks,commands,guidelines}/`
- **Dev docs:** `dev/active/`
- **Settings:** `.claude/settings.json`

**Symlinks:**
- **Directory-based structure** with global and repo-specific subdirectories:
  - **Agents:**
    - `your-repo/.claude/agents/global/ -> ../../../orchestrator/shared/agents/global/`
    - `your-repo/.claude/agents/your-repo/ -> ../../../orchestrator/shared/agents/your-repo/` (if repo-specific agents exist)
  - **Skills:**
    - `your-repo/.claude/skills/global/ -> ../../../orchestrator/shared/skills/global/`
    - `your-repo/.claude/skills/your-repo/ -> ../../../orchestrator/shared/skills/your-repo/`
    - `your-repo/.claude/skills/skill-rules.json -> ../../../orchestrator/shared/skills/skill-rules.json`
  - **Guidelines:**
    - `your-repo/.claude/guidelines/global/ -> ../../../orchestrator/shared/guidelines/global/`
    - `your-repo/.claude/guidelines/your-repo/ -> ../../../orchestrator/shared/guidelines/your-repo/`
  - **Hooks:** Full directory symlink (same for all repos)
    - `your-repo/.claude/hooks/ -> ../../../orchestrator/shared/hooks/`
  - **Commands:** Individual file symlinks (filtered per repo type)
    - Orchestrator repo: Full directory symlink
      - `orchestrator/.claude/commands/ -> ../shared/commands/`
    - Application repos: Individual file symlinks (excluding orchestrator-only commands)
      - `your-repo/.claude/commands/dev-docs.md -> ../../../orchestrator/shared/commands/dev-docs.md`
      - `your-repo/.claude/commands/dev-docs-update.md -> ../../../orchestrator/shared/commands/dev-docs-update.md`
      - (setup-orchestrator.md excluded from application repos)
  - **Settings:** Individual file symlink
    - `your-repo/.claude/settings.json -> ../../../orchestrator/shared/settings/your-repo/settings.json`
- This structure allows selective distribution while maintaining organization

---

## Critical Conventions

### 1. Update Once in Orchestrator

**Rule:** Shared resources (agents, skills, hooks, commands, guidelines) are updated ONLY in the orchestrator.

**Why:** Changes propagate automatically to all repos via symlinks

**Example:**
- ✅ Edit `orchestrator/shared/agents/code-architecture-reviewer.md`
- ❌ Edit `your-repo/.claude/agents/code-architecture-reviewer.md` (it's a symlink!)

### 2. Test in Application Repos

**Rule:** After updating shared resources, test in at least one application repo

**How:**
- Edit file in your repo → Verify skill triggers
- Invoke agent → Verify it works
- Run command → Verify it executes

**Why:** Symlinks work, but skill patterns and references need validation

### 3. Repo-Specific vs Shared

**Centrally Managed (in orchestrator/shared/):**
- **All agents** (both generic and repo-specific)
  - **Global agents** (available to all repos): code-architecture-reviewer, refactor-planner, etc.
    - Stored in `shared/agents/global/`
  - **Orchestrator-only agents**: cross-repo-doc-sync
    - Stored in `shared/agents/orchestrator/`
  - **Repo-specific agents** (optional, per repository): frontend-specialist, backend-specialist, etc.
    - Stored in `shared/agents/{repo-name}/` (will be generated during setup if needed)
- **Skills** organized in global, orchestrator, and repo-specific subdirectories
  - Global skills in `shared/skills/global/`
  - Orchestrator skills in `shared/skills/orchestrator/` (orchestrator-only)
  - Repo skills in `shared/skills/{repo-name}/` (generated during setup)
- **Guidelines** organized in global and repo-specific subdirectories
  - Global guidelines in `shared/guidelines/global/`
  - Repo guidelines in `shared/guidelines/{repo-name}/` (generated during setup)
- **Hooks** (skill activation, file tracking) - shared by all
- **Commands** (dev-docs, setup-orchestrator) - shared by all (filtered per repo)
- **Settings** per repository in `shared/settings/{repo-name}/settings.json`

**In Each Application Repo:**
**[YOUR REPOSITORIES - will be listed here after setup]**
- **[repo-1]:**
  - Directory symlinks: `.claude/agents/global/`, `.claude/agents/repo-1/` (if exists)
  - Directory symlinks: `.claude/skills/global/`, `.claude/skills/repo-1/`
  - Directory symlinks: `.claude/guidelines/global/`, `.claude/guidelines/repo-1/`
  - Directory symlinks: `.claude/hooks/`, `.claude/commands/`
  - File symlink: `.claude/settings.json`
  - Repo's CLAUDE.md (repo-specific context)
- **[repo-2]:**
  - Similar structure with repo-2 specific subdirectories
  - Repo's CLAUDE.md (repo-specific context)
- **[etc.]**

**Key Principle:**
- **All resources managed centrally** in orchestrator (single source of truth)
- **Selective distribution** via directory structure (global + repo-specific subdirectories)
- Each repo gets access to global resources + its own specific resources
- Example: All repos get `agents/global/code-architecture-reviewer.md`, but only frontend repo gets `agents/frontend/frontend-specialist.md`

**When to update where:**
- Global agents → Orchestrator `shared/agents/global/`
- Orchestrator-only agents → Orchestrator `shared/agents/orchestrator/`
- Repo-specific agents → Orchestrator `shared/agents/{repo-name}/`
- Global skills → Orchestrator `shared/skills/global/`
- Orchestrator skills → Orchestrator `shared/skills/orchestrator/`
- Repo skills → Orchestrator `shared/skills/{repo-name}/`
- Global guidelines → Orchestrator `shared/guidelines/global/`
- Repo guidelines → Orchestrator `shared/guidelines/{repo-name}/`
- Repo-specific CLAUDE.md → That specific repo

### 4. Symlink Requirements

**Platforms:**
- ✅ macOS: Native symlink support
- ✅ Linux: Native symlink support
- ⚠️ Windows: Requires Developer Mode or administrator privileges

**Verification:**
```bash
# Check directory symlinks exist
ls -la your-repo/.claude/
# Should show:
#   agents/ (directory)
#   skills/ (directory)
#   guidelines/ (directory)
#   hooks -> ../../orchestrator/shared/hooks
#   commands -> ../../orchestrator/shared/commands (or directory with individual symlinks)
#   settings.json -> ../../orchestrator/shared/settings/your-repo/settings.json

# Check agent subdirectories
ls -la your-repo/.claude/agents/
# Should show:
#   global -> ../../../orchestrator/shared/agents/global
#   your-repo -> ../../../orchestrator/shared/agents/your-repo (if repo-specific agents exist)

# Check skills subdirectories
ls -la your-repo/.claude/skills/
# Should show:
#   global -> ../../../orchestrator/shared/skills/global
#   your-repo -> ../../../orchestrator/shared/skills/your-repo
#   skill-rules.json -> ../../../orchestrator/shared/skills/skill-rules.json

# Check guidelines subdirectories
ls -la your-repo/.claude/guidelines/
# Should show:
#   global -> ../../../orchestrator/shared/guidelines/global
#   your-repo -> ../../../orchestrator/shared/guidelines/your-repo

# Test symlink works
cat your-repo/.claude/agents/global/code-architecture-reviewer.md
# Should display agent content
```

---

## Troubleshooting

See [README.md](./README.md) and [QUICKSTART.md](./QUICKSTART.md) for detailed troubleshooting.

**Quick fixes:**

**Symlinks broken:**
```bash
# Fix directory symlinks for agents, skills, guidelines
cd your-repo/.claude
mkdir -p agents skills guidelines

# Agents
cd agents
ln -sf ../../../orchestrator/shared/agents/global global
ln -sf ../../../orchestrator/shared/agents/your-repo your-repo  # if repo-specific agents exist

# Skills
cd ../skills
ln -sf ../../../orchestrator/shared/skills/global global
ln -sf ../../../orchestrator/shared/skills/your-repo your-repo
ln -sf ../../../orchestrator/shared/skills/skill-rules.json skill-rules.json

# Guidelines
cd ../guidelines
ln -sf ../../../orchestrator/shared/guidelines/global global
ln -sf ../../../orchestrator/shared/guidelines/your-repo your-repo

# Hooks and commands
cd ..
ln -sf ../../orchestrator/shared/hooks hooks
ln -sf ../../orchestrator/shared/commands commands

# Settings
ln -sf ../../orchestrator/shared/settings/your-repo/settings.json settings.json
```

**Hooks not working:**
```bash
chmod +x orchestrator/shared/hooks/*.sh
```

**Skills not triggering:**
```bash
cat orchestrator/shared/skills/skill-rules.json | jq .
```

**Agent not found:**
```bash
- Verify `subagent_type` matches filename (without .md)
- Check agent exists in `shared/agents/global/` or `shared/agents/orchestrator/`
- Check repo-specific agents in `shared/agents/{repo-name}/`
- Verify symlinks: `ls -la your-repo/.claude/agents/global/`
```

## Notes for AI Agents

**When starting work in orchestrator:**
1. Read this file (CLAUDE.md) first
2. Check Resource Discovery Map for what's available
3. Use "When to Use What" decision tree
4. Remember: Changes here affect all repos

**When creating skills:**
- See existing repo-specific skills as examples (after setup)
- Update skill-rules.json with triggers
- Include explicit references to guidelines
- Test in application repos

**When creating guidelines:**
- Remember they're reference library, not for organic discovery
- Include "Referenced by" section
- Keep focused on one topic
- Cross-reference related guidelines

**When updating agents:**
- Add "Guidelines" section with explicit references
- Test invocation pattern
- Document in agents/README.md
