Note to agents and contributors: Keep this document up to date with any changes.

## Project Structure & Module Organization
WonderWhisper stores SwiftUI sources under `WonderWhisper/`, with views, view models, and helpers grouped by feature. Shared assets live in `WonderWhisper/Assets.xcassets`, while project settings and entitlements sit beside the sources. Unit tests reside in `WonderWhisperTests/`. Local build artifacts accumulate under `build/`, and Xcode writes derived data to `DerivedData_WW/`.

### Architecture Overview
Core components: `DictationViewModel` (orchestrates recording → transcription → OpenRouter → insertion), `MeetingCoordinator` (orchestrates dual-source meeting capture, streaming transcription, notes, and export), `HistoryStore` & `ConversationHistoryStore` (file-based JSON persistence), the `TranscriptionProvider` protocol, and service layers (`AudioRecorder`, `ScreenContextService`, `InsertionService`, `PromptHotkeyManager`). `HotkeyManager` retains only the Paste Last Carbon shortcut and shared shortcut value types. Storage paths remain under `~/Library/Application Support/HermesWhisper/` for compatibility with existing history, meeting audio, screenshots, and conversation state. The bundle identifier and Keychain service likewise retain their Hermes-era values so the WonderWhisper rebrand does not reset macOS permissions, settings, or credentials. API keys are stored in macOS Keychain via `KeychainService`.

### Microphone Selection
The app includes persistent microphone priority ordering in the sidebar. Users can choose the system
default or rank remembered microphones; unavailable choices fall through to the highest-priority
connected device and then the system default. Selection is persisted via `AudioInputSelection` and
`AudioDeviceManager` and displayed in `MicrophoneSelectionView.swift`.

## Feature Scope & Providers
- The app ships a single window with eleven sidebar tabs: History, Dictation, Command, Meetings,
  Beeper, Hermes, Vocabulary, Microphone, Compare, Permissions, and Settings. Scratchpad, Pro mode,
  and file transcription workflows have been removed; keep new work within these surfaces.
- Transcription uses Groq Whisper Large V3 Turbo through stable file upload (legacy engine ID `groq-streaming`), local Parakeet (`parakeet-local`), Soniox V5 (`soniox-streaming`), OpenRouter speech-to-text models (`openrouter-transcription`), or xAI Grok Speech-to-Text (`xai-stt`). Users pick the engine in **Settings → Transcription engine**; default is Parakeet. Do not reintroduce other providers without explicitly updating this document.
- Meetings retain separate microphone and system-audio capture tracks. System audio comes from a
  private Core Audio process tap before output volume and device routing, while ScreenCaptureKit
  supplies the selected microphone. Parakeet Unified remains the free on-device default with
  source-specific inference. Soniox V5 is an opt-in cloud beta whose default mode normalizes
  variable capture callbacks into fixed 100 ms source frames,
  timestamp-aligns both sources, uses Accelerate-backed adaptive system-audio echo reduction,
  and sends one mixed WebSocket with speaker metadata for approximately $0.12 per meeting hour. A
  two-WebSocket source-separated mode remains available as a fallback at approximately $0.24 per hour. Audio
  is retained as bounded one-minute CAF segments under `Meetings/<uuid>/`. Manual sessions capture
  all Mac system audio; automatically detected sessions restrict capture to the detected
  application scope. Trigger apps are editable: Slack and supported browsers retain strict
  Huddle/Google Meet evidence, while explicitly configured standalone apps may start on microphone
  use. Core Audio process activity wakes strict automatic-start validation immediately, with a
  two-second fallback heartbeat, while an active meeting tolerates browser
  title and individual audio-signal dropouts before a 30-second confirmed stop. Soniox non-final
  text is transient UI only; Stop ends local capture immediately while final tokens, notes, and
  export finish in a session-scoped background task. Failed live-stream tails are recovered from
  retained CAF segments with local Parakeet Unified. Full Soniox failures first recover both retained
  raw tracks with Soniox Async V5 so system-audio speaker labels survive; if that fails, local Parakeet
  remains the fallback. One cumulative late 100 ms mixed frame is tolerated before full recovery.
  Mixed capture runs on a dedicated serial ingestion worker so Soniox
  token and UI callbacks cannot starve audio delivery. If live ingestion falls behind, transcription pauses and is recovered
  later while durable audio capture continues uninterrupted. The companion includes a durable Manual notes
  tab backed by an atomically saved local sidecar; those notes remain separate from generated Markdown,
  appear in history and exports, and join the transcript only when cloud-generated notes are opted in.
  Generated notes are cloud opt-in. Optional live
  context uses its own fast OpenRouter model and sends a bounded recent transcript window to extract useful
  subjects at a rate-limited cadence, ranks Markdown locally inside the chosen Obsidian vault, and
  sends only bounded matching excerpts back to OpenRouter in one batched brief request.
- All LLM requests route through OpenRouter. Additional providers (Groq Chat, Cerebras, Ollama, etc.) are no longer part of the shipping build, so any new integration must be justified and added here.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
Use `open "WonderWhisper.xcodeproj"` to launch Xcode. For a CLI build, run `xcodebuild -project "WonderWhisper.xcodeproj" -scheme "WonderWhisper" -configuration Debug build`. Execute tests with `xcodebuild -project "WonderWhisper.xcodeproj" -scheme "WonderWhisper" -destination 'platform=macOS' test`. To run a single test, use `xcodebuild -project "WonderWhisper.xcodeproj" -scheme "WonderWhisper" -destination 'platform=macOS' test -only-testing:WonderWhisperTests/WonderWhisperTests/testName`. After a successful script build, `open build/Build/Products/Debug/WonderWhisper.app` launches the latest artifact. The project uses Swift Testing framework (not XCTest) with `@Test` annotations.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
Adopt 2-space indentation and keep lines near 100 characters. Name types with PascalCase, functions and variables with camelCase, and prefer `static let` for constants. Match filenames to the primary type (`AudioTranscriber.swift`). Imports should be organized: Foundation first, then Apple frameworks (SwiftUI, AVFoundation, etc.), then `@testable import` in tests. Favor small SwiftUI views, avoid force unwraps (use `guard` or optional chaining), use explicit error handling with `do-catch` or `throws`, and add SwiftUI previews when practical. One primary type per file. Run `swiftformat .` and `swiftlint` before posting changes when tooling is available.

## Testing Guidelines
Tests use Swift Testing framework (not XCTest). Use `@Test` annotation and name functions descriptively, such as `func freshInstallSimpleModeDefaultsMatchVoiceFirstWorkflow()`. Use `#expect` for assertions and `.disabled("reason")` to skip tests. Target audio, transcription, and provider logic first, then UI flows. Aim for ≥80% coverage on critical modules. Run `xcodebuild ... test` or Xcode's Test action prior to opening a pull request.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
Write imperative, focused commits such as `fix: handle microphone permission denial`. In PRs, describe the approach, link related issues, and flag risks. Include screenshots or GIFs for UI updates and confirm build, tests, and lint all succeed locally. Note any gaps explicitly.

## Security & Configuration Tips
Never commit secrets; use local `.xcconfig` files or Keychain values instead. Review entitlements and Hardened Runtime settings when adding capabilities. Avoid private macOS APIs and audit third-party dependencies periodically.

## Documentation Index
- `datamodel.md` — Canonical data model reference (entities, relationships, invariants, storage). Update this whenever schema/types, field names, relationships, storage paths, or configuration keys change. Include breaking change notes and update tests.

## Agent Workflow & Maintenance
- If you change build/test/run commands, directory layout, coding style/lint rules, or security practices, update this document in the same change.
- If you change the data model, update `datamodel.md` first, then add a brief summary here only if it impacts contributor workflow (e.g., migrations, new storage locations).
- Prefer small, targeted edits and add a one-line entry to the changelog below.
- When in doubt, link to source files/paths instead of duplicating long content.

## External Rules
This repository includes Cursor-specific rules in `.cursor/rules/` covering project structure, Swift style, build/test commands, testing guidelines, security/config, and commit/PR conventions. These rules are automatically applied by Cursor but summarized above for other tools.

## Changelog

  two-second fallback heartbeat and one-second stable confirmation.
- 2026-07-16: Reordered the main sidebar around history, core voice tools, meetings, integrations,
  supporting tools, and settings.
- 2026-07-16: Added remembered microphone priority ordering with automatic fallback across
  dictation and meeting capture when a preferred device is unavailable.
- 2026-07-16: Batched live context into strict 30-second transcript windows, reduced noisy topic
  discovery and broad vault matches, skipped hidden audio metering and silent-source echo work,
  reduced active meeting detection scans, bounded growing transcript persistence work, and replaced
  leaking ambient Beeper WebSocket cycles with bounded polling.
- 2026-07-15: Added ScreenCaptureKit system-audio startup fallback when the Core Audio tap is unavailable and expanded generated meeting summaries with a substantive prose TL;DR.
- 2026-07-14: Grouped genuinely overlapping recovered speakers into readable utterances while preserving sequential turn order in display and export.
- 2026-07-14: Batched native microphone callbacks before resampling, aligned mixed Soniox output across normal drift, and bounded genuine source stalls at 30 seconds with recovery.
- 2026-07-13: Preserved speaker labels during genuine Soniox full-stream recovery with async diarization, retained local Parakeet as the fallback, and stopped one harmless late audio frame from discarding a healthy live transcript.
- 2026-07-13: Required paired microphone and output activity for strict meeting liveness and reduced end confirmation to 30 seconds, so lingering browser audio cannot prevent auto-stop.
- 2026-07-13: Stopped full meeting windows from redrawing for bubble-only audio levels so long transcripts and live context remain responsive.
- 2026-07-13: Scoped automatic meeting capture to matching Core Audio helper processes so browser system audio is not recorded as silence.
- 2026-07-13: Moved live meeting ingestion off the main actor so unrelated UI and network work cannot pause transcription.
- 2026-07-13: Removed unreachable Groq chunk streaming, audio preprocessing, LLM SSE/provider abstractions, custom HTTP/2 plumbing, legacy dictation hotkey machinery, debug capture, and the empty UI-test target.
- 2026-07-13: Replaced the Hermes-style menu bar microphone with a template WonderWhisper monogram based on the app logo.

- 2026-07-11: Ported the alternate meeting HUD's compact translucent presentation and trigger-app UX, added menu-bar controls, automatic-start Keep/Discard, meeting-safe dictation muting, separate context/final-note models, local CAF tail recovery, generated titles, and Markdown/audio conveniences.
- 2026-07-11: Prevented Meet detector flapping from stopping and restarting live calls, added transient Soniox non-final captions, fixed the end-of-audio keepalive race, and moved transcript finalization behind an immediate meeting stop.
- 2026-07-11: Reduced automatic meeting confirmation to two one-second observations, replaced the blanket post-meeting cooldown with same-call suppression, and added an opt-in dual-stream Soniox V5 meeting transcription engine while retaining Parakeet as the default.
