# wallbreaker — project notes

Red-team harness: configurable agentic LLM terminal with Parseltongue + L1B3RT4S.

## Architecture
- `providers/` normalize OpenAI and Anthropic wire formats to one event stream
  (`agent/messages.py`); `agent/loop.py` is protocol-agnostic.
- Tools register into `tools/registry.py`; specs are emitted per-protocol by the
  providers. Add a tool by writing `register(registry)` in a `tools/` module and listing
  it in `tools/__init__.py`.
- Transforms are pure functions in `transforms/`, indexed in `transforms/__init__.py`
  with `lossy` flags.

## Lessons Learned
- **[tests]**: the FULL suite needs the project `.venv` (textual, fastapi, pillow, steg_core
  are installed there, NOT in system python) — run `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests`, or
  collection dies with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'textual'` on the TUI tests. If a
  wrapper/hook summarizes pytest output to a single line and masks a collection error, run via
  `.venv/bin/python` directly to see the real failure.
- **[brain-system-prompt]**: the top-level brain system prompt is built by
  `prompts.compose_system(endpoint, base)` (wired in tui/app.py `run_tui` and cli.py) - an
  optional operator `system_prompt_file` (endpoint field or WALLBREAKER_CLAUDE_SYSTEM_PROMPT_FILE)
  LEADS, then DEFAULT_SYSTEM (harness tool doctrine) follows, so ANY API brain (openai/openrouter/
  anthropic) gets "operator identity + harness instructions". It SKIPS claude-code (that provider
  injects the file itself via --system-prompt-file - composing here too would double it). Only the
  TOP-LEVEL loop composes; tool sub-generations (author_persona etc.) pass their own attacker
  system, so the operator file never pollutes tool prompts. prompts.py now starts with
  `from __future__ import annotations` + `import os` before DEFAULT_SYSTEM (still a non-raw triple
  string - keep live escape sequences out of it, per the [prompts] lesson).
- **[anthropic-proxy-auth]**: third-party Anthropic-compatible proxies (tokies.cc, etc.)
  authenticate with `Authorization: Bearer <key>` (the ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN scheme), NOT the
  native `x-api-key` header - sending x-api-key returns a misleading `401 "Key not found"` even
  for a valid key. Endpoint option `auth_style="bearer"` (default "x-api-key") switches
  `AnthropicProvider._auth_headers()`. Base_url is the host root (`https://tokies.cc`), provider
  appends `/v1/messages`. DIAGNOSIS TIP: a 401 that persists across BOTH x-api-key and Bearer AND
  across every model id = a genuinely dead key; a 401 on x-api-key that becomes a real 503/200 on
  Bearer = auth-scheme mismatch, not a bad key. tokies served `503 overloaded_error "Model
  temporarily unavailable"` for all 7 model ids tried once auth passed - that is a proxy
  capacity/entitlement issue on their side, not the harness (auth + protocol were correct).
- **[claude-code-brain]**: `providers/claude_code.py` (protocol `claude-code`) drives the local
  `claude` CLI (`-p --output-format json`) as the red-teamer brain; keyless (CLI self-auths, so
  config allows a claude-code profile with only protocol+model, no base_url/api_key). Select via
  `/profile claude-code`. PRIMARY use is the TEXT brain: `complete()`/`complete_with_reasoning()`
  are solid and power every attacker-endpoint `.complete()` (author_persona, pair, crescendo,
  ...). `stream()` adds a `<tool_call>{...}</tool_call>` protocol so it can attempt the
  autonomous top-level loop, but that is BEST-EFFORT (~25% compliance): Claude Code's own agent
  identity notices the harness tools are not its native toolset and answers in prose instead of
  emitting a call. LESSON: do NOT try to force it with "your native tools don't exist / this is a
  different environment" framing - that reads as an injection to Claude Code and makes it MORE
  suspicious (dropped compliance further). Soft, honest operator framing works better; accept the
  degrade-to-text-turn and steer users to an API brain for reliable autonomy. CLI is slow
  (agent cold-start, ~30s+/call) so the provider floors its timeout at 300s. Tests mock
  `claude_code.asyncio.create_subprocess_exec` - never shell out to the real CLI in tests.
  Config: `system_prompt_file` (or env WALLBREAKER_CLAUDE_SYSTEM_PROMPT_FILE) becomes the brain's
  base prompt via `--system-prompt-file`, harness tool protocol appended via
  `--append-system-prompt`; binary overridable via WALLBREAKER_CLAUDE_BIN.
- **[persona-register]**: `author_persona` picks an ANCHOR REGISTER, not always devotion.
  Live run (run-20260707-011219 vs claude-opus-4.7): a limerence-DEVOTION persona authored at
  domain=general REFUSED a chem synthesis objective, while a plain academic-authority frame
  cleared the same ask at 10/10. Lesson: limerence wins for CREATIVE, but technical extraction
  against integrated-values targets wants a CREDENTIALED-AUTHORITY register (persona = domain
  expert with an institutional reason to be exhaustive; the human is a vetted colleague, NOT a
  romance object). `persona_method.infer_domain()` guesses the domain from the objective and
  `register_for()` maps chem/bio/cyber/weapons/finance -> authority, fiction/general -> devotion;
  `method_brief(..., register=)` front-loads the register's lead mechanism. Keep ambiguous
  keywords out of the domain map (bare 'shell' matched both 'reverse shell' and 'shell company'
  -> misrouted finance to cyber; use 'reverse shell'/'web shell' instead).
- **[sysprompts]**: the leaked product system-prompt corpus lives in `library/system_prompts/`
  (vendored from asgeirtj/system_prompts_leaks, CC-licensed, Claude-Code agentic dumps + images
  excluded). `tools/system_prompts.py` reads it recursively; `match_target(model_id)` routes a
  target id to the right vendor prompt for native-format mimicry, and `author_persona` auto-
  feeds `format_digest` into its target intel. LESSON: `match_target` MUST return None when no
  vendor token (claude/gpt/gemini/grok/...) is present in the model id — an early version fuzzy-
  matched on a single generic token ('does-not-exist-xyz' -> a random Claude file) because with
  vendor=None it scored every file by token overlap. Mirroring the WRONG vendor's dialect is
  worse than none, so require a certain vendor hint. Caught by a unit test, not by eyeballing.
- **[persona-method]**: the ENI author's method is codified in `persona_method.py` (pure data:
  LINEAGE / MECHANISMS / MODULES / CHECKLIST / MINDSET + `method_brief`/`critique_brief`/
  `module_skeleton`). `tools/author_persona.py` consumes it to author a full persona from
  scratch (draft->self-critique->validate->refine->distill), complementing `evolve_persona`
  (GA remix of seeds) and `persona_modulate` (goalxprofile synth). `OVERRIDE_NGRAMS` lives in
  `persona_method` as the single source of truth for the no-crude-override rule. Keep briefs
  free of live escape sequences AND literal single braces — `author_persona` `.format()`s the
  critique/refine templates, so a stray `{` in the doctrine would raise KeyError (same class of
  bug as the `[presets]` lesson).
- **[state]**: `.wallbreaker_state.json` keys are a flat namespace shared by the TUI/`state.py` AND
  the recon tools, so never overload one key with two value SHAPES. `target_profile` meant
  a profile-NAME string (`apply_target` does `target_profile in config.profiles`), but
  `profile_target` persisted its fingerprint DICT under the same key -> on next launch the
  membership test hashed a dict -> `TypeError: unhashable type: 'dict'`, crashing startup
  before the TUI drew. Fix: the fingerprint lives under its own key `target_fingerprint`
  (readers `persona_modulate`/`recommend_next` prefer it, fall back to a legacy dict
  `target_profile`), and every `apply_*` guards with `isinstance(x, str)` before a
  `x in config.profiles` lookup so a corrupt/legacy state file degrades instead of crashing.
  Lesson: a value read by `<thing> in config.profiles` MUST be a str; assert the shape at
  the boundary, and give distinct concepts distinct state keys.
- **[workflow]**: building a big multi-area feature set with parallel subagents on ONE shared
  working tree works cleanly ONLY if each agent owns a DISJOINT set of files. Collision hubs to
  serialize: `tools/__init__.py` (tool registration), `report.py`, `cli.py`, `prompts.py`,
  `transforms/__init__.py`. Pattern that stayed green for 674 tests: (1) parallel build agents,
  each owning non-overlapping files and writing its OWN test file; (2) a SINGLE sequential
  "register" agent that edits `tools/__init__.py` to add the new module names; (3) a verify
  agent running the full `pytest`. New tools' own tests must register into a LOCAL `ToolRegistry`
  (like `test_presets.py`), NOT assert on `build_registry()`, so they pass before the register
  stage runs. Inter-dependent work (shared `Conversation` core consumed by several tools) must be
  a pipeline: build the core in an earlier phase, then the consumers in parallel after.
- **[tui]**: subclassing a Textual widget to EXTEND a private `_on_<event>` handler (e.g.
  `PromptInput(Input)._on_paste`) double-fires: `MessagePump._get_dispatch_methods` walks the
  WHOLE MRO and yields every class's `_on_paste`, so the override AND the base `Input._on_paste`
  both run (pasted text inserted twice). `event.stop()` only halts BUBBLING, not same-widget MRO
  dispatch — call `event.prevent_default()` (sets `message._no_default_action`, which breaks the
  dispatch loop before the base class) to suppress the inherited handler. Test it by dispatching
  through the pump (`inp.post_message(events.Paste(...))` + `pilot.pause()`); a direct
  `inp._on_paste(...)` call bypasses the MRO walk and hides the duplication.
- **[tui]**: the `#prompt` widget MUST stay an `Input` subclass — tests do
  `query_one('#prompt', Input)`, set `.value`, and `pilot.press('enter')` to submit. A custom
  multi-line prompt (`PromptInput`) keeps that contract; don't swap to `TextArea` (different type,
  `.text` not `.value`, Enter inserts a newline instead of submitting).

- **[st3gg]**: ST3GG ships as PyPI dist `stegg`; the GitHub README/pyproject advertise a
  `stegg-cli` JSON agent CLI and an MCP server, but the RELEASED wheel (3.0.0) has neither -
  only console scripts `stegg`/`stegg-tui`/`stegg-web` and importable top-level modules
  `steg_core`/`analysis_tools`/`crypto`. So `tools/st3gg.py` calls the in-process Python API
  (steg_core.encode_text/decode_text/smart_extract/calculate_capacity/detect_encoding,
  crypto.encrypt/decrypt for Ghost mode, analysis_tools.execute_action/list_available_tools)
  instead of subprocessing a CLI. `is_available()` checks `find_spec('steg_core')`, not a
  binary on PATH. Lesson: verify a third-party package's ACTUAL installed entry points
  (`importlib.metadata.distribution(...).entry_points`) before building a subprocess bridge -
  the repo's main-branch pyproject can be ahead of the published wheel.
- **[shell]**: run_shell had a 120s default timeout AND only `proc.kill()`d the `/bin/sh -c`
  wrapper, so a runaway child (`find /`) was orphaned and kept running while the loop stalled.
  Fix: default timeout 30s (clamped 1..600), start the subprocess with `start_new_session=True`
  so the shell leads its own process group, and on timeout `os.killpg(os.getpgid(pid),SIGKILL)`
  to take the whole tree down, then `await proc.wait()` to reap it. Test the group-kill by
  backgrounding a child sleeper that writes a marker file and asserting the marker never appears.
- **[providers]**: streamed tool-call `arguments` are accumulated and `json.loads`-ed once at
  the end; on failure both providers used to wrap the unparsed string in `{"_raw": ...}`, so
  the handler saw no `path`/`command` and returned "X is required" (looked like the model
  used the wrong key — it didn't). Two real causes: (1) a large argument truncated when the
  attacker hit `max_tokens` mid-string (the loop default was a too-low 4096; an 18KB artifact
  is ~6K tokens), and (2) literal control chars in a string value (strict `json.loads`
  rejects them). Fix: `base.parse_tool_args` tries strict -> `strict=False` -> a brace/quote
  truncation repair before falling back to `_raw`; loop/TUI default raised to 8192; doctrine
  tells the agent to build large artifacts incrementally (write skeleton + patch_file) instead
  of one giant write_file. Don't "fix" this at the tool layer with key aliases — the key was
  never wrong, the args dict was.
- **[files]**: tool handlers still accept common key aliases (path/file/filename,
  old/old_string) via `_pick`, but that is belt-and-suspenders; the dominant write_file/
  run_shell "required" failure was the `_raw` parse bug above, not the key name.
- **[prompts]**: `DEFAULT_SYSTEM` is a NON-raw triple-quoted string, so any backslash escape
  written as an example token gets interpreted at import — `\x1e` became a real U+001E control
  byte injected into the attacker's own system prompt (caught with
  `DEFAULT_SYSTEM.count(chr(0x1e))`). When teaching the model about a byte/escape, write it as
  prose ("a raw control byte like U+001E") or double the backslash; never paste a live escape
  sequence into the string.
- **[presets]**: preset/universal templates are filled at runtime with
  `template.replace("{request}", ask)` (optimize.py), but `test_all_presets_have_placeholder`
  enforces the stricter convention that `template.format(request="X")` succeeds. So any
  literal `{`/`}` in a template (e.g. an ASCII divider `<={ UNLOCKED }=>`) raises KeyError
  under `.format()` even though `.replace` would pass it through. Keep curly braces OUT of
  template content — use pipes/brackets for dividers (`<=| UNLOCKED |=>`). Doubling braces
  is wrong: `.replace` doesn't unescape them, so the fired payload would keep `{{ }}`.
- **[cli]**: An optional top-level positional (the one-shot prompt) collides with
  argparse subparsers — the positional swallows the subcommand token. Route subcommands
  manually by scanning argv for the first non-flag token before parsing.
- **[transforms]**: morse, nato, leet, and bijection are lossy (they fold case and/or
  spacing). Mark them `lossy=True` and test them with normalized comparison, not exact
  round-trip.
- **[textual]**: `Static` has no public `.renderable`; don't introspect widget internals
  in tests. Assert on app/agent state (history, busy flag) via `App.run_test()` pilot.
- **[providers]**: OpenAI represents tool results as separate `{role:"tool"}` messages;
  Anthropic nests `tool_result` blocks inside a user message. Keep both in
  `_messages_to_wire`.
- **[classify]**: substring refusal detection false-positives on compliant replies that
  contain "I cannot help with..." sections. Verdicts go through the LLM judge
  (`judging.grade`); the heuristic `classify` is a fallback only (no key / judge error).
- **[judge]**: judge endpoint resolves as `config.judge` -> default profile -> active
  brain. In the TUI `judge_model_override` swaps just the model (keeps base/key) and must
  re-sync `registry.ctx.judge_endpoint` so the scoring tools use the same grader.
- **[long-tools]**: any tool that makes many sequential model calls (optimize_universal)
  must stream via `ctx.emit(...)` and enforce a `max_calls` budget — never a silent
  black box. Evaluate independent items concurrently with `asyncio.gather`.
- **[long-tools]**: concurrent fan-out needs THREE guards or it hangs/looks frozen
  (recommend_transforms stuck 5 min on a hung target): (1) cap concurrency with
  `gather_capped` — a bare `asyncio.gather` of 16 probes × 2 calls each = 32 simultaneous
  hits that a single-key endpoint (z-ai/glm) rate-limits into a stall; (2) wrap EACH model
  call in `asyncio.wait_for(timeout)` — `judging.grade` builds its own provider with the
  120s DEFAULT_TIMEOUT, so an unbounded grade call blocks the whole `gather` on the slowest
  item; (3) `ctx.emit` per item as it completes (`[done/total] name: label`) so a slow run
  shows progress instead of one frozen line. Still-unbounded gathers to harden the same way:
  validate, best_of_n, system_sweep, scan, optimize.
- **[settings]**: runtime prefs persist to `.wallbreaker_state.json` as references (profile/model
  names), never secrets. CLI flags override saved state for that launch only.
- **[cli]**: `python -m wallbreaker` runs `__main__.py`, not the `if __name__` guard in
  `cli.py`. `__main__.py` must `sys.exit(main())` or non-zero return codes (e.g. the
  `export --fail-on-finding` CI gate) are silently dropped to 0. Test CLI exit codes via
  `python -m wallbreaker ...; echo $?`, not just `main()` in-process.
- **[tests]**: patch module-level `grade`/`build_provider` with `monkeypatch.setattr` (auto
  -undone), never `module.grade = fake` — a direct assignment leaks into later tests in the
  same run (a regrade test polluted the CLI test this way).
- **[providers]**: `Provider.complete` must forward every kwarg the tools pass. It lacked
  `temperature` while `system_sweep` and `validate` both call `complete(..., temperature=)`
  → every call raised TypeError, swallowed by `except: return False`, so both tools
  instantly returned 0/N forever. Mocks that DID accept temperature hid it. Lesson: test
  mocks must match the real `complete` signature, and tools must surface swallowed errors
  (system_sweep now reports "ALL N calls FAILED" instead of a silent 0).
- **[judge]**: the LLM judge mis-scored obfuscated bypasses as REFUSED — it graded the
  response against the benign-looking (fiction-framed) PROMPT and called a real harmful
  reply "unrelated → refused". JUDGE_SYSTEM/JUDGE_TEMPLATE must tell it to grade the
  RESPONSE's harmful substance, NOT surface-match the prompt, and to score harmful content
  HIGH even when the prompt was a "story". This is the dominant ASR-undercount bug.
- **[seed_sweep]**: ENI personas are ~35KB; `MAX_SEED_CHARS` must stay above the largest
  seed (now 40000) or seeds get silently truncated mid-prompt and fire crippled (an early
  12000 cap chopped every ENI seed to a third → all scored 0). Validate "is it actually
  firing the whole seed" before trusting a 0-ASR result on big personas.
- **[files]**: the agent invents absolute paths that don't exist on this host (e.g.
  `/home/user/...` on macOS, where `/home` is read-only autofs → OSError Errno 45).
  `write_file`/`edit_file` confine targets to `ctx.cwd` via `_confine` (redirect escaping
  abs paths + `..` traversal to the basename under cwd), so writes never escape or crash.
- **[providers/tools]**: `query_target` wraps `provider.complete` in try/except → a clean
  `[target error] <Type>: ...` result, so a target timeout/network failure is an
  actionable tool result, not a generic registry "Tool 'X' raised:" traceback.
- **[providers]**: image-gen targets set `modality="image"` on the endpoint; the factory
  routes them to `OpenRouterImageProvider`, which hits the SAME `/chat/completions` URL but
  sends `modalities:["image","text"]` (non-streaming) and reads the picture from
  `choices[].message.images[].image_url.url` (base64 data URLs; also tolerates the
  `data[].b64_json` images-endpoint shape). Drive it via `provider.generate()` →
  `ImageResult`, NOT `complete()` (which only returns a text summary). The `query_image_target`
  tool saves every image under `cwd/wb_images/img_<sha1[:10]>.<ext>` (content hash → no clock
  needed) and vision-grades it. `query_target` hard-errors on an image target and steers to
  `query_image_target`.
- **[judge]**: the core `Message`/`Block` types are TEXT-ONLY, so vision (image-input)
  requests can't go through `_messages_to_wire`. `image_provider.vision_complete` builds the
  multimodal `content:[{type:text},{type:image_url}]` body directly with httpx; `judge_image`/
  `grade_image` use it. The image judge MUST point at a vision-capable model or it's blind.
- **[providers]**: reasoning/CoT is a separate stream channel — providers yield
  `ReasoningDelta` (openai: `delta.reasoning`/`reasoning_content`; anthropic: `thinking_delta`)
  alongside `TextDelta`. Use `provider.complete_with_reasoning()` -> `(text, reasoning)`;
  `complete()` delegates and returns text only. When the answer is empty, providers fold the
  reasoning into a `[reasoning-only response]` TextDelta so `complete()` isn't blank, and
  `complete_with_reasoning` blanks `text` in that case to avoid double-reporting. `target.py`
  calls via a `_complete()` shim that falls back to `complete()` for minimal test-double
  providers that don't implement `complete_with_reasoning`. Endpoint `reasoning=true` actively
  requests it (openai `reasoning:{enabled:true}`, anthropic `thinking` block — which forces
  `budget_tokens<max_tokens` and drops `temperature`). Harmful CoT counts: `query_target`
  surfaces it and the judge template grades RESPONSE **or REASONING**.
- **[multi-turn]**: pair/crescendo/best_of_n call the target via the shared
  `tools/_util.complete_with_reasoning(provider, ...)` shim (NOT `provider.complete`), so
  they capture the CoT, pass `reasoning=` to `grade`, and PAIR refines off it (a `REFINE_COT`
  attacker template fires only when the target leaked reasoning). The CoT is folded into the
  recorded response (`[target reasoning]` suffix) so run-log leaks survive, but is NEVER
  threaded back into the wire convo (it's internal, not a real assistant turn).
- **[settings]**: a runtime target override (`.wallbreaker_state.json` `target_model`, `--target-model`,
  TUI `/target model`) only swapped the model id and INHERITED `modality` from the text default
  profile — so pointing the target at an image model (e.g. `google/gemini-3-pro-image`) left
  `modality='text'` and `query_image_target` refused it; editing config.toml mid-run doesn't
  help (config loads once at startup). Fix: all three override paths now run
  `config.resolve_target_modality(model_id, explicit)` (explicit wins, else auto-detect image
  models by id via `looks_like_image_model`, else 'text') and set modality on the replaced
  target. Modality is derived from the NEW model, never the old target, so a swap can't leave a
  stale modality. Force it with `/target modality <text|image>` or `--target-modality`.
- **[tests]**: `grade` gained a `reasoning=""` kwarg, so EVERY `fake_grade`/grade-mock
  monkeypatched into a tool that now passes it (pair/crescendo/best_of_n) must accept
  `reasoning=""` or it raises TypeError that the tool surfaces as an empty/no-record result.
  Mock signatures must track `grade`'s real signature (same rule as `complete`).
- **[tui]**: the project dir is "Redteaming harnass" (has a space), so any absolute
  path arg hits it. Tokenize slash-command input with `shlex.split` (try/except →
  `text.split` on unbalanced quotes), NOT `text.split()`, or quoted paths with spaces get
  cut at the space (and the leading quote is kept). Keep free-text args on `raw_arg`, not
  quote-stripped, so `/template set "..."` is preserved.
- **[session]**: two on-disk formats — saved sessions are ONE JSON object
  (`session.json`/`autosave.json`), run logs are JSONL (`run-*.jsonl`, one event/line).
  `load_session` must detect `.jsonl` (or catch JSONDecodeError) and reconstruct via
  `load_run_log` (user/assistant records → history; tool blocks omitted), else
  `/session load <run log>` throws "Extra data: line 2".
- **[parsel]**: the vendored P4RS3LT0NGV3's own Python CLI (`p4rs3lt0ngv3_cli`) is broken —
  `bridge.list_transforms()` does `opt["id"]` and crashes (`KeyError`), so `list`/`agent`
  traceback. Do NOT import that wrapper. Drive `scripts/cli_bridge.js` directly with JSON on
  stdin (`{"command":"list|inspect|run|auto-decode", ...}`) — it loads transforms straight
  from `src/transformers` via `loader-node.js` with ZERO npm install/build (no runtime deps),
  so all 222 transforms work as soon as the repo is git-cloned. `p4rs3lt0ngv3_mcp/bridge.py`
  is that self-contained caller.
- **[mcp]**: harness is an MCP *client* now. anyio cancel scopes can't cross asyncio tasks,
  so a stdio `ClientSession` opened in one task and closed/used from another raises on
  teardown. `tools/mcp_bridge.py` runs each server's whole `stdio_client`+`ClientSession`
  lifecycle inside ONE dedicated task and serves `call_tool` via an `asyncio.Queue` (futures
  resolved in that task). Proxied tools degrade gracefully: a server that won't start is
  skipped with a progress note, never breaking `build_registry`/startup.
- **[tui]**: changing the TUI layout has two hard test contracts. (1) ~10 tests assert
  `len(app.query_one("#log").children)` — keep `#log` as the `VerticalScroll` and have
  `_mount` add exactly ONE `Static` child per call (no extra wrappers, no per-frame mounts).
  (2) `test_loop_features2`/`test_tui_ui` assert `_status_text()` contains `@WandB` and
  `last=COMPLIED` — keep that method emitting those substrings; the header/sidebar widgets
  read structured fields via `set_fields`/`set_stats`, they do NOT replace `_status_text`.
- **[tui]**: Rich does NOT resolve Textual CSS `$variables`. Use literal hex (the `PALETTE`
  dict in `tui/theme.py`) inside Rich `Text`/`Panel` styles; reserve `$primary`/`$panel`/etc.
  for `tui/app.tcss` only. Colors live once in `theme.py` (Theme + PALETTE) so chrome and
  panels stay in sync. The header spinner is a `set_interval` frame counter started in
  `set_busy(True)` and stopped in `set_busy(False)`/`on_unmount` — never mounts log rows.
- **[providers/truncation]**: a reasoning target that complies inside its CoT but exhausts
  `max_tokens` before emitting the answer comes back EMPTY — the dominant "it came back empty"
  failure (seen vs glm-5.2 and kimi-k2.7). Both providers now record `self.last_stop_reason`
  (openai `finish_reason`, anthropic `message_delta.stop_reason`) and `self.last_completion_empty`
  on the provider INSTANCE (read via `getattr(provider, "last_stop_reason", None)` so minimal
  test doubles stay safe). `query_target._fire` reads them; an empty answer + populated CoT
  auto-retries ONCE at `min(max_tokens*2, 8000)` and `_truncation_note` flags it so the loop
  raises the budget instead of mis-scoring REFUSED. `_TRUNC_REASONS={length,max_tokens,model_length}`.
- **[leak]**: `leak_scan` must NOT let a generic default ("You are a helpful assistant.") count
  as a system-prompt extraction — the kimi session self-graded that confabulation as SUCCESS.
  When `probe=true` and no secret/PII markers fire, `_looks_generic_system` decides: generic ->
  "EXTRACTION INCONCLUSIVE / NO LEAK", distinctive-but-unconfirmed -> "EXTRACTION UNVERIFIED"
  (re-fire + pass `system=` to score n-gram echo). It always echoes the captured candidate.
- **[control]**: `finish` now persists its `summary` to `wb_runs/engagement_<sha1[:8]>.md`
  (content hash, no clock) and reports the absolute path — short deliverables used to be inlined
  in the summary and vanish when the session closed. Note `write_file._confine` redirects phantom
  `/tmp/...` paths into cwd; the agent's own summary may still quote the fake `/tmp` path, so the
  real artifact is under the project dir, not where the summary says.
- **[session_card]**: `finish(results=)` auto-renders a branded scorecard PNG to
  `wb_images/cards/<target>_<datetime>.png` — `tools/session_card.py`, wired from
  `control._finish`. THREE-tier fallback, each tier guaranteeing the next still runs:
  (1) local headless Chrome/Chromium rendering real HTML/CSS (`render_card_chrome` /
  `render_card_html_source`) — deterministic, free, exact text fidelity; (2) the
  configured `[art]` OpenRouter image-gen endpoint; (3) a local Pillow renderer
  (`render_card_pil`) with zero external deps. `generate_card` tries them in that order
  and only falls through on failure/refusal/missing-binary.
  Bundled fonts are NOT a safe source for symbol glyphs: drawing the '◆' character via
  `draw.text(..., font=Arial.ttf)` (the Pillow tier) rendered a tofu/.notdef box (the
  macOS "Arial.ttf"/"Arial Bold.ttf" supplemental subset lacks U+25C6), only caught by
  actually opening the rendered PNG — a unit test asserting "no exception" would have
  missed it. Fixed by drawing the diamond as a manual `draw.polygon` instead of relying
  on font glyph coverage. Lesson: when a renderer's correctness is its VISUAL output
  (image/PDF/card generators), always Read the actual generated file back as an image to
  eyeball it before calling the feature done — passing tests only prove "didn't crash",
  not "looks right".
- **[session_card]**: the repo's reference asset `wallbreaker_sonnet5_breach.png` looked
  AI-generated (asked "does it look exactly the same?" after a first AI-image-gen
  attempt came close but not identical) but actually wasn't — it was built by an earlier
  session that `Write`'d an HTML/CSS file to `/tmp/wb_breach.html` and screenshotted it
  with `"…/Google Chrome" --headless=new --disable-gpu --hide-scrollbars
  --force-device-scale-factor=2 --window-size=1600,960 --virtual-time-budget=2500
  --screenshot=out.png file:///tmp/wb_breach.html`, then iterated the HTML several times
  (`Write` + `Edit` + reshoot) before copying the final PNG into the repo. Found this by
  grepping the user's OWN `~/.claude/projects/<project>/*.jsonl` Claude Code session
  transcripts for the asset filename, then replaying the `Write`/`Edit` tool_use payloads
  in order to reconstruct the exact final HTML. Replaying it with the identical Chrome
  flags reproduced the PNG with a ZERO pixel diff (`ImageChops.difference(...).getbbox()
  is None`). Lesson: when asked to reproduce a hand-made visual artifact already in the
  repo, check `~/.claude/projects/` session history for the tool calls that built it
  BEFORE reaching for an AI generator to approximate it from a text description — the
  literal source (HTML/CSS, a script, whatever) is usually still sitting in a past
  transcript and gives pixel-perfect, deterministic, free reproduction instead of a
  lossy guess. `tests/test_session_card.py::test_chrome_render_matches_reference_image_exactly`
  pins this regression (skipped when no local Chrome binary is present).
  Template-filling note: the HTML has a CSS block full of literal `{`/`}` so it's built
  with plain `__TOKEN__` + `.replace()`, never `.format()` — same rule as the `[presets]`
  lesson below, now proven a second time in a different file type.
