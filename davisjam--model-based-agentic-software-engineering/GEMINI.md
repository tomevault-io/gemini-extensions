# AGENTS.md — running editorial folds on the MAGE book with a fleet

This file is the **operational playbook** for making large editorial changes to the book
(`book/`) with dispatched agents. It extends `CLAUDE.md` §"Working on this repo with a fleet"
(single-live-writer + parallel drafting), which you should read first. Where `CLAUDE.md` states
the *rules*, this file gives the *worked process* — the one that lands a multi-part copyedit pass
in one sitting without serializing on `main` and without a merge that fights 100 generated files.

The method has four patterns. Use them together: **draft in parallel → fold in parallel worktrees →
merge by source-checkout → resolve the model layer once at the end.**

---

## 0. The one fact everything follows from

`main` has a single-live-writer rule for exactly one reason: the `pre-commit` hook rebuilds the
site and **force-stages the regenerated `.html` + derived `book-models/*`** on every commit, so two
agents committing to the *same branch* collide on those generated files. **Everything else about the
book is deterministic from source.** That single fact is what makes the patterns below safe:

- Two folds on **separate worktree branches** never collide (separate git indexes).
- Two folds touching **disjoint source trees** (different Parts / the appendices) never conflict on
  content — only on regenerated files, which you never merge, you **rebuild**.
- A **PDF renders from the working tree**, not from `HEAD` — so you can build a review PDF from
  staged-but-uncommitted source.

---

## 1. Pattern — disjoint-worktree parallel folds

When several folds touch **disjoint source trees** (e.g. Part II prose, Part III prose, appendices),
run them **concurrently in separate git worktrees** instead of serially on `main`.

**Setup, per fold:**
1. `git worktree add -b <fold>-fold <path> HEAD` (branch from current `main`; put `<path>` in a
   scratch dir).
2. ★ **Copy the drafts into the worktree.** `book/_design/drafts/` is **gitignored**, so a fresh
   worktree checkout does *not* contain the EDIT-MAP or the authored figures. Without this the agent
   has nothing to fold:
   `cp -r book/_design/drafts/<effort>-<date> <worktree>/book/_design/drafts/`
   (they stay untracked in the worktree — the hook never stages them).
3. Dispatch the fold agent with its **CWD = the worktree** and a brief that says: you are on branch
   `<fold>-fold`, confirm with `git branch --show-current`, **do NOT touch `main`**, other folds run
   concurrently on disjoint trees — ignore them.

**Before you trust "disjoint":** `git diff --name-only main...<otherbranch>` and confirm no overlap
on **source** (exclude `.html` and the flip-floppy derived book-models — see §3). Shared
*hand-authored* book-models (`figure-caption-tiers.json`, `chapter_identity/shape`, `index-terms.md`)
are the only real overlap surface; have each agent **report** which of those it touched.

---

## 2. Pattern — the standard copyedit-fold brief ("just land the copyedits")

When the job is an editorial/copyedit pass and the goal is to **land prose fast for review**, not to
perfect the model layer, give the agent this contract:

> **Don't worry about cross-coherence or the model layer — just APPLY the edits per the EDIT-MAP and
> commit through the hook.** The prose is authoritative (it's the just-reviewed copy). Where a model
> or registry disagrees with the landed prose, that's a *deferred* item, not a reason to touch prose.

Concretely, the brief must say:
- **Gate cadence = the fast hook only.** Per commit, just `git commit`; the `pre-commit` hook runs
  `catalog.py validate` (~7s) + `build` + the `book-float-ref` gate. That is the correctness net.
  **Do NOT run `catalog_tests.py`** (the ~238s model suite) and **do NOT self-verify** any
  model/suite-level check. Model resolution is a separate batch-repair (§4).
- **Commit early and often** — per `§`-section or per appendix. The API is flaky; never hold a large
  uncommitted batch. (A prior fold died on an API drop and lost an uncommitted batch — commit-per-
  section makes that a non-event.)
- **Guardrails:** NEVER `git add -A` (sweeps `book/_design/`), NEVER `--no-verify` (skips the
  force-stage), never stage `book/_design/` or `scratchpad/`. Carry the co-author trailer.
- **Report the shared files it touched** (the book-models in §1) so the merge can hand-union them.

If a genuinely load-bearing scope question arises (a brief contradicts an EDIT-MAP, two lanes might
own the same figure), the agent should **defer the call to the orchestrator**, not guess — a wrong
guess on a shared file becomes a merge conflict.

---

## 3. Pattern — the merge (source-checkout, never `git merge`)

A real `git merge` of a fold branch conflicts on ~100 regenerated `.html` files. Don't. Land the
branch's **source only** and let the hook regenerate everything derived:

1. **List the branch's source files** (exclude generated + flip-floppy derived):
   `git diff --name-only main...<branch> | grep -vE '\.html$|book-models/(projection-index|reverse_index|outline|outcomes|chapter_identity|metaphor-slogan-index)\.json$|book-models/models-view\.html$'`
2. **Confirm disjointness** vs what `main` gained since the branch point:
   `comm -12 <(sort branch-src) <(sort main-since)` → empty.
3. **Check out the source onto main:** `git checkout <branch> -- <those files>`.
4. **Hand-union shared hand-authored book-models** (`figure-caption-tiers.json`,
   `chapter_identity/shape`, `index-terms.md`) if more than one fold touched them — union the
   *disjoint entries*; do **NOT** `git checkout <branch> -- <shared-file>` (that clobbers the other
   folds' entries).
5. **Commit.** The hook regenerates all `.html` + derived book-models from the merged source —
   generated files reconcile deterministically, no manual merge.
6. **Verify:** `git diff HEAD <branch> -- <source-paths> | wc -l` → 0 (a large `.html` diff is
   expected generated noise, not a real discrepancy).
7. Repeat per branch (incremental — land each fold as it finishes; `main` moving between merges is
   fine because the trees are disjoint).

**Gotchas that will bite you:**
- **`build_book.py --pdf` reads the WORKING TREE, not `HEAD`.** You can build a review PDF from
  staged-but-uncommitted source — useful under a deadline when the commit is still blocked.
- **A `git stash push/pop` (e.g. during diagnosis) UNSTAGES files.** If you stash to run a clean
  check, re-`git add` before committing, or the commit captures only part of the merge. Fix a partial
  merge commit with `git add <src> && git commit --amend` (verify with
  `git show HEAD --stat` that all source landed).
- **`build_book.py` is itself source** in this repo (it carries embedded tables) — if a fold edits it,
  include it in the source-checkout list.

---

## 4. Pattern — deferred batch-repair (land hook-green, resolve models once)

Under a deadline you can **decouple landing from model-correctness**:

- **`build_book.py --pdf` is independent of `catalog_tests.py`.** Its own gates are content-integrity
  only (duplicate glossary marker, unknown cite key, missing metric token). So **hook-green source
  builds a correct PDF regardless of model perfection.** Land every fold hook-green, build the PDFs
  for review, and defer the model layer.
- Then run **one batch-repair** that drives `catalog_tests.py` to green: register drifted terms, re-
  verify `claims_model` (a claim's anchor point can move when a later fold rewrites the section it
  pointed into — re-repoint `claims_declared.json` then `claims_model.py regenerate`), reconcile any
  metaphor a fold killed in prose but left in a model, fix concept-card parity, re-derive stale
  `chapter_shape` anchors, and settle caption tiers (`lint_caption_length` is "hard, no dispensation"
  — a caption a fold *simplified* below its tier-A floor gets **reclassed A→B**, not padded back).
- **Align models to the landed prose, never the reverse** — the prose is the reviewed copy.
- Finish with a fresh PDF and, when the user is ready, the **single** `catalog.py deploy github`
  (nothing is published until then; local PDFs are build artifacts).

---

## 5. Cleanup

- `git worktree remove --force <path>` (the copied drafts are disposable).
- Keep the fold branches as backup until the batch-repair confirms green; delete them after.
- The book publishes **once**, at the very end (`deploy github`) — resist per-fold republishes.

---

*Provenance: this playbook was distilled from a multi-part editorial pass (Parts II/III surgical
rewrites + appendix sync) run as three parallel worktree folds under a review deadline, merged by
source-checkout, with the model layer resolved in a single batch-repair afterward.*
