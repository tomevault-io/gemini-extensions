# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**Playbooks** is an innovative Python framework for building and executing AI agents using "playbooks" – structured workflows defined in natural language (via Markdown-based .pb files) or Python code. This framework represents a significant step toward Software 3.0, where natural language becomes a first-class programming language.

## Core Architecture

### Framework Components

#### 1. Language & Execution
- **Natural Language Programming**: Write workflows in plain English that compile to executable code
- **Hybrid Execution Stack**: Seamless interoperability between Markdown (natural language) and Python execution
- **Compiler-Driven Reliability**: `.pb` files compile to `.pbasm` (assembly) format with semantic static analysis

#### 2. Agent System
- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Built-in support for distributed agents with communication protocols
- **Agent Types**: Local AI agents, remote AI agents, human agents, MCP agents, system agents
- **Agent Registry**: Dynamic agent discovery and integration capabilities

#### 3. Execution Engine
- **Program Class**: Core execution orchestrator managing playbook lifecycle
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Reactive programming with triggers and event bus
- **Call Stack Management**: Unified call stack for both natural language and Python execution

### Key Architectural Insights

#### Compilation Pipeline
The compilation flow from `.pb` → `.pbasm` involves:
1. **Loader** (`loader.py`) reads and validates playbook files
2. **Compiler** (`compiler.py`) uses LLM to preprocess content, adding line type codes (QUE, CND, etc.)
3. **AST Generation** (`markdown_to_ast.py`) converts compiled content to executable structure
4. **Program** (`program.py`) orchestrates execution using the compiled AST

#### Agent Threading Model
- Migrated from threading to pure async/await architecture (`AsyncAgentRuntime` in `program.py`)
- Each agent runs as an independent asyncio task
- Message passing between agents is handled through the event bus
- Agent lifecycle managed through `start_agent()` and `stop_agent()` methods

#### Message Flow Architecture
1. **Messages** created with specific types (MessageType enum)
2. **Event Bus** (`event_bus.py`) handles message routing between agents
3. **Agents** subscribe to specific message patterns
4. **Execution State** (`execution_state.py`) maintains context across message handling

#### Playbook Execution Modes
- **Local Playbooks**: Direct execution within the same process
- **Remote Playbooks**: Network-based execution via MCP transport
- **Python Playbooks**: Direct Python function execution with decorator support
- **LLM Playbooks**: Dynamic playbook generation and execution

#### MCP Integration
- **Transport Layer** (`transport/mcp_transport.py`): Handles WebSocket/SSE connections
- **MCP Agents** (`mcp_agent.py`): Bridge between MCP servers and playbook system
- **Protocol** (`transport/protocol.py`): Defines message format and handshake

## Key Features

### 1. Compilation System
- **Semantic Static Analysis**: Infers intent, adds annotations (QUE, CND), variables/types
- **Intermediate Representation**: `.pb` → `.pbasm` compilation for reliable execution
- **Runtime Optimization**: Reduces LLM hallucinations through structured guidance

### 2. Agent Communication
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**: Standard for agent-to-agent communication
- **Transport Layer**: WebSocket, SSE, and other transport protocols
- **Message Routing**: Intelligent message routing between agents

### 3. Development Tools
- **CLI Interface**: Command-line tools for running and compiling playbooks
- **VSCode Extension**: Debugging and development support
- **Rich Console Output**: Enhanced terminal experience with rich formatting

## Debugging & Development Tips

### Debugging Playbooks
```bash
# Enable debug mode for verbose output
playbooks run --debug example.pb

# Use the VSCode extension for step-by-step debugging
# Set breakpoints in .pb files after installing the extension
```

### Common Issues & Solutions
1. **Async Context Errors**: Ensure all playbook execution happens within async context
2. **Agent Communication**: Check event bus subscriptions if agents aren't receiving messages
3. **Compilation Errors**: Validate playbook structure - requires agent name header and proper sections
4. **MCP Connection Issues**: Verify MCP server is running and transport URLs are correct

### Performance Considerations
- Use caching for compiled playbooks (enabled by default)
- Agent tasks run concurrently - design message handlers to be thread-safe
- LLM calls can be expensive - use appropriate models for the task
