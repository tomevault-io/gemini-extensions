## §1 — Lean Principles

| # | Principle | This project |
|---|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | Eliminate waste (Muda) | Every line of code has a cost; every unused feature is waste |
| 2 | Map the value stream | Changes ship as updates to a portable Python CLI and supporting docs/tests that users run directly on their own machines. |
| 3 | Create flow | Most work stays inside one monolithic Python CLI plus adjacent docs/tests, so progress comes from small verified edits instead of module churn. |
| 4 | Establish pull | Build only what is needed, when it is needed |
| 5 | Seek perfection | Small, continuous improvements (Kaizen) over big rewrites |

**Waste taxonomy** (§6):

- Overproduction · Waiting · Transport · Over-processing · Inventory · Motion · Defects · Unused talent

---

## §2 — Operating Modes

Switch modes explicitly. Default is **Implement**.

### Implement Mode (default)

- Plan → implement → test → document in one uninterrupted flow.
- Full PDCA for every non-trivial change.
- Three-check ritual before marking a full task complete end-to-end.

### Review Mode

- Read-only by default. State findings before proposing fixes.
- Tag every finding with a waste category (§6).
- Use format: `[severity] | [file:line] | [waste category] | [description]`
- Severity: `critical` | `major` | `minor` | `advisory`

  <examples>
  `[critical] | [src/auth.ts:42] | [W7 Defects] | SQL query built by string concatenation — injection risk; use parameterised queries`
  `[minor] | [src/utils/format.ts:18] | [W4 Over-processing] | One-liner wrapped in a function with no added value — consider inlining`
  </examples>

#### On-Demand Review Skills

For deeper audits, activate the matching skill (§12) instead of expanding §2:

- **Extension audits** → `extension-review` skill · **Test coverage** → `test-coverage-review` skill
- Present report first; wait for approval before writing files.

### Refactor Mode

- No behaviour changes. Tests must pass before and after.
- Measure LOC delta. Flag if a refactor increases LOC without justification.

### Planning Mode

- Produce a task breakdown before writing code.
- Estimate complexity (S/M/L/XL). Flag anything XL for decomposition.

---

## §3 — Standardised Work Baselines

| Baseline | Value | Action if exceeded |
|----------|-------|--------------------|
| File LOC (warn) | 250 lines | Flag, suggest decomposition |
| File LOC (hard) | 400 lines | Refuse to extend; decompose first |
| Dependency budget | 6 runtime deps | Propose removal before adding |
| Dependency budget (warn) | 5 runtime deps | Flag for review |
| Test command | `python3 -m pytest tests/ -v` | Must pass before the full task is done |
| Type check | `python3 -m mypy icloud_downloader.py --check-untyped-defs` | Must pass before task is done |
| Three-check ritual | `python3 -m py_compile icloud_downloader.py && python3 -m mypy icloud_downloader.py --check-untyped-defs && python3 -m pytest tests/ -v` | Run before marking complete |
| Integration test gate | RUN_INTEGRATION_TESTS=1 | Set to run integration tests |
| Max subagent depth | 2 | Stop and report to user |

---

## §4 — Coding Conventions

- Language: **Python** · Runtime: **Python 3.10+** · Package manager: **pip**
- Test framework: **pytest**
- Preferred serialisation: **JSON and JSONL**

**Patterns observed in this codebase**:

- Single-file CLI architecture centered on `icloud_downloader.py`
- Security-first path validation, name sanitization, and owner-only permissions
- Thread-safe helper classes protect shared state in concurrent download flows
- Sequential and concurrent execution paths are kept semantically aligned
- Documentation, examples, and dry-run workflows are treated as first-class UX surfaces

**Universal rules**:

- No `any` / untyped unless explicitly commented with `// deliberately untyped: <reason>`.
- No silent error swallowing — log or re-throw.
- No commented-out code — git history is the undo stack.
- Imports are grouped: stdlib → third-party → internal. One blank line between groups.
- Functions do one thing. If you need "and" in the name, split it.
- Read before claiming — never describe, reference, or modify a file not opened this session.
  `semantic_search` or `grep_search` confirms existence; reading the file confirms content.

**Terminal discipline**:

- For high-volume commands, capture the full output to a log file and print only a bounded tail instead of streaming everything.
- If the repo documents a terminal-safe wrapper for a noisy command, prefer it over the raw command when using terminal tools.
- Prefer repo scripts or bash wrappers over ad hoc shell control flow when a command needs exit-status plumbing, redirection, or retries.
- A single existing command with no shell control flow, tempfile plumbing, redirection, or shell-specific syntax may run directly in the terminal.
- If the repo provides a generic isolated-shell wrapper, use it for ad hoc one-liners or multi-step snippets instead of relying on the persistent terminal's current shell state.
- If the repo provides a stdin or here-doc isolated-shell wrapper, use it for multi-line snippets and shell-specific syntax.
- Never run `set -euo pipefail` or `setopt errexit nounset pipefail` as a standalone terminal command in the persistent zsh session. Shell integration hooks can inherit that global state and terminate the session on the next prompt cycle.
- For ad hoc strict-mode one-liners, prefer a repo wrapper if one exists. Otherwise run the snippet through a child Bash process with strict mode enabled instead of mutating the parent zsh session.
- For multi-line strict-mode snippets, prefer a dedicated stdin or here-doc wrapper when the repo provides one. Otherwise run the snippet through a child Bash process with strict mode enabled instead of mutating the parent zsh session.
- Use shell-specific child wrappers for zsh, `sh`, or PowerShell syntax instead of assuming the persistent terminal is already in the right shell.
- In zsh workspaces, avoid reserved variable names such as `status`; use `rc`, `exit_code`, or `command_rc` instead.
- Do not rely on profile files, aliases, or exported shell options for ad hoc snippets. Child wrappers should start from a clean shell state.
- If a failure is caused by shell semantics rather than the underlying command, stop retrying equivalent one-liners and switch to a repo script or simpler direct invocation.

## §5 — PDCA Cycle

Apply to every non-trivial change.

**Plan**: State the goal. List the files that will change. Estimate LOC delta. For non-trivial tasks that span multiple files or introduce new behaviour, write a brief requirements summary before coding. Realign before proceeding if that summary changes the plan.
**Do**: Implement. Write tests alongside code, not after.
**Check**: During intermediate phases or multi-part tasks, run the narrowest deterministic targeted suites for the touched paths when available. If the blast radius includes shared helpers, broad contract surfaces, or no reliable mapping exists, broaden aggressively. Run `python3 -m pytest tests/ -v` only before marking the full user task complete end-to-end. Review output. Fix before proceeding.
**Act**: If baseline exceeded, address it now. Summarise what changed.

### Test Scope Policy

| Tier | Meaning | Use when |
|------|---------|----------|
| `PathTargeted` | Narrow deterministic checks mapped to touched paths | Default during intermediate work |
| `AffectedSuite` | Broader checks for shared helpers or broad contract surfaces | Path-targeted coverage is too narrow |
| `FullSuite` | Entire local test suite | Before marking the full task complete |
| `MergeGate` | Verified state required before merge, release, or final handoff | The change is ready to leave the working session |

- **Task complete** means the full user-visible task is finished end-to-end and the required verification has passed, not that one phase of a larger plan is done and not that one item in a multi-part TODO list is done.
- During intermediate phases, prefer deterministic path-based targeted suites tied to the files or directories actually touched.
- If the repo documents a targeted-test selector or phase-test command, use it to choose deterministic phase checks from changed paths instead of guessing the phase-time suite set manually.
- If multiple sub-parts are still in progress, do not treat a passing targeted subset as permission to declare the whole task complete.
- Broaden early when changes touch shared helpers, broad policy surfaces, parity mirrors, or any area without a reliable targeted test mapping.
- Final gate: before marking the full task complete, run the full suite with `python3 -m pytest tests/ -v`.

### Structured Thinking Discipline

Before acting on any medium-to-complex task, apply this decision sequence to avoid
loop traps and wasted tokens:

1. **Frame** — state the problem in one sentence. If you cannot, the task needs
   decomposition before proceeding.
2. **Intent-Gate** — if the prompt is ambiguous, compound, or lacks scope, ask
  one clarifying question before acting. Never start execution on a prompt
  that could plausibly mean two different things.
3. **Gather** — identify the minimum information needed to act. Search once with
   broad terms; do not repeat the same search with minor variations.
4. **Decide** — choose an approach and commit. If two approaches seem equal, pick
   either and move forward. Do not oscillate.
5. **Act** — implement the chosen approach in one pass. Do not re-read files you
   have already read unless the content has changed.
6. **Verify** — check the result once. If it fails, diagnose the root cause before
   retrying. Never retry the same action expecting a different result.

**Anti-loop rules** (apply to all agents and subagents):

- **3-strike rule**: if the same tool call or search returns unhelpful results
  three times, stop and reformulate the approach or ask the user for guidance.
- **No circular re-reads**: do not re-read a file within the same task unless
  you have made changes to it since the last read.
- **Monotonic progress**: each step must produce new information or new output.
  If a step produces nothing new, skip it and move to the next.
- **Scope lock**: once Plan is set, do not expand scope mid-task. If new work
  is discovered, note it for a follow-up task.
- **Time-box exploration**: limit exploratory searches to 5 tool calls per
  sub-question. If the answer is not found, surface the gap to the user.

## §8 — Living Update Protocol

Copilot may edit this file when patterns stabilise. Rules:

1. **Never delete** existing rules without explicit user instruction.
2. **Additive by default** — append to sections; don't restructure them.
3. **Flag before writing** — describe the change and wait for confirmation on edits to §1–§7.
4. **Self-update trigger phrases**: "Add this to your instructions", "Remember this for next time" — these add a convention to this file.
5. **Template updates**: When the user says **"Update your instructions"** (or any variant listed in the Canonical triggers table of `AGENTS.md`), this means: go to the upstream template repository at `https://github.com/asafelobotomy/copilot-instructions-template`, fetch the latest version, compare it against the installed version, and run the update protocol defined in `UPDATE.md`. This is not a request to make arbitrary edits — it is specifically a check-for-upstream-updates command.

### Attention Budget

This file is loaded into the LLM context on every interaction. To prevent instruction-following degradation from context dilution:

| Scope | Budget | Enforced by |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| **Entire file** (§1–§13) | ≤ 800 lines | CI (`ci.yml`) |
| **§2 (Operating Modes)** | ≤ 210 lines | CI (`ci.yml`) — largest section; contains all workflow modes |
| **Other §1–§9 sections** | ≤ 120 lines each | CI (`ci.yml`) |
| **§10 (Project-Specific Overrides)** | No hard limit | Grows with project — review during heartbeat |
| **§11–§13 (protocols)** | ≤ 150 lines each | CI (`ci.yml`) |

**Overflow rule**: When a section approaches its budget, extract detailed procedures into a skill file (`.github/skills/`), a path-specific instruction file (`.github/instructions/`), or a prompt file (`.github/prompts/`). Leave a one-line reference in the main section. This keeps the always-loaded context tight while preserving the detail in on-demand files.

**Why this matters**: LLMs exhibit attention degradation in long contexts — content in the middle of a large prompt receives less focus than content near the start or end. Keeping the core instructions concise ensures every rule gets reliable attention.

### Heartbeat Protocol

Event-triggered health checks that keep the agent aligned with real project state. The heartbeat checklist lives in `.copilot/workspace/HEARTBEAT.md`.

**When to fire**: session start; after a task that trips the medium/large heuristic (one strong signal: 8+ modified files or 30+ minutes; or two supporting signals: 5+ modified files, 15+ minutes, context compaction); after any refactor, migration, or restructure task; after dependency manifest changes; after CI failure resolution; when a medium/large task completes; on the trigger phrase "Check your heartbeat"; or on any custom trigger defined in `HEARTBEAT.md`.

**Procedure**:

1. Read `HEARTBEAT.md` — follow it strictly. Do not infer tasks from prior sessions.
2. Run every check in the Checks section. Cross-reference: MEMORY.md (consolidation), TOOLS.md (dependency audit), SOUL.md (reasoning alignment), §10 (settings drift).
3. If the trigger is **explicit** and the user asked for a retrospective, call the `session_reflect` MCP tool and process its output silently.
4. If the session is **medium/large**, call the `session_reflect` MCP tool when the Stop hook instructs you to do so. Treat medium/large as one strong signal (8+ modified files or 30+ minutes active) or two supporting signals (5+ modified files, 15+ active minutes, context compaction). Skip it for small/localized tasks.
5. Update Pulse: `HEARTBEAT_OK` if all checks pass; prepend `[!]` with a one-line alert for each failure.
6. Append a row to History (keep last 5).
7. Write observations to Agent Notes for the next heartbeat.
8. Report to user only if alerts or actionable retrospective findings exist — silent when healthy.
9. **Context limit**: if context pressure is high, run `save-context.sh`, append a resume note to Agent Notes, then continue — never abandon a task mid-flight.

### Agent Hooks

Hooks are deterministic shell commands that VS Code executes at specific lifecycle points during an agent session. Unlike instructions (soft guidance), hooks run your code with guaranteed outcomes — they enforce rules that the agent would otherwise follow probabilistically.

Hook configuration lives in `.github/hooks/copilot-hooks.json`. VS Code supports eight lifecycle events. The template wires all eight events using deterministic scripts:

| Event | Primary script(s) | Purpose |
|-------|-------------------|---------|
| `SessionStart` | `session-start.sh`, `pulse.sh --trigger session_start` | Inject project context and initialize heartbeat state |
| `UserPromptSubmit` | `pulse.sh --trigger user_prompt` | Detect explicit heartbeat and retrospective prompts |
| `PreToolUse` | `guard-destructive.sh` | Block dangerous commands; flag caution patterns for user confirmation (§5 enforcement) |
| `PostToolUse` | `post-edit-lint.sh`, `pulse.sh --trigger soft_post_tool` | Auto-format edited files and debounce heartbeat soft triggers |
| `Stop` | `scan-secrets.sh`, `pulse.sh --trigger stop` | Run secret scan and recommend retrospective only for medium/large completed tasks |
| `PreCompact` | `save-context.sh`, `pulse.sh --trigger compaction` | Preserve workspace state before context compaction |
| `SubagentStart` | `subagent-start.sh` | Inject governance context (depth limit, inherited protocols) when a subagent spawns |
| `SubagentStop` | `subagent-stop.sh` | Log subagent completion and prompt result review |

---

## §9 — Subagent Protocol

When spawning subagents:

- The parent/default agent follows this protocol too: if a request is primarily
  specialist work, delegate to the matching agent instead of absorbing the
  specialist workflow inline.
- Each `.github/agents/*.agent.md` declares an `agents:` allow-list restricting which subagents it may invoke. Respect these boundaries.
- Keep allow-lists narrow. Add a subagent only when the agent body defines a concrete workflow for using it. Do not keep speculative delegates "just in case".
- Prefer the lightest valid handoff: use `Explore` for read-only repo scans, `Researcher` for current external docs, `Audit` for residual-risk or security checks, and `Organise` for pathing or file moves.
- Preferred specialist map: `Explore` for read-only repo scans, `Researcher`
  for current external docs, `Review` for formal code review or architectural
  critique, `Audit` for health, security, or residual-risk checks,
  `Extensions` for VS Code extension, profile, or workspace recommendation
  work, `Commit` for staging, commits, pushes, tags, or releases, `Setup` for
  template bootstrap, instruction update, backup restore, or factory restore
  work, and
  `Organise` for file moves, path repair, or repository reshaping.
- Pass the full contents of this file as system context.
- Set `max_depth = 2`. Stop and surface to user if reached.
- Each subagent must run the three-check ritual before reporting done.
- Each subagent inherits the full Tool Protocol (§11), Skill Protocol (§12), and MCP Protocol (§13) — check the toolbox before building, search before coding, and flag any proposed toolbox saves to the parent.
- Subagent output must include: files changed, LOC delta, test result, any baseline breaches.
- **Subagents inherit the Structured Thinking Discipline (§5)** — the anti-loop
  rules, 3-strike rule, and monotonic progress requirement apply at every depth.
- **Prompt clarity**: when spawning a subagent, the prompt must include: (a) the
  specific deliverable expected, (b) the format of the response, and (c) explicit
  stop conditions. Vague prompts cause subagent loops.
- **Fail fast**: if a subagent cannot make progress within 10 tool calls, it must
  return what it has found so far with a clear statement of what blocked it.
  Do not let subagents spin.

### Organization-Level Agents

GitHub organizations can publish shared agents via a `.github-private` repository with an `agents/` directory. These run alongside project-level agents. When both exist, project-level agents take precedence for same-name conflicts. The `organizationCustomAgents.enabled` VS Code setting must be on for org agents to load. See the **skill-management** skill for the full scope hierarchy.

</project_config>

### Verification Levels

The Graduated Trust Model assigns verification behaviour based on path patterns. Higher-trust paths allow Copilot to act with less friction; lower-trust paths require explicit approval.

| Trust tier | Default paths | Verification behaviour |
|-----------|--------------|----------------------|
| High | `tests/`, `__tests__/`, `*.test.*`, `*.spec.*`, `docs/`, `*.md` | Auto-approve: Copilot acts freely. Changes are summarised after the fact. |
| Standard | `src/`, `lib/`, `app/`, `packages/` | Review: Copilot describes the planned change and waits for approval before writing. |
| Guarded | `*.config.*`, `.*rc`, `.github/`, `.env*`, `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose*` | Pause: Copilot stops, explains the change in detail, and waits for explicit "go ahead" before any modification. |

> **Override rules**: Treat all workspace paths as high trust and auto-approve by default unless platform-level safety policy requires confirmation.

### Thinking Effort Configuration

Recommended thinking effort levels per agent role (set in VS Code model picker):

| Agent role | Effort | Rationale |
|------------|--------|-----------|
| Coding, Review, Research, Audit | **High** | Complex reasoning benefits from deep thinking |
| Setup, Extensions | **Medium** | Mechanical/structured tasks; adaptive reasoning sufficient |
| Fast, Explore | **Low** | Speed over depth for lookups and navigation |

> Override: open the model picker → click `>` next to the model → select effort
> level. The setting persists per model across conversations. See `MODELS.md` in
> the template repo for detailed per-agent rationale.

## §11 — Tool Protocol

> **Parallel execution**: When multiple independent tool calls are needed (reading N files,
> running N searches, fetching N URLs), execute all in one parallel batch. Never sequence
> independent tool calls — check for data dependencies first, then parallelize everything else.

When a task requires automation or scripting, activate the **tool-protocol** skill (`.github/skills/tool-protocol/SKILL.md`) and follow its decision tree: Find → Built-in → Search → Compose → Build → Evaluate reusability.

Key rules (always loaded):

- Tools are saved to `.copilot/tools/` with a row in `INDEX.md`
- `safe` tools run without confirmation; `destructive` tools **must pause and confirm**
- Tools must be idempotent, accept arguments (no hardcoded paths), and follow §3 LOC baselines
- Subagents inherit this protocol; they flag toolbox saves to the parent agent

---

## §12 — Skill Protocol

Skills are reusable markdown-based behavioural instructions following the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) open standard. Activate the **skill-management** skill (`.github/skills/skill-management/SKILL.md`) for the full discovery and activation workflow.

Key rules (always loaded):

- Skills are loaded **on demand** — read `SKILL.md` only when its `description` matches the current task
- Priority: project (`.github/skills/`) > personal (`~/.copilot/skills/`) > agent plugins (`@agentPlugins`)
- Agent plugins (VS Code 1.110+) distribute skills alongside agents — activate the **plugin-management** skill for discovery and conflict resolution
- Subagents inherit this protocol; they flag skill creation to the parent agent

---

## §13 — Model Context Protocol (MCP)

MCP enables Copilot to invoke external servers beyond built-in capabilities. Configuration lives in `.vscode/mcp.json`. Activate the **mcp-management** skill (`.github/skills/mcp-management/SKILL.md`) for server configuration and management.

Key rules (always loaded):

- **Always-on** servers: filesystem, git — enabled by default
- **Credentials-required** servers: github, fetch — need token configuration
- The MCP `memory` server has been removed — VS Code's built-in memory tool (`/memories/`) provides superior persistent storage with three scopes (user, session, repository)
- Never hardcode secrets — use `${input:}` or `${env:}` variable syntax
- Subagents inherit access; they flag new server additions to the parent agent
