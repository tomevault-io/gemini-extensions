## Project

**A2C Logistics CO. — Driver Recruiting Site**

A full rebuild of `a2clogistics.com` — a driver-recruiting site for **A2C Logistics CO.**, a Lincoln, NE trucking company. The site is built for **two audiences only — owner-operators (lease-on) and company drivers (W2)** — and exists to convert visiting drivers into qualified leads for A2C's recruiting team.

The current Vite/React site mixes shipper messaging (Services, Fleet) with driver messaging across six generic pages. The new site drops shipper content entirely, leads with a story-driven *"driver-first"* identity, and routes every visitor toward a single quick-apply form. A dedicated section introduces the four sister brands in the A2C ecosystem (LTTR, LTS, DP, OTTS), reinforcing the *"you're joining an ecosystem, not just a fleet"* differentiator.

**Core Value:** **Every visiting driver — owner-op or company — leaves the site having either submitted the quick-apply form, or knowing exactly who A2C is and why "Driven to be different" is more than a tagline.** Conversion is the bar; trust is the moat.

### Constraints

- **Tech stack**: Open — no strong preference. SEO is critical (driver-job search queries), so the working assumption is **Next.js (App Router) + Tailwind 4 + MDX** unless the planning phase surfaces a better fit. Astro is the alternative if interactivity stays minimal. Existing `package.json` deps (framer-motion, lucide-react, base-ui, shadcn) carry over where useful.
- **Content**: All copy, pay numbers, testimonials, and structured data live in MDX/markdown in the repo (no headless CMS). Edits are made via PR or a git-based CMS UI like TinaCMS.
- **Hosting**: Netlify or Cloudflare Pages (final pick deferred to deployment phase). Both support Next.js SSG/SSR and Edge Functions for the form handler.
- **Form delivery**: Submissions email recruiting + write a row to a Google Sheet or Airtable. Built behind a swappable adapter so a future ATS (Tenstreet/DriverReach) can replace the email/sheet sink without rebuilding the form UI.
- **Brand fidelity**: Nevis Bold typography is licensed — need a licensed copy or web-font equivalent before launch. Color palette and logo system are non-negotiable per the brand book.
- **Compliance**: DOT/FMCSA recruiting copy norms apply (no protected-class questions, voluntary consent for recruiter contact). Privacy policy required because of PII collection.
- **Performance**: Mobile-first; LCP < 2.5s on 4G; no layout shift on hero or testimonial swaps.
- **Accessibility**: WCAG AA minimum.
- **Single-site scope**: This project is A2C Logistics CO. only. Sister brands are referenced and linked, never absorbed.

## Technology Stack

## TL;DR — Recommended Stack
| Layer | Pick | Confidence | Why for *this* project |
|---|---|---|---|
| Framework | **Astro 6 (`astro@6.2.2`)** | HIGH | SEO-first, ships ~0 JS by default, native MDX content collections with Zod schemas, native `Image` + font optimization, Cloudflare/Netlify adapters are first-party. The two interactive needs (form, OO/Company toggle) are textbook Astro Islands. |
| Styling | **Tailwind CSS v4 (`tailwindcss@4.2.4`) via `@tailwindcss/vite`** | HIGH | Already the user's choice, v4 stable, Astro/Vite plugin is the canonical install. CSS-first config = no `tailwind.config.js`. |
| Component primitives | **shadcn/ui CLI v4 (`shadcn@4.6.0`) — Astro template** | HIGH | The shadcn CLI v4 (March 2026) added a first-class Astro template. Same components/registry the user already knows from React. |
| Content | **Astro Content Collections + `@astrojs/mdx@4.4.3`** with **Zod schemas** | HIGH | Frontmatter-typed pay numbers, testimonials, brand data. No second toolchain (Velite/Fumadocs unnecessary). |
| Form library | **Conform (`@conform-to/zod` + `@conform-to/react`)** | HIGH | Progressive enhancement (works without JS), Zod-shared schema between Astro Action handler and the React island. Same Zod schema validates client + server. |
| Form transport | **Astro Actions** (server endpoint at `/_actions`) | HIGH | Type-safe, runs on the host's serverless runtime, Astro's native pattern in v5+. |
| Form sinks | **Resend (`resend@6.12.2`) for email + Google Sheets API or Airtable REST** behind a small adapter | HIGH | Resend is the modern default for transactional email; the adapter satisfies REQ-FUNNEL-02 + the "swappable so an ATS can replace it" constraint. |
| Spam protection | **Cloudflare Turnstile (`@marsidev/react-turnstile@1.5.1`) + honeypot field** | HIGH | Free, privacy-friendly, no user-visible CAPTCHA, works on either host. |
| Hosting | **Cloudflare Pages** (primary recommendation) — Netlify is a defensible second choice | MEDIUM | See "Host Decision" section below. Cloudflare wins on free-tier function invocations and global edge; Netlify wins on DX polish and built-in form/email plumbing. |
| Fonts | **`next/font/local`-equivalent in Astro: `astro:assets` Fonts API + self-hosted licensed Nevis Bold + Fontsource for Avenir-alike** | HIGH | Foundry-license fonts must be self-hosted (no CDN). Astro's Fonts API (stable in 6.x) handles `font-display: swap`, preload, subsetting. |
| Icons | **`lucide-astro`** (or keep `lucide-react` for the React islands) | HIGH | Same icon set the user already has; `lucide-astro` has zero JS cost in static spots. |
| Animation | **Motion (`motion@12.38.0`)** — successor to framer-motion, plus **CSS View Transitions API** for page transitions via Astro's built-in `<ClientRouter />` | HIGH | `framer-motion` was renamed to `motion` (same maintainer, same API). For a marketing site, View Transitions handle 80% of "page transitions" without JS; reserve Motion for hero reveals and the OO/Company toggle. |
| Analytics | **Plausible** (hosted) or self-hosted Umami | HIGH | Cookie-free, no consent banner needed in most US contexts, lightweight (<1 KB). |
| Validation | **Zod (`zod@4.4.3`)** | HIGH | Powers content collection schemas, Conform, and the Astro Action input schema — one library, three jobs. |
## 1. Framework — Astro vs. Next.js for *this* project
### Recommendation: **Astro 6**, not Next.js
- Per-driver dashboards, authenticated pages, ISR with on-demand revalidation
- A blog with 100+ posts where Next's RSC streaming pays off
- An app with a real database and many route handlers
- If the team is already deep in Next and switching cost > the perf delta
- A typical 6-page Astro marketing site with one React island: **~5–25 KB JS** total (the island only).
- Equivalent Next.js App Router site: **~85–110 KB JS** (React runtime baseline) + island code.
- Lighthouse mobile performance gap is consistently in the 8–15 point range on 4G throttling, driven almost entirely by main-thread parse/eval time.
## 2. Host Decision — Cloudflare Pages vs. Netlify
| Dimension | Cloudflare Pages | Netlify |
|---|---|---|
| Astro adapter | `@astrojs/cloudflare@13.3.1` — first-party | `@astrojs/netlify` — first-party |
| Free tier — builds | 500 builds/month, 20-min timeout, 1 concurrent | 300 build minutes/month, 1 concurrent |
| Free tier — function invocations | **100,000/day** combined Workers + Pages Functions (resets midnight UTC) | 125,000/month total |
| Edge runtime location | True global edge (Workers run at CDN PoPs) | "Edge functions" exist but most invocations land in a single region |
| Preview deployments | Yes, every PR/branch | Yes, every PR/branch |
| Image optimization | `astro:assets` with `cloudflare-binding` runtime image service | Netlify Image CDN, `_redirects`-based |
| Built-in form handling | None — you write the function | **Netlify Forms** (`data-netlify="true"`) — free tier ~100 submissions/month, beyond that you pay |
| Built-in email integration | None — use Resend/Postmark | Email Integration extension exists |
| DNS handoff | Cloudflare DNS (fast, free) | Netlify DNS (free) — or external |
| Edge cold starts | Effectively zero (Workers) | Lambda-style cold starts (~100-300ms) on edge functions |
| DX polish | Improving fast but rougher edges | More polished, more obvious |
| Pricing past free tier | Cheap and linear | Steeper jumps |
### Pick: **Cloudflare Pages** (primary), Netlify as the safe alternative
## Recommended Stack — Detail
### Core Technologies
| Technology | Version | Purpose | Why Recommended |
|---|---|---|---|
| Astro | `6.2.2` | Static site generator + island runtime + content collections | Zero-JS by default, MDX-native, first-party Cloudflare/Netlify adapters, Server Islands for any future personalization. v6 (released early 2026) refined the Actions API and added typed `serverIslandMappings`. |
| `@astrojs/mdx` | `4.4.3` | MDX support inside Astro | Official integration; combines with `astro:content` for typed frontmatter. |
| `@astrojs/cloudflare` | `13.3.1` | Astro adapter for Cloudflare Pages | First-party, supports SSR + static hybrid, includes `cloudflare-binding` image service. |
| Tailwind CSS | `4.2.4` | Utility-first styling | Already chosen. v4 is stable; CSS-first config (`@theme` block in CSS); ~5x faster builds than v3. |
| `@tailwindcss/vite` | `4.2.4` | Tailwind Vite plugin | Canonical Tailwind v4 install. Astro uses Vite under the hood, so this is the standard path. |
| Zod | `4.4.3` | Schema validation | Powers content collection schemas, form validation (Conform), and Astro Actions input shape. Single library, three roles. |
| Conform | latest (`@conform-to/react`, `@conform-to/zod`) | Progressive-enhancement form library | Works without JS, shares Zod schema between client + server, designed for Astro Actions / Remix / Next App Router. |
| React | `19.x` | UI runtime for the two interactive islands (form, pay toggle) | Already known by the team; lets us reuse the existing `lucide-react`, `class-variance-authority`, `clsx`, `tailwind-merge`, `@base-ui/react` deps. |
| `@astrojs/react` | latest | Astro integration to mount React islands | Required to use React inside Astro. |
| Motion (formerly framer-motion) | `motion@12.38.0` | Animation library for hero reveals, micro-interactions | `framer-motion` was renamed to `motion` (same author, identical API in v12). Use `motion/react` or `motion/react-client` for SSR-friendly imports. |
### Supporting Libraries
| Library | Version | Purpose | When to Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| Resend | `6.12.2` | Transactional email API | The "email recruiting on submit" half of REQ-FUNNEL-02. Better deliverability than Gmail SMTP, $0 for first 3,000 emails/month. |
| `@marsidev/react-turnstile` | `1.5.1` | Cloudflare Turnstile React component | Spam protection on the apply form. Free, no CAPTCHA UX, works on Netlify too. Server-side verification in the Astro Action. |
| `googleapis` | latest | Official Google Sheets API client | The "write to Google Sheet" half of REQ-FUNNEL-02. Service-account auth; one row per submission. |
| `airtable` | latest | Airtable REST client | Alternative to Google Sheets if the user prefers; identical adapter shape. |
| `lucide-astro` | latest | Lucide icons as `.astro` components | Zero-JS icon rendering inside `.astro` files. Keep `lucide-react` for the React islands. |
| `@fontsource-variable/...` | varies | Self-hosted variable fonts via NPM | For Avenir alternative (e.g. `@fontsource-variable/inter` or `@fontsource/nunito-sans`) if a licensed Avenir copy isn't acquired. |
| Plausible Analytics | hosted | Cookie-free analytics | One `<script>` in the layout, no consent banner needed. ~1 KB. Custom events for form-step abandonment. |
| `astro-seo` | latest | SEO meta-tag helper | Standard Astro pattern for OG tags, Twitter cards, JSON-LD. |
| `schema-dts` | latest | TypeScript types for schema.org JSON-LD | For local-business + job-posting structured data — directly improves "owner operator jobs Nebraska" SERPs. |
### Development Tools
| Tool | Purpose | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Vite | Astro's underlying dev server / bundler | Comes with Astro; no separate install. |
| TypeScript | Type safety end-to-end | Astro is TS-first; `strictest` preset recommended. |
| Prettier + `prettier-plugin-astro` | Code formatting | Required to format `.astro` files. |
| ESLint + `eslint-plugin-astro` + `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y` | Linting + a11y checks | a11y plugin matters for REQ-SITE-05 (WCAG AA). |
| Lighthouse CI | Perf budgets in CI | Enforce LCP < 2.5s on mobile (REQ-SITE-04) on every PR. |
| `@axe-core/playwright` | Accessibility regression tests | Optional but cheap insurance for WCAG AA. |
| Wrangler | Cloudflare CLI for local Pages dev + deploy | Required for Cloudflare Pages local dev with Functions. |
## Installation
# 1. Scaffold a fresh Astro project (replace existing repo wholesale)
# 2. Add integrations
# (or: npx astro add react mdx netlify  — if going Netlify)
# 3. Tailwind v4 (CSS-first; no PostCSS config file needed)
# 4. shadcn/ui — Astro template (CLI v4, Mar 2026)
# 5. Form + validation + spam
# 6. Email + sheet sink
# 7. Animation + icons
# 8. Analytics (hosted Plausible — just a script tag, no install)
#    OR self-host Umami separately.
# 9. SEO
# 10. Tooling
## 3. MDX Pipeline — Decision
### Pick: **Native `astro:content` + `@astrojs/mdx` + Zod schemas**
- **Velite** — designed to add Astro-style content collections to Next/Vite/etc. Astro already has them.
- **Fumadocs** — built for *documentation sites*. Overkill, and pulls Next.js along.
- **`next-mdx-remote`** — only relevant if you pick Next.js.
- **TinaCMS** — keep as an *optional later add-on* if non-technical edits become a need. TinaCMS now ships `tinacms@3.7.5` and supports both Astro and Next; it sits on top of your existing MDX/markdown so it's a non-breaking add later. Don't pull it in for v1 (REQ-OPS extra surface area).
## 4. Form Handling — Decision
### Pick: **Conform + Astro Actions + Resend + Sheets/Airtable adapter + Turnstile**
- Conform is built for the *progressive enhancement* world Astro inhabits — the form posts and works even before the React island hydrates (truck-stop wifi).
- Single Zod schema validates client AND server (the Astro Action). RHF can do this with `@hookform/resolvers/zod`, but Conform makes server-side validation the primary citizen instead of an afterthought.
- The form isn't complex enough (≤6 fields) to need RHF's render-optimization machinery.
## 5. Typography & Icons — Decision
### Pick: **Self-host licensed Nevis Bold via Astro Fonts API. Avenir likewise. Lucide for icons.**
## 6. Animation — Decision
### Pick: **Motion (`motion@12`) for component animations + Astro's `<ClientRouter />` (View Transitions API) for page transitions**
## Alternatives Considered
| Recommended | Alternative | When to Use Alternative |
|---|---|---|
| Astro 6 | Next.js 16 (App Router) | If a driver portal/dashboard with auth lands on the same domain, or if the team is committed to React Server Components. |
| Astro 6 | SvelteKit | Only if the team prefers Svelte and is willing to abandon the React/shadcn ecosystem. |
| Astro 6 | Remix / React Router 7 | Skip for marketing sites — RR7 ships React on every page. |
| Cloudflare Pages | Netlify | If you want zero custom code for forms (`data-netlify="true"`) or are already on Netlify across A2C ecosystem brands. |
| Cloudflare Pages | Vercel | User explicitly excluded Vercel. (Otherwise it'd be a fine third option for Next.js, irrelevant for Astro.) |
| Conform | react-hook-form + `@hookform/resolvers/zod` | If the team knows RHF cold and the form grows past 6 fields with complex conditional logic. |
| Astro Content Collections | Velite | If you ever need cross-framework content (e.g. share MDX between Astro and a separate Next.js dashboard). |
| Astro Content Collections | TinaCMS | Add later if non-technical staff need to edit pay numbers without git. Tina layers on top of MDX, so it's non-breaking. |
| Resend | Postmark / SendGrid | Both are fine; Resend has the nicest DX and free tier for an MVP. |
| Cloudflare Turnstile | hCaptcha | Use only if you specifically need its bot-detection signals; Turnstile is friendlier UX. |
| Cloudflare Turnstile | Google reCAPTCHA v3 | Avoid — privacy issues and a Google cookie that triggers consent-banner requirements in some jurisdictions. |
| Plausible | Umami (self-hosted) / Fathom | Umami is free if self-hosted; Fathom is the closest paid competitor. Avoid GA4 if cookie-free is desired. |
## What NOT to Use
| Avoid | Why | Use Instead |
|---|---|---|
| Vercel | User explicitly excluded. | Cloudflare Pages or Netlify. |
| `@next/mdx` for content-heavy sites | No frontmatter typing without bolt-on tooling; ships React runtime cost. | Astro content collections. |
| `next-mdx-remote` | Adds parse-at-request overhead unless you build-cache it; a workaround for a problem Astro doesn't have. | Astro content collections. |
| `tailwindcss@3.x` | Out of date; v4 is stable, ~5x faster, CSS-first config. | `tailwindcss@4.2.x`. |
| `tailwind.config.js` (with v4) | v4 deprecates JS config in favor of CSS `@theme`. Adding a JS config in v4 works but is the legacy path. | CSS `@theme` block. |
| `framer-motion` (the package) | Renamed to `motion`; new development happens there. | `motion@12` (`import { motion } from "motion/react"`). |
| Google reCAPTCHA v2/v3 | Visible challenge / Google cookie / privacy issues. | Cloudflare Turnstile. |
| Google Fonts CDN for licensed fonts | License violation for foundry-licensed fonts; render-blocking script in some setups. | Self-host with Astro Fonts API. |
| Google Analytics 4 | Cookie banner required, heavy script, hostile DX. | Plausible / Umami / Fathom. |
| Sanity / Contentful / Storyblok | Out of scope per PROJECT.md (no headless CMS). | MDX in repo + optional TinaCMS later. |
| `react-router-dom@7` (in the new build) | Existing dep is for a Vite/React SPA. Astro doesn't need a router; pages are file-based. | File-based routing in `src/pages/`. |
| jQuery, anything Webpack-era | No reason in 2026. | — |
| Heavyweight UI kits (MUI, Chakra, Mantine) | Style conflicts with Tailwind v4, ship 100+ KB of CSS-in-JS. | shadcn/ui — copy components, own the code. |
## Stack Patterns by Variant
- Use `next@16.2.x` App Router, `@vercel/mdx` or build-time MDX with `generateStaticParams`.
- Deploy via `@opennextjs/cloudflare@1.19.x` (Cloudflare) or the official Netlify Next plugin.
- Replace Conform with react-hook-form + zod resolver inside a Server Action.
- Replace Astro Content Collections with **Velite** (`velite@0.3.x`) for typed MDX.
- Lose ~15 Lighthouse mobile points vs. the Astro baseline. Accept it as the cost of the unified app.
- Adapter: `@astrojs/netlify` (swap from `@astrojs/cloudflare`).
- Optional shortcut: skip Astro Action + Resend for the email half — use `data-netlify="true"` on the `<form>` and Netlify Forms catches submissions, then a Netlify Function fires the Sheet/Airtable write. Saves backend code; couples you to Netlify.
- Use Netlify's Image CDN instead of `cloudflare-binding` for `astro:assets`.
- Use the URL search-param (`?role=oo` vs `?role=company`) so SEO crawlers index both states and drivers can share a link to the OO view.
- Server-render the right variant in the Astro page (`Astro.url.searchParams`), hydrate the toggle as a small client island.
- This avoids needing a SPA router; preserves the SSR + SEO posture.
## Version Compatibility
| Package A | Compatible With | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `astro@6.2.x` | `@astrojs/mdx@4.4.x`, `@astrojs/react@4.x`, `@astrojs/cloudflare@13.3.x` | All first-party, version-locked by Astro releases. |
| `tailwindcss@4.x` | `@tailwindcss/vite@4.x` (NOT `@tailwindcss/postcss`) | Astro uses Vite; the Vite plugin is the canonical path. PostCSS plugin exists but is the wrong choice here. |
| `motion@12.x` | React 18 + 19 | `import { motion } from "motion/react"`. SSR-safe in App Router via `motion/react-client`. |
| `react@19.x` | `@types/react@19.x`, all current React libraries | Existing project already on React 19. |
| `zod@4.x` | `@conform-to/zod` (current), `@hookform/resolvers@5.x` if you switch to RHF | Zod 4 is a notable breaking change from 3.x — check resolver version. |
| `@marsidev/react-turnstile@1.5.x` | React 18 + 19 | Server-side verification: `POST https://challenges.cloudflare.com/turnstile/v0/siteverify`. |
| `lucide-react@1.x` (existing) and `lucide-astro@latest` | Same icon registry, different render path | OK to use both side-by-side. |
| `shadcn@4.6.x` (CLI) | Tailwind v4, Astro template, Next/Vite/RR/TanStack Start | The March 2026 CLI v4 release added Astro support. Use it. |

## Confidence Levels — Per Recommendation
| Recommendation | Confidence | What would change the call |
|---|---|---|
| Astro over Next.js | **HIGH** | If a driver portal/dashboard with auth lands on this same domain, or the Pay page becomes an interactive calculator with deep state — flip to Next.js. |
| Tailwind v4 + Vite plugin | **HIGH** | None — already user-chosen and v4 is stable. |
| shadcn/ui (Astro template) | **HIGH** | None — same components the user already uses; CLI v4 has Astro support. |
| Astro Content Collections + MDX | **HIGH** | Only if cross-framework content sharing becomes a need (then Velite). |
| Conform over RHF | **MEDIUM-HIGH** | If the team knows RHF cold and form grows past 6 fields with complex conditional logic — switch to RHF. |
| Astro Actions for the form | **HIGH** | None — native pattern. |
| Cloudflare Pages over Netlify | **MEDIUM** | If the team values minimum custom code (Netlify Forms shortcut) or runs other A2C brands on Netlify — flip to Netlify. |
| Resend for email | **HIGH** | None for an MVP; swap to Postmark if deliverability issues surface (rare). |
| Cloudflare Turnstile | **HIGH** | None — best-in-class privacy + UX in 2026. |
| Self-hosted Nevis via Astro Fonts API | **HIGH** | Only changes if foundry doesn't sell a self-host web license — then need a substitute display font. |
| Motion (`motion@12`) over framer-motion-the-name | **HIGH** | None — same maintainer, same API, just the canonical name now. |
| View Transitions API (via Astro `<ClientRouter />`) for page transitions | **HIGH** | None — native browser API, free perf. |
| Plausible / Umami / Fathom for analytics | **HIGH** | Only if marketing requires GA4 attribution data. |
