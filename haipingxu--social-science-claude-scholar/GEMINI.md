### Tech Stack Preferences

**Primary Tools**:
- **Writing**: LaTeX (primary), Overleaf for collaboration
- **Statistical analysis**: Stata (current primary) → Python (transitioning)
- **Package manager**: `uv` - modern Python package manager

**Python Ecosystem (transitioning from Stata)**:
- **Causal inference**: `statsmodels`, `linearmodels`, `econml`, `doubleml`, `causalml`
- **Data**: `pandas`, `numpy`, `pyarrow`
- **NLP / Text as Data**: `transformers`, `gensim`, `spacy`, `bertopic`
- **Visualization**: `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotnine` (ggplot2 equivalent)
- **Stata bridge**: `pystata`, `stata_setup`

**Git Standards**:
- **Commit convention**: Conventional Commits
  ```
  Type: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, chore
  Scope: data, analysis, paper, config, utils, workflow
  ```
- **Branch strategy**: master/develop/feature/bugfix/hotfix/release
- **Merge strategy**: rebase for feature branch sync, merge --no-ff for integration

---

## Global Configuration

### Language Settings
- **Respond in English to the user**
- Keep technical terms in English (e.g. NeurIPS, RLHF, TDD, Git)
- Do not translate proper nouns or names

### Working Directory Standards
- Plan documents: `/plan` folder
- Temporary files: `/temp` folder
- Auto-create folders if they don't exist

### Task Execution Principles
- Discuss approach before breaking down complex tasks
- Run example tests after implementation
- Make backups, avoid breaking existing functionality
- Clean up temporary files after completion
- **Operation Logging**: For any session involving 3+ tool calls or file modifications, maintain a running session log

### Operation Log Format

Log file location: `~/.claude/session-logs/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
Auto-create the file and directory if they don't exist. Append entries throughout the session.

```markdown
## Session: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM

### [HH:MM] <Action summary>
- **Tool**: Write / Edit / Bash / WebFetch / etc.
- **Target**: `path/to/file` or `command run`
- **Outcome**: Success / Failed / Partial
- **Notes**: Any important context or decision rationale

### [HH:MM] <Next action>
...
```

Log every: file creation, file edit, bash command with side effects, key decisions. Skip: read-only file reads, web fetches that are purely informational.

### Work Style
- **Task management**: Use TodoWrite to track progress, plan before executing complex tasks, prefer existing skills
- **Communication**: Ask proactively when uncertain, confirm before important operations, follow hook-enforced workflows
- **Code style**: Python follows PEP 8, comments in English, identifiers in English

## Core Workflows

### Research Lifecycle (7 Stages)

```
Ideation → Literature Review → Data & Empirics → Paper Writing → Self-Review → Submission/Rebuttal → Post-Acceptance
```

| Stage | Core Tools | Commands |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| 1. Research Ideation | `research-ideation` skill + `gpt-researcher` skill + `literature-reviewer` agent + Zotero MCP | `/research-init`, `/zotero-review`, `/zotero-notes` |
| 2. Literature Review | `daily-paper-generator` skill + `gpt-researcher` skill + Zotero MCP | `/zotero-notes`, `/zotero-review` |
| 3. Data & Empirical Analysis | `results-analysis` skill + `data-analyst` agent | `/analyze-results` |
| 4. Paper Writing | `social-science-paper-writing` skill + `paper-miner` agent | - |
| 5. Self-Review | `paper-self-review` skill + `academic-paper-reviewer` skill | - |
| 6. Submission & Rebuttal | `review-response` skill + `rebuttal-writer` agent | `/rebuttal` |
| 7. Post-Acceptance | `post-acceptance` skill | `/presentation`, `/poster`, `/promote` |

### Supporting Workflows

- **Automation**: 7 Hooks auto-trigger at session lifecycle stages (skill evaluation, env init, work summary, security check, pre-compact save, post-compact restore)
- **Context Survival**: `pre-compact.py` saves state before context compression; `post-compact-restore.py` restores context on resume — plans and decisions survive session boundaries
- **Quality Gates**: All paper/analysis work scored 0-100; commit requires ≥80, journal submission requires ≥90 (`quality-gates.md` rule)
- **Adversarial QA**: Critic+Fixer loop on papers and analysis (max 5 rounds) before committing — `orchestrator-protocol.md` rule
- **Contractor Mode**: Plan → Approve → Autonomous execution loop; requirements spec (MUST/SHOULD/MAY) for complex tasks
- **Single-Source-of-Truth**: `.tex` is authoritative for papers; Stata `.do` is authoritative during Python transition; `data/raw/` is read-only (`single-source-of-truth.md` rule)
- **Continuous Learning**: `[LEARN:category]` tags written to MEMORY.md whenever corrected or a non-obvious pattern is confirmed; read at session start for complex tasks (`learn.md` rule)
- **Zotero Integration**: Automated paper import, collection management, full-text reading, and citation export via Zotero MCP
- **Daily Paper Tracking**: `daily-paper-generator` monitors NBER WP + arXiv econ + top journal TOCs (AER/QJE/JPE/APSR/AJPS/JOP/CPS/JPubE)
- **Web Background Research**: `gpt-researcher` skill for grey literature, policy documents, institutional context, and case backgrounds (complements Zotero for non-paywalled sources)
- **Research Version Control**: Git + DVC for data/analysis/paper versioning; `git-workflow` skill covers research-specific commit scopes (`data`, `analysis`, `results`, `paper`) and branch strategy
- **Replication Package**: `replication-package` skill prepares AER/APSR-compliant replication materials for journal submission
- **Operation Logging**: All sessions with significant actions logged to `~/.claude/session-logs/YYYY-MM-DD.md` — each file edit, bash command, and key decision recorded with timestamp and outcome
- **Skill Evolution**: `skill-development` → `skill-quality-reviewer` → `skill-improver` three-step improvement loop

## Continuous Learning

**MEMORY.md** accumulates patterns across sessions at `~/.claude/projects/-Users-xuhaiping-Desktop/memory/MEMORY.md`.

Format:
```
[LEARN:category] <what was discovered or corrected> → <correct behavior or when to apply>
```

Categories: `workflow`, `writing`, `python`, `stata`, `data`, `rules`, `skills`, `identity`

Write an entry when: the user corrects an assumption, a pattern is confirmed across 2+ interactions, a non-obvious dependency is discovered, or the user explicitly asks to remember something.

At session end: scan for corrections → write `[LEARN]` entries → check `CLAUDE.zh-CN.md` is in sync.

---

## Naming Conventions

### Skill Naming
- Format: kebab-case (lowercase + hyphens)
- Form: prefer gerund form (verb+ing)
- Example: `scientific-writing`, `git-workflow`, `bug-detective`

### Tags Naming
- Format: Title Case
- Abbreviations all caps: TDD, RLHF, NeurIPS, ICLR
- Example: `[Writing, Research, Academic]`

### Description Standards
- Person: third person
- Content: include purpose and use cases
- Example: "Provides guidance for academic paper writing, covering top-venue submission requirements"
