This file is the living memory for Claude Code sessions on this project.
Update it continuously as decisions are made, experiments are run, and milestones are reached.
It will serve as a primary source for the university post-project documentation report.

## Assistant Operating Baseline

- Follow repository-local instructions in `AGENTS.md` as the primary operating policy.
- Keep experiment reporting reproducible by anchoring claims to notebook outputs and files under `results/`.
- Archive each full pipeline analysis using naming: `analysis_nb<NN>_<env>_<date>.md` (env: `local_cpu`, `local_gpu`, `kaggle_gpu`).

## Architecture Decisions

### ADR-001 — Primary Model: MarBERTv2
- **Date**: February 2026
- **Decision**: Use `UBC-NLP/MARBERTv2` as the primary encoder
- **Rationale**: Best-in-class for Egyptian colloquial Arabic; pretrained on Twitter (dialect-heavy, noisy); validated Feb 2025 benchmarks show 64–85% F1 on Egyptian classification tasks; low compute cost vs ByT5
- **Alternatives considered**: CAMeLBERT (good but MSA-biased), AraBERTv2 (MSA-only), ByT5 (excellent noise handling but high compute)
- **Reference**: `docs/model_recommendation.md`
- **Status**: Accepted

### ADR-002 — Classification Strategy: Multi-Head, Start with L1
- **Date**: February 2026
- **Decision**: Train separate classification heads for L1 (6 classes), L2 (16 classes), L3 (48 classes), and priority (5 classes). Prioritize L1 first, then extend using the same pipeline structure.
- **Rationale**: Flat multiclass gets sparse at deeper levels after deduplication. Hierarchical modeling mirrors ITSM routing logic and keeps interpretation clean.
- **Status**: Accepted

### ADR-003 — Framework: HuggingFace Transformers + PyTorch
- **Date**: February 2026
- **Decision**: Use `transformers` + `torch` with `Trainer` API for fine-tuning
- **Rationale**: Native support for MarBERTv2; standard in academic NLP work; easy to export to ONNX/TorchScript for deployment
- **Status**: Accepted

### ADR-004 — Data Split: Stratified 70/15/15
- **Date**: February 2026
- **Decision**: Stratified split on L1 label — 70% train, 15% validation, 15% test
- **Rationale**: Maintains class distribution across splits; 1,500 test samples sufficient for reliable metric estimation; validation set sized for hyperparameter search
- **Status**: Accepted

### ADR-005 — Dataset Deduplication Applied in Preprocessing, Not at Source
- **Date**: February 2026
- **Decision**: Remove 451 exact duplicate (title_ar, description_ar) pairs during preprocessing in Notebook 02, not by modifying the source dataset CSV on GitHub/HuggingFace.
- **Rationale**: Duplicates create data leakage when identical texts land in both train and test splits, artificially inflating all metrics. Fixing in preprocessing rather than at source preserves the raw dataset as a stable, citable artefact while keeping the transformation explicit and reproducible. This is standard ML practice and must be documented in the methodology chapter of the thesis.
- **What was NOT changed**: The source dataset (`bazokhan/arabic-itsm-dataset`) is unchanged. The L2 (16 classes) and L3 (48 classes) counts were found to be correct — the dataset README had the wrong numbers (14/31). The README of the dataset repo should be updated to reflect the true counts.
- **Impact**: Post-dedup dataset size is ~9,549 tickets (down from 10,000). Train/val/test splits are recomputed from the deduplicated base.
- **Status**: Accepted — applied in Notebook 02 cell `162d9cc6`

### ADR-006 — PyTorch Installation Must Specify CUDA Wheel Explicitly
- **Date**: February 2026
- **Decision**: Do not use bare `pip install torch`. Always install via the PyTorch CUDA index URL: `pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121`
- **Rationale**: Bare `pip install torch` on Windows silently installs the CPU-only wheel (`torch 2.x+cpu`). This caused a complete training failure in EXP-002 — `torch.cuda.is_available()` returned `False` despite a functional RTX 3050 GPU being present. The error is silent and the model trains for hours on CPU before the failure is detectable.
- **Consequences**: `requirements.txt` now contains a comment block instead of a bare `torch` entry. All new environment setups must follow the two-step procedure: (1) update NVIDIA driver ≥550, (2) install CUDA wheel.
- **Status**: Accepted

### ADR-007 — Storage-Aware Model Retention Policy
- **Date**: February 2026
- **Decision**: Keep only academically significant checkpoints, not every run. Always preserve at least:
  - last failed diagnostic model (if it explains a major issue),
  - best validated checkpoint per experiment stage,
  - final deployment candidate.
- **Rationale**: Balances reproducibility and thesis traceability with limited local storage on personal hardware.
- **Operational rule**: Compress/archive older intermediate checkpoints and keep metrics/config snapshots even when raw weights are removed.
- **Status**: Accepted

### ADR-008 — Statistical Significance Is Required for Final Claims
- **Date**: February 2026
- **Decision**: Add a dedicated statistical testing stage (bootstrap confidence intervals + McNemar test) before asserting superiority over best baseline.
- **Rationale**: Run-002 improvements are real but moderate; significance and uncertainty must be reported academically.
- **Status**: Accepted

### ADR-009 — Kaggle GPU for L3+ Training (GPU Constraint Rationale)
- **Date**: February 2026
- **Decision**: Use Kaggle free-tier T4 GPU for all training involving L3 heads or more. Local RTX 3050 (4 GB VRAM) handles L1-only and L1+L2 joint training but is not used for L3+ due to time and reliability constraints with the larger task graph.
- **Rationale**: Kaggle provides 2× Tesla T4 (30 GPU hrs/week), sufficient for 10-epoch L3+ runs (~13 min each). Local GPU is reserved for fast iteration (L1, L2). This split also provides a clean environment separation: local = development, Kaggle = production training.
- **Operational rule**: Always push code changes to GitHub before running on Kaggle. Kaggle notebook clones from `main` branch.
- **Status**: Accepted
