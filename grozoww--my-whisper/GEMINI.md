# CLAUDE.md

Working notes for agents and humans on this codebase. `README.md` is what the app is;
`CONTRIBUTING.md` is how to build it. This is what to know before changing it.

## What this app is

A macOS menu bar dictation tool. Hold a hotkey, talk, and the cleaned-up text is pasted into
whatever field had focus. Everything runs on the Mac by default: speech through NVIDIA Parakeet on
the Neural Engine, cleanup through rules plus Apple's on-device model.

Not sandboxed, on purpose — the Accessibility API cannot reach other apps from inside the App
Sandbox, and pasting into another app is the entire product. Distribution is Developer ID plus
notarization, never the Mac App Store.

## The four rules

These are from `CONTRIBUTING.md` and they are not negotiable. Everything below is downstream of
them.

1. **Never commit a secret.** Keys come from the user at runtime and live in the macOS Keychain.
   Nothing in the build, the tests or CI may require a key.
2. **The app works with zero keys.** Local speech and local cleanup are the default path.
3. **No telemetry, ever.** The only unattended network request is the GitHub release check, and it
   sends nothing about the user. See `UpdateChecker` — the test `sendsNothingIdentifying` is what
   keeps that true.
4. **Keep the build warning-free.** CI fails on a warning. The Swift 6 concurrency warnings in the
   audio path are real defects; that code runs on the audio thread.

And one that follows from them:

5. **Audio never leaves the Mac implicitly.** Choosing a language Parakeet cannot handle does not
   quietly start uploading — it fails with a message naming the switch the user has to turn on.
   `TranscriptionRouter` is the only place that decision is made.

## Commands

OURWHISPER_SECTION=modes open -a OurWhisper   # open the window on a given screen
```

`--selftest` exists because the interactive path needs Accessibility permission, which a fresh
clone, a CI runner and an automated agent all lack. **If you are an agent and want to know whether
transcription works, this is the command** — not launching the app.

`OURWHISPER_SECTION` exists for the same reason on the UI side: the window is only reachable by
clicking a menu bar icon, which nothing automated can do. Values are the `NavigationSection` raw
values (`home`, `modes`, `vocabulary`, `configuration`, `sound`, `modelsLibrary`, `history`).

`screenshots.sh` is the third of these. It launches the app with `OURWHISPER_SCREENSHOT=<target>`,
which seeds demo data, poses one screen and prints its window number for `screencapture` — see
`ScreenshotMode`. **If you are an agent and want to see what a screen looks like**, this is the
command, and it is cheaper than the throwaway harness. `OURWHISPER_SCREENSHOT_SIZE=880x560` and
`OURWHISPER_SCREENSHOT_SIDEBAR=collapsed` pose the awkward cases — the window at its minimum, and
the screens whose own list becomes the leftmost thing in the window.

The Xcode project uses **synchronized file groups**: a new file under `Sources/` or `Tests/` joins
its target automatically. Never edit `project.pbxproj` to add a file.

## Things that will catch you out

**Swift's `Codable` ignores property defaults.** A missing key throws — it does not fall back to
the default you wrote in the struct. Every persisted type therefore decodes through the helpers in
`Core/Storage/LenientDecoding.swift`. **If you add a field to `Settings`, `Mode`, `HistoryEntry` or
`VocabularyEntry`, add it to that type's `init(from:)` too.** Forgetting means every existing file
fails to decode, `JSONFileStore` quarantines it, and the user's settings, modes and history revert
on upgrade. `SchemaEvolutionTests` covers this.

**`\b` is ASCII-only.** It matches inside Cyrillic text, so any regex that needs a word boundary
must use the Unicode form in `RuleRefiner.RegexCache.wordRegex`. Russian and Ukrainian are two of
the app's primary languages; getting this wrong corrupts them silently.

**The event tap is fragile in two specific ways.** macOS disables it if a callback is slow, and it
dies silently when Accessibility is revoked. Both are handled in `HotkeyMonitor`; keep callbacks
fast and do not add work to them.

**Capture the paste target before drawing anything.** Showing the pill first lets
`frontmostApplication` change underneath, and the text lands in the wrong app.
`DictationController.beginRecording` gets this order right — do not reorder it.

**The clipboard has to be read before the paste, not after.** `TextInjector` pastes through the
clipboard, so by the time cleanup runs the user's clipboard is already the dictated text.
`DictationController.beginRecording` reads it alongside the paste target, for the same reason, and
it only reads it at all when some mode has "Use the clipboard as context" or "Paste the clipboard
after the text" on — `ModeStore.anyModeReadsClipboard` is that condition, and it is what lets the
README say the clipboard is otherwise only touched to paste. `ClipboardContext` is the single
place that reads it, and it refuses anything marked `org.nspasteboard.ConcealedType`, which is
what a password manager sets on a copied password.

**The two clipboard toggles are opposite treatments of the same text.** Context shows it to the
on-device model, capped at `ClipboardContext.referenceLimit`, with a prompt forbidding the model
from repeating any of it. Paste never shows the model anything and reproduces the clipboard
verbatim after the dictated text — uncapped, because a copied stack trace the app quietly
shortened would be worse than not pasting it. Keep the capping on `ClipboardContext.reference`,
not on the read: the read result is what gets pasted. History records what was dictated, not the
combined paste, so a thirty-day history file never accumulates copies of the user's clipboard.

**The clipboard placeholder is substituted last, and that ordering is the whole design.**
`ClipboardContext.substituted` runs after rules *and* after the model, because the one thing the
model must never see is the text it is about to reproduce — it rewords a stack trace, and
`OnDeviceRefiner.sanityChecked` then throws the answer away for growing past 1.6×.

**The model marks the spot; the rule fills it.** The placeholder is *spoken*, so it never arrives
as the phrase the mode has on file: the recogniser writes "clipboard contents", the case ending
changes in Russian, and the model rewords what is left. Matching it as text was always going to
miss. So the model is asked, in `OnDeviceRefiner.prompt`, to put `ClipboardContext.marker` where
the user asked for the clipboard — the judgement is the model's, the output is a literal, and the
clipboard itself is still never shown. Ask for a character offset instead and you get a number a
small model guessed at, four out, splitting a word.

Three things hold that together. It is only *asked for* when `ClipboardContext.mentioned` says the
transcript names the clipboard at all — the model decides where, never whether, or a sentence that
never mentioned it gets the clipboard dropped into the middle of it. When no marker comes back —
model off, mode with no instructions, model ignored the request — the spoken phrase is matched
with `RuleRefiner.cachedInflectedRegex(for:)`, which allows each word three letters of ending, and
a hand-rolled `\b` here would fire inside Cyrillic. And a marker with no clipboard behind it is
taken back out by `removingMarker`, punctuation and all, rather than pasted as `[[CLIPBOARD]]`.

Escape the clipboard with `NSRegularExpression.escapedTemplate(for:)` on the regex path, or a
copied `$1` becomes a capture reference. The marker path is a plain string replacement and needs
no escaping — which is one more reason to prefer it.

**"Is there a text field here?" can only be answered in one direction.** A frontmost app with no
caret swallows the synthetic ⌘V without a word, and the restore 220 ms later puts the user's old
clipboard back over the text — which is how a dictation into a Finder window used to disappear
behind a green tick and the word "Finder". `TextInjector.focusedElementAcceptsText` asks the
focused Accessibility element whether `kAXSelectedText` is settable, and that answer is acted on
only when it is *no*: the paste is still posted, and all that changes is that the clipboard is not
restored. Gating the ⌘V on a *yes* would break dictation everywhere it matters most — Chromium and
Electron expose one `AXWebArea` for a whole page rather than an element per input, which is also
why `AXWebArea` is in `textRoles`. The check runs at inject time and not in `captureTarget`,
because that runs inside the event tap callback and a round trip to another process there is
exactly what makes macOS switch the tap off.

**The pill must never take keyboard focus.** It is a `nonactivatingPanel` with
`canBecomeKey == false`. If it took focus there would be nothing left to paste into.

**A menu bar image has to be a template, and nothing tells you when it is not.** The idle glyph is
the app's own frog from `MenuBarIcon.imageset`, and the `template-rendering-intent` in its
`Contents.json` is what lets macOS throw the colours away and paint the shape to match the bar it
lands in. Without it the artwork ships as literal black pixels, which look right in every
screenshot taken on a light menu bar and disappear on a dark one — and the menu bar follows the
desktop picture, not the appearance setting, so "it works in Light Mode" proves nothing. Drawing a
light copy and a dark copy instead has the same fault with more files. `AppBundleTests` checks the
flag survived, because a template that stopped being one still renders.

The size is the other half: `MenuBarExtra` hands its label straight to the status item, which does
not resize it. 18 points is what a status item is given, so artwork of any other size arrives at
that size — and `.resizable()` on the label stretches the template to whatever the bar allows.

**Signing is tied to Accessibility permission.** macOS records the grant against the *designated
requirement* of the signature, not against the app's bytes or its name. An ad-hoc signature's
requirement is `cdhash H"…"` — one exact binary — so every rebuild and every release is a new app
that has been granted nothing, and the old entry stays in System Settings looking ticked while
applying to nothing. Signing with a certificate makes the requirement
`identifier "com.grozoww.ourwhisper" and certificate leaf = H"…"`, which any later build signed by
the same certificate satisfies. `./scripts/dev-cert.sh` does this for your rebuilds and
`./scripts/release-cert.sh` for public releases; the certificates are self-signed, and Apple is
not involved in either. Read "The signing trap" in `CONTRIBUTING.md` before debugging "dictation
stopped working after a rebuild". Losing the release key is not recoverable — every user re-grants
Accessibility once.

**A programmatically created `NSWindow` releases itself on `close()`.** ARC then releases it again
and the process dies. `Tests/ViewRenderingTests.swift` sets `isReleasedWhenClosed = false`.

**Unit tests use the app as their test host, so the app really launches.** `AppState.start()`
returns early under XCTest — otherwise every test run would begin a 600 MB model download and
install a system-wide event tap.

**Stores default to the real Application Support directory.** Every store takes a `directory:`
parameter for exactly one reason: a test that used the default would destroy the settings, modes,
vocabulary and history of whoever ran the suite. Use `TemporaryDirectory` from `Tests/TestSupport`.
`AppDirectories.support` also redirects to a temporary directory under XCTest as a backstop —
that backstop exists because this mistake was made once and silently rewrote real user data.

**Accessibility is granted per app bundle at a path.** A second clone or a git worktree produces a
second `OurWhisper.app` in a different DerivedData directory, and a permission granted to one does
not apply to the other — while System Settings still shows a ticked OurWhisper. This presents as
"I granted it and the app still says I did not". The Home screen shows the running bundle path and
warns when other builds exist; check that before suspecting the permission code.

**Padding a `Section` pads every row in it.** In a `List`, `Section { rows }.padding(.top, 10)`
does not put 10pt above the group — it puts 10pt above each row inside it, so the rows come out
taller than the rows in the group above and their selection highlights come out taller with them.
The sidebar shipped that way. The gap between groups is the section break itself; there is nothing
to add.

**A pane whose content cannot shrink is laid out past the window edge, and then clipped.** Two
shapes of this. `HSplitView` sizes each pane to its content's ideal width, so a detail pane with a
wide row overflows the window with no scroll bar and no reflow — `ModesView` and `HistoryView` both
use a plain `HStack` with an explicit list width for that reason. And a row whose text column has
no minimum width loses the negotiation entirely: `SettingsRow` used to let its label shrink to
nothing, which turned "Symbol" into one letter per line in a narrow mode editor. It now measures
in `SettingsRowLayout` and drops the control onto its own line instead. The window's `minWidth` is the
other half of that: it is set to what the widest screen actually needs, and lowering it puts the
squeeze back.

**A window sized to its content view does not resize when the content does.** The pill's phases
are different widths — "Cleaning up" is wider than five audio bars — so setting `PillModel.phase`
directly leaves the panel at the previous width and the longer label is truncated and off centre.
Go through `PillWindowController.setPhase`, which re-fits and re-centres. `show()` also resets the
model, so it must be called *before* the phase is set, not after.

**A window clips its own contents, shadow included.** The pill's panel is sized to the SwiftUI
view, and the window server clips to the window frame, so a `.shadow` with nowhere to fall is cut
off square — the pill then appears to sit inside a translucent grey rectangle. `PillView` reserves
`shadowMargin` of transparent padding for it, and `PillWindowController.reposition` subtracts that
margin so the capsule stays where it was. Any floating overlay that draws its own shadow needs the
same room.

**The version number is derived, so it needs real history.** `scripts/version.sh` sets the patch
number from the pull requests merged since the `VERSION` file last changed, which means a shallow
clone — `actions/checkout`'s default — has no merges to count and every build comes out as x.y.0.
Both workflows pass `fetch-depth: 0` for that reason. Major and minor stay a hand edit to
`VERSION`; a `v*` tag on the built commit overrides the lot. `package.sh` stamps the result onto
`xcodebuild`, so `MARKETING_VERSION` in the project is only what a plain Xcode build falls back to
— keep it equal to `VERSION`, but do not treat it as the source of truth. Getting this wrong ships
an app that reports an older version than the release it came from, and `UpdateChecker` then
offers every user an update to what they are already running.

**A settings screen is built eagerly unless you say otherwise.** `SettingsPage` puts its sections
in a `LazyVStack`, not a `VStack`, so opening a screen builds only what is on display. A `Picker` is
about 6 ms to build and Configuration has seven of them; building the whole page up front is what
made switching sidebar rows take ~240 ms before anything appeared, against ~135 ms now. The rest of
that is SwiftUI tearing down one screen and building the next, which is what a `switch` in
`RootView.detail` means — measure before assuming one screen is at fault.

**`ViewThatFits` builds every candidate, and a settings page is one view.** Both halves matter
together. `SettingsRow` used to state its two arrangements as `ViewThatFits { sideBySide;
stacked }`, which is the clearest way to write it and meant every row built two copies of its
control — a `Picker` is expensive to build. And because a whole settings screen is a single
SwiftUI view reading one observed `Settings` value, flipping any switch re-renders every row on
it. Measured: 105 ms per change on Configuration, which is a toggle animating at about five
frames a second. `SettingsRowLayout` measures each subview once instead, and the same change now
costs 23 ms — one `dimensions(in:)` call per subview, which already carries the size, rather than
that *and* `sizeThatFits` for the same proposal.

If a screen ever feels slow again, measure it in the real app rather than in a test. `AppState.start`
returns early under XCTest, so a test host never runs the event tap, the model load or the permission
poll, and it reported roughly half the cost the shipped app actually pays. Add a temporary probe
behind an environment variable that changes state and waits for `CFRunLoopActivity.beforeWaiting`,
then run `sample` against the process while it churns. Release is not faster than Debug here — that
was measured — so a slow screen is a real defect, not a build-configuration artefact.

**Nothing in a SwiftUI body may ask the system a question — and a `@State` default is in the
body.** `LaunchAtLogin.status` is an XPC round trip to the background task daemon (~3 ms) and
`KeychainStore.has` is one to securityd; both were being read from `body`, where they ran several
times per render. Read them into `@State` on appear and refresh them when something changes them.
The same goes for `AudioDevices.inputs()`, which costs ~65 ms — `SoundView` already loads it in a
`.task`, and `AppState.inputDeviceName` only calls it when the user has pinned a device.

The half of that rule which is easy to miss is `@State private var status = LaunchAtLogin.status`.
A property's default is an ordinary expression, evaluated every time the struct is built even
though SwiftUI keeps only the first result — and a settings screen is one view, so it is rebuilt
whenever anything on it changes. That one line was 94% of the time spent evaluating
`ConfigurationView.body`, and it is why flipping a switch cost 19 ms rather than 10. Give `@State` a
cheap literal and fill it in from `.onAppear` or `.task`.

Polling counts too. `PermissionsManager` used to read `AVCaptureDevice.authorizationStatus` — about
13 ms on the main thread — every two seconds for the life of the process. Accessibility is the one
that has to be polled, because macOS never says it changed; the microphone can only change in
System Settings, so it is re-read when the app is activated instead. And because `@Observable`
publishes a write whether or not the value changed, a poll that writes the same answer back
invalidates every view watching it: compare before assigning.

**`SMAppService` reports `.notFound` for an app that has simply never registered.** It does not
mean the app is in the wrong place. The login-item switch used to disable itself on that status
and tell the user to move the app to /Applications, which left it greyed out on a correctly
installed copy; registering from `.notFound` works, and only `.requiresApproval` is a state code
cannot get out of. A self-signed app with no Team ID registers fine — verified by registering and
unregistering one.

**Bringing a window forward is not the same as wanting a Dock icon.** `WindowPresenter.activate`
used to set `.regular` unconditionally, so the app appeared in the Dock for as long as its window
was open no matter what "Show in the Dock" said — and the switch read as broken rather than as the
preference it is. An accessory app can hold a key window, take keyboard input, and run its menu
key equivalents (⌘W, ⌘Q, ⌘V in a text field all work — verified) without a Dock icon; it only has
to be told to activate. What it does *not* get is the menu bar at the top of the screen, which
keeps showing whichever regular app was in front. That is the whole cost of the toggle being off.

**Launch at login is not a setting.** `LaunchAtLogin` reads `SMAppService.mainApp.status` every
time. Persisting it in `Settings` would create a second source of truth that drifts the moment
someone switches the login item off in System Settings, and the toggle would then lie about what
the Mac will actually do at the next login. Registration is also per bundle path, so a debug build
registers the copy in DerivedData — the same trap as Accessibility permission, below.

**`decodeIfPresent` cannot tell "absent" from "null".** For an optional field whose default is not
nil — `pushToTalkChord` is the live example — use
`container.optional(key, defaultWhenAbsent:)`, or upgrading users get nil instead of the new
default and the feature silently arrives switched off.

## Adding things

**A new transcription engine.** Conform to `TranscriptionProvider`, take an `HTTPClient` if it is
a cloud engine, and add it to `TranscriptionRouter`. Do not add a second *local* speech model
without benchmark numbers — the Parakeet-over-Whisper choice is documented in `README.md` with
FLEURS WER, and `CONTRIBUTING.md` requires evidence to change it.

**A cleanup rule.** Add it to `CleanupOptions`, implement it in `RuleRefiner`, wire the toggle into
`ModesView`, and add it to `Mode`'s `init(from:)`. Rules must be pure and fast: they run on every
dictation, including when the model is off. Anything needing judgement belongs in
`OnDeviceRefiner` instead.

**A setting.** Add the field with a default, add it to its section's `init(from:)`, and surface it
in the right screen. Never add a control without the sentence explaining it — `SettingsRow`
requires a `detail` for that reason.

**Anything users download.** `scripts/package.sh` builds the DMG and `scripts/install.sh` is the
`curl | bash` that installs it. There is no Apple Developer account behind this project, so
releases are signed with the self-signed `OurWhisper Release` certificate rather than notarized,
and macOS refuses to open them until the quarantine flag is cleared — which is the one thing
install.sh exists to do. Signing and notarizing are deliberately separate decisions in both
`package.sh` and the workflow: a self-signed certificate cannot be notarized, but it is what keeps
the Accessibility grant alive across updates, and treating the two as one flag is what made every
release ad-hoc. The same mistake one level up is what broke the update check: every release was
marked a prerelease because none was notarized, `/releases/latest` skips prereleases, and the app
read the resulting 404 as "up to date". Notarization decides whether Gatekeeper complains, not
whether a release is finished — merging to main is what decides that.

**Merging to main publishes a finished release, and it becomes the latest.** A pull request builds
and tests but does not package; a push to main packages and publishes, tagged
`release-<version>-<short sha>` so nothing is ever replaced; a `v*` tag does the same under its own
tag. Only a `workflow_dispatch` rehearsal is a prerelease, because that is a build nobody merged.
Every one of them is *named* `release-<version>-<short sha>`. Marking the main builds prereleases
is what kept the update check silent for the project's whole life: `UpdateChecker` skips
prereleases, no `v*` tag was ever cut, and so there was never anything for it to find.

The other half of that failure was in the tag itself. `UpdateChecker.normalise` stripped a leading
`v` and nothing else, so `release-1.0.8-71f957b` came out with a word in front of the numbers and
compared as 0.0.0 — the newest release read as older than whatever the user was already running.
It now takes the first run of dot-separated digits, and requires the dot so `build-7` does not read
as version 7. **A tag shape that carries the version must survive `normalise`**; if you change how
releases are tagged, change that with it.

**GitHub does not return the releases list newest first.** `GET /releases` came back with `v1.0.8`
ahead of 1.0.9, 1.0.10 and 1.0.7 — an order matching neither `id`, `created_at` nor `published_at`,
and GitHub documents no order at all. `install.sh` took the first DMG in that response, so
`curl | bash` installed 1.0.8 while `/releases/latest` correctly pointed at 1.0.10. It now asks
`/releases/latest` first and, only if that 404s, reads the version out of each DMG's *filename* and
takes the highest with `sort -V`. **Never read a GitHub releases list positionally.** And the same
mistake in miniature: plain `sort` puts 1.0.9 above 1.0.10, so the `-V` is not decoration.

That rule has two callers, and fixing one of them is what let this run for four more releases.
`UpdateChecker.newestFinishedRelease` took the first *finished* entry in the same list, on the same
false belief, written down in its own doc comment as "GitHub returns them newest first". The list
put `release-1.0.9-38ea901` ahead of 1.0.12, 1.0.11 and 1.0.10, so an app on 1.0.11 was told 1.0.9
was the newest, found it was not newer, and reported itself up to date — silently, and looking
perfectly healthy while doing it. It now takes the highest parsed version out of the whole list.
**Parse every entry's version and take the maximum; never trust a position.** Both callers, every
time.

The test is the other half of why it survived. `picksNewestFinishedRelease` was called "the newest
finished release in the list is the one offered" and its fixture was sorted newest first, so it
passed identically whether the code sorted or took element zero. **A fixture for an
order-independence claim must be out of order**, or it asserts nothing. `ignoresTheOrderGitHubReturns`
now uses the real response verbatim.

The checksum had the matching bug. `SHA256SUMS` was found by its own separate search over the same
response, so it could come from a different release than the DMG — and then the filename lookup
found nothing, `EXPECTED` came out empty, and the check was skipped in silence. It is now derived
from the DMG's own URL, and both skip paths say so out loud, because a check that quietly does
nothing reads exactly like one that passed.

The DMG is checked where it ships, not on the branch. `package.sh` exits zero on an image that is
subtly wrong — an asset catalog that failed to compile leaves the app with no icon — so
`release.yml` mounts the image and checks the app, the icon and the signature *before* Publish. A
failure there means no release is created, rather than one `UpdateChecker` goes on to offer people.
Packaging on every pull request checked a DMG nobody would download and cost five macOS minutes a
run; this replaces it.

**A dependency.** It must be pinned to an exact version, `Package.resolved` must be committed in
the same change, and `./scripts/audit-deps.sh` must pass. Two traps found the hard way, both
recorded in `CONTRIBUTING.md`: a package with a build-tool plugin needs Xcode's plugin trust, and
anything depending on `mlx-swift` 0.31.5+ needs Xcode's separately-downloaded Metal toolchain.

## Testing

Swift Testing, not XCTest. 157 tests, no network, no API key, no microphone, no permissions.

- Cloud providers are tested against `StubHTTPClient` with recorded response shapes.
- Every screen is built and laid out in `ViewRenderingTests` — a view that crashes on
  construction compiles fine and fails the first time someone clicks that sidebar row.
- The rule refiner has the deepest coverage because it is pure and it touches every dictation.

What is *not* covered, and why: the event tap, the paste path and CoreAudio device selection all
need permissions and real hardware. For those, `CONTRIBUTING.md` asks which apps you tested pasting
into, and that stays a human answer.

## Style

Match the surrounding code. Specifically:

- Comments explain **why**, not what. If a line needs a comment saying what it does, rename
  something instead. Existing comments are the model — they document trade-offs, traps and
  decisions, not mechanics.
- Types get a doc comment saying what they are for and what the non-obvious constraint is.
- Prefer the plain word. The codebase says "loudness" rather than "amplitude envelope".
- User-facing strings say what to do about it. "Add a Soniox API key in Configuration", not
  "unauthorized".
