# OpenCode UI

This repo is a standalone VS Code extension for browsing and operating OpenCode sessions per workspace folder. It starts `opencode serve` for each workspace, shows grouped sessions in the Activity Bar sidebar, and opens session tabs with a local webview UI. The local `opencode/` directory is only a symlink to the upstream repo for reference; do not import from it, depend on it at runtime, or commit it.

- `src/`: extension source code
  - `src/core/`: workspace runtime, SDK access, commands, event streaming, session state, and tab orchestration
  - `src/sidebar/`: TreeDataProvider, tree items, focused session tracking, and sidebar webviews
  - `src/panel/`: session panel provider, serializer, host-side controller logic, and webview HTML shell
  - `src/bridge/`: typed host/webview message contracts and panel constants
- `images/`: extension icons and activity bar assets
- `dist/`: compiled extension and webview bundle output
- `PLAN.md`: implementation plan and milestone tracking
- `AGENTS.md`: instructions for agentic coding agents in this repository
- `.memory/`: local memory log, git ignored
- `opencode/`: local upstream symlink for reference only, git ignored

## MOST IMPORTANT RULES

- DO NOT modify AGENTS.md unless the user permits it by explicitly asking you to do so.
- When you adding new feature or fixing a bug, please consider about how to minimize the impact on the existing code, which means modify codes as less as possible.
- When you want to ask user for making decisions, if there is a `question` tool or `ask_user` tool, prefer to use it instead of asking the user directly. If there is no suitable tool, ask the user directly.
- Before making any changes, write a TODO list to remind yourself to implement the features later, if there is a `todo` tool, prefer to use it instead of writing the TODO list manually.
- Before you start writing code, you need to inform the user of the solution you intend to adopt. Only after discussing and confirming with the user should you begin the work. And also remember that DO NOT ASK ANY QUESTIONS IN SUBAGENTS.

## Run / Build / Lint / Test

- Package manager: `bun` (`packageManager: bun@1.3.10`).
- Install dependencies: `bun install`.
- Main development validation: `bun run check-types && bun run lint && bun run compile`.
- Type-check only: `bun run check-types`.
- Lint only: `bun run lint`.
- Development build: `bun run compile`.
- Production package build: `bun run package`.
- Prepublish hook: `bun run vscode:prepublish`.
- Watch esbuild bundle: `bun run watch:esbuild`.
- Watch TypeScript only: `bun run watch:tsc`.
- Current test command: `bun run test`.
- Default test scope: `bun run test` runs `bun test ./src/panel ./src/test` so only this extension's local tests run, not the upstream `opencode/` symlink tree.
- Current single-test support: `bun test path/to/file.test.ts`.
- Test placement convention:
  - Keep module-local unit tests next to the code they cover, such as `src/panel/**/foo.test.ts`.
  - Put cross-module, integration-style, and parity tests under `src/test/`.
  - Do not add new tests under the local `opencode/` symlink.
- Build pipeline details from `package.json`:
  - `compile`: runs type-check, lint, then `node esbuild.js`
  - `package`: runs type-check, lint, then `node esbuild.js --production`
- Prefer validating code changes before handing work back, especially for edits under `src/core/`, `src/panel/`, `src/sidebar/`, or `src/bridge/`.
- No Cursor rules were found in `.cursor/rules/` or `.cursorrules` as of this file update.
- No Copilot rules were found in `.github/copilot-instructions.md` as of this file update.
- Do not run repo workflow commands against the local `opencode/` symlink.

## Code Style

- Language and toolchain:
  - The repo is TypeScript-first with React TSX for webviews and CSS for styling.
  - `tsconfig.json` uses `strict: true`, `module: Node16`, `moduleResolution: Node16`, `target: ES2022`, and `jsx: react-jsx`.
  - Preserve strict typing; do not weaken types with `any`, broad casts, or untyped message payloads.
- Imports:
  - Keep imports simple: external modules first, then local relative imports.
  - Use `import * as vscode from "vscode"` for VS Code APIs.
  - Use `import type` for type-only imports when possible.
  - Prefer short relative paths that match the existing folder structure; do not introduce alias systems casually.
- Formatting:
  - Match the existing style: double quotes, semicolons omitted, and 2-space indentation.
  - Prefer small functions, early returns, and lightweight helpers over deep nesting.
  - Keep lines readable; extract helpers instead of piling on conditional branches.
  - Add comments only when a block is not obvious from surrounding code.
- Naming:
  - Classes, React components, and exported types use PascalCase.
  - Functions, methods, variables, fields, and hooks use camelCase.
  - Keep command ids, view ids, and panel ids in the existing `opencode-ui.*` namespace.
  - Reuse domain names already established in the repo such as `mgr`, `rt`, `dir`, `sessionId`, `workspaceName`, `panel`, and `snapshot`.
- Types and contracts:
  - Keep host/webview protocol changes synchronized across `src/bridge/types.ts`, panel host code, and webview consumers.
  - Define explicit message shapes and prefer discriminated unions for host/webview traffic and runtime events.
  - Keep SDK-facing shapes centralized in `src/core/sdk.ts` when extending OpenCode API data.
  - Avoid optional state that can be derived cheaply; compute derived values in helpers/selectors where practical.
- Error handling:
  - Prefer early guards for missing workspace folders, runtime state, SDK availability, panel state, or session data.
  - Convert unknown errors into readable strings before showing them to users.
  - User-facing failures should usually go through `vscode.window.showErrorMessage` or `vscode.window.showInformationMessage`.
  - Operational details and recovery notes should also be written to the `OpenCode UI` output channel when helpful.
  - Keep reconnection, refresh, and fallback paths explicit in runtime and event-stream code.
- VS Code extension structure:
  - Keep extension activation, server lifecycle, SDK access, event streaming, and session orchestration in `src/core/`.
  - Keep sidebar rendering and tree concerns in `src/sidebar/`.
  - Keep session panel host lifecycle, reducer/controller logic, and serializer behavior in `src/panel/`.
  - Keep bridge contracts in `src/bridge/`; do not scatter duplicated message types across the repo.
- Webview and UI rules:
  - Keep the local webview implementation independent from the upstream `opencode/` codebase.
  - You may study the symlinked upstream repo for ideas, but do not import from it or copy large subsystems wholesale.
  - Favor incremental UI changes that preserve current behavior, visual semantics, and host/webview protocol meaning.
  - Keep CSS split by concern and place new selectors in the closest existing stylesheet instead of creating overlapping rule sets.
- Session and workspace behavior:
  - Always preserve the `dir` dimension; this extension is designed around per-workspace runtimes.
  - Keep one session panel per `dir + sessionId`.
  - When calling workspace-scoped session APIs, pass `directory: rt.dir` explicitly.
  - Avoid changes that blur responsibilities between runtime management, session state, sidebar state, and panel state.
- React and state patterns:
  - Follow existing functional component and hook patterns in `src/panel/webview/` and `src/sidebar/webview/`.
  - Keep local state minimal and derive display state from snapshots where possible.
  - Prefer passing typed callbacks and small props objects over loose bags of optional values.
- Lint-driven conventions and hygiene:
  - Unused parameters that must exist should be prefixed with `_` to satisfy ESLint.
  - Do not leave dead locals, stale imports, or commented-out code behind.
  - Avoid unrelated file churn during focused refactors or bug fixes.
  - Never commit `opencode/` or `.memory/`.
  - Treat `PLAN.md` as the source of truth for milestone status and architectural constraints.
  - If you change workflow assumptions or repo commands, update this file accordingly.

## Git Commit Message Style

The git commit message style should be composed of two parts: title and body. The title should be `<type>: <subject>` (such as `feat: add new feature` or `fix: fix bug`). The body should be the detailed description of the changes in list format.

It's important that DO NOT include any symbol like $ or ` in the title or body. This would cause the bash shell to interpret the title or body as a command or a code block.
