## Project Overview

Frank Sherlock is a local-only, AI-powered image cataloging and search system. The main application lives in `sherlock/` — a Tauri v2 desktop app with a Rust backend and React frontend. Everything else in this repo is research and prototyping that informed the final design.

## Repository Layout

```
sherlock/               <- THE MAIN APP (Tauri v2 desktop)
  desktop/
    src-tauri/          <- Rust backend (scan, classify, thumbnail, db, config)
    src/                <- React frontend (VSCode-inspired UI)
_classification/        <- PoC: Python classification pipeline (informed classify.rs)
_research_ab_test/      <- A/B benchmark research (scripts, docs, test files)
  scripts/              <- Benchmark scripts for model selection
  docs/                 <- Research notes: IDEA.md, IDEA2.md, RESULTS.md
  lib/                  <- Shared Python helpers
  test_files/           <- Test corpus (gitignored, not shipped)
  results/              <- Generated benchmark outputs (gitignored)
scripts/                <- Build scripts (build-local.sh)
docs/                   <- App assets (app_icon.png)
.github/workflows/      <- CI/CD (release.yml, ci.yml)
```

## Tech Stack (Main App)

- **Desktop**: Tauri v2.10+ (Rust + WebView)
- **Backend**: Rust (rusqlite, ureq, image, base64, regex, sha2, walkdir)
- **Frontend**: React + Vite + TypeScript
- **AI**: Ollama (qwen2.5vl:7b) for vision classification, Surya OCR in isolated Python venv
- **Database**: SQLite + FTS5 in `~/.local/share/frank_sherlock/db/`
- **Target OS**: Linux (AppImage), macOS (DMG), Windows (MSI)

## Build & Test

From `sherlock/desktop/`:

```bash
npm install                    # frontend deps
cargo build                    # rust backend (from src-tauri/)
cargo test                     # 322 unit tests
npm run tauri:dev              # launch dev mode
npm run test                   # 299 frontend tests
npm run tauri:build            # produce AppImage/DMG/MSI
```

If Wayland/NVIDIA causes WebKit issues:
```bash
WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER=1 GDK_BACKEND=wayland,x11 npm run tauri:dev
```

## Key Rust Modules

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `classify.rs` | Ollama vision LLM pipeline: primary classification (3-attempt + regex salvage), anime enrichment, Surya OCR + LLM fallback, document/receipt extraction |
| `face.rs` | Native ONNX face detection (SCRFD) and recognition (ArcFace), 512-dim embeddings, cosine clustering, person management |
| `thumbnail.rs` | 300px JPEG thumbnails, Lanczos3, skip-if-exists, GIF first-frame |
| `scan.rs` | Two-phase incremental scan: metadata-only discovery (zero reads for unchanged), classification + thumbnail processing, move detection, cache cleanup, cooperative cancellation |
| `db.rs` | SQLite + FTS5, scan job checkpointing, upsert/move/delete operations |
| `config.rs` | AppPaths resolution, directory creation |
| `lib.rs` | Tauri commands, scan worker spawning, setup/download flow, auto-cleanup, scan cancellation |
| `query_parser.rs` | Natural language query parsing (media type, dates, confidence) |
| `runtime.rs` | Ollama/nvidia-smi status gathering |
| `platform/` | OS abstraction: clipboard, GPU detection, Python venv paths, executable lookup |

## Architecture Principles

- **Read-only**: Never writes to scanned directories. All data goes to `~/.local/share/frank_sherlock/`.
- **Incremental**: Unchanged files (same mtime + size) skip fingerprinting and classification entirely — only a scan marker update.
- **Move-aware**: Renamed/moved files detected by fingerprint, preserving all classification data.
- **Resilient**: Scan jobs checkpoint after each file. Interrupted scans resume from last cursor.
- **Local-only**: No cloud APIs. Ollama runs locally, Surya OCR runs in an isolated venv.
- **Multi-OS**: All features must work on Linux, macOS, and Windows. OS-specific code lives exclusively in `src-tauri/src/platform/`. Never use OS-specific paths, commands, or assumptions outside this module. CI tests all three platforms on every push.

## Coding Conventions

- Rust: use `thiserror` for error types via `AppError` enum. Propagate with `?`, never `.unwrap()` in production code.
- All new Rust modules must have `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` with unit tests.
- Frontend: TypeScript strict mode, camelCase for TS types matching Rust's `#[serde(rename_all = "camelCase")]`.
- JSON parsing from LLMs uses a 3-tier fallback: direct parse -> brace-balanced extraction -> regex field salvage.
- Thumbnails and classification caches mirror the source `rel_path` structure under their respective dirs.
- Frontend shared utilities (`basename`, `errorMessage`) live in `src/utils.ts`. Modal CSS shares base styles via `shared-modal.css`.
- **App.tsx is an orchestrator** — it composes hooks and renders layout. Feature-specific state and handlers must live in dedicated hooks under `src/hooks/`. New tool modes (like DuplicatesView, FacesView, PdfPasswordsView) should be self-contained components that manage their own data loading. App.tsx only holds: layout state (sidebar, modals, preview), search/filter state, and thin mode-switching coordination.

## Important Paths

- Database: `~/.local/share/frank_sherlock/db/index.sqlite`
- Thumbnails: `~/.local/share/frank_sherlock/cache/thumbnails/`
- Classification cache: `~/.local/share/frank_sherlock/cache/classifications/`
- Surya venv: `~/.local/share/frank_sherlock/surya_venv/`
- Surya OCR script: `sherlock/desktop/src-tauri/scripts/surya_ocr.py`

## Testing

```bash
# Rust (from sherlock/desktop/src-tauri/)
cargo test                     # 322 tests

# Frontend (from sherlock/desktop/)
npm run test                   # 299 tests
```

Tests cover: JSON parsing fallbacks, thumbnail generation, incremental scan discovery, DB operations (upsert, touch, delete, FTS), query parsing, scan job persistence, platform abstraction, and all UI components. Shared test fixtures live in `src/__tests__/fixtures.ts`.

## Database Migration Rules

Schema is managed by `rusqlite_migration` in `db.rs`. Migrations are tracked via `PRAGMA user_version`.

- Never edit or reorder existing migrations — they are identified by position.
- Never modify existing `CREATE TABLE` column definitions in a shipped migration.
- To add a column: append a new `M::up("ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN ... DEFAULT ...")`.
- Every migration must be safe to run on an existing database (idempotent where possible).
- Test with both fresh databases and existing databases.
- Never delete data or drop columns without explicit user consent.

## Release Workflow

- When tagging or retagging a version, **always update the release notes** in `releases/vX.Y.Z.md` to reflect all changes included in that tag.
- Release notes are loaded by the release workflow and included in GitHub Releases automatically.
- The AUR package (`frank-sherlock-bin`) is auto-published via `.github/workflows/aur-publish.yml` when a release is published.
- **Three builds must succeed** on every release: Linux (AppImage), macOS (DMG), Windows (MSI). CI runs on all three platforms — never merge or tag if any platform is broken.
- The AUR PKGBUILD downloads the AppImage and extracts desktop file + icons. If the Tauri `productName`, icon names, or desktop file contents change, the PKGBUILD template in `aur-publish.yml` must be updated to match.
- AUR repo: `ssh://aur@aur.archlinux.org/frank-sherlock-bin.git` (separate from this repo, auto-managed by CI).

## What NOT to Change

- Never modify files in scanned target directories.
- Never remove the FTS5 virtual table without migration logic.
- Keep `csp: null` in `tauri.conf.json` — needed for `convertFileSrc` asset protocol.
- The Surya OCR script must stay compatible with being run from an isolated venv (no system Python imports).
