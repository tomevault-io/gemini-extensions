# StreamKit Agent Notes

These notes apply to coding agents (Claude/Codex/Devin/etc.) contributing to
this repo. Agent-assisted contributions are welcome, but should be **supervised**
and **reviewed by a human** before merge.

## What is StreamKit

StreamKit is a self-hostable media processing server (Rust). A single binary
(`skit`) runs pipelines as a node graph (DAG) — via a web UI, YAML, or
WebSocket API. Two modes: **dynamic** (real-time, hot-reconfigurable) and
**oneshot** (stateless batch processing). See `agent_docs/architecture.md` for
the full architecture.

## Codebase Map

| Directory | Purpose |

| `docs/` | Astro + Starlight docs site (sidebar in `docs/astro.config.mjs`) |

## Tech Stack

- **Rust** (version pinned in `rust-toolchain.toml`), tokio, axum, wgpu
- **UI:** React 19, TypeScript, Zustand, Jotai, React Query, Radix UI, React Flow
- **Build/tooling:** `just` (task runner), Bun (UI), sccache (Rust build cache)
- **Testing:** `cargo test` (Rust), Vitest (UI), Playwright (E2E)
- **Platform:** Linux x86_64

## Workflow

- Keep PRs focused and minimal.
- Run `just test` and `just lint` before submitting (or explain why you couldn't).
- Follow `CONTRIBUTING.md`: DCO sign-off (`git commit -s`), Conventional
  Commits, SPDX license headers on all new files.
- **Linting discipline**: Do not blindly suppress lint warnings with
  ignore/exception rules. Refactor instead. If a suppression is truly necessary,
  include a comment explaining the rationale.
- **UI tooling**: Use `bun install` / `bunx` / `bun run` — never npm or pnpm.

## Comment Guidelines

> *"NEVER try to explain HOW your code works in a comment … just tell
> people WHY."*
> — [Linux kernel coding style, §8](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html)

> *"The best code is self-documenting. Giving sensible names to types and
> variables is much better than using obscure names that you must then
> explain through comments."*
> — [Google C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Comments)

Default is **no comment**. If you feel compelled to add one, first ask
whether a better name or a small extraction would make it unnecessary.
Comments that restate the *how* (what the code obviously does) add noise
and drift out of sync; comments that explain the *why* (constraints,
trade-offs, gotchas invisible from the code alone) prevent real bugs.

### Do NOT write

These antipatterns accounted for ~3,500 lines removed in the v0.5 cleanup.

- **Line narration** — restating what the next line does
  (`// Send packet` before `send_packet()`, `// Check if empty` before
  `if x.is_empty()`). The [Google C++ guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Implementation_Comments)
  limits implementation comments to "tricky, non-obvious, interesting, or
  important parts"; obvious code needs nothing.
- **`// Helper: X`** labels on descriptively-named functions — the name
  already tells the reader; a label adds nothing.
- **Verbose JSDoc / `///` on self-documenting items** — an essay on
  `PARAM_THROTTLE_MS = 33` or per-field docs like
  `/** Handler for slider onChange event */` adds zero information.
  [Rust RFC 505](https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/0505-api-comment-conventions.html)
  and the [Rust API Guidelines](https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/documentation.html)
  recommend a **single-line summary** as the first doc comment line;
  anything beyond that should earn its keep.
- **Section dividers** — `// --- Public Modules ---`, `// State`,
  `// Handlers`. Use blank lines or code structure instead.
- **Step-by-step numbered narration** — `// 1. Validate`, `// 2. Connect`.
  Extract named functions instead of numbering prose.
- **Complexity apologies** — multi-paragraph justifications above lint
  suppressions. Keep the rationale to one line.
- **Standard framework behavior** — `"useState setters are stable"`,
  `"useMemo prevents re-renders"`. Any React/Tokio/Axum developer knows this.
- **Dead code "for reference"** — git history preserves it. Delete it.
  As Google's [documentation best practices](https://google.github.io/styleguide/docguide/best_practices.html)
  put it: *"Dead docs are bad. They misinform, they slow down, they incite
  despair."* The same applies to dead code.
- **Diff-oriented comments** — comments whose only purpose is to explain your
  edit ("now we also check X", "previously this did Z"). Put that context in
  the PR description instead.

### DO write

- **`// SAFETY:`** on `unsafe` blocks and FFI boundaries — Rust convention
  and required by `clippy::undocumented_unsafe_blocks`.
- **Lint suppression rationales** — required by the Linting discipline rule
  above. Always include `-- reason` (eslint) or `// reason` (`#[allow]`).
- **Non-obvious constraints** invisible from reading the code — performance
  contracts (`React.memo` referential-stability requirements), DOM-ordering
  guards required by Playwright selectors, protocol/codec quirks. The
  [Google C++ guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Implementation_Comments)
  calls these out: *"tricky or complicated code blocks should have comments
  before them."*
- **Design decisions** that differ from the intuitive default — e.g. why
  session mode no longer implicitly enables publishing.
- **`@public`** tags on APIs consumed by external tools (Playwright, MCP).
- **Concurrency invariants** — lock-ordering, channel backpressure
  semantics, and synchronization assumptions. The
  [Google C++ guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Class_Comments)
  specifically requires documenting *"the synchronization assumptions the
  class makes."*

Rule of thumb: **code tells you *how*, comments tell you *why***
([Coding Horror, 2006](https://blog.codinghorror.com/code-tells-you-how-comments-tell-you-why/),
paraphrasing Kernighan). If a comment explains a constraint that isn't
visible from reading the code alone, keep it. If it restates what the
code obviously does, delete it.

## Fix Root Causes, Not Symptoms

Prefer a clean change that takes longer over a brittle stack of patches that
ships sooner. If a feature requires defending against the same race in three
places, layering synchronous shadow refs over async state, or "preferring
draft over live" because two event sources disagree on timing — **stop and
reconsider the contract**, don't add a fourth patch.

Concrete signals you've crossed into workaround territory:

- You're adding a *timeout* to recover from a missing event.
- You need a synchronous shadow of state that already lives in an async store.
- You catch yourself writing "the X event doesn't actually mean X, it means
  *attempted* X, so we also have to listen for Y to know if it really
  happened."
- Tests are updated by adding sleeps or by relying on previously-broken
  behavior (e.g. an invalid value being silently accepted).
- The root cause is in a different layer than the one you're editing, and
  fixing it there would invalidate most of your patch.

When you spot this, surface the design issue to the user with a concrete
proposal — even if it's more invasive — *before* writing the patch. State
the tradeoff honestly: "this will take longer but produces something
durable; vs. this short-term fix has these specific brittleness costs."

Past incident worth remembering: the WebSocket `nodeadded` event used to fire
before plugin construction had even started. The UI accumulated 13 commits of
draft-state machinery (state-watchers, debounce timers, topology priority
hacks) trying to reconstruct "did the node actually get created?" from
out-of-band signals. The actual fix was a small server change — emit
`nodeadded` from the engine actor's success path instead of the WS handler —
which collapsed the UI back to the obvious cleanup. Code that exists to
paper over a broken contract should be deleted, not refined.

## Docker

- Official images: `Dockerfile` (CPU) and `Dockerfile.gpu` (GPU) via `.github/workflows/docker.yml`.
- Health endpoint: `/healthz` (also `/health`).
- Standard images do not bundle ML models or plugins — mount them at runtime.
  Demo images (`Dockerfile.demo`, tagged `-demo`) include bundled models and plugins.

## MCP (Model Context Protocol) Integration

StreamKit embeds an MCP server (`apps/skit/src/mcp/`) that exposes the
control plane as MCP tools, prompts, and resources. **Agents with MCP client
support can use this directly** — no REST/WebSocket code needed.

- **Endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/mcp` (Streamable HTTP) or `skit mcp` (STDIO)
- **Config:** `[mcp]` section in `skit.toml` — set `enabled = true`
- **Auth:** HTTP transport uses bearer tokens (same as REST API). STDIO is
  unauthenticated (admin-level, local-only).
- **Code:** `apps/skit/src/mcp/mod.rs` (tools + resources),
  `apps/skit/src/mcp/prompts.rs` (prompts)
- **Tests:** `apps/skit/tests/mcp_integration_test.rs`

See [`agent_docs/mcp.md`](agent_docs/mcp.md) for the full tool/prompt/resource
reference and usage patterns.
