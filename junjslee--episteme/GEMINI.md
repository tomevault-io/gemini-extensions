Everything below is the operational contract; it does not replace the kernel.

## What this repository is

A portable cognitive kernel for AI agents. The kernel is markdown
(vendor-neutral). Adapters mount the kernel into specific runtimes
(Claude Code, Hermes, future). The kernel defines *how the agent thinks*;
everything else in this repo is delivery plumbing.

**Do not treat this repo as a general-purpose codebase.** It is a
governance + cognition product whose own artifacts are its thesis.

## Build, test, sync

```bash
# Install (idempotent)
pip install -e .

# Verify health
episteme doctor

# Verify kernel integrity
episteme kernel verify   # detects drift in managed files

# Push kernel + profile to all adapters
episteme sync

# Run tests
PYTHONPATH=. pytest -q

# Static check
python3 -m py_compile src/episteme/cli.py
```

Local Python work runs in whichever Python invokes the CLI (`sys.executable`). Pin a specific runtime via `$EPISTEME_PYTHON_PREFIX` (install root) or `$EPISTEME_PYTHON` (exact binary). Set `EPISTEME_REQUIRE_CONDA=1` to enforce Conda `base`.

---

## Kernel invariants (do NOT modify without the Evolution Contract)

1. The four principles in `kernel/CONSTITUTION.md` are load-bearing. Adding, removing, or reframing one requires a major version bump in `kernel/CHANGELOG.md` and a propose → critique → gate → promote loop per `docs/EVOLUTION_CONTRACT.md`.
2. The six-failure-mode taxonomy in `kernel/FAILURE_MODES.md` is a 1:1 mapping. Removing a counter artifact means naming which failure mode is now unprotected. If the answer is "none" — the artifact was not earning its place.
3. The Reasoning Surface is four fields: Knowns, Unknowns, Assumptions, Disconfirmation. Do not rename or collapse them.
4. `kernel/KERNEL_LIMITS.md` declares the kernel's boundary. Claims to universal applicability without updating this file violate Principle I.
5. `kernel/REFERENCES.md` is the attribution contract. Introducing a new load-bearing concept into kernel wording without a primary-source entry violates Principle I.

---

## Workflow convention for non-trivial work

All consequential edits follow the kernel's own loop:

1. **Frame.** State the Core Question in one sentence. Identify the uncomfortable friction driving the work.
2. **Decompose.** Fill the Reasoning Surface (Knowns / Unknowns / Assumptions / Disconfirmation). For high-impact work, provide 2+ options with trade-offs and an explicit because-chain.
3. **Execute.** Prefer smallest reversible action that produces new information. One bounded lane per task owner.
4. **Verify.** Validate against success criteria, not effort. Re-check each assumption. Evaluate hypothesis: validated / refined / invalidated.
5. **Handoff.** Update `docs/PROGRESS.md`, `docs/NEXT_STEPS.md`. Name residuals explicitly.

High-impact decisions must record to `.episteme/reasoning-surface.json` before the action. See `kernel/HOOKS_MAP.md`.

---

## Boundaries

### Do NOT touch

- `core/memory/global/*.md` — operator's personal memory; gitignored; writing to it is an identity violation
- `.claude/settings.local.json` — machine-local overrides; gitignored
- `kernel/MANIFEST.sha256` directly — regenerate with `episteme kernel update` after intentional kernel edits
- Any file matching `**/.env*`, `secrets/*`, private keys

### Handle with care (checkpoint before acting)

- `kernel/*.md` — load-bearing contract; see kernel invariants above
- `docs/MEMORY_CONTRACT.md`, `docs/EVOLUTION_CONTRACT.md` — governance specs
- `core/schemas/*` — versioned JSON schemas; breaking changes require a contract version bump
- Adapters (`adapters/*`, `core/adapters/*.json`) — delivery layer; changes here can silently desync operator profiles across runtimes

### Safe to edit freely

- `docs/*.md` (except the contract files above)
- `skills/custom/*`, `skills/private/*`
- `templates/*`
- `tests/*`
- `src/episteme/*` under usual engineering discipline

---

## Prohibited patterns

- **No unattended code-writing-to-merge loops.** Principle IV — the loop needs integrity, not compression past it.
- **No bypassing hooks** with `--no-verify`, `--no-gpg-sign`, or equivalent without explicit user authorization.
- **No `rm -rf`, `git reset --hard`, `git push --force`** without a human checkpoint. `core/hooks/block_dangerous.py` enforces this.
- **No writing to `core/memory/global/`** from any automated flow. It is the operator's first-person memory.
- **No introducing a borrowed concept** into kernel wording without a corresponding `kernel/REFERENCES.md` entry.
- **No claiming universal applicability** for the kernel without updating `kernel/KERNEL_LIMITS.md`.

---

## Commit and handoff conventions

- Commit messages: imperative mood, scoped (`kernel: …`, `docs: …`, `adapters: …`). Checkpoint commits use prefix `chkpt:`.
- Every substantive change updates `docs/PROGRESS.md` with a Reasoning Surface block.
- Every session ends by updating `docs/NEXT_STEPS.md` with a one-sentence "So-What Now?".
- Branch naming: `feat/<name>`, `fix/<name>`, `research/<name>`, `ops/<name>`, `docs/<name>`.

---

## Scaling by delegation

Subagents live in `core/agents/` and install into `~/.claude/agents/`.

- **Planner** — multi-step sequencing and risk mapping.
- **Researcher** — deep dives into codebases, docs, unknown libraries.
- **Implementer** — focused staged coding once the plan is solid.
- **Reviewer** — cross-referencing implementation against requirements and safety.
- **Orchestrator** — parallel workstream coordination.
- **Structural governance:** domain-architect, reasoning-auditor, governance-safety, domain-owner.

Every delegation begins with a **Shared Context Brief** and ends with a **Verification Artifact**.

---

## When to stop and ask

Stop and surface to the human operator before:

- Editing `kernel/*.md` in any way other than fixing a typo.
- Introducing a new runtime adapter.
- Modifying `core/schemas/*`.
- Any irreversible operation (force-push, hard reset, branch deletion, history rewrite).
- Any change that would require bumping `kernel/CHANGELOG.md` major.

The kernel's Principle IV rule applies to itself: small reversible actions beat large irreversible bets. Asking is cheap. Recovery is not.

---

## Attribution

This file inherits its discipline from the kernel:
- Workflow convention — Deming / Shewhart (PDSA), Boyd (OODA tempo).
- Reasoning Surface — Popper (disconfirmation), Kahneman (WYSIATI counter).
- Boundaries — Principle I (explicit > implicit): what is not named is not governed.
