# CLAUDE.md — Training Dashboard

## Project Overview

Android app that tracks a progressive daily exercise routine with adaptive goal setting. Exercise targets scale with a goal level (N) that adjusts based on daily performance:
- Goal level N: N push-ups, 2N sit-ups, 3N squats

**Goal level transitions** (evaluated each calendar day against the previous day's performance):
- 100% completion → N+1
- 33–99% completion → hold at N
- <33% completion → N-1 (floor: 1)

Progress is weighted by rep count: `completed reps / (N + 2N + 3N)`.

**Day N** (displayed prominently) = number of days where the user achieved ≥33% progress — not calendar days. This is computed from the Room database, no extra DataStore key needed.

The adaptive system is intentionally invisible to the user. There is no streak counter, no demotion messaging, no explanation of the rules. The user simply sees "Day N" and today's targets. Goals self-calibrate quietly.

Features: exercise completion tracking, adaptive goal progression, daily reminder notifications, settings dialog.

## Commands

- `./gradlew :app:assembleDebug` — build debug APK (output: `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`)
- `./gradlew :app:assembleRelease` — build signed release APK (requires `KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`, `KEY_ALIAS`, `KEY_PASSWORD` env vars)
- `./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest` — run unit tests
- `./gradlew :app:installDebug` — build + install on connected device/emulator

Use `./gradlew` (the wrapper, Gradle 8.5). The system `gradle` (4.4.1) is too old to build this project.

## Architecture Notes

- **Reactive data flow:** Room DAO returns `Flow<List<DailyCompletion>>` → ViewModel combines into `StateFlow<DashboardUiState>` → Compose collects state
- **Day calculation:** `ChronoUnit.DAYS` from stored start date to today; can be manually overridden via settings
- **Streak calculation:** Iterates backward from current day counting consecutive days where all 3 exercises are completed
- **Database design:** Composite primary key `(dayNumber, exercise)` with upsert for idempotent updates
- **Notifications:** `PeriodicWorkRequest` with 24h interval, `ExistingPeriodicWorkPolicy.UPDATE` for rescheduling

## Key Conventions

- All UI is in Jetpack Compose — no XML layouts
- Composable functions are stateless; state is managed in `DashboardViewModel`
- ProGuard keeps Room entity classes (`data.db.**`)
- Release signing uses environment variables: `KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`, `KEY_ALIAS`, `KEY_PASSWORD`

## CI/CD

- **CI** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): Runs on PRs to main — `assembleDebug` + `test`
- **Release** (`.github/workflows/release.yml`): Triggered by `v*` tags — builds signed APK, creates GitHub release

## Testing

Unit tests exist in `app/src/test/` covering ExerciseTargets, day computation, streak logic, count clamping, and FakeCompletionDao. Run with `./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest`.

Priority areas for additional tests:
- Room DAO: completion queries, upsert behavior (instrumented)
- UI: exercise card interactions, settings dialog (instrumented)
- Full ViewModel integration tests (requires Robolectric for AndroidViewModel)

## UI & Design

The app uses the **Kinetic design system** — a custom visual language documented in `.agents/context/DESIGN_GUIDE.md`. Read it before making any UI changes. Key rules summarised below; the guide is authoritative.

### Design Tokens
- All colors must use named `Kinetic*` tokens from `ui/theme/Color.kt` — never hardcode hex values or use raw `Color.Black` / `Color.White` for surfaces
- Never reference `MaterialTheme.colorScheme.primary` or other Material defaults for styled UI — resolve to a Kinetic token
- `KineticGreenDim` is deprecated; do not use

### Component Rules
- **Corner radius:** minimum 12dp on all cards, buttons, and containers; 8dp only for dialog sub-buttons; 50 for pills/chips
- **Primary CTA buttons:** `Box + .clickable {}` (not Material `Button`), 64dp tall, full-width, `KineticGreen` background, 18sp Black Italic text, `CheckCircle` icon
- **Secondary/cancel buttons:** Material `Button` with `KineticSurfaceContainerHigh` container, or `Box + .clickable {}` — consistent with surrounding elements
- **Icon boxes:** 56dp square, `KineticSurfaceContainerHigh` background, 12dp radius
- **All UI label text is UPPERCASE** — no sentence case in controls or labels
- When in doubt, check `.agents/context/DESIGN_GUIDE.md` before inventing a new pattern

### Before Adding New UI
1. Check the design guide for an existing pattern that covers the use case
2. Use established token values — don't introduce new hardcoded sizes or colors
3. If adding a new pattern, document it in `.agents/context/DESIGN_GUIDE.md`

## Critical Rules

### Code Style
- Use Kotlin idioms: prefer `val` over `var`, data classes for state, named arguments for clarity
- Composable function names are PascalCase nouns; preview functions are suffixed `Preview`
- No XML layouts — all UI is Jetpack Compose; never add View-based components

### Architecture
- All state lives in `DashboardViewModel` as `StateFlow`; composables are stateless and receive state as parameters
- Side effects (DB writes, notifications) are triggered from the ViewModel, never from composables
- Use `combine`/`map` on Flows in the ViewModel; collect with `collectAsStateWithLifecycle` in UI

### Database
- All DAO operations must be `suspend` or return `Flow` — never call them on the main thread
- Use `@Upsert` for idempotent writes; never duplicate insert + delete logic
- Keep entity classes in `data.db.**` so ProGuard rules continue to protect them

### Notifications / Background Work
- Schedule via `ReminderScheduler` using `ExistingPeriodicWorkPolicy.UPDATE` to avoid duplicate workers
- Never post notifications directly from a composable or ViewModel — use `ReminderWorker`
- Notification channels must be created before posting; channel creation is idempotent

### Testing
- Tests go in `app/src/test/` (unit) or `app/src/androidTest/` (instrumented)
- ViewModel tests must inject a fake `AppDatabase` or DAO — never rely on production Room instances
- Test day computation, streak logic, and goal formulas with boundary values (day 0, day 1, large N)

## Documentation Lookup
Only use Context7 MCP when explicitly asked. If you think it would help, ask for permission first — do not auto-invoke it.
