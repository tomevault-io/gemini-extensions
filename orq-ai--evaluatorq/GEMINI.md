# CLAUDE.md — evaluatorq-py

This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working in `packages/evaluatorq-py`.

## Parallel sessions

Parallel agent sessions typically run in their own git worktree, so uncommitted
changes you did not make may appear in the working tree from concurrent work.
**Never run `git stash` (any subcommand) or `git reset`.** Not `stash` to clean
the tree, and not `stash pop`/`apply` either: the stash holds other sessions'
autostash entries, and popping one drops a merge into your tree and consumes the
entry. `git checkout <path>` and `git checkout -- .` are equally destructive to
uncommitted work you did not write. When committing, stage only the exact files
your task changed.

The same applies to every subagent you dispatch — say it in the dispatch prompt.
A reviewer that "just needed a clean tree for a moment" has already popped
another session's autostash once.

To read a file as it is on HEAD without touching the tree, use
`git show HEAD:<path>`. To see only your own changes on a shared dirty tree,
diff the paths you touched: `git diff -- <your paths>`.

## Quick Reference

```bash
# Install dependencies (dev group + all optional extras)
uv sync --all-extras --all-groups

# Run unit tests (excludes integration tests)
uv run pytest -m 'not integration'

# Run a specific test file
uv run pytest tests/redteam/test_vulnerability_first.py -v

# Run integration tests (requires ORQ_API_KEY in .env)
uv run pytest -m integration

# Lint
uv run ruff check src

# Format
uv run ruff format src

# Type check — the whole repo. Never scope it to a path (see "Before pushing").
uv run basedpyright

# Build
uv build

# Serve the docs site locally (live-reload at http://127.0.0.1:8000/evaluatorq/)
uv run --group docs mkdocs serve

# Build the docs site (strict — fails on warnings, as CI does)
uv run --group docs mkdocs build --strict

# Validate mermaid diagrams render in strict renderers (GitHub/VS Code) — runs in CI.
# strict build does NOT catch mermaid label defects; this does.
uv run python scripts/validate_mermaid.py
```

When the user says **“do a test run”**, run the live trace validation for both
pipelines using the configured agent key:

```bash
ORQ_API_KEY=... EVALUATORQ_AGENT_KEY=... \
  uv run python scripts/live_trace_validation.py both
```

This runs 3 personas × 3 scenarios for agent simulation and a small hybrid red-team
check, then validates the root spans and run metadata. Use `orq traces list` to
inspect the resulting traces.

## Opening a PR

**Assign the PR to its author.** `gh pr create` leaves the assignee empty, so
open one with `--assignee @me` — an unassigned PR has no one the board can point
at when it stalls.

Reviewers need no flag: `.github/CODEOWNERS` requests them on every PR and skips
the author. Change that file, not the `gh` invocation, to change who reviews.

## Before pushing to a PR

Run the same checks CI runs, **verbatim**, before every push:

```bash
uv run ruff check src
uv run ruff format --check src
uv run basedpyright                 # whole repo — NOT a path
uv run pytest -m 'not integration'
```

**Do not scope `basedpyright` to a path.** CI runs it bare, which covers `tests/`
as well as `src/`. Running `uv run basedpyright src/` passes clean while CI fails
on type errors in test files — parametrized args annotated `str` where the
signature wants a `Literal`, raw dicts passed where a pydantic model is expected.
That exact mistake left PR #119 red across all four Python versions for three
commits without any local signal.

Note the asymmetry: **ruff** is scoped to `src` (tests are deliberately not
ruff-formatted, so `ruff format --check tests/` reports the whole tree as
unformatted — don't "fix" that). **basedpyright** is not scoped. Match CI, not
intuition.

CI does not run integration tests. Real-API coverage runs weekly via
`.github/workflows/examples-weekly.yml`, which opens an issue on failure rather
than blocking a PR.

## Need X? Use Y. Do not reinvent.

`common/` is the shared layer. Every module there exists because two surfaces
drifted apart and a review consolidated them. Adding a third copy is the failure
mode this table exists to prevent.

| Doing | Use | Never |
|---|---|---|
| Any chat completion | `common.llm_call.execute_chat_completion` / `execute_chat_parse` | `client.chat.completions.create(...)` at a new call site |
| Structured / schema output | `common.structured_output` (parse + `json_object` fallback) | hand-rolled `response_format` + `json.loads` |
| Parsing JSON out of model text | `common.extract_json.extract_json_from_response` | bespoke fence-stripping regex |
| Building call params | `LLMConfig.completion_params(...)` (`contracts.py`) | hand-built `extra_kwargs` dict — it skips the reserved-key guard |
| Resolving an LLM client | `common.llm_client.resolve_llm_client` | `AsyncOpenAI(...)` anywhere but that module |
| Retry / backoff | `common.retry.with_retry`, or the SDK's own `max_retries` — **exactly one of the two** | a second retry layer on a client that already retries (they multiply) |
| Calling the target under test | `common.target_call.call_target_with_retry` | ad-hoc `respond()` + try/except |
| LLM-as-judge | `common.judge.run_judge`; multi-judge via `common.jury` | new judge prompt + parse loop |
| OTel spans, token usage, cost | `common.tracing` (`with_llm_span`, `record_token_usage`, `record_llm_response`) | `get_tracer` / `start_as_current_span` outside a `tracing.py` module |
| Surface-specific span naming | `redteam/tracing.py`, `simulation/tracing.py` — thin wrappers that delegate | new span vocabulary |
| Prompt templating | `common.template_engine.render_template` | f-string prompt assembly |
| Untrusted text into a prompt | `common.sanitize.delimit` | raw interpolation |
| Run lifecycle state | `common.run_manifest` (`start_manifest`, `list_manifests`) | new status dict / sidecar file |
| Applying recommendations to an agent | `common.apply.apply_recommendations` | surface-local merge logic |
| Console / HTML / MD report output | `common/reports/` (`console`, `render`, `vega`, `palette`) | new renderer or colour set |
| CLI output, errors, JSON, width | `common/cli_*.py` | bespoke `typer.echo` formatting |
| Normalising agent output shapes | `common.output_adapters`, `common.messages` | per-surface `isinstance` ladders |
| Turning message content or a tool result into text | `contracts.content_to_text` / `tool_result_to_text` | `str()` on a `str \| list[ContentPart]` — it renders a Python repr that a judge then scores |
| Building an Orq SDK client | `common.orq_client.resolve_orq_client` | `Orq(...)` anywhere but that module |
| Rendering a transcript as Responses `input` | `openresponses.input_items.messages_to_responses_input` | a hand-built `{'role', 'content'}` list — an assistant turn needs `output_text` parts or the Orq router **silently drops it** |


## House rules

Distilled from review findings that recurred. Each cost a review round.

- **One retry layer.** SDK `max_retries` and `with_retry` compose multiplicatively. Pick one per call path, and say which in the docstring.
- **No optimistic defaults on unknown shapes.** A result whose schema you cannot read must log and count as unknown — never as passed, resisted, or $0. Silence reads as a clean run.
- **A degraded path announces itself.** Falling back, skipping, or returning a literal gets a `logger.warning` naming the cause. Two branches next to each other must not differ in whether they log.
- **Never bypass a wrapper to get at its inner call.** If a helper's signature is in your way, change the helper. Going around it drops its validation — that is how `_RESERVED_COMPLETION_KEYS` got skipped.
- **Caller-supplied values win merges.** `{**defaults, **caller}`, and the docstring states it.
- **No drive-by reformatting.** Quote-style and signature re-wrapping in an unrelated file hides the behaviour change and collides with parallel sessions.
- **Test the failure branch you documented.** If the docstring promises degradation to inconclusive, a test exercises it. All-success fakes prove nothing.
- **A helper with no caller is a bug.** Either call it or delete it; do not recompute its body inline.
- **Nothing stateful is shared across concurrent work.** `evaluate()` / `simulate()` / `red_team()` run datapoints concurrently: give each task its own target via `new()` (a shared `ORQAgentTarget` races on `_task_id`), and key per-item assignment on the dataset row, never on an arrival-order cursor. An `asyncio` primitive binds to the loop that first blocks on it — don't reuse one across loops.
- **A new registry copies `vulnerability_registry.py`.** Assert `set(Enum) == set(registry)` at import time and freeze with `MappingProxyType`; a plain mutable dict drifts silently as the enum grows.
- **Every filtered UI section renders an empty state.** A section that disappears on zero matches is indistinguishable from a bug.
- **Never ask a judge for a verdict that inverts between types.** `must_happen` and `must_not_happen` mean opposite things by the same `passed` flag, and models get it backwards — gpt-5.4-mini marked a satisfied `must_happen` as unmet while its own `reason` said the opposite. Ask for the one factual thing (*did it occur?*) and map occurrence to pass/fail in code.
- **Provider usage/cost shapes are not interchangeable.** Anthropic reports cache reads top-level where Orq/OpenAI nest them. Build the test fixture from the provider SDK's own models so a schema move fails the test instead of confirming the guess.

Guardrails for the mechanical parts live in `tests/test_reuse_guardrails.py`.
A failure there names the canonical helper — use it, don't extend the allowlist.

## Keeping this file true

This file only works if it absorbs what review teaches. When a review comment,
CI failure, or bug traces back to a convention that was not written down:

1. Add it **in the same PR** — one table row or one house rule, not a paragraph.
2. Add the mechanical check too, if one is possible (`tests/test_reuse_guardrails.py`, a ruff rule).
3. Delete something stale while you are here. Above ~200 lines this file gets skimmed, and skimmed is the same as absent.

Do not add a directory tree, a file inventory, or anything else the filesystem
already answers.

## Key Patterns

### Data Model

- **Vulnerability is the atomic primitive** — strategies, evaluators, and datapoints all bind to `Vulnerability` enum values
- Framework categories (ASI01, LLM01) are a derived mapping layer via `VulnerabilityDef.framework_mappings`
- `passed=True` means RESISTANT (attack failed), `passed=False` means VULNERABLE (attack succeeded)

### Target calls and error payloads

**Every target call goes through `call_target_with_retry`** (`common/target_call.py`).
Calling `target.respond()` directly skips retry, the per-call timeout, and backend
error mapping — and, worse, tends to skip the error payload with it.

**Never hand an `AgentResponseError` object to the report layer.** `JobOutputPayload.error`
and `AttackOutput.error` are `str`; the object fails validation and takes down report
generation for the **entire run**, after every attack has been executed, judged and
billed. Flatten with `TargetCallResult.error_payload()` — it is the single source for
the six `error*` fields, so the format can't drift between the static, hybrid, pipeline
and orchestrator paths (it did, three ways, before it was consolidated).

The reverse failure is quieter and worse: a job that returns **no** `error` key at all
makes `output_error_text` return `None`, so the judge scores the literal `[ERROR: ...]`
marker as a genuine agent reply and a dead target comes back RESISTANT. Both static legs
now emit the key unconditionally (`None` on success). A new job that calls a target must
do the same.

### Adding New Features

- New vulnerabilities: see `docs/custom-evaluators-and-frameworks.md`
- New evaluators: create a function returning `LlmEvaluatorEntity`, register in `VULNERABILITY_EVALUATOR_REGISTRY`
- New strategies: create `AttackStrategy` objects, register in `strategy_registry.py`
- New backends: implement the `AgentTarget` ABC from `evaluatorq.contracts` (subclass `Backend` from `backends/base.py` for full target lifecycle)

### Testing Conventions

- Unit tests in `tests/unit/`, integration tests in `tests/integration/`
- Red team tests in `tests/redteam/`
- Mark integration tests with `@pytest.mark.integration`
- Default pytest timeout is 120s (configured in `pyproject.toml`)
- Use `pytest-asyncio` for async tests

### Dependencies

- `uv` (not pip), `hatchling` build. Runtime deps and extras are listed in `pyproject.toml` — read it there.
- Only `pydantic`/`httpx`/`rich`/`loguru`/`typer`/`openai` are always installed. Everything else is behind an extra: a module that imports one at module scope must itself only be imported behind that extra (that is why `redteam/ui/`, `dashboard/` and the integrations can import `streamlit`/`fasthtml`/`langchain` at the top). Anywhere else, import inside the function.
- Adding a new dependency needs a reason a few lines of stdlib cannot cover.

### Environment Variables

- `ORQ_API_KEY` — ORQ platform authentication
- `ORQ_BASE_URL` — ORQ API base URL (optional override; default `https://my.orq.ai`)
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` — for direct OpenAI backend or pipeline LLM calls
- `ORQ_WORKSPACE` (or `ORQ_WORKSPACE_SLUG`) — workspace slug for dashboard→Orq trace deep-links; buttons hidden when unset
- `ORQ_UI_BASE_URL` — optional Orq UI base for deep-links (defaults to `ORQ_BASE_URL` or `https://my.orq.ai`)
- `EVALUATORQ_APPLY_MODEL` — model for the dashboard's apply-recommendations merge (default `gpt-5.6-luna`)

### Code Style

- Python 3.10+ compatible (use `from __future__ import annotations` for newer typing syntax)
- `StrEnum` polyfill for Python 3.10 (native in 3.11+)
- Linting: ruff
- Type checking: basedpyright (lenient config — many rules disabled)
- Logging: `loguru` everywhere (core runtime dependency since 1.3)

### Releases

Releases are **tag-driven**. The package version comes from the latest git tag via
`hatch-vcs` (`[tool.hatch.version] source = "vcs"`) — there is **no `version` field
in `pyproject.toml`** and nothing is committed back to `main` on release. The
release workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`, on push to `main`) only pushes a
**tag**, which the `Protect-main` branch ruleset does not govern, so a plain
`GITHUB_TOKEN` is enough (no deploy key, no bypass). **You do not bump the version
or tag by hand on the normal path** — commit messages drive it.

- **Commits MUST follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org).** python-semantic-release (used only as a *version calculator* — `semantic-release version --print`) maps the commit types since the last tag to the next version:
  - `feat:` → minor; `fix:`/`perf:` → patch; `feat!:`/`fix!:`/`BREAKING CHANGE:` → major; `docs:`/`chore:`/`ci:`/`test:`/`refactor:`/`style:`/`build:`/`revert:` → no release.
- On a release-worthy push the workflow: computes the next version, **pushes the tag `vX.Y.Z`**, builds the wheel/sdist (version derived from the tag), **publishes to PyPI via token auth** (the `PYPI_TOKEN` repo secret, passed to `pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish`), then creates a GitHub Release with PR-based auto-notes (`.github/release.yml` controls the categories — merged PRs + contributor attributions).
- **Never write a breaking commit without explicit approval.** Do not use `feat!:`/`fix!:` or a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer unless the user has explicitly approved a major release for that change. A single one halts **all** releases (see next bullet) until a human forces a bump — in July 2026 three `!` commits froze PyPI on `v1.10.1` for 24 days and 317 commits, and the client bug that surfaced it was already fixed in an unreleased commit. If a change is genuinely breaking, ask first; otherwise land it as `feat:`/`fix:`/`refactor:` and describe the break in the PR body.
- **Accidental majors are refused.** A computed `major` bump is skipped unless you re-run via **workflow_dispatch** with `force_level=major`. Use `force_level=minor`/`patch` to override the computed level (e.g. to ship breaking changes as a minor deliberately). The refusal **fails the run** (`::error::` + `exit 1`) so a blocked release is visible; a genuine no-op (e.g. a `docs:`-only push, nothing to release) still exits 0 and stays green. The `!` commits stay in range until someone releases, so the block is permanent, not transient — a red Release run means act, not retry.
- The GitHub Release notes are generated from merged PRs and are created last, non-blocking — a notes failure never blocks the PyPI publish. The committed `CHANGELOG.md` is hand-written and separate from them: a behaviour change to a public default belongs under its `### Notable defaults` section in the same PR, not only in a docstring.
- PyPI publishing uses the **`PYPI_TOKEN`** repo secret (an API token). To switch to OIDC trusted publishing later, configure a **Trusted Publisher** on PyPI for this repo + `release.yml` (PyPI → project → Publishing) and delete the `with: password:` block in the publish step — `id-token: write` is already granted.

### Docs

**Docs ship in the same PR as the feature.** If a change touches public surface
(`__all__`, CLI flags or defaults, env vars, enum/registry members) or adds a
feature, update the docs before opening the PR:

1. `docs-drift` skill, scoped to the diff — finds claims the change made untrue.
2. `docs-coverage` skill — if the change opens a new usage path (a new mode,
   backend, surface, entry point), write the prose now rather than deferring it.

The interaction surface those skills reason about — the axes, the tier rules, and
the impossible-combination list — is
[`.claude/skills/docs-coverage/axes.md`](.claude/skills/docs-coverage/axes.md).
Read it when adding anything users choose between; **a new dimension means editing
that file in the same PR**, or coverage checking silently stops seeing it.

Rules live in the skills, not here. Both are under `.claude/skills/`.

**Fence every code sample in a docstring, with a language.** An indented block or an
RST `Example::` literal reaches Pygments with no lexer and renders as grey text; nothing
warns, and `mkdocs build --strict` stays green. Keep the body under `Example:` / `Usage:`
**un-indented** — griffe only opens a Google section when the body is indented, and an
indented fence inside a `cleandoc`-ed docstring becomes a literal code block instead.
In `examples/*.py`, a fence inside the module docstring is embedded in the generated
page's own fence, so it must stay 3 backticks — `write_example_pages` widens the outer
one to compensate. `docs/hooks.py` fails the build on any unhighlighted block, on
**every** page; the two exemptions there are prose diagrams, not an escape hatch.
