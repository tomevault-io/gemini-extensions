# fastagent — Agent Guide

## What this is

fastagent is "Vibe first. Then FastAgent" for agent directories: it turns a file-defined agent (`persona.md` identity, `skills/`, tools, and existing `AGENTS.md` project context) into a live service inside an app, on GitHub, in Telegram, or behind a custom channel without a new authoring DSL.

The stable design center is the engine-neutral Agent Handler contract (`docs/SPEC.md`); pi (`@earendil-works/pi-*`) is the reference implementation.

## Source of truth

| Document | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `docs/SPEC.md` | The locked v0.1 Agent Handler contract. Do not change its semantics without an explicit decision. |
| `docs/design/core.md` | The pi reference implementation and current architecture. |
| `docs/design/participant-model.md` | When a chat channel speaks, where it answers, what it remembers. Authority for Feishu/Lark + Slack routing. |
| `docs/overview.md`, `docs/README.md` | Product overview and documentation index. |
| `CONTRIBUTING.md` | The full GitHub workflow (branch model, PR loop, merge strategy, review policy). |

Code truth is `src/`.

## DevX Principle Stack

fastagent *is* a developer-experience product: its whole promise is turning an existing agent definition into a service **without rewriting it**. The user is an agent author, and the artifact is their tool. These principles (adapted from [cpojer's Principles of DevX](https://cpojer.net/posts/principles-of-devx)) are a **stack ordered by priority**: the lowest is the foundation we least violate. When two principles conflict, keep the lower one. Violating a principle is sometimes correct — the point is to *name the trade-off* when you do.

1. **Focus on the user (foundation).** The author already has `AGENTS.md` + `skills/`; our job is velocity, not ceremony. Optimize, in order: workflow performance (`dev`/`start` must be fast), **actionable signal** (every failure surfaces as a `failed` event with a diagnosable message — never a silent fallback or a swallowed throw), reliability, documentation (`init` is complete-by-default so authors self-unblock), and scalability. Do the boring author-facing win over the shiny internal rewrite. Serve tomorrow's author too: prefer changes that keep large/growing definitions maintainable.
2. **Incremental migration.** Both directions. For users: adoption is incremental (existing definition → service, a few rough edges acceptable if the path forward is viable). For us: migrate systems in place; a full rewrite pauses maintenance and usually loses. If you *must* rewrite, say so explicitly and own the risk.
3. **Clarity.** Surface the *right* level of complexity at the best interaction point — do not mask it in the name of "getting out of the way." The `docs/SPEC.md` contract is the narrative; keep plans, APIs, and names plain. It's never too early to share a draft (this is what the PR loop is for) — test changes with whoever has the most context before building.
4. **Re-evaluate assumptions, constraints, trade-offs.** Engine-/model-/cloud-neutrality exists *because* these change. Old code wasn't bad — its constraints differed; gain that context before reshaping it. Be honest that most solutions carry negative trade-offs; refuse the ones that put us in a worse future position, and don't stack complex abstractions on complex systems.
5. **Maximize option value.** Every change should unlock more future options, not fewer. This is the architecture's design center: a neutral contract, clear API boundaries, swappable implementations (the `PiSessionStore` port, `engines/pi/`), and carefully chosen dependencies. Prefer modular seams that let a piece be replaced over monoliths that must move as one.

## Working rules specific to this repo

- **The contract is engine-neutral.** `src/agent.ts` must not import any engine (`@earendil-works/pi-*` only under `src/engines/`).
- **Fail visibly.** Errors must surface; no swallowed exceptions, no silent fallbacks. On the invoke path, failures become `failed` events (SPEC MUST 2), never thrown iteration errors.
- **Stateless invoke.** Each invoke builds a fresh harness and discards it; durable state lives behind `PiSessionStore`. Do not introduce in-process session state.
- **Public surface is scoped on purpose.** `src/core.ts` is engine-neutral, `src/pi.ts` is the pi reference surface, and `src/index.ts` combines them. Pi-coupled internals (L0 `createPiAgentFromHarness`, `piHarnessFactory`, assembly helpers) remain unexported — import them from their modules for tests/custom wiring, do not re-export them.
- **The artifact is the truth.** Deployment behavior must come from the bundled definition, not the builder machine's global state.

## GitHub workflow (summary)

Full version: `CONTRIBUTING.md`. The essentials:

1. **Local-first.** Verify locally before opening a PR; do not push to discover bugs in CI.
   ```bash
   npm run lint && npm run typecheck && npm test
   ```
2. **Branch → PR → CI → merge.** Never commit directly to `main`. Branch prefixes: `feature/`, `fix/`, `refactor/`, `docs/`, `chore/`, `ci/`, `test/`.
3. **Squash merge only** (repo settings enforce it): one PR = one commit on `main`; curate the PR title/body — they become the commit message. `main` enforces linear history; force-push is forbidden.
4. **Review policy.** Merging is an explicit maintainer decision — agents never merge. Green CI makes a PR eligible; report "ready to merge" and stop. External-contributor PRs are reviewed and merged by a maintainer.
5. **After merge:**
   ```bash
   git checkout main && git pull --ff-only && git branch -d <branch> && git fetch --prune origin
   ```
6. **Releases publish via npm Trusted Publishing (OIDC), never a local `npm publish`.** The npm package
   must keep its `publish` trusted-publisher binding to `fastagent-sh/fastagent` / `publish.yml` /
   environment `npm`. Flow:
   bump `package.json` in a `chore/release-x.y.z` PR → merge → tag `vX.Y.Z` → create the GitHub Release
   (its notes are the changelog) — `.github/workflows/publish.yml` re-verifies (typecheck + test) and
   publishes to npm from CI. There is no NPM_TOKEN anywhere; a local `npm publish` fails with 401 by
   design.

## Communication

The reader is a senior engineer with full project context. Lead with the conclusion, use tables for structured comparisons, skip obvious reasoning, do not restate, and do not add decorative formatting or meta-narration. Density check: if cutting half the text loses no information, cut it.

优先使用中文回答；面向仓库的产物（代码、注释、文档、commit/PR）一律英文。
