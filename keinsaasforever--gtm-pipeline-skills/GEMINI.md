# GTM Pipeline — Shared Conventions

All GTM pipeline skills must follow these conventions. Read this file before executing any skill.

---

## Working Directory

Every skill run operates inside a `{client-slug}-gtm/` directory. Create it on the first skill invocation for a client. If it already exists, reuse it.

```

└── run_log.md                         ← Chronological log of all skill runs with costs
```

**Client slug:** lowercase, hyphens, no spaces (e.g. `acme-corp-gtm/`, `example-client-gtm/`).

---

## Output Format

Every skill run must end with this summary printed to the user AND appended to `run_log.md`:

```
## Run Summary — {skill name} — {timestamp}
- **Records processed:** {n}
- **Records with results:** {n_found} ({hit_rate}%)
- **Provider used:** {provider_name}
- **Credits consumed:** {credits} (est. {cost_per_record} × {n})
- **Cost:** ~${cost} (if pricing known)
- **Quality assessment:**
  - Hit rate: {hit_rate}%
  - Data completeness: {completeness details}
  - Issues: {issues or "None"}
- **Recommendation:** {proactive suggestion or "None"}

## Not Yet Available
- {list of undocumented tools/endpoints that could improve this run}
- {reference to the skill's "What's Missing" items}
```

**Rules:**
- Produce this summary after every step (test batch, full batch, fallback pass), not just at the end
- Include actual data quality observations, not just numbers — e.g. "2 contacts from wrong country (flagged)"
- The "Not Yet Available" section references items from each skill's own "What's Missing" list

---

## Run Log

Append to `{client-slug}-gtm/run_log.md` after each skill step:

```markdown
### {timestamp} — {skill name} — {step name}
- Provider: {provider}
- Records: {n_processed} → {n_found} ({hit_rate}%)
- Credits: {credits_consumed}
- Cost: ~${cost}
- Duration: {time}
- Notes: {any issues or observations}
```

---

## Provider Performance Log

Append to `{client-slug}-gtm/context/provider_performance.md` after each provider run:

```markdown
### {date} — {provider_name} — {skill}
- Audience: {description of target audience/geography}
- Hit rate: {actual}% (baseline: {expected from guide}%)
- Deviation: {actual - expected}%
- Records: {n}
- Cost: {credits} credits
- Issues: {any}
```

---

## Provider Optimization

After each batch:
1. Compare actual hit rate vs documented baseline (from the skill's provider tables)
2. If deviation > 15 percentage points below baseline → flag and suggest switching providers
3. If multiple providers are available, suggest A/B test on next batch
4. After a full run, produce a provider comparison table if multiple providers were used or could have been used

---

## Demo Mode

When a skill is invoked from the demo flow:
- **No phone enrichment** — email only, skip all phone providers
- **Scope:** ~10 contacts (request 10–15, expect drop-off)
- The demo skill sets this context explicitly when invoking other skills
- People-enrichment must check for this and skip phone providers entirely

---

## Cross-Cutting Rules

These rules apply to every skill in the pipeline:

1. **Plan and test in sandboxes** — validate request/response structure at zero cost before any production call
2. **Test a few leads before the full batch** — 5–15 records, never the full list. If the primary source returns 0 on the probe, switch source before spending the full batch (see People-Source Cadence).
3. **Review results after each run** — inspect actual data rows (names, titles, locations, URLs), not just hit counts
4. **LLM/judgement work is done by the agent** — extraction, scoring, filtering, and message generation run in-context (or via model-routed subagents), never via a third-party LLM API on the default path. See **Model Routing**. Do not silently swap models.
5. **Never re-run before reviewing** — do not waste credits on duplicate runs
6. **Save all API output fields in `intermediate/`** — never drop columns from API responses there. The **lead-facing `output/` view is sanitized** (see Output Sanitization): provenance, statuses, and empty columns are stripped there, not in intermediate.
7. **API keys via runtime injection** — never read `.env` files into context. Use: `export $(grep KEY_NAME /path/.env | xargs) && python3 script.py`
8. **Cloudflare-fronted APIs: use curl** — Pipe0, BetterContact, and FullEnrich reject Python `requests`/`urllib` (Cloudflare blocks the TLS/UA signature, error 1010). Always call them with `curl` + a browser `User-Agent`. Never regenerate a urllib-based provider script.
9. **Max 100 contacts per batch** — all enrichment providers (Pipe0, BC, FE)
10. **Global domains require location filter** — BetterContact with `.com` for global brands returns worldwide results. Always add `lead_location` filter. Local ccTLD domains (`.co.za`, `.de`) are safe without it.
11. **Directory/scrape-sourced company lists: search by NAME, validate by domain-root** — never filter enrichment providers by exact domain (a directory `acme.de` won't match a provider-indexed `acme.com` → both BC and FE return 0). Search by company name + location, then confirm each candidate against the target by domain-root or name token (`fe_company_name` cross-check) to guard generic names. See People-Source Cadence.
12. **Delivery is gated** — writing a message/email to a file is fine; **sending on the user's behalf needs explicit go-ahead** every time.
13. **Ask when critical input is missing** — if an input essential to a correct result is missing or ambiguous (skill-specific: e.g. ICP/target audience, offering & value prop, provider choice or credit budget, tone/language, a required ID or path), ask the user with the **AskUserQuestion** tool rather than guessing. Low-stakes defaults (poll interval, batch size within limits) don't need a prompt.

---

## Model Routing

LLM/judgement work (signal extraction, signal scoring, contact filtering, message generation,
presentation assembly) is done by **the Claude agent**, not by a third-party LLM API. The same
logic runs whether a human invokes a skill interactively or a webhook runs it headless — the
only difference is how the agent is started.

| Task | Model (alias → latest) | How it runs |
|------|------------------------|-------------|
| Contact filtering / ICP ranking | **sonnet** | agent or Sonnet subagent |
| Signal extraction (from Parallel/Firecrawl output) | **opus** | agent or Opus subagent |
| Signal scoring (buying intent 1–100) | **opus** | agent or Opus subagent |
| Message generation | **opus** | agent or Opus subagent |
| Presentation / deck assembly + copy polish | **sonnet** | agent or Sonnet subagent |

- **Interactive (terminal):** the orchestrating agent does the work in-context, or spawns
  model-routed subagents (Sonnet for filtering/presentation, Opus for extraction/scoring/messages).
  **Never shell out to `claude -p`** from inside an interactive session (no nested CLI).
- **Deployed (webhook):** a thin runner calls `claude -p "/gtm-pipeline:demo <prompt>"`. The
  headless agent does the same work — `claude -p` is the *outer entrypoint*, so still no nesting.
- **Fully autonomous scripts (cron/n8n, no agent):** may pass `--llm-backend claude-cli` to shell
  `claude -p`. `--llm-backend openrouter` is a **dormant** legacy path kept on `main` — the code is
  present but **inert**: the flag alone won't run it, `GTM_ALLOW_OPENROUTER=1` must also be set, else
  the script errors out. No deepseek/OpenRouter/Gemini models run on any normal invocation.
- Use model **aliases** (`sonnet`, `opus`) so runs track the latest tier without version-pinning.

Scripts (`signal_search.py`, provider search/enrich, deck builder, `sanitize.py`) do only
**deterministic** work: provider APIs, CSV I/O, dedup, scoring math, sanitization. Default
`signal_search.py --llm-backend agent` collects evidence and leaves scoring to the agent.

---

## People-Source Cadence

Finder/enricher waterfall — stop as soon as a source yields enough **relevant, identity-verified**
contacts. **Max 2 attempts per source** (e.g. a title-token query then a name-only query), then
fall through:

1. **FullEnrich Finder** (0-credit search) — lead for SME / owner-led / non-English-market
   segments (FE indexes these better than BC). Run union queries (title tokens, full titles,
   name-only), dedupe by LinkedIn URL, filter locally.
2. **BetterContact Lead Finder** — for broader / English-market / larger-company segments.
3. **Pipe0 searches** — last-resort finder when FE+BC return 0 relevant candidates for a company
   (keyed on the real domain, it recovers companies the others miss).
4. **Amplemarket / Crustdata** — final tier, max 2 attempts each, for whatever still has no contact.

**Fallback trigger = zero *relevant* contacts, not zero rows.** A provider can return many rows
that are all a *different* company (fuzzy name collision) — cross-check each candidate's returned
company (`fe_company_name`) against the target and count only identity-matches before deciding to
fall through. Probe 3 companies before the full batch; if the primary source returns 0 on the
probe, switch source first.

---

## Signal Quality

Signals are scored on **two axes, in order** — proximity gates, offering-fit prioritizes — and only
count as buying intent if **all** gates hold (enforced by the agent per the signal-search rubric,
and re-checked by `sanitize.py`):

- **Attributable / proximate (Axis 1 — the gate):** the development must genuinely **stem from this
  specific company or the named person at it** — its own funding, hire, product, or stated project.
  A generic industry/market/peer story that merely mentions or could apply to any similar company is
  **not a signal** (score 0). Never invent a connection between sector news and the company; do not
  bend a trend onto a lead. An adjacent actor (partner/customer/competitor) counts only if it forces
  an action *at this company*.
- **Fresh:** within the lookback window (demo default ≤ 60 days / `--lookback-months 2`). Undated
  signals never count as fresh. Stale-signal companies are **demoted to ICP-fit**, never force-fit.
- **Sourced:** carries a live `source_url` **and** a parseable `date`. Drop anything unlinkable.
- **Real:** the source snippet actually supports the claim (re-verify — a "CTO hiring" post can be
  a mislabeled lab role). Geo/segment must match the ICP, not just be recent.
- **Intent, not incumbency:** "already owns a competing/adjacent solution" is **neutral/negative**,
  not hot intent — reposition as a complement/ICP-fit, don't score it as buying intent.

**Offering fit (Axis 2 — priority + hook):** among signals that pass the gates, how tightly the
development ties to what we sell sets the score band, the outreach priority, and the hook. Proximity
decides *whether* to reach out; offering fit decides *how hard* and *with what hook*.

---

## Output Sanitization

`csv/intermediate/` keeps everything. The lead-facing `csv/output/` (and any deck/email built from
it) is sanitized by **`_shared/sanitize.py`** — a deterministic, no-LLM step every demo/outreach run
applies before producing the deliverable:

- **Drop bad emails** — keep only allowed deliverability statuses (default policy `standard`:
  Deliverable + High-probability + Catch-all; `strict` also drops catch-all). The real
  anti-"made-up-address" guard is the upstream **domain-identity cross-check** (people-enrichment):
  a `DELIVERABLE` email on a domain that isn't the target's is a wrong-company hit — drop it.
- **Drop stale/sourceless signals** — per Signal Quality above.
- **Strip provenance** — provider/source labels (`source`, `fullenrich_finder`, `ccv_directory`),
  internal status codes (`email_status`, `HIGH_PROBABILITY`), and technical columns never ship.
- **Drop empty columns** — any column blank across all rows is removed (a demo CSV must never look
  like failed enrichment).
- **Message hygiene** — em-dashes → commas; enforce length caps at write time (LinkedIn ≤ 400,
  email ≤ 450/500) by trimming at a sentence/word boundary, not by hand afterward.

```python
import sys; sys.path.insert(0, os.path.expanduser("~/.claude/skills/gtm-pipeline/_shared"))
from sanitize import sanitize_rows
clean, report = sanitize_rows(rows, email_policy="standard", max_signal_age_days=60)
```

---

## Environment Variables

**.env path:** Set `GTM_ENV_PATH` in `_shared/local.md`. Default fallback: `$HOME/.env.gtm`.

`GTM_ENV_PATH` is documented in `local.md` but is **not** auto-exported into the shell — a fresh shell has it unset, so `"$GTM_ENV_PATH"` silently expands to empty. Always `source` the resolver first; it sets `GTM_ENV_PATH` from (1) an existing env var, else (2) the `GTM_ENV_PATH=` line in `local.md`, else (3) `~/.env.gtm`:

```bash
source "$HOME/.claude/skills/gtm-pipeline/_shared/resolve_env.sh"
```

Never read the .env file with the Read tool. Always inject keys at runtime via Bash, after sourcing the resolver:
```bash
source "$HOME/.claude/skills/gtm-pipeline/_shared/resolve_env.sh" && \
  export $(grep -E '^KEY_NAME=' "$GTM_ENV_PATH" | xargs) && python3 script.py
```

To inject multiple keys at once (anchor patterns with `^` so values can't match):
```bash
source "$HOME/.claude/skills/gtm-pipeline/_shared/resolve_env.sh" && \
  export $(grep -E '^(PIPE0_API_KEY|FULLENRICH_API_KEY|BETTERCONTACT_API_KEY|PARALLEL_API_KEY|SERPAPI_API_KEY|APIFY_API_KEY)=' "$GTM_ENV_PATH" | xargs) && python3 script.py
```

| Variable | Service | Used by |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `PIPE0_API_KEY` | Pipe0 | people-search, people-enrichment, company-enrichment |
| `BETTERCONTACT_API_KEY` | BetterContact | people-search, people-enrichment |
| `FULLENRICH_API_KEY` | FullEnrich | people-search, people-enrichment |
| `SERPAPI_API_KEY` | SerpAPI | company-search, people-search (domain lookup) |
| `PARALLEL_API_KEY` | Parallel AI | people-search (FindAll), signal-search, company-search, company-enrichment |
| `APIFY_API_KEY` | Apify | company-enrichment (SimilarWeb traffic) |
| `PHANTOMBUSTER_API_KEY` | PhantomBuster | company-enrichment (SN scraper), people-search (employees), outreach |
| `LINKEDIN_SESSION_COOKIE` | LinkedIn li_at cookie | all PhantomBuster agents |
| `LINKEDIN_USER_AGENT` | Browser user agent | all PhantomBuster agents |

Other credentials (Firecrawl, Stripe) are requested when the corresponding skill runs. `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` is **legacy/optional** — needed only for `signal_search.py --llm-backend openrouter`; the default `agent` path needs no LLM key (see Model Routing).

**PhantomBuster** scripts load vars in-script rather than via export+inject — see `_shared/phantombuster.md`.

---

## Pipe0 API Helper

All Pipe0 calls must use curl. Standard helper:

```python
import subprocess, json, os

PIPE0_KEY = os.environ["PIPE0_API_KEY"]

def pipe0_request(method, path, body=None):
    cmd = ["curl", "-s", "-w", "\n__HTTP_CODE__%{http_code}",
           "-X", method, f"https://api.pipe0.com/v1{path}",
           "-H", f"Authorization: Bearer {PIPE0_KEY}",
           "-H", "Content-Type: application/json"]
    if body:
        cmd += ["-d", json.dumps(body)]
    result = subprocess.run(cmd, capture_output=True, text=True, timeout=120)
    parts = result.stdout.rsplit("\n__HTTP_CODE__", 1)
    http_code = int(parts[1]) if len(parts) > 1 else 0
    if http_code >= 400:
        raise RuntimeError(f"API error {http_code}: {parts[0][:300]}")
    return json.loads(parts[0]) if parts[0] else {}
```

**Base URLs:**
- Searches (sync): `POST /v1/searches/run/sync`
- Searches (async): `POST /v1/searches/run`
- Pipes: `POST /v1/pipes/run`
- Check pipe status: `GET /v1/pipes/check/{task_id}`
- Sandbox mode: `"config": {"environment": "sandbox"}` — free, validates structure only

---

## Canonical Field Names

All CSV outputs use **snake_case**. When ingesting data from providers that use camelCase or different naming, map to canonical names on first contact.

| Canonical (snake_case) | PB / LinkedIn (camelCase) | FullEnrich / BetterContact | Pipe0 |
|------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------|-------|
| `company_name` | `companyName` | `company_name` | `company_name` |
| `company_domain` | `companyUrl` (extract domain) | `company_domain` | `domain` |
| `company_linkedin_url` | `linkedInCompanyUrl` | `company_linkedin_url` | `linkedin_url` |
| `company_industry` | `linkedinCompanyIndustry` | `industry` | `industry` |
| `company_hq_location` | `linkedinCompanyHeadquarter` | `headquarters` | `hq_location` |
| `company_employee_count` | `linkedinCompanyEmployeesCount` | `employee_count` | `employees` |
| `company_specialities` | `linkedinCompanySpecialities` | — | — |
| `company_founded_year` | `linkedinCompanyFoundedYear` | `founded_year` | `founded` |
| `linkedin_profile_url` | `profileUrl` | `linkedin_url` | `profile_url` |
| `full_name` | `fullName` | `full_name` | `name` |
| `first_name` | `firstName` | `first_name` | `first_name` |
| `last_name` | `lastName` | `last_name` | `last_name` |
| `job_title` | `currentJob` / `title` | `contact_job_title` | `title` |
| `email` | — | `email` | `email` |
| `email_status` | — | `email_status` | `status` |
| `phone` | — | `phone_number` | `phone` |
| `location` | `location` | `location` | `location` |

**When a skill outputs CSV:** use canonical names. **When a skill ingests CSV from a provider:** map to canonical names before writing the intermediate file.

## Terminology

Use these preferred terms for consistency across skills, logs, and user-facing summaries.

| Preferred Term | Avoid |
|---------------|-------|
| Company-First workflow | "Workflow 1" |
| Signal-First workflow | "Workflow 2" |
| ICP score (company-level, 0–100) | `icpScore` (camelCase in code OK; prose uses snake_case) |
| Signal score (buying intent, 1–100) | `overallScore`, "lead score" |
| Contact tier (`job_tier`, 1–6) | "persona tier", "lead tier" |
| Demo mode | "webhook trigger", "demo flow" |
| Hard reject threshold | "kill threshold" |
| Working directory | "client folder", "client dir" |

---

## Provider Name Disambiguation

Several providers have similarly-named products. Be explicit about which is meant.

| Product | Skill | Purpose | Notes |
|---------|-------|---------|-------|
| **BetterContact Lead Finder** | people-search | Synchronous people discovery API | Returns contacts by company + role filters |
| **BetterContact async enrichment** | people-enrichment | Async email/phone enrichment | Slow due to multi-provider waterfall. Email hit rate is low (~14% in our tests) — **prefer FullEnrich for email**. Acceptable for phone if user has patience. |
| **FullEnrich Finder** | people-search | People discovery (returns LinkedIn URLs) | Required upstream of FullEnrich Enrich for email |
| **FullEnrich Enrich (v2)** | people-enrichment | Email + phone enrichment | Faster and more reliable than BC for email; has MCP support |
| **Pipe0 searches** | people-search, company-search | Discovery — finds new entities | `searches:profiles:*` |
| **Pipe0 pipes** | people-enrichment | Enrichment — augments existing entities | `pipes/run` waterfall |
