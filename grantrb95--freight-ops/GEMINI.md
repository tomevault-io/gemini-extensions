### What's Implemented

1. **`src/data/models/load.py`** - Fully implemented Load Pydantic model including:
   - Load status/type enums
   - Location model
   - Core Load model with all freight fields
   - Computed properties: `total_miles`, `deadhead_percentage`, `gross_revenue`, `rate_per_mile`, `all_miles_rate`, `trip_duration_hours`
   - Profitability check method: `is_profitable(min_rpm, max_deadhead_pct)`

2. **Configuration** - Fully set up:
   - `config/config.yaml` - Business rules for H-4 Strategic Solutions LLC (DOT# 4486526, MC# MC-1772833-C)
   - `config/llms.json` - LLM assignments per agent with fallback models
   - `.env.example` - All required API keys and settings documented

3. **Project tooling** - Configured in `pyproject.toml`:
   - Dependencies: anthropic, openai, langchain, mcp, pydantic, httpx, pandas, sqlalchemy, etc.
   - Dev tools: pytest, ruff, mypy, black
   - Entry points defined for CLI and agent commands

### What Needs Implementation

**Priority Order:**

1. **Base Agent Class** (`src/agents/base.py`)
   - MCP protocol integration
   - Tool registry access
   - Structured logging
   - Error handling patterns

2. **Core Infrastructure** (`src/core/`)
   - `config.py` - Configuration loader using dynaconf
   - `mcp_registry.py` - Tool discovery and management
   - `sandbox.py` - Secure execution environment (optional)

3. **Data Models** (`src/data/models/`) - Extend from Load model:
   - `route.py` - Route with waypoints, distances, timing
   - `rate.py` - Rate analysis and market data
   - `driver.py` - Driver info and equipment
   - `expense.py` - Fuel, tolls, maintenance tracking
   - `settlement.py` - Driver pay calculations

4. **AI Agents** (`src/agents/`)
   - `dispatch.py` - Load matching and booking
   - `rate_analysis.py` - Market rate analysis
   - `compliance.py` - IFTA, HOS, DOT compliance
   - `route_optimizer.py` - Deadhead reduction
   - `settlement.py` - Driver pay calculations

5. **MCP Tools** (`src/tools/`)
   - Load board integrations (DAT, Truckstop.com)
   - Mapping/routing tools
   - Financial calculators

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style and Quality

```bash
# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Install dev dependencies
uv sync --extra dev

# Lint and format
ruff check src/
ruff format src/

# Type checking
mypy src/

# Run tests
pytest tests/

# Run tests with coverage
pytest --cov=src tests/
```

### Python Standards

- **Python 3.12+** required
- Use **type hints everywhere** - this domain is complex, types help
- Use **Pydantic v2** for all data models (see `load.py` for patterns)
- Follow the **computed_field** pattern for derived values
- Use **Decimal** for all monetary values (never float)
- Use **Enum** classes for fixed choices (LoadStatus, LoadType)

### Adding New Data Models

Follow the pattern in `src/data/models/load.py`:

```python
from decimal import Decimal
from datetime import datetime
from typing import Optional
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field, computed_field

class MyModel(BaseModel):
    """Docstring explaining the model."""

    # Required fields with Field() for validation/description
    required_field: str = Field(..., description="What this field represents")

    # Optional fields with defaults
    optional_field: Optional[str] = None

    # Numeric validation
    positive_value: Decimal = Field(..., gt=0, description="Must be positive")

    @computed_field
    @property
    def derived_value(self) -> Decimal:
        """Computed property that appears in serialization."""
        return self.positive_value * 2
```

### Adding New Agents

Agents should follow this pattern (when base class is implemented):

```python
from src.agents.base import BaseAgent
from src.data.models import Load

class DispatchAgent(BaseAgent):
    """Dispatch agent for load matching and booking."""

    # Reference config/llms.json for model configuration
    agent_type = "dispatch"

    async def evaluate_load(self, load: Load) -> dict:
        """Evaluate a load for profitability."""
        # Log reasoning for human oversight
        self.log_decision(
            data_considered={"load_id": load.load_id, "rpm": load.rate_per_mile},
            thresholds_applied={"min_rpm": self.config.min_rpm},
            decision="accept" if load.is_profitable(...) else "reject",
            confidence=0.85
        )
```

### Configuration Access

Use the business config from `config/config.yaml`:

```python
# Access configuration values
company_name = config.company.name  # "H-4 Strategic Solutions LLC"
min_rpm = config.rates.minimum_rate_per_mile  # 2.00
max_deadhead = config.rates.max_deadhead_percentage  # 20
home_base = config.home_base  # Fort Gibson, OK
```

### LLM Model Selection

Reference `config/llms.json` for agent-specific models:

- **Dispatch**: Claude 3.5 Sonnet (temp 0.2) - analytical reasoning
- **Rate Analysis**: Claude 3.5 Sonnet (temp 0.1) - precise calculations
- **Compliance**: Claude 3.5 Sonnet (temp 0.0) - maximum accuracy
- **Route Optimizer**: Claude 3.5 Sonnet (temp 0.3) - creative solutions
- **Settlement**: Claude 3.5 Sonnet (temp 0.0) - financial accuracy
- **Monitoring**: Claude 3.5 Haiku - fast, low-cost
- **General Query**: Claude 3.5 Haiku - efficient

## Freight Domain Knowledge

### Key Concepts

**Rate Per Mile (RPM)**
- Gross revenue divided by loaded miles
- Minimum target for H-4: $2.00/mile
- Target: $2.50/mile
- Premium: $3.00/mile
- Always include fuel surcharge and accessorials

**Deadhead**
- Empty miles driven to pickup or after delivery
- Maximum threshold for H-4: 20% or 150 miles
- Calculate: `(deadhead_miles / total_miles) * 100`
- Critical for profitability - a high-paying load with long deadhead may be worse than lower-paying nearby load

**IFTA (International Fuel Tax Agreement)**
- Track fuel purchases and miles by jurisdiction
- Required for quarterly reporting
- Home state for H-4: Oklahoma
- Penalties for non-compliance are severe

**Driver Settlement**
- Calculate based on percentage or per-mile rate
- Deduct advances, fuel card purchases, insurance
- Must comply with owner-operator agreements

**Hotshot Trucking Specifics**
- Lighter loads (typically Class 3-5 trucks)
- Focus on speed and flexibility over maximum payload
- H-4 equipment: 2025 Dodge Ram 3500, 40ft gooseneck flatbed
- Max payload: 22,500 lbs (air-ride gooseneck — premium selling point for damage-sensitive freight)
- Preferred operating area: OK, TX, AR, KS, MO, LA (1000 mile radius)

### Operating Costs (H-4 Configuration)

- Fuel cost: $3.50/gallon
- MPG: 9
- Cost per mile: $0.39
- Maintenance reserve: $0.10/mile
- Insurance: $1,500/month
- Truck payment: $1,200/month
- Trailer payment: $400/month

## API Integrations

### Load Boards

- **DAT**: Primary load board, RateView for market rates
- **Truckstop.com**: Secondary load board
- Both require authentication and have rate limits
- Implement exponential backoff for API failures
- Cache frequently accessed data

### Required Environment Variables

Critical ones (see `.env.example` for full list):
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` - Primary LLM provider
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - Fallback LLM provider
- `DAT_API_KEY`, `DAT_API_SECRET` - DAT Load Board
- `TRUCKSTOP_API_KEY` - Truckstop.com
- `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` - Route optimization
- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection

## Testing Guidelines

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest tests/

# Run with verbose output
pytest -v tests/

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/agents/test_dispatch.py

# Run tests matching pattern
pytest -k "test_load"
```

### Test Patterns

- Use mock data for load board responses (avoid API costs)
- Test edge cases: no available loads, extreme rates, multi-stop routes
- Validate compliance calculations against known correct values
- Test agent decision-making with historical load data
- Use pytest markers: `@pytest.mark.unit`, `@pytest.mark.integration`, `@pytest.mark.api`

## Best Practices

1. **Always validate load data** - Brokers sometimes post incorrect info
2. **Consider total trip profitability** - Not just loaded miles
3. **Factor in realistic transit times** - Speed limits, HOS rules, loading times
4. **Implement circuit breakers** - Don't hammer APIs when they're down
5. **Log all agent decisions** - Critical for debugging and improvement
6. **Use type hints everywhere** - This is a complex domain, types help
7. **Document business logic** - Rate calculations, compliance rules, etc.
8. **Avoid over-engineering** - Keep solutions simple and focused

## Known Issues

1. **`config/config.yaml`** has extraneous content starting at line 80 (appears to be copy-pasted instructions that should be removed)

## Integration with open-ptc-agent

This project is designed to work alongside open-ptc-agent for advanced agent capabilities:
- Use MCP protocol for tool standardization
- Share context through structured data models
- Coordinate multi-agent workflows for complex operations
- Compatible with Claude Desktop and other MCP clients
