# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization

This repository is a Rust skeleton for `relay-knowledge`, a graph-database-based knowledge graph project. The root contains Cargo metadata, contributor docs, pre-commit configuration, and GitHub Actions workflow files.

Use the existing Rust layout:

- `Cargo.toml`: package manifest and Rust lint configuration.
- `src/relay_knowledge/lib.rs`: reusable knowledge graph primitives and the Cargo library entry point.
- `src/relay_knowledge/main.rs`: default CLI entry point.
- `tests/`: integration and smoke tests.
- `docs/zh/03-architecture-specs/02-engineering-hard-constraints.md`: hard constraints for shallow functions, dead code, documentation completeness, foundational modules, acyclic dependencies, max file length, unit-test coverage, event-driven HTTP, QoS, and Playwright Chromium browser integration-test readiness.
- `docs/zh/03-architecture-specs/19-installation-release-and-upgrade.md`: installation, packaging, publishing, service deployment, upgrade, and uninstall requirements.
- `.github/workflows/pr-checks.yml`: CI quality gates.

Keep generated output, build products, and large temporary data out of version control.

CodeSpec map: codespec/codespec-map.yaml
Knowledge map: knowledge/knowledge-map.yaml

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

- `cargo build`: compile the project.
- `cargo check --all-targets --all-features`: run the fast type/build gate without final code generation.
- `cargo test --all-targets --all-features`: run unit and integration tests.
- `cargo fmt --all -- --check`: verify formatting without rewriting files.
- `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`: run lint checks and fail on warnings.
- `cargo run`: run the default binary.
- `cargo package`: verify the crate contents that would be published to crates.io.
- `cargo publish --dry-run`: validate the center-repository publishing path without publishing.
- `python3 tools/docs/check_docs.py`: validate documentation structure, local links and anchors, code fences, chapter numbering, indexes, and English-edition translation hygiene.
- `./setup.sh` or `setup.bat`: install/check the Rust toolchain, set up hooks, and run quality gates.
- `pre-commit run --all-files`: run the local quality hooks.
- `./check.sh --deep`: after installing nightly `miri` and `rust-src`, run the deterministic benchmark, FFI-free Miri core-domain tests, and AddressSanitizer in addition to the standard local gates.

Document required services, such as graph databases or local containers, in `README.md` and commit example configuration files.

## Architecture Constraints

- Build the project as event-driven and async-first from the beginning. New I/O, graph database access, indexing, ingestion, and service orchestration should expose async APIs.
- Do not add blocking work to async execution paths. If blocking CPU or filesystem work is unavoidable, isolate it behind explicit worker boundaries.
- Use bounded queues, backpressure, timeouts, and cancellation for event pipelines so ingestion or query spikes cannot grow without control.
- Keep graph storage, event transport, and domain logic separated behind small interfaces. Tests should be able to exercise domain behavior without a live database.
- Prefer observable workflows: important events should carry enough structured context for logging, tracing, retries, and debugging.
- Provide both CLI and Web usage modes. They must share the same core services and domain APIs so behavior does not diverge between interfaces.
- Provide three-layer retrieval from the start: keyword BM25, semantic retrieval, and vector retrieval. Retrieval indexes and answers must stay tied to the latest graph state, with explicit refresh, versioning, or invalidation when graph data changes.
- Treat installed background operation as a first-class runtime. Long-running graph refresh, indexing, maintenance, and diagnostics should be hosted by the platform service manager (systemd, Windows Service, or launchd) rather than an unmanaged CLI loop.
- Silent background updates must be user-configurable, observable, and reversible. They may refresh graph data and derived indexes only within authorized scopes, and must expose freshness, stale, paused, degraded, and failure states.
- Background pipelines must use bounded queues, resource budgets, backpressure, timeouts, cancellation, retry backoff, persistent cursors or leases, and dead-letter handling so spikes cannot consume unbounded CPU, memory, or disk.
- CPU-heavy or disk-heavy work such as embedding, OCR, large-file parsing, full index rebuilds, WAL checkpointing, and compaction must run behind explicit worker or maintenance boundaries and must not block query hot paths or async runtime executors.
- Design ingestion, indexing, and maintenance for crash recovery and hung-task recovery. Startup reconcilers should replay missed index refresh work, recover expired task leases, report index lag, and keep graph facts and derived indexes consistent by version.
- Do not fix code-index SQLite contention by killing competing `relay-knowledge` processes, adding unmanaged background loops, bypassing task leases/checkpoints, or increasing busy timeouts without a bound. Duplicate or overlapping repository index work must be represented as durable tasks with attempt-scoped leases, bounded retry/backoff, observable checkpoint/status, and at most one active writer task per repository.
- Do not fix slow large-repository registration or cold indexing by skipping indexing stages, disabling FTS/search-document writes, omitting edge finalization, weakening freshness checks, hiding stale/degraded states, or returning success before durable checkpointed work is complete.
- Do not fix large-repository indexing performance by hard-coding repository names, paths, symbols, query text, fixture ids, or benchmark case ids in product code.
- Do not fix large-repository indexing performance by making queues, batches, blob materialization, parser workers, SQLite transactions, retry windows, or source-fallback candidate sets unbounded.
- Do not fix large-repository indexing performance by moving Git blob reads, parser work, SQLite writes, FTS rebuilds, or edge finalization onto async executor hot paths.
- Do not accept code-index performance changes unless they preserve durable task leases, checkpoint replay/idempotency, at most one active writer task per repository, bounded retry/backoff, and observable progress/status.
- Do not accept code-index performance changes unless `tools/self_iteration` fast or `--categories performance` contains a case or metric that would fail if the same regression returns.
- Follow `docs/zh/03-architecture-specs/02-engineering-hard-constraints.md` as a hard architecture contract, not optional guidance.
- Do not introduce circular dependencies between crates, modules, traits, services, adapters, or configuration objects. Keep the dependency graph acyclic; when two modules need shared types or behavior, extract the contract into the lower layer or a narrowly scoped contract module.
- Provide foundational modules with strict ownership boundaries: `env` owns environment variable loading/parsing/validation, `paths` owns platform paths and runtime directories, and `net` owns all network capabilities including HTTP.
- Do not read environment variables outside `env`, do not construct runtime/config/data/log/cache paths outside `paths`, and do not create sockets, HTTP clients, HTTP servers, listeners, or network loops outside `net`, except for tightly scoped tests or bootstrap code with documented reasons.
- HTTP must live under `net::http` and be implemented through non-blocking operating-system event mechanisms such as epoll, kqueue, or IOCP through a mature async runtime or HTTP library. Do not implement HTTP with blocking sockets, one-thread-per-connection designs, busy polling, or unmanaged background loops.
- Network and HTTP entry points must support high-concurrency operation with bounded memory, connection budgets, request budgets, timeouts, cancellation, backpressure, graceful shutdown, and observability for connection counts, queue depth, drops, rate limits, and timeouts.
- Provide a `net::qos` module for admission control, per-source or per-tenant limits, priorities, resource budgets, overload behavior, and QoS metrics. All inbound and outbound network work must pass through QoS policy before consuming unbounded resources.
- Treat high performance and retrieval accuracy as algorithm and architecture problems, not as isolated fixture fixes. Improvements must generalize through better data structures, ranking signals, indexing strategy, query planning, batching, concurrency boundaries, or storage layout. Do not solve benchmark or eval failures by enumerating known queries, paths, repositories, symbols, or other narrow special cases unless the enumeration is a documented product contract with tests and maintenance guidance.
- Do not treat missing external dependency source as parser, index, file, scope, or response degradation. External packages, headers, modules, submodules, generated SDKs, and cross-repository targets that are not part of the authorized indexed scope must be exposed as unresolved edge metadata such as `resolution_state` and `target_hint`, not as `degraded_reason`.
- Recover C/C++ parser errors as `parsed` only when the file still has real structured facts and every error is isolated to a known-safe shape such as macro expansion, a bounded preprocessor directive, explicit template instantiation, a decorator-bearing type declaration, or GCC/Clang-style declaration attributes and inline extensions (`__attribute__`, `attribute`, `always_inline`, `__always_inline`) on otherwise declaration-shaped functions. Do not let arbitrary broken code inside a conditional preprocessor block or function body suppress partial diagnostics.
- Missing compiler/SDK headers such as `securec.h` and missing custom external types/macros such as PascalCase SDK types must remain unresolved import/reference metadata when they are outside the authorized indexed scope. Do not special-case real SDK paths or names in product code, and do not convert those coverage gaps into `degraded_reason`.
- Prefer structured code graph evidence over grep/text fallback. Use bounded `rg` fallback only to fill a specific source-text recall gap after indexed graph/lexical layers run; do not use grep fallback to mask recoverable parser behavior, missing dependency coverage, stale indexes, authorization gaps, or fixture-specific ranking gaps.

## Release & Installation Constraints

- Treat installation and deployment as first-class product surfaces. New user-facing capabilities must consider install, upgrade, rollback, uninstall, service operation, and diagnostics.
- Stable releases must prioritize convenient user installation: publish prebuilt cross-platform binaries, checksums, and release notes through GitHub Releases, and keep `cargo install relay-knowledge` working through crates.io.
- Installation paths must be short, versioned, verifiable, and reversible. Installers should support explicit version selection, install directory selection, service installation, dry-run, and safe rollback after partial failure.
- Keep binary installation separate from runtime state. Configuration, graph databases, indexes, logs, caches, temporary files, and dead-letter data must use documented platform directories, not the repository, current working directory, or release extraction directory unless the user explicitly configures that.
- Service installation must use the platform service manager: systemd on Linux, Windows Service on Windows, and launchd on macOS. Do not implement long-running background operation as an unmanaged CLI loop.
- Package manager manifests such as Homebrew, Scoop, winget, or distro packages should reference artifacts produced from the same release tag rather than rebuilding divergent snapshots.
- Any change that affects packaging, release artifacts, service templates, data directories, configuration, migration, upgrade, or uninstall behavior must update `docs/zh/03-architecture-specs/19-installation-release-and-upgrade.md` and any affected README or release-note guidance.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

Use idiomatic Rust conventions: four-space indentation, `snake_case` for functions/modules, `PascalCase` for types and traits, and `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` for constants. Keep `unsafe` out of the codebase unless explicitly justified. Run `cargo fmt` before committing Rust code.

Configuration and documentation files should use descriptive names, for example `docs/graph-schema.md` or `examples/load_dataset.rs`.

Delete empty or meaningless placeholder files instead of keeping them in the module tree. This includes 0-byte files, whitespace-only files, and files that contain only placeholder comments without a real module responsibility. Required Cargo or Rust module entry points, such as `src/relay_knowledge/lib.rs`, are not considered empty when they declare the crate/module surface.

Keep project identity constants centralized in `src/relay_knowledge/project/mod.rs`. Product names, application directory names, database filenames, service definition filenames, and similar `relay-knowledge` identity strings should be added there and referenced from feature modules rather than duplicated in `paths`, `application`, `interfaces`, or adapters. Module-local operational defaults, such as HTTP, QoS, parser, storage, or indexing limits, should stay with the module that owns their behavior.

Agent-facing skill and documentation command examples must be shell-specific. Do not place Windows `.exe`, drive-letter, or `assets/windows-*` commands in bash, sh, POSIX, or unlabeled code blocks. Put Windows examples only in PowerShell or cmd.exe blocks, and keep POSIX examples on POSIX binaries such as `assets/linux-x86_64/relay-knowledge` or a POSIX `PATH` install.

Do not add shallow functions. A function must enforce an invariant, perform meaningful validation/transformation, isolate an external boundary, manage resource lifecycle, map errors, add observability, or coordinate a real workflow. Prefer constants, typed config, or direct calls over pass-through wrappers that only rename another call.

Do not add or keep dead code. Remove unused modules, functions, types, fields, feature flags, fixtures, commented-out implementations, TODO stubs, and speculative extension points. New public APIs need a production caller or a documented spec-backed extension point with tests. Do not hide dead code with `#[allow(dead_code)]` or similar attributes except for generated/platform/protocol cases with an explicit removal condition.

Documentation completeness is mandatory. Every code, configuration, behavior, test harness, workflow, benchmark, packaging, release, installation, or operations change must include the matching documentation refresh in the same change set. Update README guidance, architecture specs, installation/release notes, benchmark notes, examples, CLI help/spec docs, or contributor docs as appropriate; if no user-facing or maintainer-facing document is affected, state that explicitly in the PR/change summary. Do not leave documentation refresh as a follow-up task.

Self-iteration and benchmark changes must protect general behavior. When adding or fixing cases for C/C++ macros, dependency coverage, grep fallback, or parser degradation, improve parser extraction, edge metadata, ranking, candidate windows, or index structures; do not enumerate known queries, paths, repositories, dependency names, symbols, or fixture strings in product code.

## Testing Guidelines

Place unit tests next to the code they exercise using `#[cfg(test)]`. Put cross-module tests in `tests/`. Name tests after observable behavior, such as `creates_node_when_entity_is_new`.

For graph/database behavior, prefer deterministic fixtures and isolate tests from developer-local state. If tests require an external service, provide setup instructions and sensible defaults.

Tests for foundational modules must cover environment parsing errors, platform path resolution, network timeout/backpressure behavior, QoS admission/limit decisions, and HTTP cancellation or graceful shutdown where applicable.

Unit-test line coverage must stay above 90%. Use `cargo llvm-cov` or an equivalent auditable coverage gate for Rust, and add focused unit tests for invariants, error branches, boundary values, and async cancellation/backpressure behavior instead of relying on broad integration tests.

Keep routine commit checks on the stable toolchain: Cargo check, Clippy, and all-target tests are pre-commit gates. Miri and AddressSanitizer are required pull-request jobs and explicit `./check.sh --deep` gates because they require nightly and instrumented rebuilds. Miri covers the FFI-free `domain::core::` invariants; SQLite, network, and other host boundaries remain covered by normal tests and the native Linux AddressSanitizer job.

Testing must be layered for the whole project: keep a distinct UT gate and a distinct integration-test gate. The integration-test gate must mirror the `relay-teams` browser pattern by installing Playwright Chromium, for example `uv run --extra dev python -m playwright install --with-deps chromium`, before browser integration tests and failing CI when browser setup or integration tests fail.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

Use short, imperative commit subjects, for example `Add graph schema loader` or `Document local database setup`.

Pull requests should include a summary, reason for the change, test results, and configuration or migration notes. Link related issues when available. Include screenshots only for UI or documentation rendering changes.

## Security & Configuration Tips

Do not commit secrets, database credentials, private datasets, or local environment files. Commit safe templates such as `.env.example` when configuration is required. Prefer explicit environment variables and document them in `README.md`.
