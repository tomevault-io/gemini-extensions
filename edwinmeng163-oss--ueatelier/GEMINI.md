# UEAtelier Agent Handoff

This is the first-read briefing for AI agents. It keeps only core identity,
read-order, freshness, tool-count, file-inventory, and safety rules. Deep
operational guidance lives in `Docs/agents-guide/`.

## Project Identity

UEAtelier is an Unreal Editor MCP self-extension workbench. The main
deliverable is `Plugins/UnrealMcp`. The plugin runs inside Unreal Editor,
exposes `http://127.0.0.1:8765/mcp`, adds `Window > UEAtelier Chat`, adds
`Window > UEAtelier Workbench`, and exposes Task Atlas from the Chat panel.

Current plugin metadata:

```text
Plugins/UnrealMcp/UnrealMcp.uplugin
FriendlyName: UEAtelier
VersionName: 0.35.0
EngineVersion: intentionally omitted for cross-version source builds
Type: Editor plugin
Required plugin: PythonScriptPlugin
```

The v0.35 source line prioritizes Unreal Engine 5.7 and 5.8. UE 5.6 remains a
maintenance compile canary during the transition, not a primary release gate.
`UEvolve.uproject` is the local development host and defaults to
`EngineAssociation` `5.7`. `Examples/UEvolveExample57` (UE 5.7.4) is the
primary sample-content host and is also built/tested with UE 5.8; the full
`Examples/UEvolveExample` host remains the UE 5.6 maintenance canary. Do not
add a duplicate multi-gigabyte UE 5.8 content host.

Multi-engine discipline:

- All `#if ENGINE_*_VERSION` goes in `UnrealMcpEngineCompat.h`.
- Before switching the shared `Examples/UEvolveExample57` host between UE 5.7
  and UE 5.8, delete both the plugin and host `Binaries/` and `Intermediate/`
  directories. Partial platform/build-subdirectory cleanup is insufficient.
- Run `Tools/install_git_hooks.sh` once after clone.
- `EAiProviderKind` values are append-only; do not renumber.

## Product Goal

Target:

```text
An Unreal Editor MCP self-extension workbench that lets AI add new editor
automation capabilities under audit, dry run, backup, build, test, rollback,
RAG, and long-memory safeguards.
```

Core capabilities: call Unreal Editor tools from Chat or external MCP clients;
inspect maps, assets, actors, Blueprint graphs, Widget trees, logs, tests,
metadata, memory, skills, and knowledge cards; edit Blueprint, Widget, and
Actor state through fixed schemas; scaffold, validate, dry run, apply, build,
test, classify, and roll back new MCP tools; use RAG/tool recommendation before
creating tools; write project memory; distill repeated work into skills.

## Read Order For A New Agent

Start with `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, `Plugins/UnrealMcp/README.md`,
`Docs/Architecture.md`, and `Docs/SecurityModel.md`.

Then read on demand:

| Task type | Read next |
|---|---|
| Architecture or module split | `Docs/Architecture.md` |
| RAG, knowledge search, recommendation | `Docs/KnowledgeRag.md`, `Tools/UnrealMcpKnowledge/README.md`, `Tools/UnrealMcpKnowledge/Evals/core_rag_eval.json` |
| Security or path safety | `Docs/SecurityModel.md` |
| Code file editing (read/search/preview/apply/rollback) | `Docs/CodeTools.md`, `Docs/agents-guide/code-tools.md` |
| Python user-tool composition with core tools | `Docs/CallTool.md`, `Docs/agents-guide/call-tool.md`, `Docs/SecurityModel.md` |
| Self-extension, scaffolds, audit, rollback, supervisor recovery | `Docs/agents-guide/self-extension.md`, `Docs/SelfExtensionPipeline.md`, `Tools/UnrealMcpSkills/mcp-self-extension/SKILL.md` |
| Task Atlas lifecycle, schemas, clustering, promotion | `Docs/agents-guide/task-atlas.md`, `Docs/TaskAtlas.md` |
| Automation tests, PIE smoke, editor diagnostics | `Docs/agents-guide/verification.md`, `Docs/Verification.md` |
| Build, release, packaging, install, deployment | `Docs/agents-guide/packaging.md`, `Docs/DeploymentTroubleshooting.md`, `Plugins/UnrealMcp/README.md`, `Tools/install_unrealmcp_to_project.py` |
| Windows compatibility or Win packaging | `Docs/agents-guide/packaging.md`, `Docs/WindowsCompatibilityLessons.md`, `Docs/WindowsPackaging.md`, `Docs/Stage2WindowsVerify.md`, `Tools/package_plugin.ps1` |
| Build hygiene or packaging-script pitfalls | `Docs/agents-guide/packaging.md`, `Docs/BuildAndPackagingPitfalls.md` |
| Tool changes | `Tools/UnrealMcpToolRegistry/tools.json`, `Plugins/UnrealMcp/Source/UnrealMcp/Private/UnrealMcpToolRegistrar.cpp`, then the category source file |

## Documentation Freshness Rule

After every meaningful project change, update the AI-facing docs before
handoff:

1. Update `AGENTS.md` when project structure, tool-extension workflow, safety
   rules, build/test commands, RAG behavior, or current project status changes.
2. Update `README.md` when user-facing install, usage, feature coverage,
   deployment, or product positioning changes.
3. Update the focused doc under `Docs/` when the change belongs to a specific
   system such as architecture, self-extension, RAG, security, supervisor, or
   deployment troubleshooting.
4. If the change adds or changes tools, update ToolRegistry metadata, tests, and
   relevant docs in the same patch.

Treat stale docs as a product bug.

## Current High-Level Feature Set

- Editor/inspection: status, engine version, settings, player input
  configuration, logs, maps, assets, selection, PIE, console, Python,
  Content Browser sync, save dirty packages, asset move, redirector fixup,
  dependency remap, and migration helpers.
- Actor, Blueprint, Widget, and Material tools: readback, guarded edits,
  creation, layout, graph/pin inspection, gameplay node/input event authoring,
  Blueprint SCS component/default edits, map GameMode setup, actor auto-possess,
  parameter inspection, and strict schema writes.
- Code tools: workspace policy status, bounded file listing, file readback with
  whole-file sha, bounded literal/regex/filename search, and v0.29 Wave B
  preview/apply/rollback write closure with byte-exact sha checks, backups,
  manifests, locks, drift detection, and rollback.
- Self-extension: schema/C++ patch validation, Python user-extension scaffolds,
  `unreal.mcp_user_registry_reload`, `unreal.mcp_user_tool_smoke`, patch
  editing, dry-run apply, backups, build matrix, tests, pipeline, audit,
  rollback, locks, error classification, supervisor install, and reviewed
  package export/import.
- Python user-tool composition: registered user tools receive injected
  `call_tool` / `call_tool_raw` helpers that route through the UFUNCTION
  `unreal.UnrealMcpCallTool.call_tool` into visible core `unreal.*` tools with
  allow / force-dry-run / deny policy; a verified vetted-toolset marker may
  allow real core writes only inside the live hash-checked toolset scope with
  fail-closed `vetted_real_write` audit. Task Atlas grants vetting only through
  an in-editor human approval flow with source-policy validation,
  vetted-context smoke, persisted marker, and fail-closed audit. Depth=1 and
  `user.*` targets remain forbidden.
- RAG/recommendation, memory, skills, Task Atlas, and verification:
  KnowledgeIndex v2 with staged/verified replacement and recoverable
  last-known-good backup pairs,
  `missing|empty|stale|ready|corrupt` status, source/engine counts and hashes;
  boundary-aware/version-aware lexical search, source-kind/engine diversity,
  rank-aware evals, tool/workflow recommend, project memory CRUD,
  skill activity/drafts/promote, task extract/list/describe/rate/pin/promote,
  schema v2 ordered Task Atlas stepRefs with preview composite generation from
  private captured args, MCP wrappers for making/listing/deleting/smoking
  Task Atlas generated tools, RAG promotion, and user-registry introspection,
  `unreal.automation_list`, `unreal.automation_run`,
  `unreal.automation_report`, `unreal.pie_smoke`,
  `unreal.verify_player_controls`, `unreal.pie_input_probe`,
  `unreal.verify_viewport_widgets`, and `unreal.editor_diagnostics`.

## Tool Registry Status

The explicit ToolRegistry is central. Do not bypass it:
`Tools/UnrealMcpToolRegistry/tools.json`,
`Plugins/UnrealMcp/Resources/ToolRegistry/tools.json`,
`Tools/UnrealMcpToolRegistry/schema.json`, and
`Schemas/UnrealMcpToolRegistry.schema.json`.

At the time this file was written, the registry contained 190 entries across:
actors, blueprint, code, editor, material, memory, scaffold, self-extension,
skills, task-atlas, verification, and widget.

Recent v0.14-v0.24 project work includes Python runtime smoke,
readback inspectors, Blueprint refactor and macro/interface tools, UBT target
matrix, migration tools, install doctor, UMG/material parity tools, Task Atlas
foundation/backfill tools, verification foundation tools, diagnostics, PIE
smoke, AI provider presets, Kimi `reasoning_content` compatibility, enriched
input schemas, generated per-tool docs under `Tools/UnrealMcpToolDocs/`, and
the `Tools/UEAtelierCli/` CLI-Anything package. v0.31 R4 chunk 9 adds
CLI <-> Chat Panel sync tools (chat_inject_user_input, chat_history_tail,
chat_tool_log_tail) and hardens Task Atlas eligibility against external-client
registry-miss noise.

Current project status: v0.35.0 is the current public release (2026-07-14),
shipped as Batch 1 of the dual-variant v0.35 plan; variant structure and
optional official-MCP integration remain a later batch. Trilingual notes at
`Docs/Release-2026-07b.md`. UE 5.7 and
UE 5.8 are the primary support targets; both clean-build the current source,
and both pass the new RAG 17/17, Gate D 1/1, EngineCompat 2/2, and project
version migration 1/1 suites. Both primary engines also pass the v0.34 safety
baselines: VetMadeTool 11/11, VettedToolset 5/5, CallTool 9/9, and TaskAtlas
38/38. The RAG
P0/P1 batch isolates Gate D from the production index, prevents zero-card
refresh from replacing last-known-good state, writes/validates Index v2
hash/freshness metadata, makes ActivityLog indexing opt-in, separates promoted
markdown from official-doc toggles, preserves UE 5.7/5.8 metadata/headings,
fixes `ui`-inside-`build` and version-token ranking, reserves source/engine
diversity under the card cap, adds rank-aware eval assertions, and confines
RAG roots, recursive scans, manifest `textPath` reads, fixed index leaves,
eval files, and source-fingerprint metadata probes without following symlinks
or reparse points. R1 adds interruption recovery, deterministic CJK/Latin
tokenization, known-engine-only numeric filtering, isolated `allowEmptyIndex`,
Chat refresh backoff, skipped-HTML cleanup, and Windows CI hardening. Unchanged
warm index reads use cards/manifest size and timestamp metadata to bypass pair
recovery, hashing, and JSONL parsing; cold or changed pairs still run full
recovery and verification. The root host now targets 5.7;
`project_version_migration` accepts primary 5.7/5.8 and
maintenance 5.6. Registry count stays 190 and validation is 190/190. Detailed
development notes are in `Docs/Development-0.35.md`.

Previous public release status: v0.34.0 (2026-07-02) ships the Make-Tool-Set
vetting foundation plus the Codex bridge workspace-write network fix. Task
Atlas generated composites (`user.atlas_*`) can be approved in-editor with
"Approve real writes" and then execute their dangerous `call_tool` steps for
real without per-run confirmation, while wire/MCP clients cannot grant that
authority. Approval is fail-closed through source-policy validation (closed
imports, no dynamic access/reflection, no direct Unreal usage, no file IO),
manifest allowlist subset checks, live `main.py` SHA-256 binding, a real
vetted-context test run, TOCTOU hash re-check, atomic marker write, registry
reload, and audited `toolset_vetted` persistence; revocation is fail-safe and
every vetted real write emits sanitized `vetted_real_write` audit. The four
structural hard denies remain non-overridable: hidden tools, user-to-user
calls, call-tool depth, and workflow_run. Made-tools UI and
`unreal.user_registry_introspect` now report vetted marker/hash/approver
status, and the bridge sets workspace-write `network_access=true` so
in-editor AI can reach `http://127.0.0.1:8765/mcp`. Version 0.33 was an
internal UE5.8 validation track and is not a public release. Tool count stays
190 (visible tools/list count stays 178); UE 5.6 + 5.7 dual-engine builds
pass; VetMadeTool 11/11, VettedToolset 5/5, CallTool 9/9, TaskAtlas 38/38,
and registry validation 190/190 pass; full-host automation converges to the
two known baseline failures. Trilingual notes at `Docs/Release-2026-07.md`.

Earlier project status: v0.32.2 (2026-06-11) is an MCP protocol conformance
patch on v0.32.1. codex-cli 0.132 moved its MCP client to the official rmcp
0.15 Rust SDK, whose strict untagged-result parsing mis-read our tools/list
response — it carried a non-spec top-level `structuredContent`
`{toolsListVersion}` — as a CallToolResult, failing MCP client startup with
"MCP startup failed: Unexpected response type" and hiding every unreal.*
tool from codex sessions. The patch strips that field (the chat panel reads
the version counter in-process; no wire consumer existed) and pins the wire
with two guardrail layers: pure UnrealMcp::Protocol response builders
(UnrealMcpProtocolBuilders.h) backed by five exact-key UnrealMcp.Protocol.*
Automation tests (initialize / ping / tools-list with an explicit
structuredContent-absent regression pin / tool-call / JSON-RPC envelopes),
plus an official @modelcontextprotocol/sdk conformance smoke
(Tools/UnrealMcpCodexBridge/test-sdk-conformance.ts, devDependency-only)
wired into the Stage 2 release SOP as a required gate. The bridge README
gains a tested-client matrix (codex-cli 0.130.0 probe line; 0.132.0 / rmcp
0.15 current verified line) with a Codex-Desktop auto-update caveat. The
stale UnrealMcp.UserToolListVersion wire test flipped to assert omission.
Tool count stays 190 (visible tools/list count stays 178); UE 5.6 + 5.7
dual-engine builds pass and full automation converges to the two known
failures (RunRecoversStale, PieSmoke.MapValidation). Trilingual notes at
`Docs/Release-2026-06c.md`.

Earlier project status: v0.32.1 (2026-06-10) is a platform-coverage patch
on v0.32.0. The Codex CLI subprocess provider now works on Windows: direct
codex.exe spawn with no shell intermediary, MSVC CRT-quoted argv (UE
auto-quotes the URL so the builder excludes the binary path), .exe-only
binary validation rejecting npm .cmd/.bat shims and WindowsApps store paths,
a 30000-TCHAR full-command-line guard, and the three ChatPanel Windows UI
gates removed; the POSIX path is byte-identical (stash-contrast verified).
The release also ships a dev-host automation baseline cleanup (committed
tool.json manifest for user.editor_python_runtime_info, GateD sourceRoot
fixture isolation, ExecCommandActualBashExec relative-path root-cause fix,
stale count expectations refreshed, CountSeparation made baseline-relative).
Tool count stays 190; UE 5.6 + 5.7 dual-engine builds pass and full
automation on both dev and example hosts converges to the two known
failures (RunRecoversStale, PieSmoke.MapValidation). Trilingual notes at
`Docs/Release-2026-06b.md`.

Earlier project status: v0.32.0 (2026-06-02) was the stable release after a
9-chunk rework of Task Atlas Make Tool Set + CLI ↔ editor chat sync. The
rework added 9 new MCP tools (6 task_atlas_* wrappers in chunk 5 +
chat_inject_user_input/chat_history_tail/chat_tool_log_tail in chunk 9),
introduced the `UnrealMcp::TaskAtlasService` backend namespace, switched
STaskAtlasWindow handlers to thin invokers (net -483 LOC) with Test Now /
Debug buttons and blocked-task disable + tooltip, added the
`toolsListVersion` ETag on tools/list for external polling, and hardened
the protocol against external-client stale-`task_list` poisoning (Fix B
in `UnrealMcpProtocol.cpp` + Fix C in `UnrealMcpTaskAtlasService.cpp`).
Tool count 181 → 190; 63/63 automation pass (49 baseline + 14 ChatSync);
UE 5.6 + 5.7 dual-engine build pass; trilingual release notes at
`Docs/Release-2026-06.md`; mac + win zip on GitHub release v0.32.0.
Eligibility-based product split: `preview_ready` writes PyTools + explicit
Test Now (no auto-smoke); `partial` / `skeleton_pre_capture` write markdown
only at `Saved/UnrealMcp/TaskAtlasDrafts/`; `blocked` UI disables Make Tool
Set with tooltip showing first blocked step + reason. R6 end-to-end GUI
demo verified CLI ↔ editor chat sync: CLI-injected prompts appear in
editor Chat Panel, AI's real responses + tool log show in editor, and
`chat_history_tail` / `chat_tool_log_tail` return data byte-identical to
what editor displays.

Earlier project status: v0.31 Stage 2 was complete through Wave E docs:
ActivityLog records now carry `eventId` plus public capture metadata; tool
arguments are redacted for secret fields, home/project paths, per-tool skip
rules, and size caps before optional storage in private
`Saved/UnrealMcp/CapturedToolArgs`; Task Atlas task JSON uses schema v2 ordered
non-deduped `stepRefs` with `replayEligibility`; and `Make Tool Set` generates
honest preview or skeleton composite Python user tools with sanitized captured
defaults, per-step `policyDecision`, `isError`, and force-dry-run
`effectiveArgsDiff` while avoiding any promise of real replay; v0.30 R2 Wave C
makes Task Atlas `Make Tool Set` generate skeleton composite Python user tools
directly under the user registry from visible core `unreal.*` critical-path
steps, writing closed `tool.json` schemas, `pythonHandlerSha256`, `smokeArgs`,
then running user-registry reload and smoke while preserving the then-current
core registry count; v0.30 R2 Wave B
adds Python user-tool `call_tool` / `call_tool_raw` builtins over
`unreal.UnrealMcpCallTool.call_tool`, enabling fail-closed composition of
visible core `unreal.*` tools; v0.29 Wave B implements the `code` category with
seven visible core code tools: four read-only tools
`unreal.code_workspace_status`, `unreal.code_list_files`,
`unreal.code_read_file`, and `unreal.code_search`, plus write-closure tools
`unreal.code_preview_change`, `unreal.code_apply_change`, and
`unreal.code_rollback_change`; v0.28 adds eight visible core gameplay authoring tools:
`unreal.bp_add_input_axis_event_node`,
`unreal.bp_add_input_action_event_node`, `unreal.bp_add_component`,
`unreal.bp_set_component_property`, `unreal.bp_set_class_default`,
`unreal.bp_add_gameplay_node`, `unreal.editor_set_map_game_mode`, and
`unreal.actor_set_auto_possess`, plus runtime verification tools
`unreal.pie_input_probe` and `unreal.verify_viewport_widgets`; v0.27.1 adds
core player input configuration, now including arbitrary legacy axis/action
names, and existence-only player control verification; v0.27 walls core apply/pipeline off from the AI,
makes AI self-extension the Python user-tool track only, keeps core promotion
manual/developer-only and deferred, adds a `workflow_run` hidden-tool guard, and
merges the three project skills into `mcp-self-extension`; v0.26 completes
Reform C with centralized server-message provider system prompt assembly, six
baked safety rules, the AssistantRun approval gate, Python user-extension
default scaffolds, lifecycle-aware reload/smoke controls, and the 11-code audit
taxonomy; v0.25 rewrites Codex CLI exec; v0.24 adds AI provider presets, Kimi
`reasoning_content` compatibility, enriched input schemas, generated per-tool
docs under `Tools/UnrealMcpToolDocs/`, and progressive-disclosure agent docs;
v0.23 adds `cli-anything-ueatelier`; v0.22 adds `unreal.pie_smoke`; v0.21 adds
`unreal.editor_diagnostics`; v0.20 hardens async automation runs and watchdog
stale recovery; v0.19 completes the original Task Atlas Make Tool scaffold
path, To RAG ingestion, and label backfill; v0.19.1 disables Unity build for
the UnrealMcp module after a UE 5.6 collision. `unreal.configure_fps_settings`
remains scaffold-only pending functional verification.

Reform C v0.26 resolves the v0.25 self-extension incident by centralizing
server-message provider prompts in
`UnrealMcpAssistantSystemPromptBuilder`, baking in the six lifecycle/dry-run/
approval safety rules, enforcing the approval gate at the AssistantRun provider
seam, and making project-local Python user extensions the default path. v0.27
finishes the wall-off: AI self-extension is Python user tools only, while core
C++ apply/pipeline and promotion are hidden, manual, developer-only, and
deferred.

Visible tool counts can differ because hidden entries and aliases are filtered.
Trust `/tool unreal.mcp_workbench_status {}` and
`/tool unreal.mcp_tool_audit {}`. Validate registry changes with:

```bash
python3 Tools/validate_tool_registry.py
```

## C++ Architecture File Inventory

`UnrealMcpModule.cpp` is intentionally thin. Do not add tool logic there.

```text
Lifecycle/protocol: UnrealMcpModule.cpp, UnrealMcpProtocol.cpp,
  UnrealMcpProtocolBuilders.h

  Private/Tests/UnrealMcpTaskAtlasCompositeTests.cpp and
  Private/Tests/UnrealMcpCaptureRedactionTests.cpp and
  Private/Tests/UnrealMcpCapturedArgsStoreTests.cpp
```

Prefer cautious single-category edits. The largest files remain ChatPanel,
ActorTools, KnowledgeTools, ScaffoldTools, BlueprintTools, WidgetTools,
ToolDefinitions, AssistantRun, and several SelfExtension helpers.

## Tool-count Discipline

The registry tool count must stay synced across the canonical registry, plugin
mirror, the `"the registry contained N entries"` line in this AGENTS.md, the
`N registered MCP tools` line in `README.md` (EN + Chinese + Japanese), and
the tool lists in `Plugins/UnrealMcp/README.md`.

```bash
python3 -c 'import json; print(len(json.load(open("Tools/UnrealMcpToolRegistry/tools.json"))["tools"]))'
grep -nE "registry contained|registered MCP tools" AGENTS.md README.md Docs/agents-guide/*.md
```

Before any commit that adds or removes a tool, bump all tool-count references
in the same commit.

## Safety Rules For Future AI

Always: run `git status --short` before editing; respect existing uncommitted
changes; prefer `rg`/`rg --files`; use `apply_patch` for manual edits; keep
generated local data out of Git; use fixed schemas; ensure write tools have
policy, preflight, and postcheck metadata; dry run, backup, manifest, build,
test, and rollback source mutations; use `unreal.preview_change_plan` or
document the plan for high-risk tasks; write/read project memory for long work;
run `unreal.knowledge_eval_run` if RAG/tool recommendation changes; run
`python3 Tools/validate_tool_registry.py` if ToolRegistry changes; update
`AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, and focused docs after meaningful changes.

Avoid: putting new tools directly into `UnrealMcpModule.cpp`; committing
`Saved/`, generated KnowledgeIndex, local fetched docs, API keys, local
supervisor launchers, or unreviewed scaffolds; assuming `Content/` is clean
distributable plugin state; installing over both engine-level and project-level
plugin copies; assuming newly built C++ tools are visible until Editor restarts;
treating ChatHistory as canonical product docs.

### Coding discipline (Karpathy guidelines)

Full text + attribution now lives in the merged
`Tools/UnrealMcpSkills/mcp-self-extension/SKILL.md` playbook (MIT, from Andrej
Karpathy's observations on LLM coding pitfalls). These are the behavioral
counter to the v0.26 incident class (a 291-line embedded-Python handler =
"Simplicity First" violation; hand-merging into core = "Surgical Changes"
violation):

1. **Think Before Coding** — state assumptions; surface tradeoffs and multiple
   interpretations; push back when a simpler path exists; stop and ask when confused.
2. **Simplicity First** — minimum code that solves the problem; no speculative
   features/abstractions/flexibility; if 200 lines could be 50, rewrite.
3. **Surgical Changes** — touch only what the task requires; don't "improve"
   adjacent code/comments/formatting; mention unrelated dead code, don't delete it;
   only remove orphans your own change created. Every changed line traces to the request.
4. **Goal-Driven Execution** — turn tasks into verifiable success criteria
   (tests-first, dual-engine build + automation green) and loop until verified.

## Current Local Caveat

Re-check current state with `git status --short`, `git branch --show-current`,
and `python3 Tools/validate_tool_registry.py`. If the worktree is dirty,
inspect diffs before editing.
