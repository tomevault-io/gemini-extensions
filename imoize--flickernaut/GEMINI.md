# GNOME Shell Extension Part

## Import Best Practices
- Always use ES module imports with the new resource URI format (e.g., 'gi://GObject', 'resource:///org/gnome/shell/ui/main.js')
- Always place imports at the top level of the file, never inside functions or blocks
- Group imports by source (GNOME Shell core, GTK/GLib libraries, extension modules)
- For GTK 4, use 'gi://Gtk?version=4.0' format
- For Adw, use 'gi://Adw?version=1' format
- Never use the older imports.gi or imports.misc style imports
- Avoid legacy styles:
  - Do **not** use `imports.gi.*` or `imports.misc.*`
- Always place imports at the top level of the file, never inside functions or conditionals

## Extension Structure Best Practices
- All extensions must use class-based structure extending the Extension class
- All preference pages must use class-based structure extending ExtensionPreferences
- Use export default for the main extension and preferences classes
- Use this.getSettings() inside ExtensionPreferences instead of ExtensionUtils.getSettings()
- Use this.metadata and this.path instead of Me.metadata and Me.path

## Code Style Guidelines
- Use ES modules syntax (import/export) at the top level only
- Follow GNOME Shell 48 coding conventions and idioms
- Prefer async/await over callbacks where appropriate
- Use proper GObject class registration patterns
- Follow signals connection/disconnection best practices
- Handle proper cleanup in disable() methods

## Completion Behavior
- Always suggest imports at the file's top level only
- Flag improper import placement within functions or conditional blocks
- Prioritize completing whole logical blocks over single lines
- Suggest standardized import patterns for commonly used GNOME Shell modules
- Complete function signatures with proper parameter types and defaults
- Add descriptive JSDoc comments for public API methods
- Include type annotations for TypeScript-enabled environments

## Context Awareness
- Check for GObject inheritance patterns and suggest appropriate parent class methods
- Recognize GNOME Shell UI component patterns and suggest related components
- Detect signal connection patterns and suggest proper disconnection in cleanup
- Identify resource allocation and suggest proper cleanup patterns
- Recognize API version differences between GNOME 45, 46, 47, and 48

## Autocompletion Triggers
- When typing 'import' suggest common GNOME Shell module imports with proper resource URI format
- When typing 'class' suggest appropriate class extension patterns
- When typing extension lifecycle methods (enable/disable) suggest standard patterns
- When connecting signals, suggest corresponding disconnection code
- When creating UI elements, suggest standard style classes and properties

## Function Documentation
- Always provide documentation for public API methods
- Include parameter types and descriptions
- Document signal emissions
- Note any resource allocation that requires cleanup
- Indicate API compatibility concerns

## Extension Structure
- Suggest appropriate file organization for extensions
- Propose modular breakdown of complex extensions
- Recommend proper metadata.json structures
- Suggest appropriate GSettings schema organization
- Recommend proper prefs.js organization following the class-based pattern

## Error Handling
- Suggest try/catch blocks for file operations and external API calls
- Recommend proper error logging patterns using console.log
- Suggest defensive coding patterns for GNOME Shell API calls
- Recommend graceful fallbacks for version-specific features

## Performance Guidelines
- Flag potential performance issues in UI update loops
- Suggest debouncing for high-frequency events
- Recommend proper use of GLib timers with cancellation
- Identify potential memory leaks in signal connections
- Suggest batching UI updates where appropriate

## Development Workflow
- Suggest logging statements that aid debugging
- Recommend Looking Glass usage for interactive debugging
- Suggest extension testing patterns with nested sessions in Wayland
- Recommend proper extension packaging techniques
- Provide reload commands for extension testing

## Extension Compatibility
- Flag API usage that might be version-specific
- Suggest compatibility checks for different GNOME versions
- Recommend graceful fallbacks for version-specific features
- Suggest proper shell-version specifications in metadata.json

# GNOME Nautilus Extension Part

## Import Best Practices
- Use standard Python imports and PEP8-style grouping
- Always use `from gi.repository import` for GTK/Gio/Nautilus modules
- Do not use `gi.require_version` unless absolutely necessary (e.g., ambiguous GTK versions)
- Avoid `import *` and deprecated modules
- Prefer `Optional`, `list[str]`, and `dict[str, Any]` type annotations over `List`, `Dict` from typing

## Structure Best Practices
- All program models should be class-based
- Use separate modules (e.g., `models.py`, `manager.py`) for maintainability
- Use property decorators for calculated fields (e.g., `@property def is_installed`)
- Avoid global state outside of single registry or configuration loaders
- Structure code to align with GNOME directory layouts for schemas and resources

## Type Hints and Annotations
- Strongly prefer full Python type annotations (PEP 484/526 style)
- Annotate method return types and parameters, including constructors
- Use `tuple[str, ...]` for fixed-structure command arguments
- Avoid untyped `list`, `dict`, `any`, use `list[str]`, `dict[str, Any]`, etc.

## Code Style Guidelines
- Follow PEP8 with 4-space indentation
- Use snake_case for methods and variables, PascalCase for classes
- Place all imports at top level
- Use docstrings with triple quotes for all public classes and methods
- Prefer f-strings over old-style `%` formatting

## Completion Behavior
- Suggest complete method stubs with full type signatures and docstrings
- Insert missing docstrings or type annotations for existing methods
- Add property decorators where field access implies computation
- Suggest helper functions or static methods for repeated logic

## Docstring Style
- All public methods must have Google-style or reStructuredText docstrings
- Document parameter types and meanings
- Indicate return type and description
- For exceptions, include `Raises:` section
- Document GNOME-specific logic (e.g., `.desktop` lookup or Gio.Settings parsing)

## Extension Integration
- Suggest proper GSettings schema lookup patterns with `Gio.SettingsSchemaSource`
- When working with Nautilus.MenuItem, recommend id-prefix-safe naming
- Always disconnect signals, spawn cleanup when relevant
- Suggest `GLib.spawn_async` with `GLib.spawn_close_pid` for subprocess launching

## Error Handling
- Wrap file or settings parsing in try/except
- Raise descriptive RuntimeErrors for misconfigurations
- Use specific exception classes like `JSONDecodeError`, `KeyError`, `FileNotFoundError`

## Performance Guidelines
- Use `@lru_cache` for disk-bound or schema-heavy lookups
- Avoid repeated IO access in loops
- Reuse settings objects when possible

## Dev/Debug Recommendations
- Suggest `print` or `logging` for debugging only if logging is structured
- Avoid `print` in production extension logic
- Recommend dconf/gsettings CLI for settings validation

## Autocompletion Triggers
- When typing `class`, suggest base classes like `Nautilus.MenuProvider`, `object`
- When typing `@property`, suggest common property patterns
- When typing `def __init__`, suggest full signature with typing
- When typing `import`, recommend `gi.repository` modules and `os`, `json`, `typing`, `GLib`

## Compatibility Awareness
- Flag code that assumes GTK3/GTK4 availability without checks
- Suggest graceful fallback when a command or desktop file is missing
- Recommend version checks when relying on specific Nautilus behaviors

## Best Practices Summary
- Modular, type-safe, documented Python code
- Full integration with GNOME GSettings schema
- Nautilus.MenuItem creation follows naming conventions and behavior expectations
- Asynchronous or subprocess code uses `GLib.spawn_async` + `spawn_close_pid`
- Extension-specific data stays under `.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/<uuid>/`

## Example Definitions (for autocomplete suggestions)
- `ProgramRegistry`: Suggest extending `dict[int, Program]` with helper methods
- `Native` and `Flatpak`: Suggest property definitions and lazy loading patterns
- `Program`: Suggest `supports_files`, `installed_packages` as computed properties
- `ProgramConfigLoader`: Suggest GSettings access and `load_from_gsettings()` stubs
