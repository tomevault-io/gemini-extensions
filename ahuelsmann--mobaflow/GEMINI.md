# MOBAflow Project Context

- This repository is a `.NET 10` multi-project solution for model railroad automation.
- Use the current project names from the repository, not outdated doc aliases:
  - `MOBAflow` = WinUI desktop app
  - `MOBApi` = REST API / web backend
  - `MOBAsmart` = MAUI Android app
- Core cross-platform layers are `Domain`, `Common`, `Backend`,
  `SharedUI`, `Sound`, `TrackLibrary.Base`, `TrackLibrary.PikoA`, and
  `TrackPlan.Renderer`.
- Respect the dependency direction:
  - `Domain` -> `Backend/Common` -> `SharedUI` -> platform apps
- Use the SDK pinned in `global.json`:
  - `.NET SDK 10.0.103`
- Do not assume solution-level restore/build is the safest path for all environments.
  - Prefer targeted `dotnet restore <project>.csproj`
  - Prefer targeted `dotnet build <project>.csproj`
  - Standard test entry point is `dotnet test Test/Test.csproj`
- The user communicates in German.
- Code comments and XML documentation should be written in English.
- Keep changes small, reviewable, and easy to reason about.
- Do not perform Git write operations such as commit, push, merge,
  rebase, or cherry-pick.
- Suggest relevant tests when behavior changes.
