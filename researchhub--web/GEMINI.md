# Key Learnings from Senior Engineer Code Review

1. **Leverage React Providers for Global State**

   - Using context providers (like the ExchangeRateContext) is an effective way to share data application-wide.
   - Encapsulating fetch logic within these providers or in dedicated hooks can simplify the rest of the codebase and improve maintainability.

2. **Separate Concerns Between Services and View Layer**

   - Keep the "services" layer focused on fetching and basic data transformations.
   - Avoid placing view-specific formatting (e.g., icon lookup or UI-ready strings) inside services—this leads to entanglement and potential reusability issues.
   - Move highly UI-related transforms (for example, mapping distribution types to icons) into a dedicated "lib" or the "view layer" (e.g., inside component utilities or dedicated functions).

3. **Use Dedicated Transformers Carefully**

   - Keep data transformations minimal and "model-oriented" in services, returning clean, typed data.
   - Perform purely presentational transformations (e.g., formatting numeric values or currency strings) within the view layer to reduce the likelihood of unnecessary re-fetching or tight coupling.

4. **Consider Creating Custom Hooks for Data Fetching**

   - Custom hooks (like "useUserBalance") can abstract away internal fetch logic and state management, similar to how "useSession" works in Next.js.
   - This pattern improves readability, makes the code more composable, and centralizes asynchronous logic behind a well-defined interface.

5. **Watch Out for Unnecessary Re-Renders and Side Effects**

   - Multiple data retrieval triggers can cause performance issues or data inconsistencies if not handled carefully.
   - Use checks to ensure that data is only fetched when needed. Employ memoization or context effectively to prevent repetitive fetch calls.

6. **Embrace a Layered Architecture**

   - A "service" layer for API interactions.
   - A "types/model" layer to define and represent data structures.
   - A "view/presentation" layer (React components) that handles all UI and formatting.
   - This structure is analogous to classic architectural patterns (e.g., "MVC") and ensures a more scalable and maintainable application over time.

7. **Balance Raw Data vs. Derived Data**

   - Keep a reference to the raw data (unformatted, untransformed) for potential debugging and logic needs.
   - Derive only what's necessary for display in the UI to avoid confusion or data loss.

8. **Consistent, Incremental Refinement**

   - Small refactors—such as relocating formatting functions and hooking into contexts—can make a significant difference in clarity and scalability.
   - Regular feedback loops and code reviews help solidify best practices and ensure the application remains well-structured as it grows.

9. **Minimal Client-Side Caching and Centralized Data**

   - Use React Context for global or shared data rather than implementing multiple fetch calls or storing redundant data in each component.
   - Avoid heavy local caching or memoization beyond what React already provides; excessive caching can introduce staleness bugs and complicate the code.
   - Avoid React Query.
   - Fetch data once (for instance, in a provider) and rely on that single source of truth across your application.
   - Keep caching boundaries small: if data is needed by multiple components, lifting it into Context makes sense; otherwise, store it locally.
   - Be mindful of Next.js server/client boundaries; avoid turning everything into a client-side component, as it diminishes server-rendering advantages.

10. **Keep File and Folder Names Consistent**

    - Use a clear and consistent naming scheme for files and folders. For example, if you have a component for an item in a list, call it `TransactionListItem.tsx`, not `TransactionItem.tsx`.
    - For directories, use lowercase (e.g., `services`, `skeletons`) and consider capitalization for React component files.

11. **Use Descriptive Names That Reflect Purpose**

    - Choose intuitive front-end labels that reflect the actual functionality; avoid ambiguous terms.
    - If you have a button that exports data, label it "Export CSV" or "Export," rather than something vague like "export by year."

12. **DTO vs. "Plain" Types**

    - In service files, use type names like `SomethingApiResponse` or `SomethingDto` to indicate it's a direct mapping from an API payload.
    - For app-wide types (after you've transformed them), use straightforward names like `Transaction` or `Notification` that don't reference the API layer.

13. **Keep Function Names Action-Oriented**

    - Use verbs and descriptive phrases, like `markAllAsRead()` instead of `mark()`.
    - For fetching or transforming data, name them accordingly, e.g. `getTransactions()` or `transformTransaction()`.

14. **Use Short but Unambiguous Events or Handlers**

    - Handlers should be clear about which user action they handle, such as `onClickDeposit` or `handleDeposit`.
    - Keep them concise: `onClose`, `onClick`, `handleSubmit`, etc.

15. **Simplify Type Organization and API Integration**

    - Avoid using `.dto` files for API types unless specifically needed (e.g., authentication).
    - Maintain two primary files for each domain:
      1. A service file (e.g., `services/organization.service.ts`) handling API calls
      2. A types file (e.g., `types/organization.ts`) containing domain types and transformers
    - Use `any` type for raw API responses in service files since we don't control the API
    - Define clean, transformed types in the types directory that match our application's needs
    - Implement defensive transformers with null checks (e.g., `response.items || []`)
    - Keep service methods focused on API calls and basic error handling
    - Return transformed, application-specific types from service methods
    - Consider adding specific error classes for each service domain

16. **State Management Best Practices**

    - Be cautious with object dependencies in useEffect hooks
    - Remember that object reassignment (even with same values) triggers effects due to reference changes
    - Use additional state variables to prevent unnecessary re-fetching when dealing with session-like objects
    - Consider implementing fetch flags or other mechanisms to prevent duplicate API calls

17. **Type Naming Conventions**

    - Avoid prefixes like "Formatted" in type names
    - Use clear, domain-focused names (e.g., `Organization` instead of `FormattedOrganization`)
    - Keep type definitions close to their domain context
    - Use transformer functions to convert API data to application types

18. **Error Handling Philosophy**

    - Let errors bubble up naturally unless there's a specific need to handle them
    - Remove unnecessary try-catch blocks that just re-throw errors
    - Fail fast when data is invalid rather than trying to recover silently
    - Use try-catch only when:
      1. You can meaningfully recover from the error
      2. You need to transform the error type
      3. The API doesn't return data in the expected format
    - For API interactions:
      1. Always use try-catch to transform technical errors into domain-specific ones
      2. Ensure errors are followed by user-facing alerts (even if implementation is deferred)
      3. Keep error messages user-friendly but specific enough for debugging

19. **Debugging and Logging**

    - Avoid committing console.log statements to production code
    - Use proper error tracking and monitoring tools instead
    - If logging is needed, implement structured logging with proper levels
    - Consider adding debug flags for development-only logging

20. **Component Naming Best Practices**

    - Name components based on their primary function, not their location or styling
    - Use action-oriented names for interactive components (e.g., `OrganizationSwitcher` instead of `OrganizationHeader`)
    - Consider the component's role in the larger application context
    - Examples:
      - ✅ `OrganizationSwitcher` (describes action/purpose)
      - ❌ `OrganizationHeader` (describes location/styling)
      - ✅ `NoteList` (describes content type)
      - ❌ `SidebarContent` (too generic/location-based)

21. **Avoid Premature Library Adoption**

    - Carefully evaluate third-party libraries before adoption, even popular ones like React Query. 
    - Consider future architecture plans (e.g., potential GraphQL migration) when making library choices
    - Prefer built-in React patterns (contexts, custom hooks) for data fetching until complexity justifies additional abstractions
    - Development-mode double rendering (from React Strict Mode) is expected; validate actual issues in staging/production before optimizing


22. **URL as Source of Truth**

    - Use URL parameters as the primary source of truth for route-dependent state
    - Instead of managing parallel state that needs to stay in sync with the URL:
      ```typescript
      // ❌ Don't sync state manually
      const [currentOrg, setCurrentOrg] = useState(null);
      useEffect(() => {
        setCurrentOrg(findOrgBySlug(params.orgSlug));
      }, [params.orgSlug]);

      // ✅ Derive state from URL directly
      const params = useParams();
      const currentOrg = organizations.find(o => o.slug === params.orgSlug);
      ```
    - Let the URL drive state changes rather than managing duplicate state
    - Avoid storing URL-derived data in local state unless absolutely necessary

23. **Provider-Based State Management**

    - Design providers to be self-contained and autonomous:
      ```typescript
      // ❌ Don't expose state management methods
      const OrgContext = {
        selectedOrg,
        setSelectedOrg,
        syncWithUrl,  // Avoid external sync methods
      };

      // ✅ Handle state management internally
      const OrgContext = {
        selectedOrg,  // Only expose read-only state
        organizations,
        isLoading,
      };
      ```
    - Providers should manage their own state synchronization
    - Components should not need to know how provider state is managed
    - Minimize the API surface of providers to prevent misuse

24. **Component State Dependencies**

    - Be explicit about component state dependencies:
      ```typescript
      // ❌ Don't depend on multiple sources of truth
      if (isLoadingNotes || !note || orgSlug !== selectedOrg?.slug) {
        return <Loading />;
      }

      // ✅ Use derived state from a single source
      const isReady = selectedOrg?.slug === orgSlug && !isLoading && note;
      if (!isReady) return <Loading />;
      ```
    - Avoid components having to reconcile state from multiple sources
    - Let providers handle state reconciliation
    - Components should consume ready-to-use state

25. **Effect Dependencies in Providers**

    - Keep effect dependencies minimal and stable:
      ```typescript
      // ❌ Don't include unnecessary dependencies
      useEffect(() => {
        syncOrganization(selectedOrg, currentSlug);
      }, [selectedOrg, organizations, currentSlug]); // Too many deps

      // ✅ Use minimal, stable dependencies
      useEffect(() => {
        if (!organizations.length || !currentSlug) return;
        const org = organizations.find(o => o.slug === currentSlug);
        setSelectedOrg(org);
      }, [currentSlug, organizations]); // Only essential deps
      ```
    - Providers should have clear, focused effects
    - Each effect should have a single responsibility
    - Use early returns to prevent unnecessary state updates

26. **Navigation and State Updates**

    - Separate navigation from state management:
      ```typescript
      // ❌ Don't couple navigation with state updates
      const handleOrgSelect = async (org) => {
        setSelectedOrg(org);
        await router.push(`/org/${org.slug}`);
      };

      // ✅ Handle navigation only, let providers manage state
      const handleOrgSelect = (org) => {
        router.push(`/org/${org.slug}`);
      };
      ```
    - Let URL changes drive state updates through providers
    - Components should focus on navigation and UI interactions
    - Avoid mixing navigation logic with state management

    These patterns help prevent:
    - Duplicate API calls from multiple state syncs
    - Race conditions in state updates
    - Unnecessary component re-renders
    - Complex state management in components


27. **Smart Orchestration Layer**

    - Use a smart orchestration layer between services and view components:
      ```typescript
      // ❌ Don't fetch data directly in view components
      const NoteEditor = () => {
        const { note } = useNote(noteId);
        return <Editor content={note.content} />;
      };

      // ✅ Use a smart orchestrator to manage data flow
      const NotePage = () => {
        const { notes } = useOrganizationNotes();
        const initialNote = notes.find(n => n.id === noteId);
        const [shouldFetchContent, setShouldFetchContent] = useState(false);

        // Control when to fetch full content
        useEffect(() => {
          if (initialNote) setShouldFetchContent(true);
        }, [initialNote?.id]);

        return <Editor content={note.content} />;
      };
      ```
    - Orchestration layer responsibilities:
      1. Coordinate data dependencies
      2. Control fetch timing
      3. Handle loading states
      4. Transform data for view layer
    - Benefits:
      - Prevents duplicate API calls
      - Provides better loading UX
      - Keeps view components simple
      - Makes data flow explicit

28. **Progressive Data Loading**

    - Load data in stages based on what the user needs immediately:
      ```typescript
      // ❌ Don't fetch everything upfront
      const { fullNote } = useNote(noteId);

      // ✅ Load progressively
      const { metadata } = useNotesList();  // Quick list view
      const { content } = useNoteContent(shouldLoad ? id : null);  // Full content when needed
      ```
    - Implementation patterns:
      1. Start with minimal metadata
      2. Show immediate UI feedback
      3. Load full content when needed
      4. Update UI progressively
    - Key principles:
      - Show something to users as quickly as possible
      - Only fetch what's needed when it's needed
      - Use loading states to maintain UI responsiveness
      - Let the orchestration layer control the loading sequence

29. **Data Flow Control**

    - Manage data flow through clear boundaries:
      ```typescript
      // ❌ Don't mix concerns
      const Component = () => {
        const [data, setData] = useState(null);
        useEffect(() => {
          fetchData().then(setData);
        }, [id]);
      };

      // ✅ Separate concerns with clear boundaries
      // Service layer - Data fetching
      const useNoteService = (id) => {
        return NoteService.getNote(id);
      };

      // Orchestration layer - Flow control
      const NotePage = () => {
        const { initialNote } = useNotesList();
        const { fullNote } = useNoteContent(whenReady ? id : null);
      };

      // View layer - Display only
      const NoteEditor = ({ content, isLoading }) => {
        return <Editor content={content} />;
      };
      ```
    - Key principles:
      - Services handle raw data fetching
      - Orchestration controls data flow
      - Views handle presentation only
      - Each layer has a single responsibility

  30. **URL-Driven Navigation Patterns**

    - Handle navigation state changes in a predictable sequence:
      ```typescript
      // ❌ Don't mix navigation and data dependencies
      const handleSwitch = async (item) => {
        setSelected(item);
        if (data.length) {
          await router.push(`/${item.slug}/${data[0].id}`);
        } else {
          await router.push(`/${item.slug}`);
        }
      };

      // ✅ Use conditional navigation with clear fallbacks
      const handleSwitch = async (item) => {
        const targetPath = data.length > 0
          ? `/${item.slug}/${data[0].id}`
          : `/${item.slug}`;
        await router.push(targetPath);
      };
      ```
    - Key principles:
      - Let URL changes trigger state updates, not the other way around
      - Handle navigation edge cases (e.g., missing data) with clear fallbacks
      - Keep navigation logic separate from data fetching
      - Use the URL to drive the initial state of the application
