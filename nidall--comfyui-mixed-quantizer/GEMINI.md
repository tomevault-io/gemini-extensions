## Project

`comfyui_wxa8_quantizer.py` is a standalone, single-file converter that turns
generative-model checkpoints into ComfyUI-native quantized checkpoints. It
does not import ComfyUI or comfy-kitchen at runtime.

The mixed mode (`--format mixed`) is a per-layer optimizer over the
ComfyUI-native formats `convrot_w4a4`, `asym_w4a8_int8`, and
`int8_tensorwise`, merged into main from the `experimental/mixed-precision`
branch. `--format w4a8` remains the default and is byte-identical to main
v1.3.0 (golden vectors and the 39/39 self-test suite prove it).

- Local path: `/home/nidall/projects/testdeepseek/quantizationscripts_w4a8_w3a8`
- Repo (public): `https://github.com/NidAll/comfyui-mixed-quantizer`
- Branch: `main` (the experimental branch was merged)
- Script version: `1.4.0-experimental` (`CONVERTER_VERSION`)
- Audit status: P0 items closed (hard quality/compression gates, BF16
  promotion candidate, runtime-output calibration metric, per-format runtime
  compatibility probe) and the follow-up implementation plan applied
  (W4A8 runtime-basis simulation, target-accurate W4A4, simulator
  equivalence suite, targeted global metric, unified ORIGINAL candidate,
  per-format capability matrix, certification levels, model-level quality
  harness, strict mixed smoke mode, upstream runtime-contract nightly sync).
  Krea2 policy fixed for the real Kroma v0.2 naming (blocks.N / txtfusion
  layerwise+refiner, commit e0141d7; krea2-real-dims self-test pins it).
  Remaining certification gaps are documented in the README limitations
  (real-model three-layout forward, LoRA/offload/low-VRAM, e2e generation,
  balanced-v1 threshold tuning from the benchmark matrix).

## Format facts (verified, do not guess)

### W4A8 (unchanged from main)

Per quantized layer: `{layer}.weight` int8 [N, K/2] (even column low nibble),
`{layer}.weight_s_rel` fp8_e4m3fn [N, K/16], `{layer}.weight_s_channel` fp32
[N], `{layer}.weight_codebook` fp32 [16]. Metadata: `format=asym_w4a8_int8`,
`group_size=16`, `convrot=true`, `convrot_groupsize=256`. K % 256 == 0 is
required (CUDA fused kernels are ConvRot-256-only).

### W4A4 (new, convrot_w4a4)

- `{layer}.weight` int8 [N, K/2], packed signed int4, low nibble = even column
  (matches comfy-kitchen `_pack_int4_row_major`)
- `{layer}.weight_scale` fp32 [N], rowwise absmax / 7, emission range [-7, 7]
  (matches eager `quantize_convrot_w4a4_weight`; golden-vector byte digests in
  `_test_w4a4_golden`)
- Metadata: `format=convrot_w4a4`, `convrot_groupsize` (largest power of 4 in
  {16, 64, 256} dividing K), `quant_group_size=64` (kernel contract), and
  `linear_dtype` (execution variant only: int4 or int8, default int8; never a
  quality fallback)
- Eligibility: K % 64 == 0 and K % cgs == 0. Boogu 3360 and OmniGen2 2520 are
  NOT eligible (3360 % 64 = 32, 2520 % 64 = 24). PixArt 1152, HunyuanDiT 1408,
  CogVideoX-2B 1920, SDXL 320/640, MiniMax fc2 1152 ARE eligible.
- Measured weight error ~0.142, about 2x the W4A8 codebook path (0.070).
  Dequant requires the signed nibble interpretation (`unpack_int4_signed`,
  NOT `unpack_w4` which is unsigned).

### INT8 (new, int8_tensorwise)

- `{layer}.weight` int8 [N, K], `{layer}.weight_scale` fp32 [N, 1]
  (rowwise absmax / 127, clamp min 1e-30; [N, 1] so eager and CUDA backends
  both broadcast; matches eager `quantize_int8_rowwise`, golden digests in
  `_test_int8_golden`)
- Metadata: `{"format": "int8_tensorwise"}` only. No ConvRot, no K constraint.
  This is the universal fallback tier and the fix for Boogu/OmniGen2.
- Measured weight error ~0.005. Comfy-Org ships the same rowwise scheme in
  its `*_int8_convrot` checkpoints (those add convrot=true; we do not).

## Mixed mode design

`MixedPlanner` (in the converter): per-layer candidate evaluation (quantize +
dequantize each eligible format; with calibration activations the error is
the RUNTIME OUTPUT error, an exact eager-path emulation: activation rotation,
dynamic rowwise activation quantization (int8, or int4 for the W4A4 int4
variant), and the scaled quantized GEMM), cheapest-acceptable selection under
the profile's per-layer gate, then a greedy promotion loop (best error
reduction per extra byte, original precision included as the final rescue)
until the PARAM-WEIGHTED global mean gate passes. Selection and promotion
mutate `TensorDecision.format` / `.convrot_groupsize` and must run BEFORE
`build_output_entries` (output shapes and offsets depend on per-layer
formats).

`--target-runtime` feeds `RuntimeCapabilities` (`runtime_capabilities_for`)
into eligibility: nvidia = all three formats accelerated (verified on the RTX
3050), amd = HIP/triton paths (not certified here), cpu = eager fallback for
all three. Capabilities are per-format `FormatRuntimeCapability`
(loadable/executable/accelerated/backend/reason), never a single boolean.
The W4A4 simulation is dispatch-aware via
`resolve_w4a4_execution_mode` (mirrors the comfy-kitchen CUDA dispatcher:
int8 -> A8 always; int4 -> native INT4 MMA on SM8x, uncertain on Turing
SM 7.5, INT8 fallback elsewhere; eager always A4). `W4A4ExecutionMode`
carries activation_bits/path/certain/reason. Uncertain modes evaluate BOTH
A4 and A8 and score with the WORST error (never optimistic). A runtime
certificate (`tools/runtime_certify.py`, `--runtime-certificate`) overrides
the static model with observed behavior; `--require-runtime-certificate`
hard-fails when any selected format is not certified. CandidateResult
records requested_linear_dtype + effective_activation_bits +
effective_runtime_path + runtime_certified + runtime_certain + backend.
`RuntimeCapabilities` carries gpu_name/cuda_capability/rocm_arch/torch
versions/runtime_certified and is built with env data
(`runtime_capabilities_for(backend, env)`). `FormatRuntimeCapability` uses
`accelerated: Optional[bool]` + `certified`; describe() distinguishes
runtime-certified accelerated/fallback, expected accelerated (not
certified), eager/fallback, and acceleration-unknown. AMD acceleration is
gated by `rocm_matrix_core_supported` (gfx11/gfx12 + CDNA gfx9). Unsupported
formats get `eligible=False` with the reason recorded. Before conversion
`_check_runtime_compatibility` fails closed: every selected format must exist
in the installed ComfyUI quant_ops registry (when comfy is installed) and
every required layout must exist in comfy-kitchen (when installed); neither
installed -> warning only.

Simulators are validated against the real runtime, not by hand:
`testdata/runtime_equivalence.py` requires exact output agreement (bound
1e-4; measured 0 to 5e-8) between our W4A4-A4 / W4A8 / INT8 simulations and
comfy-kitchen's eager kernels across the awkward K matrix, on every CI push.
The W4A8 simulation operates in the ConvRot basis
(`decode_w4a8_runtime_weight` -> rotated int8 runtime weight); NEVER multiply
rotated activations by the inverse-rotated physical weight. The W4A4 A8 mode
is CUDA-only; cuda_smoke compares its error-vs-BF16 with the CUDA kernel
(measured gap 0.7%, bound 10%). CUDA kernels are numerically different
implementations of the same quantization (fused int4 packing differs from
eager in the last digits); exact equivalence is defined against eager.

Global metric semantics: `targeted_weighted_error` covers the ENTIRE targeted
set (original-precision layers contribute error 0 but keep their parameters
in the denominator); `quantized_weighted_error` is the diagnostic subset
metric. The gate uses the targeted metric. ORIGINAL precision is a unified
candidate (`CandidateResult` with zero error and source bytes), so select and
promote need no special case beyond kind switching.

Certification levels: converter stamps `quality_validation.level` =
"unverified" (no calibration) or "calibrated" (runtime-output calibration) in
the v2 metadata; `testdata/model_quality.py` stamps "model-verified" on the
target machine. Never claim model-verified without running it.

Profiles (`MIXED_PROFILE_DEFAULTS`):

| Profile | layer gate | global gate | B/param target | max original share |
| ------- | ---------: | ----------: | -------------: | -----------------: |
| balanced | 0.10 | 0.08 | 0.90 | 0.05 |
| conservative | 0.05 | 0.04 | 1.05 | 0.02 |
| size-first | 0.15 | 0.10 | 0.75 | 0.10 |

Gate defaults are anchored to the measured W4A8 weight error (~0.073). Do not
"improve" them without re-measuring on real dims. `--quality-gate`,
`--global-error-gate`, `--max-linear-bytes-per-param`, and
`--max-bf16-fraction` override; without calibration the quality gates use
weight-only error and the planner warns.

Gates are HARD (audit P0 fixes): `_enforce_gates` raises QualityGateError
(weighted mean error above the global gate, or a plan that quantizes nothing)
and CompressionGateError (effective targeted bpp above target, or
original-precision share above the limit). The global mean is PARAM-WEIGHTED
by layer params, not a plain average. BF16/FP16 is a real promotion candidate
(original bytes, zero error): a layer can be promoted INT8 -> original, and
an all-original plan is rejected, never published.

## Environment

Same as main: uv venv, no model checkpoints stored locally. GPU is an RTX
3050; `--device cuda` works for quantization and CUDA smoke tests run for
real here. `research/ComfyUI` is v0.30.0 + loader patch (gitignored, do not
reset). `.venv` has torch 2.13.0+cu130 and comfy-kitchen 0.2.28.

Tools: `tools/hf_mixed_quantize.py` (original Colab flow) and
`tools/hf_mixed_quantize_optimized.py` (same flow, faster: hf_transfer
download, `--validate` opt-in instead of always-on, disk preflight, phase
timing). The optimized variant is the one to recommend for real conversions;
the original stays for reference.

Install: `uv pip install --python .venv/bin/python -r requirements.txt`
(core converter plus huggingface_hub for the Colab download/upload flow);
`-r requirements-optional.txt` adds comfy-kitchen + packaging for the
companion tools that may import it (runtime_certify, runtime_equivalence,
certified_convert --certify). The standalone converter never needs the
optional set.

Expected results on the fixtures: boogu_real mixed = 19 W4A8 + 134 INT8
layers, 346.69 MiB vs 1.19 GiB input, 328/328 validation checks pass; wan
mixed balanced = 16 W4A8 + 4 INT8; wan mixed size-first = 10 W4A8 + 9 W4A4 +
1 INT8 (9.75 MiB).

## Verification before claiming success

1. `--self-test` must pass 39/39 (includes W4A4/INT8 golden vectors with an
   EMBEDDED reference weight: packed nibble agreement >= 0.995 + fp32 scales
   rtol 1e-4, because the Hadamard-rotation matmul and torch.randn differ in
   the last ULPs across platforms; never use byte-exact sha assertions on
   randn-generated inputs in new tests), eligibility matrix, mixed planning
   on real Boogu dims AND real Kroma v0.2 (krea2) dims
   (krea2-real-dims: blocks.N.attn.wq/wk/wv/wo/gate, blocks.N.mlp.gate/up/
   down, txtfusion layerwise+refiner blocks must quantize; first/last/tmlp/
   txtmlp/tproj/txtfusion.projector must not), mixed e2e with comfy-kitchen
   layout reload, hard gate failures, BF16 promotion, runtime capability
   matrix incl. eager-A4 vs CUDA-A8, runtime-output metric vs eager kernels,
   planner determinism (mixed-determinism), corrupted heterogeneous metadata
   rejection (mixed-metadata-fuzz: W4A4 bad cgs / K%64 / missing scale /
   format-tensor mismatch, INT8 wrong scale dims), architecture sync.
2. All fixture families must pass `--validate` in BOTH `--format w4a8`
   (regression; max relL2 about 0.073) and `--format mixed --profile balanced`
   (0 failed).
3. `testdata/cuda_smoke.py` must pass 10/10 on a CUDA machine (includes the
   W4A4 A8-mode simulator-vs-kernel quality check).
4. CI workflows are temporarily removed (they live in git history:
   ci.yml, cuda-smoke.yml, nightly-sync.yml, release-compat.yml). Run the
   self-tests, fixture conversions (w4a8 + mixed, including a
   `--validation-only` re-check) and the sync scripts locally until they
   are restored.
5. For loader questions, reproduce with the real ComfyUI path:
   `PYTHONPATH=research/ComfyUI .venv/bin/python`, flow
   `load_torch_file -> convert_old_quants -> load_diffusion_model_state_dict`,
   then check weights are `QuantizedTensor` with the expected layout classes
   (`TensorCoreConvRotW4A4Layout`, `AsymW4A8Int8Layout`, `TensorWiseINT8Layout`).
   `testdata/comfyui_smoke.py` now asserts the layout of every quantized layer
   against its metadata format for both w4a8 and mixed checkpoints, and
   `--require-format` forces a checkpoint to actually contain the listed
   formats before the forward runs.
6. `testdata/comfyui_architecture_sync.py` must pass against the pinned
   ComfyUI revision (CI tarball mode) and against the local
   `research/ComfyUI` checkout when present. The (currently removed)
   nightly workflow checked ComfyUI main + comfy-kitchen main with
   --check-runtime-contract (three QUANT_ALGOS names + scale names + three
   layout classes) and failed naming any regression; run the check locally
   until it is restored.
7. `testdata/runtime_equivalence.py` must pass (install comfy-kitchen and
   packaging first): our W4A4-A4 / W4A8 / INT8 simulators must agree with
   the real eager kernels to 1e-4 relative on the awkward K matrix.
8. Docs sync: every user-visible change (new family, format, option, profile,
   self-test count, CLI behavior, bug fix) must be reflected in README.md in
   the same commit; if a change needs no README update, the commit message
   says so. AGENTS.md facts (self-test count, commands, known behavior) must
   match the code and the README. Before claiming completion, diff the docs
   against the change and fix anything stale.

## Known behavior, do not "fix" it

- `unpack_w4` is the unsigned W4A8 codec; W4A4 dequant uses
  `unpack_int4_signed` (signed nibbles [-8, 7]). They are different on purpose.
- INT8 `weight_scale` is [N, 1], not [N]. [N] breaks the eager backend
  (`q.float() * scale` fails to broadcast) and the [N, 1] form works on eager
  and CUDA. The runtime-contract validator accepts both shapes for
  backwards-compatible reading.
- The w4a8-only mode must stay byte-identical to main. Any refactor of shared
  code (quantize dispatch, output entries, engine writers, metadata builders,
  plan_from_output, Validator) must keep `--format w4a8` outputs unchanged;
  the golden-vector and deterministic-conversion self-tests guard this.
- Extension metadata is schema-versioned: w4a8 outputs use `comfy_wxa8/v1`
  (W4A8-global fields), mixed outputs use `comfy_wxa8/v2` (`mode: mixed`,
  per-format contracts, distribution, gates, runtime status, w4a4_runtime
  block with requested/effective/certified semantics). Never write
  W4A8-global fields (fp8 scales, codebook packing) into a v2 block, and
  never put custom fields into official ComfyUI metadata.
- Original-precision fractions: `original_precision_parameter_fraction` and
  `original_precision_output_byte_fraction` are distinct and both reported;
  the hard gate `max_bf16_fraction` limits the OUTPUT BYTE fraction. The CLI
  alias `--max-original-byte-fraction` is preferred over the legacy
  `--max-bf16-fraction` name.
- `decode_w4a8_runtime_weight()` is LOCKED: DO NOT consolidate it with
  `dequantize_w4a8_weight()`. One returns the runtime-basis INT8 weight, the
  other the physical FP weight.
- `W4A4_LINEAR_DTYPE` is gone; the constant is `DEFAULT_W4A4_LINEAR_DTYPE`
  and the actual value lives on `TensorDecision.linear_dtype` (set when a
  W4A4 candidate is selected/promoted). Official metadata writes
  `d.linear_dtype or DEFAULT_W4A4_LINEAR_DTYPE`; extension metadata reads it
  from `mixed_plan["w4a4_linear_dtype"]`. NEVER mutate module globals from
  main (the old `globals()["W4A4_LINEAR_DTYPE"]` hack is removed).
- The global quality metric is the PARAM-WEIGHTED mean over the whole
  targeted set (`targeted_weighted_error`; original-precision layers count
  with error 0). `global_mean_error(info, decisions)` needs `info` now;
  callers must pass it. Promotion logs measure AFTER applying.
- The calibration metric simulates the runtime operation
  (`runtime_output_rel_l2` / `_simulate_quantized_chunk`): activation
  rotation, activation quantization, scaled GEMM. It is NOT
  `(dequant(W)-W)X`. The self-test cross-checks the W4A4-int4 simulation
  against comfy-kitchen's eager `convrot_w4a4_linear` (must agree within
  0.02).
- ConvRot for W4A8 is 256-only. W4A4 may use cgs 16/64/256 per layer.
- Only 2D linear weights are quantized. Convolutions, embeddings, norms,
  heads, and modulations pass through with the reason recorded.
- Fixtures are gitignored (`testdata/*.safetensors`); reports and the
  `boogu_real_fixture_mixed` golden output artifacts follow the repo rules:
  keep the tree clean of large artifacts, commit reports under
  `testdata/reports/`.
- Pickle inputs require `--trust-pickle`. Outputs never overwrite inputs.

## Editing and docs conventions

- One converter file. Edit with exact-string edits and recompile.
- README.md is the user-facing document and the only project markdown file
  besides this one. Keep it aligned with the code AT ALL TIMES:
  * Every feature, format, family, option, profile, test-count change, or
    user-visible bug fix updates README.md in the same commit.
  * A commit that changes user-visible behavior without a README update must
    state why in the commit message.
  * Before claiming a task complete, re-read the README sections that the
    change touches (quick start, options, formats, profiles, architecture
    table, validation, limitations) and fix anything stale: self-test counts,
    option lists, example outputs, numbers, and tables.
  * New families or formats are added to the README architecture table and
    format sections; new self-tests update the self-test count and the
    validation list.
- README.md is humanizer-clean: no em dashes, no AI vocabulary, no
  rule-of-three padding, plain technical prose.
- AGENTS.md is agent-facing and follows the same plain-prose rules; its facts
  (self-test count, commands, known behavior, format facts) must match the
  code and the README.
- Commit messages summarize behavior and evidence. This branch is
  experimental; do not push to main.
- The ComfyUI W4A4/INT8 loader contracts were verified against the installed
  comfy-kitchen 0.2.28 (eager implementations) and ComfyUI v0.30.0+patch
  (`comfy/ops.py` layer_conf parsing: convrot_w4a4 reads convrot_groupsize,
  hard-codes quant_group_size 64, reads linear_dtype; int8_tensorwise reads
  weight_scale plus optional convrot fields).

## User context

The user runs ComfyUI on Windows at `C:\Comfyui\ComfyUI` (v0.30.0 plus 23
commits) with the loader patch. ComfyUI >= v0.31.0 loads all three formats
natively. The real Boogu-Image-0.1-Turbo (hidden 3360, FFN 13568) is the
primary target: mixed balanced turns the 364 previously-BF16 layers into
INT8, bringing the output from ~16 GB to ~9.6 GB while keeping the 54
K=13568 layers at W4A8.

The user also converts Kroma v0.2 Turbo (Krea2 fine-tune, lodestones/Kroma,
kroma-v0.2-turbo.safetensors, 25.64 GB BF16). The krea2 family policy must
match its real naming (blocks.N.attn.wq/wk/wv/wo/gate, blocks.N.mlp.gate/
up/down, txtfusion.layerwise_blocks / refiner_blocks), which the
krea2-real-dims self-test pins. Expected w4a8 result: 256 of 430 tensors
quantized, ~7.7 GB output.
