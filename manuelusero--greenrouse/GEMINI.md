# Project Manager Rules for AI Development Agent

## Core Development Principles

### Code Quality Standards

- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Never duplicate code. Extract reusable components, functions, and utilities
- **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**: Write simple, readable code. Avoid over-engineering
- **SOLID Principles**: Follow single responsibility, open/closed, Liskov substitution, interface segregation, and dependency inversion
- **Clean Code**: Write self-documenting code with meaningful names, small functions, and clear structure

### Architecture & Scalability

- **Scalable Design**: Build modular, maintainable architecture that can grow with the project
- **Separation of Concerns**: Keep business logic, data access, and presentation layers separate
- **Design Patterns**: Apply appropriate design patterns for common problems
- **Performance**: Write efficient code with proper optimization and caching strategies

## Development Workflow

### Code Generation Rules

- **Minimal Code**: Generate only what's necessary. Avoid boilerplate and redundant code
- **Refactoring First**: Always refactor existing code before adding new features
- **Incremental Development**: Build features incrementally with small, testable changes
- **Code Reviews**: Treat every code generation as if it will be peer-reviewed

### Testing Requirements

- **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests before or alongside implementation code
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Include unit tests, integration tests, and E2E tests where appropriate
- **Test Quality**: Write meaningful tests that cover edge cases and error scenarios
- **Regression Testing**: Ensure new changes don't break existing functionality

## Code Management

### Refactoring Guidelines

- **Continuous Refactoring**: Refactor code as soon as technical debt is identified
- **Code Smells**: Eliminate code smells immediately (long methods, large classes, duplicate code)
- **Performance Optimization**: Profile and optimize bottlenecks without premature optimization
- **Legacy Code**: Improve legacy code incrementally with proper test coverage

### Best Practices

- **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling and logging throughout the application
- **Security**: Follow security best practices (input validation, authentication, authorization)
- **Documentation**: Write clear, concise documentation for complex logic and APIs
- **Version Control**: Use meaningful commit messages and proper branching strategies

## Technology-Specific Rules

### React/Next.js

- Use functional components with hooks
- Implement proper state management (useState, useContext, Redux/Zustand when needed)
- Optimize performance with React.memo, useMemo, useCallback
- Follow accessibility guidelines (WCAG)

### TypeScript

- Use strict TypeScript configuration
- Define proper interfaces and types
- Avoid 'any' type - use unknown or proper typing
- Use generics for reusable components

### Database/API

- Use proper data validation and sanitization
- Implement efficient database queries
- Use appropriate HTTP methods and status codes
- Handle API errors gracefully

## Quality Assurance

### Before Submitting Code

- [ ] Code follows all architectural patterns
- [ ] Tests are written and passing
- [ ] No console.log statements in production code
- [ ] Error handling is implemented
- [ ] Code is properly formatted and linted
- [ ] Documentation is updated if needed
- [ ] Performance implications are considered
- [ ] Security vulnerabilities are checked

### Code Review Checklist

- [ ] Code is readable and maintainable
- [ ] No duplicate code exists
- [ ] Tests cover critical paths
- [ ] Error handling is comprehensive
- [ ] Performance is optimized
- [ ] Security best practices are followed

## Communication & Collaboration

### Reporting Standards

- Provide clear progress updates with specific technical details
- Highlight blockers and risks immediately
- Suggest improvements and optimizations
- Document architectural decisions and trade-offs

### Problem-Solving Approach

1. **Analyze**: Understand the problem domain and requirements
2. **Plan**: Design solution considering scalability and maintainability
3. **Implement**: Write clean, tested code following best practices
4. **Review**: Refactor and optimize the implementation
5. **Document**: Update documentation and communicate changes

## Continuous Improvement

### Learning & Adaptation

- Stay updated with latest best practices and technologies
- Learn from code reviews and feedback
- Improve development processes continuously
- Share knowledge and mentor others

### Metrics & Monitoring

- Track code quality metrics (coverage, complexity, duplication)
- Monitor performance and identify optimization opportunities
- Measure development velocity and bottlenecks
- Use data-driven decisions for improvements
