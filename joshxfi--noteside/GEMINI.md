# AGENTS.md

Guidance for any coding agent working in this repository — the single, tool-agnostic source of truth for how Noteside is built. Keep it accurate as the architecture changes.

## What this is

Noteside — an offline & **keyboard-first** notes desktop app (full vim _and_ conventional shortcuts, both first-class), plus its marketing site. Turborepo + pnpm monorepo:

- `apps/desktop` — Tauri 2 + React 19 + Vite + TypeScript (the app)
- `apps/landing` — Vite + React 19 + TypeScript + Tailwind v4 (the site)
- `apps/docs` — Fumadocs on React Router 7 (SPA, prerendered) — the documentation site at **docs.noteside.app** (`:3002` via `pnpm dev:docs`)
- `apps/brand` — Vite + React + Tailwind, the standalone **brand guide** (internal reference only; not deployed, not linked from the landing). Runs on `:3001` via `pnpm dev:brand`; has its own `logo.tsx` copy + `styles.css` (the brand CSS).

## Commands

Run from the repo root (Turborepo fans out to the right package):

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev              # everything: landing (:3000) + desktop Tauri window
pnpm dev:landing      # landing only
pnpm dev:desktop      # desktop only — runs `tauri dev` (needs Rust + Tauri system deps)
pnpm typecheck        # tsc --noEmit across the workspace  ← primary verification gate
pnpm build            # web bundles for all apps (Vite; docs via react-router)
pnpm lint             # oxlint (root; config .oxlintrc.json)   — pnpm lint:fix to autofix
pnpm format           # oxfmt (writes in place; root; config .oxfmtrc.json) — pnpm format:check to verify
```

Desktop / Tauri specifics:

```bash
pnpm --filter @noteside/desktop dev:web     # Vite only, no native window (browser dev)
pnpm --filter @noteside/desktop build       # web bundle → apps/desktop/dist
pnpm tauri build                            # full native bundle (see Icons below)
cd apps/desktop/src-tauri && cargo check    # verify the Rust shell compiles
# icon source of truth = scripts/mark.html (brand mark in Newsreader, exact design CSS).
# Render it with headless Chrome (see the file header) → src-tauri/app-icon.png, then:
pnpm --filter @noteside/desktop tauri icon src-tauri/app-icon.png  # → all bundle icons (.icns/.ico/png)
pnpm demo:build                             # build desktop web bundle → apps/landing/public/demo
pnpm --filter @noteside/desktop bench       # vitest benchmarks — JS hot paths (computeBacklinks, parse)
cd apps/desktop/src-tauri && cargo bench    # criterion — search/scan at 1k/10k/50k (benches/perf.rs)
```

**Performance posture (measured — see `benches/perf.rs` + `src/perf.bench.ts`).** `fuzzy_files` is sub-ms even at 50k (nucleo — untouched). `content_search` is a fast in-memory scan — even a rare/no-match query (the worst case) is ~2ms @1k, ~20ms @10k, ~100ms @50k, far past realistic note counts; no DB or index to build or sync. `scan_notebook` is a one-time 156ms @10k. The **sidebar virtualizes** above 100 notes (`@tanstack/react-virtual`; the plain list renders verbatim below). **Backlinks** run as a Rust command (`commands::backlinks` → `links.rs`, mirrors `src/links.ts`) so the scan stays off the JS thread and only references cross IPC.

Lint/format are oxc, run from the repo root (not per-package, not through Turbo): `oxlint` (`.oxlintrc.json`, correctness=error/suspicious=warn, react+typescript+import plugins) and `oxfmt` (`.oxfmtrc.json`; pinned exactly — still beta). The codebase is kept oxfmt-formatted, **including `styles.css`** (so it's no longer byte-identical to the design source — diff semantically, not line-for-line). Tests: **Vitest** (`pnpm test`, node env — pure modules only, no jsdom/CM6) covers `autosave.ts` (incl. the cross-note regression), `settings.ts` round-trip, and the mock backend; **cargo test** (`pnpm test:rust`) covers `notebook`/`search` (`#[cfg(test)]` modules). No e2e yet (deferred). `pnpm typecheck` + `pnpm lint` + both test suites are the gates.

## Architecture: the parts that span files

**The editor is CodeMirror 6 + `@replit/codemirror-vim`** (`apps/desktop/src/editor/`), not a bespoke engine — the old `src/vim.ts` reducer is gone. Ex-commands, the `<Space>` leader palette, `gf`, and `:`-actions dispatch through a module-level handler registry: `ex-commands.ts` (`Vim.defineEx`/`Vim.map` + `setActiveHandlers`) → `app.tsx`. To follow any save/quit/open/follow flow, read `editor/editor.tsx` (mount + handler wiring) + `editor/ex-commands.ts` (where actions/ex-commands originate) + `app.tsx` (the handlers) together. `live-preview.ts`/`wikilinks.ts` add reveal-on-cursor-line decorations; `theme.ts` maps the CSS-var design tokens into the editor.

**`editor/commands.ts` is the single command table.** Every command (id, title, chord, ex-names, leader key, `editor`-action) lives here; the vim ex-commands, the `<Space>` which-key palette, the always-on `Mod-` chord keymap, the searchable command palette (`CommandSearch`), the `Mod-/` cheatsheet, and button tooltips all DERIVE from it — add or rebind a command in one place. `use-global-chords.ts` is the document-level chord fallback for the no-note-open state (gated on overlay React state, not `activeElement`). In-note find is `@codemirror/search`, toggled via `Mod-f`. Non-vim users are first-class; `bind <chord> <command-id>` lines in `~/.notesiderc` remap chords. The `Mod-/` cheatsheet (`components/cheatsheet.tsx`) is itself the **in-app keymap editor** — focus a row, `Enter` records a chord, `Del` unbinds, `r` resets, with clash detection via `chordConflict` (commands.ts); edits write `cfg.chords` (→ `bind` lines). The always-on chord keymap lives in a CM6 `Compartment` (`editor.tsx`) that App reconfigures on a `cfg.chords` change, so a rebind applies to the open editor with no remount (a remount would steal focus from the open cheatsheet).

**Do NOT wrap the desktop app in `<React.StrictMode>`.** `apps/desktop/src/main.tsx` deliberately omits it. StrictMode's dev double-invoke of effects would double-run the editor's mount effect (creating two `EditorView`s and firing the action-flush twice → double saves/quits/finder-opens). The landing app _does_ use StrictMode (no such pattern).

**The per-buffer state machine lives in `editing-session.ts`** — a framework-free `createEditingSession` store (working/saved/dirty, autosave, open/save/quit, config-as-a-buffer-kind, external reconcile, the editor remount `key`), consumed via `use-editing-session.ts` (`useSyncExternalStore`). It imports no React, so the whole loop is node-testable (`editing-session.test.ts`). `app.tsx` drives the session and owns the sidebar list, config _semantics_ (`onConfigApply`), and panels — it **no longer holds the working/saved maps**. The Editor is remounted via its `key` (`session.editorKey` + a vim/preview suffix) so cursor position resets cleanly.

**The `~/.notesiderc` config buffer is a synthetic note.** `activeId === "config"` swaps the editor onto `configText` instead of a real note; `:w` runs `parseConfig` (settings.ts) and applies it. `settings.ts` round-trips `Config ⇄ text` via `serializeConfig`/`parseConfig`; the in-app `SettingsPanel` and the config buffer are two editors over the same `Config`. Config changes are applied by writing CSS custom properties (`--accent-base`, `--editor-font`, `--editor-size`, `--ui-scale`, etc.) onto `document.documentElement` in an effect in `app.tsx`. Beyond the obvious fields, `Config` carries `uiScale` (a 90–130% **UI-chrome** scale — `--ui-scale` multiplies the chrome `font-size`s via `calc()`; the editor is immune since it sizes from `--editor-size`) and `relativeNumbers` (gutter, default **off** = absolute); the editor remounts via its `key` on a `relativeNumbers`/vim/preview change. `font-size` floors at 16.

**Search lives behind the `backend/` seam.** The `Backend` interface (`src/backend/types.ts`) exposes `searchFiles(query) → FileHit[]` and `searchContent(query, mode) → ContentHit[]`. The Tauri adapter (`backend/tauri.ts`) `invoke()`s the Rust commands `search_files`/`search_content` (`src-tauri/src/search.rs`: nucleo `fuzzy_files` for path + title matching (separate `positions`/`titlePositions` highlight ranges), a `content_search` scan for plain/regex/fuzzy), and the in-memory `mock.ts` backs browser dev + the landing demo. `Finder` only talks to the `Backend` interface, so it's identical in both modes — and search stays fully in-memory (no database).

**`links.ts` is the wikilink seam — pure, CodeMirror-free.** `parseWikilinks` / `resolveLink` (title → exact filename → filename-slug → title-slug, ordered so ties are deterministic and empty/punctuation targets never match) / `wikilinkAt` (link under a cursor, half-open end) / `computeBacklinks`. The editor side (`editor/wikilinks.ts`) styles `[[links]]` and hides the `[[ ]]` syntax in live-preview using the _same_ reveal-on-cursor-line model as `live-preview.ts` (and exports `activeLines` from there), plus `[[`-autocomplete over note titles. `gf` / `:follow` (exCommands → `App.onFollowLink`) opens the resolved note; the backlinks panel (`<Space>l` / `:backlinks`) is `backend.readAllNotes()` + `computeBacklinks`. Wikilinks are **not** lezer-markdown nodes — they're regex-scanned and never rewritten, so vim motions stay on the literal `[[Target]]` text. To move "jump to line" reliably, `openNote` bumps `navSeq` (part of the Editor remount `key`) on every nav.

**Styling is a verbatim port of the design system, not Tailwind-in-the-app.** `apps/desktop/src/styles.css` is the design's hand-written CSS (oklch token palette, themed via `[data-theme="light"|"dark"]`). Class names (`av-*`, `set-*`, `fnd-*`) are load-bearing — the React components reproduce the prototype's exact markup against them. Treat `styles.css` as the visual source of truth; don't casually refactor it into utility classes. (This applies to the **desktop app only**. The **landing** has been migrated to **Tailwind v4 utilities**: `apps/landing/src/styles.css` now holds just the oklch tokens — exposed to utilities via `@theme inline` so `bg-paper`/`text-ink`/`font-serif`/`text-accent` follow `data-theme` — plus `@theme` keyframes and a thin `@layer components` for the reusable/bespoke bits (`.wrap`, `.btn*`, the logo `.bmark`/`.wordtype`, keycast `.kc-*`, `.reveal`). Everything else is utilities in `app.tsx`. `--breakpoint-sm` is overridden to `45rem` to match the design's single 720px breakpoint, used via `max-sm:`.) Cross-cutting bits in the desktop `styles.css`: a `:focus-visible` accent ring (keyboard-only), a `prefers-reduced-motion` block, custom thin scrollbars (`scrollbar-width` + `::-webkit-scrollbar`, `--ink-faint`-derived thumb), and a trailing **legibility** layer that floors the smallest chrome font-sizes — every chrome `font-size` is `calc(Npx * var(--ui-scale))`.

**Window chrome is custom.** The Tauri window is `decorations: false` (see `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`). The in-app titlebar traffic lights drive close/minimize/maximize through `use-window-controls.ts` (`@tauri-apps/api/window`, dynamically imported and code-split). Outside Tauri (the landing's `?embed=1` iframe) those controls are inert and red falls back to closing the note buffer. `isTauri()` / the `embed` html class gate this; the same build runs both as the native app and as the embedded demo.

**Landing ↔ desktop coupling is the demo iframe only.** The landing embeds the desktop web build via `<iframe src={DEMO_URL}>`; in dev `DEMO_URL` points at the desktop Vite server, in prod at `/demo/` (populated by `pnpm demo:build`). Override with `VITE_DEMO_URL`. Deploys on Vercel via `vercel.json` (repo root): build = `pnpm build:landing` (builds the demo into `public/demo`, then the landing), output `apps/landing/dist`, **Root Directory = repo root** (a default `vite build` would ship an empty `/demo`).

**SEO + domains.** Landing → **noteside.app**, docs → **docs.noteside.app** (a _separate_ Vercel project, Root Directory = `apps/docs`, config `apps/docs/vercel.json` with the SPA-fallback rewrite). Landing SEO is static in `apps/landing/index.html` (canonical/OG/Twitter/theme-color + WebSite/SoftwareApplication JSON-LD) plus `public/robots.txt` + `public/sitemap.xml`. Docs SEO is per-page: `routes/docs.tsx`'s clientLoader component renders `<title>`/`<meta>`/canonical/OG/Twitter/JSON-LD in the body and **React 19 hoists them into the prerendered `<head>`** — do NOT add a route `meta()` (React 19 hoists but does NOT dedupe → duplicate tags). The docs sitemap is a prerendered resource route (`routes/sitemap.ts`, registered in `routes.ts` and pushed into `react-router.config.ts` `prerender()`); robots is static `public/robots.txt`. Canonical + sitemap URLs are clean directory paths with **no trailing slash** (root = `https://docs.noteside.app`). The **OG cards** (`apps/{landing,docs}/public/og.png`, 1200×630, opaque) render from `apps/desktop/scripts/og.html` via headless Chrome — regenerate with `pnpm og:build` (must be online; one template, `?variant=landing|docs`, `--force-device-scale-factor=1`). Attribution ("Josh Daniel" → github.com/joshxfi, the _personal_ profile) is in the landing footer, the README, and the root `package.json` `author`.

## Releases

**Releases are deliberate and batched — a manual GitHub Action, not per-push.** Run the **Release** workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`, `workflow_dispatch`; set the `dry_run` input to preview the version/notes) when you want to ship the desktop app; the landing/docs keep their own continuous Vercel cadence, so the two are decoupled. The pipeline: **semantic-release** (`.releaserc.json`, conventionalcommits preset) computes the version, writes `CHANGELOG.md`, bumps the version files, tags, and creates the GitHub Release; then a 4-target `tauri-action` matrix (macOS arm64/x64, `ubuntu-22.04` + `libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev`…, windows) attaches binaries to it. The CI gate (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs typecheck/lint/format/test + `cargo check`/`test` on PRs and pushes to main.

The version is **derived from conventional commits** (`feat`→minor, `fix`/`perf`/`polish`/`refactor`→patch, `feat!`/`BREAKING CHANGE`→major), so commit hygiene is load-bearing. `node scripts/bump-version.mjs <version>` is the single sync point — it regex-patches the `version` in **8 files**: `apps/desktop/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` (the binary's source of truth), `Cargo.toml`, the `noteside` entry in `Cargo.lock`, and the root + 4 app `package.json`s. Those `0.1.0`s are **placeholders semantic-release overwrites at release time — don't hand-bump them**; the first release auto-cuts `v1.0.0` (no prior tags). Keep evergreen prose version-agnostic and point download CTAs at `…/releases/latest`. Builds are currently **unsigned** (one-time Gatekeeper/SmartScreen prompt) with no auto-updater. Setup gotcha: the repo's _Settings → Actions → Workflow permissions_ must be **read+write**, or semantic-release can't push the tag/commit/release.

## Conventions & gotchas

- **TypeScript is strict** with `noUnusedLocals`, `noUnusedParameters`, and `verbatimModuleSyntax` (from `tsconfig.base.json`). Use `import type { … }` for type-only imports or the build breaks.
- **Source files are kebab-case** (`settings-panel.tsx`, `editing-session.ts`, `use-global-chords.ts`, `ex-commands.ts`) — never CamelCase. Exported component/identifier names stay PascalCase (`export function SettingsPanel`); only the _filename_ is kebab. `apps/docs` keeps React Router's own lowercase route-file convention. The macOS filesystem is case-insensitive, so a stale wrong-case import resolves locally but breaks the Linux CI build — rename with a two-step `git mv` and fix every import path.
- **The mock backend is an in-memory seed** (`src/data.ts`, used in browser dev / the landing demo); the real Tauri backend persists to Markdown files. Notebook scanning, atomic writes, and the watcher live in `src-tauri/src` (`notebook.rs`/`commands.rs`/`watcher.rs`); search stays fully in-memory (no database).
- **The desktop app bundles fonts locally** via `@fontsource` (`apps/desktop/src/fonts.ts`, imported for the `@font-face` side effects: Newsreader/Spectral serif, IBM Plex/JetBrains/Space mono) so it runs **fully offline** — no Google Fonts request on launch. The **landing + docs** are websites, so they load Newsreader + IBM Plex Mono from Google Fonts (`index.html` / `root.tsx`); the brand guide too. CSS stacks fall back to system serif/mono everywhere.
- **Tauri Rust is a single crate** at `apps/desktop/src-tauri` (no root cargo workspace). Turbo does not cache the Rust build — `desktop#build` is the _web_ bundle; `tauri build` is separate. Window-control permissions and `data-tauri-drag-region` are authorized in `src-tauri/capabilities/default.json` (window label `main`).
- **Toolchain: Node 24 + pnpm 11** (`.nvmrc`, `packageManager` in root `package.json`). pnpm 11 enforces a **supply-chain freshness gate** (`minimumReleaseAge: 1440` in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`) — if `pnpm install`/`pnpm <script>` fails with `ERR_PNPM_MINIMUM_RELEASE_AGE_VIOLATION`, a dependency was published <1 day ago. Wait for it to age, or allowlist that one package under `minimumReleaseAgeExclude` (never `minimum-release-age=0` globally). Dependency build scripts are also gated — approve trusted ones under `allowBuilds` (e.g. `esbuild`). When the gate blocks a `pnpm <script>` (pnpm 11 re-runs an install check first), run the tool binary directly to bypass it: `./apps/desktop/node_modules/.bin/vitest run --root apps/desktop` (vitest is package-local — not in the root `.bin`), `./node_modules/.bin/tsc --noEmit -p apps/desktop/tsconfig.json`, `./node_modules/.bin/oxlint apps/desktop/src`, `./node_modules/.bin/oxfmt --check apps/desktop/src`, `(cd apps/desktop && ./node_modules/.bin/tauri icon …)`, `cargo test --manifest-path apps/desktop/src-tauri/Cargo.toml`.
- **Editor theme/extension changes need a full reload, not HMR.** CM6 injects `EditorView.theme(...)` CSS as a static StyleModule and wires extensions at `EditorView` mount, so Vite HMR won't apply `editor/theme.ts` or extension edits to a running editor — restart/hard-reload to see them. Editor selection/cursor colors must use `!important` + CSS vars: CM's baseTheme defaults win on specificity and the theme isn't declared `dark`, so a plain `.cm-selectionBackground` rule loses (CM's light default `#d7d4f0` then shows in **both** themes).
