## Build commands

```
npm run build      # typecheck (tsc --noEmit) → esbuild bundle + zip
npm run dev        # typecheck → esbuild watch + serve on port 3000
```

Build order matters: typecheck must pass before esbuild runs. Output is `dist/main.js` → automatically zipped to `dist.zip` (the plugin artifact).

## Architecture

Acode plugin (Android WebView) that launches OpenCode as a background HTTP server inside Acode's built-in Alpine Linux terminal, then embeds its web UI in an iframe.

**Entrypoint:** `src/main.ts` → `AcodePlugin` class.

**Directory layout** - feature-based

**State machine** (`src/types.ts` — `AppState` enum): `Idle → CheckingInstall → Installing → CheckingServer → StartingServer → Ready`. Error can be entered from any state. UI is purely reactive via `onStateChange` listener.

## Hard constraints (non-negotiable)

- **Fixed port 4096, loopback only.** `opencode serve --port 4096 --hostname 127.0.0.1`. Never bind to `0.0.0.0` without adding auth.
- **Executor.execute is blocking AND session-reaping.** The terminal module resolves only after the command exits, and it treats the command as finished the moment its stdout pipe hits EOF — then tears down the shell session, reaping any backgrounded child. For persistent processes, use `Executor.BackgroundExecutor` (which persists across session teardown, returns a UUID via `start()`, and is stopped via `stop(uuid)`). `disown` is a bash-ism not available in BusyBox `ash` (Acode's Alpine shell).

## Code conventions

- **SOC** SEPERATION OF CONCERN (u MUST follow that rule)
- **No magic numbers/strings.** All constants live in `src/config/`. Import them — never inline literals. Consumers import from the specific sub-module (e.g. `./config/server`), not the barrel, except tests.
- **ESLint rules** (enforced when eslint is installed): `max-depth: 3`, `max-lines-per-function: 40` (warn), `no-magic-numbers` (warn, except 0,1,-1), `prefer-const`, `no-var`.
- **Prettier** (when installed): single quotes, trailing commas, 100 char width, 2-space tabs.
- **Untyped Acode modules** use `acode.require('...') as any` — this is the established pattern (acode-plugin-types doesn't cover all runtime modules).
- **State handling** uses the `AppState` enum and `transition()` instead of nested conditionals. Never add a state check without adding it to the enum.
- **Imports:** `config/` is a leaf package of pure constants — sub-modules import nothing outside `config/` (cross-config imports like `health.ts` ← `server.ts` are allowed; no imports from `../opencode`, `../ui`, etc.).

## Gotchas

- `eslint` and `prettier` packages are **not installed** (configs exist but are inert). Install them before running lint/format.
- Tests use Vitest with jsdom (`npm test`). Test files live under `test/`, mirroring the `src/` tree (e.g. `test/opencode/server.test.ts`), and import from `../src/...` / `../../src/...`. `vitest.config.ts` `include` is `test/**/*.test.ts`; tsconfig excludes `test/**/*`.
- `plugin.json` is configured for publishing: `id` `com.victozee26.opencode`, `name` `OpenCode`, `version` `0.1.0`, `main` `dist/main.js`, author set from git identity. Bump `version` + `changelogs.md` for each release.
- `html-tag-js` is listed as a dependency but currently unused — all DOM is vanilla `document.createElement`.
- Health-check uses `cordova.plugin.http` (Cordova Advanced HTTP) only — it runs on the native network stack so WebView CORS does NOT apply and a loopback probe to `127.0.0.1:4096` actually resolves (a plain `fetch` to loopback hangs forever in this WebView). There is NO `fetch` fallback: `isServerUp()` returns `false` immediately when `cordova.plugin.http` is absent, so tests stub `window.cordova.plugin.http` rather than relying on a browser `fetch`. Do not reintroduce a `fetch` probe. See `src/opencode/AGENTS.md`.

# DOX framework

- DOX is highly performant AGENTS.md hierarchy installed here
- Agent must follow DOX instructions across any edits

## Core Contract

- AGENTS.md files are binding work contracts for their subtrees
- Work products, source materials, instructions, records, assets, and durable docs must stay understandable from the nearest applicable AGENTS.md plus every parent AGENTS.md above it

## Read Before Editing

1. Read the root AGENTS.md
2. Identify every file or folder you expect to touch
3. Walk from the repository root to each target path
4. Read every AGENTS.md found along each route
5. If a parent AGENTS.md lists a child AGENTS.md whose scope contains the path, read that child and continue from there
6. Use the nearest AGENTS.md as the local contract and parent docs for repo-wide rules
7. If docs conflict, the closer doc controls local work details, but no child doc may weaken DOX

Do not rely on memory. Re-read the applicable DOX chain in the current session before editing.

## Update After Editing

Every meaningful change requires a DOX pass before the task is done.

Update the closest owning AGENTS.md when a change affects:

- purpose, scope, ownership, or responsibilities
- durable structure, contracts, workflows, or operating rules
- required inputs, outputs, permissions, constraints, side effects, or artifacts
- user preferences about behavior, communication, process, organization, or quality
- AGENTS.md creation, deletion, move, rename, or index contents

Update parent docs when parent-level structure, ownership, workflow, or child index changes. Update child docs when parent changes alter local rules. Remove stale or contradictory text immediately. Small edits that do not change behavior or contracts may leave docs unchanged, but the DOX pass still must happen.

## Hierarchy

- Root AGENTS.md is the DOX rail: project-wide instructions, global preferences, durable workflow rules, and the top-level Child DOX Index
- Child AGENTS.md files own domain-specific instructions and their own Child DOX Index
- Each parent explains what its direct children cover and what stays owned by the parent
- The closer a doc is to the work, the more specific and practical it must be

## Child Doc Shape

- Create a child AGENTS.md when a folder becomes a durable boundary with its own purpose, rules, responsibilities, workflow, materials, or quality standards
- Work Guidance must reflect the current standards of the project or user instructions; if there are no specific standards or instructions yet, leave it empty
- Verification must reflect an existing check; if no verification framework exists yet, leave it empty and update it when one exists

Default section order:
- Purpose
- Ownership
- Local Contracts
- Work Guidance
- Verification
- Child DOX Index

## Style

- Keep docs concise, current, and operational
- Document stable contracts, not diary entries
- Put broad rules in parent docs and concrete details in child docs
- Prefer direct bullets with explicit names
- Do not duplicate rules across many files unless each scope needs a local version
- Delete stale notes instead of explaining history
- Trim obvious statements, repeated rules, misplaced detail, and warnings for risks that no longer exist

## Closeout

1. Re-check changed paths against the DOX chain
2. Update nearest owning docs and any affected parents or children
3. Refresh every affected Child DOX Index
4. Remove stale or contradictory text
5. Run existing verification when relevant
6. Report any docs intentionally left unchanged and why

## User Preferences

- UI components are split by concern: one file per component under `src/ui/components/`, re-exported via `components/index.ts`. Never collapse them back into a single `components.ts`. (Requested 2026-07-15.)
- CSS is in external `.css` files under `src/ui/styles/` (one per component/domain), loaded via `<link>` in `initUiStyles()`. Components use `className` for static layout; dynamic values (position, transforms, config-dependent) stay as inline `element.style.*`. Never use `cssText` for static styles, and never add `<style>` elements in JS. (Established 2026-07-20.)
- Config constants are split by domain under `src/config/` (one file per concern: `server`, `opencode`, `health`, `ui`, `app`, `settings`, `update`) plus a barrel `index.ts`. Consumers import from the specific sub-module, never the barrel (tests may use the barrel). Never collapse them back into a single `config.ts`. (Requested 2026-07-15.)

When the user requests a durable behavior change, record it here or in the relevant child AGENTS.md

## Child DOX Index

- `src/opencode/AGENTS.md` — OpenCode lifecycle: install checks, installation, server start/stop/restart, health polling, update checking.
- `src/ui/AGENTS.md` — DOM rendering layer: render orchestrator per state, vanilla DOM component factories, external CSS styles loaded via `<link>`.
- `src/terminal/AGENTS.md` — Terminal abstraction wrapping global `Executor`.
- `src/config/AGENTS.md` — Named constants: domain split (server, opencode, health, ui, app, settings, update), barrel, leaf-import rule.
- `src/main.ts`, `src/types.ts`, `src/state.ts`, `src/logger.ts`, `src/error.ts`, `src/settings.ts` — Cross-cutting infrastructure owned directly by root AGENTS.md. `main.ts` (`AcodePlugin`) init reads `getLogLevel()` → `setLogLevel` (runtime log gate, `none` disables all logs, default `none`); wires live UI handlers: `setOnScaleChange` → `updateIframeScale`, `setOnHideHeaderChange` → `applyHeaderVisibility` (global chrome, landscape gated via `body` class; see `src/ui/AGENTS.md`), and tears down orientation listeners via `destroyOrientationListener()` on `destroy()` (idempotent, no duplicate registration on re-init). `settings.ts` owns the native plugin settings schema (`getSettingsSchema`) and live `acode.require('settings')` getters plus `setOn*Change` callbacks for `iframeScale`, `logLevel` (→ `setLogLevel`, includes `none`), and `hideHeaderInLandscape`. Auto-start and enableConsoleLogs settings removed; plugin auto-starts on page show when not already running and logging is controlled solely via `logLevel`.
- `test/` — Vitest + jsdom suite mirroring `src/` (e.g. `test/opencode/server.test.ts`, `test/ui/headerLandscape.test.ts`, `test/main-headerLandscape.test.ts`), imports from `../src/...` / `../../src/...`; stubs `window.cordova.plugin.http` for health probes (no `fetch` fallback), `window.matchMedia`/`innerWidth`/`innerHeight` for landscape, and `acode.require('settings')` for header visibility. No `test/AGENTS.md`.
- `docs/acode-plugin-api-reference.md` — Acode plugin API reference relevant to this project.
