# AI Coding Agent Guidelines

**Project:** Aletheia-Probe - Journal and Conference Assessment Tool
**Purpose:** Explicit instructions for AI coding assistants
**Supported Agents:** All AI coding assistants

**Note:** This project actively encourages the use of AI coding agents in development. Your contributions are valued as tools to aid problem-solving, code generation, review, and learning.

## 0. Agent Communication Guidelines

**IMPORTANT:** Follow these communication rules:

- **NEVER** mention your specific agent name (Claude, Gemini, etc.) in commits, PRs, or code
- **NEVER** add co-author attribution for AI agents
- **DO** use the tag `[AI-assisted]` when appropriate in comments or PR descriptions
- Focus on the technical content, not the tool used to create it

---

## 1. Development Process Workflow

Follow this process for ALL development work:

### Step-by-Step Workflow

1. **Start from main branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. **Identify the task**
   - Observe what needs to be done (typically: resolve an issue)
   - Review the issue details and requirements

3. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b fix-issue-<number>-<description>
   ```

4. **Develop, fix, and test**
   - The user will typically hint you to a issue on github, using:
     "work on issue#<ISSUE-NUMBER>". Use the "gh" tool to access the issue.
   - Make your changes following all coding standards
   - Write or update tests as needed
   - Test locally during development

5. **Run all tests**
   ```bash
   scripts/with-venv.sh bash scripts/run-quality-checks.sh
   ```
   - ALL checks MUST pass before proceeding

6. **Commit your changes**
   - Follow conventional commit format
   - Write clear commit messages explaining WHY the changes were made

7. **Create a Pull Request**
   - Push your branch to GitHub
   - Create PR with proper description (see section 4 below)
   - Link the PR to the issue

8. **Review cycle**
   - Human reviewer will provide feedback
   - If there are comments or requested changes: **Go back to step 4**
   - Address all feedback and repeat steps 4-7 as needed

9. **Post-merge cleanup**
   - After PR is merged, run cleanup script:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/post-pr-merge.sh
   ```
   - This cleans up everything locally and prepares for next task

---

## 2. Issues / Code Review

When creating issues, e.g. during a code review:

- include the exact problem description
- be short, be precise
- only include one problem in one issue
- do not include the solution
- simple but technical language
- always display the issue before it is posted to get human assessment

---

## 3. Before Making ANY Changes (MANDATORY)

Read and follow ALL standards in:

- **`dev-notes/CODING_STANDARDS.md`** - All coding conventions, patterns, code smells to avoid
- **`dev-notes/LOGGING_USAGE.md`** - Dual-logger system usage
- **`dev-notes/DEPENDENCIES.md`** - Dependencies information
- **`dev-notes/NORMALIZED_DATABASE_DESIGN.md`** - Database schema (if working with data)
- **`dev-notes/integration/*.md`** - Data sources (if working with backends)

Also:
- Review recent commits to understand current patterns
- Check open issues and PRs for ongoing work
- Remember: This tool affects real academic decisions - quality is paramount

---

## 4. Pre-Commit Workflow (MANDATORY)

Before ANY commit, run:

```bash
scripts/with-venv.sh bash scripts/run-quality-checks.sh
```

Virtual environment note:
- In non-interactive agent shells, your active terminal venv may not be inherited in `PATH`.
- Run Python tooling via `scripts/with-venv.sh` to ensure the project venv is activated first.
- `scripts/with-venv.sh` requires `VIRTUAL_ENV` to be set; activate the environment first.

**Requirements:**
- ALL checks MUST pass
- Do NOT commit failing code
- Do NOT bypass checks
- Do NOT use `type: ignore` without justification

---

## 5. Commit and PR Format

### Commits

Follow conventional commits (see `git log` for examples):

```
<type>: <subject ≤72 chars>

<WHY, not just WHAT>
```

Types: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `refactor:`, `chore:`

### Pull Requests

Include:
- **Summary**: What does this do?
- **Motivation**: Why is this needed?
- **Testing**: How was this tested?
- **Checklist**: Quality checks pass, tests added, docs updated

---

## 6. Summary Checklist

✅ **DO:**
1. Read all `dev-notes/` documentation first
2. Run `scripts/with-venv.sh bash scripts/run-quality-checks.sh` before committing
3. Follow CODING_STANDARDS.md (simplicity, f-strings, type hints, enums, imports at top, etc.)
4. Follow LOGGING_USAGE.md (dual-logger system)
5. Write tests for new functionality
6. Add docstrings (Google style)
7. Write clear commit messages explaining WHY
8. Place all imports at the top of files per PEP 8 (unless needed for circular import workarounds)

❌ **DO NOT:**
1. Commit code that fails quality checks
2. Modify code you don't understand
3. Introduce code smells (see CODING_STANDARDS.md)
4. Add unnecessary dependencies
5. Use backwards-compatibility hacks

**When uncertain, ask for clarification.**

---

## 7. Git and Version Control Guidelines

**IMPORTANT Git Rules:**
- **ALWAYS** use specific filenames when adding to git, NEVER use patterns or directories
- **NEVER** reference any specific agent name (Claude, Gemini, etc.) in commit messages
- **NEVER** reference any agent name in any part of source code or documentation
- **DO** use `[AI-assisted]` tag when appropriate in commit messages

---

## 8. GitHub PR Comment Replies

To reply to PR review comments on GitHub:

```bash
# Reply to a specific review comment using the comment ID
gh api --method POST repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pr_number}/comments/{comment_id}/replies --field body="Your reply message [AI-assisted]"

# Example:
gh api --method POST repos/sustainet-guardian/aletheia-probe/pulls/28/comments/2544706229/replies --field body="Fixed! Removed the unrelated cache TTL entry from the changelog. [AI-assisted]"
```

**Important notes:**
- Use the `/replies` endpoint to reply to existing review comments
- The `comment_id` must be a top-level review comment (not a reply to a reply)
- Always include the `[AI-assisted]` tag in replies
- Find comment IDs using: `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pr_number}/comments`
