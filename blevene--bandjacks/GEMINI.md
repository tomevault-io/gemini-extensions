## Database Initialization & Data Loading

### Neo4j Schema Setup

The system automatically creates comprehensive Neo4j constraints and indexes on startup via `ensure_ddl()`:

**Constraints (44 total)** - Ensuring uniqueness for:
- Core STIX nodes: `AttackPattern`, `IntrusionSet`, `Software`, `Mitigation`, `Tactic`
- Operational nodes: `AttackEpisode`, `AttackAction`, `AttackFlow`
- Detection nodes: `DetectionStrategy`, `Analytic`, `LogSource`, `SigmaRule`
- Defense nodes: `D3fendTechnique`, `DigitalArtifact`
- Review/ML nodes: `CandidateAttackPattern`, `ReviewProvenance`, `JudgeVerdict`

**Indexes (100+)** - Performance optimization for:
- Name and ID lookups across all node types
- Temporal queries (created, modified, timestamp)
- Status fields (revoked, deprecated, status)
- Categorical fields (platforms, tactics, type)

### OpenSearch Index Creation

Three primary indexes with KNN vector support (768 dimensions):

**1. attack_patterns index**
```json
{
  "knn": true,
  "properties": {
    "stix_id": "keyword",
    "embedding": {
      "type": "knn_vector",
      "dimension": 768,
      "method": "hnsw"
    }
  }
}
```

**2. attack_flows index** - For flow similarity search
**3. attack_edges index** - For relationship embeddings
**4. reports index** - For document storage and search

### Redis Configuration

Redis serves as the distributed job store with:
- Job queue management (`job:queue`)
- Processing state tracking (`job:processing`)
- Worker heartbeats for failure detection
- Distributed locking for atomic operations
- Default configuration: `localhost:6379`, DB 0

### STIX Data Ingestion Process

**1. Load ATT&CK Data via API:**
```bash
# Load latest enterprise ATT&CK
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/v1/stix/load/attack?collection=enterprise-attack&version=latest&adm_strict=false"

# Load specific version with strict validation
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/v1/stix/load/attack?collection=enterprise-attack&version=14.1&adm_strict=true"
```

**2. Ingestion Workflow:**
1. **Bundle Resolution**: Fetches from official ATT&CK catalog index
2. **ADM Validation**: Validates STIX objects against ATT&CK Data Model
3. **Neo4j Population**: Creates nodes for techniques, groups, software, mitigations
4. **Relationship Creation**: USES, MITIGATES, HAS_TACTIC edges
5. **Embedding Generation**: Creates 768-dim vectors for each technique
6. **OpenSearch Indexing**: Stores embeddings for vector search
7. **Cache Warming**: Loads TechniqueCache and ActorCache

**3. Embedding Generation:**
- Combines name, description, detection, tactics, platforms
- Includes T-numbers for better search matching
- Uses Sentence Transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2 or similar)
- Stored in OpenSearch for KNN similarity search

**4. Provenance Tracking:**
Every loaded object includes:
```json
{
  "source_collection": "enterprise-attack",
  "source_version": "14.1",
  "source_modified": "2024-04-23T00:00:00.000Z",
  "source_url": "https://...",
  "adm_spec": "3.3.0"
}
```

## Report Extraction & Attack Flow Modeling

### Extraction Pipeline

The system uses a multi-agent LLM pipeline to extract structured threat intelligence:

#### **1. Text Processing**
- **PDF Extraction**: Uses `pdfplumber` for high-quality text extraction
- **Chunking**: Large documents split into 3KB overlapping chunks for processing
- **Preprocessing**: Handles single-line text by splitting on sentence boundaries

#### **2. Span Detection** (`SpanFinderAgent`)
- **Pattern-based**: Detects explicit technique IDs (T1566.001) and behavioral patterns
- **Tactic-aware**: Uses regex patterns for each MITRE tactic (recon, execution, persistence, etc.)
- **Scoring**: Confidence-based filtering with deduplication

#### **3. Technique Mapping** (`BatchMapperAgent`)
- **Vector Search**: Uses OpenSearch KNN to find candidate techniques
- **LLM Verification**: Batch processes all spans in single LLM call for efficiency
- **Multi-extraction**: Extracts ALL relevant techniques per span (not just one)

#### **4. Evidence Consolidation** (`ConsolidatorAgent`)
- **Deduplication**: Merges techniques found across multiple spans
- **Confidence Aggregation**: Combines evidence from different text locations
- **Line Reference Tracking**: Maintains provenance to source text

### Attack Flow Generation

The system creates temporal sequences using multiple approaches:

#### **1. LLM-Based Sequence Synthesis** (`AttackFlowSynthesizer`)
```python
# Analyzes temporal phrases, causal relationships, and narrative flow
llm_flow = synthesize_attack_flow(
    extraction_result=extraction_data,
    report_text=report_text,
    max_steps=25
)
```

**Capabilities**:
- Temporal keyword detection ("first", "then", "next", "finally")
- Causal relationship inference from report narrative
- Evidence-backed step placement with reasoning
- Up to 25 sequenced attack steps

#### **2. Heuristic Sequential Ordering** (`FlowBuilder._order_steps()`)
- **Kill Chain Ordering**: Maps tactics to MITRE sequence (recon→access→execution→persistence...)
- **Temporal Prioritization**: Weights techniques by temporal indicators in descriptions
- **Confidence Weighting**: Prioritizes high-confidence extractions

#### **3. Probabilistic Edge Generation**
```python
# NEXT edges with probabilities 0.1-1.0 based on:
probability = self._calculate_probability(action1, action2)
# - Historical adjacency patterns in Neo4j
# - Tactic alignment/progression
# - Confidence scores
# - Temporal indicators
```

#### **4. Fallback Co-occurrence Modeling**
When sequential evidence is lacking:
- **Tactic-grouped clustering**: Creates edges within tactic groups
- **Cross-tactic bridging**: Connects adjacent tactics in kill chain
- **Sparse connectivity**: Avoids edge explosion with hub-and-spoke patterns

### Flow Types Generated

#### **Sequential Flows** (when evidence supports temporal order):
- **STIX Attack Flow objects** with ordered actions
- **AttackEpisode/AttackAction nodes** in Neo4j
- **NEXT edges** with probabilities and rationale
- **Evidence provenance** linking back to source text spans

#### **Co-occurrence Flows** (for intrusion sets, some campaigns):
- **Technique clustering** by shared tactics
- **Weak probabilistic edges** indicating co-occurrence
- **Explicitly marked** as `flow_type="co-occurrence"`

### Current Capabilities

✅ **Extract 10-15 techniques** from complex threat reports
✅ **Generate temporal sequences** when narrative evidence exists
✅ **Create probabilistic flows** with NEXT edge probabilities
✅ **Handle large documents** via chunked async processing
✅ **Maintain evidence provenance** throughout pipeline
✅ **Support both individual and batch processing**

### Limitations & Future Enhancements

❌ **Limited temporal NLP**: Basic keyword detection, could use advanced temporal parsers
❌ **Static tactic ordering**: Could learn from historical attack patterns
❌ **No ML sequence models**: Could train on attack flow datasets
❌ **Simple co-occurrence patterns**: Could use graph ML for better edge inference

## Key Design Decisions

- **ATT&CK release pinning**: Use official `index.json` catalog for version control
- **ADM-gated validation**: All STIX content must pass ATT&CK Data Model validation
- **Dual representation**: RDF/OWL for semantics, Neo4j property graph for analytics
- **TTP-centric**: Focus on behaviors, IOCs out of scope except for context
- **Hybrid retrieval**: Vector KNN to seed candidates, graph for precise linking
- **Attack Flow first-class**: Materialized as STIX extension and graph structure
- **Provenance tracking**: Every node/edge stamped with source metadata
- **No downgrades**: Prevent accidental version rollbacks unless forced
- **TechniqueCache singleton**: Loads all ~1376 ATT&CK techniques at startup for O(1) lookups
  - Eliminates database queries during extraction pipeline
  - Ensures consistent human-readable names (e.g., "Adversary-in-the-Middle" instead of "T1557")
  - Thread-safe implementation shared across all workers
  - Loaded once from Neo4j with tactics, platforms, and metadata

## Graph Schema

### Node Types

Primary node types:
- **Report** - Threat intelligence reports with extracted content
- **AttackPattern** - Techniques & sub-techniques with `x_mitre_is_subtechnique`
- **Tactic**, **IntrusionSet**, **Software**, **Mitigation**, **Campaign** - Core STIX entities
- **DataSource**, **DataComponent** - Detection components
- **AttackEpisode**, **AttackAction** - Attack flow operational nodes
- **D3fendTechnique**, **DigitalArtifact** - Defense overlay

### Relationship Types

#### Report-to-Entity Relationships (Native Graph Traversal)
- **EXTRACTED_ENTITY** - Report→Entity (generic relationship)
- **IDENTIFIED_ACTOR** - Report→IntrusionSet (threat actors)
- **EXTRACTED_MALWARE** - Report→Software[type=malware]
- **MENTIONS_TOOL** - Report→Software[type=tool]
- **DESCRIBES_CAMPAIGN** - Report→Campaign
- **EXTRACTED_TECHNIQUE** - Report→AttackPattern
- **HAS_FLOW** - Report→AttackEpisode {step_count, flow_type}

#### Entity and Flow Relationships
- **USES** - Group→Technique, Software→Technique
- **HAS_TACTIC** - Technique→Tactic via kill_chain_phases
- **MITIGATES** - Mitigation→Technique
- **CONTAINS** - AttackEpisode→AttackAction (structural)
- **NEXT** {probability, reasoning} - AttackAction→AttackAction
- **COUNTERS** - D3fendTechnique→Technique/AttackAction

### Core Properties

All nodes include:
- `stix_id`, `type`, `name`, `description`, `created`, `modified`, `revoked`
- `source`: `{collection, version, modified, url, adm_spec, adm_sha}`
- `confidence` (extracted entities)
- `source_report` (entities linked to reports)

### Migration for Native Relationships

For existing data using property-based connections, run:
```bash
python migrations/add_native_relationships.py
```
This creates all native relationships for existing entities and flows.

## Report Processing Architecture

### Sync vs Async Processing

The system intelligently routes reports based on size:

#### **Synchronous Processing** (< 5KB content)
```bash
POST /v1/reports/ingest        # Text/URL ingestion
POST /v1/reports/ingest/upload # File upload
```
- **Immediate response** with full results
- **Optimal for**: Small reports, quick analysis
- **Timeout**: 2 minutes maximum

#### **Asynchronous Processing** (> 5KB content) 
```bash
POST /v1/reports/ingest_async      # Text/URL async
POST /v1/reports/ingest_file_async # File async
GET  /v1/reports/jobs/{job_id}/status # Poll job status
```
- **Immediate job ID** response for progress tracking  
- **Background processing** with chunked extraction
- **No timeouts**: Can handle large PDFs (15KB+)
- **Real-time updates** via status polling

#### **Job Status Tracking**
```json
{
  "job_id": "job-abc123",
  "status": "processing",  // pending|processing|completed|failed
  "progress": 60,
  "message": "Processing chunk 3/6",
  "result": {
    "techniques_count": 12,
    "chunks_processed": 3
  }
}
```

#### **Batch CLI Processing**
```bash
# Process directory of PDFs
python -m bandjacks.cli.batch_extract ./reports/

# Use async API with 5 workers  
python -m bandjacks.cli.batch_extract --api --workers 5 ./reports/

# Custom chunking parameters
python -m bandjacks.cli.batch_extract --chunk-size 4000 --max-chunks 15 ./reports/
```

**Performance**: Successfully processes full threat reports (15KB PDFs) in ~30-60 seconds with 12+ techniques extracted.

## Unified Review System

After extraction, reports enter a comprehensive review system where human analysts validate all extracted items in a single interface:

### **Review Architecture**
- **Single Interface**: Combined review of entities, techniques, and flow steps
- **Universal Item Model**: All extractions converted to `ReviewableItem` format
- **Atomic Operations**: All decisions saved together in single transaction
- **Evidence-Based**: Direct links to source text with line references

### **Key Components**
```typescript
// Frontend Components (ui/components/reports/)
- unified-review.tsx        // Main review interface with tabs
- review-item-card.tsx      // Universal item card component
- review-progress.tsx       // Visual progress tracking
- review-utils.ts          // State management utilities

// Backend API
POST /v1/reports/{id}/unified-review  // Submit all review decisions
```

### **Review Workflow**
```typescript
// Convert extractions to reviewable format
const reviewableItems = [
  ...entitiesToReviewableItems(report.extraction.entities),
  ...claimsToReviewableItems(report.extraction.claims),  
  ...flowStepsToReviewableItems(report.extraction.flow.steps)
];

// Collect decisions
const decisions = reviewableItems.map(item => ({
  item_id: item.id,           // "entity-malware-0", "technique-5", "flow-step-123"
  action: "approve|reject|edit",
  edited_value?: {...},       // Modified item data
  confidence_adjustment?: number,
  notes?: string
}));

// Submit atomically
await api.submitUnifiedReview(reportId, { decisions, globalNotes });
```

- **Chunked Processing**: Handles 15KB+ PDFs without timeouts
- **Parallel Workers**: Batch CLI supports concurrent processing
- **Caching**: Common technique lookups cached for efficiency
- **Progressive Results**: Techniques displayed as they're found
- **LLM Cost Tracking**: Every LLM call records tokens and cost via `litellm.completion_cost()`. Per-report costs in extraction metrics, daily aggregates at `GET /v1/costs/stats`
- **Mapper Batch Size**: `MAX_MAPPER_BATCH_SIZE` env var (default 25) controls spans per LLM call. Higher = fewer calls but larger prompts
- **Pre-filter**: Before the LLM mapper, spans are limited to `max_spans_per_technique` (default 2) per candidate technique. Reduces mapper calls ~46% with minimal technique loss. Set to 0 to disable
- **Span Dedup** (opt-in): `enable_span_dedup: true` in config removes exact-duplicate span text before mapping. Saves ~40% spans but may lose ~15% of techniques. Disabled by default

### Extraction Config Options

```python
config = {
    "max_spans_per_technique": 2,     # Pre-filter: max spans per candidate technique (0=disabled, default=2)
    "enable_span_dedup": False,       # Text-based span deduplication (default=False)
    "max_spans": 0,                   # Hard cap on total spans (0=unlimited)
    "skip_entity_extraction": False,  # Skip entity extraction phase
    "disable_discovery": False,       # Skip LLM discovery for low-confidence spans
    "skip_verification": False,       # Skip evidence verification
}
```

## Important Notes

- **Defensive security focus**: Designed for threat analysis and defense only
- **TTP-centric**: No IOC lifecycle management (out of scope)
- **Strict validation**: All STIX content must pass ADM validation
- **Version control**: ATT&CK releases are pinned, no accidental downgrades
- **Analyst-in-the-loop**: Designed for review and feedback integration
- **Production ready**: Handles real-world CTI reports with robust error handling
