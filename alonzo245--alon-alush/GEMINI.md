## Code Implementation Guidelines

Follow these rules when you write code:

-   **Use early returns whenever possible** to make the code more readable.
-   **Always use Tailwind classes for styling HTML elements; avoid using CSS or style tags.**
-   **Use "class:" instead of the ternary operator in class tags whenever possible** (prefer `clsx` with object syntax).
-   **Use descriptive variable and function/const names.** Also, event functions should be named with a "handle" prefix, like `handleClick` for onClick and `handleKeyDown` for onKeyDown.
-   **Implement accessibility features on elements.** For example, a tag should have `tabIndex="0"`, `aria-label`, `onClick`, and `onKeyDown`, and similar attributes.
-   **Use consts instead of functions**, for example, `const toggle = () => {}`. Also, define a type if possible.

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript

-   Always use TypeScript for new files
-   Define explicit types for props, state, and function parameters
-   Use interfaces for object shapes
-   Avoid `any` - use `unknown` or proper types instead
-   Use type inference where appropriate but be explicit for public APIs
-   Always define types when possible, especially for function parameters and return values

### React Patterns

-   Use functional components only
-   Prefer hooks over class components
-   Use React 19 features (use() hook, Server Components where applicable)
-   Keep components small and focused (single responsibility)
-   Extract reusable logic into custom hooks
-   Use React.memo() for expensive components when needed
-   **Use const arrow functions instead of function declarations**: `const Component = () => {}` instead of `function Component() {}`
-   **Event handlers should be named with "handle" prefix**: `handleClick`, `handleKeyDown`, `handleSubmit`, etc.
-   **Use early returns whenever possible** to make code more readable and reduce nesting

### Component Guidelines

#### Design System Components (`components/`)

-   Must be reusable and accessible
-   Use React Aria Components for interactive elements
-   Style with Tailwind CSS utility classes
-   Use `clsx` for conditional className management
-   Export as named exports
-   Include TypeScript types
-   Follow mobile-first design principles
-   Include proper ARIA attributes

#### Feature Components (`routes/` or `features/`)

-   Page-level components
-   Can use design system components
-   Should be route-specific or feature-specific

### Accessibility (A11y)

-   **Always use React Aria Components** for interactive elements (Button, Link, etc.)
-   Use semantic HTML (`<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<nav>`, `<header>`)
-   Proper heading hierarchy (h1 → h2 → h3, no skipping levels)
-   **Implement accessibility features on all interactive elements**:
    -   Add `tabIndex="0"` for keyboard navigation
    -   Add `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` for screen readers
    -   Add `onClick` and `onKeyDown` handlers for keyboard interaction
    -   Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible
-   Add `aria-label`, `aria-labelledby`, `aria-describedby` where needed
-   Use `aria-hidden="true"` for decorative icons/images
-   Ensure keyboard navigation works for all interactive elements
-   Add focus styles for keyboard users
-   Use `role` attributes only when semantic HTML isn't sufficient
-   Test with screen readers

### State Management

#### Global State (Zustand)

-   Use `useAppStore` from `store/useAppStore.ts` for global application state
-   Keep stores focused and modular
-   Use TypeScript interfaces for store state
-   Prefer computed values over storing derived state

#### URL State (nuqs)

-   Use `useQueryStates` from `nuqs` for URL-based state
-   Define parsers in `core/utils/nuqs.ts`
-   Keep URL state minimal and meaningful

#### Server State (TanStack Query)

-   Use TanStack Query hooks for all API calls
-   Define queries in `core/api/queries/`
-   Use proper query keys for cache management
-   Handle loading and error states appropriately

### Styling

#### Tailwind CSS

-   **Always use Tailwind classes for styling HTML elements; avoid using CSS or style tags**
-   Use utility classes, not custom CSS when possible
-   Use `clsx` for conditional classes
-   **Use "class:" instead of the ternary operator in class tags whenever possible** (prefer `clsx` with object syntax)
-   Follow mobile-first responsive design
-   Use Tailwind's spacing scale consistently
-   Custom colors defined in `tailwind.config.js`
-   Use arbitrary values sparingly (`text-[60px]` only when needed)

#### CSS Files

-   Avoid custom CSS files when possible
-   If needed, use CSS modules or styled-components patterns
-   Keep styles co-located with components

### File Naming

-   Components: PascalCase (`Home.tsx`, `Navigation.tsx`)
-   Hooks: camelCase with `use` prefix (`useGlobalState.ts`, `useScreenSize.ts`)
-   Utils: camelCase (`nuqs.ts`, `formatDate.ts`)
-   Types: PascalCase (`User.ts`, `GitHubProject.ts`)
-   Constants: camelCase (`config.ts`, `user.ts`)
-   **Use descriptive variable and function/const names** - names should clearly indicate purpose

### Imports

-   Group imports: React → external libraries → internal modules
-   Use absolute imports when configured, otherwise relative imports
-   Import types with `import type` when importing only types
-   Order: default imports, then named imports

### Error Handling

-   Use error boundaries for component error handling
-   Handle API errors in TanStack Query error callbacks
-   Display user-friendly error messages
-   Log errors appropriately (don't expose sensitive info)

### Performance

-   Use `React.memo()` for expensive components
-   Use `useMemo()` and `useCallback()` when appropriate
-   Lazy load routes with `React.lazy()`

-   Use responsive design with a mobile-first approach
-   Optimize images: use WebP format when possible, include size data, implement lazy loading with `loading="lazy"`
-   Use `React.memo()`, `useMemo()`, and `useCallback()` appropriately for performance

### Error Handling and Validation

-   Prioritize error handling and edge cases
-   Use early returns for error conditions
-   Implement guard clauses to handle preconditions and invalid states early
-   Use custom error types for consistent error handling
-   Handle API errors gracefully with user-friendly messages

-   **Avoid enums**; use maps or const objects instead for better type safety and flexibility
-   Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces
-   Define explicit return types for functions when they add clarity
-   Use type guards for runtime type checking

### Code Organization Principles

-   **Organize files systematically**: each file should contain only related content, such as exported components, subcomponents, helpers, static content, and types
-   Keep related functionality together
-   Separate concerns: components, hooks, utilities, types
-   Use index files for clean exports when appropriate
-   Favor iteration and modularization to adhere to DRY principles and avoid code duplication

### Naming Conventions (Enhanced)

-   Use PascalCase for component files (`Home.tsx`, `Navigation.tsx`)
-   Use camelCase for utilities, hooks, and functions (`useGlobalState.ts`, `formatDate.ts`)
-   Use lowercase with dashes for directory names when organizing by feature (e.g., `components/auth-wizard`, `features/user-profile`)
-   Favor named exports for functions and components
-   Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., `isLoading`, `hasError`, `hasData`, `canEdit`, `shouldRender`)

### Advanced Performance Optimization

#### Code Splitting and Lazy Loading

-   Leverage `React.lazy()` for dynamic imports and code splitting
-   Wrap lazy-loaded components in `Suspense` with a fallback UI
-   Use dynamic loading for non-critical components and routes
-   Implement optimized chunking strategy during build process (Vite/Webpack)
-   Split vendor bundles from application code
-   Use route-based code splitting for better performance

#### Image Optimization (Enhanced)

-   Use WebP format when possible for better compression
-   Include size data (width/height) to prevent layout shift (CLS)
-   Implement lazy loading with `loading="lazy"` for images below the fold
-   Use responsive images with `srcset` when appropriate
-   Optimize image delivery with proper formats and compression
-   Consider using Next.js Image component patterns if migrating

#### Web Vitals Optimization

-   **Optimize Core Web Vitals** (LCP, CLS, FID/INP) using tools like Lighthouse or WebPageTest
-   Minimize Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) by optimizing images, fonts, and critical CSS
-   Reduce Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) by setting image dimensions and avoiding dynamic content insertion
-   Improve First Input Delay (FID) / Interaction to Next Paint (INP) by reducing JavaScript execution time
-   Monitor and measure performance regularly
-   Use React DevTools Profiler to identify performance bottlenecks

#### React-Specific Optimizations

-   Use `React.memo()` for expensive components that receive stable props
-   Use `useMemo()` for expensive computations
-   Use `useCallback()` for stable function references passed to child components
-   Avoid unnecessary re-renders by optimizing dependencies
-   Use React DevTools Profiler to identify performance bottlenecks
-   Minimize bundle size by removing unused code and dependencies

## Notes

-   Always prioritize accessibility
-   Mobile-first design approach
-   Keep components small and focused
-   Use TypeScript strictly
-   Follow the established project structure
-   When in doubt, check existing code patterns
-   If unsure about an answer, say so instead of guessing
