# AGENTS Guide

This repository bundles minimal history-oriented plugins for Operaton and Camunda 7 Cockpit/Tasklist. TypeScript + React sources in `src/` are bundled with Rollup into top-level `*.js` files that Cockpit loads via `config.js`.

**Note:** Built JavaScript modules are committed to the repository for convenience. Users can deploy the plugins directly without running the build process.

**Plugin status legend** used throughout this document:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **shipped** | Referenced from a `*config.js` and/or bundled by the [Dockerfile](Dockerfile). This is what users actually run. |
| **optional** | Built and committed, but not referenced by the default configs. Users opt in by adding it to their own `config.js`. |
| **abandoned** | Sources and bundle are kept for reference only. Not referenced by any config, not bundled by the Dockerfile, and not maintained. Do not invest in it. |

A source file existing under `src/` does **not** mean the plugin is shipped — always cross-check
[config.js](config.js), the other `*config.js` files, and the [Dockerfile](Dockerfile).

## Project map

### Configuration and deployment
- [README.md](README.md): Usage and deployment instructions
- [config.js](config.js): Cockpit plugin configuration (defines `customScripts` and `bpmnJs.additionalModules`)

### Plugin entrypoints (`src/`)
- [src/admin-custom-styles.tsx](src/admin-custom-styles.tsx): Minimal plugin that applies custom stylesheets (SCSS) for Admin UI customization.
- [src/admin-nologin.tsx](src/admin-nologin.tsx): Admin no-login plugin that hides the signin form with CSS. For environments with external authentication (SSO, reverse proxy).
- [src/admin-route-authorization.tsx](src/admin-route-authorization.tsx): Admin authorization management route. Two-panel layout with resource type list and authorization CRUD operations.
- [src/cockpit-custom-styles.tsx](src/cockpit-custom-styles.tsx): Minimal plugin that only applies custom stylesheets (SCSS) for UI customization without any JavaScript functionality.
- [src/cockpit-nologin.tsx](src/cockpit-nologin.tsx): Cockpit no-login plugin that hides the signin form with CSS. For environments with external authentication (SSO, reverse proxy).
- [src/dashboard-favourites.tsx](src/dashboard-favourites.tsx): Process definition favorites plugin. Adds a star button on process definition runtime views to favorite/unfavorite definitions, and provides a dashboard table showing favorited process definitions with version info and direct links.
- [src/dashboard-integrations.tsx](src/dashboard-integrations.tsx): Cockpit dashboard section listing external tasks that carry an incident or are held by a worker (process, task, topic, worker, lock time, retries), with retry and unlock actions for individual tasks and batches. Loads in three bounded requests — the favourites filter goes into the external task query, definitions come back in one `processDefinitionIdIn` lookup and incidents in one `processDefinitionKeyIn` lookup. Reuses the favourites stored by `dashboard-favourites` (`minimal-history-plugin-favourites`) to offer a favourites-only filter, on by default.
- [src/decisions-dashboard.tsx](src/decisions-dashboard.tsx): **Abandoned.** DMN "Decision Simulator" dashboard (`cockpit.decisions.dashboard`). See [Abandoned plugins](#abandoned-plugins) before touching it.
- [src/definition-historic-activities.tsx](src/definition-historic-activities.tsx): Adds a runtime tab and diagram overlay for historic activity statistics with a filter UI and badge overlays. One `finished` predicate feeds the table, the badges and the heat, so they cannot report different numbers for the same element; the fetch over-fetches by one to detect the result cap (`capToLimit`), is cancelled on teardown so a slow response for an old filter cannot overwrite a newer one, and reports failures instead of rejecting into the void. Three plugin points, one component: the diagram and tab points only stash their handles in a module-level `hooks` object, and the component mounting at `runtime.action` adopts the tab node (`statistics.appendChild(root)`) and portals into it. That is why one fetch feeds the filter box, the table, the badges and the heatmap alike — editing the filter moves all of them.
- [src/definition-tab-modify.tsx](src/definition-tab-modify.tsx): Process definition "Modify" tab hosting three batch operations against a definition: `BatchModifyForm` (Batch Modify), `BatchMessageForm` (Message) and `BatchSignalForm` (Signal). All three target instances through the shared helpers in
[src/utils/batchOperations.ts](src/utils/batchOperations.ts) and preview the request they would send — see
[Dangerous operations and dry runs](#dangerous-operations-and-dry-runs).
- [src/instance-action-unlock.tsx](src/instance-action-unlock.tsx): Process instance action button that provides a dialog for unlocking external tasks that are locked by workers, with batch selection and individual retry capabilities.
- [src/instance-auto-refresh.tsx](src/instance-auto-refresh.tsx): Diagram plugin exposing a toggle for auto-refresh on an instance view.
- [src/instance-historic-activities.tsx](src/instance-historic-activities.tsx): Adds audit-log tab and diagram overlays for a process instance, including sequence-flow highlighting.
- [src/instance-route-history.tsx](src/instance-route-history.tsx): Full history route (`#/history/process-instance/:id`) with breadcrumbs, BPMN viewer, audit log, variables, pagination, and filter box.
- [src/instance-tab-modify.tsx](src/instance-tab-modify.tsx): Process instance modification tab with sub-tabs for modifying process flow (start/cancel activities) and correlating messages. Includes a visual form builder for variables with type-specific inputs and comprehensive validation.
- [src/nologin.scss](src/nologin.scss): Shared stylesheet for all no-login plugins. Hides `form[name="signinForm"]` across all Operaton/Camunda webapps.
- [src/RobotModule/index.ts](src/RobotModule/index.ts): Additional BPMN module utilities for diagram rendering.
- [src/tasklist-audit-log.tsx](src/tasklist-audit-log.tsx): Tasklist detail tab that loads the instance audit log.
- [src/tasklist-custom-styles.tsx](src/tasklist-custom-styles.tsx): Minimal plugin that applies custom stylesheets (SCSS) for Tasklist UI customization.
- [src/tasklist-nologin.tsx](src/tasklist-nologin.tsx): Tasklist no-login plugin that hides the signin form with CSS. For environments with external authentication (SSO, reverse proxy).
- [src/welcome-custom-styles.tsx](src/welcome-custom-styles.tsx): Minimal plugin that applies custom stylesheets (SCSS) for Welcome UI customization.
- [src/welcome-nologin.tsx](src/welcome-nologin.tsx): Welcome no-login plugin that hides the signin form with CSS. For environments with external authentication (SSO, reverse proxy).

### Services (`src/services/`)
- [AuthorizationService.ts](src/services/AuthorizationService.ts): Authorization CRUD API abstraction used by the admin authorization route
- [ExternalTaskService.ts](src/services/ExternalTaskService.ts): External task API abstraction (query, retries, unlock) used by the integrations dashboard and unlock action
- [HistoryService.ts](src/services/HistoryService.ts): History API abstraction for testability with typed interfaces for historic activities and variables
- [ProcessInstanceService.ts](src/services/ProcessInstanceService.ts): Process instance API abstraction (query, modification, message/signal delivery)
- [ViewerService.ts](src/services/ViewerService.ts): BPMN viewer abstraction with interfaces for overlays, element registry, and canvas operations

### Shared utilities (`src/utils/`)
- [api.ts](src/utils/api.ts): API helpers and CSRF-aware fetch wrappers. `getActivityHistoryPage()` bounds the activity history the diagram is drawn from, asking for one record more than it keeps so it can report `truncated` without a second count request, and sorting oldest-first so a bounded response is a chronological prefix rather than an arbitrary subset. Everything that talks to the engine goes through these — they carry the CSRF header, normalise `api.engine`, raise `ApiError`, and route through the injectable fetch the tests replace. `get` also takes an abort signal, for callers that supersede their own requests
- [angular.ts](src/utils/angular.ts): Angular service abstraction for testability (route reloading)
- [authorization.ts](src/utils/authorization.ts): Authorization types, constants (AUTH_TYPES, RESOURCE_TYPES, PERMISSIONS_BY_RESOURCE), and helper functions for admin authorization management
- [bpmn.ts](src/utils/bpmn.ts): Re-exports from `bpmn/` submodule for backwards compatibility
- [bpmnParsing.ts](src/utils/bpmnParsing.ts): BPMN XML parsing for extracting activities, sequence flows, and message definitions
- [batchOperations.ts](src/utils/batchOperations.ts): Instance targeting helpers and the request builders behind the definition-level batch operations. Every dry run and every submit goes through these, so the previewed request is the sent request
- [constants.ts](src/utils/constants.ts): Centralized UI, timing, pagination, retry, and validation constants
- [datePickerWidget.tsx](src/utils/datePickerWidget.tsx) / [datePickerWidget.scss](src/utils/datePickerWidget.scss): Date picker widget used inside FilterBox tokens
- [filterExpressionParsers.ts](src/utils/filterExpressionParsers.ts): Pure functions for parsing FilterBox expressions to API query parameters. Provides `parseActivityInstanceExpressions()`, `parseProcessInstanceExpressions()`, `parseAuthorizationExpressions()` with typed interfaces for each query type.
- [filterSchema.ts](src/utils/filterSchema.ts): Schema-based filter configuration using react-select-filter-box. Provides `createDefinitionFilterSchema()`, `createInstanceQuerySchema()`, `createAuthorizationFilterSchema()`, and legacy expression converters for backward compatibility.
- [formatting.ts](src/utils/formatting.ts): Date formatting (`formatDateTime`, `formatDateForApi`) and URL building (`buildCockpitUrl`, `buildHistoryUrl`) utilities
- [misc.ts](src/utils/misc.ts): Local storage and querystring settings utilities
- [resizable-layout.scss](src/utils/resizable-layout.scss): Shared SCSS styles for Allotment-based resizable layouts (Resizer, Pane borders)
- [storage.ts](src/utils/storage.ts): Injectable storage abstraction with `MemoryStorage` for testing
- [variables.ts](src/utils/variables.ts): Variable transformation utilities (`transformVariables`, `transformVariableValue`) for API requests

### BPMN utilities (`src/utils/bpmn/`)
- [index.ts](src/utils/bpmn/index.ts): Module exports for BPMN utilities
- [connections.ts](src/utils/bpmn/connections.ts): Resolves which sequence flows an instance took, and how often. The engine never reports taken flows, so `getExecutedConnections()` infers them from activity timestamps: each candidate flow is scored once by pairing the source's completed executions with later target executions (`countTraversals()`), exclusive gateways are narrowed to the branch taken, and canceled activities are excluded on both ends. Also builds the dotted stubs that bridge the path through a node
- [overlays.ts](src/utils/bpmn/overlays.ts): Overlay rendering (activity count badges)
- [heatmap.ts](src/utils/bpmn/heatmap.ts): Time heatmap, shared by all three diagrams — the definition tab (cumulative across the filtered instances), a running instance, and an instance's history. `elapsedOf()` is the distinction that matters: `durationOf()` answers "how long did this take" and is 0 until an activity ends, which left the map blank for anything still running, so the heatmap measures an unfinished activity against the clock instead. The definition tab therefore also omits a `finished before` default filter — the engine reads that as "must have a finish time" and drops every running activity from the query
- [svg.ts](src/utils/bpmn/svg.ts): Draws the resolved path onto the diagram's `processInstance` layer as `svg-curves` curves, weighted by traversal count via `getStrokeWidth()` (logarithmic, capped by `EXECUTED_PATH_STROKE_WIDTH_MAX`) with the exact count in an SVG `<title>`. Each render gets its own arrow marker id, so two viewers on one page do not share one

### Custom hooks (`src/hooks/`)
- [useData.ts](src/hooks/useData.ts): Data fetching hooks (`useActivities`, `useVariables`, `useBpmnElements`, `useSettings`)
- [useFilterState.ts](src/hooks/useFilterState.ts): FilterBox expression state, query-parameter building, and URL/localStorage persistence
- [usePagination.ts](src/hooks/usePagination.ts): Page navigation state and `firstResult` calculation

### Reusable UI components (`src/Components/`)

**Layout and structure:**
- [APIContext.ts](src/Components/APIContext.ts): React context for API configuration
- [Container.tsx](src/Components/Container.tsx): Fixed view container wrapper
- [Page.tsx](src/Components/Page.tsx): Page wrapper with API context provider
- [Portal.tsx](src/Components/Portal.tsx): React portal for rendering into Cockpit DOM nodes
- [Tabs.tsx](src/Components/Tabs.tsx): Tab navigation component with active state management
- [DashboardSection.tsx](src/Components/DashboardSection.tsx): Collapsible dashboard section with title, loading/empty states, refresh button, and header actions
- [ErrorBoundary.tsx](src/Components/ErrorBoundary.tsx): React error boundary with fallback UI, keeping a crashing plugin from taking down the surrounding Cockpit view
- [HistoryViewLayout.tsx](src/Components/HistoryViewLayout.tsx): Resizable pane layout with BPMN viewer, info panel, and tabs (uses Allotment)
- [ProcessInfoPanel.tsx](src/Components/ProcessInfoPanel.tsx): Process instance metadata display with copy-to-clipboard

**Navigation:**
- [BreadcrumbsPanel.tsx](src/Components/BreadcrumbsPanel.tsx): Navigation breadcrumbs
- [Pagination.tsx](src/Components/Pagination.tsx): Pagination controls
- [PageLink.tsx](src/Components/PageLink.tsx): Individual page link component

**Data display:**
- [AuditLogTable.tsx](src/Components/AuditLogTable.tsx): Audit log table
- [HistoryTable.tsx](src/Components/HistoryTable.tsx): History records table

- [VariablesTable.tsx](src/Components/VariablesTable.tsx): Process variables table
- [SortableTable.tsx](src/Components/SortableTable.tsx): Generic sortable table wrapper with react-table and ARIA support
- [SortableAuthorizationsTable.tsx](src/Components/SortableAuthorizationsTable.tsx): Sortable authorization table with react-table for admin authorization management

**BPMN viewer:**
- [BPMN.tsx](src/Components/BPMN.tsx): BPMN viewer wrapper with zoom controls and history toggle buttons. Overlays, running tokens, the executed path and the heatmap are all redrawn by one effect keyed on `activities`, so auto-refresh moves them together; the two optional layers are held in refs (`sequenceFlowRef`, `heatmapRef`) and only redrawn when their toggle is on
- [ViewerButtonsPortal.tsx](src/Components/ViewerButtonsPortal.tsx): Testable abstraction for injecting buttons into BPMN viewer container via React portals
- [ResetZoomButton.tsx](src/Components/ResetZoomButton.tsx): Reset zoom control
- [ZoomInButton.tsx](src/Components/ZoomInButton.tsx): Zoom in control
- [ZoomOutButton.tsx](src/Components/ZoomOutButton.tsx): Zoom out control

**DMN viewer:**
- [DmnViewer.tsx](src/Components/DmnViewer.tsx): DMN viewer wrapper using dmn-js for rendering decision tables, DRD, and literal expressions
- [DecisionSelector.tsx](src/Components/DecisionSelector.tsx): Dropdown selector for choosing deployed decision definitions
- [DecisionInputForm.tsx](src/Components/DecisionInputForm.tsx): Dynamic input form for decision evaluation with type-specific inputs based on DMN schema
- [DecisionResults.tsx](src/Components/DecisionResults.tsx): Results display table showing evaluation outputs and matched rules

**Toggle buttons:**
- [ToggleAutoRefreshButton.tsx](src/Components/ToggleAutoRefreshButton.tsx): Auto-refresh toggle
- [ToggleHistoryStatisticsButton.tsx](src/Components/ToggleHistoryStatisticsButton.tsx): Three-state statistics toggle — off, execution counts, then time heatmap. Stored as the two booleans `showHistoricBadges` and `showHeatmap` so settings and URLs written before the heatmap existed keep their meaning
- [ToggleHistoryViewButton.tsx](src/Components/ToggleHistoryViewButton.tsx): History view toggle
- [ToggleHeatmapButton.tsx](src/Components/ToggleHeatmapButton.tsx): Time heatmap toggle for an instance's history diagram. Persists under `showInstanceHeatmap`, deliberately *not* the definition diagram's `showHeatmap` — that one also implies the count badges are on, so sharing it would make switching heat on here turn badges on over there. Goes amber and says so in its label when the history was truncated, since every total is then a floor and the element that looks hottest may just be the hottest one that survived the cut
- [ToggleSequenceFlowButton.tsx](src/Components/ToggleSequenceFlowButton.tsx): Sequence flow highlighting toggle

**Forms and inputs:**
- [FilterBox.tsx](src/Components/FilterBox.tsx): Token-based filter builder using react-select-filter-box with schema-based configuration, saved searches persistence, and legacy expression conversion
- [FilterBox.scss](src/Components/FilterBox.scss): Styles for FilterBox and saved searches dropdown

- [MessageCorrelationForm.tsx](src/Components/MessageCorrelationForm.tsx): Single-instance message correlation form with BPMN message parsing, variable configuration, and a business key field for message start events
- [RestartProcessForm.tsx](src/Components/RestartProcessForm.tsx): Restart form for externally/internally terminated instances, either picking one from a list or targeting the instance currently open in the history view
- [BatchModifyForm.tsx](src/Components/BatchModifyForm.tsx): Batch process modification form with instance selection, dry-run preview, and modification instructions
- [BatchMessageForm.tsx](src/Components/BatchMessageForm.tsx): Definition-level message form — correlates asynchronously to a selected set of instances (all, by activity/state query, or by explicit ids), or starts one new instance with a business key when the selected message sits on a start event
- [InstanceSelectionFields.tsx](src/Components/InstanceSelectionFields.tsx): Shared "select instances by" fields (all / query / specific ids) used by the batch modify and message forms
- [BatchSignalForm.tsx](src/Components/BatchSignalForm.tsx): Batch signal broadcast form for broadcasting signals globally
- [DryRunResultPreview.tsx](src/Components/DryRunResultPreview.tsx): Dry-run preview showing the affected process instances and the request the real run would send
- [IdentityAutocomplete.tsx](src/Components/IdentityAutocomplete.tsx): Autocomplete input for users/groups in authorization forms
- [ResourceAutocomplete.tsx](src/Components/ResourceAutocomplete.tsx): Autocomplete input for resource IDs in authorization forms
- [AuthorizationFormModal.tsx](src/Components/AuthorizationFormModal.tsx): Modal form for creating/editing authorizations with type, identity, permissions, and resource ID selection
- [AuthorizationDeleteModal.tsx](src/Components/AuthorizationDeleteModal.tsx): Confirmation modal for deleting authorization records
- [SelectField.tsx](src/Components/SelectField.tsx): Reusable form select field with consistent styling
- [FormButton.tsx](src/Components/FormButton.tsx): Reusable form button with variants (primary, secondary, danger, success)

- [ModifyFormOptions.tsx](src/Components/ModifyFormOptions.tsx): Modification form options (annotation, skip listeners/mappings)

**Feedback components:**
- [ErrorMessage.tsx](src/Components/ErrorMessage.tsx): Error alert with ARIA live region
- [SuccessMessage.tsx](src/Components/SuccessMessage.tsx): Success alert with ARIA support
- [LoadingSpinner.tsx](src/Components/LoadingSpinner.tsx): Loading indicator with ARIA busy state
- [WarningBox.tsx](src/Components/WarningBox.tsx): Warning box with customizable title

**Plugin wrapper components:**
- [InstanceDiagramAutoRefresh.tsx](src/Components/InstanceDiagramAutoRefresh.tsx): Auto-refresh button wrapper for instance diagram
- [InstanceDiagramHistoricActivities.tsx](src/Components/InstanceDiagramHistoricActivities.tsx): Historic activities overlays and sequence flow toggle
- [InstanceTabAuditLog.tsx](src/Components/InstanceTabAuditLog.tsx): Audit log tab for process instances
- [TasklistTabAuditLog.tsx](src/Components/TasklistTabAuditLog.tsx): Audit log tab for tasklist tasks
- [TaskListComponents.tsx](src/Components/TaskListComponents.tsx): Task item components for unlock dialog

## Abandoned plugins

### decisions-dashboard

**Status: abandoned. Do not extend it, and do not add it back to a default config.**

`decisions-dashboard` ([src/decisions-dashboard.tsx](src/decisions-dashboard.tsx), bundled to
`decisions-dashboard.js`) was an attempt to bring DMN evaluation directly into Cockpit: pick a deployed
decision definition, parse its DMN inputs into a form, evaluate it through the REST API, show the outputs,
and highlight matched rules on the rendered decision table.

It works, but the conclusion was that this simply does not belong in Cockpit. DMN authoring and evaluation
belong in the modelling tool, next to the DMN file being edited — and there is already a better version of
this idea in the **`datakurre.operaton-dmn-modeler` VS Code extension**. Cockpit is for operating running
processes, not for iterating on decision logic.

What that means concretely:

- It is **not** listed in [config.js](config.js) and **not** copied by the [Dockerfile](Dockerfile), so it
  does not ship. (Note that [README.md](README.md) still shows it in an older example `config.js` snippet;
  that snippet is out of date.)
- Sources, the committed bundle, its tests, and the DMN components it uses
  ([DmnViewer.tsx](src/Components/DmnViewer.tsx), [DecisionSelector.tsx](src/Components/DecisionSelector.tsx),
  [DecisionInputForm.tsx](src/Components/DecisionInputForm.tsx), [DecisionResults.tsx](src/Components/DecisionResults.tsx))
  are kept so the code stays buildable and the history stays readable — it is still an entry in
  [rollup.config.mjs](rollup.config.mjs) and still covered by
  [src/__tests__/decisions-dashboard.integration.test.tsx](src/__tests__/decisions-dashboard.integration.test.tsx).
- Keep it compiling and keep its tests green when you make repo-wide changes (dependency bumps, lint rules,
  shared component refactors). That is the whole maintenance contract.
- Do **not** spend effort on new features, UX work, or bug fixes here. If a user wants DMN evaluation, point
  them at `datakurre.operaton-dmn-modeler` instead.
- `dmn-js` remains a dependency only because of this plugin. If it is ever fully removed, that dependency and
  the four DMN components above go with it.

## Development

### Setup
```bash
npm install
npm run watch  # incremental bundles with sourcemaps
```

For a full stack, [devenv.nix](devenv.nix) provisions Operaton + PostgreSQL and a Caddy reverse proxy on
port 8000 that serves `*-config.js` and the bundles straight from the repository root, falling back to the
webapp's own assets. With `make up` (`devenv up`) running alongside `npm run watch`, a page refresh picks up
each rebuild.

### Scripts
- `npm run watch` – Development build with file watching and sourcemaps
- `npm run build` – Production bundle (sets `NODE_ENV=production`, no sourcemaps)
- `BUILD_PLUGIN=<name> npm run build` – Build only specific plugin(s) matching `<name>` (supports partial matching)
  - Example: `BUILD_PLUGIN=instance-historic-activities npm run build` – Build only instance-historic-activities.js
  - Example: `BUILD_PLUGIN=historic npm run build` – Build all plugins with "historic" in their name
  - Example: `BUILD_PLUGIN=nologin npm run build` – Build all nologin plugins
- `npm run lint` – Run ESLint on src/
- `npm run lint:fix` – Run ESLint with auto-fix
- `npm run typecheck` – Run TypeScript type checking
- `npm run prettier:check` – Check code formatting
- `npm run prettier:format` – Format code with Prettier
- `npm run check` – Run all static analysis (typecheck + lint + prettier)
- `npm run fix` – Auto-fix all fixable issues (lint + prettier)
- `make format` – Alias for Prettier formatting

### Static Analysis
The project uses strict static analysis optimized for LLM coding agent maintainability:

**ESLint** ([eslint.config.mjs](eslint.config.mjs)):
- TypeScript strict type checking (no implicit any, strict null checks)
- Complexity limits (max 100 lines/function, max 400 lines/file, max 15 cyclomatic complexity)
- Naming conventions (PascalCase for components/types, camelCase for functions, boolean prefixes)
- Required JSDoc on exported functions
- React hooks rules and accessibility checks
- Import organization and no circular dependencies
- No magic numbers (use named constants)

**TypeScript** ([tsconfig.json](tsconfig.json)):
- All strict mode options enabled
- `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` – Array access returns `T | undefined`
- `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` – Explicit undefined handling
- `noImplicitReturns` – All code paths must return

**Before committing**, run `npm run check` to validate all static analysis passes. It passes on `main`
as of `e95c20b`, so a failure is yours.

### Build notes
- Rollup compiles TypeScript + React with Babel
- SCSS is injected into the JavaScript bundles
- React/ReactDOM are aliased to ensure a single instance across the bundle (fixes hooks errors from nested dependencies)
- Built `*.js` files are committed for convenience; edit sources in `src/`, not the generated files

## Deployment

### Cockpit
- Plugins listed in `customScripts` inside [config.js](config.js) are loaded by Cockpit
- `bpmnJs.additionalModules` in [config.js](config.js) injects the BPMN behavior module
- Copy `config.js` and the relevant `*.js` files into the target webapp scripts directory

### Tasklist
- Plugins listed in [tasklist-config.js](tasklist-config.js) are loaded by Tasklist
- Copy `tasklist-config.js` (as `config.js`) plus `tasklist-audit-log.js` and `tasklist-custom-styles.js` into the scripts directory

### Admin and Welcome
- [admin-config.js](admin-config.js) loads `admin-route-authorization.js` and `admin-custom-styles.js`
- [welcome-config.js](welcome-config.js) loads `welcome-custom-styles.js`
- Each is copied into the corresponding webapp's scripts directory as `config.js`

### Docker
- The [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) fetches this repository at `PLUGINS_REF`, lays the bundles and the four
  configs into an overlay, and `zip -u`s them into Operaton's `operaton-webapp-webjar-*.jar` /
  `operaton-webapp-*.war`. When you add or remove a shipped plugin, update **both** the relevant `*config.js`
  **and** the Dockerfile's `cp` list, or the image and the config will disagree.

### Requirements
- Plugins expect Operaton/Camunda REST endpoints available via `api.engineApi` and related fields passed by Cockpit
- History endpoints (`/history/*`) must be reachable and may return up to 1000 records unless overridden

See [README.md](README.md) for detailed deployment instructions including Spring Boot setup.

## Behavioral notes
- History overlays and sequence-flow coloring rely on completed activities; gateways use a deny-list to avoid highlighting inactive branches.
- User preferences (auto-refresh, badges, pane sizes, sequence-flow toggle) persist in `localStorage` under `minimal-history-plugin` and can also be influenced via URL query hash parameters.
- Filtering UIs build REST queries; date filters use `startedAfter`/`finishedBefore` in UTC with millisecond precision.
- Favourited definitions live in `localStorage` under `minimal-history-plugin-favourites` and are written by `dashboard-favourites` but also *read* by `dashboard-integrations` (favourites-only filter, on by default). Changing that key breaks both plugins.

## Extending safely
- Follow the existing plugin export shape (array of `pluginPoint` definitions) and keep DOM side effects contained; several plugins reuse portals to ensure long-lived nodes.
- Reuse helpers: fetch data with [src/utils/api.ts](src/utils/api.ts) to inherit CSRF handling and history pagination limits; render BPMN overlays through [src/utils/bpmn.ts](src/utils/bpmn.ts) when adding diagram visuals.
- Keep UI pieces inside [src/Components/](src/Components/) to share styles and behavior; SCSS may be colocated and will be inlined by Rollup.
- Adding a new shipped plugin means four places, not one: `src/`, [rollup.config.mjs](rollup.config.mjs), the relevant `*config.js`, and the [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) `cp` list.
- Anything that mutates engine state at scale is subject to [Dangerous operations and dry runs](#dangerous-operations-and-dry-runs) — dry run, visible payload, and a `WarningBox` scoped honestly.

### Portal usage patterns

Cockpit plugins receive DOM nodes via render callbacks. Two patterns are used to integrate React:

**1. Direct rendering** (simple plugins):
```tsx
// For plugins that only need one entry point
render: (node: Element, { api }) => {
  createRoot(node).render(<MyComponent api={api} />);
}
```
Used in: `definition-tab-modify.tsx`, `instance-tab-modify.tsx`, `tasklist-audit-log.tsx`, `instance-action-unlock.tsx`

**2. Hooks pattern with Portal** (multi-entry plugins):
```tsx
// For plugins that share state across multiple pluginPoints (e.g., diagram + tab)
const initialState: Record<string, any> = { viewer: null };
const hooks: Record<string, any> = {
  setViewer: (v) => (initialState['viewer'] = v),
};

const Plugin: React.FC = ({ root }) => {
  const [viewer, setViewer] = useState(initialState['viewer']);
  hooks['setViewer'] = setViewer; // Bridge external callback to React state
  return viewer ? <Portal node={root}><Content /></Portal> : null;
};

export default [
  { pluginPoint: 'diagram.plugin', render: (v) => hooks['setViewer'](v) },
  { pluginPoint: 'runtime.action', render: (node, api) => createRoot(node).render(<Plugin root={node} api={api} />) },
];
```
Used in: `definition-historic-activities.tsx`, `instance-route-history.tsx`

**3. ViewerButtonsPortal** (BPMN viewer buttons):
```tsx
// Clean abstraction for injecting buttons into BPMN viewer
<ViewerButtonsPortal viewer={viewer} position={{ right: '15px', top: '15px' }}>
  <ToggleButton onToggle={handleToggle} />
</ViewerButtonsPortal>
```
Used in: `instance-historic-activities.tsx` via `InstanceDiagramHistoricActivities`, and `Components/BPMN.tsx`

## Dangerous operations and dry runs

Several plugins fire operations that can affect thousands of running process instances at once and cannot be
undone: batch modification, asynchronous message correlation, engine-wide signal broadcast, external task
retry/unlock, process restart, and authorization changes. Treat every one of these as a destructive action.

The rule for anything with such a blast radius:

1. **It must have a dry run.** The user gets to look before they leap.
2. **The dry run must show the request the real run would send** — HTTP method, endpoint, and the full JSON
   body, exactly as it would be serialized — in addition to the affected instances. Showing only a count and a
   sample of instance IDs is not enough: the payload is where the real damage is decided (which instructions,
   which variables and their types, `skipCustomListeners` / `skipIoMappings`, whether the target is
   `processInstanceIds` or an open-ended `processInstanceQuery`). A user cannot sanity-check an operation they
   cannot see.
3. **It must carry a `WarningBox`** stating the scope in plain words, especially when the scope is wider than
   the view the user is standing in (e.g. `BatchSignalForm` broadcasts engine-wide, not just to this
   definition).

Current state, and the gap to close:

| Form | Dry run | Shows affected instances | Shows the request |
|------|---------|--------------------------|-------------------|
| [BatchModifyForm.tsx](src/Components/BatchModifyForm.tsx) (`POST /modification/executeAsync`) | "Dry Run" | yes | yes |
| [BatchMessageForm.tsx](src/Components/BatchMessageForm.tsx) (`POST /process-instance/message-async`, `POST /message`) | "Dry Run" | yes, for correlation; a start message creates an instance and has none | yes, both paths |
| [BatchSignalForm.tsx](src/Components/BatchSignalForm.tsx) (`POST /signal`) | "Dry Run" | this definition's instances only, with a note that the broadcast is engine-wide | yes |

The per-instance actions — external task retry/unlock ([instance-action-unlock.tsx](src/instance-action-unlock.tsx),
[dashboard-integrations.tsx](src/dashboard-integrations.tsx)) and restart
([RestartProcessForm.tsx](src/Components/RestartProcessForm.tsx)) — act on an explicit selection the user can
see in a table, which satisfies rule 1 for them. They still send a body worth showing, so if you touch them,
surface it too.

This is wired so it cannot drift. [src/utils/batchOperations.ts](src/utils/batchOperations.ts) holds the pure
targeting helpers and one request builder per operation, each returning a `BatchRequest`
(`{ method, path, payload }`). The dry run renders that value through
[DryRunResultPreview.tsx](src/Components/DryRunResultPreview.tsx) and the submit handler posts the same
value — there is no second "what we would send" serializer to fall out of step. When you add an operation,
follow the same shape: builder in `batchOperations.ts`, unit tests beside it in
[src/utils/__tests__/batchOperations.test.ts](src/utils/__tests__/batchOperations.test.ts), and never
construct a payload inline in a form.

## Testing

The project uses Jest with React Testing Library for unit and integration tests. Run tests with:
```bash
npm run test          # Run all tests
npm run test:watch    # Run in watch mode
npm run test:coverage # Generate coverage report
npm run test:ci       # Run in CI mode with coverage
```

Coverage moves with every change, so this document does not pin exact numbers — run `npm run test:coverage`
for the current figures. The enforced floor lives in [jest.config.js](jest.config.js) (see
[Coverage thresholds](#coverage-thresholds)); keep changes at or above it.

### Test organization
- `src/__tests__/` – Integration tests for plugins and API
- `src/Components/__tests__/` – Component unit tests
- `src/services/__tests__/` – Service layer tests
- `src/utils/__tests__/` – Utility function tests
- `src/__fixtures__/` – Test fixtures (activities, variables, BPMN XML, API responses)
- `src/__mocks__/` – Module mocks for external dependencies

### Coverage thresholds
Coverage thresholds are enforced in [jest.config.js](jest.config.js):
- Global: 35% branches, 55% functions/lines/statements
- `src/utils/`: 55% branches, 75% functions/lines/statements

**Note:** End-to-end testing is intentionally skipped. The plugins integrate with Operaton/Camunda Cockpit's Angular-based runtime environment, making browser automation setup complex. The unit and integration tests provide sufficient coverage for the React components and API interactions.

## Known issues and fixes

- **`bpmn-moddle` imports must stay named — do not "fix" them to default imports.** This broke the
  repository once (typecheck exit 2, no bundle could be built, 26 tests failing across 6 suites, CI red
  at the typecheck step so the `Build` job never ran); fixed in `e95c20b`. `@types/bpmn-moddle@10` and
  the package's own ESM build both expose **named** exports and no default:

  ```
  dist/index.js: export { SimpleBpmnModdle as BpmnModdle }
  index.d.ts:    export const BpmnModdle: BPMNModdleConstructor
  ```

  So [src/RobotModule/renderer.ts](src/RobotModule/renderer.ts) and
  [src/utils/bpmn/connections.ts](src/utils/bpmn/connections.ts) use `import type * as BPMNModdle` for
  namespace-style type access, and [src/utils/bpmnParsing.ts](src/utils/bpmnParsing.ts) uses
  `import { BpmnModdle }` for the constructor. A default import is TS2613 and fails `tsc` *and* the
  rollup typescript plugin, which is what makes it fatal rather than cosmetic.

  The matching Jest setup is load-bearing too. There is deliberately **no** `^bpmn-moddle$` module
  mapping: the CJS build is `module.exports = SimpleBpmnModdle`, which a named import cannot read, and
  it requires the ESM-only `moddle` and `moddle-xml` anyway. Jest loads the same ESM entry rollup does,
  which is why `transformIgnorePatterns` in [jest.config.js](jest.config.js) allowlists the whole chain
  (`bpmn-moddle`, `moddle`, `moddle-xml`, `saxen`, `min-dash`). That pattern is unanchored, so a nested
  path such as `bpmn-moddle/node_modules/min-dash` is only transformed when *every* `node_modules/` segment
  in it is followed by an allowlisted name. Drop `bpmn-moddle` from that list and the nested copy silently
  stops being transformed again.

- **`BatchSignalForm`'s instance preview cannot show the full blast radius.** `POST /signal` reaches every
  matching signal catch event in every deployed definition, but the engine offers no way to query that
  set, so the preview lists instances of the current definition and says in a note that the real reach is
  wider. This is a limit of the API, not a bug to fix.

- **The build targets ES5, so `class extends Error` needs a prototype fix.** `tsconfig.json` sets
  `"target": "es5"`, whose downlevel of `extends Error` drops the prototype link, silently making every
  `err instanceof ApiError` false — in the shipped bundles, not only in tests. Seven call sites depended
  on it, including the 404 check in [src/admin-route-authorization.tsx](src/admin-route-authorization.tsx)
  that decides whether a resource is reported missing or merely unverifiable. `ApiError`'s constructor now
  calls `Object.setPrototypeOf(this, ApiError.prototype)`, covered by a test in
  [src/utils/__tests__/api.test.ts](src/utils/__tests__/api.test.ts). Any future class extending a builtin
  (`Error`, `Array`, `Map`) needs the same line until the target is raised.

- **react-select-filter-box installed from git**: The package has no npm releases and is pinned to a commit
  of `github:jyukopla/react-select-filter-box` in [package.json](package.json). Bumping it means moving the
  commit hash, and there is no changelog to consult.

- **TypeScript warnings with react-select-filter-box**: The package bundles its own `@types/react` which conflicts with the project's React types. [src/Components/FilterBox.tsx](src/Components/FilterBox.tsx) casts the component to a local type to bypass this incompatibility. Jest sidesteps it entirely with a mock at [src/__mocks__/react-select-filter-box.tsx](src/__mocks__/react-select-filter-box.tsx).
