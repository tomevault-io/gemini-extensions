# AGENTS.md

This file is the project entry point for general AI agents.

**You MUST read [`skills/ppt-master/SKILL.md`](skills/ppt-master/SKILL.md) before any PPT generation task or repo modification.** This repository exists to generate presentations; SKILL.md is the authoritative workflow that owns project creation, role switching, serial execution, quality gates, post-processing, export, and every per-step command. The rest of this file only points to where related material lives — it never substitutes for SKILL.md.

## Project Overview

PPT Master is an AI-driven presentation generation system. Multi-role collaboration (Strategist → Image_Generator → Executor) converts source documents (PDF/DOCX/URL/Markdown) into natively editable PPTX with real PowerPoint shapes (DrawingML).

**Core Pipeline**: `Source Document → Create Project → [Template] → Strategist Eight Confirmations → [Image_Generator] → Executor Live Preview → Quality Check → Post-processing → Export PPTX`

> Topic-only requests with no source material: run the standalone [`topic-research`](skills/ppt-master/workflows/topic-research.md) workflow before SKILL.md Step 1 to gather web materials.
>
> Phase B resumption (split-mode execution): when the user opens a fresh chat and says "继续生成 projects/<x>" or similar, run the standalone [`resume-execute`](skills/ppt-master/workflows/resume-execute.md) workflow to enter Phase B (SVG generation + export) without re-running Phase A.
>
> Decks containing data charts: run the standalone [`verify-charts`](skills/ppt-master/workflows/verify-charts.md) workflow between the executor and post-processing steps to calibrate chart coordinates.
>
> Recorded narration / video export: run the standalone [`generate-audio`](skills/ppt-master/workflows/generate-audio.md) workflow after post-processing.
>
> Object-level animation tuning: when the user asks to change animation order, effect, timing, or a specific object's reveal behavior, run the standalone [`customize-animations`](skills/ppt-master/workflows/customize-animations.md) workflow. Default export has no page transitions; do not create `animations.json` unless customization was requested.
>
> Live preview: any time the user mentions "live preview", "preview", "看效果", or wants to click/select a slide element, run [`live-preview`](skills/ppt-master/workflows/live-preview.md). Step 6 auto-starts it during generation; the workflow covers post-export re-entry and applying submitted annotations.
>
> Brand identity setup: when the user asks to "set up brand" / "建立品牌" / "做品牌规范", provides a brand asset (logo / brand site URL / branded PPTX / brand PDF), or wants to extract a brand from existing materials, run the standalone [`create-brand`](skills/ppt-master/workflows/create-brand.md) workflow. Output goes to `skills/ppt-master/templates/brands/<id>/`. Brands apply at SKILL.md Step 3 via the same explicit-path rule as layout templates — the user supplies the brand directory path to apply it; bare brand names never trigger.
>
> Visual self-check: only when the user explicitly requests a per-page visual review on the generated SVGs (e.g., "跑一下视觉自检 / 视觉回看 / 视觉 rubric", "visual review", "check each page visually"), run the standalone [`visual-review`](skills/ppt-master/workflows/visual-review.md) workflow between the executor and post-processing steps. The main pipeline does NOT invoke it automatically; do not infer or recommend it from deck size, model identity, or any other signal — user request is the only trigger.

## Execution Requirements

- For standalone template creation (no source deck), read [`skills/ppt-master/workflows/create-template.md`](skills/ppt-master/workflows/create-template.md).
- Technical SVG/PPT constraints live in [`skills/ppt-master/references/shared-standards.md`](skills/ppt-master/references/shared-standards.md).
- Canvas choices live in [`skills/ppt-master/references/canvas-formats.md`](skills/ppt-master/references/canvas-formats.md).
- Icon library details live in [`skills/ppt-master/templates/icons/README.md`](skills/ppt-master/templates/icons/README.md).

## Required Conventions

- **Repo-wide style rules** — when editing prompt files under [`skills/ppt-master/references/`](skills/ppt-master/references/), Python under [`skills/ppt-master/scripts/`](skills/ppt-master/scripts/), or any other code/prose in the repo, follow the matching style rule in [`docs/rules/`](docs/rules/).
- **Markdown language consistency** — Markdown files under `skills/ppt-master/workflows/`, `skills/ppt-master/references/`, and `docs/` are currently single-language per directory. New files mirror the language of their siblings; do not mix English scaffolding with Chinese paragraphs (or vice versa) inside one file. Chat replies are unaffected.

## Compatibility Boundary

- This repository is a workflow/skill package, not an app or service scaffold.
- Do NOT assume generic-project conventions like `.worktrees/`, `tests/`, or mandatory branch setup unless the user explicitly requests them.
- On conflict with a generic coding skill, prioritize [`skills/ppt-master/SKILL.md`](skills/ppt-master/SKILL.md) inside this repository.

## Command Quick Reference

Convenience summary only — full workflow in [`skills/ppt-master/SKILL.md`](skills/ppt-master/SKILL.md).

> **Python command**: All examples below use `python3` as a placeholder. On Windows, `python3` may point to a Microsoft Store stub (exit code 49). **Detect the working command first** by trying `python3 --version`, `python --version`, `py -3 --version` in order — use whichever succeeds. `preflight_check.py` auto-detects and prints `PYTHON_CMD=<cmd>`. Use that value for the entire session.

```bash
# Python detection (run FIRST in every session)
# Try: python3 --version / python --version / py -3 --version
# Use the first one that works as ${PYTHON} below.
# preflight_check.py also prints PYTHON_CMD=<cmd> for you.
