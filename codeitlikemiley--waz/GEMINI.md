## 1. Repository Overview

Warp is a Rust-centric **agentic terminal / development environment**: built on a custom UI framework (WarpUI), it integrates terminal emulation, AI agents, cloud sync (Drive), code review, completion, Notebook, settings, IPC, and other capabilities.

Top-level directories:

| Directory | Purpose |
|------|------|
| `app/` | Main binary crate (`warp`), assembling all subsystems, UI, database migrations, and platform glue layer |
| `crates/` | 67 workspace members, library crates split by responsibility |
| `command-signatures-v2/` | Independent subproject (excluded when running nextest with `--exclude`) |
| `script/` | Cross-platform bootstrap, build, and presubmit scripts |
| `resources/` | Fonts, icons, shell integration scripts, shaders, and other runtime resources |
| `docker/` | Containerized build configurations |
| `specs/` | Product/Technical spec documents |
| `.agents/skills`, `.claude/skills` | Skill descriptions for agent workflows (PR creation, error fixing, feature gating/rollout, etc.) |
| `.warp/`, `.config/`, `.cargo/`, `.vscode/` | Configurations for various tools |

Build System: Cargo workspace, `resolver = "2"`. `default-members` is intentionally restricted to the subset that is frequently compiled/tested (see `Cargo.toml`). `serve-wasm` and `integration` are excluded from `default-members` by default.

License Split:
- `crates/warpui` and `crates/warpui_core` → MIT
- Others → AGPL-3.0-only

## 2. Top-Level Architectural Layers

There are roughly 4 layers from bottom to top. When adding new code or locating a bug, first determine which layer the change belongs to, and **never introduce circular or downward-pointing dependencies across layers**.

```
app/  (Main binary: assembly, entry points, platform glue, persistence migrations, UI view root)
  ↑
Product domain crates: ai / computer_use / vim / onboarding /
                      warp_completer / lsp / languages / code-review …
  ↑
Framework crates: warpui / warpui_core / warpui_extras / editor /
            ui_components / sum_tree / syntax_tree
  ↑
Infrastructure crates: warp_core / warp_util / http_client /
                websocket / ipc / jsonrpc / persistence / graphql /
                managed_secrets / virtual_fs / watcher / asset_cache …
```

Key Architectural Patterns (see `WARP.md` for details):

1. **Entity-Handle System**: `App` globally owns all view/model entities. Views reference each other via `ViewHandle<T>` rather than direct ownership.
2. **Element / Action**: The UI is composed of a declarative Element tree + Action event system (Flutter-style).
3. **Cross-Platform**: Native implementation for macOS / Windows / Linux + WASM target. Platform-specific code is isolated using `#[cfg(...)]`.
4. **AI Integration**: Agent Mode and context index. Code is concentrated in `app/src/ai` (389 files) and `crates/ai`.
5. **Cloud Sync**: `Drive` enables object synchronization across multiple devices. See `app/src/drive` and `crates/warp_files`.
6. **Feature Flag**: Runtime rollout/gating takes precedence over `#[cfg]`. The enum is defined in `crates/warp_core/src/features.rs`.

## 3. `crates/` Overview

The table below lists all 67 crates grouped by topic. Each row contains only a **one-sentence description of its responsibility**; to view implementation details, open `crates/<name>/src/lib.rs` directly (many crates have `//!` module documentation at the top of `lib.rs`).

## 5. Engineering Discipline (Hard Constraints for Agents)

> These are compiled based on `WARP.md` and custom project rules; validation requirements for agents in this document are subject to `cargo check`.

### 5.1 Required Reading Conventions
- **Comments and replies must be in English** (User Rule).
- Use the `fff` tool or `rg -n "<keyword>" <path>` for searching/grepping within the git index; `read_file` is strictly for images/binary files.
- Before submitting a PR / pushing a new commit, you **only** need to pass: `cargo check`.
- Changes must be precise: **every line of modification must be traceable to a user request**. Do not casually "improve" unrelated code, comments, or formatting.
- Simplicity first: do not introduce abstractions, configurations, error handling, or redundant features for single-point usage.
- Explain alternative options and expose uncertainties, rather than making choices for the user silently.
- worktree path: .worktrees/<worktree_name>/

### 5.2 Rust Style (Excerpted from `WARP.md`)
- Do not write redundant type annotations for closure parameters.
- Unify `use` statements at the top; do not write long fully-qualified paths, except within `#[cfg]` branches.
- Context parameters must be named `ctx` and placed last; if there is also a closure parameter, place the closure last.
- Unused parameters must be **deleted directly** rather than prefixed with `_`. Update caller sites accordingly.
- Use inline format arguments in macros like `println!` / `format!` (`"{x}"` instead of `"{}", x`) to satisfy the `uninlined_format_args` lint.
- `match` statements **must not use the `_` wildcard** (unless absolutely necessary); maintain exhaustive matching.
- Do not delete or modify existing comments due to unrelated modifications.

### 5.3 Terminal Model Lock (High Priority!)
- Calling `TerminalModel::lock()` is highly prone to deadlocks (which manifests as UI freezing / beachballing on macOS).
- Before adding `model.lock()`, you must verify that no upper level in the call stack already holds the lock. Try to pass the locked reference down the call stack instead of re-locking.
- Minimize the lock scope, and do not call functions that might re-acquire the lock while holding it.

### 5.4 Feature Flag
- Add: add a variant to the `FeatureFlag` enum in `crates/warp_core/src/features.rs`; add it to `DOGFOOD_FLAGS` / `PREVIEW_FLAGS` / `RELEASE_FLAGS` as needed.
- Usage: **Prefer** runtime checks using `FeatureFlag::Xxx.is_enabled()` over `#[cfg(...)]`; use `cfg` only when it cannot compile without it (due to platform or optional dependencies).
- Wrap the entire product feature section rather than adding it to every single invocation point; **clean up flags and dead branches** after stabilization.
- The UI entry point and the code path must be controlled by the same flag.

### 5.5 Database
- ORM: Diesel + SQLite.
- Adding or modifying schemas must go through migrations: add a new directory under `migrations/` (`up.sql` / `down.sql`). Do not manually edit `app/src/persistence/schema.rs` (which is generated by `diesel print-schema`).

### 5.6 Testing
- Use `cargo nextest run --no-fail-fast --workspace --exclude command-signatures-v2`.
- Place unit tests in `${filename}_tests.rs` or `mod_test.rs`. At the end of the original file, use:

  ```rust
  #[cfg(test)]
  #[path = "filename_tests.rs"]
  mod tests;
  ```

- For integration tests, use the framework in `crates/integration`; examples are located in `app/src/integration_testing/`.

### 5.7 Cross-Process Commands
- Do not directly use `std::process::Command::new(...)` (which popups a window especially on Windows); unify process spawning via `crates/command`.

### 5.8 Sub-agents / Multi-agents
- Split large tasks into parallel sub-tasks with **non-overlapping write scopes**; information gathering tasks can also run in parallel.
- Execute simple tasks directly without over-splitting.

## 7. Pre-modification Checklist

Before modifying the code, ask yourself once:

1. Which layer / crate / `app/src/<submodule>` does this change belong to? Will the modifications cross layer boundaries?
2. Do you need to add dependencies? If existing workspace dependencies can be reused, prioritize reusing them in `Cargo.toml` under `[workspace.dependencies]`.
3. Is this a product feature? Does it need to be wrapped in a Feature Flag?
4. Does it involve the terminal model? Does the current call stack already hold the `TerminalModel` lock?
5. Does it involve child processes? Does it use `crates/command`?
6. Does it involve persistence? Is a database migration required?
7. Have you written the corresponding `${file}_tests.rs`?
8. Is `cargo check` green?
9. Can every line of your modifications be mapped directly to the user request? Should any casual "micro-refactoring" be rolled back?

Go through all 9 items above before delivering/submitting.
