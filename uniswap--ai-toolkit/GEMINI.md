# CLAUDE.md - AI Toolkit Project Guidelines

## Core Requirements

### Nx Usage

- **REQUIREMENT**: Use Nx for ALL packages and tooling in this monorepo
- Every package must be an Nx project with proper configuration
- Use Nx generators, executors, and workspace features wherever possible
- Leverage Nx's dependency graph and caching capabilities

#### Nx Generator Schema Configuration - Critical Rules

When creating Nx generators with conditional prompting (showing/hiding prompts based on other values), follow these rules:

**CRITICAL: Avoid `x-prompt` for conditional fields**

The `x-prompt` property can interfere with conditional prompting logic. For fields that should only appear conditionally:

1. ❌ **DO NOT** use `x-prompt` (even nested as `x-prompt.when`) IF the variable is not ALWAYS something we want to know from the User (i.e. it's NOT CONDITIONAL)
2. ❌ **DO NOT** include a `default` value if the field should be optional
3. ✅ **DO** use only `prompt-when` at the property level
4. ✅ **DO** rely on the prompt-utils to generate prompts from property metadata

**Example - Conditional Prompt Implementation:**

```json
{
  "properties": {
    "installMode": {
      "type": "string",
      "enum": ["all", "specific"],
      "default": "all",
      "x-prompt": {
        "message": "What would you like to install?",
        "type": "list",
        "items": [...]
      }
    },
    "addon": {
      "type": "string",
      "enum": ["option1", "option2", "option3"],
      // ❌ NO x-prompt here - it would always trigger
      // ❌ NO default value - would prevent prompt from showing when needed
      "prompt-when": "installMode === 'specific'"  // ✅ ONLY this
    }
  }
}
```

**Why this matters:**

- `x-prompt` presence can cause prompts to appear regardless of conditions
- `default` values can interfere with the `shouldPrompt` logic in prompt-utils
- The prompt-utils checks for `prompt-when` AFTER checking if prompting is needed
- Only properties without `x-prompt` and without defaults will properly respect `prompt-when`

**Reference:** See packages/ai-toolkit-nx-claude/src/generators/addons/schema.json for a working example of conditional prompting with `installMode` controlling `addon` visibility.

### Package Structure

- All packages must be properly configured Nx libraries or applications
- Use Nx's project.json for configuration
- Follow Nx best practices for monorepo organization

### Development Workflow

- Use Nx commands for all operations (build, test, lint, etc.)
- Maintain proper inter-package dependencies through Nx
- Ensure all packages are part of the Nx workspace graph

### Code Quality Enforcement

After making any code changes, Claude Code MUST:

1. **Format the code**: Run `bunx nx format:write --uncommitted` to format all uncommitted files using Prettier configuration

   - For CI or when comparing against a specific base: `bunx nx format:write --affected --base=HEAD~1`
   - This ensures consistent code style across the entire codebase

2. **Lint the code**: Run `bunx nx affected --target=lint --base=HEAD~1` to check for linting errors

   - This runs ESLint on all affected projects based on your changes
   - If there are linting errors that can be auto-fixed, add the `--fix` flag: `bunx nx affected --target=lint --base=HEAD~1 --fix`

3. **Typecheck the code**: Run `bunx nx affected --target=typecheck --base=HEAD~1` to typecheck all affected projects.

4. **Lint markdown files**: After creating or updating any markdown files (.md), run `bunx markdownlint-cli2 --fix "**/*.md"` to ensure all markdown files follow the project's markdown standards.

   - This uses the `.markdownlint-cli2.jsonc` configuration file at the repository root
   - The linting will automatically fix most common formatting issues
   - This check MUST pass (exit code 0) before proceeding
   - The markdown linter also runs automatically as a pre-commit hook via Lefthook

5. **Why use these commands**:
   - `--uncommitted` flag formats only files that haven't been committed yet
   - `--affected` with `--base=HEAD~1` identifies all projects affected by changes since the last commit
   - Using Nx's affected commands ensures only relevant code is checked, making the process fast and efficient
   - These commands leverage Nx's dependency graph to include downstream projects that might be affected

## Project Context

This is the AI Toolkit monorepo that provides standardized Claude Code plugins via the Claude Code Marketplace. The project uses:

- Nx for monorepo management
- TypeScript with strict settings
- Bun as the package manager (npm retained only for OIDC trusted publishing in CI)
- ESLint and Prettier for code quality

### Bun Package Manager

**This project uses Bun as its package manager.**

**Installation:**

```bash
# Install Bun (if not already installed)
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

**Key commands:**

```bash
bun install              # Install dependencies
bun install --frozen-lockfile  # CI-safe install (fails if bun.lock is out of date)
bunx nx <command>        # Run Nx commands
```

**Supply chain security:** The project enforces a 3-day minimum release age for new package versions via `bunfig.toml`. Versions published less than 3 days ago are filtered out during installation.

**npm for publishing only:** The CI publish pipeline (`publish-packages.yml`) installs npm 11.7.0+ via `npm install -g npm@$NPM_VERSION` so that `npx nx release publish` can perform OIDC trusted publishing. npm OIDC requires npm >= 11.5.1, and the `workflow_ref` claim in the OIDC token must match the configured trusted workflow. The `.npmrc` file (registry config only) and the npm CLI are retained in the publish job for this purpose. Dependency installation in the publish job — and everywhere else — uses `bun install --frozen-lockfile`.

## Package Scope

All packages use the `@ai-toolkit` scope.

## Repository Structure

### Plugin Architecture

The repository uses a plugin-based architecture where Claude Code capabilities are organized into dedicated plugin packages:

```text
/
├── .claude-plugin/
│   └── marketplace.json              # Plugin marketplace configuration
├── packages/
│   └── plugins/
│       ├── claude-setup/             # Repository setup wizard
│       ├── development-codebase-tools/  # Code exploration & refactoring
│       ├── development-planning/     # Implementation planning & execution workflows
│       ├── development-pr-workflow/  # PR management, review, & Graphite integration
│       ├── development-productivity/ # Documentation, research, & prompt optimization
│       ├── spec-workflow/            # Spec-driven development workflows
│       └── uniswap-integrations/    # External service integrations (Linear, Notion, Nx)
└── scripts/
    └── validate-plugin.cjs           # Plugin structure validation script
```

**Key Points:**

- Plugins are stored in `./packages/plugins/<plugin-name>/`
- Each plugin is a self-contained Nx package with its own `package.json`, `project.json`, and `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
- The `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` file references plugins via relative paths: `"./packages/plugins/<plugin-name>"`
- There are 7 plugins: claude-setup, development-codebase-tools, development-planning, development-pr-workflow, development-productivity, spec-workflow, uniswap-integrations

**Plugin Validation:**

Use the validation script to check plugin structure:

```bash
node scripts/validate-plugin.cjs packages/plugins/<plugin-name>
```

### Plugin Versioning

All plugins follow semantic versioning (semver). Key versioning rules:

- **All plugins MUST be versioned at 1.0.0 or higher** for production releases
- Version is specified in each plugin's `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` file
- When making changes to plugins, update the version appropriately:
  - **Patch (1.0.X)**: Bug fixes, minor documentation updates, typo fixes
  - **Minor (1.X.0)**: New skills, agents, or commands (backward compatible)
  - **Major (X.0.0)**: Breaking changes, significant restructuring, removed components

#### Mandatory Version Bumping

**CRITICAL: After making any changes to files in `packages/plugins/`, Claude Code MUST bump the plugin version.**

1. **Identify the affected plugin(s)**: Determine which plugin(s) were modified based on the file paths changed.

2. **Determine the appropriate version bump** using semver:

   - **Patch bump** (e.g., 1.0.0 → 1.0.1): Bug fixes, documentation updates, typo corrections, internal refactoring with no user-facing changes
   - **Minor bump** (e.g., 1.0.1 → 1.1.0): New skills, agents, commands, or MCP servers added; new features; backward-compatible enhancements
   - **Major bump** (e.g., 1.1.0 → 2.0.0): Breaking changes, removed components, renamed skills/agents/commands, significant restructuring

3. **Update the version** in the plugin's `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` file:

   ```json
   {
     "name": "plugin-name",
     "version": "1.0.1",  // ← Update this field
     ...
   }
   ```

4. **Include the version bump in the same commit** as the plugin changes - do not create a separate commit for version updates.

**Example workflow:**

```text
1. Make changes to packages/plugins/development-pr-workflow/skills/review-code/
2. Determine change type: Added new prompt template → Minor change
3. Update packages/plugins/development-pr-workflow/.claude-plugin/plugin.json
   - Change "version": "1.0.0" to "version": "1.1.0"
4. Commit all changes together
```

**Current plugins:**

| Plugin                     | Version |
| -------------------------- | ------- |
| claude-setup               | 1.0.4   |
| development-codebase-tools | 2.6.0   |
| development-planning       | 2.0.1   |
| development-pr-workflow    | 2.1.0   |
| development-productivity   | 2.4.0   |
| spec-workflow              | 2.0.1   |
| uniswap-integrations       | 2.4.0   |

**Note:** Keep this table updated when versions change.

### Adding New Skills and Commands to Plugins

When making changes to `packages/plugins/`, follow these guidelines:

#### A. Adding User-Invocable Skills

Skills are automatically discoverable by Claude Code when placed in the `skills` array in `plugin.json`. Each skill directory contains a `SKILL.md` file with the skill content.

**Steps:**

1. Create a skill directory: `skills/<skill-name>/`
2. Create the skill file as `SKILL.md` inside that directory
3. Add to the `skills` array in `plugin.json`: `"./skills/<skill-name>"`
4. Do NOT add skills to the `commands` array — that is only for standalone commands in `./commands/`

**Example structure:**

```text
skills/sre/
└── SKILL.md           # skill content with YAML frontmatter
```

**plugin.json configuration:**

```json
{
  "skills": ["./skills/sre"]
}
```

#### B. Adding New Slash Commands

Standalone commands (not skills) go in the `./commands/` directory:

1. Create the command as a `.md` file in `./commands/`
2. **Do NOT add a `name` field** in the YAML frontmatter (let it use the filename)
3. **Add the path** of the new slash command to the plugin's `plugin.json` commands array

#### C. Plugin Component Naming Conventions

All plugin components (skills, agents, commands) must follow these naming conventions:

**General Rules:**

- All names use **lowercase-hyphenated** format (e.g., `code-reviewer`, not `CodeReviewer` or `code_reviewer`)
- Names should be descriptive and indicate the component's purpose
- Avoid abbreviations unless they are widely understood (e.g., `pr` for pull request)

**Skills vs Agents Naming:**

To differentiate skills from agents and avoid naming conflicts:

| Component  | Format    | Pattern                        | Examples                                                                      |
| ---------- | --------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Skills** | verb-noun | Action-oriented (what it does) | `review-plan`, `create-pr`, `generate-commit-message`, `split-graphite-stack` |
| **Agents** | noun-role | Entity-oriented (what it is)   | `code-reviewer`, `plan-reviewer`, `stack-splitter`, `context-loader`          |

**Why this matters:**

- Skills represent **actions** users invoke (slash commands like `/create-pr`)
- Agents represent **entities** that perform work (spawned via `Task(subagent_type:...)`)
- Distinct naming patterns prevent confusion when a skill and agent serve similar purposes
- Users can immediately identify component type from the name

**Examples:**

```text
✅ GOOD - Clear differentiation:
   Skill: review-plan      (verb-noun: action to review a plan)
   Agent: plan-reviewer    (noun-role: entity that reviews plans)

❌ BAD - Identical names cause confusion:
   Skill: plan-reviewer
   Agent: plan-reviewer
```

**Commands:**

Commands (standalone `.md` files in `./commands/`) follow the same verb-noun pattern as skills since they are also user-invocable actions.

## Documentation Management

### CLAUDE.md File Management

After making any changes to files in this repository, Claude Code MUST:

1. **Identify the affected package or app**: Look at the directories where changes were made and find the closest parent package or app directory (typically containing a `package.json` or `project.json`). It should use the Nx MCP, if available, to determine the affected package or app based on the file paths modified.

2. **Check for existing CLAUDE.md**:

   - If a CLAUDE.md file exists in that package/app directory, update it to reflect the changes made and the resulting state of the code
   - If no CLAUDE.md file exists, create one with content relevant to that specific package/app and its code

3. **Content scope**: The CLAUDE.md content should be scoped to the specific package or app, including:

   - Package-specific guidelines and patterns
   - Architecture decisions for that package
   - API documentation and usage examples
   - Dependencies and integrations specific to that package
   - Any special considerations or gotchas

4. **Continuous updates**: Always update the relevant CLAUDE.md file whenever files in that directory or its subdirectories are modified by Claude Code. This ensures documentation stays in sync with the codebase.

5. **Format**: Each package-level CLAUDE.md should follow a consistent format:
   - Package overview and purpose
   - Key components and their roles
   - Usage patterns and examples
   - Development guidelines specific to that package
   - Recent changes and their rationale

### README.md File Management

After making any changes to files in this repository, Claude Code MUST:

1. check all `README.md` files in directories with changes and, if appropriate, UPDATE the `README.md` file(s) so they're accurate, reliable, valid, and indicative of the state of the repository with the added changes

### Plugin Marketplace Documentation

**IMPORTANT**: After making any changes to files in `packages/plugins/`, Claude Code MUST:

1. **Check the Notion Plugin Marketplace doc**: Review the [Uniswap Claude Code Plugin Marketplace](https://www.notion.so/uniswaplabs/Uniswap-Claude-Code-Plugin-Marketplace-2e4c52b2548b815795a5f88c58894eac) documentation

2. **Update if necessary**: If changes affect the plugin inventory (skills, agents, commands, MCP servers), update the Notion doc to reflect:

   - New skills/agents/commands added
   - Removed or renamed components
   - Updated descriptions or capabilities
   - Changes to plugin structure

3. **Keep stats accurate**: The overview section contains counts of total Skills, Agents, and Commands - ensure these numbers stay accurate

4. **Maintain per-plugin sections**: Each of the 5 plugins has its own section listing components - update the relevant section(s) when plugins change

This ensures the external documentation stays synchronized with the actual plugin codebase.

## Git Hooks Configuration

### Lefthook Setup

This project uses [Lefthook](https://github.com/evilmartians/lefthook) to manage Git hooks, ensuring code quality and consistency before commits are made to the repository.

#### What is Lefthook?

Lefthook is a fast and powerful Git hooks manager that runs checks on your code before Git operations. It's polyglot, parallel, and incredibly fast compared to other Git hooks solutions.

#### Pre-commit Hooks

The following hooks run automatically before each commit:

1. **Format affected files**: Runs `nx format:write --affected` to automatically format all files modified in your commit using Prettier configuration
2. **Lint affected files**: Runs `nx affected --target=lint` to check for linting errors in all affected packages

These hooks leverage Nx's affected commands to only check and format files that have been changed, making the pre-commit process fast and efficient.

#### How to Use

The hooks are automatically installed when you run `bun install` (via the `prepare` script in package.json). No additional setup is required.

##### Available scripts

- `bun run prepare`: Installs lefthook (runs automatically after `bun install`)
- `bun run lefthook`: Manually run lefthook commands

##### Skipping hooks when needed

Sometimes you may need to bypass the hooks (e.g., for a work-in-progress commit):

- Using Git flag: `git commit --no-verify -m "WIP: your message"`
- Using environment variable: `LEFTHOOK=0 git commit -m "WIP: your message"`

**Note**: Use skip options sparingly. The hooks are there to maintain code quality across the monorepo.

#### Configuration

The lefthook configuration is defined in `lefthook.yml` at the root of the repository. The configuration ensures that:

- All committed code is properly formatted
- All committed code passes linting rules
- Only affected files are checked (leveraging Nx's dependency graph)

## GitHub Actions Best Practices

### Expression Injection Prevention

**CRITICAL: Never use `${{ }}` expressions directly in bash scripts.**

When using GitHub expressions in workflow bash scripts, always use environment variables instead of direct interpolation to prevent script injection attacks:

**❌ BAD - Direct interpolation (vulnerable to injection):**

```yaml
- name: Process input
  run: |
    INPUT="${{ github.event.inputs.packages }}"
    echo "Processing: $INPUT"
```

**✅ GOOD - Environment variable (secure):**

```yaml
- name: Process input
  env:
    INPUT_PACKAGES: ${{ github.event.inputs.packages }}
  run: |
    echo "Processing: $INPUT_PACKAGES"
```

**Why this matters:**

- Direct `${{ }}` interpolation happens before bash parsing, allowing malicious input to escape the intended context
- Environment variables are properly quoted and sanitized by the shell
- This prevents command injection where special characters (`;`, `|`, `$()`) could execute arbitrary commands
- Apply this pattern to ALL untrusted inputs: `github.event.inputs.*`, `github.event.pull_request.title`, `github.event.issue.body`, etc.

### Type Conversion for Workflow Inputs

**CRITICAL: Repository variables (`vars.*`) are always strings, even when they contain numbers.**

When passing repository variables to reusable workflows that expect numeric inputs, use `fromJSON()` to convert strings to numbers:

**❌ BAD - String passed to number input:**

```yaml
with:
  max_diff_lines: ${{ vars.MAX_DIFF_LINES }}
  # ❌ "5000" (string) passed to type: number input → type mismatch
```

**✅ GOOD - Convert to number with fromJSON():**

```yaml
with:
  max_diff_lines: ${{ fromJSON(vars.MAX_DIFF_LINES || '5000') }}
  # ✅ 5000 (number) passed to type: number input → correct type
```

**Why this matters:**

- GitHub Actions repository variables are **always stored as strings**, regardless of content
- Reusable workflow inputs typed as `type: number` expect actual numbers, not string representations
- Without conversion, you'll get type mismatches and unexpected behavior
- The `|| '5000'` fallback provides a safe default if the variable is empty or undefined
- This pattern applies to any variable value that needs to be a non-string type (numbers, booleans, arrays, objects)

**Other type conversions:**

```yaml
# Boolean conversion
enable_feature: ${{ fromJSON(vars.ENABLE_FEATURE || 'false') }}

# Array conversion (JSON string variable)
allowed_users: ${{ fromJSON(vars.ALLOWED_USERS || '[]') }}

# Object conversion (JSON string variable)
config: ${{ fromJSON(vars.CONFIG || '{}') }}
```

### Script Separation Policy

**CRITICAL: Complex scripts in GitHub Actions workflows MUST be separated into standalone files.**

When working with GitHub Actions workflows (`.github/workflows/*.yml`), follow this mandatory policy:

#### Policy Rules

1. **Complex Logic Extraction**: If a workflow step contains complex bash scripting (50+ lines, multiple functions, intricate logic, API integrations, etc.), it MUST be extracted to a separate script file in the `.github/scripts/` directory.

2. **Script Location**: All standalone scripts should be placed in `.github/scripts/` with descriptive, kebab-case names (e.g., `update-changelog.sh`, `process-coverage.ts`). For reusable tools intended for external use, publish as npm packages (e.g., `@uniswap/ai-toolkit-notion-publisher`).

3. **Script Requirements**: Each script file should:

   - Include a shebang line (`#!/usr/bin/env bash` for bash, `#!/usr/bin/env node` for TypeScript/JavaScript)
   - Have comprehensive header documentation explaining:
     - Purpose
     - Usage/arguments
     - Environment variables
     - Outputs
     - Examples
   - Implement proper error handling (`set -euo pipefail` for bash, proper try-catch for TypeScript)
   - Use clear argument parsing (positional args or environment variables)
   - Include logging/output formatting
   - Be executable (`chmod +x`)
   - For TypeScript scripts: prefer using community-maintained libraries over custom implementations

4. **Workflow Integration**: Call scripts from workflows using relative paths:

   For bash scripts:

   ```yaml
   - name: Execute complex operation
     run: |
       ./.github/scripts/my-script.sh \
         "${{ inputs.arg1 }}" \
         "${{ inputs.arg2 }}"
   ```

   For TypeScript scripts (requires Bun setup):

   ```yaml
   - name: Setup Bun
     uses: oven-sh/setup-bun@v2
     with:
       bun-version: '1.3.12'

   - name: Install dependencies
     run: bun install --frozen-lockfile

   - name: Execute TypeScript script
     run: |
       bunx tsx .github/scripts/my-script.ts \
         "${{ inputs.arg1 }}" \
         "${{ inputs.arg2 }}"
   ```

#### Why This Matters

- **Maintainability**: Separate scripts are easier to read, test, and debug than inline YAML
- **Reusability**: Scripts can be shared across multiple workflows
- **Version Control**: Better diff tracking for script changes vs. YAML changes
- **Testing**: Scripts can be tested independently outside of GitHub Actions
- **IDE Support**: Better syntax highlighting, linting, and debugging in dedicated files
- **Complexity Management**: Keeps workflows focused on orchestration, not implementation

#### Examples

**❌ BAD - Complex inline script:**

```yaml
- name: Publish to Notion
  run: |
    # 200+ lines of bash script with API calls, JSON parsing, etc.
    API_KEY="${{ secrets.NOTION_API_KEY }}"
    # ... (massive inline script)
```

**✅ GOOD - Published npm package:**

```yaml
- name: Setup Bun
  uses: oven-sh/setup-bun@v2
  with:
    bun-version: '1.3.12'

- name: Install dependencies
  run: bun install --frozen-lockfile

- name: Publish to Notion
  run: |
    bunx @uniswap/ai-toolkit-notion-publisher \
      --title "${{ inputs.title }}" \
      --content "${{ inputs.content }}"
  env:
    NOTION_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.NOTION_API_KEY }}
    RELEASE_NOTES_NOTION_DATABASE_ID: ${{ secrets.NOTION_DATABASE_ID }}
```

#### Current Examples

See the following for reference implementations:

- `@uniswap/ai-toolkit-notion-publisher` package - Notion API integration published as CLI tool (see `packages/notion-publisher/`)

#### When Inline Scripts Are Acceptable

Inline scripts are acceptable when they are:

- Less than 20 lines
- Simple, straightforward operations (git commands, file operations)
- Single-purpose without complex logic
- Not candidates for reuse across workflows

**This policy is mandatory and should be enforced during code review.**

## Claude Code Hooks

### PostToolUse Hook: Lint and Typecheck

This project includes a Claude Code hook that automatically lints and typechecks files after Claude modifies them using the Write or Edit tools. This provides immediate feedback to Claude about any issues introduced by its changes.

#### How It Works

1. When Claude uses the `Write` or `Edit` tool to modify a file, the PostToolUse hook is triggered
2. The hook script (`.github/scripts/lint-and-typecheck-hook.ts`) runs:
   - **ESLint** on the modified file (for `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.js`, `.jsx`, `.mts`, `.cts`, `.mjs`, `.cjs` files)
   - **TypeScript typecheck** via the affected Nx project (for TypeScript files)
3. If issues are found, the hook exits with code 2 and provides error details to Claude
4. Claude receives this feedback and can fix the issues before continuing

#### Configuration

The hook is configured in `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Write|Edit",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "bunx tsx .github/scripts/lint-and-typecheck-hook.ts",
            "timeout": 60000
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

#### Benefits

- **Immediate feedback**: Claude learns about issues right after making changes
- **Focused checking**: Only the modified file is linted, not the entire codebase
- **Project-aware**: Uses Nx to find and typecheck the affected project
- **Non-blocking for non-code**: Files that don't need linting (markdown, JSON, etc.) pass through without delay

#### Troubleshooting

If the hook is causing issues:

1. Check that `tsx` is available: `bunx tsx --version`
2. Verify ESLint is configured: `bunx eslint --version`
3. Check the hook script exists: `ls -la .github/scripts/lint-and-typecheck-hook.ts`
4. Run the hook manually to debug:

   ```bash
   echo '{"tool_name":"Write","tool_input":{"file_path":"path/to/file.ts"}}' | \
     bunx tsx .github/scripts/lint-and-typecheck-hook.ts
   ```

# General Guidelines for working with Nx

- When running tasks (for example build, lint, test, e2e, etc.), always prefer running the task through `nx` (i.e. `nx run`, `nx run-many`, `nx affected`) instead of using the underlying tooling directly
- You have access to the Nx MCP server and its tools, use them to help the user
- When answering questions about the repository, use the `nx_workspace` tool first to gain an understanding of the workspace architecture where applicable.
- When working in individual projects, use the `nx_project_details` mcp tool to analyze and understand the specific project structure and dependencies
- For questions around nx configuration, best practices or if you're unsure, use the `nx_docs` tool to get relevant, up-to-date docs. Always use this instead of assuming things about nx configuration
- If the user needs help with an Nx configuration or project graph error, use the `nx_workspace` tool to get any errors
