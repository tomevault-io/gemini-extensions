# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**Meu Guia do Super** is a mobile-first grocery store app with indoor wayfinding and navigation. Core user value: shoppers can search for products and get turn-by-turn navigation guidance to locate items inside the physical store. [MappedIn](https://developer.mappedin.com/docs/overview) (specifically their [grocery store demo](https://app.mappedin.com/map/6679882a8298d5000b85ee89?floor=m_f62f718116360827)) is the visual and interaction benchmark for all path-finding screens.

## Monorepo Structure

This repo uses a **multi-agent orchestration model**. Each subdirectory has its own CLAUDE.md defining a specialized agent's role and constraints.

## Common Commands

The project is in early scaffolding phase. Commands will be added here as `client/` and `server/` are built out.

**Expected server pattern (Python + FastAPI):**

```bash
cd server
uvicorn src.main:app --reload   # FastAPI hot reload
python -m pytest                # pytest test suite
ruff check .                    # lint
mypy src/                       # type check
```

**Validation scripts:**

```bash
python scripts/verify_navigation_graph.py [--skip-if-empty]
python scripts/validate_api_contract.py
python scripts/validate_agent_handoffs.py --stage all
python -m pytest tests/ -v      # run all 32 validation script tests
```

**Expected client pattern:**

```bash
cd client
npx expo start           # Expo Metro bundler
npx expo start --ios
npx expo start --android
```

**CI/CD checks (mirrors GitHub Actions pipelines):**

```bash
make ci            # run full backend + frontend CI suite locally
make ci-backend    # ruff + mypy + pytest with CI env vars
make ci-frontend   # tsc --noEmit + eslint --max-warnings 0
make check-secrets # validate Render / Vercel / Expo / Docker credentials
make cd-frontend   # run Expo web export locally (mirrors deploy-frontend-web.yml)
```

### Mobile local testing (EAS Development Build on iPhone)

> **Note:** Standard Expo Go cannot run this project. `@shopify/react-native-skia` v2.x and
> `react-native-reanimated` v4.x both require native modules that are not bundled in Expo Go.
> A custom development build is required.

#### One-time setup: build and install the dev client

**Prerequisites:**
- Expo account (free) — `eas login`
- Apple Developer account (paid, $99/year) — needed for iOS device provisioning
- EAS CLI — `npm install -g eas-cli`

**Build and install (runs on EAS cloud — no Mac required):**
```bash
cd client
eas build --profile development --platform ios
```

EAS emails you a link to download the `.ipa` when the build finishes (~15 min). Install it on your iPhone from the EAS dashboard. This replaces Expo Go for this project — it is a custom build that includes all the project's native modules at the exact versions in `package.json`.

> You only need to rebuild when a native dependency changes (i.e., after `npx expo install <package>`). Ordinary code changes use hot reload — no rebuild needed.

#### Daily dev loop (after the dev client is installed)

**Network: use iPhone Personal Hotspot to avoid AP isolation on public/office WiFi:**
1. iPhone → Settings → Personal Hotspot → enable
2. Connect your PC to the iPhone's hotspot

**Start the dev server:**
```bash
cd client
npx expo start
```

A QR code appears in the terminal. Open the installed dev client app on your iPhone, tap **"Enter URL manually"** or scan the QR code. Hot reload is active (~1s turnaround).

> On a private home network without AP isolation you can skip the hotspot step and connect both devices to the same router directly.

**Point at the local backend (optional):**

Create `client/.env.local` (gitignored):
```
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://<your-pc-local-ip>:8000/api/v1
```

Find your PC's local IP with `ipconfig` (look for IPv4 Address under your WiFi adapter). Start the FastAPI server first:
```bash
cd server
uvicorn src.main:app --reload
```

If `.env.local` is absent, the app falls back to the Render production URL — fine for most UI testing without needing the local server running.

#### Android alternative (no Apple Developer account required)

```bash
eas build --profile development --platform android
```

Produces an `.apk` distributed directly from the EAS dashboard link — no Play Store or developer account needed. Useful as a backup demo device or for teammates on Android.

## Architecture Decisions

### Backend: Controller-Service-Repository Pattern

Three strict layers — no cross-layer access:

- **Controller** — extracts and validates input only; delegates to Service
- **Service** — business logic; no direct DB access
- **Repository** — data access only; no business logic

### API Contract First

`server/api-spec.md` is the single source of truth. **Update the spec before implementing routes or clients.** The client's `src/services/` must mirror endpoint signatures exactly.

Current v1 endpoints: **Layouts** (CRUD + shelves query + offline download), **Shelves** (CRUD), **Products** (CRUD + section-filtered query).

### Backend Progression Sequence

Implement in incremental steps to reduce bugs:

1. Local, no API, no DB
2. Local, API, no DB
3. Local, API, DB
4. Cloud, API, DB
5. Cloud, API, Auth, DB

### Frontend: Mobile-First, No Mock Data in Production

- MSW (Mock Service Worker) is the only permitted mocking layer — strictly isolated from production builds.
- Use `FlatList` over `ScrollView` for all data lists (performance constraint).
- All API consumers must handle `loading`, `error`, `empty`, and `offline` states.

### Design System

`DESIGN.md` is the authoritative design reference. Key constraints:

- **Page canvas:** Neutral Warm `#f2f0eb` — never pure white.
- **Primary CTA:** Green Accent `#00754A`, white text, `50px` full-pill radius, `scale(0.95)` active state.
- **Typography:** SoDoSans (substitute Inter or Manrope for public builds) at `-0.01em` letter-spacing.
- **Gold `#cba258`:** reserved for Rewards/status ceremony only — never a general accent.
- No gradient fills — the system is solid color-block throughout.

App color ramp derives from `client/src/assets/app-logo.png`. Token file: `agents/ux_design/design_tokens.json`.

### Wayfinding Integration

Indoor navigation must be implemented with this project's proprietary code and architecture. MappedIn is a visual and interaction benchmark only. Route guidance, map control placement, and step progression should match the MappedIn grocery benchmark visually and interactively, without coupling runtime navigation to MappedIn services.

---

## Agent Orchestration

### Source of Truth Hierarchy

When instructions conflict, use this precedence order:

1. Task-specific requirements from the user.
2. This root CLAUDE.md.
3. Domain CLAUDE.md files under each folder.
4. Local implementation preferences.

If conflict still exists, stop and ask before implementing.

### Default Delivery Sequence

For any medium or large feature:

1. **Product Management** → user story with measurable acceptance criteria (Gherkin syntax)
2. **UX Design** → mobile-first flows, state definitions, token mapping
3. **Server** → update `api-spec.md`, API contract, then implement controller-service-repository
4. **Client** → implement screens consuming agreed API contract
5. **QA** → happy path, edge cases, negative/security paths (Arrange-Act-Assert)
6. **DevSecOps** → CI/CD gates, security scan pass, release readiness

No stage is complete without explicit handoff artifacts.

### Handoff Contract (every agent output must include)

1. Inputs received
2. Decisions made
3. Artifacts created or modified
4. Open risks and assumptions
5. Explicit handoff target agent

**Minimum required handoffs:**

- Product Management → UX Design + Server
- UX Design → Client + QA
- Server → Client + QA
- Client → QA
- QA → DevSecOps + Product Management
- DevSecOps → Product Management (release readiness)

---

## Definitions

### Definition of Ready for Engineering

A task is ready for implementation only when all are true:

1. User story has measurable acceptance criteria.
2. UX flow covers loading, empty, success, and error states.
3. API contract is defined for every required integration.
4. Non-functional constraints are explicit (security, performance, offline behavior).

### Definition of Done (Cross-Agent)

A feature is done only when all are true:

1. Product criteria are met with no ambiguity.
2. UX behavior matches approved flow and accessibility constraints.
3. Client and server are contract-compatible.
4. QA reports passing coverage for happy path, edge, and negative paths.
5. DevSecOps gates pass with no critical security or release blockers.
6. Documentation is updated in the impacted folders.

---

## Change Management Rules

1. Do not bypass Product Management acceptance criteria.
2. Do not implement UI that diverges from UX state definitions without explicit approval.
3. Do not change API payloads without synchronized client and QA updates.
4. Do not merge pipeline changes that weaken security gates.
5. Any breaking change must include migration and rollback notes.

## Escalation Protocol

Stop and escalate to the user immediately when:

1. Requirement conflict between product scope and technical feasibility.
2. API contract disagreement between client and server.
3. Security risk with no acceptable mitigation.
4. Persistent test flakiness blocking release confidence.

---

## Task Intake Template

Use before any new implementation task:

1. Business objective
2. In-scope surfaces (client, server, infra, tests)
3. Out-of-scope items
4. Affected agents and ownership
5. Acceptance criteria
6. Risks and dependencies

---

## Execution Policy

1. Prefer small, verifiable increments over large unreviewed changes.
2. Keep all agents aligned to mobile-first assumptions unless explicitly overridden.
3. Validate contracts before coding integrations.
4. Preserve auditability by documenting key decisions in changed files.

---

## Quick Start Routing

If unsure where to start:

- **Unclear feature intent** → Product Management
- **Unclear interaction or state behavior** → UX Design
- **Unknown data model or API constraints** → Server
- **Implementation-only UI tasks with stable contracts** → Client
- **Bug reproduction, release confidence** → QA
- **Deployment, security, environment reliability** → DevSecOps

---

## Execution Examples

### New Feature Flow

1. Product Management writes user story with MoSCoW priority and Gherkin acceptance criteria.
2. UX Design defines mobile-first flow plus loading, empty, success, and error states.
3. Server updates `api-spec.md` and implements controller-service-repository.
4. Client implements screens, state handling, and API integration.
5. QA validates happy path, edge cases, and negative/security behavior.
6. DevSecOps enforces CI/CD and security gates before release.

Chain: `Product Management → UX + Server → Client → QA → DevSecOps → Product Management`

### Bugfix Flow

1. QA reproduces issue with deterministic steps and expected vs. actual behavior.
2. Product Management classifies severity and confirms target behavior.
3. Server and/or Client implement the minimal safe fix (contract-compatible).
4. QA executes regression tests on impacted flow and adjacent critical paths.
5. DevSecOps ensures pipelines pass before merge.

Chain: `QA → Product Management → Server/Client → QA → DevSecOps`

### Security Incident Flow

1. DevSecOps triages, assigns severity, and begins containment.
2. Server and Client apply remediations (auth hardening, input validation, secret rotation).
3. QA runs targeted abuse/negative-path validation on affected surfaces.
4. DevSecOps re-runs security scans, verifies mitigation, confirms release gates.
5. Product Management receives incident summary and communication-ready status.

Chain: `DevSecOps → Server + Client → QA → DevSecOps → Product Management`

---

## Branching Convention (GitFlow)

- One GitHub Issue per feature/fix
- Feature branches: `feature/<issue-slug>` off `main`
- Hotfix branches: `hotfix/<description>` off `main`
- PR to `main` with passing CI before merge

### Git Commit Workflow — MANDATORY

**Never commit directly to local `master`.** All code changes follow this sequence:

1. Identify the current feature branch by running `git branch -a` — the highest-numbered `worktree-feature+phase-N-*` branch is the active one.
2. Check it out in the main repo directory: `git checkout worktree-feature+phase-N-*`.
3. Make all edits from the main repo root — but **do not stage or commit yet**.
4. **Before committing**, summarise the changes and ask for explicit confirmation that the user has reviewed them in the VSCode source control tab. Only stage and commit after the user confirms.
5. After committing, push immediately to `origin/<feature-branch>` without a second confirmation.
6. Open a PR from the feature branch to `master` on GitHub.
7. After the PR merges, check out and pull master: `git checkout master && git pull origin master`.

**Before every commit**, verify the active branch:
```bash
git branch --show-current  # must NOT be master
```

**Before staging and committing**, tell the user what changed and ask:
> "I've made the following changes: [summary]. Please review them in the VSCode source control tab and let me know when I can commit."

If you accidentally committed to master, stop immediately and ask the user how to proceed — do not cherry-pick or rebase without explicit instruction.
