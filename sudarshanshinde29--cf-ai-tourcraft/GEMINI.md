<elicitation_specification>

### MCP Elicitation Protocol

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) provides a standardized way for servers to request additional information from users through the client during interactions. This flow allows clients to maintain control over user interactions and data sharing while enabling servers to gather necessary information dynamically.

#### User Interaction Model

Elicitation in MCP allows servers to implement interactive workflows by enabling user input requests to occur *nested* inside other MCP server features. Implementations are free to expose elicitation through any interface pattern that suits their needs—the protocol itself does not mandate any specific user interaction model.

**Security Requirements:**
- Servers **MUST NOT** use elicitation to request sensitive information
- Applications **SHOULD** provide UI that makes it clear which server is requesting information
- Applications **SHOULD** allow users to review and modify their responses before sending
- Applications **SHOULD** respect user privacy and provide clear decline and cancel options

#### Capabilities Declaration

Clients that support elicitation **MUST** declare the `elicitation` capability during initialization:

```json
{
  "capabilities": {
    "elicitation": {}
  }
}
```

#### Protocol Messages

**Creating Elicitation Requests:**

Servers send an `elicitation/create` request to request information from users:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "elicitation/create",
  "params": {
    "message": "Please provide your GitHub username",
    "requestedSchema": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "name": {
          "type": "string"
        }
      },
      "required": ["name"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Response Actions:**

Elicitation responses use a three-action model:

1. **Accept** (`action: "accept"`): User explicitly approved and submitted with data
   ```json
   {
     "jsonrpc": "2.0",
     "id": 1,
     "result": {
       "action": "accept",
       "content": {
         "name": "octocat"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Decline** (`action: "decline"`): User explicitly declined the request
   ```json
   {
     "jsonrpc": "2.0",
     "id": 1,
     "result": {
       "action": "decline"
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Cancel** (`action: "cancel"`): User dismissed without making an explicit choice
   ```json
   {
     "jsonrpc": "2.0",
     "id": 1,
     "result": {
       "action": "cancel"
     }
   }
   ```

#### Request Schema

The `requestedSchema` field allows servers to define the structure of the expected response using a restricted subset of JSON Schema. Elicitation schemas are limited to flat objects with primitive properties only:

**Supported Schema Types:**

1. **String Schema:**
   ```json
   {
     "type": "string",
     "title": "Display Name",
     "description": "Description text",
     "minLength": 3,
     "maxLength": 50,
     "pattern": "^[A-Za-z]+$",
     "format": "email",
     "default": "user@example.com"
   }
   ```
   Supported formats: `email`, `uri`, `date`, `date-time`

2. **Number Schema:**
   ```json
   {
     "type": "number",
     "title": "Display Name",
     "description": "Description text",
     "minimum": 0,
     "maximum": 100,
     "default": 50
   }
   ```

3. **Boolean Schema:**
   ```json
   {
     "type": "boolean",
     "title": "Display Name",
     "description": "Description text",
     "default": false
   }
   ```

4. **Enum Schema:**
   ```json
   {
     "type": "string",
     "title": "Display Name",
     "description": "Description text",
     "enum": ["option1", "option2", "option3"],
     "enumNames": ["Option 1", "Option 2", "Option 3"],
     "default": "option1"
   }
   ```

#### Security Considerations

1. Servers **MUST NOT** request sensitive information through elicitation
2. Clients **SHOULD** implement user approval controls
3. Both parties **SHOULD** validate elicitation content against the provided schema
4. Clients **SHOULD** provide clear indication of which server is requesting information
5. Clients **SHOULD** allow users to decline elicitation requests at any time
6. Clients **SHOULD** implement rate limiting
7. Clients **SHOULD** present elicitation requests in a way that makes it clear what information is being requested and why

</elicitation_specification>

<roots_specification>

### MCP Roots Protocol

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) provides a standardized way for clients to expose filesystem "roots" to servers. Roots define the boundaries of where servers can operate within the filesystem, allowing them to understand which directories and files they have access to.

#### User Interaction Model

Roots in MCP are typically exposed through workspace or project configuration interfaces. For example, implementations could offer a workspace/project picker that allows users to select directories and files the server should have access to. This can be combined with automatic workspace detection from version control systems or project files.

#### Capabilities Declaration

Clients that support roots **MUST** declare the `roots` capability during initialization:

```json
{
  "capabilities": {
    "roots": {
      "listChanged": true
    }
  }
}
```

`listChanged` indicates whether the client will emit notifications when the list of roots changes.

#### Protocol Messages

**Listing Roots:**

To retrieve roots, servers send a `roots/list` request:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "roots/list"
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": {
    "roots": [
      {
        "uri": "file:///home/user/projects/myproject",
        "name": "My Project"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Root List Changes:**

When roots change, clients that support `listChanged` **MUST** send a notification:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "notifications/roots/list_changed"
}
```

#### Data Types

**Root Definition:**

A root definition includes:
- `uri`: Unique identifier for the root. This **MUST** be a `file://` URI in the current specification
- `name`: Optional human-readable name for display purposes

**Example Use Cases:**

1. **Project Directory:**
   ```json
   {
     "uri": "file:///home/user/projects/myproject",
     "name": "My Project"
   }
   ```

2. **Multiple Repositories:**
   ```json
   [
     {
       "uri": "file:///home/user/repos/frontend",
       "name": "Frontend Repository"
     },
     {
       "uri": "file:///home/user/repos/backend",
       "name": "Backend Repository"
     }
   ]
   ```

#### Error Handling

Clients **SHOULD** return standard JSON-RPC errors for common failure cases:
- Client does not support roots: `-32601` (Method not found)
- Internal errors: `-32603`

**Example Error:**
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "error": {
    "code": -32601,
    "message": "Roots not supported",
    "data": {
      "reason": "Client does not have roots capability"
    }
  }
}
```

#### Security Considerations

**Clients MUST:**
- Only expose roots with appropriate permissions
- Validate all root URIs to prevent path traversal
- Implement proper access controls
- Monitor root accessibility

**Servers SHOULD:**
- Handle cases where roots become unavailable
- Respect root boundaries during operations
- Validate all paths against provided roots

#### Implementation Guidelines

**Clients SHOULD:**
- Prompt users for consent before exposing roots to servers
- Provide clear user interfaces for root management
- Validate root accessibility before exposing
- Monitor for root changes

**Servers SHOULD:**
- Check for roots capability before usage
- Handle root list changes gracefully
- Respect root boundaries in operations
- Cache root information appropriately

</roots_specification>

<sampling_specification>

### MCP Sampling Protocol

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) provides a standardized way for servers to request LLM sampling ("completions" or "generations") from language models via clients. This flow allows clients to maintain control over model access, selection, and permissions while enabling servers to leverage AI capabilities—with no server API keys necessary.

#### User Interaction Model

Sampling in MCP allows servers to implement agentic behaviors, by enabling LLM calls to occur *nested* inside other MCP server features. Implementations are free to expose sampling through any interface pattern that suits their needs—the protocol itself does not mandate any specific user interaction model.

**Security Requirements:**
- There **SHOULD** always be a human in the loop with the ability to deny sampling requests
- Applications **SHOULD** provide UI that makes it easy and intuitive to review sampling requests
- Applications **SHOULD** allow users to view and edit prompts before sending
- Applications **SHOULD** present generated responses for review before delivery

#### Capabilities Declaration

Clients that support sampling **MUST** declare the `sampling` capability during initialization:

```json
{
  "capabilities": {
    "sampling": {}
  }
}
```

#### Protocol Messages

**Creating Messages:**

To request a language model generation, servers send a `sampling/createMessage` request:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "sampling/createMessage",
  "params": {
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": {
          "type": "text",
          "text": "What is the capital of France?"
        }
      }
    ],
    "modelPreferences": {
      "hints": [
        {
          "name": "claude-3-sonnet"
        }
      ],
      "intelligencePriority": 0.8,
      "speedPriority": 0.5
    },
    "systemPrompt": "You are a helpful assistant.",
    "maxTokens": 100
  }
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": {
    "role": "assistant",
    "content": {
      "type": "text",
      "text": "The capital of France is Paris."
    },
    "model": "claude-3-sonnet-20240307",
    "stopReason": "endTurn"
  }
}
```

#### Data Types

**Messages:**

Sampling messages can contain different content types:

1. **Text Content:**
   ```json
   {
     "type": "text",
     "text": "The message content"
   }
   ```

2. **Image Content:**
   ```json
   {
     "type": "image",
     "data": "base64-encoded-image-data",
     "mimeType": "image/jpeg"
   }
   ```

3. **Audio Content:**
   ```json
   {
     "type": "audio",
     "data": "base64-encoded-audio-data",
     "mimeType": "audio/wav"
   }
   ```

**Model Preferences:**

Model selection in MCP requires careful abstraction since servers and clients may use different AI providers with distinct model offerings. A server cannot simply request a specific model by name since the client may not have access to that exact model or may prefer to use a different provider's equivalent model.

**Capability Priorities:**

Servers express their needs through three normalized priority values (0-1):
- `costPriority`: How important is minimizing costs? Higher values prefer cheaper models
- `speedPriority`: How important is low latency? Higher values prefer faster models
- `intelligencePriority`: How important are advanced capabilities? Higher values prefer more capable models

**Model Hints:**

While priorities help select models based on characteristics, `hints` allow servers to suggest specific models or model families:
- Hints are treated as substrings that can match model names flexibly
- Multiple hints are evaluated in order of preference
- Clients **MAY** map hints to equivalent models from different providers
- Hints are advisory—clients make final model selection

**Example Model Preferences:**
```json
{
  "hints": [
    { "name": "claude-3-sonnet" }, // Prefer Sonnet-class models
    { "name": "claude" } // Fall back to any Claude model
  ],
  "costPriority": 0.3, // Cost is less important
  "speedPriority": 0.8, // Speed is very important
  "intelligencePriority": 0.5 // Moderate capability needs
}
```

The client processes these preferences to select an appropriate model from its available options. For instance, if the client doesn't have access to Claude models but has Gemini, it might map the sonnet hint to `gemini-1.5-pro` based on similar capabilities.

#### Error Handling

Clients **SHOULD** return errors for common failure cases:

**Example Error:**
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "error": {
    "code": -1,
    "message": "User rejected sampling request"
  }
}
```

#### Security Considerations

1. Clients **SHOULD** implement user approval controls
2. Both parties **SHOULD** validate message content
3. Clients **SHOULD** respect model preference hints
4. Clients **SHOULD** implement rate limiting
5. Both parties **MUST** handle sensitive data appropriately

</sampling_specification>

<logging_specification>

### MCP Logging Protocol

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) provides a standardized way for servers to send structured log messages to clients. Clients can control logging verbosity by setting minimum log levels, with servers sending notifications containing severity levels, optional logger names, and arbitrary JSON-serializable data.

#### User Interaction Model

Implementations are free to expose logging through any interface pattern that suits their needs—the protocol itself does not mandate any specific user interaction model.

#### Capabilities Declaration

Servers that emit log message notifications **MUST** declare the `logging` capability:

```json
{
  "capabilities": {
    "logging": {}
  }
}
```

#### Log Levels

The protocol follows the standard syslog severity levels specified in RFC 5424:

| Level     | Description                      | Example Use Case           |
| --------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| debug     | Detailed debugging information   | Function entry/exit points |
| info      | General informational messages   | Operation progress updates |
| notice    | Normal but significant events    | Configuration changes      |
| warning   | Warning conditions               | Deprecated feature usage   |
| error     | Error conditions                 | Operation failures         |
| critical  | Critical conditions              | System component failures  |
| alert     | Action must be taken immediately | Data corruption detected   |
| emergency | System is unusable               | Complete system failure    |

#### Protocol Messages

**Setting Log Level:**

To configure the minimum log level, clients **MAY** send a `logging/setLevel` request:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "logging/setLevel",
  "params": {
    "level": "info"
  }
}
```

**Log Message Notifications:**

Servers send log messages using `notifications/message` notifications:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "notifications/message",
  "params": {
    "level": "error",
    "logger": "database",
    "data": {
      "error": "Connection failed",
      "details": {
        "host": "localhost",
        "port": 5432
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Error Handling

Servers **SHOULD** return standard JSON-RPC errors for common failure cases:
- Invalid log level: `-32602` (Invalid params)
- Configuration errors: `-32603` (Internal error)

#### Implementation Considerations

**Servers SHOULD:**
- Rate limit log messages
- Include relevant context in data field
- Use consistent logger names
- Remove sensitive information

**Clients MAY:**
- Present log messages in the UI
- Implement log filtering/search
- Display severity visually
- Persist log messages

#### Security Considerations

**Log messages MUST NOT contain:**
- Credentials or secrets
- Personal identifying information
- Internal system details that could aid attacks

**Implementations SHOULD:**
- Rate limit messages
- Validate all data fields
- Control log access
- Monitor for sensitive content
