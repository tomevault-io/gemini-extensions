Guidance for AI agents working in this repository, covering both using the toolkit as a library (Usage guide) and
extending it (Developer guide). The Invariants section lists rules that apply to every task. When this file and the
code disagree, the code is authoritative; verify against the source before acting on a claim here.

## Overview

AISteer360 is a toolkit for steering large language models (Hugging Face causal LMs). It provides steering methods
("controls") across four model control surfaces, a `SteeringPipeline` that composes controls from any categories into
one operation on a model, and an evaluation stack (use cases, metrics, benchmarks) for comparing steering pipelines.

The four control categories, defined by what a method touches:

- **input**: manipulates the prompt only; generations follow `y ~ p_theta(sigma(x))` for a prompt adapter `sigma`.
- **structural**: persistently modifies weights or architecture (fine-tuning, DPO, merging); `y ~ p_theta'(x)`.
- **state**: edits internal activations at runtime via forward hooks, without changing weights.
- **output**: shapes the decoding process (logits processing, stopping, re-ranking, custom decode loops).

Vocabulary used throughout the codebase:

- **control**: one steering method, subclassing the base class of its category.
- **generic**: a reusable building block in a category's `_common/` library (transforms, gates, drivers, selectors,
  formatters, ...). Named methods are often thin presets over generics.
- **probe**: a calibrated linear readout over hidden states used for detection and routing (reads, never edits).

## Setup and commands

Python 3.11+ with `uv` as the package manager:

```bash
uv venv --python 3.11 && uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
source .venv/bin/activate
```

On Windows, run the two chained commands separately. Optional extras: `merging` (MergeKit), `cpo` (econml), `plots`
(matplotlib/seaborn), `all` (all features), `dev` (`all` plus pytest, pre-commit, notebook), `docs` (site tooling).

Hugging Face access uses a `.env` file at the repo root containing `HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN=hf_***` (see
`.env.example`). Some models (e.g. `meta-llama/*`) are gated; the account behind the token needs access on the
model's Hub page. Never commit tokens; a detect-secrets pre-commit hook scans against `.secrets.baseline`.

Models run inside the current process. Real steering runs need GPU memory for the base checkpoint plus the method's
overhead; for smoke tests use the tiny models listed in `tests/utils/ci_models.yaml`
(e.g. `hf-internal-testing/tiny-random-LlamaForCausalLM`).

Common commands:

```bash
pytest tests/controls/                    # all control tests
pytest tests/controls/test_pasta.py       # one control
pytest tests/core/ tests/internals/       # pipeline, registry, probes
pre-commit install                        # once per clone
pre-commit run --all-files                # detect-secrets, whitespace, isort (black profile)
uv pip install -e ".[docs]" && uv run mkdocs serve   # docs at localhost:8000
```

Tests parametrize over the models in `tests/utils/ci_models.yaml` and over devices (`cpu`, `cuda`, `mps`); unavailable
devices are skipped automatically, so the suite runs on CPU-only machines. Commit messages require a DCO
`Signed-off-by:` line (see `CONTRIBUTING.md`).

## Usage guide

### Minimal steering loop

Every use of the toolkit follows the same loop: instantiate controls, wrap them in a `SteeringPipeline`, call
`steer()` once, then call `generate()` for inference.

```python
from aisteer360.algorithms.core.steering_pipeline import SteeringPipeline
from aisteer360.algorithms.input_control.few_shot.control import FewShot

few_shot = FewShot(
    directive="Answer in a formal, professional tone.",
    positive_example_pool=[
        {"prompt": "hey what's up", "response": "Good afternoon. How may I assist you?"},
        {"prompt": "thx", "response": "You are most welcome."},
    ],
    k_positive=1,
)

pipeline = SteeringPipeline(
    model_name_or_path="meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct",  # any HF causal LM id or local path
    controls=[few_shot],
    device_map="auto",
)
pipeline.steer()  # required once before generate(); heavy work (training, fitting) happens here

response = pipeline.generate(
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Where is the Eiffel Tower?"}],
    max_new_tokens=64,
)
```

Constructor arguments for a control are defined by its `Args` dataclass (in the method's `args.py`) and validated at
construction. For lightweight controls `steer()` only attaches artifacts like the tokenizer; for controls that train
(structural controls, activation-steering fits) the training runs there.

### Choosing a control category

| Goal | Category | Base class |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Change the prompt (few-shot, rewriting, prompt search) | input | `InputControl` |
| Change the weights (fine-tune, DPO, merge) | structural | `StructuralControl` |
| Edit activations or attention at runtime | state | `StateControl` |
| Shape decoding (rerank, guided sampling, custom loops) | output | `OutputControl` / `DecodingDriver` |

### Available controls

Enumerate the live registry rather than trusting any static list:

```python
from aisteer360.algorithms.core.registry import REGISTRY  # import triggers discovery

for category, methods in REGISTRY.items():
    print(category, sorted(methods))
```

The registered names at the time of writing:

- input: `cpo`, `few_shot`, `gepa`, `prewrite`
- state: `act_add`, `activation_adapter`, `angular_steering`, `caa`, `cast`, `directional_ablation`, `iti`, `pasta`
- output: `best_of_n`, `budget_forcing`, `contrastive_decoding`, `contrastive_guidance`, `deal`, `dexperts`,
  `phased_decoding`, `rad`, `routed_decoding`, `sasa`, `search_decoding`, `stopping_rules`, `thinking_intervention`,
  `value_guidance`
- structural: `mergekit`, `sft`, `dpo`, `ppo`, `grpo`, `apo` (MergeKit and TRL wrappers)

### Pipeline semantics

`generate()` dispatches on the declared keyword source (exactly one per call) and returns the matching shape:

| Source | Tokenization | Return |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `text=` (`str`) | plain text | `str` |
| `text=` (`list[str]`) | batched text | `list[str]` |
| `messages=` (one chat) | chat template | `str` |
| `messages=` (batch of chats) | batched chat template | `list[str]` |
| `input_ids=` (tensor / token id lists) | passed through | `torch.Tensor` |

Positional `str`/`list[str]` behaves like `text=`; any other positional shape raises a `TypeError`.

Behaviors that differ from bare Hugging Face usage:

- Returned token ids exclude the prompt by default. Do not slice the result by prompt length; pass
  `return_full_sequence=True` for HF-style prompt-plus-continuation output.
- `generate(..., return_output=True)` returns an `Output` object (or list of them) with three fields: `output_ids`,
  `adapted_input_ids` (the prompt after input controls, useful for inspecting the steered prompt), and a per-item
  `finish_reason` (`"eos"`, `"length"`, or `None`). Import it via `from aisteer360.algorithms.core import Output`.
- `generate()` before `steer()` raises `RuntimeError`; a second `steer()` call is a silent no-op.
- `attention_mask` is valid only with `input_ids=`; it is derived automatically for `text=` and `messages=`, and passing it with either (or with positional text) raises a `TypeError`.
- `device` and a non-default `device_map` are mutually exclusive on the `SteeringPipeline` constructor.
- Pass `lazy_init=True` when a structural control produces the final weights itself (e.g. `mergekit`); the base model
  is then not loaded at construction and the structural control must return one during `steer()`.
- `pipeline.supports_batching` is `True` only when every enabled control declares batch safety; evaluation utilities
  batch when it is `True` and fall back to per-example generation otherwise.
- `pipeline.compute_logprobs(input_ids, ref_output_ids=...)` scores reference tokens teacher-forced with the full
  steering applied; output controls with `include_in_scoring=False` are excluded from scoring.
- Controls with a `tokenizer` attribute left as `None` get the pipeline tokenizer injected automatically.

### Composition rules

- A pipeline accepts any number of controls per category. `steer()` runs in a fixed bottom-up order (structural, then
  input, then state, then output) and in list order within each category, so higher layers always see the final model.
- At most one enabled `DecodingDriver` may be present; the decode loop does not compose. When none is supplied the
  pipeline uses `model.generate`. Step-level output controls (processors, stopping criteria) compose freely.
- Input controls run in two phases on chat input. Every control's `adapt_messages` runs in list order before chat
  templating; controls whose `adapt_messages` returns `None` then run their token-level `adapt` in list order after
  tokenization. Text and tensor inputs skip the message phase entirely. Place semantic rewriters (`prewrite`, `cpo`,
  `gepa`) before surface formatters (`few_shot`) in the controls list.
- State hooks register in list order and chain on the same module, so non-commuting edits (e.g. ablate then add
  versus add then ablate) are order sensitive.
- Structural controls thread the model: each receives the model returned by the previous one, with no implicit
  reconciliation between stages.

### Runtime kwargs

Some controls need per-call information at inference time. All controls read from the single `runtime_kwargs` dict
passed to `generate()`; each control declares the names it consumes in its `RUNTIME_KWARGS_SCHEMA`, and the pipeline
warns at `steer()` time when two controls declare the same name (they will share one value).

```python
pipeline.generate(
    prompt,
    runtime_kwargs={"substrings": ["The answer must be in JSON."]},  # e.g. pasta's emphasis spans
    max_new_tokens=128,
)
```

### Evaluation

A `Metric` implements `compute(responses, prompts=None, **kwargs) -> dict` (subclass `LLMJudgeMetric` for judge-based
scoring). A `UseCase` bundles `evaluation_data` and `evaluation_metrics` and implements `generate()` and `evaluate()`.
A `Benchmark` compares steering pipelines on one use case:

```python
from aisteer360.algorithms.core.specs import ControlSpec
from aisteer360.evaluation.benchmark import Benchmark

benchmark = Benchmark(
    use_case=use_case,
    base_model_name_or_path="meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct",
    steering_pipelines={
        "baseline": [],  # empty list denotes the unsteered baseline
        "few_shot": [few_shot],
        "caa_sweep": [ControlSpec(control_cls=CAA, params={"data": caa_train_data}, vars={"multiplier": [1.0, 2.0]})],
    },
    runtime_overrides={"PASTA": {"substrings": "emphasis_column"}},  # routed by control class name
    num_trials=3,
    save_dir="runs/exp1",  # checkpoint.json written per completed config; resume skips completed work
)
profiles = benchmark.run()
```

`ControlSpec.vars` accepts a mapping (cartesian grid, traversed fully or sampled via `search_strategy="random"` and
`num_samples`), a sequence of parameter dicts, or a callable yielding dicts given a context. Each trial reuses the
same steered model and re-samples generate-time randomness; pipelines with a structural control load a fresh model,
while others reuse a shared preloaded base model. `runtime_overrides` is keyed by control class name, so two
instances of one class in a pipeline share a single entry.

## Developer guide

### Adding a steering control

A method is a sub-package of its category directory with a three-file layout:

```
aisteer360/algorithms/<category>_control/<method_name>/
├── __init__.py    # exports STEERING_METHOD for registry discovery
├── args.py        # hyperparameter dataclass (single source of truth)
├── control.py     # the control class; all steering behavior lives here
└── utils/         # optional local helpers; use sparingly
```

`args.py` defines every hyperparameter as a `BaseArgs` dataclass; use `__post_init__` for cross-field validation:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass, field

from aisteer360.algorithms.core.base_args import BaseArgs


@dataclass
class MyMethodArgs(BaseArgs):
    """Arguments for MyMethod."""

    strength: float = field(default=1.0, metadata={"help": "Scale applied to the steering edit."})

    def __post_init__(self):
        if self.strength <= 0:
            raise ValueError("strength must be positive.")
```

`control.py` subclasses the category base and sets `Args = MyMethodArgs`. The base constructor validates the args and
promotes every field to an instance attribute (`self.strength`), so the control class defines no `__init__` of its
own in the common case. Required hooks per category:

- **input**: `adapt(input_ids, runtime_kwargs) -> input_ids` (required); optionally `adapt_messages(messages,
  runtime_kwargs) -> messages | None` for pre-template chat editing. A non-`None` return from `adapt_messages` skips
  that control's token-level `adapt` for the call, so implementing both does not double-apply.
- **structural**: `steer(model, tokenizer, **kwargs) -> PreTrainedModel`; return the new or modified model.
- **state**: `get_hooks(input_ids, runtime_kwargs, **kwargs) -> {"pre": [...], "forward": [...], "backward": [...]}`
  where each spec is `{"module": <dotted submodule path>, "hook_func": <callable>}`. Registration, context-managed
  lifetime, and removal are provided by the base; a default `reset()` covers the `_gate`/`_runtime`
  convention, so override (optionally calling `super().reset()`) only for additional per-generation state.
- **output**, step-level: `get_logits_processors(...)` and `get_stopping_criteria(...)`, returning fresh instances on
  each call. Loop-owning methods subclass `DecodingDriver` and implement `decode(input_ids, attention_mask, model,
  logits_processors, stopping_criteria, runtime_kwargs, **gen_kwargs)`, returning full prompt-plus-continuation ids
  and applying the received stacks at every scoring step.
- **all categories**: optional `steer()` for one-time preparation and `cleanup()` for releasing resources.

Declare the class attributes the pipeline reads: `supports_batching` (default `False`; set `True` only
when the control is batch-safe), `enabled`, `RUNTIME_KWARGS_SCHEMA` (a list of `{"name": ...}` entries), and for
output controls `include_in_scoring` and `same_model_forwards`.

`__init__.py` exports the discovery dict:

```python
from .args import MyMethodArgs
from .control import MyMethod

STEERING_METHOD = {
    "category": "state_control",
    "name": "my_method",
    "control": MyMethod,
    "args": MyMethodArgs,
}
```

The registry crawls the category directories at import time, requires the `name`, `control`, and `args` keys, and
rejects duplicate names. For a method with a heavy optional dependency, import it through
`aisteer360.utils.optional.require("<module>")` at the module boundary and add the extra to `pyproject.toml` (and to
`OPTIONAL_MODULE_EXTRAS` in `aisteer360/utils/optional.py`); discovery then skips the method with an actionable hint
when the dependency is absent instead of failing.

### Generics before new machinery

Before writing new components, check the category's `_common/` library and compose from it:

- **state**: transforms (`AdditiveTransform`, `DirectionalAblationTransform`, `RotationTransform`,
  `HeadAdditiveTransform`, `NormPreservingTransform`, `AlignmentAdaptiveTransform`), estimators
  (`MeanDifferenceEstimator`, `ContrastiveDirectionEstimator`, `SinglePairEstimator`, `SteeringPlaneEstimator`),
  gates (`AlwaysOpenGate`, `CacheOnceGate`, `MultiKeyThresholdGate`, `ProbeSumGate`), selectors
  (`FixedLayerSelector`, `FractionalDepthSelector`, `TopKHeadSelector`, `ConditionPointSelector`), condition
  scorers, token scopes, `SteeringVector`, and `TransformHookRuntime`.
- **output**: `SearchDriver` (propose, score, keep, iterate) and `PhasedDriver` (`Fixed` / `Generated` phase plans),
  processors (`PrefixKeyedProcessor` base, constraint, contrastive mixture, value-guided), scorers (reward model,
  metric, majority vote), value functions, criteria (`StopOnSubstring`, `BudgetTokens`), and KV-cache utilities.
- **input**: memories (text, pool), formatters (system prompt, few-shot block, prepend, chat-template slot),
  proposers (LLM meta-prompt, retrieval), scorers, selectors (random, top-k, MMR, dense retrieval), and
  budget/Pareto utilities.
- **detection**: probes live in `core/internals/probes` (`fit_probe`, `calibrate_bias`, `ProbeSet`, `RoutingRules`);
  prefer these over ad hoc classifiers for gating and routing.

Published methods are frequently presets over generics (`deal` presets `SearchDriver`; `thinking_intervention`
presets `PhasedDriver`; `caa` composes an estimator with `AdditiveTransform`). Driver presets map their `Args` onto
the generic base's fields in `_configure()` rather than overriding `__init__`; follow that pattern for new decoding
methods. Before writing a new state control, check whether an `ActivationAdapter` configuration (transform, layer
selector, gate, token scope) already covers the behavior.

### Adding metrics and use cases

A metric subclasses `Metric` (or `LLMJudgeMetric` from `evaluation/metrics/base_judge.py`) and implements
`compute(responses, prompts=None, **kwargs) -> dict`. Task-agnostic metrics go in `evaluation/metrics/generic/`;
task-specific ones in `evaluation/metrics/custom/<use_case>/`.

A use case is a folder `evaluation/use_cases/<name>/` containing `use_case.py` with a `UseCase` subclass implementing
`generate()` and `evaluate()`. Follow the existing use cases, where `generate()` builds prompts and calls
`batch_retry_generate` from `evaluation/utils/generation_utils.py` (batched decoding with parsing and retry), and
`evaluate()` maps metric names to computed results.

### Testing

Fixtures in `tests/conftest.py` provide a parametrized `device` fixture (`cpu` / `cuda` / `mps`, skipping unavailable
devices), a session-scoped `model_and_tokenizer` fixture over the tiny models in `tests/utils/ci_models.yaml`, mock
controls for every category, and evaluation fixtures. A new control needs `tests/controls/test_<method>.py` following
the existing pattern: a parameter grid expanded with `build_param_grid()`, then build the control, wrap it in a
`SteeringPipeline`, `steer()`, `generate()`, and assert on the output. Unit-test any new generics directly
(`tests/controls/` for control components, `tests/internals/` for the probes substrate, `tests/core/` for pipeline
behavior).

### Code style

- Python 3.11+ with modern typing (`list`, `dict`, `T | None`); line length 120; snake_case variables, PascalCase
  classes, UPPER_SNAKE_CASE constants; descriptive, not overly abbreviated, names.
- Comments describe current functionality only, in lowercase, with two spaces before inline comments
  (`a = 1  # some comment`) and no decorative formatting. Do not narrate edits or prior designs.
- Use a module logger (`logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)`) instead of `print` in library code.
- Keep imports simple; use the optional-dependency guard rather than broad try/except import fallbacks. Import order
  is enforced by isort (black profile) via pre-commit.

### Docstrings and documentation

Docstrings use the Google format (`Args:`, `Returns:`, `Raises:`, `Attributes:`); mkdocstrings parses them for the
reference site, and lists render correctly only with a blank line before them. Wrap code identifiers in backticks.
State what the code currently does, with the factual guarantees plainly stated (shapes, dtypes, defaults, side
effects such as in-place mutation, raise conditions, lifecycle constraints); keep the register neutral (no
intensifiers, evaluative adjectives, or rhetorical constructions) and do not use em-dashes. Describe behavior in
place rather than by analogy to another method. Cautionary content goes in the description body as plain prose before
`Args:`; `Warns:` is reserved for warnings the function emits at runtime. Control docstrings end with the paper
reference:

```
Reference:

    - "Steering Llama 2 via Contrastive Activation Addition"
      Nina Panickssery, Nick Gabrieli, Julian Schulz, Meg Tong, Evan Hubinger, Alexander Matt Turner
      [https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06681](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06681)
```

A new method also needs its documentation surfaces updated: a reference page
`docs/reference/algorithms/<category>_control/<method>.md` (copy the mkdocstrings block from an existing page), a nav
entry in `docs/.nav.yml`, and a mention in the category's list in `docs/concepts/controls.md`.

### Notebooks

Each method gets a demonstration notebook: `examples/notebooks/algorithms/` for named methods, `generics/` for
config-first controls, `benchmarks/` for use-case studies (run artifacts stay in that subfolder), `recipes/` for
composite workflows. Add an entry to `examples/index.md`. Conventions: imports in a setup cell; explanation lives in
markdown cells rather than code comments; one plot per cell, drawn with `evaluation/utils/viz_utils.py` (call
`apply_plot_style()` first if custom matplotlib is unavoidable); no special characters in axis text; f-strings when
titles reference variable values. Markdown prose is plain technical reporting: narrate with "we", keep the register
neutral, signpost with connectives ("Note that ...", "For instance, ..."), write paragraphs rather than bolded bullet
lists, and link the paper in the introduction when demonstrating a published method.

### Definition of done

Before significant changes, check: does this fit the existing abstractions and patterns; does documentation need
updating; does it affect other parts of the system. A finished method contribution includes:

- [ ] the `args.py` / `control.py` / `__init__.py` triplet, importing cleanly with a valid `STEERING_METHOD` export
- [ ] honest `supports_batching`, `RUNTIME_KWARGS_SCHEMA`, and (output) `include_in_scoring` / `same_model_forwards`
- [ ] tests in `tests/controls/test_<method>.py` passing on CPU with the CI models
- [ ] a Google-style docstring ending with the paper reference
- [ ] reference page, `docs/.nav.yml` entry, and `docs/concepts/controls.md` mention
- [ ] a notebook plus its `examples/index.md` entry
- [ ] a `pyproject.toml` extra and `optional.py` entry for any new heavy dependency
- [ ] `pre-commit run --all-files` clean; commits signed off

## Invariants

Rules that hold regardless of task:

1. `steer()` must run before `generate()` or `compute_logprobs()`; it runs once per pipeline and heavy work belongs
   there, not in control constructors.
2. Steering order is fixed (structural, input, state, output); list order within a category is the composition order.
3. The decode loop does not compose; at most one enabled `DecodingDriver` exists per pipeline, and a driver must
   apply the received `logits_processors` and `stopping_criteria` at every scoring step of every forward pass it
   issues.
4. Logits processors behave as functions of `(prefix_ids, scores)`; internal state is permitted only as memoization
   keyed on the prefix (subclass `PrefixKeyedProcessor`), and `get_logits_processors` returns fresh instances per
   call.
5. Extra forward passes through the pipeline's own model during decoding are wrapped in `auxiliary_pass()` (from
   `core/utils/auxiliary_pass.py`), and the component declares `same_model_forwards = True`.
6. State hooks live only inside the pipeline-managed context; do not register hooks outside the
   `get_hooks`/`register_hooks` flow, and rely on the base class for cleanup.
7. Never mutate caller-supplied artifacts (steering vectors, probes, configs); clone before moving devices or
   normalizing.
8. Controls hold per-generation state on `self`; one in-flight generation per control instance, so do not share
   instances across concurrently running pipelines.
9. `generate()` returns continuation-only ids by default; never re-slice its result by prompt length.
10. `runtime_kwargs` is a single shared namespace per call; declare consumed names in `RUNTIME_KWARGS_SCHEMA` and
    expect shared values on name collisions.
11. Declare `supports_batching=True` only when a control is safe under batched prompts; the pipeline and the
    evaluation utilities read it to choose between batched and per-example generation.
