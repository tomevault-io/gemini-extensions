# AGENTS.md

Root coordination contract for AI and human contributors in this repo. Detailed architecture and working guidelines live in [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md); this file states the non-negotiables and where to look.

## Scope

- Applies to the whole monorepo: `frontend/`, `backend/`, `mobile/`, `website/`, `shared/`, `contracts/ethereum/`, `contracts/solana/`, `services/indexer-go/`, `proto/`, `services/image-generator/`.
- No nested `AGENTS.md` files exist yet. If one is added under a package, it may tighten rules for that subtree but must not relax the rules here.

Normative language: `MUST`/`MUST NOT` are mandatory. `SHOULD`/`SHOULD NOT` are expected by default; deviations should be explained in the PR. `MAY` is optional.

## Non-Negotiables

- `MUST NOT` change Solana's frozen combat port (`game/battle_sim.rs`, `game/xp.rs`). It has no caller left in the program, but its golden-vector tests are what still prove `contracts/test-vectors/{battle,xp}.json` describe what actually settled on that chain. A bug found there is fixed forward in the live ports below, under a new `rulesetVersion`, never by patching the frozen one. **The Solidity port is gone**: `CombatSim.sol` was deleted once it had no on-chain caller, which also removed `battle.json`'s Solidity generator and validator. `battle.json` itself is unchanged and still gates the live ports.
- `MUST` keep the two **live** combat ports in step with each other and with the golden vectors: `protocol/src/combat/` (the canonical engine, re-exported from `shared/src/utils/combat` for existing importers) and `services/indexer-go/internal/combat/` (the independent verifier). Changing one without the other re-breaks the circuit breaker in §F, whose whole value is that the two were written to disagree if either drifts. This covers XP and level progression too (`protocol/src/combat/xp.ts`, validated against `contracts/test-vectors/xp.json`), so an XP or decay change is a both-ports change. `services/indexer-go/internal/combat/xp.go` still covers the formula and the decay but not level-up. It also covers **equipment modifiers** (roadmap §4): `protocol/src/combat/equipment.ts` and `services/indexer-go/internal/combat/equipment.go`, both validated against `contracts/test-vectors/equipment.json`. The modifiers apply at one specific point — after `extract`, before the skill multipliers — and moving that point in one port without the other changes every geared fight, so the ordering is pinned by a vector case in both.
- `MUST NOT` edit `contracts/test-vectors/{battle,xp,equipment}.json` to make a failing test pass — this holds more strongly now, not less. `battle.json` and `xp.json` are the only mechanical link left between the frozen ports and the live ones, and a live port that fails them has drifted away from the rules real battles were settled under. `equipment.json` is newer and has no frozen witness, but the same rule applies for the same reason: it is what holds the two live ports to one another. Its first case deliberately reproduces a `battle.json` row, so an ungeared fight is proven unchanged rather than assumed.
- `MUST` treat a `snapshot` or `ruleset` schema-version bump as append-only. An absent version means **1**, never "whatever this build implements": every snapshot and published bundle written before those fields existed is version 1 and has receipts signed over it, so defaulting to the current version silently re-encodes them under a layout they were never hashed under and invalidates every signature. Old versions stay listed in `SUPPORTED_VERSIONS` permanently (`protocol/src/domain/schemaVersions.ts`).
- `MUST NOT` assume the `ChainAdapter` interface (`shared/src/hooks/adapters/`) covers more than pet-action mutations and reads. It is a real, shared interface (`useEvmAdapter`/`useSolanaAdapter` both implement it) and every public pet-action hook consumes it for the mutation, but the low-level chain wiring in `frontend/src/chains/{ethereum,solana}/`, the async breed/mint randomness flows, and the combat simulator remain intentionally separate per chain. `useCreatePet` and `useBreedPets` are only chain-blind on the action: both carry the EVM settle lifecycle inline behind `isEvm` guards. See CLAUDE.md's cross-chain interfaces section for the exact boundary.
- `MUST` match the license of the package being edited when adding new files: `contracts/ethereum`, `contracts/solana`, `services/indexer-go`, `proto`, `protocol`, and `verifier` are MIT; everything else, `services/image-generator` included, is PolyForm Noncommercial 1.0.0 (root `LICENSE`). See the table in `README.md`. `protocol` is MIT on purpose (third parties have to be able to replay signed battle receipts), so it `MUST NOT` import from a PolyForm package; a test in that package enforces it. `verifier` is MIT for the same reason and depends on nothing but `protocol`.
- `MUST NOT` assume the root `pnpm lint` / `pnpm test` cover `image-generator`, and `MUST NOT` verify it with `pnpm --filter image-generator <script>`. It is not a pnpm workspace member, so that command prints `No projects matched the filters` **and exits 0**: it reports success having run nothing. Run its scripts from `services/image-generator/` instead. It keeps its own lockfile, installs with `pnpm install --ignore-workspace`, and is checked by its own CI workflow.
- `MUST NOT` treat the v1 contract gaps documented in `contracts/plan-contract-upgrade.md` (no battle authorization, the `changeDna` cheat, client-supplied Solana starter-pet DNA) as bugs to silently patch. They are the known baseline the v2 rewrite is designed around.
- `MUST` run the smallest scoped lint/test/build command for the package you touched (see Command Baseline below), not a full monorepo run, unless the change is broad.
- `SHOULD NOT` trust `DEVELOPMENT.md`, `contracts/ethereum/README.md`, or the root `eth:deploy` / `eth:vrf:watch` scripts at face value. Several reference commands removed in a past refactor; see CLAUDE.md's Commands section for what is actually current.

## Command Baseline

- Install: `pnpm install` (root), or `pnpm install:all` (root + frontend + website + backend + mobile + contracts/ethereum)
- Dev: `pnpm dev` (backend + frontend + image-generator + indexer-go; no `--kill-others-on-fail`, so an unconfigured optional service dies alone), or `pnpm dev:fe` / `pnpm dev:be` / `pnpm dev:art` / `pnpm dev:idx` / `pnpm dev:mobile` / `pnpm dev:web` individually, or `pnpm fe:eth:local` / `pnpm fe:sol:local` for a full local chain + backend + frontend stack
- Lint: `pnpm lint` (covers frontend, backend, shared, protocol, verifier, website, mobile, contracts/ethereum)
- Test: `pnpm test` (equals `contracts/ethereum` test only; per-package test commands are in CLAUDE.md)
- Build: `pnpm build`

Full per-package lint/test/build matrix and single-test syntax: see [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md#commands).

## Where To Look

- Behavioral guidelines and full architecture: [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md)
- Data flow and component map: [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md#architecture) (there is no `docs/architecture.md`)
- Test suite conventions: [docs/testing.md](./docs/testing.md)
- Backend API surface: [backend/API.md](./backend/API.md)
- Indexer internals: [services/indexer-go/README.md](./services/indexer-go/README.md)
- Contract v1-to-v2 migration plan: [contracts/plan-contract-upgrade.md](./contracts/plan-contract-upgrade.md)
- Contribution workflow: [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md)
- Reporting vulnerabilities: [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md)

## Enforcement

Mechanical checks over prose, where they exist:

- ESLint per package (`frontend`, `shared`, `website`, `mobile`), plus a custom CSS-naming check in `frontend` (`lint:css`). `shared`'s config carries a `no-restricted-imports` boundary: nothing in `@shared/core` may import through a frontend path alias (`@components/*`, `@hooks/*`, …) or a platform-only module (`react-router-dom`, `react-native`, `next/*`), since the package is consumed by both web and React Native.
- Golden test vectors (`contracts/test-vectors/{battle,xp,equipment}.json`), run by Anchor, `indexer-go`'s `combat_golden_test.go` and `equipment_golden_test.go`, and `@cryptopets/protocol`'s `tests/combat/goldenVectors.test.ts` and `equipmentVectors.test.ts` (Vitest), are the cross-language enforcement for combat-simulator parity. `equipment.json` is read by the two live ports only, since the frozen Solana port predates equipment and never applies it. Anchor's frozen suite proves the vectors still describe what really settled on Solana; the two live ports prove they have not drifted from it. Hardhat no longer checks `battle.json` — that leg went with `CombatSim.sol`.
- CI coverage workflow (`.github/workflows/coverage.yml`) runs frontend/backend/shared vitest coverage on every PR and posts a combined comment. The verifier workflow (`.github/workflows/verifier.yml`) replays a committed receipt corpus through the standalone verifier, and asserts a tampered corpus is rejected.
- There is no repo-wide `agents:check` yet, and the module-boundary lint above covers only `shared`'s outbound imports. Nothing checks the reverse direction (an app keeping platform-neutral code to itself), which is what put four hooks and a formatter in `frontend` until they were moved out. Rely on the per-package commands above and the golden vectors until something broader exists.
