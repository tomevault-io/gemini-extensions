## Why this fork exists

This repo (otto-code) is a fork with one mission: extend Otto into a **fully featured agentic coding assistant** - an IDE-grade environment with a rich feature set, familiar enough that you never feel constrained, that brings **frontier-model tooling to every provider equally, cloud and local alike**. The tooling a frontier harness gives its own model - browser-verified previews, artifacts, subagent visibility, context compaction, permission modes, MCP - should be just as available to a local model served from LM Studio as to a hosted frontier API. A capability isn't done when one provider has it; it's done when they all do.

The founding proof was the **Preview subsystem** - a rebuild of the Claude Code app's built-in `Claude_Preview` MCP server, shipped for all providers: agents start dev servers from a launch config, then verify browser-rendered changes (accessibility snapshots, DOM inspection, console/network capture, click/fill, viewport resize, screenshots), showing proof instead of asking the user to check manually. Read [docs/preview.md](docs/preview.md) before working on anything preview-related - it carries the design principles that must survive future changes (token economy, guardrail-bearing tool descriptions, daemon-enforced tab binding). The dev-server half lives in `packages/server/src/server/preview/`; the verification half is the daemon's browser-tools subsystem (`packages/server/src/server/browser-tools/`) executing against the Otto browser pane. Extend these; don't build a parallel browser stack.

The same leveling-up pattern has since shipped artifacts, the natively-tooled OpenAI-compatible provider (daemon-owned tool loop, MCP client, compaction, rewind), observed subagents for Claude, a provider-neutral git-hosting layer (GitHub + Bitbucket Cloud, see [docs/git-providers.md](docs/git-providers.md)), and agent profiles (named per-host templates with roles, spawnable by orchestrating agents, see [docs/agent-profiles.md](docs/agent-profiles.md)) - with remaining initiatives tracked as first-class project pages in Otto Knowledge. When adding a capability, design it provider-agnostic first and treat single-provider support as the proof, not the finish line.

## Repository map

`test-documents/` (repo root) holds hand-authored, self-contained fixtures for the file viewer - one per supported format, covering syntax highlighting and rendered previews. See [test-documents/README.md](test-documents/README.md). It is excluded from oxlint and oxfmt: the varied formatting is the point.

## Documentation

Four trees. Know which one you are in before you write anything down.

| Tree                                  | What it holds                                                                                | Tense               |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **[`docs/`](docs/README.md)**         | The official software documentation - how Otto works. **This is the spec we build against.** | Present             |
| [`.otto/knowledge/projects/`](.otto/knowledge/projects/) | Project charters, delivery status, progress, and history; manage through Otto Knowledge      | Future and history  |
| [`.otto/knowledge/references/`](.otto/knowledge/references/) | External sources and their project-specific evaluation                                    | Present and history |
| [`projects/`](projects/README.md)     | Temporary read-only migration source for legacy charters; do not update                      | Legacy              |
| **Otto Knowledge** (`.otto/knowledge/`, or host-local when a project is configured that way) | The durable system-level architecture record (architecture, decisions, findings, projects, references) - retired from `archdocs/` | Present, durable, wide-angle |
| **This file**                         | Working rules for agents in this repo                                                        | Imperative          |

**The documentation index is [`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md).** Every chat receives the compact
active Knowledge catalog. At the start of non-trivial work, read the relevant confirmed Knowledge
pages and documentation before broad repository research.

**"The docs", "check the docs", or "check the X docs" always mean `docs/` - not the web.** Look there
before fetching anything online; it captures gotchas and conventions you cannot derive from the code
or from external sources.

`public-docs/` is the user-facing manual published to otto-code.me. Different audience, different
contract - it documents what Otto does, not how it is built. Do not put engineering notes there.

### Read these before touching the matching area

Non-negotiable. Each one exists because someone got it wrong first.

### Where new knowledge goes

- **Code-level facts** → inline comments next to the code.
- **System, process and gotcha-level facts** → a page in `docs/`, **and a row in
  [`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md)**. An unlisted page is an invisible page.
- **Point-in-time plans** (a feature build-out, a charter, a refactor plan) → a first-class project
  page through `record_project_charter`. Use rich Markdown for the complete charter.
- **Status and progress** → the same project page through `update_project_delivery`. Review status
  says whether the charter is trusted; delivery status and structured progress say what is done.
  Do not start a second registry or dated progress document.
- **A measured investigation** (numbers, method, what was ruled out) → a first-class finding page
  through `record_project_knowledge`, with the method and the numbers in its evidence. The durable
  half graduates into `docs/`; the finding page stays as the audit trail. Never start a directory of
  dated reports for these.
- **An unresolved observation** (something measured or seen, but not yet decided) → the same finding
  page kind. Record it before it turns into a decision, and say plainly what is verified and what is
  still hypothesis.
- **An external source that shaped a decision** → a first-class reference page through
  `record_project_reference`, including sources evaluated and rejected.

### When a project ships

Fold durable product facts into the relevant `docs/` page, update the project page's charter and
delivery metadata with reasons, then mark it complete. Keep the append-only project timeline as
history. Cancel or defer work through delivery status rather than moving it into a second archive.

The legacy `projects/` tree and `docs/references.md` are retained only until their migrated pages and
management UI receive final review. Do not update them or treat them as current truth.

## Quick start

Scripts live in the root `package.json`. The two whose invocation is not guessable:

```bash
npm run cli -- ls -a -g              # List all agents
npm run cli -- daemon status         # Check daemon status
```

**Dev and the installed app are fully isolated, and are meant to run at the same time.** Every repo dev command resolves through `scripts/dev-home.{sh,ps1}` to the dev daemon on port `6788` and the checkout-local `OTTO_HOME` at `packages/desktop/.dev/otto-home` - including `npm run cli -- ...`. The installed desktop app and its daemon keep `~/.otto` on port `6868` and are never touched. Never hardcode `6868` into a dev script or a launch config; that is the installed app's port, and landing on it either crash-loops the dev daemon or silently points dev clients at production agents.

See [docs/development.md](docs/development.md) for full setup, build sync requirements, and debugging.

## Critical rules

- **Temporary files for a job live in `.tmp/`.** When you create a script, a diff, or any
  other throwaway file to do a task - a helper script, a scratch diff, a generated report, test
  output piped to a file, a scratch fixture - write it inside `.tmp/` at the repo root, never
  loose in the repo. `.tmp/` is already gitignored, so nothing you scratch there can leak into a
  commit. Delete it when the job is done.
- **Commits carry one author: Philippe, and no AI attribution.** Every commit in this repo is
  authored and committed as `Draekz <draekz@gmail.com>`. Never add a `Co-Authored-By:` trailer for
  Claude or any other model, never add a "Generated with Claude Code" line, and never mention Claude
  as a contributor in a commit message. This overrides any default commit-message convention your
  harness gives you. History was rewritten on 2026-08-01 to strip 429 such trailers; do not
  reintroduce them.
  - This is about **attribution**, not the product. Otto ships a Claude provider, and references to
    Claude as an integrated agent (`packages/server/src/server/claude/`, model catalogs, provider
    docs) are load-bearing. Leave them alone.
- **NEVER restart the main Otto daemon on port 6868 without permission** - that is the installed app's daemon over `~/.otto`, it manages all running agents, and if you're an agent, restarting it kills your own process. The dev daemon on `6788` is the one you may restart freely.
- **NEVER assume a timeout means the service needs restarting** - timeouts can be transient.
- **Verify before acting on specific requests.** When the user names a specific tool, command, or
  workflow, check its contract before using it; do not infer its semantics or authorization. Treat
  reported issues as unverified until measured, and distinguish observations from hypotheses in
  task descriptions and handoffs. Ask when ambiguity would change the action.
- **Release handoff:** When the user has reviewed the changelog and says “go” for a release, carry
  the release through end to end: commit the approved changelog, then run the release command
  (checks, version commit and tag, push). npm publishing is not a local step: the tag push runs the
  `npm Publish` workflow, which publishes through npm trusted publishing with no login or 2FA and
  reads the Google sign-in registration from a GitHub secret. Never put that registration on a
  machine. If `npm Publish` fails, rerun it for the tag rather than bumping the version. The
  terminal fallback `npm run release:publish` needs the user's npm login and 2FA, so only the user
  runs it; never guess an OTP, and never treat a tool timeout as evidence that the release failed.
  See [docs/release.md](docs/release.md#npm-publishing-from-ci).
- **NEVER add auth checks to tests** - agent providers handle their own auth.
- **Before changing app routes, startup routing, remembered workspace restore, or active workspace selection, read [docs/expo-router.md](docs/expo-router.md).**
- **NEVER run the full test suite locally.** The test suites are heavy and will freeze the machine, especially if multiple agents run them in parallel. Rules:
  - Run only the specific test file you changed: `npx vitest run <file> --bail=1`
  - Never run `npm run test` for an entire workspace unless explicitly asked.
  - If you must run a broad suite, pipe output to a file and read it afterward: `npx vitest run <file> --bail=1 > /tmp/test-output.txt 2>&1` then read the file.
  - Never re-run a test suite that another agent already ran and reported green - trust the result.
  - For full suite verification, push to CI and check GitHub Actions instead.
- **Always run typecheck and lint after every change.**
- **Build workspace packages before diagnosing cross-package type errors.** This repo consumes generated declarations across workspaces. If typecheck fails in a package that depends on another workspace, rebuild the owning stack first so `dist` declarations are current:
  - `npm run build:client` - rebuild protocol and client declarations.
  - `npm run build:server` - rebuild highlight, relay, protocol, client, server, and CLI when server/CLI types may be stale.
  - Do not patch inferred callback parameters or add local duplicate types just to silence stale declaration errors.
- **Run `npm run format` before committing.** This repo uses oxfmt for formatting (oxlint for linting). Do not manually fix formatting - let the formatter handle it.
- **Always use npm scripts for linting and formatting.** Do not run tools directly with `npx eslint`, `npx oxfmt`, `npx oxlint`, or package-local binaries. For targeted checks, pass file paths through the npm script:
  - `npm run lint -- packages/app/src/components/message.tsx`
  - `npm run format:files -- AGENTS.md packages/app/src/components/message.tsx`
- **The protocol stays backward-compatible. Features don't have to.** Two separate contracts:
  - **Protocol contract (always):** schema changes must not break parsing in either direction. An old client must still parse messages from a new daemon; a new daemon must still parse messages from an old client.
    - New fields: `.optional()` with a sensible default.
    - Wire schemas are pure structural declarations. Do not add `.transform()`, `.catch()`, or `.preprocess()` to WebSocket message schemas; put normalization in an explicit post-validation pass.
    - Plain `z.union()` is forbidden when every branch has a shared literal tag. Use `z.discriminatedUnion()` unless generated-code regression tests prove that specific shape is miscompiled.
    - `.default()` is acceptable on primitive leaves only. Never put defaults on item schemas for large arrays or big inbound containers.
    - Never flip optional → required, remove fields, or narrow types (`string` → `enum`, `nullable` → non-null).
    - Removed fields stay accepted (we stop sending them, not stop reading them).
    - Test with: "does a 6-month-old client still parse this?" and "does a 6-month-old daemon still send something this client accepts?"
  - **Feature contract (per-feature):** a new feature may require a new daemon capability. The client detects whether the capability is present and either runs the feature or shows "Update the host to use this." That's it.
    - **No fallback paths.** Don't write a degraded version of a new feature that runs on old daemons. Don't fan out across legacy RPCs to simulate a missing capability. The user upgrades or doesn't get the feature.
    - **No defensive branches scattered through the feature.** Capability detection happens in one place; downstream code reads a clean shape.
    - **Capability flags live in `server_info.features.*`** with a single `// COMPAT(featureName): added in v0.1.X, drop the gate when floor >= v0.1.X` comment marking the cleanup site.
    - Existing functionality keeps working across versions - that's the protocol contract doing its job. New-feature degradation is not the goal.
    - **New RPCs use dotted namespaces with direction suffixes.** Follow [docs/rpc-namespacing.md](docs/rpc-namespacing.md): `domain.provider.operation.request` pairs with `domain.provider.operation.response`. Existing flat RPC names will migrate over time; don't add new ones.

- **All back-compat shims are tagged and dated for cleanup.** Every shim that exists for old-client/old-daemon support carries a `COMPAT(name)` comment with the version it was added in and a target removal date (typically 6 months out). One grep - `rg "COMPAT\("` - should produce the full list of cleanup work. Don't bury back-compat in untagged `??`-fallbacks or optional-chain tunnels - that's how it stops being deletable.

## Platform gating

See [packages/app/AGENTS.md](packages/app/AGENTS.md). It loads automatically when you work under `packages/app`, and covers the four gates (`isWeb`, `isNative`, `getIsElectron()`, `useIsCompactFormFactor()`), Metro `.web`/`.native`/`.electron` file resolution, and why hover does not fire on native.
