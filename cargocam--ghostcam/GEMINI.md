## ghostcam

> This repo contains the open-source camera-side stack for [Ghostcam](https://ghostcam.fly.dev): a Go daemon that runs on a Raspberry Pi, the shared wire-contract types it uses to talk to a server, and the Debian / image-build glue that produces installable artefacts. The daemon captures H.264 + Opus via `rpicam-vid | ffmpeg`, uploads fMP4 HLS segments to S3 via server-presigned URLs, publishes live A/V via WHIP/WebRTC, and POSTs telemetry every 10 s. There's no server in this repo — the camera talks to one over HTTPS using the contract documented in `common/`.

# CLAUDE.md — Ghostcam Camera Development Guide

## What is this project?

This repo contains the open-source camera-side stack for [Ghostcam](https://ghostcam.fly.dev): a Go daemon that runs on a Raspberry Pi, the shared wire-contract types it uses to talk to a server, and the Debian / image-build glue that produces installable artefacts. The daemon captures H.264 + Opus via `rpicam-vid | ffmpeg`, uploads fMP4 HLS segments to S3 via server-presigned URLs, publishes live A/V via WHIP/WebRTC, and POSTs telemetry every 10 s. There's no server in this repo — the camera talks to one over HTTPS using the contract documented in `common/`.

The camera was Python from 2026-05-12 to 2026-05-14 (the `go-camera-rewrite` cutover). The Python port unblocked iteration on telemetry/upload/motion code but the live-relay slice (NAL framing + WebSocket transport) wanted to stay in Go, and once WHIP/pion was the chosen live wire format, Python was no longer earning its keep.

## Documentation Policy

When making changes to the codebase, **always update the relevant README and CLAUDE.md** to reflect those changes.

## Build & Run

```bash
# Production binary (Pi target)
CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm64 \
  go build -trimpath -ldflags="-s -w" -o ghostcam-camera ./camera

# Synthetic / dev (host-arch, no real sensors)
go build -tags synthetic -o ghostcam-camera-synthetic ./camera

# Tests
go test ./...
```

`-trimpath` + `-ldflags="-s -w"` is the same flag set release.yml uses; CI's reproducible-build gate asserts these produce byte-identical output across two consecutive builds. Adding non-deterministic state to the daemon (e.g., capturing a build timestamp via `init()`) will break that gate.

### Build tags

Two camera-side build tags select compile-time variants:

- `linux && !synthetic` — production. Real sensors (`sensors_linux.go`), real network (`network_linux.go`), real QR scan via `rpicam-still` (`qr_linux.go`), real Bluetooth peripheral (`bt_onboarding_linux.go`).
- Anything else (including `linux` with `-tags synthetic`) — synthetic. Test source via ffmpeg's `testsrc2` + `sine`, stub network, no QR, no BT.

The pattern across `camera/sensors_*.go`, `camera/network_*.go`, `camera/qr_*.go`, `camera/bt_onboarding_*.go`, `camera/battery_pisugar_*.go` is: one `_linux.go` file with the real impl behind `//go:build linux && !synthetic`, one `_other.go` with a no-op stub behind `//go:build !linux || synthetic`.

## Release flow

`release.yml` fires on every push to `main`:

1. Computes the next version: highest existing bare-semver tag (`vX.Y.Z`) + patch bump. No existing tag → seeds at `v0.1.0`.
2. Cross-compiles the camera binary for `linux/arm64` with `-X main.Version=$NEXT` (e.g. `v0.1.8`).
3. Generates a CycloneDX SBOM via `cyclonedx-gomod app`.
4. Packages the binary into a `.deb` named `ghostcam-camera_arm64.deb` with `Version: 0.1.8` (bare semver, no tilde/build-metadata suffix).
5. Tags HEAD with `$NEXT` (no force-move) and creates a fresh GitHub release with the .deb, SBOM, raw binary, and checksums.
6. The downstream server has a `release.published` webhook that reads the tag name directly from the event payload; cameras pull updates via that server's `/api/v1/firmware/latest` endpoint.

**Manual minor/major bumps**: operator runs locally `git tag v0.2.0 <sha> && git push --tags`, then the next push to main picks `v0.2.1`. There's no commit-message parsing; deliberate bumps go through git.

`pi-images.yml` is **manual** — `workflow_dispatch` triggered by an operator who passes a release tag. Builds `.img.xz` via rpi-image-gen for the requested device profiles (currently `zero2w`).

`rpi-image-gen.yml` builds the rpi-image-gen container image (used by pi-images.yml). Runs on the 1st of each month or manual dispatch.

## How the camera knows where to send data

1. **Operator-provided env**: `GHOSTCAM_SERVER_URL` in `/etc/ghostcam/env` (or `/etc/ghostcam/env.d/*.conf`). Set once by `pi-setup.sh`.
2. **Provisioning payload**: when the daemon has no `server_url` file, it enters provisioning mode and accepts a `QRPayload` (containing `server` + `token`) via either a QR code scanned by `rpicam-still` or a BT-GATT write to the advertised `Ghostcam-<id>` service. The payload also carries optional `wifi_ssid`/`wifi_password` for cellular-only cameras that want to drop onto WiFi at install time.

Once provisioned, the daemon signs every authenticated request with the ed25519 key at `/var/ghostcam/identity_key`. `device_id` is deterministic: SHA-256 of the public key, first 16 bytes hex. So a re-provisioned camera shows up as the same device on the same server.

## Code Conventions

### Go

- `log/slog` for structured logging. Use `slog.Info` / `slog.Warn` / `slog.Error` with key-value attrs, not `Printf`. Examples: `slog.Info("rpicam-vid started", "pid", cmd.Process.Pid)`.
- Wrap errors via `fmt.Errorf("context: %w", err)`. The `%w` is load-bearing — many places use `errors.Is` / `errors.As` on the chain.
- `sync/atomic` for single-value cross-goroutine flags (e.g., `manualPowerMode`, `currentPowerMode`).
- Channels for goroutine-to-goroutine messaging that needs backpressure (`segmentCh`, `requestPipelineRestart`).
- Comments explain *why*, not *what*. Especially load-bearing: rollback gating logic, polkit/netdev hacks, the .deb Version `+sha` trick.

## Dependencies

External Go deps the camera relies on:

- `github.com/pion/webrtc/v4`, `pion/rtp`, `pion/rtcp` — WHIP publisher.
- `tinygo.org/x/bluetooth` — BLE GATT peripheral on Linux (uses BlueZ over D-Bus).
- `github.com/godbus/dbus/v5` — direct BlueZ D-Bus calls the tinygo API doesn't expose (powering on `hci0` before advertising, reading advertising-manager state for onboarding diagnostics).
- `github.com/makiuchi-d/gozxing` — QR decode (synthetic mode uses this; real mode currently relies on libzbar via rpicam-still glue but gozxing is the planned migration).
- `github.com/BurntSushi/toml` — config parsing.
- `github.com/google/uuid` — segment IDs.
- Standard library for everything else (HTTP, ed25519, JSON, slog).

Pi-side runtime deps (declared in the `.deb`'s `Depends:`):

- `ffmpeg`, `rpicam-apps`, `alsa-utils` (capture)
- `network-manager`, `wpasupplicant`, `modemmanager`, `libqmi-utils`, `usb-modeswitch` (connectivity)
- `gpsd`, `gpsd-clients` (GPS)
- `bluez`, `rfkill` (Bluetooth)
- `libzbar0`, `ca-certificates`, `adduser`, `init-system-helpers` (misc)

## Common debugging entry points

- **Service status on Pi**: `systemctl status ghostcam-camera`, `journalctl -u ghostcam-camera -f`.
- **Identity check**: `/var/ghostcam/identity_key` (private, mode 0600), `/var/ghostcam/identity_key.pub` (hex, mode 0644). Device ID = `sha256(identity_key.pub_bytes)[:16]` in hex.
- **What's the running version**: `dpkg-query -W -f='${Version}\n' ghostcam-camera` for the apt-level version, or `journalctl -u ghostcam-camera | grep 'camera identity'` for the daemon's own `main.Version` baked at build time.
- **WHIP not connecting**: check `journalctl -u ghostcam-camera | grep -iE "WHIP|publisher|state"`. Common causes: server URL unreachable, ed25519 signature mismatch (regenerated identity), or the WHIP endpoint returned 4xx.
- **BT onboarding: Pi doesn't show up as an available device**: the daemon only advertises the `Ghostcam-<id>` GATT peripheral while in provisioning mode (no `server_url`/token yet). It powers on the BlueZ controller itself before advertising — `ScanBT` sets `org.bluez.Adapter1.Powered=true` on `hci0` over D-Bus, because `rfkill unblock` alone leaves the controller un-powered and tinygo's `Advertisement.Start()` doesn't check/power it (unlike Scan/Connect). Check `journalctl -u ghostcam-camera | grep -iE "BT|adapter|advertis"` and `bluetoothctl show` (look for `Powered: yes`). `ghostcam` must be in the `bluetooth` group (deb postinst handles this) for the D-Bus power-on to be permitted.
- **Segment uploads stuck**: `ls -la /var/ghostcam/segments/` and `journalctl -u ghostcam-camera | grep -iE "presign|upload"`. The daemon writes segments to disk first, then uploads asynchronously — if disk fills up, the OS evicts old segments first.

If a Pi is offline after a routine WPA rekey, the fix landed in 2026-05-17: `connection.autoconnect-retries=0` on every NM connection. Old `.deb`s without this are vulnerable; apt-upgrade to the latest first if you suspect a stuck wifi state.
