# LiveTemplate - Development Guidelines

## Project Overview

LiveTemplate is a high-performance Go library for building reactive web applications. It provides an API similar to `html/template` but with the additional capability of generating minimal, tree-based updates that can be efficiently transmitted to clients.

**Related repositories:**
- **CLI Tool (lvt)**: Code generator and development server — maintained at `github.com/livetemplate/lvt`
- **TypeScript Client**: Browser-side update handler — maintained at `github.com/livetemplate/client`

## Controller+State Pattern

Controllers hold dependencies (singleton, never cloned). State holds pure data (cloned per session). Action methods: `func (c *Controller) Action(state State, ctx *Context) (State, error)`. Mount runs on every HTTP request and WebSocket connect.

**Key caveats:**
- **Mount() guard pattern:** Mount runs on POST too, so guard side effects with the connect-kind helpers: `if ctx.IsInitialMount() { trackPageView() }` (initial HTTP GET only) or `if ctx.IsReconnect() { ... }` (WS reconnect with restored state). The older `if ctx.Action() == ""` idiom still works but conflates GETs with WS connects/reconnects and internal navigate POSTs.
- **BroadcastAction ordering:** `ctx.With*()` creates shallow copies. Call `ctx.BroadcastAction()` AFTER all `With*()` calls, or broadcasts queued before the copy won't propagate.
- **AssertPureState[T]():** Use in tests to catch dependency types accidentally in state structs.

See `docs/references/controller-pattern.md` for the full pattern guide with examples.

## Progressive Complexity

Standard HTML (forms, buttons, dialogs) handles Tier 1. `lvt-*` attributes (`lvt-on:`, `lvt-el:`, `lvt-fx:`, `lvt-mod:`, `lvt-form:`, `lvt-nav:`) are reserved for Tier 2 behaviors HTML cannot express.

See `docs/guides/progressive-complexity.md` for the full walkthrough.

## Architecture

5 operational phases: **Parse -> Build -> Diff -> Render -> Send**, each in `internal/{phase}/`. Supporting packages: `internal/keys/`, `internal/session/`, `internal/observe/`, `internal/upload/`, `internal/fuzz/`.

See `docs/design/ARCHITECTURE.md` for design decisions and `docs/design/CODE_STRUCTURE.md` for the complete file-by-file map.

## Key Data Structures

### TreeNode
```go
type TreeNode struct {
    Statics     []string                // Static HTML parts (key: "s")
    Dynamics    []interface{}           // Dynamic content indexed by position (keys: "0", "1", etc.)
    AutoKey     string                  // Range item key, replaces previous "_k" map key
    Fingerprint string                  // Structure hash (key: "f")
    Range       *RangeData              // Range operation data (key: "d")
    Metadata    *TreeMetadata           // Additional metadata (key: "m")
}
```
- Core structure for representing static/dynamic content
- Custom JSON marshaling maintains wire format compatibility (numeric keys for dynamics)
- Can be nested for complex templates

### Key Constructs
- `FieldConstruct`: Simple field replacement `{{.Field}}`
- `ConditionalConstruct`: If/else branches `{{if .Cond}}...{{else}}...{{end}}`
- `RangeConstruct`: Iteration `{{range .Items}}...{{end}}`
- `WithConstruct`: Context switching `{{with .Item}}...{{end}}`
- `TemplateInvokeConstruct`: Template invocation `{{template "name" .}}`

## Testing Strategy

### Test Files Structure
- `template_test.go`: Core template functionality tests (includes key injection tests)
- `tree_test.go`: Tree structure invariant validation
- `e2e_update_spec_test.go`: Tree update specification compliance tests
- Internal package tests: `internal/*/`

**Browser-based E2E Tests:**
Browser-based chromedp E2E tests are maintained in the lvt repository:
- Location: `github.com/livetemplate/lvt/e2e/livetemplate_core_test.go`
- These tests validate the library from a black-box perspective using real browser automation
- Tests include: complete rendering sequences, loading indicators, focus preservation, etc.

### Test Data
- `testdata/fixtures/`: Template fixtures for unit tests
- `testdata/golden/`: Golden files for snapshot testing
- `testdata/fuzz/`: Fuzz test corpus

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
go test -v ./...

# Run specific test categories
go test -run TestTemplate -v          # Template engine tests
go test -run TestTreeInvariant -v     # Tree invariant tests
go test -run TestKeyInjection -v      # Key injection tests
go test -run TestE2EUpdateSpec -v     # Update spec compliance tests

# Run with timeout
go test -v ./... -timeout=30s
```

## Development Conventions

### Release Process
- **Never create git tags manually** - Always use `release.sh` script for releases

### Code Style
1. **No unnecessary comments** - Code should be self-documenting
2. **Follow existing patterns** - Check neighboring code for conventions
3. **Use existing utilities** - Don't reinvent the wheel
4. **Maintain idiomatic Go** - Follow Go best practices

### Template Processing Flow
1. **Parse**: Template string -> Compiled template structure
2. **Execute**: First render generates initial tree with statics and dynamics
3. **Update**: Subsequent renders generate minimal update trees
4. **Diff**: Compare trees to produce update operations

### Key Generation Strategy
- Uses wrapper-based approach with sequential key generation
- Keys are stable within a single render
- Supports any data type without special handling
- Keys reset between renders for consistency

### Best Practices: `data-key` Attributes in Range Templates

When rendering lists with `{{range}}`, the diff engine needs stable keys to track items across renders. By default, LiveTemplate auto-generates hash-based keys from item content. Explicit `data-key` attributes give you control:

```html
{{range .Items}}
<div data-key="{{.ID}}">{{.Name}}</div>
{{end}}
```

**When to use explicit `data-key`:**
- Items have a natural unique identifier (database ID, UUID)
- List items are reordered frequently (drag-and-drop, sorting)
- Items may have identical content but different identity

**When auto-generated keys suffice:**
- Small static lists (<100 items) with no reordering
- Items are always appended/removed, never reordered
- Content is unique across all items

**Key stability matters for performance:** Stable keys enable the diff engine to emit minimal `["u", key, changes]` operations instead of removing and re-inserting items. Unstable keys (e.g., using array index) cause unnecessary DOM thrashing on the client.

## Important Implementation Details

### Wire Format Optimization
The library implements a critical optimization per the tree-update-specification.md:
- **First Render**: Tree includes complete static structure (`"s"` arrays) + all dynamics
- **Updates**: Tree includes ONLY changed dynamics, NO statics (client has them cached)

This is implemented by `PrepareTreeForClient(node, clientHasStatics)` which:
1. Takes a fully-built tree (WITH statics, needed for comparison consistency)
2. Returns a wire-format tree (WITHOUT statics if client has cached them)
3. Implements spec requirement: "Updates MUST include ONLY changed dynamics"

**Key Architectural Points**:
- Trees are ALWAYS generated WITH statics (ensures consistent comparison)
- Comparison logic (`compareTreesAndGetChanges`) determines what changed
- `PrepareTreeForClient` removes statics before wire transmission
- This is NOT a "reactive fix" - it's the correct implementation of specification
- Result: Updates are ~10% the size of full renders (statics are largest part)

### Fingerprint-Based Structure Comparison

The system uses FNV-1a structure fingerprints to decide whether statics need to be resent. This replaced an earlier per-path `ClientStructureRegistry` approach (removed in [PR #86](https://github.com/livetemplate/livetemplate/pull/86)) that was more complex and harder to debug.

**What gets fingerprinted** (`internal/build/fingerprint.go`):
- Statics arrays (the HTML template parts between dynamic slots)
- Dynamic key positions (e.g., "there's a dynamic at position 0, 1, 2")
- Nested TreeNode structure (recursively)
- Range statics (item template structure)
- NOT dynamic values — two trees with identical structure but different content produce the same fingerprint

**Decision flow** (`internal/diff/tree_compare.go`):
```go
func ClientNeedsStatics(oldTree, newTree *TreeNode) bool {
    // First render: no previous tree -> must send statics
    if oldTree == nil { return true }
    // Removal: new tree is gone -> no statics needed
    if newTree == nil { return false }
    // Compare structure fingerprints for non-nil trees
    oldFP := oldTree.GetStructureFingerprint()
    newFP := newTree.GetStructureFingerprint()
    // Same fingerprint -> client has statics cached -> send dynamics only
    // Different fingerprint -> structure changed -> send full tree with statics
    return oldFP != newFP
}
```

The lazy-cached fingerprint enables O(1) structure comparison, avoiding re-computation on subsequent comparisons.

**Key functions**:
- `CalculateStructureFingerprint(tree)` — Computes FNV-1a 128-bit truncated to 64 bits (16 hex chars) of static structure (`internal/build/fingerprint.go`)
- `TreeNode.GetStructureFingerprint()` — Lazy-computes and caches fingerprint on first access (`internal/build/types.go`)
- `ClientNeedsStatics(oldTree, newTree)` — Returns true if fingerprints differ (`internal/diff/tree_compare.go`)
- `PrepareTreeForClient(tree, clientHasStatics)` — Strips statics from wire format when cached (`internal/diff/prepare.go`)

### Wrapper ID Injection
- All templates get a wrapper div with unique ID (`lvt-[random]`)
- Full HTML documents: Wrapper injected around body content
- Fragments: Entire content wrapped
- Used for targeting updates on client side

### Tree Update Format
```json
{
  "s": ["<div>", "</div>"],     // Static parts (cached client-side)
  "0": "Dynamic content",        // Dynamic value at position 0
  "1": {                         // Nested tree for complex structures
    "s": ["<span>", "</span>"],
    "0": "Nested dynamic"
  }
}
```

After first render, client caches the `"s"` arrays. Subsequent updates omit them:
```json
{
  "0": "Updated content"         // Only changed dynamic, no statics
}
```

### Range Operations
For list updates, special operations are used:
- `["u", "item-id", updates]`: Update existing item
- `["i", "after-id", "position", data]`: Insert new item
- `["r", "item-id"]`: Remove item
- `["o", ["id1", "id2", ...]]`: Reorder items

## Pre-commit Hook
The repository has a pre-commit hook that:
1. Auto-formats Go code using `go fmt`
2. Runs `golangci-lint` with `errcheck,govet,ineffassign,staticcheck,unparam,unused`
3. Runs all tests with 300-second timeout
4. Blocks commits if any step fails
5. Automatically stages formatted files

### Linter Set Rationale

The authoritative linter list is `--enable-only=...` in `scripts/pre-commit.sh` — this table is descriptive only and may drift if the script changes without a doc update.

| Linter | Catches |
| --- | --- |
| `errcheck` | Unchecked error returns |
| `govet` | Suspicious constructs — printf formats, struct tags, copy locks |
| `ineffassign` | Ineffective assignments |
| `staticcheck` | SA*/S*/ST* — wide static analysis |
| `unparam` | Unused params, always-constant args, dead returns |
| `unused` | Unused vars, funcs, types, constants |

### `unparam` Scope and Limitations

`unparam` was added to the gate after the cleanup landed in [PR #372](https://github.com/livetemplate/livetemplate/pull/372). It catches a class the other linters miss: **(a)** a param the body never references, **(b)** a param every caller passes the same constant value for, and **(c)** a returned value no caller reads.

**Two limitations to know about:**

1. **No transitive tracing.** A param passed through a chain of walker functions (e.g., `walkAST(keyGen) → walkList(keyGen) → handleRange(keyGen) → …`) counts as "used" at every level even when nothing ultimately invokes anything on it. The streaming-range Phase 8.5 cleanup ([PR #370](https://github.com/livetemplate/livetemplate/pull/370)) removed ~816 lines of exactly this kind of pass-through drift, none of which `unparam` flagged. **Periodic manual audit is still required** for that class — the methodology used in PR #370 (search for transitively-passed params; check what eventually calls anything on them) is the canonical recipe.

2. **The gate is less strict than standalone `unparam -tests ./...`.** golangci-lint v2's default `unparam` config reliably catches always-nil-error returns, always-constant-arg patterns, and unused params on closures bound to typed function aliases — but it skips some pure-unused-param cases on unexported functions that the standalone tool flags. If you suspect drift the gate isn't catching, run `unparam -tests ./...` directly for a stricter pass.

The pre-commit hook prints linter-specific fix guidance for AI assistants when lint fails — see `scripts/pre-commit.sh` for the full block.

## Common Tasks

### Adding New Template Construct
1. Add handling logic in the appropriate `internal/parse/` file (e.g., `field.go`, `conditional.go`, `range.go`, `with.go`)
2. For new construct types, create a new file in `internal/parse/` following existing patterns
3. Add parser logic in `internal/parse/parse.go`
4. Update type definitions in `internal/parse/types.go` if needed
5. Write tests in appropriate test files
6. Ensure backward compatibility if modifying existing constructs

### Debugging Tree Generation
1. Use `TreeNode.GetStructureFingerprint()` to track structural changes
2. Check `lastTree` vs current tree in Template
3. Validate tree structure with `validateTreeStructure()`
4. Use golden files for regression testing

### Updating Client Library
The TypeScript client is maintained in a separate repository at `github.com/livetemplate/client` (locally `../client`).
1. Make changes in the client repository
2. Ensure compatibility with tree format
3. Test with browser test suite
4. Update TypeScript types if needed

## Performance Considerations

1. **Tree Diffing**: O(n) complexity for most operations
2. **Memory**: Trees are kept in memory for diffing
3. **Fingerprinting**: FNV-1a hashing for change detection
4. **Key Generation**: Sequential integers for minimal overhead

## Security Notes

1. **HTML Escaping**: Uses `html/template` for automatic escaping
2. **No Direct HTML**: All content goes through template engine
3. **Wrapper IDs**: Random generation prevents conflicts

## Troubleshooting

### Test Failures
- Check golden files in `testdata/golden/` and `testdata/fixtures/`
- Verify tree structure matches expected format
- Ensure key generation is consistent
- Check for HTML escaping issues
- For browser E2E test failures, see lvt repository

### Tree Generation Issues
- Validate template syntax
- Check construct parsing order
- Verify hydration logic matches compilation
- Test with simpler templates first

### Async WebSocket Issues

**Connection Closes Unexpectedly:**
- Check metrics for `wsSlowClientCloses` counter
- Client may be too slow (buffer full)
- Increase buffer size with `LVT_WS_BUFFER_SIZE` or `WithWebSocketBufferSize()`
- Default buffer: 50 messages

**Goroutine Leaks:**
- Ensure all connections are unregistered via `registry.Unregister(conn)`
- `Unregister()` calls `Close()` which signals writePump to exit
- Check `pumpExited` channel closes (5-second timeout)
- Run tests with `go test -race` to detect race conditions

**High Memory Usage:**
- Each connection: ~980 bytes base + (buffer size x avg message size)
- Default 50-buffer: ~1KB per connection + message overhead
- Reduce buffer size for memory-constrained environments
- Monitor `wsSendBufferSize` gauge metric

**Messages Not Delivered:**
- Check `wsWriteErrors` metric for write failures
- Verify client WebSocket is connected and reading
- Check for `ErrConnectionClosed` or `ErrClientTooSlow` errors
- Review server logs for "WebSocket write failed" warnings

**Performance Tuning:**
- Benchmark results: 165M concurrent sends/sec, 54.7M queued sends/sec
- For high-throughput: Increase buffer size (100-1000)
- For low-latency: Decrease buffer size (10-20)
- Monitor `wsBufferFull` metric to detect backpressure
- Use Prometheus metrics at `/metrics` endpoint for observability

### PubSub / Cross-Instance Broadcasting Issues

**Cross-instance messages not received:**
- Verify `WithPubSubBroadcaster(broadcaster)` is configured
- Check Redis connectivity; all instances must use the same Redis
- Subscriptions are created automatically during WebSocket setup via `DynamicSubscriber` type assertion

**Server hangs at startup (Handle() never returns):**
- `Subscribe()` blocks until Redis confirms the subscription
- If Redis is unreachable and the client has no `DialTimeout`, this blocks indefinitely
- Fix: configure `DialTimeout` on the Redis client (e.g. `&redis.Options{DialTimeout: 5 * time.Second}`)

**Subscriptions lost after Redis reconnection:**
- Should auto-recover: `reconnect()` replays all tracked channels from `subscribedChannels` map
- Check logs for `"Reconnected successfully"` with `dynamic_channels` count
- If `dynamic_channels=0`, no dynamic subscriptions were active

**See also:** [PubSub Reference](docs/references/pubsub.md)

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding more sophisticated diffing algorithms
- Optimize memory usage for large trees
- Add metrics and profiling hooks
- Enhance client-side caching strategies

## AI Code Review Workflow

The Claude review bot runs on every push to open PRs and posts a fresh review as a PR comment. The rules below are distilled from observed patterns across multiple PR review cycles and reviewed by the maintainer before landing — apply them directly when working on PRs.

*Rules 1–3 apply to whoever is driving the PR (human or agent). Rule 4 is a reminder about the review bot's own behavior.*

- **Bot review loop convergence** *(for the PR author)*. The bot re-runs end-to-end on every push, which means review rounds can iterate indefinitely if each round only rewords previous suggestions. **The convergence signal is "successive rounds aren't identifying any new functional issue"** — only style, phrasing, or wording alternatives on content that was already accepted. As a rough heuristic, two consecutive rounds of that shape is usually enough to stop, but the underlying criterion is "no new functional issue," not a fixed count; a single round of clearly-substantive new feedback is not a convergence signal even if surrounded by cosmetic ones. Recognize the pattern and stop pushing; address remaining cosmetic nits by reply rather than by push.

- **Decline with a PR reply, never silently** *(for the PR author)*. When declining a bot suggestion, post a PR comment explaining the rationale with a reference to project guidance (e.g., "don't DRY this 5-line goroutine — duplication teaches the canonical cancellation pattern; see CLAUDE.md 'don't create helpers for one-time operations'"). Silent decline causes the same suggestion to reappear in the next review round under different framing; explicit decline breaks the cycle because the bot reads prior comments before writing its next review.

- **Project guidance trumps bot suggestions when they conflict** *(for the PR author)*. The bot generally favors DRY, explicit constants, and extracted helpers. Project guidance favors pedagogical clarity in examples and minimal abstractions in small helper code. When the two conflict, cite the project rule and decline the bot. **Important: the "decline" examples below apply specifically to examples-repo patterns code — they are NOT license to dismiss DRY or const-declaration suggestions in library (`internal/`, `mount.go`, and other core library) PRs, where the bot's defaults are usually correct.** Common recurring conflicts in examples-repo work:
  - Duplicated goroutine bodies **in patterns examples** are pedagogical, not DRY violations.
  - Small string enums **in a single examples file** (e.g., `Status` with 4 valid values used only in that file) don't need `const` declarations.
  - Inline template comments documenting a deliberate deviation are better than no comment — the comment is the deviation record.

- **Factual claims in docs get bot-verified (with caveats)** *(reminder about the bot's behavior)*. The bot attempts to verify file paths, function names, error strings, call site counts, and `go.mod` versions cited in doc changes — and has caught genuine drift in past reviews. Its verifications are not infallible (it can hallucinate line numbers and occasionally miss a call site), but it is reliable enough that authors should keep assertions precise or phrase them temporally ("as of v0.8.18", "at the time of writing") to avoid drift failures. **Prefer grep anchors over hardcoded line numbers in code references** — grep anchors are self-updating, line numbers silently drift when the file changes.
