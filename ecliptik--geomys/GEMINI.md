# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Geomys is a Gopher browser for classic Macintosh (68000/Macintosh Plus) written in C, targeting System 6.0.8 with MacTCP. Implements RFC 1436 (Gopher) and RFC 4266 (Gopher URI scheme).

## Target Platform Constraints

- Motorola 68000 CPU only (no PowerPC, no 68020+ instructions)
- 4 MiB RAM on Macintosh Plus
- System 6.0.8 primary target
- MacTCP for networking
- Monochrome only for MVP
- Latency and responsiveness are critical priorities

### Multi-Window Memory Constraints (System 7 Color)

On System 7 with Color QuickDraw, a shared 8-bit GWorld offscreen buffer (~300KB at 640x480) is used for flicker-free rendering. Combined with per-page item arrays (298 bytes × item count with Gopher+), memory is the primary constraint for multi-window support:

- **System 6 (monochrome)**: 1-bit offscreen (~22KB). Memory is rarely an issue.
- **System 7 (color)**: 8-bit shared GWorld (~300KB) + per-window item arrays.
- **GopherItem size**: ~298 bytes each (display[100] + selector[128] + host[64] + Gopher+ fields). A large directory (1500+ items) uses ~435KB.
- **Practical window limits**: 2-3 windows with large directories on 4MB. Item array growth (128→256→512→1024→2000) fails silently when heap is exhausted - second/third windows may show fewer items than the first.
- Allocation failures show as "Connection failed" or truncated item lists - the item array `NewPtr` returns NULL and stops adding items at the current capacity boundary (256, 512, 1024).

### Tuning for More Memory

The SIZE resource controls how much memory MultiFinder/System 7 gives Geomys. Default values by preset:

| Preset | Preferred | Minimum | Max Windows |
|--------|-----------|---------|-------------|
| Minimal | 512KB | 256KB | 1 |
| Lite | 1024KB | 768KB | 2 |
| Full | 2560KB | 1536KB | 3 |

On machines with more RAM (8MB, 32MB+), increase the SIZE resource clamp in `scripts/build.sh` (lines 216-221) to give Geomys a larger heap partition:

```bash
# Example: raise full preset to 8MB preferred / 4MB minimum
local max_pref=8192
local max_min=4096
```

Users can also adjust memory after building via Finder's "Get Info" on the Geomys application - change "Application Memory Size" to the desired value. This does not require rebuilding.

## Build System

- Cross-compile on Linux using [Retro68](https://github.com/autc04/Retro68) toolchain
- Toolchain built from source, installed at `Retro68-build/toolchain/` (in-repo, gitignored)
- Source cloned at `Retro68/` (in-repo, gitignored)
- Build: `./scripts/build.sh` (re-use build.sh and release.sh patterns from Flynn)
- CMake flag: `-m68000` for Mac Plus compatibility
- Target artifacts: 800K `.dsk` floppy images and `.hqx` (BinHex) compressed binaries
- Retro68 API quirks vs classic Toolbox: `qd.thePort` not `thePort`, `GetMenuHandle` not `GetMHandle`, `AppendResMenu` not `AddResMenu`, `LMGetApplLimit()` not `GetApplLimit`

### Debug Build Flag

`--debug` enables `GEOMYS_DEBUG` which adds diagnostic info to the status bar (item counts, timing). Example: `./scripts/build.sh --preset minimal --debug`

### Feature Flags

Per-feature CMake options are defined in `CMakeLists.txt` and surfaced via `--flag`/`--no-flag` in `scripts/build.sh`. See `docs/BUILD.md` for the full table. `GEOMYS_UTF8` (auto-detected UTF-8 decoding for directory titles and text content, transcoding to Mac Roman with a CP437 fallback) is ON in full and lite presets, OFF in minimal (mirrors `GEOMYS_CP437`).

### Releases & Artifact Verification

`scripts/release.sh vX.Y.Z` builds all 3 presets (`build.sh --clean --preset {full,lite,minimal}` → 9 artifacts: `.dsk`/`.hqx`/`.sit`) then tries to publish to Forgejo/GitHub; with no `FORGEJO_TOKEN`/`gh auth` it skips publishing and leaves the artifacts in `build/` (ready for Macintosh Garden upload). The build stamps the version only if tag `vX.Y.Z` is at **HEAD** — bump `CMakeLists.txt`, the resource file (`geomys.r` + its `'vers'` resources), and `docs/About Geomys`, finalize CHANGELOG, then commit + tag before building.

Verify artifacts host-side (no Mac): `.dsk` via `hmount` (valid HFS + app); `.hqx` via `hexbin` (decoded `.bin` differs only in MacBinary header dates — resource fork is byte-identical); `.sit` via `macunpack -f` (resource fork byte-identical). To confirm a `.sit` opens in real StuffIt, test in **Basilisk/System 7** (System 6 has no Expander). Details in the `reference_release_and_artifact_verification` and `reference_sit_stuffit_basilisk_test` memories.

## Testing

Emulator infrastructure lives in `/home/claude/emulators/`. See its docs for full details:
- `docs/TESTING.md` - build-deploy-test workflows for both emulators
- `docs/SNOW.md` - Snow emulator config, networking, keyboard
- `docs/SNOW-GUI-AUTOMATION.md` - X11/XTEST coordinate system and automation techniques

**IMPORTANT: Do NOT launch Snow, deploy to disk images, or run any automated testing unless the user explicitly asks. All testing and QA is done by the human. Only build and deploy when asked.**

### Emulator: Snow (System 6 - Primary)

- **Launch**: `DISPLAY=:0 /home/claude/emulators/snow/snowemu /home/claude/emulators/snow/geomys.snoww &`
- **Networking**: DaynaPORT SCSI/Link, NAT mode. Host services reachable at `192.168.7.167` (NOT the 10.0.0.1 gateway)
- **Deploy**: `./scripts/deploy.sh --target snow --auto-open` handles kill → build → copy → relaunch

### Emulator: Basilisk II (System 7 - Secondary)

- **Launch**: `/home/claude/emulators/basilisk/launch.sh`
- **Deploy**: `./scripts/deploy.sh --target basilisk` (copies to ExtFS shared dir - no Basilisk restart needed, just reopen the app inside the emulator)
- **System 6 incompatible** - Basilisk II cannot run System 6. Use Snow for System 6 testing.

### Emulator Rules (Critical - Violations Cause Data Corruption)

- **Never update a disk image while Snow is running** - the image is memory-mapped; corruption will result. Stop Snow by **explicit PID and verify** first — `pkill -f snowemu` matches the calling shell's own command line (self-kill, spurious exit 144) and `pkill -x` is unreliable: `P=$(pgrep -x snowemu); [ -n "$P" ] && kill -9 $P; sleep 2; pgrep -x snowemu` (must be empty). A stale instance left running while you deploy yields two Snows + a disk modified under one → "?" boot floppy (HFS usually survives; verify with `hmount`/`hls`).
- **Never run multiple Snow instances** or Snow and Basilisk II simultaneously - they share the X11 display.
- **Never hard-kill Basilisk II repeatedly** - corrupts the disk image and `sheep_net` kernel module. Quit from inside the emulator (Special > Shut Down) when possible. If you must kill externally, do it once and reset before relaunching:
  ```bash
  sudo rmmod sheep_net && sudo modprobe sheep_net
  cp ~/GlobalTalk\ System\ 761\ HD.hda /home/claude/emulators/disks/system7.hda
  ```
- **Use `scrot` for screenshots, NEVER ImageMagick `import`** - `import` grabs the X pointer and permanently breaks Snow mouse input.
  ```bash
  DISPLAY=:0 scrot -u /tmp/screenshot.png    # Focused window only
  ```
- **GUI automation requires XTEST incremental motion** - `xdotool mousemove` and `XWarpPointer` do NOT work with Snow. Use the canonical library: `/home/claude/emulators/scripts/snow_automation.py`
- **Mac Plus M0110 keyboard has no Escape or Control keys.** Snow faithfully emulates this - X11 Escape/Control keysyms are ignored.
  - Escape: Cmd+. (Right Alt + period)
  - Ctrl+letter: Option+letter (Left Alt + letter)
- Always set `DISPLAY=:0` when launching Snow or Basilisk II

## Repository Conventions

- Git remote (primary): `ssh://git@forgejo.ecliptik.com/ecliptik/geomys.git`
- GitHub (public): `https://github.com/ecliptik/geomys` - auto-mirrored from Forgejo; issues and pull requests are handled here
- GitHub Pages: marketing site at `https://ecliptik.github.io/geomys/`, served from `/docs` on `main` (`docs/index.html` + `docs/style.css`; hero images reference `docs/screenshots/` directly)
- Never push directly to GitHub - only push to Forgejo (primary). Releases are created on both via `release.sh`.
- Use feature branches for new features, squash commits when merging to main
- Never use git worktrees when working with agent teams
- Commits carry Claude Code's model-qualified attribution trailer (e.g. `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.8 <noreply@anthropic.com>`, naming the running model); no custom commit hook
- Always create a plan for implementing a feature and break into multiple phases
- Include short SHA in About Geomys for build identification
- Do NOT commit: disk images, GEOMYS.md, or other non-source artifacts
- Maintain: README.md, CHANGELOG.md
- Always print the full path of created disk images
- When taking screenshots of Snow, always crop to show only the full System 6 desktop

## Agent Teams

When creating a team, always include:
- **UI/UX reviewer** - reviews and offers guidance to keep Geomys aligned with Apple HIG
- **Macintosh 68000 and C expert** - reviews and offers guidance on performance, architecture, and feature implementation
- **Technical writer** - updates documentation as development progresses (CHANGELOG.md, README.md, docs/, About Geomys)

## Architecture

- Use C, optimize hot paths with assembly when needed
- Use native Macintosh toolkits (QuickDraw)
- Double buffering for smooth, flicker-free GUI
- Fully modularized build with feature flags (similar to Flynn)
- Code should be easy to understand and extend - break into modules, avoid large files
- Align with Apple Human Interface Guidelines (see references)
- Create About Geomys as TeachText document in docs/ (resource type `ttro`, reference Flynn's `docs/About Flynn`)
- When building the MVP, keep future features in mind to make them easier to implement later (keyboard nav, favorites, 256 color, themes, multi-window, System 7)
- All code is reviewed by Codex

## UI Design

- Web browser-style experience: address bar, back/forward/refresh/home, status bar
- Menus: File, Edit, Favorites, Options
- Monochrome for MVP
- Think like a 1980s Macintosh UI/UX designer
- Reference: Apple Human Interface Guidelines 1992
