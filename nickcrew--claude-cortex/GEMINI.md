## Architecture Overview

### Core Module Organization (`claude_ctx_py/`)

The Python package follows a domain-driven architecture:

```
claude_ctx_py/
├── cli.py              # Main CLI entrypoint (argparse-based)
├── core/               # Domain modules re-exported via __init__.py
│   ├── base.py         # Utilities, path resolution, YAML/front-matter parsing
│   ├── agents.py       # Agent graph, dependencies, activation
│   ├── skills.py       # Skill discovery, metrics, community integration
│   ├── rules.py        # Rule management
│   ├── hooks.py        # Hook installation and validation
│   ├── mcp.py          # MCP server discovery and configuration
│   ├── mcp_installer.py # MCP server installation

├── tui/                # Textual-based terminal UI
│   ├── main.py         # CortexApp (main application class)
│   ├── types.py        # TypedDicts for TUI data structures
│   ├── constants.py    # View bindings, profile descriptions
│   ├── dialogs/        # Modal dialogs (backup, profile editor, LLM settings)
│   └── widgets.py      # Custom Textual widgets
├── intelligence/       # AI-powered automation
│   ├── base.py         # SessionContext, AgentRecommendation dataclasses
│   ├── semantic.py     # Semantic matching (fastembed integration)
│   └── config.py       # Intelligence configuration
└── memory/             # Memory and context capture
    ├── capture.py      # Session capture
    ├── search.py       # Memory search
    └── notes.py        # Memory note management
```

### Plugin Assets Structure

The repository ships these asset directories that are symlinked into `~/.claude`:

```
agents/         # Claude subagent definitions (YAML front matter + markdown)
commands/       # Slash command definitions
rules/          # Reusable rule sets
skills/         # Core and community skills (127+)
hooks/          # Automation hooks for command workflows
```

### Key Architectural Patterns

**Path Resolution Chain**: The CLI resolves its data folder in order:
1. `CORTEX_SCOPE` (project/global/plugin)
2. `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` (set by Claude Code for plugin commands)
3. `CORTEX_ROOT` (default: `~/.cortex`)

**State Management**: Active assets tracked via `.active-*` state files (e.g., `.active-agents`, `.active-rules`), not CLAUDE.md comments.

**Front Matter Parsing**: Agent/skill metadata extracted from YAML front matter in markdown files via `_tokenize_front_matter()` and `_extract_front_matter()`.

**TUI Views**: The TUI uses Textual's `ContentSwitcher` with view IDs (0-9, plus named keys) for different screens (Overview, Agents, Skills, Rules, etc.). Each view has its own data refresh and action bindings.

## Type Checking

Mypy is configured with `--strict` in `pyproject.toml`. New modules should:

- Prefer `TypedDict`/`Protocol` over raw `dict`/`Any`
- Use explicit type annotations for Textual widget state
- Check `/tmp/mypy.log` for CI failure output when iterating locally

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

- Python uses Black (line length 88) and type hints; mypy is configured in `pyproject.toml`.
- YAML uses 2-space indentation and consistent key ordering.
- Markdown uses ATX headers and fenced code blocks with language tags.
- File/dir naming is lowercase hyphen-case (e.g., `skills/my-skill/`, `rules/git-rules.md`).

## Testing Guidelines

- Framework: pytest with markers like `unit`, `integration`, and `slow`.
- Conventions: `test_*.py` files, `Test*` classes, `test_*` functions.
- Run subsets: `pytest -m unit`, `pytest tests/integration/`, or `pytest tests/unit/test_composer.py`.
- Coverage target is 80% long term; minimums are enforced via `pyproject.toml`.

## Testing Conventions

- Markers: `unit`, `integration`, `slow`, `tui`, `cli`, `core`, `intelligence`
- Test files: `test_*.py`, classes: `Test*`, functions: `test_*`
- Coverage target: 80% (current minimum enforced: 15%)

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

- Recent commits use lowercase type prefixes like `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`, `test:` with optional scopes (`feat(agents):`).
- PR titles follow `[Feature] ...`, `[Fix] ...`, `[Docs] ...`; include summary, testing notes, checklist, related issues, and screenshots for UI changes.

## Local Configuration Tips

- Point the CLI to this repo for local testing: `export CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT="$(pwd)"`.
- Avoid committing generated `.active-*` state files from local runs.

## BACKLOG WORKFLOW INSTRUCTIONS

This project uses Backlog.md MCP for all task and project management activities.

**CRITICAL GUIDANCE**

- If your client supports MCP resources, read `backlog://workflow/overview` to understand when and how to use Backlog for this project.
- If your client only supports tools or the above request fails, call `backlog.get_workflow_overview()` tool to load the tool-oriented overview (it lists the matching guide tools).

- **First time working here?** Read the overview resource IMMEDIATELY to learn the workflow
- **Already familiar?** You should have the overview cached ("## Backlog.md Overview (MCP)")
- **When to read it**: BEFORE creating tasks, or when you're unsure whether to track work

These guides cover:
- Decision framework for when to create tasks
- Search-first workflow to avoid duplicates
- Links to detailed guides for task creation, execution, and finalization
- MCP tools reference

You MUST read the overview resource to understand the complete workflow. The information is NOT summarized here.
