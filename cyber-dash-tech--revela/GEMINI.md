## 0.18.1 Migration Override

0.18.0 is a breaking deck-first target. For current development, the default workflow is:

```text
Init -> Research -> Plan --deck -> Make --deck -> Review --deck -> Export
```

- Do not generate `revela-narrative/` during init, research, plan, make, review, or export.
- `/revela story` and `/revela make --brief` are removed from the public workflow.
- Research saves source-linked findings under `researches/`; it does not bind findings into vault evidence.
- `deck-plan.md` is the canonical execution plan. Legacy `deck-plan/index.md` and `deck-plan/slides/*.md` remain read-compatible only.
- Deck-plan slide blocks use `sourceLinks` for materials, findings, assets, URLs, and caveats. Legacy `narrativeLinks` inputs are compatibility-only.
- Design inventory must expose layout slots and component nesting hints; planned component slots must belong to the selected layout.
- Component plans support `children`; use `box.children` for semantic groups that contain text, media, charts, tables, stats, quotes, or steps.
- Review is Artifact QA plus Comment/Apply Fix. Insight/Inspect is removed from the public Review path.
- Export supports PDF, PPTX, and per-slide PNG.

Older 0.17 Narrative Vault guidance below remains release archaeology until it is fully deleted; when it conflicts with this override, follow the 0.18.1 rules above.

## Codex-First Maintenance Policy

Revela is now Codex-first. OpenCode support is legacy compatibility only.

- New features must target the Codex surface first: CLI/MCP runtime, `plugins/revela/`, Codex skills, Codex hooks, and Codex Review UI.
- Do not add new OpenCode-only slash commands, prompt transforms, subagents, or tool surfaces unless the user explicitly asks for legacy OpenCode maintenance.
- Preserve legacy OpenCode behavior when practical, but do not expand OpenCode parity for new Codex features.
- Shared deterministic logic should live in `lib/runtime/` or shared `lib/*`; adapters may wrap it.
- When a task mentions "Revela" without specifying a platform, assume Codex unless local context clearly indicates an OpenCode legacy issue.

## Product Baseline

Revela is a narrative artifact workspace for high-stakes communication. It is not a generic AI slide maker.

Product promise:

**Turn source materials, research, data, and user intent into trusted, traceable, presentation-ready decision artifacts.**

Current baseline: `0.17.24 release baseline`.

User-facing workflow:

```text
Init -> Research -> Story -> Make -> Review -> Export
System surface: Design
```

Decks are render targets. The durable core is source trust, canonical narrative state, evidence traceability, artifact coverage, and post-artifact reading/refinement.

## Non-Negotiable Product Rules

- `revela-narrative/` is the editable source of truth for communication meaning when present.
- Canonical narrative state (`NarrativeStateV1`) is the compiled internal interface for communication meaning.
- Target architecture is file-native: `revela-narrative/` for meaning, `deck-plan/` for render planning, `decks/*.html` for artifacts, `researches/` for findings, and `assets/` for media. `DECKS.json` should be removed as a product state center, not preserved as workflow authority.
- `deck-plan/`, when present, is the render-layer execution-plan workspace for slide order, chapter writing batches, visual intent, and evidence trace; it is not the source of canonical meaning.
- `DECKS.json.slides[]` must not be treated as the authoritative HTML slide-count contract. Artifact identity is self-consistent positive 1-based slide indexes, unique indexes, DOM order, and canvas validity; plan completeness belongs to `deck-plan/` projection Markdown when present.
- Vault workspaces must not persist top-level `DECKS.json.narrative`; runtime `state.narrative` may still be hydrated as a compatibility projection.
- `.revela/narrative-cache/` contains regenerable compiled projections and diagnostics, not editable source.
- Saved research findings are not evidence support until explicit evidence nodes or bindings preserve source, quote/snippet, support scope, unsupported scope, caveat, and strength.
- Do not invent quotes, source paths, URLs, page references, caveats, claim ids, evidence ids, or artifact coverage.
- Missing evidence must stay visible as a gap instead of being filled by the model.
- Workflow permission gates should be removed. Users decide whether to continue; Revela reports diagnostics, risks, missing information, and technical validity.
- Hard blockers are limited to technical artifact validity, data-safety/integrity protections, and executable preconditions such as missing files or ambiguous paths.
- Meaning changes update canonical narrative first; artifact or deck-plan alignment gaps should be reported as diagnostics, not approvals or workflow blockers.
- Pure artifact polish may stay artifact-level: layout, typography, spacing, crop, visual hierarchy, export mechanics, deck contract fixes, and similar non-meaning changes.

## Operating Priorities

When instructions conflict, resolve them in this order:

1. Source truth and data safety: never invent evidence, quotes, ids, paths, URLs, or coverage.
2. Canonical meaning: `revela-narrative/` and compiled `NarrativeStateV1` outrank render plans, artifacts, caches, and compatibility state.
3. Technical artifact validity: generated decks must have valid slide identity, DOM order, and canvas/export preconditions.
4. User intent and workflow momentum: report diagnostics and risks, but do not create approval gates unless a technical or data-safety blocker exists.
5. Visual polish and artifact-level edits: keep these scoped to artifacts unless they change communication meaning.

Roadmap sections describe direction, not default work. Do not start platformization, adapter rewrites, package splits, or broad file moves unless the user task explicitly asks for them.

## Current Command Surface

Primary commands:

- `/revela init`
- `/revela research`
- `/revela story`
- `/revela make --deck`
- `/revela make --brief`
- `/revela review --deck`
- `/revela export --deck pdf`
- `/revela export --deck pptx`
- `/revela enable`
- `/revela disable`
- `/revela design`
- `/revela domain`

Compatibility behavior:

- `/revela refine --deck` aliases `/revela review --deck` during the naming migration.
- `/revela edit` and `/revela inspect` should direct users to `/revela review --deck`.
- `/revela enable` and `/revela disable` are public session controls for Revela prompt/context injection.
- Revela starts enabled by default; `/revela disable` pauses prompt/context injection for the current session.
- Explicit workflow commands auto-enable Revela and choose the correct prompt mode even when Revela is disabled.
- State safety checks and write-after QA should remain active for controlled files/artifacts even when prompt injection is disabled.
- Blocking write-after QA and data-safety failures should be surfaced both in tool output and as concise user-visible notices.
- `/revela make --deck --desc "..."` is not implemented. Do not document it as supported until it exists.

## Workflow Principles

- Do not use long prompts as the workflow engine.
- Do not add eval because a roadmap item says "eval"; add deterministic boundaries only when they remove concrete prompt memory or unsafe LLM judgement.
- Prefer prompt-side authoring contracts, tool return contracts, Markdown QA feedback, state helpers, compiler diagnostics, and narrow hooks over generic workflow frameworks.
- Treat hooks as safety nets, not the primary authoring workflow.
- Use a prompt-before, QA-after control loop for Markdown authoring: prompts define the writing grammar up front, and hooks/tools return structured repair feedback after writes.
- If a hook repeatedly catches the same LLM-authored mechanical mistake, move the constraint into prompt-side authoring guidance and Markdown QA feedback.
- Use structured vault tools for narrow lifecycle or evidence-binding operations, not as a replacement for Markdown knowledge authoring.
- Add shared workflow/eval types only after at least two concrete boundaries need the same structure.
- Prompt lean-down should follow working tool boundaries, not precede them with abstract orchestration.

## Markdown Narrative Vault

Implemented 0.17 theme: **Markdown Narrative Vault**.

`revela-narrative/` is the visible, editable canonical narrative source when present. `compileNarrativeVault` compiles Markdown nodes deterministically into `NarrativeStateV1`; Story, Research, Make, Review, hashing, diagnostics, and artifact coverage continue to consume that stable internal interface.

Initial vault shape:

```text
revela-narrative/
  index.md
  audience.md
  decision.md
  thesis.md
  claims/
  evidence/
  objections/
  risks/
  research-gaps/
```

Markdown authoring rules:

- `revela-narrative/**/*.md` is the LLM-editable knowledge workspace.
- The LLM may maintain loose Markdown nodes for claims, evidence, objections, risks, research gaps, and lightweight inline relations.
- The graph is generated by `compileNarrativeVault`, not hand-maintained as hidden JSON.
- Use valid node types: `index`, `audience`, `decision`, `thesis`, `claim`, `evidence`, `objection`, `risk`, `research-gap`.
- Each node has one leading frontmatter block. Do not append a second `---` block.
- Do not duplicate stable headings such as `## Evidence`, `## Caveats`, `## Relations`, `## Response`, or `## Mitigation`.
- Relation lines use valid relation labels plus plain node-id wikilinks, for example `- supports: [[claim-recommendation]]`.
- Do not use typed wikilink targets such as `[[claim:claim-recommendation]]`.
- Evidence nodes must preserve source trace, quote/snippet, support scope, unsupported scope, caveat, and strength.
- Wikilink relations are the preferred graph source. Frontmatter bindings such as `claimId`, `targetId`, and `evidenceBindingIds` remain compatibility fallbacks for existing vaults and helper inputs.

Current inline relation behavior:

- Keep graph edges in node Markdown as lightweight `## Relations` wikilinks so the vault remains readable and navigable.
- `compileNarrativeVault` generates deterministic canonical relation ids; the LLM never hand-writes relation ids.
- Relation rationale may be written inline after the target, for example `- supports: [[claim-recommendation]] - Rationale text.`
- Use relation sync QA to report dangling edges, unbound evidence/objections/risks/gaps, isolated central claims, invalid relation types, typed wikilinks, and frontmatter-only compatibility bindings at the right workflow checkpoints.
- `compileNarrativeVault` derives evidence, objection, risk, and research-gap bindings from wikilink relations first. Frontmatter bindings compile only as fallback compatibility and should receive migration guidance instead of being treated as ideal authoring.

Structured helper role:

- Structured vault actions are optional safety helpers, not the primary authoring model.
- Prefer helpers when they reduce schema risk or express a narrow lifecycle action: `bindResearchFindings`, `upsertVaultEvidence`, `upsertVaultResearchGap`, `updateVaultResearchGap`.
- Incomplete helper usage should fail clearly and point to both Markdown repair and optional helper alternatives.
- JSON-era mutation actions such as `upsertNarrative`, `upsertResearchGaps`, and `applyEvidenceCandidates` are blocked or compatibility-only in vault workspaces.

## Phase Semantics

`init` means repeatable workspace ingest, local grounding, and intent capture.

- Scan workspace materials and register source-material candidates.
- On first init, treat supported workspace files as ingest candidates; on later runs, ingest added/changed/newer-than-vault files.
- Use `revela-decks init` and `initNarrativeVault` as expected controlled state/vault boundaries; empty-looking optional tool fields are schema display noise.
- Follow `ingest.suggestedTasks` from `revela-decks init`: read directly for text/Markdown/CSV, extract then read for PDF/Office files.
- Distill stable findings from ingested files into `revela-narrative/**/*.md`; source-material records alone are candidate context, not proof.
- Intent briefs and proposals may support audience, decision, thesis, stakeholder framing, and stated internal intent; they do not prove external market, competitor, product, or operating-model claims.
- Ask the smallest missing intent questions after local evidence has been considered.
- Do not require slide count, design choice, layout choice, output path, or visual style unless the user asks to make an artifact immediately.

`research` means evidence gathering, binding, claim narrowing, and caveat reduction beyond the current workspace.

- Start from deterministic tool outputs: summary read, vault diagnostics, story readiness, `deriveResearchTargets`, and `evaluateResearchFindings` when findings exist.
- Prefer binding or narrowing from existing saved findings before external research.
- Save external research to `researches/**/*.md`; research subagents must not call `revela-decks`.
- Bind evidence only when source, quote/snippet, support scope, unsupported scope, strength, caveat, and supported claim context are explicit and the binding does not expand the claim. New evidence should express the graph with `## Relations` such as `- supports: [[claim-id]]`; `claimId` is fallback compatibility.
- Use `bindResearchFindings` for bindable findings; otherwise report missing fields or source mismatch.
- Safe claim narrowing may edit `claims/*.md` only when it preserves strategic meaning and evidence boundaries. Broader rewrites require Story/user confirmation.
- Never use `upsertNarrative` during research.

`story` means the read-only claim-flow reading surface.

- Show claim text, evidence, why evidence supports or does not fully support the claim, and immediate relation context.
- Do not reintroduce workflow dashboards, filters, per-claim command suggestions, or artifact coverage panels into Story UI.
- Display localization may translate selected-claim cards, but must preserve claim ids, relation endpoints, source facts, quotes, findings paths, URLs, numbers, and canonical evidence boundaries.
- Do not write artifacts from Story mode.

`make --<target>` means render artifacts from canonical narrative state and, for decks, the current `deck-plan/` projection when present.

- Supported targets are `--deck` and `--brief`.
- Report narrative, evidence, deck-plan, and artifact alignment diagnostics before rendering, but do not treat missing approvals, stale approvals, unconfirmed plans, research gaps, or cached state incompleteness as workflow blockers; these approval concepts are migration targets to remove.
- Deck rendering uses canonical narrative plus `deck-plan/` projection and then runs technical artifact checks such as HTML contract protections.
- Brief rendering compiles from canonical narrative state and graph-backed claim/evidence relationships, not from a deck summary.

`review` means post-artifact reading, inspection, commenting, and asset-assisted editing.

- Comment is the mutation path for targeted deck changes and includes Local Assets/Search Assets.
- Insight is read-only and explains source, support strength, caveat, unsupported scope, narrative purpose, related risks/objections, research gaps, and artifact coverage.
- Pure visual/layout/export edits may patch artifacts directly after normal safety checks.
- Meaning-changing edits must update narrative state first and then re-make artifacts.

## Current 0.17 Baseline

0.17 is release-verified. This section lists current behavior only; detailed release archaeology belongs in `docs/AGENTS.archive.md`.

- Markdown Narrative Vault is the canonical authoring model: parser/compiler/cache/source loading, plugin-side auto-compile, Markdown QA after vault writes, and JSON narrative migration/export are in place.
- Vault workspaces do not persist top-level `DECKS.json.narrative`; runtime hydration remains compatibility-only, with `narrativeApprovals` stored outside the persisted narrative mirror.
- Init registers source-material candidates, follows `ingest.suggestedTasks`, and ends with discovery status, graph status, open gaps, clarification questions or no-clarification notice, and next-command guidance.
- Story is a focused read-only claim/evidence/gap reading surface backed by canonical narrative state.
- Research can derive targets, evaluate findings, save findings, and bind safe evidence through vault helpers while preserving evidence boundaries.
- Make/Review/Export are file-native: deck-plan projection guides rendering when present, deck HTML is validated by artifact contract/QA, Review asset state is saved, and PDF/PPTX export remains supported.
- Design-aware deck rendering fetches active design rules before layouts/components; built-in designs own Lucide, ECharts, chart rules, and foundation-first guidance. Codex deck patches require a recent active-design rules read before writing deck HTML.
- Codex can create and validate local design packages through runtime/MCP design create/validate tools, with natural-language Quick Start guidance for custom design creation.
- The 0.17.10 hotfix keeps Codex MCP basic tools usable from Git marketplace clones without installed package dependencies; browser/export-heavy tools load their dependencies only when invoked.
- The 0.17.11 hotfix launches Codex Review Comment/Apply Fix through `codex exec --sandbox workspace-write` while keeping Insight read-only, and reports read-only sandbox write blocks as Review bridge failures instead of completed comments.
- The 0.17.12 hotfix adds `--skip-git-repo-check` to Codex Review `codex exec` calls so Review UI Insight and Apply Fix work in ordinary non-Git deck folders.
- The 0.17.13 hotfix improves Codex Review UI bridge reliability: Codex-backed Review opens through `/codex-review`, streams Insight and Apply Fix progress through SSE, preserves execution logs, clears stale inline progress after deck updates, and adds MCP package smoke coverage.
- The 0.17.14 hotfix refreshes Review UI visual target metadata after direct visual edits, so resizing the same element repeatedly no longer fails stale target validation.
- The 0.17.15 hotfix reports the running Revela npm package version from `revela doctor` and the Codex MCP `revela_doctor` tool.
- The 0.17.17 hotfix exports slide-as-canvas decks to PDF by clipping each `.slide` when `.slide-canvas` is absent, while keeping `.slide-canvas` as the canonical deck structure.
- The 0.17.18 release adds Codex design creation/validation workflow support, Codex deck-write design-rules guard coverage, and Quick Start guidance for natural-language custom design creation.
- The 0.17.19 hotfix keeps `.slide-canvas` as the fixed 1920x1080 export surface while allowing `.slide` to remain a viewport/navigation wrapper in canonical decks and design previews.
- The 0.17.20 hotfix synchronizes the Codex MCP launcher package pin with the release version so publish CI validates the packaged launcher contract.
- The 0.17.21 hotfix adds Codex upgrade guidance, a `revela-upgrade` skill that checks `revela_doctor` first, and release-aligned Codex install pins.
- The 0.17.23 hotfix makes Codex design list/read/inventory/layout/component/validate paths read bundled designs without seeding user config, adds explicit design inventory/layout/component MCP tools, and preserves user design overrides.
- The 0.17.24 hotfix adds the Codex `revela_upsert_deck_plan_slide` MCP tool for structured single-slide deck-plan upserts, parses `componentPlan[]` through `revela_read_deck_plan`, validates planned layouts/components against design inventory, and updates Codex make-deck/design skills to use tool-backed slide planning before HTML generation.

## Wikilink-First Vault Graph

Goal: keep the 0.17.0 Markdown vault graph authoring model Obsidian-style and wikilink-first.

Human authors and LLMs should express graph meaning primarily through node-local `## Relations` sections with plain `[[node-id]]` wikilinks. `compileNarrativeVault` derives canonical `NarrativeStateV1` fields from those links before falling back to frontmatter bindings such as `claimId`, `targetId`, and `evidenceBindingIds`.

Target mental model:

```text
claim-a.md
  <- supports <- evidence-a.md  (`- supports: [[claim-a]]`)
  <- derived through evidence <- gap-a.md (`- depends_on: [[evidence-a]]`)
```

Canonical relation syntax:

```md
## Relations

- supports: [[claim-a]] - Optional rationale.
- depends_on: [[evidence-a]]
- constrains: [[claim-b]]
- answers: [[objection-a]]
```

Do not use `[[supports:claim-a]]`; Obsidian treats that as a page id instead of a typed edge to `claim-a`.

Compiler behavior:

- Wikilink relations are the first source for evidence, objection, risk, and research-gap bindings; frontmatter fields are fallback compatibility only.
- `evidence -> supports -> claim` derives `NarrativeEvidenceBinding.claimId`.
- `objection -> answers/contrasts_with -> claim` and `risk -> constrains -> claim` derive their canonical claim bindings.
- `gap -> depends_on -> claim/evidence/objection/risk`; gap-to-evidence links preserve evidence ids and derive claim context through evidence support when available.
- Canonical gaps keep schema compatibility by storing evidence dependencies in `evidenceBindingIds` and deriving `targetType: "claim"` when evidence supports a claim.
- Inventory and Markdown QA explain official wikilink relations, warn on frontmatter-only fallback bindings, and block dangling wikilinks, invalid relation labels, typed wikilinks, and unbound nodes at readiness/render strictness.
- Vault helpers and prompts require new evidence, gaps, risks, and objections to write `## Relations`; source trace fields remain separate from graph links.

## Version Roadmap

### Platform Runtime And Adapter Roadmap

Goal: keep Revela Codex-first while preserving legacy OpenCode compatibility where practical. The product architecture should remain `shared core/runtime -> CLI/MCP -> platform adapters`, with Codex as the primary product surface and OpenCode as a legacy adapter over shared deterministic capabilities.

This roadmap is not ambient work. Start it only when the user explicitly asks for platform runtime, CLI/MCP, Codex adapter, or cross-platform packaging work. For unrelated tasks, preserve existing OpenCode behavior and avoid broad moves.

When implementing this roadmap, start from the Codex CLI/MCP runtime boundary, then update the ADR and capability matrix before adding new adapter surfaces.

Non-negotiable compatibility rules:

- Existing OpenCode Revela commands should keep working when practical: `/revela init`, `/revela research`, `/revela story`, `/revela make --deck`, `/revela make --brief`, `/revela review --deck`, and `/revela export --deck pdf/pptx`.
- Codex support is the primary target for new work, not an additive parity layer over OpenCode.
- Do not remove `plugin.ts`, `lib/commands/*`, OpenCode tool schemas, OpenCode subagents, or prompt-mode routing without an explicit breaking-release task.
- Shared runtime extraction should happen behind tests that protect Codex behavior first and avoid accidental legacy OpenCode regressions.
- Codex plugin code should call shared CLI/MCP/runtime capabilities; it must not duplicate narrative compiler, deck QA, export, design, or state logic.

Target architecture:

- Shared runtime/core: narrative vault compile, Markdown QA, deck-plan read/compile, design/domain registry reads, deck foundation creation, artifact contract/QA, PDF/PPTX export, media/source-material helpers.
- CLI boundary: `revela doctor`, `revela compile`, `revela markdown-qa`, `revela deck-plan read`, `revela deck-foundation`, `revela qa`, `revela export pdf`, `revela export pptx`, `revela design list`, and `revela design read --section ...`, with `--json` for deterministic adapter output.
- MCP boundary: thin tools over the shared runtime such as `revela_compile_narrative`, `revela_markdown_qa`, `revela_read_deck_plan`, `revela_create_deck_foundation`, `revela_run_deck_qa`, `revela_export_pdf`, `revela_export_pptx`, `revela_design_list`, and `revela_design_read`.
- Codex adapter: `plugins/revela/` with `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`, `.mcp.json`, Codex-friendly skills, hooks, assets, and setup/doctor support.
- OpenCode adapter: keep current slash commands/tools/prompt context stable as legacy compatibility while gradually thinning implementation to shared runtime calls when needed.

Execution order:

- Define MVP scope and work on a platform branch/worktree such as `feature/platform-runtime`.
- Write or update the ADR and capability matrix before implementation.
- Build the CLI boundary first with structured JSON output and no OpenCode runtime injection dependency.
- Add MCP as a thin wrapper over shared runtime/CLI contracts, then evolve the Codex plugin skills, hooks, marketplace metadata, and setup/doctor checks.
- Add conformance coverage for narrative inspection, deck QA, PDF/PPTX export, research handoff, and Codex CLI/MCP results; OpenCode parity coverage is optional legacy maintenance.
- Consider package/repo splits only after contracts are stable.

Deferred until after MVP stability:

- Exact Codex slash-command parity with OpenCode `/revela ...` commands.
- Full Review UI parity inside Codex.
- Large OpenCode adapter rewrites or broad import-path moves.
- Public Codex marketplace distribution and package split.

## Tool And State Rules

- `DECKS.json` is no longer target product state. Do not add new workflow authority there; remove or replace existing reads/writes during the file-native migration.
- Do not require generated deck HTML to match cached `DECKS.json.slides[]` length during chapter-by-chapter authoring; partial artifacts are allowed when written slide identities are valid. The render execution plan should come from `deck-plan/` projection Markdown when present, not from cached `DECKS.json.slides[]`.
- `deck-plan.md` is render-layer projection state. Legacy `deck-plan/` files may be read for compatibility, but new plan writes should use the single Markdown file.
- Do not patch generated cache files as source. Edit `revela-narrative/**/*.md` for narrative meaning and regenerate compiled projections.
- Edits to `revela-narrative/**/*.md` trigger plugin-side compile/guard reporting through write/edit/apply_patch hooks.
- `revela-research-save` writes findings markdown under `researches/{topic}/{filename}.md`; it does not automatically make findings canonical support.
- `revela-decks attachResearchFindings` attaches a workspace-relative findings file to a matching research axis. It does not mutate slide evidence or deck HTML.
- `revela-decks applyEvidenceCandidates` and evidence-status services are compatibility-only. Canonical support should be created through `revela-narrative/evidence/*.md` or `bindResearchFindings`, then compiled.
- `revela-workspace-scan` discovers candidate documents and records provenance when possible; scan actions are not proof.
- `revela-extract-document-materials` writes extraction cache under `.revela/doc-materials/{fingerprint}/` and updates `workspace.sourceMaterials` when `DECKS.json` exists.
- `revela-media-save` and `revela-media-batch-save` promote image leads into workspace assets under `assets/<topic>/media/` and update the media manifest.
- Review asset search results are remote candidates only until saved. Deck HTML should reference saved workspace asset paths, never remote candidate URLs or `/__revela_asset` proxy URLs.
- Inspection/result tools submit structured JSON for browser UI. Do not rely on assistant Markdown parsing for Review UI state.
- Design tools may read active design sections/components/layouts from `~/.config/revela`. Do not inject full design context outside deck-render flows.

## Deck Render Grammar

Use the current simplified built-in design grammar:

- `box` - card/group primitive for one idea, case, evidence item, metric, objection, risk, or action.
- `text-panel` - title/body/bullets/source-note language module.
- `media` - normal image/screenshot/diagram/logo/portrait component.
- `echart-panel` - chart frame and caption/source structure.
- `data-table` - structured table component.
- `steps` - process or phase sequence.
- `roadmap-horizontal` and `roadmap-vertical` - dated phases, milestones, historical evolution, or future plans.
- `hero` - full-bleed cover, section divider, closing, or strong visual statement.
- `stat-card`, `quote`, and `toc` - defined pattern components.
- `page-number` and `brand-watermark` - utilities.

Composition hierarchy:

```text
layout -> box/card -> text-panel + media/chart/table/stat/quote
```

Rules:

- Use layouts for page-level structure.
- Use `box` for semantic cards/groups.
- Use `text-panel` for language, not as a whole-page narrative concept.
- Put `media`, `echart-panel`, or `data-table` inside a `box` when they support the same idea as the text.
- Use `hero` only for cover/divider/closing visuals; never use it inside a `box` or for screenshots, charts, tables, diagrams, or source evidence that must stay readable.
- Do not expose `image-title`, `media--cover`, `editorial-*`, `flow-*`, `timeline-journey-*`, or `svg-motif` as primary component choices.

## Review Asset Rules

Use a three-stage model:

```text
remote candidate -> workspace asset -> deck usage
```

- Remote candidates are search results only. They are not durable workspace state and must not be written directly into deck HTML.
- Workspace assets are saved local files plus manifest metadata. Deck HTML should reference workspace-relative local paths, not remote URLs or Review/Refine proxy URLs.
- Deck usage is artifact-level visual placement unless the image is explicitly source evidence.
- Preserve source URL, source page URL, provider, license, attribution, alt text, purpose, and dimensions when known. Never invent missing licensing or attribution fields.
- License-unknown assets may be used as visual drafts only when clearly marked; do not imply commercial clearance.
- Logo assets should remain small, clear, and brand-like; do not use them as decorative backgrounds.
- Screenshots, diagrams, charts, and evidence images must remain readable and should not be converted into decorative hero imagery.

## Prompt Modes

- Default prompt mode is narrative mode from `skill/NARRATIVE_SKILL.md`.
- Deck-render mode uses legacy deck/render instructions from `skill/SKILL.md` plus the active design layer.
- Full domain guidance is narrative-only and is not injected into deck-render mode.
- `init`, `research`, `story`, `review` shell/Insight, `remember`, and ambient Revela chat use narrative mode.
- `make --deck`, Review Comment deck HTML edits, legacy edit Comment, deck HTML generation, PDF/PPTX implications, layout/component fetching, and design QA use deck-render mode.
- Session-scoped command intent is one-shot. Clear pending intent after appending it to the system prompt.
- Prefer plugin/tool output over expanding prompts when a repeated rule can be computed from state.

## Engineering Workflow

- `main` must stay releasable. Use a dedicated branch for non-trivial work.
- Use `feature/*` for product work, `fix/*` for bug fixes, and `spike/*` or `experiment/*` for uncertain exploration.
- Never revert or overwrite unrelated user changes.
- Do not use destructive git commands unless explicitly requested.
- Do not commit unless the user explicitly asks.
- Prefer small, correct changes over broad rewrites.
- Use `apply_patch` for manual edits.
- Default to ASCII unless the file already uses non-ASCII or the content requires it.

## Verification

Use the smallest meaningful verification first, then expand when release risk warrants it.

Common checks:

```bash
bun run typecheck
bun test
npm pack --dry-run
```

Focused tests are preferred during development when they cover the changed module. Run the full suite before release, command-surface changes, state migrations, prompt-mode changes, or export/QA changes.

README badge counts may lag behind the current test suite. Re-run the relevant checks before changing docs, badges, release metadata, command surfaces, state migrations, prompt modes, export, or QA behavior.

## Release SOP

Pre-release gate:

```bash
bun test
bun run typecheck
npm pack --dry-run
```

Version and publish through GitHub Actions:

```bash
npm version patch   # or minor / major
git push origin main --tags
```

The `v*` tag triggers `.github/workflows/publish.yml`, which runs tests/typecheck and publishes to npm with `NPM_TOKEN`.

After every release, update `AGENTS.md` to reflect the new product baseline, command surface, known limits, and current agent rules. Archive release archaeology in `docs/AGENTS.archive.md` instead of letting this guide grow.

Do not bump versions or publish without an explicit release request.

## Historical Reference

Use `docs/AGENTS.archive.md` only when you need detailed release archaeology, old OpenCode plugin API notes, or legacy implementation history. Prefer this file for current decisions and behavior.
