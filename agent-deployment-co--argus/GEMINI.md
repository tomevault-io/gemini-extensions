# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## ⚠️ This is a public repository

**Argus is public open source.** Never commit or push private, sensitive, or personal data —
not in code, tests, fixtures, comments, docs, or commit messages. This includes:

- **Secrets**: API keys, tokens, certificates, credentials, `.env` values.
- **Data stores**: `argus.db`, `argus.json`, the contents of `$ARGUS_CONFIG_DIR`/`$ARGUS_CACHE_DIR`,
  or any indexed/cached output produced by running Argus locally.
- **Agent session data**: real Claude/Codex/Gemini transcripts, prompts, or any captured
  conversation content from `~/.claude`, `~/.codex`, etc.
- **Local file information**: real home/user paths, machine names, directory listings, or anything
  that identifies a specific user or machine.
- **PII**: names, emails, org/customer identifiers, or any personal information.

When you need example data, synthesize it. Use redacted, obviously-fake fixtures (e.g. `/Users/you`,
`user@example.com`). When in doubt, leave it out and ask.

## What this is

**Who it's for.** Argus is built for **business users, not developers** — people who use agents to
do their *business* work, not to build software. The audience spans a range, from knowledge workers
who never open a terminal to technical non-developers who run Claude Code and write the occasional
script. When you design features, write copy, or choose examples/taxonomies, assume that range and
never assume a developer.

**`docs/contributing/audience.md` is the canonical audience definition** — read it before writing
anything user-facing or designing anything, and don't restate it elsewhere. Never call them
"non-coders" or talk down.

**How we describe Argus is canonical in `docs/contributing/positioning.md`** — the promise, the
approved descriptions, which register each surface uses, which agents the descriptions name, and
the inventory of every place a description lives. Anything outward-facing (the README, the repo
description, package metadata, social cards, release notes) comes from there.

Argus audits local agent usage — Claude Code, Claude Cowork, Claude Chat, Codex, and Gemini — by
reading local session transcripts (`~/.claude/projects/**/*.jsonl`, `~/.codex/sessions/**/*.jsonl`,
…). All parsing is local. **Most users run the desktop app**, and it's the preferred way to interact
with Argus: a Tauri **tray app** (`desktop/`) that wraps the CLI — it bundles the compiled `argus`
binary plus the web assets, supervises `argus run` in the background, opens the dashboard in the
user's default browser through a stable local front-door port (default `4242`, proxied so an open
tab survives background restarts), and auto-updates. The tray app is the front door; the CLI is the
engine underneath.

That engine is a Bun + TypeScript CLI, and the more technical end of the audience can run it
directly. `serve` runs the local **web app** — a React SPA (see `docs/internals/web-app.md`) that is
the dashboard the desktop app opens. `index` reads transcripts into the local store (`argus.db`).
`sync` (formerly `push`) uploads per-(org, user) usage data to an **Argus Hub** — a hosted backend a
company runs to pool its users' usage.
`run` ties the long-running pieces together (`index --watch` + `serve`, plus `sync --watch` when a
Hub is configured) in one supervised process — this is what the desktop app runs. Nothing is
uploaded during `serve`/`index`; the only data that ever leaves the machine is what `sync` sends.

This repo is the public CLI, its web app (`web/`), and the desktop tray shell (`desktop/`). The
Hub's own code (the backend `sync` uploads to) lives in a **separate public repo**,
`agentdeploymentco/argus-hub`.

## Commands

```bash
bun run src/cli.ts serve --open          # run the interactive web app (needs build:web once)
bun run dev:web                           # Vite dev server for web/ (live reload; proxies /api → 4242)
bun test                                  # run all tests (uses bun:test, zero extra deps)
bun test test/parse.test.ts               # run a single test file
bun test -t "dedup"                       # run tests matching a name
bun run typecheck                         # tsc --noEmit for root src + web/ (also run in CI)
bun run build:web                         # build web/ → dist/web
bun run build:compile                     # compile a self-contained CLI binary → dist/argus (bun:sqlite, no Node)
bun run build:npm                         # build the publishable npm package set → dist/npm/* (all OS/arch)
bun run desktop:build                     # build the Tauri tray app (per-OS bundle) → desktop/src-tauri/target/**
```

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) typechecks the root and `web/`, runs `bun test`, and verifies
`build:web` on every PR and on pushes to `main`. Development runs `src/cli.ts`
directly with Bun. There is no Node-targeted bundle: the CLI compiles to a self-contained binary
with `bun build --compile` (it uses `bun:sqlite`, so it needs no Node/node-gyp). `bun run build:npm`
emits per-OS packages under `dist/npm/` — a launcher package (`@agentdeploymentco/argus`, the
published `bin`) plus `@agentdeploymentco/argus-<os>-<cpu>` prebuilt-binary packages it pulls in as
optional dependencies. The web app builds to `dist/web` and ships beside each binary. The desktop
tray app lives in `desktop/` and bundles the compiled CLI as a sidecar.
The repo root `package.json` is `private` (a dev workspace); the published artifacts are generated
into `dist/npm/` and the desktop bundles, not the root package.

## User-facing messages

Anything printed to the terminal (CLI `log()`/`console` output, help text, error messages) follows
**`docs/contributing/voice-and-tone.md` ("Writing for the terminal")**: plain language, no code
internals, active voice, and Argus is not the subject ("Kept archived sessions.", not "Argus kept
archived sessions."). Agent and concept names come from
**`docs/contributing/terminology.md`**.

These rules are for output the user sees. Code comments and internal identifiers stay precise and
may use the internal vocabulary freely.

## User-facing UI

Rules for anything presented in the web app (and any other UI surface):

1. **Never present an unordered list.** Every list the user sees — `<select>` options, table rows,
   card grids, legends, any enumeration — must have an ordering that is obvious to the user. A list
   in arbitrary/source/insertion order is a bug.
2. **Pick the ordering that fits the context.** If there's a natural temporal order (newest/oldest)
   or numeric order (by tokens, cost, count, duration), use it — that's usually what the user wants
   to scan by, and make the sort direction unmistakable. **If there is no meaningful temporal or
   numeric ordering, sort alphabetically ascending.** (E.g. the LLM provider select has no inherent
   ranking, so it should be alpha — not registry/declaration order.)
3. **Sort the data, don't rely on how it arrived.** Order explicitly at the point of display (or in
   the query) so it can't drift when the underlying source reorders.

## Writing about Argus

**`docs/contributing/` is canonical for every user-facing word**, not just the docs site: the web
app, the terminal, the README, the GitHub repo description and topics, package metadata, social
cards, release notes and outreach. Five guides, each owning one question:

| Guide | Owns |
|---|---|
| `audience.md` | Who Argus is for. Upstream of the rest, and it governs product decisions too. |
| `positioning.md` | What we claim: the promise, canonical descriptions, which claims are safe, register per surface, and the inventory of every place a description lives. |
| `voice-and-tone.md` | How Argus sounds, including terminal output, and the patterns to cut. |
| `terminology.md` | What we call things: product concepts, agent names, commands, and the words that stay in the code. |
| `technical-writing.md` | How a docs page is built. The only guide scoped to `docs/`. |

Read `audience.md` before writing anything user-facing. Note in particular: no em-dashes anywhere,
never call the audience "non-coders", and don't surface code internals outside `docs/internals/`.

Changing how Argus is described means updating `positioning.md` first, then working its surface
inventory so the surfaces don't drift apart. The `docs/contributing/` guides (and the
`docs/internals/` design docs) are excluded from the published site (`srcExclude`).

## Architecture

The pipeline is a one-way data flow, and `src/` is laid out by stage (full map in
`docs/internals/architecture.md`): **`src/indexing/`** (the pipeline — discover, parse, reconcile,
materialize, plus the interpret drain), **`src/store/`** (the `argus.db` layer + its parse→store
contract), **`src/reporting/`** (per-session and plugin aggregation), and **`src/api/`** (the serve
layer). Cross-cutting modules (`types.ts`, `config.ts`, `paths.ts`, `pricing.ts`, `tool-categories.ts`,
**`src/llm/`** [the shared LLM access layer], **`secrets.ts`** [BYO API-key storage]) and the
CLI/runtime layer (`cli.ts`, `run.ts`, `watch.ts`, `index-ops.ts`) stay at `src/` root.

The data flow:

`indexing/` (Discover → Parse → Reconcile → Materialize; Interpret runs afterwards as a decoupled, throttled drain — model-driven, default-on but toggleable) → `store/` → (`api/serve.ts` per-view endpoints for the web app | `push.ts` raw-row upload for `sync`)

The full module-by-module map lives in `docs/internals/architecture.md`, with per-subsystem design
docs alongside it (`web-app.md`, `configuration.md`, `llm-providers.md`, `task-interpretation.md`).
What follows is the load-bearing set — the invariants and gotchas worth keeping in context, the kind
you'd cause a bug by not knowing:

- **Accuracy lives in the producers** (`indexing/parse/producers/*`, one per source: `claude`,
  `claude-chat`, `cowork`, `codex`, `gemini`). They walk directories **recursively** so subagent
  transcripts (`<session>/subagents/*.jsonl`) are included, and **dedupe** assistant messages by API
  `message.id` (first wins) because resumed/compacted sessions re-append earlier messages verbatim.
  Claude and Codex have **different transcript shapes**, parsed by separate branches; cache accounting
  splits Anthropic's 5m/1h ephemeral buckets and treats Codex `cached_input_tokens` as a cache **read**.
- **Indexing is the sole writer of the reconciled session data** (`argus.db`'s `resolved_*` rows): it
  reconciles then materializes at write time, so consumers `SELECT` finished rows and never reconcile
  on read. `serve` and `sync` write too, but only their own state — `serve` persists user actions
  (labels, hidden sessions, settings), `sync` its upload cursors — never the session data.
- **Interpret runs *after* materialize**, as a decoupled, throttled, **default-on** (toggleable) drain
  — not between reconcile and materialize. Materialize writes only structural rows (**no
  interpretations**); interpret then writes the model's per-session **title + summary** and its
  **tasks** (`resolved_tasks`), stamping each interaction's `task_seq`.
- **No monolithic `Dashboard`.** Each `serve` view is its own small endpoint — a promoted store read
  plus a pure builder in `api/` — with no server-side cache; `sync` uploads reconciled rows (plus
  labels) that the Hub aggregates. `web/src/types.ts` imports the response types **type-only** from
  `src/`, so the API payload and the UI can't drift.
- **What crosses the sync wire, and what doesn't.** `sync` uploads the reconciled rows *and the
  interpretations*: sessions (with the model's title/summary), usage, `resolved_tasks` (the full
  `TaskFact` — outcome, frustration, signals), interactions (with `task_seq`), invocations, and user
  **labels**. Only two things never leave the machine: the retained prompt/response **text**
  (`resolved_interaction_text`, toggleable via `retainText`) and **BYO API keys** (`secrets.ts`) — so
  the interpretations *derived from* the text upload, but the raw text does not.
- **Canonical tool/MCP parsing lives in `tool-categories.ts`** (`categorizeTool`, `parseMcpTool` — the
  `mcp__server__tool` split). Route through it so categorization and MCP naming stay consistent.
- **All LLM access goes through `src/llm/`.** `registry.ts` is the single source of truth (adding a
  provider is one descriptor + one registry entry); `complete()` never throws
  (off/no-key/network/bad-shape → `ok:false`), so consumers branch on `ok`, not exceptions.
- **Friction signals are Claude-only** (interruptions, permission rejections, compactions, turn
  durations). Codex/Gemini sessions leave friction **undefined** (unknown), not zero.
- **Settings live in `config.ts` / `argus.json`,** resolved through one chain: `managed > flag > env
  > argus.json > default` (the top `managed` layer is org-managed MDM settings, `managed-config.ts`).
  The CLI (`cli.ts`, on citty) wraps the pipeline commands (`index`/`serve`/`sync`/`run`) plus
  `status`, `search` (full-text over sessions), `config`, and `secret`; `run` supervises
  `index --watch` + `serve` (+ `sync --watch`) in one process.
- **The desktop app (`desktop/`) is a Tauri tray shell around the CLI** (macOS and Windows) — how most
  users run Argus. It spawns `argus run` as a bundled sidecar and proxies a fixed front-door port
  (default `4242`) so the browser dashboard survives sidecar restarts; it auto-updates. Native code is
  `desktop/src-tauri/` (sidecar supervision in `lib.rs`, the front-door proxy in `proxy.rs`).

## The wire contract (important)

`Dashboard`/`SessionRow` (and the usage/day/plugin row types) are plain local types in `types.ts`,
extended there with CLI-only fields (e.g. `bySource`, `source`). They used to come from an external
`@agentdeploymentco/argus-schema` package; that dependency was retired once it was down to type-only
imports (the Hub backend had inlined its own copies and dropped it too).

`sync` no longer assembles or uploads a `Dashboard`: `push.ts` uploads the reconciled rows — sessions
(with model title/summary), usage, `resolved_tasks`, interactions, invocations — plus session
`labels`, and the Hub aggregates them (the old `PushPayloadSchema`-vs-`Dashboard` CI check is gone).
`Dashboard` still backs the web app's per-view response types (imported type-only by `web/src/types.ts`
from `src/types.ts`); the wire contract itself is being reworked separately.

Two things stay off the wire entirely: the retained prompt/response text (`resolved_interaction_text`)
and BYO API keys (`secrets.ts`). The task *interpretations* built from that text (outcome, frustration,
chapter span) do upload — the raw text doesn't. Separately, `store/store-contract.ts` (the parse→store
fact contract, including `PARSED_FRAGMENT_CONTRACT_VERSION`) is its own contract, distinct from the
`Dashboard`/`SessionRow` types above.
