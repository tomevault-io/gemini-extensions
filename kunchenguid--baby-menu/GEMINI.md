# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance for developing baby-menu itself.
Embedded agents launched from baby-menu should work from the active extension workspace and follow the copied `AGENTS.md` there for extension authoring.

## Commands

- `pnpm dev` - runs `scripts/dev.mjs`, prepares a gitignored `extensions-dev/` workspace by copying `extensions/AGENTS.md`, `extensions/babymenu-env.d.ts`, and `extensions/recipes/`, builds bundled ACP adapters into `out/adapters/`, and runs `electron-vite dev` from the current checkout. The app itself sees current uncommitted changes, while the embedded agent is launched inside `extensions-dev/`.
- `pnpm dev:reset` - removes `extensions-dev/` and `.cache/baby-menu/acp-sessions`, recreates the dev workspace with the latest `extensions/AGENTS.md`, `extensions/babymenu-env.d.ts`, and `extensions/recipes/`, and starts dev mode.
- `pnpm build` - build main, preload, renderer, and bundled ACP adapter bundles into `out/`.
- `pnpm generate:contracts` - regenerates `extensions/babymenu-env.d.ts` (the `@babymenu/contracts` surface) from `src/shared/contracts.ts`. Run after changing any extension-facing type or `src/shared/extension-contract-names.ts`, then commit the result; CI fails on a stale file.
- `pnpm package:mac` - cleans `release/`, builds the app, packages `release/mac-universal/Baby Menu Dev.app`, and ad-hoc signs it for local testing. Local/dev packaging uses `electron-builder.dev.yml`, which overrides `appId` to `com.kunchenguid.baby-menu.dev` and `productName` to `Baby Menu Dev` so locally-built bundles never collide with the released app (`com.kunchenguid.baby-menu`) in macOS LaunchServices. The CI release workflow builds from `electron-builder.yml` directly and keeps the production identity.
- `pnpm dist:mac` - runs `package:mac` and creates `release/Baby-Menu-<version>-universal.dmg` from the dev bundle.
- `pnpm test` - run all Vitest tests.
- `pnpm test:e2e` - run only `tests/e2e-*.test.ts` (these include real `acpx/runtime` coverage against `acp-mock` plus bundled adapter coverage against fake local CLIs).
- `pnpm typecheck` / `pnpm lint` - both run `tsc --noEmit` against `tsconfig.json`.
- Single test: `pnpm vitest run tests/<name>.test.ts` (or `pnpm vitest run -t "<name pattern>"`).

Use `pnpm` (declared `packageManager: pnpm@11.1.1`). Renderer dev server is pinned to port 5273 (`strictPort: true`).

### Packaging hygiene for automation (no-mistakes and other agents)

Agents running in `no-mistakes` worktrees (or any throwaway checkout) must not leave packaged macOS bundles behind.
A `release/mac-universal/*.app` left on disk gets auto-registered by macOS LaunchServices, and stale registrations make `open -a "Baby Menu"`, login items, and bundle-id launches resolve to the wrong build.
Follow these rules:

- If a packaged bundle is genuinely required, build it (it will carry the `com.kunchenguid.baby-menu.dev` identity), then delete the entire `release/` directory before the run finishes so nothing is left for LaunchServices to register.
- Never set a locally-built bundle as a macOS login item, and never install one into `/Applications`. The released app is delivered only through the Homebrew cask.

## Dev mode helpers

- `BABY_MENU_KEEP_POPOVER_OPEN=1` disables the blur-to-hide behavior so the popover stays open while devtools / external windows have focus.
- `BABY_MENU_AGENT=<agent-name>` overrides agent auto-detection when no saved Settings choice exists. E2E tests pass `acpx-mock` via `registryOverrides`.
- `BABY_MENU_AGENT_TIMEOUT_MS=<ms>` overrides the embedded-agent request timeout.
- `BABY_MENU_TELEMETRY=0` (or `false` / `off`) disables packaged-release telemetry; `BABY_MENU_UMAMI_HOST` and `BABY_MENU_UMAMI_WEBSITE_ID` override the self-hosted Umami target for telemetry testing.
- `process.env.VITEST` is checked in `src/main/app.ts` so importing the main entry from tests does not auto-start the Electron app.

## Architecture

This is a macOS tray-bar Electron app whose distinguishing idea is that an embedded agent (running via `acpx/runtime`) edits the active extension workspace at runtime.
Tracked source extensions use git as the accept/rollback mechanism when selected explicitly; packaged mode edits `~/.baby-menu/extensions` and uses filesystem snapshots.

Three processes, kept deliberately separate:

1. **Main** (`src/main/`) - app lifecycle, tray, popover window, IPC, git, agent runtime. Never call agent or git from the renderer directly.
2. **Preload** (`src/preload/index.ts`) - the stable bridge. Exposes `window.babyMenu` via `contextBridge`. Do not add one-off preload methods for each widget.
3. **Renderer** (`src/renderer/`) - React UI: `AgentChat`, `WidgetHost`, `SettingsView`, `UpdateIndicator`, and app-shell controls such as Quit. Widgets and extension settings sections should be hot reloadable and should not require an Electron restart for each new capability. The app shell and extension renderer surfaces share one design system, `@babymenu/ui` (`src/ui/`); see "Design system" below.
4. **Extension server actions and background tasks** - privileged filesystem, shell, network, credential, token, storage, notification, and background work should live behind extension-owned `server.ts` modules.
   Renderer widgets call these actions with `window.babyMenu.capabilities.invoke(extensionId, action, input)`.
   Server actions live in the active extension workspace under `<extension-id>/server.ts` and export an `actions` object; background tasks export `background` from the same file.
   Do not add per-widget IPC channels or preload methods.

Shared types live in `src/shared/contracts.ts` - `BabyMenuApi`, `BabyMenuWidget`, `BabyMenuSettingsSection`, `GitSessionSnapshot`, etc. The `Window.babyMenu` global is declared here.

The extension-facing slice of that contract is a generated public surface, treated like the preload bridge and `@babymenu/ui` (see "Design system"). Extensions cannot see `src/shared/contracts.ts` (it lives inside the app bundle, not in the extension workspace), so the host ships those types into the workspace as the `@babymenu/contracts` virtual module, declared in `extensions/babymenu-env.d.ts`. That `.d.ts` is generated from `contracts.ts` by `scripts/generate-extension-dts.mjs` (run `pnpm generate:contracts`); the selected names live in `src/shared/extension-contract-names.ts`, and `BabyMenuExtensionApi` is the window-bridge subset extensions may use. Do not hand-edit `extensions/babymenu-env.d.ts`. After changing any extension-facing type in `contracts.ts`, or the name list, regenerate and commit the result - `tests/extension-contract-surface.test.ts` and the `ci.yml` "Verify generated contract types are up to date" step both fail on a stale file. Extensions import these types with a type-only `import ... from "@babymenu/contracts"`, which the compiler erases and never validates against the runtime import allowlist; importing a value from that specifier is rejected. The committed `babymenu-env.d.ts` is intentionally tracked (not release-only) because typecheck, `pnpm dev`, and packaging all read it. Never tell an extension or its agent to reach back into `../../src/shared/contracts`; that relative path resolves in source mode but does not exist in a packaged install, and chasing it is what previously sent the embedded agent scanning protected home-directory folders.

`src/main/` module index:

- `app.ts` - Electron lifecycle, popover window creation, packaged path setup, extension seeding, preferences, selectable-agent catalog wiring, protocols, tray, and IPC. `package.json#main` points here via `out/main/index.js`.
- `app-paths.ts` - resolves source paths versus packaged `~/.baby-menu` paths.
- `tray.ts` - macOS tray icon and click handling (`createBabyMenuTray`).
- `popover.ts` - popover `BrowserWindow` options (`createPopoverOptions`), bounds math (`calculatePopoverBounds`), and renderer URL/file loading (`loadPopoverRenderer`).
- `ipc.ts` - registers all `ipcMain` handlers exposed via the preload bridge; the single place new generic IPC routes are added.
- `agent-catalog.ts` - defines built-in agents, parses custom `agents.json`, computes Settings availability, and builds `acpx` registry overrides.
- `agent-catalog-controller.ts` - owns the live agent catalog, validates Settings-added custom ACP agents, persists `agents.json`, and pushes refreshed registry overrides into the runtime without requiring an app restart.
- `agent-runtime.ts` - `BabyMenuAgentRuntime` wrapping `acpx/runtime`; gates every `send()` through a change session.
- `agent-turn-log.ts` - structured per-turn transcript log used by the renderer and tests.
- `git-change-session.ts` - the tracked-source Save/Rollback safety boundary (see below).
- `dev-extension-change-session.ts` - the snapshot Save/Rollback boundary for gitignored dev and packaged extension workspaces.
- `extension-seeder.ts` - self-heals the packaged extension workspace from the bundled template on every launch: it force-copies the shipped defaults (`AGENTS.md`, `babymenu-env.d.ts`, `recipes/`, and starter extensions) so a stale or edited managed file is restored, while leaving user-created extensions the template does not ship untouched (it never deletes them). Editing a managed default in `~/.baby-menu/extensions` therefore does not persist; change the source under `extensions/` instead.
- `extension-module-compiler.ts` - compiles extension widget and server modules for production loading; rewrites the `react` and `@babymenu/ui` imports to host protocol modules and rejects any other external import.
- `widget-tailwind-css.ts` - compiles a widget's authored Tailwind utilities against the `@babymenu/ui` `@theme` (single source of truth, `src/ui/theme.css`) for packaged loading.
- `widget-module-registry.ts` - discovers widget modules, returning a renderer `/@fs` URL in dev and, in packaged mode, a compiled `baby-menu-widget://` module URL plus a sibling compiled `cssUrl`.
- `widget-protocol.ts` - registers custom protocols for compiled widget modules, the per-widget `.css`, and the renderer host shims (`react`, `react/jsx-runtime`, and `@babymenu/ui` re-exported from the host global).
- `preferences.ts` - stores app preferences, including the selected agent, under the active app data root and applies login-item settings only when login items are allowed, keeping source/dev mode as a no-op for macOS login items.
- `shell-path.ts` - expands `PATH` for GUI launches so packaged apps can find agent CLIs.
- `update-checker.ts` - checks the latest GitHub Release at most every 4 hours, compares it to the running app version, opens the release page externally, and simulates an available update in source/dev mode so the header indicator can be exercised.
- `recipe-loader.ts` - discovers and parses `recipes/*.html` from the active extension workspace.
- `server-action-registry.ts` - discovers extension server actions and background task declarations from the active extension workspace, caches unchanged compiled server modules, and reloads them when the entry or local helper source changes.
- `background-task-scheduler.ts` - runs discovered extension background tasks on host-owned timers, hot-reloads changed tasks, and enforces the 60-second minimum interval.
- `extension-database.ts` - owns the shared local SQLite database exposed to extension server actions, background tasks, and widgets through the bridge.
- `notifier.ts` - backs `context.notify` for server actions and background tasks with native notifications.
- `telemetry.ts` - anonymous, best-effort usage telemetry to a self-hosted Umami instance. One fire-and-forget POST per event to `/api/send`, no user/device id and no prompt or file contents, every network error swallowed. The Umami host and website id are injected at build time by the `define` block in `electron.vite.config.ts` (CI release sets `BABY_MENU_UMAMI_HOST` inline and reads `BABY_MENU_UMAMI_WEBSITE_ID` from the `vars.*` Actions variable - not a secret, since the website id is sent in plaintext in every payload and baked into the shipped bundle); when unset (source/dev/test) the build website id is empty and the client is a no-op, so the app never phones home outside packaged release builds. `app.ts` initializes the default client and fires `app_start` and `popover_open`; `agent-runtime.ts` fires `agent_turn` (status `success` / `error` / `timeout` / `blocked_dirty`) and `agent_switch`. Set `BABY_MENU_TELEMETRY=0` (or `false`/`off`) to opt out, or override the target at runtime with `BABY_MENU_UMAMI_HOST` / `BABY_MENU_UMAMI_WEBSITE_ID`.

`src/adapters/` contains the bundled clean-room ACP adapters for built-in agents.
Claude Code and Codex are exposed to `acpx/runtime` as local adapter processes, while the adapters drive the real authenticated `claude` and `codex` CLIs in the active extension workspace.
The adapters intentionally run lean: they do not inherit user-level agent settings, skills, MCP servers, or extra rules.

`src/renderer/` extension loading modules:

- `extension-modules.ts` - shared runtime loader for extension `widget.tsx` modules, including dynamic import and packaged-mode stylesheet injection for widgets and settings sections.
- `settings/settings-sections.ts` - extracts `BabyMenuSettingsSection` exports from loaded extension modules and sorts them by extension id for stable Settings page order.

### Electron build wiring

`electron.vite.config.ts` has three roots:

- `main` entry: `src/main/app.ts` -> `out/main/index.js` (this is `package.json#main`).
- `preload` entry: `src/preload/index.ts` -> `out/preload/index.js`.
- `renderer` root: `src/renderer/` -> `out/renderer/`. In dev, main loads `process.env.ELECTRON_RENDERER_URL`; in production it loads `out/renderer/index.html` via `loadFile`.

`scripts/build-adapters.mjs` bundles `src/adapters/claude/index.ts` and `src/adapters/codex/index.ts` to `out/adapters/<name>/index.mjs` after `electron-vite build`.
`pnpm dev` runs the same adapter build before launching Electron because dev runtime paths also resolve adapters from `out/adapters/`.
Packaged builds keep `out/adapters/**` in `app.asar.unpacked` because adapter processes are spawned as standalone Node programs and cannot execute from inside `app.asar`.

`typescript` is intentionally externalized from the production main bundle because `extension-module-compiler.ts` imports it at runtime to compile packaged extensions.
Keep `typescript` in runtime dependencies unless that compiler path changes.
`tailwindcss`, `@tailwindcss/postcss`, and `postcss` are externalized for the same reason: `widget-tailwind-css.ts` runs Tailwind in the main process to compile per-widget CSS in packaged mode.
Keep them in runtime dependencies, and keep the single pinned `postcss` (`pnpm-workspace.yaml` `overrides`) so the Tailwind plugin and the processor share one version.
Universal macOS packages must run on both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs, so `pnpm-workspace.yaml` keeps Darwin `x64` and `arm64` native prebuilt dependencies installed, and `electron-builder.yml` `x64ArchFiles` must preserve architecture-specific native package files during the universal merge.
Keep `electron-builder` at `26.8.2` or newer; older releases can omit transitive dependencies from pnpm-deduped package trees and ship broken app bundles.
The renderer build adds `@tailwindcss/vite` and aliases `@babymenu/ui` to `src/ui/index.ts` so dev-mode widgets resolve the design system directly.

### Design system (`@babymenu/ui`)

`src/ui/` is a shadcn-derived component kit (Radix + Tailwind v4) restyled to the Monochrome Lab tokens, shared by the app shell and extension widgets.
`src/ui/theme.css` is the single `@theme` source of truth: it wipes Tailwind's default palette so only token colors exist, and it is consumed by both the renderer build (`src/ui/styles.css`) and the per-widget compiler (imported `?raw` into the main bundle).
Delivery mirrors the React shim exactly: `main.tsx` installs the kit on `window.__BABY_MENU_WIDGET_HOST__.ui`, `widget-protocol.ts` serves `baby-menu-host://ui/index.mjs` as a thin re-export, and the compiler rewrites the bare `@babymenu/ui` specifier to that URL - so Radix, cva, and lucide stay inside the host bundle and never reach the widget import allowlist.
`src/shared/ui-exports.ts` is the public surface contract (treated like the preload bridge): the barrel, the contract list, and the generated host shim are kept in lockstep by `tests/ui-export-contract.test.ts`, so changing a public export is a deliberate, tested act.
Extension widgets and settings sections may additionally import only `@babymenu/ui`; they author token-scoped Tailwind utilities, and the per-widget stylesheet is compiled and injected automatically.

`createPopoverOptions` enforces `frame:false`, `contextIsolation:true`, `nodeIntegration:false`, `skipTaskbar:true`, `alwaysOnTop:true`. Do not relax these without a reason.
On macOS, `app.ts` appends Chromium's `use-mock-keychain` switch before app readiness, so do not rely on Chromium or renderer storage for keychain-backed secrets.
Keep credential and token work in extension server actions.

### Agent runtime + change sessions

`BabyMenuAgentRuntime` (`src/main/agent-runtime.ts`) wraps `acpx/runtime`. It allows only one active `send()` call at a time; overlapping sends return an "already running" assistant response before any change session begins. The active agent comes from the persisted Settings choice, then `BABY_MENU_AGENT`, then catalog auto-detection. The catalog defaults to Claude Code and Codex, and may be extended by `agents.json` under the active app data root (`~/.baby-menu/agents.json` when packaged, repo-root `agents.json` in source mode). Built-in Claude Code and Codex entries are registered as `acpx` overrides that launch the bundled adapters, while availability still probes the wrapped local CLI (`claude` or `codex`). Settings can add, edit, and remove custom ACP agents by collecting a name, optional label, and launch command; those entries are persisted to `agents.json`, apply immediately through refreshed registry overrides, and remain editable/removable while built-ins stay read-only. Switching agents through Settings is blocked while an agent turn is running or while a change session can still be saved or rolled back; a successful switch closes the current persistent session with `discardPersistentState` so the next turn starts a fresh conversation.
Every accepted `send()` call:

1. Resolves the active extension workspace from runtime paths. Source mode honors `BABY_MENU_EXTENSIONS_DIR` or defaults to `extensions/`; packaged mode uses `~/.baby-menu/extensions` after seeding bundled templates. Dev/source Tailwind utility generation scans only `extensions/` and `extensions-dev/` unless `src/ui/styles.css` or `src/ui/styles.dev.css` is given an additional `@source` path, so custom overrides outside those directories may load widget modules without their utility CSS.
2. Uses `DevExtensionChangeSession` for snapshot workspaces such as `extensions-dev/` and packaged `~/.baby-menu/extensions`, so Save keeps generated files and Rollback restores the pre-turn contents.
3. Uses `GitChangeSession.begin(rootDir)` only for the tracked source `extensions/` workspace when that workspace is selected explicitly. If the working tree is dirty, it short-circuits and returns a refusal message instead of running the agent - this is intentional; do not bypass it for tracked edits.
4. Lazily constructs the ACP runtime with `createFileSessionStore({ stateDir })` under `.cache/baby-menu/acp-sessions` in source mode or `~/.baby-menu/cache/acp-sessions` in packaged mode, with `permissionMode: "approve-all"`.
5. Uses a fixed `sessionKey: "baby-menu-agent-chat"` so the agent has a single persistent conversation.

`GitChangeSession` (`src/main/git-change-session.ts`) is the safety boundary for Save/Rollback. Both operations refuse unless: the session started clean, the session is not already completed, and `HEAD` has not moved since the session began. `rollback()` runs `git reset --hard <recorded HEAD>` + `git clean -fd` - those destructive commands are only acceptable because of the preceding guards. Preserve this invariant.

Packaged runtime state lives under `~/.baby-menu` and is not git-backed.
Do not write generated extension files, the local extension database, compiled modules, preferences, logs, snapshots, or ACP session state into the `.app` bundle.

### Recipes and extensions

- Recipes are HTML files in `recipes/` inside the active extension workspace. `recipe-loader.ts` discovers `*.html`, sorts them, and extracts the title from `<title>` or first `<h1>`. They are intentionally HTML so the embedded agent can read them from its cwd and use embedded interactive demos.
- Extensions live in the active extension workspace under `<extension-id>/` and may include `widget.tsx`, `server.ts`, and local helper files.
- Packaged widgets, settings sections, and server actions are compiled into `~/.baby-menu/cache` and loaded through custom protocols or cached modules; dev mode keeps Vite `/@fs` loading for renderer modules.
- Widgets conform to `BabyMenuWidget` / `RefreshableBabyMenuWidget`. The `WidgetHost` owns visible-widget refresh timing via `useViewRefresh`, using the main-process popover visibility signal - widgets should not start their own polling.
- Settings sections conform to `BabyMenuSettingsSection`, are exported from `widget.tsx`, and own only the section body; `SettingsView` owns the frame and rediscovers sections when settings refresh or the popover reopens.
- New widgets and capabilities should be built as self-contained extensions behind the stable `window.babyMenu` bridge.
- Extension server actions and background tasks are discovered dynamically from the active extension workspace, so new or changed capabilities can be picked up without changing preload.
- Server action modules keep one module instance while `server.ts` and its local imports are unchanged, so module-scope state can survive repeated `invoke` calls and background ticks.
- That state is reset on code edits and app restarts; durable extension state belongs in the shared SQLite store, not module scope.
- Use `viewRefreshIntervalMs` / `refreshView` for live data that only matters while the popover is visible, and use background tasks only for work that must keep running while the popover is closed.
- Extension data that should persist locally belongs in the shared SQLite store, exposed as `context.db` server-side and `window.babyMenu.db` renderer-side; keep heavy queries out of widgets.
- The embedded agent should be steered toward editing its active extension workspace. The Electron core in `src/main/`, `src/preload/`, and shared IPC wiring is meant to be boring infrastructure.

### Recipe authoring best practices

- Recipes must be self-contained implementation specs.
- Do not tell the agent to inspect another repository, website, blog post, or external implementation guide before it can implement the recipe.
- It is fine to mention inspiration or provenance, but copy the actionable details into the recipe itself: commands, endpoints, local file paths, parser expectations, fallback order, security notes, IPC shape, files to edit, live verification steps, and acceptance criteria.
- A recipe should let an agent implement the feature from the recipe plus this repo alone.
- Each recipe should include a clear capability statement, expected user-facing behavior, recommended data-source order, implementation contract, error handling, security constraints, interactive demo, and acceptance criteria.
- For privileged work, explicitly say that filesystem, shell, network, credential, and token access belongs in extension-owned server actions behind `window.babyMenu.capabilities.invoke`.
- For durable local data, explicitly say whether the widget should read directly from `window.babyMenu.db`, whether a server action should use `context.db`, or whether a background task should persist data for later widget reads.
- For ongoing work, explicitly distinguish visible-widget refresh from background tasks and require the slowest acceptable interval.
- Renderer widgets and settings sections should receive normalized data over `window.babyMenu` and should not add new preload methods for each capability.
- If a real data source may be unavailable, require an explicit unavailable or sign-in-required result rather than a mock fallback; recipes should use real data only and must not fabricate or silently substitute mock data. Only specify labeled sample data when the user explicitly asks for examples.
- Define normalized TypeScript shapes in the recipe so the agent knows what data extension server actions should return to widgets.
- Include parser guidance for command or API output, including timeout behavior, stale-data behavior, and user-visible errors.
- Never include or ask for committed secrets, tokens, cookie values, or local credential dumps.
- Standalone recipe HTML should use daisyUI from CDN and the `wireframe` theme.
- Include these tags in recipe HTML: `<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/daisyui@5" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />`, `<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/daisyui@5/themes.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />`, and `<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@tailwindcss/browser@4"></script>`.
- Set `<html data-theme="wireframe">` on recipe pages.
- Avoid custom `<style>` blocks in recipes unless there is a specific interaction that cannot be expressed with daisyUI and Tailwind utilities.
- Keep recipe typography readable: use a bounded content width such as `max-w-4xl`, body copy around `text-base`, comfortable `leading-7`, clear heading hierarchy, restored bullet and numbered list styles, and smaller text for code and tables.
- Prefer daisyUI components such as `card`, `table`, `btn`, `progress`, and `mockup-code` for recipe structure and demos instead of hand-written CSS.
- When changing recipe conventions, update `tests/recipe-loader.test.ts` so the convention is protected by regression tests.

## Conventions

- TDD is required for bug fixes and new features (skip only for docs / metadata / ephemeral artifacts). Tests live in `tests/` at the repo root, not co-located.
- TypeScript is strict; `moduleResolution: "Bundler"`, ESM (`"type": "module"`). Tests use Vitest with `vitest/globals` types.
- Never auto-add agent co-author lines to commit messages.
- Avoid em dashes; use plain `-`.
