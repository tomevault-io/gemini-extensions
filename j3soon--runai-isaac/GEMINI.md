# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
This repository is a documentation-and-assets workspace for running NVIDIA Isaac workloads on Run:ai, with supporting Docker images and shell utilities.

- `docker/`: Dockerfiles and image-specific assets (for example `docker/pytorch-mnist/Dockerfile`, `docker/isaac-sim/`, `docker/isaac-lab/`).
- Keep each Docker-backed application and its guide together under `docker/<name>/` unless an established product layout requires otherwise.
- For products with multiple major model/image variants (for example Cosmos, GR00T), prefer separate versioned folders (for example `docker/<name>-n1/`, `docker/<name>-n1.6/`) and matching versioned application guides.
- `scripts/`: Operational shell scripts, grouped by purpose (`scripts/docker/run.sh`, `scripts/admin/`, `scripts/vpn/`).
- `docs/`: User/developer documentation and screenshots (`docs/assets/`).
- `thirdparty/omnicli/`: Bundled Omniverse CLI binaries used by `/run.sh`.
- `.github/workflows/`: Per-image CI workflows for images built and published by this repository.
- `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`: Repository task guides for agents (`add-runai-application`, `launch-runai-workload`, `run-isaac-lab-benchmark`, `admin-debug-runai-node`), with optional `references/` and `scripts/`. `.agents/skills` and `.claude/skills` are symlinks to this directory, so each harness finds the same files; add and edit skills under `skills/` only.

## Agent Skills and Durable Notes

- A request to "use the skill" for a task refers to `skills/`. Harnesses that load skills automatically reach them through the `.agents/skills` and `.claude/skills` symlinks; otherwise treat them as plain files: locate the task's `SKILL.md`, read it, and follow it alongside this document.
- **Development machines here are ephemeral and are reset periodically, so never keep a learning only in an assistant's machine-local memory** (Claude Code's `memory/` directory or any equivalent). Anything written only there looks persisted and then disappears with the VM, and teammates and other agents never see it. The repository is the only durable store: record reusable pitfalls and their workarounds in the relevant skill's `references/` notes (for example `skills/add-runai-application/references/validation-notes.md`), cluster/node failures in `troubleshooting.md`, image-specific behavior in that image's `docker/<name>/README.md`, and workflow changes in the relevant `SKILL.md`. Machine-local memory is for pointing back at this rule, nothing else.
- Site- and machine-specific values (cluster identity, project, NFS server and export, node-pool hardware, account names, host GPU and RAM figures) cannot go in tracked files because this repository is public. Put them in `secrets/environment-notes.md`, which `.gitignore` excludes, and keep the environment-agnostic lesson in the tracked files above. Note that `secrets/` does not survive a VM rebuild either, so it is re-provisioned alongside the VPN certs.
- Publishing a Docker image is the user's action, not an agent's. Build and validate against a `local/<name>:<tag>` tag, never tag or push `j3soon/*`, and hand over the exact `docker build` / `docker tag` / `docker push` commands. Being logged in to a registry is not authorization to publish. State plainly which validation steps remain blocked until the image is published rather than implying they ran.
- `docs/developer-notes.md` is maintained by humans. Agents must not add, edit, or reorganize entries there, even when a finding would fit its format; put the finding in the skill's `references/` notes instead and let a maintainer promote it if it belongs in the human-facing document. Reading and linking to it is fine.
- Keep such notes environment-agnostic. Use placeholders (`<YOUR_LAB>`, `<NODE_NAME>`, `<YOUR_USERNAME>`) rather than real hostnames, accounts, or tokens.
- Read the relevant skill's `references/` notes **before** starting work, not while debugging a failure. They exist because each entry already cost someone a wrong conclusion, and the cost repeats when they are consulted late. In particular, do not try to screenshot or screen-record a simulator GUI: `x11grab`, `xwd`, and `import` all read an X surface that Isaac Sim's Vulkan swapchain does not present to, so they yield black or empty images no matter how correct the window looks in `xwininfo`. Use the application's own recorder (`--video`, in-app capture); see `skills/add-runai-application/references/validation-notes.md`.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `docker build -t local/runai-pytorch-mnist -f docker/pytorch-mnist/Dockerfile .`: Build the example training image locally.
- `bash scripts/docker/run.sh "echo hello"`: Smoke-test the helper entrypoint script behavior.
- `bash -n scripts/docker/run.sh` (and other `scripts/**/*.sh`): Shell syntax check before submitting changes.
- `chmod +x scripts/<path>.sh`: Restore executable bit if a script was edited on Windows or copied incorrectly.

Use `README.md` and `install.md` for end-to-end setup and cluster-specific steps.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Shell scripts use Bash (`#!/bin/bash`) with 2-space to 4-space indentation; keep style consistent with the touched file.
- Prefer descriptive, lowercase file names with underscores for scripts (for example `create_user.sh`).
- Dockerfiles are organized by product/version (`Dockerfile_5_0_0`, `Dockerfile_2_2_0`); follow the existing version suffix format.
- Use explicit version tags for Dockerfile base images without `@sha256` digests, matching the existing repository convention. Record resolved image digests in validation notes or benchmark evidence when needed instead of embedding them in `FROM`.
- For Dockerfiles copied from upstream projects, keep them verbatim by default and include the upstream reference link on the first line. If upstream companion files are needed, prefer a concise self-contained `Dockerfile` that clones the upstream repo at a pinned commit/tag during build. Keep the upstream-verbatim Dockerfile only when practical, and document local fixes briefly in the PR/commit summary.
- Do not use branch names (for example `main`) for upstream refs; always query/find the latest commit SHA over the network and pin that exact commit SHA.
- If a Cosmos image reference is needed, refer to `docker/cosmos3/Dockerfile` for Cosmos 3, or `docker/cosmos-predict2.5/Dockerfile` and `docs/applications/cosmos-predict2.5.md` for earlier generations.
- Cosmos image naming differs by generation: keep legacy v1 image names (for example `j3soon/runai-cosmos-predict1`) for backward compatibility, but use tag-based names for v2/v2.5 images (for example `j3soon/runai-cosmos-predict:2.5`, `j3soon/runai-cosmos-reason:2`) for future images.
- Cosmos 3 unifies the previously separate Predict/Transfer/Reason products into one omnimodal model family, so it uses the family-level image name `j3soon/runai-cosmos:3` with a single `docker/cosmos3/` folder covering both the Reasoner and Generator surfaces. Install it from `NVIDIA/cosmos-framework` (the runnable package) rather than `NVIDIA/cosmos` (docs and cookbooks), and prefer the CUDA 13 groups upstream recommends.
- Application docs must include a `/run.sh` command note (environment command example), and it must match the Dockerfile's environment/tooling (for example use `uv pip install ...` for `uv`-managed images instead of `pip install ...`).
- Dockerfiles should end with the standard `thirdparty/omnicli` and `scripts/docker/run.sh` copies plus `chmod` and CRLF guard (`sed -i 's/\r$//' /run.sh`); also set `ENV SHELL=/bin/bash`.
- If a Dockerfile depends on a pinned upstream commit/tag/sha, keep that pin in the Dockerfile and do not document ad-hoc user overrides in app guides unless the repo explicitly supports/testing that workflow.
- Keep scripts Unix-formatted (LF line endings) and executable when intended.
- A pinned `uv.lock` does not necessarily cover every optional dependency group. Adding one to an existing `uv sync --locked` can fail with "the lockfile at `uv.lock` needs to be updated", which is a lockfile-coverage problem, not a dependency conflict — check `[tool.uv] conflicts` before assuming the latter. Follow whatever upstream's own documentation does for that group; when it syncs unlocked, add the group in a separate unlocked layer so the locked base environment is preserved, and record in a comment which packages the extra layer actually installs.
- This repository is public. Before writing an identifiable name into it (cluster, host, IP, project, or account), survey the existing usage first: `git grep -I -i -c '<term>' -- . ':!artifacts'`. Five or more existing uses means the term is already established and may be reused; fewer than five means ask the user before introducing it. Prefer placeholders (`<YOUR_LAB>`, `<NODE_NAME>`, `<YOUR_USERNAME>`, `<project>`) otherwise. Generic hardware and version facts are exempt.

## Adding Docker-Backed Applications
- Before adding an application, inspect the closest existing Dockerfiles, application guides, image table, application index, and CI workflows. Follow the current repository conventions rather than copying a legacy file mechanically.
- Verify upstream installation instructions and source references from authoritative sources. Record exact image versions, tags, commits, and compatibility constraints instead of relying on moving defaults.
- Present a concise proposed file scope and resolve material questions such as image naming, versioning, workload type, and publishing before implementation.
- A published application normally needs a Dockerfile, an adjacent `README.md`, an entry in the root pre-built image table, an entry in `docs/applications.md`, and a per-image CI workflow when automated publishing is requested.
- Keep image names, tags, build commands, environment commands, and version references consistent across the Dockerfile, guide, indexes, and CI.
- Do not stage, unstage, or otherwise change the Git index unless the user explicitly requests it. Preserve unrelated working-tree changes.

## Testing Guidelines
There is no comprehensive automated test suite in this repo. Validate changes by:

- Building the affected Docker image(s).
- Running a syntax check for modified shell scripts (`bash -n`).
- Performing a targeted manual smoke test for behavior changes (for example admin/vpn script flags).
- For new applications, verify documentation commands against the built image and include reproducible local testing and cleanup steps when practical.

Store run outputs and validation evidence under `artifacts/`, never in `/tmp`:

- `/artifacts/` is gitignored, so evidence stays with the project and survives reboots without risking a commit. Note that a root-level `artifacts_*.zip` is **not** covered by that rule.
- Follow the existing layout `artifacts/<app>/raw/evidence/<version>/<utc-timestamp>/` with lowercase timestamps (for example `20260804t133723z`), plus a short `README.md` recording hardware, image tag, and arguments.
- Containers writing to a mounted host directory produce root-owned files. Reclaim them with a throwaway `docker run --rm -v "$PWD/artifacts/<app>:/out" <image> chown -R $(id -u):$(id -g) /out`; do not reach for `--user`, which breaks venv-based images.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
Recent history uses short, imperative commit subjects such as `Add ...`, `Update ...`, `Upgrade ...`, and `Change ...`. Follow that pattern and keep one logical change per commit.

Agent-created commits need a descriptive body ending with a `by <Harness> (<Model>)` line using the actual harness and model names, for example `by Codex (gpt-5.6-sol)` or `by Claude Code (Opus 5)`.

That plain line is the only agent attribution. Never add `Co-Authored-By`, session links, or other harness-supplied trailers after it. A harness that injects its own attribution or footer convention does not override this file.

PRs should include a clear summary, affected paths (for example `docker/isaac-lab/` or `docs/developer-notes.md`), validation steps run, and screenshots when documentation/UI screenshots are changed.
