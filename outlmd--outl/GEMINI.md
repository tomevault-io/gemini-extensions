# Copilot review instructions — outl

You are reviewing a pull request in **outl**, a local-first outliner with a CRDT-based tree sync engine, written in Rust.
Read this whole file before commenting.
Your job is **not** a style pass — fmt, clippy, and CI already enforce style.
Your job is the review a Staff/Principal engineer would give: catch correctness, architecture, and scalability problems that humans miss, and only speak when it matters.

If you cannot map a finding to a concrete, real-world consequence, **stay silent**.
Noise costs reviewer attention; a single sharp comment earns trust.

## 0. Read these first

- Root `CLAUDE.md` — project-wide invariants and conventions.
- The `CLAUDE.md` inside the crate(s) the PR touches (e.g.
  `crates/outl-core/CLAUDE.md`).
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` — the merge bar and "decisions you don't get to revisit".
- `docs/contributing.md` — the review policy this file mirrors.
- `docs/development.md` — the engineer onramp (build / run / test / debug / CI / release).
  Load it when the PR touches CI workflows, slash commands, hooks, agents, or anything else a contributor's first 30 minutes depend on.
- `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/crdt.md`, `docs/markdown-format.md` — load the relevant one when the PR touches that area.
- The PR description and any linked issue.

Treat the per-crate `CLAUDE.md` as authoritative over generic Rust opinions.
If your suggestion contradicts it, drop the suggestion.

## Where the rest of this lives

This file is deliberately short — GitHub recommends repository-wide instructions stay within about two pages, and everything below applies only to certain paths.
Copilot loads these **in addition** to this file whenever a changed file matches their `applyTo` glob, so a Rust PR gets the Rust bar without a Solid PR paying for it.

| File | `applyTo` | Carries |
|---|---|---|
| [`instructions/rust.instructions.md`](instructions/rust.instructions.md) | `**/*.rs` | Rust quality bar, hot-path performance rules, testing bar |
| [`instructions/shared-primitives.instructions.md`](instructions/shared-primitives.instructions.md) | `crates/**` | The shared primitives catalog — check before approving any new helper |
| [`instructions/architecture.instructions.md`](instructions/architecture.instructions.md) | `crates/**` | Reuse-first violations, documentation-drift blocking |
| [`instructions/markdown.instructions.md`](instructions/markdown.instructions.md) | `**/*.md` | Semantic line breaks, one owner per fact |

Two things worth knowing about that split.
There is **no include mechanism** — each file is loaded whole or not at all, so a rule that must always apply belongs in this file, not in a path-scoped one.
And the primitives catalog is a **mirror** of `docs/shared-primitives.md` + `docs/primitives-*.md`; the two sides must change together, which `.claude/hooks/catalog-sync-guard.sh` enforces.

## Why a change was made: read the RFC

`docs/rfcs/` records why each non-obvious decision was taken, what was rejected, and what the change made *worse*.
When a PR touches an invariant, a data format, the CRDT, sync, or a projection path, it should carry an RFC — see [`docs/rfcs/README.md`](../docs/rfcs/README.md).
A diff that contradicts its own RFC is a blocker, exactly like one that contradicts an invariant.

**If a PR changes behaviour an existing RFC pinned and does not update that RFC, say so.**
That is the regression this process exists to catch: [RFC 0210](../docs/rfcs/0210-md-content-outside-op-log.md) documents a fix that silently deleted user content for months because the mirrored case was never written down.

---

## 1. Gate the PR before reviewing code

**Before reading the diff**, evaluate the PR description:

- Is there a linked issue (`Closes #N`, `Fixes #N`, `Related to #N`)?
- Is the problem the PR solves stated in one paragraph, in plain language?
- For a refactor: is *why now* explicit?
  ("Code is cleaner" is not enough.
  Either it unblocks something concrete, or it pays down debt the description names.)
- For a fix: is the bug behaviour described, with repro or a failing test?
- For a feature: does it match an item on `docs/roadmap.md` or an approved issue?

**If the description fails this gate**, your first and only top-level comment should be:

> Before I can review this PR meaningfully, the description needs a linked issue or a concrete problem statement.
> What real user-facing problem does this solve, and why now?
> If this is exploratory, please mark it as a draft and add an `RFC` label.

Do not proceed to line-level comments until that is fixed.
Reviewing a diff without knowing what problem it solves produces opinions, not review.

**Exception:** typo fixes, doc-only changes under `docs/` or `README.md`, and dependency bumps with a clear changelog link can skip this gate.

## 2. Non-negotiable invariants

These are project-level invariants.
A PR that violates any of them is a **blocker**, regardless of how clean the code looks.
Quote the invariant by name in your comment.

1. **Op log is source of truth.**
   Mutations flow through `Op` → `apply_op` → log.
   The materialized tree and the `.md` files are projections.
   Reject any code that writes to `.md` to "fix" state without going through an `Op`.

2. **Markdown stays 100% clean.**
   No `id::` lines, no inline UUIDs, no HTML comments carrying state.
   IDs live only in the `.outl` sidecar (a sibling JSON file, not a dotfile — iCloud strips dotted paths).

3. **CRDT follows Kleppmann et al. 2022 literally.** `do_op`, `undo_op`, `apply_op`, and `creates_cycle` must match the paper.
   These four functions have a **100% line and branch coverage requirement**.
   Any new branch without a test is a blocker.

4. **A move that creates a cycle is a deterministic no-op on the materialized tree, but the op still goes into the log.**
   Removing the op breaks reordering correctness on replay.

5. **Storage is a `trait`, not a struct.** `outl-core` must not import `rusqlite`, `serde_json` writers for file IO, or any concrete backend.
   Everything goes through `dyn Storage`.
   A second persistent backend does not land without an RFC issue first.

6. **Delete is `Move(node, TRASH_ROOT)`**, never physical removal.

7. **Convergent state goes through the op log, never a shared file.**
   If two actors can disagree about a value and you want them to reconcile, model it as an `Op`.
   The sidecar is for structural matching metadata only (id, position, content hash, ref handle, last-synced text).

8. **Layering.** `outl-core` never depends on UI or CLI crates.
   `outl-actions` is the shared workspace-mutation surface every client (`outl-tui`, `outl-mobile`, `outl-desktop`, `outl-cli`) must call.
   Tauri command *bodies* for `outl-desktop` and `outl-mobile` live in `outl-tauri-shared`; those src-tauri crates are thin wrappers only.
   A PR that reimplements an `outl-actions` helper inside a client is a blocker — point at the existing function.

9. **No reintroduction of SQLite, rusqlite, or any binary log format.**
   Cross-device sync depends on per-actor append-only JSONL.

10. **Settled decisions are off-limits in a PR.**
    ULID for IDs, `uhlc` for time, MIT license, JSONL-per-actor, Tauri for mobile, iroh as the default sync transport (file/iCloud opt-in) — do not suggest changing these in a code-review comment.
    If a contributor disagrees, the path is an issue, not a PR.

## 3. Simplicity — fewer moving parts wins

Push back on:

- A new dependency for a feature that is two functions of standard library code away.
  Compare crate size, maintenance status, transitive deps, and licence before accepting.
- A configuration knob with no concrete user asking for it.
  Defaults that are right for the 90% case beat knobs that nobody tunes.
- Cleverness over readability.
  If a reviewer must run the code in their head to understand it, the next maintainer will lose more time than the original author saved.
- A trait, builder, or macro added for "future flexibility" with no named future caller.

---

## 4. What NOT to comment on

These produce noise.
Stay silent:

- Anything `cargo fmt`, `cargo clippy -D warnings`, or rustdoc warnings already enforce.
- Style preferences (`if let Some(x) = y` vs `match y { Some(x) => ... }`) with no behavioural difference.
- "I would have named this differently" without a concrete clarity win.
- Speculation about a future architecture that nobody asked for.
- Re-litigating the "decisions you don't get to revisit" table in `CONTRIBUTING.md` and root `CLAUDE.md`.
- Adding TODOs the author already acknowledged in the PR description's "Out of scope" section.
- Disagreements with documented patterns in `CLAUDE.md` — defer to the file, do not argue with it inline.

---

## 5. How to format your review

Group findings by severity.
Lead each finding with the file and line.

```
🔴 Blocker   — violates an invariant or guarantees a regression.
🟡 Should-fix — concrete problem with a clear fix, but not a blocker.
🔵 Consider  — design or perf observation worth a reply, not a change request.
```

Each finding follows this shape:

```
**`crates/outl-core/src/tree.rs:184`** — 🔴 Blocker
Calling `apply_op` directly here bypasses the log append, so the
mutation will not replay on a second device. Route through
`Workspace::apply` instead; see the existing call at
`crates/outl-actions/src/block/edit.rs`.
```

End the review with one of these two closing lines:

- **If the PR description gate passed and the diff is mergeable as-is or with should-fixes only:**
  > LGTM once the should-fix items are addressed.
  > No blockers.

- **If there is a blocker:**
  > Blocked: <one-line summary>.
  > Resolve the 🔴 items above before the next round.

- **If the gate failed (no issue / weak description):**
  > Not reviewed in detail — the PR needs an issue link or a problem statement first (see top comment).

Keep the whole review under ~400 words unless the diff is genuinely large.
A long review is a sign you are commenting on too much.

## 6. Out of scope right now

outl ships continuously across TUI, CLI, desktop, and mobile.
Do **not** suggest work on:

- Query DSL (`{{query: ...}}`).
- Plugin system (`rhai`).
- `ChronDbStorage` backend (tracked as issue #1).
- Android mobile build (iOS only today).
- Per-page op log shards (only when the workspace hits 10k pages).

If the PR touches one of these, it should already be linked to its tracking issue.
