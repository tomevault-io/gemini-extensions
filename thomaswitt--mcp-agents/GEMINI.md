# mcp-agents

MCP server that wraps AI CLI tools (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Codex CLI) as MCP tools for any MCP client.

## Architecture

The primary ESM server lives in `server.js`; there is no build step or
transpilation. `CLI_BACKENDS` defines the blocking Claude/Gemini commands,
while browser and the default Codex provider have dedicated proxy/adapter
runtimes. The deprecated native MCP implementation is sealed in
`codex-legacy.js` and loaded only for `--provider codex-legacy`, making its
eventual removal one explicit provider/module boundary. Version is read from
`package.json` at runtime via `readFileSync` (not import assertions — the syntax
shifted across Node versions and the runtime read sidesteps that entirely).

## Commands

```sh
# Run server
node server.js --provider claude   # or: gemini, codex (default), codex-legacy

# Tests (fast, no real CLI calls)
SKIP_INTEGRATION=1 ./test.sh

# Tests (full, calls real CLIs — requires claude/gemini/codex installed)
./test.sh

# Verify CLI flags
node server.js --help
node server.js --version
```

## Local Install

```sh
npm install && npm link
```

`.tool-versions` pins the checkout's Node for mise. `npm link` puts `mcp-agents`
in the *active* Node's global prefix, so switching Node versions orphans the
link — re-run `npm link` if `mcp-agents` disappears from `$PATH`.

## Critical: stdout is MCP-only

NEVER write to stdout in server mode — it's the MCP JSON-RPC transport. Use `logErr()` (writes to stderr) for all logging. `console.log` is only safe in `printHelp()` / `parseArgs()` which call `process.exit()` before the server starts.

## Gotchas

- `package.json` must stay in the `files` array — the server reads it at runtime for `VERSION`
- Child process stdin must be closed immediately (`child.stdin?.end()`) or the CLI hangs waiting for EOF
- The `keepAlive` interval prevents premature exit when stdin EOF arrives before async handlers complete
- `engines` requires `>=26` — raised in 0.28.0 so the browser provider's downstream floor is always satisfied. Older providers ran on 18; do not reintroduce a lower floor without checking `chrome-devtools-mcp`
- `codex` and `codex-legacy` are intentionally separate providers with no
  automatic fallback. `codex` owns the App Server migration and all new Codex
  functionality. `codex-legacy.js` must preserve the complete 0.28 native
  `codex mcp-server` behavior while that upstream command remains supported;
  do not partially reimplement it, route it through App Server, or add App
  Server-only tools/state semantics. Removing the legacy provider later must
  be an explicit breaking change
- Keep `codex-legacy.js` self-contained except for its narrow exported runner.
  Deliberate helper duplication is the deletion boundary, not an invitation to
  couple legacy framing/auth/job behavior back into the App adapter. Its
  private homes remain under `${STARTUP_CWD}/tmp/codex-homes/` for exact
  compatibility; do not silently move them into App durable state
- The `codex` provider is a wrapper-owned MCP server over the documented, version-gated stdio JSONL surface of `codex app-server`; it is NOT a native MCP pass-through. Outer `initialize`, `tools/list`, `ping`, validation, progress, jobs, and local state tools must stay independent of child availability. Never forward raw App Server frames to MCP stdout and never initialize with `experimentalApi`
- Codex tools expose closed wrapper-owned schemas. `codex` requires `prompt`, an **absolute** `cwd`, and `sandbox`, with optional curated model/effort, `allow_subagents`, and native `goal`; `codex-reply` requires `prompt` plus nonblank `threadId`. App Server config/filesystem methods, raw instructions, providers, reply execution settings, and per-call approval policy remain hidden. Validation errors are redacted MCP `-32602` responses and never reach App Server
- App Server children are lazy and generation-scoped. Every pending native request, interaction, and turn carries its generation; late frames from a dead generation are ignored. A child exit rejects already-dispatched turns as `codex_outcome_unknown`, records that state in the sidecar, and NEVER replays them. Only a later safe operation may spawn the next generation
- Completion authority is the stable `turn/completed` notification plus completed `agentMessage` / `exitedReviewMode` items. Deltas are presentation-only. Preserve exactly one MCP result, retain the durable `threadId`, and treat `interrupted` / `failed` as errors even if partial agent text exists
- Durable Codex state is external and project-scoped at `${XDG_STATE_HOME:-$HOME/.local/state}/mcp-agents/codex/projects/<sha256(canonical STARTUP_CWD)>/v1` unless overridden. The allowlist is `sessions/`, `archived_sessions/`, native `thread-writer-locks/`, the native goal store, wrapper `leases/`, retention metadata, and content-free `bridges/` sidecars. Reject roots inside the served workspace, set umask `0077`, and keep directories `0700` / files `0600`
- `owner.json` and `active-turns.json` are the external liveness contract. They may expose bridge/child PIDs, generation, thread/turn IDs, cwd, sandbox, timestamps, rollout path, and only these states: `starting|active|waiting_for_input|canceling|terminal_undelivered|outcome_unknown`. They MUST NOT contain prompts, commentary, model output, reasoning, command data, or private native request IDs. Write them atomically and fail liveness toward uncertainty
- Wrapper per-thread leases reject a live OR uncertain competing owner and recover only a PID-proven-dead stale lease. Codex's native writer-lock directory is shared unchanged; do not delete its lock files manually. Turns, reviews, goals, forks, and archive operations on one thread must not race across bridge processes
- Sessions and archived sessions persist across bridge reconnects. Retention defaults to 30 days, runs at startup and daily, and may delete only an inactive, confidently owned old thread after goal cleanup and native `thread/delete`; live or uncertain bridges, leases, sidecars, malformed journals, and partial failures must defer deletion. Background job records remain connection-local
- Native goals use `thread/goal/set|get|clear`, not prompt injection. On POSIX, share the documented `goals_1.sqlite` layout into isolated `CODEX_SQLITE_HOME` without pinning it to an exact Codex patch release; the README owns this compatibility assumption. Preserve SQLite's proven main-DB symlink behavior and validate/chmod the canonical DB, WAL, and SHM opportunistically
- App Server approvals and structured questions are server-initiated JSON-RPC requests. Approval policy stays server-owned (`never` by default); unexpected approvals under `never` interrupt the turn. Use wrapper interaction IDs, reject secret questions without queueing/logging, resolve once, and cap waiting by the lesser of ten minutes and the turn's remaining hard deadline. Foreground MCP elicitation is allowed only when the client advertises form elicitation; background work falls back to `codex-interactions` / `codex-interaction-resolve`
- `codex-peek` is strictly read-only with respect to observed turns: it starts nothing, arms no observed-turn timer, never returns prompts/model output/commentary or private native IDs, and never converts unknown into absent. A `cwd` filter reports rather than hides a row whose workspace is unknown. The App Server child is multiplexed, so a process-table search cannot prove a particular turn finished
- Native subagents are OFF by default and session-scoped. `allow_subagents: true` enables only Codex's in-process multi-agent gates for that initial thread; replies inherit it. The isolated config still strips external MCP servers and custom roles, so enabled subagents cannot re-enter this bridge or reach Claude/Gemini. They share the thread sandbox and approval policy, so shared-workspace concurrency remains the caller's risk
- Isolated `CODEX_HOME` / `CODEX_SQLITE_HOME` generations copy `auth.json` and `models_cache.json`, selectively mirror only explicit Fast mode, and keep unrelated config, MCP servers, logs, and general SQLite state private. Auth write-back stays conflict-guarded; invalidated, unchanged, or canonically superseded auth must not overwrite the user's current login
- Cancellation maps to `turn/interrupt` and remains best-effort: settling a request is not proof a write-capable turn stopped. Per-request faults must not tear down sibling turns. Client EOF cancels connection-local jobs/open turns and boundedly reaps the App Server group, while durable sessions remain resumable

## Testing

`test.sh` uses bash helpers that pipe JSON-RPC to the server over stdio. CLI flag tests (`test_cli_flag`, `test_cli_error`) run first, then protocol tests. The sourceable `test-codex-legacy.sh` fragment owns the complete frozen native MCP regression suite; removing the provider means removing that fragment as one unit. All tests use `timeout`/`gtimeout` to cap execution since the keepAlive timer prevents natural exit.

## Changelog

Maintain `CHANGELOG.md` following [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) format. Every user-facing change must have an entry before release.

## Releasing a New Version

1. Update version in `package.json`
2. Add entry to `CHANGELOG.md`
3. Run `npm install` to sync `package-lock.json`
4. Run tests: `SKIP_INTEGRATION=1 ./test.sh`
5. Commit: `git commit -m "<see commit message instructions below"`
6. Tag: `git tag -a v0.x.y -m "v0.x.y"`
7. Push: `git push --follow-tags` (only allowed manually)
8. Publish: `npm publish` (only allowed manually)

## Style

- Follow existing patterns in `server.js` — switch statements for CLI parsing, Promise wrappers for child_process
- Keep new implementation in `server.js` unless there is a strong reason to
  split it. `codex-legacy.js` is the deliberate compatibility/deletion boundary,
  not a general second home for shared features
