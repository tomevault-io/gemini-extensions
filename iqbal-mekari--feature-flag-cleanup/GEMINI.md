## feature-flag-cleanup

> Clean up feature flags from codebases. Removes flag checks, makes conditional code unconditional (graduate = keep enabled code, drop = remove enabled code), handles cascade cleanup via static analysis, cleans tests/config/docs. Use when the user wants to clean up, remove, graduate, drop, retire, or sunset a feature flag.

## Input Requirements

Before starting, the skill MUST collect these inputs from the user:

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Flag name** | ✅ | The string identifier (e.g., `flag_mod_xpm_travel`) |
| **Action** | ✅ | `graduate` (keep enabled code) or `drop` (remove enabled code) |
| **Repository path** | ✅ | Path to the repository to clean |

### Action Definitions

- **Graduate** → The feature is permanently enabled. Remove the flag check, KEEP the code inside the `true`/enabled branch. Delete the `false`/disabled branch.
- **Drop** → The feature is being removed. Remove the flag check, DELETE the code inside the `true`/enabled branch. Keep the `false`/disabled/fallback branch.

---

## Execution Steps

### Phase 1: Discovery

> Discovery is reliable because flags are ALWAYS defined as string constants in a dedicated constants file per module. No confirmation checkpoint needed — proceed directly to transformation.

1. **Find the flag constant definition**
   - `grep` for the flag name string literal (e.g., `"flag_mod_xpm_travel"`) across the repository
   - This will locate the constant file/class (e.g., `FlagConstants.dart`, `FeatureFlags.kt`, `FeatureFlags.swift`)
   - Note the constant variable name (e.g., `kFlagModXpmTravel`, `FLAG_MOD_XPM_TRAVEL`)

2. **Trace all references via the constant name**
   - `grep` for the constant variable name across the entire repo (including `android/` and `ios/` directories for Flutter projects)
   - This gives the complete and exhaustive list of usage sites

3. **Categorize usages** (for transformation routing)
   - **Code conditionals**: if/else, ternary, switch, widget conditional rendering → Phase 2
   - **Config/registry entries**: flag registration, default value definitions → Phase 4
   - **Test references**: test mocks, test setup, flag-specific test cases → Phase 5
   - **Documentation**: comments, README references, changelog entries → Phase 6

4. **Proceed immediately** — no user confirmation needed. Results shown in PR.

### Phase 2: Code Transformation

For each code conditional usage, apply the correct transformation based on the action:

- **Graduate** → keep the `true`/enabled branch, remove the `false`/disabled branch
- **Drop** → keep the `false`/disabled branch, remove the `true`/enabled branch

> **📖 See [cleanup-patterns.md](./cleanup-patterns.md)** for detailed transformation examples covering all 10 patterns: simple if/else, no-else blocks, collection-if, entire file/class, nested conditions, early returns, ternary expressions, variable assignments, Kotlin when expressions, and SwiftUI conditional views. Also includes boolean simplification rules and edge cases.

**Key principles:**
- Apply boolean simplification when flag is part of a compound expression
- Trace indirect usages (flag stored in variable → find all variable usages)
- If unsure about a transformation → skip it, leave a TODO comment
- Only resolve the TARGET flag — leave other flags/conditions untouched

### Phase 3: Cascade Cleanup

> Strategy: Leverage static analysis tools (not manual reasoning) to find cascade issues. Iterate until the analyzer reports no new warnings.

**Approach: Analyzer-Driven Iterative Cleanup**

```
loop:
  1. Run static analysis (`dart analyze`, Kotlin compiler, Swift build)
  2. Parse warnings/errors related to files already modified:
     - Unused imports
     - Unused variables/fields
     - Unused parameters
     - Unreachable code
     - Empty bodies/blocks
  3. If new warnings found → fix them
  4. If warnings create MORE orphaned code → repeat from step 1
  5. If no new warnings → exit loop (clean state achieved)
```

**What to fix in each iteration:**
1. **Dead imports**: Remove `import` lines that are no longer referenced
2. **Unused variables/fields**: Remove declarations that lost their only consumer
3. **Empty blocks**: Remove empty methods, empty classes, empty if-bodies
4. **Orphaned files** (drop action): If removing a class leaves a file with nothing in it → delete file
5. **Unused parameters**: Remove from private methods. For public APIs → flag in PR as "⚠️ breaking change — needs manual review"

**Stopping conditions:**
- Analyzer reports zero new warnings on touched files → done
- Only remaining warnings are pre-existing (existed before cleanup) → done
- Iteration count exceeds 10 → stop, report remaining issues in PR description

**Critical: Ignore pre-existing warnings.** Before starting cleanup, capture the baseline analyzer output. Only act on NEW warnings that appeared after the flag removal. Never fix unrelated pre-existing issues — that's scope creep and pollutes the PR diff.

**Important:** Only fix warnings in files the AI has already touched or that are DIRECTLY related to the flag removal. Do not go on a codebase-wide cleanup spree.

### Phase 4: Config & Registry Cleanup

1. **Remove flag constant definition** from the constants file
2. **Remove flag registration** from any initialization/registry code
3. **Remove Firebase Remote Config** entries if managed in code (JSON files, default configs)
4. **Remove feature toggle UI** entries if the flag appears in any admin/debug panel

### Phase 5: Test Cleanup

> AI must reason about what each test is ACTUALLY testing, not just whether it references the flag.

**Decision framework for each test that references the flag:**

1. **Is the flag the SOLE subject of the test?**
   - e.g., "should show legacy UI when flag is OFF"
   - `graduate` → DELETE the "flag OFF" test case, KEEP the "flag ON" test (unwrap it — it's now the default)
   - `drop` → DELETE the "flag ON" test case, KEEP the "flag OFF" test (unwrap it — it's now the default)

2. **Is the flag just part of the test setup (testing something else)?**
   - e.g., test sets flag ON in `setUp()` then tests travel booking flow
   - `graduate` → Remove the flag mock from setup, keep the test intact (it's testing travel booking, not the flag)
   - `drop` → DELETE the entire test (the feature no longer exists, so the test has no subject)

3. **Is it a group/describe wrapper based on flag state?**
   - e.g., `group('when travel flag is enabled', () { ... })`
   - `graduate` → Unwrap the group: keep all inner tests, remove the group wrapper
   - `drop` → DELETE the entire group (all those tests tested the removed feature)

4. **Is the flag mocked alongside other setup?**
   - e.g., `setUp() { mockFlag(ON); mockUser(admin); mockNetwork(online); }`
   - → Just remove the `mockFlag(ON)` line, leave everything else

**General rules:**
- Remove `import` of the flag constant from test files when no longer referenced
- If removing tests leaves an empty test file → delete the file
- If a test file has both flag-related and non-flag-related tests → keep the file, remove only flag tests

### Phase 6: Documentation Cleanup

1. **Remove flag references** from README, CHANGELOG, or inline comments
2. **Update feature documentation** if it mentions "behind flag X"
3. **Remove TODO/FIXME comments** related to the flag cleanup

### Phase 7: Verification & Summary

1. **Capture baseline** — Before running tests, establish a baseline:
   - Run tests BEFORE cleanup (stash changes) to identify pre-existing failures
   - Record which tests were already failing
2. **Run static analysis** — ensure no compile errors introduced
3. **Run existing tests** — compare results against baseline:
   - If test failures are ONLY pre-existing (same tests that failed before cleanup) → cleanup is clean
   - If NEW test failures appear (tests that passed before but fail now) → investigate and fix
   - Report both pre-existing and new failures clearly to the user
4. **Generate a summary** report to the user:
   - List all files modified/deleted
   - Describe each transformation applied
   - Note any ambiguous cases marked for manual review
   - Report test results distinguishing pre-existing vs new failures

> **Scope boundary:** This skill handles CODE TRANSFORMATION only. Branch creation, commits, and PR opening are the user's responsibility. The skill's job ends when all files are correctly transformed and no NEW test failures are introduced.

---

## Safety Guardrails

1. **No confirmation checkpoint** — discovery is reliable (constants file pattern), proceed autonomously
2. **If unsure about a transformation** — do NOT transform. Leave the code as-is and add a `// TODO(flag-cleanup): manual review needed - {reason}` comment above the uncertain code block
3. **One flag per cleanup** — don't batch multiple flags in one run
4. **If tests fail after transformation** — distinguish pre-existing vs new failures. Run tests on stashed (original) code to establish baseline. Only investigate NEW failures introduced by the cleanup. Report clearly to user.
5. **If flag not found** — stop immediately and report to user
6. **Scope boundary** — only transform code, never create branches/commits/PRs

## Error Handling

| Scenario | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| Flag name not found anywhere | Stop immediately. Report "flag not found" to user. |
| Ambiguous transformation (unsure which branch) | Skip that usage. Add TODO comment. Continue with other usages. |
| Build fails after transformation | Report build errors to user. Do not undo. User decides. |
| Tests fail after transformation | Stash changes, run tests on original code to establish baseline. If failures are pre-existing (same tests failed before cleanup), report as "pre-existing — not caused by cleanup". If NEW failures appear, investigate and report. Do not undo. |
| Cascade loop exceeds 10 iterations | Stop cascade. Report remaining warnings. Proceed to next phase. |
| Analyzer unavailable (tool not installed) | Warn user that cascade cleanup is best-effort without analyzer. Proceed with manual reasoning. |
| File permission / read-only issue | Skip that file. Report to user. Continue with other files. |

## Language-Specific Notes

### Dart/Flutter
- Flag checks may use `?.` null-safe access
- Widget conditionals may use `if` inside collection literals: `[if (flag) Widget()]`
- Look for `Visibility`, `Offstage`, or conditional `child:` patterns

### Kotlin (Android)
- May use `when` expressions instead of `if/else`
- Look for `@Composable` conditional rendering
- Feature flags may be injected via DI (Dagger/Hilt)

### Swift (iOS)
- May use `guard` statements
- Look for `#if` compile-time flags (different from runtime flags!)
- SwiftUI conditional views with `if` in `body`

## Example Invocations

**Graduate a flag:**
> "Clean up feature flag `flag_mod_xpm_travel` — it's graduated. Keep the enabled code. Repo at `/path/to/your-app`"

**Drop a flag:**
> "Drop feature flag `flag_dev_experiment_42` — the experiment failed. Remove the feature code. Repo at `/path/to/your-app`"

---

## Errors & Edge Cases

| Scenario | Handling |
|----------|----------|
| Flag not found in codebase | Report to user, ask if name is correct |
| Flag used in 50+ places | Warn user about large change, proceed with confirmation |
| Flag combined with other flags | Only remove target flag from boolean expression |
| No else branch exists | Graduate: remove entire if block (keep body). Drop: remove entire if block. |
| Flag check in dead code | Remove regardless (it's dead code being cleaned anyway) |
| Test-only flag | Ask user: is this a test fixture flag or a real flag being tested? |
