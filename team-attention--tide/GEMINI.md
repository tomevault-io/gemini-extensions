# Tide — Project Rules

## Evidence-First (BLOCKING)

**Every factual claim in a response MUST be backed by evidence you gathered in this conversation.**
Evidence means: code you read, search results you got, docs you checked, or something the user told you.
If you have no evidence, you MUST gather it before responding — or explicitly ask the user.

**This is a blocking rule.** Do NOT write a response containing factual claims, then plan to verify afterward. Verify FIRST, respond SECOND.

How to apply:
1. **Before describing how something works** — read the relevant code first
2. **Before claiming something exists or doesn't exist** — search for it first
3. **Before proposing an approach** — understand the current system by reading code first
4. **If no evidence can be found** — say "I don't know" and ask the user

Violations include:
- Describing architecture, threading model, data flow, or patterns without reading the code
- Claiming a feature exists or doesn't exist without searching
- Proposing technical tradeoffs based on assumptions about the codebase
- Saying "currently X works like Y" without having read X

This applies to everything: how code works, what a function does, whether something is used, side effects of a change, external library APIs and their behavior, etc.

## Domain Language (Required)

All code, commits, PRs, and discussions MUST use the terms defined in `docs/glossary.md`.
Before writing code or describing changes, check the glossary. If a term doesn't exist, add it.

Key terms to always use precisely:
- **Pane** (not "panel", "tab", "window") — a content container with a PaneId
- **PaneKind** — the 5 types: Terminal, Editor, Diff, Browser, Launcher
- **Workspace** — an isolated set of panes + layout + focus (not "tab group", "session")
- **TabGroup** — multiple panes stacked in one layout slot (not "workspace")
- **FocusArea** — FileTree or PaneArea (not "focus mode", "focus zone")
- **SplitLayout** — the binary tree of splits (not "grid", "tiling")
- **ModalStack** — mutually-exclusive popups (not "dialog", "overlay")
- **GlobalAction** — a user-intent command from keybinding (not "event", "message")
- **Generation** — monotonic counter for cache invalidation (not "version", "revision")

## Bounded Contexts (Modules)

All code lives in tide-app (monocrate). Each module is a bounded context:

| Module | Path | Responsibility | Key Entities |
|--------|------|---------------|--------------|
| core_types | `domain/core_types.rs` | Shared types & traits | PaneId, Rect, Key, TerminalGrid |
| layout | `domain/layout/` | Binary split tree | SplitLayout, TabGroup |
| terminal | `domain/terminal/` | PTY & grid sync | Terminal |
| editor | `domain/editor/` | Text buffer & cursor | EditorState |
| input | `domain/input/` | Keybinding resolution | Router, Hotkey, GlobalAction |
| tree | `domain/tree/` | Filesystem & git status | FsTree |
| pane | `domain/pane/` | Per-PaneKind state | TerminalPane, EditorPane, BrowserPane, DiffPane |
| modal | `domain/modal/` | ModalStack popups | FileFinderState, GitSwitcherState, ContextMenuState |
| state | `domain/state/` | Grouped App state | WorkspaceManager, GatewayStatus, BackgroundServices |
| services | `application/services/` | Use-case orchestration on App | action, pane_create, file_tree, session, workspace |
| gateway (cli) | `adapter/inward/cli_adapter/` | Agent Gateway: MCP/CLI dispatch over the Unix socket | GatewayServer, CliPorts |
| platform | `adapter/outward/platform_adapter/` (macos/) | Native macOS windowing | PlatformEvent, PlatformWindow |
| renderer | `adapter/outward/renderer_adapter/` | GPU rendering pipeline | WgpuRenderer, GlyphAtlas |
| lsp | `adapter/outward/lsp_adapter/` | Language server protocol | LspClient, LspManager |

Aliases in `main.rs`: `pub(crate) use domain::terminal as tide_terminal;` etc. — `crate::tide_X::` paths work everywhere.

## Feature Development (MUST)

When adding a new feature or fixing a bug, follow this order. **Do not skip steps or reverse the order.**

```
1. Spec   → Understand the system → Clarify requirements with user → Write spec
2. Test   → Write behavior tests for each Business Rule (crates/tide-app/src/application/behavior_tests/)
3. Code   → Write code that passes the tests
```

- Never skip or reverse this order — even when told "just do it all" or "don't ask questions". Those instructions mean "work autonomously", NOT "skip the process".
- No code without a spec, no implementation without tests
- Same applies when modifying existing specs: spec change → test change → code change
- When a new requirement is discovered mid-implementation, STOP coding and loop back: update spec → add test → then code
- Use domain terms from `docs/glossary.md` when writing specs. Add new terms to glossary first if needed.

### Spec Format (`docs/specs/{feature}.md`)

```markdown
# Spec: {Name}

## Overview
### As-Is             ← Current state and problems (concrete, code-based)
### To-Be             ← Target state after changes
### Approach          ← Step-by-step plan to get there
## Bounded Contexts    ← Related crates
## Use Cases           ← Actor, Trigger, Precondition, Flow, Postcondition, Business Rules
## Invariants          ← Invariants that must hold
## Tests               ← UC ↔ BR ↔ test function mapping table
## Location            ← Code location
```

### Test Conventions

- Test module comment: `// Spec: docs/specs/{feature}.md`
- UC section comment: `// --- UC-N: {Name} ---`
- Each test references its BR: `// UC-N BR-M: {rule description}`
- Test name = natural language sentence: `fn closing_last_pane_in_workspace_shows_launcher()`

### Naming Rule

- Glossary Term = code type name (must match)
- Spec Use Case name = test section comment (must match)
- Business Rule number = referenced in test function comment

See `docs/testing/behavior-tests.md` for the full guide.

## Commit Messages

Format: `<verb> <what> in <module>`

```
Add pane drag preview in tide-app
Fix TabGroup active index after layout
Extract GridSyncer dirty tracking in terminal
```

- Verb: Add (new feature), Fix (bug), Extract (refactor), Remove, Update
- What: Use domain terms from glossary
- Module: Which bounded context module is primarily affected

## PR Description

Follow the template in `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`. Must include:
- Which Spec(s) and Use Case(s) are affected (e.g. `pane-lifecycle UC-5: ClosePane`)
- Which Bounded Context(s) are touched
- Which Entities/Aggregates are modified
- Which Invariants are preserved or changed
- Which behavior tests were added (with BR references)

## Architecture Invariants

These must NEVER be violated:

1. **PaneId sync**: Every PaneId in SplitLayout MUST exist in App.panes HashMap, and vice versa
2. **Single active workspace**: Only the active Workspace is loaded into App fields; others are cold-stored in WorkspaceManager
3. **Modal exclusivity**: At most one modal in ModalStack can be open at a time
4. **Input routing priority**: Modal → FocusArea → Router → TextInput (never skip a level)
5. **Generation monotonicity**: chrome_generation and pane_generations only increase, never decrease or reset **within a workspace session**. Exception: pane_generations is cleared on workspace switch (entirely new pane set)
6. **IME proxy lifecycle**: Every pane with keyboard focus must have an active IME proxy; proxy must be synced on every event
7. **Hexagonal dependency direction**: Inward adapters (`adapter/inward/`) MUST NOT directly mutate domain state. They call Inward Port trait methods only. Enforced by `scripts/lint-arch.sh`.

## Hexagonal Layer Rules (MUST)

The codebase follows hexagonal (ports & adapters) architecture. **Dependency direction is strictly enforced.**

```
adapter/inward/  →  application/ports/inward/  →  application/services/  →  domain/
                                                         ↓
                                                   application/ports/outward/  →  adapter/outward/
```

### What each layer CAN access:

| Layer | CAN use | CANNOT use |
|-------|---------|------------|
| `adapter/inward/*` | Inward Port traits (`ActionPort`, `PaneLifecyclePort`, `DockPort`, etc.), domain types for **reading** (`PaneKind`, `FocusArea` for pattern matching) | Direct mutation of `self.layout`, `self.panes`, `self.focus`, `self.router`, `self.ime`, `self.cache`, `self.assoc` |
| `application/services/*` | Domain types, Outward Port traits, all App fields | External I/O directly (must go through outward ports) |
| `domain/*` | Only other domain types | Anything in `adapter/` or `application/` |
| `adapter/outward/*` | Outward Port traits (implements them), external libraries | Inward ports, other outward adapters |

### How inward adapters should work:

```rust
// ✅ CORRECT: Call a port method
fn cli_open_browser(&mut self, params: Value) -> Result<Value, CliError> {
    let url = params.get("url").and_then(|v| v.as_str()).map(String::from);
    self.open_browser_pane(url);  // PaneLifecyclePort method
    Ok(json!({"pane_id": self.focus.focused}))
}

// ❌ WRONG: Directly manipulate domain state
fn cli_render_html(&mut self, params: Value) -> Result<Value, CliError> {
    let new_id = self.layout.split(source, SplitDirection::Horizontal);  // VIOLATION
    self.panes.insert(new_id, PaneKind::Browser(pane));                   // VIOLATION
    self.focus.focused = Some(new_id);                                     // VIOLATION
}
```

### When a port method doesn't exist:

If the inward adapter needs behavior that no existing port provides, **add a new method to the appropriate port trait first**, then implement it in the corresponding service. Never bypass the port layer.

### Exceptions:

- **Reading** domain state for response building (e.g., `self.focus.focused == Some(id)`, iterating `self.panes`) is allowed — only **mutation** is prohibited.
- `adapter/outward/view/` reads domain state to produce render output — this is the View in State/Update/View and is allowed.
- `compute_layout()` may be called after port methods if layout recomputation is needed.

## File Structure

- `docs/glossary.md` — Single source of truth for all domain terms
- `docs/context-map.md` — How bounded contexts relate
- `docs/domain/*.md` — Per-context deep dives
- `docs/specs/*.md` — Use Case specs with Business Rules (testable)
- `docs/testing/behavior-tests.md` — How to write behavior tests
- `crates/tide-app/src/application/behavior_tests/` — Living specification (test count: see CI)

## Tooling-Dictated Paths

These paths are fixed by Cargo/build tooling and **cannot be moved** into the module tree:

| Path | Reason |
|------|--------|
| `crates/alacritty_terminal/` | External library fork. `[patch.crates-io]` requires an independent crate with its own `Cargo.toml`. |
| `crates/tide-app/benches/` | Cargo standard. `cargo bench` only discovers benchmarks in this path. |
| `crates/tide-app/build.rs` | Cargo standard. Build scripts must be at the crate root. |
| `domain/editor/syntaxes/` | `include_str!` requires files relative to the source file. Data files live near the module that includes them. |
