## What loft is

**loft** is a tree-walking interpreter for the **loft** programming language, written in Rust.
Loft is a statically typed, expression-oriented language with struct/enum support, a
store-based heap, and a standard library loaded from `default/*.loft`.

---

## Key commands

```bash
cargo run --bin loft -- myprogram.loft        # run a loft program
cargo run --bin loft -- --help                # CLI help
cargo run --bin gendoc                        # regenerate doc/*.html
make ci                                       # fmt → clippy → test (full local gate)
make test                                     # clippy + test; output in result.txt
```

## Key data structures

| Type | File | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `Value` (enum) | `src/data.rs` | IR tree node |
| `Type` (enum) | `src/data.rs` | Static type of a `Value` |
| `Data` | `src/data.rs` | Table of all named definitions |
| `State` | `src/state/mod.rs` | Bytecode stream + runtime stack |
| `Stores` | `src/database/mod.rs` | All stores + type schema |
| `Store` | `src/store.rs` | Raw word-addressed heap |
| `DbRef` | `src/keys.rs` | Universal pointer: (store_nr, rec, pos) |

---

## Important conventions

- User functions are stored as `"n_<name>"` — use `data.def_nr("n_foo")`, not `data.def_nr("foo")`.
- Native stdlib: global functions use `n_<func>`; methods use `t_<LEN><Type>_<method>` (LEN = chars in type name). Example: `t_4text_starts_with`, `t_9character_is_numeric`.
- Operators: `OpCamelCase` in loft source → `op_snake_case` in Rust (`fill.rs`).
- `#rust "..."` annotations in `default/*.loft` supply the Rust body for code generation.
- Full naming and null-sentinel rules: see [CODE.md](doc/claude/CODE.md).

---

## Default standard library load order

```
default/01_code.loft    — operators, math, text, collections
default/02_images.loft  — Image, Pixel, File, Format types
default/03_text.loft    — text utilities
```

---

## Loft language patterns

For writing or reviewing `.loft` files see the **loft-write skill**
(`.claude/skills/loft-write/SKILL.md`) — naming conventions, type reference, format
strings, loop attributes, lambdas, known bugs and workarounds, pre-flight checklist.

Full language reference: [LOFT.md](doc/claude/LOFT.md) and [STDLIB.md](doc/claude/STDLIB.md).

## Branch policy — MANDATORY

**Direct commits to `main` are not allowed.**

All changes — features, bug fixes, refactors, documentation updates — must land on a
feature branch and reach `main` only through a pull request.

### Why

`main` is the release branch. Every commit on `main` is expected to be releasable.
Direct commits bypass code review, CI, and the structured commit sequence documented in
[DEVELOPMENT.md](doc/claude/DEVELOPMENT.md). Feature branches keep `main` clean and
give each item a traceable history.

### Rules

1. **Never `git commit` directly on `main`.** If you accidentally land on `main`, move
   the change to a feature branch before anything else.
2. **Never `git push` without an explicit user instruction** — see the Remote CI section
   of [DEVELOPMENT.md](doc/claude/DEVELOPMENT.md).
3. **Never create a branch, push, or open a PR unless the user explicitly asks.**
   Each pull request costs the user real review time — more than the code took to
   write.  Default mode is: work on the current branch, commit locally, report what
   changed, and wait.  Only run `gh pr create`, `git push`, or `git checkout -b`
   after the user explicitly says "push", "create PR", "open a PR", "merge", or
   "switch to a new branch".
   - "fix X" or "implement Y" is *not* a PR instruction.  Commit locally and stop.
   - "commit and push" is a push instruction, not a PR instruction.
   - A previous prompt that said "open a PR" does not authorise the next PR.
     Ask each time, or infer from the exact current prompt.
   - When in doubt, summarise what is ready and ask whether to push.
4. Create branches from the tip of `main` using the naming convention in
   [DEVELOPMENT.md](doc/claude/DEVELOPMENT.md) (e.g. `p1-1-lambda-parser`, `benchmark`).
5. Merging back to `main` is done via a GitHub pull request — not a local `git merge`.

---

## Debugging policy — MANDATORY

### Never use `git bisect` or `git checkout HEAD -- <files>` to investigate bugs

**`git bisect` is prohibited.**  Running bisect requires compiling and testing dozens of
commits autonomously.  Claude cannot do this reliably: context windows are finite,
intermediate states are inconsistent, and the process routinely requires reverting
working-in-progress files — destroying multi-session work that is not yet committed.

**`git checkout HEAD -- <file>` to "reset and try again" is prohibited.**  This silently
discards uncommitted changes on specific files.  When multiple files are in flight across
a feature branch, resetting individual files breaks invariants between them and produces
states that are harder to debug than the original problem.

**Use these approaches instead:**

- Read the failing test's dump file (`tests/dumps/*.txt`) — it contains the full IR,
  bytecode, and execution trace.  The root cause is almost always visible there.
- Add `LOFT_LOG=minimal` or `LOFT_LOG=crash_tail:50` to the failing test to narrow down
  the execution step.
- Read the relevant source files and reason about the code path.  A focused read of
  3–5 files is faster and safer than any automated bisect.
- If a regression appeared after a specific recent commit, use `git show <commit>` or
  `git diff <commit>^ <commit>` to read that change — do not re-run old code.

---

## Git safety — MANDATORY

### Never use `git stash pop` or `git pull` with uncommitted changes

**`git stash` + `git stash pop` is prohibited.**  Stash pop applies changes as a
merge, which routinely produces conflicts across dozens of files.  A failed pop
leaves the working directory in an unrecoverable state — all uncommitted work is
destroyed.  This has caused complete loss of multi-hour sessions.

**`git pull` with uncommitted changes is prohibited.**  Pull fetches and merges,
which also conflicts with in-flight work.

**Use these approaches instead:**

- **To compare with main:** use `git diff main -- <file>` or
  `git show origin/main:<file>` — no branch switch needed.
- **To check if a bug is pre-existing:** commit current work first (even as WIP
  on the feature branch), then compare.
- **To update from remote:** commit first, then `git pull`, resolve if needed.
- **To test on clean main:** commit, `git checkout main`, test, `git checkout -`
  to return.

The rule: **always commit before any operation that changes the working tree.**

## Debug logging — `LOFT_LOG` quick reference

Set before `cargo test` to control what appears in `tests/dumps/*.txt`:

| Value | What you get |
|---|---|
| *(unset)* or `full` | IR + bytecode + execution, slot annotations (default) |
| `static` | IR + bytecode only — fastest for codegen debugging |
| `minimal` | Execution trace for `test` only — cleanest for runtime bugs |
| `ref_debug` | Full + stack snapshots after every Ref/CreateStack op |
| `bridging` | Execution + bridging-invariant warnings |
| `crash_tail:N` | Last N execution lines; flushed on panic |
| `fn:<name>` | Only the named function |
| `variables` | Variable table (name, type, scope, slot, live interval) per function |
| `all_fns` | Bytecode of all functions including `default/` built-ins |

Full API: [TESTING.md](doc/claude/TESTING.md) § LogConfig and `src/log_config.rs`.

Every opcode that produces or consumes a `DbRef` shows an inline struct/vector dump
in the trace: `#3.1 { name: "x", inner: #2.1 { val: 42 } }`.  Tune with:

| Env var | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `LOFT_DUMP_DEPTH` | `2` | Max nesting depth before `{...}` / `[N items...]` |
| `LOFT_DUMP_ELEMENTS` | `8` | Max vector elements before `...N more` |

Also works with `cargo run --bin loft` when `LOFT_LOG` is set (writes to stderr).
See [DEBUG.md](doc/claude/DEBUG.md) § Database / Struct Debug Dumps for details.
