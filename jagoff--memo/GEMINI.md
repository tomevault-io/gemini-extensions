# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

memo is a local-first semantic memory: MLX embeddings + sqlite-vec hybrid
(vec + BM25) search, reranking, a knowledge graph, temporal reasoning, an MCP
server, and a CLI. Single-user, runs offline. PyPI distribution name is `mlx-memo`; CLI binary is `memo`; MCP server binary is `memo-mcp`.

## Dev commands

```bash
# Tests (no MLX needed — MLX tests skip automatically on non-Apple Silicon)
uv run --no-sync pytest tests/                          # full suite
uv run --no-sync pytest tests/test_foo.py::test_bar -v  # single test

# Type checking
uv run --no-sync mypy src/memo/

# Lint + format
uv run --no-sync ruff check src/ && uv run --no-sync ruff format src/

# Run the CLI
uv run --no-sync memo <cmd>

# Validate MEMO_* flags (typos, unknown vars)
uv run --no-sync memo config validate
```

## Working tree is shared (read before any git op)

This repo is frequently worked on by **concurrent agent sessions sharing one
working tree and HEAD**. Their commits land on whatever branch is checked out,
master advances underneath you, and a `git checkout` in another session moves
*your* HEAD too. So:

- **Never `git add -A` / `git commit -a` / `ruff format src/`** — they sweep in
  other sessions' in-flight files. Stage explicit paths only:
  `git add src/memo/foo.py tests/test_foo.py`. Lint/format only your files.
- **Check `git reflog` + `git status` before any `reset`/`checkout`** — you may
  un-reference a concurrent commit or move a shared HEAD.
- **Cut releases from an isolated worktree**, never `git checkout master` in the
  shared tree: `git worktree add --detach /tmp/rel origin/master`, cherry-pick
  your commit, bump versions + CHANGELOG, commit, `git push origin HEAD:master`,
  tag, `git worktree remove --force`. Check `git ls-remote --tags origin vX.Y.Z`
  first — a concurrent session may have taken your version number.
- Nothing is lost on entanglement (commits live in `git reflog`, uncommitted
  work stays in the tree). Rebuild a clean branch with
  `git checkout <branch> -- <only your files>` (zsh does NOT word-split `$VAR` —
  list paths explicitly).

## Architecture

**`Memory` facade** (`src/memo/memory/facade.py`) multiply-inherits thirteen operation mixins — `_WriteOpsMixin`, `_UpdateOpsMixin`, `_DeleteOpsMixin`, `_SearchOpsMixin`, `_SearchScoringMixin`, `_AskOpsMixin`, `_ChatAskOpsMixin`, `_RerankOpsMixin`, `_RepoOpsMixin`, `_MaintainOpsMixin`, `_ConsolidateOpsMixin`, `_ReplayOpsMixin`, `_SecretOpsMixin` — each in their own `src/memo/memory/<op>_ops.py` file. Module-level constants, prompts, and pure helpers are in `src/memo/memory/record.py`. Never import from a mixin directly; always go through `Memory`.

**MCP server** (`src/memo/server.py`) registers tools via `build_server()`. Each domain is a `server_<domain>.py` module that exports `register(server, memory)` — called once in `build_server()`. Adding a new MCP tool = create `src/memo/server_<domain>.py` + add one `register` call in `server.py`. The `_MaintainOpsMixin` method is directly callable from tests via `mock_memory.<method>()`.

**Storage** (`src/memo/store/`) is a subpackage. `VecStore` in `queries.py` is the primary interface: one sqlite-vec DB file, thread-local connections (required for FastMCP HTTP worker threadpool). Writes use `_tx()` (`BEGIN IMMEDIATE`); vectors are packed float32 blobs; WAL mode + `busy_timeout`.

**CLI** is in `src/memo/cli.py` (entry-point wiring only) + `src/memo/cli_<domain>.py` files. Each domain file exports a Click command or group imported and registered in `cli.py`.

**Flags** (`src/memo/flags.py`) is the single registry for all `MEMO_*` env vars — it aggregates `FlagSpec`s defined in the per-domain `flags_<group>.py` modules (`flags_recall/search/behavior/capture/ingest/misc.py`, base types in `flags_base.py`). Add a new flag in the matching `flags_<group>.py`. Use `flag_bool/int/float/str(name)` — never `os.environ.get("MEMO_...")` inline. `memo config validate` parses every set flag.

**Cache** (`src/memo/cache.py`): query embeddings use Memo's native
thread-safe LRU cache when `MEMO_QUERY_CACHE_SIZE > 0`. The stable path never
loads a cache implementation from another package.

**Contracts and replay URIs** (`src/memo/contracts.py`,
`src/memo/memory/replay_ops.py`): Memo owns its request/result contracts and
`memo://` parser. Legacy field names are migration aliases only.

**Sync — two explicit tiers** (`src/memo/sync_git.py`, `src/memo/identity.py`):
- **LOCAL (intra-machine):** all sessions on a Mac share one `data_dir`/`memvec.db`
  (WAL, thread-local conns), so a save/capture is visible to sibling sessions on
  their next recall **with no git**. `sync_tier(cfg)` → `"local"` when no git
  remote is configured.
- **REMOTE (inter-machine):** the git `memo-sync` remote is the only cross-machine
  channel. `sync_tier(cfg)` → `"remote"`. ONE owner per machine: `sync_once()`
  takes an `flock` on `state_dir/.sync.lock` (concurrent same-machine sessions
  skip — their writes ride the lock holder's push) and does
  **pull-rebase-before-push** so an advanced remote rebases instead of rejecting.
  Triggers: per-prompt `memo sync auto` (debounced via `MEMO_SYNC_PUSH_DEBOUNCE_S`
  / `MEMO_SYNC_PULL_INTERVAL_S`, async hook) + `memo sync once` on Stop. A failed
  push stamps `state_dir/sync_pending` and retries next trigger. The repo also
  carries per-machine **embed-cache shards** (`embed_cache/<device_id>.json`,
  `sync_embed_cache.py`, `MEMO_SYNC_EMBED_CACHE` default on): document/chunk
  embeddings of the durable corpus, imported into `repo_embedding_cache` before
  the post-pull reindex — so memories saved on another Mac (and `memo sync
  bootstrap` on a fresh one) index with ~zero local MLX embed calls. Derived
  data only; reference/vault tier never exports.
- **Identity** (`identity.py`): stable `machine_id` (= persisted `cfg.device_id`,
  also `history.device_id`) + `hostname` + `session_id` + `terminal`. Commits are
  attributed `[<hostname>·<session>]`; Memo owns and exposes the identity.
- **Durable capture:** `memo capture-tick` (per-prompt async, self-throttled by
  `MEMO_CAPTURE_INTERVAL_S`) captures NEW turns since a per-session watermark so a
  long session's insight reaches `.md` before Stop, not only at Stop.
- `memo sync status` / `memo doctor` surface the silent no-op (not a clone) and
  stranded commits. The legacy audit-log replay (`sync.py` `SyncManager`) is the
  `--remote <path>` fallback; the machine `flock` is the coordinator.

**Memory types** (`src/memo/tiers.py`): durable tier = `decision`, `fact`, `bug`, `feedback`, `preference`, `note`, `manual`, `synthesis`; reference tier = `reference` (bulk-ingested vault chunks, excluded from auto-recall). `synthesis` memories are auto-generated by `memo synthesize` / `MEMO_SYNTHESIS_ENABLED=1 memo maintain` — cross-cluster inferred insights with `synthesis_sources` provenance in their `extra` frontmatter bag.

## MLX invariants (do not violate)

The embedder/LLM path depends on four invariants. A diff touching
`src/memo/embedder.py`, `src/memo/llm.py`, `src/memo/memory/` (any file), or anything
that calls `.embed()` / `.chat()` must preserve all four:

1. **Asymmetric retrieval prefix on QUERIES only.** Query text gets
   `_QUERY_INSTRUCTION_PREFIX` (see `embedder.embed_query`); stored documents do
   **not**. Prefixing both (or neither) collapses cosine similarity — the model
   places prefixed and raw inputs in different regions of the space.
2. **`MLXEmbedder.embed()` takes `Sequence[str]`, never a bare `str`.** A bare
   string is iterated as characters and silently produces garbage. Always wrap:
   `embed([text])`.
3. **`MEMO_EMBEDDER_DIMS` must match the model.** 1024 / 2560 / 4096 for the
   0.6B / 4B / 8B Qwen3-Embedding models. Default model is
   `mlx-community/Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B-4bit-DWQ` (1024-dim). A mismatch corrupts
   the vec0 table or fails the dims-validation guard in `store/queries.py`.
4. **`mlx` / `mlx-lm` imports stay deferred** (inside functions, not at module
   level) — module-level import drags the MLX runtime into every CLI invocation
   and blows the recall-hook cold-start budget.

When stubbing `MLXEmbedder.embed` in tests, also pin `MEMO_EMBEDDER_DIMS` to the
stub's output dim.

## Recall hook (UserPromptSubmit) — 5s budget

`memo recall-hook` is wired into Claude Code's UserPromptSubmit hook
(`hooks/hooks.json`). End-to-end it must stay under ~5s. Cold MLX load is ~2s,
leaving ~3s for embed + vec search + format. The rerank candidate pool
auto-shrinks (and `MEMO_RECALL_TOKEN_BUDGET` caps output) so warm latency stays
under the timeout. Anything added to the hook path — `hooks/hooks.json`, the
`recall-hook` command in `src/memo/cli.py`, `embedder.py`, `store/queries.py` search —
must respect that budget. A warm `memo-mcp` HTTP/recall daemon serves embeds
over a socket (`MEMO_EMBEDDER_VIA_DAEMON`) to skip cold load.

## Runtime

`memo` and `memo-mcp` must resolve from the **same isolated runtime**
(pipx / `uv tool` / Homebrew) — **not** a project `.venv`. A mixed runtime is the
usual cause of "works in CLI, broken in MCP". `memo doctor --strict-runtime`
checks this.

Runtime plumbing lives in `src/memo/runtime/`: `install.py` (runtime/install
detection + `memo doctor`/install helpers), `daemon.py` (launchctl + warm
recall-daemon lifecycle, `MEMO_EMBEDDER_VIA_DAEMON` socket), `report.py`
(install-report presentation). These were extracted from `cli.py`/`cli_runtime`;
the warm `memo-mcp` daemon they manage is what serves embeds over the socket to
keep the recall hook under its 5s budget.

## BM25 / Spanish search

FTS5's tokenizer wraps each `\w+` token in its own phrase quotes, so a
multi-token query becomes an AND-of-tokens (not a phrase match). `store/bm25_queries.py`
tokenizes, AND-joins, and falls back to OR only on zero recall. Diacritics are
folded (`unicode61 remove_diacritics 2`) so "decision" matches "decisión".

## Storage

`VecStore` (`src/memo/store/queries.py`) is sqlite-vec backed, one DB file, **one
connection per thread** (thread-local — required for the FastMCP HTTP transport's
worker threadpool). Writes go through `_tx()` (`BEGIN IMMEDIATE`); vectors are
packed float32 blobs; WAL mode + `busy_timeout` give concurrent readers + a
writer.

### Markdown is the source of truth; sqlite is a rebuildable index

The `.md` files are canonical; the sqlite index is **derived and replayable**:

- **Authority.** `save()` writes the `.md` first, then indexes — if indexing
  fails, the memory is stamped `_memo_embed_pending` on disk and `memo reindex`
  replays it (the save never silently vanishes). `delete()` drops the derived
  index **first** and removes the canonical `.md` **last**, rolling the store
  back (`StorageError`) if the unlink fails — so the truth-bearing file is never
  lost to a partial delete (a leftover index row is recoverable via `reindex`).
  A hand-edit in Obsidian wins on the next `reindex` (body_hash mismatch → disk
  overwrites the index).
- **Rebuild, don't `rm`.** Use `memo reindex --rebuild` (not `rm memvec.db`) to
  rebuild from disk. It truncates only the markdown-derivable tables
  (`meta`/`vec`/`fts`) and preserves the **user-signal** tables — `access`,
  `memory_health`, `source_feedback*` — which are PRIMARY data not present in
  markdown and re-join on the stable memory `id`. A content-addressed embedding
  cache (`repo_embedding_cache`, keyed on `model+dims+sha256(text)`) makes a warm
  rebuild issue ~zero embedder calls.
- **Memories in the vault.** `MEMO_MEMORIES_IN_VAULT=1` (needs `MEMO_VAULT_PATH`)
  stores memories under `<vault>/<SYSTEM_DIR>/AI/memory` so the human-editable
  Obsidian vault is the source of truth. Ingest already excludes `AI/` and any
  `id:`-frontmatter file, so they're never double-ingested as reference tier.
  `memo migrate --into-vault` moves an existing install there (non-destructive,
  `--rollback` restores the prior config). `memo migrate` never drops `memvec.db`.
- **One DB file (opt-in).** `MEMO_SINGLE_DB=1` folds the sidecar stores
  (history/graph/contradictions/crossref/fact_edges) into `memvec.db` — each keeps its own
  connection to the one file (WAL allows it; no shared-transaction risk). Run
  `memo migrate --consolidate-db` once to merge existing `*.db` files (renames
  them `*.db.bak`, idempotent). Default off keeps the historical multi-file
  layout. The `cfg.*_db` path properties collapse onto `db_path` when on.
- **Per-project folders (default on).** `MEMO_STORE_BY_PROJECT=1` writes each new
  memory's `.md` into a per-project bucket — `memory_dir/<project>/` (or `_global/`
  when untagged) — derived from the `project:` tag (the tag stays the source of
  truth; the folder is derived). The sqlite index globs recursively, so search
  stays global — on-disk organization only. Recall then applies a 3-tier soft
  boost: `MEMO_RECALL_PROJECT_BOOST` (0.25, current project) > `MEMO_RECALL_GLOBAL_BOOST`
  (0.10, no project tag or `preference`/`feedback`) > other projects (+0).
  `memo migrate --bucket-by-project` re-buckets an existing flat install
  (non-destructive, idempotent, then reindexes). Backup/restore + git sync use
  `rglob`, so they preserve the bucket layout.

## Test isolation (see `tests/conftest.py`)

- Use the `tmp_cfg` fixture or build an isolated `Config` — never call
  `Config.from_env()` without controlling the environment.
- `CliRunner` invocations set `MEMO_NONINTERACTIVE=1`, `MEMO_DATA_DIR`, and
  `MEMO_STATE_DIR` in `env=` (conftest defaults `MEMO_NONINTERACTIVE=1`).
- Real MLX forward passes are gated by `@pytest.mark.requires_mlx` (auto-skipped
  when `mlx_lm` isn't importable).
- Never read or write the developer's real vault.

## Config & errors

- `MEMO_*` behavioral flags live in `src/memo/flags.py` (registry + typed accessors). Storage/model config lives in `src/memo/config.py` (typed `Config` dataclass). Prefer `flag_bool/int/float/str` over raw `os.environ`. `memo config validate` catches typos.
- **User-facing config is the persistent Markdown config** (`src/memo/config_md.py`): `memo config` / `memo config set <key> <value>` (dotted keys, e.g. `recall.top_k`) writes `~/.config/memo/*-config.md` — reaches daemons/MCP/hooks, unlike a per-terminal `export MEMO_*`. Flag resolution: **env var > markdown config > tuned overlay > built-in default**.
- Domain errors live in `src/memo/errors.py` (`MemoError` base). Raise/catch
  those rather than bare `Exception` in non-defensive code.

## Releasing

Bump the version in sync across **five** source-of-truth files:
`pyproject.toml` `[project].version`, `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`,
`plugins/memo/.codex-plugin/plugin.json`, `server.json` (version + package
version), and `CHANGELOG.md` (Keep-a-Changelog) — `memo release bump` edits
all five. Commit / tag / push stays manual.

## Source of truth — role & contract

memo is the canonical store of **durable semantic knowledge**: decisions,
facts, preferences, learnings. It is consulted automatically (recall hook every
prompt; El Briefing at SessionStart) and stays fresh on its own (`memo
maintain` supersedes contradictions, merges duplicates, archives stale —
reversibly). The injected recall block is labelled authoritative, so treat
surfaced memories as established facts: prefer them over assumptions, build on
them, and contradict one only explicitly.

Memo is the source of truth for both durable knowledge and the operational
continuity needed by agents. Durable facts, decisions, preferences, focus,
handoffs, attention, conflicts, and outcome feedback all live behind Memo-owned
CLI/MCP contracts.

Contract for any agent using memo:
1. **Read first** — consult memo recall before deciding; `memo_unified_briefing`
   is the entry point.
2. **Write back** — persist durable facts to memo via `memo_save` so the next
   session inherits them.
3. **Respect freshness** — memo's contradiction/freshness state is authoritative
   for durable knowledge; don't reintroduce a fact memo has superseded.
4. **Identify yourself** — every read path is attributable, so `memo usefulness`
   proves who actually reads memo (a layer that never appears is a silent gap):
   - **MCP tools** — pass `source="<layer>"` on `memo_search` / `memo_ask` /
     `memo_chat_ask` / `memo_unified_briefing`. If omitted, `log_consult`
     falls back to `MEMO_SOURCE` then to the MCP client's handshake
     `clientInfo.name` — so agent clients (devin/opencode/devin-desktop) attribute
     automatically without per-call args.
   - **CLI** — `memo search/ask/chat-ask/recall` take `--source` or read
     `MEMO_SOURCE`; a consult logs only when one is set (an interactive
     `memo search` stays out of the stats).
   - **Warm socket** — the recall daemon's `{"op":"search","client":"<layer>"}`
     gives sub-second structured recall (no cold CLI) and attributes the client.

memo deliberately keeps cognition OFF its MCP surface
(`test_brain_like_mcp_tools_are_not_registered`): no `suggest`/`agent`/
`cognitive` verbs. Proactivity lives in memo's own recall/briefing output (the
"Also in your memory" nudge), not as a brain tool — memo is the store, the
layer above is the cognition.

## CI gates

`pytest`, `mypy`, `ruff` (on `src/` **and** `tests/`), and coverage run per
commit. Keep the suite green.

The `runtime-independence` job proves the installed distribution does not
resolve retired sibling modules or private contract packages. The definitive
benchmark also gates journal integrity and native event throughput.

## Retrieval-regression discipline (every failed search → a system change, measured)

**Rule:** when a search returns wrong results, do NOT patch that one query. Make a
**systemic** change (ingest quality, ranking, a general gate) and prove it holds
across the whole regression set — never per-question.

- Growing committed corpus: `eval/regression_labels.json` (schema
  `memo.eval_recall.labels.v1`). Every incident adds a labeled prompt:
  `relevant=true` + `expect_ids` (the note that MUST surface, ≥8 hex prefix),
  and `noise_tags` / `noise_path_fragments` for records that must NOT crowd
  top-K (garbled OCR screenshots, archived/old notes).
- Gate (fast, no MLX — retrieval only, ~0.5s/prompt):
  `memo eval recall --labels eval/regression_labels.json --k 5 --force`.
  A retrieval/ingest change must keep **precision@K** high and **noise@K** low
  across ALL prompts (the label set grows with every incident — 37 prompts as of
  2026-07; the authoritative numbers are the per-machine saved baseline below,
  not any figure hard-coded here). Runs against the live index (machine-local,
  not GitHub CI).
- **Enforced gate (machine-local, opt-in):** seed once with
  `memo eval recall --labels eval/regression_labels.json --k 5 --update-baseline`,
  then `--gate` (instead of printing) exits non-zero if precision dropped or
  noise rose vs the saved baseline — wire it into a pre-commit hook. The
  baseline lives under `state_dir/eval/` (per-machine; it tracks *your* corpus).
- Split of concerns: retrieval-class regressions (right note buried, garbage
  crowding) gate here; end-to-end grounding, abstention, and integrity gate in
  `memo definitive check` plus the relevant Memo eval command.

## Dream — nightly self-maintenance + self-improvement

`memo dream run` is the nightly pipeline (LaunchAgent `com.memo.dream` at 03:00;
`memo dream if-due` for the >24h guard). It is **separate from `memo maintain`**.
Wiring is `src/memo/cli_dream.py` (Click) + `src/memo/cli_dream_passes.py`
(`_run_*` implementations); the receipt persists to `state_dir/dream/last.json`
(`memo dream status`). Every pass records its result there and **failures land in
`receipt["errors"]` — never silently swallowed**.

- **Maintenance passes (default-on):** orientation inventory → signal-gather
  (transcript mining → memories) → contradictions (supersede ≥0.9) → consolidate
  duplicates → archive stale → `synthesize_cross_cluster` → entities → ROI decay
  → prune-floor / LFU-evict → compress → prewarm.
- **Dream v2 — self-improvement passes (all OFF by default, opt-in per flag):**
  - **Tuner** (`dream_tune.py`, `MEMO_DREAM_TUNE_ENABLED`): mines
    ground-truth-by-use labels from `grounding.log` (reuses
    `eval_recall.harvest_labels`), line-searches `MEMO_RECALL_MIN_SIM` over the
    live index, and **auto-applies** the winner — gated by the curated
    `eval/regression_labels.json` (a change that helps mined labels but hurts the
    curated set is rejected) and **auto-reverted** when a later night regresses
    vs the saved baseline. CLI `memo dream tune`. Scope: it only moves `min_sim`
    — the one knob the eval harness (`run_config` / `Cfg.floor`) measures
    faithfully in vec mode; boosts/rerank-pool need a recall-faithful eval (a
    pure `rank_hits()` extracted from `recall_logic._recall_logic`) and are
    deliberately deferred.
  - **Consolidate** (`dream_consolidate.py`,
    `MEMO_DREAM_CONSOLIDATE_EPISODES_ENABLED`): groups recent episodes
    (`EpisodeStore.recent`) by project and abstracts recurring cross-session work
    into one durable `type=synthesis` memory (`synthesis_kind=cross_session`,
    session ids as provenance, dedup by provenance hash). Distinct from per-turn
    signal-gather and cross-memory synthesize; no destructive episodic decay.
  - **Anticipate** (`dream_anticipate.py`, `MEMO_DREAM_ANTICIPATE_ENABLED`):
    surfaces recurring unmet gaps (`outcome.detect_gaps`) + hot queries into the
    receipt/briefing and pre-warms their embeddings. Never fabricates.
  - **Flag graduation** (`dream_flags.py`, `MEMO_DREAM_FLAG_GRADUATION_ENABLED`):
    every default-off `*_ENABLED` flag declares a gate in `dream_flags.GATES`
    (`recall` A/B via the eval `flag_overrides` seam / `tuner`-owned / `manual`
    + reason) — completeness CI-enforced by `test_dream_flags.py`, so a new
    dark flag cannot merge without declaring its gate. Winners graduate to ON
    via the overlay after `MEMO_FLAG_GRADUATION_WIN_NIGHTS` consecutive wins
    (latency + curated gates), auto-revert on regression; flags un-graduated
    past `MEMO_FLAG_GRADUATION_DEADLINE_DAYS` become cull candidates in
    `memo dream graduate-flags --status` (deletion stays human). Distinct from
    `dream_graduate.py` (quarantined-memory graduation).

**Tuned-params overlay** (`src/memo/tuned_overlay.py`) is the only place
auto-tuning touches live behavior: the tuner writes `state_dir/tuned_params.json`
and `flags.flag()` consults it, so flag resolution is **env var > markdown
config > overlay > built-in default** (an explicit `MEMO_*` env var or
`memo config set` value is never overridden). Delete the
file or `memo dream tune --rollback` to revert. The enable flags live in the
nightly LaunchAgent's `EnvironmentVariables` (launchd does not inherit the shell)
— see `~/repos/memo/launchd/com.memo.dream.plist`.

## Workflows (Claude Code dynamic workflows)

Saved orchestration scripts in `.claude/workflows/`, invoked as `/`-commands:

- `/demonolith-split [path]` — map a god-file and propose a clean in-repo package split (plan only). No arg → largest source file (e.g. `cli_capture.py`).

Use `/effort ultracode` when a change benefits from parallel in-repo
implementation and review.
