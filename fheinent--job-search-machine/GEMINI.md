## Core Philosophy

**Systems compound more than tactics do.** A single JD response matters less than the system that generates 20 of them. A single connection matters less than the mechanism that builds the network. The OS is that mechanism.

- **Precision over volume.** Every application is tailored. Every conversation is targeted. No spray-and-pray.
- **Real experience only.** Never fabricate skills, metrics, or projects. If the experience library doesn't hold it, flag the gap honestly.
- **Referrals are structural advantage.** Direct outreach without a warm introduction is noise. The system finds and activates referrals first, cold applications second.
- **The system surfaces patterns.** Each interview reveals weaknesses. Each company rejection illuminates a strategic gap. Each networking interaction uncovers market position. The system aggregates these signals.
- **20-30 minutes per day compounds.** The OS handles the mechanical heavy lifting (resume tailoring, interview research, company analysis). The user focuses on judgment, conversations, and work products.

---

## Context & Scope

This OS is built for **product managers and product-adjacent roles** (IC to Director level). It assumes:
- You have real product experience (or can demonstrate adjacent decision-making)
- You have a defined target market and 50-100 companies in scope
- You'll invest 30 min/day consistently for 2-3 months (job search window)
- You prefer strategic advantage over volume

**Inspiration & Credits:** This system is inspired by the Job Search OS built by Aakash Gupta (product-growth.com) and adapted for European markets and product-leadership focused searches. The company intel and behavioral frameworks reference Aakash's insider research.

## Required Inputs

Before running any skill, populate these context files:

| File | Purpose | Skippable? |
|------|---------|-----------|
| `context-library/experience-library.md` | Your full work history, STAR stories, and metrics. Single source of truth. | NO — every skill draws from this |
| `context-library/career-plan.md` | Your target level, function, company type, deal-breaker preferences | NO — shapes all outputs |
| `context-library/target-companies.md` | 50-100 ranked target companies with research | NO — directs outreach priority |
| `context-library/connection-tracker.md` | Contacts by company, relationship status | Optional for v1 |
| `context-library/interview-history.md` | Past interviews logged with scores and patterns | Optional — built over time |

**Cold start:** If context files are empty, tell the user to START HERE and guide them through filling the experience library first. Do not produce generic output from a blank library.

## Daily Intelligence: Morning Briefing

Activate the automated morning briefing system for daily job search intelligence.

### What You Get (7:00–7:30 AM)

- **Part 1 (Roles):** New roles matching your criteria, scored by fit, prioritized for tailoring
- **Part 2 (Networking):** Follow-ups owed, referral opportunities, warm intro paths surfaced
- **Part 3 (Coaching):** Pipeline health snapshot, bottleneck detection, today's skill coaching

### How to Activate

1. **Option A (Recommended):** Claude Desktop Cowork → Set up scheduled task for 7:00 AM daily
   - See `setup/morning-briefing-setup.md` for detailed instructions
2. **Option B (Manual):** Run `/briefing-part1-roles` → wait → `/briefing-part2-networking` → wait → `/briefing-part3-coaching`
3. **Option C (Shell script):** Use `cowork-tasks/` files as templates for local automation

### Files Referenced
- `cowork-tasks/daily-morning-briefing.md` — Master briefing coordinator
- `cowork-tasks/briefing-part1-roles.md` — New roles + scoring
- `cowork-tasks/briefing-part2-networking.md` — Networking intelligence
- `cowork-tasks/briefing-part3-coaching.md` — Pipeline health + coaching
- `briefings/` — Where generated briefings are saved

## How to Use This System

### Session Flow (20-30 min standard)

1. **Warm-up (1 min):** Paste a JD or company name
2. **Vet (5 min):** Run `/quick-start` or `/job-fit-scorer` — decide if worth pursuing
3. **Prepare (10 min):** Tailor resume with `/resume-tailor`, draft HM outreach with `/hiring-manager-msg`, or create work product with `/work-product`
4. **Execute:** Send the application, message, or work product
5. **Log (2 min):** Update `context-library/interview-history.md` with outcome

### Weekly Rhythm

- **Monday:** Review target companies, prioritize outreach (10 min)
- **Tuesday–Thursday:** 20-30 min each day on applications, messages, work products
- **Friday:** Run `/weekly-retro` to assess pipeline and patterns (20 min)

### Compounds Over Time

- **Week 1:** Populate context library, practice `/resume-tailor`
- **Week 2–4:** 20-30 interviews in early pipeline
- **Week 5–8:** Interviews advancing, patterns emerging. Use `/interview-prep` and `/weekly-retro` to tighten approach
- **Week 9+:** Interviews reaching final rounds. Use `/negotiate` when offers land

## Three Laws for Output

Every skill output follows these principles:

1. **Honest gaps.** If you don't have evidence for a requirement, we say so. No fabrication.
2. **Actionable specificity.** "Mention your leadership in the cover letter" is vague. "In your cover letter, write: 'I led cross-functional teams across 3 products…'" is actionable.
3. **Traceability.** Every resume bullet, every interview question, every recommendation traces back to your context files or to public research.

---

## Important Constraints

- **Real experience only.** Skills draw exclusively from your experience library. If a gap exists, the OS flags it.
- **No generic output.** If context files are sparse, the system tells you to fill them first. Blank libraries produce blank resumes.
- **No spray-and-pray.** The system is designed for 50-100 quality applications over 12 weeks, not 500 applications over 2 weeks.
- **Privacy.** Your context files stay local. Nothing is sent to external APIs unless you explicitly request research.
