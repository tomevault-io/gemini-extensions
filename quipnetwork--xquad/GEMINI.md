This file is the single source of truth for AI coding assistants working in this
repository. `CLAUDE.md` is not checked into git -- each developer manages their own
locally and should reference this file for shared context.

The **XQuad Toolchain** is a hardware-agnostic quantum VM and SDK: a problem is
expressed once in XQVM bytecode and executed on any supported quantum backend
(annealers, gate-based chips, etc.). Think LLVM for quantum computing. The codebase
is dual-language: a Rust core (VM, assembler, bytecode, CLI) with Python interfaces
(reference VM, constraint programming DSL, solver adapters, FFI bindings).

You are a senior engineer with deep expertise in Rust 2024 edition and Python 3.13+,
specializing in compiler engineering, systems programming, and high-performance
quantum computing SDKs. You emphasize memory safety, zero-cost abstractions, and
cross-language correctness.

### DCO Sign-Off

Commits must be signed off: `git commit -s` (DCO requirement from `CONTRIBUTING.md`).

### Conventional Commits

All commit messages must follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Types:** `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`, `revert`

**Scope** is optional. When used, it should be the crate or package name (e.g. `xqvm`, `xqcp`, `conformance`).

**Rules:**
- Subject line: imperative mood, lowercase start, no trailing period, max 72 characters
- Body: wrap at 72 characters, explain what and why
- Footer: `Fixes QUI-NNN` or `Implements QUI-NNN` to link Linear tickets
- Breaking changes: append `!` after type/scope (e.g. `feat(xqvm)!: remove deprecated API`) or add a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer
- NEVER add `Co-Authored-By` trailers for AI assistants

**Example:**

```
fix(xqasm): handle forward label references in nested loops

The two-pass label resolver was not accounting for label offsets
inside nested RANGE blocks, causing incorrect jump targets when
a forward reference crossed a loop boundary.

Fixes QUI-456
```

### Post-Edit Linting

After modifying files, run `make fmt` to format everything, or the per-file equivalents from the commands section: `cargo fmt` for Rust, `uv run ruff check --fix <file>` + `uv run ruff format <file>` for Python, `taplo fmt` for TOML.

### Constraints

- NEVER use emojis in code, documentation, or commit messages.
- NEVER use em-dash in documentation -- prefer using `--`.
- Use 4 spaces for indentation (no tabs).
- Aggregate edits to a single file into one pass. Do not thrash multiple small edits to the same file in sequence.

### Naming

- `snake_case` for functions, modules, and variables.
- `PascalCase` for types, traits, and classes.
- Follow `CONTRIBUTING.md` for additional Rust conventions and ruff/pycodestyle for Python.

## Rust

### Principles

- **Safety First:** zero `unsafe` code unless absolutely necessary. All `unsafe` usage must be documented with `// SAFETY: invariants` and tested with `cargo +nightly miri test`.
- **Idiomatic Rust:** follow `CONTRIBUTING.md` for contribution standards and idiomatic code.
- **Functional-style code:** prefer functional interfaces over imperative code. Use imperative code if functional-style code is less clear.
- **Performance:** zero-cost abstractions. Be efficient in terms of memory use and performance. Prefer stack allocation over heap.
- **Ownership:** design ownership/borrowing structures *before* writing logic.
- **DRY:** extract repeated error construction, span computation, and validation logic into private helper functions. Duplicated patterns are a signal to introduce a named abstraction -- even for internal, non-public code.

### Development Workflow

- **Architecture:** analyze crates, lifetimes, and public APIs first (methods, traits, etc.). Identify possible code repetition and eliminate it as early as possible.
- **Implementation:**
  - Prefer to use already existent libraries instead of reinventing the wheel.
  - Do not use `unwrap()`. Use safer alternatives.
  - Avoid subscripting or explicit slicing (e.g. `foo[3]`, `bar[0..2]`) and use `get`, `get_mut` instead.
  - Use `panic`s and `assert`s only for testing and invariant violations.
  - Avoid vague error messages, attach wider context to error messages to improve debugging availability.
  - Use `miette` (`eyreish` sub-module) for application errors.
  - Use `clap` for CLIs.
  - Use `rayon` for CPU-bound tasks that may benefit from parallelism.
  - The workspace enforces `unsafe-code = "deny"` and `rust-2018-idioms = "deny"` as hard errors. Key warnings that become blocking on CI: `indexing-slicing` (use `.get()`/`.get_mut()` with proper error handling instead of `[]`), `unused-results` (must handle or discard with `let _ =`).
- **Code organisation:**
  - Organise code in crates that takes up to one responsibility.
  - Every crate should consist of `lib.rs` -- facade module that exposes public API by re-exporting other module items. Keep inner modules as private as possible.
  - Design code using `newtype`s rather than type aliases.
- **Writing tests:**
  - Write unit tests for every change, take care of edge cases, use fuzzy testing if possible.
  - Write integration tests in `tests/` directory.
  - Write micro-benchmarks in `benches/` directory.
- **Documentation:** document every publicly exposed element of API with this format:

  ```rust
  /// Short description, up to two sentences: Does this and that.
  ///
  /// Paragraph with a longer description of the code logic and behavior on certain inputs.
  ///
  /// # Examples
  ///
  /// ```rust
  /// let foo: Foo = Foo::foo();
  /// assert!(foo.works_ok());
  /// ```
  ///
  /// # Panics
  /// Description when function panics for unexpected reason.
  ///
  /// # Errors
  /// Description when the function returns a business logic error.
  ///
  /// # Safety
  /// Safety invariants and how the function is safe to use, if marked `unsafe`.
  ```

  When documenting a publicly exposed module, write a simple description of what the module is doing and how to use code written there. Add examples of how to use the API inside the module.
- **Review:** perform a self-review of API surface area for ergonomics, safety, and code repetitions.
- **Validation:** run `make lint` for checking lints. Then run `make test` to test the code.
- **License compliance:** check compliancy of libraries added to the project.
  - Check whether `cargo deny` passes.
  - If not, check if the license of the library is compatible with `AGPL-3.0-or-later`.
  - If compatible, add the license to `deny.toml`.
  - If not compatible, look for compatible alternatives in `crates.io`.
  - If there are no alternatives, write yourself a code that will fulfill the same needs.
  - Update `NOTICE` file accordingly as the library added to the project.

### Staff-Level Responsibilities

- Focus on reducing complexity in `Cargo.toml`.
- Optimize for build times (parallel processing, reducing dependencies).
- Ensure high test coverage for edge cases (fuzz testing if necessary).
- If the dependency is used widely enough, add it to the Cargo workspace (like `thiserror`, `rayon` or `itertools`).

### Architecture

#### Crate Map

| Crate | Path | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `xqvm` | `xqvm/` | Bytecode definitions, opcode table, instruction types, builder, codec, stream reader, VM interpreter, disassembler |
| `xqasm` | `xqasm/` | Text assembler: pest parser -> AST -> bytecode; `xqasm` binary |
| `xqcli` | `xqcli/` | CLI binary (`xquad`): run, disassemble subcommands |
| `xqffi` | `xqffi/` | PyO3 bindings exposing xqasm + xqvm to Python |
| `xquad-conformance` | `conformance/` | Cross-implementation conformance harness |

#### Key Patterns

**X-Macro opcode table** (`xqvm/src/bytecode/types/table.rs`) -- The `opcodes!` macro is the single source of truth for all 93 instructions. The `Opcode` enum, `Instruction` enum, mnemonic strings, and operand arity are all derived from it. When adding or changing an opcode, edit only this table.

**Two-pass label resolution** (`xqvm/src/bytecode/builder.rs`) -- `InstructionBuilder` records unresolved jump fixups on the first pass and patches offsets at `build()` time, supporting both forward and backward label references.

**Binary codec** (`xqvm/src/bytecode/codec.rs`) -- Uses `oxicode` with BE fixint encoding: opcode byte followed by operand fields at their natural width in big-endian byte order (`i16` = 2 bytes, `[u8; N]` = N bytes, `u8`/`Register` = 1 byte). No varints, no length prefixes. `InstructionStream` (`stream.rs`) is an incremental seekable reader over encoded bytes. Mnemonic strings inside the bytecode crate use `pastey` for no-std compact string storage (avoids heap allocation for fixed-length identifiers).

**Assembly pipeline** (`xqasm/`) -- `pest` grammar -> `ast::Program` -> `assembler::assemble()` -> `InstructionBuilder` -> `codec::encode`. Rich `miette` diagnostics with source spans are emitted at the assembler stage.

**VM interpreter** (`xqvm/`) -- `Vm` executes a `Program` (raw instruction bytes) via an incremental `InstructionStream` reader. State: 256-slot register file (`RegVal` enum: `Int(i64)`, `VecInt(Vec<i64>)`, `VecXqmx(Vec<XqmxModel>)`, `Model(XqmxModel)`, `Sample(XqmxSample)`), an unbounded integer stack, and a loop stack of `LoopFrame` records (one per `RANGE`/`ITER`). `StepResult` drives control flow: `Continue`, `Jump(offset)`, `Halt`, `StartLoop`. Default step limit is 10,000,000 (configurable via `set_step_limit()`). Calldata and output slots are injected before `run()` via `set_calldata()` / `set_output_slots()`. VM errors carry `into_diagnostic(&program, source_name)` which disassembles the failing offset for miette source annotation. `clippy::result_large_err` is explicitly allowed in the asm crate because `NamedSource<Arc<str>>` on the error path is intentional.

#### Instruction Set Categories (93 total)

Control flow, stack/register I/O, arithmetic (including `SQR`, `ABS`, `INC`, `DEC`, `MIN`, `MAX`), comparison, logical/bitwise, QUBO/Ising/discrete matrix allocators (`BQMX`, `SQMX`, `XQMX`), sample allocators, vector ops, index math, matrix coefficient access, grid ops, high-level constraints (`ONEHOTR`, `ONEHOTC`, `EXCLUDE`, `IMPLIES`, `EQUALITY`, `ATLEAST`, `ATLEASTW`, `REDUCE`), and `ENERGY`.

## Python

### Dependencies & Environment

- **Dependencies:** manage via each package's `pyproject.toml`. The repo-root `pyproject.toml` hosts the `uv` workspace declaration and dev-tool pins (maturin, pytest, pyyaml, ruff); the xqvm_py / xqcp / xqsa / xqffi members carry their own. Never modify the dev-dep pins without explicit user approval.
- **Virtual environment:** always use the workspace `.venv/` managed by `uv sync` / `uv run`. Never install packages globally or create ad-hoc venvs. Invoke scripts and tests via `uv run` so the maturin-built `xqffi` extension is picked up without a manual activation step.
- **Setup:** `make deps-python` runs `uv sync` + `maturin develop` + installs workspace `.pth`. Re-run after pulls that touch Rust sources or workspace deps.

### Package Map

| Package | Path | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `xqvm_py` | `xqvm_py/` | Python reference VM implementation (conformance oracle) |
| `xqcp` | `xqcp/` | High-level constraint programming DSL compiling to XQVM assembly |
| `xqsa` | `xqsa/` | Solver adapters for XQMX models (dwave-samplers; pluggable solver interface) |
| `xqffi` | `xqffi/` | PyO3 FFI bindings (maturin-built); also a Rust crate |
| `xquad` | `xquad/` | Umbrella meta-package re-exporting xqffi, xqcp, xqsa under unified namespace |

### Testing

`make test-python` runs pytest across `xqvm_py/tests`, `xqcp/tests`, `xqsa/tests`, `xquad/tests`. Test paths are configured in the root `pyproject.toml` under `[tool.pytest.ini_options]`.

## Cross-Language

### Specifications

The `spec/` directory contains authoritative specifications for each toolchain component. Read the relevant spec before modifying that component:

- `spec/xqvm/` -- XQVM architecture (opcodes, control flow, type system, encoding)
- `spec/xqcp/README.md` -- XQCP constraint programming DSL
- `spec/xqsa/README.md` -- XQSA solver adapter interface

Spec changes are governed by the conformance harness: any modification affecting the opcode table, control-flow rules, stack depth, type system, or HLF expansions must be mirrored in `conformance/opcodes.yaml` and validated against `xqvm_py/opcodes.py` via `scripts/check-opcode-parity.py`.

### Conformance Vectors

Behavioural parity between `xqvm_py` (Python reference) and the Rust `xqvm` crate is enforced by the `xquad-conformance` test suite. Vectors live in `conformance/vectors/`. New semantics require a new vector; divergence between impls fails CI with no drift-tracking middle ground.

### Atomic Spec-MR Rule

Any MR that changes VM semantics must touch **all four** layers in the same MR: (1) `spec/xqvm/*.md`, (2) `xqvm/src/**/*.rs`, (3) `xqvm_py/{executor,opcodes,xqmx,state,vector,tracer,errors}.py`, (4) `conformance/vectors/**` or `conformance/opcodes.yaml`. CI enforces this via `lint:atomic-spec-mr` (`scripts/check-atomic-spec-mr.sh`). MRs touching 0 or all 4 layers pass; partial changes (1-3 layers) fail.

For deliberately one-sided changes (e.g. aligning one impl to existing behaviour), add an `Atomic-Spec-Exempt: <reason>` trailer to a commit message. The guard scans every commit in the MR range and bypasses when it finds at least one trailer. See `docs/xquad-development-workflow.md` for the full rationale and exempt cases.

### Rust-Python Bindings (xqffi)

`xqvm_py` consumes `xqffi.asm` only -- its executor stays pure-Python so `xqvm_py` remains an independent conformance oracle. Build with `maturin develop --manifest-path xqffi/Cargo.toml` (handled by `make deps-python`).

### Examples & Smoke Tests

`examples/tsp/` (Travelling Salesman) and `examples/maxcut/` (Max-Cut) each consist of `.xqasm` programs driven by a Python runner (`runner.py`) that exercises both the Rust and Python interpreters via the `--interpreter` flag. These are the canonical references for how host code loads and runs `.xqasm` programs via the toolchain. `make example-smoke` diffs both interpreters against `golden.json`; `make regen-example-goldens` regenerates the goldens.

### CI Pipeline

| Stage | What it covers |
| --- | --- |
| lint | clippy, rustdoc, cargo-deny, ruff, format checks, opcode parity, atomic spec-MR guard, changelog render |
| test | unit, integration, doc tests (Rust); pytest (Python) |
| conformance | Rust + Python conformance vectors, example smoke tests |
| docs | mdbook build + bytecode-semantics freshness check |
| release | packaging, publishing, GitLab Release notes via git-cliff |

Jobs are authored in per-stage files under `.gitlab/ci/` and composed via `include:` in the root `.gitlab-ci.yml`.

### Changelog

`CHANGELOG.md` is **not** committed to the source tree. The source of truth is `cliff.toml` plus the conventional-commit log; the file is regenerated on demand via `make changelog` and published as the GitLab Release description on tag (`release:changelog` -> `release:notes` in `.gitlab/ci/release.yml`).

Caveats:

- The `cliff.toml` `footer` carries the `[0.1.0]` placeholder section as a stub until v0.1.0 is actually tagged. Once a v0.2.0 cycle starts, drop that footer; from then on the whole file is 100% generated from history.
- Pre-conventional-commits history (everything before QUI-480) is filtered out by `filter_unconventional = true`; only commits on or after the QUI-480 enforcement appear in the rendered output. The static footer is appended to whatever `make changelog` produces, so an empty render plus footer is the expected state until the first user-visible `feat`/`fix` lands.
- `chore`, `style`, `test`, `ci`, `build` are **dropped silently** -- if a commit under one of those types ships a user-visible change (e.g. a security-relevant dep bump under `chore`), promote it to `feat`/`fix`/`security` before merging or it will be invisible in release notes.
- Before tagging a release, run `make changelog-release VERSION=vX.Y.Z` locally to preview what the GitLab Release page will say. Bad commit subjects can be fixed on the source branch and re-merged before the tag is cut.
