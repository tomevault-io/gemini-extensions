### Methodology
- Follow the user’s requirements carefully & to the letter.
- First think step-by-step - describe your plan for what to build in pseudocode, written out in great detail.
- Confirm, then write code!
- Always write correct, best practice, DRY principle (Dont Repeat Yourself), bug free, fully functional and working code also it should be aligned to listed rules down below at Code Implementation Guidelines .
- Focus on easy and readability code, over being performant.
- Fully implement all requested functionality.
- Leave NO todo’s, placeholders or missing pieces.
- Ensure code is complete! Verify thoroughly finalised.
- Include all required imports, and ensure proper naming of key components.
- Be concise Minimize any other prose.
- If you think there might not be a correct answer, you say so.
- If you do not know the answer, say so, instead of guessing.

### Code Style and Structure
- Use **TypeScript** for all project files for strong typing and IDE benefits.
- Follow **functional programming and declarative programming patterns**:
- Avoid using classes or overly imperative code.
- Utilize pure functions and modern React hooks effectively.
- Always write concise and clean TypeScript code with meaningful and descriptive variable names:
- Example: Use `isLoading`, `hasCompleted`, `fetchHabits` for clear intent.
- Avoid abbreviations or unclear names.
- Use a component-first design:
- Break the UI into small, reusable components.
- Write atomic components first, then combine them into larger molecules.
- Only export what is necessary from a module; avoid default exports.
- Use **consistent file naming conventions**:
- Lowercase with dashes for directories and files (e.g., `components/habit-tracker`).
- CamelCase for component and file exports (e.g., `HabitTracker`).
- Write modular code: avoid repetitive code by abstracting common patterns into reusable helpers or components.

### Directory Structure
Organize the project for clarity and scalability:
```
├── public/                 # Publicly accessible files
├── src/
│   ├── app/                # Next.js App Directory

└── tailwind.config.js      # TailwindCSS configuration
```

### UI and Styling
- Use **TailwindCSS** for all component styling. Avoid inline CSS or traditional global styles except for resets and utility purposes.
- Components should leverage **ShadCN UI** with **Radix Primitives** for interactive and accessible elements (e.g., dialogs, tooltips, dropdowns).
- Styling guidelines:
- Mobile-first approach: prioritize responsive layouts for small screens.
- Use only **@apply** for reusable patterns and avoid defining new utility classes unnecessarily.
- Use consistent design tokens within Tailwind configuration for predictable styling (e.g., colors, spacing, typography).
- Example for a UI Component:
```tsx
import { cn } from "@/lib/utils";
interface ButtonProps extends React.ButtonHTMLAttributes<HTMLButtonElement> {
variant?: "primary" | "secondary";
}
export const Button = ({ variant = "primary", ...props }: ButtonProps) => (
<button
className={cn(
"px-4 py-2 font-medium rounded transition",
variant === "primary" ? "bg-blue-500 text-white" : "bg-gray-200 text-black"
)}
{...props}
/>
);
```

### State Management
- Use the **React Context API** for global app state, such as:
- User authentication (`AuthContext`).
- Date or habit tracking filters (`DateContext`).
- Custom hooks should abstract logic (e.g., `useAuth`, `useDatePicker`).
- Avoid third-party state managers (e.g., Redux, MobX) unless scaling demands require it.
- Use **local component state** for ephemeral data (e.g., input field states, modal visibility).

### Routing
- Use the file-based routing system in the `app/` directory.
- Nested routes must have a clear hierarchy with layouts used for shared components:
- Example: `/dashboard/tracker` views extend `/dashboard/layout.tsx`.
- Authenticate protected routes via `_middleware`.

### Supabase Integration
- All database queries or calls should be wrapped into service functions located in `services/`.
- Always use parameterized queries to prevent injection or performance issues.
- **Supabase Client Configuration**:
- Centralized setup in `lib/supabaseClient.ts` to ensure consistency across all calls.
```ts
import { createClient } from "@supabase/supabase-js";
export const supabase = createClient(
process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!,
process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_KEY!
);
```

### Error Handling and Validation
- Implement proactive early returns for error handling to reduce deeply nested code:
- Validate inputs with **Zod** schemas rather than manual logic.
- Use centralized error handlers to catch all API/service errors.
- Example:
```ts
import * as z from "zod";
const schema = z.object({
email: z.string().email(),
});
try {
schema.parse({ email });
} catch (e) {
console.error(e);
}
```

### Performance and Security
- Use **React Server Components (RSC)** where applicable to reduce client-side complexity.
- Prefer SSR and SSG over CSR where relevant to improve SEO and initial page load times.
- Optimize images using the `next/image` component with lazy loading and `WebP` format.
- Do not expose sensitive Supabase API keys on the client (only use `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` for public configuration).
- Ensure environment variables are documented and loaded securely.

### Testing and Documentation
- Write **unit tests** for components using Jest and React Testing Library.
- Each service function must have integration tests with mock Supabase responses.
- Document:
- Each major component with inline comments describing purpose and props.
- Custom hooks must include example usage at the top of the file.
- Use `README.md` for project-wide documentation.

### Naming Conventions
- **Directories and Files**: Use lowercase with hyphens.
- **Components**: Use PascalCase.
- **Functions and Variables**: Use camelCase.
- **Environment Variables**: Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE.
```markdown
Example:
src/
components/
habit-tracker/
HabitTracker.tsx
```

### Deployment
- Deploy on **Vercel** with automatic CI/CD for each `main`/`production` branch update.
- Test changes thoroughly in staging environments before promotion to production.

### General Guidelines
- Always refer to the product documentation that is written in markdown documents in the docs/ directory in the project root.
