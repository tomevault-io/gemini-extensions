# uploads

File-hosting backend for **uploads.sh**. Provider-agnostic storage via
[files-sdk](https://files-sdk.dev), deployed to Cloudflare Workers with
Wrangler. The service is public: anyone can sign up, create a workspace, and
use the CLI, and paid plans are live.

## Layout

The path-by-path inventory lives in the README's
[What's in this repo](README.md#whats-in-this-repo) table — one copy, so it
can't drift. `packages/uploads` also ships `uploads mcp`, a stdio MCP server
mirroring the CLI commands.

Three agent skills are checked in at the repo root so they're installable via
the `npx skills add` convention (and by `uploads install`):
`skills/github-screenshots` is the thin workflow skill (when a screenshot or
recording should go into a PR/issue or be shared as a link — the in-repo
successor to the external `github-screenshots` skill's bundled R2 scripts),
`skills/annotate-screenshots` covers callouts and redaction
(`uploads annotate` / `screenshot --annotate`), and `skills/uploads-cli` is
the full CLI reference the others defer to. Keep all three in sync when the
CLI's commands or flags change.

**Screenshots: stage as you go.** If your change is visually observable (web
UI, email templates, rendered output), capture and stage screenshots at each
milestone while you work — don't wait for a PR to exist. A bare `uploads put`
already stages by default on a non-default git branch (issue #403), and a
bare `uploads screenshot` (no `--pr`/`--issue`/`--branch`) does the same
(issue #469) — carrying its derived metadata (`path`/`url`/`env`/`viewport`,
plus `--state`) through to the PR once it opens; reach for `attach --branch`
when you want its extras (multiple files in one call, or triggering
promotion/comment sync as a side effect):

```bash
uploads put ./after.png --meta path=/settings --state after   # before|after|empty|error|loading
uploads screenshot http://localhost:4321/settings --out after.png --state after
uploads attach ./after.png --branch --state after              # explicit form, either way
```

Opening a PR automatically promotes everything staged for the branch into one
managed comment (via the GitHub App webhook, or the next `uploads attach` /
`uploads attach --promote` without it). See `skills/github-screenshots` for
the full workflow.

Keep API and web separate deployables. All storage access goes through
`createStorage()` in `packages/storage` — never import files-sdk adapters or
touch the R2 binding directly from route code. Adding a provider = a new case
in `createStorage` plus its files-sdk peer deps.

## Commands

```bash
pnpm bootstrap           # one-command local setup (tooling, deps, env, types, D1, default workspace)
pnpm doctor              # read-only diagnose of the local setup
pnpm install
pnpm dev                 # API on :8787 (local R2 + KV + D1 simulation)
pnpm dev:web             # Astro site
pnpm typecheck           # wrangler types + tsc across workspaces
pnpm test                # whole suite in one vitest process (all packages); CI's Test job runs this
pnpm test:api            # single package (also test:mcp / test:auth / test:web / test:cli;
                         # uses vitest defaults, not the root config)
pnpm build:cli           # build @buildinternet/uploads without the --filter incantation
pnpm run deploy          # all workers; or deploy:api / deploy:web / deploy:mcp
pnpm workspace:add <name> [--bucket <bucket>] [--binding X] [--local] \
  [--no-default-limits] [--max-storage …]   # shared/agent limit template by default
pnpm workspace:limits <name> [--max-storage …] [--max-video-bytes …] \
  [--allowed-prefixes default|f,screenshots,gh] [--max-key-depth 8] \
  [--clear-max-storage] [--clear-allowed-prefixes] […]
pnpm migrate:d1:local    # apply apps/api/migrations to local D1 (migrate:d1 = remote)
pnpm uploads put <file> --env-file .env   # monorepo only: builds package first
pnpm uploads put <file> --pr <num>
```

**CLI examples — installed binary vs monorepo:** product-facing examples
(PR “how to try it”, skill docs, issue comments, user-facing README snippets)
use the global binary as someone who already installed the CLI would:

```bash
uploads put ./shot.png
uploads put ./after.png --pr 123
```

Reserve `pnpm uploads …` for **in-repo** development (build-from-source via the
root script). Do not assume readers have the monorepo checked out.

Use `pnpm run deploy` (not bare `pnpm deploy` — that's pnpm's built-in).
`deploy:api` applies pending D1 migrations (`migrate:d1`) before
`wrangler deploy`. On merge to main, `.github/workflows/d1-migrations.yml`
also applies remote migrations when `apps/api/migrations/**` changes
(secrets: `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`, `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`). Production
worker deploys normally happen via Workers Builds on push to main. For an
isolated branch environment, `npx wrangler preview` from an app directory —
playbook in [docs/previews.md](docs/previews.md); the Workers Builds bot's
"Branch Preview URL" on PRs is a different, legacy mechanism that runs
against production bindings.

Operator runbook: [docs/ops.md](docs/ops.md). Daily retention cron on the API
worker; BYO secrets use `WORKSPACE_SECRETS_KEY`, set on both `uploads-api` and
`uploads-mcp`; bare upload keys get `f/<id>/…`.

### Local Wrangler / agent hygiene

`wrangler … --local` boots miniflare and can **orphan + balloon RAM** (multi‑GB)
if the parent shell/agent dies mid-command or the process hangs in an error
path. Prefer:

- **`pnpm doctor` / `pnpm bootstrap`** for “is local `default` registered?” —
  they check miniflare’s on-disk SQLite first and only fall back to a
  **time-bounded** wrangler call (`scripts/lib-local.sh`).
- **`pnpm workspace:add` / `workspace:limits` / `migrate:d1:local`** go through
  `apps/api/scripts/run-timed.mjs` (local get/put ~30–60s, D1 migrate 60s).
  Do not reimplement bare `execFileSync(wrangler … --local)`.
- When you must run wrangler yourself, wrap it in the timed runner:  
  `node apps/api/scripts/run-timed.mjs 20 -- pnpm --filter @uploads/api exec wrangler kv key get ws:default --binding REGISTRY --local`
- Never leave bare `wrangler kv|d1 … --local` running in the background. If an
  agent times out a command, **kill the process group** (`pkill -f 'wrangler.*--local'`
  only after confirming PIDs), not just the shell wrapper.

See [docs/ops.md](docs/ops.md#local-wrangler-gotchas).

### Releasing `@buildinternet/uploads` (changesets)

User-visible CLI/client/MCP package changes need a `.changeset/*.md` file
(`pnpm changeset` or hand-written). Two rules prevent damage: only
`"@buildinternet/uploads": patch|minor|major` goes in the header (a changeset
naming a private `@uploads/*` package yields an empty version PR and blocks the
next publish), and never hand-edit that package's `version`. Full process —
trusted publishing, cutting a release, recovery — is in
[docs/releasing.md](docs/releasing.md).

Run `pnpm types` (or `pnpm --filter @uploads/{api,mcp,web} types`) after any
`wrangler.jsonc` change — `Env` is generated into `worker-configuration.d.ts`,
never hand-written. CI and the pre-commit hook both run `pnpm types` before
type-aware oxlint for this reason.

## Workspaces (multi-tenant model)

All API routes are workspace-scoped: `/v1/:workspace/files/...`. A workspace
is a tenant record in the `REGISTRY` KV namespace (`ws:<name>` →
`WorkspaceRecord`, see `apps/api/src/workspace.ts`) carrying its provider,
bucket, optional R2 binding name, optional `publicBaseUrl`, optional S3
credentials, and the SHA-256 hash of its bearer token. Register workspaces
with `apps/api/scripts/add-workspace.mjs` (`--local` for dev KV). Never treat
any workspace as special in code — even `default` is just a registered tenant.

By default a workspace is a **`<name>/` prefix in the shared `uploads-default`
bucket** (binding `UPLOADS_DEFAULT`, public at `https://storage.uploads.sh`):
the record carries `prefix: "<name>/"` and creating one is a pure KV write.
The prefix is applied in exactly one place — `createStorage()` in
`packages/storage` (files-sdk instance prefix) — so route code and clients
never see it; public URLs are `https://storage.uploads.sh/<name>/<key>`.
The same keys are also served on `https://embed.uploads.sh/<name>/<key>` with
freshness-oriented Cache-Control (zone Transform Rule) for GitHub Camo; API/CLI
return `embedUrl` alongside `url` — prefer embed for PR/issue markdown. See
[docs/ops.md](docs/ops.md#dual-public-hosts-stable-vs-embed--github-camo).
Bring-your-own-bucket is the advanced case: register with `--bucket` and the
record points at a dedicated bucket (own binding or S3 credentials, own
`publicBaseUrl`, no prefix) — `buildinternet` on `buildinternet-dev` is the
reference example.

R2 workspaces have **two credential paths on the same bucket**:

1. **Workers binding** (record's `binding` names an `r2_buckets` entry in
   `wrangler.jsonc`) — reads/writes, no egress, no keys. Same-account buckets.
2. **Bucket-scoped S3 credentials** (in the workspace record) — presigning,
   or full HTTP-mode I/O for buckets with no binding (other accounts).

Secrets never go in `wrangler.jsonc` or source: workspace secrets live in KV
records; any future global secrets go through `wrangler secret put` (prod) or
`.dev.vars` (local, gitignored).

## Conventions

- `pnpm check` runs `oxlint` then `format:check` (oxfmt + Prettier for
  `*.astro`). Autofix with `pnpm lint:fix` / `pnpm format`. CI runs the same
  gate in the **Lint & Format** job (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`), after
  `pnpm types` so gitignored `worker-configuration.d.ts` files exist for
  type-aware rules.
- Three `unicorn` rules are off in `.oxlintrc.json` because their **autofixes**
  are wrong here, not because their advice is: `prefer-set-has` rewrites an
  array literal to `new Set(...)` without touching the variable's type
  annotation, which stops compiling; `no-array-sort` and `no-array-reverse`
  fire on this codebase's `[...arr].sort(...)` idiom, which already copies, so
  their `toSorted`/`toReversed` rewrite just adds a second copy. oxlint's
  `--fix` flags are global, so there is no way to keep a rule's diagnostic
  while suppressing only its fix. If you re-enable any of them, re-check that
  `pnpm lint:fix` still leaves a clean tree.
- `oxc/no-async-endpoint-handlers` is off because it is an Express 4 rule
  (unhandled rejections from `async` route handlers). This repo is Hono on
  Workers; Hono awaits handlers and `onError` catches throws. The diagnostic
  is a false positive on every `app.post(..., async (c) => …)` middleware.
- A Husky pre-commit hook runs `pnpm types` then `lint-staged` (oxlint + oxfmt
  on staged files; Prettier for `*.astro` — oxfmt has no Astro parser); it's
  installed via the `prepare` script on `pnpm install`.
- TypeScript strict, ESM only, `lib: ["ES2022"]` (no DOM — the Workers types
  own globals like `crypto.subtle.timingSafeEqual`).
- Auth is per-workspace bearer tokens, hashed + timing-safe compare, with
  uniform 401s so workspace names can't be enumerated — see
  `apps/api/src/workspace.ts`.
- HTTP errors: throw `AppError` subclasses from `@uploads/errors` and let
  `respondError` / Hono `onError` serialize the nested envelope
  `{ error: { code, type, message, details? } }`. Never hand-roll
  `c.json({ error: "…" })`. Status is derived from `type` via `STATUS_BY_TYPE`.
- Object keys are validated (`badKey` in `routes/files.ts`); URL parsing
  normalizes dot segments before handlers run.
- Upload guardrails live in `apps/api/src/guards.ts`: a byte cap (default 25 MiB)
  enforced on `Content-Length` and post-buffer, and a content-type allowlist
  (images + mp4/webm, no SVG) verified by magic-byte sniffing — the stored
  content type comes from the bytes, never the client header. Defaults are
  overridable per workspace via `maxUploadBytes` / `allowedContentTypes` on the
  record. Mutating routes carry the `writeRateLimit` middleware, keyed by
  workspace against the `WRITE_LIMITER` Rate Limiting binding (`unsafe.bindings`
  in `wrangler.jsonc`); it no-ops when the binding is absent.
- Follow Cloudflare Workers best practices: no floating promises, no
  module-level request state, secrets never in config or source.
- Wire types (PR #896 pattern): a JSON response's type lives next to its
  serializer in the producing worker (usually inferred, e.g.
  `ReturnType<typeof fooResponse>`) and is exported through a `package.json`
  `exports` entry (`@uploads/api/admin-ui`,
  `@uploads/auth/oauth-client-serialize`). Consumers `import type` it —
  never re-declare the shape and cast `res.json() as T`. Shared modules must
  not reference the ambient `Env` global (each worker's
  `worker-configuration.d.ts` declares its own; the importer's wins and
  typecheck breaks) — extract Env-free serializer modules where needed.

## Codex subagents

Use project-scoped custom agents for independently parallel, bounded work:

- `uploads_explorer` for read-only architecture, code-path, and test discovery.
- `uploads_reviewer` for read-only review of correctness, tenant isolation,
  upload security, and release risks.
- `uploads_implementer` for one isolated code change after the scope is clear.

For investigations and reviews, split independent questions between the
explorer and reviewer, wait for both, then consolidate their evidence before
changing code. Do not delegate routine small edits. Do not run concurrent
implementers against the same area; use a single implementer or partition
non-overlapping files explicitly. The root agent remains responsible for final
integration, tests, and user-facing decisions.

## Writing docs

House style for `docs/`, `README.md`, and web copy. It borrows the grammar
rules of ASD-STE100 Simplified Technical English — not the controlled
dictionary — to keep prose clear and free of AI-slop tics:

- **Active voice.** "A public CDN serves hosted files", not "Hosted files are
  served from a public CDN."
- **One idea per sentence.** Break anything past ~25 words. A single sentence
  chaining four clauses with em-dashes is the first thing to split.
- **Verbs, not nominalizations.** "When the sweep finalizes the delete", not
  "on the finalization of the delete."
- **One term per concept.** Never vary a technical name for elegance; call it
  the same thing every time (`workspace`, not "tenant" then "account").
- **Keep the article and the connective.** Don't drop "the"/"a"/"that" to
  sound terse.

But this is the softened form, not literal STE100 conformance: allow compound
sentences where the flow reads naturally, keep established idioms
("hash-free keys", "break-glass"), and keep the confident authorial voice
("Prefer X over Y"). Full one-instruction-per-sentence strictness is for true
step-by-step procedures (runbooks, setup walkthroughs), not reference or
rationale prose. Code blocks, tables, and identifiers stay verbatim.

## Pull requests

The PR shape (five sections) and title convention live in
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-requests). Read it before opening one.

What agents get wrong most often, so it bears repeating here:

- **Write for humans first**, not only for reviewers who already know the code.
  Lead with the problem and the outcome in plain language. Do not open with file
  paths, type names, or a flag list, and do not pad the description with a bullet
  dump of identifiers.
- **Show the installed CLI** (`uploads …`) in “how to try it” and in any
  post-merge “once this ships” example, including issue comments. Reserve
  `pnpm uploads …` for steps that are genuinely monorepo-only. Filter-style
  `pnpm --filter … test` is fine in a test plan — that section is repo context.
- **Do not auto-request CodeRabbit** on every PR. Org policy is on-demand only.
- **Do not merge “version packages” PRs** unless shipping is intentional.

## Environment files

- `.env.example` (repo root) — client vars (`UPLOADS_API_URL`,
  `UPLOADS_WORKSPACE`, `UPLOADS_TOKEN`), optional real R2 credentials for
  registering HTTP-mode dev workspaces, and `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` /
  `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` for headless deploys to any account (`pnpm deploy`
  loads the file via `node --env-file-if-exists`). Copy to `.env`, gitignored.
- `apps/api/.dev.vars.example` — the worker's local config (Workers
  convention). Currently empty of secrets; workspace secrets live in KV.
- `apps/web/.dev.vars.example` — overrides `UPLOADS_AUTH_ORIGIN` /
  `UPLOADS_API_ORIGIN` to point the signed-in shells (`/account/*`,
  `/admin/*`) at the local auth/API workers instead of the prod origins baked
  into `wrangler.jsonc` `vars`; no secrets.
- Never edit a user's `.env` / `.dev.vars` directly; template files only.

## Roadmap

See [docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md) for what is planned versus already shipped. Do not treat this file as the source of what exists.
