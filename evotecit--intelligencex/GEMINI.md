# IntelligenceX Agent Playbook

This file defines how automated agents should operate in this repo. Follow it for all changes and PR management.

**Core Rules**
- Use `gh` CLI for PR, review, and CI workflows.
- Work in a dedicated worktree + branch per task.
- Do not touch the Website PR or website work unless explicitly requested.
- Do not use destructive git commands (`reset --hard`, `checkout --`).

**Worktree + Branch**
1. Create a worktree for every task: `git worktree add -b <branch> <path> origin/master`.
2. Make changes only in that worktree.
3. Keep branches focused to a single change set.

**PR Review and CI**
1. List PRs: `gh pr list --repo EvotecIT/IntelligenceX --state open`.
2. Inspect details: `gh pr view <num> --repo EvotecIT/IntelligenceX`.
3. Check CI: `gh pr checks <num> --repo EvotecIT/IntelligenceX`.
4. Check for unresolved review threads when mergeability stays blocked after checks pass:
   - `gh api graphql -f query='query { repository(owner:"EvotecIT", name:"IntelligenceX") { pullRequest(number:<num>) { reviewThreads(first:100) { nodes { id isResolved isOutdated path line comments(first:10) { nodes { author { login } body url } } } } } } }'`
   - If branch protection requires conversation resolution, unresolved review threads are merge blockers even when the latest review summary says “safe to merge”.
   - Resolve stale threads only after verifying the underlying issue is truly addressed in code; do not auto-resolve live unresolved concerns.
5. If CI fails, inspect logs: `gh run view <run-id> --repo EvotecIT/IntelligenceX --log --job <job-id>`.
6. Classify CI failures before making code changes:
   - Actionable: compilation/test failures, lints, static analysis findings, reviewer bot blockers. Fix in code and re-run checks.
   - Infra-blocked: GitHub billing/spend-limit, runner capacity/unavailable, third-party premium/auth gating (Copilot/Claude/etc), or GitHub outage. Do not churn on code changes. Record the blocker and proceed per the PR Handling Loop infra rule.
7. Do not chase provider/auth diagnostics unless they cause a required check to fail (the reviewer workflow is designed to fail-open for many provider issues).
8. Rebase onto `origin/master` before merge if needed.
9. Merge only when all required checks pass and the PR is mergeable.
10. Merge with squash + delete branch: `gh pr merge <num> --repo EvotecIT/IntelligenceX --squash --delete-branch`.

**Dependabot + Workflow-Only PRs**
- On Dependabot PRs, comments may be authored by `github-actions` rather than the IntelligenceX GitHub App. This is expected: GitHub typically does not expose repo secrets (including app private keys) to Dependabot PR workflows.
- The IntelligenceX reviewer may intentionally skip PRs that only modify workflow files to avoid self-modifying workflow runs. If checks are green and the diff is limited to pin bumps (e.g., `uses:` SHA updates), treat this as mergeable unless maintainers explicitly require a manual review.
- Never touch `/.github/workflows/deploy-website.yml` unless explicitly requested (even when updating pinned action SHAs elsewhere).

**Local Preflight (Before You Push)**
To avoid bot/CI churn, run local checks before pushing when you touched runtime behavior or workflows.
1. Build: `dotnet build IntelligenceX.sln -c Release`
2. Tests: `dotnet test IntelligenceX.sln -c Release`
3. Harness (matches CI): `dotnet ./IntelligenceX.Tests/bin/Release/net8.0/IntelligenceX.Tests.dll`
4. Harness (matches CI): `dotnet ./IntelligenceX.Tests/bin/Release/net10.0/IntelligenceX.Tests.dll`
5. Reviewer static analysis (optional but useful when reviewer logic/templates change):
   - `dotnet run --project IntelligenceX.Cli/IntelligenceX.Cli.csproj --framework net8.0 -- analyze validate-catalog --workspace .`
   - `dotnet run --project IntelligenceX.Cli/IntelligenceX.Cli.csproj --framework net8.0 -- analyze run --config .intelligencex/reviewer.json --out artifacts --framework net8.0`

**PR Handling Loop (Required)**
When an agent is assigned a PR to improve or unblock, it must iterate until merge blockers are clean.

1. Read the latest IntelligenceX bot review comment and snapshot it (copy the raw Markdown to a scratchpad) so you can diff "before vs after" and avoid re-fixing the same item.
2. Treat these sections as merge blockers: `Todo List ✅` and `Critical Issues ⚠️`.
3. Treat `Other Issues 🧯` and `Next Steps 🚀` as non-blocking unless maintainers explicitly escalate them.
4. Triage other automated reviews (for example the “Claude Code Review” sticky comment) and fix anything that impacts correctness, security, or reliability.
5. Fix inline comments only when they map to merge blockers or correctness/security/reliability issues; ignore style-only nits from other bots unless maintainers explicitly escalate them.
6. Apply fixes in a single coherent batch (avoid micro-commits that "poke" the bot repeatedly), then re-run checks and re-check bot output:
   Run: `gh pr checks <num> --repo EvotecIT/IntelligenceX`
   If the bot posts new todo/critical items, repeat.
   Also verify unresolved review threads before declaring the PR merge-ready; if `gh pr view --json mergeStateStatus` still shows `BLOCKED` while checks are green, inspect `reviewThreads` and resolve only the stale addressed threads.
7. Infra-blocked escape hatch:
   - If required checks cannot run due to infra-blocked reasons (billing/spend limit, runner outage/capacity, third-party premium/auth gating), stop iterating.
   - Create a single tracking item (preferred: sync explicit bot checklist items into `TODO.md`, otherwise create a GitHub issue) with a link to the failed run/check.
   - Move on to the next PR only after the infra blocker is recorded, or maintainers explicitly decide to accept the risk.
8. Bot churn guard (to prevent endless "new items" that are just reworded or non-deterministic):
   - Only treat newly-introduced todo/critical items as blockers if they are clearly tied to the diff and are actionable/verifiable.
   - If the bot rewords the same issue across iterations, treat it as the same item and do not reopen it unless the underlying code regressed.
   - If an item is vague, style-only, or not reproducible after you applied a correct fix, record it in `TODO.md` (unchecked) with a link to the bot comment and stop chasing it in the PR unless maintainers explicitly escalate it.
9. Timebox rule (to prevent endless bot-chasing):
   - Default limit: 2 full iterations of the bot loop or 60 minutes per PR (whichever comes first).
   - If still blocked after the timebox, post a short status summary (what’s fixed, what’s left, why it’s hard) and wait for maintainer direction to continue.
10. Only move on to the next PR when the current PR has no remaining todo/critical blockers, or one of these is true:
   - maintainers explicitly decide to accept the risk
   - the PR is infra-blocked and recorded per step 7
   - the only remaining bot todo/critical items are classified as churn per step 8, recorded in `TODO.md`, and surfaced to maintainers in a status summary comment
11. Final merge gate:
   - Do not assume `mergeable` is enough.
   - Check `mergeStateStatus` via `gh pr view <num> --json mergeStateStatus,mergeable`.
   - If `mergeStateStatus` is `BLOCKED` with green checks, unresolved review threads are the first thing to inspect before looking for other policy causes.

**Commenting Hygiene (Avoid Shell Foot-Guns)**
- When posting PR comments from a shell, prefer `--body-file -` with a single-quoted heredoc to avoid accidental command substitution (for example backticks interpreted by zsh):
  - `cat <<'EOF' | gh pr comment <num> --repo EvotecIT/IntelligenceX --body-file -`
  - `...comment body here...`
  - `EOF`

**Review Feedback Backlog**
1. Aggregate bot review feedback using `gh api graphql`.
2. Preferred: run `intelligencex todo sync-bot-feedback` (or `dotnet run ... -- todo sync-bot-feedback`) to sync explicit checklist items into `TODO.md` and optionally create issues.
3. Track only explicit checklist items in `TODO.md`.
4. Group backlog by PR in `TODO.md` and keep it collapsed.
5. Avoid nested bullets in `TODO.md`.

**Documentation Hygiene**
- Keep TODO entries accurate: mark items done only when verified in code.
- When adding new items, include links to the originating comment or review.

**Docs Placement Guardrails (Website vs Internal)**
- Treat `Docs/` as public website content. If it should not appear on `https://intelligencex.dev/docs/`, do not place it in `Docs/`.
- Keep internal trackers, backlogs, migration notes, rollout logs, and maintainer playbooks in `InternalDocs/` (or another non-website path), not `Docs/`.
- Do not add draft/planning pages to `Docs/toc.json` unless maintainers explicitly requested that draft content be public.
- When moving content from `Docs/` to `InternalDocs/`, update `Docs/toc.json`, `Docs/_index.md`, and any cross-links in the same change set.

**Language-Neutral Routing Guardrails (Chat)**
- Do not gate chat routing or safety behavior on hardcoded natural-language keyword lists (for example English-only verbs like "disable", "run", "can't").
- Do not special-case compact follow-ups with literal phrases (for example "go ahead", "do it", "run it"). Continuation and nudge eligibility must be shape/context based.
- Do not assume ASCII-only punctuation in routing heuristics. Question/follow-up signals must stay Unicode-aware (for example `?`, `？`, `¿`, `؟`) and covered by tests.
- For pending-action and execution-contract decisions, prefer structured protocol fields (for example `ix_action_selection.mutating` and `ix:action:v1` `mutating: true|false`) over lexical inference from free text.
- For intent-token heuristics, keep script awareness: do not require English-like token lengths globally (for example, accept short non-Latin intent tokens when safe) and preserve tests for this behavior.
- If provider interoperability requires message-text matching, keep it as a structured-first fallback and do not reuse it for chat routing/confirmation logic.
- When changing Chat routing/safety logic, add or update tests that prove the behavior is language-agnostic.
- Replace repeated heuristic magic numbers with named constants in shared helpers/files to prevent drift between routing and confirmation paths.
- Keep `plan -> execute -> review` quality loops language-neutral too: review eligibility must use structure/shape signals (length, turn state, tool activity), not word lists.
- Preserve progress transparency for long turns: emit phase/status updates (including heartbeats for long model phases) instead of adding blocking confirmation gates.
- When proactive behavior is needed, use structured prompt markers (for example `ix:proactive-mode:v1` with `enabled: true|false`) instead of lexical intent detection.

**Testing**
- Run targeted `dotnet build` or tests if a change touches runtime behavior.
- Note any skipped tests and why.
- For Chat routing tests, prefer direct calls to `internal` helpers (via existing `InternalsVisibleTo`) instead of reflection against private methods.
- For streaming/status tests, avoid reading from actively-written streams; use synchronized snapshots or another thread-safe capture approach.

**Repo-Local Skills**
- Use repo skills from `/.agents/skills/README.md` for repeatable task execution.
- Preferred skills by task type:
  - Onboarding/setup UX and flows: `/.agents/skills/intelligencex-onboarding-setup/SKILL.md`
  - Reviewer bootstrap (`reviewer.json` + workflow YAML): `/.agents/skills/intelligencex-reviewer-bootstrap/SKILL.md`
  - First PR rollout verification: `/.agents/skills/intelligencex-first-pr-rollout/SKILL.md`
  - Analysis/catalog/gate work: `/.agents/skills/intelligencex-analysis-gate/SKILL.md`
  - PR unblock/merge loop: `/.agents/skills/intelligencex-pr-unblock-loop/SKILL.md`
  - Tool creation/refactor reuse loops: `/.agents/skills/intelligencex-tools-authoring/SKILL.md`
- Follow each skill's strict execution order and helper scripts before posting PR updates.
