# Five-Step Work Method

A universal decision framework that teaches you to evaluate **whether** to act before deciding **how** to act. Apply this to any decision — code, product, strategy, process, hiring, meetings, or resource allocation.

## When to Apply

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| New feature / product request | **Must apply** — Question need before designing |
| External feedback (multiple points) | **Must apply** — Evaluate each point independently |
| Bug fix that requires > 10 lines | **Must apply** — Question if the fix adds complexity |
| Process / workflow change proposal | **Must apply** — Can we delete the process instead? |
| New tool / vendor / hire decision | **Must apply** — Is the role/tool actually needed? |
| Meeting or review request | **Must apply** — Can this be an async message? |
| Strategy / roadmap planning | **Must apply** — Delete low-impact items first |
| Configuration / deployment issue | **Must apply** — Ask if code change is even needed |
| Single-line typo or obvious fix | **Skip** — Just fix it |
| User gives explicit instructions | **Skip** — Follow instructions, then review |

## The Five Steps

### Step 1: Question the Requirement

Ask: **"Is this actually needed? What happens if we don't do it?"**

- Challenge every request, including your own instincts
- Check if the problem solves itself (e.g., agent self-corrects after retry)
- Distinguish "nice to have" from "actually broken"
- Ask who benefits and how often
- If only one user hit it once, it's probably not a product problem

Decision matrix:

| Frequency | Impact | Action |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Common + High | Do it | Proceed to Step 2 |
| Common + Low | Maybe | Proceed to Step 2 |
| Rare + High | Record | Log for later, don't code now |
| Rare + Low | Skip | Don't do it |

### Step 2: Delete

**Remove what shouldn't exist before adding anything.**

- Delete the feature, code, or process that created the problem
- Delete options when a sensible default works
- Delete fallbacks when the primary path is reliable
- Delete auto-detection when one config line suffices
- Delete backwards-compatibility shims for things nobody uses

Rule: **If you're not sure whether something is needed, delete it.** Adding it back is faster than maintaining unnecessary complexity.

### Step 3: Simplify

**Find the minimum solution that works reliably.**

| Complex (avoid) | Simple (prefer) |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| 30-line auto-detection from headers | One line in `.env` |
| Smart fallback chain A → B → C → D | Single source of truth |
| Middleware + dispatcher + config | One function |
| "Handle both cases" | Pick one, document the other |
| Build a UI for configuration | Tell users to edit a file |
| Add a parameter for flexibility | Choose the right default |

Rule: **One config line beats 30 lines of detection code.** A clear error message beats a graceful fallback.

### Step 4: Accelerate

Only optimize what survived Steps 1-3.

- Don't optimize what shouldn't exist
- Don't speed up a complex solution when a simple one exists
- Measure before optimizing
- Optimize the critical path, not edge cases

### Step 5: Automate

Only automate what has been manually validated.

- Never automate a process you haven't done manually first
- Never automate something that happens once
- Never automate before simplifying
- Automation is the LAST step, never the first

## Analysis Output Format

When analyzing a requirement or feedback:

```
### Step 1: Question
[Is it needed? Who benefits? How often?]

### Step 2: Delete
[What can we remove instead of adding?]

### Step 3: Simplify
[What's the minimum reliable solution?]

### Conclusion
Do / Don't do / Record for later — [one sentence reason]
```

Most analyses end at Step 3. Only proceed to Steps 4-5 for performance-critical or high-frequency operations.

## Feedback Batch Analysis

When receiving multiple feedback points at once:

1. Number each point
2. Run Step 1 on each: Is it our problem? Is it actually broken?
3. Build a verdict table:

```
| # | Point | Verdict | Reason |
|---|-------|---------|--------|
| 1 | ... | Don't do | Agent self-corrects |
| 2 | ... | Do | Confirmed bug, simple fix |
| 3 | ... | Not ours | Client-side config issue |
| 4 | ... | Record | Valid but low priority |
```

4. Only items that survive Step 1 get Steps 2-3
5. Typical result: 5 feedback points → 1-2 actionable items

## Anti-Pattern Detection

Catch yourself when you see these patterns:

| What you're about to do | Ask yourself |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| Add auto-detection / smart defaults | Is one config line really too hard for the user? |
| Add a fallback for edge cases | Does this edge case actually happen? |
| Build it now for future flexibility | Has anyone asked for this? |
| Add a parameter / option / flag | Can I just pick the right default? |
| Fix a data issue with code logic | Should the user fix their data instead? |
| Handle multiple cases in one function | Can I just handle the common case? |
| Add error recovery / retry logic | Does the caller already retry? |
| Write 5 lines "just in case" | Will these 5 lines need maintaining forever? |
| Schedule a recurring meeting | Can this be async or a shared document? |
| Add a review/approval step | Am I reacting to one incident with permanent process? |
| Hire for a new role | Can I simplify the work so it doesn't need a new person? |
| Adopt a new tool or platform | Can I fix how we use the current one? |
| Create a new Slack channel / group | Does this reduce communication or add noise? |
| Write a policy document | Can a one-line rule replace a 10-page policy? |

## Real-World Examples

### "Auto-detect public URL from request headers"
- **Step 1:** Users deploy behind nginx, need correct URLs → Valid need
- **Step 2:** Delete the detection — it has edge cases (MCP transport security, proxy headers)
- **Step 3:** `APP_URL=https://domain` in `.env` → one line, zero edge cases
- **Result:** Don't auto-detect. The "smart" solution caused 3 production incidents.

### "Agent passes merchant name instead of UUID"
- **Step 1:** Agent self-corrects in 2 seconds by calling list_merchants → Works already
- **Result:** Don't do. Record as low-priority ergonomic improvement.

### "Add example outputs to settings page"
- **Step 1:** Settings page is for configuration, not product demos
- **Step 2:** Delete the idea — wrong place for it
- **Result:** Don't do. Settings page stays focused.

### "Script writer doesn't work for recruitment content"
- **Step 1:** Product is designed for marketing scripts, not HR content
- **Result:** Don't do. Not a bug — it's a scope boundary.

### "Force authentication token for public deployment"
- **Step 1:** Self-hosted product, user decides their security posture
- **Result:** Don't do. Design choice, not a deficiency.

### "We need a weekly status meeting for the new project"
- **Step 1:** What decision requires this meeting? Can it be async?
- **Step 2:** Delete the meeting. Replace with a shared doc updated async.
- **Step 3:** If sync is truly needed, make it 15 min biweekly, not 60 min weekly.
- **Result:** Delete or simplify. Most status meetings exist because no one questioned them.

### "Let's hire a dedicated DevOps engineer"
- **Step 1:** What are they going to do daily? Is current CI/CD actually broken?
- **Step 2:** Delete manual deployment steps first — automate with a shell script.
- **Step 3:** If 2 hours/week of deployment work remains, it doesn't justify a full hire.
- **Result:** Simplify the process first. Hire only if workload justifies after simplification.

### "We should switch from Tool A to Tool B"
- **Step 1:** What specific problem does Tool A fail at? Is it the tool or how we use it?
- **Step 2:** Can we fix Tool A's config instead of migrating?
- **Step 3:** If migration is needed, what's the smallest scope that solves the actual problem?
- **Result:** Fix before replacing. Migration cost is almost always underestimated.

### "Add a review/approval step to the publishing workflow"
- **Step 1:** What went wrong that triggered this request? How often?
- **Step 2:** If it was one incident, delete the proposal. Fix the root cause instead.
- **Step 3:** If recurring, add a checklist instead of a human bottleneck.
- **Result:** Don't add process to prevent rare events. Process has compounding cost.

- [ ] This is the simplest approach that works (Step 3)
- [ ] I'm not adding process to fix a one-time incident
- [ ] I'm not building for a hypothetical future
- [ ] I'm not adding a tool/role/meeting when simplifying existing ones works
- [ ] For code: I verified the change compiles/imports before shipping
- [ ] For code: I'll ship → verify → then start the next change
