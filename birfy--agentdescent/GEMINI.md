`agentdescent.agents` is the **general "talk to a model/agent" layer**. It is
deliberately separate from `agentdescent.evolution` — how you reach a model has
nothing to do with skill evolution, and any application built on the framework
can use it.

The whole contract is one type:

```python
Completion = Callable[[str], str]      # prompt -> text
```

Anything that maps a prompt to text is a completion — an LLM call, a tool-using
agent loop, a canned stub. Adapters build completions; higher layers turn a
completion into whatever task interface they need.

*Module:* [`agentdescent.agents`](https://github.com/Birfy/agentdescent/blob/main/agentdescent/agents.py)
· *API:* [`Completion`, `claude`, `openai_compatible`, `cli_agent`, …](api.md#agents-and-models)
· *See also:* [backends](backends.md) for document tasks, and
[runners](directory-evolution.md) for giving an agent the evolving directory.

## Configuring your provider and key

Credentials are read from the **environment at call time** — they never pass
through code, arguments, or a config file the repo owns. Two variables decide
everything:

| variable | used by | value |
|---|---|---|
| `OPENAI_BASE_URL` | `openai_compatible` | the endpoint's root, e.g. `https://api.deepseek.com` |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | `openai_compatible` | your key for that endpoint |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | `claude` | your Anthropic key (or run `ant auth login`) |

**DeepSeek**

```bash
export OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://api.deepseek.com
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
python -m examples.adas.adas_meta_agent_search --provider openai --model deepseek-v4-flash
```

**GLM / Zhipu**

```bash
export OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://open.bigmodel.cn/api/paas/v4
export OPENAI_API_KEY=...
python -m examples.adas.adas_meta_agent_search --provider openai --model glm-4.6
```

**OpenAI** — `OPENAI_BASE_URL` is the default here and may be omitted

```bash
export OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
python -m examples.adas.adas_meta_agent_search --provider openai --model gpt-4.1-mini
```

**A local server** (vLLM, Ollama, LM Studio) — the key is unused but must be set

```bash
export OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000/v1
export OPENAI_API_KEY=not-used
python -m examples.adas.adas_meta_agent_search --provider openai --model my-local-model
```

**Claude** — a different variable, and `ant auth login` works instead

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
python -m examples.adas.adas_meta_agent_search --provider claude --model claude-haiku-4-5
```

Put the `export` lines in your shell profile to keep them across sessions. Every
faithful algorithm port also takes a zero-network `--dry-run`, which prints the
configuration without reading these credentials — the cheapest way to inspect a
run before paying for it:

```bash
python -m examples.adas.adas_meta_agent_search --dry-run
```

!!! tip "Check the endpoint before a long run"
    `--provider openai` talks to whatever `OPENAI_BASE_URL` points at, so a typo
    surfaces as an HTTP error rather than a wrong answer. To see what a key can
    reach:

    ```bash
    curl -s "$OPENAI_BASE_URL/models" -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY"
    ```

    Common replies: `401` — the key is wrong for this base URL; `402` /
    `Insufficient Balance` — the account is out of credit; `404` on
    `/chat/completions` — the base URL is missing or has an extra path segment
    (most gateways want the version prefix, e.g. `/v1`).

## Adapters

```python
from agentdescent import claude, from_callable, echo, with_retries

# Claude (needs: pip install anthropic + credentials / `ant auth login`)
model = claude(model="claude-opus-4-8")           # or claude-haiku-4-5 for cheap runs
text = model("What is 2+2?")

# Any callable you already have
model = from_callable(lambda prompt: my_llm.generate(prompt))

# Deterministic, no-network stub for tests / dry runs
stub = echo(str.upper)          # returns transform(prompt), or the prompt itself

# Wrap any completion with exponential-backoff retries
robust = with_retries(claude(model="claude-haiku-4-5"), attempts=3)
```

`claude()` accepts a `client=` to reuse an existing `anthropic.Anthropic`
instance, and forwards extra kwargs to `messages.create`.

!!! warning "`content: null` is not the same as `""`"
    On OpenAI-compatible endpoints a reasoning model that spends its whole budget
    on `reasoning_content` answers with JSON `null`, not an empty string.
    `openai_compatible` normalises that to `""`, because returning `None` breaks
    the one contract in the package (`Completion` is `prompt -> str`) and used to
    surface as `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'strip'` from inside
    `LLMAgent` — which the engine then **retried as a backend transient**,
    diagnosing a systematic model/parameter mismatch as a flaky endpoint. With the
    empty string the warning above fires instead and names the real cause.

    HTTP errors carry the provider's own message too (`rate limit: retry in 12s`,
    `context length exceeded`), rather than collapsing to `HTTP Error 429`. Extra
    keyword arguments — `temperature=0` and any provider-specific field — go
    straight into the request body, matching `claude()`.

!!! tip "Give a reasoning model room"
    A reasoning model spends its budget on internal reasoning *before* emitting
    visible text, so too small a `max_tokens` yields an **empty completion**, not a
    short answer. Measured on `deepseek-v4-flash` with the standard reflection
    prompt: at `max_tokens=1024`, 4 of 8 replies came back empty; at 3000, none did.

    Both adapters default to **4096**. You are billed for tokens *generated*, not
    for the cap, so a generous limit costs nothing — and an empty reflection emits
    a `RuntimeWarning` naming this as the likely cause.

    **4096 is not always enough.** That figure was measured on a short reflection
    prompt; the budget a model needs scales with how much it has to think about.
    On ADAS's meta-agent prompt — a whole archive of designs and their fitness —
    `deepseek-v4-flash` at 4096 returned empty content on **every** call, burning
    the full budget on reasoning each time; at 16384 it answered every time, with
    a reply of only ~250 tokens. If a caller's prompts are long or its task is
    hard, raise the cap and check: an empty completion scores as a wrong answer,
    it does not raise.

## What did the run cost? — `Usage`

A `Completion` is `prompt -> text`, so the token counts the providers *do* return
would be thrown away at the adapter boundary. Pass a `Usage` and they are kept:

```python
from agentdescent import Usage, openai_compatible, metered

usage = Usage()
model = openai_compatible(model="deepseek-v4-flash", usage=usage)   # or claude(usage=usage)

evolve(tasks, reward, agent=LLMAgent(model), rounds=10)

print(usage.summary())          # 412 calls, 1,204,881 prompt + 96,004 completion tokens, 903.2s in the model
print(usage.estimated_cost(per_1m_prompt=0.28, per_1m_completion=0.42))
```

| | |
|---|---|
| `calls`, `failures` | attempts made, and how many raised (retries count individually — they cost money) |
| `prompt_tokens`, `completion_tokens`, `total_tokens` | **real** counts from the API response |
| `seconds` | wall-clock spent inside the model |
| `estimated_cost(...)` | you supply the per-million prices; the library ships no price table it would have to keep current |

`Usage` is safe to share across worker threads. For a backend that is not one of
the built-in providers — a tool-using agent loop, say — wrap it in
`metered(completion, usage)`, which counts calls, failures and time (tokens are
not observable through a plain `Completion`).

## Bringing another provider

There is no provider lock-in — any `prompt -> text` function is a completion:

```python
def openai_completion(prompt: str) -> str:
    resp = openai_client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-...", messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}])
    return resp.choices[0].message.content

from agentdescent import from_callable
model = from_callable(openai_completion)
```

## Using it in skill evolution

`agentdescent.evolution` consumes a completion through `LLMAgent`:

```python
from agentdescent import claude
from agentdescent import LLMAgent

agent = LLMAgent(claude(model="claude-haiku-4-5"))
```

`claude_agent(model=...)` in the evolution engine is just a convenience for
`LLMAgent(claude(model))` — the provider code lives here, in `agentdescent.agents`.

## Tool-using agents — the same contract

An agent that *acts* (Claude Code, Codex, OpenHands, aider, …) differs from an API
model in that it runs commands and edits files before answering. Its **call
contract is identical**: text in, text out. So they are all `Completion`s, and
everything that takes a completion takes all of them with no special-casing:

```python
from agentdescent import claude, openai_compatible, claude_code, codex, cli_agent
from agentdescent.backends import openhands

claude(model="claude-haiku-4-5")                    # API model
openai_compatible(model="deepseek-v4-flash")        # any OpenAI-compatible endpoint
claude_code()                                        # Claude Code, print mode
codex()                                              # Codex CLI
openhands(model="openai/deepseek-v4-flash")          # OpenHands SDK
cli_agent(["my-agent", "--json"])                    # anything with a CLI
```

| Factory | What it runs | Needs |
|---|---|---|
| `claude(...)` / `openai_compatible(...)` | one model call | `anthropic` / nothing |
| **`cli_agent(command, ...)`** | **any command-line agent** — prompt on argv or stdin, stdout is the answer | that CLI on `PATH` |
| `claude_code()` / `codex()` | thin presets over `cli_agent` | `claude` / `codex` CLI |
| `openhands(...)` | a real OpenHands agent (terminal + file_editor) | `openhands-ai`, Python ≥ 3.12 |

Failures raise **`AgentError`** carrying the agent's own stderr, not a bare exit
code, and every CLI agent takes a `timeout` — an agent that hangs would otherwise
stall the round it belongs to (see [`round_timeout`](evolution.md#every-knob-is-a-module)).

### Giving an agent somewhere to work — `WorkspaceAgent`

`Completion` stays `prompt -> text` for everything. An acting agent often needs a
*place* to act, and a caller that stages files needs to say where, so tool-using
agents add exactly one optional capability:

```python
agent = claude_code()
agent.in_workspace("/tmp/task-17")("summarise report.txt")   # runs with that cwd
```

Feature-detect it rather than assuming — plain API models deliberately do not
implement it:

```python
from agentdescent import WorkspaceAgent

if isinstance(agent, WorkspaceAgent):
    answer = agent.in_workspace(staged_dir)(prompt)   # it can grep real files
else:
    answer = agent(prompt_with_material_inlined)      # fall back to the prompt
```

### Domain adapters and the OpenHands backend — see the backends page

Document-shaped tasks (`answer(question, document, skills)`) and the OpenHands
container backend have their own layer and their own page:
[backends](backends.md) is canonical for `document_agent`, `openhands`, and
`tool_loop_backend`, including the OfficeQA inline-fallback warning. Nothing
about them changes the completion contract on this page.
