# GitHub Copilot Instructions for RustIRC

> **Purpose**: This file provides context and guidelines for GitHub Copilot when working on this repository. It helps Copilot understand project conventions, standards, and best practices that cannot be inferred from code alone.

## Project Overview

RustIRC is a modern IRC client built in Rust that combines the best features from established IRC clients (mIRC, HexChat, WeeChat). The project prioritizes full IRC protocol compliance (RFC 1459/2812, IRCv3), cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux), and provides multiple interface modes (GUI with Iced 0.13.1, TUI with ratatui, CLI).

**Current Version**: v0.3.8 - Enhanced Iced Material Design GUI  
**Status**: Production-ready with 100% functional Material Design 3 implementation

## Technology Stack

- **Language**: Rust (MSRV: 1.89+)
- **Async Runtime**: Tokio for network I/O
- **GUI Framework**: Iced 0.13.1 with Material Design 3 components
- **TUI Framework**: ratatui for terminal interface
- **Security**: rustls for TLS, complete SASL authentication (PLAIN, EXTERNAL, SCRAM-SHA-256)
- **Scripting**: mlua for Lua integration
- **Architecture**: Event-driven with modular 6-crate workspace structure

## Essential Commands

### Building and Running
```bash
# Build the project
cargo build
cargo build --release

# Run in different modes
cargo run                    # GUI mode (default)
cargo run -- --cli          # CLI prototype mode
cargo run -- --tui          # TUI mode with ratatui
cargo run -- --config path/to/config.toml  # Custom config

# Run tests
cargo test
cargo test -- --nocapture  # Show println! output
```

### Code Quality
```bash
# Format code (required before commits)
cargo fmt

# Lint code (must pass before commits)
cargo clippy -- -D warnings

# Pre-commit check
cargo fmt --check && cargo clippy -- -D warnings

# Generate documentation
cargo doc --open
```

## Coding Standards

### Critical Rules
1. **Zero Placeholder Code**: Never leave "TODO" or "In a real implementation" comments. Implement all functionality completely.
2. **No Removal Strategy**: Fix compilation errors by implementing missing functionality, never by removing/disabling features.
3. **Complete Platform Support**: Implement full Windows (PowerShell), macOS (osascript), Linux (notify-send) support using conditional compilation.
4. **Error Handling**: Always use proper Result types with descriptive error messages. Follow Rust error handling idioms.
5. **Memory Safety**: Leverage Rust's ownership model. Use references appropriately, avoid unnecessary clones unless required for lifetime management.

### Rust Best Practices
- Follow Rust naming conventions (snake_case for functions/variables, CamelCase for types)
- Use `async/await` with Tokio for all network operations
- Implement proper trait bounds and lifetime annotations
- Disable pagers in git commands: `git --no-pager`
- Use `#[cfg(target_os = "...")]` for platform-specific code

### IRC Protocol Specifics
- **Field Naming**: Verify against protocol definitions (e.g., WHOIS uses `targets` not `target`)
- **Message Filtering**: Handle case-sensitive filtering (both "System" and "system")
- **Command Implementation**: Use `rustirc_protocol::Command` for IRC method implementation
- **Protocol Compliance**: Full support for RFC 1459/2812 and IRCv3 extensions

### GUI Development (Iced 0.13.1)
- Use proper border syntax with `0.0.into()` for radius
- Apply container styling for pane dividers
- Implement Material Design 3 patterns with SerializableColor wrapper
- Use `.into()` conversions for automatic color type conversions
- Handle lifetime issues with clone-before-move pattern

## Common Patterns

### Compilation Error Resolution
1. **Type Mismatches**: Convert types properly using Into/From traits
2. **Lifetime Issues**: Use clone-before-move pattern: `let value = data.clone(); move || { use value }`
3. **Borrow Checker**: Extract values before closures to satisfy borrow checker
4. **Platform Code**: Use conditional compilation with complete implementations

### Multi-Server Architecture
- Use `HashMap<String, ServerData>` for server management
- Check server-specific connection state before IRC operations
- Implement proper command routing with server validation
- Provide informative error messages for unavailable servers

### Material Design 3 Integration
- SerializableColor wrapper for config persistence: `[f32; 4]` with serde traits
- Implement `.scale_alpha()` for transparency adjustments
- Use `.build()` APIs for MaterialText/MaterialButton components
- Apply responsive layouts with proper enum traits

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for protocol commands
- Integration tests for connection scenarios
- Mock IRC servers for edge cases
- UI tests using framework-specific tools
- Performance benchmarks for message throughput
- Security audits for input validation

## GitHub Actions / CI/CD
- BASH_ENV helper functions required for cross-platform timeout support
- sccache HTTP 400 fallback to local disk cache
- Timeout protection for all cargo operations
- Clippy must run AFTER successful build completion
- All platforms must pass: Windows, Linux (x64/ARM64), macOS (x64/ARM64)

## Security Considerations
- All network communication over TLS by default
- Secure credential storage (system keychain integration)
- Sandboxed scripting environment
- Input validation against malformed IRC messages
- DCC security warnings and IP masking options

## Documentation Requirements
- Maintain rustdoc comments for all public APIs
- Include examples in documentation
- Update CHANGELOG.md for all user-facing changes
- Keep README.md badges and status up to date
- Document all architectural decisions

## Performance Goals
- Handle 100+ simultaneous channels without lag
- Efficient user list management with optimized data structures
- Background logging and message processing
- Responsive UI even under heavy message load
- 60 FPS animations in GUI mode

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid
❌ Running clippy before or parallel to build  
❌ Using restore-keys parameter with Swatinem/rust-cache@v2  
❌ Leaving placeholder/stub code  
❌ Removing features to fix compilation errors  
❌ Using matrix.os in shell expressions with workflow_call  
❌ Missing platform-specific implementations  

✅ Implement complete functionality immediately  
✅ Run clippy after successful build  
✅ Use proper error types and handling  
✅ Complete platform support with #[cfg]  
✅ Follow established patterns in codebase  
✅ Update documentation with code changes  

## Getting Help
- Review existing code patterns in the codebase
- Check `docs/` for architectural guidance
- Refer to `ref_docs/` for development plans
- Review `to-dos/` for phase-specific requirements
- Consult IRC protocol specs in `docs/specs/`

When in doubt, prioritize:
1. Memory safety and Rust idioms
2. Complete implementation over partial solutions
3. Cross-platform compatibility
4. Protocol compliance
5. Code quality and documentation

## Working with Issues and Pull Requests

### Issue Assignment Guidelines
- When assigned an issue, read it completely along with all comments
- Check for related issues or PRs that provide additional context
- Ask clarifying questions if the requirements are ambiguous
- Break down large tasks into smaller, manageable steps
- Report progress regularly using commit messages and PR updates

### Pull Request Guidelines
- Create focused PRs that address a single issue or feature
- Write clear commit messages following Conventional Commits format
- Include tests for new functionality or bug fixes
- Update documentation to reflect code changes
- Request review when ready, highlighting areas needing particular attention
- Respond to review feedback promptly and professionally

### When to Ask for Clarification
- Requirements are unclear or contradictory
- You encounter architectural decisions that affect multiple components
- You need access to external resources or credentials
- You discover security vulnerabilities that need immediate attention
- You find that the requested change would break existing functionality

## Boundaries and Constraints

### What NOT to Do
- **Never** commit secrets, credentials, or sensitive data to the repository
- **Never** remove or disable tests to make builds pass
- **Never** introduce known security vulnerabilities
- **Never** make breaking changes without explicit approval
- **Never** modify `.github/workflows/` files without thorough testing
- **Never** add dependencies without checking for security advisories
- **Never** disable clippy warnings without addressing the underlying issue

### Safe Operations
- Add new features in isolated modules
- Fix bugs with accompanying regression tests
- Refactor code while maintaining existing tests
- Update documentation and examples
- Add missing error handling
- Improve type safety
- Optimize performance with benchmarks
