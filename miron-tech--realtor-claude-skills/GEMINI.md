              Lead Recon (research + speed response)
                    ↓
              Nurture Coach (follow-up until they convert)

```

## Weekly Content Engine

```
Market Intel → generates weekly content package
    ├── Social posts (Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, LinkedIn, Nextdoor, GBP)
    ├── Email newsletter segment
    └── Market report (client-ready)

Neighborhood Dominator → generates long-term positioning
    ├── Area guide (lead magnet PDF)
    ├── SEO content pages
    ├── 12-month content calendar
    └── Google Business Profile strategy
```

## Context Matrix
Skills receive ONLY the data they need from prior skills. See `start-here-SKILL.md` for the full matrix. Key rule: selective context produces better output than dumping everything.

## Client Memory
All client data persists in `./clients/`. See `_system/client-memory.md` for the full protocol:
- Per-client folders with recon, sequences, comps, assets
- Market profile cache by ZIP (reusable across clients)
- Pipeline registry (buyer leads, seller leads, active listings)
- Sphere of influence tracking
- Content calendar
- Learnings journal (calibrates lead scoring over time)

## Time Savings

| Task | Before | After | Time Back |
|------|--------|-------|-----------|
| Research a lead + respond | 15-20 min | 60 seconds | ~18 min |
| New listing marketing (all assets) | 2-3 hours | 10 min | ~2.5 hours |
| Follow-up sequence (7 touches) | 30-45 min | 3 min | ~35 min |
| Comp analysis + pricing strategy | 45-60 min | 5 min | ~50 min |
| Listing presentation | 2-3 hours | 10 min | ~2.5 hours |
| Weekly market content | 3-4 hours | 15 min | ~3.5 hours |
| Expired/FSBO prospecting (per property) | 20-30 min | 2 min | ~25 min |
| Sphere touches (monthly) | 2-3 hours | 10 min | ~2.5 hours |
| Post-close review + referral | 20-30 min | 3 min | ~25 min |
| Investment analysis | 30-45 min | 5 min | ~35 min |
| Open house campaign (full cycle) | 2-3 hours | 15 min | ~2.5 hours |

**At 10 leads/week, 2 listings/month, and 2 closings/month: 8-12 hours back every week.**
