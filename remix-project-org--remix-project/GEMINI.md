### Key Libraries to Know

**remix-ai-core** (Important for AI features):
- Location: `libs/remix-ai-core/src/`
- Structure:
  - `agents/`: Code explanation, security, completion, workspace agents
  - `remix-mcp-server/`: MCP (Model Context Protocol) server implementation
    - `handlers/`: Tool handlers (compilation, debugging, deployment, file management)
    - `providers/`: Resource providers (compilation, project, deployment, tutorials)
    - `middleware/`: Security, validation
  - `inferencers/`: Local (Ollama) and remote AI model integration
  - `prompts/`: System prompts and prompt builders

**remix-core-plugin**:
- Base classes for plugin development
- Plugin architecture based on `@remixproject/engine`
- Event-driven communication

**remix-ui**:
- Modular React components in separate packages
- Each concern has its own sub-package (e.g., `remix-ui/terminal`, `remix-ui/editor`)
- Uses Bootstrap 5 and React hooks

**remix-ide-e2e**:
- Nightwatch-based E2E tests
- Tests organized by feature with groups: `<testname>_group<number>.test.js`
- Group tags allow parallel execution: `#group1`, `#group2`, etc.
- Special requirements:
  - `ballot` tests need Ganache running locally
  - `remixd` tests need remixd daemon running
  - `gist` tests need GitHub token in `.env`

## Development Commands

```bash
# Initial setup
yarn install
yarn run build:libs    # Always build libs first
yarn build             # Build entire project
yarn serve             # Dev server (http://127.0.0.1:8080)
yarn serve:hot         # With hot module reload

# Library-specific
nx build <library-name>
nx test <library-name>
nx lint <library-name>

# E2E testing
yarn build:e2e                                    # Build tests first
yarn test:e2e --test=<testname> --group=group1   # Run specific group
yarn test:e2e --test=<testname>                  # Run all groups
yarn run select_test                             # Interactive selector

# Production
yarn run build:production
yarn run serve:production

# Utilities
nx dep-graph          # View dependency graph
yarn format           # Format code
```

## Important Patterns & Conventions

### File Organization
- TypeScript path aliases defined in `tsconfig.base.json`
- Use `@remix-project/<library-name>` imports, not relative paths across libraries
- Each library has: `src/`, `README.md`, `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`

### Testing Patterns
- Unit tests: Jest, located alongside source files
- E2E tests: Nightwatch, in `apps/remix-ide-e2e/src/tests/`
- Group tags in E2E: `'Test description #group1': function (browser) { ... }`
- Must add `'@disabled': true` to test file metadata when using groups

### Plugin Architecture
- Plugins extend base classes from `remix-core-plugin`
- Communication via event system
- API contracts defined in `remix-api`
- Uses `@remixproject/engine` framework

### UI Component Pattern
```typescript
import React from 'react'

interface ComponentProps {
  // props
}

export const Component: React.FC<ComponentProps> = (props) => {
  // React hooks for state
  // Bootstrap 5 for styling
  return <div>...</div>
}
```

### Internationalization
- Uses react-intl with FormattedMessage
- Translations managed via CrowdIn (NOT GitHub PRs)
- Locale files in `apps/remix-ide/src/app/tabs/locales/`
- Always provide `id` prop, `defaultMessage` only for dynamic IDs

## When Working on This Codebase

### Always Check First
1. **Build libs before building apps**: `yarn run build:libs` before `yarn build`
2. **Nx cache**: Uses Nx Cloud for caching (configured in `nx.json`)
3. **Node version**: Requires Node 20+ (check `package.json` engines)
4. **Branch strategy**: PRs should target `master` branch

### Common Locations
- **Tests**: `apps/remix-ide-e2e/src/tests/` (E2E), `<library>/src/**/*.spec.ts` (unit)
- **UI Components**: `libs/remix-ui/<component>/src/lib/`
- **Plugin Code**: `libs/remix-core-plugin/src/`
- **AI Features**: `libs/remix-ai-core/src/`
- **Documentation**: `README.md` in each library/app
- **Contributing Guide**: `CONTRIBUTING.md` at root

### File Reading Strategy
When exploring the codebase:
1. Start with `README.md` files in relevant directories
2. Check `package.json` for dependencies and scripts
3. Look for TypeScript interfaces/types to understand data structures
4. Read tests to understand expected behavior
5. For AI features, check `libs/remix-ai-core/src/` structure

### Code Style
- Follow JavaScript Standard Style
- TypeScript preferred for new code
- Run `yarn format` before committing
- Avoid over-engineering: keep changes focused and minimal

### Typical Task Workflows

**Adding a new library:**
```bash
nx generate @nrwl/node:library <name>
# Update build:libs script in package.json
# Add README.md
```

**Adding UI component:**
- Create in `libs/remix-ui/<component>/src/lib/`
- Export from package index
- Add tests alongside component
- Use existing Bootstrap 5 classes

**Adding E2E test:**
- Create in `apps/remix-ide-e2e/src/tests/`
- Use group tags: `#group1`, `#group2`, etc.
- Add `'@disabled': true` to metadata
- Build with `yarn build:e2e` before running

**Adding AI features:**
- Agents: `libs/remix-ai-core/src/agents/`
- MCP Handlers: `libs/remix-ai-core/src/remix-mcp-server/handlers/`
- Resource Providers: `libs/remix-ai-core/src/remix-mcp-server/providers/`
- Prompts: `libs/remix-ai-core/src/prompts/`

## Environment Variables

- `NX_CLOUD_ACCESS_TOKEN`: Nx Cloud authentication (read from env)
- `NX_ENDPOINTS_URL`: API endpoints (used in serve:endpoints, serve:ngrok)
- `NX_DESKTOP_FROM_DIST`: Desktop build configuration flag
- `WALLET_CONNECT_PROJECT_ID`: WalletConnect integration

## Known Issues & Quirks

1. **Memory issues**: May need to increase Node memory for builds
   - `node --max-old-space-size=8192` is used in some scripts

2. **Nx cache**: Sometimes needs clearing with `--skip-nx-cache` flag

3. **E2E tests**:
   - Must build with `yarn build:e2e` after any test file changes
   - Script at `apps/remix-ide-e2e/src/buildGroupTests.js` processes group tags
   - Some tests require external services (Ganache, remixd)

4. **Hot reload**: Use `yarn serve:hot` for frontend changes, not just `yarn serve`

5. **Import resolution**: Complex import resolver with support for npm, GitHub, IPFS, Swarm
   - See `apps/remix-ide-e2e/README.md` for 14 test groups covering different scenarios

6. **Plugin engine**: Uses custom plugin engine from `@remixproject/engine` package

## Project-Specific Knowledge

### Ethereum/Solidity Context
- This is a Solidity IDE, so many libraries deal with:
  - Solidity compilation and AST parsing
  - EVM debugging and transaction tracing
  - Static analysis for security vulnerabilities
  - Smart contract testing and deployment

### Desktop vs Web IDE
- `remix-ide`: Web application (main focus)
- `remixdesktop`: Electron wrapper with additional local file access
- Both share most code but have different build configurations

### Plugin System
- Remix is highly extensible through plugins
- Plugins can be loaded from URLs, local files, or built-in
- Communication via pub/sub event system
- Each plugin has a profile (name, description, methods, events)

### Testing Philosophy
- Group-based E2E tests for parallel execution
- Tests can run in isolation or all groups sequentially
- CircleCI runs tests in parallel across multiple containers
- Can tag tests with `#flaky` to run across all instances
