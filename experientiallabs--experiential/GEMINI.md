# Agent guide — experiential

Experiential builds immutable task evidence from agent traces, composes and fits frozen model routers,
runs those routers on loopback, and executes bounded SFT from persisted datasets. All importable
code lives under `exp/`; benchmark data arrives as a dependency (see rule 6).

## Toolchain

Managed with `uv`; lint/format with `ruff`; type-check with `ty`.

```bash
uv sync --extra dev
uv run ruff check .
uv run ruff format --check .
uv run ty check
uv run pytest -q
```

## Repository checks

- Every new or rewritten hand-authored source, configuration, and documentation file with a
  covered suffix stays below 1,000 physical lines. The executable limit is 999 lines and counts
  comments and blank lines. Test modules named `*_test.py` are exempt so cohesive tests are not
  split solely to satisfy a line count. Generated lock files are excluded. Generated code belongs
  in an explicitly named `generated/` directory and is never edited by hand.
- Full-repository Ruff check, Ruff format check, and ty check are required on every change. No
  pre-existing lint or type failures are grandfathered.
- Production imports follow the approved dependency direction: common may not import runtime,
  simulation, optimize, or cli; runtime may not import simulation, optimize, or cli; simulation
  may not import optimize or cli; optimize may not import cli. Optimize owns application
  orchestration and may depend inward on common, runtime, and simulation. The AST gate rejects
  every current forbidden edge directly and proves that the package graph is acyclic.
- The root CLI command set is exact: `build`, `config`, `optimize`, and `run`;
  `exp/cli/app_test.py` and the release tests enforce the current command and distribution shape.

## CLI package ownership

- `exp/cli/app.py` owns root command composition only. Command implementations live in the
  `build/`, `config/`, `judge/`, `optimize/`, `run/`, and `gateway/` packages.
- `exp/cli/providers/` owns provider discovery, model selection, and catalog setup shared by
  commands. Command-specific orchestration stays with its command package. In particular,
  router-candidate collection belongs to `exp/cli/optimize/`.
- `exp/cli/shared/` owns reusable terminal, Typer, consent, picker, and progress primitives. It
  must not import command packages. `exp/cli/providers/` may import `shared/`, but it must not
  import command packages.
- Keep the `exp/cli/` root closed to new command implementation modules. Package-wide CLI tests
  may live in `exp/cli/tests/`; module tests stay beside the module they cover.

## Evidence, simulation, and routing lifecycle

- `exp/simulation/` owns trace ingestion, representative-task mining, typed simulation specs,
  current engines, orchestration, artifact construction, and comparisons. New modules for those
  responsibilities go inside `exp/simulation/`, never at the flat `exp/` root.
- `exp build PROJECT --traces TRACE_FILE --source SOURCE --root ROOT` is the only CLI path
  from local traces to immutable task evidence. It accepts 100 through 1000 normalized traces,
  writes manifest-bound fit and held-out tasks plus `proposals_pending` review state, builds both
  RAG indexes under a strict embedding-cost ceiling, and binds the grounded world model without a
  completion or judge call. Route each corpus through an explicit canonical source loader.
- New trace sources belong in `exp/simulation/ingest/`, normalize into the `Trace` and `TraceSpan`
  contracts in `exp/common/traces/`, support file ingestion, and register from
  `exp/simulation/ingest/__init__.py`.
- Python applications use `exp.compose_router` to complete review, plan-bound simulation,
  judgment, fitting, held-out verification, reporting, and runtime loading. Callers inject the
  approved review and setup suppliers, simulator factory, judge, runtime catalog, and finite
  simulation-dollar and judgment-call ceilings. Preserve its phase boundary: held-out evidence
  opens only after fit evidence, policy locking, and remaining-budget checks pass. Router fitting
  never runs or consumes world-model fidelity evaluation.
- `exp optimize router PROJECT --root ROOT` discovers the completed build, fit-only RAG, grounded
  world model, judge syllabus and provenance, and confirmed router candidates from the project.
  Human calibration is recommended but optional. The command freezes one shared provider ceiling
  before calls, simulates and judges missing fit evidence, locks the fit policy before held-out
  execution, and exactly replays completed work.
  World-model fidelity testing is a separately invoked common-evaluation mode with no authority
  over router fitting or runtime activation. Its reports contain measurements only and never carry
  an approval, denial, gate, threshold, or decision.
- `exp run` starts the initialized authenticated multi-alias gateway on loopback.
  `exp run PROJECT --root ROOT --port PORT [--ghost]` retains the single-project compatibility
  server. Both expose OpenAI Chat Completions, Responses, and Models routes. Public request and
  response types come
  from the official OpenAI SDK. Chat retries use the standard `Idempotency-Key`; Responses
  continuations use `previous_response_id`. Experiential never joins unrelated Chat callers by transcript
  prefix and requires no proprietary request fields or headers. Durable journaling is the default;
  ghost mode performs routed calls without saving traffic or replay state. Request-time embedding
  failure uses the frozen conservative baseline, and neither path mutates policy or evidence.

## Worker-agent execution

- Agent execution code lives under `exp/runtime/`: whole-episode customer agents, executable
  environments, model clients, and frozen router execution. Optimization may depend on runtime;
  runtime code must not depend on simulation or optimization algorithms.
- No-argument `exp run` serves only explicit active gateway aliases. The legacy project form serves
  one frozen router policy. Simulation callers choose an `AgentRuntime` and `EnvironmentRuntime`
  directly, in process.
- Local Pi and process-environment adapters execute external code on the user's machine only when
  a caller explicitly selects them. Preserve bounded processes, the explicit working directory,
  and fail-closed support checks.
- Customer agents implement the whole-episode `AgentRuntime` contract and receive only an injected
  candidate model plus an execute-only `EnvironmentSession`. The built-in Pi adapter invokes an
  externally installed executable.
- Executable environments implement the lifecycle-owning `EnvironmentRuntime` contract. Local and
  injected remote backends preserve exact resource identity, bounded execution, usage metering,
  and fail-closed cleanup evidence. A remote adapter declares and implements its own finite close
  primitive before use, and all of its cleanup runs inside that primitive. The sandbox ledger
  releases an exact ID only after the adapter positively proves cleanup.

## Optimization surfaces

- Customer agent execution lives only in `exp/runtime/agents/`, executable environments live only
  in `exp/runtime/environments/`, and sandbox simulation lives only in
  `exp/simulation/engines/sandbox.py`. Agent-search and benchmark-scoring work belongs to the
  private `agent-optimization` repo; send it there.
- `exp/optimize/router/` owns provider-free offline fit, policy locking, held-out reporting,
  application composition, and their immutable artifacts. Online selection and provider execution
  belong to `exp/runtime/router/`. Keep those two boundaries explicit.
- Router application entrypoints stay in `composition.py` and `activation.py`. Automatic evidence
  orchestration lives in `automatic/`, manual judge calibration in `judging/`, offline policy work
  in `fit/`, and evaluation preparation in `evaluation/`. The durable judgment ledger remains at
  `judgment_budget.py`.
- The root CLI is locked to `build`, `optimize`, `run`, and `config`. The optimize group is locked
  to `router` and `model`; the config group is locked to `budget`, `gateway`, `judge`, `providers`,
  and `telemetry`. Widening any of those three sets, whether with a command, an alias, or a flag, is a
  deliberate change to the locked surface and needs the same scrutiny as a public API change.
- Every paid CLI command uses `exp.cli.shared.consent.require_spend_consent` after a credential-free
  conservative estimate and before credential or provider-client construction. The setting in
  `.exp/settings.toml` is a hard per-command ceiling. Estimates at or below half run automatically,
  higher in-budget estimates need explicit confirmation, and `--yes` never overrides the ceiling.
- Long-lived gateway serving is exempt from one-shot spend consent. Startup performs no provider
  call; every later request requires key-derived authority and content-free attempt accounting.
- `exp optimize model PROJECT` runs only a project-bound immutable W12 to W13 SFT configuration.
  It never builds a dataset, creates teacher rollouts, changes routing roles, or launches a
  simulator. The config freezes the W12 manifest, native Tinker base-model snapshot, capability
  digest, and credential-reference digest without persisting any secret. A finite cap requires a
  conservative estimate for every exact scheduled batch before shared cost authorization;
  `--yes` confirms only an in-budget estimate after those checks. Completed W13 artifacts are
  recursively verified before an opaque sampling handle is atomically registered in `models.toml`.
- Changes to this composition seam require focused persisted-dataset, resume, budget, immutable
  pointer, drift, and catalog-provenance coverage. The seam composes a persisted dataset into an
  SFT run and stops there; training-objective, promotion, and route-registration concerns belong to
  their own owners.

## Python

- Every Python file must have a module docstring.
- Every class, function, and method uses a Google-style docstring, including private helpers,
  nested functions, and test helpers, so each callable states its contract locally. An absolutely
  trivial callable may use one clear summary line.
- **Never `print`.** All diagnostic/progress output goes through a module logger
  (`logging.getLogger(__name__)`), never the `print` builtin — enforced by ruff's `T20` rules.
  The one exception is deliberate user-facing CLI presentation, which goes through a local rich
  `Console` owned by the command module (that is product output, not logging).

## Writing

- Do not modify `README.md` without explicit user approval for that file. A request to implement,
  document, publish, or open a PR does not imply approval to change the README; ask first.
- No em dashes in any NEW writing: code, comments, docstrings, docs, UI copy, commit messages, or
  PR descriptions. Use a comma, a colon, parentheses, a period, or a plain hyphen instead, or
  restructure the sentence. The rule applies to a diff's added lines and is checked in review
  (the /ready-for-merge audit); pre-existing occurrences (including in this file) are
  grandfathered and cleaned opportunistically when a line is edited anyway, not in bulk sweeps.
  Verbatim data quoted inside code fences keeps its original punctuation.
- Production code and docstrings must describe the current behavior, contract, and rationale as a
  self-contained system. Do not reference commit SHAs, deleted implementations, refactor history,
  prior architecture, or the process used to build the code unless required to explain an active
  backward-compatibility constraint. Historical provenance and migration narratives belong in
  design documents, pull requests, or changelogs, not in the implementation.

## Rules

1. **Run project gates before every commit.** Run `uv run ruff check .` and `uv run ty check` over
   the whole project. A change must not introduce new lint or type errors. If the branch already
   has unrelated failures, record them and keep them out of the patch; fix them only when they are
   in scope or prevent meaningful validation.

2. **Tests live inline, one test file per module.** `exp/optimize/router/composition.py` is tested by
   `exp/optimize/router/composition_test.py`, next to it. Pytest is configured (`python_files =
   ["*_test.py"]`) to find these, and there is no top-level `tests/` directory.

   - Give every module a `_test.py` beside it.
   - Leaving that file empty is fine, and better than a vacuous test.
   - Do not create a `_test.py` whose module does not exist. A test that covers a whole package
     goes in that package's own `tests/` directory, such as `exp/simulation/tests/`.

3. **Avoid generic types.** Do not use `Any`, bare `dict`/`object`, or untyped `**kwargs` where a
   concrete type is practical. Prefer explicit pydantic models and fields; for genuinely arbitrary
   JSON use `exp.common.core.artifacts.JsonObject`, not `Any`.

4. **Keep the structure coherent and the command surface intentional.** Agent execution is nested
   under `exp/runtime/`; evidence construction and simulation are nested under `exp/simulation/`;
   router fitting, application orchestration, and SFT are nested under `exp/optimize/`; shared
   contracts, model metadata, minimal configuration, and product telemetry are under `exp/common/`.
   Provider execution belongs under `exp/runtime/models/providers/`. Common, runtime, and simulation
   must not import optimize. Keep the locked CLI small and do not return production modules to the
   flat `exp/` namespace.
   Provider-neutral gateway request, stream-event, target, and persistence interfaces live under
   `exp/runtime/gateway/`. `lifecycle.py` composes them only for the explicit local launch. Exact
   deployment metadata and singleton catalog normalization live under `exp/common/models/`.
   Gateway-only protocol and integer-pricing fields must not be added to `ModelCapabilities`:
   its existing identity digest remains frozen for router artifact compatibility.

5. **The top level is a closed allowlist.** The tracked top-level directories are exactly: `exp/`,
   `docs/`, `assets/`, `.claude/`, `.github/`. That list is closed.

   `.agents/` is the one sanctioned scratchpad: a local, gitignored working directory for agent
   sessions (notes, probe scripts, run outputs). It is never tracked, never part of a PR, and
   nothing under `exp/` or `docs/` may reference a path inside it. Anything in a scratchpad worth
   keeping gets promoted into a real surface or an external repo before the work merges.

   **Agents must never create a new top-level directory.** Not for scratch work, not for a
   one-off script, not for output, not "temporarily". If work does not fit an existing surface,
   put it under the closest one and say so - do not invent a sibling. The only way a new
   top-level directory is ever added is that a human names the exact directory and grants
   permission for that name; then, in the same change, it is added to `ALLOWED_TOP_DIRS` in
   `exp/tests/repo_layout_test.py` and documented here. Blanket approval to "restructure" or "add whatever
   you need" is not permission for a directory name. Absent that, an agent that wants a new surface
   asks and waits. The same rule binds top-level FILES, against `ALLOWED_TOP_FILES` in the same
   test. Both lists are enforced by the gate, so an unapproved path fails CI rather than landing
   quietly. What each surface is for:
   - `docs/`: **reviewed public documentation** in `docs/research/` (completed research writeups
     and their rendered figures under `docs/research/figures/`), `docs/reference/` (how-to
     references verified against main), and `docs/cookbook/` (end-to-end walks through the whole
     pipeline on one benchmark, each step one real CLI command plus the artifact it creates),
     plus two root pages: `docs/usage.md` (the terse map of the CLI surface: one line of purpose
     and one artifact per command) and `docs/release-scope.md` (the supported and explicitly
     excluded claims of the current release, checked by `exp/tests/release_test.py`). Nothing else: raw
     result JSONs, vector sources, design notes, and drafts stay out of the repo. `docs/README.md`
     indexes every doc and records its purpose. Update or remove superseded material only after
     checking references and retaining durable evidence.
     Reproduction lives in the report itself, quoted as public `exp` API/CLI plus the exact
     parameter pins.
     Everything generated stays out of git: project evidence and model artifacts under the local
     `.exp/` root, distribution archives under ignored `dist/`, and external benchmark inputs.
     Never commit local settings files (`settings.toml` anywhere).
   - `assets/` contains the small, reviewed visual assets referenced by the README and public docs.
   - `exp/` is the flagship package and the only importable code. Domain subpackages own their
     area under the rule 4 hierarchy. Provider-neutral model contracts live under
     `exp/common/models/`, and explicit HTTP-backed clients live under
     `exp/runtime/models/providers/`.
   - `.claude/` — checked-in agent skills (e.g. `/ready-for-merge`); local files
     (`settings.local.json`, locks) stay gitignored.
   - `.github/` — CI workflows.

   Scratch work has no home in this repo. One-off scripts, experiment runners, scratchpads, and
   drafts go outside the checkout (`/tmp`, a personal directory, or the Notion experiments area
   under Research). When such work matures, promote its durable output into a real surface:
   writeup → `docs/research/`, verified how-to → `docs/reference/`, reusable code → `exp/`.

6. **Benchmark data is external input, not a repository directory.** Give `exp build` one explicit
   local OTLP or PostHog export, then use only the locked `config`, `optimize`, and `run` surfaces
   for persisted project artifacts. Do not vendor benchmark data, gold dirs, or capture scripts.

7. **Give reusable workflows a clear owner.** A workflow has exactly one home, inside `exp/`.
   If a workflow is generally useful, implement it in `exp/` and expose it through the CLI. When a
   published dependency already owns the right contract, prefer its public API; use a separate
   implementation when requirements differ materially and document the boundary.

8. **Keep imports explicit and fail-fast.** Put imports at module scope unless moving them is
   required to break a real circular dependency. Do not use lazy imports for optional convenience,
   and do not catch `ImportError`/`ModuleNotFoundError` to silently fall back to alternate behavior.

9. **Design every public surface from the perspective of a dev using it.** Before implementing a
   feature, write the call site first — the Python snippet or CLI invocation an outside developer
   would type — and judge it: is it obvious, minimal, and hard to misuse? Public surfaces (the
   `exp` Python API, CLI commands, pydantic models) stay small, composable, and explicitly typed.
   Extend via the existing seam for that concern (a canonical trace loader, simulator, runtime
   model client, or router catalog) when that seam matches the new behavior. If it does not,
   introduce a focused abstraction and document why; do not force distinct semantics through an
   ill-fitting seam or accumulate special-case flags. Error messages are part of the interface: a
   failure a user can hit must say what went wrong *and* what to do about it.

10. **Tests protect behavior.** Add regression coverage for evidence, simulation, runtime, router,
    and SFT changes. When practical, start with a failing test. Bug fixes should capture the repro
    before the fix; when that is unsafe or cannot be isolated, explain why and add the strongest
    targeted regression check available. Treat failures as a coevolution loop: a failing test
    means the test or implementation may be wrong. If a test encodes an outdated expectation,
    update or remove it with a stated reason. Never weaken a test merely to get green.

11. **Verify end-to-end before claiming done.** Unit tests passing is necessary, not sufficient.
    For anything with a runtime surface, actually drive it — run the CLI command, hit the served
    endpoint, render the figure — and confirm the observed behavior, not just the exit code.

12. **Improve automated components by inspecting their actual outputs.** Anything automated — an
    LLM judge, a simulator, an optimizer, or a scorer — is tuned against real data, not intuition.
    Pull a sample of its actual inputs and outputs, read them, ask "do I agree with what it did
    here?", and tweak based on the disagreements. A judge prompt is validated by reading its
    scores on real predictions; a simulator by reading its trajectories. Never declare an
    automated component improved without looking at concrete before/after examples.

13. **Run `/ready-for-merge` before every PR merge.** No PR is merged until the
    `ready-for-merge` skill (`.claude/skills/ready-for-merge/SKILL.md`) has been run and passes:
    `/code-review --fix` at an effort level scaled to the PR's breadth (see the skill), every
    review comment (Cursor, Greptile, humans) resolved, and a full AGENTS.md compliance audit
    of the diff. When opening or updating a PR, fetch Greptile review comments in the same
    turn and address them immediately: fix valid findings, reply on the thread, and resolve
    it. Do not wait for `/ready-for-merge` to start that loop.

14. **No silent legacy, shims, or backwards compatibility.** Any legacy path, shim,
    compatibility constant, migration branch, deprecated alias, versioned fallback, or other
    backwards-compatibility mechanism must be reported explicitly and approved before it lands.
    These are costly decisions: they grow the codebase and its complexity permanently. The
    project does not guarantee those contracts right now; with few users we stay flexible and
    remove as much of that weight as we can, because once there are real users the flexibility
    disappears. The default is a hard cutover: stale persisted contracts fail closed and require
    a fresh setup, with no migration path, unless a human explicitly approves one.

15. **All visuals follow the brand system.** Research figures, README/docs images, frontends, and
    any UI must look clean and minimal — Vercel/Notion/Apple-like: white background, generous
    whitespace, no chartjunk, left-aligned titles, hairline grids. All accents come from the brand
    palette; do not introduce ad-hoc colors:
    - Ink (text/titles): `#0a0a0a` · Grid/hairlines: `#ececec` · Background: white
    - Accents, in order of use: `#0070f3` (primary blue), `#7928ca` purple, `#f5a623` amber,
      `#ee0000` red, `#50e3c2` teal
    The palette above is the contract. Rendering scripts for one-off visuals do not belong in the
    repository (rule 5).

## One package

This repo publishes **one distribution**: `experiential`, whose importable code is all of
`exp/` and nothing else. Rules of the road:

- **One package, no workspace**: a dependency is either a normal PyPI requirement in
  `[project.dependencies]` or it is code under `exp/`. `pyproject.toml` declares no uv workspace
  and no path sources, and a member directory would need a new top-level directory that rule 5
  forbids.
- **Keep dependency ownership explicit**: published shared building blocks are normal PyPI
  requirements. Provider-neutral catalog metadata and immutable snapshots live under
  `exp/common/models/`; explicit runtime clients use the shared HTTP transport. A release resolves
  entirely from published requirements plus `exp/`.
- **Gate scoping**: the root gate is `uv run ruff check .`, `uv run ty check`, `uv run pytest -q`,
  all over the single `testpaths = ["exp"]`. Tests are inline `*_test.py` beside the module they
  cover. There is exactly one ruff config and one ty config, at the root.
- **Publishing**: `.github/workflows/python-package.yml` builds and publishes the flagship
  `experiential` distribution; the publish job runs only for a GitHub release and uses
  the `pypi` trusted-publisher environment.

## Docs

The repo is the single source of truth for project docs: finished, production-ready reports in
`docs/` (rule 5). Working docs, plans, and drafts stay outside the checkout (see rule 5) until they
are worth promoting, and project docs go in `docs/` rather than Notion. Promote durable decisions
and evidence to `docs/`; remove obsolete material only after checking references and preserving
anything unique.
