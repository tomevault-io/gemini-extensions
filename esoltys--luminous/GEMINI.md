# Luminous Music Player

## Product Scope

Luminous is not trying to be a best-of-all-worlds app. It covers the tagging, library, and
playback needs of most users well, but it deliberately does not chase feature parity with
specialist tools. For example: if a user needs heavy-duty batch tagging (AcoustID-driven
bulk retagging, complex fingerprint-based lookups, tag scripting), the answer is to direct
them to a dedicated tool like MusicBrainz Picard rather than building that depth into
Luminous. When scoping a feature request, prefer "good enough, well-integrated" over
matching a specialist tool's full depth — and when a request is clearly outside that bar,
recommend the existing dedicated tool instead of expanding scope.

This is not a blanket "no tagging features" rule — the line is *canonical lookup vs. personal
curation*. Picard's job is resolving a file against MusicBrainz's canonical database: correct
artist/album/track identity, official release metadata, AcoustID fingerprint matching, bulk
retagging a whole library against that source of truth. That's squarely out of scope for
Luminous. But organizing music *the user's own way* — layered on top of whatever canonical tags
already exist — is core to what a personal library manager should do, and belongs in Luminous
natively. Example: MusicBrainz has no opinion on whether a track is Folk Metal, Progressive
Metal, or Symphonic Metal — genre is often too broad and any subgenre taxonomy is inherently
personal/subjective. A user-defined tag system for exactly this (see #224) isn't scope creep
into Picard's territory; it's a different, complementary axis Picard was never meant to cover.

## Branching & PR Rules

- NEVER commit or push directly to `main`. All changes ship via PR, even release version bumps and docs-only edits.
- Merging is allowed once — and only once — every check on the PR has actually finished, not just the required ones GitHub's branch-protection summary cares about. Do not treat the green "Able to merge this pull request" banner or the API's `mergeable: MERGEABLE` field as that signal on their own — both go green as soon as required checks pass while non-required checks (e.g. Backend Tests, CodeQL) can still be `in_progress`. Confirm via `gh pr checks <pr> --watch` (blocks until every check concludes) or `gh pr checks <pr>` showing zero `pending`/`in_progress` rows, then run `gh pr merge <pr>`. Tell the user once it's merged.
- PR base branch depends on the target issue's milestone — see Branching Model below (2.0-milestone work targets `next`; everything else targets `main`).
- Before creating a branch, confirm the base: `git fetch origin && git switch -c <branch> origin/<base>`.

## Destructive Operations

- NEVER use `rm -rf`, `git clean`, or unconditional deletes on directories that may contain untracked files. Run `git status --porcelain --ignored` first and list what would be lost.
- `git mv` only works on tracked files — for untracked assets use plain `mv` and verify afterward.
- Prefer moving to a temp dir over deleting; let the user do the final delete.

## Worktrees

- All feature work happens in a dedicated worktree under the standard worktree root (`.claude/worktrees/` for Claude, `.worktrees/<name>/` for other assistants — see Version Control below). NEVER edit files in the main checkout while a worktree exists for that branch.
- Before any Edit/Write, run `pwd` and confirm the path is the intended worktree.
- Never run `bun install` or `cargo build` in the main checkout during worktree work — it dirties `bun.lock`/lockfiles.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: SvelteKit + Svelte 5 (Runes) + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS v4
- **Backend**: Rust (edition 2021) + Tauri v2
- **Database**: SQLite via rusqlite + r2d2
- **Audio**: Symphonia (decode) + CPAL (output)

## Project Structure

- Rust source lives in `src-tauri/src/`; Svelte source in `src/`
- Shared TypeScript types in `src/lib/types/`; Svelte 5 stores (Runes) in `src/lib/stores/`
- No dedicated IPC wrapper layer — components and stores call Tauri commands directly via `invoke()` from `@tauri-apps/api/core`

**Key frontend stores** (`src/lib/stores/*.svelte.ts`):

- `player.svelte.ts` — playback state, queue, volume, shuffle/repeat
- `collection.svelte.ts` — library metadata, folder list
- `playlists.svelte.ts` — playlist CRUD, undo/redo
- `theme.svelte.ts` — color schemes, artwork extraction

**Core Rust modules** (`src-tauri/src/`):

- `audio.rs` — Symphonia decode + CPAL output pipeline with gapless playback
- `player.rs` — playback state machine (shuffle, repeat, queue control)
- `collection.rs` — library scanner (incremental; respects file mod times) + file watcher
- `db.rs` — SQLite schema, connection pool (r2d2), migrations
- `playlist.rs` — playlist CRUD + undo/redo command stack
- `equalizer.rs` — biquad DSP filters (10-band graphic, 20-band parametric)
- `analyzer.rs` — real-time FFT spectrum processing
- `lyrics.rs` — LRCLIB + Lyrics.ovh clients
- `covermanager.rs` — embedded art extraction + iTunes API fallback
- `tageditor.rs` — lofty tag reader/writer + AcoustID fingerprinting
- `commands/` — all `#[tauri::command]` IPC handlers (registry in `commands/mod.rs`)

## Package Manager

- Use **bun** for all JavaScript/TypeScript package management in this project (not npm, yarn, or pnpm).
- Run scripts with `bun run <script>` and install packages with `bun add <package>`.
- Use **bunx** for running one-off CLI tools (not npx/node). Example: `bunx some-tool` instead of `npx some-tool`.

## System Dependencies (Linux)

Required before `cargo check` / `bun run tauri dev`:

```bash
pkexec apt-get install -y libasound2-dev libssl-dev pkg-config libayatana-appindicator3-dev
```

- `libasound2-dev` — ALSA headers needed by the `cpal` audio crate
- `libssl-dev` — OpenSSL headers (needed by some Tauri transitive deps)
- `libayatana-appindicator3-dev` — links the system tray icon (`tray-icon` Cargo feature)
- `pkg-config` — used by build scripts to locate system libraries

## Quick Start Commands

- **Dev server** (frontend hot reload + Rust backend): `bun run tauri dev`
- **Frontend-only dev** (faster, no backend): `bun run dev`
- **Type check / lint**: `bun run check`
- **Frontend tests**: `bun run test:run` (Vitest)
- **Backend tests**: `cd src-tauri && cargo test`
- **Release build**: `bun run tauri build`

## Testing

- **Frontend**: Vitest + @testing-library/svelte; test files are `src/**/*.test.ts` / `*.spec.ts`. Run a single file with `bun run test -- player.test.ts`; watch mode is `bun run test` (no `run` suffix).
- **Backend**: inline unit tests (`#[cfg(test)]`) plus Cucumber BDD in `features/` + `src-tauri/tests/`. Run BDD suites like `cargo test --test equalizer_bdd`.

## Architecture Invariants

- **Allocation-free audio thread**: the playback callback in `audio.rs` must never allocate (no `Vec::push`, `String`, or other heap ops). Pre-allocate buffers on init; use `parking_lot::Mutex` (no poisoning) over `std::sync::Mutex`.
- **Event-driven state**: the frontend always reacts to backend events (e.g. `playback-state`, `track-changed`) and never assumes state after an `invoke()`. This keeps the UI consistent with backend reality.
- **Database migrations**: any schema change in `db.rs` must bump the migration version and stay backwards-compatible during rollout.
- **Command pattern**: IPC handlers in `src-tauri/src/commands/*.rs` are `async`, return `Result<T, String>` (errors serialize to `String`), and access shared state via `AppState` (thread-safe through Arc + Mutex/parking_lot). Prefer *deep* commands that own a whole workflow (e.g. `apply_equalizer_config`, `add_songs_to_queue`) over per-field setters; persistence-only writes the UI can't act on (`set_app_setting`, `set_fade_settings`, EQ saves) are fire-and-forget — they log failures backend-side and never reject.
- **Queue abstraction**: the built-in Queue is bootstrapped at startup and owned by `PlaylistManager::queue()` / `replace_queue()`. Branch on `Playlist.is_queue` (frontend: `playlistsStore.queuePlaylist` / `requireQueue()`); never match the playlist name.
- **Dynamic playlists are always complete**: a genre/decade/BPM auto playlist or user smart playlist always contains exactly the songs matching its definition. Backend listeners on `library-changed` / `song-stats-changed` run `playlist::reconcile_and_sync`, which appends new matches (ordered by the playlist's population-mode rules) and evicts stale rows immediately — without reordering survivors or the live play order; only the explicit Refresh re-sorts. There is no refill mechanism or Auto-Refill setting; do not reintroduce one.

## Design Principles

- **State Preservation**: Luminous must always save and restore the state the user left/closed the application in. When reopened, the user should be returned exactly to where they were (e.g., same sidebar view/tab, same song selection, same player track/position/volume, same equalizer presets/enabled state).
- See [DESIGN.md](../DESIGN.md)

## UI/UX Design Conventions

- **Toast persistence**: Toasts must never auto-dismiss unless an explicit `durationMs` is passed by the
  caller. By default, toasts stay visible until the user clicks the `X` button.

- **Explicit-action-only celebrations**: Micro-animations (heart pulse, confetti, etc.) must fire only in
  response to a deliberate user interaction (e.g., a click handler). Never trigger them from a reactive
  `$effect` or a prop-change watcher — doing so causes false positives when the track changes and a
  different (already-favourited) song loads.

- **Context-aware completion messages**: End-of-queue or completion toasts must include the name of what
  finished (e.g., "Jazz Classics complete"), not generic text. The `playerStore.activeContextName` field
  carries this name; auto-playlists (Favourites, Recently Added, etc.) must pass their `displayName` to
  `playerStore.playSongs()` so the context propagates correctly.

- **Icon semantics**: Avoid icons that imply system-level tracking or achievement recording (e.g.,
  `<Trophy>`). For milestone/completion moments, prefer neutral icons like `<Star>` that convey
  "special" without implying a leaderboard or achievement system.

- **Instructive, not descriptive, copy voice**: Hint/help text under a toggle, button, or tab should
  tell the user what to do or what happens when they act ("Scan watched folders for new files"), not
  describe the feature in third person ("Scans watched folders for new files") or lead with an adverb
  ("Automatically scans..."). Match the imperative voice of the control's own label. This applies to
  `src/lib/locales/en.ts` hint/tooltip strings specifically — section headings and status/value labels
  are fine as descriptive text.

## Development Workflow

**Adding a frontend feature:**

1. Create a component in `src/lib/components/`.
2. Update the relevant store in `src/lib/stores/` if state is needed.
3. Hook into the layout or a route (`src/routes/`).
4. Add a Vitest test, then run `bun run check`.

**Adding a backend feature:**

1. Implement the logic in the appropriate module under `src-tauri/src/`.
2. Add a command handler in `src-tauri/src/commands/`.
3. Register the command in `src-tauri/src/commands/mod.rs`.
4. Add unit or BDD tests.
5. Frontend invokes via `invoke("my_command", { args })` and listens for events if needed.

**Database schema changes:**

1. Edit the schema in `db.rs`.
2. Increment the migration version.
3. Keep queries backwards-compatible during rollout.

## Bug Handling

When work on one task surfaces a defect that isn't part of that task — a broken script, a stale
doc, a misconfigured or missing dependency, a UI bug spotted while testing something else, a test
failure unrelated to the change at hand — don't silently label it "pre-existing" or "unrelated" and
move on without telling the user. Surface it plainly (what's broken, what you observed, why you
think it's unrelated to the current change) and ask whether they want it fixed now or filed as a
tracked issue (`gh issue create`, following the Version Control section's issue-creation steps).
Only proceed without asking if the user has already given standing instructions for this exact
situation. This applies even when the defect seems clearly out of scope — "unrelated" is a claim to
verify with the user, not a reason to skip telling them.

## Performance Notes

- Virtualize large lists (collections, playlists) with `svelte-virtual-list-ts`.
- Library scanning is incremental (checks file mod times) and doesn't re-scan unchanged files.
- Database access uses indices, FTS5 for track/album search, and prepared statements.
- Band waveform/FFT analysis runs on a background thread and must not block playback.

## Branching Model

- **`main`** is the rolling 1.x release line. Milestone-1 fixes (and any 1.x feature work) land
  here and ship as rolling releases (1.1, 1.25, 1.44, etc.) per `docs/RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md`.
- **`next`** is the long-lived 2.0 feature-integration branch. New stories tracked under the
  "2.0" GitHub Milestone (see Issue Priority Labels below) target PRs at `next`, not `main`.
  `next` is a branch name — don't confuse it with the "2.0" Milestone used for issue triage;
  they're two different things that happen to be about the same release.
- Keep `next` current by periodically merging `main` into it (`git merge origin/main`, no
  automated sync) — at minimum before starting a new round of 2.0 work, and always right before
  eventually merging `next` back into `main`.
- When the "2.0" Milestone's issues are done, `next` merges into `main` via PR and becomes the
  new baseline. A fresh `next` (or renamed successor) gets cut for whatever comes after that.
- **Interim releases**: 2.0 work that's already done and stable doesn't have to wait for the
  *entire* 2.0 Milestone to finish. It can ship early as a rolling 1.x release (e.g. "1.5") by
  syncing `main` into `next`, merging `next` into `main` via PR, and rolling `main`'s
  `package.json`/`Cargo.toml` version back down to the 1.x line (`next`'s own version, e.g.
  `2.0.0`, stays as-is or gets bumped once `main` no longer matches it). `next` is **not**
  retired by this — it keeps living as the home for whatever 2.0 issues are still open. On
  GitHub, create a milestone matching the release (e.g. "1.5") and move the completed issues'
  milestone from "2.0" to it; issues that are done but belong to a still-open epic can move
  individually while the epic itself stays in "2.0" (split is fine pre-release, since nothing
  user-facing observes the milestone). Repeat this pattern for future interim releases as more
  2.0 work completes ahead of the full 2.0 cut.

## Issue & PR Formatting

- Never hand-wrap lines in GitHub issue/PR bodies — GitHub renders single newlines as hard breaks. Write paragraphs as one long line.
- Always use the repo PR template and the Epic/issue templates in `.github/`.
- For Epic issues: do not list sub-issues in the description body — GitHub automatically shows them below the description if they are properly added as sub-issues (e.g. `gh issue edit <epic-id> --add-sub-issue <ids>`). If there are no related issues, leave the `## Related` section out entirely.
- Do NOT apply priority labels to issues. Priority lives in the Project board only.

## Issue Priority

**NEVER apply a `P1`/`P2`/`P3`/`P4` label to an issue, and never pass `--label P1` (or P2–P4) to
`gh issue create` or `gh issue edit`.** This has happened repeatedly — priority is not a label in
this repo; it's tracked exclusively as a field on the "Luminous Music Player" GitHub Project. See
[docs/ISSUE_PRIORITY.md](docs/ISSUE_PRIORITY.md) for the P1–P4 scheme, and for the `gh project`
commands (with field/option IDs) to read and set both Priority and Status directly — no need to
punt either to the user.

## Version Control

- Make atomic git commits at logical points (e.g., after completing each task phase, after scaffolding, after adding a major feature).
- Use conventional commit messages: `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`, `test:`.
- Stage all relevant files with `git add -A` before committing unless selective staging is needed.
- Proactively search and view GitHub issues using the `gh` command tool (e.g., `gh issue list` and `gh issue view <id>`) when asked to "fix a bug" or "work on a feature".
- When working on a bug or feature, always work in a dedicated git worktree. Note that Claude uses its own worktree flow in `.claude/worktrees/`, while all other AI assistants and agents must place their dedicated worktree in the `.worktrees/` directory (e.g., `.worktrees/<feature-or-bug-name>`). Do not delete the worktree until the changes have been reviewed, merged, and approved for cleanup by the user.
- As soon as you start working a tracked issue, set its Status to "In Progress" on the Project board (see [docs/ISSUE_PRIORITY.md](docs/ISSUE_PRIORITY.md) for the `gh project item-edit` command) — don't leave it sitting at "Todo" while work is underway.
- Present the Walkthrough (`walkthrough.md`) to the user and wait for their explicit feedback and approval before opening or finalizing a PR. Do NOT run `bun run tauri dev` as a background task (it does not work as expected). Ask the user to run the dev server (`bun run tauri dev`) and check manually.
- **Merge once every check has actually finished, not before.** This replaced an earlier blanket "never merge" rule after PRs were repeatedly merged while checks were still running — the CI gate is what matters, not withholding the merge action itself. After creating a PR, watch it with `gh pr checks <pr> --watch` (this blocks until every check concludes, pass or fail) rather than sampling `mergeable`/the GitHub UI banner, which both go green on required-checks-only and can be reported alongside still-`in_progress` non-required checks. Once everything has genuinely concluded and passed, run `gh pr merge <pr>` and tell the user it merged. If any check fails, stop and report it — do not merge, and do not retry the merge command hoping it clears. For a stack of dependent PRs, merge them in order (base before dependent) so each retargets cleanly as its predecessor's branch is deleted.
- Once a PR has merged, confirm the corresponding issues closed and their Status set to "Done" on the Project board. On Windows, `git worktree remove` fails with "Permission denied" on the worktree the current session is running from (open file handles keep it locked) — hand the `git worktree remove`/`git branch -d` commands to the user to run themselves in that case instead of retrying.
- **Creating Issues & Pull Requests**:
  1. Inspect the relevant templates under `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` (e.g., `bug_report.md`, `feature_request.md`, `epic.md`) when creating issues.
  2. Inspect `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` when preparing or creating Pull Requests.
  3. Perform a codebase search or analysis to fill out the template's sections (Description, Root Cause Analysis, Affected Components & Code Locations, Proposed Solution) accurately.
  4. Write the issue or PR body to a temporary scratch file in the workspace or the artifacts scratch directory.
  5. Create the issue using the GitHub CLI:
     - For bugs: `gh issue create --title "<Title>" --body-file "<PathToScratchFile>" --label "bug" --milestone "<Milestone>"`
     - For features: `gh issue create --title "<Title>" --body-file "<PathToScratchFile>" --milestone "<Milestone>"` (no label needed)
     - For epics: `gh issue create --title "Epic: <Title>" --body-file "<PathToScratchFile>" --milestone "<Milestone>"` (no label needed). After creating the epic, link its sub-issues with `gh issue edit <epic-id> --add-sub-issue <id1>,<id2>...`. Never list sub-issues in the issue description body (GitHub automatically shows them below the description when added as sub-issues). If there are no related issues, leave the `## Related` section out entirely.
     - Never add `--label P1`/`P2`/`P3`/`P4` (see Issue Priority above) — priority is a Project
       field, not a label.
  6. Verify the created issue by running `gh issue view <id>`.
  7. Add the issue to the "Luminous Music Player" Project board, set Status to "Todo", and assign
     a Priority using the scheme in [docs/ISSUE_PRIORITY.md](docs/ISSUE_PRIORITY.md) (which also
     has the `gh project item-add` / `item-edit` commands and field/option IDs). Do this for every
     bug or feature issue you create — don't leave the fields unset or punt them to the user.
  8. Before opening a PR that closes/fixes an issue, check that issue's Milestone
     (`gh issue view <id> --json milestone`): if it's "2.0", branch from and target the PR at
     `next`, not `main` (see Branching Model above). Everything else targets `main`. Do this even
     when a branch name was already assigned for the task — the assigned branch name doesn't
     imply a base branch, and defaulting to `main` for 2.0 work is a real regression risk (it
     ships unfinished 2.0 work early). If the issue's milestone changes after the PR is opened,
     re-check whether the base branch still matches and retarget the PR if not.
- **Releases & Tagging**: When tagging a new release, only create and push a single semantic version tag matching the repository's convention (e.g., `vX.Y.Z` where X.Y.Z matches the project version in `package.json`/`Cargo.toml`) to avoid triggering duplicate build workflows in GitHub Actions.

## Git Hooks

- Run `bun run install:git-hooks` once per clone to enable the pre-commit hook, which auto-formats staged Rust files with `cargo fmt`.

## Release & Versioning

- `bun run bump-version` — updates the version in `package.json` + `Cargo.toml`.
- `bun run release` — runs tests, builds, and creates a GitHub release with a `v<version>` tag.
- Tag format is `vX.Y.Z`, matching the version in `package.json` / `Cargo.toml`. Push only a single semver tag to avoid triggering duplicate build workflows.

## Notable Crates

- **Frontend**: `@tauri-apps/api` (IPC bridge), `@testing-library/svelte`, `svelte-virtual-list-ts`.
- **Backend**: `symphonia` (decode), `cpal` (output), `rusqlite` + `r2d2` (SQLite pool), `lofty` (tags), `rustfft` (spectrum), `tokio` (async), `cucumber` (BDD).

## Troubleshooting

Common dev-environment issues (Tauri won't start, type errors, audio crackling, CI-only test
failures, screenshot script quirks) are in [docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) —
check there before debugging from scratch.
