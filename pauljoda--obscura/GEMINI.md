# Obscura Repository Contract

## Commit & Changelog Policy

- **You MUST ALWAYS commit after every set of changes.** Do not wait for the user to ask — commit immediately when a logical unit of work is complete.
- Every meaningful implementation iteration must end in a git commit.
- Use small, reviewable commits with intentional scopes.
- **With every commit you MUST also** add an entry under `## [Unreleased]` in `CHANGELOG.md`, grouped by the Keep a Changelog sections (`Added` / `Changed` / `Fixed` / `Removed` / `Docs`).
- **Do NOT bump `package.json` versions on regular commits.** The version only changes when a release is cut by the Release workflow. Between releases, the root `package.json` carries a pre-release marker such as `0.14.0-dev`, and all workspace packages mirror it.
- Follow [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) and [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).
- Suggested commit style:
  - `chore: bootstrap workspace`
  - `docs: define repo contract`
  - `feat(web): add media library shell`
  - `feat(api): add health and jobs routes`
  - `fix(worker): stabilize queue startup`
- Do not batch unrelated changes into a single commit.
- `chore(release): …` commits are reserved for the Release workflow. Never create them by hand.

### Versioning

- The root `package.json` version is the single source of truth. All workspace `package.json` files must match it exactly.
- Between releases, the version is `X.Y.Z-dev` (for example `0.14.0-dev`), meaning "the next release will be at least `X.Y.Z`". Dev Docker images are tagged `ghcr.io/pauljoda/obscura:dev` and `…:<version>-<short-sha>`.
- Release versions are plain `X.Y.Z` with no suffix. They always have a matching `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD` heading in `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Git release tags are `vX.Y.Z`.
- The Dockerfile runs `pnpm release:check` on every build, and `pnpm release:check --release` on release builds (via the `RELEASE_STRICT=1` build arg), which enforces that a versioned CHANGELOG heading matches `package.json`.
- **MAJOR**: Breaking API changes, DB schema changes requiring manual migration, config format changes.
- **MINOR**: New features, new API endpoints, new UI views.
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes, UI tweaks, dependency updates, docs.

### How to publish a release

Releases are cut server-side by the GitHub Actions `Release` workflow. Do not hand-edit versions, hand-edit CHANGELOG release headings, or push release tags manually.

1. Make sure `main` is green, all the changes you want in the release are merged, and `## [Unreleased]` in `CHANGELOG.md` is populated with human-readable entries — these become the GitHub Release body verbatim.
2. Open the repository on GitHub → **Actions** → **Release** → **Run workflow**.
3. Pick the bump level (`patch` / `minor` / `major`) or paste an explicit `X.Y.Z` version (overrides the bump).
4. The workflow will:
   1. Run `scripts/release/cut.mjs --phase release` on main, which bumps every `package.json` to `X.Y.Z`, converts `## [Unreleased]` into `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD` (leaving a fresh empty `## [Unreleased]` above it), and writes `RELEASE_NOTES.md`.
   2. Create commit `chore(release): vX.Y.Z` and tag `vX.Y.Z`.
   3. Run `scripts/release/cut.mjs --phase post`, which bumps every `package.json` to the next dev marker (`X.Y.(Z+1)-dev`) and commits `chore(release): begin vX.Y.(Z+1)-dev cycle`.
   4. Push both commits to `main` and push the tag.
   5. Check out the release tag and build the unified Docker image with `RELEASE_STRICT=1`, pushing it to GHCR as `latest`, `X.Y.Z`, `X.Y`, and `X`.
   6. Create a GitHub Release for `vX.Y.Z` with `RELEASE_NOTES.md` as the body.
5. The `Build Dev Image` workflow is wired to skip any commit whose message starts with `chore(release):`, so the release commit and post-release dev-bump commit do not double-trigger a dev build.
6. If the release workflow fails partway through, the tag may already exist. Delete the tag (`git push --delete origin vX.Y.Z`) before retrying. Only do this when you're certain the release image and GitHub Release have not been published.

### Release notes discipline

- **Every release section (including `## [Unreleased]`) MUST begin with a `### What's New` block** before the standard Keep a Changelog groups. This is a plain-language summary of user-visible highlights — written so a non-technical user can scan it and know what changed. Keep each bullet to 1–2 sentences. Only include features, major fixes, or behavioral changes a user would notice; skip internal refactors, code cleanup, and dependency bumps.
- When adding a changelog entry during development: if the change is a new feature, a significant UI change, or a notable bug fix, **also add or update a bullet in `### What's New`**. Minor internal changes (refactors, code splits, dev tooling) only go in the standard sections below.
- The standard Keep a Changelog sections (`### Added`, `### Changed`, `### Fixed`, `### Removed`, `### Docs`) follow after `### What's New` and contain the full detailed entries as before.
- Entries should be written for users of the app, not for the diff reader. Explain user-visible behavior and why it changed.
- Use past tense and lead with the user-visible change (`"Subtitles now…"`), not the implementation detail.

## Product

Obscura is a private self-hosted media browser. It is video-first, but supports images and galleries as first-class library entities. Optimized for a single trusted user on a private LAN, deployed via Docker.

## Project Structure

```
apps/web/          — Next.js 15 App Router frontend (port 8008)
apps/api/          — Fastify 5 HTTP API (port 4000)
apps/worker/       — pg-boss background worker

packages/ui/       — Design tokens, shared components (shadcn/ui base)
packages/contracts/ — Typed DTOs, route constants, job identifiers
packages/db/       — Shared Drizzle schema and database utilities
packages/media-core/ — File discovery, fingerprint, scan primitives
packages/stash-import/ — Stash migration adapter

infra/docker/      — Dockerfiles and dev compose stack
scripts/release/   — Version validation tooling
docs/              — Architecture and design language docs
```

## Architecture

- Monorepo with `pnpm` workspaces and `turbo`.
- Three services: web (Next.js), api (Fastify), worker (pg-boss).
- PostgreSQL 16 is the sole stateful dependency — used for both application data and the job queue.
- All services share typed contracts via `@obscura/contracts`.

## Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Separate services** — UI, API, and worker run as independent processes. This keeps concerns isolated and allows independent scaling.
2. **PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM** — Typed schema with push-based migrations during development, SQL migration files for production.
3. **pg-boss job queue** — Postgres-backed job queues for scan, probe, thumbnail, sprite, HLS, and import jobs. Job state is mirrored into the `job_runs` table, which is the single source of truth for the Operations dashboard. No Redis.
4. **HLS streaming** — Videos are transcoded to HLS on demand via ffmpeg. Cached renditions are served by the API.
5. **Stash as import source** — Stash is a migration/import source, not the application schema. Imported data is normalized into Obscura-owned tables.
6. **Typed contracts** — All DTOs, route paths, and job identifiers live in `@obscura/contracts` and are shared across all apps.

## Database

- PostgreSQL 16 via `postgres` driver and `drizzle-orm`.
- Schema defined in `packages/db/src/schema.ts` and re-exported from `apps/api/src/db/schema.ts`.
- Core entities: videos (series/seasons/episodes/movies), performers, studios, tags, fingerprints, library_roots, settings.
- **Versioned migrations, not `push`, ship in releases.** Migration SQL files live under `apps/api/drizzle/` and are applied by `apps/api/src/db/migrate.ts`, which runs automatically inside the API server at boot (`apps/api/src/server.ts`). Each file records a row in `drizzle.__drizzle_migrations` so migrations apply exactly once per database.
- **Adding a schema change:**
  1. Edit `packages/db/src/schema.ts`.
  2. Run `pnpm --filter @obscura/api db:generate` to produce a new `drizzle/NNNN_<name>.sql` file.
  3. **Open the file and read it.** drizzle-kit is conservative but will emit destructive SQL (drops, column renames seen as drop+add) when it can't tell your intent — fix it by hand before committing. Use `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS` when the drop needs to be safe on installs that may already lack the table.
  4. Commit the `.sql` file, the new `drizzle/meta/NNNN_snapshot.json`, and the updated `drizzle/meta/_journal.json` alongside the schema edit.
  5. Apply locally by restarting the API (or running `pnpm --filter @obscura/api db:migrate`) and verify.
- **Never run `db:push` against a deployment you care about.** It bypasses the migration ledger and can apply destructive drops silently.

### Breaking-change policy

Obscura is pre-1.0. We do not maintain a staging/finalize data-migration framework or a push-era legacy-install bridge. When a schema change would destroy user data (e.g. dropping a populated table), do this instead:

1. Ship the change as a normal drizzle migration with `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS` / idempotent SQL.
2. Call out the break in `CHANGELOG.md` under `### What's New` — describe what breaks, what the user should do (usually "rescan your library roots"), and why.
3. If the data loss is severe enough that we want explicit consent before it happens, add a single-purpose one-time break-gate next to the migration. See `apps/api/src/db/breaking-gate.ts` (the v0.20 scenes→videos gate) for the pattern: marker file on disk, gate check runs before the migrator, a consent UI (`apps/web/src/components/system/breaking-upgrade-gate.tsx`) takes over the app shell until the user clicks through. Don't abstract this into a framework — copy the pattern if a future break needs it, or delete the old gate when it's no longer relevant.

No bridges, no staging tables, no legacy-schema snapshots. Early users expect breakage; make it loud and move on.

## Design System Rules

- Follow the `Dark Room` visual direction (see `docs/design-language.md`).
- **Sharp corners everywhere** — `border-radius: 0` on all elements, no exceptions.
- **Material base + glass overlay** — solid dark surfaces as the ground layer; glass (`backdrop-filter: blur` + semi-transparent fill) for floating and interactive elements.
- Five-level material surface hierarchy: bg → surface-1 → surface-2 → surface-3 → surface-4. Three glass layers: glass-1 → glass-2 → glass-3.
- Brass accent (`#c49a5a`) — used only on active/selected states. Always expressed with glow (`box-shadow` blur), never flat. Accent gradients for fills.
- **Mobile first** — design and build for mobile layout first. Desktop is an expansion, not a fallback.
- Three font voices: Geist (headings), Inter (body), JetBrains Mono (utility/metadata).
- Glow and animation express state — selection, focus, and activity use `glow-pulse` or full glow `box-shadow`. No static color-only state changes.
- Avoid generic SaaS styling and unmodified shadcn defaults.
- Core actions must not depend on hover-only affordances.

## Data & Integration Rules

- Do not embed the legacy Stash schema as the application schema.
- Treat Stash as a migration/import source and conceptual reference.
- Normalize imported hashes and metadata into Obscura-owned tables and contracts.
- Keep provider integrations behind stable adapter interfaces.

## Quality Bar

- TypeScript is required across apps and packages.
- Prefer typed contracts over ad hoc object shapes.
- Add tests with new logic when behavior can regress.
- Keep app boundaries explicit: UI in `apps/web`, transport in `apps/api`, heavy work in `apps/worker`, shared logic in `packages/*`.

## Docker

- Development: `docker compose -f infra/docker/docker-compose.yml up` runs all services with hot reload.
- Production: single unified image (`ghcr.io/pauljoda/obscura`) bundles PostgreSQL, nginx, ffmpeg, and all three services.
- Per-service Dockerfiles remain in `infra/docker/` for development; the unified build uses `infra/docker/unified.Dockerfile`.
- nginx reverse proxy on port 8008 routes `/api/*` to Fastify (4000) and everything else to Next.js (3000) internally.
- Volumes: `/data` (database, cache, thumbnails) and `/media` (user media library).

## CI/CD

Two GitHub Actions workflows manage the image lifecycle:

- **`.github/workflows/publish-dev.yml`** (`Build Dev Image`) — runs on every push to `main` (except `chore(release):` commits). Builds the unified image with `RELEASE_STRICT=0` and publishes it to `ghcr.io/pauljoda/obscura` as:
  - `dev` — always the latest commit on `main`
  - `sha-<short-sha>` — pinned per commit, for rollback
  - `<version>-<short-sha>` — e.g. `0.14.0-abc1234`, where `<version>` is the current `-dev` marker in `package.json`
- **`.github/workflows/release.yml`** (`Release`) — manual `workflow_dispatch` only. Bumps the version, rewrites the CHANGELOG, commits + tags, builds the release image with `RELEASE_STRICT=1`, pushes it as `latest`, `X.Y.Z`, `X.Y`, and `X`, and creates a GitHub Release with the extracted changelog section as the body. See **How to publish a release** above.

`latest` always resolves to the most recent released version. Users who want the bleeding edge should pin `dev`. Users who want a known-good build from a specific commit should pin `sha-<short-sha>`.

- Uses Docker Buildx with GitHub Actions cache.
- Platform: `linux/amd64`.

## Tooling Expectations

- Avoid destructive git commands unless explicitly requested.
- Keep the repo runnable via Docker Compose.
- Prefer lightweight validation commands before committing.
