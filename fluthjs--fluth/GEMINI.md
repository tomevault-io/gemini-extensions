## Development Standards

### Language Requirements

- **All code must be written in English** - Variable names, function names, class names, and all identifiers
- **All comments must be in English** - Including JSDoc comments, inline comments, and documentation
- **All commit messages must be in English** - Following conventional commit format
- **All documentation must be in English** - README, API docs, and inline documentation

### File Naming Conventions

- Source files use lowercase letters and hyphens
- Test files end with `.test.ts`
- Configuration files named according to tool requirements

### Code Organization Standards

- Core functionality code in `src/` directory
- Each module has corresponding test files
- Public APIs exported uniformly through `index.ts`
- Plugins and operators organized in separate files

### Operator Design Rules

#### Stream Lifecycle Management

- When designing operators with stream inputs and outputs, consider the impact of input streams that are already finished on the output stream
- When designing operators with stream inputs and outputs, consider the impact of input stream unsubscription on the output stream
- When designing operators with stream inputs and outputs, consider the impact of output stream unsubscription on the input stream
- When designing operators with stream inputs and outputs, consider the impact of input empty
- Properly handle stream completion and unsubscription propagation in both directions

#### Memory Management

- When designing operators with stream inputs and outputs, consider memory leak issues
- Implement proper cleanup mechanisms for all subscriptions and references
- Use `useUnsubscribeCallback` utility for managing multiple stream unsubscriptions
- Clear arrays and references in cleanup callbacks to prevent memory leaks
- Handle circular references and parent-child relationships properly

#### Input Validation and Edge Cases

- Thoroughly consider input boundary conditions when designing operators
- Validate input types and throw appropriate errors for invalid inputs
- Handle empty input scenarios gracefully
- Consider single stream vs multiple stream scenarios
- Handle mixed valid/invalid input combinations

#### Status and State Management

- Properly track and propagate PromiseStatus (PENDING, RESOLVED, REJECTED)
- Handle already finished streams correctly during operator initialization
- Ensure consistent status updates across all stream operations
- Implement proper finishCount tracking for multiple stream scenarios

#### Operator Function Design Patterns

- Use higher-order functions that return operator functions for pipe syntax compatibility
- Return new Stream instances rather than modifying existing ones
- Implement proper type inference for input/output stream types
- Use StreamTupleValues type for operators that work with multiple streams

#### Error Handling and Propagation

- Implement comprehensive error handling for all operator scenarios
- Properly propagate errors from input streams to output streams
- Handle Promise rejections and exceptions within operator logic
- Use Promise.reject() for error propagation in stream emissions

#### Concurrency and Timing

- Consider concurrent execution scenarios for multiple stream inputs
- Handle timing-dependent operations with proper synchronization
- Use appropriate delay mechanisms (utils.sleep) for testing time-dependent behavior
- Implement proper debouncing, throttling, and buffering where needed

#### Cleanup and Resource Management

- Implement afterUnsubscribe callbacks for proper cleanup
- Use offUnsubscribe and offComplete to remove callbacks during cleanup
- Handle nested observable subscriptions and their cleanup
- Ensure all timers and async operations are properly cleaned up

#### Testing Requirements for Operators

- Test with both Stream and Observable inputs
- Test with already finished streams
- Test unsubscribe behavior and cleanup
- Test error propagation and rejection scenarios
- Test edge cases like empty inputs, single inputs, and mixed scenarios
- Verify proper finishCount and status tracking

## Test Rules

### Test Coverage Requirements

- Tests should cover all function functionalities including normal cases, exception cases, and boundary cases
- Each public API must have corresponding test cases
- Error handling and edge cases should be thoroughly tested
- Input validation should be tested with both valid and invalid inputs

### Test Organization and Structure

- Test cases should be generated around function features and logically ordered
- Tests should be structured so that function capabilities can be quickly understood through test cases
- Group related test cases using descriptive test names
- Avoid nested describe blocks (user preference)
- Use clear, descriptive test descriptions that explain what is being tested

### Test Quality Standards

- Tests should be deterministic and repeatable
- Use appropriate test utilities like `streamFactory`, `sleep`, `consoleSpy`
- **The stream does not need sleep when next synchronous data, but only when next asynchronous data**
- Mock external dependencies appropriately
- Test both success and failure scenarios
- Verify expected behavior through assertions, not just absence of errors

### Test operator rules

- test operators with stream inputs and outputs, consider the impact of input streams that are already finished on the output stream
- test operators with stream inputs and outputs, consider the impact of input stream unsubscription on the output stream
- test operators with stream inputs and outputs, consider the impact of output stream unsubscription on the input stream
- test operators with stream inputs and outputs, consider the impact of input empty
- test operators with stream inputs and outputs, consider the impact of input stream that is not finished on the output stream

### Debugging and Problem Resolution

- **Critical Rule**: If generated test cases cannot pass, investigate whether there are issues with the function implementation rather than constantly adjusting test cases to make them pass
- When tests fail, analyze the root cause systematically
- Document and report actual vs expected behavior clearly
- Use test failures as indicators of potential bugs in the implementation

### Project-Specific Guidelines

- For operators, test with pipe syntax as required by the project
- Use `utils.sleep` instead of manual Promise-based delays
- Use `streamFactory` to create Stream instances consistently
- When testing `observable$.execute()`, always use `stream$.next('test value')` to trigger execution
- Test unsubscribe behavior and cleanup mechanisms
- Verify proper status propagation (RESOLVED/REJECTED/PENDING)
- Test completion callbacks and afterComplete/afterUnsubscribe hooks

### Test Environment Setup

- Use fake timers when testing time-dependent behavior
- Clean up spies and mocks between tests
- Handle unhandled promise rejections appropriately
- Set appropriate process limits for concurrent operations

### Code Quality in Tests

- All test code comments must be written in English
- Use TypeScript types appropriately in test code
- Follow the same code quality standards as production code
- Keep tests maintainable and readable
