# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Jirafly is a CLI tool for Jira analytics and team sprint planning. It calculates metrics that Jira doesn't provide natively, including team capacity planning, work ratio analysis (maintenance vs product development), and sprint statistics.

**Technology Stack:**
- Python 3.12
- Typer CLI framework
- Jira Python library + direct REST API calls
- uv for dependency management
- Pydantic for configuration validation
- PrettyTable for terminal output

## Development Commands

**Setup:**
```bash
# Install dependencies and sync
uv sync --dev

# Install pre-commit hooks
uv run pre-commit install
```

**Running the CLI:**
```bash
# Sprint planning (requires sprint identifier like "6.12")
uv run jirafly planning <sprint_id> configs/team.yaml

# Work ratio analysis
uv run jirafly ratio configs/team.yaml

# Override team member settings via CLI
uv run jirafly planning <sprint_id> configs/team.yaml --member peter=7.0,0.3 --member jane=5.0,0.5
```

**Code Quality:**
```bash
# Format and lint with ruff
uv run pre-commit run --all-files
```

**Adding Dependencies:**
```bash
# Runtime dependencies
uv add $PACKAGE_NAME

# Development dependencies
uv add --dev $PACKAGE_NAME
```

## Configuration

**Environment Variables (.env file required):**
- `JIRA_URL` - Jira server URL (e.g., https://yourcompany.atlassian.net)
- `JIRA_EMAIL` - Email for Jira authentication
- `JIRA_TOKEN` - Jira API token
- `PLANNING_FILTER_ID` - Jira filter ID for planning command
- `RATIO_FILTER_ID` - Jira filter ID for ratio analysis command

**Team Configuration (configs/team.yaml):**
```yaml
members:
  - name: "John Doe"      # Must match Jira assignee display name
    nickname: john        # Short identifier for CLI overrides
    wd: 5.0              # Working days per sprint (0-10)
    vel: 0.4             # Velocity factor (productivity multiplier)

working_days_per_sprint:
  "6.12":
    total: 25.0          # Total team working days for sprint 6.12
```

Team capacity is calculated as: `wd × vel` per member.

## Architecture

**Core Components:**

1. **jira_service.py** - Jira API client
   - Uses Jira Python library for authentication and filter retrieval
   - Uses direct REST API (`/rest/api/3/search/jql`) for pagination (fetches all issues with nextPageToken)
   - Excludes Epic issue types from task lists

2. **models.py** - Data models and formatting
   - `Task` class with `from_raw_issue()` factory method to parse Jira API responses
   - Custom field mappings (HLE, WSJF, Tech Leads, Sprint)
   - Task categorization: Product, Bug, Maintenance, Excluded (based on labels and issue type)
   - Version extraction logic: strips dates and normalizes to X.Y format (e.g., "6.12.0 (16. 9. - 29. 9)" → "6.12")

3. **team_config.py** - Team configuration management
   - Pydantic models for validation: `TeamConfig`, `TeamMember`, `SprintWorkingDays`
   - CLI override system using nicknames
   - Converts between dict formats for internal use

4. **cli.py** - Command implementations
   - `planning` command: Sprint capacity planning with task assignment analysis
   - `ratio` command: Maintenance vs Product work ratio analysis with time tracking
   - Both commands support team member overrides via `--member` flag

5. **utils.py** - Display utilities (PrettyTable formatting, color coding)

6. **sprints.py** - Sprint calendar
   - Sprints are 14 days, Tuesday to the second Monday
   - Everything is derived from one anchor (`6.33` = 2026-07-21), no date table
   - `parse()` accepts `6.34`, `current`, `prev`, `next`, `-2`
   - Only computes within `ANCHOR_MAJOR`; a different major raises `SprintError`

7. **absence_store.py** - Attendance snapshots
   - `build_snapshot()` turns raw absence days into per-member working days
   - Stored in `~/.jirafly/absences.json`, keyed by sprint label; kept outside
     the repo because it holds colleagues' absence data
   - Read by `planning` so it never needs Pinya or a browser

8. **pinya_service.py** - Pinya HR client (absences)
   - No API access, so it calls the same JSON endpoints as Pinya's web UI:
     `POST /Team/GetJson`, `POST /HR/Absence/EmployeeGrid_Read`,
     `POST /Calendar/Team` (Kendo grids, form-encoded, no antiforgery token)
   - Playwright carries the session (Azure SSO + MFA cannot be automated);
     profile in `~/.jirafly/pinya-profile`, headless unless login is needed
   - Optional dependency: `uv sync --extra pinya`

**Key Custom Fields (from models.py):**
- `customfield_11605` - HLE (estimate)
- `customfield_11737` - WSJF (priority score)
- `customfield_11606` - Tech Lead 1st
- `customfield_11634` - Tech Lead 2nd
- `customfield_10000` - Sprint

**Task Categorization Logic:**
- Excluded: Has "RatioExcluded" or "Bughunting" label
- Maintenance: Has "Maintenance" or "DevOps" label
- Bug: Issue type is "Bug"
- Product: Everything else

## Data Flow

**Planning Command:**
1. Load team config (YAML) and apply CLI overrides
2. Fetch tasks from Jira filter (via `PLANNING_FILTER_ID`)
3. Group tasks by assignee and calculate total HLE per member
4. Compare against team capacity (wd × vel)
5. Display capacity utilization with color-coded warnings for overallocation

**Ratio Command:**
1. Load team config for working days per sprint data
2. Fetch tasks from Jira filter (via `RATIO_FILTER_ID`)
3. Group by fix version and categorize (Maintenance/Bug/Product/Excluded)
4. Calculate HLE ratios and time spent percentages per sprint
5. Display efficiency metric: (total HLE + excluded) / working days
6. Show overall maintenance vs product ratio across all sprints

**Absences Command:**
1. Resolve the sprint to a date range via `sprints.parse()`
2. Load team config; only members listed there are reported on
3. Fetch roster, absence records and public holidays from Pinya
4. Working days per member: `nominal wd − absences − public holidays`
5. Store the snapshot for `planning` (unless `--no-save`)
6. `--yaml` prints a `working_days_per_sprint` block for the `ratio` command

Verified against manually maintained numbers for sprints 6.26-6.32: 6 of 7 match
exactly, including the holiday deductions in 6.27 and 6.31. In 6.26 the command
reports 2 days more absence for one member than the hand-written comment - the
absence exists in Pinya but was likely booked after the sprint was planned, so
the command reflects Pinya's current state rather than the state at planning
time.

**Working Days Precedence in `planning`** (`apply_attendance()` in cli.py):
1. `--member nickname=wd,vel` from the command line
2. Stored attendance snapshot for that sprint
3. Nominal `wd` from `configs/team.yaml`

Velocity is never taken from Pinya. Note that `planning` uses `members[].wd`
while `ratio` uses `working_days_per_sprint[sprint].total` - two separate places
for the same kind of number.

## Pinya Absence Gotchas

- **Working days come from the `Units` per-day breakdown**, where Pinya already
  zeroes weekends and holidays. Days = booked hours / daily shift, which handles
  half days and part-time contracts. Filtering happens per day, so an absence
  crossing a sprint boundary splits correctly.
- **Public holidays must be subtracted separately** — Pinya keeps them out of
  absence Units, so they never appear as absences but still cost capacity.
- **Holidays are per member, not global.** A holiday only costs someone a day if
  they work that weekday; `off_days` in team.yaml carries this. For a member on a
  four-day week, a holiday on their day off costs nothing - getting this wrong
  made one sprint come out 2 days short.
- **`includeMe=true` is ignored** by `EmployeeGrid_Read`; it only ever returns
  subordinates. Own records need a second call with `employeeId`.
- **Own records come back with `EmployeeName: null` and
  `EmployeeDayWorkingShift: 0`** — the name is filled in from the roster and the
  shift is derived from the longest day in `Units`.
- **`managerId=""` returns the whole company.** Always scope by `managerId` or
  `employeeId`; Kendo's `filter[filters][...]` is ignored server-side.

## Important Implementation Details

- **Version Normalization**: Both fix versions and sprints are normalized to X.Y format (first two dot-separated parts)
- **Sprint Highlighting**: Tasks from previous sprints are highlighted in red in planning output
- **Time Tracking**: Ratio command uses `timetracking.timeSpentSeconds` field
- **Pagination**: Jira fetch uses nextPageToken pagination (max 100 results per page)
- **Assignee Matching**: Team member names in config must exactly match Jira `assignee.displayName`
- **URL Formatting**: Task URLs are hardcoded to mallpay.atlassian.net domain (see models.py:131)

# Rules
- **ABSOLUTELY NEVER mention Claude, AI, or code generation in commit messages, MR descriptions, or comments**.
