# OpenLinker – Claude Code Guide

OpenLinker is an open-source, modular, API-first e-commerce orchestration platform built on **Hexagonal Architecture** (Ports and Adapters) in a pnpm monorepo.

## Reference Documentation

Before writing or modifying code, read the relevant doc(s):

| Topic | File |
|---|---|
| System architecture, layers, bounded contexts | `docs/architecture-overview.md` |
| Coding standards, naming, file structure | `docs/engineering-standards.md` |
| Testing standards and practices | `docs/testing-guide.md` |
| Code review standards | `docs/code-review-guide.md` |
| Database migration workflow | `docs/migrations.md` |
| Frontend technical architecture and state rules | `docs/frontend-architecture.md` |
| Frontend visual and interaction style | `docs/frontend-ui-style-guide.md` |
| Implementation plan process | `docs/implementation-plan-generator-guide.md` |

Architecture docs define **intent and direction**, not every implementation detail. You may infer missing layers or patterns if they clearly align — but always justify them explicitly.

## Architecture Rules

### Backend

The system follows Hexagonal Architecture organized by layer:

- **CORE** (`libs/core/src/`) — domain logic, ports (interfaces), core services. Platform-agnostic.
- **Integrations** (`libs/integrations/`) — adapters implementing CORE ports for external platforms (Allegro, PrestaShop, etc.)
- **Infrastructure** — persistence (PostgreSQL via TypeORM), Redis, repositories
- **Interface** — REST controllers, request/response DTOs, event handlers
- **Shared** (`libs/shared/`) — cross-cutting utilities and types

**CORE vs Integration boundary is strict:**
- CORE defines capability ports (`ProductMasterPort`, `InventoryMasterPort`, `OrderProcessorManagerPort`, etc.)
- Integrations implement those ports — they never bleed domain logic back into CORE
- Do not blur this boundary for convenience

### Frontend

The frontend lives in `apps/web` and is a browser-first admin SPA. See `docs/frontend-architecture.md` for all conventions.

Dependency direction is enforced:
- `app` → `pages` → `features` → `shared`
- `shared` must not import `features` or `pages`

State ownership:
- Server state → TanStack Query
- URL state → route params / search params
- Form state → React Hook Form
- Session state → `SessionProvider`
- Local UI state → component-local `useState` / `useReducer`
- No general-purpose global store for FE-001

---

## Naming Conventions (Summary)

See `docs/engineering-standards.md` for the full list. Key patterns:

**Backend:**
- Ports: `*.port.ts` → class `{Capability}Port`
- Adapters: `*-adapter.ts` → class `{Platform}{Capability}Adapter`
- Services: `*.service.ts` implementing `*.service.interface.ts`
- Entities: `*.entity.ts`, ORM entities: `*.orm-entity.ts`
- Mappers: `*.mapper.ts`, DTOs: `*.dto.ts`
- Unit tests: `*.spec.ts`, integration tests: `*.int-spec.ts`

**Frontend:**
- Components: `PascalCase.tsx`
- Hooks: `use-*.ts`
- Route modules: `*.route.tsx`
- Tests: `*.test.tsx`

---

## Behavior Rules

- **Do not** redefine or reinterpret architecture — follow what the docs say
- **Do not** duplicate architectural explanations in code or comments
- **Do not** bypass CORE ↔ Integration boundaries
- **Prefer** reusing existing abstractions over creating new ones
- **Default** to MVP-appropriate solutions unless explicitly told otherwise
- **Justify** any new pattern, abstraction, or component explicitly

## Code Quality Rules

### Never do these

- No `any` in TypeScript — use proper types or `unknown` with narrowing
- No `console.log` — use the shared `Logger` from `libs/shared/src/logging/`
- No comments that explain *what* code does — comments explain *why*
- No hardcoded secrets, tokens, or credentials anywhere in code
- No `.env` files committed to git
- No `synchronize: true` in TypeORM config — migrations are the source of truth
- No force-push to `main`
- No skipping hooks with `--no-verify`
- No `// eslint-disable` without a specific reason in the same comment

### Security baselines

- Validate all user input at system boundaries (controllers, DTOs with class-validator)
- Use TypeORM query builder — never interpolate user input into raw SQL
- Never return secrets, tokens, or credentials in API responses
- Never embed secrets in frontend code — only `VITE_*` public build-time vars in browser code
- Use `@UseGuards(JwtAuthGuard)` on all non-public endpoints

### TypeScript

- Strict mode is on — no implicit `any`, no loose null checks
- Prefer explicit return types on public methods and exported functions
- Use `unknown` over `any` when type is genuinely unknown; narrow with type guards
- Keep types close to where they are used — colocate with the module that owns them

## Working Process

### For code tasks

1. Read relevant documentation and find similar existing patterns in the codebase
2. Propose what will be implemented now vs. what can be deferred
3. Implement conservatively — only what is required, keep changes localized
4. Add or update tests for non-trivial logic
5. Run the quality gate before committing (see below)
6. Commit on a dedicated branch named after the issue (e.g. `55-100-fe-api-client-and-query-layer`)
7. Push and open a PR with `Closes #N` in the body — **never close an issue manually before the PR is merged**

**Branch naming:** `{issue-number}-{short-kebab-description}` branched from `main`
**Issue lifecycle:** open → PR in review → merged → auto-closed by GitHub via `Closes #N`

### Quality gate (run before every commit)

```bash
pnpm lint        # must pass with zero errors
pnpm type-check  # must pass with zero errors
pnpm test        # all unit tests must pass
```

For backend schema changes: also run `pnpm --filter @openlinker/api migration:show` to confirm no pending migrations are missing.

### Commit signing

All commits must use `git commit -s` (DCO sign-off — appends a `Signed-off-by:` trailer that certifies the contribution under the [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/)). GPG signing is handled by global git config; no `-S` flag is needed at commit time.

### For implementation plans

Use `/plan <description or issue>`. Plans are saved to `docs/plans/implementation-plan-{feature-name}.md`.

### For code review

Use `/tech-review <file or diff>` for a quick pass or `/pr-review <PR number>` for a full systematic review.

### For migrations

A migration is required whenever an ORM entity in `libs/core/src/**/*.orm-entity.ts` changes schema.
Use `/migrate <description>` to generate, validate, and verify the migration.
See `docs/migrations.md` for the full workflow.

```bash
# Dev stack (Postgres, Redis, MySQL, PrestaShop)
pnpm dev:stack:up
pnpm dev:stack:down

# Start apps
pnpm start:dev:api       # NestJS API on :3000
pnpm start:dev:worker    # Background job worker
pnpm start:dev:web       # React frontend on :5173

# Testing
pnpm test                # Unit tests (fast, no Docker)
pnpm test:watch          # Unit tests in watch mode
pnpm test:cov            # Unit tests with coverage
pnpm test:integration    # Integration tests (requires Docker)

pnpm lint                # ESLint
pnpm type-check          # TypeScript check (no emit)
pnpm format              # Prettier

# Build
pnpm build               # Build all packages
pnpm build:api           # Build API only

# Migrations
pnpm --filter @openlinker/api migration:generate -- src/migrations/MigrationName
pnpm --filter @openlinker/api migration:run
pnpm --filter @openlinker/api migration:revert
pnpm --filter @openlinker/api migration:show
```

## Testing Rules (Summary)

See `docs/testing-guide.md` for the full guide.

| | Unit tests | Integration tests |
|---|---|---|
| File pattern | `*.spec.ts` | `*.int-spec.ts` |
| Location | Colocated with source in `src/` | `test/integration/` |
| Command | `pnpm test` | `pnpm test:integration` |
| Requires Docker | No | Yes (Testcontainers) |
| Speed | Fast (~2–3s total) | Slow (~10–15s per suite) |

**Key rules:**
- Unit tests mock all external dependencies (DB, HTTP, Redis)
- Integration tests use real Postgres + Redis via Testcontainers — never mock the database
- Use `resetTestHarness()` between integration tests to clean state
- Test names: `should [expected behaviour] when [condition]`
- Aim for 80%+ unit test coverage; integration tests cover critical vertical slices only

---

## Tech Stack

**Backend:** TypeScript (strict), NestJS, Node.js LTS, pnpm workspaces, PostgreSQL (TypeORM), Redis, RabbitMQ

**Frontend:** React + TypeScript, Vite, React Router, TanStack Query, React Hook Form + Zod, Vitest + Testing Library
