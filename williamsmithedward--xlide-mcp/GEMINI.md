# Working on xlide_mcp

An MCP server for the inside of an Office file: the VBA in Excel, Word,
PowerPoint and Access, and the document around it. Visual Basic 6 projects open
the same way.
[README.md](README.md) says what it does. This says how to change it.

Adopt these first:

- `F:\GitHub\RIDM_Recursive_Invariant_Discovery_Model\RIDM.MD`
- `F:\GitHub\AI_Best_Practices\docs\agentic_ai_programming_best_practices.md`
- `F:\GitHub\AI_Best_Practices\docs\ai_smells_for_agents_to_avoid.md`
- `F:\GitHub\AI_Best_Practices\docs\ui_ux_guidelines_for_agents.md`

## The one rule that shapes everything else

**Python is normative. Every other implementation ports from it.**

`python/` tracks the upstream libraries. A sibling directory per language tracks
`python/`. Changes flow one way: implement in Python, regenerate the contract, and
the diff under `contract/` is the work list for every port. A port that fixes
something Python has wrong fixes it in Python too, or the fix is lost at the next
sync.

This is not a preference about languages. The server is a thin layer over four
libraries that hold the measured knowledge of the Office file formats:

| Library | What it knows |
|---|---|
| [pyOpenVBA](https://github.com/WilliamSmithEdward/pyOpenVBA) | How to read and write VBA, UserForm designs and Power Query inside the containers. |
| [pyOfficeEditor](https://github.com/WilliamSmithEdward/pyOfficeEditor) | The document surface: cells, formulas, formatting, tables, validation, rows and columns. |
| [pyVBAanalysis](https://github.com/WilliamSmithEdward/pyVBAanalysis) | 165 diagnostics, each measured against its host's object model. |
| [pyVBAharness](https://github.com/WilliamSmithEdward/pyVBAharness) | How to run VBA in desktop Office without wedging on a dialog. |

The split between the first two is the file itself: pyOpenVBA edits the VBA
project, pyOfficeEditor edits the document it lives in.

A port reimplements the *server*. It does not reimplement that knowledge, and it
is never the place a format discovery lands: that belongs upstream, and reaches
here through a version bump.

### One debt against that rule, mostly paid

`shapes.py` and `xlsx.py` held format knowledge this server should not own: the
worksheet grid, and the drawing layer where a button keeps the macro it runs.
Both were ported from XLIDE because no library reached either.

**The grid is done.** pyOfficeEditor covers it, so `cells.py` is a thin adapter
over it and the tools read and write through that. The swap was provable rather
than hopeful, which is the point of the corpus: every cell conformance case
passed before and after, unchanged. What the adapter owns is translation, not
format knowledge - an integer where the file stores a double, a leading `=` on a
formula, a JSON-safe date - because those are answers the corpus pins.

**Writing shapes is done, but for one write.** pyOfficeEditor 0.3 adds, removes
and repoints shapes, and keeps a Forms control's four parts in agreement while it
does, so shape writes go through it. The same proof held: every shape
conformance case passed before and after the swap. The one left here is the
macro on a Forms control Excel 2007 saved, which lives only in VML, where
pyOfficeEditor does not look; it goes with the reader.

**Reading shapes still has one legacy gap.** pyOfficeEditor 0.4 now reports the
anchor cells, alt text, hidden state and ActiveX controls, and supplies a public
`cell_origin` for placing a shape at a cell. It does not list a Forms control
saved only in VML by Excel 2007. A regression fixture proves this: its shape list
contains only the ordinary drawing shape after the DrawingML twins are removed.
The reader in `shapes.py`, with `xlsx.py` under it, still reads that control and
its macro; it merges pyOfficeEditor's control state, position and chart series
by name. Once the VML-only control is covered upstream, migrate all reads to
pyOfficeEditor and delete the reader and `xlsx.py` together. The other gaps
were [pyOfficeEditor#4](https://github.com/WilliamSmithEdward/pyOfficeEditor/issues/4).

Until then, nothing new goes into either.

  office.py       the file in the user's own Office: is it open, open it, close it

```

Tool groups are split by what they reach, because that is also how they fail: the
file layer works anywhere, execution and the office tools need Windows with the
application, and the live layer needs the VBE add-in running. XLIDE for VS Code
is not a layer: when it is running, every write tells it what changed, and when
it is not, nothing notices (docs/xlide-vscode-bridge.md).

## Before you change a tool

Read [contract/README.md](contract/README.md) for what the generated files mean.
Then, in order:

1. Change the Python implementation.
2. `cd python && python -m pytest` - no Office needed.
3. `python -m ruff check src tests tools`
4. `python tools/export_contract.py && python tools/export_conformance.py`
5. A new or renamed tool goes in both READMEs: [README.md](README.md) and
   [python/README.md](python/README.md), which is the PyPI page.
6. On Windows with Office: `python -m pytest -m live`.

Steps 4 and 5 are not optional and cannot be skipped quietly. The contract is
derived from the running server precisely so it cannot drift from it, and
`tests/test_contract.py` fails when either artifact is stale.
`tests/test_docs.py` does the same for the documents: it reads the tool names and
the conformance counts out of the contract, so a tool nobody documented, a name
left behind by a rename, and a count that no longer matches all fail the build.

## What this server owes its callers

The tool descriptions and the server instructions are the product, not
documentation of it. They are what the calling model reads to decide what to do,
and a behaviour change that leaves them stale has shipped a lie. Both are in the
contract for that reason.

Rules the surface holds to, each of which has a conformance case behind it:

- **A path argument is untrusted input.** It resolves, symlinks included, before
  the containment check, and is refused outside the workspace roots.
- **A write is guarded.** A read returns a content token; a write with a stale one
  is refused and the refusal carries the current token, so recovery is one step.
- **Nothing touches an application the user is running, unless asked to.** A run
  happens in an instance the server created, which is the only reason it can
  enforce a deadline by terminating it. The three office tools are the exception
  the user asked for, and they act on the one file named: a copy holding unsaved
  work is closed only with save_changes or discard_changes, an application is
  quit only if this server started it and nothing else is open in it, and a
  process is ended only with end_process, only the one Windows names as holding
  the file, and only if it is that file's own application.
- **Hard-to-undo things are the user's decision.** Deleting a module, overwriting
  cells that hold data, writing to a signed or password-protected project. Each
  of the last two is a refusal until the flag that allows it is passed: a
  warning after the write is not asking first.
- **No result is claimed that was not observed.** A cell write answers
  `recalculated: false`, because the file holds no result until Excel opens it.
  A read with `calculate` says who calculated (`calculated_by`) and names every
  cell the engine could not work out, with the reason, rather than passing its
  cached value off as fresh. An implementation that reported a computed value it
  did not compute would be lying to the user through the agent.

A refusal is as much of the contract as a success: 31 of the 143 conformance cases
assert a failure message. An error message is the whole of what the calling agent
has to work with, so each one names what was refused and what to do instead.

## Prose

Plain ASCII, no em dashes, no AI tells. This applies to tool descriptions and
error messages as much as to documentation, because an agent reads them and a
user reads what the agent repeats back.

## Releasing

The version lives in exactly one place, `python/src/xlide_mcp/_version.py`. The
packaging metadata, the server's `version` field and the generated contract all
read from it. Bump that line, regenerate the contract, tag `v*.*.*`.

A release title is the tag and nothing else. Commit subjects follow the
convention already in `git log`, not an older style still visible in it.

Pushing a `v*.*.*` tag builds the package, publishes it to PyPI through Trusted
Publishing and cuts the GitHub release. The workflow refuses a tag that does not
match `_version.py`, and refuses to publish at all if the generated contract is
out of date, because a release whose tool surface does not match its artifacts is
one every port would be verified against wrongly.

```bash
# from the repository root, with CHANGELOG.md written for the version
git tag v1.0.0 && git push origin v1.0.0
```

## Releases, CI and security

These rules are the same in every WilliamSmithEdward repository.

- **How a release happens here:** pushing a `vX.Y.Z` tag runs Publish, which uploads to PyPI and creates the GitHub release with its security and malware reports.
- **Starting a workflow by hand never releases anything.** Publish and every
  release report are dry runs when started with `gh workflow run` or the Run
  workflow button. They build, scan and assemble the release files exactly
  as a release would, and upload them as the `release-preview` artifact
  instead. Run one after changing anything on the release path:
  `gh workflow run <file> --ref main`, then
  `gh run download <run-id> -n release-preview`.
- **Do not create, publish, edit or delete a release or a `v*` tag** unless
  the owner asks for it. A `v*` tag cannot be moved or deleted once pushed.
- **Every change to `main` goes through a pull request** that passes CI
  passed, Security passed and Malware scan passed. No one can push to `main`
  directly or skip the checks, admins included. Push a branch, open a pull
  request, and let it merge itself: `gh pr merge --auto --squash <number>`.
- **Pins.** Actions by full commit SHA with the version as a comment. Images
  by digest, in `.github/security/<tool>/Dockerfile`. Python tools from the
  hash-locked `.github/requirements/<purpose>.txt`, compiled from the `.in`
  beside it with
  `uv pip compile <purpose>.in --universal --generate-hashes --python-version 3.12 -o <purpose>.txt`.
  Runners are named releases, never `-latest`.
- **Updates merge themselves.** Dependabot and the Update YARA rules workflow
  open pull requests that merge once the three checks pass, except a
  third-party major version, which waits for the owner. Leave them alone
  unless asked.
- **A scanner finding is fixed or accepted with a written reason** in the
  repository's accepted list. Never silence a scanner without one.
