## Service Layer Pattern

Each domain has a service in `internal/{domain}/` following the same shape:

```go
type Service struct {
    db *sql.DB
    q  *storage.Queries
}

func NewService(db *sql.DB, q *storage.Queries) *Service {
    return &Service{db: db, q: q}
}
```

Core data services:
- **event** - CRUD, search, export, recurrence-aware queries, soft-delete/restore/purge
- **todo** - CRUD, search, completion, soft-delete/restore/purge
- **journal** - CRUD, search, soft-delete/restore/purge
- **calendar** - CRUD, color management, remote-link metadata
- **alarm** - Check due alarms, fire, dismiss, snooze
- **recurrence** - Expand recurring events/todos/journals, handle overrides
- **trash** - Mixed soft-delete view across event/todo/journal (list, restore, purge)

Integration / infrastructure packages (these do NOT follow the `NewService`
shape above — constructors and wiring vary per package):
- **sync** - CalDAV sync engine, conflict detection and resolution (`NewService` with extra dependencies)
- **caldav** - Low-level CalDAV client (discovery, REPORT, PROPFIND, VFREEBUSY) — `NewClient`
- **freebusy** - Local free/busy computation plus remote CalDAV query — plain functions (`Compute`)
- **auth** - Credential storage (OS keyring, optional plaintext), OAuth2 PKCE — plain functions
- **maintenance** - Background purge loop for soft-deleted rows — `NewPurger`
- **notify** - Desktop notifications plus SMTP email for EMAIL alarms — plain functions (`Display`, `Audio`, `Email`)
- **retry** - HTTP retry/backoff helpers shared by sync and caldav — plain functions

Models live in `internal/{domain}/model.go` (e.g., `event.Event`) and shared models in `internal/model/` (e.g., `model.Alarm`, `model.Attendee`).

CLI commands live in `cmd/chroncal/`, one file per resource group. Each exports a `Command()` function returning a `*cobra.Command`. Commands use `resolveEvent()` / `resolveTodo()` / `resolveJournal()` helpers to resolve references by ID, UID, or UID+recurrenceID.

## Storage Layer

- Hand-written files in `internal/storage/`: `connect.go` (DB setup), `nullable.go` (helpers), `query_builder.go` (dynamic WHERE construction), `scan_helpers.go` (row scanners), `events_dynamic.go` and `todos_dynamic.go` (filtered query methods), `xprop_helpers.go` (alarm X-property attach/replace shared by event and todo services). Everything else is sqlc-generated and will be overwritten by `make generate`.
- The dynamic query files replace sqlc's `arg = '' OR column = arg` pattern with runtime WHERE clause construction so SQLite can use indexes. Queries use `SELECT *`, so if a migration adds columns to `events` or `todos`, only update the scan functions in `scan_helpers.go` to match.
- **Never edit `*.sql.go` files or `db.go` or `models.go` directly.**
- Add new queries to `db/queries/*.sql`, then run `make generate`.
- After schema changes: add a migration to `db/migrations/`, update queries, then regenerate.
- Transaction pattern: `q.WithTx(tx)` inside a transaction.

## Gotchas

### Database
- Case-insensitive Unicode search goes through FTS5 (`unicode61 remove_diacritics 2` tokenizer); see the `*_fts` virtual tables in `db/migrations/`. There is no custom `lower_unicode` SQLite function — a stale registration that no query referenced was removed. Do not reintroduce `strings.ToLower`-backed folding: it is simple case folding only and would not match the FTS tokenizer's diacritic-insensitive behavior.
- `backfillAlarmUIDs` in `connect.go` assigns UUIDs to alarms from the pre-UID schema. Runs on every startup, no-ops when all alarms have UIDs.
- SQLite pragmas set in `connect.go:Open()`: WAL mode, foreign keys ON, 5s busy timeout, synchronous=NORMAL.

### Recurrence
- Recurring events are stored as a single row with `recurrence_rule`.
- Overrides are separate rows with the same `uid` but a non-empty `recurrence_id`.
- EXDATEs and RDATEs are comma-separated RFC 3339 strings.
- Expansion happens at query time via `recurrence.ListExpandedEvents()`.
- Half-open time ranges everywhere: `[start, end)`.

### Alarms
- Triggers are RFC 5545 duration strings (`-PT15M` = 15 minutes before).
- Absolute triggers use RFC 3339.
- State is tracked in `alarm_state` / `todo_alarm_state` tables (fired_at, acknowledged_at, snooze_until).
- Alarms older than 24h are skipped (`alarm.StaleThreshold`).
- Repeat logic: additional firings at `Duration` intervals up to `Repeat` count.

### iCal Round-Trip
- UID is required for round-trip fidelity.
- `recurrence_id` distinguishes overridden instances.
- Transient fields (Alarms, Attendees, etc.) are populated for export but not stored in the main event/todo tables.
- Duration can be expressed as either DTEND or DURATION (RFC 5545).
- Timezones are preserved via the `timezone` column and the `timezones` table.

### Time Handling
- All database times are RFC 3339 strings in UTC.
- Go code uses `time.Time` with `time.UTC`.
- All-day events have time component 00:00:00.

### TUI Buttons
- Exactly two variants: `Button` (neutral default) and `ButtonDanger`
  (destructive). No Primary, no Secondary, no Ghost.
- `ButtonDanger` at rest shares the same pill and background as
  `Button`; only the *label* is bold red (`Theme.Error`). On focus
  Danger inverts (red bg, contrasting fg) instead of using
  `FormHighlight` — needed because some themes have a warm/red focus
  highlight that makes red text on it unreadable. Putting the red on
  the background and computing a contrasting label via
  `oklch.ContrastingFg` guarantees legibility on every theme and
  emphasizes the destructive signal exactly when the user is about to
  commit.
- Color carries one signal: destructive or not. Focus highlight carries
  the other: which button Enter triggers. Do not conflate them.
- `Form.SetSubmitVariant` defaults to `Button`; only destructive prompts
  need to opt in via `ConfirmDialogModel.Destructive()`.
- For hand-rolled buttons that bypass `Form`, render via
  `ButtonStyles.Normal` (or `.Danger` for destructive). Don't reach for a
  "more prominent" style — there isn't one, by design.
- Confirm dialogs focus Cancel by default (`form.FocusCancel()`), so a
  reflex Enter cancels rather than confirms. Keep that behavior when
  building new destructive prompts.

## Common Tasks

### Find an event by ID or UID
```go
evt, err := svc.Get(ctx, id)                                        // numeric ID
evt, err := svc.GetByUID(ctx, uid)                                  // string UID
evt, err := svc.GetByUIDAndRecurrenceID(ctx, uid, recurrenceID)     // override instance
```

### Query events in date range
```go
from := time.Date(2026, 4, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, time.UTC)
to := time.Date(2026, 4, 30, 0, 0, 0, 0, time.UTC)
events, err := svc.ListByDateRange(ctx, from, to)
```

### Handle recurring events
```go
recurSvc := recurrence.NewService(db, q)
expanded, err := recurSvc.ListExpandedEvents(ctx, from, to)
// Each ExpandedEvent has: Event, InstanceTime, IsOverride
```

### Create an alarm
```go
alarm := model.Alarm{
    Action:       "DISPLAY",
    TriggerValue: "-PT15M",
    Description:  "Meeting reminder",
    Related:      "START",
}
err := evtSvc.ReplaceAlarms(ctx, eventID, []model.Alarm{alarm})
```

### Check due alarms
```go
alarmSvc := alarm.NewService(db, q, eventSvc, todoSvc)
dueEvents, dueTodos, err := alarmSvc.Check(ctx, time.Now())
// Each DueAlarm has: Event, Alarm, TriggerAt, StateID
```

### Import/Export iCal
```go
result, err := ical.ImportFile(r) // r is io.Reader
// result.Events, result.Todos, result.Timezones, result.Warnings

params := event.ExportParams{CalendarID: 1, From: "2026-04-01T00:00:00Z", To: "2026-04-30T23:59:59Z"}
events, err := svc.ExportFiltered(ctx, params)
ics, err := ical.ExportEvents(events, "Work")
ics, err := ical.ExportTodos(todos, "Work")
```

### Parse RFC 5545 duration
```go
err := duration.Validate("-PT15M")
newTime := duration.Add(time.Now(), "-PT15M")
durStr := duration.FromGo(15 * time.Minute)  // "PT15M"
```

### Soft-delete + restore + purge
Events, todos, and journals share the same reversible-delete contract.
`Delete` / `DeleteSeries` flip `deleted_at`; live reads gate on
`deleted_at IS NULL`. Each domain service owns its own restore / purge:

```go
// Soft-delete: the Delete methods already do this.
err := svc.Delete(ctx, id)        // sets deleted_at, keeps row
err := svc.DeleteSeries(ctx, uid) // soft-deletes master + overrides

// Restore:
err := svc.RestoreByID(ctx, id)    // un-hides one row
err := svc.RestoreByUID(ctx, uid)  // un-hides master + all overrides
// Returns svc.ErrNotDeleted when the row is live or missing.

// Purge (hard-delete soft-deleted rows):
err := svc.PurgeByID(ctx, id)         // one row, refuses live rows
n, err := svc.PurgeDeleted(ctx, cutoff) // all rows older than cutoff
```

Restoring a recurring override also clears the matching EXDATE on the
master in the same transaction, so expansion sees the occurrence again.
The EXDATE-provenance rule (only strip EXDATEs a delete recorded, never
imported ones — issue #86) lives in `softdelete.ClearMasterEXDATE`; each
domain's `clearMasterEXDATE` is a thin wrapper that binds its sqlc queries
to that shared helper. Fix the contract there, not per-domain.

### List or purge mixed trash
The `internal/trash` package aggregates all three domains:

```go
trashSvc := trash.NewService(a.Events, a.Todos, a.Journals)
entries, err := trashSvc.List(ctx, calendarID) // newest-first, all kinds
err = trashSvc.Restore(ctx, entries[0])
err = trashSvc.Purge(ctx, entries[0])
counts, err := trashSvc.PurgeOld(ctx, time.Now().Add(-30*24*time.Hour))
```

`Entry.Kind` (KindEvent, KindEventInstance, KindEventSeriesTail,
KindTodo, KindJournal) tells the caller which fields are populated.

## AI-assisted contributions

Follow the [Linux kernel AI coding assistant
guidelines](https://docs.kernel.org/process/coding-assistants.html) for any
AI-assisted commit in this repo.

- The human contributor is the sole git author. AI tools are not authors and
  must not appear in `Co-authored-by` trailers.
- AI agents must **not** add `Signed-off-by` tags.
- When AI assistance materially shaped a commit, add an `Assisted-by` trailer
  to the commit message body (not the author field):

  ```
  Assisted-by: AGENT_NAME:MODEL_VERSION [TOOL1] [TOOL2]
  ```

  Use the actual agent framework and model version (e.g.
  `Assisted-by: Cursor:gpt-5.3-codex`). List only specialized analysis tools
  in brackets — not git, editors, gcc, or make.
- Do not use `Co-developed-by` or `Co-authored-by` for AI attribution.
- Use `git commit-tree` (or amend with a message file) when the environment
  would otherwise inject `Co-authored-by: Cursor <cursoragent@cursor.com>`.

## Skill routing

When the user's request matches an available skill, ALWAYS invoke it using the Skill
tool as your FIRST action. Do NOT answer directly, do NOT use other tools first.
The skill has specialized workflows that produce better results than ad-hoc answers.

Key routing rules:
- Product ideas, "is this worth building", brainstorming → invoke office-hours
- Bugs, errors, "why is this broken", 500 errors → invoke investigate
- Ship, deploy, push, create PR → invoke ship
- QA, test the site, find bugs → invoke qa
- Code review, check my diff → invoke review
- Update docs after shipping → invoke document-release
- Weekly retro → invoke retro
- Design system, brand → invoke design-consultation
- Visual audit, design polish → invoke design-review
- Architecture review → invoke plan-eng-review
