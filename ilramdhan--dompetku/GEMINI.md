## Architecture rules
- All DB access goes through server code with the service-role client in `src/lib/db.server.ts`; RLS is on with no policies — the browser never talks to Supabase directly (single-user app, keeps data private).
- Auth is a single env-defined user (APP_USERNAME/APP_PASSWORD) with an HMAC-signed httpOnly cookie; every data server fn uses `requireAuth` middleware.
- External automation (n8n bots/reminders) uses `/api/public/n8n/*` routes guarded by `N8N_API_KEY`; keep business logic in `finance.server.ts` so web and bot share it.
- Schema lives in `supabase/schema.sql` (user runs it on their own Supabase); update it whenever tables change.
- Vercel builds switch nitro preset via the VERCEL env in vite.config.ts, so the same code runs on Lovable and Vercel.
- AI (OCR/text parsing) uses an OpenAI-compatible endpoint configured by AI_API_URL/AI_API_KEY/AI_MODEL for portability.
- Receipt photos live in a private Supabase Storage bucket `receipts`, lazy-created by `src/lib/receipt.server.ts`; transactions store only `receipt_path`, and viewing goes through short-lived signed URLs.
- Dark mode is a `.dark` class on `<html>` set by an inline script in `__root.tsx` (localStorage `dk-theme`); all colors must stay semantic tokens so both themes work.
- Pure, client-safe parsing/formatting (CSV import preview, reminder email builder) lives in `src/lib/csv.ts` / `src/lib/email.ts` so it is unit-testable and shared.
- Direct reminder email uses Resend over fetch (RESEND_API_KEY/EMAIL_FROM/EMAIL_TO, optional); n8n can instead consume the ready-made email payload endpoints.
- Language switch (ID/EN) goes through `LanguageProvider`/`useI18n` in `src/lib/i18n.tsx`; dictionary keys are the original Indonesian strings, `t()` returns the input unchanged for id — wrap all new UI text in `t(...)` and register new keys in the dictionary.
- PWA is manifest-only (public/manifest.webmanifest + public/icons, favicon.png referenced from `__root.tsx`); no service worker is used, keep it that way so previews stay safe.
- Reads of optional tables (activity_log, gold_*, receivables*) go through `isMissingTable()` and degrade to empty/`{ready:false}` so pages never crash before the user runs a new schema section.
- Gold prices (world XAU + Antam) live in `src/lib/assets.server.ts`, cached one row per day per source in `gold_prices` with last-cache then estimate fallback; pure gold/receivable math lives in `src/lib/assets.ts`.
- Linked receivables move money as expense/income transactions in category "Piutang"; net worth adds outstanding linked receivables and gold value back so they count as assets.
- After CRUD, invalidate via `invalidateFor(qc, table)` (table→query-key map in queries.ts), never a blanket `invalidateQueries()`.
- Activity labels come from `src/lib/activity.ts`; action names are `<table>.<create|update|delete>` or the special keys listed there.
- Fees: transfer/top-up/monthly account fees are separate expense transactions in category "Biaya Admin"; monthly fees are applied lazily (dashboard/reminders) and deduplicated by a notes marker from `src/lib/fees.ts` (pure, tested). Optional v4 columns are dropped and retried in saveRow when missing.
- Unbounded history screens use validated server-side pagination and sorting; compact dashboard widgets and small form reference lists stay bounded or fully loaded for usability.
- Gold records with an account create a linked expense (buy) / income (sell) transaction in category "Emas" via `saveGold` in assets.server.ts (pure helpers in assets.ts); edits sync and deletes remove it, and net worth counts gold value once against the cash outflow.
- Telegram bot logic lives in the web app, not n8n: pure parsing/UI (slash commands, quickParse, periods, inline keyboards, callback parsing) in `src/lib/bot.ts` (tested), DB work in `src/lib/bot.server.ts`; n8n only forwards updates to `POST /api/public/n8n/bot` and relays `{method,text,reply_markup}` to the Telegram Bot API. `BOT_ALLOWED_CHAT_IDS` is required and fails closed: an empty list refuses every chat before any DB access and replies with the chat_id to add.
- Bot transactions are always previewed as `bot_drafts` rows and saved on ✅ via `createFromExternal` with `external_id = draft:<id>` (unique index) so retries/double taps are idempotent; AI output is snapped onto existing categories/accounts by `matchCategory` and never creates categories.
- Token budget: chat goes quickParse → keyword/history category → AI only when ambiguous (`BOT_TEXT_AI`); `AI_MODEL_TEXT` can point chat parsing at a cheaper model than OCR.
- Report aggregation runs in v9 Postgres functions (`dk_*`, service_role only) called from `src/lib/aggregate.ts` helpers; when `isMissingFunction()` matches, fall back to the JS sums in aggregate.ts (same results).
- `db()` is typed with `src/lib/database.types.ts` (regenerate via `SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID=… npm run gen:types`); add new tables/optional columns there (optional where the schema section may not be run).
- Recurring transactions (v10): pure scheduling in `recurring.ts`, `applyRecurring()` in `recurring.server.ts` runs lazily once next to `applyMonthlyFees()` (dashboard/reminders/bot), idempotent via notes marker + `external_id`, and never throws.
- Budgets (v11): rollover math and 80/100% threshold crossing are pure in `budget.ts`; `budgetAlertsFor()` (budget.server.ts) runs after web/bot saves, dedupes per month via `budget_alerts`, and never fails a save.
- Split transactions (v12) are N ordinary expense rows sharing `split_group` (aggregates/budgets need no changes); save/delete via `split.server.ts`, photos removed only when no other row references them (`removeOrphanPhotos`).
- Receipts (v12): up to 5 photos in `receipt_paths` with `receipt_path` = first for compatibility (`receipts.ts`); `items_search` is a GENERATED column — never write it (restore strips it via `GENERATED_COLUMNS`).
- Account report & reconciliation (v13): pure math in `account-report.ts`, `dk_account_monthly` SQL with JS fallback in `account-report.server.ts`; history in optional `account_reconciliations`.
- Login 2FA: optional TOTP (`APP_TOTP_SECRET`), pure helpers in `totp.ts`, verification in `totp.server.ts`; empty secret = password-only login.
- Backup/restore: export in `exportBackup()`, pure validation/FK order/remap in `backup.ts` (RESTORE_TABLES), chunked upserts in `backup.server.ts`; add every new table there in FK order (missing tables are skipped).
- Server errors go through `logError()` (`monitoring.server.ts`, pure helpers in `monitoring.ts`): one JSON log line plus optional Sentry envelope via `SENTRY_DSN`; it never throws.
- Fonts are self-hosted in `public/fonts` (@font-face in styles.css, preloaded in `__root.tsx`); Recharts is only imported through lazy wrappers in `src/components/charts`.
- CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs lint, typecheck, test and build on PRs and pushes to main; keep all four green.
- Privacy mode: store in `src/lib/privacy.ts` (localStorage `dk-privacy`, `.privacy` on `<html>` set pre-paint by the `__root.tsx` inline script, synced after hydration by `PrivacySync`); `money()`/`compact()` return a fixed-length mask when on, so any component rendering amounts must call `usePrivacy()` to re-render on toggle (charts included); use `{ reveal: true }` only in form/editing previews, `secret()` for non-money sensitive values (gold grams), `.num-sensitive` blur as a fallback. Percentages/counts stay visible; bot, exports and login are never masked.
- Logo & app settings (v14): brand mark is hand-written `public/logo.svg` (+ `logo-mono.svg`); PNG icons/og-image are rendered by dev-only `scripts/render-icons.mjs` (Playwright) — re-run it after changing the SVG. `app_settings` is one row (id = 1); `getAppSettings()` (app-settings.server.ts) caches ~60 s and merges over env (APP_TIMEZONE, BOT_DEFAULT_ACCOUNT) so a missing table changes nothing; pure defaults/validation in `app-settings.ts`. The logo is a ≤200 KB raster data URL (no SVG) served by public `/api/public/app-icon`; only `brandingOf()` fields are public (`getPublicBranding`), full read/write is requireAuth. The manifest stays static; favicon/title follow Settings client-side via `BrandingSync`. `base_currency` is a display preference only (aggregates stay in IDR).
- App version: `__APP_VERSION__`/`__APP_COMMIT__`/`__APP_BUILD_DATE__` are build-time `define`s from vite.config.ts (package.json version + Vercel/git SHA, declared in `src/version.d.ts`); read them only via `src/lib/version.ts` (pure, tested, safe fallbacks). Update check is the public `getLatestRelease` (version.server.ts, GitHub API, 3 s timeout, 6 h memory cache, null on failure); UI uses `<VersionBadge variant>` from `src/components/version-badge.tsx`.
- Public demo (`DEMO_MODE=true`, separate deployment + throwaway Supabase): pure helpers in `demo.ts` (tested), guards in `demo.server.ts` — `assertNotDemo()` on AI/OCR, uploads, CSV import, restore, app settings, TOTP enrolment; `assertDemoCapacity(table)` before inserts (saveRow, insertTransaction, split, receivables, reconciliations); n8n routes 403 via `checkApiKey`; per-IP write rate limit in `start.ts`. All are no-ops when the flag is off. Public `getDemoInfo` exposes credentials only in demo; UI reads it via `useIsDemo()`/`DemoGate`/`DemoDisabled` (`components/demo.tsx`). Daily reset is `.github/workflows/demo-reset.yml` → `seed-demo.mjs --reset --allow-remote` (needs `DEMO_RESET_CONFIRM=yes`). `PUBLIC_DEMO_URL` (env, via `brandingOf().demo_url`) shows "Coba demo" on the landing page; never hardcode the demo domain in app code.
- Scrolling: html/body use `overflow-x: clip` (with `hidden` fallback) so `position: sticky` works; smooth scroll is app-wide CSS under `prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference`, while router scroll restoration stays `instant`. The mobile header collapses its brand/tool row (`inert`) once scrolled so the nav pills stay pinned; `<BackToTop>` (`components/back-to-top.tsx`, hook in `hooks/use-scrolled-past.ts`) is rendered by both AppShell and LandingShell.
- Small fully-loaded entity lists (debts, goals, subscriptions, recurring, reminders) paginate client-side via `useClientPage` (`hooks/use-client-page.ts`, pure `clampOffset`/`pageSlice` in `paginate.ts`); summaries stay computed from the full list. `<Pagination>` scrolls the list top into view on page change.
- Dashboard "Rasio terhadap pemasukan" uses pure `incomeRatios()` in `src/lib/ratio.ts` (tested) over the existing `byCategory`; leftover = income − expense (goal deposits are transfers). Stat cards share a label/value/footer layout with month-over-month deltas from `d.trend`.
