# Cato Terraform Provider — Agent Guide

## Project Overview
This repository builds the Terraform provider for Cato Networks, published as
`registry.terraform.io/catonetworks/cato`. It is a Go module using HashiCorp's
Terraform Plugin Framework and the Cato Go SDK from `github.com/catonetworks/cato-go-sdk` to be able to call Cato public APIs.

## Architecture
- Each Terraform resource has a full CRUD implementation.
- The top-level Terraform model for a resource is defined in `type_*.go` with
  strongly-typed fields. Nested objects are mapped via framework attribute types
  (`attrTypes` maps / `ObjectAsOptions`), not plain Go structs - exception here are well defined shared types, e.g. GroupMembers in `type_group.go`. 
- Read, Create, and Update implementations share state-mapping logic. For complex resources  extracted into `hydrate_<name>_state.go` (API response → Terraform state) and `hydrate_<name>_api.go` (Terraform state → API input). Simple resources may map API responses through resource-local helpers.

## Structure
- `main.go` — provider entry point, wires `internal/provider.New(version)`.
- `internal/provider/` — provider config, resources, data sources, shared types,
  validators, plan modifiers, hydration helpers, and generated mocks.
  - `resource_*.go` — resource CRUD implementations
  - `resource_*_test.go` — unit test for resource implementations
  - `datasource_*.go` — data source read implementations
  - `datasource_*_test.go` — data source for resource implementations
  - `type_*.go` — Terraform schema model types
  - `hydrate_*_api.go` / `hydrate_*_state.go` — shared conversion helpers
  - `planmodifiers/` — custom plan modifier implementations
  - `validators/` — custom attribute validators
  - `mocks/` — mockery-generated mocks (do not edit manually)
- `internal/acctests/` — acceptance tests that call real Cato APIs.
- `internal/accmock/` and `test_data/` — mocked API integration tests.
- `examples/` — Terraform examples per resource and data source.
- `templates/` — provider documentation templates (used by `tfplugindocs`).
- `docs/` - generated provider docs output

## Setup
- Go `1.26.3` (see `go.mod`).
- Terraform CLI for running examples and acceptance tests.
- Required env vars for API access: `CATO_BASEURL`, `CATO_TOKEN`, provider
  `account_id`. Examples also accept `TF_VAR_token` / `TF_VAR_account_id`.
- Optional retry tuning: `CATO_RETRY_MAX`, `CATO_RETRY_WAIT_MIN_SECONDS`,
  `CATO_RETRY_WAIT_MAX_SECONDS`.

## Agentic loop for implementing changes
- Start with unit tests for behavioral changes; get user sign-off if requested.
- After implementation, iterate on unit tests until green, then add/update acceptance tests when API behavior changed, run lint and vulnerability check, update docs and examples. Don't run the acceptance tests in this loop unless specifically asked.

## Definition of Done for agentic loop
- Change is implemented with clear, maintainable code that follows existing patterns in internal/provider/.
- Unit tests are added/updated for the behavior change and pass (make test).
- Acceptance tests are added/updated when real API behavior changed.
- Imports and style checks pass (make sort-imports, make lint).
- Vulnerability check passes
- Documentation is updated and generated (make docs) to reflect the final behavior.
- Example configuration in examples/ is updated to match the implementation and docs.
- New/changed resources or data sources are registered in `internal/provider/provider.go`.
- No secrets, state files, debug logs, or manual edits to generated mocks are included.
- Scope is minimal and focused; no unrelated refactors or behavior changes.
- Final verification summary is provided to the user (what changed, tests run, any residual risks).

## Commands

```sh
make build          # compile terraform-provider-cato
make install        # build + install dev provider override (~/.terraformrc-dev)
make install-mirror # build + install filesystem mirror (needed for terraform test)
make test           # run unit tests (excludes acceptance tests)
make lint           # run golangci-lint (includes acctest build tag)
make sort-imports   # run goimports + gci on internal/
make docs           # regenerate provider docs with tfplugindocs
make mocks          # regenerate mockery mocks
make vul            # vulnerability check with govulncheck
make acctest        # run acceptance tests (real API — see Testing section)
```

Target a single package or test during development:

```sh
go test ./internal/provider/... -run TestName
```

## Testing

**Unit tests** live alongside the code in `internal/provider/`. They mock Cato
backend API calls and cover business logic and Terraform state mapping. Run with
`make test`.

**Acceptance tests** in `internal/acctests/` call real Cato APIs and create real
resources. Run with:

```sh
make acctest
```

Set `DISABLE_POLICY_RULE_CLEANUP=true` when running acceptance tests to prevent
the provider from discarding draft policy revisions during `Configure()` (already
included in `make acctest`).

## Import Ordering
Imports must follow the order enforced by `make sort-imports`:
1. Standard library
2. Third-party packages
3. `github.com/softopus-io/*` packages
4. Local module packages

Violating this order will cause `make lint` to fail.

## Adding a New Resource
1. `internal/provider/type_<name>.go` — define the Terraform model struct and schema.
2. `internal/provider/resource_<name>.go` — implement `Create`, `Read`, `Update`, `Delete`, `ImportState`.
3. `internal/provider/hydrate_<name>_api.go` — Terraform state → API input conversion (if non-trivial).
4. `internal/provider/hydrate_<name>_state.go` — API response → Terraform state conversion (if non-trivial).
5. Register in `internal/provider/provider.go` under `Resources()`.
6. Add `examples/resources/cato_<name>/resource.tf` — complete example using all available parameters; comment out optional ones.
7. Add `templates/resources/<name>.md.tmpl` if custom docs are needed; otherwise `tfplugindocs` generates them automatically.
8. Run `make docs` and `make sort-imports` before committing.

## Development Notes
- When bumping the provider version, update it in both `GNUmakefile` and `main.go` (the `version` variable).
- Use the same example from `examples/` in the corresponding `*.md`
- Make an example complete, self-explanatory and use maximum number of available parameters, comment out the optional ones (see example in `.agents/examples/example.tf`)

## Never
- Commit Terraform state files, API tokens, debug logs, or compiled provider binaries.
- Commit secrets or sensitive internal information.
- Edit files under `internal/provider/mocks/` by hand — regenerate with `make mocks`.

## Skills
Find all skills in `.agents/skills/`
- Use `prepare-release/SKILL.md` to prepare the release of a new version of the terraform provider
- Use `publish-release/SKILL.md` to publish the release of a new version of the terraform provider
- Use `cato-provider-unit-tests/SKILL.md` to prepare unit tests
- Use `integration-test-mock/SKILL.md` to prepare a mock of an integration test
