## Architecture and Design Patterns

### LLM Documentation Structure

The `/llm/` directory covers:

- **Tokenization** - BPE, SentencePiece, WordPiece, and subword algorithms
- **Transformer Architecture** - Attention mechanisms (MHA, GQA, MQA), positional encodings, and optimization
- **Training** - Pretraining, SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning), LoRA/QLoRA, RLHF, DPO
- **Inference** - KV cache optimization, quantization, continuous batching, vLLM/SGLang
- **RAG Systems** - Retrieval design, vector databases, reranking, query expansion
- **Agent Frameworks** - ReAct architecture, tool calling, skill systems, memory mechanisms
- **Memory Systems** - Short-term/long-term memory, retrieval strategies, evaluation metrics

### Document Creation Guidelines

When creating new documentation:

#### LLM Documentation (`/llm/`)
- Use sequential numbering: `001_{topic}.md`, `002_{topic}.md`, etc.
- Follow existing format in `/llm/` directory
- Each document should be self-contained with clear progression

#### LeetCode Solutions
- Use format: `{problem-number}.{problem-name}.md` (e.g., `1.两数之和.md`)
- Follow existing template structure in `leetcode/0.模板.md`
- Include complexity analysis and multiple approaches if applicable

## Code Style and Standards

- **Documentation** - Technical documents primarily use Chinese explanations
- **Code examples** - Python implementations with clear comments and complexity analysis
- **Math formulas** - LaTeX syntax for mathematical expressions
- **File naming** - Use appropriate patterns per directory (see above)
- **Content organization** - Clear structure with sections for introduction, technical details, and examples

### Common Development Tasks

```bash
# Start new LLM document
# - Follow sequential numbering: 001_{topic}.md, 002_{topic}.md, etc.
# - Add to /llm/ directory

# Add new LeetCode solution
# - Follow existing naming convention
# - Use template from leetcode/0.模板.md

# Search for implementation references
find . -name "*.py" -type f | xargs grep -l "self-attention" | head -5

# Check git status
git status
```

### LeetCode 5-Day Sprint - State Recovery

```bash
# Check current sprint progress
cat workspace/leetcode/coach/session-state.json | python3 -m json.tool

# View completed Q&A records
ls workspace/leetcode/coach/*.md

# Resume sprint from last session
# 1. Read session state
# 2. Check current problem in 5-day plan
grep -A 5 '"current_problem"' workspace/leetcode/coach/session-state.json
cat leetcode/hot100-sprint-plan.md | grep -A 10 "current_problem"

# Review today's problems
day=$(grep '"active_day"' workspace/leetcode/coach/session-state.json | cut -d: -f2 | tr -d ',' | xargs)
echo "Day $day Problems:"
grep -A 50 "### Day $day:" leetcode/hot100-sprint-plan.md | grep -E '^\| [0-9]+' | head -20
```

## Important Notes

- **Active Development** - `/llm/` directory contains structured documentation with sequential numbering
- **Knowledge Repository** - This is primarily documentation, not an executable software project (except subprojects)
- **Chinese Content** - Main documentation is in Chinese, targeting Chinese-speaking audience
- **Structured Organization** - LLM docs use sequential numbering (001, 002, etc.) for clear learning path
- **Subproject Independence** - Each subproject in `/docs/` has its own dependencies and build system

## Last Updated

- **Last Revision**: 2026-04-02
- **Current Focus**: Expanding `/llm/` with sequentially numbered documentation for structured learning path
- **Active Areas**: LLM training techniques (LoRA, QLoRA), inference optimization, agent systems, algorithm practice
- **Knowledge Graph**: Unified knowledge tracking system located at `.claude/skills/interview-master/memory/Rain/knowledge_graph.json`
