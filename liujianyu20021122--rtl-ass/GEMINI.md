# RTL-ASS Repository Instructions

## Mission

RTL-ASS is an open-source, vendor-neutral Codex skill that strengthens Codex for RTL engineering. Codex remains responsible for understanding the user's intent, planning, editing RTL, reasoning about failures, and choosing the final implementation. RTL-ASS supplies domain-specific guidance, deterministic open-source tool helpers, structured evidence, and a verified local knowledge layer.

Do not turn RTL-ASS into a separate RTL coding agent, an autonomous replacement for Codex, or a fixed end-to-end EDA pipeline.

## Product Boundaries

- Support Verilog and SystemVerilog RTL, testbenches, assertions, simulation debugging, waveform analysis, synthesis readiness, formal/equivalence checks, and STA when sufficient open inputs exist.
- Use only open-source RTL/EDA tools in product code and documented default workflows.
- Do not add Vivado, Quartus, VCS, Verdi, Questa, Xcelium, or other proprietary/vendor tools as dependencies or required backends.
- Do not call another LLM or create a hidden multi-agent coding service. Codex itself is the reasoning and coding engine.
- Tool helpers return evidence; they do not decide what RTL patch Codex must apply.
- Never claim STA closure without a real netlist, Liberty timing library, constraints, and an executed timing engine.
- Never claim waveform analysis without reading a real waveform or simulator event artifact.
- Treat SystemVerilog as a first-class language for synthesizable RTL, testbenches, assertions, interfaces, and packages.
- Maintain separate but linkable knowledge objects for design RTL, testbenches, assertions, reference models, fixtures, and verification results.

## Audit-First Engineering

- Auditability is a system property, not a final report. Every ingest, search result, lifecycle transition, and verification claim must be traceable to immutable inputs and an actor or tool action.
- Prefer a small set of explicit invariants and typed boundaries over scattered defensive checks.
- Do not accumulate sample-specific branches, hidden fallbacks, permissive exception swallowing, or duplicate parsers to make individual tests pass.
- When an invariant fails, return a structured error at the boundary. Do not continue with partially valid state.
- Centralize validation for record schemas, lifecycle transitions, namespaces, paths, licenses, and evidence status.
- Database mutations must be transactional. Audit records are append-only; corrections create new events instead of rewriting history.
- Database migrations must be explicit per source/target version, validate their structural preconditions, verify invariants before commit, and roll back all DDL/DML on failure. Never auto-guess a migration.
- Candidate verification must use the atomic `kb verify` workflow. Direct lifecycle transition to `verified` is forbidden.
- Hash raw evidence artifacts as well as source inputs, and recheck both before committing a verification gate.
- Validate each implementation slice before starting the next. Do not defer integration testing until the end.
- Add a regression test for every confirmed defect, but fix the responsible abstraction rather than only the observed input.
- Periodically audit dead code, duplicate concepts, obsolete compatibility paths, and unreferenced artifacts.

## Canonical Repository Layout

- `.agents/skills/rtl-ass/`: Codex skill entrypoint, progressive references, and thin helper launchers.
- `src/rtl_ass/`: deterministic Python implementation for knowledge indexing, project inspection, search, and evidence normalization.
- `schemas/`: stable JSON schemas for knowledge and run artifacts.
- `config/`: example configuration with safe local defaults.
- `tests/`: unit and integration tests; fixtures must be small and redistributable.
- `evals/`: behavioral evaluations comparing Codex with and without the skill.
- `docs/`: maintained architecture and contributor documentation.
- `research/`: research artifacts only; code under `research/upstream/` is not product source.

## Skill Authoring Rules

- Keep `SKILL.md` concise and discriminating. Put conditional RTL guidance in `references/` and load only what the current task needs.
- Assume Codex is already a strong general programmer. Include RTL-specific knowledge that changes decisions; omit generic coding advice.
- Preserve user-selected language, interface, latency, protocol, clock/reset behavior, and verification scope.
- Prefer minimal, reviewable RTL patches over whole-file rewrites during debugging.
- Require Codex to distinguish specification, testbench, RTL, constraints, and infrastructure hypotheses before attributing a failure.
- Treat compilation, simulation, waveform, formal, synthesis, and STA as distinct evidence classes.

## Knowledge Base Governance

- The knowledge base augments retrieval; it does not modify model weights.
- Keep project, user, organization, and built-in namespaces isolated.
- Every record must retain provenance, content hash, license status, verification status, and applicable tool versions when known.
- Use the lifecycle `raw -> analyzed -> candidate -> verified -> promoted -> deprecated`.
- Generated or imported RTL must not enter `verified` or `promoted` automatically.
- Promotion requires configured evidence gates and an explicit command or review action.
- Preserve failed fixes as negative evidence. Do not mix infrastructure failures with RTL repair knowledge.
- Retain non-passing runs through `kb observe` with explicit attribution. Only an executed `fail` explicitly attributed to the target may create `negative-for`; timeout, blocked, infrastructure, and unattributed results must not teach a target anti-pattern.
- Do not ingest secrets, private source code into a broader namespace, benchmark hidden answers, or code with incompatible/unknown redistribution terms.
- Imported GitHub content starts in a quarantined corpus namespace. Upstream popularity or upstream tests do not make it trusted.
- Keep original source and distilled knowledge separate. Distilled records link back to immutable upstream hashes and license metadata.
- RTL and TB records must declare their role. Link a testbench to the exact DUT revision, command, expected behavior, and observed outcome when available.
- Never index benchmark reference answers into a retrieval namespace used while evaluating on that benchmark.

## Implementation Standards

- Target Python 3.11 or newer and prefer the standard library for the core MVP.
- Use SQLite and FTS5 as the default local index. Optional vector backends must remain optional.
- Make CLI output deterministic and provide JSON output for Codex consumption.
- Store paths portably; do not embed this machine's absolute paths in product defaults.
- Use content hashes and transactional writes for mutable knowledge state.
- Validate untrusted paths and never execute ingested RTL as part of indexing.
- Keep database files, generated waveforms, reports, caches, and downloaded research repositories out of Git.

## Verification Requirements

- Run the relevant unit tests for every code change.
- Run `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v` for changes spanning the core package.
- Run the Skill Creator validator against `.agents/skills/rtl-ass` after changing the skill.
- Test observable behavior and artifact content, not wording-only assertions.
- If an optional EDA tool is unavailable, report `not_available` or `not_evaluated`; do not silently pass.
- Validate incrementally in this order when applicable: schema and unit invariants, database transaction tests, CLI contract tests, fixture integration tests, then realistic RTL/TB tool tests.
- Finish a milestone only when its acceptance criteria and audit checks pass; record the exact commands and gaps in `PLAN.md`.

## Open-Source and Contribution Rules

- Do not copy code from `research/upstream/` into product source without checking its license and recording attribution.
- Reimplement concepts behind a clean interface when license compatibility or provenance is unclear.
- New runtime dependencies require a concrete benefit, an open-source license, and documentation in the plan.
- Keep `PLAN.md` current when a milestone, architecture decision, or acceptance criterion changes.
- GitHub corpus acquisition requires a reproducible manifest with repository URL, revision, retrieval date, license finding, intended record roles, and ingestion status.
- Do not interpret corpus ingestion as permission to redistribute every upstream file. Publish only what licenses and project policy permit.

## Code Review Rules

- Flag any change that makes RTL-ASS generate or apply RTL without Codex review.
- Flag evidence artifacts that can report success without running the corresponding tool.
- Flag automatic knowledge promotion, cross-namespace leakage, missing provenance, or license loss.
- Flag proprietary-tool coupling and assumptions that hard-code a single clock, reset, top module, simulator, or technology library.
