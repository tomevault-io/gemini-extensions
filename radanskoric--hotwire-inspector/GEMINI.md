# Agents

This file contains critical context for any agent working on this project.

## Project Overview

This repository contains **Hotwire Inspector**, a cross-browser DevTools extension for inspecting Hotwire-related page structure, including Turbo Frames and Stimulus controllers.

Core tooling currently includes:

- WXT
- Vite
- Vitest
- Playwright
- ESLint
- Prettier
- Stylelint
- TypeScript (checkJs, JSDoc-only)

## Important Files and Areas

## Critical Project Expectations

- Do not mutate the target page DOM for tracking purposes.
- Preserve the current in-memory element identity approach unless there is a strong reason to change it. Always ask before making such changes.
- Prefer changes that keep the inspected page behavior as close to untouched runtime behavior as possible.
- Keep the extension cross-browser friendly.
- If you change central behavior in the content script or panel messaging, review the related E2E tests.

### Messaging architecture

The extension uses two messaging channels between the panel and the content script:

1. **One-shot relay** (panel → background → content script): the panel sends a `scan`, `highlight`, `unhighlight`, `inspect`, `watchValues`, or `unwatchValues` request via `browser.tabs.sendMessage` through the background relay. The content script responds via `browser.runtime.sendMessage`.
2. **Port-based event channel** (content script → background → panel): for live updates the content script opens a `ContentEventsPort` via `browser.runtime.connect` and pushes `ValuesChangedPush`, `TreeChangedPush`, or `TurboEventPush` messages.
   - `ValuesChangedPush` carries the current values of a watched controller.
   - `TreeChangedPush` is a lightweight signal that the inspected DOM may have changed and the panel should request a fresh scan. The background script also emits `TreeChangedPush` directly to the panel port when a tab finishes loading (`tabs.onUpdated` with `status === 'complete'`), so the tree refreshes after a reload or navigation. The content script listens to `pageshow` for back-forward-cache restores.
   - `TurboEventPush` carries `{ name, timestamp }` for each Turbo DOM event fired on the inspected page (see [Turbo Events capture](#turbo-events-capture) below).
     The background script routes every content-port message to the matching panel's `PanelEventsPort`. Ports provide `onDisconnect` lifecycle awareness for clean teardown.

### Turbo Events capture

- **What is captured**: a curated list of Turbo 8.x DOM events (`lib/turbo-event-watcher.js` exports `TURBO_EVENT_NAMES`). The list is the single source of truth — both the watcher and any tests that need to assert coverage import it from this module. Add a new event by adding a string to that array; nothing else needs to change.
- **What is read from each event**: only `event.type` (mapped to `name`) and `event.timeStamp` (mapped to `timestamp`, with a `Date.now()` fallback). The watcher is intentionally narrow — it never reads the event target, `detail`, or any payload, so capture is cheap and side-effect-free on the inspected page.
- **How capture is wired**: `TurboEventWatcher.start()` registers capture-phase (`useCapture: true`) listeners on `document` for each name in the list. `start()` is idempotent; calling it twice is a no-op. `stop()` removes exactly the listeners registered by `start()`. The class treats `document` opaquely — anything with `addEventListener`/`removeEventListener` (including a fake `EventTarget` in unit tests) works.
- **Capture is eager and ungated**: once the content script starts up, the watcher is running for the lifetime of the content script. There is no `watchTurboEvents`/`unwatchTurboEvents` one-shot handshake. This is a deliberate design choice — gating is a future optimization, not a v1 requirement. If you add a handshake, also wire matching cleanup in `ContentInspector.disconnect()`.
- **Push shape**: `{ type: TURBO_EVENT_PUSH_TYPE, name, timestamp }`. `TURBO_EVENT_PUSH_TYPE` lives in `lib/constants.js`; the `TurboEventPush` typedef lives in `lib/types.js`. The push rides the existing content→background→panel port pipeline — no background changes are needed.
- **Panel-side subscription**: `TurboEventsController.connect()` calls `PanelBridge.onTurboEvent(callback)`; the callback drives `addEvent(name)`, which appends one `.event-box`, trims to the cap, increments the dropped-count, and triggers smart autoscroll. The controller's `disconnect()` calls `PanelBridge.offTurboEvent()` to drop further push traffic — without this, a `TURBO_EVENT_PUSH_TYPE` arriving while the controller is between disconnect and reconnect would render into a torn-down subtree.
- **Rendering**: the cap (default 500), the dropped-count notice, the empty-state placeholder, and smart autoscroll all live in `lib/panel/controllers/turbo-events-controller.js`. The Stimulus target lifecycle (`eventTargetConnected`) is the single bookkeeping entry point — do not split trim/drop/autoscroll into separate hooks.

## Technical Decisions

Important decisions are documented in `docs/decisions/`.

At minimum, review those files when your work touches:

- extension tooling and build strategy
- DOM interaction strategy
- element identity or lookup behavior
- architectural decisions that may affect safety or debugging behavior

## Verification Expectations

When making meaningful changes, use the existing checks as appropriate:

- `npm run lint`
- `npm run lint:css`
- `npm run format:check`
- `npm run typecheck`
- `npm test -- --run`
- `npm run test:e2e`
- `npm run build`

## Common Gotchas

- `npm run dev:firefox` targets Firefox MV3 and uses WXT's dev server. The default dev server port is `3000`; if another process is already using that port, Firefox may open but the extension can fail to load or run properly. Set `WXT_DEV_SERVER_PORT` to a free port before starting the dev server, e.g. `WXT_DEV_SERVER_PORT=3001 npm run dev:firefox`.

## E2E Testing

The Chromium E2E tests use Playwright with a real extension loaded into the browser. They are split into two files with different strategies:

### Content-script tests (`content-script.spec.js`)

These do **not** interact with the DevTools panel UI directly because Playwright's bundled Chromium does not render extension DevTools panels (the `chrome.devtools.panels.create` API succeeds but the panel tab/iframe never appears).

Instead, the tests verify the full content-script pipeline by messaging through the extension's devtools frame:

1. Launch Chromium with `--auto-open-devtools-for-tabs` and the extension loaded
2. Find the DevTools page and locate the extension's `devtools.html` iframe
3. Use `chrome.devtools.inspectedWindow.tabId` and `chrome.tabs.sendMessage()` from that frame to send messages to the content script
4. Assert on the content script responses and on page-side effects (e.g. highlight styles)

### Panel UI tests (`panel.spec.js`)

These test the panel rendering by loading `panel.html` directly as a `chrome-extension://` page:

1. Launch Chromium with the extension loaded
2. Extract the extension ID from the devtools frame URL
3. Use `page.addInitScript()` to inject mock extension APIs before `main.js` runs
4. Navigate to `chrome-extension://<id>/panel.html` — `PanelApp` constructs against the mock and renders
5. Assert on the rendered DOM (tree nodes, badges, summary text, empty/error states)

The mock `browser.tabs.sendMessage` is configured per-test to return controlled scan data, reject to simulate errors, or return different responses on successive calls (for refresh tests).

### Key infrastructure details

- `PW_CHROMIUM_ATTACH_TO_OTHER=1` enables Playwright to attach to the DevTools page
- `ignoreDefaultArgs: ['--disable-extensions']` prevents Playwright from disabling extensions
- `Xvfb` is auto-started on Linux when no `DISPLAY` is set (needed for headed Chromium in containers)
- `workers: 1` in the Playwright config — multiple headed Chromium instances on a shared Xvfb display cause race conditions
- `about:blank` does not have a content script, so messaging rejects — this is tested with `.rejects.toThrow()`
- CSS shorthand properties (e.g. `outline`) are serialized differently across browsers — test individual sub-properties instead
- Chrome (`channel: 'chrome'`) is not available on Linux ARM64 via Playwright; the tests use bundled Chromium

If you change content script message types, the devtools entrypoint, or the panel rendering logic, update the corresponding E2E tests.

## Working Style

- Always use red/green TDD for behavior changes.
- Keep unit-tested application logic at 100% coverage across statements, branches, functions, and lines; do not reduce coverage for functions in `lib/**/*.js`.
- Keep JSDoc type annotations accurate when changing `lib/**` or messaging shapes; `npm run typecheck` must stay green.
- Type checking (`checkJs` via `jsconfig.json`) currently covers `lib/**`, `entrypoints/**`, and `scripts/**`; `tests/**` is intentionally out of scope until its files are annotated (ratchet candidate).
- Prefer minimal, targeted changes.
- Avoid introducing side effects in inspected pages.
- Treat `docs/decisions/` as the authoritative record for architectural choices unless intentionally updating those decisions.
