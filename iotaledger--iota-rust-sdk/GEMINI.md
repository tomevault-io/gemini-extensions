# AGENTS.md

This file provides context for AI agents working with the IOTA Rust SDK repository.

## Project Overview

The **IOTA Rust SDK** is a modular software development kit for integrating with the IOTA blockchain. IOTA is a next-generation smart contract platform powered by Move.

**Key Design Goals:**

- Modularity: Users only pay for features they use
- Lightweight: Minimal dependency footprint
- WASM Support: Libraries usable in browser environments
- Multi-language: FFI bindings for Go, Kotlin, Python, C#, Swift (via `uniffi`)

## Critical development notes

1. **NEVER make breaking changes** — this SDK is consumed externally. New fields must be optional, removals require a deprecation step first.
2. **NEVER disable or skip tests** — all tests must pass and stay enabled.
3. **NEVER use `#[allow(dead_code)]`, `#[allow(unused)]`, or other lint suppressions** to silence warnings — fix the underlying issue.
4. **Types in `iota-sdk-types` must stay BCS-compatible** — verify BCS and JSON round-trips when adding or changing a type. `u64` is serialized as a string in JSON for JS safety.
5. **Format and lint after every change** — `cargo +nightly fmt`, `dprint fmt`, and `make bindings-examples-format-check` for binding examples.
6. **Keep pull requests small** — prefer small, focused PRs over large ones. A small diff is easier to review, easier to revert, and less likely to introduce regressions.
7. **Split work into multiple PRs when possible** — if a change spans multiple concerns (e.g. a refactor plus a new feature, or changes across unrelated crates), split it into separate PRs. Land independent pieces incrementally rather than bundling them together. **Critically: when given multiple GitHub issues, ALWAYS create one PR per issue** — never bundle multiple issues into a single PR unless explicitly instructed or the issues are genuinely interdependent.
8. **Write only what the diff can't say** — PR descriptions, review comments and chat replies cover the reasoning and the high-level shape of a change, never a walkthrough of the diff. See [Writing style](#writing-style); this is the most frequently ignored rule in this file.
9. **Feature flags matter** — the umbrella `iota-sdk` gates everything behind features. Check what's enabled for the code you're modifying before assuming an item exists.
10. **NEVER hand-edit generated gRPC types** under `crates/iota-sdk-grpc-types/src/proto/` — they are build output. Changes go into the proto sources / `update_grpc_types.sh`.

```

The `iota-sdk` umbrella crate exposes the other crates via modules gated by feature flags: `crypto`, `graphql` (→ `graphql_client`), `grpc` (→ `grpc_client` + `grpc_types`), `move-types` (→ `move_types`), `txn-builder` (→ `transaction_builder`), and `types`. `grpc` and `move-types` are opt-in (not in `default`); `graphql`, `crypto`, `types`, `txn-builder` are on by default.

## Code Conventions

- **Edition**: 2024
- **Formatting**: Nightly rustfmt (config in `rustfmt.toml`)
- **Linting**: Clippy with warnings as errors (`-Dwarnings`)
- **Naming**: crates `iota-sdk-*`, modules `snake_case`, types `PascalCase`, constants `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
- **Errors**: `thiserror` enums, `#[non_exhaustive]` at the type level
- **Feature gating**: optional functionality lives behind features; APIs use `#[cfg(feature = "…")]` and `#[cfg_attr(doc_cfg, doc(cfg(feature = "…")))]` for docs.rs visibility
- **Comments**: see [Writing style](#writing-style) below

## Writing style

All prose — PR/issue descriptions, reviews, chat replies, comments, commit messages:

- One sentence naming the change, then only what the reader can't get from the diff: the problem, the reasoning, real trade-offs. Default budget: 1–3 sentences per section — spend more only on a concern the reader would miss, never to cover the diff more completely.
- No diff inventory — no per-file bullets, no symbol lists, no restating code in prose. Applies to reasons too: a "why" whose content is visible in the diff is inventory.
- No invented motives — never "X because Y" unless Y came from the issue or task.
- No filler — no lead-ins, headings-for-show, verdict paragraphs, or notes about these rules. Reviews: start with the first finding, one point per comment.
- Plain language — only terms already in the codebase or domain; never coin a label and reuse it as vocabulary.
- Match the answer's shape to the question — an enumerable question gets a bullet list, one line per item; prose only where an item needs actual reasoning.

Before posting: delete every sentence the reader could get from the diff; repeat until a pass cuts nothing.

## Git Workflow

- **Main branch**: `develop` (not `main`)
- **CI**: All tests must pass, no clippy warnings, proper formatting
- Draft PRs can force CI with `[run-ci]` in the PR body
- **PR title format**: Titles are validated in CI (`.github/workflows/pr_title.yml`) and must follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) style. Allowed types are `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `chore`, `upstream`, and `release` (e.g. `feat: add new gRPC method`, `chore: update docs`). No other prefixes (such as `docs:` or `test:`) are accepted — use `chore:` for those.

## WASM Considerations

The `make wasm32` target checks that the following crates compile to `wasm32-unknown-unknown`: `iota-sdk`, `iota-sdk-crypto`, `iota-sdk-graphql-client`, `iota-sdk-transaction-builder`, and `iota-sdk-types`. The full WASM/TypeScript bindings package (which also builds `iota-sdk-ffi` for wasm32) is built with `make wasm`. The gRPC client/types are not built for WASM. When adding dependencies to any of the WASM-built crates:

- Ensure they support `wasm32-unknown-unknown`
- Use `getrandom` with the `js` / `wasm_js` feature for randomness
- Avoid OS-specific functionality
- Run `make wasm32` after changes to verify the SDK crates still build for `wasm32-unknown-unknown`
