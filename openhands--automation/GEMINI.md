## Cross-Repo Coordination

Three repos work together:

| Repo | Branch | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| `OpenHands/automation` | `dispatch-phase1b` | Automation service (this repo) |
| `OpenHands/deploy` (aka `All-Hands-AI/deploy`) | `dispatch-phase1b` | Deploys automation as a sidecar |
| `OpenHands/software-agent-sdk` | `feat/saas-runtime-mode` | SDK changes for in-sandbox execution |

**AUTOMATION_SHA linking**: The deploy repo references a specific automation commit in two workflow files:
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yaml` → `AUTOMATION_SHA: "<full-sha>"`
- `.github/workflows/deploy-automation.yaml` → `AUTOMATION_SHA: "<full-sha>"`

After pushing to the automation repo, update both files in the deploy repo.

## Configuration

Configuration is centralized in `config.py` using a composed `AppConfig` with typed sections:

```python
from automation.config import get_config

config = get_config()
config.service.db_host          # ServiceSettings (AUTOMATION_ prefix)
config.storage.file_store       # StorageSettings (no prefix, SDK conventions)
config.http.auth_cache_ttl      # HttpSettings (AUTOMATION_ prefix)
config.sandbox.max_run_duration # SandboxSettings (AUTOMATION_ prefix)
config.kv.kv_secret             # KVSettings (AUTOMATION_ prefix)
config.log.log_level            # LogSettings (no prefix)
```

**Key principles:**
- Use `get_config().<section>` instead of deprecated `get_settings()`
- All environment variables documented in config class docstrings
- Protocol constants (WORK_DIR, TARBALL_PATH) in `constants.py` - these cannot be changed without breaking compatibility
- Shared logging context via `log_extra()` from `automation.utils`

## Build & Test Commands

```bash
# Pre-commit (run from repo root)
pre-commit run --files openhands/**/*.py scripts/**/*.py tests/**/*.py --show-diff-on-failure

# Unit tests (no external deps, skips Docker-dependent tests)
uv run pytest tests/ -v --ignore=tests/integration

# Integration test (requires OPENHANDS_API_KEY)
OPENHANDS_API_KEY=sk-oh-... uv run pytest tests/integration/ -v

# E2E test script (live sandbox, ~80s)
OPENHANDS_API_KEY=sk-oh-... uv run python scripts/test_automation.py --api-url https://staging.all-hands.dev
```

## Product Telemetry Identity

- Cloud product events use the server-authoritative Cloud user ID as the PostHog `distinct_id`; never trust a client telemetry header as Cloud identity.
- Local Agent Canvas requests carry their consented PostHog identity in `X-OpenHands-Telemetry-Distinct-Id`. Store that value on newly created automations and runs so asynchronous lifecycle events retain the same identity.
- Local events with no Canvas attribution fall back to the DB-backed automation backend ID. Keep `automation_backend_id` as an event property for installation analysis rather than substituting it for a known person identity.
- Local consent is stored per frontend distinct ID. Attributed events require consent for their resolved identity; only unattributed backend-level events use the aggregate installation consent.

## PR-Specific Documents

When working on a PR that requires design documents, live-test logs, development-only scripts, or other temporary artifacts that should **not** be merged to `main`, store them in a `.pr/` directory at the repository root.

```bash
mkdir -p .pr

.pr/
├── design.md       # Design decisions and architecture notes
├── analysis.md     # Investigation or debugging notes
└── notes.md        # Any other PR-specific content
```

The `PR Artifacts` workflow warns reviewers when `.pr/` exists on a PR and automatically removes the directory with a follow-up commit when a same-repo PR is approved. Fork PRs must remove `.pr/` manually before merge.

Important notes:

- Do not put anything in `.pr/` that needs to be preserved.
- The `.pr/` check is informational during development; it posts a notice rather than blocking the PR.
- For fork PRs, remove `.pr/` manually before merging.


## Dispatch Pipeline

The dispatcher uses a **fire-and-forget** model. For each PENDING run:

1. **Fetch per-user API key** — `get_api_key_for_automation_run()` mints a key via the service key
2. **Resolve tarball** — Internal (`oh-internal://`) downloads from GCS; external (HTTP) URLs are downloaded inside the sandbox
3. **Create sandbox** — `POST /api/v1/sandboxes` (Cloud API, Bearer token auth)
4. **Wait for RUNNING** — Poll `GET /api/v1/sandboxes?id=<id>` until status=RUNNING
5. **Upload/download tarball** — `POST /api/file/upload/<path>` (agent-server) or `curl` inside sandbox
6. **Start entrypoint** — `POST /api/bash/start_bash_command` (agent-server)
   - Extracts tarball, runs setup.sh (if present), exports env vars, runs entrypoint
7. **Return immediately** — Dispatcher does not wait for completion

Completion is handled asynchronously:
- **Happy path**: SDK inside sandbox POSTs to `POST /api/v1/automations/runs/{id}/complete`
- **Fallback**: Watchdog scans for runs past their `timeout_at` deadline, verifies status via sandbox bash history, and marks as COMPLETED or FAILED

### Env Vars Injected Into Sandbox

| Variable | Source | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `OPENHANDS_API_KEY` | Per-user key issued via service key | SDK auth for get_llm()/get_secrets() |
| `OPENHANDS_CLOUD_API_URL` | Config (`openhands_api_base_url`) | Cloud API base URL |
| `SANDBOX_ID` | From sandbox creation response | SDK reads for settings API calls |
| `SESSION_API_KEY` | From sandbox creation response | SDK reads for settings API auth |
| `AUTOMATION_CALLBACK_URL` | Constructed by dispatcher | SDK posts completion status here |
| `AUTOMATION_RUN_ID` | Run ID | Included in callback payload |
| `AUTOMATION_EVENT_PAYLOAD` | Trigger context JSON | Available to user's script; preset scripts also use it to set a descriptive conversation title |

The SDK's `OpenHandsCloudWorkspace(local_agent_server_mode=True)` reads `SANDBOX_ID`, `SESSION_API_KEY`, and `AGENT_SERVER_PORT` from env vars automatically.

## Callback & Race Condition Handling

- **Callback auth**: The completion endpoint (`/runs/{id}/complete`) uses standard API key auth — the per-user `OPENHANDS_API_KEY` passed into the sandbox is validated via `authenticate_request`, and ownership is verified against the run's parent automation.
- **Optimistic locking**: Both callback endpoint and watchdog use `UPDATE ... WHERE status = 'RUNNING'` and check `CursorResult.rowcount` to handle races. Returns 409 on conflict.
- **Sandbox cleanup**: On callback, sandbox is deleted in a fire-and-forget background task (unless `keep_alive=True`). On dispatch failure, the dispatcher deletes the sandbox immediately.

## Database

Supports **PostgreSQL** (cloud) and **SQLite** (local/self-hosted).

| Feature | PostgreSQL | SQLite |
|---------|------------|--------|
| Config | `AUTOMATION_DB_HOST`, `AUTOMATION_DB_PORT`, etc. | `AUTOMATION_DB_URL=sqlite+aiosqlite:///path.db` |
| Driver | asyncpg | aiosqlite |
| Row locking | `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` | Skipped (single-process) |
| Migrations | `alembic upgrade head` (manual) | Auto-run on startup |

### Writing Migrations

Migrations must be **cross-database compatible**:

```python
# ✅ DO: Import and use generic SQLAlchemy types
from sqlalchemy import Column, JSON, Uuid
Column("id", Uuid, primary_key=True)
Column("data", JSON, nullable=False)

# ❌ DON'T: Use PostgreSQL-specific types
from sqlalchemy.dialects.postgresql import UUID, JSONB
Column("id", UUID(as_uuid=True), ...)  # Won't work on SQLite
Column("data", JSONB, ...)             # Won't work on SQLite
```

For PostgreSQL-only features (partial indexes, advisory locks), use conditionals:

```python
def _is_sqlite() -> bool:
    return op.get_bind().dialect.name == "sqlite"

def upgrade() -> None:
    # ... create tables ...
    if not _is_sqlite():
        op.create_index("ix_partial", "table", ["col"], postgresql_where=...)
```

- **Locking patterns**: `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` in scheduler/dispatcher — check `using_sqlite()` to skip on SQLite

## Preset-Based Automation Creation

Presets are ready-to-use automation configurations where users provide arguments (like a prompt) instead of writing SDK scripts.

### Prompt Preset

The `/v1/preset/prompt` endpoint allows creating automations by simply providing a prompt, without manually creating and uploading a tarball.

#### How It Works

1. User sends `POST /v1/preset/prompt` with `name`, `prompt`, and `trigger`
2. Service generates SDK boilerplate code with the user's prompt
3. Creates a tarball containing:
   - `main.py` - SDK boilerplate that loads and executes the prompt
   - `prompt.txt` - The user's prompt text
   - `setup.sh` - SDK installation script
4. Uploads the tarball to storage (creates `TarballUpload` record)
5. Creates the `Automation` record referencing the internal upload

#### Files

- `openhands/automation/preset_router.py` - Endpoint and tarball generation logic
- `openhands/automation/presets/prompt/sdk_main.py` - SDK boilerplate that fetches LLM, secrets, and MCP config
- `openhands/automation/presets/prompt/setup.sh` - SDK installation script (installs from PyPI)

#### Request Schema

```json
{
  "name": "My Automation",
  "prompt": "Create a file called hello.txt with 'Hello World' inside",
  "trigger": {"type": "cron", "schedule": "0 9 * * 1", "timezone": "UTC"},
  "timeout": 300  // optional
}
```

### Notes

- The `presets/` directory is excluded from ruff and pyright linting since it contains SDK code that runs in the sandbox, not application code
- The generated tarball uses `python main.py` as the entrypoint and `setup.sh` as the setup script
- Future presets (e.g., plugins) can be added as additional subdirectories under `openhands/automation/presets/`

## Release Procedure

Releases are driven by [release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please)
via the centralized reusable workflows in
[`OpenHands/release-actions`](https://github.com/OpenHands/release-actions). You do
**not** bump versions or push tags by hand — release-please does both from the
Conventional Commit history. (The old manual `Prepare Release` workflow has been
removed.)

### Day-to-day flow

1. Open a PR against `main` with a [Conventional Commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org)
   title (`feat: …`, `fix: …`, `docs: …`, …). The `pr` workflow lints the title and
   applies a `type: <type>` label.
2. Squash-merge it. The **PR title becomes the commit message** release-please reads,
   so the repo is configured to squash-merge with `PR_TITLE` as the commit title.
3. On merge, release-please opens/updates a `chore(main): release X.Y.Z` PR that:
   - bumps the version everywhere it is embedded (see table below), derived from the
     merged commit types — `fix` → patch, `feat` → minor, breaking → major;
   - aggregates the GitHub release notes (grouped by `type:` label via
     `.github/release.yml`).
4. **Merging that release PR publishes the release**: it tags the commit (e.g. `1.1.0`,
   no `v` prefix) and publishes the GitHub release. The tag then triggers the publish
   workflows below, and shipped PRs are back-labeled `released: X.Y.Z`.

### Versions release-please keeps in sync

A single repo version is applied to every embedded location (configured in
`release-please-config.json`):

| File | How it is updated |
|------|-------------------|
| `pyproject.toml` (`[project].version`) | native `python` release-type |
| `uv.lock` (root package) | `toml` updater (`$.package[?(@.name.value=='openhands-automation')].version`) |
| `openhands/automation/__init__.py` (`__version__`) | `generic` updater (`# x-release-please-version`) |
| `openhands/automation/app.py` (FastAPI `version=`) | `generic` updater (`# x-release-please-version`) |

The lock file is bumped so the release PR's own CI (`uv sync --frozen`)
stays green. Keep the `# x-release-please-version` annotations on the `__init__.py`
and `app.py` version lines.

### What the release tag triggers

| Workflow | File | Action |
|----------|------|--------|
| Publish PyPI Package | `pypi-release.yml` | Builds and publishes `openhands-automation` to PyPI via OIDC trusted publishing |
| Tag Docker images | `tag-image.yml` | Aliases the existing `sha-<commit>` GHCR image to the release tag plus `X.Y` / `X` / `latest` (the `ghcr-build.yml` build for that commit must have run first) |

> Prerequisites (one-time, org/repo settings — not in this repo): the org secrets
> `RELEASE_APP_ID` / `RELEASE_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` (the GitHub App release-please uses —
> required so the release tag triggers the publish workflows above), and squash-merge
> configured with `PR_TITLE` as the commit title.

### SDK dependency bumps

When bumping `openhands-sdk` / `openhands-workspace` pins:
1. Update both versions in `pyproject.toml` dependencies.
2. Run `uv lock` to regenerate `uv.lock`.
3. Open a Conventional Commit PR (e.g. `fix: bump SDK to <ver>`) and squash-merge it —
   release-please handles the version bump and release.
4. After the release publishes, update `AUTOMATION_SHA` in the deploy repo:
   - `.github/workflows/deploy.yaml`
   - `.github/workflows/deploy-automation.yaml`
