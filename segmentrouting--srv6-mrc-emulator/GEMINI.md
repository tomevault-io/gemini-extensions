## What this lab is

A 4-plane SRv6 fabric on docker-sonic-vs + Containerlab. The default
topology is `4p-4x8` (4 planes × 4 spines × 8 leaves per plane = 32
fabric nodes, plus 16 alpine hosts: 8 green + 8 yellow). A larger scale
design `4p-8x16` (4 planes × 8 spines × 16 leaves = 128 fabric
nodes + 32 hosts) is available via `make TOPO=4p-8x16 …` or
`SRV6_TOPO=…/4p-8x16/topo.yaml`. It demonstrates the MRC + SRv6-spray
model: one logical flow fans out across all 4 planes by varying *only*
the outer SID list.

Tenants:

- **green** — hybrid: leaf does encap+uDT6 decap in `Vrf-green`. Anycast
  inner dst `2001:db8:bbbb:<NN>::2` on all 4 NICs (`nodad`).
- **yellow** — host-based: leaf does encap+uA(host-port); host runs 4
  `seg6local End.DT6` (one per plane NIC) for decap. Anycast inner dst
  `2001:db8:cccc:<NN>::2` on all 4 NICs and on `lo` (`nodad`). Mirrors
  green's anycast plan with `bbbb`→`cccc` (Phase 1a).

## Interface naming and topology structure

### Containerlab ↔ SONiC interface mapping

Docker-sonic-vs uses `Ethernet0, Ethernet4, Ethernet8, ...` (increments
of 4). Containerlab uses `eth1, eth2, eth3, ...` (starting at 1).

**Mapping formula**: `clab eth{N}` → `SONiC Ethernet{(N-1)*4}`

Examples:
- `eth1` → `Ethernet0`
- `eth2` → `Ethernet4`
- `eth9` → `Ethernet32` (leaf downlink to green host)
- `eth10` → `Ethernet36` (leaf downlink to yellow host)

### Physical topology (4p-4x8)

**Spine connections** (NO direct host connections):
- `eth1..eth8` → downlinks to 8 leaves within the plane
- `p0-spine00:eth1` (Ethernet0) ↔ `p0-leaf00:eth1` (Ethernet0)
- `p0-spine00:eth2` (Ethernet4) ↔ `p0-leaf01:eth1` (Ethernet0)
- ...
- `p0-spine00:eth8` (Ethernet28) ↔ `p0-leaf07:eth1` (Ethernet0)

**Leaf connections**:
- `eth1..eth4` → uplinks to 4 spines (one per plane)
  - `p0-leaf00:eth1` (Ethernet0) → `p0-spine00`
  - `p0-leaf00:eth2` (Ethernet4) → `p0-spine01`
  - `p0-leaf00:eth3` (Ethernet8) → `p0-spine02`
  - `p0-leaf00:eth4` (Ethernet12) → `p0-spine03`
- `eth9` (Ethernet32) → green host downlink (in `Vrf-green`)
- `eth10` (Ethernet36) → yellow host downlink (default VRF)

**Host connections**:
- `eth1..eth4` → one uplink per plane to corresponding leaf
  - `green-host00:eth1` → `p0-leaf00:eth9` (plane 0)
  - `green-host00:eth2` → `p1-leaf00:eth9` (plane 1)
  - `green-host00:eth3` → `p2-leaf00:eth9` (plane 2)
  - `green-host00:eth4` → `p3-leaf00:eth9` (plane 3)

All link information is in `topologies/<topo>/topology.clab.yaml` under
the `links:` section with `endpoints: ["node-a:ethN", "node-b:ethM"]`
format.

## Source of truth

`topologies/<name>/topo.yaml` declares the topology: planes, spines,
leaves, container images, clab topology name. The generator
(`generators/fabric.py --topo <path>`) reads it and emits
`topology.clab.yaml` + the per-node `config/*` SONiC config snippets in
the same directory. The `srv6_mrc.topo` runtime module also reads
it at import time (via the `SRV6_TOPO` env var, defaulting to
`topologies/4p-4x8/topo.yaml`). 

**Never hand-edit generated files**:
- `topologies/<name>/topology.clab.yaml`
- `topologies/<name>/config/<node>/{config_db.json,frr.conf}`

Files that must stay in sync because they share addressing/SID-list shape:

- `generators/fabric.py` (writes routes into SONiC + host configs)
- `srv6_mrc/cli/routes.py` (parses + writes host-side `ip -6 route`
  SRv6 routes)
- `srv6_mrc/cli/spray.py` (CLI; delegates encoding to
  `srv6_mrc.runner`)
- `srv6_mrc/topo.py` (fabric constants + `usid_outer_dst()` — the
  SID-list builder the runner uses)
- `srv6_mrc/runner.py` (wire format: `!QBB` seq+plane+path, 32B pad,
  sport=dport=SPRAY_PORT)
- `srv6_mrc/encap.py` (shared `build_outer_packet()` +
  `open_raw_send_socket()` helpers — used by both `runner.py` for data
  packets and `mrc/transport.py` for SRv6-encapped probes)
- `srv6_mrc/mrc/transport.py` (`MrcTransport` ABC + `Srv6RawTransport`
  + `LoopbackUdpTransport`; the agent does all I/O through this)

If you change the SID-list shape, the per-plane block layout, or any
tenant naming/addressing, all of these must be updated. The
`test_reference_pairs_match_spray` test in `tests/test_topo.py` locks
the `srv6_mrc.topo` ↔ `spray` reference-pairs map in sync.

## Hard invariants (do not violate)

1. **uSID = no SRH.** Outer is plain IPv6 with `nh = 41` (IPv6-in-IPv6);
   the SID list is the destination address itself and shifts left at each
   hop. `encap.red` semantics. Do not add SRH. If you see code or design
   notes producing or assuming an SRH on the wire, that's a bug. When
   talking about the encap, say "encap.red" or "outer IPv6 with uSID DA",
   never "SRH" — there is no SRH in this fabric. Any TX path that does
   not go through `ip -6 route add ... encap seg6 mode encap.red` (or the
   equivalent raw-socket build of that exact wire format) is wrong.
2. **Plane identity lives ONLY in the outer SID list** (the `<P>` hextet
   at index 1 of the SID). Never in the inner/tenant address. Putting
   plane in the inner address breaks the MRC invariant — the whole point
   of the demo.
3. **Per-plane uSID `/32` blocks** under the cluster `fc00:0000::/30`:
   plane P uses `fc00:<P>::/32`.
4. **Tier role hextets** are self-describing:
   - `f...` = leaf-up uA (spine→leaf)
   - `e...` = spine-down uA *and* leaf→host uA (overloaded; tier is
     disambiguated by position in the SID list)
   - `d...` = tenant uDT6 (decap into VRF / End.DT6)
5. **`e<NIC ordinal>` rule**, not `e<port number>`:
   - `Ethernet0`  → `e000`
   - `Ethernet32` → `e008`
   - `Ethernet36` → `e009`
   This bit us before. Don't "fix" it back to using port numbers.
6. **Green leaf VRF**: `Ethernet32` lives in `Vrf-green`; leaf `d000`
   uDT6 decaps into it.
7. **Yellow decap on host, not leaf**: yellow's `End.DT6` runs on the
   host's NIC (one per plane), not on the leaf. The sender's SID list
   includes the extra `e009` hop (leaf→host) that green omits.
8. **Sender plane selection is NIC-bound, not route-metric-bound.**
   `spray` uses a raw IPv6 socket per plane with `SO_BINDTODEVICE`.
   Kernel ECMP would defeat plane spray since green's inner dst is
   anycast. Don't replace this with kernel routing.
9. **`encap seg6` route shape** (what `routes` and `delete --all`
   match on) is what defines "an SRv6 pair route". Yellow's per-NIC
   `seg6local End.DT6` rules are *decap* policies, intentionally not
   touched by `routes` apply/delete (they're installed by the
   generator).
10. **Spine entropy via SID rotation, never kernel ECMP.** When EV-
    spray varies the spine per packet, the runner builds a new outer
    DA in scapy (`usid_outer_dst(tenant, plane, spine, dst_leaf)`)
    and sends through the same plane-bound raw socket. Do NOT add
    multipath/ECMP host routes per spine and rely on the kernel
    hashing flows across them — that defeats per-packet EV identity
    (the receiver-side health table needs every packet's EV to be
    known to the sender, not chosen randomly by the kernel) and
    would resurrect the same anycast/ECMP ambiguity that invariant 8
    exists to prevent. Per-EV state attribution (planned for Phase
    1b step 3) depends on the sender owning the spine choice.
11. **Stateless-probe per-EV /128 ownership is exclusive.** Each
    `probe_ev_addr(tenant, host, plane, path)` (e.g. yellow
    `2001:db8:cccc:0::10` = host00 eth1 path 0) is configured on
    EXACTLY ONE host — the owner. Adding it locally anywhere else
    (including the peer that's supposed to forward the probe back)
    causes that host's kernel to claim the returning probe and
    silently kill the round trip. Generator pins this in
    `tests/test_generator_stateless_probes.py::test_per_ev_addrs_unique_per_host`;
    runtime side asserts the same in
    `srv6_mrc/topo.py::probe_ev_addr`. If you ever generate `/128`s
    in a new addressing block (e.g. green parity), enforce the same
    uniqueness test before shipping.
12. **Stateless-probe inner-src placeholder is unrouted, period.**
    `srv6_mrc.topo.probe_inner_src(tenant)` (yellow:
    `2001:db8:cccc::ffff`) MUST NOT be locally configured on any
    host or appear in any FIB. Kernel sees it briefly on egress and
    the returning probe carries it inbound — neither needs a route.
    Configuring it locally would have the kernel claim it on egress
    and reject the source-routing. Generator pins this in
    `test_inner_src_placeholder_never_configured`.
13. **Stateless-probe `dfff` decap on leaves is exactly one
    static-sid per leaf per plane, into vrf default (Linux table
    main).** The FRR line is
    `sid fc00:000<P>:dfff::/48 locator MAIN behavior uDT6 vrf default`.
    Pointing it into a tenant VRF would deliver the inner packet
    to the wrong RIB and the connected route back to the sender's
    host would be missing. The runbook in
    `docs/stateless-probes-validation.md` originally used
    `ip -6 route add ... encap seg6local action End.DT6 table 254 dev <iface>`
    for the hand-validation, but production state goes through FRR
    so `make config`'s verify+repair loop counts it correctly.
14. **Peer-host kernel forwarding must be ON for stateless probes
    to round-trip.** Generator sets
    `sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding=1` in every yellow
    host's clab `exec:` block. Alpine defaults forwarding=0; the
    peer's role in the probe round trip is pure IPv6 forwarding
    on the still-encapped outer DA (the inner-dst is by invariant
    11 not locally configured on the peer), so without this the
    peer silently drops every probe at FIB lookup time. Generator
    pins this in `test_ipv6_forwarding_enabled_on_every_yellow_host`.
15. **One `(::, SPRAY_REPORT_PORT)` bind per host, owned by the
    MRC daemon.** `Srv6RawTransport.__init__` opens the UDP
    listener ONLY when `is_sender=True`. The receiver-side
    transport (constructed by `ReceiverMrcAgent` with
    `is_sender=False`) MUST NOT open a second bind on the same
    port — even with SO_REUSEPORT, the kernel hash-steers half
    the returning stateless probes to whichever socket the hash
    selects, and the receiver-process socket has no consumer
    (loss reports are TX-only via `_raw_sockets[plane]`).
    Symptom of a double-bind: yellow-all-to-all (or any scenario
    where a host is both sender AND receiver) reports
    `window_recv=0` on every EV of half the senders → universal
    `assumed_bad` despite a clean data plane. Same class of bug
    as the sender-side SO_REUSEPORT cascade resolved in PR #1;
    the v4 stateless-probes redesign re-exposed it on the
    receiver path until cycle 14 (2026-05-25) tightened the
    bind. Tests `ReceiverNoReportListenerTests.*` in
    `tests/test_mrc_transport.py` pin it.

## Roadmap

### Live visibility / Grafana dashboard (planned)

Currently the per-plane balance story — the headline of this demo —
is observable only by `jq`-ing post-run JSON reports. A live
dashboard would make spray balance, MRC EV demotion, and fault-
injection effects observable in real time during a scenario run.

Sketch:

- One Prometheus + Grafana container pair stood up by `make deploy`
  alongside the fabric (declared in `topology.clab.yaml`, not
  side-channel docker-compose, so `make destroy` tears them down).
- A scraper sidecar polls fabric nodes via `ip -stats link show
  <iface>` (per-interface bps/pps for the per-plane balance graph)
  and hosts via `cat /proc/net/snmp6` (Udp6RcvbufErrors etc. — the
  diagnostic counters we keep grepping by hand every lab cycle).
- For tighter scrape intervals than `docker exec` can sustain
  (~50-100ms per exec × ~50 containers on 4p-4x8), use `nsenter`
  from a privileged container in the host PID namespace instead.
- The scraper must apply the same retry-on-rc=1 pattern documented
  for `docker exec cat` (see "RESOLVED: SO_REUSEPORT cascade"
  gotcha list).
- Exposed via a fixed port on the topology host so users can hit
  `http://<topology-host>:3000` directly.

Headline panels:
- Per-plane TX bps + pps on a chosen leaf NIC set
- Per-flow EV active count (live read of `/dev/shm/srv6-mrc/.../
  *.json` snapshots, same shape `report.py` consumes)
- Probe success rate / RTT p50 per EV over time
- Fault-injection markers (tc netem add/del events) as
  annotations

Not started. Don't block probe/scenario correctness work on this —
it's a parallel vertical with no code-path overlap.

- **Phase 1a (plane-aware MRC):** done, validated in lab for BOTH
  tenants (green + yellow). Plane-level loss detection via receiver
  MRC agent; sender demotes lossy planes in `health_aware_mrc`
  policy.
- **Phase 1b step 1 (EV-spray data-path):** done + lab-validated for
  BOTH tenants. `EvSpray` policy varies BOTH plane and spine per packet
  via per-packet outer-DA rotation. Reports include `per_ev_sent` keyed
  `"P<p>:S<s>"`. No health awareness on its own — every EV is always
  active. Scenarios shipped: `green-ev-spray.yaml`,
  `green-ev-spray-n2.yaml`, `yellow-ev-spray.yaml`,
  `yellow-ev-spray-n2.yaml`. The data wire format carries `path` (the
  MRC-layer name for `spine`) in the payload so the receiver can
  attribute per-EV stats.
- **Phase 1b step 2 (per-EV scapy raw-socket probes):** done. Probe TX
  moved off the per-plane UDP+`encap.red`-route path onto a shared
  `srv6_mrc/encap.build_outer_packet()` raw-socket builder — the
  same helper the data path uses for EV-spray. Probes are now per
  `(plane, path)` EV, so probe granularity matches data-path EV
  granularity (NUM_PLANES × NUM_SPINES probes per round). All I/O for
  both `SenderMrcAgent` and `ReceiverMrcAgent` flows through an
  `MrcTransport` (`Srv6RawTransport` in lab, `LoopbackUdpTransport`
  in tests). The sender collapses to one rx socket on
  `SPRAY_REPORT_PORT` that demuxes PROBE_REPLY (magic `0xA6`) vs
  LOSS_REPORT (magic `0xA7`); per-plane reply-rx loops are gone.
  Receiver replies on the same `(plane, path)` the inbound PROBE
  arrived on; loss reports ride the last-seen-PROBE EV per sender.
  Scenarios shipped: `green-mrc-ev-spray.yaml`, `yellow-mrc-ev-spray.yaml`.
- **Phase 1b step 3 (per-EV health):** not started. New policy that
  extends `EvSpray` with an "active EV mask" read from a per-EV
  health table (the `EVStateTable` is already per-EV in step 2 — it
  keys on `(tenant, plane, path)`). On loss detection at an EV
  granularity, the sender skips that EV on its round-robin turn.
  Ship both `green-mrc-ev-spray-*` and `yellow-mrc-ev-spray-*`
  scenario sets together — yellow parity is now the steady-state
  expectation, not a follow-up.
- **Collective-communication scenarios (in progress):** scaffolding
  shipped for AI-style traffic patterns on top of the existing
  `health_aware_mrc` data path.
  - Pair-set aliases in `srv6_mrc/mrc/scenario.py`:
    `{green,yellow}-all-to-all` (N*(N-1) ordered pairs) and
    `{green,yellow}-ring` (N pairs forming `i -> (i+1) mod N`,
    NCCL-style unidirectional ring). Both auto-size from
    `NUM_LEAVES`: 240 / 16 on 4p-8x16, 56 / 8 on 2p-4x8.
  - 4p-8x16 scenarios shipped:
    `green-all-to-all.yaml`, `yellow-all-to-all.yaml`
    (240 flows @ 20pps, `paths_per_plane: 8`),
    `green-allreduce-ring.yaml`, `yellow-allreduce-ring.yaml`
    (16 flows @ 100pps, `paths_per_plane: 8`), plus the diagnostic
    `yellow-allreduce-ring-half.yaml` (paths_per_plane: 4).
  - **Known-broken**: every `health_aware_mrc` scenario where every
    host runs *both* a sender process AND a receiver process (i.e.
    the ring and all-to-all patterns) fails to keep EVs healthy.
    At paths_per_plane=8 every flow ends with ~16/32 EVs demoted to
    `assumed_bad` despite 0% data-plane loss; per-plane traffic
    spreads ~5-7x. `yellow-mrc-ev-spray` (8 senders, 8 *different*
    receivers, same paths_per_plane=8) is unaffected. See "Things
    learned" below for the current diagnostic state.

    **2026-05-20 RESOLVED** (PR #1, merged): structural cure was the
    MRC daemon refactor + sniffer egress filter + orphan-prevention
    teardown. Lab-verified clean on `4p-4x8` `yellow-all-to-all` over
    4 consecutive runs (~0.1% loss steady, zero orphans between runs).
    See "RESOLVED: SO_REUSEPORT cascade on collective scenarios" below
    for full diagnosis and fix.

## Yellow parity — do not forget

Every spray feature added for green needs a yellow counterpart in
the same commit (or the immediate follow-up). Past pattern: green
gets a feature, yellow lags by N commits, and the demo story
becomes "green works, yellow is broken in interesting ways."
Concretely:

- New policy → exercise it in both `green-…yaml` and `yellow-…yaml`
  scenarios before declaring the feature done.
- New probe / health code path → test with both tenants in the
  lab; yellow's host-side decap (invariant 7) is the failure mode
  green never exposes.
- Phase 1b step 1's yellow-ev-spray YAMLs are the immediate
  outstanding piece. Pick those up at the same time as step 2's
  scapy probes — they're cheap (~20 lines of YAML each) and rerun
  the same `green-ev-spray-n2` validation against yellow as a
  yellow-decap regression check.

## Naming conventions

- Containers: `p<P>-spine<NN>`, `p<P>-leaf<NN>`, `<tenant>-host<NN>`.
- Host N attaches to `leafN` on every plane. (`hostNN` ↔ `leafNN`.)
- User-facing term is **"tenant"**, never "color".

## Tooling specifics

### `routes` (`srv6_mrc/cli/routes.py`)

Declarative kubectl-style route manager. Requires PyYAML.
Spec format: `apiVersion: srv6-lab/v1`, `kind: RouteSet`, with `pairs`
and/or `mesh` entries only. **There is intentionally no low-level
`routes:` escape hatch** — keep specs high-level.

`spine: auto` resolves via `REFERENCE_PAIRS_SPINES` lookup, falling back
to `(a*16+b) % 8` hash.

Subcommands:

```
routes apply  -f spec.yaml
routes delete -f spec.yaml
routes delete --all
routes list   [--host h1,h2] [--tenant green|yellow] [-o wide|raw]
```

`list` modes:

- default — collapsed: `-> <tenant>-host<NN>  via spine<NN>  planes [...]`
- `-o wide` — full per-plane path: `p<P>-leaf<src> -> p<P>-spine<NN> -> p<P>-leaf<dst>  (eth<P+1> metric 10<P>)`
- `-o raw` / `--raw` — literal `ip -6 route` lines

### `spray` (`srv6_mrc/cli/spray.py`)

Userspace SRv6 sprayer, image `alpine-srv6-scapy:1.0`. The image
pip-installs the `srv6_mrc` package at build time, so `spray` lives
at `/usr/local/bin/spray` inside every host container — no bind mounts
needed for code. The active topology's `topo.yaml` is bind-mounted
into each host container at runtime by containerlab (per the
`binds:` block in `topology.clab.yaml`), landing at
`/etc/srv6_mrc/topo.yaml`; the image exports `SRV6_TOPO` pointing
at that path. This means a single image serves every topology
variant — the topology identity moves with the container, not the
image.

`--role send|recv`, auto-detects tenant from hostname. Sender uses one
raw socket per plane bound via `SO_BINDTODEVICE`. Receiver sniffs at NIC
pre-decap (yellow can't sniff post-decap on `lo` per-NIC).

Notable flags:
- `--policy {round_robin,hash5tuple,weighted:0.4,0.3,0.2,0.1,ev_spray[:N],health_aware_mrc}`
  — default `round_robin`. `health_aware_mrc` only does something useful
  when the sender also starts a `SenderMrcAgent` (auto-started from
  `cmd_send` when this policy is selected). `ev_spray[:N]` varies BOTH
  plane AND spine per packet (4 * N EVs total); bare `ev_spray` uses
  the full fan-out (N = `NUM_SPINES` from `topo.yaml`). The outer DA's
  `f<S>` hextet rotates packet-by-packet so each EV traces a distinct
  leaf-to-spine path; the receiver doesn't care which EV a probe came
  from, because the data-path runner doesn't use kernel routes for the
  outer encap (scapy builds the wire form directly).
- `--paths-per-plane N` — runtime override for `ev_spray` fan-out.
  Equivalent to `ev_spray:N` in `--policy` but lets scenario YAML's
  `paths_per_plane` field propagate via the `SRV6_PATHS_PER_PLANE` env
  without rewriting the policy string. Order of precedence: explicit
  `ev_spray:N` in `--policy` > `--paths-per-plane` CLI flag >
  `SRV6_PATHS_PER_PLANE` env > policy default (`NUM_SPINES`).
- `--mrc` — receiver-only flag; opens probe-reply + loss-emit sockets
  and starts a `ReceiverMrcAgent`. Off by default; baseline runs are
  unaffected.
- `--json` — emit machine-readable result instead of human-readable
  output; used by the orchestrator (`run-scenario`).

The orchestrator sets `SRV6_MRC_CONFIG_JSON` on every `docker exec` when
the scenario has an `mrc:` block. Both `cmd_send` and `cmd_recv` decode
it via `srv6_mrc.mrc.agent.load_configs_from_env()` into
`(AgentConfig, EVStateConfig | None)`. Unknown keys, bad JSON, or
non-object payloads fail loud rather than reverting to defaults.

### `run-scenario` (`srv6_mrc/mrc/run.py`)

Docker-host-side orchestrator for MRC scenarios. Loads a scenario YAML,
applies fault injection via `nsenter ... tc qdisc add ...` against host
veths, runs `spray` send/recv inside the relevant containers via
`docker exec`, and merges the JSON output into a `ScenarioReport`.

```
run-scenario topologies/4p-4x8/scenarios/green-mrc-baseline.yaml --verbose
run-scenario topologies/4p-4x8/scenarios/green-mrc-plane-loss.yaml --dry-run
```

`--dry-run` prints the plan plus the exact `nsenter ... tc qdisc add ...`
argvs that would be invoked — useful for verifying fault targeting
without touching the lab.

### `srctl fault` — Manual Fault Injection

`srctl fault` provides interactive fault injection for testing MRC
behavior against fabric failures. Faults are tracked in
`/dev/shm/srv6-mrc-faults.json` for cleanup. This replaces the legacy
embedded `faults:` blocks in scenario YAMLs with an explicit,
stateful CLI workflow.

#### Subcommands

```bash
# Shutdown interface(s) — bidirectional by default
srctl fault shutdown <node> <interface> [<interface>...]
srctl fault shutdown <node> all  # shutdown all interfaces on node
srctl fault shutdown <node> <interface> --unidirectional  # one side only

# Inject tc/netem (loss, delay, etc.) on host-side veths
srctl fault netem "<target>" "<spec>"

# Clear faults
srctl fault clear --all
srctl fault clear <node>
srctl fault clear <node> <interface>

# List active faults
srctl fault list
srctl fault list -o json
```

#### Examples

**Test MRC against single EV failure**:

```bash
# Break EV p0-spine01 (all 8 downlinks to leaves)
srctl fault shutdown p0-spine01 all

# Run without MRC (expect ~6% loss on affected flows)
srctl run yellow-ev-spray --duration 5

# Run with MRC (expect 0% loss, 15/16 EVs active, p0-spine01 unused)
srctl run yellow-mrc-ev-spray --duration 5

# Clean up
srctl fault clear --all
```

**Test MRC against partial loss**:

```bash
# Inject 5% loss on plane 2 of host00
srctl fault netem "host yellow-host00 plane 2" "loss 5%"

# Run with MRC (expect demote, weight shift away from plane 2)
srctl run yellow-mrc-baseline --duration 10

# Check active faults
srctl fault list

# Clean up
srctl fault clear --all
```

**Break a specific link**:

```bash
# Break p0-spine01 ↔ p0-leaf00 link (bidirectional)
srctl fault shutdown p0-spine01 Ethernet0
# This also shuts down p0-leaf00:Ethernet4 (the peer)

# Run scenario
srctl run yellow-all-to-all --duration 30

# Expect: MRC detects + demotes affected EVs, traffic routes around failure

# Clean up
srctl fault clear p0-spine01
```

**Asymmetric failure** (unidirectional):

```bash
# Only shut down spine side, leave leaf side up
srctl fault shutdown p0-spine01 Ethernet0 --unidirectional

# Asymmetric failures can expose routing or failure-detection edge cases
```

**Multiple interfaces on one node**:

```bash
# Shut down two spine downlinks simultaneously
srctl fault shutdown p1-spine03 Ethernet4 Ethernet8

# Each shutdown is bidirectional by default
```

#### Fault State Tracking

All faults are persisted to `/dev/shm/srv6-mrc-faults.json`:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "faults": [
    {
      "id": "fault-001",
      "type": "shutdown",
      "targets": [
        {"node": "p0-spine01", "interface": "Ethernet0"},
        {"node": "p0-leaf00", "interface": "Ethernet4"}
      ],
      "spec": "down",
      "bidirectional": true,
      "applied_at": "2024-05-26T10:32:15Z",
      "applied_by": "srctl fault"
    }
  ]
}
```

`srctl fault clear` uses this state to restore interfaces. Always run
`clear --all` between test runs to avoid orphaned faults.

#### netem Target Syntax

netem targets are host-side veths (reuses `srv6_mrc.netem` module):

- `"plane N"` → all host NICs in plane N (32 NICs: 16 green + 16 yellow)
- `"host NAME"` → all 4 uplinks of one host
- `"host NAME plane N"` → single NIC (e.g., `yellow-host00:eth3`)

netem spec strings are passed directly to `tc qdisc add ... netem`:

- `"loss 5%"` — random 5% packet loss
- `"loss 5% 25%"` — Markov-correlated loss (5% base, 25% correlation)
- `"delay 50ms 10ms 25%"` — mean delay 50ms, jitter 10ms, corr 25%
- `"delay 50ms loss 1%"` — combined delay + loss

#### Deprecation Note

The old `faults:` block in scenario YAMLs (e.g.,
`green-mrc-plane-loss.yaml`) is now deprecated. Use `srctl fault`
for all new testing workflows.

### MRC architecture (current build)

`health_aware_mrc` is the live MRC policy. It reads weights from an
`EVStateTable` shared with a `SenderMrcAgent` running in the same
process. All probe / reply / loss-report I/O is delegated to an
`MrcTransport` (`srv6_mrc/mrc/transport.py`): `Srv6RawTransport`
in the lab (raw-socket SRv6 encap via `srv6_mrc.encap`),
`LoopbackUdpTransport` in unit tests. There is one code path; the
agent never branches on transport.

The sender drives four background threads:

- `mrc-emit` — emits one PROBE per `(plane, path)` EV every
  `probe_interval_ms`. With 4 planes × 8 spines that's 32 probes
  per round.
- `mrc-reply-rx` — single rx socket on `SPRAY_REPORT_PORT`, demuxes
  by magic byte: `0xA6` → PROBE_REPLY (feeds
  `EVStateTable.record_probe_result(tenant, plane, path, ...)`);
  `0xA7` → LOSS_REPORT (feeds `record_loss_window`). Replaces the
  pre-step-2 design's per-plane reply sockets and the separate
  loss-report-rx loop.
- `mrc-sweep` — declares in-flight probes lost after
  `probe_timeout_ms`.
- `mrc-window` — advances the per-EV `SentWindowRing` so the
  receiver-side loss-fusion has matching `(plane, path)` sent
  counts to compare against.

The receiver-side counterpart (`ReceiverMrcAgent`) runs two threads:
`mrc-probe-rx` (replies on the same `(plane, path)` EV the inbound
PROBE arrived on) and `mrc-report-emit` (one LOSS_REPORT round per
`loss_window_ms` per known sender, sent on the last-seen-PROBE EV
for that sender). The data-record hook is called from the existing
receiver hot loop via `on_packet=`.

Detection signals fused into `EVStateTable`:

1. **EV Probes** — per `(plane, path)` SRv6-encapped raw-socket
   probes, RTT-stamped. Demotes after `probe_fail_threshold`
   consecutive timeouts.
2. **Receiver-side loss reports** — receiver computes per-EV
   `(plane, path)` `(seen, expected_local, max_gap)` and unicasts
   to the sender; sender compares against its own per-EV sent
   windows (`SentWindowRing` is 2-D `[plane][path]`). Demotes after
   `loss_demote_consecutive` windows over `loss_threshold`.

Demotions are subject to an `min_active_evs` floor (OCP's
`ev_min_active`). Recovery is asymmetric: demote fast, recover slow
(`probe_recover_threshold` defaults to 5).

### Known limitations

- **Receiver loss estimator needs partial loss.** The receiver estimates
  per-plane `expected = max_seq − min_seq + 1`. A 100% blackholed plane
  has zero arrivals, so the loss window reports 0/0 and the plane stays
  UNKNOWN. The probe channel still catches a hard blackhole (no replies
  → `probe_fail_threshold` timeouts → demote), but a partial-loss netem
  scenario will demote much faster than a blackhole one.
- **Reorder isn't a demote signal yet.** Latency-only faults
  (`green-mrc-plane-latency.yaml`) leave loss windows clean and probe
  replies arrive (slow but successful), so plane state stays GOOD. The
  per-plane RTT ring is collected for diagnostics but not consulted by
  the weight builder. This is by design today; the plane-latency
  scenario is the regression fixture for when RTT-aware weighting
  lands.
- **Per-flow MRC agent, not per-host.** Today there's one
  `SenderMrcAgent` per spray invocation, so two simultaneous flows from
  the same host emit duplicate probe streams. A per-host agent with IPC
  is the planned commit-3 refactor.

### Lab validation status (green tenant)

First end-to-end lab run on the docker-sonic-vs 4-plane fabric
confirms the three headline green-tenant scenarios behave as designed
(see `docs/design-mrc.md` for the detailed table):

- `green-mrc-baseline` — uniform spray, all planes `GOOD`, 0% loss
- `green-mrc-plane-loss` — 5% loss on plane 2 triggers loss-path
  demotion (`consecutive_loss_demote_windows ≥ 2`); plane 2 weight
  drops to 0, planes 0/1/3 carry uniformly, total loss ≈ 0.07% vs
  ~1.25% under round-robin (16× improvement)
- `green-mrc-plane-latency` — 10ms delay on plane 3 leaves all planes
  `GOOD` at weight 0.25 each; plane 3 RTT p50 ≈ 21ms is observed in
  EV-state diagnostics but correctly not acted on

The sender's `--json` output includes an `mrc` block (EV-state +
LossFusionStats) when `--policy=health_aware_mrc` is active; the
ScenarioReport JSON passes it through as `flows[].mrc`. Inspect with:

```bash
jq '.flows[].mrc' results/green-mrc-plane-loss.json
```

Yellow MRC scenarios (`yellow-mrc-ev-spray.yaml` etc.) ship in the
same commit set as their green counterparts as of Phase 1b step 2.
Per-host MRC agent w/ IPC (deduplicate probes across N flows on
one host) is the next milestone.

### Gotcha: rebuild the image whenever `srv6_mrc/` changes

`make image` runs `docker build`; layer caching has occasionally
shipped a stale `srv6_mrc` package inside the container even after
a clean `git pull`. Symptom is line-number mismatches between local
tracebacks and container tracebacks. When in doubt:

```bash
docker build --no-cache -f host-image/Dockerfile -t alpine-srv6-scapy:1.0 .
docker run --rm alpine-srv6-scapy:1.0 \
    wc -l /usr/lib/python3.12/site-packages/srv6_mrc/mrc/agent.py
```

The line count should match the local `srv6_mrc/mrc/agent.py`.
Roadmapped: a `make image` sanity rail to fail the build if the line
count drifts.

### Per-NIC RX in `ScenarioReport` (unchanged limitation)

Receiver reports per-NIC totals aggregated across flows. The merge
attaches them to the first matched flow per receiver; multi-sender-to-
one-receiver loses per-NIC fidelity. `FlowStats` would need a per-NIC
counter to fix this.

### Removed: `scripts/validate.sh`

Previously a ping+tcpdump per-plane verification harness. Removed because
its model — ping with `-I eth<N>` to force outbound plane — couldn't verify
the return path: ICMPv6 replies bypass any plane affinity (the kernel just
picks the lowest-metric route to the source's anycast address), so planes
1..N-1 always reported FAIL. End-to-end verification is now via
`make scenario SCEN=green-mrc-baseline`, which uses spray (sender-side plane
selection via SO_BINDTODEVICE) and measures per-plane stats at the receiver.

## Test command (run from repo root)

```
PYTHONPATH=. python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -t .
```

or:

```
make test
```

329 tests, ~1.5s, no lab needed.

## Gotchas (caught the hard way)

- **Alpine iproute2 output**: addresses print in canonical-collapsed form
  (`fc00:0:f000:e00f:d000::`, not `fc00:0000:...`). Parsers must match
  both forms. `segs` prints in bracketed form: `segs 1 [ <addr> ]`.
- **iproute2 omits `/128`** from natural-width host-route dst even when
  installed as `/128`. Parsers should not require it.
- **Container short names work directly** (`green-host00`) — no
  `clab-<topo>-` prefix needed when invoking `docker exec`.
- **CAP_NET_RAW**: `spray` needs it; clab privileged containers have it.
- **SIGPIPE**: `routes` installs `SIG_DFL` so `routes list | head`
  doesn't traceback. Keep this if you refactor `main()`.
- **Tenant container suffix is the leaf id in hex** (`...:f::2` is
  host15), and SID f-hextet `f00<N>` is spine N. `routes`'s
  `_decode_*` helpers depend on this.
- **IPv6 string canonicalization**: `fc00:0000:f000:0e00:d000::` and
  `fc00:0:f000:e00f:d000::` are equal but the strings differ. Anywhere
  that compares IPv6 addresses-as-strings, route them through
  `ipaddress.IPv6Address` first. See `_canon_addr()` in
  `srv6_mrc/report.py`.
- **`yellow-mrc-ev-spray` is NOT a general MRC smoke test**: it works
  because hosts 0-7 are senders-only and hosts 8-15 are receivers-only
  — a host runs `SenderMrcAgent` XOR `ReceiverMrcAgent`, never both.
  Any scenario where the same host appears as both source AND
  destination across the flow set (ring, all-to-all, any future
  collective) puts both agents in the same network namespace and
  exposes a class of bugs that the sender-only/receiver-only scenarios
  never hit. Treat collective-comm scenarios as a distinct regression
  surface from the existing MRC scenarios.
- **`select_spines_for_addrs` doesn't balance at small N**: with N=16
  ring pairs and paths_per_plane=4 (= 16 EVs per pair from a 32-EV
  grid), the union of selected (plane, spine) cells across all 16
  pairs is non-uniform. Per-plane traffic can still skew 3-4x even
  when all MRC weights are equal. all-to-all (N=240) gets way more
  entropy and is expected to self-balance. Not a bug per se — just
  a property to be aware of when reading ring-scenario reports.
- **`SRV6_TOPO` must be set before any srv6_mrc import**: module-level
  constants `NUM_LEAVES`, `NUM_PLANES`, `NUM_SPINES` (in `srv6_mrc.topo`)
  bind once at import time from whatever topology the env var points
  at. Auto-sized scenario aliases (`<tenant>-pairs`, `-ring`,
  `-all-to-all`) use those constants directly, so a stale or missing
  `SRV6_TOPO` produces silently-wrong host IDs (e.g. expanding
  `yellow-pairs` to 8 mirror pairs touching host15 on a topology
  that only has 8 hosts). The CLI entrypoints `srv6_mrc.mrc.run`
  and `srv6_mrc.cli.srctl` set `SRV6_TOPO` themselves before any
  srv6_mrc import by inspecting argv for the scenario path/name —
  see `_infer_srv6_topo_from_argv()` in each. The Makefile sets it
  inline on every target that runs srv6_mrc Python (`host-routes`,
  `scenario`). If you add a new entrypoint, do the same.
- **`config interface shutdown/startup` on docker-sonic-vs strips the L3
  IPv6 address binding.** `docker exec <node> config interface shutdown
  EthernetN` toggles admin state in CONFIG_DB; the matching `startup`
  reverses admin state but *does not always re-install* the
  `INTERFACE|EthernetN|<addr>/127` L3 binding. The port returns to
  `up/up` administratively with only its link-local — any packet that
  needs to reach the peer's underlay (`2001:db8:fab:N::/127`) is
  silently blackholed. The smoking-gun MRC symptom is
  `cps=0, cpt>>3, transitions=1` on the EVs whose **reply** path
  egresses that port (probes go one direction, the reply needs the
  reverse-direction egress); meanwhile the data plane shows 0% loss
  because the policy correctly steers around the demoted EVs. **For
  repeatable fault injection in MRC tests use one of:**
    - `docker exec <node> ip link set EthernetN down` and `... up`
      (touches netdev only, CONFIG_DB and L3 bindings persist;
      simplest cable-yank semantics — verify it works cleanly with
      docker-sonic-vs SAI/orchagent before adopting broadly),
    - `sudo nsenter -t $(docker inspect -f '{{.State.Pid}}' <node>)
      -n tc qdisc add dev EthernetN root netem loss 100%` then
      `... tc qdisc del dev EthernetN root` (what `srctl scenario`
      plane-loss already uses; zero-touch on container), or
    - `ip -6 addr del/add` on the address itself (most explicit but
      requires remembering the per-port subnet:
      `Ethernet0=2001:db8:fab::/127`, `Ethernet4=2001:db8:fab:1::/127`,
      etc — error-prone for non-zero ports).
  **To recover from an already-stripped binding**: `make config`
  re-pushes CONFIG_DB and auto-repairs (`scripts/config.sh` already
  does verify+repair on `seg6local` rules; the L3 address binding
  comes back along with it). The MRC stack itself handles this
  correctly — the "stuck demotion" was a lab-hygiene artifact, not
  an MRC bug. Found 2026-05-23 during validation of the demux/policy
  fixes.
- **MRC daemon writes snapshots in a wrapped envelope; readers must
  unwrap.** `MrcDaemon._publish_snapshot` writes
  `{"src_host":..., "tenant":..., "dst_id":..., "captured_ns":...,
   "ev_state": <EVStateTable.snapshot()>}` — the actual snapshot
  payload lives under the `ev_state` key, with traceability metadata
  at the top level. The `MrcSnapshot` policy
  (`policy.py::_wgrid_from_snapshot`) and `report.py::_active_evs_from_mrc`
  both accept the wrapped shape; if you add a new consumer, do the
  same (look for `ev_state` and unwrap before reading `num_planes`
  etc.). Pre-fix, the policy read `data["num_planes"]` directly,
  hit `KeyError`, swallowed it at the caller as `refresh_errors +=
  1`, and the policy kept its cold-start uniform grid **forever** —
  the sender never honored any demotion. Unit tests in
  `tests/test_mrc_snapshot_policy.py::_make_snapshot` write the flat
  shape directly via `EVStateTable.snapshot()`, predating the daemon
  wrapper; new tests should follow `test_daemon_wrapped_snapshot_accepted`
  and use the wrapper to model the real I/O contract. Found
  2026-05-23 alongside the demux IPv6 canonicalization fix; the
  two together account for the entire "EV demoted by daemon but
  sender keeps spraying through it" failure mode.
  **Inner EV-records shape (verified 2026-05-23 lab snapshot)**:
  `.ev_state.tenants["<tenant>"]` is a **list** of per-EV dicts
  `{plane, path, state, consecutive_probe_timeouts,
   consecutive_probe_successes, consecutive_loss_demote_windows,
   last_loss_ratio, rtt_p50_ns, rtt_p99_ns, transitions,
   demotes_suppressed_by_floor, weight}`. NOT a dict keyed by
  `"P<p>:S<s>"`. Top-level also includes `config:
  {probe_fail_threshold, probe_recover_threshold, loss_threshold,
   loss_demote_consecutive, min_active_evs}`, `num_planes`,
  `num_paths`. `rtt_p50_ns` can be `null` on EVs that never
  registered a successful probe — guard with `// 0` in jq.
- **Every byte-template / manual-checksum helper call site must
  be exercised through the public transport API end-to-end, not
  just in isolation.** Unit-level tests for `build_outer_template`
  and `udp6_checksum_inplace` (`tests/test_encap_template.py`)
  pass arguments by name with the right values — they're
  validating the algorithm, not the call sites that consume it.
  The 2026-05-23 lab crash was caused by:
    1. `_prewarm_reply_templates` calling `build_outer_template(
       src_underlay=..., dst_outer=..., src_inner=..., dst_inner=...,
       sport=..., dport=...)` without the required `payload_len=`
       kwarg — receiver crashed at startup, every flow showed
       `rx=0`.
    2. `send_probe_reply` calling `udp6_checksum_inplace(pkt,
       UDP_HEADER_LEN + payload_len)` — positional arg into a
       `*, payload_len` kw-only parameter, AND wrong value
       (function wants UDP payload length, not UDP header+payload).
       Hidden behind bug #1; would have silently corrupted every
       reply's UDP6 checksum once bug #1 was fixed.
  Both passed the unit suite because no test built an
  `Srv6RawTransport(is_sender=False)` end-to-end and asserted the
  reply bytes match the scapy slow path. Regression tests now in
  `tests/test_mrc_transport.py::ReceiverPrewarmStartupTests` and
  `::FastPathByteIdentityTests` (the byte-identity test mocks
  raw sockets, so it runs without CAP_NET_RAW, but is scapy-gated;
  the prewarm test that needs scapy is too — laptop without scapy
  catches the **sender** side of the same family via
  `test_sender_init_skips_prewarm`). **When adding ANY new
  byte-template path (e.g. probe-emit fast-path on the sender
  side, which is the current top hypothesis for the "every host
  is both sender AND receiver" investigation), follow the same
  pattern: byte-identity against the scapy slow path is the only
  honest oracle for "is the checksum right".**

## Open investigations (not yet root-caused)

These are bugs surfaced by the collective-comm scenarios; carry
forward across sessions until resolved. Adding new diagnostic data?
Update this section, don't start a fresh "what we know" thread.

**Active design pivot (2026-05-25)**: cycle 13 cleared kernel-rx
dwell as the bottleneck; the match step is the actual binding
constraint. Work is moving to `feature/stateless-probes`. See the
2026-05-25 entry below and `docs/stateless-probes-validation.md`.
The existing investigation notes below (probe-failure root cause,
SO_REUSEPORT cascade, etc.) remain accurate for the stateful-probe
design but are superseded for the new path.

### Universal probe failure in "every host is both sender AND receiver" scenarios

**Symptom**: Run `yellow-allreduce-ring` (16 flows, 16 hosts each
acting as both source and destination in the ring). Data plane is
perfect (0% loss, 5800 packets per flow, balanced delivery). But
the MRC snapshot shows **every EV has 294-296 consecutive probe
timeouts and 0 successes**. Half end up `assumed_bad` (weight 0),
half stay `unknown` only because the per-tenant "demotes suppressed
by floor" guard fires. Per-plane traffic spreads 5-7x because the
remaining live EVs cluster on a couple of planes by chance.

**Falsified hypotheses**:
1. *MRC config inconsistency between flows* — no, the policy is
   round-robin/weighted-CDF per packet over the per-flow EV grid;
   16/32 active is a real demotion not a structural cap.
2. *Probe-emit thundering herd* (16 senders firing 32-probe bursts
   in lockstep every 200ms saturates spine TX queues) — pacing
   `_emit_loop` to one probe per `interval/num_evs` slot plus
   per-instance startup jitter (committed; see
   `tests/test_mrc_agent_io.py::ProbePacingTests`) did not fix it.
   The lab repro after pacing is essentially identical to before.

**Still open**:
3. *Probe egress NIC contention*: every host in the ring has TWO
   `Srv6RawTransport` instances open simultaneously — one in the
   sender process (4 raw sockets bound to PLANE_NICS), one in the
   receiver process (4 more raw sockets bound to the SAME
   PLANE_NICS). SO_BINDTODEVICE is per-socket but the kernel TX
   queue is shared. Maybe contention, maybe a routing oddity when
   two processes both have raw sends out the same NIC.
4. *Probe ingress demux*: receiver listens on `::, SPRAY_PROBE_PORT`
   with SO_REUSEPORT; sender listens on `::, SPRAY_REPORT_PORT` also
   with SO_REUSEPORT. Different ports so they shouldn't fight, but
   SO_REUSEPORT load-balancing kernels-side could be a factor at
   higher scales than the existing tests exercise.
5. *Receiver probe-RX thread starvation*: each receiver runs ONE
   probe-RX thread that decodes the probe and synchronously builds
   + sends a reply via scapy outer construction. With 32 probes
   landing per round per receiver, the per-probe budget is
   ~6ms — scapy build for a 32-byte SRv6 outer typically takes
   1-3ms on alpine-on-docker-sonic-vs, so we may be at the edge.

**Diagnostic progress (session log)**:

- Single-spine tcpdump runs (p0-spine00 Ethernet0, then p2-spine00
  Ethernet0) confirmed data + replies *do* traverse the fabric
  for ring pairs, encapsulated correctly with `encap.red` outer.
  Single-spine captures CANNOT answer the real question (is
  traffic concentrated on a few EVs?) — they only confirm the
  spine being watched is carrying something.
- **µSID decoding reminder** (got this wrong twice in one
  session — don't repeat): outer `fc00:<plane>:e00L:e009:d00H::`
  on a spine's Ethernet0 is *post-spine-uN-pop*, so the leftmost
  remaining slot `e00L` is "uA from this spine toward leaf `L`",
  `e009` is "leaf uA out the host port", `d00H` is "uDT decap on
  the yellow host at leaf `H`". The spine identity is implicit
  in WHICH router you captured on, not in the µSID string.
- **ICMPv6 port-unreachable on port 9999** observed in p0-spine00
  capture — host00 sending PROBE_REPLY/LOSS_REPORT to host15:9999,
  host15's kernel returning ICMP unreachable. Six in ~150ms then
  stopped. Probably a startup race (receiver-side sender process
  not yet bound on `:::9999` when first reply arrives) or process
  teardown. **Parked as a separate issue** — not believed to be
  the cause of the 16/32 EV demotion. Revisit once main bug is
  fixed.
- **2026-05-20**: 4p-4x8 phantom-demote investigation closed (see
  RESOLVED entry below). Two stacked bugs in `loss_compute` +
  `ev_state` defaults; fixed in `d37d70e` (skip-on-no-pairing) and
  `5093246` (raise loss thresholds above straggle floor). 16/16 EVs
  on healthy fabric across green and yellow baselines confirmed.
- **2026-05-23**: Hypothesis #5 (receiver probe-RX scapy build
  budget) fixed in `200465f` (fast-path byte template + manual
  UDP6 checksum, ~10-20µs per reply vs ~2-3ms scapy build). Two
  follow-up bugs in the receiver-side prewarm path fixed in
  `4c01f7a` (missing `payload_len=` kwarg + wrong positional arg
  to `udp6_checksum_inplace`). After all three commits, the lab
  picture is **half-better**:
  - `green-all-to-all` (4p-4x8, 56 flows × 30s): **0.00% loss
    on all 56 flows, 16/16 EVs on 55/56 flows**, per-plane
    balance tight (3650-4334), one transient demote on
    `green-host05 -> host07` (15/16, p1-spine00 unused).
  - `yellow-all-to-all` (4p-4x8, 56 flows × 30s): **~0.3% loss
    average, 8-9/16 EVs per flow held only by `min_active_evs`
    floor**, per-plane spread 2× (2544-5417 between planes 1/2
    vs 0/3). The 8/16 number is the floor, not real health.
  - **Snapshot diagnostic** (after lab returned the 8/16 numbers):
    `docker exec yellow-host00 cat
    /dev/shm/srv6-mrc/yellow-host00/yellow_01.json | jq '.ev_state.tenants.yellow'`
    shows **every EV has `consecutive_probe_successes: 0` and
    `consecutive_probe_timeouts: 758-761`**. Half-good half-bad
    only because `demotes_suppressed_by_floor: 758` kept 8 EVs
    in `good` arbitrarily. Same snapshot on green showed the
    same shape — 0 successes, 5-341 timeouts, `rtt_p50_ns:
    113-138ms` on the EVs that DID have RTT history. Green's
    report looked clean because `mrc_snapshot` falls back to
    uniform weight 0.125 across the 8 floor-protected EVs,
    masking the underlying probe failure.
  - **Smoking gun**: `DEFAULT_PROBE_TIMEOUT_MS = 100`, but
    measured `rtt_p50` on green is **113-138ms** — every probe
    is timing out by construction because the timeout is shorter
    than the actual fabric RTT under load. The "fast-path"
    reply build (10-20µs) means the receiver is no longer the
    bottleneck. The new suspect is **probe EMIT** (sender side):
    `_send_encapped` still uses scapy `build_outer_packet` (~2-3ms
    per probe). At 7 dst per host × 16 EVs/round × 5 rounds/sec
    = 560 scapy builds/sec/host, the emit threads are GIL-bound
    and `mrc-reply-rx` is starved.

- **2026-05-26 cycle 16**: receiver-side ceiling + policy-specific cost
  separated via rate-sweep experiment. User ran manual matrix on
  `yellow-all-to-all` (4p-4x8, 56 flows × 30s) with varying rate and policy:
  - **ev_spray**: 20pps/50pps/60pps/70pps all **0% loss**; 80pps first sign
    of loss (~2.5% max); 100pps ~21% loss. Pins receiver-side processing
    ceiling at **~70pps × 56 flows = 3920 packets/host inbound**. This is
    a genuine fabric/host processing limit, independent of policy.
  - **mrc_snapshot**: 1pps/5pps/10pps all ~18-22% loss; **100pps ~69% loss**.
    At 10pps × 56 = 560 packets/host (7× below ev_spray's clean ceiling),
    yet still 22% lossy. **Policy adds a separate, additive cost** on top
    of whatever receiver-side ceiling exists.
  Root cause for policy cost: `MrcSnapshot.pick_ev` rebuilt `flat` list
  (16 floats) + CDF tuple on every packet (lines 603-614 in `policy.py`).
  At 100pps × 56 flows = ~700 picks/s/host, the per-packet allocation +
  `_build_cdf` call was 3-5% of per-host CPU on alpine-on-docker-sonic-vs.
  Plus GIL contention: sender pacing thread + daemon's probe-emit thread +
  daemon's reply-RX thread + snapshot refresh thread — all fighting the
  GIL across 8 Python processes per host (7 sender procs + 1 daemon).
  Fix in `0dfe48c`: cache CDF keyed by `(id(wgrid), spines)`. CDF now
  built once per (wgrid, spines) pair instead of once per packet. Cache
  invalidated on every wgrid swap so stale CDFs never survive a weight
  update. pick_ev hot path: zero allocations, just dict lookup + int arith.
  Memory: bounded by flow count × wgrid refresh cadence (negligible).
  Tests: new `TestCDFCache` pins cache population + invalidation contracts;
  full suite 564/564 pass. **Pending lab confirmation** at `mrc_snapshot @
  100pps` — if loss drops from 69% to ~21% (matching ev_spray @ same rate),
  the per-pick CDF rebuild was the answer. If it doesn't move, GIL
  contention from daemon threads is the binding constraint and the next
  move is daemon-side: reduce probe interval or batch probe emits into
  fewer wake-ups.

**Resolved sub-bugs (kept for the trail)**:
- `200465f`: fast-path probe reply via byte template + manual UDP6
  checksum. Replaces scapy in `Srv6RawTransport.send_probe_reply`.
- `4c01f7a`: fix receiver-startup crash (missing `payload_len=` in
  `_prewarm_reply_templates`) + wrong positional arg to
  `udp6_checksum_inplace` (would have produced wrong UDP csums
  silently if bug #1 hadn't crashed the receiver first). Adds
  laptop regression tests including byte-identity-vs-scapy.

**Current top hypothesis (2026-05-23)**:
Probe **emit** path (sender, scapy `build_outer_packet`) is now the
binding bottleneck — same shape as the original receiver bug, just
the other direction. Fix is symmetrical: add a probe-emit template
cache to `Srv6RawTransport`. Pre-build per `(plane, path, dst_leaf)`
at sender `__init__` when `is_sender=True`. Splice 28-byte probe
payload at `PAYLOAD_OFFSET`, fix UDP checksum, send. Expected to
drop emit cost from ~2-3ms to ~10-20µs and free the GIL for
`mrc-reply-rx` to drain replies on time. Byte-identity regression
test pattern already exists in
`tests/test_mrc_transport.py::FastPathByteIdentityTests` —
mirror it for the sender side.

**Secondary hypothesis if probe-emit fast-path is not enough**:
Per-flow `SenderMrcAgent` (one per dst per src host) duplicates
probe work. With 7 destinations per host in all-to-all, each host
runs 7 emit threads. AGENTS.md notes "Per-host MRC agent with IPC"
as future work (`daemon.py:65` comment). The daemon already
collapsed the **reply RX socket** to one per host; collapsing
the **emit thread** to one per host (probe to anycast inner_dst,
all 16 receivers reply, demux replies to the right per-dst
EVStateTable by inbound peer src) would cut emit load 7× per host
at all-to-all scale.

**Lab snapshot diagnostic commands (use these from here on)**:

```bash
# Per-EV state from one snapshot file (the // 0 guard handles
# null rtt_p50_ns on EVs that never had a successful probe):
docker exec <src_host> cat \
  /dev/shm/srv6-mrc/<src_host>/<tenant>_<dd>.json \
  | jq '.ev_state.tenants["<tenant>"] | map({
        p: .plane, s: .path, st: .state,
        ok: .consecutive_probe_successes,
        to: .consecutive_probe_timeouts,
        rtt_ms: ((.rtt_p50_ns // 0)/1000000 | floor),
        w: .weight, sup: .demotes_suppressed_by_floor
      })'

# UDP / IPv6 kernel stats — confirm whether replies are being
# delivered to userspace at all (Udp6RcvbufErrors must be 0;
# if Ip6InDelivers >> Udp6InDatagrams, replies are arriving as
# IPv6 but never becoming UDP):
docker exec <src_host> sh -c 'cat /proc/net/snmp6 | grep -E \
  "Ip6InDelivers|Ip6InDiscards|Udp6InDatagrams|Udp6RcvbufErrors"'

# Snapshot envelope shape (in case it changes again — current
# is {captured_ns, dst_id, ev_state, src_host, src_id, tenant}
# with .ev_state.tenants["<tenant>"] as a list of per-EV dicts):
docker exec <src_host> cat \
  /dev/shm/srv6-mrc/<src_host>/<tenant>_<dd>.json | jq 'keys'
```

The previous AGENTS.md note said EV records were keyed
dict-style under `.ev_state.evs`; the current shape is an
**array** under `.ev_state.tenants["<tenant>"]`. If you see
`null (null) has no keys` from jq, that's the symptom.

**2026-05-24 — multi-flow EV-counter trampling root cause**:
After `35f68f9` (probe-emit fast path) and `42965d4` (snapshot
visibility), lab cycle on `4p-4x8 green-all-to-all` showed
fast-path emit firing on every probe (`probe_fast_path_misses=0`)
and probes round-tripping into the RTT ring (`rtt_samples=24-29`
per EV), yet `consecutive_probe_successes=0` and
`consecutive_probe_timeouts≈156-216` on every EV — meaning the
state machine never observed a clean success.

Root cause: `MrcDaemon` constructed **one `EVStateTable` per
tenant** shared across all 7 per-flow `SenderMrcAgent` instances
on a sender host. The EV state machine's "consecutive success" /
"consecutive timeout" counters were designed for single-flow
semantics — flow A's success bumps `successes=1, timeouts=0`,
then flow B's timeout milliseconds later in the same shared
record bumps `timeouts=1, successes=0`. With 7 flows × 5
rounds/sec × 16 EVs = 560 events/sec/host racing into one
counter pair, `consecutive_probe_successes` stayed pegged at 0
unless 7 flows succeeded in lockstep. The `rtt_ring` path didn't
reset the counter, which is why `rtt_samples` looked healthy.

This contradicted the MRC paper's model anyway: each endpoint
maintains its own per-peer EV grid (host00 → host01 is one set
of 16 EVs, host00 → host02 is a separate 16). Per-tenant
sharing conflated unrelated paths.

Fix (`daemon.py:222`, this entry): construct one `EVStateTable`
per `(tenant, dst_id)` flow. Each `SenderMrcAgent` gets its
own table, no shared writers. Memory cost is trivial (16 EV
records × N flows). Snapshot already publishes per
`(tenant, dst_id)` so the on-disk file layout is unchanged;
only the in-memory dict key changes from `tenant` to
`(tenant, dst_id)`. Regression test:
`test_mrc_daemon_multiflow.py::test_one_ev_state_table_per_flow_not_per_tenant`
locks the contract — duplicate-table aliasing across flows will
fail loudly.

If you ever see `consecutive_probe_successes` stuck at 0 across
all flows while `rtt_samples > 0`, look for a new shared-writer
hazard against an EV record.

**2026-05-25 — cycle 13: kernel-rx dwell falsified the recvbuf-dwell hypothesis**:
After `35f68f9` (probe-emit fast path), `42965d4` (snapshot
visibility), `4570d90` (dispatch_rx_gap/backlog), `5ab8fdd` (probe-
emit buckets), `adc9b2f` (reply-handler buckets + reply_age_stats),
`ff6efb2` (kernel_rx_dwell_buckets via SO_TIMESTAMPNS), and
`02cd48a` (alpine python attribute-detection fix on the listener
side), the lab cycle on `4p-4x8 yellow-all-to-all` produced clean
SO_TIMESTAMPNS data on all senders. Result: **`kernel_rx_dwell` is
sub-millisecond for ~95% of packets, never reaches `ge_1s`, even
while `reply_age_max_ns` is 12-17s and `reply_age_avg_ns` is 7-9s.**

The 22s tail is NOT in the kernel UDP recvbuf. Six measured layers
(receiver, sender emit, sender qdisc, sender kernel-rx dwell,
sender dispatch gap/backlog, reply handler) are all sub-millisecond
under load. Yet the matched-reply age stays multi-second.

Additional sharpening from the cycle-13 data: `reply_age_count`
(~1200-1500 per flow) is only ~12-15% of `replies_received`
(~9878 per flow). So `reply_age` samples only the matched subset.
The multi-second number is per matched reply, not per arrived
packet. Combined with cycle-11's ~2% data-plane match rate, the
picture is: **most replies arrive promptly but are rejected at
the match step**; the small fraction that DO match are themselves
seconds old. The binding bottleneck is
`probe_clock.match_reply`'s `(plane, path, req_id, tx_ns)` tuple
match table under high concurrency, NOT any I/O layer.

If you see this pattern again (multi-second `reply_age_avg`,
sub-ms dwell, low matched/received ratio), the bug is in the
match path, not the recv path. Don't re-investigate kernel-rx
dwell — cycle 13 cleared it.

**Current design direction (2026-05-25, on
`feature/stateless-probes`)**:
The structural fix is to remove the match table entirely.
Stateless host-turnaround probes:

- Each host gets per-`(plane, path)` /128 unicast addresses on its
  NICs (cccc::100..::103 on eth1, ::110..::113 on eth2, etc. on
  yellow-host00; cccc:1::100..::133 on yellow-host01; etc.).
- Each leaf gets ONE `End.DT6` entry on `fc00:0:dfff::/48` (the
  probe-only uDT slot), table=main.
- Probe outer DA encodes 6-slot µSID round trip:
  `f<S> e<dst_leaf> e009 f<S> e<src_leaf> dfff`. SID list is
  consumed left-to-right by uA at each uN-hop until `dfff` lands
  on the sender's leaf which decaps and routes the inner packet
  back via its connected route to the sender's eth<plane>.
- Probe inner-dst = sender's own per-EV `/128` (e.g.
  `cccc::100`). Inner-src = `cccc::ffff` (reserved, never
  configured anywhere). Peer-host identity (`dst_id`) is in the
  probe payload (1 byte).
- The "peer" host's role in the round trip is pure IPv6
  forwarding (no userland involvement, no decap). The inner-dst
  is not locally configured on the peer, so the kernel forwards
  on the outer DA via the `fc00::/32` route.
- On return, the sender's daemon recv socket sees a byte-
  identical (modulo hop limit) copy of the original probe.
  EV identity = inner-dst extraction. `dst_id` = payload byte.
- Match table (`probe_clock.py`) is deleted entirely. No
  req_id, no tx_ns, no per-probe correspondence state. EV
  health becomes a sliding-window recv-count / sent-count
  ratio.
- Walkthrough and hand-build runbook: `docs/stateless-probes-validation.md`.

Invariants this design adds (do not violate):
- The sender's per-EV `/128` (e.g. `cccc::100`) must NEVER be
  locally configured on any host other than the owning sender.
  If a peer host accidentally gets the same /128, it claims the
  probe locally and the round trip dies silently. Generator
  enforces uniqueness; one regression test must assert no host
  has another host's per-EV address.
- `cccc::ffff` (and any other inner-src placeholder) must never
  be configured anywhere. Reserved unrouted address.
- The leaf's `dfff` `End.DT6` entry must target `table main`,
  not a tenant VRF. The decap routes the inner packet via the
  leaf's connected route to its attached host's tenant subnet,
  which lives in the global table.
- Generator-emitted leaf state for stateless-probes: one
  `dfff End.DT6` entry per leaf. Do NOT generate per-EV or per-
  host static routes on the leaf — the design's whole point is
  that no per-EV fabric state is needed.
- Hop limit budget: 8 hops round trip; default hlim 64 leaves
  56 at the sender's recv. Headroom is large but monitor if any
  future fabric path adds intermediate hops.

If validation fails (the hand-built runbook can't get a probe
back to the sender), stop and report. Do not pivot to egress-
leaf turnaround or any other fallback without user input.

**2026-05-25 — cycle 14: receiver-side SO_REUSEPORT double-bind
on (::, SPRAY_REPORT_PORT)**:
Lab validation of `feature/stateless-probes` on 4p-4x8:
- `yellow-baseline` (data plane): 0% loss, plane-balanced. PASS.
- `yellow-mrc-ev-spray` (4 sender hosts, 4 different receiver
  hosts): 0% loss, 16/16 EVs `good` on every flow,
  `window_recv/window_sent = 1.0`, zero floor suppression. PASS.
  The v4 design works exactly as intended in the
  split-sender/receiver scenario; cycle-13's multi-second
  `reply_age` and ~half-EV floor protection are fully gone.
- `yellow-all-to-all` (every host both sender and receiver):
  28.3% aggregate loss, every flow only used 8/16 EVs (planes
  0+1 starved), per-host EV state distribution split
  deterministically — half the hosts saw 16 good EVs, the
  other half saw 8 `assumed_bad` + 8 `unknown` held only by
  the floor with `total_recv=0` despite `total_sent≈158`.
  **FAIL.**

Diagnosis (lab subagent):
- `ss -lnp` on a failing host mid-run showed TWO processes bound
  to `*:9997`: the sender-process MrcDaemon AND the
  receiver-process `spray --role recv --mrc`. Both used
  SO_REUSEPORT (kernel-default for raw IPv6 sockets after the
  first bind).
- `Srv6RawTransport.__init__` unconditionally called
  `_open_udp_listener("::", SPRAY_REPORT_PORT, ...)` regardless
  of `is_sender`. The receiver path constructed via
  `ReceiverMrcAgent(...).transport = Srv6RawTransport(
  is_sender=False)` therefore double-bound the same port.
- Kernel hash-steered ~half the returning stateless probes to
  the receiver-process socket, which has no reader (the
  receiver only TX'es loss reports via per-plane raw sockets;
  it does not need an RX socket at all). Probes accumulated
  in the kernel queue while the daemon's dispatcher saw
  `window_recv=0`.
- Wire capture confirmed probes WERE round-tripping correctly
  at the kernel level: `tcpdump -nei eth1` on a "failing" host
  showed valid 6-slot uSID outer + decapped inner probes
  arriving. The packets reached the host. They landed in the
  wrong process's socket.

This is the **same class of bug** as PR #1's sender-side
SO_REUSEPORT cascade — the same lesson re-learned on the
receiver path. AGENTS.md "Hard invariant: Never bind
(::, SPRAY_REPORT_PORT) with SO_REUSEPORT more than once per
host" applied to senders only; v4's introduction of an
`is_sender=False` Srv6RawTransport on the receiver path
violated it silently.

Fix: gate `_open_udp_listener` on `is_sender=True` in
`Srv6RawTransport.__init__`. Receiver path: `_recv_sock = None`,
`recv_socket()` raises RuntimeError (no consumer exists).
Regression tests `ReceiverNoReportListenerTests.*` in
`tests/test_mrc_transport.py` pin it: receiver's
`__init__` makes zero `_open_udp_listener` calls; sender's
makes exactly one. Same commit cleans out the dead v3 vestige
tests (`FastPathByteIdentityTests`, `_reply_templates`-keyed
assertions) that referenced the removed `send_probe_reply`
path. Invariant 15 in the "Hard invariants" section codifies
the rule.

### Spurious "orphan flow" report warnings on collective scenarios

Every host in the ring scenario gets an "orphan flow" warning where
the source/dest inner addresses match the host's own send pair. The
data is delivered correctly to the real destination too; this is a
report-side false positive. Receiver process appears to count its
own outbound packets as inbound, then `report.py` doesn't find a
matching scenario flow keyed to that direction. Lower priority than
the probe-failure bug. Anycast routing was ruled out — every host
has distinct inner addresses (`cccc::2`, `cccc:1::2`, etc).

**2026-05-20 update**: PR #1 added a sniffer egress filter
(`inner_dst == self`) which addresses the most likely contributor.
Re-check on collective scenarios; if warnings persist they're a
distinct issue.

### Per-plane traffic skew on small-N scenarios

`select_spines_for_addrs` doesn't balance well across small flow
counts (e.g. 16 ring pairs). See "Things learned" above. Expected
to self-balance at all-to-all scale (240 flows); benchmark and
confirm once the probe-failure bug is fixed.

### Flaky `test_plane_loss_demotes_and_picks_shift`

`tests/test_mrc_integration.py::PlaneLossShiftsDistributionTests::test_plane_loss_demotes_and_picks_shift`
passes ~50% in isolation and in full-suite runs. Failure mode is
"expected exactly one demoted EV; got 5" — looks like a stochastic
ordering issue in the simulated event sequence rather than a real
defect. Pre-existing; not introduced by PR #1 but visible now that
the suite is otherwise clean. Worth a small follow-up before it
masks a real regression.

### RESOLVED: Phantom EV demotions on healthy 4p-4x8 baselines

**Symptom (4p-4x8 green/yellow MRC baseline runs, all flows 0% loss
with clean probes)**: 5–8 of 16 EVs per flow ended in `assumed_bad`
with `last_loss_ratio` 0.14–0.86, `consecutive_probe_timeouts: 0`,
and the demoted EVs always had dramatically fewer `per_ev_sent`
packets than their plane peers (e.g. 30–55 vs ~125).

**Root cause was two stacked bugs**:

1. **Receiver-derived `expected` fallback** (commit `d37d70e`).
   `loss_compute.apply_loss_report` fell back to the receiver's
   `rec.expected = max_seq − min_seq + 1` when no `SentWindow`
   could be paired against a `LossReport` (first 1–2 windows of a
   flow, or wall-clock skew bursts beyond `max_window_skew_ms`).
   Under packet-level EV spray that field is the **flow-global**
   seq span seen on a single EV, which is a strict and typically
   wildly inflated upper bound: `seen=10` on an EV whose seqs span
   0..400 yields a 97.5% phantom loss ratio. Two such reports
   crossed `loss_demote_consecutive` and demoted healthy EVs.
   *Fix:* skip the plane entirely when no sender-side denominator
   is available; the `fell_back_to_receiver_expected` counter is
   kept for diagnostics but now means "skipped" instead of
   "attributed via rec.expected". Wire format unchanged.

2. **Window-edge straggle** (commit `5093246`). After (1), residual
   phantom demotes still appeared in flows where one or two EVs
   had skewed `per_ev_sent`. Cause: with 16 EVs at ~370 pps/flow
   and 200ms loss windows, each EV accumulates ~5 packets per
   window. A single packet straddling a window boundary (sent in
   sender-window N but received in receiver-window N+1, or vice
   versa) shows up as ~20% apparent loss in the paired report.
   The `seen < sent` case can't be clamped — it's structurally
   indistinguishable from real loss. With the old defaults
   (`loss_threshold=0.05`, `loss_demote_consecutive=2`) two
   unlucky windows in a row tripped the demote, and the
   redistribution after demote skewed neighbor EVs' counts
   further, cascading. *Fix:* lift defaults to
   `loss_threshold=0.25`, `loss_demote_consecutive=3`. Three
   consecutive >25% windows on a healthy EV from random straggle
   is statistically negligible. Real EV failures (interface
   shutdown, spine down) produce ~100% loss on affected EVs and
   demote in `3 * loss_window_ms = 600ms`, matching the probe
   path's `3 * probe_interval_ms = 600ms` floor — neither path
   becomes the long pole.

**Lab confirmation**: post-fix re-runs of `green-mrc-baseline` and
`yellow-mrc-baseline` show 16/16 EVs across all 8 flows, 0% loss,
balanced per-plane distribution.

**Lessons / invariants worth pinning down**:
- The receiver's `expected_local = max_seq − min_seq + 1` field is
  a *strict upper bound* under packet-level spray, never a usable
  denominator. The receiver still emits it for wire compatibility
  but the sender ignores it.
- Tune loss-window thresholds to the **window-edge straggle noise
  floor**, not to the lossy-fabric SLO. `loss_threshold` lower than
  `1 / (avg_packets_per_ev_per_window)` is below the noise floor
  by construction. At 5 pkts/EV/window, anything under 20% is
  noise.
- The probe path's `probe_fail_threshold * probe_interval_ms` is
  the lower bound on detection latency for a hard EV failure;
  loss-window tuning should aim to match it, not beat it (cheap
  detection latency is bought with false positives, which cascade).


### RESOLVED: SO_REUSEPORT cascade on collective scenarios

**Symptom (4p-4x8 + 4p-8x16, every `health_aware_mrc` scenario where
every host is both sender AND receiver — `*-all-to-all`,
`*-allreduce-ring`)**: ~16 of 32 EVs per flow demoted to
`assumed_bad` despite 0% data-plane loss; per-plane traffic spreads
5–7×; the demote pattern was deterministic per-tenant.

**Root cause was three stacked bugs**, fixed in PR #1 (merged
2026-05-20). Same wire format, same scenario YAML — entirely a
host-side / orchestrator-side cure.

1. **SO_REUSEPORT reply misdelivery (the cascade)**.
   When N flows on the same src_host all ran their own
   `SenderMrcAgent`, every agent bound `(::, SPRAY_REPORT_PORT)`
   with `SO_REUSEPORT`. The Linux kernel hashes inbound replies
   across the bound socket set, so a probe reply destined for
   flow A's agent gets delivered to flow B's agent ~(N−1)/N of
   the time. B has no pending probe matching that seq → drops it
   as unknown → A's probe times out → demote.
   *Fix:* one MRC daemon process per src_host owns the single
   shared reply socket and dispatches inbound replies to per-flow
   `SenderMrcAgent` instances by peer source address (`recvfrom`
   recovers `dst_id`). Data senders no longer run their own
   agent; they read EV health from the daemon's snapshot file
   `/dev/shm/srv6-mrc/<src_host>/<tenant>_<dst_id:02d>.json`
   via the new `mrc_snapshot:<path>` policy. See
   `docs/mrc-daemon-design.md` and `srv6_mrc/mrc/daemon.py`.

2. **Sniffer egress mis-attribution**. Each receiver's per-NIC
   sniffer listens promiscuously, so on hosts that are also
   senders it captures *outbound* probe and data packets. When
   `inner_dst != self`, those captured-egress packets had been
   miscounted as "received but unexpected", inflating the orphan
   warning counter and (worse) feeding the receiver's own loss
   model with bogus arrivals. *Fix:* receiver precomputes its
   own inner address and drops captures where `inner_dst != self`
   before any further processing. New `TestSnifferEgressFilter`
   pins this.

3. **Orphan daemon accumulation across runs**. `Popen.terminate()`
   on the local `docker exec` client does **not** propagate
   SIGTERM through dockerd into the in-container `spray` process
   — the exec session detaches the child from the local client's
   signal group. Each `srctl run` therefore leaked one MRC daemon
   per src_host. Orphans accumulated, all bound to UDP/9997 with
   `SO_REUSEPORT`, so successive runs reproduced bug (1) at the
   process level: only the orphan from the active run wrote
   snapshots its own readers consumed, while N−1 orphans
   silently swallowed reply traffic. Loss climbed monotonically
   across consecutive identical runs (lab: 0% → 13% → 38% →
   60% → 75%+ over 4 runs without code changes). *Fix:*
   `mrc/run.py` daemon teardown now sends SIGTERM **inside the
   container** via `docker_exec(host, ["pkill", "-TERM", "-x",
   "spray"])` before draining the daemon's stdout. On
   `TimeoutExpired`, escalates to `pkill -KILL` in-container
   so orphans cannot survive even pathological cases. New
   `TestMrcDaemonTeardown.test_pkill_invoked_per_daemon_host_on_teardown`
   pins the contract.

**Lab confirmation (4p-4x8)**:
- `yellow-all-to-all` over 4 consecutive runs: per-plane loss
  steady at ~0.05–0.30%, no run-over-run drift.
- `docker exec yellow-host00 pgrep -x spray` returns 0 between
  runs — zero orphan daemons.
- tcpdump on `eth1` confirms traffic stops cleanly when `srctl
  run` returns.

**Invariants pinned by this episode**:
- **Never bind `(::, SPRAY_REPORT_PORT)` with `SO_REUSEPORT`
  more than once per host.** The MRC daemon is the single
  authoritative reply-socket owner per src_host. Data senders
  read snapshots, never bind the reply port.
- **Subprocess SIGTERM does not cross `docker exec`.** Any
  in-container long-lived process spawned via `docker_exec_async`
  must be torn down with an explicit `docker exec <host> pkill
  -TERM -x <name>`. `Popen.terminate()` alone leaks orphans.
- **Sniffer-based receivers must filter on `inner_dst == self`**
  on hosts that are also senders, before any accounting. Egress
  capture is unavoidable (promiscuous sockets) but trivially
  filterable once you know your own address.
- **`docker exec` stdout is unreliable for large payloads at
  container exit.** Dockerd's stdout multiplex stream silently
  drops trailing frames if the container's monitor goroutine
  observes exit before draining the stream. Symptom on
  `green-all-to-all` (8 hosts): 7 daemons produced empty stdout,
  1 produced stdout truncated at ~16 KiB (`Expecting ':' delimiter
  at char 16390`) — frame-aligned, not arbitrary truncation. Any
  in-container long-lived process whose final output exceeds a
  few KiB must write the payload to a file (e.g. `/dev/shm/...`)
  and have the orchestrator retrieve it via a second `docker exec
  cat`. The MRC daemon does this for `final_report.json`; the
  orchestrator falls back to stdout only for back-compat with
  pre-fix daemon images.
- **`docker exec cat` immediately after the previous exec
  session ends can transiently return rc=1.** Even when the file
  exists (confirmed post-hoc via `ls -la` showing the file with a
  timestamp matching the run), a fresh `docker exec <host> cat
  /path` issued within microseconds of the previous exec session
  terminating can fail with "no such file or directory". Working
  theory is dockerd exec-session teardown overlapping with the
  new exec session — the mount-namespace view is briefly
  inconsistent. Cure: retry up to 3 times with a small backoff
  (100ms suffices; the race clears within hundreds of
  microseconds in practice). The orchestrator's daemon teardown
  uses this pattern; any new code that does back-to-back
  `docker_exec_async` → drain → `docker_exec(cat ...)` on the
  same container should do the same. The failure-mode message
  on retry exhaustion includes the cat command's stderr so a
  real "file truly never written" bug is distinguishable from
  a stuck race.



- Renaming subcommands or files without sweeping `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`,
  and the relevant `docs/*.md`.
- Adding kernel-ECMP / multipath as a sender plane-selection mechanism.
- Putting plane identity anywhere other than the outer SID list.
- Reusing `e<port>` numbering instead of `e<NIC ordinal>`.
- Committing into `topologies/<name>/topology.clab.yaml` or
  `topologies/<name>/config/` directly (they're generated).
- Creating `CLAUDE.md` alongside this file. One file, this one.

## Style

- Terse, technical commit messages and PR bodies.
- Code comments: explain *why*, not *what*. Mention invariants that
  would otherwise look arbitrary.
- Don't add emojis to files or output unless asked.

## Knowledge graph (graphify)

A graphify-built knowledge graph of the repo lives under
`graphify-out/` (gitignored). Useful for "where does X connect to Y"
questions, finding code↔design-doc bridges, and auditing the
god-node neighbourhood (`EVStateTable`, `SenderMrcAgent`,
`ReceiverMrcAgent`, `MrcDaemon`, `Topology`, etc.) before refactors.

- `graphify-out/graph.html` — interactive node-level viz, open in
  any browser.
- `graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md` — god nodes, surprising
  connections, suggested questions.
- `graphify-out/graph.json` — raw graph (consumed by
  `graphify query "..."` for BFS/DFS traversal and by the MCP
  server if wired up).

Pruned artefacts the current graph deliberately collapses (every
rebuild must redo this, or the graph drowns in template noise):

1. `topologies/<topo>/config/<node>/config_db.json` — the AST
   extractor walks every JSON key. Each per-node dir is collapsed
   to one synthetic vertex (label = node name, e.g. `p0-leaf00`),
   with a `Topology <name>` root vertex containing them via
   `contains` edges. Saves ~44k noise nodes on a 4p-4x8 + 4p-8x16
   pair.
2. `generators/sonic_vs_port_table.json` — config-generator
   template, same key-explosion pattern. Collapsed to a single
   `sonic_vs_port_table.json (template)` vertex. ~225 noise
   nodes.

Both pruned subgraphs were verified to have **zero bridge edges**
to the MRC code subgraph before collapse, so no signal was lost.

If you regenerate the graph and add new JSON data templates under
`generators/` or new topology variants under `topologies/`, apply
the same prune (see `graphify-out/cost.json` for the prior run's
manifest; the prune logic itself was ad-hoc Python over
`graph.json`, not yet codified — TODO: ship a
`scripts/graphify_prune.py` so the cleanup is repeatable).

The graph's audit trail (EXTRACTED vs INFERRED edges) is
trustworthy with one known caveat: the AST extractor emits
`confidence=INFERRED, confidence_score=0.5, relation=uses` for
plain class references that should be EXTRACTED. Filter these out
when reading "INFERRED edge count" warnings — only edges with
`confidence_score >= 0.55` are genuine LLM-reasoned guesses.

## Quick-start verification

After any change touching addressing / SID shape / routing:

```
make image                                                   # one image serves every topology
make regen                                                   # generate topo + configs
make deploy                                                  # containerlab deploy
make config                                                  # push SONiC configs (auto-verifies + repairs)
make host-routes                                             # full-mesh per-tenant host kernel routes
make scenario SCEN=green-mrc-baseline                        # green tenant baseline (MRC)
make scenario SCEN=yellow-baseline                           # yellow tenant baseline (round_robin)

docker exec -d yellow-host07 spray --role recv
docker exec yellow-host00 spray --role send \
    --dst-id 7 --rate 1000pps --duration 4s
```

`spray` recv (foreground variant) should show roughly balanced counts
across 4 planes.

`make config` will print a "Verifying leaf tier" section at the end
that confirms every leaf has the expected number of `seg6local`
entries in the kernel FIB (expected count is derived from each node's
generated `frr.conf`, so it works for any topology + tenant mix).
Mismatched leaves are auto-re-pushed up to `VERIFY_RETRIES` times
(default 3). If you ever suspect a leaf is mis-programmed without
re-deploying, run `make verify-config` for a read-only check that
also repairs.

For MRC end-to-end:

```
make scenario SCEN=green-mrc-baseline    # green tenant, MRC enabled, no faults
make scenario SCEN=yellow-baseline       # yellow tenant, round_robin, no faults
make scenario SCEN=green-mrc-plane-loss  # 1% loss on plane 2 + MRC demote
make scenario SCEN=green-mrc-plane-latency  # plane 2 +5ms + MRC (RTT not yet a demote signal)

# Health-aware MRC variants (turn the agents on):
make scenario SCEN=green-mrc-baseline     # clean fabric + MRC; should match baseline
make scenario SCEN=green-mrc-plane-loss   # 5% loss on plane 2 + MRC; loss should
                                          # drop well below round_robin after demote
make scenario SCEN=green-mrc-plane-latency # 10ms on plane 3 + MRC; currently no
                                          # demote (RTT not a signal yet)
make scenario SCEN=green-mrc-ev-spray     # per-EV sender control (green)
make scenario SCEN=yellow-mrc-ev-spray    # per-EV sender control (yellow)
```

Expect ~0% loss on baselines, balanced per-plane counts, low
`max_reorder_distance`. Yellow's per-flow `reord` is a bit higher
than green's (extra host-side decap stage adds scheduling jitter)
but loss and balance are identical. On the green-mrc-* runs, look in
the per-flow JSON for `per_plane_sent` to confirm the demotion shifted
traffic off the affected plane.
