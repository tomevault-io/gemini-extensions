# CLAUDE.md — okto-pulse

This file gives Claude (and humans) what they need to operate this repo.
Project overview lives in `README.md`; this file is for procedures.

This repo is the deliverable: CLI, embedded frontend, Dockerfile, and the
release pipeline. It depends on `okto-pulse-core` (a sibling repo) for the
actual engine.

---

## Docker architecture

The deployable artifact is a single image: `ghcr.io/oktolabsai/okto-pulse:<tag>`.
Everything else (compose files, wheels, attestations) is produced from this repo
plus the `okto-pulse-core` sibling.

### Multi-stage Dockerfile

```
python:3.12-slim
    │
    ├─ base                  apt deps + python env
    │
    ├─ wheel-builder         COPY okto-pulse/ + okto-pulse-core/ (siblings)
    │                        → python -m build → /wheels/*.whl
    │   ↓
    ├─ local-install         COPY pyprojects + uv.lock → uv pip install
    │                        --frozen → /wheels/*.whl on top
    │   ↓
    └─ local-runtime         pre-download all-MiniLM-L6-v2,
                             verify model cache presence, EXPOSE 8100/8101,
                             HEALTHCHECK, CMD ["okto-pulse", "serve"]
    │
    ├─ pypi-install          uv pip install okto-pulse==${OKTO_PULSE_VERSION}
    │   ↓
    └─ pypi-runtime          same finalizer as local-runtime
```

Two **independent finalizer paths** (`local-runtime`, `pypi-runtime`) so dev and
prod don't share an install layer that could mask a publishing bug. They emit
the same runtime contract: ports 8100/8101, `okto-pulse serve` as PID 1, healthcheck on
`/api/v1/kg/settings`, model cache at `/opt/hf-cache`.

### Compose files

| File | Target | Build context | When to use |
|------|--------|----------------|-------------|
| `docker-compose.yml` | `local-runtime` | `..` (parent of `okto-pulse/`) | Hacking on `okto-pulse-core/` and `okto-pulse/` together. Wheels built from local source. |
| `docker-compose.prod.yml` | `pypi-runtime` | `.` | Pulling a pinned `okto-pulse==X.Y.Z` from PyPI. No sibling repo needed. |

Both bind host ports to `127.0.0.1` only and set `HOST=0.0.0.0` /
`MCP_HOST=0.0.0.0` inside the container so port-mapping actually reaches the
listeners. (Without those env vars, uvicorn binds to the container's loopback
interface and Docker's port mapping silently produces "Connection reset by peer"
on the host side.)

### Why the sibling-checkout pattern

The `local-runtime` target needs both repos at the same commit/tag so an image
built in CI is reproducible from source. The release pipeline does sibling
checkouts of `okto-pulse-core@vX.Y.Z` and `okto-pulse@vX.Y.Z`, sets the build
context to the parent directory, and the Dockerfile's `wheel-builder` stage
`COPY`s both into `/src/`. The `okto-pulse/pyproject.toml` dep pin
(`okto-pulse-core>=X.Y.Z,<1.0.0`) is a floor for the PyPI install path; it does
NOT control which core source is built into the local-runtime image.

### Env vars the runtime reads

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | API/UI uvicorn bind host. Read by `CommunitySettings.host` (pydantic-settings, no prefix). |
| `MCP_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | MCP uvicorn bind host. Read by `community/main.py` (since v0.1.12) AND `core/mcp/server.py:run_mcp_server()` standalone. |
| `DATA_DIR` | `~/.okto-pulse` | SQLite + KG root. Set to `/data` in compose. |
| `KG_BASE_DIR` | derived from `DATA_DIR` | Per-board graph storage. |
| `HF_HOME` | `~/.cache/huggingface` | Pre-warmed to `/opt/hf-cache` in the image. |
| `MCP_PORT` / API port | from CLI flags or `settings.mcp_port` / `settings.port` | Override port numbers without remapping in compose. |
| `MCP_TRACE_ENABLED` | unset | `=1` records every MCP call to `${MCP_TRACE_DIR}/session_*.jsonl`. |
| `MCP_TRACE_DIR` | `${KG_BASE_DIR}/mcp_traces` | Trace output directory when tracing is enabled; falls back to `./mcp_traces` when `KG_BASE_DIR` is unset. |

**MCP_HOST runtime path gotcha:** there are TWO uvicorn callers in the codebase.
`okto-pulse-core/.../mcp/server.py:run_mcp_server()` is only used when running
the MCP server standalone (`python -m okto_pulse.core.mcp.server`). The
deployed container runs `okto-pulse serve`, which uses the dual-port runner in
`okto-pulse/src/okto_pulse/community/main.py`. Both honor `MCP_HOST` since
v0.1.12 — but pre-v0.1.12 only the standalone path did. If anyone backports
older releases, watch for the regression: setting `MCP_HOST=0.0.0.0` would do
nothing inside the container.

### Healthcheck

```
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=5s --start-period=20s --retries=3 \
    CMD curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:8100/api/v1/kg/settings || exit 1
```

The healthcheck curls **inside the container** so it always uses 127.0.0.1
even when the public binding is 0.0.0.0. A container can be `healthy` but
unreachable from the host if the listener bound to 127.0.0.1 (uvicorn loopback
inside container ≠ Docker's NAT loopback). Always check the uvicorn startup
line in `docker logs` when "container healthy + curl fails from host":

```
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8100   ← reachable
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8100 ← NOT reachable from host
```

### Local Docker dry-run

To replicate the release pipeline's smoke build locally (sibling layout, build
context = workspace root):

```bash
cd ..                         # workspace root holding both repos
docker build \
  -f okto-pulse/Dockerfile \
  --target local-runtime \
  -t pulse:dev \
  .

docker run --rm -d --name pulse-dev \
  -e HOST=0.0.0.0 \
  -e MCP_HOST=0.0.0.0 \
  -p 18100:8100 -p 18101:8101 \
  pulse:dev
docker logs -f pulse-dev   # ctrl-c when "Startup complete"
curl -fsS http://localhost:18100/api/v1/kg/settings
docker rm -f pulse-dev
```

Use `--platform=linux/amd64` on Apple Silicon — the image is amd64-only.

## Releasing a new version

The pipeline is **tag-driven**. Pushing a `vX.Y.Z` git tag to this repo
triggers `.github/workflows/release.yml`, which runs gates and publishes a
Docker image to GitHub Container Registry.

- Image: `ghcr.io/oktolabsai/okto-pulse` (public, no auth needed to pull)
- Pipeline runtime: ~9 min on first run, faster afterwards (Buildx cache)
- Branches are working space; the **tag is the release event**

### Release procedure (in order)

1. **Bump version in BOTH repos**. Three files total — `okto-pulse-core/pyproject.toml`,
   `okto-pulse/pyproject.toml`, and `okto-pulse/Dockerfile` (the `ARG OKTO_PULSE_VERSION`
   line). The pin in `okto-pulse/pyproject.toml` (`okto-pulse-core>=X.Y.Z,<1.0.0`)
   does not need to be touched unless you want to raise the floor.

2. **Commit and push to your working branch in both repos.** Both must be at
   their bumped commit on the remote before tagging.

3. **Tag and push okto-pulse-core FIRST** — required by the release workflow's
   preflight:

   ```bash
   cd okto-pulse-core
   git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Release X.Y.Z"
   git push origin vX.Y.Z
   ```

4. **Tag and push okto-pulse SECOND** — this triggers the pipeline:

   ```bash
   cd okto-pulse
   git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Release X.Y.Z"
   git push origin vX.Y.Z
   ```

5. **Watch the run**:

   ```bash
   gh run watch -R OktoLabsAI/okto-pulse
   ```

If you tag pulse first, the preflight fails fast with a copy-pasteable fix
command. Don't try to "fix forward" by tagging core after — the workflow
won't re-run on a non-tag event. Bump and re-tag (see Recovery below).

### What the pipeline does

Triggered by `push: tags: ['v*.*.*']`. Single job, single runner (`ubuntu-latest`,
Python 3.12). All gates must pass before any image is pushed:

1. Extract version from tag (`vX.Y.Z` → `X.Y.Z`)
2. Preflight: confirm `okto-pulse-core` has the matching `vX.Y.Z` tag
3. Sibling-checkout both repos at the tag (workspace root holds both as siblings)
4. Verify `pyproject.toml` versions in both repos match the git tag
5. Install `okto-pulse-core` in editable mode + replay/test deps
6. Set up Buildx + log in to GHCR (uses built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN`, no PAT)
7. Compute image tags via `docker/metadata-action`
8. Build image (`target=local-runtime`, `load: true` — into local daemon, not pushed)
9. Spin up container, poll `docker inspect ... .State.Health.Status` until `healthy` (max 120s)
10. Extract bootstrap API key (`dash_<hex>`) from container logs
11. Run vendored `mcp_replay.py` against the long trace fixture (862 events,
    `--behavioral --no-strict`)
12. **Replay gate**: scan container logs for `sigbus|sigsegv|segmentation|bus error|ResourceWarning|RuntimeError.*Failed to open`,
    confirm container is still `healthy`
13. Push to GHCR with semver tags: `:X.Y.Z`, `:X.Y`, `:latest`, `:sha-<short>`
14. Cleanup container (always, even on failure)
15. Job summary with pull command

### Image tags published per release

For tag `v0.1.11`:

| Tag | Mutability | Use |
|-----|-----------|-----|
| `:0.1.11` | immutable | exact pin (recommended for prod) |
| `:0.1` | mutable | minor track — picks up future `0.1.x` patches |
| `:latest` | mutable | floating |
| `:sha-b74923a` | immutable | hard SHA pin (for forensic / debugging) |

### Verifying a release

**Smoke check** (does it boot?):

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/oktolabsai/okto-pulse:X.Y.Z
docker run -d --name pulse-verify -p 8100:8100 -p 8101:8101 \
    ghcr.io/oktolabsai/okto-pulse:X.Y.Z
sleep 30
curl -fsS http://localhost:8100/api/v1/kg/settings  # should 200
docker rm -f pulse-verify
```

**Signature check** (was this image really built by our release pipeline?):

```bash
cosign verify ghcr.io/oktolabsai/okto-pulse:X.Y.Z \
  --certificate-identity-regexp 'https://github.com/OktoLabsAI/okto-pulse/.*' \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer 'https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com'
```

The signature is keyless — issued by Sigstore Fulcio against the GitHub
Actions OIDC token of the workflow run that built the image. A valid
signature proves the image came out of THIS workflow on a tagged commit.

**Inspect the SBOM and SLSA provenance** (what's inside / how was it built?):

```bash
cosign download attestation ghcr.io/oktolabsai/okto-pulse:X.Y.Z \
  --predicate-type slsaprovenance
cosign download attestation ghcr.io/oktolabsai/okto-pulse:X.Y.Z \
  --predicate-type cyclonedx
```

If `docker pull` returns 401, the package was created with default-private
visibility on its first push. Flip it at
https://github.com/orgs/OktoLabsAI/packages/container/okto-pulse/settings
("Danger Zone" → Change package visibility → Public).

### Recovery — when the pipeline fails

This repo has a tag-protection ruleset (`Protect release tags v*`) that
blocks tag deletion, force-update, and non-fast-forward. **Tags are
immutable.** Do not try to delete or move them — the API will 422.

If the pipeline fails at any gate:

1. Diagnose with `gh run view --log-failed --job=<id> -R OktoLabsAI/okto-pulse`
2. Fix in code or workflow
3. **Bump the patch version** (e.g. `0.1.11` → `0.1.12`) in both repos
4. Re-run the procedure above

The protection is correct hygiene — failed tags stay in the history as a
record of what didn't ship. Don't try to bypass the ruleset for a clean log;
bump and move forward.

### Known caveats

- **No pytest gate in the workflow.** The `okto-pulse-core` test suite has
  pre-existing post-Ladybug failures, notably `test_close_releases_handles`
  which reproducibly leaks `graph.kuzu` + `graph.kuzu.wal` file handles on
  Linux (real bug in `BoardConnection.close()`, not a CI flake). The smoke
  test + MCP replay gates cover deployability today. Reinstate pytest in
  `release.yml` once the kg layer's `close()` is fixed for Linux.

- **Trace fixture must contain `create_ideation` events.** The replay
  tool's `clean_golden_path` skips everything before the first
  `create_ideation`. The vendored `session_long.jsonl` (~2.6 MB, 862 events)
  has 42 of them. A trimmed-down trace without one will filter to zero and
  fail the smoke step with `No entries to replay after filtering`.

- **Replay tool's exit code is advisory.** The tool exits 0 unless the
  trace is unparseable. The actual gate is the log scan + health check
  that runs after the replay step.

- **First push of a new image to GHCR creates a private package.** Flip
  visibility manually once (see "Verifying a release" above). Subsequent
  pushes inherit the visibility.

- **Cross-repo checkout uses `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN`.** Works because both
  repos are public. If either goes private, add a fine-grained PAT and
  swap the `token:` parameter in `release.yml` checkout steps.

## Local development

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"

okto-pulse init
okto-pulse serve     # API+frontend :8100, MCP :8101
okto-pulse status
okto-pulse reset

pytest -q
pytest tests/test_specific.py::test_name -v
```

`okto-pulse serve` requires no LLM keys. The image bundles
`all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (sentence-transformers) for kg embeddings; downloads at
build time so the runtime is offline-capable.

---

## CI workflows in this repo

- `.github/workflows/release.yml` — tag-driven release (above)
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — PR + main: pytest gate is currently dropped
  (same caveat as release); runs build verify on the Dockerfile to catch
  Dockerfile/dep regressions before tagging
- `.github/workflows/cla.yml` — CLA signing, do not touch

## Out of scope (deliberately)

- Auto-deploy to Portainer or any production host (deploy stays manual)
- Multi-arch builds (amd64 only; add arm64 only when there's a real consumer)
- Cross-run buildx cache (`type=gha`) — current build is fast enough
- Auto-tag on green main commits — defer until trunk-based discipline exists
