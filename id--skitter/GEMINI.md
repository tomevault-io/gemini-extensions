## Architecture in One Paragraph

Clients publish JSON-RPC requests to `$a2a/v1/request/{org}/{unit}/{agent_id}`. Any A2A-over-MQTT compliant agent can handle requests; skitter ships an agent-runner as a convenience for wrapping CLI tools, but it's not required. For composed apps, the coordinator subscribes to the app's request topic, creates a DB-backed session, and dispatches A2A requests to individual agents. The coordinator only sends A2A requests and collects replies and doesn't care how agents are implemented. Locally: agents + Docker EMQX.

## Key Concepts

- **SKITTER_HOME.** All config and agent definitions live under `~/.skitter/` by default. Override with `SKITTER_HOME` env var or `--skitter-home` CLI flag.
- **Immutable sessions.** Persisted once by coordinator in DB, never mutated. Per-task status tracked separately.
- **Namespace separation.** `$a2a/v1/...` for client-facing A2A protocol (request, reply, discovery, events).
- **Native sub-agents.** Agent identity owned by the external runtime (Claude Code or Codex). Skitter reads metadata from definition files (`~/.skitter/agents/*.md`, `~/.skitter/agents/*.toml`); the agent-runner passes system instructions directly to the CLI tool and streams results back over MQTT.
- **Skills.** Reusable instruction modules stored in `~/.skitter/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (YAML frontmatter with name/description, followed by instructions). Agent definitions reference skills by name via `skills: [name1, name2]` in frontmatter. At startup, the agent-runner symlinks referenced skills into the runtime-native path (`.claude/skills/` for Claude Code, `.agents/skills/` for Codex) inside the agent's resource directory, and sets `cwd` so the runtime discovers them natively. Skills are shared across agents.
- **Independent agents.** Agents are any A2A-over-MQTT compliant process. The coordinator doesn't spawn or manage them.
- **Session continuity.** Both Claude Code and Codex agents support multi-turn conversations via A2A `context_id`. The agent-runner captures the CLI-native session ID (`session_id` from Claude, `thread_id` from Codex) on the first request and maps it to the A2A `context_id`. Subsequent requests with the same `context_id` use `--resume <session_id>` for Claude or `codex exec resume <thread_id>` for Codex. On resume, Claude skips `--permission-mode` and `--settings` (inherited from the original session). Apps also support conversation continuity: the coordinator loads prior completed sessions for the same `(app_id, context_id)` and injects conversation history into task prompts.
- **A2A protocol compliance.** All protocol-facing code must conform to A2A v1.0.0 and the A2A-over-MQTT v0.1 binding. Local copies of the specs live in `docs/spec/`. Use `/a2a-compliance` to validate after protocol changes.

## Command Model

| Category | Runs where | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| **Local CLI** | Host process, no containers needed | `setup`, `create-agent`, `doctor`, `list-agents`, `list-apps` |
| **Service management** | Host process, manages Docker containers | `up`, `down`, `status`, `logs` |
| **A2A client** | Host process, talks to running services over MQTT | `ask` (primary), `chat`, `request`, `create-app`, `cancel-session` |

## Writing Style

- **Avoid em-dashes.** Use colons, semicolons, periods, commas, or parentheses instead. Only use em-dashes where no other punctuation works naturally (very rare). Never use double-dashes.

## Planning and Implementation Process

For non-trivial requests (new features, architectural changes, multi-file refactors):

### 1. Planning Phase
- **Use a team of agents** for planning. Delegate research and analysis to subagents.
- **Evaluate fit.** Research whether the request aligns with skitter's goals (minimal MQTT-based coordinator, independent agents, small codebase). Push back if a request conflicts with core principles or adds unnecessary complexity.
- **Persist the plan.** Write a markdown file under `docs/` with timestamp: `docs/YYYY-mm-DD-HH-MM-SS-<slug>.md`.

### 2. Implementation Phase
- **Coding persona.** Professional senior Python developer. Idiomatic, neat Python. No boilerplate or unnecessary abstractions.
- **Tests.** Cover new/changed functionality with focused tests. Test edge cases, not obvious behavior. When fixing a bug, always add a regression test that fails without the fix and passes with it.
- **No backward compatibility.** Rewrite and drop old code freely. No shims, re-exports, or deprecation warnings.

### 3. Quality Phase
1. **`/simplify`**: run the simplify skill. Fix all findings.
2. **Staff-engineer review**: run the `staff-engineer` agent. Fix all findings.
3. **Lint and format**: `uvx ruff format` and `uvx ruff check` on changed files.
4. **Unit tests**: `uv run pytest tests/unit/ -q`.
5. **E2E tests**: `docker compose up -d --wait && uv run pytest tests/test_e2e.py -v -s`. Always run E2E tests together with unit tests; do not skip them.
5b. **Docker E2E tests** (optional; needs real auth in `.env.test`): `docker compose --env-file .env.test -f docker-compose.test.yml up -d --wait --build && uv run pytest tests/test_docker_e2e.py -v -s`. Exercises real Claude/Codex CLIs in Docker. Tests skip gracefully when auth tokens are absent.
6. **A2A compliance**: if protocol-facing code changed, run `/a2a-compliance`.
7. **Dashboard**: verify `dashboard.html` still works if session state or topics changed.
8. **Docs and env files**: update `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `docs/architecture.md`, `.env.example`, and `.env.cloud.example` if behavior, config, env vars, or CLI usage changed.

## Limitations

- Agent runners use `--permission-mode auto` with filesystem sandbox (write restricted to `/tmp`)
- No built-in authentication (rely on broker auth)
- Single coordinator per broker (enforced via retained MQTT lock)
- No timeout for coordinator-dispatched tasks (only recovery tasks get 120s timeout); requester-side `send_and_wait` has retry/timeout profile
- Codex `.toml` agent definitions: `model` and `developer_instructions` are applied at runtime via CLI flags; other fields (`sandbox_mode`, etc.) are not passed to `codex exec` (always uses `--full-auto`)
- A2A-over-MQTT: Core Conformance only; Extended Conformance features (shared pool dispatch, task handover, binary artifacts, UBSP, broker-managed status, OAuth) are not implemented
