## Project Overview

**Shadcn Dashboard Free** is a client-side admin dashboard SPA built with:

- **Framework**: Vite 8 + React 19 (no server framework — pure client-side SPA)
- **Language**: TypeScript, compiled with `tsc` before every build
- **Routing**: `react-router` (client-side, `createBrowserRouter`)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4
- **UI Components**: shadcn-style primitives on Base UI (`@base-ui/react`)
- **Forms**: no form library currently wired up (`react-hook-form`/`zod`/`@hookform/resolvers` were removed as unused — reintroduce if a form feature actually needs them)
- **Data fetching / mocking**: `swr` for fetching, `msw` for mocked API responses
- **Charts**: `recharts` (the only charting library in the project)
- **Icons**: `lucide-react` and `@iconify/react` are the two icon packages in use
- **Deployment**: static `dist/` build served via Netlify redirect (`netlify.toml`) or Docker + nginx (`Dockerfile`, `nginx.conf`)
- **Package Manager**: npm (`package-lock.json` is the lockfile of record)

There is no backend in this repo. All "API" calls go through mock handlers (`msw`) backed by static data in `src/api/*/**-data.ts`.

## Build & Development Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Development server (http://localhost:5173)
npm run dev

# Type-check + production build
npm run build

# Preview the production build
npm run preview

# Lint (ESLint, must pass with zero warnings)
npm run lint
```

`npm run build` runs `tsc` before `vite build` — TypeScript errors fail the build, not just lint. Always run `npm run lint` before considering frontend changes done.

---

## Routing Pattern

All routes are declared in `src/routes/Router.tsx` using `react-router`'s `createBrowserRouter`. Every page component is:

1. Lazily imported with `lazy(() => import('../views/...'))`
2. Wrapped in `Loadable` (`src/layouts/full/shared/loadable/Loadable.tsx`) to provide a suspense fallback

When adding a new page:

1. Create the view under `src/views/<area>/<page>/index.tsx` (or similar), following sibling folders.
2. Add a `Loadable(lazy(() => import(...)))` declaration near related routes in `Router.tsx`.
3. Add the route entry under the appropriate layout (`FullLayout` for dashboard pages, `BlankLayout` for auth/error pages).
4. If the page needs a sidebar entry, wire it into the sidebar nav data (check `src/layouts/full/vertical/sidebar/` for the existing pattern).

---

## Data & Mocking Pattern

This project has no real backend — follow the existing mock pattern rather than adding real endpoints:

1. Static mock data lives in `src/api/<feature>/<feature>-data.ts`.
2. MSW request handlers per feature are combined in `src/api/mocks/handlers/mock-handlers.ts`.
3. Components/contexts fetch via `swr` using the shared fetchers in `src/api/global-fetcher.ts` (`getFetcher`, `postFetcher`, `putFetcher`).
4. Feature state (e.g. blog posts, notes, tickets) is exposed through a dedicated context in `src/context/<feature>-context/`, which wraps the SWR call and exposes state + setters.

When adding a new feature that needs data, mirror the blog/notes/ticket pattern: mock data file → MSW handler → context provider → view/components consuming the context.

## Component & Styling Conventions

- **Icons**: check which icon package the file you're editing already imports before adding icons — `lucide-react` and `@iconify/react` (`import { Icon } from '@iconify/react'`) are the two in use.
- **UI primitives**: `src/components/ui/` holds the shadcn-style primitives (Base UI wrapped with `cva` + `cn()`). Extend these via composition in feature components rather than editing the primitives directly, unless the change is meant to apply globally.
- **Styling**: Tailwind v4 utility classes; use `cn()` from `src/lib/utils.ts` for conditional/merged class names — never string-concatenate classes.
- **Forms**: no form library is currently installed; if a feature needs one, discuss with the user before adding a dependency.
- **Tables**: use TanStack Table via the wrappers in `src/components/tables/` (e.g. `DataTable.tsx`) rather than building a table from scratch.
- **Charts**: use `recharts` via `src/components/ui/chart.tsx`.

---

## TypeScript & Path Aliases

- Both `src/*` and `@/*` alias to `./src/*` (see `vite.config.ts` and `tsconfig.json`). Existing files use a mix of `src/...` and `@/...` imports — match whichever convention the file you're editing already uses.
- `npm run build` type-checks the whole project with `tsc` first; don't rely on Vite dev-server transpilation alone to catch type errors.

---

## Linting

ESLint config is `.eslintrc.cjs` (legacy config format, not flat config):

- Extends `eslint:recommended`, `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended`, `plugin:react-hooks/recommended`
- `react-refresh/only-export-components` is a warning
- `npm run lint` runs with `--max-warnings 0` — treat warnings as build-breaking

---

## Deployment

- **Netlify**: `netlify.toml` redirects all paths to `/index.html` for SPA routing — already configured, no changes usually needed.


---

## Notes for AI Agents

1. **Verify feature claims against code, not the dependency list.** Grep `src/` before telling the user a feature exists.
2. **This is a client-only SPA** — there are no server actions, API routes, or server components. All "backend" behavior is MSW-mocked.
3. **Match existing import conventions** — check sibling files in `views`/`components` for path alias style (`src/...` vs `@/...`) and icon package before adding new code.
4. **Icons**: prefer `lucide-react` or `@iconify/react`, matching whichever the file already uses.
5. **Mock data first** — new features should follow the mock-data + MSW-handler + context pattern in `src/api/`, not fetch a real endpoint, unless one already exists.
6. **Package manager is npm** — use `npm install`/`npm run <script>`; don't reintroduce pnpm/yarn/bun lockfiles or commands.
7. **Type errors block the build** — `npm run build` runs `tsc` before `vite build`, so don't leave `any`-typed shortcuts assuming the dev server alone will catch problems.
8. **Lint must be clean** — `npm run lint` uses `--max-warnings 0`; fix warnings, don't suppress them with disable comments unless justified.
