# CLAUDE.md — xgecu-gui

A Qt6 / C++ Debian GUI for the XGecu **T48 / T56 / TL866II+** universal device programmers, built on top of the open-source [minipro](https://gitlab.com/DavidGriffith/minipro) library.

Released tag: **`v0.6.0`**. Verified end-to-end against a real T48 + Microchip-fab AT27C256 (UV-EPROM): read → save → load → verify → write → auto-verify round-trip works, and against an ATmega328P (fuse read + a live CKDIV8 write round-trip). Feature history: v0.2.0 fuse/config editor + copy-address; v0.3.0 Preferences (themes/fonts); v0.4.0 programmer-aware ZIF + write-dialog voltages; v0.5.0 HEX/S-record I/O + offset-merge + move + split/combine + serial numbers; v0.5.1 menu reorg; v0.6.0 mass-production mode + serial preview + chip-category filter + NAND/eMMC/VGA Windows-only.

## Layout

- `src/core/` — non-Qt-Widgets logic: `Programmer` + `ProgrammerWorker` (on a dedicated `QThread`), `ChipDatabase`, `BufferModel` (with dirty tracking + `dirtyChanged` signal), `FileFormat` (HEX/S-record/binary decode-encode + split/combine transforms), `SerializationConfig` (serial-number production).
- `src/ui/` — Qt widgets: `MainWindow`, `ChipSelectDialog`, `ZifSocketView`, `HexView`, `FuseEditorWidget`, `PreferencesDialog`, `SerializationDialog`, plus `Theme`/`ThemeManager` (appearance).
- `third_party/minipro/` — **git submodule** of `https://gitlab.com/DavidGriffith/minipro.git`, pinned. Clone with `--recurse-submodules`.
- `scripts/merge_chip_lists.py` — combines `third_party/minipro/infoic.xml` + `../T48_List.txt` into `data/chips_merged.json`.
- `data/chips_merged.json` — generated chip catalog (~9 MB raw; gets Qt-resource-compressed in the binary). Committed for now so building doesn't require running the merge first.
- `tests/` — Qt Test unit tests (`test_chip_database`, `test_buffer_model`, `test_file_format` — HEX/S-record round-trips incl. >64K ELA, split/combine transforms, serial render/patch/persist).
- `tests/live/test_live_programmer.cpp` — live-hardware smoke tests, each method `QSKIP`s unless `XGECU_LIVE_TESTS=1`. The default `ctest` run stays green without hardware.
- `debian/` — packaging (`control`, `rules`, `changelog`, `copyright`, `source/format`, `postinst`, `postrm`). `dpkg-buildpackage -b -us -uc` builds the `.deb` into the parent dir. `debian/rules` uses `--buildsystem=cmake+ninja` (configure AND build via Ninja — don't reintroduce a bare `-GNinja` under the plain `cmake` buildsystem, which makes debhelper run `make` against a Ninja build dir and fail). Runtime deps are auto-filled by `dh_shlibdeps`; the dbgsym package is a normal side-product.
- `packaging/xgecu-gui.desktop` — application launcher.
- `packaging/xgecu-gui.svg` — stylised DIP-package icon.

## Build

Out-of-source build, Ninja generator:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules <repo> xgecu-gui && cd xgecu-gui
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -r scripts/requirements.txt
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja
cmake --build build
./build/xgecu-gui
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure              # unit + skipped live
XGECU_LIVE_TESTS=1 ./build/tests/test_live_programmer   # active live run
```

The minipro static library is built via its own Makefile, invoked from CMake (`add_custom_command` → `make -C third_party/minipro library` via the resolved absolute GNU `make` path, not `${CMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM}` since Ninja won't drive minipro's Makefile). Linker pulls in `libusb-1.0` and `zlib` via `pkg-config`.

`cmake --install build --prefix /usr` (or `DESTDIR=…` for staging) lays the binary down under `/usr/bin/`, the bundled `infoic.xml` / `logicic.xml` under `/usr/share/xgecu-gui/`, the `.desktop` + `.svg` icon in the standard XDG paths, and minipro's udev rules under `/usr/lib/udev/rules.d/`.

## Hardware

`lsusb` shows `a466:0a53 "TL866II Plus Device Programmer [MiniPRO]"` — that VID/PID is **shared between TL866II+, T48, and T56**. The actual model is determined post-handshake by minipro and lives in `minipro_handle_t::version` (`MP_T48 = 7`). The dev machine has a real **T48** plugged in (verified with `minipro -k`).

USB access on Debian 13: user must be in `plugdev` AND the minipro udev rules must be installed (from `third_party/minipro/udev/`; or installed system-wide by the `.deb`). The current dev machine has them in place — `/dev/bus/usb/.../<dev>` carries a `user:xecaz:rw-` ACL via `61-minipro-uaccess.rules`.

## Threading

**All `minipro_*` calls are blocking and must NEVER run on the GUI thread.** A dedicated `QThread` owns `ProgrammerWorker`, which holds the `minipro_handle_t*` for the lifetime of the connection. Communication is exclusively via queued signals/slots.

The worker API is **`MemArea`-parametric** (Code/Data):

- Slots: `setInfoicPath`, `setLogicicPath`, `detect`, `openChip`, `readMemory(area)`, `verifyMemory(area, expected)`, `writeMemory(area, data, force, autoVerify)`, `eraseChip(force)`, `detectChipId`, `readFuses`, `writeFuses(FuseSet)`.
- Signals: `detected(DeviceInfo)`, `chipOpened(name, codeSize, dataSize, canErase)`, `progress(done, total)`, `readFinished(ReadResult{area, data})`, `verifyFinished(VerifyResult{area, …})`, `writeFinished(WriteResult{area, …})`, `chipIdFinished`, `eraseFinished`, `fusesAvailable(FuseSet)`, `fusesRead(FuseSet)`, `fuseWriteFinished(ok, verified, msg)`, `chipVoltages(ChipVoltages)`, `error`.

`MemArea::Code` maps to `MP_CODE`, `MemArea::Data` maps to `MP_DATA`. The word-organised address shift (`flags.data_org == MP_ORG_WORDS`) **only applies to code memory** — `verifyMemory` and `writeMemory` deliberately gate it on `area == MemArea::Code`.

Cancellation is cooperative: a `std::atomic<bool>` checked between minipro block I/O calls. Block sizes are ≤4 KB.

## Critical minipro setup pitfalls

These each cost real debugging time the first time around — guard against regressing them:

- **`handle->cmdopts` must not be NULL.** `t48_begin_transaction()` reads `handle->cmdopts->icsp`, segfaulting if it's NULL. We allocate a zero-initialised `cmdopts_t` once per worker and assign it after every `minipro_open()` (and clear `handle->cmdopts` before `minipro_close` so it doesn't double-free).
- **`get_device_by_name()` needs both `infoic_path` AND `logicic_path`.** It internally opens `logicic.xml` first (database.c:1755). Without it, every chip lookup fails. MainWindow resolves both via `findMiniproFile()` and pushes them to the worker through `setInfoicPath` / `setLogicicPath` queued slots.
- **`search_chip_name()` matches one alias at a time.** minipro's XML packs aliases into one record's `name` attribute as a comma list (e.g. `"27C256@DIP28,27C256@SOIC28,27LV256@DIP28,27LV256@SOIC28"`). The merge script must store a **single** alias per row in `minipro_name`, not the bundle, because `search_chip_name` (database.c:544) `strcasecmp`s the user-supplied name against each comma-split token.
- **`setInfoicPath` / `setLogicicPath` must be slots**, not inline header methods, or `QMetaObject::invokeMethod` can't dispatch them and the paths silently never reach the worker.

## Chip database

`merge_chip_lists.py` produces a JSON catalog containing **every chip the Windows Xgpro lists** (37,103 entries in `T48_List.txt`) but flags those that minipro can actually program. After the alias fix the supported count is ~32,600 alias-expanded entries from ~11,500 unique XML records. Windows-only chips are surfaced in the UI grayed-out with a `supported: false` flag so users immediately know to fall back to Xgpro on Windows.

Each supported entry carries the minipro fields needed for runtime + ZIF rendering: `pin_count`, `pin_map`, `package_details`, `adapter`, `icsp`, `protocol_id`, and the per-alias `minipro_name` token. Bit layout of `package_details` mirrors `database.c`:
- bits 0–7  (`ADAPTER_MASK 0x000000ff`): adapter type (0 = direct ZIF; 1 = TSOP48 adapter; etc.).
- bits 8–15 (`ICSP_MASK 0x0000ff00`): ICSP flags.
- bits 24–29 (`PIN_COUNT_MASK 0x3f000000`): pin count (or PLCC adapter sentinel `0x38`/`0x3D`/`0x3E`/`0x3F` → 20/44/28/32 pins).

## Chip category coverage

minipro tags each chip with a numeric `chip_type` (the `type=` attribute in `infoic.xml`). Our pipeline carries it **end-to-end** — `merge_chip_lists.py` emits `"type"`, `ChipDatabase` loads it into `ChipEntry.type`, and `ChipSelectDialog` has a **category filter** (`ChipFilterProxy` gates on `entry->type`). Mapping to the Windows Xgpro selector categories:

| Xgpro category | `type` | minipro can do | wired in our GUI |
|---|---|---|---|
| ROM / FLASH / NVRAM | 1 | read / write / verify / erase | ✅ full |
| MCU / MPU | 2 | the above **+ fuses** | ✅ full (fuse editor) |
| PLD / GAL / CPLD | 3 | JEDEC read/write/erase (`minipro_read/write_jedec_row`) | ⚠️ **erase only** — no JEDEC fuse-map UI |
| SRAM | 4 | RAM test (`minipro_test_ram_generic`) | ❌ not wired |
| Logic (7400-series) | 5 | vector test (`minipro_logic_ic_test`, from `logicic.xml`) | ❌ not wired |
| NAND | 6 | **nothing** — blocked | ❌ |
| eMMC / eMCP | 7 | **nothing** — blocked | ❌ |
| VGA / HDMI (EDID) | 8 | **nothing** — blocked | ❌ |

**Known limitations:**
- **NAND / eMMC / VGA are a minipro limitation, not just missing UI.** minipro has no protocol code for them and rejects them outright (`main.c` ≈ line 3353, "This chip is not supported yet."). Supporting them would require **upstreaming to minipro**, not GUI work. The T48/T56 hardware *can* do them under Xgpro on Windows.
- **Over-promise fixed (v0.6.0):** `ChipDatabase::load` forces `supported=false` for `type ∈ {6,7,8}` (NAND/eMMC/VGA) while keeping their `type` for the category filter, so they show grayed-out instead of falsely selectable. Locked in by `test_chip_database::nandEmmcVgaAreWindowsOnly`.

## Code / Data tabs

Central widget is a `QTabWidget` with one `BufferModel` + `HexView` per `MemArea`. The Data tab is **hidden until** `openChip` reports `data_memory_size > 0`. Tab labels gain a leading `● ` when their buffer has unsaved edits (`BufferModel::dirtyChanged`).

`m_buffer` / `m_hex` in `MainWindow` are **aliases** refreshed by `onCurrentTabChanged()` so every lambda call site that operates on "the current buffer / view" keeps working without per-action plumbing. `currentArea()` derives the active area from the tab index. `paneFor(MemArea)` exposes the per-area buffer, view, chip size, and tab index.

Result handlers dispatch by `result.area`, not by the tab that's visible — so a Read on Code while the Data tab is showing will fill the Code buffer and switch to it.

## ZIF socket preview (`ZifSocketView`)

Custom `QWidget` that paints the ZIF socket and overlays the selected chip outline. **The socket size and chip-insertion orientation are programmer-specific** — `MainWindow::onDetected` pushes the detected model name to `ZifSocketView::setProgrammerModel`, and `socketLayout()` maps it to `{pins, chipAtTop, notchUp}`:

| Model | Socket pins | Chip seats | Notch | Pin 1 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **T48** (verified by photo) | 48 | top (far from lever) | up | top-left, by the `IC↑` arrow |
| **T56** | 56 | top (far from lever) | down | bottom-right |
| **TL866II+/A/CS** | 40 | bottom (near lever) | down | bottom-right |
| T76 / unknown | 48 | — | — | falls back to the T48 layout |

A real DIP only inserts two ways (0°/180°), so `notchUp` alone fixes the pin-1 corner: up → top-left, down → bottom-right. Placement is computed by 0-indexed row from the socket top (`usedStart`/`usedEnd`), justified top or bottom; the chip body, pin-1 dot (`pin1Marker`), and the semicircular notch (a `drawChord` in the window colour) all follow the orientation. The `IC↑` arrow is drawn only for the notch-up (T48) layout. **Only the T48 path is hardware-verified; T56/TL866 come from the user's description of those sockets** — correct them in `socketLayout()` if a real unit disagrees.

Lever: a thick (8 px) vertical metal stem exits just outside the right pin column, runs straight down, terminates in a round ball with a subtle radial gradient. No knob, no pill shape — that's not what the real lever looks like.

For adapters (`adapter != 0`) and PLCC packages, the current widget shows a textual hint — full adapter overlays are a TODO.

## Hex editor (`HexView`)

`QAbstractScrollArea`-based, fully editable.

- **Cursor**: byte offset + column (Hex / ASCII) + nibble (high/low). Click-to-position, Tab to switch column.
- **Selection**: mouse-drag, Shift+arrow / Shift+PgUp / Shift+Home extend, Ctrl+A selects all. Translucent overlay; cursor (moving end) keeps the focus highlight.
- **Edits**: type hex digits in the Hex column (high then low → byte committed, cursor advances), printable bytes in the ASCII column. Backspace cancels a half-typed nibble or moves back. All edits go through `BufferModel::setByteAt` and are wrapped in `ByteEditCommand`s on `QUndoStack`.
- **Dirty bytes** painted in red (`#DC322F`) in both columns; cleared on `markClean()` (called after File Save and successful chip Write).
- **Fill range** (`Edit > Fill…`): start/end addresses + repeating byte pattern (hex, e.g. `EA F1 00 2C`). Live byte-count summary. Single `FillCommand` for one-step undo.
- **Copy range** (`Edit > Copy range…`): source range → destination offset. Source bytes are **snapshotted up-front** so overlapping ranges are safe. Single `CopyCommand`.
- **Find** (`Edit > Find bytes…`, Ctrl+F): hex / ASCII / decimal mode picker with live byte-preview. F3 reuses the *parsed* bytes (no re-parsing). Wrap detection: distinguishes "Match", "Search wrapped — no more instances after cursor", and "Only one match".
- **Go to offset** (Ctrl+G): decimal or `0x…` hex.

## Fuse / config-bit editor (`FuseEditorWidget`)

Third tab in the central `QTabWidget`, hidden until a chip exposes config fuses. `openChip` emits `fusesAvailable(FuseSet)` built from `(fuse_decl_t*)dev->config` (gated on `dev->config && dev->chip_type != MP_PLD && num_fuses+num_locks>0`); the MainWindow shows/hides the tab on that. One mask-aware hex field per declared fuse/lock item — **generic, driven entirely by minipro metadata**; no per-bit names (minipro carries only `{name, mask, default}`). Config fuses and lock bits are separate groups with **separate write buttons** (`onFuseWriteRequested(subset, locks)`), each behind a confirmation dialog; the lock-bits warning calls out that locks are only cleared by a full chip erase.

Value representation — the subtle part, mirroring the minipro CLI:
- minipro applies `value |= ~mask` to **both** fuses and locks on read, write, and verify. It does **not** trim to 8 bits when `word_size == 2`.
- **The ATmega328P reports `word_size = 2`** (not 1), so a raw read of `lfuse` yields `0xFF62`. To keep the UI sane we present the **significant value** (`fuseSig`: `raw | ~mask`, then `& 0xFF` when `mask <= 0xFF`) → `0x62`, and display width follows the **mask**, not word_size (2 hex digits for `mask <= 0xFF`).
- On write the worker reconstructs minipro's exact bytes with `fuseWire` (`sig | ~mask`) before `format_int` lays them down little-endian across `word_size` bytes — so a byte-wide fuse on this part writes `[0x62, 0xFF]`, identical to `minipro -w`.
- Verify compares **by significant bits per item** (`fuseSig(readback) == fuseSig(written)`), never a raw `memcmp` — the chip can return out-of-mask bits differently, which would otherwise be a false mismatch. `lock_bit_write_only` parts skip lock read-back.

The whole path is exercised read-only against live silicon by `readFusesFromAtmega328p` in the gated live harness.

## Theming / Preferences (`ThemeManager`, `PreferencesDialog`)

**File → Preferences…** (Ctrl+,) picks a theme — **Light / Dark / Hacker (green-on-black) / Amber (amber-on-black)** — and sets the **UI** and **hex-editor** font sizes independently (8–16 / 8–20 pt). Changes preview live and persist via `QSettings` (`appearance/theme` stored as the enum *name*, `appearance/uiFontSize`, `appearance/hexFontSize`); Cancel reverts to the values active when the dialog opened, Restore Defaults → Light/10/10.

`ThemeManager` is a Meyers singleton (`ThemeManager::instance()`). `loadFromSettings()` is called in `main.cpp` **before** `MainWindow` is constructed so the first paint is already themed (no flash). `apply()` forces **`QApplication::setStyle("Fusion")`** — native styles ignore large parts of a custom `QPalette`, Fusion honors every role — then sets the palette + UI font. Setters persist their key and `emit changed()`.

The `Theme` struct (`Theme.h`) holds the `QPalette` **plus accent colors** for the custom painters, because those widgets don't get their colors from the palette. Every value that used to be a hardcoded literal is now a `Theme` field: HexView dirty-byte red; all of ZifSocketView (socket body, IC↑ text, lever stem + ball gradient/outline, idle/active pins, pin text, chip body, pin-1 marker); ChipSelectDialog's Windows-only row color. Custom widgets read `ThemeManager::instance().theme().<field>` in `paintEvent` and repaint on the `changed()` signal (HexView also rebuilds its monospace font from `hexFontSize()`). Standard widgets repaint automatically from the app-palette change. To add/retune a theme, edit the one table in `ThemeManager::makeTheme()` — keep `pinActive` vs `pinIdle` and `pin1Marker` legible per theme (Hacker/Amber use lime / pale-amber pin-1 dots so they don't blend into the active-pin color).

## Buffer / file features (`FileFormat`, serialization)

`src/core/FileFormat.{h,cpp}` is a thin C++ front-end (`extern "C"`) over minipro's in-tree `read/write_hex_file` + `read/write_srec_file` (linked from `libminipro.a`; its `INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES` already exposes `ihex.h`/`srec.h`). Key gotchas baked in: the C readers walk the input with `strchr`, so input is **NUL-terminated**; they don't report parsed length, so the real extent is recovered by the **sentinel-diff** trick — parse into a `0x00`- and a `0xFF`-filled buffer; bytes equal in both are "covered". `decode()` returns a flat blob trimmed to the last covered byte; `decodeWithAddresses()` returns contiguous `(addr,bytes)` segments. `FileFormat` also holds the pure split/combine transforms (`deinterleaveEven/Odd`, `interleave`, `firstHalf/secondHalf`).

- **Load/Save** (`loadBufferFromPath` / Save handler): auto-detect HEX/S-record/binary on open; save format by extension + a type filter.
- **Open at offset…** (File menu, `onOpenAtOffset`): merge a file into the current buffer via `HexView::overlayBytes`/`overlaySegments` (one undoable `BatchWriteCommand`), with a **rebase-to-offset** (flatten from the file's lowest address) vs **honor-absolute-addresses** radio. Clamps to the buffer; reports out-of-bounds bytes.
- **Move range…** (Edit menu): `HexView::moveRange` — a `BatchWriteCommand` that writes src→dst then fills the vacated source (minus dst overlap) with a chosen byte; overlap-safe (payload snapshotted up front).
- **Split / Combine** (Edit submenu): split the buffer (even/odd or halves) to two files; combine two files (interleave or concatenate) back into the buffer.

**Auto serial-number production mode** (`SerializationConfig` + `SerializationDialog`, Device → "Serial numbers…"): a serial (`AsciiDec`/`AsciiHex`/`BinLE`/`BinBE`/`Bcd`, configurable address/width/start/step) is patched into a **copy** of the buffer right before each Write — `Programmer::writeMemory` takes the bytes by value, so `BufferModel` (undo/dirty/visible bytes) is never touched. On a successful write, `onWriteFinished` logs `<serial>\t<ISO-time>` (if a log path is set), `advance()`s, and `save()`s immediately (so a crash never reuses a serial). `patchSerial()` is a free function (unit-tested). Shown in the Write confirmation dialog + a status-bar indicator. Persisted under QSettings `serialization/`. A **Preview…** button (in `SerializationDialog` and `MassProductionDialog`) opens `HexPreviewDialog` — a read-only `HexView` (`setReadOnly`) over a copy of the buffer with the serial `selectRange`-highlighted at its offset.

**Mass-production mode** (`MassProductionDialog`, Device → "Mass production…"): programs a run of chips, re-prompting "insert the next blank chip → [Program next] [Stop]" between burns, with a target count (0 = until stopped), an optional per-chip serial advance, and an **auto-verify toggle**. Built on a shared `MainWindow::startWriteOp(force, verify, serialize)` helper (extracted from `onWriteClicked`); the loop lives in `onWriteFinished` gated on `m_massActive` (advance/log already happen there). A failed write **or a failed auto-verify** (`WriteResult.ok` is false when `autoVerify && verifyMismatches`) stops the run. The normal Write action sets `m_massActive=false` so it stays a single shot.

**Buffer lifetime:** the per-area buffers are cleared in `onSelectChip` (the explicit "user picked a new chip" event), **not** in `onChipOpened`. So an image loaded before the programmer is connected survives the auto-rebind that `onDetected` triggers (it re-`openChip`s the already-selected chip) — picking a *different* chip still clears.

## Programming voltages

**minipro sets VPP / VDD-write / VCC-verify / pulse-delay automatically from each chip's `infoic.xml` metadata** (loaded into `device_t.voltages` + `pulse_delay`, applied in `begin_transaction`). We do **not** adjust them, and the merge doesn't capture them. For confidence, `openChip` emits `chipVoltages(ChipVoltages)`: the worker decodes the encoded bytes to volts with `voltName()` — a value-match against `device->vpp_table`/`vcc_table` (or the `bb_*` tables when `flags.custom_protocol` is set), mirroring minipro's own `get_parameter`. MainWindow shows the four values in the **Write confirmation dialog**. Per-chip voltage *override* (`minipro_set_voltages`, gated on `flags.can_adjust_*`) remains a niche TODO.

## Safety / "live" testing

The connected programmer has a real T48 plugged in. **Never run destructive operations without explicit user confirmation in this conversation.** Read-only operations safe in any phase: device-info, chip-ID read, code/data-memory read, verify, blank check. Erase / Write require interactive `QMessageBox` confirmation in the UI.

**T48 cannot electrically detect a missing chip.** `minipro_pin_test()` is only wired for TL866II+ and T76; for T48 there is no hardware presence check. As a software safety net both Erase and Write do a **pre-op probe**: read the first block of code memory, and if it's all `0xFF` (either an empty socket or an already-blank chip) refuse with an explanatory dialog. Both dialogs expose a `Force` checkbox / button to skip the probe when the user is sure. Write additionally skips the probe automatically when the *source buffer* is itself all `0xFF` (writing 0xFF into an empty socket is a no-op).

If the user has an original EEPROM in the socket without a backup, the rule is: **Read → save to file → ask the user to verify the saved image** before any destructive op. The user's working chip is a Microchip-fab AT27C256 — silicon-identical to ATMEL `AT27C256@DIP28` (chip_id `0x298C`), distinct from the Intel `27C256` entry (`0x898C`) and the Atmel `AT27C256R` (`0x1E8C`). This kind of variant mismatch is what `Detect chip ID` is for.

## Conventions

- C++20, `Q_OBJECT` widgets in `src/ui/`, plain `QObject`-derived workers in `src/core/`.
- Forward-declare Qt classes in headers where possible.
- `extern "C" { #include "minipro.h" }` only inside `.cpp` files; keep minipro out of headers (use opaque forward decl `struct minipro_handle;` etc.).
- One short comment only for non-obvious WHY (e.g. "TL866 convention: chip top-justified"). No file-banner comments beyond the SPDX line.
- New chips/protocols are minipro's domain — do NOT add custom chip definitions here; upstream them to minipro instead.
- Toolbar/menu wording trends short ("Read chip…", "Verify chip…", "Write chip…") rather than verbose. File menu has Open/Save, Preferences…, Exit; toolbar has device actions only. The Maximize/Fullscreen button was removed from the toolbar; Ctrl+M toggles maximize via `setWindowState(... ^ Qt::WindowMaximized)`. On GNOME the title-bar buttons obey `org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences.button-layout` and the WM ignores our `WindowMaximizeButtonHint` — that's a user-side gsettings call (`gsettings set … button-layout 'appmenu:minimize,maximize,close'`), not something we can override.

## Not yet

- **Per-bit decode (CKDIV8 / SPIEN / BODLEVEL / BOOTRST …).** The editor is currently generic hex-per-fuse. Named-bit checkboxes would be friendlier but the bit-name tables are NOT in minipro — they'd be a UI-side lookup we'd maintain (gray area vs the "no custom chip definitions" rule). Deferred by choice.

Verified on real silicon: the live fuse **write** round-trip (`fuseWriteRoundTripCkdiv8`, double-gated behind `XGECU_LIVE_FUSE_WRITE=1`) toggled CKDIV8 in LFUSE (`0x62`↔`0xE2`), confirmed read-back + that HFUSE/EFUSE stayed untouched, and restored the original. Note this chip's HFUSE reads `0xF9` (bootloader config); the T48 programs via HVPP so ISP/SPIEN state is irrelevant.

## Niche / on-demand (deferred — minipro-capable but unverifiable without the chips in hand)

- **Logic IC test** (7400/40xx) — `minipro_logic_ic_test`; logic ICs live in `logicic.xml`, NOT our catalog (built from `infoic.xml`), so wiring this also needs the merge to include them.
- **SRAM test** — same entry point (`minipro_logic_ic_test` dispatches to `minipro_test_ram_generic` for `MP_SRAM`); SRAM chips (type 4) are already selectable.
- **JEDEC PLD/GAL programming** — **erase is wired**; the fuse-map read/write (`minipro_read/write_jedec_row` over `gal_config_t` rows + ACW/UES) is not. Sizable.
- **ICSP toggle + per-chip voltage / SPI-clock override** (`minipro_set_voltages`, `cmdopts->icsp`, `spi_clock`) — model-specific tables; T56 has no `set_voltages`.
- Per-bit fuse decode — see `## Not yet`.
