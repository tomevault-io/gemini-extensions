## Purpose

This file contains **MANDATORY instructions** for AI coding assistants (like Claude, GPT, or Cursor Agents) working in this repo. **You MUST follow these guidelines.**

Your main goals:

-   **Help build, refactor, and debug Terra UI components** (Lit-based web components, React wrappers, and Python widgets).
-   **ALWAYS use the existing documentation in `docs/` instead of re‑inventing APIs or behavior.**

**REQUIRED:** When in doubt, **you MUST read existing docs and code rather than guessing.**

---

## Where to Read Documentation

-   **Component docs (primary source)**
    -   Markdown docs for each component live at `docs/pages/components/*.md`.
    -   Examples:
        -   `docs/pages/components/map.md`
        -   `docs/pages/components/time-average-map.md`
        -   `docs/pages/components/browse-variables.md`
    -   These files usually contain:
        -   Example HTML usage blocks (often fenced as ` ```html:preview `).
        -   A `[component-metadata:terra-X]` tag; behavior is defined by the underlying component in `src/components/`.
-   **Getting started / framework integration**
    -   `docs/pages/getting-started/*.md` – overall usage, themes, installation, localization, etc.
    -   `docs/pages/frameworks/*.md` – using Terra UI with React, Vue, Angular, etc.
-   **Design tokens**
    -   `docs/pages/tokens/*.md` – color, typography, spacing, etc. **You MUST use these as the single source of truth for design decisions.**

**REQUIRED workflow when building or modifying a component:**

1. **MUST read the relevant `docs/pages/components/<component>.md` first.**
2. **MUST review its implementation in `src/components/<component>/<component>.component.ts` (and related controller/utility files).**
3. **MUST ensure proper tests exist** in `src/components/<component>/<component>.test.ts` covering:
    - Component rendering
    - Property changes
    - Event emission
    - User interactions (clicks, keyboard navigation)
    - Edge cases and error states
    - Accessibility features
4. **MUST keep the docs, implementation, and examples in sync when making behavior or API changes.**

You can also consult the built documentation site under `_site/` (mirrors `docs/`), but prefer editing/reading the Markdown sources in `docs/`.

## Core Project Layout

-   **Lit web components**
    -   Source: `src/components/**`
    -   Example complex components:
        -   `time-average-map` – `src/components/time-average-map/*.ts`
        -   `browse-variables` – `src/components/browse-variables/*.ts`
-   **React wrappers**
    -   `src/react/**` – React bindings around the web components.
-   **Python widgets / Jupyter**
    -   `src/terra_ui_components/**` – Python package for Jupyter widgets.
    -   `notebooks/playground.ipynb` – example notebook using components.
-   **Docs site**
    -   Source: `docs/**`
    -   Built site: `_site/**`
-   **Build & tooling scripts**
    -   `scripts/*.js` – Node build, theming, React wrapper generation, etc.
    -   `scripts/plop/*.js|*.hbs` – code generators for new components/widgets.

**REQUIRED:** When you need to understand how a feature works, **you MUST start from the component docs, then read the corresponding `src/components` files and any data services or utilities they depend on.**

---

## Common Commands (Node & Python)

From the repo root:

-   **Install JS deps**

```bash
npm install
```

-   **Run dev server (docs + components)**

```bash
npm start        # alias for `npm run serve`
```

This uses `node scripts/build.js --serve` and will:

-   Build the components and docs
-   Start a local dev server
-   Auto-reload the browser for most source changes (no full HMR due to custom elements constraints)

-   **Build for production**

```bash
npm run build          # builds Lit components, docs/assets, etc.
```

-   **Create a new component (scaffold)**

```bash
npm run create terra-my-component
```

This uses `plop` to scaffold:

-   Component source files under `src/components/`
-   Styles
-   Jupyter widget support
-   A docs page in `docs/pages/components/`
-   **A test file (`*.test.ts`)** – **MUST implement comprehensive tests** before considering the component complete.

After scaffolding, run `git status` to see all new/updated files and **update docs/examples as needed.**

-   **Python / Jupyter dev workflow (using `uv`)**

```bash
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
npm run start:python   # launches Jupyter Lab via .venv
```

Then open `notebooks/playground.ipynb` to test components in Jupyter.

---

## Code Style & Conventions

-   **Formatting**
    -   **MUST use Prettier** with the shared config `@gesdisc/prettier-config`.
    -   **MUST run `npm run prettier`** or rely on `lint-staged` hooks for staged `.ts` and `.js` files.
-   **Languages & frameworks**
    -   Core components are **Lit 3** web components in TypeScript (`lit` package).
    -   Data-heavy UI uses utilities such as `leaflet`, `ol`, `plotly.js-dist-min`, `ag-grid-community`, etc. **MUST extend existing patterns rather than inventing new ones.**
-   **Component naming**
    -   Custom elements **MUST use** the `terra-` prefix: `terra-map`, `terra-time-average-map`, etc.
    -   **MUST keep tag names stable**; if you must change them, **MUST update:**
        -   Component implementation
        -   Docs in `docs/pages/components/*.md`
        -   Any React/Python wrappers and examples.
-   **Structure**
    -   For complex components, logic is often split into `*.component.ts` and `*.controller.ts` plus shared utilities.
    -   **MUST use small, focused controllers and utilities** instead of bloating the component class.

**REQUIRED:** When generating or modifying code, **you MUST match the patterns already used in similar components.** For example, if editing `time-average-map`, **MUST also inspect `map` and `time-series` components** to keep UX and API surface consistent.

---

## Testing & Quality

**REQUIRED:** **ALL components MUST have comprehensive tests.** This is NOT optional.

-   **Component Testing Requirements**

    -   **MUST create or update test files** (`*.test.ts`) for every component you create or modify.
    -   **MUST use `@open-wc/testing`** utilities (`fixture`, `expect`, `html`, `waitUntil`, etc.) following existing test patterns.
    -   **MUST test:**
        -   Component rendering
        -   Property changes and attribute reflection
        -   Event emission
        -   User interactions (clicks, keyboard navigation, form inputs)
        -   Edge cases and error states
        -   Accessibility features (ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, focus management)
    -   **MUST follow existing test patterns** found in components like `accordion.test.ts`, `badge.test.ts`, etc.
    -   **MUST ensure all tests pass** before considering work complete.

-   **JS tests**

```bash
npm test                        # web-test-runner, default group
npm run test:watch              # watch mode
npm run test:component <name>   # test specific component in watch mode (e.g., npm run test:component data-access)
```

**REQUIRED:** **MUST use `npm run test:component <name>` when testing a specific component** (e.g., `npm run test:component data-access`). This runs tests in watch mode for faster iteration.

**MUST run tests when making ANY changes** to component behavior, properties, events, or data services.

-   **Static checks**

```bash
npm run prettier:check
npm run spellcheck
```

-   **Verification before publish (for maintainers)**

```bash
npm run verify      # prettier + build (placeholder for full test suite)
```

**REQUIRED:** If you introduce or modify tests, **MUST keep them aligned with web-test-runner** and **MUST follow existing test patterns** in the repo.

---

## Git & Repository Etiquette (for AI Agents)

-   **Branching**
    -   **MUST use feature branches** named like:
        -   `feature/<short-description>`
        -   `bugfix/<short-description>`
        -   `docs/<component-or-topic>`
    -   **MUST NOT commit directly to `main`** in automated workflows.
-   **Commits**
    -   **MUST use clear, imperative commit messages:**
        -   `Add time-average-map zoom controls`
        -   `Fix browse-variables search reset bug`
-   **Merging vs. rebasing**
    -   It's acceptable to use either:
        -   **Rebase** small feature branches before opening a PR to keep history linear.
        -   **Merge commits** are fine for human-maintained, multi-commit branches.
    -   **STRICTLY PROHIBITED:** As an AI, **you MUST NOT perform `git push`, `git commit`, or branching commands** unless the user explicitly asks and understands the implications.

**REQUIRED:** When suggesting git operations, **you MUST describe the commands for the human developer** instead of running them.

---

## Unexpected Behaviors / Project Quirks

-   **No full HMR for web components**
    -   The dev server can’t fully hot-reload custom elements due to browser limitations on re-defining tags.
    -   Expect page reloads instead of fine-grained HMR when editing component code.
-   **Docs generation**
    -   The Eleventy-based docs (`@11ty/eleventy`) use front matter and custom shortcodes (e.g., `[component-metadata:terra-map]`).
    -   **REQUIRED:** When editing docs, **MUST keep front matter and shortcode usage intact**; **MUST NOT convert to plain markdown headings only.**
-   **Type definitions and metadata**
    -   `dist/custom-elements.json`, `cdn/custom-elements.json`, and `web-types.json` are generated from source.
    -   **PROHIBITED:** **MUST NOT hand-edit generated files**; **MUST update the relevant source code and rerun builds instead.**

If behavior seems “magical,” look for:

-   Custom elements metadata generation (`custom-elements-manifest` configs).
-   Scripts in `scripts/*.js` that stitch together docs, metadata, and CDN builds.

## How to Work with the Component Docs (MANDATORY Workflow)

**REQUIRED:** When a user asks about a component, **you MUST follow these steps:**

-   **Step 1 (REQUIRED)** – **MUST locate its docs in `docs/pages/components/<name>.md` first.**
    -   Example: for `terra-map`, **MUST read `docs/pages/components/map.md`.**
    -   Example: for `terra-time-average-map`, **MUST read `docs/pages/components/time-average-map.md`.**
-   **Step 2 (REQUIRED)** – **MUST inspect its implementation in `src/components/<name>/**`.\*\*
-   **Step 3 (REQUIRED if applicable)** – If the question involves usage in a framework (React/Vue/Angular), **MUST also read:**
    -   `docs/pages/frameworks/react.md`
    -   `docs/pages/frameworks/vue*.md`
    -   `docs/pages/frameworks/angular.md`

**REQUIRED:** When generating example code, **you MUST mirror the examples shown in those docs** (props/attributes, events, CSS variables, etc.) and **MUST NOT invent undocumented attributes.**

---

## Things to Remember as an AI Assistant (MANDATORY Rules)

-   **STRICTLY PROHIBITED:** **MUST NEVER invent public APIs** for components; **MUST always verify attributes, events, and slots in:**
    -   The component's docs (`docs/pages/components/*.md`)
    -   The component's TypeScript source in `src/components/**`
    -   Generated metadata (`dist/custom-elements.json`) if necessary.
-   **REQUIRED:** **MUST keep docs in sync** when changing behavior:
    -   If you add a new prop/attribute/event, **MUST update:**
        -   The relevant component doc in `docs/pages/components/*.md`
        -   Examples in `_site/` if needed (via rebuild)
        -   Any cross-references in tutorials or framework docs.
-   **REQUIRED:** **MUST prefer minimal, targeted edits** over large refactors unless the user explicitly asks for a redesign.
-   **REQUIRED:** **MUST explain your reasoning briefly** when making substantial code changes, and **MUST point to the specific files you touched** so the user can review.
-   **REQUIRED:** **MUST ensure proper testing** for all components:
    -   When creating a new component, **MUST create comprehensive tests** in `*.test.ts` covering all functionality.
    -   When modifying a component, **MUST update or add tests** to cover the new/changed behavior.
    -   **MUST NOT** submit components without tests or with incomplete test coverage.
    -   **MUST verify tests pass** using `npm test` or `npm run test:watch` before considering work complete.

**REQUIRED:** If you're ever uncertain, **MUST ask the human developer for clarification** rather than guessing about user-facing behavior.
