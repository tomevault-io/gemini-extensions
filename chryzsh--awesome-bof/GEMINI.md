# BOF Catalog Maintenance Instructions

Instructions for an LLM to discover and add new BOFs to the catalog.

## Task: Weekly Issue Triage (primary workflow)

A GitHub Actions workflow runs weekly and creates an issue titled "Weekly BOF discovery report" with candidate repos. This is the main way new BOFs get added.

### Step 1: Check the Latest Open Issues

```bash
gh issue list --limit 2 --state open --json number,title,author,body,url,createdAt
```

Look for issues titled "Weekly BOF discovery report" created by `app/github-actions`.

### Step 2: Evaluate Candidates

For each candidate in the issue, check whether it's a real BOF worth adding:

```bash
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO --jq '{description,stargazers_count,language,topics,created_at,pushed_at}'
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/readme --jq '.content' | base64 -d | head -80
```

**Include** repos that are:
- Actual Beacon Object Files (C source with beacon.h, .cna aggressor scripts, etc.)
- For any C2 framework (Cobalt Strike, Sliver, Havoc, Adaptix, etc.)
- Have real source code and a reasonable README
- Low-star repos are fine if the BOF is functional and focused

**Exclude** repos that are:
- Not BOFs (false positives like "Bank of America", game mods, buffer overflow labs)
- Download-focused repos pushing pre-built binaries without proper build-from-source workflow
- Forks/copies of existing BOFs with no meaningful changes
- Empty, no description, or clearly abandoned learning repos
- Generic tool collections, cheatsheets, or pentest dumps that aren't BOF-specific
- Already in the catalog (grep BOF-CATALOG.md first)

**Suspicious/Copycat Detection** — apply extra scrutiny to repos that:
- Share the same name as an existing catalog entry but have significantly fewer stars
- Have pre-compiled binaries (.o, .exe, .dll) without corresponding source code or build instructions
- Were created by accounts less than 90 days old with fewer than 3 public repositories
- Have descriptions identical or near-identical to an existing catalog entry
- Are forks of existing entries with no meaningful commits beyond the fork point

**Malware (zip-dropper) pattern** — seen on GitHub targeting security tooling.
An attacker copies a legitimate repo's source tree and adds a payload. Reject
any candidate matching two or more of:
- `.zip` / `.7z` / `.rar` archive committed into the repo tree, especially
  inside an oddly-named subdirectory (Aquarius, Taurus, Orion and other
  zodiac/constellation names are a recurring campaign signature)
- README contains a download button or badge linking to
  `raw.githubusercontent.com/<owner>/<repo>/.../*.zip`
- README instructs users to disable antivirus/firewall/Defender, add
  exclusions, or whitelist the download
- README uses "Getting Started / Download the Application / System
  Requirements / Choose Your Version" marketing boilerplate uncharacteristic
  of BOF repos
- Repo description uses emoji + vague phrasing ("🔧 Simplify X with essential
  BOFs, providing convenient helper scripts...") without naming concrete
  techniques

When the weekly discovery issue includes **Warnings** annotations, investigate each warning before adding. If a repo has a POSSIBLE_COPYCAT warning, verify it is not a legitimate independent implementation by checking commit history and code differences.

Run the scanners periodically to audit the full catalog:
```bash
python3 scripts/audit_catalog.py          # broad quality/copycat audit
python3 scripts/malware_scan.py           # deep malware/dupe scan (zip-dropper focus)
```

### Step 3: Add to BOF-CATALOG.md

Place each BOF in the correct section:

| Section | Criteria |
|---------|----------|
| `## 🧰 BOF Collections` | Multi-BOF suites/toolkits (5+ BOFs) |
| `## 🤏 Smaller BOF Packs` | 2-5 related BOFs bundled together |
| `## C2 specific BOFs` | BOFs written for a non-Cobalt Strike C2 (Adaptix, Havoc, Sliver, etc.) |
| `## 🧩 Other BOFs` | Individual/single-purpose BOFs (default category) |

Use this table row format:
```
| [RepoName](https://github.com/owner/repo) | Short description of what it does | ![](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/owner/repo?label=&style=flat) | ![](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/owner/repo?label=&style=flat) |
```

Or use the helper: `python3 scripts/generate_md.py https://github.com/owner/repo`

### Step 4: Rebuild Search Index and Sync

```bash
python3 scripts/bof_indexer.py
bash scripts/update-site-data.sh
```

### Step 5: Commit and Push

Stage all three files, commit, and push:
```bash
git add BOF-CATALOG.md bof-index.json site/data/bof-index.json
git commit -m "feat(catalog): add N BOFs from weekly discovery issues #X and #Y"
git push
```

If push is rejected (remote has new commits), pull with rebase first:
```bash
git pull --rebase && git push
```

### Step 6: Close the Processed Issues

After pushing, close each triaged issue with a structured summary comment containing two tables — one for added repos and one for skipped repos:

```bash
gh issue close NUMBER --comment "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Triage Summary

### Added (N)
| Repo | Description | Category |
|------|-------------|----------|
| [repo-name](https://github.com/owner/repo) | Short description | Other BOFs |

### Skipped (M)
| Repo | Reason |
|------|--------|
| owner/repo | Fork of existing entry (owner2/repo) |
| owner/repo | Not a BOF — buffer overflow lab |
| owner/repo | Generic red team collection, not BOF-specific |
EOF
)"
```

Omit the "Added" table if nothing was added, or the "Skipped" table if nothing was skipped. Use the catalog section name for the Category column (BOF Collections, Smaller BOF Packs, C2 specific BOFs, Other BOFs).

---

## Task: Discover and Add New BOFs (manual)

Use this when you want to search beyond the weekly automated issues.

### Step 1: Run Discovery Script

```bash
python3 scripts/find_new_bofs.py --days 30
```

Or for a specific date range:
```bash
python3 scripts/find_new_bofs.py --since 2025-01-01
```

The script will:
- Search GitHub for C repos with "bof" keyword
- Filter out repos already in BOF-CATALOG.md
- Output candidates with stars, description, and URL

### Step 2: Filter Candidates

**Include** repos that are:
- Actual Beacon Object Files (for Cobalt Strike, Sliver, Havoc, etc.)
- Have meaningful descriptions
- Preferably 10+ stars (but interesting low-star BOFs are fine)

**Exclude** repos that are:
- Not BOFs (e.g., "Breath of Fire" game mods, buffer overflow labs)
- Forks with no meaningful changes
- Empty or abandoned (no commits in 2+ years, 0 stars, no description)
- Duplicates of existing entries
- Suspected copycats (same name as a popular repo, far fewer stars, new account)
- Repos with pre-compiled binaries but no source code or build instructions

### Step 3: Categorize

Place BOFs in the correct section of BOF-CATALOG.md:

| Section | Criteria |
|---------|----------|
| `## 🧰 BOF Collections` | Multi-BOF suites/toolkits |
| `## 🤏 Smaller BOF Packs` | 2-5 related BOFs |
| `## C2 specific BOFs` | BOFs for specific C2 (Adaptix, Havoc-only, etc.) |
| `## 🧩 Other BOFs` | Individual BOFs, single-purpose tools |

### Step 4: Generate Markdown Rows

Use the helper script:
```bash
python3 scripts/generate_md.py https://github.com/owner/repo
```

This outputs a properly formatted table row with stars and commit badges.

### Step 5: Add to Catalog

Edit BOF-CATALOG.md and add the row to the appropriate section's table.

### Step 6: Commit

```bash
git add BOF-CATALOG.md
git commit -m "Add [repo-name] to BOF catalog

[Brief description of what the BOF does]

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>"
```

### Step 7: Rebuild the BOF Index

After adding new entries to the catalog, regenerate the search index so the new BOFs are searchable:

```bash
python3 scripts/bof_indexer.py
```

This will:
1. Parse `BOF-CATALOG.md` for all repository URLs
2. Shallow-clone each repo (or reuse existing clones in `repos/`)
3. Extract BOF command names and descriptions from READMEs, `.cna` files, Havoc Python, Stage1 Python, and directory structures
4. Write the updated `bof-index.json`

Note: This clones all repos and takes several minutes. Use `--skip-clone` to reuse existing clones.

Commit the updated index:
```bash
git add bof-index.json
git commit -m "Update BOF index"
```

### Step 8: Refresh Web Search Data (GitHub Pages)

After rebuilding `bof-index.json`, sync the web UI copy so the public site uses the latest index:

```bash
bash scripts/update-site-data.sh
```

Commit the synced web index:

```bash
git add site/data/bof-index.json
git commit -m "Sync web BOF index data"
```

GitHub Pages is configured for:
- Branch: `main`
- Folder: `/`

Public web UI path:
- `https://chryzsh.github.io/awesome-bof/site/`

## BOF Search

An interactive search tool lets you fuzzy-search across all indexed BOF commands:

```bash
./scripts/bof-search.sh            # Interactive search
./scripts/bof-search.sh kerberos   # Search with initial query
```

Requires `jq` and `fzf`. See [docs/bof-search.md](docs/bof-search.md) for full usage.

```

## Notes

- Set `GITHUB_TOKEN` env var for higher API rate limits
- The catalog has 367+ BOFs - always check for duplicates
- When in doubt, ask the human for approval before adding
- After adding BOFs, rebuild the index so they appear in search
- Commit each logical change individually and frequently — don't batch unrelated changes into one commit
- Always ask before pushing — never push to remote without explicit approval

### Removing a catalog entry (fast path)

When removing a small number of entries (malware, dead repos), skip the
full `bof_indexer.py` re-clone and filter the index JSON directly:

```python
import json
from pathlib import Path
for p in [Path("bof-index.json"), Path("site/data/bof-index.json")]:
    idx = json.loads(p.read_text())
    drop = {"https://github.com/owner/repo"}  # repos to remove
    before = len(idx["bofs"])
    idx["bofs"] = [b for b in idx["bofs"] if b.get("repository") not in drop]
    meta = idx.get("metadata", {})
    meta["total_bofs"] = len(idx["bofs"])
    meta["total_repos"] = max(0, meta.get("total_repos", 0) - len(drop))
    meta["repos_parsed"] = max(0, meta.get("repos_parsed", 0) - len(drop))
    p.write_text(json.dumps(idx, indent=2))
```

This keeps whatever star metadata the last `bof_indexer.py` run produced
rather than regenerating from scratch (which costs an hour and can drop
metadata for rate-limited repos).

### Rebasing on top of the weekly workflow's index refresh

The `weekly-bof-discovery.yml` workflow auto-commits a refreshed
`bof-index.json` from github-actions[bot]. If you land catalog changes
locally while that bot pushes, you'll hit a merge conflict on
`bof-index.json`. Resolution: `git checkout --ours bof-index.json
site/data/bof-index.json` during rebase (this takes the remote's fresh
stars), then re-apply your catalog filter with the snippet above, then
`git add` and `git rebase --continue`. During rebase, `--ours` = the
branch you are rebasing onto (origin/main), opposite of merge.
