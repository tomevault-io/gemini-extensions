## What This Repo Is

**auto-uv-env** is a shell integration tool that automatically creates, activates, and deactivates Python virtual environments using `uv` when users move between directories.

It is a small system with a strict contract:

1. `auto-uv-env` (the main executable) decides *what should happen* and emits directives.
2. Shell adapters (`bash`, `zsh`, `fish`) decide *how to apply* those directives in the current shell process.

This split keeps shell state mutation out of the main executable and reduces command injection risk.

## Core Contracts

### Directive Contract (`auto-uv-env --check-safe`)

The main executable emits line-based `KEY=VALUE` directives:

- `CREATE_VENV=1`
- `PYTHON_VERSION=<x.y[.z]>`
- `MSG_SETUP=<text>`
- `ACTIVATE=<absolute path>`
- `DEACTIVATE=1`

Shell adapters must remain compatible with this exact format.

### State Tracking Contract

Adapters track `_AUTO_UV_ENV_ACTIVATION_DIR` to avoid deactivating unrelated/manual environments and to know when users leave a project tree.

Adapters also use a small in-flight guard during activation (`_AUTO_UV_ENV_RUNNING`).

Adapters should set `VIRTUAL_ENV_DISABLE_PROMPT=1` only while sourcing activation scripts, then restore the prior shell-variable state, so shell themes keep ownership of prompt rendering.

Why this exists:

```text
shell hook starts
  -> create/activate venv
    -> shell state changes
      -> another hook/plugin may react
        -> second auto_uv_env run starts too early
```

The guard keeps activation single-flight: one adapter run may be active at a time.

### Project Discovery Contract

- Project detection walks upward from `$PWD` to find the nearest `pyproject.toml`.
- If `.auto-uv-env-ignore` is encountered before any `pyproject.toml`, activation is skipped for that subtree.
- Entering an ignored subtree deactivates any currently auto-uv-env-managed environment.
- Venv creation and activation target the discovered project root, not necessarily the current directory.
- Shell adapters should prefer explicit venv paths (`uv venv /abs/project/.venv`) over `cd`-based creation.

Why this matters:

```text
Good:  project root -> explicit .venv path -> uv creates exactly there
Risky: cd project root -> run uv venv -> rely on shell location side effects
```

### Safety Contract

- Venv directory name is validated and path traversal is blocked.
- Shell state mutation stays in shell adapters, not in the main script.
- `--check` is deprecated; use `--check-safe`.
- Installer temp-directory cleanup must happen only after installed files are copied into their final location.

Why this installer rule exists:

```text
download + extract release -> return extracted path -> copy files -> cleanup temp dir
```

Not:

```text
download + extract release -> cleanup temp dir -> try to copy from deleted path
```

### Release Contract

- GitHub releases are tag-driven (`v*`), not merge-driven.
- Merging a PR into `main` does not publish a release by itself.
- Docs publishing is main-branch-driven via `docs.yml`; tag pushes alone do not deploy docs.
- Release tag, `auto-uv-env` `VERSION`, and `pyproject.toml` version must stay aligned.
- Preferred release naming convention is `Release vX.Y.Z` with structured notes sections.
- Use `RELEASE.md` as the source of truth for release mechanics and fallback procedures.

---

## Quality Gates

### Pre-commit

Configured in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:

- `pre-commit-hooks`: whitespace, YAML/TOML/JSON checks, merge conflict checks, executable/shebang checks.
- `shellcheck`: strict shell linting (external sources enabled, SC1091 ignored for sourced files).
- `detect-secrets`: scans against `.secrets.baseline`.
- Local hooks:
  - run tests (`./test/test.sh`) on pre-push
  - reject `TODO|FIXME|HACK` in main script
  - validate shell integration syntax
  - grep for dangerous `eval` patterns
  - check version consistency

### CI Workflows

- `ci.yml`: lint, security scan, tests, Homebrew audit, release checks, perf checks.
- `docs.yml`: builds/deploys Jekyll docs to Pages.
- `release.yml`: creates release artifacts from version tags.
- `test-installer.yml`: validates install/uninstall behavior across platforms.

---

## Do

- Keep behavior consistent across all three shell adapters when changing activation logic.
- Preserve the directive protocol between `auto-uv-env` and shell adapters.
- Run tests in a clean environment when validating behavior.
- Update docs when command interfaces or output formats change.
- Keep version fields synchronized across `auto-uv-env`, `pyproject.toml`, and `CHANGELOG.md`.

## Don't

- Don't reintroduce `eval`-driven execution of untrusted content.
- Don't change directive keys without updating all adapters and tests.
- Don't use deprecated `--check` in docs/examples/scripts.
- Don't assume tests are environment-isolated unless they explicitly sanitize `VIRTUAL_ENV`.
- Don't edit release automation without checking Homebrew/tap assumptions.

## Common Commands

```bash
# Core checks
./auto-uv-env --help
./auto-uv-env --version
./auto-uv-env --diagnose
./auto-uv-env --validate

# Test suites
./test/test.sh
./test/test-security.sh
./test/test-shell-integrations.sh
./test/test-deleted-venv.sh
./test/test-installer.sh

# Safer test execution when current shell has active venv state
env -u VIRTUAL_ENV -u _AUTO_UV_ENV_ACTIVATION_DIR -u AUTO_UV_ENV_PYTHON_VERSION ./test/test.sh
env -u VIRTUAL_ENV -u _AUTO_UV_ENV_ACTIVATION_DIR -u AUTO_UV_ENV_PYTHON_VERSION ./test/test-shell-integrations.sh

# Lint/quality
uv tool run pre-commit run --all-files

# Docs
./docs/serve-local.sh

# Release helpers
./scripts/check-version-consistency.sh
./scripts/bump-version.sh patch --dry-run
./scripts/release.sh 1.1.3 --dry-run
./scripts/release.sh 1.1.3
gh release view v1.1.3
gh run list --workflow docs.yml --branch main --limit 5
```

## Known Quirks and Guardrails

1. `set -e` with `((COUNT++))` can exit on first increment.
This previously affected `test/test-deleted-venv.sh` and was fixed by using pre-increment (`((++COUNT))`).

2. Tests can leak behavior when run from a shell with an active virtual environment.
Core test suites now sanitize environment variables internally; for ad-hoc runs, this wrapper remains safe:
`env -u VIRTUAL_ENV -u _AUTO_UV_ENV_ACTIVATION_DIR -u AUTO_UV_ENV_PYTHON_VERSION <test-command>`.

3. Performance baseline to preserve: v1.0.7 achieved ~93% startup overhead improvement.
Non-project directories should remain effectively near-zero overhead via lazy loading and cached command paths.

4. Releases are created on tag push (`v*`), not on PR merge.
If someone asks why there is no release after merge, check whether a new tag was created.

5. Release automation can partially succeed.
Validate release state directly with `gh release view vX.Y.Z` even if the `release.yml` workflow reports failure.

6. GitHub Pages deploy is asynchronous.
After merging docs updates, confirm the latest successful `docs.yml` run before expecting `https://auto-uv-env.ashwch.com/` to reflect changes.

## The Hard Lessons

### Lesson 1: Adapter and core must evolve together

**What happened:** behavior changes were added in adapters without complete contract-level test updates.

**Cause:** adapter logic duplicated across three shells; drift is easy.

**Fix:** treat directive keys and adapter parsing as an API, and update all adapters/tests in one change.

### Lesson 2: Shell environment leakage causes false failures

**What happened:** tests failed when run from shells with active `VIRTUAL_ENV`.

**Cause:** tests assumed clean process environment.

**Fix:** run critical suites with `env -u VIRTUAL_ENV ...` when debugging or in local validation scripts.

### Lesson 3: Shell arithmetic with `set -e` can abort tests unexpectedly

**What happened:** `test/test-deleted-venv.sh` can exit early.

**Cause:** `((TEST_COUNT++))` returns status `1` on first increment under `set -e`.

**Fix:** use `((++TEST_COUNT))` or `TEST_COUNT=$((TEST_COUNT + 1))`.

### Lesson 4: Docs drift from CLI output format breaks contributors

**What happened:** docs described JSON output for `--check-safe`, but implementation emits `KEY=VALUE`.

**Cause:** docs were not updated with contract changes.

**Fix:** update README/docs whenever CLI output contracts are changed.

## Quick Reference

**Main entrypoints**

- `auto-uv-env` -> directive producer
- `share/auto-uv-env/auto-uv-env.bash` -> Bash runtime
- `share/auto-uv-env/auto-uv-env.zsh` -> Zsh runtime
- `share/auto-uv-env/auto-uv-env.fish` -> Fish runtime

**Key flags**

- `--check-safe <dir>`: emits directives (internal integration mode)
- `--diagnose [dir]`: environment diagnostics
- `--validate`: version consistency checks
- `--version`: semantic version string

**When in doubt:** keep the main script declarative, keep shell adapters imperative, and verify all three adapters plus tests before shipping.
