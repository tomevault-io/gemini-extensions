# Harlo v6.1-MOTOR — Claude Code Project Instructions

## What This Is

A biologically-architected AI memory and action system.
Rust hot path + Python orchestration + Elenchus verification +
Co-Evolution Spiral + Inhibition-default Motor Cortex.

Architecture: Two hemispheres (Association + Composition), one Bridge
with Amygdala, one Modulation Layer with Blood-Brain Barrier, one
Verification Engine (Elenchus GVR), one Inquiry Engine (DMN), and
one Motor Cortex with Basal Ganglia gating.

All state is local. Cloud models provide reasoning; your machine
provides memory and safety.

## Tech Stack

- Rust (crates/hippocampus/) — Association Engine hot path
- PyO3 + maturin — Rust ↔ Python FFI
- Python 3.12+ — everything else
- SQLite + sqlite-vec — 1-bit vector bitwise matching
- Click — CLI framework
- jsonschema — Blood-Brain Barrier validation
- systemd / launchd — socket activation (0W idle)
- pytest — Python tests
- cargo test — Rust tests

## Running Tests

```bash
cargo test -p hippocampus          # Rust unit tests
pytest tests/ -v                   # Python unit tests
pytest tests/test_integration/ -v  # Integration tests
```

> Build/env gotchas (cost a debugging cycle on 2026-06-19 — don't re-hit):
> - `maturin develop --release` RE-RESOLVES the unpinned `>=` deps in pyproject
>   and silently upgrades the ML stack (numpy/transformers/xgboost) → native
>   segfaults in the suite. Pin the ML stack (constraints file) or rebuild the
>   ext without re-resolving (`maturin build` + `pip install --no-deps wheel`).
> - Exported `PYTORCH_MPS_HIGH_WATERMARK_RATIO` ≤ ~1.0 makes torch raise
>   "invalid low watermark ratio" on model load (also breaks `harlo recall`).
> - `PYTHONOPTIMIZE=1` (`-O`) strips production `assert`s → assert-based tests
>   fail "DID NOT RAISE". Unset for test runs. `ruff` must be installed for lint.

## The 33 Inviolable Rules

### Biological Constraints (v3.0)

1.  0-WATT IDLE: OS socket activation. No while True. No sleep().
    Daemon exits when idle. 0W between sessions.

2.  ACTION POTENTIALS: Hippocampal vectors MUST be 1-bit boolean
    arrays (Sparse Distributed Representations). Bitwise XOR
    (Hamming distance) for search. No float32. No cosine similarity.

3.  RUST HOT PATH: Association Engine is Rust via PyO3.
    Cold start: <5ms. Hot recall: <2ms. No Python in hot path.

4.  LAZY DECAY: Timestamp math on retrieval only. No polling.
    strength = initial * e^(-lambda * dt) + sum(retrieval_boosts)
    dt in DAYS (Unix seconds / 86_400); lambda = 0.05/day → 13.9-day
    half-life. See docs/adr/0003-decay-units.md.

5.  APOPTOSIS: twin consolidate physically DELETEs traces below
    epsilon. Runs VACUUM. Database file size decreases.

6.  MERKLE TREES: Composition stages use Merkle Tree hashing.
    Partial branch O(log n). Not full-file SHA256 O(n).

7.  AMYGDALA: SAFETY/CONSENT resolutions = 1-shot permanent reflex.
    Skip GVR. Skip 10-rep curve. Instant compile to cerebellum.

8.  JSON BARRIER: jsonschema.validate(). Strip epigenetic_wash on
    write path. Mood ephemeral. Facts permanent. No XML. No regex.

9.  ALLOSTATIC LOAD: Token velocity + prompt frequency, plus OPTIONAL
    opt-in biometric signals via the biometric_barrier per ADR-0001
    (see docs/adr/0001-healthkit-allostatic.md). Biometric signals
    default OFF per data type and never enter the trace / reflex
    pipelines — they live in the Modulation Layer only. Samples older
    than the configured freshness window (default 5 min) cannot drive
    cognitive_state="RED". High = DEPLETED = refuse to wake System 2.

10. ANCHORS: SAFETY/CONSENT/KNOWLEDGE/CONSTITUTIONAL = gain 1.0
    ALWAYS. Structural. Returns 1.0 before evaluating receptor density.

### Elenchus Constraints (v4.0)

11. TRACE EXCLUSION: verify() NEVER receives reasoning trace.
    Parameter must be None or absent. BUILD FAILS if present.

12. VERIFIED-ONLY CONSOLIDATION: Only VERIFIED resolutions become
    reflexes. FIXABLE/SPEC_GAMED/UNPROVABLE never consolidated.
    BUILD FAILS if unverified resolution leaks to reflex cache.

13. MAX 3 GVR CYCLES: ADHD guard. After cycle 3, promote FIXABLE
    to UNPROVABLE. Loop MUST terminate.

14. INTENT PRESERVATION: Bridge checks output answers the original
    intent, not a reframed easier question.

15. SPEC-GAMING DETECTION: Correct answer to wrong question is the
    dominant failure mode. Detect it. Surface it. Never consolidate it.

16. UNPROVABLE IS DIGNIFIED: Carries metadata (reason, what_would_help,
    partial_progress). First-class state. Park with dignity.

17. BURST DEFERS, NOT SKIPS: Queue unverified outputs during burst.
    Run GVR on burst exit. Surface problems.

18. RED OVERRIDES EVERYTHING: No GVR. No injection. No inquiry.
    No motor. Full stop. Recovery menu.

### Inquiry Safeguards (v5.1-v5.2)

S1. APOPHENIA GUARD: Minimum evidence threshold per inquiry depth
    (5/8/15/25 independent observations). Alternative hypothesis
    required. Confidence disclosure mandatory.

S2. EPISTEMOLOGICAL BYPASS: Inquiry outputs verified for tone +
    boundaries, NOT objective truth. Self-reported traces bypass
    Elenchus ONLY when consumed by src/inquiry/ namespace.
    Composition namespace gets standard verification (DIRECTIONAL).

S3. RUPTURE & REPAIR: Rejection = permanent non-decaying trace
    (weight 2.0). Apophenia threshold adjusts. Repair bid delayed.
    3 rejections -> offer to stop. Threshold mean-reverts over time
    (90-day halflife + 0.1 credit per accepted inquiry).

S4. UTILITY MODE: twin mode utility mutes DMN. Behavioral traces
    invisible to inquiry. Semantic state updates visible (WHAT not HOW).
    Mode switch NOT logged as behavioral trace. Timestamps fuzzed
    to ISO week before DMN synthesis.

S5. INQUIRY APOPTOSIS: Queued inquiries carry TTL (48h-30d by type).
    Decay via e^(-3t/ttl). Below 20% relevance = physical delete.

S6. DMN SYNTHESIS WINDOW: Asynchronous teardown. CLI released in
    <50ms. Daemon runs background synthesis up to 30 seconds.
    Then process exits. 0W.

S7. TRACE CRYSTALLIZATION: Emerging patterns (3+ observations,
    below threshold) get decay rate reduced to lambda/10. Max 50
    crystallized traces. Stale after 30 days without new obs.
    Eviction by preservation_score = (obs/threshold) * depth_weight.

S8. SINCERITY GATE: User responses classified as sincere/sarcastic/
    exasperated/performative/uncertain before tagging self_reported.
    Sarcasm -> emotional_rupture. Performative -> low weight.
    Uncertain -> ask for clarification. Default: trust the user.

### Motor Cortex Constraints (v6.0)

19. TEARDOWN PREEMPTION: New CLI commands during DMN teardown MUST
    preempt. Save to temp file (/dev/shm/), NOT SQLite. Release
    in <10ms. Human presence always wins.

20. PERCEPTION GAP TRACES: When Elenchus falsifies self_reported
    trace in Composition, emit perception_gap trace. DMN turns
    the contradiction into a co-evolutionary inquiry.

21. CRYSTALLIZATION EVICTION: preservation_score = (obs/threshold)
    * depth_weight. Evict lowest. Deep patterns survive over noise.

22. UTILITY TIMESTAMP FUZZING: Fuzz to ISO week before DMN synthesis
    on utility-mode semantic traces.

23. INHIBITION DEFAULT: Basal Ganglia defaults to INHIBIT ALL.
    Every action requires ALL five checks to pass. One failure =
    inhibit. No exceptions.

24. ONE ACTION AT A TIME: Motor Cortex executes ONE atomic action,
    returns to full cognitive loop. No automatic chaining.

25. LEVEL 3 IS STRUCTURAL: Financial transactions, irreversible
    deletions, other people's data, anchor-touching actions.
    Gate NEVER opens. Like anchor immunity.

26. MOTOR REFLEXES ALWAYS GATED: Skip planning, NEVER skip Basal
    Ganglia. Safety checks run every time, even on cached patterns.

27. DEPLETED DOWNGRADES MOTOR: DEPLETED state -> Level 1 becomes
    Level 2 (require per-action consent).

28. RED KILLS MOTOR: RED state halts ALL motor activity. Gate locked.

29. REVERSIBILITY CAP: Level 1 + irreversible = Level 2.
    Level 2 stays Level 2 (flagged RED in UI).
    Level 3 is ONLY for anchor/consent violations.
    NEVER: Level 2 + irreversible = Level 3 (logical deadlock).

30. PREEMPTION TEMP FILE: During abort, dump to /dev/shm/ or .tmp.
    NEVER write to SQLite during preemption. Kill process. Hot-path
    reads, merges, deletes temp file on boot.

31. ACTION PLAN PERSISTENCE: Active ActionPlan + current_step_index
    stored in Composition stage. Motor mutates to Step N+1 on
    success. Premotor checks for active plan before generating new.

32. MOTOR REFLEX ZERO-TOLERANCE: Single failure = instant
    de-compilation (compiled=False, success_count=0). Route to
    Premotor for re-planning.

33. BLIND SPOT ACCEPTANCE: If user rejects perception_gap inquiry,
    tag claim as blind_spot_accepted. Elenchus keeps using objective
    truth for Composition but NEVER emits gap traces for that
    specific claim again. Claim-specific, not categorical.
    The Twin chooses the relationship over the truth.

## Compliance Checks

```bash
grep -r "sleep(" python/harlo/              # MUST return 0 results
grep -r "while True" python/harlo/          # MUST return 0 results
grep -r "float32" crates/                            # MUST return 0 results
grep -r "cosine" crates/                             # MUST return 0 results
grep -r "DELETE.*audit" python/harlo/       # MUST return 0 results
grep -r "reasoning_trace" python/harlo/elenchus/verifier.py  # Must be None/absent
grep -r "store_reflex" python/harlo/        # Must check verification_state
grep -rn "biometric" python/harlo/elenchus/ python/harlo/bridge/ 2>/dev/null  # MUST return 0 — Rule 9: biometric data stays in Modulation Layer, never enters traces/reflexes
```
