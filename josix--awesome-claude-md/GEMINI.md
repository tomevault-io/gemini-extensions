# GitHub Copilot Instructions

This file provides guidance to GitHub Copilot when working with code in this repository.

**Important**: This file should stay synchronized with `CLAUDE.md` to ensure consistent AI assistant behavior across different tools. Any changes to project structure, guidelines, or standards should be reflected in both files.

## Project Overview

**awesome-claude-md** is a curated collection of high-quality `CLAUDE.md` files from public GitHub repositories, plus a curated list of tools that generate, sync, or manage `CLAUDE.md` files. The goal is to showcase best practices for using `CLAUDE.md` files to onboard AI assistants to codebases.

## Repository Structure

When suggesting file paths or navigation, follow this structure:
```
awesome-claude-md/

```

## Core Categories

When adding new examples, use these primary categories:
- `complex-projects/` - Multi-service projects with detailed architecture
- `libraries-frameworks/` - Core concepts, APIs, and usage patterns
- `developer-tooling/` - CLI tools with commands and configuration
- `project-handoffs/` - Current state with blocking issues and next steps
- `getting-started/` - Development environment setup focused
- `infrastructure-projects/` - Large-scale systems and runtime environments

## Tools & Ecosystem

The repository also maintains a curated table of tools directly related to `CLAUDE.md` workflows (e.g., tools that generate, sync, or manage `CLAUDE.md` files). These are listed in the `README.md` under the "Tools & Ecosystem" section and are NOT counted as examples. Inclusion criteria: must be directly related to `CLAUDE.md` workflows. License type is shown for reference.

## File Naming Conventions

### Directory Names
- Use lowercase with hyphens: `complex-projects`, `developer-tooling`
- Repository directories: `[owner]_[repo]` format (e.g., `microsoft_semanticworkbench`)

### File Names
- Original files: `CLAUDE.md` (preserve exactly as found)
- Analysis files: `README.md` (our evaluation)
- This displays automatically when browsing GitHub directories

## Common Development Patterns

### Documentation Structure
When creating README.md files, follow this pattern:
```markdown

## Development Workflow Patterns

### Automated Discovery
The repository includes an automated system for discovering new CLAUDE.md files:
- **GitHub Action**: Weekly scheduled workflow to search GitHub
- **Discovery Script**: `scripts/discover_claude_files.py` orchestrates the discovery workflow
- **Modular Architecture**: Discovery system is split into focused modules:
  - `scripts/discovery/loader.py`: Loads existing repositories to avoid duplicates
  - `scripts/discovery/searcher.py`: Searches GitHub for CLAUDE.md files
  - `scripts/discovery/evaluator.py`: Evaluates and scores repository candidates
  - `scripts/discovery/reporter.py`: Creates issues and reports
  - `scripts/discovery/reporters/`: Specialized reporter components for formatting
  - `scripts/discovery/utils.py`: Shared utilities (retry logic, logging)
- **Quality Evaluation**: Automatic scoring based on repository metrics and content
- **Community Review**: Issues created with candidate repositories for manual assessment
- **See**: `AUTOMATED_DISCOVERY.md` for complete documentation

### Command Organization
Suggest commands grouped by purpose:
```markdown
### Building
- `[build command]` - Build description
- `[release build]` - Release build description

### Testing
- `[test command]` - Test description
- `[integration tests]` - Integration test description

### Development
- `[dev command]` - Development description
- `[watch command]` - Watch mode description
```

### Architecture Documentation
Structure architecture sections like:
```markdown
## Architecture Overview

**Core Components:**
- `[directory/]` - Component description
- `[package]` - Package purpose

**Key Workflows:**
- [Workflow 1] - Description
- [Workflow 2] - Description
```

## Code Completion Context

When working with this repository:

### For Python code
- No specific Python code in this repository (documentation only)

### For Markdown files
- Use consistent heading levels (## for main sections, ### for subsections)
- Include code blocks with language specification
- Use bold for emphasis on key terms
- Include links to repositories and documentation

### For GitHub search
- Use specific filename searches: `filename:CLAUDE.md`
- Focus on content quality: `"## Architecture"`, `"## Development Commands"`
- Include quoted strings for specific sections: `"## Testing"`, `"## Deployment"`

### For file operations
- Always use absolute paths within the repository
- Follow directory naming conventions strictly
- Update README.md table of contents after adding examples
- **Keep copilot-instructions.md and CLAUDE.md synchronized** when making structural changes

## Development Commands

### Code Quality Tools
- `ty check`: Run type checking
- `ruff check .`: Lint entire project
- `ruff format .`: Format code using Ruff
- `complexipy scripts/`: Analyze code complexity
- `ty check && ruff check . && ruff format .`: Combined type checking, linting, and formatting
- `pre-commit run --all-files`: Run all pre-commit hooks on all files
- `pre-commit run`: Run pre-commit hooks on staged files only
- **Remember to fix type errors and linting errors after running ty and ruff**

### Development Workflow
- `uv sync`: Install dependencies
- `pre-commit install`: Install pre-commit hooks (run once after cloning)
- `uv run discover-claude-files`: Run the discovery script
- `pytest`: Run tests
- `pytest --cov`: Run tests with coverage

### Code Analysis
- `complexipy scripts/discover_claude_files.py`: Check complexity of main discovery script
- `complexipy scripts/discovery/`: Analyze complexity of discovery modules
- `complexipy scripts/ --max-complexity 10`: Set custom complexity threshold
- `complexipy scripts/ --output json`: Export complexity analysis as JSON

### Discovery System Architecture
The discovery system follows a modular design with single responsibility principle:
- **Main Script** (`discover_claude_files.py`): 45 lines - lightweight orchestrator
- **Individual Modules**: Each module handles one specific concern (loading, searching, evaluating, reporting)
- **Reduced Complexity**: Complex functions split into smaller, focused components
- **Better Testability**: Each module can be tested independently with 70+ comprehensive tests
- **Maintainability**: Changes to one component don't affect others
- **Clean Test Structure**: Test files mirror module structure in `tests/discovery/`

### Repository Maintenance
- Review discovery issues created by the automation system
- Update main README.md with table of contents after adding examples
- Keep copilot-instructions.md and CLAUDE.md synchronized

## GitHub Pages Static Site

The repository includes a browsable static site at `https://josix.github.io/awesome-claude-md/`.

### Site Structure
- **Location**: `docs/` folder (served via GitHub Pages)
- **Technology**: Jekyll with custom dark theme
- **Features**: Search, category filters, language filters, responsive design

### Key Files
- `docs/_config.yml`: Jekyll configuration
- `docs/_layouts/default.html`: Base HTML layout
- `docs/assets/css/style.css`: Dark-themed responsive CSS
- `docs/assets/js/main.js`: Search and filter functionality
- `docs/index.html`: Main page with all examples

### Adding New Examples to the Site
When adding new examples to `scenarios/`, also update `docs/index.html`:
1. Add a new `<div class="example-card">` in the appropriate category section
2. Include data attributes: `data-category`, `data-language`, `data-title`, `data-repo`, `data-description`
3. Follow the existing card structure

### Local Development
```bash
cd docs
bundle install  # First time only
bundle exec jekyll serve
# Visit http://localhost:4000/awesome-claude-md/
```
