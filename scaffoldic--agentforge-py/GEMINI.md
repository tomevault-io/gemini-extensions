## What this repo is

`agentforge-py` is the Python implementation of [AgentForge](https://github.com/Scaffoldic/agentforge-py),
an open-source plug-and-play framework for building production AI
agents. The repo is a **uv workspace** with two member packages today:

- `packages/agentforge-core/` — locked contracts (ABCs, value types,
  production-rails primitives, resolver, testing utilities). No I/O,
  no third-party SDKs except Pydantic + python-ulid.
- `packages/agentforge/` — default runtime (`Agent` orchestrator,
  `InMemoryStore`, configuration loader). Imports from
  `agentforge-core`; never the reverse.

When new modules ship (provider clients, persistence drivers, MCP,
observability, safety, etc. — see `CHANGELOG.md`), each lands as a
new directory under `packages/`. The workspace glob in the root
`pyproject.toml` already covers them.

## Hard rules

| # | Rule | Reference |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `agentforge-core` imports nothing from `agentforge` or any other module package. It is the leaf of the dependency graph. | dependency policy |
| 2 | Contracts in `agentforge-core` (every ABC + the `Finding` Protocol + the locked value types) are **stable surface**. Adding a method to an ABC is a major version bump; adding a field with a safe default is a minor bump. | locked contract layer |
| 3 | Configuration is data, not code. No dynamic imports from YAML; no Jinja inside config. Env-var interpolation only (`${VAR}`, `${VAR:default}`, `${VAR:?error}`, `$$` → `$`). | `agentforge.config` |
| 4 | No magic numbers in production code. Every threshold / timeout / limit comes from a Pydantic config model with a documented default. | configuration policy |
| 5 | Test coverage must be ≥ 90% on every commit. Pre-commit blocks below; CI ratchet rejects regressions on `main`. | `.pre-commit-config.yaml` + `.github/workflows/ci-linux.yml` |
| 6 | One feature = one branch = one PR. Conventional Commits format (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `refactor:`, `chore:`, `perf:`, `revert:`). | PR template |
| 7 | Never bypass pre-commit with `--no-verify` unless the user explicitly authorises it for a specific commit (and the bypass is documented in the commit message). | pre-commit policy |
| 8 | Type hints everywhere. `mypy --strict` is the gate. `Any` only at genuine boundaries (raw provider responses); never to paper over untyped internals. | `pyproject.toml > [tool.mypy]` |
| 9 | Async-first. Public methods on locked contracts are `async def`. Sync callers use the `*_sync` shims (where exposed) or `asyncio.run()`. | locked contract layer |

## Anti-patterns reviewers will reject

- **Importing another agent framework's primitives** anywhere. Wrong framework.
- **Hand-written JSON schemas** for tools — use Pydantic models on the
  `Tool` ABC's `input_schema` class attribute (or the `@tool`
  decorator once feat-004 ships).
- **API keys as YAML literals** — use `${ENV_VAR}`.
- **Catching exceptions to "make robust"** — let them surface; the
  framework records them as observations and the LLM recovers.
- **Wrappers around `Agent.run()` to add cross-cutting features** —
  use the hook system (`on_step` / `on_finish`) once feat-009 ships
  observability backends.
- **Module-level singleton config** (`dspy.configure(...)` style) —
  use dependency injection.
- **Threading for I/O** — use `asyncio`.

## Workflow

This project is **fully self-contained**: every spec / state /
standard / checklist / CHANGELOG / design / ADR / workflow rule
lives inside `agentforge-py/`. A new contributor cloning the repo
standalone — without seeing any parent directory — has everything
needed to contribute.

The complete per-feature workflow is captured in this file
(see *Branch + PR rules* below) plus the project's standards
(`.claude/standards/`) and checklists (`.claude/checklists/`).
Don't reference anything outside this repo.

### Reading order on session resume

1. This file (`AGENTS.md`)
2. `.claude/state/current.md` — the live snapshot. **Local-only,
   git-ignored** (per-session working state, not published); may be
   absent on a fresh clone — create it when you start tracking work.
3. `.claude/state/log.md` — append-only milestone history. Also
   local-only / git-ignored.
4. [`docs/features/README.md`](./docs/features/README.md) — feature
   catalogue
5. The active feature spec at
   [`docs/features/feat-NNN-*.md`](./docs/features/) (linked from
   `state/current.md`)
6. [`docs/roadmap.md`](./docs/roadmap.md) — shipped + backlog
   pointer
7. [`CHANGELOG.md`](./CHANGELOG.md) — release notes

### Branch + PR rules

- Branch from `main`. Conventional branch names:
  `feat/<NNN>-<slug>`, `fix/<slug>`, `docs/<slug>`, `chore/<slug>`.
  **`<NNN>` must match the canonical feature number** in
  `docs/features/feat-NNN-*.md`. If you can't find a canonical spec
  for the work, the work doesn't have a feat-NNN number — use a
  `chore/` or `docs/` branch instead, or write a spec first.
- **Every feature PR updates the matching canonical spec's
  Implementation section** — what shipped, what was deferred, any
  deviations from the original design, link to the PR. The spec is
  the durable record; CHANGELOG is the user-facing summary. Both
  ship in the same PR.
- **Every feature PR adds (or updates) a `## Runbook` section in
  the matching canonical spec.** This section is task-oriented
  (audience: agent developers using the framework, not framework
  maintainers): "How do I do X with this feature?", "How do I
  configure / swap / extend it?", "What goes wrong and how do I
  debug it?". When feat-011 (Copier scaffolding) and feat-019
  (runbook system) ship, the templating engine consumes these
  sections and renders proper runbook files into scaffolded agent
  projects. Authoring inline avoids the bootstrap problem of
  retroactive runbook debt.
- **Every feature PR sweeps forward references to its feat-NNN
  out of existing runbooks.** Before opening the PR, run
  `git grep -nE 'feat-NNN|backlog|will ship|will land|will gate|not yet shipped' docs/features/*.md`
  against the feature's own number (and any backlog package
  names it ships, e.g. `agentforge-anthropic`). Update or delete
  every match so the runbooks reflect the now-shipped surface
  rather than the past-tense "when this lands…" caveat. Same
  applies when a backlog package ships under a feature.
- **Every feature PR updates `.claude/state/current.md` and appends
  to `.claude/state/log.md`** at every milestone (analysis,
  design-approved, chunk-complete, PR-raised, shipped). The state
  files are the audit trail across sessions.
- Every commit goes through pre-commit (`pre-commit install` after
  a fresh clone). The hook runs ruff / mypy / bandit / pytest /
  coverage. Failures block.
- One feature = one PR. Squash-merge to `main`.
- CI runs the same checks plus a multi-OS test matrix (Linux,
  macOS, Windows) on Python 3.13.

### Tagging + releases

- Every `vX.Y.Z` tag **requires release notes** at
  `docs/releases/vX.Y.Z.md`, generated from the template in
  [`.claude/templates/release-notes.md`](./.claude/templates/release-notes.md)
  and walked through [`.claude/checklists/pre-release.md`](./.claude/checklists/pre-release.md).
  The GitHub Release body is the rendered file. Full rules in
  [`.claude/standards/git.md`](./.claude/standards/git.md)
  §Tagging & releases.
- Coordinated release train per
  [ADR-0015](./docs/adr/0015-coordinated-release-train.md):
  every framework release bumps every in-scope workspace
  package to the same minor.
- No skipping versions. Spec metadata's `Target version` is
  aspirational; the actual tag a feature lands in wins.

## How to add a new module package

1. Create `packages/agentforge-<X>/` with the structure used by
   existing members (`pyproject.toml`, `src/agentforge_<x>/`,
   `tests/unit/`).
2. Declare entry points in the new `pyproject.toml` under
   `[project.entry-points."agentforge.<category>"]`.
3. Pin against `agentforge-core ~= <current major>`.
4. Add at least one test.
5. If the module belongs to a curated extra (`[anthropic]`, `[full]`,
   etc.), update `packages/agentforge/pyproject.toml`'s
   `[project.optional-dependencies]`.

## Pre-commit (local)

```bash
uv sync --group dev
uv run pre-commit install
```

The hook runs:

- `ruff format` (pinned to `v0.15.12` — matches the venv and CI)
- `ruff check --fix`
- `mypy --strict` on `packages/*/src/`
- `bandit -c pyproject.toml -r packages/*/src/`
- `pytest -q -x -m "not live"` (per-package + workspace tests)
- `pytest --cov --cov-fail-under=90`

## Reading order on a fresh clone

1. This file.
2. `README.md` — quickstart, repo layout, install + dev commands.
3. `CHANGELOG.md` — what's shipped and what's coming.
4. `packages/agentforge-core/src/agentforge_core/` — the locked
   contract layer. Start with `contracts/` then `values/` then
   `production/`.
5. `packages/agentforge/src/agentforge/agent.py` — the orchestrator
   that ties everything together.
