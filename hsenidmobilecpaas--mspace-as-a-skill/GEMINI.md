mSpace is Mobitel's application platform for **Sri Lanka**. It exposes SMS, USSD, subscription
management, mobile-account charging, OTP verification and location as JSON-over-HTTPS APIs.

It has two tracks: **Inzpire**, the API track this skill is about, and **Xpand**, a no-code track
for Contact, Vote, Alert and Scheduled Messages applications. If the requirement is fully covered
by an Xpand template, say so rather than building an integration.

**Apply these instructions whenever the work involves mSpace, Inzpire, Xpand, `api.mspace.lk`,
`tel:` MSISDN addressing, USSD menus, short code and keyword routing, subscriber base size,
mobile-account charging, or telco SMS in Sri Lanka.**

The platform is JSON over HTTPS, so **any language builds a complete integration** — write it in
whatever the host project already uses. Every endpoint is written out as a runnable curl, with its
parameters and its response defined, in
[references/14-curl-reference.md](references/14-curl-reference.md): translate the request into the
project's HTTP client and you have the call, whatever the language. There is no code generator
here on purpose — a curl is the same call in every language, where an emitter would serve six and
age with their idioms. [references/12-any-stack.md](references/12-any-stack.md) specifies the
surrounding integration language-neutrally, and reference implementations exist for
TypeScript/Node, Python, Java, Go, PHP and C# as worked examples.

## Non-negotiable rules

1. **Never hardcode `applicationId` or `password`.** Environment variables only, read through one
   config module, validated at startup. Not in source, not in a client bundle, not in a committed
   file, not in a log, not in git history. For CaaS the password is the API key mailed to you on
   application approval — move it out of that inbox.
2. **Never call mSpace from client-side code.** Browsers and mobile apps call *your* backend; your
   backend calls mSpace. The credentials are a shared secret and the platform enforces the
   *Allowed Host Address* list.
3. **Never subscribe or charge without explicit, recorded consent**, and never without disclosing
   the amount and frequency first. Both are provisioning-level settings on the application.
4. **Never assume `subscriberId` is a real phone number.** With Mobile Number Masking enabled it
   is a masked value. Store and send back exactly what you received.
5. **Charging is idempotent on `externalTrxId`**, persisted *before* the call and reused unchanged
   on any resolution attempt. Never retry with a fresh one.
6. **`S1000` is not the only success code.** CaaS OTP generation succeeds with **`P1003`**, and
   Subscriber List treats **`S1001`** ("No Subscribers Found") as a success.
7. **Every field is a string on the wire except `requestPage`.** `amount`, `otp`, `referenceNo`,
   `externalTrxId`, `action`, `encoding` and `deliveryStatusRequest` all look numeric and are all
   strings. Serialised as JSON numbers they corrupt the body silently — `"5.00"` becomes `5`, an
   OTP loses its leading zero, a 31-digit `referenceNo` becomes `8.8e+30`.

## Query the API catalog instead of guessing

This repo ships the complete mSpace contract as structured data
([`catalog/mspace-api.json`](catalog/mspace-api.json)) plus a zero-dependency CLI over it.
**Run these instead of recalling parameter names** — they are offline, read-only, need no install,
and never see credentials.

```bash
node tools/mspace.mjs list [category]              # every service and callback
node tools/mspace.mjs show <id>                    # full contract: params, response, rules
node tools/mspace.mjs search "<query>"             # find by intent, e.g. "base size"
node tools/mspace.mjs curl <id> [key=value ...]    # runnable request + param/response defs
node tools/mspace.mjs validate <id> '<json>'       # check a payload against the spec
node tools/mspace.mjs response <id> '<json>'       # read a real response against the contract
node tools/mspace.mjs code <statusCode>            # decode a status code + the fix
node tools/mspace.mjs diagnose "<symptom>"         # cause and fix from a symptom
node tools/mspace.mjs practices [severity]         # security and reliability rules
node tools/mspace.mjs checklist                    # go-live checklist
node tools/mspace.mjs reference <doc>              # print a reference document
node tools/mspace.mjs platform                     # base URL, tracks, operator, conventions
```

Add `--json` to any command for machine-readable output. If you cannot run commands — or Node is
not installed — read `catalog/mspace-api.json` directly; it is plain JSON with the same data. The
CLI is a documentation reader, not part of the integration, and constrains nothing about the stack
you build in.

**Use them in this order:** `search` or `list` to find the service → `show` for the exact
contract → the curl reference for the call → `validate` the payload → `code` / `diagnose` when
something fails.

### Write the call from the contract, not from memory

**[references/14-curl-reference.md](references/14-curl-reference.md) is the source for every call,
in every language.** Each endpoint is written out at the wire: a runnable curl, every parameter
defined with type and requiredness, the exact response, every response field explained, the status
codes that endpoint returns — and the same for the inbound callbacks, including a command that
replays each one against your handler.

Translate the request into the host project's HTTP client and idiom, keeping the payload, the
`statusCode` branching and the per-service success codes exactly as specified. Body, headers and
branching are identical everywhere, so no language is second-class. `node tools/mspace.mjs curl
<id> key=value …` prints the same thing for one service with your values filled in and validated.

Run the curl by hand when a call fails: it separates a bad payload from bad code in one step, and
proves credentials, provisioning and the egress IP at once.

**There is no code generator in this skill, by design.** An emitter covers only the languages
someone wrote emitters for and ages with those languages' idioms rather than with the mSpace
contract. Write the client in the project's own conventions from the contract above; the seven
components it belongs in are in [references/12-any-stack.md](references/12-any-stack.md), and
[templates/](templates/README.md) shows them already built in six languages as worked examples to
read — never a reason to add one of those runtimes to a project.

Working reference implementations in [templates/](templates/README.md) for TypeScript/Node,
Python, Java, Go, PHP and C#. Read the one matching the project's stack for shape rather than
inventing a different structure; for any other language, build the same seven components from the
curl reference — and never introduce a new runtime to reach mSpace.

## The six Inzpire APIs

mSpace publishes six APIs on its Inzpire services page. Every one of them is covered here:

| API | What mSpace says it does | Reference |
|---|---|---|
| **SMS API** | Send messages to your subscriber base and receive messages from your subscribers, plus delivery reporting to track the status of the delivery | [02-sms](references/02-sms.md) |
| **USSD API** | Initiate USSD sessions over a HTTP-based API — menu-driven applications, monetised per menu request, with an active session | [03-ussd](references/03-ussd.md) |
| **Subscription API** | Register or unregister a subscriber, send subscription notifications, query subscription status and query subscriber base size | [04-subscription](references/04-subscription.md) |
| **OTP API** | Incorporate a One Time Password verification process to enable subscription in the mobile application you develop | [05-otp](references/05-otp.md) |
| **CaaS API** | Monetise your app with micro-payments — charge a specific amount from a subscriber's account | [06-caas](references/06-caas.md) |
| **LBS API** | Request the location of a subscriber, returned if they have granted permission | [07-lbs](references/07-lbs.md) |

`node tools/mspace.mjs platform` prints this list with the endpoint count for each.

The CaaS description on that page also mentions retrieving account balance. The API documentation
defines a `queryBalance` schema but publishes **no endpoint path** for it, so there is nothing to
call — see [06-caas](references/06-caas.md). Voice and IVR are not in the documentation at all.

---

## Service map

Production host `https://api.mspace.lk`.

**Configure one environment variable per provisioned service**, not one base URL — an application
can only call the APIs it was provisioned for. An unset endpoint means that API is not enabled,
and the client should refuse to call it rather than fail with `E1309` at the platform. See
[templates/.env.example](templates/.env.example).

| Need | Endpoint |
|---|---|
| Send SMS (MT) | `POST /sms/send` |
| Send to the subscribed base | `POST /sms/send` with `destinationAddresses: ["tel:all"]` |
| Receive SMS (MO) | *your Message Receiving URL* |
| Delivery report | *your Delivery Report URL* |
| USSD screen out | `POST /ussd/send` |
| USSD input in | *your USSD Connection URL* |
| Register (opt-in) | `POST /subscription/send` with `action: "1"` |
| **Unregister (opt-out)** | `POST /subscription/send` with `action: "0"` |
| Subscriber status | `POST /subscription/getStatus` |
| **Subscriber base size** | `POST /subscription/query-base` |
| Last-charge details for up to 10 subscribers | `POST /subscription/getSubscriberChargingInfo` |
| Subscriber list, paged | `POST /subscription/getSubscriberList` |
| Subscriber notification | `POST /subscription/notify` |
| Subscription change notification | *your Subscription Notification URL* |
| OTP request / verify (subscription activation) | `POST /otp/request`, `POST /otp/verify` |
| **Start a charge** (sends an OTP, returns `P1003`) | `POST /caas/direct/debit` |
| **Complete the charge** (verifies the OTP, moves the money) | `POST /caas/otp/verify` |
| Charging outcome | *your Charging Notification URL* |
| Locate a subscriber | `POST /lbs/request` |
| Voice / IVR, balance query | Not publicly documented — do not invent endpoints |

Each of these as a runnable request, with every parameter and response field defined:
[references/14-curl-reference.md](references/14-curl-reference.md).

## The universal request/response shape

```
POST {baseUrl}/{path}
Content-Type: application/json;charset=utf-8

{ "applicationId": "APP_001807", "password": "…", "version": "1.0", …fields… }
```

```json
{ "statusCode": "S1000", "statusDetail": "Success", "version": "1.0" }
```

So: **one `post()` helper that injects credentials and takes the success set as a parameter, plus
thin wrappers per service.** Do not write bespoke HTTP calls per endpoint, in any language.

**Two envelope irregularities to code for:**

- **CaaS OTP generation succeeds with `P1003`**, and **Subscriber List also accepts `S1001`**.
- **CaaS OTP verification returns `statusDescription`, not `statusDetail`**, plus a boolean
  `status`.

Both are recorded per endpoint as `successCodes` and `responseMessageField`, and
`node tools/mspace.mjs response <id> '<body>'` applies them to a body you actually received —
including per-recipient failures hiding under a top-level `S1000`, and the values the next call
needs (`requestCorrelator`, `referenceNo`, `requestId`).

**Addressing** — always `tel:`-prefixed, no `+`, no spaces:

```
tel:94702725777          plain MSISDN
tel:hu3b84346f…          masked value (Mobile Number Masking) — opaque
tel:all                  the subscribed base (SMS send only — guard this)
```

Normalise in one helper. Never concatenate `tel:` inline. The one field that is *not* a subscriber
address is SMS `sourceAddress`: that is the Default Sender Address or a configured alias, and it
carries no `tel:` prefix.

---

## Mistakes to avoid

- ❌ Checking the HTTP status as success (`res.ok`, `raise_for_status()`,
  `EnsureSuccessStatusCode()`, `http_errors`) — **mSpace returns 200 for errors.** Branch on
  `statusCode`.
- ❌ Hard-coding `statusCode === "S1000"` as the only success — that reports every successful
  charge request (`P1003`) as a failure and an empty subscriber base (`S1001`) as an error.
- ❌ Reading only `statusDetail` — CaaS OTP verification puts the message in `statusDescription`.
- ❌ Treating `POST /caas/direct/debit` as "the charge". It only sends an OTP. The money moves on
  `POST /caas/otp/verify`, and the charging notification settles it.
- ❌ Passing your `externalTrxId` as `referenceNo` to CaaS OTP verification — it wants the
  `requestCorrelator` from the generation response, or you get `E1855`.
- ❌ Retrying a charge with a new `externalTrxId` after a timeout — double charge.
- ❌ `destinationAddresses: "tel:94…"` — it is always an **array**.
- ❌ `"amount": 5.00`, `"otp": 123456`, `"action": 1`, `"referenceNo": 8801442233…` — all of these
  are **strings**. As JSON numbers they lose decimals, leading zeros and precision, and the
  platform answers `E1103`, `E1107` or `E1312` for a body that reads correctly.
- ❌ Omitting `version` on SMS Send or USSD Send, where it is mandatory.
- ❌ Looking for a top-level `messageId` on an SMS send response — the identifiers are per
  recipient, inside `destinationResponses`.
- ❌ Treating subscription status as a two-state field. There are six: `INITIAL`, `REG_PENDING`,
  `TRIAL`, `REGISTERED`, `UNREGISTERED`, `TEMPORARY_BLOCKED`.
- ❌ Sending more than 10 `subscriberIds` to Subscriber Charging Info, or a `requestPage` below 1
  to Subscriber List (`E1106`).
- ❌ Swapping LBS `requesterId` and `subscriberId` — they are separate mandatory fields, and
  swapping them locates the wrong person. Its response also uses `messageID` and `timestamp`, with
  casing that differs from every other service.
- ❌ Generating your own USSD `sessionId` — echo the USSD Gateway's.
- ❌ Ending a USSD flow with `mt-cont` — terminal screens use `mt-fin`.
- ❌ An in-process USSD session store (`Map`, `dict`, `HashMap`, package-level `map`) in
  production — breaks across instances.
- ❌ Doing work before acknowledging a callback — sessions time out in seconds. Use the stack's
  real background mechanism, not a bare `await`. An unparseable response comes back as `E1607`.
- ❌ Disabled TLS verification in shipped code — `rejectUnauthorized: false`, `verify=False`,
  `InsecureSkipVerify`, `CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER => false`, a trust-all `TrustManager`. Supply the
  intermediate CA instead.
- ❌ `NEXT_PUBLIC_` / `VITE_` / `REACT_APP_` / `PUBLIC_` / `EXPO_PUBLIC_` on any mSpace variable,
  or serving it through a client-facing config endpoint — that ships the password to the browser.
- ❌ Standing up a Node sidecar (or any second runtime) to call mSpace from a non-JS project.
- ❌ Logging `password`, the OTP, `referenceNo`, `requestCorrelator`, or an unmasked
  `subscriberId`.
- ❌ Inventing an IVR or balance-query endpoint — there is no public specification for either.

---

## When you generate code, always

- Put credentials in `.env` (git-ignored) with a placeholder-only `.env.example`.
- Validate config at startup and fail loudly on missing variables.
- Set an explicit timeout on every call.
- Branch on `statusCode`, with the success set as a per-service parameter, and map codes to
  behaviour classes (success / pending / configuration / client / user-state / transient).
- Retry only transient codes and transport errors, with backoff — never a charge with a new ID.
- Model charging as a persisted state machine over three exchanges, keyed by `externalTrxId`, and
  store `requestCorrelator` and `internalTrxId` from the generation response.
- Make callback handlers acknowledge first, validate the schema, verify `applicationId` where the
  payload carries it, and deduplicate.
- Log `requestId` / `sessionId` / `externalTrxId` / `internalTrxId` / `statusCode`; mask subscriber
  addresses.
- Mirror subscription state locally from the Subscription Notification URL instead of polling
  `getStatus`, and use Subscriber List to catch up on notifications you missed.
- Use a decimal type for money — `BigDecimal`, `decimal.Decimal`, `decimal`, `bcmath`, a decimal
  library, or integer minor units. Never a binary float. The currency is `LKR`.
- Match the host project's existing stack, structure and conventions.
