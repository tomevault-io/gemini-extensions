## Project purpose

Self-hostable, Docker-first service for Snapmaker U1:

upload `.3mf` → validate plate → slice with Snapmaker OrcaSlicer → preview → print via Moonraker.

**Current Status:** Fully functional upload-to-print workflow with printer status monitoring.

---

## Non-goals (v1)

- No MakerWorld scraping (M26 adds optional authenticated link import)
- No per-object filament assignment (single filament per plate)
- No mesh repair or geometry modifications
- No multi-material/MMU support
- LAN-first by default (no cloud dependencies)

---

## Milestones Status

### Foundation & Core Pipeline
✅ M0 skeleton - Docker, FastAPI, services  
✅ M1 database - PostgreSQL with uploads, jobs, filaments  
✅ M3 object extraction - 3MF parser (handles MakerWorld files)  
✅ M4 ~~normalization~~ → plate validation - Preserves arrangements  
✅ M5 ~~bundles~~ → direct slicing with filament profiles  
✅ M6 slicing - Snapmaker OrcaSlicer v2.2.4, Bambu support  

### Device Integration & Print Execution
✅ M2 moonraker - Health check, configurable URL, print status polling

✅ M18 multi-plate visual selection - Show plate names and preview images when selecting plates

### Preview & UX
✅ M7 preview - Interactive G-code layer viewer (superseded by M12 3D viewer)
✅ M12 3D G-code viewer - Interactive 3D preview using gcode-preview + Three.js (orbit rotation, multi-color, arc support, build volume)
✅ M20 G-code viewer zoom - Zoom in/out buttons, scroll-wheel zoom toward cursor, click-drag pan, fit-to-bed reset
✅ M21 upload/configure loading UX - Progress indicators during upload preparation
✅ M22 navigation consistency - Standardized actions across UI
✅ M28 printer status page - Always-accessible printer status overlay with live progress, temps, and controls

### Slicing Controls & Profiles

✅ M35 Settings backup/restore - Export/import all settings (filaments, presets, defaults) as portable JSON
❌ M36 AI-powered model colorization - Segment single-color models into geometric regions, assign colors (manual + Claude Vision AI suggestions), output paint_color 3MF for multi-color printing. Depends on M33 (shared 3D viewer). See `memory/milestone-ai-colorization.md`

**Current:** 34 / 39 complete (87%)

## Definition of Done (DoD)

A change is complete only if:

### Docker works
`docker compose up -d --build` must succeed.

### Health works
`curl http://localhost:8000/healthz` returns JSON.

### Deterministic
- Orca version pinned
- per-bundle sandbox
- no global slicer state

### Logs
Every job writes `/data/logs/{job_id}.log`.

### Errors
Errors must be understandable and visible in API/UI.

---

## Core invariants (do not break)

### Docker-first
Everything runs via compose.

### Snapmaker OrcaSlicer fork
Use Snapmaker's v2.2.4 fork for Bambu file compatibility.
When packaging via Flatpak bundles, avoid adding moving external remotes (for example Flathub) during Docker builds; install only pinned Snapmaker release bundles to keep builds reproducible.

### Preserve plate arrangements
Never normalize objects - preserve MakerWorld/Bambu layouts.

### LAN-first
Designed for local network use, no authentication required.

### Storage layout
Under `/data`:
- uploads/ - Uploaded 3MF files
- slices/ - Generated G-code
- logs/ - Per-job logs
- cache/ - Temporary processing files

---

## How Claude should behave

Prefer:
- small safe steps
- minimal moving parts
- explicit over magic
- **always run regression tests after code changes** (deploy first, then test)
- offer targeted vs full test suite choice to the user

Avoid:
- new infra unless necessary
- hidden state
- plaintext secrets
- skipping tests after changes (even "small" ones can break things)
- **assuming test failures are pre-existing or flaky** — if a test fails after your changes, investigate it as a regression caused by your code. Never dismiss failures without evidence they were already failing before your changes

### Release & Docker Images

After pushing commits, **always ask the user if they want to tag a release** to trigger Docker image builds on GHCR.

**IMPORTANT: Never push directly to prod.** Always release as beta first (`v1.x.x-beta.1`), then promote to stable (`v1.x.x`) after testing.

```bash
# Beta release (always do this first)
git tag v1.x.x-beta.1 && git push origin v1.x.x-beta.1

# Stable/prod release (only after beta has been tested)
git tag v1.x.x && git push origin v1.x.x
```

This triggers `.github/workflows/release.yml` which builds and pushes Docker images to GHCR, creates a GitHub Release with auto-generated notes, and attaches `docker-compose.prod.yml`. Beta tags get `:beta` + prerelease flag, stable tags get `:latest`.

### Third-Party License Attribution

When adding vendored libraries, CDN dependencies, or new pip/npm packages:

1. **Update [THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES.md](THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES.md)** with the library name, version, license type, copyright holder, and source URL.
2. Vendored files in `apps/web/lib/` must retain their original license headers (do not strip `@license` comments from minified files).
3. All dependencies must be compatible with the project's AGPL-3.0 license.

### Documentation Maintenance

**CRITICAL:** As you make fixes, implement features, or discover issues:

1. **Update AGENTS.md** when you:
   - Discover new invariants or patterns
   - Learn about system behavior that affects future work
   - Identify new constraints or requirements
   - Complete milestones or major features

2. **Update MEMORY.md** when you:
   - Fix bugs (document root cause + solution)
   - Discover configuration issues
   - Learn about performance or optimization patterns
   - Find differences between expected/actual behavior
   - Identify recurring problems and their solutions

**Keep these files living documents.** Don't wait to be asked - update them proactively as you work.

---

### Regression Testing (MANDATORY)

**You MUST run regression tests after every code change.** Do not skip this step. Deploy changes to Docker containers first, then test against live services.

**Testing workflow:**
1. Make code changes
2. Deploy to Docker (`docker compose build --no-cache <service> && docker compose up -d <service>`)
3. Run the appropriate tests (see table below)
4. If tests fail, fix and re-run — do not leave failing tests

**Do not run heavy suites in parallel** (for example `test:slice`, `test:extended`, or `npm test` alongside another slicer-dependent suite).
- They contend for the same Docker services / slicer resources and can cause false timeouts or flaky failures.
- Run heavy suites sequentially.

**After making changes, offer the user a choice:**
- "I can run the **fast regression** (`npm run test:fast`), **extended regression** (`npm run test:extended` for heavy multi-plate/transform cases), **targeted tests** (`npm run test:<suite>`), or the **full suite** (`npm test`). Which do you prefer?"
- For very targeted changes (1-2 files, clear scope), default to running targeted tests or `test:fast`.
- For broad changes (multiple files, API + frontend, refactors), recommend `test:fast` or full suite.

```bash
# Fast regression (~124 tests, ~5 min; excludes heavy @extended multiplate/transform cases)
npm run test:fast

# Extended regression (~7 tests, ~5 min; heavy multi-plate / slice-plate transform cases)
npm run test:extended

# Quick smoke tests (always run, ~15 seconds, no slicer needed)
npm run test:smoke

# Run all tests (requires Docker services running with slicer, ~60 min)
npm test
```

**When to run which tests:**

| Changed files | Run these tests |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Any web file (`index.html`, `app.js`, `api.js`, `viewer.js`) | `npm run test:smoke` + relevant feature suite |
| API routes or backend logic | `npm run test:smoke` + `npm run test:slice` |
| Upload/parser changes | `npm run test:upload` + `npm run test:multiplate` |
| Filament/preset changes | `npm run test:settings` |
| Viewer changes | `npm run test:viewer` |
| Multicolour/profile embedder | `npm run test:multicolour` + `npm run test:multicolour-slice` |
| Slice settings/overrides | `npm run test:slice-overrides` |
| Error handling/edge cases | `npm run test:errors` |
| File deletion or management | `npm run test:files` |
| File-level print settings | `npm run test:file-settings` |
| Copies/duplicator changes | `npm run test:copies` |
| Settings backup/restore | `npm run test:backup` |
| Test file changes only | The affected suite(s) |
| Any significant or cross-cutting change | `npm test` (full suite) |

**After rebuilding web container** (`docker compose build web && docker compose up -d web`), always run at least `npm run test:smoke` to verify the UI still loads.

**When to add new tests:**
- Every bug fix should have a test that would have caught it
- Every new feature should have at least one happy-path test
- Add tests to existing spec files when possible; create new spec files only for new feature areas

**Common regressions to watch for:**
- Click handlers broken after UI changes
- Event propagation issues (@click.stop)
- State not updating after async operations
- API endpoints returning wrong data types
- Alpine.js x-show/x-if conditions becoming stale
- `page.waitForFunction(fn, arg, options)` — second param is `arg`, not `options`

---

### Plate Validation Contract

Entire plate must:
- Fit within 270x270x270mm build volume
- Return clear warning if exceeds bounds
- Preserve original object arrangements from 3MF

---

## G-code contract

Compute:
- bounds
- layers
- tool changes

Warn if out of bounds.

---

## Web Container Deployment

**CRITICAL:** The web service uses `COPY` in Dockerfile, not volume mounts.

After editing any web files (`index.html`, `app.js`, `api.js`, `viewer.js`):
```bash
docker compose build web && docker compose up -d web
```

Then users must hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R).

**Why:** Files are baked into the image at build time (see `apps/web/Dockerfile` lines 7-10).

---

## Multi-Plate 3MF Support (NEW - M7.1)

The system now supports multi-plate 3MF files (like BambuStudio multi-plate exports):

### Problem Solved
Multi-plate files were being treated as a single giant plate, causing:
- False "Width exceeds build volume" warnings  
- No way to choose which plate to slice

### Implementation
1. **Multi-Plate Parser** (`multi_plate_parser.py`):
   - Detects multi-plate files by parsing `<build>` section
   - Extracts individual plates with transform matrices
   - Returns plate objects with positions and validation info

2. **Enhanced Upload Endpoint**:
   - Returns `is_multi_plate: true` for multi-plate files
   - Includes individual plate validation results
   - Maintains backward compatibility

3. **New API Endpoints**:
   - `GET /uploads/{id}/plates` - Get plate information
   - `POST /uploads/{id}/slice-plate` - Slice specific plate

4. **Updated Web UI**:
   - Shows plate selection interface for multi-plate files
   - Validates individual plates against build volume
   - Allows selecting specific plate to slice

### User Workflow
1. Upload multi-plate 3MF file
2. See all plates with validation (which ones fit build volume)
3. Select specific plate to slice
4. Slice only the selected plate

### Files Modified
- `apps/api/app/multi_plate_parser.py` - NEW (includes bounding box fix)
- `apps/api/app/routes_upload.py` - Updated
- `apps/api/app/plate_validator.py` - Updated  
- `apps/api/app/routes_slice.py` - Updated
- `apps/web/index.html` - Updated (loading indicator, plate selection UI)
- `apps/web/app.js` - Updated (plate loading, state management, slice fix)
- `apps/web/api.js` - Updated

### Known Issues & Fixes Applied

**Fixed: Bounding Box Calculation**
- **Problem**: Multi-plate files showed "Exceeds build volume" incorrectly
- **Root Cause**: Transform matrices were being incorrectly applied to bounding box calculation
- **Fix**: Fixed matrix transformation in `multi_plate_parser.py` to correctly calculate bounds
- **Result**: Dragon Scale (80mm x 40mm x 20mm) now correctly shows "Fits build volume" ✅

**Fixed: Loading State**
- **Problem**: "Loading plate information..." stuck indefinitely on fresh upload
- **Root Cause**: `loadPlates()` called without uploadId in HTML template; no loading state tracking
- **Fix**: Added `platesLoading` state variable; proper loading/loaded state transitions

**Fixed: Wrong File Sliced**
- **Problem**: After selecting one upload then another, wrong file would slice
- **Root Cause**: `startSlice()` used `this.selectedUpload` which could change during async operations
- **Fix**: Capture upload ID/filename at start of `startSlice()` before async operations

**Fixed: Fresh Upload Plate Detection**
- **Problem**: Plates not loading after fresh upload
- **Root Cause**: Frontend made redundant API call instead of using plates from upload response
- **Fix**: Now uses plates data directly from upload response (no extra API call needed)

**Fixed: Wrong Plate Sliced (Wrong File Size & Time)**
- **Problem**: When slicing a specific plate, it sliced ALL plates - causing 100MB+ file size, 22 hour print time
- **Root Cause**: `slice_plate` endpoint was using original full 3MF instead of extracting selected plate
- **Fix**: Added `extract_plate_to_3mf()` in `multi_plate_parser.py` to extract only the selected plate before slicing
- **Result**: Single plate now slices correctly (~16MB, ~3.4 hours for Dragon Scale)

**Fixed: Stale Build Volume Warnings**
- **Problem**: Existing uploads showed incorrect "Exceeds build volume" warnings even after fixes
- **Root Cause**: Bounds were validated at upload time and stored; re-validation wasn't happening
- **Fix**: GET /upload/{id} now re-validates bounds each time using current validator
- **Result**: Existing uploads now show accurate build volume status ✅

**Fixed: G-code Viewer Colors**
- **Problem**: G-code viewer only showed hardcoded blue color, ignoring filament colors
- **Root Cause**: Viewer didn't receive or use filament color data
- **Fix**: 
  1. Added `filament_colors` column to `slicing_jobs` table (schema.sql)
  2. Slice endpoints now store filament colors as JSON array
  3. GET /jobs/{id} returns filament_colors
  4. viewer.js fetches job status and uses filamentColors[0] for extrusion color
- **Result**: G-code viewer now shows the filament color used for slicing ✅

**Fixed: Multicolor Viewer Legend (M15)**
- **Problem**: No way to see all colors when slicing multi-color files
- **Fix**: Added color legend below viewer showing all extruder colors (E1, E2, etc.)
- **Files**: viewer.js, index.html
- **Result**: Color legend shows when multiple colors detected ✅

**Fixed: Flexible Filament Assignment (M16)**
- **Problem**: Couldn't override filament color - color was tied to filament profile
- **Fix**: 
  1. Added `filament_colors` parameter to slice requests (array of hex colors)
  2. Color picker in UI to override detected colors per extruder
  3. Priority: user override > detected colors > filament default
- **Files**: routes_slice.py, api.js, app.js, index.html
- **Result**: Can now assign any color to any extruder ✅

**Multicolour Stability Update (Assignment-Preserving Path Added)**
- **What changed**: Added an assignment-preserving profile embedding strategy for Bambu multicolour files in `profile_embedder.py`.
  - Preserves original `model_settings.config` semantics
  - Replaces incompatible custom G-code with Snapmaker-safe machine scripts
  - Sanitizes known invalid project settings values
  - Normalizes filament arrays to match assigned extruder count
- **Result on validation file**: `calib-cube-10-dual-colour-merged.3mf` now slices successfully with real tool changes (`T0`, `T1`) instead of single-tool output.
- **Safety behavior remains**: Slice endpoints still fail fast if multicolour is requested and output is only `T0`.
  - Error: `Multicolour requested, but slicer produced single-tool G-code (T0 only).`
- **Tracking tool**: `apps/api/app/multicolor_matrix.py` remains available for additional strategy validation on other model variants.

**Fixed: >4 Color Support (Color-to-Extruder Mapping)**
- **Problem**: `Dragon Scale infinity.3mf` reports 7 detected color regions while U1 supports max 4 extruders; previously rejected with fallback to single-filament mode.
- **Fix**:
  1. Frontend maps all detected colors to available extruders (E1-E4) via round-robin assignment. Users can reassign any color to any extruder via dropdown.
  2. Multiple colors can share an extruder (no swap logic — direct assignment).
  3. Backend accepts up to 4 `filament_ids` and applies `extruder_remap` to collapse >4 source extruders in the 3MF pre-slice. Per-filament arrays are padded to match.
- **Result**: Files with any number of colors are fully supported in multicolour mode with user-configurable extruder mapping.

**Active-Color Detection Update (Assignment-Aware)**
- **Problem**: Some Bambu files report many palette/default colors in metadata, which overstated actual extruders in use.
- **Fix**: `parser_3mf.py::detect_colors_from_3mf()` now prioritizes model-assigned extruders from `Metadata/model_settings.config` and maps them to active colors from `project_settings.config`.
- **Result**: Dragon now reports only assigned colors (e.g., 3 active colors instead of 7 metadata colors), improving UI assignment behavior and validation decisions.

**Fixed: SEMM (Painted) Multicolour Files Detected as Single-Colour**
- **Problem**: Bambu-style painted files (e.g., SpeedBoatRace, colored 3DBenchy) with `paint_color` per-triangle attributes showed only 1 detected colour, hiding the multicolour UI.
- **Root Cause**: `detect_colors_from_3mf()` early-returned with only the colour at the single object-level `extruder="1"` assignment, missing the other filament colours used by the painting data.
- **Fix**:
  1. `parser_3mf.py`: Detects `paint_color` data in mesh triangles (via `_has_paint_data()`) regardless of `single_extruder_multi_material` flag — some exports set it to "0" even for painted files. Returns all `filament_colour` entries when paint data is present, preventing phantom `extruder_colour` from mixing in.
  2. `profile_embedder.py`: Added `_has_paint_data_zip()` to detect paint data. Enables SEMM mode (`single_extruder_multi_material=1`) and disables `ooze_prevention` (incompatible with SEMM+wipe tower) for painted multicolour files.
  3. `routes_slice.py` (both endpoints): `required_extruders` and `multicolor_slot_count` now use `max(active_extruders, detected_colors)` so painted files auto-expand correctly.
- **Result**: Painted files correctly report all filament colours. SEMM mode enabled for paint processing. Note: Snapmaker Orca v2.2.4 has limited per-triangle paint segmentation support.

**Fixed: Bambu Plate ID Mismatch (slice-plate 500 error)**
- **Problem**: Slicing Bambu files via `/slice-plate` returned `invalid plate id 2, total 1` error.
- **Root Cause**: Bambu files define plates via `Metadata/plate_*.json` (typically only `plate_1.json`), but our `multi_plate_parser` maps `<item>` elements to "plates" (1-indexed). UI requested plate 2 but Orca only has plate 1.
- **Fix**: `routes_slice.py` always uses `effective_plate_id = 1` for all Bambu files when calling Orca's `--slice` flag.

**Fixed: Alpine.js Double Initialization**
- **Problem**: Responsive tests timing out; all API calls firing twice during page load.
- **Root Cause**: `<body x-data="app()" x-init="init()">` called `init()` twice — Alpine v3 auto-calls `init()` on data objects from `x-data`, and `x-init` called it again. With Moonraker configured but unreachable, two sequential 10s health checks = 20s, exceeding the 15s `networkidle` timeout.
- **Fix**: Removed redundant `x-init="init()"`. Responsive tests now use `domcontentloaded` instead of `networkidle`.

**Implemented: Layer-Based Tool Change Detection (MultiAsSingle Dual-Colour)**
- **Problem**: Bambu files with mid-print filament swaps stored in `custom_gcode_per_layer.xml` (e.g., Fiddle Balls "dual colour" plates) were detected as single-colour.
- **Fix**:
  1. `parser_3mf.py`: Added `detect_layer_tool_changes()` to parse tool change entries (type=2) per plate. `detect_colors_from_3mf()` now includes colours from these entries.
  2. `profile_embedder.py`: Added `_has_layer_tool_changes()`. Files with layer tool changes now use the assignment-preserving embed path (trimesh rebuild would destroy `custom_gcode_per_layer.xml`).
- **Result**: Fiddle Balls detects 2 colours and slices with real `T0`/`T1` tool changes at the specified layer height.

**Multicolour Crash Handling Update (Clear Failure Mode)**
- **Problem**: Certain files (e.g., Dragon/Poker variants) can still segfault in Snapmaker Orca v2.2.4 when multicolour slicing is attempted.
- **Fix**: Slice endpoints now convert multicolour segfaults into a clear, actionable 400 error instead of returning raw crash output.
- **Error**: `Multicolour slicing is unstable for this model in Snapmaker Orca v2.2.4 (slicer crash). Try single-filament slicing for now.`

**Fixed: Bambu `plater_name` Segfault Trigger (Dragon/Poker Variants)**
- **Problem**: Two almost-identical files behaved differently: one multicolour slice crashed while the other succeeded.
- **Root Cause**: `Metadata/model_settings.config` carried stale `plater_name` metadata from old/deleted plate context (e.g., `Dual Colour`). Snapmaker Orca v2.2.4 can segfault on this metadata in assignment-preserving multicolour path.
- **Fix**: `profile_embedder.py` now sanitizes `model_settings.config` and clears non-empty `plater_name` values before slicing.
- **Result**:
  - `Dragon Scale infinity-1-plate-2-colours.3mf` now slices multicolour successfully (`T0`, `T1`).

**Fixed: Multi-Plate `slice-plate` Multicolour Crash Path**
- **Problem**: `POST /uploads/{id}/slice-plate` could still crash/fail for Poker/Dragon while full-file slice succeeded.
- **Root Cause**: Plate extraction/rebuild path altered model structure before slicing, reintroducing Orca instability on assignment-preserving multicolour files.
- **Fix**: Slice selected plates directly using Orca's built-in plate selector (`--slice <plate_id>`) on the embedded source 3MF, instead of extracting plate geometry first.
- **Files**:
  - `apps/api/app/routes_slice.py` (slice-plate workflow)
  - `apps/api/app/slicer.py` (`slice_3mf(..., plate_index=...)`)
- **Result**: Poker/Dragon multi-plate `slice-plate` now succeeds with real tool changes (`T0`, `T1`).

**Adjusted: Bambu Negative-Z Upload Warning Noise**
- **Problem**: Some Bambu exports showed `Objects extend below bed` warnings despite valid slicing/printing paths.
- **Root Cause**: Raw 3MF source offsets (`source_offset_z` in `model_settings.config`) can produce negative scene bounds in validation, even when slicer placement is valid.
- **Fix**: `plate_validator.py` now suppresses below-bed warnings for likely Bambu source-offset artifacts while keeping build-volume checks unchanged.
- **Result**: Bambu exports no longer show misleading below-bed warnings in upload/configure flows.

**Fixed: Sliced History Not Updating Immediately**
- **Problem**: Newly completed slices were not appearing in "Sliced Files" until browser refresh.
- **Root Cause**: Synchronous-complete slice path in frontend did not refresh jobs list.
- **Fix**: `app.js::startSlice()` now calls `loadJobs()` immediately when slice returns `status=completed`.

**Fixed: Estimated Time Showing as 0 for New Slices**
- **Problem**: Many newly sliced files showed `estimated_time_seconds = 0`.
- **Root Cause**: G-code metadata parser only handled older `estimated printing time (normal mode) = ...` comment format.
- **Fix**: `gcode_parser.py` now also parses newer summary formats such as:
  - `model printing time: ...`
  - `total estimated time: ...`
- **Result**: New slices now store and display non-zero estimated times when present in G-code comments.

**Investigated: Extruder Slot Selection vs Tool IDs**
- Frontend now preserves unassigned extruder slots in slice payload and backend supports assignment remap metadata.
- On tested models, Snapmaker Orca can still compact active tools to low indices (`T0/T1`) in output even after remap.
- Treat non-E1/E2 slot requests as best-effort until a deterministic Orca-compatible mapping strategy is found.

**Implemented: Explicit Extruder Slot Remap in Output G-code**
- **Problem**: Selecting E2/E3 in UI still produced compact tool commands (`T0/T1`) in generated G-code.
- **Fix**:
  1. Frontend now sends `extruder_assignments` in slice/slice-plate payloads and preserves slot positions.
  2. Backend remaps model-assigned extruders via `model_settings.config` when embedding.
  3. After slicing, backend rewrites compacted tool commands to requested slots in final G-code (`T*`, `M620 S* A`, `M621 S* A`).
- **Files**:
  - `apps/web/app.js`
  - `apps/web/api.js`
  - `apps/api/app/routes_slice.py`
  - `apps/api/app/profile_embedder.py`
  - `apps/api/app/slicer.py`
- **Result**: E2/E3 selections now produce non-default tool IDs in output (e.g., `T1`/`T2`) instead of collapsing to `T0`/`T1`.

**Fixed: E1/E3 Temperature Difference False Failure in UI Payload Path**
- **Problem**: Selecting non-adjacent slots (e.g., E1 and E3) from browser UI could fail with `Cannot print multiple filaments which have large difference of temperature together...` even when user selected same material profile.
- **Root Cause**: Frontend gap-fill for unused slots preferred the first global default filament (could be non-PLA), injecting a mismatched placeholder filament into `filament_ids`.
- **Fix**: In `app.js`, placeholder slot fill now prefers the first filament already selected for this slice before falling back to global defaults.
- **Result**: Browser path now slices E1/E3 without false temperature mismatch errors.

**Fixed: G-code Viewer Layer Parsing Regression**
- **Problem**: Viewer showed `No layer data returned for range 0-20` for valid G-code.
- **Root Cause**: Backend layer parser only detected `;LAYER_CHANGE`, but generated G-code used `; CHANGE_LAYER` (and some files use `;LAYER:<n>`).
- **Fix**: Updated `routes_slice.py::_parse_gcode_layers()` to detect all common layer markers.
- **Result**: `/jobs/{id}/gcode/layers` returns layer geometry again; viewer renders normally.

**Fixed: Fresh Upload Multi-Plate False Warning Path**
- **Problem**: Fresh multi-plate uploads could still show combined-scene "Exceeds build volume" warnings even when individual plates fit.
- **Root Cause**: Upload response used combined-scene validation warnings without per-plate suppression.
- **Fix**: `routes_upload.py` now performs per-plate checks during upload and suppresses combined "exceeds" warnings when any plate fits.
- **Result**: Fresh upload behavior now matches re-validation behavior from `GET /upload/{id}`.

**Implemented: Multi-Plate Visual Selection (M18)**
- **What changed**:
  1. Plate metadata now includes `plate_name` (resource object name fallback: `Plate N`).
  2. Added `GET /uploads/{id}/plates/{plate_id}/preview` to serve embedded plate preview images when present.
  3. Plate selection UI now renders plate cards with name + preview image (or `No preview` fallback).
- **Files**: `multi_plate_parser.py`, `routes_slice.py`, `index.html`
- **Result**: Selecting plates is more visual and informative, especially for large multi-plate projects.

**Implemented: Upload/Configure Loading UX (M21)**
- **Problem**: After upload bytes finished, users saw no indication while server parsing/validation was still running.
- **Fix**: Added upload phase states (`uploading` → `processing`) and an explicit "Preparing file" indicator in Step 1.
- **Files**: `api.js`, `app.js`, `index.html`
- **Result**: Users now see continuous progress from transfer through server-side preparation.

**Implemented: Navigation Consistency (M22)**
- **Fix**: Standardized secondary navigation labels to `Back to Upload` (configure) and `Start New Slice` (complete).
- **Files**: `index.html`
- **Result**: Navigation language is now consistent across the workflow.

**Fixed: Fresh Upload Plate Preview Gap**
- **Problem**: Plate previews could be missing right after a fresh upload, while the same file showed previews when selected later from Recent Uploads.
- **Root Cause**: Fresh-upload flow used plate data from upload response, which did not include preview URLs from the plates endpoint.
- **Fix**: Frontend now always reloads plate metadata via `GET /uploads/{id}/plates` after upload completes.
- **Result**: Fresh and historical upload paths now show the same plate preview behavior.

**Implemented: Embedded Upload Preview Endpoints and List Thumbnails**
- **What changed**:
  1. Added `GET /uploads/{id}/preview` to serve the best embedded 3MF preview image (Explorer-style thumbnail when present).
  2. Enhanced preview detection to include common embedded names (`thumbnail`, `preview`, `cover`, `plate`, `top`, `pick`).
  3. Upload and sliced-file lists now render thumbnail previews using upload-based preview URLs.
- **Files**: `routes_slice.py`, `index.html`
- **Result**: Users see consistent visual previews in Recent Uploads and Sliced Files.

**Improved: Single-Plate Preview + Plate Loading UX**
- **Fix**:
  1. Configure step now shows single-plate preview when available.
  2. Plate loading state now uses progress-style treatment (`Loading plate information and preview...`) to match upload UX.
- **Files**: `app.js`, `index.html`
- **Result**: Single-plate workflow feels consistent and clearer during wait states.

**Implemented: Common Slicing Options (M23)**
- **What changed**:
  1. Added Configure controls for `wall_count` and `infill_pattern` alongside existing infill density.
  2. Slice request payloads now include `wall_count` and `infill_pattern` for both full-file and plate-specific slicing.
  3. Backend applies overrides to Orca project settings (`wall_loops`, `sparse_infill_pattern`, `sparse_infill_density`).
- **Files**: `index.html`, `app.js`, `api.js`, `routes_slice.py`
- **Result**: Users can tune core print strength/speed behavior from the UI without editing profiles.

**Implemented: Extruder Presets (M24)**
- **What changed**:
  1. Added persistent extruder preset storage for E1-E4 (`filament_id` + `color_hex`) and one-row global slicing defaults.
  2. Added API endpoints:
     - `GET /presets/extruders` to fetch presets + slicing defaults.
     - `PUT /presets/extruders` to save presets + slicing defaults.
  3. Configure UI now includes an `Extruder Presets` section with `Save as Defaults`.
  4. Presets are auto-loaded and applied for new uploads (single and multi-filament paths).
- **Files**: `schema.sql`, `main.py`, `api.js`, `app.js`, `index.html`
- **Result**: Users can preconfigure default filament/color per extruder and reuse standard slicing settings across jobs.

**Implemented: Settings Tab Architecture (Machine Defaults vs Per-Job Overrides)**
- **Problem**: Machine-level defaults were mixed into per-slice Configure flow, making occasional global settings too easy to change during a single job.
- **What changed**:
  1. Added top-level `Upload` / `Settings` tabs in the web UI.
  2. Moved machine defaults editing (extruder presets + default slicing settings) to `Settings`.
  3. Configure now shows a `Machine Defaults` summary plus an `Override settings for this job` toggle.
  4. Slice payload behavior now follows: defaults when override is off, per-job override values when on.
- **Files**: `app.js`, `index.html`
- **Result**: Cleaner workflow separation between machine setup and per-job customization.

**Refined: Printer Defaults + Override Defaults UX**
- **What changed**:
  1. Renamed UI terminology from `Machine Defaults` to `Printer Defaults`.
  2. Opening `Override settings for this job` now initializes all override fields from current printer defaults.
  3. Override controls now show inline `(... printer default)` hints for quick comparison.
  4. Multicolour filament/extruder override lives under job overrides only (not in detected-colors header).
- **Files**: `app.js`, `index.html`
- **Result**: Clearer defaults model and faster per-job tuning with less accidental mismatch.

**Tidied: Filament Library UX + Default Fallbacks**
- **Problem**: Filament source/default behavior felt unclear, and fallback could appear to choose unexpected materials.
- **What changed**:
  1. `GET /filaments` ordering now prioritizes defaults and PLA entries before name-sort.
  2. Frontend filament fallback now prefers: extruder preset -> `is_default` -> first PLA -> first available.
  3. Settings section renamed to `Filament Library` with explicit starter-library explanation and `Initialize Starter Library` label.
  4. Filament cards now show `Default` badge and target extruder preset slot (`E1-E4`) for clarity.
- **Files**: `main.py`, `app.js`, `index.html`
- **Result**: More predictable automatic filament selection and clearer understanding of where library entries come from.

**Implemented: Filament Library CRUD Guardrails**
- **What changed**:
  1. Added filament update/delete/default endpoints in API.
  2. Added Settings UI controls for Add/Edit/Delete/Set Default in Filament Library.
  3. Added delete safety check: prevent deleting filaments assigned to extruder presets until reassigned.
  4. Deleting the current default now auto-promotes a replacement (prefers PLA) to keep sane fallback behavior.
- **Files**: `main.py`, `api.js`, `app.js`, `index.html`
- **Result**: Filament profiles are manageable in-app with clearer safety behavior and fewer accidental misconfigurations.

**Implemented: JSON Filament Profile Import (M13 Foundation)**
- **What changed**:
  1. Added `POST /filaments/import` to import JSON filament profiles into the Filament Library.
  2. Added `Import Profile` action in Settings with local file picker (`.json`).
  3. Added `source_type` tracking (`starter` / `manual` / `custom`) and `Custom`/`Starter` badges in UI.
- **Files**: `main.py`, `schema.sql`, `api.js`, `app.js`, `index.html`
- **Result**: Users can start bringing external filament profiles into the app while keeping source provenance visible.

**Expanded: Prime Tower Defaults/Overrides**
- **What changed**: Added additional prime tower controls in Settings + per-job overrides:
  - `prime_volume`
  - `prime_tower_brim_chamfer`
  - `prime_tower_brim_chamfer_max_width`
- **Files**: `main.py`, `schema.sql`, `routes_slice.py`, `api.js`, `app.js`, `index.html`, `profile_embedder.py`
- **Result**: More complete prime-tower tuning from UI without manual profile edits.

**Implemented: Prime Tower Options (M17)**
- **What changed**:
  1. Added machine-default prime tower settings in `Settings` (`enable_prime_tower`, `prime_tower_width`, `prime_tower_brim_width`).
  2. Added per-job prime tower overrides in Configure under `Override settings for this job`.
  3. Slice payloads now include prime tower fields for both full-file and plate slice requests.
  4. Backend applies prime tower overrides to Orca project settings and sanitizes numeric values.
- **Files**: `index.html`, `app.js`, `api.js`, `routes_slice.py`, `main.py`, `schema.sql`
- **Result**: Users can set stable machine-level prime tower behavior and selectively override per print job.

**Fixed: Hollow+Cube Multicolour Config Rejection (`prime_tower_brim_width`)**
- **Problem**: `hollow+cube.3mf` failed in multicolour path with Orca config validation error:
  - `prime_tower_brim_width: -1 not in range [0,2147483647]`
- **Root Cause**: Assignment-preserving embed path reused Bambu `project_settings.config` values but did not sanitize `prime_tower_brim_width`.
- **Fix**: Added sanitizer clamp for `prime_tower_brim_width` (min `0`) in `profile_embedder.py`.
- **Result**: Config-validation failure no longer blocks slicing for this file.

**Adjusted: Plate Slice Multicolour `T0-only` Handling**
- **Problem**: Some multi-plate projects advertise multiple colors at file level, but selected plates are effectively single-tool; strict `T0-only` fail-fast blocked valid plate slices.
- **Fix**: Kept strict `T0-only` fail-fast for full-file multicolour slices, but for `slice-plate` now continue with a warning when output is `T0` only.
- **Files**: `routes_slice.py`
- **Result**: `hollow+cube.3mf` selected-plate multicolour requests now complete instead of failing on `T0-only` guard.

**Fixed: Prime/Wipe Tower Edge Placement From Embedded Bambu Settings**
- **Problem**: Some files could place wipe/prime tower too close to bed edge (e.g., inherited `wipe_tower_x=15`), causing edge-hugging preview/print paths.
- **Root Cause**: Assignment-preserving embed path reused source `wipe_tower_x/y` without considering prime tower footprint width + brim.
- **Fix**: Added dynamic tower-position sanitizer in `profile_embedder.py` that clamps `wipe_tower_x/y` based on estimated tower half-span (`prime_tower_width`, `prime_tower_brim_width`) and U1 bed bounds.
- **Result**: New slices keep tower placement inside safer bed margins.

**Fixed: Multicolour Time Estimate Inflation on Plate Slices**
- **Problem**: Some multicolour plate slices (e.g., `hollow+cube` plate 2) reported ~2 hours when expected around ~45-50 minutes.
- **Root Cause**: Embedded config inherited single-nozzle MMU timing defaults (`machine_load_filament_time=30`, `machine_unload_filament_time=30`), inflating toolchange time estimation for U1 extruder-slot swaps.
- **Fix**: For multicolour requests (`extruder_count > 1`), slice endpoints now override load/unload times to `0` in project settings.
- **Result**: Plate 2 estimate dropped from ~2h to ~50m with prime tower enabled (and ~25m without prime tower), matching expected behavior much better.

**Fixed: Copies Grid Overlap on Multi-Component Assemblies**
- **Problem**: Dual-colour cube (two separate 10mm cubes offset in assembly) with 4 copies showed 6 visible cubes instead of 8. Adjacent copies overlapped in the center of the grid.
- **Root Cause**: `_scan_object_bounds()` in `multi_plate_parser.py` scanned vertex bounds from each component's mesh but **never applied the component transform offsets**. Both components referenced the same mesh, so combined bounds equaled one cube's bounds (10mm), ignoring the +/-7.455mm offsets. Actual assembly footprint is 24.9mm wide.
- **Fix**: Parse each component's `transform` attribute and apply translation offsets (`vals[9]`, `vals[10]`, `vals[11]`) to vertex bounds before combining.
- **Result**: Object dimensions correctly reported as 24.9x10.5x10.0mm; grid spacing prevents overlap.
- **Regression tests added**: `copies.spec.ts` — "multi-component assembly dimensions account for component offsets" (verifies width >20mm) and "copies grid has no overlapping objects" (verifies grid cell spacing exceeds object size).

**Fixed: Auto-enable Prime Tower for Multi-Color Copies**
- **Problem**: Multi-color files with copies >1 dumped 85% of extrusion as orphan purge/wipe material around objects when prime tower was disabled.
- **Fix**: `routes_slice.py` auto-enables `enable_prime_tower` when `copies > 1` AND `extruder_count > 1`.

**Implemented: Copies UI Dropdown for Mobile**
- **Problem**: Copies button row (1, 2, 4, 6, 9 + custom input) overflowed on mobile screens.
- **Fix**: Replaced with `<select>` dropdown with native OS picker. "Custom..." option reveals number input. Compact and works well on all screen sizes.

**Implemented: Settings Backup/Restore (M35)**
- Export all settings (filaments, extruder presets, slicing defaults) as portable JSON via `GET /presets/backup`.
- Import settings from JSON via `POST /presets/restore`. Round-trip compatible.
- Available in Settings modal as "Backup Settings" and "Restore Settings" buttons.

**Implemented: Vertical Layer Slider (M34)**
- Side-mounted vertical range input replaces horizontal layer slider in G-code viewer.
- Touch-optimized with `touch-action: none` to prevent mobile pull-to-refresh conflicts.

**Implemented: Webcam Integration in Printer Status Overlay**
- Added Moonraker webcam discovery (`/server/webcams/list`) and exposes webcam metadata via `GET /printer/status`.
- Overlay shows webcam tiles with external open-icon action; relative webcam URLs are resolved against Moonraker host origin (without API port).
- Preview behavior is robust: prefers `snapshot_url`, falls back to alternate URL variants (`snapshot` alt, then `stream`, then `stream` alt) on image error, and refreshes preview URLs on reload/reopen (cache-busting nonce).
- Backend now returns optional alternate webcam URL fields (`snapshot_url_alt`, `stream_url_alt`) so browser runtime can auto-switch between no-port and keep-port variants based on real image load success.
- Webcam panel is collapsed by default and webcam payload is only requested when expanded (`include_webcams=true`).
- Regression coverage in `tests/webcams.spec.ts` includes collapsed payload gating, expanded API path, preview fallback, and overlay reopen refresh.

### Performance Note
Plate parsing takes ~30 seconds for large multi-plate files (3-4MB). A loading indicator is now shown during this time.

### Testing
Upload "Dragon Scale infinity.3mf" (3 plates):
- ✅ Correctly detects 3 plates
- ✅ Each plate shows "Fits build volume" (was showing "Exceeds" before)
- ✅ Plate selection UI works correctly
- ✅ Slice Now correctly slices selected plate

## Build Plate Type & Temperature Overrides (M7.2)

Added ability to set build plate type per filament and override temperatures at slice time.

### Implementation
1. **Database**: Added `bed_type` column to `filaments` table (defaults to "PEI")
2. **API Endpoints**:
   - `GET /filaments` - Returns filaments with `bed_type` field
   - `POST /filaments` - Create filament with optional `bed_type`
   - `POST /filaments/init-defaults` - Initialize default filaments with bed types

3. **Slice Endpoints**:
   - Added optional `nozzle_temp`, `bed_temp`, and `bed_type` to `SliceRequest` and `SlicePlateRequest`
   - When provided, overrides the filament's default temperatures
   - Logs temperature settings used for each slice job

4. **Frontend**:
   - Shows bed type next to filament in dropdown
   - Temperature override section with nozzle and bed temp inputs
   - Build plate type dropdown (PEI, Glass, PC, FR4, CF, PVA)

### Files Modified
- `apps/api/app/schema.sql` - Added bed_type column
- `apps/api/app/main.py` - Added filament CRUD endpoints with bed_type
- `apps/api/app/routes_slice.py` - Added temp overrides to slice requests
- `apps/web/index.html` - Added temp override UI
- `apps/web/app.js` - Added sliceSettings fields
- `apps/web/api.js` - Added temp overrides to slice API calls

### Bug Fixes Applied

**Fixed: Temperature Overrides Not Being Sent**
- **Problem**: User set temperature overrides in UI but they weren't applied
- **Root Cause**: `api.js` was not sending `nozzle_temp`, `bed_temp`, or `bed_type` in the request body
- **Fix**: Added these fields to `sliceUpload()` and `slicePlate()` API calls in `apps/web/api.js`
- **Result**: Temperature overrides now correctly passed to API

**Fixed: Bed Temperature Not Applied in G-code**
- **Problem**: Even when sent, bed temp was 35°C instead of requested value
- **Root Cause**: Printer profile uses `bed_temperature_initial_layer_single` in G-code, but we only set `bed_temperature_initial_layer`
- **Fix**: Added `bed_temperature_initial_layer_single` to filament_settings in routes_slice.py
- **Result**: Bed temp correctly set to requested value (e.g., M140 S70)

**Fixed: Misleading Color Name Labels in Extruder Dropdown**
- **Problem**: `colorName()` function mapped NFC manufacturer colors to wrong text labels — e.g., sage green `#519F61` → "Gray", dark navy `#003776` → "Black"
- **Root Cause**: Simple Euclidean RGB distance against 11 named colors can't distinguish muted/dark manufacturer colours
- **Fix**: Replaced native `<select>` with custom Alpine.js dropdown showing actual color swatches per extruder slot (E1–E4)
- **Result**: Users see real colours instead of misleading text labels

**Fixed: Positional filament_colors Storage for Non-Default Extruder Assignments**
- **Problem**: When extruder_assignments = [2,3] (E3/E4), G-code viewer showed E1/E2 with wrong colours and pink fallback
- **Root Cause**: `routes_slice.py` extracted only active-position colors from the 4-slot positional array — storing `["#E72F1D", "#003776"]` (2 entries) instead of `["#FFFFFF", "#FFFFFF", "#E72F1D", "#003776"]` (4 entries). Viewer got 2 colors, labelled them T0/T1 (E1/E2); actual G-code T2/T3 had no color → pink fallback
- **Fix**: Store full positional `extruder_colors` array in DB (both full-file and per-plate slice paths). Hide unused `#FFFFFF` entries in viewer color legend via `x-show`
- **Result**: Viewer correctly maps T2→color[2], T3→color[3]; legend shows only active extruders
- **Regression test**: `multicolour-slice.spec.ts` — "assignments [2,3] stores full positional filament_colors in job"

---

## Custom Filament Profiles (M13)

Full import/export of OrcaSlicer-compatible filament profiles with advanced slicer settings passthrough.

### Implementation
1. **Import with Slicer Settings Passthrough**:
   - `POST /filaments/import/preview` — Previews profile before import, reports `is_recognized`, `has_slicer_settings`, `slicer_setting_count`, `color_hex`
   - `POST /filaments/import` — Stores profile with advanced settings JSON blob in `slicer_settings` column
   - ~35 OrcaSlicer-native keys are recognized and stored (retraction, fan, flow, density, cost, plate temps, etc.)

2. **Export**:
   - `GET /filaments/{id}/export` — Exports OrcaSlicer-compatible JSON with stored slicer_settings merged back in
   - Round-trip compatible: export -> re-import preserves all settings

3. **Slicer Passthrough**:
   - Both `/uploads/{id}/slice` and `/uploads/{id}/slice-plate` merge stored `slicer_settings` into `filament_settings`
   - `_merge_slicer_settings()` helper handles multi-extruder array broadcasting
   - Settings flow through `profile_embedder.py` into OrcaSlicer config
   - Explicit filament_settings (temps, bed type) take priority over passthrough keys

4. **Frontend**:
   - Import preview shows color swatch, recognition status, slicer settings count badge
   - Unrecognized profiles show amber warning
   - Each filament card has Export button and "Slicer Settings" badge
   - `api.exportFilamentProfile()` triggers browser download of JSON file

### Passthrough Keys (~35)
Retraction: `filament_retraction_length`, `filament_retraction_speed`, `filament_deretraction_speed`, `filament_retract_before_wipe`, `filament_retract_restart_extra`, `filament_retraction_minimum_travel`, `filament_retract_when_changing_layer`, `filament_wipe`, `filament_wipe_distance`, `filament_z_hop`, `filament_z_hop_types`

Fan: `fan_max_speed`, `fan_min_speed`, `overhang_fan_speed`, `overhang_fan_threshold`, `close_fan_the_first_x_layers`, `full_fan_speed_layer`, `reduce_fan_stop_start_freq`, `additional_cooling_fan_speed`

Flow/Material: `filament_max_volumetric_speed`, `filament_flow_ratio`, `filament_density`, `filament_cost`, `filament_shrink`, `slow_down_layer_time`

G-code: `filament_start_gcode`, `filament_end_gcode`

Plate temps: `cool_plate_temp`, `cool_plate_temp_initial_layer`, `textured_plate_temp`, `textured_plate_temp_initial_layer`, `nozzle_temperature_initial_layer`, `bed_temperature_initial_layer`, `bed_temperature_initial_layer_single`

### Files Modified
- `apps/api/app/schema.sql` — Added `slicer_settings TEXT` column
- `apps/api/app/main.py` — Import/export endpoints, `_SLICER_PASSTHROUGH_KEYS`, parser updates
- `apps/api/app/routes_slice.py` — `_merge_slicer_settings()` helper, both slice endpoints updated
- `apps/web/api.js` — `exportFilamentProfile()` with browser download
- `apps/web/app.js` — `exportFilamentProfile()` action
- `apps/web/index.html` — Import preview enhancements, export button, slicer settings badge
- `tests/settings.spec.ts` — Import/export test cases
- `test-data/test-filament-profile.json` — Test fixture

### Writing New Tests

- Put new spec files in `tests/` following the `*.spec.ts` naming convention.
- Use helpers from `tests/helpers.ts` (`waitForApp`, `uploadFile`, `getAppState`, `fixture`, `waitForSliceComplete`).
- The UI has **no `data-testid` attributes**. Use `getByRole`, `getByText`, `getByLabel`, or `locator` with CSS selectors.
- Alpine.js state can be inspected via `getAppState(page, 'variableName')` from helpers.
- Tests run sequentially (`workers: 1`) since they share Docker services and DB state.
- Slicing tests need up to 2 minutes per slice — use the 120s default timeout or `test.setTimeout()` for longer.

### When to Add Tests

When implementing a new feature or fixing a bug:
1. Add test cases to the relevant existing spec file.
2. If the feature opens a new area (e.g., print control), create a new spec file.
3. Every bug fix should include a test that would have caught the bug.
4. After changes, deploy to Docker and run at least the targeted test suite.
5. Offer the user a choice: `test:fast` (~2 min), `test:extended` (~5 min), targeted tests, or full suite (~60 min).

### Scale and Layout Notes (2026-02-21)

- For Bambu-style multi-component assemblies (for example `calib-cube-10-dual-colour-merged.3mf`), internal spacing is defined in both:
  - `3D/3dmodel.model` component transforms
  - `Metadata/model_settings.config` matrix metadata
- When applying scale, update both sources. Scaling only `model_settings.config` is insufficient and can leave model blocks overlapping in XY.
- For high `copies + scale` combinations that exceed the bed, fail fast with a clear fit error instead of producing overlapping output.

### Test Data Cleanup Safety (2026-02-21)

- Playwright upload cleanup is now opt-in via `TEST_CLEANUP_UPLOADS=1`.
- Default test runs preserve uploads/jobs in shared/local instances.
- Use explicit orphan cleanup for disk hygiene: remove only files not referenced by DB paths (`uploads.file_path`, `uploads.copies_path`, `slicing_jobs.gcode_path`, `slicing_jobs.log_path`).
