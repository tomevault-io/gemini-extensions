# Agent Guidance

Looking for instructions tailored to AI coding assistants?

Use [`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md). It is the canonical, maintained guide for all
agents (Claude, Cursor, ChatGPT, etc.) that interact with this repository.

## PR Title Conventions for AI Assistants

This project uses **Release Please** for automated changelog generation.
When creating PRs, use **conventional commit format** for PR titles:

### Required Format

```text
<type>[optional scope]: <description>
```

### Supported Types

- `feat:` New features (triggers MINOR version)
- `fix:` Bug fixes (triggers PATCH version)
- `revert:` Reverts of previous changes (triggers PATCH version)
- `docs:` Documentation changes (triggers PATCH version)
- `chore:` Maintenance, dependencies (triggers PATCH version)
- `refactor:` Code refactoring (triggers PATCH version)
- `style:` Formatting, linting (triggers PATCH version)
- `test:` Test changes (triggers PATCH version)
- `perf:` Performance improvements (triggers MINOR version)
- `ci:` CI/CD changes (triggers PATCH version)
- `build:` Build system changes (triggers PATCH version)

When reverting a change, use `revert:` (not the default `Revert "..."` subject)
so Release Please records it under the **Reverts** section of the changelog.
See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for the full revert workflow.

### Breaking Changes

Add `!` to indicate breaking changes (triggers MAJOR version):

- `feat!: remove deprecated API`
- `fix!: change database schema`

### Examples

```text
feat: add OAuth authentication support
fix: resolve Docker build failure
docs: update installation guide
chore: bump FastAPI dependency
feat!: remove deprecated authentication system
```

### Why This Matters

- PR titles become commit messages after squash
- Every merged PR creates/updates a Release Please PR
- Release happens when the Release Please PR is merged
- Automatic changelog generation from PR titles
- Professional release notes for users

### Release Workflow

1. Merge any PR → Release Please creates/updates a release PR
2. Review the release PR (version bump + changelog)
3. Merge the release PR when ready to release
4. Release Please publishes the release and triggers package publishing

See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed guidelines.

## Documentation Requirements

Every new feature or significant change **must** include documentation
updates as part of the same PR, not as follow-up work. Update whichever
of the following apply:

- **Docs site** (`vibetuner-docs/docs/`) — the relevant page(s) for
  the feature area
- **`llms.txt`** (`vibetuner-docs/docs/llms.txt`) — concise feature
  entry in the Features section
- **`llms-full.txt`** (`vibetuner-docs/docs/llms-full.txt`) — detailed
  documentation with code examples
- **`vibetuner-template/AGENTS.md`** — if the feature affects
  scaffolded projects (and the corresponding `.claude/rules/` file
  if applicable)

If you are unsure which docs to update, update all four. Omitting docs
from a feature PR is a review blocker.

## Testing Scaffold Changes from a Branch

When working on scaffold-related changes (template updates, CLI improvements), you can test
the scaffolding CLI directly from a branch without publishing to PyPI:

```bash
# Test scaffold command from a specific branch
uvx git+https://github.com/alltuner/vibetuner@BRANCH_NAME#subdirectory=vibetuner-py scaffold new --help

# Create a test project using the branch
uvx git+https://github.com/alltuner/vibetuner@BRANCH_NAME#subdirectory=vibetuner-py scaffold new /tmp/test-project
```

The scaffold command also accepts a `-b` parameter to specify the branch dynamically:

```bash
# Specify branch with -b parameter (when available)
uvx git+https://github.com/alltuner/vibetuner#subdirectory=vibetuner-py scaffold new -b BRANCH_NAME /tmp/test-project
```

**When to use this:**

- Testing scaffold changes before merging a PR
- Verifying bug fixes in template or CLI
- Allowing others to test your changes before review
- CI/CD integration testing

**Note:** The `.tmp/` directory at the root is gitignored. Use it for testing scaffold
commands if you have difficulty accessing external directories like `/tmp`:

```bash
# Test scaffolding in the repo's .tmp directory
uvx git+https://github.com/alltuner/vibetuner@BRANCH_NAME#subdirectory=vibetuner-py scaffold new ./.tmp/test-project
```

See `vibetuner-docs/docs/development.md` for complete development workflows.

## Repository Justfile Commands

For developers working on the vibetuner repository itself, the root justfile provides commands for
managing the monorepo.

Run `just` to see all available commands.

### Dependencies

```bash
just update-all              # Update all package dependencies (py, js, template, root)
just update-and-commit       # Update all dependencies and commit changes
just update-py               # Update Python dependencies in vibetuner-py
just update-js               # Update JavaScript dependencies in vibetuner-js
just update-template         # Update dependencies in vibetuner-template
just update-root             # Update root scaffolding dependencies
just sync-jinja              # Refresh vibetuner-jinja/templates from vibetuner-py
```

The `sync-jinja` recipe mirrors `vibetuner-py/src/vibetuner/templates/frontend/`
into `vibetuner-jinja/templates/`, the npm package that ships the framework's
core jinja templates so tailwind can `@source` them at frontend build time. The
same script runs as the package's `prepare` lifecycle hook, so workspace `bun
install` and `npm publish` keep things in sync automatically — `just sync-jinja`
is just the manual entry point.

### Documentation

```bash
just docs-serve              # Serve documentation locally with live reload
just docs-build              # Build documentation site
```

### Code Quality

```bash
just format                  # Format all code (Python, Jinja, TOML, YAML)
just format-py               # Format Python with ruff
just format-jinja            # Format Jinja templates with djlint
just format-toml             # Format TOML files with taplo
just format-yaml             # Format YAML files with dprint

just lint                    # Run all linting checks
just lint-gh                 # Lint GitHub Actions workflows with actionlint
just lint-py                 # Lint Python with ruff
just lint-jinja              # Lint Jinja with djlint
just lint-md                 # Lint markdown files
just lint-toml               # Lint TOML with taplo
just lint-yaml               # Lint YAML with dprint
just type-check              # Type check Python with ty
```

### Testing (vibetuner-py)

Dev dependencies (pytest, pytest-asyncio) are declared as an optional extra in
`vibetuner-py/pyproject.toml`. You must install them before running tests:

```bash
cd vibetuner-py
uv sync --extra dev
uv run python -m pytest tests/          # run all tests
uv run python -m pytest tests/unit/     # run unit tests only
```

### Template Management

```bash
just update-frontend-templates  # Sync frontend templates and commit changes
```

## Beanie (MongoDB ODM)

### Document.get() accepts plain strings

Beanie's `Document.get()` accepts `Any` for `document_id`, so wrapping IDs with
`PydanticObjectId()` is unnecessary:

```python
# Correct - pass the string directly
doc = await MyDocument.get(some_id)

# Unnecessary - PydanticObjectId wrapping adds no value here
doc = await MyDocument.get(PydanticObjectId(some_id))
```

`PydanticObjectId` is still useful as a FastAPI path parameter type annotation (for request
validation) and in explicit query filters, but `.get()` handles the conversion internally.

### Event hook methods must NOT start with an underscore

Beanie's `init_actions()` skips any method whose name starts with `_` when registering
`@before_event` / `@after_event` hooks. A hook named `_encrypt_on_save` will silently
never fire. Always use public names:

```python
# Correct - Beanie discovers and registers this hook
@before_event(Insert)
def encrypt_on_insert(self) -> None: ...

# Wrong - silently ignored by Beanie's action registry
@before_event(Insert)
def _encrypt_on_insert(self) -> None: ...
```

### Ad-hoc collection access uses PyMongo, not Motor

The project uses `pymongo` (not `motor`). For direct collection access, use
`get_pymongo_collection()`:

```python
# Correct
collection = MyDocument.get_pymongo_collection()

# Wrong - motor was removed, this no longer exists
collection = MyDocument.get_motor_collection()  # AttributeError
```

## Logging

All code in `vibetuner-py/src/vibetuner/` must use the project's Loguru-based logger:

```python
from vibetuner.logging import logger
```

Do **not** use `import logging` or `logging.getLogger(...)` directly. The only exception is
`vibetuner/logging.py` itself, which defines the logging facility and necessarily imports the
stdlib `logging` module.

The `InterceptHandler` in `vibetuner/logging.py` routes stdlib logging through Loguru, so
third-party libraries still work. But framework code should always use the Loguru `logger`
directly for consistent formatting, request-ID injection, and log-level control.

## Markdown Line Length

This project enforces a **120 character line limit** for markdown files using `rumdl`.

When editing markdown files:

- Keep lines under 120 characters
- Break long lines at natural points (commas, list items, sentence boundaries)
- Indent continuation lines consistently with their parent items
- Pre-commit hooks will catch violations before commit

Example of properly wrapped markdown:

```markdown
1. Stage all relevant changes:
   - **IMPORTANT**: NEVER stage release-related files: `.release-please-manifest.json`,
     `CHANGELOG.md`, version changes in `pyproject.toml` or `package.json`
   - Use `git add` with explicit file paths for each file you want to commit
```
