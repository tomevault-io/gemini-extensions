## CHANGELOG.md Markdown Formatting

**Markdown linting usage:**
- Run `npx markdownlint CHANGELOG.md` to validate all formatting rules before committing
- The repository includes `.markdownlintrc` configuration that enforces changelog-specific rules

**.markdownlintrc configuration:**
- `MD013`: Line length limit of 120 characters (vs. default 80) to accommodate detailed technical changelog entries
- `MD024`: `siblings_only: true` - Prevents duplicate section headings (e.g., multiple `### Fixed`) within the same release version. Allows the same heading across different versions, which is normal for changelogs

**CHANGELOG.md formatting rules:**
1. **No duplicate headings within a version** - Each release (`## [X.Y.Z]`) should have at most one of each section heading type (`### Fixed`, `### Added`, `### Changed`, etc.). If your changes span multiple categories, consolidate them under a single section heading with multiple bullet items. This rule is enforced by MD024 with `siblings_only: true`.
2. **Blank lines around section headings** - Every heading (`### Fixed`, `### Added`, `### Changed`, `### Performance`, `### Infrastructure`, etc.) should be surrounded by blank lines (one before, one after).
3. **Blank lines around code fences** - All code blocks (triple backticks) should be surrounded by blank lines.
4. **Line length** - Keep lines reasonably wrapped for readability; long bullet items should wrap to multiple indented lines instead of becoming hard to review. The 120-character limit allows technical explanations to stay together without excessive wrapping.
5. **Long bullet wrapping pattern** - Convert long single-line items like:

   ```
   - **Item** - [500+ char explanation with multiple concepts]
   ```

   To indented multi-line format:

   ```
   - **Item** - [Explanation line 1]
     [Explanation line 2 indented by 2 spaces]
     [Explanation line 3 indented by 2 spaces]
   ```

6. **No spaces inside code spans** - Code spans must not have spaces between backticks and content: `` `code` `` not `` ` code ` ``.
7. **Run `markdownlint` before committing** - Always verify no violations remain: `npx markdownlint CHANGELOG.md`

## Docs Changelog Sync

**Keep `docs/changelog.md` in sync with root `CHANGELOG.md`.** The docs site file serves as a curated summary for visitors - it should always contain brief highlights of the **last 5 releases** only. After each release:

1. Add a new `### X.Y.Z - Brief Title` section at the top of the "Recent highlights" block in `docs/changelog.md`
2. Extract 3-5 key bullet points from the root `CHANGELOG.md` for that release (focus on user-facing features and major fixes)
3. Keep descriptions brief (1-2 lines per item, no wrapped multi-line format)
4. Remove the oldest release entry to maintain the "last 5 releases" limit
5. No markdown linting required for `docs/changelog.md` - it's documentation, not a strict changelog

Example format:
```markdown
### 0.25.0 - New theme support

- Added 10 new built-in themes (Dracula, Solarized, etc.)
- Fixed WebView crash on Android 12 devices
- Improved theme parsing performance by 40%
```

## Architecture

The library has two layers — `engine/` (public engine API, with `engine/internal/` for
implementation) and `ui/` (public composables, with `ui/internal/` for
implementation):

```
SyntaxHighlightedCode   ← primary public composable
 └── rememberHighlightedCode (ui/RememberHighlightedCode.kt)
       └── rememberHighlightEngine (ui/RememberHighlightEngine.kt)
             └── HighlightEngine                       ← public, suspend-based pipeline
                   ├── engine/internal/WebViewManager           ← owns the hidden WebView
                   ├── HighlightTheme                           ← public, CSS-backed theme model
                   │     └── engine/internal/ThemeParser        ← CSS → Map<selector, SpanStyle>
                   ├── engine/internal/HtmlToAnnotatedString    ← HtmlParser → AnnotatedString
                   ├── engine/internal/JsStringEscape           ← escapeForJs / unescapeJsString
                   └── engine/internal/EngineErrorHandling      ← withEngine* / withHtmlParsing* helpers

SyntaxHighlightedTextEditor  ← experimental editor composable
 └── rememberSyntaxHighlightedEditorValue (ui/RememberSyntaxHighlightedEditorValue.kt)
       └── ui/internal/applySnapshotSpans  ← span-transfer during debounce

HighlightThemeProvider  ← creates ONE shared HighlightEngine for its subtree
 └── ui/internal/LocalHighlightEngine (CompositionLocal) ← carries the shared engine
 └── LocalHighlightTheme  (public CompositionLocal)      ← carries the active theme
```

Anything under an `internal/` package keeps the `internal` Kotlin visibility modifier
so it cannot be referenced from outside the module. The package path is the
human-readable signal; the modifier is the enforcement. Dokka suppresses
`*.internal*` packages from the published API site.

**How highlighting works end-to-end:**
1. `WebViewManager` creates a hidden (off-screen) `WebView` on the Main thread and loads `bridge.html` from `assets/compose-highlight/`. This page loads `highlight.min.js` and exposes `highlightCode(code, lang)`.
2. `HighlightEngine` serializes calls with a `Mutex` and calls `evaluateJavascript()` to invoke `highlightCode`, getting back HTML with `<span class="hljs-*">` tokens.
3. `ThemeParser` lazily parses a Highlight.js CSS file into a `Map<String, SpanStyle>` (selector → style), cached per `HighlightTheme` instance.
4. `HtmlToAnnotatedString` uses `HtmlParser` to parse the HTML and applies the theme's `SpanStyle` map to produce a Compose `AnnotatedString`.

**Shared engine via `HighlightThemeProvider`:** The provider creates a single `HighlightEngine` (one hidden WebView) for its entire subtree and exposes it via the internal `LocalHighlightEngine` CompositionLocal. `rememberHighlightEngine()` reads it when inside the provider - no extra WebView is created. Outside the provider, `rememberHighlightEngine()` creates a standalone engine that it destroys itself via `DisposableEffect`. This means N code blocks inside a provider share 1 WebView instead of N.

**Why `https://appassets.androidplatform.net`:** `WebViewAssetLoader` intercepts requests to this reserved fake domain and maps `/assets/` to the app's `assets/` folder. This is required because `file://` URLs block `<script>` execution via Same-Origin Policy.

## Key conventions

**Public vs internal:** Public API consists of the `ui/` package plus the public `engine/` declarations used by it:
`HighlightEngine`, `HighlightTheme`, `HighlightException`, `HighlightResult`, `ThemedHighlightResult`,
`AutoHighlightResult`, `HtmlHighlightResult`, `HighlightTimings`, `HighlightLanguage`, `HighlightLanguageInfo`,
and `HljsSelectors`. All implementation helpers under `engine/internal/` (`WebViewManager`, `ThemeParser`,
`HtmlToAnnotatedString`, `JsStringEscape`, `EngineErrorHandling`) and `ui/internal/` are `internal` and not
part of the supported public surface.

**`android.util.Log` is banned from the library.** Any `Log.*` call in code paths executed by JVM unit tests causes `RuntimeException: Method d in android.util.Log not mocked`. Remove all debug logging before committing.

**All `HighlightEngine` results use `Result<T>`.** Never throw from public engine methods; wrap failures in `Result.failure(HighlightException(...))`. `HighlightException` is a sealed class - add new variants there rather than throwing raw exceptions.

**Always use `applicationContext`.** Never pass an Activity `Context` to `HighlightEngine` or `HighlightTheme` factory functions - both hold the context beyond the Activity's lifecycle (the engine in `WebViewManager`, the theme in its `colorMapProvider` lambda). Always call `context.applicationContext` at the call site.

**WebView must run on the Main thread.** `WebViewManager.initialize()` and `destroy()` dispatch to `Dispatchers.Main` and `Handler(Looper.getMainLooper())` respectively. Never call WebView APIs off the Main thread.

**`rememberHighlightEngine()` for lifecycle management.** In Compose, always use `rememberHighlightEngine()` (not bare `HighlightEngine(context)`). When called inside `HighlightThemeProvider`, it returns the provider's shared engine (no extra WebView, no extra lifecycle handling). When called outside a provider, it creates a standalone engine and destroys it via `DisposableEffect` when the composable leaves composition.

**`SyntaxHighlightedCode` requires a theme.** Its `theme` parameter defaults to `LocalHighlightTheme.current`, which throws if no `HighlightThemeProvider` ancestor exists. Always wrap usage in `HighlightThemeProvider { }` or pass an explicit `theme =` argument.

**`HighlightTheme` is lazy.** CSS parsing happens on first use of `colorMap`, not at factory-call time. This means `fromAsset()` errors surface when the theme is first applied, not when the factory is called.

**Formatting:** ktlint via `org.jmailen.kotlinter`. The `.editorconfig` suppresses the function-naming rule for `@Composable`-annotated functions (`ktlint_function_naming_ignore_when_annotated_with = Composable`). Run `./gradlew formatKotlin` before committing.

**JVM unit tests vs instrumented tests:** `src/test/` contains JVM tests (fast, no device needed). Use `ThemeParser.parse(cssString)` for theme tests and call `unescapeJsString(...)` directly for unescape tests - both work without Android mocks. Use [Google Truth](https://github.com/google/truth) (`com.google.truth:truth`) for assertions in new tests. `src/androidTest/` contains instrumented tests (`HighlightEngineTest`) and microbenchmarks (`benchmark/`) that require a connected device and use `BenchmarkRule`.

**Asset path convention:** All library assets live under `assets/compose-highlight/` to avoid collisions when the library is consumed. CSS themes go in `assets/compose-highlight/themes/`.

**Keep CHANGELOG.md up to date.** For every PR or commit that adds a feature, fixes a bug, or makes a breaking change, add an entry under the relevant `[Unreleased]` section in `CHANGELOG.md` at the repo root. When cutting a release, rename `[Unreleased]` to the version number with the date.

**KDoc is required on all public API.** Dokka API docs are generated from KDoc and published to GitHub Pages (`.github/workflows/docs.yml`). Every public class, function, and property in `ui/` and the public `engine/` classes must have KDoc. Include at least one usage example (triple-backtick code block) on non-trivial classes and composables. Internal classes do not need KDoc but benefit from it.

**Git workflow - always create new commits.** Never use `git commit --amend`, `git push --force`, `git push --force-with-lease`, or similar rewriting operations. Always create a new commit for any changes. This keeps commit history clean, preserves attribution, and prevents accidental data loss. If changes are needed after pushing, create a new commit with a descriptive message (e.g., "fix: address code review feedback in X").

**GitHub workflow - prefer `gh` CLI for GitHub operations.** Use the [`gh`](https://cli.github.com/) GitHub CLI for reading issues, viewing PRs, checking release notes, inspecting Actions runs, and creating PRs. Do not try to fetch GitHub page content by hitting `https://github.com/...` URLs directly with generic web/HTTP fetch tools when `gh` can provide the data. Prefer commands like `gh issue view`, `gh pr view`, `gh release view`, `gh run view`, and `gh pr create`.

**PR titles should describe the change directly.** Do not prefix PR titles with `[codex]`, agent names, or similar tooling labels. Use a normal descriptive title with the appropriate change type such as `fix: ...`, `remove: ...`, `add: ...`, `docs: ...`, or `chore: ...`.

**Pull requests must be created in draft mode first.** When opening a PR, always create it as a draft unless the user explicitly asks for a ready-for-review PR. This applies to regular fix branches and release branches.

**Before every commit - verify stability.** Run the following three tasks and ensure they all pass:
```bash
./gradlew formatKotlin                          # auto-fix formatting
./gradlew :compose-highlight:assembleDebug :sample:assembleDebug  # both must build
./gradlew :compose-highlight:test               # all JVM unit tests must pass
```
Do not commit if any of these fail.

**Git tags must not use a `v` prefix.** Use `0.3.0`, not `v0.3.0`. Maven Central uses the tag as the dependency version (via `-PVERSION_NAME=<tag>` in the publish workflow), so the version string consumers write in their `build.gradle.kts` matches the tag exactly.

**Before tagging a release - use the release script to update all version references atomically:**
```bash
./scripts/prepare-release.sh <new-version>
# Example: ./scripts/prepare-release.sh 0.18.0
```
This script updates all seven required files in one step:
- `gradle.properties` - `VERSION_NAME`
- `README.md` - dependency snippet
- `docs/index.md` - dependency snippet
- `docs/getting-started.md` - dependency snippet
- `sample/build.gradle.kts` - `versionName` and auto-incremented `versionCode`
- `pyproject.toml` - `version` (keeps docs dependencies in sync with library release)
- `CHANGELOG.md` - `[Unreleased]` renamed to `[X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD`

Never update these files manually one-by-one - always use the script to avoid missing files.

**After running the script, update `docs/changelog.md`** - add a new `### X.Y.Z - Brief Title` section at the top of the "Recent highlights" block with 3-5 key bullet points extracted from the root `CHANGELOG.md` for that release. Remove the oldest entry to keep only the last 5 releases. See the "Docs Changelog Sync" section above for the exact format.

After running the script, create a release branch, run all checks, commit, push, and open a PR into `main` (direct pushes to `main` are blocked by branch protection):
```bash
git checkout -b release/<new-version>
./gradlew formatKotlin :compose-highlight:assembleDebug :sample:assembleDebug :compose-highlight:test
git add -A && git commit -m "chore: prepare release <new-version>"
git push -u origin release/<new-version>
gh pr create --draft --title "chore: prepare release <new-version>" --base main
```

Only create the git tag **after the release PR is merged** and `main` is pulled:
```bash
git checkout main && git pull
git tag <new-version> && git push origin <new-version>
```

**Publishing to Maven Central is a manual two-step workflow - it is NOT triggered automatically by pushing a tag.** After tagging:
1. Manually trigger the publish GitHub Actions workflow in **dry-run mode** first and verify it passes.
2. Only if the dry run succeeds, trigger the workflow again **without dry-run** to actually publish to Maven Central.

Never tell the user "the publish workflow will trigger automatically" - it won't.

**Release notes format** - after a git tag is pushed, automatically provide brief release notes in markdown format without waiting for the user to ask. Keep it concise - 3-5 key bullet points max, focusing on user-facing changes. Example:
```markdown
## 0.22.1

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed resource leak: InputStream in ThemeParser now properly closed when loading CSS assets
- Fixed scroll position persistence when code snippet changes

### Performance
- Improved recomposition efficiency in LazyColumn scenarios by stabilizing internal lambda instances

**Dependency:** `dev.hossain:compose-highlight:0.22.1`
```

**Automated Release APK workflow** - when a git tag is pushed, the `.github/workflows/android-release.yml` job automatically runs and attaches the Release APK to the GitHub Release. No need to build APK manually anymore.

**Dependency coordinates (Maven Central):**
```
dev.hossain:compose-highlight:<version>
```

**Updating bundled highlight.js themes in the sample app** - to refresh the 256 `.min.css` theme files under `sample/src/main/assets/themes/` (e.g. when upgrading highlight.js), follow the steps in [`resources/updating-hljs-themes.md`](../resources/updating-hljs-themes.md).

**Writing style - never use the em dash `-` character** in commit messages, code comments, KDoc, CHANGELOG entries, or any other text. Use a regular hyphen/minus `-` instead.

## Reference docs authoring

The `docs/reference/` pages are human-facing guides, while Dokka is the source of truth for exhaustive API details.

- Keep in `docs/reference/`: when to use an API, usage patterns, examples, and pitfalls.
- Avoid duplicating full signatures, parameter tables, property tables, or method lists that Dokka already provides.
- Include a "Full API in Dokka" link near the top of each reference page.
- Validate docs changes with `zensical build --clean` and fix all link or anchor warnings before merging.

## Docs site

The documentation site at https://hossain-khan.github.io/android-compose-highlight/ is built with two tools:

- **Zensical** (v0.0.43) - Static site generator for the main docs (Markdown in `docs/`). Configured via `zensical.toml`.
- **Dokka** - Generates the Kotlin API reference under `docs/api/`, rethemed to match the Zensical chrome via `compose-highlight/dokka-theme/`.

**Local preview:**
```bash
# Zensical docs site (main docs)
zensical serve
# Open http://localhost:8000

# Dokka API reference (must serve over HTTP, not file://)
./gradlew :compose-highlight:dokkaGenerate
cd docs && python3 -m http.server 8765
# Open http://localhost:8765/api/index.html
```

**Dokka retheme** (`compose-highlight/dokka-theme/`):
- `dokka-zensical-chrome.js` - Injects Material-style header, sidebar, and footer around Dokka's content. Includes a "Back to Docs" link in the sidebar pointing to `../index.html`. All sidebar items are expanded by default.
- `zensical-overrides.css` - Overrides Dokka's CSS variables to match Zensical's light/dark schemes.
- `zensical-assets/` - Frozen copies of Zensical's Material CSS bundles (pinned by hash).
- The palette toggle is synced between Zensical (`/`) and Dokka (`/api/`) via a shared localStorage key.

**CI workflow** (`.github/workflows/docs.yml`): Generates Dokka API docs, builds Zensical site, deploys `site/` to GitHub Pages.

**Updating Zensical CSS assets:** When Zensical is upgraded, copy the new hashed CSS files from `site/assets/stylesheets/modern/` into `compose-highlight/dokka-theme/zensical-assets/` and update the references in `compose-highlight/build.gradle.kts`. See `compose-highlight/dokka-theme/README.md` for the full refresh procedure.
