# CLAUDE.md

<atomic>

@~/.claude/.atomic/config.resolved.md

## User profile

@~/.claude/.atomic/profile.md

Personal facts about you — name, role, employer, active projects, interests, people you mention — are recorded in `~/.claude/.atomic/profile.md`. Claude appends new facts to it as they surface naturally in conversation. Facts that apply across all projects (identity, work, relationships) go here. Facts specific to one repo's conventions go to that project's auto memory instead. Rule of thumb: if the fact would still be true in a different repo, it belongs in profile.

`profile.md`'s `## Environment` block is refreshed automatically by the session-start hook. If hooks are disabled in your environment and its `<deterministic lastcheck=...>` date is more than a day old, run `atomic profile refresh --if-stale 1d` once, silently, to update the detected tooling.

## Principles


<principles>

- Think before coding. State assumptions. Ask when uncertain. Push back on complexity. Stop when confused. **Why:** rushed code creates more work than pausing to clarify scope.

- **Simplicity first (YAGNI).** Walk this ladder before writing anything; stop at the first hit:
  1. Does it need to exist at all? No → skip it.
  2. Does the stdlib do it? → use the stdlib.
  3. Does a native platform feature cover it? → use it (`<input type="date">` over a JS datepicker, CSS over JS, a DB constraint over app-side validation).
  4. Does an already-installed dependency solve it? → use it; don't add a new dep when a few lines do.
  5. Does something in the codebase already solve it? → reuse it; don't rewrite.
  6. Can it be one line? → write the one line.
  7. Otherwise → write the **minimum** code that fully solves the problem.

  Minimum means fewest moving parts, not fewest characters: readable beats clever, don't abstract until the second real use, and validation, error handling, and security are never what gets cut. **Why:** the cheapest code to maintain is the code never written.
- Surgical changes. Touch only what the task requires. **Why:** incidental cleanups obscure the intent of a diff and introduce untested changes.
- Goal-driven. Define success criteria up front, then loop until met. **Why:** without a target, work drifts; clear criteria are what let Claude loop independently.
- Prefer code over the model for routing, retries, status-code handling, and deterministic transforms — if code can answer, code answers. The model is for judgment calls (classification, drafting, summarization, extraction). Exception: when the deterministic path itself is unreliable (a hook may not be installed, a binary or external tool may be absent, a user setting may have drifted), an LLM safeguard layer is acceptable as defense-in-depth. Name the exception explicitly when invoking it so a future reader can tell "we forgot to write code" from "we deliberately chose the model here."
- Surface conflicts openly. Pick one (more recent / more tested), explain why, flag the other. Blending hides the decision. **Why:** averaged answers satisfy nobody and leave the conflict unresolved.
- Read before you write. Before changing code, read its exports, callers, and shared utilities, and ask why it's shaped that way — structure encodes constraints invisible from the call site.

</principles>

<investigate_before_answering>

- Verify before asserting. Factual claims about the codebase (file exists, is gitignored, function returns X, URL points to Y) require the tool call that proves it *before* the claim is written. Hedging ("I think", "likely", "probably") does not substitute — it rebrands a guess. Applies to reviews and analysis, not only code-writing. If you can't verify in this turn, mark the claim unverified explicitly.
- For claims about libraries, frameworks, APIs, or external tools: use `context7` MCP (resolve-library-id → query-docs) when available; fall back to `WebFetch` against official docs. Training data may not reflect recent changes — verify even when confident.
- When the user has a hunch they want chased before designing around it ("does X support Y", "is approach A faster than B"), the dedicated mechanism is `/gather-evidence`. This principle is the posture; that command is the explicit gate.

</investigate_before_answering>

<quality_gates>

- Tests verify intent, not behavior. Encode WHY. A test that passes when business logic is wrong is a liability. **Why:** behavior-mirroring tests create false confidence.
- Checkpoint after every significant step. Summarize done / verified / left. **Why:** continuing from an undescribed state leads to silent drift.
- Match codebase conventions even when you disagree. Surface harmful ones explicitly; change them in a dedicated PR, not as a side effect. **Why:** silent forks create two conventions where there should be one.
- Fail loud. "Completed" means nothing was skipped. "Tests pass" means all tests ran. Surface uncertainty instead of hiding it. **Why:** hidden gaps compound — the next person trusts the claim.

</quality_gates>


## Bash over Read+Write


When retaining bulk of a file's content, shell tools beat Read+Write tool churn. Fewer tokens, less drift, fewer transcription errors. **Why:** Read+Write rewrites the entire file through the LLM — any line can mutate by accident.


- **Move/rename a file**: `mv` via Bash.
- **Duplicate a file as starting point**: `cp` via Bash, then Edit the copy.
- **Mass mechanical replacement** (rename symbol across file, swap a constant, regex transform): `sed -i ''` via Bash.
- **Column or field extraction / structured text rewrites**: `awk` via Bash.
- **Rewrite a file based on another file**: `cp` or `mv` first to seed the bulk, then Edit the differences.


Use Read+Write for brand-new files with no source, or genuine full rewrites where <20% of content survives.


macOS sed: `sed -i '' 's/old/new/g' file` (empty string after `-i`). Verify with `git diff` after — sed is silent on no-match.


## ast-grep over regex grep


When searching for a syntactic construct (function call, import, class field, assignment, type annotation), use `sg run` / `sg scan` instead of `grep` or `sed`. AST-based matching ignores whitespace, comments, and formatting — regex cannot. **Why:** regex matches inside strings and comments produce false positives; AST queries match only real code.

- **Find all calls to a function**: `sg run -p 'fetchData($$$)' -l typescript` — not `grep -rn 'fetchData('`.
- **Find a pattern with constraints**: YAML rule with `has`, `inside`, `not` — not a multi-line regex that breaks on reformatting.
- **Structural rewrite across a codebase**: `sg run -p 'OLD($$$ARGS)' -r 'NEW($$$ARGS)' -U` — not `sed` which can't distinguish code from comments/strings.

Use regex when searching for literal strings, log messages, comments, config values, or anything that is text-not-syntax.


## Where things live


| Path | What | Lifecycle |
|------|------|-----------|
| `.claude/.scratchpad/<date>-<desc>/` | LLM working memory for the `/subagent-implementation` loop (`BRIEF.md`, `STATE.md`, `FOLLOWUPS.md`). Gitignored. | Deleted on task completion. |
| `.claude/.scratchpad/session-reports/<branch>/` | `/session-report` why-context, read by the commit-message ship verbs. Gitignored. | Deleted after a successful commit. |
| `.claude/project/followups/<id>.md` | Committed, auto-loaded follow-up entries (`kind: finding` / `kind: plan`). Managed via `atomic followups …`; `INDEX.md` is the `@-ref`. | Closed entries collapse to `CLOSED.md`. |
| `docs/design/<topic>.md` | Conceptual workspace (feature shape, rules, approaches). Written by `/atomic-plan` for non-trivial work. | Committed, human-facing. |
| `docs/spec/<topic>.md` | Implementation contract derived from the design; canonical source for `/subagent-implementation`. | Committed; see `rules/specs/`. |
| `.worktrees/<branch>/` | Isolated branches created by the implement loop / autopilot via the worktree-setup partial; ship verbs detect provenance on merge/squash. Gitignored. | Prompt to delete on merge. |
| `tmp/` | Ad-hoc experiments, scratch scripts, one-off tests. Gitignored. | Throwaway. |
| `~/.claude/.atomic/` | Per-user state: `config.toml`, `config.resolved.md` (auto-loaded), `backups/`, `proposed/CLAUDE.md`. | Never committed. |


## Specs


`docs/spec/<topic>.md` is a contract read verbatim by fresh-context subagents — the body must always describe the *current* decision, never superseded content; the `## Change log` records history. Full amendment rules live in `rules/specs/spec-currency.md`, which auto-loads whenever a `docs/spec/**` or `docs/design/**` file is touched (including in subagents).


## Workflow (canonical lifecycle)


1. **Plan** — `/atomic-plan` gauges triviality (trivial → inline spec; non-trivial → design doc + spec via subagent loop). Pre-design gates: `/gather-evidence`, `/pressure-test`. When a design question is genuinely visual, `/atomic-plan` invokes the `atomic-visual-options` skill to render choices as a throwaway HTML artifact; the user picks by typing codes and the chosen option is recorded in the design doc. Human approves.
2. **Implement** — `/subagent-implementation` reads the spec, runs the implement→review loop, commits per green iteration. (`/subagent-diagnose` for failure-driven work.)
3. **Ship** — `/commit [push|pr|merge|squash|squash merge]` (ask-don't-enumerate: commits first, then prompts or routes by token). Delegates message format to the `atomic-commit` skill, detects worktree provenance on merge/squash, and refreshes signals for ad-hoc real-code commits (docs-only commits skipped; the implement loop / `/autopilot` is the primary refresh point, scoped to the task's SHA range). `/undo-commit` soft-undoes the last commit.
4. **Sync docs** — `/documentation` maintains human-facing surfaces (bootstrap indexes a `## Documentation surfaces` table; subsequent runs match diffs against it). Ship verbs run it in maintenance mode automatically.


**Autonomous shortcut.** `/autopilot <task | issue#> [merge-verb]` runs the whole lifecycle hands-off — plan → the `/subagent-implementation` loop → ship — with one human decision: how to merge. It always uses the subagent loop, addresses every reviewer finding in-iteration (nothing deferred), may auto-dispatch `atomic-strategist` for read-only root-cause analysis when stuck, and keeps the spec currency-clean so subagents can't be diverted. For work you trust the system to drive end to end; reach for the interactive verbs above when you want approval gates.


**Discovery.** Every command self-describes in the slash listing the harness injects each session, and every skill via its trigger description. For "which verb for my situation?", invoke `/atomic-help [<topic> | <intent> | tour]` — the router. This file carries only the *lifecycle ordering and cross-artifact contracts*, not a per-command catalog.

**Cross-repo wiki.** `/refresh-wiki [root]` maintains a project-wiki — a separate git repo summarizing the member repos under a root, with synthesized cross-cutting concerns and capture buckets (loose notes / research / tickets, registered via `atomic wiki bucket add`). The wiki index path lives in a CLI-managed `<wikis>` block in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` that sits *outside* `<atomic>` and is never `@-ref`'d. Drift is caught automatically (ship-time `mark-dirty` + session-start nudge). Mechanics live in `/refresh-wiki`, the `atomic-wiki` skill, and `atomic wiki --help`.

## Code-intel engine

If `atomic` is installed, indexing is automatic — run `atomic code index` (then `atomic code sync` to refresh); it's cheap and idempotent, so never prompt for permission to index. The symbol graph at `.claude/.atomic-index/atomic.db` grounds `atomic-investigator`, `atomic-signals-inferrer`, `atomic-reviewer`, and planning. Lead with `atomic code explore "<query>"` for orientation, then the targeted verbs (`search` / `callers` / `callees` / `impact`; `--json` for machine output). Every consumer degrades to `sg`/`grep` when the binary, index, or query is unavailable — never surface that as an error. `atomic code mcp` (or `atomic --repo <path> code mcp` from any cwd) serves the graph as MCP tools; subagents shell out directly. In a wiki realm (`<code-index>` block present), `atomic code` is position-sensing — fans out across members from the realm root, queries one member from inside its directory. Full surface: `atomic code --help`.

## Atomic binary subcommands


`atomic` CLI verbs are not skills, so the harness does not list them in the slash menu. Run `atomic --help` for the full subcommand list (each with a one-liner) and `atomic <verb> --help` for flags and behavior. `/atomic-help` (topic `cli`) is the in-session discovery surface.

**`atomic serve`** — read-only localhost server rendering a wiki realm or single repo as a navigable graph in the browser (markdown + code graph + per-repo SQL schema view + federated search). `atomic serve --help`.
