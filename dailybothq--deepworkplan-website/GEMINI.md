## Project Overview

**Deep Work Plan** ([deepworkplan.com](https://deepworkplan.com)) — The official website for the Deep Work Plan (DWP) methodology: the methodology that turns any repository into an **AI-first, agent-pilotable** codebase. DWP documents a repo (AGENTS.md, docs, `.agents/` skills, the DWP skill), enables **long-horizon plans**, and lets **any agent pilot the repo** against explicit acceptance criteria and validation gates. A serious, neutral, fast documentation-and-marketing site built with Astro, in the **"Broadsheet" editorial design system** (warm paper, ink serif display, hairline rules, restrained oxblood accent), with dark mode, multilingual content in 17 languages (en, es, pt, zh, ja, de, fr, ko, ru, it, tr, id, vi, hi, pl, uk, th), static site architecture deployed to Cloudflare Pages.

The site explains and positions the DWP methodology, hosts the readable specification and kit catalog, ships agent-friendly Markdown endpoints, and exposes a canonical adoption endpoint at **`/init`**. The repository **dogfoods** the methodology it documents.

**Positioning — two narrative pillars** (weave through all copy):

1. **Spec-driven development (SDD).** The plan/spec is the durable source of truth; agents execute against explicit acceptance criteria and validation gates (reduces drift, enables verification, survives across sessions/agents). DWP's plan → atomic tasks → gates → completion loop *is* SDD — and unlike tool-bound SDD (GitHub Spec Kit, Amazon Kiro, Tessl), DWP is **tool-agnostic and repo-native**.
2. **Harness engineering — the repository is the harness.** DWP delivers the agent scaffolding (context, tools, control loop, guardrails, state/resumability) as a **portable methodology + kit installed into the repository**, not a per-tool framework — so any agent can pilot any repo. One-liner: *"Deep Work Plan is spec-driven development where the repository itself becomes the harness."*

**Companion skill repo:** the site is paired with **[`DailybotHQ/deepworkplan-skill`](https://github.com/DailybotHQ/deepworkplan-skill)** (DWP packaged as an installable agent skill). Adoption messaging (the `/init` endpoint, methodology, and kit) stays in sync with that repo: install the skill → onboard the agent → generate and execute long-horizon plans. Do **not** attribute the DWP name to any external author or popular-productivity source; the DWP name stands on its own (focused, long-horizon agent execution). Design-system reference: **[Brand Guide](docs/BRAND_GUIDE.md)** (palette + serif type + editorial primitives in `src/components/editorial/`).

**Content model:** methodology documentation is primary, paired with the specification reader and kit catalog. The blog engine, slides/tech-talks, and personal pages have been removed — this is a focused methodology-and-marketing site.

**Technology Stack:**

- **Astro 7.0.8** — Static site generator (islands architecture; Rust compiler + Sätteri Markdown)
- **Svelte 5.56.4** — Interactive components
- **TypeScript 6.0.3** — Type-safe development
- **Tailwind CSS 4.3.2** — Utility-first styling with dark mode
- **Biome 2.5.3** — Linter and formatter (replaces ESLint + Prettier)
- **MDX** — Enhanced Markdown for content collections (via `@astrojs/markdown-satteri` / Sätteri)

```

## Temporary Workspace (`tmp/`)

The `tmp/` directory at the project root is a **git-ignored scratch space** for agents and developers.

**Use it for:**
- Temporary prompts, outputs, or drafts
- One-off analysis results or debug logs
- Any ephemeral file that should NOT be committed

**Rules:**
- Everything inside `tmp/` is ignored by git (except `.gitkeep`)
- Do NOT store anything permanent or important here — it can be deleted at any time
- When a user asks for a temporary file, prompt output, or scratch artifact, **write it to `tmp/`**
- Subdirectories are fine (e.g., `tmp/prompts/`, `tmp/analysis/`)

## Skills, Commands, and Agents (`.agents/`)

The `.agents/` directory is the **canonical, cross-agent home** for everything that defines how AI assistants behave in this repo: skills, slash commands, agent definitions, internal documentation, and settings. The same content is consumed by Claude Code, Cursor AI, OpenAI Codex, Gemini, and any other coding agent that picks up local skills/commands.

```
.agents/
├── agents/        # Agent definitions (architect, executor, reviewer, ...)
├── commands/      # Slash commands (commit, pr, branch, dwp-*, ...)
├── skills/        # Skill procedures (fix-lint, translate-sync, ...)
├── docs/          # Catalogs and references (skills_agents_catalog.md, COMMANDS_REFERENCE.md)
├── README.md      # Conventions for authoring skills, agents, and commands
├── settings.json           # Claude Code env (env vars, experimental flags)
└── settings.local.json     # Claude Code local permissions (git-tracked)
```

**Backward compatibility — `.claude/` and `.cursor/` symlinks:**

Claude Code historically reads from `.claude/` and Cursor from `.cursor/` at the repo root. To keep both working without duplicating files, **both are symlinks to `.agents`**:

```bash
ls -la .claude .cursor
# .claude -> .agents
# .cursor -> .agents
```

This means every `.claude/...` or `.cursor/...` path (e.g., `.claude/skills/foo/SKILL.md`, `.cursor/hooks.json`) resolves transparently to `.agents/`. No tool, hook, or settings file needs to change for either agent to keep working.

**Authoring rules (all agents):**

- Use `.agents/...` as the canonical path in **all new documentation, prompts, and skill/command files**. Do not write `.claude/...` or `.cursor/...` in new content.
- Do not edit files via the `.claude/` or `.cursor/` symlinks — edit the real files under `.agents/`.
- Settings files (`settings.json`, `settings.local.json`) are Claude Code-specific but live in `.agents/` for symmetry. They're a no-op for other agents.
- The `.agents/README.md` documents how to add new skills, commands, and agents.

**Why the rename?** The `.agents/` name signals that the folder is shared across agents, matching the project-level `AGENTS.md` convention (which is itself the canonical file that `CLAUDE.md` symlinks to). It avoids implying that the contents are Claude-only.

## CRITICAL: Mandatory Requirements

### 1. Language Standards

**ALL code, comments, and documentation MUST be in English.** Always update documentation after important changes.

### 2. Orthography & Diacritical Marks (MANDATORY)

**All user-facing text MUST use proper orthography.** Spanish content MUST include ñ (e.g., pequeño, diseño, español), accented vowels (e.g., análisis, código, página, versión), and interrogative accents (e.g., cómo, qué, cuál).

**Quick validation** before committing Spanish text:

```bash
grep -rn 'pequeno\|tamano\|diseno\|espanol\|manana' src/content/methodology/es/ src/content/spec/es/ src/lib/translations/es.ts
grep -rn 'analisis\|numero\|codigo\|ejecucion\|version\|pagina\|titulo' src/content/methodology/es/ src/content/spec/es/ src/lib/translations/es.ts
```

If any match is found, fix it before committing. Full word lists in **[Standards Guide](docs/STANDARDS.md)**.

### 3. Import Order Convention (MANDATORY)

```typescript
// 1. Node.js native modules
import { dirname, resolve } from 'node:path';

// 2. Third-party packages
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
import { z } from 'astro:content';

// 3. Internal project modules (using @ alias)
import Header from '@/components/layout/Header.svelte';
import { SITE_TITLE } from '@/lib/constances';
import { getTranslations } from '@/lib/translations';

// 4. Type imports (separate group)
import type { APIRoute } from 'astro';
import type { CollectionEntry } from 'astro:content';
```

### 4. Type Hints (RECOMMENDED)

Prefer explicit types on function signatures. Biome allows `any` for flexibility but explicit types are better. See **[Standards Guide](docs/STANDARDS.md)** for examples.

### 5. Code Quality (MANDATORY)

```bash
pnpm run biome:check        # Check linting and formatting
pnpm run biome:fix          # Auto-fix issues
pnpm run biome:fix:unsafe   # Fix with unsafe transformations
```

**DO NOT use ESLint or Prettier** — this project uses Biome exclusively.

### 6. Testing

```bash
pnpm run test               # Run all tests (single run)
pnpm run test:watch         # Watch mode
pnpm run test:coverage      # With coverage report
```

Tests use `*.test.ts` naming in `tests/unit/`. Coverage target: 80%+ on `src/lib/`. See **[Testing Guide](docs/TESTING_GUIDE.md)**.

### 7. Multilingual Content Synchronization (MANDATORY)

**ALL content changes MUST be synchronized across every active language.** The site ships 17 languages today (en, es, pt, zh, ja, de, fr, ko, ru, it, tr, id, vi, hi, pl, uk, th). The list of active languages is **derived** from `src/lib/translations/*.ts` — dropping a new `<code>.ts` file under `src/lib/translations/` auto-registers it through `getActiveLanguages()` in `src/lib/i18n.ts`. No exceptions.

**Content type rules:**

- **Pages:** Create 1 shared `*Page.astro` in `src/components/pages/` + a 3-line wrapper in `src/pages/<name>.astro` (default-lang, passes `lang="en"`) + a single dynamic wrapper in `src/pages/[lang]/<name>.astro` that derives `lang` from `Astro.params`. One dynamic file covers all 16 non-default languages — never duplicate per-language wrappers.
- **Methodology / Spec / Kit:** Every document MUST exist in every active language folder of its collection (`{en,es,pt,zh,…}/`), sharing the same English slug. Translate `title`, `description`, and body; preserve `order`, `lang`, and code blocks. Use the `/translate-sync` skill.
- **Translation Strings:** Add to EVERY locale file under `src/lib/translations/` (en.ts, es.ts, pt.ts, zh.ts, …). Update `types.ts` with any new interface keys. Run `pnpm run i18n:check` to verify parity.
- **Components:** Use `getTranslations(lang)` from `@/lib/translations`. Never hardcode user-visible strings.
- **Agent-Friendly Markdown (MANDATORY):** When page or translation content changes, update the corresponding `src/content/pages/{en,es,pt,zh,…}/*.md` files in every active language. These serve as Markdown endpoints for AI agents and MUST stay in sync with the HTML content. See **[Markdown for Agents](docs/aeo/MARKDOWN_FOR_AGENTS.md)**.

**Compliance checklist:**

- [ ] One `src/pages/<name>.astro` (default-lang) + one `src/pages/[lang]/<name>.astro` (all non-default)
- [ ] Methodology/spec/kit doc exists in every active language folder with the same English slug
- [ ] UI strings exist in every `src/lib/translations/*.ts` file (`pnpm run i18n:check` passes)
- [ ] No hardcoded user-visible text
- [ ] Page Markdown files updated in every `src/content/pages/<lang>/` (`pnpm run md:check` passes)

**Tools:** `/translate-sync` skill, `i18n-guardian` agent, `pnpm run i18n:scaffold <code>` for new languages. Adding a new language: see **[I18N Guide](docs/I18N_GUIDE.md)**.

### 8. Performance-First Mindset (MANDATORY)

1. **Prefer static over dynamic** — use `.astro` for non-interactive content
2. **Choose the laziest hydration** — `client:visible` or `client:idle` over `client:load`
3. **Minimize JavaScript** — prefer CSS-only solutions over JS
4. **Use native browser APIs** — IntersectionObserver over scroll listeners, native `loading="lazy"`
5. **Optimize images** — always include dimensions, lazy load below-fold content
6. **Avoid layout shifts** — reserve space for async content, `font-display: swap`
7. **Keep search payload lean** — use language-sharded endpoints, minimal index schema
8. **Protect Lighthouse scores** — run `pnpm run lighthouse` (mobile) and `pnpm run lighthouse:desktop` after performance-sensitive changes

See **[Performance Guide](docs/PERFORMANCE.md)**.

### 9. Accessibility Standards (MANDATORY)

1. **WCAG AA contrast** — 4.5:1 normal text, 3:1 large text
2. **Approved text colors** — `text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300` for secondary text. **NEVER** `text-gray-400`, `text-gray-500`, `dark:text-gray-400`, `dark:text-gray-500`
3. **Image dimensions** — every `<img>` must have `width` and `height`
4. **Semantic HTML** — proper heading hierarchy, landmarks, button vs link
5. **Text alternatives** — meaningful `alt` for informative images, `alt=""` for decorative
6. **Keyboard navigation** — all interactive elements focusable and operable
7. **ARIA** — disclosure pattern for nav dropdowns (not `role="menu"`)

See **[Accessibility Guide](docs/ACCESSIBILITY.md)**.

### 10. Analytics Verification Policy (MANDATORY)

1. Do not add or reintroduce `PUBLIC_GOOGLE_SITE_VERIFICATION`
2. Do not add `google-site-verification` meta tags in templates/components
3. Keep Bing verification as optional env-based meta tag (`PUBLIC_BING_SITE_VERIFICATION`)
4. GSC verification is DNS-only (Domain property DNS TXT)

## Shared Agent Coordination

Multiple AI agents collaborate on this codebase. When updating agent guidance, mirror changes across all relevant files. See **[AI Agent Collaboration](docs/AI_AGENT_COLLAB.md)**.

### Optional — Dailybot reporting (best-effort, never blocks)

This repo has the DWP **Dailybot addon** wired: the `dailybot` skill is installed alongside `deepworkplan` under `.agents/skills/` (vendored, tracked in git). When the Dailybot CLI is present and authenticated, DWP work emits standup-style agent updates at four lifecycle points — **kickoff** (a plan is approved: what is being built), **significant task** (a feature/fix ships mid-plan), **blocked** (a run halts; `state.json.blocked` says what it needs), and **completion** (the only **milestone**: what was built) — routed through the dailybot `report` sub-skill, with `--json-data` derived from the plan's `state.json`. If Dailybot is absent, unauthenticated, or unreachable — or `.dailybot/disabled` exists — skip silently and continue: **reporting never blocks any work.** Describe outcomes for the team, never plan IDs, task numbers, file paths, or git stats.

**Deterministic hook enforcement (Claude Code):** `.agents/settings.json` wires the Dailybot lifecycle hooks (`dailybot hook session-start | activity | stop`, CLI >= 1.12.0) so the harness itself detects unreported work and reminds the agent at end of turn — no reliance on the model remembering. When a reminder fires: send a report if a meaningful unit of work is done, or run `dailybot hook dismiss` if not — never ignore it silently, and never let reporting block work. The hooks are local-only, always exit 0, and respect `.dailybot/disabled`.

### Vendored agent skills — addons auto-refresh; deepworkplan is repo-adapted

`.agents/skills/deepworkplan/`, `.agents/skills/dailybot/`, and `.agents/skills/ai-diff-reviewer/` are **vendored copies** tracked in git and pinned via `skills-lock.json`. They are managed differently on purpose:

| Skill | Upstream | Release auto-refresh | Why |
|-------|----------|----------------------|-----|
| `deepworkplan` | `DailybotHQ/deepworkplan-skill` | **No** | Repo-adapted DWP kit — blind reinstall would overwrite local adaptation. Update only via an explicit, reviewed change that re-adapts the skill to this repository. |
| `dailybot` | `DailybotHQ/agent-skill` | **Yes** | Addon — safe to pin to latest upstream on every website release. |
| `ai-diff-reviewer` | `DailybotHQ/ai-diff-reviewer` | **Yes** | Addon — safe to pin to latest upstream on every website release. |

**How addon refresh works.** [`release_and_publish.yml`](.github/workflows/release_and_publish.yml) (which fires on every merge to `main`) has a dogfood step (Step 1a) that runs **before** the version bump and refreshes **only** `dailybot` and `ai-diff-reviewer`:

1. Resolves the latest tag of each auto-refreshed upstream skill via `gh release view --repo <owner/repo>`.
2. Compares against the vendored `SKILL.md` `version:` field. Only installs skills that actually moved.
3. Runs `npx --yes skills add <repo>@<tag> --skill <name> --force -y` — the exact command any downstream consumer would run, so this doubles as a live smoke test. Both `--yes` (npm's proceed prompt) AND `-y` (the skills CLI's agent-picker prompt) are required in a non-TTY runner — dropping either hangs the workflow indefinitely.
4. Asserts the invariant: installed `SKILL.md` version equals the requested tag. Refuses to proceed with the release if not.
5. If any files changed, commits `chore: dogfood vendored skills to (…)` locally with a selective subject that names ONLY the skills that moved (e.g., `chore: dogfood vendored skills to dailybot v3.10.3, ai-diff-reviewer v2.0.0`). Step 3's `git push --follow-tags` sends this commit alongside the version-bump commit and the tag in a single atomic push, and the dogfood commit appears in the auto-generated GitHub Release notes.

**Semantics.** Addon skill refresh is **release-driven**, not autonomous — no scheduled/cron refresh runs in the background. The auto-refreshed vendored copies advance only when a maintainer merges a PR to `main`, which is the same moment `release_and_publish.yml` cuts a new website release.

**Failure semantics.**
- `npx skills add` failure OR version-invariant mismatch → **fails the release** (a broken upstream tag must never quietly ship inside a website version).
- Transient `gh release view` blip (rate limit, temporary outage) → skips only that skill for this release; the release itself proceeds.
- Both auto-refreshed addon skills already at latest → clean no-op, no dogfood commit, release proceeds normally.

**Editing policy.**
- **Do not** hand-edit `.agents/skills/dailybot/` or `.agents/skills/ai-diff-reviewer/` — the next release will overwrite those edits. Contribute upstream, then merge any PR to trigger a website release that picks up the new upstream tag.
- **Do** treat `.agents/skills/deepworkplan/` as repo-adapted: changes there must be intentional and reviewed. Prefer contributing reusable improvements upstream in `DailybotHQ/deepworkplan-skill`, then re-adapting this copy deliberately — never rely on the release dogfood step to pull it in.

### PR review workflow — Cursor-based, `ready`-label gated (Action `@v2`)

The website ships an AI code-review workflow at [`.github/workflows/pr-review.yml`](.github/workflows/pr-review.yml) powered by [`DailybotHQ/ai-diff-reviewer@v2`](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/ai-diff-reviewer) (GitHub Marketplace listing: **"AI Diff Reviewer"**, skill + Action **v2**). It runs on every `pull_request` to `main` that carries the `ready` label AND is opened by a write-tier author (OWNER / MEMBER / COLLABORATOR), single Cursor provider (`model: auto`), and applies the `pr-reviewed` label on success. `critical` findings block the merge; `warning` and `info` findings are reported but non-blocking. CI runs Iteration-Aware Review (IAR) by default; local skill reviews remain a full pass.

**Labels.**

| Label | Role |
|-------|------|
| `ready` | Trigger / unlock the review (toggle off→on to re-run) |
| `pr-reviewed` | Applied automatically after a successful, non-skipped review |
| `skip-ai-review` | Opt-in emergency bypass — short-circuits the LLM with a successful check + ⏭️ skipped tracking comment. Protect with a ruleset if the AI review is a merge gate. Distinct from `full-review-please` (IAR escape) |

**How to use it.**

1. Open a PR against `main` as normal.
2. Apply the `ready` label. The workflow triggers.
3. If the review passes, `pr-reviewed` is applied automatically and the `AI review gate` check turns green.
4. If a `critical` finding is posted, address it (edit, push a fix, or add an inline reply if you disagree), then toggle the `ready` label off and on to re-run.
5. Hotfix / mechanical revert only: apply `skip-ai-review` while `ready` is present (or apply both, then toggle `ready`) to bypass the LLM.

**Branch-protection integration.** Mark ONLY the stable-named `AI review gate` job as a required status check in Settings > Branches > Protection rules. GitHub treats `skipped` required checks as passing, so a PR without `ready` becomes mergeable without a review — pair this with a separate rule that enforces `ready` on every PR if that's the workflow you want.

**Setup: `CURSOR_API_KEY` secret.**

1. Get a Cursor subscription key from Cursor's dashboard (unlimited reviews on Pro).
2. Repo Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions > **New repository secret**.
3. Name: exactly `CURSOR_API_KEY`. Value: the key. Save.
4. Without the secret, the `AI review gate` job fails loud with an actionable message ("CURSOR_API_KEY is not configured on this repo").

**Local ↔ CI ↔ apply-review three-moment loop.** The same [`ai-diff-reviewer`](https://skills.sh/DailybotHQ/ai-diff-reviewer) skill vendored at `.agents/skills/ai-diff-reviewer/` powers both the local pre-push review and the CI pass — the skill's `prompt.md` is byte-identical to the CI Action's shipped `prompts/default.md` at the same tag (enforced by upstream CI). Three moments in a maintainer's day:

1. **Local pre-push review** (optional) — run the `ai-diff-reviewer` skill's parent default flow (`/ai-diff-reviewer` or "Review my current branch") before pushing. Shares the same methodology and severity model as CI (byte-identical `prompt.md` + this extension); under v2 Iteration-Aware Review, CI round 2+ may be shorter while the local pass stays full.
2. **CI review** — push, apply `ready`, this workflow runs.
3. **Post-CI walkthrough** (optional) — invoke the skill's `apply-review` sub-skill to walk through the CI-posted findings per-finding (apply / defer / skip) with explicit consent. Read-only by default; edits require per-finding yes; never commits or pushes.

**Shared override file: [`.review/extension.md`](.review/extension.md).** Repo-tailored severity overrides + "don't comment on" scopes + repo-specific context. The local skill and the CI Action read the SAME file via `prompt-extension-file:` — one source of truth for what maps to `critical` vs `warning` vs `info` in this codebase.

## Architecture Patterns

> Full patterns with code examples: **[Architecture Guide](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)**

### 1. Astro Components

`.astro` files are the foundation. Script block (frontmatter) runs at build time. Use for all non-interactive content. Svelte is only for interactive components.

```astro
---
interface Props {
  title: string;
  count?: number;
}
const { title, count = 5 } = Astro.props;
---

<section class="py-12">
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100">{title}</h2>
</section>
```

### 2. Content Collections

Methodology, spec, kit, and pages content use Astro Content Collections with Zod schemas defined in `src/content.config.ts`.

### 3. Svelte Integration

Use Svelte for interactive components. Always include a `client:*` directive (`client:visible` preferred over `client:load`).

### 4. Page Wrapper Pattern (MANDATORY)

Pages in `src/pages/` are ultra-minimal routing wrappers. All logic lives in `*Page.astro` components in `src/components/pages/`. Adding a new page is exactly **two** wrappers regardless of how many languages ship: one default-language file at the root and one dynamic `[lang]` file that covers all 16 (or N) non-default languages.

**Key rules:**

- Page components handle `MainLayout` internally — wrappers **never** import `MainLayout`
- The default-language wrapper passes `lang="en"` as a string literal; the dynamic wrapper derives `lang` from `Astro.params`
- For a new page: create **1 `*Page.astro` component** + **1 default-lang wrapper** + **1 `[lang]` dynamic wrapper** (regardless of how many languages exist)
- All user-visible text uses `getTranslations(lang)`, all URLs use `getUrlPrefix(lang)`
- Add the new page's slug to `KNOWN_BASE_PATHS` in `src/middleware.ts` — one entry covers every language

**Page component** (`src/components/pages/AboutPage.astro`):

```astro
---
import MainLayout from '@/layouts/MainLayout.astro';
import { getTranslations } from '@/lib/translations';
import { getUrlPrefix, type Language } from '@/lib/i18n';

interface Props { lang: Language; }
const { lang } = Astro.props;
const t = getTranslations(lang);
const prefix = getUrlPrefix(lang);
---

<MainLayout lang={lang} title={t.aboutPage.title} description={t.aboutPage.description}>
  <!-- page content using t.* for text, prefix for URLs -->
</MainLayout>
```

**Default-lang wrapper** (`src/pages/about.astro` — 3 lines):

```astro
---
import AboutPage from '@/components/pages/AboutPage.astro';
---
<AboutPage lang="en" />
```

**Dynamic `[lang]` wrapper** (`src/pages/[lang]/about.astro` — covers all non-default languages):

```astro
---
import AboutPage from '@/components/pages/AboutPage.astro';
import { getActiveNonDefaultLanguages, type Language } from '@/lib/i18n';

export function getStaticPaths() {
  return getActiveNonDefaultLanguages().map((lang) => ({ params: { lang } }));
}

const { lang } = Astro.params as { lang: Language };
---
<AboutPage lang={lang} />
```

### 5. i18n Routing

The default language (English) is served from `src/pages/` at the root. Every non-default active language is served from the single dynamic `src/pages/[lang]/**` tree — `getStaticPaths()` enumerates the registry via `getActiveNonDefaultLanguages()`, so adding a new language requires zero edits in `src/pages/`. Page components in `src/components/pages/` receive `lang` and handle translations internally.

### 6. Internal Hub (Dev-Only)

Dev-only portal at `/internal/`. Uses `InternalLayout` or `ShowcaseLayout` (never `MainLayout`). English-only, no Page Wrapper pattern. Automatically excluded from production builds via three layers (post-build deletion, sitemap filter, noindex meta).

## Methodology Content Conventions

Methodology documentation is the **primary content** of the site. It lives in multilingual content collections (17 active languages) and is rendered by the methodology, spec, and kit readers.

**Collections:**

- **`methodology/{en,es,pt,zh,…}/`** — The narrative methodology docs (what DWP is, how to adopt it, principles, workflow). Primary marketing-and-teaching content.
- **`spec/{en,es,pt,zh,…}/`** — The readable specification (the normative DWP standard: task anatomy, validation gates, completion protocol, mandatory final tasks, archetypes, addons).
- **`kit/{en,es,pt,zh,…}/`** — The kit catalog: presets, adapters, and commands available for installing DWP into a repo.

**File naming:** `slug.md` (or `.mdx`) in the relevant `<lang>/` directory. **Slugs MUST be in English** in every language; all language versions share the same English slug.

**Multilingual parity:** Every methodology/spec/kit document MUST exist in every active language folder. Non-English content MUST carry correct diacritics, scripts, and punctuation for its language (Spanish `ñ`/tildes/`¿`/`¡`; CJK full-width punctuation; etc.). Use the `/translate-sync` skill and `i18n-guardian` agent.

**Voice:** Serious, neutral, technical. No hype, no exclamation marks in body copy, sentence-case headings. This is a specification-and-methodology site.

**Agent-friendly Markdown:** Every rendered HTML page MUST have a matching `src/content/pages/{en,es}/*.md` endpoint kept in sync (`pnpm run md:check`). See [Markdown for Agents](docs/aeo/MARKDOWN_FOR_AGENTS.md).

## Documentation Standards

Update docs after: adding components/pages, changing schemas, updating config, adding npm scripts, establishing patterns. See **[Documentation Guide](docs/DOCUMENTATION_GUIDE.md)**.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### DON'T:

1. Put interactive logic in `.astro` files (use Svelte)
2. Skip `client:*` directive for interactive Svelte components
3. Import `MainLayout` in page wrappers (it belongs inside `*Page.astro`)
4. Hardcode translatable text in templates
5. Create content without covering all active languages
6. Use `client:load` when `client:visible` or `client:idle` would suffice
7. Add JS solutions when CSS can achieve the same result
8. Use `text-gray-400`, `dark:text-gray-400`, or `dark:text-gray-500` for body text (fails WCAG AA)
9. Use `role="menu"` for nav dropdowns (use disclosure pattern)
10. Skip heading levels (e.g., h1 -> h3 without h2)
11. Forget `alt=""` on decorative images or `aria-label` on icon-only links
12. Use `MainLayout` for internal hub pages (use `InternalLayout` or `ShowcaseLayout`)
13. Add multilingual variants for internal pages (English-only, dev-only)
14. Reference `/internal/` pages from public pages
15. Write non-English content without proper diacritics/punctuation for its language (Spanish ñ/tildes/¿/¡; CJK full-width punctuation; etc.)
16. **Leave placeholder content in published content** — `[AUTHOR: ...]`, `[TODO: ...]`, `[TBD]`, or any bracketed "fill in later" text. Published pages must be complete. Zero tolerance.
17. **Use non-English slugs for content collections** — all slugs (methodology/spec/kit filenames) MUST be in English, even for non-English content
18. **Re-introduce removed surfaces** — the blog engine, slides/tech-talks, and the personal pages (cv, portfolio, dailybot, foodie, hobbies, trading, entrepreneur) have been removed from this site. Do not add them back or reference them.
19. **Add a new top-level page without updating `src/middleware.ts`** — the middleware allowlist is derived from one set: `KNOWN_BASE_PATHS` (per-language page slugs). Adding `'foo'` to that set covers every language — `/foo`, `/es/foo`, `/pt/foo`, `/zh/foo`, etc. — at once; the prefixed-language list comes from the registry (`getActiveNonDefaultLanguages()`), so new languages need no edit. New top-level routes return 404 until their slug is added. Symptom: dev log shows `[404] (rewrite) /foo` (the `(rewrite)` is the smoking gun — it comes from `context.rewrite()` in the middleware, not from Astro routing). Multi-segment paths like `/foo/bar` and any path containing `.` bypass the rule. The canonical adoption endpoint `/init` (plus its `/setup` and `/onboarding` redirects) is already in `KNOWN_BASE_PATHS`; keep it there. See [Architecture → Middleware Allowlist](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#middleware-allowlist-critical).

### DO:

1. Use Biome for linting (`pnpm run biome:check` before commits)
2. Use Svelte for interactive components with appropriate `client:*` directive
3. Support dark mode with Tailwind's `dark:` variant
4. Use `@` path alias for imports
5. Use the Page wrapper pattern (thin wrappers + `*Page.astro`)
6. Create/update content in all active languages
7. Use `text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300` for secondary text (WCAG AA)
8. Include `width` and `height` on all `<img>` elements
9. Verify non-English diacritics/scripts before committing (`pnpm run i18n:check`)
10. Ensure no placeholder content in published pages (`grep -rn '\[AUTHOR:\|\[AUTOR:\|\[TODO:\|\[TBD\]\|\[FIXME\]' src/content/` → zero matches)
11. Add a version for every active language for all methodology, spec, and kit content
12. Keep matching `src/content/pages/<lang>/*.md` endpoints in sync with every rendered page (`pnpm run md:check`)

### Execution Modes

| Mode | Support | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| Sequential | All agents | Default — tasks one at a time |
| Subagents | Claude Code | Helper agents within session |
| Team Agents | Claude Code only | Parallel instances with shared coordination |
| Orchestrator | All agents | Child DWPs in sub-repos |

See [Team Agents Reference](docs/technical/TEAM_AGENTS_REFERENCE.md) for details.

## ⚡ Slash Commands (All Agents)

**This section applies to ALL agents** — Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, Cursor AI, Gemini, and any other assistant.

### How to Invoke Commands

| Agent | Prefix | Example |
|-------|--------|---------|
| **Claude Code** | `/` (native) | `/translate-sync` |
| **OpenAI Codex** | `#` | `#translate-sync` |
| **Cursor AI** | `#` | `#translate-sync` |
| **Gemini / others** | `#` | `#translate-sync` |

> **Why `#` for non-Claude agents?** Most AI CLIs (Codex, Cursor) intercept `/` as their own system commands. Using `#` avoids interception. You can also write the command name in plain text: "run translate-sync".

When a command is invoked (via `/`, `#`, or by name), the agent MUST:

1. **Look up** the command in **[Commands Reference](.agents/docs/COMMANDS_REFERENCE.md)** to find its procedure file
2. **READ** the linked procedure file completely
3. **FOLLOW** its step-by-step instructions exactly
4. **DO NOT** improvise or skip steps — the procedure file IS the spec

> **If a user prompt starts with `#`** (e.g., `#translate-sync`, `#quick-fix`), treat it as a command invocation — look up the command name (without `#`) in the [Commands Reference](.agents/docs/COMMANDS_REFERENCE.md) and execute its procedure.

## Conventional Commits

**Format:** `<type>: <description>`

**Types:** `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, `perf`, `ci`

Examples: `feat: add kit catalog filtering`, `fix: resolve dark mode toggle on mobile`
