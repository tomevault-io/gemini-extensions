# Power Platform MCP Server — Claude Code Instructions

## The 6-Phase Flow Workflow

**ALWAYS follow this workflow when users want to create, build, or modify a Power Automate flow:**

### Phase 1: PLAN
1. Call `plan_flow` with the user's description
2. Present ALL clarifying questions to the user (don't skip any)
3. Wait for answers before proceeding
4. If answers are incomplete, ask follow-up questions

### Phase 2: REVIEW
1. Show the user what will be built:
   - Trigger type and timing
   - Actions in order
   - Required connections
2. Confirm before creating
3. Warn about Premium connectors if detected

### Phase 3: VALIDATE
1. For complex flows, use `validate_flow` on the definition
2. Warn about missing error handling
3. Suggest best practices if violations detected

### Phase 4: CREATE
1. Create the flow with `create_flow` or `build_flow`
2. Note the flow ID for testing
3. Remind user the flow is created but stopped by default

### Phase 5: TEST
1. **ALWAYS test after creating or modifying a flow**
2. Use `test_flow` for guided testing with diagnostics
3. Or use `run_flow` for quick execution
4. Check results immediately

### Phase 6: DEBUG (if needed)
1. If test fails, call `diagnose_flow` immediately
2. Show user the error category and suggested fix
3. Offer to apply the fix
4. Re-test after fixing
5. Repeat until flow succeeds

## Canvas App Source Workflow (Preview)

When asked to create or modify a Canvas app, use an existing blank/editable app shell and follow this sequence:

1. Call `connect_canvas_authoring` with the Power Apps Studio Designer URL. Do not guess account, tenant, or authentication overrides.
2. Call `sync_canvas_source` into a dedicated absolute directory and inspect all returned `.pa.yaml` files. The Studio tab must remain open with coauthoring enabled.
3. Before adding controls, call `list_canvas_controls`, then `describe_canvas_control` for every control type used. Likewise discover APIs and data-source schemas instead of guessing them.
4. Write `App.pa.yaml` plus one `.pa.yaml` file per screen. Use `expectedSha256` for every overwrite or delete so concurrent edits cannot be lost silently.
5. Call `compile_canvas_source` with `confirm=true`, fix every reported file/line error, and repeat until clean. Compilation changes the live Studio draft.
6. Re-sync or verify in Studio, then ask the maker to test, save, and publish. A clean compile does not prove runtime behavior, layout, accessibility, data authentication, save, or publish.

<details>
<summary><strong>Setup & Authentication</strong> (1 tools)</summary>

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `sign_in` | Sign in to Microsoft Power Platform when other tools report missing credentials. Starts Microsoft's device-code sign-in and returns a code plus a microsoft.com link for the user to complete in their own browser (MFA included) — no terminal needed. Call sign_in again after the user says they've finished to confirm. This tool only displays the code; it never asks for or accepts passwords. |

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Core Flow Operations</strong> (15 tools)</summary>

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `list_flows` | List Power Automate flows in an environment. Returns flow names, IDs, state (Started/Stopped), last modified dates, and owners. Use scope='shared' to find flows shared with you, scope='owned' for your flows only. Use this to discover what flows exist before getting details or making changes. |
| `get_flow` | Get the complete definition of a Power Automate flow including triggers, actions, connection references, and description. Use list_flows first to find flow IDs. Set format='json' or format='both' to capture the FULL definition including nested actions inside Switch/If/Foreach/Scope (the default 'summary' format only shows top-level actions). |
| `create_flow` | Create a new Power Automate flow. Provide a trigger, actions, and connection references. Use search_connectors and get_action_schema to understand the required parameters for connector actions. The flow is created enabled (Started); use toggle_flow to stop it. |
| `update_flow` | Update an existing Power Automate flow. Three update modes: (1) full replace — pass 'actions' to replace all top-level actions (default; you must include nested actions you want kept), (2) merge — set mergeActions=true to deep-merge only the actions you provide, leaving the rest intact, (3) patch — use patchActions with path keys (e.g. 'If/cases/Default/actions/Compose') for surgical edits with the smallest payload. Use get_flow with format='json' first to see the full nested action tree. |
| `preview_update` | Preview exactly what update_flow would change on a flow — display name, trigger, added/removed/modified actions, and connection references — without writing anything. Run this before update_flow on flows that matter. |
| `delete_flow` | Delete a Power Automate flow permanently. This action cannot be undone. You must set confirm=true to proceed with deletion. Use get_flow first to verify you have the correct flow. |
| `toggle_flow` | Enable or disable a Power Automate flow. Use 'start' to enable a stopped flow or 'stop' to disable a running flow. The flow must exist and you must have permission to modify it. |
| `clone_flow` | Clone an existing Power Automate flow to create a copy with a new name. Optionally update connection references in the clone. The cloned flow will be created in a stopped state. |
| `export_flow` | Export a flow as a package. Returns the flow definition and metadata that can be used to import into another environment or as a backup. |
| `share_flow` | Share a flow with users, groups, or service principals. Grant them either 'CanEdit' (can modify the flow) or 'CanView' (run-only access) permissions. You need the Microsoft Entra object ID of the principal to share with. |
| `get_flow_permissions` | Get the list of users, groups, and service principals that have access to a flow. Shows their role (Owner, CanEdit, CanView) and identity information. Use this to audit who can see or modify a flow. |
| `list_flow_versions` | List all versions of a flow. Each version represents a saved state of the flow definition. Use this to track changes or restore to a previous version. |
| `get_flow_version` | Read one saved version of a flow, including its full definition — inspect what a flow looked like before a change, or check a version before restoring it. |
| `restore_flow_version` | Roll a flow back to a previous saved version — the undo for a bad edit. Previews the change unless confirm=true. The current definition is itself saved as a version first, so a restore can be undone. |
| `get_trigger_inputs` | Get the trigger payload a past run actually fired with — the real inputs, not a hand-written guess. Feed it back through test_flow to reproduce a failure against the data that caused it. |

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Testing & Debugging</strong> (10 tools)</summary>

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `test_flow` | Test a Power Automate flow with guided feedback. This tool: 1. Gets the flow's expected input schema (if any) 2. Runs the flow with provided test data 3. Waits for completion 4. Reports success or provides diagnosis for failures Use this after creating or modifying a flow to verify it works correctly. |
| `run_flow` | Trigger a Power Automate flow to run immediately. Works with any trigger type (manual, scheduled, event-based). Optionally pass input data and wait for the run to complete. |
| `get_runs` | Get the execution history of a Power Automate flow. Shows run times, status (Succeeded/Failed/Running), and error information for failed runs. Useful for debugging flow issues. |
| `get_run_actions` | Get detailed action-level information for a flow run. Shows each action's status, timing, inputs/outputs, and error details. Use 'failedOnly: true' to focus on failures, 'actionName' to drill into a specific action, 'includeInputs'/'includeOutputs' to see full data payloads. |
| `get_run_action_repetitions` | Get iteration-level details for a for_each or do_until loop action in a flow run. Shows which iterations succeeded/failed, their inputs/outputs, and error details. Essential for debugging loops that partially fail. |
| `diagnose_flow` | Diagnose issues with a Power Automate flow. Analyzes recent runs, identifies failures, and provides specific fixes. Use this when a flow fails or behaves unexpectedly. |
| `validate_flow` | Validate a Power Automate flow definition for errors. Can validate either an existing flow by ID or a new definition. Checks for schema errors, expression syntax, circular dependencies, and missing connection references. |
| `resubmit_run` | Resubmit a failed or cancelled flow run. This will re-execute the flow with the same trigger inputs. Only works for flows with manual triggers. |
| `cancel_run` | Cancel a currently running flow execution. Use this to stop a flow that is taking too long or running incorrectly. |
| `cancel_all_runs` | Cancel every in-flight run of a flow (Running, Waiting, Paused, Suspended). Without confirm=true it previews which runs would be cancelled. Cancelled runs cannot be resumed. |

<summary><strong>Planning & Help</strong> (5 tools)</summary>

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `plan_flow` | Interactive flow planning wizard. Call this FIRST when user wants to create or build a flow. IMPORTANT: This tool returns clarifying questions that you MUST present to the user before proceeding. Do NOT skip the questions or make assumptions. Workflow: 1. Call plan_flow with the user's description 2. Present ALL questions to the user (don't answer them yourself) 3. Collect user's answers 4. Call plan_flow again with answers to get the final plan 5. Use create_flow or build_flow with the resulting definition Questions cover: trigger timing, recipients, data sources, formatting preferences, etc. |
| `build_flow` | Build a Power Automate flow from a description. RECOMMENDED: Use plan_flow FIRST to gather requirements through the interactive wizard, then use this tool to create the flow. This tool: 1. Analyzes the goal 2. Detects required connections 3. Creates the flow directly Missing connections do NOT block creation: the flow is built anyway (stopped, so it can't fail-run), and the response lists exactly which connections still need to be configured at make.powerautomate.com. Connections that already exist are used automatically. For complex flows with multiple data sources, approvals, or specific timing requirements, use plan_flow first to clarify details. |
| `get_expression_help` | Get help with Power Automate expressions. Provides: - Common functions reference by category - Context-specific examples - Expression syntax validation - Best practices and tips Use when building flow actions that need expressions. |
| `search_connectors` | Search for Power Automate connectors by name, description, or category. Returns matching connectors with their tier (Standard/Premium) and capabilities. Use this to discover available connectors before building flows. |
| `get_action_schema` | Get the schema and parameters for a connector's actions/triggers. Use search_connectors first to find connector IDs. Without operationId, returns a list of all available operations. With operationId, returns detailed parameter and response schemas. |

| `ensure_connection` | Get a working connection for a connector in one call: returns an existing Connected one if there is any, otherwise creates one and hands back sign-in instructions. Use this instead of stitching list/create/test together — it is the right first step before binding a connector into a flow. |
| `create_connection` | Create a connection for a connector. OAuth connectors (SharePoint, Office 365, Teams…) are created unauthenticated and come back with sign-in instructions — a direct consent link where the environment offers one, otherwise a deep link to the connection in the maker portal — then test_connection confirms. API-key style connectors accept their values via parameters. |
| `test_connection` | Check whether a connection is healthy (Connected) and surface its error state when it isn't — use after create_connection consent, or when a flow fails with connection/auth errors. |
| `fix_connection` | Repair a broken or expired connection: returns re-authentication instructions — a fresh consent link where the environment offers one, otherwise a deep link to the connection in the maker portal. No-op with confirmation when the connection is already healthy. |
| `delete_connection` | Permanently delete a connection. Flows bound to it will fail until re-bound. Requires confirm=true. |
| `list_custom_connectors` | List all custom connectors in the environment. Shows connector names, IDs, and operation counts. |

<details>
<summary><strong>Dataverse Depth (queries, metadata, schema, bulk)</strong> (11 tools)</summary>

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `execute_fetchxml` | Run a FetchXML query against Dataverse — use this instead of query_dataverse_rows when you need aggregates (count, sum, avg, min, max), grouping, or joins across related tables (link-entity). Example: total opportunities by owner, cases grouped by status. Pass the entity set name and the full <fetch> XML. |
| `search_dataverse` | Full-text search across Dataverse tables (relevance search) — 'find anything mentioning Contoso'. Returns ranked matches with the table and record id for follow-up reads. Requires the environment's Dataverse search feature to be enabled (an ENV_LIMITATION error means it isn't). |
| `get_dataverse_option_set` | Get the labels and integer values of a choice (option set) column or a global option set. ALWAYS use this before writing to a choice column (statuscode, statecode, custom picklists) — the integer values cannot be guessed, and a wrong value writes bad data silently. Pass table+column for a column's choices, or globalName for a shared option set. |
| `get_dataverse_relationships` | List a table's relationships (1:N, N:1, N:N) with their schema names and navigation properties. Use before associate_dataverse_rows / disassociate_dataverse_rows or $expand queries — relationship names cannot be guessed. |
| `upsert_dataverse_row` | Create-or-update a Dataverse row addressed by alternate key(s) instead of a GUID — ideal for syncing external data (e.g., rows keyed by an account number). Reports whether the row was created or updated. |
| `assign_dataverse_row` | Change the owner of a Dataverse row to another user or team. Use list-type tools or search to find the new owner's id first. |
| `associate_dataverse_rows` | Link two existing Dataverse rows through a named relationship (N:N or 1:N) — e.g., add a contact to a marketing list. Get the relationship's navigation property name from get_dataverse_relationships first. |
| `disassociate_dataverse_rows` | Remove a relationship link between two Dataverse rows (the rows themselves are untouched). Set confirm=true to proceed. |
| `create_dataverse_column` | Create a new column on a Dataverse table. Supports string, memo, integer, decimal, money, datetime, boolean, and picklist (choice) types. The schema name must carry your solution publisher's prefix (e.g., 'new_ProjectCode'). Requires confirm=true. After creating, run publish_all_customizations for the column to appear in apps. |
| `create_dataverse_lookup_column` | Create a lookup (N:1 foreign-key) column on a table, pointing at another table — creates the column and the relationship together, which is the only way the Web API supports it. Requires confirm=true. |
| `batch_dataverse_operations` | Execute up to 100 Dataverse operations in one request — the right tool for bulk work like 'add every approved row from this spreadsheet'. Set atomic=true to make it all-or-nothing (any failure rolls back everything; GETs not allowed in atomic mode). Batches containing DELETE operations require confirm=true. |

| `update_sharepoint_item` | Update an existing SharePoint list item. Only include fields you want to change. |
| `delete_sharepoint_item` | Delete a SharePoint list item permanently. This action cannot be undone. You must set confirm=true to proceed. |
| `list_sharepoint_files` | List files in a SharePoint document library. Use list_sharepoint_lists first to find document libraries, then use list_sharepoint_lists with the site ID to get drive IDs via the library's driveType. |
| `upload_sharepoint_file` | Upload a file to a SharePoint document library. Simple upload supports files up to 4MB. Provide the file content as a base64-encoded string. |
| `get_sharepoint_file_content` | Download a file's content from a SharePoint document library. Returns base64-encoded content for text files under 1MB, metadata-only for larger or binary files. |

## Desktop flows (RPA) — operate, don't author

**There is no way to create or edit a desktop flow through this server, and no
API exists for it.** The definition is Robin script plus companion
`desktopflowbinary` records; Microsoft documents no write path and their own
disaster-recovery guidance is to paste the script into the Power Automate for
desktop designer manually. Never offer to build one.

What to do when a user asks to create one: say authoring happens in Power
Automate for desktop, then offer what this server does well — run an existing
flow, watch it, diagnose a failure, check machine health, or set up work
queues. Moving an authored flow between environments IS supported via
`export_solution` / `import_solution`.

Runs are asynchronous: `run_desktop_flow` returns a session id immediately;
poll `get_desktop_flow_run`. Attended runs need Premium on the connection
owner; unattended additionally need a Process license on the machine — the
tools name which one is missing.

## Critical Rules

1. **ALWAYS test after changes** - Never assume success
2. **NEVER create duplicates** - Use `update_flow` for existing flows
3. **ALWAYS diagnose failures** - Don't leave broken flows
4. **Present all questions** - Don't assume user's answers
5. **Verify connections first** - Check before building
6. **Use `update_flow` not `create_flow`** when modifying an existing flow
7. **Preview before you write** — `preview_update` shows exactly what an edit
   changes and writes nothing. Use it on any flow that matters.
8. **There is an undo** — `list_flow_versions` then `restore_flow_version`
   rolls back a bad edit, and the rollback is itself reversible.
9. **Reproduce with real data** — `get_trigger_inputs` returns the payload a
   failed run actually fired with. Do not invent test input when the real one
   is available.
10. **Never tell a user to re-run `--setup` for a consent error.** It cannot
    grant consent — an Entra admin must. Name the specific permission from the
    error instead.
11. **Confirm destructive operations by name and ID.** 39 tools are annotated
    destructive; `reset_environment`, `restore_environment`, and
    `copy_environment` are irreversible from here.

## Example Workflow

```
User: "Create a flow that emails me daily sales reports"

1. PLAN
   → Call plan_flow with "emails me daily sales reports"
   → Present questions: What time? What data? Which email?
   → Wait for answers

2. REVIEW
   → "I'll create a scheduled flow at 8 AM daily that sends an email with sales data"
   → Confirm: "Shall I proceed?"

3. CREATE
   → Call build_flow with complete specification
   → Output: Created "Daily Sales Report (Scheduled)" (abc123...)

4. TEST
   → Call test_flow flowId="abc123..."
   → Wait for completion
   → Show result: TEST PASSED or TEST FAILED

5. DEBUG (if needed)
   → If failed, diagnose_flow shows: "Connection Error - Re-authenticate"
   → Apply fix
   → test_flow again
   → Repeat until success
```

## Connection Requirements

Resolve connections BEFORE building — a missing connection is the most common
reason a build stalls halfway.

- **`ensure_connection`** is the one call to make: it returns an existing
  Connected connection, or creates one and hands back sign-in instructions.
  Use it instead of stitching `list_connections` + `create_connection` +
  `test_connection` together.
- The server is headless, so it cannot complete OAuth. It returns a consent
  link, or (on environments that expose none — `Default-` environments do not)
  a deep link to the connection in the maker portal. Say that plainly rather
  than implying sign-in already happened.
- **A flow that "just stopped working" is usually an expired connection.**
  Connections die after ~90 days of inactivity (`AADSTS700082`).
  `test_connection` shows it in one step; `fix_connection` returns the repair
  link.
- `create_connection`/`test_connection`/`fix_connection`/`delete_connection`
  need the Power Platform API connectivity scopes with admin consent.
  `list_connections` alone does not.

## Error Recovery Patterns

| Error Type | Suggested Fix |
|------------|---------------|
| Connection Error | Re-authenticate at Power Automate portal |
| Resource Not Found | Verify path/ID, check if deleted |
| Timeout | Enable async, increase timeout, batch operations |
| Rate Limited | Add delays, reduce concurrency |
| Expression Error | Use get_expression_help, check syntax |
| Permission Error | Check service account permissions |
| Consent Error | Admin must grant consent (Global Admin, App Admin, Cloud App Admin, or Privileged Role Admin) |

## Best Practices to Suggest

1. Add Try-Catch error handling for important flows
2. Use meaningful action names
3. Add Compose actions to debug complex expressions
4. Set appropriate timeouts on HTTP actions
5. Use trigger conditions to filter high-volume triggers


## Live-validation lessons (do not relearn these)

Doc-derived code against Microsoft APIs has a meaningful defect rate. Every
one of these passed the mock suite and failed against a real tenant:

- **Dataverse GUIDs are not RFC 4122.** Sequential GUIDs carry a version
  nibble outside 1–8 (real: `8ae8d5b3-6989-f111-…`). Use
  `GUID_PATTERN` from `utils/security.js`, never `z.string().uuid()`.
  Adjusting a test fixture to satisfy a validator is how this stayed hidden —
  question the validator first.
- **Never swallow an error and return a default.** `get_work_queue` reported
  "0 queued" for a full queue because a 400 was caught and turned into `0`.
  A confidently wrong number is worse than a failure.
- **`workqueueitems/$count?$filter=` is rejected** by Dataverse. Use the inline
  OData count (`$count=true` → `@odata.count`).
- **The per-environment Power Platform API host does not resolve** for
  `Default-` environments. Use the global `api.powerplatform.com`; the
  connectivity routes need the environment in the path AND a
  `$filter=environment eq '…'` query.
- **MSAL caches access tokens ~1h**, so a stale-token 403 looks identical to a
  missing-scope 403 right after granting consent. Force a refresh before
  concluding anything about permissions.
- **Smoke-test any new Dataverse family live before shipping it.** Work queues
  need only a signed-in account and clean up after themselves.
