# decky-romm-sync — Decky Loader Plugin

## What This Is

A Decky Loader plugin that syncs a self-hosted RomM library into Steam as Non-Steam shortcuts. Games launch via
RetroDECK. The QAM panel handles settings, sync, downloads, and BIOS management.

## What belongs in this file

Three things, and nothing else:

1. **Traps** — where an agent would confidently do the wrong thing and have no reason to go look first.
2. **Cross-cutting invariants** — rules that span files, so no single diff shows the whole rule.
3. **Workflow** — how we work here; not derivable from the code.

Everything else is topic depth: `docs/` for humans, `.claude/rules/` for path-scoped coding conventions. A rule with a
mechanical check needs only its one-line statement here (CI carries the enforcement); a rule without one needs its full
statement here or in the rule file that owns its area, because nothing else will catch it.

## Where the details live

Each page below is the current-truth owner of its area, and most carry their own ADR trail. Read the page before working
in the area. **Do not cite ADRs from this file** — an ADR is frozen history (and may be `Proposed` or superseded, which
is invisible at the citation site), so reach it through the page that owns the topic.

- Domain vocabulary — the canonical meaning of project terms — [CONTEXT.md](CONTEXT.md). A glossary, not a spec: use its
  wording in code, issues, and PRs, and add a term there the moment it resolves in discussion.
- Steam shortcuts — appIds, artwork, launch-option writes, removal churn —
  [steam-non-steam-shortcuts.md](docs/architecture/steam-non-steam-shortcuts.md)
- Save-file sync — slots, conflict resolution, negotiate transport, version history —
  [save-file-sync-architecture.md](docs/architecture/save-file-sync-architecture.md)
- Save-sync coverage matrix — [save-sync-coverage.md](docs/architecture/save-sync-coverage.md)
- Removed-game cleanup — deletion authority, admission/leases, claims, recovery bundles —
  [removed-game-cleanup.md](docs/architecture/removed-game-cleanup.md)
- Services, adapters, wiring; connection/token and settings-persistence internals —

  `docs/user-guide/`
- Dev setup, dependency management, frontend loop — `docs/contributing/`

## Path-scoped rules — `.claude/rules/`

Coding conventions live in `.claude/rules/*.md`, each carrying a `paths:` frontmatter glob. They are plain Markdown, not
a harness-specific format: an agent that supports path-scoped rules gets one loaded when a matching file is read, and
**every other agent must open the file itself**. Either way it arrives a beat late for code you are **creating** rather
than editing, so the entries below lead with what goes wrong unnoticed. Read the rule that owns an area before writing
new code in it.

- `services.md` — a new service takes **one `config: XxxServiceConfig` kwarg** (frozen, all deps inside); debug logging
  is the injected `DebugLogger`. Neither is checked.
- `python-conventions.md` — Protocol suffixes by shape, `do_<verb>` vs. `_<verb>_io`, docstrings stating the contract
  rather than the behavior, and when a subfolder is justified. **No mechanical check exists for any of it.**
- `adapters-domain.md` — adapters own I/O, domain is pure, aggregate mutations are verb-named after the event
  (`adopt_baseline`, not `update_baseline`). The field-assignment ban is checked; the naming is not.
- `romm-http.md` — an unproven 404 must never become `RommNotFoundError`, which is deletion authority downstream: the
  entity proof is the default and only the three byte-stream fetches opt out. Tests pin both directions; nothing else
  does.
- `bootstrap-wiring.md` — the `main.py` / `bootstrap/` split, and which half of `bootstrap/` new wiring belongs in.
- `callables.md` — the `{success, reason, message}` failure shape and its two carve-outs. Checked.
- `vendored-assets.md` — `_vendor/`, `native/`, `defaults/` are checksum-pinned verbatim copies. The checksums are
  checked; the reflex to fix the upstream artifact instead of the copy is not.
- `testing-backend.md` — test tiers, gate tests, vendored conformance vectors.
- `testing-frontend.md` — the `@decky/api` event harness, non-vacuous catch assertions.
- `comments.md` — an inline comment is the exception: only an outside-world fact, a road not taken, or a constraint the
  code cannot express. Re-read the comment on the line you touch — a stale one is worse than none, because it is
  believed and nothing in the toolchain contradicts it. **No mechanical check exists.**

## Documentation

**Docs are updated in the same PR as the code change. This is not optional.** When a change affects architecture, data
flows, feature behavior, or user-facing UI, the relevant page under `docs/` must be updated in the same PR.
Documentation-debt-as-a-separate-follow-up-issue is forbidden — those follow-ups never land. If you're not sure whether
a change needs docs, the default is "yes, it does." Enforced in CI by `.github/workflows/docs-check.yml`.

For genuinely doc-irrelevant PRs (pure refactor with no user-visible change, no architecture shift, no new flow;
tooling/CI changes; dependency bumps), set the `no-docs-change` label on the PR OR include `docs: N/A` (with a one-line
reason) in the PR description. Opting out is an explicit acknowledgement, not a silent omission.

Docs are Material for MkDocs, published to GitHub Pages by `.github/workflows/docs.yml` on push to `main`. Preview
locally with `mise run docs`.

## Traps — non-obvious rules that bite silently

- **Shortcuts**: Use `SteamClient.Apps.AddShortcut()` from frontend JS, NOT VDF writes. VDF edits require Steam restart;
  SteamClient API is instant.
- **AddShortcut ignores most params**: `AddShortcut(name, exe, startDir, launchOptions)` ignores startDir and
  launchOptions. Must use `Set*` calls (`SetShortcutName`, `SetShortcutExe`, `SetShortcutStartDir`,
  `SetAppLaunchOptions`) once the new app's overview is registered. Do NOT pass quoted exe paths — the API quotes
  internally.
- **AddShortcut timing**: After `AddShortcut()`, wait for the new app's overview before setting properties — poll
  `appStore.GetAppOverviewByAppID(appId)` (`waitForAppOverview`), never a blind fixed delay. Use 50ms between operations
  in the apply loop.
- **Shortcut appId is assigned, not derived**: Steam assigns it at creation and it is stable for the shortcut's
  lifetime; the plugin records it in `roms.shortcut_app_id` and detects ownership by the exe path. Never re-derive it
  (the `CRC32(exe + appName)` formula is disproven). `launchOptions`/`startDir` changes are appId-safe; **exe/name**
  changes require delete + recreate.
- **Frontend API**: `@decky/ui` + `@decky/api` (NOT deprecated `decky-frontend-lib`). Use `callable()` (NOT
  `ServerAPI.callPluginMethod()`).
- **Decky callables must be async**: Even if the body is synchronous, Decky's callable framework requires `async def`.
  Do not remove `async` from callable methods in `main.py`.
- **RomM API quirks**: Filter param is `platform_ids` (plural). Cover URLs have unencoded spaces (must URL-encode).
  Paginated: `{"items": [...], "total": N}`. List calls page via `lib/romm_paging.py` and append
  `&with_char_index=false&with_filter_values=false` to skip aggregations the server otherwise computes on every request.
- **RomM minimum version**: Requires RomM >= 4.9.0, hard-rejected in `test_connection()` (`_MIN_REQUIRED_VERSION` in
  `main.py`) — the plugin is inert until the server is updated.
- **User-Agent on outgoing HTTP**: SteamGridDB **and** RomM behind Cloudflare Tunnel reject the default `Python-urllib`
  UA with 403. Every HTTP-talking adapter takes a `user_agent: str` ctor param; bootstrap threads
  `decky-romm-sync/<version>` from `package.json` — no hardcoded version strings.
- **Large payloads**: Never send bulk base64 through `decky.emit()` — the WebSocket bridge has size limits. Use per-item
  callables, and chunk bulk lists (the library apply emits shortcuts in batches; the metadata cache loads page-by-page).
- **No `BIsModOrShortcut` bypass**: the bypass counter was removed deliberately. Shortcuts return `true` (natural
  state); we own the game detail UI. Do not reintroduce a bypass.

## Current State

Latest release and shipped features: see `git tag --sort=-v:refname` and GitHub Releases. Roadmap and open work:
[GitHub Projects board](https://github.com/users/danielcopper/projects/2).

## Development

- **Build**: `pnpm build` (Rollup -> dist/index.js)
- **Tests**: backend — `python -m pytest tests/ -q` or `mise run test`; frontend — `mise run test:frontend` (Vitest +
  happy-dom)
- **Coverage**: backend — `python -m pytest tests/ -q --cov=py_modules --cov=main --cov-report=term --cov-branch`;
  frontend — `mise run test:frontend:coverage`
- **Lint**: `mise run lint` (import-linter, the `scripts/check_*` gates, markdownlint). Ruff and basedpyright run only
  inside `mise run gate`.
- **Gate**: `mise run gate` (the full CI battery in one command — mirrors every PR check; slow. Run before pushing.)
- **Setup**: `mise run setup` (installs JS + Python dependencies)
- **Dev reload**: `mise run dev [display]` (build + restart plugin_loader; a display like `dp4` / `internal` also opens
  windowed BPM on it after the deploy)
- **Frontend live dev**: `mise run dev:watch [display]` (one-time `mise run dev:setup`) — hot-reloads the **frontend**
  into windowed Big Picture on every save, no loader restart. **Backend** changes need `mise run dev:push-backend`. Lost
  the Decky UI after leaving BPM: `mise run dev:bpm-reset [display]`. Guide: `docs/contributing/frontend-dev-loop.md`
- **Tooling**: mise manages node, pnpm, python, uv; venv auto-creates at `.venv`. Python deps are pinned in
  `requirements-*.lock`, compiled from `requirements-*.txt` by `uv pip compile`; regenerate with `mise run lock-update`
  after editing a source or bumping a pin.
- **Pre-commit hook** (`.githooks/pre-commit`): formats staged files — `ruff format` + `ruff check` (Python),
  `prettier --write` (TS/TSX), `deno fmt` (Markdown). Stays fast (<2s); heavy validation is CI-only. Do not re-introduce
  heavy checks here.

## Code Quality

CI runs SonarCloud (Quality Gate: 80% coverage on new code, 0 bugs, 0 vulnerabilities), Ruff, basedpyright,
import-linter, pytest-cov branch coverage, and the repo's `scripts/check_*` gates. **The per-rule checks and what each
one enforces are listed in the invariant register below** — that table is the single inventory; do not duplicate it
here.

## Invariant register — cross-cutting safety rules

The audit's clearest pattern: every rule with a mechanical check held; every rule that lived in prose or in a reviewer's
head drifted. This register is the single inventory of the cross-cutting safety rules — the ones that span files, so no
diff-scoped review (human or agent) sees the whole rule — plus the current enforcement tier of each. It is a **map of
the enforcement surface, not the enforcement itself**: a `check`/`test` rule is enforced by the named artifact; a
`prompt-only` rule is not yet mechanized and is injected here so review carries it verbatim until a check exists. The
moment a `prompt-only` rule gets a mechanical check it moves to the `check` tier — a rule is never weakened to stay
green, and a real drift is a finding to triage, never an exemption. `[ours]`

Format: **invariant** — tier — enforced by.

- **Callable failures use `{success, reason, message}` (never `error` / `error_code`)** — check —
  `scripts/check_failure_shape.py --check`
- **A definitive 404 is `not_found`, never `server_unreachable` — a catch-all `except Exception` in `services/` may not
  bind a verdict key (`reason` / `status` / `recommended_action`) to a hardcoded `SERVER_UNREACHABLE`; route the
  exception through `classify_error`, or peel the 404 off with a sibling `except RommNotFoundError` where the verdict is
  a partial-success flag** — check — `scripts/check_404_not_unreachable.py --check`
- **A 404 becomes `RommNotFoundError` only when RomM's entity layer is proven to have answered it; only the three
  byte-stream fetches opt out** — test + prompt-only — `TestNotFoundDiscrimination` plus the per-call-site
  `test_generic_route_404_still_raises_not_found` trio in `tests/adapters/romm/test_http.py`; a fourth byte-stream
  fetch's opt-out is prompt-only — `.claude/rules/romm-http.md`
- **Frontend↔backend callable parity (names + arity)** — check — `scripts/check_callable_manifest.py`
- **Every backend `emit` event name has a frontend listener, and vice versa** — check — `scripts/check_event_parity.py`
- **`settings.json` is written only by its owner (`adapters/persistence.py`)** — check —
  `scripts/check_settings_owner.py`
- **Sync run-lifecycle (`sync_state` / `current_sync_id`) written only via `LibrarySyncStateBox` verbs** — check —
  `scripts/check_sync_lifecycle_owner.py`
- **Aggregate state mutated only via verb-named methods (no field assignment)** — check —
  `scripts/check_aggregate_field_assignment.py`
- **No UoW-opening seam (ActiveCoreResolver, RelaunchOptionsResolver, uow_factory) is called while a UoW is open on the
  same path** — check — `scripts/check_uow_seam_nesting.py`
- **Services never call clocks / sleep / uuid / random directly (inject the Protocol)** — check —
  `scripts/check_cosmic_call_bans.sh`
- **No module in `services/`, `bootstrap/`, `adapters/`, `domain/`, `lib/` or `models/` crosses the ~1000-LOC
  decomposition threshold, and the ones already over it may not grow** — check — `scripts/check_module_size.py` (the
  modules that predate the gate are grandfathered at their exact size; that list only ever gets shorter. `main.py`,
  `_vendor/`, `tests/`, `scripts/` and `src/` are out of scope, each for a reason recorded at `SCOPE_DIRS`)
- **Service-independence contract list stays complete** — check — `scripts/check_service_independence_contract.py`
- **Layer import direction (services ↛ adapters, adapters ↛ services, …)** — check — `.importlinter` (`lint-imports`)
- **Frontend direction: `src/utils/` and `src/api/` never import `src/components/`, and no `src/` module takes part in
  an import cycle** — check — `eslint.config.js` (`import-x/no-restricted-paths`, `import-x/no-cycle`). These rules go
  inert rather than loud when misconfigured: `import-x/extensions` ships as `['.js']`, so until it names `.ts`/`.tsx`
  the plugin resolves an import but never opens the target to read its imports, and `no-cycle` reports nothing on any
  codebase. `src/eslintBoundaries.test.ts` lints known-bad fixtures through the real config and fails if any of the
  three stops reporting — a green `pnpm lint` alone proves nothing. Type-only imports are not edges (erased at runtime),
  which is why the `api/backend.ts` ⇄ `utils/cachedGameDetailStore.ts` back-reference is not a cycle
- **No bare `# type: ignore` / blanket suppressions** — check — `scripts/check_no_bare_ignores.sh`
- **Every pinned version in `requirements-*.lock` satisfies its `requirements-*.txt` source constraint** — check —
  `scripts/check_lock_sync.py`
- **Every local markdown link in tracked docs resolves (file target + heading/attr-list anchor)** — check —
  `scripts/check_markdown_links.py`
- **Every stated RomM minimum version matches the enforced `Plugin._MIN_REQUIRED_VERSION`** — check —
  `scripts/check_romm_min_version.py` (ADRs excluded: frozen history)
- **Server-supplied path components pass `safe_join` (`lib/path_safety.py`)** — test + prompt-only — traversal tests per
  path builder; new call sites are prompt-only
- **No sentinel objects on the wire — explicit JSON-representable tagged values only** — prompt-only — no sentinel
  survives on the wire today (`NO_MIGRATION` retired with #1004, legacy `slot:null` confirmation with #1276), so the
  rule now guards reintroduction; nothing mechanical detects a new one
- **Every destructive op has backup-or-confirm; never delete data that exists nowhere else** — prompt-only — save-file
  removals route through the `.romm-backup` funnel (`MatrixExecutor.quarantine_local_file`; the removed-game cleanup's
  claimed variant is `PruneSaveSupport.quarantine_prune_saves`); every other delete path carries the rule unmechanized.
  Removed-game cleanup takes the **confirm** leg for one case deliberately: installed ROM content the user did not
  select for the recovery bundle is deleted with its row. The ROM is re-downloadable from RomM where a save is not, the
  per-candidate opt-in and its consequence are stated in the confirmation dialog and the user guide, and the row cannot
  be removed at all without a fresh 404 — so this is a disclosed choice, not an exception that drifted in. The adopt
  dialog's **replace** exit is the second such case, and it does **not** rest on that justification: the premise is that
  the content is the user's own — a different rip, a patch, a romhack — which is exactly what the server cannot hand
  back. What carries it instead is that the user is shown both sides, offered a content check, and chooses between two
  named outcomes behind a second confirmation ([ADR-0028](docs/adr/0028-adopted-install-is-an-install.md))
- **Every read-mutate-write of a `RomSaveSyncState` runs under `SyncEngine.rom_lock(rom_id)`** — prompt-only — sync
  paths, `get_save_status`, and the four slot mutations hold the lock; mechanize via a `rom_save_sync_states.save`
  call-site audit
- **Per-slot server reads/deletes go through `domain/save_slot.py` (legacy omits `&slot=`, client-filters)** —
  prompt-only — `get_slot_saves` / `get_slot_delete_info` / `delete_slot` / `list_file_versions` / `rollback_to_version`
  use `slot_query_param` + `save_in_slot`; RomM can't address `slot:null` via the param, so legacy MUST omit it + filter
  client-side, and a legacy delete is refused up-front
- **Every save-sync decision comes from `compute_sync_action` (via `list_saves`), never the `negotiate` op list; every
  automatic upload POSTs `overwrite=false` (409-backstopped); `overwrite=true` only from an explicit `keep_local`** —
  test + prompt-only — the hand-enumerated core cases (`tests/adapters/test_gavel_native_decision_table.py`) and the
  core property tier (`tests/adapters/test_gavel_native_property.py`) + contract 409 tests (`tests/contract/`); new
  upload/dispatch call sites are prompt-only
- **Both save-sync decisions run in the compiled gavel core, reached only through the `ComputeSyncActionFn` /
  `ResolveUploadConflictFn` seams; `domain/sync_action.py` holds only the `SyncAction` vocabulary the core answers in,
  so a change to either decision is a contract change carried by re-copied gavel vectors** — test — both vendored vector
  families run against the core (ladder in `tests/adapters/test_gavel_native.py`, decision table in
  `tests/adapters/test_gavel_native_table_vectors.py`); the `.so` and the vectors are pinned to the same upstream
  release tag and are bumped together
- **`applied_launch_options` is written only by the six recorded-state writer sites (sync ack-commit, download-complete,
  adopt-complete, uninstall, home-migration, version-switch), each recording the exact command the frontend wrote;
  excluded from the sync UPSERT; the only sanctioned reset is Force Full Sync's clear-to-NULL (a wrong recorded value is
  the only path to a wrong delta-skip)** — test + prompt-only — each writer site carries a value-exact test; new
  launch-options write paths are prompt-only — mechanize via a `set_applied_launch_options` /
  `record_applied_launch_options` call-site audit. Download-complete and adopt-complete are one site in the code
  (`RomInstallRecorder.do_record_applied_launch_options`) and two in the flow, because an adopted install is an install
  in every respect (ADR-0028)
- **An abandoned-chunk stash's whole-unit apply staging (`pending_sync` / `pending_all_roms` / `pending_cover_sources`)
  is never mutated while the stash is pending (box IDLE) — every run-entry path passes `try_begin_run`, which clears the
  stash before any staging write** — prompt-only — the invariant holds today rather than being aspirational; mechanize
  via a staging-writer call-site audit
- **A prune run's claim reservation and its refusal of every conflicting callable happen in one atomic gate hold (the
  preview rebuild does not), and frontend-owned Steam work holds a heartbeated, generation-tombstoned lease through
  every continuation's final write** — test + prompt-only — prune service/gate race tests + contract callable-entry
  matrix; new conflicting entry points are prompt-only
- **A prune frontend action mutates Steam only after atomically claiming its exact run/token/discriminant/binding;
  repeats are idempotent and an outcome lost in transit is ambiguous, never success** — test + prompt-only — prune
  service claim tests + `src/utils/pruneActions.test.ts`; new action kinds are prompt-only
- **Every installed-content mutation is authorized by a descriptor-relative no-follow claim (root identity, descendant
  identities, and — where a bundle exists — regular-file hashes) revalidated immediately before it, never by a path
  re-lookup; refusal, partial mutation and ambiguity are reported, never rewritten into success. The hashes bind a
  deletion to bytes held somewhere else, so they follow the **bundle**, not the caller: a source a sealed bundle holds
  consumes the bundle's digest-bound claim, a source it did not capture seals a fresh content-bound one, and a removal
  with no bundle anywhere — recovery off, or a user-initiated uninstall — seals identity-only
  (`claim_source(..., digest=False)`). An identity-only claim is also the only one that may adopt interrupted
  `.{basename}.romm-prune-*` staging, and only where a surviving install row proves the path. Everything else holds for
  both: staging rename, mount checks, no-follow traversal, and exact-identity revalidation under writer exclusion held
  across each unlink. The one guarantee that differs is all-or-nothing: a content-bound removal leases the whole tree up
  front, an identity-only directory leases per unlink (a whole-tree hold hits `EMFILE` and makes large dumps
  un-uninstallable), so a writer arriving mid-loop yields a reported partial removal instead of a clean refusal** —
  test + prompt-only — descriptor-path, recovery-adapter, real RomRemovalService, and prune contract tests; new mutation
  adapters are prompt-only
- **Every prune frame carries its originating preview ID; only a matching pending preview may adopt a run, and an
  accepted contiguous terminal result seals it against every later frame** — test + prompt-only — prune service frame
  tests + `src/utils/pruneStore.test.ts`; new prune frame types are prompt-only
- **Every destructive RomM proof is bound to one canonical server-origin/token-origin/user namespace from preview
  through every exact-ID request; a namespace change is uncertainty, never a 404 deletion authority** — test +
  prompt-only — prune service namespace-race tests; new destructive RomM proof paths are prompt-only
- **Every write into per-rom detail state that crosses an `await` is bound to a rom identity — the store
  (`src/utils/gameDetailStore.ts`) via `writerForRom`, or the answer's own `rom_id` in `applySaveStatus`; the panel
  (`src/components/RomMGameInfoPanel.tsx`) via `RomBinding`. A version switch re-keys without closing, so neither the
  store's generation counter nor the panel's `[appId]` effect sees this class. Four writes are unbound and none of them
  is safe by construction: the two identity writes install what a binding would compare against (`loadDetail` is ordered
  by `loadSeq`, `loadData` is not — #1717); the store's `cached.bios_status` fold runs in the same synchronous run as
  its guard; the panel's `handleBiosChange` answers for the platform's default core and can overwrite a rom-keyed answer
  (#1718). The panel's two lazy tab lanes write through the raw setter, discarded by their own per-run `cancelled` —
  with the commit-time window #1717 records. The play button is NOT covered (#1714)** — test + prompt-only — the panel's
  ten bound sites each carry a version-switch test (`src/components/RomMGameInfoPanel.test.tsx`); the store side and
  every new write site on either are prompt-only, because a checker scoped to the store's own function bodies would be
  green on the case this rule was written for. The reasons behind both mechanisms live at `writerForRom` and
  `RomBinding` — do not restate them here

When a change applies a guard / sanitize / backup / grouping pattern, sweep for sibling sites of the same pattern — the
register is what that sweep checks against.

## Security

- NEVER read or use credentials from settings files (`~/homebrew/settings/`) without explicit user permission
- NEVER pass credentials to agents — if API calls are needed, ask the user to run them and provide output
- NEVER log secrets (passwords, API keys) — mask them in any log output

## Working Style

- **Research before implementing.** When encountering an unknown (how a third-party tool works, where files are stored,
  what APIs exist), STOP and research first. Present findings and agree on an approach before implementation.
- **Discuss architecture decisions.** This is not a vibe coding project. Non-trivial changes require discussion before
  code is written. When you find a problem, explain it and propose options — don't just start fixing.
- **Use agents** for everything beyond trivial single-file edits — research, exploration, implementation. Keep main
  context on architecture and coordination.
- **Sequential agent discipline.** Each agent's prompt MUST include: "When done, report back and wait for shutdown. Do
  NOT pick up other tasks from the task list."
- **Preserve context.** Get alignment first, then implement cleanly in one pass.
- **Sub-issue policy**: epic bodies do **not** carry markdown sub-issue lists — open work is tracked via GitHub's native
  Sub-Issues panel. Link new sub-issues natively; don't add body bullets.
