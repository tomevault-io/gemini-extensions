# AGENTS.md — guide for any agent contributing to phantombot

This file is for **any agent (human or LLM) working on the phantombot codebase itself**. If you're a Claude Code session, an OpenAI-Codex agent, a future maintainer, or just yourself catching up after time away — read this before opening a PR. It captures the small set of project-specific conventions that aren't obvious from the code.

> **Naming-collision warning.** This `/AGENTS.md` (project root) is **not the same as** `personas/<name>/AGENTS.md` (a persona-specific tool-hint file phantombot reads when loading that persona). They share a name because OpenClaw uses the same convention for persona files; phantombot's persona loader accepts both `tools.md` and `AGENTS.md` as the persona-tools slot. If a contributor refers to "AGENTS.md" without context, they almost always mean *this* file (the repo-level one). If you're editing a file under `personas/` or `agents/`, you're touching a persona, not the contributor guide.

## The contributing discipline (READ FIRST)

**Every PR that changes user-facing behavior, architecture, or developer workflow must update both `README.md` and this file in the same PR.** No exceptions. Reviewers should reject PRs where the docs don't match the code.

What "user-facing behavior" means:
- New / removed / renamed CLI subcommand or flag
- Change to systemd unit shape (added/removed timer, new `EnvironmentFile=`, etc.)
- Change to where files live (config path, memory db path, persona dir, lockfile)
- Change to credential discovery / hygiene rules
- Change to release pipeline (asset names, version scheme, trigger)
- Change to architecture invariants (single persona at runtime, runLock, etc.)

What's *not* user-facing and doesn't need a docs update:
- Pure refactors that preserve behavior
- Bug fixes that restore the documented behavior
- Internal lib changes with no public API change
- Tests

If unsure, update the docs. Cheaper than the post-merge "wait, the README says X but the code does Y" archeology.

## Build / test / typecheck

```bash
~/.bun/bin/bun install                  # install deps (cron-parser, citty, smol-toml, @clack/prompts)
~/.bun/bin/bun tsc --noEmit             # typecheck
~/.bun/bin/bun test                     # full test suite
~/.bun/bin/bun test tests/lib-X.test.ts # one file
~/.bun/bin/bun run build                # → dist/phantombot (linux x64-baseline; ~98 MB)
~/.bun/bin/bun run build:arm64          # → dist/phantombot-arm64 (cross-compile)
```

`bun-version` is pinned to `1.x` in CI for reproducibility (see `.github/workflows/release.yml`).

The build target **must remain `bun-linux-x64-baseline`** (not plain `bun-linux-x64`). The supervisor box that runs kai is pre-AVX2 silicon; the non-baseline binary SIGILLs on launch there. If you "optimise" to plain x64, you'll break production. See PR #37 for the post-mortem.

## Architecture at a glance

- **Citty CLI dispatcher** (`src/cli/index.ts`) → subcommand → orchestrator (for turn-spending commands like `run`, `ask`, `tick`, `nightly`).
- **One-turn coordinator** (`src/orchestrator/turn.ts`) loads persona files, loads recent turns from memory, builds system prompt, **screens untrusted input** (`screen.ts`), runs the harness chain, and persists the user+assistant turns on success.
- **Harness chain** (`src/orchestrator/fallback.ts` + `lib/harnessRunner.ts`) tries primary; if it returns a recoverable error, falls through to the next (with per-harness cooldown for fast fallback).
- **Security perimeter** (`lib/threatJudge.ts` + `orchestrator/screen.ts`) — trusted principals act directly; untrusted input is judged in code before any capable harness sees it. See "Security perimeter".
- **Channels** are a channel-agnostic core + thin per-channel adapters (`src/channels/core/` + `src/channels/telegram/`); `phantombot run` is the long-running process. See "Channel layer".
- **Env bootstrap** (`lib/envBootstrap.ts`) self-sources the `.env` files at startup (required on macOS, no-op on Linux) and re-sources before each harness spawn so `phantombot env set` takes effect mid-session.
- **Tick fires scheduled tasks** (`src/cli/tick.ts`); 1-minute systemd timer; lockfile prevents overlap; missed runs are skipped, not piled up.
- **Heartbeat is mechanical** (no LLM); **nightly is cognitive** (LLM-driven distillation).

## Channel layer (core + adapters)

As of #168 the channel layer is split into a **channel-agnostic core** and **thin per-channel adapters**, so a second transport (Matrix, Slack, …) is a small adapter rather than a fork of the engine.

- **`src/channels/core/`** is channel-blind. `engine.ts` holds the streaming turn engine + server loop (moved verbatim out of the old `telegram.ts`); `routing.ts` is the pure group-reply decision; `prompts.ts` holds the channel-layer prompt suffixes (`VOICE_REPLY_INSTRUCTION`, the capture nudge, the voice-unavailable message); `types.ts` defines the contract: `Channel` / `ChannelTransport` / `ChannelMessage`, a `ChannelCapabilities` object (`voice` / `typing` / `attachments` / `encryption`), and `encrypt`/`decrypt` hook signatures.
- **`src/channels/telegram/`** is the first adapter: `transport.ts` (HTTP client), `parse.ts` (update → `ChannelMessage`), `channel.ts` (capabilities + encrypt/decrypt).
- **`src/channels/telegram.ts`** is now a **backward-compat barrel** that re-exports the core + adapter symbols under their old names, so importers and the test suite kept their surface unchanged across the refactor.

Two invariants worth knowing before you touch this:

1. **IDs are channel-neutral strings.** The core speaks `conversationId: string` / `senderId: string`. Telegram's numeric ids are normalized at the adapter boundary only — `String(chat.id)` on ingest (`parse.ts`), and `Number(conversationId)` right before the Telegram API call (`transport.ts`). Don't reintroduce a numeric id into the core contract; Matrix/Slack ids aren't numbers. The numeric update-notify recipient ids (`updateNotify.ts`, `notify.ts`) and the slash-command logging id are separate, Telegram-specific, and converted at their own boundary.
2. **The encrypt/decrypt seam is placed but empty.** Telegram's `encrypt`/`decrypt` are identity pass-throughs (Telegram bots have no E2EE) with `encryption: false`. They return `T | Promise<T>` so async crypto (Matrix Megolm) can slot in later with no signature change. There is deliberately **zero crypto code and zero Matrix code** — the actual Matrix adapter + E2EE are parked for the community discussion in issue #154.

## Security perimeter — trusted vs untrusted input

Phantombot runs a **two-tier perimeter**, enforced in code (not by trusting a model's say-so — the bug that prompted this design was a model *claiming* it had notified/recorded when it hadn't).

- **Trusted** input — an authenticated Telegram principal — is acted on directly. The principal *is* the gate; no screening.
- **Untrusted** input — email, web, Twilio, webhooks, raw `phantombot ask`, any future app — is read by a **tool-less threat judge** (`lib/threatJudge.ts`) before any capable harness runs. `orchestrator/screen.ts` (`makeScreener`, wired into `turn.ts` like `makeRetriever`) does the side-effecting orchestration around the pure judge: it first **briefs** the judge with semantic recall from the threat-relevant drawers (`decisions` = prior rulings, `people` = known senders, `norms` = what's routine), then the judge returns a 0–100 threat score. Below threshold → green-lit silently; at/above → the untrusted turn is **HELD** (does nothing) and surfaced to the principal.
- A **ruling is only recorded from a trusted turn** — the judge and the untrusted turn never write decisions. When the principal concludes, the ruling (with its weight) is captured to the `decisions` drawer so the next similar screening recalls it.

If you add a new untrusted entry point (a new inbound channel, a new `ask`-style API), it MUST route through the screener — don't let untrusted content reach a harness unscreened.

## Persona model — single at runtime

**One persona is active at a time.** This surprises people. The persona "library" on disk (under `~/.local/share/phantombot/personas/`) can have many directories, but `phantombot run` binds to one — `config.defaultPersona` — and the `runLock` (`src/lib/runLock.ts`) prevents two `phantombot run` processes from coexisting on the same box. If a feature needs "different personas for different chats" or "two personas at once," that's a real architectural change (per-persona Telegram tokens, per-persona XDG dirs, lifted runLock) — not a config knob. The README's [Personas](README.md#personas) section is the authoritative explanation; if you change this model, update both.

## Service model (systemd + launchd)

Phantombot ships on **Linux (systemd --user)** and **macOS (launchd, per-user LaunchAgents)**. `lib/platform.ts` is the single router that decides which backend to talk to; `lib/systemd.ts` and `lib/launchd.ts` are the two backends behind a common `ServiceControl` surface (each takes an injectable runner — `SystemctlRunner` / `LaunchctlRunner` — so tests never touch the real service manager). The four logical units are identical across platforms; only the unit-file shape and control verbs differ.

On Linux, `phantombot install` creates **four** systemd-user units:

| Unit | Cadence | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `phantombot.service` | always-on | `phantombot run` — Telegram listener |
| `phantombot-heartbeat.timer` → `.service` | every 30 min | mechanical maintenance, no LLM |
| `phantombot-nightly.timer` → `.service` | daily 02:00 | cognitive distillation, LLM |
| `phantombot-tick.timer` → `.service` | every 1 min | fires due scheduled tasks |

Every service has **two `EnvironmentFile=` lines**:

```
EnvironmentFile=-%h/.config/phantombot/.env    # phantombot's own secrets (TTS keys)
EnvironmentFile=-%h/.env                        # user's general credentials
```

Leading `-` makes both optional (no error if either file is absent). The merged `process.env` is what spawned harnesses inherit, so the agent finds credentials without re-reading either file.

**macOS has no `EnvironmentFile=` equivalent.** launchd plists can't source a file, so on macOS `lib/envBootstrap.ts` self-loads both `.env` files into `process.env` at startup (existing values win, so nothing already set is clobbered). On Linux this is a cheap no-op because systemd already sourced them. Either way, harnesses also call `reloadEnvFiles()` before each spawn so a freshly-written `phantombot env set` secret is visible mid-session without a restart.

Service units also set a deterministic `PATH` that includes `~/.local/bin` plus stable user harness shim locations such as `~/.local/share/pi-node/bin` and `~/.local/share/pi-node/current/bin`. Do not rely on interactive shell startup files for service harness discovery. When Phantombot finds a harness in PATH or common npm/pi-node versioned locations, it saves the absolute path in `state.json` and executes that path directly on later starts. `phantombot run` must never fail startup just because a harness binary is missing; log loudly, keep the headless service alive, and let `phantombot doctor` report/repair the configured chain.

If you change a unit body (any `generate*` function in `src/lib/systemd.ts`), `ensureUnitCurrent` will detect the on-disk unit as stale on the next `phantombot voice` / `phantombot harness` / etc. run and rewrite it automatically. The previous body is preserved as `${unitPath}.bak` for rollback.

## Credentials

Two .env files, two roles:

- **`~/.config/phantombot/.env`** — phantombot-managed (TTS keys, written by `phantombot voice`).
- **`~/.env`** — user-managed (`GITHUB_TOKEN` etc., written by `phantombot env set`).

The agent NEVER `echo … >> ~/.env`. It uses `phantombot env set NAME "value"` (atomic write, mode 0o600). The full credential discovery + hygiene rules are baked into every persona's system prompt via `CREDENTIALS_SECTION` in `src/persona/builder.ts` — the agent inherits them automatically. If you change those rules, update both `CREDENTIALS_SECTION` and the README's [Credentials](README.md#credentials-phantombot-env) section.

## Release pipeline

Every merged PR auto-releases `v1.0.<PR_NUMBER>`. The workflow at `.github/workflows/release.yml`:

1. Triggers on `pull_request: closed` + `merged == true` + `branches: main`.
2. Checks out the merge-commit SHA (not main HEAD; pins to exactly the code that merged).
3. Runs `bun tsc --noEmit` and `bun test` as gates.
4. `sed -i "s/0.1.0-dev/1.0.${PR_NUMBER}/" src/version.ts` (replaces only the literal placeholder, preserves the doc comment block).
5. Cross-compiles `bun-linux-x64-baseline` and `bun-linux-arm64`.
6. Computes `SHA256SUMS`.
7. `gh release create v1.0.<PR_NUMBER> --target <merge_commit_sha> …` so the git tag is pinned to the commit, not the moving HEAD.

`phantombot update` reads this feed via the GitHub Releases API.

**Versioning is intentionally not semver.** `1.0.<PR_NUMBER>` — patch is the PR number, ordered by merge time, not semantic impact. Don't bolt semver-aware logic on (`phantombot update --major-only` etc.); the version string can't carry that information.

## How to add a new subcommand

1. **Write the file** at `src/cli/<name>.ts`. Export `defineCommand({ … })` as default and a `run<Name>` function for testability (the function takes injectable deps + returns an exit code).
2. **Register** in `src/cli/index.ts` `subCommands` (alphabetical order).
3. **Update the test** in `tests/cli.test.ts` — the `expect(names).toEqual([…])` list must include the new subcommand.
4. **Test the function directly** (in `tests/cli-<name>.test.ts`) by injecting fake deps. Don't drive `defineCommand` end-to-end; @clack/prompts is non-TTY-hostile in tests.
5. **Update README** — add the command to the "Commands" section.
6. **Update AGENTS.md** if the command introduces new conventions (a new lockfile, a new file location, a new credential interaction).

## Testing conventions

- **Per-test `mkdtemp`**, never write to real `~/.config/phantombot/` or `~/.local/share/phantombot/`. Each test creates an isolated workdir in `os.tmpdir()` and cleans it in `afterEach`. The `installPhantombotUnit` test pollution from PR #44 was exactly this problem (untracked).
- **Mock external IO** via fetch override (`globalThis.fetch = …`), `SystemctlRunner` injection, `TelegramTransport` injection, etc.
- **Don't drive @clack/prompts** in tests — it requires a TTY and will hang in CI. Either extract a prompt-free helper (the `maybeUpgradeUnit` / `ConfirmFn` pattern) or inject a stub confirm.
- **Tests should pass on a fresh clean Linux runner.** If a test passes locally but fails in the GH workflow, suspect environment leakage (real systemd dir, real $HOME, etc.) — see PR #43 / #44.

## Common pitfalls

1. **`bun-linux-x64` instead of baseline** — SIGILLs on pre-AVX2 hardware. Use `bun-linux-x64-baseline`. Documented at the top of `.github/workflows/release.yml`.
2. **`echo … > src/version.ts` in CI** — would clobber the comment block. Use `sed -i "s/0.1.0-dev/$VERSION/" src/version.ts` instead. The placeholder literal must round-trip exactly; if you change `version.ts`, also update the sed pattern in the workflow.
3. **`sudo cp` to install someone's binary** — leaves `.bak` root-owned, blocks future `phantombot update` from the unprivileged user. Use `sudo install -o <user> -g <group> -m 755 …`. Documented in PR #47's repro.
4. **`copyFile` over an existing foreign-owned file** — fails with EACCES because `O_TRUNC` checks the existing file's mode. `applyUpdate` unlinks `.bak` first; if you add similar copy logic, do the same.
5. **@clack/prompts confirm in non-TTY context** — returns the cancel sentinel. If you write code that calls `p.confirm` directly and expect a boolean, tests will hit the cancel path silently. Prefer `ConfirmFn` injection (see `src/cli/harness.ts`).
6. **Forgetting `tests/cli.test.ts` subcommand list** — every new subcommand needs to be added there or that test fails on PR merge.
7. **Creating/importing/restoring a persona on a fresh box without setting it as default** — the built-in fallback `default_persona = "phantom"` doesn't have a directory; `phantombot run` would fail with "persona 'phantom' not found." Every persona-producing path (`runImportPersona`, `runImportFromPath`, `runRestoreArchive`, `applyPersona`) calls `adoptAsDefaultIfMissing` from `src/lib/personaDefault.ts` so the new persona becomes default when there's no working default. If you add another persona-producing path, call it too — and add a `state.json` isolation `beforeEach` to its tests so they don't pollute the real `~/.local/share/phantombot/state.json`.
8. **`install.sh` piped to `sh` runs without a TTY** — interactive @clack TUIs would misbehave. The script detects this with `[ -t 0 ] && [ -t 1 ]` before launching the persona TUI, and prints the next-step hint instead. If you add interactive setup steps to the install flow, repeat the check.
9. **Adding a new harness — three places that must be touched, not one.** `src/harnesses/buildChain.ts` (factory: instantiate the wrapper class), `src/cli/harness.ts` (`SUPPORTED_HARNESSES` for the TUI + `detectAvailability` for the binary-on-PATH check), and `src/config.ts` (Config type slot + loader for `[harnesses.<id>]`). Plus inline test fixtures across ~12 files that have a literal Config object. If you forget any, typecheck + tests catch it — but it's tedious; the buildChain.ts extraction was specifically to retire the *fourth* duplicate that was about to land with each new harness.
10. **Channel-specific behavior belongs in the channel layer, not in personas.** Brevity for voice replies, formatting for Slack, etc. should be appended to the system prompt at the channel boundary (see `VOICE_REPLY_INSTRUCTION` in `src/channels/core/prompts.ts`, passed via `runTurn`'s `systemPromptSuffix`). Putting "be brief on voice" in a persona's BOOT.md/SOUL.md throttles text replies too — and persists across all the persona's contexts where verbosity is fine. Channel-layer suffixes are scoped to the turn that needs them.

11. **Reply modality is mirror-input by default, with a per-message text override available.** `processChatMessage` in `src/channels/core/engine.ts` picks the wire format (sendMessage vs sendVoice) via `replyModalityOverride()` from `src/lib/audio.ts`: when the user's message (post-STT, so voice transcripts count) contains an explicit directive like *"reply in text"*, *"no voice"*, or *"send a voice note"*, that wins; otherwise modality mirrors input. The override is parsed by a small, deliberately conservative regex set — anchored on reply-verbs and unmistakable shorthand, no bare-noun matches ("text message to John" must not trigger). Voice is still capped by `ttsSupported(config)`: an override asking for voice when no TTS provider is configured degrades to text gracefully, same as the original no-TTS fallback. If you extend the regex set, add cases to `replyModalityOverride` in `tests/lib-audio.test.ts` AND to the three end-to-end scenarios in `tests/channels-telegram.test.ts` (voice-in→text, text-in→voice, text-in→voice-without-TTS).

12. **`GITHUB_TOKEN` for `phantombot update` isn't always safe to send.** GitHub App installation tokens are scoped to a single org's repos; using one against the public `phantomyard/phantombot` releases endpoint returns 401 even though the endpoint is anonymously reachable. `findLatestRelease` in `src/lib/githubReleases.ts` therefore retries once *without* the auth header on 401/403 before failing, and the final error mentions org-scoping explicitly. If you add another auth'd GitHub API call (e.g. for changelog fetch, asset metadata, etc.), reuse the `buildHeaders(withAuth)` helper and replicate the unauth-retry path — otherwise users with org-scoped tokens hit a dead end on what should be a public read. See issue #115 / PR #120.

## Process for updating this file

If your PR does any of the things in the "contributing discipline" list above, **before opening the PR**:

1. Re-read the relevant section here. Does it still describe what the code does?
2. If not, edit. The PR description should mention `AGENTS.md` updated alongside `README.md` and the code.
3. If your change introduces a new common pitfall (something a future contributor would trip on), add it to the **Common pitfalls** section.

This file is short on purpose. Don't pad it. Each section earns its place by saving someone else 20 minutes of archeology.
