Recent fixes (Dec 25, 2025)
---------------------------
### Music Persistence & Reliability (v0.2.0)
- **Local Music Player**:
    - Fixed race condition where "Play Music" command failed if SD card wasn't fully ready at boot.
    - Added auto-initialization check: if player is not ready when "Play Music" is called, it attempts to initialize immediately.
- **Voice Pipeline**:
    - Increased `pipeline_cmd_queue` send timeout from 0 to 100ms to prevent dropping critical commands (like STOP_WWD) when the system is busy.
    - Improved robustness of music pipeline switching logic.

### Voice-Triggered Music Fix (v0.2.1)
- **Voice Pipeline**:
    - Fixed issue where voice-triggered "Play Music" command would hang the system.
    - Implemented `PIPELINE_CMD_MUSIC_CONTROL` to safely stop the microphone and wait for resource release before starting music playback.

### Stability Improvements (v0.2.2)
- **Voice Pipeline**:
    - Increased `pipeline_task` stack size from 4KB to 8KB to prevent stack overflow crashes during music playback (file I/O + codec operations).
    - Added watchdog feeding (`sys_diag_wdt_feed()`) during heavy music initialization steps to prevent WDT resets.

### Critical Stability Fix (v0.2.3)
- **Voice Pipeline**:
    - Further increased `pipeline_task` stack size to 12KB. 8KB proved insufficient for simultaneous file operations and text-to-speech handling.
    - Added `audio_capture_stop_wait` during initialization to ensure clean audio state.

### Music/TTS Conflict Fix (v0.2.4)
- **Voice Pipeline**:
    - Implemented TTS suppression when music command is detected. This prevents Home Assistant's TTS ("Playing music") from conflicting with the music player's codec usage, which was causing the device to hang/block.

### Internal RAM Fix (v0.2.5)
- **Voice Pipeline**:
    - Moved `pipeline_task` stack allocation from internal RAM to PSRAM. The 12KB stack was exhausting internal RAM, causing MQTT/network failures ("out of memory", "thread_sem_init: out of memory").

Recent fixes (Dec 24, 2025)
---------------------------
### Comprehensive Bug Fixes (v0.1.9)
- **Critical Memory Safety**: 
    - Fixed use-after-free in `fetch_task` (moved cleanup to `audio_capture_stop_wait`).
    - Fixed memory leaks in `voice_pipeline.c` (`current_pipeline_handler`), `ha_client.c` (`audio_frame_buf`), and `ha_client_start_conversation` (missing malloc check).
    - Fixed race conditions with `callback_mux` spinlock in `ha_client.c` and `is_running` flag in `audio_capture.c`.
    - Added missing null checks for `cJSON_PrintUnformatted` and `malloc`.
- **Functionality**:
    - **AGC**: Stub functions now correctly return `false`/`ESP_ERR_NOT_SUPPORTED` instead of misleading success.
    - **TTS**: Buffer overflow warning now includes size information (`used/max`).
    - **Cleanup**: Proper null termination for `strncpy` in MQTT handlers.
- **Code Quality**:
    - Removed redundant `extern` declarations from `tts_player.c` and `beep_tone.c`.
    - Replaced magic numbers with named constants (`BEEP_WAKE_*`, `BEEP_CONFIRM_*`, `BEEP_ERROR_*`).
    - Removed conflicting "Local Time Question" feature (now handled via LLM system prompt).

Recent fixes (Dec 20, 2025)
---------------------------
### OTA + WebSerial reliability
- OTA now validates HTTP status, supports unknown `Content-Length`, logs errors clearly, and uses PSRAM stack fallback if needed.
- WebSerial HTTP header limit raised to 8192 to avoid `431 Request Header Fields Too Large` on large requests.
- OTA start failures now log error names for faster diagnosis.

### MQTT + HA entities
- `sw_version` uses `esp_app_get_description()->version` (include `esp_app_desc.h`).
- WebSerial metric renamed to `webserial_requests` (it counts log requests, not active clients).
- Legacy MQTT discovery cleanup clears old/duplicated entities on connect; update `legacy_discovery_topics` when renaming/removing entity IDs.
- Added `diagnostic_dump` button (MQTT) to emit `sys_diag_report_status`.

### Audio behavior
- Timer/alarm beep now plays at max volume and then restores the previous output volume.
- Guard against empty response text before indexing in voice pipeline response handling.

Recent fixes (Dec 17, 2025)
---------------------------
### LED Status Improvements
- **SPEAKING LED**: Cyan fast pulsing (300ms period) triggered on `tts-start` event, not `tts-end`.
- **OTA LED**: White fast pulsing (300ms period) during firmware updates.
- LED status log now includes task name for debugging: `LED status: X -> Y [task_name]`.
- Fixed LED timing: LED is set to SPEAKING *before* TTS download starts, stays cyan during playback.

### WWD Threshold Runtime Control
- Added `wwd_set_threshold(float threshold)` and `wwd_get_threshold()` to `wwd.c/wwd.h`.
- MQTT control uses runtime function instead of full WWD reinit.
- Fixed MQTT threshold range from 0.3-0.9 to valid 0.5-0.95.

### CYD Display Integration
- Fixed `va_response` MQTT sensor not being published.
- Speech text now extracted from `intent-end` event (`response.speech.plain.speech`).
- Both `va_status` and `va_response` sensors work for CYD display.

Previous fixes (Dec 2025)
-------------------------
- Wake word capture: mic path unmuted by removing unsupported `set_in_mute`, gain set before `esp_codec_dev_open`. Stereo interleaved is compacted to mono; WWD stats log peak/nz periodically.
- HA streaming: audio send timeout raised to 500 ms to reduce ws lock contention; audio chunks dropped (warn only) if HA socket is not ready; WWD resume delayed after TTS to avoid re-trigger/slowdown.
- Guard delays: 300 ms before WWD start + 200 ms after start; 600 ms delay after TTS before resuming WWD.

Build/Flash
-----------
- Versioning: before every build after code changes, bump the firmware name/version (start from `P4-HA-VA-0.0.1`).
- Build: `python build.py` (requires ESP-IDF 5.5 env). If shell lacks IDF activation, run the standard `export.bat`/`install.ps1` first.
- Flash: `python flash.py -p COMXX` (default COM13). If COM port is busy, close all monitors/esptool or replug USB (sometimes Windows requires a reboot to release the port).
- OTA: run `python -m http.server 8080` from repo root (or `ota_server.bat`); set URL to `http://<PC_IP>:8080/build/esp32_p4_voice_assistant.bin`, then trigger OTA via MQTT (`esp32p4/ota_url_input/set`, `esp32p4/ota_trigger/set = ON`) or HA button.
- If build fails with "Cannot find component list file", run `idf.py reconfigure` (after `export.bat`) then rebuild.

Runtime Tips
------------
- If WWD stats show `peak=0`, check codec open errors in log and ensure `bsp_extra_codec_set_fs` succeeds; verify SD model path only if CONFIG_MODEL_IN_SDCARD is enabled.
- I2S warnings "dma frame num is adjusted…" are benign (alignment to 256 frames).
- WebSocket disconnects: capture handler now ignores sends while disconnected; pipeline continues. If HA link is flaky, consider increasing `HA_SEND_AUDIO_TIMEOUT_MS` further (main/ha_client.c).
- TTS "slow" or re-trigger: ensured guard delays before/after WWD resume. If still slow, lengthen the delays in `AUDIO_CMD_RESUME_WWD` or `tts_playback_complete_handler`.

LED Status Reference
--------------------
| Status | Color | Effect | Period |
|--------|-------|--------|--------|
| IDLE | Green (dim) | Solid | - |
| LISTENING | Blue | Pulsing | 1000ms |
| PROCESSING | Yellow | Blinking | 500ms |
| SPEAKING | Cyan | Fast pulsing | 300ms |
| OTA | White | Fast pulsing | 300ms |
| ERROR | Red | Fast blinking | 200ms |
| CONNECTING | Blue | Breathing | 2000ms |

Files touched in latest changes
-------------------------------
- `main/led_status.c` – SPEAKING/OTA fast pulsing (300ms), debug task name in log.
- `main/ha_client.c` – LED set in `tts-start`, speech extraction from `intent-end` for CYD.
- `main/ota_update.c` – LED_STATUS_OTA on update start, restore to IDLE on failure.
- `main/wwd.c` / `main/wwd.h` – `wwd_set_threshold()` and `wwd_get_threshold()` for runtime control.
- `main/main.c` – MQTT threshold callback uses runtime function, range 0.5-0.95.

Known quirks
------------
- Windows ACL: previously `.git` had DENY on write; ensure permissions allow creating `.git/index.lock` before git add/commit.
- COM port locking: if `Access is denied` persists, replug board or reboot to release COMxx.
- `text` field in `tts-end` event is NULL in some HA versions; speech text must be extracted from `intent-end` instead.
