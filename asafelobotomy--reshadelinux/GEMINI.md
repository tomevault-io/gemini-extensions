## §1 — Lean Principles

| # | Principle | This project |
|---|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | Eliminate waste (Muda) | Every line of code has a cost; every unused feature is waste |
| 2 | Map the value stream | Shell scripts run by user → Wine/Proton game prefixes updated with ReShade DLLs and shaders → enhanced visuals at game runtime |
| 3 | Create flow | User runs script → Steam library scanned → game selected → ReShade downloaded and installed into Wine prefix → shaders configured |
| 4 | Establish pull | Build only what is needed, when it is needed |
| 5 | Seek perfection | Small, continuous improvements (Kaizen) over big rewrites |

**Waste taxonomy** (§6):

- Overproduction · Waiting · Transport · Over-processing · Inventory · Motion · Defects · Unused talent

---

## §2 — Standardised Work Baselines

| Baseline | Value | Action if exceeded |
|----------|-------|--------------------|
| File LOC (warn) | 250 lines | Flag, suggest decomposition |
| File LOC (hard) | 400 lines | Refuse to extend; decompose first |
| Dependency budget | 6 runtime deps | Propose removal before adding |
| Dependency budget (warn) | 5 runtime deps | Flag for review |
| Test command | `bash tests/run_simple_tests.sh` | Must pass before the full task is done |
| Type check | `echo "no type check configured"` | Must pass before task is done |
| Three-check ritual | `bash tests/run_simple_tests.sh && echo "type-check: N/A"` | Run before marking complete |
| Integration test gate | INTEGRATION_TESTS=1 <!-- TODO: fill once known --> | Set to run integration tests |
| Max subagent depth | 3 | Stop and report to user |

---

## §3 — PDCA Cycle

Apply to every non-trivial change.

**Plan**: State the goal. List the files that will change. Estimate LOC delta. For non-trivial tasks that span multiple files or introduce new behaviour, write a brief requirements summary before coding. Realign before proceeding if that summary changes the plan.
**Do**: Implement. Write tests alongside code, not after.
**Check**: During intermediate phases or multi-part tasks, run the narrowest deterministic targeted suites for the touched paths when available. If the blast radius includes shared helpers, broad contract surfaces, or no reliable mapping exists, broaden aggressively. Run `bash tests/run_simple_tests.sh` only before marking the full user task complete end-to-end. Review output. Fix before proceeding.
**Act**: If baseline exceeded, address it now. Summarise what changed.

### Test Scope Policy

| Tier | Meaning | Use when |
|------|---------|----------|
| `PathTargeted` | Narrow deterministic checks mapped to touched paths | Default during intermediate work |
| `AffectedSuite` | Broader checks for shared helpers or broad contract surfaces | Path-targeted coverage is too narrow |
| `FullSuite` | Entire local test suite | Before marking the full task complete |
| `MergeGate` | Verified state required before merge, release, or final handoff | The change is ready to leave the working session |

- **Task complete** means the full user-visible task is finished end-to-end and the required verification has passed, not that one phase of a larger plan is done and not that one item in a multi-part TODO list is done.
- During intermediate phases, prefer deterministic path-based targeted suites tied to the files or directories actually touched.
- If the repo documents a targeted-test selector or phase-test command, use it to choose deterministic phase checks from changed paths instead of guessing the phase-time suite set manually.
- If multiple sub-parts are still in progress, do not treat a passing targeted subset as permission to declare the whole task complete.
- Broaden early when changes touch shared helpers, broad policy surfaces, parity mirrors, or any area without a reliable targeted test mapping.
- Final gate: before marking the full task complete, run the full suite with `bash tests/run_simple_tests.sh`.

### Structured Thinking Discipline

Before acting on any medium-to-complex task, apply this decision sequence to avoid
loop traps and wasted tokens:

1. **Frame** — state the problem in one sentence. If you cannot, the task needs
   decomposition before proceeding.
2. **Intent-Gate** — if the prompt is ambiguous, compound, or lacks scope, ask
  one clarifying question before acting. Never start execution on a prompt
  that could plausibly mean two different things.
3. **Gather** — identify the minimum information needed to act. Search once with
   broad terms; do not repeat the same search with minor variations.
4. **Decide** — choose an approach and commit. If two approaches seem equal, pick
   either and move forward. Do not oscillate.
5. **Act** — implement the chosen approach in one pass. Do not re-read files you
   have already read unless the content has changed.
6. **Verify** — check the result once. If it fails, diagnose the root cause before
   retrying. Never retry the same action expecting a different result.

**Anti-loop rules** (apply to all agents and subagents):

- **3-strike rule**: if the same tool call or search returns unhelpful results
  three times, stop and reformulate the approach or ask the user for guidance.
- **No circular re-reads**: do not re-read a file within the same task unless
  you have made changes to it since the last read.
- **Monotonic progress**: each step must produce new information or new output.
  If a step produces nothing new, skip it and move to the next.
- **Scope lock**: once Plan is set, do not expand scope mid-task. If new work
  is discovered, note it for a follow-up task.
- **Time-box exploration**: limit exploratory searches to 5 tool calls per
  sub-question. If the answer is not found, surface the gap to the user.

---

## §4 — Coding Conventions

- Language: **Bash/Shell** · Runtime: **bash 5.3** · Package manager: **N/A**
- Test framework: **custom bash (run_simple_tests.sh)**
- Preferred serialisation: **JSON**

**Patterns observed in this codebase**:

- - Modular sourcing — main scripts source from `lib/` for separation of concerns
- `set -euo pipefail` strict mode in all modules
- YAD/whiptail dialogs for GUI/TUI interfaces
- Custom logging with coloured output via `lib/logging.sh`
- Steam registry parsing for automatic game detection

**Universal rules**:

- No `any` / untyped unless explicitly commented with `// deliberately untyped: <reason>`.
- No silent error swallowing — log or re-throw.
- No commented-out code — git history is the undo stack.
- Imports are grouped: stdlib → third-party → internal. One blank line between groups.
- Functions do one thing. If you need "and" in the name, split it.
**Terminal discipline**: See `.github/instructions/terminal.instructions.md`. Key rule: never mutate the persistent terminal session's shell state with strict-mode commands.

---

## §5 — Operating Modes

Switch modes explicitly. Default is **Implement**.

### Implement Mode (default)

- Plan → implement → test → document in one uninterrupted flow.

Three-check ritual before marking a full task complete end-to-end:

1. `bash tests/run_simple_tests.sh && echo "type-check: N/A"` — Must pass before the full task is done.
2. Documentation updated (README, CHANGELOG, inline).
3. Smoke test manually if meaningful UI/API changed.

### Review Mode

- Read-only by default. State findings before proposing fixes.
- Tag every finding with a waste category (§6).
- Use format: `[severity] | [file:line] | [waste category] | [description]`
- Severity: `critical` | `major` | `minor` | `advisory`

  <examples>
  `[critical] | [src/auth.ts:42] | [W7 Defects] | SQL query built by string concatenation — injection risk; use parameterised queries`
  `[minor] | [src/utils/format.ts:18] | [W4 Over-processing] | One-liner wrapped in a function with no added value — consider inlining`
  </examples>

#### On-Demand Review Skills

For deeper audits, activate the matching skill (§12) instead of expanding §5:

- **Extension audits** → `extension-review` skill · **Test coverage** → `test-coverage-review` skill
- Present report first; wait for approval before writing files.

### Refactor Mode

- No behaviour changes. Tests must pass before and after.
- Measure LOC delta. Flag if a refactor increases LOC without justification.

### Planning Mode

- Produce a task breakdown before writing code.
- Estimate complexity (S/M/L/XL). Flag anything XL for decomposition.

---

## §6 — Waste Catalogue (Muda)

Tag Review Mode findings with these codes:

W1 Overproduction · W2 Waiting · W3 Transport · W4 Over-processing · W5 Inventory · W6 Motion · W7 Defects · W8 Unused talent · W9 Prompt waste · W10 Context window waste · W11 Hallucination rework · W12 Verification overhead · W13 Prompt engineering debt · W14 Model-task mismatch · W15 Tool friction · W16 Over/under-trust

---

## §7 — Metrics

| Metric | Command | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Total LOC | `find . \( -name '*.sh' -o -name '*.md' \) -not -path './.git/*' -not -path './.github/archive/*' | xargs wc -l | tail -1` | Trending down or flat |
| Test count | `bash tests/run_simple_tests.sh` | Trending up |
| Type errors | `echo "no type check configured"` (or `get_errors` built-in) | Zero |
| Runtime deps | count from manifest | ≤ 6 |

---

## §8 — Living Update Protocol

Copilot may edit this file when patterns stabilise. Rules:

1. **Never delete** existing rules without explicit user instruction.
2. **Additive by default** — append to sections; don't restructure them.
3. **Flag before writing** — describe the change and wait for confirmation on edits to §1–§7.
4. **Self-update trigger phrases**: "Add this to your instructions", "Remember this for next time" — these add a convention to this file.
5. **Template updates**: When the user says **"Update your instructions"** (or any variant listed in the Canonical triggers table of `AGENTS.md`), this means: go to the upstream template repository at `https://github.com/asafelobotomy/copilot-instructions-template`, fetch the latest version, compare it against the installed version, and run the update protocol defined in `UPDATE.md`. This is not a request to make arbitrary edits — it is specifically a check-for-upstream-updates command.

### Attention Budget

This file is loaded into the LLM context on every interaction. To prevent instruction-following degradation from context dilution:

| Scope | Budget | Enforced by |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| **Entire file** (§1–§14) | ≤ 800 lines | CI (`ci.yml`) |
| **§5 (Operating Modes)** | ≤ 210 lines | CI (`ci.yml`) — largest section; contains all workflow modes |
| **Other §1–§9 sections** | ≤ 120 lines each | CI (`ci.yml`) |
| **§10 (Project-Specific Overrides)** | No hard limit | Grows with project — review during heartbeat |
| **§11–§14 (protocols)** | ≤ 150 lines each | CI (`ci.yml`) |

**Overflow rule**: When a section approaches its budget, extract detailed procedures into a skill file (`.github/skills/`), a path-specific instruction file (`.github/instructions/`), or a prompt file (`.github/prompts/`). Leave a one-line reference in the main section.

### Heartbeat Protocol

Event-triggered health checks that keep the agent aligned with real project state. The heartbeat checklist lives in `.copilot/workspace/operations/HEARTBEAT.md`.

**When to fire**: session start; after a medium/large task (one strong signal: 8+ modified files or 30+ minutes; or two supporting: 5+ files, 15+ minutes, context compaction); after refactor, migration, or restructure; after dependency manifest changes; after CI failure resolution; on "Check your heartbeat"; or on any custom trigger in `.copilot/workspace/operations/HEARTBEAT.md`.

**Procedure**:

1. Read `.copilot/workspace/operations/HEARTBEAT.md` — follow it strictly. Do not infer tasks from prior sessions.
2. Run every check in the Checks section. Cross-reference: `.copilot/workspace/knowledge/MEMORY.md` (consolidation), `.copilot/workspace/knowledge/TOOLS.md` (dependency audit), `.copilot/workspace/identity/SOUL.md` (reasoning alignment), and §10 (settings drift).
3. If the trigger is **explicit** and the user asked for a retrospective, call `session_reflect` MCP tool and process silently.
4. If the session is **medium/large**, call `session_reflect` when the Stop hook instructs. Medium/large = one strong signal (8+ files or 30+ minutes) or two supporting (5+ files, 15+ minutes, compaction). Skip for small tasks.
5. Update Pulse: `HEARTBEAT_OK` if all checks pass; prepend `[!]` with a one-line alert for each failure.
6. Append a row to History (keep last 5).
7. Write observations to Agent Notes for the next heartbeat.
8. Report to user only if alerts or actionable retrospective findings exist — silent when healthy.
9. **Context limit**: if context pressure is high, run `save-context.sh`, append a resume note to Agent Notes, then continue — never abandon a task mid-flight.

### Agent Hooks

Hooks are deterministic shell commands executed by VS Code at specific agent lifecycle points. Unlike instructions (soft guidance), hooks guarantee outcomes.

Hook configuration lives in `.github/hooks/copilot-hooks.json`. VS Code supports eight lifecycle events. The template wires all eight events using deterministic scripts:

| Event | Primary script(s) | Purpose |
|-------|-------------------|---------|
| `SessionStart` | `session-start.sh`, `pulse.sh --trigger session_start` | Inject project context and initialize heartbeat state |
| `UserPromptSubmit` | `pulse.sh --trigger user_prompt` | Detect explicit heartbeat and retrospective prompts |
| `PreToolUse` | `guard-destructive.sh` | Block dangerous commands; flag caution patterns for user confirmation (§3 enforcement) |
| `PostToolUse` | `post-edit-lint.sh`, `pulse.sh --trigger soft_post_tool` | Auto-format edited files and debounce heartbeat soft triggers |
| `Stop` | `scan-secrets.sh`, `pulse.sh --trigger stop` | Run secret scan and recommend retrospective only for medium/large completed tasks |
| `PreCompact` | `save-context.sh`, `pulse.sh --trigger compaction` | Preserve workspace state before context compaction |
| `SubagentStart` | `subagent-start.sh` | Inject governance context and diary summary when a subagent spawns |
| `SubagentStop` | `subagent-stop.sh` | Log subagent completion and write diary entry if durable findings exist |

Agent-scoped hooks: individual agents can define a `hooks:` section in their `.agent.md` YAML frontmatter. Agent-scoped hooks run only when that agent is active and supplement (not replace) global hooks. Enable via `chat.useCustomAgentHooks` setting.

---

## §9 — Subagent Protocol

When spawning subagents:

- The parent/default agent follows this protocol too: if a request is primarily
  specialist work, delegate to the matching agent instead of absorbing the
  specialist workflow inline.
- Each `.github/agents/*.agent.md` declares an `agents:` allow-list restricting which subagents it may invoke. Respect these boundaries.
- Keep allow-lists narrow. Add a subagent only when the agent body defines a concrete workflow for using it. Do not keep speculative delegates "just in case".
- Preferred specialist map: `Explore` for read-only repo scans, `Researcher`
  for current external docs, `Review` for formal code review or architectural
  critique, `Audit` for health, security, or residual-risk checks,
  `Extensions` for VS Code extension, profile, or workspace recommendation
  work, `Commit` for staging, commits, pushes, tags, or releases, `Setup` for
  template bootstrap, instruction update, backup restore, or factory restore
  work, and
  `Organise` for file moves, path repair, or repository reshaping.
- Pass the full contents of this file as system context.
- Set `max_depth = 3`. Stop and surface to user if reached.
- Subagent output must include: files changed, LOC delta, test result, any baseline breaches.
- Subagents inherit §3 (Structured Thinking), §11 (Tools), §12 (Skills), §13 (MCP), §14 (Spatial Layer) — all anti-loop rules apply at every depth.
- **Prompt clarity**: when spawning a subagent, the prompt must include: (a) the
  specific deliverable expected, (b) the format of the response, and (c) explicit
  stop conditions. Vague prompts cause subagent loops.
- **Fail fast**: if a subagent cannot make progress within 10 tool calls, it must
  return what it has found so far with a clear statement of what blocked it.
  Do not let subagents spin.

### Organization-Level Agents

GitHub organizations can publish shared agents via a `.github-private` repository with an `agents/` directory. These run alongside project-level agents. When both exist, project-level agents take precedence for same-name conflicts. The `organizationCustomAgents.enabled` VS Code setting must be on for org agents to load. See the **skill-management** skill for the full scope hierarchy.

### Verification Levels

The Graduated Trust Model assigns verification behaviour based on path patterns. Higher-trust paths allow Copilot to act with less friction; lower-trust paths require explicit approval.

| Trust tier | Default paths | Verification behaviour |
|-----------|--------------|----------------------|
| High | `tests/`, `__tests__/`, `*.test.*`, `*.spec.*`, `docs/`, `*.md` | Auto-approve: Copilot acts freely. Changes are summarised after the fact. |
| Standard | `src/`, `lib/`, `app/`, `packages/` | Review: Copilot describes the planned change and waits for approval before writing. |
| Guarded | `*.config.*`, `.*rc`, `.github/`, `.env*`, `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose*` | Pause: Copilot stops, explains the change in detail, and waits for explicit "go ahead" before any modification. |

> **Override rules**: *(none — all paths auto-approved)*

### Thinking Effort Configuration

Recommended thinking effort levels per agent role (set in VS Code model picker):

| Agent role | Effort | Rationale |
|------------|--------|-----------|
| Coding, Review, Research, Audit | **High** | Complex reasoning benefits from deep thinking |
| Setup, Extensions | **Medium** | Mechanical/structured tasks; adaptive reasoning sufficient |
| Fast, Explore | **Low** | Speed over depth for lookups and navigation |

> Override: open the model picker → click `>` next to the model → select effort
> level. The setting persists per model across conversations. See `MODELS.md` in
> the template repo for detailed per-agent rationale.

---

## §11 — Tool Protocol

> **Parallel execution**: When multiple independent tool calls are needed (reading N files,
> running N searches, fetching N URLs), execute all in one parallel batch. Never sequence
> independent tool calls — check for data dependencies first, then parallelize everything else.

When a task requires automation or scripting, activate the **tool-protocol** skill (`.github/skills/tool-protocol/SKILL.md`) and follow its decision tree: Find → Built-in → Search → Compose → Build → Evaluate reusability.

Key rules (always loaded):

- Tools are saved to `.copilot/tools/` with a row in `INDEX.md`
- `safe` tools run without confirmation; `destructive` tools **must pause and confirm**
- Tools must be idempotent, accept arguments (no hardcoded paths), and follow §2 LOC baselines

---

## §12 — Skill Protocol

Skills are reusable markdown-based behavioural instructions following the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) open standard. Activate the **skill-management** skill (`.github/skills/skill-management/SKILL.md`) for the full discovery and activation workflow.

Key rules (always loaded):

- Skills are loaded **on demand** — read `SKILL.md` only when its `description` matches the current task
- Priority: project (`.github/skills/`) > personal (`~/.copilot/skills/`) > agent plugins (`@agentPlugins`)
- Agent plugins (VS Code 1.110+) distribute skills alongside agents — activate the **plugin-management** skill for discovery and conflict resolution

---

## §13 — Model Context Protocol (MCP)

MCP enables Copilot to invoke external servers beyond built-in capabilities. Configuration lives in `.vscode/mcp.json`. Activate the **mcp-management** skill (`.github/skills/mcp-management/SKILL.md`) for server configuration and management.

Key rules (always loaded):

- **Sandbox stdio servers**: set `"sandboxEnabled": true` in `mcp.json` for locally-running stdio servers to restrict filesystem and network access (macOS/Linux). Sandboxed servers auto-approve tool calls.
- The MCP `memory` server has been removed — VS Code's built-in memory tool (`/memories/`) provides superior persistent storage with three scopes (user, session, repository)
- Never hardcode secrets — use `${input:}` or `${env:}` variable syntax
- **Monorepo discovery**: enable `chat.useCustomizationsInParentRepositories` to auto-discover instructions, prompts, agents, skills, and hooks from a parent Git repository root when opening a subfolder. Requires the parent folder to be trusted.
- **Troubleshooting**: if customizations fail to load, select the ellipsis (…) menu in the Chat view → *Show Agent Debug Logs* to diagnose which files were discovered and which were rejected.

---

## §14 — Spatial Layer

A shared mental model gives human and agent a common vocabulary for talking about where things live in the project.

### Vocabulary

| Term | Meaning | Maps to |
|------|---------|---------|
| Village | This project workspace | Repository root |
| Town Hall | Main instructions | `.github/copilot-instructions.md` |
| Building | Agent workspace | `.github/agents/{name}.agent.md` |
| Workshop | Template layer | `template/` |
| Trade Route | Cross-repo memory | `/memories/repo/` |
| Diary | Per-agent findings log | `.copilot/workspace/knowledge/diaries/{agent}.md` |
| Ledger | Full glossary | `.copilot/workspace/operations/ledger.md` |

> **Full glossary**: `.copilot/workspace/operations/ledger.md`. **Live status**: `spatial_status` MCP tool.

### Alignment Protocol

- **Echo before acting**: when the task is ambiguous, restate the goal in one sentence using the vocabulary above before executing. This lets the human correct misunderstandings early.
- **Surface assumptions**: if a plan depends on an assumption about the project state, name it explicitly: "I'm assuming X because Y."
- **Memory protocol**: before persisting insights — (1) check `.copilot/workspace/knowledge/MEMORY.md` for existing entries on the same topic to avoid duplicates, (2) check `.copilot/workspace/identity/SOUL.md` for reasoning patterns — add only genuinely new heuristics, (3) update `.copilot/workspace/knowledge/USER.md` only from direct observation, never inference. Use provenance: `file:line` for code, URL for docs, `session:{id}` for observed. For `/memories/repo/` entries, use the Copilot Memory schema (`subject`, `fact`, `citations`, `reason`, `category`).

### Per-Agent Diaries

Each specialist agent may record significant findings in a diary file under `.copilot/workspace/knowledge/diaries/`. Diaries are L2 (loaded on demand via SubagentStart hook, not always-loaded). Cap each diary at 30 lines; archive older entries.

- Diary files: `.copilot/workspace/knowledge/diaries/{agent-name}.md`
- Write trigger: agent discovers a durable insight worth sharing across sessions.
- Dedup: grep the diary for the finding text before writing — skip if already present.
