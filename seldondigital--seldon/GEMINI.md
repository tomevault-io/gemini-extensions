## Markdown Style

When writing or editing Markdown files:

- Use active language and straightforward descriptions.
- Avoid parentheticals, semicolons, and em dash sentences.
- Use simple grammar. Prefer short sentences. Split any sentence that carries more than one idea.
- Avoid jargon. Use terminology from `GLOSSARY.md` and do not invent new terms.
- Use one term for each concept. Do not swap between near synonyms unless `GLOSSARY.md` defines both.
- Avoid metaphors unless the glossary uses that wording. Skip casual metaphors for technical behavior.
- Avoid overly specific notation when simple wording is clearer. For example, write `a schema`, not `the one schema`.
- Prefer `Note:` and `Important:` callouts only when the reader must stop. Otherwise use a plain sentence.
- Avoid stock phrases like `source of truth`, `canonical`, and `authoritative` unless the doc states a real ownership rule.
- When explaining a data shape, show the smallest valid example before long prose or large tables.
- Prefer `X does Y` over `X is used to Y`. Prefer `Use X to Y` over `It is important to use X`. Prefer concrete subjects over vague ones like `the thing that`.
- Markdown is hand-formatted. Prettier does not format Markdown. `*.md` is listed in `.prettierignore`.
- Keep tables compact. Use a single space around cell content. Do not pad cells to align columns, because no formatter will fix them.

### Editing Existing Docs

- Match the document's existing voice and structure when you edit it. Do not impose a new style on a rewrite.
- Update the affected doc in the same change as the code. Check that examples and field names still match the code.
- When you move, rename, or delete a file or heading, update every link that points to it. Use relative links inside the repo.
- Keep one doc per topic. When you consolidate, move content into the main doc and delete the duplicate.

### Before Answering

Before giving Markdown text, check the draft for:

- Undefined jargon. Use only terms from `GLOSSARY.md`.
- Overly specific wording. Write `a property`, not `one property` or `the one property`.
- Parentheticals, semicolons, and em dash sentences. These should never be used.
- Long sentences that carry more than one idea. Write simple active sentences.
- Near synonyms for the same concept. Never use these.
- Casual metaphors or invented wording. Avoid conceptual or marketing speak.
