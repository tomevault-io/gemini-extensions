Guidance for AI agents (and humans) working in this repository.

## Project

`mod_turbotab` is a pure-Python telecom and contact-center capacity library,
exposed primarily through the `turbotab` CLI. It implements Erlang-style
queueing formulas, staffing calculations, queue metrics, and trunk sizing
helpers, with `--json` output designed for scripts and AI agents as much as
humans.

Key facts:

- Repository: `https://github.com/gstvbatista/mod_turbotab`, default branch `main`
- Runtime: Python >= 3.9, zero runtime dependencies (intentional)
- Published on PyPI as `turbotab` (`pip install turbotab`); console script
  `turbotab -> mod_turbotab.cli:main`
- The package root maps to the repo root (`package-dir` in `pyproject.toml`),
  so `import mod_turbotab` resolves from the repo's *parent* directory

## Repository map

Roadmap items are tracked as [GitHub issues labeled `roadmap`](https://github.com/gstvbatista/mod_turbotab/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Aroadmap),
not as files in this repo. Each one is a full spec following the structure in
[`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/roadmap_spec.md`](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/roadmap_spec.md)
(Problem → What It Solves → How It Works → API Surface → Complexity →
Dependencies). When picking one up, read the issue for the full
problem/approach writeup before implementing; when adding a new roadmap item,
create an issue from that template.

## Workflow

- **Branches**: code changes go through a `feat/*` (or `fix/*`, `docs/*`)
  branch merged into `main` via pull request. Committing directly to `main`
  is acceptable only for trivial docs/config touches.
- **CI**: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs the test suite on Python 3.9-3.13
  for every PR and push to `main`. The `tests` summary job is a required
  status check — PRs merge only when it's green. Merges are squash-only.
- **Review findings**: after pushing a fix for a reviewer finding (Codex or
  human), reply in that thread with what changed and the commit hash (for
  traceability), then mark the conversation as resolved and re-request
  review (`@codex review`). Don't leave addressed threads open or resolve
  them silently.
- **Commits**: use conventional commits — `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `test:`,
  `refactor:`, `chore:`.
- **External PRs**: this repository does not accept external pull requests
  (see `CONTRIBUTING.md`); they are auto-closed by
  `.github/workflows/close-prs.yml`. PRs from the repository owner are exempt.
- **Releases**: bump `version` in `pyproject.toml` in a `chore: release X.Y.Z`
  commit, then create a GitHub Release; `.github/workflows/publish.yml`
  builds and publishes to PyPI automatically via trusted publishing. PyPI
  versions are immutable — never reuse a version number.
- **Release format**: tag and title are both `vX.Y.Z`, always created with
  `--generate-notes` so the "What's Changed" PR list and Full Changelog link
  are appended below the hand-written summary:

  ```bash
  gh release create vX.Y.Z --title "vX.Y.Z" --generate-notes --notes "<summary>"
  ```

  The hand-written summary is not a one-liner — it tells the story of the
  release. MINOR (feature) releases follow this structure:

  ```markdown
  ## <Feature name>

  <2-3 paragraphs: the operational problem this solves (speak to the
  WFM/planning audience, not just developers), what shipped, how it
  behaves, and the defaults/edge cases worth knowing about.>

  ### Usage

  <CLI example with real numbers and expected output; Python example
  when the API surface is the point.>

  ### Changes

  - Added: <new functions, flags, modules>
  - Changed: <behavior changes, even compatible ones>
  - Fixed: <fixes that rode along>

  ### Compatibility

  - <breaking changes with migration notes, or "No breaking changes —
    defaults preserve previous behavior.">
  - Supported Python: 3.9-3.13

  Closes #<issue> via #<PR>
  ```

  PATCH releases use `## Fixes` with one detailed bullet per fix —
  symptom, cause, and what changed: `- <symptom>: <what was wrong and
  what changed> (#<PR>)`.
- **Versioning (semver)**: feature PRs do NOT touch `version`; the bump
  happens in a release commit on `main` right after the merge:
  - **Every merged `feat:` PR ships as its own MINOR release**
    (`0.1.0 -> 0.2.0`): merge, bump `version`, tag, GitHub Release. No
    batching — one feature, one release.
  - **PATCH** (`0.2.0 -> 0.2.1`): `fix:` merges; these may batch — cut the
    release when the fixes matter to users.
  - **`docs:`/`chore:`/`test:`-only merges never trigger a release.**
  - **MAJOR** (`x.y.z -> (x+1).0.0`): any breaking change — renamed/removed
    public function, CLI flag, or JSON output field. A `schema_version` bump
    in `cli.py` implies at least this.
  - While the project is `0.x`, a breaking change may ship as a MINOR bump
    instead of MAJOR, but must be called out prominently in the release
    notes.

## Working rules

- Keep changes scoped to the Python library/CLI surface, tests, and README
  unless the task explicitly asks for packaging, CI, or release work.
- Preserve public API and CLI flag names already documented in `README.md`
  unless a breaking-change discussion has happened first.
- Treat units carefully: call volumes are `calls_per_interval`; the default
  `interval` is `600.0` seconds, so default examples are 10-minute buckets.
- Prefer small, isolated changes. Shared formula changes can affect agents,
  queues, and trunks behavior at once — when changing one formula, inspect
  the related queue, capacity, and README documentation paths.
- Do not add third-party runtime dependencies without explicit approval.

## Code style

- Existing source uses type hints, module docstrings in Portuguese, and
  project-specific exceptions for validation/calculation failures.
- Prefer clear mathematical variable names that match the README terminology:
  `traffic_rate`, `birth_rate`, `death_rate`, `utilisation`, `sla`, `aht`,
  `interval`.
- Keep docstrings consistent with nearby code. Portuguese is acceptable and
  currently predominant in source docstrings; README and CLI help text are
  in English.
- Avoid broad refactors when fixing formulas. Make the smallest change that
  can be validated.
- README style: deep-dive content goes inside the existing `<details>`
  blocks (Mathematical model, API reference, ...), not as new top-level
  sections. Formulas belong in the Mathematical model block as ```math
  blocks using the notation table's symbols — never as inline pseudo-code
  like `A = calls * aht / interval`. New public functions get a row in the
  API reference table; CLI flags are documented by their `--help` text.

## Validation

Run the test suite from the repository root:

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests
```

For a quick manual check of a specific calculation, put the repository's
parent directory on `PYTHONPATH` (the package root maps to the repo root, so
`import mod_turbotab` resolves from one level up — the same trick
`tests/test_cli.py` uses):

```bash
PYTHONPATH=.. python3 -c "from mod_turbotab.agents.capacity import agents_required; print(agents_required(0.80, 20, 25, 180))"
# expected output: 11 (matches the README quick-start example)
```

For behavioral changes, add or update a focused test in `tests/test_cli.py`
(or a new test module) covering the changed public function or CLI command.

Before finishing, run `git status --short` and confirm only the intended
files are staged.

## Code Review Rules

- Flag any change to a formula in `calculations/`, `agents/capacity.py`,
  `queues/queues.py`, or `trunks/trunks.py` that isn't accompanied by a test
  exercising the new behavior.
- Check edge cases explicitly: zero/negative inputs, overloaded systems
  (utilisation >= 1), and Erlang A patience/abandonment behavior — these are
  the historical failure points in this kind of library.
- Verify unit consistency across a change (seconds vs. intervals, `aht` vs.
  `service_time`) since several modules share the same traffic assumptions.
- Treat the CLI's `--json` output as a public API: flag any rename, removal,
  or type change of an output field that isn't paired with a
  `schema_version` bump in `cli.py` — scripts and agents consume this
  contract.
- Flag any rewrite of the Erlang recurrences into closed-form
  factorial/power expressions: the iterative form in
  `calculations/erlang.py` exists to avoid float overflow at high server
  counts, and the textbook formula reintroduces it.
- Flag changes to the search/inversion loops in `calculations/traffic.py`
  that drop or lack an iteration cap or convergence guard — an unbounded
  `while` there can hang on non-converging inputs.
- If a CLI flag or output field is renamed or removed, confirm the README
  examples were updated to match.
- Flag any new third-party import — this project intentionally has zero
  runtime dependencies. Conversely, do not flag missing dependency pinning.
