## Design

Domain-driven design is the primary design paradigm for this project. New work
that introduces or reshapes a domain concept is modelled before it is written.

The domain model, the data model and the contracts are one first step, not
three stages. A domain model without its contracts is a description; contracts
without a model have nothing to be complete about. Define them together, before
the code, and let each correct the other.

- Bounded contexts are sized by language, not by responsibility. Splitting a
  context because two halves feel like different jobs is the usual mistake;
  if the user experiences one thing, it is one context.
- `domain` is never a package name. Packages and types are named after the
  thing they are, by what they do in this program rather than by their
  technical role. `Machine`, not `NodeManager`. Where the thing already has a
  name in the system it wraps, take that name: a tailnet node registered by
  `POST /machine/register` is a `Machine`.
- Every domain object is classified entity, value object or enumeration, and
  every field is listed. Behaviour lives on the object.
- Vendor types never appear in domain signatures. `tsnet`, `ipn` and
  `ipnstate` are confined to `internal/bridges`, which is the anti-corruption
  layer for the tailnet.

Artifacts, written before the code:

- `docs/specs/<context>-context-map.md` — ubiquitous language, contexts,
  relationships, ambiguous terms.
- `docs/specs/<context>-domain-model.md` — one section per object, with
  fields, behaviours, invariants, states and relationships.
- `docs/specs/<context>-contracts.md` — the API, the domain events and the data
  model, each to 100% and cross-checked against each other, so every aggregate
  transition can be traced through all three. A contract this project does not
  have is recorded as absent with its reason, never left blank.
- `docs/adr/NNNN-<slug>.md` — the decision and the forcing reason.

Mermaid diagrams in those files are rendered before the commit that adds them.

### Writing them

Progressive disclosure. Every document answers in its first paragraph and
deepens from there, so a reader who stops early still leaves with the decision.
Detail belongs in the spec; the ADR links to it.

An ADR is one page, Nygard's shape with the reason made explicit:

```
# NNNN. Title            <- the decision, not the topic
Status / Date
## Why?                  <- the concrete failure, never the category
## Decision              <- numbered, each one testable
## Consequences          <- what this costs, not what it wins
## Rejected              <- option, then the cost of taking it
## Revisit when          <- the condition that reopens this
```

An ADR longer than that has a spec trying to get out of it. Both are read by
someone with the code in front of them, so neither restates what the diff
already says.

Current: [Connection](docs/adr/0001-connection-bounded-context.md).

## Conventions

- Commit prefixes match the package touched: `tui:`, `bridges:`, `config:`.
- `make check` is the gate, and it is what CI runs: lint, build, then the suite
  under the race detector. `make test` is the fast loop, not the bar.

## Workflow

- Never commit to `main`. Every change gets a branch.
- Prove a bug with a failing test first: reproduce it, watch it fail, fix to
  green. No harness at that layer means adding the smallest one and wiring it
  into `make check`.
- Test through the real path before calling it fixed. Here that is the built
  binary in a terminal, not only `go test`. State what was verified and what
  could not be.
- Reply to every addressed PR comment with the commit that fixed it: backticked
  short hash, linked. No "done" without a hash.
- Commit bodies and ADRs carry the why, because the what is in the diff: the
  concrete failure, what the obvious alternative would have cost, and what
  would justify revisiting. Same for PR descriptions.
- Security-review any diff touching login links, tailnet identity, credentials
  or the bridge state directory before it merges, as a fresh-context
  adversarial pass by someone other than the author. Verify each finding; the
  build is the arbiter.
- Documents go in content-typed paths (`docs/specs/`, `docs/adr/`), never in a
  path named after whatever produced them.

## Writing the code

Least code that solves it. Before writing any, in order: does it need to exist
at all (skip it, and say so), is it already here (reuse it), does the stdlib do
it, does a dependency already in `go.mod` do it, can it be one line, and only
then the minimum new code. A new dependency has to be maintained and
license-compatible, no GPL/AGPL; name the one chosen, or why none fit.

- No abstraction nobody asked for: no interface with one implementation, no
  wrapper around a single call, no config for a value that never changes.
- Deletion over addition. Boring over clever.
- Never grow a God object. When the natural home for new state is the struct
  everything already hangs off, that is the signal to give it its own type.
  Tells: unrelated field clusters, methods that ignore most of the fields, a
  name that is a role rather than a thing, tests that cannot construct it
  without stubbing the world.
- Self-review each diff for duplication and misplaced logic before committing:
  near-identical functions, repeated literals, a second copy of a helper that
  already exists, code sitting in the wrong package.
- Nil-check where a value enters: anything off an HTTP response, parsed input,
  settings on disk or a function that can return nil is guarded at first
  receipt. A check at every use site means the guard is missing at the door.
- Handle errors where recovery is possible. Returning err to `main` moves every
  failure to the top with no context and no recovery; propagate only when the
  caller owns the decision, otherwise retry, default, wrap or degrade.
- Fix the root cause, not the path the report names. Grep every caller first:
  one guard in the shared function is a smaller diff than a guard in each.
- Slow work is a `tea.Cmd`, never inline in `Update`. Back off on retries and
  never poll the control plane or the LocalAPI in a tight loop.
- Work consciously skipped is said out loud, never left as a TODO comment or
  as speculative code.
- Unit tests and e2e tests need to be included with all new functionality. 
  Test the expected ideal behavior, not the current implementation details.

Being lazy about the solution is the goal. Being lazy about understanding it is
not: trace the flow a change touches before picking an approach, because the
smallest change in the wrong place is a second bug.
