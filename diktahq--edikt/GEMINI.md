## What This Project Is

edikt is a governance layer for agentic engineering. It enforces your coding standards, persists your architectural decisions, and makes agent behavior reproducible across every session and every engineer.

This project dogfoods itself: `.edikt/` governs edikt's own development.

## Architecture

All commands are `.md` files — no build step, no compiled code, no runtime dependencies. Rule templates live in `templates/rules/`. Configuration lives in `.edikt/config.yaml`.

**Repo structure:**
```
edikt/
├── commands/                 # 11 edikt slash commands
├── templates/
│   ├── rules/
│   │   ├── _registry.yaml   # maps rules to templates + metadata
│   │   ├── base/             # language-agnostic rules
│   │   ├── lang/             # language-specific rules

├── install.sh
└── README.md
```

## Key Invariants

- Commands are `.md` files — no compiled code, no build step
- Installation is copy files — no npm, no dependencies
- Rule templates are single `.md` per topic (not folders with individual rules)
- Three-tier rules: base (language-agnostic), lang, framework
- Claude Code only for execution reliability

## Before Implementing

1. Read ADR-001 in `docs/architecture/decisions/`
2. Read INV-001 in `docs/architecture/invariants/`
3. Read the implementation plan in `docs/plans/PLAN-edikt-v1.md`
4. Read `.edikt/project-context.md` for project identity

## Testing

Run `./test/run.sh` to validate templates, registry, and install.

## edikt

### Project
edikt is the governance layer for agentic engineering. It enforces coding standards, persists architectural decisions, and makes agent behavior reproducible across every session and every engineer.

### Before Writing Code
1. Read `docs/project-context.md` for project context
2. Rules are enforced automatically via `.claude/rules/`
3. If a plan is active, read it in `docs/plans/` — check progress table for current state
4. If a spec exists, read it in `docs/product/specs/` — the spec and its artifacts are the engineering blueprint
5. All paths are configurable in `.edikt/config.yaml` under `paths:`

### Build & Test Commands
```
# Test
./test/run.sh

# Install (global)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/diktahq/edikt/main/install.sh | bash
```

### After Compaction
If context was compacted, the PostCompact hook will re-inject the active plan phase and invariants automatically. If you need full context, run `/edikt:context`.
