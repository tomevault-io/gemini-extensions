# Vaillant eBUS Project

## Scope

- This repository contains a Home Assistant custom integration for Vaillant heat pumps.
- The integration connects directly to the local ebusd TCP interface on port `8888`; it does not use MQTT or cloud services.
- Registers and devices are discovered from ebusd at runtime. The project is intended as a drop-in replacement for `mypyllant-component`.

## Architecture

- `custom_components/vaillant_ebus/coordinator.py` owns connection lifecycle, discovery, polling, caching, and runtime register definitions.
- `custom_components/vaillant_ebus/backend/ebus_service.py` provides the ebusd transport and handles register reads and writes (writes are verified by read-back).
- `backend/entity_factory.py` maps the discovered graph to Home Assistant entity descriptions.
- `backend/mapping.py` contains register metadata such as names, icons, units, and limits.
- Platform modules in `custom_components/vaillant_ebus/` expose the generated entities to Home Assistant.

## Discovery And Entities

- The discovery graph is the source of truth for entity existence. Do not hardcode device types, circuit lists, or register lists in entity platforms.
- `REGISTER_MAP` supplies metadata and enabled defaults. It must not cause `EntityFactoryService` to create entities that are absent from the discovery graph.
- The coordinator may explicitly read enabled `REGISTER_MAP` entries as a fallback and must regenerate entity descriptions when that adds registers.
- `CIRCUIT_NAMES` is the only place for hardcoded circuit-to-label descriptions used by the Home Assistant UI.
- Values such as `-`, `no data stored`, and `empty` represent unavailable ebusd data. They must not be exposed as normal sensor values.
- Keep filtering for unsupported circuits, secondary zones, broadcast registers, and no-data devices consistent with the existing discovery and entity-factory logic. Do not create virtual entities for unsupported hardware.

## Runtime-Defined Registers

Some supported registers are not returned by ebusd `find` and must be defined or probed at runtime. `ctlv2.z1RoomHumidity` and `hmu.SourceTempInput` are confirmed examples, not an exhaustive list. `SourceTempInput`'s layout is verified upstream on brine units (john30/ebusd-configuration PR #565); on air/water units the B51A reply is a 3-byte stub, so the read fails and the register correctly stays unavailable.

When functionality is missing, inspect the raw `find` output, discovery dump, ebusd metadata, and unmapped registers before adding a one-off implementation. Test each candidate directly against ebusd, confirm its message format and read-back value, and add only registers supported by the connected hardware.

Keep all runtime definitions in `VaillantCoordinator._define_custom_registers()` and execute them after connecting to ebusd and before discovery. Use one data-driven collection for additional definitions instead of separate register-specific code paths.

The confirmed `z1RoomHumidity` definition is:

```text
r5,ctlv2,z1RoomHumidity,z1RoomHumidity,31,15,B524,020003002800,value,,IGN:4,,,,value,,EXP,,%,z1 Room Humidity
```

Use `EbusService.define_register()` for runtime definitions. Do not replace them with CSV uploads or an addon `--configpath` override.

When changing `_fallback_read()`, preserve entity regeneration after newly readable registers are added.

## Climate Compatibility

Climate behavior must follow the corresponding `mypyllant` implementation.

- In `day` / manual mode, `async_set_temperature` writes `Z1DayTemp` directly.
- In time-controlled modes, it uses quick veto with `Z1QuickVetoTemp` and `Z1QuickVetoDuration`.
- If quick veto is already active in a time-controlled mode, update its temperature without writing a new duration.
- Preset mapping, HVAC modes, and climate services should remain aligned with `mypyllant`.

## ebusd Safety

- Never modify, upload, or delete ebusd addon CSV files.
- Never set the ebusd addon `--configpath`.
- Before changing integration code for a register write, test the register directly against ebusd over TCP or HTTP, verify a `done` response, and read the value back.
- Treat registers that return `ERR: element not found` or `no data stored` as unsupported or temporarily unavailable; do not fabricate values or entities.

## Discovering Registers Absent From CSV

The installed ebusd CSV files only cover what `find` returns. The bus carries more
telegrams; capture them with `grab` and mine the unknown ones for new registers.

- Live grab: `grab` → wait N seconds → `grab result all` → `grab stop`. Do **not**
  use `grab -m ...` (invalid syntax). A grab that runs while the user changes a
  setting in the myVaillant app shows the write telegram that carries the new
  register (app → cloud → NETX2 → bus).
- Unknown telegrams have no register label after the count: `.../ 09410111... = 3`.
  Labeled ones look like `... = 19: hmu SetMode`. Parse them with
  `backend/grab_parser.py` (`parse_grab_lines`, `unknown_telegrams`).
- Dumps capture them as `unknown_telegrams` (and `labeled_telegrams`) next to the
  raw `grab` lines. When a dump exists, prefer mining its `unknown_telegrams` over
  a fresh grab.
- Register candidates found this way must be verified against ebusd (message format,
  read-back value) before adding a `define -r` to `_define_custom_registers()`.
- **Live-verificatie geldt alleen voor de eigen hardware.** Eén grabbage op de eigen
  bus is live testbaar. Data afkomstig van anderen (dumps, gists, issue snippets,
  upstream threads) is **nooit** live testbaar — behandel die als community-data (zie
  "Community Data" hieronder), niet als eigen-live-verificatie.

## Upstream Issues/PRs as a Register Source

The shipped CSVs in `john30/ebusd-configuration` and the compiled CDN copies run far
behind the bus (see `john30/ebusd-configuration#632`). Do **not** expect unknown
register definitions, field layouts, or message IDs to exist in the `.tsp`/CSV source.
The working knowledge lives in that repo's **issues and pull requests** — people post
CSV snippets, `define` strings, `find` output, and per-hardware field layouts there.

- Search issues and PRs with `tools/search_upstream.sh`, which wraps `gh search`
  against `john30/ebusd-configuration`:
  - `tools/search_upstream.sh "PrEnergySum"` — issues matching title/body.
  - `tools/search_upstream.sh --comments "YieldHwcDay"` — also match comment bodies
    (most CSV snippets and layouts are pasted in comments).
  - `tools/search_upstream.sh --all "SourceTempInput"` — issues and PRs.
  - `tools/search_upstream.sh "query" "john30/ebusd"` — search another repo.
- The ebusd-configuration repo has discussions **disabled**; search issues and PRs only.
- When a promising thread is found, open it (`gh issue view <n> --comments`) and read
  the full conversation before trusting a snippet. Prefer definitions that the reporter
  verified against a live device.
- Never modify or upload ebusd CSV files and never set `--configpath`; that is addon-side.

## Community Data (user/upstream dumps)

Data from users and upstream threads (discovery dumps, gists, `find` output, CSV or
`define` snippets) can **never** be live-tested — the hardware is not ours. That does
not mean the data stays out of the code; it means we adopt it conservatively so the
integration keeps working for every other setup.

When adding registers, devices, or metadata derived from community data:

- Add the capture as a fixture under `tests/fixtures/community/` and drive the new code
  from that fixture (see "Test Fixtures"). The fixture replaces live verification as the
  correctness gate.
- Add the entity/register through the existing data-driven paths (`REGISTER_MAP`,
  `MULTI_FIELD_FIELDS`, `_define_custom_registers()`, device-type tables) so it is
  covered by the same discovery/entity-factory logic as everything else. Do not bolt on
  one-off register-specific code paths.
- Keep changes additive and opt-in: enabling a community register/device must not change
  behavior for hardware that does not expose it, and must not crash discovery or entity
  generation when the register is absent.
- Prefer conservative metadata: only map layouts and read-back values that are explicit
  in the capture. Do not fabricate field layouts from a single untested snippet.
- Add a regression test that loads the fixture and asserts the expected register/entity
  appears on the discovered device graph without error.
- If the data is incomplete or ambiguous, prefer a discovery-only or YAML-override
  approach over a hardcoded production path, and flag the uncertainty to the owner
  rather than guessing in code.

## Known Limitations

- Many heat-pump registers return `no data stored` while the compressor is idle.
- Register classification is inferred from discovery and metadata; YAML overrides may be needed for uncommon registers.
- Some useful registers may require runtime definitions before they can be discovered.

## Test Fixtures

- ebusd `find` output and discovery dumps are captured as fixtures in `tests/fixtures/`. There is no `data-dump/` directory anymore; all community and local captures live in `tests/fixtures/`.
- `tests/fixtures/community/` holds third-party captures: discovery-dump YAML files (`flexotherm_discovery.yaml`, `arotherm_plus_2zone_discovery.yaml`, `arotherm_plus_basv3_discovery.yaml`, `arotherm_pro7_discovery.yaml`, `geniaset_bass3_discovery.yaml`) and plain `find` output (`basv_find.txt`, `v32_find.txt`, `flexocompact_find.txt`, `szflo_ebusctl_info.txt`, `second_ebusctl_info.txt`, `dumpvalues.yaml`).
- `dumpvalues.yaml` records multi-field register field names and is the reference for `MULTI_FIELD_MAP` in `tests/fake_ebusd.py`. Keep the two in sync.
- Load fixtures in tests with `load_find_lines("community/<name>")` for `find` output and `load_discovery_dump("community/<name>")` for discovery-dump YAML; both live in `tests/fake_ebusd.py`. Discovery-dump YAML fixtures need `pyyaml` (installed in CI).
- Open GitHub issues may reference specific community dumps. When investigating an issue, load the matching fixture and confirm the register behavior on the discovered device graph before changing production code.
- New community captures should be added under `tests/fixtures/community/` as discovery-dump YAML (preferred, keeps metadata and `raw_find_lines`) with a fixture-load test, never as a separate `data-dump/` folder.
- **Fixtures are the correctness gate for community data.** A fixture-driven regression test replaces live ebusd verification for anything derived from user/upstream captures. Prefer this over asking for live access; only the owner's own hardware can ever be live-verified.

## Validation

```bash
.venv/bin/ruff check .
.venv/bin/pytest -q
python3 -m compileall -f custom_components/vaillant_ebus/
```

## GitHub Communication

- Write GitHub issue, discussion, and pull request replies in clear English.
- Use clean Markdown with complete sentences, correct punctuation, and blank lines between paragraphs.
- Put lists and distinct points on separate lines. Never post compressed, run-on, or caveman-style prose.
