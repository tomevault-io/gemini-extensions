## 1. Project Identity & Purpose
- **Core Stack**: Node.js, Express 4.18.2 (backend), vanilla HTML/CSS/JS + Web Bluetooth API (frontend)
- **Primary Objective**: Web-based darts scoring app for a DARTSLIVE Home dlb0003 dartboard, connecting via Web Bluetooth. Includes a small Express server for a shared, disk-persisted leaderboard across devices on the LAN, plus optional Home Assistant/WLED LED-ring integration tied to game state.
- **Entry Points**: `server.js` (`npm start` — Express app + static file serving), `ble-scanner.html` (standalone Phase 1 BLE discovery tool), `index.html` / `darts-scorer.html` (main scoring app)

## 2. Architecture & Dependencies
- **Internal Modules**:
  - `server.js` — Express server, `/api/*` routes, serves leaderboard history and triggers HA scripts
  - `scorer.js` — client-side game logic (01 and Cricket)
  - `ble.js` — Web Bluetooth driver + dart segment byte decoder (Nordic UART service `6e400001-...`, char `6e40fff6-...`)
  - `add-game.js` / `remove-player.js` — utility scripts
  - `data/` — `history.json`, persisted leaderboard state (gitignored)
  - `certs/` — `cert.pem` / `key.pem` (do not read/print contents — TLS material)
- **Key External APIs / Services**: Home Assistant REST API (optional — activates WLED presets on a dartboard LED ring via HA scripts); Web Bluetooth (browser-native, no server-side dependency)
- **Environment Variables Required**: `HA_BASE_URL`, `HA_TOKEN`, `HA_SCRIPT_GAME_ON`, `HA_SCRIPT_GAME_OFF`, `HA_SCRIPT_WINNER` (all optional — app runs fine with none set; see `.env.example`)

## 3. Build, Test, & Execution Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run local dev/test server
npm start
# Open http://localhost:3180 (or http://<lan-ip>:3180) in Chrome/Chromium

# Execute test suite
# No automated test suite exists in this project.
```

## 4. Current State & Known Technical Debt
 * **Status**: Functional — runs as a persistent Windows service.
 * **Known Technical Debt / Bugs**:
   * [ ] No automated test suite.
   * [ ] The legacy static-file serving path (`python3 -m http.server`) silently drops the shared leaderboard and LED integration (no `/api/*` routes) — falls back to browser `localStorage` with no warning; can look like a data-loss bug if someone serves it this way by habit.
 * **Key Constraints**:
   * The production Windows Service is hosted by **`C:\ClaudeCentral\tools\nssm\nssm.exe`**, a path *outside this repo*. Service config: `AppDirectory=C:\ai\dartslive-scorer`, `Application=C:\Program Files\nodejs\node.exe`, `AppParameters=server.js`. If `C:\ClaudeCentral` is ever cleaned up, that `tools\nssm` subfolder must be preserved (or the service migrated to a new NSSM install) or the service loses its host process.
   * `.env` holds a Home Assistant long-lived access token — never commit it; it's already gitignored.

## 6. Security & Runtime Audit (2026-08-02)
- **Credential sweep (working tree)**: no credential-name literal hits found. `certs/cert.pem` and `certs/key.pem` (TLS material) confirmed gitignored — tracked: no, pushed: no, in-history-only: no.
- **Git history check**: `git log --all --oneline -- .env`, `-- certs/cert.pem`, `-- certs/key.pem` each returned no commits — none were ever tracked. Repo-wide sweep for added files matching `.env|secret|password|credential|\.pem` across all history found only `.env.example` (placeholder template, expected/safe).
- **Runtime status**: A `node` process (PID 15184) listens on ports 3180/3181, matching this project's documented port. Identified as Windows Service **`dartslive-scorer`** (DisplayName "Dartslive Scorer"), state RUNNING, hosted via NSSM (`C:\ClaudeCentral\tools\nssm\nssm.exe`) with `Application=C:\Program Files\nodejs\node.exe`, `AppParameters=server.js`, `AppDirectory=C:\ai\dartslive-scorer` — consistent with the NSSM config already documented in Section 4. Healthy, correctly correlated.
- **Gitignored-but-present directories**: `.env` (378 bytes, not tracked), `certs/` (2.9K, not tracked), `data/` (3.4K, leaderboard history), `node_modules/` (2.3M). No size or content concerns.
- **`C:\ClaudeCentral` cleanup confirmation (2026-08-02, follow-up)**: verified `C:\ClaudeCentral\` currently contains exactly two things — `dartslive-scorer\` (a full 4.4 MB old copy of this project, own `.git`, own `.env`, `node_modules/` — **superseded**, the live NSSM service's `AppDirectory` is confirmed `C:\ai\dartslive-scorer`, not this old copy) and `tools\` (`migrate-stage1.ps1`, `verify-persistence.ps1`, and `tools\nssm\` — **must be kept**, `nssm.exe` here is confirmed to be actively hosting the running `dartslive-scorer` Windows service right now, `nssm.exe status dartslive-scorer` returned `SERVICE_RUNNING`). Net: `C:\ClaudeCentral\dartslive-scorer\` is safe to remove once someone's satisfied nothing else references it (its own `.env` should be checked/rotated-if-needed before deletion, same as any other credential file, rather than assumed harmless because it's "just a duplicate"); `C:\ClaudeCentral\tools\nssm\` must NOT be removed — the live service depends on it.

## 7. Session Log (Mandatory Agent Updates)
*Format: [YYYY-MM-DD] [Agent Name/Model] - Summary of changes made*
 * [2026-08-02] [Setup-Agent] - Migrated legacy benchmark/context docs to consolidated AGENTS.md format.
 * [2026-08-02] [Audit-Agent] - Ran security/runtime audit: confirmed `.env`/certs never committed (working tree + full git history), correlated the NSSM-hosted `dartslive-scorer` service with the process on ports 3180/3181, reviewed gitignored dirs. No issues found; see Section 6.
