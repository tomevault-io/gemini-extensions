# red-run

Claude Code skill library for penetration testing and CTF work.

## Engagement Workflow

The orchestrator is invoked via `/red-run-ctf` slash command only — not by
natural language triggers. It contains all routing logic, approval gates,
and state management rules. **If you are a teammate** (spawned by a team
lead), **do NOT invoke the orchestrator skill.** Load technique skills via
`mcp__skill-router__get_skill()` instead — never via the Skill tool.

## Token Budget

Every token costs money and latency. Consider token impact when making ANY
change — agent templates, skill text, MCP responses, orchestrator prompts.
Prefer designs that minimize per-invocation token usage without sacrificing
needed functionality. Put hints in tool responses (loaded only when called)
rather than agent templates (loaded every invocation).

**No inline file templates.** Never embed file contents (YAML, shell scripts,
JSON, config files) directly in skill files, agent templates, or orchestrator
prompts. Store templates in `operator/templates/` and reference them by path.

## Architecture

### Orchestrator Variants

| Variant | Status | Execution Model |
|---------|--------|-----------------|
| `/red-run-ctf` | **Active** (default) | Agent teams — persistent teammates, peer messaging |
| `/red-run-legacy` | **Legacy** | Subagents — ephemeral, one skill per invocation |
| `/red-run-notouch` | Planned | DLP-safe — operator runs commands, reports sanitized output |
| `/red-run-train` | Planned | Training mode — guided walkthrough with explanations |

All variants share state.db, MCP servers, and technique skills. An engagement
started with one can be resumed with another. Invoke via slash command only.

### Agent Teams (`/red-run-ctf`)

The lead session runs the orchestrator skill, creates a team via `TeamCreate`,
spawns persistent domain teammates via `Agent` with `team_name`, assigns tasks
via `TaskCreate`/`TaskUpdate`, and chains vulnerabilities toward impact.
Teammates communicate via `SendMessage` and write to state.db through
state-mgr. All technique skills (67+) are served on-demand via the MCP
skill-router. Teammate spawn templates live in `teammates/`.

### MCP Servers

| Server | Location | Purpose |
|--------|----------|---------|
| skill-router | `tools/skill-router/` | Semantic skill discovery and loading (ChromaDB + embeddings) |
| nmap-server | `tools/nmap-server/` | Dockerized nmap scanning with input validation |
| shell-server | `tools/shell-server/` | TCP listener, reverse shell, local interactive process manager |
| state | `tools/state-server/` | Full read/write engagement state (SQLite) |
| browser-server | `tools/browser-server/` | Headless browser automation |
| rdp-server | `tools/rdp-server/` | Headless RDP automation via aardwolf |
| sliver-server | `tools/sliver-server/` | Sliver C2 gRPC wrapper (optional) |
| state-viewer | `operator/state-viewer/` | Read-only web dashboard for state.db (not MCP) |

In agent teams mode, **state-mgr** is the sole writer to state.db (LLM-level
dedup + graph coherence). **shell-mgr** owns shell lifecycle (listeners,
processes, upgrades) — teammates message shell-mgr for setup, then interact
with the MCP directly after session handoff. See each server's `README.md`.

## Skill Routing

The orchestrator makes every routing decision. Skills report findings
generically — they do not name next skills. The orchestrator calls
`search_skills(query)` to find technique skills, then spawns/messages the
appropriate teammate.

**Mandatory skill loading**: Never execute a technique without loading the
matching skill via `get_skill()`. Skills contain methodology, payloads, and
troubleshooting that general knowledge does not.

**Built-in sub-agents** (Explore, Plan, general-purpose) do NOT have MCP
access — use them only for local processing, never for target-level work.

## State Management

Engagement state lives in `engagement/state.db` (SQLite, managed by
state-server MCP). Tables: targets, ports, credentials, credential_access,
access, vulns, pivot_map, blocked, tunnels, state_events.

- `get_state_summary()` produces a compact markdown summary for consumption
- Teammates read state directly; all writes go through state-mgr
- The orchestrator polls `poll_events()` for real-time visibility
- Orchestrator uses state summary + pivot map to chain vulns toward impact

## Teammate Protocol

This section applies to all domain teammates spawned during engagements.
Infrastructure teammates (state-mgr, shell-mgr) have their own protocols
defined in their templates.

### Task Workflow

1. The lead assigns a task via `SendMessage` starting with `[TASK]`,
   including: skill name, target, and context.
2. Load the skill via `mcp__skill-router__get_skill(name="<skill-name>")`
   — call it directly, not via a subagent. If not callable yet, run
   `ToolSearch("select:mcp__skill-router__get_skill")` first. The full
   skill text MUST be in YOUR context window. **Never use the Agent tool
   or Skill tool to load skills.**
3. Execute the skill's methodology end-to-end.
4. Message state-mgr with findings using `[action]` protocol.
5. Message the lead with a structured summary.
6. Mark the task complete. **Wait for next assignment — never self-claim.**

### State Writes via state-mgr

All state writes go through state-mgr. **Do NOT call state write tools
directly** — they are callable but MUST NOT be used. Send structured messages:

```
[add-port] ip=<ip> port=<N> proto=tcp service=<svc>
[add-target] ip=<ip> hostname=<host> os="<os>"
[update-target] ip=<ip> hostname=<host> notes="<notes>"
[add-vuln] ip=<ip> title="<title>" vuln_type=<type> severity=<sev> via_access_id=<N> details="<details>"
[add-cred] username=<user> secret=<secret> secret_type=<type> source="<source>" via_access_id=<N> via_vuln_id=<M>
[add-access] ip=<ip> method=<method> user=<user> level=<level> via_credential_id=<N> via_vuln_id=<V>
[add-blocked] ip=<ip> technique="<name>" reason="<why>" retry=<no|later|with_context>
[add-pivot] from_ip=<ip> to_subnet=<cidr> pivot_type="<type>"
[update-vuln] id=<N> status=actioned details="<details>"
```

Batch multiple writes in one message. Wait for confirmation IDs before
referencing them in later messages.

**SendMessage requires a `summary` field** (5-10 word preview) with every
message to any teammate.

### Tool Execution

**Bash is the default** for CLI tools — use `dangerouslyDisableSandbox: true`
for network commands. Don't run `which` for Docker-only tools.

**Stay responsive — run long commands in background.** Any command over ~30
seconds: redirect stdout/stderr to `engagement/evidence/`, use
`run_in_background: true`, then use the **Read tool** on the output file
when notified. Do NOT use TaskOutput. Blocking your turn prevents the lead
from messaging you to redirect or abort.

### Operational Rules

- `date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'` for real timestamps — never placeholders
- `curl --connect-timeout 5 --max-time 15` always
- **Never download/clone/install tools.** Missing tool → stop, report, return.
- **Never modify /etc/hosts.** If a hostname doesn't resolve, stop all work
  that depends on it, message the lead with hostname and IP, and wait.
- **Never write custom scripts** to interact with remote services. Use
  installed CLI tools and MCP servers. If a tool fails, report — don't reinvent.
- MCP names: hyphens for servers (`mcp__shell-server__`), underscores for
  tools (`add_vuln`)

### Stall Detection

5+ tool rounds on the same failure with no new info → stop immediately.
Return: what was attempted, what failed, assessment (blocked/retry-later).

### Activation Protocol

On activation (this runs once, before any task):
1. `ToolSearch("select:TaskUpdate,TaskList,TaskGet")` — preload task schemas
2. `get_state_summary()` — load engagement state
3. Go idle. Your first task arrives as a `SendMessage` starting with `[TASK]`.

### Target Knowledge Ethics

Never use specific knowledge of the current target (CTF writeups,
walkthroughs). Follow the skill methodology as if you've never seen this
target before.

## Engagement Directory

Created by the orchestrator at engagement start:

```
engagement/
  config.yaml       # Operator preferences (scan, proxy, spray, cracking, callback)
  scope.md          # Target scope, credentials, rules of engagement
  state.db          # SQLite state (managed via state-server MCP)
  dump-state.sh     # Export state.db as markdown
  evidence/         # Saved output, responses, dumps
    logs/           # Teammate JSONL transcripts
```

## Skill File Format

Every skill lives at `skills/<category>/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`.

### Frontmatter (required)

```yaml
---
name: skill-name
description: >
  What it does. When to trigger. Negative conditions (when NOT to use).
keywords:
  - technique-specific search terms
  - tool names, CVE IDs, protocol names
tools:
  - tool1
  - tool2
opsec: low|medium|high
---
```

### Body structure

1. **Preamble**: "You are helping a penetration tester with..."
2. **Engagement Logging**: Check for engagement dir, save evidence
3. **State Management**: Read via `get_state_summary()`, report findings
4. **Prerequisites**: Access, tools, conditions
5. **Steps**: Assess → Confirm → Exploit → Escalate/Pivot
6. **Troubleshooting**: Common failures and fixes

### Conventions

- Skill names use kebab-case: `sql-injection-union`, `kerberoasting`
- One technique per skill — split broad topics into focused skills
- Embed critical payloads directly (top 2-3 per variant for 80% coverage)
- OPSEC in description: `low` = passive, `medium` = artifacts, `high` = noisy
- New skills need descriptive frontmatter so `search_skills()` can discover them

## Permission Mode

Agent teams works in standard permission mode. MCP server tools are
pre-allowed in `.claude/settings.json`. The orchestrator's approval gates
provide human-in-the-loop control.

## Installation

```bash
./install.sh          # Symlinks — edits in repo reflect immediately
./install.sh --copy   # Copies — for machines without the repo
./uninstall.sh        # Remove everything
```

Requires [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), Docker (for nmap), and
Playwright (for browser automation — Chromium installed automatically).
