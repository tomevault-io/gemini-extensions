# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project overview

Go CLI tool for podcast audio preprocessing using embedded FFmpeg. Transforms raw voice recordings into broadcast-ready audio at -16 LUFS through a four-pass adaptive processing pipeline. Uses the [Charm v2 suite](https://charm.land) for the TUI (bubbletea + lipgloss under the `charm.land/<pkg>/v2` import domain).

## Setup commands

- Enter development shell: `nix develop` (or let direnv activate automatically)
- Initialise ffmpeg-statigo submodule and download libraries: `just setup` (fetches latest release tag, updates submodule, runs download-lib automatically)

## Build and test commands

- **Build binary:** `just build` (never use `go build` directly - requires CGO + version injection)
- **Run tests:** `just test`
- **Run linters:** `just lint` (runs `gocyclo`, `ineffassign`, `golangci-lint` including `govet`, and `actionlint`)
- **Clean artifacts:** `just clean`
- **Install to ~/.local/bin:** `just install`
- **VHS demo recording:** `just vhs`

```

**Data flow (processing):** `main.go` resolves worker count via `resolveJobs()` (number of input files, capped at `NumCPU`, floored at 1; no flag), creates a cancellable `ctx`, then launches `runWorkerPool()` (`pool.go`) → up to `jobs` files run concurrently, each a goroutine bounded by a semaphore, taking a `CloneForWorker()` config copy and `FileIndex`-routed TUI messages → `ProcessAudio(ctx, …)` → Pass 1 (`AnalyseAudio`) → `AdaptConfig()` → Pass 2 (filter chain) → Pass 3/4 (`ApplyNormalisation`) → `report.WriteMarkdownReport()` renders an always-on Markdown report (`<name>-LUFS-NN-processed.md`) from the run's `RunRecord` → sends `ui.*Msg` to TUI via `tea.Program.Send()`. After `WaitGroup` drains, the pool sends `ui.AllCompleteMsg`. `cancel()` fires after `p.Run()` returns; `runFilterGraph` checks `ctx.Err()` each frame so in-flight workers abort and run deferred temp cleanup. `runWorkerPool` returns the count of per-file failures (errors wrapping `context.Canceled` are excluded); `launchWorkerPool`'s done channel is a buffered `chan int` carrying that count to `main.go`, which exits 1 when it is nonzero. Cancellation (`q` or `Ctrl+C`) exits 0; report, run-record, sidecar, and spectrogram write failures stay warnings and never affect the exit code.

With `--diagnostics`, each worker attaches the deterministic before/after PNG path list to the `RunRecord` synchronously (`DeriveSpectrogramImages`, pure string work) **before** the `.md`/`.json` write, so the report carries resolving image links; the actual `showspectrumpic` renders run in **bounded background goroutines** off the critical path (`RenderSpectrogramImage`), sharing the pool's semaphore budget and tracked by a `sync.WaitGroup` that gates program exit. Renders honour `ctx` (abort + remove partial PNGs on cancellation) and are non-fatal (a failed render surfaces a warning; audio/`.json`/`.md` still land). The flag touches no DSP, so the `.flac` output is byte-identical with it on or off.

**Data flow (analysis-only):** `main.go` → `runAnalysisOnly()` → `runAnalysisOnlyWithDeps()` (passes `jobs` from `resolveJobs()`) → spawns `runAnalysisPool()` (`analysispool.go`) with a buffered semaphore of size `jobs` and a `sync.WaitGroup`. Up to `jobs` files analyse concurrently; each worker owns its index slot in pre-allocated `results`, `metas`, and `errs` slices (no sharing), calls `CloneForWorker()` for an independent config copy, and sends `ui.AnalysisStartMsg` / `ui.AnalysisProgressMsg` / `ui.AnalysisCompleteMsg` keyed by `FileIndex`. After `wg.Wait()` drains, the pool sends `ui.AllCompleteMsg`. Two branches: TTY path launches a `tea.Program` (using `ui.NewAnalysisModel`) in a goroutine alongside the pool; no-TTY path prints an up-front banner then calls the pool synchronously with `p == nil` (all `p.Send` calls are gated). After the pool returns, `runAnalysisOnlyWithDeps()` prints results in input order, skipping cancelled or nil slots, and `report.WriteMarkdownReport()` writes an `<input>-analysis.md` report (path from `report.AnalysisReportPath`) per file from the Pass-1-only `RunRecord`. With `--diagnostics`, an input-only PNG list (no "after" stage; no output file exists) is derived synchronously onto the record and rendered under the same bounded-semaphore / `WaitGroup` / `ctx` discipline as processing. The TUI (`renderAnalysisVerdict` in `analysis_model.go`) and no-TTY console (`printAnalysisConfirmation` in `main.go`) each show the Recording stars (`ComputeRecordingScore`) plus a gain-advice line (`GainAdvice` + the 5-cell `ui.GainBar` thermometer); both are display-only and the `.md` report stays verdict-free. No processed audio is produced. `runAnalysisOnlyWithDeps()` returns the count of files whose analysis failed with a real (non-cancellation) error; `main.go` exits 1 when it is nonzero.

## Audio processing pipeline

> Plain-language how-and-why of the pipeline (for engineers and creators) lives in `docs/Pipeline.md`. This section is the developer/agent spec: pass order, filter chain, and the exact stage parameters.

**Four-pass architecture:**

1. **Pass 1 (Analysis):** Measures LUFS, true peak, LRA, noise floor, spectral characteristics; a unified voice-activity detector (`detectVoiceActivity` in `analyser_vad.go`) splits the per-250ms interval level histogram with Otsu's method, elects the `SpeechProfile` (hysteresis-built runs, adaptive gap-tolerance, spectral veto) and the `NoiseProfile` (longest below-split run) from that one split, and sets the noise floor from a low percentile of the level set (this overwrites the astats-seeded `Noise.Floor`/`NoiseProfile.MeasuredNoiseFloor` with a momentary-LUFS value, see `## Measurement axes`); `deriveGateStatistics` also derives the gate-window statistics from the same split and axis (`VoicedLowPercentile` = voiced p10, `NoiseHighPercentile` = noise p95, `GateSeparationDB` = their difference), exposed in the run-record JSON under `regions.gate_statistics` and in the report. After the main decode loop, speech bands (2) and noise bands (15) run through `runBandMeasurements` behind the shared `bandMeasureSem` (`runtime.NumCPU()`). `measureNoiseBands` skips its 15 decodes and drains progress when custom afftdn cannot be selected. Each measured band opens its own reader and writes only its own slot, so measured RMS values are bit-identical to the former serial path and a per-band failure isolates to a zero/non-measured slot instead of failing the whole measurement. Pass 1 progress reserves 0.0..0.95 for the decode loop (`BandPhaseProgressStart`) and 0.95..1.0 for the band phase, emitting a serialised `ProgressUpdate` per completed band under the `Analysing frequency bands` phase (no-TTY passes a nil callback, so the tracker no-ops)
2. **Pass 2 (Processing):** Applies adaptive filter chain tuned to measurements; output measured for before/after comparison
3. **Pass 3 (Measuring):** Optionally prepends `volume` (pre-gain) + `alimiter` (levelling limiter) when limiting is active, then runs loudnorm in measurement mode (JSON written to a per-call `stats_file`, read back after graph free) to get input stats for linear mode; measures the post-limiter signal so `measured_I`/`measured_TP` are accurate
4. **Pass 4 (Normalising):** Applies `volume` (pre-gain, when ceiling clamped) + `alimiter` (levelling limiter) + `loudnorm` (linear mode) + `aresample` (source rate) + `adeclick` + `alimiter` (final-stage brickwall); pre-gain raises very quiet recordings so the alimiter can use a viable ceiling; the prefix `alimiter` creates headroom so loudnorm achieves full linear gain to reach -16 LUFS; ceiling is derived as `targetTP − gainRequired`; loudnorm targets its own per-file internal TP (`loudnormInternalTargetTP` = projected post-gain peak + `linearSafetyMargin` + `measurementCushionDB`, with the emitted `TP=` clamped to FFmpeg's `[-9, 0]` range), while the final-stage brickwall `alimiter` (pinned to `targetTP − brickwallTruePeakHeadroomDB`) owns true-peak delivery; output lands at the canonical -16 LUFS / -1 dBTP. `linearSafetyMargin = 0.1` (numeric Go-vs-FFmpeg agreement) and `measurementCushionDB = 0.2` (Go-vs-FFmpeg measurement disagreement) are the only static loudnorm-internal margins; the per-file derivation makes the linear-mode cap in `calculateLinearModeTarget` inert by construction, so every file reaches full -16 LUFS in linear mode

**Filter chain order (Pass 2):**
```
downmix → rumble_highpass → bandlimit_lowpass → noise_reduction (anlmdn at source rate, r=0.0020, m=3 → afftdn FFT spectral denoise, fixed nr=12, adaptive enable + nf + measured custom band-noise shape) → speech_gate → levelling_compressor → deesser → analysis → resample
```

Order rationale: downmix to mono first; HP/LP removes frequency extremes before gate (the high-pass/low-pass side-chain pattern); denoising before gating (lowers noise floor for gate); compression before de-essing (compression emphasises sibilance); analysis measures processed signal; final resample standardises output format last.

**Noise removal default:** Production runs `anlmdn → afftdn`. `anlmdn` runs at the source sample rate with `r=0.0020` (`r_min`) and `m=3` (`m_strict`); `afftdn` (FFT spectral denoise, default `nr=12:nt=w:tn=1`; `tn`, `nf`, and `nt` adapt, see below) follows as the residual-suppression stage. No sample-rate cap or exit restore - downstream filters (gate, levelling compressor, de-esser, analysis) operate at the source rate throughout. The matrix spike at `.bench/anlmdn-matrix-spike` validated the anlmdn path against the previous 32 kHz cap default (`r=0.0045`, `m=11`) at ~35 % faster Pass 2 with metric-equivalent quality; in that context the 0.3.1 historical path is `anlmdn_legacy_default`. afftdn replaced the former `compand` residual-suppression stage: sweeps at `.bench/noiseblock-ep83` and `.bench/afftdn-ep83` showed `anlmdn → afftdn` matches or beats `anlmdn → compand` on under-speech noise across all three test stems while keeping gaps clean with less floor modulation. The compand was a blunt downward expander that resolved to its gentlest 4 dB expansion on every stem and added floor pumping. `nr` is FIXED at 12 (not adaptive): a per-presenter sweep showed the noisiest voice must be capped at ~12 to avoid warble. afftdn is adaptive in three ways (`tuneNoiseReduction` in `adaptive.go`; `nr` and the whole anlmdn stage stay fixed): it is DROPPED when `Noise.VoiceActivated` is true (chain becomes anlmdn-only, TUI Denoise row reads "NLM" not "NLM+FFT") because voice-activated captures have digital-silence gaps with no floor for afftdn to lower and `track_noise` warbles on true silence; otherwise its `nf` is pinned to the measured noise floor (`Noise.Floor`, momentary-LUFS axis, re-clamped to afftdn's [-80, -20] dB) with `track_noise` OFF (`tn=0`), holding a static floor instead of self-tracking (floor ~1 dB deeper on average, speech identical, no added warble); and on a trustworthy room-tone region afftdn runs `nt=custom` with a measured per-band shape `bn` instead of the flat white model (see below). VoiceActivated is the only disable.

**Adeclick default:** Production uses `adeclick=t=1.7:w=55:o=50:m=s` (spline interpolation, halved overlap vs prior default) for ~75% Pass 4 runtime reduction at metric-parity quality; the gentle limiter attack keeps source clicks below the relaxed threshold. In benchmark context, refer to the production path as `adeclick_current_t_1_7_w_55_o_50_m_s`. No legacy variant is retained in the matrix. Note: adeclick runs at the source sample rate via an `aresample` inserted before it; loudnorm emits at 192 kHz when it falls back to dynamic mode (linear mode preserves the source rate), and running adeclick at that rate quadrupled its sample count - the dominant Pass 4 cost on long files until the resample was added.

**Normalisation (Pass 3/4):**
```
Pass 3: [volume (pre-gain, when clamped) → alimiter (levelling limiter)] → loudnorm (measure-only, print_format=json, stats_file) → reads back LoudnormStats JSON from the stats file
Pass 4: volume (pre-gain, when clamped) → alimiter (levelling limiter, peak reduction) → loudnorm (linear mode, input stats from Pass 3) → aresample (source rate) → adeclick → alimiter (final-stage brickwall, source rate) → astats → aspectralstats → ebur128
```

> The corpus derivation for the loudnorm and limiter tuning constants (`brickwallTruePeakHeadroomDB`, `measurementCushionDB`, `linearSafetyMargin`, the `loudnormTP`/`minLimiterCeiling` bounds) lives in `docs/Normalisation-Tuning.md`. The code comments point there (the limiter constants in `limiter.go`, the `loudnormTP` bounds in `normalise.go`); do not re-inline the rationale.

**Output filename:** `<name>-LUFS-NN-processed.<ext>` where NN is the rounded (nearest whole) absolute LUFS value of the final output (e.g., -26.8 LUFS produces `LUFS-27`). The matching always-on report is `<name>-LUFS-NN-processed.md`; analysis-only writes `<input>-analysis.md`.

**Diagnostic artefacts (`--diagnostics`, default OFF):** the flag gates three bulk diagnostic outputs written beside the `.md`/`.json`/`.flac`:
- The `.intervals.jsonl` + `.candidates.jsonl` sidecars. 📌 **Behaviour change:** these were always-on before the spectrogram feature; they are now opt-in. The `.json` run-record's inline summaries cover the OFF path (interval percentiles + largest gap; elected candidate + count/score), so the `.md`/`.json` stay fully populated without the flag.
- Before/after spectrogram PNGs, `<name>-LUFS-NN-processed.spectrogram-<kind>-<stage>.png` where `<kind>` is `whole`/`roomtone`/`speech` and `<stage>` is `before`/`after` (processing, ≤6 images: a kind's pair drops cleanly when no profile is elected) or `input` (analysis-only, ≤3 images, no "after"). Rendered via `showspectrumpic` from frozen parameters (`frozenSpectrogramSpec`: identical dimensions and dB/frequency scale across a before/after pair for honest comparison). The `## Spectrograms` report section links them.

**Report:** `internal/report` renders the always-on `.md` report from the run's `RunRecord` (never the `.json` artefact or `AudioMeasurements`), so a future `.json` → `.md` re-render is a thin adapter over `RenderMarkdown`. The report is empirical: objective metric definitions and units (sourced from `docs/Spectral-Metrics-Reference.md` via `definitions.go`), no quality verdicts or interpretive adjectives. The two star ratings are TUI-only (`renderDoneBox` in `ui/views.go`); never add them to the `.md`/`.json`. When the `RunRecord` carries spectrogram paths (`--diagnostics`), `renderSpectrograms` (`sections.go`) appends a `## Spectrograms` image-link table (before│after columns for processing, an Input column for analysis-only); the renderer reads the record only and never calls ffmpeg.

## Code style

- **Build requirement:** Always use `just build` - never `go build` directly (requires `CGO_ENABLED=1` + ldflags version injection)
- **FFmpeg types:** All prefixed with `AV*` (e.g., `AVCodecContext`, `AVFrame`)
- **C strings:** Use `ffmpeg.ToCStr()` and call `.Free()` when done
- **Error handling:** Wrap FFmpeg return codes with `WrapErr()` to convert to Go errors
- **Stream processing:** Check `AVErrorEOF` and `EAgain` for processing loops
- **Submodule:** Uses `github.com/linuxmatters/ffmpeg-statigo` in `third_party/ffmpeg-statigo/` (go.mod replace directive points there)
- **Debug logging:** `processor.DebugLog` is a package-level `func(string, ...any)` set by `main.go` when `--debug` is active; use `debugLog()` (internal wrapper) inside the processor package
- **Charm v2:** Import `charm.land/bubbletea/v2` and `charm.land/lipgloss/v2`; never `github.com/charmbracelet/...`. Models return `View() tea.View` built with `tea.NewView(...)`, not `View() string`. Match key presses on `tea.KeyPressMsg` (interface), not `tea.KeyMsg`. Set program options as View fields (`view.AltScreen = true`, `view.MouseMode = tea.MouseModeCellMotion`), not via `tea.WithAltScreen()`/`tea.WithMouseCellMotion()`. `lipgloss.Color` returns `image/color.Color`. The processing model (`model.go`) runs alt-screen (no native scrollback), so its file queue lives in a `charm.land/bubbles/v2/viewport`: built on the first `WindowSizeMsg` (sized to terminal height minus the rendered header). `View` has a VALUE receiver, so it must stay pure: content is set on the PERSISTENT viewport in `Update` via `refreshViewportContent` / `refreshViewportContentIfChanged`, never in `View` (a `SetContent` there mutates a throwaway copy and the real viewport stays empty/unscrollable). Stable queued/completed/error entries are cached by file status and terminal width; active entries are rendered in `Update` so meter ticks can compare the full rendered string and skip unchanged viewport writes without freezing visible meters. Scrolling: mouse wheel + pager keys are forwarded through `m.vp.Update(msg)` after `handleCommonMsg` (which owns the quit keys and the resize); that branch does NOT call `refreshViewportContent` (re-pinning would cancel an upward scroll). The header (title + overall box) is pinned outside the viewport. The viewport follows the active files (`refreshViewportContent` re-pins to bottom while the user is at bottom; a user who scrolls up keeps position).

## Testing instructions

- Run `just test` before committing
- **Never use `testdata/` files in untagged Go tests.** An untagged `go test` must be hermetic: exercise pure functions, in-memory `RunRecord`s and fixtures, and registry/filter lookups that need no audio file. Do not add untagged tests that decode or process `testdata/` audio files - synthetically generated audio written to `t.TempDir()` (e.g. `generateTestAudio`) is permitted - and do not add `findProbeAudioFile`/`requireTestdata`-style helpers to them. Reasons:
  - **CI has no `testdata/`.** The audio files (`LMP-*.flac`, `fixture-5m.flac`) are gitignored, so any test that decodes or processes them fails or skips in CI.
  - **They are slow.** Pushing real audio through the pipeline (and rendering spectrograms) drove `cmd/jive-vocals`'s `go test` to ~130s; `go test` must stay fast.
  - **Carve-out for `//go:build integration` tests.** A file tagged `//go:build integration` MAY decode `testdata/` audio and use fixture helpers such as `findPoolTestAudio` and `copyFixtureTo`. `just test` and CI run a plain `go test` (no `-tags integration`), so these files never compile there and they skip when `testdata/` is absent. The hermetic rule above governs every untagged test; the `integration` tag is the one exception.
- Audio-dependent checks belong in the gitignored manual validation harness under `testdata/validation-*/bin/` (shell scripts run by hand, e.g. `spectrogram-validate.sh`), never in the Go suite

## TUI message protocol

Two separate message sets exist for the two TUI modes.

**Processing mode** (`ui/messages.go`) - sent by the main processing goroutine:
- `ui.FileStartMsg` - file processing started
- `ui.ProgressMsg` - pass number, progress (0.0-1.0), current level, measurements
- `ui.FileCompleteMsg` - processing finished with result (or error in `Error` field); carries `Quality` (Processed score) + `RecordingQuality` (Recording score) for the done box
- `ui.AllCompleteMsg` - all files finished

**Analysis-only mode** (`ui/analysis_model.go`) - sent by `runAnalysisPool()` goroutines, routed by `FileIndex`:
- `ui.AnalysisStartMsg` - analysis started; carries `FileIndex`, `FileName`, `FilePath`
- `ui.AnalysisProgressMsg` - progress (0.0-1.0) and level update; carries `FileIndex`
- `ui.AnalysisCompleteMsg` - analysis finished; carries `FileIndex`, `Result`, and `Error`
- `ui.AllCompleteMsg` - all files finished (shared with processing mode; sent once after `wg.Wait()`)

## Adaptive processing

> For why each adaptation exists, in plain audio terms, see `docs/Pipeline.md`. This section is the spec: which knobs adapt, the functions and constants that drive them, and the corpus justification for the fixed values.

`AdaptConfig()` in `adaptive.go` derives per-file filter state from Pass 1 `AudioMeasurements`: it accepts caller-owned `BaseFilterConfig` defaults, returns `EffectiveFilterConfig` for filter building, and returns `AdaptiveDiagnostics` for report-only adaptation explanations. Do not reintroduce `FilterChainConfig` or store pass execution state in config; use `ProcessingFilterContext` for pass-local state. Each pool worker calls `BaseFilterConfig.CloneForWorker()` (shallow copy + deep-copy `FilterOrder` + per-worker logger) so concurrent workers share no mutable config or logger.

- **Rumble high-pass:** Fixed 80 Hz, 12 dB/oct (2-pole Butterworth), mix 1.0, non-adaptive. 80 Hz sits below every vocal fundamental (lowest measured male F0 ~91 Hz; female ~165+ Hz) and removes subsonic rumble before the gate. No content detection, no notch; tonal hum is left alone since a highpass cannot remove it
- **Band-limit low-pass:** Unconditional 20.5 kHz band-limit (12 dB/oct) for all content, giving downstream AAC/Opus/MP3 encoders a consistent bandwidth. Not adaptive: no content detection and no HF-noise tuning. 20.5 kHz is at the top of human hearing, so the band-limit is audibly transparent and only removes inaudible ultrasonics the lossy encoders discard anyway
- **Noise reduction (afftdn):** `tuneNoiseReduction` adapts the afftdn tail only; anlmdn and afftdn's fixed `nr=12` are untouched. Three adaptations: (1) afftdn is DISABLED when `Noise.VoiceActivated` (`AfftdnEnabled=false`, the chain is anlmdn-only) - voice-activated captures gate to digital silence (flatness ~0.01), so afftdn has no floor to lower and `track_noise` warbles on true silence; this is the only disable condition. (2) Otherwise `AfftdnNoiseFloor` is set from the measured `Noise.Floor` (momentary-LUFS axis), re-clamped to afftdn's [-80, -20] dB (`afftdnNoiseFloorMinDB`/`afftdnNoiseFloorMaxDB`), with `track_noise` OFF (`tn=0`) so afftdn holds the static measured floor instead of self-tracking (floor ~1 dB deeper on average, speech identical, no added warble). A zero `Noise.Floor` (unmeasured) leaves the defaults (afftdn on, `tn=1`, `nf` unset). (3) Custom noise profile: when the room-tone band measurement is trustworthy (`useCustomAfftdnProfile`), `AfftdnNoiseType` becomes `"custom"` and `AfftdnBandNoise` carries the measured shape, emitting `nt=custom:bn=...`; otherwise `nt=w` (white) stands. `nf` (absolute level) and `nr` (depth) still stack on top of `bn`; `bn` carries only the shape. The custom path needs ALL of: NOT voice-activated (afftdn must be on); `GateSeparationDB >= 12 dB` (`afftdnCustomMinSeparationDB`, below it the room tone may be speech-contaminated); room-tone `SpectralFlatness >= 0.45` (`afftdnCustomMinFlatness`, below it the floor is tonal and a measured shape over-fits peaks); and `NoiseProfile.BandsMeasured`. `bn` is built by `buildAfftdnBandNoise` from `measureNoiseBands`'s 15-band room-tone RMS spectrum (band centres 80 Hz to 24 kHz, `afftdnBandCentresHz`) as a RELATIVE shape `bn[i] = clip(bandLevel[i] - mean, +-24 dB)` (`afftdnBandShapeClipDB`); white is all-zeros. The 24 kHz top band sits above the 20.5 kHz band-limit and Nyquist so it is unmeasurable; non-finite bands are excluded from the mean and emitted as `0.0` (flat), never NaN. `BandsMeasured` requires >= 10 of 15 finite bands (`afftdnMinFiniteBands`), else white fallback; an empty `bn` also reverts to white (`sanitiseNoiseReductionConfig`). Known limitation: `measureNoiseBands` reads the raw room-tone region, so sub-80 Hz energy the rumble high-pass later removes still shows in the low bands, wasting shaping budget on empty bands; it cannot regress (validated) and is a future refinement (measure through the pre-afftdn high-pass/low-pass). Corpus A/B vs the white+nf path: 36 improved / 14 unchanged / 0 regressed, no warble (e.g. BF-08-stephen floor down ~7 dB); of 55 stems, 50 custom, 2 white fallback on low separation (LMP-81s-martin, LMP-81s-popey), 3 disabled (voice-activated). Diagnostics `afftdn_enabled`, `afftdn_noise_floor_db`, `afftdn_disable_reason`, `afftdn_noise_type`, `afftdn_band_noise` carry the decision to the report
- **Speech gate threshold:** Voiced-anchored in `calculateSpeechGateThreshold`: `threshold = VoicedLowPercentile - speechGateThresholdSpeechMarginDB` (6 dB below the voiced p10, the soft edge of speech), so the gate never attenuates a word. It returns a narrow-gap flag, set when that speech-side placement cannot also clear the loud noise (`GateSeparationDB < speechGateThresholdSpeechMarginDB + speechGateThresholdNoiseMarginDB`, i.e. separation < 12 dB); on a narrow gap the threshold stays on the speech side (never raised into the voice) and the flag feeds the depth step. Clamped [-80, -25] dB. The old aggression maths, `calculateAggression`, the aggression tiers, and the separation-based legacy split are gone. `calculateSpeechGateThresholdNoProfile` (noise floor plus a ratio-based gap, peak reference for high-crest room tone) is the deliberate no-`SpeechProfile` safety path (voiced statistics are unmeasurable without a profile); selection is structural, not numeric
- **Speech gate ratio:** LRA-based (`calculateSpeechGateRatio`): 1.5 for wide LRA (>15 LU, `speechGateRatioGentle`), otherwise 2.0 (`speechGateRatioMod`, the cap; a soft expander, never tighter). The former 2.5 tier is gone
- **Speech gate range (depth):** Fixed 14 dB (`speechGateDepthFixedDB`, the transparent-band midpoint), reduced to 8 dB (`speechGateDepthNarrowDB`) on a narrow gap so a shallow gate window does not pump the floor; never a full mute. Two fixed levels only (`calculateSpeechGateRangeDB`), never proportional to separation. The former noise-floor tiers (-22/-16 dB) and entropy tiers are gone
- **Speech gate attack:** Fixed 5 ms (`speechGateAttackMS`); opens before the consonant onset is shaved
- **Speech gate release:** Fixed 200 ms (`speechGateReleaseFixedMS`), with the hold folded in (`agate` has no hold parameter): long enough to ride intra-syllable dips without pumping, short enough to close cleanly at word ends. The former stacked LRA/flux/ZCR compensation (250-600 ms) is gone
- **Speech gate knee:** Fixed 3.0 (`speechGateKneeFixed`, named constant for tuning by ear); a soft knee stands in for the hysteresis `agate` lacks, smoothing the open/close boundary so the gate does not chatter on level wobble. No override; the same for all content
- **Speech gate detection:** Fixed RMS (safe for speech and tonal bleed). The former peak branch needed room-tone entropy > 0.7, which the corpus never reaches
- **Anti-hunting:** No gentle mode. The narrow-gap depth reduction (one signal, separation) prevents hunting on uniform quiet recordings; the former gentle-mode override (extreme LUFS gap + low LRA forcing ratio 1.2 and knee 2.0) is deleted
- **Levelling compressor:** Fixed params: ratio 3.0, attack 10 ms, release 200 ms, knee 4.0, mix 1.0, makeup 0 dB. One genuine adaptation: `threshold = max(SpeechProfile.RMSLevel, Dynamics.RMSLevel) + 9 dB` (clamped), falling back to `PeakLevel − 20 dB` when no `SpeechProfile` is elected. The full-file overall RMS floor (`Dynamics.RMSLevel`, same dBFS axis, raises-only, measurement-only) stops an anomalously quiet speech election from dragging the threshold too low; a NaN/Inf full-file RMS falls back to the raw speech RMS. Speech-RMS-relative threshold engages compression consistently on the upper half of speech across the corpus's wide input-level spread (depth ~2.5-4.4 dB, output crest in the 8-12 dB range); peak−20 is the fallback only. All other params are fixed: ratio/attack/release/knee/mix collapsed to a single value across the real corpus on review; kurtosis, flux, centroid, and the high-crest override were removed as theatre. Note: FFmpeg's `acompressor` is a single-pole-release RMS compressor (`af_sidechaincompress.c`); it levels gently rather than reproducing any vintage optical-compressor behaviour
- **De-esser intensity:** Only `i` adapts; `m` and `f` are fixed. Engagement is driven by the speech-region band excess `sibilanceExcess = SpeechProfile.SibBandRMS - BodyBandRMS` (dB), where the sibilant band is 6-9 kHz and the body band is 1-3 kHz, both measured over the elected speech region in Pass 1 (`analyser_bands.go`, region-scoped `highpass,lowpass,astats` decode). Mapping: `< -6 dB → i=0.0` (OFF); `-6..-3 → ramp 0.0→0.6`; `-3..0 → ramp 0.6→0.85`; `> 0 → i=0.85` (cap). Requires a `SpeechProfile`; without one the de-esser stays OFF (full-file metrics are unreliable). Fixed params: `f=0.80` sets the attenuator corner at ~7.5 kHz so it acts on the sibilant band rather than vocal presence (per `af_deesser.c`, `f` maps to the split-band corner; the prior `f=0.5` corner sat at ~2 kHz); `m=0.50` caps the maximum cut depth (~12 dB, `af_deesser.c maxdess`). Note `i` follows a 5th-power law (`pow(i,5)`) in `af_deesser.c`, so the ramp endpoints are chosen to land in the audibly-active part of the curve.

**Speech-aware metrics:** Filters processing speech content prefer `SpeechProfile` measurements (speech-only regions) over full-file analysis. Graceful fallback when speech metrics unavailable.

## Measurement axes

`AudioMeasurements` carries level and floor fields on THREE axes. They look alike (all dB-ish) but are not interchangeable. The trap: `AnalyseAudio` sets them in two phases - `buildInputMeasurements` first seeds astats-RMS values, then `detectVoiceActivity` OVERWRITES `Noise.Floor` and `NoiseProfile.MeasuredNoiseFloor` with the VAD momentary-LUFS percentile floor. So `MeasuredNoiseFloor` reads like an astats RMS field (it is seeded as `avgRMS`) but the elected value is momentary-LUFS.

| Axis | Fields |
| ---- | ------ |
| K-weighted momentary-LUFS (the VAD level axis) | `Noise.Floor`, `Noise.FloorPrescan`, `Noise.RoomToneDetectLevel`, `NoiseProfile.MeasuredNoiseFloor` (overwritten), `SpeechProfile.MomentaryLUFS`, any `RegionSample.MomentaryLUFS`, gate stats `VoicedLowPercentile` / `NoiseHighPercentile` / `GateSeparationDB` |
| Unweighted astats RMS dBFS | `Regions.ElectedRoomToneSample.RMSLevel`, `SpeechProfile.RMSLevel`, generic `RegionSample.RMSLevel` (input/filtered/final samples), `Dynamics.RMSLevel` / `Dynamics.PeakLevel`, `Noise.FloorAstats` |
| ebur128 BS.1770 integrated/true-peak/range | `Loudness.InputI` (LUFS) / `Loudness.InputTP` (dBTP) / `Loudness.InputLRA` (LU) |

Rules:

- **Never subtract or compare across axes.** An SNR or separation must use both operands on ONE axis. Correct: the `recording.go` cleanliness SNR is `SpeechProfile.MomentaryLUFS - NoiseProfile.MeasuredNoiseFloor` (both momentary-LUFS). Subtracting `SpeechProfile.RMSLevel` (astats) from the momentary-LUFS floor is the historical bug that miscalibrated the Recording star score.
- **Keep a given user-facing number on ONE axis everywhere it appears.** The DISPLAYED noise floor and SNR (TUI live Analysis box; TUI done-box before/after) are unweighted astats RMS dBFS, sourced from the room-tone `RegionSample.RMSLevel` (`ElectedRoomToneSample` for input, the output room-tone sample for after); both route through one resolver so they cannot diverge.
- **The momentary-LUFS floor is INTERNAL.** `Noise.Floor` / `MeasuredNoiseFloor` drive the VAD split, the Recording-score cleanliness axis, and the afftdn `nf` seed, and it is the report's `noise.floor_dbfs`. The report's `measured_floor_dbfs` equals `noise.floor_dbfs` (same momentary-LUFS `floor`); the room-tone samples' `rms_level_dbfs` is the astats-RMS room tone, a DIFFERENT number for the same region. Do not conflate them.
- When adding any consumer that reads a floor or level, check its axis in the table above first and keep the comparison single-axis.

## Spectral metrics reference

When working on audio analysis code (especially `internal/processor/analyser.go`):

- Consult `docs/Spectral-Metrics-Reference.md` (aligned with the `audio-metrics` skill) for what each metric is - definition, ffmpeg computation, units, range, source filter - when reading or producing audio measurements. It is an objective reference, not a source of thresholds or quality verdicts
- Threshold values and scoring constants live in the code, justified against the validation corpus per the "no theatre - meaningful, exercised adaptation or a fixed correct value" principle and the bit-exact validation sweeps; do not derive them from documented "good ranges"

For how and why the pipeline is built and tuned the way it is, in plain audio terms, see `docs/Pipeline.md`. For the influences behind the approach, see `docs/Inspiration.md` - the classic audio devices that shaped Jive Vocals' quality bar, named honestly as inspiration, not as circuits being reproduced.

## Release workflow

- **Create release:** `just release X.Y.Z` (validates format, checks uncommitted changes, creates annotated tag)
- **Preview changelog:** `just changelog`
- **List releases:** `just releases`
- **Check version:** `just version`
- **Publish:** `git push origin X.Y.Z` (triggers GitHub Actions workflow)

GitHub Actions automatically builds binaries for linux-amd64, linux-arm64, darwin-amd64, and darwin-arm64, then creates a GitHub release with a changelog. GitHub automatically provides SHA256 checksum files for release assets; do not flag `.github/workflows/builder.yml` for lacking a manual checksum-generation step.

## PR/commit guidelines

- Use Conventional Commits format
- Run `just lint` and `just test` before committing
- Version is injected at build time via ldflags from git tags
- GitHub Actions owns the pinned `govulncheck` SARIF scan; do not add it to `just lint` or flag local lint for omitting it
- `.github/dependabot.yml` keeps its `nix` ecosystem entry. GitHub Dependabot supports Nix flake inputs and the entry is intentional; never remove it
