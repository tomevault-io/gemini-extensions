## Project Structure
```
backend/
frontend/
tests/
```

## Commands

```bash
# Run unit tests only (fast, safe — no hardware I/O)
cd /home/pi/lawnberry && python -m pytest tests/unit/ -x -q -m "not hardware"

# Run a specific unit test file — NOTE: unit tests live in tests/unit/, NOT tests/
python -m pytest tests/unit/test_navigation_service.py -x -q
python -m pytest tests/unit/test_robohat_service.py -x -q

# Broader test run (may include integration tests — use the hardware filter)
python -m pytest tests/ -x -q -m "not hardware"

# Lint
ruff check backend/src

# Restart backend — NOTE: startup takes ~90 seconds (camera/AI init). Wait for health.
sudo systemctl restart lawnberry-backend
# Poll until the API responds (up to 2 min):
for i in $(seq 1 24); do sleep 5; curl -sf http://localhost:8081/api/v2/status && echo "UP" && break; echo "waiting... ($((i*5))s)"; done

# Tail backend logs
journalctl -u lawnberry-backend -f --no-pager
# OR
tail -f /home/pi/lawnberry/backend/backend.log
```

⚠️ **Test suite hang warning:** `python -m pytest tests/` without `-m "not hardware"` will hang
indefinitely because some tests block on hardware I/O (serial ports, I2C). Always filter or
set a per-test timeout. `pytest-timeout` is NOT installed; add `--timeout=N` only if it is.

**Test directory layout:**
- `tests/unit/` — fast unit tests (no hardware, always safe to run)
  - `tests/unit/test_navigation_service.py` — navigation unit tests (12 tests)
  - `tests/unit/test_robohat_service.py` — motor controller unit tests
- `tests/test_nav_coverage_patterns.py` — coverage/path algorithm tests (root level)
- `tests/test_nav_path_planner.py` — path planner tests (root level)
- `tests/test_mission_api.py` etc. — API integration tests (root level)

⚠️ **Wrong path anti-pattern:** `tests/test_navigation_service.py` does NOT exist — it is
at `tests/unit/test_navigation_service.py`. This mistake has caused repeated wasted runs.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Code Change Deployment Checklist

**After ANY commits to motor control, navigation, or driver code:**

This is **NOT optional** — changes to these systems do not become active until the backend is restarted and verified healthy. Skipping this step leads to debugging confusion (code is "fixed" but old code still running).

```bash
# 1. Clear Python bytecode cache (prevents stale .pyc from running)
find /home/pi/lawnberry -name "*.pyc" -delete
find /home/pi/lawnberry -name "__pycache__" -type d -exec rm -rf {} + 2>/dev/null || true

# 2. Restart the backend service
sudo systemctl restart lawnberry-backend

# 3. Poll until backend is healthy (startup takes ~90s, REQUIRED before testing)
for i in $(seq 1 24); do sleep 5; curl -sf http://localhost:8081/api/v2/status >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo "✓ Backend UP" && break; echo "waiting... ($((i*5))s)"; done

# 4. Verify full health (not just responsive)
curl -s http://localhost:8081/api/v2/status | jq '.safety_status'
```

**Do NOT claim a fix works until this checklist is complete.** If you get confused about whether a bug persists, first check: "Is the backend running my new code?"

## Motor Control Change Validation Pattern

⚠️ **CRITICAL: Two-Part Compensation System**

The LawnBerry motor control has **two interlocking compensation layers** that MUST be kept in sync:

1. **Navigation Service** (`backend/src/services/navigation_service.py:520-560`): Swaps left/right speed assignments
2. **RoboHAT Service** (`backend/src/services/robohat_service.py:835`): Inverts arcade mix sign

**If you modify ONLY ONE layer, the system breaks silently:**
- Remove arcade inversion but keep nav swap → joystick turns backward
- Remove nav swap but keep arcade inversion → navigation turns backward

**Validation Pattern (REQUIRED after any motor change):**

```bash
# Step 1: Unit tests first (fast, safe in SIM_MODE)
python -m pytest tests/unit/test_robohat_service.py tests/unit/test_navigation_service.py -xvs -m "not hardware"

# Step 2: If tests pass, restart backend (from checklist above)

# Step 3: Test joystick RIGHT TURN (left_motor must be POSITIVE, right_motor must be NEGATIVE)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/api/v2/control/drive \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"throttle": 0.0, "turn": 0.5}'
# Expected: left_motor_speed > 0, right_motor_speed < 0

# Step 4: Test LEFT TURN (right_motor must be POSITIVE, left_motor must be NEGATIVE)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/api/v2/control/drive \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"throttle": 0.0, "turn": -0.5}'
# Expected: right_motor_speed > 0, left_motor_speed < 0

# Step 5: Run a 2-waypoint test mission — mower MUST turn TOWARD first waypoint, not AWAY
# (Watch logs: tail -f logs/lawnberry.log | grep "NAV_CONTROL")
# If mower turns backward or joystick inverted, the two layers are out of sync.
```

**If joystick is correct but mission turns wrong (or vice versa):**
- The two compensation layers are out of sync
- Do NOT commit until BOTH pass
- Check recent changes — did you modify only one layer?

---

## Hardware vs. SIM_MODE Testing Boundaries

**SIM_MODE is safe for unit tests but has important limitations.** Know what each covers:

### What SIM_MODE SAFELY Covers ✅
- Navigation path planning and waypoint logic
- Motor compensation layer swaps
- API endpoint request/response contracts
- GPS/IMU data flow
- State machine transitions

Run safely: `pytest tests/unit/ -x -q -m "not hardware"`

### What SIM_MODE DOES NOT Cover ❌
- USB reconnect behavior during active motor commands
- E-stop responsiveness with transient serial drops
- Manual drive timeout enforcement under network stalls
- GPS autoprobe DTR-reset hazards
- Watchdog refresh timing constraints
- Actual motor acceleration curves

### Hardware Validation Required For:
- Any changes to `robohat_service.py` (USB communication, e-stop, watchdog)
- Any changes to `rest.py` drive endpoint (timeout enforcement)
- Any changes to `gps_driver.py` (autoprobe safety)
- Transient disconnect behavior (USB jiggle, cable flex)
- E-stop delivered during active motion

**When in doubt: "Does this change affect USB communication, timing constraints, or hardware state?" → Requires hardware validation before shipping.**

## Workflow Guidance

**New to this project or returning after time away?**
Read these in order:
1. `.github/WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md` — **START HERE** — Maps every task type to the right agent/mode/skill
2. `docs/developer-toolkit.md` — Architecture, key files, subsystems, runtime ports
3. `.github/agents/ORCHESTRATOR-QUICK-START.md` — How to use intelligent task routing

**Debugging a specific issue?**
→ Use `/agent` and select **LawnBerry Workflow Orchestrator**
→ It auto-detects the problem type and routes to the right specialist

**Writing new code or tests?**
→ Use `shift+tab` to switch Chat Modes (tests.software, webui.feature, sensors.hardware, etc.)

## Reasoning for problem solving approach
- Think like a developer when solving this issue, when you think you know how to attack the problem, think it through before deploying and make targeted/precise edits to avoid unintentionally causing issues with another part of the program.
- If you are unsure about something, ask for clarification or more information.

## **IMPORTANT** Running CLI Commands
- Always ensure you use timeouts and error handling when running CLI commands from within the codebase to avoid hanging processes or unhandled exceptions.

## When to Ask for Help
- If you encounter unfamiliar technologies or libraries.
- If you are unsure about the architecture or design decisions.

## What to do after completing a task
- Review your code for adherence to style guidelines and best practices.
- Write or update unit tests to cover new functionality or changes.
- Document any new features or changes in the relevant documentation files.
- Restart the backend and frontend servers to ensure all changes are applied.
- Run the full test suite to verify that no existing functionality is broken.

## Additional Notes
- Ensure to follow best practices for both backend and frontend development.
- Regularly update dependencies to maintain security and performance.

## Serial Port Assignments (FIXED — do not auto-detect)

| Device | Port | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| RoboHAT RP2040 (USB CDC) | `/dev/robohat` → `/dev/ttyACM0` | Primary motor controller path |
| BNO085 IMU | `/dev/ttyAMA4` | **NEVER probe/scan this port — corrupts IMU state** |
| ZED-F9P GPS | `/dev/lawnberry-gps` | USB, RTK |
| Hardware UART to RP2040 | `/dev/serial0` (ttyAMA0) | Firmware not yet deployed; do NOT confuse with IMU |

**Do NOT auto-detect or probe `/dev/ttyAMA4`** — opening it without the correct baud/protocol
corrupts the BNO085 sensor state and requires a power cycle.

## BNO085 IMU — Critical Facts

- Driver uses **Game Rotation Vector** (`game_quaternion`): gyro + accelerometer fusion only.
  **There is NO magnetometer in the heading output.** Motor EMI does NOT affect it.
- Convention: **ZYX aerospace / right-hand z-up** — positive yaw = CCW rotation.
  This is **opposite** to compass convention (CW = increasing bearing).
- The correct heading formula is: `adjusted_yaw = (-raw_yaw + imu_yaw_offset_degrees) % 360.0`
  (note the **negation** of raw_yaw — without it, CW turns decrease heading and navigation diverges)
- `imu_yaw_offset_degrees: 0.0` in `config/hardware.yaml` — the IMU is forward-facing and does
  not require mounting offset. The formula `(-raw_yaw + offset) % 360` alone handles the ZYX→compass
  convention conversion. **Do not change this value without understanding the heading oscillation root
  cause.**
  **Why 0.0 is correct and 180° is WRONG**: The `-raw_yaw` negation IS the ZYX→compass conversion
  (it flips CCW-positive → CW-positive). Adding `imu_yaw_offset_degrees = 180` on top of the
  negation applies the correction twice, which fully inverts all headings and causes the mower to
  drive away from every waypoint. This mistake has been made and reverted three times (commits
  `055635a` → `0dde5bc` → `17bfedc`). Do NOT change this to 180°. If you think the heading is
  ~180° off, the bug is elsewhere — check `_session_heading_alignment` in `data/imu_alignment.json`
  or verify the GPS COG bootstrap fired correctly.

## Motor / Navigation Direction Conventions

- **Motor Wiring Note**: Physical motors are wired with left/right swapped at MDDRC10 level.
  **Two-part compensation exists:**
  1. Navigation service swaps left_speed/right_speed assignments in both blended and tank-turn modes (lines 520-560)
  2. RoboHAT arcade mix inverts the sign: `angular = -(left_norm - right_norm) / 2.0` (line 835 of robohat_service.py)
  
  **CRITICAL**: These two pieces work together. Removing or changing only ONE breaks the system:
  - If you remove arcade inversion but keep navigation swap → joystick turns backward
  - If you remove navigation swap but keep arcade inversion → navigation turns backward
  - Both must be kept in sync. Changes to motor call arguments require changes to both
  
- `steer_us > 1500µs` → right turn (CW physically)
- `steer_us < 1500µs` → left turn (CCW physically)
- RoboHAT serial command: `pwm,<steer_us>,<throttle_us>`
- Dead zone: ~80µs around neutral (1500µs). Commands inside ±80µs are too weak to move on grass.
- When diagnosing motor issues: distinguish *what the code sends* (serial log `[USB]`) from
  *what the hardware does* (physical observation). `serial_connected: False` in software state
  does NOT mean the device is physically absent — it may mean USB error -71 (bad cable).

## Motor Control Debugging Flowchart

When the mower exhibits incorrect motor behavior (turns backward, asymmetric wheels, wiggling), follow this systematic approach:

**1. Test Joystick Control First (Isolates Code Path)**
```bash
# Right turn (should have left_motor > right_motor)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/api/v2/control/drive \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"throttle": 0.0, "turn": 0.5}'

# Response should show: {"left_motor_speed":0.5,"right_motor_speed":-0.5,"safety_status":"OK"}
# If backward: left < right, then problem is in arcade mix or robohat

# Left turn (should have right_motor > left_motor)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/api/v2/control/drive \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"throttle": 0.0, "turn": -0.5}'
```

**2. Test Motor Status (Hardware Connection)**
```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8081/api/v2/hardware/robohat | grep -o '"motor_status":"[^"]*"'
# Should show "idle" or current PWM values, NOT an error
```

**3. Check Navigation Logs During Mission (Isolated Code Path)**
```bash
# Run mission and watch these logs:
tail -f /home/pi/lawnberry/logs/lawnberry.log | grep "NAV_CONTROL"
# Look for: "target_bearing=XXX current_heading=YYY error=±Z"
# If error direction is wrong (turning away from target), navigation path has issue
```

**4. Diagnose the Root Cause**
- **Joystick inverted, Navigation correct**: Problem in arcade mix inversion (line 835 robohat_service.py) or RoboHAT
- **Navigation inverted, Joystick correct**: Problem in navigation's left/right swap (lines 520-560 navigation_service.py)
- **Both inverted**: Both layers have the wrong sign — look for recent changes that modified both simultaneously
- **Joystick correct, Mission wiggles**: Navigation swap is wrong but arcade mix is right — asymmetric compensation

**REQUIRED post-change validation — run BOTH paths before committing any motor change:**

```bash
# 1. Unit tests first
python -m pytest tests/unit/test_robohat_service.py tests/unit/test_navigation_service.py -xvs -m "not hardware"

# 2. Joystick path — right turn response: left_motor_speed MUST be > 0, right_motor_speed MUST be < 0
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/api/v2/control/drive \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"throttle":0.0,"turn":0.5}'

# 3. Navigation path — start a short 2-waypoint mission; mower MUST turn toward the first waypoint
#    Watch: tail -f logs/lawnberry.log | grep "NAV_CONTROL"
#    If mower turns AWAY from target bearing → navigation compensation layer is wrong
```

If joystick is correct but mission turns wrong (or vice versa), the two layers are out of sync.
Fix the failing layer — **never change one without re-validating the other**.

## Backend Startup Gotchas with Motor Changes

Motor control code runs during systemd service startup (navigation service initialization). Changes that cause hangs:

- **Swapping motor argument order** in `send_motor_command()` calls — may break initialization if navigation service calls motor functions during `__init__`
- **Changing function signatures** in `RoboHATService.send_motor_command()` — lifespan setup may parse or call this before full backend is ready
- **Adding new motor API endpoints** — ensure they don't require navigation service state that isn't initialized yet

**Safe Pattern for Motor Changes:**
1. Run unit tests first (fast, no hardware):
   ```bash
   python -m pytest tests/unit/test_robohat_service.py tests/unit/test_navigation_service.py -xvs -m "not hardware"
   ```
2. If tests pass, restart backend and poll until healthy — **startup takes ~90 seconds** (camera + AI service init):
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart lawnberry-backend
   for i in $(seq 1 24); do sleep 5; curl -sf http://localhost:8081/api/v2/status && echo "UP" && break; echo "waiting... ($((i*5))s)"; done
   ```
3. After backend is UP, validate BOTH motor code paths before committing:
   - **Joystick** (manual): `curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/api/v2/control/drive -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"throttle":0.0,"turn":0.5}'` → `left_motor_speed` > 0, `right_motor_speed` < 0
   - **Navigation** (mission): start a 2-waypoint test mission; mower must turn *toward* the first waypoint bearing, not away
4. If EITHER path is wrong, the two compensation layers are out of sync — do NOT commit until both pass

## Hardware Diagnostics Quick Reference

**Mower not responding to turn commands?** Use this checklist:

1. **Is the command reaching the hardware?**
   ```bash
   # Check motor status shows commands are being sent
   curl -s http://localhost:8081/api/v2/hardware/robohat | grep -o '"watchdog_latency_ms":[0-9.]*'
   # If > 1000ms or shows error, RoboHAT is not responding
   ```

2. **Is the command mathematically correct?**
   ```bash
   # Test via API and inspect the calculated speeds
   curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8081/api/v2/control/drive \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"throttle": 0.0, "turn": 0.5}'
   # For right turn: left_motor_speed should be > right_motor_speed
   ```

3. **Is the motor physically wired correctly?**
   - Left wheel should connect to MDDRC10 "right" port
   - Right wheel should connect to MDDRC10 "left" port
   - (They are swapped intentionally at the driver level)

4. **Check RoboHAT serial connection:**
   ```bash
   ls -l /dev/robohat /dev/ttyACM0
   # Both should exist and be readable. If missing, RoboHAT USB cable may be loose
   ```

5. **Check motor logs for delivery errors:**
   ```bash
   tail -50 /home/pi/lawnberry/logs/lawnberry.log | grep -i "motor\|pwm\|robohat"
   # Look for "Failed to deliver motor command" or serial errors
   ```

**Key distinction**: If API returns correct speeds but motors don't move → hardware issue (cable, driver, or RoboHAT firmware). If API returns inverted speeds → code issue (one of the two compensation layers is wrong).

## GPS COG Heading Bootstrap (Mission Start Behavior)

At the start of every mission, `_bootstrap_heading_from_gps_cog()` drives the mower ~1-2m forward
to acquire a GPS Course-Over-Ground (COG) reading and snap the IMU heading alignment to it.

**This is intentional behavior** — the mower WILL move forward a short distance before navigating
to the first waypoint. Ensure the area directly in front is clear before starting a mission.

**Verifying the bootstrap fired correctly** — watch for these log lines:
```
INFO  Heading bootstrap: driving forward to acquire GPS COG snap...
INFO  HDG snap-calibrated from GPS COG: delta=X° new_align=Y°
```
If you see the second line with a `delta` close to 0°, the IMU was already well-aligned.
If `delta` is large (>30°), it means the IMU had significant heading error that was corrected.

**If the bootstrap does NOT fire or shows no COG snap:**
```
WARN  GPS COG bootstrap timed out — no valid COG acquired
```
Check:
1. GPS fix quality: `curl -s http://localhost:8081/api/v2/sensors/gps` — needs RTK_FIXED or GPS_3D
2. Speed threshold: mower must reach ≥0.3 m/s for COG to be valid — check for obstacles or motor issues
3. `data/imu_alignment.json` — if `source` is `"mission_start_reset"` and `alignment` is 0.0, the
   bootstrap did not complete; if `source` is `"gps_cog_snap"`, it succeeded

**After a successful mission start**, `data/imu_alignment.json` will contain:
```json
{"alignment": <degrees>, "source": "gps_cog_snap", "samples": 1, "timestamp": "..."}
```

## Python Bytecode Cache

After editing any `.py` file that runs as a **systemd service** (watchdog, backend), clear the
bytecode cache or the service will keep running old code from `__pycache__`:

```bash
find /home/pi/lawnberry -name "*.pyc" -delete
find /home/pi/lawnberry -name "__pycache__" -type d -exec rm -rf {} + 2>/dev/null || true
sudo systemctl restart lawnberry-backend
```

Alternatively, set `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1` in the systemd unit environment.

## Maintainer handbook usage

- Treat `docs/developer-toolkit.md` as the maintainer-facing orientation document for this repository.
- At the start of substantial maintenance, planning, roadmap, runtime-contract, hardware-scope, simulation-vs-hardware, or subsystem-maturity work, read `docs/developer-toolkit.md` and follow its guidance.
- When changes affect runtime behavior, supported hardware scope, subsystem maturity, immediate-focus priorities, the 2-week execution plan, or high-level next steps, update `docs/developer-toolkit.md` in the same pass.
- Do not treat `docs/developer-toolkit.md` as optional background reading; use it to keep implementation, prioritization, and documentation aligned for returning maintainers.

## Automated code structure documentation sync

To keep our developer docs accurate, the Copilot Agent must automatically update `docs/code_structure_overview.md` whenever structural code changes occur (new/removed files, added/removed functions, or signature changes) in these areas:

- `backend/src/**` (Python services, nav algorithms, CLI, tools)
- `frontend/src/**` (TypeScript/Vue services, composables, utils)
- `scripts/**` and `.specify/scripts/**` (Ops tooling)

Agent workflow requirements:

1) Detect change triggers
	- On any PR or commit that touches the paths above, or when explicitly asked to “regenerate code structure overview,” run the scan.

2) Scan workspace for callable interfaces
	- Python: list module-level functions and public class methods (exclude private names starting with `_` unless necessary for clarity). Capture argument names and defaults from signatures.
	- TypeScript: list exported functions and exported const arrow functions; include argument names and basic types when present.
	- Shell scripts: list defined shell functions when they exist; otherwise mark as CLI entrypoint.

3) Infer subsystem category
	- Use directory and filename hints (e.g., `services/` → backend services; `nav/` → Navigation; `composables/` or `services/` in frontend → Frontend; `scripts/` → Ops/DevOps).

4) Update the document in place
	- Rewrite sections and tables in `docs/code_structure_overview.md` to reflect the current state. Preserve section ordering and headings; replace table rows as needed.
	- Ensure each entry contains: relative path, 1–2 sentence purpose, subsystem category, and callable interfaces with argument signatures.

5) Validate
	- Re-read changed files to confirm the listed signatures match the source.
	- Keep lines <= 120 chars where practical for readability.

6) Commit
	- Include the doc update in the same PR as the code change, or push as a follow-up commit titled: `docs: update code_structure_overview.md (auto)`. 

Template cues the Agent should preserve:
- Group by subsystem with Markdown tables per group.
- Prefer public APIs; mark clearly when listing internal helpers for context.

This directive is persistent. Any code change affecting callable interfaces must be accompanied by an updated `docs/code_structure_overview.md` generated by the Agent.
