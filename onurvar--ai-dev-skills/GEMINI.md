# ai-dev-skills

A Claude Code plugin marketplace for iOS, Android, and React Native development. Users add it via `/plugin marketplace add <this-repo>` and install the stack-specific plugins they need.

This file is the **reference point for contributors** working on this repo. It captures the design decisions we've locked in — purpose, structure, principles, review pipeline, how to add stacks, what to include and what to exclude. Read this before adding, removing, or changing any plugin.

## What this repo is

Six plugins — five per-stack, one platform-neutral:

| Plugin | Covers | Skills | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ov-ios` | Native iOS (Swift / SwiftUI / UIKit / Obj-C) | init, plan, review-deep | Rules file drafted; skills scaffolded |
| `ov-android` | Native Android (Kotlin / Java / Jetpack Compose) | init, plan, review-deep | Rules file drafted; skills scaffolded |
| `ov-rn-typescript` | React Native TypeScript / JS layer | init, plan, review-deep | Rules file drafted; skills scaffolded |
| `ov-rn-ios-native` | React Native iOS bridge (Swift / Obj-C) | init, plan, review-deep | Rules file drafted; skills scaffolded |
| `ov-rn-android-native` | React Native Android bridge (Kotlin / Java) | init, plan, review-deep | Rules file drafted; skills scaffolded |
| `ov-pr` | Any stack — lightweight GitHub PR review | review-quick | Drafted |

**Naming convention:** every plugin is `ov-` prefixed so that typing `/ov` in Claude Code lists exactly these commands and nothing else. The two review commands are named for their depth, not gated behind a flag: `review-deep` is the multi-tool pipeline over your own pending changes, `review-quick` is one pass over someone's open PR.

## Installation

Two ways, depending on your environment:

**Option A — Claude Code plugin marketplace (`/plugin`, when permitted):**

```
/plugin marketplace add /path/to/ai-dev-skills
/plugin install ov-ios@ai-dev-skills
# repeat for ov-android, ov-rn-typescript, ov-rn-ios-native, ov-rn-android-native, ov-pr
```

Skills are invoked as `/ov-ios:init`, `/ov-ios:plan`, `/ov-ios:review-deep`, `/ov-pr:review-quick`, etc. (plugin-namespaced with a colon).

**Option B — filesystem install via `./install.sh`** (when `/plugin` is forbidden or unavailable):

```
./install.sh              # symlink (default) — edits to this repo propagate
./install.sh --copy       # snapshot copy — self-contained
./install.sh --uninstall  # remove everything the script installed
./install.sh --help       # full usage
```

Skills are invoked as `/ov-ios-init`, `/ov-ios-plan`, `/ov-ios-review-deep`, `/ov-pr-review-quick`, etc. — colon becomes dash since user-level skills aren't plugin-namespaced. Rules files land at `~/.claude/ai-dev-skills/rules/<stack>.md` (filenames stay unprefixed; the prefix exists for command discovery, and rules files are never invoked). Each stack's `init` skill resolves both the plugin path and this manual path so either install mode works.

Re-running `./install.sh` after a rename prunes the entries an earlier install created that the current one no longer produces, so stale symlinks don't accumulate in `~/.claude/skills/`.

## Per-plugin structure

Per-stack plugins are identical to each other:

```
plugins/ov-<stack>/
├── .claude-plugin/plugin.json
├── rules/<stack>.md                  ← always-on rules, imported into user's CLAUDE.md
└── skills/
    ├── init/SKILL.md                 ← /ov-<stack>-init        — bootstraps @import into project CLAUDE.md
    ├── plan/SKILL.md                 ← /ov-<stack>-plan        — planning ritual
    └── review-deep/SKILL.md          ← /ov-<stack>-review-deep — review pipeline
```

The platform-neutral plugin has no rules file — it carries no standing stack knowledge:

```
plugins/ov-pr/
├── .claude-plugin/plugin.json
└── skills/review-quick/SKILL.md      ← /ov-pr-review-quick     — one-pass PR review
```

**Why this shape:**

- **`rules/<stack>.md`** — always-on knowledge. When imported into a project's CLAUDE.md, every Claude session in that project loads it automatically. It is also load-bearing for review: `/pr-review-toolkit:review-pr`, `/security-review`, `/simplify`, `/code-review:code-review` all read CLAUDE.md to know what rules to apply.
- **`skills/init/`** — the bootstrap ritual. A plugin cannot modify the user's project CLAUDE.md directly, so `/ov-<stack>-init` copies the rules file into `.claude/<stack>-rules.md` and appends an `@import` line to the project's CLAUDE.md.
- **`skills/plan/`** — the before-implementation ritual.
- **`skills/review-deep/`** — the after-implementation ritual; orchestrates the full pipeline.
- **`skills/review-quick/`** — the read-someone-else's-PR ritual; deliberately not a pipeline.

Skill frontmatter carries `description` only, no `name` — the directory name is what becomes the command, in both install modes.

## Design principles (non-negotiable)

1. **One command per phase, no flags.** `/ov-<stack>-plan`, `/ov-<stack>-review-deep`. No `--fast` / `--deep` variants. Pick one behavior per command and make it right. If flags start creeping back, something is wrong with the default. `/ov-pr-review-quick` is not an exception to this — it takes a different input (someone else's open PR, not your pending changes) and answers a different question, so it's a separate command with one fixed behavior rather than a depth flag on `review-deep`.

2. **Chain upstream plugins, don't copy.** We invoke `/pr-review-toolkit:review-pr`, built-in `/security-review`, built-in `/simplify`, and `/code-review:code-review`. We do not re-implement them. Our value is the stack-specific pre-check, the CLAUDE.md rules we inject via `init`, and the noise filter we apply.

3. **Rules live in files, not in skills.** Standing knowledge (language, concurrency, memory rules) goes in `rules/<stack>.md` and reaches the user via CLAUDE.md `@import`. Skills are for rituals (init, plan, review), not for holding rules.

4. **Reviews are high-signal only.** Every review must filter out:
   - Pure style, whitespace, formatting, import order
   - Anything a linter / formatter / compiler catches (SwiftLint, SwiftFormat, ktlint, tsc, ESLint, Xcode warnings)
   - Pedantic naming, "could be shorter" suggestions
   - Pre-existing issues on lines not in the diff
   - Findings about languages or frameworks not in the current diff
   - Low-impact nits a senior engineer would not raise
   - Anything below 80% confidence

   Every `rules/<stack>.md` has a `## Review behavior` section that encodes this filter so downstream reviewers apply it. Every `/ov-<stack>-review-deep` orchestrator applies the filter again in its aggregation step (belt-and-suspenders). `/ov-pr-review-quick` applies a stricter version of the same filter — see its section below.

5. **Skills read, rules govern.** Because downstream reviewers read CLAUDE.md for rules, the CLAUDE.md `@import` chain is the load-bearing mechanism. Skills only orchestrate the pipeline.

6. **Every command is `ov-` prefixed.** The prefix is the whole reason these skills are findable in a `/` menu shared with built-ins and third-party plugins. A new plugin without it is a bug, not a style choice.

## Review pipeline (every `/ov-<stack>-review-deep`)

Run these steps in order, then aggregate and filter:

1. **Stack-specific pre-check.** Inline in the skill. Catches what generic reviewers miss (e.g., `@MainActor` violations and retain cycles on iOS; lifecycle leaks on Android; bridge marshalling errors on RN).
2. **`/pr-review-toolkit:review-pr`** — invoked via the Skill tool. Picks sub-agents per file type. Reads project CLAUDE.md (which imports our rules).
3. **`/security-review`** — built-in, invoked via the Skill tool.
4. **`/simplify`** — built-in, invoked via the Skill tool.
5. **`/code-review:code-review`** — invoked via the Skill tool. Adapts to context:
   - **PR open:** runs as-designed; posts a filtered comment to the PR.
   - **No PR:** runs the 5 parallel Sonnet agents on local `git diff`; skips PR eligibility check and `gh pr comment`; returns findings to our aggregator.
6. **Aggregate + noise filter.** De-duplicate across steps, apply the filter one more time, output Critical / Important / Suggestions + a Status block noting which tools ran and where the code-review output went.

If any companion plugin is not installed, the review skill notes it and skips that step gracefully — the pipeline degrades but does not error.

## Lightweight review (`/ov-pr-review-quick`)

The opposite end from the pipeline above: one reader, one pass over a GitHub PR, at most three findings, posted as short per-line questions. It is platform-neutral and works unchanged for Swift, Kotlin, and TypeScript.

The calibration *is* the skill. Guard it:

- **Depth is the middle setting.** Every file gets read once and understood; no file gets interrogated. Not a skim (catches nothing), not a multi-pass audit (that's `review-deep`).
- **Findings need an obvious trigger** — something an attentive reader notices reading the file once, visible on the line rather than derived from a model of the system. Anything that takes a deliberate hunt (reasoning through a threading model to find a race, checking business rules against a spec) is out of scope by design, because nothing in the diff points at it.
- **Cheap confirmation before posting.** Read the function it calls; prove a language claim with a three-line snippet. Chasing one lead into one other file is in budget; investigating a subsystem is not. If it doesn't hold up, drop it — a confident wrong finding costs more than a missed one.
- **Hard cap of three.** A number, not a vibe. Zero is a valid result. Never pad.
- **Nitpicks are excluded, not ranked last.** Mentioning them spends the credibility the real findings need. Minor-but-real observations get one labeled line at the bottom, or nothing.
- **One reader holds the whole diff.** No subagents, no fan-out. Split the diff across agents and each one sees a defensible line while nobody sees the chain.
- **Comments are questions, not verdicts.** The author may know a constraint the reviewer doesn't.
- **Posting is not one-shot.** Draft in chat, post on approval, edit afterwards — wording iterations are cheap.

Do not add sub-skill invocations, agent fan-out, confidence scoring, or a categorized output document to this skill; those already exist in `review-deep`, and duplicating them defeats the purpose. Do not add per-platform "what to look for" lists either — that's how a lightweight skill grows back into a heavy one.

## Planning ritual (every `/ov-<stack>-plan`)

Produces a written plan before any code is written. Five required sections:

1. **Architecture decisions** — stack-specific (e.g., SwiftUI vs UIKit, Compose vs View for Android, store shape for RN)
2. **Simplify pressure-test** — avoid premature abstraction, minimize surface area, no speculative features, no backwards-compat shims without real external consumers, three similar call sites is fine
3. **Security threat-model** — sensitive data, storage, network, input surfaces specific to the stack
4. **Testing strategy** — what to test, at which boundary, with what tools
5. **Rollout** — feature flag (usually no), migration, telemetry, rollback

## What NOT to include in plugins

- **Style / formatting rules.** Delegate to SwiftLint, SwiftFormat, ktlint, Prettier, tsc, ESLint. These are linter jobs, not Claude jobs.
- **AI-prompting meta** ("be concise", "think step-by-step"). We write rules about code, not about Claude.
- **Org-specific content** (team names, Slack channels, ticket patterns, internal URLs). These belong in the user's project CLAUDE.md, never in our plugin's rules.
- **Generic platitudes.** Every rule must be specific, actionable, opinionated, and non-obvious to a senior engineer. "Write clean code" is not a rule.
- **Backwards-compat shims** for API surfaces we own. If we change a rule, change it — don't keep both.

## Adding a new stack

1. `mkdir plugins/ov-<new-stack>` and create `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` with `"name": "ov-<new-stack>"` (copy from `plugins/ov-ios/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and adjust name / description / keywords).
2. Digest source repos into `rules/<new-stack>.md` (filename unprefixed). Follow the iOS rules file structure (Review behavior, Architecture, language rules, Concurrency / lifecycle, Memory, Security, Testing, Accessibility, References).
   - The `## Review behavior` section is **verbatim** across stacks except for the scope sentence (which names the stack's languages / frameworks).
3. Write `skills/init/SKILL.md` — copies `rules/<stack>.md` into the project's `.claude/` directory and appends `@import` to CLAUDE.md.
4. Write `skills/plan/SKILL.md` — the 5-section planning ritual with stack-specific checklists.
5. Write `skills/review-deep/SKILL.md` — the 6-step review pipeline.
6. Add a plugin entry in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`.
7. Add the stack slug to `STACKS` in `install.sh`.
8. Update the "What this repo is" table above.

## How rules files are built

Source reference repos are shallow-cloned into `references/` (git-ignored). For each new stack we delegate a digest agent that reads only the mapped repos and writes the draft `rules/<stack>.md`. Stack-by-stack, not all at once — easier to review each one.

### Stack → source repo mapping

| Stack | Source repos |
|---|---|
| `ios` | [steipete/agent-rules](https://github.com/steipete/agent-rules), [twostraws/SwiftAgents](https://github.com/twostraws/SwiftAgents), [AvdLee/SwiftUI-Agent-Skill](https://github.com/AvdLee/SwiftUI-Agent-Skill) |
| `android` | [android/nowinandroid](https://github.com/android/nowinandroid), [Kotlin/kotlin-agent-skills](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlin-agent-skills) |
| `rn-typescript` | [vercel-labs/agent-skills](https://github.com/vercel-labs/agent-skills), [callstackincubator/agent-skills](https://github.com/callstackincubator/agent-skills) |
| `rn-ios-native` | [steipete/agent-rules](https://github.com/steipete/agent-rules), [twostraws/SwiftAgents](https://github.com/twostraws/SwiftAgents), [AvdLee/SwiftUI-Agent-Skill](https://github.com/AvdLee/SwiftUI-Agent-Skill), [callstackincubator/agent-skills](https://github.com/callstackincubator/agent-skills) |
| `rn-android-native` | [android/nowinandroid](https://github.com/android/nowinandroid), [Kotlin/kotlin-agent-skills](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlin-agent-skills), [callstackincubator/agent-skills](https://github.com/callstackincubator/agent-skills) |

Duplicates across stacks are expected — the native-iOS rules feed both the pure iOS plugin and the RN iOS bridge plugin, for example.

Digest philosophy: extract only correctness, security, and stack-specific concerns. Drop style, formatting, AI-prompting meta, org-specific content. If a source repo contributes thin content, use senior-engineer defaults rather than pad with generic advice.

## Companion plugins (not bundled, invoked by our review skills)

Our `/ov-<stack>-review-deep` chain expects these to be available on the user's machine. `/ov-pr-review-quick` needs none of them — only `gh`:

| Plugin | Source | Used in |
|---|---|---|
| `pr-review-toolkit` | `claude-plugins-official` marketplace | review step 2 |
| `security-review` | built-in Claude Code | review step 3 |
| `simplify` | built-in Claude Code | review step 4 |
| `code-review` | `claude-plugins-official` marketplace | review step 5 |

We do not declare these as hard dependencies in `plugin.json`. Each review skill checks at runtime and skips gracefully if a companion is missing.

## When adding / changing rules

- If you're editing `rules/<stack>.md`, keep the `## Review behavior` section intact and verbatim across stacks (except the scope sentence).
- If you're adding a new rule, verify it passes the quality bar: specific, actionable, opinionated, non-obvious.
- If you're removing a rule, note in the commit message which source repo it came from (check the References section at the bottom of each rules file).
- If you're adding a new source repo, clone it into `references/` and update the stack-to-repo table above.

## When adding / changing skills

- Skills are rituals, not rules. If content feels like a standing rule, move it to `rules/<stack>.md` and have the skill reference it instead.
- Every skill has a `description` frontmatter field that governs auto-invocation. Keep it specific — vague descriptions cause spurious invocations. With two review commands, each description must say which one to prefer and when, or Claude will pick the wrong one.
- If a skill starts accumulating flags or branches, rethink. One command per phase, no flags is the rule.
- New skills go in an `ov-` prefixed plugin, and if they should ship in the filesystem install, they need a line in `install.sh` (`RITUALS` for a per-stack ritual, `EXTRAS` for a platform-neutral one).
- **Cross-references between skills use the dash form** (`/ov-ios-init`, not `/ov-ios:init`), because `install.sh` is the primary install mode here and the colon form doesn't resolve there. The only colon-form mentions in the repo are in the Installation section above, where the point is to document the difference. Catalog text in `marketplace.json` and `plugin.json` names skills without a leading slash so it stays correct in either mode.
