# AGENTS.md

This repository is for Workstream, source-agnostic governed contribution
infrastructure for work performed by humans, AI agents, or both.

## Core Definition

Workstream turns project-defined tasks, immutable submissions, policy-governed
checks, and policy-governed acceptance into trusted `ContributionRecord` facts. Those
facts establish who completed what, under which locked rules, using which exact
artifact, and with what verified outcome. Applications and economic systems may
consume the facts; they do not control Workstream lifecycle truth.

Flow Identity is the current v0.1 external authentication provider, not the
definition or ownership boundary of Workstream.

## Working Rules

- Workstream is developing its first, unreleased v0.1. Do not introduce
  backward-compatibility layers, compatibility aliases, parallel old/new
  implementations, or “legacy/modern” variants merely to preserve earlier
  development code. When changing a module, replace the superseded implementation
  and update its affected callers, tests, schemas and current documentation
  together. Remove obsolete code and tests that exist only to preserve obsolete
  behavior; retain or replace tests protecting required behavior. Renaming
  duplicate implementations is not cleanup.

  Perform this cleanup within the current work’s affected scope, not as a
  repository-wide prerequisite. Trace shared consumers before deleting shared
  code; identify any remaining dependency explicitly without adding another
  compatibility path. Preserve authorization, locked lineage, atomicity and
  immutable evidence. Business policy/submission versions and required external
  protocol identifiers are not backward-compatibility implementations. Code
  cleanup does not authorize deleting retained data.
- Keep wording consistent with `README.md`, `docs/glossary.md`, and `docs/architecture_lockdown.md`.
- Keep pre-submission intake quality checks distinct from post-submission work
  evaluation. Intake failures prevent Submission creation; post-submit results
  supply evidence for policy-governed routing, not checker-owned acceptance.
  The locked ReviewPolicy requires human review by default; when false, passing
  required checks invokes the same authorized final-acceptance operation used
  by human `accept`. Never fabricate a Review or reviewer contribution.
  Do not describe all checking as
  deterministic or confuse setup-agent policy proposals with runtime evaluators.
  Model-based judges require supported registered implementations; do not claim
  them live merely because setup uses an agent.
- Use the simple engineering loop:
  `Intent -> Plan -> Bounded Change -> Tests -> Review -> PR -> Human Merge`.
- Inspect existing owners, call paths, policies, contracts and tests before
  designing a change. Prefer extending the existing operation over adding a
  parallel subsystem. Different triggers for the same business outcome normally
  share one operation and transaction, with explicit trigger provenance.
  Add an abstraction, policy, state or workflow only for a concrete requirement
  the existing design cannot safely meet; explain that gap in the change record.
  Keep control flow and dependencies explicit. Prefer small, cohesive functions
  and the fewest concepts needed for current behavior; do not add frameworks,
  generic helpers, configuration knobs or indirection for hypothetical future use.
  Make required behavior testable through stable owner interfaces and focused
  fixtures. Tests should protect outcomes and failure boundaries rather than
  mirror implementation details. Use broad fixtures or mock graphs only when
  the integration risk requires them.
  Simplicity must preserve authorization, locked lineage and atomicity.
- Keep the engineering loop separate from the Workstream product lifecycle. Workstream product review decisions remain `accept`, `needs_revision`, and `reject`; internal engineering reviewer findings are process evidence, not product decisions.
- Codex-discoverable repository skills live under `.agents/skills/`.
- Codex custom reviewer agents live under `.codex/agents/`.
- The lead uses the repository's Astra default; delegated work uses Sol with
  high reasoning. `.codex/config.toml` and the custom agent files own executable
  settings. Explicit user/session selections take precedence; do not silently
  escalate models or claim an existing session changed model after editing TOML.
- Durable engineering context uses the smallest applicable Commitrail record
  under `.commitrail/`. `.commitrail/INDEX.md` is durable navigation; GitHub
  open pull requests are the transient-work view. Review evidence is never an
  active-work queue or authorization source.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` is the canonical human and agent entry path. GitHub
  permissions and branch protection govern contribution authority. Planning
  artifacts explain work; they do not authorize or block it.
- Distinct initiatives may proceed concurrently in separate branches or
  worktrees.
- Do not add Claude-specific files unless the user explicitly asks for cross-tool support.
- Do not use old names such as "task-production control plane" or "Garden roadmap".
- Spreadsheet exports live locally under ignored `sheets/`; do not commit them.
- Do not add extra sheets to local `sheets/workstream_roadmap.xlsx`; the workbook must contain one sheet only: `WorkStream RoadMap`.
- Treat local `sheets/workstream_roadmap.xlsx` as the primary spreadsheet export. The CSV is fallback only.
- If updating the roadmap, update both local XLSX and CSV exports.
- Do not import XLSX into Google Sheets with "replace spreadsheet"; use a temporary sheet and copy only the roadmap tab.
- Prefer evidence-backed docs over vague product claims.
- Treat `docs/roadmap_status.md` as the current capability ledger. Calendar
  plans, early chunk specifications, imported files under
  `docs/reference_specs/`, and internal reviews are historical evidence unless
  a current entry page explicitly adopts them. Canonical repository
  specifications remain normative. Do not use dates, weeks, or delivery
  windows as implementation authority.
- For workflow states, persisted tokens, API enum values, roles, and lifecycle names, prefer subsystem- or actor-specific names over vague labels. If the naming has product or security impact and the user is unavailable, run the required internal reviewer tracks before locking it.
- Keep v0.1 focused on project guide -> task -> pre-submission intake checks
  -> submission -> post-submission work evaluation -> review
  -> revision -> contribution records -> conditional compensation
  awards/fulfillment -> contribution evidence for a future reputation
  projection. Runtime reputation projection remains deferred.
- Review decision stored values are only accept, needs_revision, or reject.
- Frontend is locked as React + Vite + TypeScript.
- Backend API is locked as Python with FastAPI.
- ORM, migrations, and API schemas are locked as SQLAlchemy 2.x async + Alembic + Pydantic schemas.
- Workstream verifies external Flow authentication tokens; do not add Workstream-owned login, signup, password reset, password storage, or primary auth sessions.
- v0.1 delivery is backend-contract-first. Do not add frontend behavior until
  the backing API contracts and lifecycle guards for that surface are stable
  and tested.
- Execution is async-first; do not document synchronous-first checkers or jobs.
- FastAPI background tasks are acceptable for simple local v0.1 jobs; use Celery or equivalent durable workers when retries, scheduling, isolation, or distributed execution are needed.
- Postgres is the record database.
- Local filesystem storage is acceptable only behind the provider-neutral
  `ArtifactStore`; AWS S3 is the v0.1 hosted provider and MinIO proves its
  protocol locally and in CI.
- Bounded private ephemeral processing scratch is not artifact storage. It may
  use local files only through the canonical `ArtifactScratchManager` with
  aggregate quotas, crash cleanup, and no durable product reference.
- Do not expand into blockchain settlement, marketplace, external source adapters, automated routing, or agent workspace until the internal loop is proven.
- External integrations must follow ADR 0014: extend the shared
  `ExternalServiceAdapter` convention through a typed capability port and use a
  typed `ExternalServiceAdapterFactory[TAdapter]` with explicit
  composition-root registration. Do not add ad hoc factories, runtime plugin
  discovery, generic service locators, concrete-adapter imports in product
  services, compatibility aliases, fallback constructors, or dual factory
  paths.
- Every non-trivial task starts with the smallest useful Commitrail record: one
  combined change record for meaningful bounded work, plus one concise
  initiative overview only for multi-PR work.
- Standalone changes use `.commitrail/changes/<lowercase-kebab-slug>.md`, declare
  exactly one live `Initiative: None`, and need no initiative overview or index
  row. Existing initiatives keep their records.
  Editorial README/ordinary-doc corrections may use PR intent and scope only;
  `.commitrail/README.md` lists process-control paths that always need a record.
- Do not implement a bounded change until its allowed files, prohibited
  changes, acceptance criteria, risk class, verification, reviewers, and human
  review focus are explicit.
- One bounded implementation change equals one pull request. The same PR
  records its intended durable outcome. Update an initiative overview or index
  row only when its durable disposition or next usable boundary changes. Use
  only `Planned`, `Complete`, `Stopped`, or `Superseded`; never commit transient
  review, CI, approval, or merge state.
- Do not begin the next chunk automatically after finishing the current chunk.
- Use internal sub-agent review proportionate to risk. Security, authorization,
  payment, architecture, workflow, and broad product changes require focused
  review; small low-risk changes do not require ceremonial fanout.
- Select reviewers through `.ci/reviewer-evidence/REVIEWER_MATRIX.md` and the
  current change's impact. The lead runs shared checks once, freezes a clean
  candidate, and supplies bounded context. Reviewers independently inspect their
  assigned risks and relevant unchanged owners. Batch valid repairs before
  asking affected reviewers to replay; do not push between each reviewer finding.
- Continue authorized work through fixes and verification. Repeated failure
  requires a diagnosis of the failing assumption and a discriminating check.
  Ask for direction only when a material decision or new authority is missing;
  a repair counter, planning artifact, or reviewer session error is not a new
  permission boundary.
- For architecture, CI/workflow, docs, or reuse-sensitive chunks, add the matching reviewer track from `.codex/agents/`.
- Do not report work complete while requested reviewer agents are still running. Wait for them, address valid findings, and close any open sub-agent sessions.
- CodeRabbit, CI, and GitHub review are external checks. They supplement internal reviewer agents; they do not replace them.
- Contributors may open a draft PR while work or review is ongoing. Do not mark
  it ready for merge until applicable internal reviewers have run and valid
  findings are addressed or documented.
- Do not merge a PR unless the user explicitly approves that specific PR for merge.
- Any push invalidates affected internal evidence and stale GitHub approval.
  Fetch the PR head again after all checks and reviews finish. The most recent
  reviewable push requires approval from an eligible human other than its
  pusher, and every review conversation must be resolved before merge.
- New or materially changed backend subsystems must remain at or above 90
  percent test coverage. Until the dedicated global-coverage work reaches 90
  percent, CI must also preserve the current repository-wide 78 percent
  baseline and may not reduce it.

## Done Criteria

Before reporting completion:

- run a stale wording scan
- check markdown links
- assess `docs/roadmap_status.md` in every PR before marking it ready. If the
  change affects a capability, its exposure, completed work, remaining scope,
  or next dependency, update the affected roadmap sections in that same PR to
  reflect its intended merged outcome. Reconcile again after incorporating
  relevant changes from `main`. If there is no roadmap impact, state why in
  the PR; do not make a no-op roadmap edit. Do not defer an affected roadmap
  update to a separate post-merge PR. Do not treat planned/open work as already
  delivered on `main`.
- Reconcile each affected capability across the roadmap's executive summary,
  scoreboard, dependency diagram, remaining gates and trace references, plus
  its current initiative overview/change record and index next boundary.
  Compare with merged owners, routes and tests: implemented, publicly exposed
  and deployed are different claims. Preserve every supported policy branch
  in summaries and diagrams; do not imply a new dependency by omitting one.
  Keep summaries short and link detailed evidence instead of repeating change
  histories. Update only affected claims in the same PR; this is a review
  responsibility, not a new gate, status file or post-merge reconciliation step.
- verify the local XLSX has one sheet only when local sheet exports are present
- verify the current Workstream definition appears in README and local sheet exports when local sheet exports are present
- update related docs/templates and local sheet exports together when the roadmap changes
- run applicable internal sub-agent reviewers and resolve or explicitly document every valid finding
- confirm no sub-agent sessions remain open
- update relevant plans, contracts, or review notes when they materially help
  future contributors; do not create process artifacts solely to satisfy a gate
