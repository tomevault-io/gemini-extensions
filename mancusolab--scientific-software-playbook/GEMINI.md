## Scientific Software Playbook (Codex Native)

Audience and intent:
1. This file is for agents and contributors developing this repository itself.
2. It defines implementation-facing contracts, internal workflow rules, and source-of-truth plugin paths.
3. For user-facing installation and usage guidance on GitHub, use `README.md`.

Implementation-language scope:
1. This repository is currently tuned for Python/JAX scientific software workflows.
2. Additional implementation languages are currently out of scope for workflow contracts, house-style guidance, and reviewer expectations unless explicitly added later.

This repository supports one operational mode:

1. Global install mode (install into `CODEX_HOME` and run workflows directly in downstream projects).

Scope note: this repository hosts four plugins:
1. `scientific-plan-execute`
2. `scientific-research`
3. `scientific-house-style`
4. `scientific-agent-tools`

Operational workflow remains centered on `scientific-plan-execute`.

Dependency contract:
1. `scientific-plan-execute` is required for orchestration flow.
2. `scientific-research` is required for external-fact validation gates and research workflows.
3. `scientific-house-style` is required for workflow execution and review gates.
4. `scripts/install-codex-home.sh` auto-adds `scientific-research` and `scientific-house-style` when `scientific-plan-execute` is selected.
5. Required house-style skills must be resolvable at runtime:
- `jax-equinox-numerics`
- `jax-project-engineering`
- `functional-core-imperative-shell`
- `python-module-design`
6. Mandatory scientific correctness constraints remain in `scientific-plan-execute`:
   - `simulation-for-inference-validation`
7. `scientific-house-style` should carry reusable implementation-style guidance, while `scientific-plan-execute` enforces orchestration and hard-stop gates.
8. `scientific-agent-tools` is optional maintainer tooling for authoring plugins, skills, agents, and repository context files. It is not required for downstream scientific workflow execution.

Breaking-change contract:
1. Repository-root compatibility links are removed.
2. Plugin-scoped paths under `plugins/` are the only supported source-of-truth paths.

Execution delegates:
1. `scientific-task-implementor-fast`
2. `scientific-task-bug-fixer`
3. `scientific-test-analyst`

Review delegates:
1. `scientific-code-reviewer`
2. `scientific-architecture-reviewer`
3. `numerics-interface-auditor`
4. `scientific-cli-api-reviewer`
5. `scientific-inference-algorithm-reviewer`

Research delegates:
1. `codebase-investigator`
2. `internet-researcher`
3. `remote-code-researcher`
4. `combined-researcher`
5. `scientific-literature-researcher`

Simulation delegate:
1. `scientific-simulation-designer`

Maintenance delegate:
1. `project-claude-librarian`

Script policy:
1. User-facing script usage is limited to `scripts/install-codex-home.sh`.
2. All other scripts are internal and agent-invoked from installed plugin paths.

Agent-definition contract:
1. Every `plugins/scientific-plan-execute/agents/*.md` definition must include `## Mandatory First Actions`.
2. `## Mandatory First Actions` must appear before `## Responsibilities`.
3. `## Mandatory First Actions` must be split into:
   - required skills that must be loaded first
   - additional skills loaded only when scope indicates they apply
   - fail action: stop and report `blocked` when required skills cannot be loaded

Handoff snippet contract:
1. Workflow handoff snippets must use a consistent 3-step structure:
   - copy command
   - start fresh context (recommended)
   - paste/run command in fresh session
2. Handoff snippets must include both runtime forms when applicable:
   - Claude Code command wrapper (for example `/scientific-plan-execute:start-design-plan`, `/scientific-plan-execute:start-implementation-plan`, `/scientific-plan-execute:execute-implementation-plan`)
   - Codex skill/command form (for example `$starting-a-design-plan`, `$starting-an-implementation-plan`, `$executing-an-implementation-plan`)

## Global Install Mode (Required)

Install globally:

```bash
bash scripts/install-codex-home.sh --force
```

Optional selective install:

```bash
bash scripts/install-codex-home.sh --plugin scientific-plan-execute --force
bash scripts/install-codex-home.sh --plugin scientific-research --force
bash scripts/install-codex-home.sh --plugin scientific-house-style --force
bash scripts/install-codex-home.sh --plugin scientific-agent-tools --force
```

Run a downstream project:

1. Open the target project root in Codex.
2. Choose entrypoint with `using-plan-and-execute` (or `/scientific-plan-execute:start-plan-and-execute` in Claude Code), then continue with the suggested workflow skill/command.

## Workflow

1. Choose workflow entrypoint with `using-plan-and-execute` (or `/scientific-plan-execute:start-plan-and-execute` in Claude Code).
2. For general design requests, start with `starting-a-design-plan` (or `/scientific-plan-execute:start-design-plan` in Claude Code). Use `new-design-plan` when plan scaffolding is needed directly.
3. Run `scientific-kickoff` only when model provenance, model selection, or existing-codebase parity targets must be established before design can proceed. In those cases choose exactly one model path:
   - `provided-model` (user-supplied model/update rules), or
   - `suggested-model` (literature-backed model candidates + explicit user selection), or
   - `existing-codebase-port` (source-pinned local directory or GitHub URL with parity targets).
   - when `existing-codebase-port` is selected, run `scientific-codebase-investigation-pass` and capture file-level findings before approval.
4. If the model/software contract is already established and the request is a scoped feature or iteration, skip kickoff and proceed directly to `starting-a-design-plan`.
5. Pass kickoff output (`.scientific/kickoff.md`) into `starting-a-design-plan`; design orchestration must ingest kickoff state/evidence when present.
6. Set required workflow states before approval:
   - `model_path_decided: yes`
   - `codebase_investigation_complete_if_port: yes|n/a`
   - `simulation_contract_complete_if_in_scope: yes|n/a`
7. Define simulation scope for inference validation:
   - use `simulation-for-inference-validation` when simulation-based checks are required.
8. Validate in review phase with `validate-design-plan` (`phase=in-review`).
9. Approve only after explicit user sign-off using `set-design-plan-status` (`approved-for-implementation`).
10. Create implementation phases and traceability with `starting-an-implementation-plan` (or `/scientific-plan-execute:start-implementation-plan` in Claude Code).
11. Execute phase-by-phase with `executing-an-implementation-plan` (or `/scientific-plan-execute:execute-implementation-plan` in Claude Code).
12. During phase execution, apply layer skills in order when relevant:
   - `jax-equinox-numerics` (from `scientific-house-style`)
   - `polars-data-engineering` (from `scientific-house-style`) for Polars/LazyFrame/DataFrame/adapter-boundary work
   - `test-driven-development` for behavior-changing work
   - `systematic-debugging` for failing tests or persistent blockers
   - `using-git-worktrees` when branch/worktree isolation is required
13. Before phase or branch completion:
   - run `requesting-code-review` for reviewer/fix closure to zero findings
   - run `verification-before-completion` to ensure fresh, command-level completion evidence

## Hard Stops

1. No implementation before explicit design-plan approval.
2. If model artifacts exist, mathematical sanity checks are required.
3. If explicit update rules or inference-engine choices are in scope, the numerical engine strategy must be documented.
4. Approval transitions must pass strict readiness validation.
5. Completion claims require TDD evidence and fresh verification output.
6. Implementation execution requires AC-to-task-to-test traceability.
7. Architecture approval requires explicit model-path decision:
   - concrete model sources/update rules for `provided-model`
   - literature-backed model evidence plus user selection for `suggested-model`
   - source pin plus behavior/parity inventory for `existing-codebase-port`
   - completed `scientific-codebase-investigation-pass` findings with file-level evidence for `existing-codebase-port`
8. If simulation-based validation is in scope, architecture approval requires an explicit synthetic-data validation contract aligned to inferential assumptions.
9. Architecture approval requires required workflow states:
   - `model_path_decided: yes`
   - `codebase_investigation_complete_if_port: yes|n/a` (as applicable)
   - `simulation_contract_complete_if_in_scope: yes|n/a` (as applicable)
10. If CLI/API surfaces change during implementation, `scientific-cli-api-reviewer` gating is required before phase completion.
11. If inference-algorithm behavior changes during implementation, `scientific-inference-algorithm-reviewer` gating is required before phase completion.
12. If multiple independently loaded tabular sources feed numerics, architecture and implementation must specify explicit key-based reconciliation (join type, duplicate/missing-key handling, deterministic row-order policy, and reconciliation counts) before array/PyTree conversion.
