# Repository Guidelines

The project you are currently working on is called goml.

goml is a statically typed language with syntax similar to Rust, but it includes garbage collection (GC) and compiles to Go, so it does not require lifetime annotations and has no ownership system. In essence, it is closer in nature to OCaml or ML (Meta Language).

In goml, top-level functions must have fully explicit type signatures, and only top-level functions support generic type parameters. Generics are denoted using square brackets. Closures can be defined within functions, but they must have a single concrete type — goml does not include let-polymorphism (a.k.a. let-generalization). goml also supports defining traits, as well as enums and structs similar to Rust, and allows user-defined traits.

The generated Go code does not include generics — goml performs monomorphization by instantiating its own generic function calls. The generated code also does not contain Go closures — goml applies lambda lifting by performing lambda lifting (via lambda lifting) on its local functions.

The file extension for goml source files is `.gom`.

## Project Snapshot
- Go/Rust-inspired language frontend lowers through `lexer → parser → CST → AST → HIR → typed AST → Core -> Mono -> Lift → ANF` before emitting Go (`crates/compiler/src/go`).
- The CLI driver in `crates/goml/src/main.rs` handles both project-level commands and compiler subcommands; regression tests in `crates/compiler/src/tests` compare every IR stage and execute the Go output.
- The `webapp` folder hosts a Vite/React playground using Wasm bindings from `crates/wasm-app`; it can display each IR stage while execution is stubbed out.
- `typer/name_resolution.rs` should only handle AST → HIR lowering plus pure name resolution and visibility metadata; avoid making decisions that depend on `GlobalTypeEnv` or type information. Cross-module export filtering happens at package/interface construction time.
- `typer/check.rs` should only handle HIR → TAST type inference, checking, and constraint generation; avoid name-resolution responsibilities such as "fallback resolution paths" or cross-package name lookup.
- Any "ambiguity" should produce recoverable diagnostics; never `panic!` inside env/lookup. When multiple candidates exist, return `None` and report the error at a higher level.


## ANF IR and Join Points

The ANF (A-Normal Form) IR is the last intermediate representation before Go code generation. It lives in `crates/compiler/src/anf.rs` and is produced by the `anf_file` pass from the Lift IR.

### Core Data Types

```
Block { binds: Vec<Bind>, term: Term }
```
A block is a sequence of bindings followed by a terminal. This is the fundamental unit of ANF.

- **`Bind::Let(LetBind)`** — `let x = expr in ...` — binds a value expression to a local variable.
- **`Bind::Join(JoinBind)`** — `join k(params) { body } in ...` — declares a non-recursive join point (a local continuation).
- **`Bind::JoinRec(Vec<JoinBind>)`** — `joinrec { join k(params) { body } } in ...` — declares mutually recursive join points (used for loops).

Terminal terms (`Term`):
- **`Return(imm)`** — return a value from the function.
- **`Jump { target, args }`** — jump to a join point, passing arguments.
- **`If { cond, then_, else_ }`** — conditional branch; each branch is a `Block`.
- **`Match { scrut, arms, default }`** — pattern match; each arm body is a `Block`.
- **`Unreachable`** — marks dead code.

### What Are Join Points?

Join points are local continuations that represent "where control flow merges." They are the ANF equivalent of phi nodes in SSA, but are more structured — they have parameters (like function arguments) and a body.

**Key insight**: join points are NOT functions. They cannot escape their scope, are always called in tail position via `Jump`, and are guaranteed to be called exactly in the lexical scope where they are defined.

### How GoML Source Maps to ANF Join Points

**if-else expressions** (when used as expressions or with code after them):
```
// GoML source:
let result = if cond { a } else { b };
use(result)

// ANF:
join k(result) { use(result) } in    // k is the continuation after the if
if cond {
    jump k(a)                         // both branches jump to k
} else {
    jump k(b)
}
```

**Nested if-else** chains produce nested joins:
```
// GoML source:
let r = if c1 { "a" } else if c2 { "b" } else { "c" };

// ANF:
join k_outer(r) { ... } in
if c1 {
    jump k_outer("a")
} else {
    join k_inner(tmp) { jump k_outer(tmp) } in
    if c2 { jump k_inner("b") } else { jump k_inner("c") }
}
```

**match expressions** produce similar patterns — all arms jump to the same continuation join.

**while loops** lower to `JoinRec`:
```
// GoML source:
while ref_get(i) < limit {
    body;
}

// ANF:
join exit() { ... } in
joinrec {
    join loop() {
        let cond = ref_get(i) < limit in
        if cond {
            <body binds>
            jump loop()           // continue → self-jump
        } else {
            jump exit()           // break → jump to exit
        }
    }
} in
jump loop()
```

### Go Code Generation from ANF (`crates/compiler/src/go/compile.rs`)

The Go emitter produces structured code (if/else, switch, for) — never goto/label. It works by recognizing patterns in the ANF:

**Pattern 1 — Continuation join**: When all branches of an `If` or `Match` jump to the same join `k`, the emitter outputs the if/switch with only argument assignments in each branch, then emits `k`'s body AFTER the if/switch as straight-line code. This is the most common pattern.

**Pattern 2 — While loop**: When a `JoinRec` has a single member whose body is `if cond { <body>; jump self() } else { jump exit() }`, it emits `for { if !cond { break }; <body> }`. The `terminates_at` helper checks whether a branch eventually reaches the self-jump (through arbitrary let-binds and nested joins), not just immediate self-jumps.

**Pattern 3 — Inline join at Jump**: When a `Jump` targets a join that is NOT a pending continuation (e.g., a join defined in an outer scope), its body is inlined at the jump site.

Key functions in the emitter:
- `compile_fn` — entry point; builds a flat `JoinEnv` of all joins, then calls `compile_block_structured`.
- `build_join_env` / `collect_joins_from_block` — recursively collects all non-while-loop joins into a flat lookup table. While-loop `JoinRec` members are excluded.
- `compile_block_structured` — walks `binds` sequentially, collects `pending_joins` from `Bind::Join`, compiles `Bind::JoinRec` as while loops, then dispatches the terminal.
- `compile_term_with_continuations` — checks if all branches target the same pending join (via `all_branches_jump_to`); if so, emits the branching construct with arg assignments, then emits the join body.
- `compile_while_loop` — emits `for { if !cond { break }; body }`. Adds the loop's `JoinId` to `continue_targets` in `JoinEnv` so that self-jumps inside the body are compiled as implicit continue (empty statement at end of loop iteration).
- `compile_term_leaf` — fallback for terms that don't match a continuation pattern; inlines join bodies at `Jump` sites.

### Design Invariants

- The `JoinEnv` is a flat `HashMap<JoinId, JoinBind>` built once per function. While-loop `JoinRec` members are NOT in `JoinEnv` — they are compiled directly by `compile_while_loop`.
- `continue_targets: HashSet<JoinId>` tracks which `JoinId`s represent the current enclosing while loop. A `Jump` to a continue target emits nothing (the `for` loop naturally continues).
- Join bodies form a DAG (except `JoinRec` which is handled specially). The emitter inlines join bodies at their use sites, which is safe because each non-recursive join is used at most once in the continuation position and any remaining uses are in tail position.
- DCE (`crates/compiler/src/go/dce.rs`) runs on the Go AST after emission. Since the structured emitter produces no goto/label, DCE is always enabled.

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- Rust workspace in `crates/*`:
  - `lexer`, `parser`, `cst`, `ast`, `compiler` (core pipeline and tests), `wasm-app` (Rust → Wasm bindings), `lsp-server` (Language Server Protocol).
- Frontend in `webapp` (Vite + React + TypeScript) consuming `crates/wasm-app/pkg`.
- VS Code extension in `editors/vscode/` consuming LSP server binary.
- CI/dev helpers in `.justfile`. Build artifacts in `target/` and `webapp/dist/`.

## Project Configuration (`goml.toml`)

GoML projects use a `goml.toml` file for project configuration, similar to Cargo.toml in Rust.

A **crate** is the top-level compilation unit. The crate root has a `goml.toml` with a `[crate]` section. Child modules are declared from source with `mod name;` and are loaded from `name.gom` or `name/mod.gom`.

### Crate Root Example
```toml
[crate]
name = "myapp"
kind = "bin"
root = "main.gom"

[dependencies]
"alice::http" = "1.2.0"
```

### Crate Module Example
```goml
mod utils;

fn main() -> unit {
    string_println(crate::utils::message())
}
```

```text
utils/mod.gom
```

### Library Crate Example
```toml
[crate]
name = "mylib"
kind = "lib"
root = "lib.gom"
```

### Fields
| Field          | Required | Default | Description |
| -------------- | -------- | ------- | ----------- |
| `crate.name`   | Yes      | -       | Crate name; registry crates must match the module name |
| `crate.kind`   | No       | -       | `bin` or `lib`; controls default root candidates |
| `crate.root`   | No       | -       | Path to the root `.gom` file relative to `goml.toml` |
| `dependencies` | No       | `{}`    | Third-party dependencies keyed by `"owner::module"` with minimum version `X.Y.Z` |

### Project Discovery
- The LSP and CLI search upward from the current file to find `goml.toml` with a `[crate]` section.
- If `crate.root` is set, it is the compilation entry point.
- Otherwise `crate.kind = "bin"` tries `src/main.gom` then `main.gom`; `crate.kind = "lib"` tries `src/lib.gom` then `lib.gom`.
- Third-party dependencies are declared only in the crate root `goml.toml`.
- Child modules are discovered only from explicit `mod name;` declarations.
- The old source `package ...;` declaration and old manifest `[module]` / `[package]` format are unsupported.

### Current Visibility Semantics
- Cross-module access is filtered by top-level item visibility. A module can use another module's `pub fn`, `pub struct`, `pub enum`, and `pub trait`; private top-level items are not exported to dependent modules.
- Private helpers remain usable inside their defining module, including from public wrapper functions in that module.
- `pub mod` / private `mod` visibility is parsed and recorded, but full ancestor-module path privacy is not enforced yet. In practice, mark the item itself `pub` when another module needs it.
- Struct fields and `impl` methods do not yet have fine-grained visibility enforcement. Do not rely on that as a long-term API guarantee.
- Interface files and external dependency artifacts export only public top-level API. If a test or fixture calls `crate::foo::bar()`, `bar` must be declared `pub`.

## Package Management

GoML currently uses a mono-repo registry model for third-party dependencies.

### Registry Layout
- The registry is a git repository with an `index.toml` at the repo root
- Each published module version lives at `/<owner>/<module>/<version>/`
- Each published module version must include its own `goml.toml`
- The module root inside the registry must declare `[crate] name = "<module>"`
- `index.toml` is the authoritative package index; package management reads the index instead of scanning the full registry tree

### Dependency Semantics
- Dependencies are declared in `[dependencies]` using `"owner::module" = "X.Y.Z"`
- Versions use strict semver `X.Y.Z` only; prerelease and build metadata are not supported
- Version values are minimum version requirements, not exact pins
- Resolution uses Go-style MVS: the selected version for each module is the minimum available version satisfying the highest required minimum in the graph
- Registry entries are treated as immutable after publication
- There is currently no `goml.lock`

### User Config And Cache
- Global GoML state lives under `~/.goml`
- `GOML_HOME` overrides the default `~/.goml` location
- `~/.goml/config.toml` stores the default registry URL under `[registry].default`
- `~/.goml/cache/registry` stores the cloned mono-repo registry cache
- `goml update` creates `~/.goml/config.toml` if it does not exist yet

### CLI Commands
- `goml update` clones or fast-forwards the registry cache into `~/.goml/cache/registry`
- `goml add owner::module` adds the latest indexed version requirement to the current crate root `goml.toml`
- `goml add owner::module@X.Y.Z` adds or updates an explicit minimum version requirement
- `goml remove owner::module` removes that dependency from the current crate root `goml.toml`
- `goml update`, `goml add`, and `goml remove` all support `--local-registry <path>` to use a local git repo or registry checkout instead of the default configured registry
- `goml add` and `goml remove` locate the crate root by searching upward for `goml.toml` with a `[crate]` section

### External Module Namespaces
- Registry source layout reuses normal crate/module layout.
- External root modules are imported by owner-qualified module path, for example `use alice::http;`
- External child modules use the module namespace, for example `use alice::http::client;`
- Trait imports follow the same rule, for example `use alice::http::Show;` and `use alice::http::client::Show;`
- Internally, external modules are mapped to logical names such as `http` and `client`
- Different owners cannot appear in the same resolved graph with the same module name; `alice::http` and `dave::http` are rejected together because compiled logical names are still based on the module namespace.

### Build, Check, And LSP Behavior
- `goml check`, `goml build`, compiler queries, and LSP requests all resolve and typecheck third-party dependencies
- Third-party source files remain in the registry cache under `~/.goml/cache/registry`
- Project outputs continue to be written under the current project's `target/goml`
- External dependency artifacts are materialized under `target/goml/check/deps/<owner>/<module>/<version>/` and `target/goml/build/deps/<owner>/<module>/<version>/`
- Interfaces and dependency environments expose only public top-level API; current-package codegen still uses the package's full internal environment so private helpers compile normally.
- Go-to-definition, hover, completion, and other query features can resolve into cached third-party source files

## VS Code LSP Extension

### Design Philosophy
- Reuse existing compiler infrastructure: the LSP server delegates to `crates/compiler/src/query.rs` which already powers the Monaco web editor.
- Full compilation on every request: no incremental/salsa-based caching yet; each hover/completion triggers a full typecheck of the entry crate and its dependencies.
- Crate/module aware: the LSP discovers modules from `[crate]` manifests and explicit `mod` declarations, then still routes them through the internal package graph while that transition layer exists.

### Build Commands
- `just build-lsp`: Build release LSP binary (`target/release/goml-lsp`).
- `just install-lsp`: Build and copy binary to `editors/vscode/bin/`.
- `just vscode-ext`: Full build (LSP + extension TypeScript).

### Development Workflow
1. Build LSP: `cargo build -p lsp-server --release`
2. Copy binary: `cp target/release/goml-lsp editors/vscode/bin/`
3. Install deps: `cd editors/vscode && pnpm install`
4. Compile TS: `pnpm run compile`
5. Press F5 in VS Code to launch Extension Development Host.

### Configuration
- `goml.serverPath`: Custom path to `goml-lsp` binary (defaults to bundled or PATH lookup).
- `goml.trace.server`: Trace LSP communication (`off`, `messages`, `verbose`).

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- Rust build: `cargo build` (workspace). Specific crate: `cargo build -p parser`.
- Rust tests: `cargo test`
- CLI: use `cargo run -p goml -- new <project_name>` to scaffold a bin crate with a root module and a `lib` child module; use `cargo run -p goml -- check` and `cargo run -p goml -- build` for project-level workflows (they discover crate modules and currently orchestrate the internal check/build/link units); use `cargo run -p goml -- check --dry-run` and `cargo run -p goml -- build --dry-run` to print planned subcommands without executing them; use `cargo run -p goml -- compiler run-single <file.gom>` for single-file execution; use `cargo run -p goml -- compiler check|build|link ...` for separate compilation workflows; add `--dump-ast|--dump-hir|--dump-tast|--dump-core|--dump-mono|--dump-lift|--dump-anf|--dump-go` to `compiler run-single` to print IR stages before execution.
- Lint (Rust): `just clippy` (equivalent to `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features --locked -- -D warnings`).
- Format (Rust): `cargo fmt`.
- Wasm build: `wasm-pack build ./crates/wasm-app`.
- Webapp dev: `just start` (build Wasm, then `pnpm install` and `pnpm run dev` in `webapp`).
- Webapp build/preview: `pnpm -C webapp build` and `pnpm -C webapp preview`.
- CI locally: cargo check, test, fmt, clippy.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- do not write any comments, instead, write simple, clear and self-explanatory code
- Rust (edition 2024): format with `rustfmt`; deny clippy warnings. Use snake_case for functions/modules, CamelCase for types, SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE for consts.
- TypeScript/React: 2‑space indent; PascalCase components; named exports preferred. Lint with `pnpm -C webapp lint`.
- Keep modules small and focused; avoid cross-crate leakage. Public APIs must be explicitly marked `pub`; the crate root may be `main.gom`, `lib.gom`, or the path configured by `crate.root`.

## Testing Guidelines
- We use expect-test, there are two basic commands:
  - `cargo test` run test to match golden snapshots
  - `env UPDATE_EXPECT=1 cargo test` to update snapshots
- Aim for fast, deterministic tests; cover parsing/typing edges with minimal fixtures when relevant.

### Single-File Pipeline Tests
- Each pipeline test case is in its own directory under `crates/compiler/src/tests/pipeline/`. Directory names follow the pattern `NNN/` (e.g., `000/`, `001/`) or `NNN_description/` (e.g., `007_expr_pattern_matching/`, `025_missing_match/`).
- Each test directory contains:
  - `main.gom` - the input source file
  - `main.gom.cst`, `main.gom.ast`, `main.gom.hir`, `main.gom.tast`, `main.gom.core`, `main.gom.mono`, `main.gom.anf`, `main.gom.go` - expected IR outputs at each compilation stage
  - `main.gom.out` - expected execution output
- You can quick check a test case with: `cargo run -p goml -- compiler run-single crates/compiler/src/tests/pipeline/001/main.gom`
- You should NEVER manually modify the generated files (`.cst`, `.ast`, `.hir`, `.tast`, `.core`, `.mono`, `.anf`, `.go`, `.out`). The only way to update them is by running: `env UPDATE_EXPECT=1 cargo test`.
- When asked to "add pipeline tests", create a new directory (e.g., `063/` or `063_feature_name/`) under `crates/compiler/src/tests/pipeline/` with a `main.gom` file, then run `env UPDATE_EXPECT=1 cargo test` to generate the expected outputs.

### Multi-Module Tests
- Multi-module tests are located in `crates/compiler/src/tests/module/`. They test crate/module source layout while the compiler still maps those modules through the internal package graph.
- Each project directory follows the pattern `projectNNN/` (e.g., `project001/`, `project002/`) or `projectNNN_description/`.
- Structure of a multi-module project:
  - `goml.toml` - crate configuration with `[crate]`
  - `main.gom` or the configured crate root - declares top-level modules with `mod Name;`
  - `Name/mod.gom` or `Name.gom` - module source files
  - `main.gom.out` - expected execution output
- Module conventions:
  - Source files do not declare `package`
  - The crate root contains the `fn main()` entry point for bin crate tests
  - The crate root declares every top-level module needed by the project, including modules only used by sibling modules
  - Cross-module APIs must be declared `pub`; private top-level items should only be used inside the defining module
  - Cross-module references use `crate::Name::member` syntax (e.g., `crate::Lib::Color::Red`, `crate::Math::Pair`)
  - Trait method syntax `x.method(...)` for non-`dyn` values is enabled by `use crate::Name::Trait` (builtin traits like `Show` are in the prelude and do not require `use`)
- To add a new multi-module test:
  1. Create a new directory under `crates/compiler/src/tests/module/` (e.g., `project011/`)
  2. Create `goml.toml` with a `[crate]` section
  3. Create the crate root file with `mod` declarations and `fn main()`
  4. Create module files as `Name/mod.gom` or `Name.gom`
  5. Run `env UPDATE_EXPECT=1 cargo test` to generate the expected output file
- Note: Multi-module tests run crate module discovery and project execution, and only generate `.out` files, not intermediate IR stages like pipeline tests

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Prefer Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `chore:`). Be concise and imperative: "add parser error for ...".
- PRs: include a clear description, linked issues, and before/after notes or screenshots for web UI changes.
- Required: run cargo check, test, fmt, clippy locally; ensure no clippy or fmt diffs.
- If a change updates expect snapshots, use two commits: first the logic change, then a snapshot-only commit generated via `env UPDATE_EXPECT=1 cargo test` (e.g. `chore(tests): update snapshots`). If the change also adds new tests, use three commits: (1) logic, (2) the new test source files, (3) snapshots.
- Always run tests before notifying the user that a task is complete.

## Environment & Tooling
- Requirements: Rust toolchain, `wasm-pack`, Node 18+, `pnpm`.
- If adding crates, update workspace in `Cargo.toml`; keep inter‑crate deps via `[workspace.dependencies]`.

## GoML Introduction

### Lexical Structure and Literals

* Primitive types: `bool`, `unit`/`()`, `int8/16/32/64`, `uint8/16/32/64`, `float32/float64`, `string`, `char`.
* Literals: boolean, integer/unsigned/floating-point, string, and char literals.
  * Char literals use single quotes, e.g. `'a'`, and support escapes like `'\n'` and `'\u0041'`.
  * `char` represents a Unicode scalar value and compiles to Go `rune` (an `int32` code point).
* String concatenation with `+` is supported. Multiline strings continue lines with leading `\\` and may contain quotes and backslashes (see `062_multiline_string`).
* Tuples `(a, b, c)` and the wildcard `_` are commonly used in bindings and pattern matching.

### Bindings and Scope

* `let name = expr;` allows shadowing of the same name. Type annotations are supported, e.g. `let x: int32 = 1;`. `let _ = expr;` discards the result.
* `let` supports pattern destructuring: tuples, struct fields, enum constructors, and wildcards can be mixed.

### Functions and Closures

* Top-level function declaration: `fn name(params) -> Ret { ... }`. Top-level functions must have explicit signatures; if the return type is omitted, it defaults to `unit`.
* Only top-level functions may declare generic parameters, using square brackets, e.g. `fn id[T](x: T) -> T`.
* Top-level function generics may add trait bounds per parameter: `fn f[T: A + B + C](x: T) -> ...`. `A + B` is only valid in these generic bounds (not in type annotations/param/return types, and not in `dyn`).
* Function types are written as `(A, B) -> C` and can be stored in arrays, passed as arguments, or returned.
* Closures are written as `|args| expr` or `|| { ... }`. They can capture outer variables, support multiple levels of nesting, and can return closures.

### Structs, Enums, and Fields

* Structs: `struct Name { field: Type, ... }`. Construction supports key–value syntax or field shorthand. Field access uses `value.field`, and fields can be used for update reconstruction.
* Enums: `enum Name { Variant, Variant(T1, T2), ... }`, with support for generics. Constructors may be uppercase or lowercase; namespaced access `Enum::Variant` avoids conflicts.
* Pattern matching supports field patterns, shorthand, and wildcards for structs; enum matching can destructure payloads or match constructors directly.

### Built-in Containers and References

* Fixed-length arrays `[T; N]`, literals `[1, 2, 3]`, accessed via `array_get/array_set`.
* Mutable references `Ref[T]`: created with `ref(x)`, accessed and updated via `ref_get/ref_set`; nested references are supported.
* Built-in growable vectors `Vec[T]`: `vec_new/vec_push/vec_get/vec_len`.
* Built-in read-only slices `Slice[T]`: `slice/slice_get/slice_len/slice_sub`.
  * `slice(vec, start, end)` creates a bounded view over `Vec[T]`.
  * `Slice[T]` methods: `get`, `len`, `sub`.
  * Current model is read-only view type; no `slice_set`/`push` on `Slice[T]`.
* Built-in `string` supports method syntax for common operations.
  * Prefer `s.len()` and `s.get(i)` over `string_len(s)` and `string_get(s, i)` in tests and examples.
  * Prefer method syntax such as `x.to_string()` when a builtin type or in-scope trait already exposes it.

### Control Flow and Expressions

* `if ... else ...` is an expression; branches may be nested. `while cond { ... }` loops return `unit`.
* Boolean and arithmetic operators: `+ - * /`, unary negation, logical `! && ||`, and comparisons `== != < > <= >=`.
* `match expr { pattern => expr, ... }`: patterns are tried in order. Patterns include literals, tuples, structs, enums, bindings, and the wildcard `_`. Missing coverage results in an error (e.g., unmatched destructuring).

### Traits and `impl`

* `trait T { fn method(Self, ...) -> ...; }` defines an interface. Implementations use `impl Trait for Type { ... }`, including for specific generic instances.
* Inherent implementations `impl Type { ... }` provide associated functions and methods.
* Invocation styles: method syntax `value.method(...)`, or associated syntax `Type::method(value, ...)` / `Trait::method(value, ...)`.
  * For trait methods on non-`dyn` values, `x.method(...)` works when the trait is in scope via `use crate::Module::Trait` or `use owner::module::Trait` for external dependencies (builtin traits like `Show` are in the prelude), otherwise use UFCS like `Trait::method(x, ...)`.
* When multiple trait bounds provide the same method name for a type parameter, `x.foo()` is ambiguous and requires UFCS disambiguation (e.g. `A::foo(x)`).
* Trait objects: `dyn Trait` is a first-class type for dynamic dispatch.
  * Coercion: when the expected type is `dyn Trait`, a value of concrete type `T` is implicitly converted if there is a visible `impl Trait for T`.
  * Calling: `Trait::method(x, ...)` works for both concrete `x: T` (static dispatch) and `x: dyn Trait` (dynamic dispatch).
  * Object safety (current): the receiver must be the first parameter and be exactly `Self`; `Self` is not allowed in other parameters or the return type.
  * Limitations (current): trait method call via `x.method(...)` is not supported for `dyn Trait` (use `Trait::method(x, ...)`); pattern matching on `dyn Trait` is not supported; `dyn TraitA + TraitB` and explicit `as dyn Trait` syntax are not implemented.

### Notes on `char`

* Codegen: goml `char` lowers to Go `rune`.
* Printing: `char` implements `ToString`; `c.to_string()` returns a `string` representation of the code point.
* Pattern matching: `match` supports `char` scrutinees and `char` literal patterns.

### Concurrency and Side Effects

* `go expr;` starts concurrent execution, commonly used with zero-argument closures.
* Common built-ins for I/O and debugging: `string_print/string_println`, and `_to_string` for basic types or derived `to_string`.

### Attributes and Derivation

* Attributes such as `#[derive(ToString)]`, `#[derive(Eq)]`, and `#[derive(Hash)]` automatically generate methods; applicable to structs and enums.

### External Interoperability

* User-defined Go FFI is not supported while the compiler is being bootstrapped.
* Only compiler-owned host hooks use `#[builtin] extern fn`; normal goml code should call those builtins instead of binding arbitrary Go symbols.

### Additional Conventions and Constraints

* Top-level functions must have explicit type signatures; generics are limited to top-level functions.
* Closures must have a single concrete type (no let-polymorphism); generics are expanded via monomorphization.
* The runtime uses garbage collection; manual ownership or lifetimes are not required.

### Builtin `HashMap`

* Builtin type: `HashMap[K, V]`, backed by generated Go runtime code and Go `map` internally.
* Builtin API: `hashmap_new`, `hashmap_get -> Option[V]`, `hashmap_set -> unit`, `hashmap_remove -> unit`, `hashmap_len -> int32`, `hashmap_contains -> bool`.
* Key requirements: `K` must have both `Hash` and `Eq`.

### Builtin `Slice`

* Builtin type: `Slice[T]`, a bounded read-only view over contiguous `Vec[T]` storage.
* Builtin API:
  * `slice(vec: Vec[T], start: int32, end: int32) -> Slice[T]`
  * `slice_get(s: Slice[T], index: int32) -> T`
  * `slice_len(s: Slice[T]) -> int32`
  * `slice_sub(s: Slice[T], start: int32, end: int32) -> Slice[T]`
* Inherent methods on `Slice[T]`: `get`, `len`, `sub`.
* Current limitation: mutable slice operations are intentionally not provided.

### Builtin traits `Eq` / `Hash`

* `trait Eq { fn eq(Self, Self) -> bool; }`
* `trait Hash { fn hash(Self) -> uint64; }`
* `Ref[T]` implements `Eq`/`Hash` by the pointed-to content (`ref_get(self)`), not pointer identity.

### Testing / snapshots gotchas

* Adding/changing builtins changes the `builtin` interface hash, which can break `crates/goml/tests/expect/cli_commands_test/*`; update via `env UPDATE_EXPECT=1 cargo test`.
* Pipeline tests under `crates/compiler/src/tests/pipeline/` must only be updated via `env UPDATE_EXPECT=1 cargo test` (never hand-edit `.cst/.ast/.hir/.tast/.core/.mono/.anf/.go/.out`).
* Visibility tests live in `crates/compiler/src/tests/visibility_test.rs`; prefer focused typecheck fixtures there when checking `pub`/private module API behavior.

### Name collisions

* Avoid defining user traits named `Eq` or `Hash` in tests/examples unless you fully qualify or rename them; the builtins now reserve these names and duplicate impls can surface as “defined in multiple packages”.
