## General (Common)

### Architecture

- Use **Vite+** as the primary toolchain.
- This repository is a pnpm workspace monorepo managed by Vite+.
- `apps/desktop` contains the Electron product and owns app runtime, IPC, renderer routes, and product-specific features.
- `packages/*` contains internal shared source packages. Packages are consumed through `exports` that point to source files; they are not bundled for app consumption and are not public external APIs. Even though consumption resolves to source files, import cross-package dependencies through normal package specifiers instead of aliases or direct source paths.
- `packages/shared` contains domain-agnostic helpers shared across workspace packages.
- `packages/ui` contains app-agnostic UI primitives, design tokens, styles, and icons.
- `packages/editor` contains reusable editor functionality and can be developed independently from the desktop app.
- `packages/mac-native` contains macOS native addons for the Electron main process.

- Put reusable workspace packages under `packages/*`; keep the Electron app under `apps/desktop`.
- Use `kebab-case` file names by default.

## Frontend

### UI Conventions

- Use the shadcn CLI to create new components when appropriate.
- Run shadcn commands from `packages/ui`; `packages/ui/components.json` is the source of truth for shadcn configuration.
- Store shadcn/Base UI source components in `packages/ui/src/components` and shared UI utilities in `packages/ui/src/lib`.
- Do not add app-specific state, routes, IPC, clients, Lingui copy, or feature/domain logic to `packages/ui`.
- Avoid modifying existing shadcn components when possible; if a change is necessary, explain the reason and expected impact.
- Use `lucide-react` for icons, and name icon wrappers with an `Icon` suffix.
- Design and test with RTL behavior in mind.

### I18n (Lingui)

- Use Lingui explicit IDs for all translatable text; IDs must stay semantic and stable. After adding or changing translatable text, run `vp run i18n:extract` to update `.po` files.
- Run `vp run i18n:check` to verify catalogs are current and shipped locales have no missing translations. `vp staged` runs this for renderer source, locale catalog, and Lingui config changes.
- The project uses `@lingui/vite-plugin`; do not compile catalogs manually. `pseudo` is for development/testing only (for example, RTL checks or long-text overflow checks), and must not be translated manually.

## Backend

### Database (Drizzle)

- Keep the SQLite schema and Drizzle runtime helpers under `apps/desktop/src/main/core/database`.
- Database access is main-process only; do not introduce renderer-side database access.

### Error Model

- Backend IPC command errors must use a flat JSON payload:

```ts
{
  code: string;
  message: string;
  details: any;
}
```

- Keep business/domain errors separate from internal/technical errors.
- Business errors must use `BUSINESS.[CODE]` naming (for example, `BUSINESS.NOT_FOUND`, `BUSINESS.INVALID_INVOKE`).
- Use `BUSINESS.INVALID_INVOKE` for command argument validation failures and include validation details in `details`.
- Map all internal errors (database, IO, runtime failures, and others) to `INTERNAL` and preserve debug context in `details` when available.

### macOS Native Addons

- Use `@fluxnotes/mac-native` for macOS Accessibility integration; do not reintroduce a spawned Electron helper app for this path.
- `packages/mac-native` uses `node-addon-api` with Swift/Objective-C++ and builds `build/Release/mac_native.node`.
- Treat `packages/mac-native/build/` and `packages/mac-native/bin/` as generated native build output; keep them ignored.
- After changing native sources or `binding.gyp`, run `vp run build:native` from `packages/mac-native` before desktop packaging.
- Keep the desktop main bundle externalizing `@fluxnotes/mac-native`; packaged apps load its CJS facade and unpacked `.node` from app resources.

## Workflow & Verification

### Contribution Policy

- Agents handling issues, pull requests, commits, or contribution-related work must read and follow `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

### Standard Verification

After any code change, run:

```bash
vp run check
vp run test
vp run package:desktop
```

### Database Schema Changes

- For database schema changes, run `vp run db:generate` before verification and commit the generated migration files.

### Spec Maintenance

- Update `AGENTS.md` promptly whenever repository conventions or infrastructure are added or changed.

## Test

- Import test APIs from `vite-plus/test`, never from `vitest`.
- Run tests with `vp run test` from both the repository root and package directories; do not run root-level `vp test`, because it bypasses package-local Vite+ configs and can break aliases, setup files, and cwd-dependent tests. `vp test` is allowed only when intentionally invoking a package-local Vite+ test runner directly.
- Do not invoke `vitest` directly.
- Use the Arrange-Act-Assert structure for readability.
- Tests must be isolated and must not depend on execution order or shared state.
- Use descriptive test names, preferably following `action state expected` or `given when then`.
- Add comments only when they clarify non-obvious intent or setup.
- Use package-local `vp test --coverage` as a reference, not as the primary quality target.
