# Build & Deploy

- Version display: `v0.4.4` for stable releases, `v0.4.4-dev` for nightly/local builds. Controlled by `--dart-define=CHANNEL=stable|nightly` (defaults to `nightly`).
- When needed, always build first, then kill the running app, then start the new build. Never kill before the build completes.
  ```
  source .env && dart fix --apply && flutter build macos --release --dart-define=GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=$GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID --dart-define=GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=$GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET --dart-define=DB_FILE_NAME=$DB_FILE_NAME && pkill -f "FinanceCopilot" 2>/dev/null; open build/macos/Build/Products/Release/FinanceCopilot.app
  ```
- Android APK build:
  ```
  source .env && flutter build apk --release --dart-define=GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=$GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID --dart-define=GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=$GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET --dart-define=GOOGLE_WEB_CLIENT_ID=$GOOGLE_WEB_CLIENT_ID --dart-define=GOOGLE_ANDROID_CLIENT_ID=$GOOGLE_ANDROID_CLIENT_ID --dart-define=DB_FILE_NAME=$DB_FILE_NAME
  ```
- OAuth credentials are in `.env` (gitignored). Never commit secrets to git.

## Android Emulator

- Available emulators: `Medium_Phone_API_35`, `Pixel_8_Pro_API_35`
- Steps (in order):
  1. Launch emulator: `flutter emulators --launch <emulator_id>`
  2. Wait for it to appear: `flutter devices` (look for `emulator-XXXX`)
  3. Build APK: `source .env && flutter build apk --release --dart-define=GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=$GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID --dart-define=GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=$GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET --dart-define=GOOGLE_WEB_CLIENT_ID=$GOOGLE_WEB_CLIENT_ID --dart-define=GOOGLE_ANDROID_CLIENT_ID=$GOOGLE_ANDROID_CLIENT_ID --dart-define=DB_FILE_NAME=$DB_FILE_NAME`
  4. Install: `flutter install -d emulator-XXXX`
  5. Launch app: `adb -s emulator-XXXX shell monkey -p net.bazzani.financecopilot -c android.intent.category.LAUNCHER 1`
- Package name is `net.bazzani.financecopilot` (NOT `com.example.finance_copilot`).
- To run a second emulator alongside an existing one, just launch it — don't kill the first. They get sequential ports (5554, 5556, ...).
- If `am start` or `monkey` fails with "Activity does not exist" on a freshly launched emulator, the emulator image is likely corrupted (e.g. EdXposed or other framework mods). Fix: kill it (`adb -s emulator-XXXX emu kill`), relaunch with `flutter emulators --launch`, and reinstall.

## Windows VM (UTM)

The Windows build runs in a **UTM** virtual machine, controlled from the Mac with the bundled `utmctl` CLI. The commands below use placeholders — substitute your own values:

| Placeholder | Meaning | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `<VM>` | UTM VM name (full name, or UUID from `utmctl list`) | `"Windows 11"` |
| `<USER>` | Windows username | `dev` |
| `<PROJECT>` | Project checkout path in the guest | `C:\Users\<USER>\dev\FinanceCopilot` |
| `<FLUTTER>` | Flutter `bin\flutter.bat` path in the guest | `C:\Users\<USER>\dev\flutter\bin\flutter.bat` |

- `utmctl` path (not on PATH): `/Applications/UTM.app/Contents/MacOS/utmctl`
- The Mac and the guest share the same `origin` git remote, so branches round-trip via GitHub. Find the guest IP with `utmctl ip-address "<VM>"` if you need direct network access.

### Critical `utmctl exec` caveats

- **No stdout/stderr is returned.** `utmctl exec` is fire-and-forget: it launches the process in the guest and returns immediately. It does NOT pipe back output and does NOT return the guest's real exit code (the host always sees exit 0 unless the *launch itself* fails, e.g. binary not found). To see ANY output you MUST redirect it to a file in the guest and pull it back with `utmctl file pull`.
- **Runs as `nt authority\system` (Session 0), not as `<USER>`.** This means: GUI apps must be launched via the scheduled-task trick (below); and `%APPDATA%`/`$env:APPDATA` resolve to SYSTEM's *own* profile, not the interactive user's — so reads that rely on those env vars come back empty. SYSTEM **can** read the interactive user's profile, but only via the **absolute** `C:\Users\<USER>\...` path. Write helper/log files to a SYSTEM-readable location such as `C:\` (the examples below use `C:\`).
- **Complex inline PowerShell gets corrupted.** `$variables` inside a `utmctl exec --cmd "powershell -Command \"...\""` are eaten by the host shell → quoting layers. For anything beyond a trivial one-liner, push a `.ps1` and run it with `--cmd "powershell.exe" "-NoProfile" "-ExecutionPolicy" "Bypass" "-File" "C:\script.ps1"`.
- **`file pull` races a still-open file.** While a command is writing to its redirect target, `file pull` fails with "The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process." This is the completion signal's inverse: poll `file pull` and treat the lock error as "still running." Append a marker line (e.g. `DONE_EXITCODE=%ERRORLEVEL%`) as the last write so a successful pull containing the marker means "finished."

### Guest `.env`

The guest checkout has its own `.env` at `<PROJECT>\.env`. It must contain the Google OAuth client IDs **and** `DB_FILE_NAME` (e.g. `DB_FILE_NAME=finance_copilot_dev.db`). Always load the full `.env` via the `for /f` loop and pass ALL dart-defines (client id/secret + web + android client ids + DB file name); unset cmd vars expand to their literal `%NAME%` text, which silently produces a wrong build, so never rely on a key being present — verify.

### Sync workflow (uses the `sync` branch)

`sync` is a throwaway branch that mirrors the Mac working copy to the guest. Force-push from the Mac, force-reset on the guest.

1. Push working copy from the Mac:
   ```
   git checkout -B sync && git add -A && git commit -m "sync" && git push -f origin sync
   ```
2. Pull it in the guest (poll the log until `SYNC_DONE` appears; lock error = still running):
   ```
   /Applications/UTM.app/Contents/MacOS/utmctl exec "<VM>" --cmd "cmd.exe" "/c" "cd /d <PROJECT> & git fetch origin > C:\fc_sync.log 2>&1 & git checkout -f sync >> C:\fc_sync.log 2>&1 & git reset --hard origin/sync >> C:\fc_sync.log 2>&1 & echo SYNC_DONE >> C:\fc_sync.log"
   /Applications/UTM.app/Contents/MacOS/utmctl file pull "<VM>" "C:\fc_sync.log"
   ```

### Build — MUST use a guest batch file (do NOT use a `&`-chained one-liner)

**Critical bug:** a single-line `cmd /c "... for /f ... do set %a=%b & flutter ... --dart-define=GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=%GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID% ..."` does NOT work. `cmd` expands every `%VAR%` on the line at **parse time — before the `for` loop runs** — so the dart-defines receive the literal text `%GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID%` (it reaches Google as `client_id=%25GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID%25` → `Error 401: invalid_client`). The build "succeeds" but bakes in placeholders. A `.bat` file is parsed/executed **line by line**, so `%VAR%` on the flutter line expands after the loop has `set` it. Always build via a batch file.

1. Kill any running instance FIRST (a running `FinanceCopilot.exe` locks `WebView2Loader.dll` in the Release dir and the build fails with `MSB3021`/`MSB3027`):
   ```
   /Applications/UTM.app/Contents/MacOS/utmctl exec "<VM>" --cmd "cmd.exe" "/c" "taskkill /F /IM FinanceCopilot.exe /T"
   ```
2. Use the repo's `tool/win_build.bat` as the guest build script. Edit the `cd` and flutter paths at the top to match your `<PROJECT>`/`<FLUTTER>`, then push it into the guest:
   ```
   cat tool/win_build.bat | /Applications/UTM.app/Contents/MacOS/utmctl file push "<VM>" "C:\win_build.bat"
   ```
   The script loads `.env`, runs the release build with all dart-defines, redirects to `C:\fc_build.log`, and appends `DONE_EXITCODE=%ERRORLEVEL%` as the completion marker. (Inside a `.bat`, the `for` variable is written `%%a`/`%%b`.)
3. Run it (fire-and-forget):
   ```
   /Applications/UTM.app/Contents/MacOS/utmctl exec "<VM>" --cmd "cmd.exe" "/c" "C:\win_build.bat"
   ```
4. Poll (≤10s sleeps): `utmctl file pull "<VM>" "C:\fc_build.log"` until it contains `DONE_EXITCODE=` (or ends with `√ Built ...Release\FinanceCopilot.exe`). A release build takes ~2–4 min. Artifact: `<PROJECT>\build\windows\x64\runner\Release\FinanceCopilot.exe`.
5. **Verify the credentials baked in** (the placeholder bug is silent). Run a check against the compiled `app.so`; expect `PLACEHOLDER_ABSENT`:
   ```powershell
   $t = [System.Text.Encoding]::ASCII.GetString([System.IO.File]::ReadAllBytes('<PROJECT>\build\windows\x64\runner\Release\data\app.so'))
   if ($t.Contains('%GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID%')) {'PLACEHOLDER_PRESENT'} else {'PLACEHOLDER_ABSENT'} | Set-Content C:\fc_check.txt
   ```

### Launch GUI app (scheduled-task trick, required because exec is Session 0/SYSTEM)

```
/Applications/UTM.app/Contents/MacOS/utmctl exec "<VM>" --cmd "cmd.exe" "/c" "schtasks /Create /TN LaunchFC /TR \"<PROJECT>\build\windows\x64\runner\Release\FinanceCopilot.exe\" /SC ONCE /ST 00:00 /F /RU <USER> & schtasks /Run /TN LaunchFC & schtasks /Delete /TN LaunchFC /F"
```
Verify it's running: `utmctl exec ... cmd /c "tasklist > C:\fc_proc.txt 2>&1"` then `utmctl file pull ... fc_proc.txt` and look for `FinanceCopilot.exe` in `Console` session 1.

### Read the app log (the GUI app holds it open for writing)

The Windows log lives at `C:\Users\<USER>\AppData\Roaming\FinanceCopilot\FinanceCopilot\app.log` — note the path is **`FinanceCopilot\FinanceCopilot`** (Flutter's `getApplicationSupportDirectory()` = `%APPDATA%\<OrgName>\<AppName>`), NOT the `net.bazzani.financecopilot` bundle id. Two gotchas:
- SYSTEM's `%APPDATA%` is not the user's, so use the absolute `C:\Users\<USER>\...` path.
- The running app keeps the file open, so `Get-Content` returns nothing — must open with `FileShare.ReadWrite`.

Use the repo's `tool/win_read_log.ps1` (handles both). Push and run it, passing the user's absolute log path:
```
cat tool/win_read_log.ps1 | /Applications/UTM.app/Contents/MacOS/utmctl file push "<VM>" "C:\win_read_log.ps1"
/Applications/UTM.app/Contents/MacOS/utmctl exec "<VM>" --cmd "powershell.exe" "-NoProfile" "-ExecutionPolicy" "Bypass" "-File" "C:\win_read_log.ps1" "-Tail" "80" "-LogPath" "C:\Users\<USER>\AppData\Roaming\FinanceCopilot\FinanceCopilot\app.log"
/Applications/UTM.app/Contents/MacOS/utmctl file pull "<VM>" "C:\fc_applog.txt"
```
The script writes the last `-Tail` lines to `C:\fc_applog.txt` and appends `READLOG_DONE` as the completion marker. The same `previous_session.log` and `finance_copilot_*.db` live in that folder.

# Git Workflow

- Do NOT commit automatically after every change. Build first, let the user test, and only commit when the user asks or when starting a completely different task.
- Use concise, meaningful commit messages.
- NEVER add `Co-Authored-By:` lines to commits. Not under any circumstances, not for any reason. No exceptions.
- **Use `develop` branch for testing/exchanging code** (e.g. syncing with Windows VM). Never push to `main` unless the user explicitly confirms. Push to `develop` freely for testing.
- Only bump `appVersion` in `lib/version.dart` when releasing on `main`, not on develop/feature branches.
- **NEVER commit or push until ALL test suites have passed. No exceptions.**
- **NEVER run git add/commit/push while tests are still running.** Wait for all test results first.
- Before every commit, run ALL of these and verify green:
  1. `dart fix --apply && dart analyze lib/ test/ integration_test/` -- zero warnings/infos allowed
  2. `flutter test` -- all unit tests must pass
  3. `flutter test integration_test/all_tests.dart -d macos --dart-define=DB_FILE_NAME=finance_copilot_test.db` -- all integration tests must pass. ALWAYS pass `_test.db`; integration tests delete that DB file, and using `finance_copilot_dev.db` will wipe local dev data.
  4. `flutter test integration_test/live_data_fetch_test.dart -d macos --dart-define=DB_FILE_NAME=finance_copilot_test.db` -- live data fetch test must pass
  5. NEVER commit with known failing tests. NEVER skip any test suite.

## Releasing a new version

Version is derived from the git tag. Never hand-edit `lib/version.dart`.

**Single source of truth = the git tag. Never bump versions by hand** (not `lib/version.dart`, not `pubspec.yaml`, not `android/local.properties`). On a `vX.Y.Z` tag, CI injects the version everywhere:
- `lib/version.dart` `appVersion` is rewritten in-place (in-app display version).
- Native build version (Android `versionName`/`versionCode`, macOS/Windows) is set via `flutter build --build-name=X.Y.Z --build-number=<run_number>`.

`pubspec.yaml` stays at the placeholder `0.0.0+1` and `android/local.properties` carries no `flutter.versionName`/`flutter.versionCode` lines, so local/dev builds intentionally report `0.0.0` (obviously not a release). If a stale `flutter.versionName=...` reappears in `local.properties` (Flutter sometimes caches it), delete those two lines — do not edit them.

- Always use `./tool/do-release.sh` for releases (it `cd`s to the repo root itself, so it can be run from anywhere). It is the release entrypoint; do not hand-run the individual tag/release steps unless the script itself cannot complete. If a pre-release cleanup hook is available, pass it via `--cleanup-cmd` or `PRE_RELEASE_CLEANUP_CMD`.
- The script accepts `--version`, `--title`, and optional `--merge-pr`, `--notes-file`, `--cleanup-cmd`, `--skip-cleanup`, and `--no-sync-develop`.

0. **Pre-release check**: a working nightly build with `main` merged into `develop` must exist and pass CI before starting the release. Verify with `gh run list --branch develop --limit 1`.
1. Merge `develop` into `main` (via PR if protected, else direct merge).
2. Summarize changes: run `git log --oneline vPREVIOUS..HEAD` and write a user-facing summary.
3. Tag and push: `git tag vX.Y.Z && git push origin vX.Y.Z`
4. Create GitHub Release: `gh release create vX.Y.Z --title "vX.Y.Z -- short description" --notes "..."`
5. Wait for CI to complete: `gh run list --branch vX.Y.Z --limit 1` -- CI builds artifacts, attaches to release, updates Homebrew tap.
6. Sync develop from main if anything changed on main.


# Code Quality

- Dart formatting is mandatory. Any Dart file you change is not done until you run `dart format` on the touched files or on `lib test integration_test` when the scope is broad.
- Formatting regressions must be blocked, not hand-fixed later. The formatter SDK is pinned in `.flutter-version`; use `tool/check_dart_format.sh` as the final formatting check so local runs fail fast if the Flutter/Dart formatter version drifts from CI.
- Never duplicate code. Extract shared logic into utilities or service methods.
- Single source of truth: queries, parsing, business logic must be defined once and reused.
- **Before writing a new widget/util/service method, grep the codebase for existing equivalents.** If one exists, REUSE it. Copy/paste is a regression. When two implementations of the same UI element exist, the older/canonical one wins; the newer collapses into it via shared code.
- **Fit into the current app.** Never start from scratch when an existing implementation can be extended. Read what's there before adding a parallel implementation.
- **Financial accuracy**: NEVER silently fallback to wrong values when data is missing. No `?? 1.0` for FX rates, no returning original amounts when conversion fails. Missing data must be surfaced (log warning, show indicator, skip the calculation) — never hidden behind a default that produces silently incorrect financial figures.
- **Per-asset price fallbacks are FORBIDDEN.** If a price is missing, the asset shows "—" and is excluded from totals with a footnote count. Never invent a value.
- **Tests are mandatory**: Every new feature, bug fix, or service method MUST include tests. Coverage must increase, never decrease. If an existing test needs to change, the change must be proven necessary (the old behavior was wrong), not blindly modified to make it pass.
- **NEVER modify or delete existing tests without explicit user consent.** If a test fails after your changes, the code is wrong — not the test. Fix the code to make the existing test pass. Only ask the user to change a test if you can prove the test itself encodes incorrect behavior.
- **Before any refactor or optimization**: Write a specific test that pins the current behavior of the code you're about to change. Run it and confirm it passes. Only then refactor. After refactoring, the same test must still pass with identical results. This is non-negotiable — no behavioral change without a test proving equivalence.

# UI Consistency

- **Delete affordance** is one canonical pattern across the app: trashcan icon in detail view + swipe-to-delete in lists. Long-press-to-delete is forbidden going forward. Three-dot menus offering delete must be reconciled to the canonical pattern.
- **Collapsible cards**: chevron + header layout MUST match the Cash Flow tab implementation (`lib/ui/screens/dashboard/cashflow_tab.dart`). Header must NOT change on expand/collapse; expand must scroll smoothly, not snap. Reuse the existing widget — do not re-implement.
- **Bottom-of-screen "Next" buttons in wizards** MUST share a common navbar widget. Fix consistently across all wizards, never one-by-one.
- **Empty states** and **error toasts/snackbars** use one shared component each, with consistent placement.
- Before adding a new widget, grep for existing equivalents. Reuse > re-implement.
- **Every primary screen** plugs into the global app shell via two paired conventions, both required so new screens automatically inherit shell features:
  1. AppBar: `AppBar(actions: globalAppBarActions(context, ref, local: [...]))` — refresh, settings, import/export, privacy, network retry.
  2. Body: wrap the main scrollable in `MobilePullToRefresh(child: ListView/SingleChildScrollView(physics: AlwaysScrollableScrollPhysics(), ...))` so the same global refresh fires on a pull-down (Android/iOS only; no-op on desktop).

# Localization

- Every user-visible string MUST come from `AppStrings`/l10n. Literal `Text('...')` / `Text("...")` in `lib/ui/` is a violation — fix it immediately.
- Number parsing MUST use the active locale's decimal/group separator (`NumberFormat(localeTag).parse()`). NEVER hardcode `.` or `,` parsing logic. The Italian locale uses `,` as decimal separator — do not assume `.`.
- Date parsing AND formatting MUST be locale-aware. Route every date through `lib/utils/date_parser.dart` (single entry point). `DateFormat` instances MUST be constructed with an explicit locale tag.
- All locale bundles (en, it, …) must cover every key — no missing translations.
- When responding to GitHub issues opened by Italian-speaking users, reply in Italian.

# Branch & DB Discipline

- **Before any code edit**: confirm the current branch matches the user's stated target. If unclear, ASK. Do not assume `develop`.
- **Before launching the app or running integration tests**: confirm `DB_FILE_NAME` matches the intended dev DB. Mixing the dev container DB with the user's real production DB (the sandboxed app DB — see "Database & Sandbox" below for the current per-platform path) is a top historical failure — never write to the real DB from tests/builds.
- Never commit dart-defines or env-specific config to a non-feature branch.
- When the user references a specific DB path or branch name, that overrides any default — re-confirm before acting.



# Navigation

- Prefer checking logs, existing codebase knowledge, and context first. Only use `find` or other CLI exploratory commands when the built-in tools (Glob, Grep, Read) cannot locate what you need.

# Long-Running Commands

- Never sleep longer than 10 seconds in any command. Run long tasks in background and check for progress periodically.

# Python

- NEVER use `--break-system-packages` with pip. Use `python3 -m venv` for virtual environments instead.

# Database & Sandbox

The app runs sandboxed on macOS. All internal data lives inside the container.

- **macOS DB**: `~/Library/Containers/net.bazzani.financecopilot/Data/Library/Application Support/net.bazzani.financecopilot/finance_copilot.db`
- **macOS logs**: `tail -f ~/Library/Containers/net.bazzani.financecopilot/Data/Library/Application\ Support/net.bazzani.financecopilot/app.log`
- **macOS OS log**: `log stream --predicate 'subsystem == "net.bazzani.financecopilot"' --level debug`
- **Windows DB**: `%APPDATA%\net.bazzani.financecopilot\finance_copilot.db` (i.e. `C:\Users\<USER>\AppData\Roaming\net.bazzani.financecopilot\finance_copilot.db`)
- **Windows logs**: `Get-Content $env:APPDATA\net.bazzani.financecopilot\app.log -Wait`
- **Android logs**: `adb logcat -s flutter`
- **Previous session log**: `previous_session.log` (same dir as app.log, for bug reports)
- **Log level**: defaults to INFO. Build/run with `--dart-define=LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` (aliases: `FINE`/`TRACE`/`FINEST`/`ALL`) to capture `fine()` diagnostics — e.g. the import wizard's `_buildColumnMappings` dump that shows the resolved mappings/autoCalc/revalue-amount-column when an import produces unexpected values. Never add/remove temporary log lines for one-off debugging; log at `fine()` and raise the level instead.
- Never use `assets.db` in the repo root (stale copy, gitignored).

# Architecture

- The app must be **pure Flutter/Dart**. No Python scripts or external tools for runtime functionality.
- All data fetching (prices, ETF composition, etc.) must happen inside the Dart app itself.
- The released artifact must be fully self-contained.
- For reverse engineering websites/APIs: use any tool (curl, Playwright, Python, etc.) for exploration, but the final implementation must be in Dart/Flutter.
- **Never mention external data sources** (websites, APIs, providers) by name in README, comments, commit messages, CI config, screenshots, alt text, identifiers (class/file/variable names), log messages, doc strings, or user-facing strings. Refer to them generically (e.g. "market data provider", "composition data").
  - **Functional URL literals are exempt** (host strings in `lib/services/market/web_market_data_service.dart`, `lib/services/market/web_page_parser.dart`, `lib/services/market/composition_service.dart`, and `'Origin'`/`'Referer'` headers): these are operational data — the literal IS the integration point — and replacing them would change which provider we integrate with. Grep hits inside `https://...` URL strings, `host.endsWith(...)` validators, `Origin`/`Referer` headers, and test fixture HTML/URL files are acceptable. New occurrences in those forms are also fine.
  - **Test fixtures are exempt**: `test/fixtures/instrument_page_*.html` and URL strings inside test files are functional test data.
  - **Historical migration code is exempt**: SQL strings in `database.dart`'s `onUpgrade` migrations from earlier versions (e.g. v8/v9/v11) reference legacy provider names because they ran on past upgrades; rewriting them would not change persisted DB data and risks divergence from what shipped.
  - Outside those exemptions, the grep `Investing\.com\|InvestingCom\|InvestingPage\|InvestingComService\|investing_com\|investing_page` must return zero hits.
- **Date convention**: `operationDate` = when the bank processed it (used for import wipe-and-replace dedup). `valueDate` = when the money actually moved (used for display, ordering, charts, balance computation). All UI and queries must use `valueDate` for display/ordering. `operationDate` is only for the import dedup cutoff. Asset events and Income MUST have a populated `valueDate`.

# Pre-Release Checklist

- Before tagging a release on `main`, run `/pre-release-cleanup` on `develop`. Merge to `main` only after it reports zero findings across all phases (UI consistency, dedup, silent defaults, locale, date semantics, LoC, dead code, provider-name leaks, bug hunt, overreach).

<!-- code-review-graph MCP tools -->
## MCP Tools: code-review-graph

**IMPORTANT: This project has a knowledge graph. ALWAYS use the
code-review-graph MCP tools BEFORE using Grep/Glob/Read to explore
the codebase.** The graph is faster, cheaper (fewer tokens), and gives
you structural context (callers, dependents, test coverage) that file
scanning cannot.

### When to use graph tools FIRST

- **Exploring code**: `semantic_search_nodes` or `query_graph` instead of Grep
- **Understanding impact**: `get_impact_radius` instead of manually tracing imports
- **Code review**: `detect_changes` + `get_review_context` instead of reading entire files
- **Finding relationships**: `query_graph` with callers_of/callees_of/imports_of/tests_for
- **Architecture questions**: `get_architecture_overview` + `list_communities`

Fall back to Grep/Glob/Read **only** when the graph doesn't cover what you need.

### Key Tools

| Tool | Use when |
| ------ | ---------- |
| `detect_changes` | Reviewing code changes — gives risk-scored analysis |
| `get_review_context` | Need source snippets for review — token-efficient |
| `get_impact_radius` | Understanding blast radius of a change |
| `get_affected_flows` | Finding which execution paths are impacted |
| `query_graph` | Tracing callers, callees, imports, tests, dependencies |
| `semantic_search_nodes` | Finding functions/classes by name or keyword |
| `get_architecture_overview` | Understanding high-level codebase structure |
| `refactor_tool` | Planning renames, finding dead code |

### Workflow

1. The graph auto-updates on file changes (via hooks).
2. Use `detect_changes` for code review.
3. Use `get_affected_flows` to understand impact.
4. Use `query_graph` pattern="tests_for" to check coverage.
