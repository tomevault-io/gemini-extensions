## Overview

This is an MCP server (81 tools) that connects AI coding agents to Autodesk Fusion 360 for CAD automation. It consists of two pieces:

1. **MCP Server** (this repo) — speaks MCP protocol over stdio, forwards commands to Fusion via TCP
2. **Fusion 360 Add-in** — runs inside Fusion, executes commands on the main thread via CustomEvent bridge

## How the system works

```
Claude Code ──stdio──> MCP Server ──TCP :9876──> Fusion Add-in ──CustomEvent──> Main Thread
                                   <──JSON──                    <──result──
```

The add-in uses a CustomEvent + work queue pattern to safely dispatch all Fusion API calls to the main thread. Socket threads submit work items and block on a per-item `threading.Event` until the main thread completes execution.

## Response shape

Every tool call returns a dict-shaped result with these conventions — read them instead of guessing whether an operation worked:

**Success:**
```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "body_name": "Body1",   // tool-specific fields
  ...,
  "deltas": {             // present only for mutations
    "body_count_before": 0,
    "body_count_after":  1,
    "body_count_delta":  1,
    "mass_g_before": 0.0,
    "mass_g_after":  7.85,
    "mass_g_delta":  7.85,
    "bbox_before": null,
    "bbox_after":  {"min": [0,0,0], "max": [1,1,1]}
  }
}
```

**Failure (no exception — the error flows back as data):**
```json
{
  "ok": false,
  "error_kind":    "PROFILE_NOT_CLOSED",     // stable tag you can branch on
  "error_message": "No profiles in sketch",  // short human-readable
  "hints":  ["close the loop", "..."],        // contextual repair suggestions
  "traceback": "..."                         // full traceback for debugging
}
```

Known `error_kind` values: `PROFILE_NOT_CLOSED`, `SKETCH_NOT_FOUND`, `BODY_NOT_FOUND`, `SELF_INTERSECTION`, `REGEN_FAILED`, `BOOLEAN_NO_OP`, `INVALID_INPUT`, `NO_ACTIVE_DESIGN`, `DESIGN_TYPE_MISMATCH`, `TIMEOUT`, `UNKNOWN_COMMAND`, `UNKNOWN`.

**Use the deltas to sanity-check without a render.** A `boolean_operation` that reports `body_count_delta: 0, mass_g_delta: 0` did nothing — follow up with `check_interference` before retrying. An `extrude` that shifts mass by three orders of magnitude is probably using the wrong units.

**Use `render_view` sparingly** — it returns ~200KB–2MB of base64 image data. Render after a logical checkpoint (finished a feature, about to commit), not after every mutation. Deltas already tell you whether the feature *did* something; `render_view` tells you whether it did the *right* something.

## MCP protocol features

- **Tool annotations** — every tool is tagged `readOnlyHint`, `destructiveHint`, `idempotentHint` so clients can auto-approve safe operations
- **Resources** — `fusion360://status`, `fusion360://design`, `fusion360://parameters`
- **Resource templates** — `fusion360://body/{name}`, `fusion360://component/{name}`
- **Prompts** — `create-box`, `model-threaded-bolt`, `sheet-metal-enclosure` workflow templates
- **Structured errors** — `isError=True` when the add-in reports failures. Error results carry `error_kind`, `hints`, and a traceback so the agent can branch on failure mode rather than parsing prose (see _Response shape_ above).
- **Mock mode** — `--mode mock` returns test data without Fusion running

## Important constraints

- **One operation per tool call.** Never batch multiple operations — Fusion's API is not thread-safe and complex scripts crash the add-in.
- **No loops inside execute_code.** If you need to create 3 similar features, make 3 separate tool calls.
- **Keep execute_code under ~15 lines.** Prefer the dedicated tools over execute_code whenever possible.
- **Units are centimeters.** Fusion's internal API uses cm, not mm.
- **30-second timeout.** Commands that take longer than 30s will return a timeout error.
- **body_name preferred over body_index.** Use named lookups when possible.
- **Verify after each step.** Call `get_scene_info` or `get_object_info` to confirm success — don't assume from lack of error.
- **Name everything.** Name every body and sketch explicitly so they can be referenced reliably in later steps.

## Troubleshooting

- If commands fail with "Not connected", the Fusion add-in isn't running. The user needs to start it in Fusion (Shift+S > Add-Ins > Run).
- If commands time out, the Fusion main thread may be blocked (modal dialog, heavy computation).
- After any error, call `get_scene_info` to check if the operation partially applied before retrying.
- Logs are written to `~/fusion360mcp.log` by the add-in.
