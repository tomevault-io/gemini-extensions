# Siedler Clone — CLAUDE.md

A faithful recreation of Die Siedler 7's gameplay systems in Unity 6. Local only, no server, no monetization. Personal project built with Claude Code + Unity MCP.

> **The goal & Definition of Done live in [VISION.md](VISION.md)** — read it when a decision
> needs a tie-breaker. This file is the technical source of truth: architecture, code style,
> and the verified game-design spec. Current status lives in [project_status.md](project_status.md).

## Tech Stack

- **Engine:** Unity 6 (URP), C# 9+
- **Target:** 60 FPS, single-player + AI opponents, PC/Mac standalone
- **No DOTS/ECS** — 200-500 entities don't benefit; use MonoBehaviour + SO + pure C#

## Three-Layer Architecture

| Layer | Location | Rule |
|-------|----------|------|
| **Data** | `Assets/Data/` | ScriptableObjects — editable in Inspector, no hardcoded values |
| **Simulation** | `Assets/Scripts/Simulation/` | Pure C# — NO UnityEngine (except Vector3/Mathf). NUnit testable. |
| **Presentation** | `Assets/Scripts/Presentation/` + `UI/` | MonoBehaviour — reads state via `GameController.Instance`, never modifies simulation directly |

## Code Style

- **Namespaces:** `Settlers.Simulation`, `Settlers.Presentation`, `Settlers.UI`, `Settlers.Data`
- Classes: `PascalCase` | Variables: `camelCase` | Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` | Private fields: `_camelCase`
- One class per file, filename matches class. No file over 300 lines.
- XML docs on all public APIs. Use `[SerializeField] private` for Inspector fields.
- All magic numbers in GameConstants SO. All definitions in individual SO assets.

## Skill Reference

| Topic | Skill to read |
|-------|---------------|
| Game mechanics (buildings, production, food, military, trade, VPs) | `settlers-game-design` |
| Architecture patterns, SO patterns, testing, system update order | `settlers-unity-architecture` |
| Camera, terrain, building visuals, lighting, UI layout | `settlers-unity-visuals` |
| Map design, sector layouts, batch asset creation | `settlers-map-content` |
| Screenshot workflow, UI reference, visual fidelity | `settlers-7-fidelity` |
| Cost saving, session protocol, token budgets | `cost-saving` |

## Session Protocol

1. Read **CLAUDE.md** (this file) + **[VISION.md](VISION.md)** (the goal) + **[project_status.md](project_status.md)** (where we are) at session start
2. Read relevant skill(s) matching the session's layer
3. **Screenshot workflow:** user provides screenshots → analyse HUD, buildings, UI → derive concrete tasks
4. Update `project_status.md` at session end; log the session to the Wissensdatenbank

## Workflow

1. Claude Code writes C# in `Assets/Scripts/`, Unity auto-recompiles
2. Visual verification via user screenshots from Unity Editor Play Mode
3. NUnit tests in `Assets/Tests/Editor/` — run without Play Mode
4. SO .asset files created via Editor menu scripts (`Settlers > Generate All`)
5. Prefabs, materials, lighting, 3D models → user configures in Unity Editor

## Assembly Definitions

- `Settlers.Simulation` — Pure C#, `noEngineReferences: true`. Any `using UnityEngine` = compile error.
- `Settlers.Game` — Presentation + UI + Data layers. References Simulation + TMPro + InputSystem + URP.
- `Settlers.Editor` — Editor-only scripts. References Simulation + Game.
- `Settlers.Tests` — Editor test assembly. References Simulation + NUnit.

## Game Design: §1 Map & Sectors

Maps are predefined, divided into sectors connected via a graph (18-43+ sectors). Maps support 1-4 players.

**Sector properties:** Owner (player/neutral/unowned), garrison strength, resource deposits (coal/iron/gold/stone), fertile land, forest, fishing, water, special buildings, event locations, build slots.

**Conquest — Three Methods:**
1. **Military** (neutral + enemy): General + army → auto-resolve combat. Fortified sectors need musketeers/cannons.
2. **Proselytism** (neutral only): ~6 clerics (unfortified) or ~12 (fortified). Clerics traverse neutral/enemy sectors.
3. **Bribery** (neutral only): Coins + Garments + Jewelry. Fastest but most expensive.

**Rewards:** +1 prestige + choice of reward package (see §14.3) + sector resource access.

---

## Critical Rules (Prevent Bugs)

1. **Sector graph, not hex grid** — discrete sectors with terrain inside each
2. **Food boost halts on empty** — toggled on + no food = production STOPS (no fallback)
3. **Noble Residence needs food to function** — no food = all work yards idle
4. **All goods flow through storehouses** — workers never carry between buildings directly
5. **Technologies are first-come-first-served** — once researched, permanently locked for all others
6. **Trade outposts are first-come-first-served** — once claimed, exclusive to that player
7. **VPs can be dynamic (stealable) or permanent** — implement both types
8. **Each work yard needs 1 settler + 1 tool** — no tool = work yard idle
9. **Locked buildings show as gray silhouettes** — never hidden from the build menu
10. **Reward modal is player-choice** — never auto-grant; always show BELOHNUNGEN modal after neutral conquest

> **Engine gotcha:** every `StartGame` builds a fresh `EventBus` (new `GameState`). Anything
> that subscribed to the old bus (bootstrap wiring, audio, VFX) must re-subscribe after a
> restart or its handlers go silent. See `project_status.md` for the fresh-EventBus pattern.

---

## Victory Overview

- **Military:** Stronghold → 5 unit types → Generals (35 soldiers, 5 max) → auto-combat
- **Technology:** Church → 3 cleric types → Monasteries (shared, blockable) → 18 techs in 3 tiers
- **Trade:** Export Office → 3 trader types → Trade Map (network graph, first-come outposts)
- **Win:** reach required VP count → 3-min countdown → win if still held

## Game Design: §14 UI Reference (verified from original screenshots)

> All German strings are verified 1:1 from original Die Siedler 7 screenshots (2026-06-10).
> Use these EXACT strings in the UI. Do not paraphrase or translate.

### §14.1 Verified UI Strings (exact German text)

| Context | Exact string |
|---------|-------------|
| Carrier idle — no goods | `Einige Güter fehlen. Ich muss warten.` |
| Carrier impatient | `Wer trödelt denn da? Ihr verschwendet meine Zeit!` |
| Prestige panel title | `PRESTIGE-OPTIONEN` (+ available points as green number) |
| Reward panel title | `BELOHNUNGEN` |
| Build menu title | `BAUEN` |
| VP overview title | `ÜBERSICHT` |
| Production overview label | `Produktionsübersicht: <Ware>` |
| Stats panel columns | `ERFORDERT` / `PRODUZIERT VON` / `ERBRINGT` / `VERBRAUCHT VON` |

### §14.2 Victory Points — complete German names (14 VPs)

The VP ring shows all VPs. Player-held = green highlight; others = silver/gray.

| German VP name | Path / Category |
|----------------|-----------------|
| `Wunderkind` | Technology — first to research the Special Technology |
| `Quelle der Weisheit` | Technology — research milestone |
| `Bischofssitz` | Technology — church/clergy |
| `Generalissimus` | Military — army/generals |
| `Sonnenkönig` | Military / Prestige |
| `Nebelsumpf` | Special sector (map event location) |
| `Handelsaußenposten` | Trade — trade outpost (appears per-player) |
| `Handelsgesellschaft` | Trade — trading company |
| `Sparfuchs` | Economy — coins/savings (Banker equivalent) |
| `Imperator` | Economy — sector count (Emperor) |
| `Metropole` | Economy — population (Metropolis) |
| `Spezieller Sektor` | Special sector control (appears per-player) |

> `Handelsaußenposten` and `Spezieller Sektor` can appear **twice** in the ring —
> once per relevant player/instance. The VP system must support the same VP category
> being held by different players simultaneously.

**Wunderkind VP — exact description text:**
```
Seid der Erste, der über die Spezielle Technologie verfügt, um diesen Siegpunkt zu erhalten.
Dazu müsst Ihr in Eurer Kirche Geistliche anwerben und sie Technologien erforschen lassen.
```

**VP overview sidebar filter labels (exact):**
`Kriegsführung` · `Arbeitsgebäude` · `Verpflegung` · `Geologe` · `Konstruktion`

### §14.3 Conquest Reward Modal (`BELOHNUNGEN`)

After conquering a **neutral** sector, a modal appears. Player picks **exactly one** package.

```
BELOHNUNGEN
├── Bevölkerungsbelohnung      (population reward — 1 option)
├── Eroberungsbelohnung        (conquest reward variant A)
├── Eroberungsbelohnung        (conquest reward variant B)
└── Eroberungsbelohnung        (conquest reward variant C)
```

Implementation: 1 population-type + 3 conquest-type packages, all clickable, single-select.
**Never auto-grant.** This is Critical Rule #10.

### §14.4 Build Menu — three-tab structure (`BAUEN`)

Small grid modal (3x3 icons per tab), three tabs:

| Tab | Icon | Category | Contents |
|-----|------|----------|----------|
| 1 | House | Base / economy buildings | Residence, Noble Residence, Lodge, Farm, Mountain Shelter + variants |
| 2 | Shield | Prestige-gated specials | Locked = gray silhouette (not hidden) |
| 3 | Crown | Military / prestige objects | Stronghold, Church, Export Office; locked = gray silhouette |

Locked buildings always render as **gray silhouettes** — the player sees what unlocks at higher prestige.

### §14.5 Prestige Panel (`PRESTIGE-OPTIONEN`)

Opens via crown icon in bottom bar. Title: `PRESTIGE-OPTIONEN` + green number (available points).

Layout — each row has:
- **Left column:** main option with gold frame (activatable when points available)
- **Right column:** upgrade chain of 2-3 stages connected by a line; locked stages grayed out

Left-column option types (by icon):
- Hammer → construction upgrades
- Figures → population / residence upgrades
- Up-arrow → sector / tier upgrades

### §14.6 Technology Tree (Monastery research)

Dark stone background, candle holders on the sides. Each technology = a card.
Research cost format: **Geistliche / Mönche / Prälaten** (clerics / monks / prelates).

| Technology | Cost G/M/P |
|------------|------------|
| Holzfäller (woodcutter) | 3/0/0 |
| Stiefel (boots) | 3/0/0 |
| Rüstung (armor) | 3/0/0 |
| Fernrohr (telescope) | 4/1/0 |
| Kanone (cannon) | 4/1/0 |
| Fischerei (fishing) | 4/2/0 |
| Alchemist | 4/2/0 |
| Medkit | 4/2/0 |
| Statue | 5/2/1 |
| Stein (stone) | 5/2/1 |
| Schriftrolle (scroll) | 5/2/1 |
| Ritter (knight) | 5/2/1 |
| Star tech (center node) | 9/7/5 (apex) |

Gold-framed cards = VP techs (Wunderkind mechanic: first to research wins the VP).

### §14.7 Trade Map (`Handelskarte`)

Full-screen parchment world map (compass rose, lat/long grid, dashed connection lines).

| Node state | Visual | Meaning |
|------------|--------|---------|
| Player capital | Castle icon, gold frame | Home base (center) |
| Player outpost | Card, gold frame | Claimed by this player |
| Empty outpost | Card, gray frame | Claimable — no trader assigned |
| Enemy outpost | Card, red frame | Exclusive to opponent |
| Treasure node | Chest icon, 2-3 coins | Loot node |

Node card format: `[input good] → [output good]  [trader count]`
Example values from screenshot: `4 → 6 [2]`, `3 → 6 [2]`, `2 → 4 [2]`

### §14.8 HUD Layout Reference

**Top bar (center):** `[population current/max]  [coins]  [weapons]  [tools]  [food]`
Example: `34/46  0  16  12  24`

**Bottom action bar (left to right):**
`map` · `crown (prestige)` · `treasure` · `stats book` · `star level` · `military overview` · `trade map` · `combat` · `church/tech`

Prestige level shown as star + number on the bottom bar (e.g. star 6).
Player VP badges: floating portrait + colored circle + VP count. Red = enemy, green = own/allied.

### §14.9 Resource Inventory — verified goods list

| Category | Goods |
|----------|-------|
| Wood chain | Holz, Planken, Kohle |
| Stone chain | Stein |
| Food chain | Getreide, Mehl, Brot, Bier, Fisch, Fleisch, Würste, Wasser |
| Luxury | Gewürz, Wein, Schmuck, Kleidung, Pelz, Leder |
| Military | Waffen, Kanonen, Kanonenkugeln, Schwerter |
| Economy | Münzen, Werkzeug |

### §14.10 Visual Style Reference (for asset replacement pass)

- **Sector borders:** Physical stone-wall 3D objects — not abstract lines. Wall runs the full perimeter of every owned sector.
- **Roads:** Unpaved dirt by default. Paved stone roads unlocked via prestige upgrade only.
- **Terrain:** Green grass (fertile) clearly distinct from red/sandy soil (infertile). Single trees inside sectors, rocks as natural borders and decoration.
- **Home castle:** Multi-story, red flags, gold accents — dominates the home sector visually.
- **Enemy stronghold:** Large fortified structure, red flags, stone walls, soldiers visible on paths, cannon emplacements.
- **Lighting / art direction:** Shadows toward cool saturated tones, lit areas in warm colors. Target: "dreamy fairy tale look" (original art director mandate). Implement via URP lighting + color grading post-processing.

## Project State (summary)

Foundation complete: 20 simulation subsystems, ~190 script files, **487/487 NUnit tests green**,
bilingual EN/DE (test-enforced key parity), playable end-to-end and play-mode validated.
Visual roadmap Phases 1–2 done (terrain & lighting; playability quick wins). **Next: Phase 3,
building visual overhaul.** Full, current detail — file counts, systems, per-session changes,
open tasks — lives in **[project_status.md](project_status.md)**. The finish line is defined in
**[VISION.md](VISION.md)**.

---

**The economy is the game. Everything — military, technology, trade, victory — is powered by production chains flowing through storehouses. Get the storehouse relay and food boosting right, and everything else falls into place.**
