# Agent Instructions

Issues live in the MAC hub task ledger (`mac task`), which is the
canonical execution store. `.tickets/` is ignored local operational
state for migration/compatibility workflows only; do not rely on it as
a checked-in source of truth and do not create or commit `.tickets/`
files during normal work.

This project does **not** use beads (`bd`) or dolt — issue tracking is the
**mac task ledger** (`mac task`), a beads-equivalent durable ledger that avoids
the beads/dolt sync problems. It is correct to say we do not use beads; it is
**not** correct to say we lack a durable task ledger — we use mac tasks. The
legacy beads read/write bridge is not the normal execution path, dolt sync is
disabled, and `.beads/` has been removed. Remaining beads commands are for
read-only detection and one-way migration. Do not run `bd`; use `mac task`.

## Fleet Host Resolution

`~/.mac/fleets.yaml` is the definitive source of truth for fleet agent targets.
When checking, refreshing, deploying to, or SSHing into a fleet agent, resolve
the agent's current `target` from that file first. Do not assume a hostname from
the agent name, local SSH aliases, known_hosts entries, old fleet backups, hub
history, or prior conversation context; those can be stale after host swaps.

## Quick Reference

```bash
# Read issues
mac task ready --limit 10                    # open + deps done + unclaimed + dispatchable
mac task stats                               # counts by state
mac task search <keyword>                    # title/description match

# Projects
mac project create <project> --active        # manual project, immediately dispatchable
mac project onboard <repo-url> --project=<project>  # creates contract-authoring task
mac bridge repository register <name> <path> --project=<project>
mac bridge repository repos
mac project activate <project>               # clear project-level dispatch pause

# Lifecycle
mac task create "title" --project=<project> --description-file=desc.txt --metadata-file=meta.json
mac task create "title" --no-dispatch        # stage task; writes metadata.no_dispatch=true
mac task release <task_id>                   # clear no_dispatch so fleet can claim it
mac task break-glass <task_id> <agent_id> --reason="..."  # admin, single-use direct-host recovery
mac task break-glass-list <task_id>          # inspect durable recovery authorization
mac task break-glass-revoke <auth_id> --reason="..."
mac task claim <task_id> <agent_id>
mac task start <task_id> <agent_id>
mac task show <task_id>                      # detail + history
mac task close <task_id> --reason="..."
mac dispatch tick --limit 10                 # ask dispatcher to assign ready work now

# Memories (cross-session knowledge)
mac memory remember <key> "<content>" --project=mac
mac memory list --project=mac
mac memory forget <key> --project=mac

# Inspect or migrate other repos that still have legacy beads state
mac task detect-beads <repo>
mac task migrate-beads <repo> --project=<name> --tickets-only
```

## Fleet Operational Learning

Treat operational outcomes as shared control inputs, not disposable log lines.
Repository-access attempts record secret-free `mac.fleet_learning.v1` memories;
reviewer routing prefers recent success and temporarily avoids a newer
authentication failure. Do not repeatedly retry the same credential pattern on
the same agent. Allow the workflow to choose a peer with a proven success, or
repair the credential and supersede the failure with a successful attempt.

Never store credential values, authenticated URLs, or raw secret-bearing
command output in memory. Store only the credential source name, redacted host,
operation, outcome, classified failure, and actionable remediation. See
`docs/fleet-operational-learning.md` for the schema and lifecycle contract.

> Pass multi-line / shell-hostile content (parens, backticks, `$VAR`, newlines) via the `--<name>-file` variants instead of inline quotes. `--<name>-file -` reads from stdin.

`no_dispatch` is a hold flag, not a lifecycle state. The held form is
`metadata.no_dispatch=true`; `mac task release` removes that key instead of
writing `false`. A task with no `no_dispatch` key is dispatchable, subject to
dependencies, worker capabilities, leases, and project dispatch pause.

To tell agents to work on a project, create or onboard the project, create
project-scoped tasks, make sure the project is active, release any staged
tasks, and let loop-mode agents claim from `mac task ready`. Use
`mac dispatch tick` for an immediate dispatcher pass, or `mac task claim` /
`mac task start` when assigning a specific agent manually.

## CodeGraph Runtime Baseline

CodeGraph is a legitimate runtime assumption in the default agent environment.
Fleet deploy installs `codegraph`, runs `codegraph install`, and fails the
deploy if CodeGraph cannot be prepared; the OpenShell agent image does the same
at image build time. Agents may use CodeGraph to understand repository APIs,
code behavior, call relationships, and skills that benefit from code structure.
Use it as analysis support, not as a replacement for reading source files and
running tests.

When analyzing a repository, run `codegraph init` if the index is absent or
stale. `.codegraph/` is generated local state: do not commit it, include it in
deliverables, or treat it as the task ledger.

For source, build, dependency, or runtime config changes, CodeGraph is an
enforced evidence gate. Before a worker-owned push or approved review, the
worker must record a passing `mac.codegraph_audit.v1` result from `codegraph
init`/`codegraph sync` plus `codegraph affected` for the changed files. Pure
documentation/media/text-only changes may record `codegraph.status=skipped`
with `reason=non_code_change`.

## Mandatory Pre-Push Test Gate (all code executor tasks)

Every code-executor worker (`mac-worker-python-coder-opencode` and any
other code executor) enforces a **mandatory pre-push verification gate**
before it pushes a branch or opens a Merge Request. The gate is
implemented at the worker execution layer in
`deploy/codex-runner/mac-task-executor-opencode-build` so it **cannot be
bypassed** by task-level instructions or per-project config, and it
applies uniformly to **every** repo (`mac`, `ivan-plugin`,
`hermes-agent-custom`, and any future repo).

Sequence before any `git push` / MR:

1. **Detect test command** — an executable repository-owned
   `scripts/run-sanity-tests.sh` plus `test-policy.toml` is preferred and gets
   the prepared base SHA; otherwise `package.json` (`test` script) → `npm test`;
   `pyproject.toml`/`pytest.ini`/`setup.cfg`/`setup.py` → `pytest`;
   `Makefile` (`test` target) → `make test`; otherwise scan
   `README.md`/`CONTRIBUTING.md`. If none can be detected the gate does
   **not** skip — the task is routed to `needs_review` ("could not detect
   test command — manual verification required").
2. **Lint/format** (auto-fix attempted; non-blocking) — `npm run lint`
   (`-- --fix`), `eslint .` (`--fix`), `prettier --check .` (`--write`),
   `ruff check .` (`--fix`), or `flake8 .`. Lint failures are recorded in
   evidence but do not block; tests are the hard gate.
3. **Run tests** — execute the detected command in the repo root,
   capturing full stdout+stderr.
4. **Run CodeGraph audit when relevant** — for source, build, dependency,
   or runtime config changes, run `codegraph init` or `codegraph sync`, then
   `codegraph affected` for the changed files. Audit failure blocks the push.
5. **Gate decision** — tests plus required CodeGraph audit pass → push +
   open MR; failure → STOP (no push, no MR), transition to `needs_review`
   with full evidence.

Every coding task's `mac.worker_evidence.v1` manifest therefore always
carries numbered evidence items: `1 | Lint/Format`, `2 | Tests`, and on
success `3 | Push` + `4 | MR`; on test failure item 3 becomes
`Test Failures` (full output, failing test names, suggested fix), and on a
CodeGraph audit failure item 3 becomes `CodeGraph Failures`. No push/MR items
are present on either failure.

## Non-Interactive Shell Commands

**ALWAYS use non-interactive flags** with file operations to avoid hanging on confirmation prompts.

Shell commands like `cp`, `mv`, and `rm` may be aliased to include `-i` (interactive) mode on some systems, causing the agent to hang indefinitely waiting for y/n input.

**Use these forms instead:**
```bash
# Force overwrite without prompting
cp -f source dest           # NOT: cp source dest
mv -f source dest           # NOT: mv source dest
rm -f file                  # NOT: rm file

# For recursive operations
rm -rf directory            # NOT: rm -r directory
cp -rf source dest          # NOT: cp -r source dest
```

**Other commands that may prompt:**
- `scp` - use `-o BatchMode=yes` for non-interactive
- `ssh` - use `-o BatchMode=yes` to fail instead of prompting
- `apt-get` - use `-y` flag
- `brew` - use `HOMEBREW_NO_AUTO_UPDATE=1` env var

## Session Completion

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File follow-up issues** via `mac task create` for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) — `scripts/run-contract-tests.sh`
3. **Update issue status** via `mac task close`
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** — MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
5. **Clean up** — clear stashes and verify the hub-owned branch reconciler with
   `mac repo refs status`. It retires eligible managed task refs automatically;
   use `mac repo refs audit --repo .` for diagnosis and manual executable prune
   only for refs the same lifecycle policy marks eligible
6. **Verify** all changes committed AND pushed
7. **Hand off** context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing — that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" — YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds
