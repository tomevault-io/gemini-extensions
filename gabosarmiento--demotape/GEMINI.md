Guidance for AI coding agents working on **DemoTape** — build, run, verify, troubleshoot.
(For contribution process, PR standards, and review expectations, see `CONTRIBUTING.md`.)

## What this is

A native macOS menu-bar screen recorder (Swift + AppKit + AVFoundation + Core Image/Metal)
that auto-styles recordings (auto-zoom, smooth cursor, webcam, framed backgrounds) and
exports lightweight web MP4s. **No external dependencies** — Apple frameworks only. **No
Xcode project** — it's a Swift Package built from the command line.

## Prerequisites

- macOS **12.3+** (Intel or Apple Silicon)
- Xcode **Command Line Tools**: `xcode-select --install`
- Optional: `gh` for release tasks

## Build, run, verify

```bash
# Compile (fast feedback; use this to check your changes build)
swift build -c release

# Run the unit tests (pure logic: caption parsing, SRT/VTT formatting, endpoints)
swift test

# One-time: create the stable self-signed signing identity ("DemoTape Dev").
# Required so macOS remembers Screen Recording permission across rebuilds.
./create-identity.sh

# Package + sign + install to /Applications, then launch
./build-app.sh release
open /Applications/DemoTape.app
```

> Always run the app from **/Applications** (build-app.sh installs it there). macOS grants
> Screen Recording permission unreliably to apps in Desktop/Documents/Downloads.

## Agent-assisted setup for a tester (run this on the tester's Mac)

This is the recommended way to try DemoTape without a notarized download. Building on the
tester's own machine produces a **native-arch** binary (no Rosetta), signs it with a **stable
local identity** (so Screen Recording permission survives updates), and involves **no
Gatekeeper/quarantine prompt** because nothing is downloaded and run — it's built locally.

**If you are the human tester:** paste the prompt below to your coding agent (Claude Code,
Codex, etc.) from inside a clone of this repo, and let it run the steps.

> Set up and install DemoTape on my Mac by following the "Agent-assisted setup for a tester"
> runbook in AGENTS.md. Run the commands, check each precondition, tell me exactly when you
> need me to click something in System Settings, and stop with a clear message if any step
> fails.

**If you are the agent, run these steps in order and verify each one:**

```bash
# 0. Preconditions ----------------------------------------------------------
sw_vers -productVersion            # must be >= 12.3; abort with a message if lower
uname -m                           # arm64 (Apple Silicon) or x86_64 (Intel) — just informational
xcode-select -p >/dev/null 2>&1 || xcode-select --install   # installs Command Line Tools if missing
#   If it launched the CLT installer, STOP and tell the user to finish the GUI
#   installer, then re-run. Do not proceed until `xcode-select -p` succeeds.

#   IMPORTANT: `xcode-select -p` only proves the *path* is set — it does NOT prove
#   the toolchain is healthy. A partially corrupted Command Line Tools install
#   (common after a macOS upgrade) can pass every check above and still fail the
#   build with the cryptic error `no such module 'PackageDescription'` /
#   `Invalid manifest`. `swift --version` and even `swift package --version` still
#   succeed in that state, so they are NOT reliable checks. The only reliable test
#   is actually compiling a manifest — do that in a throwaway package:
_dt_probe="$(mktemp -d)"; printf '// swift-tools-version:5.7\nimport PackageDescription\nlet package = Package(name: "probe")\n' > "${_dt_probe}/Package.swift"
if ! swift package --package-path "${_dt_probe}" dump-package >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    rm -rf "${_dt_probe}"
    echo "SwiftPM cannot compile a manifest — your Command Line Tools install is corrupted"
    echo "(the PackageDescription module is missing). Fix it, then re-run this runbook:"
    echo "  sudo rm -rf /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools && xcode-select --install"
    echo "If that does not resolve it, install full Xcode and select it:"
    echo "  sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app"
    exit 1
fi
rm -rf "${_dt_probe}"
#   See the 'no such module PackageDescription' entry under Troubleshooting below.

# 1. Build + verify ---------------------------------------------------------
swift build -c release             # must succeed
swift test                         # 386 tests; all must pass (pure logic, no GUI/network)

# 2. Stable signing identity (one-time; persists Screen Recording permission) --
security find-identity -v -p codesigning | grep -q "DemoTape Dev" || ./create-identity.sh

# 3. Package + sign + install to /Applications ------------------------------
./build-app.sh release             # assembles .app, signs with "DemoTape Dev", installs
open /Applications/DemoTape.app    # a record icon appears in the menu bar
```

**Then hand off to the human for the one-time macOS permission grant (the agent cannot click
these):**

1. Click the DemoTape menu-bar icon and press **Start** once. macOS shows a Screen Recording
   prompt.
2. Open **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Screen Recording**, enable **DemoTape**.
3. **Quit and reopen** DemoTape (required — macOS only applies the grant on relaunch).
4. Microphone / Camera / Accessibility are prompted only if the tester enables those features.

**Notes for the agent:**
- Do **not** use `make-dmg.sh` for a local tester — that path is ad-hoc signed and loses the
  Screen Recording grant on every update. The `build-app.sh` + `create-identity.sh` path above
  keeps the grant stable.
- This flow needs no notarization, no Apple Developer account, and produces a binary matching
  the tester's own CPU architecture.
- To update later, just `git pull` and re-run step 3. The permission persists because the
  signing identity is unchanged.
- If you want to smoke-test the render pipeline without granting Screen Recording, use the
  headless hooks in the next section.

### Verifying render changes WITHOUT screen-recording permission

The binary has headless hooks so you can test the rendering/encoding pipeline on existing
files (no TCC prompts, no GUI):

```bash
# Re-render a raw recording (.mov + its .events.json sidecar) into a styled .mp4
./.build/release/DemoTape --render "path/to/recording.mov" /tmp/out.mp4

# REVISE a video without re-recording. Every styling decision lives in `recipe.json`, saved
# beside each recording — the raw .mov + .events.json are lossless ground truth, so the styled
# video can always be re-derived. This is why DemoTape needs no timeline editor: the timeline is
# data. Fields are all optional ("leave the default"), so a revision is a 1-key patch.
./.build/release/DemoTape --show-recipe                          # full default recipe (field names)
./.build/release/DemoTape --show-recipe "path/to/recording-dir"  # the recipe that made that video
echo '{ "maxZoom": 1.4, "exportSize": "1080x1350" }' > /tmp/patch.json
./.build/release/DemoTape --render "path/to/.source/base.mov" /tmp/revised.mp4 --recipe /tmp/patch.json
#   A recipe beside the recording is applied automatically; --recipe overrides it. Misspelled keys
#   are REPORTED ("recipe warning: ignoring unknown key(s): …") rather than silently dropped — if
#   you see that warning, the change did not happen.

# Transcode a styled .mp4 down to a web tier (height in px)
./.build/release/DemoTape --transcode "path/to/styled.mp4" 540 /tmp/web-540.mp4

# Grab a still to LOOK at. You cannot check a recording by reading a log — whether the pointer
# landed on the button, whether the zoom framed the right thing, whether a caption overlaps the
# UI are visual facts. One timestamp writes exactly that path; several write into a folder.
./.build/release/DemoTape --frame "path/to/styled.mp4" 6.1 /tmp/frame.png
./.build/release/DemoTape --frame "path/to/styled.mp4" 2,6.1,11.4 /tmp/frames [maxHeight]

# Run the FULL Web Publish pipeline headlessly — the same code path the GUI's
# "Web Publish" window uses, so scripted output matches what a user gets by clicking
# Export. Writes <name>-web/ with an mp4 per tier, poster.jpg, embed.html and demo.gif.
#   --publish <styled.mp4> [heights=720,540,360] [gifWidth=640] [gifFps=10]
./.build/release/DemoTape --publish "path/to/styled.mp4"
./.build/release/DemoTape --publish "path/to/styled.mp4" 540,360 560 8

# Generate .srt + .vtt captions (opt-in AI, bring-your-own-key). Reads the key from
# the environment so it needs no GUI/Keychain. Requires network + a valid key.
DEMOTAPE_STT_KEY=sk-... ./.build/release/DemoTape --captions "path/to/styled.mp4"
#   Optional: DEMOTAPE_STT_BASEURL (default https://api.openai.com/v1),
#             DEMOTAPE_STT_MODEL (default whisper-1), DEMOTAPE_STT_LANG (e.g. en)

# Burn cached captions into a new <name>.captioned.mp4 (no network; uses the
# transcript.json cache or an existing .srt).
./.build/release/DemoTape --burn "path/to/styled.mp4"

# List ElevenLabs voices, and generate a voiceover (BYO ElevenLabs key). Requires network.
DEMOTAPE_ELEVEN_KEY=sk_... ./.build/release/DemoTape --voices
DEMOTAPE_ELEVEN_KEY=sk_... ./.build/release/DemoTape --voiceover "path/to/styled.mp4" script.txt [voiceId]

# TTS is pluggable — `--tts`/`--voiceover` pick a backend from DEMOTAPE_TTS_PROVIDER:
#   ElevenLabs (default) | OpenAI-compatible | Custom. Run a local server (see tools/tts-shim)
#   for free, offline narration with NO paid key:
DEMOTAPE_TTS_PROVIDER=OpenAI-compatible DEMOTAPE_TTS_BASEURL=http://localhost:8880/v1 \
  DEMOTAPE_TTS_MODEL=kokoro DEMOTAPE_TTS_VOICE=af_bella \
  ./.build/release/DemoTape --tts script.txt /tmp/vo.mp3
```

DemoTape is **free and open source (MIT)** — no license gate. The paid/facilitated artifact is
just the convenience of a prebuilt **notarized DMG** (`release-notarized.sh`); anyone can build
from source for free.

Recordings live in `~/Movies/DemoTape/` (`*.mov` raw, `*.events.json` sidecar,
`*.styled.mp4` output, `*.cam.mov` webcam). A run log is at `~/Movies/DemoTape/demotape.log`.

## Hard constraints

- **Target macOS 12.3.** Do not use APIs newer than macOS 13 without an `@available` guard.
  ScreenCaptureKit is intentionally **avoided** — on the target Monterey/Intel hardware its
  `startCapture()` succeeds but delivers zero frames. Capture uses `AVCaptureScreenInput`.
- **No third-party dependencies.** Keep it Apple-frameworks-only and dependency-free.
- **Local by default.** The core recorder/render/publish path must make **no network
  requests**. Network is allowed only in explicitly opt-in AI features (e.g. captions in
  `Captions.swift`, TTS in `Voiceover.swift`), which talk only to the user-configured endpoint.
  These are **provider-pluggable**: STT and TTS each support a hosted paid option, an
  OpenAI-compatible endpoint, or a custom URL — so a user can run everything **locally/offline**
  by pointing the base URL at their own server (see `tools/tts-shim`). Keys are optional for local
  servers; when present they go in the **Keychain** (`Keychain.swift`), never UserDefaults.
- **Don't commit** recordings, `.app` bundles, `.build/`, or signing artifacts (see `.gitignore`).
- **Never push or create remotes** without the maintainer's explicit request.
- After any change, run `swift build -c release` and `swift test`. For render/encode changes,
  also verify with the `--render` / `--transcode` hooks above; for captions, `--captions`.
- **Add/extend tests** for new pure logic (parsing, formatting, URL building). Keep tests
  network-free — factor the testable logic out of the network call (see `Captions.parseCues`
  / `transcriptionEndpoint`).

## Troubleshooting

### Screen Recording shows "not granted" even though it's ticked in System Settings

Almost always a **duplicate bundle** problem: more than one `DemoTape.app` with the same
bundle id (`dev.demotape.app`) is registered with LaunchServices — e.g. the installed
`/Applications` copy plus a leftover staging copy in the project folder or one in the Trash.
macOS then binds the Screen Recording grant to the wrong copy, so the running app never sees
it. (Microphone/Camera/Accessibility still work because the app requests those itself at
runtime and binds them correctly.)

Confirm the duplicates:

```bash
LSR="/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Versions/A/Support/lsregister"
"$LSR" -dump | grep -i "demotape.app (" | sort -u   # should list ONE path: /Applications/DemoTape.app
```

Fix:

```bash
# 1. Delete every DemoTape.app that is NOT in /Applications (project folder, Trash, Downloads…).
# 2. Re-register just the installed one, and reset the stale grant:
"$LSR" -f /Applications/DemoTape.app
tccutil reset ScreenCapture dev.demotape.app
```

Then reopen DemoTape and grant fresh. If the checkbox still won't "take", remove DemoTape from
the Screen Recording list, click **+**, and add `/Applications/DemoTape.app` explicitly, then
quit and reopen. `build-app.sh` now deletes its staging bundle after install to prevent this —
**always run DemoTape from `/Applications`, never a copy in another folder.**

### `no such module 'PackageDescription'` / `Invalid manifest`

`swift build` fails immediately while compiling `Package.swift`, e.g.:

```
error: 'demotape': Invalid manifest
Package.swift:2:8: error: no such module 'PackageDescription'
```

**Cause:** a corrupted or incomplete **Command Line Tools** install, most often
triggered by a **recent macOS upgrade**. The SwiftPM manifest API files
(`PackageDescription.swiftinterface` / `.swiftmodule`) are missing from
`…/CommandLineTools/usr/lib/swift/pm/ManifestAPI/` even though `swiftc` compiles a plain
file fine and `xcode-select -p` succeeds. Note that `swift --version` and
`swift package --version` also still succeed in this state — they do **not** detect the
problem. Confirm with either of these instead:

```bash
# The ManifestAPI dir should contain a .swiftinterface/.swiftmodule, not just the .dylib:
ls /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/lib/swift/pm/ManifestAPI
# Or actually try to compile a manifest (fails when broken):
swift package dump-package >/dev/null    # run from any package dir
```

**Fix (in order of preference):**

1. Reinstall the Command Line Tools, then finish the GUI installer that appears:
   ```bash
   sudo rm -rf /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools
   xcode-select --install
   ```
   Note: `xcode-select --install` alone is a no-op if the tools directory still exists
   ("already installed") — the `sudo rm -rf` first is what forces a genuinely fresh
   download.

2. **If the reinstall still doesn't fix it, install full Xcode from the App Store.** This
   is the reliable fix — some machines keep getting a Command Line Tools payload without
   the SwiftPM manifest module no matter how many times you reinstall, but full Xcode
   ships a complete, self-contained toolchain that includes it. Confirmed in practice on
   macOS 12.7.6 / Intel: after installing Xcode 14.2, its toolchain **has** the module the
   broken CLT lacked:
   ```bash
   # Xcode's toolchain includes PackageDescription.swiftmodule (the CLT was missing it):
   ls /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/lib/swift/pm/ManifestAPI/
   #   -> PackageDescription.swiftmodule   libPackageDescription.dylib   (both present)

   # Point the active toolchain at Xcode, accept its license, and verify:
   sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app
   sudo xcodebuild -license accept
   swift package dump-package >/dev/null && echo "SwiftPM OK"   # run from any package dir
   ```
   Full Xcode is **not** normally required to build DemoTape (a healthy Command Line Tools
   install is enough), and it is **free** — no paid Apple Developer account is needed. It's
   only the fallback for when the lighter Command Line Tools install stays broken. Xcode is
   large (~12 GB+ on disk, plus download/expansion headroom), so free up space first if the
   volume is tight.

Re-run the runbook from step 0 afterward.

## Where things live

See the "Project layout" section in `README.md`. Key files:
`AppDelegate.swift` (menu + orchestration), `RecordingEngine.swift` (capture),
`EventRecorder.swift` (mouse/keyboard timeline), `VideoRenderer.swift` (styled render),
`Transcoder.swift` (web export), `FocusTimeline.swift` (auto-zoom model).
