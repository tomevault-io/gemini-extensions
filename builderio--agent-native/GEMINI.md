# Agent-Native Framework

## Core Philosophy

Agent-native is a framework for building apps where the AI agent and the UI are equal partners. Everything the UI can do, the agent can do. Everything the agent can do, the UI can do. They share the same database, the same state, and they always stay in sync.

The agent can also see what the user is looking at. If an email is open, the agent knows which email. If a slide is selected, the agent knows which slide. If the user selects text and hits Cmd+I to focus the agent, the agent knows what text is selected and can act on just that.

## The Six Rules

1. **Data lives in SQL** — via Drizzle ORM. Any SQL database (SQLite/Postgres/D1/Turso/Supabase/Neon). See `portability` skill.
2. **All AI goes through the agent chat** — the UI never calls an LLM directly. Use `sendToAgentChat()`. See `delegate-to-agent`.
3. **Actions are the single source of truth** — define once in `actions/`; the agent calls them as tools, the frontend calls them as HTTP endpoints at `/_agent-native/actions/:name`. See `actions`.
4. **Polling keeps the UI in sync** — `useDbSync()` polls `/_agent-native/poll` every 2s and invalidates React Query caches. Works on all serverless/edge hosts. See `real-time-sync`.
5. **The agent can modify code** — components, routes, styles, actions. Design expecting this. See `self-modifying-code`.
6. **Application state in SQL** — ephemeral UI state in `application_state`. Both sides read and write. See `storing-data`.

## Adding a Feature — The Four Areas

Every new feature MUST update all four areas. Skipping any one breaks the agent-native contract. See `adding-a-feature` for the full checklist.

1. **UI** — the user-facing component/route/page
2. **Actions** — operations in `actions/` using `defineAction` (serve both agent and frontend)
3. **Skills / Instructions** — update AGENTS.md and/or add a skill if the feature introduces a pattern
4. **Application State** — expose navigation and selection so the agent knows what the user sees

If a feature needs user-facing setup (API keys, OAuth), register an onboarding step. See `onboarding`.

MCP servers reach the agent from three sources: local stdio servers in `mcp.config.json`, remote HTTP servers added per-user or per-org via the settings UI, and the workspace MCP hub (Dispatch template) when enabled. Tools appear in the registry prefixed `mcp__<server-id>__`. Compose with them where possible (e.g. delegate browser automation to `mcp__claude-in-chrome__*`).

## Project Structure

```
app/                   # React frontend
  root.tsx             # HTML shell + global providers
  routes/              # File-based page routes
  components/          # UI components
  hooks/               # React hooks (including use-navigation-state.ts)
server/                # Nitro API server
  routes/api/          # Custom API routes (file uploads, streaming, webhooks only)
  plugins/             # Server plugins (startup logic)
  db/                  # Drizzle schema + DB connection
actions/               # App operations (agent tools + auto-mounted HTTP endpoints)
.generated/            # Auto-generated types (action-types.d.ts) — gitignored
.agents/skills/        # Agent skills — detailed guidance for patterns
```

## Skills

Agent skills in `.agents/skills/` provide detailed guidance. Read the relevant skill before making changes — these are the source of truth for how to do things in this codebase.

## All-Agent Support

`AGENTS.md` is the universal standard. It works with any AI coding tool. The framework creates symlinks so every tool reads the same instructions:

- `CLAUDE.md` → `AGENTS.md` (Claude Code)
- `.claude/skills/` → `.agents/skills/` (Claude Code skills)

Run `agent-native setup-agents` to create all symlinks (done automatically by `agent-native create`).

## Conventions

- **Actions first** — use `defineAction` for new operations; only create `/api/` routes for file uploads, streaming, webhooks, or OAuth callbacks.
- **TypeScript everywhere** — all code must be `.ts`/`.tsx`. Never `.js` or `.mjs`.
- **Prettier** — run `npx prettier --write <files>` after modifying source files.
- **Client-side rendering** — all app content renders client-side via the `ClientOnly` wrapper in `root.tsx`.
- **shadcn/ui components** for standard UI. Check `app/components/ui/` before building custom.
- **Tabler Icons** (`@tabler/icons-react`) for all icons. **Never use emojis as icons** — not in buttons, not in avatars, not in labels, not in toasts/notifications, not in outbound messages (Slack, email). No other icon libraries, no inline SVGs. Emojis are fine when they are _user-authored content_ (a document title emoji picker, a reaction the user chose, a user-picked space icon) — the rule is about icons the UI picks, not data the user picks.
- **No browser dialogs** — use shadcn AlertDialog instead of `window.confirm/alert/prompt`.
- **No breaking database changes — ever.** Hosted templates share their prod DB across every deploy context (preview, branch, prod). Any destructive SQL that runs in any build will overwrite live user data. Symptoms we've already hit in production: users losing accounts, dashboards silently emptied, sessions invalidated. Hard rules:
  - **Schema edits must be strictly additive.** Add new columns/tables, never rename or drop. If a column is wrong, add the replacement alongside it, dual-write from the application, migrate readers, and only retire the old column once every deploy that reads it is gone. Same for tables.
  - **Never rename an existing table or column** in a single step — not via Drizzle, not via raw SQL, not via `drizzle-kit push`. A rename looks like drop+create to the diff tool and wipes the table.
  - **Do not use `drizzle-kit push` against production databases.** Template schemas only define domain tables, not framework tables (`user`, `session`, `account`, `application_state`, etc.). Push sees the framework tables as "not in schema" and drops them. Schema changes go through `runMigrations` in each template's `server/plugins/db.ts` — additive SQL only.
  - **No `DROP TABLE`, no `DROP COLUMN`, no `TRUNCATE`, no `DELETE` without a WHERE, no destructive `ALTER`** in any migration, plugin startup, or action. Not even with `IF EXISTS`. If you think you need one, stop and ask.
  - **No auth-adapter swaps without a data-migration plan.** Switching auth libraries or renaming identity tables (e.g. plural `users/sessions/accounts` → singular `user/session/account`) leaves the new tables empty and strands every existing user's identity. If auth tables change shape, a data-copy migration ships in the same change and is verified against a staging DB first.
  - **Skip schema changes entirely when in doubt.** A redundant column alongside an old one is cheap; breaking live data is not recoverable beyond Neon's 6-hour PITR window.
- **Optimistic UI by default** — the UI must feel instant. NEVER `await` a server round-trip before updating the screen or navigating. Default pattern for any mutation:
  1. Generate a client-side id (nanoid) if the new entity needs one.
  2. Update the React Query cache optimistically via `queryClient.setQueryData(...)` (or the mutation's `onMutate`).
  3. Navigate / close the dialog / show the new row **immediately**.
  4. Fire the mutation in the background; in `onError` roll back the cache + toast, in `onSuccess` replace optimistic entry with server value.
  5. Never block a click with a spinner unless the user is performing a destructive/irreversible action (payment, delete, publish).
     Same for navigation: a link click must navigate on press — never `await` a fetch before `navigate()`. Preload data into the cache first (via `queryClient.prefetchQuery` on hover/focus) if the target page depends on it. Treat any "loading spinner after click" as a bug to fix, not a feature.

## Auto-Memory

The agent proactively saves learnings to `LEARNINGS.md` when users correct it, share preferences, or reveal patterns. This is part of the system prompt in `agent-chat-plugin.ts` (FRAMEWORK_CORE section).
