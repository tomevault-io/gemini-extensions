# sbproxy (Rust workspace)
*Last modified: 2026-06-17*

The active implementation of sbproxy. Cargo workspace with ~20
crates under `crates/`, an e2e suite under `e2e/`, examples under
`examples/`, and an internal observability/cache/AI/security stack.

## Pre-commit checks

Before committing any change, run all checks. Each one corresponds to a
required CI gate; if any fails locally, CI will fail too.

| Check | Command |
|---|---|
| Format | `cargo fmt --all -- --check` |
| Build | `cargo build --workspace` |
| Test | `cargo nextest run --workspace --exclude sbproxy-e2e --locked --profile ci` |
| Doctest | `cargo test --workspace --exclude sbproxy-e2e --locked --doc` |
| Clippy | `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` |
| Docs | `RUSTDOCFLAGS="-D warnings" cargo doc --workspace --no-deps --document-private-items` |

Fix the issue before pushing. Do not paper over with `#[allow(...)]`
unless you also write a one-line comment explaining the deliberate
exception.

The equivalent local runner is `scripts/check.sh`. It uses
`cargo-nextest` when installed (`cargo install cargo-nextest --locked`)
and falls back to plain `cargo test` otherwise. The default path mirrors
the required PR lane: non-e2e workspace tests in the dev profile plus
doctests. This keeps the local target directory materially smaller than
full release/e2e runs. Set `SBPROXY_RELEASE_TESTS=1` to compile test
binaries in release mode, and `SBPROXY_CHECK_E2E=1` to include the
`sbproxy-e2e` package.

By default, `scripts/check.sh` runs `scripts/cleanup-build-artifacts.sh`
on exit to prune `target/doc`, nextest output, incremental directories,
and other high-churn artifacts while keeping dependency build outputs
available for reuse. Set `SBPROXY_CLEAN_AFTER_BUILD=0` only when you
are deliberately preserving every artifact for local debugging.

## Faster inner-loop alternatives

For day-to-day editing, these run in seconds against just the slice
you're working in:

- `cargo check -p <crate>` - single-crate type check, ~1-5s
- `cargo test -p <crate> --lib <prefix>` - unit tests by name prefix
- `cargo test -p sbproxy-config --tests` - config tests + example +
  v1-compat sweep, ~3s
- `cargo test -p sbproxy-modules --lib <policy_name>` - per-policy
  unit tests
- `cargo test -p sbproxy-e2e --release --test <name>` - one e2e test
  file (release build of the proxy is reused if present)

## Module system

Caddy-style. Each module under `crates/sbproxy-modules/src/{action,
auth,policy,transform}/` registers itself via `init()` into the
`pkg/plugin` registry. The config compiler discovers modules by name
at config-load time. Adding a new module:

1. Create the module file, define its config struct, implement the
   relevant trait (`PolicyEnforcer`, `ActionHandler`, `AuthProvider`,
   `TransformHandler`, `RequestEnricher`).
2. Register via `plugin::Register{Policy,Action,Auth,Transform,Enricher}`
   in `init()`.
3. Add a blank import to `crates/sbproxy-modules/src/imports.rs`.
4. Run the four pre-commit checks.

## Compiled handler chain

`crates/sbproxy-config/src/compiler.rs` builds each origin's handler
chain inside-out (auth, response cache, transforms, callbacks,
modifiers, policies, etc.). The chain compiles once per origin and
caches; per-request execution does no allocation in the
chain-construction path.

## Conventions

- The public API surface is the following three crates, and only
  these three. Internal crates must not be imported from them, and
  no other crate in this workspace is part of the public surface
  today.
  - `sbproxy-plugin` - public plugin trait surface (`PolicyEnforcer`,
    `ActionHandler`, `AuthProvider`, `TransformHandler`,
    `RequestEnricher`, registry).
  - `sbproxy-config` - config schema and `compile_config()` entry
    point.
  - `sbproxy-httpkit` - HTTP request/response helpers shared by
    plugin authors.

  Two further public crates are planned but not yet shipped:
  - `sbproxy-events` (planned) - until it lands, events and metrics
    are reached through `sbproxy-observe`, which is treated as
    internal.
  - `sbproxy-proxy` (planned) - until it lands, the request
    pipeline lives in `sbproxy-core` plus the `sbproxy` binary,
    both also treated as internal.

  Do not advertise the two planned crates as available; reach for
  the `sbproxy-observe` / `sbproxy-core` analogs in the interim and
  expect the seam to move when the planned crates ship.
- Storage stack: `redb` for embedded KV, SQLite for relational, and
  `memory / file / memcached / redis` for the response cache. Pebble
  is Go-only and is not used in this workspace.
- All examples in `examples/` use `test.sbproxy.dev` as the upstream
  hostname placeholder.
- No em-dashes in any user-facing content (docs, README, CHANGELOG,
  rustdoc, commit messages).
- The marketing site at `www.sbproxy.dev` is language-agnostic; do
  not lead with "Rust" there. The README and technical docs in this
  repo can.
- This repo is OSS-only. Closed-source features extend the runtime
  via the `sbproxy-plugin` trait registry; never add a direct
  dependency on a closed-source crate, and do not name closed-source
  crate paths in this repo's docs or rustdoc. The single exception is
  `docs/enterprise.md`, which is the buyer-facing landing page that
  describes the OSS / enterprise split.

## Docs convention

`docs/` is flat: lowercase-hyphenated filenames at the top level, no
subdirectories, no per-crate READMEs. Every doc starts with a level-1
title, then `*Last modified: YYYY-MM-DD*` on the next line. The index
of doc slugs lives in `docs/README.md` and in the marketing site's
`src/data/docsNavigation.js` and must stay in sync.

Buyer-facing reference docs live here: `architecture.md`,
`ai-gateway.md`, `configuration.md`, `scripting.md`,
`openapi-emission.md`, `glossary.md`. The `upgrade.md` file is the
only place archived-Go references are allowed.

Public install + extension story is configuration, not Rust traits.
Surface curl, Homebrew, and Docker for install; surface CEL, Lua,
JavaScript, and WebAssembly for extension. Do not push readers at
`cargo install` or "implement this trait" from buyer-facing docs.

## Cutover state

The active git history of this Rust implementation starts at `v1.0.0`.
The Go implementation shipped publicly as `v0.1.0` through `v0.1.2`
and is archived at `github.com/soapbucket/sbproxy-go`. See
`MIGRATION.md` for upgrade guidance.

The internal config schema is independently versioned and is referred
to as `schema-v1`; the same schema is supported by both the Go
`v0.1.x` line and the Rust `v1.x` line. The compatibility promise is
pinned by the `v1_compat::v1_fixtures_compile_unmodified` test in
`crates/sbproxy-config/`. Do not conflate `schema-v1` with binary
`v1.0`; the schema label predates this rename and is intentionally
unchanged.

## License + attribution

Apache License 2.0 (`LICENSE`). Open source; free for any use,
including production and commercial, with no field-of-use restriction.

When adding or upgrading a dependency licensed **only** under Apache
2.0 (not dual MIT/Apache-2.0), update the `NOTICE` file in the same
commit; Apache 2.0 §4 requires those attribution entries. Easier to
keep the file correct as you go than to reconstruct it later.

### Verifying NOTICE coverage

Run this from the workspace root before opening a PR that touches
`Cargo.toml` or `Cargo.lock`. It diffs the current Apache-2.0-only
dep set against the names already mentioned in `NOTICE` and prints any
gap. Zero output means the file is current.

```bash
cargo metadata --format-version 1 --all-features 2>/dev/null \
  | python3 -c '
import json, sys, re
m = json.load(sys.stdin)
ws = set(m["workspace_members"])
notice = open("NOTICE").read().lower()
for p in m["packages"]:
    if p["id"] in ws: continue
    lic = (p.get("license") or "").strip()
    parts = [x.strip() for x in re.split(r"\s+(?:OR|/)\s+", lic.replace("/", " OR "))]
    apache_only = ("Apache-2.0" in parts and "MIT" not in parts
                   and not any(x.startswith("Apache-2.0 WITH") for x in parts)
                   and "BSL-1.0" not in parts and "CC0-1.0" not in parts)
    if apache_only and p["name"].lower() not in notice:
        print(f"  {p[\"name\"]:<40} {p[\"version\"]:<14} {lic}")
'
```

If any line prints, add an attribution stanza to `NOTICE` for each
named crate (Apache 2.0 §4(d) requires the copyright notice and the
URL of the project's source). Dev-dependencies that are Apache-only
should also be listed (mark them "Used as a dev-dependency in test
fixtures only" so the intent is clear). The check is conservative;
err on the side of attributing rather than skipping.

Commercial licensing inquiries: `legal@soapbucket.com`. Trademark
policy is in `TRADEMARKS.md`. Copyright holder is Soap Bucket LLC.
