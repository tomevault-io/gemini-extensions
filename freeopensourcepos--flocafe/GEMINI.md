# FloCafe agent guide

FloCafe is an open-source, offline-first Electron desktop POS.

## Orientation & layout

- **Main process (`main/`):** Electron lifecycle and IPC (`main/index.ts`), Express API on `:3001` (`main/server.ts`), standalone KDS server on `:3002` (`main/kds.ts`), Server App on `:3003` (`main/server-app.ts`), SQLite database access via `better-sqlite3`, ESC/POS printing, and background services.
- **Frontend (`frontend/src/`):** Next.js 16 and React 19 application (statically exported via `output: 'export'` when `NEXT_BUILD_MODE=desktop`, or standard server runtime when unset), Zustand state, UI components, and translations.
- **Tests (`tests/`):** Backend unit, integration, and release test suites.
- **Documentation (`docs/`):** Design specs and audits (see [docs/README.md](docs/README.md)).
- **Workflows (`.github/`):** Issue/PR templates, CODEOWNERS, and CI/CD workflows.

## Progressive disclosure & source of truth

Before starting non-trivial work:
1. **Understand task scope:** Read the task and any linked issue/PR, then identify scope and acceptance criteria. For minor typos or isolated one-line edits, formal planning is not required.
2. **Consult documentation index:** Check [docs/README.md](docs/README.md) to locate relevant `CURRENT` or `ACTIVE DESIGN` documents. Documents marked `ACTIVE DESIGN` or `FORWARD-LOOKING` describe target architecture and may be ahead of current code; `HISTORICAL` docs provide context only.
3. **Check business decisions:** If the task touches authorization, access control, defaults, or other product-behavior rules, check [docs/business-decisions.md](docs/business-decisions.md) — it is a verifiable log of deliberate product decisions that a plausible-looking implementation can easily contradict. If a task seems to require deviating from an entry there, stop and confirm with the user rather than assuming the decision is stale.
4. **Inspect current code:** Active runtime code and automated tests define current behavior. If a task or design doc contradicts current code or references non-existent files, report the discrepancy rather than inventing unapproved architecture.
5. **Identify tests:** Locate existing coverage in `tests/`, `frontend/`, and any subsystem-local test directories relevant to the change.
6. **Plan and execute:** Keep changes focused on the approved task.

**Conflict precedence:** The approved task defines the intended change. Current code and tests define existing behavior. `AGENTS.md` and business decisions define boundaries the implementation must not violate.

## Core invariants

1. **Offline-first operation:** Core POS operation (orders, billing, KDS, printing) must function without internet connectivity. Optional network features (Google Drive, WhatsApp, cloud reporting) run only when explicitly configured and must fail gracefully when offline.
2. **Data safety:** Existing customer data must survive upgrades. Never reset, truncate, or drop user databases as a shortcut for migration design.
3. **Architecture boundaries:** UI language, tenant regional settings, and tax/compliance behavior are separate, decoupled domains.
4. **Business timestamps:** Persisted timestamps follow FloCafe's canonical storage conventions; configured store timezone applies to business-local presentation, day/shift boundaries, and reporting intervals.
5. **Backend authority:** Security-critical, payment, and tax calculations remain backend-authoritative.
6. **Orders are never ownership-gated:** FloCafe is an open system for order visibility — any staff role with order access can see and act on any order, regardless of who created it. Authorization is restricted by role (page/feature access) and by specific action (e.g. KDS stage transitions are chef/manager/owner-only, narrowed further by station/category assignment), never by comparing `order.user_id`/item creator against the current user. Accountability comes from audit attribution (every write is recorded against the authenticated actor), not from hiding orders between staff. Do not add or reintroduce a `role === 'server' && order.user_id !== user.userId`-style check anywhere in the backend; see `docs/business-decisions.md` and `docs/roles-and-permissions.md`.
7. **Reuse before adding:** Reuse existing helpers, utilities, and dependencies before introducing new packages.
8. **Scope discipline:** Implement only the approved task. Do not make opportunistic refactors across unrelated files.

## Sharp edges & operational rules

- **Desktop static export boundary:** When building for desktop (`NEXT_BUILD_MODE=desktop`), `frontend/` is exported as static HTML/CSS/JS (`output: 'export'`). In desktop mode, there is no runtime Next.js server-side execution, Next.js API routes, or server cookies; all dynamic backend logic belongs in Express (`:3001`) or Electron IPC. Standard Next.js server runtime (`next start`) applies only when `NEXT_BUILD_MODE` is unset (cloud mode).
- **Port contention on dev/test:** Daemons hold ports `:3001` (API), `:3002` (KDS), and `:3003` (Server App). If commands fail with `EADDRINUSE`, run `npm run clean` (`node kill-ports.js 3001 3002 3003`) to clear them before proceeding.
- **Playwright configuration context:** End-to-end tests live inside `frontend/`. Running `npx playwright test` directly from root fails because `playwright.config.ts` is in `frontend/`. Use `npm run test:e2e:browser` from root or run Playwright from within `frontend/`.
- **Match compatibility effort to demonstrated migration risk:** Do not add multi-layer compatibility state solely to preserve minor legacy behavior without evidence that users depend on it. Prefer simple, reconfigurable defaults when the migration impact is small. If compatibility requires substantial state or branching, stop and confirm the tradeoff first.
- **Review quota & push batching:** CodeRabbit and Greptile have hourly review limits. Batch all outstanding review fixes into a single verified push rather than pushing once per finding. After a second automated-review finding on code you just patched, stop and reconsider the design before patching a third time.
- **No unapproved mutations:** Do not create, edit, close, label, or assign GitHub issues or PRs unless explicitly instructed. Do not commit, tag, push, merge, or enable auto-merge without explicit instruction. Ambiguous future-state wording such as "once green it will merge" is not authorization to perform the action.
- **Secrets & data protection:** Never commit credentials, API keys, `.env` files, customer data, backups, internal URLs, or private tokens.
- **Private specs boundary:** Never add the private `specs` repository as a submodule, build dependency, CI dependency, or runtime dependency.
- **Security checks:** Do not bypass platform or OS security checks merely to make a local development binary run.
- **Legacy code check:** Before modifying legacy-looking files, verify they are part of the active build, import, or packaging path (search imports, routes, and `package.json`).
- **Discovered issues:** Note adjacent bugs or potential improvements in your report rather than expanding implementation scope.
- **Changelog & commit governance:** Use Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `docs:`, `ci:`). Release notes and `CHANGELOG.md` are automated via `git-cliff` (`npm run changelog`) and CI; do not manually draft changelogs.
- **Code comments:** Code should be self-explanatory; write comments only when strictly necessary to explain non-obvious intent or rationale. Keep comments concise (1-2 lines maximum), and avoid historical tags (PR/issue numbers, phases) or redundant descriptions of what the code is doing.
- **Dependencies:** Evaluate built-in Node/Electron/browser APIs and existing project packages before proposing new dependencies.

## Commands

FloCafe requires **Node.js 22 or later**.

```sh
npm run clean            # Kill processes holding ports 3001, 3002, 3003
npm run dev              # Full Electron app (cleans ports, builds frontend & backend)
node dev-server.js       # Backend only (Express API on :3001, KDS on :3002, Server App on :3003)
npm run dev:frontend     # Frontend browser development server
npm run lint             # Lint backend (main/) and frontend (frontend/)
npm run build            # Compile TypeScript backend to dist/
npm run build:frontend   # Build and export static Next.js frontend
npm test                 # Run standard test suite
npm run test:url-allowlist
npm run audit:db
npm run i18n:check
npm run test:e2e:browser # E2E tests (runs Playwright from frontend/)
npm run i18n:add -- de   # scaffold an approved new language locally
```

## Verification

Before reporting completion, run every applicable minimum check below for implementation work and executable code reviews. Do not substitute manual inspection, transpilation, or a narrower check for a listed command; if a check cannot run, report it as not run and disclose why.

| Change type | Minimum verification |
| --- | --- |
| Documentation / templates | `git diff --check` and relative markdown link verification |
| Frontend | `npm run lint` and `npm run build:frontend` |
| Translations / i18n | `npm run i18n:check` |
| Backend / API | `npm run lint`, `npm run build`, and focused test suites |
| Database migrations | Fresh database test and upgrade-path migration test |
| E2E / Browser flows | `npm run test:e2e:browser` |
| Tax / Auth / Security | Relevant focused test suite plus broader integration tests |
| Packaging / Releases | Target platform build commands and release checks |

Run `npm test` when a full validation pass is requested, before releases, or when changes touch multiple core subsystems.
