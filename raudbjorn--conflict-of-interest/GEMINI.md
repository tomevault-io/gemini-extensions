# git-conflict-resolver

Mechanical conflict resolution is automated. Judgment is explicit. If intent
cannot be inferred, halt and ask.

For rationale and empirical grounding, read
`${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/design-rationale.md` only when needed.

## Constitutional Rules

Read `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/constitution.md`. These rules override this procedure:

1. No conflict markers in tracked source files.
2. No blanket resolution across human-authored files.
3. Halt when intent cannot be inferred for `other` files.

## Modes

Two entry points:

- **Resolve** (default): an operation is paused with conflicts. Follow the
  Procedure below.
- **Split** (`--split`, or a request to decompose an oversized PR/branch with no
  active conflict): propose smaller PRs along functional/structural boundaries.
  See "PR Decomposition" below. The Procedure's large-conflict gates also route
  here when a conflict is too large to resolve in place.

## Procedure

### Step 1 — Detect context

```bash
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/conflict-status.sh
```

Output: `context<TAB>progress<TAB>branch<TAB>unmerged_count`.

| Context | Unmerged | Argument | Action |
|---|---:|---|---|
| `none` | n/a | `--abort` | Report "no operation in progress" |
| `none` | n/a | none / `--continue` | Report "no conflicts" |
| active | n/a | `--abort` | `git <ctx> --abort` |
| active | 0 | any | `git <ctx> --continue` (merge: `git commit --no-edit`) |
| active | >0 | `--continue` | Continue without resolving |
| active | >0 | none | Proceed to Step 2 |

Abort recommendation criteria:

- rebase step has 20 or more conflicted files
- five or more consecutive rebase steps have conflicts
- same conflict reappears three or more times with rerere enabled

These are configurable heuristics, not empirical laws. See
`${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/recurring-conflicts.md`. When the unmerged count
is 20 or more, run
`${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/suggest-pr-split.sh --conflicts --scope both --json` before
categorizing. If high-confidence groups exist, recommend aborting and re-landing
as smaller PRs (refactor-baseline first); see
`${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/pr-decomposition.md`. This is advisory —
low-confidence (cross-cutting) groups are structural-only boundaries, not safe
splits.

### Step 2 — Categorize

```bash
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/categorize-conflicts.sh
```

Categories: `lockfile`, `migration`, `submodule`, `binary`, `generated`,
`snapshot`, `notebook`, `mergiraf`, `other`.

Report categorization before editing.

### Step 3 — Resolve by category

#### 3a. Lockfiles

Accept theirs to clear markers; regenerate in Step 5.

```bash
git checkout --theirs <file> && git add <file>
```

#### 3b. Migrations

Do not auto-resolve. Show both sides and ask. State operation-specific
ours/theirs semantics, especially during rebase.

#### 3c. Submodules

Halt. Show both pinned SHAs and ask which commit the submodule should point to.

#### 3d. Binary files

Halt. Show file type/size and ask whether to keep ours or theirs.

#### 3e. Generated files

Resolve the source spec first, then regenerate. If the source spec cannot be
identified or both specs changed incompatibly, halt.

#### 3f. Snapshots

Use the side that matches the intended code state, then regenerate snapshots.
During rebase, explicitly state that "ours" is upstream and "theirs" is the
replayed commit before choosing.

#### 3g. Notebooks

If conflict is output-only (`outputs` or `execution_count`), strip outputs.
If source cells conflict, treat as `other` and run intent inference.

#### 3h. mergiraf files

```bash
timeout 30 mergiraf solve -- <file> --compact --keep-backup=false
```

Exit code 124 means timeout; fall through to `other`. If markers remain after
mergiraf, fall through to `other`. Otherwise stage the file.

#### 3i. Other files

Before per-file resolution, route deterministically (advisory; the prose steps
below are unchanged):

```bash
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/meta-route.sh --unmerged-only --json
```

Record each file's `route`, `reason`, and `confidence` into the per-file
Decision Record. The router augments and audits judgment; it does not replace
it. See `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/meta-resolver.md`.

For each file:

1. Measure balance. If one side is more than 3x longer, LLM analysis is more
   appropriate. If balanced, prefer line-combination reasoning and lower
   confidence. If total conflict content is over 300 lines, halt and recommend
   decomposition: run `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/suggest-pr-split.sh --conflicts --scope both`
   to propose split groups, and fall back to `git-imerge` (see
   `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/recurring-conflicts.md`) when the change cannot
   be split (all groups low-confidence/cross-cutting).
1a. If balanced (with a diff3 base) and ≤ 400 lines, enumerate line-combination
    candidates:

    ```bash
    ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/sbse-recombine.sh --file <file> --top 3 --json
    ```

    Advisory: a `clear-winner` verdict (top ≥ 95, gap ≥ 10) supports the
    `additive` / `trivial` classification at step 9. An `ambiguous` verdict
    (top three within 5) is itself a HALT signal — pick by intent, not by
    score. `deferred` means the block exceeds the SBSE bound (>400 lines or
    >3x imbalance); fall through to the LLM path. See H-02 / I-27.
2. If one side is empty, classify as `modify-delete` and inspect commit order
   with `git log --oneline --left-right --merge -- <file>`.
3. Run stacked-PR detection:

   ```bash
   ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/detect-stacked-pr.sh --file <file> --json
   ```

4. Collect evidence before inferring intent:

   ```bash
   git log --oneline --left-right --merge -- <file>
   git show <sha> -- <file>
   git diff "$(git merge-base HEAD MERGE_HEAD)" HEAD -- <file>
   git diff "$(git merge-base HEAD MERGE_HEAD)" MERGE_HEAD -- <file>
   ```

4a. Build a hard-capped cross-file context bundle:

    ```bash
    ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/prompt-context.sh --file <file> --k 4
    ```

    Use the bundle (not freeform `git grep`) as the LLM context for intent
    inference. The `k=4` / 48-hit / 12 KB budget is empirically motivated
    (H-03 Rover ablation); deeper context degrades accuracy. See I-28.
5. For human-authored source/config conflicts, retrieve similar historical
   resolutions when the conflict is semantic, structural, competing, or intent is
   not obvious. Do not run this for generated files, lockfiles, snapshots,
   migrations, notebooks, binaries, submodules, or vendored output.

   ```bash
   ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/historical-resolution-search.sh \
     --file <file> --top 3 --json
   ```

   Treat matches as advisory evidence only:
   - similar past resolutions may clarify project intent or show that the
     repository usually recombines parent lines;
   - `no_signal` results are normal in squash/rebase-only or shallow histories;
   - never auto-apply a historical result.

   For C/C++ and other high-risk languages, require stronger intent evidence and
   validation even when similar historical examples exist.
6. Name the structural root cause.
7. Infer ours/theirs intent in one sentence each.
8. If either intent is unknown, HALT using the schema below.
9. Classify: trivial, additive, competing, structural, modify-delete, semantic.
10. Resolve, remove markers, stage, and produce a decision record.

### Step 4 — Validate

```bash
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/validate-and-reprompt.sh \
  --typecheck '<project-typecheck-cmd>' \
  --test '<focused-test-cmd>' \
  --max-iterations 1
```

Exit code 5 means the script wrote a reprompt artifact at
`.git/conflict-resolver/reprompt.md`. Read it, re-resolve the named files,
and re-invoke. The retry budget is bounded (default 1); on exhaustion the
script exits with the underlying error and you must HALT. The wrapper never
calls an LLM — Claude is the orchestrator (I-29).

Then run:

```bash
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/semantic-audit.sh
```

Any `SUSPECT` output requires review before continuing.

### Step 5 — Regenerate and continue

Regenerate lockfiles from manifests:

| Lockfile | Command |
|---|---|
| `package-lock.json` | `npm install` |
| `pnpm-lock.yaml` | `pnpm install` |
| `yarn.lock` | `yarn install` |
| `bun.lockb` / `bun.lock` | `bun install` |
| `npm-shrinkwrap.json` | `npm shrinkwrap` |
| `Cargo.lock` | `cargo generate-lockfile` |
| `poetry.lock` | `poetry lock --no-update` |
| `uv.lock` | `uv lock` |
| `pdm.lock` | `pdm lock` |
| `Gemfile.lock` | `bundle install` |
| `composer.lock` | `composer install` |
| `mix.lock` | `mix deps.get` |
| `Package.resolved` | `swift package resolve` |
| `pubspec.lock` | `dart pub get` / `flutter pub get` |
| `packages.lock.json` | `dotnet restore` |
| `flake.lock` | `nix flake lock` |

Continue:

| Context | Command |
|---|---|
| rebase | `git rebase --continue` |
| merge | `git commit --no-edit` |
| cherry-pick | `git cherry-pick --continue` |
| revert | `git revert --continue` |

Loop to Step 1 if more conflicts appear.

### Step 6 — Summarize

Produce Markdown plus fenced JSON:

```markdown
## Resolution Complete — <operation> on `<branch>`

| Category | Auto | User | Halted |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| lockfile | N | 0 | 0 |
| other | N | N | N |

**Lockfiles regenerated**: ...
**Semantic audit**: ...
**Constitutional overrides**: ...
**Decomposition recommended**: <none, or which groups were proposed>
```

```json
{
  "operation": "rebase",
  "branch": "feature",
  "categories": {},
  "semantic_audit": {"suspects": 0},
  "overrides": []
}
```

## Per-file Decision Record

```markdown
### Resolution: `<file-path>`

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Category | lockfile / migration / submodule / binary / generated / snapshot / notebook / mergiraf / other |
| Route (meta-router) | mechanical / stacked-auto / sbse-recombine / llm-imbalanced / llm-with-history / halt-decomposition / halt-other — reason |
| Evidence sources checked | commit-msg / ancestor-diff / related-files / PR-refs |
| Historical resolutions checked | none / no-signal:<reason> / <N examples: sha:path> |
| Intent (ours) | <sentence or UNKNOWN> |
| Intent (theirs) | <sentence or UNKNOWN> |
| Root cause | <structural cause> |
| Confidence | high / medium / low / none -> HALT |
| Conflict type | trivial / additive / competing / structural / modify-delete / semantic |
| Action | auto-resolved / user-directed / HALT / decompose-recommended |
| Behaviour after resolution | <sentence asserting post-merge behavior> |
```

```json
{
  "file": "<file-path>",
  "category": "other",
  "confidence": "high",
  "action": "auto-resolved",
  "conflict_type": "additive"
}
```

## HALT Schema

```markdown
## HALT — intent not inferable: `<file-path>`

**Context**: <operation> step <N/M> on `<branch>`

**Evidence checked**:
- Commit msg (ours): `<hash>` "<message>"
- Commit msg (theirs): `<hash>` "<message>"
- Ancestor diff (ours): <summary>
- Ancestor diff (theirs): <summary>

**Best read**:
- Ours appears to: <sentence>
- Theirs appears to: <sentence>

**Options**:
1. Take ours -> <outcome>
2. Take theirs -> <outcome>
3. Synthesize -> <proposal>
```

Abstention is better than a wrong merge.

## PR Decomposition (split mode)

Use when asked to decompose an oversized PR/branch, or when a large-conflict gate
routes here. Full guidance: `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/pr-decomposition.md`.

### Step S1 — Propose boundaries

```bash
# pre-conflict: analyze a PR/branch range
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/suggest-pr-split.sh --base <base-ref> --head <head-ref> --json
# in an oversized conflict
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/suggest-pr-split.sh --conflicts --scope both --json
```

Present the proposed groups in merge order (refactor-baseline first, then
schema/migration, then source, then ui/test). State each group's confidence.
Low-confidence (cross-cutting) groups are structural-only boundaries: flag them,
do not present them as safe. If every group is low-confidence, recommend keeping
the change whole or using `git-imerge` instead.

### Step S2 — Dry-run the stack

```bash
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/open-stacked-prs.sh --base <trunk-branch> --head <head-ref> \
  --group "<branch>:<path,path>" --group "<branch>:<path,path>"
```

`open-stacked-prs.sh` is dry-run by default and prints the `git`/`gh` plan. It
synthesizes new commits from path groups; it does not preserve original commit
topology unless the user explicitly supplied commit-aligned groups.

### Step S3 — Confirm, then execute

Creating branches and PRs is outward-facing. Show the dry-run plan and obtain
**explicit user confirmation** before re-running with `--execute --remote <name>`.
The script refuses dirty trees, protected/default branches, missing `gh` auth, and
pre-existing local/remote branch names unless the user explicitly changes the
plan. Each split must compile/typecheck on its own; verify before opening the next
PR. Retarget children to the trunk as parents merge (`gh pr edit <n> --base
<trunk>`).
