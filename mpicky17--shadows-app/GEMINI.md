---

## The Knights

Each Knight starts with 4 Life Points (max 6, dead at 0).

### Special Powers

| Knight | Title | Special Power | When Used |
|--------|-------|---------------|-----------|
| King Arthur | Son of Uther Pendragon | Once per turn, exchange 1 White card face-down with another Knight (regardless of location). Recipient must return 1 card. Both exchanges face-down, unknown to other players. | Heroic Action phase (before, after, or between actions) |
| Sir Galahad | Son of Lancelot | Once per turn, play 1 Special White card for free (must still take a different mandatory Heroic Action — cannot play a 2nd Special White as that mandatory action). | Heroic Action phase |
| Sir Gawain | Son of King Lot | When drawing White cards at the Round Table, draw 3 instead of 2. Still subject to 12-card hand limit. | During Round Table draw action |
| Sir Kay | Seneschal of King Arthur | When on a Quest where Combat ends, or when fighting a Siege Engine, may play 1 additional White Fight card after the Black cards/die have been revealed. | At combat quest resolution and siege engine fights |
| Sir Palamedes | Saracen Knight | For each victorious Quest he is on when it ends, gains 1 additional Life point (beyond quest victory spoils). Max 6 LP. | At quest victory |
| Sir Percival | Son of Pellinore | During Progression of Evil, may peek at the top Black card before deciding whether to draw it or select another Evil Action. | Progression of Evil phase |
| Sir Tristan | of Lyonesse | Departing from the Round Table is a free Move (doesn't cost his Heroic Action). Gets another Heroic Action to perform. | Heroic Action phase, when at Round Table |

### First Player
King Arthur goes first. If not in play, the youngest player starts. Play proceeds clockwise.

---

## Relics

Won from specific quests. Placed on the winning Knight's Coat of Arms.

| Relic | Source Quest | Effect | On Knight Death |
|-------|-------------|--------|-----------------|
| Excalibur | Quest for Excalibur | **Passive:** Add +1 to any Combat you participate in. **Active:** Discard Excalibur to counter any 1 Black Card just drawn. Cannot be gifted to another Knight. | Removed from game forever |
| Holy Grail | Quest for Holy Grail | Any dying Knight (reaching 0 LP) who drinks from the Grail gains 4 Life points. Discard after use. Owner can use on self. | N/A (consumed on use) |
| Lancelot's Armor | Quest for Lancelot | Anytime you must draw 1 Black card, draw 2 instead. Play 1, place the other back under the Black Draw pile. | Removed from game (but stays with Traitor if revealed) |

---

## Game Setup

1. Place Master gameboard in center. Place Excalibur, Holy Grail, Lancelot quest boards alongside.
2. Lancelot & Dragon quest starts with Lancelot's side face up.
3. Place relics on their quest boards. Place 12 Siege Engines, 4 Saxons, 4 Picts, 16 Swords in Reserve.
4. Each player gets a random Coat of Arms (Knight). Life die set to 4.
5. Place Knight miniatures at Round Table.
6. Shuffle Black cards into draw pile on board.
7. Give 1 Merlin card to each player. Shuffle remaining White cards. Deal 5 White cards to each player. Place remainder as White draw pile.
8. Shuffle 8 Loyalty cards. Deal 1 to each player (secret). Unused cards go in box unseen.
9. **Card sharing:** Each player places 1 White card face-up on Round Table. Discuss distribution. If no agreement, shuffle and redistribute randomly.

### 3-Player Variant
See "Three Brave Knights" in Advanced Rules — players don't peek at Loyalty cards until 6+ Swords on Round Table.

---

## Turn Structure

Each turn has two phases:

### Phase 1: Progression of Evil
Choose ONE of three actions (all help Evil):

#### a. Draw a Black Card
- Pick top Black card, read aloud, apply effect
- **Sir Percival** may peek first before deciding
- **Lancelot's Armor** holder draws 2, picks 1 to play, puts other back under the Black draw pile
- If Black Knight/Lancelot/Dragon combat card: may play face-down (hide value) and draw 1 free White card
- Standard Black: play on corresponding quest
- Special Black: apply immediately (can be cancelled by 3 Merlin cards collectively — must be immediate, never retroactive)
- If quest for a Black card is no longer in play: add 1 Siege Engine instead, discard the card

#### b. Add a Siege Engine
- Take from Reserve, place on empty Siege Engine spot around Camelot
- If 12th placed: game immediately lost

#### c. Lose 1 Life Point
- Turn Life die down by 1
- If reaches 0: die at end of turn (see Death rules)

**After Phase 1:** Check game-end conditions. If not triggered, proceed to Phase 2.

### Phase 2: Heroic Actions
Perform ONE Heroic Action (must take one — if unable to do quest action, must heal/accuse/play special white/move):

#### a. Move to a New Quest
- Move Knight to any destination (distance irrelevant, costs 1 Heroic Action)
- Exception: Moving between Camelot's Siege Area and Round Table is free
- Solo Quests (Black Knight, Lancelot): only 1 Knight at a time, must be unoccupied
- **Sir Tristan:** departing from Round Table is free (gets another Heroic Action)

#### b. Perform Quest-Specific Action
See Quest Details section below.

#### c. Play a Special White Card
- Read aloud, apply effect, discard
- Max 1 Special White card per turn
- **Sir Galahad:** may play this for free (still needs a different mandatory action)

#### d. Heal Yourself
- Discard 3 identical cards (e.g., 3 Grail cards or 3 Fight cards of same value)
- Gain 1 LP (max 6)

#### e. Accuse a Knight
- **Available only when:** 6+ Siege Engines around Camelot OR 6+ Swords on Round Table
- **Each Knight may accuse only once** in the entire game
- Don't need to be at same location as accused
- Target reveals Loyalty card:
  - If Loyal: flip 1 White Sword to Black (if any White Swords exist)
  - If Traitor: add 1 White Sword to Round Table. Traitor follows revealed Traitor rules.
- Traitor may falsely accuse to sow confusion

### Sacrifice (Extra Heroic Action)
- Once per turn, sacrifice 1 LP for a second **different** Heroic Action
- Cannot perform same action twice in same turn
- Can use Special Power before, after, or between the two actions
- If sacrifice brings you to 0 LP: perform the final action, then die (even if action would grant LP; only Holy Grail saves)

**After Phase 2:** Check game-end conditions. If not triggered, next player's turn.

- **Sacrifice death:** If sacrifice brings you to 0, complete the final action first, then die. Only Holy Grail can save you.
- **Do NOT reveal Loyalty** even when dead. Revealed only at game end.
- Dead Knights can still win posthumously if their side wins.

---

## The Traitor

### Hidden Traitor (Before Reveal)
- Plays normally like any other Knight
- Should act deceptively — subtle sabotage, not obvious evil moves
- May lie about intent or resources (but never cheat)
- May falsely accuse a Loyal Knight to flip a White Sword to Black
- Can voluntarily reveal at any time

### Revealed Traitor (After Accusation or Voluntary Reveal)
When revealed:
1. Accusing Knight adds 1 White Sword to Round Table (if accused, not voluntary)
2. Remove miniature from board (plays from the Shadows, out of reach)
3. Remove Life die (cannot be killed)
4. Discard all White cards
5. If holding Excalibur or Holy Grail: remove them from game
6. Lancelot's Armor stays with the Traitor

**Revealed Traitor's Turn:**
1. **Taunt the Knights:** Pick 1 White card at random from the hand of a Knight of your choice and discard it.
2. **Help Evil spread (choose 1):**
   - Add 1 Siege Engine to Camelot
   - OR Draw & play the top Black card

**Traitor Victory Conditions:**
- 12 Siege Engines surrounding Camelot
- 7+ Black Swords on the Round Table
- All other Knights dead
- 12+ Swords on Round Table and at least half are Black

### End-Game Traitor Reveal
If the Traitor is still alive and undetected when the 12th Sword is placed: Traitor reveals Loyalty card, and 2 White Swords are flipped to Black. Then count majority.

---

## Game End

The game ends **immediately** when:
1. 12 Siege Engines placed (instant loss for Loyal Knights)
2. 7+ Black Swords on Round Table (instant loss for Loyal Knights)
3. All Loyal Knights dead (instant loss for Loyal Knights)
4. 12th Sword placed on Round Table → hidden Traitor reveals (flips 2 white to black) → count majority:
   - Strictly more White than Black: Loyal Knights win
   - Otherwise: Evil/Traitor wins

Note: If several Swords are laid at once during the final action, the game may end with more than 12 Swords.

## Deck Reshuffling

When **either** draw pile (White or Black) runs out:
1. Reshuffle **both** discard piles into fresh draw piles
2. This happens even if the other pile hasn't been depleted yet
3. Both piles are reshuffled simultaneously

---

## Communication Rules

Players may discuss:
- Declarations of intent ("I'll fight the Saxons!")
- General resources ("My cards are strong")
- Capabilities ("That Black Knight looks weak")

Players may **NOT**:
- Reveal exact card values ("I have 3 Grails" or "I have a Fight 5")
- Propose specific trades ("Give me your Fight 3")

Players **MAY** lie about intent or resources (useful for the Traitor). But never cheat.

---

## Advanced and Optional Rules (Lowest Priority)

### Joining Mid-Game
New player draws remaining Coat of Arms + Loyalty card. Sits left of starting player. Life die to 4, draws 5 White cards, places miniature in Camelot.

### Expert Rules

#### The Squire's Challenge
Veteran players start as Squires (no Coat of Arms, no Special Power). Just Life die (4), 5 White cards, 1 Merlin. Earn Knighthood when present on a winning Quest. Then receive Coat of Arms + Special Power.

#### The Traitor Among Us
Take exactly N Loyal cards (N = player count), add Traitor card, shuffle, distribute. Dramatically increases Traitor probability.

#### Three Brave Knights (3 Players)
Don't peek at Loyalty cards until 6+ Swords on Round Table. Traitor should emphasize deception over brute force.
