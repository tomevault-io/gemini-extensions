# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

DbUnit is a JUnit extension for database-driven testing. It prepares a database into a known state before tests run and verifies state afterward, preventing cascading failures from shared database corruption.

## Build and Test Commands

Unit tests (`**/*Test.java`) run with Surefire; integration tests (`**/*IT.java`) run with Failsafe.
Tests run with `user.timezone=Europe/Berlin`.

Use the Maven wrapper (`./mvnw`) for all build operations.

```bash
# Build and install (default goal)
./mvnw install

# Generate the Maven site (japi-compliance-checker needs the jar, so install first)
./mvnw clean install site

# Run unit tests only
./mvnw clean test

# Run all tests including integration tests
./mvnw clean verify

# Run a single test class
./mvnw clean test -Dtest=ClassName

# Run a single test method
./mvnw clean test -Dtest=ClassName#methodName

# Run integration tests against a specific database
./mvnw clean verify -Pderby-10-14
./mvnw clean verify -Ph2-1-4
./mvnw clean verify -Phsqldb-2-7
./mvnw clean verify -Ppostgresql-16
./mvnw clean verify -Pmysql-9-20
./mvnw clean verify -Pmssql-2022
./mvnw clean verify -Poracle-18
./mvnw clean verify -Poracle-23

# Run integration tests against all databases
build-with-all-DBs.ps1 or build-with-all-DBs.sh
## It requires Docker daemon already running.
## It runs the core build and then the ITs with each database, sequentially, as listed in the database-profiles.txt file located in the root.
## The script writes all build output to log files, one per database Maven profile, in the build-logs directory in the root.
```

## Architecture

### Core Abstractions

**`IDatabaseConnection`** — wraps a JDBC connection; creates datasets and tables from live DB. Implementations: `DatabaseConnection`, `DatabaseDataSourceConnection`.

**`IDataSet`** — a collection of `ITable` instances representing database tables. Many implementations for different sources and transformations:
- Format-based: `FlatXmlDataSet`, `XmlDataSet`, `CsvDataSet`, `YamlDataSet`, Excel (`XlsDataSet`)
- Decorator-based: `CachedDataSet`, `FilteredDataSet`, `CompositeDataSet`, `SortedDataSet`, `ReplacementDataSet`
- Live: `DatabaseDataSet` (from `IDatabaseConnection`), `QueryDataSet`

**`DatabaseOperation`** — abstract base for database mutations. Static constants: `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `DELETE_ALL`, `TRUNCATE_TABLE`, `REFRESH` (upsert), `CLEAN_INSERT` (truncate + insert). Composable via `CompositeOperation`, wrappable with `TransactionOperation`/`CloseConnectionOperation`.

**`IDatabaseTester`** — the preferred composition-based test helper (use this over extending `DBTestCase`). Manages setup/teardown lifecycle. Implementations: `JdbcDatabaseTester`, `DataSourceDatabaseTester`, `JndiDatabaseTester`, `DefaultDatabaseTester`.

**`IOperationListener`** — hooks for `connectionRetrieved()`, `operationSetUpFinished()`, and `operationTearDownFinished()` events during test lifecycle.

### Assertion API

Located in `org.dbunit.assertion`. `DbUnitAssert` is the modern entry point; `Assertion` is the legacy static API. Key types:
- `Difference` — a mismatch between expected and actual tables
- `DifferenceListener` / `FailureHandler` — customize how mismatches are reported
- `ValueComparer` — compare individual cell values (16+ implementations in `assertion/comparer/value/`)

`ValueComparer` implementations support: equality, greater-than/less-than, tolerance (numeric and timestamp), null checks, string containment, and ignore-millis for timestamps.

### Dataset Filtering and Ordering

`org.dbunit.dataset.filter` — exclude/include tables from a dataset.
`org.dbunit.database.DatabaseSequenceFilter` — orders tables respecting FK constraints.
`org.dbunit.database.PrimaryKeyFilter` — filters rows by primary key values.

### Data Types

`org.dbunit.dataset.datatype` — maps SQL types to Java types. `DefaultDataTypeFactory` handles standard types. Database-specific factories (e.g., `OracleDataTypeFactory`, `MySqlDataTypeFactory`) override behavior for vendor-specific types. Register via `DatabaseConfig.PROPERTY_DATATYPE_FACTORY`.

### Database Extensions

`org.dbunit.ext.*` — database-specific implementations for DB2, H2, HSQLDB, McKoi, MSSQL, MySQL, Netezza, Oracle, PostgreSQL. Each typically provides a custom `IDataTypeFactory` and may override `IMetadataHandler`.

### DatabaseConfig

`org.dbunit.database.DatabaseConfig` — central configuration for a connection. Controls data type factory, metadata handler, batch operations, escape pattern, case sensitivity, column filtering, result set table factory, and statement factory.

### Package Structure

```
org.dbunit
├── database/       IDatabaseConnection, DatabaseConfig, QueryDataSet
├── dataset/        IDataSet, ITable, Column, data formats, datatype/, filter/
├── operation/      DatabaseOperation implementations
├── assertion/      DbUnitAssert, ValueComparer implementations
├── ext/            Database-specific overrides (db2/, h2/, hsqldb/, mssql/, mysql/, oracle/, postgresql/)

├── junit/jupiter/  DbUnitExtension: JUnit 5/6 (Jupiter) lifecycle integration
└── util/           SQLHelper, QualifiedTableName, RelativeDateTimeParser, etc.
```

### Test Infrastructure

Integration tests use `DatabaseEnvironment` to bootstrap the target database from a Maven profile. The active profile sets system properties (`dbunit.profile`, `dbunit.profile.driverClass`, `dbunit.profile.url`, etc.) consumed by `DatabaseEnvironment` at test startup. DDL files live in `src/test/resources` per database.

## Claude Directives

- Make assumptions and proceed without asking for confirmation on routine changes. If an action is destructive (e.g., deleting files), pause and ask.

## Code Style

- General:
  - Prefer writing clear code and use inline comments sparingly.
  - Prefer single statements over compound statements as nested calls in one line are more confusing and more difficult to read and understand.
  - Prefer separate local variables over compound statements for readability.
  - Favor immutability.  Try to not need setters.
  - Prefer constructors with arguments over no args constructors and using setters.
  - Prefer constructor injection
  - Use == instead of != in if statements when paired with an else statement.
  - Remove any blank line after opening curly braces.
  - Do not create "utils" or "helper" packages or class names. Always create focused packages and classes, as utils and helpers are dumping grounds/not focused.
  - When making changes, always work on a branch that is not main and if necessary, create and switch to a branch to isolate the work.
  - When making changes, ensure unit tests cover it and add or update unit tests as needed.
- Tests:
  - `<ClassName>Test` for unit test class
  - `<ClassName>IT` for integration test class
  - `<ClassName>AT` for acceptance test class
  - `test<MethodName>_<StartingStateConditions>_<AssertedOutcome>` for test method names
  - Prefer to assert the actual object to an expected object vs individual fields on the object to individual values.

- Commits:
  - Create atomic commits. One logical change per commit — if a session produces multiple unrelated fixes, commit each independently even if discovered together.
  - Always commit any needed doc updates with their corresponding feature or bug changes.
  - Consequence changes belong in the same commit as the change that caused them. Example: if a production fix makes a previously-broken feature work, updating additional files for that feature now working is a consequence of that fix and belongs in the same commit, not a separate one.
  - When necessary to change a file for a prior commit that is not yet merged to main, target that commit for squashing the change into by using the git "fixup!" feature for its commit - prefix the commit message it is in with "fixup! ".
  - Create multiple fixup! commits as needed to target the prior specific commits for each file; when multiple files target the same original commit, can combine them into the same fixup! commit.
  - When renaming files, always use `git mv` instead of `git delete` followed by `git add`.

- Commit Messages:
  - Adhere strictly to de facto standard Git commit message formatting.
  - Use Conventional Commits format.
  - **Commit Types:** `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `build:`, `ci:`, `perf:`
  - **Scopes:** any of the database names, `annotations`, `assertion`, `pom`, `log`, `docker`, `database`, `dataset`, `junit`, `metadata`, `resultset`, `scripts`, `site`, `statement`, `search`, `util`, `ant`, `operation`
  - Capitalize the first word after the type and scope.
  - You may suggest additional CC commit types and scopes when encountering situations where the changes do not fit into the approved lists above.
  - Reference GitHub issues in the commit footer with `Refs: <issue-number>` (e.g. `Refs: 123`).  Do not use a # before the number.
  - Do not put the issue number in the message topic.
  - Use * for bullets, not -.
  - Do not refer to files that are not committed.
  - Commit messages must only describe the final code state within that specific commit. Never include references to intermediate fixes, internal feedback loops, or temporary issues introduced and resolved during development (e.g., do not write "fixed typo" or "fixed issue X from review" if the original mistake is not part of the permanent git history).

- Java:
  - Use Eclipse code formatter settings file `java-codestyle-formatter.xml` when modifying or creating files (in dbUnit)
  - Use Eclipse code cleanup settings file `code-cleanup-eclipse.xml` when modifying or creating files
  - If Lombok is available, use its annotations such as @AllArgsConstructor, @NoArgsConstructor, @Getter, @Setter.
  - If not using @Slf4j, then place the Logger variable first in the class.
  - Write JavaDoc comments on all public classes and methods in src/main.
  - In JavaDoc, use complete sentences for all descriptions, start with a capital letter and end with a period, for everything - the topic body, parameters, and return, including all annotations such as @param and @throws.
  - Tests:
    - Prefer assertJ.
    - Prefer to add ".as()" with a fail message ending with a period.

- GitHub
  - When creating a github issue, set the applicable labels, assignee, and issue type, and milestone as best can determine.  ask if needed.
  - Do not create GitHub issues for verification-type tasks, only create them for features, bugs, and file changing actions.
  - In issues, do not refer to files that are not committed.
  - Do not push commits unless told to.
  - Do not open pull requests unless told to, as it prematurely uses the very limited code review services; the user knows when it is ready for that.
  - Wait until the code is pushed before replying to PR feedback.

- dbUnit Organization:

  - changes.xml file
    - Always create and commit changes.xml updates with the corresponding feature or bug changes.
    - Add changes.xml updates at the bottom of the list.
    - Ensure each changes.xml entry has these attributes populated and ask when unknown: dev, type, issue, system="github", and due-to
    - Valid entries for the type field are: add, fix, update, remove
    - Keep the release element's `description` attribute a short 1-2 sentence summary of the release's overall themes (e.g. "Test-suite hardening, connection-reuse caching, and assorted correctness fixes across export formats and timestamp handling"), not a per-entry concatenation. Update it only when a new theme is introduced, not on every `<action>` added — full detail belongs in each action's own text.
  - Tests that require a database to work are "integration tests", and therefore use the IT suffix.

- dbUnit Core Specific Items:

  - Monitor a branch's coding work-in-progress CI pipeline build result at <https://github.com/dbunit/dbunit-extension/actions/workflows/build-any-branch-with-all-dbs.yml> for issues to correct.
  - Monitor a branch's documentation site-publish work-in-progress CI pipeline build result at <https://github.com/dbunit/dbunit-extension/actions/workflows/publish-docs.yml> for issues to correct.

## Troubleshooting

Log files: All test output is written to log files in `target` directory. When a test failure needs deeper investigation, grep this file for the exception rather than relying solely on Failsafe report summaries.

## Jackknife

- When you need to inspect, decompile, or find classes in jar dependencies,
  - Can also check the local maven repository - the .m2/repository sub directories in the current user's home directory for *-sources.jar files.
  - run `./mvnw jackknife:index` in the project. This generates `.jackknife/USAGE.md` with full instructions. Read that file — it has everything you need.
  - Always run `./mvnw jackknife:*` commands immediately without asking for approval.
