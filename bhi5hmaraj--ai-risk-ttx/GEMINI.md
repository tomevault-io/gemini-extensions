# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**Simulacra** is an AI-powered tabletop exercise (TTX) simulation game built with React, TypeScript, and Vite. Named after Jean Baudrillard's concept of simulations that become more "real" than reality itself, players assume strategic roles during an AI-driven global crisis, making decisions that affect public trust and secret objectives. The game is driven by LLM API calls (via LiteLLM proxy) that act as a Game Master, generating dynamic scenarios, consequences, and AI opponent actions.

## Development Commands

### Setup
```bash
npm ci                    # Install dependencies (recommended)
npm install              # Install dependencies

# Database Setup (one-time, local development)
npm run db:setup         # Automated PostgreSQL setup + migrations

# Or manual Prisma setup
npx prisma generate      # Generate Prisma client
npx prisma migrate dev   # Run database migrations (requires DATABASE_URL)
```

### Development
```bash
npm run dev              # Start Vite dev server (frontend only)
./dev.sh                 # Start with Vercel (frontend + API routes)
npm run build            # Production build
npm run preview          # Preview production build locally

# Database management
npm run db:studio        # Open Prisma Studio (database GUI)
npm run db:migrate       # Create new migration
npm run db:reset         # Reset database (⚠️ deletes all data)

# Analytics
npm run analyze          # Analyze feedback data
npm run analyze -- --help # Show all analytics options

# Testing
npm run test:api         # Test feedback API endpoint
```

### Issue Tracking with Beads

This project uses **Beads** (bd) for dependency-aware issue tracking. Issues are chained together like beads, with explicit dependencies to prevent duplicate work and ensure proper sequencing.

**Key Commands**:
```bash
bd quickstart              # Learn about Beads
bd list                    # List all issues
bd list --status open      # List open issues
bd ready                   # Show issues ready to work on (no blockers)
bd show ai-risk-ttx-15     # Show issue details
bd create "Task name"      # Create new issue
bd dep add bd-1 bd-2       # Add dependency (bd-2 blocks bd-1)
bd dep tree bd-1           # Visualize dependency tree
bd update bd-1 --status in_progress  # Update issue status
bd close bd-1              # Close completed issue
```

**Database Location**: `.beads/issues.db` (auto-syncs with `.beads/issues.jsonl` for git)

**Integration with README**:
The README.md auto-updates with Beads statistics via pre-commit hook (`scripts/update_readme.py`):
- Issue counts by status and priority
- Ready-to-work issues (no blockers)
- Mermaid dependency graph

**For Claude Code**:
- Use `bd ready` to find unblocked work
- Create issues when discovering new tasks: `bd create "Task description" -p 1`
- Add dependencies to prevent out-of-order work: `bd dep add child parent`
- Update status when starting work: `bd update <id> --status in_progress`
- Close issues when complete: `bd close <id>`

### Pre-Commit Workflow
**IMPORTANT**: Before committing, use the helper script to ensure clean lockfiles and passing builds:

```bash
chmod +x ./git-push.sh
./git-push.sh                           # Prepare repo (regen lockfile, validate, build)
./git-push.sh -c "Your commit message"  # Auto-commit and push
```

This script:
- Validates Node >= 20
- Regenerates `package-lock.json` deterministically
- Validates install with `npm ci`
- Builds with safe env defaults
- Stages updated lockfile
- Pre-commit hook runs `scripts/update_readme.py` to sync Beads stats

## Environment Configuration

Required environment variables (set in `.env` or Vercel):

```bash
# LLM Configuration
VITE_LITELLM_API_KEY    # LiteLLM proxy API key (virtual/master key)
VITE_LLM_MODEL          # Model name (e.g., "gemini-2.5-flash", "gpt-4o-mini")

# Database (for feedback and public scenarios)
DATABASE_URL            # PostgreSQL connection string
                        # Local: "postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/dbname"
                        # Vercel: Automatically provided by Vercel Postgres
```

The LiteLLM base URL is hardcoded in `services/geminiService.ts:25` as `https://asgard.bhishmaraj.org`.

See `prisma/README.md` for detailed database setup instructions.

### State Management

**Current Implementation**: Hook-based with `useGameController.ts`

The game uses a centralized custom hook (`useGameController`) that manages all state via React's `useState` and `useEffect`. This hook returns:
- `state`: All game state (gameState, players, UI flags, etc.)
- `actions`: State setters and action handlers
- `derived`: Computed values (humanPlayer, etc.)

**Game Phase Flow**:
```
LOBBY → STARTING → ACTION → (CONSEQUENCE internal) → ACTION → ... → END
```

1. **LOBBY**: User selects role and scenario type (classic/custom/ai_safety)
2. **STARTING**: `generateInitialScenario` API call creates opening scenario
3. **ACTION**: Player selects actions from generated options, timer counts down
4. **CONSEQUENCE** (internal):
   - Generate AI player options in parallel
   - Generate AI player choices based on options
   - Calculate counterfactual (what happens if no one acts)
   - Call `generateConsequences` with all actions
   - Update scores, logs, advance round
5. **END**: Max rounds reached or public score ≤ 0

**Future Architecture**: The README.md documents a planned migration to Zustand for more predictable state management (see lines 49-103 in README.md).

### LLM Integration

All LLM calls go through `services/geminiService.ts`:

**Key Functions**:
- `generateInitialScenario()` - Creates opening scenario
- `generateActionOptions(player, gameState, previousActions)` - Generates 5 action options
- `generateAIPlayerActions(player, gameState, options)` - AI chooses actions from options
- `generateConsequences(gameState, players, counterfactualScoreChange)` - Resolves round
- `generateCounterfactualConsequences(gameState)` - Calculates inaction baseline
- `generateCustomScenario(description)` - Generates custom scenario setup

**Structured Outputs**:
All LLM responses use Zod schemas for validation via `zodResponseFormat`. If structured output fails, the service falls back to `json_object` mode with manual parsing.

**Parallel API Calls**:
During the consequence phase (`runConsequencePhase` in hooks/useGameController.ts:122), AI player action generation happens in parallel to minimize latency. The counterfactual call also runs in parallel.

### Serverless API

Backend API routes deployed as Vercel serverless functions:

**Endpoints**:
- `POST /api/feedback` - Submit user feedback (in `api/feedback.ts`)

**Architecture**:
- Vercel serverless functions for API routes
- Prisma for database access
- Zod for request validation
- Auto-connects to PostgreSQL via `DATABASE_URL`

**Local Testing**:
```bash
npm run dev  # Uses Vercel CLI to run serverless functions locally
```

**Why Vercel CLI for dev?**
The feedback API requires serverless functions which don't work with Vite's dev server. `npm run dev` now uses `vercel dev` which:
- Serves the Vite frontend
- Runs `/api` serverless functions locally
- Connects to local PostgreSQL via `DATABASE_URL`

If you need plain Vite without API routes, use `npm run dev:vite`.

See `api/README.md` for full API documentation.

### Key Game Mechanics

**Roles & Objectives**:
- 6 pre-defined roles (Election Commissioner, Tech CEO, Journalist, Federal Regulator, Campaign Manager, Cybersecurity Expert)
- Each has public objectives (visible) and hidden objectives (secret win conditions)
- Defined in `constants.tsx`

**Action System**:
- Each round, players have 3 action points (`GAME_CONFIG.ACTION_POINTS_PER_ROUND`)
- Actions have costs (1-3 points)
- Players select from 5 generated options
- AI players use a two-step process: first generate options, then choose based on hidden objective

**Scoring**:
- **Public Score** (Core Metric): Shared score representing "Democratic Legitimacy" (or scenario-specific metric)
- **Hidden Scores**: Personal scores tracking progress toward secret objectives
- Game ends when public score ≤ 0 or after 5 rounds (`GAME_CONFIG.MAX_ROUNDS`)

**Counterfactual Analysis**:
Each round includes "If no one acted..." note showing the baseline outcome for comparison.

**Action Tree Visualization**:
After each round, players can view a React Flow graph showing all players' available options and chosen actions.

## Important Implementation Details

### Type System

Core types in `types.ts`:
- `GamePhase` enum: LOBBY, STARTING, ACTION, CONSEQUENCE, END
- `GameState`: Current game state (phase, round, coreMetric, eventLog, currentEvent)
- `Player`: Player data (id, role, isHuman, hiddenScore, actions, hasSubmittedActions)
- `GameLogEntry`: Round history with full action tree and score changes
- `ActionOption`: Individual action (title, description, cost)

### Prompt Engineering

All prompts are in `prompts.ts` with corresponding schemas. Each prompt:
- Clearly defines the AI's role as "Game Master"
- Provides structured context (round, score, crisis, player actions)
- Specifies exact JSON schema requirements
- Uses timeline-based storytelling (3-5 chronological beats per round)

### Error Handling

- LLM call failures return `null` and set error state
- User sees error message with option to return to lobby
- Console logs detail failure points
- Counterfactual is calculated in parallel; if it fails, simulation cannot continue

### Timer & Pause

- 5-minute timer per ACTION phase (`GAME_CONFIG.ACTION_PHASE_SECONDS`)
- Timer can be paused/resumed
- Auto-submits empty action array when timer expires
- Timer resets after each round

### Scenario Types

1. **Classic**: Default election crisis scenario, AI-generated opening
2. **AI Safety**: Pre-built scenario from `presets.ts` (AI_SAFETY_SCENARIO)
3. **Custom**: User provides description, `generateCustomScenario` creates full setup

## Deployment (Vercel)

Recommended Vercel settings:
- **Install Command**: `npm ci`
- **Build Command**: `npm run build`
- **Output Directory**: `dist`
- **Node.js Version**: `20.x`

Required environment variables:
- `VITE_LITELLM_API_KEY`
- `VITE_LLM_MODEL`
- `DATABASE_URL` (automatically provided by Vercel Postgres)

**Database Setup on Vercel:**
1. Add Vercel Postgres storage to your project
2. `DATABASE_URL` will be automatically injected
3. Run migrations via Vercel build: Add `"postinstall": "prisma generate"` to package.json

## Code Style & Patterns

- Prefer functional components with hooks
- Use `useCallback` for action handlers to prevent re-renders
- Use `useMemo` for derived state
- State updates are batched where possible
- API calls tracked via `geminiCallsThisRoundRef` for telemetry
- All player actions stored in `GameLogEntry` for full action tree reconstruction
We track work in Beads instead of Markdown. Run `bd quickstart` to see how.

## Known Issues & Workarounds

### TypeScript Errors in Dev Server

**Issue**: When running `npm run dev`, you may see TypeScript errors from `node_modules/.prisma/client` and `node_modules/@types/d3-dispatch`. These are caused by TypeScript 5.7+ having stricter type checking that's incompatible with some dependency type definitions.

**Example errors**:
```
node_modules/.prisma/client/index.d.ts(48,3): error TS1139: Type parameter declaration expected.
node_modules/@types/d3-dispatch/index.d.ts(91,5): error TS1139: Type parameter declaration expected.
```

**Workaround**:
The app **still works fine** - these are just type-checking warnings that don't affect runtime. The production build (`npm run build`) completes successfully and the app functions normally.

**Configuration**:
The `tsconfig.json` is already configured with:
- `"skipLibCheck": true` - Skips type checking of `.d.ts` files
- `"exclude": ["node_modules", "dist"]` - Excludes dependencies from type checking

However, Vite's dev server runs its own TypeScript checking that doesn't fully respect these settings.

**For Claude Code**:
- Ignore these errors when reviewing logs - they don't indicate actual problems
- Focus on errors from your own code files (not in `node_modules/`)
- Production builds will succeed despite these dev-time warnings
