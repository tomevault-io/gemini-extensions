# Development Rules

## Commands
- After code changes (not documentation changes): `pnpm check` (get full output, no tail). Fix all errors, warnings, and infos before committing.
- Note: `pnpm check` does not run tests.
- NEVER run: `pnpm dev`, `pnpm build`, `pnpm test`
- Only run specific tests if user instructs: `pnpx tsx ../../node_modules/vitest/dist/cli.js --run test/specific.test.ts`
- If you create or modify a test file, you MUST run that test file and iterate until it passes.
- When writing tests, run them, identify issues in either the test or implementation, and iterate until fixed.
- NEVER commit unless user asks

## Style
- Keep answers short and concise
- No emojis in commits, issues, PR comments, or code
- No fluff or cheerful filler text
- Technical prose only, be kind but direct (e.g., "Thanks @user" not "Thanks so much @user!")

## Changelog
Location: `CHANGELOG.md`

### Format
Use these sections under `## [Unreleased]`:
- `### Breaking Changes` - API changes requiring migration
- `### Added` - New features
- `### Changed` - Changes to existing functionality
- `### Fixed` - Bug fixes
- `### Removed` - Removed features

### Rules
- Before adding entries, read the full `[Unreleased]` section to see which subsections already exist
- New entries ALWAYS go under `## [Unreleased]` section
- Append to existing subsections (e.g., `### Fixed`), do not create duplicates
- NEVER modify already-released version sections (e.g., `## [0.12.2]`)
- Each version section is immutable once released

### Attribution
- **Internal changes (from issues)**: `Fixed foo bar ([#123](https://github.com/aamdmn/payload-agent/issues/123))`
- **External contributions**: `Added feature X ([#456](https://github.com/aamdmn/payload-agent/pull/456) by [@username](https://github.com/username))`

## Release

Publish, git tag, and GitHub release are a single command so they cannot drift apart (0.9.0 and 0.10.0 reached npm but were never tagged/released because this step was manual).

1. In the feature PR: bump `version` in `package.json` and move the `[Unreleased]` entries into a new `## [x.y.z] - YYYY-MM-DD` CHANGELOG section.
2. Merge to `main`, then from a clean, up-to-date `main` run:
   - `pnpm release` — releases the current `package.json` version
   - `pnpm release "short summary"` — same, with a custom GitHub release title (default title is `vx.y.z`)
   - `pnpm release --dry-run` — runs every check and prints the plan, changes nothing

`scripts/release.mjs` runs all read-only checks first (on `main`, clean tree, in sync with origin, tag does not already exist, version not already on npm, `gh` installed + authed), then `pnpm publish` (pnpm-only — see `ensure-pnpm.mjs`), then creates and pushes the annotated tag, then the GitHub release. Release notes are pulled from the matching `CHANGELOG.md` section, so the changelog is the single source of truth — do not hand-write release notes.

## **CRITICAL** Tool Usage Rules **CRITICAL**
- NEVER use sed/cat to read a file or a range of a file. Always use the read tool (use offset + limit for ranged reads).
- You MUST read every file you modify in full before editing.

## **CRITICAL** Git Rules for Parallel Agents **CRITICAL**

Multiple agents may work on different files in the same worktree simultaneously. You MUST follow these rules:

### Committing
- **ONLY commit files YOU changed in THIS session**
- ALWAYS include `fixes #<number>` or `closes #<number>` in the commit message when there is a related issue or PR
- NEVER use `git add -A` or `git add .` - these sweep up changes from other agents
- ALWAYS use `git add <specific-file-paths>` listing only files you modified
- Before committing, run `git status` and verify you are only staging YOUR files
- Track which files you created/modified/deleted during the session

### Forbidden Git Operations
These commands can destroy other agents' work:
- `git reset --hard` - destroys uncommitted changes
- `git checkout .` - destroys uncommitted changes
- `git clean -fd` - deletes untracked files
- `git stash` - stashes ALL changes including other agents' work
- `git add -A` / `git add .` - stages other agents' uncommitted work
- `git commit --no-verify` - bypasses required checks and is never allowed

### Safe Workflow
```bash
# 1. Check status first
git status

# 2. Add ONLY your specific files
git add packages/ai/src/providers/transform-messages.ts
git add packages/ai/CHANGELOG.md

# 3. Commit
git commit -m "fix(ai): description"

# 4. Push (pull --rebase if needed, but NEVER reset/checkout)
git pull --rebase && git push
```

### If Rebase Conflicts Occur
- Resolve conflicts in YOUR files only
- If conflict is in a file you didn't modify, abort and ask the user
- NEVER force push

### User override
If the user instructions conflict with rules set out here, ask for confirmation that they want to override the rules. Only then execute their instructions.


# Payload Plugin Development

This project is a **Payload CMS plugin** (`payload-agent`). All source code lives in `src/`, with a `dev/` directory for local testing.

For Payload CMS fundamentals (collections, fields, hooks, access control, queries, security patterns), refer to the installed `payload` skill and its reference files in `.agents/skills/payload/`.

## Project Structure

```
src/                          # Plugin source code
  index.ts                    # Entry point: plugin function + types
dev/                          # Local dev environment (NOT plugin code)
  payload.config.ts           # Test Payload config that uses the plugin
  seed.ts                     # Seed data for dev/testing
  int.spec.ts                 # Integration tests
  e2e.spec.ts                 # End-to-end tests
```

## Plugin Architecture Rules

- **Plugin signature**: `(options) => (config: Config) => Config` (curried function)
- **Always spread existing config**: Never overwrite arrays/objects, always spread first
  ```ts
  // Correct
  config.endpoints = [...(config.endpoints ?? []), myEndpoint]
  // Wrong - destroys user's existing endpoints
  config.endpoints = [myEndpoint]
  ```
- **Preserve existing onInit**: Save `config.onInit` reference, call it before plugin init
- **Preserve existing hooks**: Spread `collection.hooks?.hookName || []` when adding hooks
- **Provide `disabled` option**: Let users disable the plugin without uninstalling it
- **Never store plugin logic in `dev/`**: That directory is purely for testing

## Security Rules (Payload-Specific)

- **Local API**: Always set `overrideAccess: false` when passing `user` to payload operations
- **Transaction safety**: Always pass `req` to nested operations inside hooks
- **Hook loops**: Use `context` flags to prevent infinite recursion
- See `.agents/skills/payload/reference/PLUGIN-DEVELOPMENT.md` for full patterns

## Plugin Testing

- Integration tests live in `dev/int.spec.ts`
- E2E tests live in `dev/e2e.spec.ts`
- The dev project uses SQLite (`@payloadcms/db-sqlite`) for easy local testing
- Run tests with the commands in the Commands section above

# Ultracite Code Standards

This project uses **Ultracite**, a zero-config preset that enforces strict code quality standards through automated formatting and linting.

## Quick Reference

- **Format code**: `pnpm dlx ultracite fix`
- **Check for issues**: `pnpm dlx ultracite check`
- **Diagnose setup**: `pnpm dlx ultracite doctor`

Biome (the underlying engine) provides robust linting and formatting. Most issues are automatically fixable.

---

## Core Principles

Write code that is **accessible, performant, type-safe, and maintainable**. Focus on clarity and explicit intent over brevity.

### Type Safety & Explicitness

- Use explicit types for function parameters and return values when they enhance clarity
- Prefer `unknown` over `any` when the type is genuinely unknown
- Use const assertions (`as const`) for immutable values and literal types
- Leverage TypeScript's type narrowing instead of type assertions
- Use meaningful variable names instead of magic numbers - extract constants with descriptive names

### Modern JavaScript/TypeScript

- Use arrow functions for callbacks and short functions
- Prefer `for...of` loops over `.forEach()` and indexed `for` loops
- Use optional chaining (`?.`) and nullish coalescing (`??`) for safer property access
- Prefer template literals over string concatenation
- Use destructuring for object and array assignments
- Use `const` by default, `let` only when reassignment is needed, never `var`

### Async & Promises

- Always `await` promises in async functions - don't forget to use the return value
- Use `async/await` syntax instead of promise chains for better readability
- Handle errors appropriately in async code with try-catch blocks
- Don't use async functions as Promise executors

### React & JSX

- Use function components over class components
- Call hooks at the top level only, never conditionally
- Specify all dependencies in hook dependency arrays correctly
- Use the `key` prop for elements in iterables (prefer unique IDs over array indices)
- Nest children between opening and closing tags instead of passing as props
- Don't define components inside other components
- Use semantic HTML and ARIA attributes for accessibility:
  - Provide meaningful alt text for images
  - Use proper heading hierarchy
  - Add labels for form inputs
  - Include keyboard event handlers alongside mouse events
  - Use semantic elements (`<button>`, `<nav>`, etc.) instead of divs with roles

### Error Handling & Debugging

- Remove `console.log`, `debugger`, and `alert` statements from production code
- Throw `Error` objects with descriptive messages, not strings or other values
- Use `try-catch` blocks meaningfully - don't catch errors just to rethrow them
- Prefer early returns over nested conditionals for error cases

### Code Organization

- Keep functions focused and under reasonable cognitive complexity limits
- Extract complex conditions into well-named boolean variables
- Use early returns to reduce nesting
- Prefer simple conditionals over nested ternary operators
- Group related code together and separate concerns

### Security

- Add `rel="noopener"` when using `target="_blank"` on links
- Avoid `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` unless absolutely necessary
- Don't use `eval()` or assign directly to `document.cookie`
- Validate and sanitize user input

### Performance

- Avoid spread syntax in accumulators within loops
- Use top-level regex literals instead of creating them in loops
- Prefer specific imports over namespace imports
- Avoid barrel files (index files that re-export everything)
- Use proper image components (e.g., Next.js `<Image>`) over `<img>` tags

### Framework-Specific Guidance

**Next.js:**
- Use Next.js `<Image>` component for images
- Use `next/head` or App Router metadata API for head elements
- Use Server Components for async data fetching instead of async Client Components

**React 19+:**
- Use ref as a prop instead of `React.forwardRef`

**Solid/Svelte/Vue/Qwik:**
- Use `class` and `for` attributes (not `className` or `htmlFor`)

---

## Testing

- Write assertions inside `it()` or `test()` blocks
- Avoid done callbacks in async tests - use async/await instead
- Don't use `.only` or `.skip` in committed code
- Keep test suites reasonably flat - avoid excessive `describe` nesting

## When Biome Can't Help

Biome's linter will catch most issues automatically. Focus your attention on:

1. **Business logic correctness** - Biome can't validate your algorithms
2. **Meaningful naming** - Use descriptive names for functions, variables, and types
3. **Architecture decisions** - Component structure, data flow, and API design
4. **Edge cases** - Handle boundary conditions and error states
5. **User experience** - Accessibility, performance, and usability considerations
6. **Documentation** - Add comments for complex logic, but prefer self-documenting code

---

Most formatting and common issues are automatically fixed by Biome. Run `pnpm dlx ultracite fix` before committing to ensure compliance.
