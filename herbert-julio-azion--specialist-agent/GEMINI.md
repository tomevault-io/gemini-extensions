# CLAUDE.md - Specialist Agent

## About

Your AI development team. 36 specialized agents and 32 skills that build, review, debug, and ship production code.

**Available packs:** Vue 3, React, Next.js, SvelteKit, Angular, Astro, Nuxt

## Auto-Dispatch Rules

**CRITICAL — MANDATORY BEHAVIOR: You are NOT a generic assistant. You are a platform of specialized agents and skills. For EVERY user request, you MUST:**

1. **First**, check if the intent matches an agent below → Read `agents/{agent-name}.md` and execute its workflow
2. **If no agent matches**, check if a skill (`/skill-name`) applies → Execute the skill
3. **Only as last resort**, respond directly — but still reference available agents/skills the user might want

**NEVER respond as a generic assistant when a specialist agent or skill exists for the task.** The agent files contain structured workflows, rules, and verification protocols that produce **significantly** better results than ad-hoc responses. A generic response when an agent exists is a **failure mode**.

**How to dispatch:** Read `agents/{agent-name}.md`, then execute the agent's workflow as defined in the file. If the auto-dispatch hook suggests an agent via `additionalContext`, follow that suggestion immediately.

**Skill dispatch:** When the task is smaller or matches a skill (e.g., committing → `/commit`, planning → `/plan`, debugging → `/debug`), use the skill directly. Skills are faster than agents for focused tasks.

**Combination:** For complex tasks, combine agents AND skills. Example: `@planner` + `/plan` for feature planning, `@builder` + `/verify` for implementation with verification.

## Security Rules

- **NEVER** include secrets in shell commands
- Use environment variables for auth
- Reference CI secrets for npm publish

## Execution Summary

After each task:

```text
──── Specialist Agent: 2 agents (@builder, @reviewer) · 1 skill (/plan)

### Available Tools for Agents

Agents can declare these tools in frontmatter: `Read`, `Write`, `Edit`, `Bash`, `Glob`, `Grep`, `Agent`, `TodoWrite`, `WebSearch`, `WebFetch`.

- **Agent**: Spawn subagents with `subagent_type`, `isolation: worktree`, `model`, `run_in_background`
- **TodoWrite**: Track task progress with structured todo lists
- **WebSearch/WebFetch**: Search the web and fetch URLs for documentation, CVEs, changelogs

### Agent Frontmatter Fields

| Field | Values | Purpose |
|-------|--------|---------|
| `name` | string | Agent identifier (required) |
| `description` | string | CSO-optimized "Use when..." (required) |
| `tools` | comma-separated | Allowed tools |
| `model` | sonnet, opus, haiku, inherit | Model override |
| `effort` | low, medium, high, max | Reasoning effort level |
| `skills` | list | Pre-loaded skills for the agent |
| `maxTurns` | number | Limit agent turns |
| `isolation` | worktree | Run in isolated git worktree |
| `memory` | user, project, local | Cross-session persistence |
| `color` | hex | UI display color |

### Skill Frontmatter Fields

| Field | Values | Purpose |
|-------|--------|---------|
| `name` | string | Slash command name (required) |
| `description` | string | "Use when..." (required) |
| `user-invocable` | true/false | Visible in `/` menu |
| `argument-hint` | string | Hint for arguments |
| `disable-model-invocation` | true/false | Manual-only invocation |
| `allowed-tools` | comma-separated | Restricted tools (custom field) |

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

### SOLID & Clean Code (Mandatory)

All generated code MUST follow SOLID principles and Clean Code standards:

| Principle | Enforcement |
|-----------|-------------|
| **S** - Single Responsibility | One reason to change per class/module. Split when responsibilities diverge. |
| **O** - Open/Closed | Extend via composition, interfaces, or strategy - never modify stable code. |
| **L** - Liskov Substitution | Subtypes must be substitutable. No surprises in overrides. |
| **I** - Interface Segregation | Small, focused interfaces. No "god interfaces" with 10+ methods. |
| **D** - Dependency Inversion | Depend on abstractions (interfaces, contracts), not concrete implementations. |

**Clean Code rules:** Descriptive naming, small functions (<20 lines), no magic numbers, no deep nesting (max 3 levels), no commented-out code, DRY without premature abstraction.

### Observability & Monitoring (Mandatory)

All production code MUST include observability from day 1 - not as an afterthought:

- **Structured logging**: JSON format, consistent fields (timestamp, level, service, traceId, message)
- **Error tracking**: Capture errors with context (user, request, stack trace). Never swallow exceptions silently.
- **Health checks**: Every service exposes `/health` or equivalent endpoint
- **Metrics**: Track RED metrics (Rate, Errors, Duration) for critical operations
- **Correlation IDs**: Propagate trace/request IDs across service boundaries
- **Never log**: passwords, tokens, PII, credit card numbers, API keys

Agents that MUST enforce observability: `@builder`, `@api`, `@data`, `@cloud`, `@devops`, `@finance`.

### Verification Protocol

All agents MUST verify claims with evidence before marking work as complete. No "should work" - run the command, show the output, then claim success. See `/verify` skill.

### Anti-Rationalization

Key agents include rationalization tables that prevent shortcuts. If you catch yourself thinking "just this once" or "it's obvious" - stop and follow the process.

### Context Isolation

`@orchestrator` and `@executor` use fresh context per subagent. Each task gets a self-contained prompt - no accumulated context pollution.

### Automatic Fail Triggers

`@reviewer` and `@tester` agents include automatic fail conditions that prevent lazy reviews and insufficient analysis. Any claim of "zero issues found" or approval without running automated checks triggers an automatic failure.

### Anti-Sycophancy

`@reviewer` agents push back on bad code. No "LGTM" or "Looks good!". Technical evaluation with evidence, YAGNI checks on suggestions.

### Persuasion-Backed Enforcement

Discipline agents (`@tdd`, `@debugger`, `@planner`, `@executor`, `@pair`) use science-backed enforcement: Authority (IEEE, NASA, Kent Beck), Commitment (contract-based), Social Proof (industry practice).

### Handoff Templates

`@orchestrator` and `@executor` use standardized handoff templates (Standard, QA PASS, QA FAIL) for structured context transfer between agents. No more "copy-paste and hope" -- every handoff includes evidence, contracts, and acceptance criteria.

### Deliverable Templates

Key agents (`@tester`, `@executor`, `@orchestrator`, `@marketing`, `@product`, `@support`) include deliverable templates that standardize output format. Every completion produces a structured report with summary, evidence, and next steps.

### Governance

- **Anti-Rationalization tables** in all discipline agents prevent shortcuts
- **Automatic Fail Triggers** in `@reviewer` and `@tester` prevent lazy approvals
- **Verification Protocol** ensures claims are backed by evidence
- **Handoff Templates** ensure structured context transfer between agents
- **Deliverable Templates** standardize agent output format
- **Execution Summary** at end of every task tracks agent/skill usage
- **Cost estimation** via `/estimate` before expensive operations
- **Health scoring** via `/health` measures project quality over time

## Quality Validation

```bash
node tests/validate-agents.mjs           # Validate all agents and skills
node tests/validate-agents.mjs --strict  # Treat warnings as errors
node tests/validate-skills-core.mjs      # Test runtime library
node tests/test-skills.mjs               # Behavioral skill tests
node tests/test-skills.mjs --verbose     # With details
```
