# FTG Racing Manager — Claude Development Guide

## 1. Mandatory Pre-Development Review

Before modifying or creating any module, service, or feature, read the relevant documentation under:

```
frontend/src/routes/admin/docs/ai/
```

| Document | When to read |
|---|---|
| `standards.md` | Always — governs code patterns |
| `architecture.md` | Always — state machines, critical fallbacks |
| `services.md` | When touching services, stores, or Cloud Functions |
| `database_schema.md` | When touching Firestore reads/writes |
| `weekend_pipeline.md` | When touching race simulation or scheduled functions |
| `human/postmortem_r2.md` / `human/postmortem_r3.md` | When modifying `functions/index.js` |
| `human/postmortem_admin_qualy_wipe.md` | When creating or modifying any admin tool |

## 2. Technology Stack

This is a **Svelte 5 + Firebase** web application. The Flutter codebase (`lib/`) is **deprecated and must not be modified**. All new development happens in `frontend/`.

```
frontend/        ← SvelteKit 5 (active — all development here)
functions/       ← Firebase Cloud Functions v2 (Node.js 20, strict mode)
lib/             ← DEPRECATED Flutter code. Do not touch.
```

**Frontend stack:** SvelteKit · Svelte 5 Runes · TypeScript · Tailwind CSS · Firebase v10
**Backend:** Firestore · Cloud Functions v2 · Firebase Auth · Firebase Hosting

---

## 3. Core Development Rules

### 3.1 Reactivity (Svelte 5 Runes — Non-negotiable)

- **Use `$state()`** for reactive data from Firestore.
- **Use `$derived()`** for all computed values — formatting, filtering, transformations.
- **Use `$effect()`** sparingly — only for DOM integrations or Firebase SDK synchronization.
- **Never use** Svelte 4 `writable` / `readable` stores for local state.
- **Expose reactive state** via class getters, not raw store exports.

### 3.2 Architecture: Service / Store Separation

```
src/lib/services/*.svelte.ts  →  Stateless logic, pure Firebase API calls
src/lib/stores/*.svelte.ts    →  UI reactivity, Firestore onSnapshot listeners
src/routes/**/*.svelte        →  UI only — NO direct Firestore calls
```

**Hard rule:** Never call `doc()`, `getDoc()`, `setDoc()`, or `collection()` directly from a `.svelte` component file.

### 3.3 Transactional Safety

Every mutation that affects **budget**, driver/team **ownership**, or **economic fields** (`budget`, `value`, `salary`) **must** use `runTransaction` or a server-side Cloud Function.

Silent writes outside transactions are forbidden for these fields.

### 3.4 Error Handling

- Empty `catch` blocks are **forbidden**.
- All errors must be logged with namespace context:
  ```typescript
  console.error('[SponsorService:negotiate] Failed to write transaction:', e);
  ```
- Use `try/catch` at the boundary where recovery or user feedback is possible, not at every line.

### 3.5 UI/UX Standards

- **No browser dialogs.** `alert()`, `confirm()`, and `prompt()` are prohibited. Use `uiStore` and custom modal components.
- **Tailwind CSS only.** No inline styles, no raw hex codes. Custom colors reference variables defined in `app.css`.
- **Design tokens** — All surfaces and colors use CSS variables (`--app-primary`, `--app-surface`, `--app-bg`, etc.). Never reference design values by literal color.
- **Mobile First.** Design for mobile, then scale up to desktop dashboards.
- **Design aesthetic:** Premium Dark Gold — high contrast, subtle gradients, `backdrop-blur` for overlays.

### 3.6 Anti-Hardcoding

Every business value must be centralized:

- **Text:** Use the i18n utility (`src/lib/utils/i18n.ts`) for all user-facing strings.
- **Business constants:** Reference `reglas_negocio.md` and centralize in `src/lib/constants/`. Never embed fees, thresholds, or multipliers directly in logic.
  - Examples: Team rename fee ($500k), HQ maintenance (Level × $15k), XP threshold (500 XP), Fibonacci upgrade multipliers.
- **Firestore config:** Prefer Firestore-stored config for values that change over time.

## 4. Cloud Functions — Critical Safety Rules

> **Context:** Functions run in Node.js strict mode. Violations are silent — they fail in Firebase logs only, not in local console.

### 4.1 Variable Declaration (Postmortem R2/R3 — Critical)

**Always declare variables with `let` before any conditional assignment.**

```js
// WRONG — throws ReferenceError in strict mode
if (teamRole === "ex_driver") { extraCrash = 0.001; }
const crashed = Math.random() < (accProb + extraCrash);

// CORRECT
let extraCrash = 0;
if (teamRole === "ex_driver") { extraCrash = 0.001; }
const crashed = Math.random() < (accProb + extraCrash);
```

### 4.2 Array Guard Pattern (Postmortem R2/R3 — Critical)

**Always check `array.length > 0`, not just array existence. Empty arrays are truthy.**

```js
// WRONG — [] is truthy, causes false skip
if (rSnap.data().qualyGrid) { continue; }

// CORRECT
if (rSnap.data().qualyGrid?.length > 0) { continue; }
```

### 4.3 Deploy Verification Rule

After ANY fix to `functions/index.js`, remind the user to:
1. Run `firebase deploy --only functions`
2. Verify in Firebase Console → Functions that the deployment timestamp is current

A local-only fix is **not** a deployed fix. See `postmortem_r3.md` — R2's fix was applied locally but never deployed, causing an identical failure 5 days later.

### 4.4 Admin Tool Safety Rules (Postmortem admin_qualy_wipe — Critical)

**Every admin tool that iterates a collection must have an explicit scope guard and a `// SCOPE:` comment.**

```ts
// WRONG — touches ALL race documents including completed historical rounds
for (const rDoc of racesSnap.docs) {
    racesBatch.update(rDoc.ref, { qualyGrid: [] });
}

// CORRECT — scope guard protects completed documents
// SCOPE: Only unfinished races (isFinished !== true)
for (const rDoc of racesSnap.docs) {
    if (rDoc.data()?.isFinished === true) continue;
    racesBatch.update(rDoc.ref, { qualyGrid: [] });
}
```

**All admin tools that write to Firestore must support dry-run mode** and print a pre-flight summary of affected document IDs before executing any writes.

**Data durability rule:** Any field that feeds statistics, economic history, or classification records must be written to at least two places: the operational collection (mutable) and an immutable append-only collection. Example: `races/{id}.qualyGrid` (operational) + `qualifying_results/{id}` (immutable backup). See T-020.

### 4.5 Universe Sync (Manual Step)

The `/season/standings` page reads from `universe/game_universe_v1` (a denormalized aggregate). After any manual race simulation:

```bash
# Run from /functions directory
node sync_universe.js
```

This step is **not automatic**. Without it, standings remain stale.

## 5. Race Weekend State Machine

```
Monday 00:00 → Saturday 13:59  →  practice
Saturday 14:00                  →  qualifying
Saturday 15:00                  →  raceStrategy
Sunday 14:00                    →  race
Sunday 16:00                    →  postRace  (maps to "practice" in UI fallback)
```

**Critical fallback:** `weekStatus.globalStatus` does NOT exist in the backend. The `/racing` page derives status from `timeService.currentStatus`. When status is `POST_RACE`, the UI must map it to `"practice"` to render `GaragePanel` — not `RaceLivePanel` (empty).

**Timers:** Use `getTimeUntil(RaceWeekStatus.QUALIFYING)` for session countdowns — NOT `getTimeUntilNextEvent()`, which counts to the next state change and may return Monday 00:00.

---

## 6. Testing Policy

- **Playwright E2E tests are prohibited.** Do not create, suggest, or run Playwright tests. QA is performed manually by the team.
- **Vitest unit tests are required** for new deterministic logic (finance calculations, simulation math, service methods).
- **Test files live alongside their source:** `service.svelte.ts` → `service.test.ts`.
- **Async safety:** Gate all Firebase calls behind `browser` environment checks and/or `authStore.loading` checks to prevent SSR race conditions.

---

## 7. Documentation Maintenance

When you modify a business rule, data structure, service interface, or architectural pattern, update the corresponding markdown file:

| Change type | Update file |
|---|---|
| New/changed service or store | `ai/services.md` |
| New/changed data shape | `ai/database_schema.md` |
| New business rule or economic value | `human/reglas_negocio.md` |
| New/changed component pattern | `ai/components.md` |
| Simulation or Cloud Function logic | `ai/weekend_pipeline.md` |
| **Any version bump** | `README.md` — update the `**Version:**` line |

**JSDoc is mandatory** for all public methods in services and stores (parameters, return types, side effects).

---

## 8. Emergency Recovery Protocol

If any automated simulation fails, run from `functions/` in order:

```bash
node scripts/emergency/force_race_local.js qualy  # 1. Re-run qualifying
node scripts/emergency/force_race_local.js race    # 2. Re-run race  (or force_race_wrapper.js)
node scripts/emergency/force_post_race.js          # 3. Force economy processing
node scripts/emergency/sync_universe.js            # 4. Sync Standings UI
```

**Do not skip steps.** Each depends on the previous completing cleanly (Exit code 0).

> **Note:** `reset_all.js` and `run_simulation.js` do not exist. Use `force_race_local.js` or `force_race_wrapper.js` for manual race simulation.

---

## 9. Version Control Conventions

### 9.1 Branch Naming

Every branch must use one of these prefixes — never use `feature/` for work that isn't a new user-facing feature:

| Prefix | When to use |
|---|---|
| `feature/` | New user-facing module or functionality |
| `fix/` | Bug fix (any severity) |
| `chore/` | Tech debt, refactoring, docs, tooling, deps — no user-facing change |
| `hotfix/` | Urgent production fix branched directly from `main` |

**Format:** `<type>/<version>-<short-description>` when tied to a version, or `<type>/<short-description>` for isolated work.

```
feature/v4.2.0-transfer-market-filters
fix/v4.1.8-driver-name-truncation
chore/v4.1.7-tech-debt
hotfix/qualifying-crash-loop
```

### 9.2 Commit Messages — Conventional Commits

Format: `<type>(<scope>): <imperative description>`

| Type | When |
|---|---|
| `feat` | New user-facing feature |
| `fix` | Bug fix |
| `chore` | Tooling, deps, config |
| `refactor` | Code restructure with no behavior change |
| `docs` | Documentation only |
| `style` | Formatting, i18n, visual tweaks |
| `test` | Adding or fixing tests |

### 9.3 Pull Request Structure

Every PR must include these three sections:

```markdown
## Motivation
<Why this change was needed — the problem, constraint, or decision behind it.>

## Summary
<What changed — bullet points.>

## Test plan
<Checklist of what to verify manually.>
```

The **Motivation** section is mandatory — it's the long-term record of *why*, which is never obvious from the diff alone.

### 9.4 Versioning Strategy

- **Patch** (`4.1.x`) — fixes and chore branches
- **Minor** (`4.x.0`) — feature branches adding new functionality
- **Major** (`x.0.0`) — reserved for architectural rewrites

## 10. Multi-Task Execution Rule

When the user requests multiple fixes or tasks in a single message, **execute them sequentially, one at a time**. Do not parallelize work across independent tasks.

**Required process:**
1. Pick the first task (prioritize by urgency if indicated).
2. Investigate it fully — read all relevant files before writing code.
3. Implement the fix.
4. Confirm it is correct (verify the right fields, conditions, and data flow).
5. Only then move to the next task.

**Rationale:** Parallel execution causes assumptions to go unverified and fixes to target the wrong fields or conditions — leading to bugs that are worse than the originals.

---

## 11. Flutter Deprecation Status

The Flutter codebase (`lib/`, `android/`, `pubspec.yaml`) is **100% migrated** to Svelte. It is kept for reference only. **Do not modify any Flutter files.**

All features previously in Flutter are now implemented in `frontend/`. The Flutter code may be deleted from the repository at any time.
