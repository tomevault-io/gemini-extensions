# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code (claude.ai/code) working in this repository.

## What this is

`manygit` — a lazygit-style terminal UI for a whole **tree** of git repos. Point it
at a folder; it walks three levels down (skipping `node_modules`, `vendor`, `dist`,
…), groups every repo it finds by parent, and lets you fetch / pull / push /
checkout the one under the cursor. Go 1.24, Bubble Tea + Lip Gloss, single binary.

Published to GitHub Pages from `docs/` → <https://rabeeh-ta.github.io/manygit/>.

## The rule: the landing-page demo mirrors the TUI

**`docs/` contains a working browser port of the TUI. When you change a feature in
the Go CLI, update the demo in the same change.** It is not a screenshot or a
recording — it is a real reimplementation of the interaction model, and the page
tells visitors "the keys are the real keys". A demo that drifts from the binary
makes the page lie.

This applies to: a new/changed keybinding, a new pane or tab, a renamed pane, a
changed status glyph, a new theme, a new settings row, a changed empty/error
state, or new copy in the footer/help.

### Where things map

| Go (source of truth) | Browser port |
|---|---|
| `internal/tui/update.go` → `handleKey` | `docs/assets/demo.js` → `handleKey` |
| `internal/tui/view.go` → `syncGlyph`, `renderRow`, `tabBar`, `overlayTabs`, `overlayHead`, `window`, `centerBlock` | `demo.js` → same names, ported deliberately |
| `internal/tui/theme.go` → `themeList` | `docs/assets/site.css` → `:root[data-theme=…]` blocks |
| `internal/tui/settings.go` → `settingRows` | `demo.js` → `settingRows` |
| `internal/discover` → repo/script discovery | `demo.js` → the `REPOS` / `SCRIPTS` fixtures |
| `README.md` key table | `docs/index.html` → the Keys section |

Ported functions keep their Go names on purpose — grep the name in both files.

**There are FOUR mirrors of the key table, not two.** A key change has to land in
all of them or the product and the site disagree:
`internal/tui/view.go` → `keysBody` (the in-app reference), `README.md`,
`docs/index.html` → the Keys section, and **`docs/llms.txt`** — which is
git-tracked and published from `docs/` alongside the page, and is the one people
forget.

Two more move with a key change and are just as easy to miss: `view.go` →
`footer()` (the always-visible hint strip, mirrored in `demo.js`'s
`statusOrFilter`), and the **Safety** sections in `README.md`, `docs/index.html`
and `docs/llms.txt` — those make claims about what manygit can do to your repos,
so a key that widens what it can do has to be reflected there or the page is
lying. Adding `!` is what surfaced this.

### Rules the port must keep

- **Copy strings verbatim** from the Go where the demo shows one (empty states,
  status messages, hints). If the Go says `You're all caught up`, so does the demo.
  Don't "improve" it in the port — change the Go, then re-port.
- **Themes are chrome only.** `theme.go` themes `accent/group/dim/error` and
  nothing else; the page does the same. Status colours (`ok`, `↑N`, `*N`, …) stay
  fixed across themes, per theme.go's own comment.
- **`--dim` is not a prose colour.** It's the terminal's chrome colour and fails
  WCAG AA on this background in several themes. Page text uses `--muted`, which is
  each theme's `--dim` lifted to ≥4.5:1. Terminal-internal text keeps `--dim`.
- **Two independent axes: `data-mode` × `data-theme`.** `data-mode` (light/dark)
  is the *ground* and belongs to the site, because manygit has no background
  setting — it inherits your terminal's. `data-theme` is the *chrome* and is
  manygit's. They compose: six themes × two grounds = twelve palettes, and every
  one must clear AA. A new theme means adding **both** a
  `:root[data-theme=…]` block and a `:root[data-mode="light"][data-theme=…]` one
  — theme.go's accents are tuned for a dark terminal and none of them pass on
  paper unmodified. Darken hue-preserving and **measure**; don't eyeball.
- **The demo intentionally diverges in exactly five places**, all because it runs
  in a browser:
  1. `q` explains itself instead of quitting.
  2. `o` explains itself instead of spawning an editor.
  3. **`esc` releases the keyboard when it has nothing else to do.** The widget
     swallows `tab` *and* `shift+tab` (both cycle panes), so without an exit a
     keyboard user is trapped — WCAG 2.1.2. `esc` keeps its real meaning inside
     the Changes pane and any overlay/filter/confirm; only the otherwise-inert
     case is spent on blurring. If you rebind `esc` in the Go, find the demo a new
     exit **and say so in the `aria-label` and the visible cue** — an undisclosed
     escape hatch is the same as none.
  4. **`:` replies from a canned script instead of an AI harness.** A browser has
     neither `claude` nor git, so `cannedPlan()` recognises a few request shapes
     and returns a plan for them. Everything *around* the fake is real and ported:
     the input, the ghost-text completion, the validator refusing a force-push,
     the confirm, and stop-at-first-failure. The page says the reply is scripted,
     the same way it says the git is fake — if you extend `cannedPlan`, keep that
     label true and never let it imply the model is actually running.

  5. **`!` prints canned output instead of running a shell.** A browser has no
     bash, so `cannedShell()` answers a few command shapes and everything else
     says the shell is faked. Everything around it is real and ported: the repo
     binding, the input line that stays open between commands, the history, the
     echoed `<repo> $ <cmd>`, the streaming into the Output pane, and `esc`
     leaving the mode without stopping the run. The page says the shell
     output is scripted, the same way it says the git is fake — if you extend
     `cannedShell`, keep that label true.

  Keep all five, and keep them honest.
- **`runInit()` is a port of `Init()`, not an animation.** First focus replays the
  real launch: every repo unloaded and immediately fetching, so a row goes
  `.` → `~` → its glyph as the local status read lands and then the fetch returns;
  `loadContextCmd` fills Branches/Graph; `ghProbeCmd` reveals the badge and
  `github:`; the harness summarises. Only the *durations* are invented — the
  order is Init's, and the fetch waves are `cfg.Concurrency` (8). Anything gated
  on `repoVM.loaded` in the Go must be gated here too: an unloaded row has no
  branch and no dirty badge, because `r.status` is the zero value until
  `statusMsg` lands.
- The demo fakes git. It must never claim otherwise.

### Verifying a demo change

There are no tests for `docs/` — drive it:

```bash
cd docs && python3 -m http.server 8765   # then open http://localhost:8765
node --check assets/demo.js              # syntax
```

Press the keys you changed. Check the pane still renders, there are no console
errors, and the page has no horizontal overflow at 320px.

## Working conventions

- **Don't commit on your own — the user is the default committer.** Make the file
  changes and stop; the user reviews and commits. Never run a state-mutating `git`
  command (`add`/`commit`/`branch`/`push`/`reset`/`rebase`/`tag`/…) on your own
  initiative, and don't "helpfully" stage one — this holds even when a change is
  finished and verified. **The one exception: when the user explicitly tells you
  to commit (or push), you may** — do exactly what they asked, then stop.
  Read-only `status`/`log`/`diff`/`show` is always fine.
- `preview-shots/` is gitignored — local screenshots of `docs/`, never committed.
- The site is three static files and needs no build step. Keep it that way: no
  bundler, no framework, all asset paths **relative** (Pages serves it from the
  `/manygit/` subpath, so a leading `/` 404s).

## Post-update changelog

After a self-update, manygit shows the release notes **once**, scrollable
(`internal/tui/changelog.go` + `changelogView` in `view.go`). Mechanism, so it
isn't re-derived wrong later:

- **Storage**: the GitHub Release `body`, one per tag. Never packaged in the
  binary — `selfupdate.Releases()` fetches it over the API. `.goreleaser.yaml`'s
  `changelog:` block groups commits into Features / Fixes.
- **Trigger**: the updater injects `MANYGIT_UPDATED_FROM=<old version>` into the
  env of the binary it re-execs (`main.go`). Only that sets it, so a fresh
  install / `go install` never shows the screen. A `changelog-seen` marker in the
  cache dir makes it fire exactly once per update even across restarts.
- **Fails soft**: offline or API error → no screen, app launches normally.
- **The browser demo is deliberately NOT changed for this.** The screen has no
  keybinding — it can only appear via the update handoff, which a browser can't
  do. There's nothing in the "keys are the real keys" model to port, and faking a
  trigger would make the demo claim a key that doesn't exist. If a key to
  *re-open* the changelog is ever added, that's when the demo gets it.

## Releasing

Push a `v*` tag; GitHub Actions + goreleaser build the binaries and publish the
release. The installer and self-updater pick it up. The version comes from the
tag — nothing in the code needs editing.

```bash
git tag v1.0.7 && git push origin v1.0.7
```

## Gotcha: lipgloss `Width` hard-wraps

`lipgloss.NewStyle().Width(n)` does **not** pad-or-overflow — it hard-wraps
anything wider than `n`, mid-word. `keysBody` hit this with `Width(8)` while
`left/right` (10), `no-remote` (9) and `shift+tab` (9) all exceeded it, rendering
the `?` → `tab` screen as:

```
  left/rig
ht      hop between Repos and Branches
```

It's `Width(10)` now, and `TestTUI_KeyColumnFitsEveryLabel` fails if a label ever
outgrows the column again. Keep that in mind anywhere a fixed-width cell holds
caller-supplied text.
