# AGENTS.md — LapScope

Working knowledge for AI agents (and humans) touching this repo: workflow rules
and the hard-won behavioral facts that must not be re-derived or regressed.

## Documentation map — read in this order

1. **This file** — dev workflow, FH6 packet facts, the event-detection model,
   test matrix. The *why* behind the code.
2. **[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)** — what lives where: file
   responsibilities, data flow, DB schema, API surface, WebSocket contract,
   concurrency rules, simulator flags, and the cross-file invariants that must
   stay in sync. Consult it before touching anything structural.
3. **[README.md](README.md)** — user-facing: setup, in-game settings, quick
   troubleshooting. Kept deliberately basic — deep material goes on the wiki.
4. **Wiki** (source: [docs/wiki/](docs/wiki/)) — user-facing deep dives:
   Troubleshooting, Capturing-an-Unrecognized-Event, FH6-Data-Out-Packet,
   Event-Detection (+ `_Sidebar`/`_Footer`). Mirrored to the GitHub wiki by
   [.github/workflows/wiki.yml](.github/workflows/wiki.yml) on every merge to
   `main`; `docs/wiki/` is the **source of truth — never edit the wiki on
   GitHub**, the next sync overwrites it. Pages link each other wiki-style
   (`[text](Page-Name)`, no `.md` — resolves only on the published wiki) and
   link repo files/images by absolute URL
   (`https://github.com/darcane/LapScope/blob/main/…`,
   `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/darcane/LapScope/main/…`).
5. **[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/darcane/LapScope/issues)** — the open
   backlog: bugs, feature ideas, and in-flight investigations. (The old
   `TODO.md` is retired; everything it tracked lives in the issue tracker now.)

Keep all five current: a detection change usually touches this file's model
section **and** the wiki's Event-Detection page; a new endpoint/table belongs
in ARCHITECTURE.md; a new user-visible feature in the README; a change to
packet understanding, troubleshooting steps, or the capture workflow updates
the matching `docs/wiki/` page **in the same PR**; an issue gets closed when
its work lands, and new bugs/ideas discovered along the way get filed as
issues — never appended to a file.

## What this is

A single-container FastAPI app that receives Forza Horizon 6 "Data Out" UDP
telemetry, shows a live dashboard, and records sessions/laps into SQLite for lap
analysis. Vanilla-JS frontend, no build step. The recorder's decisions are
covered by a fast headless `pytest` harness (drives the simulator's scenarios
straight through `SessionTracker`, no game or container — see
[tests/](tests/)); running the simulator against the live container is still the
way to verify the frontend and the real UDP path.

## Dev workflow (important, non-obvious)

- **After each iteration of changes, create a local git commit.** **Never push
  to a remote** — the owner handles pushing themselves.
- **Work item → branch → PR.** Pick an item from the
  [issue tracker](https://github.com/darcane/LapScope/issues), cut a `feat/…`
  or `fix/…` branch off `main`, commit there, and land it via a pull request
  with CI green — not by committing straight to `main`. `main` is the
  protected, release branch. The owner pushes and opens the PR.
- **Static files are baked into the image.** Any change under `app/` requires
  `docker compose build` + restart. There is no bind mount for code.
- **Only `desktop/ui.py` may import tkinter.** The rest of the launcher
  (`state.py`, `logs.py`, `server.py`, `paths.py`) has to stay importable on a
  headless Linux box, because that is where CI runs and it is the only reason
  any of that logic is testable. Put decisions in those modules and keep
  `ui.py` to painting and event wiring. `tests/test_desktop_no_tkinter.py`
  fails if this slips.
- **The exe is windowed** (`console=False`), so `sys.stdout` and `sys.stderr`
  are `None` in the frozen build: nothing on the exe's import path may
  `print()`. Anything the user needs to see goes through `logging` — it reaches
  both the window's log pane and `DATA_DIR/logs/lapscope.log`. CI never builds
  the exe; the release workflow's `LS_DESKTOP_SELFTEST` step is what catches
  this class of break, so run it locally if you touch `run_desktop.py`,
  `LapScope.spec`, or `desktop/`.
- The Claude Code preview config (`.claude/launch.json`) runs `docker compose up`
  and owns the process — stop the preview server AND `docker compose down` before
  rebuilding, then start the preview again.
- **Run the tests before opening a PR** — CI runs the same on every PR. From the
  repo root: `pytest -q` and `ruff check .` (install the tooling once with
  `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt`). The recorder scenarios in
  `tests/test_scenarios.py` are the matrix at the bottom of this file, driven
  headlessly through `SessionTracker` in ~2 s by a fake-socket harness
  (`tests/harness.py`) — no container, no real-time wait.
- Verify with the simulator (no game needed), from the repo root:
  `python tools/simulator.py [--wet] [--dirty] [--race N] [--sprint SECS] [--dirt SECS] [--jumps]`.
  It runs in real time (60 Hz), so a 180 s scenario takes 3 minutes — run it in the
  background and watch `docker compose logs -f` for the recorder's decisions.
- Sessions close ~15 s after packets stop (`RACE_OFF_GRACE`); wait for the
  "Session N ended/discarded" log line before asserting on the API.
- DB lives in `./data/telemetry.db` (bind mount, gitignored). Schema changes go in
  `store.MIGRATIONS` as `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN` statements — they run on every
  startup, and **only** "duplicate column" is swallowed (a locked or readonly
  database must not silently no-op every ALTER). `store.SCHEMA_VERSION` is stamped
  into `PRAGMA user_version` afterwards; bump it for a change that isn't an
  idempotent ADD COLUMN, and keep `tests/test_store.py`'s upgrade test honest.
- Deleting sessions never shrinks the file — freed pages go on the freelist and
  stay there. `Store.vacuum()` (Settings → Storage → Compact now) is the only
  thing that returns bytes to the drive; `auto_vacuum` can't help an existing
  database, which is why it isn't set.
- SQLite threading rule: the single `Store.db` connection is event-loop-thread
  only. API handlers run in FastAPI's threadpool and must use `Store.reader()`
  (short-lived connection; fine for small writes too, thanks to WAL).
- Every store write commits on its own. Wrap a multi-step write that must not
  land half-done in `store.transaction()` (it defers those commits and rolls
  the batch back on any exception). It groups the event-loop connection only:
  a `reader()` opened inside one sees the *old* data, so don't read back what
  you just wrote until the block has exited.
- **The recording path must never raise.** `SessionTracker.flush()` runs from
  the UDP callback, where an exception is caught and logged with a traceback —
  per packet. A failing write (disk full, database locked) is therefore
  swallowed there: logged once on the way in and once on recovery, buffer
  capped at `FRAME_BUFFER_MAX` dropping oldest first, state exposed as
  `write_error` / `frames_dropped` on `/api/status` and as a banner on the
  dashboard. Keep any new per-frame work inside that contract.
- **The API is reachable from the user's browser, so it has a boundary.**
  `main.check_host` refuses a `Host` that is neither `localhost`, a `.local`
  name, an IP literal, nor in `LS_ALLOWED_HOSTS` (DNS rebinding always arrives
  with a borrowed *name*); `/ws/live` refuses a cross-origin handshake, since
  WebSockets skip CORS; and anything accepting a raw body must require its
  content type, or it is a CORS-simple request any page can POST to. A new
  endpoint that reads a body inherits all three concerns.
- **A write the user can't see fail is a write that didn't happen.** Every API
  call on the Analysis page goes through `apiFetch` (common.js): it throws on a
  network failure or a non-2xx and reports it once, so nothing is left to a
  bare `fetch` whose `onclick` never awaits it. Use it for new calls; pass
  `quiet: true` only for something on a timer, where the connection chip
  speaks instead.
- **Anything clickable must be focusable.** New controls are
  `<button type="button">`, not a `<div onclick>` — with `aria-pressed` for a
  toggle and `role="checkbox"` + `aria-checked` for a multi-select row. A
  canvas needs `role="img"` and an `aria-label` saying what it shows, and any
  animation that loops forever needs a line in style.css's
  `prefers-reduced-motion` block.
- **Per-event work belongs in a frame.** `resize`, `pointermove` and `wheel`
  fire far faster than a redraw costs: wrap the handler in `rafThrottle`
  (common.js), resize uPlot with `setSize()` instead of rebuilding it, and
  reassign a canvas's `width`/`height` only when the pixel size really changed
  (each assignment reallocates the backing store — and resets the transform,
  so a skipped one has to `setTransform` by hand).
- **A new feature is not a new header button.** The Analysis header grew one
  per iteration until twelve controls shared a wrapping row and Delete landed
  wherever the title's length pushed it. Actions go in the ⋯ `menuButton`
  (common.js) with a `hint` line stating what the action reaches; only
  something contextual, with a moment to act on, earns a place in the row.
- **A name is edited where it is shown.** Three menu entries that all start
  with a naming verb are a choice made in the abstract, so the session title,
  the car chip's name and the route chip's name are each the button that
  renames that thing. Facts that describe one object (class, PI, car name,
  drivetrain) render as one chip, not as badges in one row and muted text in
  another.
- **Chrome for an empty list is not neutral — it's the first impression.** A
  brand-new install opened Analysis onto a search box, five facet dropdowns, a
  "0 sessions" counter and a sort picker, all filtering nothing, and was asked
  90 seconds into its first drive whether to merge its run groups. Anything
  that only makes sense once there is history (the browse bar, the header hint
  chip, the merge banner) stays out of the way until there is; anything shown
  at zero has to say what to do next, in words someone who just double-clicked
  an exe can act on — "or run the simulator" names a script they do not have.
- **Every outbound call is opt-out-able.** "No cloud, no account, your data
  stays on your machine" is the pitch, so a new request to anything off this
  machine waits on `onlineAllowed()` (common.js — the per-browser setting AND
  `LS_OFFLINE`) and gets a line in the README's "What LapScope contacts". A
  server-side one refuses with a 403 naming the switch: nothing failed, this
  install is not allowed.

## FH6 packet facts (hard-won, don't re-derive)

- Fixed **324-byte** little-endian packet per rendered frame; FH5 "Dash" layout
  plus `CarGroup/SmashableVelDiff/SmashableMass` at offsets 232–243 and one
  undocumented trailing pad byte. Parser: `app/telemetry/packet.py` (verified by
  round-trip self-test and against the real game).
- **Not in the packet** (features must work around these): route/track names,
  car name strings, weather, game mode (Rivals/race/free-roam), lap-invalidated
  flag, rival/opponent data. Game mode is *inferred* instead — see
  `SessionTracker.race_mode` below.
- **`IsRaceOn` is 1 in free roam too** — it only separates driving from menus.
  Events vs cruising: races grid you with `RacePosition > 0` from the very first
  countdown frame; WTA / point-to-point events reset `DistanceTraveled` to 0 at
  launch; free roam has neither (verified on real captures, 2026-07-02).
- **`Velocity*` is car-local** like `Acceleration*`: ~`(0, 0, speed)` whatever
  the world direction — useless for heading. `Yaw` IS world-space: the car moves
  along `(sin yaw, cos yaw)` in world X/Z (verified against position deltas).
- **`DistanceTraveled` is NOT meters** on real circuits: it is *normalized route
  progress*, running 0 → ~5950 over a full route **whatever the route** — not a
  per-route constant that scales with length. Swept over ~90 recorded sessions
  on ~56 distinct routes (2026-07-27): every completed one lands in 5949–5959
  while the true driven length ranges 2.1–6.9 km, so the ratio to real metres
  swings 0.86×–2.84×. Partial runs land short of ~5950. Perfect for aligning
  laps within a route; **useless for telling routes apart** (see the route
  fingerprint below — this is what issue #53 tripped over), and never display
  it as a length (integrate `Speed` for that). The simulator emits true
  meters, so this quirk only shows on real-game data.
- `DrivetrainType`: 0=FWD 1=RWD 2=AWD. `CarClass`: index into D,C,B,A,S1,S2,R,X
  (R is new in FH6: 901–998 PI; X is 999 only — verified on a real 998 car).
- Wheel arrays are ordered FL, FR, RL, RR. `TireTemp` is Fahrenheit.
- **`TireCombinedSlip` does NOT discriminate surface** (swept across all
  stored captures, 2026-07-12): it tracks driver aggression — hard tarmac
  laps sustain *more* slip than clean dirt runs. Surface detection uses
  suspension roughness + jump rate instead.
- **`NormalizedDrivingLine` saturates at ±127 far off the course**; during
  events it sits mid-range 73–97 % of frames on every surface (dirt courses
  have a driving line too). Used as the on-course gate for surface evidence.
  `NormalizedAIBrakeDifference` is ~0 on most frames — no useful signal.
  Free-roam behavior of both is **unverified** (free-roam sessions are
  discarded, so no stored captures to check against).
- The game binds its own socket on ports **5200–5300** — never use them.
- Xbox-app (UWP) builds may block loopback; fallbacks documented in README.

## Event-detection model (laps.py is the heart)

The game gives no explicit session/event boundaries; `SessionTracker` infers them.
All the rules exist because some real behavior broke a naive version:

- Session = `IsRaceOn` stretch, ends after 15 s of race-off or silence.
- `CurrentRaceTime` warping back to ~0 splits sessions (event restarts,
  free-roam time-attacks).
- **Finishes don't increment `LapNumber`.** Five signals: `LastLap` changing
  while `LapNumber` is static; **the `DistanceTraveled` hard-reset** (the real
  point-to-point finish, below); the race clock freezing ≥1.5 s while `IsRaceOn`
  stays 1 (a fallback finish-cinematic signal); **the stream cutting dead at the
  finish line** (real circuit races, verified: the last packet lands within
  meters of the line — an open lap that covered ≥97% of the session's typical
  lap length is completed from the lap clock's last reading plus the remaining
  meters at the last speed); and the same cutoff on a *gridded point-to-point
  race* with no laps to compare distance against (gridded, launched from a
  `DistanceTraveled` reset, `LapNumber` never incremented, real distance
  covered, cut at speed → timed launch-to-line, flagged `cutoff` 🏁 because a
  lap-one quit / game-close looks identical). Abandoned events with none of
  these signatures are discarded.
- **The real point-to-point finish is a `DistanceTraveled` hard-reset**
  (verified on a dirt-sprint capture, 2026-07-03: a "2018 Subaru WRX STI ARX"
  gridded event). The car crosses at speed, `RacePosition` drops to 0, the
  stream **gaps ~12 s for the results cinematic** (race clock counting through
  it), then the game hands control back **parked at the line, brake held
  (~75 %), gear 1, `DistanceTraveled` reset to 0** (this is the "gear 1 / 75 %
  brake, then gear R" the driver sees). The odometer only ever *accumulates* on
  circuits (never resets per lap), so a reset to ~0 is an unambiguous finish; it
  fires whether or not the lap fields are alive — **a dirt sprint runs
  `CurrentLap` the whole way while `LapNumber`/`LastLap`/`BestLap` stay 0**
  (so `_lap_fields_dead` is False and the geometric/WTA path never engages) —
  as long as `LapNumber` never incremented (not a circuit) and it's a real event
  (gridded, or a WTA geometric launch). Guards against a free-roam fast-travel
  (which also zeroes the odometer): the run must have covered real distance
  (`_prev_dist > WTA_MIN_LAP_DIST`) and the car must **stay put** across the
  reset (`< 250 m` — a fast-travel teleports you away). The run is completed
  right there and timed **launch-to-line**: `_finish_rt` is the *previous*
  frame's clock (the cinematic gap advanced the current one), minus `_launch_rt`
  (the clock when `DistanceTraveled` first grew), so the countdown is excluded —
  matching the game's own convention (a circuit lap's `LastLap` = launch-to-line,
  not clock-start-to-line, verified on session 22). Simulate with
  `python tools/simulator.py --dirt 40`.
- **Not every point-to-point does the handback — a touge cut Data Out dead at
  the line instead** (verified 2026-07-04: gridded 1v1, `CurrentLap` counting,
  crossing at 57 m/s with `RacePosition` 1 and `IsRaceOn` still 1, then the
  stream just stops — no reset, no freeze, no handback). That's the circuit
  cut-dead finish on a gridded point-to-point with the lap fields alive, so it
  reaches session end with an open lap and no `_event_finished`. Recovered by
  `_ptp_run_time_at_cutoff`: gridded, `_launch_rt` set, `LapNumber` never
  incremented (circuits recover their final lap via `_final_lap_time_at_cutoff`
  instead), real distance covered, still at speed → run timed launch-to-line,
  flagged `cutoff`. Simulate with `python tools/simulator.py --dirt 40 --cut`.
  **Cross-country shares this exact signature** (verified 2026-07-05, session 55:
  gridded start P8→P3, `CurrentLap` counting the whole way with `LapNumber` at 0,
  stream cut dead at the line at 67 m/s) — recovered by the same gridded cut-dead
  path, timed launch-to-line = 144.747 s, `cutoff`. No separate handling; it was
  the last unconfirmed point-to-point type, so all known event types are covered.
- Point-to-point events may never start `CurrentLap`; lap traces and the live
  delta fall back to race-time-elapsed-since-lap-open.
- **World Time Attack broadcasts no lap fields at all** (real capture, 2026-07-02:
  LapNumber/CurrentLap/LastLap/BestLap all 0 for the whole event; the clock counts
  from event *load*, through a teleport + grid hold with `DistanceTraveled` pinned
  at 0). Laps are detected geometrically (`_wta_logic`): launch = distance starts
  growing → anchor + lap re-based there; a lap completes at the closest approach
  to the anchor after being ≥120 m away, traveling within ~75° of the launch
  heading, having covered ≥500 dist-units. The run finish is `DistanceTraveled`
  hard-resetting (~18000 → 0) while the clock keeps counting; the post-finish
  coast "lap" is deleted. A crossing normally finalizes when the car *exits*
  the crossing circle; a stream that dies inside it instead has the pending
  closest approach finalized at session end, flagged `cutoff` (simulate with
  `--wta 3 --cut`). A single-frame position jump >250 m (fast travel)
  disarms the geometric detection — you never teleport mid-run, so it's a
  free-roam giveaway. Remaining caveat: a fresh-boot free-roam session starting
  at `DistanceTraveled` 0 that loops back over its start point *without*
  teleporting can still produce a geometric lap — accepted trade-off.
- `SessionTracker.race_mode` (in the per-frame extras merged into every
  WebSocket frame, alongside `session_id`/`delta`/`lap_elapsed`): True while a
  timed event is running — `RacePosition > 0`, live lap fields, or the geometric
  launch anchor armed; False in free roam and once the event finishes (every
  finish signal drops it, including the LastLap-change finish). The
  dashboard gates the lap timer, the RACE MODE / FREE ROAM chip, and the live
  track map on it. Verified transitions on real captures: race = on from the
  first grid frame; WTA = off during event-load/grid-hold, on at launch, off at
  the finish-line distance collapse.
- `POST /api/sessions/{id}/reprocess` (UI: Reprocess button) replays stored
  frames through a fresh `SessionTracker` via `_ReplayStore` (laps/routes real,
  session row untouched, discard suppressed) — recovers laps recorded before a
  detection fix. Must stay `async def` (writes on the event-loop connection),
  which also means the replay blocks the loop — it 409s while **any** session
  is recording, or a long replay would freeze live telemetry mid-race. It
  deletes the old laps before rebuilding, so the whole replay runs inside one
  `store.transaction()`: anything that raises rolls the delete back. Without it
  a crash mid-replay wiped the session's lap times for good — the same frames
  crash the same way on every retry.
- **Manual edits are read-time overrides** (analysis page: dismiss a contact
  marker, re-tag a lap's flags, exclude a lap from bests/counts). They live in
  the `edits` table keyed by **frame timestamps, never lap ids** — a reprocess
  deletes and recreates lap rows (SQLite reuses the rowids!), so id-keyed
  edits would silently attach to the wrong laps; time-keyed ones re-apply to
  the rebuilt laps by design (they're user intent). Raw frames and the
  recorder's `laps.flags` are never rewritten; `Store.session_laps` merges the
  overrides in (`flags` effective, `flags_auto` detected, `excluded`), and
  `DELETE /api/sessions/{id}/edits` ("Reset edits") is the escape hatch back
  to pure detection. An edit anchor matches a lap on a **half-open** span
  (`started_t <= anchor < ended_t`) because consecutive laps share a frame —
  with both ends inclusive, excluding a trailing open lap also excluded the
  timed lap before it. Four places implement that rule (`lap_span`, the
  `_SESSION_SELECT` overlay behind `lap_count`/`best_lap`, `remove_edits`,
  `dismiss_contact`); change one and you must change all four.
- `sessions.kept = 1` exempts a session from the startup no-laps cleanup
  (LS_KEEP_DISCARDED captures and reprocessed sessions set it). That same
  startup pass (`cleanup_sessions`) also closes what a crash left open —
  `sessions.ended_at` **and** the last `laps.ended_t` — from the session's last
  frame. It runs before the tracker exists and must stay there: it would close
  a live session's open rows.
- Dirty-lap inference: rewind = lap clock below its high-water mark while
  distance doesn't grow (per-frame comparison misses gradual scrubs — that bug
  shipped once); contact = ground-plane |accel| ≥ 45 m/s² **that also looks
  like an impulse** (below). Stored as `laps.flags` ("rewind,contact").
- **45 m/s² alone is not contact — the burst must have an impact's *shape*.**
  That threshold assumed no car corners that hard on tires; downforce cars
  break the assumption, sustaining 5–7.7 g of pure lateral g through fast
  corners, so they used to flag *every* lap (session 187, Alfa Group C: 530
  markers in 39 laps, 13.6/lap, all 39 flagged including the clean best).
  Magnitude can't separate the two; the rise can. Aero load builds over
  hundreds of ms, an impact is an impulse — so a non-landing burst counts only
  when some frame of it either gained `IMPACT_JERK` (30 m/s², ~3 g) over the
  previous frame, or reached `IMPACT_PEAK` (98 m/s², ~10 g). `impulsive()` in
  laps.py is the one implementation, imported by `_scan_lap`; dashboard.js
  mirrors it. Swept over all 70 stored sessions / 1813 bursts (2026-07-26,
  same dump/hand-classify method as the landing classifier): of the 1334
  bursts rising slower than 1 g/frame **not one** reached 10 g, and the
  histogram has an empty valley at 1.5–3 g/frame. Effect is *selective*, not
  merely stricter — 187: 530→46, 129 (Furai): 338→7, A-641 session 117: 82→0,
  while cross-country/dirt sessions barely move (55: 7→6, 103: 5→5, 8: 13→9)
  and the low-downforce control (146, Diablo SV) was 0 before and after.
  Only jerk is *causal* (one frame of history), which is why it and not burst
  duration or speed-delta drives the live recorder and dashboard.js.
  `IMPACT_JERK_DT_MAX` (0.05 s) ignores a jerk read across a stream gap or a
  rewind splice — the gap manufactures it. Rejected bursts are dropped
  outright (issue #49).
  **Jump landings are excused** and are classified *first*, so the impulse
  gate never sees them (a touchdown slam is an impulse and would pass it):
  a spike while
  airborne (all four `NormalizedSuspensionTravel` < 0.15 **and** all four
  `TireCombinedSlip` < 0.05 for ≥ 0.12 s — in flight wheels hang at full droop
  with zero tire force) or within 0.35 s of touchdown is a landing, not contact
  (`AIRBORNE_*` / `LANDING_GRACE_S` in laps.py, mirrored in dashboard.js).
  Calibrated on real cross-country (session 55: 5 of 12 spikes were landings —
  touchdown compresses the suspension 1–2 frames *before* the spike, and
  suspension drifts up to ~0.11 mid-flight, hence the loose thresholds and the
  grace window; verified to change nothing on circuit sessions 5/6/35).
  `/laps/{id}/data` tags collision bursts `landing: true/false` the same way —
  the analysis map draws landings amber, the Contacts stat counts only real
  ones. **Known remaining limit:** light Rivals wall-scrapes stay below the
  threshold (false negatives; there is no lap-invalidated packet field to
  cross-check against) — tracked in
  [issue #27](https://github.com/darcane/LapScope/issues/27), and now more
  tractable: with contact qualified by *shape*, `IMPACT_ACCEL` could be
  lowered to reach light scrapes without re-flooding downforce cars (still
  needs labeled scrape captures first). A wall hit inside the 0.35 s post-landing grace is also excused
  (accepted trade-off). Flags reset when a lap re-anchors (the WTA launch, a
  mid-session lap-timer start): pre-launch junk frames must not dirty lap 1.
  Test-fixture gotcha: `empty_fields()` zeroes suspension and slip, which
  reads as *airborne* — hand-built test frames must set grounded values or
  every contact spike gets excused (Driver in test_tracker.py does).
- Routes are fingerprinted (start pos within 120 m + length within 5% + the
  lap's bounding-box dimensions within 15%, floor 50 m); names apply to every
  session on the route. The **span term carries
  it**: Horizon courses routinely share a start line and `DistanceTraveled`
  can't separate them (see above), so start + length alone collapsed different
  courses onto one row (#53). Spans are stable because they measure ground
  covered, not the line driven — an excursion or rewind adds distance but
  barely moves the extents (measured: ≤3.5% across laps of one course, ≥30%
  between courses off a shared start line). `span_x`/`span_z` NULL = row
  predates the term; the next matching lap adopts its shape, so reprocessing
  **both** sessions of an already-merged route is what unpicks it.
- **The same fingerprint names the route.** `app/track_catalog.json` maps the
  game's official courses to their names, so a fresh install gets "The Goliath"
  from the first completed lap instead of "Unnamed route" — the packet carries
  no track name, but the fingerprint transfers between installs. Generated by
  `tools/export_track_catalog.py` from a database where they have all been
  driven and named; **never hand-edit it**, re-run the tool. Precedence: a
  user's rename > `DATA_DIR/track_catalog.json` > the bundled file. Naming is
  guarded on the name being empty and `rename_route` clears `catalog_key`, so
  the catalogue can correct a name it supplied but can never overwrite a human's.
  A route with NULL spans can't be identified at all — that is the second
  reason to reprocess an old database, after unpicking merged routes.
- Sessions with zero completed laps/runs are discarded at close and again at
  startup (`cleanup_sessions`). Every discard logs a `diag:` signal summary
  (duration, race-time range, max LapNumber/CurrentLap, finish seen, gridded,
  launch anchor, last speed, distance); `LS_KEEP_DISCARDED=1` (compose env
  passthrough; a repo-root `.env` file works too) keeps such sessions instead —
  that's the capture path for event types the segmentation doesn't recognize
  yet. Inspect a kept capture with `python tools/inspect_session.py <id>`
  (`--list` to enumerate): it prints every signal transition the segmentation
  cares about, straight from `data/telemetry.db`, no container needed.
- Session ids are handed out by an in-memory monotonic counter
  (`Store._next_session_id`), never SQLite's rowid: discards delete the max
  rowid, which plain `INTEGER PRIMARY KEY` would reuse — and the live map
  resets on session-id *change*, so a reused id left stale points on screen.
- **Track types are auto-suggested at session close** (issue #28), written
  with COALESCE so a user tag always wins; the dropdown stays the override.
  Precedence: (1) another session on the same route carries a tag → inherit
  it (routes don't change surface; this propagates manual corrections);
  (2) geometric laps → `wtc` (loop closure to the launch anchor is
  near-certain WTA); (3) surface: ≥10 % rough suspension frames
  (travel rate > 2.8/s) at ≥0.7 jumps/min → `dirt`, ≥3.5 jumps/min →
  `cross`, ≤3 % rough and <0.7 jumps/min → `road`; in-between or thin
  evidence → no tag. Frames with `|NormalizedDrivingLine| = 127` (far off
  course) and flights taken off-course contribute **no** surface evidence —
  off-roading a tarmac event can't fake a dirt tag. Near-zero cornering
  (drag strips) → no tag. street/touge read as tarmac → suggested `road`
  (accepted; one manual correction sticks via route inheritance).
  Thresholds calibrated on the stored real captures (2026-07-12 sweep,
  dump/hand-label/DB-sweep like the landing classifier): 9/9 labeled
  sessions matched, 0 hard mismatches. Reprocess back-fills old sessions
  (`_ReplayStore.end_session` applies auto-tags only). Manually changing a
  session's type offers to retag the whole route (`PATCH /routes/{id}`
  `track_type`).
- The allowed track-type set lives in **three places that must stay in
  sync**: `TRACK_TYPES` (api/routes.py), `TRACK_META` (common.js), and the
  `#track-select` options (analysis.html) — plus everything
  `suggest_track_type` (laps.py) can return must be a member of
  `TRACK_TYPES` (locked by a test).

When changing `_lap_logic`, walk every branch against: circuit race with finish,
Rivals (endless laps), free-roam cruise, free-roam time-attack, sprint, dirt
sprint (CurrentLap counts + distance-reset finish), World
Time Attack (no lap fields), rewind mid-lap, rewind across the start line,
server joining mid-lap, event restart.

## Frontend conventions

- Vanilla JS + canvas; uPlot (vendored) only on the analysis page. No frameworks,
  no bundler — keep it that way, it's the point of the repo.
- Theme lives in CSS custom props in `style.css`; display font is vendored
  Rajdhani (OFL) in `app/static/fonts` — the app must work fully offline.
- Shared UI helpers (badges: class/PI, drivetrain, conditions, track type) live in
 `common.js` and are used by both pages.
- The analysis browse bar (`browse.js`) filters, searches and sorts **client-side**
 over the `/api/sessions` payload — the endpoint takes no query params on purpose.
 Keep it that way while the list is a few hundred rows; past a few thousand
 sessions add `?since=` / `?limit=` rather than more facets. Facets persist under
 their own `ls_browse` key, not in `ls_settings` (that one is display prefs).
- A merged run group is an **index over sessions**, never a rewrite of them:
 `session_groups` + `sessions.group_id` only. Ungrouping must always be free,
 and a member's frames, laps and manual edits must survive every group
 operation untouched. Membership is validated on write, never on read.
- `#session-list` is rebuilt only when its content signature changes and its
 `scrollTop` is restored when it is — the list re-renders on a 15 s poll and after
 every edit, and a naive `innerHTML = ""` scrolls the user back to the top.
- Menus, bars and other chrome get `cursor` and `user-select` set explicitly.
 `cursor: auto` over a block with text in it draws a text caret, so a popover's
 own padding shows an I-beam between its rows unless the popover says otherwise.
- Style modal fields by input **type**. A bare `.modal input` rule also hits the
 checkboxes callers put in `extra` (lap flags, merge list) and stretches them to
 `width: 100%`, which reads as a centred box with wrapped labels.
- User display preferences (units, map toggles) live in `settings.js`, stored
 **`localStorage`-only** under one `ls_settings` key — there is no backend for
 them and there should not be: the recorder stores raw packets and every
 conversion (`speedFromMps`, `tempFromF`, `distFromM`, …) is applied at display
 time, so units never touch stored data. Pages read via `getSettings()` and
 re-render through `onSettingsChange`. Migrated the pre-Settings `fc_mph` /
 `fc_mapmode` keys once on load.
- Server sends `Cache-Control: no-cache` for non-API paths (browsers cached stale
  JS once); keep that middleware.
- Canvas gauges are pure functions of passed state (`gauges.js`); DPR-scaled via
  `initCanvas`.
- The live track map resets on session-id change and on any single-frame
  position jump > 250 m (grid snap / event restart — a car can't move that far
  in 1/60 s; keeping the old points would wreck the bounds). The finished
  track intentionally stays on screen until the next event starts drawing.

## Testing scenarios that must keep passing

Each row is both a headless assertion in `tests/test_scenarios.py` (run through
the fake-socket harness — fast, no container) and a manual simulator command for
full-stack / visual checks. Keep the two in step: a new detection scenario needs
a row here, a test, and usually a simulator flag.

| Scenario | Command | Expected |
|---|---|---|
| Laps + wet + route | `--freeroam 20 --events 2 --wet` | free-roam discarded, 2 sessions, wet-tagged, same route |
| Dirty laps | `--duration 180 --dirty` | lap 2 `contact`, lap 3 `rewind`, charts deduped |
| Race finish | `--race 3 --duration 200` | 3 laps all timed (last via finish detection), no phantom open lap |
| Point-to-point | `--sprint 75` | session kept, single run ≈75 s, route assigned |
| Real dirt sprint | `--dirt 40` | single run ≈40 s (CurrentLap counts, `DistanceTraveled`-reset finish), route assigned, no phantom coast lap |
| Touge (cut at line) | `--dirt 40 --cut` | single run ≈40 s flagged `cutoff` (CurrentLap counts, stream cut dead at speed), route assigned |
| Sprint, stream cut at line | `--sprint 60 --cut` | session kept, single run ≈60 s flagged `cutoff`, route assigned |
| World Time Attack | `--wta 3` | launch + 3 geometric laps + distance-reset finish, no post-finish phantom lap |
| WTA, stream cut at the line | `--wta 3 --cut` | 3 geometric laps, last flagged `cutoff` (pending crossing finalized at session end), no phantom lap |
| Jumps in 3D | `--sprint 75 --jumps` (or any + `--jumps`) | 3D map scale sane, spikes capped, run NOT flagged `contact` (landings excused) |
| Track type: circuit/sprint | `--race 3` / `--sprint 75` | session auto-tagged `road` (smooth suspension, no jumps) |
| Track type: dirt | `--dirt 60` | auto-tagged `dirt` (washboard suspension, low jump rate) |
| Track type: cross | `--dirt 60 --jumps` | auto-tagged `cross` (dirt surface + a crest every few hundred meters) |
| Track type: WTA | `--wta 3` | auto-tagged `wtc` (geometric laps) |
| Track type: route inheritance | two events, same route | a tag set on the route's earlier session wins over telemetry for later ones |
| Landing vs contact | `--duration 180 --dirty --jumps` | lap 2 `contact` (wall hit), all other laps clean despite hard jump landings; `/laps/{id}/data` tags landing bursts `landing: true` (amber on the map) |
| Aero cornering vs contact | hand-built frames (`test_tracker.py`, `test_api.py`) | a burst that ramps past 45 m/s² and holds is *not* contact (no flag, no marker); a one-frame jump of `IMPACT_JERK` is, even mid-burst on top of aero load (issue #49) |
| Race-mode gating | `--freeroam 35 --race 3` | chip FREE ROAM then RACE MODE; timer dashed in free roam; live map draws the race only |
