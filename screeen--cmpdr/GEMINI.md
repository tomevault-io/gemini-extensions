# GitHub Copilot Instructions for cMVDR

## Project Overview

This is the cMVDR (Cyclic Minimum-Variance Distortionless-Response) beamformer project - a Python implementation of an advanced beamforming algorithm for audio signal processing. The project extends the classic MVDR beamformer to exploit both spatial and spectral correlations for better suppression of almost-periodic noise (e.g., engines, fans, musical instruments).

**Key application areas**: Speech enhancement, hearing aids, smart devices, and acoustic scene analysis.

**Research paper**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18391v1

## Development Environment

### Python Version
- **Required**: Python 3.9+ (for compatibility with librosa)
- **Tested on**: Python 3.11
- **OS tested**: macOS 14.4.1 and Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS

### Dependencies
- Core dependencies are managed in `pyproject.toml`
- Key libraries: librosa, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, sounddevice, pystoi, pesq, pysepm-evo
- Use pip for package management and installation

### Installation

**Step-by-step installation process:**

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:Screeen/cmvdr.git
cd cmvdr
```

2. Create and activate a Python virtual environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install the package in editable mode:
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -e .
```

This will automatically install all dependencies defined in `pyproject.toml`.

4. Verify installation:
```bash
python -c 'import cmvdr; print("cMVDR package successfully imported!")'
```

## Code Style and Conventions

### General Guidelines
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines for Python code
- Use type hints where appropriate to improve code clarity
- Write descriptive variable names, especially for signal processing variables
- Keep functions focused and modular

### Signal Processing Conventions
- Use standard variable naming for signal processing:
  - `M`: Number of microphones/channels
  - `K`: Number of frequency bins
  - `P`: Number of cyclic shifts
  - `rtf`: Relative transfer function
  - `mvdr`: Minimum variance distortionless response
- Complex-valued arrays should use `dtype=np.complex128`
- FFT/STFT operations should preserve proper scaling and normalization

### Documentation
- Include docstrings for all public functions and classes
- Document parameters, return values, and any important implementation details
- Reference academic papers or algorithms where applicable

## Testing

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
python -m unittest discover -s tests

# Run specific test file
python -m unittest tests.test_cyclic_mvdr

# Run with verbose output
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

### Test Structure
- Tests are located in the `tests/` directory
- Test files follow the naming convention `test_*.py`
- Use `unittest` framework for all tests
- Tests should be fast and focused on specific functionality
- Integration tests should use small data sizes to keep tests fast

### Writing Tests
- Set up test fixtures in `setUp()` method
- Use small array sizes (e.g., M=2, K=5) for fast execution
- Test edge cases (single channel, zero inputs, boundary conditions)
- Verify shapes and dtypes of outputs
- Use `np.allclose()` for floating-point comparisons

## Command-Line Tools

The package provides two CLI tools:

### cmvdr
Runs beamforming inference on audio files:
```bash
cmvdr -i INPUT_PATH [-o OUTPUT_PATH] [-n NOISE_PATH] [-v]
```

### cmvdr-eval
Evaluates audio quality metrics:
```bash
cmvdr-eval -d FOLDER_DENOISED [-r FOLDER_REFERENCE] [--sort-by-snr]
```

## Running Experiments

### Configuration
- Experiment parameters are in YAML files in `configs/` directory
- Main configuration files: `cmvdr.yaml`, `default.yaml`
- Inference configuration: `inference_cmvdr.yaml`

### Experiment Scripts
```bash
# Quick demo
source script/run_demo.sh

# Synthetic data experiments
source script/run_synthetic.sh

# All experiments
source script/run_all.sh

# Direct execution
python main.py --data_type synthetic  # or instruments
```

## Development Workflow

1. **Make changes**: Edit code in the appropriate module
2. **Run tests**: Verify changes don't break existing functionality
3. **Test locally**: Use demo scripts or CLI tools to validate
4. **Document**: Update docstrings and README if needed
5. **Commit**: Write clear, descriptive commit messages

## Common Patterns

### Working with Audio Signals
- Use librosa for audio I/O: `librosa.load()`, `sf.write()`
- STFT parameters are typically configured in preset files
- Maintain proper audio sample rates (typically 16 kHz or 48 kHz)

### Beamforming Pipeline
1. Load multichannel audio
2. Compute STFT
3. Estimate noise covariance
4. Compute beamformer weights
5. Apply beamformer
6. Inverse STFT
7. Save output

### Configuration Management
- Use YAML files for configuration
- Load configs with `yaml.safe_load()`
- Validate configuration parameters before use

## Important Notes

### Known Issues

#### Cannot import `kaiser` from `scipy.signal`
For scipy >= 1.4.0, if you see `ImportError: cannot import name 'kaiser' from 'scipy.signal'`, edit the pysepm util.py file to change:
```python
# Old import
from scipy.signal import firls,kaiser,upfirdn
# New import
from scipy.signal import firls,upfirdn
from scipy.signal.windows import kaiser
```

#### Installing without uv
If you don't have `uv` installed or prefer using standard pip, use the installation method above:
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate  
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -e .  # Use -e for editable installation
```

#### Package import issues after installation
If you installed the package with `pip install -e .` and have import issues, make sure:
1. Your virtual environment is activated
2. You're running Python from the correct environment
3. The installation completed without errors

You can verify the package is installed by running:
```bash
pip list | grep cmvdr
```

#### OSError: PortAudio library not found
Some systems may require the PortAudio library for audio playback (used by sounddevice).
Your Python package (`sounddevice` or something else that uses PortAudio) can't find the underlying PortAudio C library on your system.
Installing the Python package alone isn't enough — the native library must also be installed.
How you fix it depends on your OS. You can still run the experiments, but you won't be able to listen to the audio output.

#### ImportError: numpy.core.multiarray
If you encounter `ImportError: numpy.core.multiarray failed to import`, install PESQ directly from GitHub:
```bash
pip install https://github.com/ludlows/python-pesq/archive/master.zip
```
This is already included in `pyproject.toml` dependencies but may need reinstallation if issues occur.

### Performance Considerations
- Beamforming is computationally intensive
- Use appropriate FFT sizes for memory/speed tradeoff
- Consider using smaller data for testing/debugging

### Dataset Requirements
For reproducing paper experiments:
- Room impulse responses (RIRs) from RWTH Aachen database
- Clean speech from Speech Intelligibility CD
- Instrument samples from University of Iowa MIS database
