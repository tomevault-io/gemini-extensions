# Working in this repository

Use [docs/README.md](docs/README.md) to find the owning guidance before changing a contract. Product-agent usage belongs in [docs/agents.md](docs/agents.md) and the [design skill](skills/design-studio-ai/SKILL.md); this file governs repository work.

## Preserve the requested behavior

- Deliver the requested scope. Do not substitute mock provider responses, fake exports, or fixture projects for real behavior.
- Keep browser, REST, MCP, WebMCP and CLI edits on the shared validators and services. When changing a public contract, inspect each affected client and its documentation rather than introducing a second document format.
- Keep webapp features, API endpoints, CLI commands, MCP tools, WebMCP, official documentation, API documentation, the agent skill, `llms.txt`, and `llms-full.txt` synchronized in the same change. Follow the [documentation source and build ownership](docs/web-documentation.md); update source documents and regenerate derived references rather than editing generated output.
- Preserve separate brief and document revisions. Keep scope approval explicit; do not interpret unanswered questions as approval or bypass conflicts by retrying with a higher revision.
- Keep authorization and validation on the server. A UI check must not replace project ownership, OAuth scope, asset isolation, or revision checks.

## Prioritize people and agents

- Treat UX (User Experience) and AX (AI Agent Experience) as the highest product priorities. Evaluate each feature through both the human workflow and the agent workflow, including discoverability, feedback, errors, and recovery.
- Build mobile-first, responsive layouts and preserve cross-browser compatibility. Feature-detect browser-dependent capabilities and provide usable fallbacks. Verify affected interactions at mobile and desktop sizes, and report which browsers were actually tested; Chromium-only coverage does not establish cross-browser support.

## Protect data and credentials

- Add migrations; do not rewrite applied migration files or reset a deployed database to make a change pass.
- Never commit real dotenv files, provider keys, OAuth secrets, session tokens, or private user content. Use placeholders in examples; keep browser traces and screenshots free of credentials before sharing them.
- Preserve the existing `ENCRYPTION_KEY` across restarts and deployments. Read [deployment and backups](docs/deployment.md#backups-and-rollback) before changing persistence or secret storage.
- Keep tests isolated from real accounts and projects. The [production smoke script](scripts/smoke-production.mjs) creates accounts, calls renderers, and deletes its test data; do not use it as a routine local test.
- In Cloudflare server fetches, use `redirect: 'manual'` and reject redirect responses before forwarding credentials. Do not restore `redirect: 'error'`: the Workers runtime used here rejects that value. Follow the existing [provider transport](server/providers.ts) and [GitHub transport](server/github-login.ts).

## Run the appropriate checks

Use npm with the Node version declared in [package.json](package.json). Install both dependency trees on a fresh checkout: `npm ci` and `npm ci --prefix packages/cli`.

| Change | Verification |
| --- | --- |
| Focused TypeScript behavior | `npx tsx --test tests/briefs.test.ts`, substituting the relevant existing `*.test.ts` file |
| Renderer or publication behavior | Run `node scripts/build-renderer.mjs` before the focused test; install Chromium with `npx playwright install chromium` if absent |
| CLI behavior | Run `npm run build:cli` before `npx tsx --test tests/cli.test.ts` |
| Browser workflow | Run `npm run build`, then `npm run test:e2e -- tests/onboarding-ui.spec.ts --project=mobile`, substituting the affected spec/project |
| Shared contracts or cross-module implementation | `npm run typecheck`, `npm test`, and `npm run build`; rebuild the CLI first when running its tests |
| Documentation only | Check changed links, commands, configuration names and claims against their owners; do not start servers or rerun unrelated suites |

The [CI workflow](.github/workflows/ci.yml) owns the full release gates. Fix observed failures instead of weakening assertions or claiming an unrun check passed. Distinguish provider configuration/error checks from successful live generation, and inspect actual exported files before claiming format fidelity.

The TypeScript, unit and build gates always run in full. The browser lane is selected by [scripts/test-plan.mjs](scripts/test-plan.mjs) from the changed paths: pushes to `main`, CI-critical paths, unclassified paths and any selector error run every spec, documentation-only changes skip the browser lane, and everything else runs the mapped specs plus the always-run security set (`account-ui`, `oauth-browser`, `community-publish-ui`, `community-moderation-ui`, `workspace`). Reproduce a selection locally with `npm run test:e2e -- $(node scripts/test-plan.mjs --format=args)`; `npm run test:e2e` with no arguments still runs everything. Add a new spec to the area table in that script, or it runs on every code change by design.

Pushes to `main` and the [nightly workflow](.github/workflows/nightly.yml) execute the full browser suite, so a pull request only exercises the lanes mapped to its changed paths.

## Avoid competing processes and generated edits

- Use [scripts/run-e2e.mjs](scripts/run-e2e.mjs) through `npm run test:e2e` for isolated browser tests. Keep its per-device databases and production rate limits intact.
- Coordinate the E2E port before starting a review server. Do not run another harness on port 8791 while E2E owns it, or attach tests to an unrelated process that happens to answer health checks.
- Track servers you start by PID, port and checkout; reuse an existing owned process when appropriate, and stop your processes when finished. Never kill an unrelated listener to free a port.
- Edit renderer/viewer sources and public-doc components, then rebuild. Do not hand-edit `dist/`, `public/studio-renderer.js`, or `public/studio-viewer.js`; [build scripts](package.json) own those outputs.
- Run `npm pack` from `packages/cli` when packaging the CLI. Do not rely on `npm pack --prefix packages/cli`; that invocation packaged the repository root in this environment.

## Finish without creating documentation drift

- Update the smallest owning document when behavior, setup, security or a public contract changes. Link to executable owners rather than copying schemas, command inventories, or test counts into more files.
- Keep plans and release evidence under `plans/`; do not treat a completed plan as the current product contract. Follow the existing timestamped plan-directory convention when a task needs a plan.
- Use focused conventional commits without AI attribution when committing is in scope. Review the staged content for secrets and unrelated changes before pushing; use `gh` for GitHub operations.
- Report what changed, which checks actually ran, and material remaining limits. Do not claim universal browser support, provider success, export parity, or an audit-clean dependency tree without evidence.
