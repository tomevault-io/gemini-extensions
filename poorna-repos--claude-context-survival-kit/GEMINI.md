# CLAUDE.md — Context OS

A portable `CLAUDE.md` that writes structured state to disk instead of trusting conversation memory, so context survives compaction. ~3.5K tokens for the core rules; the heavier templates load on demand. It depends on nothing but the filesystem — drop it in your repo root and adjust the `docs/summaries/` path.

## What summarization loses

Claude's default compaction loses five specific things, every time:

1. **Precise numbers** get rounded or dropped.
2. **Conditional logic** (IF / BUT / EXCEPT) collapses into a flat statement.
3. **Decision rationale** — the WHY evaporates; only the WHAT survives.
4. **Cross-document relationships** flatten.
5. **Open questions** get silently resolved as settled.

Asking Claude to "summarize" just triggers the same compression. So the fix isn't better summarization — it is **structured templates with explicit fields that mechanically prevent these five failures.** Each field below exists to stop one of them.

## The six rules

1. **Write state to disk, not conversation.** This is the one that matters most; the other five enforce it.
2. **Compact manually at 60–70%** of the context window — checkpoint on your terms before the harness auto-compacts on its own, and write state to disk first.
3. **Preserve exact values.** Never approximate numbers, never make requirements vague, never drop a decision or its rationale.
4. **Hand off** at session end, before switching tasks, and before any compaction.
5. **Never bulk-read documents.** One at a time: read, summarize to disk, release from context before the next.
6. **Never auto-resume** after a compaction. Read the handoff back, confirm, then continue.

## Core principle: write state to disk

**Conversations are ephemeral; disk is not.** After any meaningful work, write the load-bearing facts to a file rather than trusting them to survive in context. Anything you would lose if the session ended right now — exact numbers, decisions and their rationale, conditional logic, open questions, the next concrete step — belongs on disk the moment it matters, not at the end.

---

## Session handoffs

Write a handoff at the end of a working session, before switching tasks, and before any compaction. Save it to `docs/summaries/handoff-[YYYY-MM-DD]-[topic].md`. The schema forces the high-value facts to be copied verbatim rather than paraphrased; a handoff missing any section is non-compliant.

```markdown
# Handoff — [YYYY-MM-DD] — [topic]

## State
One paragraph. Where the work stands right now.

## Numbers (EXACT)
- Every number from this session: budgets, deadlines, counts, versions, dates. No rounding.

## Decisions
| Decision | Rationale (the WHY) | When |
|---|---|---|
| ... | ... | ... |

## Conditional logic
- Any IF / BUT / EXCEPT that governs the work. Keep the branches; don't flatten them.

## Open questions
- OPEN: ...
- ASSUMED: ... (what you assumed, and why)

## Files
- Touched: path — what changed
- Load next: the files the next session should open first
- Do NOT re-read: files already summarized above — their content is captured here

## Next action
The exact first thing to do next session. One unambiguous sentence.
```

**The "Do NOT re-read" field is load-bearing, not decorative.** On resume, Claude's instinct is to reload every file the last session touched — which is the single biggest context waste after a compaction. This field tells the next session which files are already distilled into the handoff so it spends tokens on work, not on re-reading what it already knows. (Exception: if a do-not-re-read file may have changed since, re-read it — the list assumes the file is unchanged.)

**Archive rotation:** after writing a new handoff, move the previous one to `docs/archive/handoffs/`. Only the latest stays in `docs/summaries/`.

---

## Manual compaction workflow

Don't let the harness auto-compact at ~95% (a lossy summary you don't control). Checkpoint earlier, on your terms.

**Detection.** Watch your context gauge. When it reaches **60–70% of the window**, cross the checkpoint threshold. If your statusline shows usage (e.g. `Ctx: <N>k`), use that; otherwise use a softer signal — if recent turns produced large outputs and you haven't checkpointed this session, checkpoint anyway. A false checkpoint costs one extra handoff file; a missed one costs lossy recovery.

> Claude Code exposes no context-token API, so detection is best-effort. The harness auto-compact is the safety floor underneath this workflow.

**Checkpoint procedure.**
1. Stop at a safe boundary — finish the current file write, don't abandon a partial edit.
2. Announce: "Context at ~[N]%. Writing pre-compaction handoff before compacting."
3. Write the full handoff to `docs/summaries/handoff-[YYYY-MM-DD]-precompact.md`. All exact-value rules apply; the **Next action** line is mandatory and unambiguous.
4. Tell the user: "Handoff saved at `<path>`. Run `/compact` when ready. After compaction I'll read it back and confirm before resuming."

**After compaction.** On the first turn: read the handoff in full from disk (canonical, not the inlined summary). **Do not auto-resume** — show a two-line state summary plus the literal **Next action**, then ask "Resume from this, or change direction?" and wait.

## Document processing

- Short (≤3 docs, <2K words each): read, write a summary to `docs/summaries/source-[filename].md`, then work from the summaries.
- Large/long (4+ docs OR >2K words): list them, process one at a time — read, summarize, release from context before the next. Bulk-reading floods the window and triggers the compaction you're trying to avoid.

---

## Subagent output contracts

When a subagent returns free-form prose, you get the same compression loss at the subagent boundary. Require a structured return contract instead. Example for a research subagent:

```markdown
## Findings
- <claim> — source: <path or URL>
## Open questions
- ...
## Recommended next step
- one sentence
```

Define the contract in the subagent's prompt. Structured returns survive being folded back into the main context; prose paraphrases don't.

---

## Error recovery

- **No handoff at compaction time.** Don't reconstruct from memory. Tell the user no handoff was written and ask them to state briefly where you left off.
- **Unexpected auto-compact.** Write `docs/summaries/recovery-[YYYY-MM-DD].md` with current state, say what may have been lost, and suggest a fresh session.

---

## Why this works

A summary is lossy compression; a structured handoff is closer to lossless, because the schema forces the exact numbers, the rationale, and the conditional logic to be copied rather than reworded.

It is also cheaper. By message 30 of a long session, each exchange can carry ~50K tokens of accumulated history. A fresh session resuming from a handoff starts around ~5K — roughly **10× less per message** — with none of the precision lost. Treating Claude as a stateless layer over a durable store is the same pattern a web server uses over a database: the context window is RAM, disk is the source of truth. Restarting is cheap when the truth never lived only in RAM.
