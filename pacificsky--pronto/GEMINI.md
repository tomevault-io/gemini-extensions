# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

Pronto is a native macOS menu-bar app (SwiftUI `MenuBarExtra`, no Dock icon) that
turns a La Marzocco espresso machine (Linea Micra / Mini / GS3) on and off via the
La Marzocco **cloud** API. Bundle id `blog.pacificsky.pronto`. Released on GitHub as
an **unofficial** app (keep the trademark disclaimer in README intact).

## Build & run

```sh
./make-app.sh              # builds dist/Pronto.app (release), code-signs it
open dist/Pronto.app
swift build                # plain build; does NOT assemble the .app bundle
swift build -c release     # what make-app.sh wraps
```

`make-app.sh` is the real build entry point — `swift build` alone produces a bare
binary with no `Info.plist` (so no `LSUIElement`, no menu-bar behavior). The only
tests are `Tests/ProntoTests` (the Sentry scrubber's privacy guarantee); no linter
is configured. CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs `swift build` + `swift test` on
`macos-15` after selecting the newest installed Xcode (the SDK must match the macOS
14 deployment target — some APIs like `openSettings` are 14.0).

## Code signing (important — affects Keychain prompts)

The signing identity controls whether stored credentials survive rebuilds:

- **Local dev (default):** `SIGN_IDENTITY="Pronto Local Signing"`. `make-app.sh`
  creates/reuses a self-signed identity. A *stable* signature keeps the Keychain
  ACL valid across rebuilds, so the app stops re-prompting for saved credentials.
  Prefer this when iterating. First build prompts twice: a macOS trust-password
  dialog, then a codesign keychain-access prompt — click **"Always Allow"** on the
  latter or it re-prompts every build (it seeds the key's partition list).
- **CI / release:** the release workflow imports an **Apple Developer ID Application**
  cert and builds with `SIGN_IDENTITY="Developer ID Application: …"`, which makes
  `make-app.sh` add `--options runtime --timestamp` (hardened runtime + secure
  timestamp — both required to notarize). The bundle is then notarized (`notarytool
  submit --wait`, App Store Connect API key) and the ticket **stapled** in. Result:
  no Gatekeeper warning and a *stable* identity across releases (no post-update
  Keychain re-prompt). Only a `Developer ID …` identity triggers those extra codesign
  options; ad-hoc (`-`) and the local self-signed cert don't (they stay offline).

`ensure_identity()` in `make-app.sh` imports the key + cert as **separate PEM
items**, NOT a PKCS#12 bundle — macOS's `security import` rejects OpenSSL 3's
default p12 (SHA-256 MAC / AES-256 bags / empty password), which silently drops
the private key and leaves an orphan cert. Don't switch it back to PKCS#12.

## Releases

Push a `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` tag; `.github/workflows/release.yml` builds, signs with
Developer ID, notarizes + staples, zips, and publishes a GitHub Release. The version
comes from the tag via `APP_VERSION="<tag without v>"`. Signing/notarization is gated
on repo secrets (`DEVELOPER_ID_CERT_P12_BASE64` + password, `NOTARY_API_KEY_P8_BASE64`
+ `NOTARY_API_KEY_ID`/`NOTARY_API_ISSUER_ID`); if the cert secret is unset the release
**fails** (a release must be signed). See RELEASE.md. Apple's notary can occasionally
backlog for 40–60+ min (the CI step retries transient errors but caps at 60 min); when
it won't clear in time, notarize by hand with `notarize-local.sh` (same signing path via
`make-app.sh`, uncapped poll). See RELEASE.md.

`make-app.sh` also emits `dist/Pronto.dSYM` (via `dsymutil` — the plain
`swift build -c release` already carries a debug map, no `-g` needed) keyed by the
binary's `LC_UUID`, which code-signing leaves unchanged. The release workflow uploads
it to Sentry with `sentry-cli debug-files upload --include-sources` so crash reports
symbolicate. That step is gated on a `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` secret (write-scoped; the
DSN, by contrast, is public) with `SENTRY_ORG`/`SENTRY_PROJECT` repo *variables* — if
the token is unset the upload is skipped and the release still publishes. The dSYM
lives beside the bundle, not inside it, so it's never in the user zip.

The workflow also creates + finalizes a **Sentry release** named after the version
(the tag) and associates commits (`sentry-cli releases new/set-commits/finalize`),
so events group by version with suspect-commit detection. This only works because the
app tags events with the *same* name — `CrashReporting` sets `options.releaseName` to
`CFBundleShortVersionString` — so keep those two in sync. Commit association uses
`set-commits --auto` (Sentry's GitHub integration must have the repo added; the
workflow's `fetch-depth: 0` checkout supplies the current SHA) and is best-effort: a
failure there warns but doesn't fail the publish.

## Architecture

Single executable target, `Sources/Pronto`, `@main` is `ProntoApp`. UI is driven
by one `@MainActor` view-model.

- **`ProntoApp.swift`** — `MenuBarExtra` + `Settings` scenes; accessory activation.
  The menu-bar icon reflects the selected machine's power via *distinct glyphs*
  (filled cup = on, `powersleep` = standby, outline cup = unknown, outline cup +
  exclamation badge = machine offline — a hand-composed template image, since no
  such SF Symbol exists) — **not** color, which the menu bar templates away to
  monochrome.
- **`MachineController.swift`** — the brain. `@MainActor @Observable` view-model
  (the Observation framework, not `ObservableObject`) owning `ConnectionState`, the
  machine list, and the live device. It keeps a shared `LaMarzoccoCloudClient` (an
  `actor`) for auth + the machine list, and one `AngstromUI.LaMarzoccoMachine`
  (`device`) for the **selected** serial — rebuilt on selection change. `power` is a
  computed read of `device.powerState`, so SwiftUI tracks the nested `@Observable`
  and the menu bar updates live. Status comes from the **websocket**, not polling:
  `activateMachine()` does one `refreshDashboard()` (a dashboard must exist before
  `start()` or identity-less pushes are dropped) then `start()`, which self-heals on
  reconnect. Power commands go through `device.setPower`, which (with the socket up)
  **awaits the machine's confirmation frame** and throws `commandTimedOut` /
  `commandFailed` — no more hand-rolled confirmation poll. `pendingTarget` drives the
  in-flight spinner. Transient refresh errors are swallowed to keep last-known state;
  only `LaMarzoccoError.authenticationFailed` downgrades the connection. The
  connection is owned by `MachineController.shared` and brought up at **launch** from
  `AppDelegate.applicationDidFinishLaunching` — its lifetime is the app's, not the
  popover's. `isMachineOffline` (the dashboard envelope's `connected` flag, via
  `dashboard.machine.isConnected`) reports the **machine's own** link to LM's cloud —
  orthogonal to our socket health: when the machine is physically off / unplugged /
  off Wi-Fi, the cloud serves a husk dashboard (`connected: false`, widgets reduced
  to a frozen `CMMachineStatus`), so the mode-derived `power` is last-known, not
  live. The UI shows "Machine offline" instead of trusting it and suppresses the
  power button (`setPower` also guards).
- **Verifying the live socket.** It does **not** show up in `lsof -iTCP`: the cloud
  host is behind CloudFront and the connection rides QUIC / Network.framework, not a
  classic TCP socket FD — so `lsof` is a false negative, not a bug. To confirm it's
  live, use the in-app **Live** badge in the popover footer (`controller.isLive`),
  watch `nettop -p "$(pgrep -x Pronto)"` for the ~15s STOMP heartbeat ticking up
  `bytes_out`, or stream the logs: the client log handler + lifecycle events go to
  `os.Logger` under subsystem `blog.pacificsky.pronto`
  (`log stream --predicate 'subsystem == "blog.pacificsky.pronto"'`, or Console.app
  with *Include Info Messages* on).
- **The cloud client + crypto live in the [Angstrom](https://github.com/pacificsky/angstrom)
  package** (dependency `from: "1.0.0"`, pinned in `Package.resolved`), not in this
  repo. It owns the REST flow (register → sign in → per-request-signed calls), the
  auth crypto (`InstallationKey`, P-256 proof — verified byte-for-byte against
  `pylamarzocco` in Angstrom's own tests), and the `Machine` / `PowerState` /
  `DeviceType` / `LaMarzoccoError` models. Don't reimplement any of this in Pronto.
  Protocol-level changes (new endpoints, device types, status parsing) belong in
  Angstrom + a version bump, not here. Pronto consumes **two** products from the
  package: `Angstrom` (the stateless actor + models) and `AngstromUI` (the
  `@MainActor @Observable` `LaMarzoccoMachine` device layer that merges websocket
  pushes into a `dashboard` and applies optimistic command updates).
- **`Persistence.swift`** — Pronto owns all persistence (Angstrom does none). Secrets
  (username, password, the `Codable` `InstallationKey`) are stored as a *single*
  consolidated Keychain item (service = bundle id), read once and cached, to minimize
  Keychain prompts. The `isRegistered` flag and other non-secret prefs live in
  UserDefaults. The stored key + flag are passed back into the client on launch.
- **`CrashReporting.swift` / `SensitiveDataScrubber.swift`** — opt-in crash
  reporting via Sentry (dependency `sentry-cocoa`), wired so **no user-private data
  ever leaves the device**. Three layers: (1) start `SentrySDK` only when the user
  opts in (Settings toggle, defaults **off**, persisted in UserDefaults) *and* a DSN
  is baked into the bundle — `make-app.sh` writes `SentryDSN` from the `SENTRY_DSN`
  env var (a repo secret in release CI), so dev builds ship empty → Sentry never
  initializes; (2) the `SentryOptions` disable every collector that gathers private
  data (network breadcrumbs / tracking / failed-request capture all carry the
  serial-bearing LM URLs; swizzling off); (3) `beforeSend`/`beforeBreadcrumb` route
  everything through `SensitiveDataScrubber`, which redacts the account email and
  machine serials/names by both registered literal (fed from `MachineController`) and
  regex pattern, and drops `user`/`request`/`serverName`. The guarantee is proven by
  `Tests/ProntoTests` (the repo's only test target; CI runs `swift test`), which seeds
  an event with private data in every field and asserts none survives. Never set a
  Sentry user or put secrets in log/error/breadcrumb messages.
- **`MenuContentView.swift` / `SettingsView.swift` / `MachineSettingsView.swift`**
  — the popover (status + a single state-aware power button) and the Settings
  window (Account / Machine / Privacy tabs). The Machine tab holds live boiler
  settings: brew target temperature (machine-reported min/max/step, °C with °F
  hint, debounced ~1s in the controller so stepping sends one command), steam
  on/off, and steam level 1/2/3 (`steamBoilerLevel` machines only; GS3-family
  gets the toggle, grinders neither). `MachineSettingsForm` is value-driven so
  every state renders offline (`RENDER_MOCKS=1 swift test --filter
  MachineSettingsRenderTests`). The power button shows the one available action —
  its label/colour/action follow the current state (`Turn On` sage / `Turn Off`
  amber / disabled while a command reconciles); current state itself is conveyed
  by the header dot + status line + the menu-bar glyph, plus a **Live** badge in
  the header when the websocket subscription is active. Devices where
  `Machine.supportsPower == false` (grinders) render **status-only**: the button
  is replaced by a note and `setPower` is guarded. Views observe the controller
  via `@Environment(MachineController.self)` (Observation, not
  `@EnvironmentObject`). The live connection is brought up at **launch** (see
  `AppDelegate`), so the menu-bar icon shows `.unknown` only until the first
  status arrives; after that the websocket keeps it current.

## Constraints & scope

- macOS 14+ deployment target. Developed on a newer Swift/Xcode; keep new API use
  guarded to 14.0 or CI will break.
- Cloud-only: the old local LAN HTTP API (port 8081) is gone on current firmware;
  Bluetooth LE is out of scope. Don't reintroduce a local-HTTP path.
- Scope is power on/off, live status, and boiler settings (brew temperature,
  steam on/off, steam level on machines that support it — Settings › Machine
  tab) — schedules are intentionally excluded. Grinders (Pico/Swan) are
  **status-only**:
  La Marzocco's cloud has no grinder power command, so they show state but no
  controls.
- End-to-end testing needs real La Marzocco account credentials (entered in
  Settings); it is not exercised by the build pipeline.
