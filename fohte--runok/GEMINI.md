> When a change would push a file's non-test code past ~500 lines, split it along responsibility seams before adding more. Splits must be move-only commits: no logic changes, renames, or reformatting mixed in. Keep external import paths unchanged by keeping the entrypoint file in place and re-exporting the pieces you split out into new files (e.g. `foo.rs` gains a `foo/` directory for its submodules, `index.ts` re-exports from the new files). Tests move together with the code they verify.

## Code organization rules

### Split files before they grow past ~500 lines of production code

When a change would push a file's non-test code past ~500 lines, split it along responsibility seams before adding more. Splits must be move-only commits: no logic changes, renames, or reformatting mixed in. Keep external import paths unchanged by keeping the entrypoint file in place and re-exporting the pieces you split out into new files (e.g. `foo.rs` gains a `foo/` directory for its submodules, `index.ts` re-exports from the new files). Tests move together with the code they verify.

Prefer creating a new focused file over appending to the largest existing one.

## Error handling rules

### Return a `Result` instead of throwing

`errorHandling` in `eslint.config.js` bans `throw`/`try-catch` in production code and requires every returned `Result` to be consumed (`no-restricted-syntax`, `neverthrow/must-use-result` in `@fohte/eslint-config`). Return a `Result`/`ResultAsync` from [neverthrow](https://github.com/supermacro/neverthrow) instead:

```ts
// bad: throws
function parseConfig(raw: string): Config {
  if (!isValid(raw)) throw new Error('invalid config')
  return JSON.parse(raw)
}

// good: returns a Result
function parseConfig(raw: string): Result<Config, ConfigError> {
  if (!isValid(raw)) return err(new ConfigError('invalid config'))
  return ok(JSON.parse(raw))
}
```

Use `ResultAsync.fromPromise()` or `Result.fromThrowable()` to interop with a throwing API without a local try/catch. If the throw-based contract genuinely can't be wrapped that way, catch the exception, wrap it in a `BoundaryError` subclass (see `src/errors.ts`), and rethrow it — `no-restricted-syntax` bans `try`/`throw` as separate selectors, so both the `try` and the `throw` need their own `eslint-disable-next-line no-restricted-syntax` comment explaining why.

## Test code rules

### Assert on the whole output with a single equality check

Treat each test as a spec: build the expected output as one literal value (object, struct, JSON, array, etc.) and compare it to the actual output with a single equality assertion. Do not split the assertion into per-field checks, and do not use partial matchers (substring contains, `toContain`, `toMatchObject`, prefix/suffix checks, regex-on-substring, etc.). Partial matches silently ignore unexpected fields and extra elements, so the test stops working as a spec the moment the shape of the output changes.

```ts
// bad: picks fields one by one — silent on any new/changed field
const ev = run()
expect(ev.path).toBe('/a')
expect(ev.event).toBe('ok')
expect(ev.message).toContain('done')

// good: one literal, one equality — any drift in shape fails the test
expect(run()).toEqual({
  path: '/a',
  event: 'ok',
  message: 'done',
})
```

```rust
// bad
let ev = run();
assert_eq!(ev["path"], "/a");
assert_eq!(ev["event"], "ok");
assert!(ev["message"].as_str().unwrap().contains("done"));

// good
assert_eq!(
    run(),
    json!({
        "path": "/a",
        "event": "ok",
        "message": "done",
    }),
);
```

For dynamic fields (timestamps, UUIDs, random IDs), normalize them in a helper before the comparison (e.g. replace with a fixed placeholder) so the full output can still be asserted in one equality check. Do not weaken the assertion to dodge the dynamic value.

The `no-assert-contains` ast-grep rule rejects `assert!(x.contains(...))` at the expression level; this guideline is the broader principle that the rule is one instance of.

### Parameterize similar test cases with rstest

Do not write multiple test functions that differ only in input/expected values. Use `#[rstest]` with `#[case]`.

```rust
// bad: separate functions per case
#[test]
fn test_parse_empty() { assert_eq!(parse(""), None); }
#[test]
fn test_parse_valid() { assert_eq!(parse("hello"), Some("hello")); }

// good: parameterized
#[rstest]
#[case::empty("", None)]
#[case::valid("hello", Some("hello"))]
fn test_parse(#[case] input: &str, #[case] expected: Option<&str>) {
    assert_eq!(parse(input), expected);
}
```

### Always name `#[case]` variants

Use `#[case::descriptive_name(...)]`, not bare `#[case(...)]`. Named cases identify failures without inspecting values.

### Use `#[fixture]` for shared test setup

Do not repeat the same setup code across tests. Extract into `#[fixture]`.

```rust
// bad: duplicated setup
#[rstest]
fn test_a() { let repo = make_repo(); /* ... */ }
#[rstest]
fn test_b() { let repo = make_repo(); /* ... */ }

// good: fixture injection
#[fixture]
fn repo() -> Repo { make_repo() }
#[rstest]
fn test_a(repo: Repo) { /* ... */ }
```

### Use `indoc!` for multiline string literals in tests

Do not embed `\n` in string literals. Use `indoc!` for readability.

### Extract repeated assertions into helper functions

If the same assertion chain appears in 3+ tests, extract it into a helper.

### Do not write tests that only verify test helpers

Tests must verify production code. Tests that only assert on test helpers, fixtures, or mocks are unnecessary. Remove them.

### Integration tests for rule evaluation logic

Write integration tests in `tests/integration/`. Integration tests verify the end-to-end path: YAML config -> `parse_config` -> `evaluate_command`/`evaluate_compound`. Unit tests focus on internal algorithm correctness (pattern matching, command parsing, expression evaluation). Both may exercise the same code paths from different perspectives (ripgrep-style test separation).

## Documentation rules

### Keep docs and README up to date

When adding, changing, or removing user-facing features, CLI options, configuration fields, or behavior, update the relevant documentation:

- **README.md** -- Update if the change affects the project overview, feature list, or getting-started instructions.
- **docs/ (Starlight site)** -- Update the corresponding page(s) under `docs/src/content/docs/`. Common areas:
  - CLI changes: `cli/`
  - Configuration changes: `configuration/`
  - Pattern syntax changes: `pattern-syntax/`
  - Rule evaluation changes: `rule-evaluation/`
  - Sandbox changes: `sandbox/`

Do not create new doc pages unless the change introduces an entirely new concept. Prefer updating existing pages first.

### Add release notes for user-facing changes

When a PR introduces user-facing changes (new features, bug fixes, breaking changes, behavioral changes, new CLI options, etc.), add an entry to `docs/src/content/docs/releases/next.md`. This file tracks unreleased changes.

**When to add:** Any PR that changes user-visible behavior. Skip for purely internal changes (CI config, dev tooling, refactors with no behavior change, dependency bumps with no user impact).

**Format:** Follow the style of existing release notes (e.g., `docs/src/content/docs/releases/v0-2-0.md`):

- Use `## Highlights` for major/breaking changes, `## New Features` for additions, `## Bug Fixes` for fixes.
- Each entry is a `###` heading with a short description and a PR link: `### Feature name ([#123](https://github.com/fohte/runok/pull/123))`.
- Include a brief explanation and a code example when helpful.
- Link to relevant doc pages with `See [Page Name](/path/) for details.` when applicable.

**If `next.md` already has entries**, append to the appropriate section. If it still has the placeholder text `No unreleased changes yet.`, replace it with the new entry.

**PR link is required.** The PR link in the `###` heading is mandatory. If the PR number is not yet known when editing `next.md`, leave a `TODO(pr-link)` placeholder and replace it in a follow-up commit (after `gh pr create` returns the number) before the PR is merged. Entries without PR links must not be merged.

## Code rules

### Use the `shlex` crate for shell quoting and splitting

Use `shlex::try_join`, `shlex::try_quote`, and `shlex::split` for shell quoting and command splitting. Do not implement custom shell quoting or whitespace-based command splitting.
