Operational invariants that are easy to regress on a manual edit and are
enforced by tests. Keep this in sync with the code it references.

## Eval job network isolation (base_jobs_internal)

The agent-challenge runs miner eval jobs as short-lived Docker Swarm
replicated-jobs dispatched by the broker (`base-docker-broker`). The miner's
**untrusted agent code runs INSIDE that job container**, so whatever network the
job joins, the miner code can reach. The job legitimately needs to reach exactly
TWO swarm services by name:

- `challenge-agent-challenge:8000` — the agent-challenge API, for real-time trial
  log streaming (`CHALLENGE_TERMINAL_BENCH_LOG_STREAM_URL` /
  `AGENT_CHALLENGE_INTERNAL_BASE_URL`).
- `base-master-proxy` — the master LLM gateway, for the agent's gated LLM calls
  (`CHALLENGE_LLM_GATEWAY_BASE_URL`).

### The topology (baked into code; never needs a manual `docker service update`)

- A dedicated overlay **`base_jobs_internal`** is created `--internal` (NO
  internet egress) and `--attachable`
  (`deploy/swarm/install-swarm.sh` `create_networks` /
  `swarm_backend.DEFAULT_JOB_NETWORK`).
- The eval **JOB** runs on `base_jobs_internal`
  (`CHALLENGE_DOCKER_BROKER_NETWORK=base_jobs_internal`, set by
  `cli_app/main.py::AGENT_CHALLENGE_JOB_NETWORK`, which reuses
  `swarm_backend.DEFAULT_JOB_NETWORK` as the single source of truth).
- The agent-challenge **API + worker** AND the **master proxy** are ATTACHED to
  `base_jobs_internal` in ADDITION to `base_challenges`, so the job can resolve /
  reach ONLY those by name.

### Why (security)

- The job reaches the API (logs) + proxy (LLM gateway), but **NOT**
  `base-master-postgres` (postgres lives on `base_challenges`, which the job is
  NOT on), and has **no direct internet** (the overlay is `--internal`). The
  agent's LLM traffic therefore goes only through the master gateway.
- Putting the job on `base_challenges` would work for DNS but would also expose
  postgres:5432 to miner code — NOT acceptable. Putting it on the default bridge
  fails DNS for swarm service names (the live breakage this fixes).

### Where it is wired

| Concern | Code |
|---------|------|
| Job network constant | `src/base/cli_app/main.py::AGENT_CHALLENGE_JOB_NETWORK` (= `swarm_backend.DEFAULT_JOB_NETWORK` = `base_jobs_internal`) |
| Multi-network service plan | `swarm_backend.SwarmServicePlan.extra_networks` → one `--network` per network in `build_service_create_argv` |
| API/worker multi-home (dynamic) | `SwarmChallengeOrchestrator(job_network_slugs={"agent-challenge"})`; `_challenge_plan` sets `extra_networks` and `start_challenge` ensures the internal overlay exists |
| API/worker multi-home (static) | `install-swarm.sh` `CHALLENGE_EXTRA_NETWORKS=("${NET_JOBS_INTERNAL}")` on the agent-challenge api + worker |
| Proxy multi-home | `install-swarm.sh` `_deploy_master_service` adds a second `--network "${NET_JOBS_INTERNAL}"` for the proxy only |
| Network creation | `install-swarm.sh` `create_networks` / `_create_overlay "${NET_JOBS_INTERNAL}" true` (internal) |

### Do NOT change

- The broker (`base-docker-broker`) is **not** on `base_jobs_internal` — only the
  proxy serves the gateway. Adding the broker would be unnecessary surface.
- **terminal-bench TASK containers** (where `git clone` / installs happen) are
  launched separately on the host docker daemon with per-task `allow_internet`
  (default-bridge public egress). Their networking MUST stay unrestricted public
  egress — this isolation is about the JOB orchestrator container ONLY.
- prism services are **not** multi-homed onto `base_jobs_internal`: the prism eval
  job is egress-locked by the broker pinning the JOB to the internal overlay
  (`broker_egress_locked_slugs`), not by multi-homing the long-lived prism
  service.

Tests: `tests/unit/test_swarm_backend.py` (multi-network argv + orchestrator
multi-homing), `tests/unit/test_seed_docker_backend.py` (job network constant +
LOG_STREAM host == service name), `tests/unit/test_client_service_cli_config.py`,
`tests/unit/test_install_swarm_decentralized_deploy.py` (proxy + api/worker
attach).

## Master registry-driven challenge deploy (reconciler)

The master (`base master proxy`) runs a background **registry reconcile loop**
that turns the challenge registry into running challenge services. This is what
makes installing `base` (master) auto-deploy every ACTIVE challenge, and makes a
newly-registered ACTIVE challenge propagate automatically with NO static
per-challenge `docker service create` step. (Historically the master had no such
loop: `SwarmChallengeOrchestrator` only did per-spec start/stop/restart, admin
create just wrote a DB row, and the only reconcile was the legacy validator-side
`NormalValidatorRunner.run_once`. The `install-swarm.sh` `deploy_challenges`
default-path comment now reflects this real behavior.)

### Behavior (idempotent, reconcile-to-registry)

- Each pass reads `registry.list(active_only=True)` and calls
  `orchestrator.start_challenge(spec)` for every ACTIVE challenge with no running
  service. Start is invoked **exactly once per challenge** (the reconciler tracks
  what it has deployed), and `start_challenge` is itself idempotent (it reuses an
  existing service).
- **Cross-restart self-heal:** the managed set the reconciler tears down from is
  the challenge services ACTUALLY running (discovered from the backend via
  `orchestrator.list_running_challenge_slugs()` — swarm services named
  `challenge-<slug>` labelled `base.component=challenge`) **UNIONED** with this
  process's in-memory `_deployed` set. So a service a PRIOR process created for a
  challenge that is no longer ACTIVE is stopped even though this process never had
  that slug in `_deployed` (closes the live-observed orphan gap where a
  deactivated `challenge-regtest` kept running after a proxy restart). An ACTIVE
  challenge whose service is already running is **adopted** (tracked, start NOT
  called again — a healthy service is never recreated).
- A challenge whose status is no longer ACTIVE (DRAFT / INACTIVE / DISABLED, or
  removed from the registry) has its service **stopped** via
  `orchestrator.stop_challenge(slug)` on the next pass.
- DRAFT / INACTIVE / DISABLED challenges are **never** started (belt-and-suspenders:
  the reconciler also re-filters to ACTIVE even if a registry ignores
  `active_only`).
- Each pass emits an INFO-level summary (`adopted`/`started`/`stopped` slugs) so
  the loop's activity is observable in the proxy logs (it was previously silent
  except on exceptions). A start/stop that raises is logged and retried next pass;
  service discovery that raises degrades to the in-memory `_deployed` set; one
  failure never aborts the whole pass or stops the loop.

### Where it is wired

| Concern | Code |
|---------|------|
| Reconciler + loop + lifespan | `src/base/master/orchestration.py::MasterChallengeReconciler` / `run_registry_reconcile_loop` / `build_master_registry_reconcile_lifespan` |
| Shared spec builder (same shape as the legacy runner) | `src/base/master/docker_orchestrator.py::challenge_spec_from_registry` (also used by `validator/normal_runner.py`); emits `workload_class="service"` |
| Cadence / opt-out | `MasterSettings.registry_reconcile_interval_seconds` (default `60.0`; `<=0` disables — default-on for the master) |
| Wire-up | `master/app_proxy.py::create_proxy_app` (`registry_reconciler` + `registry_reconcile_interval_seconds`, composed via `_combine_lifespans`); constructed in `cli_app/main.py::master_proxy` from the same `orchestrator` the runtime controller uses |

Tests: `tests/unit/test_master_registry_reconciler.py` (faked registry +
orchestrator: start/idempotent/add/deactivate/remove/reactivate, non-ACTIVE never
started, spec parity, start-failure retry, async registry, loop + lifespan,
cross-restart self-heal of an orphaned service from an EMPTY in-memory set,
adopt-not-restart of an already-running ACTIVE service, INFO summary log,
discovery-failure degradation); orchestrator discovery accessor in
`tests/unit/test_swarm_backend.py` + `tests/unit/test_docker_orchestrator_extended.py`.

### Challenge combined mode (single service = API + in-process worker; architecture.md sec 9.5)

The reconciler deploys exactly ONE `challenge-<slug>` service per ACTIVE
challenge, but both challenge images need TWO processes: the uvicorn API AND a
worker loop that is the only eval-queue drainer. **Combined mode** collapses them
so the API process ALSO runs the worker loop in-process; the single service both
serves and drains. It is opt-in per challenge and default-OFF (the legacy
`install-swarm.sh --static-challenges` two-service path is unchanged).

- The registry records the image's opt-in env var name in the **internal**
  metadata field `combined_mode_env` (NOT public — not in
  `PUBLIC_REGISTRY_METADATA_KEYS`). The seed sets it per slug: agent-challenge →
  `CHALLENGE_COMBINED_WORKER`, prism → `PRISM_COMBINED_MODE`. The old
  `metadata.worker_command` seeding is retired (and popped on re-seed).
- **Both** single-service spec builders inject `env.setdefault(<combined_mode_env>,
  "true")` and no longer read `worker_command`, so the single service runs the
  image default CMD (uvicorn API) with the worker in-process:
  `docker_orchestrator.challenge_spec_from_registry` (reconciler + `NormalValidatorRunner`)
  and `cli_app/main.py::DockerRuntimeController._spec` (admin pull/restart/status).
- The single service **must also carry the docker/broker URL + token env** the
  worker needs (the seed already sets `*_DOCKER_BROKER_URL` + `*_DOCKER_BROKER_TOKEN_FILE`
  for both slugs); prism additionally reads the LLM gateway token from
  `/run/secrets/base_gateway_token` by config default. prism needs NO GPU pinning
  (the worker orchestrates GPU work via the broker; host-side scoring is CPU-only).
- `ChallengeSpec.worker_command` + the `swarm_backend`/`docker_orchestrator` command
  plumbing are KEPT as a generic, slug-agnostic override seam (unused by the
  registry path). `combined_mode_env_from_metadata()` reads/validates the name.

Tests: `tests/unit/test_master_registry_reconciler.py` (combined-env injected +
broker env + no `-worker` service), `tests/unit/test_docker_orchestrator_extended.py`
(`combined_mode_env_from_metadata` validation + spec builder), `tests/unit/test_swarm_backend.py`
(combined service renders `--env` with image default CMD), `tests/unit/test_client_service_cli_config.py`
(seed sets `combined_mode_env` per slug, drops `worker_command`).

## Per-validator on-chain weight submission (architecture.md sec 9.3)

The weights model is **single master aggregation + per-validator submission**:
the MASTER aggregates the canonical weight vector and serves it at
`GET /v1/weights/latest`; **every validator fetches that SAME vector and commits
it on-chain under its OWN wallet/hotkey.** Validators do NOT compute or aggregate
their own vector - aggregation lives entirely on the master
(`base.master.aggregator` / `MasterWeightService`). This is the legacy
`submit_latest_weights` relay pattern, run per-validator instead of from a single
global submitter.

### Behavior (per-validator, independent, idempotent, gated)

- **Runs in the validator runtime.** `base validator agent`
  (`cli_app/main.py::validator_agent` → `_run_validator_agent_runtime`) runs the
  agent loop AND this node's OWN weight-submit loop concurrently, so every
  validator node that runs the agent also submits its own weights. There is no
  single global submitter assumption.
- **Own keypair.** The submitter's `WeightSetter` is built lazily from THIS
  node's wallet (`create_bittensor_submit_runtime(settings).weight_setter`), so
  each validator commits under its own hotkey.
- **No validator-side aggregation.** The vector always comes from the master via
  `WeightsClient.fetch_latest()` (`/v1/weights/latest`); the validator submit
  module imports NO `base.master.*` aggregation.
- **Independent, no shared state.** Each `ValidatorWeightSubmitter` holds its own
  in-memory idempotency marker; concurrent validators share nothing.
- **Idempotent / crash-re-run safe.** The master stamps each computed vector with
  `computed_at`; the submitter tracks the last vector it committed and re-running
  over an unchanged vector is a no-op (`ALREADY_SUBMITTED`), so a running node
  never re-commits the same vector. Across a crash/restart the on-chain
  commit-reveal rate limit rejects a too-fast re-commit, surfaced as `REJECTED`
  (logged, retried next tick, never a silent success, never double-counted).
- **Gate-off no-op.** When `validator.submit_on_chain_enabled` is `False`
  (default) the tick does NO fetch, NO submit-runtime construction (no live
  `Subtensor`), and NO submission (`DISABLED`). Live enablement is human-gated.

### Where it is wired

| Concern | Code |
|---------|------|
| Per-validator submitter | `src/base/validator/weight_submitter.py::ValidatorWeightSubmitter` (+ `ValidatorSubmitOutcome`) |
| Shared master-vector validation | `src/base/validator/weights_client.py::validate_master_weights_payload` (also used by the legacy `NormalValidatorRunner`) |
| Runtime wire-up | `cli_app/main.py::_build_validator_weight_submitter` + `_run_validator_agent_runtime` (called by `validator_agent`) |
| Gate | `ValidatorSettings.submit_on_chain_enabled` (default `False`) |

Tests: `tests/unit/test_validator_weight_submitter.py` (fetch-master-vector +
own-keypair submit, two independent submitters with their own hotkeys, idempotent
re-run no-op, gate-off no-op, rejected-commit retry, no master-aggregation
import); `tests/unit/test_validator_agent_cli_docs.py` (gate default off, gate-on
enable, submit loop runs in the agent runtime).
