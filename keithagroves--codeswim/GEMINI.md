# Diagram-First Code Navigator (Electron app)

A standalone Electron desktop app for navigating a codebase as a hierarchy
of mermaid diagrams. The original of the idea — `codeswim-vscode`
is the same idea ported to a VS Code extension, and `codeswim-example`
is the demo content both target.

The thesis (from [plan.md](./plan.md)): as AI generates more code, humans
should navigate architecture through intentional diagrams, not by reading
generated implementation. Diagrams live as markdown files; this app makes
them clickable.

## Monorepo layout

This is an npm-workspaces + Turborepo monorepo. The Electron app lives in
`apps/desktop`; framework-free logic is extracted into `packages/*` and
consumed as TypeScript source — there is no per-package build step,
electron-vite bundles the workspace source directly:

- `@codeswim/contract` — IPC payload types + the `DiagramNavApi` surface;
  the versioned seam between main, preload, and renderer.
- `@codeswim/domain-git` / `-github` / `-kanban` / `-skills` — Electron-free
  domain logic. Electron-coupled pieces (auth secret storage, `shell.open`,
  the built-in skills dir) are *injected* by `apps/desktop/src/main` rather
  than imported, so the packages stay portable.
- `@codeswim/coverage` — the diagram/source drift checker.
- `@codeswim/commit` — prompt-commit synthesis + triage.
- `@codeswim/harness` — the opencode plugin, session gate, tools, and
  prompts that get bundled into `out/harness/`.

Run everything from the repo root: `npm run dev` / `build` / `typecheck` /
`test` delegate to the desktop app or fan out across packages via Turbo.

## Process layout

Standard Electron three-process app:

- **Main** ([apps/desktop/src/main/index.ts](apps/desktop/src/main/index.ts)) — owns the filesystem.
  Opens the folder picker, reads files, runs the chokidar watcher, spawns
  npm scripts via `child_process.spawn`, walks the directory tree. All IPC
  handlers (`pick-folder`, `read-file`, `list-markdown`, `list-tree`,
  `watch`/`unwatch`, `read-package-scripts`, `run-script`/`kill-script`)
  live here.

- **Preload** ([apps/desktop/src/preload/index.ts](apps/desktop/src/preload/index.ts) +
  [index.d.ts](apps/desktop/src/preload/index.d.ts)) — minimal `contextBridge`
  surface. Keeps `contextIsolation: true`, `nodeIntegration: false`.

- **Renderer** ([apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/App.tsx](apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/App.tsx)) — React app.
  Owns all UI state via reducer + context. Components consume `useStore()`.

The IPC contract lives in the `@codeswim/contract` package
([packages/contract/src/api.ts](packages/contract/src/api.ts)).
Treat it as a versioned interface — adding a method requires touching all
three processes.

## Renderer architecture

State is a single reducer in [state.tsx](apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/state.tsx),
exposed via context defined in [store.ts](apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/store.ts). The
two files are split so vite's fast-refresh works (only-components rule).

Views render diagrams or Markdown explanations; source code is never shown
inside Codeswim. The current implementation file is tracked as a relative
posix path (`currentFile`), while `currentDocumentPath` is the Markdown
document being rendered. Breadcrumbs are a stack; navigation pushes onto it,
"back" / clicking a crumb pops to that point.

Source links continue to target real files for coverage. The main process
resolves them to `.codeswim/explanations/<source-path>.md` (with adjacent
Markdown fallbacks). The header's "Open in editor" command opens the actual
source file through Electron.

Path resolution lives in [path-utils.ts](apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/path-utils.ts).
Renderer code never deals in absolute paths — it converts to absolute only
at the IPC boundary, so diagrams stay portable.

## Mermaid integration

[DiagramView.tsx](apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/components/DiagramView.tsx) initializes
mermaid with `securityLevel: 'loose'` (required for `click ... call
navigate(...)` to invoke `window.navigate`). Mermaid is rendered
imperatively via `mermaid.render()`; `startOnLoad` is off.

The webview-style CSP in `apps/desktop/src/renderer/index.html` needs
`'unsafe-eval'` in `script-src` for mermaid loose mode and inline styles
allowed for the SVG output. If you tighten CSP, verify mermaid still
renders before shipping — there are _two_ prior bugs of this exact shape.

## Markdown parser

[parse.ts](apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/parse.ts) extracts frontmatter (`name`,
`description`, `tags`) and mermaid blocks. It uses `js-yaml` rather than
`gray-matter` because gray-matter pulls in `Buffer` which Vite doesn't
polyfill cleanly.

The parser scans line-by-line (CommonMark-ish), handling 3+ backticks or
tildes and CRLF. **Don't replace it with a single regex** — the regex
version regressed twice. The shipped VS Code extension at
`codeswim-vscode` carries the same lesson in its CLAUDE.md.

## File watching

The chokidar watcher in main starts when the user picks a folder. It:

- Emits `file-changed` on every `.md` or non-`.md` change (renderer reloads
  if the changed file is currently displayed).
- Emits a debounced (200ms) `tree-changed` on add/unlink/addDir/unlinkDir
  so the file tree refreshes.
- Ignores `node_modules`, `dist`, `out`, `build`, `.git`, `.DS_Store` and
  most dotfiles (except `.env` and `.gitignore` which are visible).

Debouncing matters — editors do multi-step writes (rename + write) that
fire several events within ~50ms.

## Script runner

[ScriptControls](apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/components/ScriptControls.tsx) shows a
dropdown of npm scripts; clicking Run spawns via `npm run <name>` with
`shell: true, detached: true`. The detached flag matters: `npm` itself
spawns subcommands (e.g. `tsx`, `vitest`), and we kill the whole process
group with `process.kill(-pid, 'SIGTERM')` on Stop. Without `detached`,
npm dies but its children leak.

The script names come from package.json — they're validated against the
parsed scripts before spawning, then shell-quoted defensively.

## Test fixture

[examples/sample-architecture/overview.md](examples/sample-architecture/overview.md) is a
hand-authored fictional project ("Triage" billing app, unrelated to this
repo's architecture) used to develop against. It's a real codeswim-style
hierarchy: `overview.md` → architecture/ → flows/ → src/. Use it as the
reference for what diagram authors _should_ produce.

`codeswim-example` is a more elaborate version of the same
fixture with runnable code — point the navigator at it for end-to-end demos.

## Sandboxed environments

If `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1` is set in the environment, Electron runs as
plain Node and `require('electron')` returns the path string (not the
namespace), which crashes startup at `electron.app.isPackaged`. This
shows up in CI sandboxes. Unset it before `npm run dev`.

## Don't

- Don't add an in-app diagram editor. The plan is explicit: this is a
  read-only navigator. Authoring happens in the user's editor; we just
  watch and re-render.
- Don't introduce a markdown renderer for prose more elaborate than
  what's needed for the diagram-page meta block. The rich markdown
  renderer lives in the VS Code extension's webview, not here.
- Don't add `Buffer` polyfills to the renderer. If a node-only library
  is required, do the work in main and IPC the result.
- Don't trust the GPU/network warnings on first dev boot — they're
  Electron complaining about a sandboxed shell environment, not bugs in
  the app.
