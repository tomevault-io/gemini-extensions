## backporcher

> Backporcher is a parallel Claude Code agent dispatcher. GitHub Issues are the task queue: label an issue with `backporcher`, and the daemon picks it up, runs a sandboxed `claude -p` agent in a git worktree, creates a PR, reviews it via a coordinator agent, monitors CI, auto-merges on success, and closes the issue.

# CLAUDE.md — Backporcher

Backporcher is a parallel Claude Code agent dispatcher. GitHub Issues are the task queue: label an issue with `backporcher`, and the daemon picks it up, runs a sandboxed `claude -p` agent in a git worktree, creates a PR, reviews it via a coordinator agent, monitors CI, auto-merges on success, and closes the issue.

## Architecture

```
GitHub Issue (label: backporcher)
  → Issue Poller (30s)
    → Batch Orchestrator (haiku, for 2+ issues per repo)
      → SQLite queue (with priority + dependency chain)
        → Conflict check (haiku, ~$0.001) — serializes overlapping tasks
          → Task Executor (semaphore: 2 concurrent, respects dependencies)
            → Credential sync (auto if stale)
            → Navigation Context (sonnet queries code graph → relevant files/symbols)
              → claude -p in sandboxed worktree (with stack info + learnings + navigation map)
                → Build verification (optional, per-repo)
                  → git push + gh pr create
                    → Code Graph (Tree-sitter → blast radius BFS)
                      → Coordinator Review (claude -p reviews diff + impacted code)
                      → CI Monitor (retries up to 3x on failure)
                        → Merge gate (hold for approval or auto-merge)
                          → Close issue (label: backporcher-done)
```

## Six Concurrent Loops

The worker daemon (`src/worker.py`) runs up to 6 async loops via `asyncio.gather()`:

1. **Issue Poller** (every 30s) — scans GitHub for issues labeled `backporcher`, deduplicates (including failed tasks, excludes completed no-op tasks with no PR), batch-orchestrates 2+ issues per repo (assigns priorities, dependencies, models via haiku), creates tasks, claims issues with `backporcher-in-progress` label
2. **Task Executor** (every 5s) — claims queued tasks (bounded by semaphore), syncs credentials, generates navigation context (sonnet + code graph → relevant files/symbols for the agent), runs `claude -p` in isolated worktrees with structured prompt (stack info + learnings + navigation map + task), optionally runs build verification, creates PRs. Auto-retries transient failures (auth, permissions, stale branches)
3. **Coordinator Reviewer** (every 15s) — reviews each PR diff via `claude -p`, checks for conflicts with other open PRs, approves or rejects. Backfills missing `pr_number` from `pr_url`
4. **CI Monitor** (every 60s) — checks CI status on approved PRs, auto-merges passing PRs (squash), auto-retries failures with CI log context, closes GitHub issues on success
5. **Artifact Cleanup** (every 5 min) — removes worktrees and remote branches for terminal tasks older than 10 minutes
6. **Dashboard** (optional) — aiohttp web server with HTTP Basic Auth, real-time SSE updates every 5s. Warm light theme: cream/beige base (#F5F5DC), translucent glass panels with backdrop blur, SF Pro + system font typography, pulsing badges for active states, warm red-orange success ring gauges. Theme CSS served from `backporcher-theme.css` (editable without restart). Only starts when `BACKPORCHER_DASHBOARD_PASSWORD` is set. Features: inline Approve/Hold/Reject/Escalate/Re-queue buttons, task detail panel with timeline, edit modal for prompt/model/priority rewriting, pipeline summary with metrics (merged count, success rate, avg time, retry rate), global Pause/Resume toggle. API: `POST /api/tasks/{id}/approve|hold|reject|edit|requeue|escalate`, `POST /api/pause|resume`, `GET /api/stats`

## Task Status Flow

```
queued → working → pr_created → reviewing → reviewed → ci_passed → completed (merged)
                                                                 → hold=merge_approval (review-merge mode)
                                                                   → backporcher approve → completed
                                                     → retrying → pr_created (retry loop, up to 3x)
                                                     → failed (max retries exhausted)
                              → reviewing → failed (coordinator rejected PR)
       → hold=dispatch_approval (review-all mode) → backporcher approve → working
       → failed (agent error / exit != 0)
       → failed (safety scan blocked PR — secrets or dangerous patterns detected)
       → completed (agent ran but no changes to push)
       → queued (auto-retry on transient failure, up to 2x)
       → hold=circuit_breaker (repo failure rate too high, auto-releases after cooldown)
any    → cancelled (manual via CLI)
```

## Orchestrator Mode

Controls how much human oversight the pipeline requires. Set via `BACKPORCHER_APPROVAL_MODE`:

| Mode | Dispatch | Merge | Default |
|------|----------|-------|---------|
| `full-auto` | automatic | automatic | |
| `review-merge` | automatic | approval required | yes |
| `review-all` | approval required | approval required | |

**Hold system**: Tasks have a `hold` column. When set, the task is skipped by the relevant loop. Hold values: `merge_approval`, `dispatch_approval`, `user_hold`, `conflict_hold`, `circuit_breaker`. CLI commands: `backporcher approve <id>`, `backporcher hold <id>`, `backporcher release <id>`.

**Conflict detection**: Before dispatching, Haiku checks if the new task overlaps in file footprint with in-flight tasks in the same repo. If conflict detected, the new task gets `depends_on_task_id` set to the conflicting task (serializes them via the existing dependency mechanism).

**Global pause**: `backporcher pause` / `backporcher resume` — freezes the dispatch queue. In-flight tasks finish normally.

## Database

SQLite with WAL mode at `data/backporcher.db`. Schema version 8.

**Tables:** `repos` (with `verify_command`, `stack_info`), `tasks` (with `review_summary`, `pr_number`, `retry_count`, `priority`, `depends_on_task_id`, `hold`, `agent_started_at`, `agent_finished_at`, `model_used`, `initial_model`), `task_logs`, `metrics`, `repo_learnings`, `system_state`, `schema_version`

**Concurrency:** All writes go through `asyncio.Lock` (`_write_lock`) to prevent SQLite write conflicts. `busy_timeout=5000ms` for reader contention. The sync wrapper (`SyncDatabase`) is used by CLI commands only.

**Migrations:** Handled in `_migrate_sync()` — runs on every connect. Creates fresh v8 schema for new databases, or migrates existing v1→v2→…→v8 via table recreation + ALTER TABLE.

**Dedup:** `get_task_by_issue()` checks all non-cancelled tasks for the same issue, preventing duplicate task creation even for failed tasks.

## Security Model

### Agent Sandboxing
Agents run as `backporcher-agent` via `sudo -u backporcher-agent`. This is a restricted system user with:
- **CAN:** Read/write worktree files, git commit/push, run build/test tools, call Anthropic API
- **CANNOT:** Read admin's home (`~/.ssh`, `~/.claude`, gh tokens), access OpenClaw secrets, sudo, modify system files
- Process limits enforced via `prlimit` (500 processes, 2GB file size)
- Claude credentials are copied (not symlinked) to the agent user's home
- Agent output buffer capped at 10MB to prevent memory exhaustion
- Sensitive env vars (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `GITHUB_TOKEN`, etc.) stripped from agent subprocess

### Privilege Separation
- `gh` CLI (GitHub API) runs only in the worker process as the admin user — agents never call `gh` directly
- The worker process is the only one that modifies issue labels, posts comments, merges/closes PRs
- Agent output is treated as untrusted — summaries are truncated before storage

### systemd Hardening
The service runs with: `ProtectSystem=full`, `PrivateTmp=yes`, `PrivateDevices=yes`, `PrivateIPC=yes`, `ProtectKernelTunables=yes`, `ProtectKernelLogs=yes`, `ProtectControlGroups=yes`, `ProtectHostname=yes`, `ProtectClock=yes`, `RestrictNamespaces=yes`. Log files created with `0o640` permissions.

### Author Allowlist
Only issues created by users in `BACKPORCHER_ALLOWED_USERS` are picked up. Prevents arbitrary code execution from unknown issue authors.

## Self-Healing Features

1. **PID lock** — Worker writes `data/backporcher.pid` on startup, checks for stale/live PIDs, prevents duplicate workers that cause SQLite contention.
2. **Idempotent branch cleanup** — Before creating a worktree, deletes any stale branch from a previous attempt. Re-queuing a failed task always works.
3. **Smart startup recovery** — On daemon start, checks if agent PIDs are still alive before resetting tasks. Tasks with live agents stay `working`; only dead agents get re-queued. `reviewing` tasks reset to `pr_created`.
4. **Credential auto-sync** — Before each dispatch, compares admin vs agent credential file mtimes. If admin's are newer, auto-copies to agent user.
4. **Agent failure auto-retry** — Any non-zero agent exit code triggers re-queue with model escalation (sonnet → opus), up to `max_task_retries` (default 3). Stale branches are cleaned up idempotently before each dispatch.
5. **PR number backfill** — If `pr_number` is NULL but `pr_url` exists, the coordinator extracts it automatically. Never blocks on missing data.
6. **Startup preflight** — Clones or fetches all registered repos, verifies agent user can access repos directory, and syncs credentials before entering poll loops.
7. **Dependency failure cascade** — When a task fails, all queued tasks that depend on it (and their dependents) are automatically marked as failed.
8. **Terminal state label sync** — All failure paths (agent, verify, CI, coordinator, exceptions) update GitHub issue labels to `backporcher-failed`. No more stale `backporcher-in-progress` labels on finished issues.
9. **Automatic artifact cleanup** — Worktrees and remote branches are deleted on every terminal state (completed, failed, cancelled). A periodic cleanup loop (every 5 min) catches any stragglers older than 10 minutes.
10. **Merge failure recovery** — When PR merge fails without a conflict, the task is marked `failed` instead of silently stalling in `ci_passed`.

## Batch Orchestration

When the issue poller finds 2+ new issues for the same repo, it batch-orchestrates them via a single haiku call instead of triaging each individually. The orchestrator:

1. Assigns **model** (sonnet/opus) per issue based on complexity
2. Assigns **priority** (1-N, lower = runs first)
3. Identifies **dependencies** between issues (e.g., sequential file changes)

Tasks are created in a two-pass process: first all tasks are inserted, then `depends_on_task_id` is set using the issue→task_id mapping. The executor skips blocked tasks (those whose dependency hasn't completed). If a task fails, failure cascades recursively to all queued dependents.

Single new issues still use the existing `triage_issue()` haiku call. Opus-labeled issues bypass orchestration entirely.

**Fallback:** If batch orchestration times out (90s) or returns invalid JSON, falls back to individual triage per issue.

## Build Verification

Repos can have a `verify_command` (e.g., `npm test 2>&1` or `cargo check --workspace 2>&1`) that runs after the agent completes but before PR creation. If verification fails, the agent is re-run with the error output as context, up to `BACKPORCHER_MAX_VERIFY_RETRIES` times.

```bash
backporcher repo verify <name> <command>   # Set verify command
backporcher repo verify <name>             # Clear verify command
backporcher repo learnings <name>          # Show recorded learnings for a repo
```

## Reflection (Failure Diagnosis)

Before retrying a failed task, a cheap haiku call (`run_reflection()` in `reflection.py`) diagnoses the root cause. The structured output includes `root_cause`, `error_pattern`, `hypothesis`, and `suggested_approach`. This reflection is:

1. **Fed into the retry prompt** — the next agent attempt gets a `## Failure Diagnosis` section explaining what went wrong and how to fix it
2. **Stored in task logs** — visible in `backporcher status <id>` for observability
3. **Advisory only** — if reflection fails (timeout, bad JSON), the retry proceeds without it

**Cost:** ~$0.001 per reflection (haiku, 60s timeout). Only runs on agent failure retries, not on rate-limit fallbacks.

## Safety Scan (Pre-PR Static Analysis)

After build verification passes but before PR creation, `run_safety_scan()` in `safety.py` scans all changed files for:

1. **Secrets** (severity: BLOCK) — AWS keys, GitHub tokens, private key blocks, API key assignments, Slack tokens, bearer tokens
2. **Dangerous patterns** (severity: WARN) — `eval()`, `exec()`, `subprocess shell=True`, `os.system()`, `rm -rf /`, `chmod 777`, SQL injection via f-strings, disabled SSL verification, wildcard CORS

**Behavior:**
- **BLOCK findings** → task fails immediately, PR is never created, issue labeled `backporcher-failed`, learning recorded as `safety_blocked`
- **WARN findings** → logged for observability, PR creation proceeds, coordinator review sees the warnings

**Scope:** Only scans files changed by the agent (via `git diff`). Skips binary files, lock files, and non-code extensions. Shannon entropy detection for high-entropy strings is available but not currently wired to reduce false positives.

## Circuit Breaker (Per-Repo Failure Protection)

`circuit_breaker.py` tracks recent task outcomes per repo. When the failure rate exceeds a threshold, new tasks for that repo are held instead of dispatched.

| Parameter | Value | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| `WINDOW_SECONDS` | 3600 | Look-back window (1 hour) |
| `FAILURE_THRESHOLD` | 0.7 | Trip when >= 70% of recent tasks failed |
| `MIN_TASKS_FOR_TRIP` | 3 | Minimum tasks in window before tripping |
| `COOLDOWN_SECONDS` | 1800 | Half-open after 30 min cooldown |

**States:**
- **CLOSED** — normal operation, tasks dispatch freely
- **OPEN** — too many recent failures, new tasks held with `hold=circuit_breaker`
- **HALF-OPEN** — cooldown expired, one task allowed through to test recovery

**Integration:** Checked in `try_claim_and_dispatch()` after claiming a task, before conflict detection. Fail-open: if the DB query fails, the task proceeds. Tasks held by the circuit breaker auto-release when the cooldown expires (the next claim attempt re-checks).

## GitHub Label Protocol

| Label | Meaning | Set by |
|-------|---------|--------|
| `backporcher` | Ready for agent pickup | User |
| `backporcher-in-progress` | Agent claimed and working | Daemon |
| `backporcher-done` | CI passed, PR merged, issue closed | Daemon |
| `backporcher-failed` | Max retries exhausted or coordinator rejected | Daemon |
| `opus` | Use opus model instead of default | User |

## Agent Intelligence Layer

Agents receive a structured prompt with four layers of context, each building on the last. The code graph is used twice: once for agent navigation (pre-dispatch) and once for coordinator blast radius analysis (post-PR).

### Structured Agent Prompt

```
IMPORTANT: You are running non-interactively...

## Project Context               ← auto-detected tech stack (e.g. "Next.js 15 + TypeScript + Prisma")
## Learnings from Previous Tasks  ← last 10 outcomes from this repo (successes + failures)
## Navigation Context             ← sonnet-curated file map from code graph
## Task                           ← the actual issue to implement
## Execution Guidelines           ← non-interactive agent rules
```

### Stack Detection

`detect_stack()` in repo_intel.py inspects project files (`package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `Cargo.toml`, etc.) and stores the result in `repos.stack_info`. Runs during preflight and before each dispatch if not yet detected. Shows in `backporcher repo list`.

### Learning Loop

`record_learning()` in repo_intel.py captures outcomes at 5 terminal points: agent failure (retries exhausted), verify failure, coordinator rejection, CI failure (retries exhausted), and successful merge. `get_learnings_text()` formats the last 10 as a prompt section. Stored in `repo_learnings` table, queryable via `backporcher repo learnings <name>`.

### Navigation Context

Before the work agent starts, `generate_navigation_context()` in navigation.py:
1. Calls `ensure_graph()` (pre-built in preflight, incremental update if already exists)
2. Calls `build_navigation_context()` in graph/context.py — extracts keywords from task prompt, runs `search_nodes()` + `get_impact_radius(depth=1)` to find relevant files/symbols
3. Calls sonnet (single-shot, 60s timeout) to distill raw graph data into a curated file map with rationale
4. Formats into `## Navigation Context` section, capped at ~4k chars

**Cost:** ~$0.01 per task. **Kill switch:** `BACKPORCHER_NAVIGATION_ENABLED=false`.

**Graceful fallback:** If the graph doesn't exist, the graph query returns nothing, sonnet times out, or sonnet returns invalid JSON, the agent runs without navigation context. Navigation never blocks dispatch.

## Coordinator Review

The coordinator is a lightweight `claude -p` call (300s timeout, not the full 3600s agent timeout) that receives:
- The original task prompt
- The full PR diff (smart-truncated via code graph budget allocation)
- A blast radius analysis: directly changed symbols, indirectly impacted functions/classes/tests, key dependency edges, and impacted files not in the diff
- A list of all other open Backporcher PRs in the same repo (for conflict detection)

Before review, `ensure_graph()` builds or incrementally updates a per-repo dependency graph (Tree-sitter AST → SQLite → NetworkX BFS). `build_review_context()` then extracts changed files from the diff, runs `get_impact_radius(depth=2)`, and formats the blast radius for the prompt. Graph data is wrapped in `<graph-context>` untrusted-data delimiters with `VERDICT` strings stripped to prevent prompt injection from malicious function names.

Falls back gracefully to raw 15k-char diff truncation if graph build/query fails.

It evaluates: task relevance, obvious bugs/regressions, security issues, conflicts with other in-flight PRs, scope appropriateness, and whether indirectly impacted functions/tests might break.

Output must end with `VERDICT: APPROVE` or `VERDICT: REJECT — {reason}`. The parser strips markdown bold/italic before matching.

On approve: status → `reviewed`, summary posted as PR comment, CI monitor picks up.
On reject: PR closed with explanation, issue labeled `backporcher-failed`, status → `failed`.
On review error: auto-approved (fail-open) so CI can still gate.

## Auto-Merge & Issue Lifecycle

When CI passes on an approved PR:
1. PR is merged via `gh pr merge --squash`
2. Issue gets `backporcher-done` label, `backporcher-in-progress` removed
3. Comment posted: "CI passed. PR has been merged. Closing issue."
4. Issue is closed with reason `completed`

## Known Gotchas

- **no_checks blocks merge:** If a repo has no GitHub Actions workflows, the CI monitor blocks the PR from advancing (stays in `reviewed`). A one-time warning is logged. Add a `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to the repo to unblock.
- **CLAUDECODE env var:** Must be unset in agent subprocesses to avoid Claude Code nested-session detection. The dispatcher strips it from the environment.
- **Per-repo git locks:** Git operations (fetch, worktree create) are serialized per-repo via `asyncio.Lock` to prevent concurrent fetch/checkout conflicts.
- **SQLite write lock:** All DB writes go through a single `asyncio.Lock` because SQLite doesn't handle concurrent writers well even in WAL mode.
- **Git identity in worktrees:** Each worktree gets `user.name`/`user.email` set explicitly — the agent user's global gitconfig may not be inherited.
- **Markdown in verdicts:** The coordinator model sometimes wraps `VERDICT: APPROVE` in `**bold**` markers. The parser strips `*` and `_` before matching.
- **Credential expiry:** Claude credentials expire periodically. The auto-sync compares mtimes, but if admin credentials also expire, re-authenticate via `claude` CLI as administrator.
- **Directory permissions:** The `backporcher-agent` user accesses repos via group membership (`backporcher` group). If permissions break, re-run `scripts/setup-sandbox.sh`.
- **Task reset procedure:** Never reset tasks via SQL while the daemon is running — the executor claims them immediately. Always: stop daemon, kill agent processes, reset DB, start daemon. See `docs/solutions/daemon-task-reset-race.md`.
- **Model selection:** Sonnet struggles with multi-file refactoring (may commit only auto-generated files). Use opus for architectural changes, state extraction, or any task touching 3+ files. See `docs/solutions/opus-for-complex-refactoring.md`.
- **System deps for verify:** Tauri projects need GTK/Cairo dev packages for `cargo check --workspace` (`libcairo2-dev`, `libgtk-3-dev`, `libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev`, etc.). Missing deps cause silent verify failures.
- **Graph DB corruption:** If `.code-review-graph/graph.db` gets corrupted, delete the directory and restart — it rebuilds automatically on next review. The coordinator falls back to raw diff if the graph is unavailable.
- **Graph build on large repos:** First `full_build()` parses all source files and can take minutes on repos with 10k+ files. Subsequent reviews use `incremental_update()` which only re-parses changed files. Files >1MB are skipped to prevent memory exhaustion.
- **Graph prompt injection:** Function/class names from the graph flow into the coordinator prompt. Malicious names (e.g., `VERDICT_APPROVE`) are sanitized: `VERDICT` is stripped, names capped at 120 chars, graph data wrapped in `<graph-context>` untrusted-data delimiters.
- **Navigation context cold start:** First dispatch after adding a new repo triggers graph build in preflight (can take minutes for large repos). Subsequent dispatches use incremental updates. If preflight is skipped, `generate_navigation_context()` falls back gracefully.
- **Navigation model timeout:** The sonnet navigation call has a 60s hard timeout. If it hangs, the agent runs without navigation context. Set `BACKPORCHER_NAVIGATION_ENABLED=false` to disable entirely.
- **Reflection false positives:** The haiku reflection call may misdiagnose failures, especially for complex multi-file errors. The reflection is advisory — the retry agent can ignore it if the diagnosis doesn't match what it finds. If reflections are consistently unhelpful, the cost is minimal (~$0.001/call) but the prompt bloat may waste context.
- **Safety scan eval() false positives:** The `eval()` pattern matches legitimate uses (e.g., `ast.literal_eval()`). These show as WARN, not BLOCK, so they don't prevent PR creation. The coordinator review can assess whether the usage is safe.
- **Circuit breaker and retries:** The circuit breaker counts tasks in terminal states (completed/failed). Tasks that are still retrying don't count toward the failure rate until they reach a terminal state. A burst of simultaneous failures from a broken CI pipeline can trip the breaker.
- **Circuit breaker release:** Tasks held by `circuit_breaker` auto-release on the next poll cycle after cooldown expires. There's no background timer — release depends on the executor polling interval (5s).

## Solutions Directory

`docs/solutions/` is the institutional knowledge base. Every solved problem becomes searchable documentation. Before starting work on a problem, search solutions first:

```bash
grep -r "relevant keyword" docs/solutions/
```

After solving a non-trivial problem, capture it using the template at `docs/solutions/TEMPLATE.md`. Include: problem, root cause, solution code, prevention strategy.

## Development

```bash
# Install in dev mode
pip install -e .

# Run worker foreground (ctrl+c to stop)
backporcher worker

# Python 3.11+ required
# Dependencies: aiosqlite, aiohttp, tree-sitter, tree-sitter-language-pack, networkx
```

The codebase is intentionally minimal — no ORM, no task queue library. Just asyncio + aiohttp + sqlite + Tree-sitter + subprocess + gh CLI.

## Linting

**Always run `ruff check .` and `ruff format --check .` before committing.** Fix all issues before the commit — never push code that fails lint or format checks. Config is in `pyproject.toml`.

## Documentation Rules

When committing and pushing changes that meaningfully affect project structure or functionality, always update both `README.md` and `CLAUDE.md` in the same commit. "Meaningful" means: new features, changed architecture, new config options, new CLI commands, changed file purposes, or new known gotchas. Cosmetic changes (formatting, typos, internal refactors with no API change) do not require doc updates.
