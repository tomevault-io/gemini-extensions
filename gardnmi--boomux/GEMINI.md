# Repository Workflow

## Start Here

Use `DEVELOPMENT.md` for the human development lifecycle and local build loop.
Use product documentation in this order:

1. `CONTEXT.md` defines canonical product terms and distinctions. Preserve those
   semantics when names in code are less precise.
2. `docs/architecture.md` describes the current implementation boundaries and
   cross-cutting invariants.
3. Contract documents such as `docs/cli-json.md`, `docs/event-stream.md`, and
   `docs/live-pty-handoff.md` govern their
   named interfaces and guarantees.
4. `docs/adr/` records accepted decisions and rationale.
5. `docs/lifecycle-validation.md` records compatibility evidence from specific
   host versions; it is evidence, not a general specification.
6. `docs/roadmap.md` is non-authoritative future intent. Documents marked as
   historical explain how the design was reached but do not override current
   architecture, source, or tests.

For exact protocol and persistence versions, source and compatibility tests are
authoritative. Start a change in the owning module listed in the architecture
module map, then read its colocated tests and the relevant contract document.

## Local Build Cache

- Use kache for local Rust builds. `.cargo/config.toml` selects
  `scripts/rustc-cache.sh`, so ordinary `cargo check`, `build`, `test`, and
  `clippy` commands use it automatically when `kache` is on PATH.
- Manage project development tools with **mise**; keep version pins in
  `mise.toml`. Run `mise install` when setting up a checkout. Kache **0.27.0**
  is installed from its official GitHub release through mise, alongside Zig.
  Do not install a separate kache binary with Cargo or a manual download.
- Use `mise exec -- cargo ...` in agent/non-interactive shells so the pinned
  tools are on PATH; an activated mise shell may use ordinary Cargo commands.
  Check `mise exec -- kache --version` before the first build on a new machine.
  If unavailable, report that caching is disabled; the wrapper permits an
  uncached build. Do not run `kache init`:
  project configuration already enables it without editing global Cargo/shell
  settings or installing a login service.
- `.kache.toml` selects local-only caching, automatic garbage collection, and a
  **20 GiB store budget**. Adaptive/forced incremental caching is disabled to
  avoid accumulating per-worktree incremental state. Native build-script runs
  (including Ghostty's Zig build) remain uncached; Rust compiler outputs are
  cached. Do not enable remote uploads or broaden native caching implicitly.
- Keep each worktree's own `target/` directory. Kache shares reusable artifacts;
  do not point concurrent worktrees at one Cargo target directory.
- Inspect reuse with `kache report --last-build --root "$PWD"` and `kache stats`.
  A Cargo-fresh build may invoke no compiler and produce no new cache events.
  Do not claim a hit rate or speedup without checking the actual report.
  `kache doctor` may flag our delegating wrapper because it expects a direct
  kache wrapper; do not replace project configuration with `doctor --fix`.
- Use `KACHE_DISABLED=1 cargo ...` for a temporary uncached comparison. CI skips
  this wrapper's cache and retains its existing caching workflow. Preserve exact
  compiler arguments and exit status; never retry a failed cached compile
  automatically as an uncached build.
- Cache GC does not cap all project disk usage: target files can retain shared
  blocks. Inspect `kache targets` and a cleanup dry run before removing stale
  outputs. **Never broadly clean `target/`** without preserving
  `target/desktop-dev/`, which contains development session/configuration data.
  Follow the existing worktree-removal rules; caches do not authorize deleting
  worktrees or user work.

See [the local build-cache guide](DEVELOPMENT.md#local-build-cache).

## Validation

Use focused local checks during development. PR CI owns the complete validation
selected by `docs/ci.md`; do not run the full root/Desktop suites or a release
build locally as a routine prerequisite to opening or updating a PR. Require all
selected CI checks to pass before merging.

Do not over-apply validation. Choose the smallest check that answers a concrete
question about the changed behavior, then stop when it passes. Do not stack
`cargo check`, Clippy, full tests, and release builds "just to be safe," or treat
the command lists below as mandatory local gates. Documentation-only edits need
no Rust checks. Small UI edits do not automatically justify a full test build.
Do not repeat successful checks unless subsequent changes affect what they
validated. Report any unverified behavior plainly and leave comprehensive
coverage to PR CI; do not delay reviewable work to duplicate CI locally.

| Change | Local development validation |
| --- | --- |
| Unpackaged Markdown/guidance only | Review links and claims; `git diff --check` |
| Desktop Rust only, optionally with guidance | Formatting and `cargo check -p boomux-desktop --locked`; focused tests or a manual UI check for the changed behavior |
| CI/workflow or packaging scripts without Rust/dependency changes | Relevant Python/Bun/shell fixtures and shell syntax; actionlint for workflow changes |
| Backend Rust | Formatting, `cargo check --locked`, and focused unit/integration tests for the changed behavior |
| Shared dependencies, Cargo/toolchain, or vendored code | Check affected packages and run focused compatibility checks; let PR CI cover the full matrix |

Scale local checks to the change. A filtered Rust test still compiles its test
binary and dependencies, so use `cargo check` first for small compile-only edits.
Do not add tests that only mirror cosmetic UI changes. Broaden local validation
only for a concrete failure, an identified affected behavior, CI diagnosis, or an
explicit user request. State what the additional check will resolve; generic
caution or a desire for extra confidence is not sufficient. Unknown or mixed
inputs select full validation in CI, not automatically on
the development machine. Use local release builds for performance measurements,
release-only issues, or packaging work that needs the actual optimized artifact.

The full commands below are a reference for reproducing CI failures or explicitly
requested comprehensive local validation, not a per-edit or pre-PR checklist.
Clippy already checks every benchmark target.

The complete root validation set is:

```console
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features --locked -- -D warnings
cargo test --lib --bins --locked -- --test-threads=1
cargo test --test config_cli --locked -- --test-threads=1
cargo test --test native_backend --locked -- --test-threads=1
cargo test --test benchmark_harness --features benchmark-internals --locked
cargo bench --bench core_cpu --bench wire --features benchmark-internals --locked -- --test
cargo deny check
bun test integrations/opencode/boomux.test.js integrations/opencode/boomux-tui.test.js integrations/pi/boomux.test.js
```

The workspace also contains `desktop/`; read `desktop/AGENTS.md` for GUI changes.
Core commands above select the default root package and require no Zig or display
SDK. For comprehensive backend/shared-code validation, the additional set is:

```console
cargo clippy -p boomux-desktop --all-targets --all-features --locked -- -D warnings
cargo test -p boomux-desktop --locked -- --test-threads=1
cargo build -p boomux-desktop --release --locked
python3 -m unittest discover -s .github/scripts -p 'test_ci_*.py'
python3 desktop/scripts/test-installer.py
python3 desktop/scripts/test-smoke.py
python3 -m unittest discover -s desktop/scripts -p 'test_package*.py'
bun install --cwd .github/release-tests --frozen-lockfile
bun test --cwd .github/release-tests
```

Desktop requires Zig 0.15.2 and the graphics dependencies listed in
`.github/workflows/desktop-build.yml`. Bundle changes also require X11 and
Wayland smoke tests described in `docs/desktop/releases.md`.

Run the narrowest relevant tests while iterating and leave the complete selected
set to PR CI. Native backend tests are intentionally serial because they exercise
process, socket, PTY, and daemon lifecycle behavior.

### Testing By Change Type

| Change | Expected coverage |
| --- | --- |
| Protocol field or request | Protocol serialization/defaulting and minimum-version tests, client negotiation tests, and native mixed-version behavior |
| Persisted state shape | `state_store.rs` migration tests and a cold-recovery native test |
| PTY, attachment, or process lifecycle | Colocated unit tests plus serial `native_backend` scenarios |
| Graceful handoff | Serial native tests covering rollback, reconnect, PID preservation, and later cleanup |
| TUI state or rendering | Focused `tui.rs` model, input, and rendering tests |
| Performance hot path or benchmark | Semantic tests, deterministic benchmark fixtures, benchmark smoke, and before/after evidence from the same machine |
| OpenCode, Pi, Claude, Codex, or Kiro reducer | The corresponding focused reducer tests, including `boomux-tui.test.js` for OpenCode TUI claims |
| Host compatibility claim | Focused fixtures plus an update to `docs/lifecycle-validation.md` when validated live |

## Performance And Memory

Treat CPU efficiency and memory use as design constraints for every runtime
change, not as cleanup work deferred until after correctness. Consider both the
fixed daemon footprint and the marginal cost of each Shell, active terminal,
Agent, attachment, and remote Node.

- Evaluate idle and output-heavy behavior at realistic scale. A change that is
  cheap for one terminal or client may be unacceptable across hundreds or
  thousands.
- Avoid per-Shell or per-attachment heavyweight runtimes, duplicate terminal
  state, unnecessary output copies, polling loops, and work proportional to all
  managed resources when only one resource changed.
- Bound queues, buffers, histories, caches, projections, and persisted
  collections. Define overload behavior explicitly rather than allowing memory
  growth to become implicit backpressure.
- Reclaim runtime state promptly after attachments disconnect and Shells,
  Agents, or Nodes close. Test repeated create/attach/detach/close cycles when a
  change could retain allocations, tasks, descriptors, or subprocesses.
- Preserve idle efficiency. Background maintenance should be event-driven or
  use bounded adaptive intervals, and should not wake per managed resource
  without evidence that the cost is necessary.
- For performance-sensitive changes, measure before and after using the same
  machine, build profile, fixtures, and workload. Report fixed cost, marginal
  cost per scaled resource, steady-state CPU, peak memory, and retained memory
  after cleanup when applicable.
- Do not trade correctness, lifecycle authority, or bounded behavior for a
  benchmark result. Document any intentional performance or memory regression
  with evidence and rationale in the PR.

## Safety And Compatibility

- `boomux daemon stop` terminates every managed process. Prefer
  `boomux daemon restart` when testing compatible rebuilt binaries.
- Preserve exact argument vectors; do not introduce shell interpolation into
  launchers, commands, process adapters, or integration execution.
- Treat shell runs and Agent instances as run-scoped. Never infer permanent
  Agent completion from process exit or quiet terminal output.
- Do not persist attachment environments. They are ephemeral startup input and
  may contain private data.
- Preserve persistence-before-event publication and the documented daemon lock
  order when changing coordinated mutations.

### Protocol Changes

- Bump `PROTOCOL_VERSION` only when wire behavior requires it.
- Update `Request::minimum_protocol_version` for new requests.
- Define additive defaults and old-client response filtering or downgrade
  behavior.
- Add round-trip, old-peer, client-negotiation, and native compatibility tests.
- Update advertised capabilities when the new behavior is integration-visible.
- Update the protocol history in `docs/architecture.md` and any affected
  contract document.

### Persistence Changes

- Bump `STATE_VERSION` when the durable representation changes.
- Retain the previous schema and add an explicit migration; never silently
  reinterpret persisted fields.
- Add migration, invalid-state, cold-recovery, and graceful-handoff coverage as
  applicable.
- Keep state bounded, owner-validated, atomically replaced, and reproducible.
- Document changes to recovery guarantees in `docs/architecture.md`.

## Commits

- Use Conventional Commits for every commit: `type(scope): description` or
  `type: description`.
- Use `feat` for user-visible capabilities, `fix` for user-visible corrections,
  `perf` for performance improvements, and `refactor` for internal product
  improvements that preserve behavior. Use `docs`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, or
  `chore` when the change is not release-note material.
- Mark breaking changes with `!` after the type or scope and explain them in a
  `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer.
- Keep the description imperative, lowercase, and concise.

## Pull Requests And Releases

- Use a Conventional Commit title for every PR. The title must describe the
  release impact of the complete PR, for example `feat: add workspace previews`
  or `fix(agent): preserve lifecycle registration`.
- Choose a Release Please-recognized title deliberately: `feat` triggers a minor
  release; `fix`, `perf`, and `refactor` trigger a patch release; and `!` or a
  `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer triggers a major release. Use non-release types such
  as `docs`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, or `chore` only when the PR has no
  release-visible impact. Never mislabel internal work solely to force a
  version.
- Squash-merge PRs into `main` so the conventional PR title becomes the
  main-branch commit consumed by Release Please.
- Normal Release Please runs are triggered only after CI succeeds for the exact
  `main` commit. Manual tag dispatch is reserved for explicit release recovery.
- Before merging, update the PR title if its release type or scope changed.
- If a PR contains existing non-conventional commits, add a Release Please
  commit override to the PR body and squash-merge it:

  ```text
  BEGIN_COMMIT_OVERRIDE
  feat: describe the complete release-visible change
  END_COMMIT_OVERRIDE
  ```
