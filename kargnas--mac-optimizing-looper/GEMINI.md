Guidance for AI agents working on **Mac Optimizing Looper** — a macOS menu-bar app that
periodically analyzes system load with Claude and surfaces prioritized advice.

## Build / Run

- Package manager: SwiftPM. `swift build`, `swift test` (run both before finishing).
- **Always launch via the app bundle**, not the bare binary:
  ```bash
  bash script/build_and_run.sh run
  ```
  This builds `dist/MacOptimizingLooper.app`, codesigns it ad-hoc, and `open -n`s it. The
  bundle id is `as.kargn.MacOptimizingLooper`; it is `LSUIElement` (no Dock icon).
- **Why the bundle matters:** `UNUserNotificationCenter` needs a real bundle proxy. A
  bare `.build/.../MacOptimizingLooper` binary has no bundle id, so notifications silently
  fail there. Code guards on `Bundle.main.bundleIdentifier != nil` and falls back to
  opening the result window directly — but for real testing, run the bundle.
- Config lives at `~/.config/mac-optimizing-looper/config.json` and is read once at launch
  (`AppConfig.loadDefault()`). After editing config by hand, **restart the app**.
- `provider` (config, default `claude`) selects the LLM backend (`claude`|`codex`); an
  absent/unknown value resolves to `claude` so old configs keep working. See **LLM
  providers** below.
- `thinkingLevel` (config) = the reasoning level for the **analysis pass**, provider-relative
  (claude `--effort`, codex `model_reasoning_effort`; low/medium/high/xhigh/max, default
  `max`; invalid values clamp to `max`). The claude JSON formatter and the command
  risk-check stay at `low` by design (mechanical / fast gate).
- `fastMode` (config, default false) requests the provider's faster service tier when the
  selected model supports it (codex priority tier). No-op for claude (the CLI has no fast flag).
- `monitorSeconds` (config, default 30, clamped 0–600) = how long the mac-optimizer
  **sustained monitor** samples before evaluating. `MacOptimizerScript.runIfAvailable`
  runs the one-shot snapshot AND, when `monitorSeconds > 0`, a second `--monitor N`
  pass (separate script mode) appended to the report. `0` disables the monitor pass.
  The scan script (`mac-optimize.sh`) is **bundled** into `Contents/Resources/` by both
  build scripts from the tracked source at `.agents/skills/mac-optimizer/`.
  `MacOptimizerScript` resolves it from `Bundle.main` only (plus a repo-CWD dev fallback
  and the `MAC_OPTIMIZER_SCRIPT` override) and **never from `$HOME`** — so binary-install
  and Homebrew-cask users are self-contained, not dependent on a separately-installed skill.

## Release pipeline

`script/build-app.zsh` packages a distributable `dist/MacOptimizingLooper.app` (release
build + version-stamped `Info.plist`). Local default is ad-hoc sign; CI sets
`CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY="Developer ID Application"` + `HARDENED_RUNTIME=1` for a
notarizable bundle. Keep it separate from `build_and_run.sh` (that is the fast
debug dev loop). `.github/workflows/auto-release.yml` bumps the patch version on
pushes to `main` and dispatches `build-release.yml` (build → sign → notarize → DMG
→ GitHub Release → `update-tap` writes the `kargnas/homebrew-tap` cask). The
pipeline is **inert until signing secrets exist** — see `docs/release-setup.md`.
Sparkle in-app auto-update is wired (release builds set `SPARKLE_AUTO=1`; the feed is
the `latest` release's `appcast.xml`). The EdDSA key is one-time — never regenerate it.

## Terminal Launching — single entry point

All terminal-opening features (Show Command in Terminal, Claude review) go through
**`TerminalLauncher`** (`Sources/MacOptimizingLooper/TerminalLauncher.swift`). Do not open
terminals directly from `AppDelegate` or anywhere else — extend `TerminalLauncher`.

- Terminal resolution: `TerminalAppCatalog.application(bundleIdentifier:)`.
- The configured terminal (`config.terminalAppBundleIdentifier`) is **honored exactly**.
  When a specific terminal is configured but cannot be matched, we resolve it directly
  via `NSWorkspace`, and if it is genuinely not installed we return `nil` so the caller
  shows an error. **Never silently substitute a different terminal** (e.g. Apple
  Terminal) — that hid real misconfiguration and opened the wrong app.
- Per-terminal launch quirks live in `TerminalApplication.LaunchMode`
  (`appleTerminal` / `iTerm` via AppleScript, `openWithArguments` for Ghostty,
  `openCommandFile` for the rest). Unknown-but-installed terminals use `openCommandFile`.
- Scripts are written to a `.command` file and the **path only** is injected into
  AppleScript — never the multi-line/UTF-8 body (Terminal turns embedded newlines into
  Return presses, corrupting `if/elif/fi` and CJK text).

## Claude CLI invocation — headless vs interactive

`claude` starts an **interactive session by default**; `-p`/`--print` is non-interactive.
There is **no `claude run` subcommand**.

- **Headless `-p`** for anything the app parses programmatically:
  - Advice generation — `ClaudeCLIClient` (`-p --output-format text`, JSON parsed downstream).
  - Command risk check — `CommandRiskAssessor` (`-p`, parses `RISK: SAFE|DANGEROUS`).
- **Interactive `claude "<prompt>"`** for user-facing terminals:
  - "Review with Claude" — `TerminalScriptBuilder.claudeReviewScript` opens an
    interactive session seeded with the prompt via `"$(cat <promptfile>)"` so the user
    can read the assessment and keep chatting. Do not regress this back to `-p`. The
    review prompt (`claudeReviewPrompt`) is a proactive performance assistant: it
    assesses the command, then offers to inspect and clean up the system with the
    user's confirmation — not a narrow command-only reviewer.

## LLM providers — abstraction & adding one

The app drives an LLM **CLI**, not an API. Backends sit behind `LLMProviderKind`
(`claude`|`codex`) and `ProviderRegistry` (`makeClient` / `catalog`). Every in-app LLM
call (analysis, risk-check, terminal review) routes through the selected provider; the
default is `claude`. Design doc: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-20-multi-provider-llm-design.md`.

- **Capabilities** live on `LLMProviderKind`. `supportsStructuredOutput` decides the
  advice pipeline: codex returns schema-constrained JSON via `--output-schema` in one
  pass (`PromptBuilder.adviceJSONSchema` + `responseFormatGuide`); claude returns
  free-form text that the **two-pass** `format-json.sh` turns into JSON. Keep
  `PromptBuilder.responseFormatGuide` and `script/mac-optimizing-looper-response-guide.sh`
  in sync — they encode the same rules for the two paths.
- **Catalog** is dynamic: `CodexModelCatalog` parses `~/.codex/models_cache.json`
  (`$CODEX_HOME` honored); `ClaudeModelCatalog` is curated (the claude CLI has no list
  command). Missing data → empty catalog → settings offers free-text "Custom…". Never
  hardcode codex model names.
- **codex invocation** (`CodexCLIClient`): `codex exec -m <model> -c
  model_reasoning_effort="<effort>" [-c service_tier="priority"] --skip-git-repo-check
  -s read-only [--output-schema <file>] -o <file> "<system+user>" </dev/null`. codex has
  no `--system` flag (prompts are concatenated) and ignores `temperature`/`maxTokens`.
  stdin MUST be `/dev/null` or codex blocks. The `service_tier` config key was verified
  with `--strict-config`; do not guess codex config keys.
- **Adding a provider**: new `LLMClient` + `ProviderCataloging`, one `LLMProviderKind`
  case with its capability flags, and a `ProviderRegistry` branch. Settings cascades
  Provider → Model → Effort → Fast Mode automatically from the catalog.

## Command execution & safety model

`ActionPolicy.current == .userInitiatedWithSafeguards`. Advice is inert data; the model
can never make the app run anything. The single execution path is the explicit
**"Run Command Now"** menu action, gated by:

1. `CommandRiskAssessor` (`claude -p`) classifies the command; `unknown` is treated as
   dangerous (fail safe).
2. Anything not clearly `safe` → confirmation dialog (default button = Cancel).
3. `CommandExecutor.run` executes in the background. Commands containing a `sudo` token
   are routed through a GUI admin-password prompt (`osascript ... with administrator
   privileges`) because a background process has no TTY.
4. Result → macOS notification (✅/❌ + exit code); tapping it opens the full output
   window. If notifications are unavailable, the window opens directly (never lose output).

`Suggestion` carries only data (`suggestedCommand: String?`), no executable closures —
enforced by `GuardrailTests`.

## House rules (project-specific)

- **No silent fallbacks / no silent failure.** Surface errors; never substitute behavior
  the user didn't choose without telling them.
- i18n: UI chrome is fully localized via `<locale>.lproj/Localizable.strings` under
  `Sources/MacOptimizingLooperCore/Resources` (10 languages: en, ko, zh-Hans, zh-Hant,
  ja, es, de, fr, pt-BR, ru). `en` is the source of truth; every key MUST exist in every
  locale (`LocalizationTests` enforces parity). `AppStrings(languageIdentifier:)` is the
  ONLY access point — it loads the forced locale's `.lproj` sub-bundle via
  `LocalizationBundle` (region/script collapse + English fallback). Never hardcode UI text
  or branch on `isKorean`. Add a key to `en.lproj` first, then every other locale (same
  `%@` count/order). The Settings "Language" popup is driven by `AppConfig.supportedUILanguages`
  and writes `outputLanguageIdentifier`, which drives BOTH the UI language and the analysis
  output language. To add a locale: new `<id>.lproj`, a `supportedUILanguages` entry, done.
- Tests: `Tests/MacOptimizingLooperCoreTests`. Keep `GuardrailTests` green — it encodes the
  safety contract. Update it deliberately when the contract intentionally changes.
- Bundle id prefix for any new bundles: keep `as.kargn.*` consistent with the
  existing app bundle.
