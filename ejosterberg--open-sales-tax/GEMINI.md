# CLAUDE.md — open-sales-tax (OpenSalesTax)

This file gives Claude Code sessions the context they need to work on
**OpenSalesTax**, an open-source US sales tax calculation API.

## 🚨 ACTIVE KICKOFF — READ FIRST IF PRESENT

If `specs/NEXT-SESSION-KICKOFF.md` exists, **stop and read that file
before doing anything else.** It contains a session-specific action
plan from a prior session that was reset deliberately.

After executing the kickoff, delete that file (per its own
instructions) so it doesn't mislead later sessions.

## ⭐ Read these first (in order)

This project uses a **spec-driven workflow** (same pattern as Eric's
SC Books project). Before writing any code or proposing architecture,
read these files in `specs/`:

1. `specs/constitution.md` — non-negotiable principles (license,
   per-state contributor model, free-data-only, API stability)
2. `specs/current-state.md` — what exists now (likely "nothing —
   pre-build" until phase 1 ships)
3. `specs/handoff.md` — where to start
4. `specs/research/data-sources.md` — comprehensive notes on what
   data is actually available from SST + alternatives
5. `specs/research/prior-art.md` — Avalara, TaxJar, TaxCloud,
   Vertex, Sovos — what they do, where they cost too much, where
   the OSS opportunity lies
6. `specs/research/state-coverage.md` — per-state notes (SST
   member status, data availability, difficulty rating)
7. `specs/phase-1-foundation/spec.md` — initial deliverable

If specs and CLAUDE.md disagree, **specs win** — and update
CLAUDE.md to match.

## Project context

**Owner:** Eric Osterberg (ejosterberg@gmail.com), solo developer
who runs a SaaS, a locksmith shop, and an ITSP.

**Why this exists:** Eric's SC Books accounting project (in
`../CRL-NewAccounting/`) needs reliable sales-tax-rate data and
a calculation engine. Commercial options (Avalara / TaxJar) are
prohibitively expensive for small businesses. SST publishes
free, public data covering 24 states. There's no widely-adopted
open-source alternative wrapping this data into a usable API.
This project fills that gap and could become a community
infrastructure piece.

**Stack:** **NOT YET CHOSEN.** The constitution lays out three
candidates (Python+FastAPI recommended; TypeScript+Node second;
Go third) and the rationale for each. **Don't pick the stack
unilaterally** — propose to Eric in the bootstrap session and
get his sign-off before writing code.

**License:** Apache 2.0 recommended (constitution explains why).
Final call by Eric.

**Hosting model:** Self-hostable as primary (Docker, single binary
when possible). Optional hosted SaaS as a future business model;
should not constrain the OSS architecture.

## Per-state contributor pattern (the architectural keystone)

The defining design choice: **every state is a module with a common
interface.** A volunteer who knows their state's tax law can:

1. Drop in their state's data (rates, boundaries, taxability)
2. Implement any state-specific quirks (e.g., MN treats clothing as
   non-taxable; WI treats it as taxable)
3. Ship test fixtures covering edge cases unique to that state

The core engine handles common patterns (origin/destination
sourcing, jurisdiction stacking, exemption certs); state modules
handle deviations.

The 24 SST states should be **easier to bring online first** —
their data is uniform, machine-readable, and quarterly-updated.
Non-SST states (CA, TX, NY, FL, IL, PA — the big ones) require
per-state work and are where community contributions matter most.

## Data update cadence

SST publishes new rates + boundary files **quarterly** with
explicit version dates in filenames (e.g., `MNR2026Q2APR15.zip`).
Pin a build to a specific upstream release for reproducibility;
ship a CLI command + scheduled job for tenants to refresh.

## API design principles (sketched in spec)

- **Versioned** (`/v1/...`) — never break consumers silently.
- **Idempotent** for calculation calls.
- **Stateless** — no session storage; transaction context passed
  in each request.
- **Cache-friendly** — rate lookups should hit a cache aggressively.
- **Privacy-respecting** — don't log transaction details
  unnecessarily. Aggregate metrics only.
- **Multi-tenant** for the SaaS deployment mode; **single-tenant**
  for self-hosters.

## SC Books integration

The eventual primary consumer is SC Books, sitting at
`../CRL-NewAccounting/`. SC Books currently has Phase 23 tax-data
sources scaffolding (ZipTax, MN DOR clients in
`../CRL-NewAccounting/inc/tax-providers/`). Once OpenSalesTax v1
ships, SC Books can add a third provider that calls this API.

Don't tightly couple — OpenSalesTax should be useful to anyone,
not just SC Books.

## Coding conventions (when stack is chosen)

To be added once Eric picks a stack. Until then:

- **English-language docs first.** Code has to be readable by
  contributors from every state.
- **Tests are mandatory** for every state module. A state without
  tests is not officially supported.
- **No proprietary dependencies.** Everything must be installable
  from the language's public package registry under a
  permissive license (MIT/BSD/Apache compatible).
- **Reproducible builds.** Pin every dependency; pin every
  upstream data version.

## Operational shortcuts (production + dev tooling)

Things future sessions repeatedly rediscover; pin them here.

### Format / lint locally (don't bounce off the prod container)

The production container ships without ruff (intentionally — minimal
runtime image). Don't burn 30s per check via
`docker exec ... pip install ruff` round-trips. Install ruff on the
host once — version pinned to match `pyproject.toml` (`ruff = "^0.7"`):

```bash
pip install 'ruff>=0.7,<0.8'
```

Then format-check from the project root. Ruff auto-discovers
`pyproject.toml`'s `line-length = 100` setting, so no `--line-length`
flag needed:

```bash
ruff format --check src/opensalestax/core/lookup.py
ruff check src/opensalestax/core/lookup.py
```

`.pre-commit-config.yaml` already wires ruff + ruff-format. Run
`pre-commit install` once to auto-format every commit and skip the
manual check entirely.

### Production VM (`opensalestax-01`)

- SSH alias: `opensalestax-01` (Proxmox VMID 906, 10.32.161.126)
- Project dir: `/home/ejosterberg/open-sales-tax`
- Containers (docker compose): `open-sales-tax-api-1`,
  `open-sales-tax-postgres-1`
- Postgres user: `opensalestax` (not `postgres`); DB:
  `opensalestax`. Sample query:
  ```bash
  ssh opensalestax-01 "docker exec open-sales-tax-postgres-1 \
    psql -U opensalestax opensalestax -c \"SELECT ...\""
  ```

### CLI commands

The data-loader CLI uses `-s STATE -v VERSION` (NOT `--only`):

```bash
docker exec open-sales-tax-api-1 python -m opensalestax data load -s MO -v v0.55.4
docker exec open-sales-tax-api-1 python -m opensalestax data load-zcta \
  --cache-dir /var/lib/opensalestax/data
```

`load-zcta` reloads ALL Census ZCTA boundaries (~33,801 rows). Run
this whenever `src/opensalestax/data/zcta_loader.py` changes shape.

### Deploy loop (after a fix is committed and pushed)

```bash
ssh opensalestax-01 "cd /home/ejosterberg/open-sales-tax && \
  git pull --ff-only origin main && \
  docker compose build api && \
  docker compose up -d --force-recreate api"
```

The api image is a dev build with src bind-mounted from the repo;
build is fast (<60s once layers cache). If only the lookup logic
changed (no data shape change), no `data load` is needed.

### Brittle test-count pins (bumps required when adding cities)

Several state test files pin the exact count of city / rate dicts
(``assert len(CA_CITIES) == 218``, ``assert len(FL_CITIES) == 37``,
``assert len(NY_CITIES) == 30``). The intent is to force a
maintainer to update the docstring narrative explaining each new
addition. The cost: any iter that adds even one city must also
bump the pin, or CI fails.

When adding to a state's CITIES dict, ALSO update the
corresponding ``assert len(...) == N`` pin in the matching
``tests/unit/test_state_<state>.py`` file. The pins live in tests
named like ``test_<state>_seeds_<count>_cities`` and follow a
``[docstring with iter history] + [assertion]`` structure.

If iter-172 + iter-185 are any indication, this is the #1 cause of
CI failures from autonomous batches. Always grep for
``assert len(<NAME>)`` after editing a CITIES / RATE_PCT dict.

### Cross-state ZIP dedup (iter-165..168, RESOLVED)

The ZCTA loader picks each ZIP's canonical state by **summed
`AREALAND_PART` area majority** (not row count). The lookup engine
defers to the ZCTA-sourced DataVersion (source LIKE `zcta%`) for
the canonical state and filters out authorities from any other
state. If a future bug returns rates from a wrong state, check:

1. `_canonical_state_for_zip` returns the right abbrev for the ZIP
2. The ZCTA boundary's parent DataVersion source is still `zcta%`
3. The ZCTA loader's `_COL_AREALAND_PART = 16` still matches the
   Census file column layout

### MO multi-county cities pattern (iter-170)

KCMO straddles 4 counties. Each county-side of the same city is a
separate `MO_CITIES` entry (`"Kansas City"` for Jackson side,
`"Kansas City (Clay)"` for Clay side). The MO parser uses the
entry's county_name to anchor the city binding to that county only.
Apply the same pattern for any future multi-county city in MO/elsewhere.

## Quality pipeline (mandatory before "done")

Per Eric's global standards:

1. **Tests pass** for every state module touched
2. **Security review** for any new endpoint (input validation,
   rate limiting, auth where applicable)
3. **Conventions check** against the constitution
4. **Self-verification** — actually run the calculation against
   known good answers (the SST publishes test fixtures)

## Git / hosting

Like Eric's other projects: **GitHub** at
[ejosterberg/open-sales-tax](https://github.com/ejosterberg/open-sales-tax),
migrating to Eric's self-hosted GitLab CE if/when his GitLab
migration finishes (see `~/.claude/future-tasks.md`).

**Domains:** Eric owns both `opensalestax.org` (intended for the
OSS project site) and `opensalestax.com` (reserved for the
eventual hosted SaaS). Registered 2026-05-03.

**Local clone path on Eric's machine:** the directory is
`C:\Users\ejosterberg\Documents\GITprojects\sales_tax_api_service\`
(not renamed when the GitHub repo became `open-sales-tax`). The
local path doesn't have to match the repo name; references in code
and docs use the repo name `open-sales-tax`.

## What NOT to do

- **Don't pick the stack without asking Eric.** Propose; he decides.
  (Stack settled 2026-05-02: Python 3.11+ + FastAPI. Database
  pending Eric's confirmation on dual MariaDB+PostgreSQL plan.)
- **Don't import paid datasets.** Free public data only — that's
  the whole point of the project.
- **Don't ship a single state in isolation.** The architecture
  must support N states from day one even if only 1-2 land in
  Phase 1.
- **Don't make it impossible to self-host.** Cloud-only would
  defeat the OSS purpose.
- **Don't promise legal/tax advice.** This is a calculation
  engine; users are responsible for compliance. Disclaim clearly.
- **Don't reverse-engineer commercial sales-tax APIs** (Avalara,
  Vertex, Sovos, TaxJar, TaxCloud) to derive algorithms, schemas,
  or data structures. Implement from primary sources only — tax
  law, SST documentation, state DOR publications. Reading their
  public docs to understand "what tax software does" is fine;
  copying their request/response shapes or proprietary methods is
  not. See constitution §2 (patent risk acknowledgment).
- **Don't name features after commercial products.** No
  `/v1/avatax-compatible/...`, no "TaxCloud-style certification."
  Use generic functional names — they're more accurate and avoid
  trademark/patent provocations.
- **Don't accept commits without DCO sign-off** (`git commit -s`).
  CI enforces this; don't bypass. Constitution §14.
