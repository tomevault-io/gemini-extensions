# Agent Instructions

This file provides guidance to AI assistants when working with code in this repository.

## General useful for debug loops:
- The Claude Code tool is helpful to analyze large logs or do complex file edits.
- Pipe scripts that output lots of logs into a file for easier reading.
- Use AppleScript to execute apps such as Claude Code to test the mcp.
(This requires that the mcp is correctly set up)
- Whenever you want to ask something to the user, ask Claude Code first instead.
- Use AppleScript to find the bundle identifier for an app name
- Use `jq` to analyze large json files.
- We do not need backward compatibility, refactor properly.
- We use Swift 6 for the CLI.

- When I say "regenerate" then use `./scripts/generate-xcproj.sh` to regen the xcodeproj and use `xcodebuild` to test that it builds.
- "fix build" means using `xcodebuild` with `CodeLooper.xcodeproj`. When you added/removed/changed files, regenerate first.
- You don't need to regenerate the Xcode project as long as you just make modifications in one file. You only need to do this if you add or remove files. 

## Project Overview

This is the **CodeLooper** project, a Swift macOS menu bar application that provides automation and workflow enhancement capabilities. The application focuses on:

- Menu bar presence with status icon management
- User settings and preferences management  
- macOS accessibility automation via AXorcist integration
- Comprehensive logging and diagnostics system
- SwiftUI-based settings interface with AppKit foundation
- AXorcist is based on C-API that is synchronous and main-thread only. Therefore basically nothing in there should use async.
- Refactor and improve code while you fix up things, don't go for the easy route, do it properly.

## Architecture

- **Swift Package Manager (SPM)**: Primary dependency management and build system
- **Tuist**: Project generation and workspace management. Tuist uses a `Project.swift` manifest file to define the project structure, dependencies, and build settings. The main project configuration can be found in `Project.swift` at the root of the repository.
- **SwiftUI + AppKit**: Hybrid UI approach with SwiftUI for modern components and AppKit for system integration
- **AXorcist Integration**: Accessibility automation framework (git submodule)
- **Swift 6.0**: Strict concurrency checking enabled

### Key Directories

- **`Sources/Application/`**: Core app lifecycle, delegates, and coordination
  - `AppDelegate.swift`: Main application delegate with menu management
  - `AppMain.swift`: Application entry point and setup
  - `WindowPositionManager.swift`: Window management utilities
- **`Sources/Components/`**: UI components and SwiftUI views
  - `SwiftUI/`: Modern SwiftUI-based interface components
  - `Alert/`: Alert presentation system
- **`Sources/Diagnostics/`**: Comprehensive logging and error handling
  - `Logger.swift`: Main logging interface
  - `DiagnosticsLogger.swift`: Advanced diagnostic capabilities
  - `LogManager.swift`: Log configuration and management
- **`Sources/Settings/`**: User preferences and configuration
  - `Models/DefaultsManager.swift`: UserDefaults management
  - `Views/`: Settings UI components
- **`Sources/StatusBar/`**: Menu bar interface and icon management
  - `MenuManager.swift`: Main menu coordination
  - `StatusIcon/`: Icon animation and state management
- **`Sources/Utilities/`**: Shared utilities, extensions, and helpers
  - `Extensions/`: Swift and Foundation extensions
  - `Resources/`: Resource loading and management
- **`AXorcist/`**: Accessibility automation framework (git submodule)

## Development Workflow

### Essential Commands

```bash
# Project setup and building
swift build                           # Build with SPM (less common for day-to-day Xcode work)
./scripts/generate-xcproj.sh         # CRITICAL: Generate/regenerate Xcode project via Tuist. ALWAYS use this script.
                                      # This script includes vital patches for Swift 6 Sendable compliance with Tuist-generated code.
./scripts/open-xcode.sh             # Open in Xcode (use after generating project)
./scripts/run-app.sh                # Run the application (preferably from Xcode after project generation)

# Code quality and formatting
./run-swiftlint.sh                  # Check code quality (preserves self. references)
./run-swiftformat.sh                # Format code automatically
swift test                          # Run unit tests

# AXorcist accessibility testing
cd AXorcist && swift build          # Build accessibility tools
./AXorcist/.build/debug/axorc --help # Test accessibility CLI
```

### Tuist Project Generation

Due to Swift 6's strict concurrency checking and how Tuist generates code (specifically for Plist constants like `cfBundleURLTypes`),
**it is essential to always use the `./scripts/generate-xcproj.sh` script to generate or regenerate the Xcode project.**

This script performs the following crucial steps:
1. Runs `tuist generate` to create the base Xcode project.
2. **Applies necessary patches** to Tuist-generated Swift files (e.g., `Derived/Sources/TuistPlists+CodeLooper.swift`).
   These patches modify the generated code to ensure Sendable compliance, for instance by:
    - Adjusting types (e.g., from `[[String: String]]` to `[[String: Any]]` for `cfBundleURLTypes`).
    - Potentially adding `nonisolated(unsafe)` to static properties that use non-Sendable types if Tuist generation doesn't handle it.

**Failure to use this script will likely result in build errors related to Sendable compliance or incorrect type definitions in the generated Xcode project.**
If you encounter build errors related to `TuistPlists+CodeLooper.swift` or Sendable types in generated code, ensure you have run `./scripts/generate-xcproj.sh` most recently.

### Git Workflow
- **Main Branch**: `main` (default for PRs)
- **AXorcist Submodule**: Located at `AXorcist/`, requires separate git operations
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions with macOS runners for automated builds and tests

## Code Quality Standards

### SwiftLint Configuration (CRITICAL)
- **Explicit `self.` References**: The `redundant_self` rule is **disabled** to preserve explicit `self.` references required for Swift 6 concurrency compliance
- **Never remove** `self.` references in closures - they're required for capture semantics

### Swift 6 Concurrency Compliance
- Use `@MainActor` for UI-related classes and methods
- Add explicit `self.` in closures: `logger.info("Value: \(self.propertyName)")`
- Handle `Sendable` conformance properly with custom types
- Prefer structured concurrency (`async`/`await`) over completion handlers

### Naming and Style
- Descriptive variable names: `frameIndex` not `i`, `xPosition` not `x`
- Clear function names that describe intent
- Consistent indentation (4 spaces, configured in SwiftLint)
- Use `// MARK:` comments for code organization

## Diagnostic and Logging System

### Logger Usage Patterns
```swift
import Diagnostics

private let logger = Logger(category: .statusBar)

// Standard logging
logger.info("Menu bar icon updated successfully")
logger.warning("Icon animation may be slow on this system")
logger.error("Failed to load icon resource: \(error)")

// Structured logging with context
logger.debug("Processing menu update", metadata: [
    "itemCount": "\(items.count)",
    "hasIcons": "\(hasIcons)"
])
```

### Available Log Categories
- `.application`: App lifecycle and coordination
- `.ui`: User interface components
- `.network`: Network operations (if any)
- `.diagnostics`: Logging system itself
- `.statusBar`: Menu bar and icon management

## AXorcist Integration

### Accessibility Framework
- **Purpose**: macOS UI automation via accessibility APIs
- **CLI Tool**: `axorc` for JSON-based automation
- **Library**: Swift package integration for programmatic use
- **Permissions**: Requires macOS Accessibility permissions

### Common Usage Patterns
```bash
# Test accessibility connection
./AXorcist/.build/debug/axorc '{"command_id":"test","command":"ping"}'

# Query UI elements
./AXorcist/.build/debug/axorc --debug '{"command":"query","application":"com.apple.finder","locator":{"criteria":{"AXRole":"AXWindow"}}}'
```

## Agent Operational Guidelines

### Code Modification Workflow
1. **Always run SwiftLint** after any code changes: `./run-swiftlint.sh`
2. **Preserve explicit `self.` references** in closures (critical for Swift 6)
3. **Use TodoWrite tool** to track multi-step tasks and maintain visibility
4. **Read existing code patterns** before implementing new features
5. **Test build success** with `swift build` before considering changes complete

### Common Debugging Strategies
- **Enable verbose logging**: Use `logger.debug()` extensively during development
- **Check AXorcist integration**: Test accessibility features with the CLI tool
- **Use Xcode Instruments**: Profile performance for UI responsiveness
- **Verify permissions**: Ensure accessibility permissions are granted for automation features

### File Organization Principles
- Place new Swift files in appropriate `Sources/` subdirectories based on functionality
- Use clear, descriptive file names that indicate purpose
- Include proper import statements (minimize dependencies)
- Follow existing architectural patterns within each module

### Before Submitting Changes
1. **SwiftLint compliance**: `./run-swiftlint.sh` (must show no errors)
2. **Code formatting**: `./run-swiftformat.sh` (consistent style)
3. **Build verification**: `swift build` (must succeed)
4. **Functional testing**: Manual verification of UI changes
5. **AXorcist testing**: Verify accessibility integration if modified

## Security and Performance

### Security Considerations
- Never commit secrets, API keys, or sensitive configuration
- Use macOS Keychain for secure credential storage
- Validate all user inputs, especially from accessibility automation
- Follow principle of least privilege for system permissions

### Performance Guidelines
- Use lazy initialization for expensive resources
- Avoid blocking the main thread (use background queues)
- Profile memory usage with Instruments for menu bar efficiency
- Cache frequently accessed resources (icons, preferences)

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Located in `Tests/` directory using XCTest framework
- **AXorcist Tests**: Use `./AXorcist/run_tests.sh` for accessibility testing
- **Manual Testing**: Essential for UI components and menu bar behavior
- **CI Testing**: Automated via GitHub Actions on macOS runners

This guide ensures consistent, high-quality development that aligns with the project's architectural principles and quality standards.
