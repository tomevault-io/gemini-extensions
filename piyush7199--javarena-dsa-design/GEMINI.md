# Javarena DSA & Design - Cursor Rules

## Project Overview
This is a comprehensive Java-based repository for Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) and system design patterns, organized for interview preparation targeting FAANG companies.

---

## Code Style & Conventions

### Java Naming Conventions
- **Classes**: PascalCase (e.g., `BinarySearch`, `DynamicProgramming`)
- **Methods**: camelCase (e.g., `findMedian`, `longestSubstring`)
- **Variables**: camelCase (e.g., `maxLength`, `leftPointer`)
- **Constants**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `MAX_SIZE`, `DEFAULT_CAPACITY`)
- **Packages**: lowercase (e.g., `com.javarena.dsa.algorithms`)

### File Organization
- One public class per file
- File name must match the public class name
- Group related problem solutions in the same package
- Keep utility/helper classes in separate files if reusable

---

## Documentation Standards ⭐ STANDARDIZED FORMAT

### Class-Level Documentation (ENFORCED ACROSS 238 FILES)

Every class MUST have JavaDoc with EXACTLY these 3 sections:

```java
/**
 * [Problem Name]
 *
 * <p><b>Problem Statement:</b><br>
 * [Clear, concise description of what needs to be solved]
 *
 * <p><b>Intuition & Approach:</b><br>
 * [Core insights and strategy]
 * - Key observations
 * - Why this approach works
 * - Algorithm steps
 * - Alternative approaches (if applicable)
 *
 * <p><b>Time Complexity:</b> O(...) - [Explanation]
 * <br><b>Space Complexity:</b> O(...) - [Explanation]
 */
```

**CRITICAL:** Do NOT include:
- ❌ Problem links (belong in READMEs)
- ❌ Examples (belong in READMEs)
- ❌ Company names (belong in company/*.md files)
- ❌ Difficulty tags (belong in READMEs)
- ❌ Topic tags (belong in READMEs)
- ❌ Edge case sections
- ❌ @see references

### Method-Level Documentation
Each public method should have:
- Brief description of what it does
- @param tags for all parameters
- @return tag for return value
- Time and space complexity as inline comments

### Inline Comments
- Explain complex logic or non-obvious optimizations
- Add comments for algorithm steps
- Use TODO/FIXME/NOTE where appropriate

### Company-Wise Problems (`src/main/java/com/javarena/dsa/companies/`)
- Each company has a dedicated markdown file
- Format: `CompanyName.md`
- Track problems by company for targeted preparation

---

## Adding New Problems

### Step 1: Choose the Right Directory
- Identify the primary technique/data structure used
- Place in the most specific applicable directory
- If multiple techniques apply, choose the primary one

### Step 2: Create the File (Use STANDARD FORMAT)
```java
package com.javarena.dsa.algorithms.category;

/**
 * Problem Name
 *
 * <p><b>Problem Statement:</b><br>
 * [Clear description of what needs to be solved]
 *
 * <p><b>Intuition & Approach:</b><br>
 * [Core insight and strategy]
 * - Key observations
 * - Why this approach works
 * - Algorithm steps
 *
 * <p><b>Time Complexity:</b> O(...) - [Explanation]
 * <br><b>Space Complexity:</b> O(...) - [Explanation]
 */
public class ProblemName {
    /**
     * Main solution method.
     *
     * @param param1 description
     * @return result description
     */
    public ReturnType solutionMethod(ParamType param1) {
        // Implementation
        return result;
    }
}
```

### Step 3: Update Documentation
- Add problem to the appropriate README.md
- Include: problem number, name, link, solution file, difficulty
- Update company markdown file if applicable
- Follow the existing table format

### Step 4: Add Tests (Optional but Recommended)
- Create corresponding test file in `src/test/java/`
- Include edge cases and common test scenarios
- Use meaningful test method names

---

---

## Testing

### What to Test
- Edge cases (empty arrays, null inputs, etc.)
- Boundary conditions (min/max values)
- Common scenarios
- Large input sizes (if relevant)

### Test Naming
```java
@Test
public void testMethodName_scenario_expectedBehavior() {
    // Test implementation
}
```

```java
@Test
public void testBinarySearch_elementExists_returnsCorrectIndex() {
    // Test
}
```

---

import java.util.*;

/**
 * Complete class-level JavaDoc here
 */
public class ProblemName {
    
    // Constants (if any)
    private static final int MAX_VALUE = 1000;
    
    // Main solution method

### Common Patterns to Follow

#### Pattern 1: Problem with Multiple Approaches

```java
/**
 * [Problem documentation with ALL sections]
 */
public class Problem {
    
    /**
     * Optimal approach using [technique]
     * @return result
     */
    public int optimal(int[] arr) {
        // Optimal implementation
    }
    
    /**
     * Brute force approach for comparison
     * 
     * <p><b>Time:</b> O(n²) vs O(n) in optimal
     * <br><b>Space:</b> O(1)
     * <br><b>Trade-off:</b> Easier to understand but slower
     * 
     * @return result
     */
    public int bruteForce(int[] arr) {
        // Brute force implementation
    }
}
```

#### Pattern 2: Problem with Helper Class/Structure

```java
/**
 * [Main problem documentation]
 */
public class Problem {
    
    /**
     * Helper class to store [purpose]
     */
    private static class Helper {
        int field1;
        int field2;
        
        Helper(int f1, int f2) {
            this.field1 = f1;
            this.field2 = f2;
        }
    }
    
    // Main implementation using Helper
}
```

### Examples of Good vs Bad

#### ❌ Bad - Insufficient Documentation

```java
public class TwoSum {
    // Find two numbers that add up to target
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            int complement = target - nums[i];
            if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
                return new int[]{map.get(complement), i};
            }
            map.put(nums[i], i);
        }
        return new int[]{};
    }
}
```

#### ✅ Good - STANDARD COMPLIANT Format

```java
package com.javarena.dsa.datastructures.arrays;

import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

/**
 * Two Sum
 *
 * <p><b>Problem Statement:</b><br>
 * Given array of integers nums and integer target, return indices of two numbers
 * that add up to target. Each input has exactly one solution, cannot use same element twice.
 *
 * <p><b>Intuition & Approach:</b><br>
 * Hash map for O(n) single-pass solution:
 * - Store numbers and their indices in hash map as we iterate
 * - For each number, calculate complement = target - current
 * - If complement exists in map, we found the pair
 * - Otherwise, add current number to map and continue
 * 
 * Key insight: Avoid O(n²) nested loops by using O(1) hash map lookups.
 * Trade-off: Use O(n) extra space for O(n) time improvement.
 * 
 * Alternative: Two-pointer on sorted array (modifies input, returns values not indices).
 *
 * <p><b>Time Complexity:</b> O(N) - Single pass, hash map operations O(1)
 * <br><b>Space Complexity:</b> O(N) - Store up to n elements in hash map
 */
public class TwoSum {
    
    /**
     * Finds two indices that sum to target using hash map.
     *
     * @param nums array of integers to search
     * @param target the target sum to find
     * @return array containing two indices [i, j] where nums[i] + nums[j] == target
     */
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> numToIndex = new HashMap<>();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            int complement = target - nums[i];
            
            if (numToIndex.containsKey(complement)) {
                return new int[]{numToIndex.get(complement), i};
            }
            
            numToIndex.put(nums[i], i);
        }
        
        return new int[]{};
    }
    
    /**
     * Brute force approach - for learning and comparison.
     * 
     * <p><b>Time:</b> O(N²) - Nested loops

     *
     * @param nums array of integers

    public int[] twoSumBruteForce(int[] nums, int target) {
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < nums.length; j++) {
                if (nums[i] + nums[j] == target) {
                    return new int[]{i, j};
                }
            }
        }
        return new int[]{};
    }
}
```
