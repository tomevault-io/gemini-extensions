Read this first. It's the git + regen + test workflow that keeps agent edits safe and
reviewable. For the *quality bar* (what a good change looks like) read `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

---

## 1. Work in the checkout provided by the current environment

**Updated by Alaric's authorization, 2026-09-15:** Codex on Windows may read, edit,
regenerate, test, commit, and push directly from `C:\Users\alari\er-archipelago`.
This is a native Windows checkout, not the old Cowork filesystem mount. No Linux
sandbox, separate clone, or additional permission is required for routine work here.
Use the available native tools (PowerShell, git, Python, Cargo) and verify their
availability instead of applying historical sandbox limitations to this host.

- Inspect `git status`, the current branch, and remote state before editing. Preserve
  existing user changes; do not reset or overwrite them to make the tree clean.
- Work in one checkout for a change. Do not leave a draft in one working tree and
  push a different version from another. Use an isolated worktree when concurrency
  or conflicting local changes require it.
- Do not remove an index lock until you have established no live process owns it.
- If delegating work, identify the exact authorized checkout in each brief and
  re-verify load-bearing findings against that checkout.

The older Linux/Cowork recipes below apply only when actually running in that
sandbox. Their mount ban concerns `/sessions/*/mnt/er-archipelago` and similar
Cowork projections, **not this native Windows checkout**. In a Cowork session,
keep edits in the sandbox clone and transfer them through git; those mounts had
both stale-draft conflicts and observed truncated reads. Do not infer truncation
from ordinary native Windows reads or revert user files based on that old rule.

## 2. Which branch is live CHANGES — verify it, never trust this line

**`main` is the trunk on both repos.** But feature work does not always live there, and *this section
has been wrong twice*, in both directions:

- it once said "the active branch is `feat/matt-free-backbone-mvp`, NOT `main`" — by then that branch
  was 0 ahead of `main` and 36 behind, so following it checked you out onto a tree missing every
  recent commit;
- it was then corrected to a flat "`main` is the live branch, just clone and work on it" — which is
  what you are reading now, and it is **also** incomplete.

**Derived 2026-07-25 — a SNAPSHOT, not the answer. Re-run the commands below before you trust it:**

| repo | trunk | where live work is | note |
|---|---|---|---|
| `er-archipelago` (world) | `main` | **`main`** | `feat/natural-progression-mode` — named here as "live" on 07-24 — is now **0 ahead / 65 behind** `main`: merged and finished. No branch on origin holds live work (see below). Work on `main` |
| `from-software-archipelago-clients` (client) | `main` | `main` | push straight to `main`; that push is the Windows build gate (§4) |

Of the 26 non-`main` branches on the world origin, **21 are 0 ahead** (fully merged) and the other 5
carry 1-3 commits each while sitting 176-654 behind — stale scraps from July 8-21
(`agent/agents-md-client-note`, `agent/coverage-gate`, `agent/main-gate-grace-scadu-altus`,
`agent/surface-and-consumable`, `feat/spirit-ash-tiers`), not workplaces. Worth a skim before you
re-solve something, worth nothing as a base.

⚠️ **This table has now rotted three times, in three different directions:**
`feat/matt-free-backbone-mvp` (already dead when it was recommended) → a flat "`main` is the live
branch" (right trunk, wrong claim about where work happens) → `feat/natural-progression-mode` (true
the day it was written, merged two days later). Its half-life is about a week. **Derive, then read.**

So: **there is no standing answer to "which branch".** Do not read one out of this file. Derive it,
and if the repo state is ambiguous, ask Alaric — a wrong branch costs a whole session's work.

```bash
git ls-remote --heads origin | awk '{print $2}' | sort   # what actually exists, right now
# ahead/behind between trunk and a candidate branch (left = main-only, right = branch-only):
git fetch origin && git rev-list --left-right --count origin/main...origin/<branch>
```

> 🛑 **A `--depth N` clone makes `rev-list --left-right` LIE, silently.** The left-hand (main-only)
> number saturates at your clone depth, so on a `--depth 20` clone every branch reports exactly
> `20 <right>` and they all look equally divergent. It does not warn; it is a confident wrong number
> of precisely the kind CONTRIBUTING's "silent wrong answer" section is about. `git fetch --unshallow`
> before you measure, or don't shallow-clone at all. (Found the hard way, 2026-07-25.)

Read that output the way §7 wants you to read any derivation: a branch that is **0 ahead** of `main`
is a finished/merged branch and is not where work goes; a branch that is **behind** `main` needs a
rebase before you add to it. `origin/HEAD` may still point at a long-dead branch — ignore it.

(Rewritten 2026-07-24: the previous "`main` is the live branch" text was correct about the trunk and
wrong about where work happens, which is the same failure mode as the `feat/matt-free-backbone-mvp`
advice it replaced. The section is now a *procedure*, not a fact, because the fact keeps rotting.)

## 3. Session setup (sandbox is wiped between sessions — redo each time)

SSH to GitHub is blocked; use HTTPS + a fine-grained PAT (Alaric pastes one per session —
never save it to memory or a repo file):

```bash
printf 'https://x-access-token:%s@github.com\n' "$PAT" > /tmp/.gitcred; chmod 600 /tmp/.gitcred
git config --global credential.helper 'store --file=/tmp/.gitcred'
git config --global user.email 'alaric.mckenzie.boone@gmail.com'; git config --global user.name 'Alaric'
git clone --no-recurse-submodules https://github.com/4laric/er-archipelago.git ~/work/er-archipelago
cd ~/work/er-archipelago && git checkout <the branch you VERIFIED per §2>   # do NOT assume main
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/4laric/er-archipelago.git   # keep the token out of .git/config
git config core.hooksPath tools/hooks                                    # enable the truncation gate
```

Repo is ~83M; `--no-recurse-submodules` keeps it light.

**If you only need to READ or edit a file or two, do not clone 83M.** The sandbox `/` is disk-capped
and usually >95% full, and a second full clone can fail mid-way and leave an unremovable tree owned
by `nobody`. A blobless sparse clone is ~300K and pushes normally:

```bash
git clone --depth 1 --single-branch -b main --filter=blob:none --no-checkout \
    https://github.com/4laric/er-archipelago.git ~/work/er-doc
cd ~/work/er-doc && git sparse-checkout init --no-cone && git sparse-checkout set AGENTS.md
git checkout main
```
(2026-07-30: used exactly this to edit AGENTS.md when a full clone would not fit.)

## 4. The Rust client is a separate repo

The client lives in submodule `from-software-archipelago-clients` (crate
`eldenring-archipelago`), branch **`main`**. Clone it over HTTPS the same way.

⚠️ This section used to say **`eldenring-client-draft`**. That branch **no longer exists on origin** —
the client repo has only `main`. (Same correction as §2.)

### You do NOT have to hand every Rust change to Alaric to compile

This section used to say flatly "`cargo build`/`test` runs on Windows". **That is misleading**, and on
2026-07-11 it cost **three** build round-trips on nothing but wrong symbol names. Two ways to get a
compile check without touching the Windows box:

**1. CI is the cheap one — but ONLY on `main` or a PR. A side-branch push runs NOTHING.**

> ⚠️ **Corrected 2026-07-30.** The heading below used to read "it gates `push` to `main`" and the
> paragraph promised "a `.rs` push buys a full Windows build + test + fmt + clippy for free". True
> for `main`; **false for every other branch**, and the difference is invisible — a side-branch push
> succeeds, no run appears, and nothing says why. The triggers are `pull_request`, `push: [main]`,
> and `workflow_dispatch`, so for work on a branch **open the PR** and the `pull_request` trigger
> gives you the same four gates. Cost when missed: a green-looking push with no compile check at all.
`from-software-archipelago-clients/.github/workflows/test.yaml` runs on `windows-latest` on every
**push to `main`** (and `workflow_dispatch`), in this order: `cargo build`, then
`cargo test -p er-codec -p er-semver -p er-logic -p eldenring-archipelago`, then `cargo fmt -- --check`,
then `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` **and** `cargo clippy --features=profile -- -D warnings`. It used to
trigger on `pull_request` **only**, so pushes straight to `main` sailed past it; fixed 2026-07-11. So a
`.rs` push buys a full Windows build + test + fmt + clippy for free — a compile error, a broken test, a
format nit, or a clippy lint all come back red.
✅ **You CAN read that run from the agent sandbox — so READ IT.** (Corrected 2026-07-25; this block
used to say `api.github.com` "is not reachable here — it 502s through the egress proxy". It is
reachable, and for these PUBLIC repos an occasional read needs **no token**.)

⚠️ **Two API facts added 2026-07-30, both learned the expensive way:**
- **Unauthenticated reads RATE-LIMIT to 403 after roughly ten calls**, and a 403 here looks exactly
  like the "access not enabled" refusal below. Poll a run's status with
  `-H "Authorization: Bearer $PAT"` from the start and the ambiguity never arises.
- ⭐ **REST WRITES WORK with a PAT.** `POST /repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls` returned **HTTP 201** and
  opened a real PR from the sandbox. A 2026-07-23 note claimed every `api.github.com` write was
  403-gated by the egress proxy "REGARDLESS of the PAT", and that claim had already bought one
  hand-built PowerShell workaround. **Try the call before you build the workaround** (see rule 5,
  *RUN the tool, do not read it* — it applies to claims about the environment too, including the
  ones written in this file).

```bash
curl -s "https://api.github.com/repos/4laric/from-software-archipelago-clients/actions/runs?branch=main&per_page=3" \
  | python3 -c "import sys,json;[print(r['head_sha'][:7],r['status'],r['conclusion']) for r in json.load(sys.stdin)['workflow_runs']]"
```

That false claim has already cost a real bug: on 2026-07-25 `cargo fmt --check` was RED on client
`main` across four commits (`c128ba0`…`a32f685`) while the agent told Alaric "CI is the gate" and never
looked. Hand him the Actions link as well
(`https://github.com/4laric/from-software-archipelago-clients/actions?query=branch%3Amain`), but never
substitute the link for the check — and still reason about fmt/clippy before pushing. CI is a backstop,
not a replacement for thinking.

**2. Cross-compile from Linux — `xcompile-client-linux.sh` (repo root).**
It builds the real `eldenring_archipelago.dll` for `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` from a Linux host via
`cargo-xwin` (auto-downloads the MSVC CRT/SDK). Needs **sudo, ~4-5 GB free disk, and crates.io reachable**.
⚠️ The agent sandbox usually **cannot** run it — it is disk-capped (~9.6 GB, typically >95% used), so the
SDK download fails. Use it on a real Linux box / WSL2 / a CI runner. Pure-logic crates are host-native
and cheap either way: `cargo test -p er-codec -p er-semver -p er-logic`.

**2a. What the sandbox CAN and CANNOT build. `cargo` is absent, but you can INSTALL it — the
2026-07-24 "rustup is unreachable" finding was wrong, and the real blocker is `TMPDIR`.**
`cargo test -p er-logic` is the workhorse for anything decision-shaped (the whole replay tier lives
there, ~443 host tests, seconds to run). It is not preinstalled. `sudo` really is blocked
(no-new-privileges, so `apt-get install cargo` fails), but `sh.rustup.rs` is **reachable** — what
failed on 07-24 was `mktemp -d`, because `$TMPDIR` and `$HOME` both point at `/sessions/<session>/`,
which is a SHARED 9.8 GB volume that is routinely 100% full. rustup reports that as
`error: command failed: mktemp -d`, which reads like a network/permission failure and is not one.
Point everything at `/tmp` (a different device, `/dev/sda1`, usually with room) and it just works:

```bash
export TMPDIR=/tmp RUSTUP_HOME=/tmp/rustup CARGO_HOME=/tmp/cargo CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/tmp/ertarget
curl -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs -o /tmp/ru.sh
sh /tmp/ru.sh -y --profile minimal --default-toolchain stable --no-modify-path   # ~40s
export PATH=/tmp/cargo/bin:$PATH
cargo test -p er-logic          # + cargo fmt -p er-logic -- --check, cargo clippy ... -D warnings
```

⚠️ It is ~1.8 GB installed (toolchain 1.2 G + registry 0.5 G) against a ~2 GB budget on `/tmp`, so
you cannot hold it AND `greenfield/provision-linux-env.sh` at once. Do the Rust half first, then
`rm -rf /tmp/rustup /tmp/cargo` and provision the Python env (which also needs `HOME` and
`GF_CI_HOME` redirected off `/sessions`: `HOME=/tmp/gfhome GF_CI_HOME=/tmp/gfci bash
greenfield/provision-linux-env.sh`). Reinstalling rust later costs ~40s.

Run `command -v cargo` before you plan around it, and if you choose not to install it, say plainly
that the Rust side is UNVERIFIED here and let the Windows CI be the gate. Do not describe a test run
you could not perform. The
`eldenring-archipelago` and `shared` crates **never** build here (imgui / MSVC / detour deps); verify a
change to those by inspection plus, if the risk is a type or symbol name, a throwaway crate that
typechecks the call against the real dependency version (e.g. `windows 0.62.2`). Do not report an
un-built `eldenring-archipelago` change as "verified" — push it and let the Windows CI say so.

**3. READ THE PINNED CRATE SOURCE. It is right here, and this section used to say it wasn't.**

⚠️ **Corrected 2026-07-30.** This point read: *"The `eldenring` crate is **not vendored in the
sandbox**, so its type and method names are unknowable from there."* The second half is **false**, and
believing it meant guessing (or asking Alaric to paste) names that were sitting on disk the whole time.

Any `cargo build`/`test` in the client workspace populates `$CARGO_HOME/git/checkouts/`. With the §2a
env (`CARGO_HOME=/tmp/cargo`):

```bash
grep -A3 'name = "eldenring"' Cargo.lock          # get the pinned rev -- do NOT guess it
ls /tmp/cargo/git/checkouts/fromsoftware-rs-*/    # >1 rev can be present; pick the LOCKED one
sed -n '1,80p' /tmp/cargo/git/checkouts/fromsoftware-rs-*/<rev>/crates/eldenring/src/cs/item_id.rs
```

On 2026-07-30 this settled, in one session, four things that had been open, guessed, or wrong:

* `param_id_raw, set_param_id_raw: 27, 0` (`cs/item_id.rs:56`) — the CATEGORY-STRIPPED row. That
  discharged a `NOTE(windows-verify)` in `reconcile_io.rs` which had parked a double-mask alternative
  in a comment as "MUST CONFIRM ON WINDOWS with a set->readback". No Windows run was ever needed.
* `is_normal_items_full()` / `is_key_items_full()` / `is_multiplay_key_items_full()`, plus per-list
  `_len`/`_capacity` and `global_capacity` (`cs/player_game_data.rs:424-618`) — the game keeps its own
  inventory-fullness bookkeeping. Read it rather than inferring capacity from a scan.
* `key_items_accessor` vs `key_items_head` (`:444`, `:485`) — comparing the two pointers tells you at
  runtime whether the accessor has switched to the multiplay key list.
* `pub storage: Option<OwnedPtr<EquipInventoryData>>` (`:138`) — the storage box is reachable; the
  client just never reads it.

🛑 **Source-verified is NOT compiled, and the two are different words** (same rule as §5's
"static-validated" vs "regenerated"). A throwaway `cargo check` crate depending on `eldenring` still
FAILS on Linux — `windows-future 0.2.1` does not typecheck against the resolved `windows-core`, and
copying the client `Cargo.lock` does not fix it because the root package differs. So: source-verify
every field and method name you use (cheap, and strictly better than guessing), then let the Windows
CI be the compile gate, and **say which of the two you did.**

⭐ **BUT NOT EVERYTHING NEEDS WINDOWS, AND THE SANDBOX HAD BEEN SKIPPING WORK IT COULD DO.**
Measured 2026-08-16 while building the world#768 client half. Install the toolchain first —
`sh <(curl -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs) -y --profile minimal --no-modify-path`, then
`rustup component add rustfmt clippy` — and from a client clone:

| command | Linux sandbox | why |
|---|---|---|
| `cargo fmt -- --check` (**whole workspace**) | ✅ | rustfmt only PARSES. It never resolves a dependency, so the Windows crates format fine. |
| `cargo test -p er-logic` | ✅ | pure decision crate, 1188 tests |
| `cargo clippy -p er-logic` / `-p er-codec` / `-p er-semver` | ✅ | no `windows` dependency |
| `cargo clippy -p shared` / `-p archipelago-rs` | ❌ | pull the Windows tree in |
| anything touching `eldenring-archipelago` | ❌ | see above |

**`cargo fmt` is the one that matters**, because **CI's first gate is `cargo fmt -- --check` and it
runs BEFORE the compile.** A formatting slip therefore costs a full CI round-trip and tells you
nothing about whether your code compiles — which is exactly what happened on client PR #245. Run
`cargo fmt` before every client push; it is seconds, it needs no Windows, and it converts the most
common red run into a no-op.

So the honest split is three ways now, not two: **formatted** (local, free), **host-tested** (local,
for anything you can push into `er-logic` — and pushing the decision half down there is the point of
the `GameHook` seam), and **compiled** (Windows CI only). Say which of the three you did.

⚠️ **Disk.** A full `cargo` fetch of the Windows dependency tree exhausted the 9.8 GB sandbox volume
mid-resolve (`error: No space left on device`), so the `eldenring-archipelago` row above is "did not
complete here" rather than a confirmation of the `windows-future` diagnosis two paragraphs up — that
claim predates this table and was not re-verified. `cargo clean` and dropping
`~/.cargo/registry/cache` reclaims most of it.

**3b. Only if the name genuinely is not in the pinned source, ASK rather than guess.** Guessing is what
burned the three round-trips. Known-settled naming also lives in the module doc comments of
`check_lots.rs` / `enemy_drops.rs`:

```
eldenring::cs::ItemLotParam_map / ItemLotParam_enemy   (snake_case, not CamelCase)
eldenring::param::ITEMLOT_PARAM_ST                     (ONE row struct shared by BOTH lot tables)
row.set_lot_item_id01..08                              (no underscore before the digits)
use fromsoftware_shared::FromStatic;                   (required for SoloParamRepository::instance_mut)
```

You still need **Windows to RUN** the dll (it hooks a live Elden Ring process). Push your `.rs` fix to
client `main`. The world repo's CI checks the client out at its **own main** (not the pinned gitlink —
see `tests.yaml`), so your fix is exercised and the cross-repo generator gates run **without any
submodule bump**; a stale gitlink never reddens CI. The superproject gitlink is just a pin so a fresh
clone gets the matching DLL, and **`build.ps1 -Rust`/`-All` now auto-bumps it** (guarded: only when the
client submodule is clean, already on `origin/main`, and actually behind the pin — added 2026-07-20,
replacing the hand-run `git add from-software-archipelago-clients && git commit`). So do NOT tell Alaric
to bump it as boilerplate — his next `build.ps1` does it. Verify (see §7) and only mention it if it is
genuinely behind AND he has not re-run the build.

## 5. What you can run in-sandbox: the tests, and (since `gen_inputs.db`) the regen too

⚠️ **Re-corrected 2026-08-06 — the regen DOES run in-sandbox now, via `gen_inputs.db`.**
`tools/gen_inputs.py` (2026-07-27) postdates the 2026-07-24 correction below and was built to end
exactly this hand-off: the bundle carries every param CSV and FMG/EMEVD input `gen_data` reads,
verbatim, and it is **committed** (~9 MB). So:

```bash
python tools/gen_inputs.py --extract elden_ring_artifacts   # ~1450 files, ~98 MB
python greenfield/gen_data.py
```

**Prove it before you trust it: run that on an UNMODIFIED tree and require `git diff` to be empty.**
It was, on `47df8f2` — byte-identical to the committed output, which is what makes a sandbox regen
real rather than a fake one. If that diff is ever non-empty, your bundle and the committed modules
disagree and you must stop, not "fix" the diff.

Two things this does NOT change: the **MSBs are deliberately not in the bundle**, so the Tier-2 MSB
datamines in §5a still need the box; and the §1 mount ban is untouched — extract into the sandbox
clone, never symlink the mount.

⚠️ **Corrected 2026-07-24, and now superseded in part by the note above.** This section used to say
"You CAN regenerate + test the apworld in-sandbox" and told you to `ln -sfn <MOUNT>/elden_ring_artifacts …`
into the sandbox clone. **That half was wrong and stays wrong**: symlinking the mount violates the §1
ban outright (and a truncated mount read of a param CSV is a silent-wrong-answer machine). The other
half — "a full `gen_data.py` regen needs the FMG/EMEVD/MSB side of `elden_ring_artifacts/` that the
sandbox does not have" — was true when written and is no longer.

**The licensing-restricted game data is Windows-only and stays there.** It is never copied, never
symlinked, never committed (`.gitignore`d).

- **Regen runs in the sandbox** off `gen_inputs.db` (above), and in CI. `build.ps1 -Greenfield` /
  `-All` on Alaric's box remains the Windows path and the only one that covers §5a Tier 2. If you
  regenerated here, say **"regenerated in-sandbox from `gen_inputs.db`, clean-tree diff verified
  empty"** — that is a different claim from "static-validated" and from "needs a regen on your box",
  and all three are still different words. Never fake one.
- **A small param-CSV subset can be staged in the sandbox** for datamine-shaped static work; the tools
  that support it honour the `ER_ARTIFACTS_VV` env override (`tools/datamine_flag_lots.py`,
  `tools/gen_check_lots_table.py`). This is *opt-in staging for a specific investigation*, not a
  standing capability — assume it is absent unless you put it there this session.
- **Static validation is the sandbox ceiling** for anything artifact-derived: you can prove a
  grouping/predicate/shape claim against staged CSVs, and you must label it as static-validated when
  you hand it over. "Static-validated" and "regenerated" are different words; do not swap them.
- **The world's pytest suite DOES run here**, and should, on every Python change (below).

Test the world in-sandbox (provisions a Python-3.11 AP runtime under `~/.greenfield-ci`) — from the
repo root of your sandbox clone:

```bash
bash greenfield/provision-linux-env.sh        # once per session
AP=~/.greenfield-ci/ap; PY=~/.greenfield-ci/.venv/bin/python
rm -rf "$AP/worlds/eldenring"; cp -r greenfield/eldenring "$AP/worlds/eldenring"
cp greenfield/region_map.csv "$AP/worlds/eldenring/region_map.csv"   # gen INPUT the sweep-scoping oracle needs (else it skips)
cd "$AP" && AP_NONINTERACTIVE=1 SKIP_REQUIREMENTS_UPDATE=1 "$PY" -m pytest -q -p no:cacheprovider worlds/eldenring/tests/
```

**Retiring a check: `greenfield/tombstones.tsv` (issue #1521, 2026-09-25).** AP ids are positional
(`BASE_AP` + index into gen_data's `rows`), so deleting a row used to renumber every check after
it — 553 ids moved on a six-row removal, against ~20 hand-maintained tables, a feature module and
17 test files that pin ids. The ledger is APPEND-ONLY: one row per burned id (`ap_id`, `flag`,
`retired`, `reason`), and the positional walk skips each one, so the rows after a retired check
keep their ids. To retire a check: exclude its flag in `gen_data.py` (the usual `EXCLUDE_FLAGS`
classes) **and** append a tombstone carrying the ap id it HAD in the previous `data.py`, in the
same commit. gen_data FATALs if a tombstoned flag is still a live row, if an id is burned twice, or
if a tombstone sits past the end of the band; `data.TOMBSTONES` is emitted so the browser and the
contiguity test (`test_gf_data`) can account for the holes. Never reuse a burned id and never
delete a row from the ledger. It is a declared generator input (`gen_manifest.FILE_INPUTS`).

Generated files (`eldenring/tables/data.py`, `boss_data.py`, `boss_sweeps.py`, `region_open_flags.py`,
`item_ids.py`, `location_tags.py`, `region_play_ids.py`, …) all live in **`greenfield/eldenring/tables/`**
since #1464 — `core.py` reads them through `eldenring/table_loader.py` (`world.tables`), never by
import — and are **regenerated, never hand-edited** —
change `gen_data.py` and regen — **on Windows** (§5 above). The generator is deterministic, so the same
artifacts + generator byte-match wherever they run and the DATA DRIFT gate reconciles if they don't; that
is why committing regenerated data is fine when the regen was real. It is not a licence to produce one
here without the artifacts.

**Do NOT hand Alaric a per-file regen checklist.** On his box `build.ps1 -All` (⊃ `-Greenfield`) runs
the WHOLE deterministic regen: `gen-greenfield.ps1` → the datamine + `gen_data.py`, which rewrites
**every** `eldenring/*.py` generated module **and** re-blesses both stamp files (`_gen_stamp.json` +
each module's `_GEN_STAMP`), and it also regenerates the client's THREE cross-repo tables
(`tracker_regions.rs`, `contract_gen.rs`, and `region_locks.rs` — the last baked from the
`region_groups` spine via `tools/gen_region_locks.py`; it was omitted from `build.ps1` until
2026-07-17, so a `region_groups` change used to ship a stale client `region_locks.rs` until the
`test_gf_data` / `gen_region_locks --check` drift gate failed — now wired). So if your change touched a
GENERATOR or the region spine (`gen_data.py`, `region_groups.py`), say it **once** — "needs a
`-Greenfield`/`-All` regen on your box" — never a file-by-file "remember to regenerate X.py, re-bless
the stamps, rerun the tracker gen, …". He runs `-All`; it covers all of that. What you should NOT do is
claim the regen is already done: the artifacts are not here (§5), so the generated modules in your
commit are whatever the last real regen produced. Say "needs a `-Greenfield` on your box" once and stop.

> ⚠️ **A datamined `greenfield/*.tsv` is the EXCEPTION — `-All` does NOT regenerate it.** `gen_data`

### 5b. Standing up the AP env IN THE AGENT SANDBOX -- the recipe that actually works

`greenfield/provision-linux-env.sh` is the supported path and it is what to use on WSL2 or a real
box. **In the Cowork agent sandbox it does not finish**, for reasons that all look like something
else, so here is the working sequence and the trap behind each step. (Derived 2026-07-27; it ends
with `16 passed, 9766 subtests` on the AP-dependent half, so the whole pytest suite -- not just the
AP-free tier -- runs in-sandbox.)

⚠️ **Rewritten 2026-08-16.** The recipe below used to pin an **x86_64** tarball and stage everything
on `$O=/sessions/<session>/mnt/outputs`. Both were true of the sandbox it was derived in (2026-07-27)
and neither is portable: a Cowork session on an Apple-Silicon host gets an **aarch64** sandbox, where
the pinned tarball installs cleanly and then dies with `cannot execute binary file: Exec format
error` — which reads like a corrupt download, not a wrong architecture. Derive the arch; do not type
it.

```bash
W=~/work                                   # NOT the outputs mount -- see the traps below
ARCH=$(uname -m)                           # x86_64 | aarch64 -- DERIVE IT, the URL differs
# 1. Python 3.11 -- 3.10 IS NOT ENOUGH (AP 0.6.7 uses typing.Self in worlds/AutoWorld.py)

  $PY tools/gf_test.py --ap-dir _ap -q -p no:cacheprovider
```

**The traps, each of which reads as a different problem than it is:**

- 🛑 **Do NOT stage the toolchain on `$O=/sessions/<session>/mnt/outputs`.** Files written there
  become **un-removable and un-overwritable within the same session**: `rm -rf` returns `Operation
  not permitted` per file and a re-run of `tar` returns `Cannot open: Permission denied`. So a
  partial or wrong extract cannot be cleaned up or retried — and the old advice to extract with
  `--skip-old-files` "so re-running is resumable" makes it worse, because you cannot clear the bad
  tree it resumes onto. `~/work` is on the same `/sessions` volume, had 3.6 GB free, and behaves
  normally. (Observed 2026-08-16 while replacing an x86_64 extract with an aarch64 one.) Related:
  `/tmp` can hold files from a PREVIOUS session owned by `nobody` — a heredoc onto a name like
  `/tmp/pr.md` fails with `Permission denied` while a subsequent read of that path silently returns
  the **stale** contents. Write scratch files under `~/work/scratch`, not `/tmp`.
- 🛑 **Background jobs are REAPED when the launching bash call returns.** `nohup ... &` and
  `setsid ... &` both survive a `sleep` in the same call and are gone by the next one, leaving a
  truncated log and no process — which reads like a crash in the thing you launched. There is no
  "start the suite and poll it" here. The per-call ceiling is ~178 s, and the full world suite takes
  ~150 s of pytest plus install, so **split it**: `ls worlds/eldenring/tests/test_*.py >
  ~/work/scratch/all && split -n l/4 ~/work/scratch/all ~/work/scratch/batch_` and run the four
  batches in four calls (~40 s each). A green full run is 2421 passed / 97 skipped / ~439k subtests
  (2026-08-16, `main` @ `4c23d83d` + #723).
- 🛑 **`--ap-dir` must be INSIDE the repo, and should be `_ap`.** Two separate failures, one for each
  half:
  * **Outside the repo**, `tests/_util.find_repo_root` returns `None` — and while its docstring says
    "callers skip on None", `test_gf_arena_grace_exclusions` and `test_gf_arena_grace_load_bearing`
    do not: they `os.path.join(ROOT, ...)` at module scope and raise `TypeError: expected str, bytes
    or os.PathLike object, not NoneType` **during collection**, which aborts the whole run with 2
    errors and zero results.
  * **At `.ap-test`** — `gf_test.py`'s own default — `test_gf_regen_all.SKIP_DIRS` does not list it
    (it lists `_ap`, the CI name), so the walk scans the *installed copy* of the world and reports
    its generated modules as un-emitted orphans. One spurious red that reads exactly like #699/#708.
- 🛑 **Let `gf_test.py` install the world. A hand-rolled `cp` produces ~43 phantom failures.** The
  install copies every `greenfield/*.csv` and `*.tsv`, `region_groups.py`, `release/EldenRing.yaml`,
  the repo-root player guide and `release/KNOWN-ISSUES.md` — not just `REQUIRED_INPUTS`. Copy only
  the four `REQUIRED_INPUTS` and `bell_handins`, `key_item_gate_classification`, `shipping_yaml` and
  `player_guide` all go red with `FileNotFoundError` on ground-truth tables, which looks like real
  data corruption and is a missing `cp`. (Cost an hour on 2026-08-16, and produced a confidently
  wrong "43 pre-existing failures" claim in a PR body before it was caught.)
- ⚠️ **Clear `__pycache__` after moving or renaming the AP directory.** Cached `.pyc` files carry
  absolute paths, so a test that resolves a sibling module keeps loading the OLD location and fails
  citing a directory that no longer exists — `find . -name __pycache__ -prune -exec rm -rf {} +`.
- 🛑 **`TMPDIR` must be `/tmp` for pytest, and NOT on the outputs mount.** pytest's capture tmpfile
  vanishes there and you get `FileNotFoundError ... _pytest/capture.py:592 res = self.tmpfile.read()`
  at the END of a run -- which reads like a broken test, not a broken environment. (`HOME` and the
  pip/uv caches, by contrast, MUST be off `/sessions`, which is routinely 100% full -- same finding
  as the rustup `TMPDIR` note in §4. The two want opposite volumes; set them separately.)
- 🛑 **`uv python install 3.11` will not finish.** It downloads fine but then unpacks ~120 MB of
  small files onto the slow mount, and the per-call timeout kills it mid-extract leaving nothing
  behind. This looks like a network failure and is not one. Fetch the tarball with `curl` and
  extract it yourself. (The `-C -` / `--skip-old-files` "resumable" advice that used to live here
  applied to the outputs mount; off that mount the download is a few seconds and a clean
  `rm -rf && tar -xzf` is strictly better than resuming onto a tree you cannot inspect.)
- 🛑 **A full AP checkout will not finish either** (~3500 files). Sparse-checkout it — but use
  `--no-cone` with the pattern list above. ⚠️ **`init --cone` does NOT keep the root `.py` files**,
  whatever this doc used to say: it leaves you with `test/` and `worlds/` only, and you then chase
  `ModuleNotFoundError: BaseClasses` → `pathspec` → `rule_builder` one 45 s call at a time, each of
  which reads like a missing dependency rather than a missing checkout. `rule_builder/` is needed
  too (`worlds/AutoWorld.py` imports it) and is easy to miss. Some unrelated worlds
  then fail to import (`worlds.sm` wants `variaRandomizer`); AP logs it and carries on with the rest
  registered. Harmless -- do not chase it.
- ⚠️ Python **3.10 is present and will get you a long way in** before dying on `typing.Self`. Check
  `python3 -V` before assuming the sandbox python is usable.

With this up you can run the AP-dependent tests, `tools/fill_regression.py`, and -- once
`tools/gen_inputs.py --extract` has put the inputs in place -- `gen_data.py` itself. That is the
difference between handing Alaric a tool to run and handing him a result.

### 5a. TWO regen tiers — do not conflate them (the spurious-regen trap)

More than one agent has "fixed" a datamine, told Alaric to "just run `-All`", and shipped nothing —
because `-All` ran `gen_data` against the **stale** tsv. Others hand-edited a `--emit` output to fake
the fix, desyncing it from its tool. **CI catches neither** (the tsvs are tracked; the artifacts/MSBs
are absent in CI). Know which tier your change is in:

- **Tier 1 — automated by `build.ps1 -All`/`-Greenfield`, and by `tools/regen_all.py`.** The chain
  is `datamine_boss_drops.py` → `datamine_boss_healthbars.py` → `gen_data.py` (rewrites the
  `eldenring/*.py` modules **and writes `_GEN_STAMP`**) → the cross-repo tables (`gen_region_locks`,
  `gen_contract`, `gen_area_tiers --check`) → **the three offline pages + `questline_dag.tsv`**.
  A change in `gen_data.py`, `region_groups.py`, a boss-drop/healthbar input, or any
  `eldenring/*.py` consumer → **`-All` covers it. Say it once.**

  ⭐ **THE PAGES ARE NOT COMMITTED ANY MORE, AND THEY ARE NOT YOUR PROBLEM (2026-09-09).**
  `er-archipelago-check-browser.html`, `-evidence-browser.html`, `-desc-triage.html`,
  `-questline-dag.html` and `-region-second-opinion.html` are **gitignored**. `regen_all.py` still
  builds them into your working tree — build them, read them, that is what they are for — but they
  are never a diff, never in a commit, and **cannot conflict**. CI builds and publishes them:

  | when | where |
  |---|---|
  | push to `main` | <https://4laric.github.io/er-archipelago/> (`.github/workflows/pages.yaml`) |
  | pull request | the `offline-pages` artifact on that PR's `pages` run — download it to review a page |
  | a `v*` tag | release assets, which `tools/deploy_wizard.sh` installs on the public host |

  🛑 **THIS IS WHY THE OLD RULE IS GONE.** It read: *the pages EMBED `inputs_hash`, so any change
  that moves the stamp — including a comment edit to `gen_data.py`, which is `FILE_INPUTS[0]` —
  re-stales all of them, and the only thing that notices is CI's byte diff.* Both halves have been
  fixed rather than remembered:

  * the **stamp is narrow** now. Each page embeds a hash over exactly the files ITS builder reads
    (`gen_manifest.BUILDER_INPUTS`, same hashing function as the global one), so a comment edit to
    `gen_data.py` moves nothing. `test_gf_page_stamp_scope.py` proves that, and proves the
    converse — an edit to a declared input still moves that page's stamp;
  * the **pages are untracked**, so even a real move is a rebuild and not a merge conflict. The
    numbers that forced this: in the 60 commits before the change, the 30 MB evidence browser moved
    **37 times** and **26 of those 60 commits** were "merge origin/main" / "regenerate the pages"
    repair commits — every one of them a single-line JSON payload that three-way merge cannot touch.

  The byte-diff staleness gate is untouched for everything that IS still committed (the generated
  tables, the tsvs, the cross-repo Rust). It just has nothing to say about a file git does not store.

  🛑🛑🛑 **AGENTS: THE TIER-1 REGEN IS A PRECONDITION OF YOUR PR, NOT A HANDOFF.** §5 above says the
  regen runs in the sandbox off the committed `gen_inputs.db`; this is the rule that follows from it.
  If your branch touches `gen_data.py`, `region_groups.py`, `region_spine.py`, or any
  `gen_manifest.FILE_INPUTS` entry, **run the full chain and commit its output before opening the
  PR.** A "source half" PR whose description asks Alaric to regen is not a deliverable — `.ps1` is a
  convenience wrapper, not a platform requirement:

  ```bash
  python3 tools/regen_all.py     # THE regen. inputs -> datamines -> gen_data (+stamp) -> tables -> pages
  git status --short             # everything it lists is generated output that belongs in THIS commit
  ```

  **One command on purpose.** `tools/regen_all.py` holds the step list; `build.ps1` and the CI
  `generators` job invoke the same file, so this block cannot drift from what CI checks — which it
  had, silently, for as long as the pages have been stamped. `python3 tools/regen_all.py --list`
  prints the steps and runs nothing. Sandbox-safe: the client-dependent steps SKIP loudly when the
  submodule is absent, and `--phases modules,pages` narrows it if you know what you are doing.
  `greenfield/eldenring/tests/test_gf_regen_all.py` is the gate that keeps the list complete — it
  goes red if a stamp-bearing artifact, or a `tools/build_*.py` that writes a root page, is not
  reachable from the entrypoint.

  🛑 **Order, not taste: the stamp is written and THEN read.** Finish every source edit first
  (`gen_data.py` is a declared input — a *comment* re-stales it), then run the entrypoint once.
  Rebuilding a page before the stamp leaves it carrying the previous hash, which is a red CI diff
  with no visible cause; it cost six rounds on world PR #481.

  **Why this is a rule and not advice (PR #526, 2026-08-10).** A region merge shipped as a source
  half, merged, and left `main` unable to regen. The regen was the only thing that would have found
  the tail: `MAJOR_BOSS_EXTRAS` and `features/legacy_key_gates` were still keyed on the folded region
  name, plus six test files. ⭐ **A region rename/merge has a source tail that grep does not find,**
  because the references are data keys in tables you did not think to open — and since every one is a
  `raise SystemExit`, **an aborting gate hides the next**, so they surface one per run. Budget 3–4
  regen loops for a region change and spend them before pushing, not one per CI round-trip.

- **Tier 2 — MANUAL, never in any `.ps1`.** The tracked `greenfield/*.tsv` tables are `gen_data`
  **inputs**, each emitted by its own datamine tool, run by hand — several need the unpacked witchy'd
  MSBs the build never touches. If your fix's root is one of these, run that tool's `--emit` yourself,
  **commit the regenerated tsv**, and only THEN does `-All` (via `gen_data`) pick it up. **Order is
  emit → gen_data, not the reverse**, and both land in the SAME commit.

  | tracked table | emitted by | needs |
  |---|---|---|
  | `grace_ground.tsv` | `tools/datamine_grace_ground.py --emit` | witchy'd m60/m61 **+ interior** MSBs |
  | `arena_graces.tsv` | `tools/datamine_arena_graces.py` | witchy'd MSBs |
  | `grace_names.tsv` | `tools/datamine_grace_names.py` | params / msgbnd |
  | `grace_flags.tsv`, `grace_region_map.tsv` | `tools/regen_grace_tables.py` | `BonfireWarpParam` |
  | `play_region_buckets.tsv` | `tools/datamine_play_regions.py` | `PlayRegionParam` |
  | `item_grace_coords.tsv` | `tools/datamine_item_grace_coords.py` | MSBs / params |
  | `dungeon_regions.tsv` | `tools/datamine_dungeon_regions.py` | committed grace tsvs |
  | `msb_flag_region.tsv` | `tools/datamine_msb_item_regions.py` | witchy'd MSBs |
  | `nearest_grace.tsv`, `tile_grace.tsv` | `tools/build_nearest_grace.py --extra-coords greenfield/boss_reward_coords.tsv`, `tools/build_tile_grace.py` | committed grace tsvs (sandbox-runnable) |
  | `shop_rows.tsv` | `tools/datamine_shop_rows.py` | params |
  | `synthetic_flag_recovery.tsv` | `tools/recover_synthetic_flags.py` | committed tsvs |
  | `sweep_trigger_npcs.tsv` | `tools/datamine_sweep_trigger_npcs.py` | event js + msg FMG + params (#713) |

  If you **can't** run the MSB-gated tool in-sandbox (no unpacked MSBs here), say so plainly and hand
  Alaric the exact `--emit` command **and** the emit → `-All` order — never imply `-All` covers it.
  If you **can** (MSBs staged / a sandbox-runnable tool), emit it here and commit the fresh tsv so
  the tree is self-consistent. Never hand-edit a `--emit` output to nudge one row; re-emit the whole file.

### Datamine joins that work in the sandbox
- **Item-lot flag → map:** the flag encodes it — `X0SS7000` = map `mX_SS` (e.g. `40017000` = `m40_01`).
- **Map/sub-dungeon → region:** join `grace_flags.tsv` (mapTile→warp) → `grace_region_map*.tsv`
  (warp→play_region) → `REGION_ID_MAP.md` (play_region→region). Use this instead of MSBs —
  `soulstruct` is **Oodle-blocked** on packed `.msb.dcx` (the Oodle DLL is Windows-only).
- Decompiled EMEVD is greppable text at `elden_ring_artifacts/event/*.emevd.dcx.js`.
- **Reading the corpus by hand:** open
  <https://4laric.github.io/er-archipelago/er-archipelago-check-browser.html>, or build your own
  copy with `python3 tools/regen_all.py --phases pages` (root, no server, no artifacts). 🛑 **It is
  NOT in git** — it is built in CI and published (§5a). One offline page over all checks —
  full-text search plus facets for region, tag,
  map tile, and *property* (`missable`, `has lot gate`, `no map position`, `no nearest grace`,
  `shop row`), with per-check item lots, shop rows, gates, maps and nearest grace. Rebuild with
  **`python3 tools/regen_all.py`** (§5a) after any `gen_data.py` run — not the builder alone, which
  is how three stamped pages ended up with three different owners; it is AP-free and joins only
  committed greenfield data, so it can be rebuilt in the sandbox.
  `tests/test_gf_check_browser.py` gates totality/agreement/determinism.
  It is a **reader**, not an oracle: it shows what the world already declares, and any number it
  displays is a join over the same tsvs the generators use.
- **Gate evidence is PLURAL.** The browser joins all four corpora that document gating and counts
  them separately: `lot_gates` 110 · `treasure_enablers` 136 · `esd_gifts` 48 · `esd_gates` 405 —
  **union 684**, not 110. Each is rendered beside its own tsv header VERBATIM, one click away,
  because those headers carry the polarity rules: `EndIf` has INVERTED sense, `self_set_flags` is a
  MEMO not a prerequisite, and `NO_ENTITY_HANDLE` is *proof of no gating*, not mystery. 🛑 Never
  flatten a verdict to "gated: yes/no" — a test fails if you normalise the strings away. A check
  with nothing in all four is labelled **"absence of evidence across four tables"**, not "ungated"
  (the 5 Edgar checks read exactly this way — see the ObjAct third gate class).
- **Negative space.** The same page carries the join RESIDUALS — 450 rows that exist in a side
  table but are not checks (268 itemlot flags, 80 shop rows, 51 flagless ESD gift lots, 51 phantom
  verdicts). Search there before announcing a "missing check": that residual is where
  "~126 invisible lots" and "27 phantoms" both came from. A blank reason means **nobody recorded
  one** — an honest unknown, not an invitation to guess.
- **Map tab.** Plots the CURRENT FILTER on the committed browser maps, coloured by region, so a
  misregioned check is a colour outlier instead of a datamine and a tile-straddle question is "look
  at the border". 1930 of 4879 place; the header states the non-plottable interior count every
  time, because a map that quietly omits them implies spatial coverage the data lacks. Uses the
  same `world_xz` as the triage tool (one implementation, one test) and each map's OWN calibration
  — projecting DLC through the base transform puts every Shadow-Realm check in the sea, plausibly
  enough to be believed, so a test forbids it.
- **Diff a build.** Load an older `er-archipelago-check-browser.html`; it re-extracts that build's
  payload and reports what actually MOVED — checks added/removed, region changes, tag flips,
  name/description churn, nearest-grace churn — keyed by AP id, with both `inputs_hash` stamps
  shown. This is how you review a regen: the generated `.py` diffs run to thousands of unreadable
  lines. 🛑 **A REVIEW AID, NOT A GATE.** CI's byte-staleness check is the gate. If diff says
  "nothing changed" while the bytes changed, that is a FINDING, not a pass — and the page says so.
- **Permalinks.** Facets, query, sort and selection serialise into `location.hash`, so a handoff
  can cite `…#gate=enabler:%20NO_ENABLER&r=Limgrave` instead of pasting a list that rots. Reopening
  an old link against a newer build re-derives the number; if a filter term no longer matches
  anything the page shows a red banner saying so, rather than a quiet zero.

### QUESTLINE DAG — `er-archipelago-questline-dag.html`

The third stamped page, and until issue #699 it was named in **no** doc — not here, not in
CONTRIBUTING — which is precisely how PR #698 shipped it stale. `tools/build_questline_dag.py`
emits `greenfield/questline_dag.tsv` (SPEC-questline-dag tier 1: *emit the graph, assert nothing*)
and `tools/build_questline_dag_page.py` renders it as one mermaid graph per connected component —
the unit of browsing is the CLUSTER, because the graph is 136 mostly-disjoint components, not one
DAG. Mermaid is fetched from a CDN at VIEW time, so the build is offline-safe and byte-deterministic.
Both ride `tools/regen_all.py`; the **tsv** is committed and the **page** is not (§5a) — read it at
<https://4laric.github.io/er-archipelago/er-archipelago-questline-dag.html> or build your own.
`tests/test_gf_questline_dag.py` gates the **tsv** (corroboration,
the SPEC §7 acceptance cases, freshness); `test_gf_regen_all.py` is what keeps the **page** from
falling out of the chain. 🛑 An edge is co-occurrence plus a polarity rule, not proof;
`sense=unknown` must not be reasoned with, and absence is not evidence of safety.

🛑 **A FOURTH CORPUS SINCE #1085, AND IT IS A HAND EMIT.** `greenfield/questline_conditions.tsv` is
produced by `tools/extract_questline_conditions.py --dag-corpus` from the decompiled EMEVD + talk
ESD (`python3 tools/gen_inputs.py --ensure elden_ring_artifacts`). Those artifacts are
licensing-restricted and absent from CI, so **no job re-emits this table** — same footing as
`greenfield/flag_names.tsv` and `--verify-commonarg` (§5). Re-run
`tools/extract_questline_conditions_fixtures.py` (nine acceptance fixtures, F1 = Fortissax) before
committing a new emit. The DAG builder treats the table as ABSENT-OK and says so in its header;
`test_gf_questline_dag.py` floors its edge count so an absent one cannot read as a clean tier-1 run.
The page does **not** draw those edges — a cone corpus collapses the graph into one unreadable
component — and says so in its banner with the count. See SPEC-questline-dag §9c.

### REGION SECOND OPINION — adjudicating the `(region unconfirmed)` checks

`er-archipelago-region-second-opinion.html` (built by `python3 tools/regen_all.py --phases pages`;
NOT committed — published at <https://4laric.github.io/er-archipelago/> — §5a)
is a **worksheet**, not a verdict. It renders `greenfield/check_region_second_opinion.tsv` — what
Eldenpedia (CC BY-SA 4.0) and the Fandom wiki (CC BY-SA 3.0) appear to say about each of the 305
checks whose region came from a nearest-neighbour hop — grouped DISAGREE → AMBIGUOUS → NO-DATA →
AGREE, with the 209 generic-name rows collapsed. Rule a row, add a note, and the page hands back a
`flag / ap_ids / audit_verdict / adjudication / note` TSV for `region_overrides.tsv`.

🛑 **THE ADJUDICATION UNIT IS THE FLAG.** Eight flags carry more than one ap id and `region_of`
decides per flag, so the page merges them into one row; ruling on one id and not its siblings
produces an override the table cannot express. 🛑 **NO-DATA is not AGREE** — a page was found and
never named a region — and 🛑 a **tile cluster is a hint, not a finding**: contiguous ground
legitimately shares one hop. Nothing in generation reads this page or its export.

### DESC-TRIAGE — authoring `location_descriptions.tsv`

`er-archipelago-desc-triage.html` (built by `python3 tools/regen_all.py --phases pages`; NOT
committed — published at <https://4laric.github.io/er-archipelago/> — §5a) ranks checks by how
badly they need a hand description and puts them **on the committed overworld maps**, because the
question you have to answer when writing one is "which of these four is this?" — MEASURED, 986
checks carry a `collision_ordinals()` "(N)" suffix across 306 families, meaning the waterfall could
not tell them apart. Pick a row, see it and its indistinguishable siblings plotted together, type
what makes it different, export a `flag<TAB>description` TSV to paste into
`greenfield/location_descriptions.tsv` (layer 1, always wins), then regenerate
(`python3 tools/regen_all.py`).

The need score is a **triage heuristic, not a truth claim**, and is rendered decomposed so you can
disagree per row: no item name +100, indistinguishable sibling +50, bare +25, machine locale +20,
coarse tile-grace +10, important tag +15, bulk filler −30.

**Overworld coordinate fold — the part to be careful with.** The 4th map-id field is
`[version][lod]`; LOD is documented (`tests/test_gf_lod_tile_regions.py`, `gen_data.py:177`).
Placement uses

    lod = int(suffix[1]) if a 4th field else (2 if tileX < 30 else 0)   # merchant ids are truncated
    pitch = 256 << lod
    world = tile*pitch + local + (pitch-256)/2

then `greenfield/maps/map_calibration*.json`. Two parts are **INFERRED, documented nowhere**: the
`(pitch-256)/2` centring term, and "3-field id + low tile = truncated LOD2" (merchant rows lose the
suffix in `datamine_merchant_shops._map_id`). Evidence for the centring term: without it all 18
LOD2 rows sit 244–463 m outside the tile their own flag encodes, and with it five coarse merchant
tiles land 50–122 m from a real named grace. `test_gf_desc_triage.py` pins it with hand-computed
cases and asserts every projected point lands inside its map — so if it is wrong, it is wrong
*visibly and consistently*, not silently. To falsify: check one of those five merchants in game.

**🛑 MEASURED AND KILLED 2026-07-27 — do not rebuild this.** When the full msg set landed,
`PlaceName` (1007 ids) × `WorldMapPointParam` (472 markers, 289 resolving to a real place name with
a position and a reveal flag) looked like the obvious way to upgrade the weak descriptors. It is
not, and the number is not close:

| | |
|---|---|
| weak-descriptor checks (bare 144 / machine-locale 181 / coarse "around" 656) | **982** |
| …of those, having ANY datamined coordinate | **80 (8%)** |
| …within 300 m of a named map point | **17 (2%)** |

**The ceiling is the CHECKS, not the map points.** 902 of the 982 have no position at all — they are
weak *because* they are unplaced, so no spatial source can reach them, and a better place-name
corpus changes nothing. Of the 80 that ARE placed, 17 do get a name (21% of the addressable set),
which is fine and worthless at that scale.

**🛑 AND THE MSB ROUTE IS ALSO DEAD — retracted 2026-07-27, same day I specced it.** The obvious
follow-up was "distil the missing positions out of the MSBs on the box". The measurement looked
compelling: 505 live checks are seen by `msb_flag_region` but have no coordinate, and 537 of the
546 missing rows are `source=event`. I read that as "the two datamines read different MSB record
types — one reads Event records, the other Treasure records" and wrote a spec plus a probe.

**Wrong, and `datamine_msb_item_regions.py`'s own docstring says so.** `source=event` does not mean
an MSB Event record. It means the map was attributed from **EMEVD** — those items are boss drops
and event awards that are *"NOT NpcParam drops and NOT map Treasures"* and have **no MSB presence at
all**. Their `treasure_name` (`common90005300`) is the EMEVD **award site**, which I read as an MSB
asset marker. There is nothing in any MSB to extract a position from.

So the honest bottom line: **there is no large MSB win available.** Only **9** checks have an MSB
`treasure` record and no coordinate — the coords datamine is essentially complete for things the
MSBs actually place. The unplaced population is unplaced because it is awarded by script, sold by a
merchant, or dropped by an enemy.

That leaves exactly one route: a **NON-spatial** descriptor — who drops it, which quest, which
merchant. `TalkMsg` and the 365-file talk ESD are both bundled now, which makes that newly viable.

⚠️ For anyone reaching for the MSBs anyway, the layout is
`elden_ring_artifacts/{mapstudio,map}/<map_id>-msb-dcx/` with witchy's per-record XML underneath
(`Event/Treasure/*.xml`, `Part/Enemy/*.xml`, `Region/Other/*.xml`). Tools search both roots.

✅ FIXED 2026-08-04 (issue #338). `tools/build_nearest_grace.py` no longer has its own fold: the
one in `tools/overworld_fold.py` is now shared by the nearest-grace builder, the check browser and
the desc-triage page, and `test_gf_nearest_grace.py::test_there_is_exactly_one_overworld_fold`
asserts they are the SAME OBJECT rather than merely agreeing. The old copy folded at *256 regardless
of LOD and its regex required a trailing `_`, so all 725 three-field overworld item rows failed to
normalise while all 225 grace rows did -- the two sides of the join could never share a key.
Recovered 421 checks; 17 of them reach the player as a descriptor (the rest already had a better
layer). It also retired the 18 matches the 2000 m cap was catching at 8.7-10.4 km, which were the
"Altar South spans four regions" straddle phantom -- those now land 30-356 m from a sensible grace.
🛑 Still true and NOT fixed: the 134 checks that render a bare map id are starved of COORDINATES,
not of a join -- zero of them have a `nearest_grace` row even now. That half of #338 stands.

### MATT ORACLE — a read-only second opinion on the generated tables

`tools/matt_oracle.py` cross-checks `greenfield/eldenring/tables/` against
**thefifthmatt/SoulsRandomizers**, whose Elden Ring item-slot table (`diste/Base/itemslots.txt`) is
hand-curated over the same event-flag number space as our `[fFLAG]`. Two independent tables of the
same game: a disagreement is evidence, and it is the only second opinion our generated data has.
It gates two classes and reports the rest:

- **A. ITEM IDENTITY** — `item_ids.LOCATION_ITEM` vs the vanilla item his DebugText records for the
  same flag. 4076/4084 agree; the 8 disagreements are allowlisted by cause in the tool. (It was
  3977/4084 when the gate landed: 99 of the 107 were `region_map.csv`'s stale `item_name` capture
  naming the wrong DLC upgrade-material tier, closed by gen_data's lot-reconcile pass.)
- **B. MISSING SLOTS** — his Event-scope flags `data.LOCATIONS` has no row for, after excluding his
  `norandom` / `ignore` / `tarnished` / `enemy*` vocabulary. 80 remain, allowlisted by cause --
  and since the roadmap-item-3 triage every one of the 80 carries a CLASSIFIED reason (KEYING or
  SCOPE, each naming the gen_data exclusion or the derivation refusal that explains it). There is
  no OPEN bin in class B any more: a new missing slot fails the gate rather than joining a list.
- **C. ENEMY DROPS** -- **report-only, never a gate.** Our ONE-TIME (flagged) enemy-drop flags from
  `greenfield/enemy_drops.tsv` (`tools/datamine_enemy_drops.py`, derived from NpcParam /
  ItemLotParam_enemy) counted against his `enemy*`-tagged slots, with the flag-join overlap. His
  slot is a randomiser placement and ours is a param row: neither is a subset of the other, so
  equality would be noise and only the magnitudes are signal. Prints counts from his side and OUR
  flag ids from ours.

Region assignment, missable tagging, shop granularity and DLC membership are **report-only**
(`--report`): the two models differ structurally there, so equality would be noise, not signal.

- **I. UNCOVERED ROWS** — report-only, and the honest denominator for everything above. Every
  other class starts from HIS slots; this one starts from OURS and counts the rows with no
  Event-scope counterpart in his table at all (640 of 4,932, 13%, on 2026-09-22), classified
  from OUR names and flag bands: shop rows whose flag a shop DebugText line of his names
  (a counterpart keyed differently), sweep-granted rows, gestures, common-event 400k, other.
  Section A's agreement figure is over the joinable rows only; this section says how many the
  oracle cannot speak about.

- **G. REGION** — report-only, and the input to a **human review queue**. His areas are treated as
  an unlabelled clustering: each cluster maps to the one of OUR regions its rows mostly sit in
  (strict plurality; an evenly split cluster maps to nothing), and a row outside its own cluster is
  queued. 218 of 4291 joinable rows, plus the two DLC-membership flags 520800/530950 which are
  queued unconditionally. `--region-queue` refreshes
  `greenfield/evidence/oracle-region-queue.tsv`, carrying `status`/`reviewer`/`note` across by
  `(flag, ap_id)`. 🛑 That file contains **our** flag, ap_id and region and a reviewer's own words,
  and records only **that** a second source disagrees — never his area, Text or tags. His area
  label is an equivalence key inside the process and is discarded before anything is written.
  Reviewers rule from OUR evidence in the check browser's "Oracle region review" facet and the
  review notebook's queue view (map tile, nearest grace and the region that grace maps to,
  `check_region_second_opinion.tsv`), then `tools/apply_oracle_verdicts.py <notebook.json>`
  writes the verdicts back. Both browsers read only the committed tsv, so **CI never needs the
  checkout**. Ruled rows are fixed through the normal derivation ladder (`M61_TILE_CURATED`,
  `DUNGEON_REGION_CURATED`, `region_overrides.tsv` last) in a separate change — never from the
  queue, which is a review record and not a second region source.
- **D. MISSABLE** — report-only, and the input to the **second human review queue**, built on the
  same mechanism (same writer, same `(flag, ap_id)` key, same carry-over, same round trip). His
  `missable` tag is FILTER VOCABULARY: it selects which of OUR flags to look at. A flag is queued
  only where all three hold — he tags it missable, OUR `MISSABLE_LOCATIONS` does not, and OUR OWN
  `greenfield/questline_conditions.tsv` shows a `DIALOGUE_STEP` / `NPC_STATE` / `ITEM_POSSESSION`
  root on the award site (the three classes describing a gate a player can lose for good). The bare
  tag disagreement is ~68 joinable flags. The three-way intersection is 30 rows, basis
  `second-source-missable-disagrees`. Since 2026-09-22 the bare disagreements are queued TOO, under
  a second basis `second-source-missable-disagrees-no-local-gate` with an empty `our_conditions`
  (70 rows): they are the case where, if he is right, our extractor MISSED the gate, which is the
  one that strands a seed. The two bases are never merged; `MISSABLE_BASES` names both.
  `--missable-queue` refreshes `greenfield/evidence/oracle-missable-queue.tsv`. 🛑 Every column is
  ours (flag, ap_id, location name, condition classes) plus a reviewer's words; `basis` records
  only **that** a second source disagrees. Reviewers rule from the check browser's "Oracle missable
  review" facet and the notebook's missable queue view (our current missable status, the
  questline_conditions rows and what each waits on, the quest features mentioning the flag), then
  `tools/apply_oracle_verdicts.py --queue missable <notebook.json>` writes the verdicts back.
  Verdicts are `confirmed-not-missable` / `missable`, and a `missable` one must also name the
  mechanism (`limited-consumable` / `killable-npc` / `questline-progress`) because gen_data's
  missable classes are a closed vocabulary. Ruled rows are applied through the normal missable
  derivation in `greenfield/gen_data.py` in a separate change — never from the queue, and never by
  editing `tables/missable_locations.py`.

```bash
python tools/matt_oracle.py --souls-rando-dir <checkout>   # exit 1 on a NEW disagreement
SOULS_RANDO_DIR=<checkout> python tools/matt_oracle.py --report --json oracle.json
SOULS_RANDO_DIR=<checkout> python tools/matt_oracle.py --region-queue   # refresh the queue tsv
python tools/matt_oracle.py                                # no checkout -> "SKIP: ...", exit 0
```

🛑 **LICENCE BOUNDARY — nothing of his is ever committed here.** SoulsRandomizers is *"mostly all
rights reserved"*; its licence permits viewing/reproducing the sources and private non-conveyed use
of what they produce, and forbids CONVEYING the software, its parts or its derived output. So:
**no** slot rows, **no** location `Text` (his prose, copyrighted in that file's own header), **no**
area names, **no** tag strings as expectation data, **no** file copies. The allowlists are **bare
integer event flags with comments we wrote** — a flag id is a fact about the game, not an excerpt of
his table. Diagnostics print OUR name/ap_id/flag plus HIS flag id and the tag names used as filter
vocabulary, never his descriptions. The **shipped apworld never imports the tool or his data**.

`.github/workflows/matt-oracle.yaml` runs it weekly and on demand, cloning his repo at a **pinned
sha** into `$RUNNER_TEMP` (outside the workspace) and uploading only our own JSON verdict. It is
deliberately **not on `pull_request`**: a gate whose dependency is a third party's repository is a
gate nobody can fix, and one nobody can fix is one everybody merges past.

`test_gf_matt_oracle.py` gates the tool's logic against a **synthetic** itemslots fixture written
for the test, so it needs no checkout of his. 🛑 Do not "improve" that fixture with real rows.

## 6. The truncation gate (why edits are safe)

The sandbox mount can silently truncate/NUL-pad large writes. Tools guard against it:
- `tools/check_integrity.py` — flags zero-byte / NUL / truncated-syntax / EOF-imbalance
  (`--staged`, `--tracked`, or explicit files). Runs as the `core.hooksPath tools/hooks`
  pre-commit hook (`git commit --no-verify` to bypass).
- `tools/safe_publish.sh SRC DST` — atomic same-FS rename publish with byte+sha verify.
- Run `check_integrity` against **git blobs / the real clone**, not sandbox *mount* paths
  (the mount can serve a truncated view and false-alarm). 🛑 That false alarm is a **Windows**-mount
  property (Alaric, 2026-08-16) — a macOS mount does not truncate. Run against blobs regardless, so
  the habit does not depend on which machine is hosting.

## 7. Commit + push checklist

- **CLAIM THE ISSUE BEFORE YOU BUILD.** Self-assign it on GitHub *before* the branch exists, and
  check first that it has no assignee and no open PR referencing it. You are usually not the only
  one working this tracker: on 2026-08-16 issue #749 was taken twice inside fourteen minutes — an
  outside contributor's #750 and a second fix in #752 — and the contributor was then reviewed and
  told to build what #752 had already built. Every one of the 202 open issues had zero assignees, so
  there was nothing to check even for someone who thought to look. Full rule in CONTRIBUTING,
  *"Claim the issue before you build"*.
  🛑 The claim goes on the ISSUE. An unpushed branch is invisible and a pushed branch with no PR is
  nearly so; the issue is where everyone already looks. If you stop, unassign — a stale claim blocks
  someone else.
- Edit in the authorized checkout described in section 1; regen if you touched a generator; run the tests.
- Stage explicitly — **never `git add -A`** (the repo is public and game-data-purged; don't
  leak the artifacts symlink). `git diff --cached --stat` before committing.
- The pre-commit hook runs `check_integrity --staged` automatically.
- **CROSS-REPO CHANGE? The ORDER is fixed, and the gitlink bump is part of the change, not a follow-up.**
  Anything that moves `contract_gen.rs` or `region_locks.rs` (a new slot_data key, a new option subkey, a
  version bump, a region-spine edit) has a client half and a world half:
  1. Land the **client** PR first, so the generated file exists on client `main`.
  2. In the **world** PR, bump the gitlink **in the same commit as the generated-output change**:
     `git update-index --cacheinfo 160000,<client-sha>,from-software-archipelago-clients`, then confirm with
     `git ls-tree HEAD | grep 160000`.
  CI's `generators` job regenerates INTO a checkout of the pinned commit and fails on a non-empty diff, so a
  bump left for a separate follow-up commit leaves a window where main is red and a tag cut from it ships an
  apworld against a DLL that disagrees with it. (Before 2026-08-02 that job read client `main` instead and
  the window was invisible: world main `0ff714c` pinned `c2fc8ed`, which announced
  `APWORLD_VERSION_EXPECTED = "0.3.0"` while the world was already 0.3.1, and every gate was green.)
  The `client-main-drift` job — push-to-main and nightly, never on a PR — watches the other direction.
- Player-visible change? The `release/CHANGELOG.md` line goes in **this** commit and the
  version's `BLURB-v<version>.md` grows with it -- `python tools/check_release_notes.py`
  (CONTRIBUTING rule 14). Do not leave it for tag time; that is how the blurb series died.
- **Opening a release window? Run `python3 tools/open_window.py --to X.Y.Z`, do not do it by hand.**
  It is SEVEN files across TWO repos, and the last three windows each found one of them by going
  red in CI rather than by looking: v0.4.4, v0.4.5 and v0.4.6 all shipped "no client half was
  needed" (`contract_gen.rs` embeds the version string, so a version-only bump makes the pinned
  client stale), and v0.4.6 also shipped a stale wizard blob. The tool drives every site off
  `check_version_sites.SITES` — it has no list of its own — regenerates what is derived instead of
  patching it, and refuses to finish unless all seven agree. It writes no prose: the notes are
  skeletons with `TODO(open)` markers, and `--check-notes` fails while any survive.
  ⚠️ It commits the client half on a branch and stops. Landing that PR and bumping the gitlink in
  the same commit is still yours, per the ordering above.
- `git fetch` + rebase onto **the branch you verified in §2** before pushing (Alaric pushes
  concurrently, often mid-session — re-fetch late, not once at the start); resolve/regen if the rebase
  touched generated files, then `git push origin HEAD:<that branch>`.
  ⚠️ Do not copy a branch name out of this file into a `push` command. This bullet has named the wrong
  target twice (`feat/matt-free-backbone-mvp`, then a flat `main` while world work was on
  `feat/natural-progression-mode`, now merged). Client fixes go to client `main`; world work goes wherever
  §2's verify command says it is. (Corrected 2026-07-14, re-corrected 2026-07-24 and 2026-07-25.)
- Relay commit SHAs to Alaric explicitly. Two things NOT to recite as boilerplate:
  - **"needs a submodule bump"** — VERIFY before saying it. `git ls-tree origin/main from-software-archipelago-clients`
    (the pinned gitlink) vs `git ls-remote https://github.com/4laric/from-software-archipelago-clients.git refs/heads/main`
    (client HEAD). Equal ⇒ already current, say nothing. `build.ps1 -Rust`/`-All` AUTO-bumps the gitlink
    (guarded; see §4), so a pin that is merely BEHIND on client-only work gets fixed by Alaric's next build
    — mention that case only if he has not re-run the build.
    ⚠️ **Re-corrected 2026-08-02: this bullet used to end "the world CI tests against client main regardless,
    so a bump is never required for green CI." That is no longer true, and the sentence it replaced was the
    reason the pin could rot.** The `generators` job now checks the client out AT THE GITLINK, so a bump IS
    required for green CI whenever the change moves a cross-repo generated artifact — see the next bullet.
  - **"needs a Windows cargo build"** — only when you actually pushed a client `.rs` change (the push-to-`main`
    CI does that build; hand over the Actions link, don't claim you read the run).
