## Non-negotiables

### Tests are part of every task
- Every bug fix must include a regression test that would have caught the bug.
- Every new feature must include tests covering its logic in full.
- Run `flutter test` before every commit — only commit if all tests pass.
- If logic is too deep in the widget tree to unit test, write the closest possible test (model/service/repository level) and note explicitly what cannot be automated.

### Always use AppLocalizations for UI strings
- Never hardcode user-visible text in widget trees.
- Any label, tooltip, snackbar message, dialog text, or button label must have a key in `lib/l10n/app_en.arb` and be referenced via `AppLocalizations.of(context)!.someKey`.
- Add the key to all locale ARB files, then run `flutter gen-l10n`.
- The app ships in 9 languages — hardcoded strings silently break all non-English users.
- `app_pt.arb` is Brazilian Portuguese only — there is a single Portuguese locale for this app, and it targets Brazil. Never introduce European Portuguese spelling or vocabulary (e.g. "ficheiro", "deteção"/"detetar", "descarregar", "ecrã", "utilizador", "está a fazer"-style progressive) — use the Brazilian equivalent instead (e.g. "arquivo", "detecção"/"detectar", "baixar", "tela", "usuário", "está fazendo"). When adding or editing a `pt` string, match the vocabulary already established in the rest of `app_pt.arb`.

### New model fields must be evaluated for Drive sync AND local backup
- When adding a field to `MusicProject` (or any synced model), decide: is this user-generated data or a device-local preference?
- **User data** (metadata, timers, todos, paths) → add to `_serializeProject` AND `_deserializeProject` in `lib/services/google_drive_sync_service.dart`. If skipped, the field is silently lost on every Drive restore.
- **Device-local settings** (which theme is selected, layout, update checks) → do NOT sync. `AppSettings` fields are generally device-local.
- The split can run through one feature: a **custom theme's definition** is user data (synced and backed up), while **which theme is selected** is a device-local preference (neither). Ask the question per field, not per feature.
- Also check `lib/services/backup_service.dart` (local file export/import) for the same question, for any *global* (non-per-profile) data — `TodoTemplate`, `ProjectTemplate`, `TemplateRoot`, custom mixdown folder names, custom themes, phase settings. This is Flatpak's only backup path (see below), so a field skipped here is a field Flatpak users can never back up at all, not just "won't survive a Drive restore."
- Merging is **union, never deletion**: something present locally but absent in the incoming data is something made since, not something removed. On a same-id collision the newer `updatedAt` wins. `mergeCustomThemes` is the reference implementation.

### Google Drive sync is not offered inside Flatpak
- `GoogleDriveSyncService.isSupported` is `false` only when actually running inside a Flatpak sandbox (detected via the `/.flatpak-info` marker file every Flatpak app has at runtime), `true` everywhere else — including the plain Linux tarball and the AppImage. Every UI entry point to `GoogleDriveSyncPage` (dashboard, profile page, startup dialog, tray menu) is gated on it — don't add a new one without the same gate.
- Why: the desktop OAuth flow requires a client secret (confirmed against a live Google sign-in attempt — PKCE alone isn't accepted for this app's "Desktop app" OAuth client type; see the long comment on `_desktopClientSecret` in `google_drive_sync_service.dart`). Flathub's build sandbox has no secret-injection mechanism, so shipping the secret there would mean committing it in the open in the public Flathub submission repo. Not offering the feature was chosen over that for Flatpak specifically — the tarball/AppImage are built by this repo's own CI (`build_linux` in `release.yml`), same trust boundary as Windows/macOS, so they get the real secret too.
- The Flatpak build compiles `lib/config/oauth_config.dart` from the committed template's placeholder text directly (no real values, no GitHub secrets involved) — see `flatpak/README.md`. The Linux tarball/AppImage build (`build_linux`) injects real values from GitHub secrets like every other desktop platform.

## Architecture

### State management — Riverpod
- All providers live in `lib/providers/providers.dart`.
- Main data flow: `repositoryProvider` → `allProjectsStreamProvider` → `projectsProvider` (filtered/sorted) → UI.
- Search state is per-tab: `projectsSearchProvider`, `releasesSearchProvider`, `queueSearchProvider`, etc.

### Local persistence — Hive CE
- Models with `@HiveType` / `@HiveField` and a `part` directive (e.g. `Release`, `TodoTemplate`) use code-generated adapters — run `dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs` after changing them.
- `MusicProject` and other models have manually written `TypeAdapter`s inline in their model file — `build_runner` skips these intentionally.
- Adapters are registered in `ProjectRepository` with `isAdapterRegistered` guards to prevent double-registration.

### Platform detection
- Use `MobileUtils.isMobile()` (from `lib/utils/mobile_utils.dart`) for mobile vs desktop checks — not `Platform.isAndroid` or `Platform.isIOS` directly.
- Desktop = macOS + Windows + Linux. Mobile = Android + iOS.
- Primary development and test target is **macOS**.
- Linux is otherwise a full desktop target. The only feature gap is Google Drive sync specifically inside the Flatpak build (see `GoogleDriveSyncService.isSupported` above) — the tarball/AppImage have it.

### Themes — every theme is a `CustomTheme` spec fed through one builder
- There is exactly **one** `ThemeData` builder: `AppThemes.buildFrom(CustomTheme)` in `lib/providers/theme_provider.dart`. The three built-ins are `CustomTheme` constants (`neonDarkSpec`, `classicDarkSpec`, `studioLightSpec`) run through it, and user themes go through the same call. Never hand-write a second `ThemeData` — a component styled in only one builder is a component user themes fall back to raw Material defaults for.
- `test/providers/built_in_theme_regression_test.dart` keeps a verbatim copy of the pre-refactor themes and asserts `buildFrom` still reproduces them. If you change `buildFrom`, that test tells you which built-in you moved. Its one accepted deviation (`studioLight`'s `bodySmall` tone) is documented in the file.
- Two active themes: `AppThemeType.neonDark` and `AppThemeType.classicDark`. `AppThemeType.studioLight` exists in the enum but is hidden from the UI until it is ready — `AppThemes.visibleBuiltIns` is the list every menu, switcher and picker must use; `allBuiltIns` is only for resolving a stored id.
- The active theme is identified by a **string id**, not an enum: `selectedThemeIdProvider` holds either an `AppThemeType.name` or a user theme's uuid, and `activeThemeProvider` resolves it to a spec (falling back to Classic Dark for anything unknown). Watch `themeDataProvider` for colors and `activeThemeProvider` when you need the spec.
- **Never branch on theme identity.** `themeType == AppThemeType.neonDark` used to pick grid row colors in four places, which silently lumped every user theme in with Classic Dark. Derive from the spec instead — `hasVividAccent`, `gridRowSelectColor`, `gridRowOddColor`, `gridRowEvenColor`, `gridBorderColor` in `lib/utils/theme_derivations.dart`.
- A widget that caches colors (any `TrinaGrid`) must key on `spec.identityKey`, not `spec.id` — editing a user theme keeps its id, and the id alone would leave the old palette on screen.
- User themes are **dark-only in v1**: the editor pins `brightness` to `Brightness.dark` because large parts of the UI still carry hardcoded `Colors.white70`-style literals that vanish on a light background. Unlocking the toggle is the same work as finishing `studioLight`.
- Theme *definitions* are user data: they sync to Drive and go into local backup (see `mergeCustomThemes` in `lib/services/custom_theme_merge.dart`, shared by both so a restore and a sync can't disagree). The *selected* theme is a device-local preference and is deliberately in neither.

## UI conventions

### A version stack is a *virtual* project — never assume a row has a file
- Version stacking (#94) makes a stack a real row in the projects box with `isVirtual: true`, whose `filePath` is the **folder** its versions live in, not a file. Anything that treats a non-resolving path as "the file was deleted" must gate on `MusicProject.isMissingFileCandidate` — `missingProjectIds` and the grid's `cloud_off` indicator already do. Getting this wrong offers to delete the one row holding a song's shared notes, todos, deadline and work time.
- A stack owns the shared metadata; its members keep their own fields **untouched but dormant**, which is what makes `unstack` lossless. Stacking promotes exactly one member's metadata (`stackProjects(metadataSourceId:)`) — nothing is ever merged, so two versions' details cannot be mangled together. The dashboard asks which member to promote only when two or more of them satisfy `MusicProject.hasUserMetadata`.
- Work time and sessions on a stack are **derived on read** (`stackTotalWorkSeconds` / `stackSessions`), never stored on the stack row. Don't add a rolled-up copy — it would need invalidating on every timer tick, member deletion and Drive restore.
- `projectsProvider` filters out stack members (`isStackMember`), so the list shows the stack instead of its versions. Anything totalling that list counts a stacked song once.
- `ScanMode.versionStack` is the third scan mode: it auto-stacks by immediate parent folder via `ProjectRepository.autoStackFolders()`, which runs after every scan. It only ever *adds* — it never unstacks, re-parents or dissolves anything, so hand-made stacks survive a rescan. Manual stacking works in **all three** modes; the mode only controls the automatic pass.

### Launching a project in its DAW always goes through `launchProjectInDaw`
- Use `launchProjectInDaw(context, ref, project)` from `lib/ui/session_actions.dart` for every "open/launch in DAW" button — never call `FileLauncher.launchProject`/`launchWithBinary` directly from UI code.
- Why: this is the one place that knows about the DAW executable-override system (`ProjectRepository.getDawLaunchCommandPaths`, Settings > DAW Locations — every desktop platform), its missing-path remediation, and the configure prompt (`showDawLaunchCommandDialog`). A DAW type maps to a *list* of override paths: one resolves → run it, several resolve → `showDawLaunchPickerDialog` asks which. The configure prompt fires up front on Linux (no dependable OS file association) and only after a failed standard launch on Windows/macOS. A direct `FileLauncher` call bypasses all of that. The decision lives in the pure `resolveDawLaunchAction` / `shouldPromptDawLocationAfterFailedLaunch` helpers.

### Destructive confirm-dialog buttons need an explicit `foregroundColor`
- Any `ElevatedButton`/`FilledButton` styled with a hardcoded red `backgroundColor` (delete/remove/reset confirmations) must also set `foregroundColor` — Flutter does not derive readable text contrast from an arbitrary `backgroundColor` on its own, and the default has been wrong before.
- Pairing used throughout the app: `Colors.red` / `Colors.red.shade700` → `foregroundColor: Colors.white`; `Colors.red.shade300` (lighter, used for less-destructive actions like "Hide" or "Remove") → `foregroundColor: Colors.black`.

### A `Row` pairing a text field with a button needs `CrossAxisAlignment.center`
- `Row(children: [Expanded(child: TextField(...)), button])` defaults to `CrossAxisAlignment.start`, which top-aligns the button against the field's full decorated height (label + border) instead of visually centering it — looks broken, especially once the field grows (e.g. an `errorText`).
- Always set `crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.center` on this shape of `Row`. This has been the same one-line bug fixed independently in multiple dialogs — grep for `CrossAxisAlignment.start` near a `TextField` before assuming a new field+button row is fine as-is.

### A DAW logo shown as a field's `prefixIcon` needs explicit sizing
- `Image.asset(getDawLogoPath(dawType), ...)` renders at the source PNG's native size if unconstrained — oversized and breaking the field's layout when used as an `InputDecoration.prefixIcon`.
- Always pass `width: 16, height: 16, fit: BoxFit.contain`, with an `errorBuilder` falling back to `Icon(Icons.piano, color: color)` for DAWs with no logo asset. See `_buildDawPrefixIcon` in `lib/ui/project_detail_page.dart` for the canonical implementation to mirror.

### A grid row's "open full detail page" action uses `Icons.assignment` + `tooltipViewDetails`
- Every `TrinaGrid` actions column that navigates to a dedicated detail page (not an inline edit dialog) uses `Icon(Icons.assignment)` with `tooltip: l10n.tooltipViewDetails`, matching `dashboard_page.dart`'s project rows. Keep new detail-page entry points (grid action icon, row double-tap) consistent with this rather than inventing a new icon/label per page.

## Common tasks

### Adding a new DAW
1. Add the file extension (with comment) to `ScannerService.supportedExtensions` in `lib/services/scanner_service.dart`.
2. Map the extension to a display name in `MetadataExtractor` (`lib/services/metadata_extractor.dart`).
3. Optionally add a logo asset and register it in the logo map in `dashboard_page.dart`.
4. Update the supported DAWs table in `README.md`.

### Adding a new UI string
1. Add the key + English value to `lib/l10n/app_en.arb`.
2. Add the same key to every other `app_<locale>.arb` file (use the English value as a placeholder if translation is pending).
3. Run `flutter gen-l10n` — generated code lands in `lib/generated/l10n/`.
4. Reference via `AppLocalizations.of(context)!.yourKey` — never import the generated file directly; it is re-exported from the package.

### Adding a new MusicProject field
1. Add a `@HiveField(N)` with the next available index.
2. Add a default value in the `MusicProjectAdapter.read()` for backwards compatibility with existing boxes.
3. Add the field to `copyWith()`.
4. Decide sync scope (see Non-negotiables above) and update `_serializeProject` / `_deserializeProject` if needed.
5. Update `TestFactories.makeProject()` in `test/helpers/test_factories.dart` to expose the field for tests.
