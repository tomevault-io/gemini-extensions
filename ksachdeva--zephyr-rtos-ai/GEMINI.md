## Project Overview

The primary objective of this repository is to create reusable AI agents, skills, tools etc for Zephyr RTOS based firmware development.

You have access to a meta skill called `zephyr-skill-creator` that acts as the guide on how to create
various other skills.

## Development Setup

This is a `uv` project which means that you MUST run any `python` script/app using `uv run` so that
the proper `virtualenv` is used.

`poe.toml` file contains reusable tasks that generally wrap other tools.

## Prohibited

You are *NOT* allowed to make changes to following development setup files:

- poe.toml
- pyproject.toml
- uv.lock

You are *NOT* allowed to run following commands:

- `uv run poe west-setup`
