# Claude.md - Project Documentation for AI Assistance

This document provides context about the homebridge-mitsubishi-comfort plugin architecture, implementation details, and recent changes to help Claude (or other AI assistants) understand the codebase.

## Project Overview

This is a Homebridge plugin for Mitsubishi heat pumps using the Kumo Cloud v3 API. It provides HomeKit integration for controlling Mitsubishi mini-split systems.

**Current Version:** 1.7.0

## Architecture Overview

### Core Components

1. **platform.ts** - Main platform plugin
   - Handles device discovery and registration
   - Manages centralized site-level polling
   - Initializes streaming connection
   - Coordinates between accessories and API

2. **accessory.ts** - Individual thermostat accessory
   - Implements HomeKit thermostat service
   - Handles characteristic get/set operations
   - Receives updates from both streaming and polling
   - Manages device-specific state

3. **kumo-api.ts** - API client
   - Authentication with JWT tokens (auto-refresh every 15 minutes)
   - REST API endpoints for commands and device status
   - Socket.IO streaming for real-time updates
   - Connection management and error handling

4. **settings.ts** - Configuration and types
   - API endpoints and constants
   - TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
   - Configuration schema definitions

## Recent Major Changes

### v1.3.0 - Intelligent Streaming Health Monitoring and Adaptive Polling

**🎯 Goal:** Reduce API calls by 95% while maintaining reliability through smart fallback.

#### Key Achievement
- **Before:** ~257 API calls/hour (polling every 30s + streaming)
- **After:** ~12 API calls/hour (token refresh only when streaming healthy)
- **Reduction:** 95% fewer API calls and DNS queries

#### What Changed

**1. Streaming Health Monitoring (`kumo-api.ts`)**
- Added health tracking system that monitors Socket.IO connection status
- Health check every 30s (configurable)
- Callback system notifies platform of health changes
- Relies on Socket.IO's built-in heartbeat mechanism
- Code: `kumo-api.ts:36-42, 566-647`

**2. Adaptive Polling (`platform.ts`)**
- **Normal Mode:** Streaming healthy → polling disabled (if `disablePolling: true`)
- **Degraded Mode:** Streaming fails → fast polling activates (10s intervals)
- Automatic mode switching based on streaming health
- Comprehensive logging for all state transitions
- Code: `platform.ts:25-27, 343-458`

**3. Race Condition Prevention (`accessory.ts`)**
- Timestamp-based update filtering
- Prevents old polling data from overwriting newer streaming data
- Tracks update source (streaming vs polling)
- Code: `accessory.ts:15-16, 122-145`

**4. New Configuration Options**
- `disablePolling` - Now recommended! Enables optimal streaming-only mode
- `degradedPollInterval` - Fast polling when streaming unhealthy (default: 10s)
- `streamingHealthCheckInterval` - Health check frequency (default: 30s)
- `streamingStaleThreshold` - No longer used (deprecated, kept for compatibility)

#### How It Works

**Startup:**
```
1. Streaming connects → marked healthy
2. If disablePolling=true → no polling starts
3. Only token refresh queries (every 15 min)
```

**When Streaming Disconnects:**
```
1. Health check detects disconnect
2. Platform switches to DEGRADED MODE
3. Fast polling activates (10s intervals)
4. Devices remain responsive via polling
```

**When Streaming Reconnects:**
```
1. Socket reconnects → marked healthy
2. Platform switches to NORMAL MODE
3. Polling halts (if disablePolling=true)
4. Back to streaming-only updates
```

**Logging Examples:**
```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Mitsubishi Comfort Plugin Configuration
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Streaming: ENABLED
Polling mode: On-demand only
Strategy: Streaming primary, polling fallback only
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✓ Streaming connection established
Monitoring 3 device(s) for real-time updates

[When streaming fails]
✗ Streaming disconnected: transport close
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
⚠ STREAMING INTERRUPTED
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
→ Switching to DEGRADED MODE
→ Polling activated: 10s intervals
```

### v1.2.0 - Real-time Streaming Support

We added Socket.IO streaming to receive real-time device updates instead of relying solely on polling.

#### Implementation Details

**Streaming Connection:**
- Server: `socket-prod.kumocloud.com`
- Protocol: Socket.IO v4
- Transport: Polling initially, upgrades to WebSocket
- Authentication: Bearer token in extraHeaders

**Flow:**
1. Platform starts streaming after device discovery
2. Socket connects and emits 'subscribe' event for each device serial
3. Server sends 'device_update' events with full device state
4. Callbacks in accessory.ts process updates immediately
5. HomeKit characteristics update in real-time

**Key Code Locations:**
- Streaming initialization: `platform.ts:219-227`
- Socket.IO setup: `kumo-api.ts:418-497`
- Device subscription: `kumo-api.ts:499-507`
- Update handling: `accessory.ts:67-103`

#### Polling Strategy (Updated in v1.3.0)

**Current behavior:** Intelligent adaptive polling
- **With `disablePolling: true` (recommended):** Polling only activates when streaming fails
- **With `disablePolling: false` (default):** Polling runs continuously alongside streaming
- Interval: 30 seconds in normal mode (configurable via `pollInterval`)
- Degraded: 10 seconds when streaming fails (configurable via `degradedPollInterval`)
- Scope: Site-level (one API call per site fetches all zones)

**Why this approach:**
- Streaming is the primary update mechanism (instant, no API calls)
- Polling provides automatic fallback if streaming fails
- Health monitoring ensures seamless transitions
- 95% reduction in API calls when streaming is healthy

### Centralized Site Polling

Previously each accessory polled individually. Now polling happens at the platform level:
- One API call per site fetches all zones
- Platform distributes zone data to relevant accessories
- Significantly reduces API calls (5 devices → 1 API call per poll cycle)

**Code:** `platform.ts:242-288`

### Token Management

JWT tokens expire every 20 minutes. We handle this with:
- Auto-refresh at 15-minute mark (5 min before expiry)
- Concurrent request protection (multiple requests wait for single refresh)
- Automatic re-login if refresh fails
- Token included in both REST and Socket.IO auth

**Code:** `kumo-api.ts:119-209`

## API Details

### Kumo Cloud v3 API Endpoints

**Base URL:** `https://app-prod.kumocloud.com/v3`

**Required Headers:**
- `Authorization: Bearer <access-token>` (all authenticated requests)
- `X-App-Version: 3.2.4` (all requests; constant in `settings.ts`)

**Authentication:**
- `POST /login` - Returns access and refresh tokens (plus user profile: id, email, etc.)
- `POST /refresh` - Refreshes access token

**Data Retrieval:**
- `GET /accounts/me` - Account info (similar to login response)
- `GET /sites` - List all sites (homes)
- `GET /sites/{siteId}/zones` - Get all zones for a site (includes nested `group` and `adapter` objects)
  - Returns full device status for each zone
  - This is the primary polling endpoint
- `GET /sites/{siteId}/groups` - System changeover groups (minRuntime, maxStandby)
- `GET /devices/{serial}` - Full device info (includes `model` object with brand, gallery image)
- `GET /devices/{serial}/profile` - Device capabilities (modes, fan speeds, setpoint limits)
- `GET /devices/{serial}/status` - Connection status, `cryptoSerial`, `firmwareVersion`, `autoModeDisable`
- `GET /devices/{serial}/kumo-properties` - Reporting, `outdoorAirTemperature`, `heatModeDisable`

**Commands:**
- `POST /devices/send-command` - Send command to device
  - Body: `{ deviceSerial: string, commands: Commands }`
  - Commands include: power, operationMode, spHeat, spCool, fanSpeed, etc.

### Socket.IO Streaming

**URL:** `wss://socket-prod.kumocloud.com`

**Client → Server Emits:**
| Emit | Arguments | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| `subscribe` | `(deviceSerial)` | Subscribe to device updates |
| `subscribe` | `('', userId)` | Account-level subscribe (needed for `adapter_update`) |
| `force_adapter_request` | `(deviceSerial, 'iuStatus')` | Request indoor unit status |
| `force_adapter_request` | `(deviceSerial, 'profile')` | Request device profile → triggers `profile_update` |
| `force_adapter_request` | `(deviceSerial, 'adapterStatus')` | Request adapter info → triggers `adapter_update` |
| `device_status_v2` | `(deviceSerial)` or `('')` | Request connection status |

**Server → Client Events:**
| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `device_update` | Full device state (temperature, mode, setpoints, displayConfig) |
| `profile_update` | Device capabilities (modes, fan speeds, setpoint limits) |
| `device_status_v2` | Connection status (connected/disconnected) |
| `adapter_update` | Adapter hardware (firmware, WiFi RSSI — contains password, strip before logging) |
| `acoil_update` | A-coil/outdoor unit data (minimal: serial + date) |

**`device_update` Format:**
```typescript
{
  id: string
  deviceSerial: string
  roomTemp: number
  spHeat: number
  spCool: number
  spAuto: number | null
  power: 0 | 1
  operationMode: 'off' | 'heat' | 'cool' | 'auto' | 'autoHeat' | 'autoCool' | 'vent' | 'dry'
  fanSpeed: string
  airDirection: string
  humidity: number | null
  connected: boolean
  rssi: number
  modelNumber: string                  // e.g. "SVZ-KP30NA"
  previousOperationMode: string
  displayConfig: {
    filter: boolean                    // filter needs cleaning (= filterDirty in local API)
    defrost: boolean                   // defrost cycle active
    standby: boolean                   // compressor idle
    hotAdjust: boolean
  }
  // Also includes: isSimulator, ledDisabled, isHeadless, scheduleOwner,
  // scheduleHoldEndTime, activeThermistor, tempSource, twoFiguresCode,
  // unusualFigures, statusDisplay, runTest, lastStatusChangeAt, createdAt, updatedAt, timeZone
}
```

**Note on `operationMode`:** When *sending* commands, use `'auto'`. The API *returns* `'autoHeat'` or `'autoCool'` to indicate which sub-mode auto is currently in. The code handles this via `startsWith('auto')` in `accessory.ts`.

**Note on `autoModeDisable`:** The `/devices/{serial}/status` endpoint returns `autoModeDisable: true` for units that don't support auto mode at the hardware level. This explains why `spAuto` is null for some devices.

## Configuration

**Config Schema:** `config.schema.json`

**Required:**
- `username` - Kumo Cloud email (must include '@')
- `password` - Kumo Cloud password

**Optional:**
- `pollInterval` - Seconds between polls when streaming healthy (default: 30, min: 5)
- `disablePolling` - **Recommended!** Disable polling when streaming healthy (default: false)
- `degradedPollInterval` - Fast polling when streaming unhealthy (default: 10, min: 5, max: 60)
- `streamingHealthCheckInterval` - Health check frequency (default: 30, min: 10, max: 300)
- `streamingStaleThreshold` - Deprecated (no longer used, kept for compatibility)
- `excludeDevices` - Array of device serials to skip
- `debug` - Enable debug logging
- `localControl` - **Opt-in (default false).** Control units directly over the LAN; cloud stays for discovery/credentials and as a per-unit fallback. See "Local LAN Control". Requires a full homebridge restart to toggle (child bridge).
- `localPollInterval` - Seconds between local status polls when `localControl` is on (default: 15, min: 5, max: 120)
- `localControlIps` - Optional `{ "<deviceSerial>": "<ip>" }` map to skip LAN discovery for specific units

**Recommended Configuration (Optimal Efficiency):**
```json
{
  "platform": "KumoV3",
  "username": "user@example.com",
  "password": "password123",
  "disablePolling": true
}
```

**Advanced Configuration:**

  "disablePolling": true,
  "degradedPollInterval": 10,
  "streamingHealthCheckInterval": 30,
  "excludeDevices": ["SERIAL123"],
  "debug": false
}
```

## HomeKit Characteristics Mapping

| HomeKit Characteristic | Kumo API Field | Notes |
|----------------------|----------------|-------|
| CurrentTemperature | roomTemp | In Celsius |
| TargetTemperature | spHeat/spCool | Depends on mode. Dry → `spCool` (Kumo v3 keeps the dry setpoint there; no `spDry` field), gated on `usesSetPointInDryMode` |
| HeatingThresholdTemperature | spHeat | The low/heat edge of the AUTO band (since 1.6.0). Surfaced by the Home app only in AUTO |
| CoolingThresholdTemperature | spCool | The high/cool edge of the AUTO band (since 1.6.0). Surfaced by the Home app only in AUTO |
| CurrentHeatingCoolingState | power + operationMode | OFF/HEAT/COOL |
| TargetHeatingCoolingState | operationMode | OFF/HEAT/COOL/AUTO |
| CurrentRelativeHumidity | humidity | Optional sensor |
| FilterChangeIndication | displayConfig.filter | From streaming only |
| Model (AccessoryInformation) | modelNumber | Set once from streaming |
| Switch "Fan" (On) | operationMode === 'vent' && power === 1 | Separate `Switch` service; ON sends `vent`, OFF sends `off` (powers the unit down) |
| Switch "Dry" (On) | operationMode === 'dry' && power === 1 | Separate `Switch` service; ON sends `dry`, OFF sends `off`. Capability-gated on `hasModeDry`. Mutually exclusive with the Fan switch |

### AUTO dual setpoints

In AUTO, the Home app shows a temperature *range* (two handles) instead of a single setpoint, via the optional `HeatingThresholdTemperature` and `CoolingThresholdTemperature` characteristics on the Thermostat service.

- **Heating handle ↔ `spHeat`** (low/heat edge), **cooling handle ↔ `spCool`** (high/cool edge). These units report `spAuto: null` and `autoModeDisable: false`, so AUTO uses the `spHeat`/`spCool` band — live-verified (every poll showed `Auto: null` with independent setpoints).
- Both characteristics are added in the constructor (so they publish through the normal discovery path — no `publishStructureChange` needed) and their props are set to the device's supported range in `applyDeviceProfile`.
- **Writes are independent:** dragging the heating handle sends `{ spHeat }`, the cooling handle sends `{ spCool }` — neither clobbers the other edge. Both inherit the 1.5.2 powered-off guard (cache + echo, no `modeRequiredWhenDeviceOff` 400) and revert on failure.
- Zone/streaming updates sync both handles. The Home app only surfaces them in AUTO, so refreshing them in HEAT/COOL is harmless even when a unit's stale `spHeat`/`spCool` are inverted (each characteristic is independent within its own min/max props).
- `TargetTemperature` and the HEAT/COOL/DRY paths are untouched.
- Code: `accessory.ts:getHeatingThresholdTemperature / getCoolingThresholdTemperature / setThresholdTemperature`
- Live-verified end-to-end on real hardware (2026-06-14): both handles round-trip to `spHeat`/`spCool`, the cloud holds the band across a streaming reconcile.

### Fan-only switch

HomeKit's `Thermostat` service has no fan-only target state, so we expose a second `Switch` service per accessory (subtype `fan-only`).

- **Capability-gated:** the switch is only added once the device profile reports `hasModeVent === true`. If a cached accessory carries a switch but the profile reports no vent support, it's removed.
- **Switch ON** → `sendCommand({ operationMode: 'vent', power: 1 })`
- **Switch OFF** → `sendCommand({ operationMode: 'off', power: 0 })` — turns the unit off entirely
- The `power` field is sent explicitly on the fan path to match the verified v3 cloud reference ([EnumC/ha_kumo_ws](https://github.com/EnumC/ha_kumo_ws)); the existing HEAT/COOL/AUTO path still omits `power` since the API derives it from a non-off `operationMode`.
- The switch is kept in sync with streaming/polling updates: ON iff `power === 1 && operationMode === 'vent'`.
- Changing the thermostat to HEAT / COOL / AUTO / OFF optimistically flips the switch off; engaging the switch optimistically sets the thermostat to OFF (since HomeKit's thermostat service can't represent fan-only).
- Code: `accessory.ts:setupFanOnlySwitch / removeFanOnlySwitch / setFanOnlyOn / isFanOnlyActive`

### Dry switch

HomeKit's `Thermostat` service has no dehumidify target state either, so dry is surfaced the same way as fan-only: a separate `Switch` service per accessory (subtype `dry`).

- **Capability-gated:** added only once the device profile reports `hasModeDry === true` (a real top-level field in the v3 profile payload — see `API-EXPLORATION-FINDINGS.md`). A cached switch on a device that reports no dry support is removed.
- **Switch ON** → `sendCommand({ operationMode: 'dry', power: 1 })`
- **Switch OFF** → `sendCommand({ operationMode: 'off', power: 0 })` — turns the unit off entirely
- The switch is kept in sync with streaming/polling updates: ON iff `power === 1 && operationMode === 'dry'`.
- **Mutually exclusive with fan-only:** engaging dry optimistically flips the Fan switch off, and engaging fan-only flips the Dry switch off; changing the thermostat to HEAT / COOL / AUTO / OFF flips both off. Streaming/polling reconciles as the authoritative backstop. The optimistic cross-flip is unconditional because a successful command always leaves the unit in this switch's mode or `off` — never the sibling's mode.
- **Setpoint (since 1.5.3):** units that report `usesSetPointInDryMode === true` accept a target while dehumidifying, and the Kumo v3 cloud keeps that target in **`spCool`** (there is no `spDry` field). The on/off Dry *switch* can't express a temperature, but the **Thermostat's `TargetTemperature` characteristic** now reads/writes `spCool` while in dry (see `getTargetTempFromStatus` / `setTargetTemperature` / `dryUsesSetpoint`). The thermostat tile still shows OFF in dry (`TargetHeatingCoolingState === 0`), so the stock Home app surfaces no dry-setpoint UI — but raw-characteristic clients (e.g. the Portal dashboard) can now read and set it. On units that report `usesSetPointInDryMode === false`, dry stays setpoint-less (the write falls through to the heat branch and the read falls back as before).
- Code: `accessory.ts:setupDrySwitch / removeDrySwitch / setDryOn / isDryActive`

## Local LAN Control (since 1.7.0, opt-in)

Direct control of the indoor units over the LAN, modeled on Home Assistant's
official `mitsubishi_comfort` integration (`iot_class: local_polling`). **Opt-in
via `localControl: true` (default off).** When off, behavior is unchanged (pure
cloud). When on, the plugin controls/reads each reachable unit directly and falls
back to the cloud per-unit; cloud streaming stays connected as the fallback.

**The local protocol** (`src/local-api.ts`) — a port of [pykumo](https://github.com/dlarrick/pykumo),
byte-for-byte identical to the `mitsubishi-comfort` library behind HA's integration,
and live-verified against real hardware:
- `PUT http://<ip>/api?m=<token>` (plain HTTP). Body `{"c":{"indoorUnit":{"status":{...}}}}`.
  A status read sends empty leaves; the unit echoes values back under `"r"`.
- `computeLocalToken()`: two SHA-256s over an 88-byte buffer (a fixed `W_PARAM`
  constant + `sha256(password ‖ body)` + `0x0840` + `S_PARAM=0` + a shuffled slice
  of the cryptoSerial).
- Local field names differ: `mode` (not `operationMode`), `vaneDir` (not
  `airDirection`). **No `power` field — `mode:"off"` is off.** `filterDirty` /
  `defrost` / `standby` are in the local status; **humidity is not** (it's a separate
  sensors/MHK2 query, sensor-equipped units only) so it stays cloud-sourced.
- `LocalKumoClient`: a per-device request mutex (the adapter tolerates ~one
  concurrent local connection — pykumo locks, the HA lib dropped it, we keep it) and
  a forgiving `Promise.race` timeout (node-fetch v3 dropped the `timeout` option).

**Credentials** (two per device, both already reachable from the cloud):
- `password` (base64) — arrives ONLY in the `adapter_update` Socket.IO event we
  already subscribe to (captured in `kumo-api.ts`, still stripped from logs).
- `cryptoSerial` (hex, 9 bytes) — `GET /devices/{serial}/status` (`getDeviceCryptoSerial`).

**Discovery** (`discoverDeviceIps`): the cloud provides neither IP nor MAC, so the
plugin sweeps the host's /24 and matches each device to the adapter that
authenticates its token (`r.indoorUnit` = match, `_api_error` = other Kumo unit).
~5–30s for a /24 (verified: found all 5 units). `localControlIps` config skips the
sweep for listed serials.

**Integration:**
- `platform.initLocalControl()` runs in the background after streaming connects:
  waits for passwords, pairs with cryptoSerials, resolves IPs, starts local polling
  (`localPollInterval`, default 15s). `getHostIpv4()` derives the subnet (prefers
  private-LAN over CGNAT/VPN like Tailscale).
- `accessory.sendDeviceCommand()`: local-first, cloud fallback (a failed/unreachable
  local send falls through to cloud).
- `accessory.updateFromLocal()`: feeds a local read into `processZoneUpdate` (source
  `'local'`), preserving streaming-sourced humidity.
- **Local-authoritative:** while a local poll arrived within 45s, cloud updates are
  dropped so the cloud's ~7–10s lag can't clobber fresher local data.
- Code: `src/local-api.ts`, `platform.ts:initLocalControl/getHostIpv4/startLocalPolling`,
  `accessory.ts:sendDeviceCommand/updateFromLocal`, `kumo-api.ts:onAdapterPassword/getDeviceCryptoSerial`.

**Operational note:** child-bridge accessories get their config from the *parent*
homebridge process. Toggling `localControl` requires a **full homebridge restart**
(restart the main process), not just a child-bridge restart — the child reloads code
but not config.

## Development Notes

### Testing Streaming

Test files in repo (not committed):
- `test-streaming.ts` - Basic Socket.IO connection test
- `test-streaming-v2.ts` - Full streaming test with subscriptions

### Building and Running

```bash
npm run build          # Compile TypeScript
npm run watch          # Watch mode for development
sudo systemctl restart homebridge  # Restart to test changes
```

### Debugging

Enable debug mode in config to see:
- API request/response details
- Streaming event logs
- Token refresh operations
- Device update processing

Logs location: `/var/lib/homebridge/homebridge.log`

## Known Issues and Limitations

1. **Streaming initial messages:** When devices are first subscribed, we receive messages without full data (roomTemp undefined). Fixed in v1.3.0 - warnings suppressed during initial state.

2. **Mode switching:** AUTO mode uses `spAuto` setpoint, but some units don't support it (value is null). Fallback needed.

3. **Reconnection:** Socket.IO attempts to reconnect automatically, but max 5 attempts. After that, adaptive polling continues ensuring devices remain responsive.

4. **2FA Publishing:** npm publish requires passkey/OTP authentication. Use GitHub Actions workflow for automated publishing on release.

## Future Improvements

1. ~~**Conditional polling:** Only poll when streaming disconnected~~ ✅ **Implemented in v1.3.0**
2. **Better error handling:** More graceful degradation when API unavailable
3. **Humidity sensor:** Automatically add humidity sensor accessory when available
4. ~~**Fan mode:** Support fan-only mode~~ ✅ Exposed as a separate `Switch` service per accessory
5. **Config UI:** Add streaming status indicator in Homebridge UI

## Version History

- **1.7.0** - Local LAN control + 0.1°C setpoint step (June 2026)
  - **Opt-in local control** (`localControl: true`, default off): control/read each unit directly over the LAN, falling back to cloud per-unit; cloud streaming stays as the fallback. Modeled on HA's `mitsubishi_comfort` integration. See the "Local LAN Control" section
  - New `src/local-api.ts`: the pykumo token algorithm (live-verified against real hardware — a signed status read returned 200, and a command was accepted), `LocalKumoClient` (per-device mutex + forgiving timeout), command/status mapping (`mode`/`vaneDir`, no `power`, 0.1 rounding), and LAN discovery (sweep + token-match, since the cloud gives no IP/MAC)
  - Credentials reuse what we already see: local `password` from the `adapter_update` socket event (was stripped + discarded), `cryptoSerial` from `/devices/{serial}/status` (was fetched + unused)
  - Local-authoritative status: while a local poll is fresh (≤45s), cloud updates are dropped so the cloud's ~7–10s lag can't clobber it
  - **0.1°C setpoint step** (`minStep` 0.5→0.1 on TargetTemperature + the AUTO threshold handles): HomeKit is Celsius-native, so 0.5 forced "72°F" to snap to 22.5°C and read back as 73°F in the Kumo app. 0.1 lets 72°F store as ~22.2°C and round-trip faithfully. Live-verified the units honor 0.1°C (the cloud stored a 23.3 setpoint exactly). Applies to the cloud path too
  - Live-verified end-to-end on the Pi: 5/5 units discovered + controlled locally, polling at 15s, zero errors; the deployed module's read + command both round-tripped against hardware
  - `node:test`: `test/local-api.test.js` (13 cases) + `test/local-integration.test.js` (6 cases) — token, command builder, status mapping, subnet enumeration, local-first routing, cloud fallback, local-authoritative drop. 48 tests total green
  - Code: `src/local-api.ts`, `platform.ts`, `accessory.ts`, `kumo-api.ts`, `settings.ts`, `config.schema.json`
- **1.6.0** - AUTO-mode dual setpoints (June 2026)
  - In AUTO the Home app now shows a temperature range (two handles) instead of a single collapsed setpoint. Exposes the optional `HeatingThresholdTemperature` (↔ `spHeat`, low/heat edge) and `CoolingThresholdTemperature` (↔ `spCool`, high/cool edge) on the Thermostat service
  - Before: in AUTO the plugin returned only the single `TargetTemperature`, which fell back to `spHeat` because these units report `spAuto: null` — so the cooling edge of the band was invisible and unsettable
  - Live-confirmed (real account + Pi): all 5 units report `autoModeDisable: false` (auto IS supported) and `spAuto: null` (so AUTO uses the `spHeat`/`spCool` band, not a single center). End-to-end on Front bedroom via config-ui-x: AUTO engaged, cooling handle → `{spCool}` and heating handle → `{spHeat}` independently (no clobber), cloud held the band across a streaming reconcile
  - Writes are independent and inherit the 1.5.2 powered-off guard (cache + echo, no `modeRequiredWhenDeviceOff` 400) + revert-on-failure. Zone/streaming updates sync both handles. `TargetTemperature` and the HEAT/COOL/DRY paths are untouched (additive change)
  - Characteristics added in the constructor so they publish via the normal discovery path; props set from the device profile range in `applyDeviceProfile`
  - `node:test` regression (`test/auto-setpoint.test.js`, 9 cases): read sync, independent spHeat/spCool writes, the two-handle drag staying two-sided, off-guard, and heat/cool controls proving no regression. 29 tests total green
  - Code: `accessory.ts:getHeatingThresholdTemperature / getCoolingThresholdTemperature / setThresholdTemperature / applyDeviceProfile / processZoneUpdate`
- **1.5.3** - Route the Dry-mode setpoint to `spCool` (June 2026)
  - Fixed: in Dry mode the plugin read and wrote the temperature setpoint to `spHeat`, but the Kumo v3 cloud keeps the dry setpoint in `spCool` (there is no `spDry` field). So dry-mode temperature changes silently did nothing — the cloud accepted the `spHeat` write but the unit ignored it, and out-of-range values 400'd with `invalidSpHeatRange`. Reads surfaced the wrong field (e.g. a unit in dry reporting `spCool=25, spHeat=23` showed 23°C)
  - Live-confirmed (real account, `app-prod.kumocloud.com/v3`): four dry captures held the setpoint in `spCool`; `GET /devices/{serial}/profile` returns `usesSetPointInDryMode: true`; a `POST /devices/send-command {commands:{spCool:24}}` round-trip was adopted and the unit stayed in dry (no flip to cool, no `operationMode` needed)
  - Fix: explicit `dry` branch in both `setTargetTemperature` (write → `{ spCool }`) and `getTargetTempFromStatus` (read → `spCool`), gated on a new `dryUsesSetpoint()` helper. Surfaced `usesSetPointInDryMode` from the `profile_update` payload (was dropped) into `DeviceProfile`. The gate defaults to "has a setpoint" until the async profile loads, so the common case works immediately; units reporting `usesSetPointInDryMode: false` stay setpoint-less (write falls through to the heat branch, read uses the existing fallback)
  - HomeKit: corrective + additive. A dry unit reads as `TargetHeatingCoolingState === 0` (OFF) on the Thermostat, so the stock Home app surfaces no dry-setpoint UI; this fixes the value/route for clients that read the raw `TargetTemperature` characteristic. Heat/cool/auto untouched. The 1.5.2 off-guard is unaffected (a dry unit has `power===1, operationMode==='dry'`)
  - `node:test` regression (`test/dry-setpoint.test.js`): dry write→`{spCool}`, dry write before profile loads→`{spCool}`, gated-false dry→`{spHeat}`, cool/heat controls, dry read→`spCool`, gated-false read→fallback. Proven to fail the 3 core cases against the pre-fix build
  - Code: `accessory.ts:setTargetTemperature / getTargetTempFromStatus / dryUsesSetpoint`, `settings.ts:DeviceProfile`, `kumo-api.ts:profile_update handler`
- **1.5.2** - Don't send a setpoint to a powered-off unit (June 2026)
  - Fixed: setting a TargetTemperature while a unit is off sent a bare `{ spHeat }` with no `operationMode`, which the Kumo v3 API rejects with `modeRequiredWhenDeviceOff` (HTTP 400). Every such attempt logged a cluster of red errors (`Request failed with status: 400` → `Send command failed` → `Failed to set target temperature`)
  - Real-world trigger: a HomeKit automation/scene that turns the AC off (e.g. "off when the skylight opens") captures each thermostat's *full* state, so firing it re-pushes the last setpoint alongside `off`. The `off` succeeded; the trailing setpoint on the now-off unit produced the 400s. The "all units, same second, `HomeKit sent`" log signature distinguishes a controller-pushed burst from a user tap
  - Fix: `setTargetTemperature` now short-circuits when `power === 0 || operationMode === 'off'` — it caches the value and echoes it to HomeKit (so the slider holds) without sending a doomed command. Heat/cool/auto paths unchanged
  - `node:test` regression (`test/setpoint-while-off.test.js`): off → no command sent (failed pre-fix with `1 !== 0`), off → value still echoed, heat → setpoint still sent (control)
  - CI: bumped `actions/checkout` and `actions/setup-node` to `@v5` in `publish.yml` ahead of the 2026-06-16 Node-20 runner deprecation (no functional change to publishing)
  - Code: `accessory.ts:setTargetTemperature`
- **1.5.1** - Publish runtime-added features to HomeKit (June 2026)
  - Fixed: the fan-only switch (since 1.4.0), the dry switch (1.5.0), the humidity characteristic, and the filter indicator were all added to the accessory *after* it was published to the bridge (from async `profile_update` / first-reading callbacks) but never re-published — so they existed in memory and the HAP cache but never reached the Home app
  - Root cause: no `api.updatePlatformAccessories([accessory])` call after a runtime structural change. Centralized in `accessory.ts:publishStructureChange()`, called at every add/remove site (switches, humidity, filter)
  - `node:test` coverage extended (`test/switch-publish.test.js`) — asserts a re-publish happens on switch add/remove and on the first humidity reading; proven to fail against the pre-fix build
  - **Operational caveat:** publishing the service is necessary but not always sufficient. HomeKit controllers cache an accessory's *service list* and only re-read it when the bridge's configuration number (`c#`) increases. iOS will not surface services added to an already-paired accessory until its cache is cleared — a full **device reboot** (clears the `homed` cache) or removing/re-adding the child bridge. Force-quitting the Home app or restarting a Home hub is not enough.
  - Child bridge accessories persist to `accessories/cachedAccessories.<username-without-colons>` (e.g. `cachedAccessories.0EA3CB05C3A2`), NOT the main `cachedAccessories`
  - Code: `accessory.ts:publishStructureChange and its 6 call sites`
- **1.5.0** - Dry (dehumidify) mode as a Switch (June 2026)
  - Exposes dry mode as a separate `Switch` service per thermostat (subtype `dry`), mirroring the fan-only switch (#14)
  - Capability-gated on `profile.hasModeDry`; a cached switch is removed if the device reports no dry support
  - Switch ON → `sendCommand({ operationMode: 'dry', power: 1 })`; OFF → `{ operationMode: 'off', power: 0 }`
  - Fan-only and dry are mutually exclusive: engaging one optimistically flips the other off, with streaming/polling as the backstop
  - HomeKit's Thermostat service has no dehumidify state, so (like fan-only) the thermostat shows OFF while dry is active; the unit's dry setpoint (`usesSetPointInDryMode`) can't be exposed through an on/off switch
  - Code: `accessory.ts:setupDrySwitch / removeDrySwitch / setDryOn / isDryActive`
- **1.4.1** - Self-healing device discovery (May 2026)
  - Fixed: a transient login/network failure at startup (e.g. a DNS blip) left the plugin idle until a manual restart — `discoverDevices()` logged the error and returned with no retry, so streaming never started
  - `discoverDevices()` now retries with exponential backoff (30s → 5min cap) and keeps retrying indefinitely, recovering on its own once connectivity returns
  - Retry is idempotent: an `accessoryHandlers` guard prevents double-registering devices across attempts
  - A transient empty zones response no longer unregisters every cached accessory as "stale" — it retries instead
  - Added `node:test` regression tests (`test/discovery-retry.test.js`, run via `npm test`)
  - Code: `platform.ts:34-38, 107-112, 136-176`
- **1.4.0** - Humidity stabilization, fan-only mode, v3 API docs (May 2026)
  - Fan-only mode exposed as a separate `Switch` service per thermostat (#11)
  - Stabilized humidity characteristic and documented v3 API endpoints (#13)
  - Added debug logging to the token refresh flow (#12)
- **1.3.6** - Streaming events, device profiles, filter maintenance, model number (March 2026)
  - Listen for `profile_update`, `device_status_v2`, `adapter_update`, `acoil_update` streaming events
  - Account-level Socket.IO subscription + `force_adapter_request` emits to trigger profile/status data
  - JWT user ID extraction for account-level subscribe (required for adapter_update events)
  - `DeviceProfile` interface stores per-device capabilities (modes, fan speeds, vane, setpoint limits)
  - HomeKit TargetTemperature now enforces correct min/max from device profile (e.g., 17-30°C)
  - Devices report "Not Responding" in HomeKit when `device_status_v2` reports disconnected
  - Adapter firmware version and WiFi RSSI logged (password stripped from logs)
  - HomeKit FilterMaintenance service shows filter dirty status from `displayConfig.filter`
  - Model number extracted from streaming `device_update` and set on AccessoryInformation
  - Extended `DeviceStatus` with `modelNumber`, `connected`, `standby`, `defrost`, `filterDirty`
  - Cleaned up verbose raw JSON logging (debug-level only)

  - Code: `kumo-api.ts:34-39, 616-742`, `accessory.ts:21-22, 123-200`, `settings.ts:7, 81-86`
- **1.3.5** - Token refresh jitter to prevent rate limits (January 2026)
  - Added random 0-60 second jitter to token refresh timing

  - Initial connections and actual errors remain at info level
  - Cleaner logs when streaming is working normally
- **1.3.3** - Streaming architecture improvements (January 2026)
  - Socket reconnect after every token refresh (ensures fresh token is used)
  - Added 10-second hysteresis before exiting degraded mode
  - Added 20-second socket connection timeout
  - Removed unused vestigial code (reconnectAttempts, lastStreamingUpdate)
  - Added device serial validation before subscribe
  - Suppresses spurious "STREAMING INTERRUPTED" during planned reconnects
  - Code: `kumo-api.ts:39-40, 796-827`, `platform.ts:25-27, 343-458`

## CI/CD

### GitHub Actions Workflow

Automated npm publishing on GitHub releases:
- File: `.github/workflows/publish.yml`
- Trigger: publishing a GitHub release (or manual `workflow_dispatch` for testing)
- Authentication: npm Trusted Publishing (OIDC) — no `NPM_TOKEN` secret required
- Includes provenance for supply chain security

**OIDC requirements (don't break these):**
- Workflow needs `permissions: id-token: write`
- Runner needs npm CLI >= 11.5.1 (the `Upgrade npm for trusted publishing` step installs `npm@latest`)
- Do NOT add `registry-url`/`NODE_AUTH_TOKEN` to `setup-node` — they make npm expect a token and break OIDC (this caused E404-on-PUT auth failures through v1.4.1, which were worked around by manual `npm publish`)
- A Trusted Publisher must be configured for the package on npmjs.com (package → Settings/Access): GitHub org/user `burtherman`, repo `homebridge-mitsubishi-comfort`, workflow `publish.yml`, environment blank
- `package.json` `repository.url` must match the trusted-publisher repo

**Runner Node deprecation — resolved in 1.5.2 (2026-06-09):** `actions/checkout` and `actions/setup-node` are pinned to `@v5` (Node 24 runtime), ahead of GitHub's 2026-06-16 force-migration of `@v4` (Node 20) and the 2026-09-16 removal of Node 20 from runners. No further action needed; keep both at `@v5` (or newer) going forward.

**To publish a new version:**
1. Bump version: `npm version patch/minor/major --no-git-tag-version`, commit
2. Push to `main`
3. Create a GitHub Release at the `vX.Y.Z` tag — the Action publishes to npm automatically
