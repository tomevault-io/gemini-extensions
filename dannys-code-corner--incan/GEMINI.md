# Agent Instructions for Incan Development

Incan is a Python-like language that compiles to Rust. The compiler itself is written in Rust and generates native Rust code via an IR-based pipeline. This document contains guidance for AI agents working on the codebase.

> **CRITICAL — NO `.unwrap()` / `.expect()` ANYWHERE.** This is the single most important rule.
> Multiple modules enforce `#![deny(clippy::unwrap_used)]` and `#![deny(clippy::expect_used)]`.
> This applies to **all** code — production, tests, examples. No exceptions, no shortcuts.
> Use `?` with `Result`-returning test functions, or propagate errors explicitly.
> See [Error handling in tests](#error-handling-in-tests) for the correct pattern.

> **CRITICAL — THE USER DECIDES WHAT IS RELEVANT.** Scope, PR boundaries, and which files “belong” on a branch are **the maintainer’s call**, not the agent’s. Never label work as “unrelated PR noise,” “cleanup,” or “hygiene” as a reason to remove or revert it. Always check with the user when in doubt.
>
> **FORBIDDEN without explicit user approval that quotes the exact paths or commands:** anything that overwrites or deletes uncommitted work — including `git checkout -- <path>`, `git restore <path>`, `git clean`, `git reset --hard`, `stash drop`, or equivalent. If you believe files should be split, reverted, or left out of a PR, **state that and ask**; do not run destructive git operations on your own initiative.
>
> **Commits and pushes:** The maintainer commits code unless they **explicitly** ask you to run `git commit` or `git push`. Implement and test in the working tree; offer a suggested commit message as text. The `/start-work` skill states the same rule.

## General Workflow

1. **Branch from main**: Create a feature branch using the naming convention `<type>/<issue>-<slug>`, where type is `feature`, `chore`, or `bugfix`. Examples: `feature/165-implement-rfc-031-library-system-phase-1`, `chore/88-vocab-drift-guardrails`, `bugfix/42-fix-parser-crash`. Use the `/start-work` skill to automate this.
2. **Follow RFCs**: RFCs in `workspaces/docs-site/docs/RFCs/` are the spec — implement exactly what they say.
3. **Run tests**: `make test` must pass before considering work complete. Run targeted tests during development; run the full suite when you finish.
4. **Update snapshots**: `INSTA_UPDATE=1 cargo test --test codegen_snapshot_tests` to update changed snapshots.
5. **Boy Scout Rule**: Leave every file you touch in better shape than you found it — fix stale TODOs, missing doc comments, unused imports, misleading names.
6. **Documentation gate (mandatory)**: Before finalizing any change, audit every touched Rust module and ensure rustdocs are present and accurate for all new/changed functions and methods in changed Rust source files. This is enforced mechanically by `scripts/check_changed_rustdocs.py` through `make pre-commit-fast` and `make pre-commit`.

### Pattern intake before edits

Before touching production code, tests, or docs for a non-trivial change, do a short pattern intake:

- Identify the active area: parser, typechecker, lowering, emission, stdlib, CLI/tooling, docs, or tests.
- Read 2-3 nearby files that already implement the same kind of behavior. Prefer same-stage and same-domain precedents over generic Rust examples.
- Name the source-of-truth boundary or registry when one exists, such as the RFC, stdlib registry, diagnostics catalog, ownership policy, or CLI contract.
- State which verification path must prove the change, including whether parser/typechecker coverage, codegen snapshots, integration tests, docs build, or feature-specific builds are required.

Do not substitute broad advice like "follow Rust best practices" for local precedent. Incan patterns are stage- and boundary-specific; copying a shape from the wrong compiler layer is a common way to create drift.

### Rust compiler error intake

When debugging a Rust compiler error, capture the full error context before proposing a fix:

- the exact command that failed;
- the complete diagnostic, including error code, notes, help text, and secondary spans;
- active feature flags or build mode, especially default build vs. `rust-metadata`;
- the relevant function signature and nearby type definitions;
- the local files or tests that establish the intended pattern.

Classify the root cause before editing: lifetime/borrow across boundary, trait bound, feature gate/build-mode mismatch, orphan/coherence rule, missing import, or pipeline-stage wiring. Avoid applying a local `.clone()`, `.into()`, `.as_ref()`, or type annotation workaround until the owning boundary is clear.

### Common commands

## Docs-site Workflow (MkDocs Material)

When making changes under `workspaces/docs-site/`:

- **Build docs locally**: run `mkdocs build --strict` from `workspaces/docs-site` to catch broken links/anchors early.
- **Line length: no hard wrap** for docs-site `.md` files. Write prose as natural paragraphs — let the renderer handle wrapping. This applies to all markdown under `workspaces/docs-site/` and other non-code markdown files.

## Code Style

Read and follow [`workspaces/docs-site/docs/contributing/explanation/readable-maintainable-rust.md`] for the project's Rust coding conventions.

### Inline section headers

In longer functions (roughly 30+ lines or 3+ logical blocks), use `// ----` section headers to delineate logical blocks:

```rust
// ---- Context: stdlib module completions (`from std.` / `import std::`) ----
if let Some(stdlib_items) = stdlib_module_completions(&line_prefix) {
    return Ok(Some(CompletionResponse::Array(stdlib_items)));
}

// ---- Context: decorator completions (`@` at line start) ----
if let Some(decorator_items) = decorator_completions(&line_prefix) {
    return Ok(Some(CompletionResponse::Array(decorator_items)));
}
```

Guidelines:

- Keep a blank line **before** each header for visual breathing room.
- The label after `----` should describe *what* or *when*, not *how*.
- Don't overuse: if a function has only one or two simple blocks, a plain `//` comment is enough.
- These are for **intra-function** organisation. For module-level sections, use `// ============` banners.

### Formatting

- **Do not manually optimize Rust comment or rustdoc line length.** Agents do not need to worry about rustdoc line length at all; `make fmt` takes care of formatting.
- **Do not introduce staircase-wrapped prose** in `///`, `//!`, or prose `//` comments. Avoid mechanically chopping one paragraph into many short lines.
- **Keep Rust prose comments paragraph-shaped.** Break lines only when structure requires it: bullets, tables, code blocks, deliberate emphasis, or a clean sentence/ clause boundary that genuinely improves readability.
- **Prefer fewer fuller lines over many short lines** in Rust prose comments. If a rustdoc paragraph reads like a narrow column, it is probably wrong.
- Use `make fmt` to format the codebase after making changes, and before running tests.
- If you touch comment prose that is already awkwardly short-wrapped, rewrite it as a natural paragraph before running `make fmt`; do not assume rustfmt will expand it for you.

### Documentation requirements (mandatory)

Agents must treat documentation updates as part of implementation, not optional polish.

- **Public API docs are required**: Any new/changed `pub` module, type, enum variant intent, struct field intent (when not obvious), and function/method must have rustdoc that explains purpose and contract.
- **Error types need variant-level docs**: For `thiserror` enums and diagnostic types, document what each variant represents and when it is emitted.
- **Non-trivial functions and methods need docs**: New or changed functions/methods should carry rustdoc/doc comments unless they are genuinely tiny and self-evident local helpers. Prefer documenting all touched functions over debating edge cases.
- **Cross-stage and boundary helpers always need docs**: Parser/typechecker/lowering/emission/interop/conversion helpers must document purpose, invariants, and why the boundary exists, even when they are private.
- **Tiny obvious helpers are the only exception**: A very small private helper may skip rustdoc only when its name and body make the intent completely obvious and there are no invariants, fallback paths, ownership assumptions, or feature-gated behaviors to explain.
- **Behavioral boundaries must be explicit**: For pipeline boundaries (parser -> desugar -> typecheck -> lowering), docs should state what must and must not cross the boundary.
- **Docs should explain why, not narrate syntax**: Explain purpose, contracts, fallbacks, ownership/borrowing assumptions, and misuse risks. Avoid comments that merely restate the code line-by-line.
- **Rust prose comments should not be manually hard-wrapped for width**: when editing `///`, `//!`, or prose `//` comments, keep the prose natural and let formatting tools do their job. Short, choppy comment wrapping is considered a documentation defect.
- **Changed Rust source functions and methods must have rustdoc**: the mechanical gate checks changed Rust source files and fails if a function or method definition lacks a preceding rustdoc block.
- **Done criterion**: Do not mark work complete until this rustdoc audit is done for all touched files.

## Rust Anti-Patterns to Avoid

The project style guide covers broad principles. This section is a concrete quick-reference of patterns agents **must not** introduce.

| Instead of                                    | Prefer                                 | Why                                                               |
| --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.unwrap()` / `.expect("…")` **anywhere**     | `?`, `.context()`, or explicit `match` | Panics crash the compiler; deny lints reject these in CI          |
| `.clone()` to appease the borrow checker      | Restructure ownership or borrow        | Hides design issues and adds unnecessary allocations              |
| `&String`, `&Vec<T>`, `&Box<T>` in parameters | `&str`, `&[T]`, `&T`                   | More general — accepts owned and borrowed callers alike           |
| `x as u32` (silent truncation)                | `x.try_into()` or `From`/`Into`        | `as` silently wraps/truncates; conversions should be explicit     |
| `use foo::*` (wildcard imports)               | `use foo::{Bar, Baz}`                  | Makes origins clear; avoids surprise breakage on upstream changes |
| `.collect::<Vec<_>>()` just to re-iterate     | Chain iterators directly               | Avoids an unnecessary allocation + copy                           |
| `pub` on everything                           | `pub(crate)` or private by default     | Minimize public surface; promote visibility only when needed      |
| Blocking I/O in `async fn`                    | `tokio::fs`, `spawn_blocking`          | Blocks the executor and starves other tasks                       |
| `Result<T, String>` in public APIs            | A typed error enum (`thiserror`)       | Stringly-typed errors are hard to match and evolve                |
| `Rc<RefCell<T>>` everywhere                   | Restructure data / ownership           | Usually signals a design that fights the borrow checker           |

### Error handling — NEVER use `.unwrap()` or `.expect()`

**This is non-negotiable.** Any `.unwrap()` or `.expect()` call — in production code **or test code** — will be rejected by clippy and fail CI. Always propagate errors with `?`:

```rust
// WRONG — will not compile due to deny lint
let file = File::open(path).unwrap();

// CORRECT — propagate with ?
let file = File::open(path)
    .map_err(|e| miette!("failed to open {}: {e}", path.display()))?;
```

#### Error handling in tests

Test functions that perform fallible operations **must** return `Result` and use `?`:

```rust
// CORRECT — return Result, use ?
#[test]
fn my_test() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let tmp = tempfile::tempdir()?;
    fs::create_dir_all(tmp.path().join("src"))?;
    Ok(())
}
```

### Clippy is mandatory

Run `cargo clippy` and fix warnings before submitting.

### Agents

Subagents in `.agents/` run as isolated specialists that can be delegated to:

| Agent        | When it's used                                   | What it does                                                  |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `test-suite` | Validating changes, checking regressions, pre-PR | Analyzes diff, runs targeted tests, checks snapshots + clippy |

## Implementation Learnings

Past RFC and issue implementations produced reusable insights. These are maintained in [`.agents/learnings.md`]. **Read the relevant section before starting work on any RFC implementation or any change that touches the parser, typechecker, or lowering stages.**

- **RFC 021** — Field Metadata & Aliases: pipeline flow, typechecker-vs-lowering pitfalls, scope restrictions, reflection helpers
- **RFC 005** — Rust Interop: parser warnings, LSP/CLI wiring, `Program` struct stability
- **RFC 022** — Stdlib Namespacing & Soft Keywords: lexer-vs-parser responsibilities, per-file activation, registry-driven validation
- **Issue #116** — Parenthesized Multi-line Imports: lexer bracket tracking, shared parsing helpers, formatter idempotency
- **RFC 023** — Frontend Bounds & Extern Diagnostics: generic bounds in symbols, call-site checking, namespace-driven stdlib activation

## Release Notes Style

When updating `workspaces/docs-site/docs/release_notes/*.md`:

- Use **structured sections**: "Features and Enhancements" vs "Bugfixes"
- Use **area prefixes** for scannability: `Models:`, `Compiler:`, `Tooling:`, `Docs:`
- Link to **PRs and issues**: `(#123, #456)` for traceability
- Keep entries **concise** (one-liner + context link)
- For **patch releases**: list all fixes; for **minor releases**: curate user-facing themes

Example: `- **Models**: Field aliases and metadata for schema-safe mapping ([RFC 021], #98)`
