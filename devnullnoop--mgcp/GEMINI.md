# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**MGCP** (Memory Graph Core Primitives) is a Python MCP server providing persistent, graph-based memory for LLM interactions. The system stores lessons learned during LLM sessions in a graph structure, allowing semantic querying without loading full context histories.

**Status**: v2.1.0 - Alpha/Research project. Phases 1-7 complete, actively dogfooding. Phase 8 (skill compilation) removed — degraded reliability.

## Documentation Preferences

When creating diagrams, charts, tables, or other visuals, use HTML documents with visualization libraries:
- **Diagrams/Flowcharts**: mermaid.js
- **Charts/Graphs**: chart.js
- **Tables**: HTML tables with CSS styling

Avoid ASCII art diagrams in documentation. HTML visuals are easier to digest for a wider audience.

## Technology Stack

- Python 3.11+ with virtual environment (`.venv/`)
- FastMCP for MCP server framework
- NetworkX for graph operations
- Qdrant for vector storage (lessons + catalogue + workflows)
- sentence-transformers for local embeddings (`BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5`, 768 dimensions)
- Pydantic for data validation
- SQLite + JSON for persistence
- FastAPI for web dashboard

```

## Architecture

The system flows from Claude/LLM through MCP Protocol to the MGCP Server, which contains Query Handler, Lesson Manager, and Graph Walker components. These connect to dual storage backends: Graph Store (NetworkX) and Vector Store (Qdrant).

### Core Components

All source files are in `src/mgcp/`:

- `server.py` - MCP server with 37 tools

### Data Model

**Lessons** have hierarchical relationships (parent/child) and typed cross-links. Key fields:
- `trigger`: When the lesson applies (keywords/patterns)
- `action`: What to do (imperative)
- `tags`: Categorization for retrieval

**Project Contexts** persist across sessions with:
- Todos with status tracking
- Active files being worked on
- Recent decisions
- Notes about current state

**Project Catalogues** store project-specific knowledge:
- Architecture notes and gotchas
- Security notes with severity/status
- Conventions (naming, style, structure)
- File couplings (files that change together)
- Decisions with rationale
- Error patterns with solutions

## Claude Code Integration

Add to Claude Code MCP config (`~/.claude.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mgcp": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["-m", "mgcp.server"],
      "cwd": "/path/to/MGCP"
    }
  }
}
```

Data is stored in `~/.mgcp/` by default.

## Claude Code Hooks

MGCP v2.2 makes the routing prompt **data, not code**. The intent classification system has 8 intent categories (`git_operation`, `catalogue_dependency`, `catalogue_security`, `catalogue_decision`, `catalogue_arch_note`, `catalogue_convention`, `task_start`, `session_end`) defined in `~/.mgcp/intent_config.json`. Both Claude Code hooks and the REM intent_calibration operation read from this file. Adding or modifying an intent no longer requires editing hook code or shipping a release — you edit the JSON (or call `add_intent` / `update_intent` MCP tools, or let REM propose the change) and the next session picks it up automatically.

| Hook | Event | Type | Purpose |
|------|-------|------|---------|
| `session-init.py` | SessionStart | advisory | Inject routing prompt + intent-action map (loaded from `intent_config.json`) plus workflow instructions |
| `user-prompt-dispatcher.py` | UserPromptSubmit | advisory | Hard keyword gates (loaded from `intent_config.json` — both git AND session_end fire from one loop), terse routing re-injection, scheduled reminders, workflow state, per-turn enforcement state reset, `MGCP_BYPASS` token detection |
| `pre-tool-dispatcher.py` | PreToolUse | **enforcing** | Refuses `git commit`/`git push` Bash calls unless `mcp__mgcp__query_lessons` ran in the same turn. Uses `shlex(punctuation_chars=True)` for quote-aware tokenization so `grep 'git commit' docs/` does not false-positive. Bypass per turn with `MGCP_BYPASS` in the user prompt. |
| `post-tool-dispatcher.py` | PostToolUse | advisory | Routes by tool: Edit/Write triggers knowledge-capture checkpoint; Bash triggers error detection with cooldown; `mcp__mgcp__query_lessons` flips the per-turn flag consumed by PreToolUse |
| `mgcp-precompact.py` | PreCompact | advisory | Critical reminder to save context (and write_soliloquy) before context compression |

Advisory hooks fall back to a minimal hard-coded intent set if the JSON file is missing or corrupt, so a fresh install never crashes. The PreToolUse hook fails open (allows the tool call) on any parse error — enforcement is a net, not a tripwire. Legacy regex hooks (`git-reminder.py`, `catalogue-reminder.py`, `task-start-reminder.py`) are archived in `examples/claude-hooks/legacy/`.

**Advisory vs. enforcing.** The first four hooks inject text into `<system-reminder>` tags that the LLM may skim or ignore. `pre-tool-dispatcher.py` is different: it returns `permissionDecision: "deny"` with a `reason` string and the Claude Code harness refuses to run the tool. This addresses the repeated failure mode where `query-before-git-operations` was violated (v1→v4) despite correct hook fires. See `docs/mgcp-interception-flow.html` for the full interception map and remaining enforcement gaps.

**Growth loop:** REM intent_calibration runs community detection on the lesson graph and surfaces findings when (a) a community has unmapped tags or (b) a community spans multiple intents with no clear dominant (< 60% share) — the latter check catches misfit clusters that the v2.1 hand-coded `tag_to_intent` map silenced via defensive over-mapping. Findings include structured `proposed_patch` metadata so the LLM (or a future automated writeback path) can call `add_intent`/`update_intent` directly. Lesson community → REM finding → intent_config update → next session's hook injection picks up the new intent. No code commit required.

**Intent → Skill compilation (v2.3):** An intent + its linked workflow + the workflow's per-step lessons can be compiled into an Anthropic-format SKILL.md file at `~/.claude/skills/{intent_name}/SKILL.md` (user scope) or `<project>/.claude/skills/{intent_name}/SKILL.md` (project scope). The compiler walks intent → workflow → ordered steps → lessons-per-step and inlines all four layers into a single self-contained document. Compiled skills give intents two new firing channels — slash commands (`/git_operation`) and Claude's auto-discovery via description matching — on top of MGCP's hook-level keyword gates and LLM intent classification.

**Critical anti-Phase-8 invariant:** compiling a skill is purely additive. It does NOT remove the source intent from `intent_config.json`, it does NOT remove backing lessons from the active query pool, and it does NOT change any MGCP behavior. The intent stays the source of truth and the skill is a downstream artifact you can recompile any time. This is the inverse of Phase 8's failure mode, where graduated lessons were hidden from `query_lessons` (degrading reliability). The web UI badges compiled skills as "fresh" or "stale" by comparing the skill file mtime against the intent_config.json mtime and the backing lessons' `last_refined` timestamps, so users know when to recompile.

## Implementation Roadmap

1. ~~Phase 1: Basic lesson storage and retrieval via MCP~~ Complete
2. ~~Phase 2: Semantic search with embeddings~~ Complete
3. ~~Phase 3: Graph traversal and hierarchical structure~~ Complete
4. ~~Phase 4: Refinement, versioning, and learning loops~~ Complete
5. ~~Phase 5: Quality of Life~~ Complete - Multi-client support, export/import, backup/restore, proactive hooks
6. ~~Phase 6: Proactive Intelligence~~ Complete - Intent-based LLM self-routing, REM intent calibration, workflow state management
7. ~~Phase 7: Feedback Loops~~ Complete - REM cycle engine (staleness scan, duplicate detection, community detection, knowledge extraction), versioned context history, lesson version snapshots, scheduled reminders
8. ~~Phase 8: Skill Compilation~~ **Removed** - Degraded reliability by hiding lessons from active querying. Hook-based injection outperforms skill files.
