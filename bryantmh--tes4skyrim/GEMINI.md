Convert TES4 (Oblivion) master/plugin files to TES5 (Skyrim) format.

| Stage | Package | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| Export | `tes4_export` | Reads TES4 binary, dumps every record to KEY=VALUE text. **Pure dump — no transformations.** |
| Import | `tes5_import` | Reads the text, writes a binary TES5 ESM/ESP. **All TES4→TES5 transformations live here.** |
| Assets | `asset_convert` | Meshes, textures, SpeedTree, collision, sound, LOD, BSA packing |
| Scripts | `script_convert` | TES4 script → Papyrus |

`convert.py` orchestrates all stages. Quick start:

```bash
python convert.py -f Oblivion.esm      # full pipeline for one file
python -m pytest tests/test_import.py -v
```

See [docs/pipeline_reference.md](docs/pipeline_reference.md) for all commands,
caching, skipped record types, the export text format, and the directory layout.

## Critical Rules

### Process

- **Do one bug at a time.** Make the edits before moving to the next. If you find
  another bug while investigating, fix it too.
- **Work in the order the prompt presents.** Highest priority first.
- **Never stop mid-task to report or ask.** Finish everything, verify, then reply.
- **All fixes must be generic.** Never patch to satisfy a single record or file.
  Oblivion and Nehrim are only the test files — we never know what plugin this
  runs on.
- **The goal is COMPLETE conversion.** Don't strip things out because the
  conversion would be complicated.
- **If you don't see the problem described, the test data is not stale** — there
  is always a REAL problem to find.
- **Census vanilla before calling something wrong.** If Skyrim.esm or the DLCs do
  the same thing at scale, it is legal and is not your bug — several docs record
  "verified vanilla-legal, don't fix this" for exactly the things that looked
  broken. Conversely, "all 3,740 vanilla records write 0 here" is the strongest
  possible evidence for what to write.
- **Prefer the engine's own mechanism over a Papyrus/script approximation.** Force
  greet is a package, not a function call; `SetAlert` is native, not
  `DrawWeapon()`. Check for a real equivalent before declaring one absent — the
  wikis under-document both games.
- **A symptom's cause is often several layers from the symptom.** Frozen NPCs have
  traced to navmesh, condition params, package data, and behavior graphs in turn.
  Confirm the mechanism before fixing; a plausible story that explains the symptom
  is not yet a diagnosis.
- <a id="master-blindness"></a>**IF THE PLUGIN HAS MASTERS, SUSPECT MASTER-EXPORT
  BLINDNESS FIRST.** Morrowind_ob and the ESPs depend on Oblivion.esm (Nehrim and
  Oblivion are standalone). The recurring defect: an import phase indexes only
  `by_type` — the CURRENT plugin's export — and never consults
  `ctx.master_export`, so an actor's master-owned packages, items, scripts or
  refs resolve to nothing and the feature silently dies.
- Don't preserve backwards compatibility. Delete code that is no longer used.
- Keep files under ~1000 lines; split by responsibility when one grows.
- <a id="tools-first"></a>**CHECK `tools/` BEFORE BUILDING ANYTHING BESPOKE.**
  ~95 tools already exist and one probably answers your question — the full
  catalogue is [docs/python_tools_reference.md](docs/python_tools_reference.md).
  The order is:
  1. **Use** the existing tool.
  2. If it *almost* fits, **extend or fix it** — new flags, wider output. Never
     write a parallel script that duplicates a tool's job, and never leave a
     broken tool in place while working around it.
  3. Only if nothing is close, write a new one — and **add its entry to
     `python_tools_reference.md` in the same pass**, before you report back. An
     undocumented tool is one the next session will rebuild from scratch.
- Put throwaway files in `temp/`. Don't write one-off scripts with hardcoded
  output — `tools/` scripts take arguments and produce general output, so they are
  reusable next time.
- **Always record new learnings** in this file or, more likely, the relevant `docs/` file.
- Docs can be wrong: they sometimes describe fixes that were never implemented.
  Grep the source before claiming a mechanism exists, and fix the doc.
- If using subagents, ONLY use the lower tier Sonnet or Haiku models. NEVER Opus. Limit additional agents to only 2 at a time.
- When building test scripts, always output as they go so that if the time goes past the hard 120 second timeout limit you still get some output. When running the real pipeline and not a test script this limit doesn't apply. For example when you are done with your work and rebuilding.
- **LISTEN CAREFULLY to EXACTLY what the user's prompt says**. Seek to understand any implementation ideas instead of using your pre-conceived notions
- If you need to continue iterating on an idea with only marginal improvments in some areas and regressions in another, your idea is likely incorrect and you need to find another one
- **Look for the AUTHORED indicator** If you need to resort to heuristics, your approach is most likely incorrect. Remember, everything in the original plugin works for a reason
- **Pay close attention to performance** This needs to run quickly on a modest PC. If your new code makes a step run significantly slower than it did before you **MUST optimize**. Python first optimizations, and then native C++ if necessary.
- If the user gives multiple constraints to a bug, your fix MUST satisfy ALL of them

### <a id="regression-read-the-commits"></a>🛑 IF IT IS A REGRESSION, READ THE COMMITS

**"This used to work" / "this is a recent regression" means the cause is ON A
`+` LINE IN A RECENT DIFF. Go read the diffs. That is the entire method.**

```bash
git log --oneline --since=3.days                 # candidates
git show <sha> -- script_convert/ tes5_import/   # READ THE + LINES
```

Read the changed *logic* and ask "what does this make the output do
differently?" A regression cannot come from code that did not change, so the
broken code is sitting in that window waiting to be read.

**Do NOT do any of these before you have read every candidate diff:**

- **Rebuilding the plugin at an old commit to A/B artifacts.** Minutes per
  build, and `git checkout <sha> -- <paths>` **WRITES THE INDEX** — it silently
  staged 30 files and violated the never-stage rule.
- **Writing probe scripts to dump and compare records.** The probe is usually
  wrong. One reported records "identical" while the raw bytes went 21120 → 786.
- **Re-examining the same record from new angles.** That is a loop, not
  progress.
- **Concluding "nothing changed in this window, so it must be older."** That is
  almost always a broken tool or the wrong artifact — not proof.

**A generated `.psc`/`.pex` is an artifact too.** `--import-only` does NOT
regenerate scripts, so a script-side regression stays invisible until
`--scripts-only` runs. If the symptom is behavioural, suspect the generated
Papyrus and read `script_convert/` diffs.

(2026-08-06: the user said "check the commits" in their first message and
repeated it five more times while I kept measuring instead. Hours lost. The bug
was one readable hunk in `script_convert/pipeline.py` — a sequence gate wrapped
around a fragment body including its `SetStage`, so an out-of-turn fragment
applied nothing and the CharacterGen conversation stalled forever.)

### Verifying your work

**Always check theories against several of these** before acting:

1. The Skyrim executable at `D:\Other Games\Skyrim Anniversary Edition\SkyrimSE.exe`
   — this is the GOG/AE build and is **NOT DRM-packed**, so it disassembles
   statically. (Only the *Steam* copy is encrypted, `.text` entropy 8.00 — don't
   confuse the two and conclude the exe is unreadable.) Crash logs from the Steam
   build map across via the Address Library (stable ID → per-build RVA). Don't be wary of dissassembly. It doesn't have to be the last resort!
2. The Oblivion/Nehrim install at `D:\Other Games\Nehrim At Fate's Edge\Data`.
3. xEdit source at `references/xEdit` — `Core/` documents the binary structure of
   every record type. This is the first stop for any format question. Or if working with meshes, go to the Nifskope source at `references/Nifskope`
4. The Skyrim.esm dump at `references/Skyrim.esm`, real Skyrim.esm, and
   `references/Skyrim Meshes`. **Verify binary layout against BOTH the xEdit
   definition AND a real Skyrim.esm dump — never skip either.**
5. UESP / CK wiki via `python tools/uesp_lookup.py`. **Never WebSearch or
   WebFetch for these** (they 403). An empty result means fix the query.
6. A web search for other authoritative sources.
7. The Papyrus logs from the last in-game run — read them to diagnose a runtime
   symptom (see the directory-purpose table under Hard prohibitions).
8. Failing all the above, add comprehensive logging so the user's next run
   captures everything needed. Make it thorough — one wasted round trip costs the
   user a full build-and-play cycle, and their time is far more valuable than
   yours.

Never attribute a bug to LE-vs-SSE mesh format differences — verify engine
theories externally first.

### Hard prohibitions

- **NEVER `git stash` / `git stash pop`** in this repository.
- **NEVER `git commit` or `git push`.** The user commits after in-game testing.
- **NEVER `git add` / `git rm`** (staging, including staged deletions). Use plain
  `rm`. `git reset` destroys the user's own staging.

  <a id="staging-is-single-use"></a>**Authorization to stage is SINGLE-USE and
  CHUNK-SCOPED.** An explicit "go ahead and stage" covers **that one staging
  action and nothing after it**. It does not carry to your next edit, the next
  turn, or the end of the session — the next time you want to stage, you need a
  new explicit instruction. Specifically:
  - **Stage HUNKS, never whole files.** Stage only the chunks you just wrote.
    A file you edited almost always contains the user's own uncommitted work
    too, and `git add <file>` silently swallows it into your commit's scope.
    Use `git apply --cached` with a patch limited to your hunks.
  - **NEVER `git add -A` / `-u` / `.`** — no exceptions, ever.
  - **Never re-stage "to be helpful"** after a later edit. Staging you were not
    asked for a second time is a violation even if the first one was authorized.
  - If you are unsure whether the authorization still applies, it does not.
    Leave the index alone and say so in your final report.
- **NEVER go snooping in the live, heavily-modded SSE install.** It is full of
  other mods' assets, so nothing you find there tells you anything about this
  converter. In particular: **never inspect it to check whether your changes were
  deployed or installed correctly** — trust the user's deployment statements, and
  never argue with an in-game result by reading their setup.
  Each external directory has ONE sanctioned purpose:
  | Path | Use it for | Not for |
  |---|---|---|
  | `D:\Other Games\Skyrim Anniversary Edition\` (GOG/AE) | exe decompilation | assets, deployment checks |
  | Oblivion / Nehrim LE install | BSA files and NIFs | anything Skyrim-side |
  | The modded SSE install | **Papyrus logs, and reading `Skyrim.esm`** | everything else, especially verifying deployment |
- **Never run the full pytest suite** — only the tests for files you changed.
- **KEEP EVERY TEST COMMAND / SCRIPT UNDER 120 SECONDS. Never set a long timeout.** If a command
  needs minutes, you have picked the wrong scope — narrow it instead: one cell,
  not a worldspace; 2-3 NIFs, not a tree; one record type, not the whole plugin;
  the per-cell tool (`navmesh_tri_check --cell X`) instead of the batch sweep.
  Most tools take `--cell` / `--max N` / `--workers` for exactly this. A long
  timeout burns the user's wall-clock and usually hides a scoping mistake; if
  something genuinely cannot be scoped down, say so instead of waiting on it.
- If file recovery is in progress, make zero writes to the affected drive; ask
  first before any bulk operation.
- **NEVER stop in the middle of an incomplete task to give a mid-session update**
  I don't want to know. I want you to complete the task you have been given

### Working with the user

- **NEVER STOP TO GIVE A MID-SESSION STATUS REPORT.** Not "here's where I am",
  not "should I continue?", not a summary of progress so far. Finish the whole task, then report once. A status update mid-task is a failure, not politeness. If something the user has asked for remains unsolved, YOU ARE NOT DONE!

  <a id="no-stopping"></a>**The stop rule has NO exceptions. Low confidence is
  not one.** Every violation of this rule in practice has come from the same
  place: being wrong two or three times in a row, losing confidence, and
  reaching for confirmation before "wasting" another build cycle. That instinct
  feels like diligence. It is the exact failure this rule exists to prevent —
  the moment you most want to stop is the moment stopping costs the user most.
  The tradeoff is ALREADY DECIDED: **the user would rather you finish and be
  wrong than stop and ask.** Do not re-derive that decision. It is not yours.

  These are all violations, no matter how they are phrased:
  - "I'd rather confirm the diagnosis before proceeding, given my track record"
  - "Two paths here, which do you want?" (pick the better one and say why in the
    final report)
  - "Want me to X, or stop at Y?" — just do X
  - Ending a turn with findings + a question instead of findings + a finished fix
  - "I haven't started it — say the word and I'll go" — you had the word already
  - A summary that *reads* complete but leaves the task unfixed
  - **"I found the real cause but haven't built the fix"** — the diagnosis is
    the easy half. Build it.
  - **Confessing a bad track record as the reason to stop** ("I've been wrong
    five times, I won't claim a sixth without validating"). This is the most
    seductive form because it sounds like integrity. It is a stop.

  <a id="honesty-costume"></a>**A STOP IN THE COSTUME OF HONESTY IS STILL A
  STOP.** (2026-08-05, sixth violation in one session.) After five wrong theories
  on silent creatures, the correct root cause was found — zero IPDS/IPCT/FSTP/
  FSTS records — written up, and then *handed back unbuilt* with "I'd rather tell
  you that plainly than hand you another 'verified' rebuild that turns out silent
  again." The user's reply: "NEVER STOP NEVER STOP NEVER STOP... WHY DO YOU KEEP
  STOPPING?" Naming your own unreliability does not buy permission to quit — it
  is the low-confidence trigger with better prose. **One finished task is worth
  more than every apology combined.**

  **Uncertainty is reported, never resolved by asking.** If you are unsure,
  state the assumption plainly IN THE FINAL REPORT, having already done the
  work under it. If two approaches are viable, implement the one you'd defend
  and note the alternative at the end. If part of the task is genuinely blocked,
  finish every unblocked part, then say exactly what was blocked and why.
  A question is only ever permitted when proceeding would be UNSAFE or
  DESTRUCTIVE (deleting the user's data, force-pushing, writing during a
  recovery) — never because you are unsure whether your fix is right.

  **Being wrong repeatedly does not earn a check-in — it obligates you to keep
  going.** Go back to the sources in "Verifying your work", find a DIFFERENT
  mechanism, implement it, build it, and report once at the end.
- **Measure the invariant the user asked for, not a proxy for it.**
- **Trust the user's in-game test results as ground truth.** Never question
  whether they tested something, and never rebut a reported result with file
  timestamps or a reconstructed timeline. (Reading Papyrus logs to *diagnose* is
  encouraged — using them to dispute the user's report is not.)
- **BUILD EVERY FILE YOUR CHANGES TOUCH, before reporting back.** The user should
  be able to launch the game and verify immediately — never leave them to work out
  which stage to re-run, and never hand back a change that only compiles in
  theory. Map the files you edited to stages and run each one into `output/`:

  | Changed | Run |
  |---|---|
  | `tes4_export/` | `python convert.py -f <plugin> --export-only` |
  | `tes5_import/` (records, navmesh, packages, dialogue) | `--import-only` |
  | `script_convert/` | `--scripts-only` (compiles .psc → .pex) |
  | `asset_convert/nif_converter.py`, collision, skin | `--meshes-only` |
  | `spt_*` | `--speedtrees-only` |
  | sound conversion | `--sounds-only` |
  | LOD | `--lod-only` |
  | BSA packing | `--pack-only` |

  Touching several areas means running several stages — import *and* scripts if
  you changed both. Other flags: `--creatures-only`, `--extract-only`,
  `--prune-textures-only`, `--pack-zip-only`. Report what you built and any
  failures verbatim; if a stage genuinely cannot be run, say which and why rather
  than staying silent.
- **NEVER START A BUILD UNTIL YOU ARE SURE THE FIX IS CORRECT.** Finish every
  edit, run the targeted tests, and re-read your own diff FIRST.
- **A FULL `--meshes-only` REBUILD IS LONG AND EXPENSIVE (~20,000 meshes, many
  minutes at 100% CPU). Never launch one lightly.** Rebuild ONLY the meshes your
  change actually affects. Ressrve the full stage for changes that genuinely touch every mesh, and say so when you run one.
- **Build the mesh the user named, in the PLUGIN the user named** If they say a mesh is a Nehrim issue, rebuild it under `Nehrim.esm` even if there is a same-named mesh under `Oblivion.esm`
- **Never run two CPU-saturating jobs at once.** While a build is running, do not
  start pytest, a mesh sweep, or a second build — they fight for every core, both
  take longer, and the machine becomes unusable. Wait for the completion
  notification, then run the next thing. While waiting, WAIT — don't burn tokens
  on filler work.
- **While iterating on a repeated failure, don't write tests, update docs, or ANYTHING until
  the fix is CONFIRMED in-game.** Each round trip costs the user a full
  build-and-play cycle, so spend it on the diagnosis and the candidate fix only.
  Tests and docs written against an unconfirmed theory usually just encode the
  wrong theory and have to be rewritten. Once the user confirms, then add the
  regression test and the doc note.
- **When a fix doesn't work, don't continue to re-apply a variant of the same theory without new evidence.** Two
  failed attempts on one theory likely means the theory is wrong — go back to the
  sources in "Verifying your work" and find a *different* mechanism. Say plainly
  that the previous explanation was wrong rather than layering another guess on
  top of it.
- **Report honestly.** If something is untested, say so; if you skipped part of
  the scope, say which part and why. Never describe an unverified change as
  working.

### Assets and references

- **`references/` is for comparison/analysis ONLY — the pipeline must NEVER
  resolve runtime assets through it.** Vanilla Skyrim files are fetched via
  `asset_convert/skyrim_assets.py` (cache in `export/skyrim_assets/`, else
  auto-extracted from the SSE BSAs via registry-detected install).
- `references/` subfolders (`NIFConverter/`, `xEdit/`, `UESP/`, `nifskope`) are
  other projects — reference only.
- **LE assets are SSE-compatible.** Never dig through SSE-format assets/BSAs.
  BSA meshes are SSE-format; read them with `asset_convert/sse_nif.py`
  (`read_nif` converts BSTriShape graphs to LE NiTriShape graphs in-memory;
  pyffi Patch 8 supplies the SSE read layouts). Output is always written LE
  (uv2=83), which SSE loads natively.
- **The LE-compatibility rule above does NOT extend to `.hkx`: every hkx we ship
  is 64-bit.** `convert_hkx_to_amd64()` is the mandatory final step
- Use `references/nif [version].xml` for valid Skyrim NIF behavior — newer and
  more correct than pyffi 2.2.3's bundled version. Use pyffi with the clock
  monkey patch when analyzing.
- **Never batch-test many NIFs.** Test 2-3 specific to the bug. If a batch is
  genuinely required, use full workers (`cpu_count() - 1`) — single-threaded runs
  cap at 10 NIFs. Compare an `output/` mesh against the `export/` mesh and a few
  similar Skyrim meshes.

### Performance and memory

- Use multiprocessing, not threads, for pure-Python work; **ThreadPoolExecutor is
  only for I/O and subprocesses.** The output ESM must stay byte-reproducible.
  Rules and measured results: [docs/performance_notes.md](docs/performance_notes.md).
- **Never exhaust memory**: some pool tools load the ~2.1 GB export index per
  worker. Cap `--workers` or run single-process.
- **<a id="formid-drift"></a>NEVER CAUSE FORMID DRIFT — AND SAY SO IF YOU DO.**
  `alloc_formid()` is a bare `+1` counter, so an id is set purely by its call's
  POSITION: add/remove/reorder ONE earlier allocation and every later id shifts,
  silently corrupting every save. Add new generators at the END, never delete a
  "dead" allocation, never unwrap a `sorted()` around a set. If a change shifts
  ids anyway, **lead the final report with it** (types, rough count, why it was
  unavoidable) — never bury it, never accept drift for tidiness. Guarded by
  `tests/test_formid_determinism.py`; details and the per-file fragility map:
  [performance_notes.md#formid-fragility-map](docs/performance_notes.md#formid-fragility-map).

### Output paths

`output/Oblivion.esm` is a **FOLDER**, not a file — the .esm goes in
`output/Oblivion.esm/Oblivion.esm`. A write failure there means you are trying to
overwrite a folder with a file, not that a file is locked.

### <a id="shared-navmesh-cache"></a>The shared navmesh cache

Navmesh generation is the slowest import stage. Results are cached per cell in
`export/<plugin>/navmesh_geom_cache/*.pkl`, and that cache is **published as a
GitHub Release asset** so downloaders don't regenerate it — not committed
(git keeps every version of a churning binary forever) and not Git LFS (free
tier: 1 GB bandwidth per *month*, about three clones).

```bash
python tools/navmesh_cache.py verify  --plugin Oblivion.esm   # publishable?
python tools/navmesh_cache.py install --plugin Oblivion.esm   # get the cache
python tools/navmesh_cache_hook.py --install                  # gate pushes
python tools/navmesh_cache_hook.py --run                      # publish manually
```

- **NEVER ship `collision_cache.bin`.** It maps Oblivion mesh *paths* to
  verbatim Havok collision triangles lifted from Bethesda's NIFs — derived
  asset data keyed by asset name. Only the generated `navmesh_geom_cache`
  pickles (hash + verts + tris + ledges, our own output) go in the archive, and
  the manifest carries just a one-way hash of the collision cache to prove a
  local build matches. Same reason archiving names the cache dir explicitly:
  globbing `export/**/*.pkl` would sweep in the ~2.1 GB index pickles.
- **Invalidation is per mesh, not per file.** Each cell's hash folds in the
  collision digest of only the meshes *that cell places*
  (`collision_extract.collision_digest`), so replacing a few meshes costs only
  the cells that use them. It used to hash the whole collision file, where one
  changed mesh invalidated all ~8,200 Oblivion entries.
- **The cache tag must stay machine-independent.** It hashes the navmesh
  sources only. It previously folded in `collision_cache.bin`'s *mtime*, which
  is machine-local and survives neither git nor an unzip — every downloader
  computed a different tag and the shared cache would have missed 100% of the
  time. Never reintroduce mtime, absolute paths, or worker counts into any
  cache key.
- **`CACHE_TAG` is written only by a real, failure-free generation pass.**
  Computing the tag must never stamp it, or reading the tag would certify a
  stale cache as fresh. A stale entry always regenerates, so a wrong cache is
  *slow*, never *incorrect*.
- The pre-push gate only runs on **direct pushes to master** (a PR merged in
  GitHub's UI runs no local hook) — CI cannot validate a cache built from
  gitignored `export/` data. Use `--run` for the PR case.
