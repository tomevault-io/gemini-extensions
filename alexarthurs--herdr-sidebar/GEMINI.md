# herdr-sidebar monorepo

**This file is a living doc — always capture findings.** Whenever you discover something
non-obvious the hard way (a herdr behavior, a Windows quirk, a manifest gotcha, a build issue),
record it here in the relevant section before finishing the task, the way the Windows caveats
below were captured. If you're working in a feature worktree, commit the CLAUDE.md update on
your branch so it lands on main with the merge.

One herdr plugin, a VS Code-style sidebar for the terminal, as a **self-contained Rust crate**:

- `plugins/herdr-sidebar` — file explorer + source control in ONE binary (ratatui TUI).
  Unified mode shows both views in a single "Sidebar" pane with an activity-bar switcher
  (in-process, instant); the ⚙ settings can split them into separate Explorer /
  Source Control panes (`--view explorer|git` pins a pane's starting view). `--preview`
  runs the file-preview pane. Views live in `src/explorer_app.rs` / `src/scm_app.rs`
  (bin modules); shared pieces (icons, ipc, launch parsing, state, ui helpers) are lib
  modules — nothing is copy-mirrored anymore.

There is deliberately **no root cargo workspace**: `herdr plugin install <owner>/<repo>/<subdir>`
treats the subdirectory as the plugin root, and each plugin's `herdr-plugin.toml` points at
`./target/release/<bin>` — a shared workspace would hoist `target/` to the repo root and break
that path. Keep every crate buildable standalone from its own directory.

## Build / test / lint

Run from inside the plugin directory, not the repo root:

```
cd plugins/herdr-sidebar
cargo build --release
cargo test
cargo clippy -- -D warnings
```

## Plugin dev workflow

- `herdr plugin link .` (from the plugin dir) registers the local checkout with the running
  herdr; `herdr plugin list --json` shows what's registered.
- `herdr plugin action list` / `herdr plugin action invoke <plugin>.<action>` run manifest actions.
- `herdr plugin log list --plugin <id>` shows plugin logs.
- Manifest format: `herdr-plugin.toml` (`[[build]]`, `[[panes]]`, `[[actions]]`).
- herdr.dev/docs/plugins lists an `[[actions]]` `contexts` field as REQUIRED, but no
  working plugin ships it (checked herdr-file-viewer, herdr-spreader, ours, herdr-notes)
  — doc/implementation drift; leave it out.

### Reference implementations (installed locally, read these before designing)

- `%APPDATA%\herdr\plugins\github\herdr-file-viewer-c993314e2614\` — a mature git-aware file
  viewer plugin (ratatui). Its `herdr-plugin.toml` header documents hard-won **Windows
  findings** — read it before touching manifests.
- `%APPDATA%\herdr\plugins\github\herdr-spreader-f248c87aa2e2\` — minimal manifest + layout tool.
- herdr source: https://github.com/ogulcancelik/herdr — **if you run into issues integrating a
  plugin** (manifest not loading, pane spawn failures, action/IPC behavior that doesn't match the
  docs), read the open-source herdr code there to see what the host actually does, rather than
  guessing from error messages.

### Windows caveats (verified by herdr-file-viewer against herdr 0.7.1)

- herdr **cannot spawn a relative `[[panes]]` command on Windows** — it resolves the program
  against herdr's own directory and fails with ERROR_PATH_NOT_FOUND. Windows launches must go
  through an action script that spawns the binary **by absolute path** (`pane split` +
  `pane run`), locating the plugin root via `herdr plugin list --json` (strip the `\\?\` prefix).
- Action ids must be **globally unique** across platforms — use `-windows`-suffixed ids for
  the Windows variants and gate both with the item-level `platforms` key.
- herdr panes on this machine run **Windows PowerShell 5.1**: chain with `;` / `if ($?)`,
  never `&&`.
- **PS 5.1 mangles native-command arguments containing double quotes** — even inside a
  single-quoted here-string: `git commit -m @'…"quoted text"…'@` splits the message at the
  embedded `"` into multiple pathspec args (bit an agent live). Write multi-line/quoted
  commit messages to a temp file and use `git commit -F <file>` instead.
- **PS 5.1 prepends a UTF-8 BOM when piping into a native process's stdin** (`$json | my.exe`
  delivers `EF BB BF{...}`; verified live by both plugins). serde_json rejects a BOM before
  `{`, so anything parsing herdr JSON from stdin must strip a leading `\u{feff}` first (see
  `strip_bom` in both plugins' `launch.rs`).
- `cargo build --release` fails with **os error 5 (Access is denied)** while the plugin's TUI is
  running in a pane — Windows locks running exes. Close/quit the pane first, rebuild, relaunch.
- **Propagating a rebuild to every workspace**: plugin registration is global (one `plugin link`
  serves all workspaces), but stale panes keep old binaries AND a dead-but-open Explorer/Sidebar
  pane blocks the ensure hook's re-dock (it matches by label/token, not liveness). Run
  `herdr plugin action invoke herdr-sidebar.redeploy-windows` after rebuilding: it closes
  every herdr-aa pane in every workspace, kills stragglers, and re-docks the focused workspace;
  the others re-dock via the focus hook the moment they're next visited.

### herdr behavior findings (verified live against herdr 0.7.1)

Pane geometry & CLI semantics:

- `pane split` only goes `right|down`. **Left-docking a pane** = split the tab's leftmost pane
  right, then `pane swap --source-pane <new> --target-pane <leftmost>` to move the new pane into
  the left slot.
- `pane split --ratio` is the **original pane's share** (the new pane gets `1 - ratio`).
- After `pane swap`, **focus follows the SLOT, not the pane**: whichever pane now occupies the
  previously-focused slot is focused. Auto-open scripts that split the focused pane must hand
  focus back afterwards (`pane focus --direction right --pane <new>`).
- `pane resize --amount` is a **split-RATIO delta**, not columns (herdr `layout.rs`
  `resize_focused`: `current_ratio ± delta` on the nearest split). Convert columns to ratio via
  the split's rect from `pane layout`. Ratios clamp at **0.1 minimum**, which bounds how narrow
  a pane can get. The socket API's `layout.set_split_ratio` ({pane_id?, tab_id?, path:[bool],
  ratio}) sets a split's ratio absolutely (path [] = the tab's root split) — but it clamps to
  the SAME 0.1 floor (requested 0.04, server set exactly 0.1; verified live). There is **no way
  to make a pane narrower than 10% of the tab** short of patching herdr — which is why the
  sidebar HIDES (closes) rather than collapsing to a sliver. (Panes inside a NESTED split can be narrower than 10% of the
  window — the floor is per-split-rect — but the sidebar's column is a root-split child.)
- There is no focus-by-id; focusing a pane is a `pane zoom <id> --on` / `--off` cycle.
- `pane send-keys` accepts only a limited key-name set: `Up`/`Down`/`Enter`/`Escape`/`Tab`
  and plain characters work, but `Home` is rejected with `invalid_key` and
  `PageDown`/`PgDn`/`page-down`/`pgdn` are all rejected as unsupported too. Give TUIs
  single-char fallbacks (`g`/`G` for Home/End) so they stay drivable via send-keys.
- A `pane list` snapshot goes stale the moment you `pane close` a pane: if the closed pane
  was the focused one, the old snapshot still reports it as focused, so deriving a
  split/layout target from it yields `pane_not_found`. Re-run `pane list` AFTER any close
  before computing where to open a replacement pane (bit both notes launchers' REPLACE path).
- Panes are **tab-scoped only**. Plugin pane placements are exactly
  `overlay|popup|split|tab|zoomed` — plugins cannot add workspace-level chrome (e.g. a real
  sidebar next to herdr's own); the closest approximation is a per-tab dock via event hooks.
  There is also no way to insert a pane at a tab's layout root: a full-height left column is
  only achievable by docking while the tab still has a single pane.

Manifest `[[events]]` hooks (undocumented in CLI help; see herdr `src/api/schema/events.rs`):

- `[[events]]` entries (`on`, optional `platforms`, `command`) run a command on
  `workspace.*` / `worktree.*` / `tab.*` / `pane.*` events (`plugin_hook_event_names()` is the
  allowed list); the event payload arrives in the `HERDR_PLUGIN_EVENT_JSON` env var.
- **Focus events fire in bursts** (one tab switch emits `tab.focused` AND `workspace.focused`,
  sometimes more) and hook invocations run concurrently: an unguarded ensure-pane hook opened
  FOUR duplicate panes on one switch. Serialize hook bodies with an atomic `mkdir` lock (with a
  stale-lock timeout) and snapshot `pane list` only after acquiring it.
- Never hook `pane.*` events from a script that itself creates panes — feedback loop.

Pane environment: `HERDR_PANE_ID` is set inside every pane's shell; `HERDR_BIN_PATH` is injected
for **actions/hooks but not panes** — fall back to `herdr` on PATH. A binary started via
`pane run` gets no `HERDR_PLUGIN_CONTEXT_JSON`; root it from its cwd (pass `--cwd` at split).

Console flashes from hooks (Windows 11, verified live):

- Any **console process in a hook/action chain briefly flashes a Windows Terminal window**
  when WT is the default terminal — even though herdr spawns plugin commands with
  CREATE_NO_WINDOW. Two hooks per tab switch made every pane-focus flash multiple windows.
  Fix: keep the whole chain GUI-subsystem — `wscript //B scripts/x.vbs` (PATH-resolvable, no
  console) launching a Rust sidecar built with `#![cfg_attr(windows, windows_subsystem =
  "windows")]` that talks to the **socket API directly** and spawns nothing.
- Hook/action commands run with **cwd = plugin root** (`runtime.rs` sets `current_dir`), so a
  relative script **argument** (`scripts/x.vbs`) resolves — the *program* itself still cannot
  be a relative path (resolved against herdr's own dir).
- Rebuilds fail while any plugin exe is running; stray TUI processes can outlive their closed
  panes — `Get-Process herdr-sidebar | Stop-Process` before `cargo build --release`.

Socket API (what the CLI wraps; usable directly from plugins, no subprocess needed):

- Windows: open `\\.\pipe\<HERDR_SOCKET_PATH>` as a plain read+write file; unix: connect to
  `$HERDR_SOCKET_PATH` as a unix socket. One request per connection: write
  `{"id":"…","method":"pane.split","params":{…}}\n`, read one JSON line back. Responses have
  the same shape the CLI prints, so CLI-output parsers work unchanged.
- The API is richer than the CLI: `pane.focus {pane_id}` focuses **by id** (the CLI only has
  the zoom-cycle hack). `pane run` = `pane.send_input {pane_id, text, keys:["Enter"]}`.
- Method names/params: `herdr api schema --json`, or `src/api/schema*` in the herdr source.

Mouse in plugin TUIs: herdr forwards clicks/motion/wheel to a pane app that enables mouse
capture — but **right-click is always intercepted** for herdr's pane context menu unless the
click carries the modifier configured in `[ui] right_click_passthrough_modifier` (config.toml;
e.g. `"ctrl"` → Ctrl+right-click reaches the app with ctrl stripped; a modifier is required,
plain-right-click passthrough is not supported). Same-tab `pane.move` is a deliberate no-op
(`SameTab`) — restructure within a tab by bouncing the pane through `--new-tab` and back
(herdr auto-closes the emptied temp tab).

Pane identity & titles:

- `pane.report_metadata {pane_id, source, tokens:{name:value}}` attaches **metadata tokens**
  that show up in `pane.list` — a durable pane identity that survives label changes. The
  sidebar TUI tags its pane this way so its detection works while the label is cleared.
- `report_metadata` **MERGES** the token map: sending `tokens: {}` is a no-op, it does NOT
  clear previously-reported tokens. To remove a token, report it with an explicit **null
  value** (`tokens: {name: null}`) — verified live. Token values must be **strings** —
  numbers are rejected with `invalid_request` (and a `let _ =` swallows it silently). A `source` can also report tokens whose
  keys belong to another plugin's namespace (the merged Sidebar pane reports both plugins'
  identity tokens so both launchers recognize the one pane).
- Pane border titles come from `border_label`: metadata title → manual label (`pane rename`)
  → detected-agent label. The raw terminal (OSC) title is NOT used — clear the label on a
  non-agent pane and the border shows **no title at all**.
- `layout.apply` does NOT edit a tab in place: it materializes the tree into a **new tab with
  new panes** (and clamps ratios to the same 0.1–0.9 as everything else). Not a way around
  the ratio floor, and it leaves a duplicate tab to clean up.

herdr config: `%APPDATA%\herdr\config.toml`; `herdr server reload-config` applies edits to
the running server ("status":"applied" + diagnostics in the reply).

Terminal fonts for icon glyphs (Windows, verified live):

- Nerd Font "**Mono**" builds squeeze icons into one cell (tiny); the **non-Mono** build
  ("CaskaydiaCove Nerd Font") draws them up to double-width — use it when icons look too small.
- Match the font by its **DirectWrite/typographic family name** (name-table ID 16, e.g.
  "CaskaydiaCove Nerd Font Mono"), NOT the GDI name System.Drawing reports ("CaskaydiaCove
  NFM") — VS Code/WT silently fall back to tofu with the wrong one. Newly installed fonts
  need a VS Code window reload to be seen.
- **A TUI cannot detect whether the terminal font renders a glyph** — missing glyphs
  (tofu) still occupy their cells, so cursor-position probing sees nothing. The icon
  theme therefore resolves env → persisted `icons` in state.json → a "Nerd Font
  installed?" probe (Windows font registries via `reg query` / `fc-list` elsewhere),
  and any manual toggle persists (`set_theme`) so a wrong guess is corrected exactly
  once. Installed ≠ selected in the terminal profile: switching WT color schemes via
  the settings UI can silently DROP profiles.defaults.font, reverting the terminal to
  a non-Nerd font while the probe still says material (bit Alex live).
- First run without a Nerd Font: `fontsetup.rs` shows a fullscreen install offer
  (winget on Windows with a curl+bsdtar+HKCU-registry fallback; curl+unzip into the
  user font dir on mac/Linux), on a background thread so the heartbeat keeps beating.
  Answer persists as `font_prompt` in state.json; `HERDR_SIDEBAR_FONT_PROMPT=force|off`
  overrides for testing. Verified live both ways (decline → emoji; install → winget
  registered the family machine-wide). UX invariants (user-reported clip on a fresh
  machine: a ~34-col pane cut the copy off after "Download and install", so the Y/N
  affordances were invisible and the prompt read as static text): every screen
  re-wraps to the pane width and drops blocks lowest-priority-first when short —
  the keycap options ([Y]/[N], and [C] copy on failure) are NEVER dropped; only an
  explicit N/Esc/q declines (stray keys are ignored, Enter = Y); the failure screen
  shows the error plus the exact manual command (`winget install
  DEVCOM.JetBrainsMonoNerdFont` on Windows) copyable with `c`; Esc during a hung
  install stops waiting WITHOUT persisting a theme, so the next start re-probes.
  Test hooks: `HERDR_SIDEBAR_FONT_INSTALL=fail|ok` simulates the installer outcome
  (~2s delay, no real install), and pointing `HERDR_PLUGIN_STATE_DIR` at a scratch
  dir keeps the GLOBAL state.json out of live tests. The prompt also stamps the
  pane's identity heartbeat itself (`ipc::report_identity`, shared with both apps'
  PaneCtl): it runs BEFORE the app loop's first stamp, and a token-less "Sidebar"
  pane older than the launcher's ~6s wait gets REPLACE-killed by the corpse rule
  while the user is still reading the question.
- **WT's bundled Cascadia (checked 1.24: CascadiaCode.ttf/CascadiaMono.ttf) contains NO
  Nerd Font glyphs** — F07B/F0674/E725/E628 all absent from their cmaps (verified with
  fontTools). The "Cascadia now includes Nerd Font symbols" release is the separate
  "NF" variant, which WT does not ship. So there is NO zero-install path to material
  icons, and a "running under WT ⇒ assume glyphs" heuristic would be wrong.
- Sextants (U+1FB00 Symbols for Legacy Computing) and braille are covered by the Cascadia
  family; arbitrary glyph rotation is impossible in terminals — herdr can forward Kitty
  graphics to the host terminal, but Windows Terminal doesn't render that protocol.

Building herdr itself from source (for local patches): needs Zig ≥ 0.15.2 on PATH or via
`ZIG=<path>` (build.rs compiles the vendored `libghostty-vt`); the 0.15.2 zig build failed on
this machine with the known Zig-0.15-Windows linking issue mentioned in libghostty's
HACKING.md — budget time for that before promising a patched build.

### Terminal/TUI gotchas (both plugins)

- **crossterm honors `NO_COLOR`** — and Claude Code's Bash tool sets `NO_COLOR=1`, so a
  herdr SERVER (re)started from an agent shell passes it to every pane it ever spawns and
  all crossterm-drawn UI silently goes monochrome (raw-SGR output still renders, which
  makes it look like a plugin bug; bit Alex live). Both TUIs + the viewer now call
  `crossterm::style::force_color_output(true)` at startup — a TUI's colors are interface,
  not pipeable output. Claude panes inside such a server stay pale until the server is
  restarted from a clean (non-agent) shell.

- Without keyboard-enhancement protocols (not enabled in herdr panes), **modifier+Enter is
  indistinguishable from plain Enter** in most Windows terminals — a "Ctrl+Enter" binding
  silently means "Enter". Design keymaps so unmodified keys suffice (the commit
  box accepts plain Enter for this reason).
- **AltGr arrives from Windows as CONTROL|ALT on the Char event** in crossterm (no AltGr
  normalization): a guard like `modifiers.contains(CONTROL) => shortcut, return` silently
  swallows `@ { [ ] } \` on German/French/Nordic layouts. Treat CONTROL+ALT chars as text
  to insert, only CONTROL-without-ALT as a shortcut.
- Emoji with variation-selector (VS16) sequences render at inconsistent widths across
  terminal emulators and break column alignment — the shared icon map avoids them; keep it
  that way when adding icons.

### Pane liveness (heartbeat tokens)

- **You cannot detect a dead TUI from outside**: `pane.process_info` shows only the shell
  in the foreground group whether the TUI child is alive or not (verified live), and a dead
  pane keeps its label AND metadata tokens — which used to block the ensure hook's re-dock
  forever. The fix: every TUI **re-stamps its identity token with the unix time** (string!)
  every ~5s; launch decisions treat a stamp older than `HEARTBEAT_STALE_SECS` (20s) — or a
  "Sidebar" label with no token at all — as a corpse and return `REPLACE <id>`: close the
  pane, dock a fresh one. Ensure hook and all launcher scripts handle it.
- **Server-restart resume creates corpses that NO event heals by itself**: herdr
  restores panes with their labels and scrollback, but the process inside is a fresh
  shell and metadata tokens are gone; restore and client attach emit NO hookable events
  at all (verified live — tab.created/workspace.created/pane.focused all silent).
  The fix is two-part: (1) label-without-token now counts as a corpse for ALL our
  labels (Sidebar/Explorer/Source Control/Preview), and (2) the ensure hook also runs
  on `pane.focused` + `tab.created` + `workspace.created`, so the user's FIRST
  interaction after attach heals the tab. Hooking pane.* from a pane-creating script
  is only safe because `open()` now HOLDS ITS LOCK until the spawned TUI stamps its
  token — without that wait, queued hook invocations see the fresh label-only pane and
  replace it before it boots: an infinite replace loop (observed live, dozens of panes
  churned). The separated-pane launcher scripts carry the same wait.
  Cleaner alternative (herdr-notes v0.1.1 does this): the LAUNCHER stamps the
  identity token itself, synchronously, right after `pane.split` and BEFORE
  `pane run` — there is then no token-less window at all, so no wait/poll is
  needed. Worth adopting if the launchers are ever reworked.
- **Stamp the heartbeat on EVERY event-loop iteration, not only in the poll-timeout
  branch**: sustained input with <500ms gaps (held-key auto-repeat, a long paste) keeps
  `event::poll` returning true, starving a timeout-branch heartbeat until the launcher
  deems the live pane stale and REPLACE-kills it mid-edit. Same for a debounced autosave
  flush. Both self-throttle, so calling them unconditionally each iteration is free.
- **`pane close` kills the TUI process with no chance to flush** (no signal/console-close
  it can catch in practice) — any debounced-autosave state inside the debounce window dies
  with it. Toggle-off launchers should first drive a graceful save+quit via
  `pane send-keys <id> Escape q` (design the keymap so Esc-then-q saves and quits from
  every mode), short sleep, THEN `pane close` as the cleanup.

### Unified sidebar (see `src/state.rs`)

- Both views ship in ONE binary: the activity bar switches them **in process** (instant,
  no flash — the terminal session is held across switches). The old two-crate host/guest
  process-swap protocol is gone.
- User-facing wording is **"Unified sidebar: on/off"**, toggled in the ⚙ Settings modal
  (`s` key or the gear button) — never "merge"/"detach" in UI text, and the toggle is
  silent (the layout change is the feedback). Off spawns a second pane of the same binary
  pinned with `--view`, and each pane pins to its own view.
- The sticky setting lives in `HERDR_PLUGIN_STATE_DIR/state.json` (resolves to
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\herdr\plugins\herdr-sidebar\` here) per the herdr plugin docs; herdr
  injects that env for hooks/actions but NOT panes, so every `pane.split` we issue
  forwards it via the `env` param (`state::spawn_env`). Legacy
  `%APPDATA%\herdr\aa-sidebar.json` is migrated on first load. A fresh sidebar opens on
  the last-active view.
- The unified pane reports BOTH identity tokens (`herdr-sidebar-explorer`,
  `herdr-sidebar-git`) so either launcher decision finds it; turning unified off clears
  the other token (null value — report_metadata MERGES token maps).
- `c` (or "Change Folder…" in the context menu / both ⚙ Settings modals) re-roots the
  sidebar via the NATIVE OS folder picker (`rfd`, Windows IFileDialog / macOS NSOpenPanel;
  verified live on Windows). The dialog runs on a BACKGROUND thread polled from the event
  loop — a blocking call would freeze the TUI and the liveness heartbeat would declare the
  pane a corpse after 20s. "Change Folder (Type Path)…" keeps the typed prompt (absolute,
  relative, or ~-prefixed); either path swaps the PROCESS cwd, so the other view follows
  on its next switch.
- List UX invariants (both views): NOTHING is highlighted until the user selects
  (hover stays subtle); the wheel scrolls the VIEW only (`scroll_view`) and never
  moves the selection; keyboard nav snaps the view to the selection; overflow shows a
  right-edge scrollbar (`ui::draw_scrollbar`). Implementation note: ratatui's stateful
  List AUTO-SCROLLS to keep its selection visible, which fights wheel-scrolling — both
  views therefore window their rows manually (selected/scroll/snap fields) and render
  a plain List of the visible slice.
- Gotcha: after the ✧ suggestion lands, panel focus moves to the message box — letter keys
  then type text instead of triggering actions (Esc returns to the list).
- **Title-bar action buttons** (`ui.rs` `TitleAction`/`title_action_spans`): VS Code-style
  hover buttons at the header's top-right (Explorer: New File / New Folder / Refresh /
  Collapse All; SCM: Refresh / Collapse All), left of the standalone ⚙. Terminals emit NO
  "mouse left the pane" event, so hover is approximated: any mouse event shows them, and
  they fade `TITLE_ACTIONS_LINGER` (3s) after the last one — motion re-shows them before a
  click ever lands, and click zones are only populated while drawn, so a click can never
  trigger an invisible button. Material theme uses the Nerd Font's bundled **codicons**
  (cod-new_file EA7F / cod-new_folder EA80 / cod-refresh EB37 / cod-collapse_all EAC5 —
  VS Code's own icons; verified in the CaskaydiaCove cmap). Chips are a plain ` X ` (one
  space each side, NO activity-bar-style slack cell): the **Mono NF build renders these
  single-cell**, and a trailing slack cell pushes the glyph's right edge to the chip's
  center (user-reported live); the non-Mono build just overflows into the trailing space
  like the tree's file icons do.

### Source Control view specifics (`src/scm_app.rs`)

- **Multi-repo**: `Git::discover_all` lists the repo containing the cwd plus child repos two
  levels down (`.git` dir or file), skipping `target`/`node_modules`/`.claude` (the agent
  worktrees under `.claude/worktrees` would otherwise show up as repos). With >1 repo the
  layout mirrors VS Code's: each repo section carries its OWN inline message box (3-line
  bordered list row) and ✓ Commit button, and the repo header row shows `⎇branch*` (star =
  dirty) plus clickable ⟳ sync / ✓ commit icons in the fixed last-6 columns. List rows now
  have VARIABLE HEIGHT — mouse hit-testing walks `Row::height()`, and j/k skip the widget
  rows (`Row::selectable()`). The ✧ suggest / S sync keys act on the ACTIVE repo — the one
  the selection is in (named in the panel header).
- **Git drawers** (title-case names, incl. Worktrees): drawer lines carry parsed
  refs (`DrawerRef` — commit hash / stash index / branch / remote / tag / worktree path,
  see `parse_drawer_ref`). Click or ⏎ shows the ref
  via colored `git show --stat --patch` in the SAME preview pane (`show/<root>/<spec>[/<path>]`
  control requests; FILE HISTORY narrows to the followed file). Ctrl+right-click opens
  per-type menus (checkout / merge / cherry-pick / revert / reset / stash apply-pop-drop /
  fetch / delete / copy); destructive ones route through the generic `Overlay::ConfirmGit`
  y/N prompt. Hovered file rows show a `+`/`−` glyph (click zone = last 5 columns) and the
  section headers a section-wide one (last 6); a dim "ctrl+rclick for menus" hint sits on
  the « footer line whenever the footer is otherwise empty.
- **Sync Changes** (`S` or the ⇅ button, shown only when ahead/behind ≠ 0): `pull --rebase
  --autostash` then `push`, on a background thread polled from tick(). Ahead/behind parse
  from the porcelain `## branch...upstream [ahead N, behind M]` header.
- Hotkey hints render as keycap chips (`wrap_hints` takes `(key, label)` pairs, shared in
  `ui.rs`). They live in the ⚙ Settings modal; the FOOTER copy is opt-in via the
  "Footer hotkeys" setting (persisted as `hotkeys` in the state file, default hidden —
  it clipped in narrow panes). The ✧ suggest button uses MDI "creation" (`\u{f0674}`,
  the outline ✨ silhouette) in the material theme.
- There is NO collapse-to-sliver mode anymore (herdr's 10% ratio floor made the sliver
  a wide empty strip — user-rejected). « bottom-right / `b` HIDE the sidebar instead:
  per-tab snooze marker + `pane.close` of its own pane (`hide()` in both apps,
  `src/snooze.rs` shared with the ensure hook, `launch::tab_of`). The herdr keybinding
  `prefix+b` (config.toml `[[keys.command]]` → the toggle action, like the other plugin
  binds) brings it back — or hides it again when it's focused.
- **Esc must never exit a sidebar TUI** — a stray Esc used to drop the pane back to the
  shell prompt (user-reported). Esc closes overlays, then closes the tab's preview pane
  (`viewer::close_in_tab`); only `q` quits.

### Diff preview

- Previews/diffs open FULL-SIZE by default — everything beside the sidebar, sidebar
  still visible (user-rejected the zoom approach, which covered it). Mechanism: the
  tab's other panes are PARKED — `pane.move`d into a background "· preview" tab — with
  their rects recorded in a plan file beside the control file; the viewer then splits
  the momentarily-full-width sidebar at its PRE-park width fraction (captured before the
  park — measuring after reads 100%). Esc (either process; both read the plan) moves
  them home by guillotine-recovering the split tree from the recorded rects and
  replaying it pre-order (first pane splits the viewer, each split re-splits the
  first-subtree's top-left pane at the recorded ratio), then `layout.set_split_ratio`
  restores the sidebar's width. Verified: exact rects round-trip. Zoom would NOT work
  here: it covers the whole tab, and same-tab `pane.move` being a no-op is why parking
  bounces through a real background tab. Stale plans (viewer died with panes parked,
  e.g. redeploy) self-heal on the next preview open. **Measure the sidebar's width
  fraction FIRST, before closing a stale viewer**: the close leaves the sidebar
  momentarily alone at full width, and a post-close measurement reads a meaningless
  ~1.0 (clamped to 0.5, that was the half-width-sidebar bug). `owner_frac` treats
  any fraction outside 0.02..0.55 as no-signal (`None` → 0.3 fallback), and after
  the viewer opens `enforce_owner_width` pins the root split to the pre-click
  fraction so the width is deterministic whichever spawn path ran. "Full-size preview" in ⚙ Settings
  (persisted `preview_full`, default on) reverts to the 50/50 beside-mode split.
- Clicking a changed file in Source Control (or `o`, or the context menu's Open Diff)
  shows its colored `git diff` in the SAME preview pane the explorer uses: the control
  file carries typed requests (`file/<path>` / `diff/<root>/<rel>/<kind>`, tab-separated),
  diffs render VS Code-style via the in-crate `diffview.rs` — OUR parse of plain
  `git diff` (dual old/new gutters, full-width red/green row tints padded at draw time,
  darker word-level tint on paired changed lines, syntax-highlighted code through two
  stateful `LineHighlighter`s for old/new contexts). `ansi.rs` (SGR parser) still renders
  `git show` output (ansi-to-tui pins an older ratatui — don't add it), and diffs re-run
  every ~2s so they live-update.
  Staged rows show `--cached`; untracked files render via `diff --no-index NUL <file>`.

### Syntax highlighting (file preview)

- `syntect` with `regex-fancy` (pure Rust — the default oniguruma engine needs a C build
  that's pain on Windows). syntect's BUNDLED grammar set is Sublime's defaults and lacks
  TypeScript, TOML, Dockerfile and friends — `two-face` supplies bat's extended set
  (`two_face::syntax::extra_newlines()`), themes still from syntect's `ThemeSet` (theme
  data is grammar-independent). Foreground colors only: the terminal owns the background.
  See `src/syntax.rs`; unknown extensions fall back to plain lines.

### Verifying a plugin TUI end-to-end

Drive the real binary in a throwaway herdr pane instead of unit-testing rendering:
`pane split --current --direction right --no-focus --cwd <scratch repo>` (--direction is
required), then `pane run <id> "& '<abs path to exe>'"` (PS call operator — a bare path
splits on spaces), then `pane send-keys <id> Down Enter …`, capture with
`pane read <id> --source visible`, and confirm side effects with plain `git` commands in
the scratch repo. Close the pane when done. Cheap, and it catches layout truncation bugs
unit tests can't. Run the TUI with `$env:HERDR_PANE_ID=''` so it skips identity-token
reporting — otherwise the test pane registers as a real sidebar and the tab's launcher/
ensure logic can fight over it.

**Mouse interactions ARE drivable** (verified live): `pane.send_input` text is fed to the
TUI's stdin, and crossterm parses SGR mouse sequences from it like any terminal input.
Send `ESC[<35;X;YM` (motion), `ESC[<0;X;YM` (left press), `ESC[<0;X;Ym` (release) with
1-based coords — put motion AND press/release in ONE send_input text: the event loop
draws between events, so the motion populates hover state/click zones before the click
lands (needed for anything hover-revealed). Two gotchas: `pane read` renders private-use
Nerd Font glyphs as blanks — launch with `HERDR_SIDEBAR_ICONS=emoji` when you need to SEE
icon positions in captures; and Claude Code's tools reject raw ESC bytes in commands, so
build sequences programmatically (`[char]27`, or JSON `\u001b` via a params file — see
`herdr_ipc.py` pattern: open `\\.\pipe\<HERDR_SOCKET_PATH>` from Python; PS 5.1's
FileStream refuses pipe paths).

## README screenshots (how-to)

The framed screenshots in `plugins/herdr-sidebar/docs/media/` are produced with the
scripts in `tools/screenshots/` (capture → crop → frame). Full reshoot procedure, verified
end-to-end twice:

0. **Shared backdrop (shoot session)** — shots are taken in the isolated
   `herdr --session shoot` server so herdr's left chrome shows a DUMMY roster, kept
   IDENTICAL to the herdr-aa-notes repo's shots (mirrored in that repo's CLAUDE.md):
   spaces `acme-app [main ↑1]` / `acme-api [main]` / `acme-web [dev]` /
   `billing-service [main]`; agents in acme-app's 2×2 grid: `auth-refactor` (claude),
   `checkout-tests` (codex), `api-docs` (codex, unsubmitted composer text),
   `rate-limiter` (claude, unsubmitted composer text); plus FAKE agent rows declared
   via the socket's `pane.report_agent` (persists over herdr's own detection, no CLI
   spawned): `flaky-tests` (codex, working, acme-api), `reviewer` (claude, idle,
   acme-web), `migrations` (codex, working, billing-service). Control the session with
   `HERDR_SOCKET_PATH` = `C:\Users\Alex\AppData\Roaming\herdr\sessions\shoot\herdr.sock`;
   its WT window is titled `herdr-shoot` (launched via `attach_shoot.ps1`, which clears
   inherited HERDR_* env — herdr refuses nested attach). Capture/resize with
   `capture_titled.ps1 'herdr-shoot' <out>` / `resize_titled.ps1` — the un-titled
   variants grab the FIRST WT window and are ambiguous with two open. Link the plugin
   INSIDE the session (`herdr plugin link .` with the socket env set); the ensure hook
   then docks sidebars on tab focus. Keep agent panes ≤63 cols (compact no-email
   banner). Leave the session running for the other repo's reshoots.
1. **Window (re-verified for the v0.5.x reshoot)**: the shoot window uses a dedicated
   WT profile `herdr-shoot` (fontSize 11; added to WT settings.json — backup saved as
   settings.json.herdr-shoot.bak) launched with
   `wt -w new nt -p herdr-shoot --title herdr-shoot` (attach_shoot.ps1 runs inside).
   Size the window until the TAB AREA is **138×48 cells** (1526×1011 px at font 11 —
   verify with `pane layout`, don't trust pixels); crop is
   `crop.ps1 <raw> <out> 8 48 1510 955`. Grid ratios: sidebar 38 cols
   (root ratio 0.2754), agent quadrants 50 cols each (TL/TR split 0.5) — an EQUAL 2×2.
   **Claude's banner includes the user's EMAIL at ≥73 cols** (re-measured v2.1.216;
   the old ≤63/74+ note was stale) — keep agent panes ≤72; 50 is the floor where the
   codex banner still fits unwrapped-ish. Old 1760×996 numbers are obsolete.
2. **Demo repo**: `setup_demo.sh` rebuilds `C:/Users/Alex/Projects/acme-app` (staged
   docs/auth.md, modified routes.rs, dirty `acme-sdk` child repo, 1 commit ahead of a bare
   `.acme-origin.git`) — multi-repo + sync + diff all have something to show.
3. **Stage**: new tab in this workspace with `--cwd` = acme-app, `herdr tab focus` it,
   invoke `herdr-sidebar.open-sidebar-windows`, close the tab's shell pane.
4. **Shots** (drive via `pane send-keys`, capture via `tools/screenshots/shot.py
   <sidebar_pane_id[,pane2]> <name>` — it pumps SGR mouse motion into the listed panes
   during capture so the hover title-bar buttons stay visible (their 3s linger is
   shorter than the capture powershell's startup), captures via **capture_exact.ps1**
   and crops; `--no-motion` for modal shots. ALWAYS `tab focus` the target tab first —
   staging the other tab leaves focus there and you capture the wrong tab):
   *preview* — explorer view, expand src/api (`Down Down Enter`, `Down Enter`), select
   routes.rs, Enter opens the preview pane. *scm* — `2`, Down×4 to routes.rs, `o` opens
   the diff. *separated* — `s`, Enter toggles unified off (capture, then toggle back).
   *hero* — explorer view, Esc closes the preview, split a 2×2 agent grid to the right
   (0.25 sidebar split, then 0.5, then two down-splits), `claude` + `codex --model gpt-5.5`
   workers with prompts, fresh `claude` and `codex` for the spawn banners. *settings* —
   `s` over the hero layout.
5. **Frame**: `python tools/screenshots/frame_all.py <dir with crop-*.png>` writes the
   framed set straight into docs/media (gradient backdrop + macOS-style titlebar).
6. **Teardown**: close the tab, PEB-scan-kill any process whose cwd is under acme-app
   (see the feature-worktree skill for the snippet), delete acme-app + .acme-origin.git,
   restore the window size.

Hard-won capture gotchas:

- `capture.ps1`/`capture_titled.ps1` are **screen-space** copies: whatever overlays that
  region wins the pixels (a fullscreen game ate a whole round of captures), and
  capture_titled's SUBSTRING title match once grabbed the USER'S OWN terminal — Claude
  Code's auto-set terminal title happened to contain "herdr-shoot". Use
  **capture_exact.ps1** (exact title + PrintWindow PW_RENDERFULLCONTENT): immune to
  occlusion, monitors, and title collisions. Still **view every capture** before shipping.
- **NO_COLOR kills Claude Code's orange** (the CLAUDE.md crossterm gotcha, shoot-server
  edition): agent tool shells carry NO_COLOR=1 (even when a nested probe shell says
  otherwise — check `$env:NO_COLOR` in the ACTUAL shell), every server started from one
  passes it to every pane, and claude renders monochrome. Start the shoot server with
  the var explicitly removed and verify a pane echoes `NO_COLOR=[]` before staging.
  `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_NONESSENTIAL_TRAFFIC=1` on claude spawns also suppresses the
  release-promo box that otherwise pushes the welcome banner out of short panes.
- Claude re-renders its banner on RESIZE: a narrow-launch trick does not survive a
  later widen — the email comes back. The pane width at capture time is what counts.
- The sidebar's `state.json` is **GLOBAL** (%LOCALAPPDATA%\herdr\plugins\herdr-sidebar
  — shared with the user's real session!). The separated shot toggles unified off and
  needs `preview_full:false` (edit the file directly; the settings-modal Down-count is
  view-dependent) — RESTORE merged:true + preview_full:true when done.
- Separated shot composition: after toggling, pin Source Control to 38 cols
  (root ratio 0.275), open the routes.rs diff (beside mode), then `pane swap` the
  viewer to the far right so it reads SC | Explorer | diff.
- The spaces list order = workspace CREATION order; recreating a workspace mid-shoot
  sends it to the bottom — recreate ALL of them in roster order.
- Fake agent rows (pane.report_agent) do NOT survive a server restart — re-report them.
- codex shows an update notice on spawn; `npm install -g @openai/codex` then
  `cls; codex` relaunch gives a clean banner (update prompts eat the next keystroke
  as composer text when the skip choice was already saved).
- The visible tab is whatever the WT window shows — `herdr tab focus <staging tab>` first,
  and re-check before each capture; pane closes/spawns can bounce focus to another tab.
- Claude's welcome banner is width-dependent: ≲60 cols renders the compact box (no email),
  wider panes render the two-column banner **including the user's email** — keep agent
  panes narrow (even 2×2 columns) or blur with `blur_region.py <img> <x> <y> <w> <h>`.
- Codex: `pane run` delivers the prompt via bracketed paste — send a separate
  `pane send-keys <pane> Enter` to submit. Capture fresh codex panes quickly; an
  intermittent MCP 401 warning can appear ~8s after spawn.
- WT resize calls block while WT's UI thread is busy (modal loops, drags, hangs) — use a
  timeout, and fall back to `resize_wt_async.ps1` (`SetWindowPos` with SWP_ASYNCWINDOWPOS)
  if MoveWindow wedges.

## SCM playground repo

`C:/Users/Alex/Projects/scm-playground` is a PERSISTENT sandbox for exercising the Source
Control view without touching real repos: branches, a second worktree
(`scm-playground-search`), two stashes, two tags, a local bare `origin`
(`.scm-playground-origin.git`, main 1 ahead) plus a `github` remote URL, and a
staged/modified/untracked spread. Rebuild it any time with `tools/setup-playground.sh`
(destructive: wipes and recreates all three directories).

## macOS (verified live against herdr 0.7.4 on macOS 26)

First clean install of both plugins on a Mac (driven over SSH), findings:

- Install: `curl -fsSL https://herdr.dev/install.sh | sh` (lands in `~/.local/bin`), then
  `herdr plugin install <owner>/<repo>[/subdir] --yes` — the `--yes` must come AFTER the
  target (before it, the arg parser rejects the whole command), and it is REQUIRED when
  stdin is not a TTY ("remote plugin install requires --yes when stdin is not interactive").
- Plugin state dir on unix resolves to `XDG_STATE_HOME` else
  `~/.local/state/herdr/plugins/<plugin-id>/` (our `state.rs` fallback; herdr injects
  `HERDR_PLUGIN_STATE_DIR` for hooks/actions only, same as Windows).
- **Headless/SSH herdr**: `herdr` needs a TTY. A pipeline-attached `ssh -tt` client gets a
  degenerate window (panes ~2 rows) and every `pane split` fails with
  `pane_split_failed: ghostty error -2` — the split result is smaller than a pane minimum.
  Fix: run the client under a fake sized TTY:
  `nohup script -q /dev/null /bin/zsh -c 'stty rows 54 cols 220; exec herdr' &`.
  The server survives client death, restoring the session on next attach — but
  `pkill -f 'herdr$'` matches the SERVER too; workspace ids change across that restart.
- **Unix launcher vs ensure-hook race**: `open-sidebar.sh` / `open-git.sh` originally took
  no lock, so a user toggle racing a focus-burst ensure docked TWO sidebars (seen live).
  They now take the SAME `herdr-sidebar-ensure.lock` mkdir lock as the hook — waiting
  (20×0.5s) instead of yielding so the toggle isn't dropped. Post-lock terminal commands
  must NOT `exec`: exec skips the EXIT trap and leaks the lock until the 30s stale-break.
- The `merged` (unified sidebar) default was still `false` from the experiment era — fresh
  installs came up as a pinned separate Explorer. Flipped to `true` (existing users keep
  their persisted value).
- Everything else verified working on macOS unchanged: ensure hook docks on tab focus,
  unified view switch, SCM drawers/commit box in a real repo, full-size diff preview with
  park/restore round-trip, first-run Nerd Font prompt (curl+unzip path), heartbeat tokens,
  herdr-notes toggle.

## Herdr workspace

`herdr-layout.yaml` at the repo root describes the workspace (Coordinator tab running claude,
shell tab, git tab with lazygit). The Coordinator session delegates feature work to sibling
panes — see `.claude/skills/feature-worktree/` (one feature = one git worktree = one pane).
