# CLAUDE.md

Notes for Claude Code (and any other AI coding assistant) working on this
repo. Human contributors should read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) and
[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) first — this file assumes you've
skimmed both.

Every rule below is a non-negotiable constraint. Read the section that
matches your change before you write code.

---

## ⚠️ This file is PUBLIC — read before editing it

`CLAUDE.md` is tracked in git and ships in the public AGPL repository.
Anything you add here is published to everyone, permanently, and cannot be
recalled by a later delete — it stays in history.

It is deliberately tracked (see `.gitignore`) so that contributors working
in a fresh clone get the same design invariants the maintainers use. That
only works if it stays free of anything install-specific.

**Never add to this file:**

- Absolute filesystem paths (`/mnt/...`, `/home/...`, `C:\...`). Use
  repo-relative paths.
- Hostnames, IP addresses, ports, or fleet/server topology.
- Credentials, tokens, keys, or anything resembling one.
- Links to paths that are gitignored — `.claude/`, `.claude_code/`,
  `internal_tools/`, `docs/`. A link a public clone cannot follow is worse
  than no link, and describing tooling that does not ship misleads
  contributors into trying to use it.
- Customer, merchant, or employee names; support tickets; revenue figures.
- Anything you would not put in a public README.

**Before you edit it, ask:** is this rule true for anyone who clones this
repo, or only true on this machine? Only the first kind belongs here.
Machine-specific notes belong in your own ignored config.

`make check-claude-md` (also run by pre-commit and CI) enforces the
mechanical half of this. It cannot judge the rest — that is on you.

## What Spwig is

Self-hosted e-commerce platform. Django 5, PostgreSQL, Redis, Docker.
AGPL-3.0-or-later. Every solution should be built with ease of use,
modern aesthetics, and speed, with the merchant and their customers at
the centre of focus.

**Branding rule.** Spwig merchants and their customers don't know about
Django. When you write documentation, error messages, admin copy, or any
merchant/customer-facing text, use "Spwig" instead of naming the
underlying framework.

## Terminology

- **Merchant** — the store owner/admin who runs a Spwig install.
- **Community / Pro / Enterprise** — runtime editions gated by a signed
  licence file. Community is the default when the platform
  auto-bootstraps a licence.
- **Provider** — a pluggable component that integrates an external
  system (payments, shipping, exchange rates, translation, GeoIP, SMS,
  email). Lives in [Spwig/components](https://github.com/Spwig/components).
- **Marketplace / update server** — `updates.spwig.com`; where
  components are published and where anonymous telemetry pings go.
  Client code lives in `component_updates/`.

---

## Architecture: single-tenant by design

Each Spwig installation is **one store, one merchant, one Django Site**.

- `SITE_ID = 1` is hard-coded. There is no multi-site UI.
- Django's Sites framework exists because `django-allauth` needs it —
  not because we use it for multi-tenancy.
- The Sites admin is unregistered in `core/admin.py` so merchants
  can't create additional sites.
- All code assumes `Site.objects.get(pk=1)`.
- Multi-store merchants run one Spwig install per store.
- **Do NOT implement multi-site / multi-tenant features.**

Models with Site foreign keys (`EmailAccount`, `EmailTemplate`,
`EmailOutbox`, `ExchangeRateProviderAccount`) always use Site ID=1.

More background: [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).

---

## Editions & licence bootstrap

- `core.apps:CoreConfig.ready()` bootstraps a signed **Community**
  licence at `settings.LICENSE_PATH` on first boot. Template lives at
  `core/data/community_licence.json`.
- `ActivationMiddleware` becomes a no-op once any valid licence file
  exists — Community installs never see an `/activate/` redirect loop.
- Feature-gating is **runtime**, not build-time.
  `LicenseManager.is_community()` /
  `is_hosted_service_available('geoip')` are the gates.
  Don't strip Pro-only code from the OSS build — keep it and gate.
- **POS module.** `pos_app/` and `pos_api/` ship in every edition
  including Community. `pos_app/license.py` returns True for every
  install as a no-op shim — Spwig no longer monetises POS as a
  feature. Revenue comes from hosting, hosted-service tier limits,
  the mail gateway, and support.

### When something is Pro-only

Two gating patterns:

1. **`LicenseManager.is_community()`** — early-returns a "requires paid
   tier" response.
2. **`is_hosted_service_available('service_name')`** — Community can
   use `geoip` / `geocoder` / `push` (rate-limited by the hosted
   service); only `mail_gateway` is Pro-only.

Prefer #2 when adding features that consume Spwig-hosted infrastructure.

## URL structure and routing

Decide before touching URLs: does the endpoint belong **inside**
`i18n_patterns` (localised URLs, `/en/...`) or **outside** (APIs and
webhooks, no language prefix)?

### Hierarchy

- **Non-i18n group** (no language prefix) lives outside `i18n_patterns`
  in `core/urls.py`. Use for APIs (`/api/...`), webhooks
  (`/webhooks/...`), health endpoints, `/i18n/`, and dev static/media
  helpers.
- **i18n group** (language prefix) lives inside `i18n_patterns`. Use for
  Django admin (`/en/admin/` etc.), admin sub-apps, all localised user
  pages.

```python
# non-i18n
path("api/set-currency/", set_currency, name="set_currency")

# i18n
urlpatterns += i18n_patterns(
    path("admin/loyalty/", include("loyalty.urls")),
    path("admin/", admin.site.urls),
)
```

### Conventions

- Admin apps live under `/admin/...` (e.g. `/en/admin/shipping/providers/`).
- APIs live under `/api/...` with no language prefix (e.g. `/api/cart/add/`).
- Use `include()` at a common prefix so the app-level `urls.py` inherits
  the prefix.

### JavaScript URL building

- Admin URLs: derive the language from
  `document.documentElement.lang` (as in the example below), or call
  `AdminUtils.buildAdminUrl(path)`. `buildAdminUrl` attaches the prefix
  for **Django admin core** URLs only — app URLs under `/admin/<app>/`
  still need the manual `/${lang}/` prefix unless explicitly supported.
- API URLs: call directly with no `/lang/` prefix.

```javascript
const lang = document.documentElement.lang || 'en';
const adminUrl = `/${lang}/admin/loyalty/members/filter/`;
const apiUrl = '/api/set-currency/';
```

### Anti-patterns

- `/loyalty/...` without `/admin/` → 404.
- `/en/api/...` → 404. APIs never carry a language prefix.

### Conventions outside core routing

- Always use named URLs in templates and tests
  (`{% url 'product:detail' product.slug %}`), with language/country
  prefixes where required.
- Follow RESTful naming for storefront flows (`/products/`, `/cart/`,
  `/checkout/`).
- Apply the right permission checks (admin vs. customer) and lean on
  class-based views/mixins for reusable behaviour.

---

## Translations — three distinct systems

Do not conflate them.

### 1. Admin interface i18n (`{% trans %}` / `gettext`)

- Standard Django i18n; strings extracted with `makemessages` into
  `.po` files.
- Admin-facing strings only (sidebar, admin forms, admin buttons).
- **Do NOT manually translate `.po` files.** Extract only; translation
  is handled by the platform translation system.
- Supported admin languages: `en`, `es`, `fr`, `de`, `ja`, `pt`,
  `zh-hans`, `zh-hant`, `ru`, `ar`, `hi`, `id`, `ko`, `tr`, `vi`,
  `it`, `th`.
- Wrap user-facing strings: `{% trans %}`, `{% blocktrans %}`, `_()`.
  Add context when ambiguous: `{% trans "Order" context "noun" %}`.
- Translation keys must be descriptive — no `btn_1`.

### 2. Merchant content translation (JSONField)

AI translations for **merchant-authored content** (products, pages,
SEO). Runs on the merchant's host.

- Data lives in a `translations = models.JSONField(default=dict, blank=True)`
  on the model. Never use a different storage pattern.
- Payload shape:
  ```json
  {
    "es": {
      "title": "Mi título",
      "description": "Descripción",
      "_meta": {"auto": true, "verified": false, "translated_at": "..."}
    }
  }
  ```
- Wire the admin with `TranslatableFieldWidget` in the form and
  `TranslatableAdminMixin` in the ModelAdmin. Declare
  `translatable_fields`. Load `Media.js` / `Media.css`.
- In custom change-form templates, include
  `translation_editor_assets.html` in `extrahead` and
  `translation_editor_init.html` inside `field_sets`.
- API lives at `/api/translation/...` (`status/`, `translate/`, `save/`,
  `languages/`, `health/`). `model_type` is `app_label.model_name`.
- Multi-sentence text is auto-split, batch-translated, reconstructed —
  no manual work.
- Reference implementations: `catalog.Product`, `page_builder`,
  `core.SiteSettings`.
- **Don't**: use `modeltranslation`, create `name_en` columns,
  hardcode language lists, ship a custom UI, or mix admin i18n with
  this system.
- **Retrofit steps:** add the JSONField via migration → wire the
  mixin/widgets → patch any custom change-form template → test against
  real multi-sentence data.
- **Troubleshooting:** no 🌐 button → check `translatable_fields`,
  widgets, and `Media` are declared and the object exists. Translation
  failing → hit `/api/translation/health/` and
  `/api/translation/languages/`, check the console, confirm the
  JSONField.

### 3. Storefront UI chrome (`{% mtrans %}`)

Merchant overrides for **static storefront UI strings** (cart,
checkout, product buttons, headers). Distinct from admin i18n and from
merchant content translation.

**When to use which:**
- Customer sees it → `{% mtrans %}` (with `{% trans %}` fallback).
- Only the admin sees it → `{% trans %}`.

**Adding a new storefront string:**

1. Register in `translations/ui_string_registry.py` under the right
   section (`common`, `cart`, `checkout`, `product`, `account`,
   `search`, `js`, etc.). Keys are `section.snake_case`
   (`cart.shopping_cart`, `product.add_to_cart`).
2. Use in template:
   ```django
   {% load i18n static merchant_trans %}
   <button>{% mtrans 'Add to Cart' %}</button>
   ```
   The tag argument must **exactly match** the registered English value.
3. JavaScript strings register under `js.*` and are accessed as
   `window.UI_STRINGS['js.product_added']`.
4. Run `./manage.py sync_ui_string_registry` after adding keys.

**Anti-patterns:**
- `{% mtrans %}` in admin templates.
- Adding storefront strings without registering them.
- Dynamic/variable arguments to `{% mtrans %}` — literals only.
- Forgetting `{% load merchant_trans %}`.
- Wrapping `{% blocktrans %}` with `{% mtrans %}` — mtrans has no block
  mode; leave `blocktrans` as-is when migrating a template.

---

## Static files & CSS discipline

### Static files

- Always `{% load static %}` and reference assets via `{% static '...' %}`.
- Organise as `app/static/app/{css,js,images}/`.
- Never hardcode `/static/...` paths.
- Compress/minify assets for production.
- **Never edit anything under `staticfiles/`** — that directory is
  populated by `collectstatic` from the app-level source directories.
  Edit the source, then run
  `./manage.py collectstatic --noinput`.

### Copyright headers

Every new CSS and JS source file should begin with this as the very
first line, followed by a blank line:

```
/* Copyright (c) 2025-2026 Spwig contributors. Licensed under AGPL-3.0. */
```

Do NOT add this header to:
- Third-party / vendor files (`*.min.js`, `*.min.css`, anything under
  `core/static/core/js/vendor/`).
- Files under `staticfiles/` (edit the source).
- Files under `components/themes/*/tokens.css` — generated by
  `design.services.token_css_generator`; the generator applies the
  header automatically.

### Admin theme files

- Edit `core/static/core/admin/css/themes/{light.css,dark.css}` in
  development, then `collectstatic`.
- Update both light and dark variants when a shared style changes.
- Theme files store variables; concrete CSS classes belong in
  app-scoped styles.

### CSS best practices

- **CSP-safe.** No inline `<style>` tags. No inline `style=""`
  attributes. Everything in external CSS via `<link rel="stylesheet">`.
  Dynamic values ride on `data-*` attributes + CSS custom properties.
  See [CSP hardening](#security--csp-hardening) below.
- **Mobile first.** ~80% of storefront traffic is mobile. Write
  responsive CSS with a mobile-first mindset — this applies to both
  storefront and admin.
- Scope app CSS: `.product-form-container .form-row { ... }` — never
  ship unscoped selectors from an app.

### Admin form styling — three tiers

**Reuse before you write — this is the one that matters most for admin
work.** Build admin UI from the classes and utilities already in
`admin-base.css`; **do not create new admin CSS unless nothing existing
fits.** New (scoped) app CSS is a last resort for genuinely bespoke,
page-specific needs — reach for it only after searching `admin-base.css`
for a class that already does the job. The point is **admin-wide visual
consistency** and keeping the **number of CSS files to maintain as small
as possible**. A new admin CSS file should be rare and justified.

1. **Django defaults** (`staticfiles/admin/css/forms.css`) — never
   modify.
2. **Global admin overrides** (`core/static/core/admin/css/admin-base.css`)
   — single source for shared spacing, inputs, labels, `.required`,
   `.help`.
3. **App overrides** (`app/static/app/css/*.css`) — must be scoped
   (e.g. `.product-form-container .form-row {...}`).

**Cascade:** `forms.css` → `admin-base.css` → scoped app CSS.

**Decision:** an existing `admin-base.css` class fits → reuse it (do
nothing); a shared style that's genuinely missing → add it to tier 2;
only truly page-specific styling with no existing class → tier 3.
Don't duplicate tier 2 rules in app CSS.

**Maintenance:** audit `admin-base.css` before adding an override, scope
every tier-3 selector, test across key pages, and respect specificity
order (theme → app → components). Collapsible admin sections must adopt
the `admin-base.css` fieldset utilities rather than rolling their own.

### Vendor scripts

- Third-party JS libs go in `core/static/core/js/vendor/`.
- Never load from CDNs — serve locally for CSP compliance.

### Storefront overlays must never live inside `<header>`

Any element meant to cover the viewport — modal, drawer, backdrop,
full-screen search — must be a **sibling** of `<header class="site-header">`,
never a descendant. Two independent traps otherwise apply:

1. `.site-header` is `position: sticky` with a `z-index`, so it forms a
   **stacking context**. A child's `z-index: 1050` is capped at the header's
   own layer, and body-level elements (cookie banner at 9999, storefront
   modal at 1050) paint over it regardless.
2. Any `transform`, `filter`, `backdrop-filter`, `will-change`, `contain`, or
   `perspective` on the header or one of its zones makes it the **containing
   block** for `position: fixed` descendants, collapsing a full-screen overlay
   into the header strip. Verified in both Blink and WebKit: a 390×664
   backdrop became 390×76. The dormant `[data-glass-effect]` rule in
   `header-preset-zones.css` would do exactly this if wired up.

Do **not** put `overflow-x` on `.site-header` either — `overflow-x: hidden`
computes `overflow-y` to `auto`, making the header a scroll container that
clips every dropdown hanging below it (account menu, search autocomplete, nav
dropdowns). Contain overflow on `.header-zone__inner` instead.

**How to comply:**

- Static markup (mobile menu, announcement modal) → render after `</header>`
  in `design/templates/design/components/header.html`. The mini-cart already
  does this from `page_builder/base.html`.
- Widget-rendered overlays that can't be moved in the template → portal them
  at runtime with `window.SpwigPortal.mount(nodes, hostClass, {lockScroll})`
  from `design/static/design/js/overlay-portal.js`, and `unmount()` on close.
  Pass a **hardcoded** host class (not `widget.className`, which carries
  merchant-controlled `css_classes`) so descendant CSS keeps matching.
- Locking scroll → use `SpwigPortal.lockScroll()` / `unlockScroll()`.
  `document.body.style.overflow = 'hidden'` does **not** hold on iOS Safari.
- Full-height overlays → pair `100vh` with a `100dvh` line; bare `100vh` sits
  under the iOS browser chrome.

Regression coverage lives in `tests/e2e/test_header_overlays.py` and runs
against **both** Chromium and WebKit — WebKit is the only local proxy for iOS
Safari, and all iOS browsers (including Edge and Chrome) are WKWebView, so an
iOS-only bug is an engine-level bug.

---

## Admin theme integration for app templates

- Read the `admin_theme` context variable (from
  `core.context_processors.admin_theme`) and attach to
  `<body data-theme="{{ admin_theme|default:'light' }}">`.
- In JS: `const currentTheme = '{{ admin_theme|default:"light" }}';`.
- Never build client-side theme state (no cookies / localStorage). Only
  react to `admin-theme-changed` events emitted by the core.
- Isolate canvases/previews (Page Builder etc.) so they don't inherit
  admin theme colours.

---

## Admin sidebar policy

- Sidebar lives exclusively in `templates/admin/base_site.html`. Extend
  Django admin templates so they inherit.
- Any navigation change happens there.
- Structure menu groups logically; use Font Awesome icons; build URLs
  with `{% url %}` and honour language prefixes (`/en/...`).
- Follow the existing collapsible pattern — icons + labels are
  mandatory for consistency.

## Admin page titles

Set `<title>` to `[Page purpose] | [default site URL from Site Settings] | Spwig`.
Example: `Members | example.com | Spwig`.

```django
{% block title %}
  {% trans "Members" %} | {{ site_title|default:_('Site Admin') }} | Spwig
{% endblock %}
```

## Site Settings admin

- Admin class: `SiteSettingsAdmin` in `core/admin.py`.
- Template: `core/templates/admin/core/sitesettings/change_form.html`
  (tabs: General, Contact, Currency & Locale, Images, E-Commerce,
  Shipping, Payments, Authentication, SEO, Advanced).
- Styles: `core/static/core/admin/css/site_settings.css`
  (uses `.two-column-layout` + responsive breakpoints).
- After CSS tweaks: run `./manage.py collectstatic --noinput`.

---

## List views and change lists

### List row cards

Card-based layout (`admin-base.css` supplies the styles) when tables
are limiting or when metadata/badges improve scanning. Skip cards for
simple 2–3 column tables.

- Structure: checkbox, icon/avatar, content (title/subtitle/meta/badges/stats),
  action buttons.
- Badge variants: default, `.primary`, `.success`, `.warning`, `.error`.
  Both modifier-class (`.list-row-card-badge.success`) and BEM-dash
  (`.list-row-card-badge-success`) syntaxes are supported.
- Card states: `.selected`, `.disabled`.
- Icon-only actions: use `admin-base.css` utility classes.
- Responsive: horizontal on desktop, stacked <768px, ellipsis for long
  text.

### Filters panel

Always place filters above the list. Use AJAX (no page reload). Good
when there are ≥ 2 filterable fields.

**ALWAYS use `admin-list-filters.js`.** Do not write bespoke filter JS.

Three components — all three must be present:

1. Load in `{% block extrahead %}`:
   ```django
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="{% static 'app/css/custom.css' %}">
   <script src="{% static 'core/admin/js/admin-list-filters.js' %}" defer></script>
   ```
2. Buttons use `data-action` attributes, **never** `onclick`:
   ```html
   <button data-action="toggle-filters">…</button>
   <button data-action="apply-filters">Apply</button>
   <button data-action="clear-filters">Clear</button>
   ```
3. Initialise inside `{% block content %}`:
   ```javascript
   const lang = document.documentElement.lang || 'en';
   window.AdminListFilters.init({
     url: `/${lang}/admin/app/model/filter/`,
     resultsContainer: 'item-results',
     resultsCount: 'item-count'
   });
   ```

**Anti-patterns:**
- `onclick` / `onchange` inline handlers — use `data-action`.
- Bespoke `toggleFilters()` / `applyFilters()` — the module already
  handles it.
- `{% block extrajs %}` — doesn't exist in Django admin; scripts are
  silently discarded.

Django view pattern:
- Verify `X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest`.
- Parse query params, filter queryset, render a partial with
  `render_to_string`.
- Return `JsonResponse({'html': ..., 'count': ...})`.

### Custom changelist pages

- Extend `admin/change_list.html`, `{% load i18n static admin_list %}`,
  override `{% block content %}`.
- Render dashboards / stats / cards **before** `{{ block.super }}` so
  filters/search/pagination still work.
- Provide extra context via `changelist_view` and `extra_context`.

### Action bars in card views

- **Do not override** `{% block object-tools %}`. Use
  `.change-list-header` and `.change-list-header-actions` (from
  `admin-base.css`) for a flex-based action bar with a heading and an
  Add button gated on `has_add_permission`.
- **No inline styles** — CSS classes in external files, using CSS
  variables for theme safety.

---

## Change forms with dashboard cards

- Extend `admin/change_form.html`, load `i18n static`, add dashboard
  CSS via **external file** in `extrastyle`, render cards above
  `{{ block.super }}` inside `{% if original %}`.
- Grid: `.dashboard-stats-grid` (`admin-base.css`) or custom grid with
  `grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr))`.
- Show cards **only when editing an existing object**. Keep inline
  forms collapsed, not removed.
- Cards summarise + surface quick actions. Reuse Font Awesome icons.
- **No inline `<style>` tags.** All CSS goes in external files
  (CSP). Use `{% block extrastyle %}` in change forms (not
  `extrahead`).

```django
{% extends "admin/change_form.html" %}
{% load i18n static %}

{% block extrastyle %}
{{ block.super }}
<link rel="stylesheet" href="{% static 'app/css/model_change_form.css' %}">
{% endblock %}

{% block content %}
{% if original %}
<div class="dashboard-stats-grid">
  <div class="dashboard-stat-card">
    <div class="icon"><i class="fas fa-coins"></i></div>
    <div class="value">{{ original.balance.available_points|floatformat:0 }}</div>
    <div class="label">{% trans "Available Points" %}</div>
  </div>
</div>
{% endif %}
{{ block.super }}
{% endblock %}
```

---

## Icons and tabs

- Prefer Font Awesome for UI. Use emojis only for
  merchant-generated content or rare celebratory cues.
- Tabs use the shared `.admin-tabs` / `.admin-tab-btn` components in
  `admin-base.css`. Switching is handled by `window.AdminTabs`
  (`admin-tabs.js`) — do not write bespoke tab JS.
- Preferred panel pattern: `.admin-tab-content` with `id="tab-{name}"`.
  `AdminTabs` also auto-detects three legacy patterns (`data-panel="*"`,
  `.admin-tab-content[data-tab="*"]`, `id="panel-*"`) — use the preferred
  one for new pages.

`AdminTabs` API:

- `AdminTabs.init({storageKey, onTabChange, persistHash})` — manual
  init.
- `AdminTabs.switchTo(tabName)` — programmatic switch.
- `AdminTabs.getActiveTab()` — current tab.
- `AdminTabs.addErrorBadge(tabName, count)` /
  `AdminTabs.clearErrorBadges()` / `AdminTabs.scanForErrors()`.

---

## JavaScript inside admin — `AdminUtils`

Auto-loaded globally as `window.AdminUtils`, file at
`core/static/core/admin/js/admin-utils.js`.

- Never hardcode language prefixes or maintain regex language lists.
- Never re-implement CSRF cookie lookup.

Helpers:

- `AdminUtils.getLanguagePrefix()` → `/en`, `/fr`, …
- `AdminUtils.buildAdminUrl(path)` — attaches the prefix for Django
  admin **core** URLs. App URLs under `/admin/<app>/` still need a
  manual `/${lang}/` prefix unless explicitly supported.
- `AdminUtils.getCsrfToken()` — canonical CSRF lookup.
- `AdminUtils.buildFetchOptions(method, data, headers)` — standardised
  fetch config (JSON body + headers).

---

## Model standards

Every model needs:

- Translated `verbose_name` / `verbose_name_plural`.
- A meaningful `__str__`.
- `created_at` and `updated_at` fields.
- Relevant indexes on the fields your heavy queries hit.
- **Django Money fields** for every monetary value. The platform
  supports optional multi-currency — every currency value must use the
  shared money handling.

If a model supports admin deletions and fits the recycle-bin workflow,
integrate so deletions go through recycle bin, not hard deletes.

---

## Building capabilities so they stay discoverable
Spwig's product capabilities are derived automatically from the code by the Spwig refinery's capability scanner, it reads service methods, tests, permissions, and routes to reconstruct what the platform can do. Do not hand-write or hand-edit a capabilities file, the format isn't finalized and the scanner regenerates it. Your job is to leave evidence in the code so that derivation is accurate. When you add or change a behaviour:

### Put the behaviour in a named service function/method
 not inline in a view, serializer, or signal. The function name is the capability's anchor; prefer verb-object names (reserve_stock, issue_mandate, transfer_stock). One clear behavioural seam per capability.
### Add at least one behaviour-named test 
 test_stock_is_reserved_on_add_to_cart, test_transfer_creates_stock_movement. Behaviour-named tests are the single strongest capability signal; happy-path-only or missing tests make a capability read as half-baked (and it usually is). If the action is gated, prefer a real permission codename (transfer_stock) over relying only on vanilla view/add/change/delete. Role-membership gating is acceptable where that's the pattern — just know it's a weaker anchor.
### Never let an enum/constant/status name a behaviour you haven't built
A movement_type = "transfer" with no service or test that performs a transfer reads as a shipped capability that's actually vapour. If it's planned-not-built, say so — a # not yet implemented note or a skipped test named for it — so it's honestly discoverable as planned rather than falsely counted as shipped.
### Give the behaviour a one-line, implementation-neutral docstring 
what it does, not how it's marketed ("Move stock between locations, preserving an auditable movement history").

## Security & CSP hardening

- **Enforce CSRF everywhere.**
- Validate every user input rigorously — especially cart, checkout,
  payment operations.
- Respect Django permissions for all admin functionality.
- Sanitise product descriptions and every user-generated content
  surface.

### CSP: no inline JS / CSS

Content Security Policy blocks inline scripts and styles to prevent
XSS. This is critical for an e-commerce platform handling payments.

**JavaScript:**
- No inline `<script>` tags.
- No `onclick` / `onload` / other inline event handlers.
- Everything in external `.js` files loaded via `<script src="...">`.
- Bind events with `addEventListener` inside the external file.
- Pass data from Django templates to JS via `data-*` attributes.

**CSS:**
- No inline `<style>` tags.
- No `style=""` attributes.
- Everything in external `.css` files loaded via
  `<link rel="stylesheet">`.
- Apply styles via classes; use `data-*` + CSS custom properties for
  dynamic values.

The one grey area: templates that carry a data-driven value
(e.g. progress-bar width) may keep a minimal inline `style` on that
attribute only. Static styles go external.

---

## API standards

### Documentation stack

- Interactive docs (dev only): `/internal/api/docs/`.
- Production sets `ENABLE_API_DOCS=False`.
- `/internal/api/*` requires authentication.
- `drf-spectacular` lives in `requirements-dev.txt`.

### Building or changing an API

1. Review existing endpoints first.
2. Follow DRF standards: ViewSets for CRUD, RESTful naming, proper
   auth (Token / Session), permission classes, `django-filter`,
   20/page pagination, `Accept-Language` where relevant.
3. Document with `drf-spectacular`:
   - ViewSets → `@extend_schema_view(...)` covering
     list/retrieve/create/update/partial_update/destroy plus every
     custom action.
   - Function views → `@extend_schema(...)` and `@api_view`.
   - Tags must match the approved list exactly (see the tag registry
     in the docs code).
   - Import every utility you use from `drf_spectacular.utils`
     (`extend_schema`, `extend_schema_view`, `OpenApiResponse`,
     `OpenApiParameter`) — missing imports raise runtime errors.
4. Describe endpoints thoroughly:
   - `summary` (≤ 60 chars) + `description` (purpose, security, use
     cases, warnings).
   - Request + response schemas with examples.
   - Every response status (200, 201, 400, 401, 403, 404, 429, 500).
   - `OpenApiParameter` for query/path params.
5. URL organisation:
   - APIs stay outside `i18n_patterns`.
   - Split app routing: `app/api_urls.py` (under
     `path('api/app/', include(...))`) vs `app/urls.py` (inside
     `i18n_patterns`).
6. Regenerate docs after changes:
   ```bash
   ./manage.py generate_internal_api_docs
   ./manage.py spectacular --file api-schema.yml
   ./manage.py spectacular --format openapi-json --file api-schema.json
   ```

   `api-schema.yml` at the repo root is the **versioned API contract** — the
   SDK type generator reads it, and the `schema-freshness` CI job fails the
   build if it drifts from the code. Regenerate and commit BOTH files with any
   endpoint change. Never write schema files under `docs/` — that directory
   is gitignored, so anything there is invisible to version control and will
   silently go stale.

**Before finishing:** docstrings in code; URL patterns follow the
conventions above; auth / permissions / filtering / pagination in place;
every endpoint appears under the right tag; request/response examples and
all error statuses documented.

### Admin API (mobile app) — `/api/admin/`

Used by the Spwig Merchant mobile app.

**URL structure**
- Everything at `/api/admin/` outside `i18n_patterns`.
- No language prefix.
- Namespace: `admin_api`.

**Authentication**
- Refresh-token auth (not DRF's simple Token).
- Access tokens: 30 min. Refresh tokens: 14 days, rotated on use.
- Stored in `MobileAuthToken`.
- Every endpoint requires `IsStaffUser`.
- Backend: `admin_api.authentication.MobileTokenAuthentication`.

**Audit logging**
- Every state-changing operation must create an audit entry:
  who / what / when / old / new.
- Use `AdminAPIAuditLog` via `AuditService.log()`.
- Never log passwords or full tokens.
- Required for order status, stock adjustments, product status.

**Documentation**
- Tag every endpoint with `Admin`.
- Include rate-limiting info in descriptions.

**Rate limits**
- Login: 5/min (`admin_auth`).
- General admin API: 300/min (`admin_api`).
- Sensitive ops (stock, status): 30/min (`admin_sensitive`).

**Error responses**
- `{success: bool, error: {code, message, reference}}`.
- Never expose stack traces or internal details.
- Unique error references (format `ERR-XXXXXX`) for debugging.
- Standard HTTP status codes.

**Push notifications**
- Device registration: `/api/admin/devices/register/`.
- APNs (iOS) first.
- Types: `new_order`, `low_stock`, `customer_message`.
- Delivery via Celery tasks.
- Store APNs credentials in environment variables — never in code.

**Request headers**
- `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`.
- `X-Device-ID: <device_uuid>` (audit + tracking).
- `X-Device-Name: <device_name>` (optional, for admin display).

## Currency

Always use Django Money fields for monetary values. The platform
supports optional multi-currency; every price/tax/discount/refund/etc.
must flow through the shared money handling.

---

## Versioning distributable components

Spwig is the version author of record. Whenever you add or update a
distributable component (app, utility, widget, theme, provider), bump
its version and follow the versioning/publish process — a code change to
a shipped component is not finished until its version is bumped.

---

## Theme tokens workflow

Themes live in [Spwig/components](https://github.com/Spwig/components),
not in this repo. When you change tokens:

1. Edit `tokens.json` in the target theme.
2. `./manage.py generate_tokens_css --all` — regenerates `tokens.css`.
3. `./manage.py update_theme_css --all` — writes `Theme.compiled_css`
   in the DB.
4. **Never manually edit `tokens.css`** — the generator overwrites it.

Supported token categories: `colors`, `dark`, `typography`, `spacing`,
`borders`, `shadows`, `transitions`, `breakpoints`, `responsive`,
`z-index`, `container`; component tokens (menu, header, footer, search,
button/card variants); element tokens (hero, button, spacer, etc.);
widget tokens.

**Dark mode.** Add a `dark` section to `tokens.json` with `bg-*`,
`surface-*`, `text-*`, `border-*`, `overlay` tokens — the generator
emits both `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` and
`[data-theme="dark"]` overrides.

---

## Celery workers during development

When you change code that Celery workers run, kill and restart the
workers so your changes are picked up. Autoreload only covers the dev
server, not Celery.

---

## Testing

Run the full suite:

```bash
./manage.py test
# or
pytest tests/
```

- New features ship with tests.
- Bug fixes should include a regression test.
- CI runs the whole suite plus lint + security on every PR.

---

## Telemetry

Anonymous daily ping to `updates.spwig.com/api/v1/telemetry/`. Payload:
install UUID, Spwig version, edition, country (from IP; the IP itself
is not stored), bucket counts of active feature flags.

Opt out: `SPWIG_TELEMETRY=0`. See `core/telemetry/` and the
[README privacy section](README.md#privacy--telemetry).

---

## Design rules (visual / CSS / components)

For themes, refer to the design rules doc bundled with each theme in
the components repo. Key rules:

- Prefer design tokens over hardcoded values.
- Support RTL.
- Match the existing dark-mode pattern.
- Inline `style="..."` is for **data-driven values only** (e.g. a
  progress bar's width). Static styling goes in external CSS.

---

## Affiliate payment system invariants

If you touch the affiliate subsystem, preserve these invariants:

- Commission amounts are immutable after creation.
- Timestamps are read-only and auto-generated.
- One commission per order — duplicates forbidden.
- Marking a payout complete updates commissions atomically.
- Everything is reversible with a full audit trail.
- Balances derive from source data:
  - `total_earned == outstanding_balance + total_paid`
  - `outstanding_balance >= 0`
  - `payout.amount == sum(commission.amount)`

Consult the affiliate app's own docs before making changes.

---

## Required follow-up work

Some changes are not finished when the code compiles. The checklists below
say which changes oblige which follow-up. They apply to every contributor —
do the work yourself, or delegate it to whatever tooling you use.

If you are an AI assistant, prefer a subagent for these so the review is
done with fresh context rather than by the same pass that wrote the code.
Maintainers keep local agent configurations that automate this; those
configs are not part of the public repository, so do not assume a
particular agent name or dispatch mechanism exists.

### Help documentation

**Trigger** — before finishing, if any of these paths were
edited/created and no matching update to `help_content/` was made:

- `templates/admin/**/*.html`
- `**/admin.py` (Django admin classes)
- `**/views/admin*.py` or `**/views.py` when the view backs an admin
  page
- Admin CSS: `core/static/core/admin/**/*.css` or any app CSS scoped
  to admin (`.admin-*`, `.change-*` selectors)
- New admin URL patterns

Write the merchant-facing help content, including screenshots and correct
file placement under `help_content/`.

**Skip** if the change is invisible to merchants (rename of a private
helper, adding a comment, log line, non-admin URL, etc.).

### Security review

**Trigger** — before finishing, if any of these were touched:

- `**/views.py`, `**/api_views.py`, `**/viewsets.py`
- `**/forms.py`, `**/serializers.py`
- `**/middleware.py` or middleware wiring in settings
- `**/authentication.py`, `**/permissions.py`, anything under
  `accounts/`
- `payment_methods/**`, `payments/**`
- CSP config, cookie config, session config, or `SECURE_*` settings
- `**/templates/**/*.html` where user-authored content is rendered
- File-upload handling
- SQL via `.raw()` / `.extra()` / cursors
- Frontend JS that touches auth, payment, or user input

Review the change for the CSP / injection / auth pattern violations
listed in the *Security & CSP hardening* section above. `/security-review`
covers this if you have no other tooling.

### Permissioning

**Trigger** — you added or changed a staff-facing admin view or endpoint: a
`@staff_member_required` function view, a custom admin AJAX endpoint, or a DRF
admin viewset.

`@staff_member_required` proves the caller is *a* staff user; it does not prove
they may perform *this* action. Gate the view on a capability, using the helpers
in `staff_roles/decorators.py`:

- `@requires_category("orders", "full")` — the default. Resolves through the
  `StaffRole` category model, the same way the mobile Admin API's
  `category_permission()` and Django admin's `has_perm()` do. Pair it with
  `@staff_member_required` (which still handles the login redirect); pass
  `ajax=True` on XHR endpoints to return a JSON 403.
- `@requires_permission("catalog.view_brand")` — when a precise Django model
  permission fits better than a whole category.
- `@any_staff` — only when a view is *intentionally* open to every staff user (a
  shared dashboard, a non-sensitive lookup). It records the decision.

Superusers and single-owner stores pass automatically, so this adds no friction
to small installs while staying enforceable for multi-staff/enterprise ones.

`scripts/permission_coverage.py` (run in pre-commit and CI) fails the build when
a **new** staff view is added with no gate. It uses a baseline so the existing
backlog doesn't block you — add a gate rather than a new baseline entry, and
shrink the baseline (`--update-baseline`) whenever you fix an old one.

**New admin models** must also be *delegatable*: slot each into a permission
category in `staff_roles/categories.py` (so a merchant can grant it to a staff
role) or, if it's genuinely superuser-only, add it to
`staff_roles/category_coverage_allowlist.txt`. `./manage.py audit_category_coverage`
(enforced by `tests/test_category_coverage.py`) fails when an admin-registered
model is neither — otherwise it silently becomes superuser-only.

### Tests

**Trigger** — after adding a new model, view, service, form, or
management command, or after a non-trivial refactor of any of the
above. Also after fixing a bug that could recur — that one ships with a
regression test.

Write tests against the changed surfaces. If an AI assistant wrote the
code, have something other than that same pass write the tests.

### Themes

Theme work belongs in the separate components repository, not here. Do
not apply theme conventions to in-repo admin CSS — see
*Theme tokens workflow* above.

## Final reminders for AI execution

1. **Map the change to the sections above before writing code.** If a
   section is silent on what you're doing, ask before assuming.
2. **Preserve every invariant.** No section here is decorative.
3. **Reuse shared helpers.** Translation widgets, `AdminUtils`,
   `AdminTabs`, `AdminListFilters`, `admin-base.css` — check what
   exists before rolling your own.
4. **Keep it theme-aware, responsive, and i18n-ready.**
5. **Do the required follow-up before finishing** — see the *Required
   follow-up work* section above. Skipping it is a correctness failure,
   not a style choice.
6. **Update this file when new rules emerge** so future runs stay
   aligned — but read the notice at the top first. This file is public.
