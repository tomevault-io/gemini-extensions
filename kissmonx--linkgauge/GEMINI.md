Guidance for AI coding agents working in this repository. Human-facing docs live in
[`README.md`](README.md) / [`README.zh-CN.md`](README.zh-CN.md) — read the README first for
what the product does; this file covers how to change it without breaking its conventions.

## What this project is

LinkGauge is a desktop network performance tester: Rust + Tauri 2 backend, Vue 3 + TypeScript
frontend. Ping uses the system command; all TCP/UDP testing runs on
[riperf3](https://github.com/therealevanhenry/riperf3), a pure-Rust iperf3 implementation
vendored at `vendor/riperf3` and compiled **into** the application.

**The zero-external-binary property is a product guarantee, not an implementation detail.**
The README and the installer notes both promise that no iperf3 (or ssh, or any other network
tool) executable is bundled, resolved, or spawned. Do not introduce a dependency that shells
out to one. When a feature needs a protocol, add a pure-Rust library — that is why the SSH
console uses `russh` rather than `Command::new("ssh")`.

## Commands

```bash
npm ci                       # install frontend deps
npm run tauri dev            # run the desktop app
npm run dev                  # browser-only preview (simulated data, see "Preview mode")
npm run build                # vue-tsc --noEmit && vite build  — run before every commit
cargo test   --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml
cargo check  --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml
cargo fmt    --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml -- --check
cargo clippy --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml --all-targets -- -D warnings
npm run tauri build          # NSIS installer (Windows) / add -- --bundles appimage,deb on Linux
```

All four checks — `npm run build`, `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` and
`cargo test` — must pass before you commit; CI runs exactly these on Windows and Linux
(`.github/workflows/ci.yml`), so a local failure is a red build. The tree is currently clean
on all four, and `clippy` is gated at `-D warnings`, so a new warning breaks the build rather
than accumulating.

## Layout

## Conventions that are easy to get wrong

### Comments and strings are in different languages, deliberately

- **Source comments are Chinese.** Match that. Comments explain *why*, not *what* — most
  existing comments document a non-obvious constraint (a race, a protocol quirk, a layout
  trap). Write that kind, or none.
- **User-visible strings are never hard-coded.** They go through `src/i18n.ts` on the
  frontend and `tr()` / `tr_format!` in Rust.

### Adding a UI string

`src/i18n.ts` defines `const zh = {...}`, derives `MessageKey` from it, then declares
`const en: Record<MessageKey, string>`. Adding a key to `zh` makes the compiler demand the
English one — so add to `zh` first and let `vue-tsc` find the gap. Keys are dotted by area
(`cfg.`, `srv.`, `ssh.`, `dash.`, `sdash.`, `st.`, `rep.`, `err.`, `log.`, `preview.`).

### Adding a backend message

Rust user-facing text uses `tr(locale, "中文", "English")` or the `tr_format!` macro. The
locale is read **live** from `AppState.locale` via `current_locale()` on each emission, not
captured at session start — switching language mid-run must change subsequent engine logs.
`runner.rs` and `ssh.rs` each define their own local copies of these helpers.

### Adding a Tauri command

1. Write it in the owning module with `#[tauri::command]`.
2. Register it in the `invoke_handler![...]` list in `lib.rs` — forgetting this compiles fine
   and fails at runtime.
3. Request/response structs get `#[serde(rename_all = "camelCase")]`, and the matching
   TypeScript interface goes in `src/types.ts`. These two files are one contract; change them
   together.
4. New long-lived state goes in a `struct XxxState` registered with `.manage()`.

### Adding shared state (the multi-window rule)

Client and server are tabs that can be dragged out into separate OS windows (`main`,
`client`, `server`). Every window runs the same `App.vue` and they stay in lockstep by
broadcasting a full state bundle. **Any state that must survive a tab being detached has to
be wired in four places:**

1. the `SyncState` interface in `types.ts`
2. `syncBundle()` in `App.vue`
3. `applySync()` in `App.vue`
4. a `watch(..., () => emitSync())` so local changes propagate

The `syncing` flag suppresses echo loops; `stateReady` stops a freshly detached window from
broadcasting its empty state over everyone else's live data. Respect both.

**Do not put high-volume data in the sync bundle.** It is serialized on every change. The SSH
console scrollback is the worked example of the alternative: each window listens to the
broadcast event itself, and a newly opened window calls `ssh_scrollback` once to prime its
buffer, using per-chunk stream offsets to discard what the snapshot already contained.

A new window label must also be added to `windows` in `src-tauri/capabilities/default.json`,
or the window loads with no IPC permissions.

### Backend → frontend events

Two broadcast channels, both `app.emit` to every window:

- `test-event` — Ping/riperf3 metrics, logs, server status heartbeats, completion, errors
- `ssh-event` — SSH console status, logs, output chunks, session end

Frontend handlers filter by session id. Note the ordering hazard both channels share: on
loopback the backend can emit before `invoke()` has returned the session id to JavaScript, so
those events are dropped. `runner.rs` works around it for the client local port (handled
before the session check); `ssh.rs` works around it by having the snapshot carry the live
connection state. If you add a "fires immediately" event, plan for this.

### Logs

`log(level, message, module)` in `App.vue`. The `module` value routes the entry:
`'server'` and `'ssh'` show in the server view, everything else in the client view, `'UI'`
shows in both and stays window-local (it is excluded from the sync bundle).

### Secrets

The iperf3 auth password, the SSH login password and the SSH key passphrase are held **in
memory only**. They are stripped before `localStorage` writes and before config export
(`withoutSecret` / `withoutSshSecret` in `App.vue`), and must be re-entered after a restart.
Non-secret fields — usernames, host names, key file paths — are persisted normally. Keep any
new credential on the same footing.

### Preview mode

`npm run dev` runs the frontend in a plain browser with no Tauri backend. Guard every
`invoke()` behind `isTauri()` and provide a fallback: simulated data, or an `infoDialog` with
a `preview.*` message. The app must not throw when opened this way.

### Styling

All CSS lives in `src/styles.css` — components carry no `<style>` blocks. Colors come from
the CSS custom properties defined in `:root` and `[data-theme='dark']`; never hard-code a hex
value, or dark mode breaks. Templates in this codebase are intentionally dense (multiple
elements per line); match the surrounding file instead of reformatting it.

## Testing

- Rust unit tests live beside the code in `#[cfg(test)] mod tests`.
- `src-tauri/tests/engine_smoke.rs` runs a real riperf3 client against a real riperf3 server
  on loopback. The SSH tests do the same with an embedded `russh` server. **Prefer this
  style**: the interesting bugs here are in protocol and timing, and both harnesses run
  offline in well under a second.
- Long-running async paths are decoupled from `AppHandle` so they can be tested — `ssh.rs`
  takes a `Sink` callback instead of emitting directly. Follow that pattern for new ones.
- There is no frontend test runner; `vue-tsc` is the frontend's safety net.

## Vendored engine

`vendor/riperf3` is upstream riperf3 plus a local patch that adds live `on_interval`
callbacks (upstream only reports intervals after a run finishes). The patch sites are marked
with `local LinkGauge patch` comments. If you upgrade the vendored source, re-apply the patch
and update the engine version notes in both READMEs.

## Releases

`release-please` (`.github/workflows/release-please.yml`) owns version numbers and tags. After
a merge to `master` it opens a release PR when there are `feat:`/`fix:`/breaking commits; on
merge of that PR it bumps the version in `Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock`, `package.json`,
`package-lock.json` and `tauri.conf.json`, rewrites `CHANGELOG.md`, and creates the `v*` tag
plus a draft GitHub Release that `release.yml` then populates with installers. **Never push a
`v*` tag or bump versions by hand** — a manual tag will conflict with the next release PR, and
a version bump commit in a normal PR is a merge-conflict mine for the automation. If a release
must be cut immediately (no `feat:`/`fix:` commits), use `workflow_dispatch` on `release.yml`
with an existing tag or a `release-as` in a release PR instead.

## Housekeeping

- Both READMEs are maintained in parallel — a feature that changes behavior updates the
  English and the Chinese one, and the feature list, command table and project tree stay in
  sync with reality.
- New third-party dependencies get an entry in `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md`.
- Work on a feature branch (`feat/…`, `fix/…`, `chore/…`), not `master`.
- Never commit `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `src-tauri/target/`, or `.zcode/`.
