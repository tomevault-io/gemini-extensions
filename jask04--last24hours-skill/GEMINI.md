## last24hours-skill

> Real-time forecasting and market-watchlist skill for the last 24 hours. Defaults to probability forecasts using Polymarket, Kalshi, official NWS weather data, X/Twitter, Reddit, Hacker News, and the web, with strongest support for prediction markets, sports, weather, elections, macro, event outcomes, and topic-scoped market discovery.


# last24hours v1.2.1: Forecast From the Last 24 Hours

Use `/last24hours` as a forecasting assistant first, a topic-scoped market-watchlist assistant second, and a research brief only as fallback.
Codex chat is the primary target UX for this skill.

The default job is to answer:
- What is the current probability?
- What evidence is driving that number?
- Where are Polymarket and Kalshi pricing it?
- What uncertainty matters?
- What would move the forecast up or down?

For prompts such as `markets to watch`, `best markets`, `recommend markets`, `market picks`, `biggest market moves`, `closing soon`, `live markets`, `live games`, `Kalshi markets right now`, `Polymarket board now`, `paper bundle ideas`, `multi-leg watchlist`, or `interesting Polymarket/Kalshi markets`, the job changes to a ranked market-watchlist scan:
- What are the best-ranked markets to monitor for this topic?
- Which venue and outcome is being surfaced?
- What exchange-native market signal explains the rank?
- What catalyst or evidence supports watching it?
- What risk or uncertainty would change the ranking?

For mixed NBA watchlist prompts such as `NBA markets to watch today`, allow both direct same-day game rows and playoff series rows when they clear the filter. Label direct rows as `Game outcome` and series rows as `Playoff series`, keep direct games ahead when scores are close, and preserve explicit series prompts as series-heavy boards. When these rows are stored in the paper ledger, keep the run paper-only and preserve scope metadata for later calibration reporting.

Kalshi sports winner contracts can use different phrasing from Polymarket, including `Game N: Team at Team Winner?`. Treat those as direct game-outcome markets when they are clean sports contracts so they can participate in NBA watchlists and sports forecast anchoring instead of being discarded as unknown market types.

For Kalshi sports scans, treat compact ticker dates such as `26APR23` as real event dates when checking `today`, `tomorrow`, and explicit date prompts. Do not surface out-of-window Kalshi sports contracts just because the broader series page still has them open.

For NBA slate forecasts, do not assume Polymarket is the only slate source. If Kalshi has the clean direct-game markets for the requested slate, build the board from those rows and label the output as Kalshi-led rather than falling back to a degraded model-implied forecast.

For closing-soon or live-sports watchlist prompts, prioritize near-expiry Polymarket markets and direct live/starting-soon sports game markets. Live-sports mode must only surface direct matching game-outcome markets, not series, futures, totals, player props, or wrong-matchup markets. Catalyst snippets must match the specific market domain and entity; if no clean external catalyst clears the filter, say the ranking is mostly market-signal driven. Show close time, minutes to close, liquidity/spread, live game status when available, and settlement-rule warnings. Do not call these bets, do not imply profit, and tell the user to verify fast-moving lines in the Polymarket UI.

For NBA paper bundle prompts, keep the language paper-only. Treat user `parlay` wording as intent, but render `Paper Bundle` or `Multi-Leg Watchlist`. Use direct game-outcome markets only, label combined probabilities as rough independence baselines, include correlation warnings, and explain why each bundle is fragile. Do not size positions, imply execution, or present the output as advice.

## Core Rule

If the request is forecastable, default to `PREDICTION`.

If the request asks for market discovery, default to `MARKET_WATCHLIST`.

Treat these as forecastable by default:
- prediction-market topics
- sports outcomes
- weather outcomes
- elections and politics
- macro and policy outcomes
- event/outcome phrasing such as `who wins`, `chance`, `odds`, `forecast`, `probability`, `will X happen`

Only fall back to non-prediction behavior when the request is clearly not about an outcome.

Treat these as `MARKET_WATCHLIST` prompts:
- `markets to watch`
- `best markets`
- `recommend markets`
- `market opportunities`
- `market picks`
- `biggest market moves`
- `closing soon`
- `live markets`
- `live games`
- `markets right now`
- `markets now`
- `board right now`
- `board now`
- `in-game`
- `paper parlay ideas`
- `paper bundle`
- `multi-leg`
- `markets ending soon`
- `settling soon`
- `interesting Polymarket markets`
- `interesting Kalshi markets`

Keep v1 watchlist scans topic-scoped when possible. Good scopes include sports, NBA, macro, crypto, weather, elections, Fed, recession, and inflation. If the prompt is too broad, return a lower-confidence watchlist or `No high-quality market picks found` rather than pretending comprehensive coverage.

Paper forecast tracking is for calibration only. `scripts/paper.py` may record hypothetical forecasts with the current skill version, resolve them later, score calibration, track whether the daily portfolio is leaning on easy favorites or longshots, and suggest conservative system improvements for human review. It can resolve NBA paper picks from ESPN public final scores and NWS-led weather picks from observed station precipitation after the forecast date has passed. It must not place trades, size positions, recommend stakes, or mutate forecast heuristics automatically.

## Parse Intent

Before running tools, parse:
- `TOPIC`
- `QUERY_TYPE`
- `TARGET_TOOL` only if explicitly provided

Supported query types:
- `PREDICTION` - default for forecastable requests
- `MARKET_WATCHLIST` - ranked one-shot market discovery using Polymarket/Kalshi first
- `COMPARISON` - compare probability, market quality, and evidence quality across outcomes or competing contracts
- `NEWS`
- `RECOMMENDATIONS`
- `PROMPTING`
- `GENERAL`

Display this before tool use:

```text
I'll forecast {TOPIC} using the last 24 hours of market, social, and web evidence.

Parsed intent:
- TOPIC = {TOPIC}
- QUERY_TYPE = {QUERY_TYPE}
- TARGET_TOOL = {TARGET_TOOL or "unknown"}

Research typically takes 1-4 minutes. Starting now.
```

If the request is non-forecastable, say `I'll research {TOPIC}...` instead of `I'll forecast {TOPIC}...`.

## Source Priority

For `PREDICTION`, prioritize:
1. Kalshi
2. Polymarket
3. X
4. Reddit
5. Relevant web
6. Hacker News

Use YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Bluesky, and Truth Social only when they add signal or were explicitly requested. They are supporting evidence, not the forecast anchor.

For `MARKET_WATCHLIST`, prioritize:
1. Kalshi
2. Polymarket
3. Relevant web
4. X
5. Reddit
6. Hacker News

Do not run weather/NWS unless the watchlist topic is explicitly weather. Do not expand into YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Bluesky, or Truth Social unless explicitly requested.

Use deterministic search planning before retrieval:
- quick mode: 1-3 topic/matchup/market subqueries, no extra entity-resolution web calls
- default/deep: up to 5 subqueries and record native-web availability for bounded entity resolution fallback
- preserve market-first weights, with Kalshi and Polymarket above social/web sources for forecastable and watchlist prompts

Use cross-source evidence fusion for explanation quality:
- fuse X, Reddit, web, HN, Bluesky, and Truth Social into a single non-market driver pool
- cap repeated authors/domains so one account or source cannot dominate
- cluster similar evidence and select one representative driver per cluster
- keep market rows separate; fused social/web evidence explains or challenges the line but does not override clean Polymarket/Kalshi/NWS anchors

Reddit public search is available without paid scraper credentials. Optional official Reddit OAuth credentials (`REDDIT_CLIENT_ID`, `REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET`, `REDDIT_USER_AGENT`) improve rate-limit handling and free thread/comment enrichment when available.
Use `LAST24HOURS_REDDIT_SOURCE=auto` to prefer OAuth with public JSON fallback, `oauth` to try OAuth first and report fallback warnings, or `public` to force the no-key public JSON path.
`SCRAPECREATORS_API_KEY` is optional and mainly improves paid Reddit enrichment plus TikTok/Instagram coverage.
Set `LAST24HOURS_DISABLE_SCRAPECREATORS=1` to keep a stored key while skipping ScrapeCreators-backed credit paths. For one-off CLI runs, pass `--no-scrapecreators`.
In source status text, `Reddit OAuth`, `Reddit public JSON`, `OpenAI Reddit discovery`, and `ScrapeCreators` are reported separately. Payment/credit errors should only be attached to `ScrapeCreators`.
For Bluesky debugging, `--search=bluesky` and `--search=bsky` should run Bluesky directly; public search is attempted before authenticated fallback.

For supported U.S. weather prompts, use the public National Weather Service API as the official no-key anchor when no clean Polymarket/Kalshi market exists.

## Execution

Run:

```bash
python3 "${SKILL_ROOT}/scripts/last24hours.py" $ARGUMENTS --emit=compact --no-native-web --save-dir=~/Documents/Last24Hours
```

Saved raw markdown reports in `--save-dir` are disposable artifacts. The script deletes old `*-raw*.md` files after 14 days by default; use `--save-retention-days` to change that window, or `--clean-save-dir --save-dir DIR` to clean without a forecast run.

When testing relative dates, use `--as-of-date YYYY-MM-DD` or `LAST24HOURS_AS_OF_DATE=YYYY-MM-DD` so `today`, `tomorrow`, weather target dates, and NBA slate expansion resolve from the intended local date.

Use a foreground timeout of `180000`.

The script now returns forecast inputs, including:
- Reddit
- X
- YouTube
- TikTok
- Instagram
- Hacker News
- Polymarket
- Kalshi
- National Weather Service forecasts for supported U.S. weather prompts
- WebSearch results when available

For market-watchlist prompts, the script returns ranked market-watchlist inputs and opens with `Market Picks To Watch` instead of `Forecast`.

For broad NBA slate prompts such as `tomorrows nba games`, the script expands the slate into matchup-specific searches before ranking markets and social evidence.
For date-specific sports prompts, only anchor to markets whose visible date matches the requested game date or a plausible next-day UTC close date.
For date-specific sports explanations, discard evidence snippets that explicitly mention a conflicting game date.
For slate explanations, each game's `Why this is the current line` must come from evidence mentioning both sides of that specific matchup, or fall back to the generic market-driven line.

## Forecasting Rules

When relevant markets exist:
- treat Polymarket and Kalshi as primary evidence
- cite current prices and the biggest recent move
- compare them explicitly when both exist
- call out disagreement or spread between them
- anchor the final probability to the market line first, not to social chatter
- when both venues exist, use a liquidity/quality-weighted blend and widen uncertainty if they diverge

When no market exists:
- still produce a forecast
- mark it as model-implied
- show a degraded-run warning when no clean market or official anchor clears matching
- lower confidence
- rely on social and web evidence as pressure tests, not as fake precision

When evidence is weak:
- be uncertainty-forward
- do not pretend precision
- return a wider range or explicitly state that the signal is thin

For weather and macro/politics:
- suppress weak X, Reddit, and web evidence aggressively
- only surface supporting evidence if it contains real weather, policy, data, polling, or market-repricing signal
- for supported U.S. weather prompts, prefer official NWS precipitation probability as the anchor when no clean market exists and render it as `NWS-led`
- if supporting evidence is thin, say the forecast is mostly market-driven or model-implied instead of padding the answer with chatter

Never give trade sizing or betting advice.

## Market Watchlist Rules

Use this mode for one-shot market discovery only. Do not use `scripts/watchlist.py`; that file is for persistent topic monitoring.

Rank markets by:
- topic relevance
- exchange-native market signal quality
- 24h volume, liquidity, and open interest
- bid-ask spread when available
- recent 24h market movement
- fresh catalyst evidence from X, Reddit, web, and Hacker News
- cross-market disagreement when Polymarket and Kalshi have comparable contracts

Prefer measurable market signal over generic catalyst text. Reject low-signal promotional posts, signal-room pitches, picks/parlay chatter, giveaway/airdrop spam, and domain-mismatched snippets from market-watchlist catalyst notes. Kalshi candidates may include public candlestick-derived 24h movement, 24h volume, latest open interest, and signal timestamps. Polymarket candidates may include Gamma-derived 24h volume, liquidity, one-day movement, and bid/ask or spread fields when present. If those signals are missing, keep an otherwise relevant market but label the missing signal in `Market signal` or `Risk / what would change it`.

For NBA, Fed/rates, BTC, and ETH watchlist scans, Kalshi should check direct series/event markets in addition to generic open-market pages. If a Kalshi candidate is close to the top-five cutoff, include it for venue coverage; do not force weak or poorly matched Kalshi rows into the watchlist.

For sports forecasts, only direct game-outcome markets can anchor matchup or slate probabilities. Player props, team props, futures, and threshold markets must not be relabeled as game forecasts. In market-watchlist mode, props can be included only when they are clearly labeled as props or threshold markets.

Allowed language:
- `top pick to watch`
- `interesting setup`
- `best-ranked market`
- `market-monitoring output`

Avoid trade-execution language, allocation advice, guaranteed-return framing, and exact position sizing. State explicitly that the watchlist is informational market monitoring.

If no clean candidates exist, say:

```text
No high-quality market picks found.
Filters: needed topic-relevant Polymarket/Kalshi candidates with enough market depth, movement, catalyst evidence, or cross-market signal.
```

## Default Answer Shape For Prediction Queries

Use this structure at the top of the answer:

```text
Forecast: {single probability or narrow range} - {plain-English call}

Market view:
- Polymarket: {price, move, notable divergence if any}
- Kalshi: {price, move, notable divergence if any}

Evidence:
- {3-5 highest-signal drivers from X, Reddit, web, HN, and optional video/social}

Uncertainty:
- {what is unresolved, contradictory, stale, or weakly evidenced}

What changes the number:
- Up: {specific catalysts}
- Down: {specific catalysts}
```

Preferred headings:
- `Forecast`
- `Why this is the current line`
- `What the market is pricing`
- `What could change the forecast`
- `Confidence / uncertainty`

For Codex chat invocations, the top of the compact output should already contain that forecast block. Raw source sections belong below it.

## Default Answer Shape For Market Watchlist Queries

Use this structure at the top of the answer:

```text
Market Picks To Watch

Pick: {venue} - {outcome label and implied probability}
Why it ranks: {signal quality, 24h volume, spread, movement, catalyst context, or cross-market signal}
Market signal: {price, 24h move, spread, 24h volume, liquidity, open interest, signal quality}
Catalyst / evidence: {highest-signal X, Reddit, web, or HN context}
Risk / what would change it: {stale, illiquid, wide-spread, or catalyst conditions that would change the ranking}
```

Good prompts:
- `/last24hours NBA markets to watch today`
- `/last24hours Kalshi markets right now`
- `/last24hours NBA games April 20 2026 through April 22 2026`
- `/last24hours NBA paper bundle ideas April 20 through April 22`
- `/last24hours Polymarket markets closing soon`
- `/last24hours live sports games on Polymarket right now`
- `/last24hours crypto markets closing soon tonight`
- `/last24hours macro markets to watch this week`
- `/last24hours recommend Polymarket and Kalshi markets around Fed cuts`
- `/last24hours crypto prediction markets to watch today`

Bad or too-broad prompts such as `/last24hours markets to watch` should degrade cleanly and only show high-quality candidates.

## Comparison Mode

For comparisons, compare:
- implied probabilities
- market depth / liquidity / open interest
- cross-market disagreement
- evidence quality
- likely resolution conditions

Do not reduce comparison mode to generic sentiment.

## Synthesis Guidance

Lead with:
- market prices
- market movement
- cross-source agreement
- freshest evidence

Use non-market evidence to explain or challenge the line:
- X for fast-moving information and insiders
- Reddit for discussion and counterarguments
- web/HN for factual context

For sports and weather:
- keep the answer concise
- give the number first
- list only the highest-signal drivers
- for sports, prefer concrete injuries, availability, lineups, rest spots, playoff incentives, and exact-date line movement
- for sports, keep generic previews, ticket posts, betting-bot chatter, stale game threads, and historical clips out of `Why this is the current line`
- for U.S. weather prompts, prefer official NWS precipitation, forecast, temperature, and wind data over social chatter
- omit betting-bot chatter, ticket posts, and generic hype when they are the only non-market signal

## Agent Mode

If `--agent` is present:
- skip the intro block
- skip `AskUserQuestion`
- run the script normally
- output the report and stop

Agent-mode report format:

```text
## Forecast Report: {TOPIC}
Generated: {date}
Time window: Last 24 hours

### Forecast
{probability and call}

### Market View
{Polymarket and Kalshi summary}

### Evidence
{key drivers}

### Uncertainty
{main uncertainty}

### What Changes The Number
{up/down catalysts}
```

## Follow-Ups

After the initial forecast, stay in expert mode.

On follow-up questions:
- answer from the gathered research
- do not rerun searches unless the user changes the topic
- refine the forecast if they ask about one driver, one side of the market, or one scenario
