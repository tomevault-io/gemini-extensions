## Step 0.5 — Load Knowledge Base (runs before any requirements analysis)

The `knowledge-base/` folder is the agent's **persistent, per-product memory**. It carries product knowledge across sessions so the agent is not starting cold from only the feature description and URL.

**Knowledge is per-product; skills are global.** Sub-agents in `.claude/agents/` are *how* to test. The knowledge base is *what* the product does — carried across sessions so the agent is never starting cold.

**The product folder is keyed by `QASE_PROJECT` from `.claude/settings.json`** → `knowledge-base/<QASE_PROJECT>/`

**When this step runs:** at the start of any WAY that analyzes requirements — **WAY 1, WAY 3, and WAY 4**. Skip it for WAY 2 (quick bug report) and WAY 5 (Jira ticket creation), which don't generate or evaluate test scenarios.

**What to do:**
1. Determine the active product's Qase project code from `QASE_PROJECT` in `.claude/settings.json`.
2. Read all four files from `knowledge-base/<QASE_PROJECT>/` if the folder exists:
   - `product-flows.md` — real navigation flows
   - `business-rules.md` — the authoritative bug-vs-intended oracle
   - `feature-map.md` — feature dependencies / blast radius
   - `known-defects.md` — historical weak spots and filed tickets
3. Hold this content as context for every sub-agent that follows (`analyze-requirements`, `write-test-cases`, `generate-edge-cases`, `execute-tests`, `classify-severity`, `report-bug`, `review-test-cases`, `report-session`).
4. **Never load another product's folder.** Only `knowledge-base/<QASE_PROJECT>/` is in scope for the session.
5. If the product folder or a file is missing or empty, continue silently — the KB is optional and additive. Never block a session because the KB is absent. You may note once that no KB exists for this product yet and suggest `cp -r knowledge-base/_TEMPLATE knowledge-base/<QASE_PROJECT>` to start one.

**How the KB changes behavior:**
- **Business rules outrank heuristics.** If observed behavior contradicts a `BR-xx` rule, it is a **confirmed** defect — cite the rule ID in the bug report. If behavior is unusual but matches a rule, it is **not** a bug.
- **Spec vs KB conflict:** if session requirements contradict a knowledge-base rule, flag the contradiction in the analysis output instead of silently choosing one.
- **Feature map drives regression scope:** include a feature's `Used by` chain as regression-risk areas in the testing scope.
- **Known defects drive probing & dedup:** generate extra edge cases around `Open`/`Intermittent` entries; before filing a bug, check `known-defects.md` and reference an existing `Ref` instead of filing a duplicate.

---

## Step 0.6 — Grow the Knowledge Base (runs at the end of every WAY 1 session)

The knowledge base must **compound** — each session should leave the agent smarter for the next one. At the end of WAY 1 (during `report-session`), propose updates to the active product's `knowledge-base/<QASE_PROJECT>/` files:

- **New confirmed defect** → append a row to `known-defects.md` (Ref = the Jira key just filed, Area, Symptom, Status=Open, Note for agent)
- **New flow exercised** that wasn't documented → add it to `product-flows.md`
- **New rule learned** from the Jira ticket or observed enforcement → add a `BR-xx` row to `business-rules.md`
- **New dependency discovered** → update `feature-map.md`

Present the proposed additions as a short diff and apply them (write the files directly, then report what was added in the session summary). Never invent facts — only record what the session actually established.

**On-demand learning:** if the user states a product fact at any time (e.g. "the upload limit is now 20 MB"), write it into the correct file of the active product's KB and confirm where it was saved.

---

## MCP Server Lifecycle

When any keyword below triggers you, verify these MCP servers are active before doing anything else:
- **Playwright MCP** — browser automation (already configured)
- **Qase MCP** — test case management (already configured)
- **Jira MCP** — bug reporting via mcp-atlassian (already configured)

All MCP servers are pre-configured in `.mcp.json`. If any server fails to connect, tell the user which one and stop — do not proceed without all three.

Do not attempt to start or stop MCP servers manually — they are managed by the Claude Code runtime.

---

## WAY 1 — Full QA Session

**Trigger keywords:** `test it`, `test this`, `run QA`, `start testing`, `qa this`

### Step 0: Gather Inputs

You need TWO things before starting. If either is missing, ask the user before proceeding:
- **Requirements**: plain text, OR a Jira issue key (e.g. LSY-42), OR a Jira URL
- **App URL**: the staging/test URL to test against

If a Jira issue key or URL is provided:
1. Use the Jira MCP to fetch the issue
2. Extract: summary, description, acceptance criteria, comments, linked issues
3. Use this as your requirements — proceed without asking the user again

---

### Phase 1: Analyze Requirements

0. Run **Step 0.5 — Load Knowledge Base** first if not already loaded this session
1. Run the `analyze-requirements` sub-agent — pass the loaded knowledge base as context
2. If acceptance criteria are present in BDD/user-story format, also run `parse-criteria`
3. Identify all scenarios: happy path, negative, edge cases, boundary values, security
4. Cross-reference the knowledge base: ground happy paths in `product-flows.md`, treat `business-rules.md` as the bug oracle, add `feature-map.md` `Used by` chains as regression risks, and probe `known-defects.md` weak spots

---

### Phase 2: Create & Upload Test Cases

1. Run the `write-test-cases` sub-agent — generate every possible scenario
2. Run the `generate-edge-cases` sub-agent — add boundary and attack cases
3. Upload all test cases to Qase via Qase MCP, organized in suites/folders by area
4. Confirm each upload, log the TC IDs

---

### Phase 3: Create Test Cycle

1. Create a Qase Test Run named: `[Feature] — [YYYY-MM-DD] — Agent Session`
2. Add all newly created test cases to the run
3. Confirm the run ID before proceeding

---

### Phase 4: Execute Test Cycle

1. Run the `execute-tests` sub-agent
2. Open the app URL via Playwright MCP
3. Execute each test case in the run systematically
4. On every failure: capture screenshot + console log + network log immediately
5. Mark each test result in Qase in real-time (pass / fail / blocked)

---

### Phase 5: Report Issues from Test Execution

For each failed test case:
1. Run the `classify-severity` sub-agent
2. Run the `report-bug` sub-agent — format the full Jira report
3. File to Jira via Jira MCP with screenshot + logs attached
4. Link the Jira key back to the failed Qase test case

---

### Phase 6: Session Summary

1. Run the `report-session` sub-agent
2. Update all Qase results, link failures to Jira keys, close the test run
3. Print summary to terminal:
   - Total test cases created: N
   - Results: X passed, Y failed, Z blocked
   - Bugs filed: N (list each Jira key + title)
   - Qase test run link
   - Jira issues link (filtered view if possible)
4. Save summary as: `./qa-artifacts/session-[YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM].md`

---

## WAY 2 — Quick Issue Report

**Trigger keywords:** `report it`, `log this`, `raise this`, `create a bug`, `file this issue`

Handle inline — do NOT spawn a sub-agent, do NOT fetch any Jira ticket.
1. Parse the user's input in format: `[Portal], [Precondition], [Steps > Steps > Observe]`
2. Derive title, expected result, and full description — build the description as **ADF JSON** (see report-bug SKILL.md Description Format); never use Markdown asterisks, they render as literal characters in Jira Cloud
3. Look up assignee accountId via Jira MCP (`get_jira_current_user` — no params needed)
4. Call `create_jira_issue` directly — file immediately
5. Print summary: Jira key, title, priority, assignee, Jira link

---

## WAY 3 — Write Test Cases

**Trigger keywords:** `write it`, `write test cases`, `generate test cases`

### Step 0: Gather Inputs

**Mandatory — ask before proceeding if missing:**
- Requirements: plain text description OR a Jira issue key (e.g. SCRUM-42) OR a Jira URL

If the mandatory input is missing, ask exactly:
> "Please provide requirements as plain text or a Jira ticket key before I proceed."

Do not proceed until the mandatory input is supplied.

**Optional — use if provided, skip silently if not:**
- **App/Feature URL** — adds UI context to test step descriptions
- **Figma link** — used as design reference in test case descriptions
- **Screenshot(s)** — analysed to understand current UI state and component layout

If a Jira key or URL is provided as requirements:
1. Fetch the issue via Jira MCP
2. Extract: summary, description, acceptance criteria, comments
3. Use this as requirements — do not ask the user again

---

### Phase 1: Analyze Requirements

0. Run **Step 0.5 — Load Knowledge Base** first if not already loaded this session
1. Run the `analyze-requirements` sub-agent — pass the loaded knowledge base as context
2. If acceptance criteria are in BDD/user-story format, also run `parse-criteria`
3. If App URL provided, note it as context for UI-facing test step wording
4. If Figma link provided, note it as design reference in test case descriptions
5. If screenshots provided, describe observed UI state and factor into test scenarios
6. Cross-reference the knowledge base: ground happy paths in `product-flows.md`, treat `business-rules.md` as authoritative expected behavior, and use `feature-map.md` + `known-defects.md` to widen coverage into regression-risk and historically weak areas

---

### Phase 2: Write & Upload Test Cases

1. Run the `write-test-cases` sub-agent — generate every scenario
2. Run the `generate-edge-cases` sub-agent — add boundary and attack cases
3. Upload all test cases to Qase via Qase MCP, organized in suites by area
4. Confirm each upload and log the TC IDs

---

### Phase 3: Summary

Print to terminal:
```
Feature analyzed: [name]
Total test cases created: N
Suites created: [list suite names]
TC IDs: [list of Qase TC IDs]
Optional inputs used: [App URL / Figma / Screenshot / none]
Qase project: [QASE_PROJECT]
```

Save summary to: `./qa-artifacts/testcases-[YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM].md`

---

## WAY 4 — Review & Update Existing Test Cases

**Trigger keywords:** `review it`, `review test cases`, `update test cases`

### Step 0: Gather Inputs

**Mandatory — ask before proceeding if either is missing:**
- **Qase suite link or suite ID** — the suite to review
- **Requirements source** — one of: App/feature URL OR Jira ticket key/URL

If a Jira key or URL is provided, fetch the issue via Jira MCP and extract summary, description, and acceptance criteria.

If either mandatory input is missing, ask:
> "Please provide the Qase suite link and requirements (app URL or Jira ticket) before I proceed."

---

### Phase 1: Fetch Suite & Requirements

0. Run **Step 0.5 — Load Knowledge Base** first if not already loaded this session
1. Parse the suite ID and project code from the Qase URL
2. Call Qase MCP to list all test cases in the suite
3. Fetch full details of each test case (title, severity, priority, type, layer, behavior, precondition, steps)
4. If Jira link provided, fetch the issue via Jira MCP and extract requirements
5. If app URL provided, navigate to it via Playwright MCP — explore all screens, forms, buttons, and UI states; build a UI inventory of every element found; use this to verify test case accuracy and identify coverage gaps
6. Use the knowledge base during review: validate expected results against `business-rules.md`, check coverage against `product-flows.md`, and treat `feature-map.md` + `known-defects.md` as sources of missing regression scenarios in gap analysis

---

### Phase 2: Review & Update Each Test Case

Run the `review-test-cases` sub-agent.

The rule for every field is: **if empty → fill it; if already set → verify correctness → update if wrong.**

For every test case, check and update via Qase MCP:
- **Title** — if empty: derive from steps; if set: verify `Verify [outcome] when [condition]` format, rewrite if vague or wrong format
- **Type** → if empty or wrong: set to `Regression` (always, no exceptions)
- **Layer** → if empty or wrong: set to `E2E` (always, no exceptions)
- **Behavior** → if empty: classify as `Positive` or `Negative` from scenario signals; if set: re-evaluate and correct if misclassified
- **Precondition** — if empty: derive from steps; if set: verify completeness, expand if vague; remove any email addresses or personal data (data belongs in step Test Data only — precondition describes role + state + starting point only)
- **Steps / Action** — if empty: flag as "manual input required"; if set: verify one action per step, imperative form, specific UI labels, observation step at end
- **Steps / Expected Result** — if empty on any step: add observable outcome in present tense; if set: verify it is specific and not repeating the action
- **Steps / Test Data** — if empty and step requires input: add placeholder values (e.g. `valid-email@test.com`, `ValidPass@123`); if set: verify it actually triggers the expected condition; replace any real personal data with safe placeholders; never use real email addresses
- **Severity & Priority** — evaluated as a pair using the Severity × Priority matrix; if either is missing: set both from matrix; if set but contradicts matrix: update both
- **Grammar & Spelling** — fix all errors in all text fields, enforce imperative tense

---

### Phase 3: Gap Analysis & New Test Cases

1. Compare existing test case coverage against the requirements
2. Identify missing scenarios (happy path, negative, boundary, permission, error recovery)
3. For each gap, create a new test case in the same suite via Qase MCP
4. Apply all field standards: Type=Regression, Layer=E2E, correct Behavior, full precondition

---

### Phase 4: Summary

1. Print and save a review report to `./qa-artifacts/review-[YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM].md`:
   - Total test cases reviewed: N
   - Updated: N — list each TC ID, title, and what changed
   - Newly created: N — list each TC ID and title
   - No changes: N — list TC IDs
2. Return the summary to the user

---

## WAY 5 — Create QA Jira Tickets from Epic

**Trigger keywords:** `create it`, `create jira`, `create qa tickets`, `jira tickets for epic`, `create tickets`

### Step 0: Gather Inputs

**Mandatory — ask before proceeding if missing:**
- **Jira epic key or URL** — the dev epic to create QA tickets against

If the mandatory input is missing, ask exactly:
> "Please provide the Jira epic key or URL before I proceed."

**Defaults (apply unless user overrides):**
- Assignee: the requesting user
- Sprint: active sprint for the project
- Priority: Medium
- Issue Type: QA (native QA issue type in the project)
- Work Type: QA (set if available as a custom field; skip silently if not)

---

### Story Point Matrix (always apply — no exceptions)

Read the story points from each dev ticket and set QA story points using these tables:

**Retest ticket** — based on the individual child story's SP:

| Dev Story SP | QA Retest SP |
|-------------|-------------|
| 0 / unset   | 1           |
| 1           | 1           |
| 2           | 1           |
| 3           | 2           |
| 5           | 2           |
| 8           | 3           |
| 13          | 5           |
| 21+         | 8           |

**Test Case Development ticket** — based on the SUM of all child dev story SPs:

| Total Dev SP (sum of all children) | QA TC Dev SP |
|-----------------------------------|-------------|
| 0–5                               | 2           |
| 6–10                              | 3           |
| 11–20                             | 5           |
| 21–35                             | 8           |
| 36+                               | 13          |

If Jira uses a custom field for story points (commonly `story_points` or `customfield_10016`), set it on every QA ticket created. If the field is unavailable, log it in the summary and continue.

---

### Phase 1: Fetch the Epic and All Children

1. Fetch the epic via Jira MCP — extract:
   - Summary, description, acceptance criteria, Figma links, any attachments or external links
2. Fetch all child issues (stories, tasks, sub-tasks) using JQL:
   `"Epic Link" = <EPIC-KEY> OR parent = <EPIC-KEY>`
3. For each child, extract:
   - Key, summary, issue type, status, **story points**
   - Description, acceptance criteria, Figma links, comments
4. Separate into two lists:
   - **Dev tickets** (non-QA type) — these are processed to create QA tickets
   - **Existing QA tickets** — note them, do NOT create duplicates against them
5. Sum all dev child story points — use this total for the TC Dev SP matrix

**CRITICAL — Duplicate prevention:** Before creating any QA ticket, search for an existing QA ticket with the same summary pattern under the same epic. If one already exists, skip creation and note it in the summary. Never create two QA tickets for the same dev ticket.

---

### Phase 2: Create ONE Test Case Development Ticket (per epic)

Check first: if a `[QA] Test Case Development –` ticket already exists under this epic, skip and note it. Do not create a duplicate.

If it does not exist, create:

- **Summary:** `[QA] Test Case Development – <epic summary>`
- **Issue Type:** QA
- **Parent:** the epic key
- **Assignee:** requesting user (default)
- **Sprint:** active sprint
- **Priority:** Medium
- **Story Points:** TC Dev SP matrix (based on sum of all child dev SPs)
- **Description:** Compile ALL of the following from the epic AND every child dev story/task:
  - Epic description + acceptance criteria
  - Each child's key, summary, description, and acceptance criteria (labelled, in key order)
  - All Figma links found (epic + all children) in a "Design References" section
  - Any other spec/design links from descriptions or comments
- **Remote Links:** Add each Figma/spec URL as a remote link on the ticket
- **Linked Issues:** Link to the epic key (Relates)

---

### Phase 3: Create ONE Retesting Parent Ticket + ONE Sub-task per Dev Story

This is the ONLY structure. There is no alternative. Always follow this exactly:

**Step 1 — Check for existing Retesting parent ticket.**
If a `[QA] Retesting –` or `[QA] Testing –` ticket already exists under this epic, use it as the parent. Do NOT create a second one.

If it does not exist, create:

- **Summary:** `[QA] Retesting – <epic summary>`
- **Issue Type:** QA
- **Parent:** the epic key
- **Assignee:** requesting user
- **Sprint:** active sprint
- **Priority:** Medium
- **Story Points:** Sum of all sub-task SPs (update after sub-tasks are created)
- **Description:** Compiled summary of ALL dev ticket descriptions — one section per dev ticket, labelled by key and summary, in key order
- **Linked Issues:** Link to the epic key (Relates)

**Step 2 — For each dev story/task, create ONE sub-task under the Retesting parent.**

Before creating: check if a sub-task for this dev story already exists under the Retesting parent. If yes, skip it.

If it does not exist, create:

- **Summary:** `[QA] Retesting – <child story summary>`
- **Issue Type:** Sub-task (child of the Retesting parent ticket)
- **Parent:** the Retesting parent ticket
- **Assignee:** unassigned — NEVER assign sub-tasks, always leave blank
- **Sprint:** inherit from parent or set explicitly
- **Priority:** Medium
- **Story Points:** Retest SP matrix (based on that child's dev SP)
- **Description:** The dev story's own description and acceptance criteria — copy directly from the dev ticket (labelled with dev key + summary). Include Figma links from the dev ticket.
- **Linked Issues:** Link to the child dev story key (Relates)

**Step 3 — Update Retesting parent SP** to equal sum of all sub-task SPs.

---

### Phase 4: Move All Tickets to Backlog

After all tickets are created, clear the sprint field (`customfield_10020` = null) on every newly created ticket. The user will pull tickets into a sprint manually. Do not skip this step.

---

### Phase 5: Summary

Print to terminal and save to `./qa-artifacts/jira-tickets-[YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM].md`:

```
Epic: <EPIC-KEY> — <epic summary>
Dev stories found: N | Total Dev SP: N

[QA] Test Case Development: <KEY> — SP: N — <new/existing> — <URL>

[QA] Retesting parent: <KEY> — SP: N — Assigned: <name> — <new/existing> — <URL>
  Sub-tasks (all Unassigned):
    <dev-key> (Dev SP: N) → <QA-KEY> — SP: N — <new/skipped> — <URL>
    ...

All tickets moved to backlog: yes / errors listed
Assignee: TC Dev + Retesting parent = <name> | Sub-tasks = Unassigned
Total new tickets created: N
Total QA SP: N
Figma links: N found (list them)
Errors: none / list any
```

---

## Global Rules

- **Never start testing** without BOTH requirements and app URL confirmed
- **Load the knowledge base** (Step 0.5) before analyzing requirements in WAY 1, 3, and 4 — `business-rules.md` is the authoritative bug-vs-intended oracle and outranks heuristic guesses
- **Check `known-defects.md` before filing any bug** — reference an existing `Ref` instead of creating a duplicate
- **Never skip artifact capture** on any failure
- **Always link** Jira issues back to Qase test cases
- **Save all screenshots/logs** to `./qa-artifacts/`
- **Jira project**: use `JIRA_PROJECT` from environment
- **Qase project**: use `QASE_PROJECT` from environment
- If a Qase or Jira MCP call fails, log the error, skip that single operation, and continue — do not abort the entire session
- All sub-agents (`analyze-requirements`, `write-test-cases`, `generate-edge-cases`, etc.) live in `.claude/agents/` — invoke them by name using the Agent tool

---

## Sub-Agent Invocation Sequence

| When | Sub-Agent | Triggered By |
|------|-----------|--------------|
| Before analysis (WAY 1/3/4) | Step 0.5 — Load Knowledge Base | Any session that analyzes requirements |
| Session starts | `analyze-requirements` | User provides URL + feature + spec |
| Acceptance criteria present | `parse-criteria` | BDD/user story format detected |
| Analysis complete | `write-test-cases` | Requirements analyzed |
| Main cases written | `generate-edge-cases` | Automatically after write-test-cases |
| Test execution begins | `execute-tests` | Phase 4 starts |
| Bug found | `classify-severity` | Before filing any issue |
| Bug classified | `report-bug` | After severity assessed (WAY 1) |
| All tests executed | `report-session` | Phase 7 starts |
| User says "report it" | Jira MCP directly — no sub-agent | WAY 2 triggered |
| User says "write it" | `analyze-requirements` → `write-test-cases` → `generate-edge-cases` | WAY 3 triggered |
| User says "review it" | `review-test-cases` | WAY 4 triggered |
| User says "create it" / "create jira" | Jira MCP directly (no sub-agent needed) | WAY 5 triggered |
