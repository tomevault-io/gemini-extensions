# Claude Code Instructions

## Pre-Commit Requirements

Before creating any git commit, you MUST run `just pre-commit`.

Only proceed with the commit if it passes. If it fails, fix the issues first.

**Exception:** If the commit contains only documentation and markdown changes (`.md` files), you may skip `just pre-commit`.

`just pre-commit` intentionally runs generation and formatting steps that may modify files you did not edit directly (including markdown). Treat these diffs as expected outputs of the check pipeline.

`just pre-commit` also runs `just check-opencode-guardrails-autofix`, which may auto-sync fork-boundary manifest drift in `packages/opencode/docs/upstream-sync/fork-boundary-manifest.json` when drift is the only issue.

If those diffs are mechanical (generation/format/lint output only), they should be committed with the related change. Do not treat them as noise and do not leave them uncommitted.

Common expected examples (non-exhaustive):
- `packages/opencode/packages/sdk/openapi.json`
- `packages/opencode/README.md` (including normalized markdown formatting / generated sections)
- `packages/core/README.md` (synced by hook)
- `bun.lock` files

Required post-`just pre-commit` checklist:
1. Check `git status` (superproject) and `git -C packages/opencode status` (submodule).
2. Review all newly changed files and confirm they are mechanical (no unintended behavior changes).
3. Commit/push submodule generated changes first when present.
4. Run `just update-opencode-commit`.
5. Commit/push the superproject pointer + Dockerfile pin update when changed.

## Bun Lockfile Updates

`bun.lock` file updates are expected in this repository across all `bun.lock` files when changing versions of our own packages (for example `packages/cli-node`, `packages/core`, and related workspace packages). They can also be produced by normal `just pre-commit`/build flows.

When these `bun.lock` changes are tied to intended package/version updates, they are valid and should be committed with the related change. Do not treat them as unexpected noise.
This same expected-and-commit rule applies to other mechanical formatter/generator outputs from `just pre-commit`, including markdown rewrites.

## Project Structure

This is a polyglot monorepo with Rust and TypeScript:

- `packages/core/` - Rust core library with NAPI-RS bindings
- `packages/cli-rust/` - Rust CLI binary
- `packages/cli-node/` - Node.js CLI wrapper
- `packages/opencode/` - Git submodule pointing to our fork of the opencode repository. We own this fork and can freely modify, commit, and push changes to it.

## Fork Isolation (Upstream Modification Policy)

The `packages/opencode/` submodule is a fork that syncs from upstream every 2 hours. To minimize merge conflicts:

- **Prefer putting new code in `fork-*` packages** (`fork-auth`, `fork-config`, `fork-ui`, `fork-security`, `fork-terminal`, `fork-cli`, `fork-provider`, `fork-tests`). These are ours and never conflict with upstream.
- **Minimize modifications to non-fork packages** (`app`, `opencode`, `sdk`, `ui`, `util`). When changes to upstream code are needed, keep the diff as small as possible — typically just an import and a single function call that delegates to a `fork-*` package.
- **Do not refactor upstream code.** Even if upstream code has bugs or poor patterns, fix only what directly blocks our users. Leave broader cleanups to upstream — they will fix their own bugs over time. Every line we change in upstream files is a potential merge conflict.
- **Tolerate imperfect upstream code.** If an upstream bug doesn't affect our users, leave it alone. If it does affect our users, fix it with the smallest possible diff (inline changes > new imports > new files).
- Use thin re-export shims in upstream packages that delegate to `fork-*` implementations when hooks are needed.

## Key Commands

```bash
just setup       # First command after clone/worktree init (hooks + deps + submodule bootstrap)
just build       # Build all packages
just test        # Run all tests
just e2e         # Run e2e tests (Playwright, boots server in-process)
just fmt         # Format all code
just lint        # Lint all code
just pre-commit  # Format, lint, build, test, and e2e
just clean       # Clean build artifacts
just run <args>  # Run CLI with arguments (e.g., just run status)
just dev         # Start local runtime (local submodule + cached sandbox rebuild)
```

Run `bash scripts/check-dev-prereqs.sh` to verify all required and optional tools are installed. Then run `just setup` before any other project command after cloning this repo. In new worktrees, initialize the submodule first with `git submodule update --init --recursive`, then run `just setup`.

Setup reference:
- Rust toolchain: `1.89` (from `rust-toolchain.toml`)
- Bun: `1.3.9+`
- Optional tools (`docker`, `jq`, `shellcheck`, `actionlint`, `cfn-lint`) are required only for specific flows (`just dev`, `just lint`, and CloudFormation hook checks).
- Rerun `just setup` for new clones/worktrees, if hooks are reset, or if dependency bootstrap looks stale.

## Git Hooks

This repo uses git hooks (wired via `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`, set up by `just setup`):

- **pre-commit** — Syncs README to npm packages, guards against unpublished submodule pins, runs cfn-lint on CloudFormation changes.
- **pre-push** — Validates the opencode submodule commit is published. When outgoing commits update the `packages/opencode` gitlink, it also runs strict opencode guardrails (`just check-opencode-guardrails`) before push.
- **post-merge** — After every `git pull`, automatically syncs the submodule and runs `bun install`. No manual action needed.

## README Badge Sync

`README.md` (superproject) and `packages/opencode/README.md` (submodule) use distinct generated badge blocks for different audiences.
The source of truth is `packages/opencode/packages/fork-ui/src/readme-badge-catalog.ts`.

- Run `just sync-readme-badges` after badge catalog changes.
- `just lint` and `just pre-commit` run `just check-readme-badges` and fail on drift.
- Do not manually edit badge lines between generated marker comments.

## UAT Testing

When performing manual UAT tests with the user, use justfile commands instead of the installed `occ` binary:

- Use `just run mount add /path:/container` instead of `occ mount add /path:/container`
- Use `just run status` instead of `occ status`
- Use `just dev` instead of `occ start`

This ensures tests run against the locally-built development version.

## Architecture Notes

- npm package uses compile-on-install (no prebuilt binaries)
- Users need Rust 1.89+ installed for npm install
- Config stored at `~/.config/opencode-cloud/config.json`
- Data stored at `~/.local/share/opencode-cloud/`

## Version and Metadata Sync

**Important:** `packages/core/Cargo.toml` must use explicit values (not `workspace = true`) because it's published to npm where users install it standalone without the workspace root.

When updating versions or metadata, keep these files in sync:
- `Cargo.toml` (workspace root) - `[workspace.package]` section
- `packages/core/Cargo.toml` - explicit values for version, edition, rust-version, license, repository, homepage, documentation, keywords, categories

The `scripts/set-all-versions.sh` script handles version updates automatically. For other metadata changes, update both files manually.

## Git Workflow

- Always use rebase pulls (e.g., `git pull --rebase`).
- For pushes in the `packages/opencode/` submodule (our own fork), default to the `dev` flow unless explicitly requested otherwise:
  - Rebase pull from `dev` first (for example: `git pull --rebase origin dev`).
  - Then push to the effective `dev` branch/tip for that repository (for example: `git push origin HEAD:dev`).
- For pushes in the `opencode-cloud` superproject, default to `main` unless explicitly requested otherwise:
  - Rebase pull from `main` first (for example: `git pull --rebase origin main`).
  - Then push to `main`.
- After committing and pushing changes in the `packages/opencode/` submodule, run `just update-opencode-commit` in the superproject to update the Dockerfile's `OPENCODE_COMMIT` pin. Commit and push the resulting Dockerfile change to `main`.
- After pulling the superproject, the `post-merge` hook automatically syncs the submodule and runs `bun install`. Then run `just update-opencode-commit` — if the Dockerfile changed, commit and push the update.
- **Resolving `OPENCODE_COMMIT` merge conflicts:** If a rebase or merge produces a conflict in the Dockerfile's `OPENCODE_COMMIT` line, do not manually pick a SHA. Instead, accept either side to clear the conflict markers, then run `just update-opencode-commit` to set the correct value from the current submodule state.

## Working with Git Worktrees and Submodules

Git worktrees and submodules interact poorly. Submodule metadata is partially shared across worktrees, so careless commands in one worktree can break others.

### After `git worktree add`, init the submodule

Submodules are not automatically initialized per worktree. After every `git worktree add`, run this **in the new worktree**:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Never run `git submodule sync` in worktrees

`git submodule sync` rewrites `submodule.<name>.url` in the **shared** `.git/config`, affecting all worktrees. It also mutates `core.worktree` paths in shared submodule metadata. Only run `sync` if the submodule remote URL has actually changed, and only from the main worktree with no other worktrees active.

### Never run submodule commands concurrently across worktrees

If two worktree sessions run `git submodule update` at the same time, they race on shared metadata under `.git/modules/` and `.git/config`. This causes intermittent "cannot be used without a working tree" errors and stale `core.worktree` paths. Serialize submodule operations across worktrees.

### Submodules must stay detached

The submodule should always be detached at the superproject-pinned commit. If `git submodule status` shows a branch name instead of a detached SHA, something has gone wrong (likely a `sync` or manual `checkout` inside the submodule). Fix with:

```bash
git submodule update --recursive
```

### Fork Boundary Checks in Detached Submodules

`packages/opencode/script/check-fork-boundary.ts` and `packages/opencode/script/sync-fork-boundary-manifest.ts` resolve target refs as:

1. `FORK_BOUNDARY_TARGET_REF` (when explicitly set)
2. Current symbolic branch name
3. `HEAD` fallback when detached

This branch-or-HEAD behavior prevents false passes from stale local `dev` refs in detached submodule states.

### Fixing stale `core.worktree` errors

If you see errors like "cannot be used without a working tree" or submodule commands fail mysteriously, the submodule's `core.worktree` config is pointing to a wrong or deleted worktree path. Fix from the affected worktree:

```bash
git submodule deinit -f packages/opencode
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Checking submodule health before commits

```bash
git submodule status --recursive
git diff --submodule=log
```

### Removing worktrees

Worktrees with initialized submodules may resist normal removal. Use `git worktree remove --force <path>` followed by `git worktree prune`.

### Do / Don't

- Do run `git submodule update --init --recursive` in every new worktree.
- Do keep submodules detached and pinned unless intentionally updating the pointer.
- Do check `git submodule status` before committing.
- Do serialize submodule operations — never run them concurrently across worktrees.
- Don't run `git submodule sync` unless the remote URL has changed.
- Don't run `git checkout <branch>` inside the submodule working tree.
- Don't assume submodules are ready in a fresh worktree.
- Don't ignore failed worktree removal; clean up stale metadata promptly.
