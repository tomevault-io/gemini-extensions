# Daily Drive — AI Assistant Guide

This file helps AI coding assistants (Claude Code, Gemini, Copilot, etc.) understand and work with this project. If a user asks you to help them set up Daily Drive, follow the setup workflow below.

## What This Project Does

Recreates Spotify's discontinued "Daily Drive" feature — a playlist that mixes podcast episodes and music tracks, updated automatically on a schedule. Runs on Raspberry Pi, Orange Pi, or any Linux machine.

## Tech Stack

- **Runtime:** Node.js (v18+)
- **Spotify Library:** `spotify-web-api-node` — wraps the Spotify Web API
- **Config:** YAML via `js-yaml`
- **Auth:** OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code flow with token persistence
- **Scheduling:** systemd timer or cron

## Project Structure

```
index.js              — Main script: fetches podcasts + music, mixes, updates playlist
setup.js              — One-time OAuth setup: starts local server, catches callback, saves token
taste-profile.js      — LLM-powered genre detection via Demeterics API
config.example.yaml   — Config template with comments explaining every field
config.yaml           — User's actual config (git-ignored, contains secrets)
.env                  — API keys for Demeterics etc. (git-ignored)
.spotify-token.json   — Saved OAuth tokens (git-ignored, auto-refreshed)
state.json            — Run state cache (git-ignored, tracks last episode URIs)
install.sh            — Quick installer for fresh Linux machines
systemd/              — Service + timer files for auto-scheduling
package.json          — Dependencies and npm scripts
.gitignore            — Comprehensive protection for secrets (PUBLIC REPO)
```

## Key Commands

```bash
npm install           # Install dependencies
npm run setup         # One-time Spotify authentication (deletes old token first)
npm start             # Run the playlist builder
npm test              # Dry run (shows what would happen without changing the playlist)
npm run taste         # Auto-detect genre tags via LLM (requires DEMETERICS_API_KEY in .env)
```

## Setup Workflow (for AI assistants helping users)

When a user asks you to help set up Daily Drive, follow these steps:

### 1. Spotify App Creation
Guide the user to https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard to create an app:
- **Redirect URI:** `http://127.0.0.1:8888/callback` (NOT localhost — removed Nov 2025)
- **APIs:** Check both **Web API** and **Web Playback SDK**
- **User Management:** User MUST add their Spotify email in Settings > User Management (even as app owner). Without this, playlist writes return 403 Forbidden.

### 2. Create config.yaml
Copy from `config.example.yaml` and fill in:
- `spotify.client_id` and `spotify.client_secret` from the Dashboard
- `playlist_id` — user creates an empty playlist in Spotify, shares link, extract ID
- `podcasts` — user shares Spotify show links, extract IDs
- `music` — configure top_tracks, genres, and/or source playlists

### 3. OAuth Authentication
- If on SSH/headless: user needs SSH tunnel: `ssh -L 8888:127.0.0.1:8888 user@server`
- Run `npm run setup` — it deletes any old token and starts fresh OAuth flow
- User opens the printed URL in their local browser and approves
- Token saved to `.spotify-token.json`

### 4. Test and Run
- `npm test` — dry run to verify everything works
- `npm start` — actually update the playlist
- If 403 Forbidden: check User Management in Dashboard, re-run `npm run setup`

## IMPORTANT: Security (Public Repo)

This is a PUBLIC repository. The `.gitignore` is comprehensive but verify:
- **NEVER** commit `config.yaml` (contains client_id, client_secret)
- **NEVER** commit `.spotify-token.json` (contains access/refresh tokens)
- **NEVER** commit `.env` or any `*credentials*` / `*secret*` files
- **NEVER** commit `state.json` (runtime data)
- Before any commit, run `git status` and verify no sensitive files are staged
- If a user pastes credentials in chat, remind them this goes in config.yaml (git-ignored), not in any tracked file

## How the Code Works

### Authentication Flow (setup.js)
1. Deletes any existing `.spotify-token.json` for clean auth
2. Reads Spotify credentials from `config.yaml`
3. Starts Express server on `127.0.0.1:8888`
4. Generates Spotify auth URL with required scopes
5. User approves in browser → Spotify redirects with auth code
6. Exchanges code for access + refresh tokens
7. Saves tokens to `.spotify-token.json`

### Required Scopes
```
playlist-modify-public
playlist-modify-private
playlist-read-private
playlist-read-collaborative
user-library-read
user-read-private
user-read-recently-played
user-top-read
```

### Playlist Building Flow (index.js)
1. Loads config and tokens
2. Auto-refreshes access token if expiring within 5 minutes
3. Fetches latest episodes for each podcast via `getShowEpisodes()`
4. Checks state cache — skips update if episodes haven't changed
5. Fetches music from top tracks, source playlists, and/or genre search
6. Separates pinned episodes (`position: first`) from mixable episodes
7. Places pinned episodes first, then interleaves rest using `mix_pattern`
8. Replaces playlist content via `PUT /v1/playlists/{id}/items`
9. Saves state to `state.json`

### Mix Pattern Logic
Pattern string like `"PMMMM"` where P = podcast, M = music. The pattern repeats cyclically. Pinned episodes (`position: first`) are placed before the pattern starts. When one content type runs out, remaining items of the other type are appended.

### Music Sources and 50/50 Split
Three sources can be combined:
- **Top tracks:** `getMyTopTracks()` with configurable `time_range` (short/medium/long term)
- **Genre search:** `searchTracks()` with `genre:` queries
- **Source playlists:** fetched via `/v1/playlists/{id}/items` endpoint (direct fetch, not the library's `getPlaylistTracks()` which hits the deprecated `/tracks` endpoint)

When genres are configured alongside top tracks/playlists, the script automatically splits `total_songs` **50/50**: half familiar (top tracks + playlists), half discovery (genre search). This ensures each refresh has a mix of comfort and novelty. Discovery tracks are deduplicated against familiar tracks.

### Taste Profile (taste-profile.js)
Fetches user's top tracks/artists across all time ranges, sends them to an LLM via the Demeterics API (`https://api.demeterics.com/chat/v1/chat/completions`), and writes the returned genre tags into `config.yaml`. Uses the `DEMETERICS_API_KEY` from `.env`.

Demeterics key modes:
- **BYOK (default):** Store vendor keys in Settings > Provider Keys on demeterics.ai, or use dual-key format: `dmt_YOUR_KEY;sk-YOUR_VENDOR_KEY`
- **Managed Key:** Demeterics provides vendor keys. Requires whitelisted access — email sales@demeterics.com

## Spotify API Endpoints Used

- `GET /v1/shows/{id}/episodes` — latest podcast episodes
- `GET /v1/me/top/tracks` — user's most-played tracks
- `GET /v1/search` — genre-based track discovery
- `GET /v1/playlists/{id}/items` — tracks/episodes from playlists (replaces `/tracks` which returns 403 since Feb 2026)
- `PUT /v1/playlists/{id}/items` — replace playlist contents
- `POST /v1/playlists/{id}/items` — add tracks (for batches > 100)
- `POST /api/token` — refresh OAuth token

## Config Schema (config.yaml)

```yaml
spotify:
  client_id: string       # From Spotify Developer Dashboard
  client_secret: string   # From Spotify Developer Dashboard
  redirect_uri: string    # Must be http://127.0.0.1:8888/callback

playlist_id: string       # Target playlist to populate

podcasts:                 # Array of podcast sources
  - name: string          # Display name
    id: string            # Spotify show ID
    episodes: number      # How many recent episodes (default: 1)
    position: string      # Optional: "first" to pin at start of playlist

music:
  top_tracks:             # Pull from user's most-played songs
    enabled: boolean
    time_range: string    # "short_term" | "medium_term" | "long_term"
    count: number         # Fetch pool size (default: 30)
  genres:                 # Genre-based discovery via search
    - string              # e.g., "pop", "edm", "indie pop"
  playlists:              # Pull from existing playlists
    - name: string
      id: string
  total_songs: number     # Total songs to include (default: 15)
  shuffle: boolean        # Shuffle songs (default: true)

mix_pattern: string       # e.g., "PMMMM" (default: "PMMM")

schedule:
  times:                  # Array of HH:MM strings (used by systemd timer)
    - string
  timezone: string        # IANA timezone
```

## Common Tasks for AI Assistants

### "Add support for liked/saved songs as a music source"
- Use `spotifyApi.getMySavedTracks()` in `fetchMusicTracks()`
- Add a `saved_tracks: { enabled: true, count: 50 }` option to the `music` config section
- Paginate with offset (API returns max 50 per call)

### "Add multiple playlist targets"
- Change `playlist_id` to an array of `playlists` in config
- Loop over them in `main()`, each can have its own podcasts/music/pattern

### "Add a web UI"
- Express is already a dependency
- Add routes for config editing and manual trigger
- Serve a simple HTML page with forms

## Spotify API Restrictions (as of March 2026)

- **Dev Mode requires Premium** and limits to **5 authorized users** per Client ID
- **User Management** — must add yourself in Dashboard even as app owner
- `/v1/playlists/{id}/tracks` — **returns 403 Forbidden** for both reads and writes; use `/v1/playlists/{id}/items` instead. The `spotify-web-api-node` library's `getPlaylistTracks()` still hits the old endpoint — use direct `fetch()` with `/items` instead
- `/v1/recommendations` endpoint — **REMOVED** (Nov 2024 deprecated, Feb 2026 removed)
- `/artists/{id}/top-tracks` — **REMOVED** (Feb 2026)
- Audio features (valence, energy, danceability) — **DEPRECATED** (Nov 2024)
- Artist genre tags — **empty in Dev Mode** (not usable for genre detection)
- `http://localhost` redirect URIs — **NO LONGER ALLOWED** (Nov 2025), must use `http://127.0.0.1`
- Implicit grant flow — **REMOVED** (Nov 2025)
- `getArtists()` bulk endpoint — **FORBIDDEN** in Dev Mode
- Search results capped at 10 per query in Dev Mode

## Gotchas

- Spotify tokens expire after 1 hour, but the script auto-refreshes them using the refresh token
- Refresh tokens can eventually expire after months of inactivity — user must re-run `npm run setup`
- `setup.js` deletes any existing token before starting OAuth to ensure fresh scopes
- The `/items` endpoint accepts both `spotify:track:` and `spotify:episode:` URIs
- Spotify API rate limit is generous for personal use but can hit 429 with rapid calls
- Podcast episode IDs change with each new episode — always fetch fresh
- State caching prevents unnecessary updates when episodes haven't changed — delete `state.json` to force
- NPR News Now and similar hourly news podcasts publish episodes that **expire on Spotify within hours**. If the playlist isn't refreshed frequently enough, these episodes show as unavailable. Consider running more often than twice daily if using such podcasts
