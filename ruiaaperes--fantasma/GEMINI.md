# AGENTS.md

This repository is for building Fantasma, a privacy-first, self-hosted mobile analytics stack. Treat this file as the operating manual for coding agents and contributors.

## Product Ethos

- Fantasma is install-scoped analytics, not person-scoped analytics.
- Simplicity is a product feature. Prefer fewer metrics, fewer dimensions, and fewer knobs.
- The goal is actionable understanding for mobile apps, not exhaustive analytics coverage.
- Privacy claims must be reflected in the data model. Do not add hidden identity or stitching primitives.
- Do not add user-defined event properties to the current event contract or SDK APIs unless the repository explicitly changes direction.
- If event metadata is ever introduced, treat it as event context only and never use it to reconstruct person-level identity.

## Product Rules

- Keep Fantasma simple, API-first, mobile-first, self-hosted, and privacy-first.
- The API is the primary interface.
- Everything is an event.
- Events are immutable.
- Client-side durability is required.
- Backend aggregation is asynchronous.
- Prefer deployability and clarity over infrastructure complexity.

## MVP Defaults

Until the repository says otherwise, assume the following:

- Postgres-only v1
- project-scoped multi-tenant model
- backend + public API + durable iOS SDK are the MVP
- no Redis, Kafka, or extra operational dependencies in v1

## Explicit Non-Goals

Do not add scope beyond the product vision without an explicit decision:

- feature flags
- attribution
- ad tracking
- A/B testing
- session replay
- fingerprinting
- customer data platform behavior

## Backend Rules

- Ingestion happens through `POST /v1/events`.
- Query endpoints live under `/v1/metrics/*`.
- Raw events are stored append-only.
- Workers own aggregate generation.
- Do not perform synchronous aggregation in the ingest path.
- Do not add hidden enrichment or automatic identity stitching.
- Do not add person-level identity primitives to the MVP model.
- Do not accept public session identifiers from clients; backend sessionization is internal.
- Do not infer identity from event payload fields or other client metadata.
- Scope all persisted data by `project_id`.
- DB-backed Rust tests should run fully in Docker through the repository workflow rather than host Postgres or ad hoc host `DATABASE_URL` setup.
- Keep `cargo test --workspace` on the Docker Postgres path limited to tests satisfied by containerized Postgres alone; stack-level checks belong in dedicated smoke workflows.
- When changing metric bucket schemas or replacing metric tables, preserve equivalent bounded read indexes for later-dimension filters and update the EXPLAIN-backed store tests in the same change.

## SDK Rules

- Keep the SDK API minimal and explicit.
- No swizzling.
- No automatic screen tracking.
- No hidden behavior.
- Persist tracked events before upload.
- Do not expose person-scoped identity APIs in the MVP.
- `clear()` rotates local identity without deleting already-queued events.

## Documentation Rules

Documentation is a first-class deliverable.

- Keep the canonical public product/identity/privacy stance in `README.md`.
- `README.md` is a product-facing entry point, not an implementation dump.
- Do not spread the same product-direction explanation across multiple docs with different wording.
- Any public API change must update `schemas/openapi`.
- Any event contract change must update `schemas/events`.
- Any architecture change must update `docs/architecture.md`.
- Any deployment change must update `docs/deployment.md`.
- Public-facing SDK behavior must include usage examples in docs.
- Secondary docs should describe consequences of the canonical README stance:
  - `docs/deployment.md` for operational behavior
  - `docs/architecture.md` for technical design
  - SDK docs for client behavior
  - schemas/OpenAPI for contract text
- Keep `README.md` concise and high-level; technical specifics belong in the derived docs above.
- When public direction changes, update `README.md` first, then align the derived docs.
- Avoid duplicating policy or ethos text across files unless a short local restatement is needed for clarity.
- Work is not complete until documentation is updated.

## Project Memory

Keep a running record of what changed and what is next.

- Update `docs/STATUS.md` when significant work starts.
- Update `docs/STATUS.md` when significant work finishes.
- Record open decisions, active work, and next steps.
- Use commit history for fine-grained change history and `docs/STATUS.md` for current project memory.

## Agent Workflow

Fantasma now expects Codex agents to use the installed `superpowers` skills when they apply. Repository rules in this file still win over any skill defaults.

- Use `writing-plans` before starting multi-step feature or refactor work. Save plans under `docs/superpowers/plans/` unless the task clearly does not need one.
- Use `subagent-driven-development` when executing a plan with separable tasks in the current session.
- When the user reports a bug, do not start by patching code. First write a test that reproduces the bug.
- After the reproducing test exists, use subagents to investigate and attempt fixes when that can reduce iteration time.
- Do not call a bug fixed unless the reproducing test passes after the change.
- When a benchmark, smoke run, or manual verification catches a correctness bug, reduce it to the smallest automated regression test you can in the same change. Do not leave the benchmark artifact as the only proof the bug existed.
- Use `systematic-debugging` for defects, flaky tests, or unexpected runtime behavior instead of guessing at fixes.
- Use `verification-before-completion` before claiming work is done, fixed, or passing. Do not report success without fresh command output.
- Before pushing, run the same CI-scope checks your change can affect. At minimum, workspace-affecting Rust changes must run `cargo fmt --all --check` and `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`, not just package-scoped checks; new scripts must at least pass `bash -n`.
- Treat backend/API/worker contract changes as requiring the full affected Docker-backed suite, not just selected regressions. In particular, metric/query/response-contract work must run `./scripts/docker-test.sh -p fantasma-worker --test pipeline --quiet` before push.
- After any red CI run, do not push another fix until you have pulled the failing job logs, identified the exact failing test or step, and reproduced that failing CI slice locally.
- Do not treat a targeted subset as sufficient signoff when the CI job covers a broader layer. If CI runs a broader suite for that layer, rerun that broader suite locally before push.
- Prefer the checked-in verification matrix script for repeatable local proof: `./scripts/verify-changed-surface.sh list`, `./scripts/verify-changed-surface.sh print <profile>`, or `./scripts/verify-changed-surface.sh run <profile>`.
- Dogfood operator-facing development through `fantasma-cli`. For new or touched operator workflows, prefer the CLI for manual verification, keep `scripts/cli-smoke.sh` passing, and add or extend CLI coverage instead of relying only on raw HTTP checks.
- Keep low-level service correctness checks direct when that is the right layer. The CLI is the required operator workflow proof, not a substitute for route-level ingest/API/worker tests.
- Use `requesting-code-review` or `receiving-code-review` when preparing or responding to substantive review cycles.
- Use `finishing-a-development-branch` before final handoff when the task includes branch cleanup, verification, and merge-readiness work.
- Do not use git worktrees in this repository. Work in the current checkout even if a generic skill suggests creating a worktree.
- Keep superpowers usage pragmatic: choose the smallest applicable workflow, but do not skip a clearly relevant skill.
- Treat this repository as active development and not deployed anywhere unless the user explicitly says otherwise.
- When the user confirms a checkout is deployed somewhere, treat deployed-file edits as commit-first changes: edit locally, commit locally, push, and then update the deployed checkout from git. Do not patch deployed files over SSH or copy files straight onto the host except during an explicit emergency recovery.
- Do not raise review findings about backward compatibility, upgrade paths, migration backfills, legacy client support, or existing production databases unless the user explicitly asks for deployment, rollout, upgrade, or compatibility review.
- Breaking changes are expected in this stage. Review the current intended contract and code correctness, not hypothetical deployed history.

## Build Order

When starting from a thin repository, follow this order unless there is a clear reason not to:

1. workspace bootstrap and docs scaffolding
2. shared schemas and OpenAPI
3. core types and auth model
4. ingest service
5. worker and aggregates
6. query API
7. iOS SDK

## Engineering Rules

- Fantasma prefers simple, explicit, high-performance data paths.
- We avoid steady-state designs that rely on broad recomputation.
- We narrow feature shape when necessary to preserve predictable performance and operational clarity.
- Correctness still matters, but we should choose correctness models that compose with incremental processing.
- Favor typed crate-level errors with `thiserror` in libraries.
- Reserve `anyhow` for binaries.
- Prefer simple interfaces over clever abstractions.
- Add tests for validation, auth, aggregation idempotency, and SDK durability.
- Keep comments short and explain why, not what.

## Commit Discipline

- Keep commits small and single-purpose.
- Commit after each coherent milestone.
- Do not mix refactors with feature work unless they are inseparable.
- Use clear imperative commit messages.
- Add commit bodies when the design tradeoff is not obvious.
- Well-documented commits are part of the repository memory.
