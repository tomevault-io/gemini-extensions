## Roadmap: Windows & Linux Support

This is a Tauri/Rust fork of OpenUsage. The upstream Swift rewrite is **not** happening here — development stays on Tauri/Rust, and the goal is to ship **Windows and Linux alongside macOS, both as first-class targets**.

Current state: macOS-only. The build matrix (`.github/workflows/publish.yml`) and bundle targets (`tauri.conf.json`) produce Mac builds only, and the app relies on macOS-native APIs that don't yet compile elsewhere.

Major work to get cross-platform (roughly largest-first):
- **Tray dropdown panel** — the core click-tray-to-open-panel UX is built on macOS `NSPanel` (`src-tauri/src/panel.rs`, `tauri-nspanel`, objc2, `macos-private-api`). Rebuild it as a borderless, always-on-top, non-activating window with per-OS tray positioning and hide-on-blur. Biggest single item.
- **Linux tray** — libayatana-appindicator often can't report the icon's screen position and some desktops only support a right-click menu; making the panel anchor well across desktop environments is the main Linux risk.
- **Plugin credential/usage paths** — ~20 plugins hardcode macOS paths (`~/Library/Application Support/…`, `~/.config`, `~/.local/share`). Each provider needs its Windows (`%APPDATA%`/`%LOCALAPPDATA%`) and Linux equivalents added and verified. Keychain reads throw off-macOS; add Windows Credential Manager / Linux Secret Service for parity (file-fallback plugins degrade gracefully without it).
- **Packaging & CI** — add `windows-latest` + `ubuntu-latest` to the build matrix (Linux needs webkit2gtk + appindicator system libs), and add `nsis`/`msi` and `deb`/`appimage` bundle targets. The updater, `latest.json`, and signing key are already cross-platform. Windows needs a code-signing certificate (~$200–400/yr, or Azure Trusted Signing) to avoid SmartScreen warnings; Linux needs none.
- **Small platform shims** — `open_notification_settings` and the dock/activation-policy code are macOS-only and need Windows/Linux equivalents or graceful no-ops. Notifications already have a non-macOS branch.

### Release hygiene
- Never leave a release in Draft. After every release, verify it is published with its assets (use the release-tauri skill).

## Documentation

- Logic changes must update any docs in `docs/` that describe the affected behavior.
- Plans must list the doc files that need updating as part of the work.
- Exclude design from docs, and keep them simple, less-technical, easy to skim.

## Guardrails

- Use `trash` for deletes
- Use `mv` / `cp` to move and copy files
- Bugs: add regression test when it fits
- Keep files <~500 LOC; split/refactor as needed
- Before writing code, strictly follow the below research rules

## IPC Types (specta)

Tauri IPC types are auto-generated from Rust to TypeScript via `tauri-specta`. Rust is the single source of truth — never hand-write TS types that mirror Rust IPC structs.

- **Generated file:** `src/bindings.ts` (do not edit by hand). Contains all command signatures, event types, and type definitions.
- **When you change a Rust IPC type or command:** add `#[derive(specta::Type)]` to new structs/enums, `#[specta::specta]` to new `#[tauri::command]` functions, and `#[derive(tauri_specta::Event)]` + `#[tauri_specta(event_name = "...")]` to new event types. Then register them in the `Builder::new().commands(...).events(...)` call in `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` `run()` (and in the `export_bindings` test in the same file).
- **Regenerate bindings:** `cd src-tauri && cargo test test_export_bindings`. The `run()` function also auto-exports on every debug-mode app launch (`npm run tauri dev`), so bindings stay in sync during development.
- **Frontend usage:** import types from `@/bindings` (e.g., `import type { MetricLine, PluginOutput } from "@/bindings"`). Re-export them through `src/lib/plugin-types.ts` if you need narrowed literal types. Keep using `invoke<T>("command_name", args)` and `listen<T>("event_name", handler)` — do not switch to the generated `commands.foo()` wrappers (they use a `typedError` pattern that would break existing try/catch blocks and test mocks).
- **specta forbids `u64`/`usize`/`i64`/`isize`** in IPC types (BigInt precision loss in JS). Use `f64` for timestamps, byte sizes, and counts that cross the IPC boundary — safe within JS's 2^53 safe integer range.
- **`Option<T>` becomes `T | null`** in generated TS (not `T | undefined`). Frontend code must handle `null`, not just `undefined`. Use `?? defaultValue` or null guards.

## Research

- Check for and prefer available skills over web research.
- Prefer researched knowledge over your own knowledge when skills are unavailable.
- Research: Exa to general search, Context7 for official docs, GitHits for open source examples
- Best results: Quote exact errors; prefer late-2025/2026+ sources.

## Error Handling

Always fail loudly into error logging (e.g., Sentry) and but show friendly errors to the user. Do not add silent fallbacks that hide real problems.

## UI

Always use titlecase any hardcoded copy for titles.

Strictly use `@hugeicons-pro/core-solid-rounded`. Nothing else. If you come across `lucide-react` or similar, replace it. Pattern: `<HugeiconsIcon icon={FooIcon} className="size-4" />`. Never pass `strokeWidth` (paints an unwanted outline on filled glyphs).

> Note: `@hugeicons-pro` is a paid package on a private registry (`npm.hugeicons.com`) requiring a Universal License Key in `.npmrc`. It is not set up in this repo yet, so `lucide-react` is used in the meantime. When a license is available, add `.npmrc` with `@hugeicons-pro:registry=https://npm.hugeicons.com/` and a token, install `@hugeicons/react` + `@hugeicons-pro/core-solid-rounded`, then migrate all `lucide-react` imports.

## Automated Testing

In some environments you may have `$TEST_EMAIL` and `$TEST_PASSWORD` available when you encounter a login request for the app.

## Agent Guidance

When you have enough information to act, act. Do not re-derive facts already established in the conversation, re-litigate a decision the user has already made, or narrate options you will not pursue in user-facing messages. If you are weighing a choice, give a recommendation, not an exhaustive survey. This does not apply to thinking blocks.

Don't add features, refactor, or introduce abstractions beyond what the task requires. A bug fix doesn't need surrounding cleanup and a one-shot operation usually doesn't need a helper. Don't design for hypothetical future requirements: do the simplest thing that works well. Avoid premature abstraction and half-finished implementations. Don't add error handling, fallbacks, or validation for scenarios that cannot happen. Trust
internal code and framework guarantees. Only validate at system boundaries (user input, external APIs). Don't use feature flags or backwards-compatibility shims when you can just change the code.

Lead with the outcome. Your first sentence after finishing should answer "what happened" or "what did you find": the thing the user would ask for if they said "just give me the TLDR." Supporting detail and reasoning come after. Being readable and being concise are different things, and readability matters more.

The way to keep output short is to be selective about what you include (drop details that don't change what the reader would do next), not to compress the writing into fragments, abbreviations, arrow chains like A → B → fails, or jargon.

Pause for the user only when the work genuinely requires them: a destructive or irreversible action, a real scope change, or input that only they can provide. If you hit one of these, ask and end the turn, rather than ending on a promise.

Before reporting progress, audit each claim against a tool result from this session. Only report work you can point to evidence for; if something is not yet verified, say so explicitly. Report outcomes faithfully: if tests fail, say so with the output; if a step was skipped, say that; when something is done and verified, state it plainly without hedging.

When the user is describing a problem, asking a question, or thinking out loud rather than requesting a change, the deliverable is your assessment. Report your findings and stop. Don't apply a fix until they ask for one. Before running a command that changes system state (restarts, deletes, config edits), check that the evidence actually supports that specific action. A signal that pattern-matches to a known failure may have
a different cause.

Delegate independent subtasks to subagents and keep working while they run. Intervene if a subagent goes off track or is missing relevant context.

Store one lesson per file with a one-line summary at the top. Record corrections and confirmed approaches alike, including why they mattered. Don't save what the repo or chat history already records; update an existing note rather than creating a duplicate; delete notes that turn out to be wrong.

You are operating autonomously. The user is not watching in real time and cannot answer questions mid-task, so asking "Want me to…?" or "Shall I…?" will block the work. For reversible actions that follow from the original request, proceed without asking. Offering follow-ups after the task is done is fine; asking permission after already discussing with the user before doing the work is not. Before ending your turn, check your last paragraph. If it is a plan, an analysis, a question, a list of next steps, or a promise about work you have not done ("I'll…", "let me know when…"), do that work now with tool calls. End your turn only when the task is complete or you are blocked on
input only the user can provide.

You have ample context remaining. Do not stop, summarize, or suggest a new session on account of context limits. Continue the work.

I'm working on [the larger task] for [who it's for]. They need [what the output enables]. With that in mind: [request].

Terse shorthand is fine between tool calls (that's you thinking out loud, and brevity there is good). Your final summary is different: it's for a reader who didn't see any of that.

If you've been working for a while without the user watching (overnight, across many tool calls, since they last spoke), your final message is their first look at any of it. Write it as a re-grounding, not a continuation of your working thread: the outcome first, then the one or two things you need from them, each explained as if new. The vocabulary you built up while working is yours, not theirs; leave it behind unless you re-introduce it.

When you write the summary at the end, skip the technical jargon. Write like you'd explain it to a non-engineer, without dumbing it down too much. Write complete sentences. When you mention files, commits, flags, or other identifiers, give each one its own plain-language clause. Open with the outcome: one sentence on what happened or what you found. Then the supporting detail. If you have to choose between short and clear, choose clear.

## Before Creating Pull Request

- Before creating a PR or pushing to main, ensure that `README.md` is updated with what plugins are supported.
- On any plugin change/new plugin, audit plugin-exposed request/response fields against `src-tauri/src/plugin_engine/host_api.rs` redaction lists and add/update tests for gaps. Compare with existing plugins for patterns.
- In `plugin.json`, set `brandColor` to the provider's real brand color.
- Plugin SVG logos must use `currentColor` so icon theming works correctly.
- If the PR includes visual changes, refuse to create it without providing before/after screenshots.

## Project Memories

Use below list to store and recall user notes when asked to do so.

- Use this list when asked to remember things. Keep each list item concise.
- Tauri IPC: JS must use camelCase (`{ batchId, pluginIds }`), Tauri auto-converts to Rust's snake_case. Never send snake_case from JS—params silently won't match. (Note: specta-generated `commands.foo()` wrappers handle this automatically, but we keep manual `invoke()` calls — see the IPC Types section above.)
- tauri-action `latest.json`: Parallel matrix builds are safe—action fetches existing `latest.json`, merges platform entries, re-uploads. No `max-parallel: 1` needed.
