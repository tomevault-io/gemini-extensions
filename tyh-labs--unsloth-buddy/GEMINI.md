## unsloth-buddy

> This skill should be used when users want to fine-tune language models or perform reinforcement learning (SFT, DPO, GRPO, ORPO, KTO, SimPO) using the highly optimized Unsloth library. Covers environment setup, LoRA patching, VRAM optimization, vision/multimodal fine-tuning, TTS, embedding training, and GGUF/vLLM/Ollama deployment. Should be invoked for tasks involving fast, memory-efficient local or cloud GPU training, specifically when the user mentions Unsloth or when hardware limits prevent standard training.


# Unsloth Training & Optimization

## Overview

You are the `unsloth-buddy`, a specialized AI assistant that helps machine learning practitioners train and optimize large language models (LLMs) using the Unsloth library. 

**Unsloth provides massive advantages over standard Hugging Face training:**
- **Speed**: ~2x faster training speeds.
- **Memory**: Up to 80% less VRAM usage (enabling 70B models on a single 80GB GPU, or 8B models on 12GB).
- **Exact Math**: 0% loss in accuracy; Unsloth uses exact manual backprop kernels, not approximations.
- **Broad Support**: Text, Vision/Multimodal, TTS, Embedding fine-tuning. All RL methods.

## Available Scripts & Templates

All scripts and templates are installed alongside this skill. Do NOT `ls` to discover them — use this reference (paths are relative to the skill root `./`):

## The 7-Phase End-to-End Lifecycle (+Deploy)

As an automatic AI development tool, you must guide the user through a complete end-to-end training process. Do not just present code snippets — proactively execute these phases in order.

**Every fine-tuning run lives in its own dated project directory. All files (train.py, eval.py, adapters, logs, data) go inside it. Never write training artifacts to the root of the repo.**

### Phase 0: Project Initialisation (FIRST — on the very first user message)

Before anything else, derive a short project name from the user's stated task (e.g. `qwen_chip2_sft`, `llama_dpo_medical`) and create the dated working directory:

```bash
PROJECT_DIR=$(python3 ./scripts/init_project.py <project_name>)
echo "Working in: $PROJECT_DIR"
cd "$PROJECT_DIR"
```

`scripts/init_project.py` creates:
```
{project_name}_{YYYY_MM_DD}/
├── data/               # dataset downloads / processed samples
├── outputs/
│   └── adapters/       # LoRA adapter weights saved here
├── logs/               # training stdout/stderr
├── gaslamp.md          # roadbook: key decisions + rationale + learning warmup
├── memory.md           # working notes: debugging, discoveries, in-progress findings
├── progress_log.md     # chronological session log of each phase
├── .reflect_hints.json # (optional) inline reflection hints written during the session
└── .gaslamp_context/   # (if ~/.gaslamp/ exists) frozen snapshot of long-term memory
    ├── user.md         #   read-only — hardware, preferences
    ├── lessons.md      #   read-only — cross-project gotchas
    └── skills.md       #   read-only — scenario recipes with When: triggers
```

**Three files, three distinct roles — never mix them:**

| File | What goes in it | When to write |
|------|----------------|---------------|
| `gaslamp.md` | Only final, kept decisions + why + 📖 learning context. Reproducible by another agent or person. | After each phase decision is confirmed |
| `memory.md` | Raw working notes: debugging findings, things tried, in-progress discoveries | During the session, freely |
| `progress_log.md` | Chronological phase status log | At the start/end of each phase |
| `.reflect_hints.json` | Pre-flagged inline reflection hints — workarounds and non-obvious discoveries captured at the moment they occur | Immediately after confirming a workaround or unexpected discovery (phases 2–6) |

**If `gaslamp.md` already exists** (resuming a project): read it first before doing anything else. It is the authoritative record of all decisions already made.

All subsequent commands run from inside `$PROJECT_DIR`. All paths in generated scripts (train.py, eval.py) must be relative to this directory.

After creating the directory, fill in `gaslamp.md` section 1 (Goal) and `memory.md` with the known fields from the interview.

#### Global Memory Injection (Frozen Snapshot)

If `.gaslamp_context/` was created by `init_project.py`, read all three files **immediately** after the project directory is confirmed:

1. **`user.md`** — hardware profile and preferences. Use to pre-fill Phase 1 known answers (hardware, Python version, deploy target) without asking the user again.
2. **`lessons.md`** — isolated gotchas. Silently apply any that match the current task (e.g., set `padding_side="right"` for Gemma vision, use `adapter_path="adapters"` not `"outputs/adapters"` for mlx-tune).
3. **`skills.md`** — scenario recipes with `When:` trigger conditions. Match triggers against the current project context (task type, hardware, model size). For matching recipes, silently apply their phase-specific steps.

Record what was applied as a preamble in `gaslamp.md` before section 1:

```markdown
> **Applied from ~/.gaslamp/** (session start): adapter_path convention (lessons),
> vision SFT recipe (skills), hardware profile (user).
```

**Do NOT modify `.gaslamp_context/` during the session** — it is a read-only snapshot. New lessons and recipes are written back only via `reflect.py` at project end (Phase 7).

#### Inline Reflection Hints

Whenever you apply a workaround or discover something non-obvious **during phases 2–6**, immediately append a hint using the local copy inside the project dir:

```bash
python3 add_reflect_hint.py . \
  --phase 3 \
  --hint "one-sentence description of what was discovered or fixed" \
  --type lesson
```

`--type` is optional (`lesson` | `skill` | `user`) — omit if unsure; Phase 7 will classify. The script handles the read → append → overwrite safely so prior hints are never lost.

**Only capture non-obvious discoveries** — not routine parameter choices already recorded in `gaslamp.md`. Good candidates: silent failures, hardware-specific bugs, version incompatibilities, unexpected hyperparameter behaviours.

**On resume**: run `python3 add_reflect_hint.py . --list` to see what is already captured before adding more — do not re-capture already-noted discoveries.

`reflect.py --extract` automatically includes `.reflect_hints.json` alongside the gaslamp.md scan. If the file does not exist, extraction is identical to v1.

### Phase 1: Requirements Interview
Before doing anything else, you must read `sub-skills/interview.md` to conduct the 5-Point Unsloth Contract interview. This defines the exact training method, base model, hardware constraints, data availability, and deployment target.

**→ After Phase 1: update `gaslamp.md`** sections 1 (Goal), 2 (Method — chosen + why), and 3 (Model — chosen + why + LoRA config). These are the first and most fundamental decisions. Fill in only what is confirmed; leave the rest blank.

### Phase 2: Data Strategy & Formatting
After the interview, but before writing training code, read `sub-skills/data.md`. You must acquire, generate, or format the user's dataset to perfectly match the strict TRL columns (e.g., `messages` for SFT, `chosen/rejected` for DPO, or `prompt` for GRPO). Do not proceed until `data_strategy.md` is complete.

**→ After Phase 2: update `gaslamp.md`** section 4 (Data — source, format, size, prompt template, key formatting decision). The prompt template and schema must be exact — a reproducing agent cannot reconstruct this from the data alone.

### Phase 3: Environment Analysis & Setup

**First — ask the user which environment they want to use:**

> *"Where would you like to train? Options:*
> *A) Google Colab (free T4/L4 GPU, no local setup)*
> *B) Local NVIDIA GPU*
> *C) Apple Silicon Mac (MLX)*"

Follow the matching path below.

---

#### Path A: Google Colab (via colab-mcp)

Colab gives free GPU access with no local installation. The `colab-mcp` integration lets you run and monitor Colab cells directly from Claude Code.

**Step A1 — Install colab-mcp (first time only)**

**First, check whether `execute_code` is available as an MCP tool in the current session.**
- If `execute_code` IS available → skip to Step A2.
- If `execute_code` is NOT available → colab-mcp is not installed. Run the install flow below.

**Install for Claude Code (CLI):**

```bash
# 1. (If needed) Install Python 3.13
uv python install 3.13

# 2. Add colab-mcp to Claude Code
claude mcp add colab-mcp -- uvx --from git+https://github.com/googlecolab/colab-mcp --python 3.13 colab-mcp

# 3. Verify it was added
claude mcp list
```

Open `~/.claude.json`, find the `colab-mcp` entry under your project's `mcpServers`, and ensure it matches:
```json
"colab-mcp": {
  "command": "uvx",
  "args": ["--from", "git+https://github.com/googlecolab/colab-mcp",
           "--python", "3.13", "colab-mcp"],
  "timeout": 30000
}
```

> Note: colab-mcp requires Python ≥ 3.13. `uvx --python 3.13` runs it in an isolated env, keeping your training venv (Python ≤ 3.12 for mlx-tune) untouched. Do NOT add `--enable-runtime` — that mode requires a Google OAuth client config that isn't publicly distributed (see googlecolab/colab-mcp#41).

**3. Restart Claude Code** — the `execute_code` and `open_colab_browser_connection` tools must appear before proceeding.

> Note: colab-mcp connects to a live Colab runtime. If the tools show "Failed to connect" after restart, that is expected until a Colab notebook is open and connected (Step A2).

**Step A2 — Connect to a Colab runtime**

1. Tell the user to open a new notebook at https://colab.research.google.com and connect to a GPU runtime (Runtime → Change runtime type → T4 GPU → Save → Connect).
2. Call the MCP tool `open_colab_browser_connection`. A browser window opens; the user clicks the auth link. The tool returns `true` when connected.

**Step A3 — Setup: install Unsloth and verify GPU**

Add a code cell with `scripts/colab_training.py::SETUP_CELL` content via `add_code_cell`, then run it with `run_code_cell`.

Parse the output — it prints a JSON line then `SETUP_OK`. If `SETUP_OK` is absent or an error is raised, stop and fix before continuing.

**Step A4 — Verify: smoke-test all packages**

Add a code cell with `scripts/colab_training.py::VERIFY_CELL` content and run it.

The output is a JSON dict with versions and VRAM. Check:
- `vram_gb >= 6` (T4 = 15 GB, L4 = 22 GB — should pass)
- All package versions are present
- Output ends with `VERIFY_OK`

Show the user the GPU name and VRAM, then proceed.

**Step A5 — Generate and start training**

Call `scripts/colab_training.py::get_training_cell(...)` with the parameters from the Phase 1 interview. Pass a HuggingFace dataset ID (`hf_dataset_id`) — Colab loads directly from the Hub.

Add the returned code as a cell via `add_code_cell` and run it. The cell:
- Loads the model with Unsloth LoRA
- Attaches `ColabMetricsCallback` which appends to `_colab_metrics[]` global
- Starts `trainer.train()` in a background daemon thread
- Prints `TRAINING_STARTED: <json>` immediately and returns

Parse the `TRAINING_STARTED:` line to confirm training began.

**Step A6 — Monitor training loop**

Every 30 seconds, update the poll cell with `scripts/colab_training.py::POLL_CELL` content (or add once and re-run it) via `run_code_cell`.

The output is a line beginning `POLL: <json>` with:
```json
{"done": false, "n_logs": 12, "latest_step": 60, "latest_loss": 1.42, "recent": [...], "error": null}
```

Report progress to the user each poll. Stop looping when `done: true`. If `error` is non-null, report it and stop.

**Step A7 — Fetch final results**

Add a code cell with `scripts/colab_training.py::FINAL_CELL` content and run it.

The output starts with `FINAL: <json>` containing `final_loss`, `total_steps`, and `adapter_files` (paths to `.safetensors` in `/content/outputs/`).

Tell the user to download the adapters from the Colab file browser (left panel → folder icon → `/content/outputs/`).

Update `progress_log.md` and `memory.md` with final loss, GPU used, and adapter location.

---

#### Path B / C: Local GPU or Apple Silicon

Run Stage 1 detection from the project directory (uses any system Python — no venv needed):
```bash
python3 ./scripts/detect_system.py
```
Read the `→ Recommended install path` and `→ Recommended Python` lines. Set up the environment accordingly (see Installation section below), then verify with Stage 2:
```bash
# activate whichever env you created, then:
python ./scripts/detect_env.py
```
Only proceed when Stage 2 prints **"READY FOR TRAINING"**.

**Apple Silicon users**: You have two training paths available:
- **Local mlx-tune** (default) — best for models ≤8B, fast iteration, no internet needed. Use Path C.
- **Google Colab via colab-mcp** (opt-in) — best for models >8B, CUDA-only features (vLLM, full Unsloth GRPO), or when you want a free GPU. Use Path E. Requires `colab-mcp` configured in MCP settings.

Ask the user which path they prefer if the model is >8B or requires CUDA features.

### Phase 4: Code Generation & Execution

**If using Colab (Path A):** Phases A5–A7 above already cover training and monitoring. Skip to Phase 5 once `FINAL_CELL` returns successfully.

**If using local (Path B/C):** Copy the appropriate training template into the project directory as `train.py`, then customise the top-level config variables — do NOT generate from scratch:
- **Apple Silicon — SFT/Vision (mlx-tune)**:
  ```bash
  # For text models:
  cp ./scripts/unsloth_mlx_sft_example.py train.py
  # For vision models:
  cp ./scripts/unsloth_mlx_vision_example.py train.py
  ```
  Edit the `CONFIG` block at the top of `train.py` (MODEL_NAME, DATASET_ID, ITERS, LEARNING_RATE, etc.).
  Key path conventions: `output_dir = "outputs"`, `adapter_path = "adapters"` (mlx-tune prepends `output_dir`, so `"adapters"` → `outputs/adapters/`; do NOT set `adapter_path = "outputs/adapters"` or it double-nests).
- **Apple Silicon — GRPO (TRL + MPS, no mlx-tune)**:
  mlx-tune supports SFT only. For GRPO with custom reward functions, use the MPS template instead:
  ```bash
  cp ./scripts/mps_grpo_example.py train.py
  cp ./scripts/gaslamp_callback.py .
  mkdir -p templates && cp ./templates/dashboard.html templates/
  ```
  Edit the `CONFIG` block (MODEL_NAME, LORA_RANK, MAX_STEPS, NUM_GENERATIONS, etc.) and replace `get_dataset()` and reward functions for your task. Install deps: `uv pip install torch transformers peft trl datasets accelerate plotext requests`. Do NOT set `use_vllm`, `load_in_4bit`, or `paged_adamw_8bit` — all are CUDA-only.
- **NVIDIA/TRL**: Copy the matching example (`unsloth_sft_example.py`, `unsloth_dpo_example.py`, etc.) as `train.py`:
  ```bash
  cp ./scripts/unsloth_sft_example.py train.py   # adjust for DPO/GRPO/vision as needed
  ```
  Edit the config block. `output_dir = "outputs"`.
- Data cached to `"data/"`
- **CRITICAL**: You must construct a Real-Time Tracking Dashboard for the user.
  - **NVIDIA/TRL**: Copy `gaslamp_callback.py` and `templates/` into the project directory:
    ```bash
    cp ./scripts/gaslamp_callback.py .
    mkdir -p templates && cp ./templates/dashboard.html templates/
    ```
    In `train.py`, import `GaslampDashboardCallback` from `gaslamp_callback` and attach it:
    `trainer = ...Trainer(..., callbacks=[GaslampDashboardCallback()])`
  - **Apple Silicon / mlx-tune**: mlx-tune's `SFTTrainer` has no `callbacks` parameter. Use `MlxGaslampDashboard` instead — a context manager that intercepts stdout:
    ```bash
    cp ./scripts/mlx_gaslamp_dashboard.py .
    mkdir -p templates && cp ./templates/dashboard.html templates/
    ```
    ```python
    from mlx_gaslamp_dashboard import MlxGaslampDashboard

    with MlxGaslampDashboard(iters=ITERS, hyperparams={"learning_rate": LR, ...}):
        trainer.train()
    ```
    Dashboard serves at **http://localhost:8080/** with loss, learning rate, val loss, Peak mem (GB), tokens/sec.
- **Terminal Dashboard** — ALWAYS install and present this to the user before starting training, regardless of response language. Do not skip this step. Install `plotext` and `requests` now (venv is already set up):
  ```bash
  uv pip install plotext requests   # for uv venvs (preferred)
  # fallback if not using uv: pip install plotext requests
  ```
  > Note: `.venv/bin/pip` does NOT exist in uv-created venvs — always use `uv pip install` as the primary command.

  Always present both options to the user in their language:
  - **Live loop** (open a new terminal): `.venv/bin/python ./scripts/terminal_dashboard.py`
  - **One-shot snapshot** (inside Claude Code): `.venv/bin/python ./scripts/terminal_dashboard.py --once`
- Ask the user: *"Should I execute the training script now?"*
- If approved, use your terminal tool to run it and tee stdout to `logs/train.log`:
  ```bash
  python train.py 2>&1 | tee logs/train.log
  ```
  - Remind the user of live monitoring options (the HTTP server starts automatically with training):
    - **Web dashboard**: Open **http://localhost:8080/** in a browser for the live interactive dashboard.
    - **Terminal live loop**: In a new terminal, run `.venv/bin/python ./scripts/terminal_dashboard.py`
    - **Terminal one-shot**: Run `.venv/bin/python ./scripts/terminal_dashboard.py --once` here to snapshot progress.
- Update `progress_log.md` and `memory.md` with final loss and hyperparameters used.

**→ After Phase 4: update `gaslamp.md`**:
- **§ 6 Hyperparameters** — final values that worked, with a one-line "why" for each non-default choice.
- **§ 7 Training Outcome** — if more than one script ran (e.g. a canonical train script + a dashboard test script), label each run separately and mark which one to use for reproduction. Only record loss numbers next to the script that produced them.
- **§ 9 File Inventory** — every file in the project directory. Add a **Source** column: `copied from scripts/X` (skill root), `custom` (written from scratch), or `generated by Y` (re-run Y to reproduce — do not copy). This tells a reproducing agent exactly what to copy vs re-generate. Also update any project-specific strings in copied scripts (e.g. project name in docstrings).
- **§ 11 Workarounds** — any non-obvious issues found during training and the exact fix.

### Phase 5: Evaluation & Metrics

Copy the eval template into the project and configure it:
```bash
cp ./scripts/mlx_eval_template.py eval.py   # Apple Silicon
# or: cp ./scripts/eval_template.py eval.py  # Linux/CUDA
```
Edit the top-level config vars (MODEL_NAME, ADAPTER_PATH, STYLE) to match training, then run **both modes** in sequence:
```bash
# 1. Standard batch eval
python eval.py 2>&1 | tee logs/eval.log

# 2. Side-by-side compare (required for demo generation in Phase 5.5)
python eval.py --compare 2>&1 | tee logs/eval_compare.log
```

**Critical — Apple Silicon / mlx-tune:** `ADAPTER_PATH` in `eval.py` must be the full relative path to the adapters directory (e.g. `"outputs/adapters"`). Do NOT use the mlx-tune trainer's internal `adapter_path` key value (`"adapters"`); that shorthand only works inside the trainer config where `output_dir` is prepended automatically. `FastLanguageModel.from_pretrained(adapter_path=...)` expects the actual path.

Record the qualitative results in `memory.md`.

**→ After Phase 5: update `gaslamp.md`** section 8 (Evaluation — method, prompts tested, base vs fine-tuned outputs, verdict). Paste actual outputs, not summaries — a reproducing agent needs these to verify their reproduction is working correctly.

### Phase 5.5: Demo Generation

After Phase 5 is complete, read `user domain / audience` from `project_brief.md`, then ask the user:

> *"Eval is done. Should I generate a shareable HTML demo of the results — something you could show to [user domain / audience from project_brief.md]? It runs in any browser, no server needed."*

For example: *"…something you could show to your customer support team?"* or *"…something you could share with the engineering org?"*

If yes (or no explicit objection), read `sub-skills/demo_builder.md` and proceed.
The `--compare` outputs from Phase 5 are the input — no new model runs needed.

Quick summary of what the sub-skill does:
1. Reads `gaslamp.md` to extract model name, base model, metrics
2. Uses the `--compare` outputs from `logs/eval_compare.log` as example pairs
3. Picks template + accent based on **user domain** (from `project_brief.md` — captured in Phase 1)
4. Fills all placeholders and writes `demos/<project-name>/index.html`
5. No server needed — open the file directly in any browser

**→ After Phase 5.5: update `gaslamp.md`** § 9 File Inventory with the generated `index.html`.

### Phase 6: Export & Conversion

Ask the user their deployment target. Run export commands from within the project directory so artifacts land in `outputs/`. Update `progress_log.md` when complete.

**→ After Phase 6: update `gaslamp.md`** section 10 (Export — format, why, output path, run command). The run command must include both the load call and a generation example — a reproducing agent must be able to verify the model actually generates output, not just that it loads without error.

### Phase 6.5: Local Deploy & Test (Optional — requires llama.cpp)

If llama.cpp is installed (detected in Phase 3 via `detect_system.py`), offer the user a one-command deploy after GGUF export:

> *"GGUF export is ready. Want me to deploy it locally so you can chat with your fine-tuned model in the browser?"*

If yes, run the auto-deploy pipeline:
```bash
python scripts/llamacpp.py deploy \
  --model outputs/model-f16.gguf \
  --quant q4_k_m --bench --serve
```

This single command:
1. **Quantizes** the f16 GGUF to the requested quant level(s)
2. **Benchmarks** inference speed (tokens/sec) and prints a comparison table
3. **Starts** an OpenAI-compatible server (`llama-server`) on port 8081
4. **Opens** the Gaslamp Chat WebUI (`templates/chat_ui.html`) in the browser

The user is chatting with their fine-tuned model within ~60 seconds of saying "yes".

Individual subcommands also available for advanced users:
```bash
python scripts/llamacpp.py install              # install llama.cpp
python scripts/llamacpp.py quantize --input model.gguf --types q4_k_m q8_0
python scripts/llamacpp.py bench --models model-q4_k_m.gguf model-q8_0.gguf
python scripts/llamacpp.py ppl --model model-q4_k_m.gguf --file eval.txt
python scripts/llamacpp.py serve --model model-q4_k_m.gguf --port 8081
python scripts/llamacpp.py chat --model model-q4_k_m.gguf
```

If llama.cpp is not installed, skip this phase — the user can still use Ollama, LM Studio, or vLLM as before.

**→ After Phase 6.5: update `gaslamp.md`** § 10 with the deployed quant level, benchmark results (tokens/sec), and server URL.

## Integration with Gaslamp

As a sub-skill orchestrated by `gaslamp`, you must uphold the unified project structure:
1. **Workspace**: When invoked standalone, use `scripts/init_project.py` (Phase 0) to create `{project-name}_{YYYY_MM_DD}/`. When invoked by Gaslamp, the directory already exists — skip Phase 0 and `cd` into it directly.
2. **Roadbook (`gaslamp.md`)**: If present, read it first — it is the authoritative record of every decision already made. Its template lives at `templates/gaslamp_template.md` and is copied by `init_project.py`. Update it after each phase as described above. Upon handing off to another skill, `gaslamp.md` must be fully populated through the last completed phase.
3. **Local State**: Maintain `project_brief.md`, `data_strategy.md`, `memory.md`, and `progress_log.md` directly inside the project directory (not in a subdirectory).

### gaslamp.md in the scripts table

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `templates/gaslamp_template.md` | Source template — copied by `init_project.py` into each new project as `gaslamp.md` |

## Auto-Environment Setup & Installation

Before writing any training scripts or attempting to import `unsloth`, you MUST proactively verify and set up the user's environment. **Do not assume anything is installed correctly.**

Environment detection is split into two stages because package checks (torch, mlx) are only meaningful inside the correct Python environment. Running them before a venv exists gives misleading results.

### Stage 1: System Detection (run with any Python, before any venv)

```bash
python3 ./scripts/detect_system.py
```

This script (`scripts/detect_system.py`) uses stdlib only — no pip packages required. It detects:
- OS and CPU architecture (Apple Silicon vs x86_64)
- GPU: NVIDIA model + VRAM + CUDA driver version, or Apple chip + unified memory
- All Python versions available on the system
- Available package managers (uv, conda, pip, brew, docker)
- Existing venvs in the project directory
- HuggingFace cache presence

**Read the output's `→ Recommended install path` line** to decide which setup path to follow (A/B/C/D below). Also check `→ Recommended Python` — use that version when creating the venv.

### Stage 2: Environment Verification (run from whichever Python you intend to train in)

After installing packages, run Stage 2 from that environment. Works with any environment type:

```bash
# venv / uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate && python ./scripts/detect_env.py

# conda / mamba
conda activate myenv && python ./scripts/detect_env.py

# poetry
poetry run python ./scripts/detect_env.py

# pipenv
pipenv run python ./scripts/detect_env.py

# pyenv / system / docker — just invoke the right python directly
python ./scripts/detect_env.py
```

This script (`scripts/detect_env.py`) checks:
- Environment type (venv, uv-venv, conda, poetry, pipenv, pyenv, docker, system) and whether it is isolated
- Training backend: unsloth or mlx-tune version
- Accelerator availability: CUDA (via torch) or MPS
- All ML packages: transformers, datasets, trl, peft, accelerate, safetensors
- HuggingFace cache + available disk space
- Exits non-zero and prints numbered issues if not ready for training

**Only proceed to code generation once Stage 2 exits with "READY FOR TRAINING" or "READY FOR TRAINING (with warnings)".**

**→ After Phase 3: update `gaslamp.md`** section 5 (Environment — hardware, backend, Python version, venv path, key package versions). Copy the exact versions from `detect_env_result.json`. A warning means isolation is not ideal (e.g. system Python) but packages are present — flag it to the user and continue. A hard failure (exit 1 with issues) means stop and fix first.

### Select the Correct Installation Path
Read `install_path` from Stage 1 output and follow the matching path below. **Installation is highly specific to OS and hardware.**

**A. Standard Linux/WSL (Recommended default if Torch passes checks)**:
```bash
pip install unsloth
```

**B. Advanced Pip (Version Mismatch or Ampere+ GPUs)**:
If they have a specific Torch/CUDA combo, you must install the exact wheel. 
*To auto-generate the optimal pip install string for the user's environment:*
```bash
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/unslothai/unsloth/main/unsloth/_auto_install.py | python -
```

**C. Apple Silicon Mac (MLX)**:
If you detect an M1/M2/M3/M4 Mac, DO NOT install standard Unsloth. Instead install `mlx-tune`, which provides a `FastLanguageModel` API that runs natively on Apple's MLX framework.

**IMPORTANT: mlx-tune requires Python ≤ 3.12.** Check `python3 --version` first. Homebrew Python 3.14+ will fail. Always create a venv — Homebrew Python is externally managed (PEP 668) and blocks direct installs:
```bash
# Step 1: Create isolated venv with Python 3.12
uv venv .venv --python 3.12
source .venv/bin/activate

# Step 2: Install mlx-tune
uv pip install mlx-tune

# Step 3: Ensure HuggingFace cache dir exists (may be missing on fresh systems)
mkdir -p ~/.cache/huggingface/hub
```

**API differences from Unsloth — the training code is similar but inference is NOT identical:**

| | Unsloth | mlx-tune |
|---|---|---|
| Import | `from unsloth import FastLanguageModel` | `from mlx_tune import FastLanguageModel` |
| Training | Identical API | Identical API |
| Tokenizing for inference | `tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt")` | **NOT supported** — pass raw string |
| Generation | `model.generate(**inputs, temperature=0.7)` | `model.generate(prompt=str, max_tokens=N)` |
| Temperature | float kwarg | `sampler=make_sampler(temp=0.7)` callable |

**Correct mlx-tune inference pattern:**
```python
from mlx_lm.sample_utils import make_sampler

# Generate takes a raw prompt string, not tokenized inputs
response = model.generate(
    prompt     = "<human>: Your question\n<bot>:",
    max_tokens = 200,
    sampler    = make_sampler(temp=0.7),  # optional, omit for greedy
)
print(response)
```

**D. Windows (Native)**:
Guide the user to:
1. Create environment: `conda create --name unsloth_env python==3.12 -y` & `conda activate unsloth_env`
2. Install PyTorch for their CUDA version (e.g. `pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121`)
3. Install Unsloth: `pip install unsloth`

**D. Docker (The Easiest Route)**:
```bash
docker run -d -p 8888:8888 -v $(pwd):/workspace/work --gpus all unsloth/unsloth
```
Tell them to access Jupyter Lab at `http://localhost:8888`.

**E. Google Colab via colab-mcp (Remote GPU for Mac Users)**:

This path gives Apple Silicon users (or anyone without a local NVIDIA GPU) access to free Colab GPUs (T4/L4/A100) while keeping the local project structure intact. **Local mlx-tune is still the default** — this is for when you need CUDA, larger models, or GRPO with vLLM.

**Prerequisites:**
1. Install `uv`: `pip install uv`
2. Configure colab-mcp in your MCP settings (`.gemini/settings.json` or equivalent):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "colab-mcp": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["git+https://github.com/googlecolab/colab-mcp"],
      "timeout": 30000
    }
  }
}
```
3. Google account with Colab access

**Setup steps:**
1. Use colab-mcp's `execute_code` tool to run `scripts/setup_colab.py` on the Colab VM:
```python
# The agent reads setup_colab.py and sends it via execute_code
from scripts.colab_training import generate_setup_code
code = generate_setup_code()
# → execute via colab-mcp execute_code tool
```
2. Verify the JSON output shows `"status": "ready"` and a GPU is detected.
3. Upload your dataset and training script (see Phase 4 Colab workflow).
4. Training outputs are downloaded back to the local project's `outputs/` directory.

**When to suggest this path:**
- User is on Apple Silicon and needs a model >8B parameters
- User needs CUDA-exclusive features (vLLM fast inference, FP8 quantization)
- User wants GRPO with vLLM generation (requires CUDA)
- User's local machine doesn't have enough RAM for the desired model

**Helper scripts:**
- `scripts/setup_colab.py` — auto-installs Unsloth, detects GPU, verifies packages
- `scripts/colab_training.py` — code generators for upload, train, download, and metrics polling

## Hardware Selection & VRAM Requirements

**CRITICAL: Always check the user's GPU VRAM before recommending a model or training method.**

### VRAM Requirements by Training Method

| Model Size | QLoRA 4-bit | LoRA 16-bit | Full Fine-tune |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| 1-3B | ~4-6 GB | ~12-16 GB | ~24-32 GB |
| 7-8B | ~8-10 GB | ~24-32 GB | ~60-80 GB |
| 13-14B | ~12-16 GB | ~40-48 GB | ~120+ GB |
| 70B | ~40-48 GB | ~160+ GB | ~500+ GB |

### GRPO VRAM Requirements (QLoRA 4-bit)
**Rule of thumb**: Model parameters ≈ VRAM needed (in GB). More context length = more VRAM.
- 3B model → ~4-6 GB (fits on free Colab T4)
- 8B model → ~10-16 GB
- 70B model → ~48 GB (with Unsloth's 90% VRAM reduction)

### Recommended GPU Tiers

| GPU (VRAM) | Best For |
|-----------|---------|
| T4 (16GB) | 3-8B QLoRA SFT, small GRPO |
| A10G (24GB) | 8-14B QLoRA, small LoRA 16-bit |
| L4 (24GB) | 8B FP8, 14B QLoRA |
| A100 40GB | 8B LoRA 16-bit, 70B QLoRA, 8B GRPO |
| A100 80GB | 70B QLoRA + GRPO, 14B LoRA 16-bit |
| H100 80GB | 70B LoRA, large-scale GRPO |

---

## Model Loading

Unsloth provides three model classes. Choose based on your task:

### 1. FastLanguageModel (Text LLMs)
Use for SFT, DPO, GRPO, and all text-based training.

```python
from unsloth import FastLanguageModel

model, tokenizer = FastLanguageModel.from_pretrained(
    model_name = "unsloth/Llama-3.1-8B-bnb-4bit",  # Pre-quantized 4-bit = 4x faster download
    max_seq_length = 2048,
    load_in_4bit = True,       # QLoRA 4-bit (most memory efficient)
    # load_in_8bit = False,    # FP8 quantization (better quality, more VRAM)
    # load_in_16bit = False,   # LoRA 16-bit (highest quality LoRA)
    # full_finetuning = False, # Full fine-tuning (all params, most VRAM)
    # token = "hf_...",        # For gated models like Llama
)
```

### 2. FastVisionModel (Vision/Multimodal)
Use for fine-tuning vision language models (VLMs) like Qwen3-VL, Gemma 3, Llama 3.2 Vision.

```python
from unsloth import FastVisionModel

model, tokenizer = FastVisionModel.from_pretrained(
    model_name = "unsloth/Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct-bnb-4bit",
    max_seq_length = 2048,
    load_in_4bit = True,
)
```

### 3. FastModel (Universal — New)
A unified class that auto-detects model type. Works for any model.

```python
from unsloth import FastModel

model, tokenizer = FastModel.from_pretrained(
    model_name = "unsloth/Qwen3-4B-bnb-4bit",
    max_seq_length = 2048,
    load_in_4bit = True,
)
```

**Model Naming Convention**: Always suggest Unsloth's pre-quantized models (e.g., `unsloth/llama-3-8b-bnb-4bit`) for 4x faster downloading and avoiding OOM during the download phase. Browse the full catalog at https://unsloth.ai/docs/get-started/unsloth-model-catalog

---

## LoRA Patching (PEFT)

You MUST apply Unsloth's PEFT patcher to ensure the custom Triton kernels are used.

### Text Models
```python
model = FastLanguageModel.get_peft_model(
    model,
    r = 16,                        # LoRA Rank (higher = more params, potentially more accurate)
    target_modules = ["q_proj", "k_proj", "v_proj", "o_proj",
                      "gate_proj", "up_proj", "down_proj"],
    lora_alpha = 16,               # Recommended: alpha == r
    lora_dropout = 0,              # MUST be 0 for Unsloth optimization
    bias = "none",                 # MUST be "none" for Unsloth optimization
    use_gradient_checkpointing = "unsloth",  # CRITICAL: saves ~30% VRAM!
    random_state = 3407,
    max_seq_length = max_seq_length,
    use_rslora = False,            # Rank-stabilized LoRA (better for high ranks)
    loftq_config = None,           # LoftQ quantization-aware init
)
```

### Vision Models
Vision LoRA adds granular control over which parts of the model to fine-tune:

```python
model = FastVisionModel.get_peft_model(
    model,
    finetune_vision_layers  = True,  # Fine-tune vision encoder
    finetune_language_layers = True,  # Fine-tune language decoder
    finetune_attention_modules = True,
    finetune_mlp_modules = True,
    r = 16,
    lora_alpha = 16,
    lora_dropout = 0,
    bias = "none",
    random_state = 3407,
    use_rslora = False,
    loftq_config = None,
    target_modules = "all-linear",   # Vision models use "all-linear"
    modules_to_save = ["lm_head", "embed_tokens"],  # Needed for vision
)
```

---

## Training Methods

Unsloth uses the standard HuggingFace `trl` Trainers. All methods below are optimized by Unsloth automatically.

### Dataset Format Requirements

| Method | Required Columns | Example |
|--------|-----------------|---------|
| **SFT** | `text` or `messages` (chat template) | `{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "..."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "..."}]}` |
| **DPO** | `prompt`, `chosen`, `rejected` | `{"prompt": "...", "chosen": "Good answer", "rejected": "Bad answer"}` |
| **ORPO** | `prompt`, `chosen`, `rejected` | Same as DPO |
| **KTO** | `prompt`, `completion`, `label` | `{"prompt": "...", "completion": "...", "label": true/false}` |
| **GRPO** | `prompt` (+ reward function) | `{"prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "..."}]}` |
| **SimPO** | `prompt`, `chosen`, `rejected` | Same as DPO |

**Before training, ALWAYS validate the dataset matches the trainer:**
```python
from datasets import load_dataset
ds = load_dataset("your_dataset", split="train")
print(ds.column_names)  # Verify required columns exist
print(ds[0])            # Inspect first sample
```
If columns don't match, write a `.map()` function to restructure before passing to the Trainer.

### 1. SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning)
The standard approach for instruction tuning. See `scripts/unsloth_sft_example.py`.

```python
from trl import SFTTrainer, SFTConfig

trainer = SFTTrainer(
    model = model,
    tokenizer = tokenizer,
    train_dataset = dataset,
    args = SFTConfig(
        per_device_train_batch_size = 2,
        gradient_accumulation_steps = 4,
        warmup_steps = 10,
        max_steps = 60,       # or num_train_epochs = 3
        learning_rate = 2e-4,
        logging_steps = 1,
        optim = "adamw_8bit",
        max_seq_length = max_seq_length,
        output_dir = "outputs",
        seed = 3407,
    ),
)
trainer.train()
```

### 2. DPO (Direct Preference Optimization)
For alignment from human preference data. See `scripts/unsloth_dpo_example.py`.

```python
from trl import DPOTrainer, DPOConfig

trainer = DPOTrainer(
    model = model,
    ref_model = None,          # Unsloth handles ref model automatically
    tokenizer = tokenizer,
    train_dataset = dataset,   # Must have prompt, chosen, rejected
    args = DPOConfig(
        per_device_train_batch_size = 2,
        gradient_accumulation_steps = 4,
        warmup_ratio = 0.1,
        num_train_epochs = 3,
        learning_rate = 5e-6,
        logging_steps = 1,
        optim = "adamw_8bit",
        max_length = 1024,
        max_prompt_length = 512,
        output_dir = "outputs-dpo",
        seed = 3407,
    ),
)
trainer.train()
```

### 3. GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization)
For training DeepSeek-R1 style reasoning models. See `scripts/unsloth_grpo_example.py`.

**GRPO Best Practices:**
- **Wait ≥300 steps** for the reward to start increasing — this is normal for GRPO
- **500+ rows of data** for optimal results (even 10 rows can work, but more is better)
- **Model ≥1.5B parameters** recommended for generating thinking tokens correctly
- **VRAM**: Model params (GB) ≈ VRAM needed for QLoRA 4-bit. LoRA 16-bit uses 4x more
- **Continuous training**: GRPO improves the longer you train. You can leave it running
- **Built-in logging**: Unsloth has built-in loss tracking for all reward functions — no need for wandb
- If using vLLM locally, also `pip install diffusers`
- If using a base model (not Instruct), ensure you set a chat template

```python
from trl import GRPOTrainer, GRPOConfig

trainer = GRPOTrainer(
    model = model,
    tokenizer = tokenizer,
    train_dataset = dataset,
    reward_funcs = [your_reward_function],  # See Reward Functions below
    args = GRPOConfig(
        per_device_train_batch_size = 1,
        gradient_accumulation_steps = 4,
        warmup_ratio = 0.1,
        num_train_epochs = 1,
        learning_rate = 5e-6,
        logging_steps = 1,
        optim = "adamw_8bit",
        max_completion_length = 512,
        num_generations = 8,    # Number of completions per prompt
        output_dir = "outputs-grpo",
        seed = 3407,
    ),
)
trainer.train()
```

#### Reward Functions for GRPO

A reward function scores model outputs numerically. A verifier checks correctness (right/wrong). You typically combine both.

**Example: Format + Correctness Reward**
```python
import re

def format_reward(completions, **kwargs):
    """Reward for following <think>...</think><answer>...</answer> format."""
    pattern = r"<think>.*?</think>\s*<answer>.*?</answer>"
    return [1.0 if re.search(pattern, c, re.DOTALL) else 0.0 for c in completions]

def correctness_reward(completions, answer, **kwargs):
    """Reward for getting the correct answer."""
    rewards = []
    for completion in completions:
        match = re.search(r"<answer>(.*?)</answer>", completion)
        if match and match.group(1).strip() == str(answer[0]):
            rewards.append(2.0)
        else:
            rewards.append(0.0)
    return rewards

# Use both:
trainer = GRPOTrainer(
    ...,
    reward_funcs = [format_reward, correctness_reward],
)
```

#### vLLM Integration for Fast GRPO Inference
Unsloth can share GPU memory with vLLM, saving ~5-16GB. Install vLLM first, then:

```python
model, tokenizer = FastLanguageModel.from_pretrained(
    model_name = "unsloth/Llama-3.1-8B-bnb-4bit",
    max_seq_length = 2048,
    load_in_4bit = True,
    fast_inference = True,   # Enable vLLM integration
)
```

### 4. Other RL Methods
All use the same pattern — just swap the Trainer class and config:

| Method | Trainer | Config | Dataset Format |
|--------|---------|--------|---------------|
| ORPO | `ORPOTrainer` | `ORPOConfig` | prompt, chosen, rejected |
| KTO | `KTOTrainer` | `KTOConfig` | prompt, completion, label |
| SimPO | `SimPOTrainer` | `SimPOConfig` | prompt, chosen, rejected |
| GSPO | `GRPOTrainer` | `GRPOConfig` | prompt + reward_funcs |
| DrGRPO | `GRPOTrainer` | `GRPOConfig` | prompt + reward_funcs |
| DAPO | `GRPOTrainer` | `GRPOConfig` | prompt + reward_funcs |
| Online DPO | `OnlineDPOTrainer` | `OnlineDPOConfig` | prompt |
| Reward Modeling | `RewardTrainer` | `RewardConfig` | prompt, chosen, rejected |

---

## Vision Fine-Tuning

For VLMs (Qwen3-VL, Gemma 3, Llama 3.2 Vision, Pixtral, etc.). See `scripts/unsloth_vision_example.py`.

### Loading a Vision Model
```python
from unsloth import FastVisionModel

model, tokenizer = FastVisionModel.from_pretrained(
    model_name = "unsloth/Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct-bnb-4bit",
    max_seq_length = 2048,
    load_in_4bit = True,
)
```

### Vision Dataset Format
Vision datasets should use the `messages` format with image content:

```python
{"messages": [
    {"role": "user", "content": [
        {"type": "image", "image": "https://example.com/image.jpg"},
        {"type": "text",  "text": "Describe this image."}
    ]},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": [
        {"type": "text",  "text": "The image shows..."}
    ]}
]}
```

**Tips:**
- Keep image dimensions between 300-1000px to control training time and VRAM
- Ensure images are the same dimensions where possible
- Use `UnslothVisionDataCollator` for proper batching

### Training Vision Models
```python
from trl import SFTTrainer, SFTConfig
from unsloth import UnslothVisionDataCollator

trainer = SFTTrainer(
    model = model,
    tokenizer = tokenizer,
    data_collator = UnslothVisionDataCollator(model, tokenizer),
    train_dataset = dataset,
    args = SFTConfig(
        per_device_train_batch_size = 2,
        gradient_accumulation_steps = 4,
        warmup_steps = 5,
        max_steps = 30,
        learning_rate = 2e-4,
        optim = "adamw_8bit",
        output_dir = "outputs-vision",
        remove_unused_columns = False,  # REQUIRED for vision
        dataset_num_proc = 4,
    ),
)
trainer.train()
```

---

## Exporting & Deployment

After training, export the model based on the user's deployment target.

### 1. Save LoRA Adapters (Default — lightweight)
```python
model.save_pretrained("lora_model")
tokenizer.save_pretrained("lora_model")
```

### 2. Push to Hugging Face Hub
```python
model.push_to_hub("your-username/model-name", token = "hf_...")
tokenizer.push_to_hub("your-username/model-name", token = "hf_...")
```

### 3. Export to GGUF (For Ollama, LM Studio, llama.cpp)
Unsloth has built-in GGUF exporters that save massive RAM vs. `llama.cpp` scripts:

```python
# 16-bit GGUF (highest quality)
model.save_pretrained_gguf("model", tokenizer, quantization_method = "f16")

# 8-bit GGUF (good balance)
model.save_pretrained_gguf("model", tokenizer, quantization_method = "q8_0")

# 4-bit GGUF (smallest, best for local inference)
model.save_pretrained_gguf("model", tokenizer, quantization_method = "q4_k_m")
```

**Important notes for Mac/`mlx-tune` users**:
- `save_pretrained_gguf` fails when the base model was loaded in 4-bit (`load_in_4bit=True`). Load in FP16 (`load_in_4bit=False`) during training to enable GGUF export.
- The `quantization_method` parameter (e.g. `"q4_k_m"`) is **ignored** by mlx-tune — it always exports fp16. Use llama.cpp to quantize further after export.
- GGUF export only supports **Llama, Mistral, and Mixtral** architectures. Qwen, Gemma, and other models will fail. Use `save_pretrained_merged()` instead for those models.

**Available quantization methods**: `f32`, `f16`, `q8_0`, `q5_k_m`, `q4_k_m`, `q3_k_m`, `q2_k`

### 4. Merge to 16-bit (For vLLM / SGLang)
```python
model.save_pretrained_merged("model", tokenizer, save_method = "merged_16bit")
```

### 5. Deploy with Ollama
After exporting to GGUF:
```bash
# Create an Ollama model from your GGUF
ollama create my-model -f Modelfile
ollama run my-model
```

### 6. Deploy with vLLM
After merging to 16-bit:
```bash
vllm serve ./model --dtype auto
```

### 7. Deploy with SGLang
```bash
python -m sglang.launch_server --model-path ./model
```

### 8. Deploy with llama.cpp (Local GGUF Inference + Chat UI)
If llama.cpp is installed, use the unified CLI for one-command deploy:
```bash
# Auto-pipeline: quantize → benchmark → serve → open chat UI
python scripts/llamacpp.py deploy \
  --model outputs/model-f16.gguf \
  --quant q4_k_m --bench --serve

# Or individual steps:
python scripts/llamacpp.py serve --model outputs/model-q4_k_m.gguf --port 8081
python scripts/llamacpp.py chat --model outputs/model-q4_k_m.gguf
```

The `deploy` command also opens `templates/chat_ui.html`, a Gaslamp-styled chat WebUI that connects to the local `llama-server` API.

---

## Troubleshooting Common Errors

### 1. Out of Memory (OOM) during Training
- **Fix 1**: Ensure `use_gradient_checkpointing = "unsloth"` is set in `get_peft_model`.
- **Fix 2**: Reduce `per_device_train_batch_size` to `1` and increase `gradient_accumulation_steps` (e.g., to `4` or `8`).
- **Fix 3**: Reduce `max_seq_length` if the task doesn't require long context.
- **Fix 4**: Switch from LoRA 16-bit to QLoRA 4-bit (`load_in_4bit = True`).
- **Fix 5**: Use a smaller pre-quantized model (e.g., 8B instead of 14B).

### 2. "ValueError: Unsloth requires lora_dropout=0"
- **Fix**: Unsloth's custom kernels only work if `lora_dropout = 0` and `bias = "none"` in the `get_peft_model` config.

### 3. Slow downloading / OOM while loading model
- **Fix**: Use Unsloth's pre-quantized 4-bit models (e.g., `unsloth/llama-3-8b-bnb-4bit`). They download 4x faster and fit reliably in RAM.

### 4. GRPO reward not increasing
- **Fix 1**: Wait at least 300 steps — GRPO is slow to start.
- **Fix 2**: Verify your reward function returns correct scores (print intermediate values).
- **Fix 3**: Use at least 500 rows of training data.
- **Fix 4**: Ensure the model is ≥1.5B params for generating thinking tokens.
- **Fix 5**: Try increasing `num_generations` (e.g., from 4 to 8).

### 5. Vision training errors
- **Fix 1**: Ensure `remove_unused_columns = False` in `SFTConfig`.
- **Fix 2**: Use `UnslothVisionDataCollator` instead of default collator.
- **Fix 3**: Keep image dimensions between 300-1000px.
- **Fix 4**: Verify images are accessible (URLs reachable, local files exist).

### 6. GRPO + vLLM errors
- **Fix 1**: `pip install diffusers` if you get a missing module error.
- **Fix 2**: Update to the latest vLLM version: `pip install --upgrade vllm`.
- **Fix 3**: Ensure `fast_inference = True` is set in `from_pretrained()`.

### 7. Gradient accumulation bug
- **Fix**: Use Unsloth's patched trainers. Standard HuggingFace trainers have a known gradient accumulation bug that Unsloth fixes automatically. See: https://unsloth.ai/blog/gradient

### 8. Hub push failures
- **Fix 1**: Ensure your HF token has write permissions.
- **Fix 2**: Set `push_to_hub = True` and `hub_model_id = "username/model-name"` in config.
- **Fix 3**: For private repos, add `hub_private_repo = True`.

## Phase 3: Evaluation (mlx-tune / Apple Silicon)

After training, direct the user to `scripts/mlx_eval_template.py`. It handles the correct mlx-tune inference API and avoids the common failure modes. Key rules encoded in the template:

1. **Load adapter via `from_pretrained` kwarg** — `adapter_path="outputs/adapters"` passed as `**kwargs`. Omitting it runs the bare base model silently.
2. **Pass raw string to `generate`** — `TokenizerWrapper` is not callable with `return_tensors="pt"`.
3. **Temperature via `make_sampler`** — `generate_step` has no `temperature` float; use `sampler=make_sampler(temp=0.7)`.
4. **Strip echoed prompt** — `mlx_lm` returns the full sequence including prompt; do `raw[len(prompt):]`.

Run modes:
```bash
python ./scripts/mlx_eval_template.py                  # batch
python ./scripts/mlx_eval_template.py --interactive    # REPL
python ./scripts/mlx_eval_template.py --compare        # base vs fine-tuned
python ./scripts/mlx_eval_template.py --style alpaca   # override format
```

### Phase 7: Reflection & Memory Synthesis

After the project is complete (post Phase 6 or 6.5), synthesize what was learned into long-term memory at `~/.gaslamp/`. This is what makes the agent improve over time.

**Step 1 — Extract raw candidates from the completed project:**
```bash
python3 reflect.py . --extract
```
Outputs a JSON array to stdout with candidates from gaslamp.md (`§ 5` environment, `§ 6` hyperparameters, `§ 9` file inventory, `§ 11` workarounds), memory.md (`Discoveries & Notes`), and `.reflect_hints.json` if present. `📖` Learn blocks are skipped — they are generic ML education, not operational lessons.

Inline hints (`section: "inline_hints"`, `pre_flagged: true`) are already identified as lesson/skill/user — classify them quickly in Step 2 rather than reconstructing from context. Gaslamp.md candidates still require full classification.

`reflect.py` is a pinned local copy placed by `init_project.py` — run it from inside the project dir.

**Step 2 — Classify and summarize** each candidate using your own judgment:

**Fast path — inline hints** (`section: "inline_hints"`): if `type_hint` is already set, accept it and write a ≤120-char body directly without full reconstruction. Only run the full classification pass below if `type_hint` is absent.

**Full classification** — for gaslamp.md and memory.md candidates:
- **`LESSON`** — an isolated fact or gotcha (→ `lessons.md`). Write as ≤120-char statement. For `§ 6` (hyperparameters): extract only non-default values that differed from the obvious choice — skip standard lr/batch entries unless they produced a surprising outcome. For `§ 9` (file inventory): extract which template was copied and under what name — the "script source → project filename" mapping is the reusable fact.
- **`USER_PREF`** — hardware/preference signal (→ `user.md`). Update or merge with existing.
- **`SKILL`** — a connected procedure: synthesize across `§ 6` + `§ 9` + `§ 11` into a **scenario recipe** with a `When:` trigger condition (→ `skills.md`). For `§ 11` (workarounds): treat each bullet as a separate candidate — do not batch multiple workarounds into one skill. Format:
  ```
  When: task=<type> AND hardware=<hw> [AND model_size<=<N>B]
  - Phase N: step one
  - Phase N: step two
  Source: <project_dir>
  ```
  A recipe earns its place only when it connects multiple cross-section decisions into a reusable procedure. Single isolated facts stay as lessons.

**Promotion gate fields** — set these on every payload entry (required for gate to function):
- `"priority"`: `"high"` (write to long-term memory) | `"medium"` (project-only) | `"low"` (discard). Promote only facts that will change behaviour on a future project.
- `"durability"`: `"durable"` (stable across projects) | `"recurring"` (likely to recur) | `"transient"` (one-off). Only durable and recurring facts are worth long-term storage.
- `"decision"`: `"promote"` (write to `~/.gaslamp/`) | `"keep_project_only"` (record in `.reflect_decisions.md` but do not promote). Use `keep_project_only` for facts that are specific to this project and unlikely to generalise.
- `"source_candidates"`: list of `candidate_id` strings from the `--extract` output (e.g. `["qwen_chip2_sft:section_11:a1b2c3d4"]`). Include for traceability.

Entries **omitting all four fields** are treated as `priority=high / durability=durable / decision=promote` (v1.1 backwards compat) and will produce a warning. Prefer always including the fields explicitly.

**Step 3 — Write to long-term memory:**

Write `.reflect_payload.json` using this schema, then run `reflect.py --write`:

```json
{
  "user": [
    {
      "title": "Hardware — Apple Silicon",
      "body": "...",
      "date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "priority": "high",
      "durability": "durable",
      "decision": "promote",
      "source_candidates": ["project_dir:section_5:a1b2c3d4"]
    }
  ],
  "lessons": [
    {
      "title": "Short title ≤60 chars",
      "body": "One-sentence statement ≤120 chars",
      "source": "project_dir_name",
      "date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "priority": "high",
      "durability": "durable",
      "decision": "promote",
      "source_candidates": ["project_dir:section_11:e5f6a7b8"]
    }
  ],
  "skills": [
    {
      "title": "Scenario name",
      "when": "task=<type> AND hardware=<hw> [AND model_size<=<N>B]",
      "steps": ["Phase N: step one", "Phase N: step two"],
      "source": "project_dir_name",
      "date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "priority": "high",
      "durability": "durable",
      "decision": "promote",
      "source_candidates": ["project_dir:section_9:c9d0e1f2"]
    }
  ]
}
```

All three top-level keys are optional — omit any that have no entries. `date` defaults to today if omitted. Gate fields (`priority`, `durability`, `decision`) are optional but should always be set explicitly.

```bash
# Preview gate outcomes and decisions without writing:
python3 reflect.py --write --input .reflect_payload.json --dry-run
# Inspect .reflect_decisions.preview.md before committing
# Then write for real:
python3 reflect.py --write --input .reflect_payload.json
```

The script handles dedup (sha256), char-limit enforcement (≤3000 chars for lessons/skills, ≤2000 for user), and quarterly archiving (`~/.gaslamp/archive/`) of evicted oldest entries. After writing, `.reflect_decisions.md` lists every entry with its outcome (promoted / gate_blocked / dup_skipped / evicted_to_archive).

**→ After Phase 7**: Update `gaslamp.md` with a final line in § 11 noting what was reflected: `Reflected to ~/.gaslamp/ on YYYY-MM-DD.`
