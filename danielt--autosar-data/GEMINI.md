# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

```sh
cargo build                          # build the whole workspace
cargo test                           # run all tests
cargo test -p autosar-data <name>    # run a single test by (partial) name
cargo clippy -- -D warnings          # lint; CI fails on any clippy warning
cargo bench -p autosar-data          # criterion benchmarks
cargo run --example demo             # examples: demo, businfo, generate_files, sort
```

The `load_file` and `build_model` benchmarks work on arxml files given by the caller. `load_file`
measures parsing (the file content is read into memory before the measurement, so it measures
parsing, not disk IO); `build_model` loads a file as a setup step and then measures rebuilding an
identical model element by element through the public creation API (`create_sub_element` etc.,
deliberately not `duplicate`/`create_copied_sub_element`), which shows the hotspots of building a
large model from scratch. Both take their input files in the `AUTOSAR_BENCH_FILES` environment
variable, separated by the platform path separator, because criterion consumes the command line of
the benchmark binary itself:

```sh
AUTOSAR_BENCH_FILES=/path/to/big.arxml cargo bench -p autosar-data --bench load_file
AUTOSAR_BENCH_FILES=/path/to/big.arxml cargo bench -p autosar-data --bench build_model
```

`AUTOSAR_BENCH_STRICT` (default: false) and `AUTOSAR_BENCH_SAMPLES` (default: 10) can also be set;
the shared input handling lives in `benches/common/mod.rs`. Without `AUTOSAR_BENCH_FILES` these
benchmarks print a usage note and do nothing.

`cargo bench -p autosar-data-specification --bench regex` is self-contained (no input files) and
does two things. Before measuring anything it **verifies** every validator in `regex.rs` against the
pattern in its doc comment: `benches/common/cases.rs` lists the patterns, and `verify()` compiles
them with the `regex` crate (a dev-dependency) and compares over ~1.3 million generated inputs - all
strings over a per-pattern alphabet up to a given length, every single character edit of every
sample, random strings, and random splices of samples. Any change to `regex.rs`, including a
regeneration, should be run through it. Then it benchmarks every validator (group `patterns`) and
compares the hot identifier and path validators against alternative implementations (groups
`regex_7`, `regex_8`, `regex_22`, `regex_24` and `mixed`, from `benches/common/candidates.rs`). The
validators are `pub(crate)`, so `benches/regex.rs` includes `src/regex.rs` with `#[path]` instead of
going through the public API. `AUTOSAR_REGEX_SKIP_VERIFY=1` skips the verification, which is needed
to benchmark an older revision that the check would reject.

`cargo run --example generate_files` (run it in a scratch directory - it writes to the cwd) produces
one arxml file per Autosar version that covers nearly the whole metamodel; these are useful inputs
for both benchmarks when no real arxml file is at hand.

Coverage (as run in CI): `cargo llvm-cov --all-features --workspace`

Tests live inline in the source files as `#[cfg(test)]` modules, not in separate `tests/` directories.

## Workspace structure

Two crates; `[patch.crates-io]` in the root `Cargo.toml` makes `autosar-data` build against the local `autosar-data-specification` instead of the published version.

### autosar-data-specification

A `no_std` crate containing the combined AUTOSAR metamodel of all 22 AUTOSAR 4 XSD revisions (4.0.1 through R25-11) as static Rust data tables.

- `specification.rs`, `elementname.rs`, `enumitem.rs`, `attributename.rs`, and `regex.rs` are **generated code** (from parsing the AUTOSAR .xsd files, by an external generator not in this repo). Do not hand-edit them except when regeneration is impossible; changes to the metamodel come from regeneration. Exception: every validator in `regex.rs` is hand-written (the generated DFA state tables were removed) and the generator is expected to emit these forms - preserve them across a regeneration, and check the result with the `regex` benchmark, which compares each validator against its pattern.
- The central type is `ElementType`, an index into the static tables. `ElementType::ROOT` is the type of the `<AUTOSAR>` root element.
- Version applicability is encoded as `u32` bitmasks, one bit per `AutosarVersion`. APIs like `find_sub_element(name, version_mask)` filter by these masks.
- `ElementName` ↔ `ElementType` is an n:m mapping — never assume a name determines a type or vice versa. Name lookup uses a generated perfect hash (`hashfunc`).
- Feature `docstrings` (off by default) compiles in element documentation strings.

### autosar-data

The user-facing API for reading, modifying, and writing arxml files. All data is validated against the specification crate on load and on every mutation.

**Handle/Raw pattern:** every public type is a cheap-to-clone handle wrapping shared state — `AutosarModel(Arc<RwLock<AutosarModelRaw>>)`, `ArxmlFile(...ArxmlFileRaw)`, `Element(...ElementRaw)` — each with a `Weak*` counterpart used for back-references (child→parent, element→model) to avoid reference cycles. Public API methods in `element.rs` acquire the lock and delegate to the implementation on `ElementRaw` in `elementraw.rs`.

**Deadlock avoidance:** operations that traverse upward (e.g. `path()`, `file()`) and operations that lock downward (e.g. `create_copied_sub_element()`) can run concurrently. Parent locks are therefore only taken with `try_lock` and a ~10ms timeout; on timeout the operation fails with `AutosarDataError::ParentElementLocked` rather than deadlocking. Keep this in mind when adding any operation that holds an element lock while touching parents.

**Model-level caches** in `AutosarModelRaw` must be kept consistent by every mutating operation:
- `identifiables`: map of AUTOSAR path → element, for `get_element_by_path()`
- `reference_origins`: reverse map of reference target path → referencing elements, for `get_references_to()`. Both absolute and relative references are keyed by the **resolved absolute path** of their target
- `relative_references`: reverse index mapping each reference that has a BASE attribute to the key it is currently registered under, or `None` while its reference base is not in scope

The guiding rule: cache only what an element cannot tell you on its own. A resolved target path needs the whole model, so it is cached; the character data and BASE attribute of a reference are read from the element and never mirrored. A REFERENCE-BASE declaration is therefore *not* cached — `Element::resolve_reference_base()` reads it from the tree by walking up the ancestor packages, which is also exactly the AUTOSAR scope rule.

Registration is syntactic and resolution is a separate pass: `add_reference_origin()` is called in contexts that hold element locks, so it records a relative reference as unresolved, and `AutosarModel::resolve_relative_references()` computes the target paths afterwards. Every operation that can change what a relative reference means (the reference itself, a REFERENCE-BASE in scope, or the package containing the reference) must call it, and must not do so while holding an element lock. It early-outs for models without relative references.

`#[cfg(test)] AutosarModel::verify_reference_caches()` checks both caches against the element tree in both directions; assert it in any test that mutates references or reference bases.

**Multi-file model:** one `AutosarModel` merges any number of arxml files into a single element tree. Each element tracks which files it belongs to via `file_membership`; merging is only allowed to diverge on elements the metamodel marks as *splittable*. Serialization filters the tree per file.

**Parsing:** `lexer.rs` + `parser.rs` implement a custom arxml parser that validates structure, attributes, and character data against the specification during parsing. Loading takes a `strict` flag: non-strict mode turns certain errors into warnings so structurally sound but invalid data can still be loaded.

`chardata.rs` handles typed character data (`CharacterData`: Enum/String/UnsignedInteger/Float) including validation against `CharacterDataSpec` and conversion.

## Conventions

- `#![warn(missing_docs)]` is set in autosar-data: all public items need doc comments.
- Errors are all variants of `AutosarDataError` (thiserror); add a variant rather than introducing a new error type.
- Rust edition 2024.
- User-visible changes are recorded in `Changelog.md` at the repo root.
