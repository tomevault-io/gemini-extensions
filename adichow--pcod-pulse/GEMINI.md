# AGENTS.md - PCOD Tracker Project

## Project Goal

Build a simple, free PCOD/PCOS tracking platform for real users.

The product helps users track:

* Period cycles
* Symptoms
* Weight
* Medications
* Basic analytics
* Doctor-friendly reports

Core principle:

No hidden paywalls. No ads. No locked health history. Core health tracking stays free.

---

## Target Users

Women with PCOD/PCOS who currently track health information across multiple places such as period apps, notes, WhatsApp, memory, or paper.

Initial users:

* Girlfriend
* Her friends with PCOD/PCOS

Success metric:

At least 5 users use the app.
At least 3 users continue using it after 30 days.

---

## Product Philosophy

Build useful before clever.

Do not add AI, community, doctor marketplace, diet plans, or predictions in MVP.

The app should be:

* Simple
* Fast
* Private
* Mobile-friendly
* Easy to log daily
* Useful during doctor visits

---

## Tech Stack

### Backend

Use:

* Java 17 or Java 21
* Spring Boot 3.x
* Spring Web
* Spring Data JPA
* Spring Security
* JWT authentication
* PostgreSQL
* Flyway
* Maven
* Docker

Backend must serve both website and mobile app.

---

### Web Frontend

Use:

* React
* Vite
* Axios
* React Router
* Recharts or Chart.js

Website must be responsive and mobile-friendly.

---

### Mobile App

Use later:

* React Native
* Same backend APIs
* Android first

Do not start mobile app before web MVP is usable.

---

## Backend Package Structure

Use this structure:

com.pcodtracker

* config
* auth
* user
* cycle
* symptom
* weight
* medication
* dashboard
* report
* common
* exception

Each feature should contain:

* Entity
* Repository

Example:

cycle/

* Cycle.java
* CycleRepository.java
* CycleRequest.java
* CycleResponse.java
* CycleService.java
* CycleController.java

---

## API Design

All authenticated APIs must use JWT.

### Auth APIs

POST /api/auth/register

Request:

{
"name": "Riya",
"email": "[riya@example.com](mailto:riya@example.com)",
"password": "password123",
"age": 29,
"heightCm": 160
}

POST /api/auth/login

Request:

{
"email": "[riya@example.com](mailto:riya@example.com)",
"password": "password123"
}

Response:

{
"token": "jwt-token"
}

---

### Cycle APIs

POST /api/cycles

GET /api/cycles

GET /api/cycles/summary

DELETE /api/cycles/{id}

---

### Symptom APIs

POST /api/symptoms

GET /api/symptoms

GET /api/symptoms/summary

DELETE /api/symptoms/{id}

---

### Weight APIs

POST /api/weights

GET /api/weights

GET /api/weights/summary

DELETE /api/weights/{id}

---

### Medication APIs

POST /api/medications

GET /api/medications

PATCH /api/medications/{id}

POST /api/medications/{id}/logs

GET /api/medications/adherence

---

### Dashboard API

GET /api/dashboard

Response should combine:

* daysSinceLastPeriod
* currentCycleLength
* latestWeight
* weightChangeLast30Days
* symptomsLoggedThisWeek
* medicationAdherencePercent

---

### Report API

GET /api/reports/health-summary?range=90

Response should include:

* cycle summary

---

## Security Rules

* Passwords must be hashed using BCrypt.
* Never store plain text passwords.
* Each user can access only their own data.
* Do not expose internal IDs unnecessarily in public response if avoidable.
* Validate all request bodies.
* Return clean error responses.

---

## Error Response Format

Use this format:

{
"timestamp": "2026-06-11T10:00:00",
"status": 400,
"error": "Bad Request",
"message": "Validation failed",
"path": "/api/cycles",
"errors": [
{
"field": "startDate",
"message": "Start date is required"
}
]
}

---

## Do Not Build Yet

Do not build these in MVP:

* AI chatbot
* Paid subscription
* Community forum
* Doctor marketplace
* Diet plan
* Calorie tracker
* Lab report analyzer
* Complex prediction engine
* Social sharing
* Partner mode

---

## Testing Expectations

Backend:

* Unit tests for service layer
* Repository tests where needed
* Controller tests for main APIs
* At least happy path and validation failure tests

Frontend:

* Manual testing is acceptable for MVP
* Keep components clean and reusable

---

## Coding Style

Backend:

* Use DTOs.
* Do not expose entities directly.
* Use constructor injection.
* Keep controllers thin.
* Keep business logic in services.
* Use transactions where needed.
* Use clear method names.

Frontend:

* Use feature-based folder structure.
* Keep API calls in separate service files.
* Use reusable form and card components.
* Handle loading and error states.

---

## Final Product Goal

The first usable version should allow a real user to:

1. Register
2. Log in
3. Add period cycle
4. Log symptoms
5. Log weight
6. Add medicines
7. Mark medicines taken
8. Open dashboard
9. View simple health summary

If this works cleanly, the MVP is successful.
