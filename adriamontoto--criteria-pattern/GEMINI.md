## Project Overview

Criteria Pattern is a typed Python package that standardizes criteria-based filtering, validation, ordering, pagination, and SQL/query conversion. It exposes value-object-backed models for filters, orders, and criteria, plus converters for SQL dialects and URL query parameters.

Key paths:

- `criteria_pattern/models/criteria.py`: `Criteria` plus `AndCriteria`, `OrCriteria`, and `NotCriteria` composition.
- `criteria_pattern/models/filter/`: filter fields, operators, values, and the `Operator` enum.
- `criteria_pattern/models/order/`: order fields, directions, and the `Direction` enum.
- `criteria_pattern/models/filters.py` and `criteria_pattern/models/orders.py`: list value objects for filter and order collections.
- `criteria_pattern/converters/`: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite, and URL-to-criteria converters.
- `criteria_pattern/errors/`: package-specific integrity, validation, and bounds errors.
- `criteria_pattern/models/testing/mothers/`: object mother helpers used by tests and downstream users.
- `tests/`: pytest suite organized to mirror `criteria_pattern/`.
- `pyproject.toml`: package metadata and tool configuration.
- `Makefile`: canonical local workflow.

This is a single-package Python project, not a monorepo. It supports Python `>=3.11` and CI tests Python `3.11`, `3.12`, `3.13`, and `3.14` on Ubuntu and Windows.

## Setup Commands

Run commands from the repository root.

- Show available project commands: `make help`
- Create the default virtual environment, install all dependency groups, and install hooks: `make setup`
- Create all configured virtual environments: `make setup-all`
- Install all dependency groups into an existing environment: `make install`
- Install one dependency group: `make install GROUP=test`, `make install GROUP=lint`, `make install GROUP=format`, or `make install GROUP=release`

The Makefile defaults to:

- `UV_BIN=uv`
- `PYTHON_VERSION=3.14`
- `PYTHON_VERSIONS=3.11,3.12,3.13,3.14`
- `PYTHON_VIRTUAL_ENVIRONMENT=.venv$(PYTHON_VERSION)`, so the default environment is `.venv3.14`

If Python 3.14 is unavailable locally, pass a supported version explicitly, for example:

```bash
make setup PYTHON_VERSION=3.13 PYTHON_VIRTUAL_ENVIRONMENT=.venv3.13
```

After setup, activate the environment when useful:

```bash
source .venv3.14/bin/activate
```

There is no database, message broker, or application server to start.

## Development Workflow

- Prefer the Make targets over ad hoc tool invocations.
- Keep changes scoped to the requested behavior; avoid unrelated cleanup.
- Add or update tests for behavior changes.
- For public API changes, update exports in `criteria_pattern/__init__.py` or package `__init__.py` files as needed.
- Keep `criteria_pattern/py.typed` present so package typing remains advertised.
- This repository currently has no lockfile; avoid introducing dependency lockfile churn unless the task is explicitly about dependency management.
- `make clean` removes configured virtual environments, caches, coverage files, and generated output. Treat it as destructive and do not run it unless the task calls for cleanup.

Use this local verification loop for code changes:

```bash
make format
make lint
make test
make coverage
```

For multi-version checks when the interpreters are available:

```bash
make test-all
make coverage-all
```

For documentation-only changes, run the smallest relevant check and state what was skipped if full verification is not needed.

## Testing Instructions

- Run all tests: `make test`
- Run all configured Python versions: `make test-all`
- Run coverage: `make coverage`
- Run all-version coverage: `make coverage-all`
- Run tests directly after setup: `.venv3.14/bin/python3.14 -m pytest --config-file pyproject.toml`
- Run a specific file: `.venv3.14/bin/python3.14 -m pytest tests/converters/test_criteria_to_postgresql_converter.py --config-file pyproject.toml`
- Run a focused test expression: `.venv3.14/bin/python3.14 -m pytest -k "url_to_criteria" --config-file pyproject.toml`
- Reproduce a randomized test order or data failure: `.venv3.14/bin/python3.14 -m pytest --config-file pyproject.toml --randomly-seed=<seed>`

If setup used a different `PYTHON_VERSION`, adjust the `.venv3.14/bin/python3.14` path or activate the environment and use `python -m pytest ...`.

Test conventions:

- Tests live under `tests/` and mirror package structure.
- Test files use `test_*.py` naming.
- Existing tests use `pytest.mark.unit_testing`.
- Assertions are plain `assert`; Ruff permits `assert` in test files.
- Test data helpers come from `object_mother_pattern` and `criteria_pattern.models.testing.mothers`.
- Tests use `pytest-randomly`, so do not write assertions whose expected value depends on random object-mother output ordering or primitive conversion side effects.
- Keep exact string and `to_primitives()` assertions deterministic. Prefer fixed values over object mothers when testing formatting or serialization output.
- Converter tests use `sqlglot`/`sqlglotrs` for SQL parsing and validation where useful.

Coverage is configured in `pyproject.toml` with branch coverage enabled for `criteria_pattern`. CI expects 100% minimum coverage for published reports, so consider uncovered branches and failure paths when changing behavior.

## Code Style

The canonical style is defined in `pyproject.toml`.

- Format with Ruff: `make format`
- Lint and type-check with Ruff and mypy: `make lint`
- Ruff line length is `120`.
- Ruff format uses single quotes and spaces for indentation.
- Mypy runs in strict mode.
- Imports are sorted by Ruff/isort with `criteria_pattern` as first-party.
- Public modules and classes use docstrings following the existing PEP 257 style.
- Keep runtime code compatible with Python `>=3.11`.
- When using `typing.override`, preserve the existing compatibility pattern that imports from `typing` on Python 3.12+ and from `typing_extensions` otherwise.
- Use existing `value_object_pattern` value objects, validators, and collection patterns when nearby code does so.

Architecture conventions:

- New criteria models should follow the existing value-object-backed model style.
- New filter operators belong in `criteria_pattern/models/filter/operator.py`; update validation, converters, and tests together.
- New order directions belong in `criteria_pattern/models/order/direction.py`; update validation, converters, and tests together.
- SQL converter behavior is dialect-specific. Update each dialect converter only when the behavior applies to that dialect.
- URL parsing behavior belongs in `criteria_pattern/converters/url_to_criteria_converter.py`.
- Package-specific exceptions belong under `criteria_pattern/errors/`.
- Test-only object mothers belong under `criteria_pattern/models/testing/mothers/`.

## Build And Release

- Build distributions locally: `make build-code`
- Build output is written to `dist/`.
- Do not publish packages manually from an agent session.
- Releases are managed in CI on pushes to `master` using `python-semantic-release`.
- Version is read from `criteria_pattern/__init__.py`.
- Changelog generation uses templates in `docs/changelog_template/`.

Semantic-release is configured for Conventional Commits:

- Minor release tags: `feat`
- Patch release tags: `fix`, `perf`, `build`
- Other conventional types such as `docs`, `test`, `refactor`, and `ci` may be valid for commit hygiene but do not bump by default according to the local semantic-release config.

## Security

- Run dependency audit when security or dependency changes are involved: `make audit`
- Run secret scanning when touching configuration, CI, release, or credential-adjacent files: `make secrets`
- Never read or print secrets. Do not inspect `.env` files; use examples or placeholders instead.
- Treat SQL converter changes carefully. Preserve parameterized query behavior and table/column validation paths.
- Security vulnerabilities should be handled through GitHub Security Advisories, not public issues.

## CI And Pull Requests

CI runs on pushes and pull requests targeting `master`, plus a scheduled daily run. The main checks are:

- Tests and coverage on Ubuntu and Windows across Python `3.11` through `3.14`
- Format check with `make format` followed by a clean working tree assertion
- Lint and type check with `make lint`
- CodeQL analysis
- Secret scanning
- Dependency audit
- Semantic release and PyPI publish on successful pushes to `master`

Before opening or updating a PR, run:

```bash
make format
make lint
make test
make coverage
```

PRs should use `.github/pull_request_template.md`. Commits are expected to follow Conventional Commits and the repository accepts signed and signed-off commits.

## Agent Notes

- Inspect the relevant files before editing.
- Preserve existing project structure and naming.
- Prefer small, reviewable diffs.
- Do not create, switch, delete, or rewrite Git branches unless explicitly asked.
- Do not commit unless explicitly asked.
- Do not run externally visible release or publish steps from a local agent session.
- Be careful with randomized test data. If a test asserts a concrete string, primitive dictionary, SQL string, or parameter order, use explicit fixed input values unless randomness is the behavior under test.
