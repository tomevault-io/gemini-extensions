## Engineering Priorities

When making code changes, always prefer correctness over shortcuts. Do not
paper over bugs, weaken tests, hard-code narrow cases, or choose expedient
workarounds when a sound fix is within scope; take the time to preserve the
intended semantics and verify the change appropriately.

Prefer the implementation path that leads to the highest quality code over the
shortest path to a working change. When a quick fix would make later design,
ownership, or semantic boundaries worse, choose the more durable approach and
keep the scope focused on the requested outcome.

## Zig Development

Use `zigdoc` to discover current APIs for the Zig standard library and any third-party dependencies before coding.

Examples:
```bash
zigdoc std.fs
zigdoc std.posix.getuid
zigdoc vaxis.Window
```

## Validation

Use these commands for repository validation:

```bash
zig fmt .
zig build compile-check
zig build lint
zig build test
zig build conformance
```

## POSIX Conformance Target

Rush `--posix` targets POSIX.1-2024 / Issue 8 unless a test or code comment
explicitly documents a deliberate compatibility choice. When checking shell
language requirements, prefer the Issue 8 text at `pubs.opengroup.org` over
older Issue 7 / POSIX.1-2017 references.

When running conformance comparisons against other shells, use only the primary
installed-base reference shells below unless the user explicitly asks for a
platform-specific shell:

```bash
zig build conformance -- --shell dash --mode posix
zig build conformance -- --shell bash --shell-arg --posix --mode posix
zig build conformance -- --shell yash --mode posix
```

The full conformance suite intentionally prints compact one-line failures. Add
`--diff` for detailed stdout/stderr diffs, or add `--case TEXT` to run matching
case names only; `--case` implies detailed diffs.

Conformance comparisons are primarily a Rush validation tool, not a requirement
that every reference shell pass every case. If Rush matches the documented POSIX
target or an intentional compatibility choice, a reference-shell mismatch is
acceptable evidence about that shell's behavior. Do not weaken a test solely to
make dash, Bash, or yash pass; only relax expectations when the relaxed output is
still the intended Rush contract.

The Bash reference is current stable GNU Bash in POSIX mode; do not substitute
macOS `/bin/bash` 3.2 or `/bin/sh` for it. The yash reference is current yash in
POSIX mode. If one of these shells is not installed, report that it was not run
rather than silently using another shell. FreeBSD `/bin/sh`, macOS `/bin/sh`,
BusyBox ash, ksh, and other shells are secondary/platform references only.

## Current Zig Patterns

**ArrayList:**
```zig
var list: std.ArrayList(u32) = .empty;
defer list.deinit(allocator);
try list.append(allocator, 42);
```

**HashMap/StringHashMap (default to unmanaged):**
```zig
var map: std.StringHashMapUnmanaged(u32) = .empty;
defer map.deinit(allocator);
try map.put(allocator, "key", 42);
```

**stdout/stderr writer:**
```zig
var buf: [4096]u8 = undefined;
var writer = std.fs.File.stdout().writer(&buf);
defer writer.interface.flush() catch {};
try writer.interface.print("hello {s}\n", .{"world"});
```

**build.zig executable:**
```zig
b.addExecutable(.{
    .name = "foo",
    .root_module = b.createModule(.{
        .root_source_file = b.path("src/main.zig"),
        .target = target,
        .optimize = optimize,
    }),
});
```

**JSON writing:**
```zig
var buf: [4096]u8 = undefined;
var writer = std.fs.File.stdout().writer(&buf);
defer writer.interface.flush() catch {};

var jw: std.json.Stringify = .{
    .writer = &writer.interface,
    .options = .{ .whitespace = .indent_2 },
};
try jw.write(my_struct);
```

**Allocating writer:**
```zig
var writer: std.Io.Writer.Allocating = .init(allocator);
defer writer.deinit();
try writer.writer.print("hello {s}", .{"world"});
const output = try writer.toOwnedSlice();
```

## Zig Style

- `camelCase` for functions and methods
- lower-case `snake_case` for variables, parameters, and constants
- `PascalCase` for types, structs, and enums
- prefer `const foo: Type = .{ .field = value };` over `const foo = Type{ .field = value };`
- pass allocators explicitly; use `errdefer` for cleanup on error
- keep tests inline with the code they cover; register them in `src/main.zig`
- keep lines under 120 characters
- prefer Zig multiline string literals over string concatenation with `++` for
  long strings

### Files and Types

- Treat every `.zig` file as a namespace. Make the file itself a type only when
  its root represents one primary stateful abstraction with fields and methods.
- Name a file-backed type `PascalCase.zig`, import it directly with
  `const Widget = @import("Widget.zig");`, and begin it with an optional `//!`
  container doc followed by `const Widget = @This();`. Prefer the concrete type
  name over `Self` so signatures remain clear out of context.
- Use lower-case `snake_case.zig` for namespace modules: related free functions,
  constants, multiple peer types, or package facades. Export named types from
  these modules and import them as `@import("widget.zig").Widget`.
- Do not put a sole `pub const Widget = struct { ... };` inside `Widget.zig`;
  the file root already provides that container. Conversely, do not create a
  file-backed type merely to enforce one-type-per-file organization.
- Preferred file start: `//!` container docs when needed, the file-backed type
  alias when applicable, imports and local aliases, then a scoped logger.

### Comments and Documentation

- Use `//!` at the start of a nontrivial file to document the root namespace or
  file-backed type: its purpose, conceptual model, and major invariants. Omit it
  for trivial facades whose exports make the purpose obvious.
- Use `///` for declaration-level contracts. Document public APIs when the name
  and signature do not fully convey ownership and lifetime, allocation,
  mutation or pointer invalidation, errors or nullability, units and ranges,
  thread safety, side effects, or asserted preconditions. Simple re-exports and
  self-explanatory declarations do not need filler documentation.
- Use `//` for implementation rationale, state invariants, workarounds, and
  signposts for non-obvious algorithm phases. Do not narrate syntax or restate
  the code. Doc comments must not contain notes intended only for maintainers.
- Keep comments accurate when behavior changes. Prefer deleting a stale or
  redundant comment over expanding it.

### File Size

- Cohesion, not line count, decides when to split a file. As review triggers,
  prefer hand-written files below roughly 1,000 lines, actively look for a
  cohesive extraction once a file crosses that size, and treat files above
  roughly 2,000 lines as exceptional. These are not hard limits.
- Split when a file contains independently nameable responsibilities, disjoint
  subsystems, or helpers with their own invariants. Extract a real subordinate
  type, parser, formatter, platform backend, or pure algorithm rather than an
  arbitrary range of methods.
- Keep a large file intact when its declarations jointly implement one cohesive
  type and splitting would add forwarding APIs or make invariants harder to
  follow. Generated code, data tables, and version-specific compatibility
  snapshots are exempt from the size guidance.

## Architecture

- Prefer direct execution from a small shell AST. Do not reintroduce broad
  command-plan, state-delta, or output-routing architectures unless the user
  explicitly changes the rewrite direction.
- Keep shell semantics in `src/shell/*`: command lookup, assignment persistence,
  redirection policy, pipeline status, control flow, and mutation boundaries.
- All evaluation-time host effects go through a comptime-known concrete Host
  type. The evaluator must not call `std.Io`, `std.posix`, `std.fs`,
  `std.process`, signal, terminal, clock, or global environment APIs directly.
- `RealHost` should use `std.posix` or targeted platform APIs directly. Do not
  use `std.Io` as the evaluator effects boundary.
- Make ownership and mutation boundaries explicit. Many bugs are state commits
  to the wrong owner, lifetime, process, or abstraction layer; in shell execution,
  this especially means making current-shell vs child/subshell mutation explicit.
- Main owns the root allocator: DebugAllocator in Debug and `std.heap.smp_allocator`
  otherwise. All shell allocators must derive from that root allocator.
- Use arena allocators heavily for parser/evaluator lifetimes. Persistent shell
  state owns its strings through the shell state's allocator; AST and per-command
  expansion data should normally live in resettable arenas.

## Safety

- Use TigerStyle/TigerBeetle-like assertions at API boundaries, state transitions,
  parser/evaluator construction points, and mutation commit/discard points; avoid
  trivial assertions.
- Assertions are for Rush/programmer/model bugs only: impossible states,
  contradictory mutations, invalid AST shapes, mismatched counts, invalid enum
  combinations, or mutation targets that violate the semantic model.
- Ordinary user/script/input/runtime errors must be diagnostics, error values,
  statuses, or `CommandOutcome` values, not assertions: syntax errors, command
  not found, permission denied, failed redirections, readonly assignment
  failures, invalid builtin usage, parse failures, malformed input, missing
  files, and other expected behavior.
- Keep functions small and push pure computation into helpers.
