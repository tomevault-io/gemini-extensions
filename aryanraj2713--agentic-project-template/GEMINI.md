This is a **generic, reusable full-stack monorepo template**. It is meant to be cloned
as the starting point for new, unrelated projects. It ships **scaffolding, tooling,
documentation, and minimal working examples** — never project-specific business logic.
Read this guide fully before making changes, and follow it on every task.

---

## 1. Purpose

This template gives you a typed, conventional starting point for a full-stack project:

- A typed **Python backend** (FastAPI, managed with `uv`) at `apps/api`.
- A typed **TypeScript frontend** (Next.js App Router, managed with `pnpm`) at `apps/web`.
- A reserved **shared package** placeholder at `packages/shared`.

The goal is to let a Developer (human or AI agent) start building immediately with all
static checks passing from the first clone. Everything is typed end to end: Python uses
full type hints checked by `ty`; TypeScript runs in strict mode checked by `tsc --noEmit`.

The template stays **small, flat, explicit, and generic**. It is production-ready without
being enterprise-heavy. Example code uses placeholder names (an `Item` resource with an
`id` and a `name`) and carries no domain meaning, so it can be cloned into any project
without inheriting anything that must be deleted.

> **No testing setup — by design.** This template intentionally has **no testing setup**.
> Tests are **not required**, and **no test runner, test framework, or test scaffolding**
> is provided by default. Do not add one as part of routine work. Correctness is verified
> through the static checks described in [§8](#8-type-checking--linting). See
> [§14](#14-prohibited-actions).

---

## 2. Repository Map

The repository has exactly two top-level code directories — `apps/` and `packages/` —
plus root documentation and configuration. There is **no third top-level application
directory**.

## 3. Core Principles

1. **Typed end to end.** Every Python function has typed parameters and a typed return
   value; TypeScript runs in strict mode. The "tests" for this template are the static
   checks (type checking, linting, format checking), not a test runner.
2. **Small, flat, explicit.** Predictable layout with one clearly-named file per
   responsibility. A request can be read top to bottom, from route to database.
3. **Generic.** Example code uses placeholder names and carries no business logic, so the
   template can be cloned into unrelated projects without deleting inherited domain code.
4. **Production-ready without enterprise heaviness.** No auth, containers, CI, or
   background workers in the default scaffold. Add them per-project only when a real
   project needs them.

## 3. Code Quality Instructions

1. Place all constants, configurations, JSON schemas, and enums in dedicated `config`, `constants`, or `enums` files.
2. Break large code blocks into smaller, modular functions, services, or reusable components wherever possible.
3. Follow standard file and folder naming conventions to keep the project structure clean and predictable.
4. Keep docstrings short, clear, and useful. Avoid overly long explanations.
5. Add concise comments only where they improve readability or explain non-obvious logic. Avoid unnecessary comments.


## 4. Backend Instructions

The Backend_App lives at `apps/api` and is managed with `uv`.

- **Python 3.12+** (`requires-python = ">=3.12"` in `pyproject.toml`).
- **One file per responsibility** in `app/`:
  - `main.py` — creates the FastAPI app and registers routers; contains **no route logic**.
  - `config.py` — typed `Settings` object populated from environment variables.
  - `db.py` — SQLAlchemy engine, `SessionLocal` factory, and the `get_db` dependency.
  - `models.py` — declarative `Base` and ORM models.
  - `schemas.py` — Pydantic v2 request/response models.
  - `routes.py` — application API routes.
  - `health.py` — the Health_Endpoint, kept separate from application routes.
- **Every function is fully typed** — typed parameters **and** a typed return value. No
  exceptions; this is what `ty` verifies.
- The FastAPI application object is **`app.main:app`**. Run it with
  `uv run uvicorn app.main:app --reload` from within `apps/api`.
- Routers are defined in `routes.py` and `health.py` and registered in `main.py` via
  `app.include_router(...)`.
- The database schema is created **only** by the Migration_System (Alembic). Never call
  `Base.metadata.create_all(...)`.

---

## 5. Frontend Instructions

The Frontend_App lives at `apps/web` and is managed with `pnpm`.

- **Next.js App Router only.** Use the `app/` directory. Do **not** create a `pages/`
  directory (the legacy Pages Router is omitted).
- **Strict TypeScript.** `tsconfig.json` enables `"strict": true`. Keep it strict.
- **Styling with Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui.** Global styles are in `app/globals.css`;
  generated UI primitives live in `components/ui/`.
- **All backend calls go through `lib/api.ts`.** Never use inline `fetch` inside
  components. Add a typed helper to `lib/api.ts` and call it from the component.
- **Always render loading and error states** for any view that fetches data.

---

## 6. Database & Migration Rules

- **Alembic is the only schema creator.** There is **no `create_all`** anywhere. Every
  schema change is a reviewable, versioned migration.
- **`Base.metadata` in `app/models.py` is the autogenerate target.** `alembic/env.py`
  imports `Base` from `app.models` and sets `target_metadata = Base.metadata`.
- **The connection URL comes from the environment** (`DATABASE_URL` via `Settings`), not a
  hardcoded `sqlalchemy.url` in `alembic.ini`.
- **PostgreSQL is the default** database (see `apps/api/.env.example`).

Workflow when you change a model (run within `apps/api`):

```bash
# 1. Generate a migration from the model change
uv run alembic revision --autogenerate -m "describe the change"

# 2. Review the generated file under alembic/versions/, then apply it
uv run alembic upgrade head
```

---

## 7. Dependency Management

- **Backend uses `uv` only.** Add/sync dependencies through `uv`; dependencies are
  declared in `apps/api/pyproject.toml`.
  ```bash
  uv add <package>      # add a runtime dependency
  uv add --dev <package> # add a dev dependency
  uv sync               # install/sync the environment from the lockfile
  ```
  Commit `apps/api/uv.lock`.
- **Frontend uses `pnpm` only.** Never use `npm` or `yarn` in `apps/web`.
  ```bash
  pnpm add <package>     # add a dependency
  pnpm add -D <package>  # add a dev dependency
  pnpm install           # install from the lockfile
  ```
  Commit `apps/web/pnpm-lock.yaml`. **Never commit `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock`** —
  they are excluded by `.gitignore` and must stay out of version control.

---

## 8. Type Checking & Linting

These are the **verification gates**. Work is not done until they all pass.

**Backend** (run within `apps/api`):

```bash
uv run ty check               # type checking — must report zero errors
uv run ruff check .           # linting — must report zero errors
uv run ruff format --check .  # formatting — must report all files formatted
```

(Use `uv run ruff format .` to auto-format before checking.)

**Frontend** (run within `apps/web`):

```bash
pnpm lint        # linting — must report zero errors
pnpm typecheck   # tsc --noEmit — must report zero type errors
```

There is **no test command** to run — this template has no testing setup (see
[§1](#1-purpose) and [§14](#14-prohibited-actions)). The static checks above are the
complete verification suite.

---

## 9. AI Agent Workflow

On every task:

1. **Read `AGENTS.md` first** (this file) and follow its conventions. It is the
   authoritative source of truth and wins on any conflict.
2. **Follow the established conventions** — file layout, typing, the one-file-per-
   responsibility backend structure, and the `lib/api.ts` rule on the frontend.
3. **Make the change** in the smallest, most explicit way that fits the existing patterns.
4. **Run the checks before considering work done:** all backend checks within `apps/api`
   and all frontend checks within `apps/web` (see [§8](#8-type-checking--linting)).
5. **If you changed structure, build, or run steps, update `AGENTS.md` (and `Setup.md`/
   `README.md` where relevant) in the same change.**

---

## 10. Safe Refactoring Rules

- **Keep changes small and focused.** Refactor one responsibility at a time.
- **Preserve types.** Do not weaken or drop type annotations; both apps stay fully typed.
- **Preserve the layout.** Keep one file per backend responsibility; keep all backend
  calls in `lib/api.ts` on the frontend.
- **Run the checks after every refactor** ([§8](#8-type-checking--linting)) and fix any
  issues before finishing.
- **Do not add scope.** A refactor should not introduce auth, tests, CI, containers, or
  speculative abstractions (see [§14](#14-prohibited-actions)).

---

## 11. API Design Rules

- **RESTful resource routes.** Group routes by resource using an `APIRouter` with a
  resource `prefix` (the example uses `/items`).
- **Explicit `response_model`.** Every route declares an explicit `response_model` backed
  by a **Pydantic v2** schema from `schemas.py`. Use `ConfigDict(from_attributes=True)` so
  ORM objects serialize cleanly.
- **Sessions via the `get_db` dependency.** When a route needs the database, obtain the
  session with `db: Session = Depends(get_db)` — never construct sessions inline.
- **No business logic in `main.py`.** It only composes routers.
- **Keep examples generic.** Use placeholder resource names; do not embed project-specific
  semantics in the template's example route.

---

## 12. Frontend Design Rules

- **Typed helpers in `lib/api.ts`.** Every backend call is a typed function in `lib/api.ts`
  with a typed return. Components import and call those helpers; they never `fetch` inline.
- **Base URL from `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`.** `lib/api.ts` reads the backend base URL from
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` and throws a **named error** if it is missing at call time.
- **Render loading and error states.** Any data-fetching view shows a loading state while
  pending and an error state when a request fails.
- **shadcn primitives go in `components/ui/`.** Add them with the shadcn CLI:
  ```bash
  pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add <component>
  ```

---

## 13. Environment Variables

- **Backend:** `DATABASE_URL` is read by `app/config.py` (and Alembic). Configure it in
  `apps/api/.env` (copy from the committed `apps/api/.env.example`). PostgreSQL by default.
- **Frontend:** `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` is read by `lib/api.ts`. Configure it in
  `apps/web/.env.local` (copy from the committed `apps/web/.env.local.example`).
- **Use the example files.** `.env.example` and `.env.local.example` are committed and
  contain **placeholder values only**.
- **Never commit real secrets.** Real `.env` and `.env.local` files are excluded by
  `.gitignore` and must stay out of version control.

---

## 14. Prohibited Actions

Do **not**, as part of routine work on this template:

- **Add any test scaffolding** — no test runner, test framework, or test files. This
  template intentionally has **no testing setup**, and tests are **not required**.
- **Add authentication or authorization.** Omitted from the default scaffold.
- **Add containerization** (Dockerfiles, compose files, etc.). Omitted by default.
- **Add continuous integration** (CI workflows/pipelines). Omitted by default.
- **Add background workers** (queues, schedulers, task runners). Omitted by default.
- **Add project-specific business logic.** The template stays generic; examples use
  generic placeholder names (e.g., `Item`) and carry no domain meaning.
- **Put speculative code in `packages/shared`.** Add code there only when it is genuinely
  shared by more than one consumer.
- **Use inline `fetch` in components.** All backend calls go through `lib/api.ts`.
- **Commit `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock`.** Frontend uses `pnpm` (`pnpm-lock.yaml`).
- **Call `Base.metadata.create_all(...)`.** Alembic is the only schema creator.

---

## 15. Required Skills

To work in this repository you should be comfortable with:

- **`uv`** — Python environment, dependency, and command runner for the backend.
- **`ty`** — Python type checker (the backend type-checking gate).
- **`ruff`** — Python linter and formatter (the backend lint/format gates).
- **Node.js + `pnpm`** — the frontend runtime and package manager.
- **shadcn CLI** — adding UI primitives via `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add <component>`.

See [`Setup.md`](Setup.md) (the Setup_Guide) for installation instructions for each tool,
including what to do if a tool is unavailable in your environment.

---

## 16. New-Feature Workflow

A typical full-stack feature, end to end:

1. **Model** — add or extend an ORM model in `app/models.py`.
2. **Schema** — add the matching Pydantic v2 request/response model in `app/schemas.py`.
3. **Route** — add a RESTful route in `app/routes.py` with an explicit `response_model`,
   using `Depends(get_db)` for database access.
4. **Migration** — generate and apply the schema change:
   ```bash
   uv run alembic revision --autogenerate -m "add <feature>"
   uv run alembic upgrade head
   ```
5. **Frontend helper** — add a typed function in `apps/web/lib/api.ts` for the new endpoint.
6. **Page/UI** — build the page or component using that helper, with loading and error
   states; add shadcn primitives via the CLI if needed.
7. **Run the checks** — backend (`uv run ty check`, `uv run ruff check .`,
   `uv run ruff format --check .`) and frontend (`pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`).
8. **Update docs** — if you changed structure/build/run, update `AGENTS.md` and
   `Setup.md` (and `README.md` if the overview changed).

---

## 17. Bug-Fix Workflow

1. **Reproduce** the bug (hit the endpoint, load the page, or observe the failing check).
2. **Locate** it using the one-file-per-responsibility layout — follow the request from
   `main.py` → `routes.py`/`health.py` → `schemas.py` → `db.py`/`models.py` on the backend,
   or from `app/page.tsx` → `lib/api.ts` on the frontend.
3. **Fix** the smallest thing that resolves the issue, preserving types and conventions.
4. **Run the checks** ([§8](#8-type-checking--linting)) and confirm they all pass.
5. **Update docs** if the fix changed structure, build, or run steps.

---

## 18. Definition of Done

A change is done when **all** of the following hold:

- **All backend static checks pass** within `apps/api`:
  - `uv run ty check` → zero type errors
  - `uv run ruff check .` → zero lint errors
  - `uv run ruff format --check .` → all files formatted
- **All frontend static checks pass** within `apps/web`:
  - `pnpm lint` → zero lint errors
  - `pnpm typecheck` → zero type errors
- **`AGENTS.md` and `Setup.md` (and `README.md` where relevant) are updated** if the
  change altered how the repository is structured, built, or run.
- **No test setup was added** — this template intentionally ships without one.

---

## 19. Agentic Coding Principles

These principles guide how an agent (or human) should approach changes in this repository.
They are adapted from [Andrej Karpathy's agentic coding guide](https://github.com/multica-ai/andrej-karpathy-skills/blob/main/CLAUDE.md)
and reframed to fit this template — most importantly, its verification loop is built on
**static checks, not tests** (this template has no testing setup; see
[§1](#1-purpose), [§8](#8-type-checking--linting), and [§14](#14-prohibited-actions)).

1. **Think before coding.** Make your assumptions explicit before writing code. When a
   request could be read more than one way, surface the alternatives rather than silently
   committing to one. Favor the simpler path, and say so when a requested approach seems
   heavier than the problem needs. If something is genuinely unclear, pause and ask instead
   of guessing.
2. **Simplicity first.** Write only the code the task actually needs. Skip speculative
   features, avoid abstractions for code that has a single caller, do not add
   configuration nobody asked for, and do not guard against scenarios that cannot occur.
   This mirrors the template's "small, flat, explicit" principle (see
   [§3](#3-core-principles)).
3. **Surgical changes.** Touch only what the task requires. Leave adjacent code alone — do
   not "improve" or reformat lines unrelated to your change, and match the surrounding
   style. Clean up only the loose ends your own edit creates; if you spot pre-existing dead
   code, mention it rather than deleting it as a drive-by.
4. **Goal-driven execution.** Turn each task into a concrete, verifiable goal and keep
   iterating until it is met. **Verification in this repository is the static checks, not
   tests** — back end `uv run ty check` / `uv run ruff check .` /
   `uv run ruff format --check .`, and front end `pnpm lint` / `pnpm typecheck` (see
   [§8](#8-type-checking--linting)). Loop on those checks until they all pass; that is the
   success criterion. Do **not** write tests or add a test setup to satisfy this loop (see
   [§14](#14-prohibited-actions)).
