# AGENTS.md

## Scope

- This file applies to the repository root: `/home/jdide/path/siigo-mcp`.
- The project is a Node 18+ TypeScript MCP server for the Siigo API.
- Runtime entrypoint: `src/index.ts`.
- Main client implementation: `src/siigo-client.ts`.
- Shared API contracts: `src/types.ts`.
- Tests currently live in `test/*.test.js` and run against built output in `dist/`.

## Agent Priorities

- Keep changes small and targeted.
- Preserve the existing public API shape unless the task explicitly requires a breaking change.
- Prefer extending existing patterns over introducing new abstractions.
- Do not add new tooling unless the task calls for it.
- Do not invent lint or formatter rules that are not already implied by the codebase.

## Repository Facts

- Package manager: `pnpm` (`packageManager: pnpm@10.32.0`).
- Module system: ESM (`"type": "module"`).
- TypeScript config is strict (`"strict": true`).
- Local source imports use explicit `.js` extensions because TS compiles to Node ESM.
- Jest is configured through `jest.config.cjs` with `testEnvironment: 'node'`.
- Jest matches `**/test/**/*.test.js`.
- Tests import from `../dist/...`, so the project must be built before tests are reliable.
- Linting and formatting are handled by Biome through `biome.json`.
- Repo lint script: `pnpm lint`.
- Repo format scripts: `pnpm format` and `pnpm format:write`.
- No Prettier or ESLint config files exist today.
- No Cursor rules were found in `.cursor/rules/` or `.cursorrules`.
- No Copilot instructions were found in `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.

## Setup

- Install dependencies: `pnpm install`
- Build once before running tests: `pnpm build`
- Start compiled server: `pnpm start`
- Run dev entrypoint with TS directly: `pnpm dev`

## Build, Test, and Verification Commands

- Build: `pnpm build`
- Lint: `pnpm lint`
- Auto-fix lint and formatting issues where safe: `pnpm lint:fix`
- Check formatting only: `pnpm format`
- Rewrite files with configured formatting: `pnpm format:write`
- Clean build output: `pnpm clean`
- Full test suite: `pnpm test`
- Start compiled server: `pnpm start`
- Run the TypeScript entrypoint directly: `pnpm dev`

## Single-Test Commands

- Run one test file after building:
  - `pnpm build && node --experimental-vm-modules ./node_modules/jest/bin/jest.js test/siigo-client.test.js`
- Run one named test after building:
  - `pnpm build && node --experimental-vm-modules ./node_modules/jest/bin/jest.js test/siigo-client.test.js -t "searchProducts scans later pages before filtering partial matches"`
- Run tests matching a pattern after building:
  - `pnpm build && node --experimental-vm-modules ./node_modules/jest/bin/jest.js -t "SiigoApiError"`

## Important Verification Notes

- `pnpm test` already builds first.
- Because tests import from `dist/`, source-only edits are not enough; rebuild before asserting test results.
- In the current checkout, `pnpm build` fails if dependencies are not installed because `tsc` is missing from `node_modules`.
- If `node_modules` is absent, run `pnpm install` before any build or test command.
- `pnpm lint` runs Biome across `src`, `test`, and key config files.
- `pnpm lint:fix` applies safe Biome fixes and formatting changes.

## Code Organization

- `src/index.ts` wires environment config, MCP server creation, tool registration, and tool-level error formatting.
- `src/siigo-client.ts` owns HTTP behavior, authentication, pagination helpers, endpoint methods, and API error translation.
- `src/types.ts` holds the shared TypeScript model layer for Siigo request and response shapes.
- `test/siigo-client.test.js` uses Jest ESM mocks and tests the compiled client API.

## Style Guidelines

## Formatting

- Use 2-space indentation.
- Use semicolons.
- Use single quotes.
- Biome is configured to enforce the shared formatting baseline.
- Keep trailing commas where the surrounding code already uses them.
- Prefer multiline object literals and function calls when argument lists are long.
- Follow the existing section-divider comment style when touching large files, but do not add decorative comments unnecessarily.

## Imports

- Group external imports before local imports.
- Keep local imports relative.
- Use explicit `.js` extensions in local imports from TypeScript source, for example `./siigo-client.js`.
- Import TypeScript types using the existing style in the file; this repo currently mixes value and type imports in one statement and does not require `import type`.
- Avoid introducing barrel files unless there is a clear repository-wide need.

## Types

- Maintain strict TypeScript compatibility.
- Prefer explicit interfaces and type aliases for API contracts.
- Use `unknown` instead of `any` when the value is not yet narrowed.
- Narrow errors with runtime checks such as `error instanceof Error` or `axios.isAxiosError(error)`.
- Use `Partial<T>` for partial update payloads when that matches the endpoint behavior.
- Use `Record<string, unknown>` for flexible object payloads instead of loose `object` typing.
- Preserve snake_case fields when they mirror the external Siigo API schema.
- Use camelCase for internal variables, helpers, methods, and config properties.

## Naming Conventions

- Classes: `PascalCase`.
- Interfaces and types: `PascalCase`.
- Functions and methods: `camelCase`.
- Local variables and params: `camelCase`.
- Constants: `camelCase` unless they are true exported constants.
- MCP tool names: lowercase snake_case strings prefixed with `siigo_`.
- API payload properties should match Siigo field names exactly, even when that means snake_case.

## Error Handling

- Translate API failures into `SiigoApiError` when a structured Siigo response exists.
- Preserve upstream status codes and response payloads when available.
- Fall back to plain `Error` with useful context when the failure is not a structured API error.
- At the MCP tool layer, catch errors and return `errorResult(...)` instead of letting handlers throw raw exceptions.
- Include response detail in tool output only through the established `errorResult` pattern.
- Do not silently swallow errors.

## MCP and API Patterns

- Register new MCP tools through `server.registerTool(...)` in `src/index.ts`.
- Define input schemas with Zod and add `.describe(...)` text for user-facing fields.
- Set `annotations.readOnlyHint` and `annotations.destructiveHint` accurately.
- Prefer reusing `jsonResult(...)` and `errorResult(...)` instead of creating new response wrappers.
- Put HTTP endpoint logic in `SiigoClient`, not in the tool registration layer.
- Keep tool handlers thin: validate input, call client method, wrap result.
- When adding a new endpoint, add both the client method and the MCP tool registration unless the task explicitly scopes only one layer.

## Testing Conventions

- Existing tests use `@jest/globals` imports, ESM mocking, and `await import(...)` for compiled modules.
- Keep tests focused on observable behavior, request paths, pagination logic, and error translation.
- Prefer mocking the Axios instance rather than making real network calls.
- Reset mocks in `beforeEach`.
- If you change runtime exports used by tests, ensure the corresponding `dist/` path remains valid after build.

## When Editing

- Update `README.md` or `USAGE.md` only when behavior, commands, or supported tools change materially.
- Keep changes consistent with the very large, sectioned style of `src/index.ts`; avoid broad refactors unless requested.
- Avoid renaming public MCP tools without explicit approval.
- Avoid changing environment variable names without explicit approval.
- Prefer additive changes to the Siigo type layer over ad hoc inline object types in handlers.

## What Not To Assume

- Do not assume a lint step exists.
- Do not assume tests can run without a prior build.
- Do not assume there are hidden Cursor or Copilot instructions; none were present at analysis time.
- Do not assume CommonJS semantics; this repo is ESM-first.

## Recommended Agent Workflow

- Read the relevant area in `src/index.ts`, `src/siigo-client.ts`, and `src/types.ts` before editing.
- Make the smallest correct change.
- Build if dependencies are installed.
- Run the narrowest relevant Jest command, rebuilding first.
- Summarize any unverified steps if the environment lacks installed dependencies.
