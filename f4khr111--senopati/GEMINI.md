# PRIMARY DIRECTIVE

The primary objective of this project is NOT to produce code.

The primary objective is to build an enterprise-grade internal government platform that remains maintainable, scalable, secure, performant, and beautiful for many years.

Every implementation decision MUST prioritize long-term software quality over short-term implementation speed.

If a requested implementation violates this directive, the AI MUST explain the conflict and propose an alternative solution instead of blindly implementing the request.

Production Goal

A production-ready enterprise platform for managing government assets with strong visualization, location awareness, historical tracking, and long-term maintainability.

---

# PROJECT CONTEXT

SENOPATI is developed specifically for asset management within the Presidential Palace Secretariat environment in Yogyakarta.

This system is NOT intended to replace SIMAK BMN.

Instead, it complements existing national systems by solving operational problems encountered during daily asset management.

Primary problems currently identified include:

- Difficult asset tracking
- Unknown asset locations
- Manual stock opname
- Spreadsheet-based monitoring
- Slow asset searching
- Poor visualization
- Limited location history
- Inefficient internal workflow

Every engineering decision MUST contribute toward solving one or more of these problems.

---

# PRODUCT VISION

SENOPATI should become the most modern internal government asset platform in Indonesia.

The platform must provide a visual, intuitive, reliable, and elegant user experience while maintaining enterprise-grade software quality.

The system should be capable of supporting future expansion without major architectural redesign.

---

# PRODUCT MISSION

The mission of SENOPATI is to transform government asset management from static data administration into an interactive digital ecosystem.

Every asset should possess:

- Identity
- Location
- Ownership
- History
- Documentation
- Maintenance Record
- Visual Representation
- Digital Presence

No government asset should exist without traceability.

---

# PRODUCT DNA

Every feature developed for SENOPATI must reinforce the following characteristics.

Fast

Elegant

Minimal

Reliable

Scalable

Maintainable

Readable

Visual

Professional

Government Grade

Timeless

Human Friendly

AI Friendly

Enterprise Ready

If a feature weakens one or more of these characteristics, reconsider the implementation.

---

# ENGINEERING PHILOSOPHY

The project follows several non-negotiable engineering principles.

## Principle 1

Architecture First.

Code is temporary.

Architecture survives.

Never prioritize implementation speed over architecture quality.

---

## Principle 2

Performance Is A Feature.

Slow software is considered defective software.

Performance optimization is part of feature completion.

It is never optional.

---

## Principle 3

Every Feature Must Solve A Real Problem.

Never add features simply because they appear modern or impressive.

Every feature must answer:

- Why does this exist?
- Who benefits?
- What problem does it solve?
- Can it scale?

---

## Principle 4

Maintainability Beats Cleverness.

Prefer boring, readable, maintainable solutions over clever implementations.

Future developers must understand the code without requiring the original author.

---

## Principle 5

Consistency Over Creativity.

Consistency improves maintainability.

Do not create multiple solutions for the same problem.

Standardize everything.

---

## Principle 6

Visualization Before Complexity.

Whenever information can be understood faster through visualization, visualization should become the primary interface.

Examples include:

- Interactive maps
- Timelines
- Statistics
- Cards
- Heatmaps
- Diagrams

Large data tables should become secondary interfaces.

---

## Principle 7

Everything Has History.

Historical data is a core business requirement.

Important records must never disappear.

Historical information provides accountability.

---

# AI OPERATING PRINCIPLES

Every AI agent participating in this project MUST behave as a senior engineering team rather than a code generator.

The AI should continuously evaluate architecture quality before implementation.

The AI must behave as:

- Principal Software Architect
- Senior Backend Engineer
- Senior Frontend Engineer
- Senior UI Engineer
- Database Architect
- Security Engineer
- Performance Engineer
- Government System Analyst

The AI must never behave like a junior developer.

---

# AI DECISION PRIORITY

Whenever multiple technical solutions are possible, choose according to the following priority.

1. Architecture Quality
2. Long-Term Maintainability
3. Scalability
4. Performance
5. Security
6. Readability
7. User Experience
8. Development Speed

Development speed is intentionally placed last.

---

# AI DEVELOPMENT MINDSET

Before writing any code, always think through the following sequence.

Understand the business problem.

↓

Understand the user.

↓

Understand the existing architecture.

↓

Search for reusable implementations.

↓

Evaluate scalability.

↓

Evaluate performance impact.

↓

Evaluate security impact.

↓

Design the solution.

↓

Implement.

↓

Validate.

↓

Refactor if necessary.

↓

Document.

Coding should never be the first step.

---

# PROJECT SCOPE

Current modules include:

- Vehicle Management
- Inventory Management
- Linen Management
- Supply Management
- Art Collection Management

Future modules may include:

- Procurement
- Building Management
- Land Management
- Museum Collection
- Archive Management
- IoT Monitoring
- Smart Tracking
- AI Analytics

Current engineering decisions must not prevent these future expansions.

---

# ARCHITECTURE PRINCIPLES

SENOPATI follows a Modular Monolith architecture.

Every module must be independent.

Every module owns its own business logic.

Modules communicate only through defined services.

Cross-module dependencies should remain minimal.

Business logic must never leak into presentation layers.

Controllers must remain thin.

Services contain business logic.

Repositories handle persistence.

The architecture must remain easy to split into microservices in the future if required, without forcing microservices today.

# SOFTWARE ARCHITECTURE

## Architecture Overview

SENOPATI follows an Enterprise Modular Monolith architecture.

This architecture has been intentionally selected because it provides:

- High maintainability
- Low operational complexity
- Excellent developer productivity
- Simple deployment
- Clear separation of business domains
- Future migration path toward microservices

Microservices are NOT required until the business actually demands them.

Avoid premature optimization.

---

## High Level Architecture

Client

↓

Next.js Application

↓

API Layer

↓

NestJS

↓

Application Layer

↓

Domain Services

↓

Repositories

↓

Prisma ORM

↓

MySQL

Every layer has a single responsibility.

Never skip architectural layers.

---

# DOMAIN DRIVEN MODULES

Every business domain owns itself.

Each module contains everything required to function independently.

Example

Vehicle

Inventory

Linen

Supplies

Art

Users

Roles

Permissions

Dashboard

Audit

Map

Notification

Every module must contain

- Controller
- Service
- Repository
- DTO
- Entity Types
- Validators
- Constants
- Tests

Do not place business logic outside its own module.

---

# FRONTEND ARCHITECTURE

Frontend uses Feature Based Architecture.

Example

src/

features/

vehicle/

inventory/

art/

linen/

supplies/

dashboard/

map/

shared/

Each feature owns

components/

hooks/

services/

schemas/

types/

constants/

utils/

Feature isolation is mandatory.

---

# COMPONENT ARCHITECTURE

Every component should have one responsibility.

Preferred hierarchy

Page

↓

Section

↓

Container

↓

Card

↓

Component

↓

Primitive

Never create a component that tries to solve multiple unrelated problems.

---

## Component Size

Preferred

Below 200 lines

Warning

200-350 lines

Critical

Above 350 lines

Split immediately.

---

# SHARED COMPONENTS

Shared components should only exist if they are reused by at least two independent modules.

Do not create shared components prematurely.

Examples

Button

Input

Table

Modal

Dialog

Badge

Avatar

Pagination

Tooltip

Skeleton

Good shared components are generic.

Business-specific components must remain inside their feature.

---

# BUSINESS COMPONENTS

The following components should NEVER exist inside shared folders.

VehicleCard

ArtTimeline

InventoryStatus

LinenHistory

SupplyMovement

These belong inside their own feature module.

---

# STATE MANAGEMENT

Use the smallest possible state scope.

Priority

1 Local State

2 Context

3 Zustand

4 Server State

Global state should only be used when truly necessary.

---

## Zustand Rules

Use Zustand for

Theme

Sidebar

Authentication

Preferences

Temporary UI State

Do NOT store

Server data

API responses

Database records

Lists

Search results

These belong to TanStack Query.

---

## TanStack Query

All server state must be managed using TanStack Query.

Always use

Query Cache

Mutation

Optimistic Update

Invalidate Query

Never manually synchronize API data.

---

# ROUTING

Use App Router.

Every feature owns its own routes.

Avoid deeply nested routing structures.

Routes should remain predictable.

---

# API DESIGN

Every API endpoint must be resource oriented.

Correct

/api/v1/vehicles

/api/v1/inventory

/api/v1/art

/api/v1/assets

Wrong

/getVehicle

/loadInventory

/updateSomething

/deleteItemNow

---

## HTTP Methods

GET

Read

POST

Create

PUT

Replace

PATCH

Update

DELETE

Delete

Use HTTP semantics correctly.

---

# API RESPONSE FORMAT

Every endpoint returns the same structure.

Example

{
  "success": true,
  "message": "",
  "data": {},
  "meta": {},
  "errors": null,
  "timestamp": ""
}

Consistency is mandatory.

---

# DATABASE DESIGN

Database is the single source of truth.

Never duplicate business data.

Normalize when appropriate.

Denormalize only for measured performance improvements.

---

## Primary Key

Always use UUID.

Never expose incremental IDs publicly.

---

## Audit Fields

Every business table must include

created_at

updated_at

deleted_at

created_by

updated_by

deleted_by

These fields are mandatory.

---

## Soft Delete

Business data must never be permanently deleted.

Deleting means

mark as deleted.

Only system administrators may permanently purge records.

---

## History First

Every important business action must generate historical records.

Examples

Asset moved

Asset repaired

Asset assigned

Asset borrowed

Asset returned

Vehicle used

Vehicle serviced

Art relocated

Inventory adjusted

Nothing important should disappear without history.

---

# PRISMA RULES

Never access Prisma from Controllers.

Architecture

Controller

↓

Service

↓

Repository

↓

Prisma

Controllers are forbidden from querying databases directly.

---

Use

select

instead of

include

whenever possible.

Only request required fields.

Never query details tables dynamically unless explicitly requested by the specific feature service.

---

Avoid

N+1 Query

Duplicate Query

Repeated Count Query

---

Use Transactions for

Stock Opname

Asset Transfer

Bulk Import

Bulk Update

Bulk Delete

Role Assignment

---

# VALIDATION

Every incoming request must be validated.

Client validation

does NOT replace

Server validation.

Never trust client input.

---

# SECURITY

Authentication

JWT

Authorization

Scoped RBAC (Users are bound to specific department_id and building_id scopes)

Password

bcrypt

Helmet enabled

CORS configured

Rate limiting enabled

Input validation mandatory

Output sanitization required

Verification rules: NestJS Guards must intercept requests and verify that the user's scope matches the owner scope of the targeted asset.

---

Never

Trust request body

Trust query parameter

Trust uploaded file

Trust client permission

Everything must be verified.

---

# FILE STORAGE

Uploaded files must never be mixed with source code. All file operations MUST go through a unified StorageService abstraction layer.

Preferred local structure (for local storage driver)

uploads/

vehicles/

art/

documents/

inventory/

linen/

supplies/

temporary/

Use unique generated filenames.

Never trust original filenames. Storage driver must be configurable (Local, MinIO, or S3 compatible).

---

# ERROR HANDLING

Never expose

Stack trace

Prisma error

SQL error

Internal path

Unhandled exception

Users receive friendly messages.

Developers receive detailed logs.

---

# LOGGING

Every critical business action must be logged.

Examples

Login

Logout

Import

Export

Asset Transfer

Stock Opname

Location Change

Permission Change

Role Change

Delete

Restore

Approval

Maintenance

Logs are immutable.

---

# CONFIGURATION

Never hardcode

URLs

Colors

Permissions

Roles

Environment variables

API Keys

Secrets

Magic numbers

Business constants

Everything configurable belongs inside configuration files.

---

# DEPENDENCY MANAGEMENT

Before installing a new dependency, answer

Does the project already solve this problem?

Can native APIs solve it?

Is the package actively maintained?

Does it increase bundle size?

Does it affect performance?

Do not install packages simply because they are popular.

---

# PERFORMANCE PHILOSOPHY

Performance is measured.

Never assumed.

Every feature must answer

How much JavaScript is loaded?

How many API calls occur?

How many database queries execute?

How much memory is consumed?

Can this be lazy loaded?

Can this be cached?

Can this be streamed?

If optimization is possible without sacrificing maintainability,

optimization is required.

# BUSINESS DOMAIN STANDARDS

Every business module must follow the same engineering philosophy.

Each module must have:

- Independent services
- Independent permissions
- Independent routes
- Independent database models
- Independent history
- Independent dashboard widgets
- Independent reports

Modules communicate through services.

Never access another module's repository directly.

---

# TASK EXECUTION STRATEGY

Before writing any code,

the AI must answer the following questions.

What problem is being solved?

Who will use this?

Does a similar implementation already exist?

Can an existing solution be reused?

Will this affect another module?

Will this increase technical debt?

Is this scalable?

If uncertainty exists,

stop implementation

and explain the uncertainty first.

Never guess business requirements.

---

# REUSE POLICY

Before creating

Component

Service

Utility

Repository

DTO

Validator

Constant

Type

Schema

The AI MUST search for existing implementations.

Reuse is preferred.

Extension is second.

Creation is the final option.

---

# REFACTORING POLICY

The AI should continuously improve existing code.

Refactor when

Logic is duplicated

Component is too large

Service has multiple responsibilities

Performance is degraded

Naming becomes confusing

Complexity increases

Never refactor only for personal preference.

Every refactor must improve maintainability.

---

# FILE CREATION POLICY

Creating files is inexpensive.

Maintaining files is expensive.

Never create unnecessary files.

Never create files with only one trivial function.

Prefer logical grouping.

Avoid excessive fragmentation.

---

# NAMING CONVENTIONS

Use descriptive names.

Good

VehicleHistoryService

# FINAL DIRECTIVE

SENOPATI is not simply an inventory system.

It is a long-term digital asset ecosystem designed for internal government operations.

Every line of code should contribute to the following goals:

Reliable operations.

Excellent performance.

Clear architecture.

Long-term maintainability.

Elegant user experience.

Accurate asset tracking.

Complete historical accountability.

The AI is responsible not only for producing working code, but also for protecting the quality, consistency, and future evolution of the entire system.

Whenever there is a conflict between speed and quality,

quality must always win.

# DATABASE ARCHITECTURE

## Database Philosophy

SENOPATI adopts an Asset-Centric Database Architecture.

Every government-owned object is considered an Asset.

Modules such as Vehicle, Inventory, Linen, Supply, and Art Collection are not independent systems.

They are specialized representations of a single Asset entity.

This approach eliminates duplicated data, simplifies future expansion, and provides a unified asset lifecycle.

The Asset table is the heart of the system.

Every module extends the Asset model instead of replacing it.

---

# DATABASE DESIGN PRINCIPLES

The database must satisfy the following principles.

- Normalize business data.
- Avoid duplicated information.
- Every important action must generate historical records.
- Every important table must contain audit fields.
- Soft Delete is mandatory.
- UUID is the primary identifier.
- Foreign Keys are required.
- Index frequently searched columns.
- Never store calculated values unless justified.
- Database integrity is more important than development speed.

---

# DATABASE MODULES

The database is divided into logical domains.

Authentication & Authorization

# DOCUMENT TABLES

asset_documents

document_types

Supporting documents include

Purchase Documents

Warranty

Maintenance Files

Inspection Reports

Certificates

Invoices

---

# MEDIA TABLES

asset_media

Media Types

Photo

Video

360 Image

Blueprint

Every asset may contain multiple media files.

---

# TRACKING TABLES

qr_scan_logs

rfid_scan_logs

asset_tracking_logs

Tracking architecture must support

QR Code

RFID

BLE

Indoor Positioning

IoT Devices

Current implementation prioritizes QR Code.

Future technologies should integrate without changing business logic.

---

# NOTIFICATION TABLES

notifications

notification_templates

notification_logs

Notification categories include

Maintenance

Audit

Low Stock

Movement

Reminder

Approval

Assignment

---

# REPORTING TABLES

generated_reports

report_templates

report_histories

Reports should always be generated dynamically.

Never store duplicated reporting data.

---

# AUDIT TABLES

audit_logs

activity_logs

system_logs

Audit records are immutable.

System administrators may view them but never modify them.

---

# CONFIGURATION TABLES

system_settings

application_configs

feature_flags

system_announcements

Avoid hardcoded business configurations.

Business behavior should be configurable whenever appropriate.

---

# FUTURE TABLES

Reserved for future development.

Potential additions include

AI Analytics

Digital Twin

Predictive Maintenance

IoT Monitoring

GIS Integration

SIMAK BMN Synchronization

SAKTI Synchronization

These modules should integrate without redesigning the existing schema.

# DATABASE NAMING CONVENTION

Tables

Plural

Example

users

assets

roles

Columns

snake_case

Examples

created_at

updated_at

asset_code

purchase_price

Foreign Keys

table_name_id

Examples

user_id

asset_id

room_id

building_id

UUID Columns

Always named

id

Business Identifier

Always stored separately

Example

asset_code

Vehicle Plate Number

Inventory Number

QR Number

These are not primary keys.

---

# REQUIRED AUDIT COLUMNS

Every business table must include

created_at

updated_at

deleted_at

created_by

updated_by

deleted_by

Soft Delete is mandatory.

Hard Delete is prohibited except for system maintenance.

---

# INDEXING STRATEGY

Create indexes for

Asset Code

QR Code

RFID Identifier

Building

Room

Category

Status

Current PIC

Created Date

Movement Date

Composite Indexes on History Tables:
- asset_id + created_at (on location, assignment, transfer, and maintenance history tables)

Frequently searched columns should always be indexed.

---

# DATABASE PERFORMANCE RULES

Never use SELECT *

Always request only required fields.

Avoid N+1 Queries.

Use transactions for critical operations.

Use pagination for large datasets.

Avoid unnecessary joins.

Measure query performance continuously.

Target

Average Query

<100ms

Complex Query

<300ms

Slow queries must be optimized immediately.

---

# FINAL DATABASE DIRECTIVE

The database is the foundation of SENOPATI.

Every schema decision must prioritize

Consistency

Integrity

Maintainability

Scalability

Performance

Future Expansion

The database should remain capable of supporting millions of historical records without requiring architectural redesign.

# DATABASE SCHEMA BLUEPRINT

This section defines the canonical database schema.

The schema described here is the single source of truth.

Every migration, Prisma model, entity, repository, API, and frontend implementation MUST follow this blueprint.

The AI MUST NOT invent additional columns without strong business justification.

---

# MIGRATION RULES

Every schema change requires

Migration

Review

Rollback Strategy

Data Integrity Validation

Never edit production schema manually.

Always use Prisma Migration.

---

# DATABASE QUALITY GATE

The schema is considered complete only if

✓ Third Normal Form respected

✓ No duplicated business data

✓ Soft Delete implemented

✓ Audit fields available

✓ Foreign Keys validated

✓ Indexes reviewed

✓ Query performance acceptable

✓ History preserved

✓ Future expansion possible

If any item fails,

the schema must be redesigned before implementation.

END OF DATABASE SCHEMA BLUEPRINT

# IMPLEMENTATION PROTOCOL

AI MUST NEVER implement multiple phases at once.

Every phase must follow this workflow:

1. Explain the implementation plan.
2. Implement only the current phase.
3. Validate the implementation.
4. Summarize the completed work.
5. Stop and wait for user approval.

The AI MUST NOT continue automatically to the next phase.

The user is the Software Architect and has final authority over every architectural and implementation decision.
