## Documentation Checklist — Required on Every PR

Every PR that ships code (not pure CI/tooling fixes) MUST include updates to
all of the following before it can be merged. The `/pr` command enforces this.

| Artifact | What to update | Where |
|---|---|---|
| `CHANGELOG.md` | Add bullet(s) under `## [Unreleased]` for every user-visible capability added, changed, or fixed | repo root |
| `AGENTS.md` — Repo Map | Add any new files; update descriptions if a file's role changed | this file |
| `AGENTS.md` — AGL API | Correct any API facts that were proven wrong (endpoints, field names, token lifetimes, headers) | this file |
| `AGENTS.md` — What NOT to Do | Add a new prohibition if a footgun was discovered | this file |
| Memory files | Record non-obvious decisions, confirmed API behaviour, or user preferences that should survive context resets | `~/.claude/projects/.../memory/` |

**Sprint / phase boundary** (when a branch completes a named sprint or phase):

- Move completed items out of `## [Unreleased]` into a dated `## [x.y.z-dev]` entry.
- Update `## [Unreleased]` → `### Targets for next sprint` with the next block of work.
- Verify the Repo Map matches every file currently in `custom_components/haggle/` and `tests/`.
- Review every bullet in the AGL API section against the current implementation — correct or delete stale facts.

## Worktree Workflow

Main worktree (`/Users/dave/projects/haggle/`) is always on `main`. Feature
work happens in sibling worktrees at `/Users/dave/projects/haggle.wt/<branch>/`.
Never commit directly to `main` from a feature worktree — always open a PR.

```bash
# Create a feature worktree
./scripts/wt new feat/agl-login

# Work in the new session:
# → open Claude Code at ../haggle.wt/feat-agl-login/

# Remove when done (refuses if dirty)
./scripts/wt rm feat/agl-login
```

Each worktree shares `.venv` and `.claude/settings.local.json` via symlink.

---

## GitHub Issues Workflow

GitHub issues are the canonical place to track non-trivial work that
isn't being done right now. This is deliberate: a CHANGELOG entry, a
memory note, or an inline `# TODO` comment all rot quickly and are
invisible to anyone who doesn't already know to look.

**Open an issue when:**
- A docs gap, chore, or process improvement is discovered mid-sprint and
  is not in scope of the current PR.
- A footgun is found that future agents need to be warned about (also
  add it to "What NOT to Do" if it's actionable).
- A code-review note is "do this next round" rather than "do this now".
- A bug reproduces but you don't have time to fix it this PR.

**Don't:**
- Use `# TODO` comments in committed code for tracking work — they have
  no due date and no owner.
- Use CHANGELOG `## [Unreleased]` as a TODO list — it ships in the next
  release notes; bullets there should describe done work.
- Use memory files for tracking — memory captures durable design
  decisions and confirmed API behaviour, not work items.

**PRs close issues explicitly.** Use `Closes #N` in the PR body so
GitHub auto-closes on merge. If a PR partially addresses an issue,
comment on the issue rather than closing it.

When mid-sprint code-review or audit work surfaces a tail of items,
spawn issues for each one and label-and-prioritise them rather than
trying to fold everything into the current PR.

## AGL API — Key Facts

### Authentication (Auth0 PKCE)

- **Auth host**: `https://secure.agl.com.au`
- **Setup grant**: `authorization_code` + PKCE (`S256`). The config flow
  generates a PKCE verifier+challenge, builds an `/authorize` URL, and shows
  it to the user. The user opens the URL in their **real browser** (handles
  Akamai bot-protection + MFA transparently), then pastes the callback URL back.
  The integration extracts the `code` and POSTs to `/oauth/token`.
  - `redirect_uri`: `https://secure.agl.com.au/ios/au.com.agl.mobile/callback`
  - `scope`: `openid profile email offline_access`
  - `audience`: `https://api.platform.agl.com.au/` (trailing slash required)
- **Ongoing grant**: `refresh_token` (stored in `entry.data`).
- **Token endpoint**: `POST /oauth/token`
- **client_id**: `2mDkNcC8gkDLL7FTT1ZxF5rrQHrLTHL3` (documented 2026-04-30)
- **Required headers**: `Client-Flavor: app.iOS.public.8.38.0-531`
- **Access token**: JWT (RS256), `exp` = **15 min** (`expires_in: 900` — confirmed 2026-05-01). Decode `exp`; refresh 2 min early.
- **CRITICAL — token rotation**: Auth0 **rotates** the refresh token on every
  exchange. The integration MUST persist the new refresh token via
  `_persist_refresh_token` callback after every exchange or it will lock
  itself out on the next restart.

### Data API

- **Base**: `https://api.platform.agl.com.au`
- **Required headers on ALL data endpoints** (documented from AGL mobile app 8.38.0-531, 2026-05-01):
  - `Client-Flavor: app.iOS.public.8.38.0-531`
  - `Client-Device: Apple-iPhone-iPhone14,7-iOS-26.4.2`
  - `Accept-Language: en-AU,en;q=0.9`
  - `Accept-Features: <long feature-flag list>` — see `AGL_ACCEPT_FEATURES` in `const.py`.
    Must include `UsageEnableHistoricalMeterReads`. **Omitting any of these headers causes
    HTTP 500 on Hourly/Daily usage endpoints** (overview and plan are more permissive).
- **`scaling` query parameter**: Hourly and Daily usage URLs require
  `&scaling=36.514404_108.057_40.670903_120.357_0_0_0_0` (screen DPI vector for chart
  rendering). Without it, the BFF returns HTTP 500.
- **Contract discovery**: `GET /mobile/bff/api/v3/overview`
  - Key fields: `accounts[].accountNumber`, `accounts[].contracts[].contractNumber`
  - `contractNumber` ≠ `accountNumber` — use `contractNumber` in all data paths
- **30-min interval data** (despite "Hourly" in the path):
  `GET /mobile/bff/api/v2/usage/smart/Electricity/{contractNumber}/Current/Hourly?period=YYYY-MM-DD_YYYY-MM-DD&scaling=...`
- **kWh source of truth**: `consumption.quantity` (outer) — matches the AGL
  portal "MyUsageData" CSV export to 0.001 kWh. Reconciled 2026-05-12 across
  11 mitm /Hourly captures.
  - **Do NOT use `consumption.values.quantity`** (inner). It's a DPI/chart-scaled
    helper (in real captures `values.amount` always equals `values.quantity`)
    that undercounts kWh by 4-73% with no consistent ratio. Reading it was the
    root cause of the v0.1.0 / v0.2.0-beta.{1,2,3} meter-undercounting bug.
- **Cost source of truth**: `consumption.amount` (outer) — AUD for the slot.
- **`dateTime` field**: slot start, in **UTC**. Convert to local for display.
- **`consumption.type`**: `normal` | `peak` | `offpeak` | `shoulder` | `none`
  (filter out `none` — future-dated or unavailable intervals)
- **Zero-on-zero filter**: AGL also returns intervals with non-`none` type
  but both `quantity` and `amount` equal to 0 for days where the AEMO feed
  hasn't yet delivered the meter reads. The parser drops these (they would
  otherwise create phantom flat rows that the resume logic would skip past
  permanently once AGL backfilled the real reads).

### Polling Cadence

| Data | Interval | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| 30-min intervals | 24 h | AGL data is delayed 24-48 h (AEMO feed lag) |
| Daily series | 6 h | Picks up newly available days |
| Plan / overview | 7 days | Rarely changes |
| Token refresh | Just-in-time (< 2 min to `exp`) | tokens expire at 15 min |

**Do not poll for today's hourly data** — it will be empty. Fetch *yesterday*.

**Trailing rewindow (self-healing)**: once initial backfill is complete, every
poll re-fetches the trailing `REWINDOW_DAYS` (default 7). This makes the
integration self-heal AGL's day-late AEMO backfills — a slot first returned as
a `quantity=0` placeholder is overwritten with the real meter read on a later
cycle. `async_add_external_statistics` is idempotent on `(statistic_id, start)`
so the overwrite is safe.

The cumulative-sum baseline for the import (aggregate AND every per-tariff
series) is looked up in `_import_intervals` via `statistics_during_period`
using the **actual earliest fetched-interval hour** as the cutoff — NOT a
`fetch_start`-derived UTC midnight, and NOT the most-recent stored sum. AGL's
`period=` query is interpreted in the contract's local timezone, so the first
interval of a day query lands at local midnight in UTC (e.g.
`(fetch_start - 1)T14:00Z` for an AEST account). A cutoff fixed at
`fetch_start T00:00Z` UTC folded ~10 h of about-to-be-overwritten old sums into
the baseline and the new chain re-added those hours' deltas, producing a phantom
`+N kWh` jump in the recorder `sum` column every local midnight (the Energy
dashboard renders hourly deltas as `sum[h] - sum[h-1]`, so the spike was
visible there). Using the earliest fetched hour is correct regardless of
timezone or DST.

The baseline lookup itself (`_baseline_sums_before`) is **two-stage**: a cheap
batched window of `look_back_days` ending at the cutoff (2 days for the
aggregate, `BACKFILL_DAYS` for per-tariff series), and — only for a series with
NO rows in that window — a reach-back lookup from the start of recorded history.
Both stages stay strictly *before* the cutoff, so neither ever reads a sum from
inside the rewindow rows about to be rewritten (this is why `get_last_statistics`
is wrong here). Without the reach-back, a ToU band absent for longer than the
window and then reappearing inside the rewindow would reset its cumulative sum to
0.0 — a downward step breaking that series' `TOTAL_INCREASING` monotonicity
(#114, fixed v0.3.2).

### Previous Bill Period

```
GET /mobile/bff/api/v2/usage/smart/Electricity/{contractNumber}/Previous/Hourly?period=YYYY-MM-DD_YYYY-MM-DD&scaling=...
```

Used for backfill of dates **before** the current billing period start (`bill_period.start`).
Confirmed working back to at least 2025-12-24 (single-day period params). Requires the same
`Accept-Features`/`Client-Device`/`scaling` headers as `Current/Hourly`.

### Plan / Rates

```
GET /mobile/bff/api/v2/plan/energy/{contractNumber}
```

Returns `gstInclusiveRates` list with `c/kWh` and `c/day` entries. Supply charge
is a `c/day` entry with `title` containing "Supply charge".

**Time-of-Use rate mapping (heuristic — needs real-capture validation)**: AGL
does not return a machine `tariffType` field on plan rates. ToU bands are
inferred from the free-text `kind:"header"` row and the per-rate `title` via a
keyword match (`parser._classify_tariff`: `shoulder` → shoulder; `off peak`/
`off-peak`/`offpeak` → offpeak; then bare `peak` → peak; anything else → None,
so unmatched bands surface as `unavailable`, never a misleading `0.0`). The
**statistics split does NOT depend on this** — it is driven entirely by the
well-documented per-interval `consumption.type`. Only the per-tariff *rate
sensors* rely on the plan-text heuristic. `tests/fixtures/tou_plan_response.json`
is shape-extrapolated from `plan_response.json` (headers "Peak"/"Shoulder"/
"Off Peak"); validate against a real ToU plan capture and correct the heuristic
if AGL labels bands differently (tracked in #90).

### TLS pinning (Trust-On-First-Use)

Both `secure.agl.com.au` and `api.platform.agl.com.au` are pinned by SPKI hash.
Capture happens inside `agl/pinning.py::HagglePinningConnector` — a
`TCPConnector` subclass that overrides `_wrap_create_connection`. After every
new TLS handshake the connector extracts the leaf-cert SPKI from
`transport.get_extra_info("ssl_object")` and stores it in `connector.observed[host]`.
An optional `on_new_connection(host, spki)` callback fires synchronously so
callers can validate against a stored TOFU pin.

The persisted hashes live in `entry.data` under `CONF_PINNED_SPKI_AUTH` and
`CONF_PINNED_SPKI_BFF`. They are read in `config_flow._exchange_code` /
`_fetch_contracts` (each uses a one-shot `aiohttp.ClientSession(connector=…)`
and reads `connector.observed[host]` after the call) and validated at runtime
by the long-lived session in `__init__.py::async_setup_entry`.

**Mismatch is warn-only** — log a WARNING + emit an HA persistent notification
(`haggle_pin_mismatch_<host>`) — but the request still succeeds. This keeps a
legitimate AGL cert rotation from bricking HACS users; the documented
remediation is to re-run Reconfigure on the integration card, which re-captures
both hashes.

Empty stored values (`""`) mean "no pin yet" — the validator is a no-op.
Older entries created before this feature land in this state and silently
upgrade on next Reconfigure.

**Why a connector subclass and not `resp.connection`?** aiohttp releases the
`Connection` back to its pool the moment a response is constructed, so
`resp.connection` (and `resp._protocol.transport`) are already `None` by the
time `async with session.get(...) as resp:` enters. The first cut of TOFU
pinning shipped with that bug — every live install was running with empty
SPKI strings (verified 2026-05-03) — until the connector subclass redesign.
Tests must use a real local TLS server (see `tests/test_pinning.py`); mocking
`resp.connection` will not catch this lifecycle issue.

## Energy Dashboard Contract

The HA Energy dashboard requires:
- `device_class = ENERGY`, `state_class = TOTAL_INCREASING`, `native_unit_of_measurement = kWh`
- Historical data MUST be fed via `async_add_external_statistics()` (not live state updates).
  AGL data is always historical — the recorder writes it to the correct UTC hour slot
  regardless of when the API call happened. Skipping this means the Energy dashboard shows
  a spike at poll time, not a smooth historical chart.
- Statistic IDs per contract:
  - `haggle:consumption_<contract_number>` — kWh, `has_sum=True`, **`unit_class="energy"`**
  - `haggle:cost_<contract_number>` — AUD, `has_sum=True`, `unit_class=None`
- **`unit_class="energy"` is required** on the consumption statistic for it to appear in
  the Energy dashboard's "add consumption source" picker. `unit_class=None` silently excludes
  it from the UI filter even though the data is in the DB.
- **Time-of-Use (ToU) per-tariff series**: on a contract whose interval data carries
  `consumption.type` values other than `normal` (i.e. `peak`/`offpeak`/`shoulder`), the
  coordinator ALSO writes one series per tariff type present, named band-distinctly:
  - `haggle:consumption_<tariff>_<contract_number>` — kWh, `unit_class="energy"`, `has_sum=True`
  - `haggle:cost_<tariff>_<contract_number>` — AUD, `unit_class=None`, `has_sum=True`

  where `<tariff> ∈ {peak, offpeak, shoulder, normal}`. The per-tariff series sum back to
  the aggregate (the `normal`/anytime band is included precisely so no kWh is lost). The
  aggregate series is always written too, for backward compatibility.
  - **Double-count warning**: a ToU user must add ONLY the per-tariff consumption series to
    the Energy dashboard, NOT the aggregate `haggle:consumption_<contract>` as well — adding
    both counts every kWh twice. Flat-rate users add only the aggregate (no per-tariff series
    exist for them). Each band uses a stable, band-labelled `StatisticMetaData.name`
    (`TARIFF_LABELS` in `const.py`) so the picker can tell them apart.
- Resume point: `get_last_statistics(hass, 1, stat_id, True, {"start", "sum"})` — returns
  the last-imported hour so incremental updates don't re-import already-stored rows.
- Each import call is idempotent: `(statistic_id, start)` updates in place.

---

## What NOT to Do

- **No `requests`** — always `aiohttp`. Blocking I/O in the event loop will freeze HA.
- **No blocking I/O in the coordinator** — `_async_update_data` must be fully async.
- **No OTP/portal flow** — auth is PKCE via the user's real browser, not portal scraping.
- **No hardcoded contract numbers** — they come from `/v3/overview` at config time.
- **No polling faster than 24 h for interval data** — AGL won't have newer data.
- **Don't store `access_token` in `entry.data`** — it's transient (15 min).
  Persist only `refresh_token` to `entry.data`; keep `access_token` in memory only.
- **Don't use `async_add_executor_job`** for AGL API calls — they're already async.
- **Don't pass `access_token` to `AglAuth`** — `AglAuth.__init__` expects a `refresh_token`.
  Passing an `access_token` silently fails: `async_force_refresh` posts it as a refresh_token,
  Auth0 rejects it, and the contract number is never set → HTTP 404 on every data call.
  For one-shot calls with a bare bearer token (e.g. config flow), use a direct `aiohttp` GET.
- **Don't omit `Accept-Features` / `Client-Device` / `scaling`** — omitting any of these
  from Hourly or Daily usage requests returns HTTP 500 with no useful error body.
- **Don't set `unit_class=None` on the consumption statistic** — HA's Energy dashboard
  consumption picker filters by `unit_class="energy"`. `None` silently hides the statistic.
- **Don't add BOTH the aggregate and the per-tariff consumption series to the Energy
  dashboard for one ToU contract** — they overlap (per-tariff series are a partition of the
  aggregate), so adding both double-counts every kWh. The integration writes both for
  backward compatibility; the docs/CHANGELOG tell ToU users to add only the per-tariff
  series and flat-rate users to add only the aggregate. When adding a new per-tariff series,
  always emit the `normal`/anytime band too (`TOU_SERIES_TARIFFS`) so the partition is
  complete and no kWh silently vanishes from the breakdown.
- **No committing directly to `main`** — the `guard-main-branch` hook blocks it.
  Use a feature branch + PR.
- **No mutable GitHub Action refs** — pin every `uses: owner/action@…` to a
  40-char commit SHA with a `# vX.Y` comment. `@main`, `@master`, and floating
  major tags (`@v6`) are all branch-poisonable supply-chain vectors. Dependabot
  (`github-actions` ecosystem) keeps the SHAs current.
- **Don't surface raw AGL/Auth0 response bodies in exceptions** that propagate
  to `ConfigEntryAuthFailed` / `UpdateFailed`. They reach HA Persistent
  Notifications and `home-assistant.log` at ERROR level. Auth0 5xx/429 bodies
  can include diagnostic fields (`mfa_token`, internal trace IDs); AGL BFF URLs
  carry the contract number (PII). Pattern:
  `_LOGGER.debug("…body: %s", text[:200]); raise AGLError(f"HTTP {status} …")`.
- **Don't use unbounded `float()` coercion on AGL response values**. Use the
  `_safe_float` helpers in `agl/parser.py` / `coordinator.py` so `inf`/`nan`/
  negative values can't reach `async_add_external_statistics` and corrupt the
  cumulative-sum series.
- **Don't forward raw AGL response dicts** via `dict(rate)` or similar
  open-schema passthrough. Allowlist exactly the fields the coordinator
  consumes, so a MITM-crafted response can't smuggle keys into runtime state.
- **Don't read kWh from `consumption.values.quantity` (inner).** That's a
  DPI/chart-scaled helper, not the meter read; in real captures `values.amount`
  always equals `values.quantity` and both undercount real consumption by
  4-73% with no consistent ratio. Read `consumption.quantity` (outer) for kWh
  and `consumption.amount` (outer) for AUD. Confirmed against the AGL portal
  "MyUsageData" CSV across 11 mitm captures, 2026-05-12. Regression test:
  `tests/test_parser.py::TestParseIntervalReadings::test_uses_outer_consumption_quantity_not_inner_values`.
- **Don't write `quantity == 0 && amount == 0` intervals to statistics.** AGL
  returns these as placeholders on days where the AEMO feed hasn't yet
  delivered the meter reads (with a non-`none` type, even). Inserting them
  creates phantom flat rows that the resume logic skips past forever once AGL
  backfills the real reads. `parse_interval_readings` filters them.
- **Don't put `AGL` (or any close variant) in `DeviceInfo.manufacturer`.**
  HA's "Service info" card renders `model by manufacturer`; this is an
  unofficial third-party integration and labelling the device as if AGL
  Energy authored it is misleading and a possible trademark concern. Keep
  `manufacturer="Haggle"`. AGL's name belongs only in `model`/docs as a
  factual description of the upstream service. Regression test:
  `tests/test_init.py::test_device_info_does_not_claim_agl_authorship`.
- **Don't pair `state_class=MEASUREMENT` with `device_class=MONETARY`.**
  HA validates this combination and logs a WARNING on every state update;
  only `None` or `TOTAL` are valid for MONETARY. Use `TOTAL` for cumulative
  cost-over-period, leave unset for one-shot forecasts.
- **Don't use `device_class=MONETARY` for unit prices.** MONETARY is for
  cumulative amounts (`$87.38 of cost so far`), not rates (`$0.34/kWh`).
  Pair the rate sensor with `state_class=MEASUREMENT` and a unit string
  like `"AUD/kWh"` instead — HA's price-tracking integrations (Nordpool,
  Tibber) follow the same pattern. Mixing MONETARY with no `state_class`
  *also* triggers HA's `state_class_removed` Repair if the entity ever
  reported stats under an earlier release.
- **Implement `async_remove_entry` if the integration creates entities.**
  Otherwise deleting the integration leaves orphan entity-registry rows
  whose `config_entry_id` references the now-gone entry; reinstall causes
  `_2`-suffixed sensor IDs that linger as `unavailable` forever. See
  `__init__.py::async_remove_entry`.
- **Don't clear the `haggle:*` external statistics in `async_remove_entry`.**
  Those rows are the user's own historical energy/cost data; deleting them on
  uninstall would silently and unrecoverably destroy years of Energy-dashboard
  history. Orphaned statistics are harmless and the user can prune them via
  Developer Tools → Statistics. Decided won't-implement on #91 (v0.3.2);
  `async_remove_entry` documents the deliberate omission. Do not add
  `async_clear_statistics` here without an explicit opt-in.
- **Don't fire backfill requests in a tight loop.** AGL's BFF will 429
  if 7 sequential GETs land in <1 s. `_fetch_range` sleeps
  `BACKFILL_INTER_REQUEST_DELAY` between days and breaks out of the chunk
  on `AGLRateLimitError`; the next 24 h cycle resumes from the gap.
- **Don't derive the cumulative-sum baseline cutoff from a `fetch_start` UTC
  midnight.** AGL's `period=YYYY-MM-DD_YYYY-MM-DD` query is interpreted in the
  contract's LOCAL timezone, so the first interval returned lands at local
  midnight in UTC (e.g. `(fetch_start - 1)T14:00Z` for AEST). A baseline lookup
  cut off at `fetch_start T00:00Z` folds ~10 h of about-to-be-overwritten old
  sums into the baseline; the new chain re-adds those hours' deltas, producing
  a phantom `+N kWh` jump in the recorder `sum` column every local-midnight UTC
  row (visible on the Energy dashboard, which plots `sum[h] - sum[h-1]`).
  `_import_intervals` looks the baseline up — for the aggregate AND every
  per-tariff series — at the **actual earliest fetched-interval hour**, which
  is correct regardless of timezone or DST. This is why baselines are resolved
  AFTER the fetch (inside `_import_intervals`), not before it. Regression test:
  `tests/test_coordinator_statistics.py::TestImportIntervalsAggregation::test_baseline_looked_up_at_earliest_fetched_hour`.
  Fixed v0.3.0 → confirmed against the live recorder: 8 phantom spikes at
  `T14:00Z` (AEST local midnight) of 10–27 kWh each, including in the ToU
  `consumption_normal` series.

## Contributing — Adding a New Endpoint

To add support for a new AGL API endpoint:

1. **Identify the endpoint contract** from your own AGL account. Any standard
   HTTP-debugging tool of your choice is fine — you only need the resulting URL
   path, required headers, and JSON response shape.
2. **Anonymise before committing**: redact `accountNumber`, `contractNumber`,
   address, product code, and any meter-read timeseries that fingerprint a real
   residence. Use the placeholders in `tests/fixtures/overview_response.json`
   as the canonical set (`1234567890` / `9999999999` / `1 Sample Street SUBURB QLD 4000`).
3. Add an anonymised fixture under `tests/fixtures/<name>_response.json`.
4. Add a parser in `agl/parser.py` and a corresponding `AglClient` method in
   `agl/client.py`.
5. Add tests against the fixture. Do not commit any captures with real customer
   values.

## Commit Conventions

Conventional Commits format is enforced by `commitlint` pre-commit hook:

```
feat: add daily consumption sensor
fix: handle missing consumption.quantity
chore(release): v0.2.0
ci: add hacs workflow
```

Every commit MUST include the `Co-Authored-By: Claude` trailer. The
`require-claude-coauthor` pre-commit hook enforces this. Example:

```bash
git commit -m "feat: implement token rotation persistence

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"
```

## Provenance

This codebase was generated by AI (Claude, Anthropic) and reviewed by the human
maintainer (@naanyabiz). All commits carry `Co-Authored-By: Claude` trailers.
The integration is built against the API responses returned to a legitimate AGL
customer using AGL's own mobile client endpoints. No proprietary AGL code is
included. Anonymised response shapes are mirrored under `tests/fixtures/`; the
full API contract is documented in the "AGL API — Key Facts" section above.
