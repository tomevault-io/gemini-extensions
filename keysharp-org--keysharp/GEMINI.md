# Keysharp — Claude Code Guide

## Project overview

Keysharp is a cross-platform C# implementation of AutoHotkey v2. AHK scripts (`.ahk`/`.ks`) are parsed by a hand-written lexer + recursive-descent parser into an AST, lowered to C# (Roslyn `SyntaxNode`s), compiled in-memory with Roslyn, and executed as a .NET assembly. The parser and compiler are optional first-party deployment units, so compiled scripts can run with the runtime alone. The goal is full AHK v2 compatibility on Windows, with partial Linux and eventual macOS support.

## Build

Target framework is **net10.0** (net10.0-windows on Windows). Platform is **AnyCPU** everywhere, on every OS.

Nothing needs a machine type in the managed assemblies: native dependencies are resolved at runtime through
the RID graph in `deps.json`, the x64-only DllCall register shim is guarded by a `ProcessArchitecture` check,
and scripts are Roslyn-compiled as AnyCpu. So architecture is chosen with **`-r <rid>`**, never `-p:Platform`
— a RID-less `dotnet build` simply takes the apphost matching the SDK doing the building, which is what makes
the same checkout work on x64 and on Windows on ARM.

```bash
dotnet build Keysharp.sln -c Debug                       # runnable on this machine, whatever its arch
dotnet publish Keysharp/Keysharp.csproj -c Release -r win-x64
dotnet publish Keysharp/Keysharp.csproj -c Release -r win-arm64
```

Scripts can branch on architecture with the predefined `X64` / `ARM64` / `X86` / `ARM` preprocessor symbols,
or at runtime via `#Import Ks { A_ProcessArch, A_OSArch }`. Use those rather than `A_PtrSize`, which is 8 for
both x64 and ARM64.

```bash
# Windows — from repo root
dotnet build Keysharp.sln -c Debug

# Linux — requires sibling Eto fork cloned at ../Eto
# git clone -b Keysharp https://github.com/keysharp-org/Eto.git ../Eto
dotnet build Keysharp.sln -c Debug
```

Build output lands in `bin/Debug/net10.0-windows/` (or the appropriate TFM subfolder) due to `Directory.Build.props`.

## Run a script

```bash
# Windows
./bin/Debug/net10.0-windows/Keysharp.exe myscript.ahk

# Useful flags
--transpile          # emit generated C# alongside the script and exit (great for debugging transpiler)
--validate           # compile-check only, do not run
--compile exe        # emit a standalone .exe and exit
--compile exe-min    # like exe, with dependencies embedded
--compile asm        # emit a .cks assembly beside the script and exit; several scripts may follow,
                     #   each compiled beside its own source, sharing one warm compiler
--dest <path>        # send --compile's output to <path> (or * for stdout); one output, so one script
```

> **Important**: a script an agent runs must never be able to block on a dialog unless the user has explicitly opted in. A load-time warning or an uncaught runtime error opens a modal window on the user's desktop that nothing in this environment can dismiss, and it leaves an orphaned `Keysharp.exe` behind. Before running a script:
>
> - Put `#ErrorStdOut` at the top of it. The directive sends any syntax error that prevents the script from launching — and any uncaught runtime error — to the standard error stream (stderr) rather than displaying a dialog.
> - The `--errorstdout` / `/ErrorStdOut` command-line switch does the same for load-time errors only; it does **not** suppress runtime error dialogs, so it is not a substitute for the directive.
> - `#Warn` warnings show their own dialog, which `#ErrorStdOut` does not suppress, and `VarUnset`/`Unreachable` are on by default. Add `#Warn All, StdOut` to keep them visible without a dialog.
> - The same applies to whatever the script itself blocks on: `MsgBox`, `InputBox`, `FileSelect`, a modal `Gui`. Use `--validate` when a compile check is all that is needed.

## Tests

The test suite uses **NUnit 4** and is serialized (`LevelOfParallelism(1)`) because tests share `Script.TheScript` global state. Do not add `[Parallelizable]` attributes.

```bash
# Run the curated subset (safe, no user-input required — matches CI)
dotnet test Keysharp.Tests/Keysharp.Tests.csproj -c Debug --nologo \
  --filter "(Category=Assign|Category=BuiltInVars|Category=Class|Category=Collections|Category=Curated|Category=Directives|Category=Flow|Category=Function|Category=Hotstring|Category=Math|Category=Misc|Category=Module|Category=Operator|Category=Parser|Category=String|Category=Types|Category=FileAndDir|Category=Network|FullyQualifiedName~ClipboardTests.CfHtml|FullyQualifiedName~ClipboardTests.UriListParsing|FullyQualifiedName~ClipboardTests.OnChangeHook) & Category!=RequiresHook"

# Run a specific category
dotnet test Keysharp.Tests/Keysharp.Tests.csproj --filter "Category=Math"

# Run a single test
dotnet test Keysharp.Tests/Keysharp.Tests.csproj --filter "FullyQualifiedName~MathTests.Abs"
```

> **Important**: The full `dotnet test` run (without `--filter`) includes tests that require interactive GUI or elevated permissions and will block waiting for user input. Always use the curated filter above (or a narrower category filter) when running tests locally. The same filter is used in CI (`.github/workflows/curated-tests.yml`).

> **Important**: Do not run commands to build parts of the project and run tests at the same time.

> **Run as few tests as possible, as rarely as possible.** The curated subset takes minutes; running it after every edit wastes far more time than it saves. Pick the narrowest thing that could actually catch a regression in what you changed, and run it **once, at the end** — not after each step of a multi-part change.
> - **No test run at all** for changes that cannot alter behavior: comments, XML docs, whitespace, renaming a local, `.md` files. A build is enough to prove those still compile, and often even that is unnecessary.
> - **One targeted test** (`--filter "FullyQualifiedName~SomeTests.Method"`) while iterating on a specific fix.
> - **One category** (`--filter "Category=Misc"`) for a change confined to that area.
> - **The full curated subset** only once the change is finished, or before handing work over — not as a progress check.
>
> The same applies to builds: prefer `-t:Compile` to check syntax without touching the output tree, and do not rebuild after an edit that only touched comments.

Test `.ahk` scripts live in `Keysharp.Tests/Code/`. Script-visible behavior is tested through `TestScript("script-name", true/false)`, which compiles and runs the matching `.ahk` file and checks for `PASS` in output. Direct C# tests are reserved for deterministic internal contracts that cannot safely be reached through a script and are marked `Category("Internal")`.

See `Keysharp.Tests/TESTING.md` for the test-boundary, naming, and category conventions.

`TestRunner.SetupBeforeEachTest` resets global state before each test. `CleanupAfterEachTest` disposes the `Script` object.

## Architecture: how a script runs

1. Core discovers the fixed first-party `parser` or `compiler` unit below `components/scripting` when its capability is requested.
2. `Lexing.Lexer` in `Keysharp.Components.Scripting.Parser` tokenizes the source; `Syntax.Parser.ParseWithDiagnostics()` builds the strongly-typed AST (`ProgramNode`).
3. `Syntax.Lowerer.Build()` in `Keysharp.Components.Scripting.Compiler` walks the AST and emits a Roslyn `CompilationUnitSyntax` (the generated C#).
4. `CompilerHelper.Compile()` in the compiler unit wraps the syntax tree in a `CSharpCompilation` and emits a `MemoryStream`.
5. The compiled assembly is loaded and its entry point is invoked.
6. At runtime, AHK built-ins dispatch to the static methods in `Keysharp.Core/Builtins/`.

Use `--transpile` to see the exact C# that step 3 produces — this is the fastest way to debug lowering issues.

## Platform-specific code

Use `#if WINDOWS`, `#if LINUX`, `#if OSX` preprocessor constants. These are set in each `.csproj`. Corresponding source exclusions (`<Compile Remove="...">`) are in `Keysharp.Core.csproj`. Do not add a Windows-only API without wrapping it in `#if WINDOWS`.

## Documentation: keep it in sync with API changes

Any change to the **script-visible API surface** must be accompanied by a documentation update. That includes adding, removing, or renaming a built-in function, method, property, class, directive, or built-in variable; changing parameters, return values, or defaults; and changing which platforms a feature works on.

1. **`docs/capabilities.json`** — the source of truth for the capability matrix. Add or update the row (`category`, `feature`, `syntax`, per-platform status, `notes`, `tested-by`). Statuses are `full` / `partial` / `planned` / `unsupported` / `unknown`.
2. **`docs/capabilities.md`** — **generated, do not hand-edit.** Regenerate it after every `capabilities.json` change:
   ```powershell
   # from repo root
   pwsh scripts/generate-capabilities.ps1
   ```
   This rewrites `docs/capabilities.md` and re-injects the concise overview table into `docs/reference.md` between the `<!-- CAPABILITIES_OVERVIEW:START/END -->` markers. (`README.md` carries a separate, hand-written condensed table and is not generated.)
3. **`docs/reference.md`** — hand-maintained platform, implementation, and AutoHotkey v2 compatibility notes. Update it when the change affects per-platform support, setup/installation, or a documented difference from AutoHotkey v2.
4. **`../KeysharpDocs`** — the separate user-facing reference site, cloned as a sibling of this repo (it **is** present in the current environment). When it exists, update it in the same change:
   - Pages are hand-written HTML; most function/directive/object/statement pages live in `docs/lib/`.
   - New or renamed pages also need entries in the manually maintained `docs/static/source/data_toc.js` and `data_index.js`. Do **not** hand-edit the generated `data_search.js`.
   - Read that repo's `AGENTS.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and `SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.md` first — it enforces a strict evidence order for behavioral and platform claims (reproducible run on the named platform > Keysharp source/tests > `docs/reference.md` > reviewed `capabilities.json` rows).
   - Validate with `pwsh scripts/Test-Docs.ps1` from the KeysharpDocs root.
   - `pwsh scripts/verify-capabilities-parity.ps1` (run from this repo) cross-checks `docs/capabilities.json` against the KeysharpDocs index and writes `docs/capabilities-parity-report.{json,md}`.

If KeysharpDocs is not present alongside this repo, still do steps 1–3 and note in the change description that the docs site needs the matching update.

## Conventions

- Built-in AHK functions are `public static` methods in `Keysharp.Core/Builtins/` classes.
- The `Ks` module is a one-way surface layer: **the runtime does not read Ks state and does not call Ks utilities.** A new setting a script changes through a `Ks.A_*` accessor is backed by `Script.AccessorData` (or the owning subsystem) with the accessor as a wrapper; internal diagnostics go to `Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine`, not `Ks.OutputDebugLine`. The known exceptions are type identities (`Ks.NamedArgs`, `Ks.StringBuffer`, `Ks.RealThread`, `Ks.Task`, `Ks.Clr`, `Ks.Boolean`), `ToolTips.cs`, and `Menu.cs`; see `docs/design-ks-component.md`.
- AHK `long`/`double`/`string` map to C# `object` at the scripting boundary; use the `.Al()`, `.Ad()`, `.As()` extension methods to convert.
- The `Script.TheScript` singleton is the single source of truth for all runtime state. It is set once at startup (`Script.cs:369`) and is never null during execution.
- Test scripts signal pass/fail by outputting a line containing `PASS` or `FAIL`.
- Suppress warnings 1701, 1702, 8981, 0164, 8974 project-wide (already in `.csproj`). Do not add new `#pragma warning disable` without a comment explaining why.
- Use comments sparingly, and keep the ones that earn their place as short as they can be. A comment should explain why the code is the way it is — including why an obvious alternative was rejected — not restate what it does.
- Do not write comments about previous state ("this *used* to …", "now also handles …", "changed from …"). The reader only sees the current code and has no knowledge of what it replaced.
- Everything a script can see is **PascalCase and spelled out** — properties, method and constructor parameters, and the keys of any object handed back to a script (`Monitor.Width`, `Highlight(X, Y, Width, Height)`, `Monitor.Bounds` → `{X, Y, Width, Height}`, `Image.MeasureText` → `{Width, Height}`). No `W`/`H`/`w`/`h` abbreviations, and no lowercase keys: property lookup is case-insensitive, so `w` and `Width` are *different* names, not two spellings of one, and a script reading `.w` from a `Width` key fails. The exceptions are AutoHotkey's own option-string letters, which are compatibility surface and must not move — `InputBox(…, "W300 H200")`, `Gui.Add(…, "w200 h30")`.
- Write comments in a plain, level voice. No shouting: do not capitalise whole words for emphasis (`NOT`, `ONLY`, `MUST`, `NOTE`), and do not lean on bold, italics or exclamation marks to make a point. If something is genuinely easy to get wrong, say so in an ordinary sentence — the reason carries the weight, not the typography. The same applies to XML doc comments and to comments in `.ks`/`.ahk` scripts.
- Prefer elegant minimal span-based changes (e.g., replacing string Substring+Trim with AsSpan().Trim()) over more verbose manual index-trimming logic when optimizing performance.
