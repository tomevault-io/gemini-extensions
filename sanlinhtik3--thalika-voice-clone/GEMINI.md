# Thalika Agent Instructions

These instructions are for coding agents working on Thalika Voice Clone Studio.

Read `SKILL.md` first for the full project brain. Use this file as the day-to-day working contract.

## Project Identity

Thalika is a local-first Burmese voice-over and voice-clone studio.

Core principles:

- Keep the app local-first.
- Keep generated audio as real PCM WAV.
- Keep user data on local disk.
- Use the managed local VoxCPM2 server as the production inference path.
- Do not add databases, auth, cloud storage, Docker, Runpod, payments, or video features.

## Current Product Surface

Main pages:

- `Script`: paste an original script, rewrite it for narration using Gemini, then send it to Voice Over.
- `Voice Over`: approve script normalization, select/upload voice reference, and generate audio.
- `History`: play, download, delete, and review generated voice-over files.
- `Folders`: inspect local storage, open managed folders, and migrate legacy audio into real PCM WAV.

Current provider:

- `VoxCPM2` (single engine). Burmese pronunciation QA (normalization + lexicon + approval gate) applies automatically when the script is detected as Burmese; multilingual scripts run raw VoxCPM2.

Do not bring back Mock Provider, GPT-SoVITS, or CosyVoice unless the user explicitly asks.

## Architecture Rules

Use:

- Next.js App Router
- React
- TypeScript
- TailwindCSS
- Next.js Route Handlers for the app backend
- Zod for validation
- local Markdown/JSON/files under `data/`

For the local VoxCPM2 server:

- Python 3.10–3.12 with pinned `voxcpm==2.0.3`, served by its own Gradio app
- The Next.js app launches and manages this server as a separate process and talks to it over HTTP — it does NOT embed Python into the Next.js runtime. This is the supported path for local inference.
- Keep generation serialized, seed Python/NumPy/PyTorch consistently, and keep the client/server Gradio argument contract in sync.

Do not use:

- Docker
- Runpod
- Supabase
- PostgreSQL
- MongoDB
- Firebase
- authentication
- payments

All filesystem API routes must include:

```ts
export const runtime = "nodejs";
```

## Local Storage Contract

Store data only in app-managed folders:

- `data/scripts/`
- `data/jobs/`
- `data/outputs/`
- `data/outputs/legacy-backup/`
- `data/memory/`
- `data/profiles/`
- `data/reviews/`
- `data/logs/`

Never expose arbitrary filesystem paths through API responses. Never accept user-supplied paths. Sanitize filenames and prevent path traversal.

Do not store raw reference audio bytes or sensitive transcript contents inside job Markdown. Profile lists must not return raw audio bytes.

## Audio Pipeline Rules

Final output must stay:

- WAV only
- real `RIFF/WAVE`
- `48kHz`
- mono
- `24-bit PCM`

The local server returns WAV. Validate and convert every chunk to `48kHz` mono `24-bit PCM WAV` before downstream processing.

Never concatenate MP3 chunks. Never write mislabeled `.wav` files that contain MPEG audio.

Long script chunk pauses:

- `။`, `.`, `!`, `?`: `260ms`
- `၊`, `,`, `;`, `:`: `160ms`
- no explicit punctuation: `120ms`

Key files:

- `src/lib/script-chunker.ts`
- `src/lib/audio-utils.ts`
- `src/lib/providers/voxcpm2-provider.ts`
- `src/lib/storage/output-wav-migration.ts`

## Burmese Production Quality Rules

Protect these layers:

- reference audio or saved local profile
- browser-side reference quality report
- Burmese normalization
- local Burmese pronunciation lexicon
- normalization approval before generation
- chunked long-script generation
- listening QA after generation

Do not claim 100% human identity match. Phrase quality goals as improving similarity, stability, repeatability, and human review score.

## UI/UX Rules

The app should feel like a calm Apple-style creator tool:

- light theme
- clean rounded cards
- minimal copy
- clear tabs
- lucide icons
- mobile-responsive layout
- no clutter
- no marketing landing page

Prefer shared components. Do not split identical UI into many near-duplicate components.

Important UI files:

- `src/components/AppHeader.tsx`
- `src/components/StudioPageShell.tsx`
- `src/components/ScriptInput.tsx`
- `src/components/VoiceSettings.tsx`
- `src/components/GenerateButton.tsx`
- `src/components/HistoryPanel.tsx`
- `src/components/NormalizationApprovalPanel.tsx`
- `src/app/page.tsx`
- `src/app/script/page.tsx`
- `src/app/history/page.tsx`
- `src/app/storage/page.tsx`

## Common Debug Paths

Generation validation errors:

- `src/lib/validators.ts`
- `src/app/api/generate/route.ts`
- `src/lib/services/generation-service.ts`

Local VoxCPM2 failures:

- `src/lib/providers/hf-utils.ts`
- `src/lib/providers/voxcpm2-health.ts`
- `src/lib/providers/voxcpm2-provider.ts`

Long-script or merge failures:

- `src/lib/script-chunker.ts`
- `src/lib/audio-utils.ts`
- `src/lib/storage/generation-log.ts`

Profile/reference quality issues:

- `src/lib/browser-reference-audio.ts`
- `src/lib/reference-audio-quality.ts`
- `src/lib/storage/voice-profile-store.ts`
- `src/app/api/voice-profiles/route.ts`

Gemini rewrite issues:

- `src/lib/script-rewrite.ts`
- `src/lib/storage/env-store.ts`
- `src/app/api/rewrite/route.ts`

## Verification Checklist

Before finishing backend/provider/audio changes:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run build
```

For audio changes, also verify:

- short script generation works
- long multi-chunk script generation works
- final output starts with `RIFF`
- final output contains `WAVE`
- `file data/outputs/*.wav` reports PCM WAV, not MPEG audio
- `/api/audio/{filename}` returns `audio/wav`
- History playback and download still work

For UI changes, verify:

- Script tab rewrite flow still works
- rewritten script can move into Voice Over
- Voice Over generation still works
- History player layout does not overlap
- Folders storage cards still render
- mobile and desktop views remain readable

## Local VoxCPM2 Server

For production inference:

- Requires Python 3.10–3.12 and ideally a GPU (MPS works on Apple Silicon, CUDA on NVIDIA).
- The app launches and manages a local VoxCPM2 Gradio server as a separate process via `/api/voxcpm-local` (start / stop / status). It never embeds Python in the Next.js runtime.
- Key files:
  - `local-server/server.py` (the actual Python Gradio server; source is tracked)
  - `local-server/requirements.txt` and `local-server/README.md`
  - `scripts/voxcpm-local.sh` (one-command launcher: venv + install + run)
  - `src/app/api/voxcpm-local/route.ts`
  - `src/lib/providers/voxcpm2-health.ts`
  - `src/components/VoiceSettings.tsx`
- The local server must expose the 11-argument Gradio `/generate` contract used by the app. `HF_VOXCPM2_URL` stays on `http://localhost:7860`.
- One stable reference-derived consistency seed must be reused for every chunk. Only pace/loudness outliers may use deterministic alternate takes.
- Preserve conservative chunk active-RMS matching and final PCM WAV validation.

## Git And Data Safety

Do not commit user-generated private data from:

- `data/outputs/`
- `data/profiles/`
- `.env.local`
- logs containing private data

Do not delete generated user data unless the user explicitly asks or an app delete action is being implemented and tested carefully.

The repo may have unrelated local changes. Do not revert them without explicit permission.

## Recommended Future Handoff Docs

If the project grows, add deeper docs instead of bloating this file:

- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `docs/VOICE_PIPELINE.md`
- `docs/UI_GUIDE.md`
- `docs/PROVIDER_CONTRACTS.md`

Keep this file short enough for agents to read at startup.
