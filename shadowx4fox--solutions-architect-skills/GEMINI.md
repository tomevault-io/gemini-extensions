## Trigger Routing — Exact Phrases

When the user types any of these phrases, the correct FIRST action is to invoke the listed skill (not plan, not ask, not explore). These rules override plan-mode's default "Explore → Plan → ExitPlanMode" flow: skill invocation is a read-only context load that is legal inside plan mode, and the skill's own workflow handles clarification, state detection, and change scoping.

| User phrase (any of) | Invoke | Workflow |
|----------------------|--------|----------|
| `release my architecture` · `release architecture` · `release architecture version` · `publish architecture` · `ship architecture` · `tag architecture version` · `freeze architecture` · `bump architecture version` · `finalize architecture` | `sa-skills:architecture-docs` | Workflow 10 — `RELEASE_WORKFLOW.md` (Draft → Released, CHANGELOG, `architecture-v{version}` git tag). PR by default (workflow creates `release/architecture-v{version}` branch, commits, tags, pushes, prints host-agnostic PR instructions). Append `--direct` to commit to the current branch instead. |
| `generate my architecture diagrams` · `create architecture diagrams` · `add diagrams to my architecture` · `update diagrams` | `sa-skills:architecture-docs` | Workflow 8 — diagram generation |
| `migrate my architecture` · `restructure architecture` · `split ARCHITECTURE.md` | `sa-skills:architecture-docs` | Workflow 9 — multi-file `docs/` layout migration |
| `review my architecture` · `peer-review architecture` · `architecture quality review` | `sa-skills:architecture-peer-review` | Full peer review with HTML playground |
| `generate compliance contracts` · `generate compliance documentation` · `compliance contracts` | `sa-skills:architecture-compliance` | 10 compliance contracts (Contratos de Adherencia) |
| `check compliance health` · `compliance portfolio review` · `concept gaps across contracts` | `sa-skills:architecture-compliance-review` | Portfolio gap explorer playground |
| `check requirements coverage` · `traceability report` · `PO spec coverage` · `deviation check` | `sa-skills:architecture-traceability` | `TRACEABILITY_REPORT.md` |
| `generate dev handoff` · `component handoff for <X>` · `implementation handoff` | `sa-skills:architecture-dev-handoff` | Per-component **8-section audience-segmented handoff** (Dev / QA / Ops tracks; TEMPLATE_VERSION 2.0.0) + scaffolded assets. Existing v1 (16-section) handoffs auto-regenerate to v2 silently on the next run. Optional flags: `--parallelism N` (default 4, capped at 8) — Stage 5A handoff-document batch size (sonnet); `--asset-parallelism N` (default 4, capped at 8, **v3.14.7+**) — Stage 5B asset batch size (sonnet for code-style assets, haiku for descriptor-style); `--force` regenerates all components, bypassing the `handoffs/.manifest.json` skip-if-unchanged check. |
| `add component <X>` · `remove component <X>` · `sync component index` · `migrate to C4` | `sa-skills:architecture-component-guardian` | `docs/components/README.md` (only sanctioned writer) and `<!-- EXPLORER_HEADER -->` blocks for every component file it writes (L1 descriptors + L2 containers) |
| `export architecture to Word` · `export handoff to Word` · `export security posture` · `generate .docx` | `sa-skills:architecture-docs-export` | `.docx` export only |
| `run architecture analysis` · `SPOF analysis` · `blast radius analysis` · `STRIDE threat model` · `cost hotspot analysis` · `tech debt analysis` · `security posture` · `security posture validation` · `all analyses` | `sa-skills:architecture-analysis` | Risk & sustainability reports in `analysis/` — output format is asked at runtime (Step 2.4) after analysis selection: **Markdown** (`.md`, grep-friendly, default) OR **HTML** (`.html`, interactive d3.js v7 + d3-sankey, corporate styling, requires internet for viz). The same findings populate either format. |
| `onboard to architecture` · `architecture concept map` · `new team member onboarding` | `sa-skills:architecture-onboarding` | Canvas concept-map playground |
| `PO spec` · `elicit requirements` · `business context intake` · `evaluate PO spec` | `sa-skills:architecture-readiness` | Requirements elicitation + scoring |
| `enterprise alignment` · `enterprise architecture alignment` · `align with enterprise` · `align with enterprise architecture` · `enterprise domain mapping` · `load enterprise context` · `map to enterprise domains` · `check enterprise alignment` | `sa-skills:architecture-enterprise-alignment` | Maps the PO Spec onto the 8-domain BIAN v14 capability map (Enterprise Management, Resource Management, Finance & Risks, Operations, Products, Customers, Channels, Business Enabler — 47 capabilities total) → `ENTERPRISE_ALIGNMENT.md` at project root. **Mandatory gate** before `architecture-docs` Workflow 1 (Step 0.3 — no `SKIP` override; cascades-skip when the PO Spec gate was skipped). Bundled enterprise model is overridable by a project-local `ENTERPRISE_MODEL.md`. The Owner Engagement Plan and Cross-Cutting Findings are lifted into Section 1.5 of `docs/01-system-overview.md` during architecture creation. |
| `create ADR` · `update ADR status` · `supersede ADR` · `list ADRs` | `sa-skills:architecture-definition-record` | ADR CRUD (only sanctioned writer for `adr/`) |
| `create TDR` · `new TDR` · `record technical debt` · `technical debt record` · `update TDR status` · `list TDRs` · `TDR inventory` | `sa-skills:technical-debt-records` | TDR CRUD (only sanctioned writer for `tdr/`). |
| `generate business blueprint` · `datos de iniciativa` · `application blueprint` | `sa-skills:architecture-blueprint` | Organizational blueprint templates |
| `sync to IcePanel` · `IcePanel drift check` · `C4 model sync` | `sa-skills:architecture-icepanel-sync` | C4 import YAML + drift report |
| `regenerate explorer headers` · `add explorer headers` · `backfill explorer headers` | `sa-skills:architecture-explorer-headers` | Backfill `<!-- EXPLORER_HEADER -->` blocks into legacy `docs/NN-*.md` and `docs/components/**/*.md`. Slash-command alias: `/regenerate-explorer-headers` (with optional `--force`, `--dry-run`, or `<path-glob>`). |

**CRITICAL — release vs export are different skills**: "release my architecture" is the Draft → Released lifecycle (`architecture-docs` Workflow 10 — bumps version, writes CHANGELOG, creates `architecture-v{version}` git tag). "export my architecture" is `.docx` generation (`architecture-docs-export`). These MUST NOT be confused. If phrasing is ambiguous, default to `architecture-docs` for release phrasing and `architecture-docs-export` for "word", "docx", "deliverable", "executive summary document" phrasing.

**Deterministic slash-command fallback**: `/release-architecture` invokes `architecture-docs` directly, bypassing phrase matching.

## Plugin Structure

- `.claude-plugin/` — Plugin manifest (`plugin.json`, **authoritative version**) and marketplace registry (`marketplace.json`)
- `package.json` — Root Bun workspace config (workspace: `tools/docgen`)
- `agents/` — Sub-agents consumed by the Agent tool, organized by role:
  - `agents/generators/` — content producers (`compliance-generator.md`, `handoff-generator.md`, `docs-export-generator.md`)
  - `agents/builders/` — input assemblers for generators (`architecture-explorer.md`, `handoff-context-builder.md`)
  - `agents/reviewers/` — quality evaluators (`peer-review-category-agent.md`, `architecture-analysis-agent.md`)
  - `agents/validators/` — 10 domain validators (one per compliance contract)
  - `agents/configs/` — 10 domain JSON configs consumed by `compliance-generator.md` at runtime
  The `handoff-*` agents are pinned to `model: sonnet`; `architecture-explorer` is pinned to `model: haiku` (lightweight corpus enumeration). All keep I/O-heavy work off the user's main-session model (typically Opus).
- `skills/` — 14 skill directories (each containing `SKILL.md` + supporting files)
- `tools/docgen/` — Standalone `generate-doc.js` for Word/.docx generation; own `package.json` under the Bun workspace
- `scripts/build-release.sh` — Packages a release ZIP with SHA256 checksum
- `docs/` — User-facing documentation

## Code Architecture

**Skills**: Each skill is a directory under `skills/` containing a `SKILL.md` frontmatter file plus supporting Markdown guides, templates, and JSON schemas. Skills are pure Markdown — no compiled code — except `architecture-compliance`, which includes TypeScript utilities.

**TypeScript utilities** live in `skills/architecture-compliance/utils/`:
- `validators.ts` — compliance table/section validation
- `post-generation-pipeline.ts` — runs after each contract is generated
- `manifest-generator.ts` — writes `COMPLIANCE_MANIFEST.md`
- `check-dir.ts` — validates output directory
- `resolve-plugin-dir.ts` — resolves plugin cache path at runtime (the skill runs from arbitrary project directories)
- CLI wrappers (`*-cli.ts`) — thin Bun entrypoints

**Agents vs. Skills**: `agents/` holds sub-agents spawned by skills via the Agent tool. They are **not** skills and NEVER to be invoked directly from user-facing prompts.

**Compliance agent architecture**: A single universal `agents/generators/compliance-generator.md` handles all 10 contract types, reading its domain config at runtime from `agents/configs/{contract_type}.json` (template filename, section mappings, grep patterns, requirement codes). Domain-specific validation is handled by 10 separate validator agents in `agents/validators/`.

**Architecture-explorer (v3.16.0)**: A single universal `agents/builders/architecture-explorer.md` (model: haiku) is the front-door navigator for every doc-consuming workflow. It walks the canonical layout (`ARCHITECTURE.md` + `docs/` + `adr/`), extracts `<!-- EXPLORER_HEADER -->` metadata from each doc, and emits an `EXPLORE_MANIFEST` listing every file in the corpus along with its `key_concepts`, `technologies`, `related_adrs`, etc. **No ranking, no cache, no per-task configs.** Downstream skills (compliance, analysis, dev-handoff) consume the manifest and pick what to read using their own domain configs. The dev-handoff orchestrator passes a `component_file` parameter to enable a per-component `focus_component.related_adrs` block sourced directly from that component's EXPLORER_HEADER. Tools: Read + Glob only.

**Versioning**: Canonical version lives in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`. Commits follow `feat: <description> v<semver>`; the `/release` skill bumps, commits, and pushes.

**Word export**: `tools/docgen/generate-doc.js` is invoked as `bun run tools/docgen/generate-doc.js <type> <input.md> <output.docx>`. It has its own `node_modules` under `tools/docgen/`, managed separately from the root workspace.

## Architecture Documentation Rules

Detailed per-skill documentation lives in each `skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` — consult those when invoking a skill. This section captures only the cross-cutting rules Claude must honor while operating in this repo.

### Quick Reference
- All architecture documents must be named `ARCHITECTURE.md`
- Primary template: `ARCHITECTURE_DOCUMENTATION_GUIDE.md` (inside `skills/architecture-docs/`)
- ADR template and guide: `skills/architecture-definition-record/`
- Every `ARCHITECTURE.md` carries a semantic version (see "Architecture Versioning" below)

### Four-Phase Workflow
1. **Business Requirements** (PO) → `architecture-readiness` → PO Spec
   - **1.5 Enterprise Alignment Gate** (Architecture Governance) → `architecture-enterprise-alignment` → `ENTERPRISE_ALIGNMENT.md` (MANDATORY before Phase 2 Workflow 1)
2. **Technical Architecture** (Architecture Team) → `architecture-docs` → ARCHITECTURE.md
3. **Compliance Documentation** (Compliance Team) → `architecture-compliance` → 10 contracts
4. **Development Handoff** (Dev Team) → `architecture-dev-handoff` → per-component handoffs + assets

**PO Spec Gate (Phase 2)**: When no PO Spec exists, the user chooses: (1) full `/skill architecture-readiness` elicitation, (2) async intake from a file, (3) provide context inline (scored against rubric with gap interviews), or (4) skip with `SKIP PO SPEC`. Applies only to new document creation, not editing.

**Enterprise Alignment Gate (Phase 1.5)**: After the PO Spec passes the gate, `architecture-docs` Workflow 1 Step 0.3 requires `ENTERPRISE_ALIGNMENT.md` at the project root. No `SKIP ENTERPRISE ALIGNMENT` override exists — the gate cascades-skips only when the PO Spec gate itself was skipped. The architect runs `/sa-skills:architecture-enterprise-alignment` to produce the file; the alignment Summary, Cross-Cutting Findings, and Owner Engagement Plan are lifted into a new sub-section `1.5 Enterprise Domain Alignment` inside `docs/01-system-overview.md`.

### Architecture Versioning

Every architecture carries a **semantic version** (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) — the canonical reference for all downstream artifacts.

**Whole-architecture version** (in `ARCHITECTURE.md` header):
```markdown
<!-- ARCHITECTURE_VERSION: 1.2.0 -->
<!-- ARCHITECTURE_STATUS: Released -->
<!-- ARCHITECTURE_RELEASED: 2026-04-08 -->

**Version**: 1.2.0
**Status**: Draft | Released | Deprecated
**Released**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Architect**: [Name or Team]
**Supersedes**: v1.1.0
```

**Per-component version** (in each `docs/components/**/*.md`, after the C4 metadata block):
```markdown
**Component Version:** 1.3.0
**Architecture Version:** 1.2.0
**Last Updated:** 2026-04-08
```

**Semver rules**:
- **MAJOR**: Breaking structural changes (new system, architecture type change, major ADR superseded)
- **MINOR**: New components, new sections, new integrations, new ADRs accepted
- **PATCH**: Corrections, clarifications, metric/typo fixes

**Lifecycle**: `v1.0.0` Draft → first release (Status: Released + git tag `architecture-v1.0.0`) → bump per semver on each change. All released versions recorded in `docs/CHANGELOG.md` (Keep a Changelog format).

**Git tag**: `architecture-v{version}` — namespaced to distinguish from plugin/app tags. MUST reflect the doc version under git.

**Archive snapshots** (`archive/v{version}/`): immutable copies of `ARCHITECTURE.md` + `docs/` + `adr/` + `RELEASE_NOTES.md` + `.immutable` marker. Non-git projects: auto-created on every release. Git projects: optional (tag is primary). Files MUST NOT be edited after creation; corrections require a new PATCH release.

**Downstream reference**: Compliance contracts, handoffs, and traceability reports include `Architecture Version: v{version}` in metadata for baseline traceability.

### ADR Scope Partition
- **ADR-001 … ADR-100** — **Institutional** (org-wide Architecture Team decisions)
- **ADR-101+** — **User / Project** (local to a single project)

Institutional range is hard-capped at 100; overflow blocks until an existing institutional ADR is superseded or the new decision is reclassified.

### Component Index Policy
`docs/components/README.md` is writable **only** by `architecture-component-guardian`, which enforces the fixed 5-column schema (`#`, `Component`, `File`, `Type`, `Technology`) with grouped system headers for multi-system architectures. Redirect direct-edit requests there.

### Component Naming Fidelity
When generating any user-visible artifact that references a documented component by name (analysis reports, peer reviews, dev handoffs, compliance contracts, `.docx` exports, traceability reports, prose summaries, diagrams), use the **canonical full name** exactly as it appears in `docs/components/README.md` (Column 2 — `Component`) or the `ARCHITECTURE.md` Component Index if no separate README exists. Do **not** abbreviate, truncate, or alias even when source `docs/**/*.md` files use a shortened form inline — source-doc shortening is for inline readability, not for downstream propagation. Example: write `omn-bs-top-ups-and-bundles` every time — never `omn-bs` or `top-ups-and-bundles` standalone. The 19 agent files under `agents/**/*.md` each carry a `## Component Naming Fidelity` block enforcing this rule at the agent level; the analysis/handoff/peer-review templates carry it as authoring-time guidance. This rule is **complementary** to the Asset Fidelity Rule and "no invention" policy below — those bind structured asset values; this binds component-name occurrences in prose, tables, diagrams, and citations.

### Dev Handoff Scope
`architecture-dev-handoff` is scoped to **C4 Level 2 (Container) components only**. C4 Level 1 (System) descriptors are excluded — they describe system boundaries, not implementable units.

### Diagram Policy (architecture-docs Workflow 8)
4 standard diagrams always generated — Logical View (ASCII), C4 L1 System Context, C4 L2 Container, Detailed View (`graph TB`) — plus Data Flow sequence diagrams per documented flow. All Mermaid targets **v11.4.1**. Canonical locations: standard diagrams in `docs/03-architecture-layers.md`; Data Flow in `docs/04-data-flow-patterns.md` (not configurable). Architecture docs are authoritative — diagrams for undocumented flows are discarded.

### Permissions
Each skill's required `.claude/settings.json` permissions are documented inside its own `SKILL.md`. A pre-configured example consolidating all skill permissions is at `.claude/settings.json.example` — users installing the plugin copy or merge the `permissions.allow` block into their project settings.

**Plugin limitation**: Claude Code plugin agents do not support `permissionMode` in frontmatter (silently ignored). Permissions must be granted via project settings.

### Optional MCP: context7
`architecture-dev-handoff` and `architecture-docs` optionally use context7 when configured:
- `resolve-library-id` — finds the context7 library ID for a framework/tool
- `query-docs` — fetches up-to-date documentation for the resolved library, scoped to a topic

**Constraint**: context7 informs **syntax and structure only** — never content or data values. The Asset Fidelity Rule and "no invention" policy remain absolute; all data values come from architecture docs. If context7 is not configured, both skills degrade gracefully using built-in templates.
