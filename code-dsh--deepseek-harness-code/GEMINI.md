## Current Project Snapshot

- Goal: ship DeepSeek Harness Code with a cross-platform Electron shell, official-format integrated plugins, an immutable DSH Routing Suite, an optional progressive Anchored Standard Agent Preset, native Harness conversation rendering, and an independent watchdog.
- Current phase: release `0.3.3` packages the complete six-plugin Web set plus managed Skills/presets; the verified Universal DMG is available locally and PR #3 is open.
- Primary constraints: macOS Universal local release plus native Windows/Linux CI, runs on the system-installed official Node.js (>=22.13, auto-detected across common install locations on macOS, Windows, and Linux), provisions the global `dsh` command through the official npm install -g flow on first launch, loopback-only Harness, unsigned macOS distribution with ad-hoc signing.
- Active branch/worktree: `release/0.3.3-integrated-plugins` in `.worktrees/release-routing-suite`; the earlier plugin snapshot remains at `archive/desktop-plugin-before-app-merge-20260816`.
- Build/test entry: `pnpm test`; release entry: `pnpm dist:mac` then `pnpm verify:mac release/DeepSeek-Harness-Code-0.3.3-mac-universal.dmg --universal`.
- Current critical risk: the local macOS artifact is ad-hoc signed and not notarized; plugin snapshots update only with reviewed app releases, while user data and unrelated plugins remain outside the application and are never cleared by reinstall.

## User Intent Status

- status: confirmed
- confirmed_at: `2026-08-15T00:00:00+08:00`
- summary: Deliver DeepSeek Harness Code plus a checksum-pinned DSH Routing Suite and optional `anchored-standard` Agent Preset, preserve Standard and official conversation rendering, fix long-stream projection cost, and produce a verified Universal release.
- scope: desktop host, lifecycle recovery, plugin UI, DSH Routing Suite, progressive Agent Preset, managed installation, integrated packaging, performance, branding, verification.
- non_goals: auto-update, Apple notarization, cross-device warm state, reasoning-text capture/replay, private-wire mutation, or benchmark guarantees.
- acceptance: [Project intent](./docs/project/intent.md)

## Mandatory Rules

- Keep this file as the repository's only `AGENTS.md`; never create `agent.md` or nested variants.
- Preserve the official Harness question protocol; do not create a parallel question database or wire format.
- Do not log credentials, authorization headers, cookies, prompt bodies, or response bodies.
- Use test-first changes for runtime behavior and verify before claiming completion.
- Keep detailed facts in `docs/`; this file remains a short router.

## Update Log

Detailed append-only records belong under `docs/knowledge/changelog/` when needed.
