# Carrier — project guide & agent handoff

Carrier is a tiny **Tauri v2** desktop client for **Facebook Messenger** (wraps
`facebook.com/messages` in a chrome-stripped native window). Repo:
**`kristofferR/Carrier`** (use the **kristofferR** GitHub account). **v1.0.0 is
released.** **Cross-platform: macOS, Windows, and Linux** (CI builds all six
targets). The "macOS theme rendering" section below is platform-specific; on
Windows/Linux the window chrome follows `set_theme` directly and there's none of
the WKWebView/title-bar trouble.

## Build / run / install

```bash
# from repo root
bun install
bun run tauri build               # release-ish bundle (debug symbols unless --release config)
bun run tauri build --debug --bundles app   # fast debug .app only

# signed macOS release (Developer ID) — for the real install:
export APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY="Developer ID Application: Kristoffer Risanger (S5Q742QZEL)"
bun run tauri build               # uses src-tauri/tauri.conf.release.json via the CI flow

# install without a Gatekeeper prompt (rm -rf on /Applications is blocked by the safety net):
ditto "<path>/Carrier.app" "/Applications/Carrier.app"
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/Carrier.app"
```

**Gate before every commit** (CI mirrors this):
```bash
cd src-tauri && cargo fmt && cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings && cargo test --lib
bun run check   # Biome lint + tsc typecheck + bun test + rebuild the inject bundles
```

The injected scripts are TypeScript now: **edit `inject/src/`, never
`src-tauri/inject/*.js`** (generated; `messenger.css` and the dev-only
`mcp-bridge.js` are still hand-maintained). After changing `inject/src/`, run
`bun run build:inject` and commit the regenerated bundles alongside the source
— CI fails if they drift. Pure logic lives in `inject/src/messenger/lib/` with
`bun test` coverage; add tests there when extending it.

Releases use curated notes, not a generator. Before pushing a `v*` tag, inspect
the exact tag range and merged PRs and write the release title/body with human or
agent judgment, using direct sections such as **What's New**, **Bug Fixes**, and
**Internal** only when useful. Create the GitHub draft first, for example:

```bash
gh release create v1.4.0 --draft --target main --title v1.4.0 --notes-file release-notes.md
git tag v1.4.0 <release-commit>
git push origin v1.4.0
```

`.github/workflows/release.yml` requires a non-empty curated draft, builds 6
targets, signs + notarizes macOS, attaches artifacts without rewriting the title
or body, and publishes it. Apple/Tauri secrets are set in the repo.

## tauri-mcp — dev webview inspection

Lets an agent inspect/drive the running webview: `execute_js`, `query_page`
(DOM), **`take_screenshot` (background — no window popping to the foreground)**,
click/type, etc. Plugin: [P3GLEG/tauri-plugin-mcp](https://github.com/P3GLEG/tauri-plugin-mcp).
On `main` (committed `d8a25a6`).

- Gated behind the Cargo **`mcp` feature** → **release builds never compile it**.
- Build with it: `bun run tauri build --debug --features mcp --bundles app`. Debug
  builds are marked — the window title reads **"Carrier (debug)"**.
- `.mcp.json` registers the `tauri-mcp` server — **approve the project MCP server
  when a new session prompts for it.**
- **A "Carrier (debug)" build must be RUNNING** for the tools to connect — build it
  with the command above, then `ditto` it into `/Applications`.
- For Hide Names & Avatars selector work, first run the dev-only sanitized probe
  through MCP `execute_js` with code `__carrier_mcp_privacy_probe__`. It reports
  live Messenger selector hits, rectangles, computed `filter`, and sanitized
  ancestor/attribute shapes; it must not expose message text, raw numeric IDs,
  image URLs, or `alt` / `aria-label` contents. Prefer extending this probe over
  guessing selectors or dumping raw DOM when debugging privacy blur coverage.
- Notification work has the same treatment: `__carrier_mcp_notification_row_probe__`
  (conversation-row and message-row shape — where emoji sprites sit, which
  images a row carries) and `__carrier_mcp_sender_avatar_probe__` (what the
  sender-avatar harvest would take, what it cached, and whether each visible
  group preview's sender resolves to a face). Both report classifications and
  counts only.

## Architecture

- **`src-tauri/src/lib.rs`** — the Rust shell: window/tray/menu/settings/theme,
  `on_navigation` (off-site → default browser), `on_download` (media only, blocks
  executables), updater.
- **`src-tauri/inject/`** — injected at document-start: `messenger.css` (hides FB
  chrome + theme/compact/login CSS), `messenger.js` (shortcuts, zoom, image
  viewer, notifications incl. mute / hide-preview privacy, unread badge,
  force-theme, hide names & avatars, login tidy), `panel.js` (toast,
  settings/update bridge). `messenger.js`/`panel.js` are **generated** — the
  typed sources live in **`inject/src/`** (one module per feature; pure,
  unit-tested logic under `inject/src/messenger/lib/`), bundled back to single
  IIFE files by `bun run build:inject` (esbuild, config in `inject/build.ts`).
  Init order in `inject/src/messenger/index.ts` mirrors the old single-file
  section order — capture-phase listeners on the same event fire in
  registration order, so keep it.
- **`dist/settings.html`** — the standalone Settings window.
- **IPC model (important):** the FB page is a **remote origin**, so it **cannot
  call Carrier's own commands**. Page→backend goes through Tauri **plugins**
  (`plugin:opener|open_url`,
  `plugin:window|set_theme`/`set_badge_count`, `plugin:event|emit`) and **core
  events** the Rust side handles via `app.listen_any` (`carrier:open-settings`,
  `carrier:check-updates`, `carrier:unread`, and `carrier:notify` — the
  new-message notification bridge, emitted via `plugin:event|emit` and rendered
  natively). Settings are pushed to the page as `window.__CARRIER_SETTINGS__` +
  a `carrier:settings` event.

## macOS theme rendering — hard-won, do NOT re-litigate

The forced light/dark theme (`Settings → Theme`) was a long rabbit hole on macOS.
These traps are already worked around in code — don't redo them:

- Tauri's `set_background_color` **inverts white→black on macOS** (tauri#12349), so
  the window background is set directly via objc.
- WKWebView is **opaque white** on macOS and bleeds through the title bar / login
  surround — it's forced transparent via a private API.
- The **title bar only themes at window creation**, so a theme switch **recreates
  the windows** (the page reloads; the login session survives via cookies).
- The login page is light-only; its dark mode is applied by JS off the forced theme.

## Current state

v1.0.0 is released; `main` is the trunk. **Live work lives on GitHub, not here** —
`gh issue list` / `gh pr list` for open bugs, enhancements, and WIP branches.
`pre-v1.0` is a kept snapshot base.

---

## Conventions

- GitHub: **kristofferR** (`gh auth switch -u kristofferR`). Trigger CodeRabbit
  **only** through `crq` (never post `@coderabbitai review` directly). A
  `crq autoreview` daemon may be running.
- Batch dependency maintenance into one PR per update cycle. When several
  Dependabot PRs are open, consolidate their current safe updates with the rest
  of the Bun, Cargo, and pinned GitHub Actions audit, validate the combined
  branch, open one PR, then close the superseded bot PRs. Do not queue, review,
  and merge dependency PRs one by one unless the maintainer explicitly asks.
- GitHub comments: a request to **draft** a comment is text-only; never post it.
  A request to **write**, **comment**, **post**, or **send** a comment means
  publish it on GitHub without asking for separate approval.
- Commits: branch off by default — though the maintainer may explicitly ask for a
  direct push to `main` (as with the post-v1.0 merge above). One logical change,
  end with the `Claude-Session:` footer, **no AI attribution**, non-closing issue
  refs (`Ref #5`).
