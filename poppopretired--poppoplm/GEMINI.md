## Tiered Context Protocol

Apply context in tiers. Never attach all docs simultaneously — it degrades output quality.

### Tier 1 — Always Active (automatic via skills)

These rules are auto-applied by Antigravity via the skills in `.agents/skills/`:

| Skill               | Scope                                                     |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `project (Standards)` | Every file — version pins, TypeScript, Check-Before-Write |
| `mastra`            | `src/mastra/**` — agent/tool/workflow patterns            |
| `database`          | `src/db/**` — schema, queries, migrations                 |
| `ui`                | `src/views/**`, `src/components/**`, `*.css` — UI layer   |
| `ingestion`         | `src/lib/ingest-source-content.ts`, `src/routes/sources.tsx`, `src/db/queries/sources.ts` — Source parsing |

### Tier 2 — Per Feature (attach manually at session start)

Attach only the docs relevant to the current feature. Keep total context to: 1 rule file + 1–2 source files + 1 doc URL.

| Building...                   | Attach                                                                                           |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| AI agents / tools / workflows | `@Mastra Docs` + `src/mastra/index.ts` + `src/routes/` + the specific agent file        |
| Database schema or queries    | `@Drizzle Docs` + `src/db/schema.ts`                                                             |
| Zod validation schemas        | `@Zod v4 Docs` + `src/db/schema.ts`                                                              |
| Hono routes or middleware     | `@Hono Docs` + `src/index.tsx` + relevant route file                                             |
| UI views or components        | `@Tailwind Docs` + `@DaisyUI Docs` + `@Alpine Docs` + `@HTMX Docs` + `@Iconify Tailwind4 Docs` + `src/styles.css` |
| Agent-UI integration          | `@Mastra Docs` + `@Hono Docs` + `src/mastra/index.ts` + relevant route file                      |
| Tests                         | `@Bun Docs` + the source file under test                                                         |
| Authentication & Sessions     | `@Auth.js Docs` + `src/lib/auth.ts` + relevant route/view                                        |

### Tier 3 — On-Demand (debugging only)

When a specific API throws an error or behaves unexpectedly:

- Use **web search or read_url_content** to fetch the live, version-accurate API signature for the offending package.
- Attach the package changelog or migration guide only for that package.

**Web search capabilities** are available in this project. Prefer it over static `@Add Docs` for rapidly evolving packages like Mastra — it fetches live documentation mid-session.

## Feature-Scoping Checklist

Answer these five questions before starting any build session. Keep scope to one feature per session.

1. **What is the single user-facing action this feature enables?**
   (One sentence. If you need "and", split into two sessions.)

2. **Which Tier 2 docs are required?**
   (List the specific doc URLs to attach — no more than three.)

3. **Which existing source files should be attached as context?**
   (List specific files, not entire directories.)

4. **What is the Definition of Done?**
   (A specific HTTP response, UI state change, test assertion, or CLI output.)

5. **Is this scoped to one route group OR one agent capability — not both?**
   (If both are needed, split into two sessions: routes first, then agent integration.)

---

## Testing Strategy

- **Test runner:** `bun test` (Jest-compatible, built-in)
- **Balanced cadence:** during feature work, run targeted tests for the behavior you changed; before merge or milestone completion, run full `bun test`
- **Automation now:** use `bun test --watch` as the default local feedback loop while building
- **Automation later:** defer pre-commit/pre-push hooks and CI enforcement until a later stabilization milestone
- **DOM testing:** `happy-dom` — import in test setup for HTML fragment assertions
- **File convention:** `src/foo/bar.test.ts` colocated with `src/foo/bar.ts`

### Where Tests Live

- `src/index.tsx` -> `src/index.test.ts`
- `src/db/queries/notebooks.ts` -> `src/db/queries/notebooks.test.ts`
- `src/lib/foo.ts` -> `src/lib/foo.test.ts`
- For new domains, colocate tests with the source file they verify.

| Test Type      | Approach                                                                       |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Zod schemas    | `schema.parse()` and `schema.safeParse()` with valid + invalid fixtures        |
| DB queries     | Drizzle against in-memory libSQL (`:memory:` URL) with migrations run in setup |
| Hono routes    | `app.request()` helper — no network required                                   |
| Mastra tools   | Mock tool input/output contracts; test schema validation                       |
| HTMX responses | Parse HTML fragments with happy-dom; assert DOM structure                      |
| Responsive UI  | Verify key views at mobile + desktop breakpoints (`sm`, `md`, `lg`)            |

### TDD Guidance (Practical, Not Dogmatic)

- Prefer test-first (red -> green -> refactor) for route behavior, DB query contracts, and bug fixes.
- Allow short implementation-first spikes for UI exploration when behavior is still unknown.
- Before merge, convert spikes into assertions by adding or updating targeted tests for all changed behavior.
- Keep test scope tight: start with the failing behavior, then expand only if adjacent regressions are likely.

### Test Trigger Checklist

- Add a new `*.test.ts` file when you add a new module with meaningful behavior (route group, query helper, schema set, tool/workflow).
- Update an existing test file when you modify behavior in that module.
- Add a regression test for every bug fix.
- During implementation, run targeted tests for touched paths; before merge/milestone completion, run full `bun test`.
- If behavior changed and no assertion changed, that is usually a signal tests are missing.

## Hallucination Risk Summary

These packages have the highest risk of incorrect code generation. Always verify against docs before accepting suggestions:

1. **Mastra v1.x** — LLMs trained on pre-1.0 beta; all prior examples are likely invalid
2. **Zod v4** — Breaking changes from v3 in schema inference, `.default()`, error maps
3. **Tailwind CSS v4** — No JS config; CSS-first; `@plugin` directive is new
4. **DaisyUI v5** — Component class names changed; `@plugin` registration in CSS
5. **Iconify @iconify/tailwind4** — New CSS-only API; use a real two-class example like `iconify lucide--home` (canonical guidance lives in `.agents/skills/ui/SKILL.md`)
6. **Alpine.js v3** — Easy to confuse with Vue/Stimulus syntax; verify directives (`x-data`, `x-show`, `x-model`, `x-on`, `x-bind`) and magic properties before suggesting code
7. **HTMX v2** — Event syntax changed; some attributes removed
8. **Drizzle ORM 0.45** — Rapidly evolving; query builder API diffs from 0.3x
