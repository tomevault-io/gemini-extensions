# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

Native 180°/360° video player for a PlayStation VR2 connected to an Apple Silicon Mac through Sony's PC adapter. macOS sees the headset as a plain 4000×2040 display (side-by-side, left half = left eye); head pose comes over USB via libusb (VID 0x054C, PID 0x0CDE). No kexts, no root, no Sony software. Swift + Metal + AVFoundation on top of a small C core.

The repo is published on GitHub: code, comments, UI strings, logs, README and new commit messages are in English (older history is Russian and stays that way).

## Commands

```sh
brew install libusb
cd player && make          # builds psvr2player and wraps it into PSVR2Player.app (ad-hoc codesigned)
cd player && make clean
player/play [video.mp4]    # launch; streams the app log to the terminal
```

- There is no Xcode project, no SwiftPM package, no tests and no linter. `make` is the only check — it must compile cleanly (C is built with `-Wall`).
- Always run through the `.app` bundle via `play`, not the bare `psvr2player` binary. Without `Info.plist` macOS can't show the removable-volume prompt and reads from external disks hang forever; `play` uses `open` so the app, not the terminal, is the "responsible" process for permissions. Rebuilding changes the ad-hoc signature, so granted permissions (Full Disk Access, Accessibility) may need to be re-added.
- The log always goes to `~/Library/Logs/PSVR2Player.log` when stdout is not a terminal (i.e. via `open`/Finder); `play` tails that file. Swift `print` and the C core's `stderr` share one descriptor. Log lines are tagged by subsystem (`[usb]`, `[display]`, …).
- Without a headset display the player falls back to a preview window on the main screen (and without USB it renders with default calibration and no tracking; proximity-sensor logic is disabled there), so the build can be smoke-tested without hardware: `player/play some_180_SBS.mp4`, then check the log. Hot-plugging the *display* is not supported (the player asks for a restart); the USB link reconnects by itself.
- Recon tools in `tools/` have no Makefile; build them one by one (binaries are gitignored):
  ```sh
  clang -O2 -I"$(brew --prefix)/include/libusb-1.0" -L"$(brew --prefix)/lib" -lusb-1.0 tools/psvr2_probe.c -o tools/psvr2_probe
  ```
  They claim USB interfaces exclusively — the player must be closed while they run.
- `swift -O tools/nebula.swift 8192 player/environment.jpg <variant>` regenerates the space environment panorama.
- `tools/tag-hvc1` (in-place 4-byte retag, reversible with `-r`) and `tools/fix-hev1` (ffmpeg remux) fix HEVC files tagged `hev1`, which AVFoundation refuses to decode (log shows `hev1 … decodable: NO`).

## Architecture

Everything lives in `player/`; all Swift files are compiled together as one module with `cpsvr2.h` as the bridging header. A new Swift or C file must be added to the `psvr2player` rule in `player/Makefile` (both the dependency list and the `swiftc` command line).

### C core (`cpsvr2.c`, `lut.c`)

`cpsvr2.c` owns the libusb session. Protocol is ported from Monado's `psvr2` driver; camera/gaze commands come from PSVR2Toolkit (keep `THIRD-PARTY.md` in sync when porting more).

- SLAM thread: bulk EP 0x83, interface 3, ~60 Hz — on-headset fused quaternion + position.
- Status thread: interrupt EP 0x88, interface 7 alt 1 — proximity sensor, Fn button, IPD and IMU batches at 2000 Hz.
- `psvr2_get_predicted_quat()` is what the renderer actually uses: last SLAM pose integrated forward through the IMU ring buffer (SLAM and IMU share the VTS timestamp scale) plus extrapolation by the requested lookahead. Its output is already in Monado-mapped axes; the raw `psvr2_get_pose()` path needs a different component remap (see `HeadTracker.currentOrientation`). Don't "unify" the two mappings.
- IMU facts (measured): exactly 2000 Hz with no drops, packets of 2 samples at 1 kHz; `vts_us` ticks once per millisecond, so both samples of a packet carry the same value (the core adds 500 µs to the second; `imu_ts_us` is the precise 16-bit clock). Gyro noise at rest ≈ 0.0013 rad/s — ~1/30 px over a 20 ms lookahead, so don't average/filter it. SLAM poses arrive 23 ms old; the IMU integration spans 35–50 ms per frame, and its start is sub-sample accurate (the first sample after the pose counts only from the pose time).
- A SLAM pose older than 0.5 s counts as invalid in all pose getters (dead stream / unplugged USB); `HeadTracker` then holds the last view and the renderer shows a notice.
- USB reconnect: a read thread that dies on a USB error sets `psvr2_link_lost()`; `AppDelegate.checkUSBLink` (1 s timer, headset-display mode only) runs `psvr2_restart()` until the device is back, then re-reads calibration. After a cable replug the device sometimes comes up with the status interface's alt setting missing (`SetAlternateInterface` → `kIOReturnNotFound`, libusb `ERROR_OTHER`); retrying never cures it, a re-enumeration does — `request_device_reset()` does that on its own thread/context because libusb blocks ~10 s inside `libusb_reset_device`.
- Full-speed link: the headset has no high-speed mode, so behind a USB 2 hub/adapter/cable (blue connectors prove nothing — check `Link Speed` in `system_profiler SPUSBHostDataType`) it enumerates at 12 Mbit/s with a reduced descriptor set where interface 7 has no alt 1 — that is what the missing alt setting above really is. `psvr2_start` checks the descriptor first, tries one re-enumeration per connection (cures a bad plug-in), then keeps failing with `psvr2_full_speed_link()` = 1 and `AppDelegate.updateUSB2Notice` shows a "use a USB 3 port" notice in the headset. SLAM poses do still stream there (one 512-byte record per read, ~60 Hz), but SLAM-only prediction was tried and is too jerky to ship.
- Everything that touches the device handle (`psvr2_restart`, camera start/stop) goes through the serial `psvr2ControlQueue`; only the getters are thread-safe.
- Camera thread (passthrough): interface 6, EP 0x87, `VI` packets carrying two 1024×1016 BC4 planes. It uses its own mutex so it never stalls tracking, the enable command must be sent *after* claiming the interface, and the stream is silenced before the device is closed (use-after-free on exit otherwise). Camera start/stop run on `psvr2ControlQueue` — shutdown blocks (thread join + control transfer) and must not run on the main/render thread; `stopAndWait()` precedes `psvr2_stop()`.
- `lut.c` is the 1024×3 distortion/chromatic LUT from Monado, uploaded once as a Metal buffer.

### Render path (`main.swift`)

One fullscreen-triangle pass. The Metal shader is an inline string (`shaderSource`) compiled at startup, so shader errors surface at launch, not at build time. Per output pixel the fragment shader: undistorts per eye and per color channel (factory calibration + LUT) → builds a view ray → applies per-scanline rolling-shutter correction from the gyro → rotates by the head pose → projects into the video (equirect 360 / half-equirect 180 / fisheye / flat screen; SBS / top-bottom / mono) → samples YUV and converts to RGB itself → composites the UI panel and virtual cursor, or the passthrough cameras.

- The `Uniforms` struct exists twice — in MSL inside `shaderSource` and in Swift — and the layouts must match exactly. Parameters are packed into generic `p0…p7` vec4 slots; when adding one, update both structs and both sets of slot comments.
- `VideoSource.frameRefs` (pixel buffer + `CVMetalTexture` wrappers) is captured by the command buffer's completion handler: the wrappers must outlive GPU use or the decoder pool may rewrite a frame that is still being sampled.
- Video frames stay in native YUV 4:2:0 (8/10-bit, BT.709/2020, full/video range) via `AVPlayerItemVideoOutput` + `CVMetalTextureCache`. BGRA conversion is unreliable for 8K (gray frame with live audio), so it is only a fallback (`p4.w`).
- Flat screen (`Projection.flat`, ordinary 2D/3D movies): a world-anchored rectangle, width = `Renderer.screenWidthDeg` (global preference `screenSize`, not per file), eye aspect from `PlaybackConfig.flatAspect` (half-SBS/TB are recognised by shape), fixed ~3 m disparity (`screenDisparity`; farther makes the background parallax of 3D movies diverge), dimmed `environment.jpg` around it. Only this mode samples a mipmapped copy of the frame (`Renderer.mipmappedVideo`, blit + `generateMipmaps` per new frame) with the LOD computed analytically from the lens pixel footprint — derivatives are unusable inside the per-channel loop, and a 1080p–4K frame on ~80° is heavily minified.
- `environment.jpg` (shown when no file is open) goes through the same video path as a 360° mono source; the shader works in gamma space, hence `SRGB: false`.
- Frame pacing: the `MTKView` is paused and drawn manually from a `CVDisplayLink` created for the headset's `CGDirectDisplayID`, dispatching `draw()` to main. MTKView's own timer / `CADisplayLink` may tick from a 60 Hz monitor, which shows every frame twice and looks like ghosting. Don't revert to automatic MTKView drawing.
- Frame timing (measured on an M4 Air, 120 Hz; all visible in the `[stat]` log line): `FramePacer` lets only one draw be queued on main and hands over the display link's output time. Frames really appear `presentDelayPeriods` refresh periods after that time (from `addPresentedHandler` feedback): normally 1 (pose sample → scanout start = 16.3 ms), and it does **not** depend on GPU time. Pose lookahead = time to the measured present + half the scanout + the `[`/`]` bias (`Renderer.poseLookahead`, ≈20 ms); the `T` key switches to the old fixed value for A/B. Left alone, the present queue ends up 2 deep after any display-side stall and stays there (+8.3 ms for the rest of the session), so `draw` drops one frame when it has been deep for a second (at most every 10 s). `maximumDrawableCount = 2` was tried — fps falls to ~100.
- `[stat]` fields: `cpu` main-thread time per frame avg/max (≈3.7 ms of it is `currentDrawable` blocking), `gap` longest frame-to-frame interval, `lat` pose→scanout start, `out` presented time minus display-link output time, `look` lookahead used, `miss` vsyncs that showed no new frame (the real judder count; ~2 per minute come from the system even when idle).
- GPU profile of the fragment shader (6.0 ms): three chromatic passes are the multiplier (1 channel = 2.7 ms), projection trig ≈ 1.8 ms, the distortion LUT only ≈ 0.3 ms, texture sampling ≈ 0 — precomputing the distortion is not worth it.
- `Renderer.setPanelRate` derives scanout duration and the fixed-mode lookahead (~1.2 frames) from the active 90/120 Hz display mode and re-runs on screen-parameter changes.
- `HeadTracker` composes `offsetCurrent * recenter * q`: recenter removes yaw only (keeps the horizon); the manual scene tilt is pitch-only on purpose (manual yaw + pitch produces roll) with a slerp follower. Long Fn press = full recenter including pitch (for lying down).
- Files arrive three ways: command-line argument, the in-headset picker, and `application(_:open:)` (Finder "Open With", Dock drop, `open -a`; `CFBundleDocumentTypes` = `public.movie`, rank Alternate). AppKit may call it before `applicationDidFinishLaunching` — then it only sets `videoURL`.
- `PlayerView.seek(by:)` adds up from the target of the seek still in flight (`pendingSeek`), because `currentTime()` doesn't move until a seek lands.
- `Renderer.draw` also hosts the per-frame state machines: Fn button (single / double / long press), debounced proximity sensor → auto-pause/resume, mouse capture and first-wear recenter.
- `PlaybackConfig.detect(from:)` guesses projection and stereo layout from the file name (whole-token tags incl. DeoVR's `_3DH`/`_3DV`/`MKX200`…; `180`/`360` only when not part of a longer number) and returns a `Detection` whose flags say what the name really named; `Detection.apply` lets track metadata (`ProjectionKind` incl. `Rectilinear` → flat, `ViewPackingKind`, MV-HEVC = mono because only the base layer is decoded) and the frame shape (not 2:1 / 1:1 / 1:2 / 4:1 → flat movie) fill in the rest when `describeTracks` finishes. Both are pure functions.
- `Renderer.config.didSet` is the single place that remembers a manual format: any change while a file is open is saved to `FormatStore` (per path) unless it equals `renderer.detection.config`. So set `detection` *before* `config` when loading, and don't mutate `config` for non-user reasons while a video is open.
- Audio is routed to the headset's USB audio output via CoreAudio; input-only PS VR2 audio devices must be skipped (selecting one makes playback never advance). The device has no volume control, so volume is the player's own 0–100 %.

### Windows and input

- The headset window is borderless, above the menu bar, and intentionally never becomes key. Keyboard focus lives in the remote/status window on the regular monitor so system permission dialogs open where the user can see them; keys reach `PlayerView` through a local `NSEvent` monitor.
- `WindowSweeper` (`sweeper.swift`) uses the Accessibility API to move stray windows off the headset display.
- `UIOverlay` (`overlay.swift`) draws the control panel / file picker / Format submenu with CoreGraphics into a 1024×512 texture; the shader places it as a world-anchored quad and draws the virtual cursor. While the headset is worn the real mouse is captured (warped onto the headset screen and disassociated) and only deltas move the virtual cursor; taking the headset off releases it. The cursor-reachable margin constants (`marginU`/`marginV`) are duplicated in the shader. Button presses return `UIAction`s that `PlayerView.perform(uiAction:)` executes — the same path the keyboard uses.
- `remux.swift`: `Remuxer` — AVFoundation can't open Matroska, so `AppDelegate.loadVideo` sends an `.mkv` through ffmpeg/ffprobe (Homebrew paths searched explicitly: an app launched via `open` has no shell PATH) into `<name>.mp4` next to it (hidden `.<name>.part.mp4` while writing; video copied, HEVC tagged hvc1, audio outside aac/ac3/eac3/mp3/alac → AAC, subs dropped), then plays the MP4; stores (resume, format) are keyed by the MP4. An existing sibling MP4 is played directly and the picker hides the MKV behind it. The file list stays up with a progress OSD; opening another file cancels, quitting cancels and deletes the part file. The user chose "next to the source" over a cache dir on purpose.
- `meta.swift`: `VideoMetaCache` (background thumbnails/duration/resolution for the picker) and `ResumeStore` (per-file resume position). `FormatStore` (per-file manual format). Persistent state is in `UserDefaults`: `volume`, `brightness`, `screenSize`, `lastDir`, `lastFile`, `resumePositions`, `fileFormats` (test-seeding these with `defaults write` needs `<real>` values — plain numbers become strings and are ignored).

### Known physical limit

Residual motion blur is not a bug: in DisplayPort mode the panel runs full-persistence and no low-persistence command is known.
