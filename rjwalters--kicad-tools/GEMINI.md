# Loom Agent Workflows

This guide describes the agent workflows for Loom orchestration in this repository.

**Loom Version**: {{LOOM_VERSION}}

## Agent Archetypes

Loom uses specialized agent roles based on universal archetypes. Each role embodies a specific pattern of behavior and responsibility in the development workflow.

### The Eight Roles

#### 1. Builder (The Magician)
**Mode**: Manual
**File**: `builder.md`
**Purpose**: Transform ideas into working code

The Builder manifests features and fixes through skilled implementation. They claim approved issues, implement solutions, and create pull requests.

**Workflow**:
```
loom:issue → claim → implement → test → PR (loom:review-requested)
```

**Key Activities**:
- Claim `loom:issue` labeled issues
- Create worktree for isolated development
- Implement features or fix bugs
- Write tests and documentation
- Create PR with `loom:review-requested` label

#### 2. Judge (The Justice)
**Mode**: Autonomous (5 min intervals)
**File**: `judge.md`
**Purpose**: Ensure quality and fairness through review

The Judge evaluates pull requests with objectivity and thoroughness. They provide constructive feedback and make approval decisions.

**Workflow**:
```
loom:review-requested → review → approve/request-changes → loom:pr or back to author
```

**Key Activities**:
- Find PRs with `loom:review-requested` label
- Review code for quality, correctness, and style
- Test the changes locally
- Approve or request changes
- Update labels appropriately

#### 3. Curator (The Hermit)
**Mode**: Autonomous (5 min intervals)
**File**: `curator.md`
**Purpose**: Maintain and enhance the issue backlog

The Curator brings wisdom and clarity to issues. They enhance vague issues with technical details and context.

**Workflow**:
```
unlabeled issue → enhance → loom:curated → (approval) → loom:issue
```

**Key Activities**:
- Find issues without workflow labels
- Add technical details and acceptance criteria
- Link related issues and documentation
- Mark as `loom:curated` for human approval
- After approval, mark as `loom:issue`

#### 4. Architect (The Emperor)
**Mode**: Autonomous (15 min intervals)
**File**: `architect.md`
**Purpose**: Design system structure and make technical decisions

The Architect brings order through careful planning. They create architectural proposals for significant changes.

**Workflow**:
```
analyze → create proposal → loom:architect → (approval) → loom:issue
```

**Key Activities**:
- Analyze system architecture
- Identify improvement opportunities
- Create detailed architectural proposals
- Document decisions and tradeoffs
- Label proposals with `loom:architect`

#### 5. Hermit (The Fool)
**Mode**: Autonomous (15 min intervals)
**File**: `hermit.md`
**Purpose**: Simplify through removal and letting go

The Hermit identifies what can be removed or simplified. They propose removing unused code and reducing complexity.

**Workflow**:
```
analyze → identify bloat → create removal proposal → loom:hermit → (approval) → loom:issue
```

**Key Activities**:
- Analyze codebase complexity
- Find unused or redundant code
- Identify over-engineered solutions
- Create simplification proposals
- Label proposals with `loom:hermit`

#### 6. Doctor (The Star)
**Mode**: Manual
**File**: `doctor.md`
**Purpose**: Fix bugs and maintain health

The Doctor brings hope through fixing what's broken. They address bugs, PR feedback, and maintenance tasks.

**Workflow**:
```
bug report OR PR feedback → fix → test → commit → push
```

**Key Activities**:
- Claim bug reports or blocked issues
- Address PR review feedback
- Fix failing tests or builds
- Maintain existing PRs
- Resolve `loom:blocked` issues

#### 7. Guide (The Hierophant)
**Mode**: Autonomous (15 min intervals)
**File**: `guide.md`
**Purpose**: Organize and prioritize work

The Guide brings structure through organization. They triage issues, set priorities, and maintain workflow clarity.

**Workflow**:
```
review backlog → update priorities → organize labels → document status
```

**Key Activities**:
- Review entire issue backlog
- Update priority labels
- Organize issues by category
- Document project status
- Remove stale labels

#### 8. Driver (The Chariot)
**Mode**: Manual
**File**: `driver.md`
**Purpose**: Direct action and execution

The Driver executes commands directly without specific role constraints. A plain shell for custom tasks.

**Workflow**:
```
receive command → execute → report
```

**Key Activities**:
- Execute user commands directly
- Perform ad-hoc tasks
- Debug and investigate
- Run custom scripts

## Label-Based Coordination

Agents coordinate autonomously through GitHub labels. No direct communication is required.

### Label Definitions

**Workflow States**:
- `loom:issue` - Approved for work, ready for Builder to claim
- `loom:building` - Issue being implemented OR PR under review/revision
- `loom:review-requested` - PR ready for Judge to review
- `loom:pr` - PR approved, ready for human to merge

**Proposals** (require human approval):
- `loom:architect` - Architectural proposal by Architect
- `loom:hermit` - Simplification proposal by Hermit
- `loom:curated` - Enhanced issue by Curator

**Status Indicators**:
- `loom:blocked` - Work blocked, needs help or clarification
- `loom:urgent` - Critical issue requiring immediate attention

## Autonomous Operation

Agents can run autonomously at configured intervals using either:
1. **Tauri App Mode**: Visual terminal management with interval timers
2. **Manual Orchestration Mode**: Multiple Claude Code terminals with periodic commands

### Autonomous Agents

**Judge** (5 min intervals):
```
Every 5 minutes: Find and review PRs with loom:review-requested label
```

**Curator** (5 min intervals):
```
Every 5 minutes: Find unlabeled issues, enhance them, mark as loom:curated
```

**Architect** (15 min intervals):
```
Every 15 minutes: Analyze codebase, create architectural proposals
```

**Hermit** (15 min intervals):
```
Every 15 minutes: Identify complexity, create simplification proposals
```

**Guide** (15 min intervals):
```
Every 15 minutes: Review issue backlog, update priorities and organization
```

### Manual Agents

**Builder**, **Doctor**, **Driver** require human direction:
- Builder: Claim specific issues when ready to implement
- Doctor: Respond to bug reports or PR feedback
- Driver: Execute user commands as requested

## Coordination Examples

### Example 1: Feature Development

1. **Curator** finds vague issue #42, enhances it with technical details
   - Adds `loom:curated` label
   - Human/Champion reviews and adds `loom:issue` (curated label is preserved)

2. **Builder** (you) claims the issue
   ```bash
   gh issue edit 42 --remove-label "loom:issue" --add-label "loom:building"
   ./.loom/scripts/worktree.sh 42
   cd .loom/worktrees/issue-42
   # ... implement feature ...
   git push -u origin feature/issue-42
   gh pr create --label "loom:review-requested"
   ```

3. **Judge** automatically finds PR #123
   - Reviews code
   - Approves and changes label: `loom:review-requested` → `loom:pr`

4. **Human** merges PR #123

### Example 2: Architectural Change

1. **Architect** analyzes codebase
   - Creates issue #44: "Proposal: Migrate to microservices architecture"
   - Adds `loom:architect` label
   - Includes detailed analysis, tradeoffs, implementation plan

2. **Human** reviews proposal
   - Discusses with team
   - Decides to proceed
   - Removes `loom:architect`, adds `loom:issue`

3. **Builder** claims and implements (same as Example 1)

### Example 3: Code Simplification

1. **Hermit** identifies complex module
   - Creates issue #45: "Simplify authentication middleware"
   - Adds `loom:hermit` label
   - Documents complexity metrics, removal plan

2. **Human** approves simplification
   - Removes `loom:hermit`, adds `loom:issue`

3. **Builder** claims and simplifies (same as Example 1)

## Best Practices

### For Autonomous Agents

1. **Always check labels first** - Don't work on issues/PRs already in progress
2. **Update labels immediately** - Signal state changes to other agents
3. **Be thorough** - Autonomous work should be high quality
4. **Fail safely** - If unsure, add `loom:blocked` and stop
5. **Document reasoning** - Explain decisions in issue/PR comments

### For Manual Agents

1. **Claim before starting** - Update labels to prevent conflicts
2. **Use worktrees** - Isolate work in `.loom/worktrees/issue-{number}`
3. **Test thoroughly** - Run full test suite before creating PR
4. **Write clear commits** - Explain what and why
5. **Link issues** - Use "Closes #N" in PR descriptions

### For Humans

1. **Review proposals promptly** - Don't block autonomous agents
2. **Merge approved PRs** - Keep the pipeline flowing
3. **Provide clear feedback** - Help agents learn and improve
4. **Adjust intervals** - Fine-tune autonomous agent timing
5. **Monitor and intervene** - Step in when agents get stuck

## Configuration

### Setting Up Autonomous Agents (Tauri App)

1. Open Loom application
2. Select this repository as workspace
3. Create terminals and assign roles:
   - Terminal 1: Judge (autonomous, 5 min)
   - Terminal 2: Curator (autonomous, 5 min)
   - Terminal 3: Architect (autonomous, 15 min)
   - Terminal 4: Builder (manual)
4. Start engine

### Setting Up Manual Orchestration Mode

```bash
# Terminal 1: Judge
/judge

# Terminal 2: Curator
/curator

# Terminal 3: Architect
/architect

# Terminal 4: Builder (you)
/builder
```

## Troubleshooting

### Labels Not Updating

```bash
# Check repository labels
gh label list

# Re-sync labels
gh label sync --file .github/labels.yml
```

### Conflicting Work

If two agents claim the same issue:
```bash
# Check who claimed first
gh issue view 42 --json timeline

# Yield if you claimed second
gh issue edit 42 --remove-label "loom:building"
```

### Stale Labels

Guide role should clean these up automatically, but you can do it manually:
```bash
# Find stale in-progress issues (no activity for 7 days)
gh issue list --label "loom:building" --json number,updatedAt

# Remove stale label
gh issue edit 42 --remove-label "loom:building"
```
