# CLAUDE.md — Agent Instructions

This file tells Claude Code (and other AI agents) how to work with this repository.

---

## What This Repo Is

A Claude Code guide, packaged as a plugin. There are seven skills:

- **`/guide:onboard`** — Interactive getting-started walkthrough for new users
- **`/guide:ask`** — Q&A skill backed by comprehensive reference documentation in `skills/ask/references/`
- **`/guide:introspect`** — Introspective Development — audit lifecycle coverage, find gaps, and improve your development environment
- **`/guide:game-mode`** — Gamified usage tracker that rewards feature breadth and depth with a level system
- **`/guide:level-up`** — Feature roadmap and personalized next-step coaching
- **`/guide:migrate-to-claude`** — Smart migration from other AI coding assistants (Cursor, Windsurf, Copilot, Codex, etc.) to Claude Code
- **`/guide:visualize-setup`** — Generate an interactive HTML dashboard of all installed Claude Code skills and MCP servers

This repo serves two audiences: humans browsing the docs on GitHub, and Claude Code users who install it as a plugin to get guided help.

This is primarily a **content** repo — no application code, no build system. Bash hook scripts are tested with bats-core (see `tests/`).

## Plugin vs. Project Tooling

This repo serves two purposes — distinguish them before starting any work:

### Plugin features (ships to users)

Everything under `skills/`, `hooks/`, `.claude-plugin/`, and reference docs. These are what users get when they install the plugin:

- Skills (SKILL.md files)
- Hooks (hooks.json + tracking scripts)
- Reference documentation (`skills/ask/references/`)
- Game mode, level-up, migration, visualize-setup
- Plugin manifests (plugin.json, marketplace.json)

### Project tooling (maintains the repo)

Infrastructure that helps develop and maintain the plugin but does NOT ship to users:

- Agents (`agents/`) — doc-verifier, pr-review, version-bump
- CI workflows (`.github/workflows/`) — docs-freshness, pages, tests
- Test suite (`tests/`) — bats tests for hook scripts
- CLAUDE.md, README.md — repo documentation

### Before starting work

**Always ask: "Is this a plugin feature or project tooling?"** This determines:

| | Plugin feature | Project tooling |
|---|---|---|
| **Where** | `skills/`, `hooks/`, `.claude-plugin/` | `agents/`, `.github/`, `tests/` |
| **Version bump?** | Always | Usually not |
| **How to test** | User-facing verification | `bats tests/*.bats` or CI |

If it's unclear, ask before proceeding.

## Critical Rules for Content

These rules MUST be followed when editing or creating skills:

1. **Slash commands are a subset of Skills** — never list them as a separate category. They are the same mechanism.

2. **Three automation mechanisms only**: Hooks, Skills, Sub Agents. Agent Teams are NOT a fourth mechanism — they are architecturally distinct (separate full Claude instances) and always flagged as experimental.

3. **Worktrees are an isolation layer**, not a coordination mechanism. They provide git-level isolation for parallel work.

4. **Agent Teams are experimental** — always flag them with ⚠️ and note they may change.

5. **The onboarding skill is interactive**, not a reference dump. It walks users through setup step by step. The ask skill answers questions by reading reference docs.

6. **IKEA analogy**: Hooks = assembly events (they fire during the process), Skills = packages with instruction sheets (reusable, pre-written), Sub Agents = packages + a handyperson (delegate and they deliver).

7. **Difficulty tiers** — Every reference doc has a `> **Level: 🌱/🌿/🌳**` badge after the title. Sections that differ from the file's overall level get an emoji prefix on the `##` heading. Only tag sections that differ — don't repeat the file-level tag on every heading.

---

## Versioning

The authoritative plugin version lives in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` (`"version": "X.Y.Z"`). The `marketplace.json` plugin entry also has a `version` field — **`plugin.json` takes priority**, but keep both in sync to avoid confusion.

### Why bumping matters

Installed plugins are cached at `~/.claude/plugins/cache`. **Version is the cache key** — if you change code but don't bump the version, users won't see the update. Always bump the version when shipping changes.

### Semantic versioning

| Change type | Bump | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| **Major** (X) | Breaking changes, structural redesigns | Removing a skill, renaming hook events, changing game-data schema incompatibly |
| **Minor** (Y) | New features, new reference docs, new hook behaviors | Adding a skill, adding a tracking category, new reference doc |
| **Patch** (Z) | Bug fixes, wording tweaks, small improvements | Fixing a regex in a hook script, typo in a reference doc, adjusting a case branch |

### Rules

- Always bump the version in the same commit as the change itself — never leave a functional change without a version bump
- Bump both `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`
- Use the `version-bump` agent (`agents/version-bump.md`) to keep both files in sync automatically — it infers bump type from the git diff

---

## Git Workflow

Before staging or committing changes, check the current branch. If you are on `main`, create a new descriptive branch first — never commit directly to `main`.

### After implementing a plan

When a plan's implementation is complete, run the PR review cycle:

1. **Branch** — if on `main`, create a descriptive branch (`feature/short-name`)
2. **Commit & push** — stage only files changed by the task (never `git add -A`), commit, push with `-u`
3. **Create PR** — `gh pr create` with a summary of the changes
4. **Wait for reviewers** — wait ~5 minutes, then check for automated review comments and CI status
5. **Triage in plan mode** — enter plan mode and categorize each comment: fix, fix + pushback, pushback, or acknowledge
6. **Fix & push** — apply approved fixes, commit, push
7. **Follow-up issues** — open GitHub issues for items outside the PR's scope
8. **Reply & resolve** — reply to every comment thread and resolve it

Use the `pr-review` agent (`agents/pr-review.md`) and its helper scripts to automate steps 4-8.

### After completing work

When a task is done and merged, clean up:

- Compact or clear conversation history if context is getting long
- Delete merged feature branches locally: `git branch -d feature/branch-name`
- Close related GitHub issues (use `closes #N` in commit messages for auto-close)
- Run `/guide:introspect` to review what could be improved for next time

## How to Edit

- The onboarding skill lives at `skills/onboard/SKILL.md`
- The ask/Q&A skill lives at `skills/ask/SKILL.md`
- Reference docs live at `skills/ask/references/beginner/`, `intermediate/`, and `expert/` — organized by difficulty tier
- User stories live at `skills/ask/references/` (root level) — narrative scenario walkthroughs
- The visualize-setup skill lives at `skills/visualize-setup/SKILL.md`
- The plugin manifest is at `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` (plugin name: `guide`)
- README.md is the human-facing entry point
- This file (CLAUDE.md) provides agent context — update the structure tree when adding/removing references
