# Repository Scope

This file defines repository-wide rules for rawsql-ts developers.
Deeper `AGENTS.md` files take precedence when they add stricter or narrower rules without weakening completion criteria.

## Global Guardrails

- Keep generated artifacts, fixtures, and derived docs aligned with their source assets.
- Keep scaffold code, scaffold-facing docs, and published-package smoke checks aligned when they describe the same workflow.
- Do not weaken completion criteria or skip required verification.
- Prefer `pnpm` and scoped commands when working in a package.
- Keep repository artifacts in English unless a deeper rule says otherwise.
- Keep assistant-user conversation in Japanese in this repository.
- Do not mix customer-facing guidance into this repository policy.

## Guidance Routing

- Use the repo-local guidance under `.codex/agents/` and `.agents/skills/` for planning, verification, review, and reporting details.
- Root `AGENTS.md` defines repository-wide policy only; detailed output formats and workflows belong to subagent or skill guidance.
- Before substantial multi-step work, read the relevant guidance under `.codex/agents/` or `.agents/skills/` instead of relying on root policy alone.
- For package-level Scope, Test Policy, Authority Model, Technology Policy, review-plan, or generated review view changes, use `.agents/skills/package-spec-review/SKILL.md`.
- For structured metadata migrations or rule registry changes, use `.agents/skills/structured-metadata-migration-review/SKILL.md` to check schema versioning, canonical enum parity, real fixture parsing, and evidence/display-label integrity.
- For broad generated or derived diffs that may exceed review-tool limits, use `.agents/skills/broad-generated-diff-review-packet/SKILL.md` to prepare scoped review packets before PR handoff.
- Do not turn `AGENTS.md` into the storage location for starter walkthroughs, AI onboarding prompts, dogfooding playbooks, or investigation scripts; keep those in dedicated docs or skills.

## Documentation Guardrails

- Treat README and other human-facing repository docs as reader-facing entry documentation, not AI-facing operational notes.
- Keep human-facing docs scannable: prefer short headings, short paragraphs, short sentences, and strong structure.
- Prefer separation over deletion: if content is too detailed for README, move it to linked docs instead of silently dropping important information.
- Keep repository facts, commands, contracts, and file layout accurate and easy to verify.
- Keep structured metadata sources, schema files, implementation allowlists, fixtures, and generated review views aligned when they describe the same review harness.
- Broad generated docs or API diffs should preserve source-to-generated traceability so reviewers can inspect the source decision separately from deterministic output.

### README Mode Rules

- Each substantial README section must have one primary mode:
  - tutorial
  - how-to
  - reference
  - explanation
- Do not mix modes within the same section unless the boundary is explicit.

### Mode Expectations

- tutorial
  - learning-oriented
  - optimize for first success
  - use small steps
  - minimize explanation
  - avoid alternatives unless essential for success
  - link out for deeper background

- how-to
  - goal-oriented
  - solve one concrete task or problem
  - include only the steps and decisions needed for that goal
  - avoid broad conceptual teaching

- reference
  - information-oriented
  - describe facts, commands, options, file layout, contracts, and limits
  - stay concise, structured, and neutral
  - do not add persuasion, narrative, or long explanation

- explanation
  - understanding-oriented
  - describe why, tradeoffs, design intent, constraints, and alternatives
  - do not turn explanation into a procedural guide

### README Defaults for This Repository

- README should lead with what the project is, why it exists, and how to start.
- Quickstart sections should stay short and copyable.
- Important concepts must remain available either in README or in clearly linked follow-up docs.
- Do not remove conceptual sections, follow-up reading, or navigation aids merely to shorten the README.
- When revising README, confirm that a new reader can understand the project and reach a successful first step from the first screen.

## Plan and Reporting Minimums

- When an issue, PR comment, or request includes a proposed solution, planning must still make the underlying objective explicit and check whether the proposed solution is only one tactic rather than the actual goal.
- If there is meaningful uncertainty about the true objective, decision driver, or success condition, resolve that recognition gap during planning before implementation begins.
- Plans must state the source issue or request, acceptance items, verification methods, and explicit out-of-scope items when scope is limited.
- Multi-step tasks must keep a working ledger in `tmp/PLAN.md` unless a deeper `AGENTS.md` says otherwise.
- `tmp/PLAN.md` should be updated when the plan changes, when a blocker is discovered, and when a verification or dogfooding result materially changes the current understanding.
- `tmp/PLAN.md` is local task state, must not be committed, and exists separately from durable workflow rules in `AGENTS.md`.
- Important recognition mismatches, false completion claims, or verification misses must also be captured in `tmp/RETRO.md` when they could plausibly recur within the same task or in a future task.
- `tmp/RETRO.md` is a local-only reflection ledger for what went wrong, why it happened, whether the fix can be mechanized, whether a durable rule should be promoted, and whether a PR should be blocked until the item is resolved.
- Keep durable workflow policy in `AGENTS.md`; keep task-specific reflection, examples, and unresolved retro items in `tmp/RETRO.md`.
- If a retro item suggests a reusable mechanical guardrail, consider promoting it into repository guidance, tests, scripts, or a Codex skill instead of leaving it only as narrative reflection.
- Record a retro item when the miss caused rework, weakened a completion claim, hid a verification gap, or would be hard to reconstruct reliably from the final diff alone.
- Do not require retro entries for every small typo or harmless local correction; use it for mistakes that matter to task judgment, workflow safety, or future repeatability.
- Reports must distinguish `done`, `partial`, and `not done`.
- Reports must distinguish `tests were updated` from `tests passed`.
- If any test or check fails, reports must name the failing test or check explicitly instead of summarizing it only as a generic verification failure.
- If any test or check fails, reports must state whether the failure is newly introduced by the current change or reproducible on the base branch without the change.
- If any test or check fails, reports must state the failure's decision weight explicitly: required merge gate, non-required PR check, local-only check, or another clearly named category.
- If work proceeds despite a failing test or check, reports must explain why proceeding is acceptable for this change, based on the failure's category and whether it is pre-existing.
- A failed required verification command is in scope for the current branch until proven otherwise. Do not classify it as unrelated merely because the stack trace points at a file outside the current diff.
- Before calling a failed required check out-of-scope, provide one of these forms of repository evidence: the same command fails on the base branch in the same environment; repository guidance marks the check as non-blocking for this change; or the failure depends on an unavailable external prerequisite that is not required for the acceptance item.
- If none of that evidence exists, fix the failure or keep PR readiness blocked. Reporting must not downgrade the failure to `partial` or `non-blocking` by assertion alone.
- Before creating or editing a pull request, preserve the repository PR template requirements and run `scripts/check-pr-readiness.js` locally against the exact PR body using a temporary event payload. Do not create, edit, or report a PR as ready while that script fails.
- For CLI-facing or scaffold-related changes, prefer generating the PR readiness sections with `pnpm pr:readiness:prepare` or copy the exact checkbox labels and same-line fields from `.github/pull_request_template.md`; free-form PR prose is not sufficient evidence for the readiness gate.
- If a task changes GitHub branch protection or rulesets, reports must explicitly state which merge blockers were changed or verified, not just the intended required status checks.
- Ruleset or branch protection reports must explicitly call out approval requirements, Code Owner review requirements, signed-commit requirements, and required status checks whenever those settings could affect mergeability.
- Do not imply that bot review comments or `COMMENTED` review states satisfy an approval requirement; approval claims must name the actor and the approval-capable review state.
- GitHub-facing reports must not use local filesystem paths.
- Supplementary evidence alone must not justify a strong `done` claim.
- Final user-facing progress and completion reports should use explicit sections rather than long narrative-only blocks when multiple concerns are being reported.
- When reporting task status, show the current status label near the top and again at the end when the report is long enough that scrolling could hide it.
- When reporting multiple concerns, separate at least `status`, `current situation`, and `remaining issues or decisions` so the reader can scan quickly.

## Implementation Decision Rules

- Treat fallback behavior as a last resort, not as a default convenience.
- Before adding a fallback, first consider whether the problem should instead be fixed directly, rejected as unsupported, or made fail-fast with a clear error.
- Prefer an explicit error over a silent degradation when silent recovery would hide a configuration problem, weaken guarantees, or make quality harder to judge.
- If a fallback is still the best option, make the trigger condition and guarantee limits explicit in code, tests, and reporting.
- For local-source dogfooding or scaffold developer-mode flows, fail fast when dependencies or CLI entrypoints are missing and make the next recovery step explicit.
- Do not overwrite scaffold-owned or user-authored files without an explicit force path; failed initialization must not leave partial overwrites behind.
- Scope decisions should be intentional: do not broaden a task automatically, but do not reject closely aligned follow-up work automatically either; decide based on fit, risk, and verification cost.

## Collaboration and Escalation

- Ask clarification questions during planning when objective, scope, or decision criteria remain materially ambiguous.
- During implementation, prefer autonomous resolution of local design and coding details whenever the repository evidence is sufficient.
- Interrupt implementation with a user question only when the remaining ambiguity is consequential enough that proceeding would risk the wrong outcome, unsafe edits, or misleading verification.

## Review Minimums

- Development has two completion stages: first prove the feature and regression tests, then run a separate finishing review pass before PR handoff.
- The finishing review pass must use the available self-review workflow or repo-local review skill, and it must look for cross-mode regressions such as direct command versus PR/worktree command behavior.
- The finishing review pass must include a concept boundary review when the change touches package behavior, generated scaffold output, generated runtime code, docs, or PR wording. Read the owning package concept, package scope, technology policy, or Concept Spec when one exists.
- For `@rawsql-ts/ztd-cli`, the concept boundary review must check that the standard generated runtime path remains runtime-free: no dependency on `ztd-cli`, `rawsql-ts`, runtime mapper libraries, runtime validator libraries, SQL JSON result shaping, or hidden business SQL rewriting. Test support and driver adapters may exist only within their stated non-ORM, driver/test roles.
- Final PR text and final implementation reports must pass self-review before human review.
- Before creating or editing a PR, read `.github/pull_request_template.md` and use `.agents/skills/pr-readiness/SKILL.md` when present.
- Before claiming a PR is ready, run the repository PR readiness script locally when `scripts/check-pr-readiness.js` exists, or explicitly state why it could not be run.
- Blockers must be resolved or explicitly called out before human review.
- Before creating or presenting a PR, review `tmp/RETRO.md` and either resolve every PR-blocking retro item or explicitly surface the remaining item and why it is safe to defer.
- A retro item with `PR gate status: open` blocks PR readiness.
- `accepted defer` may be used only when the remaining risk, owner, and follow-up path are explicit in the final report or PR text.

## QuerySpec Completion

- A QuerySpec used for product behavior is incomplete unless it has a ZTD-backed test that executes the SQL through the rewriter.
- A property-only validation test is not sufficient for product behavior.
- If the ZTD-backed test cannot be written yet, do not write the product-behavior QuerySpec yet.
- Example-only QuerySpec files may omit the ZTD-backed test only when explicitly labeled as examples and the limitation is stated in the same change.

## Test Default

- Unless the request explicitly says not to, behavior changes must add or update tests in the same change.
- When ambiguous, prefer the strongest executable test for the changed behavior.
- For QuerySpec work, default to a ZTD-backed test that executes the SQL through the rewriter and validates observed behavior.

## SQL Shadowing Troubleshooting

- When a SQL-backed test fails, first determine whether the query is shadowing the intended SQL path or touching a physical table directly.
- If shadowing is wrong, check in this order:
  1. DDL and fixture sync
  2. Fixture selection or specification
  3. Repository bug or rewriter bug
- Do not use DDL execution as a repair path for ZTD validation failures.
- Prefer repository evidence over manual database repair.
