# Project agent memory

Wheelhouse - a portable, forkable IssueOps machine. Issues in this repo are a
human-in-the-loop decision queue for cross-repo OSS maintenance, driven entirely
by GitHub Actions. This file holds durable, project-intrinsic notes.

The name: a ship's wheelhouse is where the captain steers. This repo is where
you steer your open-source maintenance - what needs your hand surfaces as a card
and you make the call. (The product is "Wheelhouse"; the generic verb "triage"
still appears where it's plain English, e.g. "triage the queue".)

## Non-negotiable invariants

- **Portability / fork-and-own.** Never hardcode an owner or repo name in
  workflows or scripts. Owner is always `github.repository_owner` (env
  `GITHUB_REPOSITORY_OWNER`); the fleet + policy come from the single root file
  `wheelhouse.config.yml`. A fork on any account must work after editing only that
  file and adding the secrets.
- **Security.** Owner-gate every acting path (`sender == repository_owner`, plus
  optional `maintainer` override via `wheelhouse_core.py authorized`). Cross-repo
  actions use `FLEET_TOKEN`; everything that touches THIS repo's cards uses the
  default `GITHUB_TOKEN` (this is also what prevents the decision-handler from
  re-triggering itself - GitHub does not raise workflow events for
  GITHUB_TOKEN-authored activity). The fork-CI / pwn-request HOLD (exit 4 in
  `approve_ci`) must never be removed: approving fork CI that changes
  `.github/workflows`, `.github/actions`, or `action.yml(.yaml)` is held for
  manual review and fails closed. **Scan-time auto-approve is a STRICT SUBSET of
  the manual gate**: it shares the one `ci_safety` verdict and approves only what
  is provably safe (no risky files AND no `pull_request_target` posture, all reads
  fail closed), so it can never auto-clear anything the manual path would HOLD.

## Architecture

- **State lives in GitHub, not on disk.** Open issue = pending decision; closed =
  consumed. Labels are state (`needs-decision`, `pending-triage`, `processing`,
  `resolved`, `blocked`, `repo:*`, `kind:*`, `priority:*`). A hidden
  `<!-- wheelhouse-state: {...} -->` block in each card body carries
  `{repo, number, kind, head_sha, options}` plus the material fields
  `{comp, tests, priority}` (the latter three added so a refresh can cheaply and
  deterministically decide "did this target materially change?" - see "Card
  refresh" in Sharp edges). `options` is also material for refresh comparison,
  but is normalized as a sorted set so checkbox reordering alone does not
  refresh the card. The state block also carries `updated_at` unconditionally
  (populated for issue-triage items, empty for pr-review) - it is NON-material,
  existing purely as the issue-triage auto-triage cache key, mirroring how
  `head_sha` doubles as the pr-review cache key. Automatic triage (pr-review
  AND issue-triage) adds non-material cache fields such as
  `triaged_sha` and `triage_status`; those are deliberately outside
  `MATERIAL_FIELDS` so a triage result never changes classification or forces a
  card refresh. A held card also carries non-material `held: true` until its
  first auto-triage attempt publishes the normal decision controls. The state
  block also carries `render_version`, another
  non-material field alongside `triaged_sha`: it is a one-time re-render
  trigger stamped by `render()` (see "Card refresh" in Sharp edges) that exists
  purely so a display-only fix (e.g. the author `@mention` drop) propagates to
  already-open cards; it is never a `MATERIAL_FIELDS` member and never
  influences classification. `render_card.py` writes that marker, but
  `parse_state_block` also accepts the legacy `<!-- triage-state: ... -->`
  marker (cards rendered before the rename) - back-compat that must stay so a live
  queue keeps working. It also tolerates old `wheelhouse-state` cards that lack
  the material fields: a missing field reads as "unknown", so such a card is seen
  as changed exactly once and refreshes itself (backfilling the fields), then
  no-ops. The local lock/board/ledger from the original `triage.py`
  are intentionally dropped (replaced by Actions
  `concurrency` + issues/labels/comments).
- **Workflows:** `ingest` (dispatch/manual -> upsert a card), `decision-handler`
  (tick/slash/**plain-English** -> act on target -> consume card), `scan-backstop`
  (hourly scan -> reconcile: create/refresh/close - the primary keep-current path
  now that cards refresh on material change, render-version staleness, or a
  held-card publish trigger; safe to run hourly because reconcile is a full
  no-op when none of those triggers fires, and queues automatic PR or issue
  triage when the
  current revision (a PR's `head_sha`, or an issue's `updatedAt`) lacks a fresh
  `triaged_sha` cache; its "List open cards" step lists THIS repo's open cards via
  `gh api --paginate --slurp "repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues?..." | jq '...'` -
  `gh api --slurp` and `--jq` are mutually exclusive in the installed `gh` CLI, so
  the `--paginate --slurp` result (an array of per-page arrays) is piped into a
  standalone `jq` instead of passing `--jq` to `gh api` itself;
  `tests/test_workflow_lint.py` guards against this combination reappearing in
  any workflow), `triage` (automatic,
  lightweight, advisory PR-card OR issue-card context; pr-review is gated on
  `auto_triage`, issue-triage on the INDEPENDENT `auto_triage_issues`, both also
  requiring `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`; cached once per revision), `deep-review` (ALWAYS-ON, code-grounded;
  gated only on `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` - no config flag),
  `no-mistakes-required` (PR-to-`main` gate: the job `name:` MUST stay exactly
  `PR must be raised via no-mistakes` - it is the check name the fleet convention
  and this repo's own `wheelhouse.config.yml compliance_check` reference - and it
  passes only when the PR body carries the no-mistakes signature
  `Updates from [git push no-mistakes](https://github.com/kunchenguid/no-mistakes)`,
  with bot authors skipped; Wheelhouse dogfoods on itself the same gate it enforces
  on the fleet, so contributions go through `git push no-mistakes` - see
  `CONTRIBUTING.md`).
- **Scripts:** `wheelhouse_core.py` (scan/classify/dedup/security gate + the
  shared CI-safety verdict `ci_safety` / `repo_pr_target_posture` and scan-time
  auto-approve in `build_repo`, plus shared utils
  `parse_state_block`, `authorized`, `state`, `nl-decisions-enabled`,
  `auto-triage-enabled`, `auto-triage-issues-enabled`, `qualify_issue_refs`
  (rewrites a bare GitHub-autolink `#N` in model text to `owner/repo#N` - see
  "Cross-repo reference qualification" in Sharp edges)),
  `render_card.py` (render + card CRUD; `CHECKBOX_OPTIONS`/`OPTION_LABELS` carry
  the per-kind checkboxes, including the non-consuming `investigate` box on
  pr-review/issue-triage; held `pending-triage` placeholder rendering;
  automatic triage section rendering, `triaged_sha` cache updates, and trusted
  triage-result card edits that publish held cards), `apply_decision.py` (deterministic `parse` then
  `execute`; the NON-CONSUMING `investigate` routing + `clear-checkbox`; plus the
  natural-language `nl-eligible`/`nl-prompt`/`nl-route` that map an owner's
  free-text comment to a structured result), `nl_readonly_search.py` (installs
  the optional `wheelhouse-search` wrapper for READONLY_TOKEN-backed LLM
  context),
  `build_item.py` (normalize ingest payload), `reconcile.py` (backstop
  create/**refresh**/close and automatic triage dispatch). `apply_decision` imports `wheelhouse_core` and
  `nl_readonly_search`; `reconcile`/`render_card` import `wheelhouse_core` (and
  `build_item` imports `render_card`) via
  `sys.path.insert(0, dirname(__file__))`.
- **Reusable actions (pinned to full SHAs).** `decision-handler` delegates two
  mechanical jobs to the `issue-ops` toolkit instead of hand-rolling them:
  `issue-ops/parser` renders the card's checkboxes as `{selected, unselected}`
  (run twice - new body + pre-edit body - so `apply_decision.py` can keep the
  "exactly one newly-ticked" diff), and `issue-ops/labeler` does every
  `processing`/`resolved`/`blocked`/`needs-decision` add/remove (with
  `create: true` so it also creates the label objects). Pin both to a commit SHA
  with a trailing `# vX.Y.Z` comment; never a floating tag.

## Sharp edges

- Decision cards are machine-created.
  The target author is shown as plain text (`by <login>`), never as a GitHub
  `@mention`.
  Cards are the owner's private queue and must not notify contributors.
  The card body's hidden state block and the
  per-checkbox `<!-- opt:KEY -->` markers are load-bearing - the handler diffs
  the `selected` lists `issue-ops/parser` returns for the new vs pre-edit body to
  find the newly-ticked option (the marker survives because the parser strips
  only the `- [x] ` prefix), and parses slash-commands against the kind's allowed
  set. Don't reformat them away.
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/wheelhouse-decision.yml` is load-bearing, not cosmetic:
  `issue-ops/parser` only returns `{selected, unselected}` when a template marks
  the section as a `checkboxes` field, and it matches the section by EXACT heading
  text. Its `checkboxes` label MUST stay `"Your decision"` to match the
  `### Your decision` heading `render_card.py` emits. (Cards are still rendered by
  `render_card.py`, not this template; a hand-filed issue from it has no state
  block, so the handler treats it as a no-op.)
- **Card refresh (an open card must reflect CURRENT target state).** Both the
  event path (`render_card.upsert_card`) and the backstop (`reconcile.py`) keep a
  card current: when a target's MATERIAL state changes - `head_sha`, compliance
  (`comp`), tests (`tests`), `kind`, `priority`, or checkbox `options` - the
  card is re-rendered in place; title/summary/recommendation re-render naturally
  and are NOT change triggers. Option comparisons use set equality; display
  order remains the order provided in the card body/state. A refresh ALSO fires
  when the card's stored `render_version` is behind the current
  `CARD_RENDER_VERSION` - a non-material, one-time, self-terminating trigger
  (`render_stale`) for propagating a display-only fix (e.g. the author
  `@mention` drop) to already-open cards that have no material trigger of their
  own. A card missing `render_version` (written before this field existed)
  reads as behind, so every pre-existing pure card refreshes exactly once and
  then carries the current version (`render()` stamps it), so it no-ops on the
  next scan - no churn loop. Bump `CARD_RENDER_VERSION` whenever a future
  display-only change should propagate the same way. A render-version-only
  refresh is a same-revision cosmetic refresh (same `head_sha` for a pr-review
  card, same `updated_at` for an issue-triage card): it reuses the same
  `_preserve_same_revision_triage` path as a same-revision refresh (an
  existing `### Triage` section and its `triaged_sha`/`triage_status` cache
  survive untouched, no re-triage for that revision), and it does NOT drop the
  "target updated" comment (that stays gated strictly on `head_sha` actually
  changing - an issue's `updated_at` alone never triggers that comment, since
  it is not a material field). `CARD_RENDER_VERSION` is currently `2`: the
  1 -> 2 bump retroactively re-qualifies cross-repo refs cached in an
  already-open card's `### Triage` section from before `qualify_issue_refs`
  existed. `_preserve_same_revision_triage` now runs the lifted section
  through `wheelhouse_core.qualify_issue_refs(section, owner, repo)` before
  re-inserting it - `owner` is `GITHUB_REPOSITORY_OWNER` (read in
  `_refresh_card`, the same env source the fresh-triage render path uses) and
  `repo` is the card's own deterministic `old_state["repo"]` (falling back to
  the item's repo), NEVER the model's own text. This is the same one-time,
  self-terminating propagation shape as the earlier author `@mention` drop:
  every pre-existing card refreshes once, gets its cached triage refs
  qualified and its `render_version` stamped to `2`, and the next scan is a
  full no-op.
  The `TRIAGE_START`/`### Triage`/`TRIAGE_END` markers contain no
  `#N` so qualifying the whole section string leaves them intact.
  The shared pure helpers live in `render_card.py`
  (`material_changed`, `render_stale`, `held_publish_needed`, `refresh_needed`,
  `is_refreshable`, `plan_label_update`); `reconcile.py`
  pre-checks them (using the card row it already listed) so the common
  no-change case never hits the API, and `upsert_card` re-checks them before it
  edits (defense in depth for the event path). Three rules are load-bearing and
  must not be loosened:
  - **Only refresh a pure `needs-decision` card.** A re-render resets the card's
    checkboxes, so a card already `processing`/`resolved`/`blocked` is left
    completely untouched - refreshing one would clobber an in-flight decision or
    race the decision-handler. (`is_refreshable` is the guard; the lock set is
    `NON_REFRESHABLE_LABELS`.) This is the chosen safe rule, and it gates the
    `render_version` trigger exactly the same way - a mid-decision card is
    never refreshed just because it is render-stale.
    A held `pending-triage` card deliberately stays refreshable because it keeps
    `needs-decision` and carries no non-refreshable lock label.
  - **No-op when neither trigger fires.** A card that is both materially
    unchanged AND render-fresh, and does not need held-state publishing, gets no
    body edit, no label churn, and no comment - never rewrite a card just to
    put back an identical body. The
    material check is a cheap dict compare of the state block's material
    fields, which is why those fields are carried in the state JSON; the
    render-staleness check is the same kind of cheap compare against
    `render_version`, and `held_publish_needed` is the same kind of cheap
    predicate for a held card whose auto-triage path is no longer available.
  - **Replace the managed labels, don't just add.** `upsert_card` removes
    `repo:*`/`kind:*`/`priority:*`/`target:*` labels that no longer apply
    (`plan_label_update`), so a changed priority/kind doesn't leave both the old
    and new label stuck on the card. It also syncs the exact `pending-triage`
    label to the current `held` state. `needs-decision` and any human-added
    label are never removed.
  When `head_sha` changed the refresh also drops a short "target updated" card
  comment so the owner sees a re-review is warranted rather than being silently
  swapped underneath. All of this stays on the ambient `GH_TOKEN` (= default
  `GITHUB_TOKEN`) like every other card write, so a refresh never re-triggers the
  handler and never runs under `FLEET_TOKEN`. reconcile only ever refreshes from
  scanned `items`, which exist solely for `ok:true` repos, so an `ok:false` repo
  (state unknown) is never refreshed - the same invariant that bars closing its
  cards.
- **Automatic triage is a cached card-side side job, not routing - and now
  covers issue-triage as well as pr-review, on two INDEPENDENT toggles.**
  It applies only to pure `needs-decision` cards (including held
  `pending-triage` cards, which deliberately retain `needs-decision`), gated
  per kind: pr-review by the effective `auto_triage` setting, issue-triage by
  the effective `auto_triage_issues` setting - each with its own global default
  (both TRUE), per-repo override, and item-level opt-out, so flipping one never changes the
  other's behavior. Both also require `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` to be present.
  For explicit ingest payloads, `auto_triage:false` / `auto_triage_issues:false`
  are item-level opt-outs only; neither can force triage on when the global or
  per-repo config disables it.
  The cache key is the card state's `triaged_sha`, compared to the item's
  current **revision** - a pr-review item's `head_sha`, or an issue-triage
  item's `updated_at` (issues have no head SHA, so their GraphQL `updatedAt`
  is the freshness key instead; it advances on any edit or new comment).
  `render_card.triage_revision(item)` / `render_card.state_revision(state,
  kind)` are the single pair of helpers that pick the right field for a kind;
  every triage cache function (`triage_fresh`, `should_auto_triage`,
  `body_with_triage_queued`, `body_with_triage_result`,
  `_preserve_same_revision_triage`) goes through them so pr-review and
  issue-triage share one code path instead of forking it.
  Missing `triaged_sha` on an existing open card counts as stale, so legacy
  cards of either kind backfill exactly once on the next eligible scan.
  Before dispatching `triage.yml`, `reconcile.py` / the ingest fast path edits
  the card state to set `triaged_sha=<current revision>` and
  `triage_status=queued`; this intentionally spends at most one Claude attempt
  per revision even if the asynchronous workflow errors, times out, or cannot
  parse a result.
  **A just-created card must be read back BY NUMBER, never via
  `find_card`'s label-filtered `gh issue list`.** That listing is not
  read-after-write consistent immediately after `gh issue create`, so reading
  it back milliseconds later can silently miss the card and skip queuing its
  first auto-triage attempt (only a later scan's pre-existing-card backfill
  path would then catch it). `_create_card`/`upsert_card` therefore always
  return an int issue number (never a URL), and `reconcile.py`'s new-card
  branch reads the fresh card via `current_card({"number": n})` -> `get_card`,
  which IS consistent. The ingest fast path mirrors this: the `upsert` CLI
  writes the created/refreshed number to `$GITHUB_OUTPUT` (`issue=N`), and
  `ingest.yml`'s "Queue auto triage" step passes it as `queue-triage --issue
  N`, so that path also reads by number; `queue-triage` keeps the `find_card`
  lookup only as a fallback when no number is supplied (back-compat for a
  manual invocation).
  `triaged_sha`, `updated_at`, and the visible `### Triage` section are
  non-material: they must never affect `classify`, `material_changed`,
  decision parsing, merge execution, fork-CI approval, author filtering, or
  conflict routing.
  For a pr-review card, `head_sha` IS material, so a head move both refreshes
  the card and makes the fresh head eligible for one new triage attempt in the
  same pass. For an issue-triage card, `updated_at` is NOT material (an issue's
  title/comp/tests/kind/priority/options rarely change on a new comment), so a
  new comment/edit can make the card eligible for one new triage attempt
  WITHOUT any card refresh at all - `reconcile.py` checks triage eligibility
  independently of the material-change branch for exactly this reason.
  If config is off or the token is absent, no dispatch happens and cards render
  exactly as the deterministic card did before this feature.
  `triage.yml` itself checks out the PR head for a pr-review card (and
  verifies it did not move), or the repo's DEFAULT branch read-only for an
  issue-triage card (there is no head to verify); both paths share the same
  gate/Claude/card-update steps, security posture, and `--revision` CLI
  argument (`render_card.py triage-apply|triage-fail --revision <head_sha or
  updated_at>`).
- **Held cards - a card is not owner-visible in its normal form until its
  first auto-triage attempt completes.** When `should_hold` says a brand-new
  pr-review/issue-triage card would have triage queued for it (same gate as
  auto triage itself: the per-kind flag AND `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`), the
  card is created HELD instead of in its normal form: `needs-decision` STAYS
  (triage.yml's resolve step requires a pure, refreshable `needs-decision`
  card or it never runs), the `pending-triage` label (`HOLD_LABEL`) is added
  on top, and the body's "Your decision" section is a placeholder with no
  checkboxes - no `<!-- opt:* -->` markers, so it is naturally inert to the
  decision handler's checkbox/slash-command parsing; `apply_decision.py
  cmd_parse`/`cmd_nl_eligible` also short-circuit on the state block's
  `held` flag as defense in depth. `held` is a non-material state key (like
  `triaged_sha`) - never in `MATERIAL_FIELDS`, never affecting
  classify/material_changed/decision-parsing/merge-close-approve/
  fork-CI-safety/author-filtering/conflict-routing.
  A held card is **published** - real checkboxes appear, `pending-triage` is
  removed - the moment its own auto-triage ATTEMPT completes, in the SAME
  `update_card_triage` call `triage-apply`/`triage-fail` already use: this is
  gated on the attempt COMPLETING, never on it SUCCEEDING, so a held card can
  never stay hidden because triage errored, timed out, or (a fail-open
  hardening beyond the original ask) even failed to DISPATCH -
  `reconcile.py`'s `maybe_queue_auto_triage` and the `queue-triage` CLI both
  now publish a held card immediately with a "could not be started" note if
  `dispatch_triage_workflow` itself throws, since the queued-cache write
  already landed and a later scan would never retry that revision otherwise.
  Publishing is keyed to the card's own CURRENT revision
  (`state_revision`/`triage_revision`): a stale attempt whose revision no
  longer matches (the card was refreshed to a newer revision while the
  attempt was in flight) is a no-op, because that refresh already queued a
  fresh attempt for the new revision which will publish the card itself -
  exactly mirroring how a stale triage result is already dropped for a
  published card.
  A refresh rechecks a currently held card with the same `should_hold(item, has_token)` gate used at creation.
  If the refreshed item still qualifies for auto triage, `upsert_card` preserves the placeholder and queues the fresh attempt as before.
  If the refreshed item no longer qualifies (for example the kind changed away from pr-review/issue-triage, config disabled auto triage, or the token is absent), `upsert_card` publishes it silently in that same refresh pass: normal checkboxes, no `pending-triage` label, no `held` state key, and no synthetic triage section or note.
  This keeps a held card's self-heal-close (its target left the worklist, or merged/closed) working through the SAME existing reconcile logic with no held-specific branching, since a held card is `is_refreshable` exactly like any other pure pending card.
  Config off or no token: a brand-new eligible card is created in its normal form immediately, exactly as before this feature - never held.
  **Fail-open safety net for a `triage.yml` run that never reaches its
  update step at all** (e.g. `resolve` itself throws on a transient `gh
  issue view` error before writing its outputs, which would otherwise leave
  the update step running with an EMPTY issue/revision and silently doing
  nothing - `triaged_sha` is already cached for that revision, so no future
  scan would ever retry it and the card would stay held forever): a final
  `always()` step runs `render_card.py triage-recover --issue --kind
  --revision`, sourced from the RAW `workflow_dispatch` inputs (never
  `steps.resolve.outputs`, which may be empty). It grounds against the
  card's actual CURRENT state and is a no-op unless the card is genuinely
  still held with `triage_status: queued` for exactly that revision -
  publishing it with a generic "did not finish" note only in that exact
  stuck case, so it can never double-write over a result the normal update
  step already recorded, whether that result was a success or a `triage-fail`.
  If the trusted source snapshot is unavailable, the workflow cannot safely run
  `render_card.py`; in that narrow case it clears the queued triage cache for
  the exact raw-input revision instead, so a future scan can retry rather than
  leaving the held card permanently hidden.
- Natural-language decisions are owner-comment-only and structured: the LLM
  returns `{mode: action|answer|clarify, action?, free_text?, answer?}` to
  `decision.json` and nothing else. `apply_decision.py nl-route` is the trust
  boundary - it validates `action` against the per-kind allowlist and only then
  sets the `decision` output that makes the SAME deterministic `execute` run
  (so every guard - allowlist, head-SHA re-check, fork-CI HOLD, token isolation,
  concurrency - applies unchanged). `answer`/`clarify` only post a card comment
  and leave the card open.
  When `READONLY_TOKEN` is absent, the LLM stays in the
  legacy `--allowedTools Write` mode and receives no shell `GH_TOKEN`. When the
  optional `READONLY_TOKEN` secret is present, the LLM step uses that read-only
  public-scoped token as both the action `github_token` input and shell
  `GH_TOKEN`, plus a narrow Bash allow-list for `wheelhouse-search`, which wraps
  scoped read-only `gh` lookups across the target repo and configured fleet
  repos. This is deliberate because
  `claude-code-action` exposes its `github_token` input to Claude's subprocess as
  GitHub CLI credentials.
  Search output is UNTRUSTED DATA for answering questions only, never an
  instruction and never an authorization to act.
  The LLM never receives `FLEET_TOKEN` - it maps intent or answers, it never acts.
  After Claude runs, the workflow copies only a regular, size-capped
  `decision.json` into runner temp, then runs `nl-route` and `execute` from a
  read-only trusted source copy with a scrubbed environment.
- Token discipline per step: scan/execute and the read-only target reads for the
  LLM (`triage` prepare + target-code checkout, `deep-review` prepare + its target-code checkout, decision-handler
  `nl-fetch`) use `FLEET_TOKEN`; all
  card writes - including every `issue-ops/labeler` step (its `github_token`
  defaults to `github.token`, passed explicitly here) - use `github.token`. The
  card's own comment thread is also this repo's data, so the NL `nl-comments`
  fetch uses `github.token`, NOT `FLEET_TOKEN`. Mixing them either breaks
  cross-repo acting or creates a re-trigger loop. The LLM step itself never gets
  `FLEET_TOKEN`; without `READONLY_TOKEN` it receives no shell credential or
  shell tools, and with `READONLY_TOKEN` it only gets that read credential as the
  action `github_token` input and shell `GH_TOKEN` for context search through
  `wheelhouse-search`. Target content and any search output reach it only as
  delimited untrusted data inside the prompt, OR (for triage/deep-review) as code
  already on disk from a
  `persist-credentials: false` checkout, so NO acting token is left on disk for
  the LLM to read.
  `READONLY_TOKEN` is never used by `execute` and never gates or authorizes an
  action.
- **Investigate is a NON-CONSUMING checkbox (the one tick that doesn't close the
  card).** It is offered on pr-review/issue-triage cards (NOT ci-approval, a fast
  security gate). Ticking it must NEVER consume the card: `apply_decision.py
  parse` routes `investigate` to a separate `investigate` output and leaves
  `decision` empty, so the consuming execute/close steps stay dormant. The
  handler's Investigate step then (1) re-renders the card with the box cleared
  (`apply_decision.py clear-checkbox`, on `github.token` so the edit never
  re-triggers the handler) so the owner can investigate again after new commits,
  and (2) triggers the ONE investigation workflow (`deep-review.yml`). It triggers
  it via `workflow_dispatch` - NOT by applying the `needs-deep-review` label -
  because a `github.token`-applied label would not raise the `labeled` webhook
  (the very recursion barrier that stops the handler re-triggering itself), and
  using `FLEET_TOKEN` to label THIS repo's card would break token discipline and
  portability (a public Wheelhouse's `FLEET_TOKEN` need not even have write access
  here). `workflow_dispatch` via `github.token` IS the documented exception to
  recursion-prevention, so it reliably fires; that is why decision-handler needs
  `actions: write`. The dispatch carries the parsed `repo`/`number`/`kind`/
  `head_sha` from the tick event, and `deep-review.yml` uses those immutable
  inputs for bot-dispatched runs instead of re-reading the mutable card body.
  Owner-triggered `workflow_dispatch` can also be run with only `issue=...` for direct verification; that path fetches and parses the current card body with `github.token`.
  The Claude action has `allowed_bots: github-actions[bot]` for the decision-handler dispatch only, because otherwise `anthropics/claude-code-action` rejects the `github.token`-dispatched bot run before it emits `execution_file`.
  Keep that allow-list exact - never `*` and never an external bot actor.
  The manual `needs-deep-review` label path is unchanged (a human applying it raises the `labeled` event normally) and remains a card-body parse path in `deep-review.yml`, alongside owner-triggered issue-only `workflow_dispatch` verification runs.
  This is a deliberate asymmetry: the manual label and issue-only workflow-dispatch paths authorize only the repository owner.
  A configured co-maintainer uses the Investigate checkbox, which runs through the maintainer-gated decision-handler (`wheelhouse_core.maintainers()` = owner + configured maintainer).
  `investigate` is in the
  per-kind `ALLOWED` set but is filtered out of the NL verb list/validation
  (`nl_allowed`): an investigation is a deliberate click, not free-text intent, so
  the NL path neither offers nor accepts it.
- NL conversation memory is owner-scoped, and the scoping IS the security
  boundary. `decision-handler.yml` fetches the card's thread (`nl-comments`,
  `github.token`) and `apply_decision.py assemble_history` renders it as a
  "Conversation so far" block of trusted context - but ONLY comments authored by
  a maintainer or by the workflow bot (`github-actions[bot]`, the assistant's own
  prior turns) survive. The maintainer set is exactly `wheelhouse_core.maintainers()`
  (repo owner + optional configured `maintainer`) - the SAME notion the
  `gate`/`authorized` path uses; do not invent a second rule. Every other author
  (a contributor, a third-party bot) is dropped ENTIRELY so non-owner text can
  never enter the LLM's instruction context. The triggering comment is excluded
  from history by id (`github.event.comment.id`) because it is still passed
  separately as the single new instruction; the history is context only. None of
  this widens the acting trust model: optional `READONLY_TOKEN` search output is
  also untrusted reference data, the LLM still never gets `FLEET_TOKEN`, and
  `nl-route`'s allowlist re-validation is unchanged.
- `wheelhouse_core.py scan` is resilient: a repo that fails to read is reported as a
  warning (`ok:false`) and skipped, and `reconcile.py` must never close cards for
  an `ok:false` repo (state unknown).
  Open PRs, open issues, and PR closing issue references are paginated.
  If any of those pagination paths cannot complete, the repo result is marked
  `truncated` and `reconcile.py` must not self-heal close existing cards for that
  repo because state is incomplete.
  If the PR list or closing-reference scan is incomplete, `build_repo` withholds
  issue-triage cards for that repo because it cannot prove which issues are
  already addressed by open PRs.
- **Queue author filter.**
  Decision cards are for other people's work, so `build_repo` suppresses cards for PRs and issues authored by the canonical maintainer set (`wheelhouse_core.maintainers()` = repo owner plus optional configured `maintainer`) or by bots.
  Bot detection uses the GraphQL `author.__typename == "Bot"` signal plus the `*[bot]` login suffix fallback.
  Missing or unreadable author metadata fails open, so an unknown author can still raise a card rather than silently dropping a human contributor's work.
  The author filter suppresses card emission only; for fork PRs in `needs-ci-approval`, the normal safety-gated auto-approve/noop path still runs first so safe owner, maintainer, and bot CI runs do not hang awaiting approval.
  This deliberately bypasses the global or per-repo `auto_approve_ci: false` opt-out only for those author-excluded ci-approval PRs; contributor PRs still honor the opt-out and card as before.
  Unsafe, uncertain, or failed owner, maintainer, and bot CI-approval targets still do not emit cards, but they keep the scan-log warning.
  Skipped targets still remain in `open_pr_numbers` / `open_issue_numbers` but are absent from the `items` worklist, so `reconcile.py` consumes any existing pure `needs-decision` owner, maintainer, or bot card on the next successful scan.
- **Merge conflicts leave the maintainer queue.**
  `wheelhouse_core.py` fetches GraphQL `pullRequests.nodes.mergeable` and treats only `CONFLICTING` as authoritative.
  `UNKNOWN` or missing mergeability fails open because GitHub computes it asynchronously, so the PR classifies normally until a later scan can prove the conflict.
  A conflicting PR that would otherwise route to `merge-ready` or `review-needed` becomes waiting-on-contributor `needs-rebase`, which is intentionally absent from `NEEDS_MAINTAINER`.
  This never rewrites `needs-ci-approval`: fork CI approval is independent of whether the eventual merge would conflict, and issue triage is unrelated.
  On the `ok:true` scan path, `build_repo` posts a contributor nudge under `FLEET_TOKEN` for non-owner/non-maintainer/non-bot `needs-rebase` PRs.
  The nudge body carries hidden marker `<!-- wheelhouse-rebase-nudge:<head_sha> -->`; before posting, Wheelhouse paginates the PR comments and skips if that marker already exists, so it posts at most once per conflicted head SHA and can nudge again only after a new push creates a new head.
  If comment lookup or posting fails, the scan logs a warning and still emits no card; it never posts without first checking for the current marker.
  The PR stays in `open_pr_numbers` but drops out of `items`, so `reconcile.py` consumes any existing pure `needs-decision` card on the next successful scan.
- **Scan-time fork-CI auto-approve (kill the routine "approve CI" click).** One
  shared `ci_safety(slug, pr, repo_posture)` verdict is the single security
  definition; `approve_ci` uses it too, so the auto path is a STRICT SUBSET of the
  manual gate. The verdict combines (a) **risky files** (`_risky_ci_files`: the
  PR touches `.github/workflows`/`.github/actions`/`action.yml(.yaml)` - the
  pwn-request HOLD, unchanged, fails closed) and (b) the per-repo
  **`pull_request_target` posture** (`repo_pr_target_posture`: read the DEFAULT
  branch's `.github/workflows/*.yml|*.yaml` ONCE per repo - never per PR - and
  see whether any workflow triggers on `pull_request_target`; fails closed if the
  workflows can't be read/parsed). Any PR whose base ref is not the repo default
  branch fails closed (posture-present, never auto-approved). A
  `pull_request_target` workflow that ALSO
  checks out the PR head (`_checks_out_pr_head`) is flagged LOUDLY as the exploit
  pattern (best-effort - parses jobs/steps; note the YAML 1.1 gotcha where the
  bare `on:` key parses as boolean `True`, handled in `_on_triggers`). In
  `build_repo` (the `FLEET_TOKEN` scan context), for each fork
  `needs-ci-approval` PR: if the verdict is `safe` (no risky files, no posture,
  no read error) and auto-approve is enabled or the author is excluded as
  owner/maintainer/bot, call `approve_ci`; `approved` and verified `noop` both emit NO card
  (log a `::notice::` to stderr - never stdout, which carries scan.json), while
  `hold`/`error`/throw fall back to a `ci-approval` card carrying the safety
  warning for contributor-authored PRs.
  Otherwise emit the `ci-approval` card exactly as before for contributor-authored
  PRs, carrying the safety warning.
  **Fail closed everywhere**: an unsafe verdict, a `hold`/`error` from the approve,
  or an approve that throws all fall back to a card for contributor-authored PRs;
  owner, maintainer, and bot-authored PRs are not approved and instead log
  `suppressed-card` with no decision card.
  `ci-approval` is fork-only: same-repo PRs with no CI signal route to
  `review-needed`, while unknown fork status fails safe by raising a manual
  `ci-approval` card with no auto-approve attempt for contributor-authored PRs
  and by logging `suppressed-card` for owner, maintainer, and bot-authored PRs.
  An `approve_ci` `noop` is a verified "nothing awaiting approval" state, so the
  scan emits no worklist item and reconcile consumes any stale card; if a real
  pending run appears on a later scan, the normal approve/card/suppressed-card
  path runs again.
  Fork-originated `action_required` workflow runs are expected to have an empty `workflow_run.pull_requests` list, so `approve_ci` verifies that fork case with the already-filtered run's exact `head_sha` plus `head_branch`; non-empty `pull_requests` stays strict and must contain exactly the target PR.
  **Observability (every outcome is logged, never silent).** `_auto_approve_or_card`
  returns `(handled, card_note, log_note)` and `build_repo` emits exactly ONE
  stderr line per `needs-ci-approval` PR the auto path handles: a `::notice::`
  when approved or verified no-op, else a `::warning::wheelhouse auto-approve
  carded <repo>#<pr>: <log_note>` for contributor-authored PRs or
  `::warning::wheelhouse auto-approve suppressed-card <repo>#<pr>: <log_note>`
  for owner, maintainer, and bot-authored PRs.
  The `log_note` always carries the `ci_safety` verdict `reason` and, when an approve was attempted, the
  `approve_ci` `status` + `message` (e.g. `error: <gh stderr>`, `hold`), so a real
  approve failure that used to be swallowed into the card body is now visible in
  the scan-step log - the next `scan-backstop` run shows exactly why each
  safe-looking PR was not approved. Unknown fork status is logged as a carded or
  suppressed-card warning with its uncertainty reason before safety is attempted.
  This is logging only: it never changes the verdict, the approve/card decision,
  token usage, or fail-closed behavior, the `card_note` going into
  `item["warning"]` for emitted cards is unchanged, and the line is gh
  stderr/status text, never a secret value.
  Idempotent by construction: once approved the next scan sees CI running/results
  (not `needs-ci-approval`), so it is not re-approved; a later push that adds a
  workflow file or flips the posture routes contributor-authored PRs back to a
  card and owner, maintainer, or bot-authored PRs to `suppressed-card`.
  The auto path
  runs ONLY on the `ok:true` success path of `build_repo` (an `ok:false` repo
  returns early), so an unknown-state repo is never auto-approved - the same
  invariant that bars closing its cards. Token discipline holds: the approve is a
  cross-repo write under `FLEET_TOKEN` (where scan already runs); the "no card"
  path performs no card write at all, and cards are still written later by
  `reconcile.py` under `GITHUB_TOKEN`. **Manual-path asymmetry:** risky files ->
  HARD HOLD (exit 4), unchanged; a `pull_request_target` posture does NOT
  hard-block the manual approve (`_approve_warning_suffix` only WARNS, because the
  `pull_request_target` run fires automatically with secrets regardless of this
  approval - blocking would only withhold the harmless read-only `pull_request`
  run). **Honest caveat (document, don't overclaim):** the approval gate covers
  the fork `pull_request` run; `pull_request_target` runs are NOT gated by it, so
  the posture check is a "don't silently auto-clear + make me aware" signal plus
  the loud exploit flag, not a direct block of that vector. **Config:**
  `auto_approve_ci` defaults to **`true`** when absent (so a fresh fork gets the
  noise reduction; set `false` to restore click-to-approve-everything), and a
  per-repo `auto_approve_ci: false` on any `repos:` entry overrides the global
  (`_auto_approve_enabled`). The warning is display-only (not a material refresh
  field), since a ci-approval card's existence/refresh is already driven by the
  PR's own head_sha/comp/tests.
- The `repository_dispatch` event type is `wheelhouse-item`, but `ingest.yml`
  also listens for the legacy `triage-item` (`types: [wheelhouse-item,
  triage-item]`). It is a cross-repo wire contract: source repos onboarded before
  the rename still send `triage-item`, so the alias must stay until every source
  dispatcher is updated. Same idea as the state-marker back-compat - rename the
  name, keep accepting the old one.
- **Cross-repo reference qualification.** A decision card lives in THIS
  (cards) repo, but its target is a DIFFERENT repo. GitHub autolinks a bare
  `#N` to an issue/PR in whichever repo the TEXT is posted in, so any
  model-generated free text landing on a card must never contain a bare `#N`
  meant for the target - it would silently mislink to the cards repo instead.
  Every surface where model text is rendered/posted onto a card runs it
  through the one shared, deterministic `wheelhouse_core.qualify_issue_refs(text,
  owner, repo)` first, which rewrites a bare GitHub-autolink `#N` to
  `owner/repo#N` (already-qualified `owner/repo#N`, full URLs, markdown-link
  URLs, and non-reference `#` uses like `GH-123`/`#123abc`/`foo#N` are left
  untouched; null-safe and idempotent). `owner` is always
  `GITHUB_REPOSITORY_OWNER` and `repo` is always the TARGET repo name from the
  card's deterministic state (`state["repo"]`) - NEVER derived from the
  model's own output, so the model cannot redirect qualification by naming a
  different repo in its text.
  The three live model-output surfaces: (1) auto-triage -
  `render_card.py`'s `triage_section`/`body_with_triage_result` thread
  `owner`+`state["repo"]` through before rendering the `### Triage` block (the
  `triage-apply`/`triage-fail` CLI read `GITHUB_REPOSITORY_OWNER` and
  `triage.yml`'s "Update the decision card" step passes it through its `env -i`
  sandbox); (2) deep-review - the "Post the verdict on the card" step in
  `deep-review.yml` imports `wheelhouse_core` in its trusted Python heredoc and
  qualifies the extracted verdict with the `resolve` step's deterministic
  `repo` output before `gh issue comment`; (3) NL answer/clarify -
  `apply_decision.route_decision` (the same trust-boundary function that
  validates the LLM's structured result) qualifies `out["answer"]` using the
  card's `state["repo"]` and a caller-supplied `owner` before returning, so
  `steps.route.outputs.answer` is already qualified by the time
  decision-handler.yml's "Post NL reply" step posts it - `cmd_nl_route` reads
  `GITHUB_REPOSITORY_OWNER` from env and the `route` step in
  decision-handler.yml passes it through its own `env -i` sandbox.
  The same helper also runs during `_preserve_same_revision_triage` on
  same-revision refreshes, so cached pre-qualification `### Triage` sections in
  already-open cards are repaired before being reinserted; this is a card-body
  sweep only and does not rewrite historical card comments.
  All three
  prompts (`triage.yml`, `deep-review.yml`, and the NL prompt in
  `apply_decision.build_nl_prompt`) also carry a defense-in-depth instruction
  telling the model to write refs as `owner/repo#N`, never bare - but the
  deterministic rewrite is the load-bearing guarantee, not the prompt. The
  merge thank-you comment posted on the TARGET repo's own PR (see
  "Contributor-facing copy") is deliberately OUT OF SCOPE - a bare `#N` there
  is correct because that comment is posted in the target repo itself.

## LLM side-jobs

Three independent LLM features share the same auth (a Claude **subscription** token
from `claude setup-token` via `anthropics/claude-code-action` - NOT an Anthropic
API key) and the same injection model (only trusted workflow prompts and
owner/maintainer-authored text are instructions; target content and optional
search output are delimited untrusted data; the LLM never gets `FLEET_TOKEN`):
Every `anthropics/claude-code-action` LLM step is pinned to `v1.0.161` at commit `fad22eb3fa582b7357fc0ea48af6645851b884fd` and passes `--model sonnet`.
The pinned release resolves `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` to `0.3.197`; on the Anthropic API, Claude Code versions v2.1.197 and later resolve `sonnet` to Sonnet 5.

- **`triage.yml` - automatic, lightweight, advisory PR-card OR issue-card context.** Triggered by `scan-backstop` / `reconcile.py` and the ingest fast path for pure `needs-decision` pr-review OR issue-triage cards whose current revision (a PR's `head_sha`, or an issue's `updated_at`) does not match `triaged_sha`; if the card is held under `pending-triage`, the update path also publishes its real checkboxes fail-open.
  pr-review is opt-out through `auto_triage`; issue-triage is opt-out through the INDEPENDENT `auto_triage_issues` - both global default true, per-repo override allowed, and both inert unless `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` is present. Neither flag affects the other.
  For a pr-review card it checks out the target PR head read-only with `FLEET_TOKEN`, `persist-credentials: false`, and verifies the head did not move since queueing.
  For an issue-triage card it checks out the repo's DEFAULT branch read-only the same way (same substrate `deep-review.yml` uses for an issue card) - there is no head to verify.
  Both paths then run Claude with lower `--max-turns` than deep-review to produce only structured `{summary, product_implications, recommended_next_step}` context; the issue-triage prompt fetches the issue's title/body/comments (no diff) and asks for an issue-appropriate recommendation, while the pr-review prompt keeps the PR title/body/diff and merge-oriented recommendation - unchanged from before this feature.
  It writes the visible `### Triage` section by a trusted workflow step with `github.token`, never by Claude, and the result is advisory only.
  Apart from publishing a held card's own `pending-triage` label and placeholder decision section, it never changes classification, labels, checkbox options, `apply_decision.py`, merge/close/approve behavior, fork-CI safety, author filtering, or conflict routing.
  Before dispatch, the queueing path writes `triaged_sha=<current revision>` and `triage_status=queued`, so errors and timeouts fail open without retriggering the same revision on every scan.
  Existing open cards of either kind with no `triaged_sha` are intentionally stale and backfill once on the next eligible scan.
  Optional `READONLY_TOKEN` search uses the unchanged `wheelhouse-search` wrapper and remains untrusted evidence only.
  The Claude action allows only `github-actions[bot]`, never `*`, because scan/ingest dispatches use `github.token`.
  `render_card.py triage-apply`/`triage-fail` take a kind-agnostic `--revision` CLI argument (a PR's head SHA or an issue's `updated_at`), replacing the old pr-review-only `--head-sha` flag name.
- **`deep-review.yml` - ALWAYS-ON, code-grounded (no enable flag).** Triggered by ticking the **Investigate** box on a card, by the repo owner applying the `needs-deep-review` label, or by the repo owner running `workflow_dispatch` with only `issue=...` for direct verification.
  Bot-dispatched Investigate runs use the immutable target inputs passed by `decision-handler.yml`; owner issue-only runs and manual label runs parse the current card body with `github.token`.
  It checks out the TARGET's code read-only (`FLEET_TOKEN`, `persist-credentials: false`, the PR head for a review card / the default branch for an issue card) and runs Claude restricted to `--allowedTools Read,Grep,Glob` over that checkout when search is disabled - so it traces real code paths, never just the diff, and can NEVER execute the target's code.
  When `READONLY_TOKEN` is absent, this remains the legacy no-search path: no shell `GH_TOKEN`, no Bash tool, and `github_token: github.token`.
  When `READONLY_TOKEN` is present, Claude also uses that read-only public-scoped token as both the action `github_token` input and shell `GH_TOKEN`, plus `Write` for `search-request.json` and `Bash(wheelhouse-search)`.
  The wrapper is still the existing `scripts/nl_readonly_search.py` install path, scoped to the target repo plus configured fleet repos, so deep-review can cross-reference related, duplicate, or superseding PRs/issues and code context.
  Search output is UNTRUSTED DATA and advisory evidence only; the model still produces only verdict text, and `FLEET_TOKEN` never reaches it.
  No deterministic downstream step reads model-written files because verdict capture uses the action `execution_file` result event.
  Claude does not write a verdict file.
  The Claude action allows only `github-actions[bot]` as a bot actor so the maintainer-gated Investigate dispatch can pass; it must not allow `*` or any external bot actor.
  Its final response is captured from the action's `execution_file` output by preferring the clean `type: "result"` event's `result` string, falling back to the last assistant text, and the trusted workflow step posts that text as a card comment with `github.token`.
  If no usable output is present, the workflow posts "Deep review ran but produced no verdict (see the workflow run logs)." and fails the run.
  The ONLY gate is `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`: when it is ABSENT the workflow posts a one-line "Deep-review needs CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN configured to run." note instead of silently no-opping.
  Manual triggering means there is no runaway-cost reason for a config flag, so the old `deep_review` flag was removed entirely - config, `load_config`, and the `deep-review-enabled` CLI.
- **`nl_decisions`** in `decision-handler.yml`: a plain-English owner comment is
  mapped to a structured result (see Sharp edges).
  Opt-in: inert unless `nl_decisions: true` AND `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`
  present.
  `READONLY_TOKEN` is optional.
  If it is absent, Claude stays in the legacy `--allowedTools Write` mode, writes
  only `decision.json`, and runs no commands.
  If it is present, Claude also uses `READONLY_TOKEN` as the action
  `github_token` input and shell `GH_TOKEN`, plus the
  `Bash(wheelhouse-search)` allow-list so it can run scoped read-only `gh`
  searches across the target repo and configured fleet repos for related,
  duplicate, or superseding PRs/issues and code context.
  Because `READONLY_TOKEN` is a fine-grained, public-read PAT, it cannot answer
  `claude-code-action`'s own `GET .../collaborators/{actor}/permission`
  triggering-actor check, so that read-only branch also sets
  `allowed_non_write_users: ${{ github.event.sender.login }}` to bypass that
  check - narrowly, for the exact sender the workflow's own `steps.gate`
  (`wheelhouse_core.py authorized`) has already proven is the owner or
  configured maintainer, never `'*'`. That workflow gate remains the real
  trust boundary; the action's built-in check is redundant once it has run.
  This does not touch what token the model can act with - `github_token`/
  `GH_TOKEN` stay `READONLY_TOKEN`, so the model still cannot write anywhere.
  Do not widen `allowed_non_write_users` to `'*'` or drop the `steps.gate`
  authorization it relies on.
  The prompt carries the card's prior thread as owner-scoped conversation history
  so follow-up questions keep continuity (see the conversation-memory bullet in
  Sharp edges for the trusted-author rule).
  Deep-review uses the same wrapper under the same optional `READONLY_TOKEN`
  trust model, but only for advisory verdict context.

## Contributor-facing copy

Messages Wheelhouse posts onto **target repos** (e.g. a rebase nudge on a contributor's PR) speak naturally, like a friendly maintainer bot.
They must not name the product ("Wheelhouse") or use internal-state jargon ("maintainer queue", "resurface", bucket/kind names).

Owner-facing decision cards and comments on **this repo's** issues are the private queue; those may keep the Wheelhouse name and internal vocabulary.

**The one sanctioned contributor `@`-mention.** `do_merge` in `apply_decision.py` posts a short, friendly thank-you comment on a fleet contributor's PR after a successful card-driven merge (checkbox `merge` or NL "merge it"), `@`-mentioning the contributor by `pr["user"]["login"]`.
This is a deliberate, narrow exception to "never `@`-mention" - that rule is about the owner's private decision cards in *this* repo, never about a comment posted on the *contributor's own* target-repo PR, where a thank-you tag is normal OSS etiquette.
It is gated by `thank_on_merge` (default true, per-repo override via `wheelhouse_core._thank_on_merge_enabled`, mirroring `auto_approve_ci`); no LLM is involved and `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` is irrelevant to it.
The message is either the built-in default or the owner's own `thank_on_merge_message` config (an `{author}` placeholder substituted with the trusted bare login; templates include `@{author}` when they want a GitHub mention, never with untrusted target content); a per-repo message override wins over the global one (`wheelhouse_core._thank_on_merge_message`).
Owner, configured-maintainer, and bot (`*[bot]` login suffix) authors are skipped silently, as is a missing/blank author.
It runs on the same `FLEET_TOKEN` acting path as the merge itself (`_comment_target`, no new token) and strictly AFTER the `PUT .../merge` succeeds - never on already-merged/not-open/head-moved/failed-merge outcomes.
It is best-effort by construction (`_thank_contributor` swallows every exception to a `::warning::` and always leaves `do_merge`'s success result - `("Merged ...", "resolved")` - untouched): a thank-you failure must never flip a successful merge to `error`/`blocked` or trigger a retry.

## Validation

No build step.
Validate with `python -m py_compile scripts/*.py tests/*.py`.
Run the unit tests:
- `python tests/test_decision.py` - mocks the LLM, no network, and also covers the non-consuming investigate routing, allow-set, `clear_checkbox`, the `thank_on_merge` post-merge thank-you (config on/off, per-repo override, owner/maintainer/bot skip, custom-message substitution, best-effort swallow, and every non-success merge outcome posting none), that `route_decision` qualifies bare cross-repo refs in `answer`/`clarify` replies using `STATE["repo"]` + owner, never the model's own text, and that a HELD card (render_card.py "Held cards") is inert to `cmd_parse` (checkbox tick and slash-command alike) and `cmd_nl_eligible`, while the identical card once published is actionable again.
- `python tests/test_nl_decisions_search.py` - offline YAML wiring checks for the optional READONLY_TOKEN search path, scoped actor-check bypass, token isolation, prompt gating, unchanged `nl-route`/`execute` boundary, the `GITHUB_REPOSITORY_OWNER` threading into the `route` step's `env -i` sandbox, the NL prompt's cross-repo-qualification instruction, and that `route_decision` qualification is driven by deterministic state rather than model-claimed repos.
- `python tests/test_card_refresh.py` - the card-refresh change-detection, refreshability-guard, and label-replace logic, pure functions, no network; also covers the `CARD_RENDER_VERSION` 1 -> 2 retroactive triage-ref-qualification propagation: a render-version-behind card with a bare-ref cached `### Triage` section gets it qualified and stamped `render_version=2` on the next refresh, a card already at `render_version=2` with already-qualified triage is a full no-op, already-qualified refs/URLs/markdown links/non-ref `#` uses in the preserved section are left untouched, and qualification is driven by `GITHUB_REPOSITORY_OWNER` + the card's own state repo rather than the item or model text.
- `python tests/test_reconcile.py` - reconcile routing and stale-card self-healing, no network.
- `python tests/test_merge_conflict.py` - mergeability fail-open vs CONFLICTING routing, idempotent rebase nudges, author-filter nudge skips, and reconcile self-healing for conflicted PR cards, no network.
- `python tests/test_ci_autoapprove.py` - the shared `ci_safety` verdict, `pull_request_target` posture detection, and the auto-approve-vs-card routing plus scan-log observability in `build_repo`, all with the network-touching helpers stubbed.
- `python tests/test_author_filter.py` - queue author filtering across PR review, CI approval, and issue triage, plus open-issue/PR/closing-reference pagination guards, no network.
- `python tests/test_auto_triage.py` - automatic PR-card AND issue-card triage: `auto_triage`/`auto_triage_issues` config defaults/overrides/independence, per-revision (`head_sha`/`updated_at`) cache and legacy-card backfill for both kinds, rendered section/no-mention behavior for both kinds, reconcile/ingest dispatch gates including same-pass newly-created-card queueing by issue number, `triage.yml` token isolation including the issue-triage default-branch/no-head-verify path, and cross-repo ref qualification in the rendered `### Triage` section (`triage_section`/`body_with_triage_result` owner threading, the `triage.yml` prompt's qualification instruction, and `GITHUB_REPOSITORY_OWNER` reaching both `triage-apply`/`triage-fail` through the `env -i` sandbox), all offline. Also covers held cards for both kinds: `should_hold` gating parity with `should_auto_triage`, the placeholder render (no `opt:` markers, `pending-triage` label, `held` state key, `needs-decision` retained), `upsert_card` creating held only when triage would actually be queued, preserving held-ness while refresh eligibility still holds, publishing silently when refreshed eligibility turns off, a no-op refresh when unchanged, `update_card_triage` publishing on success AND on failure (fail-open), a stale-revision publish attempt being a no-op, unheld-card behavior staying byte-for-byte unchanged, reconcile self-healing a held card whose target closed, the dispatch-failure fail-open publish added to both `reconcile.py` and the `queue-triage` CLI, and the `triage-recover` fail-open safety net (`triage.yml`'s final `always()` recovery step wiring, and the CLI publishing a card genuinely stuck held+queued for its exact revision while being a no-op for a never-held card, an already-published card, or one queued for a different/superseded revision).
- `python tests/test_deep_review.py` - the always-on/code-grounded deep-review and Investigate wiring: render options, the removed enable flag, the token-absent note, the `persist-credentials: false` checkout plus read-only tool isolation, the narrow `allowed_bots`, the optional READONLY_TOKEN-gated `wheelhouse-search` wiring, the action-output verdict capture, issue-only manual dispatch, the handler's immutable-input `workflow_dispatch` trigger, and the "Post the verdict" step's `qualify_issue_refs` call (with the deterministic `TARGET_REPO`/`GITHUB_REPOSITORY_OWNER` inputs) running before the `gh issue comment` post, plus the prompt's qualification instruction, all by inspecting the scripts/YAML, no network.
- `python tests/test_workflow_lint.py` - a regression guard that scans every `.github/workflows/*.yml` `run:` step for a `gh api` invocation combining `--slurp` with `--jq` (mutually exclusive in the installed `gh` CLI - `gh api --slurp` yields an array of per-page arrays and must instead be piped into a standalone `jq`), no network.
- `python tests/test_qualify_refs.py` - direct unit tests for `wheelhouse_core.qualify_issue_refs` (bare `#N` -> `owner/repo#N`, already-qualified/URL/markdown-link/`GH-123`/`#123abc` left untouched, multiple refs in one string, `None`/empty safety, idempotency, and that qualification is driven by the caller-supplied slug rather than any repo the text itself names), no network.
YAML-parse `.github/workflows/*.yml` plus `wheelhouse.config.yml` plus `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/*.yml`.
Run `actionlint` if available; fetch the binary via its `download-actionlint.bash` if not.
The live LLM paths (auto triage, deep-review, nl_decisions) can only be exercised end-to-end in CI with the token set and, for nl_decisions, the flag on.
Secrets the maintainer must add: `FLEET_TOKEN` always, `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` for auto triage/deep-review and/or nl_decisions, and optionally `READONLY_TOKEN` public-read only for auto triage, nl_decisions, and deep-review search.
