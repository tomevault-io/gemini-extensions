# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with
code in this repository.

## Documentation

**IMPORTANT: The authoritative API reference is in `doc_classes/*.xml`.** These
XML files are the single source of truth for all exposed classes, methods,
constants, and their parameters. They are compiled into the GDExtension and
appear in Godot's built-in help system.

When working with this codebase:
1. **Always consult `doc_classes/` for accurate API signatures** - method names,
   parameter types, default values, and return types
2. Keep CLAUDE.md examples up-to-date with the doc_classes/ API
3. Update doc_classes/ XML files when adding or modifying public APIs
4. Use `godot --doctool` to regenerate documentation after API changes

**Common API patterns:**
- To get a string from the stack: Use `to_string_inplace(index)`, NOT `to_string(index)`
- To get any value as a Variant: Use `to_variant(index)`
- To set a global: Use `set_global(key)` after pushing the value (NOT `set_global(key, value)`)

## Project Overview

A Godot 4.5+ GDExtension that integrates the Luau scripting language (Lua
derivative) into Godot Engine.

**Core Classes:**

- `Luau`: Static class that compiles Luau source code to bytecode
- `LuaState`: Manages a Lua VM instance, executes bytecode, and provides
  debugging support via single-step execution
- `LuauScript`: Resource type for managing Luau scripts as Godot resources
- Math type bindings in `lua_godotlib.h/cpp`: Bridge between Godot math types
  and Luau. Vector3 uses Luau's native vector type for high performance. Other
  types (Vector2, Vector4, Color, etc.) use userdata with metatables for
  operators and property access.
- `LuaCallable` in `lua_callable.h/cpp`: Wraps Lua functions as Godot Callables,
  enabling bidirectional callable bridging between Godot and Luau. Uses manual
  reference counting to manage LuaState lifetime.
- **Lua threads**: LuaState supports Lua threads (coroutines) via `new_thread()`
  and `to_thread()` methods. Thread LuaState instances share globals with the
  parent but have independent stacks. Thread lifecycles are managed via Godot's
  reference counting.

## Building

Build the preset appropriate for the current platform—for example:

```bash
cmake --preset windows-x86_64-debug
cmake --build --preset windows-x86_64-debug -j
```

```bash
cmake --preset linux-x86_64-debug
cmake --build --preset linux-x86_64-debug -j
```

```bash
cmake --preset macos-arm64-debug
cmake --build --preset macos-arm64-debug -j
```

Built binaries output to `build/bin/` and are automatically copied to
`demo/addons/luau_gdextension/bin/`

Dependencies (auto-fetched via CMake, stored in `build/_deps/`):

- Luau from https://github.com/luau-lang/luau.git
- godot-cpp from https://github.com/godotengine/godot-cpp.git

## Demo Project

The `demo/` directory contains a working Godot project demonstrating usage. See
`demo/main.gd` for example integration code and `demo/test_script.luau` for a
sample Luau script.

## Architecture

**Key Design Patterns:**

- LuaState wraps a Luau VM and manages its lifecycle
- **Vector3 performance optimization:** Vector3 is bridged to Luau's native
  `vector` type, which provides:
  - Inline arithmetic operations in the VM (no C function calls for +, -, *, /)
  - JIT compilation support for vector operations
  - Better memory layout (stored inline in stack, not as heap allocations)
  - Lower GC pressure
- Other math types are implemented as userdata with metatables
- **Callable bridging:** Bidirectional conversion between Lua functions and
  Godot Callables:
  - Lua functions → Godot Callables: Wrapped in `LuaCallable` class using manual
    reference counting to keep LuaState alive
  - Godot Callables → Lua: Stored as userdata with `__call` metamethod
  - Error handling: Prints errors and returns nil on failure
  - Multiple returns: Returns first value with warning
- **Thread support:** Lua threads (coroutines) for cooperative multitasking:
  - `new_thread()` creates a thread and pushes it to the stack
  - `to_thread(index)` converts stack value to a LuaState wrapper
  - Threads keep parent alive via reference counting
  - Explicit `parent.close()` invalidates all child threads
  - Threads share global state but have independent execution stacks
  - Creating new wrapper from same thread is safe (independent ref counting)
- All Lua execution happens on a single OS thread (Lua threads are cooperative, not OS threads)

## Testing

This project has comprehensive automated tests using CMake's CTest framework.

**Test Infrastructure:**

- **C++ Tests (doctest):** Embedded in Debug builds of the GDExtension library
  - Located in `tests/test_*.cpp` (math types, arrays, dictionaries, variants,
    threads, etc.)
  - Tests both POD types (Vector2, Color) and runtime types (Array, Dictionary,
    Variant)
  - Built as separate library `gdluau_tests` when `BUILD_TESTING=ON` (enabled
    in Debug presets)
  - Has its own `.gdextension` file for independent loading
  - Run inside Godot runtime for full engine integration
- **GDScript Integration Tests:** High-level tests from Godot's perspective
  - Located in `demo/test/test_*_integration.gd`
  - Tests full round-trip conversions and Lua script execution
  - Run via `test_loader.gd` script

**Building with Tests:**

```bash
# Debug build includes test library (BUILD_TESTING=ON)
cmake --preset windows-x86_64-debug   # or linux-x86_64-debug, macos-arm64-debug
cmake --build --preset windows-x86_64-debug -j

# Release build excludes tests (BUILD_TESTING=OFF)
cmake --preset windows-x86_64-release
cmake --build --preset windows-x86_64-release -j
```

**Running Tests:**

```bash
# Using CTest (recommended)
ctest --preset windows-x86_64-debug   # or linux-x86_64-debug, macos-arm64-debug

# Or directly via Godot
godot --headless --path demo/ -- --run-tests
```

**Test Architecture:** Main library (`gdluau`) never contains test code, even
in Debug builds. Test library (`gdluau_tests`) is a separate GDExtension with
its own `.gdextension` file, only built when `BUILD_TESTING=ON`. Test library
is completely optional and can be excluded from distributions. CTest drives test
execution via Godot with `--run-tests` flag.

**Coverage:**

- ✅ All math types (Vector2, Vector2i, Vector3, Vector3i, Color, Vector4, etc.)
- ✅ Array/Dictionary bridging (including nested structures)
- ✅ Variant conversions (all supported types)
- ✅ Array vs Dictionary detection logic
- ✅ Callable bridging (Lua functions ↔ Godot Callables)
- ✅ Lua threads (coroutine support, lifecycle management)
- ✅ Edge cases and error handling

See `tests/README.md` for detailed testing documentation and best practices.

**When Adding New Features:**

1. Write C++ tests in `tests/test_*.cpp` (create new test file or add to
   existing)
2. Write GDScript integration tests in `demo/test/`
3. Run `ctest --preset <preset>` to verify all tests pass
4. CI automatically runs tests on push/PR (via CTest)

**Distribution:** When packaging for distribution, simply exclude
`*_tests*` files from `demo/addons/luau_gdextension/`. This removes both the
test library binaries and the `luau_tests.gdextension` file.

## Important Notes

**Critical: Always use `call_deferred()` when resuming from signal handlers to
prevent reentrancy crashes:**

```gdscript
func _on_step(state: LuaState) -> void:
    # Do work...
    state.resume.call_deferred()  # Correct
    # state.resume()  # WRONG - will crash
```

### Lua Thread Usage

**Creating and using threads:**

```gdscript
var state = LuaState.new()
state.open_libs()
state.do_string("function coro() coroutine.yield(1); return 2 end", "define_coro")

# Create thread
var thread = state.new_thread()  # Pushes thread to stack
state.pop(1)  # Clean up stack

# Execute coroutine in thread
thread.get_global("coro")
assert(thread.resume(0) == Luau.LUA_YIELD)  # Yields 1
print(thread.to_number(-1))  # Prints 1
thread.pop(1)

assert(thread.resume(0) == Luau.LUA_OK)  # Returns 2
print(thread.to_number(-1))  # Prints 2
```

**Important thread lifecycle rules:**

1. **Shared globals, separate stacks**: Threads share the global environment but
   have independent execution stacks
2. **Reference counting**: Threads keep the parent state alive via reference
   counting, preventing premature GC
3. **Explicit close**: Calling `parent.close()` explicitly invalidates ALL child
   threads, even if they're still referenced
4. **Don't close threads**: Calling `thread.close()` warns and invalidates the
   pointer but doesn't affect the parent
5. **Multiple wrappers OK**: Creating multiple LuaState wrappers for the same
   thread is safe - they each independently ref-count the parent

## Documentation

This project uses Godot's GDExtension documentation system (Godot 4.3+) to provide
built-in documentation for all exposed classes and methods.

### Documentation Structure

Documentation files are located in `doc_classes/*.xml` and follow Godot's XML
documentation format. These files are automatically compiled into the extension
and appear in the Godot editor's built-in help system.

**Available classes:**

- `Luau.xml` - Static compiler class
- `LuaState.xml` - Lua VM state management
- `LuauScript.xml` - Script resource type
- `ResourceFormatLoaderLuauScript.xml` - Resource loader
- `ResourceFormatSaverLuauScript.xml` - Resource saver

### Generating Initial Documentation

To generate or update XML documentation files after adding new classes or methods:

```bash
cd /path/to/luau-gdextension/demo
godot --doctool ../ --gdextension-docs
```

This command:

1. Runs Godot's documentation tool on the GDExtension
2. Generates XML files for all exposed classes
3. Places them in `doc_classes/` in the root

### Building with Documentation

Documentation is automatically compiled into the extension during the build
process. The CMake build system:

1. Finds all `doc_classes/*.xml` files
2. Generates a C++ source file (`build/gen/doc_source.cpp`) containing the docs
3. Compiles it into the extension library

This happens automatically for all build configurations (Debug and Release).

### Editing Documentation

Documentation files use BBCode-style formatting. Common tags:

- `[b]bold[/b]` - Bold text
- `[i]italic[/i]` - Italic text
- `[code]code[/code]` - Inline code
- `[codeblock]...[/codeblock]` - Code blocks
- `[param name]` - Reference to a parameter
- `[method name]` - Reference to a method
- `[constant NAME]` - Reference to a constant
- `[enum EnumName]` - Reference to an enum

**Example method documentation:**

```xml
<method name="do_string">
    <return type="int" enum="lua_Status" />
    <param index="0" name="code" type="String" />
    <param index="1" name="chunk_name" type="String" />
    <description>
        Compiles and executes Luau source code. Returns [constant LUA_OK] on success.
        The [param chunk_name] is used for error messages and debugging.
        [codeblock]
        var state = LuaState.new()
        state.open_libs()
        state.do_string("return 1 + 2", "example")
        print(state.to_number(-1))  # Prints 3
        [/codeblock]
    </description>
</method>
```

### Viewing Documentation

Once built, documentation appears in Godot 4.3+ editor:

1. **Script editor**: Ctrl+Click on a class/method name
2. **Help menu**: Search > "LuaState" (or any class name)
3. **Code completion**: Shows brief descriptions in tooltips

### Adding Documentation for New Features

When adding new classes or methods:

1. Build the extension first (so classes are registered)
2. Run `godot --doctool` to regenerate XML files
3. Edit the XML files to add descriptions, examples, and formatting
4. Rebuild the extension to include the new documentation

### Documentation Best Practices

- **Brief description**: One-sentence summary of what the class/method does
- **Description**: Detailed explanation with usage notes
- **Code examples**: Include practical examples in `[codeblock]` tags
- **Cross-references**: Link related methods, parameters, and constants
- **Parameter documentation**: Explain what each parameter does
- **Return values**: Document what the method returns and when
