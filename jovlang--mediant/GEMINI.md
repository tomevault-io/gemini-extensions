## mediant

> Mediant is a minimal Org-mode parser and agenda viewer. It parses a focused subset of Org syntax and renders a responsive rolling 7-day agenda in HTML/CSS. It runs in two modes: a **static mode** where users paste Org content into a textarea (localStorage-backed), and a **server mode** where a local Node CLI (`mediant <file.org>`) serves the UI and streams the configured Org file over `/api/source` + SSE. No framework dependencies.

## Project overview

Mediant is a minimal Org-mode parser and agenda viewer. It parses a focused subset of Org syntax and renders a responsive rolling 7-day agenda in HTML/CSS. It runs in two modes: a **static mode** where users paste Org content into a textarea (localStorage-backed), and a **server mode** where a local Node CLI (`mediant <file.org>`) serves the UI and streams the configured Org file over `/api/source` + SSE. No framework dependencies.

## Architecture

Three clearly separated stages — do not collapse them:

```
  .org file → Parser (org/) → Agenda (agenda/)    → UI (ui/)
              OrgEntry[]       AgendaWeek            HTML/CSS
                               DeadlineItem[]
                               OverdueItem[]
                               SomedayItem[]
```

- **Parser output types** (`src/org/`) reflect Org source faithfully
- **Agenda types** (`src/agenda/`) reflect UI needs (render categories, 7-day structure)
- Classification into display categories happens at the agenda stage, never during parsing

## Key source files

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `src/org/timestamp.ts` | Timestamp parsing, Date conversion, recurrence expansion, per-occurrence exception application. **Only** module that does date arithmetic. Exports both `expandRecurrences()` (pure base series) and `expandOccurrences()` (base series with exceptions applied). |
| `src/org/parser.ts` | Line-by-line Org parser → `OrgEntry[]`. Delegates all timestamp work to `timestamp.ts`. Reads `:EXCEPTION-<date>:`, `:EXCEPTION-NOTE-<date>:`, and `:SERIES-UNTIL:` keys inside `:PROPERTIES:` drawers; every other drawer and every other property key is skipped. |
| `src/org/model.ts` | Parser output types: `OrgEntry` (including `seriesUntil`), `OrgPlanning`, `TodoState`, `Priority`, `CheckboxItem`, `RecurrenceOverride`, `RecurrenceException`. |
| `src/org/drawer.ts` | Property-drawer text mutation helpers (`upsertProperty`, `removeProperty`). Operate on raw source strings; preserve key order and other drawer content; used by the edit panel to write exception properties. |
| `src/org/sourceEdit.ts` | Pure raw-source mutation helpers used by UI actions: replace an entry block while preserving body text, toggle TODO/DONE, advance repeating timestamps when marking done, toggle checkbox state, and update progress cookies. |
| `src/agenda/model.ts` | Agenda/render types: `AgendaItem`, `AgendaDay`, `AgendaWeek`, `DeadlineItem`, `OverdueItem`, `SomedayItem`, `RenderCategory`, `AgendaItemOverride`. |
| `src/agenda/generate.ts` | 7-day generation from a start date, recurrence expansion with exceptions (bounded to requested range), classification, sorting, overdue/someday collection. |
| `src/dateLabels.ts` | Shared English day/month labels for agenda headers and date formatting. Keep display labels centralized here instead of duplicating arrays. |
| `src/ui/render.ts` | DOM rendering from `AgendaWeek` + `DeadlineItem[]` + `OverdueItem[]`. Renders the per-occurrence override chip, instance note, active tag-filter state, and tag color-mode UI. |
| `src/ui/tagColors.ts` | Dynamic tag color management. Auto-assigns from palette, persists in localStorage. |
| `src/ui/notifications.ts` | Browser notification preference, permission request, and timer scheduling for timed events happening today. Notifications fire 1 hour before the start time and are rescheduled on render. |
| `src/ui/style.css` | All styles. CSS grid layout with content-width time column. |
| `src/main.ts` | Entry point. Probes `/api/source` on boot; if present, enters server mode (hydrates from the server, subscribes to `/api/events` for external file changes). Otherwise shows the textarea input screen backed by localStorage. Owns global keyboard shortcuts, tag-filter state, tag color mode, quick-capture overlay, add-item & edit-item panels, and the "This occurrence" section that writes exception properties via the drawer helpers. |
| `server/cli.mjs` | Node CLI + HTTP server. `mediant <file.org> [--port N] [--daemon]`. Serves `dist/` plus `GET/PUT /api/source` (with `If-Match` version checks) and `GET /api/events` SSE backed by `fs.watch`. Node built-ins only, no deps. |
| `elisp/mediant-org-agenda.el` | Optional Emacs Org agenda integration. Global minor mode that runs on `org-agenda-finalize-hook`, reads Mediant exception properties from source headings, filters cancelled/cutoff occurrences, inserts moved synthetic agenda lines, and renders exception notes. |
| `elisp/mediant-org-agenda-test.el` | ERT tests for the optional Org agenda integration. Uses temporary Org files and real `org-agenda-list` generation to verify exception display behavior. |

## Commands

```sh
npm test              # run all tests (vitest)
npm run test:watch    # vitest in watch mode
npx vite              # dev server (serves index.html)
npm run build         # build dist/ for the server to serve
npm start <file.org>  # build + start the local server against a file
emacs --batch -L elisp -f batch-byte-compile elisp/mediant-org-agenda.el
                      # byte-compile the optional Org agenda integration
emacs --batch -L elisp -l elisp/mediant-org-agenda-test.el -f ert-run-tests-batch-and-exit
                      # run ERT tests for the optional Org agenda integration
```

## Change workflow

- Update docs only for meaningful behavior, workflow, architecture, persistence, or data-model changes.
- Keep small spacing/styling polish out of high-level docs unless it changes an explicit documented UI contract.
- Mention minor visual polish in the commit message instead of README/AGENTS.
- Commit completed changes with a verbose commit message that explains the behavior change, persistence or data-model impact, and test coverage.

## Server mode

- `server/cli.mjs` is a self-contained Node script — no dependencies beyond Node built-ins (`http`, `fs`, `child_process`, etc.). Do not add npm deps to it casually.
- Version token is `mtimeMs` as a string. Client sends `If-Match: <version>` on `PUT /api/source`; mismatch → 409, client reloads from disk (disk wins).
- `fs.watch` fires multiple times per write on some platforms — the watcher is debounced 100 ms and only broadcasts on real `mtimeMs` changes.
- SSE clients receive `data: <version>\n\n`; the client ignores events whose version matches its own (so it doesn't reload after its own PUT).
- Server binds to `127.0.0.1` only. Auth is intentionally absent — the assumption is Tailscale or equivalent for remote access.
- `--daemon` re-execs the same node script detached with `MEDIANT_CHILD=1` and the flag stripped, then the parent prints the PID and exits. Stop with `kill <pid>`.

## Design principles

- **Parser types stay close to Org semantics.** `OrgEntry` mirrors the source. No display logic leaks in.
- **Timestamps store strings, not Dates.** `date` is `"2026-04-07"`, times are `"15:15"`. Conversion happens via helpers in `timestamp.ts`.
- **Recurrence expansion is always bounded.** `expandRecurrences()` and `expandOccurrences()` only generate occurrences within a given date range. Never expand globally.
- **Exceptions are keyed by base date, not final date.** A rescheduled occurrence on Tue 12 May still lives under `:EXCEPTION-2026-05-11:` if the base series hit Mon 11 May. UI labels reflect final date/time; property writes round-trip through the unshifted base slot.
- **Exceptions on non-repeating entries are parsed but inert.** `entry.exceptions` is populated regardless of whether the entry has a repeater; expansion simply never runs. Do not "fix" this by applying the map to the single timestamp.
- **`:SERIES-UNTIL:` is exclusive and base-slot-based.** An occurrence whose base date equals `seriesUntil` is not generated; the successor heading (if any) may start *on* that date without overlap. Reschedules keyed at/after the end are ignored because the base slot no longer exists, but a valid base slot before `seriesUntil` may still be moved past the cutoff. Like exceptions, it is parsed-but-inert on non-repeating entries.
- **New property drawers must stay Org-compatible.** When creating a drawer, place it immediately after the heading and any planning lines, before body text or standalone active timestamp lines. The parser and optional Elisp integration still read legacy drawers later in an entry, but new writes should work with Org's property APIs.
- **Override is behaviour, note is metadata.** A single occurrence can carry both (e.g. `shift +45m` + a note, or `cancelled` + a note). A cancelled+note pair is intentionally allowed.
- **All dates use local time.** No timezone handling — Org files don't encode timezones.
- **Only `TODO` and `DONE` states are recognized.** Other keywords (WAITING, NEXT, etc.) are treated as part of the heading title.
- **Readonly data structures.** Types use `readonly` throughout — data flows between stages, never mutated in place.

## Org syntax scope

See `ORG-SYNTAX.md` for the full breakdown of supported, gracefully ignored, and unsupported syntax.

**Supported (standard Org):** headings, TODO/DONE, priority cookies (`[#A]`/`[#B]`/`[#C]`), tags, active timestamps, time ranges, repeaters (`+`/`.+`/`++`, units `d`/`w`/`m`/`y`), SCHEDULED, DEADLINE, body text, checkbox lists (`- [ ]`/`- [X]`), progress cookies (`[2/3]`/`[66%]`).

**Mediant-specific extensions:** per-occurrence recurrence exceptions via `:EXCEPTION-<date>:` / `:EXCEPTION-NOTE-<date>:` (keyed on the *unshifted* base date), plus `:SERIES-UNTIL:` for an exclusive end date on a repeating series. `SERIES-UNTIL` is evaluated on the repeater's base slots, not the final moved-to date, which is what makes split-series handoff work cleanly. Both ride on ordinary Org property-drawer syntax, so files remain valid Org (Emacs opens and edits them without complaint — it just treats the keys as arbitrary properties).

**Gracefully ignored:** file keywords (#+), inactive timestamps, drawers (including property drawers — only the `:EXCEPTION-…:`, `:EXCEPTION-NOTE-…:`, and `:SERIES-UNTIL:` extension keys are read), comments, links, inline markup, plain lists, tables.

**Not supported:** diary sexp, custom TODO keywords, tag inheritance, habits, clocking.

## UI structure

- **Overdue section** at the very top — TODO items past their DEADLINE or SCHEDULED date, sorted most overdue first. Shows days overdue + kind badge (DEADLINE/SCHEDULED) + clickable TODO badge before the title. Red-accented border and labels.
- **Upcoming deadlines section** below overdue (global, not per-day). Due text is rendered as `Today` or compact day counts like `12d`, with urgency colors that progress from red to orange to yellow to a calmer tone as the due date gets farther away.
- **Day cards** (7 consecutive days starting from today), each containing:
  - All-day section (holidays, birthdays — no label, title flush left)
  - Deadline items (DEADLINE badge + title, time shown if present)
  - Timed events (time column + title + tag badges, tag-colored left border)
  - Scheduled tasks inline with events (time → TODO badge → title)
- **DONE items** rendered at `opacity: 0.7` in muted text (`var(--text-done)`)
- **Today** indicated by blue border + small blue dot (not a text badge)
- **Day headings** are clickable/focusable controls. Activating a day heading opens the add-item panel in Event mode with that day prefilled in the When field.
- **Hide empty days** — toolbar toggle removes day blocks with no visible agenda items. If no day blocks remain, the day-card container is not rendered. Preference persists in localStorage (`mediant-hide-empty-days`).
- **Hide completed & skipped** — toolbar toggle filters out DONE entries and `skipped` (cancelled-occurrence) items from the day cards, and drops DONE entries from the someday section. Filtering happens in `renderAgendaBase` after tag filtering, so it composes with `Hide empty days` (filtered days that fall to zero items collapse). Overdue and upcoming-deadlines collectors already restrict to TODO/non-cancelled items, so they need no extra filter. Preference persists in localStorage (`mediant-hide-completed`).
- **Tags** rendered as colored badge pills, right-aligned. Colors auto-assigned from a palette and persisted in localStorage (`mediant-tag-colors`).
- **Tag color rendering** — tag badges, tag picker pills/swatches, and tag-colored left fringes share the same visual transform: light mode displays a softened `color-mix(... 20%, white)` version of the stored tag color, while dark mode uses the raw tag color. Render code should set CSS variables (`--tag-color`, `--tag-fringe-color`, `--global-row-fringe-color`) and let CSS handle theme transforms.
- **Tag filtering** — clicking a tag toggles it in the active filter set. Filtering applies to the 7-day agenda, overdue section, upcoming deadlines, and someday section. Multiple selected tags use AND semantics: an item must contain every selected tag to remain visible.
- **Tag color mode** — explicit toolbar toggle that repurposes tag clicks from filtering to recoloring. `Alt`-click on a tag opens its color picker directly without changing mode.
- **Tag picker keyboard support** — in the add/edit panel, `ArrowUp`/`ArrowDown` move through tag suggestions, `Enter` selects the highlighted suggestion, and `Backspace` on an empty tag field removes the last selected pill.
- **Priority badges** — `[#A]`/`[#B]`/`[#C]` rendered as small colored badges (red/amber/blue) nested inside the item title so the row grid templates stay fixed. Do not duplicate priority in metadata rows; it should appear before the title everywhere.
- **Progress badges** — `[2/3]` rendered as a small badge next to the title (green when complete, gray otherwise)
- **Checkbox lists** — `- [ ]`/`- [X]` items rendered as a mini checklist under the agenda item; checked items dimmed. The checklist editor is available for TODO tasks, including repeating tasks, and hidden for events. Events never write checklist state. Lists are collapsed by default; a small disclosure control inside the item title (`>` collapsed, `<` expanded) toggles visibility per list. Collapse state is keyed by a stable per-list identity so it survives full agenda rerenders, and duplicate renderings of the same entry (e.g. an upcoming-deadlines row and the matching day-card row) keep independent state.
- **Recurrence-exception chip** — shifted or rescheduled occurrences show a small muted chip nested before the title: `← Moved` / `→ Moved` (arrow direction reflects whether the occurrence moved earlier or later than the base slot). Skipped occurrences are de-emphasised instead of badged: a `•` glyph prefixes the title, the row drops to opacity 0.55, and the title shifts to muted text; the word "Skipped" lives only in the tooltip / aria-label. Tooltip carries the detail (`+45m`, `from 2026-05-11 17:00-18:00`, `Skipped occurrence`).
- **Instance note** — `:EXCEPTION-NOTE-<date>:` renders as an italic one-liner directly under the occurrence, aligned with the row's title column.
- **Now line** on today's card — orange line positioned proportionally within the timed section
- **Navigation** — prev/next by 7-day increments, "Today" button returns to today as start date
- **Notifications** — toolbar toggle requests browser notification permission and persists `mediant-notifications`. When enabled, the client schedules notifications for timed events that occur today, 1 hour before their start time; timers are cleared and rebuilt on render.
- **Keyboard shortcuts** — `n` next week, `p` previous week, `t` jump to today, `a` open add-item panel, `q` open quick capture, `c` toggle tag color mode, `h` toggle hide empty days, `d` toggle hide completed & skipped, `x` clear active tag filters. Disabled while focus is inside text inputs, textareas, selects, or other editable controls.
- **Someday section** at the bottom — undated TODO items (no timestamps, no SCHEDULED/DEADLINE), shown in source order so quick captures stay in capture order
- **Quick capture** — fixed one-line overlay opened with `q`. Placeholder text is `Quick task capture`; `Enter` appends the text as an undated `TODO` child under top-level `* Tasks`, clears the field, and keeps focus ready for repeated capture. `Escape` or clicking outside the input exits. Captured Org-looking text is sanitized so priority cookies, trailing tags, progress cookies, and timestamps remain plain title text instead of changing agenda classification.
- **Add-item panel** — slide-in panel for creating TODO tasks and events. Defaults to Event because quick capture covers low-friction TODO entry. New TODOs append under top-level `* Tasks`; new events append under top-level `* Events`. Generates Org text and appends to the active source (server file or localStorage).
- **Edit-item panel** — same slide-in panel, opened from a per-item edit button. TODO/event type is locked after creation; the type selector is hidden in edit mode and the panel heading reads `Edit task` or `Edit event` accordingly. Rewrites the existing Org block in place, preserving body lines, and autosaves valid field changes immediately rather than requiring a Save button. Shows interactive checkbox toggles for TODO entries. When the clicked item is an occurrence of a repeating series, a **"This occurrence"** block appears alongside the **"Series"** fields, exposing skip/stop-repeat toggles, a move date/time field, a note field, and Clear override; these write `:EXCEPTION-<base>:` / `:EXCEPTION-NOTE-<base>:` via `upsertProperty` and `removeProperty` immediately. The base date passed through from the click (`data-base-date` on the clicked title) is always the **unshifted** slot, so writes stay stable even after a reschedule moves the occurrence to a different day.
- **Shorthand date input** — add/edit date fields accept `DD`, `DD/MM`, `DD/MM/YY`, `DD/MM/YYYY`, `+N`, and weekday names `mon`..`sun`. Ambiguous numeric forms resolve to the next future occurrence, and 2-digit years are interpreted in the current century.
- **Org source persistence** — in static mode, the textarea content is saved to `localStorage` (`mediant-org-source`). In server mode, the source is the file passed to `mediant <file.org>` and localStorage is not used for it. All writes flow through `persistSource()` in `main.ts`, which dispatches to the active backend.

## Testing

Tests across ten suites:

- `src/org/__tests__/timestamp.test.ts` — parsing, helpers, recurrence expansion edge cases (month boundaries, leap years), per-occurrence exception application (cancelled / shift / reschedule, including midnight rollover in both directions)
- `src/org/__tests__/parser.test.ts` — headings, states, tags, planning, timestamps, body text, drawers, checkbox items, progress cookies, `parseOverride` grammar, exception-key scanning inside PROPERTIES drawers, full integration
- `src/org/__tests__/drawer.test.ts` — `upsertProperty` / `removeProperty` round-trips (create drawer in correct position, append/update/remove keys, drop empty drawer, idempotent writes)
- `src/org/__tests__/sourceEdit.test.ts` — raw Org source rewrites for edit-panel saves, TODO/DONE toggles including repeater advancement, checkbox toggles, and progress-cookie updates
- `src/agenda/__tests__/generate.test.ts` — classification, recurrence, sorting, 7-day structure, exception threading onto `AgendaItem`, full integration
- `src/ui/__tests__/render.test.ts` — DOM structure, global sections, badges, tags, checklist collapse behavior, recurrence chips/notes, tag filtering state, and toolbar controls
- `src/ui/__tests__/notifications.test.ts` — notification preference, permission handling, and scheduling behavior
- `src/__tests__/main.test.ts` — browser-level integration for static mode, TODO toggles, series editing, occurrence exceptions, and persistence
- `server/cli.test.ts` — CLI/server behavior for static serving, source API versioning, SSE behavior, and daemon plumbing
- `elisp/mediant-org-agenda-test.el` — ERT coverage for the optional Org agenda integration using real temporary Org agenda generation

Always run tests after changes to parser, timestamp, drawer, source-edit, agenda, rendering, notification, main integration, server logic, or the optional Elisp integration.

## Conventions

- 7-day range runs **startDate 00:00 through startDate+6 23:59:59** (local time)
- Source line numbers are **1-based**
- Body text is a **single string** with lines joined by `\n`, leading whitespace trimmed
- Planning lines only accepted **immediately after a heading** (or another planning line)
- Timestamp-only body lines are captured as timestamps; mixed prose+timestamp lines are body text
- Checkbox list items (`- [ ]`/`- [X]`) are captured into `checkboxItems`, not body text
- `#+` keyword lines and `# ` comment lines inside entries are **skipped, not preserved as body**
- Any `:UPPERCASENAME:...:END:` block is skipped **except** `:PROPERTIES:` drawers, where `:EXCEPTION-<date>:`, `:EXCEPTION-NOTE-<date>:`, and `:SERIES-UNTIL:` keys are read; every other property key is still ignored
- Source rewrites are line-number based and operate on raw Org text. Keep reusable rewrite behavior in `src/org/sourceEdit.ts` or `src/org/drawer.ts` so it can be tested without DOM setup.

## Non-goals (v1)

- Full Org-mode syntax
- Heading hierarchy in the agenda
- Arbitrary property drawers beyond `:EXCEPTION-…:` / `:EXCEPTION-NOTE-…:` / `:SERIES-UNTIL:`; habits, clocking, `:STYLE:`, `:CATEGORY:`, effort estimates
- "This and future" split operations (tracked in TODO.md)
- Timezone handling
- Advanced state workflows / custom TODO sequences
- Multi-file agenda
- Export to other formats
