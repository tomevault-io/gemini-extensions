# AnyDoor

A macOS menu-bar toolbox. At its core it toggles (show/hide) a target application via a global hotkey, and builds a set of system-level quick actions on top of that: clipboard history, hosts management, external display brightness, Hyper Key, window layout, command palette, and more.

## Tech Stack

- Swift 6.2, strict concurrency mode (`.swiftLanguageMode(.v6)`)
- macOS 14+
- Liquid Glass on macOS 26+; earlier supported systems fall back to a plain material background.
- SwiftUI `Settings` scene + AppKit `MenuBarController` (the menu-bar item is managed directly by `NSStatusItem`, **not** `MenuBarExtra` — see below)
- SwiftData persistence
- CGEvent tap for global hotkey monitoring
- Privileged XPC helper (`AnyDoorHostsHelper`) writes `/etc/hosts` (with an AppleScript fallback when the helper isn't enabled — see Architecture Notes)
- Sparkle for auto-updates; MonitorControl's MIT `IntelDDC` (vendored under `Services/Brightness/Vendor/`) for Intel external-display brightness; AskForPermission for permission onboarding. Bundled third-party license texts live in `THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES.md`.
- SPM build, with an in-repo build-tool plugin that compiles the `.xcstrings` string catalog

## Build and Run

```bash
# Build
swift build

# Run (dev mode; the process has no Bundle ID identity)
swift run AnyDoor

# Release build
swift build -c release

# Install as /Applications/AnyDoor.app (writes Info.plist, Bundle ID = dev.bybee.AnyDoor)
make install

# Uninstall
make uninstall

# Hot-reload development (requires watchexec)
make
```

Running requires the macOS Accessibility permission (System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility).

The `.app` from `swift run` and the one from `make install` are **two distinct process identities** and must each be granted Accessibility separately. Use `make install` for production; use `swift run` for daily development. The SwiftData store path is pinned so both paths share the same data (see below).

Release tooling lives in the `Makefile`: `make sparkle-tools` (downloads the Sparkle CLI, pinned to 2.9.2), `make release <version>` / `make release-dryrun <version>` (drive `scripts/release.sh`, sourcing `.env`), and `make notary-profile` / `make notary-check` (notarization via `xcrun notarytool`, requires `APPLE_ID` / `APPLE_TEAM_ID` / `NOTARY_PROFILE` in `.env`). Release notes go under `## [Unreleased]` in `CHANGELOG.md` (do not hand-author a `## [x.y.z]` heading); `scripts/release.sh` rewrites that heading to `## [<version>] - <today>` on release. Its preflight (step 1) asserts: `[Unreleased]` is non-empty, `Info.plist` `SUPublicEDKey` is not a placeholder (run `scripts/sparkle-bin/generate_keys` first), a codesigning cert matching `SIGNING_IDENTITY` is in the login keychain, `sign_update` / `generate_appcast` are installed (`make sparkle-tools`), the `notarytool` keychain profile is configured, and `gh` is logged in.

## Project Structure

The codebase is large; the layout below is organized by subsystem (not a file-by-file listing). SPM targets: `AnyDoor` (main app), `HostsHelperShared` (shared XPC-contract library), `XPCAuditToken` (ObjC shim exposing the XPC peer audit token), `AnyDoorHostsHelper` (privileged helper executable), `AnyDoorTests`, and `XCStringsCompilerPlugin` (a `.buildTool()` plugin at `Plugins/XCStringsCompiler`, attached to `AnyDoor`, that compiles `.xcstrings` string catalogs via `xcrun xcstringstool` at build time — this is why localization works under plain `swift build` without Xcode).

## Architecture Notes

- **Shared ModelContainer**: created in `AppDelegate.init()` and handed to all SwiftUI views via `.modelContainer()`. Do not create multiple ModelContainer instances.
- **Pinned store path**: ModelContainer is explicitly configured with `url: ~/Library/Application Support/dev.bybee.AnyDoor/AnyDoor.store` so `swift run` and the `.app` don't write to different locations due to Bundle ID differences. The schema registers exactly four `@Model` types — `KeyBinding`, `BuiltinPreference`, `ClipboardHistoryItem`, `HostProfile`. On launch `AppDelegate` performs a one-time migration from the legacy `default.store` and cleans it up (see `migrateLegacyStore`). **Keep this path when changing the ModelConfiguration**, otherwise user data appears "lost".
- **Launch-time SwiftData seeding/migration**: besides `migrateLegacyStore`, `AppDelegate.applicationDidFinishLaunching` runs idempotent `BuiltinPreferenceSeeder` (one `BuiltinPreference` row per `BuiltinItem`, appends newly added builtins at max order+1, uses versioned backfill flags) and `KeyBindingOrderBackfill` (assigns stride-100 `displayOrder` to legacy zero-order rows). New `@Model` fields **must carry inline defaults** so SwiftData lightweight migration can backfill existing rows (see `KeyBinding.isEnabled/isVisible/displayOrder`).
- **CGEvent callback concurrency safety**: the callback is a C-style free function, not on `@MainActor`. Data is passed safely via `HotkeySnapshot` (a Sendable value type carrying `HotkeyAction`) plus `nonisolated(unsafe)` storage.
- **CGEvent tap timeout & watchdog**: the system budgets the tap callback at ~1 second; exceeding it triggers `.tapDisabledByTimeout` and auto-disables the tap. Current defenses:
  - the callback only matches keys; real work is dispatched via `DispatchQueue.main.async`
  - on `tapDisabledBy*` the tap is re-enabled inline inside the callback
  - a 2-second watchdog checks `CGEvent.tapIsEnabled` and calls `restart()` (tears down and rebuilds the tap) if needed
  - **never do synchronous expensive work inside the callback** (I/O, SwiftData fetch, modal dialogs, etc.)
- **HotkeyService health & keyboard lock**: `HotkeyService` exposes `tapHealth` (`healthy` / `suspendedByRecorder` / `transientlyDown` / `failed`) so the UI can surface accessibility-revoked or tap-create failures; a hard failure is only reported after ≥2 consecutive restart attempts fail. `setKeyboardLocked(_:)` powers a keyboard-lock feature — while locked the callback swallows all unmatched key events, but registered hotkeys still fire so the same shortcut can unlock.
- **Modifier alignment**: both recording and detection use `CGEventFlags` bitmasks (`maskCommand | maskControl | maskAlternate | maskShift`); do not use `NSEvent.ModifierFlags`.
- **Suppress dispatch while recording**: when recording a hotkey, the recorder calls `HotkeyService.beginRecording(observer:)` / `endRecording()`. The tap stays **active** (so the Caps-Lock/F19 Hyper trigger is still observed) but bound-hotkey dispatch and Quick Press are suppressed while `recordingObserver` is set, so recording can't fire an existing binding. `suspend()` / `resume()` (which fully disable the tap, and which the watchdog honors via `isSuspended`) exist but are **not** used by the recorder.
- **Data-change notification**: binding add/remove flows through `PanelStore.addAppShortcut` / `deleteAppShortcut`, which internally `save()` SwiftData, `rebuild()` view state, and `rebuildHotkeySnapshots()` to refresh HotkeyService — views do not call `modelContext.save()` directly. (`AppDelegate.refreshBindings()` still exists as a hot-reload helper but currently has no callers.)
- **Toggle semantics**: `AppSwitcher.toggle` uses `app.isActive` (frontmost check) rather than `app.isHidden`. If the target is already frontmost it calls `app.hide()`; otherwise (not frontmost, or not running) it routes through `NSWorkspace.openApplication(at:)` (`activate(at:)`) — deliberately **not** `NSRunningApplication.activate()`, which macOS 14+ silently ignores when an `.accessory` app tries to activate while another regular app holds focus. Changing the condition changes the interaction semantics.
- **PanelStore is the single source of truth**: three data sources (the static `BuiltinItem` catalog + `BuiltinPreference` preferences + `KeyBinding` app shortcuts) are merged in `PanelStore.rebuild()`; views read `topLevelEntries`, `appShortcutChildren`, and `windowLayoutChildren` (window-layout child rows are partitioned out separately). **All writes must go through PanelStore's mutation methods** (`setBuiltinVisibility`, `setBuiltinHotkey`, `updateAppShortcut`, `reorderTopLevel`, `reorderAppShortcuts`, `reorderWindowChildren`, `addAppShortcut`, `deleteAppShortcut`), which save SwiftData, `rebuild()` view state, and call `rebuildHotkeySnapshots()` to push to HotkeyService — except `reorderAppShortcuts`, which only changes display order and intentionally skips the snapshot rebuild. `rebuildHotkeySnapshots()` also draws from a **fourth** hotkey source: the Command Palette hotkey (`CommandPaletteService.shared.hotkey`). PanelStore additionally owns the provider registry and the activation paths (`dispatch`, `toggle`, `run`, `setKeepAwakeDuration`) with per-item in-flight guards.
- **HotkeyAction dispatch**: HotkeyService's callback uses an injected `dispatcher` closure, bound in `AppDelegate.applicationDidFinishLaunching` to `PanelStore.shared.dispatch`. Do not reference PanelStore directly inside HotkeyService — keep HotkeyService decoupled from business logic.
- **Provider isolation**: most ToggleProvider / ActionProvider implementations are their own `actor` and `setState` / `run` runs serially on that actor; the UI/window-coupled ones (`ClipboardWallProvider`, `WindowLayoutProvider`) are `@MainActor final class` instead. There are 23 concrete provider types (`BuiltinProvider.swift` holds only the `ToggleProvider` / `ActionProvider` protocols). `PanelStore` is `@MainActor`, and cross-provider writes are scheduled on the MainActor via `Task { await … }`.
- **The menu bar is not MenuBarExtra**: the menu-bar item is owned by the AppKit `MenuBarController` (`NSStatusItem` + a floating `NSPanel`). SwiftUI `MenuBarExtra` with `isInserted: false` infinite-loops the scene graph on macOS 26, so `AnyDoor.swift` keeps only the `Settings` scene. When AppKit needs to open Settings it goes through `SettingsOpener` (an off-screen `NSHostingView` mounted at launch captures the `\.openSettings` closure).
- **Window state restoration must stay off**: this is a menu-bar utility — no window should appear on launch. `AppDelegate.application(_:shouldRestoreApplicationState:)` / `shouldSaveApplicationState` return `false` so macOS won't reopen the previous Settings window on login auto-launch; `RegularWindowRegistrar` additionally sets the Settings window `isRestorable = false` as a fallback for the per-window restoration path. **Any new window must be verified not to be restored.**
- **Dynamic activation policy**: normally `.accessory` (no Dock icon). `RegularWindowCoordinator` switches to `.regular` while a "real" window (Settings, the Hosts editor) is open — otherwise the window slips behind and can't be resurfaced — and reverts to `.accessory` once the last one closes.
- **AppDelegate lifecycle extras**: `applicationShouldTerminate` clears the Hyper Key mapping (racing a 500 ms timeout) before quitting; `applicationShouldHandleReopen` re-opens Settings when AnyDoor is relaunched with no visible window, so a hidden menu-bar icon can be re-enabled.
- **Privileged hosts writes**: when the XPC helper is enabled, `/etc/hosts` is written by `AnyDoorHostsHelper` (a privileged LaunchDaemon installed via `SMAppService.daemon`); `HostsManager` coordinates and `PrivilegedHelperWriter` talks over XPC. When the helper is **not** enabled (ad-hoc/dev builds, or before approval), the main app falls back to `AppleScriptWriter`, which copies a temp file over `/etc/hosts` via an administrator-authorized `do shell script`. `HostsManager.makeWriter` re-resolves the writer on every write from `HelperManager.readiness()`, so helper approval takes effect without a relaunch (`MockHostsWriter` is for tests). The helper validates every caller's code signature via the peer **audit token** (the `XPCAuditToken` ObjC shim, which redeclares the private `NSXPCConnection.auditToken`) — requiring Team ID `9VM4RM39R3` + identifier `dev.bybee.AnyDoor` — to close the PID-recycle TOCTOU window. The XPC contract (`@objc PrivilegedHelperProtocol` + `PrivilegedHelperConstants`, including a 1 MiB payload cap and a fixed-verb `shutDown` method used by Scheduled Shutdown) lives in the shared `HostsHelperShared` target, imported by both the app and the helper.
- **Brightness backend selected by architecture**: `DisplayBrightnessService` drives a `BrightnessController` (an `actor` that serializes DDC VCP 0x10 I/O and retries a failed write once); the `DDCBackend` is injected into that controller in `AppDelegate`, where `#if arch(arm64)` chooses `Arm64DDCBackend` else `IntelDDCBackend`. Brightness up/down are hidden hotkeys (`HotkeyAction.brightnessUp/Down`).
- **Hyper Key: two-phase + watchdog**: the trigger is remapped to virtual key **F19** (keyCode 80) via `hidutil` `UserKeyMapping`; HotkeyService then re-emits the Hyper modifier flags (Ctrl+Opt+Cmd, plus Shift when `includeShift` is on). Phase 1 — at launch `AppDelegate` unconditionally calls `HyperKeyController.reconcile()`, which **clears** any leftover owned mapping (crash recovery; the controller records the hidutil entries it owns in the `hyperKey.ownedSignatures` UserDefaults key so it never nukes third-party mappings). Phase 2 — `HyperKeyService.bootstrapAfterTap` runs once the tap is ready, re-applies the active trigger, uses a `mutationToken` to stop stale async work from overwriting newer state, and runs a 2-second watchdog following `HotkeyService.tapHealth`. The trigger/quickPress/includeShift config lives in **UserDefaults** (not SwiftData). Tapping the trigger alone fires a **Quick Press** action (none / Escape / original key) via `QuickPressEmitter`, whose synthesized CGEvents carry `kAnyDoorSynthesizedEventTag` on `eventSourceUserData` so the tap passes through its own emissions (the Caps-Lock "original" case toggles via IOKit `IOHIDSetModifierLockState`). The mapping is cleared on system power-off (`willPowerOffNotification`) and on termination (gated on `hasPersistedSignatures`).
- **Config sync / backup**: backup (Settings → General) serializes app shortcuts (`KeyBinding`), builtin preferences (`BuiltinPreference`), and whitelisted general settings (`SyncSettingsRegistry`) into a schema-versioned Codable `BackupSnapshot`. Clipboard history and machine-specific keys are excluded, `appPath` is never serialized (re-resolved from bundle ID on import), import merges per key (imported wins, local-only rows kept), and `reconcileAfterImport` re-reads settings into CommandPaletteService / LocalizationManager / HyperKeyService / ScheduledShutdownService and rebuilds hotkey snapshots so changes apply without relaunch. Storage sits behind a `SyncBackend` protocol (current backend: `LocalFileBackend`).
- **Scheduled Shutdown**: `ScheduledShutdownService` (`@MainActor`, like HyperKey/CommandPalette) owns a one-shot schedule — it persists the absolute target `Date` (`scheduledShutdown.fireDate`), re-arms on launch (cancelling a deadline missed while quit), re-validates on `NSWorkspace.didWakeNotification`, and shows a cancelable floating-`NSPanel` warning (`ShutdownWarningWindowController`) before firing. A thin `ScheduledShutdownProvider` (`ToggleProvider`) plugs into the panel/hotkey path; `PanelStore` mirrors its Keep Awake plumbing (`scheduledShutdownState`, `setScheduledShutdownDuration`, `onScheduledShutdownStateChange`). Execution goes through `ShutdownExecuting`: graceful via `AppleScriptRunner` (System Events, Automation permission), forced via the privileged helper. Config (`forced`/`warningLeadSeconds`/`defaultMinutes`) is portable via `SyncSettingsRegistry`; the live `fireDate` is machine-local.
- **Command palette second-level menu**: option-bearing commands drill into a second level instead of acting with a default. `CommandPaletteOptions` (`@MainActor`) is the single source of truth for which builtins are option parents (`keepAwake` / `scheduledShutdown` / `brightness` / `hostsManager` / `portManager`) and their options; pure per-item builders take fetched state (`isOn` / `isArmed` / `displays` / `profiles` / port `records`) so they unit-test without singletons. `CommandPaletteState` holds a `.root` ⇄ `.options` stack; option rows reuse `PanelEntry` via `Source.paletteOption(id:)` (only a `String`, the action looked up by id on the MainActor), and the second-level search matches title **and** subtitle (so a port number filters the port list). `CommandPaletteWindowController` lists Brightness (only with an external DDC display), Hosts, and Port Manager, drills in on commit (entering even an empty options array so it shows the empty state rather than closing), runs an option then closes. `Esc` runs `CommandPaletteState.handleEscape()` (a testable policy returning `.clearedQuery` / `.poppedToRoot` / `.dismiss`): a non-empty query clears first at either level, then an empty query pops to root from the second level or dismisses at the root (empty-query `Backspace` also pops). Port Manager drilling refreshes `PortInventory` and kills the selected port's process. A second, faster path coexists: typing a port number at the root surfaces a "Ports" section (`CommandPaletteState.portSection` over `PortInventory.records`, rows carrying `PanelEntry.Source.portRecord`) whose rows kill on commit — so ports are reachable both by drilling into Port Manager and by direct numeric search. Both kill paths are guarded by a Raycast-style in-palette confirmation card: commit routes through `CommandPaletteState.requestConfirmation` (a `pendingConfirmation` slot holding a `CommandPaletteConfirmation` descriptor + a `@MainActor` perform closure) instead of killing; `CommandPaletteOption.confirmation` marks options that need it (set by `portOptions` via `portKillConfirmation(for:)`), and the controller builds the same descriptor for `.portRecord` rows. While `isConfirming`, the key monitor maps Return→`confirmPending()`, Esc→`cancelConfirmation()`, and swallows other keys; `CommandPalettePicker` overlays the card.
- **Localization**: UI strings go through `LocalizationManager.shared` (system / Simplified Chinese / English), injected via `.environment`. New user-facing strings use `L10n` / `LocalizedText`; do not hardcode them. The `.xcstrings` catalog is compiled at build time by the `XCStringsCompilerPlugin` build-tool plugin.
