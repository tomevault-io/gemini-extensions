# Research note: The official Windsurf rules filename was verified against
# community documentation and the Codeium blog — `.windsurfrules` is the
# established convention for the repository root and continues to be supported.
# Newer Windsurf versions also introduced a directory-based system at
# `.windsurf/rules/` where rules are defined as named markdown files with
# activation modes (always on, manual, glob, model decision). Verify the
# current recommendation in the official documentation at https://docs.windsurf.com/
# before deploying, as Windsurf's tooling evolves frequently.

# Agent Context — [Your Project Name]

## Project Purpose

<!--
  2-3 sentences describing what this project does, who it's for, and what
  problem it solves. Helps Cascade understand the domain and make
  appropriate design decisions.

  Example:
  "A REST API for inventory management used by warehouse operations teams.
  Built with Go and PostgreSQL. Handles ~10K requests/minute in production."
-->

[Describe your project here]

---

## Architecture

<!--
  Describe the high-level structure: major components, how they interact,
  key technology choices, and what patterns the codebase follows.

  Example:
  "Monorepo with packages/ for libraries and apps/ for services.
  All services communicate via gRPC with protobuf schemas in proto/.
  Shared utilities live in packages/common."
-->

- **Primary language:** [e.g., TypeScript, Python, Go, Rust]
- **Framework/runtime:** [e.g., Next.js 14, FastAPI, Go stdlib]
- **Key dependencies:** [e.g., Prisma + PostgreSQL, Redis for caching]
- **Project structure:**

```
project-root/
├── src/              # Application source code
├── tests/            # Test files
├── docs/             # Documentation
└── ...
```

---

## Coding Conventions

<!--
  Rules Cascade should follow when generating or modifying code.
  Be explicit — the AI has no way to infer unwritten conventions.
-->

- **Formatting:** [e.g., Prettier with default config; Black + isort for Python]
- **Naming:** [e.g., camelCase for variables, PascalCase for classes, SCREAMING_SNAKE for constants]
- **Imports:** [e.g., absolute imports only; group as stdlib / third-party / local with blank lines between]
- **Types:** [e.g., strict TypeScript — no implicit `any`; type hints required on all public functions]
- **Comments:** [e.g., explain why, not what; JSDoc on all public APIs]

---

## Error Handling

<!--
  How errors should be surfaced, logged, and propagated.
-->

- [e.g., "Use typed error classes — never throw raw strings"]
- [e.g., "All async functions must have explicit try/catch or propagate via Result<T, E>"]
- [e.g., "Log errors at the point of origin; do not re-log at callers"]
- [e.g., "User-facing error messages must not expose internal stack traces"]

---

## Testing

<!--
  Test framework, file location conventions, naming conventions,
  and coverage expectations.
-->

- **Framework:** [e.g., Jest + Testing Library; pytest; Go testing]
- **Location:** [e.g., `__tests__/` next to source; `tests/` at root]
- **Naming:** [e.g., `*.test.ts`; `test_<module>.py`; `*_test.go`]
- **Coverage expectations:** [e.g., all public functions must have tests; 80% line coverage minimum]
- **Test data:** [e.g., fixtures in `tests/fixtures/`; factories in `tests/factories/`]

---

## Development Workflow

<!--
  Branch strategy, commit message format, PR requirements,
  and anything Cascade should know when helping with git or CI tasks.
-->

- **Branches:** [e.g., `feature/<ticket>-<slug>`, `fix/<ticket>-<slug>`]
- **Commits:** [e.g., Conventional Commits — `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`]
- **PRs:** [e.g., must link to issue; must pass CI; require one reviewer]
- **CI:** [e.g., GitHub Actions — lint, test, build on every push]
- **Local setup:** [e.g., `make dev` starts the dev server; `make test` runs the full suite]

---

## Parallelization Rules

<!--
  How work should be divided when multiple agents or tasks run concurrently.
  Prevents conflicts when AI agents work in parallel across the codebase.
-->

- [e.g., "Each agent works in its own git worktree — never share a working directory"]
- [e.g., "Database migrations are sequential — only one agent may write migrations at a time"]
- [e.g., "Shared config files (package.json, pyproject.toml) require coordination — flag conflicts"]
- [e.g., "Generated files (OpenAPI, protobuf) are regenerated from source — do not edit directly"]

---

## What Not to Do

<!--
  Explicit anti-patterns. Cascade will follow these as hard rules.
-->

- [e.g., "Do not use `any` type in TypeScript — use `unknown` and narrow explicitly"]
- [e.g., "Do not commit secrets, API keys, or credentials — use environment variables"]
- [e.g., "Do not add dependencies without documenting the reason in the PR"]
- [e.g., "Do not bypass the repository layer — never call the database directly from handlers"]
- [e.g., "Do not leave TODO comments in production code — open an issue instead"]
