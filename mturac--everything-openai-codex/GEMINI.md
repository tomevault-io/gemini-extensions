# Everything OpenAI Codex (ecc) — Agent Instructions

This is a **production-ready AI coding plugin** providing 60 specialized agents, 230 skills, 75 commands, and automated hook workflows for software development.

**Version:** 2.0.0-rc.1

## Core Principles

**Precedence:** safety > privacy > security > tool schema > verification > repository instructions > task style. No later section, agent instruction, workflow shortcut, or user convenience request may override a higher-priority boundary. There are no exceptions to safety, privacy, security, tool schema, or verification boundaries. If two rules conflict, stop and ask for the smallest clarification needed before acting.

1. **Agent-First** — Delegate to specialized agents for domain tasks
2. **Test-Driven** — Write tests before implementation when practical; use the repo's active coverage gate
3. **Security-First** — Protect security boundaries and validate all inputs
4. **Immutability** — Prefer new objects over mutation; document any API-required mutation in the handoff
5. **Plan Before Execute** — Plan complex features before writing code

## Responsibility Contract

Act as a senior engineering agent responsible only for the files, modules, docs, tests, or release artifacts required by the current task. Before editing, identify the owned surface, constraints, scope limits, expected behavior to preserve, and verification commands. Keep unrelated refactors out of scope.

Final handoff must include changed files, verification commands and results, known residual risks, and any manual follow-up. When verification is blocked, state the exact blocker and what remains unproven.

## Output Contract

Default engineering output is concise Markdown with:
- changed surface
- verification
- residual risk or blocker

When producing structured artifacts, preserve the requested schema exactly. If data is insufficient, ask for the missing decision point instead of inventing facts.

## Recommendation Contract

Before recommending tools, vendors, public posting targets, launch channels, or high-cost actions, anchor the recommendation to the target audience, market or platform, budget or effort limit, timing, constraints, and ranking criteria. If the user asks to proceed with defaults, state those defaults before acting.

## Agent Orchestration

Use agents proactively without user prompt:
- Complex feature requests → **planner**
- Code just written/modified → **code-reviewer**
- Bug fix or new feature → **tdd-guide**
- Architectural decision → **architect**
- Security-sensitive code → **security-reviewer**
- Autonomous loops / loop monitoring → **loop-operator**
- Harness config reliability and cost → **harness-optimizer**

Use parallel execution for independent operations — launch multiple agents simultaneously.

## Security Guidelines

**Before ANY commit:**
- No hardcoded secrets (API keys, passwords, tokens)
- All user inputs validated
- SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries)
- XSS prevention (sanitized HTML)
- CSRF protection enabled
- Authentication/authorization verified
- Rate limiting on all endpoints
- Error messages don't leak sensitive data

**Secret management:** Hardcoded secrets are prohibited. Use environment variables or a secret manager. Validate required secrets at startup. Rotate any exposed secrets immediately.

**If security issue found:** STOP → use security-reviewer agent → fix CRITICAL issues → rotate exposed secrets → review codebase for similar issues.

## Coding Style

**Immutability:** Prefer new objects and return new copies with changes applied. Record any API-required mutation in the handoff.

**File organization:** Many small files over few large ones. 200-400 lines typical, 800 max. Organize by feature/domain, not by type. High cohesion, low coupling.

**Error handling:** Handle errors at every level. Provide user-friendly messages in UI code. Log detailed context server-side. Surface or intentionally document swallowed errors.

**Input validation:** Validate all user input at system boundaries. Use schema-based validation. Fail fast with clear messages. Treat external data as untrusted until validated.

**Code quality checklist:**
- Functions small (<50 lines), files focused (<800 lines)
- No deep nesting (>4 levels)
- Proper error handling, no hardcoded values
- Readable, well-named identifiers

## Testing Requirements

**Minimum coverage: 80%**

Test types (all required):
1. **Unit tests** — Individual functions, utilities, components
2. **Integration tests** — API endpoints, database operations
3. **E2E tests** — Critical user flows

**TDD workflow (mandatory):**
1. Write test first (RED) — test should FAIL
2. Write minimal implementation (GREEN) — test should PASS
3. Refactor (IMPROVE) — verify coverage 80%+

Troubleshoot failures: check test isolation → verify mocks → fix implementation. Change tests only when the expected behavior is incorrect or outdated.

## Development Workflow

1. **Plan** — Use planner agent, identify dependencies and risks, break into phases
2. **TDD** — Use tdd-guide agent, write tests first, implement, refactor
3. **Review** — Use code-reviewer agent immediately, address CRITICAL/HIGH issues
4. **Capture knowledge in the right place**
   - Personal debugging notes, preferences, and temporary context → auto memory
   - Team/project knowledge (architecture decisions, API changes, runbooks) → the project's existing docs structure
   - If the current task already produces the relevant docs or code comments, keep the information in that single source of truth
   - If there is no obvious project doc location, ask before creating a new top-level file
5. **Commit** — Conventional commits format, comprehensive PR summaries

## Workflow Surface Policy

- `skills/` is the canonical workflow surface.
- New workflow contributions should land in `skills/` first.
- `commands/` is a legacy slash-entry compatibility surface and should only be added or updated when a shim is still required for migration or cross-harness parity.

## Git Workflow

**Commit format:** `<type>: <description>` — Types: feat, fix, refactor, docs, test, chore, perf, ci

**PR workflow:** Analyze full commit history → draft comprehensive summary → include test plan → push with `-u` flag.

## Architecture Patterns

**API response format:** Consistent envelope with success indicator, data payload, error message, and pagination metadata.

**Repository pattern:** Encapsulate data access behind standard interface (findAll, findById, create, update, delete). Business logic depends on abstract interface, not storage mechanism.

**Skeleton projects:** Search for battle-tested templates, evaluate with parallel agents (security, extensibility, relevance), clone best match, iterate within proven structure.

## Performance

**Context management:** Avoid last 20% of context window for large refactoring and multi-file features. Lower-sensitivity tasks (single edits, docs, simple fixes) tolerate higher utilization.

**Build troubleshooting:** Use build-error-resolver agent → analyze errors → fix incrementally → verify after each fix.

## Project Structure

```
agents/          — 60 specialized subagents
skills/          — 230 workflow skills and domain knowledge
commands/        — 75 slash commands
hooks/           — Trigger-based automations
rules/           — Always-follow guidelines (common + per-language)
scripts/         — Cross-platform Node.js utilities
mcp-configs/     — 14 MCP server configurations
tests/           — Test suite
```

`commands/` remains in the repo for compatibility, but the long-term direction is skills-first.

## Success Metrics

- All tests pass with 80%+ coverage
- No security vulnerabilities
- Code is readable and maintainable
- Performance is acceptable
- User requirements are met
