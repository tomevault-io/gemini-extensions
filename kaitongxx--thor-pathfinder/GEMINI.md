# Thor Pathfinder — project notes

Open-source (GPL-3.0) Android app for the AYN Thor that replaces Thor Wayfinder:
swaps apps between the two screens and puts shortcuts on the Thor's buttons.
Kotlin + Jetpack Compose, package `com.thorpathfinder.app`, minSdk 33
(the Thor ships Android 13). README.md is the user-facing description.

Machine-specific notes (toolchain paths, the test Thor's serial, git
identity) live in `CLAUDE.local.md`, which is gitignored.

## Status (2026-09-18)

- v0.4.0 (versionCode 9), released 2026-09-18: adds the Screen record action
  (labelled "(Testing)"), the AYN button's own menu when a gesture is left on
  Normal, Check For Updates, and controller scrolling that reaches the true
  top and bottom of a page. 0.3.0 added Close all apps; 0.2.0 was the first
  public release.
  Release APK is about 1.7 MB (R8 on). Bump `versionCode` for every APK
  handed over.
- **Tested on an AYN Thor (firmware 1.0.0.377):** the setup wizard, hold
  Back to swap (two apps; a lone app in both directions), double Back for
  recents, double Select for mouse mode, the focus fix, the YouTube/Discord
  sequence (a lone app's vacated screen goes home, with no flash), Close all
  apps (Recents left empty, apps stopped, screens home, service alive), the
  overlay messages, Screen record from a tile on either Quick Settings page,
  the AYN button with a double-press shortcut (press opens AYN's menu, long
  press its panel), Check For Updates and its release-page link, and
  controller scrolling to both ends of the settings and the shortcut picker.
- **Not yet verified on hardware:** "Open an app", shortcuts on Home in daily
  use, the covered-app fix-up (`moveTaskToFront`), the
  media-first swap order with a real video (logic unit-tested), and the
  "Restricted setting" flow for sideloaded installs (adb installs skip it).
- **Signing.** Releases are signed with the project key (certificate SHA-256
  `2706e85ba69b3f77e37227b4c0a0f99311fc73434d7264216f7bf32cbe439897`,
  CN=Thor Pathfinder). Gradle reads it from `keystore.properties` in the
  project root (gitignored) or from `PATHFINDER_KEYSTORE*` environment
  variables; debug builds use it too, so either installs over the other.
  Without it, both fall back to the local debug key. Never commit, print or
  share the key or its password.
- **Releasing.** Bump `versionCode`/`versionName`, run the tests, build
  `assembleRelease`, copy the APK to `release/Thor-Pathfinder-X.Y.Z.apk`
  (gitignored), check it with `apksigner verify --print-certs`, commit and
  push, then `gh release create vX.Y.Z <apk>` with notes that list the APK's
  SHA-256 and the certificate fingerprint.
- **Clean-room.** Written from scratch. Never copy Thor Wayfinder's code, text
  or branding: it is CC BY-NC-ND, and its README forbids copying, modifying or
  derivatives without written permission. Facts about AYN's firmware are fine.
- **Licenses.** Anything bundled into the APK needs its license in
  `app/src/main/assets/licenses` (shown under About → Open-source licenses)
  and in THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md. Shizuku's app terms forbid using the name
  "Shizuku" for an app, its package ID or icon, or declaring its
  `moe.shizuku.manager.permission.*` permissions (using them, as the API
  library does, is how clients work).

## Facts learned on the Thor (firmware 1.0.0.377)

- **Buttons.** Controller is "Odin Controller" (`/dev/input/event9`):
  KEY_BACK 158 -> BACK, KEY_HOME 102 -> HOME, plus Select, Start, L3 and R3.
  The AYN button is KEY_F24 (194) on `gpio-keys`, mapped to HOME WAKE. Keys
  Android injects (global actions, `input`, on-screen gestures) have scan code
  0, so system buttons are matched on scan code too. No back paddles; C, Z,
  MODE and APP_SWITCH are in the key layout but not on the device. In AYN's
  mouse mode, B sends BACK through a virtual keyboard.
- **Displays.** 0 = top (1920x1080 landscape), 4 = bottom (1240x1080). The
  other screen is the lowest non-default display ID.
- **`am stack list`**: `RootTask id=N ... displayId=D`, a configuration line,
  then `  taskId=T: pkg/cls ... visible=... topActivity=ComponentInfo{...}`,
  per display topmost first. `am display move-stack <root> <display>` moves a
  root task on top without relaunching it (~15 ms; `am` is a script around
  `cmd activity`). There is no shell "bring task to front": use
  `ActivityManager.moveTaskToFront` (REORDER_TASKS, a normal permission).
- **Cocoon** (a third-party launcher) closes its home activities (MainActivity on
  0, ExternalDisplayActivity on 4) while an app covers them, and relaunches
  ExternalDisplayActivity itself when display 4 changes, which can land on top
  of an app that just arrived. Hence the 300 ms `covered()` fix-up.
- **A lone app's move** presses Home on the screen it left, in the same shell
  command (`input -d D keyevent KEYCODE_HOME`). Without it Android reveals the
  next thing down: Launcher3's Recents, or an app the user had sent home.
  Never press Home before the move: it covers the moving app.
- **Swap stutter.** A swap is two moves; the second app is covered for ~15 ms,
  and a video drops its surface. A media-playing app (`dumpsys media_session`,
  state 3 or 6) moves first; otherwise the top app. An atomic swap would need
  a WindowContainerTransaction.
- **Close all apps.** Recents' Clear all = `removeAllVisibleRecentTasks`;
  the shell (REMOVE_TASKS) gets the same per task with `am stack remove <id>`,
  which also works for tasks only in Recents (no longer on a screen) and ends
  the process. `dumpsys activity recents` lists `* Recent #n: Task{.. #id
  type=standard|home|recents ..}` blocks with `mActivityComponent=pkg/.Cls`
  (abbreviated), `intent={.. flg=0x.. ..}` (0x00800000 = exclude from
  Recents; Cocoon's secondary-home tasks carry it) and `inRecents=`. The
  Thor's own Clear all (its recents app, "Killing ...: stop <pkg> due to from
  pid <recents>" in logcat) removes the tasks, force-stops each package, and
  sends both screens home; it removes Pathfinder's task too, but the service
  process survives. Close all matches that: it removes Pathfinder's own task
  (Recents ends up empty) but never force-stops its own package, since the
  accessibility service runs in it. Removal alone leaves processes cached, so
  every other closed app gets `am force-stop`.
- **AYN button.** AYN's PhoneWindowManager.interceptKeyBeforeDispatching
  (when config bool 17891754 is true) consumes scan code 194 and sends the
  broadcast `action.tcc.button.key.event` with `key_action_down` and
  `key_isLongPress`: down (true, false), long press on key repeat after
  ~400 ms (true, true), up (false, false). Receivers: com.odin.dualscreen.
  assistant (press: its menu, window on display 4), System UI and system
  (long press: `primaryScreenTopLayout` on the top screen). It never acts as
  Home. The broadcast is protected (shell: "Permission Denial: not allowed
  to send broadcast"), so a Normal press is replayed as the real key:
  `sendevent` on the `gpio-keys` device (path from /proc/bus/input/devices,
  readable by shell; event1 on the test Thor) via Shizuku, 50 ms press or
  900 ms for a long press, and `GestureEngine.letThrough` passes that one
  press untouched. A long press with no hold shortcut fires HOLD/NORMAL.
- **Screen record.** System UI's recorder panel (window "Screen Recorder",
  TYPE_STATUS_BAR_SUB_PANEL, owner com.android.systemui; on this ROM it also
  picks top/bottom screen) opens only from the `screenrecord` QS tile.
  Dead ends: `RecordingService` (actions `com.android.systemui.screenrecord.
  START/STOP/SHARE/UPDATE_STATE`) is not exported, so the shell may not
  start it; `ScreenRecordDialog` is a SystemUIDialog, not an activity;
  `cmd statusbar click-tile` only reaches TileService tiles; no broadcast
  opens it; AYN's ST_OPERATION_RECORD_SCREEN uses gameassistant's own
  VideoRecordService (not exported). The shell `screenrecord` tool (v1.3)
  records display 0 only, no audio, no menu. Working route: `cmd statusbar
  expand-settings`, `uiautomator dump` (about 2 s; needs a file, /dev/tty
  has no tty under Shizuku), tiles are `tile_label` nodes inside
  `qs_pager` (8 per page in landscape), page from `footer_page_indicator`
  ("Page 1 of 2"), swipe the pager to change page, `input -d 0 tap`. QS
  keeps the last page shown. Label from System UI's string
  `quick_settings_screen_record_label` via getResourcesForApplication.
- **Check For Updates** (`UpdateCheck.kt`) is the app's only network use
  and the reason for the INTERNET permission: one GET to
  `api.github.com/repos/KaitonGxx/thor-pathfinder/releases/latest`, only when
  the button is tapped, with `User-Agent: Thor-Pathfinder` (Android's default
  names the device model). `tag_name` without its `v` is compared number by
  number with versionName. The dialog opens the release's `html_url` if it is
  on github.com, otherwise `/releases/latest`. Unsigned API calls are limited
  to 60 an hour per IP; a 403 or 429 gets its own message.
- **Messages.** `Toast` from the service never shows: Android 13 suppresses
  background toasts from an app without the notification permission
  ("Suppressing toast from package ... by user request" in logcat). The
  service draws its messages as a TYPE_ACCESSIBILITY_OVERLAY window on the
  default display instead (`Overlay.kt`), which needs no permission.
- **Home exclusions** come from HOME and SECONDARY_HOME activities; whole
  packages only when priority >= 0. Android Settings registers FallbackHome at
  -1000, and excluding its package would make Settings unswappable. Launchers
  on the test Thor: launcher3, odinlauncher, cocoonshell and
  `xyz.blacksheep.mjolnir`.
- **Mouse mode.** Switch: system setting `global_gamepad_to_mouse_mode`
  (com.odin.mapping logs "Config changed: Empty->Mouse"). Config:
  `/sdcard/AYN_Thor_Settings/global_mouse_mode_config.json` (folder from
  `ro.product.vendor.model`, spaces to underscores). com.odin.settings is a
  persistent app that loads it once at start-up, and `am force-stop` does not
  restart it, so a change needs a reboot (`svc power reboot`; shell holds
  REBOOT). The right stick is RIGHT_JOYSTICK type 3003
  (ST_MOUSE_MOVE_TOUCHSCREEN, a virtual finger), handled in native
  `librsinput.so`: it copies `reverseJoystick` (+0x30) into the stick state and
  multiplies both swipe axes by -1. `reverseJoystick1` is ignored for this type.
- **Firmware gate.** `Build.DISPLAY` is `Thor_V1.0.0.377_20260206_165408_user`;
  `Device.check` parses the version (newer accepted) and falls back to the
  build time when the name doesn't parse. The update screen is the non-public
  intent `android.settings.SYSTEM_UPDATE_SETTINGS` (com.odin.fota).
- **Compose focus.** Since Compose 1.7, clickables take focus only in keyboard
  input mode, so focus requests are retried when
  `LocalInputModeManager.inputMode` changes. Never rebuild UI to refresh
  values (`key(revision)`): it destroys the focused row and focus jumps away.
- **Controller scrolling.** Compose brings a focused item into view with the
  least scrolling, so focusing the first or last control left the page's
  padding out of sight. `ScrollingColumn` (ui/EdgeScroll.kt) provides a
  `BringIntoViewSpec` (experimental in foundation 1.7) that scrolls to the
  very top or bottom when the item is within 64 dp of that end and still fits
  there, and gives its content the default spec back so dialogs opened inside
  are unaffected. The settings screen and the setup pages use it.
- **List dialogs.** The list gets `weight(1f, fill = false)` inside the
  dialog's Column. Without it, a list taller than the screen (the shortcut
  picker in landscape) squeezed the Cancel button to zero height; the squeezed
  button could still take focus, and Up from the first option jumped to it.

## Testing on the device

- A real Back hold, through the same path as a thumb (shell is in group input):
  `adb shell "sendevent /dev/input/event9 1 158 1; sendevent /dev/input/event9 0 0 0; sleep 1.2; sendevent /dev/input/event9 1 158 0; sendevent /dev/input/event9 0 0 0"`
  (find the node with `getevent -pl`, name "Odin Controller").
- Shizuku's wireless debugging makes the Thor show up twice in
  `adb devices`; pick the USB serial with `adb -s`. In Git Bash with
  `MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1`, give adb.exe Windows paths (`C:/...`) for local files.
  Quote `$` in component names on the device side (YouTube is
  `.app.honeycomb.Shell$HomeActivity`).
- Logs: `adb logcat -s PathfinderSwap PathfinderShell PathfinderMouse`.
- Screens a set-up Thor never shows (debug builds only; `ui/Preview.kt`):
  install `app-debug.apk` (same key, installs over the release build), then
  `adb shell am start -n com.thorpathfinder.app/.ui.MainActivity -f 0x10008000 --es step SHIZUKU --es shizuku NOT_INSTALLED`.
  Other extras: `--ez service false`, `--ez wayfinder true`,
  `--es firmware 1.0.0.300`. Reinstall the release APK afterwards.

## Building

JDK 17 and the Android SDK (platform 35); `local.properties` (gitignored)
points at the SDK. Gradle 8.13, AGP 8.7.2, Kotlin 2.1.0, Compose BOM
2024.10.01, Shizuku 13.1.5.

```bash
./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest :app:assembleRelease --console=plain
```

Escape sequences written through Python or heredocs can land as real line
breaks or control bytes. Write Kotlin escapes with the Edit/Write tools and
check sources for bytes below 0x20 (other than tab/newline) and 0x7F.

## Possible next steps

- A GitHub Actions build (it would need the key as repository secrets).
- Per-app exclusions (for example, leave Select alone in emulators).
- An atomic swap (WindowContainerTransaction) to remove the brief cover.
- Button combinations; opening an app on a chosen screen; translations.
