Guidance for working in this repo.

## What this is

A daily-brief printer. It builds a short briefing (weather, birthdays,
reminders, …) and prints it on a 58mm ESC/POS thermal receipt printer driven by
[python-escpos](https://github.com/python-escpos/python-escpos).

## Where it runs

- **Target hardware:** Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W (arm64, quad-core) on Raspberry Pi
  OS Bookworm + NetworkManager. The printer is attached via USB/serial. arm64
  means prebuilt wheels are available for everything (incl. `anthropic`'s
  pydantic-core), so all deps in `requirements.txt` install normally.
- **Development:** done on a laptop (macOS) using the `dummy` printer backend,
  then deployed to the Pi. Keep all hardware access behind `daily_brief.printer`
  so the rest of the code stays runnable and testable without a printer.
- Python 3.11+ (uses stdlib `tomllib`).

## Architecture

The brief is rendered as **one tall bitmap** (modern TrueType font, thin rules,
checkboxes, weather pictograms) and sent to the printer as a raster image — not
with the built-in ESC/POS text font. That's a deliberate choice: it's the only
way to get a non-receipt look and graphics. The Pi Zero W rasterizes this more
slowly than text, but it's a once-a-day print.

**Data model: section (block) → brief (ordered set) → schedule (time → brief).**
One `config.toml` holds global tables plus `[[briefs]]` (each with nested
`[[briefs.sections]]`) and `[[schedules]]`.

- `daily_brief/config.py` — `load_config()` reads TOML into dataclasses
  (`BriefConfig`, `ScheduleConfig`, `NetworkConfig`, `WebConfig`, …); a legacy
  flat `[[sections]]` file migrates to one "default" brief. `save_config()`
  writes TOML via `tomli_w` (the setup UI uses it; comments aren't preserved, so
  `config.example.toml` stays the documented template). `Config.brief(name)`
  looks one up. Section `options` is a free per-source dict.
- `daily_brief/printer.py` — **the only module that touches hardware.**
  `make_printer(cfg)` returns a python-escpos device (Dummy / Usb / Serial).
- `daily_brief/brief.py` — data model: `Brief` → `Section` → `Item`s
  (`Text`, `Checkbox`, `Bullet`, `Banner`, `KeyVal`, `Weather`, `Picture`,
  `ProgressBar`, `Mono`, `Title`). `Section.icon` is a header pictogram key; `Section.bare` renders items
  with no rule/heading (used by the `greeting` section's centered `Title`). The
  header is just the first section now — there's no special header rendering.
  Sources are data-only; `build_brief(config, brief, ...)` iterates the brief's
  sections.
- `daily_brief/render.py` — `Canvas` (PIL) + `render_brief(printer, brief, cfg)`.
  Draws each Item, crops to height, prints via `printer.image(...)`. `printer`
  may be `None` to only write a PNG preview. No special header — the greeting is
  just the first (bare) section.
- `daily_brief/sources/` — one builder per source, registered in
  `sources/__init__.py` (`BUILDERS`); `build_section` runs each through
  `safe_build`, which turns any failure into an "(unavailable)" section. Header
  icons are off by default except birthdays (`DEFAULT_SECTION_ICONS`); any section
  can opt in with `icon = "<key>"` or out with `icon = ""`. `_http.py` wraps
  `requests` with a timeout + TTL file cache (`~/.cache/daily_brief/`) and stale
  fallback.
  Space sources live in `space.py` (iss/moon/planets). The `ascii` source draws
  a daily piece from `daily_brief/ascii_art.py` as a `Mono` item, or has Claude
  draw it when `use_claude = true`. The `ai` source (`ai.py`) feeds a config
  `prompt` to Claude and prints the answer, capped to `max_chars`; with
  `use_web_search = true` it grants Claude the Anthropic-hosted web search tool
  (`llm.WEB_SEARCH_TOOL`) so the answer can use current info — run server-side,
  resuming the tool loop on `pause_turn`, no local fetching.
- `daily_brief/assets/` — bundled Inter + DejaVu Sans Mono fonts, weather
  pictograms (`weather/`), header/banner icons (`icons/`), and the ISS world map
  (`space/world.png`). Regenerate icons with `scripts/gen_icons.py` /
  `scripts/gen_weather_icons.py`.
- `daily_brief/llm.py` — Claude wrapper (`generate()`). `[claude] enabled` is the
  master toggle; `ClaudeConfig.active` (= `enabled and api_key`) gates everything.
  AI users: the **ai** section (gated by `active`), and **greeting** + **word** +
  **ascii** (each has its own per-section `use_claude`, so AI runs only when
  `use_claude and active`). **When a section's AI call fails it surfaces "(AI
  unavailable)" rather than silently using its local version**; with AI off /
  unkeyed / `use_claude` unchecked, it uses local behavior (rotation / Free
  Dictionary / gallery). The `greeting` source (`sources/greeting.py`) renders the
  centered header (greeting + `date_format` line) and offers `style` presets.
  Each section type's editable fields are described in `sources/specs.py`
  (`SECTION_SPECS`), which drives the web UI's forms + validation.
- `daily_brief/__main__.py` — print CLI (`python -m daily_brief --brief <name>`);
  `--dry-run` writes a PNG preview, `--out` saves the bitmap, `--backend` overrides.
- `daily_brief/daemon.py` — the long-running service (`python -m daily_brief.daemon`).
  `Scheduler` fires schedules at their time (reloads `config.toml` on change);
  `Controller` adds the setup-mode state machine: **offline ⇒ AP + web server up;
  online ⇒ both down**. A GPIO button (`gpiozero`, optional) is multi-gesture:
  **single tap** reprints the last brief (`lastbrief.reprint`, no rebuild),
  **double tap** opens the WiFi setup AP (and prints a notice with the AP
  SSID/password/console URL via `ap_notice_brief`), **5s hold** prints a goodbye
  (`shutdown_notice_brief`) and shuts the Pi down. The console URL is `NetworkConfig.effective_console_host()` — the
  `console_host` override or `<hostname>.local` — served by mDNS so the same URL
  works during setup and on the LAN afterward; the AP gateway IP is a fallback.
  `Scheduler.tick` also calls the mailbox watcher (throttled to `poll_seconds`).
- `daily_brief/lastbrief.py` — saves the rendered bitmap of each printed brief to
  `~/.cache/daily_brief/last_brief.png` (`save()`); `reprint(cfg)` re-sends it to
  the printer so the button's single tap reprints without network/AI/rebuild.
- `daily_brief/mailbox.py` — **inbox watcher, independent of briefs/schedules.**
  `poll_and_print(config)` polls `[email]` over IMAP and prints each new unread
  message from an approved sender as its own receipt, then marks it read. The
  allow-list is by `From:` (`@domain` allows a whole domain); with `require_auth`
  it also requires DKIM/DMARC pass (SPF alone isn't trusted) to resist From
  spoofing. `EmailConfig.active` (= enabled + creds + allow-list) gates it,
  mirroring `ClaudeConfig.active`. Configured via the top-level `[email]` table,
  not a brief section. Uses `render_brief(..., footer=False)` for the receipt.
- `daily_brief/network.py` — `nmcli` wrapper (AP, WiFi join, connectivity). No-ops
  off-Pi (`available()` is False), so the daemon then just runs the scheduler.
  `connect()` builds the profile with an explicit `wifi-sec.key-mgmt wpa-psk`
  (the single radio can't scan while running the AP, so nmcli can't infer
  security). The join and the daemon's AP-reconcile loop both drive `wlan0`, so
  `connect()` calls `suppress_ap()` for the attempt and the loop skips reopening
  the AP while `ap_suppressed()`; a failed join calls `resume_ap()` so setup mode
  returns. The loop also re-derives `ap_active` from `hotspot_active()` each tick.
- `daily_brief/web/` — Flask setup UI (`create_app`), server-rendered Jinja +
  vendored SortableJS (no build). Edits briefs/schedules/settings/WiFi and writes
  `config.toml`. The **Software** page uploads a release tarball and shows the
  last update result (see `updater.py`); the upload is gated by `[web]
  allow_remote_update` (**off by default**). Run standalone: `python -m daily_brief.web`.
- `daily_brief/updater.py` — **remote software update via console upload.** The
  Software page stages an uploaded `.tgz` to `<base>/staging/pending.tgz` and
  triggers the separate `daily-brief-update` oneshot unit; `apply_pending()`
  unpacks it to a fresh `releases/<version>/`, builds its venv, **smoke-tests**
  it (`--dry-run` against the live config) before going live, then atomically
  flips the `current` symlink and restarts the daemon — **health-checking the
  console and rolling back to the previous release if the new one won't start.**
  The layout is anchored on the dir holding `config.toml` (the install base), so
  `config.toml` lives *outside* the swappable releases and is never touched. Run
  by the *old* code, so a broken build can't break the updater. **Gated by
  `[web] allow_remote_update`, which defaults to False** — the route refuses
  uploads and the Software page hides the form unless it's explicitly enabled.
  Off a release-based install (`is_managed()` False, e.g. a dev checkout) the
  form is hidden too. `scripts/setup-releases.sh` migrates a plain checkout to
  the layout; `scripts/build-release.sh` builds the tarball.
- `systemd/daily-brief.service` — runs the daemon **unprivileged** as the
  `daily-brief` user; group membership (netdev/gpio/dialout) + `CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE`
  cover nmcli/GPIO/printer/port-80, and `daily_brief/privilege.py` (`sudo_wrap`)
  shells out via the `systemd/daily-brief.sudoers` drop-in for the only two
  privileged actions left: `shutdown` (button hold) and `systemctl restart`
  (self-update). Points at `current/` + an out-of-releases `config.toml`.
  `systemd/daily-brief-update.service` — oneshot that runs `updater.apply_pending`.
  `scripts/install.sh` is the one-command installer (creates the user/groups/
  sudoers/udev, builds the release layout, installs the units).
- `scripts/printer_test.py` — hardware smoke test + `--list-usb`.
  `scripts/gen_weather_icons.py` — regenerate the weather pictograms.

## Conventions

- Width is in **dots** (`config.render.dot_width`, 384 for 58mm) — the renderer
  word-wraps to pixel width. Don't hardcode widths or assume a char count.
- New content sources must degrade gracefully (network down, no creds) and never
  crash the print job. Return data Items; let `safe_build` handle failures. Use
  `_http.get_json`/`get_text` so caching + fallback come for free.
- To add a source: write `sources/foo.py` with `build(section_cfg, ctx)`,
  register it in `BUILDERS`, add a `SectionSpec` in `specs.py` (so the web UI can
  edit it), and add a `[[briefs.sections]]` block (`type = "foo"`).
- Preview on a laptop with `--dry-run` (opens a PNG); the `dummy` backend still
  works for byte capture. The web UI also renders live previews.
- Secrets / device IDs / calendar URLs / API keys go in `config.toml`
  (gitignored), never in code.

## Common commands

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

python -m daily_brief --dry-run --brief morning   # render to preview.png (no printer)
python -m daily_brief.web                          # setup UI at http://127.0.0.1:8080
python -m daily_brief.daemon --no-setup            # scheduler only (laptop-safe)
python scripts/printer_test.py --backend dummy
pytest

# On the Pi:
python scripts/printer_test.py --list-usb          # find vendor:product id
python -m daily_brief --brief morning --backend usb   # build + print for real
sudo systemctl enable --now daily-brief            # run the daemon on boot
```
