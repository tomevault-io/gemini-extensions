# Working with argot

[argot](https://argot.tmonier.com) is a guardrail that flags code **foreign to a
repo's own patterns** — learned from its git history. Five learned detectors:
a foreign dependency/API/idiom, a function the repo already has, code filed in
the wrong place, an internal import that reverses the repo's layering, and a
test weakened, disabled, or deleted alongside the production change it covers
— plus repo-local **custom rules** the team scripts itself (see below). It
answers *"is this how we write things here?"*, not *"is this valid?"*. This
file tells a coding agent how to use it well. (Developing argot itself? See
`CLAUDE.md`.)

## The contract: surface, don't enforce

argot is a **probabilistic** linter. It has false positives, and its confidence
depends on the repo. **A hit is a prompt to think, never a reason to refuse.**

- Never block a commit, fail a task, or refuse to proceed because argot fired.
- Never auto-"fix" a hit by rewriting code the human didn't ask you to change.
- The human always has the last word. Your job is to *surface* divergences and
  *record decisions*, not to enforce.

## Two moments

1. **Setup (once per repo).** Fit the voice model and decide what shouldn't
   shape it. → `argot init` (also builds the semantic index — the embedding
   model ships inside the binary, so this needs no network). Review and commit
   `argot.toml` **and the generated `.argot/` fit snapshot**; CI consumes that
   snapshot and never fits. Then use the **argot-setup** skill for anything with
   generated/vendored/data directories. See
   [Setup](https://argot.tmonier.com/docs/setup/).
2. **Check (per change).** Before committing code you generated or edited, score
   it. → `argot check`, or the **argot-check** skill.

Snapshot maintenance is adaptive, not scheduled: `argot status` compares the
accepted tree with the fitted source/function/layout profile. Commit count and age are
context only unless the team explicitly configures `[fit] refresh-after` as a
backstop. `watch` is informational; only `recommended` or
`strongly_recommended` should prompt maintenance. Use the **argot-refresh**
skill: `refresh.next_action` says whether to fit directly or review scope first;
the skill also reviews mutes before the local fit, review, and commit. No
command or CI workflow refits automatically.

## Reading `argot check`

Run `argot check --format json` for machine output. Each hit carries a `rule`,
a `severity` (`error`/`warn` — whether it fails the check), a `confidence` tier
(`unusual`/`suspicious`/`foreign` — how strong the evidence is, display only),
an evidence trail, and a stable `hash`. **Branch on the rule, not the
confidence tier** — `redundant` is pinned to `unusual` confidence and is still
one of the most actionable findings argot makes:

| Rule | Group | It means | What to do |
|---|---|---|---|
| `foreign-import` | voice | an import of a dependency the repo has never used | Check the evidence line for what the repo uses instead; prefer the in-voice option unless the new dependency is deliberate. |
| `unfamiliar-callee` | voice | a call to something this kind of file never calls | Same: compare against the named common callees. |
| `rare-tokens` | voice | a token sequence statistically foreign to the repo's voice | Read the flagged identifiers; rewrite with the repo's vocabulary if unintended. |
| `convention` | voice | a construction that breaks a learned repo convention | As above. |
| `superseded` | voice | new code uses a pattern this repo has replaced — mined from history, or declared in `argot.toml` | Use the replacement named in the evidence (the commits that made the switch, or the declared reason). |
| `redundant` | semantic | this new function duplicates one the repo already has | **Open the file the evidence names** (`↳ duplicates X (path:line)`), compare, and use the existing function instead — or justify and mute. |
| `misplaced` | semantic | this function's nearest kin all live in another area | Propose moving it to the named area, or justify its placement. |
| `layering` | architecture | this internal import reverses the repo's layer direction | Don't introduce the import — invert the dependency or go through the intended layer. |
| `test-deleted` | integrity | a test removed while the production code it exercised still exists | Restore the test or explain why it's obsolete; if the deletion is legitimate (feature removed), the code that exercised it should be gone too. |
| `test-disabled` | integrity | a skip/ignore marker added, or a test gutted, while production code changes | Un-skip and fix the code, or record why the skip is temporary; skipping to make a failing suite green is the exact behavior this rule exists to catch. |
| `test-weakened` | integrity | assertions removed, tautologized, or loosened while production code changes | Restore the assertion strength; if the expected value legitimately changed, say why in the commit/PR rather than silently retargeting. |

Rules are configurable like any linter: `argot rules` lists them; `argot.toml
[rules]` or `argot check --rule <name|group>=<error|warn|off>` sets severities.
Everything defaults to `error` except `test-weakened` and `superseded`, which
ship as `warn` (reported, never fails the check) — their finding classes are
real but noisier on routine test churn / mid-migration code.

Declare a migration yourself before history shows enough signal with
`[[migration]]` in `argot.toml` (`from`, `to`, `reason`) — it's effective
immediately, no refit needed: the `to` side stops reading as foreign and the
`from` side raises `superseded`.

**Gauge trust first.** Run `argot inspect` (or MCP `argot.get_fit_status`). If the
verdict is **Not recommended**, down-weight every hit — the model isn't
well-calibrated on this repo yet. **Ready — with notes** is usable as-is; the
notes say what to keep an eye on.

## What it catches — and what a clean run doesn't mean

argot reliably flags a **novel pattern** foreign to this repo (~98% when the
foreign symbol is in the change), a **reinvented function** (the evidence names
the original), **misplaced code**, and a **layering violation** (264/272, 97.1%,
on authored fixtures across 25 corpora / 12 languages). It also flags **tests
weakened, disabled, or deleted alongside a code change** — a test gutted,
skipped, or its assertions loosened while the production code it exercises also
changes — 154/164 (93.9%) authored gaming fixtures across 23 corpora / 12
languages, with 45/3,602 (1.25%) accepted-history test-touching commits flagged
at gating severity and zero fires on 106 legitimate-refactor controls. These are
detector-specific measures, not a product-wide accuracy claim. Trust those hits.

It does **not** reliably catch *in-vocabulary* breaks — where every token is
already in the repo and only the choice is wrong (a bare `ValueError` where the
repo raises `HTTPException`). So **a clean `argot check` means "no foreign
pattern found," not "this is idiomatic."** Don't tell the user their code
matches the repo's conventions on the strength of a clean run.

## When a hit is a real divergence

Look at the evidence line — it names the surprising identifier and what the repo
uses instead (`axios — 0 of 47 imports; common here: react, express, pg`), or
the existing function a `redundant` hit duplicates. If a well-established
in-voice option exists, prefer it. If the foreign choice is deliberate (adopting
a new dependency repo-wide), **record the decision** so the noise stops:

```
argot mute <hash> --reason "adopting axios repo-wide"          # this hit only
argot mute --path 'src/legacy/**' --rule foreign-import \
           --reason "legacy tree, migrating in Q3"             # a standing rule
```

A hash mute is **per hit**: the same finding in a sibling file has its own hash
and stays flagged. When the decision covers a tree, use `--path` — otherwise you
end up committing one mute per file.

## When a hit is a false positive

Expected — argot is probabilistic. Don't contort the code to satisfy it. Mute it
with a reason (committed, so it's an audit trail), or drop an inline note —
optionally scoped to one rule or group:

```python
# argot: ignore-next-line rule=redundant — intentional parallel implementation
```

See [Configure](https://argot.tmonier.com/docs/configure/) for all three
suppression surfaces, and [llms.txt](https://argot.tmonier.com/llms.txt) for the
agent-readable docs mirror. Housekeeping: `argot list-mutes` shows every active
suppression; `argot review-mutes` reports which ones no longer fire
(`--prune` removes them).

## Never

- Never block, fail, or gate on an argot hit.
- Never mute without a real, human-meaningful reason just to silence output.
- Never add whole source directories to `argot.toml`'s `[exclude]` to make it
  quiet — only exclude what genuinely isn't the repo's authored voice (generated,
  vendored, data). When unsure, ask the human.
- Never set a rule to `off` on your own initiative — downgrading to `warn` or
  muting a specific hit with a reason is the recorded, reversible move.

## Custom rules — the repo's own vocabulary

A repo can carry hand-written rules under `.argot/rules/<name>/` (a `rule.toml` manifest plus a
sandboxed Rhai script), committed alongside the code. `argot check` discovers and runs them
fresh every time — no rebuild. Their findings behave exactly like a built-in's: same rule name
in every output, same `[rules]`/`--rule` severities, same inline-comment and `[[mute]]`
suppressions, just under one more group, `custom`. `argot rules` lists them (with their source
directory) right after the built-ins — run it to see a repo's full rule vocabulary, built-in and
custom together.

**When a human asks you to codify a repo convention** ("we never call `X` directly," "raw SQL
isn't allowed outside the query builder"), you can write the rule yourself:

1. Create `.argot/rules/<name>/rule.toml` (`schema = 1`, `name` matching the directory,
   `languages` scoped to where the convention applies) and `check.rhai` (a `ts_query(...)` loop
   calling `report`/`report_span`: `file`, `hunks`, `ts_query`,
   `import_attested`/`callee_attested`, `changeset_paths`, and
   `read_repo_file`/`repo_paths` for rules that must read another file).
2. Add `tests/<case>/{input.<ext>, expected.json}` fixtures — at least one that should fire and
   one that shouldn't.
3. Loop `argot rules test <name>` until every case passes, then let a real `argot check` confirm
   it fires on the intended pattern.

Full manifest schema, the host API reference, and a worked example (`no-print`, banning raw
`print()` calls) are in [Custom rules](https://argot.tmonier.com/docs/custom-rules/). Same
contract as everything else here: writing the rule is yours to do on request, but muting or
softening one of its findings is still the human's call. The **argot-write-rule** skill walks
this exact loop end-to-end, with `argot rules test <name>` as its gate.

**To find a repo's conventions instead of stating one**, run `argot conventions` (`--format json`
for a rule-ready shape). It lists the repo's own vocabulary (the internal API everyone uses) and
its **placement conventions** — where a kind of code lives (*validation in schema files*, *DB
access only in migrations*, *business logic in the service layer, not views*), learned from the
layout with nothing framework-specific hardcoded. The **argot-suggest-rules** skill turns a
chosen convention into a scripted rule as the contrapositive — *this belongs in its home, flag it
elsewhere* — still gated on `argot rules test`.

A rule may be **locked** (`{ severity = "error", locked = true }` in the committed
`argot.toml`): its findings refuse every suppression surface, runtime severity overrides are
ignored, and a diff that weakens the lock — or edits a locked custom rule's files — fires
`rule-tampered` (error, unsuppressable). Do not attempt to mute or soften a locked rule;
surface the finding to the human instead.

## Network

argot needs none to do any of this. Every model it uses ships inside the binary.
In a sandbox with no egress, `init`, `check`, `audit`, and `review` of a local
range all work unchanged. The only request argot makes on its own is a
suppressible once-a-day version check.

## If the binary disagrees with this document

Trust the binary. `argot rules` prints the live rule registry and `argot
<command> --help` the live flags — this file may lag a release behind.

## More

- **Skills:** `argot-setup` (local), `argot-refresh` (review scope/mutes and
  refresh the committed snapshot), `argot-check` (per-diff), `argot-review-pr`
  (review one PR against the repo's voice), `argot-setup-ci` (wire the GitHub
  Action), `argot-write-rule` and `argot-suggest-rules` (codify conventions) —
  install with `npx skills add get-tmonier/argot`.
- **MCP** (proactive + read-only): `argot mcp` exposes
  `argot.get_voice_context` so you can write
  in-voice from the first token — see
  [the agents guide](https://argot.tmonier.com/docs/agents/). When a
  migration applies, `argot.check_hunk`/`argot.explain_hunk` hits carry a `superseded`
  array (`old`/`new`/`evidence`) and `argot.get_voice_context` carries `superseded`
  (`avoid`/`use` pairs) plus a `superseded_note` — the preemptive "don't
  write more of this" signal. `argot.check_changeset` runs the complete configured
  detector pipeline without writing the last-check cache. MCP never fits; setup and
  refresh remain reviewed local CLI/skill workflows.
- **Pre-write guardrail** (Claude Code, opt-in): a `PreToolUse` hook (`argot
  hook`) that *asks* before you introduce a dependency foreign to the repo —
  it ships with the [plugin](https://argot.tmonier.com/docs/plugin/), or
  `argot-setup` can wire it into `.claude/settings.json` for skills-only
  installs. Never auto-blocks; a no-op until the repo is fitted.
- **Voice guide:** `argot describe-voice --out STYLE.md` writes a
  human-readable description of the learned voice (typical callees, familiar
  imports) you can commit and point agents at.
- **History scorecard:** `argot audit` scores the last N commits against the
  voice as it was before them and attributes each finding to its introducing
  commit — ai-assisted / human / unknown, from concrete commit markers only
  (agent trailers, bot authors; never style). `--format json|markdown|html`
  for machine, PR-pasteable, or shareable output; the terminal and html cards
  print a copy-pasteable share caption. Informational: exit 0.
- **Voice badge:** `argot voice-diff <range> --format shields` prints a
  shields.io endpoint JSON (`--format svg` a standalone badge) for a live
  "N% in-voice" README badge; the GitHub Action's `publish-badge: true` keeps
  it fresh on each default-branch push — see
  [CI](https://argot.tmonier.com/docs/ci/#a-voice-badge-for-your-readme).
- **Everything else:** `argot --help` is the full, always-current command
  surface — trust it over any list in a document.
