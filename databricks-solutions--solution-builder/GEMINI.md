## What this project actually is

A **system that generates Databricks demos**. Not one app — **three**, plus a skill:

1. **Generator app** (`app/`) — the user-facing tool. FastAPI + React. A user opens it, picks an industry/capability, chats with a Claude Code agent (via `claude-agent-sdk`), and the agent assembles a personalized demo by reading **blocks** from the skill below. Generated artifacts (demo code, specs, app boilerplate, deployable Databricks assets) land in a per-project directory. The home page has **three entry modes** (a `mode` field on each project): *story* (describe it → agent builds every Databricks resource), *architecture* (draw the diagram first → generate from it), and *genie-code-workshop* (agent writes Genie-Code prompts → you build the resources live in notebooks). The mode picks the agent's Build fork; capability blocks carry a `genie_code_workshop` flag so the workshop tab hides what can't be built via Genie Code (apps, Lakebase, KA, MAS).

2. **Solution-builder skill** (`.claude/skills/databricks-solution-builder/`) — the agent's brain. SKILL.md + reference blocks + stage guides + the template app. The generator's agent reads from here. **The skill is the product; the generator is the UI.** (Formerly named `databricks-demo-generator` — renamed to `databricks-solution-builder`.)

3. **Template app** (`.claude/skills/databricks-solution-builder/app/app_template/`) — a complete Node.js + Express + React Databricks App that ships *as part of every generated demo*. The agent copies + customizes it. It is **NOT** a sub-component of the generator — it's an artifact the generator emits.

4. **Test copies** (`app/test/{app_template_test,app_template_test_simple,luxebeauty_workshop}/`) — runnable, live-workspace-wired copies of the skill's template app + reference demos, used to dogfood + iterate. **The workflow is: debug in the test copy, then sync the working content back into the skill.** They must stay in lockstep. See "Test apps ↔ skill" below.

Plus: **Databricks Agent Skills (DAS)** — cloned into `app/ai_dev_kit/` (dir name kept for path stability) from `github.com/databricks/databricks-agent-skills`, holding ~28 per-resource skills for creating individual Databricks resources (pipelines, dashboards, Genie spaces, KAs, MAS, etc.). Skills live under `skills/*` + `experimental/databricks-genie`; the generator's agent uses these during the Build stage. (Migrated from the retired `databricks-solutions/ai-dev-kit`.)

## Mental model

```
USER opens generator app (app/)
   ↓ chats with agent
AGENT reads .claude/skills/databricks-solution-builder/
   - SKILL.md → 4-stage workflow (Intent → Design → Spec → Build)
   - references/blocks/{domains,capabilities,patterns}/*.md
   - stages/0X-*.md
   ↓
AGENT writes specs + scaffolds a Databricks App by copying app_template/
AGENT delegates resource creation to subagents using Databricks Agent Skills (DAS)
   ↓
ARTIFACTS land in:
   - per-project directory (specs, code)
   - the user's Databricks workspace (catalog, schema, pipeline, dashboard, app)
```

★ = files you'll touch most.

## The agent loop (most important thing to know)

`app/src/demo_prompt_generator/backend/services/agent.py`:

- Wraps `claude-agent-sdk>=0.2.83` (Python). One `ClaudeSDKClient` per project, pooled.
- Streams via SSE: thinking blocks, text deltas, tool calls/results.
- Routes through Databricks Foundation Model API in prod (`ANTHROPIC_BASE_PATH`), direct Anthropic locally.
- The agent gets `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=<project>/.claude` so it reads project-local skills (the solution-builder skill is copied into each project on creation by `skills_manager.py`).
- **The chat panel in the UI is the agent's mouth.** Reasoning/thinking blocks render there.

## Reapers / background sweeps (memory + disk reclamation)

Four periodic sweeps keep resource use bounded. The three that need the DB engine /
stream manager live in **`backend/core/reapers.py`** (the single home) and are
started/stopped by `start_reapers(app)` / `stop_reapers(app)` from the **Lakebase
lifespan** (where the engine + `file_sync` are up). The preview-apps idle sweep is
wired separately in `app.py` (needs no DB).

| Sweep | Where started | Cadence | What it reclaims |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Agent-session reaper** | `reapers.py` ← Lakebase lifespan | 5 min (`CLIENT_IDLE_TIMEOUT`) | Disconnects idle `ClaudeSDKClient` Node subprocesses (`ClientPool.reap_idle()`); also `sweep_expired()`s terminal `ActiveStream`s so `_streams` stays bounded. |
| **Project-file cleanup** | `reapers.py` ← Lakebase lifespan | 30 min, 12 h threshold | Deletes a project's **on-disk folder** (orphan = no DB row, OR untouched >12 h). |
| **Rogue-preview reaper** | `reapers.py` ← Lakebase lifespan | 5 min, 15 min threshold | Kills a `start.sh` preview the AGENT left running outside the registry (see below). |
| **Preview-apps sweep** | `preview/registry.py` ← `app.py` | 5 min | Stops idle registry-launched `start.sh` preview web-server subprocesses. |

**Invariants — do not break these:**
- **The DB is the durable store; the on-disk `projects/<id>/` folder is a disposable
  cache.** No reaper deletes DB rows (Project / Message / ProjectFile, incl. the
  `.claude/projects/**` Claude session transcript that powers resume). The project-file
  cleanup only rmtrees the folder; `restore_project_from_db` rebuilds it (and re-anchors
  the transcript so `resume=session_id` still works) on next open. Before removing a
  still-existing project's folder it `full_sync_project`s (delete-free) to flush any
  un-synced change to the DB first — atomic with the rmtree under the cleaning flag +
  restore lock.
- **⚠️ Folder deletion must never cascade to DB-row deletion.** The file watcher is a
  single recursive Observer over `projects/`; its flush (`sync_files_to_db`) deletes the
  `ProjectFile` row for any path missing on disk. `shutil.rmtree` unlinks children before
  the dir, so mid-rmtree the folder still `exists()` while files vanish. `sync_files_to_db`
  therefore **skips ALL delete-processing when the project is in the cleaning-set
  (`is_cleaning`) OR its folder is absent** — a vanished/mid-delete folder means "cache
  gone", never "user emptied the project". `remove_project_files_on_disk` sets that flag
  and holds the per-project **restore lock** across `full_sync`+`rmtree` (so a concurrent
  `restore_project_from_db` can't capture a half-deleted tree). Keep both.
- **Nothing is reaped/disconnected while a turn is in flight.** Authoritative signal =
  the **ActiveStream** (`get_stream_manager().get_project_stream`), NOT the pool's
  `is_busy`. A background run (tabs closed) stays alive because its stream is live.
  `reap_idle` **force-reaps a stuck `is_busy`+no-stream client** as a backstop; the
  historical leak was a cancelled/abandoned turn leaving `is_busy=True` forever (release
  was outside the try/finally, and `CancelledError`/`GeneratorExit` bypassed it), so
  `stream_agent_response` now clears `is_busy` in a `finally` on every exit. `register_client`/
  `remove_client` also refuse to disconnect a client whose project has a live stream
  (they drop the pool entry and let that turn's finally close it) — this prevents the
  Stop→re-send and clear-session-mid-turn use-after-disconnect. Idle timing uses
  `time.monotonic()` (clock-step safe).

**Rogue-preview reaper + the two preview paths.** There are TWO ways `start.sh` runs:
(1) the **UI Start-Preview** button → the `PreviewRegistry` spawns it and writes
`.preview.server.pid` (registry-owned); (2) the **agent's Bash tool** running `./start.sh`
for a smoke test and forgetting to kill it (rogue). `start.sh` itself writes `.preview.pgid`
(the Node process group) for **both**. So the discriminator is: **`.preview.pgid` present +
`.preview.server.pid` ABSENT = agent-spawned/untracked.** The rogue reaper kills such a
group only when it's >15 min old (grace for a legit smoke test), the project has no
in-flight stream, and the process validates as a node/start.sh tree; registry-owned
previews (both files) are left to the preview-apps sweep. The registry writes
`.preview.server.pid` right after spawn — before start.sh writes `.preview.pgid` — so a
starting UI preview never looks rogue.

**Preview kill = double `setsid`.** `start.sh` does `exec setsid npm run dev`, so Node
runs in a process group that ESCAPES start.sh's own group. Killing must target BOTH:
start.sh's group AND the Node group from `.preview.pgid`. `preview/process.py`'s shared
`kill_process_tree(ident, is_pgid=, validate=)` handles this, walks descendants via
`pgrep`→`ps` (works without `pgrep`, which prod containers may lack). `validate=True`
guards PID/PGID reuse by checking the command looks like a preview tree — for a GROUP,
iff ANY LIVE MEMBER matches (via `ps -g`), NOT the group leader: `setsid` makes the
leader's pid == pgid at creation, but that leader routinely exits while the group lives
on via node/tsx/esbuild children, so validating the (dead) leader would refuse to kill
exactly the orphans we're reaping. `psutil` is NOT a dependency — stdlib + `pgrep`/`ps`.

**Session teardown is by client OBJECT identity, not project_id.** A turn's finally
tears down the specific `PooledClient` it owns (`release_client(..., own=)` /
`remove_client(..., own=)`), guarded by `_clients[pid] is own`. A newer turn
(Stop→re-send) can replace `_clients[pid]` before the old turn's finally runs; looking
up by project_id would then orphan the old client's subprocess AND clear the new turn's
`is_busy`. When superseded, the old turn disconnects its OWN client (register_client
declined to, on that promise). External callers (clear-session/delete) pass no `own`
and act by project_id (delete uses `force=True` + `run_coroutine_threadsafe` onto the
app loop — the pool's `asyncio.Lock` is bound to that loop, so a fresh `asyncio.run()`
loop would mismatch).

## The preview/review mode

Every generated demo ships with a Databricks App under `<project>/app/`. The user clicks **Start Preview** in the project workspace and the generator runs that app **inside the generator's own container**, then proxies it into an iframe. Live HTML + live agent, no deploy step.

### Lifecycle

A `PreviewRegistry` singleton (one per uvicorn process, lives for the app's lifespan) tracks one `PreviewState` per project. State machine: **stopped → starting → ready → (failed | stopped)**. The UI subscribes to `/api/preview/{id}/events` (SSE) and gets state transitions + log lines as they happen.

When the user clicks Start:
1. Registry asks the kernel for a free port via `bind(("127.0.0.1", 0))`, **excluding** the parent's `DATABRICKS_APP_PORT` and any port already promised to another preview.
2. Spawns `<project>/app/start.sh` with `DATABRICKS_APP_PORT=<picked>` **and `FLASK_RUN_HOST=127.0.0.1`** in env. Both are critical (see the prod-bind story below).
3. A readiness probe polls the port; first successful TCP connect flips the state to `ready` and the iframe is told to load.

`stop` kills the subprocess tree. An idle sweep stops previews after 5 min of inactivity and a global cap keeps total concurrent previews bounded (defaults defined in `backend/preview/registry.py`).

**Only the UI drives lifecycle — the agent never runs `start.sh`.** The agent's transcript wouldn't capture process state anyway, and concurrent agent-spawned processes would race the registry.

### Reverse proxy + HTML rewrite

`/preview/{id}/{path}` forwards every request to `http://127.0.0.1:<picked>/<path>`. The proxy is more than a pipe — it has to make the child app **think it lives at the iframe origin**, even though it actually lives under a `/preview/<id>/` prefix.

For that it does two things:

- **HTML rewrite on the way out**: absolute-path `href="/foo"` / `src="/foo"` get prefixed to `/preview/<id>/foo`. Inline `<script type="module">` import paths get the same treatment.
- **Runtime shim injected into the child's `<head>`**: patches `fetch`, `XMLHttpRequest`, `WebSocket`, and `EventSource` so the child's own runtime calls also get rewritten. Sets `window.__PREVIEW_BASENAME__ = "/preview/<id>"` so the child's router can use it as basename. **This is the most surprising piece** — if a preview loads but its data fetches 404, that's where to look.

The shim also installs an error catcher that POSTs uncaught JS errors and unhandled rejections to `/preview/<id>/api/log/client-error`. Those land in the parent's server logs alongside the child's stdout/stderr — useful for debugging a blank preview.

### Logs

Each `PreviewState` owns a bounded `LogBuffer`. The child's stdout + stderr stream into it line-by-line (tagged `stdout` / `stderr` / `system`). The SSE feed at `/api/preview/{id}/events` carries both **state events** and **log lines** with a cursor so reconnects can replay missed lines. The UI's "Preview logs" panel reads this feed.

When something breaks the order to look:
1. **The logs panel** — child startup errors usually scream here.
2. **Browser console** — the shim's error catcher echoes uncaught errors to the parent's server stderr, but they're also right there in the iframe's console.
3. **The parent's uvicorn stderr** — anything the shim catcher posts lands here.

### Why both `DATABRICKS_APP_PORT` *and* `FLASK_RUN_HOST=127.0.0.1`

AppKit's server plugin defaults to `host=0.0.0.0`. In the prod Databricks Apps container, the parent **must** bind `0.0.0.0:DATABRICKS_APP_PORT` (the platform proxy targets that). If the child binds `0.0.0.0:<picked_port>` and the kernel ever hands the parent's port back to `_pick_free_port` (rare, but possible in some ephemeral-range deployments), both processes end up listening on the parent's external port and the load balancer round-robins between them — users intermittently get the **child's HTML on the parent's URL**.

Forcing the child to `127.0.0.1` turns that race into a hard `EADDRINUSE` at child start (`127.0.0.1:N` conflicts with `0.0.0.0:N` on bind). The child fails loudly, registry picks a new port, no silent shadowing. See the commit / comment in `registry.py:_do_start` for the full story.

Same env in local dev — no behavior change there.

## The architecture-diagram editor (`platform-diagram/`)

The "Architecture" tab is a Lucidchart-style ReactFlow (`@xyflow/react`) editor for the demo's Databricks architecture. It reads/writes the project's `architecture.md` and auto-saves (debounced) on every change. A module DAG under `ui/components/project/platform-diagram/`:

```

```

Dependency direction is a strict leaf→root DAG (shared/edge-routing → edge-flow/composites → component-node/flow-edge → node-types/flow-mapping/panels/menus → canvas → platform-diagram). The custom Canvas hooks own the undo/redo burst machinery, the node/edge mutators, and paste. Selection comes from ReactFlow's `selected` NodeProp, edit mode from `EditModeContext`, draggability from `<ReactFlow nodesDraggable>` — node `data` identity stays stable so `React.memo` holds.

### Two layers: the FILE format vs the ReactFlow binding (keep separate)

- **`lib/platform-architecture.ts` — the file-format + catalog layer.** This is where most architecture logic lives. It owns:
  - The **flat `architecture.md` format**: `{ name, story, options, columns?, nodes[], edges[] }`. A node is on the canvas iff it's in `nodes`. **No bands / state / hidden / catalog-diffing in the file** — that model was cut over (no `buildSchema`/`seedEdges`/overrides anymore).
  - `parseArchitecture(content)` → the internal resolved `PlatformSchema` ({bands, layout}) the canvas consumes; `serializeArchitecture(schema, layout)` → writes the flat file back. (The internal `{bands, layout}` shape is kept ONLY so `flow-mapping.ts` + the node components didn't have to change.)
  - The **`CATALOG`** (single source of truth): every component with `id`/`label`/`icon`/`desc`/`kind`/`sublabel` + authoring metadata (`authoring` one-liner, `ports` map). `CATALOG_BY_ID` is the lookup; `naturalSize(type)` gives each kind's [w,h]. The file lists only what's placed; the library palette renders the full catalog.
  - **`computeLayout(file)`** — resolves SYMBOLIC placement → pixels. **Author structure, not coordinates:** `columns: [...]` + per-node `col`/`row` stack nodes in left→right lanes; **relational fields** `alignX`/`alignY` (copy another node's center on an axis — with a `col` the node stays in-lane and its lane-mates re-stack to open a slot), `below`/`above`/`leftOf`/`rightOf`(+`gap`) place a node beside another (siblings on the same anchor fan out; a still-overlapping satellite nudges clear) — computeLayout de-overlaps these automatically; `wraps: [ids]`+`pad` makes a `type:"box"` auto-size around children (recursive → cloud/VPC nesting); `bounds: {side:"<id>:<anchor>"}` cuts a box edge at a node/column midpoint; `pin: "bottom-left"`+`pinTo` docks banners into a box corner (non-`float` pins RESERVE a band so the box grows and they don't overlap content). **Explicit `at` always wins.** **PER-NODE round-trip (not all-or-nothing):** parse stashes each node's symbolic fields in `NodePosition.placement` + a `pinned` flag; on save `serializeArchitecture` re-emits the symbolic fields for any UNMOVED node and only writes pixel `at` for nodes the user actually dragged (canvas `handleNodesChange` sets `pinned` on the drop frame) or that were authored with `at`. So dragging one box no longer flattens the whole tab.
  - Edges: `from`/`to` by node id. The `@handle` is either **explicit** (`to: "lakeflow-genie-block@in-zerobus"`) or **inferred** (L→R `@r`/`@l`). **There is NO `ingest` field anymore** — a source→Lakeflow edge names the ingest PORT via its target `@in-*` handle (`@in-lakeflow-connect` / `@in-zerobus` / `@in-direct`), and that handle drives BOTH the port anchor AND the flow animation (zerobus→particles, direct→docs, else→laser). `arrow` (auto/none/end/start/both) — `auto` draws relationship arrows for Genie-One edges.
- **`flow-mapping.ts` — the ReactFlow-binding layer.** `schemaToFlow` / `flowToEdge` (resolved schema → `Node[]`/`Edge[]`) and `flowToLayout` (live graph → persisted layout). No file parsing here.

### Composite node kinds

Beyond the plain `component` tile, each composite is its own node type + `composite-*.tsx`. `CompositeKind` (in `platform-architecture.ts`) is: `lakeflow` / `lakeflow-genie` (3-port ingest rail + medallion; `lakeflow-genie` adds a Genie Code footer — the preferred data block), `governance` (UC + AI Gateway + Genie Ontology bar), `agent-bricks` (supervisor tree), `genie-code`, `db-platform` (wordmark banner), and **`genie-one`** (the business-user entry tile — the "Business users" persona pill is built INTO it, so no separate `file:persona/user` node is needed). A composite's `kind` lives on its catalog entry; `nodeTypeFor` maps kind→ReactFlow type; `cardStyle` lets border/shadow/fill controls apply uniformly (db-platform + governance default to no border/shadow).

### The skill catalog is GENERATED from the code catalog

`app/scripts/gen-architecture-skill.ts` (`bun run gen:arch-skill`) writes the component catalog + icon-bank sections **directly into `.claude/skills/databricks-architecture/SKILL.md`** (between `<!-- BEGIN/END: generated-catalog -->` and `<!-- BEGIN/END: generated-icons -->`), derived from `CATALOG`. It also runs a build-time **drift guard**: prose that references an `@in-*` port not in `CATALOG.ports` fails the build. After changing a component's label/desc/`authoring`/`ports`, re-run it so the skill can't drift. The rest of that SKILL.md (workflow, format, authoring rules, Sources) is hand-written. (NOTE: this is *generation into the skill*; how the skill is *packaged/shipped* — pure vs in-app — is a separate concern, covered next.)

**Merge/rebase conflicts in the generated artifacts** (the arch `SKILL.md` catalog/icon-bank blocks + the two renderer HTMLs) — **don't hand-merge them.** They're derived from `platform-architecture.ts` (+ `standalone.tsx`), which merges cleanly on its own. Resolve each conflicted artifact to *either* side (e.g. `git checkout --theirs`), finish the merge/rebase, then run `cd app && bun run build:arch-skill` to **regenerate them from the merged source** — that produces the correct combined result (e.g. one side's renamed ids + the other's node sizes). Commit the regen.

## Live collaboration on the architecture canvas (WS)

The Architecture tab supports **N-user live editing**: shared cursors, live edits, and AI-agent takeover — all over ONE WebSocket per project. It's **in-app only** (never the standalone skill / read-only previews — the collab hook is gated `enableCollab && !onSave && !readOnly`, so the standalone canvas is byte-identical to before).

**Transport + hub (backend).** `services/collab.py` = an in-process `CollabHub` (singleton, like `ActiveStreamManager`), one `CollabRoom` per project. `routes/collab.py` = the `@router.websocket("/api/projects/{id}/collab")` endpoint (WS auth reuses `_get_project_access`; identity from the same `X-Forwarded-Email`/`-Preferred-Username` headers HTTP uses). Fan-out is plain asyncio — **single-replica only** (the hub is behind a tiny surface so a future multi-replica story could swap in Postgres `LISTEN/NOTIFY`, but that's not built). Frames (small JSON): `presence`/`writer` (roster + who persists), `cursor` (in FLOW coords, so a peer's cursor maps correctly at any zoom/pan), `op` (an edit — a whole serialized tab body, server-stamped `seq`), `snapshot` (full `architecture.md` for late-joiners + agent takeovers), `ping` (liveness).

**Consistency model — one elected WRITER + per-object LWW.** Exactly one room member (first editor in; re-elected on leave) PERSISTS `architecture.md`; everyone else applies ops and never saves (kills the multi-writer clobber). Client `isWriter` is TRUE only when the server confirmed our connId — a fresh joiner is NOT a writer until confirmed (closes the election-window double-persist race). Remote ops apply through the diagram's existing re-seed path in `platform-diagram.tsx` (the "Live collaboration" section there: `applyRemoteOp`/`applySnapshot`/writer-gated `writeTabs`), ordered by `seq` (stale/out-of-order ops dropped).

**AI-agent takeover (the unification).** The agent always writes `architecture.md` on disk → the file-watcher `sync_callback` in `lakebase.py` calls `hub.maybe_broadcast_external_write`, which broadcasts a `snapshot(source:"agent")` so every client hard-reseeds + shows a toast. A **content-hash echo-guard** (`note_saved` on the `saveProjectFile` route + `note_baseline` on join) tells the agent's write apart from the room writer's OWN save — so a human save never triggers a false takeover.

**Ghost reaping / dev gotchas.** The client heartbeats a `ping` every ~20s; the server reaps a socket silent for ~60s (`MAX_MISSED` idle windows) — this drains half-open ghosts that a `send` wouldn't error on. The `use-collab` effect cleanup closes an abandoned CONNECTING socket **on open** (React StrictMode dev double-mount would otherwise leave a ghost member → the "count doubles" bug). **DEV ONLY:** `vite.config.ts` must set `ws: true` on the `/api` proxy or the collab WS upgrade is dropped behind Vite (prod serves one origin, no proxy — unaffected).

**Sharing model + "Share live".** Two access paths (owner-managed, `share-dialog.tsx`): (1) **email invites** (`ProjectShare`, viewer/editor, accept-to-grant — the pre-existing path); (2) **"Anyone with the link"** — a new `Project.link_access` field (`none`/`viewer`/`editor`, migration `v16`) that `_get_project_access` honors so any signed-in app user who opens the URL gets that role WITHOUT an invite (set via owner-only `PATCH /projects/{id}/link-access`). The canvas floating toolbar has a **"Share live"** button (badge = live member count) that opens the dialog prefilled with `window.location.href` (the deep link incl. `?tab=architecture&archTab=…`). A URL carrying `?archTab=` implies the Architecture tab even without `?tab=`, so a shared link mounts the canvas (+ its collab room) on open.

## The architecture skill: two modes + the render/feedback loop

The `databricks-architecture` skill (`.claude/skills/databricks-architecture/`) is **one source of truth, consumed two ways.** There is a single skill dir on disk — `SKILL.md` + `reference/*.jsonc` + `renderer/` (the standalone viewer/editor HTMLs + `render-arch.mjs`). Both the HTMLs and `render-arch.mjs` are BUILT from the app: `cd app && bun run build:arch-skill` (= `build-architecture-skill.sh`) does 3 steps — (1) `gen:arch-skill` regenerates SKILL.md's catalog/icon-bank, (2) `build:arch-standalone` builds the two HTMLs from `ui/standalone.tsx` via `vite.standalone.config.ts` (ARCH_MODE=viewer|editor), (3) copies the HTMLs + `scripts/render-arch.mjs` into the skill's `renderer/`. **This is a dev-time step you run before committing — it is NOT run at app start.** `render-arch.mjs`'s source of truth is `app/scripts/render-arch.mjs`; the skill copy is a build artifact — edit the source, not the copy.

### Mode 1 — Pure skill (standalone, outside the app)

`install.sh` (or a repo tarball) installs the skill dir **whole, including `renderer/`**, into `~/.claude/skills/` (or `./.claude/skills` with `--project`). `install.sh` installs BOTH `databricks-solution-builder` AND `databricks-architecture` (a `SKILLS=(…)` array it loops over). With no app around, the agent's feedback loop is **file + headless-browser**:

```
cp renderer/architecture-viewer.html my-arch.html   # edit the inline JSON
node renderer/render-arch.mjs my-arch.html           # → my-arch.png
# read my-arch.png, fix the JSON, repeat
```

`render-arch.mjs` drives **`chromium-headless-shell`** (Playwright's minimal headless build — `npx playwright install chromium-headless-shell`) over CDP and screenshots the rendered canvas to PNG. `findChrome()` auto-discovers the shell in the Playwright cache (falls back to full chromium, then system Chrome; `CHROME_PATH` overrides). SKILL.md ships this local render-loop workflow intact.

### Mode 2 — In-app (Solution Builder)

Two layers:
1. **Wheel/build:** `app/scripts/build.sh` packages the **full** skill dir (incl. `renderer/`) into the wheel — the backend also serves `architecture-editor.html` for its viewer feature.
2. **Per-project, at RUNTIME:** `skills_manager.copy_skills_to_project()` copies the skill into `<project>/.claude/skills/`, **excludes `renderer/`** (`ignore_patterns("renderer", …)`), and calls **`_localize_arch_skill_for_app(SKILL.md)`** — which strips the `local-render-workflow` / `local-render-files` marker blocks and injects the `in-app-workflow` block (the `_ARCH_SKILL_IN_APP_WORKFLOW` text). So the in-app flavor is **derived at project creation, not a second build** — no drift risk.

In-app there's no headless browser; **the user's live React canvas IS the renderer**, and the agent gets an image via a browser-screenshot loop:

```
agent writes architecture.md  →  ReactFlow canvas re-renders live
user focuses the chat input  +  diagram changed since last snapshot
   →  browser screenshots the .react-flow canvas (html-to-image; right-side panels are OUTSIDE it, so excluded)
   →  PUT /api/projects/{id}/architecture-snapshot  (base64 PNG; operation_id saveArchitectureSnapshot, project_files.py)
   →  backend writes <project>/architecture.png
agent reads architecture.png to SEE its work → iterates
```

The capture is **lazy + change-gated**: a dirty flag (`archDirtyRef` in `project.$projectId.tsx`) flips whenever `architectureContent` changes (agent rewrite or user edit); `captureArchitectureIfDirty()` fires on the chat input's `onInputFocus` (wired via ChatPanel's `onInputFocus` prop) — so it captures at most once per edit-session, not on every drag. Best-effort: if the Architecture tab isn't mounted, `captureDiagramPngDataUrl()` returns null and it skips. The localized SKILL.md + the Architecture-tab context hint both tell the agent to read `architecture.png`.

| | **Mode 1 — pure skill** | **Mode 2 — in-app** |
|---|---|---|
| Ships `renderer/`? | yes | excluded per-project (in the wheel though) |
| SKILL.md | full (local render loop) | localized (in-app loop injected) |
| Render surface | headless-shell → PNG file | live React canvas |
| Feedback PNG | `my-arch.png` via `render-arch.mjs` | `architecture.png` via browser screenshot on chat-focus |
| Browser dependency | `chromium-headless-shell` | none (the user's own tab) |

### Legacy-format migration nudge

`isLegacyArchitectureFormat()` (`platform-architecture.ts`) detects the OLD pre-flat-file schema (`columns` as objects, no top-level `nodes`). When a project loads a legacy `architecture.md`, the frontend sends the agent `ARCHITECTURE_MIGRATION_PROMPT` **once per project** (guarded by a `localStorage` flag + `legacyMigrationSentRef`) asking it to migrate to the new schema grounded in the README story.

## Test apps ↔ skill: debug-live-then-sync workflow

The skill is the **shipped source of truth** — but its template app + reference demos are *blueprints* you can't run in place. So under `app/test/` we keep **runnable copies wired to a live workspace** (e2-demo-west). **The invariant: debug + visualize interactively in the test copy, then sync the working content back into the skill.** Test copy = debug surface; skill = product. Keep them in lockstep.

**The three test copies** (each mirrors one skill artifact):

| Test copy | Mirrors (skill source of truth) | What it is / how you run it |
|---|---|---|
| `app/test/app_template_test/` | template app → `…/app/app_template/`; demo assets → `references/example-luxebeauty/` | **FULL** demo. `app/` (runnable template fork, `./start.sh` → :8765) + `src/` (all Databricks assets) + `databricks.yml` DAB. LuxeBeauty resources wired in (Lakebase, MAS, dashboard, Genie…); IDs in `resources.json`. |
| `app/test/app_template_test_simple/` | `references/example-luxebeauty-simple/` | **SIMPLE** demo variant (`src/` only, no app/DAB): synth data → AI/BI dashboard + Genie (optional app). |
| `app/test/luxebeauty_workshop/` | `references/example-luxebeauty-workshop/` | **GENIE CODE WORKSHOP**. `src/` (notebooks whose cells are Genie-Code prompts + data_generation + pipeline answer-key SQL + CONTEXT.md + specs) + `deploy.sh` (generates raw data → a UC Volume, uploads notebooks to a workspace folder). |

(`app/test/architecture/` is **not** a test app — it's the gitignored render-loop scratch dir for the `databricks-architecture` skill.)

**Why the copies exist:** to **debug** against a live workspace without regenerating a demo from scratch, **test** changes end-to-end (boot, chat, agent loop, preview, deploy — or, for the workshop, the actual notebook prompts), and then **sync** the verified content into the skill.

**Workflow when fixing bugs or adding features:**

1. **Edit the test copy first.** Run it (`./start.sh` for the template app; `./deploy.sh` for the workshop) and verify against the live workspace / browser.
2. Once it works, **sync the changed files back into the matching skill artifact** with `cp`. Use `diff -rq` between the two trees to catch drift.
3. For the template app: `TEMPLATE_MAP.md` marks files structural (sync across demos) vs domain-specific (LuxeBeauty branding/schema/prompts — these intentionally diverge; don't sync). Assets/notebooks sync 1:1 into their `references/example-luxebeauty{,-simple,-workshop}/` counterpart.

**LuxeBeauty assets** (deployed by hand, source-controlled in each `src/`) include the SDP pipeline, AI/BI dashboard, Genie space, Knowledge Assistant, Multi-Agent Supervisor, metric view, ML model (full demo). IDs land in `resources.json`; source files under `src/<asset_type>/` let the demo be re-created from scratch (see `app/test/app_template_test/src/README.md`).

## App development (`app/`) — backend + frontend patterns

Full-stack: **FastAPI + SQLModel + Lakebase** backend, **React 19 + TanStack Router + Tailwind v4 + shadcn/ui** frontend. Frontend calls `/api/*`; in dev Vite proxies to uvicorn, in prod FastAPI serves the built frontend statically.

### Backend (`src/demo_prompt_generator/backend/`)

```
app.py       # create_app() + router
models.py    # ALL SQLModel tables + Pydantic schemas (single file)
router.py    # imports + registers all route modules
core/        # _factory (app+lifespan+static), _config (AppConfig), _headers,
             #   dependencies (DI aliases), lakebase (engine, migrations, session)
routes/      # one module per resource: agent, projects, project_files (incl
             #   architecture-snapshot PNG), messages, templates, resources,
             #   skills, config, constants, block_factory,
             #   collab (WS /projects/{id}/collab — live arch editing)
services/    # agent (SDK+streaming), llm_service (FMAPI), file_sync, file_watcher,
             #   skills_manager, template_service, block_factory, system_prompt,
             #   active_stream (agent SSE), collab (live-edit WS hub — see below)
```

- **DI:** use the `Dependencies` class in handlers, never build clients manually — `Dependencies.{Session, Client (app SP), UserClient (OBO), Config, Headers}`.
- **New route:** file in `routes/`, `create_router()`, endpoints with **`response_model` + `operation_id` (both required** — drive client codegen), register in `router.py`.
- **Models — 3-model pattern** in `models.py`: `Entity` (SQLModel `table=True`) / `EntityCreate|In` (Pydantic input) / `EntityOut` (Pydantic output).

### Frontend (`src/demo_prompt_generator/ui/`)

```
main.tsx                 # entry (React Query + Router)
routeTree.gen.ts         # AUTO-GENERATED — never edit
routes/                  # file-based (TanStack): index, project.$projectId (the
                         #   workspace), projects, gallery, templates, profile, setup…
components/{ui,project,layout}/   # shadcn primitives / workspace / app shell
lib/custom-api.ts        # ★ hand-written API client (types + fetch + SSE) — the primary client
lib/{config,utils}.ts    # apiUrl() base resolution; cn() class merge
styles/globals.css       # Tailwind + oklch CSS custom properties
```

- **Routing:** file-based; `project.$projectId.tsx` → `/project/:projectId`. Don't edit `routeTree.gen.ts`.
- **API client:** `lib/custom-api.ts` (hand-written, fully typed). `invokeAgent()` returns an `execution_id`, then `streamAgentProgress(id, signal)` yields typed SSE events. `lib/api.ts` is an auto-generated OpenAPI backup.
- **State:** local `useState`/`useRef` (no global store; Zustand present but unused; React Query available but the workspace page fetches manually).
- **Workspace page** (`routes/project.$projectId.tsx`): two panels — left file-viewer (tabs: overview/story/architecture/files/app), right resizable ChatPanel (SSE streaming + reasoning). Owns the legacy-migration nudge + the architecture-snapshot capture (see arch section above).

- **shadcn/ui:** add primitives manually from the shadcn registry into `components/ui/`.
- **Testing:** Playwright E2E in `tests/` (repo root) targets `http://localhost:9000` (prod-mode server, not the split dev ports).

### Preview-gated features (`?preview=on`)

In-progress / not-yet-GA UI is hidden behind a **preview flag** so it can ship to
`main` without exposing it to everyone. The mechanism (in `ui/routes/index.tsx`):
`?preview=on` enables it and **persists to `localStorage["preview-features"]`**
(so it stays on across visits without the param); `?preview=off` disables it; with
no param the stored value wins (default **off**). Gate a feature by rendering it
only when the `previewEnabled` state is true. **Currently gates:** the "Genie Code
workshop" home tab. Add future preview features to the same flag (one shared
`preview-features` key — don't invent a per-feature param).

(Run/build commands live under **Quick commands** below.)

## Key concepts

- **Block** — Markdown file with YAML frontmatter under `references/blocks/{domains,capabilities,patterns}/`. The agent composes these to build a demo's context.
- **Project** — A user workspace under `app/projects/<id>/` containing generated files + a Claude conversation.
- **Template** (in the generator's sense) — A published project snapshot that other users can fork (NOT to be confused with the `app_template/` Databricks-App template).
- **resources.json** — Per-demo manifest of every Databricks resource that's been created (catalog, schema, pipeline_id, dashboard_id, KA id, MAS id, app name, …). The agent writes to it during Stage 3 Build.

## Initial (seed) templates — `initial_templates/`

The pre-built **official** templates seeded into the DB on startup (so a fresh workspace has a gallery to fork from). `manifest.json` (`owner_email` + `templates[]` with `id`/`directory`/`name`/`customer`/`industry`/`capabilities`) lists them; **`id` == `directory` == the folder-name slug** (stable, not a UUID). `industry` MUST be one of `backend/core/constants.py::INDUSTRIES`.

**Seeding is a SMOOTH UPSERT keyed by folder-name id** (`seed_templates.py`), NOT insert-only, and runs **fire-and-forget in a background thread** (`lakebase.py` flips `db_ready=True` BEFORE launching it — the app never waits on seeding; the gallery is briefly empty on a cold first boot, then fills). Per template it computes a cheap **stat-based signature** (`_folder_signature` — hash of each eligible file's `(path, size, mtime)` + the screenshot + metadata, NO content reads) and: **skips** if it matches the stored `content_checksum` (fast path — a handful of `stat()`s, no file reads, no BLOB load), **inserts** if the id is new (`official=True`, `status=APPROVED`), or **diff-updates** if it changed — reading the files only then, via the shared `template_service.py::_upsert_template_content(session, id, files)` which touches only changed/added/removed `TemplateContent` rows (unchanged rows keep their ids). File add/remove/rename all change the signature; only a size-AND-mtime-preserving edit is missed (a `touch` re-triggers). Editing a template folder + restarting upgrades it in place, no delete-all churn. Seed reads the short blurb from `resources.json`'s **`short_description`** field → `Template.description`, and loads **`template_screenshot.png`** into the `Template.screenshot` binary column (that file is excluded from the shipped file-set). `update_template_from_project` uses the same `_upsert_template_content` helper. NOTE: seed never prunes — a renamed/removed slug leaves its old DB row (no orphan-delete yet).

**Template model additions** (`models.py`, migration `v13_template_official_screenshot`): `official: bool` (curated), `screenshot: bytes` (hero PNG), `content_checksum: str`. Endpoints: `GET /templates/{id}/screenshot` (image/png), `GET /templates/{id}/export` (streams the template files as a **zip = the deployable DAB bundle**), `PATCH /templates/{id}/official` (admin-only toggle), plus semantic search (`POST /templates/search`, pgvector over each template's embedded README, ILIKE fallback). `TemplateListItem`/`TemplateDetail` expose `official` + `has_screenshot` (list avoids loading the blob — one cheap `screenshot IS NOT NULL` query).

**Current set (7):** 6 AI/BI demos (`aibi-customer-support`, `-marketing-campaign`, `-portfolio-assistant`, `-supply-chain`, `-sales-pipeline`, `-patient-genomics`) + `aibi-app-luxebeauty-returns` (the full-stack flagship — app + Lakebase + SDP pipeline + ML + KA + MAS; sourced from `app/test/app_template_test/`). All deployed + DAB-deploy-tested on e2-demo-field-eng (into `dbdemos_templates.<slug>`).

**AI/BI demo shape** (each demo folder): `README.md`, `resources.json` (top-level `short_description` + `capabilities` + `created_resources` live IDs), `specifications/{01-lakeflow,04-ai-bi}.md` (full-PRD), `data_generation/generate_data.py` (**self-contained, plain `.py`** — folds the medallion SQL inline: raw via Spark → silver `saveAsTable`+NOT NULL+PK/FK RELY → gold enriched → metric view; reads `--catalog`/`--schema` args, ambient SparkSession on Databricks else Databricks Connect), `template_screenshot.png` (→ the `screenshot` column, not shipped as a file), `dashboard/dashboard.lvdash.json` (**datasets are schema-LESS bare table names** — the DAB `dataset_catalog`/`dataset_schema` or `lakeview create --dataset-catalog/--dataset-schema` inject the target, so ONE file works in any catalog/schema, dev or prod), `genie/genie_space.json` (**serialized-v2** format — `data_sources.tables` MUST be sorted by identifier), `src/deploy/deploy_genie.py`, `databricks.yml` (**`spark_python_task`** runs generate_data with `--catalog`/`--schema`; `notebook_task` for deploy_genie; `dashboards` resource with `dataset_catalog`/`dataset_schema` rebind), `dab_instructions.md`. The **luxebeauty** folder additionally has the full app (`app/`) + `src/{pipeline,ml,knowledge_assistant,supervisor_agent,metric_view,documents,deploy}` + a full multi-task setup-job DAB.

**What ships in a template (the seed/publish/fork payload).** `template_service.py::_should_include_in_template` is an **exclude-list** (was `.md`-only): it ships the whole deployable demo — narrative, specs, data-gen, dashboard/genie JSON, DAB, app source, **lockfiles** (deploy-required) — and rejects only junk (build outputs, `node_modules`/`.venv`/`.databricks`, `dist`/`build`, `.env*`, deploy-state markers, compiled/binary artifacts, **`template_screenshot.png`** — that goes to the `screenshot` column). The fork writer decompresses every stored `TemplateContent` back to the new project's disk verbatim, so a fork is deploy-ready. This gate covers all three paths: seed (`seed_templates.py`), user "publish project as template", and "update template".

**The gallery** — `ui/components/template/gallery/` (tile + slide-over + `use-gallery-filter`) is the shared UI powering the **`/templates`** page (in-app, `AppLayout`, admin approve/reject/delete/edit overlays): hero screenshot via `templateScreenshotUrl(id)`, `official` "Featured" treatment, industry filter + **semantic search box** (`searchTemplates` → `/templates/search`). The slide-over shows description + capabilities + an architecture preview, a **"Download DAB"** button (`exportTemplate` → the zip), and **"Use this template"** which opens a dialog: *use as is* vs *tune for your use case* (a textarea). The fork calls `createProjectFromTemplate(id, name, adaptInstructions?)`: with instructions → the new project opens with a **user** message asking the agent to review the cloned demo + apply the changes (`_build_adapt_prompt`); without → a friendly assistant greeting (`_build_fork_greeting`).

**Gotchas learned building/porting these (baked into the templates — keep them):** run `generate_data.py` with a **Python 3.12** interpreter (`app/.venv`) — Spark Connect `pandas_udf` needs the client's minor Python == serverless (3.11 fails). Validate live queries via the **CLI on a SQL warehouse** (`databricks experimental aitools tools query`), NOT Databricks Connect serverless (which has `AI_FORECAST` + some preview functions disabled). PK columns must be `NOT NULL` **before** `ADD PRIMARY KEY`; FK child/parent column **types must match** (cast at DataFrame build time — Delta can't `ALTER` INT→BIGINT in place). Genie `create_space`: tables sorted by identifier, title **no `/`** (use hyphen — the space title becomes a workspace item), and only ever trash a space by the exact `space_id` you created (never a title substring). Dashboard `:param` guards need NULL-safety (`size(NULL) = -1`, not 0): `:x IS NULL OR size(:x)=0 OR array_contains(...)`; and dashboard datasets ship **schema-less** (the DAB/`lakeview create` inject catalog/schema). **SDP SQL can't read a hardcoded volume path across catalogs** — use `read_files('/Volumes/${catalog}/${schema}/raw_data/...')` + a pipeline `configuration: {catalog, schema}` block so it works on any target (this bit the luxebeauty pipeline). Deploy-test a DAB with `-t dev` into a throwaway `<slug>_dabtest` schema.

### Observability (OpenTelemetry) — telemetry-gated, no-op when off

Enabling the Apps **Observability** option (UI + UC target tables) makes Databricks
inject the OTLP collector env (`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` + protocol/headers/attrs)
at runtime. `app/start.sh` detects that var and launches uvicorn under
**`opentelemetry-instrument`** (auto-instruments FastAPI request spans + logs);
otherwise it execs plain uvicorn — **byte-identical to before when telemetry is off**
(local dev, telemetry-disabled deploys). CPU/memory/process metrics are NOT
auto-wired for FastAPI, so `backend/core/observability.py::init_system_metrics()`
(called from `app.py`'s `_build_app`) explicitly starts `SystemMetricsInstrumentor`
when the OTLP endpoint is present. Deps live in `pyproject.toml` (the
`opentelemetry-*` block, incl. `-system-metrics` → pulls `psutil`). Only
`OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER=always_on` + `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` are set by us (in
`databricks.prod.yml` `app_env`); the endpoint/headers are Databricks-injected — never
hardcode them.

### ⚠️ Dev database: `RESET_DB` is DESTRUCTIVE — know the mode first

The dev DB mode is chosen in `backend/core/lakebase.py` `_is_pglite_mode()`: PGLite iff `USE_PGLITE=1` **or** `LAKEBASE_DATABASE_PATH` is unset. **Local dev normally sets `LAKEBASE_DATABASE_PATH` in `app/.env` → it points at a real remote Lakebase branch** (a named branch under the shared Lakebase project, NOT prod). So:

- **`RESET_DB=1` does NOT mean "wipe a throwaway local DB."** In Lakebase mode it **DROPS ALL TABLES on the remote branch** your `.env` points at (`lakebase.py:375`); in PGLite mode it deletes `~/.pglite/`. **Never run `RESET_DB=1` — or any test that sets it — against a branch holding real projects.** Point a test at a temp branch/DB instead.
- **Recovery:** Lakebase branches are copy-on-write with point-in-time restore. If a branch is damaged, create a recovery branch from a past timestamp (`databricks postgres create-branch … --json '{"spec":{"source_branch":"…/branches/<b>","source_branch_time":"<ISO ts>","no_expiry":true}}'`), verify the data, then repoint `.env` at it. On-disk `app/projects/<id>/` files survive a DB drop regardless — only the DB rows (project metadata, message history) are lost.

For the **test copies** (separate from the generator — see "Test apps ↔ skill" above):

```bash
cd app/test/app_template_test/app && ./start.sh   # Boots the FULL LuxeBeauty test app on :8765
cd app/test/luxebeauty_workshop && ./deploy.sh     # Gen raw data → UC Volume + upload workshop notebooks (WEST)
# app_template_test_simple is src-only (no runner) — sync its assets to references/example-luxebeauty-simple/
```

## Conventions

- **Python**: `uv` only, never `pip`. Use `claude-agent-sdk` (NOT the deprecated `Skill` tool name — pass `skills=` to the SDK).
- **Frontend**: `bun` (install/add). Path alias `@/` → `src/demo_prompt_generator/ui/`.
- **API routes** (generator): `response_model` + `operation_id` required (drives client codegen).
- **Models** (generator): 3-model pattern — `Entity` (SQLModel table) / `EntityIn` (Pydantic input) / `EntityOut` (Pydantic output).
- **Styling**: Tailwind v4, CSS custom properties (oklch). No CSS modules / styled-components.
- **Routing** (generator UI): TanStack Router file-based. Don't edit `routeTree.gen.ts`.
- **Template app stack**: Node + Express (`@databricks/appkit`) + React + Drizzle + OpenAI Agents SDK + mlflow-tracing. Different stack from the generator.
- **Logger** (template `server/lib/logger.ts`): `console.debug` is gated by `LOG_LEVEL` env (default INFO). Use it for per-request chatter; reserve `console.error` for actual failures.
- **Public mirror / internal-only content**: this repo (`databricks-field-eng/industry-demo-prompts`) is the PRIVATE source; `github.com/databricks-solutions/solution-builder` is the public mirror. Internal-only files live under clearly-`INTERNAL`-marked paths and are listed in **`.publicignore`** (repo root) — the private→public mirror job must exclude everything there. Current internal content: the three committed **deploy overlays** (`app/databricks.{prod,staging,prod-fevm}.yml` — real workspace/Lakebase IDs, endpoint names, admin emails; no secrets). (The former `/internal-demos` Demo-West catalog page was removed.)

## Operational rules (durable preferences)

- **Never deploy to prod without explicit ask.** Staging is fine.
- **Template Skeleton component**: use `<Skeleton className="… bg-muted" />` — appkit's default `bg-accent` reads as a brand teal in this theme, not a neutral placeholder.
- **Don't replicate the destination component's layout in a skeleton** — a few plain stacked bars read as a skeleton more clearly than column-matched scaffolding.
- **Show skeleton only on initial load.** Subsequent refetches (e.g. `dataMutated`) must swap data silently — flashing back to skeleton on every agent write is the bug, not the feature.

## How to keep this file accurate

This document is loaded into context at the start of every session. **It is your fastest path to being useful in the first 10 minutes.** Stale content makes you slower than no content. Update it when:

- A **top-level directory** is added or renamed (e.g. if `app/test/` is moved).
- A **stack swap** happens (e.g. dropping FastAPI for something else, swapping Tailwind, switching SDKs).
- A **workflow shift** happens (e.g. test-app ↔ template sync model changes).
- A **key file moves** (`agent.py`, `skills_manager.py`, `SKILL.md`).
- A **new dev/build/deploy script** is introduced or an existing one removed.
- A **durable preference** lands (those go under "Operational rules").

- A **new mode / packaging path** of a subsystem appears (e.g. the architecture skill's pure-vs-in-app split, a new render/feedback loop, a new way an artifact is generated or shipped).
- A **destructive-operation footgun** is discovered (like `RESET_DB` against a remote branch) — document the danger, not just the command.

Don't update for: in-flight feature work, bug fixes, refactors that don't move files. Memory entries under `~/.claude/projects/.../memory/` cover transient feedback.

**One CLAUDE.md, at the repo root.** There is deliberately no nested `app/CLAUDE.md` — a nested file only loads when you're working under that subtree, so facts would silently go missing. Everything (whole-system picture, app-dev patterns, dangers) lives in this one root file. Keep it that way: don't create per-directory CLAUDE.md files; add to the relevant section here instead.

When in doubt, **read this file again from disk before relying on it** — code drifts faster than memory.
