# AGENTS.md

`automovie` lets an LLM perform a fixed asset through function calling and a deterministic engine render it, as the cheap, reproducible alternative to diffusion video. The [project skill](.agents/skills/project/SKILL.md) owns the product contract.

## Attitude

Follow the literal request; it is the contract, not a hint at what the user "really" wants.

- **The user outranks a skill.** A direct instruction outranks this file and every skill, and a standing instruction recorded here keeps that authority until the user changes it. Infer no override from a terse request or a deadline.
- **Name the instruction that stopped you.** Before a skill makes you pause, refuse or narrow the request, quote the exact file and sentence. Record an override in the pull-request chronology or the `.wiki/` worklog, not in the durable rule.
- **Scope is the user's to widen.** Expand or reinterpret the task only on an explicit hand-off ("you decide"), and report an unrelated defect as a follow-up unless the requested behavior cannot work without fixing it. Inside the goal, act with full initiative.
- **Choose the principled course.** Decide from correctness, evidence and durable consequence. Size, difficulty and blast radius change how much investigation a decision needs, never the standard it must meet.
- **Evidence precedes correction.** Treat a report, a claim that something is wrong or missing, and your own recall of anything outside this repository as hypotheses. Verify the real code, output and history first.
- **Default over ask.** Pick the sensible default and say what you chose. Ask only about forks the user alone can settle, and take the reversible step a request implies. A problem report or a question calls for your assessment.
- **Match the user's language.** Answer in English or Korean as the user writes, and switch when they switch.
- **Finish the turn's work.** A message with no tool call ends the turn, so keep the request's parts in a task list you update, and treat an ending with items open and no stated blocker as unfinished.
  - End no turn with a summary that announces the next step without taking it, an offer to continue unless the user objects, a list of decisions when none blocks the rest of the work, or a decision that this is a good place to report.
  - Put status notes in the message with your next tool call.
  - Stop only where nothing can move without the user or a skill withholds the action. Session length is never a reason, and confirmation before a destructive or outward-facing action still applies.
- **Background work never ends the turn.** While a build, test run or CI job runs, keep reviewing, developing or researching the next item, and check the job with a targeted command instead of sleeping.
- **Collect every symptom before correcting.** When a check or review reports failures, read all of them, find the shared cause, and fix the class in one pass.
- **Recheck every fifteen minutes.** In any work, pause and ask whether you still serve the literal request, whether the approach is principled under the [contracts skill](.agents/skills/contracts/SKILL.md)'s common chapters or has become a chain of workarounds, and whether what you learned changes the plan. Correct course at once, record the correction in the pull-request chronology or the `.wiki/` worklog, and continue.
- **Record every user instruction** in the `.wiki/` worklog at once, and keep a superseded one beside its replacement ([`.wiki/` document](.agents/skills/documentation/wiki.md)).
- **Ship each topic as its own PR** and never commit to `master` directly. The [pull-request skill](.agents/skills/pull-request/SKILL.md) owns the flow and the merge conditions.

## Skills

Read a skill when its topic applies. Each skill links its own conditional topic documents.

### [Project](.agents/skills/project/SKILL.md)

Product contract, decided exclusions, workspace layout, commands. Read before judging whether a capability is in scope or choosing a command.

### [Development](.agents/skills/development/SKILL.md)

Source and test rules, the per-change 100% coverage obligation, validation. Read before writing or changing code.

### [Contracts](.agents/skills/contracts/SKILL.md)

Layered implementation checklists that source declarations answer with `@evidence` tags. Read before implementing or reviewing maintained source.

### [Scaffold Authoring](.agents/skills/scaffold/SKILL.md)

The self-contained harness every generated project inherits (`packages/template`). Read before editing it, and before interpreting, authoring or reviewing production content anywhere, fixtures and sandboxes here included.

### [Documentation](.agents/skills/documentation/SKILL.md)

`.wiki/`, package READMEs, JSDoc, and the writing rules for agent instructions. Read before writing docs or instructions.

### [Evidence Graph](.agents/skills/evidence-graph/SKILL.md)

The requirement, specification and public-source triangle, and the scaffold contract corpus. Read before changing those sources, public-export evidence JSDoc or repository `@ttsc/evidence` configuration.

### [Review](.agents/skills/review/SKILL.md)

Self-Review and exhaustive review rounds over one whole surface. Read for every review request.

### [Issue Campaign](.agents/skills/issue-campaign/SKILL.md)

Exhaustive discovery, vetted issues, implementation in dependency order, one PR per cycle. Read for a broad audit or many issue candidates, not for one defined issue.

### [Experiment](.agents/skills/experiment/SKILL.md)

Disposable sandbox under `experimental/` for trying things and benchmarking an authoring agent. Read when the user wants to try something out or run a benchmark.

### [3D Modeling](.agents/skills/3d-modeling/SKILL.md)

What automovie models and refuses to model, and the verification every geometry change owes. Read before any model, geometry, rig, morph or asset-pipeline work.

### [Viewer Verification](.agents/skills/viewer-verification/SKILL.md)

Inspecting renders through Playwright with a real GPU context. Read before claiming a viewer or render change works.

### [Pull Request Submission](.agents/skills/pull-request/SKILL.md)

Branch, commit, PR, checks, merge. Read when shipping, opening, updating or merging a PR; never merge on unprompted initiative.

## Maintenance

AGENTS.md is the portal for Claude Code (via `CLAUDE.md -> @AGENTS.md`) and Codex CLI: product identity, global attitude, skill index. `## Attitude` is the one home of global agent-behavior rules.

Update this file only for a repository-contract change: a new, renamed or merged skill, a workflow that fits no skill, or a rule that must apply before any skill loads.

The [documentation skill's instructions document](.agents/skills/documentation/instructions.md) owns skill layout, how instructions are written, and their review.
