# AGENTS.md

Guide for AI coding agents (and humans) working in this repo. `CLAUDE.md` is a
symlink to this file.

## What this is

**rdyrct**: an organization-based link shortener + QR generator that runs
entirely on **Cloudflare**: one Worker serves the API, the short-link redirects,
and the static SPA. Source of truth is **D1** (SQLite); the slug→destination hot
path is **KV**; custom domains use **Cloudflare for SaaS**. Product host:
`rdyrct.com`. Public repo: `github.com/baronunread/rdyrct`.

## Tooling: use bun

Always use **bun**, never npm/npx.

```sh
bun install
bun run dev                 # vite dev (Worker + SPA) on :5173
bunx emulate --service resend   # local Resend inbox on :4000 (read: curl :4000/emails -H 'authorization: Bearer test_token_admin')
bun run db:migrate:local    # apply migrations to local D1
bun run db:reset:local      # wipe local D1 + KV, re-apply migrations (start from scratch; restart dev after)
bun add <pkg>               # dependencies
bunx agent-browser          # real-browser checks: screenshots, clicking through pages. Use it for any visual verification; do not hand-roll headless Chrome
bun scripts/seed-local.ts   # seed local D1/KV with fake data (run dev server first)
```

**Local Cloudflare state**: while `bun run dev` runs, the Explorer API at
`http://localhost:5173/cdn-cgi/explorer/api` exposes the local KV, R2, D1,
Durable Objects, and Workflows. Fetch that URL for the OpenAPI schema, then use
it to list, query, and manage local resources (e.g. inspect D1 rows or KV keys
without wrangler CLI calls).

**Two TypeScript projects; run BOTH after changes:**

```sh
bun run check                          # app + shared (tsconfig.json → src/app, src/shared)
bunx tsc -p tsconfig.worker.json --noEmit   # worker (src/worker)
bun run test                           # unit tests (bun test, tests/)
bun run doctor                         # react-doctor audit (React health score; --verbose for details)
bun run fallow                         # fallow codebase intelligence audit
```

react-doctor runs in CI through `.github/workflows/react-doctor.yml` (advisory,
PRs + main). Run fallow locally when auditing codebase health; track its
findings in issues rather than blocking CI.

react-doctor also runs as a pre-commit hook on staged files (`--blocking warning`).
react-doctor skill lives in `.agents/skills/react-doctor` and `.claude/skills/react-doctor`.
fallow skill lives in `.claude/skills/fallow`.

Shell writes to repo files are sandboxed; edit through the editor tools, not
`sed`/`perl` (or run bash with the sandbox disabled for scripted edits).

## Architecture

- **Worker** (`src/worker/index.ts`): custom-domain redirect middleware →
  BetterAuth at `/api/auth/*` → Polar webhook `/api/webhooks/polar` → API router
  (`/api/*`, behind `withSession`) → root `/:slug` redirect → SPA asset fallback.
- **Routing has NO `/app` prefix.** `/` is the marketing landing. Public routes:
  `/login`, `/signup`, `/privacy`, `/terms`, `/reset-password`,
  `/invite/:token`. The app lives at root keywords: `/dashboard` (quick link
  creation, quick stats, recent activity), `/analytics` (the full stats page), `/links`,
  `/domains`, `/members`, `/billing`, `/settings`, `/admin`. There is **no org id
  in URLs**: the current org is a localStorage-backed store, `useCurrentOrg`
  (`src/app/lib/current-org.ts`). Those keywords are reserved from custom slugs
  via `RESERVED_SLUGS` in `src/worker/util.ts` (the Worker also guards `/:slug`).
- **Billing is per-user, not per-org.** `user.plan` (`free`|`hobby`|`pro`) +
  Polar customer/subscription ids live on the user; each Polar product maps to
  a plan via `POLAR_*_PRODUCT_ID`. An org's effective limits are **its
  owner's plan**: `orgPlan()` in `src/worker/plan.ts` resolves the owner. Only
  Pro raises the owned-org cap above 1. Caps: `PLAN_LIMITS` in
  `src/shared/types.ts` (`{ orgs, links, members, domains, qr,
analyticsDays }`). Slugs on the **shared** domain are always random (every
  plan); chosen slugs exist only on custom domains, so the shared namespace
  can't be squatted. New users get **no default org**: there is no onboarding
  route; org-scoped pages render `NoOrgState`
  (`src/app/components/no-org.tsx`) until they create one, and `/billing`
  works org-less, so landing paid CTAs (`/signup?next=/billing?plan=…`) can
  check out before the first org exists (`/onboarding` redirects to
  `/dashboard`).
- **Auth**: BetterAuth (email+password, `requireEmailVerification` via the
  `emailOTP` plugin, 6-digit code; password reset stays a link). PBKDF2/WebCrypto
  hashing (`src/worker/password.ts`). The account matching the `SUPERADMIN_EMAIL`
  secret is the platform admin; admin routes **404** (not 403) for everyone else.
  Platform admins can **ban** users (`user.banned`): banning wipes their sessions
  and `databaseHooks.session.create.before` (in `better-auth.ts`) refuses new
  ones, while their orgs/links keep working.
  Self-service account deletion is blocked while the user still owns an org.
- **KV keys**: `slug:{slug}` (shared host), `slug:{host}:{slug}` (custom domain),
  `domain:{host}`. D1 is authoritative; KV is the redirect hot path. Clicks are
  recorded via `waitUntil` after the redirect is sent, and store only
  country/referrer/device/timestamp, **never an IP address**.
- **QR logos live in R2** (binding `QR_LOGOS`, bucket `rdyrct-qr-logos`), keyed
  `{orgId}/{fileId}.{ext}`. The `qr_logo` columns store only the serving URL
  (`/api/orgs/<orgId>/qr-logo/<file>`), never image bytes. Upload and serving
  are the same org-scoped route (`POST`/`GET /api/orgs/:orgId/qr-logo[/:file]`),
  gated to org members: only the signed-in app ever fetches a logo (QR
  previews/downloads bake the image in client-side), and a row may only
  reference its own org's logos. Paid plans, ≤ 2 MB =
  `QR_LOGO_MAX_BYTES` in `src/shared/types.ts`. Serving is immutable and
  `private`-cached. Deletes follow the row: replace/clear/delete on
  links and orgs removes the object; org teardown wipes the `{orgId}/` prefix
  (`src/worker/storage.ts`).

## Conventions

- **Errors go to toasts** (`useToast`), never inline red field text.
- UI kit in `src/app/ui/`: Button (`primary|outline|ghost`, has `size`),
  Field/Input/Select, Dialog, Badge, Card/PageHeader/Table, Menu,
  Tooltip, toast, Skeleton (`ui/skeleton.tsx`; page-level skeletons that
  mirror each route's layout live in `src/app/components/skeletons.tsx`; use
  those instead of a spinner for page loading states), Spinner
  (`ui/spinner.tsx`; use it for in-flight buttons, never a `…` label).
  Design tokens: `bg`/`surface`/`surface-2`/`border`/`muted`/
  `text`/`accent`/`danger`. JetBrains Mono, theme-aware (light + dark).
- Data layer: `api()` + `ApiError` (`.status`, `.code`) in `src/app/lib/api.ts`;
  TanStack Query hooks in `src/app/lib/hooks.ts`.
- **Strict CSP** on published pages, everything self-contained: no remote fonts,
  images, scripts, or fetches. Icons via `lucide-react`; art via inline CSS/SVG.
- Email: `sendEmail()` (`src/worker/email.ts`) uses the Resend HTTP API via plain
  `fetch`, with `RESEND_BASE_URL` pointing at the emulator in dev. Keep it: the
  Resend SDK can't repoint its base URL, which would break the emulator flow.

## Writing copy

All user-facing copy (and this file) follows Orwell's six rules from
"Politics and the English Language":

1. Never use a metaphor, simile, or other figure of speech which you are used
   to seeing in print.
2. Never use a long word where a short one will do.
3. If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out.
4. Never use the passive where you can use the active.
5. Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word, or a jargon word if you can
   think of an everyday English equivalent.
6. Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous.

House rules on top of Orwell:

- **No em dashes.** Use a period, comma, colon, or parentheses instead.
- Say **"paid"** when a feature comes with any paid plan (Hobby or Pro);
  name **"Pro"** only for the things only Pro has (extra orgs, more domains).

## Config

Secrets live on the worker (set all at once with
`bunx wrangler secret bulk prod.secrets.env`, see `prod.secrets.env.example`)
and vars live in `wrangler.jsonc`; local dev reads everything from `.dev.vars`
(see `.dev.vars.example`). Key names:
`BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`, `SUPERADMIN_EMAIL`, `RESEND_API_KEY`, `MAIL_FROM`,
`APP_URL`, `APP_HOST`, `POLAR_ACCESS_TOKEN`/`POLAR_WEBHOOK_SECRET`/
`POLAR_PRO_PRODUCT_ID`/`POLAR_HOBBY_PRODUCT_ID`, `CF_API_TOKEN`/`CF_ZONE_ID`,
`DEV_FAKE_CF`, `BETTERSTACK_SOURCE_TOKEN`/`BETTERSTACK_INGEST_URL`.
