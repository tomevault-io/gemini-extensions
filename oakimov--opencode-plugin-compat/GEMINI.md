# AGENTS.md — opencode-plugin-compat

## Product

Universal **OCP** compatibility **bridge** monorepo. The stack is complete and published — no phased MVP cuts.

- Goal: **any OpenCode plugin runs unchanged** on cooperating hosts.
- OCP is an **external compatibility layer** for MiMo/Kilo/OpenCode, the Pi family, and DeepSeek Harness — hosts are read-only references; all OCP work lives in this repo.

### Non-negotiable vendor boundary

OCP is a plugin compatibility layer. **Patching a host shipped by another vendor defeats the product and is not an implementation option.**

- **Never propose, plan, attempt, or make a change to a host checkout, host package, installed host binary, or vendor source as part of OCP work.** Do not treat a vendor patch as a fallback, experiment, diagnostic shortcut, prerequisite, or possible solution. This prohibition applies even when a host source checkout is available locally and even when changing it would be technically easy.
- MiMo, Kilo, OpenCode, pi, omp, and deepseek-harness source trees are **read-only evidence only**: use them to understand contracts and runtime behavior. No OCP task may leave modifications in those repositories.
- **Every compatibility fix must live entirely in OCP** and work against the stock installed host through public or host-injected extension/runtime seams. For Pi-family hosts, use `pi-bridge`, `ExtensionAPI`, `ExtensionAPI.pi`, live objects intentionally exposed through that runtime, extension UI, and advertised tools. For DSH, use `dsh-bridge`, Cordis `LlmAdapter` / `ctx.llm.registerAdapter`, `ctx.credentials`, and `cordis.patch.yml`.
- Private host internals may be inspected to understand behavior, but they are not an implementation surface. If the installed host's extension/runtime seams cannot express the required behavior, stop and report a concrete compatibility limitation. Do not cross the vendor boundary to make the limitation disappear.
- Before designing a fix, inspect the actual executable, resolved package, plugin symlink/install tree, and loaded `dist` entry used by the reproduction. A nearby host checkout is never presumed to be loaded and never becomes a writable dependency of the solution.
- **Interactive behavior requires an interactive acceptance test.** Unit/type tests are supporting checks, not proof. For mode switches, approval dialogs, plan review, or execution handoffs, rebuild/install OCP and the consumer provider, start the real stock host in a TTY, drive the complete user flow, and verify the host transcript, side effect, and absence of retries before saying the issue is fixed.
- These rules apply to the main agent and every delegated subagent. Prompts to subagents must identify host repositories as read-only and forbid edits there.

### Non-negotiable OCP / consumer-provider boundary

The dependency direction is one-way: **OCP may know consumer providers; consumer providers must not know OCP.** OCP must adapt published providers without requiring OCP imports, host branches, or fork vocabulary in their source.

- **Provider stays unchanged:** never solve compatibility by adding `@opencode-compat/*`, OCP detection, fork environment variables, alternate tool names, or host-specific schemas to a consumer provider. Provider-side structural capability contracts must be host-neutral; OCP installs them before provider load.
- **Generic core, optional integrations:** generic facade, adapter, loader, config, and stream translation code must work for arbitrary OpenCode/AI-SDK providers. A provider-specific integration (currently Cursor host tools) must live in a clearly named optional module, activate only for an explicit package match, fail open when that provider is absent, and never become a prerequisite for generic providers.
- **OCP owns translation end-to-end:** fork paths, canonical tool catalog translation, call inputs, results, prompt/history replay, opaque resume ids, schemas, MCP/resource vocabulary, agents, and mode semantics are OCP responsibilities. The provider must see canonical OpenCode shapes.
- **No translation residue in providers:** if OCP normalizes an alternate host tool, schema, result envelope, approval outcome, or history record, remove the corresponding host parser and identity from the consumer provider in the same change. Never preserve provider-side fallbacks “just in case”; that recreates two contracts and makes the provider host-aware. Add provider architecture tests before considering relocation complete.
- **Provider identities stop at OCP:** provider-specific OCP behavior must be selected by an explicit package match and live in a clearly named optional module. Generic adapters receive only neutral callbacks/data and must not contain `cursorIntegration`, Devin branches, provider package imports, or sibling-provider schemas. Consumer providers must never export aliases for one another.
- **OpenCode is native — never ocp-dev shim it.** Stock OpenCode (1.x and 2.0) loads consumer plugins through its own plugin surface. Point its `plugin` / provider entry at the published package or the provider checkout `dist/`. `./scripts/ocp-dev.sh run` must not wrap OpenCode, rewrite its config, or install a `~/.cache/ocp-dev/opencode` wrapper. Local-dev shims are for hosts that are *not* OpenCode: MiMo, Kilo, pi, omp, and dsh. Named `run opencode` is an error; default `run` with no host names skips it.
- **Three host families, three mechanisms — never unify them:**
  - **OpenCode clones** (MiMo, Kilo; zcode detect-only) ship OpenCode-shaped native plugin packages → facades + **one** autodetection adapter + host kit, wired by `ocp setup`. `packages/adapter` must not contain Pi/OMP/DSH ids, paths, env variables, packages, or tool roles.
  - **Pi family** (`pi` earendil-works, `oh-my-pi`/omp can1357) are **not** OpenCode forks and have no `@opencode-ai/plugin`-shaped package → `@opencode-compat/pi-bridge` dynamically loads the unmodified plugin and registers it via the host's own `pi.registerProvider(...)`, translating AI-SDK `doStream` ↔ the host's event stream. The `ocp` CLI and clone adapter are not involved.
  - **DSH family** (`dsh` / DeepSeek Harness) is **not** an OpenCode fork and not Pi → `@opencode-compat/dsh-bridge` is a Cordis plugin that registers `ctx.llm.registerAdapter(...)`, translating AI-SDK `doStream` ↔ DSH `StreamChunk`. The `ocp` CLI and clone adapter are not involved. `packages/adapter` must not contain DSH ids.
- **Neutral path contract:** install `Symbol.for("opencode.host.path-bridge")` with structural cache/data/config/project paths. Legacy symbols may be emitted only as time-bounded backward compatibility; new provider code must not import OCP or name the installer. Generic bridge paths and cache namespaces must not be named after Cursor or another consumer.
- **Capability/catalog integrity:** preserve every enabled tool and the cacheable prefix through translation. Sort the **first nonempty catalog once** by canonical name in UTF-16 code-unit order; never re-sort that established prefix. When new names appear, sort only that newcomer batch and append it at the tail (so initial `z`, then newly discovered `a`, remains `z, a`). Keep equal-name descriptors and order frozen, and never embed live host state (for example agent rosters) in descriptions or schemas. A lifecycle call with no tools remains a lifecycle signal; session affinity and cancellation must reach the downstream provider so it can correlate a sibling full-catalog call. Never invent/filter a catalog to accommodate one provider.
- **Functionality relocation gate:** before removing a compatibility branch from a consumer provider, add OCP tests proving equivalent catalog, call, result, resume-id, schema, and prompt-history behavior. Refactoring the boundary must not delete working compatibility.
- **Architecture checks:** tests must cover at least one generic fake/Acme provider on clone and Pi paths, explicit optional Cursor activation, no Pi/DSH logic in clone runtime, no mandatory/static Cursor import in generic Pi or DSH code, and no Pi logic in `packages/dsh-bridge` clone-facing runtime (DSH must not import Pi host packages).

Plugins are discovered through **OpenCode's own standard conventions** (`hooks.auth`, the `config` hook's `provider[id].models`, the root `createXxx()` AI-SDK factory). Never hardcode a specific plugin in generic bridge code and never sniff host versions to pick behavior.
- **User delivery UX (locked):** one installable umbrella package (`@opencode-compat/ocp`) + **`ocp setup`** that writes install-tree overrides; users then add **consumer** plugins via host config (`plugin` / equivalent) unchanged. Listing OCP itself in `plugin` is optional bootstrap only — it does **not** intercept other plugins’ imports by itself.
- Facades remapped in **plugin install trees / operator overrides** (not spoofing public `@opencode-ai` on npm). Publish **public** `@opencode-compat/*` — agent bump/publish runbook in this file; human guide `docs/guides/npm-publish.md`.
- Scope: `@opencode-compat/*` — **host bridge packages** (internal) + umbrella UX package + named **companions** that must not redefine OCP success.
- License: **MPL-2.0** (all packages).
- ZCode is **T0 only** for OCP (marketplace ≠ OpenCode plugin ABI). Companion `@opencode-compat/migrate-zcode` migrates **plugin-packaged** skills/commands/marketplace manifests into `.zcode-plugin` trees (**not** host MCP; **not** unchanged `@opencode-ai/plugin` loadability).
- **Do not** create or plan host-specific forks of consumer plugins (no `cursor-mimocode-provider`, `cursor-kilocode-provider`, ZCode variants, etc.). Close gaps in the bridge.
- **Do not** ship separate per-host adapter packages. Host differences are `HostProfile` data + dispatch inside `@opencode-compat/adapter`.

## Layout

packages/ocp          # umbrella UX (+ ocp setup) — OpenCode clones
packages/profile|facade-*|adapter|host-promise-v2|cli|migrate-zcode
packages/opencode-loader  # shared OpenCode plugin loader (pi-bridge + dsh-bridge)
packages/pi-bridge    # Pi family (pi / omp) — dynamic OpenCode-plugin loader
packages/dsh-bridge   # DSH family — Cordis LlmAdapter
fixtures/          # OCP conformance (migrator tests use in-memory mocks)
docs/hosts/        # ONE self-contained page per host family (install + internals)
docs/ocp/0.1.md    # contract (OpenCode-clone facade protocol)

docs/guides/       # companion privacy / ZCode import notes (non-OCP runtime)
```

## Build rules

- Prefer Bun workspaces; TypeScript strict; ESM only.
- Facades / universal adapter must not hardcode a single fork’s XDG paths — use `HostProfile` + autodetection.
- MiMo extension hooks (`actor.*`, `session.*`) are **non-portable** — never require them for T1 plugins.
- Facade `v2/effect` may loud-fail unless host declares capability; `v2/promise` + aisdk is the T3 bar.
- Do not claim ZCode drop-in without a Z.AI vendor loader.
- `pi-bridge` host variance is data in `packages/pi-bridge/src/host/profile.ts` (`PiHostProfile`) + narrow dispatch — same rule as `HostProfile`; never fork the package per host. Optional host packages (`@oh-my-pi/pi-ai`, `@earendil-works/pi-ai`) must stay **lazy dynamic imports**; a top-level import breaks the other host and the test run.
- `dsh-bridge` host variance is data in `packages/dsh-bridge/src/host/profile.ts` (`DshHostProfile`) + narrow dispatch. Optional DSH packages (`@deepseek-ai/schemastery`, `@deepseek-ai/dsh-llm`) must stay **lazy / structural**; a top-level import breaks pack and hosts that are not DSH.
- Consumer plugins (e.g. `cursor-opencode-provider`) are **test/matrix subjects**, not deliverables of this repo.
- Privacy companions: Kilo/MiMo document **in-app** telemetry opt-out; ZCode telemetry is **docs-only** firewall/DNS — never claim an OCP plugin kill.

## Docs source of truth

1. `docs/ocp/0.1.md` — protocol contract for the OpenCode-clone facade path
2. `packages/pi-bridge/README.md` — contract + config reference for the Pi family
3. `packages/dsh-bridge/README.md` — contract + Cordis patch config for the DSH family
4. `docs/hosts/opencode-clones.md` (MiMo/Kilo/ZCode) / `docs/hosts/pi-family.md` (Pi) / `docs/hosts/dsh-family.md` (DSH) — one self-contained guide per host family; install lives **in** them, not in a separate top-level INSTALL doc
5. Provider-maintained interactive acceptance checklist: `cursor-opencode-provider/docs/host-compat-acceptance.md`; run the OMP/Pi/DSH items against stock hosts before claiming interactive parity.
6. `docs/plans/**` — **historical**; shipped work, kept for provenance. Superseded by the above wherever they disagree; do not treat as a roadmap.

## Version bump / publish (agent runbook)

When the user asks to **bump the version** (e.g. “bump to 0.1.3”), treat that as a **full release request** and run this checklist **end-to-end without stopping for confirmation**, unless a gate fails or the target version already exists on npm.

Canonical human guide: `docs/guides/npm-publish.md`. This section is the agent execution contract.

### Hard rules

- Ship the **whole train** together — all 11 `@opencode-compat/*` packages share one version.
- Packages are **public** (`publishConfig.access: "public"` / `--access public`). Never private.
- **Never** republish an existing version. If `npm view @opencode-compat/ocp@X.Y.Z version` already returns that version, stop and ask.
- **Never** bump by hand-editing only `package.json`. Always use `bun scripts/bump-version.ts <ver>` so **`bun.lock` workspace versions** stay in sync.
- Bun `pm pack` rewrites `workspace:*` from **`bun.lock`**, not `package.json`. A stale lock publishes wrong transitive pins (this is how `0.1.1` broke). `pack:check` must pass before commit/tag.
- **`pi-bridge` / `dsh-bridge` `@opencode-compat/*` deps must be exact train pins, never `workspace:*`.** Those packages are installed into foreign package managers via `file:` (`dsh plugin add file:…`, `pi install <checkout>`). Profile pnpm cannot see this Bun workspace — `workspace:*` fails with `ERR_PNPM_WORKSPACE_PKG_NOT_FOUND` (0.4.1 regression). `bump-version.ts` rewrites the exact pins and refuses workspace protocol on those packages; `pack:check` / publish assert the same.
- Do **not** use local `bun run publish:npm` for later releases — Trusted Publishers + OIDC on tag `v*` is the path.
- Tag format is **`v` + train version** (example: packages `0.1.2` → tag `v0.1.2`). Tag must match package versions.
- Root `package.json` version is monorepo metadata and may lag; do **not** require it to match the train.

### Packages in the train

`profile` → `opencode-loader` → `host-promise-v2` → `migrate-zcode` → `adapter` → `facade-sdk` → `facade-plugin` → `cli` → `ocp` → `pi-bridge` → `dsh-bridge`

This order is `PACKAGES` in `scripts/publish.ts` — keep the two in sync when adding a package.

### Automatic steps (do all of these)

1. **Preflight**
   - `git status` clean (or only intentional release edits); on `main`; pull/pushable.
   - Confirm target version is **new**: `npm view @opencode-compat/ocp@X.Y.Z version` must fail / not equal target.
   - Confirm current train is consistent: all `packages/*/package.json` versions equal; `bun.lock` workspace versions equal that train.
   - Optional sanity: last Publish workflow succeeded (`gh run list --workflow=publish.yml -L 3`).

2. **Bump**
   ```bash
   bun scripts/bump-version.ts X.Y.Z
   ```
   This updates each package `package.json`, `VERSION` / profile `OCP_VERSION` (`packages/profile/src/version.ts`), and **`bun.lock`**, then runs `bun install`.

   **Do not** convert `pi-bridge` / `dsh-bridge` `@opencode-compat/*` deps to `workspace:*` before or after the bump. Those packages must keep **exact train pins**; the script rewrites them (`0.4.1` → `X.Y.Z`) and exits non-zero if it finds `workspace:*` on them — **before any files are written**. Expect:
   ```
     @opencode-compat/pi-bridge dependencies.@opencode-compat/opencode-loader: … → X.Y.Z
     @opencode-compat/dsh-bridge dependencies.@opencode-compat/opencode-loader: … → X.Y.Z
   foreign-file-pins-ok: pi-bridge, dsh-bridge @opencode-compat/* → X.Y.Z
   ```
   Spot-check: `rg '"@opencode-compat/opencode-loader"' packages/pi-bridge/package.json packages/dsh-bridge/package.json` must show `"X.Y.Z"`, never `workspace:*`.

3. **Docs / defaults sync**
   - CLI setup default is `OCP_VERSION` from `@opencode-compat/profile` — no hardcoded train pin needed in `setup.ts`.
   - Update user-facing train mentions in `docs/hosts/opencode-clones.md` §2.4 (example `--version` / “today **X.Y.Z**”) when they still name an older train.
   - Do **not** churn historical narrative in `docs/guides/npm-publish.md` bootstrap sections, plan docs, or host-profile `drafts.ts` `ocpVersion` contract examples unless the user asks.

4. **Verify (fail closed)**
   ```bash
   bun run pack:check
   ```
   Must show:
    - `publish-ready: 11 public packages @ X.Y.Z`
    - `foreign-file-pins-ok: pi-bridge, dsh-bridge @opencode-compat/* → X.Y.Z`
    - eleven packs at `X.Y.Z`
    - `packed-deps-ok: 11 tarballs pin @opencode-compat/* @ X.Y.Z`
   Spot-check tarballs under `.tmp/npm-pack/` if anything looks off: every `@opencode-compat/*` dependency must be the **exact** train version.

5. **Commit + push `main`**
   ```bash
   git add -A
   git commit -m "chore: release X.Y.Z"
   git push origin main
   ```
   Include `bun.lock` and any INSTALL/default sync files.

6. **Tag + push tag (triggers OIDC publish)**
   ```bash
   git tag vX.Y.Z
   git push origin vX.Y.Z
   ```
   `.github/workflows/publish.yml` runs on `v*` → install → typecheck → test → build → `bun scripts/publish.ts --publish --oidc --skip-tests`.

7. **Verify publish**
   - Watch the run: `gh run watch` / `gh run list --workflow=publish.yml -L 1` until success.
    - Confirm registry for all 11 (or at least umbrella + leaves):
     ```bash
     npm view @opencode-compat/ocp version          # X.Y.Z
     npm view @opencode-compat/ocp@X.Y.Z dependencies
     ```
     Transitive `@opencode-compat/*` deps on the published umbrella must be **X.Y.Z**, not an older train.
   - `npm dist-tag ls @opencode-compat/ocp` → `latest` should be `X.Y.Z`.
   - Consumer smoke (when host caches are available):
     ```bash
     bun add -g @opencode-compat/ocp@X.Y.Z
     ocp setup --host mimo --mode npm --version X.Y.Z
     ocp setup --host kilo --mode npm --version X.Y.Z
     ocp doctor --host mimo
     ```

### If something fails

- **`pack:check` / packed-deps gate:** fix lock/train drift (`bun scripts/bump-version.ts X.Y.Z` or repair `bun.lock`); do not tag.
- **`foreign-file-pins-ok` / `Foreign file-install pin gate failed`:** someone put `workspace:*` on `pi-bridge` or `dsh-bridge`. Restore exact train pins (`"@opencode-compat/opencode-loader": "X.Y.Z"`), re-run `bun scripts/bump-version.ts X.Y.Z`, then `pack:check`. `bump-version` refuses **before writing** when it sees workspace protocol on those packages. Do not “fix” it by converting other packages the other way.
- **Publish workflow OIDC / ENEEDAUTH:** check Trusted Publisher settings (repo `oakimov/opencode-plugin-compat`, workflow filename exactly `publish.yml`) and `repository.url` in each package; do not fall back to a long-lived `NPM_TOKEN` unless the user explicitly asks.
- **Partial train on npm (should not happen via OIDC, but if recovering a local publish):** `bun scripts/publish.ts --publish --skip-existing` — only with user intent.
- **Bad version already on registry:** you cannot fix-in-place. Deprecate if needed (`npm deprecate pkg@ver "reason"`), bump to the **next** patch, and ship a good train. Do not rely on `npm unpublish` for patched mistakes.

### Intentionally out of scope unless asked

- Retagging `latest` onto an older version.
- Deprecating prior trains.
- Live MiMo/Kilo model listing beyond setup/doctor smoke.
- Bumping root private workspace `package.json` version.

## Standing constraints

- **ZCode stays T0.** `migrate-zcode` packs plugin-packaged skills/commands/manifests into `.zcode-plugin` trees; it never packs host MCP and never makes ZCode an `@opencode-ai/plugin` load target.
- **Expand `facade-sdk` from real smoke failures**, not speculation; keep the conformance matrix green.
- **`host-promise-v2` is wired from the OCP layer** wherever provider-resolve is reachable without modifying host source. Live clone hosts still need an operator/sidecar call into `resolveProvider` for T3.
- **Consumer plugins** (e.g. `cursor-opencode-provider`) are test/matrix subjects, not deliverables of this repo. Gaps close in the bridge, never by forking the plugin. OpenCode loads those plugins natively; do not route live OpenCode through an ocp-dev wrapper.
- **Releases** follow **Version bump / publish** above (OIDC on `v*`). First-time bootstrap details stay in `docs/guides/npm-publish.md`.

Companion privacy guides live under `docs/guides/` (Kilo/MiMo in-app opt-out; ZCode docs-only firewall/DNS). Doctor prints one-liner pointers; OCP never mutates telemetry.
