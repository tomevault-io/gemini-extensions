## What This Project Is

MetalSharp is a macOS app that runs Windows Steam games and Windows programs via Wine + Metal translation. It's an Electron app with a Rust HTTP backend, a C++ native D3D/Metal engine, per-game engine routing, runtime bottles, installer profiles, and Linux `.deb` packaging.

## Key Concepts

### MTSP Routing and Runtime Bottles

Modern runtime paths use MTSP pipeline ids and bottle profiles. Steam games get `steam_<appid>` bottles that are launch-authoritative for runtime checks. Wine Steam remains the live background Steam client; env-dependent Steam routes launch the game executable directly with the bottle prefix, route env, and Steam identity variables instead of trying to make an already-running Steam process inherit new env.

| Public route | Method | Example games |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| `M9` | D3D9 / 32-bit capable DXMT-family route | Nidhogg 2, Undertale, Blasphemous, Dave the Diver |
| `M10` | D3D10 to Metal | D3D10 apps/games |
| `M11` | D3D11 to Metal | Rain World, Schedule I, Subnautica BZ |
| `M12` | D3D12 to Metal through the isolated `dxmt-m12` runtime surface | Peak, Silksong, Elden Ring, D3D12 investigation titles |
| `Mono/FNA` | Windows XNA/FNA through native Mono, staged FNA/XNA assemblies, and host shims | Celeste, Terraria |

Internal route ids such as `dxmt`, `wine_bare`, `m32`, `steam`, `macos_steam`, and `m13` stay backend-parseable for legacy records, diagnostics, and fallback behavior, but they are not normal bottle route buttons.

### Key Paths at Runtime

- Wine runtime: `~/.metalsharp/runtime/wine/`
- Wine prefix: `~/.metalsharp/prefix-steam/`
- DXMT PE DLLs for M9/M10/M11: `~/.metalsharp/runtime/wine/lib/dxmt/x86_64-windows/`
- DXMT M12 PE DLLs: `~/.metalsharp/runtime/wine/lib/dxmt-m12/x86_64-windows/`
- DXMT M12 Unix bridge and sidecars: `~/.metalsharp/runtime/wine/lib/dxmt-m12/x86_64-unix/`
- DXVK i386 DLLs: `~/.metalsharp/runtime/wine/lib/dxvk/i386-windows/`
- MoltenVK ICD: `~/.metalsharp/runtime/wine/etc/vulkan/icd.d/MoltenVK_icd.json`
- DXMT config: `~/.metalsharp/runtime/wine/etc/dxmt.conf`
- Local redistributables: `~/.metalsharp/runtime/redist/`
- Runtime bottles: `~/.metalsharp/bottles/<bottle_id>/`
- Bottle prefix: `~/.metalsharp/bottles/<bottle_id>/prefix/`
- Bottle manifest: `~/.metalsharp/bottles/<bottle_id>/bottle.json`
- Bottle logs: `~/.metalsharp/bottles/<bottle_id>/logs/`
- Shader cache: `~/.metalsharp/shader-cache/<engine>/<appid>/`
- Game local copies: `~/.metalsharp/games/<appid>/`
- Logs: `~/.metalsharp/logs/`

### HTTP API (main.rs)

Backend listens on `127.0.0.1:9274` (override with `METALSHARP_PORT`). Key endpoints:

- `POST /game/launch-auto` — launch game by appid with engine auto-detection
- `POST /game/prepare` — prepare game runtime (shims, DLLs, config)
- `GET /steam/library` — full game library (owned + installed)
- `POST /steam/launch` — start Wine Steam
- `POST /steam/stop` — kill Wine Steam, wineserver, Wine Steam service helpers, detached Wine desktop/tray helpers, and headless Wine console hosts
- `POST /steam/launch-game` — Steam game launch with bottle preflight; env-dependent routes keep Wine Steam alive and spawn the game through the selected MTSP pipeline
- `POST /steam/runtime-doctor` — inspect a Steam game's bottle/runtime readiness
- `GET /sharp-library` — Sharp Library apps and imported Windows programs
- `POST /sharp-library/install` — Install Windows Program flow for EXE/MSI/installer bottles
- `POST /sharp-library/import-bottle-app` — import detected app candidates from a bottle
- `GET /bottles` — list runtime bottles
- `GET /bottles/profiles` — list supported bottle runtime profiles
- `GET /bottles/compatibility-matrix` — bottle compatibility cases
- `GET /bottles/redist-sources` — local redistributable source status
- `POST /bottles/doctor` — diagnose bottle readiness
- `POST /bottles/prepare` — prepare runtime assets/components for a bottle
- `POST /bottles/repair-component` — repair missing runtime components
- `POST /bottles/set-runtime-profile` — change a bottle profile
- `POST /bottles/set-windows-version` — apply a Wine Windows-version mode
- `POST /bottles/relaunch-installer` — relaunch an installer bottle's source installer
- `GET /setup/dependencies` — check which deps are installed
- `POST /setup/install-all` — run full dependency installer
- `POST /kill` — kill game by pid or appid
- `GET /logs` — recent log entries
- `GET /logs/stream` — streaming logs
- `GET /logs/crash-reports` — discovered crash report metadata

cd app/src-rust && cargo build --release
```

### Electron app
```bash
cd app && npm install && npm run build
```

### Everything (Rust + TypeScript)
```bash
cd app && npm run build:all
```

### C++ native engine + tests
```bash
./install.sh
# or manually:
mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_TESTS=ON
cmake --build . --parallel $(sysctl -n hw.ncpu)
ctest --output-on-failure
```

```bash
cd app && npm run deb
cd app && npm run deb:docker
tools/linux/create-release-tarballs.sh
tools/linux/publish-oci-packages.sh
```

## CI Workflows

Current CI is split between PR smoke coverage, lightweight main-push workflow validation, and tag-driven release packaging:

| Workflow | Triggers | What it does |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `pr-ci.yml` | PRs to `main` | Shell CI, Metal CI, Vue CI, Rust CI, Electron CI, C/C++/Obj-C CI, and lightweight `DMG Workflow CI` contract validation |
| `ci.yml` | pushes to `main` | Main-branch smoke coverage plus `DMG Workflow CI` contract validation; it does not publish release artifacts |
| `release.yml` | tags `v*` | Developer SDK publish, full arm64 DMG build, DMG runtime-asset verification, release artifact upload, and package publication |
| `publish-linux-packages.yml` | manual | Re-publish Linux DEB/runtime release assets to GHCR with ORAS |

## Version Bumping

Five files must be updated together for a version bump:

| File | Field |
|------|-------|
| `app/package.json` | `"version": "X.Y.Z"` |
| `app/package-lock.json` | root/package lock `"version": "X.Y.Z"` |
| `app/src-rust/Cargo.toml` | `version = "X.Y.Z"` |
| `app/src-rust/Cargo.lock` | `metalsharp-backend` package `version = "X.Y.Z"` |
| `CMakeLists.txt` | `project(metalsharp VERSION X.Y.Z ...)` |

The Rust backend reads its version from `CARGO_PKG_VERSION` (set by Cargo.toml). The CI release workflow (`ci.yml`) reads the version from the git tag — if the tag version differs from `package.json`, it rewrites `package.json` before building.

### Tag and release process

```bash
# 1. Update all synchronized version files to the new version
# 2. Commit and push to main
# 3. Create and push the tag
git tag v<X.Y.Z>
git push origin v<X.Y.Z>
# 4. CI builds the DMG and creates a GitHub Release automatically
```

The `ci.yml` release job only triggers on tag pushes matching `v*`. It builds the full app, packages the DMG and DEB, creates Linux runtime tarballs, publishes Linux OCI package assets, and uploads release artifacts with auto-generated release notes.

The updater module (`updater.rs`) checks for new releases by hitting `https://api.github.com/repos/aaf2tbz/metalsharp/releases/latest` and comparing the tag to `CARGO_PKG_VERSION`.

## Suggested Tests Before Committing

> **Canonical gates:** see [`docs/optimization-roadmap/local-gates.md`](docs/optimization-roadmap/local-gates.md)
> for the full local gate set, including the D3D12 Metal SDK probes CI cannot
> run and the Phase 1–8 backend diagnostic routes.

### Rust changes
```bash
cd app/src-rust
cargo fmt --all -- --check     # must pass (CI enforces)
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings  # must pass (CI enforces)
cargo test                     # unit tests
cargo build --release          # verify build
```

### C++ changes
```bash
mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_TESTS=ON
cmake --build . --parallel $(sysctl -n hw.ncpu)
ctest --output-on-failure
```

### TypeScript/Electron changes
```bash
cd app
npm run build                  # tsc + copy assets
npx biome check src/           # lint (CI enforces)
```

### Integration sanity
- `POST /setup/install-all` → verify progress endpoint shows completion
- `GET /steam/status` → verify returns valid JSON
- `POST /game/launch-auto` with a known appid → verify correct engine selected (check logs)
- `GET /steam/library` → verify games appear with correct launch_method
- `POST /steam/runtime-doctor` with a numeric appid → verify bottle checks/components are returned
- `GET /bottles` and `GET /bottles/redist-sources` → verify bottle metadata loads

## Common Pitfalls

- **Don't edit the Wine plist before running `daemon start`** — let signet create it first, then patch HOME and kickstart
- **DXVK i386 DLLs are at `lib/dxvk/i386-windows/`**, NOT `lib/wine/i386-windows/` — the latter is for Wine builtins
- **Shader cache is per-appid** (`~/.metalsharp/shader-cache/<engine>/<appid>/`), not per-exename
- **Celeste (504230) and Terraria (105600) are Mono/FNA** — they use the native Mono/XNA/FNA lane with Steamworks/audio/native-library shims.
- **Goat Simulator (265930) is currently an M9/D3D9 investigation target** — it still needs native .NET 4.0 CLR work before it can be promoted.
- **CMakeLists.txt version must match Cargo.toml and package.json** — all three are independently read
- **app/package-lock.json version must match package.json** — npm package metadata and release automation both see it
- **Steam game bottles are launch-authoritative, but Steam stays alive as the client** — bottles preflight and bind runtime assets; env-dependent routes spawn the game process with `SteamAppId`/`SteamGameId` while Wine Steam remains connected
- **Installer bottles use their own prefixes** — apps imported from installer bottles must keep `bottle_id` so Sharp Library launches them from that bottle
- **Linux Docker DEB builds can leave `dist/` root-owned** — `tools/linux/create-release-tarballs.sh` repairs ownership before writing `dist/packages`
- **`winemetal.so` has no i386-unix version** — it uses WoW64 thunks for 32-bit PE clients, always lives in x86_64-unix/
- **Steam auto-updates overwrite the steamwebhelper wrapper** — `deploy_steamwebhelper_wrapper()` handles this but it's a known pain point
