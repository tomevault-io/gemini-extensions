# CLAUDE.md - Operating Instructions for Airut

## Project Overview

Airut is a self-hosted gateway that runs sandboxed Claude Code over email and
Slack. Named "Airut" (Finnish: herald/messenger).

Network requests from containers are sandboxed; if requests fail, check
`.airut/network-allowlist.yaml`. See `doc/network-sandbox.md` for details.

## Operational Workflows

The `workflows/` directory contains step-by-step guides. **When a user request
matches any pattern below, you MUST read the workflow file first before taking
any action.** This is not optional - the workflow contains critical steps and
context that cannot be summarized here.

- **Preparing a release** → `workflows/release.md`
  - Release notes, GitHub release creation (version derived from git tag)
- **Maintaining sandbox-action** → `workflows/sandbox-action.md`
  - Setup, changes, releases for `airutorg/sandbox-action` GitHub Action
- **Code review (automated)** → `workflows/code-review.md`
  - Project-specific review checklist used by the code review subagent

Read the entire workflow before starting. Workflows are living documents -
update them if outdated.

## Configuration

Repository-level configuration lives in `.airut/`. See `.airut/README.md` for
details.

Key files:

- `.airut/network-allowlist.yaml` — domains and URL prefixes the container can
  access
- `.airut/container/Dockerfile` — repo-defined container base image
- `.airut/sandbox.yaml` — sandbox-action configuration (CI only, not used by
  gateway)

All per-repo settings (model, effort, resource limits, credentials, container
environment) are configured in the server config (`~/.config/airut/airut.yaml`).
See `spec/repo-config.md` for the full schema.

## Security Model

- **Email authentication** — DMARC verification on trusted
  `Authentication-Results` headers
- **Sender authorization** — allowlist with exact addresses or `*@domain`
  wildcards
- **Container isolation** — each conversation has isolated workspace, Claude
  session, inbox/outbox
- **Network sandbox** — all HTTP(S) routed through mitmproxy enforcing allowlist
  from default branch
- **Credential isolation** — all secrets passed via environment variables, no
  host mounts

## CRITICAL: Workflow Tools

These tools are essential for efficient operation:

```bash
# Run local CI checks (auto-fix formatting, then run all checks)
uv run scripts/ci.py --fix

# Monitor GitHub CI status (after pushing)
uv run scripts/pr.py ci --wait  # Add -v for failure logs

# Fetch review comments
uv run scripts/pr.py review -v
```

**Always run `ci.py --fix` before committing.** It auto-fixes formatting issues
and runs the same checks as GitHub CI (lint, types, tests).

**Do not truncate `ci.py` output** (e.g., with `| tail` or `| grep`). The script
already produces concise, structured output. Truncating hides failures and
forces re-running the entire suite to see what was missed.

## CRITICAL: Always Create PRs

**After completing work that modifies files, create a PR immediately.** Only
skip if: (1) you need user input to finish the task, or (2) user explicitly asks
not to create a PR.

**The task is NOT complete until the PR is created and GitHub CI passes.** This
is the final step of every task, not an optional follow-up. After local CI
passes:

```bash
git push -u origin HEAD && gh pr create --fill
uv run scripts/pr.py ci --wait -v  # Wait for GitHub CI to pass
```

**When task is complete, include the PR URL in your response to the user.** Use
`gh pr view --web` to get the URL, or extract it from the `gh pr create` output.

## CRITICAL: Specs and User Intent Take Priority

**When you encounter issues that require deviating from spec or user-supplied
design, stop and ask for guidance.** Do not prioritize "making tests pass" or
"getting CI green" over adhering to the spec or the user's intent.

Examples where you MUST stop and ask:

- Test failures that reveal the spec is incomplete or contradictory
- Implementation blockers that require changing the agreed-upon design
- Discovering that the task as described conflicts with existing architecture
- Needing to make trade-offs that weren't part of the original plan

Some flexibility is good for minor implementation details, but architectural
decisions, spec changes, and design deviations require user approval. **When in
doubt, ask.** It's better to pause for clarification than to deviate and require
rework.

## CRITICAL: Keep Documentation in Sync

**Before creating a PR, check if docs need updating.** This is a required step,
not optional. Documentation drift causes confusion and wasted time.

Ask yourself: "Did I change behavior that's described in specs?" If yes, update
`spec/*.md` accordingly. Include doc updates in the same commit as the code
change.

## Engineering Process

### Bug Fixes: Test First

**When fixing a bug, always write a failing test first.** This ensures:

1. The bug is reproducible and understood
2. The fix actually addresses the issue
3. The bug doesn't regress in the future

**Workflow:**

1. **Reproduce** - Create a unit or integration test that fails due to the bug
2. **Fix** - Implement the minimal fix to make the test pass
3. **Verify** - Run the test suite to confirm the fix and no regressions

Do not skip the test. "I'll add a test later" means the test won't be added.

### Refactoring: No Legacy Code

**When refactoring, update ALL code to use the new interface.** Do not leave:

- Type aliases pointing to renamed types
- Re-exports for backwards compatibility
- Wrapper functions that just call the new function
- Comments like `# Deprecated: use X instead`
- Unused parameters kept "for compatibility"

If something is renamed or restructured, find and update every usage. Use
grep/search to find all references. Delete the old code entirely - don't wrap
it.

**Why:** Legacy shims accumulate, confuse future readers, and create maintenance
burden. Clean breaks are better than gradual deprecation in a single-user
codebase.

## Git and PR Workflow

**Before starting work:** Create a feature branch from latest main:

```bash
git fetch origin && git checkout -b feature/descriptive-name origin/main
```

**Standard workflow:**

1. Make changes, run `uv run scripts/ci.py --fix` (local CI), commit
2. **Code review subagent** (see below)
3. Push and create PR: `git push -u origin HEAD && gh pr create --fill`
4. **Wait for GitHub CI:** `uv run scripts/pr.py ci --wait -v`
5. Address review: `uv run scripts/pr.py review -v`, fix issues, push
6. Merge (repo uses fast-forward only): `gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch`
7. Return to main: `git checkout main && git pull`

**IMPORTANT: Do not stop after step 3.** The task is complete only when the PR
is created AND GitHub CI passes (step 4).

### Code Review Subagent (Step 2)

After implementation is complete and local CI passes, launch a **code review
subagent** before creating the PR. The subagent must read
`workflows/code-review.md` first, then review the changes.

**Process:**

1. Launch subagent: point it to `workflows/code-review.md` and the current
   branch diff against `origin/main`.
2. Address **every** "must fix" and "should fix" finding from the review —
   including refactoring, clean-up, duplication, and interface issues. Do not
   defer, postpone, or leave findings as TODOs. If the review says it should be
   fixed, fix it now, in this PR.
3. If substantial changes were made, re-run local CI and launch a **new** code
   review subagent to verify the fixes.
4. Iterate until the review is clean (no "must fix" or "should fix" items).
5. Proceed to step 3 (push and create PR).

**Skip code review** only when the change is trivial (docs-only, typo fix,
config-only) or the user explicitly opts out.

**Pre-commit checklist (before step 1):**

- [ ] Bug fix? Write a failing test first (see Engineering Process)
- [ ] Refactoring? Remove all legacy code, no backwards-compat shims
- [ ] Changed behavior? Update specs (see Keep Documentation in Sync)

**If behind main:**
`git fetch origin main && git rebase origin/main && git push --force-with-lease`

**PR maintenance (do this automatically, don't wait to be asked):**

- **Before merging:** Rebase on main and squash commits into a clean history
- **After significant changes:** Update PR title/description to reflect current
  scope (use `gh pr edit --title "..." --body "..."`)
- **Multiple fix-up commits:** Squash with
  `git rebase -i origin/main && git push --force-with-lease`

## CI Requirements

**All checks are mandatory. No workarounds or exceptions.**

- **100% test coverage** - every line in `airut/` must be tested
- **No `pytest.skip()`** - write proper mocks instead
- **No `# type: ignore`** without specific error code and justification
- **No `# noqa`** without specific code and justification
- **Clean worktree** - formatting changes must be committed
- **Timeouts are always bugs** - never "expected in this environment" or
  transient. Root-cause and fix; do not retry or ignore.

## Key Scripts

- `scripts/ci.py` — CI runner (single source of truth for all CI checks)
- `scripts/pr.py` — PR workflow (CI status and review comments)
- `scripts/airut.py` — gateway entry point (`uv run airut`)

## Standards

- **Python 3.13+**, **uv** package manager, **ruff** formatting, **ty** type
  checking
- **Google Python Style Guide**
- Use `logging` module, not `print()`

### Testing

- **No environment-dependent tests** - all tests must behave identically in CI
  and locally
- **No skipped tests** - do not use `pytest.skip()` for tests that depend on
  local files or environment
- **Use mocks for external dependencies** - tests should use fixtures and mocks,
  not real files from gitignored directories
- **Integration tests** live in `tests/integration/` and run via
  `uv run scripts/ci.py --workflow integration` (not included in default pytest)

### Documentation

- **Specs describe architecture and contracts**, not implementation details
- Update specs when implementation diverges from them
- Implementation is the source of truth for details
