# Working in this repo (agent guide)

rlmcp exists so an agent can *watch, diagnose and steer a live training run*.
The failure mode this file is written against is real and was observed: an agent
re-implemented half of rlmcp by hand — its own metrics parser, its own frame
tiling, its own stage ladder in a scratch file — because the entry point it
happened to read first did not mention the feature. Read this before deciding
how to drive a run.

This file is the canonical guide. `CLAUDE.md` is a symlink to it, so an
assistant that looks for that name finds the same text; there is one copy to
maintain and nothing here assumes a particular agent product.

**This file is about working *in* this repository.** To *use* rlmcp, read
[docs/tools.md](docs/tools.md) — every command and MCP tool, one entry each —
and [docs/mcp-server.md](docs/mcp-server.md) if you are driving over MCP.
[docs/tuning.md](docs/tuning.md) is the workflow for driving a training run
well: verify the task before training, watch the right numbers, diagnose
before touching a weight.

## This repo is the tool. The records are somewhere else.

Two repositories, on purpose:

* **this one** — the harness, adapters, CLI and MCP server. Its history should
  be about the tool.
* **your records** — your mjlab task packages and `records/`, the run records.
  That repository holds a package per task (env config, `mdp/` terms, its
  `rlmcp` extension, its curriculum, its launcher), the records those runs
  filled, and its own guidance for *running* experiments: simulator traps,
  verification checks, the run-record lifecycle.

rlmcp is a dependency of that repo, never the other way round. Nothing about a
task — no env config, no reward term, no run record — belongs in this tree. If
you are about to add one, you are in the wrong repository.

`$RLMCP_RECORDS` is what separates them at runtime. The records root resolves to
the explicit argument (`rlmcp record --records-root`, `rlmcp.wrap(records_root=...)`),
then `$RLMCP_RECORDS`, then `./records` — see `open_store` in `rlmcp/records/filestore.py`.
A stray `records/` appearing in this checkout means somebody ran a record command
without the variable set; it is a scratch directory, not the records.

## If you are about to hand-roll something, check here first

| you are about to… | use instead |
| --- | --- |
| grep a task package to find out which task ids exist | `rlmcp tasks` — every registered id, which package registered it, and where its runs land |
| write a scratch script that rolls zero actions to see whether a new task works | `rlmcp check --task <id>` — the six gates (including one training iteration), plus what each reward term pays |
| write a loop that builds a task and steps it so you can poke at it | `rlmcp play --policy zero --mode hold` — a built, stepping, steerable session with no viewer |
| parse `metrics.jsonl` / `status.json` yourself | `rlmcp status`, `rlmcp metrics`, `rlmcp plot` |
| write a loop that pokes weights at milestones | a **curriculum** (`StageSchedule`) — see below |
| add a task-specific verb by editing core code | an **extension** (`rlmcp/extensions/`, or your own package) |
| screenshot by rendering + slicing video frames | `rlmcp shot` (add `--where key=value` to pick envs) |
| judge smoothness from reward curves | `rlmcp diagnose` (measures HF power share, jerk, effort) |
| tell the user "it improved" | `rlmcp video` / `rlmcp plot`, then show them |
| script a clip every N iterations of a run | already done — progress clips at 0, 50, 100, 200 … (`rlmcp video --schedule`) |
| start a viewer, or `play`, to see what a run is doing *now* | `rlmcp view` — a run already serves one; this says where. No restart, no renderer |
| explain that the live view "looks too fast" | `rlmcp view --realtime` — a buffered window played back at 1x, with a player in the tab |
| stop the view costing the run anything, without losing the tab | `rlmcp view --pause` — the frame stays, the port stays, the run goes back to full speed |
| look at a policy whose run has already exited | `rlmcp play` — it restores the conditions the checkpoint trained under first |
| call `env.reset()` yourself to clear a bad state | `rlmcp reset-envs` (`--where key=value` to restart only some) |
| restart `rlmcp play` to see a different checkpoint | `rlmcp run load_policy checkpoint=<path>` — same env, same conditions, new weights |
| compare a metric across several runs | `rlmcp record compare`, or `rlmcp record graph` for the ancestry |
| keep the record of an experiment in a scratch file | `rlmcp record new` / `rlmcp record close` — it belongs **in** the records |

## Where things are

```
rlmcp/core/          parameters, telemetry, traces, curriculum, controller — no backend
rlmcp/adapters/      SimAdapter / RunnerAdapter; mjlab/ is the reference implementation
rlmcp/extensions/    capabilities the core does not know about; terrain.py is the model
rlmcp/records/           the records: plans, outcomes, ancestry, the rendered tree
rlmcp/server/        the MCP server (imports no simulator, by design)
```

The layering rule is one sentence: **the core never learns a task's vocabulary,
and the adapter never learns a capability.** Anything a particular simulator has
and others do not belongs in an `Extension`; anything one task has belongs in an
extension in *that task's* repo.

## Curricula are NOT terrain-only

`rlmcp-train --curriculum {terrain,none}` is a convenience entry point, and its
two choices are the whole of what *that CLI* offers. The library is not so
limited: a curriculum is an ordered list of stages, each of which applies
parameter edits and/or commands on entry and promotes when metric conditions
hold for N consecutive iterations past a floor. Nothing about it is terrain.

```python
from rlmcp.core.curriculum import Action, Condition, CurriculumStage, StageSchedule

schedule = StageSchedule([
    CurriculumStage(
        name="0_learn_to_turn",
        parameters={"reward.fall_penalty.weight": -40.0},
        apply=[Action("set_goal_difficulty", {"threshold": 0.6})],
        promote_when=[Condition("rlmcp/goal_rate_per_min", ">=", 8.0)],
        min_iterations=400, hold_iterations=20,
    ),
    ...
])
env = rlmcp.wrap(env, session_dir=..., curriculum=schedule)
```

A manipulation ladder is the clearest non-terrain example: rungs that start
with the object already held and work up to picking it off a table, each rung
setting reward weights and calling the task extension's own verbs on entry.

**Rule of thumb:** if you are writing down "when metric X passes Y, change
weight Z", that is a `CurriculumStage`, not a note to yourself. Encoding it
means the run drives itself, the ladder is saved with the run
(`params/curriculum.json`), and a human can still override it live with
`rlmcp curriculum advance|goto|auto-off`.

## Task vocabulary belongs in an extension

The core knows parameters, metrics, traces, frames, stages. It does not know
what a "goal", "terrain" or "object set" is. Add those through an `Extension`
(`commands()`, `metrics()`, `select_envs()`, `snapshot()`/`restore()`), which
makes them reachable from the CLI, from MCP `run_command`, **and from a
curriculum stage's `apply`** — all three at once. `rlmcp/extensions/terrain.py`
is the reference for one that ships here; a task package's own extension
module is the task-side equivalent.

An extension in another package registers itself through an entry point in the
`rlmcp.extensions` group, so nothing in this repo has to be edited to add one.

Extension `metrics()` merge into telemetry, so they are usable directly in
promotion conditions. Prefer task-external metrics there (success rate, goals
per minute, holding fraction) over the reward being optimised.

### `select_envs` is dispatched by signature

`ExtensionRegistry.select_envs` calls each extension as
`extension.select_envs(**criteria)` and treats a `TypeError` as "different
vocabulary, not an error". So an extension that declares

```python
def select_envs(self, where: dict): ...      # WRONG: never binds
```

is skipped for every `--where` query, and `rlmcp shot --where holding=true`
fails with *"No extension understands {'holding': 'true'}. This run has: …"* —
naming, in that list, the very extension that was meant to answer. Declare it as
`**criteria`, pop the keys you understand, and return `None` if anything is
left over:

```python
def select_envs(self, **criteria):
    holding = criteria.pop("holding", None)
    if criteria or holding is None:
        return None                          # not our vocabulary
    ...
```

## Promotion metrics: normalise them

Per-episode counts are not comparable across runs whose episodes end at
different lengths. Publish rates (per minute of simulated time) or fractions.
A metric that rises simply because episodes got longer will promote a policy
that has not improved.

## The record is the deliverable — and it lives in the tasks repo

`rlmcp record new` before launching (hypothesis, prediction, falsifier,
`--falsify-when` for the machine-checked version), `rlmcp record close` after,
with measurements. A `validated` verdict without evidence is refused, and that
is deliberate. `rlmcp record check` validates every record; `rlmcp record graph`
draws the ancestry.

All of it writes to `$RLMCP_RECORDS`, which points at the records repository. When
you are working *in this repo* — fixing the harness, adding an adapter — you are
usually not filling a record at all. When you are running an experiment, do it
from the records and follow that repo's `AGENTS.md`.

## Inspection is concurrent

`shot`/`video`/`trace`/`diagnose` are deferred jobs serviced between rollout
batches inside the training process; parameter edits apply between batches, so
they cannot race the simulator. Never pause training to look at it. A separate
probe process (its own small env) is also fine and does not touch the run.

## Branches: open PRs against `main`, never against `integration`

`integration` is **not a branch you target**. It is rebuilt by CI as *main plus
every open PR merged together* (`.github/workflows/integration.yml`), so that a
studio feature needing code spread across two or three unlanded PRs has one
branch to develop against.

That makes it a **build artifact**, and opening a PR against it is a mistake
with a delayed cost: the work lands somewhere that is thrown away and rebuilt,
review happens against a moving base, and nothing reaches `main`.

```
  branch from origin/main  →  PR against main  →  CI rebuilds integration
```

So:

* **Branch from `origin/main`**, not from whatever is checked out. This
  worktree is often on `integration` precisely because something was being
  developed against it.
* **Open the PR against `main`.** It reaches `integration` on its own, within a
  CI run, and it reaches `integration` *because* it is open — so there is
  nothing to do afterwards.
* **Use a fresh worktree** (`git worktree add`) rather than switching this one.
  Several agents work in this repository at once; `git worktree list` usually
  shows a handful, and moving the shared checkout out from under one of them is
  the collision this avoids.
* **One review unit per PR.** A fix and the doc change explaining it can share
  a PR when the doc is small and about that fix; two unrelated behaviours
  cannot.
* **A regression test must fail on `main` first.** Not "the suite passes" —
  check out `origin/main`'s source with your new test in place and watch it
  fail, or the test is not pinning what you think it is.

## Tests

See the Tests section of `README.md` for the current incantation. The suite runs
the real controller against a fake simulator — no GPU and no simulator needed —
and the MCP-server tests skip unless the optional `mcp` package is installed.

## Style: two spaces, and a linter that says so

`ruff check` is the whole style guide, and `[tool.ruff]` in `pyproject.toml` is
where it is written down. Two-space indent, four for a continuation, 100 columns
as a wall (write to ~80), and annotations that read like the py310+ tree this
is. [docs/style.md](docs/style.md) is the long form: what every rule is doing
there, why the ones that are off are off, and how to spell a `noqa`.

```bash
uvx ruff@0.16.4 check rlmcp tests examples      # what CI runs
uvx ruff@0.16.4 check --fix rlmcp tests examples
```

Three places run it for you, all with the same pinned version and the same
config, so they cannot disagree:

* **CI** — a `lint` job on every push and pull request, before the test matrix.
* **`.claude/settings.json`** — a `PostToolUse` hook. An agent that writes a
  `.py` file gets it linted and auto-fixed on the spot, and the leftovers come
  back as an error rather than as a red pull request twenty minutes later.
* **`.pre-commit-config.yaml`** — for a human with `pre-commit install` run.

Do not reach for a formatter. `ruff format` and black are 4-space tools; black
cannot emit two spaces at all, and either one rewrites 99 of the 102 modules
here, re-wrapping line breaks that were placed by hand. The rules that were
deliberately left out — blind `except`, unused protocol arguments, `print` in
the CLI — are listed with their reasons next to the config.
