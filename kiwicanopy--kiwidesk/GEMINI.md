# KiwiDesk — Agent & Contributor Guidelines

Binding rules for human developers and AI agents working on this
repository. Read this file before modifying any code. Every agent
(Claude Code, Cursor, Codex) and human reads it directly.

## How this file is organized

This file is the **hub**: the project shape, the rules that apply
everywhere, and an index of the subsystem guardrails (§5).

The guardrails themselves — the long "here is why this bit us"
arguments — live one level down, in
[`.claude/rules/*.md`](.claude/rules/), **one file per subsystem**.
Each rule file is the canonical text for its subsystem; §5 carries
the rule in one line and links to it. When they would disagree,
the **rule file wins** and the §5 row is the thing to fix.

One deliberate exception to "state it once": the handful of
guardrails at the top of §5 are repeated verbatim in their rule
file. They are the ones that destroy something before a rule file
would ever load — a tree in the state model, a shipped `.app` that
`fatalError`s — so they earn a tripwire in the file every agent
already has. Aim to state everything else exactly once, and see
[rule-authoring.md](.claude/rules/rule-authoring.md) for which
kinds of sentence may be repeated safely and which may not.

§5 also carries **one** prose rule rather than a one-line row:
how to write a rule at all (#614). It is there because it is the
only rule whose subject is this delivery mechanism, and because a
reader who never edits a rule file — Cursor, Codex, a human
skimming the hub — would otherwise meet it nowhere. Its argument
still lives one level down, in
[rule-authoring.md](.claude/rules/rule-authoring.md). Do not read
it as licence for a second long paragraph in §5.

They live in `.claude/` because Claude Code auto-loads a rule file
whose `paths:` glob matches a file you are editing — so the right
guardrails arrive when they are relevant and cost nothing when
they are not. That placement is *only* about the loader. The files
are ordinary Markdown: humans and other agents reach them through
the §5 links, and §5 lists every one of them.

Two shelves, don't confuse them:

- **`docs/`** — the product: Lua reference, user guide, CLI,
  design decisions, accepted limitations. Ships to users through
  the site.
- **`.claude/rules/`** — the workshop: engineering guardrails for
  whoever changes the code.

## 1. Project Overview

KiwiDesk is a tiling window manager for macOS (Swift, SwiftUI,
Lua). It manages windows in a **flat, one-dimensional array per
space** — never in hierarchical trees. Layout algorithms are pure
functions over that array.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[UI / SwiftUI App] <-->|Settings & Profiles| B[App Core / Swift]
    B <-->|Bridge| C[Lua Engine / VM]
    B -->|Calls| D[OS Layer / Private APIs & AX]
```

Module layout (SwiftPM targets):

| Target | Path | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| `KiwiDeskCore` | `Sources/KiwiDeskCore` | State, events, OS bridge |
| `KiwiDesk` | `Sources/KiwiDesk` | Executable, menu bar, GUI |
| `KiwiDeskCoreTests` | `Tests/KiwiDeskCoreTests` | Unit tests |
| `KiwiDeskGuiTests` | `Tests/KiwiDeskGuiTests` | GUI tests, plus the source-scanning parity guards (`SourceScan`) — which scan **both** trees, so a `KiwiDeskCore` invariant may be guarded from here |

The Swift core must stay strictly separated from the SwiftUI GUI
and (later) the Lua VM.

Subsystem map (`Sources/KiwiDeskCore/*`) — directory-level, not a
file list; grep within a subsystem for specifics:

| Dir | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `State` | Flat `[WindowID]`-per-space window state |
| `Tiling` | Placing windows from state into layouts |
| `Layouts` | Pure layout algorithms over the flat array |
| `Commands` | Command dispatch (the `set_*` verbs), plus the z-order raise machinery every command path shares (`ZOrderDrain` and its policy) |
| `Config` | Decoding the Lua/profile config into settings |
| `Profiles` | Profile JSON load/save & defaults |
| `Appearance` | Color palettes (bundled + user, one-shot apply) |
| `Lua` | Lua VM bridge, watchdog, registry refs |
| `AX` | Accessibility bridge & `AXObserver` callbacks |
| `OS` | Private SkyLight/CGS symbols via `dlsym`, AX fallback |
| `Keys` | Carbon hotkey registration |
| `Events` | Event listening / mouse drag taps |
| `Tabs` | Native-tab reconciliation (`windowRekeyed` coalescing) |
| `Animation` | Per-monitor `DisplayLink` animation |
| `IPC` | CLI / external command IPC |
| `Bar` | In-app App Bar & Space Bar overlays |
| `Borders` | Focus & sticky overlays (rings, sticky marks) |
| `Power` | Power / display-state handling |
| `Permissions` | AX / permission prompts |
| `Localization` | `L()` string routing & locale catalogs |
| `App` | Core bootstrap & wiring |
| `Models` | Shared value types |
| `Service` | Long-running service glue |
| `Resources` | Bundled assets (locales, vendored app font, palettes) (assets, not code) |

The GUI lives in `Sources/KiwiDesk` — layout conventions in
[`.claude/rules/gui.md`](.claude/rules/gui.md).

This table is the *where*. For the *how* — end-to-end pipelines
(event→placement, command dispatch, config resolve, animation)
traced at directory altitude — see **`docs/architecture.md`**.

## 2. Code Rules

1. **File size:** target **100–250 lines** per Swift file. Hard
   ceiling **350** (only for cohesive, performance-critical
   logic). Split before you cross it.
2. **Line length:** max **79 characters**. Enforced by the
   pre-commit hook and CI (`scripts/lint.sh`).
3. **Single Responsibility:** one class/struct = one job (event
   listening, layout math, IPC — never mixed).
4. **DRY vs. readability:** extract shared helpers (`AXHelper`,
   `GeometryUtils`) instead of duplicating, but prefer a small,
   readable duplication over a deep protocol hierarchy or heavy
   generics. Keep code flat.
5. **Formatting:** `swift format` with the repo's `.swift-format`
   config owns all style, and `scripts/lint.sh` additionally
   enforces the §2.1 line-length and file-size limits. Linting is
   its own step, **not** a build-tool plugin — `Package.swift`
   carries why the SwiftLint prebuild plugin was removed, so
   `.swiftlint.yml` no longer runs during a build. Run
   `scripts/lint.sh` before committing — its **exit code**
   decides, not its warnings.
6. **Concurrency:** AppKit/AX interaction is `@MainActor`. Pure
   state and layout code stays actor-free and unit-testable.
7. **GUI north-star — simplicity, intuitiveness, Apple-native
   feeling, in that order**, and **approachable by default,
   powerful on demand**: "Apple-native" binds *behavior*
   (standard controls working the standard way), not the
   Settings GUI's visual idiom — the window's IA and look are
   KiwiDesk's own — and a new user should get a
   good setup with almost no configuration without that
   simplicity capping what Lua can reach. The full principle,
   its corollaries and the settled conventions that fall out of
   it are in [`.claude/rules/gui.md`](.claude/rules/gui.md);
   `docs/ui-patterns.md` holds the shared control conventions
   and `docs/design-decisions.md` the rulings behind them.
8. **Comments: state the constraint, cite the ruling, stop.**
   A comment carries only what the code cannot show — a
   non-obvious invariant, a platform trap, the why behind a
   choice that looks wrong. Budget: 1–3 lines plus the issue
   ref (`#NNN`) where an argument exists; the argument itself
   lives in the issue, the owning rule file, or
   `docs/design-decisions.md`, never in the source. A
   docstring states the contract — what it does, units,
   threading, ownership — not the design history. Never
   write: how the code got here, alternatives considered and
   rejected, what the next line visibly does, or justification
   aimed at a reviewer. One exception: a docstring a rule file
   or guard names as a canonical home — a census like
   `OwnWindowTiling`'s doc, or a number-pin's retuning
   argument ([tests.md](.claude/rules/tests.md), #1021) —
   keeps whatever length that job needs.

## 3. Workflow: Refine → Plan → Act → Verify

1. **Refine:** read the relevant code and specs before proposing
   changes; clarify ambiguities first.
2. **Plan:** for features and major fixes, write a short written
   plan (files to change, API surface, tests) before
   implementing.
3. **Act:** implement step by step; keep commits focused.
4. **Verify:** run the **`verify-gate` skill**
   ([`.claude/skills/verify-gate`](.claude/skills/verify-gate/SKILL.md))
   — `swift build`, the test run, `scripts/lint.sh`,
   and the release build when the change touches concurrency or
   `Sendable`. That skill owns the procedure — which gate a change
   earns, what to run, in what order, and when CI's `Release
   Build` job substitutes for a local one.
5. **Document:** any user-visible behavior change updates the
   matching doc in the same change set — code and docs must
   never describe different behavior. Which doc owns what, and
   the `docs/design-decisions.md` charter, are in
   [`.claude/rules/docs.md`](.claude/rules/docs.md); the site's
   half of it in [`.claude/rules/site.md`](.claude/rules/site.md).
6. **Review:** once a substantial change is finished, verified
   and committed, run the **`review-change` skill**
   ([`.claude/skills/review-change`](.claude/skills/review-change/SKILL.md))
   — `code-reviewer` and `architect-reviewer` on the diff since
   the last review point, plus the specialist lanes the diff
   opens. Address or consciously dismiss every finding before
   opening a PR. That skill owns the sequencing (parallel first
   round, which lanes a diff earns, sequential re-review of a
   substantial fix batch) and the agent-reuse rules.

### Branching & Pull Requests

Branch from `main` with a name matching the Conventional Commit
type: `feat/`, `fix/`, `refactor/`, `docs/`, `test/`, `chore/`,
`ci/`, `perf/`, then a short kebab-case description (e.g.
`feat/scrolling-snap-mode`). One focused change per branch;
separate refactors from features.

Use the GitHub [issue templates](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/) and
[PR template](.github/pull_request_template.md). Reference issues
with `fixes #123`.

**Merge through the queue** (owner ruling 2026-08-30): `main`
carries a merge-queue ruleset, so land a green PR with "Merge
when ready" (`gh pr merge <n> --auto --squash`) and let the
queue validate it against whatever is queued ahead — never merge
directly, and never hand-rebase a branch just to satisfy
staleness, which the queue now owns.

**An agent drafting an issue renders the template, rather than
writing whatever shape it likes.** GitHub applies a `.yml` form
only when a human opens the *New issue* page (observed
2026-08-02, `gh` 2.x), so `gh issue create --body-file` — the way
an agent files one — starts from a blank body and silently keeps
none of it. The reason the template must be reproduced anyway is
not tidiness. Those fields are
the questions a maintainer needs answered *before* triaging, and
an agent that skips them is skipping the questions, not just the
formatting — the templates ask for the macOS version and the
other AX tools running because that is what half of KiwiDesk's
bug reports turn on.

Pick the template by what the issue *is*: `bug_report` when
something shipped behaves wrongly (including a guard that cannot
fail — the repro is the mutation that ought to red it),
`feature_request` for new or retuned behavior, `docs_report` for
prose, `collector` / `roadmap` for grouping. (`config.yml` is not
a template — it is the chooser, and it turns blank issues off, so
one of the five above is the only way in.) Every one of them is
written for a **user**, so an internal engineering issue will have
fields that fit awkwardly — answer them honestly from the dev
machine rather than dropping them or inventing a new shape
inline.

Beyond the body: give every issue GitHub's **Type** (Bug /
Feature / Task) and the repo's **Priority** and **Effort**
issue fields at filing, not in a later sweep — an unranked
issue is invisible to the roadmap's ordering. **Rule the
milestone at filing too**, including ruling it EMPTY: a
milestone says which release must not ship without the issue,
so leaving it unanswered is not the same as answering "the
release does not wait for this". The
**`file-issue` skill**
([.claude/skills/file-issue](.claude/skills/file-issue/SKILL.md))
owns the whole filing procedure — the template reproduction,
setting the Type and both fields, the milestone question, and
the Priority/Effort ladders. Type says what the retired `bug` / `enhancement` /
`documentation` / `feat` labels used to say; never apply those
labels to an issue again.

### Commit messages (Angular / Conventional Commits)

`type(scope): subject` — imperative, lower-case, no trailing
period. Optional body explains the why, wrapped at 72 columns.

- Types: `feat`, `fix`, `perf`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`,
  `build`, `ci`, `chore`.
- Scope is the touched area (`animation`, `tiling`, `layout`,
  `commands`, `lua`, `ax`, `profiles`, `docs`); omit when the
  change is repo-wide.
- Examples: `feat(layout): add stack.set_overflow_style`,
  `fix(tiling): defer z-order restore until animations settle`.

## 4. Tooling

Shared automation lives in the visible `/scripts/` directory,
never hidden in dot-folders: lint, git hooks, localization
scripts.

- `./scripts/install-hooks.sh` once per clone. The `pre-commit`
  hook lints staged Swift, runs the locale checks, and **refuses
  a commit while HEAD is `main`** (override with
  `KIWIDESK_ALLOW_MAIN_COMMIT=1`, never `--no-verify`).
- `./scripts/build-app.sh` packages, signs and optionally
  notarizes the `.app` (#89) — see
  [packaging-and-release.md](.claude/rules/packaging-and-release.md).
- `./scripts/release.sh <version>` cuts a release, and runs
  **twice**: first it stamps the version, runs the gate and opens
  a `chore/stamp-<version>` PR (protected `main` takes no direct
  push); then, on a synced `main` after that PR merges, the same
  command cuts and pushes the tag. The pushed tag fires
  `.github/workflows/release.yml`, which re-verifies the tag,
  builds every distributable artifact and drafts the release with
  all of them attached — same rule file.
- `./scripts/sync-agents.sh` regenerates the Codex mirror
  (`.codex/agents/*.toml`) from the committed Claude Code agents in
  `.claude/agents/`, which are the source of truth and need no
  install step. `--check` fails when the mirror is stale — see
  [subagents.md](.claude/rules/subagents.md).
- Optional, per-developer: the `caveman` skill compresses agent
  output — not a build dependency, needs Node `>= 18`:
  `npx -y github:JuliusBrussee/caveman --non-interactive`.
  `--non-interactive` avoids a hang when piped; scope it with
  `--only claude`, `--minimal`, or `--uninstall`.
- CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) builds, lints and tests on
  pushes to `main` and on PRs targeting it. Its two macOS jobs are
  gated on a `changes` job, so a change confined to
  `.github/ci-ignore.txt`'s list leaves them skipped. A red build
  blocks merging. Adding an entry to that list needs
  [packaging-and-release.md](.claude/rules/packaging-and-release.md)
  — the test suite is not the only thing that reads a path.

### Subagent delegation (AI agents)

Spin subagents off proactively where the payoff is clear — no
need to wait to be asked. A subagent starts with zero
conversation context, so delegate work that does not depend on
it: broad fan-out searches where only the conclusion matters
(`Explore`), independent review passes on a finished change
(`code-reviewer`, `architect-reviewer`), proving a new guard
actually reds (`guard-prover`), and parallel isolated
implementation work that would otherwise serialize.

Stay inline for anything small, sequential, or dependent on
conversation context: a cold agent re-deriving what the session
already knows costs more than it saves.

The delegation call is made here, while editing something else,
which is why it lives in this file. The roster itself — who
exists, what each one is for, and how an agent file must be
written — is in [subagents.md](.claude/rules/subagents.md), which
loads when you edit one.

## 5. Guardrails (Known Pitfalls)

These apply everywhere, whatever you touch:

- **Rename code freely; a stored VALUE needs a crossing.**
  Nothing external depends on the current command names, Lua/CLI
  verbs or event names — rename and restructure those outright
  (#42 renamed the space commands), and add no compatibility
  aliases or deprecation layers for them.
  **File formats are no longer in that set.** The old rule read
  "pre-release, single user… re-editing the config *is* the
  migration", and that premise expired the day v0.9.7 went to
  people who are not the author. A rename that changes a stored
  value or key therefore owes a one-shot migration in
  `ConfigMigration` — it rewrites the file, so it ENDS — and
  never a lenient decoder, which cannot: nothing ever signals
  that the last config carrying the retired spelling is gone.
  Decoders stay strict, and the crossing reaches EVERY reader of
  that file shape — `ConfigMigrationRoutingTests` is the census,
  not a sentence. The stake is the FILE, never the renamed
  setting: config files decode as a unit, so one unreadable value
  costs everything beside it (`ConfigMigrationTests`; the
  evidence is in [profiles.md](.claude/rules/profiles.md)).
- **Windows live in a flat `[WindowID]` array per space.** Never
  introduce tree or container structures into state or layout.
- **Never disable SIP, or ask a user to.** Every private fast
  path has a public-API fallback.
- **Never `Bundle.module` in code that runs from the `.app`** —
  go through `ResourceBundle.locate`. It resolves on the machine
  that built it and `fatalError`s everywhere else.
- **Space identifiers are strings** and case-sensitive; numeric
  strings and integers are equivalent (`"1"` == `1`).

Everything else is indexed below. **Read the rule file before
editing its subsystem** — the row is the rule, the file is the
argument, and Claude Code loads the file automatically when you
touch a matching path.

| Touching | Read | The rule, in one line |
|---|---|---|
| Anywhere in `Sources/KiwiDeskCore` | [core-boundaries.md](.claude/rules/core-boundaries.md) | Core returns structure and the GUI renders the sentence (#96); CLI/IPC errors stay English; never `Bundle.module`; a declared `onLog` seam defaults to `CoreLog.write` and is wired in `KiwiCore+Bootstrap`; a capture diagnostic logs via `os.Logger` with `privacy: .public`, never `NSLog`, which macOS redacts; and a new command owes a record in `Commands/Reference` whose enum arguments name the TYPE so the values are read off `allCases` — the same derivation a decoder's rejection takes through `CommandResponse.expected(_:)`, never a hand-typed list (#1033, `APIRecordCensusTests`, `APIChoiceDerivationTests`, `CommandRejectionDerivationTests`) — while a record's argument list and summary are REVIEW's, written against the parser, a value shape no argument kind covers explaining itself in the summary |
| `State`, `Tiling`, `Layouts`, `Commands`, `App`, `Tabs`, `Models` | [state-and-layout.md](.claude/rules/state-and-layout.md) | Flat array, pure layouts; a window's Space is stored per PROFILE and never per DESKTOP — the discriminator is WHEN a record is authoritative, so the Desktop copy would be read while the compositor is still moving what it copies while a profile's partitioning is written as it goes inactive and read as it returns, and a round trip merges the arrangement away without it (#1230, `ProfileSpacesSeamTests`, which pins one door per axis and every `[DesktopKey: …]` map in Core against a named register) — from which a new per-`Space` field is keyed by `WindowID` or it is SHARED across Desktops; display bounds only via `TilingEngine.visibleBounds` (#531) and spans via `layoutBounds(on:)` (#537) — the guards' `allowed` maps are the one copy of who is exempt; a native tab switch is a re-key, not destroy+create (#308); the sticky render verdict is DERIVED rather than handed in — `stickyRenderSpace(of:)` and its three derivations read the one active Space themselves, and a caller passing another is lying to the predicate rather than configuring it (#1225, #1214);  a float safety NET asks the one `EffectiveFloat.applies` — flag OR floating-mode space, judged on the space the window LANDED in — never the flag alone, while a VERB the `EffectiveFloat` docstring does not name as ruled keeps the flag until ruled the same way — one verb at a time, that docstring the one roster, and a verb that crosses standing down on BOTH arms for a native-fullscreen window (#1178/#1184/#670, `EffectiveFloatTests`, `FloatingModeBarClampTests`, `FloatingResizeCommandTests`) — and a tiled sticky traveler rendering on a floating-mode space of ANOTHER display is moved onto it proportionally by the one retile-time net, never left where the previous space drew it (#1217, `TravelerRehomeConsumerTests`); where a float may sit is derived ONCE in `KiwiCore.floatBounds` — painted strips carved off the visible bounds, never `layoutBounds` — bounding a float's SIZE while its POSITION stays the user's, and the keyboard resize splits its delta between both edges with a boundary edge PINNED, on shrink as well as grow or the pair stops being reversible at an edge (#1091, `FloatSymmetricResizeTests`); an explicit `set_*` apply forces the retile; only a pass whose windows are all spring-sized may promise `BatchSizing.allSpringSized` (#593); the create fold's spawn grant consults `isTransientOverlay` first, read from state (#671); a mutation that changes which windows overlap arms the matching z-order restore after its own retile, and narrowly (#674) — and a removal whose close-return raise stood down arms no track restore either, the one `closeReturnRaiseStandsDown` predicate governing the raise and the arm alike (#936); an arm refuses its own re-arm semantically, never via the warp-scoped in-flight counter (#689); an echo ledger — `zOrderRaiseEchoes`, `selfRaiseStamps` — is age-bounded and NEVER consumed by its echo, a lazy app's duplicate landing after the user's next step, so a reader telling our raise from theirs asks the ORDER of the stamps, never their presence (#887, `SelfRaiseDuplicateEchoTests`, `RaiseEchoClickTests`, `ActivationReReportTests`) — and `TilingEngine.placements` is the one ledger read by GEOMETRY instead: a clickless focus, after focus moved on, of a window KiwiDesk just moved or stepped off in the active scrolling Space is the app's answer — a narrower arm owes a device sitting — every raise mints its self stamp through the one `stampSelfRaise`, and a distrust renews the placement through the ledger's bounded `renew` door rather than a stamp (#1161, `PlacementBounceTests`, `PlacementDisplacementTests`, `PlacementLedgerTests`, `PlacementBounceSeamTests`) — a report the focus command already INTENDED is never bounced, and `focusOwnWindow(number:)` beside the arm is the door an own-window raise takes (#1281, `PlacementIntentTests`); ordered raises go through the sequence, which verifies each landing because the AX call returns before the app performs it (#684) — the teardown restack included, on a budget of its own and without the one window no raise can beat (#688); a native-fullscreen window keeps its slot but leaves the tiled member derivations, and the fullscreen-space verdict is `isUser`, never the nil space number (#670); a context site that materializes scrolled-out scrolling frames — or monocle's parked frames (#881) — threads `screenNeighbors`, detected fresh each retile over the `allScreenBounds` seam — never cached, never re-enumerated beside it, and a corner consumer takes its preference from the one `optimalHideCorner(neighbors:)` copy (#878); an app-enforced size bound is learned from the engine's own asks (#677) — a twice-refused target stops re-issuing, a frame-producing context build threads `sizeBounds`, a size change outside our asks invalidates the ledger, and while ENTRIES never generalize across asks, a CORROBORATED bound answers asks beyond it revocably, per-ask entries outranking it (#1055, `SizeBoundGeneralizationTests`) — a GONE window parking its ledger in the revive tombstone rather than forgetting (#1049) — only the layout loop records asks, and only a SETTLED read may confirm a bound or clear learning on a compliance — a raw echo seeds and refreshes, and promotes only through #1049's comply-then-revoke pair, where an echo already reported the window AT the asked size; every other raw promotion is barred, because an echo equal to the pre-ask frame cannot be told from an app that has not redrawn (#1049/#1083, `SizeBoundBaselineTests`); a scrolling viewport offset travels with the slot it was measured against, in ONE `ScrollRest` value, and `ScrollingLayout+Offset.heldBase` is the one place a focus change is told from a row that moved underneath an unchanged focus (#966, `ScrollingResizeAnchorTests`) — the place it holds being the slot's leading edge unless that slot was resting flush against the trailing border, which is the edge it keeps instead; and a scrolling resize press is ONE pure decision — `ScrollSlotDomain`, reached only from the `writeCapped*` seam: measured from whichever of the DRAWN span and the store lies FORWARD of the press — never across it, or the write trims the row on a grow and raises it on a shrink (#1083, `ScrollSlotDomainTests`) — refusing in place where its bound blocks, never reducing a configured value on a GROW, the ceiling being the area the layout DRAWS and never in the value type (#966/#1057, `ScrollSlotDomainTests`, `ScrollingSlotCeilingTests`) — which a corroborated learned app maximum joins, refusing a shared store rather than trimming it, cued where the viewport stays wordless (#1055, `ScrollingAppCeilingTests`); an interactive resize write goes through the shared capped `writeCapped*` writers, named by the prefix rather than a file since the set has outgrown one, and its refusal names a window that write could have MOVED — the own-minimum wording is owed only to a focused window ON the binding side, stated by the writer from its own partition and never inferred from the gesture, a GEOMETRIC partition (bsp's sides) dropping a window that spans the axis, an axis nothing divides cueing on the FIRST press while the WRITE still lands — the store outlives the window population — and `noAxisHere` reserved for the axis whose sibling DOES divide, while a group with ONE member takes `nothingToDivide` and says whether the other axis divides, judged on what the layout DREW rather than a member count, and every `.fail` a resize path returns is cued or named in the census register with the reason it stays wordless (#1259/#1258, `ResizeRefusalTargetingTests`, `NothingToDivideCueTests`, `ResizeRefusalCensusTests`), a weight clamp divides the span the layout divides via the one `StackLayout.weightedSpan` copy (#933), and a track session weight store also rides the retile-time feasibility heal, which a new store joins — while a track fold consumer takes the one `TrackLayout.foldedPartition` assembly, never a hand copy (#944); and the ignored-panel distrust mutates only through its one state machine in `KiwiCore+IgnoredPanel.swift` (#951, `IgnoredPanelGraceTests`) — the #958 accessibility-steal return debt is its sibling, owned the same one-machine way by `KiwiCore+AccessibilityReturn.swift` (`AccessibilityReturnTests`); and a window that lands on a display other than the one its space lays out on takes the space THAT display shows, through the one `screenHome` predicate its two routes share — the create fold deciding from the `arrivalDisplay` its producer mirrors in above it (#1010, `ArrivalScreenHomeTests`, `ScreenHomePredicateTests`) — and an explicit `space:` on a Desktop move is a PENDING assignment paid at the DEPARTURE into the remembered-space memory, never an eager membership write for a hidden target, while a shown target files now, a Space on another screen is refused, an unowned one is accepted on one screen only and never hand-assigned, its landing screen carried on the resolution, the write takes the one sticky gate told where the Space will lay out, and every membership filing goes through the one `fileMembership` (#1150, `DesktopMoveSpaceTargetTests`, `DesktopMoveSpaceGateTests`, `PendingSpaceAssignmentTests`, `PendingSpaceSeamTests`); and a follow owes the window it sent to an unshown Desktop a focus, recorded only for a switch that happened, paid at that window's own ARRIVAL as a space switch rather than a bare focus, with the departure's raise stood down through the one stand-down predicate (#1007, `FollowFocusSeamTests`); and a Desktop switch is not a close — each space's last HONORED focus is remembered at the focus REPORT, never by a fold or the switch handler (a fast app's destroys precede the notification), owed at the return as a second `FollowFocusIntent` instance only for a window GONE from state, paid by the create fold at that window's own ARRIVAL with the settle's raise shape, the vacancy held against other returning windows while it is still departed and the settle's refocus stood down while the debt is unpaid — retired at the next return or by a focus honored in the active space meanwhile, stood down behind a standing follow, a present window (a carried sticky, an OS-restored focus already honored) never owed — and a departed window returns to its slot by RANK (#1207, `ReturningFocusFoldTests`, `ReturningSlotFoldTests`, `DesktopFocusMemoryTests`, `DesktopFocusPaymentTests`, `ReturningFocusSeamTests`); and sticky Desktop reach is a CARRY, never a membership — `KiwiCore+StickyReach` MOVES every enabled sticky window onto the current Desktop of the screen it RENDERS on at each switch and settle, on the one membership write the bridge applies (os-private-apis.md), ledgerless and with nothing to retire (#1145, `StickyReachCarryTests`); and a window on an away Desktop is KNOWN in the away ledger beside the state — written only by the gone handler on a compositor-confirmed `vanished` and by the boot seed, never a member, ended by the return, the census prune, the app's exit and the #634 reset — reach and bookkeeping but NEVER a bar row — the Space Bar draws the Desktop in front of the user, so a bar derivation that merges the ledger is the bug (#1228) — while a reader that does need the returning row merges by rank through the one `withAwayMembers` and carries the unfiled skip branch (#1146, `AwayLedgerTests`, `SpaceBarAwayTests`, `OpenOrFocusReachTests`, `AwayBootSeedTests`) |
| `Config`, `Profiles`, `Commands` | [profiles.md](.claude/rules/profiles.md) | File durable per-Desktop state under `DesktopKey` — the stamp KiwiDesk writes into a Desktop's own WindowServer record, its Mission Control number only where there is none — and never resolve a binding through that number, which survives as a PROJECTION for labelling alone; only the ruled minters call `stampedDesktopSnapshot()` (profiles.md names them, and its one reading carries the re-key so no caller can forget it) while every other path READS, and a record whose Desktop no reading can name stays DORMANT rather than pruned, since absence is not proof — an unplugged screen's Desktops come back with their stamps (#1147, `DesktopBindingIdentityTests`, `DesktopStampSeamTests`); a renamed stored value owes a one-shot migration that reaches every reader of that file shape — a `SetupBundle` carries `[Profile]` inline and is the second one (`ConfigMigrationRoutingTests`); the seeded keymap is TWO bases plus one key — `⌥⌘` carries the verbs you HOLD (size), `⌃⌥` the verbs you PRESS (the positional ladder on arrows and digits, the toggles on letters), and `⌃⌥K` is app chrome rather than a window verb; never spend `⇧` on a lettered row — it qualifies a positional verb, "act on the window", which is the one meaning it has (#1094, `DefaultKeybindingsTests` ▸ `shiftNeverQualifiesALetter`), and since #1176 the position it qualifies is a DIGIT: the arrows escalate to `⌃⌥⌘`, which carries swap beside move-and-follow and so no longer means only "and follow" (`DefaultKeybindingLadderTests` ▸ `arrowsRideTheirOwnTiers`); a new default on `⌥⌘` carries digits and safe letters only and never arrows, and is checked against `SystemShortcuts.map` — which is NECESSARY and not sufficient, since it models macOS's own chords and is structurally blind to the app menus that hold most real collisions, so measure those too (#1075/#1098, `SizeLayerSeedTests`); a profile owns tiling plus *sparse behavior overrides*, never anything that routes or selects the profile itself; the two profile writes mean different things — the quick menu's Keep is a whole-live snapshot, a Settings Save is a DRAFT COMMIT that applies and persists only the spaces the draft edited, with the draft's modes seeded from the SAVED profile and "edited" answered by the one `SettingsDraftDiff.editedSpaceModes` its three readers share (#1179, `SettingsSaveTemporaryLayoutTests`); `isGuiManaged` is the one ownership predicate; the starter setup is DERIVED from the connected screens and its tuning is profile-wide, named by the main screen (`StarterSetupSeedTests`) — never a per-display seam — while which layout a screen OPENS in is read by width rank instead, one deliberate repeat and all, through the one `StarterAllocation.lead(_:of:)` (#1018, `StarterLeadTests`); a call site takes `workflows`, `all(sizes:)` or `standard(for:)` by rule rather than by preference, and an unlisted mode in a sparse preset follows the screen it lands on (`SparseModeFallbackTests`); a new file in the config directory joins `ConfigArtifact` AND answers "does this travel in a backup?" in the same change set, neither alone; a change breaking the decoded shape of anything a bundle carries bumps `SetupBundle.currentFormat`, breaking Profile or GuiConfig schema bumps `Profile.currentFormat` / `GuiConfig.currentFormat`, and a breaking palette schema change bumps `PaletteDocument.currentFormat` AND the bundle's, ruling the markerless exported-palette sidecar deliberately — none of which anything can guard; `SetupBundleTests` holds the bundle's shape both ways by reflection and `SetupBundleArtifactTests` the register, but neither sees a store that never joined (#606); a binding, profile-selection or Desktop-memory path reads the active Desktop from `NativeSpaces.activeDesktopNumber()` — the MAIN screen's — never the global `activeSpaceNumber()`, whose one sanctioned caller is the snapshot's own fallback (`DesktopAuthorityRoutingTests`' `allowed` map), and a switch handler answers every question from ONE `desktopSnapshot()` and decides nothing from a nil Desktop number (#888) — while a surface OFFERING a Desktop verb takes the wider `userDesktops`, every screen's, since the verb acts on the screen that Desktop lives on (`DesktopAuthorityTests`) |

| `Borders` | [borders.md](.claude/rules/borders.md) | The overlay panels carry `.canJoinAllSpaces` so a carried sticky window's mark and ring follow it across Desktops (#1145, `StickyOverlaySpanTests`); `FollowSource` owns which frame the ring AND mark render — never re-implement it beside a call site, and a new decision input enters through its signature (the #677 size pin rides the tick this way); mid-animation the commanded tick leads and every state-reading channel (echo, WS re-read, `sync` geometry) stands down; the settle passes are two keys, early visibility and late geometry; an own key window that is not the focus anchor stands the focused ring down, read from the one `EventLoop.ownKeyWindow` seam the #929 raise stand-down shares — one reading, two ruled facets: the ring takes the broad `number`, the raise the narrow `isDialog` (#933/#935) |

`NSCursor.set()` never push/pop; no window controller changes the activation policy (`ActivationPolicySeamTests`' `allowed` map is the one copy of who may); the Settings window is the one own window that tiles and `OwnWindowTilingSeamTests`' map is the one copy of who may stamp its mark (#678 item 18); keep `body` shallow or the CI type-checker dies; every animation THIS TREE starts names its Reduce Motion gate IN ITS ARGUMENT — both `withAnimation` and `.animation(_:value:)`, a Core animation being gated at its own site or not at all, held PER CALL by `ReduceMotionGateTests` whose empty `allowed` map is the one copy of who may skip it, and whose `entryPoints` is the census of the spellings that start motion, the spellings nothing scans pinned at zero by `ReduceMotionCensusTests`, which is as complete as a hand-listed register gets (#989/#1069) — with the gate spelled at the call rather than folded into a shared accessor, since an indirection the scan cannot follow ungates every caller at once;  a window that must not be covered by a bar takes `BarPanel.aboveLevel` rather than spelling `.floating` again; a new GUI directory that draws chrome joins the ONE scan-root list, `ChromeScanRoots`, in the same change — one that renders a schematic joins `LayoutSchematicPlacementScanTests`' narrower roots as well, and each guard carries a root-coverage check; a Settings-row change updates its `SettingKey` census entry in the same change set (#678); a colour renders in exactly one area (`SettingsColorSurfaceTests`' allow-list is the one copy of who may); one census key may draw many rows, and which keys draw none is data rather than a skipped branch (`ShortcutsCensusRenderTests`); a capability used in one list unlocks that list and nothing else; a row with no visible label authors its census label key as an `.accessibilityLabel` and a sentence with controls in it is one localized frame whose own literals carry its spacing (`AppRulesCensusRenderTests`, `SentenceFrameTests`, `AppRuleSentenceLayoutTests`); a count-driven preview is guarded by its arithmetic rather than by a scan for the input (`LayoutSchematicCountTests`); a preview claiming engine behavior calls the engine instead of re-implementing it beside the drawing (#702, `LayoutSchematicPlacementTests`, `LayoutSchematicScrollingTests`, `LayoutSchematicPlacementScanTests`), and a frame that sorts the array into zones guards the membership rather than only the sizes (#707, `LayoutSchematicZoneTests`); a schematic draws one frame and a fact about motion goes in the caption — which then switches with the control that changes it and never points at a mark the frame does not draw (`LayoutSchematicCaptionTests` holds both) — while a fact a thumbnail cannot render is drawn at `.panel` and left undrawn at `.tile` (#753, `LayoutSchematicScaleTests`); a value belonging inside a sentence is interpolated into it even when the pieces are sibling VIEWS (`CrossReferenceRowSlotTests`); an AppKit control re-earns the focus, keyboard, VoiceOver and `isEnabled` its SwiftUI twin gave free (`LinkedCaptionHitTests`); Home is the only navigator — card offers go through the one predicate (`HomeCardOrderTests`), navigation into a mode-withheld area switches the mode, and a new shell surfacing branch joins `HomeSurfacingTests` in the same change; a profile card's picture rides the desktop plate in the user's palette with the fold floored against it (`HomeCardChromeTests`); the detail view is two columns where `SettingsDetailPanelOffer` says so — the panel is the section's SIBLING, so it reads nothing from an environment the section applies — a selection through ONE coalesced reading on `nav`, live machine state read at the panel once per render (#1127/#798, `KeyboardLayerWiringTests`, `KeyboardHoverWiringTests`) — the panel watches the draft, migrated previews never return to their cards, and the floating save pill exists only while the draft does (`DetailPanelTests`, `HomeSurfacingTests`) and every reason it appears owes a row in its own list — config leaves through `SettingsDraftDiff`, live drift through the ONE `profileDrift` verdict the header reads too (#1197, `SettingsDriftRowsTests`); a picture whose object is NOT the draft takes a read-only sheet instead, which answers Return AND Escape and is hosted above the subtree that opens it (#859, `SheetPresentationSeamTests` is the register of who may host one, `PresetPreviewSheetTests` the structural no-draft half); a presentation built from ONE row is handed that row by `item:`, sheet or popover alike (#843); a diff row narrates through `SettingsValueReadout`, whose totality net covers every model-path census key (`SettingsValueReadoutTests`); a shortcut row reads the live enabled bit from ONE per-section environment value and picks its wording through `ConflictSeverity.of`, taking the tier and its sentence as one required value (#1126, `ConflictRowTreatmentTests`); the mode flip's reveal washes only on the explicit segment flip and mode-gated presence draws the reduced-strength accent frame from the site's own offer predicate at `.simple` (#760, `ModeGatedChromeTests`, `ModeGatedFrameSeparationTests`, `SettingsModeRevealTests`) — while a DURABLE marking and a TRANSIENT pointer state never share a property, separated by what they answer rather than by degree, since a hover on the marking's own channel erases the marking of the card it points at (#1173, `HomeCardChromeTests`); every colour comes from `SettingsTheme` and every declared token is either wired at a named render site or deferred with a reason (`SettingsThemeTokenTests`, `SettingsThemeWiringTests`); a fixed hue, RGB literal or fixed white/black outside `SettingsRawColorTests`' reasoned maps is banned (on the fixed-dark chrome families `SettingsFixedGroundTests` bans hierarchical greys AND ambient-inked controls, since a ground that does not move with the appearance needs an ink that does not either — a new such ground joining its stem list in the same change), a new drawn ink/surface pairing joins `SettingsThemeContrastTests`' list in the same change, and a dark plane meeting a dark ground takes the `planeRing` seam — by the token, never a `colorScheme` branch — the accent marks control fills, never text naming a value, so a control style that colours its label from the tint owes a counted neutralisation — menus pair `neutralMenuLabel()` per call site, a `.bordered` action button takes the `settingsActionButton()` seal, an accent-filled button takes the `kiwiProminentButton()` seal because `.borderedProminent` picks white (`SettingsButtonStyleConventionTests` counts both), and a raw `.bordered` is legal only via `SettingsBorderedSealTests`' `borderedExempt`, whose entries name the source token that IS each exemption's reason; and `Color.accentColor` is retired because it ignores `.tint`; what a narrowing window sheds is ruled in ORDER — the preview's column, then the row axis, then the header chrome, and controls never — with the thresholds and the bands owned by `SettingsWidthClass` alone, its shared ones derived from each other rather than re-tested (`SettingsResponsiveOrderTests`), a capability may lose its layout but never its reachability (`SettingsPreviewForm` is total; a movable card is clamped by arithmetic), the row axis has one application site that swaps `AnyLayout` rather than subtrees (`SettingsRowShapeTests`' `allowed` map is the one copy of who may), and a component that changes KIND stays one view; naming a control for VoiceOver REPLACES what it announced — so a NAMED control is VALUED in the same change (#812, `AnnouncedValueTests`' census is the one copy of who is labelled; `AppRulesCensusRenderTests` pins the two facet menus) — and a control labelled by a sibling `Text` has no name at all, a row's context menu routes through the one `rowActions` seam — right-click, VoiceOver actions and the focus-gated keyboard chord from ONE builder, never a bare channel beside it (`KeyboardActionParityTests`) — and every shape change states a focus destination that is always drawn AND able to hold focus, verified with macOS keyboard navigation on — stated ONLY when the platform would have moved focus itself, never suppressed at the ring, with the input source recorded once where every navigation already passes rather than re-read at the statement, which runs after the event is gone (#991, `SettingsInputSourceSeamTests`), and a shell statement hung on the view that OUTLIVES the transition rather than the one it builds (#996); a picture speaks as ONE description read from the drawing's own predicates (`KeyboardBoardSpokenTests`); and a title component carries `.isHeader`; and a window that finishes something ALREADY BEGUN comes forward at the moment it appears — one a framework opened included, through the seam that names that moment rather than a nearby callback, refusing any affordance that parks it out of reach, while an unsolicited OFFER takes the opposite rule; the guard pins the WIRING beside the override body or the override goes dead unnoticed — a separate suite, since the one reading what the override declares cannot see what it is wired to (#1011, `UpdatePromptWiringTests`); and the marked own window's raise goes through `KiwiCore.focusOwnWindow(number:)` BEFORE `forceFront`, so its report arrives intended rather than as the clickless focus #1161's distrust bounces — the gate and the window-number bridge are Core's, this tree never spells the verb, and `SettingsOpenFocusSeamTests`' `allowed` map is the one copy of who may call the door (#1281) |
| `Localization`, `Resources/Locales`, `scripts/*key*` | [localization.md](.claude/rules/localization.md) | Never hand-edit a catalog — the scripts own them; only catalogs live in the catalog directory (worksheets go to `locale-worksheets/`, and a stray one is rejected, never skipped); a re-mint never silently discards drafted work (`LocaleWorksheetCarryTests`, `LocaleWorksheetDiscardTests`, `LocaleWorksheetRefusalTests`) and the two scripts' decoders answer alike (`LocaleWorksheetDecodeParityTests`); positional specifiers only, and an interpolated value never has to AGREE with the sentence it lands in — an adjective or a cased noun takes a key per resulting sentence, stated rather than guarded, the sub-class held being #1110's four track rows (`TrackRowSentenceTests`) — and a frame whose argument the GUI may render EMPTY registers that key in `WITHHELD_ARGUMENTS` so the specifier stays last (`LocalizationWithheldArgumentTests`); content guards with no exemption file; a frame interpolating a count puts the number last so no locale has to agree with it, English included; Core names, the GUI narrates (#96); a destination label is a card title, a back-chip heading and a search row at once — keep it a short noun, shortened with the whole meaning intact; a `▸` breadcrumb names each segment as that locale itself renders it; English prose naming a pane, a button or a role interpolates that label's key rather than quoting it as text (#818, `InterpolatedLabelTests`), and spends each specifier once — review's, not that suite's; and one concept takes one word per catalog, settled by [localization-naming.md](docs/localization-naming.md) ▸ Family C's ladder — no content-guard predicate can hold it, the exact-collision sub-class is `DestinationNameCollisionTests`', and where rule 1 takes the word a site needed the escape is ranked too, its first step being to check the DESTINATION label is faithful rather than to coin a second noun |

| `site/**` | [site.md](.claude/rules/site.md) | `{/* */}` not `<!-- -->` — template comments ship to visitors (#557); `site/.nvmrc` is the one Node pin and never a second file; configure Cloudflare Pages in the repo, not the dashboard — save the **build watch paths**, which `wrangler.toml` cannot hold, so an input the site build gains outside `site/` moves the include list in the same change set, and the include is written `site/*` because Cloudflare's wildcard already crosses `/`; `src/pages/404.astro` and `disable404Route` move together (#635); `src/data/changelog.json` and `public/appcast.xml` are generated — by `scripts/changelog-sync` and `scripts/appcast-sync`, in one workflow into one PR so the notes and the update feed cannot describe different releases — and never hand-edited; the published release body is an input contract `changelog-sync`'s parser refuses rather than half-renders, every refusal and every must-not-refuse pinned by `ChangelogParserTests` (#873), while `appcast-sync` refuses an item on clauses of its own (`AppcastParserTests`) and `scripts/check-site-tokens.py` holds that the built feed is still served at the URL every build bakes in (#874); the docs remark plugin rides `markdown.processor` with `@astrojs/markdown-remark` declared, never the deprecated `markdown.remarkPlugins` array, and the BUILT pages are the guard — one `<h1>` each, no site-relative `.md` href, every site-relative href resolving (#985, `scripts/check-site-tokens.py` ▸ `check_markdown_pipeline`); a promoted download link is read off the release's own asset list rather than composed from a version (#904, `ChangelogDownloadTests`), a download link renders only where that field is present — the promoting pages link the newest recorded image and no built page names one the data does not record, two different tests because the changelog offers each release its own (`check-site-tokens.py` ▸ `check_promoted_download`, on the site gate because `CiPathFilterTests` refuses the other placement) — while an affordance is omitted outright rather than DIMMED, and prose naming a download is gated with it or written to stand alone: both of those are review's, since a dimmed control carries no URL for a guard to see and nothing reads prose; a path joins `sitemap.xml.ts`'s `paths` only once its `/de/` and `/ja/` routes exist; and every site catalog carries every key `en.json` has (`extract-keys --site --check`), which the app corpus deliberately does not require because only the site has no per-call-site English fallback (#869) |

When a recurring mistake is found, add it to the **rule file**
that owns the subsystem and refresh that row here — never write
the rationale into both.

**Write a rule as an obligation, not as a state claim (#614).**
An obligation can only be *violated*, which a review catches; an
absolute claim about the current tree is true only the day it is
written, and the commit that falsifies it is somewhere else, so
nothing notices. A claim that stays must name its enforcing guard
inline or be re-homed to one — the dispositions, ranked, and the
two rules about the guards themselves are in
[rule-authoring.md](.claude/rules/rule-authoring.md), which loads
when you edit a rule file.
