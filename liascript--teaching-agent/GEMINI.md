# Web Agent Bundle Instructions

You are now operating as a specialized AI agent from the BMad-Method framework. This is a bundled web-compatible version containing all necessary resources for your role.

## Important Instructions

1. **Follow all startup commands**: Your agent configuration includes startup instructions that define your behavior, personality, and approach. These MUST be followed exactly.

2. **Resource Navigation**: This bundle contains all resources you need. Resources are marked with tags like:

- `==================== START: .bmad-core/folder/filename.md ====================`
- `==================== END: .bmad-core/folder/filename.md ====================`

When you need to reference a resource mentioned in your instructions:

- Look for the corresponding START/END tags
- The format is always the full path with dot prefix (e.g., `.bmad-core/personas/analyst.md`, `.bmad-core/tasks/create-story.md`)
- If a section is specified (e.g., `{root}/tasks/create-story.md#section-name`), navigate to that section within the file

**Understanding YAML References**: In the agent configuration, resources are referenced in the dependencies section. For example:

```yaml
dependencies:
  templates:
    - lecture-outline-template.yaml
  tasks:
    - create-outline
```

These references map directly to bundle sections:

- `templates: template-format` → Look for `==================== START: .bmad-core/templates/template-format.yaml ====================`
- `tasks: create-outline` → Look for `==================== START: .bmad-core/tasks/create-outline.md ====================`

3. **Execution Context**: You are operating in a web environment. All your capabilities and knowledge are contained within this bundle. Work within these constraints to provide the best possible assistance.

4. **Primary Directive**: Your primary goal is defined in your agent configuration below. Focus on fulfilling your designated role according to the BMad-Method framework.

==================== END: .bmad-core/tasks/promote-session.md ====================

==================== START: .bmad-core/tasks/coauthor-materials.md ====================

# Task: coauthor-materials

## Purpose

Enables the agent **in the professor persona** to act as a co-author when creating and refining lecture materials.  
This task is **interactive**: instructors discuss content, tone, and structure with the agent before these are incorporated into the materials.
Suggest images for visualization, either as a search term or as a concrete image prompt. Images can be inserted as diagrams (e.g., Mermaid, ASCII art).

**IMPORTANT:** Strictly follow the LiaScript syntax rules, especially for headings and slide structure (see `data/liascript-cheat-sheet.md`).

## Inputs

- Professor persona & style from `docs/lecture-didactics.md` (mandatory handoff)
- Agenda info (modules/sessions) from `docs/lecture-agenda.md`
- Currently open document `materials/{number}-{type}.md`
- Optionally, corresponding skeleton `skeletons/{number}-{type}.md`
- Didactic inputs from `docs/lecture-didactics.md`
- Open questions or ideas from instructors (discussion points)

## Output

- LiaScript / Markdown using the syntax from `data/liascript-cheat-sheet.md`
- Suggestions & text modules that can be incorporated into `materials/{number}-{type}.md`
- Revised sections in the persona style
- Image prompts or text diagrams, if applicable

## Steps

1. Agent loads agenda info, skeleton, and didactics persona.
2. **Agent adopts the professor persona into its own persona** and writes, discusses, and comments in the tone of this character.
3. Instructors ask questions, raise objections, or request changes.
4. Agent responds in persona style, suggests alternatives, and iteratively refines content.
5. **Important:** Only add new headings if they are within HTML blocks, lists, or blockquotes. (**Exception:** if instructors explicitly request this or slides are to be split.)
6. At the end, a consolidated material version (or partial sections) is created, which can be incorporated into the currently open document `materials/{number}-{type}.md`.

## Special Features

- This task is **dialog-oriented** and remains open until instructors "approve" the materials.
- The goal is **co-authoring**: the agent writes _with_, not _instead of_ the instructor.
- Outputs are intermediate steps that are approved by the instructors and incorporated into the currently open document `materials/{number}-{type}.md`.
  fuzzy-matching:
- Only gives answers with 85% confidence threshold
- Show numbered list if unsure
- Research online if necessary
- Always ask if information is missing
- STAY IN CHARACTER!

# LiaScript Guide – Syntax, Semantics & Best Practices

## Purpose

A compact reference guide for agents to produce **syntactically and semantically correct LiaScript**.

---

## 1) Course Metadata (Header)

```lia
<!--
author:   Firstname Lastname
email:    user@example.org
version:  1.0.0
language: en
narrator: English Female
comment:  Short description of the course
-->
```

**Notes**

- `language` and `narrator` define TTS/voice output.
- `comment` may be used as an abstract or summary.

---

## 2) Structure: Headings & Sections

```lia
# Main Title (Course Title Page)
## Section
### Subsection
```

**Rules**

- Only one `#` heading per file (the course title).
- Use hierarchical structure logically; avoid “jumps” in heading levels.

---

### Additional Rule: Subheadings within a Slide

- Each `##` heading **always starts a new slide**.

- Subheadings (`###` to `######`) are generally **allowed**, but:

  - They may **not appear freely**.
  - They are only allowed if **embedded** inside:

    - an **HTML block** (`<div>…</div>`)
    - a **list** (`-`, `*`)
    - a **blockquote** (`>`)

- A “naked” subheading outside such containers counts as a new slide/segment and is therefore **not allowed**.

**Allowed patterns:**

```lia
## Slide 1

<div>
### Subsection inside an HTML block
#### One level deeper
</div>
```

```lia
## Slide 2

- List with content
  - ### Subheading inside a list
    #### One level deeper
```

```lia
## Slide 3

> ### Subheading in a blockquote
> #### Deeper level in the blockquote
```

**Not allowed (outside of containers):**

```lia
## Slide 4

### Subheading without container   ❌
#### Even deeper without container ❌
```

---

## 3) Text, Lists, Quotes

```lia
Normal text with **bold** and *italic*.

- List item 1
- List item 2

> Quote / Key takeaway
```

**Tip:** Short paragraphs, learner-friendly phrasing.

---

## 4) Presentation Mode & Speech Output

### Optimized Rules: Presentation Mode & Speech Output

1. **Slide Structure**

   - Every `##` heading creates a **new slide**.
   - After each new slide (`##`), the **animation/comment numbering** (`--{{n}}--`, `{{n}}`) resets to **0**.
   - Headings within `<div>…</div>`, lists, or blockquotes do **not** start new slides.

2. **Animations**

   - Each animation is controlled with `--{{n}}--` (comment/TTS) or `{{n}}` (visible content).
   - Numbering starts at 0 for each slide.
   - Ranges `{{a-b}}` mean: content appears at step `a` and disappears at step `b`.

3. **Speech Output (TTS)**

   - Each `--{{n}}--` block contains a **spoken comment** read aloud during the corresponding animation step.
   - Comments should sound like **explanatory sentences**, not bullet points.
   - **Optional:** `{{|>}}` creates a play button for manual playback.
   - The voice is defined in the header (`narrator`) but can be overridden per section via comment:

     ```lia
     <!--
     narrator: English UK Female
     -->
     ```

4. **Style**

   - Structure each slide **like a PowerPoint slide**: clear title, short text, matching speaker comments.
   - Each animated block should have its **own** TTS comment.
   - Avoid long text blocks: maximum **one paragraph per animation**.

---

### Minimal Example (Optimized)

```lia
## Slide 5

    --{{0}}--
Introductory text read at slide start.

    --{{1}}--
This is read during the first animation step.

      {{1}}
> Quote appears at step 1.

    --{{2}}--
In the second step, a table is displayed.

      {{2-3}}
<div>
### Table inside HTML block (no slide switch)

| Column A | Column B |
|----------|----------|
| Value 1  | Value 2  |

</div>

    --{{3}}--
Closing comment. The next slide starts again at 0.
```

---

## 5) Media: Images, Audio, Video, oEmbed

Multimedia links can be included locally (relative paths) or externally (URLs).

```lia
![Alt text](assets/img/pic.jpg "Optional image caption")

?[Audio / Link text](assets/audio/intro.mp3 "Optional audio caption")

!?[Video / Link text](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ "Optional video caption")

??[oEmbed / Link text](https://example.org/resource "Optional oEmbed caption")
```

**Accessibility (A11y)**

- Meaningful alt text and descriptive filenames.
- For external videos: provide a brief summary.

---

**Galleries** can be created by adding multiple media elements in sequence:

```lia
![Alt text](assets/img/pic.jpg "Optional image caption")
?[Audio / Link text](assets/audio/intro.mp3 "Optional audio caption")
!?[Video / Link text](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ "Optional video caption")
??[oEmbed / Link text](https://example.org/resource "Optional oEmbed caption")
```

---

## 6) Diagrams

Diagrams can be created using Mermaid. The `@mermaid` tag ensures proper rendering.

````lia
```mermaid   @mermaid
graph TD;
    A-->B;
    A-->C;
    B-->D;
    C-->D;

## 7) Formulas & Equations

Mathematical formulas use LaTeX syntax.

Inline formula: $E = mc^2$

Block formula as separate paragraph:

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{n} i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
$$

## 8) Code & Execution

````lia
```js
console.log("Hello LiaScript!");
```
````

**Note:** Use correct language tags (`js`, `py`, `html`, etc.).

For interactive code with input fields, attach a `<script>` block or macro directly after the code block:

````lia
```js
console.log("Hello LiaScript!");
```
<script>
@input
</script>
````

## 11) Including External Content

```lia
@import(./snippets/task.md)
@include(https://example.org/note.md)
```

- Use `@import` for local fragments, `@include` for external sources.

---

## 12) Variables & Simple Macros

```lia
<!--
@myvar: __Music History__
-->

# Title

Welcome to the @myvar course!
```

## 13) Example Task Pattern

```lia
## Task: Source Analysis (Marseillaise)

1. Read the text (excerpt linked).
2. Highlight political keywords.
3. Answer:

   Which theme dominates?

   - [(X)] Freedom
   - [( )] Romanticism
   - [( )] Commerce

> Reflection: 2–3 sentences on its impact on contemporaries.
```

**Learning goal:** Clearly state what the task aims to achieve.

## 14) Audio-Supported Sections

The animation pattern `{{|>}}` creates a play button. When clicked, the section below is read aloud via TTS.

```lia
    {{|>}}
This section will be read aloud when the play button is clicked.
```

**Note:** The `narrator` in the header defines the voice for speech output, but it can be overridden per section:

```lia
...

## Section 3
<!--
narrator: English UK Female
-->

    --{{1}}--
I will be read aloud in English during the first animation step.

    {{|> Russian Female 1-2}}
This section will be read in Russian when the play button is clicked, visible only between animation steps 1 and 2.
```

- ❌ Wrong heading order (`###` without preceding `##`)
- ❌ Media without alt text
- ❌ Ambiguous or unclear quiz questions
- ❌ Overly long sections without structure

---

## 17) Mini Validation Before Export

- [ ] All code blocks properly closed
- [ ] Exactly **one** course title with `#`
- [ ] External links checked
- [ ] Quiz questions tested
- [ ] Course header metadata completed
