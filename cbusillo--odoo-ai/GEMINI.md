# AGENTS.md — Retired Odoo Runtime Guide

This repo is retired for live Odoo runtime work. Keep it available for archival
reference only, and use `odoo-devkit`, tenant repos, and generated Odoo
workspaces for current runtime/build/deploy work unless the user explicitly asks
to inspect retired `odoo-ai` history.

## Historical Codex CLI Operating Guide

Treat this file as the launch checklist for every Codex session. Skim it, open
the linked docs, then keep prompts lean.

## Start Here

- Use the documentation table of contents (`docs/README.md`) to grab handles
  instead of copying long excerpts.
- Platform entrypoint: `uv run platform` for up/down/init/restore/build/ship/
  gate workflows (docs `docs/tooling/platform-cli.md`; implementation
  `tools/platform/cli.py`).
- Before changing code, open the matching style page (`docs/style/python.md`, `docs/style/javascript.md`,
  `docs/style/testing.md`).
- Clarify your role expectations with @docs/roles.md (analyst, engineer,
  tester, reviewer, maintainer).

## Project Snapshot

- Custom addons live under `./addons/`; host `./` maps to container `/volumes/`.
- We target Odoo 19 Enterprise. Never edit generated GraphQL artifacts
  (`addons/shopify_sync/services/shopify/gql/*`,
  `addons/shopify_sync/graphql/schema/*`).
- Always go through `uv run ...`; the Odoo environment must bootstrap every
  command (tests, scripts, shell helpers).
- Never call the system Python directly; use `uv run python ...` (or the
  scripted helpers) so the managed env stays in sync.
- Common helper entry points are defined in `[project.scripts]` inside
  `pyproject.toml` (examples: `test`, `platform`). Prefer them over ad-hoc
  commands and suggest additions when a useful script is missing.
- GPT service users seed automatically during restores when `.env` defines
  `ODOO_KEY`; see `docs/tooling/gpt-service-user.md` for provisioning details
  and API key usage.
- When you need multi-line scratch code, save it under `tmp/scripts/` and run
  `uv run python tmp/scripts/<name>.py` so the `uv run` sandbox bypass applies
  and you can iterate without heredocs.

## Version Guardrails (Odoo 19 + Owl 2)

- Views: use `<list>` roots, not `<tree>`.
- Views: use `invisible`/`readonly`/`required` and `column_invisible`; avoid
  legacy `attrs`/`states`.
- Frontend: native ESM only (`@web/...`, `@odoo/...`); no `odoo.define`.
- Frontend: do not add `/** @odoo-module */` in new files.

## Operating Guardrails

- Zero-warning + full-test acceptance gate: follow
  `docs/policies/acceptance-gate.md` and gate with `uv run test run --json`.
- Respect `docs/policies/coding-standards.md` and
  `docs/policies/doc-style.md` for naming, formatting, and docs-as-code.
- Naming guardrail: avoid abbreviations and 1–2 letter locals (e.g., `idx`,
  `cfg`, `tmp`, `obj`, `val`, `res`, `ctx`). Allow only explicit, well-known
  tokens (`id`, `db`, `api`, `orm`, `env`, `io`, `url`, `ui`, `ux`, `ip`,
  `http`, `json`, `xml`, `sql`) and math-only contexts.
- Update relevant docs in the same change when behavior shifts; link handles
  rather than pasting large snippets.
- Preserve history (`git mv`, minimal diffs) and avoid destructive git actions
  unless the operator explicitly directs them.
- Fix root causes, not symptoms: do not introduce workaround-only changes,
  temporary fallbacks, or bypasses unless the operator explicitly asks for a
  time-boxed mitigation.
- If production/runtime behavior is broken, pause and diagnose first. Before
  changing config/code, summarize the root cause hypothesis, validation steps,
  and intended permanent fix.
- Prefer fail-closed over silent degradation: if the right fix is blocked
  (credentials, infrastructure, missing access), stop and report the blocker
  clearly instead of masking it with alternate behavior.
- Never commit secret or operator-local env overrides (for example `.env`,
  `.platform/env/*.env`, `platform/secrets.toml`). Tracked
  templates/defaults like `.env.example` and `platform/config/base.env` are
  intended to be committed and must stay non-secret.
- For non-trivial work, prefer small checkpoint commits after each validated
  logical slice. Use those checkpoints as the base for review work so isolated
  follow-up fixes can be merged or `cherry-pick`-ed instead of manually
  re-applied. Keep commits coherent rather than per-turn, do not amend unless
  the operator explicitly asks, and fall back to manual porting when the
  checkout is too dirty or the review diff overlaps unrelated changes.
- Keep branch/worktree hygiene per @docs/roles.md: remove Code-created
  branches and temporary worktrees once merged or abandoned, and prune stale
  refs/worktrees as you go.

## Workflow Loop

- The working loop (plan → patch → inspect → targeted tests → iterate → gate)
  is spelled out in `docs/workflows/codex-workflow.md`.
- Use `docs/TESTING.md` to scope and shard tests via JSON summaries.
- Open the matching workflow playbook before deeper work:
  `docs/workflows/refactor.md`, `docs/workflows/debugging.md`,
  `docs/workflows/multi-project.md`, and `docs/workflows/prod-deploy.md`.

## Proactive Improvements

- Proactively suggest small environment or tooling improvements when you notice
  friction (scripts, config, runtime baselines); keep suggestions brief and
  link to the relevant docs (e.g., `docs/tooling/platform-cli.md`,
  `docs/tooling/runtime-baselines.md`, `docs/tooling/dokploy.md`).
- Let the operator decide; don’t apply environment changes without explicit
  approval.
- If guidance is missing, suggest updates to the relevant docs instead of
  expanding AGENTS.md.

## Testing & Scripts

- Reuse the scripted helpers in `pyproject.toml` to run tests, lint, or
  maintenance tasks (e.g., `uv run test unit`, `uv run test plan --phase all`).
- `docs/TESTING.md` summarizes the recommended commands and filtering flags;
  `docs/tooling/testing-cli.md` documents detached mode, sharding, and JSON
  outputs.
- Python formatting and linting commands live in `docs/style/python.md`; JS/Owl
  specifics live in `docs/style/javascript.md` and `docs/style/testing.md`.

## Tooling Order

- Prefer Odoo Intelligence MCP calls for model/field discovery, code search, or
  module updates before falling back to ad-hoc shell commands
  (`docs/tooling/odoo-intelligence.md`).
- For browser-based validation, do not use `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` URLs.
  Use the host IP or the environment hostname (for example
  `cm-local.shinycomputers.com`) so the browser process can reach Odoo.
- For long-running or high-output commands (for example imports, restore,
  upgrade, large tests), run detached/in the background and redirect output to
  a log file under `tmp/` instead of streaming full output in-session.
  Streaming noisy output directly can destabilize Every Code, the TUI harness
  used for Codex sessions in this repo.
- Mirror the design style and patterns already established in
  `addons/opw_custom/`; align new modules and views with that reference
  before inventing new approaches.
- Run JetBrains inspections on changed scope and then git scope before the gate
  (`docs/tooling/inspection.md`).
- PyCharm 2026 note: the 261 build line has a known false-positive regression
  around `X | None` reassignment narrowing. When using 2026, check whether a
  newer build includes the upstream fix before trusting those warnings. If you
  are still on an affected 261 build, disable the Registry flag
  `python.typing.strict.unions` until JetBrains ships the fix in a public build.
- Use Codex built-ins for routine file reads/searches and `apply_patch`; reserve
  JetBrains automation for IDE-only tasks.
- Sandbox/approval profiles are documented in `docs/tooling/codex-cli.md`.
- Dokploy env edits should go through `uv run platform dokploy env-set` /
  `env-get` / `env-unset` instead of ad-hoc scripts.

## Domain Notes

- **Odoo core**: Batch ORM operations, respect security defaults, and stay
  within container paths. Review `docs/odoo/orm.md`, `docs/odoo/security.md`,
  `docs/odoo/performance.md`, and `docs/odoo/workflow.md` before touching models
  or access rules. Use `with_context(skip_shopify_sync=True)` when bulk
  operations risk syncing loops.
- **Odoo typing/imports**: Do not rely on `odoo.addons.<local_addon>` imports
  for local addon code; that path is not a supported contract here. Prefer
  magic types for typing (see `docs/style/python.md`) and use `self.env[...]`
  / `env[...]` for model access, for example `self.env["external.id"]`.
- **Frontend & Tours**: Keep selectors simple and avoid jQuery-style filters. See
  `docs/style/javascript.md`, `docs/style/browser-automation.md`, and
  `docs/style/testing.md`.
- **Integrations**: Shopify and GraphQL patterns live in
  `docs/integrations/`; service mocking is covered in
  `docs/style/testing.md`. Generated files stay untouched.

## Addons & External Code

- Addons live directly in this repo under `./addons/` (no submodules). If an
  addon needs to be shared externally, mirror or export it from this repo
  instead of embedding a submodule.
- Local stacks standardize project addons at `/opt/project/addons`. Prefer a
  separate worktree for isolated edits and commits, then bring ready
  commits/patches back to the main checkout for Docker-backed or local-stack
  validation.
  Worktrees usually do not carry the operator's local `.env`, generated
  `.platform/env/...` files, or local compose overrides by default. Only run a
  stack directly from a worktree when you intentionally provision that runtime
  as a separate parallel environment.

## Research & Citations

- Use web search when information may have changed (APIs, pricing, releases) or
  when you need citations. Default to primary sources.
- Cite unstable facts inline using the Codex CLI citation format; never drop
  raw URLs in summaries.

## Reference Handles You’ll Reuse

- Architecture: `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/resources.md`
- Testing patterns & advanced topics: `docs/style/testing.md`,
  `docs/TESTING.md`
- Performance & bulk operations: `docs/odoo/performance.md`, `docs/odoo/orm.md`
- Planning & estimation: `docs/workflows/codex-workflow.md`
- Environment utilities: restore helpers in `tools/`
  (use `uv run platform restore --context <ctx> --instance <instance>` or
  `uv run platform bootstrap --context <ctx> --instance <instance>`)

Keep AGENTS.md thin: route deeper guidance to the linked pages so we maintain a
single, accurate source of truth.
