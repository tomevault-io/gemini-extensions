# AGENTS (Mixlyzer)

Working notes for AI/automation agents editing the Mixlyzer codebase.

## Run & Environment
- Python 3.12+.
- Dependency management uses `uv`.
- Install deps with `uv sync`.
- Launch the app with `uv run python -m app.main`.
- Keep root-level `config.json` available. `load_cfg()` reads and rewrites it.
- Keep root-level `ffmpeg.exe` available on Windows, or provide FFmpeg on `PATH` for `core/audio/decoder.py`.
- Do not run the app as administrator on Windows; `app/main.py` explicitly blocks it.

## Repo Map
- `app/`: Qt entrypoint and top-level window wiring.
  - `main.py`: app bootstrap, dark palette, font loading, library-version migration flow.
  - `window.py`: `AppWindow`, worker orchestration, EventBus wiring, External Sync, metronome, model updates.
- `core/`: shared runtime/state/integration layer.
  - `config.py`: dataclass config schema, defaults, `load_cfg()`.
  - `model.py`: shared `DataModel` and `GlobalParams`.
  - `event_bus.py`: Qt signal hub.
  - `analysis_worker.py`: subprocess wrapper for full-track analysis.
  - `segment_reanalysis_manager.py` / `segment_reanalysis_worker.py`: subprocess-based partial reanalysis.
  - `library_handler.py`: SQLite metadata store plus BPM/key segment tables and transition search.
  - `analysis_lib_handler.py`: NPZ feature store keyed by track UID.
  - `external_sync.py`: memory-based external deck sync / transport lockout.
  - `player.py`, `timeline.py`, `taskmanager.py`: playback, viewport timeline, worker/task UI state.
  - `audio/`: decode + low-level audio helpers.
- `analyzer_core/`: DSP and editor-side reanalysis algorithms.
  - `global_analyzer.py`: full analysis pipeline and persistence handoff.
  - `beat/`: BPM / beatgrid analysis.
  - `key/`: chroma/key analysis.
  - `self_correlation/`: JumpCUE detection.
  - `editor/`: beatgrid, key, JumpCUE reanalysis helpers used by worker subprocesses.
- `ui/`: Qt widgets/dialogs.
  - `pane.py`: `MainPane` composition.
  - `library.py`: library table, search, transition search, export/reanalyze/edit actions.
  - `beatgrid_edit_panel.py`, `edit_song.py`, `export.py`, `cfgwindow.py`, `workers.py`: editing/export/settings/task dialogs.
- `views/`: pyqtgraph view plugins registered through `views.base.REGISTRY`.
- `utils/`: labels, colors, fonts, JumpCUE extraction/render helpers, keystrip utilities, waveform helpers.
- `third_party/`: export adapters such as Rekordbox XML generation.
- `migration/`: library schema/version migrations.
- `build/`: PyInstaller spec.
- `docs/`: localized docs (`README.ko.md`, `README.ja.md`).
- `assets/`: icons, fonts, sounds.
- `library/`: user library data directory created/used at runtime. Treat as user data.
- `debug/`: generated debug artifacts; do not assume they are source assets.

## App Flow
- Entry is `app.main:main()`.
- On startup the app:
  - loads `config.json`,
  - ensures the library directory exists,
  - checks `library/VERSION`,
  - runs migration steps from `migration/` if the on-disk library version is behind `CURRENT_LIBRARY_VERSION`,
  - creates and shows `AppWindow`.
- `AppWindow` creates the shared `EventBus`, `DataModel`, `TimelineCoordinator`, `PlayerController`, `ExternalSyncController`, `SegmentReanalysisManager`, and `MainPane`.
- UI state is mostly signal-driven. Feature/property/album-art signals are notifications only; listeners read current values from the shared `DataModel`.

## Analysis Flow
- Track load requests enter through `EventBus.sig_request_load_track` and end up in `AppWindow.analyze_file()`.
- Full-track analysis runs in a spawned subprocess via `core.analysis_worker.AnalysisWorker`.
- The worker calls `analyzer_core.global_analyzer.precompute_features(...)`.
- Current pipeline in `global_analyzer.py`:
  - decode/load audio,
  - optional HPSS split,
  - low/mid/high envelope extraction plus waveform min/max buffers,
  - BPM / beatgrid analysis,
  - beatgrid offset application,
  - JumpCUE detection,
  - beat-synchronous chroma extraction,
  - key analysis,
  - GUI-buffer normalization via `core.adapters.normalize_gui_buffers`,
  - persistence to SQLite (`LibraryDB`) and NPZ (`FeatureNPZStore`).
- Cached-track loads can skip analysis and load metadata/features directly from `library.db` + NPZ.
- Reanalyze-track requests (`sig_reanalyze_requested`) force a fresh full analysis and overwrite stored results.

## Segment Reanalysis
- Partial reanalysis is orchestrated by `core.segment_reanalysis_manager.SegmentReanalysisManager`.
- Work is offloaded to a subprocess via `SegmentReanalysisWorker`.
- Supported modes currently include:
  - beat segment reanalysis,
  - static key selection reanalysis,
  - dynamic full key reanalysis,
  - JumpCUE reanalysis.
- Results are pushed back into the in-memory `DataModel` and editor widgets; they are not a separate analysis system.

## Data & Persistence
- Track metadata lives in `library/library.db` in the `tracks` table.
- BPM and key transitions are also persisted in:
  - `track_bpm_segments`
  - `track_key_segments`
- Numeric feature arrays live in `{libpath}/{uid}.npz` through `FeatureNPZStore`.
- Track identity across DB and NPZ is the `uid` field stored in SQLite.
- `DataModel` holds the live in-memory track state:
  - `features`
  - `properties`
  - `duration_sec`
  - `gp`
  - `album_art`
  - optional predecoded audio buffers

## UI Notes
- `ui.pane.MainPane` owns the top-level plot stack, overview, track info, transport controls, editor panel, and library widget.
- Analysis views are plugin-like classes from `views/` instantiated via `REGISTRY`.
- Enabled views come from `viewconfig`:
  - waveform
  - beatgrid
  - keystrip
  - JumpCUE
- `ui.library.LibraryWidget` is not just a browser:
  - it performs text search,
  - transition search using DB segment tables,
  - remove/reanalyze/edit/export actions.
- `ui.export.ExportTrackDialog` prefers the in-memory `DataModel` for the currently loaded track and falls back to NPZ when needed.

## External Sync
- `core.external_sync.ExternalSyncController` can follow an external process via memory reads using `pymem`.
- When enabled, local playback/load controls are intentionally restricted.
- Process denylist lives in `process_denylist.json`.
- If you touch External Sync config or behavior, keep `core/config.py`, `ui/cfgwindow.py`, and `app/window.py` aligned.

## Change Guidelines
- Keep heavy DSP, file IO, and long-running work off the GUI thread.
- Worker subprocess entry points must remain module-level pickleable callables. Do not pass Qt objects into multiprocessing workers.
- When changing config shape/defaults:
  - update dataclasses in `core/config.py`,
  - update `default_cfg()`,
  - keep `config.json` compatibility in mind,
  - update `ui/cfgwindow.py`,
  - update any call sites assuming the old fields.
- When changing persisted analysis outputs:
  - preserve compatibility with `normalize_gui_buffers`,
  - update readers in `DataModel`/UI/views,
  - update DB segment adapters in `core.linear_segments` if segment schema changes,
  - consider migration needs for existing libraries.
- `library/` is user data. Do not delete, reset, or commit its contents.
- Preserve `uid` linkage between SQLite and NPZ when editing library code.
- Prefer contiguous NumPy arrays where practical; several rendering and DSP paths assume NumPy-friendly numeric buffers.
- Keep Qt signal semantics stable. Many slots expect notification-only signals and then read shared model state.
- If you change view registration or naming, update `views.base.REGISTRY` consumers accordingly.

## Build / Packaging
- PyInstaller spec is `build/mixlyzer.spec`.
- Current spec definitely includes `config.json`.
- Asset and `ffmpeg.exe` bundling are presently commented out in the spec, so do not assume packaging already includes them.
- There is no active `installer/` directory in this repo snapshot; do not document or depend on one unless you add it.

## Safe Assumptions
- The codebase is Windows-first, but much of the Python code is portable.
- The library format is versioned; old docs that ignore migration are outdated.
- Root `README.md` exists, but localized docs currently live under `docs/`.
