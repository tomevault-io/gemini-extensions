> **Division of labor:** `AGENTS.md` holds engineering **do-not-revisit guardrails** — the hard constraints touching window identity, placement, taskbar trust, card identity, and input mechanism. A UX feature earns a section here **only once it hardens into such a constraint** (e.g. native-tab single-seat, strip drag-reorder); each entry stays terse and points to Obsidian for the full rationale + reversal log. Pure product surface with no engine-level constraint (badge styling, drawer copy, hover labels) stays **Obsidian-only**. Obsidian remains the source of truth for product state, decisions, and roadmap. Dated `Docs/*` are historical records, not live status — except `Docs/05-known-platform-quirks.md`, kept current as repo-local engineering reference.

## Purpose

This repo is `v2` of a macOS window-oriented bottom taskbar experiment. The foundation-engine phase is done; current work is in the UX feature layer tracked in Obsidian (see top of file). Do not rebuild the Finder foundation or return to bottom-up "every CG/AX window-like surface" discovery — these were deliberately replaced by the inventory-first model in Taskbar Trust and should not be reintroduced.

## Product Rules

### Placement

- Minimize does **not** release a slot.
- Hide does **not** release a slot.
- Temporary `CG` disappearance does **not** release a slot.
- Only true close releases a slot.

Do not reintroduce held-slot TTL or "expire then return to tail" as the default placement rule.

### Feishu

- Feishu window-level handling is opportunistic.
- If frontmost AX windows are unreliable, titles are generic, or titles are missing, Feishu may fall back to a single stable app-level item.
- Do not block the taskbar mainline on perfect Feishu per-window fidelity.
- For current V2 validation, a stable app-level Feishu fallback is sufficient; real frontmost AX samples are future window-level enhancement evidence, not a blocker.

### Finder

- Finder always has a persistent slot in the taskbar: `seedRunningApps` adds Finder unconditionally so its chip survives even when all windows are closed.
- When all Finder windows are closed the slot shows as an `app-com.apple.finder` chip. Clicking it opens the home directory in a new Finder window (mirrors system Dock behavior). This is intentional app-level persistence, not an AX fallback.
- Do not plan a `hideApp`/minimize action for the Finder persistent (`app-*`) chip on toggle — always plan activate/open, even when Finder is still frontmost right after its last window closes.
- Do not let the dead-process reconcile sweep remove Finder's app entry — `handleAppTerminated` clears its windows but keeps the slot, and reconcile must skip Finder when sweeping dead pids.

Both fixed 2026-06-16; full rationale documented in Obsidian `03 设计决策` ("Finder 持久图标").
- Finder process existence alone does **not** mean there is a Finder window.
- Concrete Finder folder windows should remain window-level items when titles / frames are available.
- Do not fall back to activating the whole Finder app when a specific Finder window target cannot be captured; that can bring forward the wrong Finder window or multiple windows.
- Finder P0 implementation details are documented in `Docs/17-finder-p0-implementation.md`.
- Finder real sample findings are documented in `Docs/18-real-sample-finder-findings.md`.
- Finder minimize feedback treats either `minimized` or temporary `disappeared` observation as success, because macOS can report a minimized concrete Finder window through either path.

### Taskbar Trust

- Only trusted, user-operable windows should enter the bottom strip.
- System internals, widgets, app extensions, transparent windows, and other fake window-like surfaces must be filtered before they can benefit from keep-slot or `disappeared` retention.
- Do not widen `AX` sampling again without strict window-type filtering and an observation-count guardrail.
- The current trust model starts from app-level window inventory: `WorkspaceSource` enumerates normal user apps through `NSWorkspace`, reads their `AXWindows`, and emits `.appWindowInventory` observations.
- Inventory reads use a 100ms per-app AX messaging timeout, up to 12 concurrent app reads, and a 30-round unread degradation threshold. Once an app is degraded, `CG` may help decide whether its windows still exist.
- `CG` and generic `.accessibility` observations should not create ordinary new strip entries while inventory-first is available. They should prove or enrich entries from inventory, except for documented Finder and Feishu rules.
- If AX permission is unavailable, `CG` fallback may still create entries so the app remains useful in reduced-permission mode.
- Debug rollback flags exist for local diagnosis: `DOCK_INVENTORY_FIRST_ENABLED=0` or `DOCK_AX_ADMISSION_MODE=legacy`.
- The 2026-05-07 trust incident is documented in `Docs/19-taskbar-trust-incident.md`.
- The inventory-first implementation is documented in `Docs/20-inventory-first-taskbar-trust.md`.

### Long-Gap Duplicate Cards

Root cause and full fix documented in `Docs/21-long-gap-duplicate-card-fix.md`. Current fix: before creating a new identity, match against the current `DockSnapshot` seats when the candidate is same process and same app. Matching is conservative — title + nearby frame preferred; ambiguous candidates do not merge; `app-*` IDs and `closedPending` records are never revived.

### Native Tab Groups & Stable Card Identity — single-seat model (Ghostty 根治)

> Empirically grounded (2026-06-19 spike): Finder **and** Ghostty native tab groups expose **only the active tab** as an eligible AX window; all tabs of one window share a pixel-identical frame; switching tabs **atomically swaps** which single cgID is AX-visible (no overlap, no gap). Safari "tabs" are in-app (one NSWindow per window). Ghostty minimized windows stay in AX (`min=true`); Safari minimized windows **leave AX entirely**.

- **Model: one physical window = one seat = one chip.** A `WindowEntry` is a **physical-window seat** with a stable `token` (`tabgrp-<pid>-s<serial>`, from a monotonic counter — **never derived from a cgID**, which gets reused and would collide) plus a current `cgWindowID` = the **active tab** (the action target, swaps as you switch tabs). Background tabs are **not** separate seats. `WindowRecord.id` is `cgw-<activeCgID>` but the chip's stable identity is `groupID = seat.token`; everything is contained in `AppTracker` — the external `DockSnapshot`/`WindowRecord` shape is unchanged.
- **Seat reconciliation (`AppTracker.reconcileSeats`)** maps each app's current eligible AX windows onto seats, frame-anchored, with these cases:
  - *Tab switch*: a seat's active cgID leaves AX and a new cgID appears at the **same frame** → seat adopts it in place (token unchanged → chip never jumps). Guarded: only if exactly one seat claims that frame (overlap ambiguity → don't adopt).
  - *Tear out the current tab*: the active cgID is still visible but moved to a **new** frame while another tab took its old frame → seat stays at the old frame and adopts the new tab; the moved cgID is **evicted** to a fresh seat (so the torn-out window gets its own chip).
  - *New window / torn-out background tab*: an eligible cgID matching no seat → new seat, new token.
  - *Minimize a multi-tab window*: minimizing makes Ghostty expose **all** the window's tabs as eligible AX windows at once (all `min=true`, **pixel-identical frame** — verified 2026-06-20), unlike the active-only exposure when not minimized. A `min=true` eligible window whose frame matches an already-placed seat is **folded** into that seat (background tab of the minimized window), not given its own seat — otherwise the chip splits into one-per-tab on minimize. A non-`min` same-frame window is instead two overlapping separate windows → kept separate.
- **Seat removal — minimize vs close (the hard distinction; both are "AX-absent + still in CG").** When a seat's active cgID leaves AX with no takeover:
  - If it was **minimized** (`seat.isMinimized`, latched via `kAXWindowMiniaturizedNotification`) **or** the app is hidden → keep the seat. This is why Safari-minimize (leaves AX) keeps its chip.
  - Else (a normal window that left AX) → it's a **close** whose NSWindow lingers in the CG list (Ghostty does this); keep for a short `closedReapGrace` (~1.5s, absorbs AX read misses) then drop. Do **not** force `isMinimized` while in this grace, or the close would masquerade as a minimize and never reap.
  - If the cgID is gone from the full CG list (or freshly `destroyed`) → drop immediately.
- **Superseded approaches — do not revisit:** (1) the 2026-06-17 "reap any AX-absent-but-CG-present seat after a grace" — falsified because Safari minimize leaves AX (killed real minimized windows). (2) the 2026-06-19 first cut "keep every tab as a seat + collapse by a stable token" — the token-inheritance/merge was fragile under tear-out (couldn't tell tear-out from switch/new-tab without guessing). The single-seat model removes the root (background-tab seats) instead of stitching grouping logic on top.
- **Order-layer stickiness (`StripOrderStore.rankRetentionGrace` ~5s)** stays: a chip id that briefly leaves the live set keeps its rank instead of being dropped-and-reappended.
- **Known step-1 edges (acceptable / future):** two genuinely separate windows at a pixel-identical frame won't be disambiguated by frame alone (rare); closing the active tab relies on a takeover tab appearing promptly. `Docs` not yet written; this section is the live reference.

### Strip Drag-Reorder Mechanism — self-drawn in-app drag (路线 A, 残影根治)

> 2026-06-20. The live-zone chip drag carries a **self-rendered floating copy** (`DockStripView.floatingDragCopy`), driven by an in-app `DragGesture(coordinateSpace: .named("strip"))` — **not** SwiftUI system drag. The reorder logic underneath (`StripOrdering` / `StripOrderStore`, seat-lifecycle ranks) is unchanged; only the *carried image* changed. Full rationale + reversal log: Obsidian `03 设计决策`「拖动载体改自绘（松手残影根治）」.

- **Do not reintroduce SwiftUI `.onDrag` / `NSItemProvider` for the strip.** The system snapshots the chip and fades that image **in place on release** — an un-suppressible "release ghost". That ghost is exactly the bug this mechanism replaced; the API gives no handle to stop the fade.
- **Do not switch to AppKit `beginDraggingSession` (路线 B) to gain cross-panel drag-into-drawer.** The cross-panel convenience and the ghost are the *same coin*: a system-owned drag image floats above all panels AND can't be suppressed. Route B keeps that image, so it can't guarantee a ghost-free release — it's the one path that would be wasted work.
- **Cross-panel endgame (C) = extend the self-drawn copy, not the system session.** Drag-into-drawer should grow the floating copy into a screen-spanning carrier (global mouse monitor + drop-into-drawer hit-test), keeping full ownership of the image. 路线 A is deliberately step 1 of this. **C now shipped (2026-06-20) — see Cross-Panel Drag-into-Drawer below.** The carried image + mouse-up fallback (old in-panel `floatingDragCopy` / `watchDragEnd`) moved into `DragController`; `DockStripView` keeps only the `"strip"`-space reorder + `grabOffset` (guardrails 1–2 below still hold).
- **Implementation guardrails that must hold:** (1) one `"strip"` coordinate space shared by chip frames (`ChipFramePreferenceKey`, read via `.background` GeometryReader — never `.overlay`, which steals clicks), the finger location, and the floating copy — else horizontal scroll skews finger↔copy↔target. (2) `grabOffset` (chip center − press point) so an edge-grab doesn't snap the copy's center to the cursor. (3) a slim `watchDragEnd` mouse-up fallback (a `DragGesture` can cancel without `.onEnded`) plus a `liveOrderIDs` onChange that clears a stale drag if the dragged window vanishes mid-drag — together they stop a hidden chip's slot from sticking as a gap. (4) the floating copy forces the hovered visual (`ChipView.forceHover`, since it's `allowsHitTesting(false)`) so it doesn't pop size on grab.

### Cross-Panel Drag-into-Drawer — screen-spanning self-drawn carrier (路线 C 第一步)

> 2026-06-20. Drag a live-zone chip onto the capsule (drawer button) to stash it (= 收进抽屉, previously context-menu only). This is step C of the strip-drag endgame: the self-drawn floating copy grew from an in-strip overlay into a screen-spanning carrier. Everything cross-panel lives in `DragController`. Full rationale + reversal log: Obsidian `03 设计决策`「拖卡进抽屉（跨面板自绘载体）」.

- **`DragController` is the single authority** for the local+global mouse monitors, the carrier `NSPanel`, the drop decision, and the idempotent teardown. `DockStripView` only: starts the drag (`beginDrag`), reads `draggingItem` to hide the in-place chip, reads `isOverDropZone` to suppress reorder. Do not split monitor/panel lifecycle back across views — a SwiftUI view rebuild would strand a monitor or lose drag state.
- **The carrier is a screen-spanning, transparent, click-through panel** (`level .popUpMenu`, `ignoresMouseEvents = true`, covers `screen.frame`). Required because the in-strip floating copy is clipped by the 92pt dock panel and cannot escape it. Created on `beginDrag`, `orderOut` on every teardown path (no ghost panel).
- **Probe-verified mouse mechanism (2026-06-20):** a mouse-down drag from our nonactivating panel holds an implicit grab → events stay with our app → the **LOCAL** monitor catches the whole drag incl. `leftMouseUp`, even over the drawer / other windows. The GLOBAL monitor fires 0× (kept only as a cheap backstop). Use `NSEvent.mouseLocation` (screen coords) for the carrier position + drop hit-test — never strip-internal coords (the gesture's `value.location` + chip frames live in the `"strip"` space, a different system).
- **The SwiftUI `DragGesture` does NOT stop when the finger leaves the panel** (keeps firing `onChanged` far outside). So reorder must be **explicitly** gated: skip `reorderTarget` while `isOverDropZone`, and hit-test the dragged-over chip with its **full frame** (x+y), not x-only — else lifting toward the capsule still reorders the strip.
- **Drop zone = capsule content area + small tolerance:** `capsulePanel.frame.insetBy(shadowPadding − 8)` (the visible 52×52 capsule + 8pt), plus the drawer's `insetBy(shadowPadding)` frame only while the drawer is open. Do NOT use the full panel frame (it includes the 20pt transparent shadow margin) and do NOT widen the tolerance much — the capsule abuts the strip, too wide stashes on a near-miss.
- **`canStash` rejects only: missing bundleID, and `com.apple.finder`** (Finder keeps its strip slot — see Finder rules). Do **not** reject `isAppLevelFallback`: the drawer running zone renders app-level icons fine, and a background app whose windows aren't currently sampled shows as an app-level chip; rejecting it caused "Safari/Dia can't be dragged in until activated" (2026-06-20 reversal).
- **Teardown is idempotent + clear-before-commit:** monitor mouseUp, gesture `onEnded`, and the `pressedMouseButtons == 0` poll may all fire; `endDrag` guards on `draggingItem`, clears state first, then commits the stash. The `liveOrderIDs` onChange is only the mid-drag window-vanish safety net (`cancelDrag`), not the normal-release path.
- **Same no-system-drag guardrail as the strip:** do not reintroduce SwiftUI `.onDrag` / AppKit `beginDraggingSession` — the release ghost. The screen-spanning carrier is the deliberate alternative.

### Strip action target — route to `actionWindowID`, never the chip id token

- A **strip** chip's `StripItem.id` is its **stable identity token** (`tabgrp-…`), not a window id; the action target is `item.actionWindowID` (the representative window). All strip show/hide/minimize/toggle calls must pass `actionWindowID`. (The **drawer** no longer does window-level actions at all — it's app-centric, see below; so the old drawer-tap-uses-`item.id` bug is gone with that path.)

### Drawer = app-centric, one-icon-per-app, ordered by `DrawerOrderStore` (2026-06-21)

> The drawer is the deliberate **app-view** island (原则 2). Drawer-internal drag-reorder + drag-back-to-strip ship as the symmetric mate of 拖卡进抽屉. Full rationale: Obsidian `03 设计决策`「抽屉内拖动排序 + 拖回任务条」.

- **One bundleID = one icon.** The drawer renders every member as an app-level `LauncherChip` (not per-window `ChipView`). A multi-window stashed app shows one icon. Click = **app-level** (`LauncherChip.handleTap`: frontmost→hide, else unhide+open; not-running→launch) — **never** window-level toggle. Do not reintroduce per-window drawer chips or a window-id tap target.
- **Launch-zone chips pass `isRunning: false` (zone-based, not the live value).** A launching app's process appears before its window; passing the live `isRunning` flips it true mid-launch → `LauncherChip.onChange(of:isRunning)` calls `stopBounce` early → the launch bounce dies before the window shows. Running zone → `running: true`, launch zone → `running: false`.
- **`DrawerOrderStore` = single display-order layer, keyed by bundleID, persisted permanently** (bundleID is reuse-stable across reboots → no boot-time guard, unlike `StripOrderStore`). **Order is kept over the MEMBER SET (`drawerStore ∪ launchFavoriteStore`), not the currently-visible icons** — a pure favorite leaves the drawer while running and returns on quit; syncing only on visible ids would drop then re-append it (lost order). `PanelCoordinator.syncDrawerOrder()` runs on either store's change, even with the drawer closed. Membership (stashed vs pinned) still lives in the two original stores; only *order* is unified here.
- **Same-zone reorder only.** Running-zone icons reorder relative to running-zone icons, launch-zone likewise (`reorderTarget` filters candidates to the dragged item's zone). Cross-divider drops are meaningless (zone = running-state, not order) and would surface invisibly later.
- **Generalized `DragPayload`** (`source + id + bundleID + item: StripItem? + visualKind + canExternalDrop`) replaces the StripItem-only drag — drawer icons have no `StripItem`, so `bundleID` is the key. `id` is the source-region reorder key (strip = `item.id` token, drawer = bundleID).
- **Symmetric cross-panel drag via the same `DragController` carrier.** Drop zones by source: `.strip`→capsule (stash, `drawerStore.add`); `.drawer`→dock strip panel (unstash, `drawerStore.remove`). `isOverStashZone`/`isOverUnstashZone` drive the capsule vs strip highlight. `canExternalDrop`: strip = `canStash`; drawer = `drawerStore.contains(bid)` — **pure favorites are reorder-only** (no external drop, no highlight; dragging one to the strip is a no-op snap-back, matching their no-`移回` menu).
- **Drag-out = `drawerStore.remove` only (= 右键「移回任务栏」 semantics).** A coexisting favorite pin survives, so a stashed+favorited closed app stays in the drawer launch zone after drag-out — **not a bug**.
- **Carrier renders by `visualKind`:** drawer drags use the lightweight `DrawerDragIconView` (icon only — no `LauncherChip` menu/bounce/tap in the carrier).
- **Reorder (drawer-internal AND strip-into-drawer) is driven by `dragController.globalLocation`, NOT a per-chip `DragGesture.onChanged` (2026-06-22, hard guardrail).** The per-chip `DragGesture` on a drawer chip is kept **only to start the drag** (`beginDrag` once); the moment the first reorder moves the dragged chip in the `LazyVGrid`, SwiftUI **cancels that gesture** → `onChanged` stops → "挤一下就卡住" (carrier still follows via the monitor, so it *looks* alive). So `DrawerView.updateDrawerReorder()` (and the strip→drawer enter/revert) run off the `globalLocation` `onChange`, mapping screen→`"drawer"` space via the live `drawerRootScreenRect`. Do **not** move reorder back into the chip gesture.
- **Strip-into-open-drawer = convert-on-enter, reversible (2026-06-22, supersedes the 2026-06-21 placeholder/precise-insertion mechanism — do not revisit that).** When a strip chip enters the open drawer body, `DragController.convertStripToDrawer()` **adds it to `drawerStore` and flips the payload to `.drawer`**; from then it's an ordinary drawer member reordered by the same global-mouse path (one grow when added, no per-hover panel resize → none of the old placeholder/`dropPreview`/panel-resize-feedback flicker). **Reversible:** dragging back out of the body calls `revertStripFromDrawer()` (remove + restore the `.strip` payload) so a re-opened drawer shows its **original** layout, not the jostled one; only release **inside** the drawer commits. Enter/exit use **hysteresis** (enter tol 28pt, exit must clear 48pt) to stop boundary flap (add/remove churn = grow/shrink flicker). The deleted machinery: `dropPreview`/`setDropPreview`/`stashAtCommit`/`DrawerOrderStore.insert`/`baseRunningFrames`/placeholder cells/`subscribeDropPreviewRelayout`.
- **Spring-load keyed on `dragOriginatedFromStrip`, not live `source` (2026-06-22).** A strip-origin drag earns spring even after it converts to `.drawer`. Hover capsule → open after ~0.4s; leave drawer+capsule → close after a **~0.35s delay** (not immediate — a brief excursion over the strip must not close it; the old immediate `inDock`→close was the "drawer randomly closes mid-drag" bug); re-hover capsule → reopen, repeatable. `springOpenDrawer` re-tests **capsule hit** (not `isOverDropZone`, which after convert means the dock strip and is false over the capsule → would block reopen). Both timers **must** use `RunLoop.main.add(_, forMode: .common)` (a `scheduledTimer` never fires during drag event-tracking). After opening call `dragController.bringCarrierToFront()`.
- **Known accepted (blocked item):** a small residual top-edge flicker can still occur when a strip chip hovers right at the drawer's bottom boundary (gate re-eval). Deferred — see Obsidian Backlog. The egregious downward-overlap dip is fixed (see Panel relayout NSHostingView rule).

### Drawer-back-to-strip = precise landing, running apps only, app→N-chip block (2026-06-22)

> The symmetric mate of 拖卡进抽屉: dragging a drawer icon back onto the strip lands its window chip(s) **where you release**, others slide aside live (convert-on-enter, reversible). Scope deliberately narrow. Full rationale: Obsidian `03 设计决策`.

- **Scope = running app with ≥1 real live window only.** Gate via `DockStripView.canConvertToStrip` reading **snapshot** (`StripItem.items(from:snapshot)` has a non-`isAppLevelFallback` window), **not** the live zone — pre-convert the app is still a `drawerStore` member and filtered out of `liveNatural`, so a live-zone check would read empty and mis-judge "not running". **Reject** Finder, messaging apps (their chips go to the pinned zone / pop-out handling is special), app-level-fallback-only stashes, and not-running stashes — all **fall back to the old `drawerStore.remove`-on-release** (no precise position).
- **One drawer icon = the app's whole window-chip block.** Multi-window apps land all chips contiguous, internal order = current display order (`appLiveChipIDs` reads `stripEntries`). New primitive `StripOrdering.movingBlock(order, move: ids, relativeTo: target?, after:)` (target `nil` = append; only moves ids already in `order`).
- **Landing goes through staged placement consumed inside `sync` — never write `liveOrder` outside `sync` (hard guardrail).** At convert the chips aren't in the live zone yet (`drawerStore.remove` materializes them next render), so you can't know their ids. `StripOrderStore.stageExternalBlock(bundleID, relativeTo, after)` records the **bundleID + target**; the next `sync(current:appKeyOf:)` resolves `blockIDs = next.filter{ appKeyOf==bid && !app-* }`, applies `movingBlock`, records `boundIDs`. Writing `liveOrder` directly outside `sync` gets clobbered by the very `sync` that `drawerStore.remove` triggers (reconcile re-appends new ids next-to-sibling/tail). Continuous reorder after materialization uses `reorderBlock(ids:…)` direct (ids now remembered → reconcile keeps them).
- **Convert/revert/commit responsibilities are split and single-owner.** `DragController.convertDrawerToStrip()` = `drawerStore.remove` + record `convertedDrawerBundleID` (does **not** flip `source`, so `.drawer` keeps `isOverUnstashZone` + the `endDrag` `.drawer` branch valid). **Realtime leave** (DockStripView clearlyOut) → `stripOrderStore.cancelExternalBlock()` **then** `revertDrawerToStrip()` (order matters — cancel must clear `liveOrder` + `absentSince` before `drawerStore.add` re-triggers `sync`, else the 5s rank-retention grace revives a ghost rank). **Normal mouseUp** is only ever seen by `endDrag` → if converted it fires `onDrawerToStripCommitted` (PanelCoordinator → `commitExternalBlock`) and does **not** touch membership again; do not infer commit from `draggingPayload → nil` in the view.
- **`DrawerView`'s `allMembers` onChange `cancelDrag` must exempt `isConvertedToStrip`** — convert intentionally removes the dragged bundleID from the drawer; without the exemption that safety net cancels the whole drag the instant it converts.
- **Reuses the same `DragController` carrier + `ScreenRectReader` (now module-internal, shared with DrawerView) + global-mouse-driven reorder + hysteresis** as 拖卡进抽屉. Same no-system-drag guardrail.
- **Strip width is frozen during any cross-panel converted drag; it changes only on release — both directions (owner 2026-06-22).** Convert (either way) would resize the centered panel mid-drag (drag-back materializes chips → wider; drag-out removes a chip → narrower). Owner wants the length change to happen **after** the item lands. Mechanism = a single clamp in `PanelCoordinator.relayout`: while converted it lays out the dock at `frozenDockContentWidth` (captured = the pre-drag width) instead of the measured `fittingSize`, so chips just **overflow** (drag-back: the normal too-many-chips scroll/edge-fade) or leave **trailing space** (drag-out) — the panel width never moves; live slide-aside is fully kept. `subscribeConvertRelease` watches `Publishers.CombineLatest($convertedDrawerBundleID, $isConvertedFromStrip)`: on the false→true edge it captures `frozenDockContentWidth = lastDesiredWidth` (the convert flags are set **before** the `drawerStore` mutation so this captures the pre-drag width); on true→false (commit **or** revert) it clears the clamp and fires one `relayout` — that's when the taskbar animates to final length. Do **not** go back to gating individual relayout subscriptions per-direction (misses spring-open's own relayout); the single clamp in `relayout` is the chokepoint. `isConvertedFromStrip` is now a stored `@Published` (was computed) so the strip→drawer side can drive this too.
- **Carrier visual is aligned to in-strip drag (owner feedback): once converted, the carrier morphs from the small drawer icon into the full `ChipView`, the representative chip is hidden in place (gap), and the carrier stops shrinking (no 0.82 over-drop-zone scale).** Single source of truth `DragController.convertedRepresentative: StripItem?` (@Published, set by `DockStripView.syncConvertedCarrier` to the display-order-first **materialized** live chip) drives **both** the carrier render and the `draggingID` gap — they must use the **same** id or you get "carry A, gap opens at B". `convertedDrawerBundleID` is `@Published` too (carrier must re-render on convert). Pre-materialization the representative is nil → carrier stays the drawer icon (never a chip without a gap). For multi-window you carry the representative chip + one gap; siblings ride along as the contiguous block.

### Optimistic Action State — interruptible interaction (去转圈 + 可打断)

> 2026-06-13. Deliberately relaxes the older "lock the chip while an action is in flight" rule — that rule is **superseded, do not reinstate**.

- Clicking a chip writes an **optimistic state** (predicted status + frontmost) immediately; UI render and toggle-planning read it first, cleared when the real snapshot confirms or after a ~4s timeout (silent rollback, no shake/red). This *is* the feedback — **no spinner**.
- **Scope = show/hide only** (toggle / activate / minimize / hide). **close / quit stay locked until confirmed** — making a chip vanish optimistically then bounce back on failure is worse than a brief wait. Re-entrancy guard lives in `AppRuntime.trigger`, not UI graying.
- Grounding diagnostic: a spinner (`pending`) ≠ "action running" — execution is a one-shot AX call, pending is just awaiting the snapshot. The real bug was `toggle` re-reading a not-yet-flipped snapshot → repeating one action instead of alternating; the optimistic state fixes both that and the interruptibility.
- Known accepted: `hideApp` only optimistically covers the clicked chip; other windows of the same app wait for the snapshot.

### Panel Layout — shadowPadding coordinate rule

> SwiftUI `.shadow()` draws the panel shadow, so each panel window reserves `shadowPadding = 20pt` of transparent margin on all sides (AppKit `NSWindow` shadow is off; `clipShape` does the rounding).

- **Any coordinate math on `dockFrame` / `capsuleFrame` must subtract `shadowPadding` first** to reach the visual content edge — forgetting this offsets placement (4 such bugs fixed 2026-06-19, `c44d17e`).
- **Reading `fittingSize.width` must subtract `2 × shadowPadding`**, else the panel sizes ~80pt too wide.

### Panel relayout = target-frame-driven + animated transitions (2026-06-21)

> The strip is centered, so any width change re-centers it and the capsule (anchored to its right edge) + drawer (anchored to the capsule) follow — the whole cluster shifts. Owner chose to **animate** that shift (smooth slide) rather than leave it an instant jump. Full rationale: Obsidian `03 设计决策`「面板平滑过渡 + 目标 frame 驱动」.

- **Never chain-read a panel's live `.frame` to position the next panel during an animated relayout.** `animator().setFrame` only *starts* the animation; reading `.frame` right after returns the **old** frame, so the capsule lands relative to the pre-animation strip and the drawer relative to the pre-animation capsule → misalignment / drawer-overlaps-strip (the 2026-06-21 bug). Instead compute all targets with **pure functions** (`dockTargetFrame`/`capsuleTargetFrame(forDock:)`/`drawerTargetFrame(forCapsule:size:)`) fed each other's *target*, via the single entry `layoutPanels(contentWidth:on:animated:)` → `relayout(animated:)`.
- **All panels animate in one `NSAnimationContext` group** (`setFrames`, 0.22s easeInEaseOut) so they share one timeline. Content changes (snapshot / stash / drawer resize) → `animated: true`; **open / `screenParametersChanged` / hover-switch / first layout → `animated: false`** (those shifts are expected, animating them is wrong). `didInitialLayout` forces the first layout instant.
- **Drop zones + drawer-open read the stored target frames** (`lastDockTargetFrame`/`lastCapsuleTargetFrame`/`lastDrawerTargetFrame`, live-frame fallback when `.zero`), not live `.frame` — mid-animation live frames disagree with the visual/landing position.
- **The drawer's `contentView` is a plain `NSView` container with the `NSHostingView` pinned inside via `autoresizingMask` — the `NSHostingView` is NOT the window's `contentView` directly (2026-06-22, hard guardrail).** When an `NSHostingView` *is* the contentView, AppKit resizes the window to the SwiftUI content size **top-anchored** the instant content grows — so a row-add dropped the drawer's bottom edge DOWN (`y 68→24`, top pinned at 218) a frame before our bottom-anchored `setFrame` pulled it back up = the "抽屉先向下扩展再上移" dip (logs: `cur(y=24 h=194)` under `anim=false`). The plain-container interposition stops the window from sizing to content; height is driven only by `layoutPanels`/`setFrames`. We still read the hosting view's `fittingSize` for layout via the stored `drawerContentHost`. (`sizingOptions = []` was tried first and broke content fill — detached drawer; do not use it.)

### Minimum deployment target = macOS 12 (Monterey) — gate newer APIs

> 2026-06-22. Lowered from 14.0 to 12.0 so older Macs can install (a Monterey user hit "can't be used with this version of macOS"). `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` = 12.0 in all configs; `LSMinimumSystemVersion` = 12.0.

- **Do not use macOS 13+/14+ APIs unguarded** — it silently re-raises the minimum OS and re-breaks old Macs (the build only *warns* via deprecation, it doesn't stop you; the gate failure shows up only at install time on the old OS). Wrap any newer API in `if #available(macOS X, *)` with a ≤12 fallback.
- Already converted for 12.0: `defaultScrollAnchor` → `compatLeadingScrollAnchor()` (availability-gated helper in `DockStripView`); the two-parameter `onChange(of:_:)` / `onChange(of:initial:)` → the old single-value `onChange(of:perform:)` (the `initial: true` seed is replicated with `.onAppear` calling the same `reconcileLiveOrder()`); `Task.sleep(for: .seconds(_))` (macOS 13+) → `Task.sleep(nanoseconds:)`.
- The deprecation warnings from the old single-value `onChange` are expected back-deployment noise, not bugs.
- Compile-verify by building at target 12 (`MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=12.0`) — a clean build proves no >12 API slipped in. Note: CI/dev machines run newer macOS, so runtime behavior on 12/13 still needs a real old-OS check.

## Collaboration Rule

The project owner directs the product but does not read code, and does not read English comfortably — reply in Chinese.

- Write every status update, plan, and result so it's fully understandable with no engineering background: lead with what changed, what it means for how the app behaves, and what's next, in everyday language.
- Technical detail (file names, APIs, mechanisms) is a supplement that comes after the plain explanation, never the only way to follow the message. Don't make the owner decode jargon to understand what you did or why.
- When a choice needs the owner's input, frame it as product behavior and trade-offs they can weigh, not as implementation details.
