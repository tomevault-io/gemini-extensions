## Project

PeakNav ([peaknav.com](https://peaknav.com)) renders world mountains in 3D, with
paths, ways, and nearby peak names projected onto the terrain. It is a
[libGDX](https://libgdx.com/) cross-platform app built with Gradle, shipping on
Desktop, Android and iOS (the HTML target exists but is incomplete).

Terrain and OpenStreetMap data come from two HuggingFace datasets, retiled to the
[slippy map](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Slippy_map_tilenames) convention
(see `README.md`).

## Module layout

Gradle modules (`settings.gradle`): `core`, `desktop`, `android`, `ios`, `html`,
`headless`.

- **`core`** — all shared, platform-independent logic. Package root
  `com.peaknav`. Almost every change belongs here. Sub-packages of note:
  - `viewer/` — the libGDX app (`MapApp`), screens, camera, rendering, tiles.
  - `viewer/controller/` — `MapController` (the app-wide context, reached via
    `PeakNavUtils.getC()`), `CurrentLocation` (`getC().L`).
  - `compatibility/` — abstractions each platform implements (`NativeScreenCaller`,
    `LoadFactory`, etc.).
  - `elevation/`, `pbf/`, `database/`, `network/`, `satellite/`, `utils/`.
  - `geo/` — the map's own geometry: `Tile`, `LatLong`, `BoundingBox` and
    `MercatorProjection` (the web Mercator tile grid). Written for PeakNav, with no
    mapsforge left anywhere; `TestGeo` pins the behaviour the rest relies on - tile edges,
    clamping at the map's edge, neighbours wrapping round, and tile equality including the
    tile size (caches key tiles of size 1 and of `MapTile.TILE_SIZE` apart). `pbf/` reads
    the downloaded `.osm.pbf` tiles into its own `Way`, `PointOfInterest` and `Tag`.
  - `skyline/` — matching a photograph's skyline to the terrain: `TerrainHorizon`
    (the horizon all around a point, from an `ElevationSampler`), `SkylineExtractor`
    (the sky/ground line in a picture: `SkyFeatures` + `SkyClassifier`, a
    gradient-boosted forest read from the resource `sky_model.bin` next to it, give
    every pixel a sky probability; `BoundaryFeatures` + `boundary_model.bin` score
    every position as "the skyline passes here"; a minimum-cost path traces the
    boundary; both forests are trained by `tools/skyline_train.py`) and
    `SkylineMatcher` (bearing, pitch and field of view by optimisation, with a
    calibrated "confident" verdict). Pure Java, no libGDX; `viewer/PhotoSkylineAligner`
    is the app-side glue that runs it when a geotagged photo is loaded and offers
    to point the camera, or on demand from the photo bar's match button; debug
    builds (`LoadFactory.isDebugBuild()`) get a third button that saves the photo,
    pose and overlay as a dataset sample under `LoadFactory.getDebugSamplesDir()`.
    `gesture/PhotoPin` is the pinned-point state the input controller rotates and
    zooms around while a photo is shown. Its accuracy is measured, not assumed: see the
    `skylineBenchmark` tool below, and keep the thresholds in `SkylineMatcher`
    tied to what the benchmark reports.
  - `pistes/` — the ski slopes viewer, drawn from its own data layer `PBF_PISTES` (OpenSnowMap's
    extract, zoom-10 tiles in zoom-8 archives on the HuggingFace dataset beside the highways,
    queued with every download and served after the highways, before AREAS). `PisteRasterizer`
    writes each nearby tile's `SKI_SLOPES` texture - flow phase down the nearest downhill run as
    sine and cosine (oriented by the loaded terrain's heights at its ends, else by the way's
    direction), blue/red/black difficulty, coverage - in `TileRendererRunnerPistes`, on the
    roads' executor; the ski slopes block of `assets/fragment_shader.glsl` paints fat runs with a
    band flowing downhill on `u_time`, and piste areas as a translucent fill. `LiftRasterizer`
    writes the `SKI_LIFTS` texture from the same ways - travel phase uphill, the kind of lift, a
    distance field across the line - and the lifts block draws each kind its own way: red cabins
    for cable cars, orange for gondolas, white chairs, yellow handles on a dashed line for drag
    lifts, blue stripes for magic carpets. Runs and lifts are labelled through `RoadLabelPlanner.
    planPistes`/`planLifts` and `RoadNameRenderer`. Switched in the Roads "..." submenu: "Ski
    pistes" (`P.isSkiSlopesVisible()`), and in its "..." piste names, lifts and lift names; independent of
    `PISTES_IN_MAP_DATA`, which still gates the pistes the road textures would carry.
  - `roads/` — roads, tracks, trails and pistes, drawn by the GPU on every platform.
    `RoadClassifier` sorts the OSM ways of `PBF_HIGHWAYS` into classes (road rank, SAC trail
    difficulty, piste difficulty; tunnels, pavements and plazas dropped; relation tags from
    `PbfTileBinaryParser` read in groups so only hiking routes lend a trail their number).
    `RoadTileRasterizer` writes each tile's two **distance** textures - per class, how far every
    texel is from the nearest line, plus a dash phase and the difficulties - and
    `assets/fragment_shader.glsl` turns them into lines of any width, colour, outline and
    animated dash. The look is `RoadStyle` (colours, dash length and speed; the options
    pane's Roads "..." submenu), read every frame, so a style change redraws no tile. Keep the
    shader's `ROAD_BAND`/`ROAD_BIAS`/`DASH_BASE_METERS` equal to the rasterizer's, and every
    line at least `MIN_HALF_TEXELS` wide: a distance field cannot hold anything thinner than
    half a texel, and a line below it breaks into blobs. `RoadLabelPlanner` +
    `RoadLabelGeometry` choose where names go (spots every 150 m on trails and 600 m on roads,
    numbered from each way's middle; the menu's label frequency keeps every 1st/2nd/4th/8th,
    decided at draw time by `RoadLabelCandidate.label(stride)`, with a trail's number-and-name
    alternating with its number alone); `viewer/renderer_gdx/RoadNameRenderer` draws them
    tilted along their ways, trail and track labels on a translucent plate of the trail's own
    colour with dark or white text to suit it (street names on a fainter plate of the road
    colour, halo kept; river names halo only), falling back to the number alone where the full
    label is too long for the trail in view. Labels reach 10 km (trails; roads 9, tracks 7) and
    shrink past 1.5 km (`RoadLabelGeometry.distanceScale`, to 62% at the least), both going by
    apparent distance - distance over `RoadLabelGeometry.zoom` (tan of half the 30° base field of
    view over tan of half the current one), so zooming in on a far valley labels it, as far as
    `ROAD_CUTOFF_DEGREES`; candidates off
    the camera's bearing are dropped before their terrain lookup, tiles are visited nearest
    first, and within a rank nearer labels win. `lastDecisionStats()` says why candidates in range
    were not shown (off screen, end-on, hidden, crowded out, ...) - ask it before tuning. The extracts carry almost no waterways and only the pistes
    that are also highways, so rivers are labelled but not drawn, and pistes are switched off
    altogether - not drawn, not labelled, no menu switch - by `PreferencesManager.PISTES_IN_MAP_DATA`
    until the extraction also keeps `piste:type` ways.
- **`desktop`** — LWJGL3 launcher (`DesktopLauncher`), Swing-based native screens.
- **`android`** — Android launcher/activity, fragments, native screens.
- **`ios`** — RoboVM launcher plus a real `IOSLoadFactory`: logging, caches, file
  writing, crash reports, a `libsqlite3` binding for the tile catalogue, and the
  `NativeScreenCallerIOS` surface. Shipping: on the App Store since 1.2.0 as
  `com.peaknav.viewer`, iOS 12 and later. It is the youngest target, though, and
  a few things the other platforms have are still absent from it — see "iOS"
  under Build & run.
- **`html`** — GWT target.
- **`headless`** — drives the real renderer off-screen (`PeakNavRenderer`,
  `RenderCli`; driven by `snapshots/generate_snapshots.py`): programmatic camera, label/sky toggles, waits
  built on `PeakNavAppState` signals, snapshot capture. See `headless/README.md`;
  its test suite (`:headless:test`) boots the actual app.

## Cross-platform architecture

Shared code in `core` never talks to a platform API directly. Instead it goes
through interfaces/abstract classes in `com.peaknav.compatibility`, each with a
concrete per-platform implementation wired up at startup:

- **`NativeScreenCaller`** — native UI: file/gallery pickers, dialogs, toasts,
  sharing, permissions. Implemented by `NativeScreenCallerDesktop` (Swing /
  `JOptionPane`), `NativeScreenCallerAndroid` (`AlertDialog`, fragments) and
  `NativeScreenCallerIOS` (`UIAlertController` presented on the key window).
  Reached from shared code via `PeakNavUtils.getNativeScreenCaller()` — it can
  still be `null` before a platform has wired one in, so null-check before use.
- **`LoadFactory`** — provides platform services (SQLite, downloaders, graphics
  factory, logger, caches). Set into `MapApp` by each launcher.

**When you add a native capability**, add an `abstract` method to
`NativeScreenCaller` and implement it in *all three* of
`NativeScreenCallerDesktop`, `NativeScreenCallerAndroid` and
`NativeScreenCallerIOS`. iOS does subclass it now, so leaving it out breaks
`:ios:compileJava` — and only on a Mac, where that module tends to get built.

Common patterns from shared code:
- Navigate the camera to coordinates: `getC().L.setCurrentTargetCoords(lat, lon)`
  (also triggers a "download missing map data" prompt when needed).
- Show localized text: `PeakNavUtils.s("Some_Key")` (see i18n below).

## Build & run

Use the **wrapper** (`./gradlew`, Gradle 9.3.0), not a system `gradle` — a system
8.x will not build this project. The build needs JDK 17; pass it explicitly if your
default JDK is something else. The daemon is disabled by config, so builds are
one-shot and each command cold-starts.

```bash
J=-Dorg.gradle.java.home=/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk-amd64
./gradlew :core:compileJava $J        # compile shared code (fast sanity check)
./gradlew :desktop:compileJava $J     # compile desktop
./gradlew :desktop:run $J             # run the desktop app (mainClass DesktopLauncher)
./gradlew :core:test $J               # JUnit 5 tests (core/src/test/java)
./gradlew :headless:test $J           # boots the real app off-screen; needs DISPLAY
```

- **Android** requires the SDK: set `ANDROID_HOME` or add `sdk.dir` to
  `local.properties`. Without it `:android:*` tasks fail (that is an environment
  issue, not a code error). Compile with
  `gradle :android:compileDebugJavaWithJavac`.
- **iOS** builds only on a Mac, and needs **full Xcode** — the Command Line Tools
  alone are not enough. RoboVM shells out to `xcrun`/`simctl` and rejects a
  developer directory that is not an Xcode bundle
  ("`/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools` does not appear to be a valid Xcode
  path"). Install Xcode, then `sudo xcode-select -switch /Applications/Xcode.app`.

  ```bash
  ./gradlew :ios:build                  # Java only — works on any OS, no Xcode needed
  ./gradlew :ios:launchIPhoneSimulator  # AOT-compile, link and run in the simulator
  ./gradlew :ios:createIPA              # device build; needs a signing identity
  ```

  `:ios:build` compiles the module's Java against `core` and is the check worth
  running from Linux or Windows — it catches the usual breakage (a new abstract
  method on `NativeScreenCaller`) without any Apple tooling. The native link is
  where the rest shows up: it needs the `natives-ios` jars for every gdx extension
  `core` uses (`gdx-platform`, `gdx-freetype-platform`, `gdx-box2d-platform` — see
  `ios/build.gradle`), since a Java-only compile passes happily without them.

  Before the first build, generate the app icons with `ios/build_icons.sh` (needs
  `brew install librsvg`). The asset catalogue names 18 PNGs that `.gitignore`
  excludes, so a fresh clone has none of them and `actool` produces an icon-less
  bundle.

  A matching **iOS platform** must be installed too, not just Xcode — `ibtool`
  compiles `LaunchScreen.storyboard` and fails with `iOS <version> Platform Not
  Installed` without it, *after* the AOT compile and link have both succeeded.
  Install it with `xcodebuild -downloadPlatform iOS` (a ~10 GB download; no sudo
  needed).

  The GUI Simulator is not required: `xcrun simctl` can boot, install, launch and
  screenshot headlessly, which is useful because Xcode's Simulator.app is fussy
  about matching the host macOS — an Xcode whose Simulator predates the host will
  die at launch with a missing-symbol dyld error while `simctl` carries on fine.

  ```bash
  xcrun simctl install booted ios/build/robovm.tmp/IOSLauncher.app
  xcrun simctl launch booted com.peaknav.viewer      # add --console-pty for logs
  xcrun simctl io booted screenshot shot.png
  ```

  Downloading data and search *are* built. The download methods are deliberately
  thin — the work is all `core`'s, exactly as on the desktop, and what a platform
  has to get right is running it off the render thread and clearing
  `setMapDataDownloadStarted` in a `finally` (left set, the missing-data prompt
  never fires again for the whole session). Search is a `UIAlertController` asking
  for text and a second one offering the results, not the scrolling screen the
  other platforms build; typing `lat, lon` navigates straight there.

  Two traps worth keeping in mind if you touch that flow:
  - The download consent (`P.setCollectDownloadInfo`) must be set **in the same
    task** as the download it enables. `PeakNavDownloadManager` skips every request
    without it, so a download that starts first shows progress and fetches nothing.
  - `OnlineSearch.failed()` never calls its listener, so anything waiting on a
    Nominatim response needs its own timeout or it waits forever.

  What is still missing — shipped gaps, not release blockers, and each surfaces at
  runtime rather than at compile time:
  search finds only online results until `assets/geonames_index.362` is built.
  (Roads and trails used to be missing as well, because mapsforge drew them onto
  a canvas each platform had to supply; they are rasterized in plain Java by
  `core`'s `roads` package now and styled by the terrain shader, so iOS draws them
  like everything else; no platform has a mapsforge graphics backend any more.)
  Everything else the shared UI reaches is implemented: GPS and the
  gyroscope camera via CoreLocation and CoreMotion (`LocationControllerIOS`,
  `OrientationPointerControllerIOS` — the latter a port of Android's
  `OrientationPointerController` with CoreMotion's reference frame
  (X = magnetic north, Y = west) swapped into the app's east-north-up world);
  the gallery/camera pickers through `UIImagePickerController` (geotags come
  from the `PHAsset`, since iOS strips GPS EXIF from picked files); the tutorial
  and app-info pages in a `WKWebView` over the bundled HTML; and GPX both from
  the in-app document picker and handed over by other apps (Info.plist document
  type + `IOSLauncher.openURL`).

### Points vs pixels

`IOSLauncher` sets `config.hdpiMode = HdpiMode.Pixels`. **Do not remove it.** The
backend's default is `Logical`, where `Gdx.graphics.getWidth()` returns points —
375 on a 2× phone with a 750-wide framebuffer. Shared code hands that value
straight to `Gdx.gl.glViewport` (`AbstractScreen`, `IntroScreen`,
`MapViewerScreen`), so the whole app renders into the bottom-left quarter of the
screen; and `DefaultIOSInput` scales touches by `pixelsPerPoint` whatever the mode
is, so input and rendering end up one display-scale apart and nothing is tappable.

Neither symptom can appear on the other targets — Android reports pixels, and a
non-retina desktop display has logical == pixels — so this is iOS-only by nature
and easy to reintroduce.

### What RoboVM's runtime does *not* have

This is the single biggest source of iOS-only breakage, and none of it fails at
compile time — `core` is compiled against a JDK, and only the AOT link and the
device runtime see the difference. RoboVM's class library is derived from
Android's libcore and predates Java 8:

- **No `java.util.function`, no `java.util.stream`, no `java.nio.file`, no
  `java.time`, no `Optional`.** The AOT compiler reports these as
  `phantom class` warnings and carries on; you find out at runtime.
- **No Java 8 statics**: `Integer.max`, `Float.min`, `Double.max`, `String.join`
  and friends. Use `Math.max`/`Math.min` and build strings by hand — they behave
  identically everywhere, so this costs the other platforms nothing.
- **No Java 8 default methods on collections**: `List.sort`, `Map.putIfAbsent`,
  `Map.getOrDefault`, `Map.computeIfAbsent`, `Collection.removeIf`,
  `Iterable.forEach`. Use `Collections.sort(list, cmp)`; for `putIfAbsent`,
  declare the reference as `ConcurrentMap` (a Java 5 interface RoboVM does have)
  rather than `Map`. A single `List.sort` in the label renderer threw
  `NoSuchMethodError` mid-frame once terrain existed, which aborted every frame
  before `stage.draw()` — the symptom was "all buttons and labels invisible but
  still clickable", three layers from the cause.
- **No Java 8 constants** like `Float.BYTES` (javac inlines them, so these are
  compile-audit noise rather than runtime crashes — but keep them out anyway).
- **No `Locale.getScript()`**, a Java 7 method Android added late.
- **No `java.io.File.toPath()`** either, so code cannot even reach `java.nio.file`.
  To rename a finished file into place, use
  `PeakNavUtils.getLoadFactory().getFileMover()` — a `com.peaknav.utils.FileMover`
  supplied per platform, `NioFileMover` (nio, atomic-and-replacing stated in the
  type system) on desktop/Android/headless and `RenameFileMover` (POSIX
  `rename(2)`, the same guarantee) on iOS. The downloader's direct
  `Files.move(REPLACE_EXISTING, ATOMIC_MOVE)` calls used to fail here, which meant
  every tile downloaded in full and then died on the last step.

Two consequences worth knowing before adding a dependency to `core`: Guava cannot
be used at all (its `Equivalence` implements `BiPredicate`, so building any cache
throws `NoClassDefFoundError` on launch — `com.peaknav.utils.LruCache` replaced
it), and ICU4J is pinned to 59.1 on iOS because 63+ call `Locale.getScript()`
directly. **A new dependency in `core` needs checking against this list**, since
`:ios:compileJava` will pass regardless.

The whole class of bug can be caught at a desk instead of on a device: compile
`core` (and `ios/src`) with the RoboVM runtime as the bootclasspath and javac
flags every missing API at once —

```sh
javac -nowarn -source 8 -target 8 \
  -bootclasspath ~/.gradle/caches/**/robovm-rt-2.3.25.jar \
  -cp "<runtimeClasspath>" -d /tmp/out $(find core/src/main/java -name '*.java')
```

The only expected errors are `NioFileMover`'s `java.nio.file` references: that
class is the desktop/Android implementation of `FileMover`, constructed only by
those platforms' `LoadFactory`s and never reachable from the iOS entry point
(and `ios/robovm.xml` force-links no `com.peaknav` classes, so RoboVM never
tries to compile it). Run this after touching `core` in any nontrivial way; it
is minutes cheaper than an AOT build and catches what the normal compile cannot.

Two more RoboVM-side traps, both handled in `ios/build.gradle`:

- **Pre-Java-6 `jsr`/`ret` bytecode** is rejected outright
  (`Unrecognized bytecode instruction: 168`). Lucene 3.6.2 is full of it, so the
  three Lucene jars are rewritten through ASM's `JSRInlinerAdapter` by the
  `inlineLuceneJsr` task. Other platforms use the untouched jars.
- **Soot, RoboVM's bytecode frontend, cannot read some modern bytecode**:
  "Exception reference used other than as the first statement of an exception
  handler". commons-compress hit this (and two runtime failures besides), which
  is why the project no longer uses it at all — downloads are unpacked with
  `java.util.zip.GZIPInputStream` + `com.peaknav.utils.TarReader` instead.
- Full asset/data setup (fonts, icons, Lucene geonames index) is described in
  `README.md`; a plain `:core`/`:desktop` compile does **not** need it.
- **Build-time data tools** live in their own source set, `core/src/tools/java`
  (package `com.peaknav.tools`), so nothing they pull in ships in the app. Each is
  exposed as a Gradle task in the `peaknav` group — currently
  `./gradlew :core:buildGeonamesIndex --args="cities500.txt alternateNamesV2.txt out_dir"`,
  which rebuilds the place-search index, and
  `./gradlew :core:skylineBenchmark --args="path/to/manifest.json"`, which runs the
  photo skyline matcher over a dataset of geotagged photos with a known camera
  heading and reports accuracy and the precision of its confident matches. The
  datasets are built by `tools/skyline_dataset.py` (GeoPose3K, or Wikimedia Commons
  photos carrying a `heading:`); `TestSkylineDataset` runs the same benchmark when one
  is installed under `~/.peaknav/skyline_dataset/` or `$PEAKNAV_SKYLINE_DATASET`, and
  skips otherwise. `skylineTrainingDump` writes the two forests' training rows (from
  a truth-ridge file made once from posed photos, or from pictures with a sky mask)
  with the app's own feature code, `tools/skyline_train.py` fits and exports a
  forest, and `skylineMaskEval` scores the extractor alone against hand-traced
  skylines (CH1 and the web set, never used for training). Changing `SkyFeatures` or
  `BoundaryFeatures` means retraining both: a model file records its feature count
  and the loader ignores a mismatch. Measure any change to the extractor on both the
  bearing benchmark and the mask score before keeping it; the numbers that matter are
  gross misses, not pixels. The "?" tutorial (`assets/info/app_tutorial.html`) is
  screenshots of the app with a ring on the widget each slide is about: after a UI
  change, rebuild the jar and run `tools/tutorial_screenshots.py`, which takes the
  pictures over the REST API (`/frame?ui=true`, `/widgets`) and rewrites the slide
  data between the page's SLIDES markers; the captions live in that script, and the
  screenshot file names in the three platforms' tutorial code. The captions are keys, not
  words: they live in `assets/i18n/strings_*.properties` as `<key>` and `<key>_detail`,
  the key list is `TutorialStrings.KEYS`, and each platform injects the translations for
  the device's language through the page's `OVERLOAD::get_string` marker, exactly as it
  injects the screenshots. Adding a slide means adding its key to all seven files. Put new data-prep tools here rather than in
  a test: an index builder hidden in `TestLuceneGeonames` meant a half-built index
  directory from an earlier run could fail the whole suite.

### Desktop installers

```bash
./gradlew :desktop:installers       # Windows .exe, macOS .dmg (x2), Linux .deb + .AppImage
```

Built with construo (application image + bundled JRE 17) wrapped by NSIS,
genisoimage, dpkg-deb and mksquashfs — all of which cross-compile, so every artefact
is produced from one machine whichever OS it runs. `jpackage` deliberately is not
used: it only emits an installer for the OS it runs on. Needs `nsis`,
`genisoimage` and `squashfs-tools` installed. See `desktop/packaging/README.md`,
especially the signing section — nothing is code-signed for Windows or macOS, and
that is not something the build can fix.

## Conventions

- **Java 8** source/target across non-Android modules. No records, `var`, switch
  expressions, or other 9+ syntax in `core`. Android may use newer APIs guarded by
  its min SDK.
- 4-space indentation; match the surrounding file's style, naming, and comment
  density.
- Keep new dependencies out of `core` unless clearly justified — the module
  intentionally stays lean and must run on Android's constraints
  (e.g. Lucene is pinned to **3.6.2**, the last Android-compatible release — do
  not bump it).
- Prefer writing shared, testable logic in `core` over duplicating it per platform.
- **Option menus: Back is the last button of every submenu, and in a two-column layout it
  sits in the left column** - where the main menu has it. `OptionPane.addButtonsToTable`
  handles this: filling left to right would put Back on the right whenever the button count
  is even, so it swaps the last two buttons then. A layout built by hand with `addPair` must
  pass Back as the *left* argument (the Roads and paths submenu once put it on the right).

## Internationalization

User-facing strings live in `assets/i18n/strings_<lang>.properties` for
**en, it, fr, de, es, pt, no**. There is no base `strings.properties`, and missing
keys render as `???key???` — so **add every new key to all 7 files**. Look strings
up with `PeakNavUtils.s("Key")`.

## Gotchas

- `getNativeScreenCaller()` may be `null` — guard it.
- The Gradle wrapper JAR is **not** in git (`.gitignore` ignores `/gradle/`), so
  `./gradlew` fails with "Unable to access jarfile" on a fresh clone. Regenerate it
  with a system Gradle 9.3.0: `gradle wrapper --gradle-version 9.3.0`.
- The Gradle daemon is off; expect each command to cold-start.
- Don't rely on the Android module compiling in a headless/SDK-less environment;
  verify Android changes against existing patterns in the `android` module.
