# AGENTS

## Project Overview

`llvm-autoreduce` is an automated LLVM bug reproducer reduction tool. It focuses on reducing crash and miscompilation reproducers in LLVM's middle-end and back-end. See `README.md` for the user-facing overview.

## Development Environment

- **Python dependency management** — use `uv` (see `uv.lock`). Run `uv sync` to install all dependencies (including dev). Run `uv pip install -e .` to install the package itself in editable mode. The virtualenv lives at `.venv/`.
- **Testing** — `uv run pytest tests/` or `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/`. Test config is in `pyproject.toml` under `[tool.pytest.ini_options]`.
- **Linting** — `uv run ruff check .`
- **Toolchain build** — The LLVM, Alive2, and LLUBI toolchains are built by `scripts/update-tools.sh` (invoked automatically by the daemon on each round). Requires an LLVM installation with development headers on the host for bootstrapping.

## Repository Language Rules

- Write all repository content in English and reply to the user in the user's language.

## User Interaction Rules

- If requirements or plans are ambiguous, eliminate disagreement instead of guessing: first explore the codebase when that can answer the question, otherwise ask clarifying questions aggressively, preferably one at a time.
- Clarifying questions must drive toward shared understanding by walking the design tree and resolving decision dependencies; each question must cover purpose, constraints, success criteria, or scope boundaries as appropriate, include all viable options, avoid requiring free-form input, and state the recommended answer.
- After the user approves execution, keep going until the full planned task is complete. Do not stop for intermediate progress reports, return control while the approved goal is only partially implemented, or ask whether to continue with obvious next steps, natural follow-ups, or clear previews, summaries, or refinements unless a genuine blocker, real ambiguity, or material risk requires user input.
- If something should obviously be done now, do it instead of deferring it to "later", "next", or a "follow-up". When reviewing or refining in-progress work, immediately implement any concrete fix you understand and that is not blocked.
- Resolve encountered difficulties autonomously whenever possible.
- When handing control back to the user after task completion, end the response with `Done.`

## Design and Planning Rules

- Before proposing a design or implementation, inspect the current project context, including relevant files, documentation, and recent changes.
- State assumptions explicitly. If materially different interpretations remain after exploration, surface and resolve them instead of silently choosing one.
- For feature work, behavior changes, and other creative or architectural tasks, complete a design step before implementation. If the request is too broad for one coherent spec or plan, decompose it into smaller subprojects and handle them one at a time.
- After gathering enough context, present 2-3 viable approaches with trade-offs and a recommended option, size the design sections to the topic, and validate the design with the user before implementation.
- Before substantial implementation, define concrete success criteria and explicit checks that prove completion; prefer tests, builds, or other verifiable validation over vague goals.
- Unless the user explicitly asks for a temporary workaround, limited experiment, reduced-scope language design, or backwards compatibility, design and implement the final intended product: complete behavior, durable interfaces, maintainable structure, the full language design rather than a staged or minimal subset, and clean breaking changes instead of compatibility shims during rapid iteration.
- If a requested feature depends on a lower-level prerequisite, implement that prerequisite as part of the work instead of lowering the acceptance bar, trimming scope, or presenting a partial workaround as complete.
- Do not limit the solution to the smallest easy increment or patch size when the correct solution requires broader structural changes. Make decisive, coherent refactors, including renaming APIs, reshaping module boundaries, or replacing flawed internal structures when needed.
- Design systems as small, well-bounded units with clear responsibilities, explicit interfaces, and dependencies that are easy to understand and test independently.
- In existing codebases, follow established patterns unless changing them is necessary to support the current goal.
- Apply YAGNI strictly. Make focused changes, avoid unrelated reformatting or cleanup, and remove only unrequested features, speculative abstractions, unnecessary complexity, or artifacts made unused by your own change unless broader cleanup was requested.

## Git Commit Rules

- Preserve a linear history. Do not force push except when rebasing a PR branch onto the latest `origin/main` and force-pushing that same PR branch update.
- Do not amend commits that have already been pushed, and do not rewrite, replace, or reorder existing commits unless the user explicitly requests it.
- Before starting work, ensure the worktree is clean; if prior changes are present, review them and commit the relevant ones before beginning new task work.
- Commit changes automatically after each completed milestone without waiting for the user to ask. After finishing a logical unit of work that passes tests and pre-commit checks, immediately stage and commit with a proper Conventional Commit message, then ensure the worktree is clean.
- Never commit temporary files, scratch artifacts, ad hoc notes, or other non-durable byproducts.
- Use specific Conventional Commits for every commit. When a commit is non-trivial, include a body describing what changed, why it changed, and what validation was performed; make the subject identify the precise logical unit and the body record the concrete scope of the change.
- Split commits by logical unit so they stay focused and reviewable.
- Ensure relevant tests pass before creating a commit, assume pre-commit hooks will run, and do not bypass them with `--no-verify`.
- **CRITICAL — ACCEPTED RISK:** When auditing code or reporting findings, you MUST NOT report issues that are already explicitly annotated with `ACCEPTED RISK` in source code comments. These are known, deliberate trade-offs. Re-reporting them is noise and wastes review time. Before including any finding in an audit, verify it is NOT tagged `ACCEPTED RISK` in the relevant source file.
- **AUDIT SCOPE — TOOLCHAIN STATE:** Do not audit for crash-consistency of toolchain state files (e.g., `.known-good`), partial-build recovery, or atomicity of multi-component state updates in `scripts/update-tools.sh`. The build script handles rollbacks and the daemon's health check detects unusable toolchains.
- **AUDIT SCOPE — CONTAINER CONFIG:** Do not audit container/deployment configuration files (`Dockerfile`, `devcontainer.json`, `.devcontainer/`) for security. These are deployment artifacts managed separately from the application logic.
- **AUDIT SCOPE — FILESYSTEM INFRASTRUCTURE:** Do not audit for filesystem-level failures (stale NFS mounts, kernel hangs during `shutil.rmtree`, disk-full race conditions during writes). These are operating environment concerns, not application logic defects.
- **AUDIT SCOPE — HOST CRASH / UNCLEAN SHUTDOWN:** Do not audit for data loss or duplicate processing caused by host machine crash, SIGKILL, kernel panic, power loss, or any other form of unclean shutdown. The daemon's durability guarantees assume a clean shutdown path. Audit findings about missing `fsync`, write-ahead logging, or crash-consistency of non-build state files (e.g. `processed.txt`) are excluded — these are operating environment concerns, not application logic defects.
- **AUDIT SCOPE — EXTERNAL PROCESSED.TXT MODIFICATION:** The daemon loads `processed.txt` into an in-memory cache once at startup and only appends to it via `mark_processed()`. External modification of `processed.txt` (e.g. manually removing an entry to force re-processing) has no effect on a running daemon — the in-memory cache is never invalidated or reloaded. The only supported way to re-process an issue is to restart the daemon after editing the file. Do not audit for stale-cache-after-external-edit scenarios.
- **AUDIT SCOPE — TEST COVERAGE:** Do not treat missing test coverage for functions that require substantial mocking (subprocess invocation, external HTTP APIs, LLVM toolchain binaries) as audit findings. Integration/e2e tests for the full pipeline are valued but not mandatory — the daemon's verification step and ACCEPTED RISK annotations cover the critical failure modes. Unit-testable pure logic (validation, extraction, workdir) should remain tested.
- Do not consider multi-daemon scenarios, race conditions, or parallel execution in design or audit work. The daemon is designed to run as a single instance. Do not raise findings that only apply to concurrent or multi-threaded execution — the daemon processes issues sequentially in a single thread.
- **AUDIT SCOPE — AGENT OUTPUT TRUST:** Do not audit for missing defensive validation of AI agent output fields (size checks, format sanitization, content bounds). The daemon trusts agent-produced JSON as authoritative — the prompts and agent configs are the contract. Adding code-level guards against malformed-but-valid agent output is unnecessary defense-in-depth and falls outside the threat model.
- **AUDIT SCOPE — TRANSIENT PER-ISSUE FAILURES:** Do not audit for transient exceptions that affect a single issue. The per-issue exception handler logs and continues; the issue may be retried in a future round. Only raise findings for bugs that crash the entire daemon process or cause systemic failure (e.g., every issue or round fails deterministically).
- **AUDIT SCOPE — PER-ISSUE mark_processed PATTERN:** `reprocess_issue` marks issues permanently processed (`mark_processed()`) on every internal failure path by design — every pipeline stage (agent timeout, JSON parse, verify mismatch, report generation, submission) calls `mark_processed()` to permanently skip the issue. The outer per-issue exception handler also calls `mark_processed()`. This is the FINAL design decision — do NOT re-audit this pattern. The daemon treats every failure as a terminal outcome for that issue. Transient infrastructure outages that affect all issues in a round naturally sort out on the next poll cycle with fresh issues.
- **AUDIT SCOPE — TRIVIAL / FALSE-POSITIVE FINDINGS:** Do not report findings that are cosmetic, stylistic, or semantically equivalent to existing behavior. Do not report issues that are already handled by test coverage, existing ACCEPTED RISK annotations, or any other AUDIT SCOPE exclusion above. Before reporting any finding, exhaustively verify it is NOT covered by any exclusion and NOT a trivial/negligible concern. If a finding can be described as "this is technically X but doesn't actually cause problems," do NOT report it.
- **AUDIT SCOPE — HTTP RETRY GRANULARITY:** Do not audit `_request()` for retrying specific 5xx status codes that are permanent errors (501, 505). GitHub's API does not return these in practice; the current blind-retry-on-all-5xx behavior is accepted. The retry delays total ~14 seconds across 3 attempts, which is negligible in a 30-minute poll cycle.
- **AUDIT SCOPE — NON-DETERMINISTIC GODBOLT LINK SELECTION:** Do not audit the non-deterministic ordering of Godbolt links when >3 are present (`set(list(links)[:3])` in `_fetch_godbolt`). Most issues contain ≤2 Godbolt links, and an issue is processed exactly once, so link-ordering variation across runs has zero practical impact.
- **AUDIT SCOPE — AGENT OUTPUT FIELD BOUNDS:** Do not audit for missing upper bounds on agent-produced fields (e.g., `llubi_args`, `alive2_args`, `lli_args`, `args`). The daemon trusts agent output as authoritative. Subprocess execution uses 8 GB RLIMIT_AS and per-call timeouts (`VERIFY_TIMEOUT`, `REDUCE_TIMEOUT`) which bound resource consumption regardless of argument values. Extreme values may cause systemic per-round false negatives if every issue triggers a timeout, but the agent is trusted to produce reasonable values and such behavior would be observable via daemon logs. Adding programmatic bounds on individual fields is unnecessary defense-in-depth.
- **AUDIT SCOPE — AGENT FORMAT ERRORS:** Do not audit for agent-produced format errors in `_generate_report` (e.g., backtick characters in `pipeline` / `crash_pattern` breaking markdown code spans, triple-backtick sequences in reduced IR breaking the code fence). The report is submitted as a GitHub issue body for human consumption — malformed markdown is a cosmetic issue, not a security or correctness concern. Natural Python exceptions (e.g., `KeyError` from direct dict access on missing keys) are acceptable because `_validate_meta` / `_validate_result` already enforce schema conformance upstream and failures are logged via `log.exception`. No additional defensive formatting or schema re-validation is needed in the report generation path.

## Design Philosophy

### Agent as Oracle (首要原则)

**All agents are trusted LLVM domain experts.** They possess deep knowledge of LLVM IR, passes, toolchain binaries, oracle semantics, and common bug patterns. Prompts give broad strategic direction — they never spell out step-by-step procedures that the agent already understands. Do not write prompts that treat the agent as a novice; trust its expertise to fill in implementation details.

Every field produced by an agent (`args`, `pipeline`, `crash_pattern`, `alive2_args`, `llubi_args`, `lli_args`, `pass_name`, `oracle`, `reference_file`, `ir_file`) is accepted verbatim. The daemon never second-guesses or overrides agent decisions — the agent's `result.json` is the single source of truth. The daemon's `verify()` step confirms that the bug still reproduces with the reported tool and arguments but does NOT re-derive the pass, oracle, or pipeline.

**Single exception — mandatory pass options:** Both `_validate_meta` (extract.json) and `_validate_result` (result.json) enforce that `instcombine` in `args` MUST be written `instcombine<no-verify-fixpoint>`. The daemon never reports a reproducer whose pipeline contains a bare instcombine pass. This is a structural requirement (a standalone instcombine pass must disable the fixpoint verification loop), not a semantic second-guessing of the agent's pass choice. It applies only when instcombine is already present in the args — it is NOT a requirement to include instcombine. The extractor/reducer prompts and skills document this rule.

### Prompt Design Rules

When writing agent definitions, prompts, and skill files, follow these rules:

1. **Security reviewer — broad patterns, not exhaustive lists.** The agent knows what malicious code looks like. Describe the categories of concern (process execution, file tampering, network operations, obfuscation) and use "including but not limited to" language. The agent understands both C source patterns and LLVM IR patterns (`declare`/`call` to external functions). Do not enumerate every function name — trust the agent's security knowledge.

2. **Extractor — reproduce first, never trust issue text alone.** The extractor MUST run the toolchain to reproduce the bug before extracting metadata. Stack traces and crash output in the issue body are reference hints only — the crash_pattern field MUST come from actual toolchain output reproduced in the workdir. This validates the reproducer is functional before the reducer spends time on it.

3. **Skills — timeouts on every toolchain command.** Every direct invocation of `opt`, `llc`, `llubi`, `alive-tv`, `lli`, or `clang` outside of `interestingness.sh` MUST include a `timeout` wrapper. Default `--max-steps 1000000` is sufficient for llubi — report timeouts as potential infinite loops. `interestingness.sh` commands already carry timeouts but standalone reproduction/bisect commands must also be protected.

4. **Pass name conversion — agent domain knowledge.** Agents know that `opt-bisect-limit` outputs pass names in CamelCase (e.g. `InstCombine`) and that `-passes=` accepts kebab-case (e.g. `instcombine`). Do not explain this conversion — provide at most a single example as hint. The agent understands LLVM's pass naming conventions.

5. **lli crash = miscompilation.** The daemon's `_validate_result` rejects `tool: "lli"` for crash type. The extractor handles this: when an issue reports an lli crash, the extractor first tries `llc` on the same IR. If `llc` also crashes → classify as `crash` (llc). If `llc` does NOT crash → classify as `miscompilation` (the lli crash is backend miscompilation, not a crash bug). The reducer never sees an lli crash classification.

6. **Always provide full JSON schema in prompts.** Every prompt that asks an agent to produce JSON MUST include the complete schema with all required fields for every supported bug type. Agents are experts at content but need the exact field names and structure the daemon expects.

### llubi / lli Equivalence

`llubi` (reference interpreter) and `lli` (JIT backend) produce identical stdout for correct IR when the backend has no bug. However, if the IR's `main()` function uses `argc`/`argv`, the two tools may produce different output even on correct backends because `llubi` passes its own command-line arguments to `main()` (argv[0] = the input file name) and fills non-standard main signatures with null values. Before using the `lli` oracle, the reducer agent MUST preprocess the IR to remove `main()` argument dependencies — either by stripping `argc`/`argv` usage from the IR or by confirming the IR does not use command-line arguments.

**Unrecognized main signatures:** For a `main()` that does not match `int main(int, char**)` (e.g. `main(ptr)`), upstream llubi prints `warning: The signature of function 'main' does not match 'int main(int, char**)', passing null values for all arguments.` on stderr and CONTINUES with null argument values — it does not reject the IR (unlike the removed `llubi_legacy`, which exited with "Unsupported main function signature"). The warning is benign: both the reference and transformed runs in `verify_llubi` see the same signature, so it can never cause a false nonzero_exit confirmation. The danger is only a false NEGATIVE: a program that dereferences the null-filled arguments makes llubi exit non-zero with `Immediate UB detected: Invalid memory access via a pointer with nullary provenance.`, failing the reference run. In that case the agent must preprocess the IR first (strip main() parameters, replace uses with constants) — mirroring the lli-oracle preprocessing.

**Runnable, self-contained llubi reproducers:** Every llubi reproducer — at BOTH the extract stage (the extract.json `reproducer_file`) and the reduce stage (the result.json `ir_file`) — MUST define an `i32 @main(` entry point (parameters allowed) and MUST NOT contain `external global`. `verify_llubi` enforces both requirements statically in Python (`_check_main_i32`, `_check_no_external_global`); the llubi interestingness templates mirror them with grep guards (`grep -q "i32 @main("` / `grep -q "external global"`). Rationale: llvm-reduce would otherwise delete or retype the entry function (nothing runnable for llubi to execute) or strip global initializers into `external global` references — external symbols cannot be resolved by llubi/lli, and the reproducer must stay self-contained so daemon verification and upstream reproduction behave identically. Parameterized `i32 @main(i32 %argc, ptr %argv)` remains valid: the reference and transformed llubi runs see the same signature.

### llubi Unsupported Instructions / Intrinsics

`llubi` does not implement every instruction and intrinsic. Any instruction it cannot interpret causes it to exit non-zero with `Unrecognized instruction` on stderr (all such paths funnel through `onUnrecognizedInstruction` + `setFailed()` in `llvm/tools/llubi`). Such failures are a tool limitation, NOT a miscompilation — reporting them as `nonzero_exit` miscompilations is a false positive. The extractor, reducer, and daemon MUST therefore:
- treat any llubi run whose stderr contains `Unrecognized instruction` as "llubi cannot handle this IR", never as a bug (extractor: classify `unrelated` unless the unsupported construct can be removed while preserving the bug);
- exclude such failures from the daemon's `verify_llubi` `nonzero_exit` confirmation (`_llubi_failed_unsupported` → reject);
- keep the `grep -q 'Unrecognized instruction' _err.txt && exit 1` guard in the nonzero_exit interestingness template so llvm-reduce never reduces toward an unsupported-instruction failure.

### Always Generate IR First

Reduction operates exclusively on LLVM IR. Never use `clang` to compile C/C++ reproducers to native binaries for verification — the oracle tools (llubi, alive-tv, lli) work directly on IR. If a reproducer is C/C++ source, the extractor agent compiles it to `.ll` once; all subsequent pipeline stages work with the `.ll` file.

### Bisect to Single Pass Before Reduce

Both crash and miscompilation pipelines MUST first bisect the full pipeline to identify the single pass that triggers the bug, then run `llvm-reduce` with only that single pass. This produces the smallest possible `args` field (e.g. `-passes=licm` instead of `-passes='default<O2>'`).

### Bug Type Classification

The daemon supports four bug categories across two stages (extract → reduce):

| Bug type | Extract stage | Reduce stage |
|----------|--------------|-------------|
| Mid-end crash | oracle=`opt`, trigger crash with `opt <args> reproducer.ll`, extract literal substring from stderr as `crash_pattern` | tool=`opt`, bisect + llvm-reduce, verify crash pattern reproduces with `opt <args> reduced.ll` |
| Backend crash | oracle=`llc`, trigger crash with `llc <args> reproducer.ll`, extract literal substring from stderr as `crash_pattern` | tool=`llc`, llvm-reduce directly (no bisect), verify crash pattern reproduces with `llc <args> reduced.ll` |
| Mid-end miscompilation | oracle=`opt`, `llubi reproducer.ll` as reference (must exit 0), `opt <args> reproducer.ll \| llubi` as transformed — stdout differs **or transformed rc≠0/crash** confirms | 1. `alive2` — preferred, requires function pass + no TBAA/unsupported metadata<br>2. `llubi` — fallback, bisect to single pass → llvm-reduce → verify reference rc=0, transformed diff or rc≠0/crash |
| Backend miscompilation | oracle=`llc`, `llubi reproducer.ll` as reference (must exit 0), `lli reproducer.ll` as JIT output — stdout differs **or lli rc≠0/crash** confirms | oracle=`lli`, bisect to single pass → llvm-reduce → verify reference rc=0, lli diff or rc≠0/crash |

### Interestingness Script Timeouts

Every subprocess inside `interestingness.sh` (opt, llubi, alive-tv, lli, llc) MUST include a timeout via the `timeout` command to prevent a single hanging candidate from consuming the entire reduction time budget.
