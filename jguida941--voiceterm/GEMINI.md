# Agents

This file is the canonical SDLC, release, and AI execution policy for this repo.
If any process docs conflict, follow `AGENTS.md` first.

## Purpose

VoiceTerm is a polished, voice-first overlay for AI CLIs.
Primary support: **Codex** and **Claude Code**.
Gemini CLI remains experimental.

Goal of this file: give agents one repeatable process so every task follows the
same execution path with minimal ambiguity.

## Instruction scope and precedence

When multiple instruction sources exist, apply this precedence:

1. Session-level system/developer/user instructions.
2. The nearest `AGENTS.md` to the files being edited.
3. Ancestor `AGENTS.md` files (including repo root).
4. Linked owner docs from the source-of-truth map.

If subtrees require different workflows, add nested `AGENTS.md` files and keep
them scoped to that subtree.

## Autonomous execution route (required)

Use this route to run end-to-end without ambiguity:

1. Load `dev/active/INDEX.md`, then `dev/active/MASTER_PLAN.md`.
2. Use `INDEX.md` role/authority fields to decide which active docs are required:
   - `tracker` is execution authority.
   - `spec` is read when matching MP scope is in play.
   - `runbook` is read for active multi-agent cycles.
   - `reference` is context-only; do not treat as execution state.
3. Select task class in the router table and run the matching command bundle.
4. Apply risk-matrix add-ons for touched runtime risk classes.
5. Run docs-governance/self-review/end-of-session checklist before handoff.

## Mandatory 12-step SOP (always)

Run this sequence for every task. Do not skip steps.

1. Run session bootstrap checks and load `dev/active/INDEX.md` (`bundle.bootstrap`).
2. Decide scope (`develop` work or `master` release work).
3. Classify task using the task router table.
4. Load only the required context pack listed for your task class.
5. Link or confirm MP scope in `dev/active/MASTER_PLAN.md` before edits.
6. Implement changes and tests.
7. Run the bundle required by your task class.
8. Run matrix tests required by touched risk classes.
9. Update docs/screenshots/ADRs required by governance.
10. Self-review security, memory, errors, concurrency, performance, and style.
11. Push through branch policy and run post-push audit (`bundle.post-push`).
12. Capture handoff summary using `dev/guides/DEVELOPMENT.md` template.

## Execution-plan traceability (required)

For non-trivial work (runtime/tooling/process/CI/release), execution must be
anchored in an active tracked plan doc under `dev/active/`.

1. Create or update the relevant execution-plan doc before implementation
   (for example `dev/active/autonomous_control_plane.md`).
2. Execution-plan docs must include the marker line:
   `Execution plan contract: required`.
3. Execution-plan docs must include these sections:
   - `## Scope`
   - `## Execution Checklist`
   - `## Progress Log`
   - `## Audit Evidence`
4. The associated MP scope must be present in both `dev/active/INDEX.md` and
   `dev/active/MASTER_PLAN.md`.
4.1 In multi-agent runs, progress/decisions must be written into the active
    plan markdown and/or `MASTER_PLAN` updates; hidden memory-only coordination
    is not acceptable execution state.
5. `python3 dev/scripts/checks/check_active_plan_sync.py` is the enforcement
   gate and must pass before merge.

## Continuous improvement loop (required)

Use a repeat-to-automate loop so the toolchain gets stronger after every run.

1. Record friction points in the active-plan progress log and/or handoff notes
   for every non-trivial execution session.
2. If the same workaround/manual step repeats 2+ times in the same MP scope,
   resolve it before closure by:
   - automating it as a guarded `devctl` command/workflow/check with tests, or
   - logging it as explicit debt in `dev/audits/AUTOMATION_DEBT_REGISTER.md`
     with owner, risk, and exit criteria.
3. "Cannot automate yet" is acceptable only with a documented reason and a
   guard path (checklist/runbook entry that prevents unsafe execution).
4. When automation lands, update command/docs surfaces in the same change
   (`AGENTS.md`, `dev/scripts/README.md`, `dev/guides/DEVCTL_AUTOGUIDE.md` as needed).
5. Baseline full-surface audit execution starts from
   `dev/audits/2026-02-24-autonomy-baseline-audit.md` and should be copied
   forward for each new audit cycle.
6. Audit cycles should emit quantitative metrics from event logs
   (`automation_coverage_pct`, `script_only_pct`, `ai_assisted_pct`,
   `human_manual_pct`, `success_rate_pct`) and chart outputs via
   `python3 dev/scripts/audits/audit_metrics.py`.

## AI operating contract (required)

1. Be autonomous by default: implement, test, docs, and validation end-to-end.
2. Ask only when required: ambiguous UX/product intent, destructive actions,
   credentials/publishing/tagging, or conflicting policy signals.
3. Stay guarded: do not invent behavior, do not skip required checks.
4. Keep changes scoped: ignore unrelated diffs unless user asks.

## Prerequisites

Required tools (install before running any bundle):

- **Rust toolchain**: `rustup` with `1.88.0+` (`rustup update stable`)
- **Python**: `3.11+` (`python3 --version`)
- **cargo-deny**: `cargo install cargo-deny --locked`
- **markdownlint-cli**: `npm install -g markdownlint-cli@0.45.0`
- **GitHub CLI**: `gh auth status -h github.com`
- **jscpd** (optional, duplication audits): `npm install -g jscpd`

Verify with: `python3 dev/scripts/devctl.py list` (exits non-zero if critical
tools are missing).

## Error recovery protocol

When a bundle command fails mid-run:

1. **Read the failure output** — identify which check failed and why.
2. **Fix the root cause** — do not skip or retry blindly.
3. **Re-run only the failed command** to confirm the fix, then re-run the full
   bundle from the start to catch cascading issues.
4. **If the fix is non-trivial**, create an MP item and document the failure in
   the active plan's progress log before continuing.
5. **Never use `--no-verify`, `set +e`, or manual workarounds** to bypass a
   failing gate without an explicit waiver recorded in the checkpoint log.
6. **After any direct/raw `cargo test` or manual test-binary run**, execute:
   `python3 dev/scripts/devctl.py check --profile quick --skip-fmt --skip-clippy --no-parallel`
   and confirm the `process-sweep-pre/process-sweep-post` steps report no orphaned/stale VoiceTerm test processes.

## Engineering quality contract (required)

For non-trivial Rust runtime/tooling changes, contributors must:

1. Validate design/implementation against official references before coding:
   - Rust Book: `https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/`
   - Rust Reference: `https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/`
   - Rust API Guidelines: `https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/`
   - Rustonomicon (unsafe/FFI): `https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/`
   - Standard library docs: `https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/`
   - Clippy lint index: `https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/`
2. Keep naming and ownership explicit: names should describe behavior, modules
   should keep one responsibility, and public APIs should expose stable
   intent-based contracts.
3. Treat technical debt as explicit debt: `#[allow(...)]`, non-test
   `unwrap/expect`, and oversized files/functions require documented rationale
   and a follow-up MP item when not resolved immediately.
4. Prefer consolidation over duplication: extract shared helpers instead of
   repeating logic across overlays/themes/settings/status surfaces.
5. Record references consulted in handoff for non-trivial Rust changes.

## Branch policy (required)

- `develop`: integration branch for normal feature/fix/docs work.
- `master`: release/tag branch and rare hotfix branch.

Non-release work flow:

1. `git fetch origin`
2. `git checkout develop`
3. `git pull --ff-only origin develop`
4. `git checkout -b feature/<topic>` or `git checkout -b fix/<topic>`
5. Implement and run required checks.
6. Require user local validation before push:
   - Ask the user to test locally and confirm go-ahead before any non-release
     `git push`.
   - If the user asks to test before commit, keep changes uncommitted until
     that local validation completes.
7. Commit and push short-lived branch only after explicit user approval.
8. Merge short-lived branch into `develop` only after required checks pass.

Routine helper:

- `python3 dev/scripts/devctl.py sync --push` can audit/sync `develop` +
  `master` + current branch with clean-tree and fast-forward guards.

Release promotion flow:

1. Ensure `develop` checks are green.
2. Merge `develop` into `master`.
3. Tag from `master`.

If a hotfix lands on `master`, back-merge `master` to `develop` promptly.

## Dirty-tree protocol (required)

When `git status --short` is not clean:

1. Do not discard unrelated edits.
2. Edit only files needed for the current task.
3. Use commit-range checks carefully (`--since-ref`) only when the range is
   valid for current branch/repo state.
4. Note unrelated pre-existing changes in handoff when they affect confidence.

## Active-plan onboarding (adding files under `dev/active/`)

When adding any new markdown file under `dev/active/`, this sequence is required:

1. Add an entry in `dev/active/INDEX.md` with:
   - path
   - role (`tracker` | `spec` | `runbook` | `reference`)
   - execution authority
   - MP scope
   - when agents should read it
2. If the file carries execution state, reflect that scope in
   `dev/active/MASTER_PLAN.md` (the only tracker authority).
2.1 If the file is an execution plan, include marker
    `Execution plan contract: required` and sections `Scope`,
    `Execution Checklist`, `Progress Log`, and `Audit Evidence`.
3. Update discovery links in `AGENTS.md`, `DEV_INDEX.md`, and `dev/README.md`
   if navigation/ownership changed.
4. Run `python3 dev/scripts/checks/check_active_plan_sync.py`.
5. Run `python3 dev/scripts/checks/check_multi_agent_sync.py`.
6. Run `python3 dev/scripts/devctl.py docs-check --strict-tooling`.
7. Run `python3 dev/scripts/devctl.py hygiene`.
8. Commit file + index + governance docs in one change.

  - `./scripts/macros.sh list`
  - `./scripts/macros.sh install --pack safe-core --project-dir . --overwrite`
  - `./scripts/macros.sh validate --output ./.voiceterm/macros.yaml --project-dir .`
  - Validate `gh auth status -h github.com` behavior when GH macros are included
- Dependency/security-hardening changes:
  - `python3 dev/scripts/devctl.py security`
  - optional strict workflow scan: `python3 dev/scripts/devctl.py security --with-zizmor --require-optional-tools`
  - fallback manual path:
    `cargo install cargo-audit --locked`,
    `cd rust && (cargo audit --json > ../rustsec-audit.json || true)`,
    `python3 dev/scripts/checks/check_rustsec_policy.py --input rustsec-audit.json --min-cvss 7.0 --fail-on-kind yanked --fail-on-kind unsound --allowlist-file dev/security/rustsec_allowlist.md`

## Release SOP (master only)

Use this exact sequence:

1. Confirm `git checkout master` and clean working tree.
2. Verify version parity:
   - `python3 dev/scripts/checks/check_release_version_parity.py`
   - `rust/Cargo.toml` has `version = X.Y.Z`
   - `pypi/pyproject.toml` has `[project].version = X.Y.Z`
   - `app/macos/VoiceTerm.app/Contents/Info.plist` has
     `CFBundleShortVersionString = X.Y.Z` and `CFBundleVersion = X.Y.Z`
   - `dev/CHANGELOG.md` has release heading for `X.Y.Z`
   - `dev/active/MASTER_PLAN.md` Status Snapshot has
     `Last tagged release: vX.Y.Z` and `Current release target: post-vX.Y.Z planning`
3. Verify release prerequisites:
   - `gh auth status -h github.com`
   - `CI=1 python3 dev/scripts/devctl.py release-gates --branch master --sha "$(git rev-parse HEAD)" --skip-preflight --wait-seconds 1800 --poll-seconds 20 --format md`
   - GitHub Actions secret `PYPI_API_TOKEN` exists for `.github/workflows/publish_pypi.yml`
   - GitHub Actions secret `HOMEBREW_TAP_TOKEN` exists for `.github/workflows/publish_homebrew.yml`
   - Optional local fallback: Homebrew tap path is resolvable (`HOMEBREW_VOICETERM_PATH` or `brew --repo`)
4. Run `bundle.release`.
5. Run and wait for same-SHA `release_preflight.yml` success:

   ```bash
   gh workflow run release_preflight.yml -f version=<version>
   gh run list --workflow release_preflight.yml --limit 1
   # gh run watch <run-id>
   ```

   - `release_preflight.yml` must provide `GH_TOKEN` to steps that invoke
     `gh` inside `devctl check --profile release`; workflow uses
     `${{ github.token }}` for this wiring.
   - `release_preflight.yml` job must grant `security-events: write` so the
     zizmor SARIF upload step can publish scan results without permission
     failures.
   - `release_preflight.yml` uses `online-audits: false` for zizmor so
     cross-repo compare API restrictions do not hard-fail preflight in CI.
   - `release_preflight.yml` release security step must use
     `--python-scope changed` with the same resolved `--since-ref/--head-ref`
     range as AI-guard checks; do not run full-repo Python format/import scans
     in this lane.
   - `release_preflight.yml` release security step should not hard-block on
     repository-wide open CodeQL backlog (`--with-codeql-alerts`); keep CodeQL
     alert enforcement in dedicated security lanes and triage workflows.
   - In `release_preflight.yml`, `cargo deny` remains the blocking security
     gate; `devctl security` report output is retained as advisory evidence.

6. Run release tagging and notes:

   ```bash
   # Optional one-step metadata prep (Cargo/PyPI/app plist/changelog):
   python3 dev/scripts/devctl.py ship --version <version> --prepare-release
   python3 dev/scripts/devctl.py release --version <version>
   gh release create v<version> --title "v<version>" --notes-file /tmp/voiceterm-release-v<version>.md
   # PyPI publish runs automatically via .github/workflows/publish_pypi.yml.
   gh run list --workflow publish_pypi.yml --limit 1
   # Homebrew publish runs automatically via .github/workflows/publish_homebrew.yml.
   gh run list --workflow publish_homebrew.yml --limit 1
   # Native release binaries publish via .github/workflows/publish_release_binaries.yml.
   gh run list --workflow publish_release_binaries.yml --limit 1
   # Release source provenance attestations run via .github/workflows/release_attestation.yml.
   gh run list --workflow release_attestation.yml --limit 1
   # gh run watch <run-id>
   curl -fsSL https://pypi.org/pypi/voiceterm/<version>/json
   # Local fallback (if workflow is unavailable):
   python3 dev/scripts/devctl.py homebrew --version <version>
   ```

7. Run `bundle.post-push`.

Unified control plane alternatives:

```bash
# Workflow-first release convenience (only after same-SHA preflight success)
gh workflow run release_preflight.yml -f version=<version>
gh run list --workflow release_preflight.yml --limit 1
# gh run watch <run-id>
python3 dev/scripts/devctl.py ship --version <version> --verify --tag --notes --github --yes
# Workflow-first release path with auto metadata prep
python3 dev/scripts/devctl.py ship --version <version> --prepare-release --verify --tag --notes --github --yes
gh run list --workflow publish_pypi.yml --limit 1
gh run list --workflow publish_homebrew.yml --limit 1
gh run list --workflow publish_release_binaries.yml --limit 1
gh run list --workflow release_attestation.yml --limit 1

# Manual fallback (run PyPI/Homebrew locally)
python3 dev/scripts/devctl.py ship --version <version> --pypi --verify-pypi --homebrew --yes
```

## CI workflow dependency graph

## CI lane mapping (what must be green)

| Change signal | Lanes to verify |
|---|---|
| `rust/src/**` runtime changes | `rust_ci.yml` (Ubuntu main lane + MSRV `1.88.0` check + feature-mode matrix + macOS runtime smoke lane + high-signal Clippy lint-baseline gate) |
| Send mode/macros/transcript delivery | `voice_mode_guard.yml` |
| Wake-word runtime/detection | `wake_word_guard.yml` |
| Perf-sensitive paths | `perf_smoke.yml`, `latency_guard.yml` |
| Long-running worker/thread lifecycle | `memory_guard.yml` |
| Parser/ANSI/OSC boundary logic | `parser_fuzz_guard.yml` |
| Dependency/security policy changes | `security_guard.yml` |
| Dependency manifest/lockfile deltas in PRs | `dependency_review.yml` |
| Workflow syntax + policy drift | `workflow_lint.yml` |
| AI PR review signal ingestion and owner/severity rollups | `coderabbit_triage.yml` |
| Bounded AI remediation loop for CodeRabbit medium/high backlog | `coderabbit_ralph_loop.yml` |
| Bounded autonomous controller loop (checkpoint packets + queue artifacts + optional promote PR) | `autonomy_controller.yml` |
| Guarded plan-scoped autonomy swarm pipeline (scope load + swarm + reviewer + governance + plan evidence append) | `autonomy_run.yml` |
| Bounded mutation remediation loop (report-only default, optional policy-gated fix mode) | `mutation_ralph_loop.yml` |
| Release commit guard for unresolved CodeRabbit medium/high findings | `coderabbit_triage.yml`, `coderabbit_ralph_loop.yml`, `release_preflight.yml`, `publish_pypi.yml`, `publish_homebrew.yml`, `publish_release_binaries.yml`, `release_attestation.yml` |
| Supply-chain posture drift | `scorecard.yml` |
| Coverage reporting / Codecov badge freshness | `coverage.yml` (runs on every push to `develop`/`master` so branch-head badges do not go `unknown` after non-runtime commits) |
| Rust/Python source-file shape drift (God-file growth) | `tooling_control_plane.yml` |
| Multi-agent instruction/ack timers and stale-lane accountability | `tooling_control_plane.yml`, `orchestrator_watchdog.yml` |
| User docs/markdown changes | `docs_lint.yml` |
| Release preflight verification bundle | `release_preflight.yml` |
| GitHub release publication / PyPI distribution | `publish_pypi.yml` |
| GitHub release publication / Homebrew distribution | `publish_homebrew.yml` |
| GitHub release publication / native binaries | `publish_release_binaries.yml` |
| Release source provenance attestation | `release_attestation.yml` |
| Any non-success CI workflow run in watched lanes | `failure_triage.yml` (workflow-run triage bundle + artifact upload for high-signal failures in watched lanes; trusted same-repo events only, branch allowlist defaults to `develop,master` and can be overridden with repo variable `FAILURE_TRIAGE_BRANCHES`) |
| Tooling/process/docs governance surfaces (`dev/scripts/**`, `scripts/macro-packs/**`, `.github/workflows/**`, `AGENTS.md`, `dev/guides/DEVELOPMENT.md`, `dev/scripts/README.md`, `Makefile`) | `tooling_control_plane.yml` |
| Mutation-hardening work | `mutation-testing.yml` (scheduled; threshold is advisory/report-only across branches) plus local mutation-score evidence |

Runner-label note:
- Keep `publish_release_binaries.yml` on actionlint-supported macOS labels (`macos-15-intel` for darwin/amd64, `macos-14` for darwin/arm64).

Workflow hardening note:
- Keep `.github/workflows/scorecard.yml` workflow-level permissions read-only; set `id-token: write` and `security-events: write` at the job level so OpenSSF result publishing passes workflow verification.
- Keep GitHub-owned actions pinned to valid 40-character commit SHAs (for example `actions/attest-build-provenance` and `github/codeql-action/upload-sarif`).

## Documentation governance

Always evaluate:

- `dev/CHANGELOG.md` (required for user-facing behavior changes)
- `dev/active/INDEX.md`
- `dev/active/MASTER_PLAN.md`
- `README.md`
- `QUICK_START.md`
- `guides/USAGE.md`
- `guides/CLI_FLAGS.md`
- `guides/INSTALL.md`
- `guides/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`
- `dev/guides/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `dev/guides/DEVELOPMENT.md`
- `dev/scripts/README.md`
- `.github/workflows/README.md`
- `dev/audits/README.md`
- `dev/audits/AUTOMATION_DEBT_REGISTER.md`
- `dev/audits/METRICS_SCHEMA.md`
- `dev/integrations/EXTERNAL_REPOS.md`
- `dev/history/ENGINEERING_EVOLUTION.md` (required for tooling/process/CI shifts)

Plain-language rule for docs updates:

- For user/developer docs (`README.md`, `QUICK_START.md`, `guides/*`, `dev/*`), prefer plain language over policy-heavy wording.
- For workflow docs (`.github/workflows/README.md` + workflow header comments), explain purpose and trigger behavior in plain language.
- Use short, direct sentences and concrete commands.
- Keep technical accuracy, but avoid unnecessary jargon.

Update flow:

1. Link/adjust MP item in `dev/active/MASTER_PLAN.md`.
2. Update `dev/CHANGELOG.md` for user-facing behavior.
3. Update user docs for behavior/flag/UI changes.
4. Update developer docs for architecture/workflow/tooling changes.
5. Update screenshots/tables when UI output changes.
6. Add/update ADR when architecture decisions change.

Enforcement commands:

```bash
python3 dev/scripts/devctl.py docs-check --user-facing

## Tooling inventory

Canonical tool: `python3 dev/scripts/devctl.py ...`

Core commands:

- `check` (`ci`, `prepush`, `release`, `maintainer-lint`, `quick`, `fast`, `ai-guard`)
  - Runs setup gates (`fmt`, `clippy`, AI guard scripts) and test/build phases in parallel batches by default.
  - Use `--parallel-workers <n>` to tune worker count, or `--no-parallel` to force sequential execution.
  - Includes automatic orphaned/stale test-process cleanup before/after checks (`target/*/deps/voiceterm-*`, detached `PPID=1`, plus stale active runners aged `>=600s`).
  - Use `--no-process-sweep-cleanup` only when a run must preserve in-flight test processes.
  - Structured `check` output timestamps are UTC for stable cross-run correlation.
- `check-router` (path-aware lane selector that maps changed files to `bundle.docs|bundle.runtime|bundle.tooling|bundle.release`, reports required risk add-ons, and can execute the routed command set with `--execute`)
- `compat-matrix` (single-view host/provider compatibility matrix summary and policy validation surface)
  - Matrix checks now include a minimal no-dependency YAML fallback parser so
    tooling lanes remain deterministic when `PyYAML` is unavailable.
  - Malformed inline collection scalars in fallback mode now fail closed (no
    silent coercion), preserving guard reliability.
- `docs-check`
  - `--strict-tooling` also runs active-plan + multi-agent sync gates, markdown metadata-header checks, workflow-shell hygiene checks, bundle/workflow parity checks, plus stale-path audit so tooling/process changes cannot bypass active-doc/lane governance.
  - Check-script moves must be reflected in `dev/scripts/devctl/script_catalog.py` so strict-tooling path audits stay canonical.
- `hygiene` (archive/ADR/scripts governance plus orphaned/stale `target/debug/deps/voiceterm-*` test-process sweep, and report-retention drift warnings for stale managed `dev/reports/**` run artifacts; optional `--fix` removes detected `dev/scripts/**/__pycache__` directories)
- `path-audit` (stale-reference scan for legacy check-script paths; excludes `dev/archive/`)
- `path-rewrite` (auto-rewrite legacy check-script paths to canonical registry targets; use `--dry-run` first)
- `sync` (branch-sync automation with clean-tree, remote-ref, and `--ff-only` pull guards; optional `--push` for ahead branches)
- `integrations-sync` (policy-guarded sync/status for pinned federated sources under `integrations/`; supports remote update and audit logging)
- `integrations-import` (allowlisted selective importer from pinned federated sources into controlled destination roots with JSONL audit records)
- `cihub-setup` (allowlisted CIHub setup runner with preview/apply modes, capability probing, and strict unsupported-step gating)
- `security` (RustSec policy gate with optional workflow scan support via `--with-zizmor`, optional GitHub code-scanning alert gate via `--with-codeql-alerts`, and Python scope control via `--python-scope auto|changed|all`)
- `mutation-score` (reports outcomes source freshness; strict by default, or non-blocking reminders with `--report-only`; optional stale-data gate via `--max-age-hours`)
- `mutants`
- `release`
- `release-gates` (shared same-SHA release policy gate for CodeRabbit triage + release-preflight + Ralph checks; use `--skip-preflight` when running inside `release_preflight.yml`)
- `release-notes`
- `ship` (release-version reads now use TOML parsing for `[package]`/`[project]` with Python 3.10 fallback parsing)
- `pypi`
- `homebrew` (tap formula URL/version/checksum updates, canonical `desc` sync, and Cargo manifest-path migration sync to `libexec/rust/Cargo.toml` when legacy formulas still reference `libexec/src/Cargo.toml`)
- `status` (supports optional guarded Dev Mode log summaries via `--dev-logs`)
- `orchestrate-status` (single-view orchestrator summary for active-plan sync + multi-agent coordination guard state)
- `orchestrate-watch` (SLA watchdog for stale agent updates and overdue instruction ACKs)
- `report` (supports optional guarded Dev Mode log summaries via `--dev-logs`)
- `data-science` (builds one rolling telemetry snapshot from devctl audit events plus autonomy swarm/benchmark history, emits `summary.{md,json}` + SVG charts under `dev/reports/data_science/latest/`, and supports source/output overrides for experiments; devctl also auto-refreshes this snapshot after each command unless `DEVCTL_DATA_SCIENCE_DISABLE=1`)
- `triage` (human/AI triage output with optional CIHub artifact ingestion/bundle emission for owner/risk routing; report timestamps are UTC)
- `triage-loop` (bounded CodeRabbit medium/high loop with mode controls: `report-only`, `plan-then-fix`, `fix-only`; fix execution is policy-gated via `AUTONOMY_MODE`, branch allowlist, and command-prefix allowlist; emits md/json bundles and optional MASTER_PLAN proposal artifacts, with review-escalation comment upserts when attempts exhaust unresolved backlog)
- `loop-packet` (builds a guarded terminal feedback packet from triage/loop JSON sources for dev-mode draft injection with freshness/risk/auto-send-eligibility gates)
- `autonomy-loop` (bounded controller loop that orchestrates triage-loop + loop-packet rounds, emits checkpoint packets/queue artifacts, writes phone-ready status snapshots under `dev/reports/autonomy/queue/phone/`, and enforces policy-driven stop reasons; non-dry-run write modes require `AUTONOMY_MODE=operate`)
- `autonomy-benchmark` (active-plan-scoped swarm matrix runner for tactic/swarm-size tradeoff analysis; executes `autonomy-swarm` batches across configurable count/tactic grids, emits per-swarm and per-scenario productivity metrics, and writes benchmark bundles under `dev/reports/autonomy/benchmarks/<label>/`; non-report modes require `--fix-command`)
- `swarm_run` (guarded plan-scoped autonomy pipeline that derives next unchecked plan steps, runs `autonomy-swarm` with reviewer + post-audit defaults, executes governance checks (`check_active_plan_sync`, `check_multi_agent_sync`, `docs-check --strict-tooling`, `orchestrate-status/watch`), and appends run evidence to plan-doc `Progress Log` + `Audit Evidence`; supports optional multi-cycle execution (`--continuous --continuous-max-cycles`) to keep processing plan checklist scope until failure/limit; non-report modes require `--fix-command`)
- `autonomy-report` (builds a human-readable autonomy digest bundle from loop/watch artifacts under `dev/reports/autonomy/library/<label>` with summary markdown/json, copied sources, and optional matplotlib charts)
- `phone-status` (renders iPhone/SSH-safe autonomy status projections from `dev/reports/autonomy/queue/phone/latest.json` with selectable views `full|compact|trace|actions` and optional projection bundle emission: `full.json`, `compact.json`, `trace.ndjson`, `actions.json`, `latest.md`)
- `controller-action` (policy-gated operator action surface for `refresh-status`, `dispatch-report-only`, `pause-loop`, and `resume-loop`; dispatch and mode writes are bounded by workflow/branch allowlists and autonomy mode gates, with optional dry-run and mode-state artifact output)
- `autonomy-swarm` (adaptive multi-agent orchestration wrapper with metadata-driven worker sizing, optional `--plan-only` allocation mode, bounded per-agent autonomy-loop fanout, default reserved `AGENT-REVIEW` lane for post-audit review when execution runs with more than one lane, per-run swarm summary bundles under `dev/reports/autonomy/swarms/<label>/`, and default post-audit digest bundles under `dev/reports/autonomy/library/<label>-digest/`; disable with `--no-post-audit` and/or `--no-reviewer-lane`; non-report modes require `--fix-command`)
- `mutation-loop` (bounded mutation remediation loop with mode controls: `report-only`, `plan-then-fix`, `fix-only`; emits md/json/playbook bundles and supports policy-gated fix execution)
- `failure-cleanup` (guarded cleanup for local failure triage bundles under `dev/reports/failures`; default path-root guard, optional `--allow-outside-failure-root` constrained to `dev/reports/**`, CI-green gating with optional `--ci-branch`/`--ci-workflow`/`--ci-event`/`--ci-sha` filters, plus `--dry-run` and confirmation)
- `reports-cleanup` (retention-based cleanup for stale run artifacts under managed `dev/reports/**` roots with protected-path exclusions, dry-run preview, and explicit confirmation/`--yes` delete flow)
- `audit-scaffold`
  - Builds/updates `dev/reports/audits/RUST_AUDIT_FINDINGS.md` from Rust/Python guard failures.
  - Auto-runs when AI-guard checks fail.
  - Run manually when you want a fresh findings file or a commit-range scoped view.
- `list`

`check_code_shape.py` enforces both language-level limits and path-level
hotspot budgets, adds targeted function-length guardrails for dispatcher/
pipeline hotspots, and flags stale loose path overrides when files remain below
language soft limits for the configured review window.
`check_workflow_shell_hygiene.py` blocks fragile inline workflow shell patterns
(`find ... | head -n 1`, inline Python snippets) so helper bridges stay the
canonical workflow logic path.
`check_workflow_action_pinning.py` blocks non-SHA and dynamic `uses:` refs so
workflow actions stay pinned to immutable commits.
`check_agents_bundle_render.py` blocks drift between AGENTS rendered bundle
reference docs and canonical registry output; run with `--write` to regenerate
the section from `dev/scripts/devctl/bundle_registry.py`.
`check_bundle_workflow_parity.py` blocks registry/workflow command-bundle drift
by verifying `bundle.tooling` and `bundle.release` commands from
`dev/scripts/devctl/bundle_registry.py` still appear in their owning workflows.
`check_ide_provider_isolation.py` now runs in blocking mode by default and
allows mixed host/provider statements only in explicitly allowlisted policy
owner files.
`check_compat_matrix.py` + `compat_matrix_smoke.py` enforce machine-readable
host/provider compatibility metadata coverage and runtime enum smoke parity.
`check_naming_consistency.py` enforces canonical host/provider token alignment
across runtime enums, backend registry IDs, compatibility matrix policy sets,
and IDE/provider isolation token patterns.
`check_rust_test_shape.py` enforces non-regressive growth controls for Rust
test hotspots (`tests.rs` / `tests/**`) with path-specific budgets for known
large suites.
`check_active_plan_sync.py` enforces active-doc index/spec parity, mirrored-spec
phase heading and `MASTER_PLAN` link contracts, and `MASTER_PLAN` Status
Snapshot release freshness (branch policy + release-tag consistency).
`check_multi_agent_sync.py` enforces dynamic multi-agent coordination parity
between the `MASTER_PLAN` board and the runbook (lane/MP/worktree/branch alignment,
instruction/ack protocol validation, lane-lock + MP-collision handoff checks,
status/date format checks, ledger traceability, and end-of-cycle signoff when
all agent lanes are marked merged).
`check_rust_lint_debt.py` enforces non-regressive growth for `#[allow(...)]`
and non-test `unwrap/expect` call-sites in changed Rust files.
`check_rust_best_practices.py` blocks non-regressive growth of reason-less
`#[allow(...)]`, undocumented `unsafe { ... }` blocks, public `unsafe fn`
surfaces without `# Safety` docs, and `std::mem::forget`/`mem::forget` usage
in changed Rust files.
`check_rust_runtime_panic_policy.py` blocks non-regressive growth of runtime
`panic!` call-sites unless the new panic path is explicitly allowlisted with
`panic-policy: allow reason=...` rationale comments.
`check_clippy_high_signal.py` enforces baseline ceilings for selected
high-signal Clippy lints using lint-code histogram JSON from
`collect_clippy_warnings.py`.

## CI expansion policy

Add or extend CI when new risk classes are introduced:

- New latency-sensitive logic -> perf/latency guard coverage
- New long-running threads/workers -> memory loop/soak coverage
- New release/distribution mechanics -> release/homebrew/pypi validation
- New user modes/flags -> at least one integration lane exercises them
- New dependency/supply-chain exposure -> security policy coverage
- New parser/control-sequence boundary logic -> property-fuzz coverage
- New/edited workflows must keep action refs SHA-pinned (`uses: org/action@<40-hex>`)
  and declare explicit `permissions:` + `concurrency:` blocks.

## Mandatory self-review checklist

Before calling implementation done, review for:

- Security: injection, unsafe input handling, secret exposure
- Memory: unbounded buffers, leaks, large allocations
- Error handling: unwrap/expect in non-test code, missing failure paths
- Concurrency: deadlocks, races, lock contention
- Performance: unnecessary allocations, blocking in hot paths
- Style/maintenance: clippy warnings, naming, dead code
- API/docs alignment: Rust reference checks captured for non-trivial changes
- CI supply chain: workflow refs pinned, permissions least-privilege, concurrency set
- CI runtime hardening: workflows define explicit `timeout-minutes` budgets for long-running/security-sensitive jobs

## Handoff paper trail protocol

For substantive sessions, use `dev/guides/DEVELOPMENT.md` -> `Handoff paper trail template`.
Include:

- exact commands run
- docs decisions (`updated` or `no change needed`)
- screenshot decisions
- Rust references consulted (for non-trivial Rust changes)
- follow-up MP IDs

## Archive and ADR policy

- Keep `dev/archive/` immutable (no deletions/rewrites).
- Keep active execution in `dev/active/MASTER_PLAN.md`.
- Use `dev/adr/` for architecture decisions.
- Keep ADR numbering governance metadata current in `dev/adr/README.md`
  (`Retired ADR IDs`, `Reserved ADR IDs`, and `next: NNNN`).
- Supersede ADRs with new ADRs; do not rewrite old ADR history.

## End-of-session checklist

- [ ] Mandatory SOP steps were completed.
- [ ] Verification commands passed for scope.
- [ ] Docs updated per governance checklist.
- [ ] `dev/CHANGELOG.md` updated if behavior is user-facing.
- [ ] `dev/active/MASTER_PLAN.md` updated.
- [ ] Repeat-to-automate outcomes captured (new automation or debt-register entry).
- [ ] Follow-up work captured as MP items.
- [ ] Handoff summary captured.
- [ ] Root `--*` artifact check run and clean.
- [ ] Git state is clean or intentionally staged/committed.

## Notes

- `dev/archive/2026-01-29-claudeaudit-completed.md` contains the production readiness checklist.
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones.
