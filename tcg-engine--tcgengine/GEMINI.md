# TCGEngine — Repo Instructions & Developer Guide

This document provides a concise developer-oriented guide to the repository, with focused guidance for editing Decision Queue and Turn / Next-Turn code paths. Keep this file updated as you change behavior or generator outputs.

## Quick links (files to know)
- `Core/DecisionQueueController.php` — server-side logic that executes static decision-queue entries and invokes custom handlers.
- `Core/UILibraries.js` — client-side rendering pipeline used by the generated UI (PopulateZone, createCardHTML, card injection points).
- `zzGameCodeGenerator.php` — schema parser + code generator that produces server helpers and a `GeneratedUI_*.js` client helper.
- `Schemas/<RootName>/GameSchema.txt` — schema defining zones, overlays, counters and display properties.
- `<RootName>/GeneratedUI_*.js` — generated client helpers (watch for the timestamped filename in the game folder).
- `<RootName>/ZoneAccessors.php`, `ZoneClasses.php`, `GamestateParser.php` — generated server-side gamestate helpers.
- `<RootName>/GetNextTurn.php`, `NextTurnRender.php`, `InitialLayout.php` — important generated files used by runtime.
- `<RootName>/Custom/*` (e.g. `RBSim/Custom/GameLogic.php`) — custom game logic where customDQHandlers are normally registered.

## High-level flow
1. Authoritative schema: `Schemas/<Root>/GameSchema.txt`.
2. Run the generator: `zzGameCodeGenerator.php?rootName=<Root>` (open via your dev host or run via CLI if you have a local PHP webserver). The generator parses the schema and writes the generated PHP files and the client `GeneratedUI_<timestamp>.js` into `./<Root>`.
3. The frontend includes `InitialLayout.php` and the generated `GeneratedUI_*.js`. The `GeneratedUI_*.js` contains `GetZoneData()`, `OverlayRules`, `CounterRules`, and other generated helpers.
4. `Core/UILibraries.js` (client) uses those helpers to render zones (`PopulateZone`) and per-card HTML (`createCardHTML`). We inject counters and overlays at well-known insertion points in `createCardHTML`.

If you change the schema or generator, re-run the generator and hard-refresh the browser so the client receives the updated `GeneratedUI_*.js` (the generator deletes old `GeneratedUI_*.js` files and writes a new timestamped one).

## Decision Queue — server-side (how it works)
- File: `Core/DecisionQueueController.php`.
- Core concept: each player has a `DecisionQueue` zone (parsed from schema). Objects placed into that zone are processed by `DecisionQueueController::ExecuteStaticMethods()` to perform static, immediate actions that do not require interactive input.

Key points:
- `ExecuteStaticMethods($player, $lastDecision)` iterates the player's queue and handles specific decision Types (e.g., `MZMOVE`, `CUSTOM`).
- For `CUSTOM` decisions the code currently does:

  - split the `Param` string on `|` to produce parts
  - `array_shift` the first element to get the handler name
  - call the registered handler with signature: `$customDQHandlers[$handlerName]($player, $parts, $lastDecision)`

  So: the handler receives `$player` (int), `$parts` (an array of the remaining params — reindexed starting at 0), and `$lastDecision` (string|null). This is the canonical place to add short, non-interactive flows.

How to add a custom handler
1. Register handlers in your game's custom logic file (e.g. `RBSim/Custom/GameLogic.php`) near where `$customDQHandlers` is defined. Example:

```php
$customDQHandlers = [];
$customDQHandlers["DealDamage"] = function($player, $params, $lastDecision) {
    // $params is an array of strings (the parts after the handler name)
    // Example usage: $targetZone = $params[0]; $amount = intval($params[1]);
    // Implement small, stateless actions here. Keep them short and idempotent.
};
```

2. When you queue the decision (AddDecision) ensure the `Param` string format matches how the handler expects it: e.g. `DealDamage|myBattlefield-3|2` (handlerName|targetMZ|amount). The generator/renderer may serialize things differently; inspect how decisions are enqueued in your game flow.

Important notes and gotchas
- `ExecuteStaticMethods` will `PopDecision($player)` after executing the recognized static action — make sure handlers do not assume the decision remains in the queue.
- Only use `CUSTOM` static handlers for short immediate changes; interactive decisions should use other decision Types (YESNO, MZCHOOSE, etc.).
- Handlers must be tolerant of malformed parameters (validate array indexes, numeric conversion). Prefer failing silently and logging rather than throwing unhandled exceptions that could kill the loop.

## Turn controller / generator notes
- The generator (`zzGameCodeGenerator.php`) outputs a number of server files and a key client JS file (`GeneratedUI_<timestamp>.js`). Important generator behaviours:
  - It emits `OverlayRules` and `CounterRules` as `const` JS objects in the generated JS. Client code reads these constants for overlays/counters.
  - It emits zone metadata accessible by `GetZoneData(zoneName)` on the client.
  - It deletes old `GeneratedUI_*.js` files in the target folder and writes a new timestamped copy.

## Where to change things (map of responsibilities)
- Decision queue static behavior: `Core/DecisionQueueController.php::ExecuteStaticMethods()`
- Register game-specific handlers: `<RootName>/Custom/GameLogic.php` (see `$customDQHandlers` array)
- Additional activation costs: `<RootName>/Custom/GameLogic.php` (see `$additionalActivationCosts` array + `DeclareAdditionalCost` handler)
- Generator parsing & code emission: `zzGameCodeGenerator.php` (Counters, Overlays, Zone metadata, GeneratedUI emission)
- Client rendering: `Core/UILibraries.js` (PopulateZone, createCardHTML, CreateCountersHTML, overlays injection)
- Endpoint that serves next-turn data: generated `<RootName>/GetNextTurn.php` (see `zzGameCodeGenerator.php` which writes this file)

## Card Ability Implementation Workflow (for AI agents)

This is the canonical workflow for implementing card abilities. Follow these steps in order.

### CRITICAL RULES
- **NEVER manually edit `<RootName>/GeneratedCode/GeneratedMacroCode.php`** — this file is auto-generated from the database. The MCP `save_card_abilities` tool saves to the DB and triggers the code generator automatically. Any manual edits will be overwritten.
- **NEVER manually edit `<RootName>/GeneratedCode/GeneratedMacroCount.js`** — same reason.
- Helper functions that don't already exist should be added to the appropriate file in `<RootName>/Custom/` based on theme (e.g. combat helpers in CombatLogic.php, general helpers in GameLogic.php).
- **Prefer generated prereqs/restrictions over manual runtime guards** — if a card-local play/activation restriction can be expressed as a generated prereq (`CanActivateAbility`, generated macro prereq arrays, schema macro prereq hooks), implement it there first so UI button state, legality checks, and execution stay in sync. Reserve manual guards in `DoActivateCard` / `DoActivatedAbility` for cross-card framework logic or cases the macro layer cannot yet express cleanly.
- **Prefer generated numerical modifier macros for scalar cost math** — Grand Archive now supports `MemoryCostModifier`, `ReserveCostModifier`, `PlayCostModifier`, and `ActivationCostModifier` schema macros (`MacroType=ValueModifier`). Use these for card-driven +/- cost logic before extending manual switchboards in `GameLogic.php`.
- **Modifier macro return contract** — modifier abilities may return either an `int` delta or an array like `['delta' => -1, 'consume' => true, 'applied' => true]`. The generated evaluator passes results through `ParseModifierResult(...)`; `consume` removes the source effect only when the modifier actually applied.
- **Per-card stat modifiers** — continuous effects that raise/lower a single card's POWER, HP, or Level should be implemented by:
  1. Using `AddTurnEffect($mzCard, $effectID)` to tag the card with the effect when the ability resolves.
  2. Adding a `case "$effectID":` to the relevant `ObjectCurrentPower`, `ObjectCurrentHP`, or `ObjectCurrentLevel` switch in `GameLogic.php`.
  The effect is automatically cleared at end of turn by `ExpireEffects`.
  3. When creating effect ids, make it be the card id plus a dash and suffix (if that card needs multiple distinct effects or other information encoded)
- **Field-presence passives** (e.g. "champion gets +1 level while you control X") belong in `ObjectCurrentLevel`/`ObjectCurrentPower`/`ObjectCurrentHP`. Use the established pattern: loop the field once, switch on card ID, deduplicate with `$appliedPassives[$fID]` to prevent duplicate copies from stacking inadvertently.
- **Runtime card overrides** ("becomes a Phantasia", "loses all abilities", "cards in graveyards are NORM element") — use `ApplyPersistentOverride($mzCard, $overrides)` to store indefinite overrides in `$obj->Counters['_overrides']`. For temporary end-of-turn suppression, use `AddTurnEffect($mzCard, 'NO_ABILITIES')`. Always use `EffectiveCardType/Subtype/Classes/Element($obj)` (never raw `CardType($obj->CardID)` etc.) when querying field objects in Custom/*.php — the Effective* wrappers check these overrides automatically.

### Step 1: Gather card information
Call the MCP `get_card_info` tool with the card ID to get the card's name, effect text, element, type, cost, and other metadata.

### Step 2: Discover the zone schema
Call the MCP `get_zone_schema` tool to understand what properties exist on cards in each zone. Key facts for Grand Archive:
- **Field zone** has: `CardID`, `Status` (1=exhausted, 2=ready), `Owner`, `Damage` (integer counter), `Controller`, `TurnEffects` (array of effect IDs)
- Champions are on the Field, just like allies. They are distinguished by `CardType == "CHAMPION"`.
- Champion damage is tracked via the `Damage` property on the champion object in the field, NOT via `GetHealth()`. The `Health` zone is a legacy artifact.
- **Memory zone** has only: `CardID`
- **Graveyard, Hand, Deck** have only: `CardID`

### Step 3: Find existing helper functions
Call the MCP `get_helper_functions` tool to discover what helper functions already exist. Search with relevant terms. Key helpers for Grand Archive include:
- `ZoneSearch(zoneName, cardTypes, floatingMemoryOnly, cardElements, cardSubtypes)` — search a zone by type/element/subtype. All params after `zoneName` are optional and can be passed by name (e.g. `ZoneSearch("myField", ["ALLY"], cardSubtypes: ["ANIMAL", "BEAST"])`). If the card is a spell, you'll need to use FilterSpellshroudTargets to filter the results.
- `DealChampionDamage(player, amount)` — add damage to the player's champion on the field
- `RecoverChampion(player, amount)` — remove damage from the player's champion on the field
- `DealDamage(player, source, target, amount)` — deal damage from a source to a target (via macro)
- `Draw(player, amount)` — draw cards (macro call, preferred over DoDrawCard)
- `MZMove(player, mzCard, destZone)` — move a card between zones
- `IsClassBonusActive(player, classes)` — check if champion's class matches
- `AddGlobalEffects(player, effectID)` — add a global effect that affects all matching cards this turn (via `doesGlobalEffectApply` / `CardCurrentEffects`)
- `AddTurnEffect(mzCard, effectID)` — add a per-card turn effect to a specific field card's `TurnEffects` array. Use this when the effect targets a single card (e.g. "+2 POWER until end of turn on a specific ally") rather than `AddGlobalEffects` which broadcasts to all matching cards. The effect ID is conventionally the source card's ID. It is cleared at end of turn by `ExpireEffects`.
- `ProcessSplitDamage(player, source, assignmentStr)` — process the comma-separated `mzID:amount` result from MZSplitAssign, calling `DealDamage` for each non-zero assignment
- `Delevel(player)` — delevel the player's champion by returning its current card to material deck and promoting the top subcard. Returns false if champion has no lineage.
- `ExhaustCard(player, mzID)` — exhaust a card
- `WakeupCard(player, mzID)` — ready a card
- `ObjectCurrentPower(obj)`, `ObjectCurrentHP(obj)` — get computed stats
- `CardElement(cardID)`, `CardType(cardID)`, `CardClasses(cardID)` — card dictionary lookups
- `MacroNameCallCount($player)` — how many times a macro was invoked for a player this turn. Every generated macro has a corresponding `*CallCount($player)` helper (e.g. `CardActivatedCallCount($player)`, `EnterCallCount($player)`). These read from `MacroTurnIndex` and are reset at the start of each turn. Useful for cards that depend on how many times you did something this turn.
- `HasNoAbilities($obj)` — returns true if a field object has the `NO_ABILITIES` TurnEffect (temporary) or `$obj->Counters['_overrides']['NO_ABILITIES']` (persistent). All keyword wrappers and ability dispatch already check this automatically; you don't need to guard code manually.
- `EffectiveCardType($obj)` / `EffectiveCardSubtypes($obj)` / `EffectiveCardClasses($obj)` / `EffectiveCardElement($obj)` — get a field object's runtime-overridden type/subtypes/classes/element. Always use these (not raw `CardType($obj->CardID)` etc.) when querying field objects in Custom/*.php code.
- `ApplyPersistentOverride($mzCard, $overrides)` — write indefinite overrides into `$obj->Counters['_overrides']`. Keys are `type`, `subtypes`, `classes`, `element`, `NO_ABILITIES`, `granted_keywords` (array of keyword names). Overrides survive serialization and persist until the card leaves the field. Used by Fracturize.
- `HasGrantedKeyword($obj, $keyword)` — check for a keyword explicitly granted by a persistent override (e.g. `'Reservable'`). This bypasses `HasNoAbilities`, so a Fracturized card can still be reserved.
- `ZoneContainsCardID($zoneName, $cardID)` — scan a zone for a card ID; used by field-presence passives (e.g. Nullifying Lantern's graveyard-element override in `EffectiveCardElement`).

### Step 4: Study existing examples
Call the MCP `get_implemented_examples` tool with the relevant macro name (e.g. "CardActivated", "Enter", `ActivationCostModifier`, `MemoryCostModifier`) to see how similar abilities are coded. This shows you the exact pattern to follow.

### Step 5: Write the ability code

**Key Point:** Write ONLY the function body (closure body). The code generator automatically wraps your code in:
```php
$enterAbilities["cardID:0"] = function($player) {
  // YOUR CODE HERE
};
```
or
```php
$cardActivatedAbilities["cardID:0"] = function($player) {
  // YOUR CODE HERE
};
```

So in the ability code, you have access to:
- `$player` — the player who owns/activated the card
- `DecisionQueueController::GetVariable("mzID")` — the mzID of the card (auto-retrieved by generator)
- Any helper functions from Step 3
- **Await syntax** for player choices (see Multi-Step Ability Patterns below):
  - `$var = await $player.MZChoose("zone-0&zone-1")` — mandatory card choice
  - `$var = await $player.MZMayChoose("zone-0&zone-1")` — optional card choice
  - `$var = await $player.MZMultiChoose($targets, $min, $max, "tooltip")` — select between `$min` and `$max` cards in one popup; returns an `&`-delimited mzID string or `"-"`
  - `$var = await $player.YesNo("prompt")` — yes/no choice
  - `$var = await $player.NumberChoose(min, max, "prompt")` — choose a number in a range
  - `$var = await $player.MZSplitAssign($targets, $amount, "prompt")` — split-assign a pool across targets. Returns comma-separated `mzID:amount` pairs (e.g. `"myField-0:3,myField-1:2"`). `$targets` is an `&`-delimited mzID string, `$amount` is the total pool to assign.
  - `await FunctionName($player, $args)` — call a function that queues decisions

**Critical await constraints:**
The code generator splits your ability code at each `await` line. Pre-await code goes into the main ability function; post-await code goes into a custom DQ handler. **Braces, variables, and scope do NOT carry across the split.** This means:
  - **NO await inside conditionals or loops.** Ever. Use early `return` statements to flatten control flow so `await` is always at top level.
  - **NO variables used after await** that were computed before it. The generator cannot propagate them across function boundaries. Recompute any needed values after the await (in the handler section).
  - **NO function calls as await parameters.** Pre-compute into a variable: `$str = implode("&", $arr);` then `await $player.MZChoose($str)`.
  - **NO tooltip parameter as second arg to MZChoose/MZMayChoose.** The await syntax does not support `await $player.MZChoose($targetStr, "tooltip")` — the generator produces broken PHP. Omit it: just `await $player.MZChoose($targetStr)`.

**Correct pattern:** Early returns + pre-computed variables + top-level await
```php
if(empty($targets)) return;                  // Early return instead of nested if
$targetStr = implode("&", $targets);         // Pre-compute before await
$chosen = await $player.MZChoose($targetStr); // await at top level
// After await, use $chosen and $mzID (auto-retrieved), but recompute other values
```

### Step 6: Save via MCP
Call `save_card_abilities` with the card ID, macro name, and ability code. The MCP server saves to the database AND automatically runs the code generator, so `GeneratedMacroCode.php` is updated.

**Important:** `save_card_abilities` auto-generates the macro code (e.g., `cardActivatedAbilities["cardID:0"] = function($player) { ... }`), but you remain responsible for any custom GameLogic.php edits:
- If using `AddGlobalEffects(...)`, you must manually add a filter in `$doesGlobalEffectApply[$cardID]` if the effect applies conditionally (e.g., only to allies).
- If adding per-turn stat modifiers via `AddGlobalEffects`, manually add a `case "$cardID":` to `ObjectCurrentPower`, `ObjectCurrentHP`, or `ObjectCurrentLevel` to declare the modifier.
- If registering custom DQ handlers in the ability code (e.g., to handle multi-step flows), ensure those handlers exist in `Custom/GameLogic.php` (the generator will wrap them but won't invent new handlers).
- If a card's scalar cost change can be expressed as a generated value modifier, prefer saving a `MemoryCostModifier` / `ReserveCostModifier` / `PlayCostModifier` / `ActivationCostModifier` ability instead of editing manual cost-calculation code in `GameLogic.php`.

### Multi-Step Ability Patterns (YesNo, Target Selection)

**Pattern:** When an ability requires player input (YesNo, card choice), write ability code that *queues* decisions rather than awaiting inline. The generator will compile these into custom DQ handlers.

**Example: Card with YesNo + target selection**
```php
// Ability code (write only the body — generator wraps in function($player) { })
$targetSelf = await $player.YesNo("Target_yourself?");
$deckRef = $targetSelf == "YES" ? "myDeck" : "theirDeck";
$gravRef = $targetSelf == "YES" ? "myGraveyard" : "theirGraveyard";
for($i = 0; $i < 3; ++$i) {
    if(empty(ZoneSearch($deckRef))) break;
    MZMove($player, $deckRef . "-0", $gravRef);
}
```

The generator translates `await` statements into queued `DecisionQueueController::AddDecision()` calls. Each `await` becomes:
1. A decision queue entry (YESNO, MZCHOOSE, or MZMAYCHOOSE)
2. A custom DQ handler that processes the player's response

The `lastDecision` parameter in the handler receives the player's choice ("YES"/"NO" for YesNo, or the mzID for card choices).

### MZMultiChoose — Single Popup Multi-Select Pattern

**Decision type:** `MZMULTICHOOSE` — lets the player select a configurable minimum/maximum number of cards in one popup instead of repeating `MZCHOOSE` prompts.

**Await syntax:** `$var = await $player.MZMultiChoose($targets, $min, $max, "tooltip")`
- `$targets`: `&`-delimited mzID string (for example `"myMemory-0&myMemory-1&myMemory-2"`)
- `$min`: minimum number of required selections
- `$max`: maximum number of allowed selections
- `"tooltip"` (optional): underscore-separated prompt shown in the popup

**Return value:** `&`-delimited selected mzIDs, for example `"myMemory-0&myMemory-2"`. Returns `"-"` when zero selections are allowed and the player confirms none.

**UI behavior:** A single popup shows all candidate cards, highlights selected cards, displays the current selection count, and enforces the configured min/max before confirm.

**Example — reveal any number of wind cards from memory:**
```php
$choices = ZoneSearch("myMemory", cardElements: ["WIND"]);
if(empty($choices)) return;
$targetStr = implode("&", $choices);
$selected = await $player.MZMultiChoose($targetStr, 0, count($choices), "Reveal_any_number_of_wind_cards_from_memory");
if($selected === "-") return;
foreach(explode("&", $selected) as $chosen) {
  if($chosen === "") continue;
  Reveal($chosen);
}
```

**When to use vs. repeated `MZCHOOSE`:** Use `MZMultiChoose` when the player should choose several cards from one visible candidate set in a single interaction. Keep repeated `MZCHOOSE` flows for stepwise decisions where each pick changes the next legal set or needs separate processing between picks.

### MZRearrange — Ordered Top/Bottom Pile Pattern

**Decision type:** `MZREARRANGE` — lets the player drag revealed card IDs between named piles and order cards within each pile.

**When to prefer it:** Use `MZREARRANGE` for "put the rest on the top or bottom in any order" and for bottom-only reorder flows after looking at or revealing cards from deck/temp zone. Do not fake these rearrangement UIs with `MZMultiChoose`.

**Parameter format:** `"Top=cardA,cardB;Bottom=cardC"` where each pile is a comma-separated list of card IDs.

**Common patterns:**
- Top-or-bottom reorder: `Top=<ids>;Bottom=`
- Bottom-only reorder: `Top=;Bottom=<ids>`

**Queue pattern:**
```php
$param = "Top=;Bottom=" . implode(",", $remaining);
DecisionQueueController::AddDecision($player, "MZREARRANGE", $param, 1, "Put_remaining_on_bottom_of_deck_in_any_order");
DecisionQueueController::AddDecision($player, "CUSTOM", "MyRearrangeApply", 1);
```

**Apply pattern:** Parse `$lastDecision` by `;` and `=`, remove the temp-zone objects, then append `Bottom` pile cards to deck and handle `Top` pile explicitly when that mode is allowed. For bottom-only flows, append `array_merge($piles["Bottom"], $piles["Top"])` so misplaced cards still resolve safely.

### MZSplitAssign — Split Damage / Split Pool Pattern

**Decision type:** `MZSPLITASSIGN` — lets the player distribute a numeric pool (e.g., damage) across multiple card targets on the board.

**Await syntax:** `$var = await $player.MZSplitAssign($targets, $amount, "tooltip")`
- `$targets`: `&`-delimited mzID string (e.g. `"myField-0&theirField-2"`)
- `$amount`: integer pool to distribute
- `"tooltip"` (optional): underscore-separated prompt shown in the UI

**Return value:** Comma-separated `mzID:amount` pairs for non-zero assignments, e.g. `"myField-0:3,theirField-1:2"`. Returns `"-"` if the player had no valid targets.

**Processing the result:** Use `ProcessSplitDamage($player, $source, $assignmentStr)` to deal damage for each assignment. This is a shared helper in `GameLogic.php` that calls `DealDamage()` for each non-zero pair.

**Full example — deal N damage split among all units:**
```php
$allUnits = array_merge(
    ZoneSearch("myField", ["ALLY", "CHAMPION"]),
    ZoneSearch("theirField", ["ALLY", "CHAMPION"])
);
$allUnits = FilterSpellshroudTargets($allUnits);
if(empty($allUnits)) return;
$targetStr = implode("&", $allUnits);
$assignments = await $player.MZSplitAssign($targetStr, $damageAmount, "Split_damage_among_units");
ProcessSplitDamage($player, $mzID, $assignments);
```

**UI behavior:** Inline overlay on each target card with +/− buttons and a counter. A bottom banner shows the remaining pool. The Confirm button is disabled until the entire pool is assigned (all-or-nothing).

**When to use vs. repeated MZCHOOSE:** Use `MZSplitAssign` when the total pool can be split freely. Use repeated `MZCHOOSE` when each "instance" must be a fixed amount (e.g., "for each card banished, choose a unit and deal 2 damage to it").

### TWOSIDEDSLIDER — Numeric Split Between Two Outcomes

**Decision type:** `TWOSIDEDSLIDER` — lets the player choose a numeric split between two outcomes in one compact chooser instead of repeated `YESNO` or one-choice modal prompts.

**Queue syntax:** `DecisionQueueController::AddDecision($player, "TWOSIDEDSLIDER", "min|max|leftSpec|rightSpec", 1, tooltip:"Prompt_text");`
- `min`, `max`: inclusive integer range for the left-side count.
- `leftSpec`, `rightSpec`: one of `label~Caption_text`, `card~CARDID`, or `cardlabel~CARDID~Caption_text`.

**Return value:** the chosen left-side count as a string. The right-side count is `max - chosen`.

**When to use:** Prefer this when one effect produces `N` identical replacement events and the player should choose how many become option A versus option B.

### Additional Activation Costs (optional reserve at activation time)

Some cards say "As an additional cost to activate this card, you may pay (N)." These costs are declared and paid **at activation time** (Grand Archive rules step 1.3), before the opponent gets priority, not at resolution time inside the ability.

**Framework:** `$additionalActivationCosts` in `GameLogic.php` — a registry mapping `cardID` to cost config.

**How it works:**
1. `DoActivateCard()` checks `$additionalActivationCosts[$cardID]` after computing the base reserve cost.
2. If the entry exists and its `condition` callback returns true and the player has enough cards in hand, a YESNO decision is queued.
3. The `DeclareAdditionalCost` DQ handler processes the answer, stores `"additionalCostPaid"` as `"YES"` or `"NO"`, then queues all reserve payments (base + extra if YES) followed by `EffectStackOpportunity`.
4. At resolution time, ability code reads `DecisionQueueController::GetVariable("additionalCostPaid")` to branch.

**To register a new additional cost:**
```php
$additionalActivationCosts["<cardID>"] = [
    'prompt'       => 'Pay_N_extra_for_effect?',   // YesNo prompt text
    'extraReserve' => 2,                            // extra hand→memory payments
    'condition'    => function($player) {            // optional — when to offer
        return !empty(ZoneSearch("myGraveyard", cardElements: ["CRUX"]));
    }
];
```

**In the ability code** (saved via `save_card_abilities`), check the result:
```php
$additionalCostPaid = DecisionQueueController::GetVariable("additionalCostPaid");
if($additionalCostPaid === "YES") {
    // additional-cost-specific effects (e.g. banish self, recover card)
}
```

**Important:** The cost payment (hand→memory) is handled automatically by the framework. The ability code should only implement the *effects* that happen when the additional cost was paid — do NOT re-implement the reserve payment inside ability code.

### Step 7: Add any new helper functions
If the card requires a new helper function (like `RecoverChampion`), add it to the appropriate Custom/*.php file. Group by theme:
- Combat-related → `CombatLogic.php`
- Materialize-related → `MaterializeLogic.php`
- General game logic → `GameLogic.php`
- Card-specific complex logic → `CardLogic.php`

### Step 8: Prefer Framework Hooks Before Manual Switchboards

Before editing large manual switchboards in `GameLogic.php`, check whether the behavior belongs in one of the generated framework hooks instead:
- **Restrictions / legality** — generated macro prereqs such as `CanActivateAbility` and other prereq arrays for card-local restrictions.
- **Scalar cost changes** — `MemoryCostModifier`, `ReserveCostModifier`, `PlayCostModifier`, `ActivationCostModifier`.
- **One-shot consumable modifiers** — return `['delta' => ..., 'consume' => true]` so the framework can remove the source effect after a successful application.

Manual `GameLogic.php` edits are still appropriate for:
- Cross-card framework rules that affect many cards at once.
- Costs that are not simple scalar modifiers, such as `REST`, sacrifice, banish, discard, reveal, or multi-step alternative payment flows.
- Cases where the current generated macro surface cannot represent the rule without awkward or fragile workarounds.
