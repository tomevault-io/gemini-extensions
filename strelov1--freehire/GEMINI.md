# AGENTS.md

Guidance for AI agents working in this repository.

## Working principles

- **No overengineering, and no MVP shortcuts.** Hold the middle path: don't build infrastructure before there's a concrete need (note the seam for later instead), and don't ship quick-and-dirty or "for now" hacks. Build each feature correctly and idiomatically — neither gold-plated nor a placeholder.
- **MVP stage — keep the architecture fluid.** The current structure is not load-bearing legacy. When a new feature doesn't fit cleanly, prefer reshaping the affected part over bolting on an awkward special case.
- **Surgical changes.** Clean up what your change orphaned; leave pre-existing dead code alone. Prefer a library's intended API over a clever shim.
- **English only.** All code, comments, identifiers, docs, and commits.
- **Announce shipped work.** When a user-facing feature or fix lands, offer a changelog entry on the `/blog` feed, then a longer post if it warrants one (`.svx` files in `web/src/posts/`; the `write-changelog` skill drafts them). Skip for internal-only changes.

## What this is

`freehire` ([freehire.me](https://freehire.me)) is an open-source IT job aggregator. Many source parsers feed a pipeline that normalizes jobs into one schema, deduplicates them, and enriches them with AI; served over an HTTP API with rich filters, consumed by a SvelteKit app under `web/`.

Stack: **Go + Fiber v2**, **PostgreSQL**, **sqlc**, **Meilisearch**, **Docker Compose**, **langchaingo**.

## Layout

`internal/<domain>/` — domain packages, the substantial ones carry their own AGENTS.md (see the table below).
`cmd/<name>/` — every binary is a **run-once-and-exit** worker except `cmd/server`. They are cron-driven, not daemons; they need `DATABASE_URL` and exit non-zero on failure.

Non-obvious:

- `migrations/` — the source for **both** sqlc codegen and Postgres initdb. Never edit an applied migration; add a new file.
- `sources/` — YAML board files, not Go. One file per ATS provider, plus `custom.yml` and `telegram.yml`.
- `design-system/` — a separate pnpm package, sibling to `web/`, linked via `link:../design-system`
  (a symlink, not a copy). **Install it before building `web/`** — pnpm does not install a
  linked package's own dependencies.
- `internal/db/` — **generated**; edit `internal/db/queries/*.sql` and run `make sqlc`.
- `services/pii-filter` — a standalone service, not a Go package.

## Commands

```bash
make up / make down / make logs       # start / stop / tail app + postgres in Docker
make run / make psql / make sqlc      # run server on host / psql into DB / regenerate internal/db
make reindex                          # rebuild the Meilisearch jobs index from Postgres
go build ./...  &&  go vet ./...
go test ./...                             # unit tests (no external deps)
go vet -tags=integration ./...            # compiles the tagged tests — run before EVERY push
go test -tags=integration ./internal/db/  # queue integration tests (needs Docker; testcontainers)
```

**`go test ./...` compiles no `//go:build integration` file, and those files are not
confined to `internal/db`** — there are 152 of them across 13 packages, and `internal/handler`
holds 65, which call unexported constructors like `newCVHandlers`. A changed signature
therefore passes every command above except the `vet` line, then fails CI, which runs
`go test -tags=integration ./...` over the whole module. The vet line is the cheap guard:
seconds, no Docker. Run the full tagged suite when you change behaviour rather than a
signature.

Worker gotchas (`go run ./cmd/<name>`, all need `DATABASE_URL`; run `ls cmd/` for the full list):

- `migrate` — run **before** deploying code that reads new schema. `-baseline` records on-disk files without executing; a pre-runner database auto-baselines on first run.
- `ingest` — takes one board file: `go run ./cmd/ingest sources/<provider>.yml` (or `SOURCES_FILE`).
- `enrich` / `tg-extract` — need `LLM_BASE_URL` / `LLM_API_KEY` / `LLM_MODEL`.
- `embed` / `search-drain` / `rollup-facets` / `reindex-companies` — need `MEILI_URL` / `MEILI_MASTER_KEY`. `search-drain` drains `search_outbox` (queued by `cmd/ingest`, atomically with each write) into the live facet index in batches — run it frequently (e.g. every 1-2 min); see [internal/searchdrain/AGENTS.md](internal/searchdrain/AGENTS.md).
- `backfill-derive` — re-derives every deterministic column (facets, `role_fingerprint`, slugs) in one keyset pass; `BACKFILL_CONCURRENCY` tunes the pool. Follow with `make reindex` — it collapses newly-clustered reposts and unions their geography.
- `capture-apply-form` — drains the apply-form capture queue: fetches each queued posting's application form from `greenhouse`/`ashby`/`workable`/`lever` and stores it in `apply_forms`. Needs nothing but `DATABASE_URL`; `APPLY_FORM_CONCURRENCY` (default 4) bounds how hard one run leans on a platform and `APPLY_FORM_MAX_PER_RUN` (default 5000) how much of the backlog it takes — the second matters because the first drain faces a ~185k backlog and an unbounded run would work for hours, which `Type=oneshot` turns into silently skipped timer firings. `recruitee` forms never reach this queue — its listing carries them, so ingest writes them directly.
- **Nothing holds a flock** — `grep flock` finds none in Go and none in the systemd units. What keeps a cron worker from stacking on itself is systemd: a `Type=oneshot` unit will not start a second instance while the first is active. That protects the TIMER path only, so a run started by hand has no lock at all. **Never stack `reindex-companies` with `make reindex`** — Meilisearch deadlocks, and nothing will stop you. Two workers additionally take a Postgres advisory lock (`cmd/liveness`, `cmd/ghost-crosscheck`); their keys are listed in `internal/migrate`.
- `prune` — the **only** hard-delete path. Dry-run by default; archives every removal to `pruned_jobs`.

## Conventions

- **Response shapes:** Lists: `{"data": ..., "meta": {...}}`; single items: `{"data": ...}`; errors: `{"error": msg}`
- **Dedup key:** `jobs.UNIQUE (source, external_id)` — `UpsertJob` is `ON CONFLICT` on it
- **Auth:** JWT in httpOnly cookie, same-origin, carrying the account's `token_version` so sessions are revocable. `RequireAuth` (cookie only) / `RequireAuthOrKey` (cookie or full-scope Bearer) / `RequireAuthOrScopedKey` (also admits a narrow key)
- **Email ownership:** `users.email_verified`; a password registration starts unverified and is confirmed by a mailed six-digit code. An unverified, password-backed account is **seized** (password cleared, sessions revoked, API keys deleted) when a provider-verified OAuth identity arrives for its address — the account-pre-hijacking defence
- **API keys:** Hashed at rest (SHA-256), scoped `full` or `cv`, and mintable only by an account with a verified address. Key management (create/list/revoke) and password change are cookie-only. A key does not carry the session generation, so a `token_version` bump does not revoke it — that is intentional for sign-out-everywhere and wrong for a takeover, so the seizure and the mailed-code password reset delete the rows in the same statement
- **Enrichment:** Queue-driven (`enrichment_outbox`), provider-agnostic LLM, `Sanitize` + `Validate` gate
- **Embeddings:** Queue-driven (`semantic_outbox`), incremental, reconciled by `reindex --semantic`
- **Dictionaries:** All facet dictionaries are dict-only in production — never guess, emit nothing for unknowns
- **Job deletion:** The lifecycle only soft-closes; `cmd/prune` is the sole hard-delete path
- **In-app assistant:** a bounded tool-calling loop in-process (`internal/assistant`), streamed over SSE, open to every signed-in user. Tools act as the authenticated caller — no credential is minted for an agent
- **LLM spend attribution:** every model call made for a signed-in user goes out on that user's OWN gateway credential (`internal/llmkey` — minted lazily on first use, never shown to them) and carries a `feature:` tag. Work that belongs to nobody — enrichment, Telegram, embeddings — keeps the service credential, and a test enforces that background entrypoints never resolve a user's. Attribution fails open: it can never refuse or fail a call. It measures and does not bound — a turn is still not debited against AI credits
- **Experience provenance:** every banked achievement records whether the CANDIDATE asserted it (`cv_import`/`stated_in_chat`/`manual`) or the MODEL did (`agent_inferred`). Only the former may be written into a CV, and the check lives in the service path, not in a system prompt
- **Sentry:** Opt-in, env-gated, errors-only — `sentry.Init` with `SendDefaultPII:false`
- **Naming — "CV", not "résumé":** Default new surfaces to **CV**. Don't mass-rename the existing `resume`/`resumeextract` packages and columns — churn without value
