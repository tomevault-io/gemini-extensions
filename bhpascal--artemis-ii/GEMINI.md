# CLAUDE.md — Artemis II Explorable Explanation

## What This Is

A Bret Victor-style "explorable explanation" of the orbital mechanics behind NASA's Artemis II free-return lunar trajectory. The mission launched April 1, 2026 and is currently in progress. The page teaches orbital mechanics through interactive visualizations where the reader manipulates parameters and watches trajectories change in real time.

**Inspirations**: Bret Victor's [Ladder of Abstraction](https://worrydream.com/LadderOfAbstraction/), Nicky Case's explorable explanations, Wired's "5 Levels of Difficulty" video series.

**Full project spec**: `docs/project-spec.md` — contains all research data, physics requirements, section designs, and architecture decisions. Read it before starting work.

**Live data sources**: `docs/live-data-sources.md` — API endpoints for real telemetry (community orbit API, AROW, JPL Horizons, mission timeline). Already integrated into Hook section.

**Claude Web visualization reference**: `docs/claude-web-viz` — comprehensive CR3BP analysis including the Arenstorf orbit approach (see "Current Status" below).

**Flyby rewrite spec**: `docs/flyby-rewrite-spec.md` — HISTORICAL. The patched-conic solver was replaced by a CR3BP integrator (`src/physics/cr3bp.ts`). This spec documents the debugging journey but the code it describes no longer exists.

## Current Status (as of 2026-04-08)

**What's working:**
- Sections 1-4 render with CR3BP trajectories
- **Free Return section uses the Arenstorf periodic orbit at real μ = 0.012277471** — perfect closed figure-8, no mass enhancement. Slider controls velocity perturbation (±30 m/s); at 0 it's periodic, at 10 m/s the orbit misses closure by 80% of D_MOON (chaos demo).
- **Real Mission section uses real JPL Horizons ephemeris** for Orion (ID -1024) — actual spacecraft state vectors at 30-minute intervals, transformed into the 2D co-rotating frame. Flyby data matches reality: 413,005 km from Earth, 8,520 km from Moon, 0.42 km/s at T+5d. The Arenstorf orbit still shows as the figure-8 ghost background.
- Live telemetry in Hook section from `artemis.cdnspace.ca/api/orbit` (updates every 60s)
- Countdown to lunar closest approach
- Behind the Scenes page at `/behind-the-scenes`
- Physics test suite: `npm test` runs 22 vitest tests. Run these after any `cr3bp.ts` change.

**Refreshing ephemeris data:**
`npm run fetch-ephemeris` runs `scripts/fetch-ephemeris.ts`, which hits the JPL Horizons API for both Orion (-1024) and Moon (301), parses the Vectors table, transforms into the 2D co-rotating frame, and writes `src/data/orion-trajectory.json`. The JSON is committed to git — builds do not hit Horizons. Re-run manually when fresh data is wanted (e.g., post-splashdown). The pre-Horizons phase (first ~3.4 hours) still uses a synthetic HEO orbit approximation because Horizons has no data before then.

**Architecture note — CR3BP vs real data:**
- `propagateArenstorf(vyPerturbation)` at `MU_REAL` — powers the interactive Free Return section
- `propagate(injectionDv, ...)` at `MU_CR3BP = 0.15` — **no longer used by any section**; retained only for the legacy test script. Can be removed after verifying no other consumers.
- `computeArtemisTrajectory()` in `trajectory.ts` now reads bundled Horizons JSON instead of running a CR3BP integration.

**What's next:**
- **Inertial frame toggle**: Commented out in Free Return — needs CR3BP→inertial coordinate rotation. Transform formulas are in `docs/claude-web-viz`. Now that the orbit itself is clean, this is mostly a coordinate-math task.
- **Behind the Scenes page**: Add the μ enhancement debugging story and the Arenstorf transition to the narrative. Plus now the "real data replaces simulation" story for Section 5.
- **Cleanup**: Delete `MU_CR3BP` and the LEO `propagate()` function once confirmed nothing else depends on them.

## Tech Stack

- **React + TypeScript** — component-based, type-safe
- **Vite** — fast dev server, simple build, static output
- **Modern CSS** — CSS Modules or vanilla CSS, no Tailwind (Tufte typography needs precise control)
- **HTML5 Canvas** — for orbital visualizations (not SVG — too slow for thousands of path points)
- **No heavy dependencies** — no MathJax/KaTeX (hand-crafted HTML math so equation terms can be scrubable), no physics libraries (we write the orbital mechanics)
- **Deploy**: Vercel static site from `dist/`

## Design Philosophy

### Tufte Typography
- ET Book font family (load from CDN: `edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/`)
- ~740px content column, generous right margin for sidenotes
- Sidenotes, not footnotes. On mobile (<760px), sidenotes collapse to toggleable inline elements
- Background: `#fffff8`. Text: `#111`. Links: understated
- Headings use size and spacing, not bold (Tufte convention)
- Math rendered as styled HTML (`<var>`, `<sup>`, flex-based fractions), not images or library output

### Interactive Elements
- **Scrubable numbers**: Inline numbers the reader can click-drag to change. They update linked visualizations in real time. Inspired by Bret Victor's Tangle library. Use pointer events (not separate mouse/touch). Visually: subtle dotted underline, cursor: col-resize, color accent
- **Canvas visualizations**: Embedded in the narrative flow, wider than the text column (spanning into sidenote margin). Each section has its own canvas with its own controller
- **Sliders**: For large-range parameters (e.g., mission time scrubber). Bidirectionally linked with any corresponding scrubable numbers
- **Progressive narrative**: Concepts build on each other. Scroll-driven — IntersectionObserver activates/deactivates canvas renderers for performance

### The 5-Level Explanation System

A floating panel lets the reader switch explanation level in real time. **The interactive visualizations are identical at every level** — only the prose and equations change. This is the core design constraint.

| Level | Label | Audience | Math Available |
|-------|-------|----------|----------------|
| 1 | Curious Kid | ~8 years old | No math. Pure metaphor. "Throw a ball so fast it misses the ground" |
| 2 | Middle School | ~12 years old | Arithmetic, basic algebra. Speed = distance/time. Proportional reasoning |
| 3 | High School Physics | ~17 years old | Trig, vectors, F = GMm/r^2. Newton's laws. **This is the default level** |
| 4 | Undergrad Physics | College + physics courses | Calculus, conservation laws, vis-viva equation. Can follow derivations |
| 5 | B.S. Physics | Physics degree holder | Has the full toolkit. Sonar pings into deeper topics (Lagrangian mechanics, restricted 3-body problem, Jacobi constants) — map the rabbit holes without full analysis |

**Implementation**: All 5 text variants live in the DOM simultaneously. CSS controls visibility (`display: none` + opacity transition). A `LevelManager` responds to button clicks and dispatches a `levelchange` CustomEvent. Section controllers listen and adjust canvas annotations accordingly.

**The floating panel**: Fixed position, right side, vertically centered. Vertical stack of buttons with active level highlighted. On mobile, collapses to bottom sheet or dropdown.

### Data Flow
Unidirectional, event-driven:
```
User Input (scrub/slider) → Parameter State (useState) → Physics Recomputation → Canvas Render
```
Each section owns its own state. Sections are independent — changing a parameter in one does not affect another. The level system is the only cross-cutting concern (React context).

### Performance
- Only render canvases that are in the viewport (IntersectionObserver)
- Physics computations are pure functions — fast, no allocation churn
- Use `requestAnimationFrame` for animations, not setInterval
- Pre-compute the Artemis II trajectory once at load time (~50ms)

## Physics Implementation Notes

The physics must be **real orbital mechanics**, not hand-waved approximations. The spec has full details, but the key algorithms:

1. **Vis-viva equation**: `v^2 = mu * (2/r - 1/a)` — the fundamental relationship
2. **Kepler equation solver**: Newton-Raphson iteration for eccentric anomaly from mean anomaly
3. **Patched conic approximation**: Three segments (Earth ellipse → Moon hyperbola → Earth return ellipse), velocity/position "patched" at SOI boundaries
4. **Hyperbolic flyby**: Turn angle from `delta = 2 * arcsin(1/e)` where eccentricity comes from approach velocity and periapsis distance

### Verification
Embed a test mode (`?test=1` URL parameter) that validates:
- Circular velocity at 200km LEO = ~7,784 m/s
- Escape velocity at 200km = ~11,009 m/s
- Kepler solver convergence for known cases
- Conservation of energy/angular momentum within each conic segment
- Artemis II trajectory matches known mission parameters (max distance, flyby altitude, duration)

## Writing Standards

The prose is as important as the code. This is an essay with embedded interactives, not a tech demo with captions.

- Each section tells a story. The interactive is the argument, not an illustration
- At Level 1: short sentences, wonder and excitement, concrete metaphors
- At Level 3 (default): clear technical writing, equations introduced with motivation
- At Level 5: assume competence, point toward deeper structure, name the theorems
- Sidenotes for tangents, historical notes, "fun facts"
- The Artemis II mission is happening RIGHT NOW — use present tense, create urgency

## Commit Conventions

- `feat:` new sections, interactives, components
- `fix:` physics bugs, rendering issues
- `style:` typography, layout, CSS
- `docs:` README, comments
- `refactor:` code restructuring
- `perf:` rendering optimizations

## Don't

- Don't add a build framework heavier than Vite
- Don't use MathJax or KaTeX (need scrubable terms inside equations)
- Don't use a CSS framework (Tufte typography needs precise manual control)
- Don't fake the physics — every trajectory must come from real equations
- Don't make the level switcher feel like a settings panel. It should feel like a reading mode — effortless, delightful
- Don't neglect mobile. Sidenotes collapse, canvases resize, level switcher adapts
