## Quick Start

**First time setup?** → Run `bash setup.sh` then `bash verify_environment.sh` (see [ENVIRONMENT_QUICK_START.md](ENVIRONMENT_QUICK_START.md))
**New project?** → Say "brainstorm" or "help me find a topic" (see [ma-topic-intake](ma-topic-intake/SKILL.md))
**Have TOPIC.txt?** → Say "start" or "continue" (see [ma-end-to-end](ma-end-to-end/SKILL.md))
**At Stage 06?** → Say "complete manuscript" (see [ma-manuscript-quarto](ma-manuscript-quarto/SKILL.md))
**Want to see an example?** → Check `projects/ici-breast-cancer/` (99% complete meta-analysis)
**Want to validate the workflow?** → See [metadat Validation](ma-end-to-end/references/metadat-validation.md)

**Key Metrics**:

- 5 RCTs, N=2,402 patients
- Primary outcome: RR 1.26 (95% CI 1.16-1.37), p=0.0015, ⊕⊕⊕⊕ HIGH quality
- Manuscript: 4,921 words (compliant with Lancet Oncology, JAMA Oncology)
- Time invested: ~14 hours (vs 100+ hours manual)

**Quick Tour**:

1. `projects/ici-breast-cancer/README.md` - Complete navigation guide
2. `projects/ici-breast-cancer/00_overview/FINAL_PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` - All findings (415 lines)
3. `projects/ici-breast-cancer/07_manuscript/` - Full manuscript (5 sections + 7 tables)
4. `projects/ici-breast-cancer/06_analysis/` - All R scripts + results

**Use this as a template** when starting your own meta-analysis.

## Agent Teams (Experimental)

Coordinate multiple Claude Code instances for parallel meta-analysis pipeline work.

### Quick Commands

- "Create a team for project X" → Full pipeline team (all stages)
- "Parallel screen project X" → Dual-review screening team only
- "Analysis team for project X" → Statistician + manuscript writer + QA auditor

### How It Works

- Lead reads `/ma-agent-teams` skill for orchestration playbook
- Teammates spawned with role-specific prompts from `ma-agent-teams/prompts/`
- Shared task list tracks dependencies; hooks enforce quality gates
- Each teammate owns specific directories (no cross-teammate file writes)

### Generate Spawn Prompts

```bash
uv run tooling/python/team_spawn_helper.py --project <project-name> --role <role> [--list]
```

### Prerequisites

- Claude Code v2.1.32+
- Enabled via `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1` in `.claude/settings.local.json`

### Team Roles

| Role                    | Stages | File Ownership              |
| ----------------------- | ------ | --------------------------- |
| protocol-architect      | 00-01  | `01_protocol/**`            |
| search-specialist       | 02     | `02_search/**`              |
| screener-a / screener-b | 03     | `03_screening/**`           |
| fulltext-manager        | 04     | `04_fulltext/**`            |
| data-extractor          | 05     | `05_extraction/**`          |
| statistician            | 06     | `06_analysis/**`            |
| manuscript-writer       | 07     | `07_manuscript/**`          |
| qa-auditor              | 08-09  | `08_reviews/**`, `09_qa/**` |

## When User Says "Start" or "See TOPIC.txt"

⚠️ **MANDATORY FIRST STEP**: Run 4-hour feasibility assessment ([Feasibility Checklist](ma-topic-intake/references/feasibility-checklist.md)) before any data extraction or protocol writing.

**Why**: Prevents 10-40 hours of wasted work on unanswerable research questions.

Then proceed:

1. **Ask for project name** if not already specified
2. **Read `projects/<project-name>/TOPIC.txt`** to understand the research question
3. **Check project state** - which stages are complete in `projects/<project-name>/`?
4. **Ask only essential questions** before proceeding:
   - Databases to search — **PubMed + Scopus are mandatory minimum** (PRISMA requires ≥2 databases); optionally add Embase, Cochrane
   - Date range limits?
   - Language restrictions?
   - Study design (RCTs only, or include observational?)
5. **Preliminary analysis type** (two-stage decision — confirmed after screening):
   - If TOPIC.txt describes ≥3 treatments → `analysis_type.preliminary: nma_candidate` (provisional)
   - If TOPIC.txt describes 2 treatments → `analysis_type.preliminary: pairwise`
   - Copy `analysis-type-decision-template.md` → `01_protocol/analysis-type-decision.md`, fill Stage 1
   - **`nma_candidate` requires confirmation after screening** (see Step 3b in end-to-end)
6. **Initialize project** if not done:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/htlin/meta-pipe
   uv run tooling/python/init_project.py --name <project-name>
   ```
7. **Execute pipeline stages** in order, validating at each step

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: All project data is in `projects/<project-name>/`. All commands are in module-specific `SKILL.md` files.

---

## When User Says "Continue" or "Status"

See [ma-end-to-end/SKILL.md](ma-end-to-end/SKILL.md) for detailed resume behavior.

**Quick summary**:

```bash
cd /Users/htlin/meta-pipe/tooling/python

# 1. Check project status
uv run project_status.py --project <project-name> --verbose

# 2. Show last session summary
uv run session_log.py --project <project-name> resume

# 3. Check for NEXT_STEPS file
ls -t projects/<project-name>/NEXT_STEPS_*.md | head -1
```

Then provide personalized report with next actions.

---

## When User Says "Complete Manuscript" or "Prepare for Submission"

See [ma-manuscript-quarto/SKILL.md](ma-manuscript-quarto/SKILL.md) for detailed workflow.

**Phase 1 (MANDATORY)**: Fill `manuscript_outline.md` and get user approval before writing any sections.

**Phase 2**: Use the **meta-manuscript-assembly** skill (6-8 hours to 90% publication-ready manuscript)

**Phase 3 (QUALITY REFINEMENT)** ⚠️ **DO NOT SKIP** - See [ma-submission-prep/SKILL.md](ma-submission-prep/SKILL.md)

- Transforms 90% → 95-98% readiness (+10% acceptance rate)
- 5 Required Items (Total: 2-3 hours)
- ROI: Prevents 6-12 months revision delay

---

## Rules

- **Environment**:
  - First-time setup: `bash setup.sh` (30-60 min, one-time)
  - Verify anytime: `bash verify_environment.sh` (2 min)
  - See [ENVIRONMENT_QUICK_START.md](ENVIRONMENT_QUICK_START.md) for details
- **Python**: Always `uv run`, never `python3` directly
- **Dependencies**:
  - Python: `uv add <package>` in `tooling/python/`
  - R: `install.packages()` then `renv::snapshot()` in project root
- **API keys**: Read from `.env` ([ma-search-bibliography/references/api-setup.md](ma-search-bibliography/references/api-setup.md))
- **Rounds**: Keep all `round-XX` data, never overwrite
- **Delete**: Use `rip` not `rm`

---

## Decision Points (Ask User)

Only ask if information is missing from TOPIC.txt:

- Target population, intervention, comparator, outcomes (PICO)
- **Analysis type (pairwise vs network)**: preliminary by treatment count (≥3 → `nma_candidate`), confirmed after screening with transitivity assessment
- Additional databases beyond PubMed + Scopus (mandatory minimum): Embase? Cochrane?
- Risk-of-bias tool (RoB 2 vs ROBINS-I)
- Effect measure (RR/OR/HR/SMD/MD)
- Subgroup variables
