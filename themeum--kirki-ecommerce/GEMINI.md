# Project Instructions for Claude

This file is based on `.cursor/rules/` but the PHP and React sections have
been re-derived from the actual codebase (not just copied from the `.mdc`
files), so they reflect real conventions rather than stale ones — e.g. the
frontend moved from `.jsx` to TypeScript, and the PHP `@since`/`final` rules
didn't match what the code actually does. Section 1 (behavioral guidelines)
is a direct mirror of `karpathy-guidelines.mdc`. If the codebase's conventions
change, re-derive rather than trusting `.cursor/rules/` at face value.

---

## 0. Testing / Verification

Do not use the Browser tool (or any dev-server preview) to test or verify
changes in this project. Skip the browser-based verification workflow
entirely — rely on typecheck (`npm run typecheck`), lint, and the test suite
(`npm test` in `resources/app/`) instead. If a change genuinely needs visual
confirmation, say so and let the user check it themselves rather than
opening a browser preview.

---

## 1. Behavioral Guidelines (always apply)

Source: `.cursor/rules/karpathy-guidelines.mdc`

Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes.

**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

### Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:

- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them — don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

### Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

### Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:

- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it — don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:

- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

### Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:

- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:

```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

**These guidelines are working if:** fewer unnecessary changes in diffs, fewer rewrites due to overcomplication, and clarifying questions come before implementation rather than after mistakes.

---

## 1a. Planning Workflow

When entering plan mode in this project, always use the **OpenSpec workflow**
instead of writing a freeform plan. Reach for the `openspec-*` / `opsx:*`
skills:

- `opsx:explore` — think through the problem before committing to a change
- `opsx:propose` — generate a full proposal (spec deltas, design, tasks)
- `opsx:apply` — implement tasks from an existing change
- `opsx:sync` — sync delta specs into main specs
- `opsx:archive` — finalize and archive a completed change

Before implementing tasks from an existing change always ask me to run the command `opsx:apply` manually
by myself instead of applying automatically.

Note: Whenever I start a new session make sure to follow the **OpenSpec workflow** by default.

---

## 2. PHP Coding Standards

Derived from analyzing the actual code in `app/` and `database/` (404 PHP files).
Applies to: `app/**/*.php`, `database/**/*.php`.

**Do not use `vendor/libraries/framework/src/` as a style reference, and do not
hand-edit it.** It is the `themeum/framework` package, relocated there from
`vendor/themeum/framework` and namespace-rewritten by the `composer scope`
script (`php-scoper` stages the prefixed output, then `bin/scope-framework.php`
swaps it in). Any edit is lost on the next `composer install`. Its conventions
belong to the upstream package, not this project.

Target PHP **7.4** (see `composer.json` `config.platform.php`). Follow PSR-4 file naming.

### WordPress.org Plugin Directory Requirements

This plugin targets wordpress.org submission. Apply the required-for-approval
subset of WordPress coding standards (escaping, sanitization/unslashing,
nonces, i18n, ABSPATH guards, WP-version compatibility, no global PHP state
mutation) to every PHP change, in every session — not just when a task is
explicitly about submission readiness. This is narrower than full
`WordPress-Extra`/`WordPress-Docs` style compliance, which is out of scope.

Enforced by `composer phpcs:wporg` (`phpcs-wporg.xml.dist`, also in CI) —
run it, read its inline comments for the specifics and known false-positive
exceptions, and prefer `Kirki\Ecommerce\Framework\Sanitizer::apply_rule()`
over calling WP sanitize functions directly to match this codebase's
convention.

Never read `$_GET`/`$_POST`/`$_SERVER`/`$_COOKIE`/`$_FILES` directly. Use:

- `Kirki\Ecommerce\Framework\Http\Request` (via the `request()` helper) for
  single-key reads in code that only ever runs inside a dispatched site or
  REST request — it merges query, POST, and route params into one typed
  accessor (`->int()`, `->text()`, `->array()`, `->cookie()`, ...), already
  used in `CartService.php` and `resources/views/site/login.php`.
- `Kirki\Ecommerce\Framework\Http\Superglobals` everywhere else: whole-array
  reads where the exact source array matters (not `Request`'s merged
  `all()`), method-scoped or otherwise security-sensitive reads (e.g. a
  nonce check that must not blur `$_GET`/`$_POST`), and any code with no
  guaranteed request lifecycle (wp-admin hooks, raw `wp_ajax_*` endpoints,
  cross-cutting managers).

Both unslash and sanitize via `Sanitizer` internally — never wrap their
output in another `wp_unslash()`/`sanitize_*()` call.

### Classes and Files

- Class names: **PascalCase** (`CartService`, `PaymentManager`)
- File names: PSR-4 — one class per file, filename matches class name
- Namespace must match the PSR-4 autoload map in `composer.json`
  (`Kirki\Ecommerce\App\` → `app/`, `Kirki\Ecommerce\Database\...` → `database/...`)
- Interfaces live in a `Contracts/` sub-namespace (e.g. `App\Contracts`, `App\Scheduler\Contracts`)
- Traits live in a `Concerns/` sub-namespace (e.g. `App\Concerns`, `App\Scheduler\Concerns`)
- Don't declare classes `final`, with one exception: classes that only hold
  public constants and are never instantiated (e.g. `App\Constants\*`,
  `App\Constants\Order\OrderStatus`) — those may be `final`

### Methods, Properties, and Variables

- Methods and variables: **snake_case** (`get_cart`, `$customer_id`) — this is
  followed almost universally in this codebase. The only exceptions are
  methods required by a native PHP interface (`IteratorAggregate::getIterator`,
  `JsonSerializable::jsonSerialize`, `ArrayAccess::offsetGet`, etc.) — keep
  those camelCase since PHP mandates the exact method name.
- Names must be meaningful and express intent; avoid `$a`, `$b`, `$temp`
- Visibility: **`private` is never used in this codebase** — use `protected`
  or `public` instead.
  - `public` — API surface (controllers, facades, hooks called externally)
  - `protected` — default for internal members; use for anything not part
    of the public API
- Static references: always use `static::`, never `self::`

```php
// ❌ BAD
private $repository;
self::PAGINATION_LIMIT;

// ✅ GOOD
protected $repository;
static::PAGINATION_LIMIT;
```

### Arrays and Syntax

- Use short array syntax `[]`, never `array()` — 100% consistent in this codebase
- Prefer self-explanatory naming and structure over comments
- Inline `//` comments do appear, but sparingly — mainly for section dividers
  in long DTOs, `// phpcs:ignore ... -- reason` directives, and genuinely
  non-obvious context. Don't add comments that just restate what the code does.

### Type Hints and Return Types

Type hints and return types are used, but **not** on every method — treat
them as encouraged for new code, not mandatory, and match whatever the
surrounding class already does. When you do add them, PHP 7.4 syntax only
(no union types, no constructor property promotion, no enums — those are PHP 8+).

### Docblocks

Every class, interface, trait, method, function and property in `app/` and
`database/` has a docblock, whatever its visibility. Class constants and
closures don't need one. Spec: `openspec/changes/standardize-php-docblocks/`.

- One-line summary: imperative for methods/functions ("Get all online
  gateways."), descriptive for classes. Add a description paragraph only when
  behavior isn't obvious from the summary and signature.
- Order: summary, blank line, `@since`, blank line, `@param`, `@return`, `@throws`
- `@since` on every class, interface, trait, method and function. Declarations
  that predate this standard use `@since 1.0.0`; new ones use the version they ship in
- `@param` for each parameter in signature order, aligned per PHPCS conventions
- `@return` always, except on constructors/destructors (use `@return void` when the method returns nothing)
- `@throws` only when the method itself throws (including via `throw_if()`/`throw_anyway()`)
- Properties get `@var` only, no `@since`; single-line `/** @var Type */` is fine
- Overrides and interface implementations use `@inheritDoc` plus `@since`,
  unless the contract changes
- Types: `Type[]` for lists, `array<string, mixed>` for maps, `Type|null` for
  nullables, `mixed` when the type can't be established — never guess
- Docblocks are documentation only: don't turn them into native type
  declarations as part of documenting

```php
/**
 * Manages the registered payment gateways.
 *
 * @since 1.0.0
 */
class PaymentManager
{
    /**
     * Get all online gateways.
     *
     * @since 1.0.0
     *
     * @return PaymentGateway[]
     */
    public function get_all_online_gateways()
    {
        return collection($this->gateways_registry)
            ->reject(fn($gateway) => $gateway->is_manual())
            ->all();
    }

    /** @var array<string, PaymentGateway> */
    protected $gateways_registry = [];
}
```

### Money and Pricing Fields

Any DB column, model attribute, DTO property, request field, or resource
output key that holds a monetary amount must be qualified — never a bare
`price`, `amount`, `total`, `cost`, `fee`, or `subtotal`. Which prefix depends
on what currency the value is actually in:

- **`base_*`** — the amount in the store's base currency. This is the only
  form ever persisted to the database for catalog/cart/coupon money (e.g.
  `variants.base_price`, `variants.base_sale_price`, `coupons.base_discount_amount_fixed`).
- **`display_*`** — the same amount converted to the visitor's requested
  currency (`Money::resolve_display_currency()`), computed on the fly in the
  Resource layer. **Never stored** — there is no `display_*` column, only
  `display_*` keys in API responses.
- **`invoiced_*`** — a historical snapshot in the order's transaction
  currency at the time the order was placed (orders, order items, refunds,
  `orders.invoiced_payment_gateway_fee`). On `orders`/`order_items` every
  `invoiced_*` field has a `base_*` sibling captured at the same time; on
  `refunds` there is currently no `base_*` counterpart (refunds aren't
  currency-converted), so `invoiced_*` stands alone there.

Every `base_*`/`invoiced_*`/`display_*` money field in a Resource must ship
with a matching `*_money_object` key built via `Money::prepare_amount_object_from_minor()`
(a `MoneyDTO`: `raw` float, `display` formatted string, `currency` `{code, symbol}`).
`Money::prepare_amount_from_minor()` gives you the plain float for the bare key.

```php
'base_price' => Money::prepare_amount_from_minor($this->base_price),
'base_price_money_object' => Money::prepare_amount_object_from_minor($this->base_price),
'display_price' => Money::prepare_amount_from_minor($this->base_price, null, $display_currency),
'display_price_money_object' => Money::prepare_amount_object_from_minor($this->base_price, null, $display_currency),
```

Because DTO/request field names normally mirror DB columns 1:1, this
prefixing has to be threaded through the full round trip — migration column,
model `$fillable`/`$casts`, DTO property, request validation rule/sanitizer
key, and the Resource read — not just the API response. See `Variant`/`Coupon`
(migrations, models, DTOs) and `VariantResource`/`CouponResource` (output) for
the reference implementation.

**Not every "amount-shaped" field needs a prefix** — only ones that are
unambiguously a currency amount. Leave bare: percentages (`discount_amount_percentage`),
rates (`tax_rate`), quantities/counts (`available_quantity`, `spend_condition_value`),
and units of measure (`total_unit_amount`, `base_unit_amount` — a weight/volume
unit, not money, despite the `base_` in the name).

If a field's currency is ambiguous by design — e.g. `Coupon`'s `discount_amount`
request field, which is a fixed currency amount _or_ a percentage depending on
`discount_value_type` — leave it unprefixed rather than picking a misleading
prefix; the repository layer resolves it to the correct typed column
(`base_discount_amount_fixed` vs. `discount_amount_percentage`).

### General

- Match existing project patterns when editing surrounding code
- Prefer early returns for readability
- Follow the WordPress.org Plugin Directory Requirements above for escaping, sanitization, nonces, and i18n

## 3. React / TypeScript Coding Standards

Derived from analyzing the actual code in `resources/app/`.
Applies to: `resources/app/**/*.{ts,tsx}`.

**Note:** the old `.cursor/rules/react-standards.mdc` targets `**/*.jsx`, but
this codebase has fully migrated to TypeScript — there are zero `.jsx` files
left (351 `.tsx`, 192 `.ts`). Write all new frontend code in `.ts`/`.tsx`.

### App Structure

Top-level folders under `resources/app/` and what belongs in each — put new
code where its peers already live rather than inventing a new top-level folder:

- `pages/` — route-level feature modules, one folder per feature
  (`pages/brands/`, `pages/orders/`). Feature-specific subcomponents go in a
  nested folder (`pages/brands/brand-table/single-row.tsx`), not in `components/`.
- `components/` — shared/reusable UI, not tied to one page.
  `components/ui/` holds design-system primitives (`button.tsx`, `dialog.tsx`,
  `checkbox.tsx`, ...); other subfolders group a specific shared widget
  (`components/data-table/`, `components/modal/`).
- `services/` — one file per API resource (`services/product.ts`,
  `services/customer.ts`), wrapping `axios` calls, consumed via
  `@tanstack/react-query`.
- `schemas/` — `zod` schemas, split by purpose: `schemas/forms/` (form
  validation, see below), `schemas/catalog/`, `schemas/shared/`, `schemas/reference/`.
- `hooks/` — reusable hooks, one per file.
- `contexts/` — React context providers.
- `theme/` — design tokens and the `@emotion/react` styling helpers (see Styling below).
- `types/` — shared TypeScript types, re-exported from `types/index.ts`.
- `utils/` — small, pure helper functions.
- `libs/` — thin wrappers around third-party libraries (e.g. `libs/zod`).

### Files and Folders

- Folders and files: **lowercase**, words separated by **dashes**
  (`brand-table/`, `confirmation-dialog.tsx`, `use-debounce.ts`)
- Don't create a barrel `index.ts` per component. The only barrels in this
  codebase aggregate a whole domain (`types/index.ts`, `hooks/index.ts`,
  `theme/index.ts`, `components/data-table/index.ts`) — reserve that pattern
  for a similarly cohesive module, not a single component.
- Hook filenames should be `use-thing.ts` (kebab-case), matching `use-debounce.ts`
  and `use-list-params.ts`. `useBulkEditList.ts` / `useMarkList.ts` are legacy
  camelCase leftovers — don't add new files in that style.
- Co-locate tests next to the file they cover: `brand-form.ts` + `brand-form.test.ts`
  (Vitest — run via `npm test` in `resources/app/`).

### Components

- Component names: **PascalCase** (`ConfirmationDialog`, `DataTable`)
- Define as arrow functions, `displayName` set explicitly, default export at the bottom:

```tsx
const ConfirmationDialog = (props: ConfirmationDialogProps) => {
  // ...
  return <Dialog>...</Dialog>;
};

ConfirmationDialog.displayName = "ConfirmationDialog";

export default ConfirmationDialog;
```

- Props typed with a `type Xxx = { ... }` declared above the component
  (not `interface`), named `<ComponentName>Props`.
- `forwardRef` / `memo`: assign `displayName` on the wrapped const, same as above.

### Control Flow

Never use inline returns for conditional statements — always wrap the body in braces (followed with zero exceptions in this codebase):

```tsx
// ❌ BAD
if (condition) return true;

// ✅ GOOD
if (condition) {
  return true;
}
```

### Strings and i18n

- JavaScript/TypeScript strings: single quotes `'value'` or backticks for template literals — never double quotes
- JSX prop string values: double quotes (`variant="primary"`, `size="large"`)
- User-facing static text: use `__()` from `@/wpi18n` with domain `kirki-ecommerce`

```tsx
import { __ } from "@/wpi18n";

<Button text={__("Save changes", "kirki-ecommerce")} variant="primary" />;
```

### Imports

Group imports in this order, separated by blank lines:

1. External packages (`react`, `react-router`, `lucide-react`, etc.)
2. Internal `@/` aliases (`@/components/ui/button`, `@/theme`, `@/wpi18n`, etc.)
3. Relative imports (`./confirmation-dialog.scss`)

Always use the `@/` alias for internal paths — avoid deep relative imports when an alias exists.
Use `import type { ... }` for type-only imports.

```tsx
import { Info } from "lucide-react";
import type { ReactNode } from "react";

import Button from "@/components/ui/button";
import { theme } from "@/theme";
import { __ } from "@/wpi18n";

import "./confirmation-dialog.scss";
```

### Styling

Styling goes through `@emotion/react`, not plain CSS modules or inline
`style` for anything non-dynamic:

- Define styles with `defineStyles({...})` from `@/theme/mixins`, keyed by element role
- Reference design tokens from `theme` (`@/theme`) — colors, spacing,
  radius, typography — instead of hardcoded values
- Make sure the applied design does not cause any layout shifting to the interface.
- Apply with the `css` prop (`scoped(styles.icon)` for scoped styles), and
  reserve the `style` prop for truly dynamic, runtime-computed values

```tsx
const styles = defineStyles({
  title: {
    ...theme.typography.heading4(),
    textAlign: "center",
  },
});
```

### Forms and Validation

Form schemas live in `schemas/forms/<name>-form.ts` and follow one consistent
shape (see `schemas/forms/brand-form.ts`):

```ts
const XxxFormShape = z.object({
  /* fields, using helpers from @/libs/zod */
});

const XxxFormSchema = prepareFormSchema(XxxFormShape).transform((values) => ({
  /* map to the payload shape the API expects */
}));

type XxxFormInput = z.input<typeof XxxFormSchema>;
type XxxFormPayload = z.output<typeof XxxFormSchema>;

export { XxxFormSchema, type XxxFormInput, type XxxFormPayload };
```

Use `react-hook-form` with `@hookform/resolvers` to wire the schema to the form.

### Data Fetching

- API calls go in `services/<resource>.ts`, built on `axios`
- Components consume them through `@tanstack/react-query` (`useQuery`/`useMutation`), not ad-hoc `useEffect` + `useState` fetching

### Comments

Do not add comments to describe code. Use meaningful variable and function names so the code reads clearly on its own.

## 6. Documentation

User-facing features get a `docs/<feature>.md`, structured like
[`docs/cache.md`](docs/cache.md): a table of contents, then numbered `## N. Topic`
sections, quick start first, configuration and drivers in the middle, and — for
anything modelled on a Laravel API — a **"Where this differs from Laravel"**
section near the end that is honest about the gaps. That section is not
optional; it is what stops a consumer assuming parity we don't have.

Keep docs in the same change as the code. A doc that describes the old
behaviour is worse than no doc.

---

## 7. Commits

Don't commit or push unless I ask. When I do ask commit the changes with a inferred
commit message that is good enough for PR title and description and also push on behalf of me.

## 8. Grilling behavior

When using the /grill-me skill ask me questions one by one and use the graphical interface
so that I can select my answer graphically. Always mention your recommendation while questioning.
