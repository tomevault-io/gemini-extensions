# TalkWithMe — Agent Instructions

## Run the app

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
deactivate
```

Requires a locally running **llama.cpp** server with an OpenAI-compatible API (or any OpenAI-compatible LLM, local or remote). TTS and STT servers are optional.
Open `http://localhost:8000` in a browser.

A remote LLM that needs an API key is supported: set the `TALKWITHME_LLM_API_KEY` env var or create an `llm_api_key` file in the project root (copy `llm_api_key.example`) — see the README "LLM API key (remote LLMs)" section. The key is never in `settings.yaml`, never in the UI, and never logged.

## Testing — pytest, fully offline

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
python -m pytest # config in pytest.ini
deactivate
```

- **No servers needed.** The suite is hermetic: every external HTTP endpoint (LLM, TTS, STT, MCP) is faked via `tests/factories.py` (fake `httpx.AsyncClient`s, config factories, SSE helpers). It must run — and pass — with nothing but Python installed.
- **Isolation**: `tests/conftest.py` has an autouse fixture that points every module-level global at per-test `tmp_path` state: the config caches in `app/config.py`, `_PERSISTENCE_ROOT` (in both `app/persistence.py` and `app/routers/persistence.py` — the router imported it *by value*, so it needs its own patch), the `session` singleton, the MCP tool registry, the TTS capabilities cache in `app/services/tts_client.py`, the LLM API key cache in `app/services/llm_auth.py` (its `_PROJECT_ROOT` is re-pointed to `tmp_path` and `TALKWITHME_LLM_API_KEY` is deleted from the environment, so a test's key — or the developer's real one — never leaks into another test), and the once-per-URL cleartext-warning dedupe set in `app/services/llm.py`. Real `settings.yaml` / `Personas/` / `chatrooms.yaml` / `chatrooms/` / `llm_api_key` data is never read or written. **If you add a new module-level global to the app, add it to that fixture.**
- **Lifespan**: the `client` fixture uses `TestClient` *without* the startup lifespan, because the lifespan re-reads the real YAML files (clobbering test caches) and attempts MCP discovery. Tests that exercise the lifespan do so explicitly with a local `TestClient` in a `with` block and monkeypatched `load_*`/`load_tools` (see `tests/test_main.py`).
- **Coverage map**: `test_config.py` (config models + YAML load/save), `test_persona_store.py` (persona directory discovery: frontmatter, file ops, language/avatar helpers, memory-file append/purge, YAML→dir migration), `test_builtin.py` (the built-in `add_memory` tool: registry, availability gating, save/error paths), `test_models.py` (API request/response models), `test_persistence.py` (disk persistence + audio staging), `test_session_manager.py`, `test_llm.py` (SSE parsing + agentic tool loop + the LLM API key header + the `http://` cleartext warning), `test_llm_auth.py` (LLM API key resolution: env-var/file priority, the `llm_api_key = <value>` file format, lazy load, the never-logged invariant), `test_mcp_client.py`, `test_tool_registry.py`, `test_tts_stt_clients.py`, `test_tts_fixtures.py` (the two copies of the four capabilities snapshots — pytest's `tests/factories.py` vs the plain-Node `tests/fixtures/*.json` — must not drift; re-copy both from tts-serve in the same commit), `test_chat_sse.py` (the `/api/chat` SSE endpoint — LLM stubbed, selection/persistence/echo/tool events for real), `test_main.py`, `test_docs.py` (the AGENTS.md API endpoints table must match the routes actually registered on the app — run it after adding/removing endpoints and update the table), one `test_routers_*.py` per API router, `test_persona_form.js` (plain Node, **not** part of pytest — see below: the persona editor form logic in `static/persona.js`), and `test_tts_settings.js` (plain Node, **not** part of pytest: the dynamic TTS parameter section in `static/tts-params.js` + the TTS wiring in `static/settings.js`).
- **Frontend tests (Node)**: `tests/test_persona_form.js` runs with plain Node 20+ — no npm packages, no network: `node tests/test_persona_form.js`. It evaluates the real `static/utils.js` + `state.js` + `persona.js` in a fresh `vm.Context` per test against a minimal DOM stub, stubs `fetch` to capture the multipart `FormData`, and drives the real `openPersonaForm()`, Remove-button listeners, file-input change handlers, and `submitPersonaForm()`. It exists to lock in the invariants that `remove_avatar_image` / `remove_reference_audio` are sent **only** after an explicit "Remove" click — never derived from server-side file presence (that bug silently deleted a persona's avatar and reference audio on every plain text save) — and, by the same rule, that `clear_memories` is sent only after an explicit "Clear saved memories" click while `memory_size` is **always** sent (the update endpoint requires it; an omitted value must not silently reset the persona's memory budget). `tests/test_tts_settings.js` uses the same harness (fresh `vm.Context` per test, minimal DOM stub, stubbed `fetch`) but loads `static/utils.js` + `state.js` + `tts-params.js` + `settings.js` and drives the real `openSettings()`, the TTS enabled/Base-URL change listeners, and form submission against the real tts-serve capabilities snapshots in `tests/fixtures/`. It locks in the T9 widget table (incl. "null default ⇒ not a slider" and the integer-span rule), the app-managed-fields exclusion (`text`/`audio_base64`/`reference_text`/`language` are never rendered), the "blank = let the engine decide" collection semantics (blank optionals omitted; checkboxes/sliders/selects-with-default always sent), the `array` parameter widget (flat scalar item lists, tts-serve schema v2: a fixed item count renders one labeled row per item — the engine's `item_labels[i]` when the spec advertises a well-formed list (exactly one non-empty string per item), else the `name[i]` fallback, which mirrors the validators' item naming; malformed labels degrade to the fallback and never to the JSON hatch — all-blank omits the parameter, a partially filled one is a validation error and blank slots are never filled with invented values; variable-size or malformed array specs fall to the raw-JSON escape hatch — tested with synthetic docs since no shipped snapshot has an array param yet), the T10 version gate, and the pass-through rule that a save with no capabilities document sends the saved `tts.parameters` unchanged rather than `{}` (never silently wipe). It also locks in the reconnect feature (Refresh button + Base-URL change listener probe the field's url via `?base_url=`; a scheme-less url gets the specific 422 line, not "not reachable"; a same-URL refetch keeps in-flight slider edits instead of re-filling from saved values, and only a real engine switch shows the "edits discarded" note), and — critically — the DOM stub's `children` are array-like **non-Array** lists (HTMLCollection mimic), so the suite catches the regression class where code gates on `Array.isArray(element.children)`: in real browsers that silently collects zero parameter values on every save, wiping `tts.parameters` (the save→reopen round-trip test reproduces the user-visible symptom: values reverting to the engine's doc defaults). Both files are kept out of the pytest suite on purpose: pytest must stay runnable with nothing but Python installed.
- **Two expected deprecation warnings**: a clean run is "all tests pass", even when the `warnings summary` contains exactly two third-party deprecation warnings. Both come from Starlette 1.x's own testclient (pulled in via the `fastapi.testclient` import), not from app or test code: a `StarletteDeprecationWarning` that the httpx-based testclient will one day be replaced by a new `httpx2` package, and an `anyio.abc.BlockingPortal` alias deprecation raised from inside `starlette/testclient.py`. Neither is harmful today — the testclient works fine on httpx as of Starlette 1.6 — so don't chase them and don't "fix" app/test code in response. The eventual resolution, if it ever comes, is a future Starlette/httpx2 bump, not a code change here.
- **Rules**:
  - Every code change must be followed by a clean run: `.venv/bin/python -m pytest`, all green. No exceptions, no skipped tests. Changes to `static/persona.js` (or anything else covered by the Node tests) additionally require `node tests/test_persona_form.js` all green; changes touching the dynamic TTS section (`static/tts-params.js`, the TTS wiring in `static/settings.js`, or the capabilities fixtures) additionally require `node tests/test_tts_settings.js` all green.
  - New functionality or API endpoints require new tests in the matching `test_*.py` file before the change is complete.
  - API tests use the `client` fixture + config caches (re-point `app.config._settings_cache` / `_personas_cache` / `_chatrooms_cache` via `monkeypatch`); router-level stubs are applied at the router's import site (e.g. `app.routers.chat.stream_chat`), since routers import service functions by name.
  - All fake responses in `tests/factories.py` attach an `httpx.Request` before returning: the httpx versions this project supports (0.24–0.28) raise `RuntimeError` from `response.url` / `raise_for_status()` if no `request` is attached to a `Response`, and the public `.request` *getter* itself raises when unset (check the private `response._request` attribute instead).

## Config — YAML files + a persona directory, cached at startup

| Source | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `settings.yaml` | LLM, TTS, STT endpoints and parameters, general chat parameters, MCP server list. `general.personas_directory` (default `Personas`) names the persona directory — **yaml-only**, no API/UI field |
| `Personas/` (one directory per persona) | Persona definitions — the single source of truth. See **Persona storage** below |
| `personas.yaml` | **Legacy only.** If present (and no `Personas/` dir), it is migrated to directories once at startup, then renamed to `personas.yaml.bak` and ignored forever |
| `chatrooms.yaml` | Chat room groupings (may not exist; code handles gracefully) |

All three are loaded once at startup and cached as module-level globals in `app/config.py`.
In request handlers, **always use** `get_settings()`, `get_personas()`, `get_chatrooms()` — never call `load_*()` directly.
To force a re-read of all three files, call `app.config.reload_all()`.
**Caveat:** `reload_all()` does NOT re-run MCP tool discovery — the tool cache in `app/services/tool_registry.py` is built once at startup. Changes to the `mcp:` section of settings.yaml require a full app restart.

## Persona storage

Personas live in `Personas/<Name>/` (directory = `sanitize_persona_dirname(name)`; name may differ, e.g. `O'Brien` → `OBrien`). All file I/O lives in `app/services/persona_store.py` (framework-agnostic; routers and config import from there).

Per-persona files:

| File | Content | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| `prompt.md` | YAML frontmatter (`description`, `router_hints`, `avatar_color`, `allow_tool_calls`, `memory_size`) + system prompt body | `name` is stored only when it differs from the directory name; parsed/serialized by `parse_frontmatter()` / `build_prompt_md()`. `memory_size` (0–16384 bytes, default 8192) is the persona's memory budget — `0` disables memories; an invalid/out-of-range value warns and falls back to the default. Malformed frontmatter degrades the whole file to the prompt body with a warning — never a crash |
| `memories.txt` | One memory per line (newlines inside a memory are flattened) | Persistent memory for the persona, written by the built-in `add_memory` tool and purged oldest-first when the file exceeds `memory_size`. Absent = no memories yet |
| `language.txt` | Single line: reference-audio language code | Absent → `en` (with warning) |
| `ref.wav` | TTS reference audio | Fixed filename — never user-chosen |
| `ref.txt` | Transcript of `ref.wav` | A persona is TTS-capable only when **both** are present (and non-blank) |
| `image.<ext>` | Avatar (png/jpg/jpeg/gif/webp) | One per persona; the editor's "replace image" uploads a new file and deletes the old one |

Startup decision matrix in `app/config.py::load_personas()` (lazy-imports `persona_store` to dodge a cycle):

| `personas.yaml` | `Personas/` dir | Behaviour |
|-----------------|-----------------|-----------|
| no | no | Create the (empty) dir, warn once; empty persona list |
| no | yes | Scan |
| yes | no | **Migrate** (see below) |
| yes | yes | Skip the YAML with a warning (dir wins); both sources kept on disk |

**Migration** (`persona_store.migrate_from_legacy_yaml()`): converts the old schema to per-persona directories. Each persona gets a `prompt.md` (frontmatter + system prompt) and `language.txt`, and the files referenced by its `avatar_image` / `reference_audio` / `reference_audio_transcript` **paths** are copied in as `image<ext>` / `ref.wav` / `ref.txt`. Success → the YAML is renamed to `personas.yaml.bak` so it never re-migrates. **Fatal** error (malformed YAML, unwritable directory, disk full) → raise `PersonaMigrationError` with the YAML left **untouched** and the partially created `Personas/` directory removed best-effort, so the next startup retries cleanly. **Minor** error (a referenced file missing, unreadable, or the wrong format — e.g. a non-wav `reference_audio`) → logged, that file skipped, migration continues. The YAML is the source of truth until the rename succeeds.

**Rename moves the directory (when safe).** A persona *name* change rewrites the `prompt.md` `name:` field AND renames the persona's directory to `sanitize_persona_dirname(new_name)` — unless the sanitized name is empty or the target directory already exists (two distinct names can sanitize to the same directory, e.g. `O'Brien` and `O*Brien`), in which case the directory is kept and the frontmatter `name:` field preserves the identity. The move happens after the field writes and is best-effort: a skipped or failed rename keeps the old directory and the save still succeeds (a plain save — no name change — never moves a directory). Deleting a persona deletes the directory. `GET /api/personas` returns personas in raw directory/creation order — sorting is a frontend concern (see **Persona list ordering**).

## Architecture

- **Backend**: FastAPI. Entry point: `app/main.py`. Routers in `app/routers/`, external service clients in `app/services/`.
- **Session**: Single global `session` singleton in `app/session.py`. Intentional — this is a single-user app. No auth, no database — the `chatrooms/` directory is the only persistent storage. Tracks `current_room` and persists messages to disk automatically. `session.build_llm_messages()` constructs the per-call LLM payload: the responding persona's system prompt, then history remapped so user messages stay `user`, the responder's own messages stay `assistant`, and *other personas'* messages are re-mapped to `user` with a `[Name]: <text>` prefix — this avoids consecutive `assistant` messages (which many LLMs reject with 400) and stops the model treating another persona's words as its own. History is optionally capped at the last `general.max_turns_for_context` entries (default 6).
- **Persistence**: Per-room JSON + audio files under `chatrooms/<room>/`. Handled by `app/persistence.py` (framework-agnostic) and `app/routers/persistence.py` (audio upload/serving endpoints). Created lazily on first write.
- **MCP tools**: `app/services/mcp_client.py` speaks MCP (JSON-RPC 2.0 over the Streamable HTTP transport, protocol version 2025-03-26) with a *stateless, per-call* session — `initialize` runs on every discovery/call, no persistent sessions. `app/services/tool_registry.py` caches the discovered tools once at startup (called from `app/main.py` lifespan) and maps tool name → server; duplicate tool names across servers: first listed server wins. The cache is not refreshed by `reload_all()` — `mcp:` changes need a full restart. The `mcp:` section of `settings.yaml` is **yaml-only** (no UI, no API field) — `update_settings` in `app/routers/settings.py` copies it over from the current cache, otherwise a UI settings save would wipe it. Personas with `allow_tool_calls` run `stream_chat_with_tools()` in `app/services/llm.py` (agentic loop; the final round is sent without `tools` to force a text answer). Tool rounds are local to the loop — they are NOT persisted to the chat history. MCP server URLs are validated at config load (must start with `http://` or `https://`) so a scheme-less typo fails loudly at startup instead of surfacing as per-request connection timeouts.

- **LLM API key (remote LLMs)**: `app/services/llm_auth.py` resolves an optional API key once per process from the `TALKWITHME_LLM_API_KEY` env var (priority) or an `llm_api_key` file in the project root (`llm_api_key = <value>` format; `llm_api_key.example` is the committed template). The key is **deliberately not** part of `AppSettings` — `settings.yaml` is tracked in git and `GET/PUT /api/settings` round-trip the settings models, so a model field would leak the key to disk and onto the API surface. It is never logged (the startup log reports only `configured`/`not configured`), never shown in the UI, and not reloadable at runtime (restart required). `llm.py` sends it as `Authorization: Bearer <key>` on every LLM call via its `_llm_client()` factory (both the streaming and the non-streaming router call build clients through it), and `llm.warn_if_plaintext_llm()` logs `Warning: your LLM connection uses http; your chats are sent in cleartext.` once per distinct URL — called from the lifespan and after every settings save (a save may (re)introduce an `http://` URL).
- **Built-in tools**: `app/services/builtin.py` registers tools that run *locally* instead of over MCP (currently `add_memory`, which appends to the persona's `memories.txt` under its `memory_size` budget). They are offered on top of the MCP tools to tool-enabled personas, are dispatched before any MCP lookup in `stream_chat_with_tools()`, and never touch the network. Built-in names are **reserved**: `load_tools()` silently skips (with a warning) any MCP server advertising a built-in name. Availability is per persona (`memory_size > 0`) and gated by `general.enable_persona_memories` — see **Persona memories** in Chat flow.
- **Settings update contract**: `PUT /api/settings` treats the `general:` section as a *partial update* — omitted fields (or an absent `general` section) keep their current values; only fields explicitly sent override. `GeneralSettingsRequest` in `app/models.py` uses `Optional` fields defaulting to `None`, and `update_settings` in `app/routers/settings.py` merges via `model_dump(exclude_none=True)`. Dialogs that don't edit general settings (the Servers dialog) must NOT send a `general` section, and the router must NOT rebuild `GeneralConfig` from request-body defaults — doing so is exactly how `show_tool_calls` got reset to `true` on every Servers-dialog save. If you add a new field to `GeneralConfig`, the merge preserves it automatically; no per-field wiring needed. The LLM/TTS/STT sections are full replacements, normalized on save: blank base URLs → `None` (which deactivates the feature via `is_active`). Changes take effect immediately — no restart. TTS engine parameters are a generic untyped map, `tts.parameters` (name → value; the hard-coded `num_steps`/`guidance_scale`/`seed` fields are gone — see `docs/feature_TTS_generification.md`): a legacy `tts:` block in settings.yaml is folded into `parameters` at **load** time (`TTSConfig` before-validator, `app/config.py`), so the old keys leave disk on the first save; "absent key = let the engine decide" replaced the seed 0→None convention. On save, `tts.parameters` is 422-validated against the cached TTS capabilities doc — **only** when that doc belongs to the exact `base_url` being saved (stale doc after an engine switch, negative cache, or empty cache → skip; the server's own 422 is the backstop), and a successful save always calls `tts_client.invalidate_capabilities()` (slot clear only, no inline refetch — the save path is synchronous and offline-safe).
- **Logging**: `app/main.py` configures logging via `logging.basicConfig(level=..., ...)` at import time (a no-op if the root logger already has handlers), because uvicorn's default config leaves the root logger at WARNING, which silently swallows every app `logger.info()` call (this is why per-server MCP discovery lines were invisible while failure `WARNING`s showed). The level defaults to INFO but is overridden for the run by `TALKWITHME_LOG_LEVEL` (a standard level name, case-insensitive; see `app/main.py::_resolve_root_log_level` and the README "Logging" section) — an invalid value warns and falls back to INFO. The `httpx` logger is separately pinned to WARNING because it logs one line per HTTP request. Note: `uvicorn --log-level` only affects uvicorn's own loggers, not the app's.
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JS SPA, no bundler. Modules in `static/` communicate via shared globals in `state.js`. See the table below:

| File | Responsibility |
|------|---------------|
| `state.js` | Shared globals (personas, session state, chat room state, TTS/STT flags, audio queue, message IDs) |
| `app.js` | Bootstrap, health checks, event listener setup, session management |
| `chat.js` | Message rendering, SSE stream handling (incl. `tool_call` chips), sending messages, persisted history rendering, audio playback buttons |
| `persistence.js` | History loading, audio upload helpers, audio URL generation |
| `persona.js` | Persona sidebar + editor modal (CRUD, incl. memory size field + "Clear saved memories") |
| `chatrooms.js` | Chat room dropdown, room filtering, room editor (incl. echo chamber toggle), persona picker modal, room switching with history load |
| `settings.js` | Servers modal (LLM/TTS/STT config) |
| `tts-params.js` | Dynamic TTS parameter section of the Servers modal: pure core (capabilities doc → widget specs, rendered form → collected values, values → validation error) + DOM builders for the parameter rows and the engine info block |
| `gen-settings.js` | General settings modal (max persona replies, name mentions, context turns, tool-call visibility, persona memories toggle) |
| `tts.js` | TTS synthesis, audio queues, Web Audio playback, audio persistence |
| `stt.js` | Microphone recording, STT proxy, transcript insertion, audio persistence |
| `theme.js` | Theme toggle |
| `utils.js` | Shared helpers (incl. `comparePersonasByName()`, the shared case-insensitive persona-name comparator) |

**Persona list ordering**: Anywhere a list of personas is shown to the user (the sidebar, the persona editor modal, the persona picker modal, and anything added in the future), it must be sorted alphabetically and case-insensitively using `comparePersonasByName()` from `utils.js`. The shared `personas` global is pre-sorted in `loadPersonas()` (`app.js`), but each render function sorts its own input list rather than trusting the caller's order. **Do not** rely on `GET /api/personas` returning any particular order — the backend intentionally returns personas in raw directory/creation order; sorting is a display concern and belongs in the frontend only.

## Chat flow

`POST /api/chat` streams SSE. Every event is a single `data: <JSON>\n\n` line; the `type` field is always present, and the frontend switches on it in `handleSSEEvent()` in `chat.js`. Event types: `start`, `token`, `tool_call`, `done`, `error`, `complete`.
The request body includes `chat_room` (which room to persist to) and `message_id` (frontend-generated UUID for audio association).

**Persona pool.** `_resolve_room_personas()` in `app/routers/chat.py` is the authoritative source of eligibility: the `"default"` room (or any room not present in `chatrooms.yaml`) includes all personas; a named room is limited to its assigned personas, filtered to those that still exist. It deliberately does NOT read the frontend-maintained `session.active_personas`.

**Persona selection modes:** `"router"` (LLM picks via a non-streaming `chat_completion()` at `temperature=0.1`, `max_tokens=16`; the prompt includes each eligible persona's `router_hints` plus the last `max_turns_for_context` turns of context; an unrecognized name or LLM failure falls back to random), `"random"` (uniform over eligible personas), or an explicit persona name (validated against the room; unknown values fall back to random).

**Multiple replies.** `general.max_persona_replies` (1–4, capped at the number of eligible personas) controls how many personas answer one user message: multiple `start`/`token`/`done` cycles, one per responding persona. The first responder comes from the selection mode; each subsequent one is a random non-repeating pick from the remaining eligible personas.

**Message IDs.** Both `start` and `done` carry `message_id` (server-generated UUID for that persona's assistant message); `start` also carries `user_message_id` (the frontend's ID, echoed back).
`start` carries the assistant ID first **on purpose**: the frontend stamps it onto streaming TTS items at enqueue time, so the ID must be generated *before* the `start` event is emitted — moving it back after the stream reintroduces cross-turn audio misattribution.

**Echo chamber.** Each room has an `echo_chamber` flag (set via `PUT /api/chatrooms/{name}/echo-chamber`, toggled in the room editor; the `default` room cannot be modified). When enabled for the active room, the LLM is bypassed entirely: exactly one persona (picked per the normal selection mode) echoes the user's message verbatim as a single `token` event, and `max_persona_replies` is forced to 1.

**Tool calls.** `tool_call` is only emitted while a tool-enabled persona's agentic loop is running, and only when `general.show_tool_calls` is true (the server suppresses the event, not the frontend); payload: `{type, persona, tool_name, arguments, result, failed}`. `failed` is a server-computed boolean (tool error, unknown tool, or unparseable/truncated arguments) — the frontend styles the chip from it, not by sniffing the result string. Tool calls whose arguments are not valid JSON (typically truncated at `max_tokens`) are never executed; the LLM receives an `Error: ...` result and can retry. The agentic loop is capped at `mcp.max_tool_iterations` rounds (default 8) per persona reply.

**Persona memories.** Each persona has a `memory_size` budget (0–16384 bytes, default 8192, 0 = disabled) stored in its `prompt.md` frontmatter, plus a `memories.txt` with one flattened line per memory. Two global/per-persona gates control the feature: `general.enable_persona_memories` (default true) and the persona's own budget > 0. When both pass, the chat router appends the persona's current memories to its system prompt before every LLM call, and the built-in `add_memory` tool is offered to tool-enabled personas — its success/error strings are returned to the LLM verbatim (it never sees exceptions). `memories.txt` is purged oldest-first whenever it exceeds the budget: on save (in `add_memory`), best-effort on persona update when the budget is lowered, and on the read path before memory injection (via `persona_store.purge_memories_to_limit`, a cheap no-op when the file is within budget) — so a file inflated by an external editor is normalized before it ever reaches the LLM. The file contents themselves are never cached: `read_memories()` re-reads the disk on every chat request. The editor's "Clear saved memories" sends `clear_memories=true` **only** after an explicit click, and the update endpoint's `memory_size` form field is **required** — an omitted value must 422 rather than silently reset the budget.

**Global system prompt.** `general.global_system_prompt` (default empty string) holds instructions that apply to ALL personas — the replacement for copy-pasting the same rules into every persona's prompt (e.g. "no markdown, TTS can't render it"). In the chat flow, a non-blank value is appended to the end of each persona's final system prompt, separated by a blank line and placed *after* any injected memories, so global rules sit at the very end of the prompt (see `_with_global_system_prompt()` in `app/routers/chat.py`). Whitespace-only values are treated as empty; surrounding whitespace is stripped before appending. It is edited in the General settings modal (the textarea under Max Turns for Context) and round-trips through the standard `general:` partial update: omitted = keep, explicit `""` = clear.

`general.persona_name_mentions` (default true) controls whether the frontend prefixes assistant bubbles with the persona's name. It is frontend-only — it has no backend or LLM effect.

## Chat persistence

Every message is persisted to disk automatically — no configuration toggle needed.

- **Location**: `chatrooms/<room_name>/history.json` + audio files alongside it.
- **Format**: JSON with `datetime` (ISO-8601) and `messages` array. Each message has `id` (UUID), `sender` ("USER" or persona name), `text`, and `audio` (array of filenames).
**Audio files**: Named `<message_uuid>_<index>.<ext>` (e.g. `d4ee3044_1.wav`). Extension derived from MIME type, falls back to `.bin`. Audio that arrives *before* the message row exists (STT recordings upload before the chat request creates the user message; streaming TTS sentences upload while the reply is still streaming) is staged as `<message_uuid>_pending_<hex8>.<ext>` and automatically attached to the message's audio list when `persist_message()` runs — the staging registry lives in `app/persistence.py` (`_pending_audio`), in-memory only, so a process restart in that window leaves the (valid) file unreferenced.
- **Room switching**: `GET /api/session/load-room/<room_name>` loads persisted history and populates the in-memory session. The name is validated against the room-name alphabet (422) before it touches disk — it also becomes the session's current room, which a later `POST /api/session/new` feeds to `clear_room()`.
- **New Chat**: `POST /api/session/new` clears both in-memory history and deletes all files in the room's persistence directory.
- **Room-name alphabet**: Room names are used verbatim as directory names under the persistence root, so the shared check `is_valid_room_name()` in `app/config.py` (`^[a-zA-Z0-9 _-]+$` — no dots, no slashes) gates every endpoint that accepts a room name: `POST /api/chat`'s `chat_room` body field (422 at the Pydantic model, before the handler, LLM, or persistence layer runs), `GET /api/session/load-room/<room_name>` (422), room creation, and the persistence router's `room` query/path params (422). An unvalidated `../x` would `mkdir()` and write `history.json` outside the persistence root — dots are the tell, and room names never need them.
- **Audio upload**: `POST /api/persist/audio?room=<room>` accepts base64 audio and appends it to the message's audio list. `room` (422, room-name alphabet) and `message_id` (422, no path separators) are validated up front — both flow into on-disk paths (a room dir is `mkdir`ed, the ID is interpolated into the filename), so an unvalidated `../x` would escape the persistence root.
- **Audio playback**: `GET /api/persist/audio/<room>/<filename>` serves persisted audio files. `room` is validated against the room-name alphabet (422) and `filename` must be a plain filename (404) — otherwise a `..` segment (literal or `%2F`-encoded; uvicorn percent-decodes the target *before* routing, so it arrives as a legal single path segment) could read files outside the room's directory.
- **Single-message deletion**: `DELETE /api/persist/message/<room>/<message_id>` removes one message's row from `history.json` and deletes all of its audio files (the row's `audio` list, its `_pending_audio` staging-registry entries, and a best-effort sweep for any remaining `<message_id>_`-prefixed file) — all under the same history lock that serializes uploads, so the `history.json` read-modify-write is atomic with respect to concurrent audio uploads (an upload that lands *after* the delete re-stages and leaves at most one orphaned staged file — the same residue class as the pre-existing crash orphans). When the room is the session's current room, the matching in-memory `ChatMessage` is removed too (the session stamps and tracks message IDs), so a deleted message stops reaching the LLM from the next turn. 404 when the room has no message with that ID (nothing deleted).

The `SessionManager.add_user_message()` and `add_assistant_message()` methods take a `message_id` parameter and call `persistence.persist_message()` automatically.

## TTS and STT are independent

Each has its own `enabled` + `base_url` in `settings.yaml`. Use the `is_active` property (requires both enabled AND a non-empty base_url) instead of checking `enabled` alone.

**TTS server** (`app/routers/tts.py`, `app/services/tts_client.py`): The `/api/tts`, `/api/tts/health`, and `/api/tts/capabilities` routes live in `app/routers/tts.py`. The client functions `synthesize()`, `check_tts_health()`, and `get_capabilities()` are in `app/services/tts_client.py`. A persona is TTS-capable only when both `reference_audio` and `reference_audio_transcript` are set (computed as the `Persona.tts_capable` property in `app/config.py`); `/api/tts` returns 404 for an unknown persona, 400 for a non-TTS-capable one, 503 if the reference files can't be read, and 503 when the *cached* capabilities doc for the current base_url says `reference_audio: null` (a non-cloning engine cannot serve persona TTS; the router check never fetches — streaming issues one `/synthesize` per sentence). The cache-cold window is covered by `synthesize()` itself, which refuses (502) when the doc it just fetched says `reference_audio: null`, so the first call after a cache invalidation cannot be answered in the engine's default voice; the shared predicate `doc_supports_reference_audio()` backs both checks. `/api/tts/capabilities` serves the engine's capabilities document raw (no wrapper — the frontend gates on `schema_version`); 503 when TTS is inactive or the server has no `/capabilities`. An optional `?base_url=<url>` probes a SPECIFIC url — the Servers modal's "Refresh" (reconnect) button and the Base-URL change listener, where the url may be an unsaved edit: it bypasses the `is_active` gate (the saved config may point elsewhere), scheme-validates the url up front (422 for a scheme-less typo, so the user can fix the field in place instead of hanging on a connect timeout), and fetches via `tts_client.fetch_capabilities_url()` — a one-shot that never reads or writes the single-slot capabilities cache (a probe must not re-key the slot the synthesis path relies on). The `/synthesize` payload is built from the cached doc (plan T4): only advertised fields are sent; the four app-managed fields (`text`, `audio_base64`, `reference_text`, `language`) are never sourced from `settings.tts.parameters`; the persona's language code is sent only if the engine's `language` parameter accepts it (code-only contract — TalkWithMe never maps codes; a rejected code is omitted with a warning). A 422 from `/synthesize` invalidates the doc cache, refetches, rebuilds the payload, and retries exactly once (stale-doc self-heal after an engine switch); the server's 422 detail is logged at warning either way. With no doc available (server without `/capabilities`), synthesis falls back to the core vocabulary plus all configured `tts.parameters` unfiltered, with one warning per base_url. TTS supports a `streaming` mode (sentence-by-sentence) controlled by `settings.tts.streaming`, reported in `/api/tts/health` so the frontend can pick its queueing strategy.

**STT server** (`app/routers/stt.py`, `app/services/stt_client.py`): The `/api/stt` and `/api/stt/health` routes live in `app/routers/stt.py`. The client functions `transcribe_audio()` and `check_stt_health()` are in `app/services/stt_client.py`, forwarding the audio as multipart form data to an OpenAI-compatible `/v1/audio/transcriptions` endpoint. `/api/stt` returns 503 when STT is not `is_active`. STT requires no per-persona config.

**STT flow**: The microphone button in the input bar (or **Ctrl+Space**) uses `getUserMedia` + `MediaRecorder`. Click to start, click again to stop. The recorded blob is base64-encoded and POSTed to `/api/stt` with the actual `MediaRecorder` MIME type (browsers differ: webm, ogg, mp4, …). On success, the transcribed text is appended to the input box (never replaces), the recording is persisted to the current room via `persistence.js` with a playback button injected into the live user bubble, and `sendMessage()` is called automatically. Any non-2xx response (or a fetch failure) leaves the mic button disabled for the rest of the session.

Both TTS and STT capture audio and persist it to the current room via `persistence.js`. TTS audio is associated with the assistant message ID issued in the `start` event (stamped onto each TTS item at enqueue time — never looked up in shared state at fetch-resolution time). STT audio is associated with the user message ID generated before `sendMessage()`.

## Chat rooms

Chat rooms are stored in `chatrooms.yaml` and managed via `get_chatrooms()` / `save_chatrooms()` in `app/config.py`.

- The implicit **`"default"` room** always exists and always contains all configured personas. It cannot be created, modified, or deleted (the API rejects attempts with 400/409), and `GET /api/chatrooms/all` / `GET /api/chatrooms/default` synthesize it on the fly from the persona list.
- Room names match case-insensitively and may only contain letters, numbers, spaces, hyphens, and underscores; creating a duplicate (or the reserved name `default`) is rejected with 409.
- New rooms start with zero personas assigned; assigning a nonexistent persona returns 422.
- Switching rooms loads persisted history from disk into the session rather than clearing it.
- Deleting a room also deletes its persistence directory (`chatrooms/<name>/` — history + audio) via `persistence.delete_room()`: a re-created room with the same name starts with an empty history instead of resurrecting the deleted room's conversation. When the deleted room was the session's active room, the session is reset to `"default"` (its persisted history is loaded into memory) — otherwise it would keep pointing at a room that no longer exists, and the next message would recreate the deleted room's directory.

## Persona CRUD cascades

Renaming or deleting a persona cascades to `chatrooms.yaml` via `_cascade_persona_rename()` / `_cascade_persona_delete()` in `app/routers/personas.py`. Keep this in sync if data models change. Persona create/update/delete/clone are **multipart** (`POST`/`PUT` with `Form` text fields + optional `UploadFile` avatar / reference audio); there is no JSON request model for them — the `PersonaResponse`/`PersonaDetailResponse` in `app/models.py` are the only persona request/response shapes, and they carry file *contents* and boolean capability flags rather than paths. `memory_size` is a `Form` field on both create (default 8192) and update (**required** — no server-side default, so an omitted value 422s instead of silently resetting the budget); `clear_memories` is an optional boolean on update only; cloning carries the source's `memory_size` over.

## Pydantic models

All request/response shapes and config models live in `app/models.py` and `app/config.py`. Add new fields there, not inline in routers.
