# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

m3u4me — a self-hosted, single-user, local-network IPTV M3U playlist manager. Playlists/channels never leave the box it runs on. Express backend + Vite-built React 19 frontend, persisted to a single JSON file on disk. Per the README, the codebase is AI-generated with the maintainer (a non-developer) reviewing/steering — keep changes readable and avoid introducing patterns that need heavy explanation. There is no test suite in this repo.

## Commands

- `npm run dev` — `tsx server.ts`; runs Express with Vite in middleware mode (HMR dev server), on port 8080 (override with `PORT` env var).
- `npm run build` — `vite build` → `dist/`.
- `npm run start` — `node server.ts` in production mode; requires `dist/` to already exist (run `build` first). Serves `dist/` statically with SPA fallback.
- `npm run preview` — `vite preview`.
- `npm run lint` — `eslint . && tsc --noEmit`. This is also the typecheck command; there's no separate `typecheck` script.
- `npm run clean` — `rm -rf dist`.
- No test runner is configured.
- Production process management is PM2 via `ecosystem.config.cjs` (`pm2 start ecosystem.config.cjs`).

## Architecture

### One backend file, one JSON database

- `server.ts` is the entire backend — a single Express app with every route registered inline inside `startServer()`. No router modules, no ORM.
- Persistence is a single JSON file, `data/db.json` (gitignored, auto-created on boot with empty arrays). `readDb()`/`writeDb()` synchronously read/rewrite the *whole file* on every mutation — there are no transactions and no migration framework (one-off migrations like `migrateShortIds()` just run unconditionally at boot). This is adequate only because the app is single-user/local; don't add code that assumes concurrent writers.
- Auth secrets live in a separate gitignored file, `data/auth.json`.
- In dev (`NODE_ENV !== 'production'`), `server.ts` creates a Vite server in middleware mode and mounts it; in production it serves `dist/` statically with an `index.html` catch-all for client-side routing.

### Data model — duplicated by hand across backend and frontend

`server.ts` and `src/apiClient.ts` each declare their own copies of `Playlist`, `Channel`, `EpgSource`, `ChannelPoolSource`, etc. There's no shared types package — when changing a shape, update both files.

- **`Playlist`** — has a `shortId` (small incrementing integer used in the public `/[shortId]` and `/[shortId]/epg` URLs) and an `exportId` (UUID, legacy long-form export route kept for backwards compatibility).
- **`Channel`** — belongs to one playlist + one category string; `order` drives manual drag-reordering.
- **`EpgSource`** — an XMLTV URL (optionally gzip) or Xtream Codes credentials. Parsed programme/channel data is cached **in memory only** (`epgCache` Map keyed by source id) — it is never written to `db.json`, so it's rebuilt from scratch on every server restart via `refreshEpgSource()`, which runs for every stored source at boot and again on a 5-minute interval check against each source's `refreshIntervalHours`.
- **`ChannelPoolSource` / `ChannelPoolEntry` / `ChannelPoolChangeLog`** — a separate "bulk source" concept, distinct from playlists: an Xtream account, a playlist URL, or an uploaded file that you browse and cherry-pick channels from into an actual playlist. Entries *are* persisted to `db.json` (mirrored into an in-memory `channelPoolCache` for the running session). Each refresh diffs old vs. new entries by stream URL and appends an added/removed/renamed changelog entry, pruned to entries newer than 90 days.

### Auth is bespoke — and unrelated to `AuthContext`

- Real auth: PBKDF2-hashed password + a one-time-shown recovery key, both in `data/auth.json`. Login issues a random token held only in an in-memory `Set` (`activeSessions`) — sessions do not survive a server restart. The middleware mounted at `app.use('/api', ...)` gates every `/api/*` route except `publicPaths` (`/auth/status`, `/auth/login`, `/auth/recover`). If no password has ever been set, auth is a complete no-op.
- The frontend stores the token in `sessionStorage` (`src/apiClient.ts`: `getSessionToken`/`setSessionToken`) and routes every call through `authFetch()`, which attaches `Authorization: Bearer …` and fires a global `auth-expired` window event on a 401 (handled in `App.tsx` to re-lock the UI via `LockScreen`).
- `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` (`useAuth()`) is a **vestigial, unrelated stub** — it always returns a hardcoded dummy local user and has no connection to the password system above. Don't conflate the two when touching auth.
- The short playlist/EPG URLs (`GET /:shortId`, `GET /:shortId/epg`) are registered outside the `/api` prefix and are therefore never auth-gated — intentional, since IPTV players/EPG grabbers hitting these can't supply a bearer token.

### Frontend data flow: no query library — hand-rolled fetch + event bus

- `src/apiClient.ts` exports one `api` object holding every REST call, plus fetch-on-mount hooks (`usePlaylists`, `useChannels`, `useEpgSources`, `useChannelPoolSources`).
- There's no cache/invalidation library. After a mutation, call the matching `trigger*Refresh()` (`triggerRefresh` / `triggerEpgRefresh` / `triggerChannelPoolRefresh`), which dispatches a `refresh` event on a plain `EventTarget` (`dbEvents` / `epgEvents` / `channelPoolEvents`); every hook subscribed to that bus refetches. Forgetting to call the right trigger after adding a new mutation leaves the UI silently stale.
- Cross-cutting UI/app state (active playlist/category, sidebar width, theme, accent color, hide-URLs, etc.) lives in one Zustand store, `src/store.ts`. Only cosmetic fields are persisted to localStorage via `partialize` (`logoBgColor`, `accentColor`, `isDarkMode`, `isAmoledMode`, `is24Hour`) — navigation/selection state resets on reload.

### Three feature surfaces, one `Dashboard.tsx` shell

`Dashboard.tsx` renders a sidebar (playlist/source/EPG list depending on tab) + a main viewer, switched by `activeView` in the store:

1. **My Playlists** — `PlaylistEditor.tsx` + `CategoryList.tsx`. Drag-reorder (dnd-kit) for both channels and categories, inline click-to-edit fields, multi-select bulk move/delete/find-replace, a stream health checker (HEAD, falling back to GET, per channel), TVG-ID autocomplete against the EPG pool, and client-side pagination (100 channels/page) per category.
2. **Sources** — `ChannelPoolViewer.tsx` + `ChannelPoolUpdateLog.tsx` (collapsible right-hand drawer) + `AddChannelPoolSourceDialog.tsx`. Browse/search a channel-pool source and bulk-add selected channels into a real playlist (with optional category override).
3. **EPG** — `EpgViewer.tsx` (a manually-windowed/virtualized timeline grid, not a library) rendering `/api/epg-sources/:id/now`, plus `EpgProgramDialog.tsx` and `AddEpgSourceDialog.tsx`. `BulkEpgAssignDialog.tsx` fuzzy-matches (trigram + word-overlap scoring, computed client-side) playlist channel names against EPG channel names and bulk-assigns `tvgId` in chunks (with cancel/revert support). `AssignTvgIdDialog.tsx` is the reverse flow: pick one EPG channel, then assign it to channels chosen from across any playlist.

M3U/XSPF parsing for channel-pool sources happens entirely server-side (`parseM3uToChannelPoolEntries` / `parseXspfToChannelPoolEntries` in `server.ts`) — there is no client-side parser; an earlier `src/utils/m3uParser.ts` that duplicated this logic client-side was removed once nothing imported it.

### Styling conventions

- Tailwind v4 (CSS-first config via `@tailwindcss/vite`, no `tailwind.config.js`). Two custom variants are defined in `src/index.css`: `dark` (class-based, toggled on `<html>`) and `amoled` (stacks with `dark`, e.g. `amoled:dark:bg-black`, for true-black surfaces).
- `.md-btn` and `.elev-{1,2,4,8,16,24}` in `index.css` are hand-rolled Material Design 2 ripple/elevation utilities used throughout instead of a component library.
- Accent color is a user setting (`useStore().accentColor`) applied via inline `style={{ color/backgroundColor: accentColor }}` rather than Tailwind classes, since it's arbitrary/user-picked. `contrastText()` and `accentAlpha()` in `store.ts` compute readable foreground text and tinted backgrounds against it.

### Non-`/api` routes served directly by `server.ts`

- `GET /:shortId` — the playlist as `#EXTM3U` text (`serveM3U()`).
- `GET /:shortId/epg` — an XMLTV `<tv>` document built from the in-memory EPG cache, filtered to that playlist's channels' `tvgId`s.
- `GET /api/playlists/:exportId.m3u` — legacy long-form export URL, kept only for backwards compatibility with links generated before `shortId` existed.
