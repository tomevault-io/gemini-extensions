# MK Deception agent guide

This file is the operational entry point for coding agents working in this
repository. The supported target is the USA GameCube release, `GQNE5D`.

## Repository rules

- Preserve unrelated worktree changes. Inspect `git status --short` before and
  after editing.
- Treat retail assembly, call sites, symbols, relocations, and object layout as
  evidence. Decompiler output is a hypothesis, not ground truth.
- Edit source under `src/`, declarations under `include/`, and project metadata
  only when the evidence requires it. Do not hand-edit generated files in
  `build/`.
- Keep matching source readable and structurally honest. Do not force registers
  with `register`, fake `volatile`, dead sinks, incorrect prototypes, invented
  fields, embedded assembly, or unstructured `goto`.
- Exception: a local `goto` is allowed as a last resort when all of these hold:
  - Structured alternatives (early return, `break`, flag, shared exit, helper
    inline) were measured and regress the match.
  - The shape has backing evidence, such as matched references of the same
    vendor code in other decomps (MSL `__dec2num` uses `goto done` in both
    bfbb and TP/dusk), or the `goto` gives simpler, more honest control flow
    than a contrived `do { ... } while (0)`, one-trip loop, or dummy flag that
    exists only to force a match.
  - The jump stays inside one function and targets a label in that same
    function. Prefer a forward jump to a shared exit or cleanup. Never jump into a nested
    block past initializations, never emulate a loop that `for`/`while`
    expresses, and never use `setjmp`/`longjmp` or computed gotos.

  Record the evidence (measured alternatives and the reference) in the task
  report, not in a function comment.
- Exception: adding a function to the assembly-sequence mechanism is an
  extraordinarily rare action and requires explicit user permission for that
  specific function. Proof that a function is genuine handwritten assembly is
  necessary but does not itself grant permission. With approval, the function
  may invoke a `SEQ_<function>()` macro generated under `build/` from that
  version's retail-derived assembly and may be added to
  `config/<version>/asm_sequences.json`. Do not commit instruction payloads,
  synthesize a fallback, or use this path for ordinary compiler-generated
  functions. Automated, unattended, or goal-driven matching work must skip a
  function once evidence shows that it requires assembly; it must not add an
  assembly sequence or seek to satisfy the goal through one without explicit
  user permission.
- Make one coherent matching change at a time, rebuild, and inspect the same
  objdiff mismatch before trying another change.
- Preserve or explicitly account for the final retail SHA-1 check. A fuzzy
  percentage alone is not validation.

## Post-attempt status policy

After every matching attempt (including a reverted trial or no-edit stop),
if the function remains below 100%, update one source comment immediately above
the affected function:

```c
/* TODO: [near miss] 98.84%; equivalent latch CFG remains; stop at coloring. */
```

Required format: `TODO: [status] quick explanation`. Canonical statuses:

- `borked`: algorithm, CFG, ABI, or layout is demonstrably wrong.
- `breakthrough needed`: unresolved structural cause; name missing evidence.
- `breakthrough`: structural cause fixed; name remaining mismatch/next check.
- `near miss`: behavior/structure agree; localized codegen/relocation residue.
- `blocked`: tool, input, or authorization prevents verification.

Describe retained source, not the rejected candidate. Include current objdiff
score when available and concrete residual/next action; use one or two lines.
Replace previous status instead of appending history. For shared edits, update
functions whose result/classification changes. Never infer an exact match from
fuzzy improvement. Comments do not replace whole-TU checks, full build, or retail
SHA-1.

Once a function reaches a measured 100%, remove all matching-progress TODOs and
comments associated with it, including old percentages, near-match notes, soft
ceilings, attempt history, and `TODO: [matched]` markers. Do not replace them with
a new 100% comment. Preserve comments that explain behavior, algorithms, ABI,
layout, or other code semantics; if a comment mixes explanation with progress
tracking, remove only the tracking content. Unrelated functional TODOs remain.
Keep verification evidence and the distinction between report-exact, data-value
exact, and link-exact in reports and project metadata, not function comments.

## Local agent workspace

Use the Git-ignored `.agent-work/` directory for local agent artifacts:

- `issues/<task>/`: issue notes, investigation logs, and reproduction details.
- `patches/<task>/`: proposed `.patch` or `.diff` files and application notes.
- `decomp/<campaign>/`: matching reports, audits, scores, and evidence indexes.

Create these directories on demand. Use descriptive lowercase task names with
hyphens; include the base commit, affected symbols/files, commands, and validation
results in each task's notes. Keep patch files inert until deliberately applied.
Do not put credentials, retail images, or tool checkouts here.

Continue using `.scratches/` for compiler experiments and generated
comparison/build output. Reports may reference those local paths.
Keep reusable conventions and diagnostic playbooks in tracked `docs/decomp/`;
keep actual fixes in `src/`, `include/`, or the relevant project files. Ignored
artifacts are local-only: tracked documentation must explain its reusable finding
without requiring an ignored report. Promote supporting evidence deliberately
when it must be available to other contributors.

## Initialize the repository

Python is the only hard prerequisite for the bootstrap. Git and Ninja should be
available in `PATH`; missing host tools are reported in the final checklist.

With an extracted disc tree at `orig/GQNE5D`:

```sh
python3 tools/init.py
```

To validate a raw retail image explicitly:

```sh
python3 tools/init.py --iso "/path/to/Mortal Kombat - Deception.iso"
```

The initializer validates the `GQNE5D` ISO SHA-1, size, game ID, and embedded
`main.dol`; initializes submodules when present; fetches the pinned compiler and
matching tools into `build/`; runs `configure.py`; and performs the full Ninja
build.

Important: `--iso` validates an image but does not currently extract it. DTK's
split step still needs the matching extracted tree under `orig/GQNE5D`. DTK can
perform extraction manually. On a fresh checkout, the first initializer run may
end in `NOT READY` after downloading DTK; extract the image and rerun it:

```sh
build/tools/dtk disc extract "/path/to/game.iso" orig/GQNE5D
python3 tools/init.py --iso "/path/to/game.iso"
```

On native Windows, use `python` (or `py -3`) and
`build\tools\dtk.exe` with an appropriately quoted Windows ISO path.

Do not continue matching unless setup ends in `READY` and the build prints:

```text
build/GQNE5D/main.dol: OK
```

## Connect to DecompStudio

DecompStudio is the shared MCP coordinator at `http://127.0.0.1:7777/mcp`
(server name `core`, so Claude Code tools are `mcp__core__<tool>`). Call
`status` first: it returns your identity and the pinned brief.

- **Profiles hide tools.** The URL's `?profile=` decides which tools exist for
  your connection: `core` (default; no `permute`), `match` (slim worker; has
  `permute`, no `list_functions`/`spawn_identity`), `janitor` (match plus
  cleanup tools), `full` (everything, including `queue_work`, `review`,
  `wiki`, `sandbox_*`). Claude Code uses `full`; Codex uses `core`. If a tool
  is missing, it is the profile, not a bug; you cannot change it yourself.
- **Claude Code defers MCP tools.** Load schemas before calling, e.g.
  `ToolSearch "select:mcp__core__status,mcp__core__lease,mcp__core__try"`.
- **Separate processes** get their own identity automatically; set role in the
  URL (`?agent=janitor-1&profile=janitor&tier=2`, `kind=observer` for
  coordinators).
- **In-process sub-agents** share the parent's connection and act as the
  parent unless the parent calls `spawn_identity {count: N}` and gives each
  sub-agent one `session` id that it passes on **every** call. Children are
  tier 1 with the parent's profile; launch a separate process for anything
  else.

work queues): [docs/decomp/decompstudio.md](docs/decomp/decompstudio.md).

## Use the decomp books

Read [the conventions book](docs/decomp/conventiond.md) before reconstructing a
function. It describes high-level source shapes observed in game code, SDK code,
and bundled libraries. Use it to form a hypothesis, then confirm that hypothesis
against retail evidence.

For a localized mismatch, use the mechanical playbooks. They are tiered by how
rare the situation is; read tier 1 every time and open a deeper tier only when
its triage table points there:

1. [Core](docs/decomp/playbook-1-core.md) — protocol, acceptance gates,
   symptom-to-rule triage, the H-rule index, and stop rules. Start here.
2. [Common](docs/decomp/playbook-2-common.md) — detail for H01-H25: type, ABI,
   layout, lifetime, CFG, and register-coloring causes.
3. [Uncommon](docs/decomp/playbook-3-uncommon.md) — M01-M17: compiler modes,
   FP, aggregate/ABI shape, inline/macro boundaries, and data/link layout.
4. [Rare](docs/decomp/playbook-4-rare.md) — N01-N12, hard stops, compiler
   revisions, and permuter search.

Each rule has its own `## ID` section in tiers 2-4, so one rule can be read
alone (DecompStudio `docs` read with `section`). Rule IDs are stable across
tiers. Keep the tiers compact: amend the existing rule with its precondition,
action, and one exemplar symbol; put attempt history, scores, and campaign
evidence in linked reports. Preserve distinct preconditions, safety/stop
rules, and rule IDs when summarizing.

Each rule is an `IF / REQUIRE / TRY` diagnostic. Apply it only when its preconditions
match the assembly and call-site evidence. Try one mechanical edit, rebuild, and
measure. Never stack speculative tricks merely because one improves fuzzy score.
If only harmless register coloring remains, follow the tier-4 hard-stop
(soft-ceiling) rule and stop.

## Recover a function with m2c

DecompStudio's `m2c` tool (or `get_function {symbol, m2c: true}`) runs its
built-in m2c on the retail object, with the unit's preprocessed source as type
context. The repository no longer ships a Python m2c wrapper or checkout. Find
the function and its unit in `config/GQNE5D/symbols.txt` or `objdiff.json` when
the symbol is uncertain.

Use m2c to recover control flow, operations, and an initial type hypothesis.
Replace generated temporaries, unknown types, casts, and gotos with supported
project types and structured C. Keep a `goto` only under the last-resort
exception in the repository rules. Check inferred union members against retail
offsets, and check every call and store order against the retail assembly before
treating the reconstruction as source.

## Permute a localized near match

Use DecompStudio's permuter only after the algorithm, CFG, ABI, types, and
layout agree with retail evidence and objdiff classifies the function as a near
miss. It complements the ranked playbooks for localized scheduling, stack, and
register-allocation differences; it does not replace m2c, reconstruction, or
playbook diagnosis. It permutes the live source or a draft with the MKD
`playbook` profile, which favors honest staging, ordering, and operand passes
and disables dead-sink, padding, and `if (1)` passes. When argument staging or
register coloring around a call remains, use its call-argument mode to score
every staging combination (keep, fold `v op= e` into the argument, fold to the
value, or hoist into a local). The repository no longer ships the Python
decomp-permuter adapter or checkout.

Treat every generated candidate as a hypothesis. Reject undefined behavior,
fake `volatile`, invented lifetimes, incorrect types, or reordered side effects.
Apply only one understandable candidate insight to `src/`, rebuild the affected
object, and inspect the same symbol with objdiff. A permuter score of zero still
requires an honest-source review, the full build, and the retail SHA-1 gate. If
only harmless coloring remains, keep the tier-4 hard-stop soft ceiling instead
of landing permutation residue.

## Build and inspect the diff

After each coherent source edit, build the affected object when its Ninja path
is known:

```sh
ninja build/GQNE5D/src/UNIT.o
```

Run the full build before declaring completion:

```sh
ninja
```

Use the unit name recorded in `objdiff.json` to compare a function:

```sh
build/tools/objdiff-cli diff -p . -u main/UNIT SYMBOL -o - --format json-pretty
```

If the unit name is uncertain, search it rather than guessing:

```sh
rg -n '"name": "main/.*UNIT|"source_path": ".*UNIT' objdiff.json
```

Interpret the diff structurally:

- Wrong branches, calls, or large instruction islands: recover the algorithm or
  CFG before tuning declarations.
- Wrong load/store widths or offsets: fix types, signedness, or layout.
- Wrong argument registers: inspect callers and correct the prototype/order.
- Same operations with different nonvolatile registers: check honest lifetimes
  and declaration scope, then stop if only coloring remains.

## Other matching tools

### DTK

DTK validates and extracts images, splits the retail DOL, produces assembly, and
supports low-level DOL inspection:

```sh
build/tools/dtk disc info "/path/to/game.iso"
build/tools/dtk disc verify "/path/to/game.iso"
build/tools/dtk disc extract "/path/to/game.iso" orig/GQNE5D
build/tools/dtk dol info orig/GQNE5D/sys/main.dol
build/tools/dtk shasum -c config/GQNE5D/build.sha1
```

Normal split/report rules are generated by `configure.py` and run by Ninja. Do
not manually rewrite generated assembly or split outputs.

### CodeWarrior, sjiswrap, Wibo, and binutils

The initializer downloads the pinned CodeWarrior compiler bundle, `sjiswrap`,
GNU PowerPC binutils, and Wibo where required. Ninja selects them through the
generated build rules. Agents should change compiler flags only at the narrowest
supported object scope and must recheck every previously exact function in that
translation unit.

- `sjiswrap.exe` preserves the compiler's expected Shift-JIS input behavior.
- Wibo runs the Windows CodeWarrior executables on supported Unix hosts; native
  Windows runs them directly.
- PowerPC binutils assemble handwritten or generated assembly inputs used by the
  project. They are not a substitute for matching CodeWarrior-generated C/C++.

### Deferred-inline order

`python3 tools/deferred_scan.py` lists units whose retail parse-time symbols
number backwards through `.text`, which is the `-inline deferred` signature.
`python3 tools/reverse_deferred_tu.py IN.c OUT.c` writes a reversed-definition
candidate for a scratch compile. Follow the playbook's M15 deferred-order
addendum and land it only when the whole unit gains.

### Project configuration and progress

Regenerate build metadata after changing `configure.py`, splits, symbols, or
tool configuration:

```sh
python3 configure.py
```

Print the current matching totals:

```sh
python3 configure.py progress
```

The detailed generated report is `build/GQNE5D/report.json`.

## Self-validation checklist

Before reporting a decompilation change complete:

```sh
ninja
build/tools/dtk shasum -c config/GQNE5D/build.sha1
python3 configure.py progress
git diff --check
git status --short
```

Use `build\tools\dtk.exe` and `python`/`py -3` for the equivalent checks on
native Windows.

Also record the affected symbol's objdiff result before and after the change.
Confirm that declarations, callers, function order, object classification, and
shared layouts remain consistent. Report compiler warnings, soft ceilings, and
unrelated pre-existing changes honestly.
