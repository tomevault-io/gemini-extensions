mvn -pl safere test -q

# Install to local repo (needed before benchmarks)
mvn install -DskipTests -q

# Run benchmarks (see Benchmarking section below)
./run-java-benchmarks.sh '^org\.safere\.benchmark\.RegexBenchmark\.'
```

## Code Style

Follow the [Google Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html):

- 2-space indentation, no tabs
- 100-character line limit
- Braces on same line (`if (...) {`)
- One class per file (except private inner classes)
- `static` imports grouped separately, sorted alphabetically
- Non-static imports sorted alphabetically
- No wildcard imports
- Use `@Override` on all overriding methods
- Write Javadoc for all public and protected members
- Use `{@code ...}` in Javadoc for code fragments
- Prefer `Objects.requireNonNull` over explicit comparisons to `null` for
  validating required arguments and state, when appropriate.
- Fields: `camelCase`; constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`; classes: `PascalCase`

## Architecture

The processing pipeline mirrors RE2:

```
Pattern string → Parse → Simplify → Compile → Execute
                  ↓         ↓          ↓          ↓
               Regexp     Regexp      Prog     NFA/DFA
               (AST)    (simpler)  (bytecode)   (match)
```

### Key Internal Classes

- `Parser` — stack-based operator-precedence regex parser → `Regexp` AST
- `Simplifier` — AST simplification (character class folding, etc.)
- `Compiler` — Thompson NFA construction → `Prog` / `Inst` bytecode
- `Regexp` — AST node (operator + children)
- `CharClass` / `CharClassBuilder` — sorted Unicode code point ranges
- `Prog` / `Inst` — compiled bytecode program

### Execution Engines (in priority order)

1. **Fast paths** — literal `String.indexOf()`, character-class bitmap scan
2. **OnePass** — deterministic single-pass matcher for unambiguous patterns
3. **DFA** — lazy DFA with cached states (forward, reverse, anchored)
4. **BitState** — NFA with visited-state bitmap for small texts
5. **NFA** — Pike VM for arbitrarily large texts

Engine selection in `Matcher.doFind()`:
1. Literal fast path → `String.indexOf()`
2. Anchored OnePass → direct OnePass if `^` and OnePass-eligible
3. Prefix acceleration → skip to first literal/charclass prefix match
4. OnePass for small text → `searchUnanchored()` if text ≤ 256 chars
5. DFA sandwich → forward DFA, reverse DFA, anchored DFA for match bounds
6. BitState/NFA fallback → full search with capture extraction

### Public API

Drop-in replacements for `java.util.regex`:
- `Pattern` — compiled regex (replaces `java.util.regex.Pattern`)
- `Matcher` — match state (replaces `java.util.regex.Matcher`)
- `PatternSet` — multi-pattern matching (SafeRE-only feature)

## Testing

- Use JUnit 6 (6.0.3) with `org.junit.jupiter.api.*` imports
- Use AssertJ (`org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.*`) for all assertions
- Test class naming: `FooTest.java` for `Foo.java`
- Name regression test classes, nested classes, methods, and display names for
  the behavior under test, not the issue number. Do not use names like
  `Issue123RegressionTest`, `Issue123Regressions`, or
  `original issue #123 test case`.
- Keep issue references in comments, Javadocs, or display-name suffixes only
  when they add traceability. The issue number should never be the primary
  description of the test.
- Use `@Test`, `@ParameterizedTest`, `@DisplayName` as appropriate
- Aim for high coverage; JaCoCo is configured in the build
- Port test cases from RE2's C++ test suite where applicable
- For performance regressions, do not hardcode specific elapsed durations in
  tests. Test the performance behavior directly in a way that is stable across
  machines, such as relative ratios between related inputs or scaling behavior.
- **Do not include test counts in documentation** (DESIGN.md, TESTING.md,
  etc.) — counts change frequently as tests are added and will go stale.
- When updating BENCHMARKS.md, include the full Git SHA that the benchmarks
  were run against and that commit's date/time in UTC using `Z` notation
  (for example, `2026-04-27T02:42:22Z`). Do not include a separate benchmark
  results timestamp unless explicitly requested.

## External Validation

When swapping SafeRE into external projects for validation (#26), **fix every
bug you find immediately**. Do not just report it and move on. The workflow is:

1. Identify the failure and root-cause it.
2. Write a regression test in SafeRE that reproduces the bug.
3. Fix the bug in SafeRE.
4. Run the SafeRE test suite to confirm the fix and no regressions.
5. Re-install (`mvn install -DskipTests -q`) and re-run the external
   project's failing tests to confirm they now pass.
6. Commit the fix.
7. Then continue with the rest of the validation.

## Pull Requests

- Before creating a PR, run best-effort focused validation for the change, such
  as tests likely to be affected by the touched code. Full SafeRE plus public
  API crosscheck validation is not required. The PR description must say
  exactly which verification has run and which verification has not run.
  Use `@DisabledForCrosscheck("reason")` on original SafeRE tests for cases
  that should be visible as disabled only in generated crosscheck coverage.
- **Update existing PRs — do not close and reopen.** Push commits (or
  force-push if rebasing) to the existing branch. Closing and reopening PRs
  loses review context and clutters the issue tracker.
- When creating or editing PR descriptions with `gh`, write the body to a
  temporary file first and pass it with `--body-file`. Do not inline
  multi-line Markdown in the shell command, because quoting and escaping are
  easy to get wrong.
- Include the appropriate issue linkage in the PR description as well as in
  commit messages: use `Fixes #N` only when the PR fully resolves the issue,
  and use `Refs #N` or `Part of #N` for partial work. GitHub's Development
  sidebar links open PRs to issues based on the PR description; commit-message
  keywords may only close the issue after merge as a commit reference.
- For performance optimization PRs, include before/after benchmark results in
  the PR description and state the measured improvement or regression for the
  specific change. Use the standard Java benchmark configuration by default;
  use `--long` when confirming close, surprising, or especially important
  comparisons.
- Do not push directly to `main`. Always create a branch and open a PR.
## GitHub Issues

- Do not close an issue until **all** items in it are resolved. If only some
  items are done, post a progress comment instead.
- When referencing an issue in a commit message, use `Fixes #N` only if the
  commit fully resolves the issue. Otherwise use `Refs #N` or `Part of #N`.
- When creating or commenting on issues with `gh`, write the body to a
  temporary file first and pass it with `--body-file`. Do not inline
  multi-line Markdown in the shell command, because quoting and escaping are
  easy to get wrong.
- **File issues for bugs found during other work.** If you discover a bug
  while working on an unrelated task, you *must* file a GitHub issue for it
  immediately. Do not silently work around it or leave it undocumented.

## Bug Fixing Philosophy

- **SafeRE/JDK divergence bugs**: Use the `divergence-bug-fix` skill for bugs
  where SafeRE behavior diverges from `java.util.regex`. It consolidates the
  compatibility policy, JDK 26 `Pattern`/`Matcher` Javadoc assessment,
  test-driven regression coverage, and fuzz coverage requirements.
- **Make principled fixes.** Understand the root cause before changing code.
  Do not add special cases, flags, or if-statements that paper over symptoms.
  A correct fix addresses the underlying design flaw — if a DFA cache key is
  missing a dimension, fix the cache key; don't add a post-hoc correction.
- **Do not make point fixes.** A fix must generalize to the semantic class of
  the bug, not just the specific repro, issue, fuzz seed, or benchmark case.
  Avoid pattern-string checks, input-shape checks, and other one-off guards
  unless they directly encode a documented regex/API rule.
- **Verify the invariant, not just the test.** After a fix, articulate *why*
  it is correct in general, not just why it makes a specific test pass.  If
  you can construct a new input that would still break, the fix is wrong.
- **Prefer fewer moving parts.** A fix that removes a special case is better
  than one that adds a new special case.  Simpler code has fewer bugs.
- **Test-driven bug fixing.** When fixing a bug, focus on test coverage
  *first*, before investigating the underlying code.  Do not look at the
  engine internals or try to understand why the code gets the wrong answer
  until tests are in place.  The workflow is:
  1. Ask: why isn't there test coverage for this *class* of things?
  2. Write systematic tests for the entire class of related behavior — not
     just the one failing case.
  3. Run the tests.  See which pass and which fail.
  4. *Then* investigate the code, root-cause the bug, and fix it.
  This catches other latent bugs in the same area and prevents regressions.

## Key Constraints

- **JDK compatibility**: SafeRE aims to be a drop-in replacement for
  `java.util.regex`, subject first to SafeRE's linear-time guarantee. Never
  choose JDK specification compliance or observed JDK behavior compatibility
  when doing so would violate the linear-time guarantee. Within that
  constraint, comply with the official JDK Javadoc specification. If the
  specification is ambiguous or unspecified, match observed JDK behavior when
  doing so preserves linear time. If observed JDK behavior contradicts the
  specification, stop and explain the contradiction to the project owner; if
  they confirm proceeding, match the specification subject to linear time and
  document the intentional divergence from observed JDK behavior.
- **Compatibility must be engine-native or bounded.** JDK compatibility code
  may add explicit dimensions to engine state, use bounded per-input context,
  or perform a bounded number of linear passes over the relevant input range.
  It must not repair engine results by repeatedly invoking matchers, replaying
  prefixes, rescanning unbounded context from many positions, or otherwise
  nesting input-position work inside retry loops. If matching observed JDK
  behavior appears to require that shape, stop and treat it as a compatibility
  boundary: either find an engine-native linear formulation, or document an
  intentional divergence under the linear-time guarantee.
- **Linear time**: No backreferences, no lookahead/lookbehind, no possessive
  quantifiers. These features violate linear-time guarantees and must be
  rejected at parse time with a clear error.
- **Unicode**: Operate on Unicode code points (not UTF-16 code units). Use
  `Character.codePointAt()` and related methods.
- **Stack safety**: Avoid recursion in SafeRE implementation code. Regex AST
  walks, program graph walks, parser logic, compiler logic, matcher execution,
  Unicode/class processing, and public API paths must use explicit
  stacks/worklists or existing iterative Walker helpers. Deeply nested regexes
  and large inputs must not be able to cause `StackOverflowError`. Recursion is
  acceptable only for test helpers or implementation details with a clearly
  static, small bound.
- **No `\C`**: RE2's "match any byte" is not applicable to Java strings.
- **No `@SuppressWarnings`**: Do not add `@SuppressWarnings` annotations
  without explicit approval from the project owner. Fix the underlying
  issue instead.
- **Avoid `Object` arrays**: Use typed collections (`List<T>`, etc.) instead
  of `Object[]` to maintain type safety. Primitive arrays (e.g., `int[]`)
  are fine for performance reasons.
- **No installing software**: Never install packages, libraries, or tools
  on the machine. If something is missing, ask the project owner to install
  it.
- **Not a clean-room port**: SafeRE is a port of RE2, using the C++ RE2
  source as a reference. Never describe it as a "clean-room" port.
- **No personal names in documentation**: Refer to projects (RE2, RE2/J)
  rather than individuals. Do not mention people's names in DESIGN.md,
  README.md, TESTING.md, or other documentation.
- **Regression tests for bugs**: Any time a bug is found, a regression test
  must be added that fails without the fix and passes with it.

## Benchmarking

### Running Benchmarks

**Always use `./run-java-benchmarks.sh`** to run benchmarks. This script
runs `mvn install` to build a shaded (fat) JAR, then runs it with
`java -jar`. This is required for JMH fork mode — forked JVMs need a
self-contained classpath. Do NOT use `mvn exec:java`, which breaks fork
mode because the forked child cannot find JMH classes.

The script is the **single source of truth** for benchmark settings.
Benchmark classes have no `@Fork`, `@Warmup`, or `@Measurement` annotations
— all statistical rigor settings are controlled by the script.

```bash
# BENCHMARKS.md updates and routine benchmark evidence
./run-java-benchmarks.sh '^org\.safere\.benchmark\.RegexBenchmark\.'

# Longer confirmation run for close, surprising, or important comparisons
./run-java-benchmarks.sh --long '^org\.safere\.benchmark\.RegexBenchmark\.'
```

Arguments after the mode flag are passed directly to JMH as benchmark regex
filters.

**Run benchmarks in batches, not all at once.** Run 2–3 benchmark classes
per invocation and collect results incrementally:

```bash
./run-java-benchmarks.sh \
  '^org\.safere\.benchmark\.RegexBenchmark\.' \
  '^org\.safere\.benchmark\.CompileBenchmark\.'
./run-java-benchmarks.sh \
  '^org\.safere\.benchmark\.SearchScalingBenchmark\.' \
  '^org\.safere\.benchmark\.CaptureScalingBenchmark\.'
./run-java-benchmarks.sh \
  '^org\.safere\.benchmark\.HttpBenchmark\.' \
  '^org\.safere\.benchmark\.ReplaceBenchmark\.' \
  '^org\.safere\.benchmark\.FanoutBenchmark\.'
./run-java-benchmarks.sh \
  '^org\.safere\.benchmark\.PathologicalBenchmark\.' \
  '^org\.safere\.benchmark\.PathologicalComparisonBenchmark\.'
```

**Extract summary tables from JMH output** using grep:

```bash
./run-java-benchmarks.sh '^org\.safere\.benchmark\.RegexBenchmark\.' 2>&1 \
  | grep -E '^(Benchmark|[A-Z][a-zA-Z]+Benchmark\.)'
```

### Key Rules

- **The default run is the standard Java benchmark configuration.** Running the
  script without mode flags uses 2 forks, 2 warmup × 500ms, and 5 measurement
  × 500ms. This empirically selected configuration is the default for routine
  benchmark evidence and BENCHMARKS.md updates.
- **Use `--long` for confirmation.** Long mode uses 2 forks, 3 warmup × 1s,
  and 5 measurement × 1s. Use it for close, surprising, or especially important
  comparisons where the extra runtime is justified.
- **Pathological benchmarks always use `-f 0`.** The script handles this
  automatically — PathologicalBenchmark and PathologicalComparisonBenchmark
  run without forking because the JDK engine can hang on large inputs.
- **Default benchmark collection is Java-only.** `./collect-benchmark-results.sh`
  collects SafeRE, JDK, RE2/J, and RE2-FFM results by default. Use
  `./collect-benchmark-results.sh --cross-language` only when broader C++ RE2
  and Go `regexp` context is explicitly needed.
- **NEVER run benchmarks in parallel.** All benchmark runs must run
  sequentially, one at a time. Parallel runs compete for CPU, cache, and memory
  bandwidth, producing inaccurate results.
- **Do not commit optimizations that do not improve benchmark results.**
  Every optimization must be validated with before/after benchmarks.
- **All harnesses share `benchmark-data.json`.** This ensures identical
  patterns, inputs, and parameters across Java, C++, and Go. Edit the
  JSON file to change workloads; never hardcode values in the harness.

### Summary Statistics

When reporting benchmark results in BENCHMARKS.md, always compute and report
**geometric mean of the speed ratios** (SafeRE time / competitor time) as the
single summary statistic. Report three geomeans, against JDK, RE2/J, and
RE2-FFM:

1. **Core workloads geomean** — includes: literalMatch, emailFind, findInText,
   alternationFind, charClassMatch, captureGroups, pigLatinReplace, and
   httpFull. These are focused microbenchmarks that isolate engine behavior.
2. **Application workloads geomean** — includes the data-driven validation,
   parsing, extraction, scanning, and redaction cases from
   `ApplicationBenchmark`. This answers: "Is SafeRE competitive on ordinary
   application regex use?"
3. **Pathological/scaling geomean** — includes: pathological, searchHardFail,
   and other benchmarks that demonstrate linear-time guarantees or scaling
   behavior. This answers: "Does the linear-time guarantee matter?"

**Why geometric mean:** It is the only mean consistent under inversion
(geomean(A/B) = 1/geomean(B/A)), treats multiplicative improvements
symmetrically, and is the standard in systems benchmarking (SPEC, DaCapo,
Renaissance). Do not use arithmetic mean of ratios — it is biased by outliers
and inconsistent under inversion.

**Ratio convention:** Express as `SafeRE / competitor` so values < 1.0 mean
SafeRE is faster. For readability, also express as "SafeRE is N× faster" or
"SafeRE is N× slower" alongside the raw geomean.

### Writing About Benchmark Results

- **Use professional, neutral language.** Do not use terms like "crushes",
  "destroys", "demolishes", or other language that puts down other
  implementations. Every engine makes deliberate design tradeoffs.
- **State facts and ratios.** Write "SafeRE is 50× faster than RE2/J"
  rather than "SafeRE crushes RE2/J."
- **Explain *why* differences exist.** Attribute performance gaps to
  specific design decisions (e.g., "RE2/J lacks a DFA engine" or "JDK
  defers compilation work to match time") rather than implying one
  implementation is poorly written.
- **Acknowledge tradeoffs.** When SafeRE is slower, explain what it gains
  in return (e.g., linear-time guarantees). When it's faster, note what
  the other engine optimizes for instead.

## Profiling

Use profiling to identify actual bottlenecks before implementing optimizations.
**Do not guess** — profile first, optimize second.

### async-profiler

[async-profiler](https://github.com/jvm-profiling-tools/async-profiler) 4.3 is
installed and on the PATH (`asprof`). It supports CPU, allocation, and lock
profiling with minimal overhead and no safepoint bias.

**CPU flame graph** — identifies where CPU time is spent:

```bash
# Attach to a running JVM by PID
asprof collect -d 30 -e cpu -o flamegraph -f /tmp/cpu-flame.html <pid>

# Or use the JVM agent to profile from start (no PID needed):
java -agentpath:/home/eaftan/async-profiler-4.3-linux-x64/lib/libasyncProfiler.so=start,event=cpu,file=/tmp/cpu-flame.html \
  -jar safere-benchmarks/target/benchmarks.jar <BenchmarkClass> -f 0 -wi 1 -i 3 -w 1 -r 1
```

**Allocation profiling** — identifies where objects are allocated:

```bash
asprof collect -d 30 -e alloc -o flamegraph -f /tmp/alloc-flame.html <pid>
```

**Flat output** — top methods by sample count (quick text summary):

```bash
asprof collect -d 30 -e cpu -o flat -f /tmp/cpu-flat.txt <pid>
```

**Filtering to SafeRE code** — use `-I` to include only relevant frames:

```bash
asprof collect -d 30 -e cpu -o flat -I 'org.safere.*' -f /tmp/safere-cpu.txt <pid>
```

**Tips:**
- Always pass `-XX:+UnlockDiagnosticVMOptions -XX:+DebugNonSafepoints` to the
  JVM for accurate line-level profiling. Without these flags, samples are biased
  toward safepoints.
- For profiling JMH benchmarks, use `-f 0` (no-fork mode) so async-profiler can
  attach to the same JVM. Fork mode spawns child JVMs that need separate
  attachment.
- Profile for at least 10–30 seconds to get statistically meaningful samples.
- Use `-t` (threads) to see per-thread breakdown.

### Java Flight Recorder (JFR)

JFR is built into OpenJDK 25 and always available. It's best for allocation
profiling and event-based analysis.

**Record to file:**

```bash
java -XX:StartFlightRecording=duration=30s,filename=/tmp/recording.jfr \
  -jar safere-benchmarks/target/benchmarks.jar <BenchmarkClass> -f 0 -wi 1 -i 3 -w 1 -r 1
```

**Attach to running JVM:**

```bash
jcmd <pid> JFR.start name=profile duration=30s filename=/tmp/recording.jfr
```

**Analyze JFR files** — use `jfr` CLI tool for text summaries:

```bash
jfr summary /tmp/recording.jfr
jfr print --events jdk.ObjectAllocationInNewTLAB /tmp/recording.jfr | head -100
jfr print --events jdk.ExecutionSample /tmp/recording.jfr | head -100
```

**Tips:**
- JFR has lower overhead than async-profiler for allocation tracking.
- async-profiler is preferred for CPU profiling (no safepoint bias).
- JFR `.jfr` files can also be opened in JDK Mission Control for visual
  analysis (not available on this machine, but files can be downloaded).
