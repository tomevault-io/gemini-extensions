## Python Pipeline Workflow

Current priority is productionizing the morning enrichment pipeline in `scripts/`.

Order of work:
1. Fix entity parsing and non-human owner handling.
2. Add contact lookup dedupe/cache so repeated principals do not burn PDL credits.
3. Make SC SOS LLC resolution more deterministic before company-level PDL fallback.
4. Improve transaction/mortgage property-address extraction quality.
5. Only address evidence URL quality after output data is trustworthy.

Current status:
- Step 1 completed: non-human owners like "City of Greenville" no longer become fake people such as "Of City".
- Step 2 completed: contact enrichment now reuses existing `enriched_leads` contact info by normalized principal/entity, caches newly found contacts within the run, and caches negative no-match / no-contact person and company lookup results so repeated principals/entities do not keep hitting Apollo/PDL in the same run.
- Step 3 completed: SC SOS detail pages are now scored against the target LLC name before principal extraction, near-match entity variants are rejected, and only accepted SOS matches are allowed to short-circuit before company-level PDL fallback.
- Step 4 completed: property-address extraction now uses shared scored address parsing across GovOS detail HTML and mortgage OCR text, prefers labeled/property-context candidates, and rejects footer/party metadata false positives.
- Step 5 completed: evidence URLs are now normalized and ranked so enriched leads prefer concrete detail/article/document pages, and low-signal placeholders like search-query strings or login/disclaimer pages are no longer saved.
- Principal-quality validation completed: `principal_name` values are now screened before person-level contact enrichment so obvious junk labels, malformed token-order values, address-like strings, digit-heavy strings, and non-human entities are suppressed before Apollo/PDL person lookup.
- Historical repair/backfill pass completed: `scripts/enrich.py` now supports `--repair-stale` to re-run the current enrichment chain plus current contact gating/cache logic against stale `enriched_leads` rows, prioritizing legacy rows with no `enrichment_version`, rows with older `enrichment_version` values, and rows whose stored `principal_name` now fails current quality checks.
- Historical repair/backfill validation completed: dry-run validation against Supabase confirmed the stale-row selector was too chronological, so `--repair-stale` now scans a wider window and ranks obvious junk principals / stale pending rows ahead of generic legacy rows.
- Windows CLI compatibility completed: repair runs no longer die on `cp1252` console encoding because runtime status output in the enrichment scripts was normalized to ASCII.
- GIS owner normalization fix completed: GIS owner rows that still match the target entity are now preserved as non-human entities instead of being normalized into fake people such as `"Crafted Carolina"` or `"Ten Focus"` during stale repair.
- Mortgage credential loading fix completed: `scripts/enrich.py` now loads `.env.local` before importing `enrich_mort`, and `scripts/enrich_mort.py` now resolves `ROD_VIEWER_USERNAME` / `ROD_PASSWORD` at lookup time instead of freezing env vars at module import.
- Mortgage principal-quality gate completed: OCR-parsed signer labels such as `"Property Description"` and `"Legal Description"` are now rejected via shared `principal_name_quality_issue()` validation before mortgage results can short-circuit enrichment or mark a row enriched.
- Enrichment version bumped to `5`: `EnrichmentResult.is_enriched()` now requires a principal candidate to pass the shared quality gate, not just fail the non-human-owner check.
- Stale-repair selector fix completed: pending rows that legitimately retain a non-human entity principal are no longer re-queued forever just because `principal_name_quality_issue()` returns `non-human owner/entity`.
- Live repair validation completed: one row was successfully rewritten to version `5` in Supabase (`FOCUS TEN INVESTMENTS LLC`), and the stored row now remains `pending` with entity-level principal data instead of promoting junk mortgage OCR output to a fake human.
- Runtime note: full `python scripts/enrich.py --repair-stale` runs can take well over 20 minutes because each row may perform Playwright mortgage/GIS work plus multiple DuckDuckGo requests that can individually hit network timeouts.

Next step:
- Add a batch-size / limit control to `scripts/enrich.py --repair-stale` so live backfills can run in smaller chunks, then resume the live historical repair/backfill pass against Supabase and inspect the first chunked repaired rows.

Next productionization priorities:
1. Add a batch-size / limit control to `scripts/enrich.py --repair-stale`, then resume the live historical repair/backfill pass against Supabase and inspect the first chunked repaired rows.
2. Persist a more dashboard-ready lead shape: keep `entity_name`, `property_address`, and owner mailing/address fields separately instead of collapsing them into `location`.
3. Tighten event identity and dedupe keys so multiple deeds or mortgages for the same entity on the same recording date do not collapse into one row.
4. Add fixture-based regression tests for principal parsing, property-address extraction, and contact-enrichment gating/caching behavior.

Useful command:
- `python scripts/enrich.py --repair-stale --dry-run`
- `python -c "import os; from pathlib import Path; from dotenv import load_dotenv; load_dotenv(Path('.env.local')); print(bool(os.getenv('ROD_PASSWORD')))"`  

## Website Positioning Context

- Lead with `Company Brain` as the main offer.
- Position REBB as a focused setup/service for owner-led local service businesses, not a generalist marketing agency.
- Primary audience: Greenville / Upstate SC owner-led service businesses, especially 5-25 person HVAC, plumbing, electrical, roofing, GC, and similar teams where the owner is still the default source of truth.
- Core pain: the team repeatedly interrupts the owner for answers that already exist across email, notes, files, estimates, and job history.
- Core promise: REBB sets up a private Company Brain so the team can find answers without calling the owner first.
- Avoid presenting REBB as equal-parts SEO agency, web dev shop, lead gen agency, and AI consultancy.
- Avoid selling `LLC Owner Finder` as a polished product or clean dashboard until fulfillment is consistently reliable.
- Do not use vague `AI consulting` language; sell operational outcomes and concrete use cases instead.
- Keep CTA language aligned with the actual offer, e.g. `Book a Setup Call`, not `Get Dashboard Access` unless a real polished dashboard is the product being sold.
- Keep it framed as `beta`, `experimental`, or `early access`.
- It can appear lower on the homepage or on dedicated pages as an R&D / pilot initiative.
- The live feed component is better used as a lower-page beta proof element than as the hero centerpiece.
- Site status as of 2026-04-10: homepage, nav, footer, contact flow, metadata, `how-it-works`, `lead-intelligence`, and the old secondary service pages were rewritten to match this positioning.
