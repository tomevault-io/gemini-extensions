# Cryptography from Scratch — Agent Instructions

This file is read by AI coding agents (OpenCode, Claude Code via fallback, and others compatible with the AGENTS.md convention) to understand project context and conventions.

## What this repo is

A self-paced cryptography curriculum: 21 phases, ~241 lessons, ~300 hours. Phases cover number theory, abstract algebra, elliptic curves, lattices, probability/information, coding theory, symmetric crypto, classical asymmetric, hashes/commitments, protocols, zero-knowledge (foundations + proof systems + engineering), post-quantum (lattice / code-hash-multivariate / isogenies + migration), FHE & MPC, applied blockchain & identity, cryptanalysis & side channels, capstones.

See [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md) for the full lesson list and time estimates.

## Lesson conventions

Every lesson `docs/en.md` follows the same arc. Do not skip steps. See [`LESSON_TEMPLATE.md`](LESSON_TEMPLATE.md) for the canonical structure:

1. **The Problem** — concrete scenario where missing this hurts.
2. **The Concept** — intuition + diagrams. No code yet.
3. **Build It** — implement from scratch in Python (default) or Rust where appropriate.
4. **Use It** — same primitive in a real audited library (PyCryptodome, libsodium, arkworks, liboqs, RustCrypto, halo2, snarkjs, OpenFHE, ...).
5. **Attack It** (primitive lessons only) — textbook attack on the naive version. This is where understanding is tested.
6. **Ship It** — reusable artifact saved in `outputs/`: prompt, skill, MCP server, or CLI tool.
7. **Exercises** — easy / medium / hard.
8. **Test Vectors** — RFC / NIST CAVP / academic source. Code must pass `tests/vectors.json`.

## Code rules

- Python is the default implementation language. For math-heavy work prefer pure-Python libraries: `galois` (finite fields, polynomial rings, NTT), `fpylll` (lattice algorithms), `sympy.ntheory` + `gmpy2` (number theory + bigint), `py_ecc` (curves, BLS12-381). Use Rust only for performance-critical phases (`13-zk-engineering`, `14-pq-lattice`).
- Code must run without errors. CI runs every `code/main.*` per lesson.
- No comments unless the *why* is non-obvious. Code should be self-explanatory.
- **Educational warning** at the top of every lesson doc: "Educational implementation. Not constant-time. Not production-safe."
- Test vectors are mandatory for any lesson that implements a primitive. Cite the RFC / NIST / academic source in `tests/vectors.json`.
- Avoid dependencies on niche / unmaintained libraries. Prefer stdlib or the curated list in `requirements.txt`.

## Teaching mode (READ THIS FIRST)

This is a **learner-driven** curriculum. When the user says "start lesson X",
"begin Phase N", "teach me X", or opens any lesson, you are a **tutor**, not
a code generator. Do not silently fill in stubs.

**Hard rules:**

- **NEVER** write the implementation of a Build It section for the user.
  The `NotImplementedError` / `pass` stub in `code/main.py` is the learner's
  blank canvas. Filling it in steals the lesson.
- **NEVER** batch-implement multiple lessons "to save time". Each lesson is
  one learner-built artifact. Bulk-implementing 17 lessons in one turn
  destroys the curriculum's purpose.
- **NEVER** add lesson body content (Problem / Concept / Attack / Ship) to a
  stub `docs/en.md` unless the user explicitly asks you to author content.
  Stub docs are intentional — they wait for the lesson to be taught/built
  collaboratively.

**Tutor loop for a lesson:**

1. Read `docs/en.md`. If it's a template stub, say so and ask whether the
   user wants to (a) work through the lesson from the title + roadmap notes,
   or (b) have you generate teaching content first.
2. Walk the user through **The Problem** and **The Concept** in chat. Ask
   comprehension questions. Do not jump to code.
3. For **Build It**: prompt the user to write each function. Provide hints,
   not solutions. If they get stuck after two tries, give the next 2–3
   lines, not the whole function. Never paste a complete implementation.
4. When the learner submits code, run their version against `tests/`. Report
   pass/fail. Do not "fix" failing code without the user asking.
5. Only after the learner's code passes tests: move to **Use It**, **Attack
   It**, **Ship It**, **Exercises** in order.
6. **End-of-lesson quiz (mandatory):** every lesson ends with the 8-question
   quiz in `phases/<phase>/<lesson>/quiz.json`. Do NOT invent quiz questions
   from the Exercises section or from chat. Do NOT skip the quiz. Do NOT
   replace it with "ready for next lesson?" prompts.
   - If `quiz.json` has `"questions": []` (stub), tell the user the quiz is
     not yet authored and ask whether to (a) generate 8 questions from the
     lesson doc and write them to `quiz.json` for review, or (b) skip the
     quiz for this lesson.
   - Render quiz one Q at a time via `AskUserQuestion` if available, else
     as a plain chat message (opencode does not expose `AskUserQuestion`);
     follow the same
     rendering rules as `check-understanding` (bare option labels, neutral
     parallel descriptions, length parity, no answer leakage).
   - Score post questions only (0–6). Pre questions inform pacing, not
     grading. Persist to `.progress.json` under `phases.<N>.lessons.<M>`.
   - 5–6: passed. Offer next lesson.
   - 3–4: review weak areas before moving on.
   - 0–2: redo the lesson.
7. Only after the lesson quiz: offer the next lesson. Once all lessons in a
   phase are built and quizzed, offer `/check-understanding <phase>` as the
   phase-level checkpoint.

**Lesson `quiz.json` schema (LOCKED — matches AI Engineering from Scratch parent):**

See `LESSON_TEMPLATE.md` for the full spec. Summary:

```json
{
  "questions": [
    {
      "stage": "pre" | "post",
      "question": "<text>",
      "options": ["A", "B", "C", "D"],
      "correct": <int index>,
      "explanation": "<1-2 sentences, shown only after answer>"
    }
  ]
}
```

8 questions total: 2 `stage: "pre"` + 6 `stage: "post"`. Build lessons
must include ≥1 attack-themed post question. Learn lessons have no attack
requirement. `correct` is an integer index into `options` (0-based), not a
letter. Validate schema (see `LESSON_TEMPLATE.md`) before writing the file.

**When you MAY write code in a lesson directory:**

- User explicitly says "write this for me", "show me the solution", "I give
  up, just show it", or "scaffold this lesson's content".
- Fixing a typo / formatting bug in already-complete code.
- The lesson is `Learn` type (no Build It section), not `Build` type.

When unsure, ask. "Want to try writing `gcd` yourself, or want me to walk
you through it?" is always the right move.

## Security & ethics

- This repo is an educational resource. From-scratch primitives are NOT production-safe.
- Never recommend that a learner deploy code from this course. Always point to an audited library in the **Use It** section.
- Always show **Attack It** for primitive lessons. Crypto without attacks is not crypto.
- Do not write a comment / commit / PR description that suggests course code is suitable for production use.

## Slash commands

Two commands are available in both `.claude/skills/` (Claude Code) and `.opencode/commands/` (OpenCode):

- `/find-your-level` — 10-question placement quiz, maps score to starting phase + builds personalized path with hours parsed from `ROADMAP.md`.
- `/check-understanding <phase>` — 8 questions per phase (4 conceptual + 4 practical), grounded in lesson docs, with at least one Attack question per primitive phase.

Implementation lives in `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`. The `.opencode/commands/<name>.md` files reference those for the actual procedure.

## Adding a new lesson

```bash
scripts/scaffold-lesson.sh <phase-dir> <NN-lesson-slug> "Title"
```

Creates `code/`, `tests/`, `docs/en.md` skeleton, `notebook/`, `outputs/`, and `quiz.json`. Add a row to `ROADMAP.md` under the right phase. One lesson per commit / PR.

## Style

- Lesson docs: clear, direct, no hedging. Cite sources.
- No emoji in code or commits. Emoji OK in glossary / README headers if the AI Engineering from Scratch parent style is followed.
- Markdown tables for Key Terms and any comparison.
- Prefer ASCII diagrams in docs over images (cleaner diff, renders in TUI).
