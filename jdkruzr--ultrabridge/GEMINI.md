# Boox Pipeline

Shutdown mid-job now leaves the row `in_progress` for the startup reclaim instead of marking a good note failed. `Processor` also gained `Running()` and idempotent Start/Stop with a per-Start `done` channel — it previously panicked on a stop/start/stop cycle.)

## Purpose
Processing pipeline for Boox notes. Orchestrates parse → render → OCR → index → embed workflow
for .note files uploaded via WebDAV, triggered by file uploads.

## Contracts
- **Exposes**: `Store` (UpsertNote, EnqueueJob, ClaimNextJob, CompleteJob, FailJob, RequeueJob, GetNote, ReclaimStuckJobs, RetryAllFailed, DeleteNote, SkipNote, UnskipNote, GetQueueStatus, ListNotesWithPrefix, UpdateNotePath, ReclaimAllInProgress), `BooxNote` and `BooxJob` models, `Processor` interface (Start, Stop, Running, Enqueue), `WorkerConfig` with Indexer, ContentDeleter, OCR interfaces, and embedding interfaces (Embedder, EmbedStore from rag package), `Importer` (ScanAndEnqueue, MigrateImportedFiles) with `ImportConfig` and `ImportResult` types.
- **Guarantees**: Atomic job claiming via SQLite RETURNING. Watchdog reclaims stuck jobs (>10 min in_progress). Graceful shutdown waits for current job, and leaves it `in_progress` so the next Start reclaims it rather than failing it. Content deletion uses ContentDeleter interface to ensure FTS5 triggers fire. Embedding failures are best-effort (logged, do not fail the job). OCR failures DO fail the job (`worker.go` returns `ocr page N: %w`) — they are then classified transient/permanent per the Invariants below.
- **Expects**: SQLite `*sql.DB` with `boox_notes` and `boox_jobs` tables (created by notedb schema migrations). `WorkerConfig` with Indexer, ContentDeleter, and optional OCR, Embedder, EmbedStore.

## Dependencies
- **Uses**: `notedb` schema (boox_notes, boox_jobs tables), `booxnote` (ZIP parser), `booxrender` (page renderer), `processor.Indexer` interface (shared with Supernote processor), optional `processor.OCRClient` (vision API), `search.Store.Delete()` for content deletion, `rag` package (Embedder and EmbedStore interfaces for embedding text)
- **Used by**: `cmd/ultrabridge` (wiring in main), `webdav` handler (Enqueue callback on upload), `web` handler (bulk import and management routes via BooxImporter interface)
- **Boundary**: Does not own file discovery — WebDAV handler passes paths directly. Importer owns bulk discovery from a configured import path. Does not implement Embedder or EmbedStore — those come from `rag` package.

## Key Decisions
- Separate from Supernote processor: Boox notes use different parser/renderer (booxnote/booxrender vs go-sn for .note files; pdftoppm via pdfrender for .pdf files), no RECOGNTEXT injection, different storage format
- PDF support: worker dispatches by file extension — .note files go through booxnote+booxrender, .pdf files go through pdfrender (renderPDFPageScaled with DPI scaling); both paths produce JPEG pages fed into the same OCR+index flow
- Shared Indexer: uses same `processor.Indexer` interface and note_content/note_fts tables as Supernote for unified search
- Atomic job claiming: SQLite RETURNING clause (SQLite 3.35+) for single-statement claim, avoiding race conditions
- Content deletion via interface: `ContentDeleter` allows search.Store to maintain FTS5 triggers on re-process
- Cache lifecycle: old cached JPEGs removed on re-process via `os.RemoveAll` before new renders
- OCR source tracking: "api" if OCR enabled, empty string if OCR disabled (no "myScript" equivalent for Boox)
- resolveMetadata preserves importer-provided metadata (title, author, etc.) when present; only falls back to WebDAV path extraction for files whose path is under the WebDAV root and that have no importer-supplied metadata
- Embedding integration: OCR'd text is embedded via Embedder interface and stored via EmbedStore interface (both from `rag` package). Embedding failures are logged but do not fail the job; allows OCR to proceed if embedding is unavailable.

## Invariants
- Job statuses: pending -> in_progress -> done|failed|skipped (or back to pending via
  ReclaimStuckJobs, or via RequeueJob after a transient failure)
- A transient OCR failure (see `processor.TransientError`) is requeued, not failed:
  `RequeueJob` sets status=pending plus a future `requeue_after`, which ClaimNextJob
  honours. Backoff doubles from 1 min, capped at 30 min, and the job fails terminally
  once `attempts` reaches `maxJobAttempts` (5). Permanent failures — 4xx, parse errors —
  fail on the first attempt. Without this, one momentary OCR-backend outage stranded a
  note in `failed` until a human pressed Retry Failed.
- boox_notes.path is PRIMARY KEY (absolute filesystem path)
- boox_jobs.note_path has FK to boox_notes.path — note row must exist before job insert
- EnqueueJob auto-creates minimal boox_notes row (INSERT OR IGNORE) to satisfy FK before worker parses metadata
- Version incremented on UpsertNote conflict (second call for same path increments version)
- ReclaimStuckJobs only operates on in_progress jobs (prevents status regression)
- ReclaimAllInProgress resets all in_progress jobs to pending (used on startup to recover after unclean shutdown)
- RetryAllFailed resets all failed jobs to pending; returns count of rows affected
- DeleteNote removes the boox_notes row, all boox_jobs rows for that path, the FTS5 content index entry, and the rendered JPEG cache directory
- SkipNote / UnskipNote operate on the most recent pending/skipped job for a given note path
- ListNotesWithPrefix filters boox_notes by path prefix (used by importer to detect already-imported files)
- UpdateNotePath renames a note's primary key and updates all FK references in boox_jobs (used by migrate.go after file copy)
- Worker polls every 5s when queue is empty; watchdog runs every 1 minute

## Key Files

- `store.go` — SQLite CRUD: UpsertNote, EnqueueJob, ClaimNextJob, CompleteJob, FailJob, GetNote, ReclaimStuckJobs, RetryAllFailed, DeleteNote, SkipNote, UnskipNote, GetQueueStatus, ListNotesWithPrefix, UpdateNotePath, ReclaimAllInProgress
- `worker.go` — job dispatch loop; dispatches by file extension (.note via booxnote+booxrender, .pdf via pdfrender); watchdog goroutine for stuck jobs
- `processor.go` — Processor interface implementation: Start, Stop, Enqueue
- `importer.go` — `ScanAndEnqueue(ctx, ImportConfig) (ImportResult, error)`: walks import directory, discovers .note and .pdf files, calls ExtractImportMetadata, enqueues each. `ExtractImportMetadata` extracts title/author from filename or embedded metadata. `ImportConfig` holds source path and options; `ImportResult` holds counts of enqueued/skipped/failed files.
- `migrate.go` — `MigrateImportedFiles(ctx) error`: copies files that were imported from outside the Boox notes directory into the notes directory, then updates DB paths via UpdateNotePath

## Gotchas
- `Indexer` interface defined in processor package; `ContentDeleter` defined locally in worker.go (to avoid circular imports)
- Rendered pages cached to disk at `{CachePath}/{noteID}/page_{N}.jpg` (not in SQLite)
- boox_notes.updated_at uses millisecond UTC unix timestamps (consistent with notedb convention)
- boox_jobs timestamps use seconds (queued_at, started_at, finished_at for compatibility with watchdog timeout)
