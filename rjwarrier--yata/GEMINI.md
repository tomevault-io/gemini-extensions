# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project

YATA ("Yet Another Task App") — a Material 3 Expressive task manager for Android, built with Jetpack Compose, Room, and Hilt. Gradle root project name is `TodoExpressive` (legacy); package/app id is `com.mj.yata`. Two modules:
- `:app` — the phone app (`com.mj.yata`, minSdk 26, compileSdk/targetSdk 35).
- `:baselineprofile` — a `com.android.test` module that records the ART baseline profile packaged with the app.

## Commands

All commands run from the repo root using the Gradle wrapper (`./gradlew` on Bash, `gradlew.bat` on native Windows shells).

```bash
# Compile Kotlin only (fast correctness check, no packaging) — use this while iterating
./gradlew :app:compileDebugKotlin -q

# Full debug build
./gradlew :app:assembleDebug -q

# Install to a connected/emulated device
./gradlew :app:installDebug -q

# Unit tests (JVM, no device) — e.g. RecurrenceEvaluatorTest, NaturalLanguageParserTest
./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest
./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest --tests "com.mj.yata.RecurrenceEvaluatorTest"
./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest --tests "com.mj.yata.RecurrenceEvaluatorTest.testWeeklyRecurrence"

# Instrumented tests. DESTRUCTIVE — see the warning below; -PdisposableDevice is required, and the
# build refuses to run without it. Note `--tests` does NOT work here; that is Gradle's unit-test
# filter, and connectedAndroidTest takes a runner argument instead.
./gradlew :app:connectedDebugAndroidTest -PdisposableDevice   # whole suite
./gradlew :app:connectedDebugAndroidTest -PdisposableDevice -Pandroid.testInstrumentationRunnerArguments.class=com.mj.yata.data.local.db.AppDatabaseMigrationTest

# Compose UI smoke suite (launch, add, complete, tab switch, delete-undo)
./gradlew :app:connectedDebugAndroidTest -PdisposableDevice -Pandroid.testInstrumentationRunnerArguments.class=com.mj.yata.MainScreenSmokeTest

# Regenerate the baseline profile (needs a rooted/userdebug device or emulator, API 28+)
./gradlew :baselineprofile:generateBaselineProfile
```

After changing anything under `app/src/main/java`, the fast loop is `compileDebugKotlin` to catch errors, then `installDebug` before manually verifying in the UI. `MainScreenSmokeTest` covers only the core add/complete/delete paths, so anything beyond those still needs a manual pass on-device.

**Never run instrumented tests against the user's phone.** `connectedAndroidTest` is not read-only: it reinstalls the app, and the tests add, complete and delete real rows in whatever database is on the device. It also used to uninstall the app on completion, wiping the Room database and DataStore — which is exactly how a real day's data was destroyed on this project. Two guards now exist: `android.injected.androidTest.leaveApksInstalledAfterRun=true` in `gradle.properties` stops the uninstall, and a `doFirst` check in `app/build.gradle.kts` refuses the task without `-PdisposableDevice`. **Do not pass that flag on the user's device**, and don't work around either guard — they exist because the failure is silent until the data is gone. Emulator or a spare device only, and ask first.

More generally: confirm before any command that can remove the app or its data — `adb uninstall`, `pm clear`, `installDebug` over a different signing key, or anything that resets storage. The user's phone is their daily driver, not a test rig.

**Never drive the device to take screenshots.** Do not use `adb shell screencap`, `uiautomator dump`, `adb shell input tap/swipe/keyevent`, or any other means of navigating the running app to look at it. Build, install, and describe what changed — visual verification is the user's, and they will send a screenshot when they want one. This applies even when a UI change would obviously benefit from being seen.

## Changelog

`CHANGELOG.md` is maintained by hand, newest first, in Keep a Changelog format. **Any change a user
would notice goes under `[Unreleased]` in the same commit that makes it** — not batched up at
release time. Internal refactors, build plumbing and test-only work stay in the commit message
unless they change behaviour.

Releasing: rename `[Unreleased]` to the new version with a date and `versionCode`, open a fresh
empty `[Unreleased]` above it, add the compare/tag links at the bottom, then use that section
verbatim as the GitHub release notes (`gh release create <tag> <apk> --notes-file …`). The release
notes and the changelog should never be written twice.

## Architecture

**Layering:** `domain/model` (plain data classes, no Android/Room deps) → `data/local/db` (Room entities/DAOs) → `data/mapper` (Entity ⇄ domain model conversion) → `data/repository/YataRepositoryImpl` (implements `domain/repository/YataRepository`, exposes `Flow`s) → `ui/screen/main/MainViewModel` (single large ViewModel backing the whole app, exposes `StateFlow`s and imperative methods like `deleteTask`, `bulkDeleteTasks`, `toggleTaskDone`) → Compose screens under `ui/screen/*`. Screens read from `MainViewModel` (obtained via `hiltViewModel()`) rather than each having their own ViewModel — there is one ViewModel per app, not per screen. Heavier multi-step logic is injected into it as `domain/usecase/TaskOperations` and `domain/usecase/BackupOperations` rather than living inline.

**Database (Room, `data/local/db/AppDatabase.kt`):** currently at version 26 (24 added `tasks.seriesId` + index, linking a recurring task to its historical completed instances for the reliable streak in `RecurrenceEvaluator.computeStreak`; 25 added `tasks.archived`; 26 added `tasks.startDate`). Every schema change is a hand-written `Migration` object added to the `companion object` and registered in `di/DatabaseModule.kt`'s `.addMigrations(...)` call — there's no auto-migration. `fallbackToDestructiveMigrationOnDowngrade()` only fires on a genuine version *downgrade* (e.g. reinstalling an older APK); a missing forward migration throws instead of silently wiping data. When adding a column/table: bump the version in `@Database`, add a `MIGRATION_N_N1` object, register it in `DatabaseModule`, and add a migration test to `AppDatabaseMigrationTest`. Row-scoped booleans/soft-deletes follow existing conventions — e.g. `tasks.deletedAt` (non-null = in Trash, not hard-deleted) and `projects/lists.excludeFromToday`.

**Navigation:** single-Activity, `ui/navigation/AppNavigation.kt` defines routes (`Screen.kt`) over a `NavHost`. `Screen.Main` is a 5-tab shell (`MainScreen.kt` → `CustomBottomNav` with ids 0=Today, 1=Projects, 2=People, 3=Tags, 4=Upcoming, fixed regardless of which tabs are hidden by feature flags) with its own drawer, FAB, and — as of the delete-undo work — a shared `SnackbarHostState` at the `MainScreen` Scaffold level for cross-tab bulk actions. Detail screens (task/project/list/tag/person, search, settings, trash, archive, analytics, help/about, next-days, welcome) are separate top-level destinations, each usually with its own `Scaffold`/`SnackbarHostState` when they need one (see `SearchScreen.kt`). `Screen.HelpAbout` and `Screen.Settings` were split apart (help/about used to be a card inside Settings); `Screen.NextDays` is a standalone 10-day lookahead reachable from the drawer's Tools section. The drawer's secondary entries (Next 10 Days, Command palette, My Work, Focus Mode, Morning/Evening Review, Stale Nudges, Task Health) live under a collapsible "Tools" header in `MainScreen.kt`, collapsed by default with state kept via `rememberSaveable` — add new drawer-only surfaces there rather than growing the top-level drawer list.

**Feature flags:** People/Tags/Projects are optional and can be hidden entirely via `UserPreferences` (`peopleFeatureEnabledFlow`, `tagsFeatureEnabledFlow`, `projectsFeatureEnabledFlow`, backed by DataStore in `data/local/datastore/UserPreferences.kt`). Any new screen/tab/bulk-action surface touching these entities should gate on the corresponding `*FeatureEnabled` `StateFlow` from `MainViewModel`, matching existing tabs.

**Task list screens share structural patterns**, not a shared composable hierarchy — each of Today/Project/List/Tag/Person independently splits its tasks into "Pending"/"Completed" sections (header via `ui/widgets/TaskSectionHeader.kt`, hidden when empty or when completed tasks are toggled off) and independently wires an eye-icon `hideCompleted` toggle. `ui/widgets/DragDropReorderableColumn.kt` is the shared long-press drag-to-reorder `LazyColumn` used by screens with manual ordering (Project/List detail); it supports non-draggable `header`/`footer` `LazyListScope` slots (e.g. the Pending/Completed headers and the static Completed list) via a `headerItemCount` offset that keeps its internal drag index math in the same "global" index space as `LazyListState.layoutInfo`.

**Delete-with-undo pattern:** deleting a task (single, from `TaskDetailScreen`, or bulk, from Today/Upcoming/Search's multiselect toolbar) does not delete immediately — it shows a `Snackbar` with an Undo action and only calls the repository delete if the window elapses untouched. Go through `showUndoSnackbar(hostState, message, seconds)` in `ui/widgets/UndoSnackbar.kt` rather than calling `showSnackbar` directly: it returns `true` when Undo was tapped (so the caller must *not* perform the action). `SnackbarDuration` only offers Short/Long and neither is configurable, so the helper shows the snackbar as `Indefinite` and times it out with `withTimeoutOrNull`. The window is user-configurable (Settings → Sound & Feedback: 4/8/15s, default 4) and reaches composables as `LocalUndoWindowSeconds` (provided in `MainActivity` from `undoWindowSecondsFlow`); `DeleteUndoSnackbar.kt`'s countdown reads that same CompositionLocal so the visible number and the real deadline can't drift apart. The host picks the custom rendering by checking `data.visuals.actionLabel == UNDO_ACTION_LABEL` — that constant stays untranslated on purpose (it's never displayed, and localizing it would break the equality check in every non-English locale).

**Search (`ui/screen/search/SearchScreen.kt`):** the DAO query covers only live tasks, so the "Archived" / "Trash" filter chips are satisfied client-side — they union `viewModel.archivedTasks` / `deletedTasks` into the result set and filter them with the local `Task.matchesSearchText` helper (title, notes, assignee names, effective tags, subtask titles), since the SQL `LIKE` search excludes both. Anything that changes the search haystack has to change in both places to stay consistent.

**Start dates (deferral):** `Task.startDate` ("YYYY-MM-DD", nullable, DB 26) is the "not actionable before" mirror of `due`'s "not after". A task whose start date is in the future is *deferred*: filtered out of Today, but otherwise untouched — still in its project/list, still searchable, badged "Starts <date>" by `TaskRow`. Distinct from both Trash and Archive, and it needs no background job: the filter is evaluated against the current date on read, so a task un-defers itself when the day arrives. Test the predicate through `Task.isDeferredOn(today)` rather than comparing `startDate` inline — it compares ISO strings (lexicographic order matches chronological), treats completed tasks as never-deferred, and fails toward *visible* on a malformed value, since a task wrongly shown is a nuisance while one wrongly hidden is lost.

**Task capture (`ui/sheets/NewTaskSheet.kt`):** the sheet hands its collected fields to callers as a single `NewTaskDraft`, not as a positional parameter list — add new task fields to that data class, not to the lambda signature. It used to be 14 positional parameters destructured identically at 6 call sites, on the one method whose register allocation has already overflowed once (see the toolchain note below); each added parameter pushed it back toward the limit, and every call site had to change. `MainViewModel.addTask(draft)` is the single place a draft maps onto the domain model.

 `NaturalLanguageParser` output is surfaced as a "smart add understood this task as" preview card — a chip per detected field (due, time, repeat, reminder, priority, flag, project, list, tags, people), dismissible, with a manual pick always overriding the parse (the `*ManuallySet` flags). The Repeat panel's custom option opens `RecurrenceSheet` in a nested `ModalBottomSheet`. `QuickAddDialogActivity` (the widget entry point) mirrors the same preview but stands alone — it goes to the repository directly, not through `MainViewModel`.

**Error handling on write paths:** `MainViewModel` never calls `viewModelScope.launch` directly — every write goes through its private `safeLaunch`, which catches `Throwable` (rethrowing `CancellationException`), logs, and emits a `@StringRes` id to `ui/error/AppErrorBus`. Room throws for reasons that aren't bugs and can't be prevented at the call site (FK violation from a concurrently deleted row, full disk, `SQLiteDiskIOException`), and in a bare `launch` any of those reaches the thread's uncaught handler and kills the app mid-action. New ViewModel methods must use `safeLaunch`; note the lambda label is `return@safeLaunch`, not `return@launch`. `AppErrorBus` is a `@Singleton` rather than ViewModel state because `MainViewModel` is scoped to the Main nav entry while the failure can happen several destinations deep — `MainActivity` collects it into a `SnackbarHost` layered over the whole `NavHost`, so one collector covers every screen. `UserPreferences` applies the same principle to reads: all `dataStore.data` access goes through a private `prefsFlow` that catches `IOException` and emits `emptyPreferences()`, so a corrupt prefs file degrades to first-launch defaults instead of crashing every collector. Writes are deliberately left unwrapped so a failing write still surfaces to its caller.

**Home-screen widgets (Glance, `widget/`):** each widget (`YataAppWidget`, `SingleListWidget`, `QuickAddWidget`, `ProgressStatsWidget`, `UpcomingWidget`, `TeamOverdueWidget`) is instantiated directly by Android (`new SomeWidget()`), not through Hilt, so it can't get constructor injection — instead it reaches app dependencies via `WidgetEntryPoint`, a `@EntryPoint` Hilt interface exposing `repository()`/`userPreferences()`. `WidgetUpdater.notifyTasksChanged()` is the single hook called after any task write; it refreshes all placed widget instances via `WidgetRefresher` and debounces the cloud-backup upload. All six widgets share one configure Activity, `WidgetCustomizerConfigActivity` (`Theme.Yata.Transparent`), for corner radius / custom label / M3-colors toggle / opacity / accent-color override; Single List and Quick Add additionally get a source picker (list/project/tag) from the same screen. Each widget's `provideGlance` must explicitly read+apply every `WIDGET_*_KEY` it wants to support — the config screen doesn't know which keys a given widget type actually renders, so a widget that's supposed to honor a shared option but doesn't read it fails silently (this bit `TeamOverdueWidget` once; see `supportsM3Colors` in `WidgetCustomizerConfigActivity` for how an unsupported option gets hidden instead of silently ignored).

**Reminders/notifications (`notification/`):** `ReminderScheduler`/`TaskReminderScheduler` schedule via `AlarmManager`, delivered by `ReminderReceiver`; `BootReceiver` reschedules everything on device reboot; `NotificationActionReceiver` handles notification-inline actions (e.g. mark done) without opening the app. `DailyAgendaWorker` and `OverdueEscalationWorker` are WorkManager jobs (not `AlarmManager`) for, respectively, a daily agenda summary notification and escalating overdue-task nudges. Both are user-controllable (Settings → Notifications: a toggle each, plus a time picker for the agenda, default 07:30) and `YataApplication` reconciles them against preferences on every start; toggling reschedules/cancels immediately. `DailyAgendaWorker.schedule(hour, minute)` enqueues with `ExistingPeriodicWorkPolicy.UPDATE` — with `KEEP` the already-enqueued job wins and a time change silently never takes effect.

**Self-hosted sync and backup (`data/sync/`, `data/sftp/`, `data/ftp/`):** remote backups use the same JSON format as `JsonExporter`, encrypted with the configured passphrase and synced through the user's own SFTP/FTPS/FTP folder. `UnifiedBackupWorker` is the WorkManager job for scheduled/background backups. Independent of the local `Trash`/undo path — this is off-device redundancy, not soft-delete.

**Archiving:** Projects, Lists, People, and (since DB 25) individual **Tasks** each support archive (distinct from Trash's soft-delete) — a hide-without-deleting state with dedicated DAO-backed archive streams, surfaced via each entity's detail/list screens. Don't conflate with `deletedAt`/Trash; archived rows stay fully intact and excluded only from default listing queries (`searchTasksWithRelations` filters `archived = 0` as well as `deletedAt IS NULL`). Archived tasks get their own destination, `Screen.Archive` → `ui/screen/archive/ArchiveScreen.kt`, which splits them into shelved-active vs shelved-completed sections and unarchives with an undo snackbar. **Auto-archive** (Settings → Backup & Data: Off / 7 / 30 / 90 days, off by default) runs from `MainViewModel.init` alongside `purgeOldTrash`; the query deliberately skips rows with a null `completedAt` (tasks completed before that column existed — treating null as "very old" would swallow the whole completed history on first run) and only notifies widgets when it actually moved something.

**Tasker integration (`tasker/createtask/`):** exposes a "Create Task" Tasker plugin action (`com.joaomgcd:taskerpluginlibrary`) — `CreateTaskConfigActivity` is the Tasker-facing config UI, `CreateTaskRunner` executes the action against the repository directly (not through `MainViewModel`, since it runs outside the app's Activity).

**Theming:** `ui/theme/` implements M3 Expressive with a warm coral palette by default (see `design/README.md` / `design_handoff_yata/README.md` for the original design tokens/handoff — these HTML/JSX files are non-executable design references, not code to import from). Accent colors for lists/projects/tags/people are named `accentA`..`accentP` (plus a literal `"error"` for tags) resolved through `LocalYataAccents`, not raw `Color` values, so accent pickers (`ColorPicker`, `IconPicker` in `ui/widgets/`) work uniformly across entity types.

`ThemeMode` is `SYSTEM / LIGHT / DARK / AMOLED`. AMOLED is a dark *variant*, not a third state: it resolves dark and additionally flattens surfaces to true black (`YataTheme`'s `toAmoled`), so it still composes with dynamic color and custom seeds. It replaced a clock-based `SCHEDULED` mode (deleted along with `ThemeScheduleUtils` and its time pickers); a persisted `SCHEDULED` value no longer parses and falls back to `SYSTEM`. `WidgetTheme` resolves `ThemeMode` independently for home-screen widgets — AMOLED resolves dark there too but deliberately skips the true-black treatment, since a pure-black panel on the launcher wallpaper reads as a hole. Any new `ThemeMode` value must be handled in both places.

**Settings (`ui/screen/settings/SettingsScreen.kt`):** one long screen grouped as Profile, Appearance, Display, Navigation, Sound & Feedback, Task Defaults, Notifications, Features, Manage, Privacy, Backup, Cloud, Local, Help. Sections are built from the shared `SettingsSectionHeader` / `SettingsSectionCard` / `SettingsToggleRow` composables in that file — use them rather than re-copying a section's scaffolding. Task defaults that used to be hardcoded now live here and are read via `MainViewModel`: `defaultDueDate` (`DefaultDueDate.TODAY/TOMORROW/NONE`, resolved in `NewTaskSheet`), `defaultPriority`, `trashRetentionDays` (7/30/90/Forever — `0` means keep forever and skips `purgeOldTrash` entirely, and `TrashScreen`'s "days left" label reads the setting instead of asserting 30), `autoArchiveDays`, `undoWindowSeconds`, and the notification toggles. Persisted enum/priority values are validated on read in `UserPreferences` and fall back to the default rather than throwing.

**Localization (`res/values/strings.xml`):** English (`en-US`) is the source language, declared by `tools:locale="en"` on `<resources>` and by `res/resources.properties`' `unqualifiedResLocale`. The bulk extraction is **done** (337 → 0 in `c8af7f0`); `strings.xml` now holds ~280 strings and 7 plurals. Run `./gradlew :app:lintHardcodedStrings` for the current count ranked by file — but treat it as a floor, not a total: its pattern misses literals written as a `text =` parameter inside a multi-line `Text(` call, and UI polish since then has reintroduced some (`NewTaskSheet`'s smart-add preview, `ArchiveScreen`'s section headers and unarchive snackbar, `TrashScreen.deletedLabel`) that the report does not flag. New UI text must go through `stringResource`/`pluralStringResource` (or `context.getString` outside composables), never a literal.

Naming: `action_*` (buttons/menu labels), `cd_*` (contentDescription), `<screen>_*` (screen-specific). Reuse the shared `action_*`/`cd_*` entries instead of adding a per-screen copy of a common word. Anything with a count uses `<plurals>` rather than string concatenation, and interpolated values use positional args (`%1$s`) so translators can reorder them.

Adding a language is only: create `res/values-<code>/strings.xml`, translate the values (never the `name` attributes). `androidResources.generateLocaleConfig = true` regenerates the locale config from whichever folders exist and injects `android:localeConfig` into the merged manifest, so the language appears in Android 13+'s per-app language picker with no list to update by hand. Missing keys fall back to English, and lint's `MissingTranslation` reports them once a second locale exists.

Debug builds enable `isPseudoLocalesEnabled`, adding **en-XA** (accented/padded — anything still rendering plain English is hardcoded, and clipped layouts won't survive a longer language) and **ar-XB** (right-to-left). Both work without any translation existing, which makes them the practical way to test translation readiness now.

**Export/import (`util/`):** `JsonExporter` (full backup/restore), `IcsExporter` (calendar `.ics`), `MarkdownExporter` (plain-text task list for clipboard/share) all operate on the same domain models, independent of the DB layer. `JsonExporter` carries **photo bytes**, not just paths: profile/person photos are `file://` Uris into the app's `filesDir`, so a path-only backup restored a dangling reference. Person avatars get a `photoData` (base64) field alongside `photoUri`, and the user's own avatar rides at the JSON root since it lives in DataStore, not the DB. Backwards compatible both ways — an old backup with no `photoData` falls back to `photoUri`, and a restore only overwrites the profile photo when the backup actually carries one. Unit tests touching the payload need the `org.json` JVM dependency: the `android.jar` stubs throw, which turns every `JSONObject` assertion into an opaque `RuntimeException`.

**Debug signing:** `:app`'s `debug` signingConfig is overridden in `app/build.gradle.kts` to use `debug.keystore` at the repo root (alias/passwords are the standard `androiddebugkey`/`android`), so a debug build from any dev machine installs over the others without an uninstall. It is deliberately *not* `~/.android/debug.keystore` — that one is the machine-wide default every other Android project signs with, and replacing it there would force an uninstall on all of them instead. Gitignored via `*.keystore`, so a new machine needs the file copied across by hand; when it's absent the config is skipped and the build falls back to the default debug key rather than failing.

**Toolchain gotcha:** Compose BOM is `2025.12.00` (material3 1.4.0 — the Expressive generation, compose-ui 1.10.0), managed in `gradle/libs.versions.toml`. `Modifier.animateItemPlacement` was removed in Foundation 1.7 — use `Modifier.animateItem(placementSpec = ...)`. App version is `0.86 beta` (versionCode 8).
