# CLAUDE.md — Jottit

## What is Jottit?

Jottit is a radically simple web publishing tool. You go to jottit.org, write something in markdown, and get a beautiful page with a shareable URL. That's it.

Jottit is a page, not a blog platform. Jottit is open source.

## Design Philosophy

### What Jottit is
- One interaction: write → publish → share URL
- Beautiful typographic output (Medium-quality reading experience, serif font, generous whitespace, drop caps, perfect reading width)
- Markdown in, beautiful page out
- No accounts required to create a page
- No JavaScript on public pages
- Opinionated design — the design is so good you don't need to change it

### What Jottit is NOT
- A blogging platform
- A CMS
- A wiki
- A site builder

## Stack

- Flask + Jinja2 (server-side rendered)
- Vanilla JS (admin only — no JS on published pages)
- Vanilla CSS
- PostgreSQL

## Product Spec (v1)

### Homepage
```
                                          sign in
Jottit
[Create a page]
[tagline]
```

"Create a page" takes you directly to the editor at `jottit.org/[random-slug]/edit`. No intermediate steps.

"sign in" in the top right corner. After signing in, it becomes "settings".

### Editor
- Full-screen split preview: markdown on the left, rendered output on the right
- Pre-filled random slug, editable: "Your page will be at: jottit.org/[a7x3k]"
- Publish button
- That's it

### Published Page
- Just the content. Full width, beautiful typography
- No Jottit UI on user pages — no sign in link, no settings, no navigation
- "powered by Jottit" in the footer
- "last edited [timestamp]" with a link to revision history
- The first `# heading` in the markdown becomes the page title (no separate title field)

### Settings
- Accessible from jottit.org after signing in ("settings" link replaces "sign in" in top right)
- Public/private toggle
- Slug change
- Not a dashboard — one simple page

### Auth & Ownership
- No account required to create a page — zero friction
- Unclaimed pages show a "Claim this page" banner
- Claiming: enter your email, receive a 6-digit code, enter the code. Page is yours.
- Every sign-in uses the same flow: email → code. No passwords.
- Once claimed: sign-in required to edit
- Unclaimed pages are editable by anyone with the URL

### Visibility
- States: **listed** (on profile), **unlisted** (accessible but hidden from profile), **pinned** (top of profile), **draft** (only visible to owner)
- Simple toggles in settings

### Revision History
- Database-backed revisions
- Simple "last edited" timestamp that links to revision history
- Diff view between versions

### What's explicitly excluded
- Design/theme settings (the design IS the design)
- Wiki editing mode
- Custom domains

## Architecture

- No JavaScript on public pages
- Markdown rendering to clean HTML
- Static output where possible
- Database-backed revision history
- Clean, minimal URL structure: `jottit.org/[slug]`

## Commands

- `flask run --debug` — dev server with auto-reload
- `pytest` — run tests
- Commits: one-line messages only, no co-authored-by trailers

## Code Style

- Python: simple, readable, no clever abstractions
- HTML: semantic, minimal classes
- CSS: reuse existing classes and variables before adding new ones. Check what's already defined in stylesheets first. Never use inline styles — always use classes. Never use hardcoded color values — always use design tokens (CSS custom properties).
- JS: vanilla only, no build step, no frameworks. Admin only — no JS on published pages.
- Keep files small and focused
- Prefer explicit over clever
- Don't swallow errors — let exceptions propagate in development
- Don't add unused imports or reorganize existing ones
- Don't add comments that restate what the code does
- Do only what was asked — no bonus features, no "while I'm at it" additions

## Testing

- Always add tests when implementing new features
- Bug fixes: write a failing test first, then fix the bug, then verify the test passes
- Cover the happy path and obvious edge cases, don't over-test

## Don't

- Add features without discussing the tradeoff
- Introduce dependencies without justification
- Build dashboards or admin UIs
- Over-engineer — this is a simple app, keep it that way

## Relationship to Original Jottit (2007)

Features from the original and their status:

| Original Feature | 2026 Status |
|---|---|
| Homepage textarea | **Replaced** — "Create a page" button instead |
| Split preview editor | **Keep** — simplest honest solution for markdown |
| Subdomains (yourname.jottit.com) | **Keep** — username.jottit.org |
| Multiple pages per user | **Keep** — listed, unlisted, pinned |
| Wiki editing mode (anyone can edit) | **Drop** — spam, moderation complexity |
| Private/Public/Open modes | **Simplify** to Private/Public only |
| Revision history with diffs | **Keep** — hidden complexity |
| Site title, subtitle, description | **Drop** — first heading is the title |
| Design/theme settings | **Drop** — opinionated design |
| Claim this site flow | **Keep** — zero-friction creation, claim when ready |
| Custom site address | **Drop for v1** |
| Atom export | **Maybe later** |

## gstack

Use `/browse` from gstack for all web browsing. Never use `mcp__Claude_in_Chrome__*` tools.

Available skills: `/office-hours`, `/plan-ceo-review`, `/plan-eng-review`, `/plan-design-review`, `/design-consultation`, `/design-shotgun`, `/design-html`, `/review`, `/ship`, `/land-and-deploy`, `/canary`, `/benchmark`, `/browse`, `/connect-chrome`, `/qa`, `/qa-only`, `/design-review`, `/setup-browser-cookies`, `/setup-deploy`, `/retro`, `/investigate`, `/document-release`, `/codex`, `/cso`, `/autoplan`, `/plan-devex-review`, `/devex-review`, `/careful`, `/freeze`, `/guard`, `/unfreeze`, `/gstack-upgrade`, `/learn`.

## Key Reference

The target reading experience for published pages is Medium's article typography: serif font, generous line height, proper reading width, drop caps, lots of whitespace — but with zero UI chrome around it.

## Skill routing

When the user's request matches an available skill, ALWAYS invoke it using the Skill
tool as your FIRST action. Do NOT answer directly, do NOT use other tools first.
The skill has specialized workflows that produce better results than ad-hoc answers.

Key routing rules:
- Product ideas, "is this worth building", brainstorming → invoke office-hours
- Bugs, errors, "why is this broken", 500 errors → invoke investigate
- Ship, deploy, push, create PR → invoke ship
- QA, test the site, find bugs → invoke qa
- Code review, check my diff → invoke review
- Update docs after shipping → invoke document-release
- Weekly retro → invoke retro
- Design system, brand → invoke design-consultation
- Visual audit, design polish → invoke design-review
- Architecture review → invoke plan-eng-review
- Save progress, checkpoint, resume → invoke checkpoint
- Code quality, health check → invoke health
