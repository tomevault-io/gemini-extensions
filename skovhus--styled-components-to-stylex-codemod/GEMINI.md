# Agent Guide

This file provides guidance to AI coding agents when working with code in this repository.

## Cross-Agent Compatibility

- `AGENTS.md` is the primary entry point for Codex/OpenAI agents.
- `CLAUDE.md` exists for Claude-compatible tooling and should stay in sync with this file.
- In this repository, `AGENTS.md` is a symlink to `CLAUDE.md`, so editing `CLAUDE.md` updates both entry points.
- Skill files live under `.claude/skills/` for historical reasons, but they are plain Markdown playbooks that any agent can read and follow directly.
- If your environment does not support first-class "skills", open the relevant `SKILL.md` file and follow it manually.
- When another repo document says to "use a skill", interpret that as "read the matching `SKILL.md` file and follow its process" if your agent runtime does not have a native skill system.

## Self-Improvement

If you discover undocumented requirements, commands, or workflows during your work (e.g., a reviewer asks you to run something not covered here), update this file on the same PR. Keep this guide accurate and helpful for future agents.

## Project Overview

Codemod to transform styled-components to StyleX using jscodeshift.

## Commands

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm test:run    # Run tests once
pnpm check       # Run full validation (lint, typecheck, tests, knip, Storybook build, build, format)
```

## Rules

- src folder code should never depend on test-cases or test-case logic
- transformations should be safe and lossless, bail if we cannot preserve the semantics of the input
- adjacent sibling selectors (`+`) are not representable losslessly with current StyleX APIs; bail instead of approximating them as general siblings (`~`)
- run `pnpm check` to validate changes. It covers the same validation categories as `pnpm run ci`, so do not run both unless explicitly requested.
- when fixing bugs or addressing review comments, add test coverage to document the regression and prevent future breakage. **Prefer extending an existing test case** over creating a new one — only create a new test case when no existing case covers the same category/feature area
- when addressing PR review comments, resolve the addressed review threads after pushing the fix, then re-fetch thread state to verify they are resolved. Leave only unaddressed, ambiguous, or reviewer-confirmation-needed threads open.
- after creating a PR, make it ready for review (not draft), address actionable review comments, then poll for new PR review comments about every 90 seconds for up to 10 minutes. If new actionable comments appear, address them, push, resolve addressed threads, and repeat the same polling loop until no new review comments appear during a full polling window.
- before making any changes, explore the codebase to find ALL files that contain the pattern I'm about to describe. List every file, show the relevant code, and confirm you understand the full scope. Then propose a complete change plan covering every file.
- when `adapter.externalInterface` is `"auto"`, treat prepass as required: if prepass fails, throw (do not silently fall back); only function-based `externalInterface` may continue on prepass failure with a warning

## Code guidelines

- Prefer iteration & modularization over code duplication.
- **Unify and abstract**: Use existing primitives/helpers whenever possible. Extend or generalize shared utilities instead of adding parallel logic so the codebase uses the same primitives consistently.
- **Centralize common logic**: When adding new functionality, look for existing helper functions that can be extended rather than duplicating patterns. Key utilities like `literalToStaticValue` in `builtin-handlers.ts` handle AST node extraction and should be enhanced to support new node types rather than adding ad-hoc checks elsewhere.
- **keep all exports at the top of each file** (after imports), and keep **non-exported helpers further down**
- TypeScript: Avoid `any`; use proper types. (Some jscodeshift AST patterns are hard to type precisely—minimal, justified assertions are acceptable there.)
- Prefer type definitions; avoid type assertions (as, !) where feasible.
- Use descriptive names for variables & functions

## StyleX Constraints

StyleX does NOT support CSS shorthand properties. When transforming CSS to StyleX:

- `border` must expand to `borderWidth`, `borderStyle`, `borderColor`
- `margin`/`padding` must expand to directional properties (`marginTop`, etc.)
- `background` must map to `backgroundColor` or `backgroundImage`

**Key files for shorthand handling:**

- `src/internal/css-prop-mapping.ts` - `cssDeclarationToStylexDeclarations()` is the authoritative source for shorthand expansion
- `src/internal/lower-rules/borders.ts` - Handles interpolated border values
- Use `parseInterpolatedBorderStaticParts()` when parsing border values with dynamic expressions

When adding new CSS-to-StyleX transformations, always use these existing helpers rather than directly mapping CSS property names.

## StyleX Runtime Behavior

**Deterministic ordering**: StyleX guarantees that later entries in `stylex.props()` override earlier ones for conflicting properties. This is true regardless of whether styles are static or dynamic. The codemod's `variantSourceOrder` tracking preserves the original CSS cascade order by interleaving variant and styleFn entries during emission.

**Dynamic styles use CSS variables, not inline styles**: A dynamic StyleX style like `styles.flexAlignItems(align)` compiles to a CSS class (e.g., `.x123 { align-items: var(--x123) }`) with the variable value set as an inline style (`--x123: center`). The actual CSS property (`align-items`) is still resolved via the CSS class, NOT as a true inline style. This means static and dynamic StyleX styles participate in the same cascade — array ordering in `stylex.props()` determines priority.

**Prefer static styles over dynamic styles for performance**: When a CSS property has a small, known set of values (e.g., `display: flex | inline-flex`, `flex-direction: row | column | row-reverse | column-reverse`), emit separate static styles selected by JavaScript conditionals rather than a single dynamic function call. For example, prefer:

```tsx
inline ? styles.flexInline : styles.flexDefault; // static: two CSS classes
```

over:

```tsx
styles.flexDisplay(inline ? "inline-flex" : "flex"); // dynamic: CSS variable
```

Static styles produce atomic CSS classes that can be shared and cached, while dynamic styles require a CSS variable indirection per-instance.

**Inline style spread order**: When the codemod emits an inline style object that combines template-computed values with the user's `style` prop, the user's `style` must spread last so it can override template defaults. This matches styled-components behavior where the `style` prop overrides CSS class values:

```tsx
{ flexDirection: computedValue, ...style }  // ✓ user's style can override
{ ...style, flexDirection: computedValue }  // ✗ template overrides user's style
```

## Scripts

Run repo scripts directly with `node`, see `scripts` folder

- `scripts/debug-test.mts` - Generates `.actual.tsx` files for failing test cases to compare against expected `.output.tsx` files. Run with `node scripts/debug-test.mts`.
- `scripts/regenerate-test-case-outputs.mts` - Updates test case output files.
  - All supported test cases: `node scripts/regenerate-test-case-outputs.mts`
  - Single test case: `node scripts/regenerate-test-case-outputs.mts --only attrs`
- `scripts/verify-storybook-rendering.mts` - Verifies that input (styled-components) and output (StyleX) render with matching dimensions and content in Storybook. Self-contained: builds Storybook, starts a static file server, and auto-installs Playwright Chromium if needed. Uses pixelmatch for pixel-level image comparison.
- All test cases: `node scripts/verify-storybook-rendering.mts`
- Specific test case: `node scripts/verify-storybook-rendering.mts theme-conditionalInlineStyle`
- Only changed vs main: `node scripts/verify-storybook-rendering.mts --only-changed`
- Save diff images: `node scripts/verify-storybook-rendering.mts --save-diffs`

## Adding Test Cases

Create matching `.input.tsx` and `.output.tsx` files in `test-cases/`. Tests auto-discover all pairs and fail if any file is missing its counterpart.

Test cases that the codemod cannot transform use two prefixes to distinguish the reason:

- **`_unsupported.<case>.input.tsx`** — StyleX **architecturally cannot express** this CSS pattern (e.g., descendant/child combinators, `createGlobalStyle`, specificity hacks), or a static codemod **fundamentally cannot resolve** it at build time. These will likely never be supported.
- **`_unimplemented.<case>.input.tsx`** — StyleX **has the APIs** to express this, but the codemod **hasn't built the transform yet** (e.g., sibling selectors via `stylex.when.siblingBefore()`, cross-file component selectors via `stylex.defineMarker()`). These are planned future work.

Both prefixes should **NOT** have an output file. Both are excluded from supported test runs, Storybook, and the playground.

### Prefer Extending Existing Test Cases

Before creating a new test case, check whether an existing test case already covers the same category or feature area. If so, **extend the existing test case** by adding the new pattern as additional styled components or JSX variations in the `App` component. This keeps test cases comprehensive and avoids test sprawl.

For example, to test a new grid property behavior, extend `css-gridTemplate` rather than creating a new `css-gridRowType` test case. To test a new conditional pattern, extend an existing `conditional-*` case if one already covers similar ground.

Only create a new test case when:

- No existing case covers the same category
- The pattern is fundamentally different enough to warrant its own file
- Adding to an existing case would make it unwieldy or unclear

### Creating a Test Case Step-by-Step

1. **Write the `.input.tsx` file** in `test-cases/` with a styled-components example:
   - First line should be a short comment describing what pattern is being tested
   - Import `styled` from `"styled-components"` (and `* as React` if needed)
   - Define styled component(s) demonstrating the pattern
   - Export `const App` or `function App` rendering all variations with visible CSS
   - For theme access, use `props.theme.color.<key>` or `props.theme.isDark` — the fixture adapter resolves `theme.color.*` to `$colors.*` from `./tokens.stylex`

2. **Generate the `.output.tsx` file** using the regeneration script:

   ```bash
   node scripts/regenerate-test-case-outputs.mts --only <case-name>
   ```

   This runs the codemod with the fixture adapter and writes the output. Verify it's correct.

3. **For bug-reproduction test cases** where the codemod produces wrong output:
   - Write the `.output.tsx` manually showing the **correct** expected transformation
   - The test will fail, clearly showing the diff between actual (buggy) and expected (correct) output
   - Use `node scripts/debug-test.mts` to generate `.actual.tsx` files for comparison

4. **Run and verify**:
   ```bash
   pnpm test:run                    # All tests
   npx vitest run -t "<case-name>"  # Single test case
   pnpm storybook                   # Visual comparison
   ```

**Key conventions for output files:**

- Import `* as stylex from "@stylexjs/stylex"` and `{ mergedSx } from "./lib/mergedSx"` when the component accepts external className/style
- Theme colors become `$colors.<key>` from `"./tokens.stylex"`
- CSS shorthand properties must be expanded (e.g., `padding: "4px 8px"` → `paddingTop: "4px"`, `paddingRight: "8px"`, `paddingBottom: "4px"`, `paddingLeft: "8px"`)
- Unexported intrinsic-only styled components get inlined (no wrapper function), unless they are used more than once in JSX (then keep a wrapper for readability/reuse)
- Exported or component-wrapping styled components become function components
- Conditional styles use separate style objects: `styles.base`, `styles.baseActive`

### Promoting Bail-Out Test Cases

When promoting an `_unsupported` or `_unimplemented` test case to a supported one (adding codemod support for a previously unsupported pattern):

- **Preserve the original input code**: Keep the original styled-component definition and CSS as-is. The codemod must handle the original input. You may extend the test case (e.g., add more CSS properties or variations), but do not modify or remove the original code.
- Remove `@expected-warning` comments and update descriptive comments as needed (these are not semantic changes).
- It is OK to minimally improve the `App` component for visibility (e.g., adding text content to an empty `<Box />`), since that doesn't change the styled-component transformation being tested.
- Create the matching `.output.tsx` using `node scripts/regenerate-test-case-outputs.mts --only <case>`.

### Test Case Naming Convention

Test cases follow a `category-variation` naming scheme:

- **Category**: The feature area being tested (e.g., `attrs`, `conditional`, `wrapper`, `theme`)
- **Variation**: A lowerCamelCase suffix describing the specific scenario (e.g., `polymorphicAs`, `complexTernary`)
- **Separator**: A single `-` between category and variation
- If a category has only one test case, no variation suffix is needed (e.g., `ref`, `styleObject`, `withConfig`)
- Use **neutral, descriptive** names — avoid bug-sounding words like "Lost", "NotResolved", "Missing", "Broken"

Examples: `attrs-polymorphicAs`, `conditional-enumIfChain`, `wrapper-basic`, `theme-destructure`

For bail-out files, keep the appropriate prefix (`_unsupported.` or `_unimplemented.`) and apply the same `category-variation` scheme after it: `_unsupported.selector-complex`, `_unimplemented.selector-sibling`

**Categories**: `basic`, `extending`, `attrs`, `asProp`, `conditional`, `interpolation`, `mixin`, `cssHelper`, `selector`, `theme`, `useTheme`, `wrapper`, `externalStyles`, `helper`, `cssVariable`, `mediaQuery`, `transientProp`, `shouldForwardProp`, `withConfig`, `keyframes`, `variant`, `css`, `htmlProp`, `typeHandling`, `import`, `staticProp`, `ref`, `styleObject`, `naming`, `example`

### Test Case Visual Guidelines

Every test case `App` component must render **visibly** in Storybook so input and output can be compared side-by-side:

- Use **visible CSS properties**: `background-color`, `color`, `border`, `padding` — not SVG-only props like `fill` on `div` elements
- Give components **meaningful size**: at least 40-80px so they're easy to spot in the debug frame
- Add **text labels** inside components to identify each variation (e.g. "On", "Off", "Default")
- Show **all prop variations** in `App`: enabled, disabled, default/no-prop, different enum values
- Use `gap` and `padding` on the container so items aren't cramped
- Verify in Storybook (`pnpm storybook`) that both input and output render identically

## Storybook Visual Testing

Storybook renders all test cases side-by-side (input with styled-components, output with StyleX) to visually verify the transformation produces identical styles. Visual verification is pixel-perfect: input and output must match exactly, and any pixel-level variation is a failure that must be fixed rather than accepted.

- **Auto-discovery**: Test cases are automatically discovered from `test-cases/*.input.tsx` and `*.output.tsx` files
- **"All" story**: Shows all test cases on a single page at `http://localhost:6006/?path=/story/test-cases--all`
- **Individual stories**: Each test case has its own story URL, e.g., `http://localhost:6006/?path=/story/test-cases--enum-if-chain`

Run `pnpm storybook` to start the dev server and visually compare transformations.

To verify rendering programmatically, run `node scripts/verify-storybook-rendering.mts`. The script is self-contained: it builds Storybook, starts a static file server, and auto-installs Playwright Chromium. Use `--only-changed` to check only test cases changed on the current branch, or `--save-diffs` to save diff images for mismatches. Do not approve or merge a visual verification run with pixel diffs; there is no acceptable tolerance for visual drift.

## Environment Variables

- `DEBUG_CODEMOD=1` — Enables verbose prepass diagnostic logging to stderr. Dumps every cross-file selector usage with full paths, components needing marker sidecars or global selector bridges, and consumer analysis entries. Useful for debugging cross-file resolution issues.

## Skills

Skills are located in `.claude/skills/`.

Available playbooks:

- `.claude/skills/address-review-comments/SKILL.md`
- `.claude/skills/create-pr/SKILL.md`
- `.claude/skills/refactor-code-quality/SKILL.md`
- `.claude/skills/stylex-authoring/SKILL.md`
- `.claude/skills/thermo-nuclear-code-quality-review/SKILL.md`

These files are repository documentation, not Claude-only metadata. Codex-compatible agents should read them directly when the task matches their scope.

## Plans

- Store implementation plans in `plans/` as markdown files
- Name format: `YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name.md`

## Pull Request Descriptions

Keep PR descriptions **very short** — 1-3 sentences max. Just say what changed and why. Do not add sections like "Summary", "Test case", "Test plan", "Changes", or checklists. Do not enumerate files changed or repeat what's obvious from the diff. Less is more.

After opening a PR, keep it ready for review rather than draft. Address actionable review comments, push fixes, resolve the addressed threads, and poll for new review comments about every 90 seconds for up to 10 minutes. If new actionable comments appear during that window, address them and restart the same push/resolve/poll loop.

## Post-Implementation Workflow

After implementing any feature or fix, agents MUST:

1. **Validate changes**: Run `pnpm check` to ensure all linting, type checking, and tests pass
2. **Run code quality refactoring**: Use the [refactor-code-quality](.claude/skills/refactor-code-quality/SKILL.md) skill to:
   - Remove code duplication and extract shared patterns
   - Minimize `any` types (some jscodeshift patterns may require them)
   - Minimize type assertions (`as Type`) and non-null assertions (`!`)
3. **Validate again**: Run `pnpm check` after refactoring
4. **Commit and push**: Make atomic commits with descriptive messages
