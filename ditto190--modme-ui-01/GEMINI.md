## modme-ui-01

> Documentation-first development methodology. The goal is AI-ready documentation - when docs are clear enough, code generation becomes automatic. Triggers on "Build", "Create", "Implement", "Document", or "Spec out". Version 3.4 adds complete 13-item Clarity Gate with scoring rubric and self-assessment.


# Stream Coding v3.4: Documentation-First Development

## ⚠️ CRITICAL REFRAME: THIS IS A DOCUMENTATION METHODOLOGY, NOT A CODING METHODOLOGY

**The Goal:** AI-ready documentation. When documentation is clear enough, code generation becomes automatic.

**The Insight:**

> "If your docs are good enough, AI writes the code. The hard work IS the documentation. Code is just the printout."

**v3.4 Core Addition:** Complete 13-item Clarity Gate with scoring rubric. The gate is the methodology—skip it and you're back to vibe coding.

## THE STREAM CODING TRUTH

```
Messy Docs → Vague Specs → AI Guesses → Rework Cycles → 2-3x Velocity
Clear Docs → Clear Specs → AI Executes → Minimal Rework → 10-20x Velocity
```

**Why Most "AI-Assisted Development" Fails:**

- People feed AI messy docs
- AI generates code based on assumptions
- Code doesn't match intent
- Endless revision cycles
- Result: Marginally faster than manual coding

**Why Stream Coding Achieves 10-20x:**

- Documentation is clarified FIRST
- AI has zero ambiguity
- Code matches intent on first pass
- Minimal revision
- Result: Documentation time + automatic code generation

---

## DOCUMENT TYPE ARCHITECTURE

**The Rule:** Not all documents need all sections. Putting implementation details in strategic documents violates single-source-of-truth.

> "If AI has to decide where to find information, you've already lost velocity."

### Document Types

| Type               | Purpose      | Examples                                                   |
| ------------------ | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Strategic**      | WHAT and WHY | Master Blueprint, PRD, Vision docs, Business cases         |
| **Implementation** | HOW          | Technical Specs, API docs, Module specs, Architecture docs |
| **Reference**      | Lookup       | Schema Reference, Glossary, Configuration                  |

### Section Placement Matrix

| Section                      | Strategic Docs  | Implementation Docs | Reference Docs |
| ---------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------- | -------------- |
| **Deep Links (References)**  | ✅ Required     | ✅ Required         | ✅ Required    |
| **Anti-patterns**            | ❌ Pointer only | ✅ Required         | ❌ N/A         |
| **Test Case Specifications** | ❌ Pointer only | ✅ Required         | ❌ N/A         |
| **Error Handling Matrix**    | ❌ Pointer only | ✅ Required         | ❌ N/A         |

### Why This Matters

**Wrong (violates single-source-of-truth):**

```
Master Blueprint
├── Strategy content
├── Anti-patterns ← WRONG: duplicates Technical Spec
├── Test Cases ← WRONG: duplicates Testing doc
└── Error Matrix ← WRONG: duplicates Error Handling doc
```

**Right (single-source-of-truth):**

```
Master Blueprint (Strategic)
├── Strategy content
└── References
    └── Pointer: "Anti-patterns → Technical Spec, Section 7"

Technical Spec (Implementation)
├── Implementation details
├── Anti-patterns ← CORRECT: lives here
├── Test Cases ← CORRECT: lives here
└── Error Matrix ← CORRECT: lives here
```

## THE 4-PHASE METHODOLOGY

### Time Allocation

| Phase                           | Time | Focus                                               |
| ------------------------------- | ---- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Phase 1: Strategic Thinking     | 40%  | WHAT to build, WHY it matters                       |
| Phase 2: AI-Ready Documentation | 40%  | HOW to build (specs so clear AI has zero decisions) |
| Phase 3: Execution              | 15%  | Code generation + implementation                    |
| Phase 4: Quality & Iteration    | 5%   | Testing, refinement, divergence prevention          |

**The Counterintuitive Truth:** 80% of time goes to documentation. 20% to code. This is why velocity is 10-20x—not because coding is faster, but because rework approaches zero.

---

## PHASE 1: STRATEGIC THINKING (40% of time)

### Decision Tree: Where Do You Start?

```
Phase 1: Strategic Product Thinking
│
├─ Have existing documentation?
│   └─ YES → Start with Documentation Audit → then 7 Questions
│
└─ Starting fresh?
    └─ Skip to 7 Questions
```

### Documentation Audit (Conditional)

**Skip this step if starting from scratch.** The Documentation Audit only applies when you have existing documentation—previous specs, inherited docs, or accumulated notes.

**Why clean existing docs?** Because most documentation accumulates cruft:

- Aspirational statements ("We will revolutionize...")
- Speculative futures ("In 2030, we might...")
- Outdated decisions (v1 architecture in v3 docs)
- Duplicate information across files
- Motivational fluff with no implementation value

**The Audit Process:**

Apply the Clarity Test to all existing documentation:

| Check             | Question                                                  |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Actionable**    | Can AI act on this? If aspirational, delete it.           |
| **Current**       | Is this still the decision? If changed, update or remove. |
| **Single Source** | Is this said elsewhere? Consolidate to one place.         |
| **Decision**      | Is this decided? If not, don't include it.                |
| **Prompt-Ready**  | Would you put this in an AI prompt? If not, delete.       |

**Audit Checklist:**

- [ ] Remove all "vision" and "future state" language
- [ ] Delete motivational conclusions and preambles
- [ ] Consolidate duplicate information to single source
- [ ] Update all outdated architectural decisions
- [ ] Remove speculative features not in current scope

**Target:** 40-50% reduction in volume without losing actionable information.

Once clean, proceed to the 7 Questions.

---

### The 7 Questions Framework

Before ANY new documentation, answer these with specificity. Vague answers = vague code.

| #   | Question                               | ❌ Reject                   | ✅ Require                                                                   |
| --- | -------------------------------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | What exact problem are you solving?    | "Help users manage tasks"   | "Help [specific persona] achieve [measurable outcome] in [specific context]" |
| 2   | What are your success metrics?         | "Users save time"           | Numbers + timeline: "100 users, 25% conversion, 3 months"                    |
| 3   | Why will you win?                      | "Better UI and features"    | Structural advantage: architecture, data moat, business model                |
| 4   | What's the core architecture decision? | "Let AI decide"             | Human decides based on explicit trade-off analysis                           |
| 5   | What's the tech stack rationale?       | "Node.js because I like it" | Business rationale: "Node—team expertise, ship fast"                         |
| 6   | What are the MVP features?             | 10+ "must-have" features    | 3-5 truly essential, rest explicitly deferred                                |
| 7   | What are you NOT building?             | "We'll see what users want" | Explicit exclusions with rationale                                           |

### Phase 1 Exit Criteria

- [ ] All 7 questions answered at "Require" level
- [ ] Strategic Blueprint document created
- [ ] Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for major choices
- [ ] Zero ambiguity about WHAT you're building

---

## PHASE 2: AI-READY DOCUMENTATION (40% of time)

### The 4 Mandatory Sections (Implementation Docs)

Every implementation document MUST include these four sections. Without them, AI guesses—and guessing creates the velocity mirage.

#### 1. Anti-Patterns Section

**Why:** AI needs to know what NOT to do.

```markdown
## Anti-Patterns (DO NOT)

| ❌ Don't                          | ✅ Do Instead                    | Why                              |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Store timestamps as Date objects  | Use ISO 8601 strings             | Serialization issues             |
| Hardcode configuration values     | Use environment variables        | Deployment flexibility           |
| Use generic error messages        | Specific error codes per failure | Debugging impossible otherwise   |
| Skip validation on internal calls | Validate everything              | Internal calls can have bugs too |
| Expose internal IDs in APIs       | Use UUIDs or slugs               | Security and flexibility         |
```

**Rules:** Minimum 5 anti-patterns per implementation document.

#### 2. Test Case Specifications

**Why:** AI needs concrete verification criteria.

```markdown
## Test Case Specifications

### Unit Tests Required

| Test ID | Component        | Input          | Expected Output        | Edge Cases                 |
| ------- | ---------------- | -------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------- |
| TC-001  | Tier classifier  | 100 contacts   | 20-30 in Critical tier | Empty list, all same score |
| TC-002  | Score calculator | Activity array | Score 0-100            | No events, >1000 events    |

### Integration Tests Required

| Test ID | Flow      | Setup            | Verification        | Teardown         |
| ------- | --------- | ---------------- | ------------------- | ---------------- |
| IT-001  | Auth flow | Create test user | Token refresh works | Delete test user |
```

**Rules:** Minimum 5 unit tests, 3 integration tests per component.

#### 3. Error Handling Matrix

**Why:** AI needs to know how to handle every failure mode.

```markdown
## Error Handling Matrix

### External Service Errors

| Error Type  | Detection    | Response             | Fallback        | Logging | Alert         |
| ----------- | ------------ | -------------------- | --------------- | ------- | ------------- |
| API timeout | >5s response | Retry 3x exponential | Return cached   | ERROR   | If 3 in 5 min |
| Rate limit  | 429 response | Pause 15 min         | Queue for retry | WARN    | If >5/hour    |

### User-Facing Errors

| Error Type      | User Message                         | Code | Recovery Action   |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------ | ---- | ----------------- |
| Quota exceeded  | "You've used all checks this month." | 403  | Show upgrade CTA  |
| Session expired | "Please sign in again."              | 401  | Redirect to login |
```

**Rules:** Every external service and user-facing error must be specified.

#### 4. Deep Links (All Document Types)

**Why:** AI needs to navigate to exact locations. "See Technical Annexes" is useless.

```markdown
## References

### Schema References

| Topic         | Location                                               | Anchor          |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------- |
| User profiles | [Schema Reference](../schemas/schema.md#user_profiles) | `user_profiles` |
| Events table  | [Schema Reference](../schemas/schema.md#events)        | `events`        |

### Implementation References

| Topic         | Document                                   | Section     |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ----------- |
| Auth flow     | [API Spec](../specs/api.md#authentication) | Section 3.2 |
| Rate limiting | [API Spec](../specs/api.md#rate-limiting)  | Section 5   |
```

**Rules:** NEVER use vague references. ALWAYS include document path + section anchor.

---

## ⚠️ THE CLARITY GATE (v3.4 - COMPLETE)

**⛔ NEVER SKIP THIS GATE.**

This is the difference between stream coding and vibe coding. A 7/10 spec generates 7/10 code that needs 30% rework.

### The 13-Item Clarity Gate Checklist

Before ANY code generation, verify ALL items pass:

#### Foundation Checks (7 items)

| #   | Check                  | Question                                                    |
| --- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | **Actionable**         | Can AI act on every section? (No aspirational content)      |
| 2   | **Current**            | Is everything up-to-date? (No outdated decisions)           |
| 3   | **Single Source**      | No duplicate information across docs?                       |
| 4   | **Decision, Not Wish** | Every statement is a decision, not a hope?                  |
| 5   | **Prompt-Ready**       | Would you put every section in an AI prompt?                |
| 6   | **No Future State**    | All "will eventually," "might," "ideally" language removed? |
| 7   | **No Fluff**           | All motivational/aspirational content removed?              |

#### Document Architecture Checks (6 items - v3.3 Critical)

| #   | Check                     | Question                                                                  |
| --- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 8   | **Type Identified**       | Document type clearly marked? (Strategic vs Implementation vs Reference)  |
| 9   | **Anti-patterns Placed**  | Anti-patterns in implementation docs only? (Strategic docs have pointers) |
| 10  | **Test Cases Placed**     | Test cases in implementation docs only? (Strategic docs have pointers)    |
| 11  | **Error Handling Placed** | Error handling matrix in implementation docs only?                        |
| 12  | **Deep Links Present**    | Deep links in ALL documents? (No vague "see elsewhere")                   |
| 13  | **No Duplicates**         | Strategic docs use pointers, not duplicate content?                       |

### Gate Enforcement

```
- [ ] All 7 Foundation Checks pass
- [ ] All 6 Document Architecture Checks pass
- [ ] AI Coder Understandability Score ≥ 9/10

If ANY item fails → Fix before proceeding to Phase 3
```

---

## AI CODER UNDERSTANDABILITY SCORING

Use this rubric to score documentation. Target: 9+/10 before Phase 3.

### The 6-Criterion Rubric

| Criterion             | Weight | 10/10 Requirement                                            |
| --------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Actionability**     | 25%    | Every section has Implementation Implication                 |
| **Specificity**       | 20%    | All numbers concrete, all thresholds explicit                |
| **Consistency**       | 15%    | Single source of truth, no duplicates across docs            |
| **Structure**         | 15%    | Tables over prose, clear hierarchy, predictable format       |
| **Disambiguation**    | 15%    | Anti-patterns present (5+ per impl doc), edge cases explicit |
| **Reference Clarity** | 10%    | Deep links only, no vague references                         |

### Score Interpretation

| Score  | Meaning                                         | Action                  |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| 10/10  | AI can implement with zero clarifying questions | Proceed to Phase 3      |
| 9/10   | 1 minor clarification needed                    | Fix, then proceed       |
| 7-8/10 | 3-5 ambiguities exist                           | Major revision required |
| <7/10  | Not AI-ready, fundamental issues                | Return to Phase 2       |

### Self-Assessment Questions

Before Phase 3, ask yourself:

1. **Actionability:** "Does every section tell AI exactly what to do?"
2. **Specificity:** "Are there any numbers I left vague?"
3. **Consistency:** "Is any information stated in more than one place?"
4. **Structure:** "Could I convert any prose paragraphs to tables?"
5. **Disambiguation:** "Have I listed at least 5 anti-patterns per implementation doc?"
6. **Reference Clarity:** "Do any references say 'see elsewhere' without exact location?"

If you answer "no" or "yes" to any question that should be opposite → Fix before proceeding.

---

## AI-ASSISTED CLARITY GATE (Meta-Prompt)

Use this prompt to have Claude score your documentation:

```markdown
**ROLE:** You are the Clarity Gatekeeper. Your job is to ruthlessly
evaluate software specifications for ambiguity, incompleteness, and
"vibe coding" tendencies.

**INPUT:** I will provide a technical specification document.

**TASK:** Grade this document on a scale of 1-10 using this rubric:

**RUBRIC:**

1. **Actionability (25%):** Does every section dictate a specific
   implementation detail? (Reject aspirational like "fast" or
   "scalable" without metrics)
2. **Specificity (20%):** Are data types, error codes, thresholds,
   and edge cases explicitly defined? (Reject "handle errors appropriately")
3. **Consistency (15%):** Single source of truth? No duplicates?
4. **Structure (15%):** Tables over prose? Clear hierarchy?
5. **Disambiguation (15%):** Anti-patterns present? Edge cases explicit?
6. **Reference Clarity (10%):** Deep links only? No vague references?

**OUTPUT FORMAT:**

1. **Score:** [X]/10
2. **Criterion Breakdown:** Score each of the 6 criteria
3. **Hallucination Risks:** List specific lines where an AI developer
   would have to guess or make an assumption
4. **The Fix:** Rewrite the 3 most ambiguous sections into AI-ready specs

**THRESHOLD:**

- 9-10: Ready for code generation
- 7-8: Needs revision before proceeding
- <7: Return to Phase 2
```

---

## PHASE 3: EXECUTION (15% of time)

### The Generate-Verify-Integrate Loop

```
1. GENERATE: Feed spec to AI → Receive code
2. VERIFY: Run tests → Check against spec
   - Does output match spec exactly?
   - Yes → Continue
   - No → Fix SPEC first, then regenerate
3. INTEGRATE: Commit → Update documentation if needed
```

### The Golden Rule of Phase 3

> **"When code fails, fix the spec—not the code."**

If generated code doesn't work:

1. ❌ Don't patch the code manually
2. ✅ Ask: "What was unclear in my spec?"
3. ✅ Fix the spec
4. ✅ Regenerate

**Why:** Manual code patches create divergence between spec and reality. Divergence compounds. Eventually your spec is fiction and you're back to manual development.

---

## PHASE 4: QUALITY & ITERATION (5% of time)

### The Rule of Divergence

> **Every time you manually edit AI-generated code without updating the spec, you create Divergence. Divergence is technical debt.**

**Why Divergence is Dangerous:**

- If you fix a bug in code but not spec, you can never regenerate that module
- Future AI iterations will reintroduce the bug
- You've broken the stream

### Preventing Divergence

| Scenario              | ❌ Wrong            | ✅ Right                        |
| --------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Bug in generated code | Fix code manually   | Fix spec, regenerate            |
| Missing edge case     | Add code patch      | Add to spec, regenerate         |
| Performance issue     | Optimize code       | Document constraint, regenerate |
| "Quick fix" needed    | "Just this once..." | No. Fix spec.                   |

### The "Day 2" Workflow

1. **Isolate the Module:** Target the specific module, not the whole app
2. **Update the Spec:** Add the new edge case, requirement, or fix
3. **Regenerate the Module:** Feed updated spec to AI
4. **Verify Integration:** Run test suite for regressions

This takes 5 minutes longer than a quick hotfix. But it ensures your documentation never drifts from reality.

## TRIGGER BEHAVIOR

This methodology activates when the user says:

- "Build [feature]" → Full methodology (Phases 1-4)
- "Create [component]" → Full methodology
- "Implement [system]" → Check: Do clear docs exist?
- "Document [project]" → Phases 1-2 only
- "Spec out [feature]" → Phases 1-2 only
- "Clean up docs for [X]" → Documentation Audit only

### Response Protocol

1. **Check for existing docs:** "Do you have existing documentation for this project?"
2. **If existing docs:** "Let's start with a Documentation Audit to clean them before building."
3. **If Phase 1 incomplete:** "Before building, let's clarify strategy. [Ask 7 Questions]"
4. **If Phase 2 incomplete:** "Before coding, let's ensure documentation is AI-ready. [Run Clarity Gate]"
5. **If Clarity Gate not passed:** "Documentation scores [X]/10. Let's fix [specific issues] before proceeding."
6. **If Phase 3 ready:** "Documentation passes Clarity Gate (9+/10). Generating implementation..."
7. **If maintaining (Phase 4):** "Is this change spec-conformant? Let's update docs first."

- [ ] Score 9+/10 on AI Coder Understandability
- [ ] Answer all 6 self-assessment questions correctly

**Phase 3-4:**

- [ ] Show code before creating files
- [ ] Run quality gates (lint, type, test)
- [ ] When code fails: fix spec, regenerate
- [ ] Never create divergence (update spec with every code change)

### YOU CANNOT

- ❌ Build on existing docs without running Documentation Audit first
- ❌ Skip to coding without clear docs
- ❌ Accept vague specs ("handle errors appropriately")
- ❌ Skip Clarity Gate (even if you wrote the docs yourself)
- ❌ Put Anti-patterns/Test Cases/Error Handling in strategic docs
- ❌ Use vague references ("see Technical Annexes")
- ❌ Duplicate content across document types
- ❌ Iterate on code when problem is in spec
- ❌ Edit code without updating spec (creates Divergence)

## QUICK REFERENCE

### The 13-Item Clarity Gate

**Foundation (7):**

1. Actionable? 2. Current? 3. Single source? 4. Decision not wish?
2. Prompt-ready? 6. No future state? 7. No fluff?

**Architecture (6):** 8. Type identified? 9. Anti-patterns placed correctly? 10. Test cases placed correctly? 11. Error handling placed correctly? 12. Deep links present? 13. No duplicates?

### The Scoring Rubric

| Criterion         | Weight |
| ----------------- | ------ |
| Actionability     | 25%    |
| Specificity       | 20%    |
| Consistency       | 15%    |
| Structure         | 15%    |
| Disambiguation    | 15%    |
| Reference Clarity | 10%    |

### Core Mantras

1. "Documentation IS the work. Code is just the printout."
2. "When code fails, fix the spec—not the code."
3. "A 7/10 spec generates 7/10 code that needs 30% rework."
4. "If AI has to decide where to find information, you've already lost velocity."

**Version:** 3.4
**Changes from 3.3.1:**

- Complete 13-item Clarity Gate (was 5 items)
- Scoring rubric with 6 weighted criteria
- Self-assessment questions before Phase 3
- AI-assisted scoring meta-prompt included
- 4 mandatory section templates with examples
- Phase 1 questions with reject/require examples
- Documentation Audit integrated into Phase 1 (replaces "Phase 0")

**Core Insight:** The Clarity Gate is the methodology. Everything else supports getting docs to 9+/10.
