# MS Cloud Ninja User Management Tool

A Windows desktop application built with .NET 8.0 Windows Forms for managing Microsoft 365 user onboarding and offboarding operations. The application integrates with Microsoft Graph API to provide comprehensive user management capabilities.

**Always reference these instructions first and fallback to search or bash commands only when you encounter unexpected information that does not match the info here.**

## Working Effectively

### Prerequisites and Environment Setup
- **CRITICAL**: This application **ONLY builds and runs on Windows**. The project uses `net8.0-windows` target framework with Windows Forms.
- Download and install .NET 8.0 SDK from: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0
- Windows 10 or later is required for optimal dark mode support
- Visual Studio 2022 or Visual Studio Code with C# extension recommended for development

### Build Commands
- `dotnet restore MSCloudNinjaGraphAPI.sln` -- restores NuGet packages. Takes ~8 seconds. Expected security warnings about Azure.Identity package vulnerabilities.
- `dotnet build MSCloudNinjaGraphAPI.sln --configuration Debug` -- builds in Debug mode. Takes ~10 seconds. NEVER CANCEL.
- `dotnet build MSCloudNinjaGraphAPI.sln --configuration Release` -- builds in Release mode. Takes ~10 seconds. NEVER CANCEL.
- Set timeout to 60+ seconds for build commands to account for package restoration and compilation.

### Running the Application
- **Debug**: `dotnet run --project MSCloudNinjaGraphAPI --configuration Debug`
- **Release**: Build first, then run the executable: `MSCloudNinjaGraphAPI\bin\Release\net8.0-windows\User Management Tool by MSCloudNinja.exe`
- The application requires Microsoft 365 admin credentials and appropriate Graph API permissions to function properly

### Testing and Validation
- **No automated tests exist** - this repository has no test projects or test infrastructure
- **Manual testing required**: Always test functionality manually after making changes
- **Critical validation scenarios**:
  1. **Authentication Flow**: Test sign-in with Microsoft 365 admin account
  2. **User Offboarding**: Select a test user and perform disable operations (without executing)
  3. **User Onboarding**: Navigate to onboarding tab and verify license loading
  4. **UI Responsiveness**: Verify dark theme loads correctly and navigation works

### Security Considerations
- **KNOWN VULNERABILITIES**: Azure.Identity package 1.10.4 has moderate severity vulnerabilities
- Always use test/development tenants when developing - never use production Microsoft 365 environments
- The application requires sensitive Microsoft Graph permissions (User.ReadWrite.All, Group.ReadWrite.All)

## Repository Structure

### Key Projects and Files
- **MSCloudNinjaGraphAPI.sln** - Main solution file (single project)
- **MSCloudNinjaGraphAPI/MSCloudNinjaGraphAPI.csproj** - Main project file targeting `net8.0-windows`
- **MSCloudNinjaGraphAPI/Program.cs** - Application entry point
- **MSCloudNinjaGraphAPI/Form1.cs** - Main form with authentication and navigation

### Important Directories
```

│   ├── UserManagementService.cs  # Microsoft Graph API operations
│   └── LogService.cs             # Application logging
├── Controls/              # UI components
│   ├── UserOffboardingControl.cs # User offboarding interface
│   ├── UserOnboardingControl.cs  # User onboarding interface

└── Utils/                 # Utility classes
    └── ThemeColors.cs            # Dark theme color definitions
```

### Configuration Files
- **No external configuration files** - application uses hardcoded Graph API scopes and settings
- Logs are written to: `%LocalAppData%\MSCloudNinja\Logs\app_YYYYMMDD.log`

## Development Guidelines

### Build Environment Limitations
- **Linux/macOS**: Cannot build or run - will fail with "Microsoft.NET.Sdk.WindowsDesktop.targets not found"
- **Windows Containers**: May work but UI cannot be interacted with
- **GitHub Actions**: Must use `windows-latest` runners for any CI/CD workflows

### Code Quality
- No linters or code quality tools are configured - add these before implementing CI/CD
- No code formatting tools - recommend adding EditorConfig or running `dotnet format`
- Always maintain the existing dark theme color scheme when making UI changes

### Microsoft Graph Integration
- Application uses `InteractiveBrowserCredential` for authentication
- Required permissions: `User.ReadWrite.All`, `Group.ReadWrite.All`
- Always test Graph API calls with proper error handling
- The application queries both standard and beta Graph endpoints

### Common Development Tasks

#### Adding New Features
1. Add business logic to appropriate service class
2. Create or modify UI controls
3. Update the main form navigation if needed
4. Test manually with Microsoft 365 admin account
5. Ensure proper error handling and logging

#### Debugging Authentication Issues
- Check Windows credential manager for cached tokens
- Verify Azure AD app registration permissions
- Monitor application logs in `%LocalAppData%\MSCloudNinja\Logs\`

#### UI Development
- Use existing ThemeColors class for consistent dark theme
- Test on Windows 10 and 11 for proper dark mode title bar
- Ensure proper control anchoring for different window sizes

## Validation Requirements

### Pre-commit Checklist
- Build succeeds in both Debug and Release configurations
- No new compiler warnings introduced
- Application starts and shows authentication screen
- Dark theme applies correctly
- Manual test of key user scenarios passes

### Manual Testing Scenarios
1. **Application Startup**: Launch app, verify logo loads, authentication screen appears
2. **Authentication**: Click "Sign in with Microsoft", verify browser opens and auth completes
3. **Navigation**: Test switching between Onboarding and Offboarding tabs
4. **Data Loading**: Verify users and licenses load in their respective interfaces
5. **Error Handling**: Test with invalid credentials or network issues

**CRITICAL**: Always test any changes manually since there are no automated tests. The application deals with sensitive Microsoft 365 operations that could impact user accounts if not properly tested.

## Known Issues and Limitations
- **SECURITY**: Azure.Identity package 1.10.4 has moderate severity vulnerabilities (see dotnet restore warnings)
- No unit or integration tests - all validation must be done manually
- Windows-only compatibility - cannot build or run on Linux/macOS
- Requires Microsoft 365 admin permissions for full functionality
- No configuration management - Graph API scopes and settings are hardcoded
- No CI/CD workflows - manual build and deployment only
