# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for AI coding agents working in this repo. Keep this file lean —
only content that **cannot be inferred from the code** belongs here.

## What this is

**baerly-storage** is a vendorless document database that runs over
any S3-compatible storage API. The data lives in your bucket; the
protocol kernel is small enough that an LLM can use the public API
zero-shot from the `.d.ts` files alone. Theoretical foundations live
in [docs/](docs/).

**Current state:** Open source under Apache-2.0, published publicly as
`@gusto/baerly-storage` (and the `@gusto/create-baerly-storage`
scaffolder) on npm (npmjs.com) with `publishConfig.access: "public"`.
See
[`docs/contributing/publishing.md`](docs/contributing/publishing.md) for
the publish workflow.

The protocol kernel and HTTP server are landed. Day-1 templates ship
for Cloudflare Workers and self-hosted Node; both are first-class.
AWS Lambda / Bun / Deno / Fly are an adapter package away.

## Toolchain

- **Package manager:** pnpm (`packageManager: pnpm@11.1.2`).
- **Test runner:** vitest (`vitest run`). Tests import from `"vitest"`.
- **Type checker:** TypeScript 7 / `tsgo` (`@typescript/native-preview`).
- **Formatter:** oxfmt.
- **Linter:** oxlint.
- **Bundler:** rolldown (`rolldown.config.ts`).

Don't introduce alternate tooling without justification.

## Verification

Under Claude Code, `vitest` runs use the compact `minimal` reporter —
vitest 4.1 auto-detects AI-agent environments, and the repo config
(`vitest.config.ts`) additionally pins this behavior when
`CLAUDECODE=1` is set so it isn't silently broken by detection
changes. Failures still print in full. Override with
`--reporter=dot` for long suites (`test:randomize`,
`test:fuzz-maintenance`) when progress signal matters more than
compactness, or `--reporter=default` to force the full reporter.
`pnpm verify` / `pnpm test` is what humans run before pushing. `pnpm
verify` is split into `verify:code` (the whole chain minus markdown) and
`verify:docs` (markdown/mermaid validation); `verify` runs both. The
lefthook pre-commit hook runs them by glob — `verify:code` when a
`.ts`/`.tsx` file is staged, `verify:docs` when a `.md` file is staged
(so a docs-only commit is now validated locally too, and a code-only
commit skips the markdown checks it can't affect) — plus a scoped
`pnpm bundle-sizes` (see below), but NOT the full `pnpm test` suite.
`pnpm verify:agent` / `pnpm test:agent` are explicit compact-output
variants for environments where the env var isn't propagated.

> **Agents: don't pipe `verify:agent` / `test:agent` through `| tail -N` or `| head -N`.** Both scripts are already compact — one finding per line, with full detail preserved on failures. Piping to `tail`/`head` removes the lines you need; if the first run prints nothing useful, the _output is empty because the gate passed_, not because the tail was wrong. Same applies to `pnpm bundle-sizes`.

`pnpm verify` is also enforced as a [lefthook](https://lefthook.dev/)
pre-commit hook (`lefthook.yml`); `pnpm install` wires it up via the
`prepare` script. The hook runs `oxfmt --fix` + `oxlint --fix`, then
`verify:code` (code-globbed) and/or `verify:docs` (markdown-globbed) —
together equivalent to `pnpm verify` on a mixed commit, with neither
running for a commit that stages nothing in its glob — plus
`pnpm bundle-sizes` **only when a
staged file matches `packages/**/_.{ts,tsx}`(excluding`_.test.\*`) or
`rolldown.config.ts`** — bundle budgets live in `pnpm test`/`pnpm bundle-sizes`, NOT in `pnpm verify`, so the scoped hook is what
keeps a budget-blowing kernel edit from committing green and surfacing
late (in CI or a manual `pnpm test`). The hook does **not** run the
full `pnpm test`suite. Bypass with`git commit --no-verify` when needed.

### Test gating

`pnpm test` runs green on a fresh checkout with zero infrastructure
deps. Tests requiring Minio or credentials are gated by env:

- **Minio-required tests** (the `clock behavior` block of
  `tests/integration/time.test.ts`, and the `node-minio` variant of
  `tests/integration/randomized.test.ts`) skip by default. Run them
  with `MINIO=1 pnpm test` (alias: `pnpm test:minio`) after
  `pnpm dev:storage`.
- **`tests/integration/conformance.test.ts`** needs both Minio and
  credentials in `credentials/{aws,gcs,cloudflare}.json` (gitignored).
  Excluded from the default test glob. Run with `pnpm test:conformance`.
- **`tests/integration/export-smoke.test.ts`** needs a local Postgres
  on `127.0.0.1:5433` (provisioned by `pnpm dev:storage`). Excluded
  from the default test glob. Run with `pnpm test:export-smoke`.
- **`packages/adapter-cloudflare/src/r2-binding-storage.conformance.test.ts`**
  runs inside Workerd via the `cloudflare-pool` vitest project
  (`@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers`, miniflare-backed). The R2
  binding `BUCKET` is wired in `vitest.config.ts` and re-published
  on `globalThis.__BAERLY_R2_BINDING__` by `tests/setup/r2-binding.ts`
  so the conformance factory can consume it. Excluded from the
  default project's glob; run with `pnpm test:adapter-cloudflare`
  (the script also sets `ADAPTER_CLOUDFLARE=1` for any future
  in-test conditionals). No external network, no credentials.
- **`packages/adapter-node/src/s3-http.conformance.test.ts`** runs
  against the same local Minio that `pnpm dev:storage` provisions.
  Gated by `MINIO=1` via `describe.runIf`; the bucket
  `baerly-conformance-adapter-node` is auto-created in the suite's
  `beforeAll` (409 BucketAlreadyOwnedByYou is tolerated). Run with
  `pnpm test:adapter-node`, or both adapter suites in sequence
  with `pnpm test:adapters`.
- **`tests/integration/collection-api.test.ts`** drives the locked
  `db.collection(...).{first,all,count,insert,update,replace,delete}`
  surface across three Node-side adapters
  (`memory`, `local-fs`, `node-minio`). `memory` + `local-fs` run by
  default; `node-minio` is gated on `MINIO=1` (via
  `pnpm test:minio`). The Workerd-side `cloudflare-r2` variant lives
  at `packages/adapter-cloudflare/src/collection-api.test.ts` and runs
  under the `cloudflare-pool` vitest project (via
  `pnpm test:adapter-cloudflare`). All variants share the
  backend-agnostic driver in `tests/fixtures/collection-api-cascade.ts`.
- **`tests/integration/maintenance-e2e.test.ts`** is the end-to-end
  durability gate: seeds 5000 entries, runs
  `runScheduledMaintenance` to quiescence, then asserts find()
  parity, bucket-object-count drop, `log_seq_start` advance, and the
  "< 1 Class A op / writer / hour" idle-reader cost-model bound via
  a hand-rolled counting `Storage` proxy. Runs `memory` + `local-fs`
  variants in the default project; `node-minio` and `cloudflare-r2`
  are deferred.

`randomized.test.ts` drives the all-to-all single-key causal-
consistency cascade through `Db` + `Writer` (from
`@baerly/server`) over four storage adapters:

- `memory` — `MemoryStorage`, shared per-bucket via
  `getOrCreateMemoryStorageForBucket`. Default project, no infra,
  runs in <1s on every PR.
- `local-fs` — `LocalFsStorage` over a fresh `mkdtemp` root.
  Default project, no infra, runs in ~1s on every PR.
- `cloudflare-r2` — `r2BindingStorage` over the miniflare R2 binding
  wired by `tests/setup/r2-binding.ts`. Lives at
  `packages/adapter-cloudflare/src/randomized.test.ts` and runs
  under the `cloudflare-pool` vitest project (Workerd). Excluded
  from the default glob; run with `pnpm test:adapter-cloudflare`.
- `node-minio` — `S3HttpStorage` against Toxiproxy → Minio with a
  fault-injection twiddler flipping the proxy every 100 ms. Default
  project, gated on `MINIO=1`; run with `pnpm test:minio`.

The cascade body is shared across projects via
`tests/fixtures/randomized-cascade.ts` (Node-import-free, so it loads
inside Workerd). The Node-side variant table is in
`tests/integration/randomized.test.ts`; the Workerd-side entry is in
`packages/adapter-cloudflare/src/randomized.test.ts`. Each variant
constructs N `Storage` handles sharing the same backing store, then
spins up N `Db` + `Writer` writers all contending on a single
collection log tail / next `log/<seq>` slot.

Pure-unit tests that always pass: `packages/protocol/src/hashing.test.ts`,
`tests/unit/consistency.test.ts`, `packages/protocol/src/xml.test.ts`,
`packages/protocol/src/json.test.ts`,
`packages/protocol/src/log.test.ts`,
`packages/protocol/src/storage/memory.test.ts`,
`packages/adapter-node/src/s3-http.test.ts`,
`packages/dev/src/local-fs.test.ts`,
`tests/unit/datatypes.test.ts`,
`tests/integration/bundle-size.test.ts`,
`tests/integration/log-emit.test.ts`,
`tests/integration/put-all-partial-failure.test.ts`,
`tests/regressions.test.ts`,
`tests/integration/write-amp.test.ts`.
Pattern A/B/C drift across `examples/*/AGENTS.md` is fenced by
`tests/integration/agents-md-drift.test.ts`. The Node example servers'
storage-resolution guard (`examples/{minimal,react}-node/src/server/resolve-storage.ts`)
is unit-tested and kept byte-identical by
`tests/integration/node-storage-resolution.test.ts`.

## Local dev

Integration tests can run against a local Minio + Toxiproxy stack:

```sh
pnpm dev:storage         # docker compose up -d --wait (Minio :9102, Toxiproxy :9104, Postgres :5433)
pnpm dev:storage:stop    # docker compose down
```

> **Two worktrees, two stacks?** Set `BAERLY_MINIO_HOST_PORT`,
> `BAERLY_TOXIPROXY_HOST_PORT`, `BAERLY_TOXIPROXY_ADMIN_PORT`, and
> `BAERLY_POSTGRES_HOST_PORT` in a per-worktree `.env.local` (or just
> inline before the command) and the compose stack will bind those host
> ports instead of the defaults. The test setup helper at
> `tests/setup/ports.ts` reads the same variables, so consumers stay in
> sync. Without overrides the second `compose up` still fails with
> `port already allocated`.

See [docs/contributing/development.md](docs/contributing/development.md) for full setup.

## Module map

Read in this order to build a mental model:

1. `packages/server/src/index.ts` — public barrel; bundler entry
   point. The `@gusto/baerly-storage` npm package is bundled from here.
2. `packages/server/src/db.ts` — the `Db` class. Public read/write
   surface for application code.
3. `packages/server/src/collection.ts`, `packages/server/src/query.ts` —
   `Collection<T>` / `Query<T>` SQL-shape API + predicate AST.
4. `packages/server/src/writer.ts` — `Writer` stateless
   commit path: PUT content → PUT new index entries → create
   `log/<seq>` via `If-None-Match: "*"` (that create IS the commit;
   no `current.json` write on the commit path) → DELETE stale index
   entries after the commit.
5. `packages/server/src/indexes.ts` — `IndexDefinition`, key
   encoding (lex-order-preserving base-32), and per-doc projection
   helpers. Consumed by the writer's hybrid index emission (new
   markers before the committing log create, stale marker deletes
   after it) and by `rebuildIndex`.
6. `packages/server/src/rebuild-index.ts` — `rebuildIndex(storage,
currentJsonKey, def)` idempotent reconciliation; what `baerly
admin rebuild-index` calls.
7. `packages/server/src/compactor.ts`,
   `packages/server/src/gc.ts`,
   `packages/server/src/maintenance.ts` — durability sweep loops.
8. **`@baerly/protocol`** (pure modules; no I/O):
   `packages/protocol/src/json.ts`, `packages/protocol/src/types.ts`,
   `packages/protocol/src/constants.ts`,
   `packages/protocol/src/errors.ts`,
   `packages/protocol/src/hashing.ts`,
   `packages/protocol/src/o-map.ts`,
   `packages/protocol/src/time.ts`,
   `packages/protocol/src/xml.ts`,
   `packages/protocol/src/collection-api.ts` (on-the-wire
   `Collection`/`Query`/`Predicate` contracts),
   `packages/protocol/src/query/` (validate / matches / merge —
   the kernel half of the predicate algebra),
   `packages/protocol/src/storage/` (`Storage` interface +
   `MemoryStorage` only — concrete S3/R2 adapters live in
   `@baerly/adapter-node` / `@baerly/adapter-cloudflare`).
9. **`@baerly/dev`** (Node-only `Storage` impls + dev harness):
   `packages/dev/src/local-fs.ts` (`LocalFsStorage` — directory-tree
   `Storage` with content-addressed ETags and atomic writes; used by
   future `baerly dev` and by tests that need cross-`Db`-instance
   visibility without Minio).
10. **`manual-e2e/`** — manual end-to-end check that drives the
    HTTP conformance cascade + latency / long-poll / 401 probes
    against real R2 / real S3. Each subdir now holds only its
    `e2e.test.ts`; the deploy artifacts are the production scaffolds
    `examples/minimal-cloudflare` (via `pnpm baerly deploy`) and
    `examples/minimal-node --with=docker` (via `docker build && docker
run`). Manual lifecycle in `manual-e2e/README.md`; driven by
    `pnpm test:manual-e2e`. Sits at the root alongside `bench/`
    because it's manual maintainer infrastructure, not part of the
    automated test suite.
11. **`examples/`** — runnable example apps that double as the CLI
    template source. `examples/minimal-cloudflare/` (R2 +
    `cloudflareAccess`→`sharedSecret`), `examples/minimal-node/`
    (S3 + JWKS→`sharedSecret`, any host that runs `node server.js`),
    `examples/react-cloudflare/` (full React + Vite SPA over a
    `NoteSchema` collection; dev uses workerd-in-Vite via
    `@cloudflare/vite-plugin` + `baerlyDevAuth` from
    `@gusto/baerly-storage/dev/vite`), and `examples/react-node/` (same SPA +
    `NoteSchema`; dev uses `baerlyDev()` from `@gusto/baerly-storage/dev/vite`
    over `LocalFsStorage` as a single-Vite-process middleware) are the
    production-shaped scaffolds. Each scaffoldable example carries
    a `.baerly/scaffold.json` manifest declaring rename sentinels,
    copy exclusions, and devDep drops. The CLI consumes them at
    scaffold time via `STARTER_TO_EXAMPLE` in
    `packages/create-baerly-storage/src/scaffold.ts`; the rolldown build
    copies them into `dist/templates/<name>/` so the published
    `@gusto/create-baerly-storage` binary is self-contained.
    Opt-in add-ons live alongside the examples at
    `packages/create-baerly-storage/templates/addons/<name>/` (today: just
    `docker/` — Dockerfile + healthcheck.js + .dockerignore). The
    scaffolder layers an add-on on top of the base template when
    `--with=<name>` is passed (Docker requires `--target=node`).
    `rolldown.config.ts` mirrors `templates/addons/` into
    `dist/templates/addons/` so the published binary ships them too.
    Catalog index in `examples/README.md`. See `packages/create-baerly-storage/AGENTS.md` for the full scaffold pipeline (examples → dist/templates → tgz → user dir).

The full lifecycle of `db.collection().insert()` is in
[docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) — read it before
changing `packages/server/src/writer.ts` or the query
evaluation path. architecture.md also has a Mermaid dependency
graph if you need finer-grained roles than the groups above.

## Conventions

- **Imports are relative, with explicit `.ts`/`.tsx` extensions.**
  `tsconfig.json` uses `moduleResolution: "bundler"` and no `baseUrl`.
  Inside `packages/server/src/` write
  `import { UUID } from "@baerly/protocol"` for cross-package types
  and `import { makeCollection } from "./collection.ts"` for siblings. The
  `.ts` extension is required so that Node's native
  `--experimental-strip-types` runtime — used by the
  `examples/minimal-node/` and `examples/react-node/` scaffolds,
  which consume the workspace `exports."."` → `./src/*.ts` paths
  directly — can resolve relative specifiers. Enforced by
  `oxlint`'s `import/extensions: ["error", "always", { ignorePackages: true }]`
  on `packages/**` + `tests/**`, and by `scripts/add-ts-extensions.mjs --check`
  on the paths oxlint doesn't lint (`bench/`, `deploy/`, `examples/`,
  `scripts/`, root `*.config.ts`).
- **Branded types are load-bearing.** `UUID` and `ContentVersionId`
  exist to prevent confusion bugs. Don't paper over a type
  mismatch with `as string`; widen only if you understand why.
- **Magic values live in `packages/protocol/src/constants.ts`** with a JSDoc citing where the
  value comes from (often `docs/spec/sync-protocol.md`).
- **Errors must be `BaerlyError` instances** (re-exported from
  `@baerly/protocol`). Use the `code` discriminant
  (`error.code === "NetworkError"`), not `instanceof` chains. Hierarchy
  lives in `packages/protocol/src/errors.ts`.
- **Tests use vitest.** `import { describe, test, it, expect } from "vitest"`.
  Don't add jest, mocha, or `bun:test`.
- **Public API docs live as JSDoc on `packages/server/src/db.ts` and
  `packages/server/src/table.ts`.** IDE hover and tsgo consume them
  directly — no rendered markdown ref to maintain.
- **Per-collection linearizability is a hard invariant.** The
  `log/<seq>` `If-None-Match: "*"` create linearizes each collection;
  cross-collection writes are unordered and non-atomic.
  [docs/spec/sync-protocol.md](docs/spec/sync-protocol.md)
  and [docs/spec/causal-consistency-checking.md](docs/spec/causal-consistency-checking.md)
  describe how it works. Read those before touching
  `packages/server/src/writer.ts`.

## Anti-patterns

- ❌ Adding **runtime** dependencies to anything that ships to user
  apps. The runtime footprint of `baerly-storage` and the adapters
  is intentionally small (`aws4fetch`, `@rgrove/parse-xml`, `hono`,
  `jose`); every additional dep widens the kernel bundle
  and the audit surface for users. Justify any addition.
- ✅ **Build-time / CLI / dev-tooling deps are fair game.** Inside
  `packages/create-baerly-storage/`, `packages/cli/`, `packages/dev/`,
  `bench/`, `manual-e2e/`, `scripts/`, and `examples/*/devDependencies`,
  prefer a well-maintained dep over reinventing it in-house. None
  of this code ends up in a user's production bundle, so the
  trade-off flips: the cost is one more line in our lockfile, the
  benefit is less undifferentiated heavy lifting we own forever.
  Examples worth reaching for here: `@clack/prompts`,
  `nypm`, `citty`. Still pick maintained, narrow,
  ESM-friendly packages — but the default answer is "yes, take the
  dep" rather than "justify it."
- ❌ Widening a branded type to its base (`as string`, `as number`).
- ❌ Skipping or `.skip()`'ing a test to ship. If a test is wrong, fix it;
  if the code is wrong, fix the code.
- ❌ Hard-coding new magic numbers. Add to `packages/protocol/src/constants.ts`.
- ❌ Trimming JSDoc, comments, or error-message text to squeeze under the
  **raw/gz bundle-size budget**. Those two axes are creep _tripwires_; `min-gz`
  is the only hard ceiling (it's the real shipped-to-browser cost — see the
  `POLICY` note in `tests/integration/bundle-size.test.ts`, which the failing
  assertion now also prints). On an intentional change, rebaseline the KiB line
  with a dated baseline note — don't golf docs/identifiers/messages. Comments
  ship un-stripped, but doc + error quality outweigh a few raw bytes. (An axis
  over on `min-gz` is different: that's a real regression — shrink the closure,
  don't rebaseline.)
- ❌ Reintroducing `bun:test`, Rome, or baseUrl imports — all replaced.
- ❌ Extensionless relative imports (`from "./foo"`). Always write
  `from "./foo.ts"` or `from "./foo/index.ts"`. Node's
  strip-types runtime can't resolve them; oxlint's
  `import/extensions` rule fails the lint.
- ❌ Calling `vitest` via `pnpm exec vitest` or `./node_modules/.bin/vitest` —
  both skip the `pretest` hook (`pnpm run build`), leaving `dist/` empty or
  stale and producing spurious failures in bundle-size / dist-consuming tests.
  Use `pnpm test:agent` or `pnpm bundle-sizes` (whose script self-builds).
  Same idea for the other tools: prefer `pnpm verify:agent` / `pnpm build`
  over `pnpm exec tsgo` / `pnpm exec rolldown` so the canonical flags
  (`--pretty false`, `--format=unix --quiet`, etc.) come along.
- ❌ Proposing maintenance/cleanup/coordination mechanisms that require
  _operator-installed_ scheduling (`wrangler.jsonc` `triggers.crons`,
  `node-cron`, k8s `CronJob`, systemd timer, DO Alarms). The kernel must
  work on a bare bucket with zero operator infrastructure — the pitch is
  "Just a Bucket" (thesis criterion #6, [thesis.md](docs/about/thesis.md#what-apps-within-the-envelope-need)).
  Scheduled cron is a _user-opt-in_ acceleration via the exported
  `runScheduledMaintenance` SDK, never a default and never a requirement.
  **In-band write-tick maintenance is the sanctioned default and it
  SATISFIES this doctrine** (zero operator infrastructure): writes
  opportunistically tick — a budgeted `runGc` slice, then a go/no-go
  fold bounded by a static two-way snapshot ceiling (`C` bytes AND `E`
  rows); Cloudflare relocates the fold past the response via
  `ctx.waitUntil`, everywhere else runs inline. **Reads are pure — they
  never tick.** No timer, no `setInterval`, no sweep thread, no lease, no
  environment-divergent behavior, no operator cron, no app-plane knob —
  the only operator surface is the `BAERLY_MAINTENANCE_*` env vars read
  by the adapters. `runBoundedMaintenance`
  (`packages/server/src/maintenance.ts`) is the runner; the in-band tick
  and the opt-in `runScheduledMaintenance` are the two maintenance
  triggers that exist. The anti-pattern below still stands — don't
  require _operator-installed_ scheduling; in-band is the sanctioned
  shape that needs none. Anti-precedent:
  Cassandra's `read_repair_chance` (removed in 4.0,
  [CASSANDRA-13910](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-13910)) —
  unbounded probabilistic on-request maintenance is harmful; bounded under
  a per-pass CPU budget (PostgreSQL HOT pruning precedent) is the safe
  shape. Use the operator-burden test at
  [docs/contributing/conventions/change-discipline.md](docs/contributing/conventions/change-discipline.md#operator-burden-test-for-new-mechanisms)
  before proposing any new background-work mechanism.

## Scope guidance

- **Bugfix?** Reproduce with a failing test first. Pick the right test file
  by topic (`json.test.ts`, `time.test.ts`, etc.).
- **New public API method on `Db` / `Collection`?** See [docs/contributing/extending.md](docs/contributing/extending.md).
  Add JSDoc with `@example` — IDEs and tsgo consume it directly.
- **Touching the sync protocol?** Read `docs/spec/sync-protocol.md` and
  `docs/spec/causal-consistency-checking.md`. Add a property-based test in
  `tests/integration/randomized.test.ts` or a check in
  `tests/unit/consistency.test.ts`.
- **Performance change?** Run `pnpm test:randomize` for a few minutes.
  Randomized tests catch races the conformance suite misses.
- **Scoping from an inbound brief / gap report?** Verify each cited
  file:line and each named feature with `grep` / `Read` before
  drafting tickets. Inbound briefs can hallucinate file paths,
  miscount the API surface, or claim missing features that already
  exist. ~10 minutes of verification up front beats hours of work
  stuck on phantom references.
