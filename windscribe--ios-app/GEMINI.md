# AGENTS.md

Operating notes for AI agents working in this repo. Humans want `README.md`.

## TL;DR

Windscribe iOS/tvOS VPN client. Multi-target Xcode project (no workspace, no Tuist). The codebase is **mid-migration**: UIKit+Combine+Swinject+Realm is the current shore, SwiftUI+async/await+constructor-injection+GRDB is the far shore. **When you touch existing code, match its style. When you write new code, steer toward the target state** — see [Modernization direction](#modernization-direction) below.

Do not mass-migrate existing screens. The UI is being rebuilt screen-by-screen; out-of-band rewrites create merge pain.

## Project Neo / v5.0 — AI agent onramp

If you're picking up Project Neo work, **read these in order before doing anything else**:

1. [`docs/PROJECT_NEO.md`](docs/PROJECT_NEO.md) — the rule sheet (non-negotiable rules for new code, branching strategy, "adding a new feature" walkthrough).
2. [`docs/neo/DECISIONS.md`](docs/neo/DECISIONS.md) — the architectural decision log. Every decision the team has settled on, with rationale.
3. [`docs/neo/STATE.md`](docs/neo/STATE.md) — the execution log. Read from the bottom to answer "where are we right now?".
4. [`docs/neo/plans/00-roadmap.md`](docs/neo/plans/00-roadmap.md) — the umbrella roadmap (M0–M10).
5. The relevant per-issue plan in [`docs/neo/plans/M<N>-*.md`](docs/neo/plans/) for the issue you're touching.

**Decisions and per-issue plans belong in tree, not in any agent's private memory.** Project Neo is multi-contributor and multi-agent; each teammate runs their own AI assistant with its own private memory. The only context every agent shares is what's in the repo. If you settled an architectural question or shipped a milestone, write it down in `DECISIONS.md` / `STATE.md` as part of the same PR — not in chat history, not in agent memory.

## Build & test

Build and test through Xcode or `xcodebuild` / `fastlane`. If you are running under a harness that exposes an Xcode MCP server (tool names like `BuildProject`, `RunAllTests`, `RunSomeTests`), prefer those — otherwise use the standard Xcode tooling. Schemes:

- `Windscribe-Debug` — main iOS scheme for development
- `Windscribe-Staging` / `Windscribe-Release` — staging/prod configurations
- `WindscribeTV-Debug` / `-Staging` / `-Release` — tvOS
- `WindscribeTests` — unit tests (CI runs on `iPhone 16 Pro`)

Signing lives in `Windscribe/Environments/Config.xcconfig`. Don't commit personal signing values — override locally.

## Core architectural facts

### Dependency injection — Swinject

Everything non-trivial is resolved through `Swinject`. Entry point is `Assembler.resolve(T.self)`.

- `CoreModule` → services shared with the Network Extensions (logger, WSNet, preferences, keychain)
- `UserScope` → rebuilt on login/logout
- `AppModules/iOS/` → iOS-app-only registrations (view models, routers, view controllers)
- Extensions (`PacketTunnel`, `WireGuardTunnel`) build their own `Container` and call `container.injectCore(ext: true)` — they cannot reach into the host app's DI graph at runtime.

When adding a new service: register in the correct module (is it shared with extensions? does it depend on session?), depend on the protocol, never on the impl.

### Persistence — Realm (today) / GRDB (target)

`Windscribe/Data/Database/LocalDatabase.swift` defines the app's DB contract. The impl wraps Realm and exposes `AnyPublisher<…>` streams for observation. Don't import `RealmSwift` outside of `Data/Database/` — views and VMs consume the `LocalDatabase` protocol so the storage engine can be swapped.

### Networking — WSNet

The API layer is a thin Swift wrapper over the vendored `WSNet.xcframework` (C++). Use `APIManager` / `APIManagerImpl+*` — they expose modern `async throws` methods and take care of retries, session refresh, and the Robert/Emergency/Bridge sub-APIs. `WSNet Protocol/` contains the low-level bindings; avoid reaching into them unless you're adding a new endpoint family.

### VPN stack

Three tunnel protocols, split across two Network Extension targets:

- `PacketTunnel/` — OpenVPN (via `OpenVPNAdapter`) and IKEv2 (via `NEVPNProtocolIKEv2`). Stealth and WStunnel are OpenVPN with obfuscation layers handled inside WSNet.
- `WireGuardTunnel/` — WireGuard and AmneziaWG, via `amneziawg-apple` (our fork) and the Go user-space bridge in `wireguard-go-bridge/`.

Tunnel selection and lifecycle live in `Managers/VPN/` and `Repository/VPN State/`. The `Managers/Protocols/` directory contains a small VPN-related protocol namespace — don't confuse it with Swift `protocol` files.

### Navigation

- Older UIKit screens use `Router/` coordinators (`HomeRouter`, `AccountRouter`, etc.) — each router wraps a `UINavigationController`.
- Newer SwiftUI screens use `Router/NavigationRouter/` which provides a `BaseNavigationRouter` + `NavigationRouterModifier` for `NavigationStack`-based flows.

### App extensions

| Target | Framework | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `HomeWidget` | WidgetKit (SwiftUI) | Imports `Swinject` + `ContainerResolver` to access app services |
| `AppIntents` | AppIntents (iOS 16+) | `ShortcutProvider` declares the public Shortcut phrases |
| `SiriIntents` | SiriKit (legacy) | Being phased out in favor of `AppIntents` |
| `PacketTunnel` | NetworkExtension | OpenVPN / IKEv2 |
| `WireGuardTunnel` | NetworkExtension | WireGuard / AmneziaWG |

All five share the `group.com.windscribe.vpn` App Group for IPC via `UserDefaults` and file storage.

### Localization

28 `.lproj` directories across the app, widget, and SiriIntents targets. Source strings live in `Windscribe/Supporting Files/Localization/`. Don't hard-code user-visible strings — add a key and localize it.

## Conventions

### Code style

- **Named constants over magic strings.** Use `Fields.Values.auto`, not `"Auto"`. Don't rewrite named constants into literals.
- **Images via the `ImagesAsset` enum** (`UIConstants+ImagesAsset.swift`). Never `Image("name")` or `UIImage(named: "name")` with a raw string.
- **Force-unwraps after nil checks are acceptable.** Don't over-guard.
- **Avoid SwiftUI `Group`** — use `@ViewBuilder` or the appropriate stack instead. The project is on Swift 5.9+, so there is no 10-view `@ViewBuilder` limit to worry about.
- **Place new constants at the end of their group**, not in the middle — keeps diffs clean.
- **SwiftLint** is authoritative; see `.swiftlint.yml` for the enabled ruleset. Don't disable rules without a review.
- **Release cadence is deliberate.** A migration or gated change must work on the first try in production — build runtime safety nets, don't rely on a quick follow-up release.

### MVVM + protocols (existing code)

```
UIKit VC or SwiftUI View  ⇄  ViewModel (ObservableObject / @Published)  ⇄  Service protocol  ⇄  Impl (registered in Swinject)
```

- View models are protocols; the impl is registered in `AppModulesViewModels.swift`.
- Services are protocols; impls are registered in `CoreModule.swift` or the relevant module.
- View models do not import SwiftUI. They should be testable as plain Swift.

### Testing

- Current tests use **XCTest** and live in `WindscribeTests/`. Mocks are hand-rolled in `WindscribeTests/Mocks/`.
- New tests may use the **Swift Testing** framework (`import Testing`, `@Test`, `#expect`). Prefer it for brand-new test files; don't rewrite existing XCTest files just to change framework.
- Do **not** mock the database in integration-style tests for DB-adjacent features. Mocked DB layers have historically diverged from real Realm/GRDB behavior, masking migration and threading bugs. Use a real in-memory or scratch DB instead.

## Modernization direction

The app is moving to an iOS 18 floor with a full UI rebuild. **When you write new code, write it in the modern style even if the surrounding code is legacy.** This keeps the eventual flip painless.

**Canonical reference module:** [`Windscribe/Features/About/`](Windscribe/Features/About/) — the M0 PR 3 reference (per ND-005). Copy this when starting a new feature: it demonstrates `@Observable` + `@MainActor` view model, protocol-injected services via `@Environment(@Entry)`, async/await + `AsyncStream` over a Combine subject at the legacy boundary, and Swift Testing. The accompanying protocol seed lives in [`Windscribe/Services/Protocols/`](Windscribe/Services/Protocols/), the environment composition root in [`Windscribe/App/Environment+Dependencies.swift`](Windscribe/App/Environment+Dependencies.swift), and the test pattern in [`WindscribeTests/Features/AboutTests.swift`](WindscribeTests/Features/AboutTests.swift).

| Layer | Legacy (current, in tree) | Modern (target, for new code) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| UI | UIKit + SnapKit | SwiftUI; UIKit only with a documented reason |
| Async | Combine, completion handlers | `async/await`, `AsyncStream`, `TaskGroup` |
| DI | Swinject (`Assembler.resolve`) | Constructor injection + SwiftUI `@Environment` |
| Observation | `ObservableObject` + `@Published` | `@Observable` macro |
| Persistence | Realm (`RealmSwift`) | GRDB (`FetchableRecord` / `PersistableRecord` structs, `ValueObservation`) |
| Sync primitives | `DispatchQueue` for locking | `actor`; `Mutex` / `Atomic` from `Synchronization` where `await` isn't viable |
| Navigation | UIKit `Router` coordinators | `NavigationStack` + `NavigationPath` |
| Tests | XCTest | Swift Testing (`#expect`, `@Test`, parameterized) |
| Language mode | Swift 5 | Swift 5 with `StrictConcurrency = targeted` → module-by-module to Swift 6 |

**Swift 6-ready patterns, usable today in Swift 5:**

- `@MainActor` on view models explicitly (even under SwiftUI's implicit main isolation).
- Mark `Sendable` where a type crosses isolation boundaries. Avoid `@unchecked Sendable` — if forced, add a comment explaining why.
- Use `actor` for mutable shared state. No new `DispatchQueue`-based locking.
- Convert Combine publisher APIs at the boundary with `.values` to `AsyncSequence`.
- Typed error enums per domain; no bare `Error` / `NSError` in new public APIs.

**Hard rules for new code:**

1. No new `RxSwift` — already fully removed from the codebase. Do not reintroduce.
2. No new `Combine` usage. Convert at Apple-API boundaries with `.values`.
3. No new `Swinject` registrations in greenfield modules. Prefer init-injected protocols. (Existing modules stay on Swinject until rewritten.)
4. No new `ObservableObject` / `@Published` / `@StateObject` / `@ObservedObject`. Use `@Observable` + `@State` + `@Bindable`.
5. No new UIKit screens. SwiftUI first; UIKit wrapping only with a justification comment.
6. No new Realm `Object` subclasses. New persistence goes through a protocol-defined store; back it with GRDB.
7. One tunnel configuration path. Don't add `if #available(iOS 16, *)` guards in new tunnel code — the minimum deployment target is moving to iOS 18.
8. View models don't import SwiftUI.

**When editing legacy code:** match the surrounding style. Don't rewrite a UIKit controller to SwiftUI mid-feature unless that rewrite *is* the task.

## Agent workflow rules

- For UI tasks, **focus on View/ViewModel**. Skip API/wsnet exploration unless the task explicitly involves it.
- For SwiftUI errors, **research before fixing** — don't guess. The project uses modern Swift with no `@ViewBuilder` view-count limit.
- **Suggest least-invasive solutions first.** CI/build-time overrides beat project-file mutations. Only open `project.pbxproj` as a last resort.
- **Only implement what's asked.** Don't start "next phase" work proactively; surface it as a follow-up instead.
- **Build verification is cheap** — build the affected scheme after non-trivial changes. Don't claim a task is done without confirming it builds.
