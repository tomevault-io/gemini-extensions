# AGENTS.md

This file is the single source of truth for repository-specific agent instructions.
`CLAUDE.md` must only point here. If any other instruction file disagrees with this file, follow `AGENTS.md`.

## 1. Working Agreement

- Make minimal, correct, production-ready changes. Avoid over-engineering.
- Prefer simple modules, low cyclomatic complexity, and reusable logic.
- Check existing patterns before adding new abstractions.
- Keep user-visible behavior complete. Do not leave mock data, placeholder flows, or half-finished paths.
- When documentation in this file conflicts with the codebase, verify the codebase and update the documentation to match reality.

## 5. Engineering Rules

### TypeScript and module design

- Keep types explicit and strict. Do not introduce `any`.
- Prefer small focused modules over large files.
- Reuse existing components and utilities before creating new ones.
- Follow repository naming patterns:
  - Components: PascalCase
  - Functions and variables: camelCase
- Keep code readable without clever indirection. If a pattern needs a long explanation, it is probably too complex.

### Next.js and React

- Default to Server Components. Add Client Components only when interactivity or browser APIs require them.
- Push `"use client"` down to the smallest interactive leaf.
- Follow App Router conventions for pages, layouts, route handlers, and colocated `_components`.
- Use real implementations. Do not ship fake data, fake success states, or dead-end UI.
- Add page metadata where appropriate.

### Layout and page width

- Use the semantic containers from `src/components/layout/page-container.tsx` instead of page-local `max-w-*` wrappers when working outside the dashboard.
- Use `ShellContainer` for global chrome and genuinely wide split layouts such as the marketing header, footer, and homepage hero.
- Use `SectionContainer` for standard marketing sections and most non-dashboard page bodies.
- Use `ReadingContainer` for article content, legal copy, and other long-form reading surfaces.
- Use `CompactContainer` for narrow auth flows.
- Use `FocusContainer` for status pages and single-card flows that need more space.
- Treat full-bleed backgrounds and content width as separate concerns: a section may span the viewport, but its content should still sit inside one semantic container.
- Do not add new ad hoc width systems or scatter `max-w-*` utilities through page modules unless a one-off component truly cannot be expressed with the existing containers.

### Forms and validation

- Use React Hook Form with Zod for form validation.
- Keep schemas close to the form or in a clearly named schema module.
- Handle loading, validation, and error states explicitly.

## 6. Localization and Lingo

### Core policy

- Do not hardcode user-visible language in code. Use the repository's Lingo-based i18n flow.
- Treat free-form business data such as `banReason` as raw content. It does not need translation, but any surrounding UI copy still must follow i18n rules.
- Source copy should be authored in English unless a feature explicitly requires a different canonical source language.
- Shipped UI must respect the active locale and must not mix English with translated copy in the same view.

### Source of truth for locale behavior

- Keep locale detection and persistence in `src/.lingo/locale-resolver.server.ts` and `src/.lingo/locale-resolver.client.ts`.
- In server code, read request locale through `src/lib/i18n/server-locale.ts`.
- For client-side locale switching, prefer `useLingoContext().setLocale()` for same-route updates.
- If a locale switch must change the URL for locale-prefixed marketing routes, use canonical `href`s, persist locale, and let the browser navigate.
- For numbers and dates, format with the active locale via helpers such as `resolveIntlLocale`. Do not hardcode `en-US`.

### Extraction rules

- Lingo only extracts localizable copy from `.tsx` and `.jsx`.
- Keep translatable copy directly in the JSX render tree.
- Allowed localizable patterns include:
  - JSX text nodes and fragments
  - String literal JSX attributes such as `placeholder`, `alt`, `aria-label`, `title`, and `label`
  - JSX text combined with expressions
- Avoid storing translatable copy in module-level strings, template literals, object maps, or helper-returned string tables.
- Do not branch translated copy with runtime locale conditionals such as `locale === "zh-Hans" ? "..." : "..."`.
- Prefer small JSX subcomponents for reusable copy instead of exported string maps.
- If a piece of copy is only used once or can be expressed directly at the call site, inline the JSX instead of wrapping it in a no-props helper component.
- Default pattern for one-off marketing sections, cards, checklists, and similar page-local UI: define the data array inside the rendering component and place the localized JSX directly on each item, as in `title: <>...</>` and `description: <>...</>`.
- If the structure must stay at module scope or be shared across multiple render sites, keep the structural data minimal, then map a stable id to localized JSX in one small leaf component or local `switch`.
- Inline JSX is only a safe default when it is created inside the component render path. Do not hoist localizable `ReactNode` fragments into module-level config arrays, objects, or other top-level constants and expect Lingo to extract them reliably.
- For structured UI config such as sidebar navigation, dropdown items, and card definitions, either build the config inside the rendering component with inline JSX there, or use a small JSX subcomponent when the config must stay at module scope.
- Do not introduce `defineCopyCatalog`, `Label` factories, or module-scope `Title`/`Description` component registries for page-local marketing copy or small finite state labels unless the config truly must live outside the render path.
- Prefer full-sentence JSX branches over concatenation such as `"More "`, `file(s)`, or mixed translated and untranslated fragments.
- When a reusable component needs copy-bearing props such as titles, descriptions, empty states, or placeholders, prefer accepting JSX-friendly inputs at the call site and only coerce to plain strings at the final DOM or library boundary when required.
- For fallback labels like anonymous authors, empty states, and button text, keep the fallback copy in JSX instead of `value || "..."` when the text is user-visible and localizable.
- Avoid IIFEs or nested callback structures that hide localizable JSX from extraction when a small subcomponent would be clearer.
- When content must stay unlocalized, use supported patterns such as `data-lingo-skip` as an attribute, not in `className`.
- For small finite UI state sets such as auth feedback, payment status, and simple badges, prefer a single render-path component with a local `switch` over many zero-logic helper components that only `return <>...</>`.
- Use module-scope label components only when structured config must stay at module scope for composition; if the copy is consumed in one place, render it inline or in one small leaf component instead of building `ReactNode` factories.
- Prefer controlled UI message codes over raw strings in state for transient feedback such as payment status errors and checkout results; render the final localized message in JSX at the boundary.
- Never pass raw external error text such as URL query descriptions straight to the UI. Normalize external states to an allowlisted key and render a controlled localized fallback in JSX.

### Lingo integration constraints

- Do not invent `useTranslation`, `FormattedMessage`, `localizeText`, or similar patterns.
- Do not manually implement a parallel i18n system beside Lingo.
- Keep `LingoProvider` at the root layout. Do not convert large trees to client components only to read locale.
- For `generateMetadata`, return a metadata object literal directly from the route module when any localizable fields are involved. Do not wrap translatable metadata in helpers such as `createPageMetadata`, and if shared defaults are needed, spread only non-localizable metadata into the returned object while keeping `title`, `description`, and other translated fields visible in that object literal.
- Real translation QA must use a production build: run `pnpm build` and `pnpm start`.

## 7. Data, Billing, and Security

- Validate environment variables only through `env.js`.
- Keep server and client environment variables separated and validated.
- Preserve the billing provider abstraction. Route payment behavior through `src/lib/billing/provider.ts`.
- Follow existing upload security flow in `src/lib/config/upload.ts` and related server logic.
- Keep webhook handling idempotent and validation-first.
- Do not bypass existing auth, permission, or validation boundaries.

## 8. Database Workflow

- Maintain a single committed migration history in `src/database/migrations`.
- Use `pnpm db:push` only for fast local iteration against disposable or personal development databases.
- Use `pnpm db:generate` to create migration files that will be committed and shared across staging and production.
- Use `pnpm db:migrate` to apply committed migrations to whichever database is selected by `DATABASE_URL`.
- Do not split migration history by environment. Environment differences belong in deployment configuration, not in separate SQL trees.
- In CI/CD, run migrations as a dedicated one-shot release step, not on every app process startup.
- Keep schema, queries, and types aligned when data models change.

## 9. Testing and Verification

- After every meaningful change, run the narrowest relevant checks first, then the broader project checks.
- Minimum expectation for code changes:
  - `pnpm lint`
  - `pnpm type-check`
- Run `pnpm test` when logic, state handling, routing, validation, billing, auth, or i18n behavior changes.
- Run `pnpm build` when changing app structure, configuration, localization behavior, or anything that could affect production compilation.
- Do not mark work complete without reporting what was verified and what was not.

## 10. Commit Policy

- When a change touches Lingo outputs, always commit Lingo cache and language files together in the same commit.
- Required include: `src/.lingo/cache/*` and related locale/language output files generated by Lingo.
