# GitHub Copilot Instructions for Tennis Club Connect

A static React + Leaflet app bundled with esbuild. NOTE: the project was moved from an `app/` subfolder into the repository root; some legacy references may still mention `app/`. Data and images now live under `assets/data/` and `images/` at the repository root. This guide sets the rules and workflows for AI-assisted edits to keep the site fast, safe, and maintainable.

## Architecture
- UI: React 18 functional components in `src/app.jsx`, bundled to `app.js` (IIFE, minified, ES2018 target).
- Map: Leaflet for markers, popups, and bounds fitting.
- Styling: Tailwind utility classes in JSX. No custom CSS build.
- Data: Base64 JSON (`assets/data/rk7a9nq3.b64.txt`) loaded by `rk7a9nq3.js` hydrates global data at runtime. When you update `assets/data/clubs.json` regenerate the base64 bundle with `node scripts/extract-b64.js assets/data/rk7a9nq3.b64.txt` and commit the resulting file.
- Images: All logos/icons are local for privacy. No runtime remote favicon fetching.
- SW: `app/sw.js` caches the shell and images. Bump cache version on asset changes.
- Optional backend: Netlify function `netlify/functions/suggest-club.js` and local Express helper `app/server/send-suggestion.js` for suggestions.

## Golden rules
- Edit source only: Make changes in `src/app.jsx`. Never edit the compiled bundle `app.js` (or legacy `app/app.js`) directly.
- Keep it small: Favor light, incremental changes. Preserve public behavior unless the task requires it.
- Mobile-first: Ensure inputs/buttons remain touch-friendly. On iOS small screens, popover filter inputs can be slightly taller.
- Privacy first: Don’t add third-party trackers or external data fetches. Keep all assets local unless explicitly requested.
- Determinism: Avoid non-deterministic behavior (no time-based randomization). Prefer predictable outputs.

## Build and run
- Install: `npm install` (esbuild + React only)
- Build: `npm run build` (bundles `src/app.jsx` into `app.js`)
- Dev server: `npm start` then open `http://localhost:3000/search/` or `search/index.html` depending on workspace
- Do NOT introduce new build tools unless requested. Stick with esbuild.

## Data workflows
- Data workflows
- Editing clubs: Update `assets/data/clubs.json`. After editing, run BOTH regeneration steps and commit all three changed files — the page loads `assets/data/rk7a9nq3.js` at runtime, so both files must be updated:

  1. `node scripts/extract-b64.js assets/data/rk7a9nq3.b64.txt`   ← updates the raw b64 file
  2. `node scripts/inline-data.js`                                  ← regenerates the JS bundle the browser actually loads
  3. `git add assets/data/clubs.json assets/data/rk7a9nq3.b64.txt assets/data/rk7a9nq3.js`
  4. `git commit -m "data: update clubs and regenerate base64 bundle"`

  **Important:** Running only step 1 (extract-b64) is NOT enough — `rk7a9nq3.js` is what the page fetches and it will stay stale until `inline-data.js` is also run. Missing step 2 is why new clubs appear in the JSON but are invisible in the UI.

  Optional verification: decode the regenerated bundle and search for your edited entry to confirm the change is present, for example:

  - `base64 --decode assets/data/rk7a9nq3.b64.txt | grep -C2 "Galway Lawn Tennis Club"`
  - or using Node: `node -e "console.log(Buffer.from(require('fs').readFileSync('assets/data/rk7a9nq3.b64.txt','utf8'),'base64').toString('utf8').includes('Artificial Clay'))"`

  This prevents discrepancies between the JSON source and the base64 bundle used by the site.
- Audits:
  - Logos: `npm run audit:logos` to report missing/unused logos.
  - Images: `npm run audit:images` to find large files and compression candidates.
- Sorting: Dataset loads with a one-time alphabetical sort; still add entries in alphabetical order where practical to keep diffs small.
- No rebuild needed for pure data edits. Rebuild only when `src/` changes.

## UI conventions
- Tailwind classes for spacing/typography. Keep vertical paddings sensible:
  - Global search input: compact by default (e.g., `py-2 md:py-1.5`).
  - Mobile filter popover (iOS small screens): allow slightly taller inputs for better touch targets.
- Accessibility: Ensure labels, roles, focus management, and alt text are present. Don’t rely on color alone.
- Performance: Re-create markers only when filters change. Avoid heavy re-renders.

## Map and tiles
- Use OSM/CARTO by default. If `MAPTILER_KEY` is set in `app/config.js`, use MapTiler with `MAPTILER_STYLE`.
- Don’t ship secrets. Keep keys empty in committed files.

## Service worker
- If you change static assets, bump the cache name in `app/sw.js` (e.g., `tcm-assets-v3` → `tcm-assets-v4`) and verify `install/activate` handlers update caches.

## Netlify function (optional)
- `netlify/functions/suggest-club.js`: Validates and forwards suggestion emails. Keep strict input validation and rate limiting where added.

## PR scope & checklist
- Narrow, well-described changes. Include why and user impact.
- Source changes only in `app/src/app.jsx` unless adjusting data or images.
- Build locally: `npm run build` and confirm `app/app.js` updates reflect your source changes.
- Test locally: open search page; verify filters, map markers, and popovers work.
- If assets changed, update SW cache version.
- Run audits when touching images/logos.
- No unrelated refactors or formatting churn.

## Don’ts
- Don’t edit `app/app.js` directly.
- Don’t add new dependencies or heavy frameworks without explicit approval.
- Don’t fetch external favicons or third-party APIs at runtime.
- Don’t degrade mobile touch targets or accessibility.

## Common pitfalls
- Forgetting to rebuild after changing `src/`.
- Modifying minified bundle instead of source.
- Breaking small-screen layouts; always check iOS touch targets.
- Changing dataset without updating local logos/images.

## Quick references
- Source: `src/app.jsx`
- Bundle: `app.js` (generated)
- Search page: `search/index.html` (root `search/`)
- Landing page: `index.html`
- Data: `assets/data/`
- Images: `images/`
- Components: `components.js`
- SW: `sw.js`
- Scripts: `scripts/`
- Netlify functions: `netlify/functions/`

Deployment notes (avoid 405 / missing function issues):

- Ensure `netlify.toml` (or your host settings) points `publish` to the repository root (or the correct publish directory) and `functions` to `netlify/functions`. Example:

  [build]
    publish = "."
    functions = "netlify/functions"

- If using `_redirects`, include both `/api/your-fn` and `/api/your-fn/` (trailing-slash variant) to avoid redirects that transform POSTs into GETs and strip request bodies.

- After changing deploy config, trigger a fresh deploy and verify the function endpoint responds to `POST` with `200` before assuming client-side issues.

If you need broader architectural changes or a new feature, propose a brief plan in the PR description before implementation. Keep performance and privacy top-of-mind.
