# CLAUDE.md

Instructions for Claude (or any AI assistant) operating inside this repository.

This file is the equivalent of `AGENTS.md` (which Codex reads) but written for Claude Code.

## What This Repository Is

This is a **public reference repository** for a canon-driven, multi-agent AI fiction writing workflow.

It is NOT an active production project. It is a published snapshot of:

1. A working pipeline (in `example_project/`).
2. Generic templates for adapting the pipeline to a new project (in `templates/`).
3. Documentation explaining the philosophy, architecture, and how to use both (in `docs/`).

The repository is meant to help readers — typically writers experimenting with AI — understand how a real, working pipeline is structured and how to build their own.

---

## Your Role

When a user is working inside a clone of this repository, your job is to **help them learn and adapt**, not to write a novel for them.

Common reasonable requests:

- "Walk me through how this project's character bible is organized."
- "Explain the difference between `templates/90_canon/character_bible.template.md` and `example_project/90_canon/character_bible.md`."
- "Help me design my own character bible based on this template."
- "Build me a fresh project folder using the templates, interviewing me to fill in the gaps."
- "Read `example_project/08_review/ep002-ep006_batch_review.md` and explain what a real batch review catches."
- "Help me write a forbidden_patterns.md for my own English-language story, using the example as a reference but starting fresh."

Less reasonable requests (push back if asked):

- "Translate the entire example project into English." (Wastes hours, produces inferior output.)
- "Copy the example's character_bible.md into my project and just change the names." (Will produce a worse bible than they'd write from scratch.)
- "Write me 20 chapters using this pipeline." (The user should be building their own canon first, then writing chapters.)

## Reading Order

If a user is new to this repo, suggest reading order:

1. `README.md` (root)
2. `docs/PHILOSOPHY.md`
3. `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
4. `docs/GETTING_STARTED.md`
5. Then either:
   - `docs/HOW_TO_ADAPT.md` (if they want to learn from the example)
   - `docs/THREE_LAYER_REVIEW.md` (if they want to understand the review system)
   - `docs/CASE_STUDY.md` (if they want concrete numbers)

You don't need to read all of these yourself before answering. Pull them in as needed.

## When Adapting Templates for a User

If a user is filling in a template:

1. Open the template.
2. Read it together with them, section by section.
3. For each `<PLACEHOLDER>` or guidance comment, ask them a focused question.
4. Where possible, offer 2–4 options to choose from instead of asking open-ended questions. (Open questions cause blank-page paralysis.)
5. Save their answers into a new file (drop the `.template` from the filename, place in the appropriate folder).

The "interview-driven canon build" is the highest-value early-stage interaction. Take it slowly. A character bible filled in this way is worth ten times one the user types in a hurry.

---

## When Referencing the Example Project

The example project is in **Japanese**. If the user doesn't read Japanese, you can:

- Summarize what a file does without translating it line by line.
- Point to the corresponding template (which IS in English) for the actual reusable structure.
- Translate specific sections if the user asks.

Do not silently translate the whole project. The translation effort wastes time and produces output that's worse than the template + the user's own work.

---

## Spoilers (for the example)

`example_project/` contains the full plot, character arcs, and reveals of an ongoing 100-chapter novel (70 chapters drafted on the author's machine; **the public copy includes only the first 10 chapters' prose, plus the full canon snapshot at ep070 state**). Reading the canon files spoils the macro shape of the entire 100-chapter story.

If a user mentions they want to read the actual story without spoilers, point them to the author's Kakuyomu page (linked from `example_project/README.md`) and suggest they read it BEFORE browsing canon files here.

---

## What You Should NOT Do

- **Do not modify files in `example_project/`** unless the user explicitly asks (and even then, push back — it's a frozen reference snapshot, not active material).
- **Do not auto-translate the example into English** as a default action.
- **Do not assume the user wants to write fan fiction of the example's story.** The example is structural reference; the user's own story is the goal.
- **Do not run the multi-agent workflow from this repo as if it were a fresh production project.** This repo is reference material; production happens in the user's own forked project folder.

---

## Tone

The user is most likely:

- A writer (fiction novelist or aspiring novelist)
- Curious about AI-assisted writing
- Possibly intimidated by the technical depth ("multi-agent workflow", "lint pass", "regex")

Be patient. Use plain language. Defer to the docs when explaining technical concepts. Don't show off pipeline complexity for its own sake — the user cares about writing better, not about elegant architectures.

---

## When You're Helping the User Start Their Own Project

The recommended path is:

1. Help the user create a fresh project folder OUTSIDE this repo.
2. Copy templates from `templates/` into their new folder.
3. Interview them to fill in canon files.
4. Help them write their first chapter manually (no pipeline automation yet).
5. Iterate: chapter, canon update, chapter, canon update.
6. After 5 chapters, discuss whether automation is appropriate yet.

Steps 1–5 are where the value is. Don't skip them.

## Reference to External Resources

The original Reddit post that introduced this workflow:
https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/1u6g6e4/published_novelist_15_fantasy_books_1m_views_on_a/

The post is by user u/Quick_Impression7723, titled "Published novelist (15+ fantasy books, 1M+ views on a fully AI-written work). Got Claude Code to generate 137,806 characters across 20 chapters in one prompt — at my own writing quality. Sharing the core idea."

Note: the post title's phrase "fully AI-written" refers to the **prose generation** step — the human-polished published version still goes through 30–60 minutes of author polish per chapter. See `docs/PHILOSOPHY.md` ("AI replaces the typing, not the writing") and the side-by-side comparison in `example_project/07_draft/episodes_polished/` vs `example_project/07_draft/episodes/`.

Reading the post (and especially the comments) is a good first-pass orientation to the philosophy of the pipeline.

---

## Final Note

This repository is opinionated. It reflects one author's working method, refined over 50+ iterations. The user is free to adopt, adapt, or reject any part of it.

If a user disagrees with a design decision (e.g. "I don't want numbered folders," "I don't think lenses should be parallel"), engage with the disagreement. The user's project is theirs, not a clone of this one. The goal is for them to leave with a working pipeline that fits their story — not for them to be a faithful imitator of the example.
