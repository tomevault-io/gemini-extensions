# Harness Engineering: AI Agent Knowledge Map

This is the single source of truth for AI agents working on the Harness Engineering project. It provides essential context about our repository structure, architecture, conventions, and where to find information.

## Project Overview

**Harness Engineering** is a comprehensive toolkit for transitioning from manual coding to **agent-first development**. We help teams architect software in ways that enable AI agents to execute, maintain, and improve code reliably and autonomously.

### Purpose and Goals

- Create a reusable library and toolkit for agent-first development
- Establish patterns that make AI-driven development predictable and scalable
- Document architectural decisions as the single source of truth
- Enforce constraints mechanically rather than through code review
- Measure and improve agent autonomy over time

### Current Phase

**Complete** — All core packages (types, core, cli, eslint-plugin, linter-gen, graph, orchestrator), 737 skills (claude-code and gemini-cli), 12 personas, 19 templates, and 3 progressive examples are implemented. The project is in adoption and refinement mode. See `examples/` for progressive tutorials.

## Repository Structure

This is a **monorepo** using pnpm workspaces and Turborepo for orchestration.

### Package Relationships

- **types** → Shared type definitions (no dependencies)
- **core** → Runtime library (depends on types)
- **graph** → Knowledge graph for codebase relationships and entropy detection (depends on types)
- **orchestrator** → Agent orchestration and multi-agent coordination (depends on core)
- All packages follow strict dependency rules: no circular dependencies, no upward dependencies

## Architecture

### Layered Architecture

We follow a strict, one-way dependency model:

```
Types (bottom layer - no dependencies)
  ↓
Configuration & Constants
  ↓
Repository & Data Access
  ↓
Services & Business Logic
  ↓
Agents & External Interfaces (top layer)
```

**Key Rule**: Layers can only depend on lower layers, never upward.

### Design Decisions

1. **TypeScript Strict Mode** - All code runs with strict type checking enabled
2. **Project References** - We use tsconfig project references for proper compilation order and dependency validation
3. **Monorepo Structure** - Enables shared code and consistent tooling across packages
4. **Documentation-First** - All architectural decisions live in git as version-controlled markdown
5. **Result<T, E> Pattern** - Explicit error handling using Result types (similar to Rust's Result)

### Module Boundaries

Each package has a clear responsibility:

- **types**: Type definitions, interfaces, and constants used across packages
- **graph**: Knowledge graph store, ContextQL queries, code/git/knowledge ingestion, FusionLayer search
- **core**: Runtime library with validation, constraints, entropy detection, architecture checks, and pricing/cost calculation (depends on types, graph)
- **eslint-plugin**: ESLint rules for architectural constraint enforcement (depends on types, core)
- **linter-gen**: YAML-to-ESLint rule generator (depends on types, core)
- **orchestrator**: Agent orchestration daemon for dispatching coding agents to issues (depends on types, core)
- **dashboard**: Web dashboard — React + Hono full-stack app with 10 pages (Overview, Roadmap, Health, Graph, Impact, Adoption, Analyze, Attention, Chat, Orchestrator), SSE-based live updates, and server-side data gathering (depends on types, core, graph)
- **cli**: CLI tool and MCP server — top-level integration layer (depends on all packages)

### Notable Core Modules

- **pricing** (`packages/core/src/pricing/`): LiteLLM-based model pricing lookup. Fetches pricing data from LiteLLM's GitHub JSON with a 24h disk cache at `.harness/cache/pricing.json`, falling back to a bundled `fallback.json` for offline/CI use. Public API: `getModelPrice(model)` returns per-1M-token rates, `calculateCost(record)` returns integer microdollars (USD \* 1,000,000) to avoid floating-point drift. Supports Claude, GPT-4, and Gemini model families.
  - `pricing.ts` — Parses LiteLLM's raw pricing JSON into a PricingDataset map, filtering to chat models with valid costs

### Git Workflow and Commit Conventions

We use **Conventional Commits** for clear, machine-readable commit messages:

```
type(scope): brief description

Optional longer explanation of the change and why it was made.
```

**Commit Types:**

- `feat:` - New feature or functionality
- `fix:` - Bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation changes (no code changes)
- `style:` - Code style changes (formatting, semicolons, etc.)
- `refactor:` - Code changes without new features or fixes
- `test:` - Test additions or modifications
- `chore:` - Dependency updates, tooling, etc.

**Example Commits:**

```
feat(core): add Result type for error handling
fix(types): correct generic constraints on Handler interface
docs: update AGENTS.md with architecture overview
refactor(core): simplify validation logic
test(core): add tests for Result type
```

## Key Concepts

### Result<T, E> Pattern

We use a Result type (similar to Rust) for explicit error handling:

```typescript
type Result<T, E> = { ok: true; value: T } | { ok: false; error: E };
```

This provides:

- **Explicit error handling** - No surprise errors
- **Type-safe operations** - Compiler enforces error handling
- **Clear intent** - Functions signal they may fail
- **Composability** - Easy to chain operations

### TypeScript Project References

We use `tsconfig.json` project references for:

- **Proper compilation order** - Dependencies compile first
- **Incremental builds** - Only rebuild what changed
- **Dependency validation** - Prevent circular dependencies
- **Clear boundaries** - Explicit package dependencies

Configuration example:

```json
{
  "references": [{ "path": "./packages/types" }, { "path": "./packages/core" }]
}
```

### CLI Subsystems

### Telemetry Subsystem

Anonymous product analytics collection implemented across `packages/types`, `packages/core`, and `packages/cli`. Zero vendor SDK dependencies -- uses Node's built-in `fetch()` to POST events to PostHog's HTTP batch API.

**Architecture:**

- **Types** (`packages/types/src/telemetry.ts`): `TelemetryConfig`, `TelemetryIdentity`, `ConsentState`, `TelemetryEvent`
- **Core** (`packages/core/src/telemetry/`):
  - `consent.ts` -- Merges env vars (`DO_NOT_TRACK`, `HARNESS_TELEMETRY_OPTOUT`), config (`telemetry.enabled`), and `.harness/telemetry.json` identity into a `ConsentState`
  - `install-id.ts` -- Creates/reads a persistent anonymous UUIDv4 at `.harness/.install-id`
  - `collector.ts` -- Reads `adoption.jsonl` and formats `TelemetryEvent` payloads
  - `transport.ts` -- HTTP POST to PostHog `/batch` with 3 retries, 5s timeout, silent failure
- **CLI** (`packages/cli/src/commands/telemetry/`): `identify` (set/clear `.harness/telemetry.json`), `status` (display consent state, install ID, identity, env overrides)
- **Hook** (`packages/cli/src/hooks/telemetry-reporter.js`): Stop hook that runs the full pipeline (consent check, collect, send, first-run notice)

**Consent priority:** `DO_NOT_TRACK=1` > `HARNESS_TELEMETRY_OPTOUT=1` > `harness.config.json telemetry.enabled` > default (enabled)

**Data sent (when enabled):** install ID, OS, Node version, harness version, skill name, duration, outcome. Identity fields (project, team, alias) only when explicitly set in `.harness/telemetry.json`.

**Data NOT sent:** file paths, file contents, code, prompts, or any PII unless user opts in via identity fields.

### Dashboard Package

`packages/dashboard/` is a React + Hono full-stack app providing a web-based project health dashboard.

**Client** (`src/client/`): React SPA with 10 pages (Overview, Roadmap, Health, Graph, Impact, Adoption, Analyze, Attention, Chat, Orchestrator), reusable components (KpiCard, GanttChart, DependencyGraph, BlastRadiusGraph, ProgressChart, ActionButton, StaleIndicator, Layout), and SSE-based live data hooks (`useSSE`, `useApi`).

**Server** (`src/server/`): Hono HTTP server with SSE connection manager running a shared polling loop. Routes: overview, health, impact, ci, actions, sse, health-check. Data gatherers: health, ci, blast-radius, arch, anomalies.

### Graph Subsystems

In addition to the core graph store and ContextQL engine:

- `query/Traceability.ts` — Traces requirement-to-code/test coverage with confidence levels and EARS pattern detection
- `ingest/RequirementIngestor.ts` — Ingests requirements from spec markdown sections (Observable Truths, Success Criteria, Acceptance Criteria)
- `blast-radius/CascadeSimulator.ts` — Probability-weighted BFS simulating cascading failure propagation from a source node
- `blast-radius/CompositeProbabilityStrategy.ts` — Blends edge type weight (50%), change frequency (30%), and coupling strength (20%) for failure propagation probability
- `benchmarks/queries.bench.ts` — Vitest benchmarks for graph queries with medium (100-node) synthetic fixtures

### Types Package Detail

Beyond the core Result, Config, and ValidationError types:

- `workflow.ts` — Types for multi-skill workflows with step dependencies, gates, and outcomes
- `usage.ts` — UsageRecord composition of TokenUsage with cache tokens, model, and cost tracking
- `tracker-sync.ts` — ExternalTicket/ExternalTicketState types for bidirectional tracker integration
- `session-state.ts` — SessionSectionName union type and session entry lifecycle
- `ci.ts` — CICheckName, CICheckStatus, and CICheckIssue types for CI check reporting

### Unified Knowledge Graph

The `packages/graph` package provides a graph-based context system that unifies code structure, organizational knowledge, and external data into a single queryable model. It powers context assembly, entropy detection, constraint enforcement, and skill execution across the entire toolkit. Key components: LokiJS graph store, ContextQL query engine, FusionLayer (keyword + semantic search), code/git/knowledge ingestion pipelines, CascadeSimulator (probabilistic failure propagation via `compute_blast_radius` MCP tool), and 4 external connectors (Jira, Slack, Confluence, CI).

### Skill Tier System

Skills are classified into three tiers to preserve context. Only Tier 1 and Tier 2 skills are registered as slash commands; Tier 3 skills are discoverable via the `search_skills` MCP tool.

- **Tier 1 (Workflow, 11 skills):** Always-loaded slash commands for core workflow — brainstorming, planning, execution, autopilot, tdd, debugging, refactoring, skill-authoring, onboarding, initialize-project, add-component.
- **Tier 2 (Maintenance, 21 skills):** Always-loaded slash commands for project health — integrity, verify, code-review, release-readiness, docs-pipeline, codebase-cleanup, enforce-architecture, detect-doc-drift, cleanup-dead-code, dependency-health, hotspot-detector, security-scan, perf, impact-analysis, test-advisor, soundness-review, architecture-advisor, roadmap, verification, supply-chain-audit, roadmap-pilot.
- **Tier 3 (Catalog, 43 skills):** Discoverable on demand via `search_skills`. Includes domain skills (API design, database, deployment, containerization, etc.), design skills, i18n, and specialized testing.
- **Internal (6 skills):** Dependency-only, never surfaced. Invoked by other skills as part of pipelines.

The `search_skills` MCP tool (`packages/cli/src/mcp/tools/search-skills.ts`) queries a merged index of bundled + community skills. The index uses hash-based staleness detection. An intelligent dispatcher (`packages/cli/src/skill/dispatcher.ts`) suggests relevant Tier 3 skills when Tier 1 workflow skills start. Stack profile detection (`packages/cli/src/skill/stack-profile.ts`) identifies project technologies to bias suggestions. Configuration overrides in `harness.config.json` support `skills.alwaysSuggest`, `skills.neverSuggest`, and `skills.tierOverrides`.

### Community Skill Registry

The `@harness-skills/*` npm namespace enables publishing, discovering, and installing community skills. Key commands: `harness install`, `harness uninstall`, `harness skill search`, `harness skill create`, `harness skill publish`. Supports local installs (`--from ./path`), private registries (`--registry <url>`), and `.npmrc` auth tokens. Skills are pure content packages (no runtime code). Discovery priority: project-local > community > bundled.

Implementation in `packages/cli/src/registry/` and `packages/cli/src/commands/skill/`. See the [Skill Marketplace Guide](./docs/guides/skill-marketplace.md) for full usage, architecture, and examples.

### Project Roadmap

The project roadmap lives at `docs/roadmap.md` and tracks features across milestones with statuses (`backlog`, `planned`, `in-progress`, `done`, `blocked`). Core implementation in `packages/core/src/roadmap/` provides `parseRoadmap`, `serializeRoadmap`, and `syncRoadmap`. The `manage_roadmap` MCP tool (`packages/cli/src/mcp/tools/roadmap.ts`) exposes CRUD operations: `show`, `add`, `update`, `remove`, `query`, `sync`. The `harness-roadmap` skill provides interactive workflows: `--create`, `--add`, `--sync`, `--edit`, `--query`. Roadmap sync respects a "human-always-wins" rule — manually edited statuses are preserved unless `force_sync` is set. The orchestrator adapter (`packages/orchestrator/src/tracker/adapters/roadmap.ts`) maps roadmap features to the internal Issue model for agent orchestration.

**External tracker sync** — Bidirectional sync between `roadmap.md` and GitHub Issues via `TrackerSyncAdapter` (`packages/core/src/roadmap/tracker-sync.ts`). The `GitHubIssuesSyncAdapter` (`packages/core/src/roadmap/adapters/github-issues.ts`) uses label-based status disambiguation for the open/closed limitation. The sync engine (`packages/core/src/roadmap/sync-engine.ts`) provides `syncToExternal` (push planning fields), `syncFromExternal` (pull execution fields with directional guard via `status-rank.ts`), and `fullSync` (mutex-serialized read-push-pull-write cycle). Configuration via `roadmap.tracker` in `harness.config.json` (validated by `TrackerConfigSchema` in `packages/cli/src/config/schema.ts`). Auto-sync fires on 6 state transitions via `triggerExternalSync` in `packages/cli/src/mcp/tools/roadmap-auto-sync.ts`.

**Auto-pick pilot** — The `harness-roadmap-pilot` skill (`agents/skills/claude-code/harness-roadmap-pilot/`) selects the next highest-impact unblocked item using a two-tier sort: explicit priority first (P0–P3), then weighted score (position 0.5, dependents 0.3, affinity 0.2). Scoring algorithm and `assignFeature` function in `packages/core/src/roadmap/pilot-scoring.ts`. Routes to `harness:brainstorming` (no spec) or `harness:autopilot` (spec exists). Assignment updates the feature's `Assignee` field, appends to the `## Assignment History` section, and syncs to the external tracker.

### Monorepo Structure Benefits

- **Shared Dependencies** - One pnpm-lock.yaml ensures consistency
- **Unified Tooling** - Same linting, formatting, and test configuration
- **Coordinated Changes** - Easy to update multiple packages together
- **Turborepo Caching** - Faster builds with smart caching

### Documentation-First Approach

All architectural decisions must be documented:

1. **Design Documents** - Explain the "why" before implementing
2. **Architecture Decisions** - Record key choices in `/docs/standard/`
3. **Implementation Plans** - Track execution in `/docs/plans/`
4. **Specifications** - Detailed technical specs in `/docs/changes/`
5. **Guides** - How-to documentation for common tasks

This creates a permanent record that AI agents can access and understand.

### Key Documentation

When working on this project, agents should prioritize reading:

1. **First**: [Harness Engineering Standard](./docs/standard/index.md) - Understanding the vision
2. **Second**: [Seven Core Principles](./docs/standard/principles.md) - Understanding how it works
3. **Third**: [Getting Started Guide](./docs/guides/getting-started.md) - Practical setup
4. **Reference**: [Implementation Guide](./docs/standard/implementation.md) - Detailed guidance
5. **Context**: This file (AGENTS.md) - Navigation and quick reference

## Conventions

### Code Style

- **TypeScript Strict Mode** - All code compiles with `strict: true`
- **ESLint** - Configured in `eslint.config.js` for code quality rules
- **Prettier** - Auto-formatting with rules in `.prettierrc.json`
  - 2-space indentation
  - Single quotes for strings
  - Trailing commas where valid
  - Line length: 100 characters (practical limit)

### Code Organization

- **Barrel Exports** - Each package has `src/index.ts` that re-exports public API
- **Type-Safe Code** - No `any` types unless absolutely necessary with `// @ts-ignore` comments
- **Clear Imports** - Explicit imports from package exports, not internal paths

### Commit Message Format

Follow **Conventional Commits** (see Git Workflow section above):

```
type(scope): brief description under 50 chars

Optional longer body explaining the "why" and "what" of the change.
Keep lines under 72 characters for readability.

Closes #123  # Optional reference to related issues
```

### Documentation Standards

When writing documentation:

1. **Be Specific** - Explain decisions, not just facts
2. **Include Examples** - Code examples for technical decisions
3. **Link References** - Link to related docs
4. **Update AGENTS.md** - Add new docs to the navigation
5. **Explain the Why** - Focus on reasoning, not just implementation

Example documentation template:

```markdown
# Feature Name

## Overview

One-sentence description of what this is and why it exists.

## Design

Detailed explanation of the design and key decisions.

## Implementation

How it works technically with code examples.

## Examples

Real-world usage examples.

## Related

Links to related documentation.
```

### Testing Approach

- **Unit Tests** - Test individual functions and classes
- **Integration Tests** - Test package interactions
- **Test Coverage** - Aim for high coverage of critical paths
- **Descriptive Names** - Test names explain what is being tested

Test file locations:

- Core code: `src/module.ts`
- Tests: `tests/module.test.ts`

## Common Tasks for Agents

### Adding a New Package

1. **Create directory structure**:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p packages/my-package/src
   ```

2. **Create package.json** with name `@harness-engineering/my-package`

3. **Add TypeScript configuration** (`tsconfig.json`)

4. **Export from src/index.ts** (barrel export)

5. **Add to root tsconfig.json** references

6. **Add to pnpm-workspace.yaml** if not auto-detected

### Updating Documentation

1. **Create or edit markdown file** in appropriate `/docs/` subdirectory

2. **Follow documentation standards** (see Conventions section)

3. **Update navigation** - Add links to AGENTS.md or VitePress config if needed

4. **Link to related docs** - Help agents navigate to context

5. **Update AGENTS.md** if creating new major sections

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm test

# Watch mode for development
pnpm test:watch

# Test specific package
pnpm test --filter=@harness-engineering/core

# Run with coverage
pnpm test -- --coverage
```

### Building the Project

```bash
# Build all packages
pnpm build

# Build specific package
pnpm build --filter=@harness-engineering/core

# Development mode (watch)
pnpm dev

# Clean build (remove artifacts)
pnpm clean && pnpm build
```

## Context for AI Agents

### Our Approach to AI Development

This project is **specifically designed** for AI agents to work on it effectively:

1. **Documentation is Law** - Decisions are recorded, not assumed
2. **Explicit Over Implicit** - Clear patterns and constraints guide work
3. **Mechanical Validation** - Rules are enforced by code, not hope
4. **Self-Verification** - Agents can run tests and validate their work
5. **Context-Dense** - All information needed is in the repository

### Principles to Follow

When working on this project, AI agents should:

1. **Read AGENTS.md First** - Understand the project context
2. **Check Related Documentation** - Follow links to understand decisions
3. **Follow Conventions Strictly** - Code style, commit messages, structure
4. **Write Tests** - Verify new code before committing
5. **Update Documentation** - Keep docs in sync with code changes
6. **Self-Review** - Run tests, check formatting, verify types before submitting
7. **Be Specific in PRs** - Explain the why, not just the what
8. **Respect Boundaries** - Stay within architectural constraints

### Harness Engineering Principles

The project embodies these core principles:

1. **Context Engineering** - All knowledge lives in git (this AGENTS.md, architectural docs, specs)
2. **Architectural Rigidity** - Layered architecture with mechanical constraints prevents bad patterns
3. **Agent Feedback Loop** - Self-review, peer review, testing all happen before human review
4. **Entropy Management** - Documentation must stay in sync with code
5. **Depth-First Implementation** - Complete features fully before starting new ones
6. **Measurable Success** - Track metrics: agent autonomy, harness coverage, context density

### Error Handling Pattern

Always use Result types for operations that may fail:

```typescript
import type { Result, ValidationError } from '@harness-engineering/core';
import { createError } from '@harness-engineering/core';

export function validateConfig(data: unknown): Result<Config, ValidationError> {
  if (!isValidConfig(data)) {
    return {
      ok: false,
      error: createError<ValidationError>('VALIDATION_FAILED', 'Invalid config'),
    };
  }
  return { ok: true, value: data as Config };
}
```

This makes error handling explicit and type-safe.
