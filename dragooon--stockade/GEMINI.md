# Stockade — Agent Platform

Multi-agent orchestrator for Claude with layered security. Agents run in containers with no secrets, per-tool permissions, and a credential-injecting MITM proxy.

## Architecture

```
User (Terminal / Discord)
  ↓
Orchestrator  →  Router (scope → agent)  →  Dispatcher (query / HTTP)
  ↓                                            ↓
RBAC (user identity flows through chain)   Agent (Claude Code SDK session)
  ↓                                            ↓
Permissions (first-match-wins rules)       Credential Proxy (MITM, inject per-route)
  ↓                                            ↓
Gatekeeper (AI risk review for ask rules)  Network Policy (deny-by-default allowlist)
```

Key flow: message arrives on a channel → router resolves scope to agent ID → RBAC checks user access → dispatcher launches agent (in-process or container) → agent runs tools with permission checks → gatekeeper reviews `ask` rules → credential proxy injects secrets on the wire.

## Config Location

Live config lives in `~/.stockade/` (decoupled from the source repo):
- `~/.stockade/config.yaml` — agents, channels, RBAC, containers, gatekeeper
- `~/.stockade/proxy.yaml` — credential provider, network policy, HTTP/SSH routes
- `~/.stockade/secrets/` — file-based credential store
- `~/.stockade/proxy/` — TLS certs (ca.crt, ca.key, ssh-ca)

Example configs in `config/` are templates for new users. Never commit real config or secrets.

## Permission System

First-match-wins rules per agent. Default when no rule matches: `ask` (HITL approval).

```yaml
permissions:
  - "deny:Write(/config/**)"    # /prefix = platform root (~/.stockade)
  - "ask:Bash(rm *)"            # Glob match on command
  - "allow:*"                   # Catchall — allow everything else
```

Path prefixes: `/` = platform root, `~/` = home, `./` = agent cwd, `//` = absolute POSIX.

## Skills

All skills live in one shared directory: `~/.stockade/.claude/skills/`. Changes are immediately visible to all agents — no restart or copy step needed.

- **Host agents** (`sandboxed: false`): pick up skills automatically because `sdkCwd = platformRoot` (`~/.stockade`), so the SDK loads `~/.stockade/.claude/skills/` natively.
- **Sandboxed agents** (Docker): the skills directory is volume-mounted read-write into the container at `/workspace/.claude/skills`.

**Skill visibility is controlled by permission rules**, not by which skills exist on disk. Use `allow:Skill(name)` / `deny:Skill(*)` in an agent's `permissions:` list:

```yaml
permissions:
  - "allow:Skill(tavily-search)"
  - "allow:Skill(goplaces)"
  - "deny:Skill(*)"       # hide everything else
  - "allow:*"
```

This maps to two enforcement layers:
1. **SDK-native** (`sdkSettings.permissions.allow/deny`) — denied skills are stripped from the agent's context entirely (0 tokens consumed).
2. **PreToolUse hook** — blocks invocation at runtime for any skill not explicitly allowed.

Both layers are derived from the same `allow:Skill(name)` rules via `extractSkillPermissions()` in `dispatcher.ts`.

The `skills?: string[]` field on AgentConfig is deprecated — use permission rules instead.

## Gatekeeper

AI-powered risk classification for tool invocations that hit `ask` rules. Configured in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
gatekeeper:
  enabled: true
  agent: gatekeeper        # References an agent defined in the agents section
  auto_approve_risk: low   # Auto-approve low risk; medium+ prompts user
```

Risk levels: `low`, `medium`, `high`, `critical`. The gatekeeper agent's system prompt controls classification logic. When the gatekeeper can't run (no API key, errors), defaults to `medium`.

## Credential Proxy

MITM proxy that intercepts agent HTTPS traffic for two purposes:

**1. Third-party credential injection** (route-based):
- Strips auth headers from agent requests matching a configured route
- Resolves credential via provider (file, 1Password, etc.)
- Injects credential into the correct header
- Applies to 3rd-party APIs only (GitHub, Tavily, etc.) — NOT Anthropic API

**2. Anthropic API passthrough** (no route needed):
- Injects prompt cache markers (system + conversation history)
- Strips Stockade context headers (X-Stockade-Session/Agent/Scope)
- Writes audit logs if `STOCKADE_AUDIT_LOG=1`
- Auth headers pass through untouched — the SDK handles its own OAuth

**Anthropic API auth** is handled entirely by the SDK. The SDK reads `~/.claude/.credentials.json`, refreshes tokens via `platform.claude.com` (in `NO_PROXY`, bypasses MITM), and sends `Authorization: Bearer <token>` which the proxy passes through. Containers mount the host's real credentials file read-only.

Provider overrides route specific keys to different backends (first glob match wins). Providers can optionally define `signin` + `session_env` — the signin command runs once, its stdout is cached, and injected as the named env var into every subsequent command. On auth errors, the session is refreshed automatically.

Ref tokens (`apw-ref:<key>:<nonce>`) let agents pass credentials in request bodies without seeing the real value — the proxy does literal string substitution before forwarding.

**Prompt cache injection** — automatic, no config needed. Last system block gets a 1-hour TTL; second-to-last user message gets 1-hour TTL (SDK bug workaround); last user message gets 5-minute ephemeral. Haiku uses standard ephemeral throughout (no extended TTL support).

**Audit logging** — set `STOCKADE_AUDIT_LOG=1` to write NDJSON to `~/.stockade/logs/`:
- `cache-meta.ndjson` — per-call token stats (input, cache_read, cache_create, latency, session/agent/scope)
- `requests.ndjson` — per-session system prompt snapshot (logged once per session ID)

## Development

```bash
pnpm install                 # Install deps
pnpm build                   # Build all packages
pnpm test                    # Run all tests (~724 passing)
pnpm start:orchestrator      # Start orchestrator (terminal channel)
pnpm start:proxy             # Start credential proxy
pnpm start:validate          # Validate config without starting
```

Dev mode: `pnpm start:orchestrator` uses tsx for direct TypeScript execution.

### Worker changes require a full rebuild

There are two worker execution modes with different rebuild requirements:

- **Docker/sandboxed container workers** (e.g. `main`): run the **compiled dist** inside the Docker image. Changes to `packages/worker/src/` require a `pnpm build` + `docker build` + restart.
- **Host process workers** (e.g. `kleya`, `browse`): spawn via `node --import tsx packages/worker/src/index.ts` directly. They pick up source changes on the next restart — no dist rebuild needed, but a `docker build` is still needed if the Docker image is used by any sandboxed agent.

Full deploy sequence when worker source changes:

```bash
cd ~/.stockade/repo
pnpm --filter @stockade/worker build                              # Recompile dist/ (for Docker image)
pnpm test                                                         # Full suite — abort if any fail
git add -A && git commit -m "Deploy: <summary>"                   # Commit exactly what was tested
docker build -f packages/worker/Dockerfile -t stockade/worker .  # Rebuild image (sandboxed agents)
echo "restart" > ~/.stockade/restart.signal                       # Signal restart
```

Ordering matters: dist rebuild → **tests must pass** → **commit** → Docker image → restart.

**Never write the restart signal if `pnpm test` fails.** A broken restart causes a permanent outage — the orchestrator cannot recover on its own. Kleya runs the full test suite (including Docker e2e tests that sandboxed agents cannot access) before committing or restarting.

### E2E test isolation

The e2e tests are fully isolated from the running platform:
- `docker-real.test.ts` — creates its own network (`stockade-test-net`), containers (labeled `stockade-test`), and image (`stockade-e2e-test:latest`); cleans up in `afterAll`. Never touches production containers.
- `host-worker.test.ts` — spawns worker processes on random free ports; never connects to the running orchestrator.
- Unit tests — fully mocked.

Running `pnpm test` on the host is safe at any time and does not affect the live platform.

The orchestrator polls `~/.stockade/restart.signal` every 2s. When detected, it tears down all running containers and exits with code 75. The launcher loop (`bin/start-orchestrator` or the nohup wrapper) relaunches automatically. Containers reprovision on first dispatch after restart.

## SDK Permission Interaction

The Claude Code SDK has a hardcoded safety check (`Mjz`) that blocks writes to `{cwd}/.claude/skills/`, `{cwd}/.claude/agents/`, and `{cwd}/.claude/commands/` regardless of `permissionMode` or the `PreToolUse` hook result. This check is in the SDK's `zy1()` function and runs unconditionally during Edit/Write tool execution — it cannot be bypassed via `allowDangerouslySkipPermissions` or allow rules.

**Fix (implemented 2026-04-06):** The dispatcher passes `sdkCwd = platformRoot` (not the agent workspace) as the `cwd` option to the worker's `query()` call. The SDK's `o1()` function returns this cwd as the project root used by `Mjz()`, so it checks `{platformRoot}/.claude/skills/` (which doesn't exist) instead of the actual agent workspace skills path. The agent workspace is passed as `addDir` so CLAUDE.md and skills still load correctly.

Relevant files:
- `packages/orchestrator/src/dispatcher.ts` — `sdkCwd`/`sdkAddDirs` logic
- `packages/worker/src/agent.ts` — passes `addDir` to `query()` options
- `packages/worker/src/types.ts` — `WorkerSessionRequest.addDir` field

The permission context (`agentCwd`) still uses the real agent workspace path for permission rule evaluation — only the SDK's internal cwd changes.

## Key Conventions

- TypeScript throughout, Zod for config validation
- Vitest for testing; unit tests mock, e2e tests use real infra (no mocks in e2e)
- Claude Code Agent SDK (`@anthropic-ai/claude-code-sdk`) for agent sessions
- `system_mode: append` uses SDK's Claude Code preset + appends custom system prompt
- Agent workspaces: `~/.stockade/agents/<agent-id>/`
- Sessions persisted in SQLite: `~/.stockade/sessions.db`
- Sub-agent sessions use in-memory map (not SQLite); do not persist across restarts
- Skills live at `~/.stockade/.claude/skills/` — one shared directory, no per-agent copying or restart needed to pick up changes. Sandboxed agents get it volume-mounted at `/workspace/.claude/skills`; host agents inherit it via `sdkCwd = platformRoot`
- Env vars in config via `${VAR_NAME}` syntax, `~/` expansion in string values
- Logs: `~/.stockade/logs/` (cache-meta.ndjson, requests.ndjson when audit logging enabled)

## RBAC

User identity flows through the entire sub-agent delegation chain. Roles define tool permissions that apply at every level:

```yaml
rbac:
  roles:
    owner:
      permissions: ["agent:*", "tool:*"]
    user:
      permissions: ["agent:main"]
      deny: ["tool:Bash", "tool:Write"]
  users:
    username:
      roles: [owner]
      identities:
        discord: "discord-user-id"
        terminal: "os-username"
```

## Channels

- **Terminal**: stdin/stdout, scope format `terminal:<username>`
- **Discord**: Bot integration, scope format `discord:<server>:<channel>:<user>`
  - Shared channel awareness: agents receive ALL messages, must use judgment on when to respond
  - Bindings map servers/channels to agents

## Shared Directory

All agents — sandboxed and host — share a common read-write directory at `~/.stockade/shared/` on the host.

| Context | Path |
|---|---|
| Sandboxed (Docker) | `/shared` (volume-mounted automatically) |
| Host agent | `$SHARED_DIR` env var (`~/.stockade/shared/`) |

Use it for file exchange between agents, cross-session artifact persistence, and staging outputs. The directory is created on orchestrator startup. Instructions are injected into all agents via `~/.stockade/CLAUDE.md` (the platform-level CLAUDE.md loaded by the SDK for all agents since `sdkCwd = platformRoot`).

## Container Isolation

Sandboxed agents run in Docker on an internal network (`stockade-net`). The credential proxy is their only route out. Container lifecycle managed by `ContainerManager` — auto-provisioning, health checks, and cleanup.

**Standard volume mounts (automatic):**
- Agent workspace → `/workspace` (CLAUDE.md, memory, agent-local files)
- `~/.stockade/.claude/skills/` → `/workspace/.claude/skills` (shared platform skills, read-write)
- `~/.claude/.credentials.json` → `/home/node/.claude/.credentials.json` (OAuth, read-only; path adjusts to `/root/.claude/.credentials.json` when `user: root`)
- Proxy CA cert → `/certs/proxy-ca.crt` (when proxy is available)

**Extra volumes** — arbitrary additional mounts via the agent's `container.volumes` list. `~/` and `${VAR}` are expanded:
```yaml
container:
  volumes:
    - "~/.stockade/repo:/repo"
```

**Container user override** — set `container.user` to run as a specific user (e.g. `root` for Docker socket access). The credentials mount path adjusts automatically:
```yaml
container:
  user: root
```

**Workspace path overrides** — when the Docker host filesystem differs from the orchestrator's (e.g. WSL2), set on the agent's `container:` block:
- `workspace_path` — path relative to `agents_dir` (resolved on the host before passing to Docker)
- `workspace_host_path` — explicit host-side absolute path passed directly to Docker `-v`

Priority: `workspace_host_path` > `workspace_path` > `{agents_dir}/{agent_id}` (default).
