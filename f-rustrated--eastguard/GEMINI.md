EastGuard = zero-controller messaging system for flexible scalability + high operability. Inspired by LinkedIn's Northguard architecture.

# 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

# 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

# 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

# 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:
```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

# Two replica sets (don't conflate)

EastGuard has two distinct "replica sets", chosen by different mechanisms and **decoupled** — they drift apart and must not be confused:

- **Raft replica set** — a shard group's *consensus peers* (`Raft::peers`: voters + learners). Who replicates the group's *metadata log*. Changes via committed `AddPeer`/`RemovePeer` (see `raft.md`).
- **Data replica set** — a *segment's* `replica_set` (`SegmentMeta.replica_set`). Where the segment *bytes* live. Changes via committed `RollSegment`/`ReassignSegment`, decided by the owning Raft group's leader (see `metadata-state-machine.md`, `raft-actor.md`).

A node can be in one without the other. "Is node N a data replica of segment S?" is answered only by S's owning Raft group's committed `replica_set` — **never** by whether N hosts that group or is one of its Raft peers. A node that holds S's bytes on disk but isn't in S's data replica set is a stray, regardless of its Raft membership.

# Code Quality

## Clippy
After every code change, run clippy + fix all errors before task done:
```sh
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
```
All warnings = errors (`-D warnings`). No `#[allow(...)]` to suppress legitimate warnings — fix underlying issue. Use `#[allow(dead_code)]` only for code intentionally kept for future use or used only in test targets.

## Invariants vs. Rules

Before calling something an invariant, make sure it is one — don't reach for "invariant" to dignify an ordinary behavioral guarantee.

- **Invariant** — a *structural* property: a predicate over current state that is **always** true and checkable on a snapshot, with no notion of time or order. This is exactly what `assert_invariants()` asserts. E.g. "each active range has exactly one active segment"; "`last_applied ≤ commit_index ≤ stabled_index`". If you can't write it as an assertion over present state, it isn't an invariant.
- **Rule** — everything else: behavioral, liveness, and ordering guarantees about what the system *does over time*. E.g. "every event is followed by a flush"; "a seal's end is recovered before the roll"; "catch-up is re-driven until the replica confirms". These have no checkable snapshot — they're enforced by construction or protocol and live in `.claude/rules/`. They do **not** go in `assert_invariants()`.

The confirmation gate below is for **invariants** — they ride in every test via `assert_invariants`, so adding one touches every contributor. Rules are ordinary design: document them, don't gate on them, and don't dress them up as invariants.

## Invariant Checking
State machines (e.g., `MetadataStateMachine`, `Raft`, `Topology`, `MetadataStorage`) have `#[cfg(test)] fn assert_invariants(&self)` methods that verify documented invariants at runtime. These are called automatically after every state-changing operation.

When adding or modifying a state-changing method on any state machine:
1. Ensure the method calls `assert_invariants()` (guarded by `#[cfg(test)]`) after mutation
2. If a new invariant is introduced, add its check to the component's `assert_invariants()`
3. If an invariant is documented in `.claude/rules/` but not checked in `assert_invariants()`, add it

This makes every existing and future test an invariant test automatically — no separate invariant tests needed.

If a code change introduces a new invariant (or modifies an existing one), **always ask the user for confirmation before proceeding** — regardless of the permission mode (auto, plan, default, etc.). Invariants are system-level contracts; adding or changing one affects every test and every future contributor.

## Testing: the data plane under turmoil

turmoil runs SWIM + DS-RSM as cooperative tasks on **one thread under a virtual clock it controls** — the basis of deterministic e2e. In **production** the data plane runs on its **own OS thread** (`DataPlaneActor` → `thread::Builder` + a dedicated current-thread runtime; likewise the cold-read pool and checkpoint worker), doing blocking I/O (WAL/fsync). A real OS thread runs in real wall-time outside turmoil's clock + scheduling — so e2e assertions on its effects would race the virtual clock (the sim fast-forwards virtual time while the real thread still needs real seconds).

So **in `#[cfg(test)]` builds the data-plane workers run as tasks on turmoil's runtime** — the spawn is `#[cfg]`'d (prod = OS thread + own runtime; test = `tokio::spawn`) — sharing the sim's virtual clock and cooperative scheduling, which makes their effects deterministic. Requirements:

1. **Async dispatch, never `blocking_send`.** tokio's `blocking_send` panics inside a runtime, so the worker's flush awaits (`send_batch` / `send_timer_batch`). The worker mailbox is `flume` — sync `recv()` on the prod thread, `recv_async()` on the test task (one channel type).
2. **Every real OS thread in the tested path gets the same `#[cfg]` treatment.** The data-plane worker and the cold-read pool (serves cold/sealed fetches *and* the catch-up source read) both run as tasks under test; a leftover real thread reintroduces the race.
3. **turmoil virtualizes `tokio::time`, NOT `std::time`.** A data-plane timer that must be deterministic uses `tokio::time::Instant` (virtualized on the sim runtime; the seal-retry timeout does). `std::time` stays real wall-time even on the sim runtime — segment `created_at` still uses it — so **drive tests by size-based seal (`size_bytes >= limit`, checked on commit) and event-driven catch-up, never by age** (`created_at.elapsed()` is real-time).
4. Data-plane *logic* is also covered by synchronous `DataPlane` state-machine tests (`src/data_plane/state.rs`) — no clock, no threads, fully deterministic.
5. **A multi-node e2e must pin every nondeterministic input** or the sim isn't reproducible: the turmoil RNG (`Builder::rng_seed` — randomly seeded by default) and node ids (`node_id_suffix` — the default is `{prefix}::{Uuid::new_v4()}`, OS-random, which shuffles the hash ring). Beware per-process `HashMap` order (Rust's `RandomState` is process-random and can't be pinned) — keep order-dependent logic out of the asserted path. **`vnodes_per_node` is now a speed knob, not a correctness one:** low (e.g. 16) means fewer Raft groups → faster sim. At 256 the ~1000 groups pressure SWIM's one-shot shard-leader gossip, so a coordinator can momentarily resolve `MAP-EMPTY` — but the data-plane **topology fallback** (`SendToCoordinator` on `None` → broadcast to the ring's members; the Raft leader acts, followers no-op) recovers it, so repair still completes (the former #135 gap). `sealed_repair_survives_coordinator_crash` runs at 256 deliberately to guard that fallback; the other repair e2es run at 16 for speed.

Also: `crate::net` is `turmoil::net` under `#[cfg(test)]`, so an in-binary `#[tokio::test]` gets simulated sockets — a real-socket harness would need `tests/` (lib links non-test → real `tokio::net`).
