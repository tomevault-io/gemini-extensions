# Shortlist

A private, AI-curated "Picked for You" row for every user on a Plex server. One Docker container:
FastAPI backend + React SPA + SQLite, with a pure-Python engine (per-user watched set read from the
PMS via each share's server token → TMDB similar-titles → LLM curate/explain → per-user Plex
collection + label-restriction privacy).

**Status: 1.0.** In production on the maintainer's server: the FastAPI server runs the engine on
its own nightly schedule (APScheduler), with the React SPA and Docker
packaging. Read these
before any feature work:

- [.claude/docs/shortlist-design.md](docs/shortlist-design.md) — product/UX design (wizard, screens, engine, privacy system)
- [.claude/docs/shortlist-architecture.md](docs/shortlist-architecture.md) — repo layout, DB schema, API surface, testing, CI, phases
- [.claude/docs/jobs-and-runs-design.md](docs/jobs-and-runs-design.md) — runs vs. jobs, the durable
  queue, the delivery ledger, and §12's mutation audit: every state change and whether it actually
  reaches Plex. **Read §12 before touching any handler that changes who can see what** — it is the
  register of a bug class this codebase has had 15 instances of.

Personal deployment details (Steve's servers) live in `CLAUDE.local.md` — gitignored, never commit
it, and never leak environment-specific hostnames/IPs/paths into the public repo or docs.

## Commands

```bash
# Backend
pip install -r requirements.lock && pip install -e ".[dev]"   # lock first: same versions the image ships
pytest                       # unit+integration, parallel, coverage (target ≥80%)
pytest -m e2e                # Playwright vs an in-process app (uvicorn + built SPA) + tests/fakes/fake_plex.py
ruff check . --fix && ruff format .

# Regenerate requirements.lock — REQUIRED whenever pyproject's dependencies change.
# Resolves for the image's interpreter/OS, not your laptop's, so it is safe to run from macOS.
# CI's lint job fails if pyproject declares a dependency the lock doesn't carry.
uv pip compile pyproject.toml \
  --extra anthropic --extra openai --extra google --extra posters \
  --python-version 3.12 --python-platform linux \
  --output-file requirements.lock

# Frontend
pnpm -C web install
pnpm -C web dev              # Vite dev server on :5173; proxies /api to :5959 by default
SHORTLIST_API_PROXY=http://localhost:5960 pnpm -C web dev   # ...or to a scripts/devrun.sh backend
pnpm -C web test             # vitest
pnpm -C web build

# Run (dev) — throwaway config, safe mode, port 5960. Refuses to start if a running container
# already mounts that config dir (two schedulers on one DB duplicates real Plex writes).
bash scripts/devrun.sh
# Overridable: PORT=... SHORTLIST_CONFIG=... SHORTLIST_DRY_RUN=0 bash scripts/devrun.sh
# Under the hood — module-level `app` only exists when SHORTLIST_CONFIG is set:
SHORTLIST_CONFIG=./devconfig uvicorn --factory shortlist.server.main:create_app --reload --port 5960

# Docker
docker build -t shortlist:dev .   # multi-stage: node web build → python runtime
```

## Row privacy (leak-safe ordering)

Rows are made private by share-filter excludes: each account's `filterMovies`/`filterTelevision`
gets `label!=shortlist_<otheruser>` for every row that isn't theirs. The ordering is what keeps it
leak-safe — rows are delivered UNPROMOTED, all filters merged, and only then promoted, so a new row
is never promoted before the exclusions that hide it exist. Unpromoted is not invisible: a row is listed
in the library's Collections tab until its exclude is on an account's filter, so a person's FIRST row is
excluded as soon as it is written, before any other row is — unless plex.tv fails, when the end-of-run
merge does it (plex-safety rule 1).

The old automatic Privacy Check + write gate that _verified_ this before each write was **removed at
the owner's request** (2026-07-16). Writes are no longer gated on a recorded check; the hiding still
happens, but nothing verifies it after the fact — see `.claude/rules/plex-safety.md`.

## Architecture (the one contract that matters)

```
shortlist/engine/    pure library — NO imports from shortlist/server/; takes config dataclasses + clients, returns reports
shortlist/server/    FastAPI + SQLAlchemy/Alembic + APScheduler + SSE; the thin adapter over the engine
web/              React + Vite + TS + Tailwind + shadcn/ui; API types generated from OpenAPI
tests/fakes/      fake_plex.py — stub PMS + plex.tv; e2e runs the full wizard with no real server
```

See shortlist-architecture.md §2–§4 for the full tree, DB schema, and API surface.

## Working economically

Long sessions are the single biggest cost: every turn re-sends the whole conversation. So:

- **Say when a `/clear` is due.** When the next request is a genuinely new task — a different
  feature, a different bug, a different area — say so in one line before starting, and let the owner
  decide. Don't nag mid-task; the cost of losing context you still need is higher than the tokens.
- **Write the test first, then run only that test** (owner decision 2026-09-12). What made testing
  feel like it set the pace of development was running the WHOLE suite mid-edit. Writing the test
  before the code fixes that: it gives you one file to run, and one file is ~3.5s.
  So, during the edit loop: `superpowers:test-driven-development`, then
  `pytest tests/unit/test_foo.py` or `-k <name>` — that file, nothing else. Never `pytest` bare,
  never `-m e2e`, never the whole `pnpm test`, until the work has settled.
  At the END, once: `pytest`, `pnpm test`, `tsc -b --force`, `eslint .`, plus `-m e2e` when a UI flow
  or the wizard changed. That pass is the bar before any commit — CI runs it all regardless, so a
  green full pass immediately before the commit is what counts, not a green one mid-edit.
- **One pytest at a time on this host.** Several agent sessions share it, and each run fans out to
  `PYTEST_XDIST_AUTO_NUM_WORKERS` processes — four overlapping runs is four times that, which is the
  shape that took the plex host down (2026-09-12: 189 workers, ~30 GB into swap). A `PreToolUse` hook
  (`.claude/hooks/pytest-serialize.sh`) denies a `pytest` command while another one is in flight; when
  it fires, wait and retry rather than working around it. Scoped runs stay cheap and stay encouraged —
  it is the OVERLAP that costs, not the frequency.
- **Don't re-verify what a tool already told you.** No re-reading a file you just wrote, no re-running
  a suite after a formatting-only change, no full-suite run to confirm a docs edit.
- **Keep tool output small**: `-q`, `| tail`, targeted `grep`/`sed -n` over dumping whole files.
- **Say when a cheaper model would do.** Before starting a chunk of work, if it is mechanical —
  renames, updating test fixtures to a changed signature, docs, log wording, copy, dependency
  bumps, boilerplate — suggest `/model sonnet` in one line and carry on. Stay on the strong model
  without asking for: diagnosis, anything privacy/migration/identity-shaped, design decisions,
  reviewing someone else's assumptions, and debugging behaviour that isn't yet understood.
- **Run subagents on the cheapest model that can do the job** (`model:` on the Agent tool). Mechanical
  fan-out — grepping, collecting, applying a known edit across many files — is `haiku` or `sonnet`.
  The Architecture Review agent stays on the strong model: its value is catching assumptions nobody
  questioned (it found `immutable=1` unsafe on a WAL database and an episode/show key-space
  mismatch, neither visible without real reasoning). Make it RARE, not cheap.
- **Answer at the length the question deserves.** A yes/no question gets a yes/no and the one caveat
  that matters. Save the long write-up for a diagnosis, a design decision, or something that went
  wrong. Never re-explain what was just said.
- Prove a test has teeth by breaking the code when the logic is **risky or subtle** — not for every
  test. Never use `git checkout <file>` to undo it: that wipes uncommitted work (done twice). Copy to
  a backup first, or re-apply by hand.

## Text the owner is going to paste somewhere

Issue replies, release notes, PR bodies, forum posts — anything written to be copied out of the
terminal:

- **Never use a markdown blockquote (`>`).** The terminal renders it as a leading vertical bar on
  every line, and that bar comes along with the selection — so the paste has to be cleaned up by
  hand, line by line. Put copy-out text in a fenced code block instead, which selects cleanly and
  keeps the markdown intact for GitHub.
- Same reason to avoid tables and hard-wrapped prose in that text: reflow it once and it's ruined.
- Say what the person on the other end has to DO, in its own short paragraph. A diagnosis they
  can't act on is a status update, not a reply.

## Code style

- `ruff format` / `ruff check` (config in pyproject.toml), 120-char lines, 4-space indent
- Type hints on all params and returns; modern annotations (`list[str]`, not `typing.List`)
- Google-style docstrings on public APIs
- Logging: `from loguru import logger` — never stdlib `logging`
- Imports: stdlib → third-party → local
- Frontend rules: `.claude/rules/frontend.md`

## Conventions

- **Branch model** (mirrors media_preview_generator): `dev` is the default/working branch — commit
  and push here; every green `dev` push publishes `ghcr.io/stevezau/shortlist:dev`. `master` is the
  stable branch, advanced only by promoting `dev` → `master` via PR at release time. A `master` push
  runs NOTHING: master only advances by merging a PR that just ran the whole workflow on the same
  content, and the release tag points at that very merge commit, so master and the tag were testing
  one identical SHA twice (v1.7.0 ran the full suite four times over one tree before this was cut).
  The two runs that gate a release are the PR and the tag. Releases are cut by tagging `vX.Y.Z` on
  `master` (CI builds `:latest` + `:X.Y.Z` + `:dev`). Publishing is gated on lint+tests+e2e green.
- **Branch protection.** Force-pushes and deletions are blocked on both branches. `master` also
  requires `lint`/`test-python`/`test-web`/`e2e` — which are GATE jobs (`test-python`/`e2e` just
  assert their `*-shard` matrix legs passed), so the shard count can change without touching branch
  protection. Sharding those jobs under their old names is what blocked the v1.7.0 release PR with
  all checks green: the required contexts had been renamed out of existence and nothing noticed,
  because `dev` requires no checks. `dev` has no required checks on purpose — they
  would block the direct pushes that are how you work on it. `enforce_admins` is off on both,
  leaving an override for a genuine emergency.

  Required checks alone do **not** require a pull request, and this file used to claim they did
  ("only advances via a green PR"). They don't: `v1.0.0` was committed straight to `master` on
  2026-08-04 under exactly that config. Commit the release on `dev` and promote it — a commit that
  lands on `master` alone diverges the branches for real, and the next `dev` → `master` PR reverts
  it silently, because `dev` never had it.

  Ignore GitHub's "`master` is N commits ahead of `dev`". Every PR merge mints a merge commit that
  lives only on the base branch, so that counter can never read 0 and is not drift. The real check
  is content: `git fetch origin && git diff --quiet origin/master origin/dev`.

- **Conventional Commits** (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `chore:`)
- **Architecture Review — by risk, not by habit.** The agent
  (`.claude/agents/architecture-review.md`) costs ~100k tokens a run, so spend it where bugs are
  expensive. Dispatch it, and block on HIGH findings, when the diff:
  - touches **privacy, share filters, restrictions, or anything writing to Plex/plex.tv**;
  - adds or changes an **Alembic migration**;
  - touches **auth, secrets, or tokens**;
  - reads or writes **watch history / user identity** (mapping one person's data onto another);
  - **reads an external system's storage directly** (e.g. the PMS database);
  - is a **`dev` → `master` release PR**, whatever it contains.

  Skip it for UI-only, docs, logging, comments, test-only, and dependency-bump commits — CI and the
  test suite already cover those, and a review there finds style, not bugs.

  NOT "before the PR" alone: a `dev` push deploys to the maintainer's server and to every `:dev`
  user, so risky code is already live by then. The 0032 migration that was a no-op on every real
  database sat on `dev` for days before any PR existed.

- Settings live in the DB (`settings` table via `settings_store`); env vars are one-time seeds
  migrated on first boot (infrastructure vars like `PORT`, `TZ`, `PUID/PGID`, `APP_BASE_PATH` stay live)
- Every schema change ships an Alembic migration
- Docs follow `.claude/rules/docs.md` — README/docs/reference updated in the same PR as the feature

## Security & Plex safety (non-negotiable)

`.claude/rules/plex-safety.md` governs every code path that writes to Plex or plex.tv. Highlights:
snapshot before restriction writes; share filters are read-modify-write MERGES, never rebuilt;
never touch collections/labels Shortlist didn't create (Kometa coexistence); owner never restricted;
tokens encrypted at rest, never logged; everything supports `--dry-run`.

## Key dependencies

Python 3.12 (the Docker runtime; the only version CI tests) | FastAPI | SQLAlchemy 2 + Alembic | APScheduler | plexapi | httpx | loguru | Pydantic v2
