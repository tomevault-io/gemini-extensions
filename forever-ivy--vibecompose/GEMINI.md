# VibeCompose Runbook

## Repo Scope

- Owner/escalation: the VibeCompose product owner for product behavior, installed app state, and release copy.
- This repo owns the native macOS dictation app `VibeCompose`, packaged output under `dist/`, and the installed app path `/Applications/VibeCompose.app`.
- The live app path is authoritative for permission and interaction verification; `dist/VibeCompose.app` is packaging output only.

## Canonical Commands

- Local harness: `scripts/build_and_run.sh`
- Test/check harness: `scripts/check.sh`
- Package app: `scripts/package_app.sh`
- Install packaged app: `scripts/install_app.sh`
- Visual acceptance: `./scripts/visual_acceptance.sh --install`
- Installed TextEdit paste precheck: `./scripts/paste_acceptance.sh --install`
- Installed app smoke: `scripts/check_packaged_app.sh`

## Routine Operations

| Trigger | Command | Expected Result | Failure Recovery |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Implement app behavior fix | `scripts/check.sh` | Unit/integration checks pass | Fix the first failing test; keep paste/permission regressions covered |
| Ship usable local build | `scripts/package_app.sh` then `scripts/install_app.sh` | Fresh `dist/VibeCompose.app` is installed to `/Applications/VibeCompose.app` | Rebuild and reinstall; never launch directly from `dist` for live verification |
| Run visual acceptance | `./scripts/visual_acceptance.sh --install` | Installed app launches through LaunchServices in overlay demo mode and captures recording/processing/verified-insert/paste-sent/copied/error/retryable-error evidence | Inspect generated artifact directory, fix the HUD/state mismatch, and rerun |
| Verify installed TextEdit insertion | `./scripts/paste_acceptance.sh --install` | Installed app launches an isolated TextEdit process, records `inserted_verified`, observes the marker, and restores the previous clipboard only after verification | If Accessibility is false, re-add the newly signed `/Applications/VibeCompose.app`; do not treat an old signing identity's TCC row as proof |
| Verify first-run permissions | Reset TCC for installed app path, then launch `/Applications/VibeCompose.app` | System permission prompt fires from `not determined` state | Do not let setup preflights request permissions before the first-run path is observed |

## Troubleshooting

| Trigger | Command | Expected Result | Failure Recovery |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Output pastes into the wrong place | Inspect focused editable target and run the installed app path | Text sends paste only to the same focused editable target; verified insertion, unverified paste dispatch, and clipboard-only fallback remain distinct | Keep paste behavior conservative and debug AX target/value/range verification before changing STT cleanup |
| HUD or hotkey interaction changed | Use official Computer Use on the installed app | The configured shortcut (default `F5`) starts/stops, `ESC` cancels, inline close cancels, retry/re-entry works, and all three feedback modes preserve the same state semantics | Fix source, rebuild, reinstall, and rerun the full interaction branch |
| Permission flow regresses | Clean TCC state and installed app launch | Accessibility/Microphone prompts appear in the expected order | Add or update automated ordering tests, then repeat installed-app proof |

## Verification

- Verification ladder: unit tests, integration tests, then real installed-app user-flow testing. The first two are prechecks only.
- For native GUI work, use official Computer Use whenever clicks, hotkeys, focus, timing, modal state, permissions, or multi-step interaction are touched.
- VibeCompose Computer Use acceptance should cover: focus a real editable target, start and stop with the configured shortcut (including default `F5` and one custom binding), cancel with `ESC`, cancel with inline close in Refined HUD, retry after cancel/error, switch Refined HUD / Blue Signal Frame / Hidden, and observe paste-versus-clipboard result.
- For closeouts, report the installed-app user flow exercised, the live verification path, the exact outcome observed, and the live VibeCompose state left for review.
- After build, install, scripted visual acceptance, or interaction acceptance, relaunch `/Applications/VibeCompose.app` as the normal installed app and leave it running. General ship closeouts should leave the menu bar app running; Settings or Terminologies work should leave that window visible when practical.

## Release/Deploy

- "Ship it" means run the canonical harness, build, install to `/Applications/VibeCompose.app`, validate installed behavior, and keep release-facing docs current.
- After any fix reaches test/acceptance green, reinstall the freshly built app, launch `/Applications/VibeCompose.app`, verify VibeCompose is still running, and leave it running before reporting completion.
- Launch copy should describe the real public path: browser-based ChatGPT connection, `F5` to record, transcription, and paste-versus-clipboard fallback.

## Guardrails

- Preserve the single-trigger workflow: the configured shortcut starts recording and the same shortcut stops recording; new and reset configurations default to `F5`.
- Do not run `VibeCompose.app` directly from `dist`.
- Do not end an VibeCompose closeout with `pkill -x VibeCompose`, quit, or close. `scripts/install_app.sh` may stop the old app before replacing `/Applications/VibeCompose.app`, and visual demo scripts may stop transient overlay-demo processes, but final closeout must restore the normal installed runtime.
- Keep `.notDetermined` permission paths as their own regression surface.
- Keep the private ChatGPT backend dependency explicit in docs and UX; do not describe it as a stable public API.
- Keep the Public Alpha UI and public documentation on the single ChatGPT OAuth
  provider path. Do not expose the internal OpenAI-compatible recovery
  implementation in first-release product surfaces.

## Known State

- `dist/VibeCompose.app` is build output only.
- `/Applications/VibeCompose.app` is the app path for launch, permission, LaunchAgent, and user-flow proof.

## Browser Automation Constraint
- Follow the global `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` official browser/GUI policy: Browser plugin for unauthenticated local/public rendering, Chrome plugin for signed-in/default-profile browser state, and Computer Use only for native desktop boundaries.
- Keep only repo-specific verification surfaces here; do not copy the full global policy block into this runbook.

## Cursor Cloud specific instructions

Cursor Cloud agents run on a **Linux** VM. The runbook above targets the native
**macOS** app, which CANNOT be built or run here: there is no Swift toolchain and
the app depends on AppKit/Sparkle. Treat `scripts/check.sh`,
`scripts/build_and_run.sh`, `scripts/package_app.sh`, and the `/Applications/VibeCompose.app`
flow as macOS-only and out of scope on Linux.

Two subprojects ARE Linux-runnable and are the working dev scope here:

- **`website/`** — Next.js 15 static-export marketing + Skill catalog site. Commands
  are in `website/README.md` (`pnpm install`, `pnpm dev`, `pnpm build`, `pnpm verify`).
- **`vibecompose-next/`** — cross-platform Rust + Tauri v2 port. Commands are in
  `vibecompose-next/README.md`. CI reference is `.github/workflows/cross-platform.yml`.

Non-obvious environment notes (the update script + base snapshot already handle
dependency install; these are gotchas, not setup steps):

- **Rust toolchain**: the workspace pulls deps requiring the `edition2024` cargo
  feature, so it needs a modern stable toolchain. `rustup default` was set to
  `stable` (1.98+); the base image's older default (1.83) fails to parse the
  dependency manifests. `cargo` is at `/usr/local/cargo` (world-writable, no sudo).
- **Tauri Linux system libs** are preinstalled in the snapshot (same set as CI:
  `libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev libgtk-3-dev libappindicator3-dev librsvg2-dev patchelf
  libasound2-dev libxdo-dev`). They are NOT in the update script.
- **Rust tests**: run `cargo test --workspace --exclude vibecompose-desktop` from
  `vibecompose-next/` (matches CI). The `vibecompose-desktop` crate is excluded from
  tests but compiles with `cargo build -p vibecompose-desktop`.
- **Running the desktop app**: use `npm run tauri dev` from
  `vibecompose-next/apps/desktop` with `DISPLAY=:1` (an X server is available on
  `:1`). A plain `cargo build` debug binary launched standalone shows
  "Could not connect to 127.0.0.1:1420" because a debug build expects the Vite dev
  server (`devUrl`); `tauri dev` starts Vite (`beforeDevCommand`) and wires it up.
  `libEGL ... DRI3` warnings are harmless (software rendering).
- **Website dev server** runs under `basePath` `/vibecompose`; open
  `http://localhost:3000/vibecompose/` (redirects to `/zh-Hans/`), not `/`.
- **`pnpm lint`** (`next lint`) is NOT configured (no ESLint config committed) and
  triggers an interactive first-run prompt — do not use it in automation. Use
  `pnpm build` + `pnpm verify` for website checks.
- **`pnpm verify`**: `build` and `check:catalog` (21 skills) pass. `check:content`
  currently FAILS due to pre-existing copy drift — it expects the literal zh phrase
  `不承诺无限用量`, but `src/content/zh-Hans.ts` uses `不承诺无限` / `不保证无限用量`.
  This is a repository content-contract issue, not an environment problem.
