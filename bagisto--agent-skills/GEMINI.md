## Skills Activation

This project has domain-specific skills available. You MUST activate the relevant skill whenever you work in that domain—don't wait until you're stuck.

- `package-development` — Package development in Bagisto. Activates when creating packages, migrations, models, repositories, routes, controllers, views, localization, DataGrid, menus, ACL, or system configuration. Use references: @core (package structure, service providers), @data (migrations, models, repositories), @ui (routes, controllers, views), @features (localization, DataGrid, menus, ACL, system config).

- `shipping-method-development` — Shipping method development in Bagisto. Activates when creating shipping methods, integrating shipping carriers like FedEx, UPS, DHL, or any third-party shipping provider; or when the user mentions shipping, shipping method, shipping carrier, delivery, or needs to add a new shipping option to checkout.

- `payment-method-development` — Payment gateway development in Bagisto. Activates when creating payment methods, integrating payment gateways like Stripe, PayPal, or any third-party payment processor; or when the user mentions payment, payment gateway, payment method, Stripe, PayPal, or needs to add a new payment option to the checkout.

- `product-type-development` — Product type development in Bagisto. Activates when creating custom product types, defining product behaviors, or implementing specialized product logic. Use references: @config (product type configuration), @abstract (AbstractType methods), @build (complete subscription implementation).

- `shop-theme-development` — Shop theme development in Bagisto. Activates when creating custom storefront themes, modifying shop layouts, building theme packages, or working with Vite-powered assets for the customer-facing side of the application.

- `admin-theme-development` — Admin theme development in Bagisto. Activates when creating custom admin themes, modifying admin layouts, building admin theme packages, or working with admin panel styling and interface customization.

- `pest-testing` — Tests applications using the Pest 3 PHP framework. Activates when writing tests, creating unit or feature tests, adding assertions, testing Livewire components, architecture testing, debugging test failures, working with datasets or mocking; or when the user mentions test, spec, TDD, expects, assertion, coverage, or needs to verify functionality works.

- `blade-conventions` — Blade template conventions for any Bagisto package (Admin, Shop, or a custom Webkul-style module). Activates when creating or editing Blade views, building anonymous `@props` or Vue-backed `x-template` components, wiring forms, datagrids, modals, layouts, or slots; or when matching the project's markup, attribute-binding, indentation, comment, and formatting style.

- `bagisto-api-develop` — Install / remove / extend the `bagisto-api` package (REST + GraphQL). Activates when installing or removing the package, or adding/changing an endpoint, resource, or admin menu's API; or when the user mentions `ApiResource`, `Provider`, `Processor`, `DTO`, "install the package", or "add an endpoint". Install/remove run only on explicit request.

- `bagisto-api-shop` — Build a storefront app/UI on the Shop API (`/api/shop/*` + `/api/graphql`). Activates when building a customer-facing storefront, catalog/cart/checkout flow, customer account, or shopping app; or when the user mentions products, cart, checkout, coupons, wishlist, or customer login/account.

- `bagisto-api-admin` — Build an admin app/UI on the Admin API (`/api/admin/*` + `/api/admin/graphql`). Activates when building an admin dashboard, back-office panel, or an order/catalog/customer/marketing/CMS/settings management screen; or when the user mentions admin orders, products, customers, reporting, or "admin panel on the API".

## Bagisto Architecture

### Package Structure

Every Bagisto package follows a standardized structure:

```
packages/Webkul/{PackageName}/
├── src/
│   ├── Config/
│   │   ├── admin-menu.php
│   │   └── system.php
│   ├── Database/
│   │   ├── Migrations/
│   │   ├── Seeders/
│   │   └── Factories/
│   ├── Http/
│   │   ├── Controllers/
│   │   │   ├── Admin/
│   │   │   └── Shop/
│   │   ├── Middleware/
│   │   └── Requests/
│   ├── Models/
│   │   └── {Package}Proxy.php
│   ├── Repositories/
│   │   └── {Package}Repository.php
│   ├── Resources/
│   │   ├── views/
│   │   ├── lang/
│   │   └── manifest.php
│   └── Providers/
│       └── {Package}ServiceProvider.php
└── composer.json
```

### Repository Pattern

Bagisto uses the Prettus L5 Repository pattern. Always use repositories for data access:

```php
// Correct way - inject the repository and let the container resolve it.
public function __construct(
    protected ProductRepository $productRepository,
) {}

$products = $this->productRepository->all();

// Outside a constructor, resolve it from the container.
$products = app(ProductRepository::class)->all();

// Avoid reaching for the model directly.
$products = Product::all(); // Less preferred
```

### Service Providers

Service providers must:
- Load routes from `Routes/admin-routes.php` and `Routes/shop-routes.php`
- Load migrations automatically
- Load translations from `Resources/lang`
- Load views from `Resources/views`
- Merge package configuration using `$this->mergeConfigFrom()`

## Conventions

- Always follow existing code conventions used in this application.
- Use descriptive names for variables and methods. For example, `isRegisteredForDiscounts`, not `discount()`.
- Check for existing components to reuse before writing new one.
- Use PHPDoc blocks with proper punctuation for all classes and methods.
- Follow the package structure when creating new packages.
- Use repositories for database operations.

## Verification Scripts

- Do not create verification scripts or tinker when tests cover that functionality and prove they work.
- Unit and feature tests are more important than manual verification.

## Application Structure & Architecture

- Stick to existing directory structure; don't create new base folders without approval.
- Do not change the application's dependencies without approval.
- Custom packages should be placed in `packages/Webkul/`.

## Frontend Bundling

- If the user doesn't see a frontend change reflected in the UI, it could mean they need to run `npm run build`, `npm run dev`, or `composer run dev`. Ask them.

## Documentation Files

- You must only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the user.

## Replies

- Be concise in your explanations - focus on what's important rather than explaining obvious details.

=== boost rules ===

# Laravel Boost

Laravel Boost is an MCP server that comes with powerful tools designed specifically for this application. Use them.

## Artisan

- Use the `list-artisan-commands` tool when you need to call an Artisan command to double-check the available parameters.

## URLs

- Whenever you share a project URL with the user, you should use the `get-absolute-url` tool to ensure you're using the correct scheme, domain/IP, and port.

## Tinker / Debugging

- You should use the `tinker` tool when you need to execute PHP to debug code or query Eloquent models directly.
- Use the `database-query` tool when you only need to read from the database.
- Use the `database-schema` tool to inspect table structure before writing migrations or models.

## Reading Browser Logs With the `browser-logs` Tool

- You can read browser logs, errors, and exceptions using the `browser-logs` tool from Boost.
- Only recent browser logs will be useful - ignore old logs.

## Searching Documentation (Critically Important)

- Boost comes with a powerful `search-docs` tool you should use before trying other approaches when working with Laravel or Laravel ecosystem packages.
- This tool automatically passes a list of installed packages and their versions to the remote Boost API, so it returns only version-specific documentation for your circumstance.
- Search the documentation before making code changes to ensure we are taking the correct approach.
- Use multiple, broad, simple, topic-based queries at once. For example: `['rate limiting', 'routing rate limiting', 'routing']`.
- Do not add package names to queries; package information is already shared.

### Available Search Syntax

1. Simple Word Searches with auto-stemming - query=authentication - finds 'authenticate' and 'auth'.
2. Multiple Words (AND Logic) - query=rate limit - finds knowledge containing both "rate" AND "limit".
3. Quoted Phrases (Exact Position) - query="infinite scroll" - words must be adjacent and in that order.
4. Mixed Queries - query=middleware "rate limit" - "middleware" AND exact phrase "rate limit".
5. Multiple Queries - queries=["authentication", "middleware"] - ANY of these terms.

=== php rules ===

# PHP

- Always use curly braces for control structures, even for single-line bodies.

## Constructors

- Use PHP 8 constructor property promotion in `__construct()`.
    - `public function __construct(public GitHub $github) { }`
- Do not allow empty `__construct()` methods with zero parameters unless the constructor is private.

## Type Declarations

- Always use explicit return type declarations for methods and functions.
- Use appropriate PHP type hints for method parameters.

```php
protected function isAccessible(User $user, ?string $path = null): bool
{
    ...
}
```

## Enums

- Typically, keys in an Enum should be TitleCase. For example: `FavoritePerson`, `BestLake`, `Monthly`.

## Comments

- Prefer PHPDoc blocks over inline comments. Never use comments within the code itself unless the logic is exceptionally complex.

## PHPDoc Blocks

- Add useful array shape type definitions when appropriate.
- Always use proper punctuation at the end of descriptions.

=== tests rules ===

# Test Enforcement

- Every change must be programmatically tested. Write a new test or update an existing test, then run the affected tests to make sure they pass.
- Run the minimum number of tests needed to ensure code quality and speed. Use `php artisan test --compact` with a specific filename or filter.

=== laravel/core rules ===

# Do Things the Laravel Way

- Use `php artisan make:` commands to create new files (i.e. migrations, controllers, models, etc.). You can list available Artisan commands using the `list-artisan-commands` tool.
- If you're creating a generic PHP class, use `php artisan make:class`.
- Pass `--no-interaction` to all Artisan commands to ensure they work without user input.

## Database

- Always use proper Eloquent relationship methods with return type hints.
- Use Eloquent models and relationships before suggesting raw database queries.
- Use Repository pattern for Bagisto packages.
- Avoid `DB::`; prefer `Model::query()`. Generate code that leverages Laravel's ORM capabilities.
- Generate code that prevents N+1 query problems by using eager loading.
- Use Laravel's query builder for very complex database operations.

### Model Creation

- When creating new models, create useful factories and seeders for them too. Ask the user if they need any other things, using `list-artisan-commands` to check the available options to `php artisan make:model`.

### APIs & Eloquent Resources

- For APIs, default to using Eloquent API Resources and API versioning unless existing API routes do not, then you should follow existing application convention.

## Controllers & Validation

- Always create Form Request classes for validation rather than inline validation in controllers.
- Check sibling Form Requests to see if the application uses array or string based validation rules.

## Authentication & Authorization

- Use Laravel's built-in authentication and authorization features (gates, policies, Sanctum, etc.).

## URL Generation

- When generating links to other pages, prefer named routes and the `route()` function.

## Queues

- Use queued jobs for time-consuming operations with the `ShouldQueue` interface.

## Configuration

- Use environment variables only in configuration files - never use the `env()` function directly outside of config files.
- Always use `config('app.name')`, not `env('APP_NAME')`.

## Testing

- When creating models for tests, use the factories for the models. Check if the factory has custom states that can be used before manually setting up the model.
- Faker: Use methods such as `$this->faker->word()` or `fake()->randomDigit()`.
- When creating tests, make use of `php artisan make:test [options] {name}` to create a feature test, and pass `--unit` to create a unit test. Most tests should be feature tests.

## Vite Error

- If you receive an "Illuminate\Foundation\ViteException: Unable to locate file in Vite manifest" error, you can run `npm run build` or ask the user to run `npm run dev` or `composer run dev`.

=== laravel/v12 rules ===

# Laravel 12

- CRITICAL: ALWAYS use `search-docs` tool for version-specific Laravel documentation and updated code examples.
- Since Laravel 11, Laravel has a new streamlined file structure which this project uses.

## Laravel 12 Structure

- In Laravel 12, middleware are no longer registered in `app/Http/Kernel.php`.
- Middleware are configured declaratively in `bootstrap/app.php` using `Application::configure()->withMiddleware()`.
- `bootstrap/app.php` is the file to register middleware, exceptions, and routing files.
- `bootstrap/providers.php` contains application specific service providers.
- The `app/Console/Kernel.php` file no longer exists; use `bootstrap/app.php` or `routes/console.php` for console configuration.
- Console commands in `app/Console/Commands/` are automatically available and do not require manual registration.

## Database

- When modifying a column, the migration must include all of the attributes that were previously defined on the column. Otherwise, they will be dropped and lost.
- Laravel 12 allows limiting eagerly loaded records natively, without external packages: `$query->latest()->limit(10);`.

### Models

- Casts can and likely should be set in a `casts()` method on a model rather than the `$casts` property. Follow existing conventions from other models.

=== boost/core rules ===

# Laravel Boost

## Artisan

- Use the `list-artisan-commands` tool when you need to call an Artisan command to double-check the available parameters.

- Only recent browser logs will be useful - ignore old logs.

## Searching Documentation

- Use `search-docs` tool before making code changes to ensure we are taking the correct approach.
- Use multiple, broad, simple, topic-based queries at once.

=== pint/core rules ===

# Laravel Pint Code Formatter

- You must run `vendor/bin/pint --dirty --format agent` before finalizing changes to ensure your code matches the project's expected style.
- Do not run `vendor/bin/pint --test --format agent`, simply run `vendor/bin/pint --format agent` to fix any formatting issues.

=== pest/core rules ===

## Pest

- This project uses Pest for testing. Create tests: `php artisan make:test --pest {name}`.
- Run tests: `php artisan test --compact` or filter: `php artisan test --compact --filter=testName`.
- Do NOT delete tests without approval.
- CRITICAL: ALWAYS use `search-docs` tool for version-specific Pest documentation and updated code examples.
- IMPORTANT: Activate `pest-testing` every time you're working with a Pest or testing-related task.

=== payment-method-development rules ===

# Payment Gateway Development

- CRITICAL: ALWAYS use the payment-method-development skill when working with payment methods in Bagisto.
- Payment methods in Bagisto are located in `packages/Webkul/Payment/src/Payment/` and `packages/Webkul/Paypal/src/Payment/`.
- All payment methods extend `Webkul\Payment\Payment\Payment` abstract class.
- Payment configuration is defined in `Config/payment-methods.php` files.
- System configuration for admin panel is defined in `Config/system.php` files.
- Service providers must merge payment method configuration using `$this->mergeConfigFrom()`.
- Always follow the existing code patterns and PHPDoc conventions when creating payment methods.
- For testing payment methods, refer to `packages/Webkul/Shop/tests/Feature/Checkout/CheckoutTest.php`.

=== shipping-method-development rules ===

# Shipping Method Development

- CRITICAL: ALWAYS use the shipping-method-development skill when working with shipping methods in Bagisto.
- Shipping methods in Bagisto are located in `packages/Webkul/Shipping/src/Carriers/`.
- All shipping methods extend `Webkul\Shipping\Carriers\AbstractShipping` abstract class.
- Shipping carrier configuration is defined in `Config/carriers.php` files.
- System configuration for admin panel is defined in `Config/system.php` files.
- Service providers must merge carrier configuration using `$this->mergeConfigFrom()`.
- Always follow the existing code patterns and PHPDoc conventions when creating shipping methods.
- Use `core()->convertPrice()` for multi-currency support when setting prices.
- Check `$item->getTypeInstance()->isStockable()` for per-item shipping calculations.

=== blade-conventions rules ===

# Blade Conventions

- CRITICAL: ALWAYS use the blade-conventions skill when creating or editing any `.blade.php` file.
- Binding: `attr="text"` is a literal, `:attr="expr"` is a Blade/PHP expression, `::attr="expr"` escapes to a literal `:attr` for Vue. Getting `:` vs `::` wrong is the most common source of bugs.
- Reuse the globally registered `x-admin::` / `x-shop::` components and layouts; prefix only your own new components with your package namespace.
- Vue-backed components: `<v-name>` wrapper + `<script type="text/x-template" id="v-name-template">` + `app.component("v-name", ...)`, all inside `@pushOnce('scripts')` … `@endPushOnce`. Emit runtime values as `@{{ … }}`.
- Formatting: 4 spaces; more than one attribute means one per line with the closing `>` on its own line; a single attribute stays inline; no blank lines between a tag's attributes; one blank line between sibling blocks.
- Align the `=>` in Blade `@props`/arrays. Do NOT align them in real `.php` files — Pint single-spaces those.
- Comments follow the layer they sit in: `{{-- --}}` for Blade/PHP notes, `<!-- -->` for markup section dividers, and `/** … */` JSDoc blocks inside `<script>` and `<style>` — never `//` or bare `/* */` there.
- Comment casing: a sentence is capitalized and punctuated; a bare title/label is Title Case with no trailing period.
- Never hardcode UI strings — use `@lang('<ns>::app…')`, and add new keys to every locale.
- Gate admin actions with `@if (bouncer()->hasPermission('resource.action'))`.
- Bracket meaningful content with `{!! view_render_event('bagisto.<area>.<path>.before') !!}` / `.after`.

=== package-development rules ===

# Package Development

- CRITICAL: ALWAYS use the package-development skill when creating packages in Bagisto.
- Use the Bagisto Package Generator (`composer require bagisto/bagisto-package-generator`) for quick setup.
- Package structure must follow the standardized layout in `packages/Webkul/`.
- Service providers must be registered in `bootstrap/providers.php`.
- Always run `composer dump-autoload` after adding new packages.
- Break a condition with more than one clause (`&&` / `||`) across lines, operator leading each line; keep single-clause conditions inline. Pint does not enforce this — see the skill's PHP Code Style section.
- Use references: @core for structure/service providers, @data for models/migrations, @ui for routes/controllers/views, @features for localization/DataGrid/menus/ACL/config.

#### @core - Core
- Use `$this->loadMigrationsFrom()`, `$this->loadRoutesFrom()`, `$this->loadViewsFrom()`, `$this->loadTranslationsFrom()` in service provider boot() method.
- Use `$this->mergeConfigFrom()` in service provider register() method for config merging.
- Register models in ModuleServiceProvider using Concord for proxy resolution.

#### @data - Data Layer
- Use migrations in `src/Database/Migrations/` for database schema.
- Always create Contract, Model, and Proxy for each data entity (three-component model system).
- Use Prettus L5 Repository pattern for data access (extends `Webkul\Core\Eloquent\Repository`).
- Repository model() method must return the contract class path, not the model class.
- Use package prefix for table names (e.g., `rma_requests` instead of `return_requests`).
- Register models in `config/concord.php` via ModuleServiceProvider.

#### @ui - UI Layer
- Routes must be in `src/Routes/admin-routes.php` and `src/Routes/shop-routes.php`.
- Admin routes use middleware `['web', 'admin']` with prefix from `config('app.admin_url')`.
- Shop routes use middleware `['web', 'locale', 'theme', 'currency']`.
- Controllers must extend package base Controller which extends `Illuminate\Routing\Controller`.
- Use dependency injection for repositories in controllers.
- Use `<x-admin::layouts>` and `<x-shop::layouts>` for Blade views.
- Use `<x-admin::datagrid>` component for admin tables.
- Views must be loaded with namespace prefix (e.g., `rma::admin.return-requests.index`).

#### @features - Features
- Translation files go in `src/Resources/lang/{locale}/` and use namespace `rma::`.
- DataGrid classes extend `Webkul\DataGrid\DataGrid` and are placed in `src/DataGrids/Admin/`.
- Admin menu is configured in `src/Config/admin-menu.php` and merged to `menu.admin`.
- ACL is configured in `src/Config/acl.php` and merged to `acl`.
- System configuration is in `src/Config/system.php` and merged to `core`.
- Use `core()->getConfigData('key.path')` to retrieve configuration values.
- Use `bouncer()->hasPermission('key')` to check ACL permissions in controllers and views.

=== product-type-development rules ===

# Product Type Development

- CRITICAL: ALWAYS use the product-type-development skill when working with product types in Bagisto.
- Product types extend `Webkul\Product\Type\AbstractType` base class.
- Product type configuration is defined in `Config/product-types.php` files.
- Use references: @config for configuration structure, @abstract for AbstractType methods, @build for complete implementation.
- Product types must be registered in service provider using `$this->mergeConfigFrom()`.
- Key methods to override: `isSaleable()`, `isStockable()`, `showQuantityBox()`, `haveSufficientQuantity()`, `prepareForCart()`, `getTypeValidationRules()`.
- Use `$additionalViews` for custom admin interface sections.
- Use `$skipAttributes` to hide irrelevant attributes for product type.

=== api-platform-development rules ===

# Bagisto API Platform (REST + GraphQL)

- CRITICAL: use the `bagisto-api-develop` skill when installing / removing / extending the `bagisto-api` package; use `bagisto-api-shop` or `bagisto-api-admin` when building an app or UI on the API.
- Two surfaces: **Storefront** — `/api/shop/*` (REST) + `/api/graphql`, authed by the `X-STOREFRONT-KEY` header (plus a customer or guest-cart Bearer token for cart/account calls). **Admin** — `/api/admin/*` (REST) + `/api/admin/graphql`, authed by a pre-issued admin Integration Bearer token. The admin API mirrors the admin panel menu-for-menu.
- The api-docs (`https://api-docs.bagisto.com` and its `/llms.txt` index) are the source of truth for exact request/response shapes — open the endpoint page; never invent a payload from memory.
- GraphQL `id` is selectable only on fetchable (noun) resources (product, customer, order). Action/result mutations (cart writes, place-order, cancel, comment) return result fields (`cartId`, `orderId`, `success`, `message`) — never `id`. GraphQL inputs are camelCase.
- Admin collections return a `{ data, meta }` envelope; storefront paginated collections expose `X-Total-*` headers; page size is `?per_page=N` (+ `?page=N`).
- Extending the package: REST + GraphQL share the same Provider/Processor — any change to one must keep the other working, so run the resource's GraphQL test before the REST test. Mirror the admin panel, not a superset. No auto-commit — the user commits.
