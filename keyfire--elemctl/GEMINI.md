# Repository conventions

elemctl is a public, international project: a CLI, an MCP server and a Python library for the
1C:Enterprise.Element Console API v2. The contract the tool implements lives in
[docs/SPEC.md](docs/SPEC.md), with a Russian twin in `docs/SPEC.ru.md`. This file records how
the repository itself is written.

## Language of the code

- **Code is English.** Comments, docstrings, identifiers, test names – all of them, in `src/`,
  `tests/`, `tools/` and `editors/`. The code is read by people who do not speak Russian.
- **Russian stays where it faces the user**: the i18n message catalog (`src/elemctl/i18n.py`),
  argparse help strings, user-facing strings, the MCP tool descriptions and the server
  `INSTRUCTIONS` literal. An agent reads those in Russian.
- **Platform identifiers are quoted as they are**: `Проект.yaml`, `Ресурсы`, `Имя`, `Поставщик`,
  `ВидПроекта`, `ОбластьВидимости` and the like are real keys and file names, so do not
  translate them. The same goes for the Russian data of test fixtures.

## Typography

Applies to English text as well:

- dashes – en dash `–` (U+2013) only, never an em dash;
- quotes – straight `"` and `'`, never guillemets or curly quotes;
- ellipsis – three dots `...`, never the `…` character.

## Russian without borrowed words

The Russian edition kept drifting into English written in Cyrillic letters. An entry said that
a `пин` had been raised after a `прогон`, and the reader had to translate both before the
sentence meant anything. The words and the Russian to write instead live in the `docsguard`
package. This repository only says which of its documents are Russian, in
`scripts/check_docs.py`: the pages under `docs/` are found by pattern, the README, the changelog
and this file by name.

A word quoted as a word goes in backticks. `пин` inside them is a name being discussed rather
than a word being used, and the guard reads it as a name, the way it reads a fenced block, a
link target and a file name. The caption of a command is written the same way, whoever the
command belongs to.

## Nothing internal

The repository is public. It must not carry internal project identifiers, stand names, real
application or assembly ids, internal hosts, issue keys or machine paths. That holds for the
code, for comments and for test fixtures alike. Use neutral examples: vendors `acme` and
`globex`, applications `crm-dev` and `demo-app`.

A text also says what was wrong, never who asked for the change. Reviews and decisions happen
off the page, and the person who writes the code here is the person who owns it, so a line
about an owner asking for something reads as if there were someone else above the author.
"The sentences ran to five lines and the words read as transliteration" says the same thing and
survives being read by a stranger.

## Documentation pairs

English and Russian pages go together: `README.md` / `README.ru.md`, `docs/SPEC.md` /
`docs/SPEC.ru.md`, `CHANGELOG.md` / `CHANGELOG.ru.md` and the rest of `docs/*.md`. A change
to one side without the other is an unfinished change. Four pages are generated, so never edit
them by hand:

- `docs/cli.md` / `docs/cli.ru.md` – from the output of `elemctl ... --help`;
- `docs/changelog.md` / `docs/changelog.ru.md` – from the root `CHANGELOG` editions.

One command rebuilds all of them: `python scripts/rebuild-docs.py`. It is the only one to
remember. Every generator used to carry a command of its own, and each of those turned into
something else to remember. The mirrors were the first to be left behind, and `main` went red
on the guard for it.

The pull request link that every changelog entry ends with is written by
`python scripts/changelog-link.py <number>` rather than by hand. It appends the link to every
entry of the topmost section in both editions and rebuilds the generated pages in the same run.
The link and the rebuild are two halves of one step, and doing the first by hand is how the
second gets forgotten.

## One fact, one wording

A statement about the platform is told in several places at once: the specification, the
Console API page, the MCP page, the README, the docstrings of the code. Then it gets corrected
in one of them. Twice that left the rest telling the model it replaced, and one document ended
up carrying both at the same time. Such statements are listed as `CLAIMS` in
`scripts/check_docs.py`. A row names the places that must state the fact, the spellings that
count as stating it, and the spellings of the model it replaced. Those old spellings may appear
nowhere but the changelog, where an entry about a correction quotes what it corrected.
Correcting such a fact means correcting every place the claim names, and the guard says which
one was missed. A fact that starts living in more than one place gets a row of its own. The
judging itself comes from the shared `docsguard` package, because the neighbouring repositories
keep their documentation the same way and have the same defect waiting. What lives here is the
table.

## The shared guard

The parts of the documentation guard that three repositories were keeping in triplicate live in
the `docsguard` package, which the workflows install from git. It is fixed to a tag, never to
`@main`. From the main branch, any change made there would reach a run here in the middle of
unrelated work, and a red run caused by no commit of ours is a red run nobody reads. The order
of merging, the shared package first and this repository second, was also left to memory rather
than written down.

So raising the version is a change of its own, with its own pull request: `docsguard` tags
`v<version>` right after its own merge, and the tag goes up here. Every workflow names the same
tag, and `tests/test_workflows.py` fails when they drift apart. A suite passing against one
version of the guard while the publication runs against another is exactly the difference
nobody looks for.

## Starting a process

A process started from here is read as text, and the text is decoded explicitly:
`capture_output=True, text=True, encoding="utf-8"`, plus `errors="replace"` wherever the output
only goes to a human. Without `encoding`, Python decodes with the code page of the console, and
the failure is silent in the worst way. A generator named the Russian pages it writes, the names
came back as replacement characters, the output was lost, and the exit code went on saying that
everything had gone well. A call that asks for no text at all, bytes in and bytes out, decodes
nothing and needs neither argument.

The other half of the agreement belongs to the child process. A plain Python script encodes its
own stream with that same code page, so a script started from here is given
`PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8`. The elemctl CLI reconfigures its streams itself; a script does not.

A process started from here also names its stdin: `stdin=subprocess.DEVNULL`. elemctl ships an
MCP server, and under that server stdin is the pipe the client speaks over. On Windows a child
that inherits the handle never reaches its own exit. The work takes milliseconds, the parent
waits out the whole timeout, and nothing is printed while it waits. Whether that hurts depends
on the command: `tasklist`, `powershell` and `cmd` close their end and leave, while git, an
interpreter and pip stay. That is how a build came to report git as unavailable on a repository
git was perfectly happy with. Nothing here ever writes to a child, so an empty stdin costs
nothing. A call that does feed one, through `input=` or an `stdin=` of its own, is left alone.

`tests/test_conventions.py` fails on a process read as text without an encoding. It catches the
`(run or subprocess.run)(...)` shape of a runner seam too, which is the shape the offending call
had and which a search for the text of a call looks straight past. The reading itself comes from
the shared `docsguard` package, because the neighbouring repositories start processes the same
way and have the same silent failure waiting. What stays here is the list of folders: which of
them hold code that starts processes is a fact about this repository.

The stdin half is judged over `src` alone. A script, a tool and a test run from a console, and a
console stdin is safe to hand on.

## Writing a file

A text file written from here names `newline=""`. Without it, `write_text` and `open` in text
mode translate the line feed into the platform's ending, so a generator that rewrites a page on
Windows hands back a file with every line changed. `core.autocrlf=input` normalizes that away on
commit and hides it, which is exactly the trouble: on a machine without the setting, the whole
file goes to this public repository as a line-ending change nobody asked for. The script that
appends a pull request link to both changelog editions was doing just that, and the mirrors it
rebuilds in the same run took the change with them, while the two generators beside it were
already spelling the keyword out.

The same `tests/test_conventions.py` fails on a text write that does not name it, and it reads
the sources with `ast` again: a write is `p.write_text(...)` or an `open` in a text write mode,
while bytes and reads are left alone. The list of folders is shorter here than the process
convention takes. A test writes into a temporary directory that is gone when the run ends, and a
fixture carrying the other line ending on purpose is a test in its own right.

That keyword is half of the answer, because it says how a file is WRITTEN. A file read with
carriage returns in it carries them onward, and `scripts/sync-docs.mjs` splices a section of one
document into another by copying the bytes it was handed - which is how the READMEs came out
mixed. The other half is `.gitattributes`: `* text=auto eol=lf` stores and checks out every text
file with line feeds, whatever the machine is set to. `core.autocrlf=input` says the same thing
and says it about the machine, so it holds only until the first checkout made without it.

## Naming a test

A test named like an existing one takes its place. Python keeps the last definition, pytest
collects what the module ended up with, and the number of tests goes up, because the newcomer
was added. Nothing in the run says the older test is gone.

`tests/test_conventions.py` runs `shadowed_test_problems` over `tests`, and the finding names
the line of the newcomer, which is the definition to rename. Each namespace is judged on its
own, so two classes are still allowed a method of the same name.

## Tests

`python -m pytest -q` runs the suite without network access, with the transport stubbed. CI runs
it too, on every push to `main` and on pull requests (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`), and again
before publishing on a `v*` tag. Anything that depends on the environment, `CI_*` variables and
the like, has to be neutralized by a fixture, otherwise it passes locally and fails in CI.

## Release

The version lives in `src/elemctl/__init__.py` alone, and `pyproject.toml` reads it dynamically.
A release is a version bump, a `CHANGELOG` section for the day and an annotated `v<version>`
tag. Publishing to PyPI happens in CI through Trusted Publishing.
