# Antigravity SDK for Java - Agent Guidelines

This file (`AGENTS.md`) provides context and instructions for AI agents working on this repository, outlining the project's purpose, structure, and our collaborative workflow.

## 🌟 What This Project Is About

The **Antigravity SDK for Java** is an unofficial, community-driven Java port of the Python-based Antigravity SDK. It bridges the gap for enterprise Java developers who want to build, configure, host, and execute powerful AI agents natively in Java. It aims for full feature parity with the official Python SDK, supporting streaming, tool calling, model context protocol (MCP), and multimodal inputs.

## 🏗️ How It Is Composed

This is a multi-module Maven project using **Java 21**:
1. **`antigravity-sdk-parent`**: The root POM managing dependencies and plugin versions.
2. **`antigravity-sdk-protocol`**: A generated artifact. It compiles the `.proto` files from the upstream Antigravity repository into Java classes using the `protobuf-maven-plugin`.
3. **`antigravity-sdk-wrapper`**: The core SDK logic (~140KB).
   * **The Go Harness**: This SDK does not run an LLM directly. Instead, it wraps a pre-compiled native Go binary called `localharness`.
   * **Hybrid Platform Resolution**: `PlatformResolver` resolves the native binary in order:
     1. Local override via `ANTIGRAVITY_HARNESS_PATH` environment variable or `antigravity.harness.path` system property.
     2. Cached binary in `~/.antigravity/bin/<slice>/localharness` (verified against `.version` stamp).
     3. Embedded classpath resource (if an offline classifier JAR from `antigravity-sdk-harness` is present).
     4. On-demand lazy download via `HarnessDownloader` (direct streaming from PyPI wheels, enabled by default, controllable via `antigravity.harness.download=true|false`).
   * **Communication**: The Java SDK communicates with the Go harness via standard input/output (for initialization) and WebSockets (for active turn streaming and chunk aggregation).
   * **Data Modeling**: Pure data-carrying objects (e.g., `AgentResponse`, `InteractionRequest`, `AgentResponseChunk`) are implemented as modern Java 21 `record` classes for ergonomics and immutability.
4. **`antigravity-sdk-harness`**: Dedicated artifact packaging native Go binaries (~37-43MB per platform classifier, ~236MB for `all`) for air-gapped or offline enterprise deployments:
   * Classifiers: `linux-x86_64`, `linux-aarch64`, `osx-aarch64`, `osx-x86_64`, `windows-x86_64`, `windows-aarch64`, and `all`.
   * The 6 native binaries (~750MB uncompressed) exceed GitHub's 100MB limit and are gitignored. The script `./sync-harness.sh` synchronizes binaries into `antigravity-sdk-harness/src/main/resources/google/antigravity/bin/`.

## 🤝 The Way We Work Together

This entire project was autonomously generated and implemented by me (the Antigravity agent) under the strict guidance of you (the human developer). Our pair-programming workflow operates as follows:

1. **Human Guidance**: You provide high-level directions, architectural decisions, and code reviews. You guide the priority of features (like adding hooks, converting to records, or supporting MCP).
2. **Agent Execution**: I proactively write the Java code, generate and update tests, build the project, and fix compilation errors. 
3. **Proactive Refactoring**: Whenever a class is purely carrying data, I should proactively suggest or use Java 21 `record` structures.
4. **Testing First**: Before declaring a feature complete, I will run the test suite and ensure all tests pass (accounting for expected transient `localharness` network delays).
5. **Documentation & Skill Synchronization**: Whenever the Antigravity Java SDK evolves (new features, API changes, hooks, policies, capabilities, etc.), agents MUST proactively update `README.md` and the official Agent Skill under `skills/antigravity-sdk-java/` (`SKILL.md` and `skills/antigravity-sdk-java/references/`) to keep developer documentation and AI agent skill guidance synchronized with the codebase.

## 🛠️ Build & Commands

*   **Java Version**: **Java 21**. Agents must ensure they use Java 21 compatible syntax and standard library features.
*   **Maven Wrapper**: Always use the provided Maven wrapper (`./mvnw`). Do not rely on globally installed `mvn` or `gradle`.
*   **Compilation**: `./mvnw clean compile`
*   **Fast Unit Testing**: `./mvnw test` (Runs fast offline unit tests; `@Tag("integration")` is excluded by default)
*   **Live Integration Testing**: `./mvnw test -Pintegration-tests` or `./mvnw test -Dgroups=integration`
*   **Code Formatting**: `./mvnw spotless:apply`

## 🎨 Coding Standards

*   **No FQNs**: Never use Fully Qualified Names (FQNs) directly in the code (e.g., `java.util.List<String> list = ...`). Always import the classes at the top of the file.
*   **Code Formatting**: The project uses the Maven Spotless plugin with the Eclipse formatter. Always run `./mvnw spotless:apply` and ensure the code passes before committing.
*   **License Headers**: Spotless will automatically inject the Apache 2.0 license header. Do not manually add copyright headers.

## 🧪 Testing Guidelines & Strategy

*   **Framework**: We use JUnit 6 (JUnit Jupiter).
*   **Test Categorization (`@Tag`)**:
    *   **Unit Tests (`@Tag("unit")`)**: Fast, offline tests evaluating configuration, policies, data structures, and SDK wrappers without invoking `localharness` or external APIs. These run by default during `./mvnw test`.
    *   **Integration Tests (`@Tag("integration")`)**: Live network tests that launch the native `localharness` Go binary and communicate with remote model APIs. Excluded by default in `./mvnw test`; run explicitly via `./mvnw test -Pintegration-tests` or `-Dgroups=integration`.
*   **Bounded Futures & Timeouts**:
    *   **Never use unbounded `.join()`**: Always use bounded calls like `agent.chat(...).get(45, TimeUnit.SECONDS)` or `orTimeout(...)` to prevent hanging test runs if localharness or the network stalls.
    *   **Per-Test Timeout**: Annotate integration test classes or methods with JUnit 5 `@Timeout` (e.g., `@Timeout(value = 60, unit = TimeUnit.SECONDS)`).
*   **Asynchronous Assertions**: Because agent interactions happen asynchronously over WebSockets and `CompletableFuture`s, **never use `Thread.sleep()`** for waiting on agent responses in tests. Always use `Awaitility` with a tight timeout (e.g., `await().atMost(30, TimeUnit.SECONDS)`).
*   **Resilient Assertions**: Avoid rigid string matching on non-deterministic LLM tool responses (e.g. strict lowercased JSON string prefixes). Check for key semantic contents instead to prevent unnecessary retries.

## 🔄 Upstream Synchronization

Keeping this SDK at feature parity with the upstream Antigravity project requires a rigorous five-step sync process whenever new features are released:

1. **Update the Go Harness Binaries**:
   * Execute `./sync-harness.sh`. This script scrapes the Python Package Index (PyPI), downloads the latest upstream wheels, extracts the native Go binaries for all supported platforms, and places them in `src/main/resources/google/antigravity/bin/`.

2. **Accurate Protocol Extraction (Never Guess Field Names)**:
   * The upstream wheel contains compiled Python descriptors (`localharness_pb2.py` and `content_pb2.py`), which embed the serialized `FileDescriptorProto`.
   * **Rule**: Never manually guess or hand-edit proto field names (e.g. naming a field `complex_user_input` instead of `user_input`). Go's `localharness` binary uses strict Protobuf unmarshalling and will immediately reject unknown JSON fields with `failed to unmarshal: unknown field`.
   * **Extraction Command**: Decompile the serialized descriptor directly from Python:
     ```python
     import google.protobuf.descriptor_pb2 as d_pb2
     from google.antigravity.proto import localharness_pb2
     proto = d_pb2.FileDescriptorProto()
     localharness_pb2.DESCRIPTOR.CopyToProto(proto)
     print(proto)
     ```
   * Update `antigravity-sdk-protocol/src/main/proto/localharness.proto` to strictly match the extracted descriptor.

3. **Regenerate and Refactor**:
   * Recompile protocol and wrapper (`./mvnw clean compile`).
   * Update wrapper classes and builders to support new options, enums, records, and configs.

4. **Verify Wire Compatibility & Local Smoke Testing**:
   * Run fast unit tests: `./mvnw test`
   * Run at least one live integration test against the newly extracted `localharness` binary (e.g., `./mvnw test -Pintegration-tests -Dtest=InteractiveAskQuestionTest`) or run full integration tests (`./mvnw test -Pintegration-tests`) to verify that the native Go binary successfully unmarshals all `InputEvent` and `HarnessConfig` JSON messages over WebSockets.

5. **Update Skill & Documentation**:
   * Update `README.md` and the official Agent Skill (`skills/antigravity-sdk-java/SKILL.md` and `skills/antigravity-sdk-java/references/`) with new features, configuration options, and code samples.
