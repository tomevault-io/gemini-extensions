# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

nnInteractive is a 3D interactive medical image segmentation framework. It supports diverse prompt types (points, scribbles, bounding boxes, lasso) using 2D interactions to generate full 3D segmentations. This repository contains the **inference-only** package.

## Build & Development Commands

```bash
# Install from source (editable). This repo builds TWO distributions that share the
# `nnInteractive` namespace (see "Two-distribution layout" below): the torch-free client
# must be installed first because the full package depends on it.
pip install -e ./client   # nninteractive-client (torch-free wire client)
pip install -e .          # nnInteractive (full stack; depends on the client)

# Install with dev tools
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Code formatting
black nnInteractive/

# Linting
ruff check nnInteractive/ --fix

# Spell checking
codespell --skip='.git,*.pdf,*.svg'

# Pre-commit hooks (after: pre-commit install)
pre-commit run --all-files
```

There is no test suite in this repository.

## Architecture

### Two-distribution layout (full package + lightweight client)

The repo builds **two pip distributions** that share the single `nnInteractive` import namespace:

- **`nninteractive-client`** — source under `client/`. Ships *only* `nnInteractive.inference.remote`
  (the torch-free remote client + the shared wire protocol/serialization). Depends on just
  `numpy`, `httpx`, `blosc2`. Built from `client/pyproject.toml`.
- **`nnInteractive`** (full) — source at the repo root. Ships everything else (local engine,
  server, model management, …) and **depends on `nninteractive-client`**. Built from the root
  `pyproject.toml`.

How the shared namespace works:
- `nnInteractive` and `nnInteractive.inference` are **PEP 420 namespace packages** — neither
  has an `__init__.py`; the two distributions populate disjoint files into the same directory.
  Both builds therefore use `namespaces = true`, and the full build `exclude`s
  `nnInteractive.inference.remote*` (client-owned) and `nnInteractive.supervoxel*` (separate
  package). **Do not add an `__init__.py` to either of those two dirs** — it would make the two
  distributions ship the same file and break the clean split.
- Because the layout is layered (disjoint files, full *depends on* client), the two coexist
  cleanly: `pip install nnInteractive` pulls the client; uninstalling the client leaves the full
  install intact; a client-only machine upgrades with `pip install nnInteractive` (no uninstall).
- There is **no `nnInteractive.__version__`** (namespace package has no module to carry it).
  Read the version via `importlib.metadata.version("nnInteractive")` /
  `version("nninteractive-client")`. `nnInteractiveInferenceSession.INFERENCE_SESSION_VERSION`
  does exactly this.
- Full-only imports from a client-only install raise a friendly "`pip install nnInteractive`"
  error via a last-resort `sys.meta_path` finder registered in
  `client/nnInteractive/inference/remote/_full_required.py` (installed when the remote client is
  imported). It is a no-op when the full package is present.
- The full server (`server/app.py`) imports the wire serialization from
  `nnInteractive.inference.remote.serialization`, which is now provided by the client dependency.

### Core Class: `nnInteractiveInferenceSession` (`nnInteractive/inference/inference_session.py`)

Session-based inference engine (~2000 lines) that manages state across multiple predictions. This is the main user-facing API.

**Workflow**: `initialize_from_trained_model_folder()` → `set_image()` → `set_target_buffer()` → `add_*_interaction()` (repeatable)

- **Background threading**: Image preprocessing and interaction initialization run in a ThreadPoolExecutor (max 2 workers) via futures
- **AutoZoom**: Adaptive patch selection with border change detection; zooms out up to 4x if predictions touch crop boundaries
- **Refinement**: After coarse prediction, difference maps identify regions needing fine-grained re-prediction
- **Memory management**: Selective CPU/GPU transfers, pre-allocated tensors, half-precision interactions, pinned memory (disabled on Linux kernel 6.11)

**Important API constraints**:
- `use_torch_compile` is supported. The session default is `False`, but the **server enables it by default** (disable with `--no-torch-compile`). When enabled, the first prediction is slow (lazy compilation on the first forward pass) but subsequent ones are faster; the one-time compile cost is amortized across the long-lived server process. `nnInteractiveInferenceSession.warmup()` runs a single dummy forward pass at the network's only input shape (`[1, num_input_channels + num_interaction_channels, *patch_size]` — every prediction path uses this shape) to trigger compilation up front; the server calls it at startup so clients never see the first-prediction delay
- `target_buffer` must be 3D (shape `[X, Y, Z]`), not 4D
- Scribble and lasso images must match `original_image_shape[1:]` (the original uncropped spatial shape)
- `add_initial_seg_interaction()` **resets all existing interactions** (see WARNING in its docstring)
- `reset_interactions()` also clears the target buffer
- If multiple `add_*_interaction()` calls are made without calling `_predict()`, only the last added interaction center is used for the initial prediction (all centers are queued, but only the last is consumed)
- Images should **not** be preprocessed (no normalization, no level-window). The session handles all preprocessing internally

### 7-Channel Interaction Tensor Layout

The interaction tensor has shape `[7, D, H, W]` in half precision (but can vary — `num_interaction_channels` is set from `capability['interaction_channels']`):
| Channel | Content |
|---------|---------|
| 0 | Initial segmentation |
| 1 | Positive bounding box / Lasso |
| 2 | Negative bounding box / Lasso |
| 3 | Positive points |
| 4 | Negative points |
| 5 | Positive scribble |
| 6 | Negative scribble |

### Capability / Channel Mapping System

`initialize_from_trained_model_folder()` reads model metadata from:
1. `inference_info.json` (new format) — contains `supported_interactions`, `channel_mapping`, `interaction_channels`, `interaction_decay`, `point_radius`, etc.
2. `inference_session_class.json` (legacy format) — falls back to hardcoded defaults

The capability system (`_apply_capability()`) normalizes all channel indices to positive values at load time. Channel mappings use pairs `[pos_channel, neg_channel]` for interactions and a single index for `prev_seg`.

### Model Checkpoint Structure

A trained model folder must contain:
- `inference_info.json` (or legacy `inference_session_class.json`)
- `dataset.json`
- `plans.json`
- `fold_{N}/checkpoint_final.pth` (or `fold_all/` for ensemble)

A trained model folder may also contain:
- `LICENSE` — the model's license. **Only the first non-empty line is read** and exposed as `session.license` (a short identifier, e.g. `CC BY-NC-SA 4.0`); any following lines (URL, full license text, …) are for human readers and are ignored. If the file is absent the loader falls back to the official-checkpoint heuristic (`_is_official_checkpoint` → `CC BY-NC-SA 4.0`), otherwise it reports `!!MISSING!!`. The license is printed on load and surfaced over the remote `/capabilities` endpoint so GUIs can display it.

Official weights are hosted on HuggingFace at `MIC-DKFZ/nnInteractive`. The selectable models are enumerated by a `models.json` manifest at the root of that HF repo (not of this git repo); discovery/download is handled by `nnInteractive/model_management.py` (`list_models`, `ensure_model_available`, `get_default_model_id`), which stores models under `$NNINTERACTIVE_MODEL_DIR` (default `~/.nninteractive`). The default model is currently `nnInteractive_v1.0`.

### Key Modules

- **`nnInteractive/interaction/point.py`**: Point interaction with spherical structuring elements and distance transforms. `build_point()` uses `lru_cache` for structuring element reuse.
- **`nnInteractive/trainer/nnInteractiveTrainer.py`**: Minimal stub extending nnUNetv2. Used only for architecture reconstruction from checkpoints. Adds 7 extra input channels (`num_input_channels + 7`) on top of image channels.
- **`nnInteractive/utils/crop.py`**: Tensor cropping/padding with boundary handling (`crop_and_pad_into_buffer`, `paste_tensor`, `crop_to_valid`, `pad_cropped`)
- **`nnInteractive/utils/bboxes.py`**: Greedy set cover algorithm for generating refinement patch bounding boxes from difference maps; falls back to random sampling when recursion depth exceeds `max_depth`
- **`nnInteractive/utils/erosion_dilation.py`**: `iterative_3x3_same_padding_pool3d` — used for dilation of point/scribble channels before downsampling (zoom-out) and for morphological opening of the diff map
- **`nnInteractive/utils/checkpoint_cleansing.py`**: Utility to strip optimizer state and trainer class from checkpoints before release
- **`nnInteractive/inference/cvpr2025_challenge_baseline/predict.py`**: Reference script for the CVPR 2025 challenge baseline (stateless per-call API wrapper around `nnInteractiveInferenceSession`)
- **`nnInteractive/supervoxel/`**: Optional separate module for SAM-based supervoxel generation (has its own `pyproject.toml` and installation)

### Key Dependencies

- **`nnunetv2`** (>=2.7.0): Provides network architecture, ConfigurationManager, PlansManager, preprocessing pipeline
- **`torch`** (>=2.1.2, !=2.9.*): PyTorch 2.9 is excluded due to OOM bugs with 3D convolutions
- **`acvl-utils`** (>=0.2.3, <0.3): Spatial operations (cropping, padding)

### Coordinate System

Images are 4D numpy arrays `[C, X, Y, Z]`. Images are intentionally **not** cropped during preprocessing: interactions, predictions and the target buffer all live in the original image's coordinate space, so all `add_*_interaction()` coordinates are used as-is (the nonzero region is located only to compute normalization statistics).

Bounding box coordinates use `[[x1, x2], [y1, y2], [z1, z2]]` half-open intervals throughout. Current pretrained models only support **2D bounding boxes** (one dimension must have size 1).

### `_predict()` Implementation Notes

The `_predict()` method (decorated with `@torch.inference_mode()`) is highly optimized for minimal VRAM usage. Comments in the code note that the implementation has been extensively tuned and changes should only be made after fully understanding the VRAM/timing implications. The method:
1. Runs an initial coarse prediction at `zoom_out_factor`
2. Detects changes at prediction borders (`_detect_change_at_border`) and iteratively zooms out (up to 4x, growth factor 1.5) if needed
3. If `zoom_out_factor == 1`: directly pastes prediction into interactions and target buffer
4. If `zoom_out_factor > 1`: computes a diff map, morphologically opens it, then runs refinement patches via `_refine_coarse()`

### Platform Workarounds

- Linux kernel 6.11 detection (`utils/os_shennanigans.py`) disables pinned memory due to a kernel bug
- `interaction_decay` (default 0.98, legacy 0.9) downweights older interaction channels (all except `prev_seg`) on each prediction cycle
