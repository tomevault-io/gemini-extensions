# Repository Guidelines

## Project Overview

This repository implements a Nano-style information retrieval benchmark runner
for SentenceTransformers-compatible models and BM25 baselines.

Library code lives under `hakari_bench/`. Built-in dataset definitions live
under `config/datasets/`, and dataset collection definitions live under
`config/dataset_collections/`.

## Environment

- Use Python 3.12.
- Use `uv` for dependency management and command execution.
- Add runtime dependencies with `uv add`.
- Add development-only dependencies with `uv add --dev`.
- Keep `uv.lock` updated when dependencies change.
- Keep `transformers>=4` and `sentence-transformers>=5` compatibility.

## Development Workflow

- Follow TDD for behavioral changes: add or update focused tests before changing
  implementation when practical.
- Keep changes scoped to the existing module boundaries:
  - `cli.py` for command-line parsing and orchestration.
  - `datasets.py` for dataset specs, collections, split/task resolution.
  - `evaluation.py` for dataset loading and dense/sparse/reranker scoring.
  - `bm25.py` for BM25 baseline evaluation, candidate generation, and tokenizer
    dispatch.
  - `metrics.py` for IR metric calculation.
  - `models.py` for model loading and runtime/model metadata.
  - `results.py` for output paths, cache behavior, and JSON payloads.
- Prefer YAML dataset configuration over hard-coded dataset lists.
- Do not commit generated benchmark outputs, caches, or local scratch artifacts.
  `output/` and `tmp/` are intentionally ignored.

## Documentation

- Write project documentation in English unless the user explicitly requests
  another language.
- Keep reusable project workflows under `docs/`, not only under `skills/`.
  Skill files may point to the canonical docs, but they should not be the only
  place where benchmark or metadata procedures are described.
- Start with [`docs/index.md`](docs/index.md) when you need the human- and
  agent-facing map of canonical docs, workflow routes, and artifact boundaries.
- Use these docs as the main entry points when searching for repository
  procedures:

## Evaluation Execution

- Before running or scheduling benchmark evaluations, read
  `docs/evaluation_runbook.md` for the practical evaluate-build-viewer
  workflow and `docs/evaluation_policy.md` as the source of truth for
  prompt/runtime choices, embedding variant policy, and result coverage audits.
- Prefer the attention implementation officially recommended by the evaluated
  model. Use explicit `--attn-implementation sdpa`, `--flash-attn2`, or
  `--attn-implementation flash_attention_2` when appropriate; leaving attention
  unspecified can make long benchmark runs substantially slower for some models.
- Dense evaluation automatically includes full-dimension `int8,binary` and
  `rescore:int8,binary` variants unless `--no-default-embedding-variants` is
  used. When dense truncation dims are supplied with
  `--embedding-variant truncate:DIMS`, the CLI also expands them into standalone
  truncation plus truncation x quantized/rescore variants.
- If a requested dense truncate dimension matches the encoded base embedding
  dimension, evaluation warns and skips that no-op truncate variant because it
  duplicates the original full-dimension result.
- After benchmark runs, audit result coverage before reporting or rebuilding
  leaderboard comparisons. Confirm base task completeness and verify that every
  intended variant category exists for each model.
- When comparing a new run against existing model data, prefer the cached remote
  DuckDB, such as
  `~/.cache/hakari-bench/duckdb/remote_latest_hakari_bench.duckdb` or the synced
  Hugging Face snapshot DuckDB, instead of reading raw result JSON or `.json.xz`
  files directly. Direct JSON reads are rarely needed for existing remote
  results and should be reserved for local run outputs or schema/debug work.

## Leaderboard Viewer

- For leaderboard viewer design changes, read `@DESIGN.md` first and keep
  design-specific rules there.
- Before and after implementing viewer or DuckDB-related changes, benchmark
  representative queries against a freshly updated latest remote DuckDB cache.
  Record comparable timings, preserve the established filter and calculation
  order, and do not accept material regressions in unrelated viewer paths.
- When updating viewer UI design, check `@DESIGN.md` before editing and update
  it when the design direction, tokens, layout rules, or component behavior
  changes.
- After changing the leaderboard viewer, install Playwright Chromium and run the
  browser test before considering the work complete. This is required for
  changes to viewer behavior, queries, URL/state restoration, filters, design,
  layout, interactive controls, generated HTML, CSS, or JavaScript:

  ```bash
  uv run --only-group viewer-browser-test playwright install chromium
  uv run --only-group viewer-browser-test pytest -q -m browser tests/test_viewer_browser.py
  ```

  `uv run tox -e browser` is the CI-style shortcut for the same workflow; it
  installs Chromium before running the browser test. Do not skip this validation
  merely because focused unit tests pass. If the browser test cannot run, report
  the reason explicitly and do not describe the viewer change as fully verified.

- When updating the leaderboard viewer in this project, keep
  `docs/duckdb_schema.md` in sync. Update it when DuckDB schema, viewer queries,
  leaderboard semantics, score grouping, variant handling, or required columns
  change.
- The served stylesheet `hakari_bench/viewer/assets/app.css` is a compiled,
  minified Tailwind output. Never hand-edit it. Edit the source
  `hakari_bench/viewer/assets/app.tailwind.css`, then rebuild and commit both:

  ```bash
  uv run python scripts/build_viewer_css.py            # rebuild app.css
  uv run python scripts/build_viewer_css.py --watch    # rebuild on change
  uv run python scripts/build_viewer_css.py --check     # verify in sync
  ```

  The build pins the Tailwind version for reproducible output and needs Node's
  `npx` on PATH. `uv run tox -e css` runs the `--check` in CI-style validation.
  New Tailwind utility classes used in viewer `.py`/`.js` only appear after a
  rebuild.

## Validation

Run the full validation suite before committing:

```bash
uv run tox
```

For quicker iteration, use:

```bash
uv run --group all pytest -q
uv run ruff check .
uv run --group all ty check
```

## Model Loading

- The default evaluation method is `evaluate dense`, loaded with
  `SentenceTransformer`.
- Supported evaluation method subcommands are `dense`, `sparse`, `reranker`,
  `late-interaction`, and `bm25`.
- `sparse` uses SentenceTransformers `SparseEncoder`.
- `reranker` uses SentenceTransformers `CrossEncoder` and requires a candidate
  ranking such as `bm25`; `--rerank-top-k` limits the candidates to rerank.
- `late-interaction` uses PyLate ColBERT and scores query/document token
  embeddings with exact MaxSim.
- Default dtype is `bf16`. Keep `--dtype`, `--trust-remote-code`,
  `--flash-attn2`, `--attn-implementation`, `--device`,
  `--model-max-seq-length`, `--truncate-dim`,
  `--sparse-query-max-active-dims`, and `--sparse-document-max-active-dims`
  explicit CLI options.
- If no attention implementation is specified for model evaluation, the CLI
  warns and delegates to the Transformers/model default. Treat that as a prompt
  to confirm the model's official recommendation before launching long runs.
- Do not shorten model max sequence length for benchmark runs just to avoid
  slow execution or memory pressure. Use the model's default/configured maximum
  length unless the user explicitly requests a different value. If memory errors
  happen, first reduce batch size or adjust execution options; changing
  `--model-max-seq-length` makes results less comparable and must be called out
  clearly in the result metadata and summary.
- Prompt overrides are optional. If no prompt or prompt name is provided,
  preserve SentenceTransformers model prompt behavior.

## BM25 Behavior

- BM25 evaluation supports two sources:
  - By default, read the selected dataset candidate subset
    (`--candidate-ranking`, default `bm25`) and use that ranking as the BM25
    baseline.
  - Use local `bm25s` computation only when explicitly requested with
    `--bm25-source computed`, or from `build-candidates bm25` when generating
    BM25 candidate subsets.
- If the default dataset subset is unavailable, fail with an actionable error
  instead of silently recomputing BM25 locally.
- Local BM25 uses `bm25s` with the standard Okapi-style Robertson method.
- If `--bm25-tokenizer` is omitted for local BM25, auto-select the tokenizer
  from task metadata first and then from 10 sampled queries detected with
  `fast-langdetect`. Tasks marked `category: code` use `regex`; natural
  language tasks use `wordseg`, `english_porter_stop`, Snowball `stemmer`,
  `whitespace`, or `regex` according to the tokenizer policy in
  `docs/create_nano_datasets.md` and task metadata.
- Supported BM25 tokenizers are `regex`, `whitespace`, `transformer`, `stemmer`,
  `english_regex`, `english_porter`, `english_porter_stop`, and `wordseg`.
- `wordseg` support is optional. Keep language-specific dependencies behind the
  `wordseg` extra and lazy-load them only when the tokenizer is selected.
  Current wordseg languages are `ja`, `zh`, `th`, `ko`, and `vi`.
- Nano dataset BM25 candidate subsets used for top-100 reranking diagnostics
  should force qrels positives into the final top-k candidate list and record
  `candidate_coverage`. Query and relevant coverage should be 100% unless the
  dataset README and metadata explicitly document why that is impossible.
- Persist the resolved BM25 source, backend, algorithm, tokenizer, and candidate
  subset metadata in result JSON under `config.bm25` and `model.bm25`.

## Results and Metadata

- Per-task result files are written below:

```text
output/hakari-results/{model_id}/{huggingface_dataset_name}/{split_or_task}.json.xz
```

- Run-level summaries are derived from per-task result JSON when building the
  DuckDB database; do not write aggregate result files.
- `scripts/build_results_database_and_report.py` accepts repeated
  `--results-dir` options for merging multiple result roots. Treat the argument
  order as the merge priority: the first directory wins for duplicate
  `model_name`/task JSON, and later directories only fill missing results.
  Use `--overwrite-result-duplicates` when later directories should replace
  duplicate logical model-task rows from earlier directories.
  `model_name` comes from result JSON `model.id`; do not use `model_dir` as
  part of the logical model identity.
- DuckDB builds default to streaming result rows into DuckDB. Use
  `--materialize-results-in-python` only for the legacy materialized path or
  `--html-output` when a static HTML report is required.
- When rebuilding the canonical leaderboard DuckDB from the latest Hugging Face
  dataset results, use `scripts/sync_remote_results_and_rebuild.py` instead of
  pointing the builder at ad hoc local result directories. Prefer
  `--sync-backend xet` for the large Hugging Face results dataset; it keeps a
  git checkout under
  `~/.cache/hakari-bench/hf-datasets/hakari-bench__results__xet`, fetches with
  LFS smudge disabled, runs `git reset --hard FETCH_HEAD`, installs the local
  Git Xet transfer agent with `git xet install --local --path ...`, removes
  stale untracked files with `git clean -fdx`, and pulls only
  `hakari-results/**` LFS payloads. Existing local Git LFS/Xet cache objects
  should be reused. The rebuilt DuckDB should be written outside the checkout
  under `output/clean-hf-results-duckdb/{checkout-name}/hakari_bench.duckdb` so
  the cached Hugging Face results repo remains git-clean. The plain `git`
  backend remains available when Git Xet must not be installed. Use
  `--skip-git-sync` only when intentionally rebuilding from the existing local
  cache without cleaning or syncing.
- Use `--append-results-dir` when adding a separate root containing only new
  model-task JSON to an existing DuckDB. This mode is append-only and should
  reject duplicate result paths or duplicate logical model-task rows.
  If the target DuckDB is missing and no local base is supplied, append mode
  should download the configured latest remote DuckDB before adding results.
  Use `--append-base-duckdb` plus `--append-output-duckdb` when a new merged DB
  should be created from an existing base, and `--model-name-override` only when
  the append directory represents one logical model.
- Existing result files should be skipped unless `--overwrite` is provided.
- Result JSON should preserve as much runtime detail as practical, including
  batch size, dtype, package versions, torch/CUDA info, prompts, total
  parameters, trainable parameters, embedding parameters, transformer/active
  parameters, evaluation timestamps, dataset load duration, and evaluation
  timing.
- Active parameters are currently computed as total parameters minus input
  embedding parameters when both counts are available.

## Dataset Configuration

- Add new datasets as YAML files under `config/datasets/`.
- Add grouped benchmark definitions under `config/dataset_collections/`.
- Keep dataset specs generic enough to handle:
  - datasets split by task,
  - datasets not split by task,
  - collection-style benchmarks such as `MNanoBEIR`.
- `MNanoBEIR` is defined as a built-in collection in
  `config/dataset_collections/mnanobeir.yaml`.
- Keep the evaluation task count distinct from the leaderboard Overall count.
  A complete model evaluation runs and preserves 563 task results, including
  `NanoBEIR-en` as the English component of `MNanoBEIR`. The viewer excludes 13
  overlapping Nano task copies through `config/viewer/benchmarks.yaml`, so the
  Overall score is calculated from 550 tasks. The excluded results must remain
  in the results dataset; see `docs/benchmark_scope.md` for the rationale and
  exact task list.
- Built-in dataset names should stay consistent across docs, configs, and tests:
  `NanoBEIR-en`, `MNanoBEIR`, `NanoMIRACL`, `NanoMLDR`, `NanoJMTEB`,
  `NanoRTEB`, `NanoMTEB`, `NanoCMTEB`, `NanoMMTEB`, `NanoFaMTEB`,
  `NanoRuMTEB`, `NanoVNMTEB`, `NanoMTEB-BR`, `NanoMTEB-Misc`, `NanoLongEmbed`, and
  `NanoCoIR`.
