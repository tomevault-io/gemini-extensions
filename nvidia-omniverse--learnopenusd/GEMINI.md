# AGENTS.md - AI Agent Guide for Learn OpenUSD Repository

This guide provides AI agents with comprehensive information on how to work with the Learn OpenUSD repository. Whether creating new content, reviewing changes, running tests, or using this repository as a knowledge base for OpenUSD questions, this document will help you navigate and contribute effectively.

## Repository Overview

**Learn OpenUSD** is an open-source documentation website that provides a complete learning path for OpenUSD (Universal Scene Description) development. The repository prepares developers for the OpenUSD Development Certification.

### Key Information
- **Purpose**: Educational documentation for OpenUSD with interactive examples
- **Tech Stack**: 
  - Sphinx (documentation generator)
  - MyST-NB (Jupyter notebooks as Markdown)
  - Python with OpenUSD (usd-core)
  - Git LFS (for images, videos, USD files)
- **Package Manager**: uv (for dependency management)
- **License**: Apache 2.0
- **Website**: https://docs.nvidia.com/learn-openusd/latest/index.html

## Quick Start Commands

### Building the Documentation

```bash
# Build HTML documentation
uv run sphinx-build -M html docs/ docs/_build/

# Clean build (remove cached outputs)
rm -rf docs/_build/

# Serve locally for preview
uv run python -m http.server 8000 -d docs/_build/html/
# Then open http://localhost:8000 in a browser
```

### Important Notes
- The build must complete without new Sphinx warnings or errors. There are 163 warnings in a typical build that are acceptable.
- The repository uses Git LFS for large files (images, videos, USD assets)
- Python 3.12+ is required (specified in `pyproject.toml`)

## Content Structure and Conventions

### Style Guide

For detailed formatting conventions, MyST Markdown syntax, and writing guidelines, see **[STYLEGUIDE.md](STYLEGUIDE.md)**.

Key points:
- All documentation uses **MyST Markdown** (Markedly Structured Text)
- USD terminology should be **lowercase** unless at the start of a sentence (e.g., "prim" not "Prim")
- Correct spelling for all USD terms is defined in `docs/glossary.md`
- Link glossary terms on first use with the `{term}` role
- Files with executable Python code use **Jupytext** frontmatter

### File Organization

- **Images**: Place in `docs/images/<module-name>/` (PNG, JPG, GIF, WEBM, MP4)
- **Exercise files**: Store in `docs/exercise_content/<module-name>/`
- **Lesson assets**: Create `_assets/` subdirectories within lesson folders for build-time lesson assets.
- ZIP files are auto-generated during build from `exercise_content/` subdirectories

## Creating New Content

### Adding a New Lesson to an Existing Module

1. **Create the Markdown file** in the appropriate module directory (e.g., `docs/stage-setting/new-lesson.md`)
2. **Add the license header to files with executable code**
3. **Write the content** using MyST Markdown with appropriate directives
4. **Add to the module's index** by editing the `index.md` toctree in that module
5. **Add images** to `docs/images/<module-name>/`
6. **Test the build** to ensure no errors

### Creating a New Module

1. **Create the module directory** in `docs/` (e.g., `docs/my-new-module/`)
2. **Create an `index.md`** file as the module landing page
3. **Add subdirectories** for lessons if needed
4. **Create `setup.md`** if the module requires exercise files
5. **Add the module** to the main `docs/index.md` toctree
6. **Create exercise content** in `docs/exercise_content/my_new_module/`
7. **Add images** in `docs/images/my-new-module/`
