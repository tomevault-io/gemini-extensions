> REA exposes reverse-engineering tools through a CLI and MCP server. Hopper and the bring-your-own Ghidra adapter are operation-capable deep binary-analysis providers. Ghidra is supported on Linux x64 and has an experimental Windows x64 P0 boundary for approved native x86-64 PE applications; it supplies admitted read-only inventory and function-analysis operations but no GUI or mutation authority. Keep provider-specific code out of the domain and application layers.

# Repository Guidelines

## Product Direction

REA exposes reverse-engineering tools through a CLI and MCP server. Hopper and the bring-your-own Ghidra adapter are operation-capable deep binary-analysis providers. Ghidra is supported on Linux x64 and has an experimental Windows x64 P0 boundary for approved native x86-64 PE applications; it supplies admitted read-only inventory and function-analysis operations but no GUI or mutation authority. Keep provider-specific code out of the domain and application layers.

Prioritize:

- tool results that distinguish observations, inferences, and unknowns;
- equivalent behavior through the CLI and MCP;
- additive, idempotent configuration with backups;
- end-to-end tests for packaged artifacts and real Hopper/Ghidra claims.

Installers must not install or upgrade Homebrew, Node.js, npm, Java, Ghidra, or other unrelated software. Ghidra is bring-your-own. `rea setup` must print its planned changes and require approval before writing files or installing Hopper.

REA is a local-only tool; do not sanitize actionable local diagnostics such as artifact paths, digests, mismatch locations, or analysis metadata, while continuing to redact genuine secrets such as credentials and authorization headers.

## Project Structure & Module Organization

REA is a layered ESM TypeScript application. Dependencies flow inward: `domain` underlies `contracts` and the shared `process` primitives; providers depend on those layers, followed by `application`, `server`, and the entry adapters.

See [docs/architecture.mermaid](docs/architecture.mermaid) for a visual architecture diagram.

- `scripts/rea.mjs`: executable dispatcher. Routes only bare `mcp` and `--mcp` to the production stdio server; Incur handles registration utilities and one-shot commands.
- `src/main.ts`: MCP adapter. Parses config, wires the shared session runtime, starts stdio transport, and owns process-lifetime shutdown.
- `src/cli.ts`: one-shot CLI adapter for setup, diagnostics, analysis, and decompilation.
- `src/config.ts`: Zod-validated parsing of environment configuration into `AppConfig`.
- `src/domain/`: pure, side-effect-free modules. `errors.ts` owns the tagged error algebra; `result.ts` owns `Result`/`ok`/`err`; `hopperValues.ts` owns shared function-dossier values plus Hopper boundary parsers; `symbolAnalysis.ts` parses Swift/ObjC names; `javascriptApplicationGraph.ts` validates and canonically commits the provider-neutral JavaScript Application Graph; `javascriptStaticAnalysis.ts` performs bounded AST-only JavaScript structure recovery.
- `src/contracts/`: caller-visible tool schemas and catalog metadata; `toolContracts.ts` owns the canonical inventory and `enhancedInputs.ts` owns enhanced input parsing.
- `src/process/`: provider-neutral process ownership and lifecycle primitives. It owns private runtime roots, session-assigned run identity and token-verified lineage, absolute startup deadlines, correlated request waits, bounded output capture, and TERM-to-KILL cleanup without defining any provider wire protocol.
- `src/replay/`: Linux x64 controlled-JavaScript-replay adapter. It owns exact runtime closure inspection, Bubblewrap/seccomp/cgroup admission, the disposable worker, strict parent/worker protocol validation, and complete cleanup observation.
- `src/browser/`: loopback CDP/Inspector discovery, bounded WebSocket transport, exact-origin or canonical-root target authorization, passive browser/Electron and attach-only Node/Electron V8 observation, plus controlled Playwright scenarios with explicit launch/attach ownership and cleanup.
- `src/hopper/`: Hopper launch and Unix-socket protocol mechanics. `BridgeLauncher.ts` spawns the Hopper app with the in-process bridge, `HopperClient.ts` correlates request/response over the socket with timeouts and cancellation, `protocol.ts` frames bridge messages.
- `bridge/hopper_bridge.py`: runs inside Hopper and adapts declared operations to Hopper's public Python API. Hopper's bundled MCP server is not used.
- `src/ghidra/`: exact Ghidra 12.1.2/JDK 21 inspection, analysis-profile commitment, digest-bound target snapshots, isolated `analyzeHeadless` launch, authenticated Unix-socket or Windows loopback transport, bounded serial request queue, and strict inventory/function boundaries.
- `src/dotnet/`: execution-free managed PE/CLI inspection. It owns bounded PE, CLI metadata, heap, table, and resource parsing for `rea-dotnet-static`; it must never load, reflect, execute, decompile, or resolve target assemblies.
- `bridge/ghidra/ReaGhidraBridge.java`: packaged read-only `HeadlessScript` loaded through Ghidra's `scriptPath`; it owns the persistent decompiler and adapts admitted inventory, function, reference, and CFG operations to public Ghidra APIs.
- `src/application/`: shared CLI/MCP session composition, setup and diagnostics, and enhanced workflows. `AnalysisProviderRegistry` discovers overlapping deep candidates without starting them; `SessionProviderRouter` binds one candidate per target and composes it with disjoint auxiliary providers; `JavaScriptArtifactReconstruction.ts` safely projects local directories/ASARs and inert bundle syntax into the application graph without adding a caller-visible tool yet.
- `src/server/`: MCP request translation. `createServer.ts` assembles the MCP server, `registerOfficialTools.ts`/`registerEnhancedTools.ts` register each tool set, `toolResult.ts` maps `Result` values to MCP content.
- `docs/product-catalog.json`: generated package, tool-family, provider, setup-client, schema-version, and CLI facts. Regenerate it from source; do not edit it by hand.
- `tests/`: Vitest suite. `tests/fixtures/` holds reusable provider-process fixtures, source-owned synthetic JavaScript graph and Electron/Webpack/Rspack artifact trees, and the fake launcher, Hopper bridge, and CDP seams.
- `scripts/verify-real-hopper.mjs`: real-Hopper end-to-end verifier.
- `scripts/verify-real-ghidra.mjs`: real Linux Ghidra verifier for x86-64 debug/stripped ELF, AArch64 ELF, PE, and Mach-O function semantics plus complete cleanup.
- `scripts/verify-real-ghidra-windows.mjs`: real Windows x64 Ghidra P0 verifier for the source-owned native PE fixture, all 19 admitted operations, digest linkage, loopback transport, and cleanup.
- `scripts/verify-real-browser.mjs`: real Chrome end-to-end verifier for the passive CDP provider.
- `scripts/print-mcp-config.mjs`: prints an MCP server config with absolute paths filled in (`npm run config:print -- /path/to/binary`).

- `npm run docs:check`: verify generated package metadata, the canonical product catalog, caller-visible documentation facts, TypeDoc rendering, and the error JSON schema.

Local full-suite Vitest runs use one worker and serial project groups because
boundary tests own subprocess fixtures. CI retains the existing two-worker
budget. The `test`, `docs:check`, and `docs:generate` commands use
repository-local locks and refuse overlapping runs; interrupted commands can
leave a stale lock that is removed automatically when its owner PID is no
longer alive. The `npm test` build runs inside that lock.

- `npm run config:print -- /path/to/binary`: print an MCP server config with absolute paths.
- `HOPPER_TARGET_PATH=/path/to/binary npm start`: launch Hopper and run the built stdio MCP server.

Pre-commit hooks via Husky format then lint staged source files. Pre-push runs `npm run check:fast`; CI owns the broader static and generated-document gates. Use `npm run lint:fix` to auto-correct violations locally.

## Configuration & Environment Variables

- `REA_ANALYSIS_PROVIDER` (optional, default `auto`): require one deep-analysis provider ID for startup and one-shot commands, or use deterministic automatic selection. A request-level `provider_id`/`--provider` takes precedence.
- `GHIDRA_INSTALL_DIR` (optional): absolute root of an extracted official Ghidra 12.1.2 distribution. The adapter supports Linux x64 and the experimental Windows x64 P0 boundary documented in `docs/windows-ghidra-p0.md`.

- `REA_V8_INSPECTOR_FILE_ROOTS_JSON` (optional): canonical filesystem roots approved for Inspector targets and script locations.
- `REA_V8_INSPECTOR_ALLOWED_ORIGINS_JSON` (optional): exact HTTP(S) origins approved for Electron renderer Inspector targets and scripts.
- `REA_INVESTIGATION_INPUT_ROOTS_JSON` (optional): canonical filesystem roots approved for static JavaScript/Electron application analysis and other investigation inputs.
- `REA_JAVASCRIPT_REPLAY_ENABLED` (optional, default `false`): add controlled extracted-module execution authority to the administrator ceiling.
- `REA_JAVASCRIPT_REPLAY_ROOTS_JSON` (optional): exact canonical source roots approved for controlled replay.
- `REA_JAVASCRIPT_REPLAY_NODE_PATH`, `REA_JAVASCRIPT_REPLAY_BWRAP_PATH`, `REA_JAVASCRIPT_REPLAY_SYSTEMD_RUN_PATH`, `REA_JAVASCRIPT_REPLAY_SYSTEMCTL_PATH`, and `REA_JAVASCRIPT_REPLAY_SHELL_PATH` (optional): absolute paths committed by each replay plan; defaults target the current Node runtime and standard Linux system executables.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

Use ESM TypeScript, two-space indentation, and Prettier defaults. Keep compiler strictness intact (`strict`, `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`, `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, `verbatimModuleSyntax`). Use `camelCase` for values/functions, `PascalCase` for classes/types, and `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for constants. Parse unknown values at every MCP, environment, and subprocess boundary. Avoid `any`, unchecked casts, non-null assertions, import-time I/O, and floating promises. Exported APIs require concise JSDoc. Model expected failures with the tagged error algebra and `Result`, not broad exception wrappers.

## Testing Guidelines

Name tests `*.test.ts`. Use Vitest and production seams (`tests/fixtures/`) rather than module mocks. Domain tests assert pure behavior; adapter tests use fake launcher/socket seams; MCP tests connect with the client SDK version pinned in `package.json`. Preserve the canonical tool inventory defined by `TOOL_CONTRACTS` and verified through `CATALOG_IDENTITY` and generated product metadata. Cover malformed input, cancellation, timeouts, process exit, concurrency, limits, and clean shutdown. Real Hopper, Ghidra, browser, JavaScript replay, managed conformance, and any real managed-tool claims cannot be replaced by mocks; use the corresponding `verify:*` command.

MCP tools are agent-computer interfaces. Optimize them first for successful agent use: distinct purposes, clear names and parameters, relevant result context, actionable errors, and realistic multi-step workflows. Validate tool-design changes with representative agent tasks and transcripts when possible; schema validity and transport success alone do not prove that a tool is easy for an agent to use.

MCP tool catalogs must remain complete and self-describing. Prefer capability- and session-scoped tool advertisement over schema truncation. Never use serialized byte counts as a proxy for model-context cost, token use, tool usability, or agent performance. Measure bytes only when evaluating a named transport, storage, or protocol constraint. Any model-context or token-efficiency claim must identify the client and its actual model-facing projection and tokenizer, since clients may omit, transform, dereference, or otherwise reproject MCP schemas. Do not weaken names, descriptions, schemas, examples, errors, or result context to improve a byte-based metric.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

Use Conventional Commit subjects because Release Please derives versions and changelogs from them. Examples: `feat: add historical source import`, `fix(process): stop timers after exit`, and `docs: update architecture`. Use `!` or a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer for breaking changes. Pull request titles must follow the same format because squash merges use the title as the release commit. Pull requests should describe contract or behavior changes, list verification commands, link issues, and include sanitized MCP examples when schemas change. State whether real Hopper/Ghidra verification was performed. Never commit binaries, Hopper or Ghidra project documents, credentials, `dist/`, `node_modules/`, or local planning artifacts (e.g. `.codex/`).
