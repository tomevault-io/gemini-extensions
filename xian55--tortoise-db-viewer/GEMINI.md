Guidance for working in this repo. See `README.md` for the user-facing overview.

## What this is

A static, single-page item/NPC/dungeon database for Tortoise-WoW (a 1.12 MaNGOS
fork), hosted on GitHub Pages at https://xian55.github.io/tortoise-db-viewer/.
There is **no backend**: the whole SQLite DB is shipped and queried in the
browser with the official `@sqlite.org/sqlite-wasm` build.

## Architecture (how it fits together)

```
../tortoise-wow/sql/base/*.sql        server MaNGOS SQL dumps (base world data)
../tortoise-wow/sql/database_updates/  incremental world migrations (patch content:
   *.sql                               new zones/NPCs/objects/quests). mangosd
                                       applies these at runtime; the build does too.
        │  scripts/build-db.mjs        stage raw tables -> apply migrations (in
        │                              timestamp order) -> normalize + index +
        │                              resolve chances
        ▼
public/data/tortoise.sqlite           one indexed DB (~34 MB), fetched whole
        │  src/db.js + src/db-worker.js (sqlite-wasm in a Worker, OPFS cache)
        ▼
src/queries.js  → src/table.js / src/render.js / src/hovercard.js / src/browse.js

F:/Game/Turtle WoW/Data/*.mpq         client patch MPQs (Turtle custom content)
        │  scripts/extract-icons.py    LOCAL ONLY — needs the client + StormLib
        ▼

scripts/data/item-display-supplement.json  committed: display_id -> icon, for every
                                      item row missing/stale in the server SQL dump
        │  scripts/build-atlas.py      pack icons into one sprite sheet
        ▼
public/icons/custom-atlas.{webp,json} the shippable atlas (render.js draws sprites)
```

- **Whole-DB load, not HTTP range.** GitHub Pages gzips responses (including 206
  partials) with `Content-Range` reporting the *compressed* size, which corrupts
  byte-range reads — so sql.js-httpvfs is unusable here. We download the whole
  file once (gzip is transparent for a full GET). SQLite runs in a **Web Worker**
  (`src/db-worker.js`); `src/db.js` is a thin message client. The worker is
  required for the durable **OPFS** cache: the SAHPool VFS's
  `FileSystemSyncAccessHandle` is **Worker-only** (it's `undefined` on the main
  thread in Chrome), so the old main-thread SAHPool always failed and re-fetched
  the ~58 MB DB every visit. In the worker OPFS persists (no COOP/COEP needed,
  SAHPool not the Atomics VFS); falls back to an in-memory deserialize when OPFS
  is unavailable. Trade-off: query results cross the worker boundary (structured
  clone) — negligible even for the big zone queries.
- **Cache invalidation:** `build-db.mjs` writes `data/version.json` with a
  content hash. `db.js` keys the download URL (`?v=`) and the OPFS filename by
  that hash and wipes old copies, so a new deploy auto-refreshes clients.
- **Routing** is query-param based (SPA, no server rewrites): `?item=`, `?npc=`,
  `?quest=`, `?faction=`, `?zone=`, `?subzone=`, `?dungeon=`, `?dungeons`,
  `?browse=items|npcs|quests|factions|zones|subzones|crafting`, `?search=`, `?compare=a:b:c`
  (item comparison), `?talents=<class>` (talent calculator), `?random`. `route()`
  checks `?browse=` (and `?compare=`) **before** the singular entity params (browse
  URLs carry filter params like `faction=a` that collide otherwise). See `src/main.js`.
  The **dataset** (main vs dev DB) is orthogonal to `route()` — it's chosen from the
  path (`/dev/…`) in `src/config.js`, not a `route()` branch (see "Two datasets").
- **Item browse gear features** (`src/browse.js`): the multi-criteria stat filter
  (`stats=key,op,val|…`, `match=all|any` for AND/OR) and **stat-weight ranking**
  (`weights=key:w|…` + `STAT_WEIGHT_PRESETS`) add a computed, sortable **Score**
  column — both resolve stats through the derived `item_stats` table. Selecting rows
  → **Compare** builds a `?compare=` URL; a localStorage compare tray (main.js
  `renderCompareTray`) collects items across pages. The selection bar itself is
  `src/selbar.js`, shared with the search results' Items tab.
- **Zone maps use Leaflet + a Pixi GPU overlay** (`L.CRS.Simple`,
  `leaflet-pixi-overlay` + `pixi.js`, all npm, lazy-loaded as one chunk via
  `src/zonemap.js`). A zone page renders the in-game parchment image
  (`public/maps/<areaId>.webp`) and plots spawn markers; world (x,y) → image px
  via the zone's WorldMapArea bounds (`lat=H*(x-locbottom)/(loctop-locbottom)`,
  `lng=W*(locleft-y)/(locleft-locright)`). Markers are **Pixi sprites** in one
  `PIXI.Container` (a tinted disc texture for category dots, atlas/CDN textures
  for focus/object icons) so huge zones (~12k spawns) pan/zoom on the GPU.
  Category toggles are tiny `L.Layer`s flipping `sprite.visible`; hover tooltip +
  click-nav use a throttled nearest-visible-sprite hit-test (no per-marker DOM).
  The previous overlay is `destroy()`ed on re-init to free its WebGL context.
- **Search is unified + FTS-backed.** `?search=` renders a tabbed page across
  items/NPCs/quests/dungeons/zones/subzones; the top-bar input also shows a live flat
  top-5 dropdown (`src/search.js`, `runSearch()` + `initSearchDropdown()`). Items,
  creatures, quests, and spells have FTS5 tables (`*_fts`, `unicode61`, prefix);
  dungeons (maps), zones and subzones use LIKE over their small tables. The Items tab
  carries the full `src/selbar.js` selection ops (same as `?browse=items`), and the
  Spells tab shows `spells.rank` — the client's subtext, which is usually "Rank N" but
  also "Passive" / "Toy" / "Game Master", so the column sorts on the parsed number and
  files the non-numeric labels last. Each searchable
  entity also has a **contentless `trigram` index on its name** (`*_tg`) so search
  matches **substrings/infix** ("fang" -> "Shadowfang"); the query OR-matches the
  prefix index (covers <3-char + ranking) and the trigram index. `search.js` builds
  both MATCH strings (`ftsQuery` prefix, `trigramQuery` quoted ≥3-char substrings
  AND-combined, with a no-match sentinel for short terms). The trigram indexes add
  ~2 MB to the brotli download — worth it for items/creatures (the bulk; trimming
  spells/quests saves only ~0.6 MB).
- **DB build runs `ANALYZE`** (sqlite_stat1) before the final VACUUM so the planner
  has stats for the heavy joins. The DB-worker opens read-only with tuned pragmas
  (`cache_size=-32768` 32 MB, `temp_store=MEMORY`, `query_only=ON`). `page_size`
  stays 4096 — measured optimal for the brotli download (8k/16k/32k compress worse).

## Commands

Runs on **Bun** (preferred — native `bun:sqlite`, no native compile) or **Node**
(`better-sqlite3`, an optional dep). `scripts/lib/sqlite.mjs` auto-detects.

```

`SQL_DIR` defaults to `../tortoise-wow/sql/base`; `UPDATES_DIR` defaults to its
sibling `../database_updates` (the world migrations). Built data (`*.sqlite`,
`version.json`) is **gitignored and rebuilt in CI** — never commit it.

### World migrations (sql/database_updates)

The server ships patch content (new zones, NPCs, objects, quests) as timestamped
migration files in `sql/database_updates`, applied by `mangosd` **on top of**
`sql/base` at runtime — the base dump alone is missing all of it (e.g. the 1.18.1
zones Balor/Dragonmaw/etc. would be empty). `build-db.mjs` replicates the server:
it **stages** the raw world tables it consumes from `sql/base`, then **applies the
migrations in filename (timestamp) order** before deriving the viewer tables. So
future upstream updates flow through automatically — no code change needed. The
applier (`scripts/lib/staging.mjs` + `scripts/lib/mysqlexec.mjs`) is a *targeted*
MySQL→SQLite executor (INSERT/REPLACE/UPDATE/DELETE/DROP for single-table DML; it
re-escapes string literals and skips statements for tables the build doesn't
stage), **not** a general SQL engine. CI sparse-checks out both `sql/base` **and**
`sql/database_updates` (see `deploy.yml`); a missing updates dir falls back to
base-only.

### Peer baselines ("vs. typical …")

A raw stat means nothing alone, so a stat is shown next to the **median of a
comparable cohort** plus its rank in it. Two cohorts exist; `src/context.js` renders
both (ratio bar + the outlier headline).

- **NPCs** — cohort = every non-hidden creature of the same `level_max` + `rank`,
  computed at runtime (`Q_NPC_PEERS`, index `idx_creatures_peer`). Params `?3..?6`
  pass the creature's own health/armor/DPS/AP back in so the query also returns its
  competition rank, which drives the headline ("More melee DPS than 98% of level 54
  mobs — ×3.0 the median", NPC 9176).
- **Items** — cohort = same class/subclass/slot/quality/ilvl band. No index can group
  that at runtime, so `scripts/lib/itempeers.mjs` precomputes it into `item_peer`
  (one row per gear item: its armor/DPS/base-stats + rank) and `item_peer_cohort`
  (label, member counts, medians); the page does one PK lookup (`Q_ITEM_PEERS`).
  The key **coarsens** through `COHORT_LEVELS` until a cohort clears `PEER_MIN` (10) —
  widening the ilvl band first and giving up quality last, since "vs. typical Epic
  ilvl 60–79 Dagger" beats a band that mixes greens in. ~99% of gear lands on the top
  two levels. A cohort's members are ALL items sharing its key (not just the ones that
  fell through to it), dev artifacts (`item_sources` `unobtainable`) and hidden rows
  excluded. Weapon DPS sums **both** damage lines, matching the tooltip's own
  "(53.9 damage per second)". "Base stats" = the five 1.12 primaries only —
  deliberately not a score (that's the browse stat-weight ranking's job).

- **Zones** — the profile strip above the map (`zoneStatsCard`): spawn/NPC/quest/
  gather counts, the p10–p90 **level spread** (spawn-weighted, so it reads as "what
  you meet here"; min–max would let one stray level-60 rare make a starting zone say
  "1–60"), elite share, rares/world bosses — plus the continent rank ("13th busiest ·
  3rd by quest count of 30 Kalimdor zones"), which a page that loads only its own zone
  can't know. Derived into `zone_stats` (`Q_ZONE_STATS`, one PK lookup). Ranks are per
  `mapid` over zones that have spawns. Only the **high** side gets a headline (a small
  zone being small is not trivia), and a zone with no spawns of its own gets no card:
  a city's NPCs are attributed to its parent zone (Ironforge → Dun Morogh) and an
  instance-entrance WorldMap area holds only quests, so both would otherwise be ranked
  against real zones on a quest count alone. Instance pages skip the strip entirely.

Medians, never means, on both sides: a few outliers (a raid boss's `dmg_multiplier`,
one absurd test weapon) drag a mean far off the thing players compare against.

### Subzones (`?subzone=`)

Sub-areas of a zone — Elwynn Forest → Goldshire / Northshire Valley / Fargodeep Mine.
The hierarchy always shipped (`areas.zone_id`), and `build-db`'s `homeZone()` always
computed each spawn's exact leaf area — it just **threw the leaf away** and returned
only the walked-up render zone. Keeping it (`spawn_points.sub`) is what the whole
feature rests on.

- **`sub` is set only on the clean ADT path.** The cross-map guard (an instance ADT
  tagged with a continent area id), the multi-floor reject and the WMA-box fallback
  all store `NULL` — a rejected leaf is actively wrong, and would file Hateforge
  Quarry's bosses under a Redridge sub-area. 152k of 164k spawns (93%) get one.
- **Invariant every subzone read depends on:** when `sub` is non-null,
  `zone == renderZone(sub)` *and* the point is inside that zone's own WMA box. So all
  subzone queries are **zone-scoped** (`WHERE s.zone = ?2 AND s.sub = ?1`) and ride
  the existing `idx_spawn_zone`. **There is deliberately no `idx_spawn_sub`**: it
  would cost ~2.5 MB on the cold whole-DB download and buy nothing (measured
  `Q_SUBZONE_SPAWNS` 0.95 ms, `Q_SUBZONE_LOOT` 0.94 ms vs `Q_ZONE_LOOT`'s 16 ms).
  Nothing needs "all spawns of subzone X regardless of zone".
- **`subzones`** (derived, ~1057 rows / 67 zones) carries name, the **render** zone
  (not raw `areas.zone_id` — that's the parchment the page draws, and it collapses the
  few areas whose parent is itself a sub-area), the ADT bbox, and precomputed
  spawn/npc/object/quest counts, so search, browse, the zone tab and the map dropdown
  never scan `spawn_points`. Rows with no content and the client's `*UNUSED*` leftovers
  are dropped. `quests` counts come straight off `quests.zone`, which was **already** a
  leaf area id.
- **Names repeat** ("The Great Sea" ×2 with spawns, "Southfury River", …), so every
  subzone reference — search rows, browse, the page header — carries its parent zone.
- **UI**: `?subzone=` mirrors the zone page (NPCs / Farming / Quests / Items / Objects)
  drawing the **parent's** parchment with only this area's spawns, fit to and outlined
  by the bbox (`initZoneMap` `opts.bounds`). The zone page gains a Subzones tab
  (appended last, so the default pane stays NPCs) and a map dropdown that filters the
  Pixi dots **in place** via a `DotLayer` visibility predicate — re-initing the map per
  change would drop the WebGL context and silently reset category toggles, "Selected"
  rows and pan/zoom. The dropdown is suppressed in `focus` mode (a `?zone=X&gather=Y`
  view builds no category sprites at all).
- **Optional schema.** The frontend is shared by every dataset, so a deploy lands on
  DBs built before this. `db.js` `caps()` probes for the table + column once and the
  UI degrades: no Subzones tab, no dropdown, empty search tab, zone-only Location
  labels. Dispatch `deploy-dev` / `deploy-cmangos` / `deploy-tbc-cmangos` to close it.

### NPC stats + abilities

The NPC page's **Stats** tab and **Abilities** tab (wowhead-style) come from
`creature_template` columns the build used to drop, plus one derived table.

- **Stats** live on `creatures`: `armor`, `mana_min/max`, `dmg_min/max`,
  `dmg_school`, `attack_power`, `base_attack_time`, the ranged trio, `unit_class`,
  the six `*_res`, `gold_min/max`, `mechanic_immune_mask`, `school_immune_mask`.
  `dmg_multiplier` is **folded into `dmg_min/max` and dropped** — the server applies
  it when it builds the creature (`Creature::SelectLevel` → `SetBaseWeaponDamage`),
  so the stored numbers are what the mob actually hits for. Like `health_*`, they're
  pre-`rate.*`-config values (the world data doesn't expose those rates).
- The Stats tab is a **grouped table** (Defense / Offense / Resources & loot) whose
  third column reads each stat against its **peers**: `Q_NPC_PEERS` takes the
  **median** health/armor/DPS/attack-power of every non-hidden creature at the same
  `level_max` + `rank` (index `idx_creatures_peer`), so "3,379 armor" becomes
  "×0.80 of a typical level 63 boss". Median, **not** average — a few raid bosses
  with a big `dmg_multiplier` drag the lvl-63-boss mean DPS to ~4990 vs a ~1277
  median. Under `NPC_PEER_MIN` (10) peers the cohort isn't representative, so every
  ratio cell renders empty and the table's `hideEmpty` drops the column outright
  rather than quoting a made-up median.
- **Abilities** land in `creature_ability(creature, spell, src, prob, cd_min,
  cd_max, ord)`, unioned from four sources; `(creature, spell)` is unique and the
  first source to claim a pair wins, in this order:
  `l` the shared spell list (`creature_template.spell_list_id` → `creature_spells`;
  carries a cast chance + repeat cooldown, stored by the server in **seconds**),
  `t` the four `spell_id1..4` template slots, `e` EventAI scripted casts
  (`creature_ai_events.action{1,2,3}_script` → `creature_ai_scripts` command 15,
  `datalong` = the spell), `a` the passive `auras` list, and `c` the ScriptDev2 **C++**
  fights (below). Rows whose spell isn't in the shipped `spells` table are dropped, so
  this runs **after** the spells import.
- **`c` -- C++ boss fights.** A boss scripted in the server's C++ has no spell list, no
  template slots and no EventAI rows, so it listed nothing at all (Ragnaros, Nefarian,
  Onyxia...). `extract-script-abilities.mjs` (LOCAL) parses
  `../tortoise-wow/src/scripts/**/*.cpp`: constants -> each AI struct's brace range ->
  the cast calls inside it, then chains `newscript->Name` -> `GetAI_*` -> struct, and
  writes the committed `scripts/data/script-abilities.json` (`script_name -> [spell]`).
  build-db joins it on `creature_template.script_name`. **Turtle only** -- cmangos'
  `ScriptName` points at its own separate C++, so attributing Turtle's spells there
  would be a guess (and cmangos covers those fights with EventAI). Shared scripts that
  cast from DB data (`generic_spell_ai`, 338 creatures) correctly resolve to zero.
- The **Skinning** tab leads with the skill a skinner needs, derived on the client from
  the creature's level (`constants.js` `skinningReq`) — no DB column. Server-exact
  (`Spell::CheckCast` SPELL_EFFECT_SKINNING: `level*5`, or `(level-10)*10` while the
  skinner is under 100 skill; the branches cross at level 20). A level *range* shows a
  range, and anything over the 300 profession cap (61+ bosses) says so and links to
  `?browse=items&stats=skinning,>=,1` — the gathering-skill bonuses (`skinning`/
  `herbalism`/`mining`, derived into `item_stats` from each item's MOD_SKILL equip
  aura) are GEAR_CRITERIA stats, so the existing stat filter lists the +Skinning gear.
- **cmangos** carries the same data in different shapes, so the derivation branches
  on the staged **column names**, not on `SQL_SOURCE`: the template slots are a
  separate `creature_template_spells` table, `creature_spell_list` is row-per-spell
  with cooldowns in **milliseconds**, `creature_ai_scripts` *is* the EventAI event
  table (action type 11 = cast) rather than dbscripts, and auras live in
  `creature_template_addon`. The adapter stages those under their own names.

### Sounds (`?voicelines`, NPC Sounds tab, zone Music tab)

Extracted game audio: what an NPC says/roars, and what a zone plays. Wowhead-style, plus
the thing wowhead doesn't have — **transcripts**, and full-text search over them.

- **Audio is R2-only** (`public/sounds/`, ~5.0k files / ~1.0 GB), like maps and minimap
  tiles. What's **committed** is `scripts/data/sound-map.json` (~0.7 MB) — the mapping CI
  can't rebuild without a client — and `scripts/data/script-sounds.json`.
- **Transcoding** (`extract-sounds.py`, needs ffmpeg): `.wav` → Opus in Ogg, music/ambience
  96k stereo and voice 48k mono. Already-compressed sources ≤512 KB are **copied through**
  (re-encoding a 19 KB Ogg measured 18 KB — generation loss for nothing, and these are the
  quality-sensitive Turtle voice clips). Above that they are re-encoded: Turtle's custom
  ambience ships as 4–11 MB mp3s. Music is 828 MB of the 1.0 GB — `MUSIC_ARGS` is the knob.
  Output paths mirror the source (lowercased, minus the leading `sound/`), which is both
  the dedupe key and stable across runs.
- **The NPC chain is entirely client-side**, hence the committed JSON:
  `creature_template.display_id` → `CreatureDisplayInfo.SoundID` (an override, ~300 rows)
  else `CreatureModelData[.ModelID].SoundID` → `CreatureSoundData` → ~20 activity slots
  (Aggro/Death/Exertion/Loop/Fidget/Custom Attack/Pet…). Separately
  `CreatureDisplayInfo.NPCSoundID` → `NPCSounds` → the greeting/farewell/pissed set.
  Zones: `AreaTable.{ZoneMusic,AmbienceID,IntroSound}` → `ZoneMusic` / `SoundAmbience` /
  `ZoneIntroMusicTable`, each a day+night pair (collapsed to one row when identical).
- **`WMOAreaTable` is a second, easily-missed source.** The client also binds audio to the
  BUILDING you stand in, and that never reaches the zone's own `AreaTable` row — the
  Deadmines' iconic `Moment-Spooky01` intro is a WMO row (wmo 499 → area 1581) with
  nothing on the AreaTable side at all. Reading zones only silently loses it. 2,889 rows
  carry music/ambience/intro across 305 areas; those with an `AreaTableID` are placeable
  and land as `… (Interior)` kinds, deduped against whatever the zone already lists (a WMO
  usually repeats the zone track). Fields 6/7/8/10 = Ambience/ZoneMusic/IntroSound/
  AreaTableID, all ahead of the localized name block, so TBC doesn't move them.
- **Transcripts come from the server, but the SPEAKER usually doesn't.** `script_texts`
  pairs a line with a sound id and says nothing about who says it — that binding is a C++
  `DoScriptText(SAY_AGGRO, m_creature)` call, read out by `extract-script-sounds.mjs` via
  the shared `scripts/lib/scriptdev.mjs` chain (the same enum → AI struct → `script_name`
  walk `extract-script-abilities.mjs` uses). It resolves ~half; `broadcast_text` covers a
  second pool where `creature_ai_events.creature_id` *does* name the speaker. **A line
  that can't be attributed is still listed, without a speaker** — dropping it was a bug
  that cost ~2/3 of the voice lines. Result: 420 distinct lines with audio, 176 credited.
- **`extract-script-sounds.mjs` must run BEFORE `extract-sounds.py`.** A boss line's sound
  is in neither `CreatureSoundData` nor the VA directory, so the client DBCs give the
  extractor no reason to pull it; the `ids` array in `script-sounds.json` is that reason.
  Without it 30 of ~340 voice lines had audio. Turtle's own voice acting is scoped by
  **directory** instead (`Sound\Interface\VA`, ~400 clips) — most are played straight from
  C++ and referenced by no DBC row at all.
- **`Sound\Creature\<Folder>` is the scope rule that scales, and it supersedes chasing
  boss ids one at a time.** `script-sounds.json` only ever worked for Turtle: it is parsed
  out of *Turtle's* ScriptDev2 tree, so on the cmangos rows every C++-scripted boss listed
  nothing but grunts. Mother Shahraz (22947) is the case that forced this — 11 spoken lines
  sitting in `Sound\Creature\MotherShahraz`, reachable from no DBC row at all, while wowhead
  lists them all. The folder IS the client's own "all audio for this creature" grouping, so
  it is taken whole: 3,757 sounds on a TBC client, 3,830 on Turtle, against the ~1,400
  `CreatureSoundData` reaches. New client, new boss, new core — no worklist to update.
  Binding a folder back to a creature uses three signals, and needs all three:
  1. the folder holds a sound some `CreatureSoundData` row references → that CSD's displays;
  2. the folder `CreatureModelData.ModelPath` sits in → that model's displays (`cmd_path`).
     Together these are ~313 of 568 TBC folders, and they are done in the extractor
     (`displayDir`), being purely client-side.
  3. else the folder NAME vs the creature name — exact, else contained-in with ≥6 chars and
     ≤3 matching names ("Faerlina" is "Grand Widow Faerlina"; "Archer" is in 42 names and
     means none of them). Done in **build-db**, which is where creature names live. This is
     the only thing that finds Shahraz: her display reuses another model's sound data.
  A folder that binds to nothing (generic voice types like `Peon`, cut content) is still
  extracted and still listed at `?sounds` — `Q_SOUND_LIST` files it as `Creature` on its
  file path — it just carries no NPC attribution, which beats a guessed one.
  These rows carry `creature_sound.ord` **200 (speech) / 201 (noise)** — above every client
  slot, whose max is 103 — which is how `main.js` groups them without a new column an older
  DB would fail on. A folder holds both kinds: Illidan's 19 spoken lines sit beside his wing
  flaps. The splitter is the **`A_` filename prefix**, Blizzard's own marker for a spoken
  SoundEntries row and near-perfect here (of 1,773 `A_` rows in TBC creature folders, the
  only effect-*looking* names are `…Summon01` — the boss saying "arise"), plus a small
  vocal-activity set for the rest.
  Their **activity** is read off the filename by two rules: a known activity word anywhere
  in it (longest first, so `SpecialAttack` isn't read as `Attack`), else the name minus its
  `A_` prefix, trailing counter and the FOLDER NAME (`A_Mr Smite Alarm01` in `MrSmite` →
  Alarm), compared on alphanumerics because the two spell the creature differently as often
  as not. **There is deliberately no third "last word-ish token" rule**: it reads the
  ENCOUNTER prefix as an activity — Illidan's numbered lines came out labelled "Illidan",
  the Black Temple prelude "Btprlude" — which is worse than a blank activity cell.
- **A transcript belongs to a TAKE, not to the sound.** The 10 files a SoundEntries row can
  hold are interchangeable to the *client*, not to a reader: they are different lines.
  "Time is money, friend!" is take 1 of `GoblinMaleZanyNPCGreetings`, take 4 of
  `GoblinFemaleZanyNPCGreetings` and take 6 of `GoblinFemaleZanyVendorNPCGreeti`. Keying
  `sound_text` on the sound alone made every page quote whichever row came first and cue
  take 1's audio, so a phrase search found the right sounds and then printed and played
  something else. Hence `sound_text.take` — NULL where no take is knowable, which is
  exactly the server-derived pool (`script_texts` / `broadcast_text` pair a line with a
  SOUND and say nothing about which file carries it). The take was never missing from the
  inputs: `voice-transcripts*.json` are indexed by take and build-db already read that
  index for hand-vs-machine precedence, then dropped it on insert.
  Frontend: `caps().soundTake` gates it, the take-aware queries are **additive** (each page
  keeps its single-text column as the fallback), the transcript cell lists every take
  numbered against the player chips, clicking a line selects that take, and a search hit
  resolves WHICH take matched so the player opens on it.
- **Crediting a speaker UPDATEs, it does not INSERT a copy.** The three attribution passes
  (cluster-propagate, name-match, abbreviation) used to insert a credited duplicate of an
  anonymous line. That was invisible only because every page read one row per sound —
  listing all takes showed each line set twice, once numbered with an `auto` badge and once
  bare. They now write `creature` onto the existing rows (546 rows of pure duplication gone
  on main). `src` is deliberately left alone: it records where the TEXT came from, so a
  machine transcript stays machine-flagged whoever is later found to say it.
- **Tables**: `sounds` (id → name/type/files/ms; `files` is a JSON array, since one
  SoundEntries row holds up to 10 interchangeable takes the client picks between — the UI
  renders them as numbered chips), `creature_sound`, `zone_sound`, `sound_text` +
  `sound_text_fts`. **Optional schema** — `db.js` `caps()` probes for `sounds` and the UI
  hides itself on a DB built before this (dispatch the per-dataset deploys to close it).
- **`f.rank` must be qualified** in any query joining `sound_text_fts` to `creatures`:
  creatures has its own `rank` column (elite/rare/boss) and the bare name is ambiguous, so
  the query throws and — behind the view's `catch` — search silently returns nothing.
- Category labels are derived from the **slot**, never `SoundEntries.type`: that column is
  a playback-engine flag (2D vs 3D, looping) and says nothing about what the sound is.
- **Reachable from three places**, which is the point of a transcript index: `?voicelines`
  (More → Voice Lines), a **Voice Lines tab on `?search=`**, and the top-bar dropdown.
  `Q_SEARCH_VOICE` unions two ways in — the spoken TEXT (FTS) and the sound NAME (LIKE) —
  because "ragnaros" should find his clips by name while a quoted phrase finds them by
  what is said; the name half is the only thing that surfaces Turtle's ~400 VA clips,
  most of which no text row references. In `rankFlat` a voice row is tiered on its
  TRANSCRIPT, not its sound name: ranking a spoken line by its internal filename buries
  an exact quote under unrelated clips whose name happens to start with the term.
- Zone music also appears on **subzone** pages — a sub-area is its own `AreaTable` row and
  ~half of them (495/1057) carry their own track, so Northshire Valley plays something
  Elwynn doesn't. It counts toward that page's `hasData`, or a lake with no spawns would
  claim "nothing is recorded here" while holding something to play.
- **Per-expansion**: the archive order and every DBC offset live in
  `scripts/lib/clientprofile.py`. TBC keeps its spoken audio in the *locale* archives
  (`enGB/speech-enGB.MPQ`, `expansion-speech-enGB.MPQ`), `CreatureSoundData` grew 30 → 37
  fields (an unused `NPCSoundID` at 23 pushes Loop/Jump/Pet by one) and
  `CreatureDisplayInfo.NPCSoundID` moved 11 → 12. `SoundEntries` itself is 29 fields in
  both — it carries no localized string, so nothing in it shifted.

### Transcribing the clips nothing writes down

~1,600 voice sounds (4,067 takes) have audio and no line anywhere in the world data: the
client picks a clip from an NPC's voice type and the words exist only in the audio.
`scripts/transcribe-sounds.py` (LOCAL, GPU) runs Whisper over `public/sounds` and writes
`scripts/data/voice-transcripts-auto.json`. Doing it ourselves also sidesteps the wiki
route: a wiki lists what a voice TYPE says, not which take says it, and its text is
CC BY-SA.

- **Two files, and the precedence matters.** `voice-transcripts.json` is hand-verified and
  authoritative; `voice-transcripts-auto.json` is machine output. build-db loads hand
  first, and a hand line for a sound suppresses the machine one for that whole sound.
  Machine rows carry src `w` and the UI badges them "auto" — a guess from audio must not
  read with the same authority as a line lifted from the server's own scripts.
- **Scope is voice only.** Anything reachable from `zone_sound` is excluded: speech
  recognition over a five-minute orchestral loop yields confident nonsense and would
  dominate the runtime.
- **Whisper hallucinates in silence, and repeats itself doing it** — a 0.6s grunt becomes
  "Thanks for watching!". Hence a phrase denylist plus gates on `avg_logprob`,
  `no_speech_prob` and a 0.8s floor, and VAD on.
- The speaker's name goes in `initial_prompt`, which is what gets Anub'Rekhan and
  Vek'nilash spelled correctly; a general model has never seen them.
- **GPU**: `--compute` is **negotiated at runtime** via
  `ctranslate2.get_supported_compute_types()`, not hardcoded. A GTX 1070 (Pascal) reports
  `{int8_float32, int8, float32}` and **no fp16 at all**, so a hardcoded `int8_float16`
  fails to initialise and silently drops the whole run onto the CPU. ctranslate2 also
  needs the CUDA 12 runtime (`pip install nvidia-cublas-cu12 nvidia-cudnn-cu12`); the
  script registers those DLL dirs itself, because without them the model LOADS (VRAM
  fills, it looks like the GPU is working) and every encode then dies with
  "cublas64_12.dll is not found".
- **Checkpoints every 25 sounds.** The first full pass ran 105 minutes and persisted
  nothing — it wrote once at the end and stalled before reaching it.
- **Whisper's degenerate repetition loop** is guarded (`repetition_penalty`,
  `no_repeat_ngram_size`, `compression_ratio_threshold`): one 3-second clip stalled a run
  for ~48 minutes emitting tokens to the window cap.
- **A systemic error must abort, not be absorbed per file.** 5 consecutive identical
  failures stop the run — otherwise a missing CUDA DLL reads as 4,067 bad files and the
  run reports success having transcribed nothing.
- Thresholds are measured, not guessed: real lines score `avg_logprob` −0.21…−0.44 and
  grunts −0.79…−1.14, while DURATION is a poor discriminator ("Yo" is 0.40s), which is why
  the length floor is only 0.25s.

### Browsing sounds (`?sounds`)

2,545 sounds exist; `?voicelines` only ever listed the ~1,000 with words, so music,
ambience and creature audio had no page at all. `?sounds` lists everything, filterable by
name **or file path** (people know these by either), with a derived **Kind** — Music /
Ambience / Zone Intro / Voice Acting / NPC Gossip / Creature. Kind comes from what POINTS
at a sound, never `SoundEntries.type`, which is a playback flag (2D/3D/looping).

- **The player column needs `max-width`, not `width`.** `width: 1px` is the usual
  shrink-to-content idiom and it does nothing in these tables: measured against the real
  page, `width` of 1px / 1% / 100% all left the column at 344px around a 211px control,
  because auto layout hands the slack back. Only `max-width` binds. `.snd` wraps its take
  chips so a 10-take sound doesn't overflow the cap.

### NPC gossip (`npc_gossip`, the NPC Gossip tab, the search Dialogue tab)

What an NPC says when you *talk* to it, and the only place a quoted phrase is searchable.

- **A voice clip and a spoken line are different objects, and the data never links them.**
  The client picks the clip from the NPC's **voice type** (`GoblinMaleGruffVendorNPCGreeting`
  is shared by ~50 goblin male gruff vendors) and shows that one NPC's gossip text
  separately. Only 94 of 13,665 `broadcast_text` rows carry a `sound_id` at all, and **no**
  gossip-slot sound has one — so "Time is money, friend" can never be a *transcript* of the
  vendor greeting, however much it sounds like one. It is gossip text, and it belongs to
  Clemence the Counter.
- Chain: `creature_template.gossip_menu_id` → `gossip_menu.text_id` → `npc_text.BroadcastTextID0..7`
  → `broadcast_text.male_text`. Yields ~4,983 lines across ~2,620 NPCs.
- `npc_gossip` is deliberately **not** `WITHOUT ROWID`: `npc_gossip_fts` is external-content
  and keys on the content table's rowid, which such a table doesn't have.
- Rendered through `questText()`, since gossip carries the same `$B`/`$N` tokens quest text
  does. **Optional schema** — `caps().gossip` gates the tab and the search query.

### Custom icons

Turtle adds items whose icons are **not on Blizzard's CDN**; they live only in
the client patch MPQs as BLP textures, and their `display_id → icon` mapping is
in the client `ItemDisplayInfo.dbc`, **absent from the server SQL dump**. CI has
no client, so the extracted icons + the mapping supplement are **committed
source** (the one exception to "don't commit built data" — they can't be
regenerated in CI). `extract-icons.py` runs locally (needs the client +
`StormLib.dll`); `build-atlas.py` repacks the committed icons into the shipped
atlas and needs only the repo. Re-run both when the client updates with new
items, then commit. Set `TW_CLIENT` / `STORMLIB` / `SQL_DIR` to relocate inputs.

**Run order: `build-db` BEFORE `extract-icons`.** Item display_ids shift with the
world migrations, so `extract-icons.py` reads the migrated display_ids from the
built `public/data/tortoise.sqlite` (falls back to `sql/base` with a warning if
absent) — otherwise migration-added items' icons are never extracted. It also
recovers icons present in the client but absent from a patch MPQ's listfile via a
direct `SFileHasFile` probe (plain enumeration misses them). Full local refresh:
`build-db` → `extract-icons` → `extract-spell-icons` → `build-atlas` → `build-db`
(to merge the updated supplement + spell-icon map).

**Spell icons** work the same way but the mapping source is the client
`SpellIcon.dbc` (the server `spell_template` dump stores only a numeric
`spellIconId`). `extract-spell-icons.py` reads the used `spellIconId`s from the
built DB, resolves each to its texture basename, and writes
`scripts/data/spell-icon-map.json` (`spellIconId → basename`, committed). Spells
share the `Interface\Icons` pool with items, so standard basenames load straight
from the CDN; only Turtle-custom spell icons (not on the CDN) are extracted into
the shared `assets/icons/custom/` atlas pool. `build-db.mjs` joins the map onto
`spells.icon`; absent map ⇒ text/CDN-fallback spell links (graceful).

### Seamless world map (?worldmap=)

A continuous, zoomable continent minimap (Eastern Kingdoms map 0, Kalimdor map 1)
— wowhead/gamermaps-style — alongside the per-zone parchments. `extract-minimap.py`
(LOCAL) stitches the client's per-ADT-block minimap BLPs (md5-renamed; resolved via
`textures\Minimap\md5translate.trs`) into a Leaflet XYZ tile **pyramid**
(`public/minimap/<mapId>/{z}/{x}/{y}.webp`, z0..6, 256px, y-down) and writes the
tiny transform manifest `scripts/data/minimap.json`. The ADT grid is regular, so
world→pixel is **linear + uniform** (no per-zone WorldMapArea bounds):
`gpx = tile*(32 - worldY/adt)`, `gpy = tile*(32 - worldX/adt)` (tile=256,
adt=1600/3); one CRS unit = native px / 2^maxNativeZoom. `src/zonemap.js`
`initWorldMap()` draws the pyramid (CRS.Simple, y-down `Transformation(1,0,1,0)`)
and reprojects every spawn with that formula, reusing the zone map's Pixi dot
overlay + category toggles. `src/main.js` `showWorldMap()` (route `?worldmap=<map>`)
loads the bundled manifest, queries `Q_WORLD_SPAWNS`/`Q_WORLD_OBJECTS` (generous
LIMITs — a continent has ~67k spawns; categories default OFF so the cost is paid
only on toggle), and serves tiles from `${ASSETS_BASE}minimap/`.

Only overworld continents WITH spawns ship (the `SHIP` map in the script): Outland
/ Kalidar exist as client art but have no spawns → excluded. Scope = maps 0,1.

**The tile pyramid is NOT committed** — it lives only on R2 (see "Binary assets live
on R2"), like `public/maps`. Only the tiny `scripts/data/minimap.json` transform
manifest is committed (Vite bundles it). Re-run `extract-minimap.py` on client map
changes, then `bun scripts/publish-assets.mjs` to push the new tiles.

## File map

- `scripts/build-db.mjs` — the whole build. **Stages** the raw world tables from
  `sql/base` and **applies the `sql/database_updates` migrations** on top (see
  "World migrations"), then reads from the staged tables to: **resolve effective
  drop chances** into a `drops` table (mangos loot groups + references) and
  **drop the raw loot tables**; build `maps`/`spawns` (location), the `quests`
  table + `quest_item`/`quest_creature_objective`/`quest_reward_rep` links +
  `areas`/`faction_names` lookups, the `creature_rep` table (rep-per-kill, flattened
  from `creature_onkill_reputation` — powers the faction rep-grind calculator), the
  derived `factions` summary (rep-gated item + rep-quest + rep-mob counts per
  faction), `spell_creates`/`spell_reagent` link tables, the
  `spells` table (incl. `icon` from `spell-icon-map.json`, `skill` profession, and
  detailed combat columns resolved via `spell-lookups.json`), the spell teach
  sources (`spell_trainer` NPCs + `spell_taught_item` books, plus `spells.learnable`),
  the `creature_ability` table (the spells an NPC casts — see "NPC stats + abilities"),
  an `item_display_info` icon map, the `*_fts` search indexes (items/creatures/
  quests/spells), and `version.json`. Staging tables are dropped before the final VACUUM.
- `scripts/lib/staging.mjs` — stages the consumed raw tables (`stg_<table>`),
  bulk-loads base rows, then applies the migrations in timestamp order; exposes
  positional `rows()`/`columns()` accessors the importers read instead of dump text.
- `scripts/lib/mysqlexec.mjs` — the MySQL→SQLite statement splitter + translator
  staging uses (string re-escaping, `INSERT IGNORE`/`ON DUPLICATE` rewrites,
  table retargeting to `stg_*`). Targeted at the migrations' single-table DML.
- `scripts/extract-icons.py` — LOCAL: pulls Turtle custom BLP icons from the
  client MPQs (StormLib) → `assets/icons/custom/*.webp`, plus `scripts/data/
  item-display-supplement.json` (the `display_id → icon` corrective rows build-db
  merges — every item row the server SQL dump is missing or has stale vs the DBC).
- `scripts/extract-spell-icons.py` — LOCAL: reads the used `spellIconId`s from the
  built DB, resolves each via the client `SpellIcon.dbc` → `scripts/data/
  spell-icon-map.json` (`spellIconId → icon basename`, committed; build-db joins it
  onto `spells.icon`), and extracts any Turtle-custom spell icons (not on the CDN)
  into the shared `assets/icons/custom/` pool. Also dumps the four index→value
  lookup DBCs (`SpellCastTimes/SpellRange/SpellDuration/SpellRadius`) → committed
  `scripts/data/spell-lookups.json`, which build-db uses to resolve the detailed
  spell page's cast time / range / duration / radius.
- `scripts/build-atlas.py` — packs `assets/icons/custom/*.webp` into the shipped
  sprite sheet `public/icons/custom-atlas.{webp,json}`.
- `scripts/extract-maps.py` — LOCAL: parses the client `WorldMapArea.dbc`, stitches
  the base `Interface\WorldMap\<dir>` BLP tiles AND composites the explored-detail
  `WorldMapOverlay` textures, then crops to the 1002×668 content (drops the black
  tile padding; keeps the authentic burnt frame, like wowhead) → committed
  `public/maps/<areaId>.webp` + `scripts/data/zones.json` (zone bounds + dims; image
  dims MUST equal the world-bound rectangle or Leaflet markers misalign).
  `spawn_points`/`zones` tables are built in CI from these + the SQL dumps (which
  carry spawn coords). Each spawn's zone is the ADT-exact `spawn_points.zone` (see
  `extract-area-bounds.py` + the "Zone assignment" gotcha), not the loose WMA box.
  Several WMAs share one areaId — an instance interior (mapId = the instance) plus a
  continent "entrance" mini-map; the parchment output is areaId-keyed, so extract-maps
  **prefers the instance interior** (e.g. Dire Maul 2557 → the `DireMaul` interior on
  map 429, not `DireMaulEntrance`). The map-less instances (no WorldMap at all) fall
  back to a tab-only page.
- `scripts/extract-area-bounds.py` — LOCAL: reads the client ADTs (per `Map.dbc`
  continent dir; MCNK terrain chunks carry the real AreaTable id) and accumulates the
  world-coord bounding box per area → committed `scripts/data/subzone-bounds.json`
  (`{mapId: [{i:areaId, x0,x1,y0,y1}]}`). build-db assigns each spawn the smallest
  box containing it, keeping BOTH the leaf area (`spawn_points.sub`, see "Subzones")
  and that leaf walked up `area_template.zone_id` to the render zone (`.zone`) — exact
  coord→zone the SQL dumps lack. Re-run on client updates. **Per-expansion**: resolved
  through `clientData()`, so `CLIENT_PROFILE=tbc` + `AREA_BOUNDS_OUT=…-tbc.json` against
  a TBC 2.4.3 client yields `subzone-bounds-tbc.json` — the only source of Outland
  (map 530 `Expansion01`) bounds, and of the TBC-era maps 0/1 that carry Eversong /
  Ghostlands / Azuremyst / Bloodmyst. ADT format is unchanged from 1.12 (MCNK areaid
  at header `+0x34`; split `_obj0`/`_tex0` ADTs only arrive in Cataclysm), so only the
  MPQ set differs.
- `scripts/extract-minimap.py` — LOCAL: stitches the client's per-ADT-block minimap
  BLPs into the seamless-world-map tile pyramid `public/minimap/<mapId>/{z}/{x}/{y}.webp`
  (committed — CI can't rebuild it; synced to R2 by deploy.yml) + the committed
  transform manifest `scripts/data/minimap.json`. See "Seamless world map (?worldmap=)".
  Per-map runs MERGE the manifest. Standalone reference C# tooling:
  `X:\Programming\WoWTools.Minimaps` (not used by the build).
- `scripts/extract-talents.py` — LOCAL: reads the client `Talent.dbc` +
  `TalentTab.dbc` → committed `scripts/data/talents.json` (talent-tree STRUCTURE:
  per class → tab → talent row/col/rank-spell-ids/prereq). Names/icons/tooltips are
  NOT stored — `src/talents.js` resolves them from the rank spell ids against the
  shipped `spells` table. CI has no client, so the JSON is committed source (real
  all-class data, 9 classes / 476 talents, extracted from the Turtle client). DBC
  offsets are verified in the script header; re-run + commit on client changes. See
  the talent calculator route `?talents=<class>`.
- `scripts/build-tooltips.mjs` — dumps compact per-entity JSON
  (`dist/tt/<prefix>/<id>.json`, prefixes i/n/q/s) for the embeddable powered-tooltip
  widget `public/embed/tw-power.js`. Content-hashed like the OG stubs (HASH_ONLY=1);
  run AFTER `vite build` (it writes into `dist`, which vite wipes). deploy.yml
  regenerates + merges it (cache-gated). `public/embed/demo.html` is a demo/test page.
- `scripts/build-api.mjs` — the **public JSON API** (Wowhead-style): one rich file per
  entity at `dist/api/<i|n|q|s>/<id>.json` — the same data the detail page shows
  (structured fields + stats + capped source lists + a rendered `tooltipHtml`), served
  from R2 at **`api.tortoiseclothing.org`** (`/i/55057`, or `.json`). REUSES the app's
  real SQL (`src/queries.js`) + tooltip renderer (`src/render.js` `renderTooltip`/
  `spellTooltip` — both pure/Node-safe) so it can't drift from the page; tooltip links
  are absolutized to the site. Source arrays capped to 25 (best-first) to bound size.
  Content-hashed (`HASH_ONLY=1`) + `api/manifest.json` like the tt JSON; deploy.yml
  builds it cache-gated and R2-syncs it hash-gated (R2-only, never in `dist`). Env:
  `OUT_DIR`, `DB_PATH`, `API_ONLY` (i,n,q,s), `API_LIMIT`, `API_VERSION` (bump on schema
  change). Serving needs a one-time Cloudflare setup: add `api.tortoiseclothing.org`
  as an R2 custom domain on the `tortoise-db-viewer` bucket, set bucket CORS to `*`,
  and a Transform Rule rewriting `/[inqs]/<id>` → `…/<id>.json`.
- `scripts/extract-script-abilities.mjs` — LOCAL: reads the server ScriptDev2 C++
  (`../tortoise-wow/src/scripts/**/*.cpp`) → committed `scripts/data/script-abilities.json`
  (`script_name → [spellId]`). Per file it collects the `NAME = <number>` constants, walks
  each `struct …AI` brace range for `DoCastSpellIfCan`/`CastSpell`/`DoCast`/`DoCastAOE`
  calls, resolves their spell argument through those constants, then chains
  `newscript->Name` → `GetAI_*` → struct so a multi-script file attributes correctly (a
  file with a single AI struct falls back to it). build-db joins it on
  `creature_template.script_name` → `creature_ability` src `c`. CI has no server `src/`,
  so the JSON is committed; re-run + commit on scriptdev changes.
- `scripts/extract-instance-bosses.mjs` — LOCAL: reads the server ScriptDev2 C++
  (`../tortoise-wow/src/scripts/dungeons/<instance>/`) + the built DB → committed
  `scripts/data/instance-bosses.json` (`[{e:creatureEntry, m:mapId}]`). Instance bosses
  placed by C++ scripts have NO static `creature` spawn, so the SQL dump can't locate
  them; this parses each folder's creature/GO enums, grounds the folder→mapId from the
  built DB (gameobjects are placed inside the instance), and maps every spawn-less
  creature there to that map. build-db loads it into `creature_instance`; the character
  upgrade finder (`qInstanceDropsIn`) uses it to name e.g. "Razorfen Downs · Tuten'kash".
  CI has no server `src/`, so the JSON is committed. Run: build-db → this → build-db.
- `scripts/extract-vanilla-ids.mjs` — LOCAL: reads the cmangos **Classic DB, published
  as SQLite** (github.com/cmangos/classic-db/releases → `classicmangos.sqlite`) →
  committed `scripts/data/vanilla-ids.json` (`{items,creatures,quests}` = the canonical
  vanilla-1.12 id sets, **plus** an `edited` set — see next). build-db flags Turtle-custom
  content as `custom = entry NOT IN vanilla OR entry IN edited` — more accurate than the
  old ID threshold (catches Turtle additions squatting inside the vanilla id range; not
  fooled by high-id vanilla rows). Threshold is the fallback if the JSON is absent.
  **`edited` closes the in-place-edit gap** the id-list can't see: if the built Turtle DB
  (`public/data/tortoise.sqlite`) is present, the script field-DIFFs every shared id vs
  cmangos and records Turtle's changes — **items** on a normalized-name OR curated
  gameplay-field diff (repurposed ids AND rebalances; e.g. Atiesh's tweaked weapon speed),
  **creatures/quests** on a name/title diff only (repurposes; their field diffs are FP-prone
  — derived health, NULL-vs-empty subname, npc-flag drift, quest typo-fixes — so excluded).
  Only Turtle builds union `edited` (the cmangos dataset's rows ARE that baseline). Run
  order for a full refresh: `build-db → extract-vanilla-ids → build-db` (first build makes
  the DB it diffs; `TW_DB` overrides its path). Re-run + commit on a new cmangos Classic DB
  release or material Turtle world-data change.
- `scripts/probe-wowhead-thumbs.mjs` — LOCAL: HTTP-probes Wowhead's Classic creature
  webthumb (`wow.zamimg.com/.../webthumbs/npc/<d%256>/<d>.webp`) for every creature
  `display_id`; the confirmed-404 set (Turtle-custom models Wowhead never saw) →
  committed `scripts/data/model-thumb-missing.json` (the render worklist). Full
  present/missing map cached to `model-thumb-coverage.json` (gitignored). ~1500 of
  ~8900 display_ids are custom.
- `scripts/render-model-thumbs.py` — LOCAL: renders the missing worklist to static
  preview thumbnails Wowhead can't provide. Reads the client MPQ (StormLib),
  resolves `display_id → CreatureModelData M2 (vanilla v256) + CreatureDisplayInfo
  skins`, parses the M2 (vertices/skin/views/textures/materials, bone-skinned to the
  Stand-animation frame 0), and renders headless with moderngl → `public/model-thumbs/
  <displayId>.webp` (300×300 transparent) + `manifest.json`. Two-pass opaque→additive
  blend (particle/glow planes), opaque-body framing. **CHARACTER models** (humanoid
  NPCs, `CreatureDisplayInfo.ExtendedDisplayInfoID != 0`) render from their **pre-baked
  NPC texture** (`CreatureDisplayInfoExtra` field 18 → `Textures\BakedNpcTextures\<name>`;
  Turtle ships these) mapped onto the character-skin (type 1) + object-skin (type 2)
  texture units — no full char-compositing pipeline needed; 3D hair (type 6) is skipped
  (the baked head carries the face/hairline). A char model with no bake is skipped.
  `src/render.js` `modelThumbUrl`
  serves our webp for manifest ids, else the Wowhead webthumb. Committed (CI has no
  client/GPU); re-run + commit on client model changes. Verified against wow.export's
  `M2LegacyLoader`.
- `scripts/lib/cmangos-adapter.mjs` — alternative staging source for `SQL_SOURCE=cmangos`:
  builds the viewer DB from cmangos's published Classic **SQLite** DB
  (`classicmangos.sqlite`) instead of Turtle's MySQL dumps. Returns the same accessor
  shape as `staging.mjs` so build-db's importers run unchanged — ATTACHes the cmangos DB
  and stages each table under the *Turtle* column names (same MaNGOS table names + SQLite
  case-insensitive columns ⇒ most map free; ~40 explicit renames + NULL for absent). The
  first build step of the `/{expansion}/{core}` matrix's vanilla row (see the plan in
  `notes/`). cmangos omits DBC-derived tables (it reads DBCs from the client at runtime);
  those are filled from `scripts/data/cmangos-dbc.json` (see `extract-cmangos-dbc.py`).
  `spell_template` is deferred (its text lives in Spell.dbc) ⇒ spells empty for now.
- `scripts/extract-cmangos-dbc.py` — LOCAL: reads a vanilla 1.12 client's DBCs (StormLib
  MPQ reader + WDBC parser, shared with extract-talents.py) → committed
  `scripts/data/cmangos-dbc.json` (`areas`/`maps`/`faction`/`faction_template`/
  `item_display_info`/`skill_line_ability`). Fills the DBC tables cmangos's world DB omits
  so the `SQL_SOURCE=cmangos` build gets zone names, dungeon names, faction data + NPC team
  alignment, and item icons. CI has no client ⇒ committed. `CLIENT` env overrides the path.
- `scripts/lib/itempeers.mjs` — derives the `item_peer` / `item_peer_cohort` tables
  (the item page's "vs. typical …" card): cohort key + coarsening fallback, per-cohort
  medians and competition ranks. Pure; imports only `src/constants.js` for the labels.
  See "Peer baselines".
- `scripts/extract-sounds.py` — LOCAL: pulls the client's audio (StormLib) and transcodes
  it → `public/sounds/**.ogg` (R2-only) + committed `scripts/data/sound-map.json`
  (SoundEntries → files, the CreatureSoundData/NPCSounds slot sets, display→sound-set, the
  per-area music/ambience/intro, and `dirSound`/`displayDir` — the `Sound\Creature\<Folder>`
  grouping that carries every C++-scripted boss line, plus the display ids it could bind
  client-side). See "Sounds".
- `scripts/extract-script-sounds.mjs` — LOCAL: server ScriptDev2 C++ + the `script_texts` /
  `broadcast_text` dumps → committed `scripts/data/script-sounds.json`: `script_name →
  {t: [textEntry], s: [soundId]}` (who says which line) plus `ids` (the sound worklist
  `extract-sounds.py` can't derive from the client). Run it BEFORE `extract-sounds.py`.
- `scripts/lib/scriptdev.mjs` — the shared ScriptDev2 walk (comment strip, constants, brace
  ranges, `newscript->Name` → `GetAI_*` → AI struct). `extract-script-abilities.mjs` and
  `extract-script-sounds.mjs` each supply only a `collect()` for the calls they care about.
- `src/audio.js` — the one `<audio>` for the whole app plus `soundPlayer()` / `wireAudio()`
  / `stopAudio()`. Single element on purpose (two clips at once is never intended), and
  `route()` stops it so a zone track can't outlive its page. The progress bar is a real
  `role="slider"`: pointer drag (captured, `touch-action:none`) plus arrows/Home/End.
  Seeking an idle player STARTS it — clicking into the middle of a clip is a play command.
  Two traps it handles: seeking before load can't set `currentTime`, so the fraction is
  held in `pendingSeek` and applied on `loadedmetadata`; and `play()` rejecting with
  **NotAllowedError is the autoplay policy, not a broken file** — flagging it as an error
  put a "!" on perfectly good clips. Download fetches to a **Blob**, because browsers
  ignore `<a download>` on a cross-origin URL without `Content-Disposition` — the plain
  link would open a tab instead of saving (bucket CORS is `*`; falls back to a tab).
- `scripts/lib/sqldump.mjs` — zero-dep mysqldump parser.
- `scripts/lib/schema.mjs` — generic import specs (which dump cols → which table).
- `scripts/lib/sqlite.mjs` — Bun/Node SQLite wrapper.
- `src/db.js` — thin client to the DB worker (`query()`/`queryOne()` post
  messages; resolves by id). `src/db-worker.js` — owns sqlite-wasm, installs the
  OPFS SAHPool VFS (Worker-only API), imports/opens the versioned DB, runs exec.
- `src/queries.js` — all SQL (positional `?1`). Loot reads come from `drops`.
- `src/table.js` — the one reusable table: client-side sort + paginate + group
  (collapsible) used everywhere. `createTable(container, {columns, rows, ...})`.
- `src/browse.js` — filter UI + the item/NPC/quest finder; feeds `createTable`.
- `src/selbar.js` — the item selection-ops bar (`0 selected` · Copy IDs · `.additem `
  prefix copy · Compare · Open on Wowhead · Clear), driven by `createTable`'s opt-in
  row selection. Mounted by **both** `?browse=items` and the search results' Items tab,
  which is why it's its own module — the two would otherwise drift the moment one grew
  an op. `selbarHtml()` / `updateSelbar(bar, count)` / `wireSelbar(bar, api, navigate)`;
  ops read the live selection from the table API per click, so sorting or paging between
  selecting and copying can't hand back stale rows. Search wires it via `regTable`'s
  `tableId` + the Map returned by `mountTables()`.
- `src/search.js` — unified search: `runSearch()` (shared multi-entity query,
  used by the results page) + `initSearchDropdown()` (live flat top-5 panel).
- `src/zonemap.js` — Leaflet zone map (lazy chunk): `initZoneMap()` draws the
  parchment + per-category circle-marker layers (quest/vendor/repair/trainer/
  flight/inn/bank/mob/object) with a layer-control toggle.
- `src/render.js` — `renderTooltip`, `tabs`, `itemLink`/`npcLink`/`dungeonLink`/
  `questLink`/`factionLink`, `iconImg`, `moneyHtml`, helpers. Factions are linked
  wherever named (quest reward rep, item tooltip reputation requirement).
- `src/hovercard.js` — item + quest tooltip on hover.
- `src/context.js` — comparative context ("is this number big?"): the ratio-to-median
  bar cell (`ratioCell`, `positive: true` flips the colour for more-is-better stats),
  `pctBeaten`, and `outlierLine` — the one-line "More melee DPS than 98% of level 54
  mobs" headline, which only fires on a top/bottom-decile stat ≥15% off the median.
  Shared by the NPC Stats tab, the item page's peer card and the zone profile strip.
  See "Peer baselines".
- `src/constants.js` — WoW 1.12 enum maps (quality, class/slot/stat, creature
  type/rank, quest type/sort, etc.) + `questZoneLabel`/`classRestrictions`/
  `raceRestrictions` helpers.
- `src/talents.js` — talent calculator (`?talents=<class>`): renders the trees from
  `scripts/data/talents.json`, resolves names/icons/tooltips from rank spell ids,
  enforces the 51-point / 5-per-row / prereq rules, persists the build in the URL.
- `src/main.js` — routing + the item/NPC/quest/faction/dungeon/search views, the
  `?compare=` item-comparison view, the `?random` roll, and the compare tray.

## Conventions

- **All loot/drop chances come from the `drops` table** (`src`: c=creature,
  s=skinning, p=pickpocket, o=object, i=item-container, e=disenchant). It already
  resolves equal-chance groups and reference multipliers, so queries are simple
  joins — do **not** reintroduce recursive loot CTEs.
- Tables: define `columns` as `{ key?, label, cell(row)->html, value?(row),
  num?, cls?, group?(row) }`. `value` is the sort/group key (defaults to cell
  text); `group(row)` renders the group-header label when grouped by that column
  (defaults to the cell) — use it when the cell shows a member but the group key
  is a category (e.g. crafting Source groups by "Recipe"/"Trainer"/"Auto", not by
  each recipe's name). Pass `{groupable, group, pageSize, sort, dir, onState}` to
  `createTable`. Browse persists sort/group in the URL via `onState` +
  `replaceState`.
- Item names render via `itemLink(entry, name, quality, icon)` so they get the
  quality color, lazy icon, and hover tooltip. Icons come from the DB join
  (`item_display_info`), served from `render-us.worldofwarcraft.com/icons/56/` —
  **except** Turtle custom icons, which `render.js` `iconImg` draws as a `<span>`
  sprite from the committed atlas (`main.js` loads `custom-atlas.json` at boot;
  falls back to the CDN `<img>` until then / if absent).
- Every user-facing change should keep the smoke suite green (`bun run smoke`) and
  add a check when it introduces a new view/behavior. Tests live in per-topic modules
  under `scripts/smoke/tests/*.test.mjs` (bun test); see that dir's `CLAUDE.md` for the
  harness API (`nav`/`load`/`smoke`) and how to add one.

### The `/tbc/cmangos` row (TBC 2.4.3)

Second non-Turtle matrix row: cmangos's **TBC** world DB (`tbc-sqlite-db.zip` →
`tbcmangos.sqlite`) + a TBC 2.4.3 client. Built by the same adapter, selected with
`EXPANSION=tbc`:

```sh
SQL_SOURCE=cmangos EXPANSION=tbc CMANGOS_DB=…/tbcmangos.sqlite \
CMANGOS_DBC=scripts/data/cmangos-dbc-tbc.json \
DATA_SUBDIR=data-tbc-cmangos ZONES_FILE=scripts/data/zones-tbc-cmangos.json \
bun scripts/build-db.mjs
```

`EXPANSION` is what makes it a *version*, not just a source: it resolves the
`scripts/data/<name>-tbc.json` client lookups (`clientData()`), suppresses the
Turtle-custom flag (the vanilla id list would mark all 5.4k TBC additions custom), and
blocks the Turtle instance-interior map fallback (1.12 art would be *wrong* for a TBC
dungeon, not merely missing).

**Client extraction** — `scripts/lib/clientprofile.py` holds the per-expansion MPQ order
and DBC field offsets; `CLIENT_PROFILE=tbc` selects it. Two traps it exists to avoid:
TBC keeps the whole `DBFilesClient\` tree in the **locale** archives (`Data\enGB\…`)
while `Data\patch.MPQ` still exists, so the "no archives opened" guard passes and the run
dies later; and localized strings widened from a 9-field block to 17, shifting every
field after the first name. Offsets were derived by probing the client (locale blocks
found by their zero-padding signature, numerics checked against known values), not from
memory — only Spell (Description 138→161, ToolTip 147→178), TalentTab (ClassMask/Order
12/13→20/21), SkillLineAbility (req_train_points 12→14) and ItemSet (+8) actually moved.

**TBC-specific data shapes** the adapter handles: pooled spawns move to
`creature_spawn_entry` **and set `creature.id = 0`** (7,696 of 7,733 — left alone those
NPCs have no spawn at all), and `spell_template.School` is gone in favour of `SchoolMask`
(derived back via `DERIVE`).

**A same-named column can mean a different quantity** — the adapter's real risk, and worse
than an outright missing column because nothing is NULL to warn about. `DamageMultiplier`
is the case that bit: on Turtle it's a *factor* on `dmg_min`/`dmg_max` (`SelectLevel` seeds
the weapon damage, `UpdateDamagePhysical` multiplies), so build-db folds the two together.
On cmangos it scales `creature_template_classlevelstats.BaseDamage` and `MinMeleeDmg` is
its **alternative** source, used only when `DamageMultiplier < 0 || ArmorMultiplier < 0`
(zero rows in either the Classic or TBC DB); their `UpdateDamagePhysical` multiplies by the
runtime `m_damageMultiplier`, never by the template field. Folding them double-counts. It
stayed invisible for a year because cmangos shipped `DamageMultiplier = 1.0` for every row
until ~2026-07 — then started computing real values (1.4–2.6, max 260) and every NPC's
listed damage/DPS on both cmangos datasets inflated by that factor overnight. The adapter
now stages a literal `1.0` (a `DERIVE` entry, not a rename), leaving build-db's fold
source-agnostic. **Upstream data can change meaning without changing shape — when a
number looks off by a suspiciously clean-ish factor, diff the source column against an
older release before assuming our derivation drifted.**

**Known upstream gap:** cmangos's TBC-DB has no Outland spawns for Fel Iron / Adamantite /
Khorium — they exist only inside Coilfang/Auchindoun. Outland herbs are complete. Not a
build bug; the nodes are correctly flagged `gather='mining'` and simply have no
`gameobject` rows on map 530.

### Ratings, gems and gear scoring (TBC)

**Where a stat lives moved between expansions, and reading only one place loses most of
TBC's itemisation.** 1.12 keeps base stats/resistances/armor in `item_template` columns and
everything else (crit, hit, AP, …) in EQUIP-spell auras. TBC put the combat *ratings* back
onto the **columns** as `stat_type` 12–45. `statsFromColumns` mapped only the five 1.12
primaries, so ~4,700 TBC rating rows were silently dropped — resilience, crit, spell crit,
hit, defense, haste, expertise — and TBC gear scored nearly blind. It now folds in
`ITEM_MOD_STAT` (`COLUMN_STAT_KEY`); a vanilla item never sets those ids (measured: one
stray `Health` row across all of Turtle), so the vanilla datasets are bit-identical.
`resil`/`expertise` are new GEAR_CRITERIA keys, added **TBC-only** so a 1.12 filter
dropdown doesn't grow permanently-empty options. Armor/spell penetration stay unmapped —
no 1.12 counterpart to score against.

**The stat keys are shared but the UNITS are not**, which is why `STAT_WEIGHT_PRESETS`
forks on `EXPANSION`. A vanilla `crit: 14` means "per 1% crit"; a TBC item carries +20 crit
*rating*, so the vanilla set doesn't degrade on TBC, it mis-ranks by ~20×. The TBC presets
are written in the same per-1% terms and divided by one `RATING_CONV` table (level-70
constants), so both sets stay comparable and the conversion is auditable in one place.
Ids are reused where a spec exists in both, so saved builds and `?weights=` links keep
resolving. `expertise` uses 15.77, **not** the familiar 3.94: 3.94 rating = 1 expertise,
but 1 expertise = 0.25% of attacks undodged, so a full 1% costs 15.77 — using 3.94 would
value it 4× over. Landing on hit's number is the result, not a coincidence.

**Gems** (`enchant_text.stats`, `gem_properties`). A socketed gem and an item's socket
bonus are both `SpellItemEnchantment` rows, whose DBC carries three `(type, amount, arg)`
triples — now extracted (`eff`) alongside the display text. Type 5 is a stat (arg =
ITEM_MOD id), type 4 a resistance, and **type 3 is a SPELL** — which most TBC gems are, so
"+8 Spell Damage" is spell 9398, not a parseable stat line. Type 3 resolves through the
very same `statsFromAuras` that builds `item_stats`, so a gem and an item granting the same
effect can't disagree. Two traps: an enchant may store one displayed rating under several
per-attack-type ITEM_MODs (2735 "+8 Critical Strike Rating" = melee-crit 8 **and**
ranged-crit 8), so ITEM_MOD contributions are a per-key **max**, not a sum; and base-stat
gems are aura 29 (MOD_STAT), which `AURA_STAT` never needed — it's behind a `baseStats`
opt-in that only the enchant pass uses, because ~120 Turtle / ~170 TBC items also carry
that aura and enabling it for `item_stats` would move their scores. ~95% of gems derive
real stats; the rest are procs or stats with no criteria key, and still show their text.
The character sheet counts gems in **totals** but not in the upgrade finder's baseline —
scoring a gemmed item against un-gemmed candidates would hide upgrades you'd re-socket.

**Share + JSON links are main-only** (`config.js` `HAS_OG_API`). The unfurl Worker and the
public JSON API are both generated from the MAIN dataset's DB, and an entry id is not a
shared namespace: item 23425 is Adamantite Ore on TBC and absent from Turtle entirely, so
off `main` those links answer about a different game -- the API returns a Cloudflare 404
HTML page (not JSON) and the unfurl degrades to a generic site card. So on other datasets
the Share button copies the plain in-app URL (built from `location.pathname`, NOT
`BASE_URL`, so it keeps the `/tbc/cmangos/` directory) and the JSON button isn't rendered.
This costs `dev` its rich unfurl, which is the right trade: it previously handed out links
that sent the recipient to main's copy of the page. Real coverage for the other rows means
per-dataset build targets + R2 prefixes + Worker routing (a known parity gap, see
notes/plan-content-origin-and-variants.md).

**Creature thumbnails are per-dataset**, via `config.js` `WEBTHUMB_BRANCH` /
`OWN_MODEL_THUMBS` (and the new registry field `core`, "turtle" | "cmangos" -- distinct
from `expansion`, since vanilla/cmangos is 1.12 content but not Turtle). A display_id is
NOT a shared namespace across games, which breaks `modelThumbUrl` two ways on TBC: Wowhead
serves a separate webthumb set per branch and the TBC ids 404 on `classic` (measured: only
60% of sampled TBC display_ids resolve there vs 100% on `tbc`), and our OWN renders are
Turtle-client models, so serving them on TBC would show a confidently wrong creature --
1,007 TBC display_ids collide with a Turtle-custom render (display 21015 is Turtle's
"Keeper Blackforge" but TBC's "Garek"). Hence: own renders only when `core === "turtle"`,
Wowhead branch from `EXPANSION`. vanilla/cmangos collides on just 2, but is gated the same
way for the same reason. The `render-model-thumbs.py` worklist is likewise Turtle-scoped.

**"Obtainable" for the upgrade finder** is four conditions, and one was a trap:
`'unobtainable'` is itself an `item_sources` row, so the finder's `EXISTS (… item_sources …)`
check treated *being flagged junk* as proof of a source and let every test/placeholder item
through. It now also requires `hidden = 0`, no `unobtainable` row, and
`duration = 0` — `duration` is a self-destruct timer, i.e. encounter props rather than gear
(Kael'thas' Warp Slicer & co at 15 min, Andonisus at 5, the Hallow's End masks). 35 such
equippable items on TBC, all correctly caught, no permanent gear affected.

### Binary assets live on R2, not git

Client-derived **image** trees are no longer committed. CI still can't regenerate them
(no game client), but committing them cost ~74 MB / 6.5k files and every new matrix row
(`vanilla/cmangos`, `tbc/cmangos`, …) multiplied it. **R2 is now their source of truth.**

| set | R2 prefix / local dir |
|---|---|
| zone parchments | `maps/`, `maps-<dataset>/` |
| minimap pyramids | `minimap/`, `minimap-<dataset>/` |
| creature model thumbs | `model-thumbs/` |
| extracted game audio | `sounds/`, `sounds-<dataset>/` |

- `scripts/lib/assets.mjs` defines the sets; `scripts/data/assets-manifest.json`
  (committed, ~1.2 MB) indexes every file as `[sha256-12, size]`. It jumped from ~250 KB
  when the audio sets landed — 10.7k more files at ~1.8 GB, which is now the bulk of both
  the manifest and the R2 bucket.
- `bun run assets` downloads them (hash-verified on arrival — a truncated tile is worse
  than a missing one). Needed only for a LOCAL run that should show maps.
- `bun run publish` rescans + uploads after an `extract-*.py` run, then rewrites the
  manifest. Uploads go straight to R2's S3 API, signed in-process by `scripts/lib/r2.mjs`
  (SigV4 via `node:crypto`) — **no `aws` CLI and no SDK**: the CLI spawns a process per
  object, unusable for a 3.5k-file tile pyramid. Needs `R2_ACCOUNT_ID`,
  `R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` (`R2_BUCKET` optional). Only files whose
  hash differs from the committed manifest upload, so a re-run resumes; `--dry-run`,
  `--only <sets>` (prefix match), `--force`, `--manifest-only`.
- **CI never syncs these.** The old `aws s3 sync … --delete` steps were removed from
  `deploy.yml` and `deploy-cmangos.yml`: run against a checkout that no longer has the
  files, `--delete` would erase the whole set off R2. `publish-assets.mjs` likewise never
  passes `--delete`, and reports files that vanished locally rather than deleting them.
- **There is no second copy.** Enable R2 object versioning, or keep the extractor outputs
  archived somewhere, before treating this as durable. (Old revisions do remain in git
  history, which is why `git rm --cached` didn't shrink the ~318 MB `.git`.)
- Still committed: `assets/icons/custom/` (the *source* the atlas is packed from) and
  `public/icons/` (0.95 MB — `config.js` `getAtlasUrls()` keeps a Pages origin in its
  fallback chain, which only works if they ship in the Pages artifact).

## Gotchas

- **Don't commit built data.** It's regenerated by CI from the server repo. The
  the exceptions are **client-derived** assets CI can't regenerate, so they're
  committed: custom icons (`assets/icons/custom/`, `public/icons/custom-atlas.*`,
  `scripts/data/item-display-supplement.json`, `scripts/data/spell-icon-map.json`,
  `scripts/data/spell-lookups.json`), zone bounds
  (`scripts/data/zones.json` — the parchment *images* are R2-only, see above),
  per-area ADT bounds (`scripts/data/subzone-bounds.json`
  via `extract-area-bounds.py`, for exact coord→zone), and the "minimap" POI sprite
  sheet `public/icons/poi-atlas.webp` (16-col, 32px grid; sourced from the
  WowClassicGrindBot atlas). `Elite` at [11,14] is the boss-marker skull; the zone +
  world map markers and the layer-control legend draw their per-category icons from
  it via the `CAT_ICON`/`OBJ_ICON` cell map in `src/zonemap.js` (cells verified
  against the art -- the upstream `icon_atlas.js` names are unreliable). Plus
  item-set names + bonus spells + membership (`scripts/data/item-sets.json` via
  `extract-item-sets.py`, from the client `ItemSet.dbc`; each set carries its DBC
  `ItemID_*` member list, and build-db **corrects `items.set_id` to it** —
  authoritative over the server dump's `item_template.set`, which mis-groups some
  re-itemized/orphaned pieces into the wrong set, issue #319), and skill-line categories
  (`scripts/data/skill-lines.json` via `extract-skill-lines.py`, from the client
  `SkillLine.dbc`; build-db joins these onto `skill_line_ability` to set
  `spells.category` for the browse filter), gather-node skills
  (`scripts/data/locks.json` via `extract-locks.py`, from the client `Lock.dbc`;
  maps a gameobject's `data0` lockId -> `mining`/`herbalism` so build-db sets
  `gameobjects.gather`, splitting veins/herbs out of the map's `Obj: Chest` bucket),
  and hunter-pet family metadata (`scripts/data/creature-families.json` via
  `extract-creature-families.py`, from the client `CreatureFamily.dbc`: family id ->
  name + diet/PetFoodMask + ability skill line + icon; plus the curated
  `scripts/data/pet-families.json` = per-family role + Health/Armor/Damage stat
  modifiers + shared-ability membership. build-db ingests `creature_template.beast_family`
  + the `type_flags` TAMEABLE bit, then derives the `pet_families` / `pet_ability` /
  `pet_ability_rank` / `pet_ability_spell` / `pet_family_ability` tables — the ability
  catalog comes from the shipped `spells` table (skill 261 "Beast Training" holds one
  empty "learn" stub per rank; build-db resolves each to the REAL cast spell in a family
  skill line for a real tooltip) + each family's own skill line, so TW-custom families
  (Serpent/Fox/Moth) and their custom abilities are covered automatically. `pet_ability_spell`
  maps every pet-ability spell entry → ability/rank/level so the spell page shows a "tame a
  beast to learn this rank" panel. Powers `?pets` / `?petfamily=<id>`, the NPC-page
  "Tameable" badge, and the pet-ability spell-page panel),
  and the seamless-world-map transform
  manifest (`scripts/data/minimap.json` via `extract-minimap.py`; the tile pyramid
  itself is R2-only, NOT committed — see "Binary assets live on R2"). Plus talent-tree
  structure (`scripts/data/talents.json` via `extract-talents.py`, from the client
  `Talent.dbc`/`TalentTab.dbc`; real all-class Turtle trees, re-run on client
  changes) + random-suffix stats (`scripts/data/random-suffix.json` via
  `extract-random-suffix.py`, from the client `ItemRandomProperties.dbc` +
  `SpellItemEnchantment.dbc`; maps a rolled `suffixId` -> "of the Bear" name + stats.
  build-db loads it into `random_suffix` and joins the SQL-dump
  `item_enchantment_template` into `suffix_pool` + `items.rolls_suffix` so the item
  page lists the pool and the character sheet resolves a rolled suffix) + the
  class-picker emblems (`public/icons/class/<slug>.webp` via
  `extract-class-icons.py`, cropped from the client character-create sheet; served
  from `${ASSETS_BASE}icons/class/`, synced to R2 by deploy.yml's `public/icons`
  sync). See "Custom
  icons" / `scripts/extract-maps.py` / "Seamless world map". Plus scripted-transform
  spawn links (`scripts/data/scripted-spawn-links.json`): creatures with no static
  `creature` row that a server **C++** script swaps in at another NPC's location (the
  transform is in `../tortoise-wow/src/scripts/world/*.cpp`, not ingestible SQL — e.g.
  the "Stave of the Ancients" demons transform in place from a friendly NPC). Maps the
  spawn-less entry -> the entry whose `spawns`/`spawn_points` it inherits, so build-db
  can still map it. Committed (CI has no server `src/`); hand-maintained from the
  scriptdev enums — extend when new transforms are found. Plus script-spawned instance
  bosses (`scripts/data/instance-bosses.json` via `extract-instance-bosses.mjs`): a
  boss placed by a C++ instance script has no static `creature` spawn, so the SQL can't
  tell which dungeon it's in. The extract parses each `src/scripts/dungeons/<instance>/`
  folder → `creature_instance(entry, map)`, letting the character upgrade finder name
  the instance for such a boss (e.g. Tuten'kash → Razorfen Downs). Committed (CI has no
  server `src/`); re-run on scriptdev changes. Plus the vanilla-1.12 id allowlist +
  `edited` field-diff set (`scripts/data/vanilla-ids.json` via `extract-vanilla-ids.mjs`,
  from the cmangos Classic SQLite DB + a diff of the built Turtle DB): build-db flags
  items/creatures/quests `custom = id NOT IN vanilla OR id IN edited` — the `edited` set
  catches Turtle's in-place repurposes/rebalances of vanilla ids (items = name/gameplay
  diff, creatures/quests = name/title diff), applied only to Turtle builds. Falls back to
  an id threshold if the JSON is absent. Committed (CI has no cmangos DB); re-run on a new
  cmangos Classic DB release or material Turtle world-data change.
- **Zone assignment is ADT-exact.** Each spawn's `spawn_points.zone` is precomputed
  in build-db from `scripts/data/subzone-bounds.json` (per-AreaTable bounding boxes
  extracted from the client ADT terrain chunks by `extract-area-bounds.py`): the
  smallest box containing the point is its real sub-area, walked up the
  `area_template.zone_id` hierarchy to the render zone. This replaced the old loose
  WorldMapArea-rectangle test, which overlapped badly (Jory Zaga → Moonglade instead
  of Darkshore, Taerar → Azshara instead of Ashenvale, oversized custom-zone boxes
  swallowing real zones). Zone pages, the NPC-page map/label, and all location
  columns read this one field. Fallback to the smallest WMA box only where ADTs give
  no area (~0.4% of spawns); `subzone-bounds.json` absent ⇒ WMA-box behaviour.
- **World-drop reference pools are intentionally excluded** from `drops`
  (`REF_THRESHOLD` in build-db). Items reachable only via those won't list
  individual creatures — by design (they're world drops).
- **`items.world_drop`** (build-db, set when an item drops from ≥25 distinct
  creature loot tables — ubiquitous greens/gems/cloth) flags world drops so the
  **zone Items tab excludes them** (`Q_ZONE_LOOT`); they aren't characteristic of
  any zone. Item/NPC pages still show them normally.
- **Boss = unique spawn** (`spawns.cnt == 1`) within a map.
- **PowerShell is the shell.** Avoid backticks inside `node -e`/`bun -e` one
  liners (they break); write a temp `.mjs` and run it instead. Bash tool is also
  available for POSIX. Native paths like `/x/...` get mangled to `X:\x\...` by
  node — use `X:/...`.
- LF→CRLF warnings on commit are expected on Windows; harmless.

## Deploy

`.github/workflows/deploy.yml` (push to `main`): sparse-checks out the server
repo's `sql/base`, builds the DB with Bun, runs `vite build`, deploys `dist/` to
Pages. Pages base path is `/tortoise-db-viewer/` (`vite.config.js`; override with
`BASE_PATH`). Heavy assets (DB, zone maps, icon atlas) are pushed to Cloudflare R2
(`aws s3 sync`, S3 API) and served from `VITE_ASSETS_BASE` to spare Pages bandwidth.

**Asset origin is a repo variable.** The Build-site step reads
`vars.ASSET_BASE_URL` (Actions → Variables) for `VITE_DATA_BASE`/`_DEV`/
`VITE_ASSETS_BASE`; unset falls back to the rate-limited `pub-*.r2.dev` public URL.
Set it to an R2 **custom domain** (e.g. `https://cdn.tortoiseclothing.org`, no
trailing slash) to drop the r2.dev throttling — after the custom domain's SSL is
Active in the R2 dashboard, and with the bucket **CORS policy** allowing the site
origins (the custom domain uses bucket CORS, unlike the permissive r2.dev default).
The S3-API upload steps still target the `tortoise-db-viewer` bucket directly and
are unaffected.

**World-map tiles do NOT sync via CI** — they aren't in the repo (see "Binary assets
live on R2"), so CI has nothing to upload and, critically, must not try: the old sync
passed `--delete` and would wipe the set off R2 from an empty checkout. The frontend
reads `${VITE_ASSETS_BASE}minimap/<map>/{z}/{x}/{y}.webp`; the committed
`scripts/data/minimap.json` (bundled by Vite) supplies the transform. Re-run
`extract-minimap.py` on client map changes, then `bun scripts/publish-assets.mjs`.

### Two datasets: `main` + `dev` (server `1181dev` branch)

The site serves **two** copies of the DB and lets the visitor toggle the source
(`Main | Dev` pill in the top bar):

- **main** — built from the server repo's default branch, at `/` (R2 prefix
  `data/`). Unchanged behaviour.
- **dev** — built from the `1181dev` feature branch, served at the **`/dev/`**
  path (R2 prefix `data-dev/`). Refreshed **hourly** when `1181dev` gets a commit.

**Only the DB + `version.json` differ per dataset** — maps/icons/minimap/tt/OG are
branch-independent and shared (owned by the main deploy). Mechanics:

- **Build:** `build-db.mjs` takes `DATA_SUBDIR` (default `data`); the dev build
  runs `SQL_DIR=…/1181dev/sql/base DATA_SUBDIR=data-dev`.
- **Frontend dataset pick** (`src/config.js`): `DATASET` is `dev` when the path is
  under `<base>/dev/` (or `?db=dev`, the local-dev override — the vite dev server
  has no `/dev/` file); it selects `VITE_DATA_BASE_DEV` vs `VITE_DATA_BASE`. Dev is
  **R2-only** (no Pages mirror — a mirror flip would silently serve *main's* DB).
- **Path-based, sticky-by-relative-link:** query routing means the only path we
  must serve is `dev/index.html` (a build-time copy of the app shell — deploy.yml
  "Emit /dev app shell"). Internal links are relative (`href="?item=…"`) and
  `navigate()` feeds that to `pushState`, so every click under `/dev/` stays under
  `/dev/`. No per-link threading, no localStorage.
- **OPFS cache** (`src/db-worker.js`) is keyed `/tortoise-<dataset>-<version>.sqlite`
  so both datasets persist side-by-side (switching is download-free) without
  evicting each other.
- **CI:** `deploy-dev.yml` (manual/`workflow_dispatch`) builds ONLY the dev DB and
  `aws s3 cp`s it to `data-dev/` on R2 — no Pages redeploy (a new content hash
  auto-invalidates clients). `watch-dev.yml` polls `1181dev` **hourly** (distinct
  cache key from `watch-upstream.yml`) and dispatches `deploy-dev.yml` on a new SHA.
- **Rollout:** enabling the toggle needs one normal `main` deploy first (ships the
  frontend + `VITE_DATA_BASE_DEV` + `/dev/index.html`), then one `deploy-dev` run
  (populates `data-dev/`). After that, dev refreshes are pure R2 uploads.
- **Changelog (`?changelog`):** each `deploy-dev` run diffs the freshly-built DB
  against the previous one (downloaded from R2) via `scripts/build-changelog.mjs`
  (`ATTACH` + anti-joins over content tables + `spawn_points` deltas — NOT `sqldiff`,
  which drowns in VACUUM/FTS/stat noise), then prepends a dated section to an
  accumulated `data-dev/changelog.json`. The `?changelog` view (`showChangelog` in
  `main.js`) fetches `${DATA_BASE}changelog.json` (dataset-aware) and links each
  entity. Dev-only for now; the main dataset has no file and shows a pointer to the
  Dev view (the 404 is benign — the view handles it). A footer "What's new" link
  (relative, so it stays on the active dataset) opens it.
