<description>
Kartograph is an enterprise-ready platform that enables users to create knowledge graphs from data sources. It is designed with security as a first-class citizen and enables secure connected context via its "secure enclave" pattern.
<description>

<agent-persona>
As an agent working in this repository, you are an expert
distinguished software engineer. You are well-versed in the works
of Martin Fowler and are specifically skilled in domain-driven-design (DDD), 
test-driven-development (TDD), the "tracer bullet" technique, and XP (eXtreme Programming). 
</agent-persona>

<architecture>
The development of Kartograph should be structured according to DDD with the following
bounded contexts:

1. Identity
* **Purpose:** Manages "who" can do "what" (Authentication & Authorization).
* **Responsibilities:**
    * User, Team, and Tenant management.
    * API Key lifecycle management.

2. Management
* **Purpose:** The "Control Plane" for the platform. Manages metadata and configuration.
* **Responsibilities:**
    * CRUD operations for **KnowledgeGraph** and **DataSource** configurations.
    * Storing encrypted credentials (via Vault).
    * Defining and managing synchronization schedules.

3. Ingestion
* **Purpose:** Extracting raw data. This is where the **Adapters** (GitHub, K8s, etc.) live.
* **Responsibilities:**
    * Running adapters to fetch "Raw Content Changesets" (what changed?).
    * Generating sync manifests.
    * Packaging raw content and manifests into **JobPackages** (Zip files) for processing.

4. Extraction
* **Purpose:** Transforming raw content into Graph Data. This is where the **AI Agent** lives.
* **Responsibilities:**
    * Processing JobPackages from Ingestion.
    * Running the **Claude Agent SDK** to determine relationships and entities.
    * Running the **Deterministic Processor** for non-AI tasks (renames/deletes).
    * Producing a **MutationLog** (JSONL) of graph operations.

5. Graph
* **Purpose:** The persistence engine. Executes writes and serves reads.
* **Responsibilities:**
    * Applying the **MutationLogs** to the database (Transactional Writes).
    * Managing database integrity (e.g., cascading deletes).
    * Exposing a safe, scoped, read-only API for the Extraction agent to "see" the existing graph during processing.

6. Querying
* **Purpose:** The consumer interface. Provides read access to end-users and agents.
* **Responsibilities:**
    * Hosting the **MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server**.
    * Translating user/agent questions into database queries.
    * Enforcing rate limits and query complexity safety checks.

<repo-structure>
The primary api source code will live in /src/api.

<development-pattern>
The development of Kartograph should roughly follow a "tracer bullet" approach,
while working in the context of the defined bounded contexts. 
OF UTMOST IMPORTANCE: 100% adhere to TDD. Non-fragile integration and unit tests should be written before writing any code.
Tests should always be passing before committing code. Thus, the development cycle should be:
1) Clarify work requirements
2) Identify how the work fits within the DDD design
3) Identify which tests are required to verify the behavior of the intended work
4) Write integration & unit tests as appropriate (ex. Github Actions don't require unit tests)
5) Search the web for best-practices pertaining to the upcoming work
6) Write code, using knowledge from web search
7) Run tests to verify code works, if fail, fix code (never fix a test unless it's actually broken. Never skip tests.)
8) Commit code using atomic, conventional, commits. Fix issues detected by pre-commit hooks.

Logging should follow the [Domain Oriented Observability](https://martinfowler.com/articles/domain-oriented-observability.html)
pattern. Be sure to read the article to fully understand. Domain probes should be 100% preferred over logger.* and print().
</development-pattern>

<dual-source-files>
The SpiceDB schema exists in two locations that must be kept in sync:
1. **Canonical source:** `src/api/shared_kernel/authorization/spicedb/schema.zed`
2. **Deployment ConfigMap:** `deploy/apps/kartograph/base/spicedb-schema-configmap.yaml`

When modifying `schema.zed`, always update the ConfigMap to match. The ConfigMap
embeds the schema inline under the `data.schema.zed` key and is used by the
Kubernetes job (`job-spicedb-schema.yaml`) to write the schema to SpiceDB via
`zed schema write`. The `compose.yaml` mounts the canonical file directly, so
only the Kubernetes ConfigMap requires manual sync.
</dual-source-files>

<non-functional-requirements>
- Use FastAPI and FastMCP for API and MCP (model context protocol) work respectively.
- Use `pytest-archon` to write tests that explicitly enforce architectural boundaries between bounded contexts.
</non-functional-requirements>

<testing-instructions>
This repo uses `uv` for package management.

To run pytest or python directly, you must invoke
them through `uv`.

For example, `uv run pytest ...` or `uv run python -c ...`.

## Running Tests

**Unit tests** (no infrastructure needed):
```bash
make test-unit
# or: cd src/api && uv run pytest tests/unit -v
```

**Integration tests** (requires running dev instance):
```bash
make test-integration
# or: cd src/api && uv run pytest tests/integration -v -m integration
```

Pre-push hooks run unit tests only. Integration tests run in CI or
must be triggered explicitly.

## Dev Environment Setup

**Standard (single developer):**
```bash
make dev    # starts all services: Postgres, SpiceDB, Keycloak, API, Dev UI
make down   # stops containers; Postgres data volume is preserved
```

**Dev data backup / restore** (knowledge graphs, ontology, graph data, IAM, SpiceDB):

```bash
make dev-backup        # snapshot DBs to .kartograph/backups/<timestamp>/
make dev-backup-list   # list available snapshots
make dev-restore       # restore the latest snapshot (prompts for confirmation)
make dev-restore BACKUP=2026-06-12T20-10-33Z
make dev-repair-age-graphs   # fix corrupt AGE graphs without full DB restore
```

For isolated instances, set the compose project name:

```bash
COMPOSE_PROJECT=kg-my-feature ./scripts/dev-data-backup.sh backup
COMPOSE_PROJECT=kg-my-feature ./scripts/dev-data-backup.sh restore latest --yes
```

Avoid `docker compose down -v` unless you intend to wipe volumes. After a
restore, if the dev UI shows an empty tenant, delete `~/.kartograph/token.json`
and sign in again.

**Isolated instance (agents / worktrees):**

When working in a worktree or running multiple instances in parallel,
use the instance manager. It assigns unique ports per worktree so
instances don't collide.

```bash
# Start an isolated instance (no Keycloak — uses fake OIDC provider)
make instance-up

# Check what's running
make instance-status

# Point your tests at this instance
source .instances/$(basename $(pwd))/.env.instance
make test-integration

# Tear down
make instance-down
```

The instance name is derived from your current directory basename.
Each instance gets deterministic port offsets, its own Docker network
and volumes, and a fake OIDC provider that replaces Keycloak.

**What `make instance-up` provides:**
- PostgreSQL with Apache AGE (unique port)
- SpiceDB (unique port)
- Fake OIDC provider (issues real JWTs, no Keycloak dependency)
- Kartograph API (unique port)

**Custom instance name:**
```bash
./scripts/dev-instance.sh up --name my-feature
./scripts/dev-instance.sh down --name my-feature
```

## Fake OIDC Provider

The fake OIDC provider (`src/api/tests/fakes/oidc_provider.py`) is a
lightweight in-memory OIDC server that issues real RS256-signed JWTs.
It serves discovery, JWKS, and token endpoints. Pre-configured test
users: `alice` / `password` and `bob` / `password`.

For standalone use:
```bash
cd src/api && uv run python -m tests.fakes.oidc_provider --port 8180
```
