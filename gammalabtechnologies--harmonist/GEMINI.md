## User-facing language

Detect the language of the user's message and respond in that language.
A Russian message gets a Russian reply; a Japanese message gets a
Japanese reply; an English message gets an English reply.

**Keep English for everything that is not a direct user-facing sentence**:

- source code, configuration, commit messages, PR titles, branch names;
- `.cursor/memory/*.md` entries (`summary`, `body`, `tags`) — these are
  machine-readable state shared across sessions and must stay stable;
- subagent invocation prompts — the `AGENT: <slug>` line, the
  PROJECT PRECEDENCE preamble, and the task description you pass into
  the Task tool;
- agent bodies under `agents/`, `AGENTS.md`, `integration-prompt.md`,
  hooks, telemetry, incident logs;
- the structured Output Format block at the end of a response (field
  labels stay English, only the free-text values translate).

The principle: **what the human reads in this conversation** follows
the user's language; **what another agent, a hook, a future session,
or git history reads** stays English.

<!-- pack-owned:begin id="precedence" -->
## Precedence

When multiple sources of advice collide (this file vs a persona agent's
body vs upstream documentation), resolve in this exact order:

1. **This file (project `AGENTS.md`)** — Platform Stack, Modules,
   Invariants, Resilience, Rollback, Memory, Enforcement. All
   non-negotiable for this project.
2. **Persona agent bodies under `agents/`** — general best practice for
   their specialty. May suggest approaches that are not appropriate
   here. If so, follow (1) and call out the conflict in your response:
   *"The `<slug>` persona suggests X; this project's Invariants require
   Y. Going with Y, flagging for review."*
3. **Upstream vendor docs or general wisdom** — last resort when
   (1) and (2) are silent.

Every subagent invocation MUST include a project-context preamble so
the persona sees the authoritative rules:

```
AGENT: <slug>
PROJECT PRECEDENCE: <invariants + modules + platform snippet>

<your task description>
```

The preamble is produced by `harmonist/agents/scripts/project_context.py`
(see "Enforcement" below). Calling a subagent without it means the
persona operates on generic defaults and may violate project invariants
without noticing.

## Platform Stack

<!-- CUSTOMIZE: Replace with your actual stack -->

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Backend | [language, framework, ORM, database, cache] |
| Frontend | [framework, language, bundler, styling, state] |
| External APIs | [list third-party services] |
| Infra | [containers, CI/CD, deploy method] |
| Tests | [test frameworks, tools] |
| Migrations | [tool, current version] |

## Modules

<!-- CUSTOMIZE: Your project's bounded contexts -->

| Module | Responsibility | Typical owner tags |
|--------|---------------|--------------------|
| `module-a/` | Description | `backend`, `api` |
| `module-b/` | Description | `frontend`, `web` |

<!-- pack-owned:begin id="agent-pool" -->
## Agent Pool — single unified catalog

All agents live under `harmonist/agents/<category>/`. There is no
separate "core" layer. The full roster and its metadata is machine-readable:

```
harmonist/agents/index.json      ← routing table (generated)
harmonist/agents/SCHEMA.md       ← frontmatter contract
```

Every agent entry in `index.json` carries:

- `slug` — stable identity (filename stem, unique across the pool)
- `category` — bucket (`orchestration`, `review`, `engineering`, …)
- `protocol` — `strict` (orchestration-bound, structured output) or `persona`
  (free-form specialist)
- `readonly` — whether the agent may edit files
- `is_background` — whether it runs long suites asynchronously
- `tags` — searchable labels (e.g. `security`, `postgres`, `ton`, `react`)
- `description` — one-liner for routing

Categories (counts mirrored from `agents/index.json`; `check_pack_health.py`
fails if this table drifts from the index):

| Category | Role | Protocol | Count |
|----------|------|----------|-------|
| `orchestration` | Scout before implementation, map files to agents | strict | 2 |
| `review` | Readonly reviewers (security, quality, QA, SRE, regression) | strict | 6 |
| `engineering` | Backend, frontend, DevOps, data, embedded, AI engineering | persona | 46 |
| `design` | UI/UX, brand, accessibility, visual | persona | 8 |
| `testing` | QA, performance, API testing, evidence | persona | 8 |
| `product` | PM, sprints, feedback, trends | persona | 5 |
| `project-management` | Planning, studio ops | persona | 7 |
| `marketing` | Growth, SEO, content, social | persona | 30 |
| `paid-media` | PPC, tracking, audits | persona | 7 |
| `sales` | Outbound, deals, proposals | persona | 8 |
| `finance` | FPA, bookkeeping, tax | persona | 6 |
| `support` | Customer support, compliance, analytics | persona | 5 |
| `academic` | Research, psychology, history | persona | 5 |
| `game-development` | Unity, Unreal, Godot, Roblox, Blender | persona | 20 |
| `spatial-computing` | XR, visionOS, WebXR | persona | 6 |
| `specialized` | Blockchain, MCP, Salesforce, ZK, niche | persona | 17 |

<!-- pack-owned:begin id="routing-protocol" -->
## Routing Protocol

Do **not** hard-code agent names. Route every task through the index.

### Task intake

1. Extract up to 5 relevance tags from the task description
   (e.g. "add escrow fee calculation" → `escrow`, `payments`, `backend`, `fintech`, `audit`).
2. **Filter by project domains first**: only agents whose `domains` ⊆
   `(project_domains ∪ {all})` are eligible. Project domains are
   declared in this file's Platform Stack / Modules and in the
   integration step. This hides irrelevant regional / vertical
   specialists (e.g. a TON project never sees WeChat or Xiaohongshu
   agents).
3. Intersect the eligible pool with `index.json`:
   - prefer agents where `tags` hits ≥ 2 of the extracted tags
   - tie-break by `category` match against module ownership
4. At least one agent is always selected. If the intersection is empty,
   fall back to `repo-scout` (category `orchestration`) and re-route from its
   report.

### Mandatory gates

Gates apply based on `category` / `tags`, NOT on agent name, so they keep
working when agents are added or renamed:

```
Trigger                                    → Required review agent(s)
auth / secrets / payments / admin / API    → tag:security, category:review
DB queries / caching / migrations / infra  → tag:performance | tag:observability, category:review
async / complex logic / error handling     → tag:review, category:review (code quality)
every write                                → category:review tag:qa (completeness/tests)
every code change                          → category:review tag:regression (bg suite)
```

Reviewers are `readonly: true` and `protocol: strict`. They return a
structured verdict the orchestrator can parse.

### Tie-breaking via `disambiguation`

When tag intersection returns 2+ candidates, consult
`index.json.disambiguation[<slug>]`:

- `peers` — slugs this agent is often confused with (symmetric edges).
- `note` — one-line guidance of the form "Use me for X; for Y delegate
  to `<slug>`."

The orchestrator should read the notes of every candidate in the
intersection and pick the one whose note best matches the task intent,
falling back to first-alphabetical only when all notes are silent.

Example: task "audit smart contract for reentrancy" tagged
`[security, smart-contracts, blockchain]` intersects with
`security-reviewer`, `engineering-security-engineer`,
`blockchain-security-auditor`. Their disambiguation notes:

- `security-reviewer`: "Strict readonly gate…"
- `engineering-security-engineer`: "Deep design-time security work…"
- `blockchain-security-auditor`: "Smart-contract-specific audit —
  exploits, gas abuse, known attack classes."

Pick `blockchain-security-auditor`. Easy.

### Rules

1. Start with `repo-scout` whenever the relevant files are not obvious.
2. State the plan before editing. List picked agents with reasoning.
3. One write agent per module at a time. Parallelism is allowed only across
   independent bounded contexts.
4. Invoke review agents per the trigger table above.
5. When tag intersection yields multiple candidates, consult their
   `disambiguation` notes before picking.
6. If still ambiguous — stop and ask the user, don't guess.
7. Small diffs over broad rewrites.

## Invariants

<!-- CUSTOMIZE: Your project's non-negotiable rules. Examples provided as a starting point. -->

1. No floating-point for money. Use BigDecimal / long / string-based decimals.
2. State machines: deterministic, idempotent, traceable transitions.
3. Migrations: append-only. Never modify existing migrations.
4. Secrets: NEVER log or expose API keys, tokens, passwords, mnemonics.
5. External calls: require retries, idempotency keys, compensation logic.
6. Evidence: every risky change leaves tests, logs, metrics, or a verifier report.

<!-- pack-owned:begin id="topology" -->
## Topology

<!-- CUSTOMIZE: Pick the topology that fits your project -->

| Topology | When to use | How it works |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| **Hierarchical** | Complex features, dependent steps | Orchestrator → write agent → reviewers, in order. |
| **Mesh** | Independent parallel tasks | Agents work simultaneously. No blocking between them. |
| **Pipeline** | Sequential transformation | Output of agent A → input of agent B → input of agent C. |
| **Star** | Review-heavy work | All writes report to one central reviewer (`tag:review`). |

Default: **Hierarchical** (orchestrator → write → review gate).
Switch to **Mesh** when `repo-scout` identifies independent bounded contexts.

<!-- pack-owned:end -->

<!-- pack-owned:begin id="agent-dependencies" -->
## Agent Dependencies

Define blocking relationships via categories/tags, not hard-coded slugs:

```
category:orchestration  →  any write agent
any write agent         →  category:review tag:qa
category:review tag:security  →  runs before tag:qa when the trigger table fires
category:review tag:performance → runs before tag:qa on DB/infra changes
category:review tag:review (code quality) → runs before tag:qa on async/logic changes
```

Rules:
- No circular dependencies (A blocks B, B blocks A).
- If task A blocks task B, finish A completely before starting B.
- Independent tasks run in parallel (mesh topology).

<!-- pack-owned:end -->

<!-- pack-owned:begin id="rollback-protocol" -->
## Rollback Protocol

If a multi-step task fails partway:

1. **Stop** — do not continue.
2. **Assess** — which steps completed, which failed.
3. **Rollback in reverse order (LIFO)** — undo step N, then N−1, then N−2.
4. **Log rollback errors separately** — a failed rollback is worse than the
   original failure.
5. **Report** — what was rolled back, what couldn't be, what needs manual
   intervention.

Database migrations are forward-only (Flyway, Alembic, Prisma). Write a
compensating migration instead.

---

<!-- pack-owned:end -->

<!-- pack-owned:begin id="enforcement" -->
## Enforcement

The protocol is backed by real Cursor hooks in `.cursor/hooks/` (see
`harmonist/hooks/README.md`). They observe the session and gate
the `stop` event so violations cannot pass silently.

### Subagent delegation contract

When you delegate via the Task subagent tool, the **first line of the
subagent prompt MUST be `AGENT: <slug>`** where `<slug>` matches the
filename stem of the agent under `agents/<category>/`. This is how the
hook verifies that a specific reviewer actually ran.

Example:

```
AGENT: qa-verifier

Verify the completeness of the diff in src/api/auth.ts, including new
endpoints, edge cases, and breaking-change risk.
```

Without the marker, the hook cannot credit the reviewer and the stop
gate will treat the reviewer as "not invoked".

### What the stop gate checks

If the session touched any file outside the ignored patterns:

1. At least one agent from `category: review` was invoked via Task
   (`require_any_reviewer`, default `true`).
2. Specifically `qa-verifier` was invoked (`require_qa_verifier`,
   default `true`).
3. `.cursor/memory/session-handoff.md` was updated during the session
   (`require_session_handoff_update`, default `true`).

If any check fails the hook returns a `followup_message` telling you
exactly what's missing. `loop_limit: 3` caps retries — after that Cursor
surfaces the last message to the user instead of looping.

### Explicit opt-out

For genuinely trivial turns where the protocol is theatre (typo fix in a
comment, markdown wording tweak), include this exact marker on its own
line somewhere in your final response:

```
PROTOCOL-SKIP: <one-line reason>
```

The hook logs the skip and allows completion. Abuse is detectable in
`.cursor/hooks/.state/activity.log`.

<!-- pack-owned:end -->

<!-- pack-owned:begin id="hook-phases" -->
## Hook Phases

### Pre-Task

1. Read `.cursor/memory/session-handoff.md`.
2. Load `harmonist/agents/index.json` and retain the agent pool in context.
3. Run `repo-scout` when file scope is unclear — map files, tests, invariants.
4. State the plan. List selected agents, order, and dependencies.
5. Assign a **correlation ID** for this task (e.g. `fix-modal-close-2026-04`) —
   use it in all memory entries.

### Execute

6. Delegate to one write agent at a time (or parallel for independent agents).
7. Lint check after each agent completes.
8. On failure — follow the Rollback Protocol above.

### Post-Task

9. Run review agents per the trigger table above.
10. Run the background regression agent (`tag:regression`, `is_background: true`).
11. Update `session-handoff.md` — what changed, new issues.
12. Append to `decisions.md` — significant choices. Include **correlation ID**.
13. Append to `patterns.md` — what worked / didn't. Include **correlation ID**.

---

<!-- pack-owned:end -->

<!-- pack-owned:begin id="memory" -->
## Memory

Memory is a **structured, validated contract**, not free-form markdown.
Every entry is a YAML frontmatter block delimited by
`<!-- memory-entry:start --> ... <!-- memory-entry:end -->`. The schema
lives at `harmonist/memory/SCHEMA.md` (Schema v1).

| File | Purpose | When to update |
|------|---------|---------------|
| `.cursor/memory/session-handoff.md` | State snapshots. Latest = authoritative. | End of every task |
| `.cursor/memory/decisions.md` | Append-only decision log | On significant architectural choices |
| `.cursor/memory/patterns.md` | Lessons learned | After completing tasks, when something reusable emerged |

### The CLI is the only supported write path

```
python3 .cursor/memory/memory.py append \
  --file session-handoff --kind state --status done \
  --summary '<one line>' \
  --tags '<comma-separated>' \
  --body '<freeform markdown body>'
```

The CLI reads the active correlation_id from the enforcement hooks, fills
in `id` / `at` automatically, and validates the resulting block before it
lands. Direct hand-edits are allowed but must still pass `validate.py` —
the stop hook runs the validator and blocks completion on invalid files.

### Correlation IDs are hook-generated

Every task gets one `correlation_id` of the form `<session_id>-<task_seq>`,
generated at session start by the hooks and advanced on each successful
`stop`. The LLM does not invent IDs. Read the current one via
`python3 .cursor/memory/memory.py current-id`.

### Read at session start

The `sessionStart` hook automatically injects the last 3 state entries and
the last 3 decisions into the prompt, so you cannot silently skip reading
memory. Treat them as authoritative context before planning.

### Privacy

`.cursor/memory/*.md` WILL contain project-sensitive data. Default
guidance: add it to the project's `.gitignore`. For team-shared entries
use `*.shared.md` variants (e.g. `decisions.shared.md`) and review before
commit. NEVER write raw secrets — use `<PLACEHOLDER>` instead.

## Resilience

<!-- CUSTOMIZE: Your external dependencies -->

| Concern | Policy |
|---------|--------|
| External APIs | Exponential backoff with jitter: 1s → 2s → 4s, max 30s. Fail after 3 retries. |
| Deploys | Verify health post-restart. No response in 30s → check logs. |
| DB migrations | Can lock tables. Plan maintenance window for large ALTERs. Forward-only — no DROP in rollback. |
| Parallel agents | Max 3 concurrent. Sequential for dependent tasks. |
| Rate limits (429) | Back off immediately. Do not retry faster than the limit allows. |
| Circuit breaker | After 5 consecutive failures to same service → stop calling for 60s → retry once → if OK, resume. |
