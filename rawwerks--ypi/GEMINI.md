> Launch long-running tasks in tmux with a sentinel file. The `notify-done` extension

# Agent Instructions — ypi

## Running Prose Programs & Background Tasks
Launch long-running tasks in tmux with a sentinel file. The `notify-done` extension
watches `/tmp/ypi-signal-*` and **injects a message into your conversation** when
the task finishes — no sleeping, no polling, no `tmux capture-pane` loops.
**How it works:**
- Idle → `triggerTurn` fires immediately, you get a new turn
- Busy (mid-tool-execution) → message is **steered** in, delivered after the current tool finishes
- Either way, the notification appears in your message history and you respond to it
```bash
# Launch with sentinel (you'll be woken up when it finishes)
tmux send-keys -t eval:land "cd ~/Documents/GitHub/ypi && rp ypi .prose/land.prose; echo done > /tmp/ypi-signal-${YPI_INSTANCE_ID}-land" Enter
# That's it. Keep working on other things. You'll get a message like:
#   ⚡ Background task "land" completed: done
# ...and a new turn is triggered so you can respond to it.
```
**IMPORTANT: Do NOT poll or sleep-loop waiting for background tasks.**
Do not `sleep && tmux capture-pane` in a loop. Do not check progress unless
asked. Just keep working — the extension will interrupt you when it's ready.

**Sentinel naming:** `/tmp/ypi-signal-${YPI_INSTANCE_ID}-{name}` — always include
`$YPI_INSTANCE_ID` so the signal reaches THIS instance, not a sibling. The `{name}`
part appears in the notification. File contents become the notification body.
The file is deleted after consumption.
**Key programs:**
- `rp ypi .prose/land.prose` — "land it" / "land the plane": tests, push, handoff
- `rp ypi .prose/release.prose confirm_release='Approved.'` — cut an npm release
- `rp ypi .prose/check-upstream.prose` — verify Pi compatibility
- `rp ypi .prose/incorporate-insight.prose insight='...'` — propagate an insight across the repo

## Version Control: Use jj, not git

This repo uses **jj** (Jujutsu) for version control. Git is only for GitHub sync.

```bash
# Working with changes
jj status                    # What's changed
jj diff                      # See the diff
jj describe -m "message"     # Describe current change
jj new                       # Start a new change on top

# Pushing to GitHub
jj bookmark set master       # Point master at current change
jj git push                  # Push to GitHub

# Reviewing sub-agent work
jj log                       # See all changes including sub-agent workspaces
jj diff -r <change-id>       # Review a sub-agent's edits
jj squash --from <change-id> # Absorb a sub-agent's work into yours
jj abandon <change-id>       # Discard a sub-agent's work
```

**Never use `git add`, `git commit`, or `git push` directly.** jj manages git
under the hood. Using git directly creates confusion and potential conflicts.

Sub-agents get their own jj workspaces automatically (via `rlm_query`). Their
edits appear as separate changes in `jj log` that you can review and absorb.

## You Are The Recursion

When you run under `ypi`, **you are a recursive LLM**. You have `rlm_query` on
your PATH. You can spawn sub-LLMs. Those sub-LLMs can spawn sub-sub-LLMs. This
is not a metaphor — it's your actual execution environment.

This repo builds the infrastructure that makes YOU work. When you modify
`rlm_query`, `SYSTEM_PROMPT.md`, or `ypi`, you are modifying yourself.
Tread carefully, test constantly.

## Meta-Awareness

**Check your depth:**
```bash
echo "I am at depth $RLM_DEPTH of $RLM_MAX_DEPTH"
```

**Know your constraints:**
- At deeper depths, prefer direct answers over spawning more sub-calls
- Your sub-LLMs share the same system prompt and tools you have
- At `RLM_MAX_DEPTH`, sub-calls become plain LM calls (no bash, no tools)
- Every `rlm_query` call costs time and tokens — be intentional

**Dogfooding rule:** When implementing changes to the recursive infrastructure,
use that same infrastructure to help. Delegate sub-tasks to `rlm_query`. If the
delegation fails, that's a bug you just found.

## Architectural Invariants

Three properties make ypi work. All are tested (E7, E8 in test_e2e.sh):

1. **Self-similarity** — Same prompt, same tools, same agent at every depth. No specialized roles. The intelligence is in decomposition, not specialization.
2. **Self-hosting** — SYSTEM_PROMPT.md (SECTION 6) contains the full source of `rlm_query`. The agent reads its own recursion machinery. When it modifies `rlm_query`, it's modifying itself.
3. **Bounded recursion** — 5 guardrails (depth, PATH scrubbing, call count, budget, timeout) guarantee termination. The system prompt adds *cognitive* pressure: deeper agents prefer direct action.
4. **Symbolic access** — Anything the agent needs to manipulate precisely is a file, not just tokens in context. `$CONTEXT` for data, `$RLM_PROMPT_FILE` for the original prompt, hashline for edits. Agents grep/sed/cat instead of copying tokens from memory. (T14d)

**Don't write static architecture docs.** Encode claims as tests. If a property matters, there should be an E2E test that breaks when it stops being true.

## Sibling Repos (Reference Implementations)

These repos have features we've ported to bash. Read them for design patterns.

### rlm-cli (`/home/raw/Documents/GitHub/rlm-cli`)
Python CLI wrapping the RLM library. Has:
- **Budget tracking**: `max_budget` with cumulative cost, propagates `remaining_budget` to children
- **Timeout**: `max_timeout` with wall-clock tracking, propagates `remaining_timeout`
- **Max tokens**: `max_tokens` with aggregate tracking across iterations
- **Max errors**: `max_errors` — consecutive error threshold
- **Model routing**: `other_backends` — use a different (cheaper) model for sub-calls
- **Graceful exit**: SIGUSR1 handler, returns `_best_partial_answer`
- **Structured errors**: `CliError` hierarchy with `why`, `fix`, `try_steps`
- **Execution summary**: Per-depth stats (calls, cost, duration)

Key files: `rlm/rlm/core/rlm.py` (budget/timeout/subcall logic),
`src/rlm_cli/rlm_adapter.py` (error handling), `src/rlm_cli/live_tree.py`

## Development Workflow

### Before ANY change to rlm_query:
```bash
make test-unit          # Must pass — this is your safety net
```

### After each feature:
```bash
make test-fast          # unit + guardrails (seconds, free)
make test-e2e           # real LLM calls (minutes, costs money)
```

### Before pushing to GitHub:
```bash
make pre-push-checks       # same gate used by CI
```

For release/upstream work, use one command:
```bash
make release-preflight
make land
```
Install local hooks once per clone:
```bash
make install-hooks
```
This sets `core.hooksPath=.githooks` so `pre-push` runs automatically.

CI helpers:
```bash
make ci-status N=15
make ci-last-failure
```

### The recursive test:
After modifying rlm_query, verify YOU still work:
```bash
echo "2+2=" | rlm_query "What is the answer? Just the number."
# Should return: 4
```

If that breaks, you broke yourself. Revert.

### Running experiments and evals
**NEVER block the main conversation waiting for a script to finish.**
- Launch in tmux with a sentinel: `tmux send-keys -t eval:name 'command; echo done > /tmp/ypi-signal-name' Enter`
- The `notify-done` extension wakes you automatically — do NOT `sleep`/poll/`capture-pane` in a loop
- Use `uv run` for Python scripts that need dependencies
- Run A/B conditions **concurrently** in separate tmux windows, not sequentially

### Self-experimentation
You are ypi. When you're unsure whether a feature helps or hurts, **test it on yourself.** Write a small A/B experiment in `experiments/`, run both conditions with `rlm_query`, and measure. Negative results are results — don't keep features out of sunk-cost loyalty. See `.prose/self-experiment.prose` for the workflow.

### Reading session history
Use `rlm_sessions` to inspect what you or other agents have done:
```bash
rlm_sessions                     # List all sessions for this project
rlm_sessions --trace             # List only sessions from current recursive tree
rlm_sessions read --last         # Read most recent session transcript
rlm_sessions read <filename>     # Read a specific session
rlm_sessions grep "pattern"      # Search across all sessions
rlm_sessions grep -t "pattern"   # Search only current trace
```

Common patterns:
```bash
# What is a background ypi doing right now?
rlm_sessions read --last | tail -20

# What did a sub-agent find?
rlm_sessions --trace
rlm_sessions read <trace-file> | tail -20

# Did any previous agent work on X?
rlm_sessions grep "feature-name"
```

Set `RLM_SHARED_SESSIONS=0` to disable session sharing (full isolation).

### Starting a feature branch:
```bash
jj new -m "feat: description of the feature"
jj bookmark create feature-name   # optional, for pushing to GitHub
# ... do work ...
jj describe -m "feat: final description"
jj bookmark set master             # when ready to land
jj git push
```

## Editing rlm_query Safely

`rlm_query` is a live dependency of your own execution. Modifying it mid-session
is like performing surgery on your own brain.

**Safe pattern:**
1. Copy: `cp rlm_query rlm_query.bak`
2. Edit: make changes to `rlm_query`
3. Test: `make test-unit` (uses mock pi, safe)
4. Smoke: `echo "test" | rlm_query "Echo this back"` (real call, verifies you still work)
5. If broken: `cp rlm_query.bak rlm_query`

**Never** modify `rlm_query` and `SYSTEM_PROMPT.md` in the same commit without
testing between changes. One variable at a time.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `CONTEXT` | Path to context file on disk | (required for QA) |
| `RLM_DEPTH` | Current recursion depth | `0` |
| `RLM_MAX_DEPTH` | Maximum recursion depth | `3` |
| `RLM_PROVIDER` | LLM provider for sub-calls | Pi's default |
| `RLM_MODEL` | LLM model for sub-calls | Pi's default |
| `RLM_SYSTEM_PROMPT` | Path to system prompt file | (required) |
| `PI_TRACE_FILE` | Trace log path | (none) |
| `RLM_TIMEOUT` | Max wall-clock seconds | (none = unlimited) |
| `RLM_START_TIME` | Epoch timestamp of root call | (auto-set) |
| `RLM_MAX_CALLS` | Max total rlm_query invocations | (none = unlimited) |
| `RLM_CALL_COUNT` | Running count of calls so far | `0` |
| `RLM_CHILD_MODEL` | Model override for depth > 0 | (none = same as parent) |
| `RLM_CHILD_PROVIDER` | Provider override for depth > 0 | (none = same as parent) |
| `RLM_JJ` | Enable jj workspace isolation | `1` (set `0` to disable) |
| `RLM_SHARED_SESSIONS` | Allow agents to read sibling/parent session logs | `1` (set `0` to disable) |

## Bugs We've Found (and must not re-introduce)

### 1. False stdin detection in CI (`[ -p /dev/stdin ]` can be true with empty input)
**Symptom**: Context is empty in sub-calls (T2/T4 failures in GitHub Actions).
**Cause**: Some CI shells expose stdin as a pipe inside `$(...)` even when nothing is piped.
`cat > "$CHILD_CONTEXT"` reads empty stdin and overwrites inherited context.
**Fix**: Prefer explicit `RLM_STDIN`; when pipe-read is empty and `RLM_STDIN` is unset,
fall back to inherited `CONTEXT`.
**Test**: T2/T4 (inherit), T3 (real pipe), CI run parity via `scripts/pre-push-checks`.

### 2. System prompt as shell arg vs file path
**Symptom**: Shell escaping nightmares, ARG_MAX errors.
**Cause**: `cat`-ing the system prompt into a shell variable.
**Fix**: Pass the file path; Pi's `resolvePromptInput()` reads it.
**Test**: T8, T9 verify file path passing.

### 3. System prompt too aggressive about recursion
**Symptom**: Model calls rlm_query on 11-line contexts, creating infinite chains.
**Fix**: "Check context size first, read directly if small."
**Test**: E1 (small context, should answer directly without sub-calls).

### Secrets & Encryption
Files in `private/`, `experiments/`, `.prose/runs/`, and `.prose/agents/` are encrypted with
[sops](https://github.com/getsops/sops) + [age](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age)
before push. They live **plaintext on disk** so agents and editors can read them.

```bash
# Before pushing (MANDATORY)
scripts/encrypt-prose
jj git push

# After cloning or pulling
scripts/decrypt-prose

# Check if anything needs encrypting
scripts/encrypt-prose --check
```

**Never push without encrypting first.** The `.githooks/pre-commit` blocks
unencrypted files if someone uses git directly, but jj bypasses git hooks.

### OpenProse Programs

`.prose/*.prose` files are public workflow programs committed in plaintext.
Execution state (`.prose/runs/`, `.prose/agents/`) is private — encrypt before push.

```bash
# Run a prose program
rp pi .prose/check-upstream.prose

# Or via the bash script directly
scripts/check-upstream
```
