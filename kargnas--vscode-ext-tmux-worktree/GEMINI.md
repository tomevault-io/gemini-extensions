# AI Agent Guidelines

This document serves as the primary rule file for AI Agents working on this project.
**ALWAYS** update this file when you discover new patterns or finish significant tasks.

## Instruction
- After every task and changes, install the compiled extension to `code`, `code-insiders`, `antigravity`. DO NOT INCREASE version. (It will be automatically increased when publish, and we don't want to increase it for testing)

## Tested VS Code
- `code` (VS Code)
- `antigravity` (Google Antigraity)
- `cursor` (Cursor)

## 1. Codebase Understanding

### Key Components
- **VS Code Extension**: Manages the "TMUX Worktrees" view in the Activity Bar. It interacts with the `tmux` CLI and `git worktree` commands.
- **CLI (`twt`)**: A terminal user interface (TUI) for managing sessions/worktrees outside of VS Code, built with Bubble Tea.

## 2. Coding Patterns & Best Practices

- **Polymorphism**: Commands must handle `TmuxItem` base class and variants (`TmuxSessionItem`, `InactiveWorktreeItem`, etc.).
- **Path Handling**: Use `getWorktreePath(item)` helper.
- **Canonical Path Matching**: For path equality/deduplication/current-workspace checks, normalize to absolute paths with `~` expansion before comparison (do not collapse symlink aliases via `realpath`).
- **Managed Worktree Location**: Create extension-managed worktrees under `~/.tmux-worktrees/<repo-name-hash>/` by default. Reuse shared helpers for path checks and orphan cleanup instead of hardcoding repo-local `.worktrees` path fragments.
- **Session Namespace**: Build tmux session prefixes from repo-root identity (basename + short path hash), not display repo name alone, to avoid collisions across same-name repositories in different directories.
- **Legacy Session Compatibility Isolation**: Keep legacy session-prefix compatibility logic centralized in `src/utils/sessionCompatibility.ts`; call helpers from commands/providers instead of duplicating fallback checks.
- **Root Detection**: Determine the primary worktree by comparing worktree path to the primary worktree path derived from `git rev-parse --git-common-dir`, not by branch naming, folder basename, or the current workspace folder.
- **Current Workspace Indicator**: Highlight the active VS Code workspace by comparing worktree/session paths against the current workspace folder (not the primary worktree path). Current items should sort to the top and display a `👆` marker in the label.
- **External Worktrees**: If the worktree folder name matches the repo name, derive a unique slug/label from the parent directory.
- **Slug Collision Handling**: Worktree session slugs must be unique by sanitized tmux name. Start with basename-based slug, then disambiguate with parent directory, and finally append a short path hash when collisions remain.
- **Free-Form Task Branches**: `TMUX: New Task` accepts arbitrary valid git branch names, including `/`. Sanitize `/` to `-` for tmux/worktree slugs, and never infer main-vs-task state from a `task/` prefix.
- **Unpublished Task Branches**: When creating a new task branch, do not preconfigure `branch.<name>.remote` / `branch.<name>.merge` before the first push. VS Code SCM treats that as an upstream and may try to sync against a remote branch that does not exist yet. Store only `branch.<name>.vscode-merge-base` with the chosen base branch so SCM diffs stay anchored while **Publish Branch** remains available.
- **Primary `main` Slug Reservation**: Reserve `main` for the primary worktree. If a non-primary worktree or branch would sanitize to `main`, suffix it during slug collision resolution instead of reusing the primary session name.
- **Tree Context Menu**: Use a single TreeItem `contextValue` (`tmuxItem`) for levels 2/3/4 so the same context menu always appears.
- **Error Handling**: Use `try-catch` in TS and check `err != nil` in Go. Fail gracefully and notify the user.
- **Async/Await**: Use `async/await` for all I/O operations in TypeScript.
- **Terminal Creation**: Use `/bin/sh -c 'exec tmux attach ...'` instead of `shellPath: 'tmux'`. Direct `shellPath: 'tmux'` causes VS Code to treat it as a non-standard shell, breaking mouse drag events (pane resize). The `exec` replaces sh with tmux (no extra process), and `-c` avoids sendText race conditions with other extensions.
- **Zellij Keybindings**: Keep Zellij default Alt pass-through shortcuts and console Shift+Enter passthrough as static `package.json` keybinding contributions scoped to `terminalFocus && config.tmuxWorktree.multiplexer == 'zellij'`. Apply VS Code terminal setting overrides from `src/utils/zellijTerminalSettings.ts` only while the Zellij backend is active, then restore extension-applied global values when switching away.
- **No-Git Workspace Labeling**: If the workspace is not a git worktree, the tree must still show one primary item labeled `current project (no git)` mapped to the current workspace path.

## 3. Documentation & Development

### Frameworks & Libraries
- **VS Code Extension**: TypeScript, VS Code API.
- **CLI**: Go, Bubble Tea, Lipgloss.

### Local Development
- **Prerequisites**: Node.js, Go, `tmux`, `git`.
- **Setup**:
  ```bash
  npm install
  cd cli && go mod download
  ```
- **Run Extension**: Press F5 in VS Code.
- **Run CLI**: `cd cli && go run ./main.go`.

### Testing
- **Extension**: `npm run lint` (ESLint), `npm run compile`.
- **CLI**: `cd cli && go vet ./...`, `staticcheck ./...`.

### Documentation Sync
- Whenever adding or changing user-visible features (commands, keybindings, tree labels, attach behavior), update `README.md` and `docs/README.ko.md` in the same task.

## 4. Code Quality

### Code Quality: Always look back your git status and make sure build success before commit
- Before you commit to the git, or after you finish a task, you must follow the guidelines below:
- You need to watch the `git status`, and make sure if there is no more unnecessary code, and see if strictly followed my prompts. Change your persona as critical code-reviewer, and blame code if there is some code that doesn't need. Then tell to the user which code is unnecessary and removable at the summary.
- ALWAYS write human-readable code which is easy to understand and maintain even after a year when you look back. You can use any method to achieve this, such as using descriptive variable names, commenting your code, and writing modular code.
- You can easily delete code, functions or files if you are sure that it is not needed anymore. We have git, so you never need to worry about losing code.
- Make sure run and build success
- For javascript or typescript edits, you must ALWAYS run `npm run compile` (or `bun run compile`) to make sure there is no error when build. If you find an error, you must fix it and run build again.
- For tests, you must run `npm run lint` (or relevant test command) to make sure there is no error when test. If you find an error, you must fix it and run test again.
- For smoke tests, you must run the smoke test you edited/added and make sure it's successfully passed. (Fix it if you find an error) But if you don't have any environment variables to run, just STOP working.

## 5. Language & UI/UX
- **Language**: English (Comments, Docs, UI Strings).
- **UI/UX Guidelines**:
  - **Session Presentation**: Two-line layout (Group/Status + Detail).
  - **Terminal Interaction**: Open in Editor Area (Tabs) by default.
  - **Root Labeling**: Do not show a `(root)` label; show the branch/HEAD label for the primary worktree like any other.
  - **Tree Levels**: Level 2 is branch/HEAD with a green circle status (filled = tmux active, outline = stopped, warning = git missing). Level 3 shows tmux usage with `resources/tmux.svg` (inactive uses a grey variant). Level 4 shows git summary (↑ commits, `M/U/D` counts) only when there is something to show.
  - **Deduplication**: Active Session > Inactive Worktree.

## 6. Maintenance
- **Update this file**: When new rules are established or architecture changes.
- **Commit Rules**: Descriptive messages, conventionally formatted.

### Terminal Creation with Tmux
- **PTY Configuration Issue**: Using `shellPath: 'tmux'` causes VS Code to treat tmux as a non-standard shell, resulting in different PTY settings and broken mouse drag events (pane resize fails)
- **Race Condition with Other Extensions**: Using `terminal.sendText('exec tmux attach ...')` causes race conditions with other extensions (e.g., VS Code Python extension) that send commands first, swallowing the `exec` command
- **Shell Integration Interference**: VS Code shell integration environment variables (`VSCODE_SHELL_INTEGRATION`, `VSCODE_INJECTION`) inherited by tmux internal shell cause OSC 633 sequences that add command decorations, blocking mouse drag text selection in interactive panes
- **Tmux Server Environment Pollution**: `tmux show-environment -g` can retain `VSCODE_*` and `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE` from the VS Code extension host. Even if the attach client env is clean, new panes/windows can still inherit those stored values and re-enable shell integration markers intermittently.
- **Zellij Session Environment Pollution**: Detached `zellij attach -b` launched from the extension host can also inherit `VSCODE_*`, `TERM_PROGRAM*`, and `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE`. Strip those vars both when spawning Zellij commands and when creating the bootstrap `/bin/sh` terminal, or prompt redraw/backspace editing can leave stale characters in the integrated terminal.
- **Zellij Detached Session TERM Trap**: A background-created Zellij session (`zellij attach -b`) can start its first shell pane with `TERM=dumb` if no terminal type is seeded during creation. That stale pane environment survives later GUI attaches and causes broken prompt redraw/backspace editing. Always create detached Zellij sessions with an explicit terminal type (eg. `TERM=xterm-256color`) and prefer `simplified-ui true` for VS Code terminals that may not have Nerd Font glyph coverage.
- **Solution**: Use `/bin/sh -c 'exec tmux attach -t ...'` with environment variables set to `null` for shell integration
  - `exec` replaces sh with tmux (no extra process)
  - `-c` executes immediately, avoiding sendText race conditions
  - Setting `TERM_PROGRAM`, `TERM_PROGRAM_VERSION`, `VSCODE_SHELL_INTEGRATION`, and `VSCODE_INJECTION` to `null` prevents shell integration from interfering with tmux internal shells
  - Scrub stored `VSCODE_*` / `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE` from tmux before `new-session` and right before `attach`, otherwise long-lived tmux servers can keep poisoning later panes
- **Remote Clipboard Reliability**: Before attach, set tmux clipboard options (`set-clipboard on`, `terminal-features ...:clipboard`, and `terminal-overrides ...:clipboard`) quietly so copy-mode selections can propagate to the local clipboard via OSC52 in Remote-SSH/VS Code terminals.
- **OpenCode Clipboard in tmux**: OpenCode TUI emits OSC52 via tmux passthrough wrapper (`ESC Ptmux; ... ESC \\`). Ensure `allow-passthrough on` (window option) is enabled, or OpenCode may show "Copied to clipboard" while local clipboard remains unchanged.
- **Startup Size Race Mitigation**: When auto-attaching on extension startup, delay initial attach briefly (for workbench layout stabilization) and stagger multiple attaches. Right before `exec tmux attach`, sync session `default-size` from current PTY (`stty size`) and add a short sleep to avoid initial 80x24-sized clients that only fix after a manual VS Code window resize.
- **Current Window Size Enforcement**: `default-size` alone may not resize an already-existing current window. Before attach, also run `tmux resize-window -t <session>:. -x <cols> -y <rows>` after a short PTY-size retry loop so full-screen TUIs (e.g. OpenCode) do not render in a small centered area until a manual resize.
- **Avoid Persistent Manual Window Size**: `tmux resize-window` flips that window to `window-size manual`, which can leave later attaches clipped even with one client. After forced resize, always restore `window-size latest` (and when reusing an existing terminal, also restore it defensively).
- **Shell Script Assembly Safety**: When composing `/bin/sh -c` scripts that include control structures (`for/do/done`, `if/then/fi`), join command fragments with newlines instead of `; ` to avoid generating invalid tokens like `do;` and causing immediate attach launch failures.
