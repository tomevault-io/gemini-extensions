This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

A cryptocurrency grid trading bot supporting backtesting, paper trading, and live trading. Uses CCXT for exchange integration, with an event-driven architecture and strategy pattern for extensibility. Python 3.12+, managed with `uv`. Packaged as a src layout (`src/grid_trading_bot/`) and installable via `pip install grid_trading_bot`.

## Common Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
uv sync --all-extras --dev

# Run the bot (backtest mode by default via config)
uv run grid_trading_bot run --config config/config.json

# Alternative: run via python -m
uv run python -m grid_trading_bot run --config config/config.json

# Show version
uv run grid_trading_bot --version

# Run all tests with coverage (unit + integration, excludes sandbox)
uv run python -m pytest --cov=grid_trading_bot --cov-report=term

# Run a single test file
uv run python -m pytest tests/order_handling/test_order_manager.py

# Run a single test
uv run python -m pytest tests/order_handling/test_order_manager.py::TestClassName::test_method_name

# Integration tests (backtest E2E, no network needed)
uv run python -m pytest tests/integration/test_backtest_e2e.py -v

# Sandbox smoke tests (requires network, validates ccxt/aiohttp compatibility)
uv run python -m pytest -m sandbox -v

# Update snapshots after intentional behavior changes
uv run python -m pytest tests/integration/test_backtest_e2e.py --update-snapshots

# Lint and format (via pre-commit or directly)

uv run ruff format .

# Run pre-commit hooks
uv run pre-commit run --all-files

# Start monitoring stack (Grafana/Loki/Alloy)
docker-compose up -d
```

## Architecture

### Package Layout

The project uses a **src layout**: all source code lives under `src/grid_trading_bot/`. Tests stay at the repo root under `tests/`. Runtime config files are in `config/`.

### Entry Point

`cli.py` is the Click-based CLI entry point (registered as `grid_trading_bot` console script). It parses CLI args via the `run` subcommand, creates a `GridTradingBot` per config file, and runs them concurrently via `asyncio.gather`. In live/paper mode, `BotController` (CLI commands) and `HealthCheck` (system monitoring) run as concurrent tasks. Supports `python -m grid_trading_bot` via `__main__.py`.

### Core Modules

- **`core/bot_management/`** — Bot lifecycle: `GridTradingBot` (orchestrator), `EventBus` (pub/sub), `BotController` (CLI), `HealthCheck`, `NotificationHandler` (Apprise alerts)
- **`core/grid_management/`** — `GridManager` computes grid levels (arithmetic/geometric spacing), `GridLevel` is a state machine tracking each level's cycle (`READY_TO_BUY` → `WAITING_FOR_BUY_FILL` → `READY_TO_SELL` → etc.)
- **`core/order_handling/`** — `OrderManager` orchestrates order placement and pairing (buy fill → place sell above, sell fill → place buy below). `BalanceTracker` tracks fiat/crypto with reserved amounts. `OrderBook` maps orders to grid levels
- **`core/persistence/`** — SQLite state persistence (live mode only): `StatePersistenceService` (event-driven checkpoints on every order fill/cancel), `StateRecoveryService` (merge recovery on restart — loads DB state, reconciles with exchange, restores balances), `SQLiteStateRepository` (WAL-mode SQLite backend), `Serializers` (Order/GridLevel/Balance ↔ dict). DB path: `data/{BASE}_{QUOTE}/state_{config_hash[:8]}.db`
- **`core/services/`** — Exchange abstraction via `ExchangeInterface` ABC. `BacktestExchangeService` reads CSV/CCXT OHLCV data. `LiveExchangeService` uses CCXT Pro WebSockets
- **`core/order_handling/execution_strategy/`** — `OrderExecutionStrategyInterface` ABC. Backtest variant is instant; live variant has retry logic with exponential backoff and slippage handling
- **`core/validation/`** — `OrderValidator` for order quantity/price validation

### Strategy Layer

- **`strategies/grid_trading_strategy.py`** — Implements `TradingStrategyInterface`. Handles both backtest (iterate OHLCV rows) and live (WebSocket price stream) execution loops. Manages initial purchase (50% allocation), grid order initialization, take-profit/stop-loss
- **`strategies/trading_performance_analyzer.py`** — Computes ROI, max drawdown, Sharpe ratio, etc.
- **`strategies/plotter.py`** — Plotly visualization for backtest results

### Config & Utils

- **`config/`** — `ConfigManager` (accessor methods for nested JSON), `ConfigValidator` (schema validation), `TradingMode` enum, custom `ConfigError` exceptions
- **`utils/`** — Logging setup, config name generation, performance results I/O

### Key Design Patterns

- **Factory Pattern**: `ExchangeServiceFactory` and `OrderExecutionStrategyFactory` select implementations based on `TradingMode`
- **Event Bus**: Decoupled communication via events (`ORDER_FILLED`, `ORDER_CANCELLED`, `START_BOT`, `STOP_BOT`, `INITIAL_PURCHASE_DONE`, `GRID_ORDERS_INITIALIZED`). Components subscribe to events rather than calling each other directly
- **State Machine**: `GridLevel` transitions through `GridCycleState` enum states as orders are placed and filled
- **Strategy Pattern**: `TradingStrategyInterface` ABC; currently one implementation (`GridTradingStrategy`) with two modes (`simple_grid`, `hedged_grid`)

### Trading Modes

Configured via `exchange.trading_mode` in `config.json`:
- **`backtest`**: Simulates on historical OHLCV data (CSV or fetched via CCXT). No real orders
- **`paper_trading`**: Connects to exchange sandbox APIs with real market data. Runs BotController + HealthCheck
- **`live`**: Real trading with actual funds. Same architecture as paper trading but against production APIs. Includes SQLite state persistence for crash recovery (automatic checkpoint on every order event, merge recovery on restart)

## Testing

Tests mirror the source structure under `tests/`. Async tests use `pytest-asyncio` with `asyncio_mode = "auto"`. The `conftest.py` provides a `valid_config` fixture with a complete config dict. Coverage excludes interface files (`*/interface*.py`).

All imports use the full package path: `from grid_trading_bot.config.X import Y`. The `pythonpath = ["src"]` setting in `pyproject.toml` allows pytest to resolve these imports.

### Unit Tests

Located in `tests/` (excluding `tests/integration/`). Heavy use of mocking to isolate components.

### Integration Tests

Located in `tests/integration/`. **Zero mocks** — the full bot stack runs against real CSV data.

- **`test_backtest_e2e.py`** — 16 parametrized tests covering 4 scenarios (simple_grid/hedged_grid x arithmetic/geometric). Validates: no crash, balance coherence, grid cycle integrity, and deterministic results via snapshot comparison.
- **`test_sandbox_smoke.py`** — 3 tests that make real network calls to Binance public API (REST + WebSocket). Validates ccxt/aiohttp compatibility. Marked `@pytest.mark.sandbox` and excluded from default runs.
- **`snapshots/`** — JSON reference files for deterministic result comparison. Update with `--update-snapshots` flag after intentional behavior changes.

### Pytest Markers

- `integration` — E2E backtest tests
- `sandbox` — Tests requiring network access (excluded by default via `addopts`)

## Documentation

The project uses [Zensical](https://github.com/nicholasgriffintn/zensical) (Material for MkDocs successor) for web documentation, hosted on GitHub Pages.

- **Config**: `zensical.toml` at repo root
- **Source files**: `docs/` directory (Markdown + Mermaid diagrams)
- **Build output**: `site/` (gitignored)

```bash
# Preview locally
uv sync --extra docs && uv run zensical serve

# Build static site
uv run zensical build --clean
```

Deploy is automatic via GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/docs.yml`) on push to `master`.

## Linting & Formatting

Ruff is configured in `pyproject.toml` with 120-char line length, targeting Python 3.12. Pre-commit hooks run Ruff lint+format, plus checks for trailing whitespace, valid YAML/JSON/TOML, merge conflicts, debug statements, blanket `noqa`/`type: ignore`, and deprecated `log.warn()`.
