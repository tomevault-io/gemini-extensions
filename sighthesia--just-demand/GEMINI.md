# Just Demand

OpenCode-first local agent workflow runtime: Python scripts own workflow state, OpenCode plugins inject lightweight guardrails/context, and `.opencode/skills/` hold the detailed workflow rules.

Canonical workflow specification: `docs/workflow-spec.md` — the authoritative reference for lifecycle, role model, product philosophy, and user-expectation contract. When this file or any skill diverges from the spec, the spec is the reference.


## Just Demand Workflow Philosophy

Just Demand is a workflow runtime, not a one-shot prompt bundle.

### Core Interaction Contract

- **Effect first**: lead every reply with the user-visible result or conclusion, not implementation detail.
- **Defaults first**: recommend a path before asking; options only when the choice affects visible behavior, architecture, compatibility, security, cost, or maintenance.
- **Clarify before execute**: no code edits or subagent dispatch until the final expected effect, chosen approach, and plan are explicitly approved.
- **Subagents are selective accelerators**: dispatch only when all six eligibility gates and all three net-benefit questions pass. The main agent may execute any work — including long-context, multi-file, or multi-step work — when an answer fails or is uncertain. Small reads/edits (~几十行) and script-verifiable checks also stay in the main session.
- **Closeout is a real step**: verification closeout via `complete-verification` is required; completion wording does not replace it.

### Guiding Principle

The system is designed to keep durable workflow truth in explicit state and scripts, while keeping prompt-layer guidance light, readable, and role-specific.

```text
user goal
  -> clarify
  -> intake
  -> promote
  -> context
  -> execute directly or dispatch selectively
  -> verify
  -> complete-verification
  -> archive
```

### Identity Model

- **User**: boss, product manager, and architecture approver.
- **Main agent**: workflow owner, delivery lead, researcher, architect, and implementer.
- **Optional subagent team**: tester and advisor.

The user defines goals, constraints, and final approval. The main agent owns workflow shape, routing, and closure. Subagents execute focused role contracts inside the task boundary.

### Main Agent Output Style

The main agent should optimize for low cognitive load:

- **Effect first**: lead with the user-visible result.
- **Defaults first**: mention the recommended path before alternatives.
- **Options only when needed**: present tradeoffs when the choice changes behavior, compatibility, cost, security, or long-term maintenance.
- **Implementation details last**: mention files and mechanics only when they help the decision or verification.

### Control Layers And Why They Exist

```text
docs / AGENTS / README
    -> explain the philosophy and roles

skills
    -> route the main agent and clarify intake/execution/verification habits

plugins
    -> inject lightweight runtime state, execution gates, and subagent context

CLI + .just-demand state
    -> durable source of truth for task lifecycle and archive history
```

This layered model exists because pure one-time injection fades after the first turn, and pure prompt-only control is too soft for durable task lifecycle and gatekeeping. The runtime needs persistent state, explicit promotion, and structured handoff between roles.

### What Each Layer Is For

- **Skills**: encode the main-agent identity, routing, clarification, intake, execution, verification, and lesson-capture habits.
- **Plugins**: inject the current workflow state, enforce execution gates, and attach the right task context to subagents.
- **CLI / `.just-demand/` state**: provide the durable lifecycle source of truth for active tasks, archives, and workflow transitions.
- **Task context files**: give each subagent the scoped facts it needs without re-reading the whole workspace.

### Main-Agent Identity Sources

The main agent’s working identity is reinforced from several places at once:

1. `AGENTS.md`
2. `using-just-demand`
3. the workflow-state plugin banner / guardrails
4. the current task context files
5. subagent prompts, for subagents only

These sources agree on the same role model so the main agent stays a dispatcher and workflow owner rather than drifting into an ad hoc helper.

### Subagent Inner Loops

Subagents are not miniature workflow owners. Their inner loops are role-specific execution contracts:

- **tester**: verify the task against acceptance criteria.
- **advisor**: frame hard decisions and cross-boundary tradeoffs.

Compatibility-only `researcher` and `coder` definitions remain available for legacy tasks that already record those roles or when the user explicitly requests one. New tasks never route to them implicitly.

They do not independently create, promote, close, or re-route tasks. That keeps lifecycle ownership centralized and prevents role drift.

### Workflow Lifecycle And Handoff Shape

```text
clarify
  -> intake
  -> promote
  -> context
  -> dispatch
  -> verify
  -> complete-verification
  -> archive
```

Each step exists to reduce ambiguity before work starts, keep the active task explicit, and make closure durable enough to survive future sessions.

### Why Not One-Time Injection Or Prompt-Only Control

- **One-time injection** is easy to forget, easy to drift from, and weak across long sessions.
- **Prompt-only control** cannot reliably enforce gates, task state, or archival discipline.
- **Persistent runtime state** plus **lightweight prompt guidance** gives the best balance of durability, clarity, and operability.

### Scannable Mental Model

```text
human intent
  -> workflow policy
  -> state transition
  -> role-specific execution
  -> verification
  -> archived task history
```

Think of Just Demand as an operating system for agent work: the docs explain the model, skills teach the habits, plugins enforce the current frame, and the CLI/state layer records what actually happened.

## Workflow Model

- Treat this repo as a workflow runtime, not a normal app. The primary behavior is the lifecycle around `.just-demand/` state, plugin guardrails, and `just-demand-*` subagents.
- Working flow: clarify -> intake -> promote to formal task -> inspect unfinished tasks -> execute in the main session or selectively dispatch -> verify -> `complete-verification` -> checkpoint commit -> archive.
- Do not skip the clarification gate. In this repo, `using-just-demand` routes first and `socratic-clarification` is the hard gate before promotion, subagent dispatch, or code edits.
- Main-agent default: lead with the likely effect and the recommended option first, then ask only for the decision that would change visible behavior, architecture, compatibility, security, cost, or long-term maintainability.
- Subagent dispatch requires all six hard gates and all three benefit questions to pass. The main agent executes any work when an answer fails or is uncertain. Fast models are limited to mechanical tasks; frontend visual/interaction/copy quality stays with the main agent by default.
- The user is the boss/product lead/architecture approver; the main agent owns workflow dispatch, verification, and closure.
- Subagent inner loops are execution contracts, not autonomous lifecycle owners: tester verifies and advisor advises within scope, but neither creates, promotes, closes, or re-routes tasks.

## Skill-Only Fallback

- If OpenCode plugins are unavailable, disabled, or unstable, skill guidance is only best-effort; it cannot hard-block tools. Plugin gates remain the reliable enforcement layer.
- Even without plugin support, every repo-work turn must start by loading `using-just-demand` when workflow rules might apply.
- Any request, bug, correction, design/refactor, implementation approval, or Q&A-to-work pivot must then load `socratic-clarification` before intake, execution, or code edits.
- Treat user approval of an approach as approval to enter intake/formal task flow, not permission to edit inline unless formal execution readiness is satisfied.
- Before promotion, bounded read-only discovery is allowed when needed to translate a user's need or phenomenon into evidence-backed change surfaces. Keep it relevant and side-effect free; writes, behavior changes, side-effecting commands, execution subagents, and broad unrelated exploration still wait for a formal task.
- Before any write tool or execution subagent in no-plugin fallback mode, run `just-demand . list-active` and verify the required task context files exist.

## Source Of Truth

- Trust executable behavior over prose: the `just-demand` CLI, `.just-demand/scripts/workflow_core.py`, and `.opencode/plugins/*.js` are the real workflow spec.
- Do not hand-edit `.just-demand/state/state.json`, `locks.json`, or `events.jsonl`; change workflow state only through the `just-demand` CLI.
- Main-session plugins should stay lightweight. `just-demand-state.js` should not inject a task-state dump; task inspection is explicit via `list-active`.

## Required Commands

- Core tests: `python3 -m unittest tests.just_demand.test_workflow_core -v`
- Install tests: `python3 -m unittest tests.just_demand.test_install -v`
- Plugin tests: `node --test tests/just_demand/test_opencode_plugins.mjs`
- Validate Node package file: `python3 -m json.tool .opencode/package.json`
- List unfinished formal tasks before execution: `just-demand . list-active`
- Select or resume a task: `just-demand . select-task <task-id>` or `just-demand . resume <task-id>`
- Create intake: `just-demand . create-intake "<title>" "<raw request>" --session <session-id>`
- Promote intake: `just-demand . promote <intake-id> "<title>" "<goal>" --type design --acceptance "<criterion>"`
- Root help: `just-demand --help` or `just-demand . --help`
- Mark task status/progress/impact: `just-demand . mark <task-id> <status> [--progress N] [--impact PATH] [--note TEXT]`
- Close verified work: `just-demand . complete-verification <task-id> passed "<summary>"`
- Mid-task checkpoint: `just-demand . checkpoint-commit <task-id>`

## Command Order That Matters

- After changing `.just-demand/scripts/`, run both Python test modules.
- After changing `.opencode/plugins/`, `.opencode/agent/`, `.opencode/skills/`, or `.opencode/package.json`, run plugin tests and `python3 -m json.tool .opencode/package.json`, then restart OpenCode.
- Before any implementation or verification dispatch, run `list-active` to inspect unfinished tasks for conflict risk.
- `create-intake` only creates an intake. `list-active` stays empty until `promote` creates a formal task.
- Prompt-layer recovery details belong in `just-demand-intake` and `just-demand-execution`; keep AGENTS at the rule/command level.
- After `create-intake`, fill the created intake markdown at `.just-demand/state/intake/<intake-id>.md`; promotion is not the next legal step until the required sections are written there.
- If `promote` fails with missing-field or blocking-question errors, update the same intake file to fill the named sections, clear blocking questions, then rerun `just-demand . promote ...`; do not create a second intake just to recover.
- If `list-active` shows unfinished formal tasks but no current task is selected, recover by choosing the right task with `just-demand . select-task <task-id>` or `just-demand . resume <task-id>` before dispatch or inline edits.
- Do not report a task as complete until `complete-verification` has run. In this repo, verification closeout is a real workflow step, not wording.

## Task Context Rules

- Required files for default optional roles are enforced by plugin injection:
- `just-demand-tester`: `context.md`, `verify.md`
- `just-demand-advisor`: `context.md`
- Compatibility dispatch keeps the historical coder (`context.md`, `implement.md`) and researcher (`context.md`) requirements.
- If required files are missing, stop and create/refresh the task context package; do not silently continue inline.

## Repository Map

- `.just-demand/scripts/`: workflow CLI and state transitions; the only write path for workflow machine state.
- `.just-demand/knowledge/`: legacy workspace knowledge location retained for compatibility and migration only.
- `.just-demand/state/`: runtime state only; includes `intake/`, `active/`, `archive/`, event logs, and locks.
- `.opencode/plugins/`: OpenCode guardrails and task-context injection.
- `.opencode/agent/`: subagent definitions for `just-demand-*` roles.
- `.opencode/skills/`: detailed workflow policy; load these instead of duplicating long rules in chat.
- `tests/just_demand/`: Python coverage for workflow scripts plus Node coverage for plugins.

## Subagent Boundaries

- `just-demand-tester`: verify against the task brief; may fix only low-risk local issues.
- `just-demand-advisor`: independent analysis and advisory for difficult or cross-boundary problems; no direct large-scale implementation.
- `just-demand-researcher` and `just-demand-coder` are compatibility-only: allow them only for tasks that already record the role or when the user explicitly requests it.
- Documentation, decisions, durable notes, research, implementation, and summaries are owned by the main agent. There is no standalone docs subagent.
- If a suitable `just-demand-*` subagent should be used but is unavailable, ask whether to retry now or skip one turn; do not quietly abandon the subagent path.

## Commit And Archive Expectations

- Checkpoint commits are the default after clean verification. Use `complete-verification` for the normal path; it records verification, attempts the checkpoint commit, and archives on pass.
- `impact` on `mark` is recommended because checkpoint commits can scope to task-related paths, but the script will fall back to all non-generated changed files when impact is absent.
- Completed tasks should be archived, not destructively removed first. Task-only history stays in the archive; reusable lessons should be captured as skills.

## OpenCode / Node Gotchas

- There is no root `package.json`; plugin tests run directly with `node --test tests/just_demand/test_opencode_plugins.mjs`.
- `.opencode/package.json` must remain valid JSON and keep `{ "type": "module" }`, or Node will stop loading `.opencode/plugins/*.js`.
- Keep `.opencode/plugins/*.js` as repository-tracked regular files (or another repository-tracked source), not absolute links into `~/.config/opencode/`. Absolute links can make tests exercise global files while checkpoint commits omit the implementation.
