## What Is dreamboard?

**dreamboard** is a personal visual goal-board creator. It combines a marketing landing page and a canvas-based editor where a user can place images and text, style objects, and export the result as a composed dream board.

**Current implementation:** static single-file web app  
**Core editor dependency:** Fabric.js  
**Deploy target:** Vercel via Git integration  
**Owner:** personal project, single user

## Delivery Workflow

- All code changes land through pull requests.
- Product-code work starts from an active `specs/<feature-id>/` folder.
- One implementation loop uses one worktree, one branch, and one PR.
- Required GitHub checks are `baseline-checks`, `guard`, and `AI Review`.
- Vercel handles preview deployments for pull requests and production deployment for `main` through Git integration.
- Durable workflow docs live under `docs_dreamboard/project/devops/`.
- Local orchestration state lives under `.claude/` and is gitignored.
- Local worktrees are created inside `<repoRoot>/.claude/worktrees/<slug>/` so they stay inside the repository.
- Agent selection is policy-driven through repository variables:
  - `AI_IMPLEMENTATION_AGENT`
  - `AI_REVIEW_AGENT`
- Default policy for this repository is:
  - implementation: `claude`
  - review: `codex`
- Claude is the default implementation agent because it owns architecture, orchestration, CI/CD health, and repository memory, and is driven from the user's local Claude Code terminal session.
- Codex is the default review backend because it runs natively on GitHub pull requests and emits `P0`–`P3` inline severity markers.
- Gemini stays available as the fallback review backend when `AI_REVIEW_AGENT=gemini`. Claude review is a third-tier option behind an explicit `AI_REVIEW_AGENT=claude` override and still requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` when used.
- Trusted human review commands still follow the shared `AI Review` contract, but only `claude` uses `workflow_dispatch`; `gemini` and `codex` stay native-only so they do not cancel the PR-linked gate.
- Only trusted repository actors may trigger AI workflows.
- Trusted actors are `OWNER`, `MEMBER`, and `COLLABORATOR`.

## Review Guidelines

- Codex review uses native GitHub PR review output plus `P0-P3` inline severity badges.
- Claude review uses a top-level `claude[bot]` comment with marker lines, not a formal GitHub PR review.
- Gemini review uses native GitHub PR review output from `gemini-code-assist[bot]` plus inline severity markers such as `Critical`, `High`, `Medium`, and `Low`.
- When a Claude review request includes `AI_REVIEW_AGENT`, `AI_REVIEW_SHA`, and `AI_REVIEW_OUTCOME`, preserve those lines exactly at the start of the final top-level Claude comment.
- `AI_REVIEW_OUTCOME=pass` means no material findings.
- `AI_REVIEW_OUTCOME=advisory` means advisory-only findings that should not block merge.
- `AI_REVIEW_OUTCOME=block` means at least one finding should block merge.

## Key Rules

### 1. Repository is the source of truth

No direct production edits in Vercel or the browser. Product changes must be made in git, reviewed in a PR, and deployed from the reviewed branch or merge commit.

### 2. Keep durable docs in sync

When updating `index.html`, `src/`, runtime behavior, workflows, or deploy
configuration, update the active `specs/<feature-id>/` folder and at least one
relevant durable doc under `docs_dreamboard/`, `AGENTS.md`, or `CLAUDE.md`.

### 3. Preserve static-site deployability

Even while the app is still a single-file prototype, changes must keep `pnpm run build` producing a deployable `dist/index.html` artifact for Vercel.

### 4. One worker equals one worktree

Do not run parallel implementation work in the main checkout. Use the local
macOS runner flow from `docs_dreamboard/project/devops/macos-local-runners.md`.

### 5. Gemini review config is repository-owned

Gemini review behavior is configured through `.gemini/config.yaml` and
`.gemini/styleguide.md`. Keep those files in sync with the repository review
contract.

### 6. Frontend changes should improve mobile, not patch around it

Avoid adding more fixed-size offsets and viewport hacks unless strictly necessary. Prefer layout systems that can survive later migration to a modular frontend app.
