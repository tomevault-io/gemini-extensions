# libSDL2-amigaos3 -- Claude Code Project Instructions

## RULE 0: NEVER GUESS -- ALWAYS LOOK IT UP

**This is 30-year-old hardware and libraries. Your training data is NOT sufficient.**

Before writing or fixing ANY code that touches AmigaOS APIs, Exec, devices, or 68k hardware:

1. **Read the documentation first.** Use `amiga_api_lookup`, `amiga_search`, `amiga_pitfalls_for`, or read the ADCD docs in `docs/references/`. Every function, every struct field, every flag has documented behavior that may differ from what you expect.

2. **Search the internet.** Use `WebSearch` for forum posts, existing implementations, and known issues. Check EAB (eab.abime.net), Aminet, and GitHub for reference code.

3. **Never assume how an API works.** CheckIO, WaitIO, BeginIO, SendIO, CreateMsgPort, Signal -- these all have specific documented semantics. A wrong assumption about `ln_Type`, signal delivery, or task context wastes hours.

4. **When debugging, instrument and observe before hypothesizing.** Add debug output (DLOG via `SDL_os3debug.h`), read the actual values, THEN form a theory. Don't guess at the fix -- verify the root cause first.

5. **When stuck after 2 attempts, STOP coding and research.** Read ADCD docs, search forums, check reference implementations (SDL 1.2, OS4 port). The answer is almost always documented somewhere.

**Why this rule exists:** Multiple debugging sessions wasted hours because the agent guessed at AmigaOS behavior instead of reading the documentation. Examples: MsgPort signal delivery (ADCD ch.22), CheckIO return semantics, audio.device CMD_WRITE completion, CreateNewProcTags tc_UserData race. Every one of these is documented in the ADCD.

## What This Project Is

A port of SDL2 (Simple DirectMedia Layer 2) to AmigaOS 3.x on Motorola 68k. This is a **platform library** -- it provides `libSDL2.a` that other programs link against. It is NOT a POSIX port; it implements SDL2's platform abstraction layer using native AmigaOS APIs.

## Architecture

SDL2 has a backend/driver architecture. Each subsystem (video, audio, threading, etc.) has a platform-specific implementation. We provide AmigaOS 3.x backends:

| Subsystem | Backend | AmigaOS API | Source Dir |
|-----------|---------|------------|-----------|
| Video | CyberGraphX / Picasso96 | `WritePixelArray()`, screen modes | `src/video/amigaos3/` |
| Video (AGA) | Custom chipset + c2p | Blitter, bitplanes | `src/video/amigaos3/` (Phase 6) |
| Audio | AHI | `AHI_AllocAudio()`, callbacks | `src/audio/amigaos3/` |
| Threading | Exec Tasks | `CreateNewProc()`, `SignalSemaphore` | `src/thread/amigaos3/` |
| Timer | timer.device | `ReadEClock()` | `src/timer/amigaos3/` |
| Input/Events | Intuition IDCMP | `IDCMP_RAWKEY`, `IDCMP_MOUSEMOVE` | `src/events/` (via video driver) |
| Joystick | gameport.device | `GPD_ASKCTYPE` | `src/joystick/amigaos3/` |
| Filesystem | dos.library | `Lock()`, `Examine()` | `src/filesystem/amigaos3/` |
| Loadso | Stub (no dlopen) | -- | `src/loadso/dummy/` |
| Haptic | Stub | -- | `src/haptic/dummy/` |
| Render | Software (built-in) | -- | `src/render/software/` |

```

## Build Instructions

```bash
make setup-toolchain   # Pull/verify bebbo-gcc Docker image
make                   # Build libSDL2.a (cross-compile via Docker)
make examples          # Build example/test programs
make test              # Run tests via FS-UAE with RTG
make clean             # Remove build artifacts
```

**Prerequisites:** Docker, Python + amitools, FS-UAE with RTG-capable config.

## Compiler Settings

- **Language:** C99 (`-std=gnu99`). SDL2 requires C99.
- **CPU target:** `-m68020` for the library (RTG cards require 68020+).
- **Optimization:** `-O0` initially until backends are proven stable. Upgrade to `-O2` per-file after testing. bebbo-gcc has codegen bugs at `-O1`/`-O2` (see crash pattern #16 via `amiga_crash_diagnosis`).
- **`SDL_DYNAMIC_API`:** Disabled (`#define SDL_DYNAMIC_API 0`). AmigaOS 3.x has no `dlopen()`.

## Coding Standards

### C99 with AmigaOS Constraints

- Use C99 features (for-init, `//` comments, mixed declarations, `inline`).
- Do NOT assume C99 library functions exist -- libnix is a C89 runtime. Check via `amiga_search "libnix [function]"` or `amiga_pitfalls_for "libnix"`.
- Use `<proto/*.h>` for Amiga system calls (never `<clib/*.h>`).
- Use Amiga types (`LONG`, `ULONG`, `STRPTR`, `BPTR`, `APTR`) for OS interfaces.
- Format specifiers: `%ld`/`%lu` for `LONG`/`ULONG` (32-bit `long`).

### ASCII Only in Source

ALL `.c` and `.h` files must be pure ASCII. No UTF-8, not even in comments. bebbo-gcc silently corrupts preprocessor output on multi-byte characters.

### Memory Safety

AmigaOS has no memory protection. Every `malloc()` must have a `free()`. Every `OpenLibrary()` must have a `CloseLibrary()`. Every `OpenDevice()` must have a `CloseDevice()`. Leaked resources persist until reboot.

### Stack Safety

Backend functions called from SDL2's core must not use large local arrays. Keep stack usage under 512 bytes per function. SDL2 programs set their own `__stack` cookie; the library shouldn't blow it.

### Threading Safety

Exec Tasks are cooperative on the same address space. No memory protection between tasks. `SignalSemaphore` is the primitive for mutual exclusion. `Forbid()`/`Permit()` for brief critical sections only. Never hold a semaphore across a `Wait()` call.

## Key References

### Shared Knowledge Base (amiga-kb via MCP)

General Amiga reference docs are in the shared amiga-kb knowledge base. Use MCP tools
instead of reading local files:

**Knowledge Query:**
- `amiga_search` -- semantic search across all Amiga docs (crash patterns, pitfalls, ADCD, hardware)
- `amiga_api_lookup` -- function/struct lookup with graph traversal and pitfall warnings
- `amiga_pitfalls_for` -- known pitfalls for an API or concept
- `amiga_crash_diagnosis` -- crash diagnosis from Guru codes

**Project Intelligence (plans, work, todos):**
- `amiga_get_work` -- **Start every session with this.** Returns current plans, work packages, todos with related pitfalls inline. Call: `amiga_get_work({project: "libSDL2"})`
- `amiga_add_plan` -- Create a plan with work packages and todos. Supports templates: `amiga_add_plan({title: "Audio Backend", source_project: "libSDL2", template: "sdl2-subsystem"})`
- `amiga_add_todo` -- Add a todo linked to a work package and related APIs: `amiga_add_todo({title: "Fix blitter DMA", source_project: "libSDL2", work_package: "Video", related_apis: ["WaitBlit"]})`
- `amiga_update_status` -- Mark work done: `amiga_update_status({type: "todo", title: "Fix blitter DMA", source_project: "libSDL2", status: "done"})`
- `amiga_get_blockers` -- Find blocked work across all projects
- `amiga_add_dependency` -- Link work packages across projects (e.g., SDL2 video depends on amiport mmap shim)

**Learning & Gaps:**
- `amiga_report_gap` -- report missing knowledge (feeds the learning compiler)
- `amiga_add_pitfall` / `amiga_add_crash_pattern` -- route universal learnings to shared KB

The amiga-kb MCP server must be running (`docker compose up -d` in the amiga-kb repo).
All queries from this project are tagged with `source_project: "libSDL2"`.

### Session Workflow

1. **Start:** Call `amiga_get_work({project: "libSDL2"})` to see current plans and outstanding work
2. **Work:** Implement, debug, test
3. **Track:** Use `amiga_update_status` when completing todos, `amiga_add_todo` for new work discovered
4. **Learn:** Use `amiga_add_pitfall` for new gotchas, `amiga_report_gap` for missing docs
5. **End:** Ensure all completed work is marked done

### Critical (project-specific, consult during every backend implementation)

- Crash patterns #7 (stack overflow), #10 (large buffers), #15 (alignment), #16 (struct returns at -O2) all apply. Use `amiga_crash_diagnosis` for lookup.
- 68k hardware reference available via `amiga_search "68k memory map"` etc.
- libnix function availability via `amiga_search "libnix ..."` or `amiga_pitfalls_for "libnix"`.

### AmigaOS API Documentation

- `docs/references/adcd/` -- ADCD 2.1 reference in markdown (also indexed in amiga-kb vectors).
- `docs/references/amiga-intern/` -- "Amiga Intern" (1992). Custom chip architecture, memory map, DMA timing.
- `docs/references/m68000-prm/` -- Motorola M68000 Family Programmer's Reference Manual.

### New References Needed (not yet in docs/)

These are third-party APIs not in the ADCD. Reference docs must be created before implementing their backends:

| API | Backend | Priority |
|-----|---------|----------|
| CyberGraphX V4 | Video | Critical (Phase 1) |
| Picasso96 | Video (alt) | Critical (Phase 1) |
| AHI | Audio | Critical (Phase 3) |

## Agents and Skills -- When to Use What

### Decision Tree

```
"I need to implement a backend"
  -> Dispatch sdl2-backend-developer (opus)
  -> FIRST: ensure reference doc exists (/amiga-api-lookup, /rtg-api-lookup)
  -> FIRST: check SDL2 contract (/sdl2-api-lookup)

"Build failed"
  -> Dispatch build-manager (sonnet)

"Something crashes or hangs on FS-UAE but works on vamos"
  -> Dispatch hardware-expert (opus)

"I need API documentation for a new subsystem"
  -> Dispatch librarian (sonnet)

"Check for memory leaks or resource lifecycle issues"
  -> Dispatch memory-checker (sonnet) AFTER implementation is done

"Optimize for 68k performance"
  -> Dispatch perf-optimizer (sonnet) -- Phase 6 only

"Build the automated test pipeline"
  -> Dispatch test-designer (sonnet)

"Build the project"           -> /sdl2-build
"Run tests"                   -> /sdl2-test
"Look up AmigaOS API"         -> /amiga-api-lookup
"Look up CyberGraphX/P96 API" -> /rtg-api-lookup
"Look up SDL2 backend contract"-> /sdl2-api-lookup
"FS-UAE not working"           -> /fsemu-setup
"Bug or process failure"       -> /capture-learning
```

### Agent Summary

| Agent | Model | When to dispatch |
|-------|-------|-----------------|
| sdl2-backend-developer | opus | Writing C backend code against SDL2 + AmigaOS APIs |
| hardware-expert | opus | Crash diagnosis, platform differences, hardware validation |
| build-manager | sonnet | Compiler/linker errors, build configuration |
| librarian | sonnet | Building reference docs from headers, web, toolchain |
| memory-checker | sonnet | Auditing OpenLibrary/CloseLibrary, malloc/free, resource lifecycle |
| perf-optimizer | sonnet | 68k performance optimization (Phase 6) |
| test-designer | sonnet | Automated test infrastructure, ARexx, FS-UAE automation |

### Skill Summary

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| /amiga-api-lookup | Load ADCD reference before writing AmigaOS API code |
| /rtg-api-lookup | Load CyberGraphX/P96 reference |
| /sdl2-api-lookup | Load SDL2 backend interface contracts |
| /sdl2-build | Cross-compile via Docker |
| /sdl2-test | Run vamos or FS-UAE tests |
| /fsemu-setup | FS-UAE + P96 RTG troubleshooting |
| /capture-learning | Route bugs/pitfalls to the right enforcement mechanism |

### Mandatory Workflow

Before implementing ANY new backend subsystem:
1. `/amiga-api-lookup` or dispatch librarian to build reference doc
2. `/sdl2-api-lookup` to understand the SDL2 contract
3. Dispatch `sdl2-backend-developer` with both references
4. After implementation: dispatch `memory-checker`
5. After tests pass on vamos: test on FS-UAE
6. If FS-UAE fails: dispatch `hardware-expert`
7. After everything works: `/capture-learning` for any surprises

## Phased Delivery

| Phase | Focus | Key Files |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| **0: Bootstrap** | All stubs, `SDL_Init()` returns 0 | All `src/*/amigaos3/*.c` as stubs |
| **1: First Pixels** | CyberGraphX video + software render | `src/video/amigaos3/`, `src/render/software/` |
| **2: Input** | IDCMP -> SDL events | `src/video/amigaos3/SDL_os3events.c` |
| **3: Audio** | AHI backend | `src/audio/amigaos3/` |
| **4: Threading** | Exec Tasks | `src/thread/amigaos3/` |
| **5: Polish** | Timer, filesystem, joystick | Remaining backends |
| **6: Optimization** | AGA c2p, AMMX, asm hotpaths | `src/video/amigaos3/` extensions |

## Phase Gate Rules

Before starting Phase N, confirm Phase N-1 is stable:

| Starting Phase | Prerequisite |
|---------------|-------------|
| **1: First Pixels** | Phase 0 tests pass: `SDL_Init(0)` returns 0, `SDL_Quit()` clean exit |
| **2: Input** | Phase 1 tests pass: window opens on FS-UAE with RTG, `testsprite2` draws pixels |
| **3: Audio** | Phase 2 tests pass: keyboard/mouse events received, `testkeys` reports scancodes |
| **4: Threading** | Phase 3 tests pass: `loopwave` plays audio via AHI |
| **5: Polish** | Phase 4 tests pass: threaded programs work (mutex, semaphore, TLS) |
| **6: Optimization** | Phase 5 tests pass: timer, filesystem, joystick backends functional |

Do not skip phases. If a phase's prerequisite test fails, fix it before moving forward.

## Testing

- **Phase 0-1:** vamos smoke test (`SDL_Init()` / `SDL_Quit()` without crashing).
- **Phase 1+:** FS-UAE with RTG enabled. Visual verification via FS-UAE screenshots.
- **All phases:** Exit code verification for all example programs.

FS-UAE config must include:
```
graphics_card = uaegfx
graphics_card_memory = 16384
joystick_port_1_mode = nothing
```

## Relationship to amiport

This is a **separate project** from [amiport](https://github.com/bdgscotland/amiport). It does not use amiport's porting pipeline, shim libraries, or test infrastructure. Once `libSDL2.a` is functional, amiport can reference it as a dependency for graphical port candidates.

Shared resources copied from amiport:
- `docs/references/` -- Amiga hardware and API docs (kept in sync manually)
- `.claude/rules/` -- Amiga coding rules (adapted for library development)
- Toolchain Docker image (same `bebbo/amiga-gcc`)
