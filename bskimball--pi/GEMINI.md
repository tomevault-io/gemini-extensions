# AGENTS.md — Custom Pi Configuration

## Purpose

This directory (`~/.pi`) is the workspace for the user's custom Pi configuration. Requests here concern Pi itself — its agents, prompts, skills, extensions, models, MCP integrations, and themes — unless the user explicitly names another repository.

Do not redirect requests to an unrelated application repository based on terms such as "the app," "the UI," or references to earlier work. If the user explicitly names another project, locate it, read its repository instructions, and inspect its worktree before making changes.

## Extension Architecture

Pi discovers extensions two ways: a bare `*.ts` file in `agent/extensions/`, or a directory whose `package.json` declares `pi.extensions`. Everything under a directory that is not a declared entry point is private support code.

```text
agent/extensions/
├── apex/            → apex-ui.ts          Apex UI (shark Observatory, braille indicator, sonar footer)
├── claude/          → claude-ui.ts        Claude UI (star motifs, Claude verbs, Claude Code footer)
├── hal/             → hal-ui.ts           HAL UI (orb landing, square glyphs, HAL panel footer)
├── task/            → amp-task.ts, async-task.ts   sync `task` + async task_* RPC workers

```

### Each Extension Stands On Its Own

This is the load-bearing invariant, enforced by `extensions/test/extension-discovery.test.ts`:

- **No cross-extension source imports.** Every relative import in an entry point's closure must stay under that extension's own directory. Shared UI presentation lives in `packages/ui-kit` (`@pi/ui-kit`), not `agent/extensions/shared` — the test still asserts `extensions/shared` does not exist. Headless helpers (`last-phase.ts`, `terminal-restore.ts`, `process-tree-kill.ts`, `agent-discovery.ts`, `segmenter-safety.ts`) stay duplicated per owner.
- **One entry point per extension, discovered once.** Support code lives in `internal/`, `runtime/`, `presentation/`, `observatory/`, or `test/` so it is never loaded as a second extension.
- **Deleting an extension directory + its entry file removes the feature cleanly**, with no dangling imports elsewhere.

When editing a duplicated helper, decide deliberately whether the change belongs to one owner or all of them, and apply it per owner.

### Three installable UIs

`apex/`, `claude/`, and `hal/` are separately discovered UI extensions. Shared receipts, layout, todo tools, and the single `ToolExecutionComponent` wrap live in `packages/ui-kit`. Deleting one UI directory uninstalls that look. See `CONTEXT.md` for presentation ownership.

- `PI_UI_CHROME=0` is the installation-wide presentation opt-out (`PI_APEX_UI=0` remains a deprecated alias; `PI_UI_CHROME` wins when both are set): it disables custom styling, chrome, and render hooks. Kit-owned tools remain registered and executable. The todo panel stays mounted as a plain, uncolored list.
- `/ui` selects `pi` (stock Pi) or an **installed** UI (`apex`, `claude`, `hal`). Missing UI directories fail closed. Installed custom UIs set `PI_UI_CHROME=1` (and the `PI_APEX_UI` alias) and `PI_UI_SKIN` to their name. Claude uses round receipts and `claude-dark`; HAL uses square receipts, a truecolor orb+wordmark landing, quiet activity, and `hal-dark`. Glyphs are read at call time so a live `/ui` switch applies without a restart; unset `PI_UI_SKIN` falls back to Apex glyphs.
- `/mode work` is operations-first and uses its own prompt rather than the coding-first `agent/SYSTEM.md`. HAL records Brian's commitments in Autotask (ticket or project task) or Microsoft To Do through the `~/Work` CLIs, acts on them, and closes them. The lead works inline-first and dispatches a closed four-specialist crew (strategist, researcher, author, clerk) — no persistent sidekick, no other agents. Business workflows and integrations remain owned by their project.
- Async workers in every mode, including Fusion's sidekicks, use the shared above-editor Agents tab (`alt+a` / `/agents`; `alt+t` / `/todos` still collapse). Click or Enter opens a bounded read-only peek. Settled/failed sessions switch directly only from `/agents peek <id>` or `/agents open <id>` command context; pointer/shortcut peeks prepare that explicit command without replacing a draft. Live JSONL writers are never switched into. Triggers and chrome-off behavior: [`CONTEXT.md` § Todo dock](CONTEXT.md#todo-dock).
- `task/` renders its own cards through its own gate: `PI_TASK_UI=0` disables task cards alone; `PI_UI_CHROME=0` (alias `PI_APEX_UI=0`) disables them too. Task children are spawned with chrome off so workers never paint chrome.
- Headless by design (execute, not chrome): `bg-process`, `powershell`, `web-search`, `continual-memory`, `read-guard`, `lsp`, `prompt-commands` (`browser_attach`). The kit attaches receipt chrome to several of these, skipped entirely when `PI_UI_CHROME=0`. `at-path-complete` is also headless: it only wraps scoped `@` autocomplete. Pi owns standard `read`/`edit` execution and skill invocation lifecycle; the kit owns their interactive chrome.
- Custom footer: each UI owns its look via a pure `buildFooter` renderer passed to `installUiHost` (at most 3 lines; event-cached data only, never a render-time session scan). The kit owns snapshot collection and install/teardown. `/ui pi` and `PI_UI_CHROME=0` (alias `PI_APEX_UI=0`) restore Pi's stock footer.

### Prompt Delivery

Providers do not all consume the same prompt: Pi-native providers send Pi's rendered prompt, while `pi-claude-bridge` rebuilds Claude's prompt from `systemPromptOptions` (`customPrompt`, `appendSystemPrompt`, context files, skills) and drops anything else. Text added any other way silently disappears on that provider (mode cards, memory, and user context were lost this way after switching Opus from `local-proxy` to `claude-bridge`).

- In `before_agent_start`, inject prompt text only by mutating `event.systemPromptOptions` in place (`appendSystemPrompt`, or `customPrompt` to replace the base). Never return `systemPrompt`; Pi turns it into `forceSystemPrompt`, which freezes the prompt for every later handler and is ignored by the bridge.
- `agent/extensions/test/prompt-delivery.test.ts` runs every extension's handlers through Pi's render and the installed bridge projection. When adding or switching a provider that assembles its own prompt, extend that test with the provider's projection before relying on it.
- At runtime, `prompt-commands/modes.ts` warns once when Pi's current system sections lack the active mode card. It cannot see forced prompts (Pi applies them after `context_with_system`); the test is the guard for those.

### Rendering Constraints

These come from real Windows Terminal failures and still apply to any custom rendering:

- No presentation timers: no `setInterval()` render loops, no `tui.requestRender()` on a timer. Pi owns render scheduling.
- Measure and truncate with kit `safe-text-layout.ts` (or the owning extension's copy for headless helpers), never `.length` and never Pi TUI `visibleWidth()`/`truncateToWidth()` in high-frequency custom rendering.
- Keep tool and task output bounded in both line count and character count.
- Sanitize dynamic text; keep ANSI styling simple and balanced; never splice styled strings by JS code-unit offsets.
- Use narrow BMP glyphs. No wide, ambiguous-width, or combining characters.
- Do not scan the full session during a render. Cache derived data outside the render path.

### Observatory Landing Screen

Blank-chat landing is mounted via `ctx.ui.setHeader(...)`. Apex shark/star art lives in `agent/extensions/apex/observatory/`; HAL orb art lives with the HAL UI. The shared Observatory engine is in `packages/ui-kit`. Apex art rules: [`agent/extensions/apex/observatory/README.md`](agent/extensions/apex/observatory/README.md).

### Crash And Stability Diagnostics

`crash-logger.ts` installs the segmenter shield, last-phase breadcrumbs, and terminal-restore watchdog independent of `PI_UI_CHROME`. See `CONTEXT.md` § "Long-session and subagent stability" for the full mechanism.

Logs: `agent/logs/pi-crash.log` (fatal JS), `agent/logs/pi-render.log` (render failures), `agent/logs/pi-lifecycle.log` (compaction, exits), `agent/logs/pi-lsp.log` (LSP diagnostic probes). Read these before blaming a provider or subagent on an unclean session death.

## Validation

```
npm run typecheck                                        # tsc --noEmit, whole config
npm run lint                                             # oxlint, .oxlintrc.json defaults
node --experimental-transform-types --test agent/extensions/test/*.test.ts
node --experimental-transform-types --test agent/extensions/lsp/test/*.test.ts
node --experimental-transform-types --test packages/ui-kit/test/*.test.ts
node --experimental-transform-types --test agent/extensions/task/*.test.ts agent/extensions/task/presentation/*.test.ts agent/extensions/task/runtime/test/*.test.ts
```

Run `extension-discovery.test.ts` after any change to extension layout, entry points, or imports.

## Reference Material

`reference/` holds source material, not runtime data.

- `reference/amp-prompts` — Amp Coding Agent prompts, used as behavioral and structural references when authoring Pi system prompts, agent briefs, and orchestration instructions.
- `reference/pi-tui` — Pi UI concept images and screenshots.

Treat these as references, not active configuration. Do not edit them, and do not create or replace concept images, unless the user explicitly asks.

## Rules

- Treat this directory as the active project when the request concerns custom Pi behavior or configuration.
- Inspect relevant configuration and implementation files before editing them.
- Make the smallest targeted change that satisfies the request; preserve existing user changes and conventions.
- Do not expose secrets, tokens, credentials, browser profiles, or authentication data.
- Do not edit generated or runtime data unless explicitly requested: caches, `agent/sessions/`, `agent/harness/`, `agent/models-store.json`, browser state, `node_modules/`, `graphify-out/`.
- Keep temporary artifacts outside this directory unless they are intentional Pi configuration assets.
