# Yak Package Management for Rhino/Grasshopper

## Overview
Yak is the package manager for Rhino and Grasshopper. It enables publishing, distribution, and installation of plugins.

## Key Information

### Authentication
- User generates a non-expiring API key using `yak login --ci`
- Store this key as a GitHub secret named `YAK_AUTH_TOKEN`
- In GitHub Actions, set the `YAK_TOKEN` environment variable to this secret

### Pre-release Versioning
- Versions with suffixes `-dev`, `-alpha`, `-beta`, or `-rc` are considered pre-releases
- Pre-releases must use the `--pre` flag when pushing to Yak
- Regular releases have no suffix in their version

### Package Structure

A Yak package is a ZIP file containing your plugin files and a `manifest.yml` file. The structure should be as follows:

```
MyPlugin/
├── manifest.yml          # Required: Package metadata
├── icon.png              # Recommended: icon
├── plugin-files.dll      # Plugin files in dll or gha
└── README.md             # Optional: Documentation
```

#### Manifest File

The `manifest.yml` must include:

```yaml
name: MyPlugin
version: 1.0.0
description: A brief description of the plugin
authors: ["Author Name"]
repository_url: https://github.com/username/repository
keywords: ["rhino", "grasshopper", "category"]
icon: icon.png  # Recommended: 64x64px PNG
```

### File Structure
- Windows and Mac plugins must be packaged separately
- Each platform requires its own Yak push command
- Include all dependencies in the package (when build)
- Follow Rhino's plugin structure guidelines for each platform

### Workflow Integration
1. Download Yak CLI executable from McNeel's server
2. Determine if the version is a pre-release
3. Download release assets from GitHub release
4. Push to Yak server with appropriate flags
5. Include proper error handling

## CLI Reference

```bash

# Push a package (non-pre-release)
./yak.exe push path/to/package.zip

# Push a pre-release package
./yak.exe push path/to/package.zip --pre
```

## Environment Variables
- `YAK_TOKEN`: Authentication token for pushing packages to Yak
