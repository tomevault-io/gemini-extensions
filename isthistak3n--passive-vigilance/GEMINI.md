# AGENTS.md — Passive Vigilance Agent Coordination

This file governs how AI agents (Claude Code, Grok) and human contributors
collaborate on this repository. All agents must read this file before taking
any action on the codebase.

---

## Repository Overview

**Project:** Passive Vigilance — passive RF/WiFi/Bluetooth/ADS-B sensor platform  
**Hardware:** Raspberry Pi (Debian ARM64, two nodes)  
**Runtime:** Python 3.x, asyncio, systemd services  
**Goal:** Counter-surveillance and situational awareness via passive sensing

---

## Node Roles

| Node   | Role                                                                 |
|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Pi 3B+ | Mobile node — WiFi/BT, mobile-node scoring; the **mobile recon spoke** (pulls survey taskings from the fixed node, offloads bed-down findings — `design-recon-pair.md`) |
| Pi 4B+ | Fixed base station — WiFi/BT + ADS-B + Remote ID, fixed-mode scoring; the **recon-pair survey server** (issues taskings, receives findings on :8088) |

Live per-node hardware, adapters, and verified status are in **`CONTEXT.md` →
Hardware & Adapter Map** — the authority for what is actually present on each
node. When writing or testing code, always note which node it was validated on.

---

## Agent Roles & Boundaries

### Claude Code (Pi nodes)
**Identity:** `[claude-code]` in commit messages  
**Runs on:** Pi 1 and/or Pi 2 directly  

**Owns:**
- All implementation and execution of Python modules
- Hardware interaction (RTL-SDR, GPS, Kismet, readsb)
- `modules/`, `main.py`, `tests/`, `scripts/`, systemd unit files
- Runtime testing and validation on ARM64 hardware

**Never modifies without coordination:**
- Active `feat/*` branches that another agent is actively working on
- `main` directly — always works on prefixed work branches via PR

**Session discipline:**
- Pull latest branch and read `CONTEXT.md` at the start of every session
- On session close: commit with full context, push, and update run notes in `CONTEXT.md`
- Tag untested code clearly: `# UNTESTED — needs Pi validation`
- Reports: lead with a findings table or bullet list; prose only where a finding needs explanation. No narrative paragraphs.

---

### Grok (GitHub)
**Identity:** `[grok]` in commit messages  
**Runs via:** GitHub plugin  

**Owns:**
- Repo-wide architecture review and refactoring proposals
- PR creation, review, and merge coordination
- Cross-module consistency checks (naming, interfaces, error handling)
- `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CONTEXT.md`, `.github/`, `docs/`
- Maintaining and updating `CONTEXT.md` on every merge to `main`

**Never:**
- Force-pushes to any `feat/*` branch Claude Code has active
- Merges to `main` without at least one confirmed Pi validation in the PR
- Modifies hardware-specific logic without flagging for Claude Code review

---

### Human 
**Identity:** `[human]` in commit messages  
**Role:** Final approver, hardware access, architectural decisions

**Owns:**
- Approving all PRs before merge
- Physical hardware changes, wiring, adapter assignments
- Security decisions (keys, credentials, network config)
- Resolving any agent conflict or ambiguity

---

## Branch Strategy

```
feat|fix|docs|hotfix|refactor/<name>  →  main   (via PR)
```

**Flow:** all work branches cut from `main`, merged back to `main` via PR. No intermediate integration branch.

**Allowed prefixes:** `feat/`, `fix/`, `docs/`, `hotfix/`, `refactor/`

**Gate: work branch → `main`**
- CI must be green
- At least one confirmed Pi validation recorded in the PR
- Human approval
- PR required (ruleset-enforced — direct pushes to `main` are blocked)
- Commits must be **signed** — the ruleset requires verified signatures; an
  unsigned commit shows the PR as BLOCKED until signing is resolved

- Claude Code opens its own PRs; Grok reviews all PRs for cross-module impact before human approval
- There is no docs-only exception — all changes go through the normal PR path

---

## Verification Rules (Mandatory)

**Any claim that a step or task is "completed" and references a code commit must include both:**
- The commit SHA
- The target branch

**Downstream work does not proceed** until **all** of the following are true:
- The SHA is independently verified via `git log` on the target branch
- CI is green on that commit/branch

**CI green is a hard gate before any merge.** No PR may be merged until the CI pipeline passes. This is the institutional enforcement of "verify after every push."

This rule applies to all agents and all claims of completion. Vague or incomplete claims (missing SHA, missing branch, or unverified CI) are treated as invalid.

---

## Commit, PR & Release Standards

The single source of truth for how commits, PR titles, and release notes are
written — for every agent and human contributor.

### Agent commit subject lines (machine-parseable, per-agent attribution)

```
[agent] type(scope): short, plain English description

Body (optional): what changed and why
Tested: <node> / untested        (e.g. Tested: fixed-node, Tested: mobile-node)
Refs: #issue-number
```

**Examples:**
```
[claude-code] feat(sdr): harden SHARED mode with lock + handshake (P1)
Tested: fixed-node
Refs: #22

[grok] refactor(main): integrate SDR health into orchestrator
Tested: untested — needs Claude Code validation on Pi
Refs: #23
```

### Human-readable first (PR titles, release notes, human commits)

Every commit, PR, and release must be human-readable first, technical second.

**PR titles / human commit subjects** — plain English, outcome-focused, ≤72 chars.
Use "Add", "Fix", "Improve", "Extend" — not scope tags.
- Bad:  `fix/operational-resilience` · `fix(review): version string, tunable poll intervals`
- Good: `Health banner, auto-reconnect, and sensor resilience`

**Body** — a bullet list of what got better for the operator, not implementation
details. Group related changes. No "FIX 1… FIX 10" numbering; technical detail
goes in the body, never the subject.

**Release notes** — always: (1) one sentence on what the release means,
(2) a "What's better now" plain-English bullet list, (3) the test count,
(4) optional "Under the hood" technical section.

Never: number fixes, lead with a scope tag as the summary, write release notes
that read like a debug log, or bury the user benefit in implementation detail.

## GitHub Issues as Task Queue

| Label          | Assigned To   | Meaning                                      |
|----------------|---------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `claude-code`  | Claude Code   | Implementation or hardware testing task      |
| `grok`         | Grok          | Review, refactor, or documentation task      |
| `human`        | Ask for name  | Requires physical access or final decision   |
| `blocked`      | —            | Waiting on another agent or hardware         |
| `needs-pi-test`| Claude Code   | Code written but not yet validated on hardware |
| `ready-to-merge`| Grok + Human | PR reviewed, Pi-tested, awaiting approval    |

---

## Merge Checklist (Grok enforces on every PR)

- [ ] Commit messages follow `[agent] type(scope):` format
- [ ] At least one `Tested: <node>` (e.g. `Tested: fixed-node`) in commit history (required on every PR to `main`)
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials, API keys, or local paths
- [ ] New modules added to `CLAUDE.md` → Module Map
- [ ] systemd unit file included if module runs as a service
- [ ] No x86-only dependencies (check against `requirements.txt`)
- [ ] `CONTEXT.md` updated to reflect new state post-merge
- [ ] CI green on the target branch/commit
- [ ] PR required — direct pushes to `main` are blocked by the repository ruleset
- [ ] CodeQL code-scanning must pass — high+ severity security alerts block merge (ruleset-enforced)

---

## Conflict Resolution

If two agents have modified the same file on different branches:
1. Grok identifies the conflict in PR review and flags it
2. Claude Code resolves on the feature branch (runtime/hardware context wins)
3. Human approves resolution before merge

**Hardware truth beats repo truth.** If code works in theory but fails on Pi, the Pi is right.

---

## Security Rules for All Agents

Deployment hardening and vulnerability reporting live in **`SECURITY.md`**.
Commit-time hygiene every agent must follow:

- Never commit secrets, API keys, WiGLE credentials, or SSH keys
- GPS data and MAC-address logs are sensitive — no sample data in commits
- `.gitignore` must cover `*.log`, `*.gpx`, `*.shp`, `data/`, `captures/`
