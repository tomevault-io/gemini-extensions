# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance for AI coding agents working in the
`rest-api/` tree of the `infra-controller` repository.

## Project Overview

**NVIDIA Infrastructure Controller REST** is a collection of Go microservices that comprise
the management backend for NVIDIA Infrastructure Controller (NICo), exposed as a REST API. It
provides multi-tenant, API-driven bare-metal lifecycle management, working in
concert with Core services for on-site hardware operations.

> **Status:** Active development. APIs, configurations, and features may
> change without notice between releases.

### Key Responsibilities

- REST API for hardware inventory, provisioning, and lifecycle orchestration
- Multi-tenant site and instance management
- Temporal-based cloud and site workflow orchestration
- On-site agent for datacenter-local operations
- IP address management (IPAM)
- Authentication and authorization (Keycloak, JWT, service accounts)
- Native PKI certificate management
- CLI client (`nicocli`) with interactive TUI

## Build, Test, and Lint Commands

### Building

```bash
# Build all binaries (linux/amd64, static)
make build

# Build and install CLI to $GOPATH/bin
make nico-cli

# Build Docker images (production)
make docker-build

# Build Docker images (local dev, public base images)
make docker-build-local
```

### Testing

```bash
# Run all tests (auto-manages PostgreSQL container)
make test

# Module-level tests
make test-api
make test-db
make test-workflow
make test-auth
make test-common
make test-cert-manager
make test-site-agent        # starts mock Core and Flow gRPC servers first
make test-site-manager
make test-site-workflow
make test-ipam

# PostgreSQL management for tests
make postgres-up            # start test PostgreSQL container
make postgres-down          # stop test PostgreSQL container
make ensure-postgres        # start if not running, wait until ready
make migrate                # run database migrations against test DB
```

Tests require a PostgreSQL container (postgres:14.4-alpine) on port 30432.
The Makefile manages this automatically via `ensure-postgres`.

Use these targets rather than calling `go test` yourself, because they start what the tests
need and skipping that setup does not fail fast:

- `make test-site-agent` starts mock Core and Flow gRPC servers. Without them the
  `site-agent/pkg/components` tests retry the connection on a `40s` backoff until the `10m`
  test timeout, so a bare `go test ./site-agent/...` looks like a hang rather than an error.
  That target also scopes to `site-agent/pkg/components` and sets `CGO_ENABLED=1` for `-race`,
  so it is not the same package set or the same build.
- `test-api`, `test-auth`, `test-db`, `test-flow`, `test-ipam`, `test-nvswitch-manager`,
  `test-powershelf-manager`, and `test-workflow` call `ensure-postgres` first.
- Every Postgres-backed package resets the schema, so packages running in parallel drop and
  recreate the same tables and fail in `TestSetupSchema`. Pass `-p 1` whenever you do run
  `go test` against more than one of them directly.

### Linting and Formatting

```bash
# Check formatting (fails if repo is dirty after go fmt)
make fmt-go

# Run all linters (go vet + golangci-lint + revive)
make lint-go

# Auto-fix formatting
go fmt ./...
```

### OpenAPI

```bash
# Lint the OpenAPI spec
make lint-openapi

# Preview in Redoc UI (http://127.0.0.1:8090)
make preview-openapi

# Generate Go SDK from OpenAPI spec
make generate-sdk
```

`generate-sdk` uses a pinned openapi-generator, downloaded to `.tools/` and
checksum-verified on first use, because the generated SDK is byte-for-byte
dependent on the generator version. Do not install the generator separately to
bypass the pin. Raising `OPENAPI_GENERATOR_VERSION` belongs in its own change
alongside the regenerated `sdk/standard/`, since a new generator rewrites files
no spec edit touched.

### Protobuf Code Generation

```bash
make nico-proto          # fetch proto files from nico-core
make nico-protogen       # generate Go code from protos
make flow-proto             # fetch Flow proto files
make flow-protogen          # generate Go code from Flow protos
```

### Local Development (Kind cluster)

```bash
make kind-reset             # full reset: cluster + infra + Helm deploy
make kind-reset-kustomize   # full reset with Kustomize instead of Helm
make kind-redeploy          # rebuild and restart (fast iteration)
make helm-redeploy          # rebuild and restart via Helm
make kind-status            # check pod status
make kind-logs              # tail API logs
make kind-verify            # health checks
make kind-down              # tear down cluster
```

## Coding Conventions

Follow the shared [Engineering Guidelines](../CONTRIBUTING.md#engineering-guidelines)
for scope control, reuse-before-new-code, evidence-backed assumptions, and
verification expectations.

- Follow standard Go conventions; `go fmt` is enforced in CI.
- Linting uses `golangci-lint` (v2 config in `.golangci.yml`) with most
  linters enabled, plus `revive` (config in `.revive.toml`).
- Use `testify` (assert/require) for test assertions.
- When a test verifies a generated CLI command path, assert that the leaf
  command has a non-nil `Action`; path presence alone does not prove the
  command is runnable.
- For a tenant-owned TUI resource picker, resolve the current tenant explicitly,
  send its ID in the list request, and require each returned row to match that
  exact tenant ID. Test a dual-role caller whose response also contains
  provider-owned and other-tenant resources.
- When a site-wide TUI resource picker must ignore a narrower active scope,
  clear that scope and invalidate filtered caches before fetching, then restore
  the scope and invalidate filtered caches again on every return path so
  site-wide entries cannot be reused under the restored scope. Test the scoped
  case.
- Tests that need a database use a PostgreSQL container (testcontainers-go
  or the Makefile-managed container).
- Organize tests by the production function or method under test, not by individual
  scenarios. Use one top-level test function named `Test<Receiver>_<Method>` or
  `Test<Function>`—for example `TestIsStrInSlice` for `IsStrInSlice` and `TestGetAllSkuHandler_Handle` for `GetAllSkuHandler.Handle`. Define individual test
  cases in a table and execute each case as a named `t.Run` subtest. Do not create
  separate top-level test functions for each test case.
- Tests run with `-p 1` (serial) and often with `-race`.
- API handlers live in `api/pkg/api/handler/`, request/response models in
  `api/pkg/api/model/`, and DB models in `db/pkg/db/model/`.
- OpenAPI schema in `openapi/spec.yaml` must be updated whenever routes in the
  published API surface are added or modified.
- Give every newly introduced OpenAPI object a realistic example backed by an
  existing contract, configuration, or test fixture. Keep example IDs, enum
  values, nullability, and timing semantics valid under OpenAPI lint.
- When adding a request/response field to a resource that has both single-item
  and batch endpoints, update the full surface together: single create/update
  DTOs, batch create/update DTOs, handlers, DAO input structs, persistence,
  OpenAPI, SDK, and tests. Do not stop after the single handler path.
- Endpoint handlers should use the following name prefix convention consistently (Instance resource used as example):
  - GET single object: GetInstanceHandler
  - GET multiple objects: GetAllInstanceHandler
  - POST single object: CreateInstanceHandler
  - POST multiple objects: BatchCreateInstanceHandler
  - PUT object: CreateOrUpdateInstance
  - PATCH object: UpdateInstance
  - PATCH multiple objects: BatchUpdateInstance
  - DELETE object: DeleteInstance
- Corresponding API request models should have the following naming convention:
  - POST: APIInstanceCreateRequest
  - PATCH: APIInstanceUpdateRequest
  - PUT: APIInstanceCreateOrUpdateRequest
  - DELETE: APIInstanceDeleteRequest
  - GET: Request objects are typically not used for GET requests
- Optional string fields that support clearing through PATCH use `""` as the
  explicit clear value. Omission or JSON `null` preserves the stored value;
  model these as `*string` instead of adding custom presence tracking.
- API models should have the following naming conventions:
  - APIInstance: For full Instance details
  - APIInstanceSummary: For summary objects nested under other API resource objects
- When a JSON request body exists, put IDs such as `siteId` in that body
  and validate them on the DTO; use query parameters for filters/read-only
  selectors.
- Successful POST/PUT responses should return the updated object, but omit
  passwords and other credentials. Keep OpenAPI
  descriptions focused on the REST contract rather than internal gRPC
  implementation details.
- When an authoritative external create returns a contract-critical value,
  persist it in the request transaction before returning 2xx and independently
  assert the response and database state. Do not rely on a best-effort cache or
  later reconciliation for read-after-create behavior.
- API-layer enum-like request constants exposed through JSON use CapitalCase
  values, for example `SiteWideRoot` and `BMCRoot`.
- When prose names exact API enum values, format the literals as code, for
  example `Set`, `Clear`, and `Restart`, so they are distinct from verbs.
- For disruptive machine operations, decide and encode the attached-Instance
  behavior explicitly. If an operation can power-cycle or otherwise disrupt a
  tenant workload, check `Machine.IsAssigned` (or the equivalent association)
  and reject unless the product requirement explicitly allows Provider Admins
  to override tenant attachment
- Avoid declaring new types that are just an array of another type. Simply use an
  array of the original object
- Be prudent when declaring utility functions that pass around arbitrary set of
  arguments. If it's used only once or breaks the flow of reading the caller code,
  it is often better to keep the logic inline

### Interactive CLI review checks

- When an option consumes a separate value, test that another option token is
  rejected instead of consumed as that value.
- Propagate terminal restoration errors. Restore the terminal successfully
  before starting another interactive selector. Return one non-nil error
  unchanged. Use `errors.Join` only when the operation and restoration both
  fail. Treat only a direct cancellation sentinel as successful so a joined
  restoration failure propagates. Test normal PTY, cancellation, and
  restoration-failure paths.
- Table-test shell argument quoting with empty input, whitespace, quotes,
  backslashes, control characters, non-ASCII text, and shell metacharacters.
- When a mutation success message reads fields from a response object, reject
  malformed JSON, `null`, empty objects, and missing display fields before
  printing success. Use the returned resource values rather than echoing
  request or discovery values that the server may default or normalize, and
  test a response whose value differs from the pre-request value.

### REST endpoints through the Core gRPC proxy

When building or converting a REST endpoint that calls on-site NICo Core through
the generic gRPC proxy, follow
[`skills/rest-core-grpc-proxy/SKILL.md`](skills/rest-core-grpc-proxy/SKILL.md).

### REST endpoints through the Flow gRPC proxy

When building or converting a REST endpoint that calls on-site Flow through the
generic gRPC proxy, follow
[`skills/rest-flow-grpc-proxy/SKILL.md`](skills/rest-flow-grpc-proxy/SKILL.md).
Callers supply the Temporal workflow ID and conflict policy (unlike CoreProxy).

### REST endpoint implementation patterns

Before adding REST API code, find the nearest existing endpoint family and copy
its shape. The central route list in `api/pkg/api/routes.go` already covers the
main patterns:

- Plain DB-backed resources use the resource triplet
  `api/pkg/api/handler/<resource>.go`, `api/pkg/api/model/<resource>.go`, and
  corresponding `*_test.go` files. VPC, Instance Type, SSH Key Group, Network
  Security Group, and Operating System are good references for ordinary
  create/get/list/update/delete surfaces.
- Site-scoped cloud-to-site operations pass a site client pool into the handler
  constructor (`scp *site.ClientPool`) and resolve the site before calling
  Temporal or Core. VPC, Subnet, Expected Machine/Rack/Switch, Flow Rack/Tray,
  Machine Validation, and Tenant Identity endpoints are the reference families.
- Flow-backed inventory and task APIs use Flow request/response protobufs in the
  API model layer and keep target-shape helpers next to the model or handler
  that owns the REST shape. Use Rack, Tray, Task, and Task Rule as references.
  Every Flow-backed endpoint dispatches through the generic proxy, so use
  `handler/util/common.ProxyFlowGRPC` (or `ExecuteFlowGRPC` where the caller
  must return a plain `error`) rather than adding a bespoke Temporal workflow
  per method. Retiring the bespoke workflows spans releases; see the skill for
  the required order.
- Curated REST endpoints that call NICo Core `forge.Forge` unary methods should
  use `handler/util/common.ExecuteCoreGRPC` with a typed protobuf request. Do
  not create a bespoke Temporal workflow for a simple unary Core call. BMC
  Credential is the reference for auth, site lookup, secret redaction, and a
  password-free response.
- Public discovery endpoints belong in `NewWellKnownRoutes`, not the normal
  authenticated `NewAPIRoutes` list. The Tenant Identity `.well-known/*`
  endpoints are security-sensitive because they are mounted before auth
  middleware.

- Use receiver methods named `FromDBModel` and `ToDBModel` for conversions
  between API and DB models. Prefer `FromDBModel` over new `NewX` conversion
  constructors as existing models are updated.
- Give every API model attribute a structured schema; do not expose schemaless
  JSON. JSON tags use camelCase, and API constants use PascalCase. In exceptional
  cases where industry standards differ e.g. well known JWKS endpoints - snake_case
  can be used
- Review the existing endpoint routes before choosing a new route or attribute
  name. Published names are compatibility commitments and require deprecation
  before they can be replaced. Follow these REST conventions:
  - Use POST to create resources.
  - Use PATCH to update resources.
  - Use PUT only when an endpoint supports both creation and update.
  - End PATCH, GET, and DELETE routes with the resource ID unless the resource
    has no unique identifier
  - Return pagination metadata in the `X-Pagination` response header for GET
    requests that return multiple resources.
  - Query params are encouraged only for GET requests that return multiple objects
- API request models should use ozzo validation for simple validations instead of
  validating data in the handler. Complex validations involving multiple
  request attributes can be done in `Validate` receiver function. All errors returned
  from `Validate` receiver function should have `validation.Errors` type

Keep handlers thin and reuse the common surfaces already in the tree:

1. Start handlers with `common.SetupHandler`, defer the span end, check the
   request user, then validate org membership and roles with the authorization
   helpers used by the neighboring handler.
2. Bind request bodies into `api/pkg/api/model` DTOs and call `Validate` before
   conversion or side effects. Keep syntactic and cross-field request rules in
   `Validate`; keep auth, ownership, site readiness, and DB-backed checks in the
   handler where context is available.
3. Use `IsProviderOrTenant` from `rest-api/api/pkg/api/handler/util/common/common.go`
   to retrieve Provider and Tenant objects. When adding list endpoints, reuse
   `pagination.PageRequest`, `common.ValidateKnownQueryParams`, and `common.GetSearchQuery`.
4. Put request-to-proto conversion on the API request type and entity-to-proto
   conversion on the DB model, following the "Proto conversion methods" section
   below. `ToProto` should trust prior validation instead of returning errors
   for the same rules.
5. Use `cdb.WithTx` or `cdb.WithTxResult` for write transactions, and translate
   closure errors with `common.HandleTxError`. Return `cutil.NewAPIError` inside
   a transaction closure and `cutil.NewAPIErrorResponse` outside it.
6. For synchronous Temporal workflows, reuse the existing workflow ID,
   timeout, task queue, `common.UnwrapWorkflowError`, and
   `common.TerminateWorkflowOnTimeOut` patterns from the nearest handler instead
   of inventing new error plumbing. When a request spans caller, workflow, and
   activity or RPC deadlines, keep those budgets strictly increasing toward the
   caller and test every boundary; an outer timeout alone does not bound work
   that has already started.
7. Return curated REST models, not DB models, Core protobufs, Flow protobufs, or
   secret-bearing request bodies. Log identifiers, method names, kinds, and
   site IDs; do not log raw request bodies that may contain credentials
8. API endpoints should generally return following HTTP codes on success:
   - GET: 200
   - POST: 201 if a new object is created, 202 if async processing is triggered with no object to return, otherwise 200
   - PATCH: 200
   - PUT: 201 if a new object is created, otherwise 200
   - DELETE: 204 if object is deleted immediately, 202 if object is deleted async
   - For 202 or 204 responses where no object can be returned `APIMessageResponse` should be returned
9. When API handler encounters an error:
   - Data validation errors should return 400
   - If an object ID is specified in URL and the corresponding object cannot be found, then 404 should be returned
   - If an object ID is specified in query param or request JSON data and the corresponding object cannot be found, then 400 should be returned
   - When resource cannot be created due to another existing resource, 409 should be returned
   - When user doesn't have permission to execute an action, 403 should be returned
   - Any unexpected error should return 500
   - All error response should be returned in `APIError` format

When registering a new route:

- Add it to `NewAPIRoutes` with the existing `/org/:orgName/<apiName>` prefix
  unless it is a system or public discovery route.
- Keep literal/static routes such as `/batch`, `/stats`, `/validation`,
  `/power`, and `.well-known/*` before parameterized `/:id` routes that could
  otherwise capture them.
- Update `api/pkg/api/routes_test.go`: increment the route family count, add an
  `assertRouteExists` check for any new route shape, and add `assertRouteBefore`
  when a static route could be shadowed by a parameterized route.
- For routes published in the OpenAPI surface, update `openapi/spec.yaml` in the
  same change. System and public discovery routes that are intentionally outside
  that surface are exempt. Keep operation IDs, summaries, handler constructors,
  handler godoc, and SDK-facing names aligned.
- When an OpenAPI tag or operation ID changes, build the generated CLI command
  tree and run the affected `nicocli ... --help` paths to catch alias collisions.

Endpoint tests should follow the changed surface, not just compile it:

- Model tests cover `Validate`, query validation, enum values, list-level
  constraints, and `ToProto` / `FromProto` mappings.
- Handler tests cover auth role, org membership, missing user, invalid IDs,
  ownership/site checks, request validation, status codes, and the response
  shape
- List handler tests cover paging inputs and assert the `X-Pagination` response
  header.
- Site/Core/Flow handlers should assert the workflow or proxy request arguments,
  workflow ID inputs, secret field names, timeout behavior where relevant, and
  that secrets are absent from responses and logs.
- Operator examples must keep credentials out of command arguments; use a
  supported prompt, stdin, or protected secret file. For asynchronous HTTP 202
  operations, document the real completion signal and terminal states. Do not
  present a resource read or poll as completion unless the API contract exposes
  that transition.
- Route tests and OpenAPI checks are part of the endpoint change; generated SDK
  updates belong in the same change only when the repo workflow requires them.
- When one response model serves endpoints with different nullability
  contracts, preserve each endpoint's schema in its constructor or use distinct
  models. Test unavailable values at every affected response boundary.

### Prefer range-based iteration over C-style `for` loops

The module is on Go 1.26.4, so reach for range-based iteration before the
three-clause `for i := 0; i < n; i++` / `i--` form. Range-over-integer and
range-over-function iterators (`slices.Backward`, `slices.All`,
`slices.Values`, `maps.Keys`, `maps.Values`, …) drop the manual index
bookkeeping that the older form makes a reader re-derive to trust.

1. **Counting loop → range-over-integer.** When the bound is a count (not a
   slice you also index for values), use `for i := range n` (index needed) or
   `for range n` (index unused) instead of `for i := 0; i < n; i++`. This
   covers `reflect` walks: `for i := range v.NumField()` /
   `for i := range v.Len()`.
2. **Reverse loop → `slices.Backward`.** Replace
   `for i := len(s) - 1; i >= 0; i--` with `for i, v := range slices.Backward(s)`.
   When the reverse order is intentional (LIFO teardown, "find the last element
   matching X"), `slices.Backward` states that intent instead of leaving it
   implicit in the index arithmetic. Use `for i := range slices.Backward(s)`
   when you only need the index (to take `&s[i]` or mutate `s[i]`).
3. **Index loop over a slice → plain `range`.** `for i := 0; i < len(s); i++`
   that reads `s[i]` becomes `for i, v := range s` (or `for _, v := range s`);
   keep the index-only `for i := range s` when the body needs `&s[i]`.

Keep the C-style form when range can't express the loop, and say why if it
isn't obvious:

- **Byte-wise string scans.** A loop that indexes `s[i]` on a `string` must
  stay C-style — `for i := range s` over a string yields *runes*, silently
  changing byte offsets.
- **The index is mutated or looks ahead/behind** in the body (`i++` to consume
  a paired argument, `s[i+1]`, `i = j-1`). Range indices are read-only.
- **1-indexed or offset-start loops** (`for page := 1; page <= total; page++`,
  `for i := windowStart; i < windowEnd; i++`). Range-over-integer is 0-based;
  forcing a `+1` reads worse than the original.
- **Generated code** (e.g. `sdk/standard`) — leave it; regeneration overwrites
  hand edits.

A related cleanup: a backward byte scan for a delimiter is
`strings.LastIndexByte`, not a hand-rolled `for i := idx; i >= 0; i--` — see
`(*IPAddr).Scan` in `powershelf-manager/pkg/db/model/types.go`.

### Proto conversion methods

DB and API model types that round-trip with a workflow-schema (`corev1`)
or Flow (`flowv1`) protobuf types carry conversion as receiver methods, not
free functions. The convention layers cleanly so call sites are
predictable and every entity has the same surface:

1. **Primary entity ↔ proto entity** lives on the DB model:
   `func (m *T) ToProto(...) *protoT` and
   `func (m *T) FromProto(p *protoT, ...)` — symmetric pair, defined
   together. `FromProto` mutates the receiver and returns no error.
   The field-level contract is:
   - A `nil` proto is a no-op (receiver untouched).
   - Required ID fields (e.g. `m.ID`) are preserved on a missing or
     unparseable proto value, because callers pre-validate UUIDs
     before calling.
   - Optional pointer fields are cleared when the proto omits them
     **or** when the proto value is invalid (e.g. an unparseable
     UUID). For example, `(*Vpc).FromProto` clears
     `NVLinkLogicalPartitionID` in both cases so the receiver ends
     up as a clean reset rather than a partial merge.
2. **Per-API-request → proto request** lives on the corresponding API
   request type, not on the entity:
   `func (req *APIXCreateRequest) ToProto(...) *protoXCreateRequest`,
   `func (req *APIXUpdateRequest) ToProto(...) *protoXUpdateRequest`.
   These methods commonly read the canonical fields via the entity's
   `ToProto()` (passed in or fetched) and overlay request-specific
   fields. Putting them on the API request type keeps the entity
   surface focused on the canonical representation. When the API
   request type uses `*T` to distinguish "field not provided" (nil)
   from "explicitly clear" (non-nil pointer to zero value), the
   request's `ToProto` is responsible for preserving that distinction
   on the wire — overriding the entity-derived value when the API
   request touched the field, even if the post-merge entity has the
   same zero value.

   **`ToProto` does not return errors.** It trusts that the request
   has already been validated and that the handler has performed any
   cross-context checks Validate cannot see. Validation lives in
   `(req *APIXCreateRequest).Validate() error`, which is the
   universal pre-`ToProto` step and must be called before the request
   reaches `ToProto`. Anything `ToProto` would otherwise have to
   double-check — width casts on bounded request fields, enum-value
   checks, cross-field structural rules — belongs in `Validate`
   instead, so the translation step stays a focused mapper.

   If a Core proto request needs values from both the URL path and the
   JSON body, assemble those values on the API request object before
   conversion. Use non-JSON fields, for example a `MachineID` field
   tagged with `json:"-"`, for path-derived context. Set those fields
   explicitly in the handler, then call `req.ToProto()` with no hidden
   path-parameter arguments. Avoid
   call sites like `req.ToProto(machineID)` when `req` came from the
   body; they make readers re-discover where each proto field came from.
   Name the file, handler, request/response DTOs, and OpenAPI schemas
   after the REST resource and operation (`machinepower`,
   `MachinePowerControlHandler`, `APIMachinePowerControlRequest`), not an
   internal Core method or authorization concept. Prefer typed string enums
   with receiver conversion methods such as `(MachinePowerAction).ToProto()`
   over free conversion helpers. For simple response shapes, build the
   response inline in the handler; reserve constructor helpers for real
   construction logic. Shared handler helpers should return `*cutil.APIError`
   when callers need to preserve client-facing status codes and messages.

   **What stays in the handler:** authorization (RBAC, tenant
   privileges, cross-resource ownership lookups), and validation that
   depends on context `Validate` cannot see (site config defaults
   resolved at request time, DAO lookups, etc.). These run before
   `ToProto` so that by the time it executes the request is safe to
   trust.
3. **Entity-level request shapes that don't have an API request body**
   (e.g. delete by path-param, maintenance / metadata-update flows that
   carry no client payload) stay on the entity:
   `func (m *T) ToDeletionRequestProto() *protoXDeletionRequest`,
   `func (m *T) ToMaintenanceRequestProto(...) *protoXMaintenanceRequest`.
4. **Side inputs that are not on the model** (BMC credentials, a linked
   machine ID resolved by the caller, a fallback timestamp, validated /
   converted enum values) are passed as additional arguments —
   preferably grouped into a `XCredentials` struct declared next to the
   model, with a comment explaining why the field isn't persisted.
5. **Sub-messages of a proto request:** when a request DTO produces a
   reusable piece of a proto request that is shared across multiple
   request types (e.g. `OperationTargetSpec`, `[]*Filter`), name the
   method after the sub-message it returns: `ToTargetSpec()`,
   `ToFilters()` (see `RackFilter`, `APIRackGetAllRequest`).
6. **Constructor wrappers for `FromProto`:** API model types that are
   constructed from a proto in handlers commonly expose a
   `func NewAPIX(p *protoX) *APIX` wrapper that returns `nil` for a `nil`
   proto and otherwise builds the value and calls `FromProto`. See
   `NewAPITray`, `NewAPIRack`.

`Vpc` is the reference implementation for rules 1–3:
`(*cdbm.Vpc).ToProto/FromProto` cover the entity↔proto round-trip,
`(*model.APIVpcCreateRequest).ToProto` / `(*model.APIVpcUpdateRequest).ToProto`
cover request-shape conversion, and `(*cdbm.Vpc).ToDeletionRequestProto`
stays on the entity because there's no API request body for delete.

`InstanceType` is the reference for everything else under this rollout
(typed-slice validation, typed-map proto behavior, ozzo composition,
shared conversion helpers): `(*cdbm.InstanceType).ToProto/FromProto`

- `(*InstanceType).AttachCapabilities` on the entity,
`APIMachineCapabilities` + `APIMachineCapability` for the list/element
split, `cdbm.Labels` for the typed map, and
`common/pkg/util.IntPtrToUint32Ptr` for shared casts.

### Validate cooperates with ToProto

`Validate` and `ToProto` work as a pair: `Validate` enforces every rule
the wire format relies on, and `ToProto` is a pure mapper that trusts
the result. The conventions below are how the rules are organised.

1. **Prefer ozzo's built-in rules.** `validation.Required`,
   `validation.Min`, `validation.Max`, `validation.In`,
   `validation.Length`, `validation.By`, `validation.Each` compose
   cleanly inside `validation.ValidateStruct`. Custom helpers like a
   `validateXBounds(value, name)` free function are usually
   unnecessary — reach for them only when no built-in fits.
2. **List-level rules live on a typed slice.** When a request carries
   a slice and needs both per-element rules and rules that span
   elements (uniqueness, ordering, cross-element constraints), define
   `type APIXs []APIX` with its own `Validate()` that calls
   `validation.Validate(s, validation.Each())` to delegate per-element
   checks and then enforces the list-level rules. The parent struct
   wires it up with a single `validation.Field(&parent.Xs)`; ozzo
   discovers the typed slice's `Validate` via the Validatable
   interface. See `(APIMachineCapabilities).Validate` for the
   canonical shape.
3. **Cross-field rules use named methods via `validation.By`.** When a
   check spans multiple fields on the same struct, pull it out as a
   named method on the type and reference it with
   `validation.By(t.validateX)`. Avoid inline anonymous closures —
   named methods are discoverable, individually testable, and the
   `Validate` body reads like a high-level outline of the rules. See
   `(APIMachineCapability).validateDeviceType` and
   `validateInactiveDevices`.
4. **Validators that compose with `validation.By` take `interface{}`.**
   Helpers used across structs (e.g. `util.ValidateLabels`,
   `util.ValidateNameCharacters`) match ozzo's `RuleFunc` signature
   `func(value interface{}) error`, so they drop into
   `validation.Field(&t.Field, validation.By(util.ValidateX))`
   directly. Internal type assertion handles the concrete type.

### Named types own their proto behavior

A `map`, `slice`, or other primitive composite that represents a
domain concept with conversion needs gets a named type with methods,
not a free function. The receiver-method form keeps the call site
discoverable (`t.Field.ToProto()` / `t.Field.FromProto(...)`) and
makes the type the single home for all related behavior. Free
functions like `LabelsToProto(m map[string]string)` or
`LabelsFromProtoMetadata(md *Metadata) Labels` are an anti-pattern —
make the value typed and put the method on it.

`FromProto` on a leaf named type is a pointer-receiver method that
mutates the receiver in place, mirroring the entity-level
`(*T).FromProto` shape. A `nil` input clears the receiver to its
zero value so callers can distinguish "no data reported" from "data
explicitly cleared." Reach the method on a struct field with
`t.Field.FromProto(...)` — which requires the field itself to use
the named type, not the underlying primitive. Entity struct fields
that round-trip with the proto should be typed accordingly (e.g.
`Labels Labels` instead of `Labels map[string]string`); CreateInput
/ UpdateInput shapes that don't call `FromProto` themselves may stay
on the underlying primitive until they need it.

- `db/pkg/db/model.Labels` (`type Labels map[string]string` with
  `(Labels).ToProto() []*corev1.Label` and
  `(*Labels).FromProto([]*corev1.Label)`) is the reference for
  map-shaped values that round-trip with workflow `Metadata.Labels`.
  Entity callers reach it via `entity.Labels.FromProto(proto.Metadata.GetLabels())`
  — the proto getter is nil-safe and returns `nil` for missing
  metadata, which the method translates into a `nil` receiver.
- `db/pkg/db/model.MachineCapabilityType` and `MachineCapabilityDeviceType`
  (`type X string` with `(X).ToProto() corev1.X` and
  `(*X).FromProto(corev1.X)`) are the reference for **typed-string
  domain enums** that round-trip with proto enum values. The DB column
  stays a plain string under the named type, but the conversion to /
  from the proto enum lives as methods on the type — not as a free
  helper. `(*MachineCapability).ToProto` collapses to
  `mc.Type.ToProto()` / `mc.DeviceType.ToProto()`, and `FromProto`
  collapses to `mc.Type.FromProto(...)`. Unknown values silently leave
  the receiver as the empty string (a warning is logged) so the
  entity-level `Validate` can be the gate that rejects them; an
  optional `*X` field with the proto's zero-value enum on the wire
  drops to `nil` rather than encoding an "unknown" pointer.
- `APIMachineCapabilities` (`type APIMachineCapabilities
  []APIMachineCapability` with `(APIMachineCapabilities).Validate()`)
  is the reference for slice-shaped values that own list-level rules.

### Shared conversion helpers live in `common/pkg/util`

Helpers that convert primitive types (`*int` ↔ `*uint32`, etc.) and
have no entity association live in `common/pkg/util/converter.go`,
not in entity-specific files. Under the ToProto / FromProto
convention they are trusted casts: the bounds checks live in
`Validate` upstream of them, so the helpers do not return errors and
do not log warnings — anything that needs to fail belongs in
`Validate`. `common/pkg/util.IntPtrToUint32Ptr` is the reference.

### Database transactions

Handler code that touches the database uses the closure-based transaction
helpers from `db/pkg/db`, not manual `BeginTx`/`Commit`/`Rollback`. Most of
the rules below are lessons from the WithTx migration of every primary
handler — applying them keeps the next handler's diff predictable.

1. **Use `cdb.WithTx` / `cdb.WithTxResult`.** Both run the closure in a
   transaction and unwind it for you on error. `WithTxResult[T]` returns a
   single `T` from the closure; `WithTx` returns only `error` and uses
   outer-scope variables for any outputs.
2. **Pick one or the other — don't mix.** `WithTxResult` paired with
   outer-scope partner vars populated inside the closure is the worst of
   both worlds. Either use `WithTxResult` cleanly (single value out) or use
   `WithTx` with every output as an outer-scope variable. The Network
   Security Group, InfiniBand Partition, and VPC Prefix handlers were
   reworked specifically to settle this.
3. **Reads belong outside the transaction unless they need to be inside.**
   Pure input-validation reads (does this site exist, does the tenant own
   it, is the SSH key on this tenant) hold the tx open and pin a DB
   connection for no benefit. Move them above the `cdb.WithTx(...)` call
   and start the tx only when writes begin. Reads that *do* belong inside
   are: anything done under an advisory lock for race protection,
   anything whose result drives a write decision that must see the locked
   state (e.g. existing associations used for sync-state diff), and
   reads done in the same tx as their dependent writes for read-your-writes
   consistency.
4. **Acquire an advisory lock at the top of the closure for TOCTOU-prone
   flows.** When the closure does read-then-mutate on one entity (or two
   concurrent writers could both pass a pre-flight check), call
   `tx.TryAcquireAdvisoryLock(ctx, cdb.GetAdvisoryLockIDFromString(<key>), nil)`
   first. After the lock, re-read whatever you pre-checked outside the tx
   so the check and the write happen against the same snapshot. Don't keep
   the pre-flight check around if the in-tx check covers it — one source
   of truth is clearer than two.
5. **Workflow-trigger flows use the `timeoutResp` pattern.** When the
   closure does `stc.ExecuteWorkflow` + `we.Get(...)`, a timeout has to
   terminate the workflow *after* the DB tx unwinds so the cleanup call
   doesn't block holding a connection. Declare `var timeoutResp func() error`
   in the outer scope, set it inside the timeout branch, return a
   `cutil.NewAPIError` from the closure to roll back the tx, then call
   `timeoutResp()` after `WithTx` returns:

   ```go
   var timeoutResp func() error
   err = cdb.WithTx(ctx, dbSession, func(tx *cdb.Tx) error {
       // ... writes ...
       we, wferr := stc.ExecuteWorkflow(wfCtx, opts, "CreateInstanceV2", req)
       // ... wferr handling ...
       wferr = we.Get(wfCtx, nil)
       if wferr != nil {
           var timeoutErr *tp.TimeoutError
           if errors.As(wferr, &timeoutErr) || wferr == context.DeadlineExceeded || wfCtx.Err() != nil {
               timeoutCause := wferr // explicit capture; defensive against future refactors
               timeoutResp = func() error {
                   return common.TerminateWorkflowOnTimeOut(c, logger, stc, wid, timeoutCause, "Instance", "CreateInstanceV2")
               }
               return cutil.NewAPIError(http.StatusInternalServerError, "Instance create workflow timed out", nil)
           }
           // ... non-timeout error paths ...
       }
       return nil
   })
   // The wrapping `if err != nil` ensures real tx-helper errors (commit /
   // rollback failures that wrap into something other than the cutil.APIError
   // marker we returned for the timeout case) are surfaced via HandleTxError,
   // while the timeout-case APIError falls through to the timeoutResp call.
   if err != nil {
       var apiErr *cutil.APIError
       if !errors.As(err, &apiErr) || timeoutResp == nil {
           return common.HandleTxError(c, logger, err, "Failed to create Instance, DB transaction error")
       }
   }
   if timeoutResp != nil {
       return timeoutResp()
   }
   ```

   Notes:
   - `common.TerminateWorkflowOnTimeOut` replaces ~12 lines of inline
     `stc.TerminateWorkflow` + manual context boilerplate. Always prefer it.
   - **Pass the literal workflow name** (the exact string used in
     `stc.ExecuteWorkflow`), not a shortened action label. The helper uses
     it in logs and the termination reason, so `"CreateInstanceV2"` —
     not `"Create"` — is what should be there.
   - **Capture the timeout error explicitly** (`timeoutCause := wferr`)
     before the closure literal. The closure-scoped variable usually
     preserves the right value due to Go's per-iteration scoping, but the
     explicit capture documents intent and is resilient to future
     refactors that rename or move things around.
6. **Error returns inside vs. outside the closure.** Inside, return
   `cutil.NewAPIError(code, msg, data)` — `common.HandleTxError` translates
   it to a response after the tx unwinds. Outside (post-`WithTx`), return
   `cutil.NewAPIErrorResponse(c, code, msg, data)` directly. When moving a
   read out of the closure, the error path's constructor needs to flip too.
7. **Don't leak raw DB errors to clients.** Pass `nil` (not the underlying
   `derr`) as the `data` argument of `cutil.NewAPIError` /
   `cutil.NewAPIErrorResponse`. Log the underlying error with the contextual
   `logger` so it lands in server logs without ending up in the response
   payload.
8. **Split assign-and-condition into two statements.** Prefer

   ```go
   derr := someDAO.Action(ctx, tx, ...)
   if derr != nil {
       logger.Error().Err(derr).Msg("...")
       return cutil.NewAPIError(http.StatusInternalServerError, "...", nil)
   }
   ```

   over `if derr := someDAO.Action(...); derr != nil { ... }`. This is a
   reviewer preference applied consistently across the codebase — the
   wider scope on the error variable is a feature, not a bug, and the two
   statements read more cleanly than the combined form.

The Instance handlers (`api/pkg/api/handler/instance.go`) cover rules 1–8
end-to-end across Create/Update/Reboot/Delete and serve as the most
complete reference. SSH Key Group's Create handler is the cleanest example
of rule 3 (validation reads hoisted out of the tx). NVLink Logical
Partition's Delete handler shows the rule 5 `timeoutResp`-gating pattern
in its simplest form.

### Bulk updates must not clobber omitted (PATCH-preserved) columns

`UpdateMultiple`-style DAOs build one shared column list and apply it to every
row in a single bulk `UPDATE`. Any column added to that shared `columnsSet` is
written for **every** row in the batch — including rows whose input omitted the
field, which carry the model's zero value. For a field whose API contract is
"omitting it preserves the existing value" (PATCH semantics), folding it into
the shared set silently clears the stored value on untouched rows in a mixed
batch.

When adding such a field to a bulk-update DAO:

- Do **not** add it to the shared `columnsSet`.
- Apply it only to rows that provided it (carry per-row presence through the SQL
  shape), or split the batch by identical column set. For flat JSONB
  patch-style structs, prefer the Site config pattern:
  `column = column || ?::jsonb`; an empty object is a no-op and future fields
  can be partial-patched without replacing the whole stored object.
- Keep create vs. update straight: on create, an omitted optional field is
  stored as its zero/empty value; on update, an omitted field must be left
  untouched.
- Add a mixed-batch test: some rows set the field, others omit it, and assert
  the omitted rows keep their prior value.

`ExpectedMachine.UpdateMultiple` (`db/pkg/db/model/expectedmachine.go`) applies
`bmc_ip_address` this way for a scalar value and `host_lifecycle_profile` for a
JSONB patch; their mixed-batch tests are the guards.

## Git Workflow

When writing git commit messages, follow the conventions below:

- Use `git mv` to move files already checked into git.
- Explain non-obvious trade-offs in the commit message.
- Wrap prose (not code) to match git commit conventions; follow semantic
  commit conventions for the title (e.g. `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`).
- Use backticks for types or short code snippets; use indented code blocks
  for full lines of code.

## Code Style Preferences

- Document when you have intentionally omitted code that the reader might
  otherwise expect to be present.
- Add TODO comments for features or nuances not important to implement
  right away.
- In Go, split variable assignment and the condition into separate lines.
  Do not use initializer clauses such as if err := operation(); err != nil

## Commit Guidelines

All commits **must** meet the following signing requirement:

- **DCO sign-off** — certifies the Developer Certificate of Origin:

  ```bash
  git commit -s -m "Your commit message"
  ```

  DCO compliance is enforced automatically; unsigned commits block merging.

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Write PR descriptions as if the audience has no context: explain the *why*.
- Reference related issues.
- Keep PRs focused on a single change.
- Do not land unused code unless the PR is too large to review otherwise.
- Ensure all CI checks pass before requesting review.
- Before requesting review for a Go change, run `make lint-go` and inspect its
  complete analyzer output. Its `golangci-lint` command uses
  `--issues-exit-code 0`, so a successful command does not mean the output is
  clean. Run `go tool golangci-lint run` with the changed Go package patterns
  as arguments, without that override, and fix every finding in those packages.
- When CLI flags override configuration, copy the complete configured object
  first and overlay only explicitly set flags. Test no override, one override,
  and unset configured fields so unrelated options cannot be discarded.
- Before using an authentication or protocol convenience API, read its current
  documentation for protocol-specific encoding rules. Exercise delimiters,
  percent signs, plus signs, and other reserved characters through the real
  encode and decode boundary.
- Before requesting review, group every changed Go function's scenarios under
  one table-driven top-level test. Treat scenario-specific top-level tests as a
  review failure even when the test suite passes.

## CI / CD

The primary CI workflow (`.github/workflows/main-build.yml`) runs on pushes
to `main`, `feat/**`, `fix/**`, `chore/**`, `hotfix/**`, `version/**`,
and `pull-request/[0-9]+` branches, as well as `v*.*.*` tags and manual
`workflow_dispatch`. It performs:

- Style checks (`go fmt`, `revive`, `go vet`)
- Lint (`golangci-lint`)
- OpenAPI spec validation
- Generated files check
- Test matrix across all modules (with PostgreSQL service container)
- Binary builds (api, workflow, migrations, sitemgr, credsmgr, site-agent)
- Security scanning (TruffleHog)
- Docker image builds and pushes
- Helm chart validation
- Release promotion
