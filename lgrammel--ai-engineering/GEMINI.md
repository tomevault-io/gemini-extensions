# Agent Instructions

This repository is a lightweight knowledge workspace about [AI engineering](./concepts/ai-engineering.md) in practice. Each note captures a concept, role, or practice in a concise, definition-first format, covering what matters when building, integrating, and operating AI-powered systems on top of foundation models, and how they behave in production.

## Scope

The focus is AI engineering - the application layer of building with foundation models. ML engineering concepts (model training, data curation, architecture design) are out of scope: reference them with brief context where needed, but do not define them in depth. When an ML concept is relevant, link to it or provide a minimal description sufficient for an AI engineering audience.

## Repository structure

This is a pnpm monorepo. Content directories live at the root; tooling lives under `apps/`.

| Directory          | Contains                                                                                     | Canonical for                      |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `apps/explorer/`   | SvelteKit static site for browsing notes, graph visualization, and search                    | Knowledge base browser             |
| `apps/lint/`       | TypeScript markdown linting and validation scripts (linting only, not general build tooling) | Custom lint tooling                |
| `example-systems/` | Analyses of concrete AI systems as compositions of concepts                                  | Trust analysis of real systems     |
| `concepts/`        | Core term definitions (e.g. [LLMs](./concepts/llm.md), evals, fine-tuning)                   | Terminology and definitions        |
| `ideas/`           | Speculative/emerging ideas, optionally attributed to external sources                        | Opinion-driven or unproven ideas   |
| `threats/`         | AI agent threat descriptions (e.g. context poisoning, tool misuse)                           | Attack vectors and vulnerabilities |

Don't invent definitions in-line. If one is missing or unclear, **add or update a note** in the appropriate directory, then use it.

Treat notes as a living glossary: update entries as understanding changes.

## Writing notes

All note types (concept, idea, threat, example system) share these conventions. Type-specific rules follow in later sections.

### Naming

- **File name**: kebab-case (e.g. `ai-gateway.md`)
- **Title**: `# Term Name` on line 1, matching the primary term
- Avoid near-duplicate names (e.g. "AI Observability" vs "Observability Tools") unless scope intentionally differs

### Template

```markdown
# Term Name

A 1-2 sentence definition (executive summary).

## Details

Optional additional context: typical behaviors, scope, or how it works in practice.

## Examples

- Concrete examples if helpful.

## Synonyms

synonym1, synonym2.

## External references

- https://example.com/source
```

**Required:** title + executive summary (1-2 sentences immediately after title). The executive summary is the first paragraph after the H1 and stands alone as a useful definition of the term.

**Optional sections** (include only when they add significant value, in this order):

- `## Details` - additional context paragraphs when the executive summary alone is insufficient (scope, boundaries, how it works in practice, `Note:` clarifications). Omit this section when the executive summary fully covers the term.
- `## Examples` - concrete instances
- `## Synonyms` - plain text only, no links
- `## External references` - external URLs only; include only references you actually fetched and used

### What to avoid

- `Why it matters:` or `See also:` sections - fold relevance into the definition; use inline links instead of link lists.
- Unverified references or generic link lists (e.g. a standalone "Related concepts:" sentence).
- Prescriptive language in the main section ("should", "must", "do X", "avoid Y"). Phrase operationally as description ("common practice is...") or put guidance under `## Examples`.

### Linking and deduplication

- **One canonical note per idea.** Before creating a file, check for an existing note under a synonym; if found, update it and add the synonym under `## Synonyms`.
- **Link, don't duplicate.** Reference other notes with relative links (e.g. `[LLM](./concepts/llm.md)`) rather than restating definitions.
- **Update related notes** when changing a definition or scope.
- **Cross-link** to relevant concept, threat, and idea notes where it aids understanding.
- Keep each directory's `index.md` sorted alphabetically by visible name.

### Concise but complete

A note is "complete" when a reader can understand the term without guessing key scope details. A good note typically covers:

- What it is (core definition - in the executive summary)
- Where it applies (scope)
- Key boundary or distinction (what it's not)
- If relevant, the most important variants (kept minimal)

**Executive summary.** The executive summary defines _what_ the concept is. `## Details` explains _how_ it works, _where_ it applies in detail, and _what_ distinguishes it from adjacent concepts. The summary names mechanisms at most - it does not explain them. Test: a reader who sees only the executive summary can answer what the term is, roughly where it applies, and how it differs from the most closely related concept. If parsing the summary requires understanding mechanisms or implementation details, move those to Details. If a single sentence needs multiple subordinate clauses, split into two - prefer a crisp first sentence that names the concept and its category, followed by a second that adds the key differentiator or scope.

**Details paragraphs.** Each paragraph in `## Details` should serve a recognizable purpose:

- _Mechanism_ - how it works at the level an AI engineer needs (not ML internals, not tutorial-level)
- _Distinction_ - how it differs from the most commonly confused or adjacent concept
- _Scope/boundaries_ - where it applies, where it doesn't
- _Variants_ - important sub-types or implementation strategies when they differ meaningfully
- _Trust/security_ - when the concept creates a specific attack surface or has defining security properties

The first sentence of Details should advance beyond the executive summary, not echo it. Structure paragraphs so the reader understands why each follows from what precedes it - the most important expansion (typically mechanism or key distinction) comes first. If a paragraph makes more than 3-4 distinct claims, consider splitting it. If a paragraph primarily enumerates related concepts, either explain why each connection matters to the reader or convert it to a list under an H3 subsection - a sentence linking to 5+ concepts without explaining their relevance needs restructuring. A paragraph that exists mainly to note where the concept appears ("X is used in Y, Z, and W") should either reveal a non-obvious insight about those connections or be folded into the paragraph where the connection naturally arises.

Include trust or security implications when they are defining characteristics of the concept or when it creates a specific attack surface. Place security content at the end of Details unless it is the concept's primary concern. Link to threat notes rather than repeating threat definitions.

Go deep enough that an AI engineer could evaluate a tradeoff or make a build-vs-buy decision. Stop before the note becomes a tutorial or requires ML-internal knowledge to follow.

**H3 subsections.** Use `###` subsections under `## Details` when a concept has distinct named sub-concepts too substantial for inline mention but not significant enough for their own note. If a variant or sub-type needs more than 2-3 sentences, it likely warrants a subsection.

### Conceptual boundaries

When defining or reviewing a concept, verify that every mechanism or property attributed to it actually belongs to that concept - not to a related but distinct one. Key test: if concept A is defined partly by contrast with concept B (e.g. workflows vs agents), the definition of A should not use primitives that are specific to B. For example, "tools" describes LLM-chosen actions in an agent loop; workflows use developer-defined programmatic logic, not tool invocations.

### Prose style

Every sentence must add new information.

- **No origin stories or etymology.** Just use the term directly.
- **No inline attribution.** The `## External references` section handles sourcing.
- **No redundant restatements.** Each paragraph should advance the idea, not echo the previous one.
- **Compress repeated patterns.** Merge items that make the same structural point into one tighter statement with inline examples.
- **No filler analogies** unless essential to understanding.
- **Keep examples distinct.** Each example should illustrate a different facet, not repeat the same point with different nouns.

## Concept notes

Concept notes live in `concepts/` and define core terms. Keep them **concise**, **complete**, **definition-first**, and **linked** to related concepts. All concept notes start with an executive summary paragraph, followed by an optional `## Details` section for additional context.

The main section is **descriptive only**: it explains what the term is, how it behaves, and where it applies. If operational guidance is important, phrase it descriptively or put concrete instances under `## Examples`.

ML engineering concepts (e.g. training, pretraining, reinforcement learning, transformer architecture) may be included as brief reference notes when AI engineering notes link to them. Keep these to an executive summary and minimal `## Details`; deep ML mechanics (training loop internals, architectural variants, optimization algorithms) can be omitted.

## Idea notes

Idea notes live in `ideas/` and capture speculative, emerging, or opinion-driven ideas from specific external sources. They follow concept note conventions (including the executive summary + optional `## Details` structure) with these additions:

- The main section **may use analytical and speculative language** ("the idea that...", "this suggests...", "this creates a potential...").
- `## Counterarguments` is an optional section listing the strongest objections or limitations as bullet points. Place it after `## Examples` and before `## Confidence`. Counterarguments should be substantive and specific rather than generic disclaimers.
- `## Confidence` is a required section with a one-word confidence label (**High**, **Medium**, or **Low**) followed by a 1-3 sentence explanation. It synthesizes the idea's strength considering the counterarguments and available evidence. **High**: strong evidence, practically demonstrated, counterarguments do not undermine the core thesis. **Medium**: plausible and useful but with significant open questions or strong counterarguments that limit scope. **Low**: speculative, counterarguments may outweigh the thesis, or limited to narrow applicability. Place it after `## Counterarguments` and before `## Synonyms` / `## External references`.
- `## External references` is optional. When present, every listed source must have been actually read.

## Threat notes

Threat notes live in `threats/` and describe attack vectors, vulnerabilities, or adversarial behaviors targeting AI agents. They follow concept note conventions (including the executive summary + optional `## Details` structure) with these additions:

- `## Mitigations` is an optional section listing countermeasures as bullet points with links to relevant notes. Place it after `## Examples` and before `## Synonyms` / `## External references`.

## Example system notes

Example system notes live in `example-systems/` and analyze concrete AI products or well-known product categories as compositions of concepts. They show how building blocks combine in real systems and what trust model emerges from each specific composition. They differ from concept notes (which define vocabulary and individual trust properties) by focusing on how capabilities interact when composed together.

Example system notes reference concepts as building blocks (link, don't duplicate). Each system is described by the capabilities it composes and the trust model that results. Trust implications of individual capabilities belong in concept notes; example system notes focus on how the specific composition creates its trust model and what interaction effects emerge.

Example system notes follow concept note conventions (including the executive summary + optional `## Details` structure) with these additions:

- `## Capabilities` is a required section listing the system's capabilities as a bulleted list of links to concept notes. Place it after the executive summary (or after `## Details` if present).
- `## Trust analysis` is a required section with prose analysis of the system's specific trust model - how the capabilities compose, where the boundaries are, what is unique to this composition. Reference threat notes inline where relevant rather than maintaining a separate exhaustive threat list. Place it after `## Capabilities`.
- `## Interaction effects` is a required section describing emergent risks from the specific combination of capabilities that are not captured by any single capability in isolation. Place it after `## Trust analysis`.
- `## Threats` is a required section listing all applicable threats as a table with three columns: Threat (linked name), Relevance (`Primary` / `Elevated` / `Standard`), and Note (brief architecture-specific phrase). **Primary**: defining threat for this architecture, uniquely amplified by or central to this specific composition of capabilities. **Elevated**: meaningfully present due to the system's capabilities, beyond baseline foundation model risk. **Standard**: baseline risk present in any LLM system, no architecture-specific amplifier. Notes are short phrases, not full sentences. Threats already discussed in `## Trust analysis` or `## Interaction effects` need only a brief pointer, not a full re-explanation. Place it after `## Interaction effects`.
- `## Examples` is an optional section for generic category notes (e.g., "Enterprise RAG Chatbot") to list concrete product instances. Named product notes (e.g., "Cursor") typically do not need this section. Place it after `## Threats`.

## Explorer app

`apps/explorer/` is a SvelteKit static site that renders the repository's notes as a browsable web app. It reads markdown files from `concepts/`, `ideas/`, `threats/`, and `example-systems/` at build time and pre-renders all pages using `@sveltejs/adapter-static`.

### Tech stack

SvelteKit v2 with Svelte 5 (runes), Vite, TypeScript, marked (markdown rendering), and D3.js (graph visualization). Hand-written CSS with `prefers-color-scheme` dark mode support.

### Pages

- `/` - dashboard with category cards and note counts
- `/[category]` - alphabetical note list for a category
- `/[category]/[slug]` - rendered markdown note with resolved links
- `/graph` - interactive D3 force-directed graph of all notes and their cross-references
- `/search` - client-side BM25 full-text search (`Cmd+K` shortcut)

### Key modules

| File                       | Purpose                                                         |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `src/lib/content.ts`       | Reads `.md` files from the repo root at build time              |
| `src/lib/graph.ts`         | Builds node/edge graph from internal cross-references           |
| `src/lib/markdown.ts`      | Renders markdown to HTML, rewrites relative links to app routes |
| `src/lib/search.ts`        | BM25 search over the pre-built index                            |
| `src/lib/tokenize.ts`      | Shared tokenizer (used by indexer and client-side search)       |
| `scripts/index-content.ts` | Generates `static/search-index.json` from markdown content      |

### Running

- **Dev server**: `pnpm dev` (from `apps/explorer/`; run `pnpm index-content` first to generate the search index)
- **Build**: `pnpm build` (generates search index, then produces static HTML)
- **Index content**: `pnpm index-content` (regenerate `static/search-index.json`)
- **Preview**: `pnpm preview`
- **Type check**: `pnpm check`

Content resolution depends on the repo root being two levels up from `apps/explorer/`.

## Tools

Pre-commit hooks run automatically on staged files. Run `pnpm install` to set up.

### Code formatting (Prettier)

Auto-formats markdown, JavaScript, TypeScript, and JSON files.

- **Format all files**: `pnpm format`
- **Check formatting**: `pnpm format:check`
- **Config**: `.prettierrc`

Prettier runs first in the pre-commit hook and auto-fixes formatting issues.

### Markdown linting (markdownlint)

Enforces consistent markdown structure and style.

- **Manual check**: `pnpm lint:md <file.md>` or `pnpm lint:md concepts/`
- **Config**: `.markdownlint.jsonc`

### Typography rules (check-quotes)

Enforces plain ASCII characters for consistency and tooling compatibility.

| Don't use                       | Use instead               |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Curly double quotes             | `"` (straight quote)      |
| Curly single quotes/apostrophes | `'` (straight apostrophe) |
| Em dash                         | `-`                       |
| En dash                         | `-`                       |
| Ellipsis character              | `...`                     |

- **Manual check**: `pnpm check-quotes <file.md>`
- **Script**: `apps/lint/scripts/check-quotes.ts`

### Structure checking (check-structure)

Validates note structure against type-specific rules: kebab-case filenames, H1 title on line 1, executive summary present, correct section ordering, no unexpected sections, H3 subsections only under Details, no links in Synonyms, and external-only URLs in External references.

- **Check all files**: `pnpm check-structure`
- **Manual check**: `pnpm check-structure <file.md>`
- **Script**: `apps/lint/scripts/check-structure.ts`

### Link checking (check-links)

Validates markdown links (both relative and external). Only dead links are reported, with file path, URL, and HTTP status.

- **Check all files**: `pnpm check-links`
- **Manual check**: `pnpm check-links <file.md>`
- **Script**: `apps/lint/scripts/check-links.ts`
- **Config**: `.markdown-link-check.json` (timeouts, retries, ignored patterns)

### TypeScript checking (check-types)

Runs type checks on both the explorer app (`svelte-kit sync` + `svelte-check`) and the lint app (`tsc --noEmit`).

- **Check types**: `pnpm check-types`

### Index checking (check-indexes)

Validates that each directory index (`example-systems/index.md`, `concepts/index.md`, `ideas/index.md`, `threats/index.md`) lists all `.md` files in that directory (excluding `index.md`) and that entries are sorted alphabetically by visible name.

- **Check all indexes**: `pnpm check-indexes`
- **Script**: `apps/lint/scripts/check-indexes.ts`
