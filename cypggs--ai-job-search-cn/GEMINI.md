## Repo Structure
- `cv/` - LaTeX CV variants (moderncv template, banking style; English/international)
- `cv/chinese/` - 中文简历模板 (ctex + moderncv)
- `cover_letters/` - LaTeX cover letters (custom cover.cls template; English/international)
- `cover_letters/chinese/` - 中文求职信模板 (ctexart)
- `.claude/skills/` - AI skill definitions for the application workflow
- `.agents/skills/` - Job search CLI tools (optional for Chinese market)

## Workflow for New Job Applications
1. User provides a job posting (URL or text)
2. Detect the target market: if the posting is in Chinese, targets a Chinese company, or uses Chinese salary conventions, treat it as a China-market application.
3. **Always evaluate fit first**: skills match, experience match, behavioral/culture match, plus China-specific factors (schedule, 五险一金, contract type). Present this assessment to the user before proceeding.
4. If good fit: create targeted CV and cover letter in the appropriate language/market:
   - China market: `cv/chinese/main_<company>.tex` + `cover_letters/chinese/cover_<company>_<role>.tex`
   - International: `cv/main_<company>.tex` + `cover_letters/cover_<company>_<role>.tex`
5. **Verify both documents** (see Verification Checklist below)
6. Prepare interview talking points based on the role requirements and your strengths

**Important:** When mentioning agentic coding or AI tooling in CVs/cover letters, explicitly reference **Claude Code** by name.

## Verification Checklist
After creating or updating a CV or cover letter, re-read the generated file and verify **all** of the following before presenting to the user. Report the results as a pass/fail checklist.

### Factual accuracy
- [ ] All claims match actual profile (CLAUDE.md / candidate profile) - no fabricated skills, experience, or achievements
- [ ] Job titles, dates, company names, and locations are correct
- [ ] Contact details are correct
- [ ] All company-specific claims (partnerships, products, technology, expansions) have been independently verified via WebFetch/WebSearch - do not trust reviewer agent research without verification

### Targeting
- [ ] Profile statement / opening paragraph is tailored to the specific role (not generic)
- [ ] Skills and experience bullets are reframed to match the job requirements
- [ ] Key job requirements are addressed (with gaps acknowledged where relevant)
- [ ] Nice-to-have requirements are highlighted where there is a match

### Consistency
- [ ] CV follows the standard 2-page moderncv/banking format (or the 2-page Chinese moderncv+ctex format for China-market roles)
- [ ] Cover letter uses the correct template: `cover.cls` for English/Danish, `cover_letters/chinese/cover.tex` structure for Chinese
- [ ] Tone is consistent across CV and cover letter
- [ ] No contradictions between CV and cover letter content

### Quality
- [ ] No LaTeX syntax errors (balanced braces, correct commands)
- [ ] No spelling or grammar errors
- [ ] Agentic coding / AI tooling references mention **Claude Code** by name
- [ ] Cover letter is addressed to the correct person (or "Dear Hiring Manager" / "尊敬的招聘负责人" if unknown)
- [ ] Cover letter fits approximately one page

### Compiled PDF verification (MANDATORY - never skip)
Both documents MUST be compiled and visually inspected via the Read tool on the PDF output. "Looks fine in the .tex" is not acceptable - LaTeX page-break decisions are unpredictable. Iterate until these all pass:
- [ ] CV compiled with **lualatex** for default templates, or **lualatex/xelatex** for Chinese templates (pdflatex often fails on modern MiKTeX with fontawesome5 font-expansion errors; Chinese templates require lualatex/xelatex for `ctex`). Cover letter compiled with **xelatex** for default templates, or **xelatex/lualatex** for Chinese templates.
- [ ] **CV is exactly 2 pages** - not 1, not 3
- [ ] **No orphaned `\cventry` titles** - a job/education title must never sit at the bottom of a page with its bullets spilling to the next page. Use `\needspace{5\baselineskip}` before each `\cventry` to prevent this, and `\enlargethispage{2-3\baselineskip}` to rescue a trailing section that just barely spills
- [ ] **Cover letter is exactly 1 page** - signature block must fit with the body, never overflow
- [ ] **For default cover letter: bullet font matches body font** - `\lettercontent{}` must not wrap `\begin{itemize}...\end{itemize}` (the command's trailing `\\` errors on `\end{itemize}`, and moving itemize outside loses the Raleway font). Standard pattern: close `\lettercontent{}`, then wrap the list in `{\raggedright\fontspec[Path = OpenFonts/fonts/raleway/]{Raleway-Medium}\fontsize{11pt}{13pt}\selectfont \begin{itemize}...\end{itemize}\par}`
- [ ] **For Chinese cover letter: Chinese characters render clearly, no tofu boxes or font fallback issues; Chinese cover letters use the `cover_letters/chinese/cover.tex` structure**

### ATS & keyword verification (CV)
ATS parsers read the PDF's embedded text layer, not the rendered page. Extract it with `pdftotext -layout` and verify what a parser sees. `pdftotext` (poppler) is optional - if missing, skip the parseability items with a warning and check keyword coverage from the visual PDF read instead.
- [ ] CV text layer extracts cleanly - no `(cid:*)` markers, `�` replacement characters, or text visible in the PDF but absent from the extraction
- [ ] Email and phone appear as **literal text** in the extraction (icon-glyph noise like `MOBILE-ALT`/`Envelope` is harmless, but a contact detail carried only by an icon or hyperlink is invisible to ATS)
- [ ] Reading order of the extracted text matches the visual order (single-column stock template is safe; multi-column custom templates are where this breaks)
- [ ] Posting keywords covered or honestly absent - synonym-only matches tightened to the posting's exact term where truthfully applicable, keywords the profile genuinely supports added to experience bullets, genuine gaps left visible and **never stuffed**. For Chinese postings, verify that Chinese role titles, technical terms, and company names extract cleanly.
