# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Merlina is a magical LLM training system with support for ORPO, DPO, SimPO, CPO, IPO, KTO, and SFT training modes. It provides a delightful wizard-themed web interface for fine-tuning language models with LoRA adapters. The system supports flexible dataset loading from multiple sources and automatic chat template formatting.

**New in v1.3:**
- **Messages Format Support**: Automatic detection and conversion of common chat dataset format with multi-turn conversation support

**New in v1.2:**
- **SFT Mode**: Train with only chosen responses (rejected field not required)
- Dynamic UI that adapts based on selected training mode

**New in v1.1:**
- Persistent job storage with SQLite database
- Real-time WebSocket updates during training
- Pre-flight validation to catch errors before training
- Detailed metrics tracking and history
- Support for both HuggingFace model IDs and local model directories
- Private/public repository control for HuggingFace Hub uploads

## Project Spirit

Merlina is designed to make LLM fine-tuning approachable and delightful, not intimidating. The entire project is themed around a cute anime magician girl who guides you through the training process with charm and style.

The philosophy is simple: **powerful ML training shouldn't require arcane command-line incantations or PhD-level expertise**. Whether you're a researcher experimenting with preference optimization or a hobbyist trying to make your first fine-tuned model, Merlina welcomes you with a friendly interface, clear feedback, and magical animations.

Behind the whimsical wizard theme is a carefully architected system that handles the complex stuff (dataset formatting, memory management, quantization, GPU optimization) so you can focus on what matters: creating better models. The UI is playful, but the engineering is serious.

**Key principles:**
- **Approachable**: No config files to edit, no command-line arguments to memorize
- **Visual**: See your datasets, preview formatting, watch training progress in real-time
- **Safe**: Pre-flight checks catch errors before wasting GPU time
- **Flexible**: Support for multiple dataset sources, formats, and model types
- **Delightful**: Smooth animations, clear status updates, and a touch of magic

When working on Merlina, preserve this spirit. Keep the code clean and well-documented, but remember that the end goal is to make someone smile while they train their model.

## Development Commands

python tests/test_pipeline.py
python tests/test_api_endpoints.py
```

### Installing Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Version Management

Merlina uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (SemVer) for version control: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`

**Version Files:**
- `version.py` - Single source of truth for version information
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Detailed change history following [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/)

**Bumping Versions:**
```bash
# Preview changes without applying
python bump_version.py [major|minor|patch] --dry-run

# Bump patch version (1.2.0 -> 1.2.1) for bug fixes
python bump_version.py patch

# Bump minor version (1.2.0 -> 1.3.0) for new features
python bump_version.py minor

# Bump major version (1.2.0 -> 2.0.0) for breaking changes
python bump_version.py major

# Add a release name
python bump_version.py minor --release-name "Feature Name"
```

**What the bump script does:**
1. Updates `version.py` with new version and release date
2. Adds new version section to `CHANGELOG.md`
3. Creates git tag (e.g., `v1.3.0`)
4. Provides next steps for committing and pushing

**Semantic Versioning Rules:**
- **MAJOR (X.0.0)**: Breaking changes, incompatible API changes
  - Example: Removing endpoints, changing data formats, incompatible config changes
- **MINOR (1.X.0)**: New features, backwards-compatible additions
  - Example: New training modes, additional API endpoints, new UI features
- **PATCH (1.2.X)**: Bug fixes, backwards-compatible fixes
  - Example: Bug fixes, performance improvements, documentation updates

**Version Visibility:**
- API exposes version at `GET /version` endpoint
- Frontend displays version in footer (auto-loaded on page load)
- FastAPI docs show version in OpenAPI spec
- Logs include version on startup

**Release Process:**
1. Ensure all changes are committed
2. Run `python bump_version.py [type]` to bump version
3. Edit `CHANGELOG.md` to fill in the changes for the new version
4. Commit: `git commit -am "Bump version to X.Y.Z"`
5. Push: `git push origin <branch>`
6. Push tag: `git push origin vX.Y.Z`
7. Create GitHub release from tag with CHANGELOG excerpt

**Current Version:** See `version.py` or run `python -c "from version import __version__; print(__version__)"`

## Code Architecture

### Core Components

**Backend (merlina.py)**
- FastAPI application serving REST API and static frontend
- Main entry point for the application
- Integrates all modules from `src/` and `dataset_handlers/`
- Background task execution using FastAPI BackgroundTasks

**Source Modules (src/)**
- `job_manager.py` - SQLite persistence for jobs and metrics
- `websocket_manager.py` - Real-time WebSocket connections
- `preflight_checks.py` - Configuration validation
- `training_runner.py` - Enhanced training with callbacks
- `job_queue.py` - Job queue with priority and concurrency control

**Dataset Handling Module (dataset_handlers/)**

The dataset system uses a modular strategy pattern with three main abstractions:

1. **DatasetLoader** (base.py, loaders.py)
   - Abstract base class for loading strategies
   - Implementations: `HuggingFaceLoader`, `LocalFileLoader`, `UploadedDatasetLoader`
   - Each loader handles a specific source type (HF Hub, local files, uploaded content)

2. **DatasetFormatter** (base.py, formatters.py)
   - Abstract base class for formatting strategies
   - Implementations: `ChatMLFormatter`, `Llama3Formatter`, `MistralFormatter`, `CustomFormatter`, `TokenizerFormatter`
   - `TokenizerFormatter` is special - it uses the model's native chat template from tokenizer_config.json
   - Factory function `get_formatter()` creates appropriate formatter instances

3. **DatasetPipeline** (base.py)
   - Orchestrates loading, validation, formatting, and train/test splitting
   - Provides `preview()` for raw data and `preview_formatted()` for formatted samples
   - Handles column mapping to standardize dataset schemas
   - Automatically detects and converts "messages" format datasets (see messages_converter.py)
   - Main interface: `prepare()` returns (train_dataset, eval_dataset)

4. **Messages Format Converter** (messages_converter.py) - New in v1.3
   - Utilities for converting common "messages" format to standard Merlina format
   - Functions: `has_messages_format()`, `convert_messages_to_standard()`, `convert_messages_dataset()`
   - Automatically invoked by DatasetPipeline when messages format is detected and `convert_messages_format=True`
   - Can be toggled on/off via UI checkbox or API parameter

**Frontend (frontend/)**
- Pure HTML/CSS/JS interface (no build step)
- Wizard theme with animations
- Dataset configuration UI with live preview capabilities
- Real-time job status polling

### Key Design Patterns

- **Strategy Pattern**: Interchangeable loaders and formatters
- **Factory Pattern**: `get_formatter()` creates formatter instances
- **Facade Pattern**: `DatasetPipeline` simplifies complex dataset operations
- **Dependency Injection**: Pipeline receives loader and formatter instances

### Dataset Schema

All datasets must have these columns after loading and column mapping:
- `prompt` (required) - User input/question
- `chosen` (required) - Preferred response
- `rejected` (required for ORPO, not used in SFT) - Non-preferred response
- `system` (optional) - System message
- `reasoning` (optional) - Reasoning/thinking process (used by Qwen3 format)

Formatters transform these into chat-formatted strings with proper special tokens.

**Training Mode Requirements**:
- **ORPO Mode**: Requires all three fields (`prompt`, `chosen`, `rejected`) for preference optimization
- **SFT Mode**: Only uses `prompt` and `chosen` fields. The `rejected` field is ignored if present.

**Reasoning Field**: When using the Qwen3 format, if a `reasoning` column is present, it will be wrapped in `<think>` tags and prepended to both the chosen and rejected responses. This allows training models with explicit reasoning steps.

**Messages Format Support** (New in v1.3):

Merlina now automatically detects and converts datasets in the common "messages" format used by many chat datasets:

```json
{
  "messages": [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Hello"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hi there!"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "How are you?"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "I'm doing well!"}
  ]
}
```

**Conversion Logic**:
- System messages are extracted into the `system` field
- All user messages are combined into the `prompt` field (multi-turn conversations separated by double newlines)
- All assistant messages are combined into the `chosen` field (multi-turn responses separated by double newlines)
- The conversion happens automatically after loading and before column mapping (when enabled)
- Best suited for **SFT mode** since the format doesn't include rejected responses
- **Can be toggled on/off**: In the UI, when inspecting dataset columns, if a "messages" column is detected, a toggle checkbox appears to enable/disable automatic conversion
- API parameter: `convert_messages_format` (default: `true`) in DatasetConfig

**Example Conversion**:
```python
# Input (messages format)
{"messages": [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Who developed you?"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "I'm a language model finetuned by Schneewolf Labs."}
]}

# Output (standard format)
{
    "prompt": "Who developed you?",
    "chosen": "I'm a language model finetuined by Schneewolf Labs.",
    "system": ""
}
```

**Multi-turn Example**:
```python
# Input (multi-turn messages)
{"messages": [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Hello"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hi!"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "How are you?"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Great!"}
]}

# Output (combined)
{
    "prompt": "Hello\n\nHow are you?",
    "chosen": "Hi!\n\nGreat!",
    "system": ""
}
```

The messages format is automatically detected and converted with no additional configuration required. Simply load your dataset and Merlina will handle the conversion transparently.

### Model Loading

Merlina supports loading models from two sources:

**1. HuggingFace Hub** (default)
- Use standard HuggingFace model IDs: `"meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct"`
- Format: `organization/model-name`
- Automatically downloads models from huggingface.co
- Gated models (like Llama) require `hf_token` in configuration

**2. Local Directory Paths**
- Use absolute paths: `"/home/user/models/my-llama-model"`
- Use relative paths: `"./models/my-model"` or `"../models/my-model"`
- Model directory must contain required files (config.json, model weights)
- Useful for pre-downloaded models or custom fine-tuned models

**Path Detection Logic** (see `src/preflight_checks.py:is_local_model_path()`)
- Paths starting with `/`, `./`, or `../` are treated as local
- Paths with multiple slashes (e.g., `models/sub/folder`) are treated as local
- Paths with backslashes (Windows) are treated as local
- Existing directories with model files (config.json, *.safetensors) are treated as local
- Format `org/model` with single slash is treated as HuggingFace ID

**Pre-flight Validation**:
- Local paths: Validates directory exists and contains config.json
- HuggingFace models: Checks for gated models and required tokens
- Both: Automatically detected via `is_local_model_path()` function

### Model Type Detection (VLM Support)

Merlina supports both text-only LLMs and vision-language models (VLMs). The `model_type` configuration parameter controls which AutoModel class is used for loading:

- **`auto`** (default): Auto-detects by checking the model's config for `vision_config` or VLM architecture patterns (`ForConditionalGeneration`, `ForVision`, `ImageText`). Works for most models.
- **`causal_lm`**: Forces `AutoModelForCausalLM` (text-only LLM).
- **`vlm`**: Forces `AutoModelForVision2Seq` (vision-language model). Use this for models like Qwen-VL, LLaVA, etc. to preserve vision capabilities.

**Why this matters**: Using `AutoModelForCausalLM` on a VLM (e.g., `Qwen3_5ForConditionalGeneration`) causes transformers to load the text-only variant (`Qwen3_5ForCausalLM`), stripping vision components.

**Implementation**: `_detect_is_vlm()` and `_get_auto_model_class()` in `src/training_runner.py`. Both model loading (for training) and model reloading (for LoRA merge before upload) use the correct class.

### Job Queue System (v1.1)

Jobs are managed through a priority queue system with configurable concurrency:

**Job States:**
- `queued` - Job waiting in queue for execution
- `running`/`initializing`/`loading_model`/`loading_dataset`/`training` - Job executing
- `completed` - Job finished successfully
- `failed` - Job failed with error
- `stopped` - Job stopped by user request
- `cancelled` - Job cancelled while in queue

**Queue Features:**
- Priority levels: LOW, NORMAL, HIGH (higher priority jobs run first)
- Configurable max concurrent jobs (default: 1)
- Thread-safe job management with worker threads
- Automatic queue processing
- Job cancellation support (queued or running)
- Queue position tracking

**Configuration:**
- `MAX_CONCURRENT_JOBS` in `.env` (default: 1)
- Set to 1 for single GPU to prevent OOM
- Increase for multi-GPU systems with sufficient VRAM

**Key Classes:**
- `JobQueue` (src/job_queue.py) - Main queue manager
- `QueuedJob` - Represents a job in the queue
- `JobPriority` - Enum for priority levels

### Training Modes

Merlina supports multiple training modes, selectable via the `training_mode` configuration parameter:

**1. ORPO (Odds Ratio Preference Optimization)** - Default
- Requires: `prompt`, `chosen`, and `rejected` fields
- Combines supervised learning with odds-ratio preference optimization in a single pass — no reference model needed
- Parameters: `beta`

**2. DPO (Direct Preference Optimization)**
- Requires: `prompt`, `chosen`, and `rejected` fields
- Directly optimizes the policy to prefer chosen over rejected responses using log-ratio trick
- Parameters: `beta`, `label_smoothing`

**3. SimPO (Simple Preference Optimization)**
- Requires: `prompt`, `chosen`, and `rejected` fields
- Reference-free DPO variant with length-normalized rewards and configurable margin
- Parameters: `beta`, `gamma`

**4. CPO (Contrastive Preference Optimization)**
- Requires: `prompt`, `chosen`, and `rejected` fields
- Reference-free contrastive learning on preference pairs
- Parameters: `beta`, `label_smoothing`

**5. IPO (Identity Preference Optimization)**
- Requires: `prompt`, `chosen`, and `rejected` fields
- Squared-loss variant of DPO, more robust to noisy preferences
- Parameters: `beta`

**6. KTO (Kahneman-Tversky Optimization)**
- Requires: `prompt` and `chosen` fields. `rejected` is optional.
- Uses prospect theory with unpaired binary feedback (good/bad)
- Automatically splits chosen/rejected pairs into separate positive/negative examples
- Works with SFT-style datasets (all positive) or preference datasets (split into positive/negative)
- Best for: When you have binary feedback signals or want to use preference data without strict pairing
- Parameters: `beta`

**7. SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning)**
- Requires: `prompt` and `chosen` fields only (rejected field ignored)
- Traditional supervised learning on chosen responses
- Best for: General instruction following, adapting to new tasks, style transfer
- Parameters: Does not use `beta` parameter

**Choosing a Mode**:
- Use **ORPO/DPO/SimPO/CPO/IPO** when you have paired chosen/rejected responses and want preference optimization
- Use **KTO** when you have binary feedback (thumbs up/down) or want to use preference data without strict pairing
- Use **SFT** when you only have good examples or want traditional fine-tuning

### Training Flow

1. User submits training config via POST /train with optional priority
2. Job created with unique job_id and added to queue
3. Worker thread picks up job when slot available
4. `run_training()` executes:
   - Load model and tokenizer with optional 4-bit quantization
   - Create DatasetPipeline with appropriate loader and formatter
   - Call `pipeline.prepare()` to get formatted train/eval datasets
   - Setup LoRA config (if enabled)
   - Choose trainer based on `training_mode`:
     - **Preference Modes (ORPO/DPO/SimPO/CPO/IPO)**: Tokenize chosen/rejected pairs, train with preference loss
     - **KTO Mode**: Split chosen/rejected into unpaired examples with binary labels, train with KTO loss
     - **SFT Mode**: Train with supervised fine-tuning (uses only chosen)
   - Save to ./models/{output_name}
   - Optionally merge and push to HuggingFace Hub
4. Frontend polls GET /status/{job_id} for progress updates

### API Endpoints

**Training**
- POST /train?priority=normal - Submit training job to queue (priority: low/normal/high)
- GET /status/{job_id} - Get job progress and queue status
- GET /jobs - List all jobs
- POST /jobs/{job_id}/stop - Cancel queued job or stop running job

**Queue Management**
- GET /queue/status - Get overall queue statistics and job lists
- GET /queue/jobs - List queued and running jobs with positions

**Dataset Management**
- POST /dataset/preview - Preview raw dataset (10 samples)
- POST /dataset/preview-formatted - Preview with formatting applied (5 samples)
- POST /dataset/upload-file - Upload file, returns dataset_id
- GET /dataset/uploads - List uploaded datasets

## Important Implementation Notes

### Tokenizer Format

When using `format_type: "tokenizer"`, the system automatically uses the model's native chat template from `tokenizer_config.json`. This is the recommended approach as it ensures format compatibility with the base model.

The TokenizerFormatter:
- Uses `tokenizer.apply_chat_template()` with message dictionaries
- Adds generation prompt for the prompt field
- Extracts proper suffix formatting for chosen/rejected responses
- Falls back to simple concatenation if chat_template is missing

### Memory Management

The training function includes explicit cleanup:
```python
del trainer, model
gc.collect()
torch.cuda.empty_cache()
```

This is critical for running multiple sequential training jobs.

### 4-bit Quantization

When `use_4bit=True`:
- Uses BitsAndBytesConfig with NF4 quantization
- Model prepared with `prepare_model_for_kbit_training()`
- Significantly reduces VRAM requirements (7B model: ~10GB instead of ~28GB)

### Flash Attention

Automatically enabled for GPUs with compute capability >= 8 (Ampere and newer). Falls back to "eager" attention for older GPUs.

### HuggingFace Hub Privacy Control

When pushing models to HuggingFace Hub (`push_to_hub=True`):
- `hf_hub_private=True` (default): Creates **private repository** (only you can access)
- `hf_hub_private=False`: Creates **public repository** (anyone can access)
- Both model and tokenizer are pushed with the same privacy setting
- Requires valid `hf_token` for authentication
- Repository visibility can be changed later on HuggingFace.co

**Best Practices:**
- Use private repositories for proprietary or experimental models
- Use public repositories for open-source contributions
- Never commit HF tokens to version control
- Use tokens with appropriate write permissions

## Testing Strategy

Tests are structured for independent execution (not using pytest fixtures):
- Each test file can run standalone: `python tests/test_*.py`
- Tests use `sys.path.insert(0, '/path/to/merlina')` for imports
- Fixtures stored in `tests/fixtures/` directory
- Test data: `tests/fixtures/test_dataset.json`

### Frontend Tests

Playwright-based integration tests live in `tests/frontend/` (`test_integration.spec.mjs`, `test_ui.mjs`, `test_api.mjs`, `test_validation.mjs`, `test_theme.mjs`). They drive the real UI against `serve_for_tests.py`, which mocks ML dependencies so the server can boot without torch/transformers.

**When you change anything in `frontend/` (index.html, CSS, or JS), update the corresponding frontend tests in the same change.** This includes:
- Renaming, removing, or restructuring DOM elements — update selectors in the specs
- Changing default states (what's visible/hidden on load) — update the assertions
- Reworking flows (e.g. unifying primary/additional datasets into one list) — rewrite the affected describe blocks rather than leaving them pointing at dead IDs
- Adding new user-facing behavior — add a test for it

Don't land frontend changes that leave the specs referencing IDs or classes that no longer exist. A quick `grep -rn '#old-id' tests/frontend/` before committing catches most of these.

## Common Workflows

### Adding a New Dataset Formatter

1. Create formatter class in `dataset_handlers/formatters.py`:
```python
class NewFormatter(DatasetFormatter):
    def format(self, row: dict) -> dict:
        # Transform row to chat format
        return {"prompt": ..., "chosen": ..., "rejected": ...}

    def get_format_info(self) -> dict:
        return {"format_type": "new_format", ...}
```

2. Add case to `get_formatter()` factory function
3. Update frontend dropdown in `frontend/index.html`
4. Create test in `tests/test_*.py`

### Adding a New Dataset Loader

1. Create loader class in `dataset_handlers/loaders.py`:
```python
class NewLoader(DatasetLoader):
    def load(self) -> Dataset:
        # Load from your source
        return dataset

    def get_source_info(self) -> dict:
        return {"source_type": "new_source", ...}
```

2. Add handling in `run_training()` and preview endpoints in `merlina.py`
3. Update Pydantic models if needed
4. Add UI controls in frontend

### Modifying Training Parameters

ORPO-specific parameters are in the `ORPOConfig` class:
- `beta` - Controls preference optimization strength (higher = stronger preference)
- `max_length` - Total sequence length (prompt + completion)
- `max_prompt_length` - Maximum prompt length
- `max_completion_length` - Calculated automatically

LoRA parameters are in `LoraConfig`:
- `r` - Rank (controls adapter size)
- `lora_alpha` - Scaling factor (typically 2x rank)
- `target_modules` - Which layers to apply LoRA (q_proj, v_proj, etc.)

## New Features (v1.1)

### Persistent Job Storage (job_manager.py)

Jobs are now stored in SQLite database (`./data/jobs.db`) and persist across server restarts.

**Key classes:**
- `JobManager` - Main interface for job CRUD operations
- `JobRecord` - Dataclass representing a job with all fields

**Important methods:**
- `create_job(job_id, config)` - Create new job
- `update_job(job_id, **kwargs)` - Update job fields
- `get_job(job_id)` - Retrieve job
- `list_jobs(status, limit, offset)` - Query jobs with filtering
- `add_metric(job_id, step, loss, ...)` - Record training metrics
- `get_metrics(job_id)` - Retrieve time-series metrics

**Database schema:**

**WebSocket endpoint:**
- `GET /ws/{job_id}` - Connect to receive real-time updates

### Pre-flight Validation (preflight_checks.py)

Validates configuration before training to prevent wasted GPU time.

**Key class:**
- `PreflightValidator` - Runs all validation checks

**Checks performed:**
1. GPU availability and compute capability
2. VRAM estimation vs available memory
3. Disk space for checkpoints
4. Model access and gating (HF token check)
5. Dataset configuration validity
6. Training hyperparameter sanity checks
7. API token validation (W&B, HF)
8. Optional dependency checks (Flash Attention, xformers)

**Returns:**
- List of errors (blocking issues)
- List of warnings (recommendations)
- Detailed check results per category

### Enhanced Training Runner (training_runner.py)

New modular training function with WebSocket integration.

**Key features:**
- `WebSocketCallback` - Custom TRL callback that broadcasts metrics
- Async WebSocket updates during training
- Better error handling and logging
- GPU memory tracking
- Metric persistence to database

**Functions:**
- `run_training_sync(job_id, config, job_manager, uploaded_datasets)` - Main training function
- Called by FastAPI background tasks

## File Locations

- **Source code:** `src/` directory
- **Models:** `./models/{output_name}/`
- **Training artifacts:** `./results/{job_id}/`
- **Job database:** `./data/jobs.db` (SQLite)
- **Frontend:** `./frontend/`
- **Test fixtures:** `./tests/fixtures/`

## Configuration System

Merlina uses a centralized configuration system (`config.py`) with support for environment variables and `.env` files.

### Configuration Files

**`.env` file** (create from `.env.example`):
```bash
# Copy the example file to get started
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env with your settings
nano .env
```

**Key Settings:**
- **Server:** `HOST`, `PORT`, `DOMAIN` - Server binding and public URL
- **Paths:** `DATA_DIR`, `MODELS_DIR`, `DATABASE_PATH` - Storage locations
- **External Services:** `WANDB_API_KEY`, `HF_TOKEN` - API keys for W&B and HuggingFace
- **System:** `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`, `LOG_LEVEL` - GPU selection and logging
- **Security:** `CORS_ORIGINS`, `MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE_MB` - Access control and limits

### Frontend URL Detection

The frontend automatically detects the API URL from the browser's current location using `window.location`. This means:
- Works on `localhost` during development
- Works on any production domain (e.g., `https://merlina.example.com`)
- Works behind reverse proxies
- Automatically handles HTTP/HTTPS and WebSocket protocols

No frontend configuration needed!

## New API Endpoints

**Validation:**
- `POST /validate` - Validate configuration before training

**Job Management:**
- `GET /jobs/history?status=&limit=&offset=` - Get paginated job history
- `GET /jobs/{job_id}/metrics` - Get detailed training metrics
- `GET /stats` - Database and system statistics

**WebSocket:**
- `WebSocket /ws/{job_id}` - Real-time training updates

## Testing New Features

```bash
# Test validation
python examples/validate_and_train.py

# Monitor training via WebSocket
python examples/websocket_monitor.py <job_id>

# View job history and metrics
python examples/job_history.py
python examples/job_history.py <job_id>
```
