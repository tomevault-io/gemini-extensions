# AGENTS.md — canonical agent context for PurrCode

This is the single source of truth for AI coding agents (Claude Code, Cursor, OpenCode, Codex, and similar) working in this repository. `CLAUDE.md` points here; do not duplicate hard constraints into per-tool files. Human contributors: also see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## What this project is

PurrCode is an open-source Claude Code addon that plays a continuous cat-purring sound while Claude is processing a turn. Full spec: [docs/PurrCode-PRD-v0.4.md](docs/PurrCode-PRD-v0.4.md) — the PRD is the roadmap; amendments to it are PRs.

## Architecture map

```text
Claude Code (plugin hooks, async exec form)
        │  stdin JSON → argv start|stop|failure|session-end
        ▼
  hook adapter (`packages/cli` → dist/hook.js)
        │  control pipe (UDS / named pipe)
        ▼
  per-user player daemon (session registry, watchdog, fades)
        │
        ▼
  audio backend tiers: sidecar (1) → mpv (2) → native (3) → fake (CI)
```

Plugin package lives under `packages/plugin/marketplace/` (assembled via `pnpm plugin:build`). Persistent config / WAV cache: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}` when running as a plugin.

## Current state & how to pick work

The project is being built sprint-by-sprint from a written backlog. **Before doing anything, read [docs/planning/START-HERE.md](docs/planning/START-HERE.md)** — it has the progress board, dependency order, and the per-story workflow. Never start a story whose dependencies aren't done, and never cross a 🚧 human gate.

- Sprint plan and working agreements: `docs/planning/00-sprint-plan.md`
- Story details: `docs/planning/sprint-N-*.md` (acceptance checkboxes are the definition of done)
- Spike/architecture decisions: `docs/decisions/` (use `TEMPLATE.md`)

## Invoking the PurrCode agent

The callable project agent is **`purrcode`**. Canonical prompt: [docs/agents/purrcode.md](docs/agents/purrcode.md). Tool wrappers (frontmatter only) live at:

| Tool | Invoke | Wrapper |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Cursor** | `/purrcode` or Task → purrcode | [`.cursor/agents/purrcode.md`](.cursor/agents/purrcode.md) |
| **Claude Code** | `@purrcode` or ask to use the purrcode agent | [`.claude/agents/purrcode.md`](.claude/agents/purrcode.md) |
| **OpenCode** | Tab to `purrcode`, or `@purrcode` | [`.opencode/agents/purrcode.md`](.opencode/agents/purrcode.md) |

Workflow skills (implement story / spike / sprint review) live under [`.cursor/skills/`](.cursor/skills/); Claude mirrors under [`.claude/skills/`](.claude/skills/) point at those files. OpenCode loads `AGENTS.md` plus [opencode.json](opencode.json) instructions.

## Commands

```bash
pnpm install                 # setup (Node 20+, pnpm workspace)
pnpm lint                    # ESLint + Prettier check
pnpm typecheck               # tsc --noEmit, strict
pnpm test                    # Vitest unit tests
PURRCODE_FAKE_AUDIO=1 pnpm e2e:fake-audio   # integration suite (fake backend)
pnpm sidecar:fetch-vendor    # pin miniaudio + stb_vorbis into packages/sidecar/vendor/
pnpm sidecar:build           # build host-platform purr-sidecar into packages/sidecar-<os>-<cpu>/
pnpm e2e:sidecar             # real sidecar lifecycle (needs a built binary; skipped if absent)
pnpm plugin:build            # assemble + validate Claude Code plugin (packages/plugin/)
pnpm --filter purr-code build  # compile CLI / hook / daemon → packages/cli/dist
```

MVP CLI (after build): `purrcode install|uninstall`, `on|off`, `status`, `volume`, `preview`, `doctor`. Ops notes: [docs/troubleshooting.md](docs/troubleshooting.md).

## Verifying changes headlessly

Set `PURRCODE_FAKE_AUDIO=1` (as in the Commands block above) to use the fake audio backend (story PC-101): it implements the `AudioBackend` interface by writing timestamped playback events (start/volume/fade/stop) to a JSONL log instead of a sound card. Vitest runs TypeScript tests directly — you do **not** need `pnpm --filter purr-code build` before `pnpm test` / `pnpm e2e:fake-audio`. Build is required for the real CLI binary, plugin assemble, and Claude Code install smokes. Perceptual audio QA (seams, pops, fatigue) is human-only; never claim to have verified it.

## Hard constraints (violations are P0)

1. **Fail silent, fail open.** Hook-path code must always exit 0 and never write a byte to stdout/stderr — a single transcript error notice in Claude Code is a critical bug. Errors go to the opt-in debug log only.
2. **No network code anywhere.** Runtime makes zero network requests. No telemetry, no analytics, no update checks.
3. **No new runtime dependencies** without a linked issue approving them. Dev dependencies need a reason in the PR.
4. **All child processes in exec form** (argument arrays). Never shell-interpolated strings, never `eval`, never `npx` in anything a hook executes.
5. **Treat hook stdin as untrusted:** schema-validate, size-cap, never interpolate its fields into shell commands or paths.
6. **Never modify** release workflows (`.github/workflows/` publish/release files), `sounds/` audio assets, or licensing files (`ASSETS.md`, `LICENSE`) — human-gated per CODEOWNERS. Audio provenance/credits live in [`ASSETS.md`](ASSETS.md).
7. **No prompt/transcript access.** Never read, store, or log prompt text, responses, tool inputs, or repository contents in runtime code or logs.
8. Agents may not contribute audio assets and may not sign the DCO on a human's behalf. (Humans may instruct an agent to *place* an already-sourced, license-verified file the human provides — still update `ASSETS.md` in the same commit.)

## Conventions

- **One branch per sprint.** Each sprint gets a single branch off `main`, named `sprint-N-<short-slug>` (e.g. `sprint-1-walking-skeleton`, `sprint-2-reliability`). All stories in that sprint land on that branch; merge via one PR when the sprint is ready. Never commit sprint work directly to `main`. Commits still reference the story ID (e.g. `feat(daemon): session registry state machine (PC-105)`).
- TypeScript strict, Node 20+, pnpm. Conventional-commit style messages referencing the story ID.
- When a story is complete: tick its checkboxes in the sprint file and update the board in `docs/planning/START-HERE.md` in the same commit.
- Scope discipline: PRD §5 non-goals are enforced. If a change drifts toward them, stop and say so instead of building it.
