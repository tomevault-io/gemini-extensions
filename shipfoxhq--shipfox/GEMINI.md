# Agent guidelines

Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) before working on this project.

## Running tasks locally

This project uses [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) to manage tool versions. `node`, `pnpm`, and `turbo` are all available in the shell: no `npx` needed.

```sh
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Build all packages
turbo build

# Check (lint + format + import sorting) / type-check / test
turbo check
turbo type
turbo type:emit
turbo test

# Scope to a specific package
turbo build --filter=@shipfox/api...

# Start local services (Docker required)
docker compose up -d

# Dev mode with hot-reload (apps only)
pnpm --filter=@shipfox/api dev
```

## Module exports and imports

Avoid broad barrel files inside modules. Prefer importing from the file that owns the
symbol, such as `#core/auth.js` or `#presentation/dto/user.js`, rather than
`#core/index.js` or another catch-all index.

Package root exports should stay intentionally small: export only shared entities and
functions that are part of the package's public API. Do not export internal DB helpers,
routes, auth wiring, or test-only utilities from a package root unless another package
is meant to depend on them directly.

## Codebase conventions

### Backend modules

Backend feature packages are composed as declarative modules. A feature package
typically exports a `ShipfoxModule` that declares its `database`, `routes`,
`auth`, `e2eRoutes`, `publishers`, `subscribers`, and/or `workers`; apps should
compose those module declarations rather than wiring feature internals directly.
Module initialization runs in array order, so list modules with shared database
dependencies before dependents.

API feature packages usually follow a layered shape:

```text
src/
  core/          Domain behavior, entities, providers, and typed errors
  db/            Drizzle schema, migrations, persistence functions, row mappers
  presentation/  Fastify routes, auth adapters, and DTO conversion
```

### HTTP routes

Define HTTP endpoints with `defineRoute`, Zod schemas, and named auth methods
from `@shipfox/node-fastify` / `@shipfox/api-auth-context`. Prefer route groups
for shared prefixes, plugins, and inherited auth instead of repeating those
concerns in each route.

### DTOs and API contracts

Public HTTP contracts live in sibling `*-dto` packages. Put Zod request/response
schemas, inferred DTO types, and public event names/payload types there so the
backend, client, and E2E helpers all share the same contract.

Use camelCase for internal domain objects and snake_case for external HTTP DTOs.
Keep the conversion centralized in `presentation/dto/*` files; route handlers
should call a mapper like `toProjectDto()` rather than manually shaping response
objects inline.

### Persistence and events

Drizzle schema files own row-to-domain mapping. A table file should define the
table, infer DB types, and export `toX()` mappers; higher layers should work with
domain objects rather than raw Drizzle rows where possible.

Outbox events are part of a module's public contract. Define event names and
payload maps in the module's `*-dto` package, write outbox events in the same
transaction as the state change, and register publisher tables on the module
declaration.

### Client packages

Client feature packages should expose both transport functions and React Query
hooks. Use `@shipfox/client-api` for JSON requests, auth refresh, and `ApiError`
handling; colocate query keys, raw request functions, and hooks in the feature's
`hooks/api/*` module.

### Form management

Client forms use `@tanstack/react-form` driven by the `*BodySchema` Zod schemas
from the matching `*-dto` package. Zod 3.24+ implements Standard Schema, so
schemas pass directly to TanStack Form's `validators`:

```ts
const form = useForm({
  defaultValues,
  onSubmit: async ({value}) => { /* mutation */ },
});

<form.Field
  name="email"
  validators={{onBlur: bodySchema.shape.email, onSubmit: bodySchema.shape.email}}
>
```

Do not add `@tanstack/zod-form-adapter` or write custom Zod adapters: the
adapter package is legacy (pinned to form-core v0.x) and unnecessary on v1+.

Render every labeled input through `FormField` from `@shipfox/react-ui`, using
`FormFieldInput` to inherit the field's id, `aria-invalid`, and
`aria-describedby` automatically:

```tsx
<FormField label="Email" id="email" error={fieldError(field)}>
  <FormFieldInput
    type="email"
    value={field.state.value}
    onChange={(event) => field.handleChange(event.target.value)}
    onBlur={field.handleBlur}
  />
</FormField>
```

Validation runs `onBlur` per field and `onSubmit` for the form. Show field
errors only after the field has been blurred or after a submit attempt. See
the `fieldError(field)` helper at the bottom of each page form for the
boilerplate.

Server errors are classified by a per-feature `errorToFormError(error)` pure
function in `form-errors.ts`. It returns either
`{kind: 'field', field, message}` (routed to
`form.setFieldMeta(field, prev => ({...prev, errorMap: {...prev.errorMap, onServer: message}}))`)
or `{kind: 'form', message}` (rendered in an `<Alert>` above the form).
Use the `onServer` slot in `errorMap` (not `errors` directly) because
TanStack Form v1 derives `field.state.meta.errors` from `errorMap`, so a
direct write to `errors` gets overwritten on the next derived read.
TanStack Form auto-clears `errorMap.onServer` on the next field validation
(blur/change), which is the correct UX. Add a Vitest node test enumerating
every `ApiError` code the feature handles, plus the unknown-error fallback.

For draft persistence across navigation (auth flows), sync TanStack Form values
into a Jotai atom on field blur and on form unmount only (never on every
keystroke) and filter the atom shape explicitly so unrelated fields (e.g.
signup's `name`) don't leak into a `{email, password}` draft.

### E2E testing

Read [e2e/README.md](e2e/README.md) before adding or reshaping E2E tests. It is
the source of truth for suite levels, setup rules, screens, granularity,
dependency boundaries, and debugging.

Load-bearing rules:

- E2E setup must stay HTTP-first. Add module-owned setup routes under
  `/__e2e/<module>` and wrap them in `@shipfox/e2e-setup-*` helpers; do not
  create E2E data through direct database access.
- Put browser locators, navigation, waits, and visual normalization behind
  `@shipfox/e2e-screens-*` or `@shipfox/e2e-kit/ui` methods, not inline in
  specs.
- Granularity is review-enforced: one test proves one behavior, and one file
  covers one surface or one journey.

Each E2E package must also declare an explicit workspace dependency on the package
it verifies, such as `@shipfox/client-auth` for `@shipfox/e2e-client-auth`, so
Turbo includes the referenced package in the task DAG.

### Running the flow workflow E2E suite

`@shipfox/e2e-flow-workflows` (`e2e/suites/flow/workflows`) is the full-loop
suite. Each scenario pushes a real `workflow.yml` to Gitea and asserts on public
run and log APIs after webhook delivery, definition sync, trigger dispatch,
Temporal orchestration, a local source runner, and step execution. See
`e2e/suites/flow/workflows/README.md` for the scenario format and deep runbook.

The pure `expect.yaml` evaluator has Vitest node tests that need no infrastructure:

```sh
turbo test --filter=@shipfox/e2e-flow-workflows
```

The full loop needs the Docker services, then the repo E2E harness:

```sh
# 1. Local services (postgres, temporal, garage, gitea).
docker compose up -d            # Conductor worktrees: node dev/worktree-services.mjs up

# 2. Start the API/client dev servers and run the suite.
mise run e2e -- --filter=@shipfox/e2e-flow-workflows
```

The `e2e` mise task reads Conductor worktree ports from `.context/local-services/env`,
starts the API with E2E routes enabled, starts the client with the test VCS provider
enabled, waits for both to become ready, then runs `turbo test:e2e`. Diagnostics
land in `.context/shipfox-e2e-logs/`; flow runner logs are attached to failed
scenario results.

### Configuration

Each app and each package that reads the environment owns a `src/config.ts`. It
calls `createConfig` from `@shipfox/config` (a thin wrapper over envalid) with one
validator per variable: `str`, `num`, `bool`, `host`, `port`, `url`, or `email`. A
validator with a `default` is optional; one without a default is required, so a
missing value fails startup. Keep the file flat: declare the schema, then derive
any helpers (such as a mailer) below it.

Document every variable with the validator's `desc` property, never a `//` comment
beside it. `desc` stays attached to the schema: envalid's default reporter prints it
when a required variable is missing at startup, and any config tooling can read it.
A `//` comment never leaves the source file. When you find an existing `//` note on
a config param, move it into `desc`.

Write the descriptions for self-hosters, not for maintainers:

- Plain language, one idea per sentence, present tense.
- Say what the variable does and how to set it.
- List the accepted values when the variable is constrained: enums like
  `LOG_LEVEL` or `MAILER_TRANSPORT`, a URL, a comma-separated list.
- Note when a variable is required, or when it depends on another (for example,
  `SMTP_HOST` is required when `MAILER_TRANSPORT` is `smtp`).
- No marketing words.

```ts
export const config = createConfig({
  AUTH_JWT_SECRET: str({
    desc: 'Secret used to sign and verify user access tokens (JWTs). Required, with no default, so startup fails when it is missing.',
  }),
  MAILER_TRANSPORT: str({
    desc: 'How emails are delivered. Use console to print them to the log, or smtp to send them through an SMTP server.',
    default: 'console',
  }),
});
```

## Code comments

Default to fewer comments. Well-named functions, types, and variables carry the
intent; the reader knows the language and the codebase, so a comment that
restates the code is pure overhead: it adds nothing to read and silently rots
when the code changes. The bar for a comment is: **would a competent reader be
surprised or stuck without it?** If not, delete it.

### Explain *why*, never *what*

A comment earns its place by capturing intent the code cannot express: a
non-obvious constraint, a workaround, a deliberate trade-off, or a subtlety that
would otherwise read as a mistake. The good comments already in this codebase all
answer "why":

```ts
// Algorithm-confusion guard: nothing outside the HS256 allowlist may verify.

// Drizzle creates its migrations schema/table outside its own migration transaction.
// Serialize migrators so parallel package tests do not race on that shared setup.

// `request.routeOptions.url` is the route template (e.g. /public/cache/:id/chunk)
// but can leak a query string in some Fastify edge cases. Strip it.
```

Delete comments that narrate the next line. These say nothing the code doesn't:

```ts
// bad: restates the code
// Set test environment variable
process.env.FOO = "bar";

// bad: restates the function name
// Helper function to create properly typed configs
export function createConfig(...) {}
```

### Prefer self-documenting code over a comment

When you feel the urge to explain a block, first try to make the explanation
unnecessary: extract a named function, rename a variable, or reach for an
idiomatic construct (`value ?? fallback`, early return, a typed enum). A good
name beats a comment because it travels with every call site and can't drift out
of sync. Only when the *why* genuinely can't live in the code does it become a
comment, and if that why needs a paragraph, the awkwardness is usually the code;
refactor first.

### Keep control flow readable

When a conditional expression is doing real work, name the decision before the
branch. Prefer a small, intention-revealing variable such as `hasPendingStep`,
`usesAuthoredMode`, or `shouldRetry` over repeating a compound expression inside
`if`, ternary, or object-spread conditionals. Inline checks are fine for obvious
single comparisons, but once a condition combines multiple concepts, give it a
name so the branch reads like a sentence.

Split long functions into focused units when they mix distinct responsibilities,
such as loading state, validating preconditions, building a payload, handling an
error branch, and applying the state change. Keep the top-level function as the
orchestration path and move self-contained branches into helpers with names that
describe the decision or action. Do not extract tiny helpers for their own sake;
extract when it removes nesting, clarifies a branch, or gives a meaningful name
to a reusable piece of logic.

### Use JSDoc for documentation, not narration

Reserve `/** ... */` for the public API of shared packages (exported functions,
types, and config that other packages consume), where editor hover-docs add real
value. JSDoc is also appropriate for usage documentation when a function is
intended to be called outside its immediate module or local context and the
caller needs to know constraints, ordering, side effects, or examples that are
not obvious from the signature. Document parameters and behaviour that the
signature can't convey; do not restate the type or the name:

```ts
/**
 * Verifies an HS256-signed token and validates its payload against `schema`.
 * Rejects any token whose `alg` header is outside the HS256 allowlist.
 *
 * @param audience - When set, jose rejects an `aud` mismatch before the schema runs.
 */
```

Self-evident functions need no docstring at all; one that echoes
`getRunner(id): Runner` is noise. But when an internal function does earn a
comment, prefer `/** ... */` over a loose `//`: it attaches to the symbol and
surfaces on hover at every call site.

### Keep planning and process out of the source

No `// TODO`, `// v1 only`, `// added in follow-up PR`, or references to
planning-doc decisions (`/plan-eng-review A1`) in module or function headers.
Speculation about future work ("today X, tomorrow Y") and tracked tasks belong in
`TODOS.md`, the issue tracker, or the design doc, not in code that outlives them.

## Auth & token security

The auth module issues two stateless bearer tokens, a **user session token** and
a **job lease token**, each signed with its own dedicated secret. The full
security model (trust boundaries, scope, threat model, and rotation) lives in
`libs/api/auth/README.md#security-model`; read it before touching anything that
mints, verifies, or carries either token.

The job lease token is a single-job **capability**, not an identity. When working
near it, keep its authority narrow:

- **Keep the scope to one job.** Do not add claims that grant access beyond the
  single job the lease names. It is not a runner identity, not workspace-wide, and
  not a replacement for the long-lived runner credential.
- **Keep a single issuer; everyone else verifies only.** Scheduling mints leases;
  every other side does an in-process signature check with no callback. Treat the
  runner and the agent workload it hosts as untrusted; they only present a token.
- **Keep the lifetime bounded** and never trade the short TTL for convenience.
- **Server state is the final gate.** A valid token must never be sufficient to
  advance work on its own; on the lease path, terminal step/progression state
  always wins (job finalization is enforced outside it), and cancellation rides on
  the heartbeat response.
- **Never log a raw token.** There is no automatic redaction; tokens must not reach
  logs, traces, or error payloads. Secrets come from configuration, never code.

If the no-revocation window proves too wide, bind the lease to live runner or job
state; do not broaden what the token itself authorizes.

## Error handling

Error handling is a cross-layer concern, not an HTTP detail. The guiding
principle is **let errors bubble up and translate them only when crossing a
boundary**. Each layer owns one job, and the error changes shape only at the
edges:

```
external system  →  api/core: typed error  →  presentation: ClientError  →  global handler  →  HTTP response
```

Never swallow or wrap an error unless you add meaning. If you can re-throw
as-is, do. Do not catch errors just to log them; let unknowns reach the global
handler.

### Domain errors (`core` / `db`)

Throw typed domain errors from domain and persistence code. Define them in
`core/errors.ts` as plain `Error` subclasses with a human-readable message, a
`name`, and any context as public readonly fields. They carry **no HTTP
concerns** (no status, no client-facing code), which keeps them reusable by
workers, subscribers, and jobs, not just routes:

```ts
export class WorkspaceNotFoundError extends Error {
  constructor(workspaceId: string) {
    super(`Workspace not found: ${workspaceId}`);
    this.name = 'WorkspaceNotFoundError';
  }
}
```

### External and infrastructure errors (`api` / `core`)

Catch errors from external systems (GitHub, GCP, etc.) at the layer that talks
to them and re-throw them as a typed error carrying a `reason` enum (e.g.
`IntegrationProviderError`) rather than letting raw SDK errors leak upward.
Callers then branch on `reason` without depending on the SDK's error shapes.
Pass `retryAfterSeconds` for backpressure reasons like `rate-limited`:

```ts
throw new IntegrationProviderError('rate-limited', message, retryAfterSeconds);
```

### Translating to HTTP responses (`presentation`)

The presentation/request boundary is the only place that turns errors into
client responses. Route `errorHandler`s are the default place to translate
known domain errors to `ClientError`; re-throw anything you don't recognize so
it reaches the global handler:

```ts
errorHandler: (error) => {
  if (error instanceof WorkspaceNotFoundError)
    throw new ClientError('Workspace not found', 'not-found', {status: 404});
  if (error instanceof LastMemberError)
    throw new ClientError(error.message, 'last-member', {status: 409});
  throw error; // unrecognized → global handler
},
```

`ClientError(message, code, params)` is the only error that produces a
structured client response. `code` is a stable kebab-case string (`not-found`,
`last-member`, `project-already-exists`). `params`:

- `status`: HTTP status, **defaults to 400**; set it for any other 4xx.
- `details`: structured data **returned to the client** (snake_case keys).
- `data`: context **logged only**, never sent to the client.
- `cause`: pass the original error when wrapping, so it stays in the chain for
  logs and diagnostics. Sentry sees unknown errors that reach the global handler;
  handled cases must capture explicitly if they need Sentry reporting.

For external errors, map the `reason` enum to a status and client code here
(e.g. `rate-limited` → 429).

### The global handler

The shared handler in `@shipfox/node-fastify` is the last resort. It sends
`ClientError` as `{code, details?}` with its status, maps Fastify
validation/known errors to 4xx codes, and logs + reports unknown errors to
Sentry as a 500 `server-error`. Anything that reaches it untyped becomes an
opaque 500, so translate errors you can describe before they get here.

## Metrics & observability

Metrics are emitted through OpenTelemetry and scraped by Prometheus. All the
plumbing (the SDK, the Prometheus exporters, the meter providers) lives in
`@shipfox/node-opentelemetry`; an app turns it on once at startup (the API does
this in `apps/api/src/core/run.ts`) and feature packages only define and record
instruments. Never add a metrics SDK or exporter to a feature package.

The worked example is `libs/api/runners/src/metrics`. Copy its shape.

### Two planes: instance vs service

There are two separate meter providers on two ports, and the choice between
them is about *what the number means*, not convenience.

- **Instance metrics** (`instanceMetrics.getMeter(name)`, port 9464) are
  counters and histograms recorded inline as an event happens: a job claimed,
  a request served, a duration observed. Each pod exposes its own values and
  Prometheus sums across pods. This is the default; reach for it first.
- **Service metrics** (`getServiceMetricsProvider().getMeter(name)`, port 9474)
  are observable gauges that read shared state (a queue depth, a backlog size,
  a current count) through a callback that runs on each scrape. They live on a
  separate provider because every pod reading the same database row would report
  the same value, and Prometheus must not sum those copies. Use a service gauge
  only for point-in-time state derived from shared storage.

If you are counting things that happen, you want an instance counter. If you are
reporting how many things currently exist, you want a service gauge.

### Package layout

Each feature package that emits metrics owns a `src/metrics/` folder:

```text
src/metrics/
  instance.ts   Counters and histograms, created at module load, recorded inline.
  service.ts    register<Module>ServiceMetrics(): observable gauges (omit if none).
  index.ts      Re-exports the above.
```

Instance instruments are created at the top of `instance.ts` and exported, then
imported and recorded where the event occurs. Creating them at import time is
safe for tests: `instanceMetrics.getMeter` returns a no-op meter until an app
starts instrumentation, so a test that merely imports the module records nothing
and binds nothing.

That same lazy resolution is a production trap. The metrics API has no proxy
meter (unlike traces, which back-fill), so an instrument created before the app
registers the global meter provider stays a no-op forever and never exports. The
app must therefore start instance instrumentation **before** the module graph
loads: preload it via `--import`, not from inside `run()`. See
`apps/api/src/instrumentation.ts` (wired into the Dockerfile CMD and the dev
script). A new app that calls `startInstanceInstrumentation` in-process after
importing its feature modules will silently emit nothing.

Service gauges are different. Reaching `getServiceMetricsProvider()` binds the
metrics port, so it must never run at import time; it would break any unit test
that imports the module. Fetch the meter, create the gauges, and attach their
callbacks **inside** an exported `register<Module>ServiceMetrics()` function.
Wire that function to the module via the `metrics` hook:

```ts
export const runnersModule: ShipfoxModule = {
  name: 'runners',
  // ...
  metrics: registerRunnersServiceMetrics,
};
```

`registerModuleMetrics` (called once from the app bootstrap, after
`startServiceMetrics` and `initializeModules`) invokes every module's hook. A
package with no shared-state gauge omits `metrics` entirely.

### Naming

Snake_case, prefixed with the module name: `runners_job_claimed`,
`runners_pending_jobs`, `runners_claim_duration`. The prefix is the namespace;
it keeps `workflows_*` and `runners_*` from colliding in one Prometheus tenant.

Do not hand-append `_total` to counters or unit suffixes to histograms: the
Prometheus exporter derives `_total`, `_milliseconds`, and friends from the
instrument kind and its `unit`. Set `unit: 'ms'` and `advice.explicitBucketBoundaries`
on histograms; the name stays unit-free.

### Cardinality is the one rule that matters

A metric label multiplies into one time series per distinct value. Labels must
be **bounded and low-cardinality**: an outcome, a reason, a type, a conclusion,
a provider, an OS: values you could list on one hand or one page.

Never label a metric with an unbounded identifier: no `jobId`, `runId`,
`workspaceId`, `organizationId`, `userId`, raw URL, or error message. One job ID
in a label is one new time series per job forever; it melts Prometheus and the
bill. When you need per-entity detail, that is what logs and traces are for;
put the ID in a `logger()` field, not a metric label.

Type the label set so the shape is enforced at every call site:

```ts
const jobClaimedCount = meter.createCounter<{outcome: 'claimed' | 'empty'}>(
  'runners_job_claimed',
  {description: 'Job-claim attempts by outcome'},
);
```

### Where recording lives

Metrics are observability, like logging, so they are allowed in `core` and `db`;
record where the event is known most precisely, not only at the HTTP edge.
Keep recording out of pure row-to-domain mappers and DTO converters. A service
gauge's callback queries through the same `db/` functions the rest of the
package uses; it does not reach for raw Drizzle.

## Unit Testing Strategy (Client Apps)

The detailed client testing strategy lives in
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#unit-testing-strategy-client-apps). In short:
keep pure behavior in Vitest `node` tests, reserve React Testing Library for
rendered React behavior, and move full user journeys to Playwright E2E.

## Unit Testing Strategy (Node Apps)

Tests use **Vitest** and run against a real PostgreSQL database, not mocks. The philosophy is to test against real infrastructure where possible and only mock external dependencies (feature flags, cloud provider APIs, etc.).

Each app has two databases: one for the app itself (named after the app, e.g. `api`) and a dedicated test database (named `<app>_test`, e.g. `api_test`). The test database is selected via `process.env` overrides in `test/env.ts`.

### Test infrastructure per package

```
test/
  globalSetup.ts   # Truncates all DB tables once before the suite runs
  setup.ts         # Opens/closes the PG connection per file; calls vi.restoreAllMocks() in afterEach
  env.ts           # Overrides process.env with test values (fake credentials, TZ=UTC, etc.)
  index.ts         # Re-exports all factories
  factories/       # One file per entity, using Fishery
```

`vitest.config.ts` points `globalSetup` at `test/globalSetup.ts` and `setupFiles` at `test/setup.ts`.

### Factories (Fishery)

Factories live in `test/factories/` and use **Fishery**. They provide sensible faker-based defaults and persist to the DB via their `onCreate` handler:

```typescript
// build in memory only
const runner = runnerFactory.build({ organizationId: "org-123" });

// persist to DB
const runner = await runnerFactory.create({ organizationId: "org-123" });

// build a list
const jobs = jobFactory.buildList(3);
```

Use `build()` for pure unit tests on `core/` logic; use `create()` when the code under test queries the DB.

### Test structure: Arrange / Act / Assert

Each test is written in three clearly separated phases, in order:

1. **Arrange**: declare all data and preconditions needed for the test.
2. **Act**: call the function or trigger the behaviour under test.
3. **Assert**: verify the outcome.

Keep a blank line between each phase so the boundary is immediately visible:

```typescript
it("marks the runner as terminated", async () => {
  const runner = await runnerFactory.create({ organizationId });

  await terminateRunner(runner.id);

  const updated = await getRunner(runner.id);
  expect(updated.latestEvent?.type).toBe("terminated");
});
```

Never interleave assertions with setup, fold the act into the arrange line, or inline the act inside an assertion. The act must always be assigned to a variable first:

```typescript
// bad: act collapsed into assert (AAA violation)
expect(await terminateRunner(runner.id)).toBeDefined();

// good
const result = await terminateRunner(runner.id);
expect(result).toBeDefined();
```

If a test needs assertions in multiple places it is likely testing more than one thing; split it.

### Test isolation

- Each `describe` block generates a fresh `organizationId` (or other scope key) via `faker` in `beforeEach` so tests don't share data.
- `vi.restoreAllMocks()` is called automatically in `afterEach`; no need to do it manually.
- DB state is cleaned by truncating tables in `globalSetup`, not between individual tests. A module's `globalSetup` may only truncate tables owned by that module, so avoid relying on an empty DB mid-suite.
- Do not truncate from individual test files. Scope test data with fresh identifiers such as `projectId`, `workspaceId`, `organizationId`, or another module-owned key per test, and filter reads/assertions to that scope.

### Mocking

Keep mocking minimal. Only mock what cannot run in the test environment (external HTTP APIs, GCP clients, feature flag SDKs):

```typescript
vi.mock("@shipfox/node-feature-flag", () => ({
  getStringFeatureFlag: vi.fn().mockResolvedValue("gcp"),
}));
```

### Testing Fastify routes

Create a fresh `fastify()` instance per `describe` block, register only the route under test, and use `.inject()`:

```typescript
describe("listRunners", () => {
  const app = fastify();
  beforeAll(() => {
    app.register(listRunnersRoute);
  });

  it("returns runners for an organization", async () => {
    const runner = await runnerFactory.create({ organizationId });

    const res = await app.inject({
      method: "GET",
      path: "/",
      query: { organizationId },
    });

    expect(res.statusCode).toBe(200);
    expect(res.json().runners).toHaveLength(1);
  });
});
```

### Parameterised tests

Use `describe.each` / `it.each` for exhaustive coverage over enum values or similar sets:

```typescript
describe.each(runnerEventTypeEnum.enumValues)('createRunnerEvent "%s"', (eventType) => {
  it('persists the event', async () => { ... });
});
```

## Storybook story structure

Story files should be ordered for exploration first, broad visual coverage
second, composition coverage third, and interaction tests last.

Start every component story file with `Playground` when the component can be
rendered as a single basic example. `Playground` shows the neutral/default
component and exposes Storybook controls for meaningful visual and content props.
Rename old `Default` stories to `Playground` unless the story is not an
interactive playground.

After `Playground`, group variant axes into as few stories as practical. Prefer
matrix stories such as `Variants`, `Sizes`, `States`, `Content`, `Errors`, or
`DataStates` that render rows/columns of related states in one canvas. Do not add
one screenshot-producing story per enum value when a grouped matrix can show the
same coverage.

Put composition stories after variant matrices. Name them `Compositions` or with
a specific scenario name, and group related complex scenarios in one canvas when
that keeps Argos coverage clear and cheaper.

Put pure test stories last. Use `play` for assertions or interactions that prove
behavior, not for visual states that can be rendered directly with args or
fixtures. Prefix test-only exports with `Test` or give them a `Tests / ...`
display name so they are easy to distinguish from visual coverage.

## Visual Regression Testing

Argos catches UI drift on every PR via one named build per source package. The
`buildName` is the package name without the `@shipfox/` scope:

- `react-ui`: `@shipfox/react-ui` stories captured in **light + dark** by `@storybook/addon-vitest` + `@argos-ci/storybook/vitest-plugin`. Capture is part of `turbo test` for `@shipfox/react-ui`. It is the theming source of truth, so it is the only build that snapshots every story in both themes.
- `client-workflows`: `@shipfox/client-workflows` stories, captured the same way under `turbo test` for that package. Story-based capture isn't limited to `react-ui`: any client package with stories can register its own `argosVitestPlugin` build named after the package. Feature (`client-*`) builds capture the primary **dark** theme only; keep their `parameters.argos.modes` to `dark` since `react-ui` already proves theme correctness.
- `client-auth`: `@shipfox/client-auth` Storybook stories, captured the same way under `turbo test` for that package. Today this covers workspace switcher states in dark without full workspace E2E setup.
- `e2e-client-<module>` (today: `e2e-client-auth`): explicit `argosScreenshot(page, '<surface>/<state>')` calls in the matching `e2e/suites/client/<module>/*` Playwright specs. Each E2E package sets its own `buildName` matching the package name without the `@shipfox/` scope so PR checks stay scoped per surface. Place the call **after** the assertions that prove the page reached the expected state; the helper waits for fonts and layout, not for content you have not asserted on.

A surface with both Storybook and E2E visual coverage gets two standalone builds
in the same Argos project, one for the client package and one for the E2E
package. Do not merge them with Argos parallel or sharded builds. Visual capture
stays under the cached `test` task; do not split it into `test:visual`.

To cover a component state a single render cannot reach (error states, populated lists, etc.), add it as a new story rather than driving interactions in `play`. To cover a new page state, add an `argosScreenshot` call in the existing test that already drives there; do not write a screenshot-only spec.

`ARGOS_TOKEN` and `CI` are passed through Turbo via `globalPassThroughEnv` in `turbo.jsonc`. If you add another env var the visual flow needs, allowlist it there or Turbo will silently strip it. See `CONTRIBUTING.md#visual-regression-testing` for the longer walkthrough.

## Design System

Always read [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) before making any visual or UI decisions. Token
families, font choices, color usage, spacing conventions, and surface-level guidance
(DAG view, log tails, status pills, runner tables, etc.) are all defined there.

Two conventions trip up newcomers and must be enforced in review:

1. **Spacing base is 1px.** `p-4` is 4px, not 16px. The Tailwind class names map
   directly to pixels because `index.css` sets `--spacing: 1px`.
2. **Brand orange is the focus ring and interactive highlight, not the primary
   CTA fill.** The default primary button is inverted neutral. Reach for orange
   for focus states, links, and "this is where you are" affordances only.

Do not deviate without explicit user approval and a corresponding entry in the
DESIGN.md decisions log.
