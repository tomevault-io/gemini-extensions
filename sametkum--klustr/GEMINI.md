```

The `internal/` ↔ `app/` split is intentional:
- `internal/kube` is Wails-agnostic and stays testable with plain `go test`.
- `app/` is the thin Wails binding adapter — if we ever ship a CLI or web mode, only `app/` is rewritten.

## Architecture Patterns

### Live data flow — Informer pattern

We never poll the Kubernetes API. Resource lists are kept live by `client-go` Informers running in the Go backend:

```
K8s API ──watch──> Informer ──cache+events──> Wails event ──> Zustand store ──> React UI
```

- **Per-kind factory routing.** On `Watch()` the manager probes `SelfSubjectAccessReview` for every built-in kind (`internal/kube/permissions.go`). Each kind ends up in one of three buckets — cluster-wide, scoped to the kubeconfig context's `namespace:` field, or denied — and that decision drives which factory owns its informer:
  - **`factory`** is the all-namespaces `SharedInformerFactory`, created when the user has cluster-wide list/watch for at least one kind. Admin users land here for every kind.
  - **`scoped`** is a namespaced factory built with `informers.WithNamespace(ns)`, created when at least one kind only resolves through the kubeconfig namespace.
  - Denied kinds get no informer at all; lister methods return the empty result and `Get` paths return `errKindNoAccess`. The UI shows an empty list rather than 403-looping in the background.
- The handler-registration block in `(*contextWatcher).registerHandlers` (`internal/kube/informers.go`) enumerates every covered kind in one table so the routing decisions stay auditable. Covered kinds: workloads (`Pod`, `Deployment`, `ReplicaSet`, `ReplicationController`, `StatefulSet`, `DaemonSet`, `Job`, `CronJob`), networking (`Service`, `Endpoints`, `EndpointSlice`, `Ingress`, `NetworkPolicy`), config (`ConfigMap`, `Secret`), storage (`PersistentVolumeClaim`, `PersistentVolume`, `StorageClass`), cluster (`Namespace`, `Node`, `Lease`, `ResourceQuota`, `LimitRange`, `IngressClass`, `PriorityClass`, `RuntimeClass`), autoscaling (`HorizontalPodAutoscaler`, `PodDisruptionBudget`), admission (`MutatingWebhookConfiguration`, `ValidatingWebhookConfiguration`) and the full RBAC set (`ServiceAccount`, `Role`, `RoleBinding`, `ClusterRole`, `ClusterRoleBinding`).
- Per-kind listers (`Pods`, `Services`, `Secrets`, …) call `(*contextWatcher).factoryFor(kind)` instead of touching `w.factory` directly. That helper consults the access map and returns the routed factory or nil — every lister/Get site is identical in shape (`f := w.factoryFor("X"); if f == nil { return EMPTY }`).
- Namespace selection in the UI is applied at lister-query time. Switching namespaces does **not** tear down or restart informers.
- Informer lifecycle is owned by `ClientManager`; cancellation propagates via `context.Context`.
- The backend debounces event bursts (~100 ms window) before emitting to the frontend to avoid flooding React.
- Pod metrics are not informers — `metrics.k8s.io` only supports List. The frontend polls every 15 s and hides usage columns if the API is unavailable.

### Custom Resources — auto-discovery via crdWatcher

`internal/kube/crd.go` owns a `crdWatcher` that runs alongside the typed informer factory:

1. On context attach, it lists `apiextensions.k8s.io/v1 CustomResourceDefinition` and emits a `_crds` change so the frontend (`useCRDStore`) can render the sidebar.
2. When the user navigates into a CR list view, `EnsureCRWatch(group, version, resource)` lazily starts a **dynamic** informer for that GVR. Subsequent list/get calls hit the local cache — no on-demand list calls to the apiserver.
3. CR list/detail go through the dynamic client only — there is no typed clientset for CRs. The detail dialog shows YAML by default.

Two CRDs upgrade the sidebar from "browse" to "first-class integration":
- `gateway.networking.k8s.io` (any kind) → adds the **Gateway** group (see Gateway API section below).
- `applications.argoproj.io` → adds the **Argo CD** group (see Argo CD section).

Both detections live in `App.tsx` (`hasGatewayAPI`, `hasArgoApplications`) by group/resource so reacting to a brand-new CRD install requires no rebuild.

### Helm — release Secrets via the informer cache

`internal/kube/helm.go` implements Helm v3 read+mutation against the cluster directly using the upstream `helm.sh/helm/v3` library — **no `helm` binary on PATH, no embedded chart packaging**.

- **List path is informer-backed**: helm releases are stored as `Secret`s with a `helm.sh/release.v1` type. The contextWatcher's Secret event handler calls `maybeTouchHelm()` so a release change re-triggers Helm UI updates without an extra list. See `helm_cache.go` for the per-(context, namespace, name) cache.
- **Mutations** (Install / Upgrade / Rollback / Uninstall) call helm v3 actions directly with a `kubeClient` constructed from our existing `restConfig`. Every Install/Upgrade returns a **dry-run** diff first; the UI shows it before the second call applies for real.
- **Repos** are a JSON file under `~/Library/Application Support/klustr/helm-repos.json` (or platform equivalent). `SearchCharts` and `ChartVersions` use the existing repo index files Helm wrote.

### Argo CD — auto-detected, K8s-API-driven

`internal/kube/argocd.go` lists `argoproj.io/v1alpha1 Application` via the dynamic client and runs a CR informer for them.

- **Sync** and **Refresh** are implemented as direct annotations on the Application:
  - Sync: PATCH `operation.initiatedBy` + `operation.sync` block (the same payload `argocd app sync` PUTs).
  - Refresh: PATCH the `argocd.argoproj.io/refresh` annotation.
- This means Klustr works against any Argo CD install **without** an `argocd-server` ingress, an Argo CD login, or the `argocd` CLI on the user's PATH. The only requirement is that the kubeconfig user has permission to update Applications.
- The Application detail dialog reads `.status.resources` to render a **Resources** tab listing every managed object. Each row deep-links into the regular Klustr detail panel for that object — so you can drill `App → Deployment → Pod → Logs` without leaving the dialog.

### Gateway API — typed informers

`internal/kube/gateway.go` uses `sigs.k8s.io/gateway-api/pkg/client/informers/externalversions` (a typed factory) rather than the dynamic client, so list updates are live without polling and `.status.conditions` arrive with strong types.

- Sidebar group shown only when the `gateway.networking.k8s.io` CRDs are present.
- Detail dialogs render the listener table, per-rule `match → backend → weight` matrix and `RouteParentStatus` block by reading the typed status — a `ResolvedRefs=False` / `RefNotPermitted` backend is one click away.
- Vendor-neutral: works with Envoy Gateway, Cilium, Istio, Contour, NGINX Gateway Fabric or any conformant implementation.

### Multi-context aggregated mode

Klustr can drive 2+ contexts at once as a single virtual cluster:

- `useActiveContexts()` returns `aggregatedContexts` when length ≥ 2, else `[selectedContext]`. Every list/detail call fans out per context client-side and tags rows with a `Context` column.
- The connection picker (`ConnectionsScreen`) lets the user **save a named group** of contexts. `contextGroups` lives in the UI store; selecting a saved group is one click. The same saved groups also appear in a **Groups section at the top of the in-session `ContextSwitcher` dropdown**, so a group can be activated mid-session without dropping back to the Welcome screen.
- The status bar pings every active context every ~25 s (`/version` against a copy of the rest.Config with a 5 s timeout — see `manager.go` `Ping`). The dot turns amber on slow pings, red on failure with the real error in the tooltip.
- Switching contexts (or the namespace selection across them) does not restart informers for already-attached contexts — `Watch` is idempotent per context and `StopWatch` is what tears one down.

### Context tags & groups

`ui.persistence.ts` persists three related concepts:

- **Tags** (`contextTags`): up to `MAX_TAGS_PER_CONTEXT` (3) string ids per context. Colored, picked from a fixed palette. Custom tag definitions live in `customTags`.
- **Groups** (`contextGroups`): named multi-context selections with their own color. Activating a group sets `aggregatedContexts` and `activeGroupId` in one transaction.
- **Namespace selection** (`selectedNamespaces`): multi-namespace filter that **survives context switches and reloads**. `normalizeContexts` deliberately does NOT clear it — namespaces that don't exist in the newly active context(s) are silently ignored at lister-query time, so the filter keeps applying cleanly across single-context, aggregated and group-active modes.

The top bar paints a thin colored stripe matching the primary tag (or active group) so the user has a constant visual reminder which environment they're touching. This is the only "guardrail" today against running a destructive action on the wrong cluster — a richer destructive-context guard is on the roadmap.

### Frontend state — three layers, never mixed

| Layer | Tool | Use |
|---|---|---|
| Real-time resource state | Zustand (`resources`, `metrics`, `portForwards`, `crds`, `helm`) | Live caches fed by Wails events |
| Server actions | TanStack Query (mutations only) | Delete, apply, scale, restart, start/stop port-forward, helm install/upgrade |
| UI state | Zustand (`ui` + `ui.types` + `ui.persistence`, plus `tablePrefs` and `namespaceFavorites`) | Selected context(s)/namespace(s), theme, detail navigation stack, table column prefs, namespace stars |

Do not put Informer data into TanStack Query's cache, and do not put mutation state into Zustand. Crossing these layers causes subtle bugs around invalidation and re-renders.

### UI layout

Four-region layout:

- **Top color stripe** (optional): reflects active context tag / group color.
- **Header**: app name, context switcher, namespace selector, context-tag picker, port-forward indicator, disconnect button, theme picker.
- **Sidebar**: collapsible resource-type navigation. Static groups in order: **Cluster** (Overview, Nodes, Namespaces, API Services, Flow Schemas, Priority Levels, Events) / **Workloads** (Overview, Pods, Deployments, StatefulSets, DaemonSets, ReplicaSets, ReplicationControllers, Jobs, CronJobs) / **Config** (ConfigMaps, Secrets, ResourceQuotas, LimitRanges, PriorityClasses, RuntimeClasses, Leases) / **Autoscaling** (HorizontalPodAutoscalers, PodDisruptionBudgets) / **Admission** (MutatingWebhooks, ValidatingWebhooks) / **Network** (Services, Ingresses, NetworkPolicies, EndpointSlices, Endpoints, IngressClasses) / **Storage** (PVCs, PVs, StorageClasses, CSI Drivers, CSI Nodes, Volume Attachments) / **Access Control** (Access Review, Service Accounts, Cluster Roles, Roles, Cluster Role Bindings, Role Bindings, CSRs) / **Helm** (always shown). Conditional groups: **Gateway API** (when the `gateway.networking.k8s.io` CRDs are present) and **Argo CD** (when the `applications.argoproj.io` CRD is present). Discovered CRDs (anything outside the above) are listed by API group below the static groups.
- **Main**: resource list (`ResourceTable` generic over `<T>`) → detail Dialog with `Overview / Logs / Exec / Events / History / YAML` tabs as relevant.
- **Status bar** (bottom): per-active-context ping dots, port-forward count, GitHub repo link, version label.

The detail panel keeps a small navigation stack (`resourceNavStack` in `ui.ts`): drilling from a workload into a related pod, or from a pod into its owner/node, pushes the previous resource so the back arrow in the header can pop back to it.

## Adding a new built-in resource

Each kind is a thin, repeatable slice. Pick the `<group>` your kind belongs to from the sidebar (`workloads` / `networking` / `config` / `storage` / `cluster` / `autoscaling` / `admission` / `rbac`) and add to the matching per-group files. To add one:

1. **Backend types**: `XxxInfo` (list shape) in `internal/kube/informers_<group>.go`, `XxxDetail` (detail shape) in `internal/kube/details_<group>.go`.
2. **Informer registration**: append an event-handler block in `(*contextWatcher).start` (still in `informers.go`) that calls `w.touch("Xxx")`, then add `"Xxx"` to the initial-touch kind list at the end of `start()`.
3. **Listers**: `(*contextWatcher).Xxxs(namespace)` and `(*contextWatcher).Xxx(namespace, name)` in `informers_<group>.go`. Detail builder is in `details_<group>.go`.
4. **Manager**: list and detail forwarder methods on `*ClientManager` in `manager_<group>.go`. Bodies are 5 lines; mirror neighbors.
5. **App bindings**: `ListXxxs` and `GetXxx` on `*App` (in `app/`). Wails autogenerates the TS binding on the next `wails dev`.
6. **GVR**: entry in `kindToGVR` (`internal/kube/mutate.go`) so YAML edit / delete / scale work via the dynamic client.
7. **Frontend**: types in `frontend/src/lib/api.ts`, slot in `frontend/src/store/resources.ts`, add the kind/view to the `ResourceKind` / `ResourceView` unions in `frontend/src/store/ui.types.ts`, create `XxxView.tsx` + `XxxDetailBody.tsx` under `frontend/src/features/<plural>/`, dispatch case in `ResourceDetailPanel.tsx`, sidebar entry in `_shared/resourceGroups.ts` (`RESOURCE_GROUPS`) + `MainView` case in `App.tsx`.

Always init Go slices through `append([]string{}, src...)` so nil never serializes as JSON `null` — the React detail bodies treat these as arrays unconditionally.

## Adding a Custom Resource (CRD) view

For CRs Klustr **already lists generically** via the CRD watcher with a YAML-only detail. Only carve a dedicated typed view if the CR has meaningful status / spec UI beyond `kubectl edit` — see how `argocd.go` and `gateway.go` are done:

- Either reuse a typed client (Gateway API has one) or unmarshal `*unstructured.Unstructured` into a typed Go struct before populating the Detail.
- Hide the CR behind the generic CRD sidebar entry by default; promote it to its own sidebar group only when a CRD detection in `App.tsx` confirms the API is present.
- Mutations should go through the K8s API (PATCH / annotation flip), not by shelling out to a vendor CLI.

## Coding Conventions

### Comments

- Default to **no comments**. Well-named identifiers are the documentation.
- Add a comment only when the **why** is non-obvious: a hidden constraint, a workaround for a specific bug, a non-trivial invariant, a deliberate deviation from convention.
- Never write "WHAT" comments — the code already says what it does.
- Never reference issues, PRs, callers, or "added for feature X" — that belongs in the commit message and rots in the code.

### General code style

- Don't add error handling for impossible cases. Validate at system boundaries (user input, Kubernetes API responses, file I/O); trust internal callers and framework guarantees.
- Don't introduce abstractions for hypothetical future needs. Three similar lines is better than a premature helper.
- Don't add backwards-compatibility shims, feature flags, or `_unused` placeholder renames unless the project actually needs them.
- Delete dead code immediately. Don't leave `// removed` comments.

### Go

- Idiomatic Go: small interfaces, value semantics where appropriate, errors as values.
- `context.Context` is the first parameter for any function that may block, spawn goroutines, or talk to the network.
- Return errors; don't panic in library code.
- Long-running goroutines (informers, log streams, exec sessions, port-forwards) **must** accept a `context.Context` and stop cleanly on cancel.
- Never log or expose user credentials, tokens, or kubeconfig contents, even at debug level.

### TypeScript / React

- `strict: true`. No `any` unless at a true boundary, and only with a comment explaining why.
- Prefer narrow types over broad ones. Discriminated unions over optional flags.
- Wails bindings under `frontend/src/lib/wails/` are auto-generated. Never edit by hand. Wrap them in `frontend/src/lib/api.ts` for ergonomic helpers.
- Real-time data is read from Zustand selectors only — never call Go directly in a render path.
- Wrap heavy components (Monaco, xterm.js) in Suspense so they don't block initial render.
- Use shadcn/ui primitives as the base; do not pull in a second component library.

### Kubernetes interactions

- Use the typed `client-go` clientset for built-in resources.
- Use the typed `sigs.k8s.io/gateway-api` clientset for Gateway API kinds.
- Use the dynamic client + discovery client for unknown CRDs.
- Never use `kubectl`, `helm` or `argocd` as a subprocess from inside the app. Talk to the API directly.

### Conventional Commits

- Use Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `chore:`, `test:`, `docs:`).
- Prefer many small, logically scoped commits over a single monolithic one — target ~10–20 small commits per feature batch when work splits cleanly.
- Append **`[skip ci]`** to docs-only / asset-only commits (`docs:`, `chore(docs):`, README-only `chore:`, screenshot or video updates) so the release workflow doesn't run on content-only changes. Never use it on `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `perf:`, `test:`, or anything that changes runnable code — those should keep running CI.

## Testing

The test surface is **headless unit tests only** — Vitest+jsdom for frontend, `go test` for backend. No Playwright, no in-app integration tests.

- **What to test**: store reducers and selectors (`store/*.test.ts`), pure helpers (`internal/kube/*_test.go`), parsers (`releaseInfoFromRelease`, `crdInfoFromUnstructured`), and decision logic that does not require a running Kubernetes API.
- **What to skip**: anything that needs the Wails runtime, a real kubeconfig, or a real cluster. Tests in `internal/kube` that need a client construct a fake clientset directly — they never call `manager.Watch`.
- Tests live next to the code (`foo.go` ↔ `foo_test.go`, `foo.ts` ↔ `foo.test.ts`).
- Manual verification is `wails dev` and a real kubeconfig — see **Verification Before Reporting Done** below.

## Things to Avoid

- Polling the Kubernetes API instead of using Informers (metrics.k8s.io is the only exception — it has no watch).
- Installing anything inside the cluster — Klustr is a pure client. The only exception is the explicit "install metrics-server" action, which the user opts into and which Klustr can later uninstall by the label it stamps.
- Importing Wails-specific packages into `internal/kube/...`.
- Returning nil slices from Go: the JSON encoder emits `null` and React `.length` access blows up. Use `append([]string{}, src...)`.
- Passing a fresh object literal into TanStack `state.columnSizing` (or similar controlled props) every render — TanStack fires the change handler and the controlled store ping-pongs into an infinite loop.
- Adding global stores beyond the documented layers — current legal set is `resources`, `metrics`, `portForwards`, `crds`, `helm`, `namespaceFavorites`, `ui`, `tablePrefs`. Anything new needs a reason in the PR.
- Generating boilerplate docs (CHANGELOG, CODE_OF_CONDUCT, SECURITY, PR templates) before they're needed. The contributor-facing surface today is `CONTRIBUTING.md` and a single `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.yml`.
- Marketing-style copy or emoji in UI strings unless explicitly requested.
- Editing auto-generated Wails bindings.
- Staging anything under `hack/`. That directory is the user's local fixtures and is curated by hand.
- Triggering the release workflow on docs-only / asset-only changes. Append **`[skip ci]`** to those commit subjects so the build doesn't run for a README tweak.

## Development Workflow

```bash
mise install                  # one-time: installs Go, Node, Wails CLI per .mise.toml
wails dev                     # hot-reload dev session; opens native window

# Backend
go test klustr/internal/...   # unit tests
go vet ./...                  # vet
golangci-lint run             # full lint (optional, slower)

# Frontend (inside frontend/)
npm test                      # Vitest
npm run lint                  # ESLint
npm run typecheck             # tsc --noEmit
npm run build                 # production bundle
```

Docker is **not** required — local dev uses native toolchains; CI builds use GitHub-hosted runners directly.

## Release Process

Klustr is pre-1.0 and ships from `main`. The flow per release:

1. **Land all changes on `main`** via small Conventional Commits.
2. **Decide the bump**:
   - `feat:` commits in the range → minor bump (`v0.X.0`).
   - Only `fix:` / `refactor:` / `test:` / `docs:` / `chore:` → patch bump (`v0.X.Y`).
3. **Smoke-test in `wails dev`**: run it, exercise the changed feature, wait for explicit OK before pushing.
4. **Tag and push**: `git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "vX.Y.Z" && git push origin vX.Y.Z`. This triggers `.github/workflows/release.yml`.
5. **Wait for the workflow** (~7 min). It builds darwin-arm64 + linux-amd64 (.tar.gz + .deb), attaches all three as assets, and creates a **draft** GitHub release with auto-generated notes appended to the install block.
6. **Rewrite the draft notes**: write the notes to a `.md` file and pass `--notes-file`:
   ```bash
   gh release edit vX.Y.Z --notes-file release-notes.md
   ```
   `--notes-file` is required — inline heredocs (`--notes "$(cat <<EOF…EOF)"`) silently break triple-backtick code fences inside the body. Keep the **Install** block at the bottom of the file verbatim (Homebrew + Manual `curl` snippet, with the tag pinned in the URL).
7. **Publish**: `gh release edit vX.Y.Z --draft=false`. The same workflow run automatically bumps the Homebrew cask in the tap repo (`HOMEBREW_TAP_TOKEN`) and the AUR `klustr-bin` package (`AUR_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`). Both bumps are skipped for prerelease tags (those containing a `-`).

Notes on the workflow:
- `prerelease: true` is set automatically when the tag contains a `-` (e.g. `v0.15.0-rc1`).
- Linux (amd64) is published as a release asset. Windows is still built-but-unpublished — that ships as part of the v1 path.
- Auto-update is **not** wired in — also a v1 prerequisite.

## Verification Before Reporting Done

- Go: `go test klustr/internal/...` and `go vet ./...` pass.
- Frontend (inside `frontend/`): `npm test`, `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck` pass.
- Manual: `wails dev` runs and the changed feature actually works in the native window. Type checks alone are not sufficient for UI work.
