# Shipwright SDLC Framework

## WHAT
- **Purpose**: AI-powered SDLC pipeline built on Claude Code — from user description to deployed, tested, secured application
- **Architecture**: Monorepo of Claude Code plugins (skills + hooks + scripts)
- **Stack**: Python 3.11+ scripts, Claude Code plugin system, uv package manager

## HOW

### Development
```bash
uv sync                              # Install dependencies
uv run pytest tests/ -v               # Run tests for a plugin (from plugin dir)
uv run pytest integration-tests/ -v   # Run integration tests (from root)
uvx ruff@0.15.15 check .              # Bug-focused lint — GATING in CI (ci.yml)
```

**Lint is a hard CI gate.** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs `uvx ruff@0.15.15
check .` with no `|| true` / `continue-on-error`, so a lint failure blocks merge.
The ruleset is deliberately curated (Pyflakes + a few bug-class pycodestyle
rules, cosmetic rules omitted) and lives in the root `pyproject.toml`
`[tool.ruff.lint]` — run it locally before pushing. ruff is pinned (not a project
dependency) so a new release can't silently change the gate.

### Plugin Structure (each plugin follows this pattern)
```
plugins/shipwright-{name}/
  .claude-plugin/plugin.json          # Plugin metadata
  hooks/hooks.json                    # Claude Code hooks
  agents/                             # Subagent definitions (markdown)
  skills/{name}/SKILL.md              # Main skill definition (folder = slash command suffix)
  scripts/                            # Python scripts (checks, hooks, lib, tools)
  tests/                              # Plugin-specific tests
  pyproject.toml                      # Plugin dependencies
```

### Key Environment Variables
```
SHIPWRIGHT_SESSION_ID        # Unified session ID across all plugins
SHIPWRIGHT_PLUGIN_ROOT       # Absolute path to active plugin directory
```

### Conventions
- All scripts invoked via `uv run`
- Hooks use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` for path resolution
- Config files: `shipwright_*_config.json` (written to target project)
- Env var prefix: `SHIPWRIGHT_`
- Config file prefix: `shipwright_`

### Hooks & Pipeline Reference
- **Reference doc:** `docs/hooks-and-pipeline.md`
- **ALWAYS read this file first** when working on any plugin. It contains the
  complete context loading matrix (who reads what), artifact write matrix (who
  writes what), hooks registry, config data flow, and between-phase actions.
- **Rule:** When modifying any hook (hooks.json), adding/removing a pipeline phase,
  changing phase validators, altering between-phase actions, or changing what a
  plugin reads at startup (context loading), you MUST update
  `docs/hooks-and-pipeline.md` to reflect the change.
- This document is the single source of truth for understanding what fires when,
  who reads/writes which artifacts, and the impact of pipeline changes.

### When editing plugin-side files

Changes under `plugins/*`, `shared/scripts/`, or any `SKILL.md` file do
NOT auto-sync to the plugin cache at `~/.claude/plugins/cache/shipwright/`
that Claude Code uses at runtime. After `git push`, run:

```bash
bash scripts/update-marketplace.sh
```

**Scope:** This is shipwright-monorepo-specific and only applies when
developing the plugins themselves. End-users who consume the plugins via
`/shipwright-iterate`, `/shipwright-build`, etc. on their own projects do
NOT need this step — they run the installed/cached plugin versions.

**Why it matters:** Without the sync, plugin-side fixes land in the dev
repo but never reach runtime. Iterates 7-11 all had plugin-side fixes
(SKILL.md F11 updates, shared script improvements) that silently never
took effect because this step was skipped.

**Enforcement (Iterate C.3, 2026-05-21):** the script
`scripts/check_plugin_cache_sync.py` detects drift between the local
plugin-cache and repo HEAD via per-file SHA-256 comparison. Run it
manually (fail-soft WARN by default; `--strict` for CI use) — a
future iterate will wire it into a SessionStart hook so every iterate
starts with a sync check.

### Documentation Guide
- **Reference doc:** `docs/guide.md`
- **Rule:** When adding a new skill, changing a skill's command/arguments/flags,
  modifying the pipeline flow, or changing the constitution, check whether
  `docs/guide.md` needs an update. Key sections to check:
  - Chapter 4 (phase descriptions) — if skill behavior changed
  - Chapter 7.5 (constitution) — if constitution rules changed
  - Chapter 8 (quality gates) — if hooks changed
  - Appendix B (command reference) — if commands/flags changed
- The guide is the primary user-facing documentation. README.md is a summary
  that links to the guide.

### Testing
```bash
# Single plugin
cd plugins/shipwright-build && uv run pytest tests/ -v

# All integration tests
uv run pytest integration-tests/ -v
```

## Context
- **Guide**: docs/guide.md (primary user-facing documentation)
- **Hooks & Pipeline**: docs/hooks-and-pipeline.md (context loading, hooks registry, between-phase actions)
- **Glossary**: shared/glossary.md (mandatory-read — shared vocabulary
  used by hooks, agents, subagents, and compliance audits — Allowlist,
  Ratchet, Anti-Ratchet, Producer, Action-Unit, Canon-Gate, …)

## Pre-commit hooks

Contributors must install the bloat anti-ratchet pre-commit hook
**once per clone**:

```bash
bash scripts/install-hooks.sh       # POSIX / Git-Bash on Windows
.\scripts\install-hooks.ps1         # PowerShell on Windows
```

This sets `git config core.hooksPath scripts/hooks` (idempotent;
refuses to overwrite an existing different value without `--force`).
The hook only blocks commits that ratchet an existing entry in
`shipwright_bloat_baseline.json` — new crossings are surfaced by the
Group H detective audit post-merge. See `shared/glossary.md` for the
terminology and `shared/scripts/lib/anti_ratchet.py` for the rule.

## Asking the user questions (plain language)

When you ask the user a question — a clarification, a choice between options,
or a confirmation — phrase it so a **non-senior developer or a normal user**
can understand, from a functional standpoint, what is actually being decided.
The person answering may not know the internals; do not make them decode
jargon to reply.

- **Lead with the functional meaning:** say what the choice changes about how
  the app behaves or what the user gets — not the implementation detail. Ask
  "Should a deleted item be recoverable, or gone for good?" rather than "Soft
  delete with a tombstone flag or hard delete?".
- **Avoid unexplained jargon.** If a technical term is genuinely unavoidable,
  add a short plain-language gloss in parentheses (e.g. "idempotent — safe to
  run twice without doubling the effect").
- **Make options concrete and comparable.** Give each option in plain words
  with its real-world trade-off ("Option A is simpler but slower to load;
  Option B is faster but adds a setup step"), not a raw technical menu.
- **Rule of thumb:** a product owner reading the question should be able to
  answer it without asking "what does that mean?". If they couldn't, rewrite it.

This applies to every interactive question — clarifications, plan approvals,
design feedback, and remediation choices alike. It governs *phrasing only*;
the underlying rigor of the work is unchanged.
