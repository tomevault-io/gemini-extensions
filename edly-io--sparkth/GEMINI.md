## Essential Commands

```bash
# Docker (recommended for full stack)
make up              # Build + start (PostgreSQL + Redis + API + frontend)
make dev.up          # Dev mode with hot reload
make down            # Stop containers
make clean           # Stop + wipe database volume

# Local backend (requires uv)
make dev             # Install dev dependencies
make api             # FastAPI on http://0.0.0.0:7727
make mcp             # MCP server (HTTP mode)
make test            # Run pytest
make cov             # Tests with coverage
make lint            # Ruff lint
make fix             # Ruff autofix + format
make mypy            # mypy --strict

# Local frontend
make frontend        # Next.js dev server on :3000
make frontend.build  # Static export → frontend/out/
make frontend.lint   # ESLint

# Database
make migrations      # Run pending Alembic migrations
make shell           # Shell inside API container
make db-shell        # PostgreSQL shell
make create-user     # Create user (pass args after --)
```

## Environment Setup

Copy `.env.example` → `.env`. Required variables:

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL connection string |
| `SECRET_KEY` | JWT signing key |
| `LLM_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | Fernet key for encrypting stored LLM API keys |
| `REDIS_URL` | Redis for session caching, used in chat plugin |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID/SECRET` | Google OAuth |

CI uses `DATABASE_URL=sqlite+aiosqlite:///./test.db`. Tests always run against SQLite.

## Development Workflow: Test-Driven Development (TDD)

**Always follow TDD. Write tests before implementation — no exceptions.**

### The Mandatory TDD Cycle

For every new feature, endpoint, service method, utility, or plugin tool:

1. **Write the test first** — create or update the relevant file under `tests/` mirroring the module path (e.g. `app/services/foo.py` → `tests/services/test_foo.py`)
2. **Confirm the test fails** — the test must fail before any implementation exists (red phase)
3. **Write the minimum implementation** to make the test pass (green phase)
4. **Refactor** while keeping all tests green

> Never write implementation code before a corresponding failing test exists.

For bug fixes: write a test that reproduces the bug first, verify it fails, then fix.

## Database Migrations

**Never edit an existing migration file. No exceptions.**

Any schema change — add column, drop column, rename, alter type, add index — requires a new Alembic migration file.

Editing an existing migration breaks environments that have already applied it, causing irreproducible state across dev, staging, and production.

To create a new migration, use:
```bash
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "describe your change"
```

**Never hand-craft migration filenames or revision IDs.** Always use `alembic revision --autogenerate` — it generates a valid random hex revision ID. Hand-crafted IDs risk tooling confusion and non-hex characters that break Alembic expectations.

To apply all pending migrations:
```bash
make migrations
```

### Preventing Split Heads

Multiple Alembic heads occur when two branches each generate a migration from the same parent revision and merge independently. Before creating a new migration, always check for existing heads:

```bash
alembic heads
```

If there are already multiple heads, merge them first:
```bash
alembic merge heads -m "merge migration heads"
```

After merging a PR that adds a migration, any other in-flight branch that also adds a migration must rebase so its `down_revision` points to the new tip — otherwise merging it will create another split head.

## Exception Handling

**Never use bare `except Exception` blocks. Always catch specific exception types.**

This rule applies to all layers: API endpoints, services, plugins, MCP tools, and utilities.

### Rules

1. **Catch only what you expect.** Name the exact exception(s) a call can raise.
2. **Always log the exception** with enough context to diagnose the failure (module, operation, relevant IDs).
3. **Re-raise or not — developer's call.** If the caller can recover or needs to know, re-raise (the original or a domain-specific exception). If the error is fully handled at this level, swallowing is acceptable — but the log entry is still mandatory.
4. **Never silence exceptions silently.** A bare `except` or `except Exception` with no log is always wrong.

### Examples

```python
# ✅ Good — specific exception, logged, re-raise is a conscious choice
from app.core.logger import get_logger

logger = get_logger(__name__)

# Re-raising (caller needs to know)
try:
    result = await canvas_client.get_course(course_id)
except HTTPStatusError as exc:
    # When you need the full traceback (not just the message):
    logger.exception("Canvas API error fetching course %s", course_id)
    # or equivalently:
    logger.error("Canvas API error fetching course %s: %s", course_id, exc, exc_info=True)
    raise

# Not re-raising (fully handled here)
try:
    await cache.set(key, value)
except RedisError as exc:
    logger.warning("Cache write failed for key %s: %s", key, exc)
    # continue without cache — non-fatal

# ✅ Good — multiple specific exceptions
try:
    data = json.loads(raw)
except (json.JSONDecodeError, UnicodeDecodeError) as exc:
    logger.error("Failed to parse response payload: %s", exc)
    raise ValueError("Invalid response format") from exc

# ❌ Bad — bare except, no log
try:
    result = await some_service.call()
except Exception:
    pass

# ❌ Bad — catches too broadly, replaces with a vague error
try:
    result = await some_service.call()
except Exception as exc:
    raise RuntimeError("something went wrong") from exc
```

### Choosing whether to re-raise

| Situation | Recommendation |
|---|---|
| Error is fatal to the current request/operation | Re-raise (original or domain exception) |
| Error is non-fatal and a fallback exists | Swallow — but log at `warning` or `error` level |
| Unsure | Re-raise — it's always safer to surface than to hide |

### Finding the right exceptions to catch

- Check the library's documentation or source for declared exceptions.
- For `httpx` use `httpx.HTTPStatusError`, `httpx.RequestError`.
- For SQLAlchemy/SQLModel use `sqlalchemy.exc.SQLAlchemyError` and its subclasses.
- For Redis use `redis.exceptions.RedisError` and its subclasses.
- For FastAPI/Starlette use `fastapi.HTTPException`, `starlette.exceptions.HTTPException`.
- For LangChain use `langchain_core.exceptions.LangChainException`, `OutputParserException`, and provider-specific errors.
- For standard I/O use `OSError`, `FileNotFoundError`, `PermissionError`, etc.
- For Pydantic use `pydantic.ValidationError`.

## Commit Messages

Every commit must follow Conventional Commits. No exceptions.

```
<type>(<scope>): <short description>

[optional body — explain WHY, not what]
```

**Types:** `feat` | `fix` | `refactor` | `test` | `docs` | `chore`

**Scopes:** `api` | `frontend` | `plugins` | `rag` | `mcp` | `migrations` | `ci` | `core` — custom scopes are acceptable when none of these fit (e.g. `auth`, `docker`, `deps`)

**Rules:**
- Subject line: max 72 chars, lowercase, no trailing period
- Use imperative mood — "add auth" not "added auth"
- Body required when change needs context — why was this needed?
- One logical change per commit — do not bundle unrelated changes
- Never commit directly to `main`

**Examples:**
```
feat(api): add JWT refresh token endpoint

fix(migrations): handle missing plugins table on startup

refactor(rag): extract vectorstore into separate service

test(mcp): add integration tests for tool registration

chore(ci): pin uv version in GitHub Actions
```

## Pull Request Descriptions

Every PR must use the template in [`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md). It auto-populates on GitHub.

**Rules:**
- Title: `<type>(<scope>): short description` — max 70 chars, lowercase
- "What" must name the problem solved, not just the mechanism
- Every non-trivial code path needs a test step
- Flag breaking changes and migration requirements explicitly — never bury them
