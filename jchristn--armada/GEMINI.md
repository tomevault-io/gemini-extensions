> Armada is a multi-agent orchestration system that scales human developers with AI. It coordinates AI coding agents ("captains") to work on tasks ("missions") across git repositories ("vessels"). Written in C# (.NET), it exposes MCP tools for fleet, vessel, captain, mission, voyage, dock, signal, and merge queue management.

## Project Context
Armada is a multi-agent orchestration system that scales human developers with AI. It coordinates AI coding agents ("captains") to work on tasks ("missions") across git repositories ("vessels"). Written in C# (.NET), it exposes MCP tools for fleet, vessel, captain, mission, voyage, dock, signal, and merge queue management.

IMPORTANT -- Context Conservation: When using Armada MCP tools, use armada_enumerate with a small pageSize (10-25) to conserve context. Use filters (vesselId, status, date ranges) to narrow results. Only set include flags (includeDescription, includeContext, includeTestOutput, includePayload, includeMessage) to true when you specifically need that data -- by default, large fields are excluded and length hints are returned instead.

## Code Style
For C#: no var, no tuples, using statements instead of declarations, using statements inside the namespace blocks, XML documentation, public things named LikeThis, private things named _LikeThis, one entity per file, null check on set where appropriate and value-clamping to reasonable ranges where appropriate

# Mission Instructions

You are an Armada captain executing a mission. Follow these instructions carefully.

## Mission
- **Title:** Update MERGING.md, CLAUDE.md, and README.md — remove list_* references
- **ID:** msn_mms2pfqh_pt29d2cr7Eq
- **Voyage:** vyg_mms2pcu2_8pkQPfH9UGD

## Description
CONTEXT: Three additional files reference armada_list_* APIs which have been completely removed.

FILES TO MODIFY:
- docs/MERGING.md
- CLAUDE.md (project root)
- README.md (project root)

DO NOT modify any other files.

TASK 1 — docs/MERGING.md:
- Line 7: Replace `armada_list_merge_queue` in the intro paragraph with `armada_enumerate` with entityType 'merge_queue'. Example: "The merge queue is managed through MCP tools (`armada_enqueue_merge`, `armada_process_merge_queue`, `armada_enumerate` with entityType 'merge_queue', etc.)"
- Line 79: Replace the monitoring guidance. Change from mentioning both `armada_list_merge_queue` and `armada_enumerate` to just `armada_enumerate`: "Use `armada_enumerate` with entityType 'merge_queue' and status 'Failed' to check for entries that may need attention."
- Line 91: Remove `armada_list_merge_queue` from the tool reference table.
- Search the entire file for any remaining 'armada_list' references.

TASK 2 — CLAUDE.md (project root):
- Line 4: Rewrite the context conservation note. Remove all references to armada_list_*. The note currently says "prefer armada_enumerate over armada_list_* tools". Since list tools no longer exist, rewrite to simply state best practices for enumerate:
  "IMPORTANT — Context Conservation: When using Armada MCP tools, use armada_enumerate with a small pageSize (10-25) to conserve context. Use filters (vesselId, status, date ranges) to narrow results. Only set include flags (includeDescription, includeContext, includeTestOutput, includePayload, includeMessage) to true when you specifically need that data — by default, large fields are excluded and length hints are returned instead."

TASK 3 — README.md (project root):
- Line 503: Replace the tool examples. Change from mentioning `armada_list_missions` and `armada_list_events` to enumerate equivalents:
  FROM: "your MCP client can call tools like `armada_status`, `armada_dispatch`, `armada_list_missions`, `armada_cancel_voyage`, `armada_list_events`, and more."
  TO: "your MCP client can call tools like `armada_status`, `armada_dispatch`, `armada_enumerate`, `armada_voyage_status`, `armada_cancel_voyage`, and more."
- Search the entire file for any remaining 'armada_list' references.

## Repository
- **Name:** Armada
- **Branch:** armada/claude-code-1/msn_mms2pfqh_pt29d2cr7Eq
- **Default Branch:** main

## Rules
- Work only within this worktree directory
- Commit all changes to the current branch
- Commit and push your changes -- the Admiral will also push if needed
- If you encounter a blocking issue, commit what you have and exit
- Exit with code 0 on success
- Do not use extended/Unicode characters (em dashes, smart quotes, etc.) -- use only ASCII characters in all output and commit messages
- Do not use ANSI color codes or terminal formatting in output -- keep all output plain text

## Avoiding Merge Conflicts (CRITICAL)

You are one of several captains working on this repository. Other captains may be working on other missions in parallel on separate branches. To prevent merge conflicts and landing failures, you MUST follow these rules:

1. **Only modify files explicitly mentioned in your mission description.** If the description says to edit `src/routes/users.ts`, do NOT also refactor `src/routes/orders.ts` even if you notice improvements. Another captain may be working on that file.

2. **Do not make "helpful" changes outside your scope.** Do not rename shared variables, reorganize imports in files you were not asked to touch, reformat code in unrelated files, update documentation files unless instructed, or modify configuration/project files (e.g., .csproj, package.json, tsconfig.json) unless your mission specifically requires it.

3. **Do not modify barrel/index export files** (e.g., index.ts, mod.rs) unless your mission explicitly requires it. These are high-conflict files that many missions may need to touch.

4. **Keep changes minimal and focused.** The fewer files you touch, the lower the risk of conflicts. If your mission can be completed by editing 2 files, do not edit 5.

5. **If you must create new files**, prefer names that are specific to your mission's feature rather than generic names that another captain might also choose.

6. **Do not modify or delete files created by another mission's branch.** You are working in an isolated worktree -- if you see files that seem unrelated to your mission, leave them alone.

Violating these rules will cause your branch to conflict with other captains' branches during landing, resulting in a LandingFailed status and wasted work.

## Progress Signals (Optional)
You can report progress to the Admiral by printing these lines to stdout:
- `[ARMADA:PROGRESS] 50` -- report completion percentage (0-100)
- `[ARMADA:STATUS] Testing` -- transition mission to Testing status
- `[ARMADA:STATUS] Review` -- transition mission to Review status
- `[ARMADA:MESSAGE] your message here` -- send a progress message

# Mission Instructions

## Mission
- **Title:** Add missing merge queue MCP tools: delete and purge
- **ID:** msn_mmodt5yk_3G3El3YyMEK

## Description
The merge queue is missing public API/MCP tools for cleanup. Missions have `armada_purge_mission`, voyages have `armada_purge_voyage`, but there are NO equivalent tools for merge queue entries. The internal `MergeQueueService.DeleteAsync()` method exists but is not exposed.

## What to implement

### 1. `armada_delete_merge` MCP tool
- Deletes a single merge queue entry by ID
- Only allows deletion of terminal entries (Landed, Failed, Cancelled)
- Calls the existing `MergeQueueService.DeleteAsync()` method
- Parameter: `entryId` (string, required, mrg_ prefix)
- Follow the exact pattern of `armada_purge_mission` for implementation

### 2. `armada_purge_merge_queue` MCP tool  
- Bulk purge of all terminal merge queue entries (Landed, Failed, Cancelled)
- Optional `vesselId` filter to purge only entries for a specific vessel
- Optional `status` filter (e.g. only purge "Failed" entries)
- Returns count of entries deleted
- Implementation: query all terminal entries matching filters, call DeleteAsync for each

### Key files to modify

1. **`src/Armada.Server/Mcp/McpToolRegistrar.cs`** — Register the two new MCP tools following the existing pattern (look at how `armada_purge_mission` and `armada_purge_voyage` are registered)

2. **`src/Armada.Server/Mcp/McpToolHandler.cs`** (or wherever tool handlers live) — Add handler methods for the two new tools, calling into MergeQueueService

3. **`src/Armada.Core/Services/MergeQueueService.cs`** — May need a new `PurgeAllAsync()` or `DeleteAllTerminalAsync(string vesselId = null, string status = null)` method for the bulk purge. The existing `DeleteAsync` handles single entries.

4. **`src/Armada.Core/Services/Interfaces/IMergeQueueService.cs`** — Add interface method if new service method is added

5. **`MCP.md`** — Update the MCP documentation to include the two new tools with their parameters, descriptions, and examples. Follow the existing documentation format for other tools.

### Implementation guidance

- Study how `armada_purge_mission` is implemented end-to-end (registration → handler → service call) and replicate the exact same pattern
- Study how `armada_cancel_merge` is implemented since it's the closest existing merge queue MCP tool
- The `DeleteAsync` method already handles git branch cleanup (local + remote), so leverage it
- Ensure proper error handling: return clear error if entry not found or not in terminal state
- Follow the project's style guide: no var, XML docs, PascalCase public, _PascalCase private

## Existing Project Instructions

# Armada - Claude Code Instructions

## Project
Multi-agent orchestration system for scaling human developers with AI. C#/.NET.

## Build
```bash
dotnet build src/Armada.sln
```

## Test
```bash
dotnet run --project test/Armada.Test.Automated --framework net10.0
dotnet run --project test/Armada.Test.Unit --framework net10.0
dotnet run --project test/Armada.Test.Runtimes --framework net10.0
```

## Architecture
- `Armada.Core` - Domain models, database interfaces, service interfaces, settings
- `Armada.Runtimes` - Agent runtime adapters (Claude Code, Codex, extensible via IAgentRuntime)
- `Armada.Server` - Admiral process: REST API (SwiftStack), MCP server (Voltaic), WebSocket, web dashboard
- `Armada.Helm` - CLI (Spectre.Console), thin HTTP client to Admiral

## Coding Standards

### Naming
- Private fields: `_PascalCase` (e.g., `_Database`, `_Logging`)
- No `var` keyword - always use explicit types
- Async methods: suffix with `Async`, include `CancellationToken token = default`
- Use `.ConfigureAwait(false)` in library code (Core, Runtimes)
- Enums: PascalCase with `Enum` suffix, decorated with `[JsonConverter(typeof(JsonStringEnumConverter))]`
- ID prefixes: flt_, vsl_, cpt_, msn_, vyg_, dck_, sig_, art_

### Language Restrictions
- **No `var`** - always use explicit types (e.g., `List<Fleet> fleets = ...` not `var fleets = ...`)
- **No tuples** - define a class or use out parameters instead of `(string, int)` or `ValueTuple`
- **No direct `JsonElement` access** - always deserialize JSON into a strongly-typed class instance (e.g., `JsonSerializer.Deserialize<Fleet>(json)`) rather than using `GetProperty()` / `GetString()` on `JsonElement`
- **XML documentation** - all public members must have `<summary>` XML doc comments

### File Organization
- One class per file, filename matches class name
- Use `#region` blocks: Public-Members, Private-Members, Constructors-and-Factories, Public-Methods, Private-Methods
- `using` statements go **inside** the `namespace` block, not above it
- Using order: System first, then third-party, then project namespaces

### Patterns
- Constructor injection with null checks: `?? throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(x))`
- Logging: SyslogLogging with `private string _Header = "[ClassName] ";`
- Database: interface-per-entity pattern (IFleetMethods, IVesselMethods, etc.)
- Settings: nested config objects with validation in setters

### Libraries (use these, they are mine)
- SwiftStack (NuGet) - REST API framework
- Voltaic (NuGet) - MCP/JSON-RPC library
- SyslogLogging (NuGet) - Logging
- PrettyId (NuGet) - ID generation with prefixes

## Key Concepts
- Admiral = coordinator process
- Captain = worker agent (Claude Code, Codex, etc.)
- Fleet = collection of repositories
- Vessel = single git repository
- Mission = atomic work unit
- Voyage = batch of related missions
- Dock = git worktree for a captain
- Signal = message between admiral and captains
