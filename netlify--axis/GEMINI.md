## Project Overview

AXIS (Agent Experience Index Score) is a synthetic testing framework for AI agents. It runs agents against scenarios, captures transcripts, and produces graded scores across four dimensions: goal achievement, environment quality, service quality, and agent quality.

- ESM TypeScript, built with `tsc`, tested with `vitest`, CLI via `commander`
- Live terminal display uses `ink` (React for CLIs), rendered to stderr
- Runner is fully decoupled from display via a `Logger` interface

## Terminology

- **AXIS Result** (not "AXIS Score") -the composite 0–100 number. "AXIS Score" reads as "score score" since AXIS already stands for "Agent Experience Index **Score**".
- Use "AXIS Result" in all user-facing text, display output, and documentation.
- The internal property names (`axisScore`, `averageAxisScore`) are fine as code identifiers.

## Architecture

| Layer    | Key Files                                                  | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| Runner   | `src/runner/runner.ts`, `lifecycle.ts`                     | Job orchestration, concurrency, isolation; `runLifecyclePhase` captures `$AXIS_OUTPUT` markdown for `setup`/`teardown`/`beforeAll`/`afterAll` phases                                                                                                           |

### Adapter Pattern

Built-in adapters split into two factories. NDJSON-style adapters (`claude-code`, `codex`) are created via `createAgentAdapter(spec)` from `src/adapters/base/agent-adapter.ts`. ACP-based adapters (`claude-sdk`, `codex-sdk`, `gemini`, `goose`, `opencode`, `qwen-code`, `stakpak`, `blackbox`, `fast-agent`, `mistral-vibe`, `factory-droid`, `poolside`, `vtcode`, `cursor-agent`, `auggie`, `kimi`, `openhands`, `cline`, `kiro-cli`, `kilo`, `qoder`) are created via `createAcpBasedAdapter(spec)` from `src/adapters/base/acp-adapter.ts`. Each adapter is a plain factory function (e.g. `createGeminiAdapter()`) that returns an `AgentAdapter` -no classes, no inheritance. The factory owns the shared plumbing:

- Spawn + stdin.end + cleanup registration (SIGTERM on Ctrl-C)
- 10-minute timeout → SIGTERM → SIGKILL after 5s grace (timer cleared on clean exit)
- stderr capped at 100 KB
- `close` event listener registered BEFORE stdout stream to avoid missing it
- Raw output capture (NDJSON lines for `lines` mode, raw chunks for `aggregate`)
- Token estimator wiring via `StreamContext.feedAssistantText`
- CLI resolution (direct command → `npx --yes <pkg>` fallback)
- Error precedence: `extracted.metadata.error` → `stderr` → `"Agent process exited with non-zero code"`

The NDJSON-style adapters (`claude-code`, `codex`) use `lines` mode for NDJSON parsing. Custom adapters can use either `lines` or `aggregate` mode (raw stdout capture). ACP-based adapters bypass `streamConfig` entirely - the ACP SDK handles framing.

### Adding a new agent adapter

Call `createAgentAdapter(spec)` with an `AgentAdapterSpec<State>`. The spec is a single typed object -no class inheritance, no protected hooks:

| Spec field         | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`             | Adapter name (registered in `src/adapters/registry.ts`)                                                                                                                           |
| `cliCommand?`      | CLI binary for `resolveCommand`; omit if user-supplied                                                                                                                            |
| `timeoutMs?`       | Execution timeout (default 10 min)                                                                                                                                                |
| `requiredEnv?`     | Env vars validated by the runner pre-flight (e.g. `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`)                                                                                                            |
| `hasLocalSession?` | Detect a usable local CLI login (e.g. `claude login`, `codex login`). Runner calls this only when `requiredEnv` is missing — explicit API keys always win                         |
| `isolationEnv?`    | Isolation vars (e.g. `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, `CODEX_HOME`). Signature: `({ workspace, home }) => Record<string, string>`. Point `*_HOME`-style paths under `home`, never `workspace` |
| `prepare?`         | Side effects (mkdir, MCP / skills writers) before spawn                                                                                                                           |
| `resolveCommand?`  | Override how the CLI command is resolved                                                                                                                                          |
| `buildArgs`        | Build CLI arguments (prefix args from command resolution prepended automatically)                                                                                                 |
| `initialState`     | Per-run mutable state used by `streamConfig` handlers and `getResult`                                                                                                             |
| `streamConfig`     | How to process agent stdout. Discriminated union: `{ mode: "lines", onLine, onEnd? }` or `{ mode: "aggregate", onChunk, onEnd? }`                                                 |
| `getResult`        | Build final `{ result, metadata? }` from accumulated state after exit                                                                                                             |

The `streamConfig` field uses a discriminated union so the mode and its handler can never get out of sync -no runtime assertions needed. `getResult` returns `null` for "no result" (never `""`). Metadata overrides (e.g. upstream `durationMs`) are spread on top of base-computed fields.

For built-in adapters, register the factory in `src/adapters/registry.ts`. External custom adapters are loaded via the `adapters` field in `axis.config.json` -the runner dynamically imports the module and calls `registerAdapter()` before running any jobs.

#### Authentication: API key preferred, local CLI session as fallback

`claude-code` and `codex` declare `requiredEnv` (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `CODEX_API_KEY`) AND implement `hasLocalSession`. Pre-flight in `runner.ts` checks env vars first; if missing, it calls `hasLocalSession` and only throws if both signals are absent. **API keys are the preferred path** — they're explicit, work in CI, and don't bill against an individual subscription. The local-session fallback exists for laptop ergonomics: when a developer already has `claude login` / `codex login` set up, they shouldn't have to mint an API key just to try a scenario. The `prepare` hooks in those adapters materialize `~/.claude.json` / `~/.codex/auth.json` (and on macOS, the Keychain entry for Claude Code) into the isolated `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` / `CODEX_HOME` so the CLI authenticates as if it were running normally. New adapters that wrap a CLI with both API-key and login flows should follow the same pattern.

### Error Handling

- `AgentMetadata.error` is the canonical error field for failed runs
- Runner checks both `exitCode !== 0` and `metadata.error` for failure status
- Friendly error classification in `src/ui/format.ts` via `friendlyError()` -maps common patterns (quota, rate limit, auth, timeout, network) to one-line messages
- Error display: `↳ friendly message` below failed rows in tables, `Error:` line in detail views
- Scoring callbacks in `cli.ts` preserve `"failed"` status -never overwrite to `"done"`

### Debug Mode

`--debug` enables raw output capture:

- `AgentInput.captureRawOutput` signals adapters to collect raw stdout lines
- `AgentOutput.rawOutput` carries the lines back to the runner
- Report writer strips `rawOutput` from scenario JSON and writes it as `{agent}.raw.ndjson`

## Documentation Policy

User-facing documentation lives in `src/docs-site/` (Astro), published at https://axis.run. All changes to the CLI, scoring system, or configuration schema **must** be reflected there -the docs site is canonical and must stay in sync with the implementation.

`README.md` is intentionally lean: tagline, quick start, link tree to the docs site, and the programmatic API surface. Don't expand it back into a full reference -update the docs site instead.

| Change Type                         | Where to update                                               |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| New/modified CLI flags or commands  | `src/docs-site/src/pages/cli.astro`                           |
| New/modified config fields          | `src/docs-site/src/pages/configuration.astro`                 |
| New/modified scenario schema fields | `src/docs-site/src/pages/configuration.astro`                 |
| Scoring algorithm changes           | `src/docs-site/src/pages/scoring.astro`                       |
| Adapter contract / built-in changes | `src/docs-site/src/pages/running.astro`                       |
| Report / baseline format changes    | `src/docs-site/src/pages/running.astro` + `cli.astro`         |
| New/modified public exports         | `README.md` Programmatic API section (kept here, not in docs) |

## Build & Test

```bash
rm -rf dist && npm run build   # Always clean build -stale dist/ causes subtle issues
npm test                       # vitest, all unit tests
```

## Workspace / Home isolation

Per-job temp layout (see `createWorkspace` in `runner.ts`):

```
/tmp/axis-<rand>/
  ├── work/   ← agent cwd (only scenario-provided files; what the agent scans)
  └── home/   ← agent HOME — .codex/, .claude/, .gemini/, .qwen/, user-scoped skills, MCP config
```

- Adapter `isolationEnv` MUST place `*_HOME`-style paths under `home`, never `workspace`, so the agent doesn't see its own config when scanning files
- `HOME` is set to `home`. `AXIS_WORKSPACE` is `workspace`. Lifecycle scripts can read both
- Claude Code's MCP config is written to `home/.claude/mcp.json` and wired with `--mcp-config <path>` (no `.mcp.json` in cwd)
- Claude/Claude-SDK skills go to `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/skills/` (under `home`); Gemini skills go to `GEMINI_CLI_HOME/skills/` (under `home`)
- **Codex skills are the one exception**: Codex only discovers skills under `.agents/skills/` in cwd, so they live in `workspace`. Scenarios opting into Codex skills accept this limited visibility
- Artifact capture walks `workspace` only — agent config never leaks into report artifacts

## Gotchas

- Always clean `dist/` before testing changes -stale JS in dist can mask TypeScript errors
- Use `getUTCHours()` for timestamp IDs -`getHours()` gives local time
- Ink renders async -need 100ms yield before unmount to flush final state
- Gemini CLI streams assistant messages as deltas (`delta: true`) -adapter accumulates them
- Gemini `settings.json` must disable context discovery (`discoveryMaxDirs: 0`) or Gemini will scan the workspace tree before addressing the prompt, adding latency and unnecessary tool calls
- Runner emits initial `onJobUpdate` AFTER pre-flight to avoid ink cursor corruption
- The `close` event listener must be registered BEFORE readline to avoid missing it
- Live token counter uses `chars / 5` (intentionally conservative) so the UI never has to reverse; runner enforces monotonicity in `updateTokens`
- `setupOutput` / `teardownOutput` (captured from `$AXIS_OUTPUT`) live on `RunResult` but `scoreRunResult` returns a fresh `ScoredRunResult` -`cli.ts` re-propagates them onto the scored copy alongside `artifacts`, otherwise they vanish from the manifest
- Run-level `beforeAll` / `afterAll` hooks (on `AxisConfig`) fire from `cli.ts` -not the programmatic `run()` API. `beforeAll` runs before `initReport`; `afterAll` runs after `finalizeReport` so `$AXIS_REPORT_DIR/report.json` is on disk. Both abort the run on failure
