# VibeTiles

A click-drag window tiler for KDE Plasma 6 / KWin on Wayland. Hold a global
shortcut (default Meta+Alt+D), a fullscreen (or compact) grid overlay
appears, drag a rectangle across grid cells, release, and the
previously-active window snaps to that region.

Ships as a **declarative KWin script** (`kwinscript/`) — no compiler, no
Qt6/KF6 dev headers, just symlink one directory into
`~/.local/share/kwin/scripts/` and enable it. An earlier standalone Qt6/KF6
daemon was deleted in `baad1e7`; some code comments still cite its
`main.cpp` line numbers as the origin of a ported algorithm (historical
attributions only, that file is gone).

## Architecture

Everything runs inside `kwin_wayland` via Plasma 6's declarative KWin script
API (`X-Plasma-API: declarativescript`) — a full `QQmlEngine` with
privileged, synchronous access to `Workspace.*`. No D-Bus, no daemon.

- **`kwinscript/metadata.json`** — KPackage metadata. `KPlugin.Id` /
  `X-KDE-PluginKeyword` is both the kwinrc config-group key
  (`[Script-<id>]`) and the cache key for KWin's compiled-QML cache — see
  "Deploy / reload".
- **`kwinscript/contents/ui/main.qml`** — the entire overlay: grid,
  drag/snap, compact mode, title bar, multi-monitor picker,
  overlap-resize/relocate on commit, hot corners, drag-triggered
  activation, auto-trigger-on-drag, linked resize, expand-to-fill. Root is
  `PlasmaCore.Dialog` (a plain `QtQuick Window` gets silently swallowed by
  the script host, confirmed live).
- **`kwinscript/contents/ui/components/Shortcuts.qml`** — `ShortcutHandler`s
  for the two global shortcuts, user-rebindable from System Settings →
  Shortcuts.
- **`kwinscript/contents/config/main.xml`** — kcfg schema, auto-bound into
  `~/.config/kwinrc`.
- **`kwinscript/contents/ui/config.ui`** — Qt Widgets settings form (Qt
  Designer XML), rendered by KWin's built-in script-config dialog
  (`kcm_kwin4_genericscripted`) — no compiled KCM needed.

## Deploy / reload

- **`./install.sh`** — first-time setup: symlinks `kwinscript/` into
  `~/.local/share/kwin/scripts/<id>`, enables it, reconfigures KWin.
  Idempotent.
- **`./bump.sh`** — run after **every** `main.qml` edit. KWin caches
  compiled QML per plugin ID, so editing in place and reconfiguring is not
  enough. Bumps `metadata.json` to the next `vibetiles<N>`, migrates every
  kwinrc key forward, disables + unloads the old ID, verifies the new one
  loads. Check `KPlugin.Id` in `metadata.json` for the current live value.
  The live id comes from the **symlink name**, which can drift from the id in
  `metadata.json` (a fresh clone over an existing install does this). The
  rewrite therefore substitutes any `vibetiles<N>` it finds, and hard-fails if
  the file doesn't declare the new id afterwards — the symptom of that drift is
  the config dialog erroring with "could not locate package metadata".
- **`./build.sh`** — produces `vibetiles.kwinscript`, a release bundle
  under the canonical (non-numeric) id `vibetiles`, for "Install from
  File...". Doesn't touch the numbered dev install. **Don't have both
  enabled at once** — they'd register the same-named `ShortcutHandler` and
  race for the Meta+Alt+D grab. Disable the dev id first.
- **`config.ui` / `main.xml` changes** take effect immediately — just
  reopen "Configure...". `main.qml` changes need `./bump.sh`.
- **`reconfigure()` alone is not reliable for picking up a freshly-created
  plugin id** — confirmed live: enabling a brand-new `vibetiles<N>` and
  calling `org.kde.KWin.reconfigure` left `isScriptLoaded()` false and the
  previous generation kept running unchanged, silently (no error, no
  journal entry — the symptom to recognise is "edited main.qml, ran
  bump.sh, but the behavior is unchanged"). Both scripts now call
  `org.kde.kwin.Scripting.loadDeclarativeScript(path, pluginId)` explicitly
  after enabling, which loads it immediately; it's idempotent (returns
  `-1`, no duplicate `ShortcutHandler` registration) if the id is already
  loaded, so it's safe to run on every bump/install. If `bump.sh`'s
  own `isScriptLoaded` check ever comes back false again, load it by hand:
  `qdbus-qt6 org.kde.KWin /Scripting org.kde.kwin.Scripting.loadDeclarativeScript
  ~/.local/share/kwin/scripts/<id>/contents/ui/main.qml <id>`.
- **Old generations keep running after `unloadScript`, and only a KWin restart
  evicts them** — confirmed live: after unloading and even *deleting the package*
  of a generation, its instance kept handling native drags and drawing its own
  overlay, reading its own (now-orphaned) `[Script-<oldId>]` kwinrc section. The
  newest generation owns the global shortcut grab, so the symptom is a split
  personality: the shortcut drives the new code while drag-triggered paths, hot
  corners and the auto-picker still come from an old one — with the old one's
  settings, which look "impossible" against the live config section. Diagnose by
  counting instances (`qdbus-qt6 org.kde.KWin | grep '^/Scripting/Script'`)
  against installed packages (`ls ~/.local/share/kwin/scripts/`); more instances
  than packages means stale generations. `isScriptLoaded` is useless here — it
  tracks the kwinrc *enabled flag*, not the runtime, and returns true for ids
  whose package is gone. Clean up with
  `kwriteconfig6 --file kwinrc --group Plugins --key vibetiles<N>Enabled --delete`
  for every stale id, then log out/in (or restart
  `plasma-kwin_wayland.service`, which kills every Wayland app). Bumping a lot
  in one session accumulates these, so re-check before trusting any live test.
- **Never use System Settings → "Uninstall" on the dev install** — the package
  is a *symlink* into the repo, and KPackage's uninstall follows it and deletes
  `kwinscript/` from the working tree, taking uncommitted edits with it
  (happened; recovered via `git restore kwinscript`). Remove the symlink
  instead: `rm ~/.local/share/kwin/scripts/<id>`.
- D-Bus CLI binary is `qdbus-qt6` (`qdbus6` does not exist here).
- Consolidating the dev id to the canonical `vibetiles` string is possible
  now (that namespace has never loaded, so no restart needed) but would
  forfeit cache-busting for future edits — get explicit approval first.

## Gotchas

- `QComboBox` auto-binds `currentIndex` (int), not `currentText` — type
  combo-backed kcfg entries (`mode`, `hotCorner`) as `Int` and map
  index→name manually in QML.
- `QPlainTextEdit` auto-binds `plainText` — used for `monitorsJson`.
- The generic KWin-script config dialog only does 1:1 scalar binding; no
  per-row/dynamic UI. Raw-JSON `QPlainTextEdit` is the zero-build tradeoff.
- Script-owned overlay windows never reliably get real keyboard focus
  (`Keys.onEscapePressed` never fires) — the fine-grid modifier state
  (`fineHeld`, **Alt**) comes from mouse-event modifier flags, cancel is bound
  to right-click. Alt rather than Shift: Shift collided with other things in
  practice. Two consequences of sourcing it from mouse events, both confirmed
  live and both inherent, not bugs to re-investigate:
  - **The pointer has to move for the state to update.** Pressing or releasing
    Alt while the mouse is still changes nothing until the next mouse event.
    Barely noticeable mid-drag (the mouse is moving anyway), obvious if you
    hold Alt first and expect the grid to redraw.
  - **No modifier at all during native drags** (drag-triggered and
    `dragAutoTrigger` paths): the compositor keeps the pointer grab, so the
    overlay's MouseArea receives nothing. Alt-doubling is simply unavailable
    there, and **holding Alt before the drag starts doesn't help either** —
    there is nothing to read it from. Probed the host directly (confirmed
    live): `Workspace` and `KWin` expose no modifier/key/input members at all,
    `Qt.application` has only `state`/`stateChanged`, and
    `queryKeyboardModifiers` is `undefined`. Don't re-investigate this; the
    only mechanism that demonstrably fires mid-native-drag is a **global
    shortcut** (that's how drag-triggered activation works), so a fine-grid
    latch would have to be a `ShortcutHandler`, not a held modifier.
- `ShortcutHandler` has no `enabled` property (fails component load if
  assigned) — its global grab lives for the script's whole lifetime, unlike
  `ScreenEdgeHandler` which does support live `enabled:` rebinding.
- A dead kglobalaccel registration still owns its key: renaming a
  `ShortcutHandler`'s `name:` strands the old action holding the shortcut,
  and a stored `none` binding is sticky (not restored by reload). Diagnose
  with `grep -i <name> ~/.config/kglobalshortcutsrc` /
  `qdbus-qt6 org.kde.kglobalaccel | grep -i <name>`; fix via
  `org.kde.KGlobalAccel.unregister` then rebind explicitly.
- Grid snap only applies on release, never to the live preview rect
  (snapping the preview kills small-drag feedback). Snap floors/ceils
  outward, never rounds. Exception: the compact-mode ghost draws from
  `snappedRect()` deliberately, to preview the exact committed outcome.
- `Workspace.cursorPos` is always accurate — no `QCursor` focused-surface
  caveat here.
- `KWin.PlacementArea` (not raw output geometry) excludes panel/dock
  struts.
- `console.log` is silently swallowed by the script host — use
  `console.warn`/`console.error`, read via
  `journalctl --user -b --no-pager | grep vibetiles`.
- The overlay itself is in `Workspace.stackingOrder` and (drag-triggered
  path) fullscreen, so any occupancy scan must filter it out.
  `normalWindow` isn't enough — it's true for the overlay too. Use the
  shared `isRealWindow()` predicate (keys off empty `resourceClass`) for
  *every* window scan; divergent filters between scans is how this bug hid
  before.
- Don't measure occupancy by summing per-window overlap areas —
  overlapping windows double-count and a region can read >100% occupied.
  `findFreeRegion`/`expandRectFor` test each obstacle independently in
  pixel/slot space instead (see below).
- `ydotool mousemove --absolute` is miscalibrated here; use relative
  `-x -y`. Prefer asking the user to test live via the shortcut over
  synthetic ydotool/screenshot testing.
- Run background test processes via Bash's `run_in_background: true`, not
  manual `&`/`disown` (unreliable here).
- Restarting `plasma-kwin_wayland.service` crashes every running Wayland
  app — always get fresh explicit confirmation first.

## Config schema

`~/.config/kwinrc`, section `[Script-<id>]` (see `KPlugin.Id` in
`metadata.json`; all entries optional, missing = kcfg default). Edit via
System Settings → Window Management → KWin Scripts → VibeTiles →
Configure..., or `kwriteconfig6`:

| entry | type | default | notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `gridCols` | Int | 6 | |
| `gridRows` | Int | 4 | |
| `mode` | Int | 0 | 0=fullscreen, 1=compact |
| `compactWidth` | Int | 480 | px; swapped with `compactHeight` on a portrait monitor |
| `compactHeight` | Int | 300 | px; swapped with `compactWidth` on a portrait monitor |
| `gap` | Int | 8 | px inset applied to each edge of the final placed window |
| `resizeOverlapping` | Bool | true | shrink other windows whose edge is fully covered by a new placement |
| `relocateCovered` | Bool | true | move windows a placement *completely* covers to the largest free region |
| `compactAtCursor` | Bool | false | compact mode: spawn overlay centered on the mouse cursor |
| `hotCorner` | Int | 0 | 0=none,1=topLeft,2=topRight,3=bottomLeft,4=bottomRight |
| `monitorsJson` | String | `{}` | per-output overrides, one `NAME = COLSxROWS[, WxH]` line each (legacy JSON map of name → `{gridCols, gridRows, compactWidth, compactHeight}` still accepted); the optional second pair overrides the compact size on that output |
| `dragAutoTrigger` | Bool | false | auto-show a top-center picker on any native window drag past a distance threshold |
| `linkedResize` | Bool | false | co-resize windows sharing the dragged edge |
| `autoAtCursor` | Bool | false | auto-trigger picker spawns next to the cursor (48px clear of it on the axis being dragged along) instead of fixed top-center |
| `autoExpandOnEdgeDrag` | Bool | false | Windows-Snap-style fill-on-edge-drop |
| `snapGaps` | Bool | false | after a resize or grid/compact placement, close small leftover gaps to a neighbour |
| `snapGapMax` | Int | 200 | px cap on how far a `snapGaps` edge is allowed to grow |
| `restoreSizeOnDrag` | Bool | false | give a window its pre-placement size back when it's dragged out by the titlebar |

Two global shortcuts, not kcfg entries: Meta+Alt+D (`showOverlay`) and
Meta+Alt+E (`expandToGap`), both in `Shortcuts.qml`.

## Feature notes

- **Drag-triggered activation** — holding the shortcut mid-native-drag
  retargets the overlay at that window and follows the cursor
  (`dragTriggered`, `onNativeDrag*` in `main.qml`). Always forces
  fullscreen mode regardless of config — a deliberate product decision.
- **Auto-trigger on drag** (`dragAutoTrigger`) — a small top-center picker
  appears on any native drag past a 24px threshold, no shortcut needed.
  Selection needs the cursor to first cross into the picker bounds
  (`pointInCanvas`) to pin an anchor, since a native drag only ever
  delivers one point. Re-homes to a new screen mid-drag if the cursor
  crosses monitors.
- **Relocating covered windows** (`relocateCovered`) — a window a new
  placement *completely* covers (not just an edge slice) is moved instead
  of left hidden underneath. `findFreeRegion()` is pixel-accurate
  (coordinate-compression over obstacle edges in slot space, same
  technique as `expandRectFor`), not grid-quantized — off-grid gaps are
  measured at their true size. Spot preference, in order: the **vacated
  slot** grid-snapped (`snapRectToGrid`) if that rect is free — dropping A
  onto B is a swap, so B belongs where A was, not in whatever unrelated
  corner is the largest empty rectangle; then `findFreeRegion()`; then the
  *raw* vacated rect as a last resort. That last step is deliberately last:
  for a target that was never tiled the raw rect is an arbitrary floating
  rectangle, and using it whenever the snapped form collided (the old
  fallback) made a swap onto an untiled window leave B floating — confirmed
  live. Leaves the window in place (old behavior) if none of the three
  works. One window per vacated slot; a second covered window uses the
  region search.
  The swap only works because `commit()` sets `pendingGeoms` to the placed
  window's new rect for the whole neighbour phase: `occupiedRects` reads
  `frameGeometry`, which on the same tick still reports the target at its
  *old* position, so it occupied both ends at once (stale rect over the
  vacated space, `placed` over the new home) and the region the covered
  window wanted was excluded — it landed in a leftover sliver, half-size or
  worse (confirmed live). Same staleness the `snapGaps` gap-close guards
  against, same mechanism.
  `resizeOverlappingWindows` takes the relocate pass's output as a **skip
  list** for the same reason: it re-reads `frameGeometry`, so a
  just-relocated window still reads as overlapping the placement and got
  shrunk a second time to a rect derived from where it used to be, throwing
  away the size the relocate gave it. Harmless until `coversSpan`'s epsilon
  widened to `snapGapMax` — before that the second write failed its own
  >50px remainder guard.
- **Linked resize** (`linkedResize`) — dragging a window's edge moves the
  flush edge of every window in its contiguous border chain
  (`collectBorderChain`), like a shared splitter. Neighbours clamp to
  their own min/max size rather than blocking the drag. Pure side effect
  of `interactiveMoveResize*` signals; overlay never shown.
- **Expand to fill** (`expandToGap` / `autoExpandOnEdgeDrag`) — grows the
  active window into the free space around it without moving it.
  Meta+Alt+E expands in place; native edge-drop (drag a window against a
  screen edge with the mouse) fills the reachable gap with a shadowed
  preview. A **corner** drop is that same fill clipped to the corner's
  quarter of the work area (`rectIntersect` of `expandRectFor`'s result with
  the quadrant), so obstacles still shorten it — returning the quarter
  outright made the gesture ignore windows in the way. Corners use their own
  `cornerDropThreshold` (120px) rather than `edgeDropThreshold` (16px): the
  intersection of two 16px bands is a 16x16 target nobody can hit on purpose,
  which is why the pre-existing empty-screen quarter path almost never fired. `expandRectFor()` is pixel-accurate (slot-space growth to the
  nearest obstacle edge, both axis orders tried, larger result kept).
  Deliberately scoped to the native mouse path only — it does not fire
  from a grid-overlay placement (`finishDrag`), which commits exactly the
  selected size.
- **Snap gaps** (`snapGaps`) — closes a small leftover gap left when a
  grid/compact-picker placement lands close to but not flush against a
  neighbour (typically because the neighbour was itself resized off-grid,
  outside VibeTiles). Triggered only from `finishDrag`, after its own
  exact-size commit — deliberately NOT hooked to a plain native window
  resize (confirmed live: the first version fired on *any* resize,
  including ones with nothing to do with VibeTiles, which surprised the
  user "it does it on ANY resize, not just when resizing through
  VibeTiles"). Calls `snapWindowGaps()`, which reuses `expandRectFor`'s
  slot-space growth but clamps each edge's movement to `snapGapMax`
  (user-tunable, kcfg `Int`, default 200px — an earlier fixed
  `max(64, windowGap*6)` guess was "way too little to make any real
  difference" for typical off-grid gaps) so it only eats slack up to that
  size — filling genuinely open space still requires
  `expandToGap`/`autoExpandOnEdgeDrag`. Growth that reaches the work-area
  boundary rather than stopping at a real obstacle window is excluded
  entirely (checked by comparing `expandRectFor`'s returned edge against
  `availGeo`'s), not just left uncapped — without that exclusion a window
  sitting near a screen edge with no neighbour at all crept toward that
  edge by up to `snapGapMax` on every trigger, confirmed live.
  Complementary to `linkedResize`, not overlapping: that one applies to
  any native resize and co-moves a neighbour already flush against the
  dragged edge; this one only follows a VibeTiles placement and grows the
  placed window itself toward a neighbour that isn't.
  With `snapGaps` on, it also widens the tolerance the *neighbour* passes
  use: `coversSpan()` decides whether an overlap counts as a clean edge
  slice, and its 24px alignment epsilon becomes `snapGapMax` (plus a "≤40%
  of that dimension" proportional guard, so a genuinely partial overlap is
  still left alone). That makes an off-grid neighbour overhanging a
  placement by real pixels shrink (`resizeOverlappingWindows`) or relocate
  (`relocateCoveredWindows`) instead of sitting half-hidden underneath —
  previously such a window fell between the two passes, too uncovered to
  relocate and with a shrink remainder failing its own >50px guard.
  `commit()` then re-runs the gap-close on the placed window itself, so it
  absorbs the sliver the retreat just freed. That second growth reads
  neighbour geometry from `pendingGeoms` (the rects the two passes just
  wrote), never a read-back: `frameGeometry` still returns the pre-move
  rect on the same tick, which reads as an obstacle overlapping the placed
  window, and `expandRectFor` bails outright on an overlapping obstacle —
  confirmed live as "the drop does nothing, re-dropping on the same cells
  works". Same class of staleness `presetFg` already guards against for
  the placed window's own geometry.

- **Restore size on drag** (`restoreSizeOnDrag`) — Windows' "unsnap": `commit()`
  snapshots the window's size just before every placement into `restoreGeoms`
  (an array keyed by the window object, same pattern as `hookedWindows` —
  window ids are QUuids and don't work as JS keys), and
  `onNativeDragStarted` hands it back on a plain titlebar move. Never
  overwrites an existing entry, so re-tiling an already-placed window still
  points at the size from before VibeTiles first touched it, not at the
  intermediate tile. One-shot (the entry is consumed on restore); a hand
  resize (`win.resize`) drops the entry instead, since the user picking a size
  supersedes the memory. The restore keeps the top edge and the cursor's
  *fractional* x within the frame, so the pointer stays on the titlebar as it
  shrinks — writing `frameGeometry` from inside
  `interactiveMoveResizeStarted` works because KWin re-derives its own
  interactive move offset as a fraction on geometry change (confirmed live).

## Theme awareness

Overlay colors track the active Plasma color scheme via
`Kirigami.Theme.colorSet: Complementary` (`mainItem`, same set Plasma's own
OSDs use) instead of being hardcoded. All colors reference
`Kirigami.Theme.*` properties, usually through the `themeAlpha(c, a)`
helper. `titleBar`/`pickerPanel`/compact-mode `canvas` get a `MultiEffect`
drop shadow; fullscreen `canvas` skips it (no edge to read a shadow
against).

## Not yet done / known gaps

- **Keyboard-only placement** (`Meta+Alt+Arrow` to move/grow a selection,
  `Meta+Alt+Return` to commit) was attempted and reverted — confirmed live
  that it didn't work, but the actual failure mode was never isolated. If
  revisited, instrument `onActivated` directly before assuming the
  planned data flow (reusing `dragStart`/`dragCurrent`/`dragging`) was
  itself at fault.
- Drag-triggered activation's mid-drag monitor re-homing restarts the
  selection on the new screen rather than preserving it — added
  speculatively, feel unvalidated.
