# PhD Research Repository — Project Rules

## What This Is

A multi-project PhD repository focused on **holonic demanufacturing coordination under structural uncertainty**, combining discrete-event simulation, digital twin architectures, conservative learning, formal DES/supervisory-control guarantees, and LLM-mediated coordination.

## Research Domain

End-of-life electronics demanufacturing — automated disassembly lines where product variety, component degradation, and runtime surprises create **structural uncertainty** (uncertainty over which actions are even feasible, not just parametric noise). The work spans 5 papers/work packages from DES modeling through system-level evaluation.

## Source of Truth

- **Simulation code is the ground truth.** Claims in papers/thesis must be grounded in verifiable simulation outputs and event logs.
- **No lookahead — ever.** Every decision, belief update, or action selection at time T must use only events and observations with timestamps ≤ T.
- **Causal correctness is non-negotiable.** Simulation events must respect process ordering; no retroactive state modifications.
- **Reproducibility is mandatory.** Every experiment must be reproducible from a seed + config + code version.

## Conventions

- Prefer **vectorized NumPy/Pandas** over row-by-row loops where applicable.
- Prefer **YAML or JSON configs** for all scenario parameters — never hardcode.
- Simulation parameters (distributions, capacities, probabilities) must be **calibratable** and clearly marked when assumed.
- Every simulation run must produce a **reproducible event log** (events.csv or equivalent).
- Use **seeds** for all stochastic elements; document seed policy in configs.
- Do not introduce ML/LLM components unless explicitly requested or they are part of the mediation gate architecture.

## Simulation Integrity

- Events must be **causally ordered** — no retroactive state changes.
- Resource constraints must be **enforced**, not approximated.
- Exception handling (jams, failures, unknown products) must be modeled explicitly.
- Monitor/logging must not alter simulation behavior (observer pattern only).
- Warm-up periods must be documented and excluded from steady-state metrics.

## Formal Correctness

- **Supervisor-enabled set**: every action executed must be in the supervisor-enabled set at that state.
- **No-new-behavior containment**: the executed language must be a subset of the supervisor's closed-loop language.
- **Zero containment violations** is the target across all uncertainty regimes.
- Belief updates must be **monotonically refining** — never expand the feasible set without new evidence.

## Reproducibility

- Every experiment result referenced in a paper must be reproducible via: `seed + config + code commit`.
- Event logs (events.csv) are immutable once produced — never overwrite, only append new runs.
- Metadata files (metadata.json) must record: config used, seed, code version, timestamp, runtime.

## Security

- Never hardcode API keys or secrets — use environment variables.
- MQTT brokers for digital twin experiments must use local/test instances only.
