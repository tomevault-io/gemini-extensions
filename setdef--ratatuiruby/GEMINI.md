## Project Identity

Project Name: ratatui_ruby

Description: A high-performance Ruby wrapper for the Ratatui TUI library.

Architecture:

- **Frontend (Ruby):** Pure `Data` objects (Ruby 3.2+) used in Frames and/or defining the View Tree. Immediate mode.
- **Backend (Rust):** A generic renderer using `ratatui` and `magnus` that traverses the Ruby `Data` tree and renders to the terminal buffer.

## Stability & Compatibility

- **Project Status:** Pre-1.0. 
- **User Base:** First external users (as of 2026-01-03).
- **Breaking Changes:** Backward compatibility is **NOT YET** a priority. Since there are few external users, you are encouraged to refactor APIs for better ergonomics and performance even if it breaks existing code. This will when we ship v1.0.0.
- **Requirement:** All breaking changes **MUST** be explicitly documented in the [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)'s **Unreleased** section to ensure transparency as the project evolves toward 1.0. Migration guides **MUST** be included in `doc/` when we release a new minor version.

## 1. Standards

### STRICT REQUIREMENTS

- **Check Before Implementing:** FIRST check tests for existing coverage. If it works, say so and point to the test.
- Every file MUST begin with an SPDX-compliant header. License by directory: `LGPL-3.0-or-later` for library source (`lib/`, `ext/`, `test/`, `sig/`); `MIT-0` for widget and verify examples (`examples/widget_*`, `examples/verify_*`); `AGPL-3.0-or-later` for app examples, tasks, and tooling (`examples/app_*`, `tasks/`, `bin/`); `CC-BY-SA-4.0` for documentation. `reuse annotate` can help you generate the header. **For Ruby files**, wrap SPDX comments in `#--` / `#++` to hide them from RDoc output.
- Every line of Ruby MUST be covered by tests that would stand up to mutation testing.
  - Tests must be meaningful and verify specific behavior or rendering output; simply verifying that code "doesn't crash" is insufficient and unacceptable.
  - **Prefer snapshot tests** (`assert_snapshots`, plural) over manual `buffer_content` assertions for UI widgets. Snapshots are self-documenting and easier to maintain.
  - For UI widgets, use `with_test_terminal` and snapshot assertions to verify terminal buffer content.
- Every line of Rust MUST be covered by tests that would stand up to mutation testing.
  - Tests must be meaningful; simply verifying that code "doesn't crash" or "compiles" is insufficient and unacceptable.
  - Each widget implementation must have a `tests` module with unit tests verifying basic rendering.
- **Pre-commit:** Use `bin/agent_rake` to ensure commit-readiness. See Tools for detailed instructions.
- **Git Pager:** ALWAYS set `PAGER=cat` for ALL `git` commands (e.g., `PAGER=cat git diff`). This is mandatory.

### Tools

- **NEVER** run `bundle exec rake` directly. **NEVER** run `bundle exec ruby -Ilib:test ...` directly.
- **ALWAYS use `bin/agent_rake`** for running tests, linting, or checking compilation.
  - **Usage:**
    - Runs default task (compile + test + lint): `bin/agent_rake`
    - Runs specific task: `bin/agent_rake test:ruby` (for example)
- **Snapshot Testing:** When tests fail due to intentional behavior changes (not bugs), update snapshots:
  - **Command:** `UPDATE_SNAPSHOTS=1 bin/agent_rake test:ruby`
  - This regenerates all `snapshot/*{txt,ansi}` files to match current output
  - **When to use:** After modifying widget rendering, changing default values, or updating UI behavior
  - **When NOT to use:** For actual test failures that indicate bugs in your code
  - After updating, verify the changes make sense by reviewing the diff of `.snapshot` files
- **Setup:** `bin/setup` must handle both Bundler and Cargo dependencies.
- **Git:** ALWAYS set `PAGER=cat` with `git`, `git`, etc.. **THIS IS CRITICAL!**
- **Rake:** Our rake tasks use `git ls-files`, so errors happen when you move or delete files. In this case, ask the user to stage changes for you.

### Ruby Standards

- Use `Data.define` for all value objects (UI Nodes). (Prefer `class Foo < Data.define()` over `Foo = Data.define() do`).
- Define types in `.rbs` files. Don't use `untyped` just because it's easy; be comprehensive and accurate. Do not include `initialize` in `.rbs` files; use `self.new` for constructors instead.
- Every public Ruby class/method must be documented for humans in RDoc (preferred)--**not** YARD--or markdown files (fallback), and must have `*.rbs` types defined.
- Every significant architectural and design decision must be documented for contributors in markdown files. Mermaid is allowed.
- **Rust-backed methods:** For methods implemented in Rust (magnus bindings), use RDoc directives instead of empty method bodies. Use `##` followed by `:method:`, `:call-seq:`, and prose. End with `(Native method implemented in Rust)`. See `lib/ratatui_ruby.rb` for examples.
- Refer to [doc/contributors/design/ruby_frontend.md](doc/contributors/design/ruby_frontend.md) for detailed design philosophy regarding the Immediate Mode paradigm including Data-Driven UI and Frames.

### Rust Standards

- **Crate Type:** `cdylib`.
- **Bindings:** Use [magnus](https://github.com/matsadler/magnus).
- **Platform:** Support macOS (Apple Silicon), Linux, and Windows.
- Refer to [doc/contributors/design/rust_backend.md](doc/contributors/design/rust_backend.md) for detailed implementation guidelines, module structure, and rendering logic.

## 2. Directory Structure Convention

The project follows a standard Gem layout with an `ext/` directory for Rust code and `examples/` for example application-level code.

## 3. Configuration & Tooling

### Development Environment

- **Scripting Preference:** Simple `sed` or shell one-liners are fine. When a one-off script grows to multiple lines of logic, prefer a temporary rake task or `ruby -e '...'` over a multi-line shell script in a string. Ruby's `File.read`/`File.write`, `Dir.glob`, and regex handle complex transformations more cleanly.

### Documentation

- **The `doc/` folder contains source markdown files** that are included in RDoc output.
- Documentation should separate "User Guide" (Ruby API for TUI developers) from "Contributor Guide" (Ruby/Rust/Magnus internals).
  - Files within `doc/contributors/` are for library developers.
  - Files within `doc/` outside of `conttributors/` are for application developers and users of this RubyGEm.
- **Style Guide:** You **MUST** follow the [Documentation Style Guide](doc/contributors/documentation_style.md). This dictates the Alexandrian/Zinsser prose style and strict RDoc formatting required for all public API documentation.
- DON'T write .md files for something RDoc (Ruby) or rustdoc (Rust) can generate. DO use RDoc and rustdoc for documentation.


## 4. Committing

- Who commits: DON'T stage (DON'T `git add`) unless explicitly instructed. DON'T commit unless explicitly instructed. DO suggest a commit message when you finish, even if not instructed..
- When: Before reporting the task as complete to the user, suggest the commit message.
- What: Consider not what you remember, but EVERYTHING in the `git diff` and `git diff --cached`.
- **Format:**
    - Format: Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).
    - Body: Explanation if necessary (wrap at 72 chars).
        - Explain why this is the implementation, as opposed to other possible implementations.
        - Skip the body entirely if it's rote, a duplication of the diff, or otherwise unhelpful.
        - **DON'T list the files changed or the edits made in the body.** Don't provide a bulleted list of changes. Use prose to explain the problem and the solution.
        - **DON'T use markdown syntax** (no backticks, no bolding, no lists, no links). The commit message must be plain text.
- **Type conventions by directory:**
    - `lib/`, `ext/`, `sig/`: Use `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `perf` as appropriate.
    - `bin/`, `tasks/`, `.builds/`, CI/CD: Use `chore` for tooling internal to developing this gem. Use `feat`/`fix` for user-facing executables or changes that affect downstream users.
    - `examples/`: Always `docs` (documentation by example).
    - `test/`: Use `test` for new/changed tests, or match the type of the code being tested.
    - `doc/`: Always `docs`.
  
### 5. Changelog

- Follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)
- Follow the [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) specification.
- **What belongs in CHANGELOG:** Only changes that affect **application developers** or **higher-level library developers** who use or depend on `ratatui_ruby`:
    - New public APIs or widget parameters
    - Backwards-incompatible type signature changes, or behavioral additions to type signature changes
    - Observable behavior changes (rendering, styling, layout)
    - Deprecations and removals
    - Breaking changes
- **What does NOT belong in CHANGELOG:** Internal or non-behavioral changes that don't affect downstream users:
    - Test additions or improvements
    - Documentation updates, RDoc fixes, markdown clarifications
    - Refactors of internal code
    - New or modified example code
    - Internal tooling, CI/CD, or build configuration changes
    - Code style or linting changes
    - Performance improvements that affect applications
- Changelogs should be useful to downstream developers (both app and library developers), not simple restatements of diffs or commit messages.
- The Unreleased section MUST be considered "since the last git tag". Therefore, if a change was done in one commit and undone in another (both since the last tag), the second commit should remove its changelog entry.
- **Location:** New entries ALWAYS go in `## [Unreleased]`. Never edit past version sections (e.g., `## [0.4.0]`)—those are frozen history.

## 6. Definition of Done (DoD)

Before considering a task complete and returning control to the user, you **MUST** ensure:

0. **Production Ready:** RBS types are complete and accurate (no `untyped`), errors are handled with good DX, documentation follows guidelines, high code quality (no "pre-existing debt" excuses).
1.  **Default Rake Task Passes:** Run `bin/agent_rake` (no args). Confirm it passes with ZERO errors **or warnings**.
  - You will save time if you run `bin/agent_rake rubocop:autocorrect` first.
  - If you think the rake is looking for deleted files, STOP EVERYTHING and tell the user.
2.  **Documentation Updated:** If public APIs or observable behavior changed, update relevant RDoc, rustdoc, `doc/` files, `README.md`, and/or `ratatui_ruby-wiki` files.
3.  **Changelog Updated:** If public APIs, observable behavior, or gemspec dependencies have changed, update [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)'s **Unreleased** section.
4.  **Commit Message Suggested:** You **MUST** ensure the final message to the user includes a suggested commit message block. This is NOT optional.
  - You MUST also check `git log -n1` to see the current standard AI footer ("Generated  with" and "Co-Authored-By") and include it in your suggested message.
