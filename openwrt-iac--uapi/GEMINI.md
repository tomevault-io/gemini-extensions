# uapi

Native, lightweight, production-grade HTTP REST API for OpenWrt. Translates standard REST verbs into ubus calls so modern edge routers become first-class targets for Infrastructure-as-Code workflows. Primary design validation: serving as the backend for the openwrt-iac Terraform provider.

This file is the every-turn meta document: project identity, non-negotiable principles, code-style and workflow rules, plus a pointer table to topic-specific docs under `docs/`. Topical normative content (process model, transaction recipe, auth, error envelope, observability, testing, packaging, versioning) lives in the corresponding `docs/<topic>.md` file. When in doubt, the table at the bottom of this file is the index.

## Architectural principles (non-negotiable)

1. **Native integration (direct-to-bus).** Communicate with OpenWrt via ubus through the ucode runtime. No intermediate proxy daemons. No direct `/etc/config/` file manipulation; all writes go through uci's API.
2. **Zero-bloat footprint.** Target is resource-constrained embedded hardware. Runtime overhead, memory, and storage stay negligible. Reject dependencies that don't earn their keep.
3. **Atomic transactions.** A single HTTP write request stages → validates → commits → reloads in one transaction. No partial-failure states, no config drift.
4. **Report state, never correct it.** A read answers what uci holds *and* what the daemon is actually doing, and says so when they disagree (`network/interfaces.effective_proto` is the shape). A write reports whether the effect landed, not merely that the intent was stored (`X-Kernel-Status`). uapi never repairs drift on its own: there is no loop to host one, and the IaC tool above it already is that loop, so a second corrector would fight the first. Persistence is uci's job, boot-time convergence is the daemon's, and being trustworthy about both is uapi's.

Before adopting any library, daemon, persistence layer, or abstraction, check it against these four. Prefer ucode-native solutions; flag anything requiring a long-running auxiliary process, direct `/etc/config/` writes, splitting a logical state change across multiple HTTP requests, or a timer or background pass that would make uapi correct drift rather than report it.

**Aim.** Every change should move uapi closer to state-of-the-art for an embedded HTTP control plane: correctness, observability, security posture, test discipline, lock-and-state hygiene, drift detection. The roadmap (`docs/roadmap.md`) is not aspirational backlog; it is the gap between today's posture and that target. Prefer hardening that closes a real gap over a feature that adds wire surface for its own sake.

**Design reference: LuCI.** When a design choice is non-obvious (should this field be required? what should happen on a proto switch? how is this option meant to interact with that one?), read LuCI's source for the same surface before deciding. The OpenWrt SDK feeds carry it at `build/sdk/feeds/luci/`; the form/view code under `modules/luci-mod-*/htdocs/luci-static/resources/view/` and the platform abstractions under `modules/luci-base/htdocs/luci-static/resources/` are the two main entry points. LuCI is the long-baked baseline every OpenWrt operator already lives with; matching its behavior is the safe default. *Deliberately* diverging from it is fine when the divergence is a documented improvement; *accidentally* diverging because we didn't check is the failure mode to avoid.

## Code and documentation style

- **Priorities, in order:** simplicity, maintainability, modularity, readability.
- **No em-dashes.** Applies to code, comments, docs, commit messages, and design notes.
- **Comments are rare.** Default to writing none. Naming and structure should carry the meaning.
- **When a comment is necessary, explain why, not what.** A reader can see what the code does; what they cannot see is the non-obvious constraint, invariant, or workaround that motivated the choice.

### Avoid AI slop (HIGH IMPORTANCE)

Slop is plausible-looking ceremony that adds no signal. It is the single most common failure mode for AI-generated patches and the most expensive to remove in review. Treat every line you write or accept as carrying a justification cost. Apply ruthlessly:

- **No narration headers.** No "What this file does" preambles, no `// ---- section ----` banner comments, no multi-paragraph docstrings explaining the obvious. The filename and the first function are the header.
- **No what-comments.** Anything a competent reader can read directly off the code (`// Loop over keys`, `// Check if X is null`, `// Cleanup`) is slop. Delete it.
- **One-call-site helpers are suspect.** A helper that wraps a single-line operation in a function is slop unless naming it adds real meaning. Inline.
- **Defensive code for cases that cannot happen** (given the rest of the code, not the universe) is slop. Either prove the case is reachable and handle it, or delete the guard.
- **Tautological assertions** that always pass given how the data was constructed earlier in the test are slop. Delete or replace with a real check.
- **Ceremonial echoes / printfs** in scripts ("starting X", "finished X") are slop unless the script genuinely needs progress narration for a long-running task.
- **Variables named to give a name to a value used once** are slop unless the name carries non-obvious meaning.
- **Phrases like "we intentionally", "this is by design", "for clarity", "in order to"** are usually slop tells. Read those comments again; most should be deleted.

The bar for every comment, helper, variable, and assertion: **a senior engineer reading this asks "why is this here?" and gets a non-obvious answer.** If the answer is obvious, delete.

Load-bearing WHY comments stay: historical bug context, hidden constraints, workarounds for upstream behavior, lock-acquire ordering, the kind of thing that would cost the next reader an hour to rediscover. Be honest about which is which.

### Branch + PR workflow

All code changes land via a PR, never via direct push to `main`. Cut a branch (`release/v<version>` for releases, `feat/<topic>` or `fix/<topic>` otherwise), push the branch, open the PR with `gh pr create --base main`, wait for CI to pass on the branch, then merge only when explicitly told. The PR is the reviewable diff; direct-pushing bypasses that gate even when CI passes locally.

Force-with-lease is permitted on the branch (typical use: amending a release commit after review fixes). Force-pushing `main` remains forbidden. Tag-creation discipline is unchanged: signed annotated tag after merge, only when explicitly told to tag.

Applies to every repo under the `openwrt-iac` org, not just uapi.

**Every PR body answers three questions.** These are not a checklist to tick; each one has caught a real defect that CI could not, so answer them with evidence and say so plainly when the answer is "no".

1. **Does this change the wire surface?** Naming the semver impact (`docs/versioning.md`) at authoring time is what stops a breaking change shipping as a patch. A new field, header or status is additive and belongs in a minor; a payload that used to be accepted and now is not is the breaking clause and needs its carve-out stated.
2. **Was it verified against a real device, or only by CI?** Both are fine answers, but they are not the same claim. Unit tests and CI pass against stubs, so anything asserting what a daemon or the kernel *did* has to be run somewhere real, and the observed output belongs in the PR.
3. **Was LuCI checked, when the change is a behaviour or design choice?** Per the design-reference rule above. Matching it is the safe default and diverging is fine, but the divergence has to be deliberate and written down, not discovered later.

There is no PR template file: PRs here are opened with `gh pr create --body`, which never reads one.

## Where the details live

CLAUDE.md is the every-turn meta document (principles, style, workflow). Topic-specific normative content lives in `docs/`:

| Topic | Primary file | Read when... |
|-------|--------------|--------------|

| Token CLI, HTTP token mint, scope syntax, raw-access composition, per-token rate limit overrides | `docs/tokens.md` | Anything auth-shaped from the operator angle. |
| Commit-confirmed apply: deferral decision + standalone-arm design (built in rc1, removed before 2.3.0 stable) | `docs/commit-confirm.md` | Picking the feature back up, or understanding why the confirm surface has not shipped. |
| Threat model, TLS posture, public endpoints, design exclusions | `docs/security.md` | Security review, threat-model questions, "why not rpcd sessions?" |
| Error envelope, top-level + field-level codes, response headers | `docs/errors.md` | Defining a new error code or auditing error shapes. |
| Observability (log categories, format, global rate limit, metrics, diagnostics, healthz, capacity) | `docs/operations.md` | Operator-facing setup, log forwarding, debugging in the field. Cross-references `docs/architecture.md` § Rate limit / Metrics for the implementation-side mechanics. |
| Test layers, harness, lint suite, CI shape | `docs/testing.md` | Designing tests, expanding lint coverage. |
| APK packaging (file layout, install hook, conffile, build steps, upgrade contract) | `docs/packaging.md` | Touching the package contract, release artifacts. |

| Semver mapping, non-breaking vs breaking changes, OpenAPI spec versioning, schema annotations | `docs/versioning.md` | Cutting a release, naming a deprecation, considering whether a change is patch / minor / major. |
| ucode quirks that have cost CI iterations | `docs/ucode-quirks.md` | Designing a new module; before assuming standard language behavior. |
| Release process (signed tags, multi-arch build, feed publication) | `docs/release-process.md` | Cutting a tag or troubleshooting a release workflow. |
| Lock-state audit (the transaction and token paths; 17 of 36 sites, see the doc) | `docs/lock-state-audit.md` | Adding a new code path that acquires a lock or opens a long-held fd. |
| Migration v1 to v2 (rename map, breaking changes) | `docs/migration-v1-to-v2.md` | Supporting operators upgrading across the v2 boundary. |
| Migration v2 to v3 (removals, the `/api/v3` prefix, schema split) | `docs/migration-v2-to-v3.md` | Supporting operators upgrading across the v3 boundary. |
| Field-level deprecation log | `docs/deprecations.md` | Renaming or removing a wire-surface field. |
| Roadmap (shipped, in-flight, deferred, out of scope) | `docs/roadmap.md` | Wondering whether something is on the table; update when an item moves between sections. |

A handful of topics span more than one file. The pointer above names the **primary** home (where the canonical contract lives); incidental coverage in other files is noted inline when relevant. If you find divergence between two files claiming the same rule, the primary is authoritative.
