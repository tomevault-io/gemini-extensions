# Locorda: AI Coding Agent Instructions

## Project Overview

**Locorda** is a Dart/Flutter library enabling offline-first applications that sync seamlessly to passive storage backends (Solid Pods, Google Drive, etc.) using state-based CRDTs for conflict-free collaboration. This is a **monorepo** using **Melos** for multipackage management.

**⚠️ Critical**: Specification in `spec/` is outdated. Implementation has diverged significantly. **Always prioritize actual code over spec documentation**.

## Agent Documentation & Lifecycle Rules

### 1. Storage & Organization
If you need it, you can generate Markdown documentation for your plans, summaries, or test reports. Follow these rules (they do not apply if I ask you explicitly to generate a markdown file for a specific purpose):
- **Primary Folder:** All agent-generated documentation must live in `.agents/`.
- **Daily Folders:** Use sub-folders formatted as `YYYY-MM-DD` (e.g., `.agents/2026-02-11/`).
- **Archive Sub-folders:** When a task or phase is completed, or if a plan is superseded by manual human code changes, move the relevant files into `.agents/YYYY-MM-DD/archive/`.

### 2. Guardrails Against "Bad Context"
- **Code is the Ground Truth:** The current state of the code in `lib/` or `src/` always overrides any notes in `.agents/`. 
- **Stale Context:** Do not follow plans in the `archive/` folder unless explicitly asked to review history. 
- **Conflict Resolution:** If you detect that the user has manually changed code in a way that contradicts a previous `.md` plan, immediately move that plan to `archive/` and generate a brief `SUPERSEDED.md` note explaining the new direction.

### 3. File Hygiene
- Use descriptive prefixes: `PLAN_`, `SUMMARY_`, `TEST_`.
- Do not clutter the root or package directories with Markdown reports.
- If the project is in a "stable" state, you may suggest a "History Compression" where you merge multiple old reports into a single `ARCHIVE_SUMMARY.md` for that date.

## 🛑 MANDATORY: Ask Before Code Edits (With Exceptions)

**CRITICAL WORKFLOW RULE**

Before calling `replace_string_in_file`, `create_file`, or any edit tool, you MUST:

1. ✅ Analyze the problem and develop a solution
2. ✅ Explain the proposed fix (show code example if helpful)
3. ⚠️ **EXPLICITLY ASK: "Shall I implement this change?"**
4. ⏸️ **WAIT for explicit approval** (user says: "yes"/"approve"/"do it")
5. ✅ Only THEN edit the file

**Exception**: When the user gives a **direct, specific instruction** for exactly what to do:
- ✅ "Translate this document to English" → Just do it
- ✅ "Rename variable X to Y" → Just do it
- ✅ "Add parameter Z to function F" → Just do it
- ❌ "The code has a bug" → Ask first (solution unclear)
- ❌ "Improve performance" → Ask first (approach unclear)

**This applies to everything else:**
- ✗ Bug fixes where solution is not explicitly specified → Ask first
- ✗ Refactoring/optimization without clear direction → Ask first
- ✗ New features without specific implementation → Ask first
- ✗ Test changes where approach unclear → Ask first
- ✗ "Obvious" fixes where action not specified → Ask first

**No rationalizations allowed:**
- "This is just a small fix" → Still ask (unless explicitly instructed)
- "The user will obviously want this" → Still ask
- "I already explained the solution" ≠ "I have permission to implement"

**Checklist before editing:**
```
□ Is this a direct instruction with clear action?
  → YES: Proceed
  → NO: Continue checklist
□ Have I explicitly asked: "Shall I implement this change?"
□ Has the user replied: "yes"/"approve"/"do it"?
□ If NO to either → STOP and ask first
```

## Architecture: 4-Layer Design

1. **Data Resource Layer**: Clean RDF using standard vocabularies (schema.org)
2. **Merge Contract Layer**: Property-level CRDT rules via `sync:` and `algo:` vocabularies
3. **Indexing Layer**: Performance via sharded indices (`idx:` vocab) - supports FullIndex (monolithic) and GroupIndex (partitioned)
4. **Sync Strategy Layer**: App-controlled sync patterns with RootResourceFetchPolicy (onRequest/prefetch)

**Key Innovation**: Hybrid Logical Clocks combine causality tracking (logical time) with intuitive tie-breaking (physical timestamps).

## Package Structure

```
packages/
├── locorda           # Main entry point, docs, examples
├── locorda_core      # Platform-agnostic CRDT sync engine (pure Dart)
├── locorda_annotations # CRDT merge strategy annotations  
├── locorda_drift     # Drift (SQLite) storage backend
├── locorda_solid     # Solid Pod integration utilities
├── locorda_solid_auth # Solid authentication (Flutter + solid-auth)
└── locorda_solid_ui  # Flutter UI components (login, sync status)
```

**Dependency Rule**: No circular deps, no re-exports between packages, clean separation.

## Essential Commands

rm -f ~/Library/Containers/dev.locorda.example.personalNotesApp/Data/Documents/*.sqlite*
```

## Development Workflow Rules

### 🚨 CRITICAL: Discussion-First Approach

**Before implementing ANY repository edit:**
1. **Stop and discuss** - Always ask "Shall I implement this?" before ANY code change
2. **Start minimal** - Design for actual example app needs, not theoretical requirements
3. **Avoid over-engineering** - No complex schemas/hierarchies without explicit approval
4. **Iterative refinement** - Basic working API first, then add complexity if needed

**This rule covers ALL edits, including:**
- Bug fixes and error corrections
- Performance optimizations
- Refactoring and code cleanup
- New features and APIs
- Test modifications
- Documentation changes in code files

**Example workflow:**
```
You: "I found a bug in X. The fix would be to change Y to Z. Shall I implement this?"
User: "yes" / "approve" / "do it"
You: [Now you may edit]
```

**What NOT to do**: 
- ✗ Implementing "obvious" fixes without asking
- ✗ Making changes while explaining the problem
- ✗ Assuming silence = approval

### 🚫 Truthfulness & Requirement Fidelity (Mandatory)

If a requirement cannot be implemented exactly as requested, the agent MUST:
1. State this explicitly and immediately (no ambiguity).
2. Explain the concrete technical constraint briefly.
3. Present viable alternatives with trade-offs.
4. Ask for a user decision before changing requirements or behavior.

Hard rules:
- ✗ Never silently change requirements.
- ✗ Never claim a requirement is implemented when it is not fully implemented.
- ✗ Never report success without verification of the exact requested outcome.
- ✗ Never substitute a “close enough” implementation without explicit approval.

Required escalation wording:
- "I cannot implement this requirement exactly with the current constraints."
- "Here are the consequences and options. Which option do you want?"

### Code Patterns

**CRDT Types**: LWW-Register (single-value), OR-Set (multi-value, re-addable), 2P-Set (permanent removal), Immutable (strict), G-Register (max wins)

**Repository-Based Hydration** - Main sync pattern:
```dart
// Repository provides callbacks for sync integration
syncSystem.hydrateStreaming<Note>(
  getCurrentCursor: () => repo.getCurrentCursor(),
  onUpdate: (graph, id) => repo.saveFromGraph(graph, id),
  onDelete: (id) => repo.deleteById(id),
  onCursorUpdate: (cursor) => repo.saveCursor(cursor),
);
```

**Save/Delete Operations**:
```dart
syncSystem.save<Note>(note);         // Triggers CRDT merge + sync
syncSystem.deleteDocument<Note>(id); // Framework-level deletion
```

**Deletion Philosophy**:
- **Framework deletion**: For storage optimization and retention policies (use sparingly)
- **Application soft deletion**: Domain-specific (`archived: true`, `hidden: true`) - preferred for user actions
- Both can coexist: soft deletion for UI, framework deletion for backend cleanup

### RDF & Semantic Web Focus

- Fragment identifiers (`it`) distinguish things from documents
- RDF reification for deletion tombstones (semantically correct vs RDF-Star)
- Public merge contracts for cross-app interoperability
- Standard vocabularies: `schema:`, `crdt:`, `algo:`, `sync:`, `idx:`

### Testing Patterns

**Record Mode**: Some tests support `RECORD_MODE=true dart test` to regenerate expected results
- Currently: `sync_engine_test.dart` (graph sync expectations)
- **Always** review `git diff` before committing record mode changes
- Used when test logic or CRDT behavior intentionally changes

**Test Structure**: Comprehensive coverage using JSON test suites (`packages/locorda_core/test/assets/graph/all_tests.json`)

## Key Files & Locations

### Documentation
- `CLAUDE.md` - Development guidelines (this project's primary dev guide)
- `IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Package structure & workflow
- `spec/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` - Original architectural spec (⚠️ outdated)
- `spec/docs/CRDT-SPECIFICATION.md` - HLC mechanics & algorithms (⚠️ outdated)
- `spec/docs/GROUP-INDEXING.md` - Indexing system patterns

### RDF Vocabularies
- `spec/vocabularies/crdt-algorithms.ttl` - CRDT merge algorithms
- `spec/vocabularies/crdt-mechanics.ttl` - Framework infrastructure (HLC, installations)
- `spec/vocabularies/idx.ttl` - Indexing vocabulary
- `spec/vocabularies/sync.ttl` - Synchronization vocabulary
- `spec/mappings/core-v1.ttl` - Essential CRDT mappings (imported by all apps)

### Core Implementation
- `packages/locorda_core/lib/src/sync_engine.dart` - Main API facade (`SyncEngine`)
- `packages/locorda_core/lib/src/crdt_document_manager.dart` - CRDT merge logic
- `packages/locorda/example/personal_notes_app` - Personal notes app (reference implementation)

## Code Quality Standards

- **Clean & minimal** - No legacy/backwards compatibility burden in this early phase
- **Idiomatic Dart** - Follow language conventions, use type system effectively
- **No over-engineering** - Solve actual problems, not theoretical ones
- **Documentation**: DartDoc for APIs + guides/examples for concepts
- **Format before commits**: `melos format`
- **Early dev phase**: Just delete wrong code, don't preserve it

## Scale & Constraints

- **Target**: 2-100 installations (optimal: 2-20) - personal to small team collaboration
- **Single-user storage focus**: CRDT sync within one user's backend (multi-user backend in v2/v3)
- **Passive storage**: All sync logic client-side, backend is simple file storage

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ Assuming spec documentation matches implementation  
❌ Creating complex abstractions without discussing design first  
❌ Over-engineering for theoretical future requirements  
❌ Generic advice without project-specific context  
❌ Breaking existing functionality with changes  
❌ Committing record mode test output without reviewing diffs

## When in Doubt

1. Check `CLAUDE.md` for development philosophy
2. Look at `packages/locorda/example/personal_notes_app` for usage patterns
3. Ask before implementing - discuss API design first
4. Run tests frequently during development
5. Keep it simple - solve real needs, not imagined ones
