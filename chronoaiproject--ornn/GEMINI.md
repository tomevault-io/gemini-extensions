# CLAUDE.md — chrono-ornn

## Product Positioning

**Ornn is an agent-facing skill-lifecycle API, not a human marketplace.**

The primary customer is the AI agent developer / agentic-system builder. Agents call Ornn directly — over HTTP or MCP — to manage their own skill lifecycle: search → pull → install → execute → build → upload → share. Closest analog: **npm registry + npm CLI fused, model-agnostic** (works for Claude / GPT / Gemini / custom — not locked to one model runtime).

Implications when proposing or building features:

- Lead with the **agent-API contract** (REST / MCP ergonomics, stable schemas, model-agnostic guarantees) before any human-UX angle.
- `ornn-web` is a *secondary* surface for skill owners and platform admins — it is not the primary product. UI features that don't translate into agent-API value are deprioritized.
- Avoid feature framing that drifts toward "another skill marketplace" (social ranking, browse-style discovery, recommendation feeds, leaderboards) unless we deliberately decide to. When a feature looks marketplace-shaped, surface that tension before building.

## Tech Stack

TypeScript, Bun workspace monorepo

- **Runtime:** Bun (backend + tests), Vite (frontend dev/build)
- **Backend:** Hono
- **Frontend:** React 19, Zustand, TanStack Query, Tailwind CSS 4, Framer Motion, React Router 7
- **Database:** MongoDB 7
- **Validation:** Zod
- **Logging:** Pino
- **Testing:** Bun test (backend); Vitest + Testing Library + jsdom (frontend + TS SDK); pytest + respx (Python SDK). All run in CI — bun packages via `bun run test`, Python via a dedicated `python-sdk-test` job.

**Packages:**

| Package | Path | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| `ornn-api` | `ornn-api/` | Backend API (Bun + Hono + MongoDB) |
| `ornn-web` | `ornn-web/` | React SPA (Vite + React 19 + Zustand + TanStack Query) |
| `@chronoai/ornn-sdk` | `sdk/typescript/` | TypeScript client for `/api/v1/*` |
| `ornn-sdk` (Python) | `sdk/python/` | Python client for `/api/v1/*` (httpx) — separate release cadence |

## Architecture

- Two packages: `ornn-api` (backend) and `ornn-web` (web UI).
- All configurable values MUST be read from environment variables. Zero hardcoded config.
- For project domain knowledge (external services, skill format, etc.), see `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.

## Code Standards

- TypeScript + Bun. Follow TypeScript and Bun conventions.
- Use `Result` patterns and Zod validation. No bare `try/catch` in routes — use error middleware.
- Keep code simple. Fewer lines > more abstractions.
- All code MUST include sufficient logging (Pino). `info` for lifecycle events, `debug` for detailed flow, `error` for failures with context.
- Logs MUST NOT contain plaintext secrets. Mask or redact sensitive values.
- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, API keys, tokens in code — ever.
- Tests: `bun run test` runs both (backend via Bun, frontend via Vitest).
- Unit tests colocated with source files. Integration tests in `tests/` directory.
- Always use Docker to run and test locally. Do not run services directly with `bun run dev`. CI builds both `ornn-api` and `ornn-web` images on every PR (`docker-build` job) so Dockerfile breakage surfaces immediately.

## Branching Strategy

- **`main`** — Production release branch. Protected: no direct push, no force push, PRs only from `develop`.
- **`develop`** — Default branch and active development branch. Contains the latest CI-passing code. Protected: no direct push, no force push, PRs from any feature branch.
- **Workflow:** `feature/xxx` → PR → `develop` → PR → `main`
- PR merge auto-deletes the source branch (protected branches excluded).
- **New work MUST branch from the latest `origin/develop`.** Every feature, bug fix, or any kind of change must start from a freshly fetched `develop` — either a new branch (`git fetch && git checkout develop && git pull && git checkout -b <name>`) or a new worktree created against `origin/develop`. Never branch off a stale local `develop` or another feature branch.

## Commit Standards

Every code change MUST respect commit size. **Multiple small, self-contained commits are always better than one big combined commit, no exceptions.**

Rules:

1. **Each commit is self-contained.** A reviewer reading just that commit's diff + message can understand what changed and why, without context from sibling commits.
2. **Each commit is small.** One logical change per commit. Schema migration is one commit. New endpoint is another. Frontend drawer is another. Old page deletion is another. Tests can ride with the code they test, but unrelated test additions get their own commit.
3. **Each commit's message is detailed.** Subject line states the change in one short sentence (≤ 72 chars). Body explains the *why*, the constraints, and any non-obvious decisions. Reference the issue when relevant (`#270`).
4. **Order matters.** Stack commits in dependency order so the tree compiles + tests pass at every commit (or as close as is practical). A reviewer should be able to `git checkout` any intermediate commit without a broken state.
5. **Don't bundle for convenience.** "These are all part of the same feature" is not a reason to combine — that's what the PR is for. The PR groups related commits; the commits decompose the change.
6. **Refactors / renames go in their own commit.** Pure refactors first, then the behaviour change on top. Never bury a bug fix inside a "drive-by cleanup" commit.

What this looks like in practice for a feature like #270 (per-provider model management):

```
feat(api): extend LlmProviderModel schema with per-surface flags (#270)
feat(api): boot migration — fold legacy models collection into per-provider arrays (#270)
feat(api): PATCH /admin/settings/llm-providers/:id/models/:modelId (#270)
feat(api): rewire /me/models picker + execute-path resolver to per-provider source (#270)
chore(api): delete domains/models/ module (#270)
feat(web): ProviderModelsDrawer with per-row toggles + per-surface defaults (#270)
feat(web): wire ProviderModelsDrawer from LlmProvidersSection, drop Default column (#270)
chore(web): drop Default model select from ProviderEditDrawer (#270)
chore(web): remove /admin/models page + AdminModelsPage + admin parts of useModels/modelsApi (#270)
docs: changeset for #270
```

Ten commits is fine. Twenty is fine. One commit covering schema + migration + new routes + old module deletion + frontend + cleanup is **not fine** — it forecloses bisection and forces the reviewer to re-do the decomposition in their head.

## Versioning & Releases

This project uses **Changesets** (`@changesets/cli`) for versioning.

- Both packages (`ornn-api`, `ornn-web`) share a unified version number (fixed mode).
- Each package has its own `CHANGELOG.md`, auto-generated with GitHub PR links.
- Release notes are published on [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/ChronoAIProject/Ornn/releases).

### During development

Every feature PR targeting `develop` MUST include a changeset:

```bash
bun changeset
```

Select affected package(s), semver bump level (`patch` / `minor` / `major`), write a short description. Commit the generated `.changeset/*.md` file with the PR. CI (`check-changeset.yml`) blocks PRs that don't include one — use `bun changeset --empty` for docs-only / CI-only PRs.

### Cutting a release

Fully automated on the `main` side. No local script to run — developer action is "open a PR, review a PR". `.github/workflows/changeset-release.yml` is a state machine driven by `push: main`.

**Step 0 — Curate release notes.** Before opening the develop → main PR, the maintainer creates a dated release-notes file:

```bash
cp .github/release-notes-template.md .github/release-notes-$(date -u +%Y%m%d).md
# edit the new file — replace each `(write here)` with user-facing bullets
git add .github/release-notes-*.md && git commit && git push
```

The template (`.github/release-notes-template.md`) is immutable — it stays in the repo and supplies the format / instructions for future releases. The dated file (`.github/release-notes-<yyyymmdd>.md`) is per-release; after release it stays in the repo as a historical record. The release workflow reads the most recent dated file at release time and uses it as the GitHub Release body (HTML comment block stripped, CHANGELOG-link footer appended automatically). The CI gate `.github/workflows/check-release-notes.yml` fails the develop → main PR if no dated file exists, if any of `## Fixed` / `## New Feature` / `## Changed` is missing, or if the `(write here)` placeholder is still in the file.

Each dated file has three sections — see the template's comment block for the formatting rules. The short version: one bullet = one product-level fact, 6–12 words; cluster purely-technical items into a single trailing `Few technical bugs fixed` / `Technical enhancement` bullet per section; no PR / issue refs, no version numbers.

**Step 1 — Promote `develop` → `main`.** Open a PR `develop → main` and merge it. Regular PR; it carries whatever features + unconsumed `.changeset/*.md` files + the new `release-notes-<yyyymmdd>.md` file have piled up on `develop` since the last release.

**Step 2 — Review the bot's release-bump PR.** On the `main` push from Step 1, the workflow sees pending `.changeset/*.md` files, so it:

1. Creates branch `release/v<next>` off `main`.
2. Runs `bun run version-packages` — consumes `.changeset/*.md`, bumps both `package.json` files, appends to each `CHANGELOG.md`.
3. Commits `chore: version packages → v<next>`, force-pushes the branch.
4. Opens PR `release/v<next> → main`.

Review that PR. Merge with **Squash and merge** (keeps history linear; `main` ends up with exactly one `chore: version packages → v<next>` commit).

**Step 3 — Tag + GitHub Release + sync back to `develop`.** On the `main` push from Step 2, the workflow sees no pending changesets + `ornn-api/package.json`'s version has no matching `v<version>` tag, so it:

1. Creates an annotated `v<version>` tag and pushes it.
2. Finds the most recent `.github/release-notes-<yyyymmdd>.md`, strips its HTML comment block, appends a CHANGELOG-links footer, and calls `gh release create` with that body. If no dated file exists (or it still has the `(write here)` placeholder), falls back to a short body that just links to the in-repo `CHANGELOG.md` files. A length safety check kicks the body back to the short fallback if it exceeds 120 000 chars (GitHub API caps release bodies at 125 000).
3. Creates branch `sync/post-release-v<version>` from `main`.
4. Opens PR `sync/post-release-v<version> → develop` — **auto-approved + auto-merged** by the same workflow via a direct `PUT /repos/.../pulls/:n/merge` API call with `merge_method: merge`. No human action for the sync step; the PR is a deterministic replay of a commit that already passed CI on `main`.

**Load-bearing:** the sync PR **must** land as a merge commit, not a squash. A squash-merge creates an orphan commit on `develop` whose parent is the pre-bump `develop` tip, not `main`'s bump commit. Subsequent `develop → main` PRs then show a phantom version bump because `git merge-base` walks back past the orphan. A merge commit gives `develop` two parents (previous `develop` HEAD + `main`'s bump), making `merge-base(main, develop)` = `main`'s HEAD after the sync. The workflow calls the API directly so it doesn't fall back to the repo-default merge strategy (often squash).

If branch protection blocks the auto-merge (e.g. stricter required-reviewer rules added later), the PR stays open with a warning log entry — **merge it manually via "Create a merge commit", never "Squash and merge"**.

### State summary (what the workflow does on every `main` push)

| pending `.changeset/*.md` | `v<version>` tag exists | action |
|---|---|---|
| > 0 | — | open `release/v<next> → main` |
| 0 | no | tag, create GH Release, open `sync/post-release-v<version> → develop` |
| 0 | yes | no-op (hotfix / docs / CI push without changeset) |

### Permissions

The workflow needs `contents: write` + `pull-requests: write`. At the org level, "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests" must be enabled (set April 2026).

### Hotfixes directly to main

If something lands on `main` without a changeset (emergency patch), state is "0 pending + tag exists" → no-op. No version bump. When you're back on the normal flow, add a proper changeset-carrying PR through `develop` to stamp the next version.

## Scripts

```bash
bun install          # install all dependencies
bun run test         # run backend tests
bun run lint         # run ESLint
bun run typecheck    # run TypeScript type check (frontend)
bun run build:web    # build frontend for production
```

## Local Deployment

All services run in a local Kubernetes cluster (namespace: `ornn-cluster`). K8s manifests are in `deployment/`, split into:

- `deployment/ornn-api/` and `deployment/ornn-web/` — ornn services (built from this repo)
- `deployment/dependencies/` — dependency services (pre-built images)

### Directory structure

```
deployment/
├── .env.sample.ornn              → copy to .env.ornn
├── ornn-api/                     (configmap, secret, deployment, service)
├── ornn-web/                     (deployment, service)
└── dependencies/
    ├── .env.sample.dependencies  → copy to .env.dependencies
    ├── mongodb/
    ├── minio/
    ├── opensandbox/              (Helm chart — see README.md)
    ├── nyxid-backend/
    ├── nyxid-frontend/
    ├── chrono-storage/
    └── chrono-sandbox/
```

### Service dependency order

```
Layer 1 (no dependencies):    mongodb, minio, opensandbox
Layer 2:                      nyxid-backend       → mongodb
                              chrono-storage      → minio
                              chrono-sandbox      → opensandbox
Layer 3:                      nyxid-frontend      → nyxid-backend
                              ornn-api            → mongodb, nyxid-backend
Layer 4:                      ornn-web             → ornn-api
```

### Step 1: Create namespace

```bash
kubectl create namespace ornn-cluster
```

### Step 2: Build dependency images

Clone and build the dependency services (only needed on first setup or when updating):

| Service | Repo | Build command |
|---------|------|---------------|
| nyxid-backend | `https://github.com/ChronoAIProject/NyxID.git` | `docker build -t nyxid-backend -f backend/Dockerfile .` |
| nyxid-frontend | `https://github.com/ChronoAIProject/NyxID.git` | `docker build -t nyxid-frontend -f frontend/Dockerfile frontend/` |
| chrono-storage | `https://github.com/aevatarAI/chrono-storage.git` | `docker build -t chrono-storage .` |
| chrono-sandbox | `https://github.com/aevatarAI/chrono-sandbox.git` | `docker build -t chrono-sandbox .` |

MongoDB, MinIO, and OpenSandbox use public images — no build needed.

### Step 3: Install OpenSandbox (Helm)

```bash
helm upgrade --install opensandbox \
  https://github.com/alibaba/OpenSandbox/releases/download/helm/opensandbox/0.1.0/opensandbox-0.1.0.tgz \
  --namespace opensandbox-system --create-namespace \
  -f deployment/dependencies/opensandbox/values.yaml
```

### Step 4: Create NyxID JWT keys secret

NyxID backend needs RSA keys for JWT signing. Create the secret from local PEM files:

```bash
set -a; source deployment/dependencies/.env.dependencies; set +a
kubectl create secret generic nyxid-jwt-keys \
  --from-file=private.pem="${NYXID_KEYS_DIR}/private.pem" \
  --from-file=public.pem="${NYXID_KEYS_DIR}/public.pem" \
  -n "${NAMESPACE}" --dry-run=client -o yaml | kubectl apply -f -
```

### Step 5: Deploy dependencies

```bash
set -a; source deployment/dependencies/.env.dependencies; set +a
VARS=$(grep -v '^#' deployment/dependencies/.env.dependencies | grep '=' | cut -d= -f1 | sed 's/^/$/g' | tr '\n' ',')
for dir in mongodb minio nyxid-backend nyxid-frontend chrono-storage chrono-sandbox; do
  for f in deployment/dependencies/$dir/*.yaml; do
    envsubst "$VARS" < "$f" | kubectl apply -f -
  done
done
```

### Step 6: Build ornn images (run from repo root)

```bash
# Backend
docker build -t "${ORNN_API_IMAGE}" -f ornn-api/Dockerfile .

# Frontend — runtime config (nginx + Vite env) is injected at container
# startup via the `ornn-web-config` ConfigMap. Pass `GIT_COMMIT` so the
# stale-bundle auto-reload loop has a fresh build identity baked into
# both `__APP_VERSION__` and `dist/version.json` (#318).
docker build \
  --build-arg GIT_COMMIT=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD) \
  -t "${ORNN_WEB_IMAGE}" -f ornn-web/Dockerfile .
```

### Step 7: Deploy ornn

```bash
set -a; source deployment/.env.ornn; set +a
VARS=$(grep -v '^#' deployment/.env.ornn | grep '=' | cut -d= -f1 | sed 's/^/$/g' | tr '\n' ',')
for dir in ornn-api ornn-web; do
  for f in deployment/$dir/*.yaml; do
    envsubst "$VARS" < "$f" | kubectl apply -f -
  done
done
```

### Verify

```bash
kubectl get pods -n ornn-cluster
```

### Environment variables

- `deployment/.env.sample.ornn` — ornn-api and ornn-web config. Copy to `deployment/.env.ornn`.
- `deployment/dependencies/.env.sample.dependencies` — all dependency service config. Copy to `deployment/dependencies/.env.dependencies`.

### Using the NyxID CLI against local cluster

The NyxID CLI (`nyxid`) cannot verify the local ingress TLS cert (mkcert-signed) — the binary is built without `rustls-native-certs` and has no flag to trust custom CAs. Workaround: bypass TLS via `kubectl port-forward` and use `--password` login to skip browser OAuth.

```bash
# Run in a dedicated terminal and keep alive
kubectl port-forward -n ornn-cluster svc/nyxid-backend 3001:3001

# In another terminal
nyxid login --base-url http://localhost:3001 --password --email <your-email>
```

Notes:

- `kubectl port-forward` opens a TCP tunnel from `localhost:3001` to the `nyxid-backend` service inside the cluster; closing the command closes the tunnel.
- Tokens are written to `~/.nyxid/` and persist across CLI invocations, but the port-forward must be running for any CLI call that hits the backend.
- To switch back to staging: `nyxid logout && nyxid login --base-url https://nyx-api.chrono-ai.fun`.

## Git Rules

- **Never** include `Co-Authored-By` lines in commit messages.
- **Never** auto-push without explicit user approval.
- **Never** force push.
- Single `.gitignore` at repo root only. Must ignore `.env`, `.env.*`, `*.pem`, `*.key`, `credentials.json`.

## GitHub Issue Rules

Issue tracker: https://github.com/ChronoAIProject/Ornn/issues

1. **All ornn work lives as GitHub issues.** Every feature, bug, and proposal MUST be created as an issue on the tracker above. Do NOT write proposals, task specs, or tracking docs under `docs/` — use issues.
2. **Default assignee:** every issue MUST be assigned to `chronoai-shining`.
3. **Title prefix:** every issue title MUST start with a category tag — one of `[Bug]`, `[Feature]`, `[CI/CD]`, `[Docs]`, `[Misc]`. Example: `[Feature] Skill composition & chaining`.
4. **No duplicates.** Before creating a new issue, search the existing issue list. If duplicates are found, keep one and close the others with a comment `Duplicate of #N`.
5. **PR ↔ issue linkage — load-bearing, no exceptions.**
   - Every PR MUST link to at least one GitHub issue. The PR body uses `Closes #N` / `Fixes #N` (or `Resolves #N`) so the issue auto-closes on merge — do not link with prose like "this addresses #N", that does NOT auto-close.
   - **Issue-first workflow.** Before opening a PR, check whether a matching issue already exists. If one exists: link it. If none exists: **STOP, create the issue first** with the right `[Bug]` / `[Feature]` / `[CI/CD]` / `[Docs]` / `[Misc]` title prefix, default assignee, and at least one topic label, **then** open the PR linking it. A PR without an issue link must be amended with one before merge.
   - When the PR merges, all linked issues MUST be closed (the `Closes` / `Fixes` keyword takes care of this automatically).
   - This rule applies to **every** PR — features, bugfixes, refactors, docs, CI/CD, infra, design polish. There are no "trivial enough to skip the issue" exceptions.
6. **Cross-references:** when issues are related or have an execution order, add explicit references in the issue body (`Depends on #X`, `Blocks #Y`, `Related to #Z`).
7. **Milestones for large work:** any large feature or code change MUST have a milestone, and all related issues MUST be attached to it.
8. **Milestone deadlines:** every milestone MUST have a `due_on` date.
9. **Labels:** every issue MUST carry at least one topic label (e.g., `api`, `dx`, `security`, `infra`, `phase:N`) so the issue's domain is visible at a glance.

## Documentation

### Naming convention

All files under `docs/` MUST use ALL-CAPS filenames (`ARCHITECTURE.md`, `CONVENTIONS.md`, `DESIGN.md`). Applies to existing and future docs. Reference paths from code / CLAUDE.md / READMEs / other docs MUST match the case exactly — these paths are case-sensitive on Linux (CI) even when they appear to work on macOS.

### Doc index

| Doc | When to consult |
|-----|-----------------|
| [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) | External services, skill format, observability (PostHog) pipeline. Read before touching cross-system integration. |
| [`docs/CONVENTIONS.md`](docs/CONVENTIONS.md) | **Normative** `/api/v1/*` contract — response envelope, error format (RFC 7807), URL structure, auth, SSE, caching, OpenAPI. MUST be followed by every new endpoint. |
| [`docs/DESIGN.md`](docs/DESIGN.md) | Visual / UI design source of truth — palette, typography, spacing, motion vocabulary. Read before any UI change. |

## Design System
Always read `docs/DESIGN.md` before making any visual or UI decisions.
All font choices, colors, spacing, and aesthetic direction are defined there.
Do not deviate without explicit user approval.
In QA mode, flag any code that doesn't match `docs/DESIGN.md`.

## Skill routing

When the user's request matches an available skill, ALWAYS invoke it using the Skill
tool as your FIRST action. Do NOT answer directly, do NOT use other tools first.
The skill has specialized workflows that produce better results than ad-hoc answers.

Key routing rules:
- Product ideas, "is this worth building", brainstorming → invoke office-hours
- Bugs, errors, "why is this broken", 500 errors → invoke investigate
- Ship, deploy, push, create PR → invoke ship
- QA, test the site, find bugs → invoke qa
- Code review, check my diff → invoke review
- Update docs after shipping → invoke document-release
- Weekly retro → invoke retro
- Design system, brand → invoke design-consultation
- Visual audit, design polish → invoke design-review
- Architecture review → invoke plan-eng-review
- Save progress, checkpoint, resume → invoke checkpoint
- Code quality, health check → invoke health
