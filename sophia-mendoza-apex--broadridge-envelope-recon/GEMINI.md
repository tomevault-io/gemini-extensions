## Current State

### Final Reconciliation Numbers (audited, all sections consistent)

**Post-settlement (Mar 2022 - Dec 2025):**
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Purchased | 21,039,500 |
| Used | 18,469,949 |
| Wastage (Est., contractual max) | 690,713 |
| Adj. Variance | +1,878,838 (+8.9%) |
| Total Invoiced | $1,575,143 |
| Buffer stock | ~9.0 months (policy: 2-3 months) |

**Full period (Jan 2020 - Dec 2025):**
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Purchased | 30,065,500 |
| Used | 26,373,417 |
| Vendor Cost | $1,994,141 |
| Invoiced | $2,103,303 |

### Year-by-Year (post-settlement)
| Year | Purchased | Used | Variance | Var% |
|------|-----------|------|----------|------|
| 2022 (Mar-Dec) | 5,807,000 | 4,629,923 | +1,177,077 | +20.3% |
| 2023 | 6,571,000 | 6,081,272 | +489,728 | +7.5% |
| 2024 | 4,621,000 | 4,348,349 | +272,651 | +5.9% |
| 2025 | 4,040,500 | 3,410,405 | +630,095 | +15.6% |

### Contract Rates (verified from source PDFs)

**Original Schedule (Jan 2019 - Dec 2023):**
- Materials billed at cost + wastage (no margin)
- Wastage: 10% generic paper, 5% generic envelopes

**Amendment No. 1 (Jan 2024 - present):**
- Materials billed at inventory cost + 10% margin
- Generic inventory cost = vendor price + wastage (10% continuous, 3% cutsheet, 2% envelopes)
- Client-specific inventory cost = vendor price (no wastage)
- Generic stock: billed on usage. Client-specific stock: billed on receipt.

### Key Findings
- Usage declined 39% from 462,992/mo (2022) to 284,200/mo (2025)
- Broadridge admits 10-15% operational wastage vs 2% contract limit for envelopes
- Broadridge classifies our envelopes as **client-specific** (receipt-based billing). Our position: unbranded standard envelopes should be **generic** (usage-based).
- **Classification dispute (Mar 9):** Denci gave four shifting answers, ultimately conceding "yes they are standard envelopes" (Mar 6 PM). Sophia sent email Mar 9 pinning concession to contract language, asking to confirm generic classification.
- **Financial impact of misclassification: $225,870 (14.3%)** -- computed per-month comparing actual invoiced (receipt-based) vs generic terms (usage-based, with contractual wastage + margin). Added to Broadridge report but NOT yet cited in emails (strategic: establish principle first, bring dollars later).
- **2023 unauthorized margin: $44,218** -- 10% markup applied all of 2023 before Amendment authorized it (Jan 2024). Separate issue from classification, not yet raised.
- **CPI does not apply to materials** -- Amendment explicitly excludes materials from CPI adjustments. No CPI escalation found in envelope unit rates.
- Post-settlement spoils: 54,277 of 18,469,949 = 0.29%
- Data confidence: ~95% overall totals, ~75% per-SKU breakdown

### Product Usage & N10 Analysis (Session 21)
- **Three products drive 94% of envelope usage:** Address Verification Letters (32.3%), Monthly Statements (31.8%), Apex MTC Confirms (29.7%)
- **N10 LTR vs CON:** Only 12,000 of 12,964,000 N10 purchases (0.09%) are the single-window LTR variant. 99.9% are double-window CON.
- **Letters used CON envelopes for 4+ years:** Before the LTR variant was introduced (May 2024), all 8.5M Address Verification Letters went into double-window confirm envelopes.
- **Purchase cadence not tracking usage decline:** N10 CON ordered every ~1 month at 188K/order despite usage dropping from 300K to 200K/month. N10 running balance at +1.9M.
- **ENVCONPFSN10NI overstock:** 3.6M purchased vs 2.1M used post-settlement (+1.55M surplus, 43%). Accounts for 60% of all excess inventory.

### Internal Report Structure
1. Executive Summary (bottom line, recommendations, KPIs, gauge, wastage/billing callouts, year-by-year, 2026 projection, pre-settlement context)
2. Buffer Stock by Envelope Type (overstock callout, per-SKU table, NI/PFC context)
3. Monthly Detail (interactive, collapsed, filterable by SKU)
4. Reference (contract terms, wastage quotes, summary table, envelope specs)

### Broadridge Report Structure
1. Summary (intro + 4 KPIs + year-by-year with wastage & invoiced)
2. Items for review (wastage observation + excess inventory + classification billing impact + 4 confirmation items)
3. Purchases & usage by envelope type (4 groups + 9x12 footnote + NI/PFC context + 8 SKUs)
4. Reference (data sources + contract quotes + contract summary + Koebel quotes + pre-settlement context + generic stock classification)

## Next Steps

- [ ] **Apr 15 meeting with Denci** — walk through production data, confirm wastage on record, ask about NI variant shared stock and 9x12 PFC negative delta
- [ ] **Awaiting Terry/Fritz response** — forwarded Denci's Mar 10 reply with recommendation to switch to usage-based billing, pending their approval
- [ ] **Confirm inventory is all-location** — Denci provided 735,036 total (3/31/2026). Verify includes Edgewood, South Windsor, Coppell, etc.
- [ ] **Usage-based switch negotiation** — Denci wants to burn through 735K Apex-coded stock first (~2.3 months). Q1 2026 data shows drawdown already underway.
- [ ] **Send paper rate reply** — draft ready (Session 29): confirm 21# grade, question 2025/2026 CPI-tracking escalation, single ask = current paper vendor invoice. User attaching Feb notice + 2023 procurement screenshot.
- [ ] Raise 2023 unauthorized margin ($44,218) as separate issue from classification
- [ ] Obtain 3-5 vendor invoices (envelopes + paper) to validate Receipt Amount composition
- [ ] Request actual Jun-20 purchase report from Broadridge

## Session Log

### Latest — Session 29 (2026-07-29)

**Extracted full D17 paper rate history (Jan 2023-Mar 2026), confirmed 21# grade, redrafted reply.** Rates: $0.0094 (Jan'23) → $0.0099 (May'23) → $0.0109 (Jan'24) → $0.011215 (Jan'25) → $0.011519 (Jan'26, current). Grade = **21#** (2023 billed $0.0099 = Broadridge's own 2023 21# vendor cost). Corrected Session 28: the "$0.010900 vendor cost" was actually the 2024 *billed* rate; real cost was $0.0099. 2024 step = +10% Amendment margin (legit); 2025/2026 steps track CPI (no vendor notice until Feb 2026). Reply email drafted, single ask = current vendor invoice. Script: `extract_paper_rates.py`.
