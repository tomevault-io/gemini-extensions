# Hammunition — Claude Code Context

> Pick your RF arsenal.

## What this project is

Hammunition turns an existing Debian-family install into an amateur radio, SDR,
and RF experimentation workstation. Primary target: **Parrot OS**. Secondary:
Debian, Ubuntu, Kali, Raspberry Pi OS.

Binary: `hammunition`. Python package: `hammunition`.

## Document authority

`docs/DECISIONS.md` is authoritative. Where this file or `docs/DESIGN.md`
disagrees with it, DECISIONS wins and the disagreeing file is a bug.

- `docs/SCOPE.md` — the five-source union and 1.0 staging (**D-017**)
- `docs/PARITY-POLICY.md` — per-unit disposition and M5 exit criteria
- `docs/QUESTIONS.md` — decisions awaiting the maintainer, with recommendations
- `docs/reference/cli.md` — the CLI: verbs, flags, exit codes, what it refuses
- `docs/reference/source-build-gaps.md` — what the source backend cannot yet
  build, each gap named by the unit whose build proved it
- `docs/reference/capability-matrix.md` — every manifest against every target,
  resolution merged with a measured `apt-cache policy` sweep
- `docs/reference/parity-coverage.md` — every dispositioned unit against the
  catalog: what is covered, what is outstanding, and why each gap is open
- `docs/reference/` — the measurements everything rests on: `ahrl-inventory.md`,
  `blend-inventory.md`, `dispositions.md`, `overlaps.md`, `profile-sizing.md`,
  `licence-verification.md`, `hardware-gaps.md`, `udev-inventory.md`,
  `usb-ambiguity.md`, `lora-inventory.md`, `device-naming.md`

## What this project is NOT

Do not propose or build any of these. They have been considered and rejected:

- A Linux distribution, custom ISO, or derivative
- A custom kernel
- A mirror of upstream Debian packages
- Forks of upstream ham/SDR software
- Anything that replaces or reconfigures the user's OS wholesale

We **augment** an existing system. Upstream packages are used wherever they exist.

## Inventory sources

Two projects seed the catalog. Both are inventory sources; neither is a base we
build on. See **D-001** and **D-011** for the provenance rules, and credit both
in the README.

### Andy's Ham Radio Linux (AHRL)

AHRL by Andy Stewart (KB1OIQ) is the direct inspiration and the closest existing
thing to what we are building. Study it before designing anything. Treat it with
respect — it has served the ham community for well over a decade and its package
curation represents years of accumulated judgment we would be foolish to discard.

**What AHRL is (as of v27, May 2026):** no longer a distribution. It is an
installation script layered onto Debian Live, Raspberry Pi OS, or a supported
Ubuntu flavor. Supported and tested targets are Ubuntu/Xubuntu/Kubuntu 26.04,
Linux Mint 22.3, Debian Live 13.4, LMDE 7, and Raspberry Pi OS 6.2. Distributed
as versioned tarballs on SourceForge.

**What we take from it:**

- The package curation itself. Andy's selection of ham software — what is worth
  installing, what actually works, what is abandonware — is the single most
  valuable artifact in this space. Use the AHRL package inventory as the
  reference when seeding `catalog/packages/`.
- The layered-onto-existing-OS model. AHRL arrived at this after years as a
  distribution. That migration is strong evidence the augmentation approach is
  correct, and it is why building a distro is on our rejected list.
- Hard-won operational knowledge, e.g. Andy's guidance to prefer X11 over Wayland
  where ham applications misbehave. Capture that kind of thing in manifests and
  docs rather than rediscovering it in the field.

**What we do differently, and why the project exists:**

| AHRL | Hammunition |
|---|---|
| Tarballs on SourceForge | Git, tagged releases, signed |
| Single maintainer, bus factor of one | Multiple maintainers from day one, documented governance |
| Contribution by emailing the maintainer | Pull requests, issues, public review |
| Install logic and package list intertwined in shell | Declarative catalog separated from engine |
| Bash installation script | Python engine, idempotent, dry-run, transaction log |
| No automated cross-distro testing | CI containers per target distro |
| Ham radio only | Ham radio plus SDR, SIGINT, and RF security on a security-tooling base |

### 73Linux (KM4ACK)

73Linux, by Jason Oleham (KM4ACK), grew out of Build-a-Pi. Same shape as AHRL and
as us: an installer layered onto an existing Debian-family OS, not a distribution.
Actively maintained, 47 unique units across `app/stable/pi/` and
`app/stable/x86_64/`.

**What we take:** the inventory delta. 73Linux covers Winlink, packet, and EMCOMM
— PAT, PATMENU3, BPQ, AX.25, ARDOP, ARDOPGUI, VARA, GARIM, VARIM — a domain AHRL
does not touch at all. The packet core lands in 1.0 (**D-008**). Its community
side-loading model also informs our three-tier catalog (**D-009**).

**What we do not take:** any code. There is no LICENSE or COPYING in the
repository and no header on `73.sh`, so default copyright applies. A `.bapp` is
also executable bash with a metadata header — five easy fields declarative, every
hard field trapped inside an imperative `INSTALL()` body. That is the architecture
we exist to replace. See **D-001**.

**Positioning.** We are not competing with AHRL or 73Linux and must not present
ourselves as a replacement for either in README, docs, or commit messages. We cover a domain it does
not — RF security and SIGINT alongside amateur radio — and we solve a governance
problem rather than a software problem. Credit AHRL prominently in the README.

## Architecture invariants

Two separable halves. Do not blur them.

1. **The catalog** (`catalog/`) — YAML manifests describing software: what it is,
   what it's for, how to install it per-distro, which profiles include it.
   Pure data. No executable logic. Must remain usable by an engine that isn't ours.
2. **The engine** (`src/hammunition/`) — Python CLI that reads manifests and
   performs installation, configuration, and hardware setup.

The catalog is the durable asset; the engine is replaceable. Any change that puts
install logic into the catalog, or hardcodes package names into the engine, is wrong.

## Decisions already made

Do not re-litigate these without being asked:

| Decision | Choice | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Language | Python 3.11+ | Contributor accessibility is the point of the project |
| Package ops | `apt` via subprocess | Simpler than python3-apt, uniform across targets |
| Manifests | YAML | Human-editable by non-programmers |
| Distro detection | `/etc/os-release` | Standard, no heuristics |
| Undo semantics | Transaction log + `uninstall` | True rollback is not achievable; do not promise it |
| Config management | Own engine, Ansible as export target | Keep the catalog engine-agnostic |
| Privilege | Drop to user where possible; sudo only for apt/udev | Runs alongside offensive tooling |
| Naming | One name: Hammunition | "Renegade RF" is held in reserve, not used in docs or code |
| Architecture selector | `arch` structural from M1 | 9 AHRL units are arch-conditional; retrofitting is what broke `gspiceui` (**D-002**) |
| Profiles | Flat tags with overlap, no nesting | AHRL categories overlap but never nest; 73Linux is a flat checklist (**D-003**) |
| Catalog tiers | core / community / local | Side-loading is 73Linux's best idea and answers our founding objection to AHRL (**D-009**) |
| Update tracking | `update` block on every manifest | AHRL has no update story — install once, rot forever (**D-010**) |
| Backend selection | Measured, never conventional | We listed cargo/flatpak from habit and missed CPAN from data (**D-014**) |
| 73Linux | Inventory source, never a base | No license file; `.bapp` is bash with a header (**D-001**) |
| 1.0 scope | The five-source union | Staged by coverage-per-effort (**D-017**) |
| External claims | Tested before published | The HamClock retraction (**D-018**) |
| Blend tasks | A category, not an install default | 155 of 160 entries are `Recommends` (**D-019**) |
| Profile resolution | Consults detected hardware | 12 per-device Soapy modules; a user needs one (**D-020**) |
| Consent gates | Disclose capability, never adjudicate law | `--yes` cannot satisfy one (**D-021**) |
| Displacing a distro choice | Coexist, disclose, never remove silently | The AHRL `librtlsdr` pattern (**D-022**) |
| Device tooling | Install the means of talking to a device, never gate it on what the device can do | Otherwise every flasher is a gating argument (**D-026**) |
| Licence | GPL-3.0-or-later engine, CC0-1.0 catalog | Split on the architectural boundary (**D-023**) |
| Untagged upstreams | Pin the commit a **distribution** already packages; our own only when nothing does | Their packaging is the review signal upstream stopped providing (**D-024**) |
| Evidence | Re-verify a claim when it becomes decisive, not only when gathered | Four bugs, one shape (**D-025**) |
| Hardware claims | `status` and `maintainer_verified` are separate fields | `usrp` is supported from Debian's rule and has never been run here (**D-027**) |
| Unlicensed upstreams | Weigh community adoption and what we actually do — carry, state the position, never mirror | Most small-utility authors are not lawyers; a missing LICENSE is usually oversight (**D-033**) |
| Cellular tooling | Staged, not filtered. Receive in 1.0, transmit post-1.0, both consent-gated | The line is transmit, not topic (**D-034**) |
| Station config | A missing value defers one file, never the transaction. Nothing is invented | 19 packages refused over one unknown callsign (**D-035**) |
| udev symlinks | An identifier naming a chip may not name a `/dev` node | `/dev/badge` on a CP2102 claims the rig cable (**D-028**) |
| Desktop menus | Curated submenus, generated per DE from `categories` | GNOME folders ≠ Xfce `.menu` ≠ COSMIC; one unmeasured mechanism each (**D-036**) |
| Upstream liveness | The default branch's head commit, never GitHub's `updated_at`/`pushed_at` | `updated_at` moves when somebody *stars* a repo; it reported two dead projects as active (**D-032**) |

Full reasoning and evidence in `docs/DECISIONS.md`, which is authoritative.

## Security requirements

Non-negotiable. This runs on machines that also hold security tooling.

- Never pipe remote content into a shell
- Verify checksums/signatures for any non-apt source; refuse to install if absent
- Third-party apt repos must be declared in the manifest and shown to the user
  before being added, with the signing key pinned
- Print every system modification before making it (`--dry-run` must be complete
  and accurate, not approximate)
- RF-security tooling lives in its own profile requiring explicit opt-in
- No credentials, keys, or tokens in the repo or in generated configs

## Documentation is a first-class deliverable

Documentation is not written after the code. A feature is not done until it is
documented. This is a hard rule, not an aspiration.

**The standard:** a licensed ham with moderate Linux experience should be able to
go from a fresh Parrot install to a working digital-modes station without asking
anyone a question or reading a forum thread. If a step requires knowledge that is
not in our docs, that is a documentation bug and gets an issue.

**Required for every package manifest** — the docs generator reads these fields,
so an undocumented package cannot ship:
- What the software does, in plain language, for someone who has not used it
- Why an operator would want it, and what it is an alternative to
- What it depends on being configured first (rig control, audio routing, GPS)
- Known problems and workarounds, including desktop/display-server issues
- Upstream project URL and where to get real support for the software itself

**Required for every profile:** what it installs and why those things belong
together, disk footprint, what it deliberately excludes, and what an operator
still has to configure by hand afterward.

**Required for every system modification:** what changes, why it is necessary,
how to inspect it afterward, and how to reverse it. Groups added, udev rules
written, config files touched, repositories enabled. Nothing happens to a user's
machine that is not written down.

**Top-level docs (not part of the user-facing site):** `DECISIONS.md`
(authoritative decision record), `PARITY-POLICY.md` (per-unit disposition and M5
exit criteria), `DESIGN.md` (reasoning), `why-hammunition.md` (public rationale).

**Structure under `docs/` ("Hacker's Ham Shack").** ✅ marks what exists:
- `getting-started/` — install, first profile, first contact
- `profiles/` — one page per profile, generated from manifests plus prose
- `packages/` ✅ — generated reference, one entry per manifest.
  `scripts/gen_package_reference.py`; `tests/test_docs_generated.py` asserts
  regeneration is a no-op
- `hardware/` — per-device setup: SDRs, rigs, CAT interfaces, GPS, LoRa
- `guides/` — task-oriented: digital modes, APRS, satellite, packet, SDR
- `troubleshooting/` — symptom-first, not component-first
- `rf-security/` — separate section, legal and ethical framing required
- `contributing/` — how to add a manifest ✅, how to add a backend, review
  process; `docs/contributing/hardware.md` ✅ is the live ask
- `reference/` ✅ — CLI, capability matrix, transaction log format and the
  measured inventories. The **schema** reference is the gap here: the authority
  is `src/hammunition/manifest/schema.py`, whose fields and validators are
  documented in place

**Generate what can be generated.** The package reference and capability matrix
come from manifests, so they cannot drift from reality. Hand-written prose is for
things a schema cannot express. Any doc that duplicates manifest data by hand is
a defect.

**Docs are tested.** CI fails on broken internal links, manifests missing
required doc fields, CLI examples that no longer match actual output, and
capability-matrix claims not backed by a passing container test.

## CI and tests are not optional

**Every project here gets working CI and a real test suite, and their absence is
a defect to fix rather than a state to work around.** A maintainer preference,
recorded once and applying from here on — it does not need asking about again.

This repository already largely does this: eight CI jobs, `mypy --strict` as a
gate, container-based target tests, and a docs link checker. What follows is
the reasoning behind the rule, learned the hard way in the sibling project
[hammunition-hill](https://github.com/ChiefGyk3D/hammunition-hill), so that it
survives contact with the next repository rather than living in one person's
head.

- **Put checks in the test suite; let CI run the test suite.** A CI-only script
  rots, because nobody can run it locally and nobody notices when it stops
  meaning anything.
- **A check must be falsifiable.** Break the thing it watches on purpose and
  confirm it goes red with a message naming the fix, before trusting it. One
  check in the sibling project was silently passing on the exact input it
  existed to catch — a comment-stripping regex ate the `//` in `https://`.
- **Test the matrix, not your machine.** An ElementTree truthiness bug there
  passed on the dev venv's Python 3.11 and failed on 3.12+. It was a real bug,
  not a warning to silence.
- **A check nobody trusts is worse than none.** Two were deliberately left out
  for that reason: a formatter that would reflow 36 hand-formatted files for no
  defect caught, and whole-environment dependency auditing that would report
  advisories against the runner's own pip.
- **Prove properties, not just behaviour.** That project's test suite blocks
  every socket to anywhere but loopback, so it cannot quietly depend on the real
  internet; and it asserts the feature counts in its README against the code,
  because the README claimed twelve panels for months after there were nineteen.
- **Run it and look at it.** Three separate visual bugs there passed every test
  and were found by rendering the page.
- **Measure before claiming.** An importer's first version needed ~620 MB of RAM
  at real scale, more than a Pi Zero has, while its docstring claimed the
  opposite.
- **Never pin an action from memory; resolve it.** Every pin in that project's
  first workflow was a real commit and two major versions stale, and one failed
  outright against the runner's newer CLI. `git ls-remote --tags` is the check.
  Worth a look here too: this repository's `actions/checkout@v4` is three majors
  behind current.

## Conventions

- Idempotent: every operation safe to re-run
- Fail loudly, never silently degrade
- Structured logging to `~/.local/state/hammunition/`
- Type hints throughout; `mypy --strict` clean
- Tests run in containers per target distro, never against the dev machine.
  `containers/targets.yaml` declares them; `scripts/run-targets.sh` runs them
  locally with **rootless Podman** and **fails loudly** if the runtime is
  unusable rather than skipping. Never join the `docker` group to work around
  it — group membership is root-equivalent host access, which is the trade this
  project declined (Q-001).
- An account with no `/etc/subuid` ranges can set
  `HAMMUNITION_DEGRADED_PODMAN=1`, which applies the two workarounds
  (`APT_SANDBOX_USER=root`, `ignore_chown_errors`) and **prints a warning that
  isolation is weakened**. Opt-in, never a silent default; CI needs neither. The
  real fix is one root command, printed by the script.
- `mypy --strict` is wired into CI as a gate (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`).
  CI pins Python 3.11+; a dev machine may be older, and CI is the authority.
- `scripts/check_doc_links.py` validates markdown links **and backticked repo
  paths** — this project's prose cites files by backtick, so a markdown-only
  checker would validate almost nothing.
- Generated docs are generated: `scripts/gen_blend_inventory.py` rebuilds the
  Blend inventory from upstream task files. Never hand-edit a generated file.
- **Two files under `catalog/` are generated too**, and being generated does not
  breach the "pure data, no executable logic" invariant — a generated YAML file
  is data exactly as a typed one is. `catalog/hardware/ambiguous-ids.yaml` comes
  from `gen_usb_ambiguity.py`; `catalog/hardware/classes/programmer.yaml` comes
  from `gen_programmer_class.py`, because five packages name **180 distinct
  identifiers** between them and transcribing 180 evidence strings by hand is a
  long opportunity to make the mistakes this project keeps writing checks for.
  Run `gen_usb_ambiguity.py` first: the class reads its output. A test asserts
  regeneration is a no-op.
- **Upstream project metadata is mined the same way.** Meshtastic and MeshCore
  publish a PlatformIO board file per product naming its USB identifiers;
  `scripts/lora-sweep.sh` reads them. 107 boards, 26 identifiers, the top one
  covering 49 — which is how the `meshtastic` entry was closed without any
  hardware, and had to be, since the maintainer's nodes were lost to flooding.
- **Distribution udev rules are a primary source and are mined, not guessed.**
  `scripts/run-udev-sweep.sh` reads every package in the archive that ships one
  — no curated shortlist, because a curated shortlist is how `rtl-sdr` came to
  carry 3 identifiers where Debian carries 42. A sweep produces *candidates*:
  generic bridge identifiers like `0403:6001` and `0483:df11` appear in rules
  for devices they do not identify, and carrying those over-matches as silently
  as omission under-matches. See `docs/reference/udev-inventory.md`.
- **A citation of a distribution's udev rule is checked against that rule.**
  `scripts/check_rule_citations.py` verifies every identifier in
  `catalog/hardware/` against the archive sweep — the file it cites really
  contains the pair, a "disabled by Debian" claim really is a commented-out rule
  *with a stated reason*, and `basis: distribution_disabled` is true of the
  archive. Written because reading a sweep row and not opening the file produced
  a wrong claim in D-028 one commit after D-031 was recorded.
- **Verify the effect, not the exit status** (**D-031**). A tool reporting
  success is not evidence it did anything: `sed` exits 0 on an anchor that
  matched nothing, `dpkg-deb -x` writes files and *then* exits non-zero, and a
  `.gitignore` match makes a written file simply absent with no error anywhere.
  Check the artefact. `scripts/check_commit_claims.py` enforces the commit-message
  half — enable it with `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`; CI runs it over
  every commit in a pull request either way.
- Small, logically scoped commits
- **Git workflow (WIP phase, 2026-08-25):** commit and **push directly to `main`**
  after each completed item. Once there is a solid working version, switch to
  feature branches and PRs. We are a long way from that; until then, main is the
  working branch and pushing is expected rather than gated.
- **Every `.gitignore` pattern is anchored to the repo root unless it has a
  recorded reason not to be.** `scripts/audit_gitignore.py` enforces both halves:
  nothing in the source tree may be ignored, and an unanchored pattern must be
  listed by name with why it must match at any depth. Three silent exclusions
  came from the same mistake — a trailing slash reads as anchored and anchors
  nothing. CI runs it.
- `/reference/` and `/vendor/` are gitignored, **anchored to the repo root**:
  third-party tarballs and extracted upstream trees are studied locally, never
  committed. Keep provenance clean. The anchoring matters — the unanchored form
  also matches `docs/reference/`, a required documentation section, and silently
  excluded it. A test asserts `docs/reference/` stays tracked.

## Capability matrix

Not every profile works everywhere. Manifests declare per-distro support and the
engine reports honest gaps rather than faking coverage. Never add a shim to make
an unsupported combination appear to work.

`docs/reference/capability-matrix.md` is generated and is the record.
**Resolution alone overstates coverage**, which is why it merges two things.
Most manifests carry one *unconditional* apt block deliberately — apt reports
the truth at plan time, where a `when:` selector would freeze one evening's
measurement and be wrong the day a distribution picks the package up — so
`scripts/capability_matrix.py`, which answers "does a manifest resolve to a
block", says `apt` for every target including the four where `sdrangel` does
not exist. `scripts/gen_capability_matrix.py` merges that resolution with a
measured `apt-cache policy` sweep and distinguishes `apt` from `apt ✗`.

It remains the **weaker** of the two checks: policy proves the archive offers a
package, not that it installs. `install-verification.md` is the stronger one and
covers a subset. Build rows are weaker still — they say a build is *declared*,
not that it succeeds; the manifests whose builds have actually been run say so
in their own install notes.

Ticks mark what exists. **M1's walking skeleton runs** — detect, resolve, print,
install, log — and **M3 has begun**: the verified fetcher and the
source-from-tarball and source-from-git backends are written, so `source` and
`git` manifests now plan and build end to end. What it cannot do it still refuses by name: three backends
(binary, venv, pipx), third-party apt repos, templated config files and
udev generation are measured, named and absent. Do not let this read as a
working installer: **57 of AHRL's 95 units cannot be satisfied by apt**, and
while source-from-tarball is the largest single slice of that 57 (35 units), the
rest of the 60% is still the hard part (**D-004**).

## Closed questions

Both former open questions are settled. Do not reopen without new evidence.

- **Profile nesting** — closed by **D-003**. Profiles are flat tags with overlap;
  they do not nest or depend on each other. AHRL's categories overlap heavily
  (14 programs appear in two or three) but never nest; 73Linux uses a flat
  checklist. These are tags, not a tree. `categories` is a list.
- **ARM as a day-one target** — closed by **D-002**. Yes. `arch` is a structural
  selector in the schema from M1, not a retrofit. Nine AHRL units are
  arch-conditional and 73Linux ships arch-partitioned trees. The cost of
  retrofitting is visible in AHRL's `install_gspiceui`, which hardcodes an
  `aarch64-linux-gnu` path on every architecture.

**Still open and now blocking:** station-local configuration (callsign, grid
square, rig device paths). The 1.0 packet core forces it — AX.25's install writes
`wl2k ${MYCALL} 1200 255 7 Winlink` into `/etc/ax25/axports`, and
`catalog/packages/linbpq.yaml` is the first manifest in the repository to carry a
`config_files` block, templating `NODECALL`, `NODEALIAS` and `LOCATOR`. It is no
longer a design question in the abstract; a shipped manifest depends on it. See
`DESIGN.md` §15.3 and the D-004 amendment.

**Open questions awaiting the maintainer** are in `docs/QUESTIONS.md`.
**Q-001 through Q-014 are all resolved.** Q-006, Q-007 and Q-008 closed on
2026-08-29: HamClock carries both clients defaulting to `openhamclock` with
`ohb.works` as the backend; SuperSDR is carried under **D-033**; cellular
tooling is staged under **D-034**.

There are no open questions blocking work. The next decisions that will need
you are the ones this round's work raises, not ones already on the list.

## Roadmap — 1.0 is the five-source union

Parity is **not** "reproduce AHRL." Per `docs/PARITY-POLICY.md`, the goal is that
a user who uninstalls AHRL and installs Hammunition is **strictly better off**:
everything that worked still works, some things work that didn't, some are better
than what they replace, and the dead weight is gone *with an explanation*.
Reproducing AHRL faithfully — broken and obsolete entries included — would be a
worse product than AHRL.

Every unit gets exactly one disposition: **CARRY, SUPERSEDE, REVIVE, RETIRE, or
ADD**. No unit is left unclassified. Never inherit a `broken` verdict without
testing it ourselves.

**1.0 = Debian Blend + AHRL parity + 73Linux packet core + Skywave listening
delta + DragonOS Tier 1** (**D-017**; `docs/SCOPE.md` governs). Staged by
coverage-per-effort, not by source:

1. **Debian Blend** — 152 packages, team-governed, signed, machine-readable.
   Cheapest coverage and best provenance. **11 of AHRL's 35 source builds are
   already packaged here**, so Blend-first shrinks the source-backend problem
   rather than merely deferring it. See `docs/reference/blend-inventory.md`.
2. **AHRL parity** — per `PARITY-POLICY.md`, with honest status.
3. **73Linux packet core** — PAT, AX.25, BPQ, ARDOP, QtTermTCP, QtSoundModem,
   Pi-APRS, and Direwolf *with configuration* (**D-008**).
4. **Skywave listening delta** — remote SDR clients, utility decoders. Cheap, and
   an on-ramp for users who own no hardware yet.
5. **DragonOS Tier 1** — apt or upstream `.deb` only. This is the 1.0 SIGINT
   profile.

**DragonOS is tiered and the tiers are not one job.** Tier 2 (maintained upstream
binaries) is post-1.0. **Tier 3 — GNU Radio out-of-tree modules — must not be
attempted before the source backend and pin database are solid.** Each module
records the GNU Radio version it was built against; where nothing maintained
exists, document the gap rather than carry a fork we cannot sustain.

VARA and HAMRS are post-1.0. Novel capability (RF security, mesh) layers on top,
never substitutes.

**M1 — walking skeleton. ✅ It runs.** `hammunition install <profile> --dry-run`
resolves the whole transaction and prints every command; without `--dry-run` it
installs. Remaining M1 gap is the starter profile's name and contents, which
`docs/reference/profile-sizing.md` still has awaiting the maintainer.
- Manifest schema + validator ✅
- apt backend ✅ — with real resolution: `depends` goes through
  `apt-cache policy`, which is what D-016's four suspected-stale AHRL
  dependency lines needed and never got. Source and git backends followed
  in M3; see below
- `/etc/os-release` detection ✅ — shared with `scripts/capability_matrix.py`
  rather than duplicated, so `--check` verifies the parser the engine uses
- the starter profile is the last M1 item and is **awaiting the maintainer**:
  named `ham-core` when M1 was written, `docs/reference/profile-sizing.md`
  proposes **`station`** instead and a four-way split. The catalog it would
  draw on is no longer the constraint — 222 manifests exist where M1 planned
  about twenty
- `install`, `list`, `status`, `show`, `--dry-run` ✅
- Container test harness for Parrot and Debian ✅

**M2 — inventory and coverage. ✅ All five sources are now measured.** Every
inventory is generated from upstream data and regenerable; none is hand-typed.

| Source | Document | Headline |
|---|---|---|
| AHRL | `docs/reference/ahrl-inventory.md` | 95 executing units; **57 not apt-installable** |
| Debian Blend | `docs/reference/blend-inventory.md` | 12 tasks, 152 packages; **8 not installable on Debian 13** (**D-019**) |
| 73Linux | `docs/reference/dispositions.md` | 28 delta units; 13 survive |
| Skywave | `docs/reference/skywave-inventory.md` | 60 apps; **9 delta**, all absent from Debian stable *and* unstable |
| DragonOS | `docs/reference/dragonos-tier1-inventory.md` | 99 README units; **24 Tier 1**, probed in all four targets |

Dispositions are complete for **all five sources**
(`docs/reference/dispositions.md`): 150 units, none unclassified — AHRL,
73Linux, the Skywave delta (9: 7 ADD, 1 SUPERSEDE, 1 NEEDS-DECISION), and
DragonOS Tier 1 (8 new ADD, 16 CARRY by cross-reference). Sizing and naming
are in `docs/reference/profile-sizing.md`.

**M3 — backend completeness.** Backends are justified by measurement, never by
convention (**D-014**). Every backend names the unit requiring it.

Measured from the inventory: **57 of 95 AHRL units cannot be satisfied by apt** —
35 source builds from bundled tarballs, 9 prebuilt binaries and data archives,
4 Python venv/pipx, 2 Python-run-in-place, 3 infrastructure, 2 launcher-only,
1 network git clone, 1 remote script piped into bash. An apt-only tool covers
40% of the parity target, and the missing 60% is precisely what users cannot
install themselves — the reason this project exists (**D-004**).

Required for 1.0: apt ✅, source-from-tarball ✅, source-from-git ✅,
binary ✅ (`.deb`, tarball, zip, single executable — **AppImage refused by
name**, post-1.0 per SCOPE.md), Python venv ✅ (hash-pinned, 2026-08-30), and
launcher generation ✅ (engine written same day; the 14 units migrate as
their other gaps close, and **D-036**'s per-DE submenu layer is still to
measure). **pipx and
CPAN left the list on 2026-08-30** — re-measured at zero users after chirp
went apt and aa-analyzer's supersede; see the D-014 amendment.

The binary backend was written for the largest single group of blocked units.
Two of them turned out not to need it: **QtTermTCP and QtSoundModem tag source
on GitHub**, so they are ordinary pinned qmake builds, and only 73Linux's habit
of fetching unversioned executables from a directory called `Beta` made them
look like binary units. What remains for it is Pi-APRS, GARIM, ARDOPGUI,
AntScope2, GridTracker2 and `sdrangel` on the five targets that do not package
it. **A
`.deb` goes through `apt-get install ./file.deb`, never `dpkg -i`** — apt
resolves the dependencies where dpkg installs the package and leaves them
broken.

**Build systems are measured too.** The source backend implements `cmake` (11),
`autotools` (10), `make` (7), `qmake` (4) and `qmake6` (1) — counted across the
catalog's 33 `source` and `git` blocks. `qmake6` is separate from `qmake`
because Debian 13 with only `qt6-base-dev` has no `/usr/bin/qmake` at all.

`custom` and `patches` remain **measured zeros in the catalog** and are refused
by name. `patches` is no longer a speculative zero, though: `linrad` needs one
and cannot be shipped without it, because its Makefile bakes `-Werror` into a
literal flag string with no variable to override.
`docs/reference/source-build-gaps.md` names that and five other gaps, each
against the unit whose build proved it.

Measured zeros — recorded, not deleted, so they are not re-added by convention:
`cargo` 0, `flatpak` 0, `appimage` 0 in AHRL. AppImage and a configured Wine
prefix are **post-1.0**, required by HAMRS and VARA respectively. `snap` appears
11 times and is an **anti-dependency** — every occurrence is removal — so it
belongs in `system_modifications`, never as a backend.

**M4 — profiles and hardware.** Full profile set. udev rules, group membership,
firmware. Persistent device symlinks.

**M5 — parity verified.** Every unit either **installs successfully on at least
one supported distro**, or carries a `broken`/`retired` status **verified by us**
— never inherited from an AHRL shell comment. Re-attempt `ardop`,
`radiosonde_auto_rx`, and the compiler-flag-fragile set before accepting any
verdict, and record what was tested: date, version, distro, actual failure.

**Exit criterion: our install-success fraction must be at least as good as
AHRL's own.** AHRL ships 95 units with 9 disabled. Shipping 95 manifests with 40
marked broken is not parity, however complete the coverage looks. Inherited
verdicts count against us; tested-and-confirmed-dead does not. The M5 report
shows disposition, evidence, and whether each verdict was tested or inherited.

**Post-1.0 — the extension.** SIGINT and RF-security profiles, Meshtastic/LoRa,
the Parrot-specific integration. This is where Hammunition stops being "AHRL
done properly" and becomes its own thing.

**Definition of "more modern and robust":** declarative over imperative,
git over tarballs, tested over hoped-for, multi-maintainer over solo,
idempotent over run-once, dry-run over surprise, measured coverage over
assumed coverage.

## Hardware context

The maintainer's own gear drives priority for the hardware role. **Owned and
testable** distinguishes what can close an `identification_gap` here from what
cannot — see `docs/reference/hardware-gaps.md`, which is generated and
authoritative:

- **Owned:** HackRF Pro, CatSniffer V3, Electronic Cats Minino, Free-WiLi 2,
  nRF52840, Proxmark3 v3 and v5, Clip-Boy, C5 Wardriver v1.1 (unflashed), EFF Rayhunter, ClockworkPi uConsole with Hacker Gadgets AIO v2,
  Meshtastic devices (T-Deck, T-Echo, RAK/WisMesh), Yaesu FT-991A, BTECH
  UV-50PRO, Panasonic Toughbook FZ-55.
- **Planned, not owned:** PortaPack H4M, Proxmark3 RDV4. Catalogued, never
  marked maintainer-verified.
- **Not owned:** LimeSDR, PlutoSDR, KrakenSDR, SDRplay RSP. Carried because
  other operators have them; their gaps say *not owned* rather than *pending*,
  because the reason a gap is open is as important as the fact that it is.

**The hardware role is permissions, composite-device mapping, firmware-mode
identification, and honest documentation of what nothing solves** (**D-029**).
Persistent udev symlinks are one tactic used where the evidence supports one,
not the headline — this file previously called them "the highest-value feature",
and the generated accounting in `docs/reference/device-naming.md` does not
support that. systemd's `60-serial.rules` already gives every USB-*serial*
device a stable `/dev/serial/by-id/` path. It gives nothing to the 12 of 21
catalogued devices that are libusb, nothing to a Proxmark3 that supplies no
serial for it to compose a path from, nothing to permissions, and no label to
any of the Free-WiLi 2's four ports. That is the work.
