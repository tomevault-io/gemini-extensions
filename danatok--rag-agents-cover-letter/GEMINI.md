# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

Always read `plan.md` at session start to know current phase and next step — it's the living
record of progress across sessions, so check it before assuming what's done vs. still open.

## Commands

Run all commands from this directory (`rag_agents_cover_letter/`) — `pytest.ini` sets `pythonpath = .` so `src` resolves as a package from here.

```bash
# Activate the existing venv (or create one: python -m venv .venv)
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run all tests
pytest

# Run a single test
pytest tests/test_ingest.py::test_load_pdf_documents_reads_pdf_with_cover_letter_metadata -v

# Run one test file
pytest tests/test_retrieve.py -v

# Full ingest pipeline (real OpenAI calls: gpt-4o-mini metadata extraction per PDF + embeddings — costs money, requires OPENAI_API_KEY in .env)
python -m src.ingest

# CLI query against the persisted vector store
python -m src.retrieve "some query"

# Wipe the vector store to force a clean re-ingest
rm -rf chroma_db

# Run the eval harness (real gpt-4o-mini calls: full agent graph + 2 judge calls per example — costs money, appends to eval/results.csv)
python -m eval.run_eval
```

Notebook (`notebooks/explore.ipynb`) outputs are stripped via `nbstripout` (declared in `.gitattributes`). After cloning, run once: `pip install nbstripout && nbstripout --install`.

## Architecture

Three-stage pipeline, one module each, composed either manually or via the `agent/` LangGraph graph below:

**`src/ingest.py`** — load → chunk → embed → persist.
- PDFs live under `data/cover letters/`, `data/projects/`, `data/cv/`; each directory has a thin wrapper (`load_pdf_documents`, `load_project_documents`, `load_cv_documents`) around the shared `_load_pdf_documents_from(directory)`.
- For every PDF, `extract_metadata_llm(text, source)` calls `gpt-4o-mini` in JSON mode to derive `type` (`cv`/`project`/`cover_letter`), `company`, and `skills` (comma-separated tools only). This dict becomes the `Document.metadata`, which `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter.split_documents()` then propagates onto every chunk — so metadata is per-source-document, not per-chunk-derived.
- `ingest()` chunks with `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` (300/50, paragraph → line → sentence separators), embeds with `OpenAIEmbeddings(text-embedding-3-small)`, and persists to a Chroma collection (`cv_documents`) at `chroma_db/`. It calls `.delete_collection()` first — re-running `ingest()` replaces the collection rather than appending duplicate chunks.
- `load_documents()`, `chunk_documents()`, and `infer_type()` are a legacy token-count-based path over `data/*.txt` with filename-keyword type inference. They're no longer wired into `ingest()` (see the commented-out line) but are still covered by tests — don't assume they're dead code without checking call sites first.

**`src/retrieve.py`** — query the persisted collection.
- `get_retriever(k, doc_type=None)` builds a Chroma similarity retriever; passing `doc_type` adds a metadata `filter={"type": doc_type}`.
- `retrieve(query, k)` is unfiltered top-k; `retrieve_by_type(query, doc_type, k)` filters by the `type` field. There is no equivalent filter for `company` yet, and any chunks embedded before `extract_metadata_llm` existed won't have a `company` field at all.

**`src/generator.py`** — `generate(context, job_description, gap_analysis="", company_research="")` sends retrieved context + a job description + any known gaps + company research through a fixed prompt to `gpt-4o-mini` (temperature 0.3) and returns one cover-letter paragraph. The prompt explicitly forbids inventing facts not present in the supplied context, instructs the model to address noted gaps honestly (leaning on adjacent experience) rather than ignore or overclaim them, and to use company research naturally rather than forcing it in. Both extra params default to `""`, which become `"None noted."`/`"None."` in the prompt respectively.

**`agent/`** — LangGraph agent composing the pipeline above into a graph (`plan.md` Phase 2, now complete).
- `agent/state.py` defines `AgentState` (TypedDict): `job_description` + optional `company` in, `retrieved_chunks`/`company_research`/`gap_analysis`/`cover_letter` populated by the graph below.
- `agent/nodes/retrieve.py` and `agent/nodes/generate.py` wrap `src.retrieve.retrieve`/`src.generator.generate` directly — no logic duplicated. `agent/nodes/gap_analysis.py` mirrors `src/generator.py`'s own `ChatPromptTemplate` + `ChatOpenAI` shape (`temperature=0`, factual comparison) to flag what's missing between retrieved chunks and the job description. `agent/nodes/company_research.py` wraps a module-level `TavilyClient()` (reads `TAVILY_API_KEY` from env — eager construction, no guard, same convention as `ingest.py`'s `_openai_client`) and calls `.search(..., include_answer=True)`.
- `agent/graph.py` wires `START → retrieve → (company_research?) → gap_analysis → generate → END` via `StateGraph(AgentState)`. The `retrieve → company_research` edge is a real **conditional edge** (`add_conditional_edges`, routing function `_route_after_retrieve`): `company_research_node` only runs when `state["company"]` is truthy, otherwise the graph skips straight to `gap_analysis` — the first actual decision-based routing in the graph, as opposed to the fixed line it started as. Run directly with `python -m agent.graph "some job description"` (CLI only sets `job_description`, so it always takes the skip branch; invoke `build_graph().invoke({...})` directly with a `company` key to exercise the Tavily path).

**`eval/`** — LLM-as-judge evaluation, deliberately built *without* the `ragas` library (`plan.md` Phase 3). Every `ragas` version from 0.2.0 through 0.4.3 hard-imports `langchain_community.chat_models.vertexai`, a module removed from `langchain-community` before the version this repo already depends on (`0.4.2`) — confirmed structural incompatibility, not a pinning issue. `eval/metrics.py` implements `score_faithfulness`/`score_answer_relevancy` as direct `gpt-4o-mini` JSON-mode judge calls, mirroring `ingest.extract_metadata_llm`'s pattern exactly. `eval/dataset.py` is ~6 hand-authored job description snippets (no real postings are stored anywhere in the repo). `eval/run_eval.py` runs the real `agent.graph` per example, scores the result, prints and appends to `eval/results.csv` (intentionally not gitignored — a running score history you can diff across commits as chunking/retrieval/prompts change). Costs real API calls; not part of `pytest`.

## Testing convention

Every test mocks the OpenAI/Chroma/Tavily boundary (`@patch("src.retrieve.Chroma")`, `@patch("src.generator.ChatOpenAI")`, `@patch("agent.nodes.company_research._tavily_client")`, `@patch("eval.metrics._openai_client")`, monkeypatching `ingest.extract_metadata_llm`, etc.) — no test should make a real network call. `tests/test_ingest.py::make_pdf_bytes` builds a minimal single-page PDF in memory byte-by-byte so PDF-loading tests don't need binary fixture files on disk. `tests/test_agent_graph.py` additionally asserts the mocked Tavily client is *never* called when `company` is absent, to prove the conditional edge actually skips the node rather than just calling it with empty input. Note: `eval/`'s metric *functions* are unit-tested this way, but `eval/run_eval.py` itself (which drives the real graph + real API calls across the dataset) is intentionally outside this convention, same as `src.ingest`/`agent.graph`.

## Roadmap

`plan.md` at the repo root is the living master plan (current phase, active node, parking-lot items) — check it before starting work to see what's actually in progress versus already decided against. As of this writing Phase 2 (agentic LangGraph layer: basic graph, gap analysis, Tavily company research) is complete; Phase 3 (evaluation) has a custom eval harness done, with real `ragas` adoption blocked (see `eval/` above) and context-precision/recall + gap-analysis-accuracy metrics still open. Note `TAVILY_API_KEY` isn't in `.env` yet, so `company_research_node` has only been verified against mocks, not the real Tavily API.

`README.md`'s "Improvements" section lists known-but-unimplemented ideas: CV-aware chunking (respecting project/role/skill boundaries instead of raw character counts), hybrid semantic+BM25 search, and reranking top-k before generation.
