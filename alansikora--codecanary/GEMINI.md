## Binary

- **`codecanary`** — single binary for reviews, setup, and credential management. Installed locally via `install.sh`, also used by the GitHub Action.

## Build

```sh
go build ./cmd/review    # builds codecanary
```

Version is set via ldflags: `-X main.version=v{version}`

## Lint

```sh
golangci-lint run ./...
```

All code must pass `golangci-lint` with default linters (errcheck, staticcheck, etc.). Run this before committing.

## Key dependencies

- `spf13/cobra` — CLI framework
- `charmbracelet/huh` — terminal form builder (setup wizard)
- `zalando/go-keyring` — OS keychain (with file-based fallback for systems without one)
- `bmatcuk/doublestar` — glob pattern matching for ignore rules
- `gopkg.in/yaml.v3` — config parsing
- `golang.org/x/term` — terminal detection

## Architecture

### Core principle: adapters keep the engine agnostic

The review engine (`runner.go`) is provider- and platform-agnostic. It depends only on two interfaces — never on concrete GitHub APIs, LLM SDKs, or environment-specific logic. All environment and provider specifics live behind adapters.

### Provider layer — `ModelProvider` interface (`provider.go`)

Abstracts LLM invocations. The core engine calls `provider.Run(ctx, prompt, opts)` and gets back text + usage metadata. It never knows which LLM backend is being used.

**Implementations**: `anthropic`, `openai`, `openrouter`, `claude` (CLI).
**Selection**: factory registry in `provider.go` — `NewProviderForRole(mc, env)` returns the right implementation based on `mc.Provider`.

Adding a new LLM provider means: create `provider_<name>.go` and register a `ProviderFactory` (constructor, validation, pricing, default models) via `init()`.

### Platform layer — `ReviewPlatform` interface (`platform.go`)

Abstracts environment-specific operations: loading previous findings, publishing results, saving state, resolving threads, reporting usage.

**Implementations**: `GithubPlatform` (posts to PRs, reads threads via API), `LocalPlatform` (prints to terminal, persists state to `~/.codecanary/repos/<owner>/<repo>/state/<branch>.json` — per-repo scoping keeps branch names like `main` from colliding across repos; falls back to `~/.codecanary/state/<branch>.json` when no git remote is resolvable).

Routing is strict: `codecanary review --post` → `GithubPlatform`; `codecanary review` (no `--post`) → `LocalPlatform`, even when the branch has an open PR. Local is local — the branch diff (with uncommitted changes) is reviewed against the default base, previous findings come from local state, nothing is fetched from or posted to GitHub. The old `GithubPlatform`-with-`Post=false` hybrid is gone; it was the source of the "state written locally, read from GitHub" asymmetry that kept breaking incremental local reviews.

Adding a new platform (e.g., GitLab) means: implement `ReviewPlatform`, wire it in the CLI.

### Unified review pipeline (`runner.go`)

There is a **single `Run()` function** — not separate paths for GitHub vs. local. The pipeline is:

1. Fetch PR data (or local diff)
2. Load config, project docs, file contents
3. Create providers via `NewProviderForRole()` (factory, provider-agnostic)
4. Load previous findings via `platform.LoadPreviousFindings()`
5. If incremental: triage threads, evaluate via provider, handle resolutions
6. Build and execute main review prompt
7. Parse findings, filter non-actionable
8. `platform.Publish()` → `platform.SaveState()` → `platform.ReportUsage()`

### Other architecture notes

- **Config** is split across two files in `.codecanary/`: `config.yml` (provider, models, budgets, timeouts) and `review.yml` (rules, context, ignore patterns). `review.yml` is optional — if present, its fields override rules/context/ignore in `config.yml`. A personal `review.local.yml` can add rules, context, and ignore patterns on top of `review.yml` (append semantics, not replacement). Legacy `.codecanary.yml` at repo root is still supported with a deprecation warning.
- **Incremental reviews**: on re-push, triage existing threads (Go-driven classifier in `triage.go`), evaluate changed threads via provider (triage model), then review only new code
- **Dual marker detection**: reads both `codecanary:review` and legacy `clanopy:review` HTML markers for backward compatibility
- **Anti-hallucination**: explicit file allowlist, line validation against diff, max finding distance threshold
- **OIDC worker** (`oidc/worker/`): OIDC token exchange proxy at `oidc.codecanary.sh` — verifies GitHub Actions OIDC token, returns GitHub App installation token
- **Telemetry worker** (`telemetry/worker/`): anonymous usage ingest at `telemetry.codecanary.sh` — writes to a Cloudflare Analytics Engine dataset
- **Telemetry dashboard** (`telemetry/dashboard/`): internal analytics view at `dashboard.codecanary.sh` — Cloudflare Pages + Pages Functions, gated by Cloudflare Access. Reads the AE dataset via the SQL HTTP API with a read-only API token (no AE binding, so writes are platform-impossible)
- **Setup** is a subcommand (`codecanary setup`) using `charmbracelet/huh` forms, with `local` and `github` sub-flows
- **Credentials** use a single env var `CODECANARY_PROVIDER_SECRET` for all providers. Stored via `go-keyring` (OS keychain) with a file-based fallback (`~/.codecanary/credentials.json`, mode `0600`). `resolveEnv()` in `runner.go` injects the stored credential into the filtered env when not already set.

## Rules

- **Keep the core engine agnostic.** `runner.go`, `triage.go`, `prompt.go`, `findings.go` must never import or reference a specific LLM provider or platform. All provider/platform specifics go behind the `ModelProvider` or `ReviewPlatform` interfaces. No `if provider == "openai"` in core logic.
- **Use the adapter/provider pattern for new integrations.** New LLM backends → create `provider_<name>.go` with a `ProviderFactory` registration in `init()`. New deployment targets → implement `ReviewPlatform` + wire in CLI. Never fork the pipeline.
- **One pipeline, not two.** There must be a single `Run()` path. GitHub and local modes differ only in which `ReviewPlatform` implementation is injected — the orchestration logic is shared.
- **Shared types for similar providers.** OpenAI-compatible APIs share request/response types via `provider_compat.go`. Don't duplicate HTTP client logic across providers.
- **Don't repeat yourself.** Before writing new code, search the codebase for existing functions, mappings, or logic that already does what you need — then call it instead of reimplementing it. This applies to everything: switch statements, helper functions, validation logic, data mappings, HTTP calls. One source of truth, callers import it. Don't merge scaffolding or unused exports — if it's not called yet, it doesn't ship yet.
- **File names are ownership boundaries.** A function defined in `local.go` implies it belongs to the local flow; one in `github.go` implies it belongs to GitHub. If a function is called by multiple files in the same package, it belongs in a shared file (e.g., `forms.go` for setup helpers, `platform.go` for platform-shared logic). Never define shared infrastructure in a flow-specific file — move it to the file that matches its actual scope.
- **Canonical provider registration points.** Provider names live in the factory map in `provider.go`. All providers use `CODECANARY_PROVIDER_SECRET` for credentials (defined in `internal/credentials/keyring.go`). When adding a new provider, register a `ProviderFactory` in `provider.go` and add config validation in `config.go`.
- **Minimize shell code.** `install.sh` and the GitHub Action (`action.yml`) should be kept as thin as possible. All logic must live in Go.
- **Workflow template is embedded.** `internal/setup/codecanary.yml` is the single source of truth for the GitHub Actions workflow, embedded via `//go:embed`. `.github/workflows/codecanary.yml` must be identical — `go test ./internal/setup/` enforces this. When changing the workflow, edit either file and copy to the other.
- **Claude skills are embedded.** `internal/skills/codecanary-fix/SKILL.md` is the single source of truth for the codecanary-fix skill, embedded via `//go:embed` and materialized by `codecanary install-skill`. `.claude/skills/codecanary-fix/SKILL.md` must be identical so Claude Code's project-mode discovery finds it when working in this repo — `go test ./internal/skills/` enforces this. When changing the skill, edit either file and copy to the other.
- **Keep `docs/review-flow.md` in sync.** This document describes the full review pipeline — every step, the triage flow, platform differences, and key design decisions. When changing `runner.go`, `triage.go`, `prompt.go`, `findings.go`, `github.go`, `local.go`, `platform.go`, or the `ReviewPlatform` implementations, update the doc to reflect the new behavior.
- Tests exist for config, findings, formatting, and triage. Be careful with refactors — run `go test ./...` and `go vet ./...`.
