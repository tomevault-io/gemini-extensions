# Codex Rules For ChangShuoRadioData

## 1. Mission

This repository is a MATLAB-based spectrum sensing simulation system. Its job is
to generate physically and communicationally consistent synthetic data for
multi-scene radio monitoring, spectrum occupancy analysis, and downstream model
training or evaluation.

Every code change must preserve one core property:

- The generated signal, the scene state, and the annotation must describe the
  same underlying event.

Correctness is more important than speed, convenience, or local elegance.

## 2. Project Shape

Treat the main pipeline as:

1. `SimulationRunner`
2. `ChangShuo`
3. `ScenarioFactory`
4. physical environment simulation
5. communication behavior simulation
6. waveform generation and transmitter processing
7. channel propagation
8. receiver processing
9. annotation export

Do not change a downstream block without checking the contracts from the
upstream block that feeds it and the downstream block that consumes it.

## 3. Scope Discipline

- Read only the code and configuration needed for the task.
- Do not bulk-read unrelated data folders, generated outputs, or map assets.
- Do not rewrite raw datasets, OSM assets, or generated samples unless the task
  explicitly asks for it.
- Keep edits tightly scoped. Avoid opportunistic refactors in unrelated modules.

## 4. Non-Negotiable Simulation Invariants

### 4.1 Time-frequency consistency

- Occupancy annotations must match the actual emitted signal in time.
- Center frequency, bandwidth, sample rate, frame duration, and modulation
  parameters must stay numerically consistent across the pipeline.
- Never silently reinterpret units. If a field changes unit, rename it or add a
  clear conversion step.

### 4.2 Spatial consistency

- Never mix geographic coordinates and Cartesian coordinates silently.
- Latitude and longitude are not meters. Velocity in meters per second must not
  be combined with degree deltas without explicit conversion.
- Antenna height, distance, relative velocity, and map geometry must be handled
  in a physically meaningful way.

### 4.3 Power and channel consistency

- Do not introduce or remove attenuation, gain, or noise terms without tracing
  their effect on received power and annotation fields.
- Channel model selection must be explicit. Do not rely on field order or other
  implicit selection behavior.
- Different Tx-Rx links must not accidentally share mutable channel state unless
  that sharing is physically intended and clearly documented.

### 4.4 Annotation consistency

- If the simulator falls back from one physical model to another, the fallback
  must be visible in metadata or annotations.
- Never claim a physically richer model was used when the code actually used a
  simpler fallback.
- If a value is estimated rather than directly simulated, label it accordingly.

## 5. Map And Environment Rules

### 5.1 OSM handling

- Empty or geometry-free OSM files are valid inputs if the scenario is still
  physically meaningful.
- For empty OSM map geometry, prefer an explicit flat-terrain policy over
  throwing or silently skipping the scenario.
- Building detection must recognize both `building` and `building:part`.
- Inspect only the selected OSM file for geometry checks. Do not scan unrelated
  map files.

### 5.2 Ray tracing behavior

- Ray tracing changes must be tested in both building-present and
  building-absent scenarios.
- For geographic ray tracing, map configuration, terrain material, and site
  construction must remain mutually consistent.
- Any fallback for `NoValidPaths` or unsupported material settings must be
  explicit, logged, and reflected in channel metadata.

### 5.3 Batch safety

- Avoid GUI-dependent code paths in automated or batch tests when a non-visual
  API is available.
- Any viewer or external resource created by a block must have a cleanup path.

## 6. MATLAB Engineering Rules

- Respect System object lifecycle: setup, step, reset, release.
- Do not hide critical state in globals, persistent variables, or workspace side
  effects unless the module already relies on that pattern and the behavior is
  tested.
- Prefer explicit structs, typed metadata fields, and validation over stringly
  typed ad hoc plumbing.
- Validate configuration early. Invalid map ratios, empty type lists, and
  impossible channel settings should fail fast with actionable messages.
- Use local helper functions when they reduce ambiguity, not as cosmetic
  indirection.

## 7. Randomness And Reproducibility

- Any change affecting randomness must preserve deterministic replay when the
  same seed and scenario config are used.
- Do not add hidden RNG draws in helper functions without checking whether they
  perturb frame-level reproducibility.
- If a new stochastic branch is introduced, document which seed stream controls
  it.

## 8. Testing Standard

For every non-trivial change, run targeted tests plus at least one pipeline
regression touching the affected path.

Minimum expectations:

- Config validation tests for new config branches.
- A targeted test for the modified component.
- A regression test for the main simulation path when shared behavior changes.
- For map or channel changes, cover both the intended path and the fallback
  path.

For this repository, prioritize these categories:

1. statistical channel regression
2. empty OSM fallback regression
3. building OSM smoke test
4. annotation-field consistency
5. reproducibility under fixed seed

Do not claim a fix is complete without test evidence.

## 9. Change Workflow

Before editing:

1. trace the call chain that reaches the target behavior
2. identify the contract fields that cross module boundaries
3. check whether annotations or exported metadata depend on the same fields

While editing:

1. preserve existing interfaces unless a change is necessary
2. surface new metadata rather than burying it
3. avoid changing unrelated defaults

After editing:

1. run the narrowest useful tests first
2. run at least one broader regression if shared logic changed
3. summarize behavior changes, fallbacks, and remaining risk

## 10. Review Priorities

When reviewing or modifying code, prioritize:

1. physical correctness
2. label correctness
3. reproducibility
4. hidden shared state
5. configuration robustness
6. batch stability
7. style and cleanup

If a change makes the code cleaner but the simulated world less trustworthy, do
not make that change.

## 11. Documentation Standard

- New scenario behavior must be documented in config defaults or nearby code.
- New fallback behavior must name the trigger, the fallback model, and the
  exported metadata signal.
- When adding a field to a cross-module struct, document its meaning and unit in
  the nearest sensible location.

## 12. Default Bias

When a modeling choice is ambiguous:

- prefer explicit over implicit
- prefer physically conservative over optimistic
- prefer testable over clever
- prefer metadata-rich over silent behavior
- prefer narrow, reversible edits over broad rewrites
