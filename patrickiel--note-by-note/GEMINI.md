# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

**Note by Note** (package name `note-by-note`) is a Chrome/Firefox MV3 extension for practicing music along with any browser audio/video: pitch shift, speed, loop ranges, timeline markers, chained practice snippets, vocal reducer, and 10-band EQ. Built with WXT + Svelte 5 (runes) + TypeScript. Dev environment is Windows/PowerShell — chain shell commands with `;`, use `pnpm`.

## Commands

```powershell
pnpm install          # runs postinstall: wxt prepare + generates both worklet bundles
pnpm dev              # launch Chrome with the extension + HMR (uses a persistent .wxt/chrome-data profile)
pnpm dev:firefox      # same, Firefox
pnpm check            # svelte-check / TypeScript — the only type/lint gate
pnpm build            # production build → .output/chrome-mv3
pnpm zip              # store package
pnpm test:dsp         # fast unit tests: DSP, chords, library and sync records (node --test on src/**/*.test.ts)
pnpm release:dry      # show the release plan (version bump, tag) without changing anything
pnpm release          # full release: check + test, bump patch, build both zips, commit, tag, push
```

[scripts/release.ps1](scripts/release.ps1) is the release path. It refuses to run on a dirty tree, on a
branch other than `main`, when `main` is behind `origin/main`, or when the tag already exists; unpushed
commits are fine (they go out with the release). Non-patch bumps take a flag, so run the script directly:
`.\scripts\release.ps1 -Bump minor` (also `-Bump major`, `-Version 2.0.0`, `-SkipTests`, `-Branch <name>`).
If a build fails after the version was written, the bump is reverted. The zips land in `.output/`
(Chrome store zip, Firefox zip, and the sources zip AMO requires).

- `WXT_NO_LAUNCH=1 pnpm dev` skips the auto-launched browser; load `.output/chrome-mv3` unpacked in a normal Chrome (HMR still connects).
- **UI preview without an extension context** (mock data + in-memory `chrome` shim): build, serve `.output/chrome-mv3` statically, open `sidepanel.html?mock=1`.
- **Run a single DSP test**: `node --test src/features/vocal-reducer/engine/center-cut-dsp.test.ts` (or `node --test --test-name-pattern "WOLA" src/features/vocal-reducer/engine/center-cut-dsp.test.ts`).

### E2E (real browser, measures processed audio output)
```powershell
pnpm dlx @puppeteer/browsers install chrome@stable --path ./.browsers   # once
node e2e/make-tone.mjs ; node e2e/make-stereo-mix.mjs                    # once, generates WAV fixtures
pnpm wxt build --mode testing   # `testing` mode grants <all_urls> host perms so no native prompts block the run
node e2e/run.mjs                # add --headful to watch
node e2e/library.mjs            # background library + sync integration (pnpm test:e2e:library)
```
The harness plays a 440 Hz tone and asserts on the **processed output** (e.g. 880 Hz after +12 st) via `window.__noteByNoteDebug` in the content script and `window.__panelDebug` in the side panel.

## Architecture

This is a **multi-context extension**. The single most important structural fact: **the audio engine lives in the page (content script), not in the side panel.** The side panel is a thin UI mirror that connects to the engine over a typed `chrome.runtime` Port. This is why practice flows (loops, sequences, playback) survive the side panel closing.

### Source layout (vertical feature slices)
The tree is organized by **feature**, not by layer:
- **`src/core/`** — shared platform: `engine/` (controller, media-engine/-detect, attach-audio), `audio/` (pipeline, fft, silence-detector), `messaging/` (protocol shell, ports, rpc), `model/` (shared types + defaults + format + track-identity + thumbnail), `persist/` (library, backup, migration), and `state/` (session, library, track-sync, connect, view).
- **`src/features/<feature>/`** — one folder per product feature (chords, pitch, speed, vocal-reducer, eq, loops, markers, snippets, count-in, library, sync, settings, shortcuts), each with an `engine/` subfolder (content-script code: worklets, schedulers, DSP factories) and/or a `panel/` subfolder (side-panel stores + components), plus optional `protocol.ts` (its wire-message fragment). **`engine/` and `panel/` never cross-import**, so the content and panel bundles stay separate.
- **`src/ui/`** — shared/presentational UI (Workspace, Panel, PanelStack, Timeline, chrome bars, `shared/` primitives, icons, dismiss).
- **`src/dev/`** — preview-only helpers (`browser-shim`, `mock`).
- **`src/entrypoints/`** — thin WXT composition roots (unchanged location).

**Dependency direction:** `entrypoints → core composition roots (pipeline, controller, protocol, App, track-sync) → features → core primitives (model, messaging, audio/fft, ui)`. Composition roots wire feature behavior directly; features never import the orchestrators. Domain types stay central in `core/model/types.ts` (the shared engine↔panel contract).

### Execution contexts (`src/entrypoints/`)
- **`sidepanel/`** — the Svelte UI. Holds no engine state of its own; mirrors the active tab's engine.
- **`content.ts` → `src/core/engine/`** — the engine. Media detection, connection state machine, transport, and the Web Audio DSP chain; the loop/sequence/count-in schedulers it drives live in `src/features/*/engine/`. Guards against double-boot via `window.__noteByNote`; tears down on `ctx.onInvalidated` (extension reload) to avoid orphaned instances fighting the page.
- **`offscreen/`** — hosts the tab-capture DSP pipeline (one `AudioContext` per captured tab). Same shared pipeline as direct mode.
- **`background.ts`** — service worker broker: per-origin permission grants, content-script registration/injection, tab-capture stream brokering, offscreen document lifecycle. Reconciles the persistent content-script registration from the actual `permissions` API (single source of truth) on every permission change or worker restart. Also owns tab-scoped panel visibility (Chromium): the side panel is disabled by default and the icon click toggles it per tab, so Chrome hides it on other tabs and re-shows it on return. Chrome gives each tab its own panel document, opened at `sidepanel.html?tabId=N` so the panel pins itself to that tab and the worker can recognise the document in `runtime.getContexts` (which reports `tabId: -1` for side panels). Measured gotchas, all documented in [core/side-panel.ts](src/core/side-panel.ts): the toolbar click's gesture dies at the first `await` in the worker, so the toggle snapshots "is it showing" via `getContexts`, fires `setOptions` + `open` synchronously (a no-op when already open), and disables the tab afterwards if the snapshot said it was showing; enabling a tab does not show the panel there, so panel-initiated new tabs (local player, Songs list) go through `openTabWithPanel` **from the panel document** (whose click activation survives awaits), not via the background. Firefox's sidebar is window-global — no per-tab behavior.
- **`local-player/`** — a full extension page that plays local files and speaks the same engine protocol via its own tab.

### Three connection modes (the fallback chain)
1. **Direct** — Web Audio pipeline attached straight to the page's `<media>` element. Full feature set (YouTube works).
2. **Tab capture** — fallback when the element is CORS-tainted, DRM'd, or the page CSP blocks the worklet: all tab audio is processed in the offscreen document (pitch only; transport still drives the element if one exists). Shows as `connected-capture` or `connected-hybrid`.
3. **Local file** — the local-player page, where everything works.

`ConnectionState` transitions (`detecting → connected-direct / pitch-unavailable / media-paused / restricted / no-player / stale …`) are driven by [controller.ts](src/core/engine/controller.ts) engine-side and mirrored into `session.connection` panel-side.

### Shared audio pipeline (`src/core/audio/`)
[pipeline.ts](src/core/audio/pipeline.ts) is a **composition root**: it imports each feature's DSP stage factory from `src/features/*/engine/` and wires **one wet/dry graph used identically** by the content script, offscreen document, and local player:
```
source ─┬─ dryGain ───────────────────────────────────────┬─ master ─ destination
        └─ wetIn ─ reducer ─┬─ stretch ─ stretchWet ─┬─ eq ┘
                            └─ stretchBypass ─────────┘
```
- dry⇄wet crossfade = the **Power** toggle; stretch bypass = zero-latency path while pitch is neutral (preserves A/V sync for speed-only).
- Two WASM AudioWorklets: **Rubber Band** (pitch — the realtime R3 "Finer" engine, `src/features/pitch/engine/rubberband.worklet.ts`) and the **first-party vocal reducer** (STFT center-cut, `src/features/vocal-reducer/engine/vocal-reducer.worklet.ts`, DSP core in `center-cut-dsp.ts` + shared `src/core/audio/fft.ts`). Loads overlap via `Promise.all`; if a worklet fails, the dry route stays live so audio never drops. (A third, non-WASM analysis worklet — the PCM tap for chord detection — lives in `src/features/chords/engine/pcm-tap.worklet.ts`.)

### Worklets & CSP (important, non-obvious)
Both worklet processors are shipped as **static files under `public/worklets/`** and loaded from `chrome-extension://` URLs, because Blob-URL worklets are blocked by the extension CSP and many sites' CSP.
- The Rubber Band worklet bundles the GPL `@echogarden/rubberband-wasm` Emscripten glue via `scripts/build-rubberband-worklet.mjs` (esbuild → IIFE). Its WASM ships **separately** as `public/worklets/rb.wasm` (copied from the npm package by `scripts/copy-rubberband-wasm.mjs` at postinstall; committed): the main thread `fetch`es those bytes and hands them to the processor via `processorOptions.wasmBytes`, which the worklet instantiates with `wasmBinary`/`instantiateWasm` — no fetch/eval/Blob inside the worklet, so it stays CSP-safe. The generated `rubberband-worklet.js` is **gitignored** — you must `pnpm install` before anything audio-related works.
- The vocal-reducer bundle is built by `scripts/build-vocal-worklet.mjs` and the PCM tap by `scripts/build-pcm-tap-worklet.mjs` (esbuild → IIFE). All worklet bundles are built at postinstall **and rebuilt on every `wxt build`** via the `build:before` hook in [wxt.config.ts](wxt.config.ts); the `build-*-worklet.mjs` `entryPoints` point at `src/features/*/engine/*.worklet.ts` (outputs stay `public/worklets/*.js`). **In `postinstall` the build scripts must run *before* `wxt prepare`**, because `wxt prepare` derives the `PublicPath` union in `.wxt/types/paths.d.ts` from the files actually present in `public/` — prepare first and the three `browser.runtime.getURL('/worklets/…')` call sites fail `pnpm check` on any fresh clone (they pass on a warm tree only because a later prepare regenerates the types). Because those esbuild bundles have **no `@/` alias**, worklet sources and anything they import must use **relative** imports. Editing a `src/features/*/engine/*.worklet.ts` or `center-cut-dsp.ts` mid-`pnpm dev` does **not** hot-reload — rerun the matching `scripts/build-*-worklet.mjs` (or restart the dev server).
- Pages whose CSP lacks `wasm-unsafe-eval` make the pitch worklet's ready handshake time out → "Pitch not available" + tab-capture prompt (verified in E2E).

### Messaging (`src/core/messaging/`)
[protocol.ts](src/core/messaging/protocol.ts) composes the wire protocol from **per-feature fragments** (`src/features/<f>/protocol.ts`) — each feature declares its own `EngineEvent`/`EngineCommand` members and `protocol.ts` unions them (the `snapshot` event keeps its per-feature fields inline as a documented exception). Change a fragment or the shell and both ends must follow:
- `EngineEvent` (engine → panel) and `EngineCommand` (panel → engine) flow over `TypedPort` (a thin typed wrapper around `chrome.runtime.Port`, `ports.ts`). ~30 Hz playhead updates.
- `OffscreenCommand` — background → offscreen `runtime` messages (offscreen filters by `target: 'offscreen'`).
- `ProtocolMap` — request/response RPC handled by the background worker via `@webext-core/messaging` (`ensureInjected`, `startCapture`, `revokeAllPermissions`, etc.).

### State layer (Svelte 5 runes stores, `*.svelte.ts`)
Runes stores (classes with `$state`), one singleton exported per file. All panel-side. Split by ownership:
- **Core (`src/core/state/`):** `session` mirrors the active tab's engine and provides panel commands; `library` holds the panel's single saved-data snapshot; `connection` owns permissions, injection, port lifecycle and capture, routing chord events directly; `track-sync` loads saved practice data and wires feature edits; `view` selects the open panel.
- **Feature-owned (`src/features/<f>/panel/`):** `markers`, `snippets`, `chords`, `settings`, `favorites`/`history` (library), `eq-presets`, `shortcuts`. Preview data (`mock`) lives in `src/dev/`.
- App loads the library once. Settings, UI preferences, presets and song lists derive from it; App effects apply the theme and send engine settings. Features submit per-track edits through track-sync. UI preferences are device-local: the panel shows an edit at once and drops the overlay when the storage watch confirms it, so a toggle never waits on the worker.

### Persistence & sync

- One local library owns shared songs/settings/presets/order and device-local Recent,
  UI preferences, last-used parameters and analysis. See core/persist/library.ts.
- The background service is the only writer (library-background.ts). Panels use
  library-client.ts commands and one storage watch. Commands patch the latest saved
  data; Recent and Favorites are projections, not persistent song copies. A saved
  song outlives Recent (its practice returns when the page is replayed, which is
  what Auto Save off relies on); clearing history is what removes every
  non-favorited song, listed or not.
- Track-sync loads a practice session once and submits edits to the saved library.
  Restoration uses the initialized panel mirror and does not emit user edits.
  Parameter, marker and snippet edits capture their track and values before being
  coalesced; pending patches remain readable until the library watch acknowledges
  their committed revision. Switching tracks or hiding the panel flushes the batch.
  Receiving remote changes never reloads or silently replaces the active session.
  Explicit imports reload active sessions and advance a device-local import
  revision; the writer rejects practice edits carrying an older revision.
  Feature persistence is wired directly in track-sync; there is no descriptor registry.
- The writer validates the resulting library before every command commit. Connection
  failures use connection state; only library initialization can open recovery.
- Sync copies the same SharedLibrary snapshot used locally (records.ts). One
  updatedAt timestamp chooses the whole winner; equal dates adopt the remote copy.
  There are no field merges or deletion markers. Song dates only support display
  and sorting. Gzip data spans fixed size-limited slots; a hash prevents partial or
  mixed snapshots from being applied. An over-budget upload drops the least
  recently used non-favorited songs (fitSnapshot bisects for the smallest cut) and
  saves that re-dated trimmed copy locally, so the library and the upload stay one
  snapshot; nothing is trimmed while sync is off, and an overflow of favorites
  alone still fails, preserving local data and the last successful upload.
  Background alarms retry independently of panels.
  Identical snapshots do not rewrite storage or toggle sync status. Missing
  headers are recovered from complete gzip chunks; partial headerless uploads
  get a persisted grace period before repair from the complete local copy.
- Backups use the readable v2 library schema. legacy-backup.ts reads the
  released v1 format, and
  library-migration.ts collapses its old copies once.
  Only released formats need compatibility adapters; intermediate PR formats do not.
  Old local storage is retained for recovery, but only local:library is used after
  migration.
  Automatic legacy migration salvages fields independently (library-recovery.ts).
  Invalid current libraries remain untouched and open a recovery screen; a valid
  recovery import retains the damaged value under local:libraryRecovery.
- Web identity uses provider ID/normalized URL. Title and duration are metadata.
  Local files retain a filename discriminator independent of the extension URL.

## Conventions & gotchas
- Path alias `@/` → `src/` (so `@/core/*`, `@/features/*`, `@/ui/*`, `@/dev/*` all resolve). WXT provides the `#imports` virtual module (`storage`, `defineBackground`, `defineContentScript`, the `browser` global) — no explicit import of `browser`.
- **`@/` does not work in two contexts** (they don't share the WXT/Vite resolver): the `node --test` files (`src/**/*.test.ts` and the modules they import as *values* — `fft.ts`, `center-cut-dsp.ts`, `detect-bpm.ts`, `backup-codec.ts`, `sync/persist/records.ts`, `core/persist/{library,library-migration,legacy-backup,rekey}.ts`, and what those pull in: `defaults.ts`, `thumbnail.ts`, `track-identity.ts`) must use **relative imports with explicit `.ts` extensions**; the esbuild worklet bundles (`src/features/*/engine/*.worklet.ts`) must use **relative imports**. (`import type` is erased, so type-only imports may omit the extension.)
- **Both browsers build MV3** (`manifestVersion: 3` is pinned in [wxt.config.ts](wxt.config.ts) — Firefox would otherwise default to MV2 and drop `optional_host_permissions`). Chromium-only APIs are gated on the build-time flags in [core/platform.ts](src/core/platform.ts) (`CAN_CAPTURE_TAB`, `HAS_SIDE_PANEL_API`), never on runtime `browser.*` probes: Firefox has no `tabCapture`/`offscreen` (so no capture fallback — the offscreen entrypoint is excluded from that build) and no `sidePanel` (the same page is registered as `sidebar_action`). Panel-side the capability travels as a **prop**: an absent `oncapture`/`ontabaudio` is what makes the shared UI drop the affordance.
- Debug globals are named `__noteByNote*` / `__panelDebug`. The processor name literal is `note-by-note-center-cut` and **must match on both sides** (`vocal-reducer.worklet.ts` registers it, `vocal-reducer.ts` constructs it) — mismatches throw `InvalidStateError` at runtime and `tsc` won't catch them.
- A `MediaElementSource` can be created only once per element per document lifetime, so **extension reloads require a page reload** to reattach.
- The `README.md` is the best prose overview.
- There is no test runner config beyond `node --test`; `pnpm check` (svelte-check) is the type gate. There is no ESLint/Prettier config — match surrounding style.
