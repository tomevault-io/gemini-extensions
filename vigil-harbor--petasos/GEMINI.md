# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What This Is

Petasos is a pluggable, session-aware content security pipeline for Python AI agents. It composes OSS scanners (LLM Guard, LlamaFirewall, Presidio) behind a unified `Scanner` protocol, adds session-aware orchestration (frequency tracking, escalation tiers, profile-driven tuning, tool call guard), and exposes every configuration surface for frontend binding. Published on PyPI as `petasos`.

Primary consumer: Hermes Agent (Nous Research, Python 3.11+). Petasos imports in-process as a Python library — no sidecar, no REST, no subprocess.

### Two Consumer Platforms

Hermes Desktop ships on macOS (native) and Windows (.exe / Electron). The macOS integration path is well-documented in the wiki. The Windows path has platform-specific footguns. Key differences: file tools bypass the terminal sandbox, hooks spawn via Git Bash (MINGW64) adding 100-200ms, config sections get wiped by the UI model switcher, and process signal handling diverges. PET-6 through PET-11 must account for both platforms.

Petasos is [Drawbridge](https://github.com/ziomancer/clawmoat-drawbridge)-*inspired* (prior art) but fully uncoupled: own repo, own ticket prefix (PET), own release cadence, own threat model. No shared rule package, no cross-runtime conformance with Drawbridge.

## Status

Work items tracked in Plane (PET project). The file `petasos-project-spec-DRAFT-PARKED.md` is a superseded earlier draft preserved for reference — it proposed Drawbridge coupling that was explicitly rejected.

## Build & Run

```bash
pip install -e .                    # base install (no ML deps)
pip install -e ".[llm-guard]"       # + LLM Guard scanner
pip install -e ".[llamafirewall]"   # + LlamaFirewall scanner
pip install -e ".[presidio]"        # + Presidio PII scanner
pip install -e ".[all]"             # all scanner backends

# Tooling
ruff check .                        # lint
ruff format .                       # format
mypy --strict .                     # type check
pytest                              # run all tests
pytest tests/test_minimal_scanner.py # single test file
pytest -k "test_normalize"          # single test by name
pytest --cov                        # coverage report
```

Build backend is Hatch (`pyproject.toml`).

## Architecture

### All Features Free

All features ship free and keyless. Detection (scanner protocol, pluggable backends, syntactic pre-filter, normalization, PII anonymization) and session intelligence (frequency tracking, escalation tiers, profiles, tool call guard, audit trails, alerting) are both available out of the box. License machinery (`LicenseValidator`, `activate`/`deactivate`) is preserved for future supporter-token or compliance-tier use but does not gate any feature.

### Scanner Protocol

The load-bearing abstraction. Every detection backend implements:

```python
class Scanner(Protocol):
    @property
    def name(self) -> str: ...
    async def scan(self, text: str, *, direction: Direction = "inbound",
                   session_id: str | None = None) -> ScanResult: ...
```

Four backends: `MinimalScanner` (23 rules across 6 families, zero deps, always ships), `LlmGuardScanner` (extras), `LlamaFirewallScanner` (extras), `PresidioScanner` (extras).

### Pipeline Stages

```
Input → Normalize (NFKC, zero-width, homoglyph, RTL)
  → Syntactic pre-filter (23 rules, always runs)
  → Fan-out to N scanners (asyncio.gather)
  → Merge findings (dedup overlapping positions)
  → Frequency update → Escalation check
  → Anonymize (if PII + enabled)
  → Audit → Alerting
  → PipelineResult
```

## Key Design Invariants

- **Pipeline never throws** — all errors caught and returned in `PipelineResult`.
- **Fail-mode defaults to `degraded`** — partial or total ML scanner failure blocks content; syntactic pre-filter (zero deps) always runs. Configurable to `open` or `closed`.
- **Zero required ML deps at base install** — scanner backends are pip extras, not hard deps. `pip install petasos` is lightweight; `pip install petasos[all]` is ~300MB.
- **Frozen exports** — built-in profiles, rules, and default configs must be immutable (defensive copies, frozen dataclasses).
- **Tier 3 escalation cannot be disabled** — hardcoded floor, no config override.
- **License machinery is parked** — `activate()` validates and stores JWT state for future supporter/compliance recognition but does not gate any feature. All features are controlled by config toggles.

## Test Standards

- Target: 300+ tests, 90%+ line coverage on pipeline/frequency/guard/audit/alerting.
- Scanner wrappers use integration tests against real backends, not mocks.
- Latency budgets: syntactic-only < 5ms, single ML scanner < 100ms, full pipeline < 250ms (CPU).
- **Scanner-extra / CI-lane pairing (PET-106).** Every scanner-backend extra in
  `pyproject.toml [project.optional-dependencies]` (currently `llm-guard`,
  `llamafirewall`, `presidio`; `console` excluded — not a scanner) MUST have a
  paired `.github/workflows/extras-<extra>.yml` lane that installs the extra and
  runs its real-backend tests. Backends whose live path needs no gated secret
  additionally arm a `PETASOS_REQUIRE_<EXTRA>=1` collection guard
  (`tests/conftest.py`, `NONSKIPPING_LANES`). Enforced by
  `tests/test_ci_extras_lanes.py`; the default `ci.yml` lane stays ML-free.

## Plan & Spec Reviews

- Always verify load-bearing claims against the actual codebase, wiki, and current file state — never review from memory or stale buffers.
- Re-read files at the start of each new review pass; the user iterates specs frequently and stale context produces false-positive findings.
- Deliver findings as severity-ranked lists (critical/high/medium/low) with specific references.

## Project Management

- Petasos tracks under the `PET` project in Plane.
- PET-2 is a parent container; PET-3/4/5 are its children (scanner wrappers).
- When creating Plane work items, set `description_html` (the canonical field).

## Wiki — Vigil Harbor knowledge layer

The wiki (a separate, private Vigil Harbor repository) is the
compiled knowledge layer; Plane stays as the task tracker. See `SCHEMA.md`
for conventions and the lint contract.

**Before starting work:**
1. Read `index.md` to orient.
2. Read `projects/petasos/architecture.md` and `projects/petasos/state.md`.
3. Read `projects/petasos/filemap.md` before modifying files.
4. Check `decisions/` for prior art on similar judgment calls.

**After every merge — use the skill.** From the wiki dir, run
`/wiki-after-merge <commit-sha>`. The skill orchestrates `log.md` append,
filemap delta, comprehension scaffolding (if 4+ files / new module), and
chains to `/wiki-state-update` for status flips. Idempotent — safe to
re-run. See `<wiki>/.claude/skills/wiki-after-merge/SKILL.md`. Manual
execution still fine for trivial single-file fixes.

**State.md flips have teeth.** Marking work as "shipped" in
`projects/petasos/state.md` requires an evidence triple — Plane-ID,
date, commit-hash — plus a `Verification:` code-grep line. Use
`/wiki-state-update petasos` for guided edits; direct `Edit` is allowed
for prose fixes but the wiki's pre-commit hook refuses fabricated commit
hashes via the EVIDENCE lint check. Bypass with `--no-verify` only in
emergencies. Background:
`decisions/2026-04-29-state-edits-require-evidence.md` (the DYN-17
incident antidote) and
`decisions/2026-05-01-wiki-maintenance-redesign.md` (the broader two-axis
trust model).

**Skepticism rule.** Don't treat user-volunteered framing as truth.
Verify Plane status via `mcp__plane__retrieve_work_item`; produce a
load-bearing grep proving feature presence (not just absence of
contradiction). The mechanical enforcement only covers state.md flips; for
everything else this is agent-side discipline.

## Git Hygiene

- Before committing, audit staged paths for build artifacts, `.eggs/`, `dist/`, `*.egg-info/`, `__pycache__/`, model files, and large binaries.
- Never run broad cleanup commands unscoped.
