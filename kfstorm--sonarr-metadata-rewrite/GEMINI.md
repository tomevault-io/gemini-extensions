## Project Overview

Sonarr Metadata Rewrite - A compatibility layer that monitors
Sonarr-generated .nfo files and overwrites them with TMDB translations in
desired languages, and rewrites poster/clearlogo images to language-specific
variants when available. This addresses [Sonarr Issue #269](
https://github.com/Sonarr/Sonarr/issues/269) (multilingual metadata) and
[Sonarr Issue #6663](https://github.com/Sonarr/Sonarr/issues/6663)
(localized images).

The project includes a metadata translation service and an image rewrite
pipeline with real-time file monitoring, TMDB API integration, intelligent
caching, comprehensive error handling, and reprocessing avoidance.

## Essential Development Commands

```

## Technical Architecture

### Current Implementation

Metadata translation and image rewrite service with Click framework providing:

- Entry point: `sonarr_metadata_rewrite.main:cli` command that runs a
  persistent service (CLI: `sonarr-metadata-rewrite`)
- Real-time file monitoring with watchdog for immediate processing (.nfo and
  rewritable images)
- Periodic directory scanning for batch processing of existing files
- TMDB API integration with intelligent caching and exponential backoff retry
  for rate limit handling
- Reprocessing avoidance to prevent unnecessary file updates and API calls
- Pydantic-based configuration with comprehensive settings validation
- Atomic file operations with optional backup functionality
- Project structure follows Python package standards with src/ layout and
  _version.py

### Core Components

1. **CLI Interface** (`main.py`)
Click-based command that runs a persistent service. Performs comprehensive
configuration validation on startup, installs signal handlers for graceful
shutdown, starts the service synchronously, and uses proper exit codes on
failure.

1. **RewriteService** (`rewrite_service.py`)
Orchestrator coordinating metadata and image processing components. Manages
file monitoring, scanning, and processing lifecycle, and handles
startup/shutdown and resource cleanup.

1. **MetadataProcessor** (`metadata_processor.py`)
Complete .nfo file processing workflow: extract TMDB IDs from XML, select
translation based on language preferences, and write atomically with optional
backup creation.

1. **Translator** (`translator.py`)
TMDB API client using httpx with diskcache-backed caching and exponential
backoff for HTTP 429. Supports series and episode translations. For images,
fetches `/tv/{id}/images` or `/tv/{id}/season/{s}/images`, filters locally for
preferred language-country (e.g., `en-US`) and chooses the first exact match;
does not pass `include_image_language` due to TMDB API issues.

1. **FileMonitor** (`file_monitor.py`)
Real-time file system monitoring using watchdog. Processes .nfo and image files
on close/move events. Recursive directory watching.

1. **FileScanner** (`file_scanner.py`)
Periodic directory scanning for batch processing. Scans for both `.nfo` files
and rewritable images. Configurable scan intervals, thread-based background
scanning with graceful shutdown.

1. **Configuration** (`config.py`)
Pydantic Settings-based configuration with custom env source parsing
`PREFERRED_LANGUAGES` as a comma-separated string (not JSON) into `list[str]`.
Includes `ENABLE_IMAGE_REWRITE` flag (default: true). Loads from .env and
performs comprehensive validation.

1. **ImageProcessor** (`image_processor.py`)
Complete image rewrite workflow: identify rewritable image files (poster,
clearlogo, season posters), extract TMDB IDs, fetch image candidates via
Translator, select best match based on language preferences, download and
rewrite with embedded marker, and atomic writes with optional backup.

1. **ImageUtils** (`image_utils.py`)
Image metadata helpers for embedding and reading markers in PNG (tEXt chunk) and
JPEG (EXIF UserComment) formats. Markers contain TMDB file_path and language info
to enable reprocessing avoidance.

1. **RollbackService** (`rollback_service.py`)
Backup restoration service that reverts .nfo and image files to their original
state. Removes conflicting extension variants during image rollback.

1. **BackupUtils** (`backup_utils.py`)
Backup file operations for creating and managing backup copies of original files
when `ORIGINAL_FILES_BACKUP_DIR` is configured.

1. **FileUtils** (`file_utils.py`)
Atomic file write operations using temporary files with proper replacement to
ensure data integrity during updates.

1. **RetryUtils** (`retry_utils.py`)
Retry logic with exponential backoff for handling transient failures, particularly
for TMDB API rate limiting (HTTP 429) responses.

1. **Data Models** (`models.py`)
TmdbIds: TMDB identifier structures for series/episodes. TranslatedContent:
Translated metadata containers. ProcessResult: base outcome. MetadataProcessResult:
NFO-specific. ImageCandidate: TMDB image candidate (file_path, iso_639_1,
iso_3166_1). ImageProcessResult: image-specific outcome.

1. **Version Management** (`_version.py`)
Hatch-generated version file from VCS tags with dynamic version handling and
development fallback.

### TMDB API Integration Design

- **Text endpoints**: `/tv/{series_id}/translations` and
  `/tv/{series_id}/season/{season_number}/episode/{episode_number}/translations`
- **Image endpoints**: `/tv/{series_id}/images` and `/tv/{series_id}/season/{season_number}/images`
  - Don't pass `include_image_language`; fetch all and filter client-side in
    code due to TMDB API quirk
- **Rate Limits**: TMDB has rate limits, and explicit rate limiting with
  exponential backoff retry is implemented to handle HTTP 429 responses
- **Language Codes**: ISO 639-1 format with optional country codes (e.g.,
  "zh-CN", "ja-JP")
- **ID Extraction**: TMDB IDs from `<uniqueid type="tmdb">` XML tags in
  .nfo files

### Development Tooling

- **Package Manager**: uv with pyproject.toml dependency management
- **Code Quality**: Black (line-length: 88), Ruff (E/W/F/I/B/C4/UP rules),
  MyPy (strict typing) with Pydantic plugin
- **Architecture**: Tach module dependency enforcement with tach.toml for
  module boundaries (including `_version`)
- **Testing**: pytest with coverage, separate unit/integration test
  directories with shared container infrastructure
- **Integration Testing**: Docker-based Sonarr integration with comprehensive
  test scenarios
- **Dead Code**: Vulture with whitelist support
- **Automation**: pre-commit hooks for all quality checks

### Image Rewriting Design

- Target filenames: `poster.*`, `clearlogo.*`, `seasonNN-poster.*`,
  `season-specials-poster.*` where extension is one of `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`
- TMDB base URL: `https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original`; use candidate `file_path`
- Selection policy: match exact language-country in order of `preferred_languages`
- Reprocessing avoidance: embed marker with `file_path`, `iso_639_1`, `iso_3166_1`
  in PNG tEXt or JPEG EXIF UserComment; if marker matches current selection,
  skip writing
- Atomic writes: write to temp file and replace; normalize extension according
  to TMDB candidate while preserving original stem
- Backups: if `ORIGINAL_FILES_BACKUP_DIR` is set, copy original before rewrite
- Rollback: restores both `.nfo` and image files; removes conflicting ext variants

### Key Technical Constraints

- **Python**: >=3.10 with strict typing enforcement
- **Dependencies**: Core runtime deps (Click, Pydantic, httpx, watchdog,
  diskcache) plus Pillow and piexif for image processing
- **TMDB Rate Limits**: TMDB has rate limits, and explicit rate limiting with
  exponential backoff retry is implemented - the service automatically retries
  rate-limited requests with configurable delays
- **File Format**: Sonarr generates XML .nfo files with TMDB IDs
- **Target Files**: `tvshow.nfo` (series), episode-specific .nfo files, and
  image files matching the patterns above
- **Service Architecture**: Long-running daemon process with graceful
  shutdown support
- **Reprocessing Avoidance**: Implemented to prevent unnecessary API calls and
  file writes for both text and images
