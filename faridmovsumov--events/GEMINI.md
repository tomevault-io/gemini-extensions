# Family Events Assistant

This repository is a personal assistant for finding interesting events and activities for our family.

## Family Profile

- **Family size**: 3
- **Members**: Husband, Wife, Son (6 years old, born ~2020)
- **Location**: Zaandam, Netherlands
- **Languages**: English preferred (Dutch is limited)
- **Travel radius**: Flexible - Zaandam, Amsterdam, and beyond. Location closeness is nice but not a hard requirement.

## Preferences

### What We Want
1. **Creative/building activities**: workshops where we build, make, or create something together
2. **Brain challenges**: escape rooms, puzzles, scavenger hunts, quiz nights - things that use intelligence
3. **Competitive activities**: events where we compete as a family team against other families
4. **Social/interactive**: activities where we meet and interact with other families, not just our own
5. **Physical challenges**: climbing, obstacle courses, sports - active things we do together

### What We DON'T Want
- Generic tourist attractions or sightseeing (we're locals, not tourists)
- Generic national holidays like King's Day (obvious, not really for kids)
- Passive activities (just watching something)
- Drop-off activities (must be together as family)
- "Just another museum visit" without interactive/creative element

### Key Criteria
- **Goal**: Spend quality time together as a family
- **Age-appropriate**: Must be suitable for a 6-year-old (update age as child grows)
- **International-friendly**: Prefer English-friendly activities, but not a hard requirement
- **Together**: Activities the whole family can enjoy together (not drop-off activities)
- **Engaging**: Use our intelligence, creativity, or physical skills - not passive entertainment
- **Social**: Prefer activities where we interact with other families when possible

### Budget
- Paid events are totally fine - don't focus on free events
- Open to all price ranges
- Note costs when researching so family can decide

## How to Use This Repository
