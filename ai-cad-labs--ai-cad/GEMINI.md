# AGENTS.md · AI-CAD

Agent-first onboarding for this repository, for any coding assistant:
Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, opencode, Gemini CLI, and others.
If you are an AI agent (or a human) working in this codebase, read this first.
Then match your next read to your mode:
**developing or changing the system** means also reading [`README.md`](README.md)
before touching anything
(it carries the project-level context this file deliberately does not duplicate:
the guiding design principles, what a run produces, the run gallery);
**merely running design runs** (execution mode) does not require the README.
Many assistants read `AGENTS.md` natively as the project-rules entry point;
Claude Code and Gemini CLI arrive here
through the one-line imports in `CLAUDE.md` and `GEMINI.md`.

AI-CAD is a multi-agent system that designs manufacturable parts and assemblies:
LLM agents generate CadQuery (parametric Python CAD) code,
render it to engineering views,
evaluate it against design-for-manufacturing / design-for-assembly rules,
and iteratively repair the geometry.
Orchestration lives in agent instructions
plus a deterministic, bash-callable Python tool layer,
so the product runs on Claude Code today
and is symlink-portable to other harnesses.

## Read-first map (in order, for any change)

1. **This file, then `README.md` (required in development mode)**:
   this file is the tactical layer (conventions, runbook, fences);
   the README is the project-level layer
   (guiding design principles, artifact expectations, the gallery)
   that any change to the system must stay aligned with.
   The two are deliberately non-overlapping: read both, duplicate neither.
2. **`.shared/agents/<role>/instructions.md`**: the 9 agent roles (the operating brains).
3. **`.shared/skills/`**: the knowledge layer
   (cadquery-cookbook, dfm-rules, run-reflection,
   cadquery-anti-hallucination, and the two reserved stubs).
4. **Design system (frontend work)**: `frontend/.interface-design/system.md` +
   `frontend/src/index.css` (Tailwind v4 token layer).
5. **[`docs/dev/local-setup.md`](docs/dev/local-setup.md)**: developer environment setup,
   including local clones of the upstream CadQuery repos for deep reference.
6. **[`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md)**: the docs index
   (the glossary, the architecture decision records, and navigation pointers).

## Sibling repositories

- [`ai-cad-labs/ai-cad-example-projects`](https://github.com/ai-cad-labs/ai-cad-example-projects):
  the run gallery of real, unedited design runs from this system (both harness generations).
  Consult it to see what healthy run output looks like before changing pipeline behavior.
- [`ai-cad-labs/ai-cad-pydanticai`](https://github.com/ai-cad-labs/ai-cad-pydanticai):
  the predecessor PydanticAI implementation (frozen; research value).
  Documents the architecture this harness grew out of.

## Runbook

**Environment**: `uv sync`;
install system cairo
(macOS: `brew install cairo`, and the renderer self-sets the `DYLD` path;
Debian/Ubuntu: `apt-get install libcairo2`).
No `.env` and no API keys exist by design:
the `claude` CLI carries its own auth.
DFMA/vision evaluation runs on Claude via the `claude` CLI:
optional env `CAD_EVALUATOR_MODEL` pins a model
(a large-context variant is recommended for long pipelines),
else the CLI default;
`CAD_EVALUATOR_TIMEOUT_S` defaults to 300;
`CAD_EVALUATOR_CONCURRENCY` caps concurrent evaluations in a sweep (defaults to 4).
(`.claude/settings.json` ships an optional `CAD_EVALUATOR_MODEL` pin
you can override or remove.)

**Launch a design run**
(headless, detached;
dispatch the orchestrator SYNCHRONOUSLY within the turn,
because headless `-p` exits at turn end
and would orphan-kill an in-process background child):

```bash
claude -p "<entry prompt: create projects/<name>/ with goals.md, dispatch the orchestrator to
run to completion within THIS turn, write smoke_report.md, THEN synthesize run_reflection.md
(a run without its reflection is invisible to the self-improvement loop)>" \
  --permission-mode bypassPermissions --max-turns 100 --output-format stream-json --verbose \
  < /dev/null > logs/<name>-run.jsonl 2>&1 &
```

Monitor via the **project directory**
(files are truth;
plain `-p --verbose` without `stream-json` buffers until exit)
or the frontend's ActivityStrip.

**Resume a crashed run**: relaunch `claude -p` with an entry prompt that says RESUMING,
names the project dir,
and instructs state reconstruction from the filesystem
(design_log tail, open_issues, `spec_validator --query=state`)
plus a completed-vs-remaining phase list.
The mortal-orchestrator design recovers from files alone:
no checkpoint file is needed.
A resume that completes the run inherits reflection duty:
fold the predecessor's `reflection_notes.md` into the final `run_reflection.md`.

**Frontend**: `cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev` → **localhost:5199**
(pinned via `strictPort`).
Read-only over `projects/`:
the filesystem is the API;
defend this decoupling.

## Working with agents in this repo (fleet rules)

When a session here dispatches subagents or launches runs:

- **Half-scope missions**: a mission produces OR verifies, not both;
  the split yields cleaner work and reviewable diffs.
- **Output-flood guards, always**: pipe commands through `| tail`,
  never list/grep/find over `node_modules`, `reference/`, `.venv`, or `.git`;
  run test runners in quiet/dot-reporter mode.
- **Declare file ownership per prompt**: each agent owns explicit paths;
  overlap is coordinated, not assumed.
- **Salvage, don't restart**: when an agent dies mid-mission
  its work usually survives on disk;
  map the wreckage and dispatch a finisher rather than starting over.
- **Contract-decouple parallel builders**:
  write the interface (JSON shape, CLI flags, file convention) into the spec first,
  then build both sides against it concurrently.

## Harness-agent hardening notes (the product's own 9 agents)

- **Gate verdicts are stochastic** (LLM vision):
  on an internally-inconsistent rejection,
  re-run once before counting it.
- **Wireframe renders breed vision false-positives**:
  ground-truth against analytics + multiple views before repairing.
- **`parallel_safe` annotations are honored in production**:
  planners must keep emitting them.
- **DFMA is a unit-test suite for parts**:
  repair agents write to `part.proposal.py`, not `part.py`;
  the regression gate (`dfma_evaluator --judge-proposal`)
  compares against the stable version
  with severity-weighted scoring (critical=10, major=5, minor=1)
  and auto-rejects proposals that raise the score, with full traceability.
- **Fillets are deferred**: they cause the most CadQuery failures;
  get correct geometry first.

## Rules that keep this repo coherent

- **Edit canonical content in `.shared/` only**:
  `.claude/` and `.opencode/` are symlinks into it.
- **`projects/` is run output**: never hand-edit;
  the frontend and future replay depend on its conventions.
  It is untracked by design (so is `logs/`).
- **Harness-agnostic where convenient**:
  keep new features portable across harnesses;
  when agnosticism gets expensive,
  bias to Claude Code and write docs at two levels (abstracted + harness-specific)
  so a future harness only amends the specific layer.
- **Verify CadQuery methods exist** before using them:
  LLMs hallucinate CadQuery API surface;
  the `cadquery-anti-hallucination` skill
  catalogs the common traps and their real alternatives.
- **[`docs/api/`](docs/api/README.md) is generated from the tool docstrings**:
  never hand-edit a page there;
  after changing a tool-layer docstring or public surface,
  run `uv run --frozen python tests/test_api_docs.py --write`
  (the tests fail until the reference is regenerated).
- **Architectural decisions land in
  [`docs/architecture-decision-records/`](docs/architecture-decision-records/README.md)**:
  a change that makes, reverses, or contradicts an architectural decision
  adds or supersedes a record in the same change
  (new numbered record; the old one's Status becomes "Superseded by NNNN";
  an accepted record is never rewritten).
  Session-close ritual for development sessions:
  before ending, distill any new decisions of record into this log.
