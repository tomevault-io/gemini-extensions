## Setup Detection

On every conversation start, check the user's setup state before doing anything else:

### Step 1: Check for a master knowledgebase

Look for `strategy/knowledge-base.md` (NOT the example file at `strategy/examples/knowledge-base.md`).

**If `strategy/knowledge-base.md` does NOT exist:**

Tell the user:

> Your GTM context is not set up yet. The first step is building your master knowledgebase -- one document that captures your positioning, ICP, personas, voice rules, and competitive landscape. Everything else in this system derives from it.
>
> Run `/setup-strategy` and I will walk you through it interactively. Or start manually with `strategy/templates/knowledge-base-template.md`.
>
> Check `strategy/examples/knowledge-base.md` for what a completed knowledgebase looks like (fictional B2B SaaS "ComplianceOS").

Do not suggest any other skills until the knowledgebase exists.

### Step 2: Check for derived module files

If `strategy/knowledge-base.md` exists, check whether these derived files exist in `strategy/`:

- `icp.md`
- `personas.md`
- `positioning.md`
- `voice-guide.md`
- `competitive-landscape.md`

**If any derived files are missing:**

Tell the user:

> Your master knowledgebase exists, but the derived module files are missing or incomplete. Run `/sync-context` to generate them. Each skill in this system reads specific module files -- not the full knowledgebase -- so these need to exist before the pipeline works.

### Step 3: System is ready

If the knowledgebase and all derived files exist, tell the user:

> Your GTM context is set up. Here is what you can do:

Then list the available skills (see below) and suggest a starting point:

- If `customer-intelligence/transcripts/` contains files: suggest running `/extract-insights`
- If transcripts are empty but strategy exists: suggest dropping transcripts into `customer-intelligence/transcripts/` or running `/research-brief` to start from strategy alone
- If insights and briefs already exist in `outputs/briefs/`: suggest running `/seo-pipeline`

## Available Skills

### /setup-strategy
Build your master knowledgebase from scratch. Interactive walkthrough that asks about your company, ICP, personas, positioning, voice, and competitive landscape. Produces `strategy/knowledge-base.md` and then derives all module files automatically.

**Context consumed:** Templates only (`strategy/templates/`)
**When to use:** First time setup, or when starting over from scratch.

### /sync-context
Read the master knowledgebase and update all derived module files. Diffs the master against existing modules and updates only what changed.

**Context consumed:** `strategy/knowledge-base.md` --> writes to all derived files
**When to use:** After editing your master knowledgebase. This is how changes cascade through the system.

### /extract-insights
Analyze sales call transcripts using the Grow & Convert pain-point SEO methodology. Extracts structured intelligence: jobs-to-be-done, pains with triggers and costs, workflow reality, competitor mentions and sentiment, customer lexicon (exact phrases buyers use), and keyword candidates with priority scoring.

**Context consumed:** `strategy/icp.md`, `strategy/personas.md`, `strategy/competitive-landscape.md`
**When to use:** After dropping transcripts into `customer-intelligence/transcripts/`.

### /research-brief
Generate a prioritized topic backlog and detailed content briefs from extracted intelligence. Briefs include keyword targeting, SERP analysis, audience mapping, section-by-section outlines, value propositions to weave (pain to prop to proof), originality nuggets, and CTA strategy.

**Context consumed:** `strategy/icp.md`, `strategy/personas.md`, `strategy/competitive-landscape.md`, `customer-intelligence/`
**When to use:** After running extract-insights, or when you want to build briefs from your strategy and existing intelligence.

### /seo-pipeline
Six-stage content pipeline that takes a brief through enrichment, outline, writing, editing, internal linking, and publishing. Each stage loads only the context it needs. The pipeline stops at the outline stage for mandatory human review.

**Stages and their context:**

| Stage | Context Consumed |
|-------|-----------------|
| Enrichment | `customer-intelligence/`, `proof-library/` |
| Outline | Enrichment output + original brief |
| Writer | `strategy/voice-guide.md`, `strategy/positioning.md`, approved outline |
| Editor | `strategy/voice-guide.md` |
| Internal Linker | Sitemap / URL inventory |
| Publisher | SEO assets YAML |

**When to use:** After you have a content brief (from /research-brief) and want to produce a finished article.

### /linkedin-insights
Extract LinkedIn post angles from customer intelligence. Maps insights to persona-specific framing using your positioning themes.

**Context consumed:** `strategy/personas.md`, `strategy/positioning.md`
**When to use:** When you want to turn customer intelligence into LinkedIn content angles.

## Context Architecture

### How it works

```
strategy/knowledge-base.md        (one source of truth -- you maintain this)
        |
        | /sync-context
        v
strategy/icp.md                   (derived -- agents consume these)
strategy/personas.md
strategy/positioning.md
strategy/voice-guide.md
strategy/competitive-landscape.md
        |
        | skills read only what they need
        v
extract-insights reads:  icp + personas + competitive
research-brief reads:    icp + personas + competitive + customer-intelligence/
seo-pipeline reads:      varies by stage (see table above)
linkedin-insights reads: personas + positioning
```

### The cascade principle

Edit `strategy/knowledge-base.md` --> run `/sync-context` --> derived modules update --> every downstream skill's output changes. You maintain one document. The system distributes the right slices to the right agents.

### Why agents never load the full knowledgebase

Tight context produces better output. When an agent receives only what it needs, it follows instructions more precisely, uses fewer tokens, and drifts less. The research agent does not need voice rules. The editor does not need ICP firmographics. Each skill's context consumption is specified and enforced.

## MCP Integrations (Optional)

These are not required. The core pipeline works with Claude Code and local files only. MCP servers enhance specific skills when connected.

| MCP Server | Enhances | What It Adds |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| Firecrawl | `/research-brief` | SERP crawling, competitor content analysis, gap identification |
| Webflow | `/seo-pipeline` (publisher) | Direct CMS draft creation with FAQ schema and category detection |
| HubSpot | `/research-brief` | Deal and contact data for topic prioritization |
| Clay | `/extract-insights` | Company enrichment from transcript mentions |
| Lemlist | Future outbound motions | Sequence loading from extracted insights |
| GA4 / Analytics | `/research-brief` | Performance feedback loop for topic scoring |

Skills detect MCP availability at runtime. If a server is not connected, the skill runs without it and notes what the integration would add.

## File Conventions

### Output naming
- Content briefs: `outputs/briefs/{topic-slug}-brief.json`
- Enriched briefs: `outputs/briefs/{topic-slug}-enriched.md`
- Outlines: `outputs/briefs/{topic-slug}-outline.md`
- Approved outlines: `outputs/briefs/{topic-slug}-outline-approved.md`
- Articles: `outputs/articles/{topic-slug}.md`
- SEO assets: `outputs/seo-assets/{topic-slug}-seo.yaml`
- LinkedIn posts: `outputs/linkedin/{topic-slug}-linkedin.md`

### Directory conventions
- `strategy/` -- your knowledgebase and derived modules (never put outputs here)
- `strategy/examples/` -- ComplianceOS reference files (read-only, do not overwrite)
- `strategy/templates/` -- blank guided templates (read-only, do not overwrite)
- `customer-intelligence/transcripts/` -- raw transcript files (user-provided)
- `customer-intelligence/examples/` -- sample transcript and outputs (read-only)
- `proof-library/case-studies/` -- your case studies with quantifiable metrics
- `outputs/` -- all pipeline outputs land here, organized by type
- `motions/` -- future GTM motions added with each newsletter issue

### The human review gate

The SEO pipeline stops after the outline stage. The outline must be reviewed and renamed to `*-outline-approved.md` before the pipeline continues to writing. This is deliberate -- human judgment belongs at the strategic inflection point between research and execution. Do not skip this step.

## Rules

- Always check which context files a skill needs before running it. The consumption map above is authoritative.
- Never load more context than a skill requires. If a skill reads `voice-guide.md` and `positioning.md`, do not also load `icp.md`.
- The human review gate at the outline stage is mandatory. Do not skip it. Do not auto-approve outlines.
- Customer anonymization applies during writing, not after. The writer stage anonymizes company names and individual names from transcript-sourced evidence. Do not include identifiable customer information in published output.
- When running sync-context, diff the master against existing derived files and update only what changed. Do not regenerate unchanged modules.
- Example files in `strategy/examples/` and `customer-intelligence/examples/` are reference material. Do not overwrite them with user data.
- Prohibited terms in written output: "game-changer", "revolutionary", "cutting-edge", "next-generation", "best-in-class", "world-class", "leverage" (as a verb), "synergy", "paradigm shift", "disruptive", "bleeding edge", "robust" (when used as filler), "seamless" (when used as filler), "holistic", "end-to-end" (when used as filler). If these appear in source material quotes, they may be kept in direct attribution only.
