# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to AI coding agents, including Codex and Claude Code, when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

pptx-glimpse is a TypeScript library that converts PPTX slides to SVG / PNG.
Input: `Uint8Array` (Node.js `Buffer` is accepted as a subclass), Output: SVG string or PNG `Uint8Array`.

## Commands

```bash
npm run build          # Build with tsup (CJS + ESM + .d.ts)
npm run test           # Run all tests with vitest
npm run test -- packages/renderer/src/utils/emu.test.ts  # Run a single test file
npm run test:watch     # Watch mode for tests
npm run lint           # ESLint check
npm run lint:fix       # ESLint auto-fix
npm run format         # Prettier formatting
npm run format:check   # Prettier check
npm run typecheck      # Type check with tsc --noEmit
npm run render         # Test rendering with tsx scripts/test-render.ts
npm run inspect        # Inspect PPTX internal XML (e.g., npm run inspect -- file.pptx slide1)
npm run dev -- file.pptx  # Live preview dev server (auto-reload on packages/*/src/ changes)
```

CI consists of 6 jobs:

- **lint**: `knip` → `lint` → `format:check` → `typecheck` (Node 22 only, runs once)
- **test**: `test` with coverage → `build` → package verification (Node 22/24/26)
- **playwright**: Browser E2E tests and demo production verification (Node 22/24/26)
- **vrt**: Snapshot VRT (Docker-based, self-comparison)
- **libreoffice-vrt**: LibreOffice VRT for renderer regressions (generates fixtures and reference images via Docker)
- **editor-validity**: LibreOffice validity checks for editing API output (shares the libreoffice-vrt Docker image, runs independently from renderer VRT)

## Architecture

Read [`docs/architecture/overview.md`](docs/architecture/overview.md) before changing package
responsibilities, workspace dependencies, public/private package status, build entries,
externalization/bundling, the document-to-renderer adapter, or Node/browser boundaries. Update
the overview in the same change when one of those boundaries changes.

The working summary is: **PPTX binary → PptxSourceModel → computed view → core adapter →
private renderer → SVG → optional PNG**. `@pptx-glimpse/document` is the lower-level OOXML
foundation; `@pptx-glimpse/editor` builds on it; public `pptx-glimpse` orchestrates document,
editor, and rendering behavior; the demo/UI consumes public packages. Lower layers must not
depend on higher layers.

Read [`docs/editor-error-contract.md`](docs/editor-error-contract.md) before adding or changing
editor operations, operation failure codes, high-level editor error wrapping, warning transport,
or read/render/write catches in `PptxEditorSession`.

Before changing PptxSourceModel, computed-view, writer, or adapter behavior, also read the
module-level comments in `packages/document/src/source/pptx-source-model.ts`,
`packages/document/src/computed/pptx-computed-view.ts`,
`packages/document/src/writer/write-pptx.ts`, and
`packages/core/src/pptx-computed-view-renderer-adapter.ts`.

When adding or changing a `@pptx-glimpse/document` reader, computed view, from-scratch writer, existing-element edit, or round-trip preservation capability, update `packages/document/docs/feature-support.md` in the same change. Base every `S` entry on a public root API and an implementation test; use `△`, `P`, or `—` when support is constrained, preservation-only, or unverified, and keep the linked constraints/evidence current.

Read [`docs/development/type-assertions.md`](docs/development/type-assertions.md) before
adding or changing a type assertion, an `unsafe*Assertion` helper, parser/external boundary
narrowing, a branded constructor, or the ESLint assertion rules. Update the policy when the
allowed exceptions or enforcement changes; update its dated audit snapshot only when running
a deliberate assertion audit.

## Technical Constraints

- **SVG uses inline attributes only** — No CSS classes. resvg and librsvg do not correctly interpret CSS
- **`isArray` configuration in fast-xml-parser is required** — Tags such as `sp`, `pic`, `p`, `r` must be returned as arrays even for single elements (`ARRAY_TAGS` in `xml-parser.ts`)
- **EMU units & branded types** — PPTX internal coordinates use EMU (English Metric Units). Convert with `emuToPixels()`. A 16:9 slide is 9144000×5143500 EMU = 960×540 px. Model fields use branded types (`Emu`, `Pt`, `HundredthPt` in `packages/renderer/src/utils/unit-types.ts`) to prevent unit confusion at compile time. Use `asEmu()`, `asPt()`, `asHundredthPt()` to create branded values from raw numbers
- **Background fallback** — Backgrounds are resolved in order: slide → slide layout → slide master

## VRT (Visual Regression Testing)

Visual regression tests for rendering output. When modifying the parser or renderer, **always check whether VRT updates are needed**.

```

### Snapshot VRT (Docker-based)

Snapshots are generated inside a Docker container (Node.js + sharp + fonts) to ensure consistent rendering across macOS and Linux. Both snapshot generation and CI test execution use the same Docker image.

Snapshot VRT uses `vrt/snapshot/render-options.ts` to build a small deterministic
font directory from pinned real font files. The script downloads source fonts into a
temp cache, verifies their SHA256 hashes, subsets them to the glyphs used by the VRT
fixtures, and passes only those subset fonts with `skipSystemFonts: true`. This keeps
local runs from scanning and parsing every system font on macOS while still rendering
readable Latin/CJK glyphs in standard snapshot VRT. The Docker image still fixes the
runtime and rendering toolchain; the VRT intentionally does not depend on each
developer machine's full OS font inventory.

#### Setup

```bash
npm run vrt:snapshot:docker-build   # Build the Docker image
npm run vrt:snapshot:update          # Generate fixtures + snapshots (Docker required)
npm run vrt:snapshot:update -- shapes text  # Regenerate only the named VRT cases
```

### VRT Update Procedure

When changes to the parser, renderer, or model affect rendering output:

1. **Update fixtures** (if adding new features or modifying existing fixtures): Edit the appropriate `vrt/snapshot/fixtures-src/*.ts` domain creator module and run `npm run vrt:snapshot:update`
2. **Update snapshots**: `npm run vrt:snapshot:update` regenerates both fixtures and snapshots in Docker. To update only specific cases, pass the `vrt/snapshot/vrt-cases.ts` `name` values, e.g. `npm run vrt:snapshot:update -- shapes text`.
3. **Verify tests**: Confirm VRT tests pass in CI after pushing

### 3 Locations That Must Stay in Sync

When adding a new rendering feature, **all 3 of the following** must be updated:

1. **`vrt/snapshot/vrt-cases.ts`** — Add a new entry to the `VRT_CASES` array
2. **`vrt/snapshot/fixtures-src/*.ts` + `vrt/snapshot/create-fixtures.ts`** — Add a fixture creator function to the appropriate domain module, export it through that module's creator map, and ensure the map is included in `FIXTURE_CREATORS`
3. **`vrt/snapshot/snapshots/`** — Regenerate snapshots with `npm run vrt:snapshot:update`

`VRT_CASES` is the single source of truth shared by both `create-fixtures.ts` and `regression.test.ts`. If a case is added to `VRT_CASES` without a corresponding creator exported from `fixtures-src/` and included in `FIXTURE_CREATORS`, the fixture generation script will fail with an error.

**Common mistake**: Modifying the parser or renderer but forgetting to update snapshots, causing VRT tests to fail. Always run `npm run vrt:snapshot:update` after making changes that affect rendering.

### LibreOffice VRT (Docker-based)

Renders PPTX files generated with python-pptx using LibreOffice and compares them against pptx-glimpse output. Docker ensures a consistent environment.

#### Setup

```bash
npm run vrt:lo:docker-build   # Build the Docker image
npm run vrt:lo:update          # Generate fixtures + reference images (Docker required)
npm run test                   # Run tests (including LibreOffice VRT)
```

#### Tolerance

- `PIXEL_THRESHOLD = 0.3` (per-pixel color difference tolerance)
- Each test case has an explicit `tolerance` set to its measured mismatch rate in CI × 1.2, rounded up to 0.1pt (minimum 0.3%). Measured values are printed as `[lo-vrt]` log lines during test runs — use the CI job logs to recalibrate when LibreOffice or runner fonts change
- `MISMATCH_TOLERANCE = 0.02` is the fallback for newly added cases before calibration

Since LibreOffice ≠ PowerPoint, differences in font rendering and anti-aliasing are tolerated. The goal is to detect rendering regressions, omissions, and structural errors.

#### Without Docker

LibreOffice VRT tests are automatically skipped in environments without Docker. `npm run test` will pass without issues.

### Editor Validity Tests (Docker-based)

`vrt/editor-validity/` is layer 3 of the editor test strategy (LibreOffice validity): it applies editing API operations to source fixtures, renders both the edited output and an expected fixture with LibreOffice, and compares them. It is separate from the renderer regression VRT above — renderer changes affect `vrt/libreoffice/`, document/editing changes affect `vrt/editor-validity/` — and CI runs them as independent jobs sharing the same Docker image.

```bash
npm run vrt:lo:docker-build              # Build the Docker image (shared with LibreOffice VRT)
npm run vrt:editor-validity:fixtures     # Generate fixtures (Docker required)
npm run test                             # Run tests (including editor validity)
```

Fixtures are source / expected PPTX pairs generated by `vrt/editor-validity/create_fixtures.py`. There are no committed snapshots; both sides are rendered at test time. Tests are automatically skipped without Docker or fixtures.

## Release Workflow (Changesets)

This project uses [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) for version management and releases.

### Adding a changeset

When a PR includes changes that affect the published package (bug fixes, new features, breaking changes), run `npx changeset` before committing and select the appropriate version bump type (patch / minor / major) with a summary of the change. This creates a markdown file in `.changeset/` that should be committed with the PR.

Changes that do NOT require a changeset: docs-only updates, CI config, test-only changes, refactoring with no public API impact.

### Release flow

1. PR with changeset is merged to main
2. `release.yml` (changesets/action) automatically creates a "Version Packages" PR that bumps `package.json` and updates `CHANGELOG.md`
3. "Version Packages" PR is reviewed and merged
4. `release.yml` runs `npx changeset publish` — creates a `v{version}` tag and publishes to npm with provenance (Trusted Publishing)

## Coding Conventions

- Prettier: double quotes, semicolons, trailing commas, printWidth 100
- ESLint: unused variables with `_` prefix are allowed
- ESM (`"type": "module"`) — imports require `.js` extension
- Tests are colocated with source files (`packages/core/src/converter.test.ts`, etc.)
