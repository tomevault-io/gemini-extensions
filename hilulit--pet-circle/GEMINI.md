# Pet Circle -- User Story Map

Last updated: 2026-03-17 (Phase 2 in progress -- Firebase Auth + Firestore pets + Firestore subcollections)

## Update Protocol

After completing work on any user story listed below:
1. Change its status to reflect the new state (DONE / PARTIAL / MISSING)
2. Update the counts in the Summary section
3. Move resolved PARTIAL items to the DONE section
4. Add any newly discovered gaps to the appropriate section

## App Architecture

Two app-level roles: **Owner** and **Vet** (selected at sign-in).
Per-pet sharing via care circle with three roles:
- **Admin**: Pet creator. Full control (edit, delete, manage circle, measure).
- **Member**: Invited family/sitter. Can measure, view, add notes. Cannot edit pet or manage circle.
- **Viewer**: Typically the vet. Can view everything, add clinical notes. Cannot measure or edit.

Permissions enforced via `CareCircleRole` enum with `CareCirclePermissions` extension in `lib/models/care_circle_member.dart`.

Global active pet tracked in `petStore.activePetIndex` -- shared across all screens via header pet switcher.

## Status: Phase 2 IN PROGRESS

### Done in Phase 2
- Firebase Auth enabled (`kEnableFirebase = true`)
- Firestore user profiles via `UserService`
- Firestore pet persistence via `PetService` (create, delete, care circle management)
- `PetStore` streams pets from Firestore via `subscribeForUser(uid)`
- Measurements, notes, and medications stream from Firestore subcollections
- Pet edit persistence via `PetService.updatePet()`
- Parent `Pet.latestMeasurement` stays in sync with measurement subcollection writes
- User thresholds and preference toggles persist via Firestore-backed `settingsStore`
- In-app notifications persist via Firestore-backed `notificationStore`
- Dual-layer role architecture (App-Level: vet/owner + Care Circle: admin/member/viewer)
- Invitation flow with deep link acceptance
- Permission enforcement across all screens

### Remaining in Phase 2
- Push notifications via FCM
- Deploy repo-managed Firestore security rules
- Harden invitation acceptance so strict rules do not need a self-join exception

## Status: FUTURE (Phase 3-5)

| Phase | Stories |
|-------|---------|
| 3 | VisionRR camera measurement, trend anomaly detection, automated SRR alerts, measurement reminders, vet-to-owner messaging |
| 4 | PDF report generation, CSV file export (actual file), shareable health summaries, vet clinic analytics |
| 5 | Apple Watch / WearOS companion, offline mode with sync |
