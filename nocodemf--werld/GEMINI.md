> This is **not** a simulation of the human world. It is a computational ecosystem where autonomous agents evolve their own ways of being. No human-world assumptions are injected: no language, no economy, no society templates. Agents live on an abstract graph, perceive through evolved sensory channels, act through continuous effectors, and communicate through brain-driven broadcasts. Everything — brains, senses, drives, signals, memory, motor patterns, cortex reliance — is evolvable. Natural selection is the only teacher.

# Werld — Project Reference

## Design Philosophy

This is **not** a simulation of the human world. It is a computational ecosystem where autonomous agents evolve their own ways of being. No human-world assumptions are injected: no language, no economy, no society templates. Agents live on an abstract graph, perceive through evolved sensory channels, act through continuous effectors, and communicate through brain-driven broadcasts. Everything — brains, senses, drives, signals, memory, motor patterns, cortex reliance — is evolvable. Natural selection is the only teacher.

The goal is **open-ended evolution**: agents should be able to naturally advance beyond any initial constraints. No part of their cognition is hardcoded. The simulation is designed to run indefinitely on persistent storage.

## Project Overview

A Python simulation of autonomous agents that live, perceive, act, reproduce, and evolve on a graph-based substrate. Agents possess **NEAT-style evolvable neural networks**, an optionally-active associative cortex, episodic memory with evolvable parameters, heritable genomes with evolvable drives and I/O dimensions, evolvable sensory processing (64 channels including 19 latent slots), continuous motor effectors with evolvable broadcast bandwidth (up to 16 channels), and the ability to discover compound motor patterns with genome-gated thresholds.

The **Werld Observatory** is a Next.js dashboard providing real-time god-like analysis with 13 sections (Welcome, Methods, Overview, Story, World Map, Population, Evolution, Brain, Intelligence, Ecology, Resources, Communication, Agents), a story generator, world map visualization, pervasive tooltips, and a simulation uptime timer.

The simulation is written in **pure Python** (no ML frameworks). The dashboard is **Next.js / React / TypeScript** with **Recharts** and **shadcn/ui**, reading from the same SQLite database.

## Simulation Engine (Python)

### Graph Topology (Substrate)

The world is a **Watts-Strogatz small-world graph**. No grid, no Cartesian coordinates.

| Parameter | Config Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Nodes | `SUBSTRATE_NUM_NODES` | 800 | Total resource nodes |
| Avg Degree | `SUBSTRATE_AVG_DEGREE` | 4 | Avg connections per node |
| Rewire Prob | `SUBSTRATE_REWIRE_PROB` | 0.15 | Shortcut probability |

Each `GraphNode` has: `id`, `energy`, `neighbors` (list of connected node IDs), `pheromone` (float), `vis_x`/`vis_y` (for dashboard visualization).

**Pheromones**: Agents leave chemical traces on visited nodes. Pheromones decay at `PHEROMONE_DECAY_RATE` per tick, capped at `PHEROMONE_MAX`. Deposit rate is optionally proportional to agent energy fraction.

**Seasons**: Energy regeneration fluctuates sinusoidally with period `SEASON_PERIOD` (200 ticks) and amplitude `SEASON_AMPLITUDE` (0.6). Creates periodic environmental pressure.

### Agent Architecture

Each `Agent` combines six subsystems:

#### 1. Genome (`agents/genome.py`)

Three-part heritable blueprint:

**a) Traits** — Flat numeric vector governing physical capacities, behavioral drives, and cognitive architecture (29 total):
- Physical: `tick_cost`, `max_energy`, `entropy_resistance`, `sense_range`, `signal_range`, `signal_width`
- Learning: `learning_rate`, `exploration_factor`, `mutation_rate`, `knowledge_transfer`, `cortex_capacity`, `memory_capacity`
- Behavioral: `fork_threshold`, `macro_discovery_rate`, `cultural_transfer`
- **Evolvable drives** (Phase A): `harvest_drive`, `maintain_drive`, `explore_drive`, `social_drive` (signed: negative=aggression, positive=cooperation), `reproduce_drive`, `signal_drive`
- **Evolvable I/O** (Phase F): `broadcast_width` (1-16, how many broadcast channels are active)
- **Evolvable cortex** (Phase F): `cortex_reliance` (0-1, probability cortex fires when brain is active), `cortex_resolution` (2-6, bins per perceptual dimension in state hash)
- **Evolvable memory** (Phase F): `memory_decay` (0.80-0.99, importance decay per tick), `memory_social_weight` (0-2, social presence importance boost)
- **Evolvable macros** (Phase F): `macro_capacity` (5-50, max compound actions), `macro_pattern_length` (2-8, max length of discovered patterns)

Integer traits (rounded after mutation/crossover): `signal_width`, `cortex_capacity`, `memory_capacity`, `sense_range`, `signal_range`, `broadcast_width`, `cortex_resolution`, `macro_capacity`, `macro_pattern_length`

**b) NEAT topology** — Node genes + connection genes with global innovation numbers:
- `NodeGene`: id, type (input/hidden/output), bias, activation function (tanh/relu/sigmoid/identity/sin/abs/step)
- `ConnectionGene`: innovation number, from_node, to_node, weight, enabled flag
- Crossover aligns genes by innovation number (NEAT-style)
- Mutations: add connection, add node (splits connection), mutate weight, toggle connection, mutate bias, mutate activation

**c) Evolvable sensory processing** (Phase B):
- `sensory_gains`: per-channel gain multiplier (core channels default 1.0, latent channels default 0.01; range [0.01, 5])
- `sensory_offsets`: per-channel offset (default 0.0, range [-2, 2])
- Applied to raw sensory inputs: `processed = raw * gain + offset`
- Mutations via gaussian perturbation (30% per-channel probability for gains, 20% for offsets)

**Crossover**: On reproduction, both parents contribute. For traits: randomly inherit each from either parent. For NEAT: gene-by-gene alignment by innovation number (matching genes randomly chosen, excess/disjoint from fitter parent). For sensory genes: uniform crossover per channel.

**Mutation**: All three parts mutate independently. Traits clamp to configured ranges. NEAT topology grows through structural mutations. Sensory gains/offsets undergo gaussian perturbation.

#### 2. AgentState (`agents/state.py`)

Mutable runtime state:
- `energy` (float), `entropy` (float), `age` (int), `node_id` (int), `alive` (bool)
- `signal_buffer`: received signal vectors (list of float lists, variable length per sender's broadcast_width)
- `last_action`, `last_action_result`
- `tick_upkeep()`: deducts `tick_cost` + brain metabolic cost from energy, accumulates entropy

#### 3. Cortex (`agents/cortex.py`)

Fast associative weight table — a secondary/fallback reflex system:
- Maps `(state_hash, action_id)` → weight
- State hash computed from: energy bucket, entropy bucket, local energy, agents nearby, node degree, signal count
- **Evolvable resolution** (Phase F): `cortex_resolution` trait controls how many bins per perceptual dimension (2-6). Higher resolution = finer discrimination but slower generalisation and more memory.
- **Evolvable reliance** (Phase F): `cortex_reliance` trait (0-1) controls the probability the cortex fires when the brain is active. Agents can evolve `cortex_reliance → 0.0` to become pure NEAT-brain creatures, or keep it high for reflex backup. Evolution decides.
- Action selection via **genome-driven drive modulation** + exploration noise + softmax
- **Evolvable internal drives** (Phase A): instead of hardcoded behavioral biases, drive modulation uses genome traits (`harvest_drive`, `maintain_drive`, etc.)
- Bounded by `cortex_capacity` (LRU eviction when full)
- Experience-based reinforcement: weight updates based on drive-before/drive-after delta
- Inheritance: child cortex inherits fraction of parental weights via `cultural_transfer` trait

#### 4. NEATBrain (`reasoning/neat_brain.py`)

Evolvable topology neural network (NEAT-style):
- **No gradient descent**. Weights evolve through natural selection and mutation.
- Network topology grows/shrinks through NEAT structural mutations.
- Supports recurrent connections (hidden→hidden) for working memory.
- Activation functions per node: tanh, relu, sigmoid, identity, sin, abs, step.
- Forward pass uses topological sort with cycle handling for recurrent connections.
- `metabolic_cost` = `num_active_nodes × NEURON_COST` + `num_active_connections × CONNECTION_COST` + `sensory_excess × SENSORY_COST` + `active_broadcast_channels × BROADCAST_COST`
  - `sensory_excess` = sum of `|gain - 1.0|` across all sensory channels
  - `active_broadcast_channels` = genome trait `broadcast_width` (only active channels cost energy)
- This cost is deducted from energy each tick, creating selection pressure against unnecessary complexity and unused broadcast bandwidth.
- `compute_reward()` is **vestigial** — returns 0.0. The NEAT brain evolves through natural selection, not reward signals.

#### 5. EpisodicMemory (`agents/memory.py`)

Bounded, importance-based memory with evolvable parameters:
- Stores `Episode` objects (tick, action, node_id, energy/entropy deltas, agents_present)
- **Evolvable decay** (Phase F): `memory_decay` trait (0.80-0.99) replaces the fixed `MEMORY_IMPORTANCE_DECAY` constant. Each species evolves its own forgetting rate.
- **Evolvable social weight** (Phase F): `memory_social_weight` trait (0-2) controls how much social presence boosts an episode's importance. Social species evolve high social_weight; solitary species may evolve it toward 0.
- Importance = `|drive_delta| + social_weight × (1 if agents_present else 0)`
- `narrative_summary()` for potential future integration

#### 6. Motor Patterns / Compound Actions (`systems/evolution.py`)

Self-discovered action sequences with genome-gated thresholds:
- `SequenceTracker` bins continuous effector values into coarse buckets and tracks patterns
- **Evolvable pattern length** (Phase F): `macro_pattern_length` trait (2-8) controls the maximum length of detected sequences. Replaces the fixed `MAX_COMPOUND_LENGTH`.
- **Evolvable capacity** (Phase F): `macro_capacity` trait (5-50) controls the maximum number of compound actions an agent can hold. Replaces the fixed `MAX_COMPOUND_ACTIONS`.
- `macro_discovery_rate` (already evolvable since Phase 3) controls the probability of promoting a candidate.
- `COMPOUND_SUCCESS_THRESHOLD` (3) remains as physics — minimum repetitions needed to confirm a pattern.
- Promoted to `CompoundAction` when consistently beneficial
- Inheritable (with mutation, respecting genome's `macro_pattern_length`) during reproduction
- Represent emergent behavioral complexity — "motor programs"

### Agent Lifecycle: `perceive → decide → act → learn`

Each tick, for each alive agent:

1. **`tick_upkeep()`**: Deduct tick_cost + brain metabolic cost from energy, accumulate entropy
2. **`perceive()`**: BFS within `sense_range` hops — collects 64-dimensional sensory vector (45 core + 19 latent)
3. **`decide()`**: NEAT brain produces continuous effector outputs (23 values: 7 motor + 16 broadcast); cortex fires with probability `cortex_reliance` (fallback if no brain)
4. **`interpret_effectors()`**: Physics engine translates continuous effector activations into world effects
5. **`learn()`**: Cortex reinforces based on drive delta; brain records experience count; episodic memory stores episode (with evolvable social_weight); sequence tracker checks for motor pattern discovery (with genome-gated capacity/length)

### Sensory Inputs (64 channels)

| Range | Category | Channels |
|-------|----------|----------|
| 0-12 | Proprioceptive | Energy deficit, entropy pressure, age, energy ratio, entropy ratio, brain nodes/connections, hidden activations ×3, energy/entropy deltas, compound count |
| 13-22 | Exteroceptive | Local energy, best/avg neighbor energy, node degree, agents at/near node, agents 1-hop, hub detection, movement edges, 2nd-hop energy |
| 23-32 | Social | Signal count, 4 signal channel averages, kin presence, unique senders (approx), last action flags (harvest/move/maintain) |
| 33-35 | Pheromone | Local, best neighbor, avg neighbor pheromone |
| 36-40 | Environmental/Temporal | Season sin/cos, season regen multiplier, circadian clock, last action type |
| 41-44 | Stochastic/Utility | Constant bias (1.0), uniform noise, gaussian noise, age-modulated pulse |
| **45-48** | **Effector Echo** | Last tick's locomotion dir/intensity, harvest, social (proprioceptive motor feedback) |
| **49-52** | **Broadcast Echo** | Last tick's broadcast channels 0-3 (self-monitoring of own signals) |
| **53-56** | **Derivative Signals** | Rate of change: d(energy)/dt, d(entropy)/dt, d(local_energy)/dt, d(population)/dt |
| **57-60** | **Cross-Products** | energy×entropy, local_energy×agents_nearby, pheromone×season, age×entropy |
| **61-63** | **Memory Aggregates** | Avg recent drive_delta, action variety (diversity of recent actions), memory fullness ratio |

Channels 45-63 are **latent**: their sensory gains initialize at 0.01 (near-zero), making them dormant until evolution discovers their value by evolving the gain away from 0. This is how agents expand their sensory field without changing the brain's I/O dimensionality.

Raw features are processed through evolvable `sensory_gains` and `sensory_offsets` before reaching the brain.

### Effector Outputs (23 channels)

| Idx | Effector | Type | Description |
|-----|----------|------|-------------|
| 0 | Locomotion direction | Continuous | Signed value mapped to neighbor index |
| 1 | Locomotion intensity | 0-1 | Movement commitment |
| 2 | Harvest intensity | 0-1 | Energy extraction from current node |
| 3 | Social interaction | Signed | Negative = attack, positive = transfer |
| 4 | Maintenance intensity | 0-1 | Self-repair |
| 5 | Reproduction intensity | 0-1 | Above `FORK_INTENSITY_THRESHOLD` = fork |
| 6 | Signal intensity | 0-1 | Above threshold = broadcast |
| **7-22** | **Broadcast channels** | **Continuous** | **Up to 16 evolved signal content channels (agent uses `broadcast_width` of them; rest zeroed)** |

"Observe" and "idle" are gone — perception is automatic, idle is the absence of effector activation. Multiple effectors can fire simultaneously. The `interpret_effectors()` function in `systems/actions.py` translates these into world effects.

**Evolvable broadcast bandwidth** (Phase F): Each agent's genome trait `broadcast_width` (1-16) controls how many of the 16 broadcast channels are active. Channels beyond `broadcast_width` are zeroed in both the brain output and signal propagation. Metabolic cost is proportional to active channels only (`BROADCAST_COST × broadcast_width`), creating selection pressure against unused bandwidth.

### Systems

- **Actions** (`systems/actions.py`): `interpret_effectors()` converts continuous effector outputs into world effects. Respects `broadcast_width` when constructing signal vectors. Legacy `execute_action()` dispatch is kept for backward compatibility.
- **Signals** (`systems/signals.py`): BFS propagation within `signal_range` hops. When `UNSTRUCTURED_COMMS=True`, signal content comes from the brain's broadcast channels (evolved, not hardcoded). Signal vector length varies per sender (determined by `broadcast_width`).
- **Forking** (`systems/forking.py`): Reproduction — energy cost, genome crossover/mutation (traits + NEAT topology + sensory genes), cortex/brain inheritance with evolvable transfer strength, drive weights, cortex resolution. Macro inheritance respects child's `macro_capacity` and `macro_pattern_length`.
- **Evolution** (`systems/evolution.py`): Motor pattern discovery from binned effector activation sequences. `discover_compound_actions` accepts `max_capacity` from genome. `mutate_compound_action` accepts `max_length` from genome. Patterns are inheritable and mutable.
- **Entropy** (`systems/entropy.py`): Entropy accumulation and lethal threshold mechanics.

### Story Generation (`persistence/story.py`)

Every `STORY_CHAPTER_EVERY` ticks (default: **10,000**), the simulation generates a plain-English narrative chapter summarising what happened during that epoch. Chapters cover:

- Population changes (births, deaths, net growth)
- Generational progress (max generation, average age)
- Energy and survival (health assessment, substrate energy)
- Brain complexity (neuron/connection counts, metabolic cost, growth trends)
- Species diversity (how many species, diversification status)
- Learning and innovation (cortex size, new motor patterns discovered)
- Communication (signal deliveries, active broadcasters)
- Closing outlook (trajectory assessment)

Chapters are stored in the `story_chapters` table and displayed in the Story dashboard section.

The `save_substrate_topology()` function stores the graph layout (node positions, edges) in `simulation_meta` for the World Map visualization. Called once at simulation start and checkpoint restore.

### Persistence

**SQLite** (`persistence/db.py`, `persistence/event_log.py`):
- Tables: `simulation_meta`, `events`, `lineage`, `snapshots`, `population_stats`, `comms_stats`, `species_stats`, `brain_stats`, `story_chapters`
- `brain_decision` events store `{"effectors": [7 floats], "continuous": true}` instead of action IDs
- DB compaction (`prune_old_data`) runs every `DB_PRUNE_EVERY` ticks, deleting old `signal_sent` and `brain_decision` events, keeping last `DB_PRUNE_AFTER_TICKS` ticks of full detail

**Checkpoints** (`persistence/state_store.py`):
- Gzipped JSON with full simulation state (substrate, agents, tick, innovation counter, pheromone data)
- Rotating checkpoints (keep last `CHECKPOINT_KEEP`)
- **Milestone checkpoints** every `MILESTONE_EVERY` ticks (never deleted)
- Resume via `--resume` or `--checkpoint <path>`

### Indefinite Running Infrastructure

- **SIGTERM handler**: Saves checkpoint on graceful shutdown
- **Watchdog mode** (`--watchdog`): Auto-restart on crash
- **Extinction safeguard**: Auto-spawns mutants when population drops to 1 (`EXTINCTION_SAFEGUARD`). Safeguard spawns happen **before** logging, so all births/deaths are properly counted in statistics.
- **Dead agent purging**: Removes long-dead agents from memory every `DEAD_AGENT_PURGE_EVERY` ticks
- **DB compaction**: Prunes old events to prevent unbounded DB growth
- **Simulation start time**: Stored in `simulation_meta` (key: `simulation_start_time`) as an ISO timestamp. Used by the dashboard uptime timer.

### Configuration (`config.py`)

All parameters centralized. Key sections:
- Substrate: topology, energy regen, pheromones, seasons
- Genome: 29 trait ranges (min, max, default) including 6 evolvable drives, evolvable I/O, cortex, memory, and macro params
- Action costs and thresholds (continuous system)
- NEAT brain: mutation probabilities, weight ranges, speciation, metabolic costs
- Unstructured comms: 16 max broadcast channels
- Persistence: DB pruning, checkpoints, milestones
- Indefinite running: extinction safeguard, dead agent purging

## Evolutionary Design: What is Evolvable vs Fixed

### Fully Evolvable (natural selection decides)
- Brain topology (neurons, connections, activation functions)
- Brain weights and biases
- Sensory processing (per-channel gain and offset for all 64 channels)
- Sensory field expansion (latent channels 45-63 with dormant gains)
- Internal drives (how much to weight each behavioral impulse)
- All 29 genome traits (via crossover + mutation)
- Motor patterns (compound action discovery + inheritance)
- Motor pattern capacity and maximum pattern length
- Communication content (brain-driven broadcast channels)
- Communication bandwidth (broadcast_width: 1-16 active channels)
- Cortex reliance (whether to use reflex system or go pure brain)
- Cortex perceptual resolution (how finely to bin the world)
- Memory decay rate (how fast memories fade)
- Memory social weighting (how much social encounters matter)

### Fixed by Physics (the "laws of nature")
- Graph topology (the substrate doesn't change)
- Energy regeneration mechanics and seasonal cycles
- Entropy accumulation and lethality
- Pheromone decay rates
- Action costs (energy price of each effector)
- Fork mechanics (energy cost, parent contribution)
- Signal propagation range
- Perception range in hops
- `COMPOUND_SUCCESS_THRESHOLD` (3 repetitions needed to confirm a pattern — physics of learning)

### Deliberately Absent
- Reward function (vestigial, returns 0.0 — evolution is the teacher)
- Hardcoded behavioral biases (replaced by evolvable drives)
- Hardcoded sensory normalizations (replaced by evolvable gains/offsets)
- Discrete named actions (replaced by continuous effectors)
- Fixed cortex reliance (now genome-gated)
- Fixed memory parameters (now genome-driven)
- Fixed macro thresholds (now genome-driven)
- Fixed broadcast bandwidth (now evolvable)
- Language, economy, social structures (must emerge, not be injected)

## Running the Project

### Simulation
```bash
cd /path/to/world_v2
python main.py                          # Fresh run (indefinite)
python main.py --seed 42 --ticks 10000  # Seeded, limited run
python main.py --resume                 # Resume from latest checkpoint
python main.py --no-brain               # Cortex-only mode
python main.py --watchdog               # Auto-restart on crash
```

### Dashboard
```bash
cd /path/to/world_v2/dashboard
npm install
npm run dev                             # Starts on http://localhost:3000
# Or for production:
npm run build && npm start              # Production build on http://localhost:3000
```

The dashboard reads SQLite from `../data/simulation.db` relative to the dashboard directory.

## Known Issues & Historical Context

1. **Grid → Graph Migration**: Originally used a 2D grid (`pos_x`, `pos_y`). Migrated to Watts-Strogatz graph (`node_id`). Old checkpoints are incompatible.

2. **NativeBrain → NEAT Migration**: The original `NativeBrain` (fixed-topology, backprop-trained) in `reasoning/brain.py` has been replaced by `NEATBrain` (evolvable topology, evolution-trained) in `reasoning/neat_brain.py`. The old file is kept but no longer used.

3. **Discrete Actions → Continuous Effectors**: The 12 discrete named actions (move_0–3, harvest, transfer, signal, maintain, fork, observe, idle, attack) have been replaced by 7 continuous effector channels + up to 16 broadcast channels. Legacy action IDs are still used internally for cortex reinforcement and motor pattern tracking.

4. **Reward System Retired**: `compute_reward()` in `neat_brain.py` is a vestigial stub returning 0.0. The NEAT brain evolves through natural selection (survival → reproduction), not through reward signals.

5. **Hardcoded Biases Removed**: Cortex drive modulation is now genome-driven (Phase A). Sensory normalization is now evolvable (Phase B). Signal content is now brain-driven (Phase 5). Cortex reliance, memory parameters, and macro thresholds are all genome-driven (Phase F). The system has zero hardcoded behavioral assumptions.

6. **DB TTL**: The dashboard's SQLite connection has a 10-second TTL to prevent stale data when the simulation restarts or the DB is replaced.

7. **Checkpoint Compatibility**: `from_checkpoint` includes backward compatibility handling for old formats but structural changes (grid→graph, NativeBrain→NEAT, 45→64 sensory inputs, 11→23 outputs) make truly old checkpoints unusable. Sensory gains/offsets are padded on load (latent channels get 0.01 gain). Always restart from a compatible checkpoint.

8. **Latent Sensory Channels**: Channels 45-63 start with gain 0.01 (effectively dormant). Evolution can "discover" them by evolving the gain higher. This allows sensory field expansion without breaking NEAT crossover (all agents have the same I/O dimensionality).

9. **Extinction Safeguard Ordering**: Safeguard spawns (when population drops to 1) now happen **before** logging, so all births/deaths including safeguard-spawned agents are properly counted in `total_births`/`total_deaths` statistics. Previously, safeguard spawns after logging caused misleading dashboard numbers.
