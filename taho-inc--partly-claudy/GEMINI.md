# partly-claudy — agent guide

Terminal UI for the Claude status page (Statuspage v2 API). Single binary,
async tokio + ratatui 0.30. Read this before making non-trivial changes.

## Architecture

```
src/main.rs     CLI parsing (clap) → ratatui::init() → run() → ratatui::restore()
src/api.rs      Statuspage v2 DTOs + Source { Live, Fixture } async fetch_summary()
src/bars.rs     compute(components, incidents, today) → Vec<UptimeRow> for 90-day bars
src/events.rs   EventLoop spawns 3 tokio tasks (input / render tick / refresh)
                merges into mpsc<AppEvent> { Key, Tick, Resize, Loaded, LoadFailed }
src/app.rs      App state + handle(AppEvent) reducer (no I/O), Pane { Services, Incidents }
src/theme.rs    AppTheme — pinned + embedded + opaline + ~/.taho/themes/ discovery
src/ui/mod.rs   render(frame, &mut app) — header / banner / body / footer + modal
src/ui/*.rs     header, banner, services (dot+name+bars+pct+meta per row),
                timeline (Incidents), modal, footer, help, theme_picker, scroll, skeleton
themes/*.toml   embedded Opaline themes (TAHO + Claude Code variants)
```

The reducer in [src/app.rs](src/app.rs) is pure: no I/O, no async. All
network/disk work is in [src/events.rs](src/events.rs), which posts results
back through the channel as `AppEvent::Loaded(Box<Summary>)` or
`AppEvent::LoadFailed(String)`. UI state lives entirely on `App`.

## Key crates

- **ratatui 0.30** — `ratatui::init()` / `ratatui::restore()` for terminal
  lifecycle. `Layout::vertical(...)` / `Layout::horizontal(...)` for splits.
  `.right_aligned()` / `.left_aligned()` on `Paragraph` (do not use the
  renamed `HorizontalAlignment` directly).
- **tui-overlay 0.1** — `Overlay::new().anchor(Anchor::Center).slide(Slide::Top)`
  for the detail modal, with an `OverlayState` on `App`. Render order:
  main UI first, then `frame.render_stateful_widget(overlay, area, &mut state)`,
  then read `state.inner_area()` and render the modal body into it. Tick
  the state every frame from `App::handle(AppEvent::Tick)`. Modal opens
  on Enter, closes on Esc.
- **tui-skeleton 0.3** — used by [src/ui/skeleton.rs](src/ui/skeleton.rs).
  `SkeletonBlock` for solid + braille panels (uptime bar uses
  `.braille(true)`). `SkeletonStreamingText` for incident bullet rows
  (typewriter fill, `repeat(true)` keeps it cycling). `elapsed_ms`
  comes from `App::loading_elapsed_ms()` which rewinds to
  `refresh_started_at` on manual refresh — stream replays from frame 0.
- **opaline 0.4** — token-based theme engine. Themes in
  [themes/](themes/) are `include_str!`'d at compile time. Discovery
  walks `~/.taho/themes/` so user themes are shared with taho-admin.
  Selection persists to `~/.taho/partly-claudy/settings.toml`. Tokens
  resolved via `AppTheme` (`bg`, `panel_bg`, `text`, `muted`, `dim`,
  `accent`, `success`, `warning`, `danger`, `info`). **Do not** hardcode
  `Color::Red`/`Color::Green` — go through `AppTheme`.

## Adding a new pane / widget

1. Add a file under `src/ui/`. Pattern: `pub fn render(frame, area, app)`.
2. If the widget needs focus, add a variant to `Pane` in
   [src/app.rs](src/app.rs) and include it in `cycle_focus`'s order.
3. Use [`services::pane_block`](src/ui/services.rs) for the chrome —
   it bundles the rounded border, focus-dependent border color, and
   the `pane_title` leader. Add right-aligned context with
   `.title_top(Line::from(...).right_aligned())`.
4. Borrow colors from `AppTheme` — never hardcode RGB.
5. If the widget shows live data, render a bespoke skeleton when
   `app.is_loading()`. See `skeleton::render_services` /
   `render_incidents` — generic shimmer is anti-pattern; reproduce
   the loaded shape so the layout doesn't reflow on first data.
6. For scroll affordance, use [`scroll::overlay`](src/ui/scroll.rs)
   after `render_stateful_widget` — read `ListState::offset()` to
   detect items above/below the visible window. Reserve a 1-cell
   gutter on the right so indicators don't clobber content.

## Adding a new event source

All async work happens in [src/events.rs](src/events.rs). Spawn another
tokio task in `EventLoop::new`, add a variant to `AppEvent`, and handle
it in `App::handle`. Keep the reducer pure.

## Refresh & loading state

- `r` key in main view fires `events.refresh_now()` and calls
  `app.begin_refresh()` (which sets `refreshing = true`,
  stamps `refresh_started_at`, toasts "refreshing..."). Gated on
  `!app.modal_open()` so it doesn't fire under help/theme picker/modal.
- `Loaded` and `LoadFailed` clear `refreshing`. On `LoadFailed` the prior
  data stays visible — `refreshing` flips false but `summary` is preserved.
- `is_loading()` returns true during initial load (no summary) **and**
  during in-flight refresh — skeleton replays in both states.
- The Services pane height is sized via `services::SKELETON_ROWS` (= 6,
  the typical Statuspage tenant) when `is_loading()`, so the skeleton has
  vertical room before the first fetch returns.

## Statuspage API

See [docs/statuspage-api.md](docs/statuspage-api.md) for the API surface,
uptime math, and fetch strategy.

## Testing

CI ([.github/workflows/ci.yml](.github/workflows/ci.yml)) runs the same
gate locally: `cargo fmt --check` → `cargo clippy --all-targets --
-D warnings` → `cargo test`. All three must pass on push to main and
on every PR.

- `cargo check` — fast, run after every change.
- `cargo fmt --check` — must be clean (CI gate; rustfmt with default
  config). Run `cargo fmt` to fix.
- `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings` — must be clean.
- `cargo test` — 15 tests across `bars::compute`, `services::cells_for_width`,
  and banner rendering against a fixture.
- `cargo run -- --fixture tests/fixtures/summary.json` — end-to-end manual
  test without network.

Prefer tests against `bars::compute` and DTO deserializers — pure
functions over data.

## Conventions

- Edition 2024, MSRV 1.86 (set by tui-overlay).
- No emojis in code or commits unless explicitly requested.
- Default to writing no comments — explain WHY only when it's
  non-obvious.
- DTO modules can use `#![allow(dead_code)]` for fields we deserialize but
  don't currently render. Other modules should not.
- Keep the reducer free of I/O; if you need data, dispatch an event.

## Living docs

- `features/*.feature` — Gherkin behavior specs (not executed).
- `README.md` — user-facing install / usage / bindings. Plain language,
  no implementation jargon, no em-dashes.
- [docs/statuspage-api.md](docs/statuspage-api.md) — Statuspage data
  model + fetch strategy.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `LICENSE-MIT`, `LICENSE-APACHE`
  — FOSS surface. Copyright held by TAHO Inc; dual licensed MIT OR
  Apache-2.0.
- `screenshots/` — README assets (hero gif, future demos). Excluded
  from the published crate via `exclude = ["screenshots/*"]` in
  [Cargo.toml](Cargo.toml). Referenced from the README through the
  `raw.githubusercontent.com/taho-inc/partly-claudy/main/screenshots/`
  URL form — that hotlinks; `/blob/main/` does not. Note: crates.io's
  HTML sanitizer strips `<video>` tags and renders only the first
  frame of any GIF, so anything more dynamic than a still image only
  animates on GitHub.
- [.github/workflows/ci.yml](.github/workflows/ci.yml) — GitHub Actions
  CI: fmt + clippy + test on Ubuntu stable. README has Crates.io and
  CI badges; both go green once the workflow runs and `cargo publish`
  lands the crate.

## Current Focus

In rest state. The Statuspage-mirror milestone is closed; the UI and
theme system have settled into the patterns below; the project ships
with a complete FOSS surface (licenses, contributing, code of conduct,
screenshot, CI). Published as `partly-claudy v0.1.0` on crates.io,
tagged `v0.1.0` on `origin/main`. Pick from the next-up candidates
when starting a new arc.

### FOSS attribution rules

- Visible TAHO Engineering credit lives in two surfaces: bottom of the
  in-app help modal ([src/ui/help.rs](src/ui/help.rs)) and the README
  footer. Don't add more — repetition dilutes.
- Copyright on both license files is `TAHO Inc` (not a personal name).
- README is the user front door. Implementation details (file paths,
  crate names, network mechanics, build commands beyond install/run)
  belong in [docs/statuspage-api.md](docs/statuspage-api.md) or
  [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md), not here.

### Crystallized invariants

- Skeletons mirror loaded layouts. New panes follow this — generic
  shimmers are anti-pattern. See [src/ui/skeleton.rs](src/ui/skeleton.rs).
- `services::pane_block` is the single entry point for pane chrome
  (rounded border + focused/unfocused style + `pane_title` leader).
- Theme tokens flow through [`AppTheme`](src/theme.rs) accessors;
  raw `Color::Red`/`Color::Green` are forbidden.
- Picker preview is debounced (`PREVIEW_DEBOUNCE`) — cursor and
  applied diverge during a quiet window. Anything that mutates the
  active theme outside the picker should still go through
  `AppTheme::commit_preview` so persistence stays consistent.
- The reducer in [src/app.rs](src/app.rs) is pure. I/O lives in
  [src/events.rs](src/events.rs).
- Loading state is `summary.is_none() || refreshing`. The `r` key
  promotes via `App::begin_refresh`, which rewinds skeleton timing.
- When `overlay.is_open()`, arrow keys + hjkl are no-ops in
  [src/app.rs::handle_key](src/app.rs). The detail modal absorbs
  movement so the underlying selection stays put while the user reads.
  Esc / q / ? / r / Tab still work through the overlay.
- The bar-row cursor in [src/ui/services.rs::render_bar_row](src/ui/services.rs)
  highlights exactly one cell — the leftmost cell mapping to
  `app.bars_day`. The stretch math in `cells_for_width` gives
  individual days 1-2 cells of bar width when `area.width` doesn't
  divide evenly by 90; reversing all matching cells would produce
  inconsistent 1-2 cell cursor widths.

### Next-up candidates

- Open the selected incident's `shortlink` in a browser via `o` (adds
  the `open` crate; cross-platform spawn).
- Memoize older history months across refreshes — they don't change.
  Re-fetching every 60s burns ~125 detail requests against a public
  endpoint with no rate-limit headers.
- Filter incidents by name (`/`) — needs an input widget; help screen
  has no hint for it yet.
- Theme sync with taho-admin: point at `~/.taho/settings.toml` instead
  of `~/.taho/partly-claudy/settings.toml`. Requires a missing-name
  fallback since the two apps' theme sets differ.
