# mfsk-core — agent notes

Repo-level notes for assistants working in this tree. Anything specific to
a sub-crate lives in its own `CLAUDE.md` or `README.md`; this file is for
cross-crate workflow that's easy to forget between sessions.

## Embedded targets

The active production crates are `embedded-poc/m5stack-s3-app/` (S3
LX7, repositioned as **demo / acoustic-fallback** in the 2026-05-17
pivot — the StickS3 board can't do USB host),
`embedded-poc/m5stack-core2-app/` (Core2 LX6, wav_sim only — no USB
peripheral on classic ESP32), and `embedded-poc/m5stack-cores3-app/`
(S3 LX7, **main UAC controller target** — CoreS3 has AXP2101 +
AW9523B for proper USB-OTG host mode). Phase 0-Core (board bring-up)
and Phase 1-Core (UAC host code) both shipped 2026-05-23; what's
still open is Phase 1-Verify — live IC-705 hardware confirmation,
tracked as issue #163 and, as of this writing, the single blocker for
the rest of the Phase B-Core sequence (see `docs/notes/ROADMAP.md`
Phase B-Core for the live status). `m5stack-s3-app` and
`m5stack-core2-app` each have their own `CLAUDE.md` covering
board-specific bring-up; `m5stack-cores3-app` does not yet — read
`docs/notes/ROADMAP.md` Phase B-Core for its status instead. This
section captures the shared workflow that's easy to forget between
sessions.

**WSPR embedded RX (Phase E, issue #260) is a separate track from the
FT8-controller line above** — it never goes through `decode_block` or
the UAC/controller stack, so it isn't blocked on #163 the way Phase
B-Core is (both share #163 only for live audio capture; everything
else already works against WAV-fed/synthetic baseband). Lives in the
same `m5stack-cores3-app` crate as two separate binaries:
`src/bin/wspr_bench.rs` (timing measurement) and `src/bin/wspr_app.rs`
(the standalone receiver — LCD spot list, WiFi, HTTP config, NTP, and
real UAC audio through `AudioSink`). Note that `wspr_app` *does* now
share `uac.rs` with the FT8 line, so it shares #163 for that path too
— open items in #313. See `docs/reference/EMBEDDED.md`'s "WSPR on
embedded" section and `docs/notes/ROADMAP.md` Phase E for status.

- **Build & flash via `espflash`**, not host cargo. Both crates'
  `.cargo/config.toml` set `runner = "espflash flash --monitor"`, so the
  basic user workflow is:
  ```sh
  cd embedded-poc/m5stack-s3-app   # or m5stack-core2-app
  cargo run --release              # builds + flashes + opens serial monitor
  ```
  In practice, for capturing per-session logs to a file, use
  `embedded-poc/scripts/flash-monitor.sh` (see next section) instead of
  the bare runner.
- The `+esp` Rust toolchain (Xtensa fork, espup-installed) is selected
  by each crate's `rust-toolchain.toml`. Target triple per
  `.cargo/config.toml`: `xtensa-esp32-espidf` for Core2 (LX6),
  `xtensa-esp32s3-espidf` for S3 (LX7).
- `cargo check` from inside each crate validates code changes without
  flashing (~30-50 s with prebuilt esp-idf).
- Logs from the device land in `embedded-poc/<crate>/logs/` — user has
  been capturing per-session sweep output there.
- The user actively flashes both boards during embedded work; do NOT
  assume "host check is enough" when changing `src/main.rs` or anything
  that affects the runtime path. Offer to flash and capture a new log.
- The compute-bench crate `embedded-poc/m5stack-s3/` still exists for
  S3-only decoder timing sweeps. The Core2 bench (`m5stack-core2/`) was
  retired in `#61` Phase 3 — `m5stack-core2-app` covers the same
  wav_sim decode path in a production-app shape.

## Capturing logs from a flashed device (ESP32 / S3)

Use `embedded-poc/scripts/flash-monitor.sh` — **never** roll your own
`espflash flash --monitor` + redirect, and never `cat /dev/ttyACM0`. Two
foot-guns this script avoids:

1. `espflash monitor` defaults to `--before default-reset`, which pulses
   DTR/RTS and on S3 USB-OTG boards drops the chip into DOWNLOAD mode
   (`rst:0x15 USB_UART_CHIP_RESET … waiting for download`). The script
   passes `--before no-reset --after no-reset` so the just-flashed app
   keeps running.
2. Re-flashing the same ELF prints "Segment … has not changed, skipping
   write" and finishes in ~5 s. **That is not a successful flash** — the
   chip still runs the previous binary. Touch a source file or change a
   `log::info!` line to force a real rewrite, and expect ~15-25 s for a
   real factory-partition write.

```sh
source ~/export-esp.sh
cd embedded-poc/m5stack-s3-app   # or m5stack-s3, m5stack-core2-app
cargo build --release --bin <bin>
../scripts/flash-monitor.sh \
    target/<triple>/release/<bin> \
    logs/<bin>_<tag>_$(date +%Y-%m-%d).log \
    90    # capture seconds (optional, default 90; use ≥120 for fresh Core2 flashes — 1.3 MB binary takes ~55 s to write)
```

## Test fixture paths

Never hardcode absolute paths like `/home/ubuntu/...` or `/Users/...`
for test inputs. AI assistants tend to "fix" path failures by
translating to whichever local environment they happen to run in
(commit `119657a` flipped `/home/minoru/` → `/home/ubuntu/`), which
just relocates the bug.

- **In-repo assets**: use the `asset_path!` macro from
  `mfsk-core/tests/common/mod.rs` (integration tests) or
  `concat!(env!("CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR"), "/../embedded-poc/assets/<f>")`
  (unit tests under `src/`). Vendor the file under
  `embedded-poc/assets/` if it's not already there — the FT8 / JT9
  reference recordings already live there.
- **Out-of-tree user-machine assets** (e.g. the full WSJT-X tarball):
  `option_env!("WSJTX_SAMPLES_DIR")` and skip cleanly when unset.
- **Diagnostic output paths** (test writes a WAV for human inspection):
  `/tmp/...` literals are fine — the human-in-the-loop step assumes a
  known location. Don't replace these with `tempfile`.

## Running tests — pick the tier, never blanket `--ignored`

`CONTRIBUTING.md` "Testing philosophy" defines the four tiers (A
invariants / B golden fidelity / C sensitivity / D deleted). This
section is the operational half: which command to actually type.

**The merge gate — use this by default.** Every non-ignored test
across every protocol, i.e. tiers A + B. ~90 s on a Ryzen 9 9900X.
This is exactly what CI's `Test (default)` job runs:

```sh
MFSK_REQUIRE_CORPUS=1 cargo test -p mfsk-core --features full,internal-testing --release
```

`MFSK_REQUIRE_CORPUS=1` turns a missing golden recording into a
failure instead of a silent skip. Set it locally too — without it a
mis-resolved asset path reports green (that is exactly how five
protocols' golden tests skipped unnoticed before the recordings were
vendored).

**Iterating on one protocol**: scope with `--test`, don't reach for
`--ignored`.

```sh
cargo test -p mfsk-core --features full,internal-testing --release --test ft8_qso3_full_parity_recall -- --nocapture
```

**The trap: a blanket `-- --ignored` locally escalates into tier C.**

```sh
# DON'T — this is a sensitivity measurement campaign, not a check.
cargo test -p mfsk-core --features full,internal-testing --release -- --ignored
```

`--ignored` with no `--test` scope runs *every* `#[ignore]`d function
in the crate, which includes the tier-C sensitivity sweeps
(`fst4_sweep`, `ft8_sweep`, `jt9_sweep`, `jt65_sweep`, `wspr_sweep`,
`q65_*_sweep`, …). Those are the ones that consume the ~17 GB
generated corpora under `embedded-poc/assets/*_sweep/`. **On CI they
silently skip** — the corpora aren't there, and most of those
binaries aren't in any CI glob anyway — so the command looks harmless
in `ci.yml` and is not harmless here. `fst4_sweep` **alone** had not
finished after 35 minutes when it was killed (2026-08-12), and it is
one of a dozen such binaries.

CI does run some `--ignored` suites, but always scoped per binary
(`--test q65_ap_sweep --test q65_snr_sweep … -- --ignored`) and
push-only. If you want a specific ignored test, name its binary the
same way.

**Tier C** belongs to two moments only: before a release tag, and
after a change that plausibly moves sensitivity. It has its own
runner, which checks the corpora are present up front instead of
producing a wall of silent skips:

```sh
scripts/run-sensitivity-sweeps.sh              # everything present
scripts/run-sensitivity-sweeps.sh ft4 fst4     # or just what moved
```

**"Plausibly moves sensitivity" means the code path, not the
protocol name.** Before running a protocol's sweep, check it actually
shares the code you touched. FT8's `decode_block::coarse_sync` /
`SYNC_LAG_S` is FT8-only — FST4 reaches sync through
`engine::sync::coarse_sync` + `engine::sync2d::fst4_sync_search`, so
an FT8 coarse-sync change cannot move an FST4 curve and running that
sweep buys nothing (issue #280, where this was learned the expensive
way).

**Other feature sets.** `fixed-point` is the numeric path embedded
ships and is worth a second run whenever you touch the decode
pipeline — it reorders candidates through `SpecCell = u16`
quantisation, so it can diverge from host f32 on the same fixture:

```sh
cargo test -p mfsk-core --features full,fixed-point --release --test ft8_qso3_apoff_recall
```

`wspr-ddc` and `wspr-ddc-cascade` are the WSPR embedded channelizer
swaps (`wspr::ddc`'s single-stage and two-stage-cascade streaming
down-converters, replacing the host-default whole-slot FFT
`decimate_to_baseband`) — mutually exclusive (`compile_error!` in
`decode_scan_inner` if both are on), each with its own real-signal
golden test against the WSJT-X recording, worth a run whenever
`wspr::ddc` changes:

```sh
MFSK_REQUIRE_CORPUS=1 cargo test -p mfsk-core --features full,internal-testing,wspr-ddc-cascade --release --test wspr_wsjtx_samples wspr_cascade_ddc_golden_recall_and_precision
```

**`internal-testing` is not optional for whole-crate commands.**
`cargo clippy --all-targets --features full` (without it) reports
`E0603` private-item errors in `fst4_sweep` / `ft4_sweep` /
`fst4_wsjtx_samples` — those tests reach into crate internals. That is
a missing feature flag, not a regression you introduced; use the
pre-commit hook's own invocation
(`--workspace --all-targets --features full,internal-testing`) before
concluding anything is broken.

## Releases — go through CD, never `cargo publish` locally

`mfsk-core` ships to crates.io via `.github/workflows/release.yml`,
triggered by a `vX.Y.Z` tag push. The workflow gates the publish on
the CI for the same commit going green (`wait-for-ci` job), then
runs `cargo publish -p mfsk-core --features full` + builds the
`mfsk-ffi-ft8` FFI artifacts + creates the GitHub release with
attached tarballs.

`wait-for-ci` checks two things, not one. The workflow-run poll
tolerates `skipped` (a docs-only push legitimately skips the build
matrix), which is too wide for the job carrying the golden tier-B
assertions — so a second step requires `Test (default)` to have
concluded `success` at *job* granularity. Together with
`MFSK_REQUIRE_CORPUS=1` in `ci.yml`, a green `Test (default)` is a
positive statement that the golden tests ran against real recordings
rather than skipping. Before the recordings were vendored they did
skip, silently, for five protocols.

**Do not `cargo publish` from a local clone.** crates.io publishes
are irreversible — once a version is up, you cannot unpublish
(yank exists but blocks new dependents while existing dependents
keep using the broken version). A local publish bypasses the CI
gate that this whole workflow exists to enforce; even if your
local SHA happens to be CI-green, future releases get sloppier
when "just publish locally" is in the playbook. Push the tag and
let CD do it.

Sequence:
1. Merge release PR into `main`.
2. `git checkout main && git pull`.
3. **Run the tier-C sensitivity sweeps** (see below).
4. `git tag vX.Y.Z <merge-sha>` then `git push origin vX.Y.Z`.
5. Watch the Actions tab for the `Release` workflow.

### Step 3: tier-C sensitivity sweeps, before every tag

```sh
scripts/run-sensitivity-sweeps.sh              # everything present
scripts/run-sensitivity-sweeps.sh ft4 fst4     # or just what moved
```

CI never runs these. They need the generated corpora under
`embedded-poc/assets/*_sweep/` (~17 GB, gitignored, built by
`scripts/gen_*_sweep_wavs.sh` on top of WSJT-X's Fortran simulators),
so on CI every one of them silently skips. A release is the interval
where that gap actually matters — shipping a sensitivity regression to
crates.io is the outcome the sweeps exist to prevent, and it is
irreversible once published.

They **assert nothing** by design: sensitivity is a curve, and a
threshold that moved 0.3 dB is a judgement call rather than a boolean.
The script now diffs itself: every recall-vs-SNR sweep it runs dumps a
per-trial CSV to `target/sweep-csv/`, and at the end it runs
`scripts/sweep-regression-check.py` against those CSVs, which
interpolates each channel's 50%-crossing SNR and prints the delta from
`docs/notes/sweep-baseline.json`, flagging `!!` on any move
`>= 0.5 dB`. This replaced manually eyeballing the printed tables (or
spawning several agents to do it) against `docs/notes/*BENCHMARK.md` —
see `~/.claude/projects/.../memory/project_sensitivity_sweep_pre_release_20260814.md`
for what that used to cost. Still sanity-check the prose in
`docs/notes/*BENCHMARK.md` too — the JSON baseline only tracks
50%-crossing SNR, not e.g. WSPR's phantom-decode count. Once you
understand why a number moved, refresh the baseline with
`python3 scripts/sweep-regression-check.py --update-baseline
target/sweep-csv/*.csv`, and update `docs/notes/BENCHMARKS.md` too if
the reason is one worth recording there (new hardware counts — the
table records the machine).

A nightly workflow was considered and rejected: on a solo, bursty repo
most nights would re-measure unchanged code, and this project already
deleted one scheduled tier for precisely that reason (see `ci.yml`'s
note that it "only ever cost wall-clock for output nobody was
routinely reading").

### Release cadence — biweekly, decoupled from merging

PRs land on `main` immediately as they're ready — CHANGELOG.md's
top (unreleased/latest-numbered) section accumulates entries between
tags, so `main`'s history and the CHANGELOG are always current for
anyone reading the repo directly. **Tagging is separate and
throttled**: established 2026-07-19 after v0.7.0-v0.7.3 shipped in a
4-day burst (see `~/.claude/projects/.../memory/` for the session
that measured this) — that burst wasn't itself a problem (each tag
was a genuinely complete, coherently-scoped unit of work, not an
arbitrary slice; per-tag diff size was comparable to or larger than
historically slower-cadence releases), but four crates.io publishes /
GitHub Releases in four days is more update-notification noise than
downstream consumers want, even when every individual change was
sound.

**Default cadence: every 2 weeks** (max wait 13 days, average 7) from
the last tag, bundling everything merged to `main` since then into
one release PR + tag. Don't tag opportunistically just because a
feature or fix finished — let it sit in the unreleased CHANGELOG
section until the next scheduled cut, *unless* the escape hatch below
applies.

**Escape hatch**: an out-of-cadence tag is fine for a security fix, a
data-loss/correctness bug serious enough to want off the broken
version quickly, or whenever the user explicitly asks for an
immediate release regardless of reason. Cutting early is the user's
call, not something to infer on your own from "this seems important."

**Versioning within this cadence**: a new protocol/mode addition is
patch-level by this crate's own established convention (MSK144
shipped as `0.7.4`, not `0.8.0` — grep `CHANGELOG.md` **and**
`docs/historical/CHANGELOG-0.6-0.7.md`/`CHANGELOG-0.x.md` for prior
protocol additions before assuming otherwise; older releases get
split out of the top-level file periodically to keep it skimmable,
see `CHANGELOG.md`'s own footer for the current archive list).
Minor bumps
(`0.6→0.7`) have historically marked a more structural change (e.g.
`0.7.0`'s generic `decode_frame_for::<P>` API landing alongside FST4's
remaining sub-modes), not simply "a release with new capability in
it" — when genuinely unsure which a given accumulated batch warrants,
ask rather than default to whichever bump feels more exciting.

## Branching — `main` is trunk, `devel` is for open-ended experiments

Established 2026-07-25. Default workflow is unchanged: PRs land on
`main` immediately once they're a complete, coherently-scoped unit
(see release cadence above) — this is what keeps `main` safe for
downstream consumers who git-dependency-pin `branch = "main"` in
their `Cargo.toml`.

`devel` exists as a holding branch for work where the outcome isn't
known yet — embedded bring-up experiments, algorithm changes chasing
a numerical gap (e.g. JT65-style sensitivity work) — anything that
might get reverted rather than merged. Land commits there directly;
once an experiment resolves, PR the result into `main` as usual (or
just let the branch die if it didn't pan out).

If `devel` runs long, periodically merge/rebase `main` into it so it
doesn't rot into an unmergeable state by the time the experiment
concludes.

## Memory

- `~/.claude/projects/-home-minoru-src-mfsk-core/memory/` holds the
  per-conversation auto-memory. `project_decode_block_embedded.md` is the
  authoritative log of the embedded-port performance journey — read it
  before touching `decode_block` or either of the production app crates
  (`m5stack-s3-app`, `m5stack-core2-app`).
