## Project

Static recompilation port of **Dante's Inferno** (Xbox 360) to native PC using
the ReXGlue SDK (v0.10.0). ReXGlue translates PowerPC XEX -> C++ ahead of time.

## Key paths

- `dantes_inferno_manifest.toml` - ReXGlue project manifest (SDK-managed; regen with `rexglue init --force`)
- `generated/rexglue.cmake` - SDK build boilerplate (auto-generated, DO NOT EDIT)
- `generated/default/` - codegen output (gitignored, produced during build)
- `src/dantes_inferno_app.h` - **user-owned** app class; override ReXApp hooks here
- `src/main.cpp` - entry point (SDK-managed, preserved on first init only)
- `game/` - extracted Xbox 360 game files (gitignored, copyrighted - never commit)
- `thirdparty/rexglue-sdk/` - SDK clone (gitignored, via setup.ps1)
- `docs/rexglue_notes.md` - ReXGlue workflow & command reference
- `docs/ultrawide_research.md` - Ultrawide support RE findings & implementation plan
- `tools/asset_tool.py` - asset extraction/packing tool (BIG/STR/TG4D/VP6)
- `tools/ASSET_TOOL_README.md` - asset tool documentation
- `tools/Gibbed.Visceral/` - format reference source (gitignored, Zlib license)

## Build commands (Windows)

```powershell
# One-time: build the rexglue CLI from the SDK
cmake --preset win-amd64-release -DREXSDK_DIR=thirdparty\rexglue-sdk
cmake --build out\build\win-amd64-release --target rexglue

# Regenerate SDK-managed files (requires game/default.xex present)
rexglue init --force --project_name dantes_inferno --project_root . --xex_path game\default.xex --game_root game

# Build the port (codegen runs automatically as a build dependency)
cmake --preset win-amd64-release -DREXSDK_DIR=thirdparty\rexglue-sdk
cmake --build out\build\win-amd64-release
```

Run: `out\win-amd64\Release\dantes_inferno.exe`

## Toolchain

- Clang 18+ required (NOT MSVC/GCC). Detected: Clang 22 at `C:\Program Files\LLVM\bin\clang.exe`
- CMake 3.25+, Ninja, Visual Studio 2022 (Windows SDK for D3D12)
- C++23, D3D12 graphics backend on Windows

## Conventions

- `src/dantes_inferno_app.h` is the ONLY place for custom app behavior. Do not
  edit `main.cpp` or `generated/rexglue.cmake` - they are SDK-managed and get
  overwritten by `rexglue init`/`rexglue migrate`.
- For per-instruction custom C++ injection, use `[[mid_asm_hooks]]` in the
  manifest (see docs/rexglue_notes.md).
- Game assets under `game/` are copyrighted and gitignored. Never commit them.
- The SDK under `thirdparty/rexglue-sdk/` is gitignored; re-clone via `setup.ps1`.

## Naming

Project name `dantes_inferno` -> snake_case `dantes_inferno`, PascalCase
`DantesInferno`, UPPER `DANTESINFERNO`. CMake target: `dantes_inferno`.

## Improvement plan

See `docs/improvements_plan.md` for full research findings. Summary:

1. **Graphics quality** (Phase 1, no RE): resolution_scale, anisotropic_override,
   swap_post_effect=fxaa cvars in OnPreSetup. Optionally FidelityFX FSR build.
2. **Input config** (Phase 2, no RE): SDL backend + MnK keybind defaults in
   OnPreSetup. DualShock/DualSense/Xbox all supported via SDL3.
3. **DLC auto-install** (Phase 3, no RE): OnPostSetup hook scans dlc/ folder,
   calls ContentManager::InstallContent() on each STFS package.
4. **Ultrawide** (Phase 4, requires RE): midasm_hook on projection matrix to
   patch aspect ratio. Hor+ anamorphic render strategy.
5. **Button glyphs** (Phase 5, requires RE): replace game's button prompt
   textures based on active input device. Needs SDK patch for device detection
   or glyph_family cvar. Glyph art in metadata/glyphs/.
6. **Installer** (Phase 6): asks user for ISO + DLC folder, extracts to game/
   and dlc/. No STFS logic in installer.

~~Known blocker: ReXGlue issue #75 — Dante's Inferno crashes at startup due to
unimplemented VMX/Altivec PPC instructions (v0.1.1).~~ **Resolved in v0.10.0.**
Game boots and runs. VMX builder bugs causing FMV corruption were found and
fixed (see `docs/vp6_fmv_corruption_fix.md`).

## SDK patches

The SDK under `thirdparty/rexglue-sdk/` has local patches to
`src/codegen/builders/vector.cpp` that fix VMX instruction builder bugs.
Full technical documentation: `docs/vp6_fmv_corruption_fix.md`.

If the SDK is re-cloned, these patches must be re-applied. The fixes are:

1. **`vpkuwus` / `vpkuhus` in-place aliasing** (root cause of FMV corruption):
   Element-by-element packing loops aliased the destination's narrowed array
   with the source's wider array. Replaced with SSE intrinsics.
2. **`vmsum3fp128` dot product mask** (`0x7F` → `0xEF`): A previous "fix"
   incorrectly changed the mask from `0xEF` to `0x7F`, which excluded PPC
   element 0 (X component) from 3-element dot products instead of excluding
   PPC element 3 (W). This broke physics/collision code, causing the
   character to fall through the map after the opening cutscene. Reverted
   to `0xEF` after the `ppc_tests` test suite caught the regression.
3. **Pack builder `unpackhi_epi64` removal**: Pack builders discarded half
   the packed elements via `unpackhi_epi64`. Removed and operand-swapped for
   byte reversal.

## Build & run notes

- The executable loads `rexgpu-xenos.dll` from its own directory, not from
  the SDK output. After rebuilding the SDK, copy:
  `thirdparty\rexglue-sdk\out\win-amd64\rexgpu-xenos.dll` →
  `out\build\win-amd64-release\rexgpu-xenos.dll`
- Always launch with `--game_data_root=game` from the project root.
- Runtime logs are in `out\build\win-amd64-release\logs\`.
- After changing SDK codegen builders, delete the stale generated files to
  force regeneration. The codegen stamp does NOT track `rexglue.exe` as a
  dependency, so you must delete the stamps AND the generated files, then
  reconfigure CMake and rebuild:
  ```powershell
  Remove-Item generated\default\codegen.* -Force
  Remove-Item generated\default\dantes_inferno_recomp.*.cpp -Force
  Remove-Item generated\default\dantes_inferno_recomp.*.h -Force
  Remove-Item generated\default\sources.cmake -Force
  cmake --preset win-amd64-release -DREXSDK_DIR=thirdparty\rexglue-sdk
  cmake --build out\build\win-amd64-release
  ```
- The SDK's PPC instruction test suite (`ppc_tests`) can be built and run
  to verify codegen builder correctness:
  ```powershell
  cd thirdparty\rexglue-sdk
  cmake --preset win-amd64 -DREXGLUE_BUILD_TESTS=ON
  cmake --build out\build\win-amd64 --target ppc_tests --config Release
  .\out\win-amd64\Release\ppc_tests.exe
  ```

## Save-point crash (in progress)

The game crashes when saving at a save point. Runtime logs show:

1. `Call to unresolved function at guest address 0x82611FB0 (returning)` —
   repeated 5 times. The runtime no-ops on unresolved calls, which leaves
   guest state uninitialized.
2. `Unhandled guest access violation: read of guest 0x000001A4` — the actual
   crash. Address `0x1A4` is a struct member offset from a null pointer,
   a downstream consequence of the unresolved function not setting up state.

**Fix applied (pending rebuild):** Added `0x82611FB0` to
`dantes_inferno_manifest.toml` under `[entrypoint.functions]` so codegen
generates a function stub at that address. The manifest already had nearby
addresses (`0x82611F48`, `0x82611F98`) but was missing `0x82611FB0`.

**Next steps:**
1. Force codegen regeneration (delete `generated/default/codegen.*` and
   `generated/default/dantes_inferno_recomp.*.cpp`).
2. Reconfigure CMake and rebuild.
3. Launch and test save-point again.
4. If it still crashes, check logs for additional unresolved addresses and
   add them to the manifest. The pattern of nearby unresolved addresses
   (`0x82611F48`, `0x82611F98`, `0x82611FB0`) suggests a function table or
   vtable in that region — more entries may be needed.

## Asset extraction tool

`tools/asset_tool.py` extracts and repacks game assets for upscaling. See
`tools/ASSET_TOOL_README.md` for full documentation.

```powershell
# List archive contents
python tools/asset_tool.py list game/bigfile0.viv

# Full pipeline: extract + unpack STR + convert textures to PNG
python tools/asset_tool.py extract game/bigfile0.viv output --full-pipeline

# Extract just videos
python tools/asset_tool.py extract game/bigfile0.viv output --type videos

# Unpack/repack STR files
python tools/asset_tool.py unpack-str input.str output_dir/
python tools/asset_tool.py pack-str input_dir/ output.str

# Convert textures (TG4D <-> DDS/PNG)
python tools/asset_tool.py convert-texture tex.tg4d tex.png --tg4h tex.tg4h
python tools/asset_tool.py make-texture upscaled.png out.tg4d --format dxt5

# Pack BIG archive
python tools/asset_tool.py pack-big input_dir/ output.viv
```

Dependencies: `pip install pillow texture2ddecoder`

Formats supported: BIG/VIV (BIGH), STR (StreamSet), TG4D/TG4H (DXT1/DXT5),
VP6 video, EAGM mesh (raw extraction). RefPack compression/decompression
implemented in pure Python.
