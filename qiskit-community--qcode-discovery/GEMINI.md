## Architecture

The system discovers bivariate bicycle (BB) and perturbed bivariate bicycle (PBB) quantum LDPC codes by evolving Python functions that generate candidate polynomial pairs/tuples, then evaluating them through a multi-stage cascade. Five campaigns discovered 465 distinct codes (97 CSS, 368 non-CSS).

### Evaluation core (`evaluation/`)

- **bb_code.py** — Construct CSS `qldpc.BBCode` from exponent tuples
- **pbb_code.py** — Construct non-CSS PBB codes from 4-tuples (A, B, C, D); C=D=None gives CSS
- **evaluator.py** — 5-stage cascade for CSS: validate → k → quick distance → refined distance → exact distance. `evaluate_candidate()` is the central function. Also has `evaluate_candidate_milp()` for MILP-in-loop
- **distance.py** — BP-OSD distance estimation (CSS codes, OSD_0 and OSD-CS)
- **distance_milp.py** — MILP exact distance: CSS (Hamming weight) and symplectic (non-CSS, binary-OR linearization of per-qubit support) formulations via HiGHS/scipy
- **distance_bposd_noncss.py** — BP-OSD for non-CSS codes with achievable-syndrome sampling (critical: random syndromes fail on non-CSS codes)
- **clifford_equivalence.py** — Check if a non-CSS code is genuinely non-CSS or Clifford-equivalent to CSS
- **mirror_code.py** — Mirror code construction (Khesin & Lu, arXiv:2603.05496)
- **tanner_equivalence.py** — Permutation-equivalence decision via BLISS canonical labeling of the colored Tanner graph (sound + complete for permutation equivalence; not LC / Clifford / general code equivalence). CSS variant (`canonical_hash`) uses 3 colors {qubits, X-checks, Z-checks}; non-CSS variant (`canonical_hash_noncss`) uses 3 colors {qubits, per-stabilizer X-support, per-stabilizer Z-support} with a tying edge between each stabilizer's X-support and Z-support vertices (without the tying edge, BLISS would permit independent permutations of X- and Z-support classes — strictly broader than stabilizer permutation equivalence).
- **results.py** — JSON persistence & Pareto front
- **tracking.py** — JSONL run logging and metrics

FOM = k*d²/n. Trust filter: `DISTANCE_TRUST_RATIO=1.3` and `DISTANCE_UNTRUST_RATIO=2.0` in evaluator.py.

### Evolutionary framework (`evolve/`)

Three campaign families with separate seeds, configs, and evaluators:

| Campaign | Seed | Evaluator | Config | Polynomial type |
|----------|------|-----------|--------|----------------|
| 1-3 (CSS trinomial) | `seed_solution.py` | `openevolve_evaluator.py` | `config.yaml` | 2-tuple (A, B) |
| 4 (CSS mixed-monomial) | `seed_solution_ansatz.py` | `openevolve_evaluator.py` | `config_ansatz.yaml` | 2-tuple (A, B), 4-6 terms |
| 5 (non-CSS PBB) | `seed_solution_noncss.py` | `openevolve_evaluator_noncss.py` | `config_noncss.yaml` | 4-tuple (A, B, C, D) |

- **run_evolution.py**: Entry point. `--noncss` flag auto-selects Campaign 5 config. Supports `--models` for ensemble, `--resume` for checkpoints, `--config`/`--seed` overrides
- **prompt_context.md / prompt_context_ansatz.md / prompt_context_noncss.md**: Domain knowledge fed to LLM for mutations

### Key types

CSS candidates: `list[tuple[int, int]]` — `(x_exp, y_exp)` pairs. A candidate pair is `(A_terms, B_terms)`.
Non-CSS candidates: 4-tuples `(A_terms, B_terms, C_terms, D_terms)` where C, D are perturbation polynomials.
`generate_candidates(ell, m)` returns lists of candidate tuples.

## Domain context

A **bivariate bicycle (BB) code** is a CSS code defined by two polynomials A, B over `F_2[x,y]/(x^ℓ-1, y^m-1)`. Parameters: n=2ℓm physical qubits, k logical qubits (exact via GF(2) rank), d code distance (expensive). CSS commutativity is automatic. The search is purely combinatorial. Campaigns 1-3 used weight-3 trinomials; Campaign 4 extended to 4-6 term mixed-monomial polynomials.

A **perturbed bivariate bicycle (PBB) code** augments BB with two additional polynomials (C, D) creating mixed X/Z stabilizers. When C=D=0, reduces to CSS BB code. The module is `evaluation/pbb_code.py` and uses the paper's stabilizer-matrix convention `H = (A B C D ; 0 0 B^T A^T)` with block-1 z-part `[C | D]` and commutativity `A C^T + B D^T` symmetric.

Four structural families of CSS codes: *univariate/HGP* (A=f(y), B=g(x), highest k but d≤4), *x/y-swap* (A=x^a+y^b+y^c, B=y^d+x^e+x^f, only trinomial family with d≥6), *mixed-monomial* (Campaign 4, terms x^a·y^b), and *non-CSS PBB* (Campaign 5, 4-tuples).

Key structural insight: codes with A=B always have d=2 (proven, Theorem 1 in paper). BP-OSD fails to detect this. MILP verification is essential for high-rate codes (BP-OSD overestimates by up to 12x).

## Known issues and developer gotchas

- **`_poly_to_matrix` bug class (`evaluation/pbb_code.py`):** Must use `sympy.Poly(expr, x, y)`, not a bare sympy expression. qldpc's `eval()` silently produces wrong circulant matrices for multi-term polynomials with bare expressions. Verify by checking that the generated matrix has the expected number of nonzeros per row.
- **qldpc `get_logical_ops()` bugs:** Fails on some non-CSS codes (singular matrix errors). The codebase uses its own `get_symplectic_logicals()` in `evaluation/pbb_code.py` instead.
- **LC equivalence Theorem 3:** The necessity direction ("only if") is false in general — counterexamples exist at (ℓ=2, m=4) with non-uniform S-patterns that achieve CSS but no uniform pattern does. See `paper/theorem3_issues.md` for details. The paper should use "sufficient condition" not "if and only if".
- **`verify_lc_bruteforce` coverage (`evaluation/clifford_equivalence.py:406`):** Tests all 36 uniform per-block Clifford assignments (6×6 over {I, S, H, HS, SH, HSH}). Non-uniform {I,S} and {H,HS} patterns are handled exactly via `verify_uniform_reduction_exact` (GF(2) affine system); non-uniform {SH,HSH} patterns are not exhaustively checked and are the only gap.
- **BP-OSD variance:** A single BP-OSD run is unreliable — estimates can range from 6 to 18 across independent batches on the same code. Publication claims use 150k+ trials (3 decoders × 10 batches × 5,000 trials). BP-OSD overestimates distance by up to 12x for high-rate codes.
- **MILP incumbents:** Some large codes have `milp_incumbent` status (feasible solution found, but not proven optimal). This gives a valid upper bound on d, not exact d. Check `milp_details["exact"]` for authoritative optimality status.
- **Non-CSS BLISS hash requires the tying edge.** When constructing the colored Tanner graph for a non-CSS code, the X-support vertex and Z-support vertex of each stabilizer must be joined by an edge so BLISS preserves the (X-part, Z-part) pairing. Without this edge BLISS permits independent row permutations of the X- and Z-parts (sigma_X != sigma_Z), and the resulting equivalence relation is strictly broader than stabilizer permutation equivalence. The production scripts (`scripts/verify_publication.py`, `scripts/verify_from_scratch.py`) and `evaluation/tanner_equivalence.py` (`canonical_hash_noncss`) all include the tying edge; see the "Non-CSS extension" comment block in `evaluation/tanner_equivalence.py` for the full argument.
