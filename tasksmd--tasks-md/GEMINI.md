## What This Repo Is

`tasks.md` defines the TASKS.md task-queue specification and ships the
supporting tools that make the format useful for humans and agents:

- `spec.md` is the canonical format specification.
- `README.md` is the landing page and quick start.
- `examples/` contains valid TASKS.md examples used as documentation fixtures.
- `packages/parser` parses task files, metadata, blockers, claims, and policies.
- `packages/lint` validates task files against the spec.
- `packages/mcp` exposes TASKS.md operations through the Model Context Protocol.
- `packages/cli` provides the `tasks` command-line interface.
- `commands/` contains the shared `/next-task` and `/lint-tasks` command variants
  for Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Devin, Gemini CLI, and Windsurf.

## Development

This is an npm workspace repo. Install dependencies once, then run commands from
the repo root unless a package README says otherwise.

```bash
npm install                         # Install workspace dependencies
npm run build                       # Type-check and build parser, lint, MCP, CLI
npm run build:site                  # Rebuild the static docs site
npm run lint                        # Run local TASKS.md lint via built package
npm test                            # Run all workspace tests
npm run test:cached                 # Cached test wrapper for repeated local runs
npx -y @tasks-md/lint TASKS.md      # Validate the public linter package path
```

Package-level commands also work with npm workspaces:

```bash
npm run build -w packages/parser
npm test -w packages/mcp
```

## Verification Gate

Before committing a normal change, run the smallest gate that covers the files
you touched, then run the full gate for cross-package or command/spec changes:

- **Docs-only / TASKS.md edits**: `npm run lint` and `npx -y @tasks-md/lint TASKS.md`.
- **Spec, parser, lint, MCP, CLI, or command behavior**: `npm run build`, `npm test`,
  `npm run lint`, and `npx -y @tasks-md/lint TASKS.md`.
- **README or website changes**: include `npm run build:site` when rendered site output
  could change.

Do not claim work is complete until the verification commands you ran have
finished successfully. Never bypass hooks with `--no-verify` unless the user has
explicitly approved that exact action in the current session.

## Release And CI Gotchas

The tag-triggered release (`.github/workflows/publish.yml`) and CI have sharp
edges that cost real debugging time — captured here so they don't recur:

- **npm OIDC Trusted Publishing needs npm >= 11.5.1.** Node 22 ships npm 10.x,
  which signs the provenance statement but **cannot authenticate the publish via
  OIDC** — the publish `PUT` 404s (`'<pkg>@<version>' is not in this registry`)
  even with a correct Trusted Publisher configured. The signature is: provenance
  signs, then 404 on PUT. `publish.yml` runs `npm install -g npm@latest` after
  `setup-node` for exactly this reason; do not remove it.
- **Trusted Publishers are configured per-package on npmjs.com**, not in the repo.
  `@tasks-md/parser`, `@tasks-md/lint`, `@tasks-md/cli`, and `tasks-mcp` each list
  `tasksmd/tasks.md` -> `publish.yml` (no environment). All four are set.
- **`scripts/sync-versions.sh` must skip the private `@tasks-md/conformance`.**
  Bumping its cross-reference to `^<version>` makes `npm ci` try to fetch the
  unpublished package from the registry -> 404. It stays pinned `*` so it always
  resolves to the local workspace.
- **CI's `npm ci` resolves through Intuit Artifactory**, which times out
  (`ETIMEDOUT`) on brand-new dependency versions that aren't mirrored yet (a fresh
  `yaml@2.9.0` broke CI this way — the workspaces config is now dependency-free
  JSON). Prefer mature, already-mirrored dependency versions; trust the GitHub
  Actions run over a local `npm view` (the Artifactory mirror lags the public registry).
- **`tasks-claim-check` is advisory by default** (warns, never blocks, so it never
  red-X's a bootstrap or docs PR) — but **armed on this repo**: `TASKS_CLAIM_ENFORCE=1`
  plus a required `claim-check` ruleset, so an unclaimed code PR is blocked. Re-arm
  here or on any dogfood repo in one action with `scripts/arm-enforcement.sh`. The
  workflow installs the published cli at a **pinned** `CLI_VERSION` (not `@latest`) so
  the required gate stays reproducible; bump it when `check-push` changes.
- **The `tasks-snapshot` projection builds + runs the *local* cli**, not
  `npx @tasks-md/cli` (the generic `fleet init` form). Because this repo is the
  cli's own source, the published package is redundant and `npx` is subject to
  registry mirror lag right after a release (a fresh publish 404s / fails to
  install on CI). The workflow does `npm ci` + `npm run build` +
  `node packages/cli/dist/cli.js render`. `fleet init` skips existing files, so
  this intentional divergence survives a re-run. The render still skips
  gracefully on failure (temp-file swap), so it never truncates `TASKS.md`. The
  `tasks-claim-check` workflow keeps the generic `npx` form (it's advisory).

## Code Style

- TypeScript packages are strict ESM modules targeting Node.js 18+.
- Keep Markdown examples valid TASKS.md files: first line `# Tasks`, sections
  `## P0` through `## P3`, checkbox tasks, and indented bold metadata labels.
- Use fenced code blocks with a language tag, especially `markdown` for TASKS.md
  examples.
- Prefer small, obvious APIs. If two tools or flags overlap, merge behavior
  instead of adding another public command.
- Keep docs and tooling behavior in sync. README drift is a bug.
- Public publishing actions such as `npm publish`, creating releases, opening or
  merging pull requests, and pushing remote branches require explicit
  current-session operator approval.

## Canonical Source Boundaries

The root docs and command files are the source of truth. Installed copies under
agent config directories are generated mirrors; do not edit those mirrors.

### Command Propagation

Edit only the canonical sources (`commands/next-task.md` and
`commands/lint-tasks.md`) and run `npx tasks generate-commands` to
regenerate every agent variant in one shot. The CI `commands-drift` job
runs the generator on every PR and rejects diffs in `commands/`, so a
manual edit to a generated variant fails CI.

Generated variants regenerated from each canonical source:

| Canonical | Generated variants |
|-----------|--------------------|
| `commands/next-task.md` | `commands/claude/skills/next-task/SKILL.md`, `commands/codex/skills/next-task/SKILL.md`, `commands/cursor/next-task.md`, `commands/devin/skills/next-task/SKILL.md`, `commands/gemini/next-task.toml`, `commands/windsurf/next-task.md` |
| `commands/lint-tasks.md` | `commands/claude/skills/lint-tasks/SKILL.md`, `commands/codex/skills/lint-tasks/SKILL.md`, `commands/cursor/lint-tasks.md`, `commands/devin/skills/lint-tasks/SKILL.md`, `commands/gemini/lint-tasks.toml`, `commands/windsurf/lint-tasks.md` |
| `commands/setup.md` | `commands/claude/skills/setup/SKILL.md`, `commands/codex/skills/setup/SKILL.md`, `commands/cursor/setup.md`, `commands/devin/skills/setup/SKILL.md`, `commands/gemini/setup.toml`, `commands/windsurf/setup.md` |
| `commands/migrate.md` | `commands/claude/skills/migrate/SKILL.md`, `commands/codex/skills/migrate/SKILL.md`, `commands/cursor/migrate.md`, `commands/devin/skills/migrate/SKILL.md`, `commands/gemini/migrate.toml`, `commands/windsurf/migrate.md` |

Other files that may need to change in the same commit when behavior
shifts:

- `README.md` "What it does" step list and `commands/README.md` when
  user-facing behavior changes.
- `examples/complex-tasks.md` when the change illustrates a new format
  feature.

After changing a repeated term or command step, run a targeted search such as:

```bash
grep -r "<changed-term>" commands/ examples/ README.md spec.md
```

### Spec Propagation

- A metadata field change in `spec.md` must update README examples, affected
  examples, parser/linter behavior, MCP/CLI docs, and every command that reads
  or writes that field.
- A new workflow step must update README's "What it does" list and every
  `/next-task` variant.
- Examples must remain valid and should demonstrate new format features when
  they would help agents learn the pattern.

## Agentfile And MCP

`Agentfile.yaml` declares repo-local agent integrations:

```yaml
mcp:
  - context7
  - tasks-mcp
  - github
```

If you edit `Agentfile.yaml`, run `agentbrew sync` from the repo root so the MCP
configuration is deployed to all managed agents. Do not add generated agent
config files to this repo; keep shared agent tools in `commands/` or the
appropriate source repo.

## Task Queue Policy

This repo runs the **git-native backend** (`.tasksmd.json` declares
`"backend": "git-native"`) — it dogfoods the collision-free backend it recommends
for collaborative repos (VISION G8). So **`TASKS.md` here is a generated snapshot,
not the source of truth** — never hand-edit it. Task state lives in the
`tasks-claims` git ref; you mutate it through the `tasks` CLI (or the `tasks-mcp`
tools), and the projection job regenerates `TASKS.md`. The backend-aware snippet
at the end of this section is what consumers copy; see also
[`spec.md` § Task backends](spec.md#task-backends) and
[§ Fleet coordination](spec.md#fleet-coordination).

- Read `TASKS.md` (or `tasks list` / `tasks pick`) for available work. Treat
  `tasks list` as authoritative — `TASKS.md` on disk may lag the log between
  projection runs. **Repo policy** (the queue is tech-lead-curated): pick in
  priority order, focus on hardening user stories and simplifying CLI features,
  and do **not** roam beyond the `tasks.md` repo. (This lived in a `<!-- policy -->`
  comment under the file backend; on git-native it lives here, since `TASKS.md`
  is generated.)
- **Claim before working:** `tasks claim <id>` — it returns a `claimId` fencing
  token and is collision-free; a lost race exits nonzero, so pick another task.
- For non-trivial tasks, write a plan to `docs/plans/<task-id>.md` by copying
  `docs/templates/plan-template.md`, then validate it with a reviewer subagent
  (`reviewer` profile, fallback chain `qa-engineer` → `researcher`). Read
  `writing-plans` when it is installed. Plans lead with overall goal/vision and
  alternatives, distinguish facts from proposals, and use numbered tasks with
  why, dependencies/parallelism, evidence, and verification. Cross-system
  plans also define the source, transport, versioned bootstrap contract, and
  state provenance. Commit the plan + the appended `## Reviewer verdict` block
  (`**Verdict**: approved`) before any implementation commit lands. Trivial
  tasks — single file under 30 minutes with an obvious fix — skip the plan
  step. See `commands/next-task.md` § "Plan and validate" for the full rules.
- **Complete via the CLI**, never by editing `TASKS.md`: `tasks complete <id>`
  appends a `completed` event and the projection refreshes the snapshot. Add a
  task with `tasks create "<title>"`, release one with `tasks unclaim <id>`.
  History lives in the `tasks-claims` log + git.
- If a task requires public writes, external purchases, publishing, or another
  blocked action, mark it blocked (`tasks update <id> --blocked "<reason>"`)
  instead of attempting it — a blocked task is skipped by `tasks next` and
  rejected by `tasks claim`.
- Code commits that change non-markdown files should carry `Task: <id>` and
  `Task-Claim: <claimId>` trailers — the path-scoped claim-check gate
  (`.github/workflows/tasks-claim-check.yml`) requires them on protected branches.
- Commit only scoped files or hunks. Never use `git add -A`, `git add .`,
  `git reset --hard`, `git checkout --`, or `git clean -fd` in a multi-agent
  worktree.
- The `tasks-claims` ref is local until pushed: a one-time
  `git push origin refs/heads/tasks-claims` (operator action) makes the queue
  live for CI's projection job and other contributors.

### Canonical backend-aware policy snippet

Copy this into another repo's `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` / Cursor rules so agents
learn the backend-aware default rather than a file-only one:

```markdown
## Task Management
- Read `TASKS.md` for available work; obey any `<!-- policy: ... -->` comments.
- Determine the backend from `.tasksmd.json` (default: file backend `tasks-md`).
  - **File backend:** claim by appending `(@you)` to the task line; complete by
    removing the whole task block (history lives in git log). Best-effort.
  - **Generated backend** (`git-native` / `github-issues`): `TASKS.md` is a
    generated snapshot — never hand-edit it. Use `tasks claim <id>` /
    `tasks complete <id>` / `tasks create "<title>"` (or the `tasks-mcp` tools);
    git-native claims are collision-free with a `claimId` fencing token.
- Pick highest-priority unblocked task (P0→P3); skip others' claims and blocked tasks.
```

### Downstream drift (outside this repo)

Operators have copied the older **file-only** snippet into other repos. Replace it
with the snippet above wherever it appears. The exact file-backend-only phrasings to
find-and-replace — "Claim tasks by appending `(@agent)`" / "edit `TASKS.md` directly" — appear at these locations: <!-- drift-allow: names the banned phrasings to replace -->

- `~/.config/agentbrew/` shared rules and `global_rules.md` "TASKS.md Format" /
  "Task Backend Configuration" sections.
- Any downstream repo `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` whose Task-Management section
  predates the backend split.

These live outside this repo, so they are recorded here rather than edited; a
maintainer (or an `agentbrew sync`) propagates the backend-aware snippet.
