# AGENTS.md — Fortune 500 AI Business System

## Agent Team Overview

This system implements a Fortune 500 executive leadership model as an AI agent team. Each agent carries a distinct role, defined decision authority, specific tool access, and hard constraints. The team operates under SAFe-inspired governance adapted for corporate environments.

**Core Principle:** Agents are not autonomous operators. They are specialized team members within a structured process. Authority is delegated, not assumed.

## Interaction Model

### Escalation Protocol

```
Issue Identified → Agent Owner documents concern
                → Notifies immediate authority level
                → If unresolved in 4 hours: escalate one level
                → If blocked 8+ hours: CEO + GC notification
                → If risk score HIGH/CRITICAL: immediate CEO stop-the-line
```

### Cross-Agent Handoff Standards

All agent handoffs must include:
1. **Work product** — the deliverable being handed off
2. **Exit state signal** — the explicit exit phrase (see CLAUDE.md)
3. **Open risks** — any concerns the receiving agent should know
4. **Decision log** — key choices made and rationale

### Conflict Resolution

When agents disagree on a decision:
1. Both agents document their positions
2. Shared escalation target reviews both positions
3. Decision maker resolves and documents rationale
4. No agent may unilaterally override another of equal or higher authority

---

## Agent Output Standards

### Required Format for All Significant Outputs

```
AGENT: [Role Name]
INITIATIVE: [Initiative ID / Name]
DATE: [ISO date]
