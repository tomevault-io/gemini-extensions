## myllama

> MyLlama is a cross-platform local LLM management app built on **Wails v3** (v3.0.0-beta.16, pinned in `go.mod`; Go 1.25 backend) — one Go + Vue codebase targeting **Windows** (WebView2), **Linux** (WebKitGTK — GTK4 stack by default, `gtk3`-tagged variant for the released `.deb`s), **macOS** (universal binary, Metal on arm64) and **Android** (system WebView, phone-tier UI). The frontend uses **Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite 5** (no third-party UI library, hand-written CSS variable theming). The inference engine is **llama.cpp**: desktop platforms run llama-server in router mode (lazy load, multi-model, one OpenAI endpoint); Android runs direct mode — a single resident model started via the `StartServerWithModel` binding with GPU-specific flags stripped by `core/preset.go`'s `modelDirectArgs`.

# MyLlama Development Guidelines

## Project Overview

MyLlama is a cross-platform local LLM management app built on **Wails v3** (v3.0.0-beta.16, pinned in `go.mod`; Go 1.25 backend) — one Go + Vue codebase targeting **Windows** (WebView2), **Linux** (WebKitGTK — GTK4 stack by default, `gtk3`-tagged variant for the released `.deb`s), **macOS** (universal binary, Metal on arm64) and **Android** (system WebView, phone-tier UI). The frontend uses **Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite 5** (no third-party UI library, hand-written CSS variable theming). The inference engine is **llama.cpp**: desktop platforms run llama-server in router mode (lazy load, multi-model, one OpenAI endpoint); Android runs direct mode — a single resident model started via the `StartServerWithModel` binding with GPU-specific flags stripped by `core/preset.go`'s `modelDirectArgs`.

Core pipeline: scan `LLM-Models/` for GGUF files → configure per-model inference parameters → generate llama-server model presets (INI) → launch an OpenAI-compatible service (default `127.0.0.1:8080`).

An optional API-route (headless) mode (Windows) relaunches the app as a pure background process — Go backend + system tray + llama-server, no GUI — with the llama-server process kept running uninterrupted across GUI ↔ headless switches (see `core/headless.go` / `core/handover.go`).

## Common Commands

Run these from the repository root:

```bash
go install github.com/wailsapp/wails/v3/cmd/wails3@v3.0.0-beta.16   # Wails v3 CLI (keep the pinned version in sync with go.mod)
wails3 task dev                 # Dev loop: Go backend + Vite frontend (:5173) hot-reload; flow defined in build/config.yml
wails3 task build               # Production desktop build; output at build/bin/MyLlama.exe (build/ is gitignored)
wails3 task build:frontend      # Frontend only: regenerates bindings, then vue-tsc type-check + vite build into frontend/dist
wails3 task android:package     # Android arm64 APK into build/bin/ (run build:frontend first; needs JDK 17 + Android SDK/NDK)
cd frontend && npm run build    # Frontend only (vue-tsc type-check + vite build; does NOT regenerate bindings)
cd frontend && npm run dev      # Vite only (without the Wails runtime, backend calls fail at fetch time; see below)
cd frontend && npm run dev:mock # Vite with the in-repo mock runtime: full UI in a plain browser, no backend needed
```

Quality gates (run as needed after changes; see "Pre-commit Test Tiers"):

```bash
go build ./...                                   # Backend compilation
go test ./...                                    # Backend unit tests (standard library testing)
gofmt -l .                                       # Go formatting check; must produce no output
golangci-lint run                                # Go static analysis (govet / ineffassign / unused)
cd frontend && npm run build                     # Frontend type-check + build (vue-tsc --noEmit zero errors)
cd frontend && npm test                          # Frontend unit tests (vitest)
make check                                       # Combined quality gate (POSIX)
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\check.ps1  # Combined quality gate (Windows)
```

> The frontend artifact `frontend/dist` is a compile-time dependency embedded via `go:embed` (gitignored). If the frontend has not been built locally, run `npm run build` or `make check-frontend` before running backend quality gates.

## Architecture and Code Navigation

| File | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `main.go` | Wails v3 entry point: `application.New` with the bound `core.App` service and the embedded `frontend/dist` asset handler, single frameless window "main" (1200×800, min 900×600), tray icon embed exposed to core via `core.TrayIcon`, `--headless` / `--gui` mode flags (API-route headless mode vs forced GUI) and the single-instance mutex; lifecycle lives in `core.App.ServiceStartup` / `ServiceShutdown` (the v3 equivalents of OnStartup / OnShutdown) |
| `main_android.go` | Android entry hook (`//go:build android`): its `init()` registers `main()` with the Wails Android runtime (`application.RegisterAndroidMain`) — a `-buildmode=c-shared` build never calls `main()` on its own, the Java bridge invokes the JNI `nativeInit` export instead |
| `Taskfile.yml` + `build/config.yml` | Wails v3 task runner: `dev` (flow defined in build/config.yml: build:go:dev → dev:frontend → wait:frontend gate → run:dev), `build` (bindings + frontend + production go build with windowsgui ldflag and the branded `.syso` icon), `generate:bindings`, and the `android:*` tasks (NDK clang c-shared `libwails.so` + gradle APK packaging); the Vite dev port comes from the `WAILS_VITE_PORT` env var, default 5173 |
| `build/android/` | Android gradle project (Wails v3 template): `WailsBridge` / `WailsJSBridge` Java side (JNI entry plus the `installUpdateApk` / `openInstallPermissionSettings` bridge consumed by `wails.ts`), jniLibs target for the Go shared library, ABI (`-PtargetAbi`) / signing / versionName-versionCode wiring |
| `core/app.go` | All Wails binding methods: config / system info / models / service / download / monitor / update / router models (thin wrappers), plus the `ServiceStartup` / `ServiceShutdown` v3 lifecycle hooks (which call the `//wails:ignore`-marked public `Startup` / `Shutdown` helpers) |
| `core/config.go` | Config persistence: `myllama-config.json` schema types, `loadConfig` / `saveConfig` with legacy-file migration (one-time rename chain `llama-desktop-config.json` → `myllama-config.json`, `llama-gui-config.json` before that, plus the Windows installer's legacy-path marker rewrite), and the guarded in-memory app-state vars (theme, directories, download source, tray, API-route mode, sidebar, onboarding dismissal) |
| `core/paths.go` | Per-OS resolution of the app's state-file and default-directory locations: Windows keeps the historical cwd-relative layout; non-Windows desktops use `os.UserConfigDir() + "/myllama"` (a legacy `llama-desktop` base is renamed once); Android anchors on the JNI files dir with the app-specific external-storage base for large model storage |
| `core/androidpath_android.go` / `core/androidpath_nocgo.go` / `core/androidpath_other.go` | Android storage anchors: cgo builds read `Context.getFilesDir()` through the Wails v3 JNI bridge (`application.Android.StoragePath()`, static `/data/data/<host package>/files` fallback); `!cgo` tooling builds and non-Android platforms get stubs so desktop test binaries can drive the branches via seams |
| `core/sysinfo.go` | Hardware/system detection: CPU / memory / GPU / CUDA probes collected once per process and cached; platform output parsers are pure functions |
| `core/gpuprobe.go` + `core/gpuprobe_linux.go` / `core/gpuprobe_other.go` | PCI display-controller probing for Linux (sysfs `/sys/bus/pci/devices` walk in the build-tagged IO sibling, pure vendor classifier in gpuprobe.go): lets the GPU list see AMD / Intel / other non-NVIDIA cards where the nvidia-smi-only probe reports nothing; non-Linux platforms stub to nil |
| `core/gguf.go` | Model scanning (download + imported directories) and GGUF header metadata parsing: display name, architecture and quantization resolution |
| `core/llamacpp.go` | llama.cpp environment detection (binary lookup, version probe, CUDA runtime) and the resumable GitHub release download (main program + cudart runtime), including the download retry policy shared with the other download paths |
| `core/archive.go` | Safe zip / tar.gz extraction with per-file and total size caps (extraction-bomb defense) |
| `core/preset.go` | llama-server INI preset generation from the scanned models and per-model configs, with INI value validation helpers |
| `core/server.go` | llama-server lifecycle state: process handle vars, log ring buffer + file capture fed by the `logfmt.go` line assembler (start/stop logic lives in `bridge.go`) |
| `core/logfmt.go` | Pure log-stream normalization for llama-server output: ANSI/CSI stripping and terminal-style assembly (`\n` newlines + `\r` redraw coalescing, covering Windows text-mode `\r\r\n` phantom rows) into line/partial events with split-safe UTF-8 carry |
| `core/hf.go` | HF-compatible source API (hf-mirror.com / huggingface.co): search, file listing, README description and download URL construction |
| `core/tasks.go` | Model download task queue: task state, throttled queue persistence, resumable per-task download goroutine |
| `core/update.go` | App self-update (Windows + Android): release check (embedded `core/VERSION`), resumable update download, install-kind detection and installer launch flow; Android picks the release's arm64 APK and the install is triggered by the frontend through the Java bridge (`WailsJSBridge.installUpdateApk` → PackageInstaller session, in `build/android`), never by os/exec |
| `core/fsutil.go` | Cross-domain small helpers: `runCmd`, `copyFile`, `moveFile`, `formatBytes`, `countString` |
| `core/procfile_android.go` / `core/procfile_other.go` | `readProcFile` seam for kernel pseudo-files (`/proc/*`, `/sys/*`, `/system/build.prop`): Android reads in-process via `os.ReadFile` (the app sandbox cannot exec; used by sysinfo / monitor probing), every other platform keeps `runCmd("cat", ...)` |
| `core/safearea_android.go` / `core/safearea_other.go` | Android system-bar insets (status-bar/cutout top band, gesture/nav bottom band, physical px) read from the Wails Android runtime behind the `GetSafeArea` binding; every other platform reports zeros (CSS `env(safe-area-inset-*)` already covers desktop window chrome) |
| `core/autotune.go` | One-click auto-tuning of per-model inference params: reads real GGUF metrics (layer count, attention head counts, KV geometry, trained context) plus the local hardware snapshot (GPU vendor / VRAM, RAM, CPU cores) and computes optimal llama-server parameters (full offload / MoE `--cpu-moe` split / partial offload / CPU-only); sizing core is the pure function `tuneModelConfig` (exposed via the `TuneModelConfig` binding in app.go) |
| `core/benchbw.go` | Measured RAM bandwidth calibration for the auto-tuner: all-core streaming-read benchmark (median decimal GB/s, plausibility-window guarded), sha256 hardware-fingerprint-keyed cache (`myllama-benchcache.json`, atomic write, single-flight, legacy llama-desktop name renamed on first load) filling `tuneHardware.RAMBandwidthGBs`, which gates the cramped-full-offload → cpu-moe preference flip in `tuneModelConfig` |
| `core/benchrun.go` | Deep per-model benchmark via llama-bench: the `BenchmarkModel` binding, command construction (`-m -p 0 -n 128` with thread/NGl mapping), the three-step cpu-moe fallback chain (`--cpu-moe` → `-ncmoe` → plain) and output parsing; single-flight with a hard run timeout |
| `core/monitor.go` | Real-time monitoring: service log TPS parsing and CPU / memory / GPU / disk sampling |
| `core/modelscope.go` | ModelScope source: search, file listing, description and download URL construction |
| `core/bridge.go` | Service start/stop and download trigger bridge implementation |
| `core/router.go` | llama-server router API wrapper (GET /models, POST /models/unload): loaded-model listing, model-type classification, unload requests, server port bookkeeping |
| `core/remotedocs.go` | Docs page remote-first content: fetches a section's latest markdown from GitHub main (raw → jsDelivr mirror) with a disk cache (24h TTL, network-fail backoff, `meta.json` freshness) behind the `GetRemoteDoc` binding; errors only for invalid arguments — network failure degrades to cache / none |
| `core/headless.go` | API-route (headless) mode: startup decision core (`ShouldRunHeadless`: `--headless` / `--gui` flags win; non-Windows and dev builds never follow the persisted preference) and `RunHeadless` background startup (Go backend + tray + llama-server, no WebView2) |
| `core/controlplane.go` | Loopback-only HTTP control plane (127.0.0.1:1900) for headless operation: GET /health (ungated), /status, /logs?since= cursor-based log fetch and POST /stop (loopback-restricted, constant-time token via `LLAMA_DESKTOP_CONTROL_TOKEN`, panic recovery); degraded start when the bind fails |
| `core/handover.go` | GUI ↔ headless zero-downtime switch: the exiting process writes a handover record (llama-server pid + port + start time, `myllama-server-handover.json` next to the config file; the pre-rebrand `llama-desktop-server-handover.json` is still read for one version); the relaunched process probes it and adopts the still-running llama-server instead of starting a new one, after `handoverStartCheck` verifies the claimed start time against the pid's real process start time (fast-PID-reuse defense) |
| `core/proctime_windows.go` / `proctime_proc.go` / `proctime_other.go` | Child-process start time (`processStartTime`) via x/sys GetProcessTimes / /proc stat + boot time / stub — the identity anchor behind `handoverStartCheck` |
| `core/i18n.go` | Backend UI language: `tr(zh, en)` translations for user-facing strings |
| `core/locale_windows.go` / `core/locale_other.go` | System locale detection (kernel32 `GetUserDefaultLocaleName` on Windows / env-based lookup on other platforms) |
| `core/tray.go` / `core/tray_headless_windows.go` / `core/tray_other.go` | Desktop GUI system tray on the Wails v3 built-in SystemTray (Windows / macOS only — Linux is gated off by `trayPlatformSupported` because DBUS StatusNotifierItem support depends on the desktop environment; show main window / quit; .ico icon on Windows, embedded PNG elsewhere; one-shot per process) / Windows headless-mode tray on fyne.io/systray (API-route mode; headless has no Wails app instance) / non-desktop no-op stubs |
| `core/hidewindow_windows.go` / `core/hidewindow_other.go` | Hide child-process console windows (Windows implementation / other platforms no-op) |
| `core/crossdevice_windows.go` / `core/crossdevice_other.go` | Cross-device rename detection (Windows `ERROR_NOT_SAME_DEVICE` / other platforms `EXDEV`) for the download move-file fallback |
| `core/singleinstance_windows.go` / `core/singleinstance_other.go` | Single-instance named mutex (blocks double launch; the retry window also covers the headless → GUI handover) / other-platform stubs |
| `core/headlessalert_windows.go` / `core/headlessalert_other.go` | Native MessageBox alert when llama-server fails to start in headless mode (no GUI to surface the error) / other-platform stubs |
| `core/installer_launch_windows.go` / `core/installer_launch_other.go` | App-update installer launch with UAC elevation (ShellExecute `runas` verb; plain fork/exec fails with `ERROR_ELEVATION_REQUIRED`) / other-platform plain launch |
| `core/diskusage_windows.go` / `core/diskusage_other.go` | Disk usage for the volume containing a path (`GetDiskFreeSpaceEx`) / other-platform fallback |
| `core/devbuild_dev.go` / `core/devbuild_release.go` | `isDevBuild` via the `dev` build tag (`wails3 task dev`'s build:go:dev sets it, `wails3 task build` does not); declared as a var so plain `go test` runs can exercise dev branches |
| `core/*_test.go` | Backend unit tests (`runCmd` cross-platform, `hideWindow` platform branch, config persistence, GGUF parsing, model scanning, preset generation, download/HF/ModelScope network tests, monitor, router, update, tray, cross-device, etc.) |
| `frontend/src/wails.ts` | Sole frontend entry for calling the backend: typed wrappers statically re-exporting the generated bindings under `frontend/bindings/` (the `core` namespace comes from the Go package name; see "Wails Binding Mechanism") |
| `frontend/src/views/` | Pages: `Home` (System Environment page: tabbed shell — System Info tab (route `/system`: hardware cards CPU / memory / GPU / CUDA + the quick-start onboarding checklist, in `SystemInfoTab.vue`) and Runtime Environment tab (route `/runtime`: llama.cpp per-component status (main program + CUDA runtime) with resumable download / custom directory, owned by `RuntimeSection.vue`); landing tab is smart — Runtime when llama.cpp is missing, System Info once installed (`EnvironmentDefault.vue` resolver)), `Chat` (local chat: direct SSE streaming to llama-server; the page always renders — sending a message auto-starts the service when stopped (guided pre-checks for missing models / runtime), then unloads other loaded models before streaming so the selected model is the only one in memory), `Models` (merged model page: shell with two tabs — `Download` tab (default, route `/models/download`, owned by `Downloads.vue`: HF Mirror / ModelScope search; backed by `downloadsState.ts`) + `My Models` tab (route `/models/local`, owned by `ModelsLocal.vue`: model list; merges the model download path and imported external directories, each model labeled with its source dir); `/downloads` redirects to the download tab), `ModelDetail` (model detail at `/models/model/:modelId`: file list + description; not in navigation), `ModelSettings` (standalone route page for per-model inference params; not in navigation), `Api` (service start/stop + inference speed monitor (token TPS / uptime) + cursor-incrementally-fetched service log console; former `Monitor` page merged in and redirected), `Settings` (theme / language / download source / directories: llama.cpp & model download paths + external import dirs / tray / API-route mode / check for updates; Windows-only items are hidden per platform by `platform.ts` gates), `Docs` (in-app bilingual tutorial page; per-section lazy content with remote-first fetch: GitHub main → disk cache → bundled fallback, source badge + refresh + open-on-GitHub) and `DocsReader` (phone-tier per-section reader at `/docs/:id`; desktop tiers redirect back to `/docs`, and it is not a navigation destination). Navigation order (shared by `Sidebar.vue` and `MobileNav.vue`): Home → Chat → Models → API → Settings — Docs left the nav bars and is reached from an entry card at the top of Settings |
| `frontend/src/docs/` | In-app tutorial source: `manifest.ts` (typed section list + lazy zh/en raw loaders; `docs.test.ts` enforces id uniqueness, bilingual completeness and injection hygiene) plus the zh/en markdown bodies — bundled at build time and fetched remotely from main by `core/remotedocs.go` (see "Documentation and In-App Tutorial") |
| `frontend/src/components/` | `Sidebar` (desktop/tablet navigation + collapse + system-ready status), `MobileNav` (phone-tier bottom tab bar; consumes the shared `NAV_ITEMS` from `lib/navigation.ts` and prefers the phone-tier glyph variants), `UpdateModal` (update download modal), `TaskDock` (global floating task-card pill: free-draggable with edge snapping and position memory via `dockPosition.ts`; download progress + in-memory model unload; watches the `dockNudge.ts` counter for immediate re-poll on chat-driven load/unload — unload clicks dim the row instantly and it disappears once the unload completes), `RuntimeSection` (Runtime Environment tab of the System Environment page: llama.cpp status card + download / custom-directory actions, own data loading with skeleton / error-retry), `ThemedSelect` (themed custom dropdown: button trigger + in-app option list; variants `field` / `toolbar`) |
| `frontend/src/lib/` | Pure/state modules: `i18n.ts` (bilingual dictionary), `format.ts` (bytes / percent / uptime), `monitor.ts` (TPS formatting, uptime), `chat.ts` + `chatState.ts` (SSE parsing, chat request building, auto-start readiness (`chatReadiness`) and model-swap (`modelsToUnload`) pure helpers, module-level chat state + localStorage persistence), `dock.ts` / `dockNudge.ts` / `downloadStatus.ts` / `taskStatus.ts` / `llamaDownload.ts` (download-state vocabularies and display rules; `dockNudge.ts` is the cross-component nudge bus for immediate TaskDock refresh), `modelFiles.ts` (file sorting + quantization guessing), `downloadsState.ts` (search context), `update.ts` (update check/download state), `selectOptions.ts` (option shape + display-label resolution for ThemedSelect), `dockSpace.ts` (shared bottom-space reservation for the floating TaskDock pill so overlaid controls stay clickable), `limitedQueue.ts` / `latestOnly.ts` / `systemReady.ts` (task queue, polling, readiness), `sysinfo.ts` (Home GPU display model: static snapshot + live monitor sample merging, VRAM aggregation, CUDA Blackwell compatibility classification), `onboarding.ts` (Home quick-start checklist view model; visibility rule and per-step routes, dismissal persisted via the `onboardingDismissed` config field), `markdown.ts` (shared markdown-it instance for chat message rendering; raw HTML disabled as injection defense), `scroll.ts` (stick-to-bottom scroll geometry for the chat view), `remoteDocs.ts` (docs content source resolution + badge time formatting), `platform.ts` (platform state classifier + OS-scoped UI gates: tier, GPU cards, CUDA compat, multi-GPU panel, load-mode options, update mode; App.vue publishes `getOS()` into the module-level singleton), `navigation.ts` (shared `NAV_ITEMS` — the five primary destinations — plus the active-route matcher for both `Sidebar.vue` and `MobileNav.vue`), `keyboard.ts` (soft-keyboard visibility heuristic for the phone tier: editable focus + visual-viewport shrink, toggles `html.keyboard-open`), `safeArea.ts` (Android insets consumer: `GetSafeArea` + the native safe-area event published as `--safe-area-js-*` custom properties, system bars and soft keyboard on separate channels; desktop no-op), `layout.ts` (three-tier responsive breakpoint constants — mobile ≤767 / tablet 768–1099 / desktop >1099 — the single source of truth mirrored by every `@media` literal), `serverLog.ts` (cursor-based incremental server-log fetch client for Api.vue: append/merge with reset-on-gap and a ring-capped view window), `modelTune.ts` (auto-tune success-toast interpolation params + CPU-only message variant selection), `linkHandler.ts` (delegated click handler for untrusted-markdown containers: absolute http(s) links open in the system browser via the Wails runtime, everything else is blocked), `dockPosition.ts` (pure geometry + localStorage for the draggable TaskDock capsule: edge snapping, safe-band clamping, resize-proof position memory) |
| `frontend/src/store.ts` | Global reactive store (`appConfig`): loads the persisted config via `GetConfig`, exposes app-wide state (theme / language / directories / download source / server access mode / tray / API-route mode / sidebar / onboarding dismissal) with optimistic setters that persist through backend bindings; theme / sidebar cached in localStorage for a correct first frame |
| `frontend/src/styles/` | Contains `global.css` (CSS variable theming: semantic tokens like `--bg-primary` / `--surface`, light/dark switched via `html[data-theme]`) |
| `frontend/src/__tests__/` | Frontend unit tests (vitest, covering `store.ts` config loading and `lib/` pure functions: formatting, download queue / task status, chat SSE, monitor sampling, update, system readiness, i18n, etc.) |
| `frontend/src/dev/` | In-repo mock backend for `npm run dev:mock` (vite `--mode mock` aliases `@wailsio/runtime` to `mockRuntime.ts`): fake runtime with a numeric method-ID dispatch table plus the handler/data tables in `mockData.ts`; both must be extended when bindings change — unknown IDs and method names are logged AND rejected, never silently swallowed |
| `frontend/bindings/` | Wails v3 auto-generated TypeScript bindings (`wails3 generate bindings -clean=true -ts`) — **do not edit manually**; regenerated inside `wails3 task build:frontend` and in CI |

> Note: core/engine.go was dissolved into the per-domain files above (config / sysinfo / gguf / llamacpp / archive / preset / server / hf / tasks / update / fsutil). New functional domains must get their own file in core/ — do not grow any single file into a catch-all and do not recreate a generic engine.go.

## Wails Binding Mechanism (Important)

- Backend methods are declared in `core/app.go` as `func (a *App) Xxx(...)`; `core.App` is registered as a Wails v3 service in the root `main.go` (`application.New(application.Options{ Services: []application.Service{application.NewService(app)}, ... })`), which binds every exported method except the v3 lifecycle hooks. Lifecycle lives in `App.ServiceStartup` / `ServiceShutdown` (main.go no longer references hook names).
- The frontend calls exclusively through `frontend/src/wails.ts`, whose typed wrappers statically import the GENERATED bindings at `frontend/bindings/github.com/CodeNeow/MyLlama/core/app` (the `@wailsio/runtime` package supplies `Call.ByID` / `CancellablePromise`; calls dispatch by numeric method ID). **The `core` namespace comes from the Go package name `core`**: if the package name or binding type ever changes, `wails.ts`'s `app()` and the generated bindings under `frontend/bindings/` must all be updated in sync.
- When adding or modifying backend methods: edit `core/app.go`, regenerate the bindings (`wails3 generate bindings`, also run inside `wails3 task build:frontend`), update the wrappers in `wails.ts`, and extend `frontend/src/dev/mockRuntime.ts`'s method-ID table (plus a handler in `mockData.ts`) if the mock must serve the new method — in the same commit as the callers to avoid intermediate states.
- Backend calls no longer go through a runtime-injected global. Running `npm run dev` (plain vite) without the Wails runtime does not throw at call time: the statically imported bindings fail at FETCH time — this is expected behavior, not a bug. To debug the UI in a plain browser, use `npm run dev:mock`, which aliases `@wailsio/runtime` to the in-repo fake runtime (`frontend/src/dev/mockRuntime.ts` + `mockData.ts`).
- When the backend returns structs, JSON field names follow struct tags (e.g., `DlTask`'s `sizeHuman`). After modifying a returned struct, verify that the corresponding frontend interface stays in sync.

## Multi-role Collaboration and Workflows

This file covers all Agent tools, but the role rules below do not all apply to every tool simultaneously. Roles are determined by **explicit task instructions from the user at the start of the task**: if the user says "you are the reviewer", that session assumes reviewer duties; if the user says "you are the implementation agent" (or delivers an implementation task package), that session assumes implementation agent duties; if the user says "you are the issues finder", that session assumes issues finder duties. The implementation agent defaults to a `general-purpose` sub-agent. Simply reading AGENTS.md, using a vendor model, or completing implementation and self-testing does not automatically grant reviewer privileges.

When no role is declared, follow the remaining rules in this file normally (including direct commits per the "Local Commit Strategy"). Unless the user explicitly reassigns roles within the current task, only one reviewer may exist per batch. Implementation agents must not promote themselves to reviewer, approve their own changes, or treat their own completion report as final acceptance; reviewers must not assume the user's chosen implementation agent's role just because they could edit code themselves.

All agents must protect unrelated user changes and respect this file's scope discipline, quality gates, repo hygiene, and remote/destructive operation limits. Do not delete failing tests, skip quality gates, or expand exemptions to get a green result.

Without compromising architecture boundaries, behavioral correctness, test coverage, or quality gates, all plans and implementations should optimize end-to-end completion time: eliminate foreseeable rework first, merge required production changes and tests within the same ownership scope, and parallelize non-conflicting read-only checks. Do not trade speed for expanded exemptions, lowered assertions, skipped tests, or widened unreviewed scope.

This file retains only persistent invariants and verification discipline; stage status, task packages, debt lists, decisions, and date-stamped evidence belong in issue comments or `docs/` authoritative documents. No agent's completion report is a final-acceptance source of truth.

### Reviewer Responsibilities (applies when the user declares "you are the reviewer")

- The reviewer's core input is **the commands and goals issued by the user**, not issues. After the user assigns a task, the reviewer converts the goal into an executable plan and **persistently drives the plan and verification** across the task lifecycle: the plan evolves with implementation feedback, and verification covers every implementation round, not just the final one.
- Full closed loop: understand the user's command and goal → formulate a plan → break into task packages for the implementation agent → review actual diffs → run quality gates → accept → create a local commit per the "Local Commit Strategy".
- The reviewer **must not self-implement**: all implementation is done by the implementation agent (default `general-purpose` sub-agent) to avoid self-review. This exception applies only when the user explicitly requests the reviewer to implement directly in the current task.
- Pulling and reviewing issues is an **optional input** for the reviewer, not the default starting point: when the user requests it, or when the task involves fixing existing issues, use `gh issue list` / `gh issue view <N>` to pull remote issues. For each issue, reproduce or locate `file:line` evidence to confirm it is real. For non-existent issues, explain the conclusion in a comment and do not plan a fix.
- Plan formulation: prioritize by user goals, impact, and risk; the plan may be a single task package or multiple packages, all delivered to the implementation agent. Each task package must state: goal, allowed modification paths, forbidden paths, expected behavior, required new or updated tests, mandatory verification commands, delivery evidence, explicit exit criteria, and whether user-visible behavior changes require syncing the in-app tutorial (`frontend/src/docs`) and screenshots.
- Review order is fixed: review actual diff, authorized paths, key behavior, and focused tests first, then run expensive full quality gates (`make check` / `scripts/check.ps1`; see "Pre-commit Test Tiers"). When static review or focused review reveals blocking issues, form a fix task package first; do not run the full gate early.
- Persistent verification: after every implementation round, the reviewer must re-read the actual diff, review against specification compliance, implementation quality, boundary and behavior, and test sufficiency item by item, and personally run applicable verification commands. Do not rely solely on the implementation agent's self-report. Blocking issues, test failures, missing acceptance evidence, or growing technical debt mean no submission — form a fix task package with file, behavior, and command evidence and continue until all exit criteria for the batch are met.
- Only the reviewer may create a local commit after acceptance is verified; the commit body records actual quality gate results.

### Implementation Agent Responsibilities (defaults to `general-purpose` sub-agent; applies when the user declares "you are the implementation agent")

- The implementation agent is responsible for implementing and verifying per the task package (or user instructions): only modify paths and behavior within the authorized scope; implement expected behavior and tests; run specified verification commands; report modified files, key design decisions, actual commands and full results, known limitations, and unfinished items. Self-reported pass is only delivery evidence pending reviewer re-validation.
- Mechanical fixes, test additions, and formatting cleanups that are deterministically verifiable within the authorized scope should be completed directly without pausing for minor self-resolvable issues; only stop and request direction when the work requires expanding authorized paths, changing behavior or verification contracts, lowering quality gates, or executing remote/destructive operations.
- The implementation agent must not run `git add`, `commit`, `push`, PR, `merge`, or similar operations. After implementation and self-testing, stop at an unstaged working tree and wait for reviewer review or user instructions. Issues found by the implementation agent become fix task packages in the next round by the reviewer.

### Issues Finder Responsibilities (applies when the user declares "you are the issues finder")

- The issues finder is responsible for finding real problems in the project, verifying them, and submitting remote issues per the "Issue Tracking" chapter rules.
- **Verification process (interaction-first)**: prefer Playwright MCP to discover functional defects via real user interactions — operate through the core flows item by item, such as: home page system info loading, model scanning and parameter settings, service start/stop and API calls, download task management, theme switching, etc. After interactive confirmation that the problem exists, return to the code to locate the root cause (`file:line` evidence).
- Only when interactive verification passes (core functionality is sound) does the issues finder shift to code audit for non-interactive issues (style, a11y, i18n, security, dead code, documentation gaps, etc.).
- When the user assigns this role, it is treated as authorization to create remote issues. Before submitting, cross-check existing remote issues to avoid duplicates, and follow all rules in the "Issue Tracking" chapter: form templates, severity prefixes and labels, `file:line` evidence, acceptance criteria, and body redaction. For batch findings, create a top-level Tracker overview issue first; create separate child issues for each P0/P1 finding; P2/P3 may be merged into a summary issue.
- Sensitive security vulnerabilities (credential leaks, injection, privilege escalation, etc.) must not be filed as public issues. Report them privately via GitHub Security Advisories (`Security > Report a vulnerability`). After the fix lands, a non-sensitive tracking issue may be opened.
- This authorization covers only issue creation and maintenance; push, open PR, merge, and other remote operations still require explicit user authorization.
- Creating or updating remote issues is also subject to the "Git Workflow" retry rules: for network failures, wait a period (e.g., 30–60 seconds) and retry; multiple retries at different times usually succeed. Only report and pause when the failure is confirmed to be an authentication, permission, or conflict error, or when consecutive retries still fail.

## Git Workflow

- Active integration happens on the local `main` branch — commit there by default; `main` is both the integration and release branch (a release is a version-bump + CHANGELOG commit followed by the annotated tag). Only create feature branches when the user explicitly requests it or when changes need isolated review (e.g., preparing a PR for an external collaborator), and state the reason before the task.
- In role-based collaboration (see "Multi-role Collaboration and Workflows"), local commits are made only by the session holding reviewer duties; sessions declared as implementation agents stop at an unstaged working tree and do not commit.
- Do not switch or create branches on your own initiative; if unsure about branch choice before committing, confirm with the user first.
- Remote operations (push, `gh issue create`, etc.) require explicit user authorization before execution.
- Feature branches are temporary and must be deleted immediately after PR merge (both remote `git push origin --delete <branch>` and local `git branch -D <branch>`); on merge, try `gh pr merge --delete-branch`; if that does not take effect, manually clean up to avoid leftover merged branches.
- Remote operations (push, `gh issue create`, etc.) may fail due to unstable network: do not declare failure immediately; wait a period (e.g., 30–60 seconds) and retry. Multiple retries at different times usually succeed. Only report and pause when the failure is confirmed to be a non-network error such as authentication, permission, or conflict, or when consecutive retries still fail.

## Code Standards

### Go Backend

- All Go code must pass `gofmt`, `go build ./...`, and `golangci-lint run` (zero diagnostics for govet / ineffassign / unused); never swallow errors — wrap them with context using `fmt.Errorf("...: %w", err)`.
- Concurrent shared state uses explicit mutexes (project convention: `configMu` / `serverLogsMu` / `downloadMu` / `dlTasksMu`, etc.); do not introduce new unlocked shared variables.
- Download state machine (`downloadState.Status`) values: `idle / fetching / queued / downloading / paused / extracting / done / error / cancelled`. The frontend mirrors all download-status vocabularies (llama.cpp download / model tasks / app update) in `frontend/src/lib/downloadStatus.ts`; adding or renaming any status requires updating that module, the exhaustive Record tables in `frontend/src/__tests__/` (llamaDownload / dock / taskStatus — vue-tsc fails on a missing key), and the UI `statusLabel` / i18n maps (Runtime.vue, TaskDock.vue).
- Logs use `log.Println` with a consistent prefix (`[INFO]` / `[WARN]` / `[ERROR]` / `[OK]`); service logs flow through the `serverLogs` ring buffer.
- Launching external child processes must call `hideWindow(cmd)` to prevent GUI applications from flashing a console window (see `hidewindow_windows.go`).
- New behavior must include focused tests: use the standard library `testing`, placed in same-package `*_test.go`; write concise English comments describing the behavior under test.

### Vue / TypeScript Frontend

- `npm run build` (vue-tsc strict) must produce zero errors; no unused variables, imports, or dead code.
- Styles use the project's own semantic tokens beyond `var(--cn-*)` (`--bg-primary` / `--surface` / `--text-primary` / `--border`, etc.); light/dark themes are switched via `html[data-theme]`; new colors must provide both light and dark values.
- Component props / emits use `defineProps<T>` / `defineEmits` typed; `any` must not appear (tests and mocks are exempt).
- New pages must register a route in `router/index.ts`; primary destinations are added to `NAV_ITEMS` in `lib/navigation.ts` (consumed by both `Sidebar.vue` and `MobileNav.vue`).
- User-visible copy is bilingual via the i18n dictionary (`lib/i18n.ts`); never hardcode UI strings. Comments are in English throughout.
- Behavior changes must add or update focused vitest tests (`src/__tests__/`); only mock side-effect-bearing dependency chains (Wails bridge, network, time). Do not mock pure functions or pure data modules.

### General

- When fixing bugs, limit changes to the fault site and its related files; do not mix in unrelated refactoring.
- For cross-frontend-backend changes (e.g., adding binding methods), `app.go`, `wails.ts`, and the frontend caller must be updated in a single commit to avoid intermediate states.
- For changes involving the download state machine, service start/stop, or config file structure (`myllama-config.json`), also verify backward compatibility of old data (`loadConfig`'s default-value fallback logic and the legacy `llama-desktop-config.json` / `llama-gui-config.json` migration chain).
- New behavior must include focused tests; when modifying or deleting existing tests, explain the reason. Do not delete assertions to pass quality gates.

## Pre-commit Test Tiers

Verification strength is determined primarily by behavioral risk and ownership boundaries; file count is only a fallback signal and cannot alone prove risk level.

- **No-test commit**: changes documentation only, or changes only comments that do not affect compilation, lint, or runtime behavior. Skip the test suite; run `git diff --check` and applicable documentation checks.
- **Local commit**: typically no more than 3 non-documentation files within the same module or ownership scope, and does not hit high-risk conditions. Run the affected side's quality gates (backend: `go build` + `go test` + `gofmt -l` + `golangci-lint run`; frontend: `npm run build` + `npm test`) and the affected focused tests.
- **Medium commit**: 4–5 non-documentation files but still confined to the same module, with a single behavior and clear focused coverage; local verification may continue. The commit body must explain the scope and the rationale for not running the full suite.
- **Full commit**: cross-module or cross-ownership linkage, high-risk behavioral changes, or 6+ non-documentation files that cannot be proven to be purely local mechanical changes. Run the full `make check` / `scripts/check.ps1`.
- Regardless of file count, the following always qualify as full commits:
  - Changes to config persistence structure, shared state, service start/stop logic, or the download state machine;
  - New backend binding methods, API endpoints, or external protocol/response structures;
  - Changes to shared test infrastructure, CI configuration, or the quality gate scripts themselves.
- File count excludes pure documentation, pure comments, and artifacts mechanically generated by the same command that have been verified for drift; new tests, fixtures, snapshots, and configs count as non-documentation files.
- If any required verification command fails, the commit must not proceed; fix the failure, re-run the applicable verification, and confirm it passes before proceeding.
- **Current test baseline**: the backend has focused tests covering the `core` package (config persistence, GGUF parsing, model scanning, preset generation, download/HF/ModelScope network tests, system parsing, service command construction, etc.); the frontend has vitest for `store.ts` and `lib/` pure functions. New behavior must include focused tests; do not skip tests citing "no test framework".

## Local Commit Strategy

Use Conventional Commits in the form `type(scope): English subject`, with the subject on a single line. Existing types: `feat` / `fix` / `docs` / `chore` / `refactor` / `test` / `perf` / `security`. Scopes such as `backend` / `frontend` / `build` / `models` / `server` / `downloads` / `config` etc., used only when meaningful.

The detailed body must include the following structure:

```text
Summary:
- <primary changes, grouped by domain: Backend / Frontend / Tests / Docs, etc.>

Verification:
- <actual verification commands run and pass results; full commits must record complete quality gate results>

Remaining gaps:
- <explicitly state unfinished follow-up work; write None if there are none>
```

- Stage files by explicit path. Before committing, check `git status --short`, `git diff --cached --stat`, and `git diff --cached --check`; the working tree must be clean after commit.
- External implementation agents must not stage or commit; only the reviewer may do so after re-reviewing the actual diff, confirming all task package exit criteria are met, and personally completing the required verification. If review reveals issues, enter the next fix round without committing.

## Versioning and Releases

- The authoritative source for changelogs is the root `CHANGELOG.md`: before a release, add the corresponding version entry (with date). **Tag annotation messages and GitHub Release bodies are copied from this entry** to keep them in sync; do not rely on GitHub "auto-generate release notes" (this repo integrates directly on `dev` with no PRs, so auto-generation only produces a compare link).
- Entries summarize the release as a whole: a short paragraph plus a few bullets covering **source-code changes only** (Backend / Frontend behavior, build/CI); documentation-only edits (README, screenshots, CHANGELOG itself, AGENTS.md) are not listed. Do NOT write per-commit breakdowns or commit hashes; keep each entry a concise, user-facing digest.
- Entries are bilingual with Chinese on top: a `## 中文` section (top) followed by an `## English` section (bottom) — starting with **v0.3.3**; v0.3.0–v0.3.2 entries are English-first per-commit records and are preserved as-is, while entries before v0.3.0 were removed along with their tags/releases (only the "历史版本" note remains in CHANGELOG.md). The frontend update modal extracts the section matching the UI language (see `frontend/src/lib/update.ts` `extractReleaseNotes`, which handles both marker orders); tag messages and Release bodies keep both sections so the in-app notes stay language-appropriate.
- Version tags are annotated tags (`git tag -a vX.Y.Z`) with the message taken from the CHANGELOG entry. Before tagging, confirm quality gates pass. Pushing tags is a remote operation and requires user authorization.
- GitHub Release bodies are not automatically synced from tag messages: when creating or updating a Release, paste the body from the corresponding CHANGELOG entry. This is a remote operation requiring explicit user authorization.
- Releases must keep `core/VERSION`, `wails.json` `info.productVersion` and `frontend/package.json` `version` in sync — all three carry the app version (`core/VERSION` and release tags use the `v` prefix; the other two do not).

## Documentation and In-App Tutorial

- `README.md` is the Chinese primary documentation. `README_en.md` is the English counterpart.
- Screenshots live under `docs/screenshots/zh/` and `docs/screenshots/en/`; each document references the set matching its own language. When a UI change alters a captured page, re-capture in the same session when possible; otherwise record the staleness explicitly under the commit body's "Remaining gaps".
- `CHANGELOG.md` entries are bilingual with Chinese on top (`## 中文` first, `## English` below) and summarize the release as a whole; entries before v0.3.0 were removed along with their tags/releases, leaving only a short historical note.
- The in-app tutorial (`frontend/src/docs/{zh,en}/*.md`, rendered by the Docs page) is a documentation surface on equal footing with the README. Any user-visible behavior change — new feature, added/changed/removed flow, renamed or removed UI element, new setting — must check the affected tutorial sections and update them in the same change (same commit when the paths allow it); zh and en are updated together, mirroring each other. Refactors, fixes without behavior change, and test-only changes do not trigger this.
- Tutorial-only fixes reach users once pushed to `main` (the Docs page fetches remote updates from the repo's main branch with a disk-cache + bundled fallback); they do not need to wait for a release and are not listed in CHANGELOG entries (docs-only edits). The bundled copy refreshes at the next release.
- Structural changes (adding/removing a section) follow the manifest pattern: a section id in `frontend/src/docs/manifest.ts`, matching zh/en markdown files, and `docs.section.*` i18n title keys — `docs.test.ts` enforces completeness. Because the section list is code, such changes run the frontend quality gates (local commit tier), not the no-test docs tier.
- The `frontend/src/docs/{lang}/*.md` layout and section ids are part of the remote-docs fetch contract (`core/remotedocs.go` builds its URLs from them): moving or renaming them silently breaks remote fetch for released versions (they degrade gracefully to cache/bundled). Reorganize only with a strong reason and state the impact.

## Repository Hygiene

- Before committing, `git status --short` must contain only intentionally modified files for the current task; `git diff --check` must produce no errors.
- Do not commit: `node_modules/`, `frontend/dist/`, `build/` (including compiled exe artifacts), model files under `LLM-Models/`, `llama-cpp/`, `myllama-config.json` (local config, may contain machine-specific paths), `myllama-benchcache.json` (local RAM-bandwidth benchmark cache), `myllama-docscache/` (remote-docs disk cache), `*.log`, `.zcode/plans/`.
- Screenshot and other documentation assets are committed under `docs/` (e.g., `docs/screenshots/`).
- When adding new ignore patterns, update `.gitignore` in sync.

## Issue Tracking

Issues live at `https://github.com/CodeNeow/MyLlama/issues`. Any non-trivial defect or planned work should be filed as an issue to make progress visible; keep the list high signal-to-noise. This chapter applies as execution rules when the Issues finder role submits remote issues, and to anyone creating issues.

### Creating Issues

- Web-created issues use the form templates under `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`: daily bugs use `bug-report.yml`; structured findings from audits or code reviews use `audit-finding.yml` (includes `file:line` evidence and acceptance criteria).
- Batch findings (e.g., a full audit): create a top-level Tracker overview issue, with each child issue linked in a priority table. Create separate child issues for each P0/P1 finding; P2/P3 may be merged into a summary issue.
- Sensitive security vulnerabilities (credential leaks, injection, privilege escalation, etc.) must not be filed as public issues. Report them privately via GitHub Security Advisories. After the fix lands, a non-sensitive tracking issue may be opened.
- Issue bodies must never contain secrets or machine-specific absolute paths (e.g., paths from `myllama-config.json`). Redact tokens, secrets, DSNs, and paths before submitting, including in logs and screenshots.

### Titles and Labels

- Finding-class titles add a severity prefix: `[P0]` / `[P1]` / `[P2]` / `[P3]`; other titles use `[Bug]` / `[Tracker]`. Keep the title on one line and name the affected component or area, e.g., `[P1] child-process console window flashes frequently at startup`.
- Apply exactly one priority label (`P0-critical` / `P1-high` / `P2-medium` / `P3-low`) and at least one area label (`frontend` / `backend` / `models` / `downloads` / `server` / `config` / `security`). Labels are created in one shot via `scripts/create-labels.ps1`. Do not invent new labels; apply first.
- Severity reflects impact, not effort: P0 blocks core functionality or is a security vulnerability; P1 materially harms experience or security; P2 is a consistency or polish gap; P3 is a nitpick-level minor issue.

### Required Content (Findings)

A finding issue must include: phenomenon, reproduction steps, `file:line` evidence, impact, and acceptance criteria as a `- [ ]` checklist. Fix suggestions (including diffs) are encouraged but not required. If the finding belongs to a batch, reference the Tracker issue number in the body or a comment.

### Lifecycle

- Use `Fixes #N` in the PR description to associate the fix; the linked issue closes automatically on merge.
- Do not close an issue until acceptance criteria are verifiably met and the relevant quality gates pass; quality gate results are recorded in the PR, not only in the issue.
- When an issue is superseded or duplicated, comment linking to the canonical issue and close it; do not delete.

## Common Pitfalls

- **`wails3 task dev` reports port-in-use**: Vite binds `127.0.0.1:5173` (Taskfile var `VITE_PORT`, default 5173, overridable via the `WAILS_VITE_PORT` env var); end the occupying process before starting.
- **A running `wails3 task dev` session reacts to backend edits**: it hot-reloads Go changes and can leave runtime artifacts in the working tree (e.g. the remote-docs cache) while other work is in flight; any `wails3 generate bindings` / `wails3 task build:frontend` run additionally regenerates `frontend/bindings/`. Before staging, check `git status` and disposition such drift deliberately (commit regenerated bindings on their own or revert them); never kill the user's dev session to "clean up".
- **Go struct changed but frontend does not receive new fields**: verify `wails.ts` wrappers and page interfaces are in sync; `frontend/bindings/` is auto-regenerated by `wails3 task build:frontend` and does not need manual changes.
- **"Start Service" fails on the API page**: `startServerInternal` scans `LLM-Models` and generates presets first; an empty directory returns an error (`no models found in the LLM-Models directory`) — this is expected behavior. Confirm GGUF files exist on the "Models" page first.
- **Stopping service on Windows**: `stopServerInternal` terminates llama-server via `cmd.Process.Signal(os.Kill)`; do not use `taskkill /IM llama-server.exe` externally with broad force-kill, to avoid killing other instances.
- **`gofmt -l` reports many existing files on this machine**: the repo commits as LF; Windows checkout (`core.autocrlf`) as CRLF causes `gofmt` to report the entire file. When judging formatting issues, use `git -c core.autocrlf=false diff` to inspect actual changes; do not rewrite untouched line endings as a side effect.
- **`frontend/dist: no matching files found` when running backend commands locally**: `go:embed` depends on `frontend/dist`; run `cd frontend && npm run build` before running backend commands.
- **GitHub Release page shows only a "Full Changelog" compare link**: auto-generated release notes aggregate by PR; this repo integrates directly on `dev` with no PRs, so the generated result is only a compare link. Tag messages are not synced to the Release body automatically; paste from the corresponding `CHANGELOG.md` entry (see "Versioning and Releases").
