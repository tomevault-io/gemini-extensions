## Repository Guidelines

### Project Summary

**Ora** is a privacy-first macOS voice assistant that runs fully on-device:

```
Voice → (FluidAudio Parakeet) → (MLX + Qwen 2.5) → (Kokoro TTS) → Voice/UI
```

**Primary differentiator:** Fast, reliable, auditable actions (Calendar/Reminders/Contacts first), minimal cloud, and a UI that makes the assistant feel predictable and safe.

### Project Structure & Modules
- `Ora/Ora`: Main macOS app source (Audio, ASR, LLM, Tools, TTS, UI). Keep changes small and reuse existing helpers.
- `Ora/OraTests`: XCTest coverage for audio, transcription, LLM, tools; mirror new logic with focused tests.
- `scripts/`: Build/sign helpers (`build.sh`, signing scripts).
- `docs/`: Documentation (architecture, stories, design).
- `Vendor/`: External inference engines (MLX, Parakeet, Kokoro TTS).
- `project.yml`: XcodeGen configuration (generates `.xcodeproj`).

### Key Resources
| Resource | Location | Purpose |
|:---------|:---------|:--------|
| **System Prompt** | `Ora/Resources/system-prompt.txt` | LLM system prompt template with `{{variable}}` placeholders. Edit this file to change assistant behavior without modifying code. |

### Documentation Organization (MANDATORY)

**Always maintain a clean project structure:**

| Document Type | Location | Examples |
|:--------------|:---------|:---------|
| User stories | `docs/stories/` | Feature specs, PRD, implementation plans |
| Reports & investigations | `docs/` (in appropriate subfolders) | Performance reports, bug investigations, audits |
| Architecture docs | `docs/stories/` | System design, component diagrams |
| Setup & guides | `docs/` | Environment setup, testing guides |

- **All user stories MUST be collected in `docs/stories/`**
- **All reports, investigations, or other documents MUST be collected in appropriate folders under `docs/`**
- Create subfolders as needed (e.g., `docs/reports/`, `docs/investigations/`)
- Keep documentation up-to-date when implementation changes

### Build, Test, Run

**Build script commands:**
| Command | When to Use |
|:--|:--|
| `./build.sh` | Build only, don't launch |
| `./build.sh run` | Build and launch (kills old instance first) |
| `./build.sh clean` | Fresh start (removes DerivedData) |
| `./build.sh reset-perms` | Reset TCC permissions (Accessibility, Calendar, Reminders, Contacts) |
| `./build.sh test` | Run tests with token-optimized output |
| `./build.sh test-perms` | Run tests with permission prompts enabled |
| `./build.sh test-tsan` | Run tests with Thread Sanitizer enabled |
| `./build.sh logs` | Stream unified logs (includes debug level) |
| `./build.sh logs --category <name>` | Stream logs for specific category (e.g., `chunker`, `tts`, `llm`) |
| `./build.sh open-results` | Open `.xcresult` bundle in Xcode |
| `./build.sh sign` | Build, sign with Developer ID, notarize, and optionally create DMG (for distribution) |

### Viewing Logs (macOS Unified Logging)

**Important:** macOS filters out debug and info level logs by default. Use these commands to see all log levels:

**Stream logs in real-time:**
```bash
# All Ora logs (recommended)
./build.sh logs

# Specific category
./build.sh logs --category chunker
./build.sh logs --category tts
./build.sh logs --category llm
```

**View recent logs (last N minutes):**
```bash
# All levels including debug/info (REQUIRED for most debugging)
log show --debug --info --predicate 'subsystem == "com.ora.app"' --last 5m

# Specific category
log show --debug --info --predicate 'subsystem == "com.ora.app" AND category == "chunker"' --last 5m

# Search for specific text
log show --debug --info --predicate 'subsystem == "com.ora.app"' --last 5m | grep -i "search term"
```

**Log categories:** `audio`, `asr`, `llm`, `tools`, `tts`, `chunker`, `ui`, `orchestration`, `permissions`, `models`, `persistence`

**Log levels (in order of severity):**
- `.debug` - Detailed debugging (filtered by default, use `--debug` flag)
- `.info` - General flow info (filtered by default, use `--info` flag)
- `.notice` - Important events (always visible)
- `.error` - Errors that don't crash
- `.fault` - Critical errors with stack traces

**Common workflows:**

```bash
# Normal development
./build.sh run

# Permissions stopped working (prompt keeps appearing)
./build.sh reset-perms
./build.sh run
# Grant permissions when prompted

# Fresh start (new clone, weird build issues)
./build.sh clean
./build.sh reset-perms
./build.sh run
```

**Why `reset-perms`?** macOS TCC tracks permissions by bundle ID + CDHash. Every rebuild changes the CDHash, so old permission grants don't apply. `reset-perms` clears stale entries so the next grant applies to the current build.

**Skip setup wizard (for testing):**
```bash
# Mark setup as complete to bypass the setup wizard
defaults write com.ora.app "com.ora.setupComplete" -bool true

# Reset hotkey to default (Option+Space) if it was changed
defaults delete com.ora.app "com.ora.hotkeyConfiguration"

# Then run the app
./build.sh run
```

**Other commands:**
- **Run tests:** `./build.sh test` (preferred) or `xcodebuild test -project Ora.xcodeproj -scheme Ora`.
- **Restart app manually:** `killall Ora 2>/dev/null || true; open -n build/Build/Products/Release/Ora.app`.

### Querying Persisted Data (SwiftData / SQLite)

**Store location:** `~/Library/Application Support/Ora/default.store` (SQLite)

**How persistence works:**
- `PersistenceManager` (`@MainActor` singleton) manages all SwiftData operations
- `Session` stores conversation messages as a JSON blob in `messagesData` (encode on write, decode on read)
- Messages have roles: `.user`, `.assistant`, `.tool`
- Tool results are persisted as `.tool` role messages with format: `[ToolResult: <toolName>] <summary> (auditId=<uuid>)`
- Tool summaries are capped at 500 chars; full output lives in `AuditLogEntryModel`
- Saves are **debounced** (250ms default) — rapid appends coalesce into one `context.save()`
- `flushSave()` forces immediate persistence (called on app termination)
- Slow operations (>10ms) are logged via `os_signpost` + threshold-gated `Logger` (category: `persistence`)

**Query persisted messages:**
```bash
# List all messages in the most recent session (role + first 200 chars)
sqlite3 ~/Library/Application\ Support/Ora/default.store \
  "SELECT CAST(ZMESSAGESDATA AS TEXT) FROM ZSESSION ORDER BY ZUPDATEDAT DESC LIMIT 1;" \
  | python3 -c "
import sys, json
msgs = json.loads(sys.stdin.read().strip())
for m in msgs:
    print(f'[{m[\"role\"]}] {m[\"content\"][:200]}')
"

# Count messages per role in the latest session
sqlite3 ~/Library/Application\ Support/Ora/default.store \
  "SELECT CAST(ZMESSAGESDATA AS TEXT) FROM ZSESSION ORDER BY ZUPDATEDAT DESC LIMIT 1;" \
  | python3 -c "
import sys, json, collections
msgs = json.loads(sys.stdin.read().strip())
counts = collections.Counter(m['role'] for m in msgs)
for role, n in sorted(counts.items()): print(f'{role}: {n}')
"

# List recent audit log entries
sqlite3 ~/Library/Application\ Support/Ora/default.store \
  "SELECT ZTOOLNAME, ZSUMMARY, ZSUCCESS FROM ZAUDITLOGENTRYMODEL ORDER BY ZTIMESTAMP DESC LIMIT 10;"

# Show all tables
sqlite3 ~/Library/Application\ Support/Ora/default.store ".tables"
```

**Key tables:** `ZSESSION` (conversations), `ZAUDITLOGENTRYMODEL` (tool execution audit trail), `ZAPPSETTINGS`

**Monitor persistence performance in real-time:**
```bash
# Watch for slow persistence operations (default threshold: 10ms)
./build.sh logs --category persistence

# Lower threshold to see all operations
ORA_PERSISTENCE_SLOW_LOG_THRESHOLD_MS=0 open build/Build/Products/Release/Ora.app
```

### Local Signing for Distribution

**When to use local signing:**
- Testing the full signing/notarization flow before pushing to CI
- Creating manual releases outside of CI/CD
- Debugging signing or notarization issues

**Quick workflow (interactive):**
```bash
./build.sh sign
# Prompts for: Apple ID, app-specific password, Team ID, signing identity
# Builds, signs, notarizes, and optionally creates DMG
```

**Manual workflow (for advanced use):**
```bash
# 1. Build
./build.sh

APP_PATH="build/Build/Products/Release/Ora.app"

# 2. Sign with Developer ID
scripts/ci-release.sh codesign "$APP_PATH"

# 3. Notarize (takes 2-5 minutes)
scripts/ci-release.sh notarize "$APP_PATH" \
  "your@email.com" \
  "app-specific-password" \
  "TEAM_ID"

# 4. (Optional) Create DMG
scripts/ci-release.sh create-dmg "$APP_PATH" "/tmp/Ora-1.0.0.dmg"
scripts/ci-release.sh codesign-dmg "/tmp/Ora-1.0.0.dmg"
```

**Available helper commands:**
```bash
scripts/ci-release.sh
  codesign <app-path>                     # Deep-sign app bundle
  codesign-dmg <dmg-path>                 # Sign DMG file
  notarize <app> <id> <pw> <team>         # Notarize with Apple
  create-dmg <app-path> <dmg-path>        # Create DMG from app
  sparkle-sign <dmg> <tools> <key>        # Sign with Sparkle EdDSA
  generate-appcast <dmg> <tools> <ver> <key>  # Generate appcast.xml
```

**Requirements for local signing:**
- Developer ID Application certificate installed in Keychain
- Apple ID with app-specific password (generate at appleid.apple.com)
- Team ID from developer.apple.com/account

**Note:** The `./build.sh sign` command uses ad-hoc signing for the initial build, then applies Developer ID signing afterward. This is faster than signing during the xcodebuild step.

**Release safety rules (CRITICAL):**
- Never overwrite an existing GitHub release asset for a published version (no `--clobber` on published tags).
- If a release artifact is wrong, cut a new patch version and publish a new tag.
- Always update Sparkle appcast immediately after publishing a new release.
- Always verify appcast `url`, `length`, and `sparkle:edSignature` match the published DMG.
- Always verify the release tag points to the intended release commit.
- For end-to-end release workflows, load the `ora-release` skill.

### Test Output Policy (Token Optimization)

When running tests, report results minimally:
- **Pass:** Only report the summary line (e.g., `✅ Tests: 42/42 passed`)
- **Fail:** Report summary + failure list + artifact paths (`.artifacts/TestResults.xcresult`, `.artifacts/xcodebuild.test.log`)
- **Never paste** full xcodebuild logs or large JSON blobs into chat

For detailed triage workflows, load the `ora-testing` skill.

### Coding Style & Naming
- Favor small, typed structs/enums; maintain existing `MARK` organization.
- Use descriptive symbols; match current commit tone.
- 4-space indent; explicit `self` is intentional—do not remove.
- Keep bridging code (Objective-C++) minimal and well-documented.
- Prefer Swift Concurrency (async/await, actors) over GCD where possible.

### Testing Guidelines
- Add/extend XCTest cases under `Ora/OraTests/*Tests.swift` (`FeatureNameTests` with `test_caseDescription` methods).
- Always run tests before handoff; add fixtures for new parsing/formatting scenarios.
- After any code change, rebuild and test before declaring completion.
- **Preferred test command:** `./build.sh test` (token-optimized output, saves artifacts to `.artifacts/`)
- **Permission prompts in tests:** `./build.sh test` sets `ORA_SKIP_PERMISSION_PROMPTS=1` to avoid interactive OS dialogs. Use `./build.sh test-perms` or `ORA_SKIP_PERMISSION_PROMPTS=0` when you need to verify real prompts.
- **Thread Sanitizer:** `./build.sh test-tsan` or use the `Ora-TSan` scheme directly.
- **Debugging failures:** `./build.sh open-results` to inspect `.xcresult` bundle.

### Review Learnings (Keep Concise)
- Keep action handlers alive; do not `weak` the only instance (menu actions must execute).
- Tear down `NSStatusItem` on shutdown to avoid duplicate menu icons.
- Ensure menu actions have observable behavior and are covered by tests.
- Permission flows: use correct APIs (events vs reminders), map `.authorized`/`.writeOnly` correctly, and prompt accessibility before opening Settings.
- Permission checks must update shared state and post notifications.
- Implement required/optional permission requests as specified; keep docs and code aligned.
- Cover request flows and settings opening in tests; record manual E2E checklists for permission/menu flows.
- **Permission prompt tracking (CRITICAL):** Permission requests MUST go through `PermissionsManager.shared.request()` which handles `PermissionPromptTracker` calls centrally. Do NOT add tracker calls to individual permission files (`MicrophonePermission`, `EventKitPermission`, `ContactsPermission`) - this causes double tracking which breaks focus recovery. The tool-level providers (`EventStoreProvider`, `RemindersStoreProvider`) have their own tracker calls for when tools bypass `PermissionsManager`.
- **Tests + permissions:** Default test runs skip interactive permission prompts via `ORA_SKIP_PERMISSION_PROMPTS=1`. Use `./build.sh test-perms` when you need to exercise real OS permission dialogs.
- **MLX GPU memory (CRITICAL):** MLX caches Metal GPU buffers for reuse, but without limits this cache grows unbounded (15GB+ observed). Always: (1) Set `GPU.set(cacheLimit:)` on model load (512MB recommended), (2) Call `GPU.clearCache()` after each LLM/TTS generation. See `LLMService.swift` and `KokoroEngine.swift` for examples.
- **macOS Logger privacy:** By default, macOS redacts dynamic string interpolation in `Logger` calls as `<private>`. To see actual values during debugging, use `privacy: .public`: `logger.error("Result: '\(String(text), privacy: .public)'")`). **IMPORTANT:** Remove `.public` privacy modifiers before merging - they should only be used temporarily for debugging, never in production code.
- **ASR transcription is never exact (CRITICAL):** Ora is a voice assistant — all user input passes through ASR, which regularly introduces spelling errors, homophones, and phonetic approximations. Every tool that performs search or lookup against user-provided text **must** include a fuzzy matching fallback (Jaro-Winkler via `StringSimilarity`). Pattern: try exact/substring match first, then fall back to fuzzy scoring if no results. See `ContactsSearchTool` for the canonical two-tier implementation.
- **Persistence architecture:** Messages are stored as a JSON blob (`messagesData`) on `Session` in SwiftData. Tool results persist as `.tool` role messages with format `[ToolResult: <toolName>] <summary> (auditId=<uuid>)` — summaries capped at 500 chars, full output in `AuditLogEntryModel`. Saves are debounced (250ms); `flushSave()` on termination. To get audit IDs from tool execution, use `ToolHost.executeWithAudit()` which returns `ToolExecutionRecord` (result + auditEntryID). On failure, `ToolExecutionError` carries the audit ID.

### Commit & PR Guidelines
- Commit messages: short imperative clauses (e.g., "Add calendar tool", "Fix ASR latency"); keep commits scoped.
- PRs/patches should list summary, commands run, screenshots/GIFs for UI changes, and linked issue/reference when relevant.
- **Automated review (MANDATORY):** Every PR must have an `@codex review` comment posted before merging. Add the comment after creating the PR: `gh pr comment <number> --body "@codex review"`.

### Agent Notes
- Use the provided scripts and XcodeGen; avoid adding dependencies or tooling without confirmation.
- Validate behavior against the freshly built bundle; restart via `./build.sh run` to avoid running stale binaries.
- After any code change that affects the app, always rebuild with `./build.sh` and restart the app before validating behavior.
- If you edited code, run `./build.sh run` before handoff; it kills old instances, builds, and relaunches.
- Keep pipeline stages isolated: ASR, LLM, Tools, and TTS should have clear boundaries and not leak state.
- Tool implementations must follow the guardrails pattern (confirmation for state-changing actions).

---

## 2. Git Workflow (CRITICAL)

**Always follow this workflow. Never commit directly to `main`.**

1.  **Create a Feature Branch:**
    ```bash
    git checkout -b fix/descriptive-name     # For bug fixes
    git checkout -b feat/descriptive-name    # For new features
    ```
    *Naming conventions:* `fix/`, `feat/`, `refactor/`, `docs/`, `test/`.

2.  **Commit Changes:**
    ```bash
    git add <specific-files>
    git commit -m "feat: description of change"
    ```

3.  **Push & PR:**
    Push to origin and create a Pull Request against `main`.

4.  **Cleanup:**
    Delete the feature branch after merging.

**Important**: There is an ./agent-tools folder in the root of the project. This is for quick tests, helper scripts and testing. This folder is gitignored and shouldn't be commited per design.

### Branch Hygiene & Multi-Agent Coordination (MANDATORY)

- Always sync `main` before branching: `git fetch origin`, `git checkout main`, `git pull origin main`.
- Use one branch per story/bug; include the story/bug ID in the branch name when possible.
- Keep branches short-lived. If `main` moves significantly, **do not merge** an old branch; create a new branch from current `main` and cherry-pick the relevant commits (no rebase unless explicitly approved).
- Before opening a PR, verify scope: `git log --oneline main..HEAD` and `git diff --stat main...HEAD`. If unrelated files show up, split into separate branches.
- When multiple agents work in parallel, nominate a single owner per story/bug and record active branches in the story doc (or add a dated report in `docs/reports/` when a branch is abandoned).
- If a stale branch is discovered, document it (story note or report), reopen the story if needed, and retire the branch.
- After merge, delete local and remote branches to avoid stale branch drift.

### Branch Completion Rules (CRITICAL - PREVENTS LOST WORK)

**NEVER leave a branch unmerged after completing work:**

1. **Immediate PR after fix:** When a bug fix or feature is complete and tested, create a PR immediately.
2. **Merge before context switch:** Before starting new work, ensure all completed branches are merged to main.
3. **No orphan branches:** A branch with working code that isn't merged is lost work waiting to happen.

**Before ending a session, verify:**
```bash
# Check for unmerged branches with your work
git branch --no-merged main

# If branches exist, either:
# 1. Create PRs and merge them
# 2. Document why they're intentionally unmerged (e.g., WIP, blocked)
```

**Orphan branch audit (run periodically):**
```bash
# List all branches not in main
git branch -a --no-merged main

# For each branch, decide:
# - Merge it (if work is complete)
# - Document and delete (if superseded)
# - Keep with documented reason (if intentionally WIP)
```

**If you discover orphan branches with completed work:**
1. Check if the work is still needed (may have been reimplemented)
2. If needed: cherry-pick or re-apply the fix to current main
3. Document the orphan in `docs/stories/bugs/` if it contains valuable alternative approaches
4. Delete the orphan branch after preserving any valuable code/docs

### Bug Fixes (Non-Story Work)

- Use the same branch hygiene as above even when not using the implement-story skill.
- If a bug has a story/bug doc, update it with branch name, commit count, and verification notes before PR.
### Story Work (When Implementing Specs)

- Prefer the implement-story skill for story work; if not used, still follow the same branch hygiene and doc updates.

### Git Safety Rules (MANDATORY)

**ALWAYS COMMIT, NEVER STASH:**
- **NEVER use `git stash`** to save finished or in-progress implementation work. Stashed code is invisible and easily lost.
- **ALWAYS commit your work** to a branch, even if it's incomplete. Use a WIP commit message like `wip: partial implementation of X`.
- If you need to switch contexts, commit to a feature branch first, then switch.

**DANGEROUS COMMANDS - REQUIRE EXPLICIT USER PERMISSION:**
These commands can cause data loss. **NEVER run them without the user explicitly requesting it:**
- `git stash` / `git stash drop` / `git stash clear`
- `git reset --hard`
- `git clean -fd`
- `rm -rf` on untracked files or directories (always ask or use `git clean -n` first)
- `git checkout -- <file>` (discards changes)
- `git branch -D` (force delete)
- `git push --force` / `git push -f`
- `git rebase` (can rewrite history)
- Any command with `--force` or `-f` flags

**If you find stashed or uncommitted work:**
- Alert the user immediately
- Help recover and commit it to a proper branch
- Never assume stashed code is unimportant

## 5. Tool Implementation Guidelines

### Guardrails Pattern (MANDATORY)

All tools that modify state **must** implement the confirmation pattern:

```swift
protocol Tool {
    var requiresConfirmation: Bool { get }
    func preview(parameters: ToolParameters) async throws -> ToolPreview
    func execute(parameters: ToolParameters) async throws -> ToolResult
}
```

**Confirmation required for:**
- Create event/reminder
- Delete event/reminder
- Send email (if implemented)

**No confirmation needed for:**
- Query calendar
- Search contacts
- List reminders
- Open app/URL

### Scope Minimization

- Fetch only what's needed (don't load entire contact database for a single search)
- Time-bound calendar queries (don't fetch years of history)
- Return minimal data to LLM context

### Audit Logging

Every tool execution must be logged:
```swift
AuditLog.record(
    tool: "calendar.create",
    parameters: [...],
    result: .success(eventId: "..."),
    timestamp: Date(),
    userConfirmed: true
)
```

## 6. Performance Targets

| Metric | Target |
|:-------|:-------|
| ASR partials | Every 200-400ms |
| End-of-speech finalization | ≤300ms |
| LLM time-to-first-token | <400ms (after warmup) |
| TTS audio start | ~500ms for short responses |
| PTT release → first spoken audio | <1.0s median (after warmup) |

### Memory & Stability
- No memory growth over 30 minutes of use
- Graceful fallback: if TTS fails → show text; if LLM fails → dictation-only mode

## 7. v1 Core Use Cases

**Calendar:**
- "Schedule a 30-min meeting with Maddie next week"
- "What's my day look like tomorrow?"
- "Find a 45-min slot this afternoon"

**Reminders:**
- "Remind me to submit expenses on Monday"

**Contacts:**
- "What's Roland's phone number?"

**System:**
- "Open Spotify"
- "Search the web for ..." (opens browser)

---

## 8. UX Principles

1. **Push-to-talk first:** `⌥Space` hotkey (customizable) + menubar mic button (no always-listening by default)
2. **Streaming everywhere:** Live partial transcription, streaming LLM tokens, early TTS
3. **Predictability > Cleverness:** Explicit intent preview before actions
4. **Confirmation gates:** Always ask before state-changing operations
5. **Auditability:** Every action logged, accessible in Preferences
6. **Private Mode:** Toggle to disable voice output, show text only
7. **Model transparency:** User can view all models (LLM, ASR, TTS) in Preferences

---

## 9. Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|:------|:---------|
| **Permissions prompt keeps appearing** | Run `./build.sh reset-perms` then `./build.sh run` and re-grant. |
| **Calendar/Reminders access denied** | Check System Settings → Privacy & Security → Calendar/Reminders. |
| **Contacts access denied** | Check System Settings → Privacy & Security → Contacts. |
| **No audio input** | Check microphone permissions and input device selection. |
| **LLM not responding** | Check model is loaded; verify memory available for inference. |
| **TTS silent** | Check audio output device; verify TTS engine initialization. |
| **Xcode Project out of sync** | Run `xcodegen generate`. |

## 10. Non-Goals (v1)

- "Always listening" wake word by default
- Fully general "do anything on my Mac" automation
- Reading arbitrary Mail inbox locally
- Cloud-based features (local-first only)

---

## 11. Future Phases

**Phase 2:** Wake word (optional), better memory, mail via provider APIs
**Phase 3:** On-device embeddings for local search ("what did I promise last week?")
