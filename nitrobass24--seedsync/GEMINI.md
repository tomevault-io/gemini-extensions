# SeedSync - Claude Code Instructions

## Project Overview

SeedSync is a Docker-based tool that syncs files from a remote seedbox to a local machine using LFTP.

- **Frontend**: Angular 21 (Bootstrap 5.3, Font Awesome 7, Vitest)
- **Backend**: Python 3.13 with Bottle
- **Container**: Multi-arch Docker image (amd64, arm64)
- **Registry**: ghcr.io/nitrobass24/seedsync

## Branches

- **master** - Stable release branch
- **develop** - Integration branch for all new work

## Git Workflow

All work MUST follow this branching discipline:

1. **Always start from `develop`**: Before writing any code, checkout `develop` and pull latest:
   ```bash
   git checkout develop && git pull origin develop
   ```
2. **Create a feature branch**: Every task (feature, bugfix, refactor) gets its own branch off `develop`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/short-description   # or fix/short-description
   ```
3. **Commit only to the feature branch**: Never commit directly to `develop` or `master`.
4. **One concern per branch**: Do not mix unrelated changes into the same branch. If you discover a separate issue while working, finish or stash your current work, then create a new branch for the other issue.
5. **Open a PR to `develop`**: When the work is complete, push the feature branch and open a PR targeting `develop`. Include a summary and test plan. Releases are the only path that PRs to `master` — see the Release Process below.
6. **Do not carry dirty working-tree changes across branches**: Before switching branches, either commit or stash. Never rely on uncommitted edits surviving a `git checkout`.

## Release Process

When merging a PR or completing significant work, follow this release process:

### 1. Update CHANGELOG.md

Add a new version entry at the top with:
- Version number following semver (major.minor.patch)
- Date in YYYY-MM-DD format
- Sections: Changed, Added, Fixed, Removed, Security (as applicable)

Example:
```markdown
## [0.10.0] - 2026-01-27

### Changed
- **Feature name** - Description of change

### Fixed
- **Bug name** - Description of fix
```

### 2. Update MODERNIZATION_PLAN.md

If the change relates to modernization tasks:
- Update task status (🔄 IN PROGRESS → ✅)
- Update version references
- Update architecture diagram if needed

### 3. Update package.json Version

Update the version in `src/angular/package.json` to match the release version. This is displayed on the About page.

### 4. Create Release

Releases use a `release/vX.Y.Z` branch off `develop`, a PR into `master`, and a tag on the resulting merge commit. Never commit the release directly to `develop` or `master`.

```bash
# Branch from the latest develop
git checkout develop && git pull origin develop
git checkout -b release/vX.Y.Z

# Stage the release commit (CHANGELOG / MODERNIZATION_PLAN / package.json)
git add CHANGELOG.md MODERNIZATION_PLAN.md src/angular/package.json
git commit -m "Release vX.Y.Z - Brief description"
git push -u origin release/vX.Y.Z

# Open a PR targeting master
gh pr create --base master --head release/vX.Y.Z \
  --title "Release vX.Y.Z - Brief description" \
  --body "Sync develop → master for vX.Y.Z. See CHANGELOG.md for details."

# After the PR is merged into master, fetch and tag the merge commit
git checkout master && git pull origin master
git tag vX.Y.Z
git push origin vX.Y.Z
```

The CI workflow will automatically:
- Build multi-arch Docker images
- Push to ghcr.io
- Create GitHub release with auto-generated notes

### 5. Update GitHub Release Notes

After CI creates the release, update the release notes with detailed changelog:

```bash
gh release edit vX.Y.Z --repo nitrobass24/seedsync --notes "$(cat <<'EOF'
## What's Changed

### Fixed
- **Bug name** - Description of fix (#issue)

### Changed
- **Feature name** - Description of change

### Added
- **New feature** - Description

## Docker Pull

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/nitrobass24/seedsync:X.Y.Z
```

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/nitrobass24/seedsync/compare/vPREV...vX.Y.Z
EOF
)"
```

Format should match CHANGELOG.md entries with:
- Section headers: Fixed, Changed, Added, Removed, Security
- Bold feature/bug names
- Issue references where applicable
- Always include a "Docker Pull" section with the `docker pull` command for the release version

### 6. Verify Release

- Check GitHub Actions completed successfully
- Verify image is available: `docker pull ghcr.io/nitrobass24/seedsync:X.Y.Z`
- Verify GitHub release notes are formatted correctly

## Version Numbering

- **Major** (X.0.0): Breaking changes, major rewrites
- **Minor** (0.X.0): New features, significant improvements (e.g., Angular upgrade)
- **Patch** (0.0.X): Bug fixes, minor updates

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `CHANGELOG.md` | Release history and notes |
| `MODERNIZATION_PLAN.md` | Project modernization status |
| `src/docker/build/docker-image/Dockerfile` | Multi-stage Docker build |
| `.github/workflows/ci.yml` | CI/CD pipeline |
| `.github/workflows/docs-pages.yml` | Documentation deployment |
| `website/` | Documentation site (Docusaurus) |

## CI/CD Workflows

### CI (`ci.yml`)

Triggers: `push` to `master` or `develop`, `pull_request` against `master` or `develop`, and `push` of a tag matching `v[0-9]+.[0-9]+.[0-9]+`.

Release-relevant matrix:

| Trigger | Build & Test | Publish Image | Create Release |
|---------|--------------|---------------|----------------|
| PR to master | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Push to master | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Push tag (`v*.*.*`) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

- **Build & Test**: Builds Docker image and verifies container starts
- **Publish Image**: Pushes multi-arch image to ghcr.io (only on release tags)
- **Create Release**: Creates GitHub release with auto-generated notes (only on release tags)

### Docs (`docs-pages.yml`)

- Triggers only when `website/` directory changes
- Builds and deploys Docusaurus site to GitHub Pages

## Common Tasks

### Building Locally
```bash
make build    # Build Docker image
make run      # Run container
make logs     # View logs
make stop     # Stop container
```

### Testing
```bash
cd src/angular && npx ng lint    # Angular ESLint
cd src/angular && npx ng test    # Angular Vitest unit tests
# Python tests run in Docker via CI (pytest in test-image)
# CI also runs: Docker build, container startup, web UI accessibility
```

## Test Requirements

Every PR MUST include appropriate test changes. Tests are not optional — they ship with the code.

### When adding a feature
- Add unit tests for all new logic (services, components, utilities, handlers)
- Cover the happy path, edge cases, and error/validation paths
- If adding a new API endpoint, add integration tests using `WebTest`/`TestApp`

### When fixing a bug
- Add a test that reproduces the bug (fails before fix, passes after)
- If the bug was in untested code, add baseline tests for the surrounding logic

### When refactoring
- Existing tests must continue to pass without modification (unless the refactor intentionally changes behavior)
- If refactoring reveals untested code, add tests for it

### When removing code
- Remove or update tests that cover the deleted code
- Do not leave dead test code behind

### Test structure

| Layer | Framework | Location | Runner |
|-------|-----------|----------|--------|
| Angular lint | ESLint (angular-eslint) | `src/angular/eslint.config.js` | `cd src/angular && npx ng lint` |
| Angular unit tests | Vitest | `src/angular/src/**/*.spec.ts` | `cd src/angular && npx ng test` |
| Python unit tests | unittest | `src/python/tests/unittests/` | pytest (in Docker test-image) |
| Python integration tests | unittest + WebTest | `src/python/tests/integration/` | pytest (in Docker test-image) |

### Test conventions
- **Angular**: Use `describe`/`it` from Vitest. Mock services with `vi.fn()`. Use `TestBed` for component tests. Query DOM by text content or stable attributes, not positional selectors (`nth-of-type`).
- **Python**: Use `unittest.TestCase`. Use `unittest.mock.MagicMock`/`patch` for mocking. Integration tests for web handlers use `webtest.TestApp` with `BaseTestWebApp`.
- **Naming**: Test files mirror source files — `foo.service.ts` → `foo.service.spec.ts`, `controller.py` → `test_controller.py`.
- **No flaky tests**: Avoid `time.sleep` in tests where possible. Use `threading.Event` or barriers for synchronization. Use `timeout_decorator` for tests that might hang.

## Code Health

These are guidelines, not hard caps. Their real job is to slow you down and ask "is this still one concern?" Cross them when the code is clearer for it — flag in the PR body when you do.

### Soft size targets

| Unit | Target | When to pause |
|------|--------|---------------|
| File | ≤ 500 lines | At 400, ask "one concern or several?" |
| Class | ≤ 300 lines | If state covers > 2 concerns, extract |
| Function / method | ≤ 40 lines | Longer is OK when linear; deep nesting is not |
| Cyclomatic complexity (per function) | ≤ 12 | Enforced in CI via ruff `C901` (`max-complexity = 12`) |

Cyclomatic complexity is the one number that actually predicts pain — a 200-line linear function is fine; a 40-line function with 5 nested conditionals is dangerous. Use `ruff check --select C901` locally to measure.

### The "before adding" rule

Before adding a method to an existing class, ask:
1. Does this belong in a sibling module/class instead?
2. Does the class already span multiple concerns (auth + persistence + validation, etc.)? If so, extracting first is usually worth the overhead.
3. Prefer composition over accretion — reach for a new collaborator, not a bigger class.

### Signals that you should split

- A focused unit test needs `cls.__new__(cls)` or broad mocking just to exercise one method.
- The constructor initializes unrelated state (e.g., both a model and a command queue and a logger facade).
- One method dominates the file's line count.
- Changes in separate features keep conflicting in the same file.

When you see these, open an issue for the extraction rather than working around them silently.

### Enforcement

- **Qualitative checks**: code review. Reviewers should push back on "this file is getting unwieldy" even without a hard rule.
- **Mechanical checks** (Python): ruff's `C901` (cyclomatic complexity) with `max-complexity = 12`. Enforced in CI; existing outliers are annotated with `# noqa: C901`. Test files (`tests/**`) are excluded via `per-file-ignores` in `pyproject.toml`.
- **Ratchet pattern**: when a bound exists but the codebase has outliers, set the threshold just above the worst and drop it over time (same pattern we use for `--max-warnings` in `ng lint`).
