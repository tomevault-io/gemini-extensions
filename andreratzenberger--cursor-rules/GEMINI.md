  #
  # SECTION 1: TASK MANAGEMENT
  #
  
  - type: react
    conditions:
      - pattern: "task create|task_start"
    action: |
      # Create a new development task
      
      I'll create a new task with:
      - Unique task ID (TASK-YYYY-MM-DD-NN format)
      - Description section
      - Relevant specifications section (linked to `.cursor/specs/` managed by the specification_management rule)
      - Acceptance criteria section
      - Metadata (ID, start date, end date, state)
      - Learnings section for capturing implementation insights
      
      The task will be stored in `.cursor/tasks/` with an Open (📝) status
      and added to the task index in `.cursor/TASKS.md`

  - type: react
    conditions:
      - pattern: "task done|task complete|task_complete"
    action: |
      # Mark a task as complete
      
      I'll update the specified task:
      - Change state to Done (✅)
      - Set end date to current date
      - Extract learnings to a separate file if any exist
      - Mark associated specs as completed
      - Update the task index in `.cursor/TASKS.md`
      
      If the task contains valuable learnings, they'll be saved to 
      `.cursor/learnings/` with proper cross-references and managed by the knowledge_management rule

  - type: react
    conditions:
      - pattern: "task list|task_status"
    action: |
      # List all tasks with their status
      
      I'll generate a table showing:
      - Task ID
      - Current state (Open 📝, Active 🔄, or Done ✅)
      - Task description
      - Start date
      - End date (if completed)
      
      This provides a quick overview of all project tasks and their progress

  - type: react
    conditions:
      - pattern: "task start|task_active"
    action: |
      # Mark a task as active
      
      I'll update the specified task:
      - Change state from Open (📝) to Active (🔄)
      - Update the task index in `.cursor/TASKS.md`
      
      This indicates work has started on this task

  - type: react
    event: "user_request"
    conditions:
      - pattern: "implement|create|build|develop"
    action: |
      # Auto-create task when user requests implementation
      
      When you ask me to implement something, I'll automatically:
      - Create a new task with the implementation request as description
      - Look for related specifications to link to the task (using the specification_management rule)
      - Set the task state to Active (🔄)
      - Add acceptance criteria
      - Create a unique task ID
      - Add the task to the task index
      
      This ensures all implementation work is properly tracked
  
  #
  # SECTION 2: TESTING MANAGEMENT
  #
  
  - type: react
    event: "implementation_start"
    action: |
      # Create test files when implementation begins
      
      When implementation starts, I'll:
      
      1. Find the active task and its associated specifications
      2. For each specification, create appropriate test files:
         - Detect the project type (Node.js, Python, Rust, etc.)
         - Create test files in the proper location and format
         - Link tests to the specification requirements
         - Add placeholder tests for each requirement
         - Include references to the specs and task
      
      3. Consider project-specific testing patterns:
         - Use Jest for JavaScript/TypeScript
         - Use pytest for Python
         - Use Cargo test for Rust
         - Use JUnit for Java
      
      This ensures tests are created before implementation, supporting 
      test-driven development.

  - type: react
    conditions:
      - pattern: "test run|test execute"
    action: |
      # Run tests based on project type
      
      I'll execute tests for the project:
      
      1. Detect the project type:
         - Node.js (package.json) → npm test
         - Rust (Cargo.toml) → cargo test
         - Java (pom.xml) → mvn test
         - Python (requirements.txt/setup.py) → pytest or unittest
      
      2. Process test results:
         - If tests pass, update active task to reflect passing tests
         - If tests fail, create detailed failure report
         - Trigger appropriate success/failure events
      
      3. Update task acceptance criteria:
         - Mark "Unit tests pass" criteria based on results
      
      4. If tests pass, check if README needs updating:
         - Analyze significant code changes
         - Compare with current README content
         - Suggest README updates if needed
      
      This validates implementation quality through automated testing and keeps
      documentation in sync with implementation.

  - type: react
    event: "test_failure"
    action: |
      # Analyze test failures and suggest fixes
      
      When tests fail, I'll:
      
      1. Analyze the failure details:
         - Identify failing tests
         - Determine failure reasons
         - Isolate problematic code
      
      2. Create a learning about the test failure:
         - Document the failure details
         - Record potential solutions
         - Link to relevant code and specifications
      
      3. Store the learning for future reference:
         - Save to `.cursor/learnings/` with proper ID (managed by the knowledge_management rule)
         - Update the learnings index
      
      This captures valuable information from failures and helps prevent 
      similar issues in the future.

  - type: react
    event: "file_change"
    conditions:
      - pattern: "src/.*\\.(js|ts|jsx|tsx|py|rs|go|java|rb|cpp|c|h|hpp)$"
    action: |
      # Check for test files when source files change
      
      When a source file changes, I'll:
      
      1. Extract the component name from the file path
      2. Look for corresponding test files in common locations:
         - tests/[component].test.js
         - tests/test_[component].py
         - tests/[component]_test.rs
         - __tests__/[component].test.js
         - etc.
      
      3. If no test file exists:
         - Make note of missing test coverage
         - Create a reminder to add tests
         - Track untested components
      
      4. Track if the change is significant for README updates:
         - New public API or feature
         - Changed behavior of existing features
         - Removed functionality
         - New configuration options
      
      This ensures all components have corresponding test coverage and 
      tracks changes that might require documentation updates.
  
  #
  # SECTION 3: VERSION CONTROL
  #
  
  - type: react
    conditions:
      - pattern: "file_change|file_save"
    action: |
      # Automatically commit changes using conventional commits format
      
      When a file is changed or saved, I'll:
      1. Determine the appropriate commit type based on the change:
         - `feat`: For new features or functionality
         - `fix`: For bug fixes
         - `docs`: For documentation changes (including specs)
         - `style`: For formatting changes that don't affect code
         - `refactor`: For code restructuring without feature changes
         - `perf`: For performance improvements
         - `test`: For adding or correcting tests
         - `chore`: For maintenance tasks and build changes

      2. Extract scope from the file path (directory structure)
      
      3. Create a commit message in the format: `type(scope): description`
      
      4. For spec files, I'll use the format: `docs(specs): update specifications for <component>`

  - type: react
    event: "build_success"
    action: |
      # When a build succeeds, commit the changes
      
      After a successful build, I'll:
      1. Add all changed files to git staging
      2. Create an appropriate conventional commit message
      3. Check if README needs updating based on the changes
      4. Commit the changes
      
      This ensures all successful builds are properly committed

  - type: react
    event: "test_success"
    action: |
      # When tests pass, commit the changes
      
      After successful tests, I'll:
      1. Add all changed files to git staging
      2. Create a conventional commit message, usually with `test` or `fix` type
      3. Check if README needs updating based on recent changes:
         - Analyze if implemented features are documented in README
         - Compare with README content
         - Flag if README is missing information about new features
      4. Commit the changes
      
      This ensures test-verified changes are committed and documentation
      stays in sync with implementation.

  - type: react
    event: "test_failure"
    action: |
      # When tests fail, don't commit and notify about test failures
      
      If tests fail, I'll:
      1. Not commit the changes
      2. Notify you about the failing tests
      3. Offer to help fix the failing tests
      
      This prevents committing code that doesn't pass tests
  
  #
  # SECTION 4: README MANAGEMENT
  #
  
  - type: react
    conditions:
      - pattern: "readme check|check readme"
    action: |
      # Check if README needs updating
      
      I'll analyze the README file and codebase to identify documentation gaps:
      
      1. Compare README content with actual project features:
         - Look for implemented features not described in README
         - Check if API documentation matches current implementation
         - Verify installation instructions are correct
         - Ensure usage examples reflect current behavior
      
      2. Generate a README validation report:
         - List missing or outdated sections
         - Provide specific update recommendations
         - Prioritize documentation gaps by importance
      
      This helps keep documentation in sync with implementation.

  - type: react
    conditions:
      - pattern: "readme update|update readme"
    action: |
      # Update README to reflect current project state
      
      I'll update the README file to match the current state of the project:
      
      1. Preserve existing structure while adding/updating content:
         - Add missing feature descriptions
         - Update outdated API documentation
         - Refresh installation instructions if needed
         - Update usage examples for changed functionality
      
      2. Generate a commit for the README changes:
         - Use commit type `docs`
         - Include scope `readme`
         - Provide descriptive message about updates
      
      This ensures documentation accurately reflects the current implementation.
  
  #
  # SECTION 5: WORKFLOW INTEGRATION
  #
  
  - type: react
    event: "implementation_complete"
    action: |
      # Integrated workflow when implementation is complete
      
      When implementation is complete, I'll:
      
      1. Run verification tests:
         - Execute tests based on project type
         - Verify all tests pass
      
      2. If tests pass:
         - Update the task status to Done (✅)
         - Set end date to current date
         - Extract and save any learnings (via knowledge_management rule)
         - Mark associated specs as completed (via specification_management rule)
         - Update the task index
         - Check if README needs updating based on implemented features
         - Commit the changes with appropriate message
      
      3. If tests fail:
         - Record verification failure
         - Request fixes before allowing completion
         - Do not commit the changes
      
      This ensures only properly tested implementations are marked complete
      and committed to version control with up-to-date documentation.

      ### Development Workflow System

      Your development process is managed through an integrated workflow:

      **Task Management:**
      - `task create` - Create a new task
      - `task start` - Mark a task as active
      - `task done` - Mark a task as complete
      - `task list` - Show all tasks with status
      - Automatic task creation for implementation requests

      **Testing Framework:**
      - `test run` - Execute tests for the project
      - Automatic test file creation when implementation starts
      - Test coverage verification for source files
      - Test failure analysis and learning capture

      **Version Control:**
      - Automatic commits using conventional format
      - Commit prevention for failing tests
      - Appropriate commit types based on change type
      - Proper scoping based on file structure

      **README Management:**
      - `readme check` - Validate README against current project state
      - `readme update` - Update README to reflect implemented features
      - Automatic README validation after successful tests
      - Documentation kept in sync with implementation

      **Integrated Behaviors:**
      - Implementation request → Create specs → Create task → Create tests → Implement
      - Implementation complete → Run tests → Update task → Check README → Capture learnings → Commit changes
      - Test failure → Analyze issues → Create learnings → Prevent completion

      This system ensures a consistent, high-quality development process from
      task creation through testing to version control, with documentation
      that stays in sync with your codebase.
