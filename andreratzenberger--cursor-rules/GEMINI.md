  # SECTION 1: SPECIFICATION CREATION

  - type: react
    event: "user_request"
    conditions:
      - pattern: "implement|create|build|develop"
    action: |
      # Create specifications before implementation
      
      When you ask me to implement something, I'll:
      
      1. Check if specifications exist for the requested feature
      2. If specifications don't exist:
         - Create a new specification file in `.cursor/specs/`
         - Organize specs by domain/component
         - Define clear requirements as checkable items
         - Add acceptance criteria
         - Link to related specifications if applicable
      3. Update the specifications index `SPECS.md`
      4. Trigger task creation (via development_workflow_system) after specs are created
      
      This ensures all implemented features have proper specifications 
      before development begins.

  - type: react
    conditions:
      - pattern: "spec create|create spec"
    action: |
      # Explicitly create a new specification
      
      I'll create a new specification file:
      
      1. Identify the appropriate domain for the specification
      2. Create the spec file in `.cursor/specs/[domain]/[name].md`
      3. Structure the spec with:
         - Clear title and description
         - Numbered requirements as checkable items
         - Acceptance criteria
         - Notes or context
      4. Update the specifications index `SPECS.md`
      5. Capture any learnings about the specification process (via knowledge_management rule)
      
      This creates a formal specification that can be referenced during development.

  - type: react
    conditions:
      - pattern: "spec update|update spec"
    action: |
      # Update an existing specification
      
      I'll update the specified specification:
      
      1. Find the existing specification file
      2. Add or modify requirements as needed
      3. Update the completion status of requirements
      4. Refresh any related information
      5. Update the specifications index if necessary
      6. Notify the development workflow system of changes (via development_workflow_system)
      
      This ensures specifications stay current as requirements evolve.
  
  #
  # SECTION 2: SPECIFICATION VALIDATION
  #
  
  - type: react
    conditions:
      - pattern: "spec validate|validate spec"
    action: |
      # Validate a specification against quality standards and implementation
      
      I'll perform a comprehensive validation of the specification:
      
      1. Analyze specification quality:
         - Check for vague terms (should, would, could, etc.)
         - Identify non-atomic requirements (multiple requirements in one)
         - Verify all required sections exist (description, requirements, acceptance criteria)
         - Assess overall specification clarity and completeness
      
      2. Validate implementation status:
         - Trace requirements to actual code
         - Check if completed requirements have corresponding implementations
         - Identify discrepancies between spec completion status and actual code
         - Calculate implementation coverage percentage
      
      3. Review test coverage:
         - Look for test files related to this specification
         - Verify test existence for key requirements
         - Identify gaps in test coverage
      
      4. Provide actionable recommendations:
         - Suggest quality improvements
         - Highlight missing implementations
         - Recommend test additions
      
      5. Capture validation learnings (via knowledge_management rule)
      
      The validation report will be saved to `.cursor/output/spec_validation_[filename]_[timestamp].md`

  - type: react
    conditions:
      - pattern: "spec format|format spec"
    action: |
      # Format a specification to improve its quality
      
      I'll improve the specification format:
      
      1. Ensure proper structure:
         - Add title if missing
         - Create standard sections (Description, Requirements, Acceptance Criteria, Notes)
         - Format requirements as proper checkboxes
      
      2. Improve requirement quality:
         - Split non-atomic requirements (containing "and")
         - Convert vague requirements to specific ones
         - Ensure consistent formatting
      
      3. Backup the original specification
      
      This improves specification quality while preserving all original content.

  - type: react
    conditions:
      - pattern: "spec completeness|completeness check"
    action: |
      # Check specification completeness across the project
      
      I'll analyze specification coverage across the entire project:
      
      1. Generate overall statistics:
         - Total specification files
         - Total requirements and completion rate
         - Quality assessment
      
      2. Examine per-specification metrics:
         - Requirements count and completion
         - Quality scores
         - Implementation status
      
      3. Analyze source code coverage:
         - Check which directories/components have specification coverage
         - Identify code areas lacking specifications
         - Calculate coverage percentages
      
      4. Provide recommendations:
         - Areas needing specification improvement
         - Low-quality specifications to address
         - Missing specifications to create
      
      5. Create a learning entry about specification completeness (via knowledge_management rule)
      
      The completeness report will be saved to `.cursor/output/spec_completeness_[timestamp].md`

  - type: react
    event: "file_change"
    conditions:
      - pattern: ".cursor/specs/.*\\.md$"
    action: |
      # Automatically validate specifications when they change
      
      When a specification file changes, I'll:
      
      1. Perform a basic quality check:
         - Look for vague terms
         - Check for missing sections
         - Identify potential quality issues
      
      2. Update the specifications index:
         - Add new specifications to the index
         - Update completion percentages
         - Refresh requirement counts
      
      3. Notify about any quality issues found
      
      4. Update related tasks if needed (via development_workflow_system)
      
      This ensures specifications maintain high quality and are properly indexed.

      ### Specification Management System

      I follow a specification-first approach with built-in quality validation:

      **Specification Creation:**
      - `spec create "Title"` - Create a new specification file
      - `spec update "specs/domain/name.md"` - Update an existing specification
      - Automatic spec creation before implementation

      **Specification Validation:**
      - `spec validate [path/to/spec.md]` - Detailed validation of a specification
      - `spec format [path/to/spec.md]` - Automatically improve specification formatting
      - `spec completeness` - Generate project-wide specification coverage report

      **Automatic Behaviors:**
      - When you ask me to implement something → I'll create specs first
      - When specifications change → They're automatically validated
      - When validation issues are found → I'll suggest improvements
      - When specs are created → Tasks are created (via development workflow)
      - When specs are validated → Learnings are captured (via knowledge management)

      This integrated system ensures all development is driven by high-quality, 
      validated specifications that accurately reflect implementation requirements.

examples:
  # Specification Creation Examples
  - input: |
      spec create "User Authentication System"
    output: "Specification created at .cursor/specs/auth/user_authentication_system.md and added to index."

  - input: |
      Implement a file upload feature
    output: "Before implementation, I'll create specifications for the file upload feature."

  - input: |
      spec update "specs/api/endpoints.md"
    output: "Updated specifications at .cursor/specs/api/endpoints.md with latest requirements."

  # Specification Validation Examples
  - input: |
      spec validate .cursor/specs/auth/login.md
    output: "Specification validation report generated at .cursor/output/spec_validation_login_20250305_123456.md"

      spec format .cursor/specs/api/endpoints.md
    output: "Specification formatted and saved to .cursor/specs/api/endpoints.md"

  - input: |
      spec completeness
    output: "Specification completeness report generated at .cursor/output/spec_completeness_20250305_123456.md"
