This file gives coding agents the working context for OpenBento. Use it with
`CLAUDE.md`, `replit.md`, and the code itself; the code is the source of truth
when docs drift.

## What OpenBento Is

OpenBento is a free, ad-supported, bento-style Mission Control dashboard for
monitoring live streams, personal notes, weather, markets, feeds, utilities, and
small interactive widgets. Users can customize a 12-column dashboard, resize and
move widgets, create multiple dashboard pages, theme the workspace, and
optionally sign in for cross-device cloud sync.

The product is not a SaaS paywall app. Guests can use the dashboard; signing in
only enables sync and library persistence.

## Product Principles

- Keep the dashboard useful immediately for guests.
- Preserve layout and widget state reliably; avoid migrations that discard user
  data from localStorage or cloud sync.
- Prefer focused, practical widgets over broad feature surfaces.
- Make widgets feel native to the dashboard grid: compact, resizable, legible,
  and safe in fullscreen/cast contexts.
- Keep OpenBento fully free and ad-supported. Do not add premium tiers,
  payment processing, locked widgets, usage limits, or paywall logic.
- Ask before major product or data-model changes.

## Repo Structure

- `client/` - React 18 + Vite SPA using Wouter, Tailwind CSS, `@dnd-kit`, and
  Radix/lucide UI pieces.
- `client/src/App.tsx` - top-level providers and route table. It re-exports
  widget types for older imports.
- `client/src/dashboard/dashboard-shell.tsx` - dashboard state owner: auth
  wiring, DnD, add/edit/delete callbacks, localStorage persistence, and cloud
  sync hook usage.
- `client/src/pages/dashboard.tsx` - visual dashboard surface: 12 x 6 grid,
  widget chrome, resize handles, header controls, fullscreen, themes, and
  video-specific controls.
- `client/src/widgets/` - widget data model, renderer registry, and most widget
  implementations.
- `client/src/components/widget-sidebar.tsx` - Block Library, stream presets,
  widget templates, custom widget install flow, and personal stream library.
- `client/src/lib/command-palette-helpers.ts` - command palette command builder,
  including Add Widget commands from widget templates.
- `server/` - Express 5 API server. The same port serves APIs and built client
  assets.
- `server/routes.ts` - main API route file.
- `server/storage.ts` - Drizzle-backed storage operations.
- `shared/` - shared Drizzle models, dashboard page helpers, themes, widget SDK
  protocol, and shared types.
- `shared/dashboard-pages.ts` - pure multi-page dashboard state helpers and
  localStorage key constants.
- `shared/models/` - Drizzle schemas for auth, dashboards, streams, channels,
  feedback, cast, and related records.
- `mobile/` - Expo mobile companion app.

Path aliases:

- `@/` maps to `client/src/`
- `@shared/` maps to `shared/`

## Main Commands

```bash
npm run dev        # Start Express + Vite dev server on port 5000
npm run build      # Build client to dist/public and server to dist/index.cjs
npm run start      # Run production server
npm run check      # TypeScript type checking, no emit
npm run db:push    # Push Drizzle schema changes to PostgreSQL
```

No test runner is configured. Before committing, always run:

```bash
npm run check
npm run build
```

## Widget Architecture

Widget state is persisted as JSON blobs inside dashboard pages. The client-side
widget model lives in `client/src/widgets/shared.tsx`:

- `WidgetType` is the union of valid widget type strings.
- `Widget` is the persisted shape for base layout fields plus per-widget fields.
- Widget type strings must stay lowercase and must exactly match sidebar
  template strings and registry keys.

Rendering is split like this:

- `client/src/widgets/registry.tsx` maps `Widget.type` to a renderer component.
- `client/src/widgets/widget-renderer.tsx` dispatches through the registry and
  shows an Unknown Widget tile for missing types.
- Most widgets live in one file under `client/src/widgets/*-widget.tsx`.
- `video` is special: the registry returns `false`, and
  `client/src/pages/dashboard.tsx` renders `VideoWidget` inline because it needs
  iframe refs, seek mode state, platform controls, and stream-healing behavior.

The Block Library has two relevant sources in
`client/src/components/widget-sidebar.tsx`:

- `WIDGET_TEMPLATES` powers drag/drop templates and command palette Add Widget
  commands.
- `availableWidgets` powers the visible sidebar cards.

If you add a widget, update both when the widget should be visible in both flows.

## How To Add A New Widget Safely

Use the smallest set of files possible:

1. Add the widget type and any persisted fields to
   `client/src/widgets/shared.tsx`.
2. Create the component in `client/src/widgets/<name>-widget.tsx`.
3. Register it in `client/src/widgets/registry.tsx`.
4. Add it to `WIDGET_TEMPLATES` and `availableWidgets` in
   `client/src/components/widget-sidebar.tsx`.
5. Add default values in `addWidget` inside
   `client/src/dashboard/dashboard-shell.tsx` only if the widget needs defaults
   beyond the base widget fields.
6. If the widget should appear in starter experiences, update
   `client/src/data/starter-packs.ts`.
7. If the widget needs command palette keywords beyond the template defaults,
   update `client/src/lib/command-palette-helpers.ts`.

Prefer storing widget settings on the `Widget` object and updating them through
the existing `onUpdate(widgetId, patch)` pattern. Keep payloads JSON-serializable.
Avoid storing transient UI-only state in the persisted widget object unless it
must survive reloads or cloud sync.

For data-fetching widgets, prefer a small server proxy with caching when the
browser would expose secrets, hit CORS problems, or duplicate expensive calls.

## Layout Persistence Rules

`DashboardShell` owns the page collection and widget array. The active page's
widgets are exposed as `widgets`/`setWidgets` for child components, but the real
source of truth is the multi-page state.

LocalStorage keys are defined in `shared/dashboard-pages.ts`:

- `openBentoPages` - current multi-page dashboard state.
- `openBentoActivePageId` - last active page.
- `openBentoWidgets` - legacy active-page widget mirror used for backward
  compatibility and older code paths.

Hydration order:

1. Try `openBentoPages`.
2. Fall back to legacy `openBentoWidgets`.
3. Create an empty Home page.

Do not remove the legacy mirror casually. Cast snapshots and older paths may
still rely on it. When changing persisted shapes, use defensive sanitizing and
backward-compatible defaults so old dashboards keep loading.

The Save button in `client/src/pages/dashboard.tsx` is mostly a visual affordance.
Layout persistence is automatic when page state changes.

## Cloud Sync Rules

Cloud sync lives in `client/src/dashboard/use-cloud-sync.ts` and uses
`/api/dashboard` with a Supabase bearer token.

- Guests use localStorage only.
- Signed-in users hydrate once from `GET /api/dashboard`.
- After hydration, page-state changes are debounced and uploaded with
  `POST /api/dashboard`.
- The payload includes `pages`, `activePageId`, and a legacy `widgets` mirror of
  the active page.
- Network failures should silently preserve local state.
- Do not make cloud sync depend on premium status or payment state.

The dashboard table is defined in `shared/models/streams.ts`. It stores JSONB
`widgets`, `pages`, theme fields, and metadata. Use `npm run db:push` for schema
changes; this repo does not use migrations.

## Backend Route Caution

Most API routes are currently centralized in `server/routes.ts`. Keep additions
small and well-scoped:

- Reuse existing service/cache patterns where possible.
- Validate inputs with Zod or simple explicit checks.
- Never expose server-side API keys to the client.
- Add rate limits, TTL caches, or dedupe behavior for external APIs that may be
  slow, quota-limited, or expensive.
- Preserve auth boundaries: admin routes are gated by admin email, dashboard
  cloud sync uses Supabase bearer auth, and feedback remains public.
- Avoid broad route refactors unless the task explicitly calls for them.

## Security And Secrets

- Do not commit secrets, API keys, tokens, `.env` contents, database URLs, or
  private credentials.
- Client-exposed variables must use the existing `VITE_` pattern and be safe for
  browsers.
- Server-only secrets must stay server-only.
- Be careful with custom widget URLs and iframe behavior; keep sandbox and
  postMessage validation intact.

## Change Discipline

- Keep changes focused on the user's request.
- Do not rewrite unrelated architecture or formatting.
- Do not revert unrelated user changes in the working tree.
- Prefer existing patterns over new abstractions.
- Keep new widget UI responsive inside small grid cells and fullscreen mode.
- For risky UI changes, verify in the browser when practical.
- Before commit, run `npm run check` and `npm run build`.
