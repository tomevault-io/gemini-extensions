## Live Sync Contract — Non-Negotiable

Peekaboo is a local-first SwiftData app whose Mac and iPhone targets synchronize
through the same private CloudKit database. Live two-way sync is a core product
feature, not an optional integration. Never merge, archive, upload, or install a
sync-related change unless every invariant and release check below remains true.

### Mandatory identifiers and environments

- Both targets MUST use bundle identifier `com.emanueledipietro.Peekaboo`.
- Both targets MUST use CloudKit container
  `iCloud.com.emanueledipietro.Peekaboo`.
- Release/TestFlight builds MUST use CloudKit `Production` and production APNs.
- Debug and Local builds MUST use CloudKit `Development` and development APNs.
- `ICLOUD_CONTAINER_ENVIRONMENT` and `APS_ENVIRONMENT` MUST always describe the
  same environment. Never mix Production CloudKit with development APNs.
- Development and Production MUST NOT share a SQLite store. Production uses the
  default SwiftData store; Development uses `development.store`.
- Never point a Debug/Local build at the Production store, and never install a
  development-signed archive as a substitute for the TestFlight Mac build when
  validating production sync.

### Mandatory macOS entitlements

Every macOS configuration (`Peekaboo.entitlements`,
`PeekabooDebug.entitlements`, and `PeekabooLocal.entitlements`) MUST NOT contain
`com.apple.security.temporary-exception.mach-lookup.global-name`, including the
values `com.apple.cloudd` and `com.apple.duetactivityscheduler`.

- Apple rejected Mac build 15 under guideline 2.4.5(i) and explicitly stated
  that these temporary exceptions are not appropriate and will not be granted.
- Do not reintroduce either temporary exception during sync debugging, cleanup,
  security review, or release prep.
- The Mac app MUST keep network client/server, CloudKit container, iCloud
  service, production/development APNs, and App Sandbox entitlements intact.
- CloudKit sync must work through Apple's standard iCloud capabilities without
  direct temporary access to internal Mach services.
- The Mac target MUST link `CloudKit.framework` explicitly. SwiftData and Core
  Data access CloudKit dynamically, which can leave the framework absent from a
  standalone Release binary and prevent App Sandbox from granting standard
  CloudKit service access.

Incident record: Mac build 8 exposed a sync scheduling failure when
`com.apple.duetactivityscheduler` was absent. Build 15 restored both temporary
exceptions, but App Review refused them. Any recurrence must now be fixed using
supported APIs and verified with a real TestFlight two-way sync; the temporary
exceptions must not be restored.

### Persistence and observation invariants

- Keep `NSApplication.shared.registerForRemoteNotifications()` on macOS.
- Keep `UIApplication.registerForRemoteNotifications()` on iPhone so silent
  CloudKit pushes can wake a suspended app and schedule an import.
- Keep the bounded `ProcessInfo` activity assertion around macOS local
  save-to-export and import-to-refresh windows. Peekaboo is an `LSUIElement`
  app and can otherwise enter App Nap while Core Data is still mirroring. The
  assertion must remain event-driven, allow idle system sleep, and retain its
  timeout; never replace it with permanent activity or polling.
- Keep both `NSPersistentStoreRemoteChange` and
  `NSPersistentCloudKitContainer.eventChangedNotification` observation.
- On a completed CloudKit import, replace the long-lived `ModelContext` with a
  fresh context before fetching. A normal fetch on the cached context can keep
  stale values visible and can write them back over imported changes.
- Keep foreground, wake, day-change, time-zone-change, and panel-reveal refresh
  fallbacks. They may refresh local state; they are not a replacement for a
  functioning CloudKit import/export pipeline.
- Do not add aggressive polling. Sync and UI refresh MUST stay event-driven to
  avoid CPU spikes.
- SwiftData models used by CloudKit MUST remain CloudKit-compatible: properties
  need defaults or optionality, and app UUIDs MUST NOT use a SwiftData unique
  constraint that CloudKit cannot enforce.
- CloudKit can contain multiple physical records with the same app-level UUID.
  Deduplicate only for presentation. Never delete an arbitrary duplicate during
  refresh. Mutations and deletion MUST apply to every physical replica of the
  selected app UUID.
- Done-task cleanup MUST use `completedAt` relative to the start of the current
  local day. `updatedAt` must not keep a task completed on a previous day alive.
  A divergent duplicate must prevent destructive cleanup until replicas agree.
- Never delete, reset, migrate, or replace the user's production store or
  CloudKit container as a debugging shortcut without explicit user approval.

### Known failure signatures

Treat these as real failures until disproved:

- `BGSystemTaskSchedulerErrorDomain Code=3`, `updateTaskRequest failed`, or
  repeated `com.apple.coredata.cloudkit.activity.export...` scheduling errors.
  Verify that the Release executable links `CloudKit.framework`, then verify the
  standard iCloud entitlements, installed TestFlight build, active store, and
  CloudKit startup/export events. Do not add temporary Mach lookup exceptions
  as a workaround.
- Phone-to-phone sync works but Mac does not: inspect the installed Mac build,
  Production entitlements, active store path, CloudKit event timestamps, and
  fresh-context import refresh.
- Mac exports succeed but a backgrounded iPhone does not import: verify the
  installed iPhone build has production APNs, the `remote-notification`
  background mode, explicit APNs registration, and a new import event after the
  server change. A force-quit or locked/unavailable test device cannot prove
  live delivery; foreground it once before diagnosing the data layer.
- A task appears in `default.store` but no later export event appears in
  `ANSCKEVENT`: the Mac mirroring/export scheduler is broken. UI refresh code
  cannot fix it.
- Import/export setup events succeed with zero objects, then no event follows a
  local mutation: do not report sync as healthy.
- Data exists in SQLite but not in the panel: inspect stale `ModelContext`
  handling and completed-import refresh before changing CloudKit configuration.
- Multiple installed/running Peekaboo copies can use different builds or
  environments. Confirm the exact executable with `pgrep -fl Peekaboo`, the
  bundle version, code signature, entitlements, and opened store before testing.

### Required verification after any sync, persistence, signing, or release change

Build success and unit tests are insufficient. Complete all of the following:

1. Regenerate `Peekaboo.xcodeproj` from `Scripts/generate_project.rb` and run
   `Scripts/verify_project_generation.rb`.
2. Inspect the archived AND installed app entitlements with `codesign`. Confirm
   Production CloudKit/APNs and confirm that no temporary Mach lookup exception
   is present in the TestFlight Mac app.
3. Inspect the archived AND installed executable with `otool -L` and confirm
   that `CloudKit.framework` is linked.
4. Confirm only the intended Peekaboo build is running and record its bundle
   version. Do not accidentally test DerivedData or an old `/Applications` copy.
5. Use real TestFlight builds on a real Mac and real iPhone signed into the same
   iCloud account. Simulator or development-only success does not prove
   Production live sync.
6. Mac → iPhone: create or edit a uniquely named task on Mac. Verify that a new
   CloudKit export event occurs after the mutation and that the change appears
   on iPhone without restarting either app.
7. iPhone → Mac: edit that task on iPhone. Verify a new import event and that the
   visible Mac panel updates without restarting or repeatedly clicking refresh.
8. Repeat with priority and status changes, including Done and restore, because
   field updates previously exposed stale-context behavior.
9. Delete the diagnostic task only after both directions pass, and verify that
   the deletion also synchronizes.

If any step fails, the release is blocked. Do not call sync fixed, do not upload
another replacement build, and do not modify entitlements speculatively. Capture
the installed entitlements, store path, latest CloudKit events, and exact
one-way failure before making the next change.

### Release discipline

- Increment the platform build number before every App Store Connect upload;
  uploaded build numbers cannot be reused.
- Keep the Xcode project generator as the source of truth for build numbers,
  environments, signing settings, targets, and shared sources.
- Deploy the SwiftData/CloudKit schema to Production before TestFlight builds
  depend on new fields.
- Upload Mac and iPhone independently and wait until each build is processed and
  assigned to the intended internal TestFlight group.
- Install the distributed TestFlight Mac build before validating sync. An
  archive signed for development can have different APNs behavior.
- Never “fix” CloudKit scheduler errors by suppressing logs or removing sandbox
  exceptions. Prove an export after a local save instead.

Keep this entire Live Sync Contract synchronized verbatim between the root
`AGENTS.md` and `claude.md`. Any deliberate change to these invariants requires
a written reason and a successful real-device two-way sync verification.

## Model Selection

Rankings, higher = better. Cost reflects what I actually pay (OpenAI is near-free for me due to a deal), not list price. Intelligence is how hard a problem you can hand the model unsupervised. Taste covers UI/UX, code quality, API design, and copy.

| model | cost | intelligence | taste |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| gpt-5.6-sol | 9 | 8 | 5 |
| sonnet-5 | 5 | 5 | 7 |
| opus-4.8 | 4 | 7 | 8 |
| fable-5 | 2 | 9 | 9 |

How to apply:

- These are defaults, not limits. You have standing permission to override them: if a cheaper model's output doesn't meet the bar, rerun or redo the work with a smarter model without asking. Judge the output, not the price tag. Escalating costs less than shipping mediocre work.
- Cost is a tie-breaker only; when axes conflict for anything that ships, intelligence > taste > cost.
- Don't let cost prevent you from using the right model for the job. Instead, take advantage of cheaper options to get more information and try things before moving the work to a more expensive option.
- Bulk/mechanical work (clear-spec implementation, data analysis, migrations): gpt-5.6-sol — it's effectively free.
- Anything user-facing (UI, copy, API design) needs taste ≥ 7.
- Reviews of plans/implementations: fable-5 or opus-4.8, optionally gpt-5.6-sol as an extra independent perspective.
- Never use Haiku.
- Mechanics: gpt-5.6-sol is only reachable through the Codex CLI — `codex exec` / `codex review` (my `~/.codex/config.toml` defaults to gpt-5.6-sol). Use the codex-implementation, codex-review, and codex-computer-use skills; for work they don't cover (investigation, data analysis), run `codex exec -s read-only` directly with a self-contained prompt.
- Claude models (sonnet-5, opus-4.8, fable-5) run via the Agent/Workflow model parameter.

Using gpt-5.5 inside workflows and subagents (the model parameter only takes Claude models, so use a wrapper):

- Spawn a thin Claude wrapper agent with `model: 'sonnet', effort: 'low'` whose prompt instructs it to write a self-contained codex prompt, run `codex exec` via Bash, and return the report (use `schema` on the wrapper to get structured output back).
- Always label these agents with a `gpt-5.6-sol:` prefix, e.g. `{label: 'gpt-5.6-sol:review-auth'}` — the workflow UI shows the wrapper's Claude model, so the label is the only indication the real worker is gpt-5.6-sol.
- Codex runs can exceed Bash's 10-minute timeout: pass an explicit timeout, or run in the background and poll for the report file.
- Parallel gpt-5.6-sol implementation agents must use `isolation: 'worktree'` so codex edits don't collide in the shared checkout.
- Workflow token budgets only count Claude tokens; codex work is free and invisible to `budget.spent()`.

## Long-running Codex Work

gpt-5.6-sol is exceptionally capable on long-running tasks. Give it substantial, multi-step work when it is the right model for the job; do not split work up merely because it is large.

- The quality of the result depends on the prompt. Provide a detailed, self-contained brief: goal, relevant context, constraints, files or systems in scope, expected deliverables, and how to verify completion.
- State important decisions and non-negotiable requirements explicitly. Do not assume the model will infer project-specific conventions or the desired tradeoffs from a short prompt.
- For long tasks, ask it to inspect the current state first, execute the work end to end, and report the changes, verification, and any remaining risks.
- If the work can safely run in parallel, keep each task's ownership and worktree boundaries explicit so agents do not overlap.
