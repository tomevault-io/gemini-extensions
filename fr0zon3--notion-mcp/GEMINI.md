# easy-notion-mcp

Markdown-first Notion MCP server. Agents write markdown, the server converts it to Notion's block API. Agents never touch Notion block objects directly.

## Open source context

**This is open source software** (MIT-licensed, published to npm as `easy-notion-mcp` and on GitHub as `Grey-Iris/easy-notion-mcp`). Commits, PR bodies, issue responses, and diffs become part of the public record — they are cited back at the project, not just read. That should shape how you work on this repo:

- **Security claims are load-bearing.** If CI allowlists a CVE as "not exploitable" or a commit claims "we don't use the vulnerable code path," that claim needs to be grounded in actual file:line evidence from the code paths involved, not in reasoning from what we import. When in doubt, patch rather than whitelist — users install this server and hand it their Notion workspace token, so "theoretically safe" is not the bar.
- **Upstream-first for transitive fixes.** If a root cause lives in a dependency (e.g. `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` pulling a vulnerable `hono`), file an issue or PR upstream alongside any local patch. Local overrides are a short-term workaround; upstream fixes help the whole ecosystem and reduce our long-term exception list.
- **Downstream consumers exist.** People install via `npx easy-notion-mcp`, wrap us in other MCP clients, or depend on us as a library. Consider how changes to `package.json`, `exports`, `bin`, default behavior, and tool schemas affect them — not just our own CI.
- **PR scope discipline.** Keep PRs narrowly scoped so reviewers and future auditors can tell what changed and why. Don't bundle unrelated fixes into a docs PR, don't let chores leak into feature branches. Semantic titles, focused diffs.
- **Honest positioning.** Avoid marketing superlatives in README/docs. Soften unverifiable comparisons, cite real numbers, and match the existing measured tone.

### Screening `.meta/` files before commit

Handoffs, audits, and plans under `.meta/` are public by default. That's the right default — transparency is a feature, and agent portability requires these files to travel with the repo rather than living local-only. But before committing any `.meta/handoffs/*.md` or `.meta/audits/*.md` file, run a 30-second screen:

1. **Third parties by name or specific role?** ("James's co-founder", "client X asked for Y", "$VENDOR's support said Z"). If yes: generalize to a role-less description, get consent, or move that specific file to a gitignored `.meta/handoffs-private/` path.
2. **Business, financial, or client information?** Deal terms, pricing, customer lists, revenue, internal roadmap items not yet announced.
3. **Credentials or secrets, even partially redacted.** Never commit them, even with `[REDACTED]`.
4. **Tone you wouldn't want cited back in six months.** Self-deprecation is fine and often valuable; gratuitous snark about a maintainer or project isn't.

If any item fails the screen, stop and ask the user before committing. The default is still public — screening is a filter, not a rejection. The goal is to keep the honest writing that makes handoffs valuable while catching the rare detail that shouldn't go out.

## Commands

```bash
npm run build       # tsc → dist/
npm test            # vitest
npm run dev         # tsc --watch
node dist/index.js  # stdio server (needs NOTION_TOKEN)
node dist/http.js   # HTTP server (needs OAuth creds or NOTION_TOKEN)
npm run start:http  # same as above
```

CI runs on every PR and push to `main`/`dev` (GitHub Actions: build, typecheck, test on Node 20 + 22). The package requires Node >=20 (`engines`).

## Releasing

CI Trusted Publishing is the primary path. Pushing a `v*` tag triggers `.github/workflows/release.yml`, which runs build/typecheck/test, publishes to npm via OIDC (no `NPM_TOKEN` required), and creates the GitHub release. Total runtime is under a minute when green.

1. Bump `version` in **all three** of `package.json`, `package-lock.json` (top-level `version` field AND `packages."".version`), and `server.json` (the MCP Registry manifest; bump BOTH its top-level `version` field AND `packages[0].version`) in the same commit (a CI drift-guard test, `tests/server-version.test.ts`, fails the build if `server.json` and `package.json` versions diverge, so all three files must move together)
2. Commit: `git commit -am "chore: bump to vX.Y.Z"`
3. Tag: `git tag vX.Y.Z`
4. Push: `git push public dev && git push public --tags`
5. Watch the Release workflow run (`gh run watch` or the Actions tab). It should succeed end-to-end: `npm publish --provenance` via Trusted Publishing, then `gh release create` from inside the workflow.
6. Verify npm picked up the new version: `curl -s https://registry.npmjs.org/easy-notion-mcp/latest | jq -r .version` (avoid `npm view`, which can return stale local-cached data for several minutes).
7. Merge `main` ← release PR, then `dev` ← `main` catch-up merge.

### Manual fallback

Use the manual path when CI is unavailable, the npm registry is rejecting OIDC, or you deliberately want to publish from local state. Steps 1-4 above are unchanged; replace step 5 with:

1. `npm login --auth-type=web` (if the session is expired)
2. `npm publish --access public` from the tagged commit
3. `npm run release:smoke` (post-publish verification)
4. `gh release create vX.Y.Z --generate-notes`

The Release workflow previously failed because it ran on Node 20 (npm 10), but Trusted Publishing requires npm ≥ 11.5.1 (Node 22.14+ or 24). Commit `e06e2ee` bumped the workflow to Node 24; v0.9.1 was the first release published end-to-end via Trusted Publishing.

```

- `server.ts` exports `createServer(notionClientFactory, config)` — a factory that builds an MCP Server with the tool definitions registered from `src/server.ts`
<!-- Maintainer: canonical tool list lives in the tool definitions array in src/server.ts. Avoid hardcoding counts here. -->
- `index.ts` is a thin stdio entry point: creates one Notion client, passes it to `createServer`, connects via `StdioServerTransport`
- `http.ts` exports `createApp(options)` — builds an Express app with MCP endpoints; supports two modes:
  - **Static token mode**: uses a fixed `NOTION_TOKEN`, no auth middleware
  - **OAuth mode**: mounts `mcpAuthRouter` for `.well-known/*`, `/authorize`, `/token`, `/register`; protects `/mcp` with bearer auth; relays OAuth to Notion
- `createApp` is imported directly by integration tests (no server startup needed)
- `GET /` on the HTTP server returns a health check JSON (`{"status":"ok","server":"easy-notion-mcp","transport":"streamable-http","endpoint":"/mcp"}`)
- `find_replace` and `replace_content` use Notion's native markdown API via `pages.updateMarkdown`, rather than the GFM-to-blocks pipeline used by the other page content tools
- All logging goes to `console.error` (stdout is reserved for MCP protocol in stdio mode)

## Environment

### Stdio mode (default)
- `NOTION_TOKEN` (required) — Notion internal integration token
- `NOTION_ROOT_PAGE_ID` (optional) — default parent page
- `NOTION_TRUST_CONTENT` (optional) — skip content notice prefix
- `NOTION_MCP_WORKSPACE_ROOT` (optional, stdio only) — absolute path that bounds file_path inputs for the `create_page_from_file` tool. Defaults to the server's process.cwd(). Has no effect in HTTP mode.

### HTTP mode
- `NOTION_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` + `NOTION_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` — enables OAuth mode
- `NOTION_TOKEN` — fallback for static token mode (no OAuth)
- `PORT` (default: 3333) — HTTP server port
- `OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI` (default: http://localhost:{PORT}/callback)

### Bench mode
- `BENCH_ROOT_PAGE_ID` (optional) -- parent page for bench scenario sandboxes. Falls back to `E2E_ROOT_PAGE_ID` if not set.

## Custom markdown conventions

Notion has block types with no standard markdown equivalent. We use these conventions:

| Notion block | Markdown syntax |
|---|---|
| Toggle (collapsible) | `+++ Title\ncontent\n+++` |
| Toggle heading H1 (collapsible) | `+++ # Title\ncontent\n+++` |
| Toggle heading H2 (collapsible) | `+++ ## Title\ncontent\n+++` |
| Toggle heading H3 (collapsible) | `+++ ### Title\ncontent\n+++` |
| Column layout | `::: columns\n::: column\ncontent\n:::\n:::` |
| Callout (note) | `> [!NOTE]\n> text` |
| Callout (tip) | `> [!TIP]\n> text` |
| Callout (warning) | `> [!WARNING]\n> text` |
| Callout (important) | `> [!IMPORTANT]\n> text` |
| Callout (info) | `> [!INFO]\n> text` |
| Callout (success) | `> [!SUCCESS]\n> text` |
| Callout (error) | `> [!ERROR]\n> text` |
| Equation | `$$expression$$` or multi-line `$$\nexpression\n$$` |
| Table of contents | `[toc]` |
| Embed | `[embed](url)` |
| Bookmark (rich preview) | Bare URL on its own line |
| Page mention | `@[Title](url)` |
| Task list | `- [ ] unchecked` / `- [x] checked` |

These round-trip cleanly: `read_page` outputs the same conventions that `create_page` accepts.

## Adding a new block type

1. **markdown-to-blocks.ts** — Add a case in the token walker to recognize the new syntax and produce the Notion block object
2. **blocks-to-markdown.ts** — Add a case to convert the Notion block type back to markdown
3. **tests/** — Add tests for both directions (markdown → blocks and blocks → markdown)
4. **server.ts** — Update the `create_page` tool description to document the new syntax
5. **CLAUDE.md** — Add a row to the "Custom markdown conventions" table above so future contributors and agents know the syntax exists. This is the one exception to CONTRIBUTING.md rule #4's "do not modify CLAUDE.md without pre-approval" — block-type additions are pre-approved by this checklist.

## Key decisions

- **`marked`** for markdown parsing (nested token tree, bundled TS types, simpler than remark/unified)
- **`@notionhq/client` v5.20.x** — matches Notion-Version: 2026-03-11
- **Markdown as the interface** — agents never construct Notion block objects. This keeps tool usage simple and lets the conversion logic evolve independently
- **Database entry conversion** — fetches database schema at runtime to correctly map simple key-value pairs to Notion property format
- **Schema caching** — database schemas are cached in-memory with a 5-minute TTL to avoid redundant API calls during batch operations
- **`createServer` factory pattern** — decouples server setup from transport; in stdio mode the factory always returns the same client; in HTTP OAuth mode it returns a per-user client based on auth token
- **OAuth relay** — the server acts as an MCP OAuth Authorization Server, redirects to Notion's OAuth consent screen, exchanges codes, and issues its own bearer tokens backed by encrypted file-based storage (AES-256-GCM)
- **Transport-conditional tools** — tools can declare a `transports: ['stdio' | 'http']` list to restrict where they appear. Tools without the field are available in all transports. File-reading tools (e.g. `create_page_from_file`) are stdio-only because HTTP-mode callers don't share the server's filesystem.
- **Non-fatal `warnings` field on tool responses** — tools may return an optional `warnings: Array<{code: string, ...detail}>` for non-fatal data-fidelity concerns (e.g., `omitted_block_types` on `read_page`). Omitted when empty. Codes are part of the contract once shipped — new tools should reuse existing codes or add specific descriptive names.

## `.meta/research/` lifecycle

Research notes under `.meta/research/` have a 90-day shelf life. If a research note has not been referenced by a merged plan, an active doc, or a tasuku task within 90 days of its creation, delete it. Check creation date via `git log --diff-filter=A --format=%ai -- <file>`. This rule is forward-looking only — do not retroactively purge existing notes when this rule is added.


## Learnings

- Workflow-construction standard for this repo (2026-06-12, James): (1) MODEL — Opus by default for all workflow agent() calls; use model:'sonnet' ONLY where measuring discoverability/legibility-to-a-typical-user (Sonnet is an instrument there, not a cost-saver). (2) CODEX — Workflow agent() spawns Claude subagents only; Codex enters via a workflow agent dispatching sync 'mcp-cli run --agent codex' (the builder.md pattern, = the through-a-PM governance rule). Strong fit: code-read/contract-audit + cross-model verify. Poor fit: live-MCP empirical streams (a Codex mcp-cli sub-session lacks this session's easy-notion MCP). (3) ROLES — reuse ../workflow-v2 roles (builder/audit/red-team/planner) via Codex sub-dispatch --role <name> (registry confirmed reachable) + role guidance inlined in the managing Claude agent's prompt; verify whether agent() agentType can natively load them before wiring. Apply this fully on the 1.0 EXECUTION-phase workflow, not by re-running completed recon.
