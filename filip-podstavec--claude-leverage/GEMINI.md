# Code conventions (full)

The always-on essentials live in [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) ("Code
conventions"). This file holds the depth an agent only needs when actually
writing code in a given area — kept here, surfaced on demand, so the root
instruction file stays lean (see
[ADR 0009](adr/0009-agents-md-lean-budget-and-size-tiers.md)).

These conventions apply to code you ship in this repo AND are what the stack
documents for other repos via
[`templates/AGENTS.md.example`](../templates/AGENTS.md.example).

## Naming

The inline rule is `Name to fit in` (`AGENTS.md` → "Write less, fit in"). The
discipline behind it, and why it is detect-and-conform rather than a house style,
is in [ADR 0010](adr/0010-naming-detect-and-conform-over-house-style.md). The
mechanics:

**Casing / separator — detect, then conform.** There is no stack-wide "correct"
style; the correct style is whatever the surrounding code already uses. A model's
language default (Python → `snake_case`, JS → `camelCase`) is a *prior*, not a
license to impose. Before naming anything new:

- **Scan first.** Look at sibling files and nearby identifiers of the *same kind*
  to read off the convention. `grep` a few existing definitions if unsure.
- **Match per kind.** Casing legitimately differs by kind even within one repo —
  `PascalCase` types, `camelCase`/`snake_case` functions and locals,
  `UPPER_SNAKE` constants, `kebab-case` files/CLI flags. Conform each kind to its
  own neighbours, not to a single global rule.
- **Local over global.** In a repo with inconsistent history, match the *local
  module* you're editing over the repo-wide majority — fitting the immediate
  context beats a "correct" name that clashes with everything around it.
- **Idioms only if the repo uses them.** Predicate prefixes (`is_`/`has_`/
  `should_`), hungarian-ish suffixes, `_async` markers, etc. — adopt them only
  when the surrounding code already does. Don't import a convention the repo
  never chose.

**Granularity / clarity — universal.** Independent of the repo, a name states
intent at the right altitude:

- **Too vague** (`get()`, `data()`, `handle()`, `process()`, `tmp`) forces the
  reader to open the body to learn what it does.
- **Too verbose / leaking** (`getting_data_from_mobile()`,
  `user_list_array_final2`) bakes implementation detail or history into the name,
  so it reads as noise and goes stale when the internals change.
- **Right** names the *what/why* at the call site's level of abstraction:
  `fetch_mobile_profile()`, `pending_invoices`, `is_expired`. If a good name is
  hard to find, the unit is often doing too much — that's a design signal, not a
  naming problem.

                              registers every *.md as a phantom — see

                              that motivated the v1.0 pivot. Don't delete.
```

## AIDEV-* anchor deadlines (optional)

`AIDEV-TODO` and `AIDEV-QUESTION` accept an optional ISO-8601 deadline:

```python
# AIDEV-TODO(by: 2026-08-01): replace the polling loop with webhooks
# AIDEV-QUESTION(by: 2026-07-15): is the encoding always UTF-8 here?
```

`/stack-check`'s anchor walk parses the date and reports overdue items
separately from age-based "stale" items, so deadlines have actual teeth.
Without a deadline, the same anchor falls under the age-based check
(fresh / aging / stale at 30 / 90 days).

## Structured JSON-lines logging

For application code that emits logs an agent will later need to read:

```json
{"ts":"2026-05-24T12:34:56.789Z","level":"info","trace_id":"a1b2c3","span_id":"4d5e6f","service":"billing","event":"invoice_paid","attrs":{"invoice_id":"inv_789","amount_cents":4900}}
```

Required fields: `ts` (ISO-8601 UTC), `level`, `trace_id`, `span_id`, `service`,
`event` (snake_case), `attrs` (typed object).

**Do not interpolate values into messages.** Put `user_id` in `attrs.user_id`,
not in the `message` string. Propagate `trace_id` across process/HTTP/queue
boundaries (W3C traceparent header). Per-language starter kits live in
[`templates/logging/`](../templates/logging/).

## Per-directory AGENTS.md for non-trivial modules

When a module has non-obvious public surface or gotchas, add an `AGENTS.md` at
its root. Codex merges nested AGENTS.md files from git root down to cwd
automatically; Claude Code picks them up when an agent Reads the file. Use
`/init-repo` to drop one into a fresh project, or copy
[`templates/AGENTS.md.example`](../templates/AGENTS.md.example) directly.

## When to invoke `/adr-new` and `/session-log`

These two skills are the durable-memory layer (see
[ADR 0004](adr/0004-adr-and-session-log-are-user-invoked-no-auto-fire-hook.md)
for why they don't auto-fire). They are **user/agent-invoked**, not hooked to a
lifecycle event. **The agent working in this repo is expected to recognize the
moment** and invoke. Specifically:

- **`/adr-new`** — invoke when a load-bearing architectural decision is being
  made or has just been made in conversation. "Load-bearing" means: someone is
  likely to propose reverting it in six months ("why didn't we use X?") without
  seeing the rationale. Examples that warrant an ADR: choosing a database /
  framework / integration pattern / auth model, OR explicit rejection of an
  alternative. Three sentences in `docs/adr/NNNN.md` is cheaper than re-arguing
  later.

- **`/session-log`** — invoke at the END of a substantial working session
  (commits shipped, multiple non-trivial decisions made, or open questions
  surfaced worth preserving). Signals to watch for: user says "thanks, that's it
  for today" / "tomorrow" / "wrap this up"; OR session shipped 3+ commits with
  no session log yet today; OR user asks for a summary / handoff / status.
  Distillate, NOT transcript.

Both skills' descriptions follow a `USE WHEN ... / Do NOT use for ...` pattern so
the Claude Code skill resolver surfaces them when the conversation matches the
trigger. But the agent **must still recognize the moment** — neither skill is
fired by a hook. If you forget, the plugin won't remind you (per ADR 0004).

## Module organization

- Co-locate tests with code (`foo.py` next to `foo_test.py`)
- One concept per module, thin entrypoint exporting the public surface
- Predictable file layout, documented in `AGENTS.md`
- Reference canonical examples by path ("see `agents/flaky-test-isolator.md` for
  the read-only-subagent pattern") rather than restating conventions
