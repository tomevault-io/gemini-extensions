# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This project is a Vue 3 + TypeScript + Three.js Pokemon card viewer with GLSL shaders.

## Commands

```bash
bun dev              # Start Vite dev server with HMR
bun run build        # Type-check (vue-tsc) + production build (Vite)
bun run lint         # Run oxlint + eslint with auto-fix
bun run format       # Prettier on src/
bun test:unit        # Run all unit tests (includes shader tests)
bun test:assets      # Verify texture files match set JSON (optional — needs local assets)
bun test:shader      # Run shader compilation and validation tests
bun test:e2e         # Playwright end-to-end tests
```

**Do NOT use bare `bun test`** — it invokes Bun's built-in test runner which lacks Vite's `@/` path aliases, `vite-plugin-glsl` imports, and Playwright's test harness. Always use the specific commands above (`bun test:unit`, `bun test:shader`, `bun test:e2e`).

To run a single test file: `bunx vitest run path/to/test.ts`
To filter by test name: `bunx vitest run -t "test name pattern"`

## Architecture

Pokebox is a Vue 3 + Three.js app that creates a parallax "window into a box" effect using real-time face tracking. The webcam tracks the user's head position and adjusts an off-axis perspective camera so the screen appears as a physical window into a 3D scene containing holographic Pokémon cards.

### Rendering pipeline

1. **Face tracking** (`useFaceTracking`) polls MediaPipe for head position → writes to `store.targetEye`
2. **Scene loop** (`useThreeScene.animate`) smoothly interpolates eye position, computes off-axis projection matrix; delegates per-frame uniform updates to `ShaderUniformUpdater` and fan animation to `FanAnimator`
3. **Off-axis camera** maps real-world eye coordinates to an asymmetric frustum so the 3D scene responds to head movement
4. **Card shaders** — Each card uses one of several holo shader types, automatically selected based on card type:
   - **Illustration Rare** (`illustration-rare.frag`): Multiple vertical rainbow bands with diagonal bars + glare, matching Pokémon illustration rare holo cards
   - **Regular Holo** (`regular-holo.frag`): Diagonal rainbow gradient with rotating bar patterns + layered radial glare, matching standard holo cards
   - **Special Illustration Rare** (`special-illustration-rare.frag`): Diagonal rainbow + fine line texture + three iridescent texture layers (iri-7, iri-8, iri-9) with pointer-responsive shifts + derived-gradient sparkle on etch relief that uses dFdx/dFdy of the foil texture as pseudo surface normals so sparkle bands follow embossed contours rather than sweeping in straight lines, with iri-1/iri-2 textures for per-texel variation, matching special illustration rare cards with silvery holographic finish. See `docs/shaders/special-illustration-rare.md`.
   - **Double Rare** (`double-rare.frag`): Birthday holo with grain texture, dual dank textures, and tilt-revealed sparkles
   - **Ultra Rare** (`ultra-rare.frag`): Metallic sparkle with fully parameterized brightness/contrast/bar controls
   - **Rainbow Rare** (`rainbow-rare.frag`): Metallic sparkle spotlight + iridescent glitter from iri-7 texture, for etched SV_ULTRA double rares
   - **Tera Rainbow Rare** (`tera-rainbow-rare.frag`): Rainbow holo overlay + metallic sparkle spotlight + dual etch sparkle layers, for Tera-tagged special illustration rares
   - **Flatsilver Reverse** (`flatsilver-reverse.frag`): Inverted-mask flat silver rainbow sheen over card border/text areas (outside artwork window) with pointer-responsive spotlight, for FLAT_SILVER+REVERSE common/uncommon reverse holos
   - **Master Ball** (`master-ball.frag`): Etch foil composite on card base for RAINBOW+ETCHED masterball holo cards
   - Shared GLSL functions live in `src/shaders/common/` and are included via `#include` (resolved by `vite-plugin-glsl`):
     - `common/blend.glsl` — blend modes (overlay, screen, color-dodge, hard-light, etc.)
     - `common/filters.glsl` — adjustBrightness, adjustContrast, adjustSaturate
     - `common/rainbow.glsl` — getSunColor, sunpillarGradient (6-hue rainbow palette)
     - `common/base-adjust.glsl` — unified brightness/contrast/saturation adjustment helper
     - `common/holo-shine.glsl` — classic TCG holo shine with mask-driven rainbow overlay at configurable angles
   - All holo types use the same base uniforms and are masked by grayscale textures (`uMaskTex`, `uFoilTex`)
   - Special illustration rare, ultra rare, and rainbow rare use iridescent textures loaded from `public/img/151/iri-{7,8,9}.webp`
   - Special illustration rare additionally loads sparkle iri textures from `public/img/151/iri-{1,2}.webp` for the tilt sparkle effect (loaded via `useCardLoader.loadSparkleIriTextures()`)

### Post-processing & tone mapping

The scene always renders through an `EffectComposer` chain: `RenderPass` → `UnrealBloomPass` → `BokehPass` → `OutputPass`. The compositor runs even when DOF and bloom are disabled (passes act as passthroughs), ensuring consistent tone mapping behavior.

**Tone mapping** is applied by `OutputPass` using `renderer.toneMapping` / `renderer.toneMappingExposure`. Three.js r182+ skips per-material tone mapping when rendering to FBO (`currentRenderTarget !== null`), so `OutputPass` is the only way to get tone mapping in the compositor pipeline. The `TONE_MAP` lookup in `useThreeScene.ts` maps `ToneMappingAlgorithm` (`'aces'` | `'agx'` | `'neutral'` | `'none'`) to Three.js constants. Exposure is driven by `renderer.toneMappingExposure = Math.pow(2, config.toneMapping.exposure)` every frame.

**Color space**: `renderer.outputColorSpace = LinearSRGBColorSpace` disables the sRGB transfer in `OutputPass`. Card shaders already output gamma-space sRGB in `gl_FragColor`, so an extra linear→sRGB conversion would double-gamma them (milky washed-out look).

The **GraphicsPanel** (`src/components/GraphicsPanel.vue`) exposes three sections:
1. **Tone Mapping** — algorithm selector (ACES Filmic / AgX / Neutral / None) + exposure slider
2. **Depth of Field** — enable toggle, aperture (f-stop), max blur, focus offset
3. **Bloom** — enable toggle, strength, radius, threshold

### Shader selection logic

Cards are assigned a `holoType` automatically by `mapHoloType()` in `cardCatalog.ts` based on the JSON metadata's `rarity.designation` and `foil.type`/`foil.mask` fields:

| Rarity | Foil Type | Shader |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| any | `RAINBOW` + `ETCHED` mask | `master-ball` |
| any | `FLAT_SILVER` + `REVERSE` mask | `flatsilver-reverse` |
| `SHINY_RARE` | any | `shiny-rare` |
| `SHINY_ULTRA_RARE` | any | `ultra-rare` |
| `SPECIAL_ILLUSTRATION_RARE` | `TERA` + `SHINY` tags | `tera-shiny-rare` |
| `SPECIAL_ILLUSTRATION_RARE` | `TERA` tag | `tera-rainbow-rare` |
| `SPECIAL_ILLUSTRATION_RARE` / `HYPER_RARE` / `MEGA_HYPER_RARE` | any | `special-illustration-rare` |
| `MEGA_ATTACK_RARE` | any | `tera-rainbow-rare` |
| `ULTRA_RARE` / `ACE_SPEC_RARE` | any | `ultra-rare` |
| `DOUBLE_RARE` | `TERA` or `MEGA_EVOLUTION` tag | `tera-rainbow-rare` |
| `DOUBLE_RARE` | `SUN_PILLAR` | `double-rare` |
| `DOUBLE_RARE` | `SV_ULTRA` + `ETCHED` mask | `rainbow-rare` |
| `DOUBLE_RARE` / `ILLUSTRATION_RARE` | other | `illustration-rare` |
| `RARE` | `SV_HOLO` | `regular-holo` |
| `COMMON` / `UNCOMMON` / `RARE` (other) | `FLAT_SILVER` + `REVERSE` mask | `flatsilver-reverse` |
| `COMMON` / `UNCOMMON` / `RARE` (other) | other | `reverse-holo` |

### Card catalog & texture system

The card catalog is **JSON-driven and supports multiple sets**. Card sets are defined in `SET_REGISTRY` (`src/data/cardCatalog.ts`) and their metadata is fetched at runtime from JSON files under `public/<setId>/`.

- `CARD_CATALOG` is a `shallowRef<CardCatalogEntry[]>` that updates reactively when switching sets
- `loadSetCatalog(setId)` fetches the set's JSON, filters to foil-only entries, picks the best foil variant per card number (priority: RAINBOW > non-FLAT_SILVER > FLAT_SILVER), and builds texture paths
- File variant prefixes (e.g., `ph`, `std`, `mph`, `ph2`) are extracted from the JSON `longFormID` field by a set-code-agnostic regex in `extractPrefix()`

Each `CardCatalogEntry` defines texture paths and shader type (relative to `public/`):

- `front` — base card image (`<setId>/fronts/{NNN}_front_2x.webp`)
- `mask` — grayscale holo area mask (`<setId>/holo-masks/<setId>_{NNN}_{prefix}.foil_up.webp`)
- `foil` — grayscale etched foil texture (empty string = no etch; `<setId>/etch-foils/<setId>_{NNN}_{prefix}.etch_up.webp`)
- `holoType` — which holo shader to use (see shader selection logic above)

`useCardLoader` loads all non-empty textures in parallel with error callbacks for graceful fallback on missing files. `buildCardMesh` uses `ShaderMaterial` when any effect texture is present (selecting the appropriate fragment shader based on `holoType`), otherwise falls back to `MeshBasicMaterial`. The texture cache is cleared when switching sets to free GPU memory.

See `docs/CARD-SETS.md` for detailed documentation on the set system, JSON format, and how to add new sets.

### Asset serving (local SSD)

In production, card assets are served from a local SSD mounted into the Docker container. Nginx serves them at `/card-assets/` from `/data/assets/` (mapped to `/mnt/HC_Volume_102273859/pokebox-assets/` on the host). The `VITE_ASSET_BASE_URL` env var is set to `/card-assets/` at build time, so all asset paths via `assetUrl()` in `src/utils/assetUrl.ts` resolve to same-origin requests — no CORS needed.

**Syncing assets to the server:**

```bash
# Download from S3 (one-time migration, requires rclone with hetzner remote)
./scripts/download-s3-assets.sh ./pokebox-assets

# Sync to VPS
./scripts/sync-assets.sh user@server ./pokebox-assets
```

The Docker volume mount (`/mnt/HC_Volume_102273859/pokebox-assets:/data/assets:ro`) is read-only and compatible with the container's `read_only: true` filesystem setting.

### Asset processing scripts

- **`process-set.sh`** — Main unified pipeline: downloads card images, upscales with Real-ESRGAN, and produces the `public/<setId>/` directory structure (fronts, holo-masks, etch-foils) expected by `cardCatalog.ts`

### Booster pack opening animation

Clicking a booster pack in the modal triggers a cinematic "tear open" sequence coordinated across CSS and Three.js:

1. **CSS phases** (`BoosterPackModal.vue`): focus (0.5s slide-to-center + golden glow) → shake (0.3s wobble) → burst (0.4s scale-up + radial flash)
2. **Set loading** runs in parallel with CSS animation via `store.openPack(setId)`
3. **Cascade** (`useThreeScene`): once CSS finishes and set is loaded, `packOpeningPhase` transitions to `'cascade'`, closing the modal and triggering a fan rebuild with `introOrigin` at screen center — cards burst from a single point
4. **State machine** (`store.packOpeningPhase`): `idle` → `css-anim` → `cascade` → `idle` (or `css-anim` → `waiting-load` → `cascade` on slow networks)

The config/displayCardIds watchers in `useThreeScene` skip rebuilds during `css-anim`/`waiting-load` phases to prevent the fan intro from firing twice.

**Fan ↔ single interaction**: Click a fan card to zoom into single mode. The toolbar dropdown `switchSet()` bypasses the animation entirely.

**Mobile stack mode**: On mobile, pack opening enters `stack` mode instead of `fan` — 5 cards pile with visible edges, swipeable up/down to cycle. The top card flies off and reappears at the bottom. Arrow nav and slideshow buttons are hidden in stack mode. A "Browse Set" button appears in the bottom nav bar (next to "Packs") allowing the user to exit stack into single mode for browsing individual cards. The calibration panel, shader controls panel, graphics panel, and their toolbar toggle buttons (Settings, Graphics, Shader) are hidden on mobile via `v-if="!store.isMobile"`.

### Hero carousel

On desktop startup (when no URL params override), the app enters a hero showcase carousel — a cover-flow layout with 5 visible cards from curated `HERO_SHOWCASE` entries spanning multiple sets. The center card is full-size and face-on, side cards are progressively smaller, Y-rotated, and Z-recessed. All hero cards are built once (not rebuilt on each advance); `updateCarouselTargets()` updates lerp targets and the animation loop smoothly slides cards to new positions. Auto-rotates every 4s; N/B keys rotate manually and reset the timer. Any user interaction (set change, card select, toolbar click) exits carousel via `stopHeroShowcase()`. The set and card selector dropdowns are hidden in carousel mode since the carousel spans multiple sets.

### Toolbar layout

The toolbar (`ToolbarButtons.vue`) uses three independently-positioned zones on desktop (CSS `display: contents` on the parent, each zone is `position: fixed`):

- **zone-left** (top-left): card selector, "Packs" button, display mode dropdown
- **zone-right** (top-right): render mode, dim lights, fullscreen ⛶, settings ⚙, graphics ✨, shader ✦ (icon buttons)
- **zone-bottom** (bottom-center): slideshow, float/anchor, share (visible in single card mode)

On mobile, all zones collapse into a single flex-wrap container with `order`-based reflow.

### State-driven rebuilds

The scene watches store properties and rebuilds accordingly:

- **Full rebuild** (clears scene): screen dimensions, box depth, scene mode, render mode changes
- **Transform update** (no rebuild): card position/rotation changes
- **Uniform update** (no rebuild): holo intensity, eye position, time

### Deployment

The app is containerized with Docker (`Dockerfile` + `docker-compose.yml`):
- Multi-stage build: Node 22 builder → Nginx Alpine serving the Vite production bundle
- Nginx exposes `/health` (healthcheck) and `/nginx_status` (metrics scraping, Docker-internal only)
- The app container joins an external `monitoring` Docker network
- Watchtower label enabled for automatic image updates
- Monitoring stack (Prometheus + Grafana) lives in a separate repo (`pokebox-observability`)

## Conventions

- Path alias `@/` → `src/`
- Shader uniforms prefixed `u` (e.g. `uCardTex`), varyings prefixed `v` (e.g. `vUv`)
- Use `shallowRef` for Three.js objects to avoid deep reactivity overhead
- `worldScale` is `1.0` — scene units equal centimeters
- Card assets live under `public/<setId>/{fronts,holo-masks,etch-foils}/` (one directory per set)
- Seeded PRNG (`mulberry32`) for reproducible procedural layouts
- MediaPipe is dynamically imported to avoid bundling the full library
- Mobile detection (`store.isMobile`) is evaluated once in the Pinia store; on mobile, `cardDisplayMode` defaults to `'single'` and the display mode dropdown is hidden
- Card display modes: `single` (one card), `fan` (7-card hand), `stack` (5-card swipeable pile for mobile), `carousel` (cover-flow hero showcase across multiple sets)
- Hero carousel uses compound IDs (`setId:cardId`) and `loadHeroCatalog()` to resolve cards across different sets; compound-keyed textures are protected from `clearCache()` on set switch

## Testing

### Shader Testing

**IMPORTANT**: Always run shader tests after modifying GLSL shaders to catch compilation errors before runtime.

```bash
bun test:shader  # Run all shader tests (~1 second)
```

The shader test suite (`src/shaders/__tests__/`) includes:

1. **Static Validation** (`shader-validation.test.ts`)
   - Detects undefined function calls (e.g., missing blend mode functions)
   - Validates all uniforms and varyings are declared
   - Checks for balanced braces and parentheses
   - Verifies `gl_FragColor` is set and precision is declared
   - Runs instantly without WebGL context

2. **Compilation Tests** (`shader-compilation.test.ts`)
   - Creates ShaderMaterial for each shader variant
   - Verifies Three.js can parse shaders without errors
   - Validates uniform configuration

**When adding new shaders**:

1. Use shared includes (`#include "common/blend.glsl"`, etc.) instead of copy-pasting blend modes/filters
2. Add shader to both test files
3. List required uniforms in compilation test
4. Run `bun test:shader` to verify
5. Add uniform↔config mappings to `SHADER_UNIFORM_REGISTRY` in `src/data/shaderRegistry.ts`, defaults to `src/data/defaults.ts`, types to `AppConfig` in `src/types/`, and the fragment shader import to `buildCard.ts`
6. Add a UI section to `ShaderControlsPanel.vue` with slider definitions for all configurable uniforms — without this, the panel shows "No controls available" when viewing cards with the new shader

**When modifying shader uniforms**:

or adding new visual controls, ALWAYS update all related files in a single pass: the shader (.glsl/.frag), `shaderRegistry.ts` (uniform↔config mapping), `defaults.ts` (default values), the Vue component (`ShaderControlsPanel.vue`), and the `AppConfig` type. The registry is the single source of truth — `buildCard.ts` reads initial values from it and `useUniformWatchers.ts` creates reactive watchers from it automatically. Do not consider the task complete until all files are updated.

**When modifying shared includes** (`src/shaders/common/*.glsl`):

- Changes affect ALL shaders that include them — run `bun test:shader` and visually verify
- Never remove a function from a shared include without checking all consuming shaders

**Common errors caught by tests**:

- Undefined blend mode functions (e.g., `blendScreen` not defined)
- Missing uniform declarations
- Type mismatches in GLSL operations
- Syntax errors (missing semicolons, unbalanced braces)

See `docs/SHADER-TESTING.md` for detailed testing documentation.

### Asset Integrity Testing

```bash
bun test:assets  # Optional — requires card assets in public/
```

The asset integrity test (`src/data/__tests__/asset-integrity.test.ts`) verifies that every texture path generated by the card catalog logic has a matching file on disk. For each set in `SET_REGISTRY`, it reads the set JSON, runs the same `pickBestFoilEntry` + `extractPrefix` logic as the runtime, and checks that front, holo-mask, and etch-foil files exist under `public/`. This test is **excluded from `bun test:unit`** because contributors typically don't have the full card asset sets locally. Run it after processing a new set or renaming asset files.
