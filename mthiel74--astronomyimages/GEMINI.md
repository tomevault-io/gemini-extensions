# AstronomyImages

Interactive astronomy image viewer and analysis toolkit for accessing real telescope data and virtual observatory archives.

## Project Overview

This project provides Python-based tools for downloading, visualizing, and analyzing astronomical images from public sky surveys and virtual observatories. It includes both command-line scripts and interactive GUI applications for exploring the night sky.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Sky Map Viewer**: Click-based interface to explore any region of the sky with real telescope data
- **Multiple Survey Support**: Access to DSS2 (Red/Blue/IR), 2MASS (J/H/K bands), WISE, and other sky surveys
- **Real-Time Downloads**: Fetch FITS astronomical images via NASA SkyView API
- **Advanced Visualization**: Multiple color maps, intensity scaling, and analysis tools
- **FITS File Support**: Full support for astronomical FITS format with WCS (World Coordinate System)
- **Simulation Capabilities**: Generate simulated observations for educational purposes (Horsehead Nebula demo)

## Main Scripts

### Interactive Applications
- **`interactive_sky_map.py`**: Full-featured GUI with clickable all-sky map, constellation overlays, and telescope view
- **`astronomy_viewer_gui.py`**: Simplified viewer with object catalog and manual coordinate entry

### Demonstration & Examples
- **`horsehead_complete_demo.py`**: Complete workflow demonstration with simulated Horsehead Nebula observation
  - Physics-based simulation of dark nebulae
  - Optical depth calculations
  - Comprehensive 9-panel analysis plots
  - API documentation and examples

### Utility Scripts

# Download and view in real-time
```

### Simple Viewer
```bash
python astronomy_viewer_gui.py
# Choose from catalog of famous objects
# Or enter manual coordinates
# Download FITS and save locally
```

### Run Horsehead Demo
```bash
python horsehead_complete_demo.py
# Generates simulated observation
# Creates comprehensive analysis plots
# Outputs FITS, PNG, and JSON files
```

## Technical Notes

- All coordinates use J2000 equatorial system (RA/Dec in degrees)
- FITS images include WCS headers for coordinate mapping
- Default pixel scale: 1 arcsec/pixel (configurable)
- Image scaling: Linear or percentile-based (1-99%)
- No API keys required for SkyView access

## Educational Applications

- Learn about astronomical coordinate systems
- Explore real telescope data interactively
- Understand FITS file format and WCS
- Practice image analysis techniques
- Visualize dark nebulae and emission regions

## Security & Privacy

- **No authentication credentials stored in code**
- All API tokens are placeholder examples only ("YOUR_API_TOKEN")
- Safe for public repository sharing
- Network requests use standard HTTPS

## Future Enhancements

- Add support for more sky surveys (Pan-STARRS, etc.)
- Implement advanced image processing (stacking, calibration)
- Integration with SIMBAD/NED for object identification
- Export to DS9 region files
- Multi-wavelength comparison views
