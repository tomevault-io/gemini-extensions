# AGENTS.md

OpenScreen is a free, open-source screen recorder and video editor (Electron + React + TypeScript + Pixi.js) maintained as a continuation of the original v1.5.0 release. This file is the canonical guide for any AI coding agent working in this repo.

## Setup commands

- Install deps: `npm install` (Node 22.22.1, npm 10.9.4 — see `package.json#engines`)
- Start dev:    `npm run dev` (Vite dev server; Electron window opens via `vite-plugin-electron`)
- Build:        `npm run build` (TypeScript check + Vite build + electron-builder)
- Typecheck:    `npx tsc --noEmit` — app code only. CI also runs `npx tsc -p tsconfig.test.json --noEmit` in a separate job ("Typecheck (tests)"), so **run both**: test files are invisible to the root config, and a type error in a `*.test.ts` fails CI while the root check stays green.
- Test (unit):  `npx vitest --run <path>` while you work, `npm run test` once at the end — see [Testing instructions](#testing-instructions)
- Test (e2e):   `npm run test:e2e` (Playwright)
- Lint:         `npm run lint` (Biome 2.4)
- Format:       `npm run format` (Biome, tabs, double quotes, 100-col)
- i18n check:   `npm run i18n:check` (validates the 13 locale files)

## Project layout

- `src/` — React app: UI, editor components, timeline, i18n, captioning/cursor/exporter libs
- `electron/` — main process, IPC, recording orchestration
- `electron/native/` — **native** capture helpers: `screencapturekit/` (Swift, macOS) and `wgc-capture/` (C++/Win32, Windows). These are built and shipped with the app, not loaded from npm
- `technical-documentation/` — architecture, engineering and testing reference (start at its README)
- `tests/` — Playwright e2e specs + fixtures
- `scripts/` — native build scripts, diagnostic tools
- `nix/`, `flake.nix` — Linux packaging
- `release/`, `dist-electron/` — build artifacts (gitignored)

## Code style

- TypeScript strict mode (`tsconfig.json`). No `any` (Biome `noExplicitAny` is `warn` — don't add new `any`).
- Biome handles lint AND format. Tabs, double quotes, 100-col width, LF line endings. Run `npm run lint:fix` before committing.
- React functional components only. Hooks at top level (Biome `useHookAtTopLevel` is `error`).
- Imports: use the `useImportType` discipline (Biome organizes them).
- Husky + lint-staged runs Biome on staged `*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx,mts,cts,json}`.
- The repo is pre-1.x and not production-grade — rough edges are expected, but new code should be clean.

## Testing instructions

### When to run what

The full unit suite is ~1670 tests over 140 files and takes over a minute. Running it after
every edit is the main way an agent turns a 5-minute task into a 30-minute one, so don't:

- **While you work** — run only what you touched: `npx vitest --run src/lib/foo.test.ts`,
  or `npx vitest --run src/lib/ai-edition` for a directory. `npm run test:changed` picks
  the affected files off the working tree, `npx vitest --run --changed main` off the
  branch diff. A single file is 1–10s against ~80s for everything.
- **Typecheck and lint freely** — `npx tsc --noEmit` and `npm run lint` are seconds, not
  minutes. They are the right inner-loop check, not the test suite.
- **Once, at the end** — `npm run test` before you commit or open the PR. One full run per
  task, not per edit. If the change is narrow and CI will run anyway, the targeted run plus
  CI is enough; say so rather than burning the wall-clock twice.
- **Never** `npm run test:watch` — it does not terminate, and it will hang the session.

### Layout and conventions

- Unit tests live next to source as `*.test.ts` / `*.test.tsx` (Vitest). Config is
  `vitest.config.ts`; it covers `src/`, `electron/` and `.github/`.
- **The default environment is `node`.** A test that needs a DOM opts in with
  `// @vitest-environment jsdom` on line 1 — that is also the fix for `document is not
  defined`. Don't add it to a test that doesn't need it: jsdom setup dominates this
  suite's runtime (see the comment in `vitest.config.ts`).
- Anything platform-conditional (`process.platform`) must pin the platform in the test.
  CI is Linux-only, so a Linux-only code path left unpinned is green in CI and red on
  every Windows and macOS machine — `electron/recording/webm-seek-index.test.ts` is the
  worked example.
- E2E tests are in `tests/e2e/` (Playwright). Some specs are platform-specific (e.g. `windows-native-checklist.spec.ts`).
- Add a test for every new behavior in the same package as the code under test.
- All tests must pass before opening a PR. CI runs `npm run test` on every PR.

## Desktop E2E testing with computer-use

Unit/browser tests can't exercise real capture (native screen recording, a physical webcam, the tray). To verify a recording/editor feature end to end, drive the actual Electron app with the **computer-use** MCP (screenshot + click/type on the desktop). This is the required "manual smoke test on real Windows/macOS" for native changes.

**Launch the app**

- Normal: `npm run dev` — Vite serves the renderer and `vite-plugin-electron` opens the Electron window. The main process logs `Global shortcut registered: CommandOrControl+Shift+O` when ready (Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+O toggles the HUD).
- The app is single-instance through `app.requestSingleInstanceLock()`, which keys on the `userData` path. If a leftover Electron process still holds it, a new launch quits silently (exit 0, no window) — kill leftover `electron` processes before relaunching. The lock is held by the OS and dies with the process, so there is nothing to clean up on disk. A dev build and the installed `Openscreen` resolve different `userData` paths and can run side by side.
- **From a git worktree** (no `node_modules`/native binaries): junction/symlink `node_modules` from the main checkout (deps are usually identical — check `package-lock.json`), and copy the prebuilt native capture binaries from `electron/native/bin/<platform>/` (gitignored — rebuilding needs the full VS/Xcode toolchain). Then `npm run dev` works normally.

**Granting access**

- `request_access` resolves names against installed apps. A **dev build runs as `electron.exe`** (or `Electron.app`), *not* the installed `Openscreen` — grant **`electron.exe`** or the dev window stays masked in screenshots. Non-allowlisted windows are masked (solid rectangles); the screenshot note lists their process names to add.

**The HUD widget** (recording controller)

- **It is invisible in screenshots by default.** The HUD (and the Notes window) call `setContentProtection(true)` so the recording controls never end up baked into a recording — the same `SetWindowDisplayAffinity` that WGC honours also hides them from *your* screenshots. The window is there, and clicks land, but you are aiming blind at a rectangle you cannot see. Set **`OPENSCREEN_DISABLE_CONTENT_PROTECTION=1`** in the app's environment to turn it off for a session; every skipped window logs a warning. Unset it before recording anything real, or the HUD ends up in the video.
- **On macOS 26+ content protection is auto-disabled, so the HUD *is* visible and screenshottable with no flag.** That OS never displays a content-protected window at all — not just absent from captures, but never painted, leaving a tray icon, a live renderer and nothing on screen (confirmed on macOS 26.5 / Electron 41.2.1). `applyContentProtection` therefore skips the call there and logs a warning per window; the trade-off is that the HUD can appear in recordings on that OS until the ScreenCaptureKit helper excludes our own windows via `SCContentFilter(excludingWindows:)`, which it currently passes as `[]`. `OPENSCREEN_FORCE_CONTENT_PROTECTION=1` re-enables it to re-test against a future Electron.
- The HUD is what opens the editor (clapper icon, tooltip *Open Studio*), so without that flag a whole slice of the app is unreachable from automation: killing the app to redeploy a native addon leaves you unable to reopen a project.
- Frameless, transparent, always-on-top, `skipTaskbar`, centered at the **bottom of the primary display** (`createHudOverlayWindow`, 600×160). It is **click-through** (`setIgnoreMouseEvents(true, { forward: true })`): moving the real cursor over an interactive control makes that region clickable and shows its tooltip, so `mouse_move` → screenshot → `left_click` works; a blind click on empty HUD area passes through to the desktop.
- Control row (left→right): layout preset, **source** button (`Screen`/`Window` → label becomes the picked source), system-audio toggle, mic toggle, **webcam toggle** (shows the detected camera name), cursor-highlight toggle, **record**, notes, open-editor, language, minimize, close. The record button is disabled until a source is chosen (tooltip: "Please select a source to record").

**The tray icon** (bottom-right notification area)

- Because the HUD skips the taskbar and can be minimized/hidden, the **system-tray icon is the reliable way to refocus the app**: **left-click or double-click reopens/focuses the HUD** (`showMainWindow`). Its icon swaps to a red dot while recording.
- **Right-click → context menu**: *Open* / *Quit* when idle, or ***Stop Recording*** while recording (mirrors the HUD's stop). Tooltip shows `OpenScreen` or `Recording: <source>`. Use this to stop a recording if the HUD isn't reachable.

**End-to-end flow (record → edit)**

1. On the HUD: click the **webcam** toggle to enable the camera, then the **source** button → pick the *Screens*/*Windows* tab → select a thumbnail → **Share**.
2. Click **record**; the HUD switches to a red stop button with a running timer (a countdown overlay may show first).
3. Stop via the HUD's red button (or tray → *Stop Recording*). The **editor window opens** with the screen recording and the webcam PiP.
4. Exercise the feature in the editor (e.g. Full Camera: press **C** to add a segment on the timeline, scrub to see the webcam grow to fullscreen and ease back; **Ctrl+Z** / **Ctrl+Shift+Z** undo/redo).
5. Capture a screenshot as proof. Clean up: stop `npm run dev`, remove temporary worktree junctions/lock.

**Judging the rendered picture**

- A preview screenshot is a **downscaled** view of the compositor's output (a 1920-wide render shown in a ~600px pane, then downscaled again by the screenshot). Fine detail — a corner radius, a 1° edge slope, a soft shadow — does not survive that, and squinting at it produces confident wrong conclusions. To decide anything about pixels, **export and measure**: `Export → MP4 1080p`, then `ffmpeg -ss <t> -i out.mp4 -frames:v 1 -c:v ppm frame.ppm` and walk the raw bytes (a P6 PPM is a 15-line parser) for the exact edges. That is what settled a "the tilt is truncated" report: measured right edge 1539 px against a computed corner at 1540 — no clipping at all, the real defect was elsewhere.
- ffmpeg lives at `crates/thirdparty/ffmpeg-*/bin/ffmpeg.exe` (also needed on `PATH` for the compositor addon to load).

## PR & commit conventions

- Branch from `main`; never push to it directly.
- Commit messages: short imperative summary, optional body. Recent style mixes conventional-ish prefixes (`ci:`, `chore:`, `fix:`) with plain messages — either is fine, just be consistent within a PR.
- **PR titles must follow Conventional Commits** (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`, `perf:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `build:`, `ci:`, `style:`, `revert:`). Enforced by the `semantic-pr` job in `ci.yml`. This feeds GitHub's auto-generated release notes with clean categories.
- Open PR via `gh pr create` once CI is green.
- PR template is in `.github/pull_request_template.md`.

## Release flow

Two `workflow_dispatch` workflows cut a release with a pre-release candidate (RC) first, then promote to stable. Trunk-based, no extra branch. Full operational guide in `.harness/docs/git-workflow.md` § Release flow.

- **Cut RC**: Actions → "Cut a release candidate" → Run workflow. Inputs: `bump` (patch|minor|major), `rc_number` (default 1), optional `target_version` override. Snaps issues out of the rolling `Next Release` milestone into a versioned `vX.Y.Z` milestone, bumps `package.json`, pushes the `vX.Y.Z-rc.N` tag, which triggers the existing `build.yml` to publish a GitHub pre-release. RCs are notarized like stable releases, which also rehearses the credentials before the promotion build depends on them. Notifies `#rc-testing` on Discord.
- **Promote RC**: Actions → "Promote RC to stable release" → Run workflow. Input: `rc_tag` (e.g. `v1.5.0-rc.2`), optional `release_notes_extra`. Closes the `vX.Y.Z` milestone, strips `-rc.N` from `package.json`, pushes `vX.Y.Z` tag, which triggers `build.yml` to publish a stable release (full notarization, Tier 3 homebrew/winget/nix/aur fires). Notifies `#announcements` on Discord.
- **Manual fallback**: `git tag vX.Y.Z-rc.N <sha> && git push origin vX.Y.Z-rc.N` does the same as Cut RC (minus the milestone migration and Discord announce) — useful for emergency cuts.

Both workflows require the `OPENSCREEN_RELEASE_TOKEN` secret (a fine-grained PAT with `contents: write` + `issues: write`). This is the standard fix for `release: published` not triggering downstream workflows when the release is created by `GITHUB_TOKEN`. See `technical-documentation/engineering/release-and-secrets.md`.

**Release branches freeze the build between cut and promote.** Every RC cut creates `release/vX.Y.Z-rc.N`. The branch is *not* merged into `main` until the stable tag is published; only cherry-picks of bugfixes land on the release branch during the RC window. The stable tag points at the branch tip (RC + cherry-picks), then `promote.yml` opens a `release/vX.Y.Z-sync → main` PR to bring main into line. This contract exists because of the v1.6.0 incident (2026-07-05) where the original promote workflow tagged `main` instead of the RC snapshot, causing 23 unreleased commits to ship in `v1.6.0`. Full rules in `.harness/docs/git-workflow.md` § Release branches.

## Security

- Never commit secrets. `.env.example` exists; real `.env` is gitignored.
- `macos.entitlements` controls macOS permissions — review when touching native recorder.
- Native helpers run with elevated privileges on user systems; treat code in `electron/*-helper/` as security-sensitive.

## Specialized notes

- **Native capture is platform-fragile**: macOS uses ScreenCaptureKit (Swift), Windows uses WGC (C++/Win32). CI runs on Linux only — manual smoke test on real macOS/Windows is required for native changes.
- **Pixi.js v8** is the rendering engine. Filters come from `pixi-filters` and `@pixi/filter-drop-shadow`. GSAP + `motion` for animation.
- **i18n**: 13 locales in `src/i18n/locales/<locale>/` (e.g. `src/i18n/locales/en/settings.json`). The `i18n:check` script validates them — run it after touching translation files.
- **Build pipeline**: `npm run build` is full electron-builder. For iterating on renderer only, use `npm run build-vite` (Vite + tsc, no packaging).
- **README tone**: the project is explicitly "not production-grade" and free forever — don't add paywalls, premium tiers, or upsell language to UI/copy.
