# Pipelex Coding Rules

## Codex Cloud Commands

### Linting

   After making code changes, you must always lint using `make agent-check`.

   ```bash
   make agent-check
   # If the current system doesn't have the `make` command,
   # lookup the "agent-check" target in the Makefile and run the commands one by one (targets fix-unused-imports format lint pyright mypy)
   ```

   This runs multiple code quality tools:
   - Pyright: Static type checking
   - Ruff: Fix unused imports, lint, format  
   - Mypy: Static type checker
   - plxt: Format and lint TOML, MTHDS, and PLX files

   Always fix any issues reported by these tools before proceeding.

### Cleaning Derived Files

   If you need to clean derived files and caches, typically after you erased files or moved tests, the linters can get confused, the pytest collection can be off...

   ```bash
   make cleanderived
   ```

### Running Tests in Codex Cloud

    To test everything that can be tested from within the Codex Cloud sandbox, run this:

    ```bash
    make codex-tests
    # It's equivalent to running pytest with `-m "(dry_runnable or not inference) and not (pipelex_api or codex_disabled)"`
    # If some test fails, re-run it with `-s -vv` to see more details
    ```

### Prerequisites for running command lines: use virtual environment

   **CRITICAL**: Before running any `pipelex` commands or `pytest`, you MUST use the appropriate Python virtual environment. The only exceptions are our `make` commands which already include the env activation.

   Call the CLI directly from the virtual environment:

   ```bash
   .venv/bin/pytest -s -v -k test_render_jinja2_from_text
   .venv/bin/pipelex validate --all
   ```

   For standard installations, the virtual environment is named `.venv`. Always check this first. On Windows, the path is `.venv\Scripts\` instead of `.venv/bin/`.

### Pipelex Dev CLI (`pipelex-dev`)

   The `pipelex-dev` CLI provides internal development tools that are not distributed with the package. It is available in the virtual environment.

   ```bash
   .venv/bin/pipelex-dev --help
   ```

   Key commands:

   - **`generate-mthds-schema`**: Regenerate the MTHDS JSON Schema (`derived/mthds_schema.json`). Run this after modifying `mthds_schema_generator.py`.

     ```bash
     .venv/bin/pipelex-dev generate-mthds-schema
     ```

### Pipelex CLI Commands

   To run the Pipelex CLI commands without the logo, you can use the `--no-logo` flag, this will avoid useless tokens in the console output.

   ```bash
   .venv/bin/pipelex --help
   .venv/bin/pipelex build --help --no-logo
   .venv/bin/pipelex run --help --no-logo
   .venv/bin/pipelex validate --help --no-logo
   .venv/bin/pipelex doctor --help --no-logo
   .venv/bin/pipelex init --help --no-logo
   ```

## Coding Standards & Best Practices for Python Code

This document outlines the core coding standards, best practices, and quality control procedures for the codebase.

### Python Version Compatibility

    - The project supports Python 3.10+ (`requires-python = ">=3.10,<3.15"`). Never use features introduced after Python 3.10 without a compatibility fallback.
    - Common pitfalls:
      - `datetime.UTC` was added in Python 3.11. Use `datetime.timezone.utc` instead.
      - `StrEnum` was added in Python 3.11. Always import it from `pipelex.types` which handles retrocompatibility.
      - `type` statement (PEP 695) was added in Python 3.12. Use `TypeAlias` from `typing` instead.
      - `ExceptionGroup` / `except*` was added in Python 3.11. Avoid unless using the `exceptiongroup` backport.

### Variables, loops and indexes

    - Variable names should have a minimum length of 3 characters. No exceptions: name your `for` loop indexes like `index_foobar`, your exceptions `exc` or more specific like `validation_error` when there are several layers of exceptions, and use `for key, value in ...` for key/value pairs.
    - When looping on the keys of a dict, use `for key in the_dict` rather than `for key in the_dict.keys()` otherwise you won't pass linting.
    - Avoid inline for loops, unless it's ultra-simple and holds on oneline.
    - If you have a variable that will get its value differently through different code paths, declare it first with a type, e.g. `pipe_code: str` but DO NOT give it a default value like `pipe_code: str = ""` unless it's really justified. We want the variable to be unbound until all paths are covered, and the linters will help us avoid bugs this way.

### Enums and tests

    - When defining enums related to string values, always inherit from `StrEnum`
    - When you need the enum value as a string, don't use `str(enum_var)` or `enum_var.value`, just use `enum_var` itself, that is the point of using StrEnum!
    - Never test equality to an enum value: use match/case, even to single out 1 case out of 10 cases. To avoid heavy match/case code in awkward places, add @property methods to the enum class such as `is_foobar()`. This is to avoid bugs: when new enum values are added we want the linter to complain. Use the `|` operator to group cases
    - As our match/case constructs over enums are always exhaustive, NEVER add a default `case _: ...`. Otherwise, you won't pass linting.
    - `StrEnum` must be imported from `pipelex.types` (handles python retrocompatibility):
    ```python
    from pipelex.types import StrEnum
    ```

### Optionals

- Don't write things like `a = b if b else c`, write `a = b or c` instead.

### Imports

#### **Imports at the top of the file**

    - Avoid as much as possible import statements outside of a module's top-level scope.
    - Do not import libraries in functions or classes unless in very specific cases, to be discussed with the user, as they would required a `# noqa: ...` comment to pass linting
    - Do not bother with ordering the imports or removing unused imports, our Ruff linter will handle it for us.
    - `if TYPE_CHECKING:` blocks must always be the **last** block in the imports section, placed after all regular imports.

#### **Removing unused imports**

    - To remove unused imports, run `make fix-unused-imports` or `make fui` (shorthand). This is faster and cheaper than rewriting with LLM.

#### **No re-exports in `__init__.py`**

    - Do NOT fill `__init__.py` files with re-exports.
    - Always use direct full-path imports everywhere. For example:

- **Logging and Pretty Printing**:

    - Both `log()` and `pretty_print()` can be imported from `pipelex` directly:
    ```python
    from pipelex import log, pretty_print

    log.info("Hello, world!")
    ```
    - Both have a title arg which is handy when logging/printing objects:

    ```python
    log.verbose("Hello, world!", title="Your first Pipelex log")
    pretty_print(output_object, title="Your first Pipelex output")
    ```
    - Both handle formatting json using Rich, pretty_print makes it prettier.

- **StrEnum and Self type**:

    - Both `StrEnum` and `Self` must be imported from `pipelex.types` (handles python retrocompatibility):
    ```python
    from pipelex.types import Self, StrEnum
    ```

### Typing

#### **Always Use Type Hints**

    - Every function parameter must be typed
    - Every function return must be typed
    - Use type hints for all variables where type is not obvious
    - Use dict, list, tuple types with lowercase first letter: dict[], list[], tuple[]
    - Use type hints for all fields
    - Use Field(default_factory=...) for mutable defaults
    - Use `# pyright: ignore[specificError]` or `# type: ignore` only as a last resort. In particular, if you are sure about the type, you often solve issues by using cast() or creating a new typed variable.

#### **BaseModel / Pydantic Standards**

    - Use `BaseModel` and respect Pydantic v2 standards
    - Use the modern `ConfigDict` when needed, e.g. `model_config = ConfigDict(extra="forbid", strict=True)`
    - Keep models focused and single-purpose
    - For list fields with non-string items in BaseModels, use `empty_list_factory_of()` to avoid linter complaints:
      ```python
      from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
      from pipelex.tools.typing.pydantic_utils import empty_list_factory_of
      
      class MyModel(BaseModel):
          names: list[str] = Field(default_factory=list)  # OK for strings
          numbers: list[int] = Field(default_factory=empty_list_factory_of(int), description="A list of numbers")
          items: list[MyItem] = Field(default_factory=empty_list_factory_of(MyItem), description="A list of items")
      ```

### Factory Pattern

    - Use factory pattern for object creation when dealing with multiple implementations
    - Our factory methods are named `make_from_...` and such

### Protocols and Interfaces

    - When a getter (e.g. `get_report_delegate()`, `get_library_manager()`) returns a `Protocol` type, callers must only rely on methods declared on that `Protocol`. If you need to call a method that lives on a concrete implementation, **extend the `Protocol`** — do not work around it with `isinstance(...)` checks, `cast(...)`, or inline imports of the concrete class.
    - When extending the `Protocol`, also update every implementation (including no-op / null implementations) so structural typing is satisfied. For implementations where the method has nothing to do, give it a `pass` body — that is the whole point of having a `Protocol` rather than a concrete base class.
    - Smell to watch for: an inline `from ... import ConcreteImpl  # noqa: PLC0415` followed by `if isinstance(delegate, ConcreteImpl): delegate.some_method(...)`. This is almost always a missing method on the `Protocol`. Promote it.
    - Use `@override` (from `typing_extensions`) on every implementation of a `Protocol` method, so that signature drift between the `Protocol` and its implementations is caught by the type checker.

### Error Handling

    - Always catch exceptions at the place where you can add useful context to it.
    - Use try/except blocks with specific exceptions
    - Convert third-party exceptions to our custom ones except in pydantic validators where you can raise a ValueError or a TypeError
    - **NEVER write `except Exception:` (or bare `except:`).** Catching the generic `Exception` is FORBIDDEN everywhere except at the absolute root of a CLI command or an API endpoint handler. There are NO other exceptions to this rule. The following are NOT valid justifications and the agent must reject them when tempted:
        - "I want to log and re-raise" → just let it propagate; logging happens at the root.
        - "I want to swallow it just in case" → don't. Unknown failures must surface.
        - "I want to convert it to our error type" → only if you know which specific exception(s) the call can raise; catch those explicitly.
        - "The third-party lib isn't well typed" → look up the actual exceptions it raises and catch those by name.
        - "It's safer this way" → it isn't. It hides bugs. Crashing loudly on an unexpected exception is the desired behavior.
        If you find yourself writing `except Exception`, STOP and ask the user before proceeding.
    - **Do NOT add try/except speculatively.** Only add a `try`/`except` when (a) a specific exception type is documented or known to be raised by the call, AND (b) you have a concrete recovery path or a meaningful context to attach. Otherwise, let the error bubble up — that is the correct behavior, not a gap to fill.
    - **Use `try`/`finally` (without `except`) for required cleanup.** When a piece of code MUST run on the way out — releasing a resource, closing a tracer, tearing down a library, clearing per-context state on a manager — put it in a `finally` block (or a `with`/context manager). This is the correct way to guarantee cleanup on both the happy path and the error path: it does NOT suppress the exception, it just ensures cleanup happens before the exception propagates. Do not invent an `except Exception` just to attach cleanup; use `finally` instead. Conversely, do not move cleanup into the success path "to keep things simple" — if it must run on errors too, it belongs in `finally`.
    - When reviewing existing code, treat any `except Exception` you encounter as a bug to fix (replace it with the specific exception(s) actually raised, or remove the try/except entirely), not as a precedent to follow.
    - Always add `from exc` to the exception raise statements
    - Always write the error message as a variable before raising it, for cleaner error traces
   
   ```python
   try:
       self.models_manager.setup()
   except RoutingProfileLibraryNotFoundError as exc:
       msg = "The routing library could not be found, please call `pipelex init config` to create it"
       raise PipelexSetupError(msg) from exc
   ```

### Documentation

1. **Docstring Format**
   ```python
   def process_image(image_path: str, size: tuple[int, int]) -> bytes:
       """Process and resize an image.
       
       Args:
           image_path: Path to the source image
           size: Tuple of (width, height) for resizing
           
       Returns:
           Processed image as bytes
       """
       pass
   ```

2. **Class Documentation**
   ```python
   class ImageProcessor:
       """Handles image processing operations.
       
       Provides methods for resizing, converting, and optimizing images.
       """
   ```

## Standards related to developing the Pipelex codebase

### Spec vs Blueprint Architecture

- **Blueprints** (`pipelex/pipe_operators/`, `pipelex/pipe_controllers/`, `pipelex/core/`) are the MTHDS language reference — what `.mthds` files parse into.
- **Specs** (`pipelex/builder/pipe/`) are a convenience authoring format for AI agents. Each spec has `to_blueprint()` that transforms it into the corresponding blueprint. Spec-level fields may differ from blueprint-level fields.

When adding validation or fields, decide which layer they belong to. Language rules go on blueprints; authoring convenience goes on specs. See `pipelex/builder/CLAUDE.md` for details.

### Main config

- The main config model is defined using `ConfigModel` classes, derived from `pydantic BaseModel`
- The model is defined in `pipelex/system/configuration/configs.py`, some of the submodels being defined in their respective sub-packages
- When adding new configs, place them where it makes most sense, ask the user if you need arbitrage
- As per our python standards, use StrEnum for multiple-value enums. In that case they must not be strict pydantic fields, i.e. add `= Field(strict=False)`
- **Important**: NEVER EVER set default values for config attributes in the class definition. All the default values are defined in the main config file `pipelex/pipelex.toml`. The only exception si for Optional values which must be set to `None` in the class definition.
- If (and only if) you add some config that will clearly make sense for client projects to override, for instance if it's a case of user preference, then you can also add a copy of the settings to the project override config file `.pipelex/pipelex.toml` but leaving them commented out, as an invitation to override.
- The different `pipelex.toml` files and the python model `configs.py` must be up to date with each other in terms of structure and attributes, otherwise the loading of teh config fails. To check quickly that you're good, just run `make tb` which tests the boot sequence, which includes the config loading.

## Writing tests

### Unit test generalities

NEVER USE unittest.mock. Instead YOU MUST USE pytest-mock: `from pytest_mock import MockerFixture`.
NEVER EVER put more than one TestClass into a test module.

#### Test file structure

- Name test files with `test_` prefix
- Place test files in the appropriate test category directory:
    - `tests/unit/` - for unit tests that test individual functions/classes in isolation
    - `tests/integration/` - for integration tests that test component interactions
    - `tests/e2e/` - for end-to-end tests that test complete methods
- Do NOT add `__init__.py` files to test directories. Test directories do not need to be Python packages.
- Fixtures are defined in conftest.py modules at different levels of the hierarchy, their scope is handled by pytest
- Test data is placed inside test_data.py at different levels of the hierarchy, they must be imported with package paths from the root like `from tests.integration.pipelex.cogt.test_data`. Their content is all constants, regrouped inside classes to keep things tidy.
- Always put tests inside Test classes: 1 TestClass per module.
- NEVER EVER put more than one TestClass into a test module.
- Put fixtures into conftest.py files for easy sharing.

#### Markers

Apply the appropriate markers:
- "gha_disabled: will not be able to run properly on GitHub Actions"
- "llm: uses an LLM to generate text or objects"
- "img_gen: uses an image generation AI"
- "extract: uses text/image extraction from documents"
- "inference: uses either an LLM or an image generation AI"
- never add "@pytest.mark.dry_runnable" if you haven't set the "inference" marker

Several markers may be applied. For instance, if the test uses an LLM, then it uses inference, so you must mark with both `inference`and `llm`.

#### Important rules

- Never use the unittest.mock. Use pytest-mock.

#### Test Class Structure

- Always group the tests of a module into a test class:

```python
@pytest.mark.llm
@pytest.mark.inference
@pytest.mark.asyncio(loop_scope="class")
class TestFooBar:
    @pytest.mark.parametrize(
        "topic, test_case_blueprint",
        [
            TestCases.CASE_1,
            TestCases.CASE_2,
        ],
    )
    async def test_pipe_processing(
        self,
        request: FixtureRequest,
        topic: str,
        test_case_blueprint: StuffBlueprint,
    ):
        # Test implementation
```

- Never more than 1 class per test module.
- When testing one method, if possible, limit the number of test functions, but with different test cases in parameters

#### Test Data Organization

- If it's not already there, create a `test_data.py` file in the proper test directory
- Note how we avoid initializing a default mutable value within a class instance, instead we use ClassVar.
- Also note that we provide a topic for the test case, which is purely for convenience.

### Best Practices for Testing

- Use strong asserts: test value, not just type and presence.
- Use parametrize for multiple test cases
- Test both success and failure cases
- Verify working memory state
- Check output structure and content
- Use meaningful test case names
- Include concise docstrings explaining test purpose but not on top of the file and not on top of the class.
- Log outputs for debugging

## Writing Docs

We use Material for MkDocs. All markdown in our docs must be compatible with Material for MkDocs and done using best practices to get the best results with Material for MkDocs.

### MkDocs Markdown Requirements

- Always add a blank line before any bullet lists or numbered lists in MkDocs markdown.

## Test-Driven Development Guide

This document outlines our test-driven development (TDD) process and the tools available for testing.

### TDD Cycle

1. **Write a Test First**

2. **Write the Code**
   - Implement the minimum amount of code needed to pass the test
   - Follow the project's coding standards
   - Keep it simple - don't write more than needed

3. **Run Linting and Type Checking**

4. **Validate tests**

Remember: The key to TDD is writing the test first and letting it drive your implementation. Then, always run the full test suite and quality checks before considering a feature complete.
