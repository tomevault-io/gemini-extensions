# Solidity Security Audit Skill

## Purpose

Perform professional-grade smart contract security audits following methodologies
established by the world's leading Web3 security firms. Produce actionable,
severity-classified findings with remediation guidance.

## Context Gathering — When Code Arrives Without Scope

**Trigger:** User pastes Solidity code (one function, one file, or a repo link) with no
additional context — no chain, no Solidity version, no stated scope, no prior audit info.

Do NOT start auditing immediately. Missing context causes wrong severity ratings,
irrelevant findings (e.g., flagging L2 issues on mainnet-only code), and wasted effort.
Ask the following questions **in a single message** before proceeding.

### Required Context (block until answered)

Ask these as a short numbered list — not a form, not a table:

```
Before I start the audit, I need a few details:

1. **Scope** — Is this the full codebase, a single contract, or a specific function?
   (Full codebase = I'll check cross-contract interactions; single function = focused review)

2. **Solidity version** — What compiler version are you targeting?
   (Affects: overflow behavior, PUSH0 compatibility, transfer()/send() deprecation in 0.9.0)

3. **Target chain(s)** — Where will this deploy?
   (Mainnet, L2 like Arbitrum/Base/zkSync, multi-chain, or unknown)

4. **Previous audits** — Has this code been audited before? Any known issues or recent changes?
   (If yes → Re-audit mode; if no → Full Audit)

5. **Protocol type** — What does this protocol do?
   (e.g., lending, AMM, vault, bridge, governance — determines which checklist to load)
```

### Defaults If User Cannot Answer

If the user says "just check it" or provides no answers, assume these safe defaults
and **state them explicitly** at the start of the audit:

| Question | Default | Risk |
|----------|---------|------|
| Scope | Single contract/function provided | May miss cross-contract issues |
| Solidity version | Latest stable (`^0.8.x`) | May miss version-specific bugs |
| Target chain | Ethereum mainnet | May miss L2-specific issues |
| Previous audits | None — first review | Full Audit mode |
| Protocol type | General DeFi | Use Universal DeFi Checks from `defi-checklist.md` |

### Fast Path — Single Function Paste

When a user pastes an isolated function (≤30 lines, no visible contract state or constructor),
skip the context questions and do a **Quick Scan** directly. State:

> "Reviewing this function in isolation. For a full audit including state variables,
> access control, and cross-contract interactions, share the full contract."

Then output: severity-tagged bullet list (Critical/High only unless none found, then include Medium).

---

## Audit Mode Selection

Before starting, identify the audit mode:

| Mode | When to Use | Entry Point |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **Full Audit** | First-time review of a codebase | Phases 1–5 below |
| **Re-audit / Diff** | Previous audit exists; team applied fixes or added features | `references/diff-audit.md` |
| **Integration Review** | Contract integrates Uniswap, Chainlink, Aave, Curve, etc. | `references/defi-integrations.md` + Phase 3 |
| **Quick Scan** | Rapid assessment, limited time | `references/quick-reference.md` — abbreviated Phase 0 (5 min max), run Phases 1–2 only, focus Phase 3 on Critical/High patterns from `quick-reference.md`. **Output:** bullet list of Critical/High findings only; each entry: severity tag, location (`File.sol#L`), one-line description, remediation pointer. No full report structure required. |
| **Contest** | Submitting to Code4rena, Sherlock, Immunefi, Cantina, or CodeHawks | See **Contest Mode** section below — platform-specific output format, strategy, and validity rules |

For severity classification guidance at any point, consult `references/severity-decision-tree.md`.

---

## Contest Mode

**Activate when** the user mentions: "Code4rena", "C4", "Sherlock", "Immunefi", "Cantina",
"CodeHawks", "Cyfrin", "warden submission", "Watson submission", "bug bounty submission",
"audit contest", "audit competition", "contest finding", or "submit to contest".

### Step 0 — Identify the Platform

| Platform | Model | Reward Structure | Severity Used |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Code4rena** | Competitive | H/M split pool; Low = QA pool; Gas = Gas pool | H / M / Low / NC / Gas |
| **Sherlock** | Competitive | H/M split; Low = no payout | H / M only (paid) |
| **Immunefi** | Bug bounty | Tiered fixed payout per severity | Critical / High / Medium / Low |
| **Cantina** | Competitive | H/M/Low reward tiers | Critical / H / M / Low / Info |
| **CodeHawks / Cyfrin** | Competitive | Similar to C4 | H / M / Low / Info / Gas |

Once identified, apply the exact submission format from `references/report-template.md → Contest Submission Format`.

### Step 1 — Scope Verification

Before any review:
- Read the contest README, `scope.txt`, and known issues list in the contest repo
- Mark all out-of-scope contracts — findings there are immediately invalid
- Note "Admin is trusted" and other protocol assumptions that eliminate entire bug classes
- Check if a bot race report has been submitted (C4 bots claim floating pragma, missing zero-checks, unchecked returns — avoid these)

### Step 2 — Priority Stack (Contest ROI)

Contests reward unique, high-impact findings. Allocate review time accordingly:

**Highest ROI → spend 70% of time here:**
- Reentrancy (all variants, especially cross-function and read-only)
- Oracle manipulation (spot price, TWAP bypass, stale feeds)
- Access control gaps on privileged functions
- Business logic errors (incorrect fee math, state machine violations, off-by-one)
- Economic attacks (flash loan vectors, slippage, MEV)

**Medium ROI → spend 25%:**
- Integer precision / rounding direction
- Missing input validation (zero-address, bounds — only if exploitable, not bot-fodder)
- DoS vectors (unbounded loops, griefing with real impact)
- Signature replay / EIP-712 errors

**Low ROI — skip unless trivial to add:**
- Gas optimizations (only if contest has a Gas pool)
- Code style, naming (NC / Info → no payout on most platforms)
- Findings already listed as known issues

### Step 3 — Validity Pre-Check

Before writing each finding, apply this filter:

```
Is there a working attack path an external actor can execute?
├─ No → Invalid (likely rejected)
│
Is the root cause inside the contest scope?
├─ No → Out of scope (invalid)
│
Does the impact require a trusted role (admin, owner)?
├─ Yes, and admin is listed as trusted → Low at best (often invalid)
│
Can the impact be quantified in USD?
├─ Yes → always include the estimate (judges weight concrete impact)
├─ No → describe the qualitative harm precisely
│
Is there a working PoC?
├─ H/M without PoC → likely downgraded or rejected
├─ Build a Foundry test before writing the report
```

### Step 4 — Platform-Specific Rules

**Code4rena:**
- Each H/M = separate GitHub issue; QA findings bundled in one QA report
- Duplicate = same root cause (not same symptom) → split reward pool
- Unique findings with PoC earn the most; first-mover advantage on uncommon bugs
- Link every finding to exact GitHub permalink (commit hash, not branch)
- Use `diff` format in mitigations when possible

**Sherlock:**
- Strict pre-conditions template required: "Internal pre-conditions" + "External pre-conditions"
- `admin is trusted` = admin-abuse findings are invalid (not even Low)
- "Loss of 1 wei" alone = invalid; needs meaningful dollar impact or significant disruption
- Escalation period: Watson escalation reviewed by Senior Watsons; escalate if you believe judge is wrong
- Valid states must persist after the PoC transaction (not reset by next block)

**Immunefi:**
- Bug bounty: disclose privately first; no public disclosure until patched
- Critical/High require a working PoC; Medium may be accepted with clear description
- Impact must be real: "theoretical" or "best case" attacks typically rejected
- Include: affected product version, environment (mainnet/testnet), reproduction steps
- Do not include in contest format — use private disclosure channel

**Cantina / CodeHawks:**
- Similar to C4 in structure; include `Context:` field with exact file + line reference
- CodeHawks requires explicit `Likelihood` and `Impact` labels in addition to combined `Severity`

### Step 5 — Output

Use the exact per-platform format from `references/report-template.md → Contest Submission Format`.

**Do not use private audit report format (no Executive Summary, no Scope section, no Appendix).**

Each finding is standalone and must be independently understandable.
Judges read hundreds of findings — front-load the impact in the first sentence.

## Full Audit Workflow

Execute audits in this order. Each phase builds on the previous one.

### Phase 0 — Threat Modeling

**Audit by Protocol Type — Quick Routing**

| Protocol Type | Primary Reference | DeFi Checklist Section | Key Case Studies |
|---|---|---|---|
| AMM / DEX | `defi-integrations.md §Uniswap` | `defi-checklist.md §AMM` | Curve, Cork Protocol |
| Lending / Borrowing | `defi-integrations.md §Aave` | `defi-checklist.md §Lending` | Euler, Abracadabra |
| Vault / Yield (ERC-4626) | `defi-integrations.md §ERC-4626` | `defi-checklist.md §Vault` | — |
| Bridge / Messaging | `l2-crosschain.md` | `defi-checklist.md §Bridge` | Nomad, Wormhole |
| Governance / DAO | `vulnerability-taxonomy.md §15` | `defi-checklist.md §Governance` | Beanstalk, Compound |
| Perpetual DEX | `perpetual-dex.md` | `defi-checklist.md §Perp` | Hyperliquid HLP |
| LST / Restaking | `staking-consensus.md` | `defi-checklist.md §Restaking` | Bybit |
| Uniswap V4 Hook | `defi-integrations.md §V4-Hooks` | `defi-checklist.md §V4-Hooks` | Cork Protocol |
| ZK / Rollup | `zkvm-specific.md` | `l2-crosschain.md §ZK` | — |
| Account Abstraction | `account-abstraction.md` | `audit-questions.md §AA` | — |
| AI-Generated Code | `ai-code-patterns.md` | `audit-questions.md §AI` | Bybit (supply chain) |
| Intent / Solver | `intent-protocols.md` | `defi-checklist.md §Intents` | — |
| CeDeFi / Synthetic | `vulnerability-taxonomy.md §4.7` | `defi-checklist.md §CeDeFi` | xUSD ($285M) |
| RWA / Tokenized Assets | `rwa-protocols.md` | `defi-checklist.md §RWA` | — |
| Options / Structured Products | `options-protocols.md` | `defi-checklist.md §Options` | Deus DAO, Lyra AVAX |
| Prediction Markets | `prediction-markets.md` | `defi-checklist.md §Prediction` | Polymarket UMA disputes, Augur REP |
| Multisig / Safe Modules | `safe-modules.md` | `defi-checklist.md §Safe` | Radiant Capital |
| Move / Sui / Aptos | `move-security.md` | — (supplement) | Cetus ($223M) |

Before touching code, build a mental model of what the protocol does and what
can go wrong economically. This shapes where you spend time in Phase 3.

1. **Map the actors**: who interacts with this protocol?
   - Unprivileged users, liquidity providers, borrowers
   - Privileged roles: admin, guardian, keeper, fee recipient
   - External actors: MEV bots, flash loan attackers, liquidators, governance participants

2. **Identify the crown jewels**: what assets or rights are at risk?
   - User funds locked in the protocol
   - Protocol-owned reserves or insurance funds
   - Governance control (ability to upgrade, change parameters, drain)

3. **Define critical invariants**: what must NEVER be false?
   - Solvency: total liabilities ≤ total assets
   - Accounting: sum of individual balances = tracked total
   - Access: only authorized callers can execute privileged operations

4. **Trace trust boundaries**: what external systems does this protocol trust?
   - Oracles (Chainlink, TWAP, custom)
   - External protocol integrations (Uniswap, Aave, Curve)
   - Bridging / messaging layers (LayerZero, CCIP, Wormhole)
   - Multisig signers or governance

5. **Estimate MEV surface**: what operations create profitable ordering opportunities?
   - Liquidations, arbitrage, sandwich-able swaps
   - Front-runnable reveals, claims, or settlements

6. **Note upgrade/admin blast radius**: if the admin key or a multisig is compromised,
   what is the maximum damage? Is there a timelock? A pause mechanism?

Output: a 5–10 line threat summary that focuses the manual review in Phase 3 on
the highest-value attack paths. Skip this only for Quick Scan mode.

---

### Phase 1 — Reconnaissance

1. Identify the Solidity version, compiler settings, and framework (Hardhat/Foundry)
2. Map the contract architecture: inheritance tree, library usage, external dependencies
3. Identify the protocol type (DeFi lending, AMM, NFT, governance, bridge, vault, etc.)
4. Determine the trust model: who are the privileged roles? What can they do?
5. List all external integrations (oracles, other protocols, token standards)

### Phase 2 — Automated Analysis

If tools are available in the environment, run them in this order:

```
# Static analysis
slither . --json slither-report.json

# Compile and test
forge build
forge test --gas-report

# Custom detectors (if Aderyn is available)
aderyn .
```

If tools are NOT available, perform manual static analysis covering the same
categories these tools check. Read `references/tool-integration.md` for details.

### Phase 3 — Manual Review (Core)

This is where the highest-value findings come from. Follow the vulnerability
taxonomy in `references/vulnerability-taxonomy.md` systematically.

**Navigation:** Load `references/INDEX-vulns.md` to quickly locate which file:section covers a given vulnerability type or secure pattern. For DeFi-specific topics, load `references/INDEX-defi.md` instead. See `references/INDEX.md` for the full category guide.

**CRITICAL PRIORITY — Check these first:**
- Reentrancy (all variants: cross-function, cross-contract, read-only)
- Access control flaws (missing modifiers, incorrect role checks, unprotected initializers)
- Price oracle manipulation (spot price usage, single oracle dependency, TWAP bypass)
- Flash loan attack vectors
- Proxy/upgrade vulnerabilities (storage collision, uninitialized implementation, UUPS gaps)
- Unchecked external calls and return values
- ERC-7702 delegation risks (if EOAs or authorization tuples are present: malicious delegation target, stale authorization replay, nonce race, re-initialization of delegated code) — see `references/vulnerability-taxonomy.md §17`

**HIGH PRIORITY:**
- Integer overflow/underflow (pre-0.8.x or unchecked blocks)
- Logic errors in business rules (token minting, reward calculations, fee distribution)
- Front-running and MEV exposure (sandwich attacks, transaction ordering dependence)
- Denial of Service vectors (gas griefing, unbounded loops, block gas limit)
- Signature replay and malleability
- Delegatecall to untrusted contracts

**MEDIUM PRIORITY:**
- Gas optimization issues that affect usability
- Missing event emissions for state changes
- Centralization risks and single points of failure
- Timestamp dependence
- Floating pragma versions
- Missing zero-address checks

**LOW / INFORMATIONAL:**
- Code style and readability
- Unused variables and imports
- Missing NatSpec documentation
- Redundant code patterns

### Phase 4 — DeFi-Specific Analysis

When auditing DeFi protocols, apply the specialized checklist from
`references/defi-checklist.md`. Load `references/INDEX-defi.md` to navigate protocol-specific entries and invariant tests. Key areas:

- **Lending protocols**: Liquidation logic, collateral factor manipulation, bad debt scenarios
- **AMMs/DEXs**: Slippage protection, price impact calculations, LP token accounting
- **Vaults/Yield**: Share price manipulation (inflation attack), withdrawal queue logic
- **Bridges**: Message verification, replay protection, validator trust assumptions
- **Governance**: Vote manipulation, flash loan governance attacks, timelock bypass
- **Staking**: Reward calculation precision, stake/unstake timing attacks
- **RWA protocols**: Load `references/rwa-protocols.md` for NAV oracle trust, tranche accounting, epoch redemptions, KYC transfer restrictions, default handling
- **Options protocols**: Load `references/options-protocols.md` for settlement oracle manipulation, IV attacks, collateral/margin, vault strategy risks, multi-leg payoff correctness
- **Prediction markets**: Load `references/prediction-markets.md` for resolution oracle trust, CTF split/merge logic, AMM pricing bounds, market creation attacks, timing/MEV at resolution
- **Safe modules / multisig**: Load `references/safe-modules.md` for module installation lifecycle, delegatecall storage collisions, guard bypass vectors, fallback handler attacks, social recovery, Zodiac framework patterns

### Phase 5 — Report Generation

Structure every finding using this format:

```
## [SEVERITY-ID] Title

**Severity**: Critical | High | Medium | Low | Informational
**Category**: (from vulnerability taxonomy)
**Location**: `ContractName.sol#L42-L58`

### Description
Clear explanation of the vulnerability, why it exists, and what an attacker could do.

### Impact
Concrete description of damage: funds at risk, protocol disruption, data corruption.

### Proof of Concept
Step-by-step exploit scenario or code demonstrating the issue.

### Recommendation
Specific code changes to fix the vulnerability. Include example code when possible.
```

Classify severity following the standard used by Immunefi, Code4rena, and Sherlock:

| Severity | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Critical** | Direct loss of funds, permanent protocol corruption, bypass of all access controls |
| **High** | Conditional loss of funds, significant protocol disruption, privilege escalation |
| **Medium** | Indirect loss, limited impact requiring specific conditions, griefing with cost |
| **Low** | Minor issues, best practice violations, theoretical edge cases |
| **Informational** | Code quality, gas optimizations, documentation gaps |

## Key Patterns to Enforce

### Checks-Effects-Interactions (CEI)
Every function that modifies state and makes external calls must follow CEI.
Verify state changes happen BEFORE any external call.

### Pull Over Push
Favor withdrawal patterns over direct transfers. Let users claim rather than
pushing funds to them automatically.

### Least Privilege
Every function should have the minimum required access level. Prefer role-based
access control (OpenZeppelin AccessControl) over single-owner patterns.

### Defense in Depth
No single security mechanism should be the only protection. Layer reentrancy
guards, access controls, input validation, and invariant checks.

## Important Notes

- Always state clearly if the review is a limited automated scan vs. a full manual audit
- Never guarantee that code is "100% secure" — audits reduce risk, they don't eliminate it
- Flag centralization risks even if they aren't traditional "vulnerabilities"
- Consider the economic incentives: would the exploit be profitable given gas costs?
- Check interactions with common DeFi primitives (flash loans, MEV, composability)
- When in doubt about severity, read how Sherlock, Code4rena, and Immunefi classify similar findings
