# Agent instructions for `hermes-local-knowledge`

These instructions apply to the whole repository.

## Before editing

1. Read `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and `memory.md`.
2. Check `git status --short --branch`; preserve unrelated dirty work.
3. Keep changes focused. Runtime dependencies remain Python standard library only unless a documented product need justifies otherwise.
4. Never commit generated/local state or secrets.

## Documented public boundaries

- Package version is synchronized in `plugin.yaml`, `pyproject.toml`, and `hermes_local_knowledge/__init__.py`.
- The Python plugin entry point is `local_knowledge = hermes_local_knowledge.plugin`; `plugin.register` is the registration boundary.
- Registration provides exactly five native tools (`knowledge_search`, `knowledge_get`, `knowledge_neighbors`, `knowledge_feedback`, `knowledge_usage_report`) and four hooks (`pre_llm_call`, `post_tool_call`, `on_session_end`, `on_session_finalize`).
- `indexer.__all__` is exactly: `Artifact`, `Edge`, `IndexSettings`, `build_index`, `search_index`, `get_artifact`, `get_neighbors`, `main`.
- `python -m hermes_local_knowledge.cli` is the primary standalone CLI. `python -m hermes_local_knowledge.indexer` is the preserved compatibility entry point. `hermes local-knowledge` is the smaller install/doctor surface; its worker command is host-internal.
- Preserve documented configuration aliases and defaults. Do not preserve undocumented private call shapes merely because a test once patched them.
- The three router-skill copies are an intentional packaging/install exception to DRY and must remain byte-identical with one equality assertion in `tests/test_public_contract.py`.

## Current owners

- `config.py`: configuration models and resolution.
- `implicit.py`: default-enabled search-result consumption feedback.
- `artifacts.py`: whole-artifact models, collection, privacy-safe metadata, graph edges.
- `index.py`: format-4 persistence, cross-version/SQLite build locks, rebuild classification, deterministic retrieval.
- `telemetry.py`: usage/feedback persistence and reports.
- `routing.py`: bounded explicit and implicit feedback-assisted routing.
- `evaluation.py`: read-only feedback replay and metrics.
- `service.py`: managed index and telemetry lifecycle for one resolved config.
- `okf.py`: safe OKF queue, hooks, worker, validation, fenced publication.
- `plugin.py`: Hermes tools/hooks/skill/CLI registration.
- `cli.py`: standalone and Hermes CLI adapters.
- `indexer.py`: thin compatibility facade.
- `__init__.py`: package version.

## Product, ranking, and privacy invariants

- Route to whole artifacts; do not introduce chunk RAG without an explicit design change.
- FTS is the primary broad-recall path. Deterministic identity/metadata retrieval is complementary, not a replacement.
- Operational type promotion is narrow and query-gated. Quoted searches, explicit `artifact_type` filters, skill-parent lifting, and global per-parent support-doc diversity must retain their documented behavior.
- Query-terminal artifact-type promotion uses one SQLite read snapshot and one immutable legacy baseline. Eligibility is limit-independent across the complete index, requires a complete configured entity label in the exact target's ID/title/path plus a distinct topic term, never transfers identity across support siblings, and may only apply one stable target/owner move while preserving every unrelated result's relative order.
- Parent-equivalent evaluation only relates a `skill_support_doc` to its owning skill; graph neighbors are not evaluation equivalence.
- Script search text uses routing-safe metadata, never arbitrary body literals.
- Environment names may be routing signals. Environment values, MCP credential values, raw tool arguments/output, transcripts, OCR/private document text, and secret-like schema values must not enter indexed or generated artifacts.
- Keep native model-facing tool responses concise: expose only routing decisions, actionable lookup state, feedback handles, and improvement evidence. Preserve rich index/configuration diagnostics in internal telemetry and CLI/operator surfaces rather than routine agent context.
- `$HERMES_HOME/skills/.archive` is excluded from active routing.
- Feedback/evaluation data stays local. Keep public docs/tests free of raw telemetry and private content.
- Feedback-assisted routing is current-index-root-only and bounded to the latest significant explicit query/artifact rating. Among accepted current ratings, only `useful` is positive; legacy persisted `great` rows remain positive compatibility input. A newer rejection for the route or matching current query vetoes an older overlapping positive. Promote an artifact only when the current index returns it, with at most one no-longer-than-current artifact-type retry. Explicit caller-owned indexes remain unassisted.
- Default-enabled implicit routing uses recent same-turn baseline search-result consumption, deduplicates one search/artifact pair, and requires confirmations from distinct search events. Route-assisted-only results are not evidence. Mature evidence from too many query shapes is treated as generic. Explicit routes take precedence, and implicit evidence never becomes an evaluation label or unbounded historical replay input.
- Read-only evaluation measures the unassisted index ranking. Do not train on and score the same feedback replay.

## State and concurrency invariants

Generated state includes `index.sqlite`, `index.jsonl`, `usage.sqlite`, `okf_queue.sqlite`, `okfs/tools/*.md`, `okf_worker.log`, the v0.3.12-compatible file gate `index_build.lock`, the SQLite transaction lock `index_build.sqlite`, and `okf_index_dirty/`. Do not commit it.

- Managed lookups rebuild missing, corrupt, older-format, or OKF-dirty indexes. Ordinary source changes require `rebuild=true`, an explicit CLI build, or an optional operator schedule; no schedule is required.
- Reject newer index formats before publication. Build and validate temporary SQLite/JSONL outputs before publishing them as a recoverable, hash-bound pair under both build locks.
- OKF automatic generation is enabled by default and must be disclosed as consuming additional model tokens. The finalizer only checks and launches; the detached worker uses one fixed lease, one structured batch call when claims exist, and claim/lease-fenced validation/publication.
- Version 0.4.0 supports the current v0.3.12 queue shape through selected-claim normalization, not a general migration ladder.

## Release policy

A version bump is required when release-relevant paths differ from the base, including:

- `__init__.py`, `plugin.yaml`, `pyproject.toml`, `after-install.md`;
- `hermes_local_knowledge/**`, `examples/**`, and `skills/**`.

Documentation-only edits normally do not require a bump unless accompanied by a release-relevant path.

## Verification

Focused public/plugin contract check:

```bash
PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 python -m pytest \
  tests/test_public_contract.py tests/test_plugin.py \
  -q -p no:cacheprovider
```

Full gate:

```bash
PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 python -m pytest -q -p no:cacheprovider
python -m ruff check .
python -m mypy
python scripts/check_version_policy.py --base-ref origin/main
git diff --check
```

For ranking/index changes, also run a configured build, read-only evaluation, and doctor smoke. For release/package changes, build and installation-smoke both wheel and sdist.

## Repository safety

Keep `.env*`, databases, JSONL indexes, logs, caches, builds, virtualenvs, mutation workspaces, and local state out of commits. This is a public repository: never add credentials, private document contents, raw session transcripts, or identifying telemetry rows.
