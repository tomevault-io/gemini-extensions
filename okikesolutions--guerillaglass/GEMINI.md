## Build, Test, and Development Commands

## Agent Task Verification

**After every task completed, run `bun run gate` to verify that what the agent built is actually working.**

Do not consider a task done until the full gate passes. If it fails, fix the issues (format, lint, tests, or build) and run the gate again before reporting completion.

---

## Platform & Stack

- **Product north star:** cross-platform creator studio with professional record/edit/deliver workflow and cinematic defaults.
- **Desktop shell:** Electrobun + React + Tailwind + shadcn base components.
- **Web landing/auth shell:** TanStack Start + Convex + Tailwind.
- **Native engines:** macOS Swift engine (production baseline), Windows/Linux Rust native engines (parity expansion path), plus protocol-compatible stubs for parallel shell work.
- **Current production capture baseline:** macOS 13.0+ (stretch: validate 12.3+ video-only).
- **Protocol:** Zod (TypeScript) + Swift wire codec.
- **Capture:** macOS uses ScreenCaptureKit/AVFoundation; Windows/Linux evolve toward native parity.
- **Encoding/muxing:** macOS AVFoundation baseline; equivalent native pipelines per platform.
- **Rendering:** deterministic renderer contract across platforms; macOS uses Metal preferred, Core Image acceptable for MVP.

---

## Conventions to Follow

- **Desktop UX:** Prioritize an Electrobun-first desktop UX with clear keyboard navigation, accessible semantics, and platform-appropriate shortcuts. Respect Reduce Motion, Increase Contrast, Reduce Transparency where available.
- **Desktop layout contract:** Treat Guerilla Glass as an editor-first product, not a dashboard. Keep the primary shell anchored around transport + preview + timeline + inspector (with optional source/utility rail), and do not regress to card-dashboard-first layouts for core workflows.
- **Determinism:** Pre-encode frame buffers must be deterministic (same project + version + settings + hardware class ⇒ pixel-identical frames). Encoding bytes are not guaranteed identical. Tests hash pre-encode frames; update rendering determinism tests when changing the pipeline.
- **Permissions:** Screen Recording required; Microphone and Input Monitoring only when those features are enabled. If Input Monitoring is denied, recording continues but auto-zoom/click highlights are disabled—UI must show degraded mode clearly.
- **Versioning:** Project schema always migrates forward on load; never write older schema versions.
- **Mezzanine (v1):** H.264 mezzanine, high bitrate, short GOP / frequent keyframes.

---

## Phased Delivery Context

- **Phase 1:** Production-grade macOS capture/export path + editor-first Creator Studio shell.
- **Phase 2:** Cinematic defaults (event tracking, auto-zoom, framing, vertical export) + Windows/Linux parity expansion.
- **Phase 3:** Motion blur/segment polish + cross-platform workflow polish parity.

When adding features, align with the current phase in `docs/ROADMAP.md` and the capability matrix in the spec (§5).

---

## Testing Guidelines

- Determinism validated by hashing pre-encode frames; update `Tests/renderingDeterminismTests/` when changing the pipeline.
- Baseline targets (Apple Silicon M1/M2): capture dropped frames ≤ 0.5%, avg CPU ≤ 20%; export ≤ 1.5× realtime for 1080p/60.
- Tag issues/PRs appropriately: `bug`, `feature`, `good first issue`, `help wanted`, `design`, `performance`.
- Run `bun run gate` before pushing when you touch Swift logic; CI runs the same gate (see `.github/workflows/full_gate.yml`).
- Run `bun run desktop:test:coverage` when touching `apps/desktop-electrobun` or protocol packages (`packages/engine-protocol`, `packages/review-protocol`).
- Pure test additions/fixes generally do **not** need a changelog entry unless they alter user-facing behavior.

---

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

- Prefer concise, action-oriented commit messages (e.g. `Capture: add keyframe interval to mezzanine`, `UI: respect Reduce Motion in preview`).
- Group related changes; avoid bundling unrelated refactors.
- PRs should summarize scope, note testing performed (including full gate), and mention any user-facing changes.
- Before merging: run `bun run gate` locally; ensure CI passes.
- Changelog: keep latest released version at top; add entries for user-facing changes and reference issues/PRs as in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

---

## Agent-Specific Notes

- **Vocabulary:** “Guerilla Glass” / “Guerillaglass” for the product; `guerillaglass` for bundle/binary/paths as used in the project.
- Never edit generated or vendored artifacts outside the documented workflows; prefer project scripts and configs.
- When working on a GitHub Issue or PR, print the full URL at the end of the task.
- When answering questions, respond with high-confidence answers only; verify in code when possible.
- **Full gate:** After every completed task, run `bun run gate` to verify the build and tests; do not report task completion until the gate passes.
- Lint/format churn: if changes are formatting-only, auto-resolve without asking; only ask when changes are semantic (logic/data/behavior).
- Focus reports on your edits; when multiple agents touch the same area, continue if safe and note “other files present” only if relevant.
- Bug investigations: read relevant source and dependencies before concluding; aim for high-confidence root cause.
- Do not change version numbers or release artifacts without explicit approval; see `CONTRIBUTING.md` and the spec for release steps.
