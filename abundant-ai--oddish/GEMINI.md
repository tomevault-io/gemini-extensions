# Oddish Repository Guide

This file is the technical guide for the entire monorepo. End-user CLI docs live in `DOCS.md`.

The repo has three main packages:

- `oddish/` — the core Python CLI, FastAPI server, queueing layer, and worker runtime
- `backend/` — the hosted cloud layer built on top of `oddish`; adds multi-tenant auth, Modal deployment, and product-specific endpoints
- `frontend/` — the Next.js App Router dashboard and public pages

Python `3.12+` is required for `oddish` and `backend`. Node.js `20+` and `pnpm` are required for `frontend`.

## Maintenance Notes

- Keep `oddish/README.md` focused on end-user CLI workflows.
- Put `oddish` implementation details, architecture notes, and local development guidance here.
- If you change the CLI surface in `oddish/src/oddish/cli/`, update `oddish/README.md`.
- If you change API contracts, queue behavior, or storage layout, update this file.
- If you change `backend/` auth, deployment, or worker orchestration, update this file.
- If you change `frontend/` routing, API proxy structure, or auth behavior, update this file.

## System Architecture

```text

        |
        v

        |
        v

           or backend cloud layer (Modal / Railway)
        |
        v
Postgres
  - worker_jobs       # unified queue (TRIAL / QA / …)
  - trials / tasks    # domain state + live UI columns
  - queue_slots       # per-queue-key concurrency leases
        |
        v
Workers (auto-started by API, or standalone via python -m oddish.workers.queue.worker)
        |
        v
Harbor task execution → logs/results/artifacts (S3)
```

High-level flow:

1. Upload a task bundle directly to S3 via a presigned PUT URL.
2. Submit a sweep of agent/model trials for that task; each trial is
   enqueued as a `worker_jobs` row in the same transaction as its domain
   row. Set `max_trial_attempts` on a sweep submission or sweep config to
   override the total attempt budget for newly-created trials.
3. Workers claim one `worker_jobs` row at a time, dispatch to the registered
   handler (`TRIAL` / `QA`), write heartbeats, and exit.
4. Trajectory analysis is **task-scoped**: when every trial of a
   `run_analysis` task is terminal, a single `QA` job is enqueued. That one
   job classifies every live trial's trajectory (same taxonomy / evidence /
   reasoning, written to `trials.analysis`) and then synthesizes the task
   verdict (`tasks.verdict`). A sweep of `T` tasks × `N` trials therefore
   enqueues `T` QA jobs instead of `T × (N + 1)`. (The pre-refactor per-trial
   `ANALYSIS` and per-task `VERDICT` kinds are kept as legacy enum values only
   so historical / in-flight rows remain valid and drain across a deploy;
   nothing enqueues them anymore. `trials.analysis` holds the per-trial
   classification and `tasks.verdict` the task-level result — both are outputs
   of the one QA job.)
5. Use the CLI or dashboard to watch progress and pull logs/artifacts
   back locally.

## Package Boundaries

`oddish` owns the execution core and shared queue/runtime primitives:

- core models and migrations, including `worker_jobs` and `queue_slots`
- unified claim/dispatch SQL, one `run_single_worker_job` runner, and a
 handler registry (`TrialJobHandler`, `QaJobHandler`, plus the legacy
 `AnalysisJobHandler` kept to drain in-flight rows)
- the task-level QA job (`run_task_qa_job`): classify every live trial via
 the shared `classify_trial_and_store`, then synthesize the task verdict
- shared queue-slot leasing, per-queue-key concurrency limits, and
 per-user fairness on `TRIAL` claims
- stale-heartbeat reaping, RETRYING → QUEUED mirror-back, and pipeline
 stage reconciliation in one cleanup sweep
- soft-delete semantics on domain rows via the `deleted_at` column and
 a session-level filter (`oddish.db.soft_delete`); every ORM read on a
 registered model gets `WHERE deleted_at IS NULL` automatically

`backend` wraps `oddish` with the hosted-only layer:

- Clerk/API key auth and org-scoped APIs
- Modal worker spawning and runtime patching
- cloud environment policy and GitHub notification hooks
- public sharing routes and other product-specific endpoints

`frontend` provides the user-facing layer:

- authenticated dashboard, task browser, experiment views
- Clerk-based auth and org management
- Next.js route handlers that proxy requests to the backend

## `oddish/` — Core Package

### Install Extras

The base `pip install oddish` is CLI-only (light deps). Use extras for server and worker use cases:

```bash
pip install oddish            # CLI only — typer, httpx, pydantic, harbor
pip install oddish[server]    # + FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, asyncpg, alembic, aioboto3
pip install oddish[worker]    # + server + LLM provider SDKs
pip install oddish[all]       # everything including dev tools
```

### Entry Points

- CLI: `oddish` → `oddish.cli:app`
- API server: `python -m oddish.server` (requires `oddish[server]`)
- Standalone worker: `python -m oddish.workers.queue.worker` (requires `oddish[worker]`)
- DB helper CLI: `python -m oddish.db` (requires `oddish[server]`)
- Queue key backfill: `python -m oddish.backfill_queue_keys`

### Soft Delete

Every model that mixes in `TimestampedMixin` has a `deleted_at` column,
but only the classes registered through
`oddish.db.soft_delete.register_soft_delete_models` participate in the
session-level auto-filter:

| Package | Soft-deletable models |
|---------|------------------------|
| `oddish.db.models` | `ExperimentModel`, `TaskModel`, `TrialModel` |
| `backend.models` | `OrganizationModel`, `UserModel`, `APIKeyModel` |

Behavior:

- ORM `SELECT` / `UPDATE` / `DELETE` issued through a session pick up
  `WHERE deleted_at IS NULL` automatically, including eager-loaded
  relationships (`selectinload`, `joinedload`) and aliased subqueries.
- The DELETE endpoints (`delete_task_core`, `delete_experiment_core`,
  `delete_trial_core`) tombstone rows via `UPDATE ... SET deleted_at = NOW()`
  and cancel any matching `worker_jobs` rows. They return an empty
  `s3_prefixes` list so caller best-effort S3 cleanup is a no-op --
  S3 data is preserved for restore.
- The `task_experiments` join table also carries `deleted_at` so experiment
  membership is preserved for audit/restore. Because it is a SQLAlchemy
  `Table`, not a registered model, live membership queries and relationship
  joins must explicitly include `task_experiments.deleted_at IS NULL`.
- Raw `text()` SQL doesn't run through the ORM listener; the dispatcher
  claim path (`worker_job_single_job.py`), cleanup sweep, and admin
  diagnostics each add `deleted_at IS NULL` inline.
- The `(org_id, name)` uniqueness on `tasks` is a **partial** unique
  index (`WHERE deleted_at IS NULL`) so a deleted task's name slot is
  reusable.
- To read or rewrite tombstoned rows (admin tooling, future restore
  flows) opt out per statement:
  `session.execute(stmt.execution_options(include_deleted=True))`.

### Worker Runtime (`oddish.workers.queue`)

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `worker_job_dispatcher.py` | `discover_active_worker_job_queue_keys`, `get_worker_job_org_queue_counts`, `build_spawn_plan` (org-first fair-share, with within-org round-robin across queue_keys) |
| `worker_job_single_job.py` | `_CLAIM_WORKER_JOB_SQL`, `run_single_worker_job`, `heartbeat_worker_job` |
| `trial_handler.py` | TRIAL execution body |
| `qa_handler.py` | Task-level QA job: `run_task_qa_job` classifies every live trial then synthesizes the verdict |
| `analysis_handler.py` | `classify_trial_and_store` (shared per-trial classifier) + the transitional `run_analysis_job` wrapper for in-flight legacy ANALYSIS rows |
| `cleanup.py` | Zombie reaper, stale-heartbeat sweep, stage safety nets, **per-slot** orphaned-slot release (see invariants below) |
| `slots.py` | `queue_slots` lease acquire/release (`locked_by` / `locked_until` / `locked_at`) |
| `queue_manager.py` | Per-queue-key concurrency bookkeeping |
| `worker.py` | Standalone poll loop (`python -m oddish.workers.queue.worker`) |

Handler registration lives in `oddish.workers.jobs` (`registry.py`,
`handlers.py`). Both the standalone worker and the backend call
`ensure_builtin_handlers_registered()` at startup.

### Local Development

You need a running Postgres instance. Start one however you prefer (e.g.
`docker run -d --name oddish-db -e POSTGRES_USER=oddish -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=oddish -e POSTGRES_DB=oddish -p 5432:5432 postgres:16-alpine`),
then:

```bash
cd oddish
cp env.example .env
uv sync --extra server
uv run python -m oddish.db setup
uv run python -m oddish.server
```

That gives you:

- the API on `http://localhost:8000`
- background workers started by the API process

Point the CLI at your local server:

```bash
export ODDISH_API_URL="http://localhost:8000"
```

For the hosted Oddish API instead, keep the default API URL and set:

```bash
export ODDISH_API_KEY="ok_..."
```

### Standalone Workers

`python -m oddish.server` auto-starts workers by default. If you want separate
worker processes for scaling or debugging:

```bash
uv run python -m oddish.workers.queue.worker
```

### Database Commands

```bash
uv run python -m oddish.db init    # run Alembic migrations
uv run python -m oddish.db setup   # alias for init
uv run python -m oddish.db reset   # drop and recreate all tables
uv run python -m oddish.db purge   # delete data, preserve migration state
```

### API Server Flags

```bash
uv run python -m oddish.server --host 0.0.0.0 --port 9000
uv run python -m oddish.server --n-concurrent '{"openai/gpt-5.2": 8, "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5": 8}'
```

### HTTP Endpoints (core)

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
|--------|----------|---------|
| POST | `/tasks/upload/init` | Prepare a task upload and return a presigned PUT URL when S3 is enabled |
| POST | `/tasks/upload/complete` | Finalize a direct-to-S3 task upload after the client PUT succeeds |
| GET | `/health` | API and DB health check |
| POST | `/tasks/sweep` | Expand a sweep into a task plus trials |
| GET | `/tasks` | List tasks |
| GET | `/tasks/{task_id}` | Fetch a task with trials |
| POST | `/tasks/cancel` | Cancel many tasks in one request |
| DELETE | `/tasks/{task_id}` | Soft-delete a task and its trials (sets `deleted_at`; S3 artifacts are preserved for restore) |
| POST | `/tasks/{task_id}/qa/retry` | (Re)run the single task-level QA job: reset every live trial's classification + the verdict, then classify all trials and synthesize a fresh verdict |
| POST | `/tasks/{task_id}/qa/cancel` | Cancel a task's in-flight QA job |
| POST | `/experiments/combine` | Create a new experiment that merges the task memberships and finished trials (with artifacts) of two or more source experiments |
| DELETE | `/experiments/{experiment_id}` | Soft-delete an experiment, its trials, and any now-orphaned tasks |
| PATCH | `/experiments/{experiment_id}` | Update experiment metadata |
| GET | `/tasks/{task_id}/trials/{index}` | Fetch a trial by 0-based index |

### Claude model routing: AWS Bedrock only

**oddish runs Claude exclusively through AWS Bedrock.** The Modal image
bakes in `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK=1`, and Claude Code authenticates with
`AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK` from the runtime Modal secret. There is no
Anthropic API route — `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is not used for trials.

Claude Code invokes Bedrock via the legacy `InvokeModel` API, which only
accepts **cross-region inference profile ids** (a `global.`/`us.`/... prefix)
or ARNs. A bare `anthropic.claude-...` foundation-model id is *not* invokable
on-demand — Bedrock rejects it with "Retry your request with the ID or ARN
of an inference profile". So `harbor_runner` normalizes whatever model id a
trial supplies via `oddish.config.to_bedrock_model_id` before handing it to
Harbor. That normalizer accepts any of these forms:

- already invokable (`global.`/`us.`/... inference profiles,
  `arn:aws:bedrock:...`) — passed through, minus any redundant `bedrock/`
  prefix.
- Anthropic-style (`anthropic/claude-opus-4-8`, bare `claude-opus-4-8`) **or**
  a bare Bedrock foundation-model id (`anthropic.claude-opus-4-8`) — mapped to
  an invokable inference profile id via the explicit
  `_ANTHROPIC_TO_BEDROCK_MODEL_IDS` table in `oddish/config.py`. **A Claude
  model with no table entry raises a `ValueError`** — add an entry there
  before running that model.
- non-Claude models (`openai/...`, `gemini-...`) — passed through untouched.

The table maps to `global.` inference profiles (recommended by AWS, no
pricing premium) except Opus 4.1 / Opus 4, which have no global profile and
use `us.`. If you need regional data residency, change the prefixes there.

You can pass any of those forms anywhere a model is accepted: `oddish run
-m ...`, sweep configs (`model_name:`), or `--n-concurrent` overrides.
Concurrency limits are keyed off the full `provider/model` string.

> Trial *analysis* (the `claude -p` classifier) uses its own `ANALYSIS_MODEL`
> (`oddish/config.py`), which is already a `global.` inference profile id. It
> is not wired through `to_bedrock_model_id`.

### GLM / z.ai routing (Claude Code harness, non-Bedrock)

z.ai's GLM models are served over an **Anthropic-compatible `/messages`
endpoint**, so they run on the `claude-code` harness — but they must *not*
inherit claude-code's fixed Bedrock provider/queue, or they would contend with
heavy Bedrock/Anthropic traffic for the same concurrency slots. oddish handles
this with a dedicated z.ai route:

- **Canonical id.** Any GLM/z.ai reference is canonicalized to `zai/<id>` by
  `oddish.config.to_zai_model_id` inside `normalize_trial_model`. Recognized
  inputs: an explicit `zai/`/`z-ai/`/`z.ai/` prefix, or a bare `glm...` id
  (e.g. `glm-x-preview[1m]`, `glm-4.6`). `zai` is a litellm provider id, so the
  trial's `provider` resolves to `zai` and its `queue_key` to `zai/<id>` —
  a separate concurrency bucket from any Bedrock model. The `zai/` prefix is
  kept on the model id handed to Harbor so its per-agent network allowlist
  resolves `api.z.ai` for closed-internet tasks.
- **Env injection.** For a `claude-code` agent on a GLM model,
  `harbor_runner._apply_claude_code_zai_env` mirrors the OpenRouter path: it
  sets `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` (default `https://api.z.ai/api/anthropic`,
  overridable via `ZAI_BASE_URL`), `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN=${ZAI_API_KEY}`
  (resolved by Harbor's Modal env at exec time), pins `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` and all
  size aliases to the **bare** GLM id, applies z.ai's recommended long-context
  settings (`CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS`, `API_TIMEOUT_MS`,
  `CLAUDE_STREAM_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS`, `CLAUDE_CODE_EAGER_FLUSH`,
  `CLAUDE_CODE_AUTO_COMPACT_WINDOW`), and blanks the ambient
  `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK` / `AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK`
  so the z.ai route wins over the image's Bedrock defaults. Any of these can be
  overridden per-trial via the sweep `env:` / CLI `--agent-env`.
- **Secret.** Provide `ZAI_API_KEY` in the runtime Modal secret (or the worker
  environment). It is referenced as `${ZAI_API_KEY}` and never persisted to the
  trial row.

- **Recommended thinking/effort.** z.ai recommends "max effort" with adaptive
  thinking. Harbor's `claude-code` agent (pinned fork commit) already renders
  the `thinking` and `reasoning_effort` kwargs as `--thinking adaptive
  --effort max`, so the z.ai route sets those kwargs as defaults. Override
  either per-trial via agent kwargs (`--agent-kwarg reasoning_effort=high`).
- **Network allowlist.** The Harbor fork's per-agent allowlist already maps
  `zai`/`z-ai`/`glm` model prefixes (and the `glm-claude-code` agent name) to
  `api.z.ai`, so closed-internet tasks on the Modal environment reach z.ai
  without further changes.

Run GLM on a task: `oddish run -p <task> --agent claude-code --model
zai/glm-x-preview[1m]` (bare `glm-x-preview[1m]` works too and is canonicalized
to `zai/...`).

### MiniMax / Moonshot (Kimi) routing (Claude Code harness, direct APIs)

MiniMax and Moonshot both expose **Anthropic-compatible `/messages` endpoints**,
so MiniMax M-series and Kimi K2.7 Code run on the `claude-code` harness against
their official direct APIs — the same pattern as GLM/z.ai, and the reason these
are preferred over the OpenRouter route (one stable endpoint per provider,
trivially allowlisted on closed-internet tasks; no OpenRouter provider-routing
variance). oddish gives each its own provider/queue bucket so they never contend
with Bedrock for concurrency slots:

- **Canonical id.** `oddish.config.normalize_trial_model` canonicalizes any
  MiniMax reference to `minimax/<id>` (via `to_minimax_model_id`) and any
  Moonshot/Kimi reference to `moonshot/<id>` (via `to_moonshot_model_id`).
  - MiniMax inputs: an explicit `minimax/` prefix or a bare `minimax...` id
    (e.g. `MiniMax-M3`). Model ids are lowercased for storage/queueing
    (`minimax/minimax-m3`); the exact published casing (`MiniMax-M3`) is
    restored only when the id is handed to Claude Code (`minimax_api_model_id`).
  - Moonshot inputs: an explicit `moonshot/`/`moonshotai/`/`kimi/` prefix or a
    truly bare `kimi-...` id (e.g. `kimi-k2.7-code`). **A foreign provider
    prefix such as `openrouter/moonshotai/kimi-...` is intentionally *not*
    matched**, so the OpenRouter route keeps its own provider/queue bucket and
    both columns can run concurrently.
  - `minimax`/`moonshot` resolve to their own `provider` and `queue_key`
    (`moonshot` is a litellm provider id; `minimax` is an oddish alias). The
    provider prefix is kept on the id handed to Harbor so its per-agent network
    allowlist resolves the direct endpoint for closed-internet tasks.
- **Env injection.** For a `claude-code` agent on a MiniMax/Moonshot model,
  `harbor_runner._apply_claude_code_minimax_env` /
  `_apply_claude_code_moonshot_env` mirror the z.ai path: they set
  `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` (defaults `https://api.minimax.io/anthropic` /
  `https://api.moonshot.ai/anthropic`, overridable via `MINIMAX_BASE_URL` /
  `MOONSHOT_BASE_URL`), `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN=${MINIMAX_API_KEY}` /
  `${MOONSHOT_API_KEY}` (resolved by Harbor's Modal env at exec time), pin
  `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` and all size aliases to the bare model id, apply each
  provider's recommended long-context env (MiniMax:
  `CLAUDE_CODE_AUTO_COMPACT_WINDOW=512000` for M3's 512K window,
  `API_TIMEOUT_MS`, `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_NONESSENTIAL_TRAFFIC`; Moonshot:
  `CLAUDE_CODE_AUTO_COMPACT_WINDOW=262144` for K2.7's 256K window,
  `ENABLE_TOOL_SEARCH=false`, `CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS=32768`), and blank
  the ambient `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK` /
  `AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK` so the direct route wins. **No thinking/effort
  kwargs are set** — MiniMax M3 has thinking on by default and K2.7 locks
  temperature/top_p server-side with thinking always on.
- **Secret.** Provide `MINIMAX_API_KEY` / `MOONSHOT_API_KEY` in the runtime
  Modal secret (or the worker environment). They are referenced as
  `${MINIMAX_API_KEY}` / `${MOONSHOT_API_KEY}` and never persisted to the trial
  row.
- **Network allowlist.** The Harbor fork's per-agent allowlist maps the
  `minimax` and `moonshot`/`moonshotai`/`kimi` model prefixes (and the
  dedicated `minimax-claude-code` / `kimi-claude-code` agent names) to
  `api.minimax.io` / `api.moonshot.ai`, so closed-internet tasks reach the
  direct endpoints without further changes.

Dedicated Harbor agents `minimax-claude-code` and `kimi-claude-code` (subclasses
of `claude-code`, with closed-internet `*-api-key-no-search` variants) also
exist for direct `harbor run` usage; the oddish production path uses the stock
`claude-code` agent plus the env injection above.

Run MiniMax / Kimi on a task: `oddish run -p <task> --agent claude-code --model
minimax/MiniMax-M3` and `oddish run -p <task> --agent claude-code --model
moonshot/kimi-k2.7-code` (bare `MiniMax-M3` / `kimi-k2.7-code` work too and are
canonicalized).

Storage defaults:

- S3-compatible storage is **required**. Clients PUT task bundles directly
  to a presigned URL returned by `/tasks/upload/init` and then call
  `/tasks/upload/complete`.
- uploaded task bundles: `tasks/<task_id>/.oddish-task.tar.gz`
- Harbor job outputs: `/tmp/harbor-jobs`
- Modal workers also check `/mnt/oddish-tasks` before falling back to the S3 download path

## `backend/` — Hosted Cloud Layer

### Authentication Model

The backend accepts auth from `Authorization`, `X-Clerk-Authorization`, or `X-Authorization`.

- **API keys** (`ok_...`): stored hashed (SHA-256) in `api_keys`; scopes are `full`, `tasks`, `read`
- **Clerk JWTs**: validated against Clerk JWKS; org context extracted from token claims

Auth flow: read token → if `ok_` prefix validate API key → otherwise validate Clerk JWT and resolve org/user → return `AuthContext`.

If a Clerk JWT arrives without `org_id`, the backend tries to resolve a single existing org membership, or provisions a personal org.

### Worker Architecture

Dispatcher + reconciler + single-job pattern, backed by the unified
`worker_jobs` table. **Dispatch and reconciliation are deliberately separate
scheduled functions** so a slow or deadlocking reconciliation sweep can never
block worker spawning (previously they shared one function under a tight 60s
timeout, so a sweep that timed out or deadlocked spawned zero workers that
cycle — and a SIGKILL mid-sweep left orphaned `idle in transaction` locks that
deadlocked the next sweep):

1. `poll_queue()` runs on a `POLL_INTERVAL_SECONDS` (180s) Modal schedule under
   `DISPATCHER_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` (120s). It does only two things: discover active
   queue keys via `discover_active_worker_job_queue_keys`, and launch up to
   `MAX_WORKERS_PER_POLL` single-job containers via the org-first fair-share
   `build_spawn_plan`. It runs no cleanup, so dispatch is never blocked by it.
   `MAX_WORKERS_PER_POLL` is the dominant throughput ceiling: long agent trials
   hold a `queue_slots` lease for their full duration, so steady-state running
   workers ≈ `spawns_per_poll × trial_duration / poll_interval`. It must stay
   high enough to fill the per-model concurrency limits (which sum into the
   hundreds); the per-queue-key slot caps and `WORKER_MAX_CONTAINERS` remain the
   real bounds.
2. `reconcile_queue_state()` runs on its own `CLEANUP_INTERVAL_SECONDS` (240s)
   schedule under a generous `CLEANUP_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` (600s) so it is never
   SIGKILLed mid-transaction. It runs (each phase wrapped best-effort so one
   failure doesn't abort the rest): stale `queue_slots` lease cleanup,
   `cleanup_orphaned_queue_state` (zombie-txn reap + stale-heartbeat sweep +
   stage safety nets + **per-slot** orphaned slot release — see "Worker runtime
   invariants" below), and the experiments owner
   backfill (`dashboard_owner_backfill` — converges `owner_user_id` so the
   dashboard Mine filter stays on its indexed fast path). The display-hygiene
   clear of terminal-trial claim metadata
   (`clear_terminal_trial_runtime_refs`) runs after the main reconciliation
   transaction commits, in batched `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` transactions, so it
   can neither deadlock against live workers nor roll back the sweep.
3. `process_single_job(queue_key)` acquires a `queue_slots` lease for the
   queue key (stamping `locked_by = <worker_id>`, `locked_at = NOW()`,
   `locked_until = NOW() + WORKER_TIMEOUT + 30s`) and calls
   `run_single_worker_job` → `drain_worker_jobs`, which atomically claims one or
   more rows from `worker_jobs` (stamping `current_worker_id = <worker_id>`),
   dispatches to the registered handler (`TRIAL` or the task-level `QA` job;
   `ANALYSIS` only for legacy in-flight rows), writes heartbeats on both
   `worker_jobs.heartbeat_at` and the mirrored domain column, records the
   outcome (`SUCCESS` / `RETRYING` / `FAILED` / `CANCELLED`), runs the
   post-success hook (GitHub notification) when applicable, releases the slot
   in its `finally`, and exits.

Handler registration happens at container load via
`ensure_builtin_handlers_registered()`. Post-success hooks
(`notify_github_trial`, `notify_github_qa`, and the transitional
`notify_github_analysis`) are wired through `_POST_SUCCESS_HOOKS` in
`worker/functions.py`. The task-level `QA` job fires `notify_github_qa`,
which refreshes the whole PR comment (per-trial classifications + task
verdict) in one update.

### Worker Runtime Invariants & Pitfalls

Load-bearing properties, several learned from incidents. Changing them naively
silently breaks throughput or correctness — read before touching
`worker/functions.py`, `slots.py`, `cleanup.py`, or the dispatcher.

1. **Workers hold NO DB connection during the Harbor run.** A trial runs for
   minutes to ~12h but only touches the DB for a few ms (claim, 30s heartbeats,
   outcome), so workers use `NullPool` (`Settings.db_use_null_pool`) + per-op
   `asyncpg` connections. ⚠️ Never introduce a pooled/long-lived connection or
   open session spanning the run: it pins one idle connection per running trial
   and exhausts the Supavisor/PgBouncer cap. (The API keeps a warm `QueuePool`
   only because it's short-lived — that reasoning doesn't transfer to workers.)

2. **`queue_slots` is the real concurrency gate.** Per-queue-key concurrency is
   enforced by leasing a `queue_slots` row (`acquire_queue_slot`, `FOR UPDATE
   SKIP LOCKED`), not by spawn count. The dispatcher budgets on `worker_jobs`
   RUNNING (`limit - running`) while the worker gates on a free slot — if those
   counters drift, the dispatcher over-spawns workers that exit immediately
   (watch for `metric=queue_lock_contention` floods).

3. **Slot leases can outlive their worker — reclaim per-slot.** The lease
   (`locked_until`) is `WORKER_TIMEOUT_SECONDS + 30` (~12h); a SIGKILLed /
   preempted worker never runs its `finally` release. `cleanup_orphaned_queue_state`
   frees a slot whenever its `locked_by` has no `RUNNING` `worker_jobs` row on
   `current_worker_id` (with a `locked_at` grace, `ORPHANED_SLOT_GRACE_MINUTES`,
   for the acquire→claim gap). ⚠️ Never gate this per-queue_key (e.g. "release
   only if zero jobs RUNNING on the key") — that was the original bug: one live
   job pinned every leaked lease for ~12h and starved the queue. The link is
   always `queue_slots.locked_by == worker_jobs.current_worker_id`.

4. **One model ⇒ one queue_key.** Limits key off the full `queue_key`; the same
   model under two keys gets the *sum* of both buckets against one provider quota
   (→ 429s, split dashboards, starvation). Canonicalize at enqueue in
   `oddish.config` (`normalize_trial_model` / `get_queue_key_for_trial` /
   `normalize_queue_key`): nop/oracle + variants collapse to the single
   `nop_oracle` id (`is_nop_oracle_agent`); z.ai / MiniMax / Moonshot map to
   `<provider>/<id>`. ⚠️ Known gap: Gemini isn't canonicalized — a bare
   `gemini-…` becomes `google/…` while `gemini/…` stays `gemini/…`, splitting one
   model across two buckets.

5. **No provider-level concurrency cap.** Each Bedrock/Gemini model id is its own
   bucket, but they share one AWS/Google account quota — the sum of per-model
   limits can exceed account RPM/TPM with no global throttle (a source of 429s).

6. **Stale-heartbeat reap can double-run a trial.** If heartbeats stall for
   `STALE_HEARTBEAT_MINUTES` (15, e.g. a pooler blip), the reaper flips the live
   trial to `RETRYING` and another worker may run it concurrently — no fencing
   token. The window is a deliberate trade-off (raised from 10 after an incident);
   shrink with care.

```bash
# Modal local serve
cd backend
uv sync
uv run modal serve deploy.py
```

### Configuration (backend)

```bash
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
```

Minimum required:

```bash

```

Required for Clerk-backed org management:

```bash

Hosted API containers keep a conservative warm SQLAlchemy pool by default so
Modal bursts do not overrun shared Postgres poolers. The engine still disables
prepared statement caching so it remains compatible with transaction-mode
poolers such as Supavisor / PgBouncer.

## `frontend/` — Next.js Dashboard

### App Surface

- `/` — public landing page; signed-in users are redirected to `/dashboard`
- `/dashboard` — main dashboard and experiment entrypoint
- `/tasks` — authenticated task browser with search, pagination, version summaries
- `/experiments/[experiment]` — experiment detail, task and trial inspection, logs, results, files, version history, share controls, cancel. Trajectory QA is a single task-level action: the trials table toolbar exposes one **Run QA** / **Cancel QA** per selected task, `TaskFilesPanel` exposes one **Run QA** button, and `TaskVerdictBadge` renders the unified QA state (**Running QA…** / **QA failed** / **Task is good** / **Needs review**) with **Run QA** / **Cancel QA**. Per-trial analysis run/cancel controls were removed (the trial drawer still shows each trial's classification read-only); Run QA proxies to `POST /tasks/{id}/qa/retry` and Cancel QA to `POST /tasks/{id}/qa/cancel`.
- `/settings` — organization and API key management
- `/admin` — two tabs:
  - **Worker Jobs** (default): unified `worker_jobs` kind×status matrix
    (`Task QA` is the task-level `QA` job; `Task Verdict` and `Trial Analysis`
    are shown as legacy and only drain in-flight rows), stale-RUNNING samples, recent
    failures/cancels, duration percentiles, plus `OrphanedStateCard`
  - **Concurrency**: `queue_slots` leases and per-queue-key health
- `/share/[token]` — read-only public experiment view. Passes `showAnalysis={false}` to `ExperimentDetailView`, which hides all QA UI (matrix classification dots, the "Trial analysis" legend section, the trial classification card, and the task QA verdict badge) from public viewers.
- `/datasets` and `/datasets/[token]` — public dataset listing and detail

### Request Flow

```text
Browser UI
  -> Next.js pages and client components
  -> Next.js route handlers in src/app/api/*
  -> backend API (FastAPI or Modal)
```

The backend URL is configured via `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` in `src/lib/backend-config.ts`.

Dashboard and experiment detail pages seed client-side SWR from their server
render and suppress the immediate mount revalidation when the fallback payload
already matches the default view. The route handlers for
`src/app/api/dashboard/route.ts` and
`src/app/api/experiments/[experiment]/tasks/route.ts` emit `Server-Timing`
headers and forward upstream timing data for latency debugging. The backend
dashboard aggregation now stays on a single DB session per request to avoid
doubling connection pressure during bursts. Experiment-scoped task responses
include `experiment_created_at`, sourced from `ExperimentModel.created_at`, so
the experiment header does not infer creation time from one of its tasks.

### Local Development

```bash
cd frontend
pnpm install
cp env.example .env.local
# set NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY, CLERK_SECRET_KEY, NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Scripts

```bash
pnpm dev           # Next.js dev server
pnpm build         # Production build
pnpm start         # Run production server
pnpm lint          # ESLint
pnpm format        # Prettier formatting
pnpm format:check  # Check Prettier formatting
```

### Configuration (frontend)

```bash
# Required
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000

# Recommended for org-aware backend auth
CLERK_JWT_TEMPLATE=oddish

# Optional
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_IN_URL=/dashboard
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_UP_URL=/dashboard
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://local.oddish.app
```

### Auth

Public routes: `/`, `/sign-in/*`, `/sign-up/*`, `/share/*`, `/datasets/*`, `/api/public/*`. Everything else is protected by Clerk middleware.

Clerk JWT template claims:

```json
{
  "email": "{{user.primary_email_address}}",
  "org_id": "{{org.id}}",
  "org_role": "{{org.role}}"
}
```

### Deployment

```bash
docker build -t oddish-frontend frontend/
docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 --env-file frontend/.env.local oddish-frontend
```

### UI Stack

- Next.js 15 App Router, React 19
- Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Radix primitives
- SWR for client-side data fetching
- Clerk for auth
- Recharts, Shiki, @tanstack/react-virtual

## Full-Stack Local Development

### Frontend + (ephemeral) Modal backend

Two workflows, both documented in detail in [`SELF_HOSTING.md`](SELF_HOSTING.md):

1. **Plain HTTP localhost** (Clerk *test* keys):

   ```bash
   # Terminal 1
   cd backend && uv run modal serve deploy.py

   # Terminal 2 — set NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL to the modal serve URL
   cd frontend && pnpm dev
   ```

2. **Local HTTPS on `local.oddish.app`** (Clerk *production* keys). The helper
   script listens on port 443 and re-execs itself under `sudo`, so the
   root-owned `.next/` from a prior run has to be cleared:

   ```bash
   # Terminal 1
   cd backend && uv run modal serve deploy.py

   # Terminal 2 — ensures Clerk prod keys accept the oddish.app origin
   cd frontend && sudo rm -rf .next && ./run-prod-clerk-local.sh
   ```

   `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` in `.env.local` should point at the `-dev` Modal URL
   from Terminal 1, and `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` should be
   `https://local.oddish.app`.

Use `modal deploy deploy.py` for production deployments (see `SELF_HOSTING.md`).


---

## Troubleshooting

### API does not start

```bash
uv run python -m oddish.db setup
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

### Pulling from a remote API fails

- Verify `ODDISH_API_URL` and `ODDISH_API_KEY`.
- Try `oddish status` first to confirm auth and connectivity.

### Frontend "Failed to fetch" or disconnected backend

```bash
curl ${NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL:-http://localhost:8000}/openapi.json
```

### Clerk auth issues

- Verify Clerk keys in `frontend/.env.local`.
- If org-scoped backend access fails, confirm `CLERK_JWT_TEMPLATE` is set and includes `org_id`.
- If using production Clerk keys locally, use `frontend/run-prod-clerk-local.sh`.
