# cma-test — "launch your managed agent" skill

## What this project is
A Claude Code **skill** (`launch-your-agent`) that helps a **technical founder** build whatever they want on **Claude Managed Agents (CMA)** — an internal worker, a piece of their product, a customer-facing agent; recurring or one-off: interview → build kit → launch → eval → iterate → scheduled deployment (when it should run on a clock). General-purpose, not a workshop — no clock/"hour" framing, no "recurring task" requirement; the spine is an iterative lens (scope a v0, launch and grade it, layer upgrades as v1/v2 via NEXT-DIRECTIONS).

## Repo map (state as of 2026-06-15)
| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `cma-primitives.md` | Full inventory of CMA primitives/limits from the live docs (incl. **scheduled deployments** at `/managed-agents/scheduled-deployments`) |
| `.claude/skills/launch-your-agent/references/examples-bank.md` | **Sourced-only** archetypes (each traced to an official cookbook/doc), production proof-point links, §5 = other-ideas backlog |
| `ui/agent-overview-example.html` + `ui/build-sheet.example.json` | The overview page example (live-schema dashboard, kept identical to the skill's `overview-template.html`) + example build sheet — open locally in a browser |
| `.claude/skills/launch-your-agent/` | **The skill**: SKILL.md (4 phases) + references/ (interview, cma-api, examples-bank, overview-template, build-sheet example). Also installed at `~/.claude/skills/launch-your-agent/` for testing — keep both copies in sync (repo is the source of truth). |
| `.claude/skills/wrap-up/` | **Companion skill** `/wrap-up`: owns the close-out / status check for a built agent (overview regen, primitives recap, run log, tailored extensions, hygiene sweep). Reuses launch-your-agent's references via `../launch-your-agent/references/`. Installed at `~/.claude/skills/wrap-up/`. launch-your-agent's Phase 4 invokes it. |

## Key decisions
- Audience: technical founder, self-directed, inside Claude Code. Show the machinery (curl/`ant`), don't hide it.
- **Build what they need, scoped into versions** (not "defaults until earned"): starting point is one agent, **Opus-class by default** (Sonnet when speed/cost matters more for the use case), full toolset, cloud env, **Outcome kickoff** (`user.define_outcome`, max_iterations 3), drafts-only — but any primitive (connector, memory, custom tool/skill, schedule) goes in v0 if the core job needs it and it's wireable now; everything else is laid out as numbered v1/v2 increments in NEXT-DIRECTIONS.
- **Open light, boundaries in context**: the opening is a couple of warm sentences + 2–3 archetype examples + the open question — no version vocabulary, no boundaries block, no process talk. Caveats/guardrails are raised briefly at the moment they matter. After the founder's first answer, **let them explain** (one open follow-up) before any suggestions, reshaping, or AskUserQuestion menus. Then one cluster at a time, AskUserQuestion for enumerable choices, max one open-ended question per turn.
- **Don't undersell**: keep hard limits (sub-second latency, live phone calls) separate from defaults — building a UI on top of the agent is fine (that's the generated-interface extension, not a limitation); gated write-actions (`always_ask`, paper/sandbox variants) are possible even in v0 if the founder wants them; drafts-first is the recommendation, not a "never".
- **No spend-limit step** — the iteration bound (`max_iterations: 3`) is the only quiet cost default; mention runs cost cents, nothing required in the Console.
- **Never stop to wait for the key — heads-up early, hand over late**: as soon as a credential is inevitable (API key, connector token/webhook), tell the founder where to get it (a "grab these while I stage" table rides with the brief) so they fetch in parallel; stage everything keyless meanwhile. Easiest handover: **check the shell env first** (many founders will already have it exported — skip the ask if so); otherwise pre-create `my-agent/.env` (chmod 600, gitignored) and the founder either pastes the key into it via its absolute path or exports it in their own terminal — whichever is quicker for them. Only hard rule: never into chat. Key that touches a transcript ⇒ rotate.
- **Connectors are named, not hidden — and mockable**: when delivery is asked for (email/Slack/etc.), state the guardrail (drafts-only + `always_ask` gate) and the connector route. Slack and email both take real setup (app/OAuth/webhook + vault), so the **default is mock-in-v0, wire-for-real in v1**; if the founder wants to wire it now, do it — pull the latest connector docs first. Don't underbuild: if the core job needs a connector (credential on hand) or a memory store, it goes in v0, not deferred reflexively. Mocking = outbox of schema-true payloads or stubbed custom tool — `references/mock-connectors.md` has the patterns + typical endpoint schemas — so v1 is just the swap to the real MCP server + vault.
- **Voice**: warm welcome, no clinical process talk, no time estimates or unverified durations; compact/dense messages with tables; consistent emoji shorthand for primitives (🤖 📦 🎯 ▶️ 🗓️ 🔌 🔐 🧠 🧪) used in the brief, at ✅ checkpoints, and in the recap; **primitives keep their real names** (Outcome not "definition of done", Deployment not "schedule", Vault, Memory store, Evals — overview cards renamed to match), each with a plain gloss on first use; our own process shorthand stays plain ("the plan / your agent's folder", not "build kit"); deferrals always tagged not-possible vs needs-credential vs out-of-scope; next steps said once at the wrap-up, plus 1–2 extensions tailored to their use case; pre-build read-back is a "CMA-shaped brief" (primitives table + v1/v2 section + eval table) approved via AskUserQuestion.
- **Next directions** (not "roadmap"/"guardrails"): whenever something doesn't belong in v0, Claude writes it to NEXT-DIRECTIONS.md *in the moment* with what/why-deferred/how, slotted into a numbered version (v1, v2, …) so it reads as planned releases — "not yet" always comes with "here's exactly how, in v1".
- **Celebratory close, owned by `/wrap-up`**: launch-your-agent's Phase 4 finalizes NEXT-DIRECTIONS then invokes `/wrap-up`. The close is a moment, not a checklist read-out: congratulate them on shipping a managed agent → overview page reopened → "here's what you built" (primitives recap table: primitive · what it is · what we set · live ID · which overview card shows it · unused → NEXT-DIRECTIONS, plus run log) → "here's what's next" (1–2 tailored extensions). Hygiene sweep runs quietly — fix silently, surface only what the founder must act on; **no cost notes** anywhere unless asked. Dashboard/recap always show the full model slug (e.g. `claude-opus-4-8`), never just "Opus-class".
- **Evals**: founder's real past cases = golden set; case 1 is the build input, rest held back; rubric is the per-run grader; no past cases ⇒ today's verified output is saved as case 1 at close; re-run evals before promoting a new agent version to the deployment.
- **Overview page is describe-only but styled as a live schema** (warm-light schematic: trigger → worker-in-environment → output & grading nodes, run-log lane, version rail — not doc cards; kept skimmable: no never-dos or audience prose on the page; Console still covers live observability), is **regenerated by Claude Code as a workflow step**, and is the **closing interface**: reopened in the browser at the end with run log, verdicts, schedule, and Console links. A **generated interface** (graphical output, results viewer over the Files/Sessions API, or a way to interact with the agent — whatever suits the need) is a standard *tailored extension* offer — never a v0 default.
- **Scheduled deployments**: native (`POST /v1/deployments`, cron+timezone, manual `/run` test, explicit `-X POST`) — the Phase 4 finale **when the use case is actually recurring** (don't schedule one-off or event-driven agents just to have a finale). `initial_events` are replayed verbatim, so kickoff text must use relative dates, never literal ones.
- **Sourcing rule** for examples: only officially-grounded examples in the interview menu; our own ideas live in examples-bank §5 (other-ideas backlog).

## Testing the skill
- Trigger: `/launch-your-agent` (project or installed copy); `/wrap-up` for the close-out.
- **Run tests inside `test-runs/run-NN/`** (gitignored scratch space, safe to delete) so the generated `./my-agent/` folder doesn't pollute the repo root.
- During a test, log every friction point / missing instruction; fix SKILL.md + references in the **repo** copy, then re-sync to `~/.claude/skills/`.
- Test-run logs and outstanding follow-ups live in `CLAUDE.local.md` (untracked), not here.
