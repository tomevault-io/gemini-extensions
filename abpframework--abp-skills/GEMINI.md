# CLAUDE.md — working on this repo

This is an AI hand-off guide. Read it before making changes. It's terse on purpose;
`README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `RELEASING.md`, `eng/compat/README.md`, and
`eng/runtime/README.md` have the long form.

## What this is

A curated set of **ABP Framework** agent skills, distributed as **15 versioned
plugins / 80 skills** to four AI coding tools (Claude Code, Codex CLI, Cursor,
VS Code/Copilot). One set of Markdown skill content, published through four
per-tool marketplace manifests. Scope: ABP Framework development (building and
extending modules through the framework's extension points), not tutorials.

## Repo layout (key paths)

eng/                           # validators, eval harness, A/B experiment, baselines, unit tests
```

## Quality gates — run the full sweep before claiming "done"

```bash
python3 eng/validate.py                 # layout/manifest/frontmatter/menu-budget
python3 eng/validate_evals.py           # eval schema + 100% skill coverage + unique names
python3 eng/verify_compat_coverage.py   # every skill: C# smoke OR exemption
python3 eng/check_version_annotations.py # "ABP 10.6+" symbols registered + #if ABP_NEXT
python3 eng/verify_baselines.py         # AbpVersion consistent across props/eng/runtime/ts/README/workflows
python3 -m unittest discover -s eng -p 'test_*.py'
dotnet build eng/compat/AbpSkillsCompat.slnx                                   # stable 10.5.0
dotnet build eng/compat/AbpSkillsCompat.slnx -p:AbpVersion=10.6.0-rc.1 -p:AbpNext=true  # next ABP
dotnet test  eng/runtime/AbpRuntimeTests.csproj                                # runtime behavior
(cd eng/compat-ts && npm ci && npm ls @abp/ng.core @angular/core && npm run build)
(cd eng/compat-ts-extensible && npm ci && npm run build)   # no `npm ls` here (see gotchas)
npx --yes markdownlint-cli2@0.23.0
actionlint    # needs shellcheck on PATH; also in .github/workflows/actionlint.yml
```

All must be green. `git diff --check` too. CI runs the same set in
`.github/workflows/validate.yml` (PR/push) and `release.yml` (tag).

## Conventions

- **SKILL.md frontmatter**: `name` (== folder name, globally unique — routing is
  name-based), `description` (≤1024 chars, **no angle brackets `<>`**, must contain
  `USE FOR:` and `DO NOT USE FOR:` markers with sibling-skill routing), `license: MIT`.
- **Framework code in examples**: match ABP idiom; new framework methods a customer
  might override default to `protected virtual`.
- **No hedging or unverifiable claims in shipped content.** Every claim must be
  source-verifiable (see next section); the maintainers are responsible for verifying
  all content. Follow the organization's commit policy and don't add false attribution.
- **Central Package Management**: `eng/compat/` and `eng/runtime/` each have a
  `Directory.Packages.props`. Do NOT hard-code `Version="..."` on `PackageReference`;
  add a `PackageVersion` to the props (ABP packages use `$(AbpVersion)`).
- **Marketplace/plugin descriptions**: if you change a plugin's description, update
  all 6 places (plugin.json, .codex-plugin/plugin.json, 4 marketplace.json).

## Verifying content against ABP source (mandatory)

Every ABP API/behavior claim needs source evidence. Read the real files:

- Check out the ABP source at the baselines recorded in `eng/abp-baselines.yaml`:
  **rel-10.5** is the compile baseline and the `blob/rel-10.5/...` doc links in skills;
  **rel-10.6** is the content-review baseline (use `git show <commit>:<path>` for the
  exact commit). ABP Studio (Studio CLI / templates) is in the `abp-studio` repo.
- Grep for the type/method, confirm it exists with the signature you're writing, note
  `file:line`. Independent reviewers (see next) have caught real bugs from prose that
looked right but wasn't (e.g. `SetUseCurrentAccessToken` vs a non-existent property,
`DeleteDirectAsync` provider differences, `KnownNetworks` deprecated in net10).

## Test-coverage: tiers and the blind audit

Tests fall in three tiers:

- **T2** — real behavior: a `eng/runtime/*.cs` `[Fact]` boots an ABP app and asserts, or
  an executable eval. **Only these prove behavior.**
- **T1** — compile-smoke only (`eng/compat/Skills/*.cs` or `eng/compat-ts*/*.ts`): proves the
  API exists, not that it behaves. The smoke must reference the skill's load-bearing API.
- **T0** — keyword eval only, or exempt from compile-smoke (CLI / decision / TS-only
  skills with no C# surface). The current exempt set is listed in
  `eng/compat/coverage-exemptions.yaml`; these need heavy harnesses or have no compile
  surface (low ROI).

Independent confirmation runs via **codex** (stateless = blind). Run `codex exec` from
the repo root with a read-only sandbox and a neutral prompt (no prior findings), then
review its report against the ABP source before acting on it.

## How to add a runtime behavior test (the common task now)

The `eng/runtime/` project boots real ABP apps. Reuse the existing modules:

- `RuntimeTestModule` — no-DB app (auth, validation, settings, caching, mapping,
  events, interceptors). Add a service/handler here; xUnit test in `RuntimeBehaviorTests.cs`.
- `EfCoreTestModule` — in-memory SQLite (soft-delete, UOW, multitenancy, repos,
  seeding, extra properties). Tests in `EfCoreBehaviorTests.cs`.
- `webapp/` SUT + `WebBehaviorTests.cs` — real HTTP (MVC 200/302, CORS, health,
  forwarded headers, conventional controllers). **Reuse this for any HTTP behavior.**

Pattern: add the ABP wiring to a module + a `[Fact]` that asserts the behavior;
make it red-green (it must fail if the behavior breaks); confirm the package is in
the right `Directory.Packages.props`; run the sweep. Do NOT add trivial tests for
pure-config skills (e.g. "GuidGenerator returns a Guid") — the compile-smoke suffices.

## Known constraints & gotchas

- **`@abp/ng.components` breaks the main compat-ts** — it pulls `@abp/ng.theme.shared`
  → `@swimlane/ngx-datatable`, whose Angular peer caps at 20, so `npm ls` fails on
  Angular 21. That's why `extend-angular-module-ui` lives in the separate
  `eng/compat-ts-extensible/` (Angular 20) workspace, built with `npm ci && npm run build`
  **only** (no `npm ls`; the invalid ngx-datatable peer is harmless there).
- **WebApplicationFactory content-root** — needs a *separate* Web SDK SUT project
  (`eng/runtime/webapp/`) referenced by the test project, so `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Testing`
  generates the content-root attribute. An in-test-assembly host fails without a solution.
  The SUT module must `[DependsOn(AbpAspNetCoreTestBaseModule)]` (for `ITestServerAccessor`).
- **Distributed lock** default (`MedallionAbpDistributedLock`) needs a Medallion provider —
  no zero-config in-memory default; skipped as not worth a provider dependency.
- `KnownNetworks` is deprecated in net10 → use `KnownIPNetworks`.
- Local build shows `NU1507` (multiple NuGet sources) and `NU1903` (test-only SQLitePCLRaw
  advisory) — environmental/test-only, documented in `eng/compat/README.md`, not blockers.
