# Diction Gateway -- Agent Reference

Machine-legible reference for the Diction self-hosted gateway. Covers routes, wire formats,
environment variables, capabilities, and what the gateway can and cannot do.

## Overview

The gateway is a Go HTTP service that sits between the Diction iOS app and one or more
OpenAI-compatible speech-to-text backends. It handles:

- WebSocket streaming for low-latency transcription
- HTTP transcription fallback
- Optional LLM post-processing (transcript cleanup, voice editing, suggestions)
- Optional trial token auth (Diction One -- not for self-hosters)

> WARNING: TEXT_ROUTES_OPEN=false (default). /v1/text/* routes return 403 until
> you explicitly set TEXT_ROUTES_OPEN=true or AUTH_ENABLED=true. This is a
> deliberate speed bump -- not a security control. Set it before calling those routes.

## Routes

### GET /health

Health check. Returns 200 when the gateway is up.

```
Response: 200 OK
Body: "ok"
```

### GET /v1/models

Lists configured speech backends (OpenAI-compatible + Diction legacy grouping).
Also includes a top-level capabilities object describing what this gateway instance
can do (additive -- never removes data[] or providers[]).

```
Response: 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "object": "list",
  "data": [
    { "id": "nvidia/parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3", "object": "model", "created": 0, "owned_by": "nvidia" }
  ],
  "providers": [
    {
      "id": "parakeet",
      "name": "NVIDIA Parakeet",
      "models": [{ "id": "parakeet-v3", "name": "Parakeet v3", "description": "...", "available": true }]
    }
  ],
  "capabilities": {
    "llm": true,
    "text_process": true,
    "text_suggest": true
  }
}
```

**capabilities object:**

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|-------|------|---------|
| `llm` | bool | LLM_BASE_URL + LLM_MODEL are set and LLM is active |
| `text_process` | bool | /v1/text/process is open (llm=true AND TEXT_ROUTES_OPEN=true, or auth=true) |
| `text_suggest` | bool | /v1/text/suggest is open (same condition as text_process) |
| `text_summarize` | bool | /v1/text/summarize is open (same condition as text_process) |
| `formatting` | bool | the `formatting` context key is honoured on cleanup (llm=true) |

### POST /v1/trial

Issues a trial token for Diction One cloud subscription. Not useful for self-hosters
(requires TRIAL_SECRET to be configured with Diction's server-side secret).

```
Request body: {"device_id": "<UUID>"}
Response 200: {"token": "<hmac-token>", "expires_at": "<RFC3339>"}
Response 503: {"error":"trial_not_configured"}  -- TRIAL_SECRET not set
Response 409: {"error":"trial_already_used"}  -- trial already consumed
```

### POST /v1/audio/transcriptions

Transcribes an audio file. OpenAI-compatible multipart form upload.

```
Request: multipart/form-data
  file=<audio>
  model=<model-id>        (optional, defaults to DEFAULT_MODEL)
  language=<bcp47>        (optional)
  prompt=<string>         (optional, Whisper prompt hint)
  response_format=json|text  (optional, default json)

Response 200:
  Content-Type: application/json
  X-Diction-Whisper-Ms: <int>
  X-Diction-Route-Model: <model-id>
  X-Diction-LLM-Ms: <int>  (only when LLM ran)
  Body: {"text": "<transcript>"}
```

Append `?enhance=true` to request LLM cleanup. If LLM is not configured,
the raw transcript is returned -- transcription never fails due to LLM issues.

### WS /v1/audio/stream

WebSocket streaming transcription. Used by the Diction iOS app for live transcription
as you speak. Not part of any standard API. Binary audio frames in, JSON text frames out.

Not suitable for scripting -- use /v1/audio/transcriptions for batch use.

### POST /v1/text/process

**Plaintext JSON -- no E2E encryption. Bearer token optional.**

Applies LLM post-processing to text with an explicit intent. Used by the iOS app
for voice editing and transcript cleanup outside the transcription flow.

Requires LLM to be configured (LLM_BASE_URL + LLM_MODEL) and either:
- TEXT_ROUTES_OPEN=true, or
- AUTH_ENABLED=true with a valid bearer token

Returns 403 {"error":"text_routes_closed"} if neither condition is met.
Returns 503 {"error":"llm_not_configured"} if LLM env vars are not set.
Returns 400 {"error":"e2e not supported on this gateway"} if X-Diction-E2E header is present.

```
Request:
  POST /v1/text/process?intent=<intent>
  Content-Type: application/json
  Authorization: Bearer <token>  (optional)

  {
    "text": "<text or instruction>",
    "context": "<JSON string, see below>"
  }

context fields (all optional; `context` itself is a JSON *string*, not an object):
  before          string    text before the user's cursor
  after           string    text after the user's cursor
  selected        string    the user's selection, for intent=edit-selected
  customWords     array     user vocabulary. Objects [{"word":"Diction"}] or plain
                            strings ["Diction"] are both accepted. Cap 50.
  tone            string    how the user wants to be written for. Cap 500 chars.
  profile         string    who the user is. Merged with `tone` into one block.
  sessionContext  [string]  accepted and IGNORED by the cleanup prompt (see note below).
  clipboard       string    accepted and IGNORED by the cleanup prompt (see note below).
  formatting      bool      opt-out; absent or true = formatting rules on.
  language        string    transcript language, or "auto" to infer.

Caps are counted in characters, not bytes.

Note on `sessionContext` / `clipboard` / cursor text: decoded, never forwarded to the cleanup
prompt. They are prose, and an untuned prompt emits prose as its answer -- measured against
gpt-oss-20b, a session block replaced the user's dictation with earlier transcripts and a long
clipboard was appended verbatim. Only descriptive context (customWords, tone, profile) is
forwarded. The cursor text IS sent for intent=edit, where it is the subject of the edit.

intent values:
  (empty) or "transcribe"  -- cleanup prompt, text is the transcript. The transcript leads
                              the user message; each context field present follows as its
                              own labelled line, and absent ones are omitted entirely.
  "edit"                   -- edit prompt, text is the spoken instruction. The user message
                              is "Text: <before>‸<after>" + "Instruction: <text>", where ‸
                              marks the cursor. The model must return the FULL modified
                              text; the gateway strips any ‸ left in the reply. Requires
                              `before` or `after`.
  "edit-selected"          -- edit-selected prompt, applies instruction to selected text.
                              Requires `selected`.

Response 200:
  {"text": "<result>", "mode": "<intent>"}

`mode` is always present and is one of "transcribe", "edit", "edit-selected" — derived from
the request's intent, never inferred from what the user said. The audio endpoints
(/v1/audio/transcriptions, /v1/audio/stream) report it the same way in their result frames.

On edit failure:
  "edit"          --> 500 {"error":"processing failed"}
  "edit-selected" --> 200 {"text":"<original-selected>","mode":"edit-selected","status":"failed"}
  transcribe      --> 200 {"text":"<original-text>","mode":"transcribe"}  (raw fallback)

An edit request with nothing to edit (intent=edit with no before/after, or
intent=edit-selected with no selected) is an edit failure, not a cleanup: the gateway will
not fall back to processing the spoken instruction as if it were dictation.
```

### POST /v1/text/suggest

**Plaintext JSON -- no E2E encryption. Bearer token optional.**

Asks the LLM for 2-3 alternative phrasings of the selected text.
Always soft-fails: returns {"suggestions":[]} on any LLM error.

Same auth requirements as /v1/text/process.

```
Request:
  POST /v1/text/suggest
  Content-Type: application/json

  {
    "selected": "<selected text>",
    "before": "<context before selection>",
    "after": "<context after selection>",
    "customWords": ["word1", "word2"]
  }

Response 200:
  {"suggestions": ["alt 1", "alt 2", "alt 3"]}

Response 503:
  {"error": "llm_not_configured"}
```

### POST /v1/text/summarize

**Plaintext JSON -- no E2E encryption. Bearer token optional.**

Produces a one-line summary of a whole saved note, for a History list preview.
Whole-note operation: no cursor, selection or surrounding context.

Notes shorter than 50 words are skipped without calling the LLM and return
`summary_status: "too_short"` -- a short note is already its own summary.

Always soft-fails: any LLM error returns 200 with `summary_status: "failed"`,
never a 5xx. A missing summary costs a nicer History row and nothing else.

Request bodies are capped at 8 KB.

Same auth requirements as /v1/text/process.

```
Request:
  POST /v1/text/summarize
  Content-Type: application/json

  {
    "text": "<cleaned note text>",
    "language": "en"
  }

Response 200:
  {"summary": "Move Tuesday meeting; follow up on pricing", "summary_status": "succeeded"}
  {"summary": null, "summary_status": "too_short"}
  {"summary": null, "summary_status": "failed"}

Response 400:
  {"error": "text field required"}

Response 413:
  {"error": "request body too large"}

Response 503:
  {"error": "llm_not_configured"}
```

### Formatting flag (cleanup only)

`POST /v1/text/process` accepts a `formatting` boolean inside the `context` JSON.
It is opt-out: absent or `true` appends `LLM_PROMPT_FORMATTING` to the cleanup
prompt, so spoken lists and topic changes come back as line breaks and plain-text
bullets. Only an explicit `false` disables it. Ignored for edit intents, where the
user's own instruction already states the shape of the result.

```
  {"text": "...", "context": "{\"formatting\":false}"}
```

## Default Prompts

When a prompt env var is empty (or file read fails), the gateway uses these built-in defaults:

**LLM_PROMPT (cleanup):**
```
You are a transcript cleanup tool. Fix grammar, punctuation, and remove filler words. Return only the corrected text, nothing else.
```

**LLM_PROMPT_EDIT:**
```
You are a text editor. Apply the user's spoken instruction to the text. Return only the edited result, nothing else.
```

**LLM_PROMPT_EDIT_SELECTED:**
```
You are a text editor. Apply the user's spoken instruction to the selected portion of text. Return only the edited selection, nothing else.
```

**LLM_PROMPT_SUGGEST:**
```
Suggest 2-3 concise alternative phrasings or corrections for the selected text. Return a JSON array of strings only, no explanation.
```

## What the Gateway Can and Cannot Do

**Can:**
- Transcribe speech via any OpenAI-compatible STT backend
- Stream live transcription over WebSocket
- Clean up transcripts using a BYO LLM (cleanup, edit, edit-selected)
- Suggest alternative phrasings (suggest intent)
- Probe health of speech backends
- Issue and verify trial tokens (Diction One only)

**Cannot:**
- E2E encrypt text routes -- /v1/text/* is plaintext only. E2E is a Diction cloud feature.
- Summarize arbitrary text -- summarize is a Diction cloud-only feature.
- Store audio -- audio is transcribed and discarded.
- TTS -- /v1/audio/speech is not implemented.
- SSE streaming on REST -- use WebSocket /v1/audio/stream instead.

## Wire Format Notes

- /v1/text/* endpoints are plaintext JSON. The X-Diction-E2E header must never appear on requests to these routes.
- /v1/audio/transcriptions and /v1/audio/stream may be E2E-encrypted when called by the Diction iOS app pointed at diction.cloud. Self-hosted gateways will never see E2E requests in normal operation.
- Error shape: `{"error":"<code>"}` for most errors. Auth failures: `{"error":"unauthorized","reason":"...","message":"..."}`.
- The suggest endpoint always returns 200 with `{"suggestions":[]}` on LLM error (soft-fail). Never 5xx.
