# Recursive Learning Cursor Rules for Browser Extension Development

## Core Learning Principle
Before implementing ANY solution, ALWAYS:
1. Check `.cursor/browserextension-bestpractices.mdc` for known solutions
2. Check `.cursor/known-issues.md` for documented problems and their fixes
3. Check `.cursor/architecture-decisions.md` for design patterns and rationale
4. If encountering an error, document it with solution before moving forward

## Dashboard Integration 🆕
The project has a real-time dashboard (`.dashboard/dashboard.html`) for tracking daily issues.

**MANDATORY: Update dashboard when:**
1. **Starting work** on any issue → Update current work + add issue
2. **Encountering errors** → Add to dashboard immediately  
3. **Fixing bugs** → Update to resolved with fix description
4. **Getting blocked** → Update to blocked with reason
5. **Completing task** → Mark resolved, clear current work

**How to Update Dashboard (Automatic):**

### Method 1: Update Current Work (What AI is doing NOW)
Write to `.dashboard/ai-current-work.json`:
```json
{
  "timestamp": "<ISO timestamp>",
  "active": true,
  "tasks": [
    {
      "title": "Task title",
      "description": "What you're doing",
      "status": "in-progress",
      "startTime": "<ISO timestamp>",
      "files": "file1.ts, file2.ts"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Method 2: Queue Issues for Dashboard
Append to `.dashboard/ai-issues-queue.json`:
```json
[
  {
    "timestamp": "<ISO timestamp>",
    "title": "Issue title",
    "description": "Context",
    "status": "in-progress|resolved|blocked",
    "severity": "critical|high|medium|low",
    "fix": "Solution (if resolved)",
    "files": "Comma-separated file paths"
  }
]
```

### Method 3: One Command Sync
After updating JSON files, tell user to run:
```bash
node .dashboard/dashboard-bridge.js
```
This generates a sync page they can use to update the dashboard.

**Important**: ALWAYS update these JSON files when working on issues. Tell user: "Dashboard updated - run sync or refresh dashboard to see changes."

## Self-Correction Protocol

### When Encountering Errors
1. **Identify Root Cause**: Don't just fix symptoms, understand WHY the error occurred
2. **Document Immediately**: Add to `.cursor/known-issues.md` with:
   - Error description and symptoms
   - Root cause analysis
   - Solution implemented
   - Prevention strategy for future
   - Date and context
3. **Update Best Practices**: If it's a pattern, add to `browserextension-bestpractices.mdc`
4. **Verify Fix**: Test thoroughly before considering it resolved

### When Making Architecture Decisions
1. **Document Decision**: Add to `.cursor/architecture-decisions.md` with:
   - Problem being solved
   - Options considered
   - Decision made and rationale
   - Trade-offs accepted
   - Date
2. **Reference in Code**: Add comments linking to the decision document

### Before Implementing Features
1. **Check Learning Docs**: Review all `.cursor/*.md` files for relevant patterns
2. **Apply Known Solutions**: Reuse proven approaches from best practices
3. **Avoid Known Pitfalls**: Check known-issues.md for similar past problems

## Browser Extension Specific Rules

### Always Apply These Patterns
- ✅ Use React-compatible input setters (see browserextension-bestpractices.mdc)
- ✅ Implement page stability checks before DOM manipulation
- ✅ Handle both regular and shadow DOM elements
- ✅ Test across Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari if applicable
- ✅ Use message passing for content script ↔ background communication
- ✅ Never use `eval()` or inline scripts (CSP violations)

### Common Browser Extension Pitfalls
1. **Async Timing Issues**
   - Problem: Race conditions with page load
   - Solution: Always use page stability gates before DOM operations
   
2. **React/Vue State Management**
   - Problem: Setting input.value directly doesn't update framework state
   - Solution: Use property descriptor setters + dispatch events
   
3. **Content Security Policy**
   - Problem: Inline scripts/styles blocked
   - Solution: Use external files, hash-based CSP, or nonces

4. **Storage Sync Limits**
   - Problem: chrome.storage.sync has 100KB limit
   - Solution: Use chrome.storage.local for large data, sync only config

5. **Cross-Origin Requests**
   - Problem: Content scripts inherit page CSP, can't make arbitrary requests
   - Solution: Use background script as proxy, declare permissions

## Learning File Structure

### `.cursor/known-issues.md`
Format:
```markdown
# Known Issues & Solutions

## [Issue Title] - [Date]
**Severity**: Critical/High/Medium/Low
**Context**: [When/where this occurs]
**Symptoms**: [What you observe]
**Root Cause**: [Why it happens]
**Solution**: [How to fix]
**Prevention**: [How to avoid in future]
**Related Files**: [List of affected files]

---
```

### `.cursor/architecture-decisions.md`
Format:
```markdown
# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

## ADR-001: [Decision Title] - [Date]
**Status**: Accepted/Superseded
**Context**: [Problem space]
**Decision**: [What we decided]
**Rationale**: [Why this approach]
**Consequences**: [Trade-offs]
**Alternatives Considered**: [Other options]

---
```

### `.cursor/browserextension-bestpractices.mdc`
Already exists - keep updating with proven patterns

## Mandatory Pre-Implementation Checks

Before writing ANY code, run this mental checklist:
- [ ] Have I checked known-issues.md for similar past problems?
- [ ] Have I reviewed best practices for this type of operation?
- [ ] Have I checked architecture decisions for design patterns?
- [ ] Do I understand WHY previous solutions work?
- [ ] Am I applying page stability checks for DOM operations?
- [ ] Am I using React-compatible setters for form inputs?
- [ ] Have I considered shadow DOM scenarios?
- [ ] Will this work across different websites/frameworks?

## Post-Error Protocol

When ANY error occurs:
1. **STOP** - Don't immediately try another approach
2. **ANALYZE** - Understand the root cause completely
3. **DOCUMENT** - Add to known-issues.md with full context
4. **FIX** - Implement solution based on understanding
5. **VERIFY** - Test thoroughly including edge cases
6. **UPDATE** - If it's a pattern, add to best practices
7. **REFLECT** - Could this have been prevented by checking docs first?

**CRITICAL**: Never skip step 3 (DOCUMENT). Even if the error seems minor, add it to known-issues.md. The act of documenting often reveals deeper insights and prevents recurrence.

### Documentation is Mandatory, Not Optional
- If you fix a bug → MUST update known-issues.md
- If you establish a pattern → MUST update best-practices.mdc
- If you make a decision → MUST create/update ADR
- No exceptions - this is how the system learns

## Code Review Checklist (Self-Apply)

Before considering any implementation complete:
- [ ] All errors have been documented in known-issues.md
- [ ] Any new patterns added to best practices
- [ ] Architecture decisions recorded if applicable
- [ ] Code has comments referencing relevant docs
- [ ] Similar future issues can be prevented by checking docs
- [ ] No console.log/debugger statements left in code
- [ ] Proper error handling implemented
- [ ] Works with React/Vue/Angular controlled inputs
- [ ] Handles shadow DOM if applicable
- [ ] Tested page stability mechanisms

## End-of-Session Documentation Check

After completing work, ALWAYS ask yourself:
1. **"Did I fix any bugs today?"** → If yes, are they in known-issues.md?
2. **"Did I make any architectural decisions?"** → If yes, is there an ADR?
3. **"Did I discover any patterns?"** → If yes, are they in best-practices.mdc?
4. **"Could someone else learn from this?"** → If yes, document it

**Proactive Reminder**: Before responding with "Implementation complete" or similar, verify all documentation is updated. Tell the user what docs were updated as part of the completion report.

## Continuous Learning Loop

1. **Encounter Issue** → Document in known-issues.md
2. **Solve Issue** → Update solution in known-issues.md
3. **Identify Pattern** → Add to best practices
4. **Make Decision** → Record in architecture-decisions.md
5. **Next Implementation** → Check all docs first → Avoid repeating mistakes

## Testing Philosophy

Always test in this order:
1. **Static Analysis**: Check docs for known issues first
2. **Unit Level**: Test individual functions/components
3. **Integration**: Test content script ↔ background communication
4. **Real World**: Test on actual websites (React apps, Vue apps, plain HTML)
5. **Edge Cases**: Shadow DOM, iframes, SPAs with dynamic routing
6. **Cross-Browser**: Chrome, Firefox, Edge at minimum

## Red Flags That Should Trigger Documentation

If you notice any of these, STOP and document:
- ⚠️ Same error appearing multiple times
- ⚠️ Solution that "just works" without understanding why
- ⚠️ Workaround instead of root cause fix
- ⚠️ Code that feels fragile or timing-dependent
- ⚠️ Different behavior across browsers
- ⚠️ Framework-specific handling needed (React/Vue/Angular)

## Success Metrics

The learning system is working if:
- ✅ Similar issues don't recur after being documented
- ✅ Implementation speed increases over time (reusing patterns)
- ✅ Fewer unexpected errors in new features
- ✅ Clear documentation trail for every decision
- ✅ New team members can understand context from docs

---

**Remember**: Every mistake is a learning opportunity, but ONLY if you:
1. Understand the root cause
2. Document it properly
3. Check docs before future implementations
4. Update patterns as you learn

The goal is not perfection, but continuous improvement through systematic learning.
