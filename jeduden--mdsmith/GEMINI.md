- [How "flavor" (a property of the renderer), "rule" (a single check), "convention" (a project-wide bundle), and "kind" (a per-file role tag) differ in mdsmith, the cases where they overlap, and how the four concepts compose.](../docs/background/concepts/flavor-rule-convention-kind.md)

<?/catalog?>

### Development Workflow

- Any change follows Red/Green TDD: failing test, then pass, then commit
- Keep commits small and focused on one change
- Run `mdsmith check .` before committing; all markdown must pass
- Never modify `.mdsmith.yml` (linter configuration) without explicit user consent — this includes rule settings, overrides, ignore patterns, and file-length limits

### PR Workflow

Use the `/gh-pr-fixup`, `/gh-resolve-threads`, and `/merge-queue`
skills for PR work — they cover rebases, CI monitoring, thread
resolution, and merge enqueuing. After every push, request a
Copilot re-review (the skills do this automatically).

### Plan Maintenance

When implementing work tracked by `plan/`:

- Update the plan file **as part of implementation**, not a follow-up
- Check off tasks and acceptance criteria as they're verified
- Move front-matter `status`: `🔲` → `🔳` on start, `✅` when done
- If implementation deviates, update plan text to match
- Run `mdsmith fix PLAN.md` after editing front matter

### Terminal Demo (`demo.tape`)

`demo.tape` records the demo GIF. Editing notes:

- Backtick-delimited strings for embedded quotes: `` Type `cmd 'status: "✅"'` ``. `\"` inside double-quoted Type strings crashes VHS
- A hidden `set +e` runs at start, so don't append `; true` to commands
- `demo/sample.md` is in the `.mdsmith.yml` ignore list; hidden setup copies it to a temp dir for check/fix
- Keep Sleep durations short (1–2 s) for fast CI renders
- Use only fixable rules in `demo/sample.md` (trailing spaces, long lines, bare URLs) so the fix→check flow works

### Writing Guidelines

When writing descriptions, state what specific data must satisfy
what condition. Name the inputs (front matter fields, glob pattern,
heading level), not just the mechanism. Avoid vague verbs (match,
sync, reflect) without saying what is checked against what.

#### Build & Test Commands

Requires Go 1.25+. Dev tools (golangci-lint and
gobco) build from `tools/go.mod`, which needs Go
1.25.8+; `go.mod` itself stays tool-free so
`go install` consumers never inherit a dev tool's
go floor.

- `go build ./...` — build all packages
- `go test ./...` — run all tests
- `go test -run TestName ./...` — run a specific test
- `go run ./cmd/mdsmith check .` — lint markdown
- `go run ./cmd/mdsmith fix .` — auto-fix markdown
- `go tool -modfile=tools/go.mod golangci-lint run` — run linter
- `go vet ./...` — run go vet

#### Project Layout

Follows the [standard Go project layout][stdlayout]:

- `cmd/mdsmith/` — main entry point.
- `internal/` — private packages.
- `internal/rules/<rule-name>/` — rule code (e.g.
  `paragraphstructure/`).
- `internal/rules/MDS###-<rule-name>/` — rule README
  and good/bad fixtures (e.g.
  `MDS024-paragraph-structure/`).
- `testdata/` — shared markdown fixtures.
- `pkg/goldmark/` — vendored goldmark fork.

[stdlayout]: https://go.dev/doc/modules/layout

#### Code Style

- Follow standard Go conventions (gofmt, goimports).
- Use golangci-lint for linting.
- Keep functions small and focused.
- Error messages: lowercase, no trailing punctuation.
- Prefer returning errors over panicking.

#### Defensive Code

Add a defensive branch only when you can drive it
red/green. Write the failing test first. Then add
the code that takes the branch.

#### Allocation Budget

**A rule's `Check` allocates ≤ 10 times per call on
representative input.** Enforced by
`internal/integration/alloc_budget_test.go`; most
rules allocate 0–6.

- Walk `f.Lines` / `f.AST` directly.
- Prefer `bytes.IndexByte` / `bytes.Contains` over
  `regexp` for fixed searches.
- Compile every `regexp.Regexp` at package scope.
- Pre-size slices with `make([]X, 0, n)`.
- Reuse loop-local buffers via `buf = buf[:0]`.
- Return `nil`, not an empty slice, on no diagnostics.

#### Test Fixtures

Rule test fixtures live in
`internal/rules/MDS###-<rule-name>/` (e.g.
`MDS024-paragraph-structure/`). Each rule has `good/`
and `bad/` examples (or `good.md` / `bad.md`).

Good fixtures must pass **all default-enabled rules**
plus the rule under test. Opt-in rules are skipped:
a good MDS001 fixture need not also satisfy MDS043.
When a good fixture uses non-default settings,
override them in `.mdsmith.yml` so `mdsmith check .`
also passes. Bad fixtures are excluded via the
`ignore:` section.

When adding or changing a rule, add both:

1. **Unit tests** in `rule_test.go` (inline markdown,
   fast red/green). Use `require` for preconditions
   and `assert` for checks; `Same`/`NotSame` for
   pointer identity.
2. **Fixture tests** under
   `internal/rules/MDS###-<rule-name>/` with YAML
   frontmatter specifying expected diagnostics.
   Discovered automatically by
   `internal/integration/rules_test.go`.

#### Config Merge Semantics

Layered config (defaults → kinds → overrides) is
**deep-merged** rule by rule:

- Maps merge key by key; siblings set in earlier
  layers survive partial overrides.
- Scalar leaves are replaced wholesale.
- List settings replace by default. Opt into
  `append` by implementing
  `rule.ListMerger.SettingMergeMode(key)`. The
  placeholder vocabulary is the canonical example.
- A bool-only layer (`rule-name: false`) toggles
  `enabled` without erasing inherited settings.

New list-typed settings must document the choice
next to their `ApplySettings` handler.

#### Generated Sections

Content between `<?directive ... ?>` and
`<?/directive?>` markers is auto-generated. Edit
directive parameters or the source file, then run
`mdsmith fix <file>` — never the body by hand. Run
`mdsmith merge-driver install [files...]` once per
clone so generated-section conflicts resolve
automatically.
