## Documentation

Use `docs/design/overall.md` as the high-level architecture map when you need system context. Do not update internal design docs for routine code changes. Update `docs/design` only when a change materially affects architecture, durable product contracts, data models, APIs, operational procedures, or when the user explicitly asks for a design update.

Update public Fumadocs (`docs/public`) only for significant user-facing behavior, setup, API, or integration changes. Most PRs should not need documentation updates.

## Debugging Production

When investigating bugs or unexpected behavior, three Make targets give read-only access to prod. All require `SSH_KEY` (defaults to `~/.ssh/143-deploy`) and resolve hosts/credentials via sops from `.env.production.enc` in the private secrets checkout (`SECRETS_DIR`, default `../143-infra` — see docs/secrets/README.md).

### Querying the database

- **`make db-query Q='SELECT ...'`** — runs a one-shot SQL query against the prod Postgres as the `readonly` role. SELECT-only, every connection is a read-only txn, bounded by a 30s `statement_timeout`. Use single quotes around `Q` and escape literal `$` as `$$` (Make eats single `$`). For an interactive session, use `make db-psql`.

### Searching logs

Logs are shipped via Vector to a VictoriaLogs instance and visualized in Grafana. Use the CLI for scripted/agent searches and the UI for interactive exploration:

- **`make logs-query Q='<LogsQL>' [LIMIT=100]`** — runs a one-shot LogsQL query against VictoriaLogs and prints NDJSON to stdout. Always include a `_time:` filter — without one VictoriaLogs scans the full 30-day retention. Common fields: `service`, `level`, `org_id`, `agent_run_id`, `request_id`, `trace_id`. Examples:

  ```bash
  make logs-query Q='service:api AND level:error AND _time:[now-1h,now]'
  make logs-query Q='agent_run_id:"run-abc123" AND _time:[now-24h,now]' LIMIT=500
  make logs-query Q='"timeout waiting for sandbox" AND _time:[now-15m,now]' | jq -r '.message'
  ```

  See `docs/design/implemented/47-logging-victorialogs.md` for more examples and the [LogsQL reference](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/).

- **`make logs`** — opens an SSH tunnel to the prod Grafana instance at <http://localhost:9999> for interactive UI-based exploration. Press Ctrl+C to close the tunnel. Prefer `make logs-query` for anything scriptable.

## Backend Architecture (Go)

**Key libraries**: `go-chi/chi` (router), `jackc/pgx` (Postgres driver + connection pooling), `rs/zerolog` (structured logging), `go-playground/validator` (request validation), `golang-migrate/migrate` (schema migrations). See `docs/design/implemented/02-api-server.md` for full dependency list.

**Direct pgx store functions for all DB queries**: One store struct per domain area in `internal/db/` (e.g. `issues.go`, `agent_runs.go`, `jobs.go`). All stores accept a `DBTX` interface (satisfied by both `pgxpool.Pool` and `pgx.Tx`). Use `pgx.CollectRows` + `pgx.RowToStructByName` for list queries. SQL lives as string literals inside Go functions, co-located with scanning and error handling. No ORM, no codegen, no separate `.sql` files.

**Service layer**: Handlers call services, services call the DB layer. Business logic belongs in `internal/services/`, never in HTTP handlers. Services are defined as interfaces for testability (mock with `go.uber.org/mock`).

**LLM prompts live in Go templates**: All LLM system prompts must be stored as `.template` files in `internal/prompts/templates/`, rendered via the `prompts` package (`internal/prompts/prompts.go`). Never inline prompt strings as Go constants or string literals in service code. Add a corresponding exported render function in `prompts.go` for each new template.

**Logging**: Use `zerolog` for all log output. Never use `fmt.Printf` or `log.Println`. Logs are JSON-structured and shipped to Mezmo.

**Error handling**: Never discard errors with `_ =` in Go or empty `.catch()` in TypeScript. If an error cannot be propagated (e.g., best-effort cleanup after the main operation succeeded), log it at `Warn` level with context. In HTTP handlers, use `zerolog.Ctx(r.Context())` to get the request-scoped logger (enriched with org_id, user_id, request_id by the `LogContext` middleware). In services, use `s.logger`. If an error CAN be propagated, return it — prefer bubbling errors to the top of the call stack. Transaction rollback in `defer` is the one exception: `defer func() { _ = tx.Rollback(ctx) }()` is acceptable because rollback after commit is a no-op. Frontend: at minimum log with `console.error`; prefer surfacing errors through TanStack Query error states.

**Multi-tenancy**: Every tenant-scoped table has an `org_id uuid NOT NULL` column. Every query MUST filter by `org_id`. Auth middleware extracts org from the session and sets it in request context. Missing an `org_id` filter is a data isolation bug. FKs are the default; only reviewed hot append-only/event/log/cache/telemetry/runtime tables may omit parent FKs.

Two lints enforce this, both run in CI via `make lint-tenancy`:

- **`cmd/lint-schema`** — scans `migrations/*.up.sql` (down migrations are not scanned by design — they restore prior state). Every `CREATE TABLE` must declare `org_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES organizations(id)` unless exempted. Schema-qualified (`public.foo`) and double-quoted (`"foo"`) table names are recognized and normalized for allowlist/display. Two exemption paths: (1) tables with no org_id at all — add to `allowedNoOrgID` in `cmd/lint-schema/main.go` with a justification, or use `-- lint:no-org-id reason="..."`; (2) reviewed hot tables with `org_id NOT NULL` but intentionally no FK — use `-- lint:allow-hot-table-no-fk reason="..."`. Both `reason="..."` clauses are required.
- **`cmd/lint-stores`** — scans exported methods on `*XxxStore` types under `internal/db/`. The linter only polices receivers whose type declaration it actually finds in the scanned files, so a helper type elsewhere that happens to end in `Store` will not be caught. Each method must either take an `orgID uuid.UUID` parameter (the name must end in `orgid` case-insensitively, e.g. `orgID`/`OrgID`/`org_id`/`srcOrgID`) or receive a `*models.X` carrier whose struct has an `OrgID` field — either declared directly or inherited via an embedded type within the `models` package (the lint pre-scans `internal/models/*.go` and resolves embeddings to a fixed point). Methods that are legitimately cross-org (pre-auth lookups, system cleanup, scheduler scans) opt out with a doc comment on the line above `func`; a bare marker without a `reason="..."` clause is itself a lint violation:

  ```go
  // lint:allow-no-orgid reason="pre-auth login lookup by email"
  func (s *UserStore) GetByEmail(ctx context.Context, email string) (models.User, error) { ... }
  ```

When writing a new store method: add `orgID uuid.UUID` as the first arg after `ctx`, filter every SQL clause by `org_id`, and pass `middleware.OrgIDFromContext(r.Context())` from the handler. Do NOT add `lint:allow-no-orgid` unless the method truly must run across orgs.

When writing migrations, default to DB-backed FKs. Use `lint:allow-hot-table-no-fk` only for reviewed hot-table exceptions where the write path validates parent ownership.

A **git pre-commit hook** (`.githooks/pre-commit`, installed by `./setup.sh` or `make hooks-install`) runs these lints against staged files before every commit so violations surface in seconds instead of after a CI round-trip. Bypass with `git commit --no-verify` only for WIP snapshots; CI enforces the same rules regardless.

**API response format**: Lists return `{data: [...], meta: {next_cursor}}` with cursor-based pagination. Errors return `{error: {code, message, details}}`. All routes under `/api/v1/`.

**Enum response fields use typed strings**: For model fields that represent enums (especially API response fields like provider/status/state/type), define a dedicated typed string in `internal/models` with named constants and a `Validate() error` method. Prefer `IntegrationProvider`/`IntegrationStatus`-style types over raw `string` fields. When writing new enum-like fields, add table-driven validation tests.

**Job queue**: Postgres-backed async work queue using the `jobs` table. Workers claim jobs with `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` — no external queue needed. Jobs have `status`, `attempts`, `max_attempts`, and exponential backoff on failure.

## Frontend Architecture (Next.js / React)

**Key libraries**: `shadcn/ui` (copy-paste components on Radix UI + Tailwind, not an npm dependency), `@tanstack/react-query` (server state), `nuqs` (URL search params state for filters). See `docs/design/03-frontend.md` for full list.

**shadcn/ui first — no raw HTML elements**: Always use shadcn/ui components for all interactive and structural UI. Never use raw HTML elements (`<button>`, `<input>`, `<select>`, `<textarea>`, `<table>`, etc.) when a shadcn/ui component exists. Use `<Button>` not `<button>`, `<Input>` not `<input>`, `<Card>` not `<div className="border ...">`, and so on. This is critical because shadcn components include consistent styling (e.g., `cursor-pointer`, focus rings, disabled states) that raw elements lack, and using the components everywhere makes it easy to update the design system in one place. Install new components with `npx shadcn@latest add <component>`. When styling, use shadcn's semantic design tokens (`text-foreground`, `text-muted-foreground`, `bg-card`, `border-border`, etc.) instead of hardcoded hex colors. This keeps the UI consistent and theme-able.

**Shared components**: Reusable app-level components live in `src/components/`. Current shared components:
- `PageHeader` — consistent page title + description. Use on every page.
- `EmptyState` — centered icon + title + description + optional action. Use for all empty/zero-data states.

**Server state**: All API calls go through TanStack Query hooks (`useQuery`, `useMutation`). No raw fetch. TanStack Query handles caching, deduplication, and background refetching.

**Filter state**: Use `nuqs` to store filter/search state in URL params so views are bookmarkable and shareable.

**Verification**: Prefer focused verification during ordinary implementation. For frontend changes, run targeted Vitest tests for changed components/pages when useful, and lint the touched files when practical. Run full `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, and `npm run build` only for broad changes, routing/build/config changes, public docs/MDX changes, shared type/API contract changes, or pre-PR final verification when explicitly requested.

## Go Toolchain and Verification

Prefer focused Go verification during ordinary implementation. Run tests for the touched package(s) first, and broaden only when the change crosses package boundaries or shared contracts.

Run `go vet` on touched packages when the change affects Go logic, struct tags, format strings, concurrency, atomic operations, command code, or other vet-sensitive areas. Fix every issue `go vet` reports.

Run full `go test ./...`, `go vet ./...`, or `go build ./...` only when the change is broad, crosses shared contracts, touches build/deploy wiring, or before preparing a PR/commit when explicitly requested. `go test` already compiles packages; use `go build ./...` mainly for command/build packaging changes or when no useful test path compiles the affected command.

**Use `go fix`** when upgrading Go versions or updating APIs. `go fix` rewrites source code to use newer API signatures after a Go release deprecates old ones. Run it when:
- Upgrading the Go version in `go.mod` — run `go fix ./...` afterward to migrate deprecated API calls
- After updating a dependency that has changed its API surface

```bash
go fix ./...
```

`go fix` modifies files in place, so review the diff afterward. It is safe to run repeatedly — if nothing needs fixing, it makes no changes.

**Verification examples**:
- Touched one backend package: run `go test ./internal/path/to/package`, plus `go vet ./internal/path/to/package` if vet-relevant.
- Touched related backend packages: run tests for each touched package and any package whose contract changed.
- Touched command, migration tooling, or deploy/build wiring: consider `go test ./...`, `go vet ./...`, or `go build ./...` based on the blast radius.

## Testing Expectations

Behavior changes should include tests. Prefer updating or adding focused tests near the changed code. Strict red-green TDD is encouraged for non-trivial logic, bug fixes, and shared contracts, but it is not required for small constant, copy, fixture, or configuration-default updates. No PR should be opened without appropriate tests for the behavior changed.

### Coverage Requirements (enforced in CI)

- **Backend**: minimum **70%** line coverage — CI will fail PRs below this
- **Frontend**: minimum **80%** line coverage — CI will fail PRs below this
- New behavior without appropriate tests will not be merged
- Coverage is checked by GitHub Actions on every PR via `go test -coverprofile` and `vitest --coverage`

### Backend Test Patterns (Go)

**Libraries**: `go test`, `stretchr/testify` (`require` package — not `assert`), `net/http/httptest`, `pashagolub/pgxmock/v4`, `go.uber.org/mock`.

**Table-driven tests are the default.** Every test with more than one case MUST use a slice of test cases (often called `tests` or `tt`). This keeps tests readable, makes it trivial to add new cases, and works naturally with `t.Parallel()`.

**Use `require`, not `assert`.** Always use `require.Equal`, `require.NoError`, etc. from `github.com/stretchr/testify/require`. The `require` package fails the test immediately on failure, which prevents cascading nil-pointer panics and confusing output. Never use the `assert` package.

**Always compare exact expected values.** Put the full expected value in the test case struct (e.g., `expected []models.Issue`) and compare with `require.Equal(t, tt.expected, actual, "message")`. Avoid partial checks like `require.Len` when you can compare the whole value — this catches field-level regressions, not just counts.

**Always include a message.** Every `require.*` call MUST have a descriptive message string as the last argument. The message should describe what behavior is being verified, not just restate the assertion. Good: `"should return both issues for org"`. Bad: `"length should be 2"`.

**Use `t.Parallel()` everywhere.** Call `t.Parallel()` at the top of every `Test*` function AND inside every `t.Run` subtest. To make this possible:
- Design test functions as pure input/output — pass all dependencies as arguments, never rely on package-level mutable state.
- Each test case must construct its own fixtures (mocks, request objects, expected results) inside the subtest. No shared mutable state across cases.
- If a test truly cannot run in parallel (e.g., it touches a shared external resource with no isolation), document why with a comment.

**Fixture pattern**: Define fixture helpers that return fresh, isolated test data. Prefer factory functions (e.g., `newTestIssue(overrides)`) over global `var` fixtures. This ensures each parallel subtest gets its own copy.

```go
func TestIssueStore_ListByOrg(t *testing.T) {
    t.Parallel()

    tests := []struct {
        name      string
        orgID     string
        setupMock func(mock pgxmock.PgxPoolIface)
        expected  []models.Issue
        expectErr bool
    }{
        {
            name:  "returns issues for org",
            orgID: "org-1",
            setupMock: func(mock pgxmock.PgxPoolIface) {
                mock.ExpectQuery("SELECT .* FROM issues WHERE org_id").
                    WithArgs(pgxmock.AnyArg()).
                    WillReturnRows(pgxmock.NewRows([]string{"id", "org_id"}).
                        AddRow("issue-1", "org-1").
                        AddRow("issue-2", "org-1"))
            },
            expected: []models.Issue{
                {ID: "issue-1", OrgID: "org-1"},
                {ID: "issue-2", OrgID: "org-1"},
            },
        },
        {
            name:  "returns empty for org with no issues",
            orgID: "org-empty",
            setupMock: func(mock pgxmock.PgxPoolIface) {
                mock.ExpectQuery("SELECT .* FROM issues WHERE org_id").
                    WithArgs(pgxmock.AnyArg()).
                    WillReturnRows(pgxmock.NewRows([]string{"id", "org_id"}))
            },
            expected: []models.Issue{},
        },
        {
            name:  "returns error on db failure",
            orgID: "org-1",
            setupMock: func(mock pgxmock.PgxPoolIface) {
                mock.ExpectQuery("SELECT .* FROM issues WHERE org_id").
                    WithArgs(pgxmock.AnyArg()).
                    WillReturnError(fmt.Errorf("connection refused"))
            },
            expectErr: true,
        },
    }

    for _, tt := range tests {
        t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {
            t.Parallel()

            mock, _ := pgxmock.NewPool()
            defer mock.Close()
            store := db.NewIssueStore(mock)
            tt.setupMock(mock)

            issues, err := store.ListByOrg(ctx, tt.orgID, db.IssueFilters{})
            if tt.expectErr {
                require.Error(t, err, "ListByOrg should return an error")
                return
            }
            require.NoError(t, err, "ListByOrg should not return an error")
            require.Equal(t, tt.expected, issues, "ListByOrg should return the expected issues")
            require.NoError(t, mock.ExpectationsWereMet(), "all database expectations should be met")
        })
    }
}
```

**Handler tests** (`internal/api/handlers/*_test.go`): Use `httptest.NewRecorder()` + `chi.NewRouteContext()`. Mock the store, call the handler directly, assert status code and response body. Same table-driven + `t.Parallel()` pattern applies.

```go
func TestIssueHandler_List(t *testing.T) {
    t.Parallel()

    tests := []struct {
        name         string
        setupStore   func(ctrl *gomock.Controller) *mocks.MockIssueStore
        expectedCode int
        expectedBody models.ListResponse[models.Issue]
    }{
        {
            name: "returns issues successfully",
            setupStore: func(ctrl *gomock.Controller) *mocks.MockIssueStore {
                s := mocks.NewMockIssueStore(ctrl)
                s.EXPECT().ListByOrg(gomock.Any(), gomock.Any(), gomock.Any()).
                    Return([]models.Issue{
                        {ID: "issue-1", OrgID: "org-1"},
                        {ID: "issue-2", OrgID: "org-1"},
                    }, nil)
                return s
            },
            expectedCode: http.StatusOK,
            expectedBody: models.ListResponse[models.Issue]{
                Data: []models.Issue{
                    {ID: "issue-1", OrgID: "org-1"},
                    {ID: "issue-2", OrgID: "org-1"},
                },
            },
        },
    }

    for _, tt := range tests {
        t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {
            t.Parallel()

            ctrl := gomock.NewController(t)
            store := tt.setupStore(ctrl)
            handler := handlers.NewIssueHandler(store)

            rr := httptest.NewRecorder()
            handler.List(rr, req)
            require.Equal(t, tt.expectedCode, rr.Code, "handler should return expected status code")

            var resp models.ListResponse[models.Issue]
            require.NoError(t, json.Unmarshal(rr.Body.Bytes(), &resp), "response body should be valid JSON")
            require.Equal(t, tt.expectedBody, resp, "handler should return the expected response body")
        })
    }
}
```

**Middleware tests** (`internal/api/middleware/*_test.go`): Test that middleware correctly blocks/allows requests and sets context values.

**Multi-tenancy invariant**: Every store method that queries a table with `org_id` MUST have a test verifying the `org_id` filter is applied. The multi-tenancy audit test (`internal/db/tenancy_test.go`) scans all SQL for org_id presence.

### Frontend Test Patterns (React)

**Libraries**: `vitest`, `@testing-library/react`, `@testing-library/user-event`, `@testing-library/jest-dom`, `msw`.

**Component tests** (`src/**/*.test.tsx`): Render the component, assert on visible content, simulate user interactions.

```tsx
it('renders issues in the data table', async () => {
  server.use(http.get('/api/v1/issues', () => HttpResponse.json({ data: mockIssues, meta: {} })));
  render(<IssuesPage />);
  expect(await screen.findByText('TypeError: Cannot read properties')).toBeInTheDocument();
  expect(screen.getByText('critical')).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

**API client tests** (`src/lib/__tests__/api.test.ts`): Test error handling, parameter construction, response parsing.

**MSW for API mocking**: Use `msw` (Mock Service Worker) to intercept network requests in tests. Define handlers in `src/test/mocks/handlers.ts`. The server is a per-worker singleton (`src/test/mocks/server.ts`); never call `server.listen()`/`server.close()` from individual test files — use `server.use()` for per-test overrides (reset automatically after each test).

**Worker reuse (`isolate: false`)**: vitest reuses one worker — one module graph and one jsdom window — across many test files (`vitest.config.ts`). `src/test/setup.ts` keeps files independent: it calls `vi.resetModules()` after each file so `vi.mock` factories and module-level state cannot leak across files, and restores pristine descriptors for commonly-overridden globals (`window.matchMedia`, `window.location`, `window.ResizeObserver`, `navigator.clipboard`, `navigator.vibrate`) plus `document.title`, stubbed globals, and fake timers. If a test overrides some other shared global, add it to the pristine list in setup.ts or restore it in the test file's own `afterAll`. The node project gets the same per-file `vi.resetModules()` via `src/test/setup-node.ts`.

## Integration Tools (Sentry, Linear, Notion, Slack)

**Use `143-tools` CLI for sandbox agents, not the MCP server.** Both binaries share the same `ToolRegistry` (`internal/services/mcp/tools.go`), so tool coverage is identical. The CLI is preferred because it costs ~200-800 tokens (vs much heavier MCP protocol framing), LLMs already know how to use CLIs from training data, and there's no subprocess lifecycle to manage.

The orchestrator handles CLI injection automatically: `buildIntegrationSkills()` generates a markdown skills doc, `resolveAgentEnv()` passes credentials as env vars. Adding a new tool to `tools.go` makes it available in both CLI and MCP with no extra work.

**When to use MCP (`143-mcp`)**: IDE integrations that speak MCP protocol, external JSON-RPC clients, interactive development tools. Never for sandbox agents.

See `internal/services/mcp/AGENTS.md` for detailed implementation guidance.

## Security Patterns

**RBAC**: The `middleware.RequireRole(roles ...string)` middleware enforces role-based access. Apply it in the router after `Auth` middleware. Three roles: `admin` (full access), `member` (read + write), `viewer` (read-only). Webhook and health endpoints are exempt.

**Rate limiting**: `middleware.RateLimit(opts)` applies per-org and per-IP token bucket limits. Default: 100 req/s per org, 20 req/s per IP. Returns 429 with `Retry-After` header.

**Webhook signatures**: All inbound webhooks MUST verify HMAC-SHA256 signatures. The webhook secret is stored in `integrations.config.webhook_secret`. Invalid signatures return 401 immediately.

**Input validation**: Request body size capped at 1MB (`middleware.MaxBodySize`). All handler input structs should validate required fields and acceptable values before processing.

**Multi-tenancy**: Every DB query MUST filter by `org_id`. Missing an `org_id` filter is a P0 data isolation bug. The automated tenancy test catches this.

## Insert-Only Versioned Settings Pattern

For settings/config tables that need change history, use insert-only versioning instead of `updated_at`.

**How it works**: To update, deactivate the current row (`active = false`), then insert a new active row with merged values. To delete, deactivate the current row and insert a new inactive row. All historical versions are preserved.

**Schema requirements**:
- `active boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT true`
- `created_at` timestamp (no `updated_at`)
- Unique constraints must be partial indexes filtered on `WHERE active = true`

**Model requirements**: Use `models.Optional[T]` in update request types so unset fields can be distinguished from explicit values. Use `Optional.GetValueWithDefault(existing)` / `Optional.GetPtrWithDefault(existing)` when merging.

**Implementation pattern**:
1. `Update...Settings` (exported): wraps in a **transaction** (`db.TxStarter.Begin()`), orchestrates inactivate + insert.
2. `inactivate...Settings` (unexported): `UPDATE SET active = false ... RETURNING <columns>` via the transaction to get previous values.
3. `insert...Settings` (unexported): merge optionals with returned values, insert new active row within the same transaction.

**Always use a transaction.** The inactivate + insert must be atomic. If the process crashes between the UPDATE and INSERT without a transaction, the old row is deactivated with no replacement, leaving the data in an inconsistent state. Use `db.TxStarter` (which extends `DBTX` with `Begin()`) for stores that need insert-only versioning. Pattern:
```go
tx, err := s.db.Begin(ctx)
if err != nil { return err }
defer tx.Rollback(ctx)
// ... UPDATE SET active = false using tx ...
// ... INSERT new active row using tx ...
return tx.Commit(ctx)
```

### When to use

Use for **settings/config tables** where change history is valuable and the table has no inbound foreign keys from child tables (or FKs reference a logical identity key, not the PK).

Do **NOT** use for operational/lifecycle entities, external entity mirrors, computed/cached data, running counters, version history tables, or tables that are FK targets for child tables.

### Tables using this pattern

| Table | Logical identity |
|-------|-----------------|
| `review_patterns` | (org_id, repo, rule) |
| `prompt_overrides` | (org_id, template_id, scope_type, repository_id, issue_type, phase) |
| `eval_release_gates` | (org_id, gate_name) |
| `tuning_config_versions` | (org_id, config_scope, scope_key) |

## Database Triggers

The `trg_project_task_counts_update` trigger (migration 000047) fires on ALL column updates to `project_tasks`, not just status changes. This is because PostgreSQL does not allow `REFERENCING` transition tables with column-list triggers (`AFTER UPDATE OF status`). The recount logic is idempotent so correctness is unaffected, but be aware that updating non-status columns (e.g. `branch_name`, `pr_url`) will also trigger a recount of `total_tasks`, `completed_tasks`, and `failed_tasks` on the parent project.

## Production Secrets Guardrail

Encrypted env bundles (`.env*.enc`) and `.sops.yaml` live in the private secrets repo (`SECRETS_DIR` — defaults to a `143-infra` checkout next to the main repo, resolved worktree-safely via the shared git dir), never in this public repo — the pre-commit hook and `.gitignore` both block them here. Treat `.env.production.enc` in that checkout as protected production configuration: do not edit, regenerate, or commit changes to it unless the user explicitly asks for a production secret/config change. Read-only decrypts through the Make targets above are fine. Before finishing any work that involved prod debugging, check `git -C "$(./deploy/scripts/resolve-secrets-dir.sh .)" status --short` and leave it clean unless the requested task was specifically to update production env.
