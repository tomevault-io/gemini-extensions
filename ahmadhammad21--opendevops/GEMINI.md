# CLAUDE.md — OpenDevOps Agent

## Project Overview

OpenDevOps Agent is an open-source AWS incident investigation tool powered by any LLM via LiteLLM. It runs a LangGraph ReAct loop (via DeepAgents) that calls 27 tools — 21 structured boto3 AWS tools plus bash, history analytics, skills, and a structured final-answer tool — then streams results to a React/Vite chat UI over SSE. Auth, multi-user RBAC, event-driven incident detection (EventBridge → SQS), and proactive anomaly polling are all built in and optional.

## Repo Structure

```
apps/
  core/           Installable package `opendevops-core` — the shared agent brain:
                  src/opendevops_core/{agent, tools, providers, models, skills,
                  integrations, migrations, config.py}. Has no web/CLI layer.
                  Consumed by the OSS backend (and, later, the SaaS product repo).
  backend/        OSS web app + CLI — src/{api, cli, config, mcp_server.py}, tests/,
                  scripts/, pyproject.toml. Depends on opendevops-core via a uv path source.
  frontend/       React/Vite UI — src/, package.json, vite.config.ts
  documentation/  Markdown docs (future hosted docs site)
deployment/
  docker-compose/ docker-compose.yml (PostgreSQL + backend + frontend)
  railway/        Dockerfile.railway + railway.toml (combined single-image deploy)
design-system/   Cross-cutting design reference (colors, typography, UI kits)
demos/           Reproducible AWS incident scripts for local testing
Makefile         Root convenience targets — wraps `cd apps/backend && uv run ...`
```

All Python commands run from `apps/backend/` (or via `make <target>` at repo root).
`uv sync` from `apps/backend/` installs `opendevops-core` editable from `../core`, so edits
to core are live without republishing.

### Core vs app boundary
- **Reusable agent logic lives in `apps/core` (`opendevops_core`)** — the DeepAgents loop,
  tools, providers, models, skills, integrations, DB backends, and baseline migrations.
- **Web/CLI-only code stays in `apps/backend`** — FastAPI routers, auth, the CLI, `mcp_server.py`.
- **Config injection:** core reads settings through the `settings` proxy in
  `opendevops_core/config.py`, which delegates to whatever instance the host app registers via
  `configure()`. The OSS app's `Settings(CoreSettings)` (in `apps/backend/src/config/appsettings.py`)
  adds web/auth-only fields (e.g. `jwt_*`) and calls `configure(settings)` at startup.

---

## Automatic Behavior Rules

**Always do these when making changes:**

- **New env var:** if core reads it, add the Pydantic field to `CoreSettings` in `apps/core/src/opendevops_core/config.py`; if it's web/auth-only, add it to `Settings(CoreSettings)` in `apps/backend/src/config/appsettings.py`. Either way mirror it in `.env.example` (with a comment). Never read env vars directly — always go through `settings`.
- **New DB column or table:** add a new numbered migration. Core-domain schema (tables core code reads/writes) goes in `apps/core/src/opendevops_core/migrations/` (e.g. `014_name.sql`); OSS-app-only schema goes in `apps/backend/migrations/`. The runner applies core-then-app, tracked in the `schema_migrations(source, version)` ledger. Never add columns inline in Python code.
- **New tool:** add it to `ALL_TOOLS` in `apps/core/src/opendevops_core/agent/core.py`. Tool functions must be plain synchronous Python functions — DeepAgents infers the JSON schema from type hints and docstrings.
- **New API route that matches a React Router path:** prefix it with `/api/` to avoid the SPA fallback conflict. The `/{full_path:path}` catch-all in `apps/backend/src/api/app.py` intercepts any GET that matches a registered FastAPI route first.
- **New skill:** drop a `SKILL.md` file into `apps/core/src/opendevops_core/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`. It is picked up automatically at startup (and bundled into the core wheel) — no code changes needed. Use the frontmatter format (`name`, `description`) from the existing `lambda-throttling` skill.
- **Docs sync:** if a feature has a corresponding file in `apps/documentation/`, update it when the feature changes. The `apps/documentation/` folder is the public documentation source.

## Current State

Everything below is built and working in the codebase:

### Agent & Tools
- **Framework:** DeepAgents (`create_deep_agent`) wrapping a LangGraph ReAct loop. `ChatLiteLLM` as the model interface — supports OpenRouter, Anthropic, OpenAI, Groq, Ollama, and any OpenAI-compatible endpoint via a single `LLM_MODEL` env var.
- **27 tools total** registered in `ALL_TOOLS` in `apps/core/src/opendevops_core/agent/core.py`:
  - CloudWatch (6): `get_alarms`, `get_alarm_history`, `get_metric_data`, `get_log_events`, `describe_log_groups`, `query_logs_insights`
  - CloudTrail (2): trail events + event lookup
  - ECS (4): clusters, services, service detail, tasks
  - Lambda (4): list, config, error rate, concurrent executions
  - EC2 (2): list instances, instance details
  - RDS (2): list DBs, DB details
  - IAM (1): describe role + policies
  - Bash (1): `run_bash_command` — allowlisted read-only `aws`, `kubectl`, `docker` commands; never `shell=True`; 30s hard timeout
  - History (2): `get_investigation_history`, `search_past_investigations`
  - Skills (2): `list_skills`, `use_skill`
  - Final answer (1): `submit_investigation` — structured output required to end every investigation
- **Tool response capping:** `with_cap()` wraps every tool at startup when `TOOL_RESPONSE_MAX_CHARS > 0`; truncates oversized responses and appends a notice to the LLM.
- **Tool caching:** `@tool_cached` — in-process TTL LRU cache (2-min TTL, 256 entries max); cache key includes function name + AWS profile + region.
- **Skills system:** several skills ship (e.g. `lambda-throttling`). The system prompt is built at import time by scanning `apps/core/src/opendevops_core/skills/*/SKILL.md` — skill names are injected; full content is loaded lazily when the agent calls `use_skill(name)`.
- **Summarization:** `maybe_summarize()` runs before each agent call; compacts old messages when total chars exceed `SUMMARIZATION_THRESHOLD_CHARS`; tracks the event in `usage_events` with `metadata.summarization=True`.
- **Cancellation:** `DELETE /chat/{session_id}` sets an `asyncio.Event` that stops the streaming loop at the next chunk boundary.

### Storage
- Three backends all implementing `DatabaseBackend` ABC: `memory` (default, zero config), `sqlite` (aiosqlite + LangGraph SQLite checkpointer), `postgres` (psycopg3 async + `AsyncPostgresSaver`).
- LangGraph checkpointer tables are created automatically by `AsyncPostgresSaver.setup()`. Application tables come from the bundled core migrations in `apps/core/src/opendevops_core/migrations/*.sql`.
- Schema tables: `organizations`, `users`, `aws_profiles`, `sessions`, `messages`, `tool_calls`, `usage_events`, `findings`, `api_keys`, `alerts`.
- Soft delete is in place on sessions (`is_deleted`, `deleted_at` from migration 002).
- Multi-tenant scoping: `upsert_session`, `list_sessions`, and `get_messages` accept an optional `org_id` (default `None` = unscoped). Postgres enforces it (filters lists, denies cross-org `get_messages`); memory scopes it; sqlite accepts-but-ignores it (single-tenant). `None` preserves single-tenant OSS behavior — the scoping exists for downstream multi-tenant consumers (the SaaS product).

### API
- FastAPI SSE endpoint at `POST /chat`; streams `token`, `tool_status`, `tool_call`, `error`, `done`, `cancelled` events.
- SPA fallback: `GET /{full_path:path}` first serves a matching root-level file from `apps/frontend/dist/` (favicon, logos, and any other `public/` asset Vite copies to the build root), and otherwise returns `index.html` so React Router works on refresh. Vite's hashed JS/CSS is served separately via the `/assets` mount. **Don't narrow this back to "always index.html"** — root-level `public/` assets (e.g. `/favicon.svg`, `/Emblem.svg`) would then be served as HTML and render as broken images.
- All routes that could conflict with React Router paths use the `/api/` prefix: `/api/settings`, `/api/users`, `/api/history`, `/api/monitoring`, `/api/init`.
- Auth: optional JWT (HS256 via python-jose + bcrypt). Disabled when `JWT_SECRET` is unset — `get_current_user()` returns `None` in that case, meaning all routes are public.

### Event-Driven Detection
- `event_consumer_loop()` long-polls SQS (20s wait), processes EventBridge events (CloudWatch alarm, ECS task failure, Lambda async error, RDS event, EC2 state change, CodePipeline failure, AWS Health), runs a full agent investigation per event, delivers results to SNS + Slack, persists to `alerts` table.
- `context_collectors.collect_context()` pre-fetches resource facts deterministically before the LLM runs to reduce tool call count.
- Starts automatically on app startup if `event_consumer_enabled=True`, `sqs_queue_url` is set, or database-backed app config marks event infrastructure as enabled. Autonomous monitoring requires SQLite or PostgreSQL; memory mode is disabled for poller/consumer runs.

### Proactive Polling
- `polling_loop()` runs every `POLL_INTERVAL_SECONDS` seconds (disabled by default at 0); checks CloudWatch alarms in ALARM state and Lambda error rates above `POLL_ERROR_THRESHOLD`; auto-investigates new anomalies and posts to Slack/Telegram. Dedup uses canonical incident keys and durable DB-backed claims.

### Frontend
- React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS + `@tailwindcss/typography`
- Font: Inter Variable (Google Fonts) with a full system fallback stack
- Routes: `/`, `/chat/:sessionId`, `/dashboard`, `/monitoring`, `/monitoring/:alertId`, `/history`, `/settings`, `/users`, `/login`
- Chat page: SSE streaming, tool call inspector, cost/latency card, stop button, suggestion chips on empty state, `?prompt=` deeplink support
- Sidebar: paginated session list (15 at a time), three-dot menu with rename + delete (portal-based, no overflow clipping), real `<a>` links for native right-click
- Settings: Environment, Agent Config, Integrations (UI stubs), AWS Configuration (editable, admin only), Preferences (dark mode)

### Auth & MCP
- RBAC: `admin` and `user` roles. First registered user auto-becomes admin. `JWT_SECRET` unset = auth disabled.
- MCP server via fastmcp: `investigate`, `ask`, `list_sessions` tools. Stdio and HTTP+SSE transports.

---

## Current Priorities

Incomplete items from the README roadmap (do not mark complete here — update README when done):

- **Custom tools via URL** — register external tools by OpenAPI endpoint; agent discovers them alongside built-in tools
- **Bash sandbox Phase 2** — throwaway Docker container per command: `--network none`, read-only FS, non-root, `--memory 256m`, killed immediately after; current Phase 1 (subprocess allowlist) is in `apps/core/src/opendevops_core/tools/bash_tool.py`
- **Optimize tool loading** — pass only contextually relevant tools instead of the full 27-tool set per invocation
- **OpenTelemetry traces** — spans for agent steps, tool call latency, token usage; OTLP export
- **Follow-up question suggestions** — add `follow_up_questions: list[str]` to `submit_investigation` schema (same call, no extra LLM cost); surface as chips in the chat UI after investigation completes
- **Session / user feedback loop** — thumbs up/down on investigations; `feedback` column in `usage_events` (needs migration 006)
- **Slack Integration UI** — Slack backend is fully implemented (`apps/core/src/opendevops_core/integrations/slack_webhook.py`); Settings → Integrations "Connect" button is currently a non-functional stub
- **Session rename** — `PATCH /sessions/{id}` + inline edit in sidebar three-dot menu
- **Multi-account AWS** — `aws_profiles` table already in schema; needs Settings UI + per-session profile selector
- **Knowledge base** — attach runbooks, post-mortems, architecture docs beyond the skills system

## What NOT to Change Without Discussion

| Contract | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| **SSE event types:** `token`, `tool_status`, `tool_call`, `error`, `done`, `cancelled` | Frontend `ChatPage.tsx` switches on these exact strings. Renaming or adding new required fields is a breaking change. |
| **Tool function signatures** | DeepAgents infers JSON schema from Python type hints + docstrings. Adding `*args`, `**kwargs`, removing type hints, or making parameters non-primitive breaks schema inference silently. |
| **`DatabaseBackend` ABC** (`apps/core/src/opendevops_core/agent/db/base.py`) | All three backends must implement the same interface. Adding a method requires implementing it in all three backends plus `memory.py` defaults. |
| **LangGraph checkpointer wiring** | The checkpointer is passed into `create_deep_agent()` and drives session continuity via `thread_id = session_id`. Do not write messages to the DB outside `save_*` calls or bypass the checkpointer. |
| **Agent framework (DeepAgents + LangGraph)** | The ReAct loop, tool dispatch, checkpointing, and `recursion_limit` contract all depend on this. Do not swap. |
| **DB schema migrations** | Tables have a defined shape. New columns need a new file in `migrations/`. Never add columns inline in Python or modify existing migration files. |
| **Auth opt-out pattern** | `get_current_user()` returns `None` when `jwt_secret` is unset (dev/memory mode). New routes that call `Depends(get_current_user)` must handle `None` gracefully — do not hard-require auth in non-admin routes. |
| **psycopg3 placeholder syntax** | psycopg3 uses `%s` (not `$1`/`$2`). Using asyncpg-style params causes silent failures with no Python exception. |

## Environment Variables

Agent/core variables are defined on `CoreSettings` in `apps/core/src/opendevops_core/config.py`; web/auth-only variables (e.g. `JWT_SECRET`) live on `Settings(CoreSettings)` in `apps/backend/src/config/appsettings.py`. `.env.example` mirrors every variable. The OSS app instantiates `Settings` and registers it via `configure()` so core sees it at runtime.

```bash
# LLM — LiteLLM model string format

LLM_API_BASE=                          # optional custom base URL

## Core Architecture

### Request flow (web chat)
```
POST /chat  →  maybe_summarize()  →  agent.astream()
  LangGraph ReAct loop:
    LLM reasons  →  picks tool  →  @tool_cached check  →  with_cap()  →  boto3 / subprocess
    result injected back to LLM  →  repeat until submit_investigation() or MAX_TOOL_CALLS
  SSE events streamed per chunk:
    token  |  tool_status  |  tool_call  |  error  |  done  |  cancelled
  After stream ends:
    save_turn()  →  upsert_session + save_message + save_tool_calls + save_usage_event
    notify_slack()  →  only if submit_investigation was called
```

### Event-driven flow
```
EventBridge rules (9 event types)
  →  SQS queue  →  event_consumer_loop() (long-poll, 20s wait)
    →  _is_real_failure() filter
    →  collect_context() (deterministic boto3 pre-fetch, no LLM)
    →  agent.ainvoke() (full ReAct loop)
    →  _deliver(): SNS publish + Slack post + add_alert() → alerts table
```

### Startup sequence
```
db.init()  →  init_agent(checkpointer)
  optional: asyncio.create_task(polling_loop())       if POLL_INTERVAL_SECONDS > 0
  optional: asyncio.create_task(event_consumer_loop()) if SQS configured or app config enables infra
```

### Session continuity
The LangGraph checkpointer stores full thread state keyed by `session_id`. Every `/chat` call resumes the thread by passing `thread_id = session_id` in config — the agent sees complete history without the API explicitly passing messages.

## Code Style Rules

- **Type hints everywhere** — no untyped functions, no `Any` without import
- **Tool functions are synchronous** — boto3 is sync; `async` lives only in the API and DB layers
- **Tools always return `dict`, never raise** — catch `BotoCoreError`, `ClientError`, and `Exception`; return `{"error": str(e), ...}` with safe empty defaults
- **Never use `shell=True`** in subprocess — `bash_tool.py` uses `shlex.split()` + list-form `subprocess.run()`
- **Credentials via env or AWS profiles only** — never hardcoded, never in source
- **`logger` (Loguru) for all output** — never `print()`
- **`uv run` / `uv add`** — never bare `pip install`
- **ruff** for lint and format — `line-length = 100`, `target-version = "py311"`, rules `E F I UP`
- **psycopg3 uses `%s` placeholders** — not `$1`/`$2` (that is asyncpg)
- **Route prefix rule** — any API route whose path matches a React Router path must use `/api/` prefix to avoid the SPA fallback catch-all intercepting browser GETs on refresh
- **Migrations are append-only** — never modify existing `.sql` files; add a new numbered file
- **No `shell=True`, no write commands in bash tool** — the allowlist is the contract; never bypass it

Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes. Merge with project-specific instructions as needed.

**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

## 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

## 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

## 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:
```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

---

**These guidelines are working if:** fewer unnecessary changes in diffs, fewer rewrites due to overcomplication, and clarifying questions come before implementation rather than after mistakes.
