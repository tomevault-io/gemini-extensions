# Clicky Windows — Agent Context

## What this project is

A Windows port of [clicky](https://github.com/farzaa/clicky) by @farzaa. The original is a macOS menubar app — an AI companion that lives near your cursor, sees your screen, and responds via voice. This repo is a faithful Windows reimplementation using WPF/.NET 8, keeping the same push-to-talk UX and pipeline.

**This repo is the code-only, developer-friendly version.** It uses a Cloudflare Worker proxy to avoid embedding API keys in the binary. There is a separate GUI/app repo (`clicky-windows-app`) that removes the proxy and adds a first-run setup screen for end users.

## Architecture

### Full pipeline (one interaction cycle)

```
User holds Ctrl+Alt
  → GlobalHotkeyMonitor fires HotkeyPressed
  → AudioCaptureService starts capturing mic (PCM 16kHz mono)
  → AssemblyAiTranscriptionService opens WebSocket, streams audio chunks
User releases Ctrl+Alt
  → AssemblyAI sends Terminate, waits for final transcript
  → ScreenCaptureUtility captures all monitors as JPEG
  → ClaudeApiClient sends screenshots + transcript to Claude (SSE streaming)
  → Claude response is parsed for [POINT:x,y:description:screenName] tags
  → OverlayWindow animates the cursor buddy to the pointed coordinates
  → ElevenLabsTtsClient POSTs text to TTS, plays MP3 via NAudio
```

### Key files

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `clicky-windows/CompanionManager.cs` | Central state machine. Owns the full pipeline. Exposes `VoiceState`, `StreamingResponseText`, `LastTranscript` via `INotifyPropertyChanged`. |
| `clicky-windows/OverlayWindow.xaml.cs` | Full-screen transparent click-through overlay. Hosts animated cursor buddy, response bubble, waveform. |
| `clicky-windows/TrayManager.cs` | System tray icon + context menu (toggle cursor, model picker, quit). |
| `clicky-windows/CompanionPanelWindow.xaml.cs` | Side panel showing state/transcript (not always visible). |
| `clicky-windows/App.xaml.cs` | Entry point. Instantiates CompanionManager, OverlayWindow, TrayManager. |
| `clicky-windows/Services/ClaudeApiClient.cs` | Sends vision requests to Claude via Cloudflare Worker proxy (`/chat`). Streams SSE response. |
| `clicky-windows/Services/AssemblyAiTranscriptionService.cs` | WebSocket client for AssemblyAI v3 real-time streaming. Fetches short-lived token via Worker (`/transcribe-token`). |
| `clicky-windows/Services/ElevenLabsTtsClient.cs` | POSTs text to ElevenLabs via Worker (`/tts`), plays MP3 with NAudio. |
| `clicky-windows/Services/AudioCaptureService.cs` | Captures microphone as PCM 16kHz mono chunks using NAudio. |
| `clicky-windows/Services/ScreenCaptureUtility.cs` | Captures all monitors, returns JPEG bytes + labels (e.g. "Screen 1 (Primary)"). |
| `clicky-windows/Services/GlobalHotkeyMonitor.cs` | Low-level keyboard hook for Ctrl+Alt push-to-talk. |
| `clicky-windows/app.manifest` | Sets UAC level to `requireAdministrator` so the overlay can capture elevated windows (Task Manager etc). |
| `worker/` | Cloudflare Worker source that proxies requests to Anthropic, AssemblyAI, and ElevenLabs. |

## Key design decisions and gotchas

### Cloudflare Worker proxy
All three API keys live in the Worker's environment variables, not in the app binary. The app only knows `WorkerBaseUrl` (set in `CompanionManager.WorkerBaseUrl`). This is the code-repo design — the app repo (`clicky-windows-app`) removes the proxy and calls APIs directly.

### POINT tag regex
Claude outputs pointing coordinates in tags like:
```
[POINT:247:19:Screen 1 (Primary)]
[POINT:247,19:cursor description:Screen 1 (Primary)]
```
The regex must handle both `:` and `,` as the x/y separator, and the description field is optional:
```csharp
@"\[POINT:(\d+(?:\.\d+)?)[:,](\d+(?:\.\d+)?):(?:([^:\]]+):)?([^\]]+)\]"
// Group 1: x, Group 2: y, Group 3: optional description, Group 4: screen name
```
Do not simplify this regex — Claude's output format varies.

### WPF animation hold problem
After a `BeginAnimation` call, WPF holds the property value and silently ignores direct `Canvas.SetLeft`/`Canvas.SetTop` calls. To resume manual positioning after the fly animation, you MUST call:
```csharp
CursorCanvas.BeginAnimation(Canvas.LeftProperty, null);
CursorCanvas.BeginAnimation(Canvas.TopProperty, null);
```
This is done in `OverlayWindow.cs` inside the `settleTimer.Tick` handler after the pointing animation completes.

### Cursor follow after POINT
After pointing, the cursor buddy should stay at the pointed location until the user moves their actual cursor more than 4 pixels. The pattern:
1. After fly animation settles, capture `GetCursorPos` into `_cursorPosAtPointEnd`
2. In `OnCursorFollowTick`, if `_cursorPosAtPointEnd` is set and cursor hasn't moved 4+ pixels → return early (don't follow)
3. Once cursor moves, clear `_cursorPosAtPointEnd` and resume normal follow

### DPI awareness
`GetCursorPos` returns physical pixels. Convert to WPF logical units using:
```csharp
var transform = PresentationSource.FromVisual(this)?.CompositionTarget?.TransformFromDevice ?? Matrix.Identity;
var logical = transform.Transform(new Point(physicalX, physicalY));
```
This matters on high-DPI displays.

### AssemblyAI v3 WebSocket
- Use `wss://streaming.assemblyai.com/v3/ws`
- Pass the API key directly as `?token=` in the URL (no separate auth header needed)
- Model: `u3-rt-pro`, encoding: `pcm_s16le`, sample_rate: 16000
- End-of-turn detection: set `end_of_turn_confidence_threshold=0.3`
- To close: send `{"type":"Terminate"}` and await the receive loop to complete
- This repo fetches a short-lived token via the Worker proxy instead of using the key directly

### Claude API (via Worker)
- Worker proxies to `https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages`
- Required headers: `x-api-key`, `anthropic-version: 2023-06-01`
- Request includes `stream: true`; response is SSE
- Parse SSE events for `type: content_block_delta` + `delta.type: text_delta` to extract text chunks
- Images are sent as base64 JPEG in `content` blocks
- Conversation history is maintained in `CompanionManager._conversationHistory` (max 10 turns)

### ElevenLabs TTS
- Model: `eleven_flash_v2_5` (low latency)
- Speed: `1.2` (max allowed on paid plan; `1.3` causes 400 error)
- Voice ID is set in the Worker environment; the app just POSTs text
- Audio is returned as MP3, played via NAudio `WaveOutEvent + Mp3FileReader`

### Admin elevation
`app.manifest` sets `requireAdministrator`. This means:
- The app must be launched from an elevated terminal or via "Run as administrator"
- Without elevation it still runs, but the overlay cannot capture screenshots of elevated windows (Task Manager, etc.)
- The manifest approach means UAC prompt appears on every launch

## How to run (dev)

1. Deploy the Worker in `worker/` to Cloudflare and set the three API keys as environment variables: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY`, `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`, `ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID`
2. Set `WorkerBaseUrl` in `CompanionManager.cs` to your deployed Worker URL
3. `dotnet run` from `clicky-windows/`
4. Hold `Ctrl+Alt` to talk

## How to build a release binary

```
dotnet publish clicky-windows/ClickyWindows.csproj -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained true -p:PublishSingleFile=true -p:IncludeNativeLibrariesForSelfExtract=true
```

Output: single `ClickyWindows.exe` in `clicky-windows/bin/Release/net8.0-windows/win-x64/publish/`

## What NOT to change without understanding

- The POINT regex — it handles Claude's inconsistent output format
- The `BeginAnimation(prop, null)` calls — removing them breaks cursor resumption
- The `_cursorPosAtPointEnd` logic — it's what makes the dot stay put until you move
- The UAC manifest level — needed for Task Manager capture
- The SSE parsing in `ClaudeApiClient` — Anthropic's SSE format has nested delta types
