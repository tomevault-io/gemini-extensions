# NWN MCP Server

MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for Neverwinter Nights Enhanced Edition module files (.mod). Wraps neverwinter.nim CLI tools to expose module content as structured, queryable data for LLMs.

## Working Style

- **Do NOT auto-export HTML reports** after creating or painting areas. Only export reports when the user explicitly asks for one.
- **Always repack after creating/painting test areas** so the user can see them in the toolset. Mention that you repacked.
- **MCP server restart required after code changes.** After editing TypeScript source and running `npm run build`, the MCP server must be restarted for new/changed tools to become available. Ask the user to restart before attempting to use newly added tools.
- **Keep skills in sync with tools.** When adding, renaming, or changing tool parameters/behavior, immediately update the `.claude/skills/` SKILL.md files that reference those tools. The LLM follows skill instructions, not tool schemas — if a skill doesn't mention a parameter, the LLM won't use it.

## Design Intent

This MCP serves two purposes:

**(a) AI-assisted human module design** — A human author works with an AI assistant to build, modify, and extend NWN modules via natural language. The human stays in creative control.

**(b) AI-driven creative module building** — A small, proof-of-concept tool for building one-shot adventures for yourself and friends. Spoiler-free by design, so the DM can be surprised too. An LLM autonomously designs and constructs module content based on high-level goals: generating quests, writing dialogue, designing areas, placing objects, building story. This is orchestrated via the `/create-adventure` skill and its sub-skill agents.

### Spatial Awareness

The `visualize_area` tool returns a **canonical JSON spatial payload** — the LLM's primary instrument for understanding an area (tile grid, walkable zones, zone connectivity, all placed objects with positions and properties). Call it before making placement or quest decisions.

**HTML export tools (`export_area_report`, `export_module_report`) are strictly for human inspection** — downstream of the JSON payload, never depended on by the MCP engine.

### Scope

Scoped to **non-persistent world (non-PW) modules** — single-player and small co-op campaigns. AI-driven content creation targets **instanced objects placed in areas** (GIT contents). Blueprint modification, palette-level changes, and deep 2DA/ruleset authoring are out of scope.

## Tech Stack

- **TypeScript** (ES2022, Node16 modules) — `npm run build` compiles to `dist/`
- **@modelcontextprotocol/sdk** — MCP server framework, stdio transport
- **zod** (v4) — tool parameter validation (MCP SDK requirement)
- **neverwinter.nim tools** — external binaries for binary format conversion

## Quick Start

```bash
npm run build        # Compile TypeScript to dist/
npm run dev          # Run directly with tsx (development)
npm run start        # Run compiled output
```

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `MCP_FOLDER_USERREPORTS` | *(empty)* | Directory where user-facing reports are saved. When unset, reports go to the module temp dir |
| `NIM_FOLDER_NWTOOLS` | *(empty)* | Path to neverwinter.nim binaries |
| `NWN_FOLDER_DATA` | *(empty)* | NWN game install dir — enables base game 2DA/TLK loading via resman |
| `NWN_FOLDER_USER` | *(empty)* | NWN user documents dir — enables custom TLK, HAK, override/, development/ loading |
| `MCP_FOLDER_TEMP` | `%TEMP%/nwn-mcp` | Temp directory for extracted modules |

## Architecture

```
.mod file → nwn_erf (extract) → temp dir → nwn_gff (parse each GFF → JSON)
  → in-memory ModuleIndex (tags, scripts, areas, dialogs, creatures, items)
    → MCP tool handlers serve queries & modifications
      → nwn_gff (serialize back) → nwn_erf (repack) → .mod file
```

One module loaded at a time. `load_module` must be called before any other tool.

### Tool Organization

Tools are split between **base tools** (human-orchestrated editing) and **adventure tools** (autonomous module building):

- **Base tools** (`src/tools/*.ts` except `adventure-tools.ts`) — 22 files covering reading, querying, editing, placement, and analysis. Used by both humans and the adventure creator.
- **Adventure tools** (`src/tools/adventure-tools.ts`) — Tools specific to the `/create-adventure` pipeline: `adventure_create_transition`, `adventure_find_walkable`, `adventure_generate_layout`, `adventure_apply_layout`, `adventure_list_features`.

All tools have **MCP annotations** (`readOnlyHint`, `destructiveHint`, `idempotentHint`) set via the 4th positional arg to `server.tool()`.

### Layout Generator

`adventure_generate_layout` (in `src/util/layout-generator.ts`) is server-side procedural layout generation that encodes the area design rules from `adventure-areas/SKILL.md`. Returns zones + crossers ready for `adventure_apply_layout`, plus transition points. Uses `computeValidPairs()` from `src/util/zone-solver.ts` to validate terrain adjacency chains.

#### Unified BSP Pipeline

All 10 styles use a single BSP pipeline, differentiated by `StyleConfig` presets in `layout-generator.ts`:

**Interior styles** (dungeon / cave / dwelling):
- **`dungeon`** — Moderate split variance (±15%), room sizes 60-100% of leaf, margin 2-3, 1 shortcut corridor, 50% S-curves, 30% L-shaped rooms.
- **`cave`** — High variance (±20%), small rooms (40-70% of leaf), margin 2-4, 3 shortcut corridors, 70% S-curves, 10% L-shapes.
- **`dwelling`** — Near-zero variance (±5%), rooms fill 85-100% of leaf, fixed margin 2, no shortcuts, 10% S-curves, no L-shapes.

**Exterior styles** (forest / rural / city / plains / desert / castle / tundra):
- Each has `wallKeywords` (border terrain), `floorKeywords` (room terrain), `crosserKeywords` (roads — unused as crossers, used for terrain corridor keyword matching).
- Obstacle patches (water, trees, cliff) placed inside rooms via `obstacleKeywords` + `obstacleChance`.
- Secondary crossers (stream/river) are **interior-only** — exterior styles never use crosser paths.

#### Layout Rules

- **BSP rooms**: minimum 3x3, margin >= 2 (enforced, never collapses to 1). `minLeaf = 6` ensures each leaf can fit a 3-tile room + 2-tile margin. Interior styles use `splitThreshold: 10` — minimum area for 4 rooms is 14x14 (12x12 playable). Exterior styles use `splitThreshold: 12` and `marginRange: [2, 2]` to guarantee rooms large enough for 2x3 building features — minimum area for 4 exterior rooms is 18x18 (16x16 playable). Room size is a random fraction of available leaf space, randomly offset within the leaf.
- **L-shaped rooms**: Adjacent BSP siblings may merge into a single zone with probability `nonRectChance`. The zone solver handles arbitrary shapes.
- **Corridor routing**: axis-overlap detection (straight connection at shared Y/X), L-bend fallback when rooms don't overlap on either axis.
- **S-curves**: Probability controlled by `sCurveChance`. Offsets middle third by 1 tile perpendicular. Bends only on interior wall tiles (never first/last).
- **Shortcut corridors**: `shortcutCount` controls how many T-junction shortcuts between non-adjacent rooms.
- **Interior corridors use crossers** (corridor type only, on wall tiles). **Exterior corridors carve floor terrain zones** through wall terrain — no crosser paths.
- **Corridor edge flags only point wall-to-wall**: crosser edges are NOT generated toward room tiles. Room-boundary corners handle the visual transition. Generating edges toward rooms requests combos like `wall/wall/floor/floor + corridor` that no tileset tile satisfies.
- **Crosser type**: use `corridor` (self-contained per tile). Never use `doorway` — doorway crossers require matched pairs on shared edges (arch geometry split between adjacent tiles).
- **Propagation guard**: crossers don't propagate onto tiles with any non-default corner (boundary or room tiles). Only pure-default tiles receive propagated crossers.
- **Room-corner crosser exclusion**: tiles diagonally adjacent to rooms (but NOT cardinally adjacent) are excluded from corridor crosser paths. These tiles get a single non-wall corner from the corner grid (3-wall+1-floor pattern) and no tileset has crosser tiles for that pattern. Room-EDGE tiles (cardinally adjacent) are kept — the solver's step 1.5 finds corridor-mouth tiles for them.
- **Solver scan-order**: solves bottom-to-top, left-to-right. Fallback chain: (1) exact corners+crossers, (1.5) adjust free corners+keep crossers, (2) exact corners+drop crossers, (3) adjust free corners+drop crossers, (4) all-default fallback. Step 1.5 finds "corridor mouth" tiles by adjusting room-edge corners. Adjustments are written back to the corner grid so downstream tiles see them.
- **Feature group filters**: groups with crosser edges or mismatched terrain corners are excluded from feature packing and `adventure_apply_layout`. Door-containing groups are allowed **only if** every door tile has all corners matching the floor terrain and no crosser edges — this lets freestanding buildings (houses, lodges) pass while rejecting corridor doors and transition doors. Terrain mismatch means a feature tile's corners don't all match the room's floor terrain — placing such a feature locks foreign corners into the grid, creating visual seams and forcing solver fallbacks on neighboring tiles.
- **Feature suggestions**: `suggestedFeatures` array in LayoutResult — packed into rooms targeting 50%+ tile coverage. `adventure_apply_layout` applies zones + crossers + features atomically. Pass `preferredFeatures` (array of group names from `get_tileset_details`) in `LayoutStyle` to prioritize plot-appropriate features over random selection.

### Resource Loading

On `load_module`, the server builds a full resman stack (lowest to highest priority):

1. **Base game BIFs** (via `NWN_FOLDER_DATA`)
2. **Module HAKs** (from `Mod_HakList` in IFO)
3. **User override/** (`NWN_FOLDER_USER/override/`)
4. **User development/** (`NWN_FOLDER_USER/development/`)
All 2DAs from the stack are extracted and parsed at load time (~598 base game tables). `load_module` accepts just a filename (e.g., `"mymod.mod"`) which resolves from `NWN_FOLDER_USER/modules/`.

## GFF Data Model

Every GFF field is type-wrapped: `{ type: "dword", value: 100 }`. Use helpers from `types/gff.ts`:
- `getFieldStr(obj, "Tag")` → unwraps cexostring/resref
- `getFieldNum(obj, "ChallengeRating")` → unwraps byte/char/word/dword/int/float/double
- `getFieldLocStr(obj, "FirstName")` → extracts text from cexolocstring (prefers lang 0/English)
- `getFieldLocStrResolved(obj, "FirstName", tlkLookup)` → resolves `[TLK:N]` strrefs via lookup function
- `getFieldList(obj, "Creature List")` → unwraps list to array of structs
- `setField(obj, "Tag", "cexostring", "my_tag")` → set or create a typed field
- `setFieldNum(obj, "Tile_ID", 42, "int")` / `setFieldStr(obj, "Tag", "my_tag")` → shorthands

`GffObj` type alias (`Record<string, unknown>`) used throughout. `GIT_STRUCT_ID` constants in `config.ts`: CREATURE=4, WAYPOINT=5, SOUND=6, ENCOUNTER=7, DOOR=8, PLACEABLE=9, STORE=11, TRIGGER=1.

## Object Placement

**Position fields differ by type:**
- Creatures/Waypoints/Triggers/Encounters/Sounds/Stores: `XPosition`, `YPosition`, `ZPosition`, `XOrientation`, `YOrientation`
- Placeables/Doors: `X`, `Y`, `Z`, `Bearing` (radians)

**Blueprint resolution chain:** module parsedGff cache → module resources on disk → resman (base game/HAKs, 120s timeout). Always deep-cloned before mutation.

## Walkmesh Caching

The `wok_cache/` directory is lazy-initialized on first use via `ensureWokCacheDir()` in `walkmesh.ts`. Reset on each `load_module` via `setWokCacheDir(tempDir)`. All walkmesh consumers (placement tools, paint tools) call `ensureWokCacheDir()` — never create the dir manually.

## Undo Stack

Simple undo stack for GIT mutations — `snapshotGitForUndo()` before each mutation, `popUndo()` to revert. Max 50 entries. MCP tools: `undo_last_change`, `undo_history` in `undo-tools.ts`. For bulk rollback of a failed phase, use `bulk_remove_objects` with tag patterns.

## Blueprint Discovery

`list_blueprints` tool searches the full resman stack (base game + HAKs + module) with 3-layer matching:
1. **Resref** — filename substring match
2. **Binary content** — finds tags and hardcoded locstring names in GFF data
3. **TLK names** — resolves strref-based names via `index.baseTlk`/`index.customTlk`

Returns type-specific summaries (utc: CR/race/classes, uti: baseItem/cost, etc.). Results cached in `blueprint_cache/`.

## Area Connectivity

`check_area_connectivity` tool does BFS from the module start area through linked doors/triggers. Returns reachable/unreachable areas and the full transition graph. Implemented in `analysis-tools.ts`, reuses `buildTagToAreaMap`/`buildAreaTransitions` from `tileset-tools.ts`.

## Area Transitions

Three mechanisms for moving between areas:
- **`link_doors`** — bidirectional door-to-door linking. Doors are two-way objects.
- **`create_area_transition`** — one-way trigger→waypoint transition. Places an Area Transition trigger (Type=1, LinkedToFlags=2=Waypoint) in the source area and a waypoint in the target area. Call twice with swapped source/target for two-way transitions.
- **`adventure_create_transition`** — **bidirectional** portal for adventure modules. Single call places a useable blue shaft of light (`plc_solblue`) AND a landing waypoint at both positions simultaneously, guaranteeing the light and waypoint in each area share exact coordinates. Each light's OnUsed script opens a dialog ("Step through?" / "Turn away"). On confirmation, plays VFX_FNF_SUMMON_MONSTER_2 and jumps the PC to the destination waypoint after 2 seconds. The `/create-adventure` pipeline uses this exclusively instead of `create_area_transition`.

## Trap Blueprints

`create_trap_blueprint` creates a UTT trigger blueprint with NWN trap fields: `TrapDetectDC`, `TrapDisarmable`, `TrapFlag`, `TrapOneShot`, and a default square geometry. Place with `place_trigger`.

## Quest Completability

`verify_quest_completability` traces all journal quests from quest-giver dialog through `AddJournalQuestEntry` script calls to the end entry. Checks area reachability. Returns structured gaps for each quest.

## Placement Collision Detection

`place_creature` (0.75m radius) and `place_placeable` (1.0m radius) check for nearby objects and **block placement** if another object is within range. The `collisionRadius` parameter on `place_creature` allows callers to override (pass `"0"` to disable).

## Walkability Enforcement

All placement and movement tools **block** if the target position is non-walkable or within 1m of a non-walkable surface. Uses `checkPlacementWalkable()` in `walkmesh.ts` which checks the target point plus 4 cardinal probes at a configurable distance (default 1m). `adventure_create_transition` uses a 2m buffer so portals stay clear of walls and cliff edges.

**Enforced on:** `place_creature`, `place_placeable`, `place_waypoint`, `place_trigger`, `place_encounter`, `place_store`, `move_object`, `bulk_move_objects`, `create_area_transition`, `adventure_create_transition` (both source and target positions).

**Excluded:** `place_door` (doors sit at tile boundaries near walls), `place_sound` (audio sources don't need walkable positions), movement of Door List and SoundList objects.

## Walkmesh Caching

The `wok_cache/` directory is lazy-initialized on first use via `ensureWokCacheDir()` in `walkmesh.ts`. Reset on each `load_module` via `setWokCacheDir(tempDir)`. All walkmesh consumers (placement tools, paint tools) call `ensureWokCacheDir()` — never create the dir manually.

## Object Height Correction

`fix_object_heights` adjusts Z height of all placed objects in an area (or all areas) to match the walkmesh ground plane. Iterates creatures, placeables, waypoints, triggers, encounters, stores, and sounds. Only adjusts objects where the walkmesh Z differs from the current Z by more than 0.01. The walkmesh check uses the highest walkable face at each position (handles overlapping faces at different heights).

## Zone-Based Terrain Solver

`adventure_apply_layout` (adventure tool) takes the full `LayoutResult` from `adventure_generate_layout` and applies zones + crossers + features atomically via the zone solver (`src/util/zone-solver.ts`). `paint_tiles` and `paint_group` are base tools for direct/manual tile placement — no solving.

`get_tileset_details` defaults to `detail: "summary"` (~2KB) which includes terrain types, crosser types, valid terrain adjacencies, and group names. Use `detail: "full"` for the complete 60-100KB tile catalog.

### Tile Matching Rules

The **only** determining factors for tile selection from .set files are:
- **Corner terrains:** `TopLeft`, `TopRight`, `BottomLeft`, `BottomRight`
- **Corner heights:** `TopLeftHeight`, `TopRightHeight`, `BottomLeftHeight`, `BottomRightHeight`
- **Edge crossers:** `Top`, `Right`, `Bottom`, `Left`
- **Orientation:** the `.set` `Orientation` field (0/90/180/270 degrees)

The `.set` file `[PRIMARY RULES]` and `[SECONDARY RULES]` sections are **NOT functional for tile solving**. They are toolset autotiling rules for terrain propagation when painting in the toolset. They do not restrict which tiles can be placed where. **IGNORE them entirely.**

### Tile Orientation Normalization

The `.set` `Orientation` field specifies the rotation (degrees) at which the tile's corners and crossers are defined in the file. At parse time in `tileset.ts`, corners and crossers are **un-rotated by the `.set` Orientation** to normalize all tiles to GIT orientation 0. This ensures `getRotatedCorners(tile, gitOri)` returns the correct effective corners for any GIT placement orientation.

The solver also **prefers tiles at their natural `.set` Orientation** — the rotation the 3D model was designed for — over rotated alternatives that produce the same corner pattern. This prevents visual artifacts from tiles whose model geometry doesn't align properly when placed at non-native orientations.

### Terrain Adjacency Constraint

**Zone layouts must respect tileset terrain adjacency chains.** Tilesets only have transition tiles between specific terrain pairs. If two terrains can't transition directly, a buffer zone of the intermediate terrain is REQUIRED — the solver will NOT fabricate intermediate terrains.

**Before designing zones**, call `get_tileset_details` and check which terrains have transition tiles between them. Common adjacency chains:
- `tno01` (Castle Exterior Rural): `Trees → Grass → CastleWall → Dirt`
- `ttr01` (Rural): `Trees → Grass` (+ Water, Dirt variants)

You cannot skip terrains in the chain. For example, in `tno01` you must place a 1-tile `Grass` zone between `Trees` and `CastleWall` — no direct Trees↔CastleWall transition tiles exist. The solver will warn and fall back to incorrect tiles if adjacencies are invalid.

## Known Pitfalls

- **`nwn_script_comp` positional arg.** Most nim tools use `-i <file>`, but `nwn_script_comp` takes the source file as a **positional argument** (last): `nwn_script_comp [options] [-o out] file.nss`. Using `-i` silently fails.
- **`nwn_twoda` no JSON.** Use `-k csv --write-id-column` instead. The CSV parser in `nim-tools.ts` handles it.
- **Numeric tool params must use `z.string()`.** The MCP SDK validates JSON Schema before Zod transforms execute, so `z.coerce.number()` fails when clients send strings. Use `z.string()` + `toF()`/`toI()` helpers from `src/util/params.ts`. Same for complex array params — use `z.string()` + `JSON.parse()`.
- **Resman tools are slow.** Every invocation initializes the full resman stack. Default timeout (30s) is too short for piped operations — `resmanCatToJson()` uses 120s.
- **Temp dir contains cache subdirs.** `resman_2da/`, `tileset_cache/`, `wok_cache/`, `blueprint_cache/` — all auto-excluded from `erfPack()` by the `isFile()` filter. Never pack these into the module.
- **`validate_module` false positives.** Base game scripts (`nw_c2_default5`, etc.) and items (`nw_wblms001`) are resolved at runtime — filter these "missing" references.
- **Primary/secondary rules in .set files are NOT functional and must be IGNORED.** They are toolset autotiling propagation rules, not tile placement constraints. The tile solver works entirely by matching corner terrains, corner heights, edge crossers, and the `.set` Orientation field.
- **Height tiles excluded from solving.** Tiles with any corner height > 0 are filtered out. All solver-placed tiles are flat.
- **Tile rotation: do NOT swap cases 1 and 3.** Case 1 = 90° CW, case 3 = 270° CW. Verified against `forwardRotate` + SVG normalization pipeline.
- **DLG field completeness is critical.** The NWN engine silently fails to load dialogs missing standard fields. Every entry/reply MUST include `Animation`, `AnimLoop`, `Comment`, `Delay`, `Quest`, `Script`, `Sound`. Every link struct MUST include `IsChild`. The `makeEntry`/`makeReply`/`makeLink` helpers in `dialog-write-tools.ts` handle this.
- **`create_dialog` condition field.** The `condition` on a node goes on the **link pointing to it** (`Active` field), not the node itself.
- **Tileset door placement.** Each tile's .set file has `[TILE<id>DOOR<n>]` subsections with local-space offsets. Use `getTileDoorWorldPositions()` in `tileset.ts` to convert to world space. Never guess door positions.
- **CPDB blob format.** Campaign database blobs (compressed=1) use a 24-byte header (`"CPDB"` + version + fields) followed by zstd-compressed data (NOT zlib). The payload is JSON text, not binary GFF. Vartype codes are ASCII chars: F=70 float, I=73 int, J=74 json, L=76 location, O=79 object, S=83 string, V=86 vector. F/I/L/V are uncompressed ASCII; J/O/S are CPDB/zstd compressed.
- **Database files are `.sqlite3`**, not `.sqlite`. Located in `NWN_FOLDER_USER/database/`.
- **GIT trigger field name is `TriggerList`** (no space), not `"Trigger List"`. Other no-space list names: `SoundList`, `StoreList`, `WaypointList`. With-space names: `Creature List`, `Door List`, `Encounter List`, `Placeable List`.
- **Triggers need Geometry in placed instances.** UTT blueprints from resman do NOT contain geometry. When placing triggers, always ensure the `Geometry` list field exists with at least 4 vertices (PointX/PointY/PointZ). Without geometry, the engine won't detect entry and the toolset won't render the trigger.
- **GIC must be synced with GIT.** The toolset uses the GIC file to index objects in an area. `writeBackGit()` automatically syncs the GIC. Without GIC entries, objects exist in the GIT but the toolset doesn't show them.
- **Placeable display name field is `LocName`**, not `LocalizedName`. Setting `LocalizedName` on a placeable has no effect — the toolset and engine read `LocName` (a cexolocstring).
- **Placement Z height from walkmesh.** All placement tools automatically set the object's Z position from the walkmesh surface height. The walkmesh check returns the highest walkable face Z at the position. Use `fix_object_heights` to retroactively fix objects placed before this feature.
- **Zone solver rejects incompatible adjacencies.** `adventure_apply_layout` returns early with zero placements and `INCOMPATIBLE TERRAIN ADJACENCY` errors if the zone layout contains terrain pairs with no transition tiles. Fix the zone layout, don't retry.
- **`fallbackSubstitute` is constrained.** The zone solver's fallback only tries terrains present in the corner grid (zone-defined + default). It will never inject an alien terrain.
