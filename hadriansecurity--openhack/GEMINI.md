# Agent Instructions

This repository is a file-based openhack workspace. When a human asks to
start, initiate, run, resume, or continue a pentest/security review, use the
tool structure before doing vulnerability analysis.

## Required Pentest Flow

Do not begin with a broad LLM source sweep, direct expert pass, or ad hoc manual
review of the target repository.

For a new target, use phase checkpoints:

1. Run `openhack init-run <target> <git-url> [--run-id <run-id>] [--branch <branch>]`.
2. Summarize the created run and source commit, then ask the human what
   security experts to use before recon. Show every configured expert and the
   option `all agents`.
3. Run `openhack run-recon <target> <run-id> --all-agents`
   only after approval, or run it with one or more `--expert <expert-id>`
   options if the human selected a subset.
4. Summarize recon counts and artifacts; ask whether to proceed to scenario
   routing and backlog generation. If the human wants deeper source-pattern
   coverage, rerun recon with `--semgrep` before scenario routing. Recon writes
   `routing-units.jsonl`; treat those clustered units as the primary router
   input instead of asking the router to reason over the full raw inventory dump.
5. After approval, run `openhack create-scenarios <target> <run-id>`, have the
   scenario-router answer the rendered prompt, and record that router output
   with `openhack record-scenario-backlog <target> <run-id> router-result.json`
   without inserting another human confirmation between prompt creation and
   backlog recording. The scenario-router must use the expert scope recorded
   before recon; do not create scenarios for unselected experts. The router must
   route from mandatory `routing_unit_id + expert` pairs when routing units are
   present, and use path/expert coverage requirements as a compatibility
   backstop.
6. Summarize backlog size and coverage notes; ask for one approval to run the
   entire unfinished scenario backlog. Batch approval is not batch analysis:
   every scenario still needs its own rendered prompt, source review, evidence,
   and result.
7. Review only recorded `runs/<target>/<run-id>/scenarios/backlog/S*.md` expert
   prompts and record results with `openhack record-scenario-result <target> <run-id> ...`.
   This records finished scenario results and `finding-candidates/`; it does not
   create final `findings/`.
8. Summarize finding-candidate count and ask once to run the entire unfinished
    finding triage backlog. Every candidate must use its own rendered
    `runs/<target>/<run-id>/finding-triage/prompts/S###-F###.md` prompt and its
    own finding-triage subagent. Render prompts with
    `openhack render-finding-triage-prompt <target> <run-id> <candidate-id>`.
9. Record each finding-triage agent answer with
    `openhack record-finding-triage <target> <run-id> <candidate-id> triage-result.json`.
    Only `accepted` and `downgraded` triage decisions may materialize final
    `findings/`.
10. Validate with `openhack validate-run <target> <run-id>`.

Do not begin vulnerability analysis from recon alone. Recon is only a scouting
phase; summarize it and ask before scenario routing. Do not treat the
scenario-router prompt as a human checkpoint or as final output; the approved
routing phase records router output into `scenarios/index.jsonl` and
`scenarios/backlog/` before pausing again.

Do not present a sample of scenarios as complete coverage. There is no fixed scenario quota:
the correct amount is however many concrete scenarios are needed to cover the
credible recon evidence. Route every mandatory routing unit, every route/input
file with a sink or exposure hint, every credible expert opportunity, and every
distinct endpoint, parameter, role, parser, storage path, trust boundary, or
deployment alias. If the backlog is small, record coverage notes that explain
why the evidence is genuinely small. One scenario has one primary expert, but
the same routing unit, file, path, or recon item must be routed to every
relevant expert as separate scenarios. Do not let a single expert assignment
suppress other plausible root-cause families. Once a
backlog exists, ask once to run the entire unfinished backlog as a continuous
scenario loop; then iterate over every `scenarios/backlog/S*.json` item
individually. Do not ask again at internal ranges such as `S021-S070`; those are
progress chunks only, not human checkpoints. Do not replace per-scenario expert
review with a broad classification, sampling pass, or templated rejection. Only
write `scenarios/finished/S*.json` after reading that scenario prompt and the
relevant source. If the full backlog cannot be reviewed, stop and report the
remaining scenario IDs instead of marking them finished.

After scenario review, finding triage is a second continuous loop. Ask once to
run all unfinished `finding-candidates/S###-F###.json` candidates through the
`finding-triage` agent, then process each candidate individually. Do not mark a
candidate triaged from the scenario result alone, and do not create final
`findings/*.md` without a recorded triage decision.

Every scenario must be run by its own subagent. The rendered
`runs/<target>/<run-id>/scenarios/backlog/S*.md` file is the exact prompt for
that scenario's subagent. The orchestrator may schedule subagents, collect their
JSON answers, and record those answers, but it must not answer multiple
scenarios itself, synthesize results from a template, or mark scenarios finished
without a returned per-scenario subagent review. A bundled result file may only
contain a small set of already-returned subagent answers; it is never a shortcut
for running scenarios.

Every finding candidate must also be run by its own independent finding-triage
subagent. The rendered
`runs/<target>/<run-id>/finding-triage/prompts/S###-F###.md` file is the exact
prompt for that triage subagent. The triage agent must perform due diligence on
reportability, duplicate/scope boundaries, confidence, and severity; the
scenario expert's severity is evidence, not the final rating.

For efficiency, the orchestrator may group unfinished scenarios by expert and use
`openhack next-expert-queue <target> <run-id> --expert <expert> --limit <n>`
to choose a bounded dispatch set. Expert grouping is scheduling only: an expert
queue is not an expert batch review, and no subagent may produce results for
more than one scenario. Each result must include `review_mode:
"per-scenario-subagent"`, a unique `subagent_id`, the rendered prompt hash, the
reviewed source files, and evidence snippets that match cited source lines.

For an existing run, inspect `run-config.yaml`, `plan.md`, `recon-output/`,
`scenarios/index.jsonl`, `scenarios/backlog/`, `scenarios/finished/`,
`finding-candidates/`, `finding-triage/`, and `findings/` to determine the next
missing phase. Summarize the current state and ask before continuing from the
first missing durable phase instead of starting over, unless the only gap is
recording the scenario backlog and the human already approved recon-to-backlog
routing in the current session. If unfinished backlog scenarios remain, ask to
process all of them as one approved continuous loop rather than asking for
confirmation one scenario or range at a time. If unfinished finding candidates
remain, ask once to process all of them as one approved continuous triage loop.

## Durable Model

The required flow is:

`recon item -> routing unit -> scenario -> scenario result -> finding candidate -> triage decision -> finding`

Verified findings must be recorded through `scenarios/finished/`,
`finding-candidates/`, `finding-triage/decisions/`, and `findings/`. Expert
analysis outside a recorded scenario may create routing input, candidate notes,
or `needs_context`, but it should not create final findings.

## Generated Run Artifacts

Treat `runs/**`, target source code, and generated review artifacts as run data.
Do not commit target source or generated run artifacts unless the human
explicitly asks for that.

Logs are structured. The tool writes `logs/events.jsonl` and `trace.jsonl`; it
does not write `human.log`.

## Artifact Discipline

All work must remain within the run folder (`runs/<target>/<run-id>/`). Never write
intermediate analysis, scratch files, or temporary state to system temp directories
(`/tmp/`, `/var/`, etc.). Instead:

- Use designated run subdirectories: `results-pending/`, `finding-triage/decisions/`, `.scratch/`, or create task-specific subdirs.
- All artifacts (including intermediate computation files, mappings, logs) are part of the durable engagement state.
- If intermediate state is needed only within a single agent invocation, hold it in memory; do not write to `/tmp/`.
- The run folder is the canonical record of the engagement. System temp files are not auditable, not archivable, and break reproducibility.
