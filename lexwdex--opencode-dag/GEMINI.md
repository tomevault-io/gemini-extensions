## Git Workflow (铁律)

```
feat/**, fix/** ──PR(Typecheck 门禁)──▶ dev ──push 触发全量测试──▶
    dev ──手动 release-fork──▶ prerelease 测试版
    dev ──PR(全量测试门禁)──▶ main ──手动 release-fork──▶ 正式版
```

**分层门禁**：`dev` 是快速集成层（仅 Typecheck），`main` 是正式质量门禁（Typecheck + 全量 Unit Tests + E2E）。所有改动通过 PR 流转，禁止直推 `main` 和 `dev`（由 GitHub Rulesets 强制）。

| Branch | 直推 | PR 门禁 | CI 触发 | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|---------|---------|
| `{type}/**` | ✅ 允许 | — | ❌ 不跑 | 开发分支，频繁变更 |
| `dev` | ❌ 禁止 | PR 必须通过 **Typecheck** | ✅ push 触发 Typecheck + 全量测试 | 快速集成层 |
| `main` | ❌ 禁止 | PR 必须通过 **Typecheck + Unit Tests + E2E (linux + windows)** | ✅ push 触发全量 | 正式质量门禁 + 发版 |

**流程**：
1. 从 `main` 切出 `feat/**` 或 `fix/**` 分支开发
2. PR → `dev`（Typecheck 门禁，快速合并）
3. push 到 `dev` 自动触发全量测试验证
4. 从 `dev` 手动 `release-fork` → 产出 **prerelease** 测试版
5. PR `dev` → `main`（全量测试门禁：Typecheck + Unit Tests + E2E）
6. 合并到 `main` 后手动 `release-fork` → 产出**正式版**

**Rulesets（GitHub Settings → Rules → Rulesets）**：
- `protect-main`：禁止直推/删除/force-push；PR 需通过 4 项检查（Typecheck、Unit Tests (linux)、E2E Tests (linux)、E2E Tests (windows)）
- `protect-dev`：禁止直推/删除/force-push；PR 需通过 Typecheck
- `branch-naming`：只允许创建 `feat/**`、`fix/**`、`chore/**`、`docs/**`、`refactor/**`、`test/**`、`release/**`、`hotfix/**` 前缀的新分支

**CI 配置**：
- `ci-typecheck.yml`：push 到 `main`/`dev` + PR → `main`/`dev` 时触发（快速门禁）
- `ci-test.yml`：push 到 `main`/`dev` + PR → `main` 时触发全量测试（`cancel-in-progress: false` 保证跑完）
- `release-fork.yml`：手动触发；从 `dev` 发布自动标记 `--prerelease`，从 `main` 发布正式版

## Branch Names

Format: `{type}/{short-name}` where `type` is one of: `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `release`, `hotfix`. The short name uses hyphens, at most three words. Enforced by GitHub Ruleset `branch-naming`.

Examples: `feat/session-recovery`, `fix/scroll-state`, `docs/branch-naming`, `refactor/dag-spawn`, `test/auth-flow`, `chore/regenerate-sdk`, `release/v1.18`, `hotfix/critical-patch`.

## Commits and PR Titles

Use conventional commit-style messages and PR titles: `type(scope): summary`.

Valid types are `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `chore`, `refactor`, and `test`. Scopes are optional; use the affected package or area when helpful, e.g. `core`, `opencode`, `tui`, `app`, `desktop`, `sdk`, or `plugin`.

Examples: `fix(tui): simplify thinking toggle styling`, `docs: update contributing guide`, `chore(sdk): regenerate types`.

## Style Guide

### General Principles

- Keep things in one function unless composable or reusable
- Do not extract single-use helpers preemptively. Inline the logic at the call site unless the helper is reused, hides a genuinely complex boundary, or has a clear independent name that improves the caller.
- Avoid `try`/`catch` where possible
- Avoid using the `any` type
- Use Bun APIs when possible, like `Bun.file()`
- Rely on type inference when possible; avoid explicit type annotations or interfaces unless necessary for exports or clarity
- Prefer functional array methods (flatMap, filter, map) over for loops; use type guards on filter to maintain type inference downstream
- In `src/config`, follow the existing self-export pattern at the top of the file (for example `export * as ConfigAgent from "./agent"`) when adding a new config module.
- In Effect generators, bind services to named variables before calling methods. Do not use nested service yields such as `yield* (yield* Foo.Service).bar()`.

Reduce total variable count by inlining when a value is only used once.

```ts
// Good
const journal = await Bun.file(path.join(dir, "journal.json")).json()

// Bad
const journalPath = path.join(dir, "journal.json")
const journal = await Bun.file(journalPath).json()
```

### Destructuring

Avoid unnecessary destructuring. Use dot notation to preserve context.

```ts
// Good
obj.a
obj.b

// Bad
const { a, b } = obj
```

### Imports

- Never alias imports. Do not use `import { foo as bar } from "..."` or renamed imports like `resolve as pathResolve`.
- Never use star imports. Do not use `import * as Foo from "..."` or `import type * as Foo from "..."`.
- If a namespace-style value is needed, import the module's own exported namespace by name, for example `import { Project } from "@opencode-ai/core/project"`, then reference `Project.ID`.
- Prefer dynamic imports for heavy modules that are only needed in selected code paths, especially in startup-sensitive entrypoints. Destructure dynamic import bindings near the top of the narrowest scope that needs them so they read like normal imports. Avoid inline chains such as `await import("./module").then((mod) => mod.value())` or `(await import("./module")).value()`. Keep branch-specific imports inside the branch that needs them to preserve lazy loading.

### Variables

Prefer `const` over `let`. Use ternaries or early returns instead of reassignment.

```ts
// Good
const foo = condition ? 1 : 2

// Bad
let foo
if (condition) foo = 1
else foo = 2
```

### Control Flow

Avoid `else` statements. Prefer early returns.

```ts
// Good
function foo() {
  if (condition) return 1
  return 2
}

// Bad
function foo() {
  if (condition) return 1
  else return 2
}
```

### Complex Logic

When a function has several validation branches or supporting details, make the main function read as the happy path and move supporting details into small helpers below it.

```ts
// Good
export function loadThing(input: unknown) {
  const config = requireConfig(input)
  const metadata = readMetadata(input)
  return createThing({ config, metadata })
}

function requireConfig(input: unknown) {
  ...
}
```

- Keep helpers close to the code they support, below the main export when that improves readability.
- Do not over-abstract simple expressions into many single-use helpers; extract only when it names a real concept like `requireConfig` or `readMetadata`.
- Do not return `Effect` from helpers unless they actually perform effectful work. Synchronous parsing, validation, and option building should stay synchronous.
- Prefer Effect schema helpers such as `Schema.UnknownFromJsonString` and `Schema.decodeUnknownOption` over manual `JSON.parse` wrapped in `Effect.try` when parsing untrusted JSON strings.
- Add comments for non-obvious constraints and surprising behavior, not for obvious assignments or control flow.

### Schema Definitions (Drizzle)

Use snake_case for field names so column names don't need to be redefined as strings.

```ts
// Good
const table = sqliteTable("session", {
  id: text().primaryKey(),
  project_id: text().notNull(),
  created_at: integer().notNull(),
})

// Bad
const table = sqliteTable("session", {
  id: text("id").primaryKey(),
  projectID: text("project_id").notNull(),
  createdAt: integer("created_at").notNull(),
})
```

## Testing

- Avoid mocks as much as possible, you shouldn't be using globalThis.\* at all unless it's the only option.
- Test actual implementation, do not duplicate logic into tests
- Tests cannot run from repo root (guard: `do-not-run-tests-from-root`); run from package dirs like `packages/opencode`.

## Type Checking

- Always run `bun typecheck` from package directories (e.g., `packages/opencode`), never `tsc` directly.
- `bun run build` does not typecheck — esbuild transpiles only. A green build can still ship a missing import or a non-existent API, so it is not proof the code is sound. `bun typecheck` (`tsgo --noEmit`) is the commit gate.

## Extending the Codebase (二次开发)

Guiding invariants for adding services, HTTP API routes, or features. The build pipeline will not catch violations of these — only an understanding of the architecture will. Read the surrounding modules first (the Todo module is the reference for a lightweight, self-contained service) before wiring new dependencies.

- Keep each `X.defaultLayer` self-contained. It must `Layer.provide` every dependency its layer body `yield*`s at construction. `Layer.provideMerge(self, layer)` builds `layer` in isolation — the context accumulated by `self` is not fed to it — and `Layer.mergeAll` does not cross-provide siblings. A layer that quietly assumes an ambient service will construct in one entry point and crash in another, surfacing as a runtime crash or a blank/unresponsive TUI rather than a build error.
- `LayerNode` (`.node` exports, `LayerNode.buildLayer`) is a second, parallel composition system, separate from `defaultLayer`/`AppLayer`. The same self-containment rule applies per node, but the two systems don't share wiring. When adding a service that other services should see, find every consumer's `.node` list (not just its `defaultLayer`) and add the new service's node there.
- Resolve optional or heavyweight cross-dependencies lazily. When a service needs something already built elsewhere in `AppLayer` — especially something with deep transitive deps (Provider, MCP, HttpClient) — reach for `Effect.serviceOption(Tag)` at the call site instead of a hard `yield* Tag` in the layer body. This keeps the layer lightweight, leaves the consumer's requirements (`R`) empty, and stops transitive deps from being dragged into every entry point that builds the layer. A missing wire here compiles clean and fails silently (feature just no-ops) instead of erroring — grep every `Effect.serviceOption(X.Service)` call site, confirm X's node/layer actually reaches it, and verify with an integration test that exercises the behavior, not just that the layer builds.
- Regenerate the JS SDK after touching HTTP API routes. The SDK under `packages/sdk/js` is generated from the API's OpenAPI spec; adding or renaming a route does not update it. A stale SDK breaks the TUI at runtime — calling a client method that does not yet exist — in a way typecheck cannot catch, because the generated types are the client's source of truth. After route changes, run `./packages/sdk/js/script/build.ts` and rebuild the consumers.
- Changing an HTTP API route's request/response shape requires updating its scenario in `test/server/httpapi-exercise/index.ts`. `bun run test:httpapi --fail-on-missing` fails CI otherwise.

## V2 Session Core

- Keep durable prompt admission separate from model execution. `SessionV2.prompt(...)` admits one durable `session_input` row before scheduling advisory `SessionExecution.wake(sessionID)` unless `resume: false` requests admit-only behavior. The serialized runner promotes admitted inputs into visible user messages at safe boundaries.
- Reusing a Session ID adopts the existing Session. Reusing a prompt message ID reconciles an exact retry only when Session, prompt, and delivery mode match; conflicting reuse fails. Historical projected prompts lazily synthesize promoted inbox records during exact retry.
- Keep `SessionExecution` process-global and Session-ID based. Its local implementation owns the process-local Session coordinator and discovers placement through `SessionStore` plus `LocationServiceMap.get(session.location)` only when a drain starts; no layer should take a Session ID. V2 interruption targets the active process-local ownership chain for that Session; idle or missing interruption is a no-op.
- Keep `SessionRunner`, model resolution, tool registry, permissions, and filesystem Location-scoped. Omitted `Location.workspaceID` means implicit-local placement; explicit workspace identity remains reserved for future placement semantics.
- Preserve one explicit `llm.stream(request)` call per provider turn and reload projected history before durable continuation. Do not bridge through legacy `SessionPrompt.loop(...)` or delegate orchestration to an in-memory tool loop.
- Keep local Session drains process-local until clustering is implemented. `SessionRunCoordinator` joins explicit same-Session resumes, coalesces prompt wakeups, and allows different Sessions to run concurrently. Advisory wakes drain eligible durable inbox rows only; post-crash continuation recovery requires a separate explicit design before it may retry provider work. A drain has no durable identity or transcript boundary.
- Keep delivery vocabulary explicit. Prompts steer by default and promote at the next safe provider-turn boundary while the current drain requires continuation. An explicit `queue` input remains pending until the Session would otherwise become idle; promote one queued input at that boundary, then reevaluate continuation before promoting another. Promoting any new user input resets the selected agent's provider-turn allowance; a batch of steers resets it once.
- Keep EventV2 replay owner claims separate from clustered Session execution ownership.
- Keep the System Context algebra, registry, and built-ins in `src/system-context`; keep Context Source producers with their observed domains, and keep Session History selection plus Context Epoch persistence Session-owned.
