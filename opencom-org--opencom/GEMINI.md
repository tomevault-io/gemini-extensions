# AGENTS

## Non-negotiables

- Use **PNPM** commands in this repo (workspace uses `pnpm-workspace.yaml`).
- Always run new/updated tests after creating or changing them.
- Prefer focused verification first (targeted package/spec), then broader checks when needed.
- At the end of each proposal when ready for a PR, run `pnpm ci:check` to ensure all checks pass.

## Quick Repo Orientation

- Monorepo root: `opencom`
- Main apps: `apps/web`, `apps/landing`, `apps/mobile`, `apps/widget`
- Backend: `packages/convex`
- OpenSpec source of truth: `openspec/changes/<change-name>/`

## General Workflow Guardrails

- Start every non-trivial task by grounding in current repo state before changing files:
  1. identify the active scope
  2. read the relevant files/specs/tests
  3. verify whether the work is already partly done
  4. choose a narrow verification plan
- If working from an existing OpenSpec change, always read:
  - `openspec status --change "<change-name>" --json`
  - `openspec instructions apply --change "<change-name>" --json`
  - the current `proposal.md`, `design.md`, `specs/**/*.md`, and `tasks.md`
- Never assume unchecked boxes in `tasks.md` mean the code is still missing. Verify the current implementation first, then update artifacts or tasks to match reality.
- Before creating a new OpenSpec change, quickly check for overlapping active changes or existing specs so you do not create duplicates or split ownership accidentally.
- For multi-step work, keep an explicit plan/todo and update it as tasks complete. Prefer one active task at a time.
- When changing course mid-task, record the new scope and the reason in the active change artifacts if they are affected.
- Before marking work complete, verify both code and artifacts:
  - code/tests/typechecks reflect the final state
  - `tasks.md` checkboxes match what is actually done
  - any follow-up work is written down explicitly instead of left implicit

## Existing Proposal Discipline

- If you did not create the current proposal/change, treat the artifacts as hypotheses until verified against the codebase.
- Separate findings into three buckets before editing artifacts:
  - already implemented
  - still unfinished
  - intentionally out of scope or accepted exception
- Only put unfinished work into active proposal/spec/task artifacts.
- If code and artifacts disagree, prefer fixing the artifact first unless the user explicitly asked for implementation.
- When leaving partial progress, record exact remaining file clusters, blockers, and verification still needed so a later pass can continue without re-auditing the whole repo.

## High-Value Commands (copy/paste)

### Typecheck

- Convex only:
  - `pnpm --filter @opencom/convex typecheck`
- Web only:
  - `pnpm --filter @opencom/web typecheck`
- Whole workspace:
  - `pnpm typecheck`

### Convex TypeScript deep-instantiation workaround

- Canonical guide: `docs/convex-type-safety-playbook.md`
- If Convex typecheck hits `TS2589` (`Type instantiation is excessively deep and possibly infinite`) at generated refs like `api.foo.bar` or `internal.foo.bar`, prefer a **local escape hatch** instead of broad weakening.
- First keep call signatures shallow at the hot spot:
  - cast `ctx.scheduler.runAfter`, `ctx.runQuery`, or `ctx.runMutation` to a local shallow function type.
- If merely referencing `api...` / `internal...` still triggers `TS2589`, use `makeFunctionReference("module:function")` from `convex/server` at that call site instead of property access on generated refs.
- Keep this workaround **localized only to pathological sites**. Continue using generated `api` / `internal` refs normally elsewhere.
- Expect hidden follow-on errors: rerun `pnpm --filter @opencom/convex typecheck` after each small batch of fixes, because resolving one deep-instantiation site can reveal additional ones.

## Convex Type Safety Standards

- Read `docs/convex-type-safety-playbook.md` before adding new Convex boundaries.
- Frontend runtime/UI modules must not import `convex/react` directly. Use local adapters and wrapper hooks instead.
- Keep Convex refs at module scope. Never create `makeFunctionReference(...)` values inside React components or hooks.
- Do not add new `getQueryRef(name: string)`, `getMutationRef(name: string)`, or `getActionRef(name: string)` factories.
- Backend cross-function calls should use generated `api` / `internal` refs by default. Only move to fixed `makeFunctionReference("module:function")` refs after a real `TS2589` hotspot is confirmed.
- Keep unavoidable casts localized to adapters or named backend hotspot helpers. Do not spread `as unknown as`, `unsafeApi`, or `unsafeInternal` through runtime code.
- After changing a boundary, update the relevant hardening guard:
  - `packages/convex/tests/runtimeTypeHardeningGuard.test.ts`
  - `apps/web/src/app/typeHardeningGuard.test.ts`
  - `apps/widget/src/test/refHardeningGuard.test.ts`
  - `packages/react-native-sdk/tests/hookBoundaryGuard.test.ts`

## Convex Hardening Audit Triage

- Before treating an audit item as open work, verify whether it is already implemented and only the guard/proposal text is stale.
- Default classification for current repo state:
  - `packages/sdk-core/src/api/*.ts` manual fixed refs are generally **approved TS2589 hotspots**, not automatic cleanup targets.
  - `packages/sdk-core/src/api/aiAgent.ts` already routes `getRelevantKnowledge` through `client.action(...)`; do not reopen the old query-path migration unless you find a current regression.
  - `packages/convex/convex/embeddings.ts` batching/backfill concurrency work is already in place; do not create new perf tasks for `generateBatch`, `backfillExisting`, or `generateBatchInternal` unless the current code regressed.
  - `packages/convex/convex/testAdmin.ts` is an explicit dynamic exception because it intentionally dispatches caller-selected internal test mutations.
- Treat these patterns differently:
  - **Remaining cleanup target:** generic `name: string` ref helpers such as `makeInternalQueryRef(name)` / `getQueryRef(name)` in covered runtime files.
  - **Usually acceptable hotspot:** fixed module-scope `makeFunctionReference("module:function")` constants with a narrow comment or guard-railed `TS2589` justification.
  - **Accepted exception:** intentionally dynamic dispatch that is security-constrained and documented (currently `testAdmin.ts`).
- When cleaning backend Convex boundaries, prefer this order:
  1. Generated `api` / `internal` refs
  2. Named shallow runner helper at the hot spot
  3. Fixed `makeFunctionReference("module:function")` constant
  4. Only if intentionally dynamic and documented, a narrow exception
- Do not add new generic helper factories to shared ref modules. If a module exists to share refs, export fixed named refs from it.

## Testing Best Practices

### Do

- Create isolated test data using helpers
- Clean up after tests
- Use descriptive test names
- Test both success and error cases
- Use `data-testid` attributes for E2E selectors
- Keep tests focused and independent

### Don't

- Share state between tests
- Rely on specific database IDs
- Skip cleanup in afterAll
- Hard-code timeouts (use Playwright's auto-wait)


## Code Style and Comments

### Comment Tags

Use these tags to highlight important information in code comments:

- `IMPORTANT:` - Critical information that must not be overlooked
- `NOTE:` - Helpful context or clarification
- `WARNING:` - Potential pitfalls or dangerous operations
- `TODO:` - Future work that should be done
- `FIXME:` - Known issues that need fixing

### Code Patterns

- Use `MUST` / `MUST NOT` for hard requirements
- Use `NEVER` / `ALWAYS` for absolute rules
- Use `AVOID` for anti-patterns to stay away from
- Use `DO NOT` for explicit prohibitions

### Example

```typescript
// IMPORTANT: This function must be called before any Convex operations
// NOTE: The widget uses Shadow DOM, so overlays must portal into the shadow root
// WARNING: Never fall back to wildcard "*" for CORS
// TODO: Add rate limiting to this endpoint
// FIXME: This cast should be removed after TS2589 is resolved
```

## Modularity Patterns

### Module Organization

- Separate orchestration from rendering
- Extract helper logic from page components
- Use explicit domain modules instead of co-locating all logic
- Preserve existing behavior when refactoring

### Key Principles

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each module should have one clear purpose
2. **Explicit Contracts**: Modules must expose typed internal contracts
3. **Preserve Semantics**: Refactoring must preserve existing behavior
4. **Shared Utilities**: Common logic should be extracted to shared modules

### Common Patterns

- **Controller/View Separation**: Separate orchestration from rendering
- **Domain Modules**: Group related functionality by domain
- **Adapter Pattern**: Use adapters for external dependencies
- **Wrapper Hooks**: Wrap external hooks with local adapters

## Error Handling Patterns

### Standard Error Functions

Use the standardized error functions from `packages/convex/convex/utils/errors.ts`:

- `throwNotFound(resourceType)` - Resource not found
- `throwNotAuthenticated()` - Authentication required
- `throwPermissionDenied(permission?)` - Permission denied

### Error Feedback

- Use standardized non-blocking error feedback for frontend paths
- Provide actionable user messaging
- Centralize unknown error mapping for covered paths

## Documentation Standards

### Source of Truth

- OpenSpec specs are the source of truth for requirements
- `docs/` contains reference documentation
- `AGENTS.md` contains AI agent guardrails
- Code comments provide inline guidance

### When to Update Docs

- When adding new features or changing behavior
- When fixing bugs that affect user-facing behavior
- When refactoring that changes module boundaries
- When adding new patterns or conventions

## Agent Handoff Notes

- When converting a repo audit into OpenSpec artifacts, put **only unfinished work** into `proposal.md`, spec deltas, and `tasks.md`.
- Explicitly call out already-finished adjacent work so a follow-up agent does not reopen it by mistake.
- For the current Convex hardening area, the default out-of-scope items are:
  - sdk-core `getRelevantKnowledge` action routing
  - embedding batching/backfill concurrency in `packages/convex/convex/embeddings.ts`
- If you change the covered hardening inventory or accepted exceptions, update the matching guard in the same change. Common files:
  - `packages/convex/tests/runtimeTypeHardeningGuard.test.ts`
  - `packages/sdk-core/tests/refHardeningGuard.test.ts`
- When leaving work half-finished, record the remaining file clusters explicitly in `openspec/changes/<change>/tasks.md` so the next agent can resume without re-auditing the repo.

### Tests

- Convex targeted file:
  - `pnpm --filter @opencom/convex test -- --run tests/<file>.test.ts`
- Convex full package tests:
  - `pnpm --filter @opencom/convex test`
- Web unit tests:
  - `pnpm --filter @opencom/web test`
- Web E2E (single file):
  - `pnpm playwright test apps/web/e2e/<spec>.ts --project=chromium`

### E2E prep that is often required

- Build/distribute widget before web E2E runs:
  - `bash scripts/build-widget-for-tests.sh`
- If Convex-backed tests need env values loaded in shell:
  - `bash -lc 'set -a; source packages/convex/.env.local; set +a; <your command>'`

## OpenSpec Workflow Cheatsheet

### Check change status

- `openspec status --change "<change-name>" --json`

### Get apply context + progress

- `openspec instructions apply --change "<change-name>" --json`

### Validate before marking done

- `openspec validate <change-name> --strict --no-interactive`

### Important artifact dependency rule (spec-driven schema)

- `tasks.md` can stay **blocked** until both `design.md` and `specs/**/*.md` are ready.
- If status shows:
  - `tasks: blocked`
  - `missingDeps: ["design", "specs"]`
    this is expected; finish design/spec artifacts first.

## Recommended Finish Checklist for Changes

1. Implement scoped code changes.
2. Run package-level typecheck(s).
3. Run targeted tests for touched area.
4. Run strict OpenSpec validation.
5. Update `openspec/changes/<change>/tasks.md` checkboxes.
6. Sync tracker in `openspec/proposal-execution-plan.md` when proposal status changes.

## Skills / Slash Commands to Prefer

- `/opsx-apply` — implement tasks for a change
- `/opsx-continue` — advance artifact workflow
- `/opsx-verify` — verify implementation vs artifacts
- `/opsx-archive` — archive completed change

Use these when working within OpenSpec-driven requests to reduce setup time in fresh chats.

Warning: Running scripts inline causes the terminal to hang and crash. Create files and run them that way. Avoid running commmands like `... node - <<"NODE ..."` or `python3 - <<'PY' ...`


# Convex Type Safety Playbook

This is the canonical guide for adding or changing Convex-backed code in this repo.

Use it when you are:

- adding a new Convex `query`, `mutation`, or `action`
- calling one Convex function from another
- wiring a new frontend feature to Convex
- hitting `TS2589` (`Type instantiation is excessively deep and possibly infinite`)
- deciding where a cast or `makeFunctionReference(...)` is acceptable

Historical hardening notes still exist in `openspec/archive/refactor-*` and `runtime-type-hardening-2026-03-05.md`, but this file is the current source of truth for new code.

## Goals

- Keep runtime and UI code on explicit, local types.
- Keep unavoidable Convex typing escape hatches small and centralized.
- Prevent new generic string-ref factories, broad casts, and component-local ref creation.
- Make it obvious which pattern to use for each call site.

## Decision Table

| Situation                                                                   | Preferred approach                                                                                | Where                                   | Why                                                           |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Define a new public Convex query or mutation                                | Export a normal Convex function with narrow `v.*` args and a narrow return shape                  | `packages/convex/convex/**`             | Keeps the source contract explicit and reusable               |
| Call Convex from web or widget UI/runtime code                              | Use the local surface adapter plus a feature-local wrapper hook or fixed ref constant             | `apps/web/src/**`, `apps/widget/src/**` | Keeps `convex/react` and ref typing out of runtime/UI modules |
| Call one Convex function from another and generated refs typecheck normally | Use generated `api.*` / `internal.*` refs                                                         | `packages/convex/convex/**`             | This is the default, simplest path                            |
| Call one Convex function from another and generated refs hit `TS2589`       | Add a local shallow `runQuery` / `runMutation` / `runAction` / `runAfter` helper                  | the hotspot file only                   | Shrinks type instantiation at the call boundary               |
| The generated ref itself still triggers `TS2589`                            | Replace only that hot ref with a fixed, typed `makeFunctionReference("module:function")` constant | the hotspot file only                   | Avoids broad weakening of the entire module                   |
| Convex React hook tuple typing still needs help                             | Keep a tiny adapter-local helper/cast in the surface adapter                                      | adapter file only                       | Localizes the last unavoidable boundary                       |

## Non-Negotiable Rules

### 1. Do not import `convex/react` in runtime or feature UI files

Use the surface adapter layer instead:

- web: `apps/web/src/lib/convex/hooks.ts`
- widget: `apps/widget/src/lib/convex/hooks.ts`
- mobile: follow the same local-wrapper pattern; do not add new direct screen/context-level `convex/react` usage

Direct `convex/react` imports are only acceptable in:

- explicit adapter files
- bootstrap/provider wiring
- targeted tests that intentionally mock the adapter boundary

The current hardening guards freeze these boundaries:

- `apps/web/src/app/typeHardeningGuard.test.ts`
- `apps/widget/src/test/refHardeningGuard.test.ts`
- `apps/mobile/src/typeHardeningGuard.test.ts`
- `packages/react-native-sdk/tests/hookBoundaryGuard.test.ts`

### 2. Do not create refs inside React components or hooks

Bad:

```ts
function WidgetPane() {
  const listRef = makeFunctionReference<"query", Args, Result>("messages:list");
  const data = useQuery(listRef, args);
}
```

Good:

```ts
const LIST_REF = widgetQueryRef<Args, Result>("messages:list");

function WidgetPane() {
  const data = useWidgetQuery(LIST_REF, args);
}
```

All refs must be module-scope constants.

### 3. Do not add new generic string-ref factories

Do not introduce helpers like:

- `getQueryRef(name: string)`
- `getMutationRef(name: string)`
- `getActionRef(name: string)`

Those patterns weaken the type boundary and make review harder. Some older code still has them, but they are legacy, not the standard for new work.

Use named fixed refs instead:

```ts
const LIST_MESSAGES_REF = webQueryRef<ListMessagesArgs, MessageRecord[]>("messages:list");
const SEND_MESSAGE_REF = webMutationRef<SendMessageArgs, Id<"messages">>("messages:send");
```

### 4. Keep casts local, named, and justified

Allowed:

- a tiny adapter-local cast needed to satisfy a Convex hook tuple type
- a hotspot-local shallow helper for `ctx.runQuery`, `ctx.runMutation`, `ctx.runAction`, or `ctx.scheduler.runAfter`
- a hotspot-local typed `makeFunctionReference("module:function")` when generated refs trigger `TS2589`

Not allowed for new code:

- `as any`
- broad `unsafeApi` / `unsafeInternal` object aliases in runtime code
- repeated `as unknown as` across multiple call sites
- hiding transport typing inside UI/controller modules

### 5. Update guard tests when you add or move a boundary

If you intentionally add a new approved boundary, document it in the relevant guard test at the same time.

## Standard Patterns

## A. Defining a new Convex query or mutation

Default backend pattern:

```ts
import { query, mutation } from "./_generated/server";
import { v } from "convex/values";
import type { Id } from "./_generated/dataModel";

type VisitorSummary = {
  _id: Id<"visitors">;
  name?: string;
  email?: string;
};

export const listByWorkspace = query({
  args: {
    workspaceId: v.id("workspaces"),
  },
  handler: async (ctx, args): Promise<VisitorSummary[]> => {
    const visitors = await ctx.db
      .query("visitors")
      .withIndex("by_workspace", (q) => q.eq("workspaceId", args.workspaceId))
      .collect();

    return visitors.map((visitor) => ({
      _id: visitor._id,
      name: visitor.name,
      email: visitor.email,
    }));
  },
});
```

Rules:

- Use narrow `v.*` validators.
- Prefer explicit local return types for shared, frontend-facing, or cross-function contracts.
- Convert untyped or broad data to a narrow shape before returning it.
- If you need `v.any()`, document it in `security/convex-v-any-arg-exceptions.json`.

## B. Consuming Convex from web or widget code

Runtime/UI files should consume feature-local wrappers or fixed refs through the local adapter.

Widget example:

```ts
import type { Id } from "@opencom/convex/dataModel";
import { useWidgetQuery, widgetQueryRef } from "../lib/convex/hooks";

type TicketRecord = {
  _id: Id<"tickets">;
  subject: string;
};

const VISITOR_TICKETS_REF = widgetQueryRef<
  { workspaceId: Id<"workspaces">; visitorId: Id<"visitors">; sessionToken: string },
  TicketRecord[]
>("tickets:listByVisitor");

export function useVisitorTickets(
  workspaceId: Id<"workspaces"> | undefined,
  visitorId: Id<"visitors"> | null,
  sessionToken: string | null
) {
  return useWidgetQuery(
    VISITOR_TICKETS_REF,
    workspaceId && visitorId && sessionToken ? { workspaceId, visitorId, sessionToken } : "skip"
  );
}
```

Use the same structure in web with `webQueryRef`, `webMutationRef`, `webActionRef`, `useWebQuery`, `useWebMutation`, and `useWebAction`.

Rules:

- Define refs once at module scope.
- Keep `skip` / gating logic in the wrapper where practical.
- Export narrow feature-local result types instead of leaking giant inferred shapes.
- Do not import `convex/react` directly in feature components, screens, contexts, or controller hooks.

## C. Calling one Convex function from another

### Preferred default: generated refs

Start here when the types are normal:

```ts
import { internal } from "./_generated/api";

await ctx.runMutation(internal.notifications.deliver, {
  conversationId,
});
```

This is the standard path until it hits a real `TS2589` problem.

### TS2589 fallback: shallow helper first

If `ctx.runQuery(...)`, `ctx.runMutation(...)`, `ctx.runAction(...)`, or `ctx.scheduler.runAfter(...)` causes deep-instantiation errors, add a local helper:

```ts
import { type FunctionReference } from "convex/server";

type ConvexRef<
  Type extends "query" | "mutation" | "action",
  Visibility extends "internal" | "public",
  Args extends Record<string, unknown>,
  Return = unknown,
> = FunctionReference<Type, Visibility, Args, Return>;

function getShallowRunMutation(ctx: { runMutation: unknown }) {
  return ctx.runMutation as unknown as <
    Visibility extends "internal" | "public",
    Args extends Record<string, unknown>,
    Return,
  >(
    mutationRef: ConvexRef<"mutation", Visibility, Args, Return>,
    mutationArgs: Args
  ) => Promise<Return>;
}
```

Then call through the helper:

```ts
const runMutation = getShallowRunMutation(ctx);
await runMutation(internal.notifications.deliver, { conversationId });
```

### TS2589 fallback: fixed typed ref when the generated ref itself is the problem

If simply referencing `api.foo.bar` or `internal.foo.bar` still triggers `TS2589`, switch only that hot call site to a fixed typed ref:

```ts
import { makeFunctionReference, type FunctionReference } from "convex/server";

type DeliverArgs = { conversationId: Id<"conversations"> };
type DeliverResult = null;

type ConvexRef<
  Type extends "query" | "mutation" | "action",
  Visibility extends "internal" | "public",
  Args extends Record<string, unknown>,
  Return = unknown,
> = FunctionReference<Type, Visibility, Args, Return>;

const DELIVER_NOTIFICATION_REF = makeFunctionReference<"mutation", DeliverArgs, DeliverResult>(
  "notifications:deliver"
) as unknown as ConvexRef<"mutation", "internal", DeliverArgs, DeliverResult>;
```

Use this only after the generated ref path proved pathological.

## Which approach to choose

### Use generated `api` / `internal` refs when

- the call is backend-to-backend
- the generated ref typechecks normally
- you are not in a known `TS2589` hotspot

### Use fixed typed `makeFunctionReference(...)` constants when

- you are in a surface adapter or feature-local wrapper file
- you need a stable local ref for a frontend wrapper
- a backend hotspot still blows up after trying generated refs

### Use local wrapper hooks when

- the consumer is React UI, runtime, controller, screen, or context code
- the feature needs gating or `skip` behavior
- you want to normalize the result shape once for multiple consumers

### Use a shallow backend helper when

- the problem is `ctx.runQuery` / `ctx.runMutation` / `ctx.runAction` / `runAfter`
- the ref type is okay, but the invocation is too deep

### Use an adapter-local cast only when

- Convex’s React hook typing still needs an exact tuple or helper shape
- the cast can stay in the adapter file and nowhere else

## Current Surface Standards

### Backend (`packages/convex`)

- Default to generated refs.
- Localize `TS2589` workarounds with named `getShallowRun*` helpers.
- If needed, use fixed typed refs at the hotspot only.
- Keep guard coverage in `packages/convex/tests/runtimeTypeHardeningGuard.test.ts`.

### Web (`apps/web`)

- Feature/runtime code should not import `convex/react` directly.
- Use feature-local wrapper hooks and the web adapter in `apps/web/src/lib/convex/hooks.ts`.
- Keep refs at module scope.
- Guard coverage lives in `apps/web/src/app/typeHardeningGuard.test.ts`.

### Widget (`apps/widget`)

- Feature/runtime code should not import `convex/react` directly.
- Use the widget adapter in `apps/widget/src/lib/convex/hooks.ts`.
- The only remaining adapter escape hatch is the query-args tuple helper required by Convex’s hook typing.
- Guard coverage lives in `apps/widget/src/test/refHardeningGuard.test.ts`.

### Mobile (`apps/mobile`)

- Target the same pattern as web/widget: local wrapper hooks plus module-scope typed refs.
- Do not add new direct `convex/react` usage to screens, contexts, or controller-style hooks.
- If a local adapter/wrapper does not exist for the feature yet, create one instead of importing hooks directly into runtime UI.
- Guard coverage lives in `apps/mobile/src/typeHardeningGuard.test.ts`.

## Anti-Patterns To Avoid

- `function getQueryRef(name: string) { ... }`
- `function getMutationRef(name: string) { ... }`
- `function getActionRef(name: string) { ... }`
- component-local `makeFunctionReference(...)`
- `as any`
- broad `unsafeApi` / `unsafeInternal` aliases
- scattering the same `as unknown as` across many call sites
- returning `unknown` or `string` when a branded `Id<"...">` or explicit object type is the real contract

## Verification Checklist

After changing Convex typing boundaries:

1. Run the touched package typecheck first.
2. Run the touched package tests.
3. Run the relevant hardening guard tests.
4. If this work is OpenSpec-driven, run strict OpenSpec validation.

Useful commands:

```bash
pnpm --filter @opencom/convex typecheck
pnpm --filter @opencom/web typecheck
pnpm --filter @opencom/widget typecheck

pnpm --filter @opencom/convex test -- --run tests/runtimeTypeHardeningGuard.test.ts
pnpm --filter @opencom/web test -- --run src/app/typeHardeningGuard.test.ts
pnpm --filter @opencom/widget test -- --run src/test/refHardeningGuard.test.ts
pnpm exec vitest run --config apps/mobile/vitest.config.ts apps/mobile/src/typeHardeningGuard.test.ts
```

## Review Rule of Thumb

If you are about to:

- add a new direct `convex/react` import in feature code
- add a new `get*Ref(name: string)` factory
- add `unsafeApi`, `unsafeInternal`, `as any`, or repeated `as unknown as`
- create a ref inside a React component

stop and use one of the standard patterns above instead.
