# ROS2 Robotic Arm Project

## Goal
Learn ROS2 concepts with a simulated robotic arm + gripper + camera → eventually natural language control ("take the blue cube, put it in the basket"). Simulation-only for next 6+ months.

## Instructions for Claude

**Documentation style — focus on WHY, not HOW:**
- The code is the source of truth for implementation details. Don't describe how things are implemented — document **decisions, constraints, and lessons learned**.
- No code examples in CLAUDE.md. Use `--help` or read the source.
- Keep CLAUDE.md **under 150 lines**. Move session notes to `doc/CHANGELOG.md` after each session.

**Always update this file** when you:
- Make an architectural or design decision
- Fix a non-obvious bug — document root cause and lesson
- Discover a constraint or ROS2/MoveIt quirk

**Also read and update these `doc/` companion files**:
- [`doc/MEMORY.md`](doc/MEMORY.md) — compact patterns and constraints
- [`doc/architecture.md`](doc/architecture.md) — node diagrams, topics, design decisions
- [`doc/CHANGELOG.md`](doc/CHANGELOG.md) — historical session notes

## Quick Reference

**What this is**: ROS2 Jazzy simulation of AR4 6-DOF arm + gripper. Phase 4.5 complete — AR4 switch with pick-and-place working, camera + vision pipeline, 44 integration tests (44/44 passing). No Gazebo, no LLM.

**Quick start**: `./run.sh sim` → launches RViz + MoveIt | `./run.sh tests` → runs integration tests

**Running nodes** (after `./run.sh sim`):
- `motion_server` — persistent action server, holds `ArmController` in memory, subscribes to `/detected_objects`
- `scene_manager` — one-shot, spawns objects from `objects.yaml` into MoveIt
- `move_group` — MoveIt2 planning server
- `arm_controller` / `gripper_controller` / `joint_state_broadcaster` — ros2_control
- `robot_state_publisher` + `rviz2`
- `camera_node` — synthetic top-down camera (Phase 4, working)
- `vision_node` — HSV color detection from pixels (Phase 4, working)

**Entry points**:
- CLI: `ros2 run robotic_arm_bringup arm <command> [args]` (thin action client)
- Actions: `/pick`, `/place`, `/move_to`, `/home`, `/reset`, `/open_gripper`, `/close_gripper`
- Services: `/list_objects`, `/move_object`
- Python: `from robotic_arm_bringup.arm_controller import ArmController`

## Critical Constraints

These have caused bugs. Always remember them.

| Constraint | What breaks if ignored |
|------------|------------------------|
| Always set `start_state` on every MoveGroup plan | Second+ moves plan from home (0,0,0) → wrong trajectories |
| `AttachedCollisionObject` persists across CLI calls | Cube stays glued to arm across commands |
| Detach object before every `return False` in `place()` | Object stays attached after failed place |
| After `_detach_object`, call `_remove_object_from_scene` | MoveIt re-adds object at arm position → START_STATE_IN_COLLISION |
| Always re-add objects with `ObjectColor` after scene removal | Objects reappear green (MoveIt default) |
| MoveIt2 ACM diffs are NOT diffs — any non-empty ACM replaces the whole matrix | Must fetch current ACM, merge, then apply. Otherwise SRDF self-collision allowances wiped → OMPL rejects all states |
| Attach cube with `touch_links` BEFORE `close_gripper()` | Error 99999 (per-plan ACM doesn't work for gripper group) |
| Use `/apply_planning_scene` service (not topic) for attach/detach | `time.sleep()` doesn't spin executor → race condition |
| Mimic joints: no command interface in ros2_control | ros2_control crash on startup |
| Never call `spin_until_future_complete` on a node with an active executor | Deadlock — use `_wait_for_future()` instead |
| Never call `rclpy.spin_once(self)` on a node spun by `rclpy.spin()` | Executor deadlock — use `time.sleep()` polling instead |
| Never block inside a timer/service callback with `time.sleep()` polling | Blocks executor thread → service response callback can't fire → future never completes |
| MoveIt `CollisionObject.primitive_poses` are in object-local frame | World position is in `co.pose`, not `co.primitive_poses[0]` — reading primitive_poses gives (0,0,0) |
| Use `future.add_done_callback()` for async service calls inside callbacks | Non-blocking; executor calls the callback when response arrives — no sleeping needed |
| `place()` must check `_is_object_attached()` before proceeding | Without it, place succeeds on unheld objects — detach/re-add corrupts scene |
| In `place()`, lift BEFORE re-adding object to scene | If lift fails with object in scene → arm stuck in collision → all subsequent motions fail |
| In `place()`, store object at `z` not `release_z` | Each place drops Z by 0.05 → objects drift below reachable workspace after 2+ placements |
| After motion, wait for fresh `/joint_states` before next plan | Stale joint state → MoveIt plans from wrong start → START_STATE_IN_COLLISION |
| Vision callback must use trylock (non-blocking) on `self._lock` | Blocking lock consumes executor threads → MoveGroup result never delivered → 30s timeout on all motions |
| Vision callback must skip held objects (`self._held_objects`) | Camera sees attached objects at arm position → vision moves them to (0,0) → scene corruption |
| Vision callback needs per-object cooldown (2s) after actions | Stale camera frame after pick/place → vision overwrites correct position with pre-action position |

## Current State

- ✓ AR4 6-DOF arm + gripper URDF with MoveIt2 + KDL IK
- ✓ RViz visualization with colored collision objects
- ✓ Importable `ArmController` library (config-driven via `arm_config.yaml`)
- ✓ Persistent `motion_server` action server (7 actions + 2 services)
- ✓ Thin CLI client (sends goals to `motion_server`)
- ✓ Pick-and-place with planning scene updates (ACM fetch-merge pattern)
- ✓ `place` CLI accepts optional target position args
- ✓ YAML-based object config (`objects.yaml`)
- ✓ Cylinder + box shape support in scene
- ✓ Basket (tray) as place target
- ✓ 44 integration tests (error handling, state verification, round-trip, vision) — 44/44 passing
- ✓ Camera + vision pipeline — complete: vision updates scene positions, `move-object` CLI
- ✗ LLM integration (Phase 5)

## Roadmap

- [x] **Phase 1** — CLI motion control, MoveIt2 integration, pick-and-place
- [x] **Phase 2** — Importable `ArmController` library + YAML config + thin CLI
- [x] **Phase 3** — Persistent `motion_server` action server + CLI as action client
- [x] **Phase 4** — Camera + vision pipeline complete
- [x] **Phase 4.5** — Switch to AR4 6-DOF arm. ACM fetch-merge fix, object repositioning, 44/44 tests
- [ ] **Phase 4.6** — Gazebo physics simulation
- [ ] **Phase 5** — LLM interface: `llm_interface_node` + `validator_node` → natural language → motion server actions

## Known Limitations
- AR4 cannot reach z < 0.20 at r > 0.30m (joint limits j2=-42°, j3=-89°)
- Mock hardware: no physics simulation
- Object positions reset to YAML defaults if MoveIt restarts
- MoveIt position tolerance (~1cm) means commanded ≠ actual gripper position

## Latest Session Changes (2026-04-12)

- **ACM bug fixed**: `_allow_object_collisions` now fetches current ACM via `/get_planning_scene`, adds entry, applies merged result. Old approach replaced the entire ACM, wiping SRDF self-collision allowances.
- **`allowed_object` removed** from `_move_to_position()` and `_move_gripper()` — collision allowance handled via persistent scene updates at call site.
- **Objects repositioned**: z raised from 0.10 to 0.20 (AR4 joint limits prevent reaching z=0.12 at r~0.35m).
- **Tests updated**: All 44 tests pass with new AR4 coordinates.
