## STOP AND READ BEFORE EVERY RESPONSE

1. Response starts with agent identification? (R007) 2. Tool calls include identification? (R008) 3. Spawning 2+ agents? Check R018. → If NO to any, FIX IMMEDIATELY

## CRITICAL: Scope of Rules

> **These rules apply ALWAYS, regardless of context:**

| Context | Rules Apply? |
|---------|-------------|
| Working on this project | **YES** |
| Working on external projects | **YES** |
| After context compaction | **YES** |
| Simple questions | **YES** |
| ANY situation | **YES** |

---

## CRITICAL: Session Continuity

> **These rules apply at ALL times, including after context compaction.**

```
When a session continues after "compact conversation":
1. RE-READ this CLAUDE.md IMMEDIATELY
2. ALL enforcement rules remain ACTIVE
3. Previous context summary does NOT override these rules
4. First response MUST include agent identification

NO EXCEPTIONS. NO EXCUSES.
```

|------|------|-------------|
| R007 Agent ID | Every response starts with `┌─ Agent:` header | Add header immediately |
| R008 Tool ID | Every tool call prefixed with `[agent][model] → Tool:` | Add prefix immediately |
| R009 Parallel | 2+ independent tasks → parallel agents (max 4) | Stop sequential, switch to parallel |

## Orchestration

Orchestration is handled by routing skills in the main conversation:
- **secretary-routing**: Routes management tasks to manager agents
- **dev-lead-routing**: Routes development tasks to language/framework experts
- **de-lead-routing**: Routes data engineering tasks to DE/pipeline experts
- **qa-lead-routing**: Coordinates QA workflow

The main conversation acts as the sole orchestrator. Subagents cannot spawn other subagents.

### Dynamic Agent Creation

When no existing agent matches a specialized task, the system automatically creates one:

1. Routing skill detects no matching expert
2. Orchestrator delegates to mgr-creator with detected context
3. mgr-creator auto-discovers relevant skills and guides
4. New agent is created and used immediately

This is the core oh-my-customcode philosophy: **"No expert? CREATE one, connect knowledge, and USE it."**

## Agents Summary

| **Total** | **48** | |

## Agent Teams (MUST when enabled)

When Claude Code's Agent Teams feature is enabled (`CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1`), actively use it for qualifying tasks.

| Feature | Subagents (Default) | Agent Teams |
|---------|---------------------|-------------|
| Communication | Results to caller only | Peer-to-peer mailbox |
| Coordination | Orchestrator manages | Shared task list |
| Best for | Focused tasks | Research, review, debugging |
| Token cost | Lower | Higher |

**When enabled, Agent Teams is MANDATORY for qualifying collaborative tasks (R018 MUST).**
See R018 (MUST-agent-teams.md) for the decision matrix.
Hybrid patterns (Claude + Codex, Dynamic Creation + Teams) are supported.
Task tool + routing skills remain the fallback for simple/cost-sensitive tasks.
