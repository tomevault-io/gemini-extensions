Agent notes for this repo. User-facing usage belongs in `README.md`.

## Active Scope

Keep root-level docs and workflow guidance focused on:

- the static WebUI in `webui/`

Fold durable observations, conclusions, and recovery status into the existing
topic documents under `memory/`. Do not recreate one-file-per-investigation or
dated status snapshots. Generated inventories belong in `reports/`, and
disposable evidence belongs in `scratch/` or `tmp/`.

## Commands

```bat
.\setup_first_time.bat
.\export.bat
.\export.bat --with-assets
.\export.bat --export-from-game
.\build_updates.bat
.\build_updates.bat --init-build
.\build_updates_by_patch.bat --init-baseline
.\build_updates_by_patch.bat --check
.\build_updates_by_patch.bat
.\export_assets.bat
python serve.py
python serve.py 9000
```

Before starting a WebUI server, check whether the default
`http://127.0.0.1:8765/` server is already running. Reuse the existing default
server instead of starting another `serve.py` process on `8765` or a custom
port, unless the user explicitly asks for a second server.

Root wrapper scripts load `endfield_paths.bat` before parsing arguments. That
file sets the repeated local defaults for `ENDFIELD_GAME_ROOT`,
`ENDFIELD_PREVIOUS_EXPORT_ROOT`, and `ENDFIELD_EXPORT_ROOT`; explicit path
flags still override it for one-off commands.

`setup_first_time.bat` is the user-facing all-in-one first-time setup path. It
initializes `tools/AnimeStudio`, builds the AnimeStudio CLI, verifies the
integrated AnimeStudio VFS/audio commands, runs `export.bat --export-from-game`,
prints optional `export_assets.bat --export-from-game` and
`build_updates.bat --init-build` follow-up commands, then starts or reuses the
default WebUI server. Pass `--no-serve` when setup should finish without
starting `serve.py`.

`export.bat` is the canonical Story/Text Tables and curated semantic-view WebUI rebuild from an existing
`export_full/`. It verifies that `export_full/` matches the current installed
`Endfield_Data` fingerprints before the long WebUI builders run, then builds CN
Story/Text Tables data by default. It does not export from installed game data by
default. Pass `--export-from-game` only when the user explicitly asks to refresh
`export_full/` and run the story export tools. Pass `--with-assets` to also
rebuild asset indexes and relink/decode CN audio after generated conversations
are rebuilt. Combining `--export-from-game --with-assets` runs one AnimeStudio
Story+asset export instead of separate Story and asset exporter invocations.
After semantic-view builders and any requested asset/audio work, `export.bat`
rebuilds `reports/source_graph/endfield_source_graph.sqlite` and then builds the
Presentation and Combat views. Presentation emits a stable empty degraded
payload when its graph is missing or older than its generated inputs. The Combat builder refuses graph edges when the database predates
its Gameplay/manifest/asset/AbilityEntity/CharacterTemplate inputs and records a
visible degraded-mode reason instead of treating stale edges as direct.
`export.bat` does not refresh `webui/overrides/story_order.json`; active Story
order is user-managed there, while OCR recovery writes proposed order references
under `webui/data/story_order_ocr.json`. Every `export.bat` run writes a
wall-time and process-tree RAM benchmark under `reports/export/benchmarks/` and updates
`reports/export/export_benchmark_latest.md/json`.
Use `build_updates.bat` for the standalone Updates feed comparison. Use
`build_updates.bat --init-build` for first-time/baseline-only builds where the
Updates feed should be baselined instead of reporting changes. It reads the
previous/current export roots from `endfield_paths.bat` by default, tracks
WebUI-facing exported text JSON plus exported image/model/video assets and
decoded audio, and accepts explicit root flags for one-off comparisons. Pass
`--skip-audio-updates` to omit decoded audio while keeping other asset entries.
Pass `--skip-asset-updates` only for a text-only update feed.
Use `export_assets.bat` for WebUI Assets tab indexes, compact Story media
lookup, and CN audio relinking from existing decoded assets when Story is
already current. Pass `--export-from-game` only when the user explicitly asks to
run the default full AnimeStudio image/model decode, `Material` JSON, and CN
audio decode from installed game data first. Prefer
`export.bat --export-from-game --with-assets` when Story and assets both need an
installed-game refresh. Pass `--webui-assets` for the lean WebUI-referenced
Texture2D mode, or `--debug-assets` for exhaustive AnimeStudio diagnostics.
Use direct `scripts/build_audio.py` runs for non-CN languages or audio-only
maintenance. The audio builder writes shared SFX/music once under
`export_full/structured/Audio/shared/` and language voice under
`export_full/structured/Audio/<LANG>/`, parses Wwise bank event-to-media links, and post-processes generated
conversation JSON with playable `audioSrc` links. The default exporter mode is
`--animestudio-type-job-mode auto`: it merges map-filtered JSON, runs broad Story
JSON types sequentially in isolated processes, and keeps map-filtered asset
conversion sharded; use `parallel` only when comparing concurrent per-type jobs.

Useful direct commands:

```bat
python scripts\build_updates.py
python scripts\build_updates.py --baseline-only
python scripts\build_updates.py --skip-asset-updates
python scripts\build_updates.py --skip-audio-updates
python scripts\build_updates.py --refresh-previous-export-baseline
python scripts\verify_export_freshness.py
python scripts\story_builder\refresh_evidence.py
python scripts\story_builder\source_links.py
python scripts\story_builder\build.py --languages CN --default-language CN
python scripts\story_builder\build.py --languages CN EN JP --default-language CN
python scripts\build_mission_pipeline_data.py
python scripts\build_gameplay_data.py
python scripts\build_progression_data.py
python scripts\build_projectile_data.py
python scripts\build_combat_relationships.py --languages CN
python scripts\build_economy_data.py --languages CN --default-language CN
python scripts\build_world_data.py --languages CN --default-language CN
python scripts\build_presentation_data.py --languages CN
python scripts\story_recovery\build_option_override_coverage_audit.py --language CN
python scripts\build_assets.py
python scripts\build_audio.py
python scripts\download_bilibili_video.py --dry-run
python scripts\pack_webui.py
```

`scripts/story_builder/build.py` currently takes about 3 minutes for the
default CN lean build on this checkout. Multi-language builds or forced
timeline recovery can take longer; when Codex runs this command directly, use a
longer shell timeout, such as 10-15 minutes (`timeout_ms` of at least
`900000`).

Unity character recovery lab:

```bat
cd unity_endfield_graph_shader_lab
.\open_character_recovery_lab.bat
.\build_all_character_recovery.bat
```

The Python tooling is intended to stay stdlib-only unless a task explicitly
requires otherwise.

## WebUI Technical Notes

Keep detailed browser/export mechanics here, in project skills, or in
`scripts/README.md`; keep the root `README.md` short and user-facing.

Browser behavior:

- Story/Text Tables inline media treats `sns_emoji_*` as regular inline emoji
  with no popup/modal preview.
- Non-emoji SNS media such as `sns_image_*` and `sns_sticker_*` render at
  normal image proportions with bounded hover/modal previews.
- Story recovery issue and method filters stay visible in every mode.
  Source/debug blocks, mission timeline evidence, cutscene debug panels, and
  manual order-edit controls are behind `Show debug info`.
- The Story reset button returns filters to Story sort while preserving
  expanded mission groups.
- Normal semantic navigation exposes Gameplay. Mission Pipeline, Progression, Combat & Projectiles,
  the retained standalone Combat graph, Factory, World, and Presentation are
  deferred and hidden unless `Show debug info` is enabled; disabling debug while
  one is active must normalize to a visible page and URL.
- Combat & Projectiles groups records by evidence-backed character/enemy sender
  and must label identifier-only ownership as inferred. World groups by authored
  level IDs and may plot X/Z positions, but rows without an exported level ID
  must remain unassigned rather than being inferred from coordinates.

Export freshness:

- `export.bat` runs `scripts/verify_export_freshness.py` before rebuilding
  from an existing `export_full/`.
- Run `python scripts\verify_export_freshness.py` directly when checking the
  guard, and pass `--game-root "...\Endfield_Data"` for non-default installs.
- If freshness reports stale source roots, rerun
  `.\export.bat --export-from-game` before Story or asset builders read
  `export_full/`.

Setup and export internals:

- The expected AnimeStudio CLI path is
  `tools\AnimeStudio\AnimeStudio.CLI\bin\Release\net9.0-windows\AnimeStudio.CLI.exe`.
- The AnimeStudio CLI provides the WebUI VFS commands `dump`, `audio`, `stream`,
  `vfs-index`, and `list`; `dump`, `audio`, `stream`, and `vfs-index` help should include
  `--fallback-assets <FALLBACK_ASSETS>`. `dump`, `stream`, and `vfs-index` accept repeated
  `--block-type` flags plus repeated `--file-regex` filters; `stream` exposes the
  same targeted VFS filtering for JSONL byte streaming.
- Installed-game Story exports use `--structured-dump-mode webui` by default:
  they dump only WebUI-consumed VFS blocks (`table`, `json-data`, and video)
  and skip raw asset bundles, audio PCK/media files, world-streaming bytes,
  irradiance volumes, extend-data bins, patch bytes, and Lua. `build_audio.py`
  streams Wwise bank metadata directly from VFS when relinking audio events.
  `--structured-dump-mode full` keeps the same production skip rules; use
  `--structured-dump-mode debug` only for broad VFS diagnostics.
- `export_assets.bat --export-from-game` passes `--skip-structured`, writes a
  lightweight VFS metadata index, runs WebUI-facing image/model/Material
  export, and decodes CN audio before relinking.
- `export.bat --export-from-game --with-assets` keeps the structured Story
  refresh and folds the asset export into the same AnimeStudio run.
- `tools\DummyDll` is the preferred repo-local IL2CPP DummyDll root when
  optional script-schema recovery is wanted. Wrapper flags or
  `ANIMESTUDIO_DUMMY_DLLS` can supply it, but missing or stale DummyDll paths
  must warn and continue without failing normal exports.
- `--animestudio-mono-behaviour-type-tree-priority script-first` is for
  targeted MonoBehaviour schema experiments; the default is `serialized-first`.
  Script-first must fall back cleanly when no usable DummyDlls are available.
- After installed-game refreshes, check `reports/export/export_full_summary.md` for
  stage return codes and AnimeStudio export errors.

Browser data inputs and outputs:

- Active inputs include `export_full/structured/StreamingAssets/Table/*.json`,
  recovered AnimeStudio text/metadata under `export_full/recovered/`,
  exported image/model/material outputs under
  `export_full/recovered/AnimeStudio-cli/<source>/`, and generated data under
  `webui/data/`.
- Generated browser outputs include `webui/data/manifest.json`,
  `webui/data/lang/<code>/index.json`, `conv/*.json`, `mission/*.json`,
  `reference/**`, `webui/data/mission_pipeline/index.json`,
  `webui/data/mission_pipeline/missions/*.json`, `webui/data/gameplay/projectiles.json`,
  `webui/data/lang/<code>/progression/index.json`,
  `webui/data/lang/<code>/gameplay/combat_relationships.json`,
  `webui/data/lang/<code>/economy/index.json`,
  `webui/data/lang/<code>/world/index.json`,
  `webui/data/lang/<code>/presentation/index.json`,
  `webui/data/assets/index.json`, and
  `webui/data/updates/latest.json`.
- The current `export.bat` skips raw VFS output and source inventory because
  the browser does not need them.

Tool pointers:

- `tools/AnimeStudio/` is the tracked AnimeStudio fork submodule used by
  installed-game Story and asset export paths.
- `tools/endfield_source_graph.py` builds/query local SQLite evidence across
  generated WebUI story/text-table data, selected tables, audio, videos,
  assets, material links, and optional AnimeStudio asset maps.
- `tools/endfield-il2cpp/` contains offline IL2CPP metadata diagnostics. It is
  not part of normal export, Updates, packaging, or serving flows.
- Optional local vendor/tool caches may live under ignored `tools/`; keep their
  generated outputs local.

Script notes:

- `scripts/README.md` lists the maintained script map and workflow contracts.
- New one-off exploration scripts should start in `scratch/` or `tmp/`.
- Durable conclusions belong in the matching consolidated `memory/` topic;
  reusable helpers should move into maintained workflow code only with
  matching docs and intentional tracking.

## Memory Maintenance Rule

`memory/` is intentionally flat and limited to the topic files indexed by
`memory/README.md`. Treat those files as living sources of truth:

- update the current conclusion, evidence boundary, commands, and recovery
  queue in the owning topic;
- fold useful session history into concise evidence notes instead of adding a
  dated Markdown file;
- keep changing counts, exhaustive inventories, and generated audits in
  `reports/`, with links from memory only when they remain useful;
- keep disposable probes and intermediate output in `scratch/` or `tmp/`;
- add a new memory file only for a genuinely new durable topic, and update
  `memory/README.md`, this guidance list, and relevant active docs together.

The owning topics are WebUI, Story recovery, game-data recovery, semantic asset
recovery, AnimeStudio exporter recovery, and character render/animation
recovery. Cross-topic improvement plans should be split into the recovery
queues of those owning files rather than maintained as a second status source.

## Current Guidance Locations

The former exploration archive has been consolidated. Do not recreate duplicate
README-shaped or dated snapshots; update the current source of truth instead:

- user-facing active workflow: `README.md`
- agent-facing repo rules: `AGENTS.md`
- script/workflow contract: `scripts/README.md`
- WebUI frontend scope: `webui/README.md`
- memory topic index and writing rules: `memory/README.md`
- detailed WebUI recovery notes: `memory/webui_recovery.md`
- Story reconstruction conclusions: `memory/game_story_recovery.md`
- game-data formats, semantics, and source graph: `memory/game_data_recovery.md`
- semantic asset/entity recovery: `memory/asset_recovery.md`
- AnimeStudio exporter recovery: `memory/animestudio_recovery.md`
- character render/animation recovery: `memory/character_render_and_animation_recovery.md`

## Project Local Skills

Project-only Codex skills live under `.codex/skills/`. When a task matches one
of these workflows, open the matching `SKILL.md` before acting:

- `.codex/skills/endfield-webui-workflow/`: WebUI refresh, serving, packaging,
  Updates tab, and static frontend scope, including current SNS inline-image
  behavior.
- `.codex/skills/endfield-source-graph/`: source graph build/query and
  graph-backed follow-up reports.
- `.codex/skills/endfield-option-overrides/`: editing and validating
  WebUI-only manual option recovery overrides in
  `webui/overrides/options.json`.
- `.codex/skills/animestudio-workflow/`: building, running, patching, and
  debugging the local `tools/AnimeStudio` exporter and its WebUI wrappers.

The current checkout does not ship separate `endfield-story-recovery` or
`endfield-character-recovery-lab` skill folders. For those workflows, use the
active docs (`README.md`, `scripts/README.md`, `webui/README.md`, and
`unity_endfield_graph_shader_lab/README.md`) plus the existing source-graph
skill when graph evidence is relevant.

The retired exploration snapshots were collapsed because they mixed active
workflow guidance with stale conclusions and repeated generated-report status.
Keep generated reports in `reports/`, concise durable conclusions in the six
owning memory topics, and disposable experiments in `scratch/` or `tmp/`.

## Update Tracking Rule

The WebUI Updates tab must report only exported game-data changes between a
saved previous export and the current export. By default it tracks the
exported JSON roots that feed Story/Text Tables display plus exported
image/model/video assets plus decoded audio. Use `--full-export-scan` only for
a broad audit of all files under the two export roots.

`build_updates.bat` reads the saved previous export and current export roots
from `endfield_paths.bat` (`ENDFIELD_PREVIOUS_EXPORT_ROOT` and
`ENDFIELD_EXPORT_ROOT`). The underlying `scripts/build_updates.py` defaults to
comparing:

```text
export_1d2
export_full
```

when no wrapper config or explicit flags are supplied. Pass
`--previous-export-root PATH` for a one-off different saved previous export.
The direct two-extraction command that also generates the WebUI page is:

```bat
.\build_updates.bat --previous-export-root OLD --export-root NEW --refresh-previous-export-baseline
```

`OLD` is the saved extracted version and `NEW` is the current extracted
version. `build_updates_by_patch.bat --check` is detection-only; the default
no-argument patch mode invokes the extracted-tree feed comparison itself after
successful staging and rotation.
Scanner cache and feed history live under `.game-data-tracker/`; the cached
baseline is built from the previous export folder, then the current export root
is scanned against it using the same focused roots. Do not point this
comparison at `webui/`, `reports/`, `memory/`, or `scratch/`. WebUI edits and
generated output outside the export roots must not appear as game-data updates.

`build_updates_by_patch.bat` is the original installed-data patch workflow.
`--init-baseline` builds a logical VFS snapshot from only the current installed
version and attaches it under the current export without requiring a previous
export. Use `build_updates.bat --init-build` separately when an empty first
WebUI feed is desired. `--check` is detection-only. With no mode, the wrapper
runs `--apply`: logical no-change, version-only, and chunk-only repack results
leave all published state untouched; logical changes clone the complete current
export into sibling staging, selectively dump changed Table/JsonData/Video/
AuditVideo/Lua files, refresh broad AnimeStudio or CN audio scopes only when
their source blocks changed, re-scan the installed VFS, and then publish.

Patch publication moves the previous `export_full` to the configured previous
export path, using a snapshot-suffixed sibling if that path already exists,
renames staging to the canonical `export_full`, rebuilds WebUI data, invokes
`build_updates.bat` against archive/current, and advances the baseline only
after all required work succeeds. On a post-rotation failure it restores the
previous export and WebUI data and retains the failed new tree under
`.game-data-tracker/original-data/failed/`. The current and archive roots must
be on the same volume. A transaction journal under the operational root blocks
new runs if an interrupted publication needs inspection.

The builder scans exported assets in the same two export folders by default to
add image/model/video/audio asset-level entries to the Updates page. Asset
modifications use fast size fingerprints by default; pass
`--hash-asset-updates` only when same-size binary modifications must be
detected. Use `--skip-audio-updates` when decoded audio entries should be
omitted while image/model/video entries remain enabled. Use
`--skip-asset-updates` only when all asset entries should be omitted.
Use `--dry-run-prune-previous-export-untracked` to preview previous-export
files that exist byte-identically at the same relative paths in the current
export, and `--prune-previous-export-untracked` only when intentionally
deleting those old duplicate copies from the previous export folder. This
pruning must never target `export_full/` or the repo root.

Use `--baseline-only` only when an empty feed is intentional. Use
`--refresh-previous-export-baseline` after replacing the saved previous export
folder so the cached scanner baseline is rebuilt.

## Repo Rules

- Prefer the layout rooted at `serve.py`, `export.bat`, `webui/`,
  `scripts/`, and `unity_endfield_graph_shader_lab/`.
- Keep `README.md` focused on active WebUI user-facing usage.
- Fold durable observations and conclusions into the matching consolidated
  `memory/` topic; do not add per-session or dated status files.
- Keep `reports/` for durable generated reports only, not agent conclusions or
  narrative writeups.
- Keep routine reports grouped by topic: exporter summaries, run logs, and
  benchmarks under `reports/export/`; Story build summaries under
  `reports/story/build/`; manual Story recovery evidence under
  `reports/story/recovery/`; update summaries under `reports/updates/`; and
  asset diagnostics under `reports/assets/`. Do not add loose report files at
  the `reports/` root.
- Keep the roots of `scratch/` and `tmp/` free of loose files and one-off run
  directories. Write experiments as `scratch/<topic>/<task>/` and disposable
  intermediates as `tmp/<topic>/<task-or-run>/`. Prefer the active topic names
  `webui`, `story`, `assets`, `animestudio`, `source_graph`,
  `character_recovery`, `game_data`, `updates`, `ocr`, and
  `reverse_engineering`; use `tests`, `tools`, or `misc` only when needed.
- Use `scratch/` for attempts, tool prototypes, and generated previews that may
  be revisited. Promote reusable helpers to maintained code or delete stale
  experiments.
- Use `tmp/` for disposable results and intermediates. Remove completed run
  directories after validation, and never cite `tmp/` as durable evidence.
- For self-contained `ue5_*` or `unity_*` projects, prefer that project's own
  scratch/temp area instead of the repo-root work directories.
- Put durable shared helper code under the maintained script/tool surface.
  `tools/` is ignored by default except for already tracked helper scripts, so
  new promoted tools need intentional tracking and documentation.
- Local vendor/tool caches may live under ignored `tools/`. If
  `tools/Ruri.ShaderDecompiler` is present, regularly pull upstream before
  rebuild or recovery work: `git -C tools\Ruri.ShaderDecompiler pull --ff-only`.
- Keep `ue5_*` and `unity_*` directories self-contained. Code, assets, generated
  files, and helpers related to those projects should live inside the matching
  project folder.
- Preserve narrow, surgical changes when adjusting exporters or builders.
- Do not promote an ad-hoc script into `scripts/` unless it supports WebUI or
  `unity_endfield_graph_shader_lab`.

## Active Script Groups

WebUI:

- `scripts/export_full_from_game.py`
- `scripts/track_export_changes.py`
- `scripts/story_builder/dialog_registry.py`
- `scripts/story_builder/video_bindings.py`
- `scripts/verify_export_freshness.py`
- `scripts/story_builder/refresh_evidence.py`
- `scripts/build_updates.py`
- `scripts/story_builder/source_links.py`
- `scripts/story_builder/build.py`
- `scripts/story_builder/timeline_action_evidence.py`
- `scripts/build_gameplay_data.py`
- `scripts/build_mission_pipeline_data.py`
- `scripts/build_progression_data.py`
- `scripts/build_projectile_data.py`
- `scripts/build_combat_relationships.py`
- `scripts/build_economy_data.py`
- `scripts/build_world_data.py`
- `scripts/build_presentation_data.py`
- `scripts/build_assets.py`
- legacy local index helpers `scripts/build_data_index.py` and
  `scripts/build_decoded_index.py` are not active WebUI pages
- `scripts/build_audio.py`
- `scripts/pack_webui.py`
- supporting files in `scripts/` and `scripts/asset_builder/`

Story reconstruction helpers used by WebUI builders:

- `scripts/story_builder/timeline_recovery.py`
- `scripts/story_builder/timeline_action_evidence.py`
- `scripts/story_builder/mission_recovery.py`
- `scripts/scene_order_gap_shared.py`

Story recovery audit/refresh tools, not run by `export.bat`:

- `scripts/story_recovery/`
- `scripts/download_bilibili_video.py` is an optional gameplay-video intake
  helper for the OCR/audio story-order workflow. It requires `requests`,
  `ffmpeg`, and browser-exported Bilibili cookies, writes complete `.mp4` files
  under `videos/`, and is not part of the stdlib-only export path.

Unity character recovery lab:

- project-local scripts under `unity_endfield_graph_shader_lab/`

The old archived-script bucket has been retired. Do not recreate it; put
disposable scripts in `scratch/` or `tmp/`, and promote only maintained
workflow code.
