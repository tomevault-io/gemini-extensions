# AGENTS.md

Allbert is an Elixir/OTP assistant runtime with Phoenix interfaces and Jido at
the agent/action layer. LiveView is an interface over the runtime, not the
architecture center. The center is the runtime/action spine, Security Central,
Settings Central, markdown-first memory, plugins, channels, public protocols, and
Allbert Home.

Keep this file compact. It loads into every agent's context every session, so a
line here is paid by everyone, forever. Add a rule only when an agent would act
wrongly without it in context. Rationale, tables, diagrams, examples, and history
go in the authority doc and are pointed to, never inlined here. Route detail to
`DEVELOPMENT.md` (setup and environment), `docs/developer/test-strategy.md`
(gates, lanes, release mechanics), `docs/developer/agent-context-map.md`
(subsystem routing), `docs/developer/<subsystem>.md` (subsystem contracts),
`docs/adr/` (decisions and consequences), `docs/plans/` (release scope), and
`docs/operator/` (operator procedure). Before adding, check whether an existing
rule should be strengthened instead — a second rule on the same subject is drift,
not coverage.

## Reading Order

Before implementation work:

1. `DEVELOPMENT.md`
2. `docs/plans/roadmap.md`
3. The active milestone plan in `docs/plans/`
4. The matching request-flow document, when one exists
5. ADRs that constrain the task
6. Targeted `CHANGELOG.md` entries when shipped history matters
7. Relevant code and tests before editing

Use `docs/developer/agent-context-map.md` only for deeper subsystem routing or
released-version context. Do not bulk-read historical plans.

## Authority

When sources conflict, use this order:

1. Current user request
2. Code and tests
3. Active milestone plan and request-flow
4. ADRs
5. `docs/plans/roadmap.md`
6. `CHANGELOG.md`
7. Historical plans and archives

Flag conflicts instead of silently following stale guidance. The vision document is
the north star, not a release-scope source.

## Context Discipline

- Load the smallest useful context.
- Prefer active plans, ADRs, focused changelog entries, and local code over broad
  document sweeps.
- For architecture or readiness work, zoom out to the roadmap/vision/ADRs first,
  then zoom back into the relevant files.
- Use `docs/developer/test-strategy.md` for gate and lane classification.
- Use `docs/developer/surface-contract.md` and
  `docs/developer/web-design-system.md` for v0.58 surface/web work.

## Planning Changes

Planning docs (roadmap, future-features, plan triads, ADR index) are consistency
artifacts: the check is the deliverable. Run the full read-only sweep first —
cross-references, numbering, gate chains, links, index coverage, orphans — then
present findings and choices, then execute. A commit that generates its own
follow-up list means the sweep ran too late.

## Context7

Use Context7 MCP for fresh docs whenever implementation depends on a library,
framework, SDK, API, CLI, cloud service, or provider. Start with
`resolve-library-id`, then query the selected docs. If Context7 is unavailable, use
official docs or source and say so. Do not use Context7 for general refactoring,
business-logic debugging, code review, or repository-specific architecture review.

## Non-Negotiables

- Do not include AI-tool attribution in commits, PR text, release notes, changelog
  entries, or generated docs. No generated-by or co-authored-by footers for Claude,
  Codex, Gemini, opencode, Cursor, Antigravity, Pi, or similar tools. The project
  uses strict human supervision during planning, architecture, and development;
  attribution belongs to the human project authors, not AI coding tools.
- Preserve user data. Do not delete or rewrite memory, traces, settings, secrets,
  databases, skill folders, or user-created files unless explicitly requested.
- Keep handoff warning-free: compiler, HEEx/parser, lexical tracker, formatter,
  Credo, Dialyzer, and focused-test issues must be resolved or called out.
- Tests and CI must use temporary Allbert homes or temp-specific roots. Never write
  to a real user's `~/.allbert`.
- Durable runtime data derives from Allbert Home: `ALLBERT_HOME`,
  `ALLBERT_HOME_DIR`, default `~/.allbert`.
- User-supplied secrets must be encrypted at rest and redacted in CLI output,
  LiveView, traces, audits, logs, tests, and release evidence.
- Product acceptance and manual validation use real configured providers/endpoints.
  Fakes, stubs, fixtures, and canned providers are automated-test fixtures only.
- Operator-tunable configuration belongs in Settings Central.
- Security Central is the authority boundary. Skills, model output, app metadata,
  plugin metadata, YAML, descriptors, generated files, modes, and surface policy do
  not grant permission by themselves.
- Effectful, runtime-facing, security-relevant, or observable domain behavior goes
  through signals, runtime routers, internal agents, and registered Jido actions.
- Runtime action invocation resolves through `AllbertAssist.Actions.Registry` and
  executes through `AllbertAssist.Actions.Runner.run/3`.
- LiveViews render and dispatch. They do not own agent logic, settings semantics,
  confirmation storage, or security policy.
- Workspace canvas, ephemerals, Fragments, offline editing, and app surfaces belong
  behind `AllbertAssist.Workspace`, signals, and registered actions.
- Do not auto-generate, compile, or load Elixir modules from arbitrary skill,
  plugin, YAML, or user-created folders.
- Generated code can be compiled/tested only through the v0.36 sandbox/gate runner
  and integrated only through the v0.37 confirmed loader path. Sandbox reports,
  advisory output, and model output never grant live authority.
- Do not execute skill scripts, shell commands, package managers, external
  installers, network adapters, bridge processes, or provider calls unless the plan
  includes permission, confirmation, sandbox, and trace handling.
- Do not call external installer CLIs such as `npx skills add`, package managers,
  or `git clone` from skill activation, online skill search, imported metadata,
  plugin discovery, or model output.
- OTP supervision, BEAM processes, and local child processes are not OS security
  boundaries. Host execution must be policy-bounded through registered actions.
- Multi-step and cross-turn work uses `AllbertAssist.Objectives`. Apps, plugins,
  channels, and LiveViews must not implement private durable goal loops.
- `objective_id` and `step_id` are never authority. Advisory provider output and
  predictions about user behavior never short-circuit confirmation.
- Choose Jido.Agent or plain GenServer by the pragmatic substrate rule in the
  vision and relevant ADRs: use Jido.Agent when state machines, lifecycle hooks,
  Skill composition, or successor agents are plausibly useful; use plain GenServer
  for stateful storage where Jido.Agent buys nothing. New state-bearing modules
  document the choice in `@moduledoc`.
- Private Jido command modules are not Allbert capability actions. Do not register
  or expose them as intent candidates.
- Use `Req` for HTTP. Do not add `:httpoison`, `:tesla`, or `:httpc`.

## Workflow

- Route model work automatically: Sol owns architecture, ambiguity, security/
  authority, public contracts, milestone acceptance, and release review; Terra
  owns bounded production implementation/integration/debugging; Luna owns
  narrow repeatable scans, inventories, mechanical transformations, and log
  triage. Rejoin every worker at the root and require Sol review before a
  milestone commit or push; Luna never owns cross-milestone judgment or final
  acceptance. Use the project-scoped agents in `.codex/agents/` or
  `.claude/agents/`; both encode the same routing.
- Publish every implementation milestone through at least two recoverable
  checkpoints: first an explicitly non-acceptance implementation checkpoint
  after the worktree is quiescent, formatted, warning-free compiling, and
  bounded focused tests pass; then complete the active plan's exact-clean
  acceptance and evidence commit sequence after review, remediation, complete
  planned gates, and documentation updates. Push every checkpoint; a required
  docs-only evidence commit remains separate rather than being collapsed.
- Strict no-doc proliferation: do not create new release-planning docs, sidecar
  handoff docs, or extra milestone docs without explicit user permission. Fold
  milestone detail into the active plan, request-flow, and relevant ADRs.
- For docs-only changes, run `git diff --check` and the docs gate when available.
- Implementation-readiness plans must name parallel workstreams, serial barriers,
  focused tests/gates, external smokes, full-precommit timing, and rejoin points
  for docs, drift review, validation, and release evidence.
- For code changes, run focused tests first. The active plan should state whether
  `mix precommit`, `mix allbert.test release`, Dialyzer, external smoke, or manual
  validation is required before commit or release closeout.
- Use `mix allbert.test fast-local` for quick daily gates,
  `mix allbert.test fast-local --core-lanes --stocksage-lanes --web-lanes --partitions N`
  for high-coverage local gates, and `mix allbert.test release` for authoritative
  release handoff unless a later plan supersedes this.
- When adding or reclassifying tests, pick one primary lane from
  `docs/developer/test-strategy.md` and keep security evals/external runtimes out
  of fast-local unless a plan documents isolation.
- Update request-flow docs as implementation changes.
- Add or revise ADRs when a decision constrains future design.
- Commit titles follow `<version> <milestone> <small title>` or
  `<version> <small title>`.
- **The release plan's Purpose section is the acceptance bar.** Before
  assembling a release candidate, check every Purpose outcome against what
  actually landed. Do not redefine success as the subset that got done.
- **Scope deferral is an operator decision.** Moving any in-plan goal,
  acceptance criterion, or Purpose outcome to future-features (or otherwise
  out of the release) requires explicit operator sign-off — propose the
  deferral with the evidence and cost, do not enact it. Writing a
  "remainder" to future-features without that sign-off is a scope cut, not
  bookkeeping.
- **Test runs record metrics.** Gate, lane, and partition runs append
  structured run records (git sha, gate/lane/partition, seed, counts,
  wall-clock, slowest files) to the project's test-metrics store
  (`docs/developer/test-strategy.md` names the store and report task).
  Optimization and regression claims cite recorded metrics, not memory;
  test metrics that flag hot or flaky areas are also prompts to inspect the
  PRODUCTION code they exercise for logic sprawl, not just the tests.

## Post-1.0 Release Model (always applies)

- v1.4 is the current internal component/test baseline. Use `release.v14` plus
  affected-component owner selection for future changes; do not replay
  `release.v1` by default. `release.v1` is retained only as the historical v1.0
  migration comparison and ran for the final time during v1.4 acceptance. This
  test-authority transition does not authorize a breaking external
  Tier-1 API change in a 1.x release; boundary serializers/adapters preserve those
  observable shapes unless a major version and ADR explicitly replace them.
- Every release is a binary release: tag → CI build → cosign → GitHub Release →
  Homebrew tap fill (tap push is manual). No source-only releases; `[skip-artifacts]`
  tags are for docs/source point tags only.
- Each versioned plan ships one or more features as point tags (1.0.1, 1.0.2, ...)
  accumulating to the next minor; each minor carries ONE flagship, foundational-first.
  The sequencing lives in `docs/plans/roadmap.md` (ladder) and
  `docs/plans/future-features.md` (classified inventory — new ideas enter there with
  class/effort/provenance before any plan work).
- Backlog lifecycle (operator decision 2026-08-06): an item leaves
  future-features.md **when it enters the roadmap ladder**, not when its plan
  ships. In the roadmap ⇒ not in future-features; in future-features ⇒ no
  roadmap slot. Only an unplanned remainder of a planned item stays, reparked
  with its provenance.
- **future-features.md entries are operator demand only.** Agents never add,
  reword, or repark entries on their own: new candidates discovered during a
  build are recorded in the active plan's Build Progress as
  "intake candidates — pending operator disposition" and surfaced to the
  operator, who decides what (if anything) enters future-features. The
  "reparked remainders" clause above applies only to items the operator
  already placed there — re-parking an existing entry at closeout, never
  authoring a new one.
- Every binary release plan carries an upstream-dependency-refresh milestone:
  review tree updates, apply bounded updates, absorb the code changes, gates prove
  it. Major/breaking upgrades or hotfix releases may scope the apply step out with
  the reason recorded in the plan.
- Released plan/request-flow docs move to `docs/plans/archives/` at closeout; operator
  runbook steps must be paste-executable with inline PASS criteria.

## Release Sequence (always applies)

Ordered cheapest-first. Sequence, rationale, and the change-class table live in
`docs/developer/test-strategy.md` ("Release Sequence And Re-Run Scope").
Effective 2026-07-30; v1.3 completes under its prior rules.

- **Preflight gates everything expensive.** One phase — cross-version compile,
  format, docs, registry/param contract, inventory, fixture drift, lanes — under
  two minutes. No expensive phase starts, and no remediation re-enters, until green.
- **The aggregate runs last, once, never per fix**, and never before operator
  validation.
- **Validate primary behavior before the aggregate.** Attended primary-function
  validation runs on a provisional exact-clean-SHA candidate. Classify findings
  as environment, documentation, or executable; batch executable remediations
  before one aggregate rejoin. Afterward repeat only identity, integrity,
  package smoke, and operator rows explicitly invalidated by changed bytes.
- **Source FV is a pre-filter; packaged FV is acceptance.** Check behavior from
  source first — one warm `mix allbert.tui` session by default (v0.55.1) — to
  catch obvious breakage for the price of a recompile. Acceptance runs on the
  packaged binary and covers install, service lifecycle, vault, TTY, ABI,
  relocation, license viewer, **and the feature paths under test**. This
  product's defects live in host integration; the recorded validation history
  contains no feature defect that source FV would have caught.
- **Re-run scope is proportional to change class.** The full suite is not always
  required.
