## Purpose

This repository contains a Navidrome lyrics plugin that scrapes lyrics from Musixmatch. Navidrome loads the plugin as a WASI WebAssembly module and calls its lyrics extension point. The plugin searches Musixmatch for a requested artist/title, fetches the matched lyrics page, parses embedded Next.js data, and returns synced LRC lyrics when available or plain lyrics as a fallback.

Treat this file as the first source of project context. Search the codebase only when this file is incomplete, stale, or contradicted by the current task.

## Repository Layout

- `plugin/` is the Go module and plugin source root.
- `plugin/main.go` registers the Navidrome lyrics plugin and exports `nd_on_init`.
- `plugin/lyrics.go` implements Navidrome's `GetLyrics` method and delegates to `plugin/musixmatch`.
- `plugin/musixmatch/` contains Musixmatch-specific desktop API, website search/fetch fallback, normalization, and LRC conversion logic.
- `plugin/utils/` contains shared config, logging, constants, and PDK HTTP helpers.
- `plugin/manifest.json` defines Navidrome plugin metadata, HTTP permissions for `apic-desktop.musixmatch.com` and `www.musixmatch.com`, cache permission for the desktop API token, and plugin config schema.
- `just/` and `justfile` define local build, test, install, and cleanup commands.
- `flake.nix` defines the Nix dev shell and reproducible TinyGo/Nix package build.

- Ignore anything inside `navidrome-instance`

## Runtime Flow

1. `plugin/main.go` calls `lyrics.Register(&plugin{})` in `init`.
2. Navidrome calls `(*plugin).GetLyrics` in `plugin/lyrics.go`.
3. `GetLyrics` calls `musixmatch.FetchLyrics` and prefixes returned errors with `navidrome-musixmatch-plugin: `.
4. `musixmatch.FetchLyrics` logs the requested track and first tries the free, unofficial Musixmatch desktop API.
5. `fetchLyricsFromDesktopAPI` gets an anonymous desktop `user_token` via `token.get`, caches it with Navidrome's host cache for 10 minutes, then calls `macro.subtitles.get`.
6. Desktop API lyrics are returned in this order: richsync converted to LRC, subtitle LRC, then plain lyrics.
7. If the desktop API fails or returns no lyrics, `FetchLyrics` falls back to website scraping.
8. `searchForTrack` normalizes artist/title, fetches the Musixmatch website search page, extracts `<script id="__NEXT_DATA__">`, unmarshals embedded search JSON, then chooses `bestMatch` when it is a `track`, otherwise `tracks[0]`.
9. `scrapeWebsiteLyricsForTrack` fetches the Musixmatch lyrics page for the selected `commontrack_vanity_id`, extracts `<script id="__NEXT_DATA__">`, and unmarshals the JSON payload.
10. Website fallback lyrics are returned in this order: synced LRC from `trackStructureList`, synced LRC from `subtitle`, then plain `lyrics.body`.

## Key Files

- `plugin/musixmatch/1_desktop.go` implements the unofficial desktop API path at `apic-desktop.musixmatch.com/ws/1.1`, including 10-minute token caching and `macro.subtitles.get` parsing.
- `plugin/musixmatch/2_search.go` uses `MusixmatchSearchPageURL`, extracts the search page's `__NEXT_DATA__`, and parses `pageProps.data.openSearch.data.opensearchTrackSearch.body`.
- `plugin/musixmatch/3_website_scraper.go` uses `nextDataRe` to parse the Musixmatch page and reads `props.pageProps.data.trackInfo.data`.
- `plugin/musixmatch/4_website_scraper__lyrics_parser.go` converts Musixmatch timestamp totals into LRC tags like `[mm:ss.hh]`.
- `plugin/musixmatch/9_utils.go` normalizes input by lowercasing, stripping diacritics, removing bracketed text, removing common dash suffixes, and collapsing whitespace.
- `plugin/utils/http.go` sends GET requests with PDK HTTP, `Accept-Language: en`, configured `Accept`, configured `User-Agent`, and optional Musixmatch cookies.
- `plugin/utils/constants.go` contains the hardcoded Musixmatch URLs and default headers.

## Configuration

Config keys come from `plugin/manifest.json` and `plugin/utils/constants.go`.

- `musixmatch_user_token` is sent as the `musixmatchUserToken` cookie when set.
- `musixmatch_captcha_id` is sent as the `captcha_id` cookie only when `musixmatch_user_token` is also set.
- `musixmatch_user_agent` defaults to mobile Safari.
- `musixmatch_http_accept` defaults to a browser-like HTML accept header.

The desktop API path does not require user-entered Musixmatch cookies or an official API key. It automatically fetches an anonymous desktop `user_token` and caches it with Navidrome's `host.Cache*` service for 10 minutes. The manifest must keep the `cache` permission so Navidrome exports the required cache host functions.

Note: `musixmatch_captcha_id` exists in the manifest schema, but it is not currently included in `uiSchema.elements`, so verify the Navidrome plugin settings UI before assuming users can edit it there.

## Build And Validation

Run commands from the repository root unless a command states otherwise.

- Enter the Nix dev shell when available: `nix develop`.
- Run tests: `go test ./...` from `plugin/`, or `just test` from the repo root. The Musixmatch desktop API end-to-end test makes real network requests.
- Format Go and repository files: `just format`.
- Vet Go packages: `just lint`.
- Dev WASM build: `just build-dev`.
- Production WASM build: `just build-prod`.
- Package plugin archive: `just package`, which creates `plugin/navidrome-musixmatch-plugin.ndp` from `plugin/manifest.json` and `plugin/plugin.wasm`.
- Dev release package: `just create-dev-release` builds dev WASM and packages it.
- Local dev install: `just install-dev` builds, packages, and copies the `.ndp` to `navidrome-instance/data/plugins/`.
- Production release package: `just create-prod-release` builds the Nix package.
- Fetch lyrics from a local Navidrome test instance: `just fetch-lyrics`.
- Destructive cleanup: `just clean` removes build artifacts and all files under `navidrome-instance/data/plugins/`.
- Reproducible package build: `nix build .#default`.

Validated during repository onboarding: `go test ./...` passes from `plugin/`, but there are currently no test files.

## Fragility And Gotchas

- This uses an unofficial desktop API first and website scraping as fallback. Musixmatch can block requests, require captcha cookies on the website path, or change API/page/search JSON shapes without warning.
- `MusixmatchDesktopAPIURL` uses the unofficial desktop endpoint with `app_id=web-desktop-app-v1.0`; if free lookups start failing, check this endpoint and token flow first.
- Website search parses embedded `__NEXT_DATA__` from `/search?query=...`; it requires a valid `musixmatchUserToken` cookie value and may redirect to auth without one.
- Search result selection is permissive and does not verify returned artist/title equality after normalization.
- `slugify` in `plugin/musixmatch/9_utils.go` appears unused.
- The plugin returns an empty successful lyrics response when search has no results, but returns errors for fetch/parse failures.
- HTTP requests require Navidrome plugin HTTP permission from `manifest.json`; desktop token caching requires cache permission. Do not replace PDK HTTP with standard `net/http` unless Navidrome WASM support is confirmed.

## Dependency Notes

- Main runtime dependency is `github.com/navidrome/navidrome/plugins/pdk/go`.
- `golang.org/x/text` is used for Unicode normalization and diacritic stripping.
- TinyGo is required for WASI plugin builds.
- Nix dev shell includes Go, TinyGo, gopls, gofumpt, zip, just, binaryen, nixfmt-tree, and pinact.

## Best-Practice Source

This file follows the `AGENTS.md` convention: a root Markdown file that gives coding agents project overview, build/test commands, code layout, and known gotchas. The convention is documented at `https://agents.md/` and is also recognized by GitHub Copilot repository custom-instructions documentation as an agent-instructions file.

## Important gotchas

Log stuff using `utils.LogInfof` / `utils.LogErrorf`. For sensitive data, such as the raw responses of HTTP requests, do not log them. Instead log the amount of bytes received. However, you can log the raw response in the Navidrome log using `pdk.Log(pdk.LogDebug, msg)`. This will not be sent to the server, but will be visible in the Navidrome log.
