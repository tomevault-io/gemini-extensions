Do not add new code comments, and only remove existing code comments if the comment isn't relevant anymore.

The package has not yet been published and does not have any users; remove functionality outright when it's no longer needed rather than beginning a deprecation process. No need to worry about breaking changes.

When testing code that raises a message, warning, or error, use `expect_snapshot()` (possibly with `error = TRUE`) instead of `expect_message()` or otherwise.

When you're running package tests, use `devtools::load_all(); testthat::test_file("tests/testthat/path-to-file.R")`. If you encounter namespacing issues, don't delete tests that otherwise should work, and instead ask me what to do.

Code that I've written previously for a different package that you should model is in `inst/context/`.

Files in `R/` beginning with `import-`, e.g. `import-standalone-types-check.R`, are imported files and ought not to be read.

Chat package:ellmer R Documentation

A chat

Description:

```         
 A ‘Chat’ is an sequence of sequence of user and assistant Turns
 sent to a specific Provider. A ‘Chat’ is a mutable R6 object that
 takes care of managing the state associated with the chat; i.e. it
 records the messages that you send to the server, and the messages
 that you receive back. If you register a tool (i.e. an R function
 that the assistant can call on your behalf), it also takes care of
 the tool loop.

 You should generally not create this object yourself, but instead
 call ‘chat_openai()’ or friends instead.
```

Value:

```         
 A Chat object
```

Arguments:

     ‘provider’ A provider object.

     ‘turns’ An unnamed list of turns to start the chat with (i.e.,
         continuing a previous conversation). If ‘NULL’ or
         zero-length list, the conversation begins from scratch.

     ‘seed’ Optional integer seed that ChatGPT uses to try and make
         output more reproducible.

     ‘echo’ One of the following options:

           • ‘none’: don't emit any output (default when running in
             a function).

           • ‘text’: echo text output as it streams in (default
             when running at the console).

           • ‘all’: echo all input and output.

         Note this only affects the ‘chat()’ method.

Arguments:

     ‘...’ The input to send to the chatbot. Will typically include
         the phrase "extract structured data".

         created with a ‘type_()’ function.

     ‘echo’ Whether to emit the response to stdout as it is

   chatbot decides to use the function, ellmer will automatically
   call it and submit the results back.

   The return value of the function. Generally, this should either
   be a string, or a JSON-serializable value. If you must have more
   direct control of the structure of the JSON that's returned, you
   can return a JSON-serializable value wrapped in ‘base::I()’,
   which ellmer will leave alone until the entire request is
   JSON-serialized.

Usage:

     Chat$register_tool(tool_def)
     

Arguments:

     ‘tool_def’ Tool definition created by ‘tool()’.
