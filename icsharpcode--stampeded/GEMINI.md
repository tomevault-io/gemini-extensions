Guidance for Claude Code (and future Claude sessions) when working on Stampeded!.

## What this is

A keyboard-driven desktop code-review tool: a PR or local branch is read as a diff with real
semantic navigation (go to definition, find references, hover docs), blame, CI state, test
results and coverage, in one Avalonia window. See `README.md` for the pitch.

## Tech stack

- **Avalonia 12** with the **Simple** theme (not Fluent), **AvaloniaEdit** for the diff views,
  **Dock** for the pane layout, **Markdown.Avalonia** for rendered descriptions.
- **CommunityToolkit.Mvvm** (`[ObservableProperty]`) for view models; `Dock.Model.Mvvm` `Tool` /
  `Document` for panes and documents.
- **Roslyn** (`Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.*`) for source semantics: two workspaces per review, head
  and merge base, so removed code stays navigable.
- **TextMateSharp** for syntax colours: VS Code's grammars and themes, so a review colours a
  language nobody wrote an editor grammar for. Painted per side and transferred onto the
  document rows (`SyntaxPainter`, `DiffSyntaxColors`) - a grammar is a state machine over
  consecutive lines, and a unified diff is consecutive on neither side. The editor's own xshd
  definitions answer for what the bundle does not carry, which is ILAsm.
- The menu bar is a **NativeMenu**, not a `Menu`: macOS puts it in the system menu bar and
  `NativeMenuBar` draws it inside the window everywhere else, hiding itself where the platform
  took it. A menu item is a model object rather than a control, so it takes no `x:Name` (each
  one the code-behind reaches carries a key as its `CommandParameter` instead), has no
  `ItemsSource`, and shows a gesture only as text unless `Gesture` is set - which on macOS
  registers a real key equivalent that fires before the focused text box sees the key.
- **Light and dark are the reader's choice** (View > Theme, kept in `theme.txt`; the desktop's
  preference only until one is made), and the switch is live. XAML follows the theme variant
  through `DynamicResource`; whatever is painted from code asks `ThemeManager.IsDarkTheme` per
  paint and has to be repainted on `ThemeChanged` - and anything *built* with its colours in it
  (a TextMate painter, a comment box) has to be rebuilt there. `ThemeManager` stays close to
  ILSpy's, so its dark-mode fixes can be carried over.
- **CliWrap** for every external process.
- Target framework `net10.0`. Nullable enabled, implicit usings, `TreatWarningsAsErrors`,
  central package management (a new `PackageReference` needs a `PackageVersion` in
  `Directory.Packages.props`), and `AvaloniaUseCompiledBindingsByDefault` - so a typo in a
  binding path is a build error, not a silent blank.

## Project layout

- `src/Stampeded.Core/` - everything that does not need a UI: git and pull-request-host access,
  diff and fold building, Roslyn hosting, the LSP client, the review store. No Avalonia
  reference; keep it that way.
- `src/Stampeded/` - the Avalonia app: panes, documents, controls, view models.
- `src/Stampeded.RoslynLsp/` - Roslyn as a language server, for reading C# out of process.
- `tests/Stampeded.Core.Tests/` - NUnit, covering `Stampeded.Core` only. The UI layer has no
  automated tests.
- `Stampeded.slnx` builds all four.

## Everything external is a CLI

`git`, `gh`, `az`, `dotnet`, `code` and `xdg-open` are the only ways out of the process, all
through `ExternalTool.RunAsync` (which logs the command, and on failure the first line of its
output - an exit code alone never says what went wrong). There are no API tokens of the tool's
own: auth, SSO and token refresh ride on the user's `gh auth` and `az login`. Keep it that way;
do not add an HTTP client for any host.

A language server is the one exception, because it is not a command with an exit code: it
starts once and answers until the review closes, over JSON-RPC on its stdin and stdout
(`Stampeded.Core/Lsp/`). Everything it does still reaches the log - the command line, the
requests that take a noticeable while, every line of its stderr.

`CliLog.Write` is the log sink the Log pane shows. Anything a user might have to explain to
someone else belongs in it.

## A pull request comes from a host, not from GitHub

Everything a review asks about a pull request - the open list, its branches and description, its
checks, merge state, posted comments and thread resolution, the reviews, a verdict, a merge -
goes through `IPullRequestHost` (`Stampeded.Core/PullRequests/`). There are two:
`GitHubService` over `gh`, and `AzureDevOpsService` over `az` with its `azure-devops` extension
(`az repos pr ...`, `az repos policy ...`, and `az devops invoke` for the REST surface the
extension has no verb for - the analogue of `gh api`).

Which one answers is decided once per workspace, in `PullRequestHosts.ForAsync`, from the remote's
URL: what `AzureDevOpsUrl` parses is Azure DevOps, anything else is GitHub on purpose - `gh`
also serves GitHub Enterprise hosts, which nothing here can enumerate, and a clone with no
remote behaves as it always did. `STAMPEDED_PR_HOST=github|azdo` overrides it.

The remote is not assumed to be called origin: `GitService.GetRemoteAsync` takes
`checkout.defaultRemote`, then origin, then the only remote, then the one the checked-out
branch tracks, and otherwise fails with a message saying how to choose. Every fetch, push and
remote-tracking ref (`RemoteBranchAsync`) goes through it - never write `"origin"` literally. The answer is a
property of the repository, so it sits on `Program.Host` beside `Program.RepoPath` and reaches
the review as `ReviewWorkspace.Host`.

**GitHub's words are the model's words.** `APPROVE` / `REQUEST_CHANGES` / `COMMENT`, `APPROVED`
/ `CHANGES_REQUESTED`, `LEFT` / `RIGHT`, `MERGEABLE` / `BLOCKED`: the panes and the pure
functions under them already speak them, and Azure DevOps - which counts votes from 10 to -10
and has no review object at all - maps onto them inside its own implementation and nowhere
else. Nothing above `IPullRequestHost` knows which host answered; what a pane shows the reader
comes from `HostName`.

Not on Azure DevOps, and refused with a reason rather than hidden: pull requests from forks,
line totals and check state in the pull-request list (a call per row), and the server-side
branch update, for which there is no API. A ```suggestion``` block is GitHub's alone, and posts
as a plain code block elsewhere.

## Semantics come from a provider, not from Roslyn

Everything the review asks about source - what a token means, where it is declared, who uses
it, which member owns a line - goes through `ISemanticProvider` (`Stampeded.Core/Semantics/`).
A symbol is a `SymbolRef`: the file and position that resolves to it, because that is all a
language server can be handed back. There are two implementations: `RoslynWorkspaceService`
in this process, and `LspSemanticProvider` over a server's stdin and stdout.

A review holds one provider pair (head and base) **per language**, so `SemanticsFor(oldSide,
relPath)` is the lookup; the pathless overload is the primary (C#) one. A Python server is
started only for a review that actually changes Python. Its base side is a second process on
a checkout of the base revision - a language server holds one text per file, so two revisions
cannot be one process. Only our own Roslyn server derives one side from the other, which is
what `?side=base` on a document URI means.

Nobody has to install a language server first. The search is `STAMPEDED_PYTHON_LSP`, then
PATH, then one this tool installed for itself, then npx - and when none of that runs, the
review installs one: a virtual environment under `~/.cache/stampeded/python-lsp` with
basedpyright in it, which is pyright plus a node of its own in the wheel, so a machine with
Python and no node still reads Python. Nothing is added to the reader's Python or PATH, every
step is a command in the log, and deleting the directory undoes it. On Windows a bare command
name is not enough to start anything: npm writes both a POSIX shell script and the `.cmd` next
to each other, so PATH lookup offers only what PATHEXT allows (`LanguageServerLookupTests`).

A Python server resolves imports against an interpreter, and the worktree has none: a virtual
environment is not committed. `PythonEnvironment` answers with one from the reader's own
clone - an interpreter path does not have to be inside the workspace - in the order
`STAMPEDED_PYTHON_PATH`, an activated `VIRTUAL_ENV`/`CONDA_PREFIX`, `.venv`/`venv`/`env` in
the repository, then `python3` on PATH. It is offered both at initialize and through
`workspace/configuration`, because servers disagree about which they read.

A project's own pyright configuration - `pyrightconfig.json`, or `[tool.pyright]` in
`pyproject.toml` - is committed, so the worktree has it and the server reads it. Its relative
`venvPath` resolves against that checkout, where there is no environment; the interpreter
supplied above wins over it, which is what keeps such a project readable (`PythonProjectConfigTests`).

A definition that lands outside the review - a package in that environment - opens read-only,
the way a decompiled type does. It used to do nothing at all.

Environment switches, all optional:

- `STAMPEDED_SEMANTICS=lsp` reads C# through `Stampeded.RoslynLsp` instead of in process.
- `STAMPEDED_PYTHON_LSP` / `STAMPEDED_CSHARP_LSP` name a server command line to use instead
  of the search described above.
- `STAMPEDED_PYTHON_PATH` names the interpreter, for an environment none of the usual places
  would find.
- `STAMPEDED_LSP_TRACE=1` logs every request with what came back, and asks the server for its
  own trace-level logging - pyright then reports the interpreter it settled on and every path
  it searches for imports, into the Log pane. This is the thing to turn on when a review
  reads a language on one machine and not on another.

Decompiling a definition without source is not something a language server can answer, so it
is a capability a provider may also have (`IDecompileTargets`), not part of the interface.

The Structure pane and the structural folds go through the provider too, so a Python file
gets both. They pass the text on screen, not just a path: one side of a diff is another
revision, and a provider that only knows the revision it holds answers with nothing rather
than with a tree at the wrong lines. A parser in this process answers before it is asked -
`Task.IsCompletedSuccessfully` - and the views keep their synchronous path for that case.

## Invariants worth knowing

- **`GitService` reads never touch the user's working tree or index.** They come from the object
  database, or from a checkout's files for a review of uncommitted work. Writes that need a
  checkout use a throwaway worktree.
- **A branch lives in one checkout at a time.** Anything that moves a branch ref has to ask
  `ListWorktreesAsync` whether some checkout has it: if one does, the operation runs *there*, so
  its working tree and index move with the ref. Updating the ref behind a checkout's back leaves
  it describing a commit the branch no longer points at, which is exactly what git's own refusals
  exist to prevent. `RebaseBranchAsync` and `PullBranchAsync` both do this.
- **Review worktrees are detached** (`WorktreeManager`), under `~/.cache/stampeded/worktrees`, so
  they never hold the branch being reviewed.
- **A pull request read once can be read again without GitHub.** `PrCache` keeps what only
  GitHub knows - the description, the posted comments, the check runs and the two SHAs - under
  `~/.cache/stampeded/prs`, and `OpenPrAsync` falls back to it when `gh` fails and the commits
  are still in the object database. The change itself is never cached: it is read from those
  commits. An offline review says so and refuses to submit a verdict or a merge.
- **The host is the authority for facts git cannot know**: the viewer's login, a repository's
  default branch. The local `origin/HEAD` is a clone-time snapshot and goes stale.
- **`Stampeded.Core/TreeView/` and `Stampeded/Controls/TreeView/` are vendored from ILSpy.** They
  are meant to stay close to upstream so fixes can move both ways - read
  `src/Stampeded.Core/TreeView/README.md` before changing them, and prefer fixing a bug upstream
  too over diverging.

## Code conventions

- **Tabs**, en-US English, ASCII-only in code and comments.
- **No license headers on new files.** The vendored tree-view files keep their original ILSpy
  headers; nothing else in the repository has one.
- **Comments must stand on their own.** They describe the code as it is, for someone reading the
  file cold. Never reference "the change", "the previous version", "as requested", or anything
  else that only means something inside the conversation that wrote it. A comment explains *why*
  the code is the way it is; the code already says what it does.
- **Report what happened, do not swallow it.** A failed external command surfaces its reason;
  a status line says which of the possible outcomes occurred, not just "done".

## Build and test

Prefix `dotnet` with `OPENSSL_ENABLE_SHA1_SIGNATURES=1` (the local OpenSSL setup needs it):

    OPENSSL_ENABLE_SHA1_SIGNATURES=1 dotnet build Stampeded.slnx
    OPENSSL_ENABLE_SHA1_SIGNATURES=1 dotnet test --solution Stampeded.slnx --report-trx --results-directory test-results

`dotnet test` runs through Microsoft.Testing.Platform (`global.json` pins the runner), so the
solution is named with `--solution` - the bare positional form is VSTest syntax and errors.
`--report-trx` leaves a TRX per test assembly under `test-results/`, which is how a failure
survives the run.

Tests that exercise git create real repositories in temp directories and shell out to `git` -
that is deliberate: the interesting behaviour is git's, and a mock would only assert what we
already believe. See `GitRebaseTests` / `GitPushTests` for the fixture shape, including how to
script `merge.tool` so a conflicted rebase runs without anything interactive.

## Verifying UI changes

The app screenshots itself when a trigger file appears, because Wayland blocks external capture
of its window: write the target PNG path into `/tmp/stampeded-screenshot-request`, optionally
followed by command lines (`goto:<path>:<line>`, `pane:<id>`, `commit-scope`, `overview`, `sbs`,
`press:<x>,<y>[:<modifiers>]` / `release:...`, `context:<x>,<y>`, `tooltip:<x>,<y>`, `wheel:<x>,<y>:<delta>`,
`folder:<path>|cancel`,
... - see `ScreenshotWatcher`). The file is consumed on capture. Only one instance can serve a
request, so shut down extra instances first.

The capture is of whatever window is in front, so a modal dialog photographs itself; `click:`
searches the newest window first for the same reason. A command that opens something runs
*before* the capture but does not finish before it - anything asynchronous needs a second,
plain screenshot request to be seen.

Two lessons that cost a session each:

- **Position bugs need a driven click, not a screenshot of colours.** Highlighting looked fixed
  while the clickable spans were still wrong. `press:` and `release:` take separate modifiers,
  which is what tells a gesture read from the press apart from one read from the release.
- **Reproduce red before claiming a fix.** A crash that did not reproduce under the first
  hypothesis needed a live selection to trigger; without that step the fix would have been a
  guess.

## Commits

Subject is a phrase describing the change, under ~72 characters, no area prefix. The body
explains *why* - the constraint, the decision, what was rejected - and not what the diff already
shows. An AI-assisted commit ends with `Assisted-by: AGENT:MODEL:HARNESS`, e.g.
`Assisted-by: Claude:claude-opus-5:Claude Code`. Never add `Co-Authored-By:` for the AI, and an
agent must not add `Signed-off-by:`.

There is no pre-commit hook; formatting is whatever the surrounding file does.
