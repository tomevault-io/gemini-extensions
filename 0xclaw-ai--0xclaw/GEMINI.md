# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this project is

0xClaw is a general-purpose **autonomous hackathon agent** platform. Given a hackathon URL,
it autonomously runs a 7-phase pipeline on behalf of a human participant:

**Research → Ideation → Selection → Planning → Implementation → Testing → Documentation**

A single user can run 0xClaw against multiple hackathons in sequence. Each run produces
an independent set of gitignored artefacts under `workspace/hackathon/`.

The generated project (Layer 2) is created fresh per hackathon and lives at
`workspace/hackathon/project/` (gitignored at runtime).

## Environment — always do this first

```bash
conda activate 0xclaw          # Python 3.11, all deps installed
cp .env.example .env           # first time only; fill in real API keys
pip install -e .               # runtime deps only
pip install -e .[dev]          # includes ruff linter
./scripts/verify_setup.sh      # confirms runtime import + workspace + API keys
0xclaw                         # canonical runtime entrypoint
0xclaw --logs                  # launch with loguru output visible
0xclaw gateway                 # start Telegram/WhatsApp channel listeners
0xclaw whatsapp login          # one-time WhatsApp bridge auth (writes ~/.0xclaw/whatsapp-auth/)
```

`./scripts/start.sh` is an optional wrapper that activates conda and loads `.env` before running `0xclaw`.
`./scripts/verify_setup.sh` is a preflight checker, not the runtime entrypoint.

Gateway port and heartbeat are configured under `gateway.port` / `gateway.heartbeat` in `0xclaw/config/config.json`; `--port` overrides the configured port for one run.

### Test and lint

```bash
# Run all tests
python -m unittest discover -s tests -p "test_*.py" -v

# Run a single test file
python -m unittest tests.test_router -v

# Run a single test method
python -m unittest tests.test_router.KeywordMatchTests.test_exact_english_keyword_per_phase -v

# Lint
ruff check tests
```

Tests use Python `unittest` (not pytest). Each test file adds `0xclaw/` to `sys.path` and imports from `orchestration.*` directly.

CI runs on push/PR to master: `ruff check tests` + `python -m unittest discover` on Python 3.11 and 3.12.

### Required `.env` keys

| Key | Purpose | Notes |
|-----|---------|-------|
| `ZAI_API_KEY` | Primary LLM via Z.ai (international) | `zhipu` provider in config; model `glm-4.5` |
| `FLOCK_API_KEY` | Secondary LLM via FLock.io | HTTP 400 = budget exhausted |
| `BRAVE_API_KEY` | Web search | Optional |

## Two-layer architecture

```
Layer 1 — 0xClaw (the agent we maintain)
  0xclaw/main.py            CLI entry point, interactive REPL, slash commands
  0xclaw/orchestration/     Phase routing, state machine, write guards, model profiles
  0xclaw/config/            config.json (providers), model_profiles.json (per-phase settings)
  0xclaw/runtime/           Integrated agent runtime engine (modify carefully; prefer leaving core engine untouched unless a runtime bug fix is required)
  launcher/                 CLI entry point wrapper (resolves 0x hex-literal import issue)
  workspace/                Agent identity, skills, pipeline state

Layer 2 — Generated project (per-hackathon, gitignored)
  workspace/hackathon/project/    The built project (gitignored)
  workspace/hackathon/submission/ README, pitch, and submission docs (gitignored)
```

## Orchestration layer

The `0xclaw/orchestration/` package sits between `main.py` and the agent runtime.

**`SkillRouter`** maps free-form user input to a pipeline phase via keyword rules, with an
LLM classifier as fallback. `KEYWORD_MAP` in `router.py` covers English and Chinese triggers.
Important: Chinese keywords use plain substring matching (not `\b` word boundaries, which
break for CJK characters).

**`OrchestratorStateMachine`** validates phase entry — checks that all dependency phases are
`done` and required artifact files exist. The per-phase write allowlist `PHASE_ALLOWED_WRITE_DIRS`
is defined in `state.py`; `write_guard.py` is the monkey-patch enforcer that consults it via
`state_machine.assert_write_allowed()`.

**`PipelineStateStore`** is a file-backed store at `workspace/hackathon/pipeline_state.json`.
Phase lifecycle: `pending → running → done | failed | cancelled`.

**Write guards** — `install_phase_write_guards()` monkey-patches the runtime's `write_file` /
`edit_file` tools so sub-agents can only write inside their allowed directories. A violation
returns an error string; it does not raise (sub-agent continues safely).

**`ModelProfileResolver`** loads `model_profiles.json` to resolve per-phase model, max_tokens,
temperature, and timeout overrides on top of the defaults in `config.json`.

**`Envelope`** — typed dataclass wrapping every CLI → AgentLoop phase invocation. Serialised to
`workspace/hackathon/envelopes.jsonl` for audit/replay. Contains phase name, command, timestamp,
model profile used, and run metadata.

**`SessionControl`** implements `/resume` by scanning `pipeline_state.json` for the first
non-`done` phase and returning its natural-language command (via `PHASE_TO_COMMAND`).

## Runtime internals

> The agent runtime lives in `0xclaw/runtime/`. It is the execution engine for all agent
> behaviour — prefer not to modify it unless a runtime bug fix is required. Keep changes
> tightly scoped, and preserve existing `from runtime.xxx import yyy` import style.

**Skills** — `SKILL.md` files in `workspace/skills/{name}/`. Frontmatter key is `openclaw`.
Auto-loaded when `always: true` is set; loaded on-demand via `read_file` otherwise.

**`spawn()`** — creates a background asyncio sub-agent with its own isolated tool registry
(no `spawn` or `message` tools). Results arrive as `channel="system"` messages on the main
agent's bus. Sub-agents have no shared memory — all context must be embedded in the task string.

**Workspace bootstrap** — `SOUL.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and `HEARTBEAT.md` are loaded every turn.
`MEMORY.md` is loaded separately for long-term state.

**`sync_workspace_templates`** — called at startup. Creates missing workspace files from
templates in `runtime/templates/`; never overwrites files that already exist.

**File paths in tasks** — the runtime resolves relative paths as `workspace_dir / path`.
Always write `hackathon/context.json` (not `workspace/hackathon/context.json`). Same rule
applies to `exec()` working directory.

## Provider / model details

### Z.ai (primary LLM — `provider: "zhipu"`)
- Endpoint: `https://api.z.ai/api/paas/v4` (international; NOT bigmodel.cn)
- Auth: `ZAI_API_KEY` via standard Bearer token
- Default model: `glm-4.5` (`config.json`); all 7 phases use `glm-4.5` (`model_profiles.json`)
- OpenAI-compatible API; LiteLLM routes as `zai/<model>` automatically
- Configured under both `zhipu` and `custom` keys in `config.json` (identical settings)
- If `README.md` and `model_profiles.json` disagree on the default model, `model_profiles.json` is authoritative — README may be stale

### FLock.io (secondary LLM — `provider: "flock"`)
- Endpoint: `https://api.flock.io/v1`
- Auth: custom header `x-litellm-api-key: $FLOCK_API_KEY` (not standard Bearer)
- Routed through LiteLLM as `openai/<model>` with `api_base` override
- HTTP 400 = budget exhausted

### Observability

No tracing or span hooks are wired up in the runtime today — ignore any historical references to `workflow_span` or external observability backends.

### Adding a new provider
Edit `config.json` (add under `providers`). Update `runtime/config/schema.py` only if adding
a new typed field to `ProvidersConfig`. The `agents.defaults.provider` key picks the default
provider when no model-level override is active.

---

## Slash commands (CLI)

| Command | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| `/status` | Show pipeline phase progress (which phases are done/running/failed) |
| `/resume` | Resume from last pipeline checkpoint (reads `pipeline_state.json`) |
| `/redo <phase>` | Reset one phase (and downstream phases) and run it again |
| `/new` | Reset session — clears all hackathon runtime outputs |
| `/stop` | Cancel the currently running agent/sub-agent work for the current session |
| `/exit` | Exit the CLI |
| `/help` | Show this list |
| `?` | Alias for `/help` |
| `!<cmd>` | Run shell command passthrough in CLI |

Phase commands are free-form natural language routed by `SkillRouter`. Each phase invocation
wraps the input in an `Envelope` and sends it to the `AgentLoop` with a per-phase timeout from
`model_profiles.json`. The `/stop` command sends a `"/stop"` inbound message through the same
message bus so the runtime can cancel active session tasks and running subagents.

---

## Pipeline phase artifacts

All outputs live in `workspace/hackathon/` (gitignored at runtime):

| Phase | Output | Required inputs |
|-------|--------|-----------------|
| research | `context.json`, `research_summary.md` | — |
| idea | `ideas.json` | `context.json` |
| selection | `selected_idea.json` | `ideas.json` |
| planning | `plan.md`, `tasks.json` | `selected_idea.json` |
| coding | `project/` | `tasks.json`, `plan.md` |
| testing | `test_results.json` | `project/` |
| doc | `submission/` | `test_results.json` |

Additional runtime files (also gitignored):
- `envelopes.jsonl` — append-only log of every phase invocation
- `metrics.jsonl` — per-run latency / token metrics from `MetricsLogger`
- `pipeline_state.json` — current phase status map

---

## Rules and constraints

- **Prefer not to modify `0xclaw/runtime/`** — it is the engine; only make tightly scoped runtime changes when fixing real runtime bugs, and keep the rest of the engine untouched
- **Never commit `.env`** — gitignored, but double-check before any push
- **All workspace/hackathon/ outputs are gitignored** — they are runtime artefacts, not source
- **Sub-agent task strings must be self-contained** — sub-agents have no shared memory
- **Write guard violations surface as tool errors**, not Python exceptions — sub-agent continues
- **litellm requires openai>=1.66** — do not downgrade openai below 1.66 (breaks `openai.types.responses`)
- **`launcher/` is the CLI entry point wrapper** — `pyproject.toml` points `0xclaw` command here; do not rename it
