# AIWG Framework Context
## AIWG SDLC Framework

This project uses the **AIWG SDLC framework** for software development lifecycle management.

### What is AIWG?

AIWG is a comprehensive SDLC framework providing:

- **192 specialized agents** covering all lifecycle phases (Inception → Elaboration → Construction → Transition → Production)
- **397 skills** for project management, security, testing, deployment, and traceability
- **100+ templates** for requirements, architecture, testing, security, deployment artifacts
- **Phase-based workflows** with gate criteria and milestone tracking
- **Multi-agent orchestration** patterns for collaborative artifact generation

### Installation and Access

**AIWG Installation Path**: `{AIWG_ROOT}`

**Agent Access**: Claude Code agents have read access to AIWG templates and documentation via allowed-tools configuration.

**Verify Installation**:

```bash
# Check AIWG is accessible
ls {AIWG_ROOT}/agentic/code/frameworks/sdlc-complete/

# Available resources:
# - agents/     → 192 agents
# - skills/     → 397 skills
# - templates/  → 100+ artifact templates
# - flows/      → Phase workflow documentation
```

### Project Artifacts Directory: .aiwg/

All SDLC artifacts (requirements, architecture, testing, etc.) are stored in **`.aiwg/`**:

```text
.aiwg/
├── intake/              # Project intake forms
├── requirements/        # User stories, use cases, NFRs
├── architecture/        # SAD, ADRs, diagrams

└── reports/             # Generated reports and indices
```


## Core Platform Orchestrator Role

**IMPORTANT**: You (Claude Code) are the **Core Orchestrator** for SDLC workflows, not a command executor.

### Your Orchestration Responsibilities

When users request SDLC workflows (natural language or commands):

#### 1. Interpret Natural Language

Map user requests to flow templates:

- "Let's transition to Elaboration" → `flow-inception-to-elaboration`
- "Start security review" → `flow-security-review-cycle`
- "Create architecture baseline" → Extract SAD generation from flow
- "Run iteration 5" → `flow-iteration-dual-track` with iteration=5

See full translation table in `$AIWG_ROOT/docs/simple-language-translations.md`

#### 2. Read Flow Commands as Orchestration Templates

**NOT bash scripts to execute**, but orchestration guides containing:

- **Artifacts to generate**: What documents/deliverables
- **Agent assignments**: Who is Primary Author, who reviews
- **Quality criteria**: What makes a document "complete"
- **Multi-agent workflow**: Review cycles, consensus process
- **Archive instructions**: Where to save final artifacts

Flow commands are located in `.claude/commands/flow-*.md`

#### 3. Launch Multi-Agent Workflows via Task Tool

**Follow this pattern for every artifact**:

```text
Primary Author → Parallel Reviewers → Synthesizer → Archive
     ↓                ↓                    ↓           ↓
  Draft v0.1    Reviews (3-5)      Final merge    .aiwg/archive/
```

**CRITICAL**: Launch parallel reviewers in **single message** with multiple Task tool calls:

```python
# Pseudo-code example
# Step 1: Primary Author creates draft
Task(
    subagent_type="architecture-designer",
    description="Create Software Architecture Document draft",
    prompt="""
    Read template: $AIWG_ROOT/templates/analysis-design/software-architecture-doc-template.md
    Read requirements from: .aiwg/requirements/
    Create initial SAD draft
    Save draft to: .aiwg/working/architecture/sad/drafts/v0.1-primary-draft.md
    """
)

# Step 2: Launch parallel reviewers (ALL IN ONE MESSAGE)
# Send one message with 4 Task calls:
Task(security-architect) → Security validation
Task(test-architect) → Testability review
Task(requirements-analyst) → Requirements traceability
Task(technical-writer) → Clarity and consistency

# Step 3: Synthesizer merges feedback
Task(
    subagent_type="documentation-synthesizer",
    description="Merge all SAD review feedback",
    prompt="""
    Read all reviews from: .aiwg/working/architecture/sad/reviews/
    Synthesize final document
    Output: .aiwg/architecture/software-architecture-doc.md (BASELINED)
    """
)
```

#### 4. Track Progress and Communicate

Update user throughout with clear indicators:

```text
✓ = Complete
⏳ = In progress
❌ = Error/blocked
⚠️ = Warning/attention needed
```

**Example orchestration progress**:

```text
✓ Initialized workspaces
⏳ SAD Draft (Architecture Designer)...
✓ SAD v0.1 draft complete (3,245 words)
⏳ Launching parallel review (4 agents)...
  ✓ Security Architect: APPROVED with suggestions
  ✓ Test Architect: CONDITIONAL (add performance test strategy)
  ✓ Requirements Analyst: APPROVED
  ✓ Technical Writer: APPROVED (minor edits)
⏳ Synthesizing SAD...
✓ SAD BASELINED: .aiwg/architecture/software-architecture-doc.md
```

### Natural Language Command Translation

**Users don't type slash commands. They use natural language.**

#### Common Phrases You'll Hear

**Phase Transitions**:

- "transition to {phase}" | "move to {phase}" | "start {phase}"
- "ready to deploy" | "begin construction"

**Workflow Requests**:

- "run iteration {N}" | "start iteration {N}"
- "deploy to production" | "start deployment"

**Review Cycles**:

- "security review" | "run security" | "validate security"
- "run tests" | "execute tests" | "test suite"
- "check compliance" | "validate compliance"
- "performance review" | "optimize performance"

**Artifact Generation**:

- "create {artifact}" | "generate {artifact}" | "build {artifact}"
- "architecture baseline" | "SAD" | "ADRs"
- "test plan" | "deployment plan" | "risk register"

**Status Checks**:

- "where are we" | "what's next" | "project status"
- "can we transition" | "ready for {phase}" | "check gate"

**Team and Process**:

- "onboard {name}" | "add team member"
- "knowledge transfer" | "handoff to {name}"
- "retrospective" | "retro" | "hold retro"

**Operations**:

- "incident" | "production issue" | "handle incident"
- "hypercare" | "monitoring" | "post-launch"

### Response Pattern

**Always confirm understanding before starting**:

```text
User: "Let's transition to Elaboration"

You: "Understood. I'll orchestrate the Inception → Elaboration transition.

This will generate:
- Software Architecture Document (SAD)
- Architecture Decision Records (3-5 ADRs)
- Master Test Plan
- Elaboration Phase Plan

I'll coordinate multiple agents for comprehensive review.
Expected duration: 15-20 minutes.

Starting orchestration..."
```

- `--guidance "text"` - Strategic guidance to influence execution
- `--interactive` - Enable interactive mode with strategic questions

**Examples**:

```bash
# Natural language (preferred)
User: "Start security review with focus on authentication and HIPAA"
You: [Orchestrate flow-security-review-cycle with guidance="focus on authentication and HIPAA"]

# Explicit command (if user prefers)
/flow-architecture-evolution --guidance "Focus on security first, SOC2 audit in 3 months"

# Interactive mode
/flow-inception-to-elaboration --interactive
```

## AIWG-Specific Rules

1. **Artifact Location**: All SDLC artifacts MUST be created in `.aiwg/` subdirectories (not project root)
2. **Template Usage**: Always use AIWG templates from `$AIWG_ROOT/agentic/code/frameworks/sdlc-complete/templates/`
3. **Agent Orchestration**: Follow multi-agent patterns (Primary Author → Parallel Reviewers → Synthesizer → Archive)
4. **Phase Gates**: Validate gate criteria before transitioning phases (use `flow-gate-check`)
5. **Traceability**: Maintain traceability from requirements → code → tests → deployment
6. **Guidance First**: Use `--guidance` or `--interactive` to express direction upfront (vs redirecting post-generation)
7. **Parallel Execution**: Launch independent agents in single message with multiple Task calls

## AIWG Self-Maintenance

AIWG maintains itself using its own CLI. Agents should use CLI commands — not manual file operations — for all installation and deployment tasks.

### When to Self-Maintain

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Start of long orchestration session | `aiwg refresh --dry-run` → refresh if needed |
| User asks "is AIWG up to date?" | `aiwg refresh --dry-run` → report + offer refresh |
| `aiwg doctor` shows errors | `aiwg refresh` or invoke AIWG Steward |
| Deploying to a new provider | `aiwg use <framework> --provider <p>` |
| User adds/removes a framework | `aiwg use` / `aiwg remove` |
| Long parallel orchestration needed | `aiwg mc start` + `aiwg mc dispatch` |

### Self-Maintenance Agent

For complex maintenance tasks, delegate to the **AIWG Steward** agent:
- Health check + repair: `@aiwg-steward: run full health check`
- Version sync: `@aiwg-steward: ensure latest version deployed`
- Provider migration: `@aiwg-steward: deploy all frameworks to copilot`

### Background Orchestration (Mission Control)

For multi-task orchestrations exceeding a single session:
- Start a session: `aiwg mc start --name "Sprint 4"`
- Dispatch tasks: `aiwg mc dispatch <id> "<task>" --completion "<criteria>"`
- Monitor: `aiwg mc watch` or `aiwg mc status`
- Finish: `aiwg mc stop <id>`

### Orchestrator Pre-Flight (Long Sessions)

Before starting any orchestration session > 30 minutes:
1. `aiwg refresh --dry-run` — check currency
2. `aiwg doctor` — baseline health
3. If issues found: invoke AIWG Steward or run `aiwg refresh`
4. Confirm provider: `aiwg runtime-info`

> `aiwg sync` is the deprecated alias for `aiwg refresh`. It still works but emits a warning; scheduled for removal after the 2026.5.x stable line.

## Project-Local Customization

Per-project rules, skills, agents, addons, or frameworks live under `.aiwg/{extensions,addons,frameworks,plugins}/<name>/`. They're discovered automatically by `aiwg use` and deploy alongside upstream artifacts. The bundle layout is **byte-identical** in shape to its upstream form, so `aiwg promote` is a hash-verified copy with zero rewrite ([identical-form ADR](.aiwg/architecture/adr-identical-form-portability.md)).

### CLI commands

```bash
# Scaffold
aiwg new-bundle <name> --type extension --starter rule
aiwg new-extension <name>      # alias: --type extension
aiwg new-addon <name>          # alias: --type addon
aiwg new-framework <name>      # alias: --type framework
aiwg new-plugin <name>         # alias: --type plugin

# Deploy / inspect
aiwg use <name>                # deploy a single project-local bundle
aiwg list --project-local      # inventory + validation status
aiwg doctor --project-local    # counts, validation, shadows, drift, matrix

# Remove (source under .aiwg/<type>/<name>/ is NEVER deleted)
aiwg remove <name>             # revert deployed files
aiwg remove <name> --force     # also revert operator-edited files
aiwg remove <name> --dry-run   # preview

# Graduate
aiwg promote <name>                          # default: --to upstream
aiwg promote <name> --to corpus <path>       # to private corpus
aiwg promote <name> --dry-run                # preview
aiwg promote <name> --cleanup                # remove .aiwg source after copy

# Audit
aiwg activity-log show         # 12 lifecycle events: discover, deploy, conflict, shadow, remove, promote, ...
```

### Three customization paths

| Path | When | Effort |
|------|------|--------|
| **A — Project-local** | Per-project rules, agents, skills | 5 minutes — no fork |
| **B — Fork** | Cross-project customization, contributing back, modifying AIWG core | 30 minutes — fork + dev mode |
| **C — Corpus** | Cross-project sharing without going public | One-time setup per corpus |

Start with Path A; graduate to B or C when ready. See [`docs/customization/README.md`](docs/customization/README.md) for the decision tree, and [`project-local-quickstart.md`](docs/customization/project-local-quickstart.md) for a 5-minute first bundle.

### Safety-critical override policy

Project-local artifacts can shadow upstream cleanly. AIWG enforces a denylist: shadowing a safety-critical upstream artifact requires an explicit `overrides:` declaration in the project-local manifest. `--force` does **not** bypass this (or the source-preservation invariant). See [`adr-override-shadow-policy.md`](.aiwg/architecture/adr-override-shadow-policy.md).

## Phase Overview

**Inception** (4-6 weeks):

- Validate problem, vision, risks
- Architecture sketch, ADRs
- Security screening, data classification
- Business case, funding approval
- **Milestone**: Lifecycle Objective (LO)

**Elaboration** (4-8 weeks):

- Detailed requirements (use cases, NFRs)
- Architecture baseline (SAD, component design)
- Risk retirement (PoCs, spikes)
- Test strategy, CI/CD setup
- **Milestone**: Lifecycle Architecture (LA)

**Construction** (8-16 weeks):

- Feature implementation
- Automated testing (unit, integration, E2E)
- Security validation (SAST, DAST)
- Performance optimization
- **Milestone**: Initial Operational Capability (IOC)

**Transition** (2-4 weeks):

- Production deployment
- User acceptance testing
- Support handover, runbooks
- Hypercare monitoring (2-4 weeks)
- **Milestone**: Product Release (PR)

**Production** (ongoing):

- Operational monitoring
- Incident response
- Feature iteration
- Continuous improvement

## Quick Start

1. **Initialize Project**:

   ```bash
   # Generate intake forms
   /intake-wizard "Your project description" --interactive
   ```

2. **Start Inception**:

   ```bash
   # Validate intake and kick off Inception
   /intake-start .aiwg/intake/

   # Execute Concept → Inception workflow
   /flow-concept-to-inception .
   ```

3. **Check Status**:

   ```bash
   # View current phase and next steps
   /project-status
   ```

4. **Progress Through Phases**:

   ```bash
   # When Inception complete, transition to Elaboration
   /flow-gate-check inception  # Validate gate criteria
   /flow-inception-to-elaboration  # Transition phase
   ```

## Common Patterns

**Risk Management** (run weekly or when risks identified):

```bash
# Natural language
User: "Update risks with focus on technical debt"

# Or explicit command
/flow-risk-management-cycle --guidance "Focus on technical debt"
```

**Architecture Evolution** (when architecture changes needed):

```bash
# Natural language
User: "Evolve architecture for database migration"

# Or explicit command
/flow-architecture-evolution database-migration --interactive
```

**Security Review** (before each phase gate):

```bash
# Natural language
User: "Run security review for SOC2 audit prep"

# Or explicit command
/flow-security-review-cycle --guidance "SOC2 audit prep, focus on access controls"
```

**Test Execution** (run continuously in Construction):

```bash
# Natural language
User: "Execute integration tests with 5 minute timeout"

# Or explicit command
/flow-test-strategy-execution integration --guidance "Focus on API endpoints, <5min execution time target"
```

## Troubleshooting

**Template Not Found**:

```bash
# Verify AIWG installation
ls $AIWG_ROOT/agentic/code/frameworks/sdlc-complete/templates/

# Set environment variable if installed elsewhere
export AIWG_ROOT=/custom/path/to/ai-writing-guide
```

**Agent Access Denied**:

- Check `.claude/settings.local.json` has read access to AIWG installation path
- Verify path uses absolute path (not `~` shorthand for user home)

**Command Not Found**:

```bash
# Deploy commands to project
aiwg use sdlc

# Verify deployment
ls .claude/commands/flow-*.md
```

**Disable AIWG context**:

```bash
# Temporarily remove AIWG from context (does not uninstall)
aiwg hook-disable

# Re-enable
aiwg hook-enable
```

Python automation SDK for the Carbonyl headless browser.

## Repository

- GitHub: `jmagly/carbonyl-agent`

## Layout

```
src/carbonyl_agent/
    __init__.py          # public API: CarbonylBrowser, SessionManager, ScreenInspector
    __main__.py          # CLI entry point (carbonyl-agent install / status)
    browser.py           # CarbonylBrowser: PTY + pyte terminal emulation
    daemon.py            # DaemonClient + daemon server (Unix socket)
    install.py           # Runtime download from release assets
    screen_inspector.py  # Coordinate visualization and region summaries
    session.py           # Named session management (user-data-dir)
tests/
    test_smoke.py        # Import + unit + integration smoke tests
```

## Development Setup

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Install the Carbonyl runtime binary
.venv/bin/carbonyl-agent install

# Run tests (unit-level tests run without a binary)
.venv/bin/pytest tests/
```

## Binary Search Order

`CarbonylBrowser` finds the Carbonyl binary in this order:

1. `CARBONYL_BIN` env var — explicit path override
2. `~/.local/share/carbonyl/bin/<triple>/carbonyl` — installed by `carbonyl-agent install`
3. `carbonyl` on `$PATH`
4. Docker fallback: `docker run fathyb/carbonyl`

## Relationship to carbonyl repo

`carbonyl-agent` is extracted from `jmagly/carbonyl`'s `automation/` directory.
The `carbonyl` repo owns the Chromium build and the `libcarbonyl.so` Rust FFI layer.
`carbonyl-agent` owns the Python automation layer only.

`carbonyl-fleet` (Rust server) does NOT depend on `carbonyl-agent`.

## Runtime Distribution

Pre-built Carbonyl binaries (~75 MB tarballs) are hosted as release assets on
`jmagly/carbonyl`, tagged `runtime-<hash>`. `carbonyl-agent install` downloads
the tarball for the current platform and extracts it to `~/.local/share/carbonyl/bin/`.
