## 🏛️ Architecture Contract (MANDATORY)

**Before writing any implementation code, read:**
**[docs/coding_standards/ARCHITECTURE_PRINCIPLES.md](docs/coding_standards/ARCHITECTURE_PRINCIPLES.md)**

This document is a **binding contract**. Code that violates these principles is **REJECTED**, regardless of whether tooling gates pass.

### Most common violations (quick reference):

| Violation | Correct pattern |
|---|---|
| Hardcoded phase/workflow names in Python | Read from config (WorkflowConfig / GitConfig) |
| `SomeManager()` inside `execute()` | Constructor injection via `__init__` |
| Write-capable interface for read-only consumer | Use narrow read-only interface (ISP) |
| `get_state()` calls `save()` | CQS violation — split the method |
| Module-level `Config.load()` | `ClassVar` + lazy init in `__init__` |
| if-chain on `phase == "implementation"` etc. | Registry or config-driven dispatch (OCP) |
| Value object without `frozen=True` | Add `@dataclass(frozen=True)` or `ConfigDict(frozen=True)` |
| Issue number extracted in state engine | Delegate to git conventions config class |

---

## 🔧 Tool Priority Matrix (MANDATORY)

**Never use `run_in_terminal` or default/built-in agent tools (e.g., `write_to_file`, `replace_file_content`, `multi_replace_file_content`) for these operations — use MCP tools instead:**

---

## 🚫 run_in_terminal Restrictions (CRITICAL)

**`run_in_terminal` is ONLY allowed for:**

✅ **Permitted (rare cases):**
- Development servers where no MCP tool exists (e.g., `npm run dev`, `python -m http.server`)
- Build commands explicitly requested by user
- Smoke tests / exploratory commands approved by user
- Python package installations via pip (when not using install_python_packages tool)

❌ **FORBIDDEN (use MCP tool instead):**
- **File operations** → use `safe_edit_file` / `scaffold_artifact`
- **Git operations** → use `git_*` tools (see matrix above)
- **Test execution** → use `run_tests` tool
- **Quality gates** → use `run_quality_gates` tool

**Default rule: If unsure, ask yourself "Is there an MCP tool for this?" If yes → use it. If no → ask user permission first.**

---

## 🔴 TDD Cycle (RED → GREEN → REFACTOR)

**Strict protocol — never skip steps:**

1. **RED Phase:** Write failing test FIRST
   - Commit: `git_add_or_commit(workflow_phase="implementation", sub_phase="red", cycle_number=1, message="Add failing test for X")`
   - Verify test fails: `run_tests(path="...")`

2. **GREEN Phase:** Implement minimal code to pass test
   - Commit: `git_add_or_commit(workflow_phase="implementation", sub_phase="green", cycle_number=1, message="Implement X")`
   - Verify test passes: `run_tests(path="...")`

3. **REFACTOR Phase:** Improve code while keeping tests green
   - Commit: `git_add_or_commit(workflow_phase="implementation", sub_phase="refactor", cycle_number=1, message="Refactor X")`
   - Verify tests still pass: `run_tests(path="...")`

4. **DOCUMENTATION Phase:** Update documentation
   - Commit: `git_add_or_commit(workflow_phase="documentation", message="Document X")`

**Quality Gates:** Run `run_quality_gates(files=[...])` before phase transitions and before PR creation.

---

## ⚖️ Prime Directives

1. **Issue-First Development:** Never work directly on `main`. Always start with `create_issue` → `create_branch` → `initialize_project`.
2. **Workflow Enforcement:** Always `initialize_project` before work. Use `transition_phase` for progression.
3. **TDD is Non-Negotiable:** If you write code without a test, you are violating protocol.
4. **Tools > Manual:** Never manually create a file if `scaffold_artifact` exists. Never manually parse status if `get_work_context` exists.
5. **English Artifacts, Dutch Chat:** Write Code/Docs/Commits in **English**. Talk to the User in **Dutch** (Nederlands).
6. **Human-in-the-Loop:** PR merge ALWAYS requires human approval. `force_phase_transition` requires approval + reason.
7. **Quality Gates:** Run before phase transitions and before PR creation. Linting 10.00/10 + Type checking Pass.
8. **Type-Checking Consistency:** Resolve typing issues using [docs/coding_standards/TYPE_CHECKING_PLAYBOOK.md](docs/coding_standards/TYPE_CHECKING_PLAYBOOK.md). No global disables; targeted ignores only as last resort.
9. **Resource Caching:** All MCP tools cache their structured Pydantic DTO outputs as MCP Resources (`pgmcp://cache/runs/{run_id}`). Tools return a presented text summary and the resource URI. When you need to inspect complete structured data or verbose process logs (e.g. from `run_quality_gates` or `run_tests`), you MUST read the cached resource URI (do not try to parse or scrape the text output).
10. **Strict Tool Abstraction (pgmcp):** Do not read or search the source code of the `pgmcp` server (`.venv/Lib/site-packages/mcp_server/`) during normal operation. Rely exclusively on the documented MCP tools, schemas, and reference documents. Only access the server code when explicitly debugging a server crash/error and requested by the user.

## 🧭 Strategy Approval Gate (MANDATORY)

Compatibility, migration, and breakage strategy is decided at the end of Research, not later.

- Research must identify the affected boundaries, consumers, strategy options, and the cost / risk / impact trade-offs for each relevant boundary.
- Research must not close until the human decision is captured as an Approved Strategy.
- The Approved Strategy must be explicit per affected boundary, not left as a vague issue-wide assumption.
- Design may not start until an Approved Strategy exists for the boundaries it will shape.
- Planning, implementation, and QA must treat the Approved Strategy as binding input.
- No later phase may silently switch between preserve compatibility, temporary bridge, or clean break.
- If later evidence makes the Approved Strategy unsound, stop and reopen the decision explicitly instead of changing strategy by stealth.

## 📋 Workflow Types

| Workflow | Phases | Use Case |
|----------|--------|----------|
| `feature` | research, design, planning, implementation, validation, documentation, ready | New feature development |
| `bug` | research, design, planning, implementation, validation, documentation, ready | Bug fixes |
| `docs` | planning, documentation, ready | Documentation-only changes |
| `refactor` | research, planning, implementation, validation, documentation, ready | Code refactoring |
| `hotfix` | implementation, validation, documentation, ready | Emergency fixes |
| `epic` | See `.pgmcp/config/contracts.yaml` (SSOT for epic phase order) | Large multi-issue features |
| `custom` | (user-defined) | Custom workflows |

**Workflow Selection:** Use `initialize_project(issue_number, issue_title, workflow_name="feature|bug|docs|...")` to start.

---

## 🏗️ Scaffolding (Always Use Templates)

**NEVER use `safe_edit_file` to create code or documentation from scratch. Always use `scaffold_artifact`.**

| Example Artifact Type | Use Case | Example |
|---------------|----------|---------|
| `dto` | Data Transfer Objects | `scaffold_artifact(artifact_type="dto", name="UserDTO", context={...})` |
| `worker` | Background processors | `scaffold_artifact(artifact_type="worker", name="ProcessWorker", context={...})` |
| `tool` | MCP tools | `scaffold_artifact(artifact_type="tool", name="MyTool", context={...})` |
| `research` | Research documents | `scaffold_artifact(artifact_type="research", name="my-research", context={...})` |
| `design` | Design documents | `scaffold_artifact(artifact_type="design", name="my-design", context={...})` |
| `reference` | Reference docs | `scaffold_artifact(artifact_type="reference", name="my-reference", context={...})` |

These are representative examples, not the complete registry. Current first-class types also include `adapter`, `resource`, `interface`, `service`, `schema`, `generic`, `unit_test`, `integration_test`, `architecture`, `planning`, `validation_report`, `generic_doc`, `commit`, `pr`, and `issue`.

**Registry:** `.pgmcp/config/artifacts.yaml` defines the authoritative complete set of artifact types and their templates.

**Schema discovery:** Before calling `scaffold_artifact` with an artifact type whose context fields are not already in your working context, call `scaffold_schema(artifact_type=...)` first. It returns the full JSON Schema for the `context` parameter — required and optional fields — enabling first-time-right scaffolding without a failed call. If you call `scaffold_artifact` with wrong or missing context fields, the error response contains the same schema; use it to correct the call immediately.

## 🤝 Three-Agent Model & Standalone Research

This project uses three specialized agents in separate VS Code chat sessions to prevent role contamination and context pollution, along with a standalone research agent for deep exploratory work.

### Roles

| Agent | Role | Allowed operations |
|-------|------|--------------------|
| `@co` | Coordination authority and epic workflow owner | Read all; issue/label/milestone admin; epic docs/contracts/prompts edits; epic lifecycle mutations, phase transitions, commits, quality gates, PR submission, and merge within the approved narrow allowlist |
| `@imp` | Child-issue implementation executor | Production code and test work on non-epic branches; cycle execution; commits; phase and cycle transitions |
| `@qa` | QA authority — read-only | Read files; run tests; run quality gates. **No edits, no commits** |
| `@research` | Standalone Research Agent | Read all; web searching; explore codebase and documentation. Operates outside phase-gate workflows. **No edits, no commits** |

### Sub-roles

**`@co` sub-roles:** coordination: `triager` (default), `backlog-reviewer`, `tracker`, `issue-author`; epic lifecycle: `epic-researcher`, `epic-planner`, `epic-designer`, `epic-coordinator`, `epic-documenter`, `epic-releaser`  
**`@imp` sub-roles:** `researcher` (default), `planner`, `designer`, `implementer`, `validator`, `documenter`  
**`@qa` sub-roles:** `design-reviewer` (default), `plan-verifier`, `verifier`, `validation-reviewer`, `doc-reviewer`

Declare your active sub-role in the invocation text.  
Example: `@imp implementer: start cycle C_LOADER.5 for issue 257`

### @co Operating Modes

- **Owned-branch epic execution:** `@co` owns the epic branch end-to-end and may edit epic docs/contracts/prompts, perform lifecycle mutations, phase transitions, commits, quality gates, PR submission, and merge after approval.
- **Background coordination:** `@co` reads status, updates issue coordination state, and hands child technical work to `@imp` without taking over the implementation branch.

### Two-Chat Model

- **Coordination / epic ownership** → use `@co`. Use `@co` either for owned-branch epic execution or for background coordination around child work. Produce a Co → Imp hand-over only when delegating child technical implementation.
- **Implementation** → use `@imp` for child technical work. Execute the current cycle. Produce an Imp → QA hand-over.
- **Review** → use `@qa`. Findings on epic-owned branches route back to `@co`; findings on child technical work route back to `@imp`.

Never mix roles in one session. Fresh context prevents scope contamination and authority confusion.
### Codex Skill and Workflow Mapping

| Antigravity surface | Codex surface |
|---|---|
| Agent `@co` | Top-level skill [`pgmcp-co`](.agents/skills/pgmcp-co/SKILL.md) |
| Agent `@imp` | Top-level skill [`pgmcp-imp`](.agents/skills/pgmcp-imp/SKILL.md) |
| Agent `@qa` | Top-level skill [`pgmcp-qa`](.agents/skills/pgmcp-qa/SKILL.md) |
| Agent `@research` | Top-level skill [`pgmcp-research`](.agents/skills/pgmcp-research/SKILL.md) |
| Workflow `create-issue` | Internal `pgmcp-co` workflow reference |
| Workflow `start-issue` | Internal `pgmcp-co` workflow reference |
| Workflow `end-issue` | Internal `pgmcp-co` workflow reference |
| Workflow `go` | Internal `pgmcp-imp` workflow reference |
| Workflow `start` | Startup contract in this file and the selected role skill |

`.agents/workflows/` is the single procedural source for both Antigravity and Codex. Codex role
skills route to those files as internal workflow references; they are not independently
discoverable Codex skills or slash commands. Do not copy their procedure text into role skills.

### Startup Protocol

Each agent has its own startup protocol defined in its `.agent.md` file and corresponding Codex
role skill. Normal chat sessions call `get_work_context` as the first tool invocation.
`start-issue` and `end-issue` are explicit lifecycle-boundary exceptions that may run their
scripted bootstrap or exit sequence before control returns to a normal
`get_work_context`-first session. `create-issue` is normal coordination work and therefore loads
`get_work_context` first. See:
- [`@co` startup](.agents/rules/co.agent.md)
- [`@imp` startup](.agents/rules/imp.agent.md)
- [`@qa` startup](.agents/rules/qa.agent.md)

### Hand-Over Contract

Use Co → Imp only for child technical delegation. Epic-owned branch review and lifecycle continuation stay with `@co`; QA findings and merge follow-up on those branches route back there.

**Co → Imp hand-over:**
```text
## Co → Imp Hand-over

**Directive**: [what to do]
**Issues in scope**: [#N, #M]
**Priority changes applied**: [yes/no, which labels]
**Next @imp sub-role**: [researcher | planner | implementer | ...]
**Out of scope**: [what not to touch]
```

**Imp → QA hand-over:**
```text
### Scope
- what cycle or task was executed
- what was intentionally kept out of scope

### Files
- changed files grouped by role

### Deliverables
- which authoritative deliverables are now satisfied

### Stop-Go Proof
- exact tests run
- exact gate commands or MCP checks run
- exact outcome
```

## 🏗️ Project Context & Architecture: ypsia

**What it is:** A personal AI coach platform integrating training data (Garmin + others), AI-driven analysis (Gemini via LiteLLM), weekly rhythm planning, nutrition tracking, and meal planning.

### Key Architectural Decisions
- **AI layer:** LiteLLM (provider-agnostic, BYOK), Gemini as primary provider
- **AI UX:** Streaming responses — feels like a real coach/sparring partner
- **Data privacy:** User-controlled data scope per AI session (hard filter before prompt injection)
- **Data strategy:** Hybrid RAG + direct injection (structured queries → SQL, open analysis → RAG)
- **Stack:** Python/FastAPI backend, React/Vite frontend, SQLite (local-first)
- **Primary data source:** Garmin export (FIT files), extensible to other sources

### Epics Roadmap (Milestone Log)
| Epic | Domain | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| Epic 1 — Data Fundament | Garmin import, normalization, storage | Garmin import, normalization, storage |
| Epic 2 — AI Layer | LiteLLM integration, streaming, data scope | LiteLLM integration, streaming, data scope |
| Epic 3 — Weekly Planner | Fixed rhythms, training scheduling, recovery logic | Fixed rhythms, training scheduling, recovery logic |
| Epic 4 — Training Analysis | Dashboards, trends, AI analysis | Dashboards, trends, AI analysis |
| Epic 5 — Nutrition & Meals | Logging, menus, shopping lists, nutritional advice | Logging, menus, shopping lists, nutritional advice |
| Epic 6 — AI Coach Interface | Chat UI, weekly briefing, proactive insights | Chat UI, weekly briefing, proactive insights |

**Git model:** Simple. No milestones. Epics act as milestone-like log. `main` is always stable.
