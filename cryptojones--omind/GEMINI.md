# AGENTS.md — orientation for AI agents working on omind

Read this before changing code. It covers what a contributor doc can't: the
invariants that break *silently*, the current state of in-flight work, and the
dead ends someone already walked down.

For dev setup, the four quality gates, the module map, SemVer rules, and PR
conventions, see **[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)** — this file does not
repeat them.

## The one-paragraph version

omind gives AI agents durable memory as **plain Markdown notes** in an Obsidian
vault, replicated peer-to-peer over git, exposed to agents through a local MCP
server (`omind node`) and enforced by a hook-based guard. Roughly a third of the
repo is memory; the rest is agent enforcement (`guard.py`, `policy.py`,
`verify.py`), fleet provisioning (`provision.py`, `agents.py`), and mesh
replication (`mesh.py`, `merge.py`). Know which subsystem you are in.

## Invariants — violate these and something breaks quietly

1. **The Markdown files are the source of truth.** Indexes, caches, and vectors
   are derived and disposable. Anything derived lives in the state dir
   (`paths.state_dir()`), never in the vault: vault contents are committed and
   mesh-synced, so a derived file there would replicate machine-specific junk
   fleet-wide.
2. **Retrieval fails open.** Every layer of search returns `None` on any problem
   and the caller falls back to the older, dumber path. A missing model, a
   corrupt index, a locked database, a missing FTS5 build — all degrade search;
   none may break it. Test the failure branch, not just the happy one.
3. **Multi-note writes go through `omind.txn`.** One note at a time is already
   atomic (same-dir temp + `os.replace`). Two or more is not, and a crash
   between them used to leave partial state with no way back. Any new operation
   that writes several notes must journal its pre-images through
   `txn.Transaction` under `store.write_lock()`, or it reintroduces the gap
   `omind recover` exists to close. Recovery refuses to overwrite a note edited
   after the crash — that edit is newer than the pre-image.
4. **All note writes go through `OmiStore`** (`notes.upsert_note` for external
   writers) — flock, atomic rename, Lamport `Rev:` stamping, soft delete.
   Deletes archive (`Disabled: true`); only `omind mesh purge` truly removes.
5. **`OmiStore.safe_name` guards every read and write.** Path traversal must stay
   impossible; there are tests enforcing this. Don't route around them.
6. **`store.py` stays framework-free.** No FastAPI, no MCP. The CLI and the web
   app both build on it.
7. **Credential notes are de-prioritised** in search and in the gate's
   suggestions unless the query is itself about credentials
   (`retrieve._CREDENTIAL_PENALTY`). The gate must never steer an agent into the
   secrets notes. This is load-bearing, not decoration.
8. **No MCP tool may return unbounded output.** Every list-shaped tool pages
   (`limit`, `offset`, `total`, `has_more`) via `server._page`. `list-notes` once
   returned ~90,800 tokens in a single result; `tests/test_server.py::
   test_every_list_tool_is_bounded` exists so a new tool cannot regress that.
9. **Reserved files are not memories.** `index.md` and `Memory Template.md` are
   scaffolding; reading one does *not* clear the consult gate
   (`paths.NON_CONSULT_FILENAMES` — an anti-dodge measure, issue #109).

## Handoff: the 2026-08-27 multi-agent review (shipped)

The 2026-07-24 retrieval handoff below is history: `feat/hybrid-retrieval-token-budgets`
landed long ago, and #167–#178 all shipped (see BACKLOG.md). Current state at this
writing: **v8.8.0 on `main`**, 1,000+ tests + ruff + mypy strict green. Trust
**BACKLOG.md + CHANGELOG.md** for what's open — not older handoffs.

### What changed and why

A nine-slice multi-agent review (report:
[docs/reviews/2026-08-27-multi-agent-review.md](docs/reviews/2026-08-27-multi-agent-review.md))
found 35 issues; all are fixed in the working tree. The classes worth remembering:

- **Locking is total now, and the pattern is uniform.** Any read-modify-write of a
  small state file (gate sentinels, re-close/off-topic counters, `loop_guard.json`,
  `node.json`, `backup.json`, harness settings.json) goes through
  `filelock.exclusive()` on a SIBLING `.lock` path — never on the data file itself,
  because the data file is replaced atomically and a flock on a replaced inode
  protects nothing. Apply this to any new state file.
- **Optimistic concurrency is the coordination story.** `upsert_note` captures the
  version BEFORE reading existing fields; checkpoint/okf/consolidate pin versions;
  `edit-note` without a token answers `concurrency: "unverified"` instead of
  silently last-write-wins.
- **Deletion yields to newer edits.** Purge tombstones carry the purge-time Rev;
  `_apply_tombstones` keeps and reports a note whose live Rev dominates it.
- **Merge LWW losses are visible in the vault** (`merge-lww` tag), not just daemon
  stderr. If you touch `merge.py`, keep scalar losses tagged.
- **The index stores the encoder IDENTITY** (`embed.model_identity`: name +
  embedding-space digest), not the model name — same name/different snapshot used
  to mix vector spaces silently. Refresh also BACKFILLS chunks missing vectors.
- **Self-update pins the resolved commit SHA**, never the mutable tag, and records
  the previous version for `omind self-update --rollback`.
- **Enforcement hardening:** `guard reset` is compliance-logged (`gate-reset`);
  freshness recorded at PreToolUse is RETRACTED on PostToolUse failure; the
  verifier prompt fences untrusted material and parses verdicts by token; Layer E
  uses the strict `policy.opt_in_satisfied` matcher.

### Things that will bite you (still true)

- Retrieval/enforcement fail OPEN — every new path must degrade, never raise into
  the agent. `SearchIndex.search` now blanket-catches; keep it that way.
- Recency only re-ranks matches (`test_recency_only_reorders_matches...`).
- The index doesn't strip fences from `[[wikilinks]]`; lint.py does.
- `link_targets()` preserves case.
- Never mutate a cached `NoteSummary`; use `dataclasses.replace`.
- `mesh purge` requires `--yes` (or a TTY confirm) — keep it gated.
- `read-note` caps bodies (20k default / 65k hard) — keep it bounded (invariant 8).

### Where to pick up

The feature roadmap (agent identity/attribution, a usefulness feedback loop,
sleep-time consolidation, write-time dedup, scoped writes) is Part 2 of the review
report — none of it is started. `omind` is still not on PyPI (#267 needs the
user's PyPI account/credentials).

## Working agreements

- **BACKLOG.md and the GitHub Issues tab are two views of one list.** File an
  issue for every backlog line and link it both ways; check the box when it
  ships. Both had drifted badly before 2026-07-24 (every "Open" item was already
  closed upstream) — don't let that happen again.
- **Two mirrors:** GitHub and Codeberg, kept at the same `main`. Commits land on
  both.
- **Commit/push only when asked.** Branch off `main` (`feat/`, `fix/`, `docs/`,
  `chore/`, `refactor/`), conventional-commit subjects.
- **Docs carry the footer** (`*Proudly Made in Nebraska. Go Big Red! 🌽
  <https://xkcd.com/2347/>*`); the README carries the centred banner version.
- **Report honestly.** If a gate fails, say so with the output. If you skipped
  part of the scope, say which part and why — see how #174 and #177 were left
  open rather than half-done.
