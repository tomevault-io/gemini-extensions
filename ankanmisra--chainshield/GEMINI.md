# AGENTS.md

Project conventions and pointers for AI coding agents (and humans) working in this repo.

## What this project is

ChainShield Agent: a policy-bound risk gate for onchain treasuries and wallets. The server accepts a transaction intent, evaluates it against deterministic rules plus (eventually) simulation and LLM reflection, and returns one of three verdicts: `ALLOW`, `REQUIRE_HUMAN_CONFIRMATION`, or `BLOCK`. Every decision is appended to an incident timeline.

Built for ETHGlobal OpenAgents 2026. Sponsor integrations planned: 0G (storage + inference), KeeperHub (remediation playbooks), Gensyn AXL (multi-agent mesh).

## Tech stack

This hackathon submission is **TypeScript on Bun, end to end**. There is no Rust code and no Solidity contracts in this repo. A Rust + Solidity port lives in the post-hackathon roadmap (see `docs/architecture.md` "Future direction" section) but no agent should write `.rs` or `.sol` files in this repo without an explicit user request.

- Runtime: Bun 1.3 (single tool for install, run, test, build)
- Language: TypeScript with strict mode (`noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, ESM with `.js` import suffix)
- HTTP: Fastify 5 + `@fastify/cors`
- Validation: Zod (boundary only — internal code trusts typed values)
- Onchain client: `ethers` v6 (peer dep of the 0G storage SDK)
- 0G persistence: `@0gfoundation/0g-storage-ts-sdk`
- Frontend: Astro 6 at `web/` (vanilla TS, no React/Vue)
- Tests: `bun:test` (Jest-compatible)
- Containerization: Docker (multi-stage on `oven/bun:1.3-alpine`)

## Run, test, build

```sh
bun install                # install deps from bun.lock
bun run dev                # start risk-gate server with watch on 127.0.0.1:8787
bun run start              # production-style boot (no watch)
bun test                   # 114 specs across 13 files
bun run test:coverage      # v8 coverage report
bun run typecheck          # tsc --noEmit, must exit 0
bun run build              # bundle to ./dist/server.js
bun run start:bundle       # run the bundled output
bun run clean              # remove dist/, coverage/, .tsbuildinfo
bun run demo               # four-scene CLI runner against the live server
```

Docker path:

```sh
docker compose up --build  # builds and runs on host port 8787
```

## Where things live

- `src/core/` — types, Zod schemas, policy service, decision engine, EVM selector helpers
- `src/memory/` — `Store` interface, `InMemoryStore`, `ZeroGStore` (0G anchor adapter)
- `src/simulator/` — `Simulator` interface, `HeuristicSimulator` (ERC-20 calldata decode + balance projection)
- `src/playbooks/` — `PlaybookRunner` interface, `KeeperHubRunner`, notification channels
- `src/risk-gate/` — Fastify app and server entrypoint
- `src/cli/demo.ts` — `bun run demo` four-scene CLI
- `tests/` — `bun:test` specs covering engine rules, policy service, the API, simulator, playbooks, 0G store, anchor surfacing
- `web/` — Astro 6 frontend (components, lib modules, pages, styles)
- `docs/` — architecture, submission, demo script, product story, sponsor research notes
- `scripts/` — `kh.sh` (KeeperHub helper), `dev.sh` (parallel server + frontend dev)
- `.claude/skills/` — reusable agent skills for repeated tasks. Note: `rust-backend-style/`, `solidity-contracts/`, and `sponsor-wiring/` describe the post-hackathon Rust port, not the current code.

## Conventions (TypeScript)

### TypeScript code style

- Strict TypeScript. `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` is on, so always handle `undefined` from `arr[i]` and `Map.get`.
- ESM only. Imports of local files use the `.js` extension (Node ESM convention; Bun and `tsc` both honor it).
- No default exports for app code.
- Prefer interfaces for public shapes, type aliases for unions and primitives.
- Validate at the boundary (HTTP body, env, untrusted JSON) with Zod, then trust the typed value internally.
- Keep error messages user-facing; the Fastify error handler already formats Zod errors as 400s.
- One interface per behaviour seam (`Store`, `Simulator`, `PlaybookRunner`, `NotificationChannel`); keep concrete adapters substitutable.

### Tests

- Co-located test data in `tests/helpers.ts` (canonical addresses, intent and policy factories).
- One feature per `it()`. Assertions on the verdict, the matched rules, and the risk score together; do not assert just one of them.
- Inject `now()` and `idGen()` into `DecisionEngine` and `PolicyService` for deterministic timestamps and ids.
- Do not mock the in-memory store; use a fresh `InMemoryStore` per test.

### Commits

- One-line subjects when possible. Imperative mood (`add`, `fix`, `refactor`, never `added`/`adding`).
- Lowercase first letter unless it is a proper noun.
- Group related changes into a single commit; split unrelated work.
- Never amend a pushed commit unless the user asks for it.

### Branches

- Feature branches: `feature/<short-name>`.
- Default base for PRs: `main`.
- CI on every PR and push to `main` runs `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: frozen-lockfile installs (root + `web/`), `bun run typecheck`, `bun test`, `bun run build:web`, and an emoji-bytes scan. The Bun version is pinned in `.bun-version`.

## Decision-engine contract (do not break)

The engine is the heart of the product. Keep these invariants when changing it:

1. The verdict ladder is `BLOCK > REQUIRE_HUMAN_CONFIRMATION > ALLOW`. A rule may only escalate, never de-escalate.
2. `forbiddenSelectors` is checked before any other rule and short-circuits to `BLOCK` with risk 95.
3. `maxTransferEth` and `approvalCapByToken` produce `BLOCK` with risk >= 90.
4. `maxDailyOutflowEth` reads the timeline; only non-blocked decisions count toward the rolling sum.
5. `allowedDestinations` downgrades `ALLOW` to `REQUIRE_HUMAN_CONFIRMATION` (risk 60). It does not upgrade to `BLOCK` on its own.
6. Every decision is persisted via `Store.appendDecision` exactly once.
7. `reasons[]` is human-readable English; `rulesMatched[]` is machine-readable rule keys. Keep them in sync.

## Things to avoid

- Do not add a new sponsor adapter without an interface in front of it. The `Store` interface is the template: keep concrete clients (e.g. `ZeroGStore`, `KeeperHubRunner`) substitutable.
- Do not bake API keys or RPC URLs into source. Read them from `process.env` (see `.env.example`).
- Do not add backwards-compatibility shims. The repo is pre-release; rename freely.
- Do not write to disk from the server process. State belongs in the `Store` (today in-memory, tomorrow 0G).
- Do not introduce a UI build step. The browser UI is a single static HTML file served by Fastify; keep it that way until a real framework is justified.
- Do not use emojis anywhere in source, tests, docs, commit messages, PR descriptions, or UI text.

## Skills available

Project-local skills live in `.claude/skills/`. Invoke them via the `Skill` tool when a task matches their description.

Active for the current TypeScript codebase:

- `selector-decode`: when you see a 4-byte calldata selector (`0x` + 8 hex) and need to know which function it identifies, or you need to author a forbidden-selector list.
- `policy-author`: when designing a new `Policy` for a wallet or treasury.
- `erc20-attack-patterns`: when reasoning about token approvals, transfers, or related ERC-20 attack vectors.

Roadmap-only (do **not** apply to current code; reference material for the post-hackathon Rust + Solidity port):

- `sponsor-wiring`: Rust crate-level adapter wiring for 0G / KeeperHub / Gensyn AXL.
- `rust-backend-style`: Rust crate layout, error handling, async, serde shapes, testing patterns.
- `solidity-contracts`: Solidity authoring patterns — `PolicyAnchor`, `EmergencyVault`, custom errors, Foundry tests.

Read the corresponding `SKILL.md` before acting.

## Environment

`.env.example` lists every variable the project may read, grouped by phase. Phase 1 needs none; Phase 2 needs the 0G and KeeperHub credentials.

## Out of scope

- Production deployment, CI/CD, multi-tenant auth, observability stack. This is a hackathon prototype.
- Any chain other than 0G Galileo (testnet, chain id 16602) for the demo. The schema accepts any chain id, but routing logic is single-chain for now.
