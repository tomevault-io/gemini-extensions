## Project

Axiomander is a Hoare-logic verification pipeline for Python.

Users annotate Python functions with `@requires`, `@ensures`, `@invariant` decorators.
The pipeline translates these into weakest-precondition proof obligations in Coq.
SMT solvers clear the easy goals; an LLM oracle generates proofs for the rest.

## Design Philosophy

Axiomander aims to be **the gold standard for verification systems**.
Every architectural decision must be *the right way* from the ground up.
No half-baked approaches. No shortcuts that paper over a fundamental mismatch.
If a feature requires two representations, unify them. If a type system is
incomplete, extend it fully rather than encoding around the gaps.
The goal is not to pass tests — it's to build a sound, composable,
and extensible verification stack that holds up under real-world use.

**Ground rules:**
- Python's runtime type system must be reflected in the `value` type.
  Coercion rules must follow Python's semantics (float+int→float, etc.).
- Contracts are plain Python — `assert` statements in the function body (zero imports,
  zero decorators) or an `axiomander:` docstring block with `requires:`/`ensures:`.
  The assertion_finder classifies `assert` by position; the docstring parser
  converts Nagini-style contracts into the same IR.
- **Contracts are never weakened to pass a test.** If a prover can't handle a
  contract, the fix is in the prover — not in the contract. A failing test with
  an honest `xfail` documents the gap; a "passing" test with a watered-down
  contract hides it. The contract is the specification; the prover serves it,
  not the other way around.
- The WP calculus is the single source of truth, proven sound in Coq.
- Frame conditions are explicit, enforced, and derive from the callee's
  declared `reads`/`writes`, not from implementation details.
- `simpl`/`cbn` reduction is controlled — Fixpoint reduction must not
  expand structural comparisons (`In`, `clobber`) before lemmas fire.
- Immutable values (VList, VTuple, VDict) are structural, like Dafny's
  `seq` and F*'s `list`. Mutable operations (append, pop) work on a
  separate heap representation that parallels the value.
- Every new type or operation must have negative tests that demonstrate
  the verifier catches violations, not just passes trivially. Negative
  tests prove the system isn't "proving everything."

### Open Architecture Decisions

**Per-Callee Frame Lemmas — IN PROGRESS.** CCall frame conditions produce
a `forall x, ~ In x (target :: writes) -> ...` subgoal that causes WP term
blowup and compiled-Ltac pattern matching problems.  Solution: generate one
Coq lemma per (callee, frame-variable) pair at the Python IR level.  Each
lemma is trivial (`apply wp_ccall_frame`).  The caller proof uses `apply
lemma_name` instead of matching the general forall.  Design at
[`docs/frame-lemmas.md`](docs/frame-lemmas.md).

**Lemmas generate correctly;** remaining work is wiring them into the proof
so each `apply lemma_name` fires independently, producing residual state on
failure.

### Staged Proof Engineering — Assessment

A gap analysis against [`staged_proof_engineering_guide.md`](staged_proof_engineering_guide.md):

| Principle | Current | Gap |
|-----------|---------|-----|
| Small named obligations | Per-function theorems + VCG lemmas | CCall frames are one `forall`; per-variable lemmas being built |
| Durable artifacts | Binary cache per function | No tactic trace, no residual goals, no per-obligation dirs |
| Mechanical tactic ladder | `wp_reduce` → `wp_prove` | No trace of which tactic fired/succeeded/failed |
| Residual goal capture | Raw `coqc` error string | No structured residual state with hypotheses |
| Narrow LLM tasks | Prompt gives context | Doesn't include residual goal with hypotheses |
| Multi-level caching | Function-level hash | No per-obligation, per-stage caching |
| Failure classification | `UNPROVED/COUNTEREXAMPLE/LEVEL*` | Doesn't distinguish "bug" vs "missing lemma" vs "weak automation" |

**Root cause:** `wp_prove.` is a single monolithic tactic. When it fails we
lose all intermediate proof state. The fix is to break proofs into staged
named obligations that can fail independently.

### Next Steps (priority order)

1. **Wire frame lemmas into proofs** — replace the general `forall` frame
   subgoal with `apply inc_frame_a. apply inc_frame_b. ...` per variable.
   Each `apply` can fail independently with its own residual state.

2. **Staged proof output** — generate proofs as sequences of named stages
   (preconditions, frame lemmas, postcondition) instead of `wp_prove.` only.

3. **Residual goal capture** — when a stage fails, save the goal state
   with hypotheses to a `.v` fragment for coq-lsp / LLM consumption.

4. **Tactic trace** — log which tactic fired, which subgoal it produced,
   and whether it succeeded or failed. Feed into caching.

5. **Failure classification** — distinguish "weak invariant" from
   "missing lemma" from "arithmetic too complex for lia/SMT."

**Loop predicates — RESOLVED.** Predicates containing loops are handled via
postcondition-inlining: the predicate is verified as a standalone function, its
semantic postcondition (guarded by `implies(result == 1, property)`) is extracted,
and at call sites in contracts, the postcondition is inlined with `result → 1`
substitution via AST transformation. This is a variant of CCall-based expansion:
the predicate must carry proper postcondition contracts using `implies`, and the
linter substitutes callee args + `result → 1` at the AST level — no string
manipulation. Pure expression predicates (single return statement) are inlined
directly. Predicates without postconditions are rejected.

## Code Conventions

### Coq
- Use `From Stdlib Require Import` prefix (Rocq 9.x)
- File names: PascalCase.v (matching module name)
- Proof style: short, structured proofs using stdlib tactics
- `Admitted` for WIP lemmas, never leave stray `Admitted` in committed proofs
- **Debug proofs with coqtop, not by staring at error messages.**  When
  a tactic fails with "No applicable tactic", run `coqtop -R _build/default/coq Imp`
  and step through the proof one command at a time with `Show.` to inspect
  the goal state.  The error text alone cannot tell you what the goal looks like
  after reduction — you need to see the actual terms.
- **Prefer coq-lsp for interactive proof development.**  The coq-lsp MCP
  provides goal inspection (`coq_open_goals`), speculative tactic execution
  (`coq_try_tactic`), term checking (`coq_check_term`), and lemma search
  (`coq_search`) without leaving the editor session.  It is strictly better
  than raw `coqtop` for stepping through proofs.  SESSION RULE: always
  use coq-lsp tools for interactive Coq debugging before falling back to
  `coqtop`.
- **Internal prover evaluation note (OPEN).**  The pipeline currently uses
  `coqtop` subprocesses (`py/axiomander/oracle/coq_session.py:22`) and `coqc` for
  validation.  coq-lsp may be a better foundation for the internal proof
  engine — it provides structured goal inspection, incremental checking,
  and could replace the heuristic `coq_session.py` with goal-directed
  search.  Evaluate and migrate if it simplifies the proof search.
- **Coercion normalisation in compiled Ltac.**  If a source pattern uses
  `(ls (lupd …)) ?x`, the compiled `.vo` will normalise the coercion away and
  store `lupd ?s ?x ?v ?x` instead.  The compiled pattern then cannot match the
  internal representation that still has the `ls` wrapper.  Prefer explicit
  `lget` patterns (which are definitions, not coercions) or accept that
  cross-coercion matching needs hand-written proofs per function.

### OCaml
- Library modules: `snake_case.ml` with `snake_case.mli` interface
- Use dune `(library ...)` for shared code, `(executable ...)` for entry points
- Warning 32 suppression allowed in library modules: `[@@@warning "-32"]`

### Python (when present)
- Decorators in `py/contracts/`
- Use `ast` module for WP transformation (no third-party parsers)
- Type hints on all public functions
- **Never use regex on parse-tree strings.** When you need to extract names or analyze structure, walk the AST or IR tree — it has the grammar's semantics built in. Regex on Coq/IMP strings is fragile: `re.findall(r'\b(\w+)\b', "asZ (s x)")` extracts `asZ` as a "variable". The IR's `Var(name='x')` node tells you `x` is a variable without false positives.
- **Never use UTF-8 characters in Python source or docstrings.** Em dashes, smart quotes, arrows, and other non-ASCII characters cause syntax errors or silent encoding issues. Use ASCII only: `->` not `→`, `--` not `—`, straight quotes only.

## Key Design Decisions

1. **IMP as intermediate language**: We don't prove properties about arbitrary Python. We map a verified subset (assignments, conditionals, loops) to IMP and prove at that level.
2. **WP over VC**: We use weakest-precondition calculus (Dijkstra-style), not forward VCG. Simpler, more compositional.
3. **SMT then LLM**: SMT handles what it can handle (linear arithmetic, bitvectors). LLM is the fallback, not the first choice.
4. **Coq is the trust base**: The WP calculus is proven sound in Coq. The Python→IMP translator is trusted (or extractable from Coq later).
5. **Vanilla Python contracts**: Contracts use Python `assert` statements or
   `axiomander:` docstring blocks. The user's code stays dependency-free;
   the MCP server does the heavy lifting.

## Proof Pipeline (3 Tiers)

```
Goal
  │
  ├─ Level 1: Ltac (wp_reduce, lia, reflexivity)
  │     Handles: structural WP unfolding, state simplification,
  │              simple arithmetic, string equality
  │     When to use: always run first; clears ~80% of goals
  │
  ├─ Level 2: SMT (coq-hammer → cvc4 / eprover)
  │     Handles: pure Z arithmetic, first-order logic,
  │              linear inequalities, boolean combinations
  │     When to use: after wp_reduce, on remaining arithmetic goals
  │     Limitations: Z.of_nat, nth, length are opaque to ATPs
  │
  └─ Level 3: LLM oracle
        Handles: loop invariants, inductive proofs,
                 non-linear arithmetic, complex data structure reasoning
        When to use: goals that need induction or deep lemma chains
```

## Hammer Usage (Level 2)

### Quick check
```coq
From Hammer Require Import Hammer.
Goal ...  hammer.
```

### When hammer times out
```coq
Set Hammer ATPLimit 60.       (* default: 20s *)
Set Hammer ReconstrLimit 30.   (* default: 5s *)
```

### When ATPs find a proof but reconstruction fails
Hammer prints the dependency list. Use it to write the manual proof:
```coq
(* Hammer says: CVC4 succeeded, dependencies: Z.sub_succ_l, Z.lt_succ_diag_r, IHn *)
Proof.
  induction n; rewrite Nat2Z.inj_succ; [lia | apply Z.lt_succ_diag_r].
Qed.
```

### Key pattern: case-split before hammering
Hammer never performs induction. Always `destruct`/`induction` first,
then rewrite opaque functions (`Z.of_nat`, `nth`, `length`) before `hammer`:
```coq
Goal forall n, Z.of_nat n - 1 < Z.of_nat n.
Proof.
  induction n.          (* hammer can't do this *)
  - hammer.             (* base case: pure Z, hammer handles it *)
  - rewrite Nat2Z.inj_succ. hammer.  (* convert to Z before hammer *)
Qed.
```

### Where hammer gets stuck
- `Z.of_nat`, `nth`, `length` — opaque to ATPs; rewrite away first
- Classical proofs — can't be reconstructed intuitionistically
- Goals needing induction — must be done manually
- `dependent destruction` / `inversion` on complex inductive types

### Provers available
```
eprover  ✓  — first-order logic (system package)
cvc4     ✓  — SMT arithmetic (apt install cvc4)
z3_tptp  ✗  — needs Z3 ≥ 4.12 built from source (optional)
vampire  ✗  — not installed (optional)
```

## Automation Tactics

### wp_reduce (Level 1 — structural)
```coq
Ltac wp_reduce :=
  unfold wp, upd; simpl; try reflexivity.
```
Clears: assignment WP, state lookups, string equality, trivial arithmetic.

### wp_reduce + lia (Level 1 — arithmetic)
```coq
Ltac wp_finish := wp_reduce; try lia.
```
Clears: linear arithmetic, inequalities, conditional branch goals.

### hammer (Level 2 — SMT)
```coq
From Hammer Require Import Hammer.
Set Hammer ATPLimit 60.
```
Dispatches to cvc4 (arithmetic) and eprover (first-order) in parallel.
Best used after wp_reduce has cleared the structural layer.

## Dependencies

- OCaml ≥ 5.2.0
- Coq (Rocq) ≥ 9.0
- dune ≥ 3.17
- Dream (for web server — optional, needs system deps)
- coq-hammer (for SMT integration)
- Python ≥ 3.10 (for py/ side)

## Session Rules

1. **Commit often.** After each meaningful unit of work (a feature, a bugfix, a test pass), create a commit. Long sessions accumulate changes that are easily lost. Commit messages should be concise and describe the "why."
2. **Never `git checkout --` on multiple files.** That reverts everything indiscriminately. Instead, use `git checkout -- <single-file>` or `git stash` to preserve context. If a file is corrupted by a bad edit, restore only that file.
3. **Verify tests pass after each change.** Run `uv run pytest test_pipeline.py -q` before declaring a unit of work done.
4. **Check `git status` before destructive git operations.** Know what you're about to lose.
5. **Never change toolchain versions without explicit permission.** Do not `opam pin`, `opam install` a different version, downgrade, or upgrade dune/rocq/ocaml without asking first. Version changes cascade through the opam switch and can remove or break other packages.
6. **Never alter the rocq standard library.** Do not delete, modify, or create files/symlinks in `~/.opam/rocq-*/lib/coq/`. The stdlib is a managed installation; debugging should focus on the project's own configuration.
