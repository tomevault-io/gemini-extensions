# AGENTS.md — cc-remote

Guidance for Codex (and human contributors) working in this repo. User-facing setup/run docs live in [README.md](README.md) / [README_en.md](README_en.md).

## What this is
Self-hosted remote control for Claude Code and Codex: a phone/browser drives a
local `claude` or `codex` session through a WebSocket relay. Two independent links:
- **model link** — the local CLI → whatever its own settings/authentication point
  at. cc-remote never touches model credentials or the model API.
- **control link** (this repo) — client ⇄ relay ⇄ wrapper ⇄ Claude Agent SDK /
  Codex app-server. Native CLI ownership is detected and mirrored separately.

## Deployment

The repository skill is
[`.agents/skills/cc-remote-deploy/SKILL.md`](.agents/skills/cc-remote-deploy/SKILL.md).
Use it for deployment, upgrade, verification and recovery requests; agents that
do not auto-discover repository skills must read it explicitly.

The repository-owned deployment procedure is [`deploy/README.md`](deploy/README.md).
Read its automation contract and the relevant installation path completely
before any deploy, redeploy, recovery, verification, or rollback. Do not depend
on out-of-tree instructions, and do not add an operator's host aliases,
usernames, IPs, domains, home directories, or credentials to this repository.
Resolve that inventory from the environment the operator placed in scope.

Use one tested source snapshot or one set of release artifacts for all protocol
tiers, stage and validate before touching live services, preserve external
configuration and private state, and use the repository's immutable activation
transactions. A dropped SSH/control connection is an unknown result: inspect
the original transaction and live state before deciding whether a retry is
safe. Deployment is complete only after protocol/build identity, service
stability, public health, and expected Wrapper connectivity are verified.
For Codex Code, also follow `deploy/README.md`'s shared-control-plane acceptance:
verify each account's daily CLI and Wrapper connect to the same official
app-server, not a private stdio fallback. Do not force takeover or kill a live
CLI to satisfy deployment checks.
After core deployment checks, follow the optional Codex App checkpoint in that
guide: detect an installed App on an in-scope desktop, ask before attaching it,
and keep a decline or pending answer separate from deployment success. App
attachment and optional App-control MCP tools are separate user choices.

## Critical constraints / traps
- **Drain footgun**: after `ClaudeSDKClient.interrupt()`, the SDK does NOT kill
  the session — the current turn's stream still emits a terminal
  `ResultMessage(subtype="error_during_execution")`. You MUST keep consuming
  `receive_response()` until that ResultMessage before the next `query()`, else
  stale deltas from the interrupted turn bleed into the new turn. The wrapper
  handles this structurally: one `async for` per turn runs through the interrupt
  to the terminal ResultMessage; state only returns to `idle` (and the next
  query is only accepted) after that break. Reject-while-busy prevents a second
  query racing the drain.
- **cwd must match resume**: a session's jsonl lives at
  `~/.claude/projects/<cwd-with-/-as->/<uuid>.jsonl`. `ClaudeAgentOptions.cwd`
  MUST equal the original session's cwd or `resume` can't find it.
- **SDK pinned to `claude-agent-sdk==0.2.151`**: message-type shapes and the
  interrupt/drain contract can shift between patch versions. Re-run the
  interrupt+drain verification after any upgrade (`SdkHandle.preflight()` guards
  the exact verified patch at startup).
- **Claude Code is the user's daily CLI, not the SDK bundle**: Claude Code
  `>=2.1.258` is required and checked before a Claude session starts. The wrapper
  defaults `CLAUDE_BIN` to `~/.local/bin/claude` and passes that path explicitly
  to the SDK. An empty value keeps this default; only another absolute path may
  override it. Keep that CLI updated and signed in before starting the wrapper.
- **`include_partial_messages`** is a `ClaudeAgentOptions` field (set at
  construction, not on `query()`). Streaming events arrive as `StreamEvent`
  (`.event` = raw Anthropic API stream-event dict) — NOT
  `SDKPartialAssistantMessage` (doesn't exist in 0.2.151). Extract
  `content_block_delta` → `delta.text` from `StreamEvent.event`.
- **tool_use is batched, not streamed**: emit one `tool_use` event from the
  assembled `AssistantMessage` (full `input`), never as JSON-fragment deltas.
  Text deltas still stream live via `StreamEvent`.
- **Claude only — don't set `setting_sources=[]` for Code**: legacy single-account
  Code intentionally loads `~/.claude/settings.json`. Explicit account profiles
  keep the real HOME, clear ambient account selectors, and use
  `setting_sources=["user"]`. A profile rooted at the real per-user `~/.claude`
  must leave `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` unset, retaining `~/.claude.json` and native
  keychain identity; other roots set it explicitly. Setting it to `~/.claude`
  changes the account file to `~/.claude/.claude.json`. Project/local settings
  may contain provider env or
  auth helpers and must not participate in an account-isolated child. Never pass
  the selected profile's complete settings file through `--settings`: that
  promotes every user setting above project/local precedence. Never parse or
  copy account credentials into cc-remote state. Single-account behavior stays
  native; Work is the deliberate exception with one wrapper-owned policy file,
  `setting_sources=[]`, and safe mode.
- **Auth is URL-secret-free**: the wrapper uses `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
  at WS upgrade. Web clients POST `LOGIN_PASSWORD` to `/api/login` and receive a
  short-lived HttpOnly/SameSite cookie; `/ws` enforces exact `PUBLIC_ORIGIN`.
  When `ALLOW_PRIVATE_ORIGINS=1`, the only additional origins are literal
  private/loopback IPs on `RELAY_PORT`, and their scheme/host/port must match
  the effective request target. Cookie `Secure` follows that trusted request
  transport, never the caller's Origin. Uvicorn trusts forwarded transport
  metadata only from loopback Caddy. Never put tokens in URLs or protocol
  message bodies; logging redacts token/password fields.
- **Protocol version gate**: current wire protocol v66 is declared by
  `PROTOCOL_VERSION` in both `protocol.py` and `web/src/protocol.ts`.
  `deserialize` hard-rejects a version mismatch, and
  `_Base` is `extra="forbid"`, so ANY protocol change must be deployed to all
  three tiers together (wrapper + relay + web) and the relay restarted — the
  relay imports `protocol.py` and drops frames it can't parse.
- **Device scope is an authorization boundary**: one relay can serve multiple
  wrappers. Every browser command, event, push subscription, and pairing token
  is scoped by `machine_id`; a credential for one enrolled device must never be
  accepted for another. Keep `cc_remote/device.py`, `relay/devices.py`, relay
  routing, and the Web device selector aligned when this contract changes.
- **Remote Viewer serves static pages, not arbitrary LAN services**: read
  `docs/remote-viewer.md` before changing its resource or origin boundary. Keep
  Bridge pages in opaque HTTP-sandboxed frames (never `allow-same-origin`),
  secrets out of URLs/JSON, and binary transfers on `/ws/viewer` (Wrapper) /
  `/ws/viewer-client` (browser Cookie + exact Origin), never on chat/replay.
  Optional Isolated mode uses per-preview origins and a `__Host-` main HTTPS
  cookie; default Bridge preserves the existing cookie. Home-page discovery is
  enabled by default (`CC_REMOTE_VIEWER_HOME_PREVIEW=0` opts out): only explicit
  HTML references or device-verified Python static listeners create private,
  session-associated publications. Never crawl home, add automatic entries to
  the global catalog, infer ownership from a private IP alone, follow symlinks,
  start an engine/service, or fetch an arbitrary private URL. Preserve manual
  publications and FD-based project/resource boundaries.
- **Multi-session routing key**: the wrapper runs a POOL of resident sessions
  (`WrapperMachine.sessions: dict[key, SessionContext]`, cap
  `MAX_CONCURRENT_SESSIONS`). `ctx.key` is the routing identity = the real cc sid
  once known, else `tmp-<uuid>`. Every emit stamps `sid = ctx.session_id or
  ctx.key`, so a brand-new session's pre-capture frames route deterministically
  (never leak into the focused runtime). Keep `ctx.key` in sync with the pool
  dict key on every re-key.
- **Focus vs re-key (don't conflate)**: switching the viewed session is
  `SessionFocus` (focus only, no disconnect — the previous session keeps
  streaming). A new session capturing its real id mid-turn is `SessionRekey`
  (rename tmp-key→sid), which moves focus ONLY if the client was already viewing
  the temp key. Emitting SessionFocus on id-capture = focus-steal by background
  sessions.
- **Session cwd migration is in-place** (protocol v27): only an idle Codex Code
  session may move. A cold session is first resumed without changing focus;
  then resume the same native thread id under `SessionContext.query_lock`,
  preserve its wrapper-owned deferred queue, and emit `SessionMigrated` without
  changing focus. The target must already be an absolute directory; reconnect
  the old cwd before reporting a failed move. Persist the accepted cwd in the
  private Codex control store and overlay it on cold resumes/session listings:
  `thread/resume.cwd` is live state and does not rewrite the native catalog
  metadata until a later turn materializes that context.
- **Deferred queries are wrapper-owned** (protocol v25): queue/replace submits
  transfer the complete bounded `Query` to the resident `SessionContext`
  immediately. The wrapper waits for the active managed/spontaneous task's real
  terminal boundary and launches the next item without any browser callback.
  Web/PWA code only renders `QueryQueueState`; never reintroduce an idle-driven
  browser drain. Queued contexts (including a worker's pop-to-preflight window)
  are not eligible for pool eviction or deletion. Full prompt inspection is a
  private one-shot read, and edits atomically replace the prompt under the queue
  lock; never put complete queued payloads in the replay ring.
- **External ownership is engine-specific**: a native Claude CLI owns its
  transcript and is mirrored read-only until it exits or the user explicitly
  takes over. Codex Code sessions use the official app-server; shared-daemon
  CLI activity and private Codex App activity are different ownership sources
  and must not be collapsed into one "external process" heuristic. Ordinary
  shared sessions stay on the daemon; only the guarded oversized-resume path may
  select a newer official private app-server for compatibility.
- **History = local projection + materialized summary pages; reconnect = live-tail replay**
  (protocol v24): IndexedDB paints the browser's last projection before network
  validation. `GetHistory(detail="summary")` returns a small canonical turn page
  (newest four, then `before`/`limit` pagination), while the wrapper's rebuildable
  SQLite index avoids retranslating unchanged transcript/rollout bytes. Heavy
  tools, reasoning, process output and oversized final text stay local until
  `GetTurnDetail` expands that exact turn. The relay remains stateless. A fresh
  hello sends lightweight resident `Snapshot`s; reconnect cursors replay only
  the bounded missing live tail. Source fingerprints invalidate appended pages,
  and rollback explicitly invalidates both server and browser projections. These
  reads never spawn/resume an engine or create a model turn. Codex
  `History.terminal_fences` is a separate bounded lifecycle projection: only a
  real app-server terminal or a source-validated rollout marker may enter it;
  local synthetic failures may not. The browser applies a fence only to its
  exact native turn identity and never changes completion receipts or guesses
  from the last open row.
- **Token-aware residency**: resuming an evicted Claude SDK session may rebuild
  a cold prompt cache, so it only happens on first spawn / re-focus after
  eviction; raising the cap trades RAM for fewer cold re-sends. Codex context is
  owned by the official app-server: cc-remote must page history and use native
  resume/compaction state, never re-upload a whole rollout. Browsing history is
  transcript/rollout I/O and must not create a model turn.

## Module map
- `cc_remote/protocol.py` — pydantic wire schema; all modules depend on it.
  `serialize`/`deserialize` with `v` check; `is_downstream` for seq/buffer.
  Control frames: `SessionFocus` / `SessionRekey` / `GetHistory` / `History` /
  `GetTurnDetail` / `TurnDetail` / `SessionInfo.state`.
- `cc_remote/config.py` — env-driven config (`RelayConfig`, `WrapperConfig`).
- `cc_remote/device.py` — device pairing CLI and persisted per-machine wrapper
  credential.
- `cc_remote/log.py` — JSON logging with token redaction; use `logger("...")`.
- `cc_remote/wrapper/` — `sdk.py` / `stream.py` and `claude_*` implement Claude;
  `codex_handle.py` / `codex_stream.py` / `codex_daemon.py` / `codex_external.py`
  implement the official Codex app-server paths; `codex_lifecycle.py` owns the
  source-bound exact-terminal ledger; `history_store.py` owns the rebuildable
  SQLite projection;
  `machine.py`, `command_router.py`,
  `session_ctx.py`, `ringbuffer.py`, `transport.py`, and `session.py` provide
  the shared session pool, command dispatch, live replay, relay transport, and
  persistence.
- `cc_remote/relay/` — server.py (FastAPI `/ws` + `/api/login` + static), auth.py
  (wrapper bearer + HMAC cookie session), `devices.py` (pairing and enrolled
  machine ownership), `pairing.py` (machine-scoped wrapper/client routing), and
  `forward.py` (bounded per-client queues; slow clients are disconnected without
  silently shedding deltas).
- `web/src/` — `reducer.ts` and `history-merge.ts` own per-session runtime and
  paged history merging; `ws.ts` is the relay client; `protocol.ts` mirrors
  `protocol.py`; `components/DeviceSheet.tsx` manages enrolled machines.

## Commit and PR gate

- Keep every commit coherent and reviewable. Before staging, inspect
  `git status --short --branch` and preserve unrelated user changes. Stage only
  the intended scope, then review `git diff --cached --stat`,
  `git diff --cached`, and `git diff --cached --check`.
- Use an English Conventional Commit subject (`type(scope): summary`). Do not
  add tool prefixes such as `[Codex]` / `[Claude]`, generated-by trailers, or
  `Co-Authored-By` unless the user explicitly requests one.
- For a multiline message, use `git commit -F <message-file>` with exactly one
  blank line after the subject and consecutive direct `- ` bullets. After
  committing, verify the stored message and scope with
  `git log -1 --format=raw --stat`, then recheck
  `git status --short --branch`.
- Before opening or updating **every** PR, run the complete local gate below;
  a docs-only or apparently narrow change does not skip it unless the user
  explicitly accepts that exception. Every command must exit zero. Expected
  platform-defined test skips are allowed, but failures or missing tools must
  be reported rather than silently bypassed.
- Run the Web gate with Node 24 (see `.nvmrc`), matching CI. Newer Node
  browser-like globals must not mask missing browser-environment guards.

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pytest
uvx --from ruff==0.15.13 ruff check cc_remote tests deploy
npm --prefix web run build
npm --prefix web run test:reliability
npm --prefix web run test:history-browser
npm --prefix web run test:viewer
npm --prefix web run lint
bash -n \
  deploy/install.sh \
  deploy/install-relay.sh \
  deploy/install-wrapper.sh \
  deploy/setup-vps.sh
shellcheck -x \
  deploy/install.sh \
  deploy/install-relay.sh \
  deploy/install-wrapper.sh \
  deploy/setup-vps.sh \
  deploy/setup_transaction.sh
git diff --check
```

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` repeats this gate for pushes and PRs. A local pass
  is required before PR publication and does not replace green remote CI before
  merge. These checks are zero-token; do not substitute a live model probe.

## Run / test
```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
python -m cc_remote.relay        # terminal 1 (set WEB_STATIC_DIR=web/dist to serve the UI)
python -m cc_remote.wrapper      # terminal 2 (on each machine running Claude/Codex)
pytest                           # zero-token unit tests
npm --prefix web run test:reliability
npm --prefix web run test:viewer
npm --prefix web run lint
npm --prefix web run build
```
`pytest.ini` restricts collection to `tests/test_*.py`; these are zero-token
unit/regression tests (stub transport, no model). Real relay/wrapper/model probes
live under `scripts/live/` and may spend model tokens — run them explicitly,
keep prompts trivial ("hi"), and prefer the unit tests.
