# Kouhai Bot — Development Guide

Instructions for AI coding assistants working on this codebase.

## Architecture

```
NapCat (QQ) ──WS──> worker.py
                         │
                         ├── process_event(..., spawn_handlers=True)
                         ├── cmd/*.py  auto-discovered by registry
                         └── scheduler/ background loop (60s tick)
```

## Key Design Decisions

- **Command auto-discovery**: Each command in `handlers/cmd/*.py` calls `register()` at module load. The `registry.discover_commands()` scans with `pkgutil.iter_modules`. Adding a new command = create a `.py` file with a `register()` function.
- **Limited aliases**: Only five short aliases are supported: `/newproblem`→`/np`, `/problem`→`/pb`, `/submit`→`/sbm`, `/review`→`/rv`, `/clarify`→`/clrf`. Old aliases such as `/sb`, `/排名`, and Chinese aliases remain unsupported. New commands default to `aliases=[]` unless explicitly approved.
- **Help auto-generation**: `handlers/cmd/help.py` reads `registry.all_commands()` and builds the help text dynamically. Descriptions must match old bridge.py wording.
  `usage` field = args suffix in /help display (e.g. `usage="你的做法"` → `/submit 你的做法`).
- **Scheduler current-group config**: `~/.kouhai-bot/scheduler_config.json` stores job list + time overrides for `CURRENT_GROUP`. Jobs are defined in `scheduler/jobs.py`.
- **Command event log**: `eventlog.py` writes append-only JSONL command events by real local date. `achievements.py` reads those events for the 04:00-to-04:00 daily report. `eventlog_backfill.py` and `tools/backfill_command_events.py` can reconstruct recent saved submit/clarify/review events from `scoreboard.json`.
- **Formula VL**: `problems/fetcher.py` handles CF formula images → Qwen-VL → inline LaTeX. Has white-bg preprocessing, hallucination detection, retry.
- **Stale cache detection**: `picker.py:fetch_statement()` detects caches created before VL pipeline via `_vl_processed` flag. Stale caches with images are re-fetched with Qwen-VL. Problems with non-formula images (tex-graphics / diagrams) are skipped.
- **No hermes cron involvement**: The bot runs its own scheduler loop (`scheduler/engine.py`), not hermes cron jobs.
- **Single worker runtime**: `worker.py` keeps the NapCat reverse-WS connection, dispatches commands, and owns the scheduler in one process. There is no SQLite event queue, ingress supervisor, worker hot-swap, or auto-update loop.
- **User groups**: `user_groups.py` — all users default to `default`; `USER_GROUPS` configures
  non-default groups such as `starred`/`打星`, their members, submit delay, and rejection
  message. `do_daily_post` writes `state.json` `posted_at`; if missing, cooldown falls back
  to matching `daily_msg.json` mtime.
- **Curfew (宵禁)**: `curfew.py` — `/submit` is blocked during a daily quiet window defined
  by `CURFEW_START_HOUR` and `CURFEW_DURATION_HOURS`. Other commands (clarify, review,
  scoreboard, etc.) are unaffected. Curfew wraps past midnight correctly (e.g. start=22,
  duration=6 → 22:00–04:00).
- **LLM fallback**: `llm.py` — providers are tried in list order defined by
  `llm.providers` in `config.yaml`. Each provider is retried internally
  (`llm.max_retries`) before moving to the next. All providers use the
  OpenAI-compatible `/chat/completions` format. Per-task model overrides
  (`judge_model`, `clarify_model`, etc.) are defined per provider. `thinking`
  and `reasoning_effort` are sent unconditionally; unsupported fields are
  silently ignored by upstream APIs.
- **Official CF tutorials**: Scraped editorials live under `{data_dir}/tutorials/{pid}.json`
  (see `tools/scrape_cf_tutorial.py`). Runtime extraction is in `tutorials.py`. On the
  On **new problem** (`do_daily_post` / `/newproblem`), `schedule_prefetch_editorial(pid)`
  starts background translation (using `summary_model`) into `tutorial_translations/` so first AC
  can deliver without waiting. On **first AC**, congrats is sent in `_finalize_submit`, then
  `schedule_post_solve_editorial_followup()` only **delivers** (awaits in-flight prefetch if
  needed). Neither path uses the state scheduler. `/review` uses English editorial in LLM
  context only.

## Configuration

### config.yaml

Runtime config comes from `config.yaml` at the repo root (or set `KOUHAI_CONFIG=/path/to/config.yaml`).
The file is **never committed** — `config.yaml` is in `.gitignore`.
Copy `config.example.yaml` to `config.yaml` and fill in your values.

All providers use the OpenAI-compatible `/chat/completions` endpoint.
``base_url`` should include any version prefix (e.g. `https://api.openai.com/v1`,
`https://api.deepseek.com`); `/chat/completions` is appended automatically.

### ⚠️ NAPCAT_WS_HOST — Docker gotcha

NapCat runs in a Docker container and connects to the host via `host.docker.internal`
(Docker bridge IP: 172.17.0.1). If the bot binds to `127.0.0.1`, Docker containers
CANNOT connect — they'll get ECONNREFUSED. Always use `0.0.0.0` when NapCat is in Docker.

### LLM fallback

Providers in `llm.providers` are tried **in list order**. Each provider is retried
up to `llm.max_retries` times internally (exponential backoff). On exhaustion, the
next provider is tried. The first successful response wins.

Common fallback pattern: OpenAI (better quality, less stable) → DeepSeek (stable backup):
```yaml
llm:
  providers:
    - name: openai
      model: "gpt-5.5"
      reasoning_effort: "high"
    - name: deepseek
      model: "deepseek-v4-pro"
```

All providers receive the same request payload. Non-applicable fields (e.g.
`reasoning_effort` on DeepSeek, `thinking` on OpenAI) are silently ignored by the
upstream API. `thinking={"type": "enabled"}` is always sent when the judge handler
requests it — it's an OpenAI-compatible extension that DeepSeek supports.

### Transient failures

Transient LLM failures (timeouts, `aiohttp` client errors, `408/409/429/5xx`,
malformed empty-choice responses) are retried inside `llm.py` with exponential
backoff at the per-provider level. Non-retryable errors (4xx besides 408/409/429)
cause immediate fallback to the next provider.

If all providers are exhausted, the user-facing reply should suggest contacting
an administrator rather than claiming the model is "thinking too long".

### Model tags

Each provider can have a `model_tag` — a short emoji/string (e.g. `🐳`, `֎AI`). When
non-empty, it is appended directly (no newline) to every LLM-generated user message:
`/submit` results (correct and incorrect), `/clarify`, `/review`, daily-problem
summaries, and official editorial translations. The LLM has no knowledge of the tag —
tagging is done entirely by the framework after the response is received.

The tag reflects which provider actually served the request. If the primary provider
succeeded, its tag is used. If a fallback provider was invoked, its tag appears instead.
An empty `model_tag` disables the feature per-provider.

## Data Directory

`~/.kouhai-bot/` — mirrors the old `~/.daily-problem/` structure:
```
groups/<gid>/state.json      # today's problem (+ posted_at unix ts when card was delivered)
groups/<gid>/scoreboard.json # cumulative {solves, user_submissions}
groups/<gid>/daily_msg.json  # forward card payload (msg_id/sample_msg_ids/note_msg_id/snake_msg_id 等, for /problem)
groups/<gid>/problem_summaries.json # saved Chinese problem summaries keyed by pid
groups/<gid>/used.json       # used problem IDs
groups/<gid>/groupctx_*.json # group message context
groups/<gid>/command_events/YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl # structured command event log by real local date
groups/<gid>/problem_ratings.json # cached problem rating by pid for weighted scoreboard totals
annotations/pending/<gid>/<pid>.json # pending human-label bundle for solved problems
annotations/labeled/<gid>/<pid>.json # completed human-label bundle for solved problems
statements/<pid>.json        # cached problem statements
tutorials/<pid>.json         # scraped CF editorials (hint/solution/raw_text/code_blocks)
tutorial_translations/<pid>.txt  # cached Chinese editorial for group cards (per pid)
sessions/                    # per-user session context
scheduler_config.json        # job config for CURRENT_GROUP
```

Current-worktree runtime state is stored under the repository checkout, not under the
shared data directory:

```text
No repository-local runtime queue is used.
```

## Command Handlers

| Command | File | Handler | Lock | Model | Notes |
|---------|------|---------|------|-------|-------|
| `/submit` (`/sbm`) | submit.py | `handle` | ✅ state scheduler | per-provider `judge_model` | Judge solution, save history, serialize only first-blood/scoreboard; configured user-group delay checked before enqueue |
| `/clarify` (`/clrf`) | clarify.py | `handle` | ✅ state scheduler | per-provider `clarify_model` | Clarify problem details (JSON output, anti-spoiler, no original problem identity), using admission-time pid |
| `/clear` | clear.py | `handle` | ✅ state scheduler | — | Clear the current user's stored submit/clarify/review history for the admission-time current problem |
| `/newproblem` (`/np`) | newproblem.py | `handle` | ✅ post lock | per-provider `summary_model` | Force new problem when solved (or none); unsolved needs exact `/newproblem --force`; samples are forwarded as separate nodes; if statement has `notes`, translate+symbol-normalize and append as a dedicated notes node; commits state only after card delivery succeeds |
| `/problem` (`/pb`) | stubs.py | `handle_problem` | ❌ | — | Resend via forward card (falls back to text); if solved, add a friendly `/newproblem` hint |
| `/tag` | stubs.py | `handle_tag` | ❌ | — | Show CF tags |
| `/scoreboard` | stubs.py | `handle_scoreboard` | ❌ | — | Cumulative weighted leaderboard; shows the formula at the top, then refreshes latest group nicknames at display time |
| `/help` | help.py | `handle` | ❌ | — | Auto-generated help (forward card) |
| `/review` (`/rv`) | review.py | `handle` | ✅ state scheduler | per-provider `review_model` | Discuss the latest solved problem by default; quoted problem cards can target older problems |
| `/status` | stubs.py | `handle_status` | ❌ | — | Check whether this group has active stateful work |

### Stateful Command Runtime

Stateful commands (`/submit`, `/clarify`, `/review`, `/clear`) no longer serialize
through one global lock or one per-group FIFO execution queue. They run through a
**per-group state scheduler** implemented in `submit.py`; `/newproblem` and
`daily_post` use their own per-group post lock and commit current-problem state only
after delivery.

Key rules:

- **Admission-time snapshots**: every stateful request receives a monotonically
  increasing per-group sequence and snapshots its target pid at admission. `/submit`,
  `/clarify`, and `/clear` use the then-current problem; `/review` uses the then-latest
  solved problem.
- **Parallel compute**: expensive LLM work for `/submit`, `/clarify`, and `/review`
  starts immediately and shares a **global concurrency limit of 8**. Same-user requests
  do not wait for earlier LLM calls to finish.
- **Pending context**: when a request is admitted, its user input is registered in
  in-memory pending context keyed by `(group, user, pid)`. Later same-user requests
  include earlier pending user inputs plus completed `user_submissions`; pending records
  are not persisted and have no fabricated bot reply.
- **Short state critical sections**: JSON read/modify/write endpoints are protected by
  the per-group scheduler async lock. LLM calls never hold this lock.
- **Submit first-blood serialization only**: incorrect/off-topic/failure replies are
  sent as soon as they finish. Correct submits are saved immediately; if earlier
  admission-order submit candidates are still unresolved, the user first gets a short
  “做法判对了～” reply. Only the earliest correct candidate after all earlier candidates
  settle updates `scoreboard.json`, sends rank/top5/reveal, and schedules the official
  tutorial. Later correct candidates log `post_solve_correct` and are saved but do not
  send an extra not-counted message.
- **New problem visibility**: `/newproblem` / `daily_post` pick and summarize a candidate
  without changing `state.json`. Until the new card is successfully delivered, all
  commands still see the old problem. Failed delivery leaves the old current problem
  intact.

`submit.py` exports status helpers used by `/status`:

- `get_group_lock_status(group_id)` — earliest active stateful request for that group, if any

### `/clear` — Clear current-problem user context

- Targets the caller's stored `user_submissions` records for the **current problem only**
- Removes that user's saved `/submit`, `/clarify`, and `/review` history for today's pid
- Runs through the state scheduler and records a clear watermark so earlier in-flight
  pending context for that user/problem is discarded instead of being written after clear
- On success it reacts to the triggering message with the typed `👌` emoji payload
  (`type=2`, `id=128076`) and sends no extra text

### Dispatch Pattern

`handlers.process_event()` is the reusable command-dispatch core. The worker calls it with
`spawn_handlers=True`, so the NapCat WS receive loop does not wait for long-running command
handlers. Tests may pass `spawn_handlers=False` to await a handler directly.

Read-only commands (`/problem`, `/tag`, `/scoreboard`, `/help`, `/status`) still do
not enter the state scheduler.

### Command Event Log

`eventlog.py` owns the append-only structured command log under
`groups/<gid>/command_events/YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl`.

- Dispatch writes a `received` event after a command is recognized.
- Dispatch writes generic `finished` events (`ok` / `error`) for commands that do not
  publish detailed status themselves.
- `/submit`, `/clarify`, and `/review` carry the same event metadata through the group
  state scheduler and write detailed final statuses such as `correct`, `incorrect`,
  `post_solve_correct`, `timeout`, `offtopic`, `stale`, `no_problem`, and
  `no_review_problem`. `post_solve_correct` means a concurrent `/submit` was judged
  correct after an earlier admitted submit had already solved the same problem; it is
  saved to user history but not counted as a new solve and does not send an extra
  user-visible message.
- Event files are partitioned by the event's real Asia/Shanghai date. Do not store
  04:00 logical-day values in the log; achievement/reporting code should read the
  relevant real-date files and filter by `timestamp`.

`tools/backfill_command_events.py` can backfill recent event logs from existing
`scoreboard.json` `user_submissions`:

```bash
uv run python tools/backfill_command_events.py --days 2
```

Backfilled events use `source="backfill_scoreboard"` and a stable `source_key`, so
the tool is safe to run repeatedly. It only reconstructs saved submit/clarify/review
records; it cannot recover off-topic/no-problem/timeout requests that were never
written to `user_submissions`.

### Daily Achievements

`achievements.py` computes the daily achievement report from command events. It uses
the previous 04:00-to-04:00 window, but that logical window is computed at read time
only. The event log still stores real timestamps and real local-date file partitions.

The built-in scheduler job `daily_achievements` runs at 12:00 and reports:

- earliest/latest `/submit`
- most solved problems (`/submit` finished with `status="correct"`)
- most `/submit` attempts
- most `/review`
- most `/clarify`

Existing group scheduler configs that already enable `daily_post` are normalized to
run `daily_achievements` immediately before it. Set
`"disabled_jobs": ["daily_achievements"]` for a group if it should not receive
achievement reports.

### `/submit` — Judge Flow

1. Extract submission text after `/submit`
2. If curfew is active (`curfew_start_hour` → `curfew_start_hour + curfew_duration_hours`),
   reply with a friendly rest message; do not enqueue
3. If user is in a configured non-default group and still inside that group's
   `SUBMIT_DELAY_SEC` after the current problem was posted, reply with that group's
   delay message plus remaining wait time; do not enqueue
4. Enter the group's state scheduler, get a sequence number, and snapshot today's pid
   and solved state
5. Background compute starts immediately; it loads completed user history plus earlier
   pending user inputs for the same `(group, user, pid)`
6. If `SUBMIT_AC_BACKDOOR` is non-empty and the submission contains that string, return a correct verdict before calling the judge LLM
7. Otherwise load user history, react with 👀/[睁眼] ack, and call `judge_submission()`
   `[睁眼]` is a QQ special emoji reaction (emoji id), not plain message text.
8. Incorrect/off-topic/failure results finalize immediately when compute finishes
9. If the problem was already solved when this `/submit` entered the queue: reply
   "已经有人解出..." without calling the judge.
10. If the problem was unsolved at enqueue time, finalize with the judge result even
   if an earlier admitted submit solves it by now.
11. Save submission record (troll if reaction=123, else correct/incorrect).
12. If correct and earlier submit candidates are still unresolved: first reply
    `做法判对了～`, then wait only for first-blood scoreboard resolution.
13. If correct and no earlier admitted submit solved first: update scoreboard, show rank
    + top5 using weighted score (`2^((rating-2000)/300)`), live nickname lookup, and
    the actual per-problem point gain in the success message (for example `本题 +4 分`);
    equal scores share the same rank, and solve count is display-only → reveal →
    send congrats as normal `send_group_msg`, then
    `schedule_post_solve_editorial_followup()` (does **not** await translation).
14. If correct but an earlier admitted submit solved first: save the record, log
    `post_solve_correct`, and do not update the scoreboard. Do not send an additional
    not-counted message and **do not** send the official tutorial again.
15. If incorrect: reply with judge's reason.

### `/clarify` — Anti-Spoiler Clarification

LLM `timeout=600` (10 minutes per HTTP attempt; retries in `shared.py` can extend total wait).
Uses `response_format: json_object`. `thinking: enabled` and `reasoning_effort`
are sent unconditionally; unsupported fields are ignored by the upstream API.
Timeout comes from `llm.clarify_timeout_sec`. Output:
`{"reply": "...", "reaction": ""}`.
- `reaction="123"` for spam/off-topic → react only, no text
- Normal: reply text only, must not leak solution hints
- Must not reveal the original problem identity, including problem ID, title, or contest ID

Loads **Chinese summary from group context** (last assistant message) for LLM grounding.
The target pid is snapshotted at admission. Final saving is protected by the state
scheduler lock, but final reply is not ordered behind unrelated same-group requests.

### `/review` — Latest Solved Problem Discussion

- Targets the group's **most recently solved problem at enqueue time**, not necessarily today's current problem
- Only available after the group has solved at least one problem
- Loads the current user's history for that solved problem as review context
- If the review message @mentions other users, appends those users' same-problem
  context as separate blocks, including saved history plus earlier pending/in-flight
  inputs. Ignore @all, the bot itself, the requester, and duplicate mentions. Do not
  persist anything to mentioned users' histories; only the requester receives the
  saved review record.
- Uses per-provider `review_model` (free text, no JSON format). Timeout from
  `llm.review_timeout_sec`. `thinking: enabled` and `reasoning_effort` are sent
  unconditionally; unsupported fields are silently ignored.
- Long replies (>400 chars) → merged-forward card; short replies → @mention inline
- Saves review interaction to user history under that solved problem's `problem` ID
- If the group has never solved a problem yet, it is rejected before running the expensive review LLM call
- The solved-problem target is snapshotted when the request is admitted so `/review` compute can run in parallel with later same-group requests without being retargeted by a newer AC
- Same-user `/review` and `/submit` requests do **not** serialize on earlier LLM calls; later requests see earlier pending user inputs, and completed bot replies appear only after those requests finish
- If `tutorials/{pid}.json` exists and passes extraction, `_compute_review` appends the **English**
  editorial via `format_editorial_for_review()` (truncated to 12k chars). `REVIEW_PROMPT` states
  that this is official editorial **only the model sees** — do not paste it to the user or spoil
  that the group received a tutorial card. Use it to validate the user's approach and explain WAs.

### 8.5. Review parallelism depends on enqueue-time pid snapshot
If `/review` is meant to compute in parallel with later same-group requests, do not
re-read `get_latest_solved_problem_id()` during review compute. Snapshot the target
pid when admitting the request and carry that pid through compute + finalize, or a
newer AC can silently retarget an older review request.

### `/newproblem` & Daily Post

`/newproblem` vs `/newproblem --force` when today's problem is unsolved:

- Plain `/newproblem` is rejected with a reminder to use `/newproblem --force` (exact string, space required).
- `/newproblem --force` runs the same locked force-post path as solved `/newproblem`
  (shared cooldown + per-group post lock).
- Plain `/problem` (or `/pb`) still resends the current problem card.

`/newproblem` and scheduler `daily_post` share the same locked post implementation.
The command path takes the per-group post lock before checking/updating cooldown, so
concurrent force requests cannot pass cooldown admission and then post one after
another. The scheduler path enters via `do_daily_post(group_id, prefix)`, which wraps
the same locked implementation:
1. Reveal yesterday's problem via `picker.py reveal`
2. Pick a candidate problem via `picker.py pick-json --with-statement`; this marks used
   problems and caches statements but does **not** write `state.json`
3. Generate Chinese summary via `summarize_problem()` → per-provider `summary_model`,
   timeout from `llm.summary_timeout_sec`
4. Self-send summary text; self-send each sample as an independent node; if statement has
   `notes`, translate it to Chinese and append a dedicated `样例解释` node (with LaTeX/Markdown
   artifacts normalized to readable symbols such as `→`, `≤`, `<`, `>`); then append snake
   image and forward all nodes as one merged card to group
5. If delivery succeeds, commit `state.json` with `posted_at` and save `daily_msg.json`
   for `/problem` to resend. If delivery fails, keep the old current problem.
6. Save the Chinese summary to `problem_summaries.json` keyed by pid for later reuse
7. `schedule_prefetch_editorial(pid)` — background editorial translation (not sent yet)

`/newproblem` and scheduler `daily_post` share a per-group post lock so two new posts
do not overlap. They no longer block `/submit`, `/clarify`, or `/review`; those commands
continue using their admission-time problem snapshot while the new card is being built.

### Official tutorials (scrape + runtime)

**Scraping** (offline, not in the bot hot path):

```bash
# Batch: statements/*.json → tutorials/<pid>.json (quality check + 1 retry)
uv run python tools/tutorial_tools.py crawl \
  --statements-dir statements \
  --tutorials-dir ~/.kouhai-bot/tutorials

# Single problem debug
uv run python tools/scrape_cf_tutorial.py \
  --problem-url "https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/542/D" \
  --output /tmp/542D.json

# Optional audit of existing tutorials/
uv run python tools/tutorial_tools.py validate --heuristic-only
```

**Runtime** (`src/kouhai_bot/tutorials.py`):

| Function | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `get_official_editorial(pid)` | Load JSON, extract body (priority: non-placeholder `solution` → `hint` → cleaned `raw_text`; append `code_blocks` for review source only) |
| `prefetch_editorial_zh(pid)` | Background translate on new problem; `{pid}.no_editorial` if none |
| `get_editorial_zh_for_group(editorial, pid)` | Disk cache or `translate_editorial_to_zh()` |
| `has_cached_editorial_zh(pid)` / `is_no_official_editorial(pid)` | Fast paths for delivery |
| `format_editorial_for_review(editorial)` | English block for `/review` LLM user message |

**Group card translation** (`handlers/shared.py:translate_editorial_to_zh`):

- `task="summary"`, `timeout=600`
- Prompt: translate思路/复杂度 only; **omit all program code**; **avoid LaTeX** — prefer Chinese /
  simple symbols (`≤`, `O(n^2)`); keep LaTeX only when unavoidable for clarity
- Post-process: `normalize_editorial_zh_for_qq()` strips `\( \)`, `$$`, common `\le` etc.
- QQ plain text, no Markdown fences in output
- Re-translate after prompt changes: delete `tutorial_translations/{pid}.txt`

**Prefetch** (on new problem + active-worker startup):

- `do_daily_post` calls `schedule_prefetch_editorial(pid)` **immediately after pick** (in parallel
  with `summarize_problem`, not after it — otherwise first AC waits for summary+translation)
- `worker.py` bootstraps `schedule_prefetch_for_current_group()` on startup (covers worker restart without new post)
- Background `prefetch_editorial_zh(pid)` → `tutorial_translations/{pid}.txt` or `{pid}.no_editorial`
- Runs outside the state scheduler (parallel with submit/review/clarify)

**Delivery** (on first AC, `editorial_followup.py`):

- `schedule_post_solve_editorial_followup()` → if cache warm, deliver immediately (no prefetch wait)
- Otherwise await in-flight prefetch, then deliver; cache miss logs and translates (~30s)
- Has cached zh: self-send chunk(s) → `send_group_forward_msg` (low latency)
- No editorial: silent skip (no group message)
- **Not** part of `GroupCoordinator`; do not `await` inside `_finalize_submit`

## Annotation Tooling

Solved problems are exported for human labeling:

- The first accepted `/submit` for a problem triggers `export_problem_annotation_bundle()`
  from `src/kouhai_bot/annotations/exporter.py`
- Exported bundles live under `~/.kouhai-bot/annotations/pending/`
- Bundles include the statement snapshot, per-round `/submit` verdict data, the exact
  `history_before` seen by the judge, and mutable `human_label` fields
- If a saved Chinese summary exists in `problem_summaries.json`, annotation export
  reuses it directly instead of re-translating

Local HTML labeling UI:

- Server entry: `tools/annotation_server.py`
- Static assets: `tools/annotation_web/`
- Start with:
  `uv run python tools/annotation_server.py --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8788`
- For LAN access, bind to `0.0.0.0`
- On startup, the server backfills missing solved-problem bundles
- Detail requests must return quickly; if a bundle lacks `summary_zh`, the UI opens the
  problem immediately and fetches translation asynchronously through
  `POST /api/annotations/{group_id}/{problem_id}/translate`

## Scheduler

- **Engine**: `scheduler/engine.py` — loop at 60s intervals, runs due jobs per group
  configured by `CURRENT_GROUP`; accepts `stop_event` so the single worker can stop cleanly
- **Jobs** (defined in `scheduler/jobs.py`):
  - `daily_achievements` — 12:00: posts yesterday's 04:00-to-04:00 achievement report.
  - `daily_post` — 12:00: checks `should_post_today`. Solved → new problem. Unsolved → reminder.
  - `contest_check` — 12:01: checks CF API for 24h upcoming contests, @all notification with 2s delay.
- Daily post uses the same `do_daily_post` path as `/newproblem`; the post path has a
  per-group lock and commits `state.json` only after successful delivery.

## Adding a New Command

1. Create `src/kouhai_bot/handlers/cmd/yourcommand.py`
2. Define an `async def handle(group_id, user_id, sender, message_id, raw_text, segments, event)`
3. Define `def register()` that calls `registry.register(CommandDef(...))`
4. Set `aliases=[]` unless a new alias is explicitly approved
5. If the command mutates group state or appends to submission history, route it through
   the state scheduler helpers in `submit.py`; read/modify/write JSON sections must
   use the same per-group scheduler lock
6. That's it — auto-discovered, auto-listed in /help

## Adding a Scheduled Job

1. Add an async function in `scheduler/jobs.py`
2. Call `register_job(JobDef(name=..., fn=..., schedule="HH:MM"))`
3. Enable it for `CURRENT_GROUP` in `scheduler_config.json`

## Data Format (critical for compatibility)

### scoreboard.json `solves` entries
```json
{
  "user_id": 123456,       // int (not string!)
  "nickname": "Alice",
  "date": "2026-05-13",    // ISO date string
  "problem": "542D",
  "order": 5               // global solve order
}
```

### submission record format
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2026-05-13T12:00:00+08:00",  // ISO datetime string
  "content": "solution text",
  "result": "correct",      // "correct", "incorrect", "clarify", or "review"
  "reason": "reason text",
  "reply": "reply text",
  "problem": "542D"
}
```

These formats MUST match the old bridge's format exactly for backward compatibility
with existing `~/.daily-problem` data.

## Pitfalls & Lessons Learned

### 1. Stateful scheduler state must be truly shared
All submit/clarify/review/clear entry points in a group must use the SAME scheduler
state for that group. Do not add an ad hoc lock or side path for one command, or
pending context, clear watermarks, and first-blood resolution will diverge.

### 2. Judge user_msg format is JSON
`judge_submission()` sends `json.dumps({"problem": ..., "submission": ..., "history": ...})`.
The judge prompt was written expecting JSON input. Do NOT change to plain text.

### 3. load_problem_statement joins with \n not \n\n
The problem statement sent to the judge must use single `\n` join between sections.
Using `\n\n` adds extra blank lines that affect judging accuracy.

### 4. @mentions need proper OneBot segments
`build_at(user_id)` + `build_text(" text")` creates a real QQ @mention (with notification).
Using `f"@{nickname}"` in plain text is a fake @mention — no notification.

### 5. Contest notifications need @all
`{"type": "at", "data": {"qq": "all"}}` — the contest check must notify everyone.
Using plain text without @all means nobody sees the notification.

### 6. WS host must be 0.0.0.0 for Docker
See Configuration section above. Binding to `127.0.0.1` breaks Docker NapCat connectivity.

### 7. react_emoji needs int message_id
NapCat's `set_msg_emoji_like` API expects `message_id` as int. Pass string and it
silently fails.

### 8. save_scoreboard needs indent=2
Must pass `json.dump(sb, f, ensure_ascii=False, indent=2)` for backward compatibility
with old scoreboard files.

### 9. save_user_submission trims to 20
Per-user submission history is capped at 20 entries to prevent unbounded growth.

### 10. Save Chinese summaries by pid if you need later reuse
The summary shown in the group post is now persisted in `groups/<gid>/problem_summaries.json`.
Annotation export and the HTML labeling UI reuse this first before attempting any new
translation. Do not force synchronous translation on detail-page clicks.

### 11. Daily post uses merged-forward
`do_daily_post()` self-sends summary text, sample nodes, optional translated notes node,
and snake image, then forwards them as one merged card. `daily_msg.json` must persist
all node references (`msg_id`, `sample_msg_ids`, optional `note_msg_id`, `snake_msg_id`)
so `/problem` can resend the same card.
Complicated but essential for good UX.

### 12. Dispatch uses create_task
Commands are `asyncio.create_task`'d, not `await`ed. This prevents lightweight
commands from queuing behind locked operations.

### 13. Off-topic submissions are NOT saved
If the judge returns `reaction: "123"`, the submission is marked as troll and
NOT recorded to scoreboard. The save happens AFTER the reaction check.

### 14. Do not add local off-topic blacklists for `/submit` or `/clarify`
Off-topic handling belongs to the model output (`reaction="123"`), not substring
matching in the command entrypoint. Local blacklists are too brittle and can
misfire on normal solution text such as `操作`.

### 15. Nickname fallback is user_id not "群友"
`get_display_name()` / `_nick()` fall back to `str(user_id)` (as a string of digits),
never a generic placeholder like "群友".

### 16. Every message text matters
The old bridge has specific wording for each message. Every difference was caught
in review — validation messages, error messages, reminder text, greeting text.
All must match exactly. See the commit history for the iterative alignment process.

### 17. LaTeX in problem summaries
`summarize_problem()` prompt explicitly forbids LaTeX/markdown. The summary model
sometimes still outputs LaTeX — ping the user if you see this happening.

### 18. Annotation detail pages must not block on translation
The annotation UI can show a placeholder for `summary_zh`, then fetch translation
asynchronously. Clicking a problem in the left pane should open the right pane
immediately; do not make `handle_detail()` await a long translation call.

### 19. Active status tracking prevents confusing UX
The scheduler exposes earliest active request metadata so `/status` can tell users
there is in-flight stateful work. It is not a queue head and does not imply unrelated
commands are blocked.

### 20. Clarify reasoning controls
`/clarify` sends `thinking={"type": "enabled"}` and `reasoning_effort` unconditionally.
The upstream API silently ignores fields it doesn't support. The JSON output format
may occasionally break if extra reasoning content leaks into the response —
`robust_json_parse` handles this.

### 21. `uv run start` / `restart` / `stop` / `status` are selected by NapCat WS port
The `start`, `restart`, `stop`, and `status` entrypoints must use the configured `NAPCAT_WS_PORT` to
identify the target instance. Do not kill by broad process names like
`kouhai_bot.worker`, because production and test instances may run at the same time.
`uv run start` should refuse to launch a second instance if that port already has a
listener. `uv run restart` should stop the existing listener on that port, then
start a fresh detached background instance. `uv run stop` should stop the existing
listener on that port only. `uv run status` should report whether the port is occupied
and whether the listener appears to come from the current worktree.

### 22. Official tutorial: first AC only, two messages
Congrats must stay a direct `send_group_msg` with @mention. Editorial delivery is scheduled
via `editorial_followup` **after** finalize returns (background task). Merged-forward when
editorial exists; nothing sent when not. Never bundle congrats and editorial in one card.
Never `await` editorial translation inside submit finalize — it blocks the whole group queue.

### 23. Tutorial translation cache is per pid
`tutorial_translations/{pid}.txt` is not invalidated when scrape JSON changes. Delete the
cache file to force re-translation after updating prompts or rescraping editorial text.

### 24. Review vs group card use different editorial forms
`/review` gets English source (+ code in extracted text) for internal grounding.
The post-AC card gets Chinese translation without code. Do not send Chinese translation
into review unless product requirements change.

## Testing

```bash
uv sync --group dev
uv run python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

Tests mock `data_dir`, group state files, and LLM responses for end-to-end
command testing. The suite covers submit, clarify, review, problem, tag, scoreboard,
newproblem, annotation export, napcat parsing, registry discovery, and
`tutorials.py` extraction/translation (`tests/test_tutorials.py`; submit/review
editorial paths in `tests/test_commands.py`).

## GitHub CI

- `.github/workflows/require-markdown-docs.yml` runs on PRs targeting `master`
- It fails unless the PR adds or modifies at least one `*.md` file
- To make this merge-blocking in GitHub itself, keep `require-markdown-docs` registered as a required status check in branch protection or the repository ruleset

## Startup

```bash
cd ~/kouhai-bot
uv run start
```

`uv run start` launches a detached background instance. stdout/stderr are appended to:

```text
~/.kouhai-bot/logs/<CURRENT_GROUP>/YYYY-MM-DD.log
```

If the configured `NAPCAT_WS_PORT` is already in use, `uv run start` should print a
short status report and leave the existing instance alone.

The detached instance is launched with `nohup`, and its working directory should be the
current repo root so `uv run status` can later tell whether the listener belongs to the
current worktree.

For a foreground debugging session, you can still run:

```bash
cd ~/kouhai-bot
uv run python -m kouhai_bot.worker
```

The worker starts the WS server, discovers commands, registers scheduler jobs,
prefetches the current group's tutorial if needed, and runs the scheduler. No
external cron or process manager needed.

For an already-managed local instance, prefer:

```bash
cd ~/kouhai-bot
uv run restart
```

`uv run restart` selects the target instance by the configured `NAPCAT_WS_PORT`, so
it is the safer choice when production and test bots coexist on the same machine.
It stops the old listener on that port, launches a detached replacement, and prints
a short status summary (`stopped_existing`, `started`, `pid`, `log`, etc.).

`uv run stop` should print whether it found and stopped a listener on that port.

`uv run status` should print a short machine-readable summary like:

```text
action=status
port=<selected-ws-port>
occupied=yes|no
current_worktree_running=yes|no|unknown
pids=...
```

Interpretation:
- `occupied=yes` means the configured WS port is currently listening.
- `current_worktree_running=yes` means at least one listener on that port has `cwd`
  equal to this repo worktree root.
- `current_worktree_running=no` means the port is occupied, but the listener appears
  to belong to another worktree or process.
- `current_worktree_running=unknown` means the port is occupied, but process cwd
  inspection was not reliable enough to decide.

## Deployment & Groups

The served group is configured via `config.yaml`:
- `current_group` — the single QQ group where commands work and scheduled posts are sent

Start with a test group first; switch `current_group` to the production group after verification.

Production and test bot instances must use separate NapCat reverse WebSocket ports.
When starting or restarting a bot, use the production port for the production bot and
the test port for the test bot. If an instruction says only "start" or "restart" and
the intended instance/port is unclear, ask the developer which bot profile and port to
use before taking action. Do not use broad process-name restarts when multiple bot
instances are running; stop or start only the selected instance.

**Start / Restart / Stop / Status procedure:**
```bash
cd ~/kouhai-bot
uv run start
```

```bash
cd ~/kouhai-bot
uv run restart
```

```bash
cd ~/kouhai-bot
uv run stop
```

```bash
cd ~/kouhai-bot
uv run status
```

**Verify connection:**
```bash
ss -tnp | grep <selected-ws-port>              # should show ESTAB from the NapCat container
sudo docker logs napcat --tail 5 | grep <selected-ws-port>  # should NOT show errors for the selected port
```

## Data Migration

Old data lives at `~/.daily-problem/`. New data at `~/.kouhai-bot/`.
The old directory is preserved as backup — never delete it.

To migrate a group's data:
```bash
cp -r ~/.daily-problem/groups/<gid> ~/.kouhai-bot/groups/<gid>
```

The picker subprocess is the in-repository `src/kouhai_bot/problems/picker.py`.
It uses `~/.kouhai-bot` as its default data directory, with group-specific state
selected by the `--group` flag.

## Design Decisions

- **No catch_up_daily_post**: The old bridge had a startup catch-up that posted if
  started after 12:00 with no problem. This was intentionally REMOVED — it makes
  workflow unpredictable. Missed is missed; don't auto-recover.
- **Daily post delivery**: Must use merged-forward (self-send text + snake image →
  forward card + daily_msg.json). The plain-text simplification was rejected.
- **Old bridge.py behavior is the ground truth**: All behavior, message text, data
  formats, and edge cases must match the legacy bridge implementation. When in doubt,
  compare against the old code if it is available in your local environment.

## Review Checklist

When making changes, verify against old bridge.py:

1. **Data format**: scoreboard entry fields (user_id int, date, order), submission
   record fields (timestamp ISO, result string, clarify/review result types), save_scoreboard indent=2
2. **@mentions**: Use `build_at` + `build_text` segments for real QQ mentions
3. **Message text**: Every validation/error/success message verbatim from old bridge
4. **Scheduler lock sharing**: submit/clarify/review/clear use the same per-group
   scheduler; JSON read/modify/write sections use the per-group scheduler lock
5. **Judge format**: user_msg is JSON `{"problem","submission","history"}`
6. **Contest**: @all notification, 2s delay
7. **Dispatch**: create_task (not await), skip own messages, extract_text with @mentions
8. **WS**: bind 0.0.0.0 for Docker, max_size=2**26, ping_interval=30, ping_timeout=10
9. **Trimming**: save_user_submission trims to 20, save_scoreboard indent=2
10. **Nickname fallback**: `card or nick or str(user_id)` — never "群友"
11. **Status visibility**: new stateful commands MUST publish active request metadata
    so `/status` still reports in-flight work correctly
12. **Official tutorial**: first AC only; congrats + separate forward card; translation
    omits code; review uses English editorial in LLM context only, not user-visible spoiler
