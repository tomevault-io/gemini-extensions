# Windsurf Rules - Testing

> Apply when working with test files.

## Structure

- Use AAA pattern: Arrange → Act → Assert
- One assertion concept per test
- Descriptive names: "should [action] when [condition]"

## Philosophy

- Test behavior, not implementation
- Mock external dependencies (APIs, DB)
- Prefer integration tests for critical paths

## Coverage

- >80% on business logic
- 100% on security-critical code
- Skip trivial getters/setters
