Machine-readable metadata (parse first for GitHub MCP operations):

```yaml
# repo-metadata
owner: techspokes
repo: typescript-wsdl-client
package: '@techspokes/typescript-wsdl-client'
# version: always read from package.json
defaultBranch: main
issues: 'https://github.com/techspokes/typescript-wsdl-client/issues'
discussions: 'https://github.com/techspokes/typescript-wsdl-client/discussions'
ciWorkflow: 'ci.yml'
cliBinary: wsdl-tsc
node: '>=20'
```

### GitHub MCP Usage Guidelines (minimal)

1. Use `owner` / `repo` from YAML; read `package.json` each time you need the version (no caching).
2. Commit/PR titles: prefix with `Version: <version>` (see commit format rules).
3. Default PR base: `main` unless explicitly overridden.
4. Prefer repo-scoped queries; avoid broad GitHub-wide searches for issues/PRs.
5. For releases, read `CHANGELOG.md` and `package.json` and follow the release workflow below.
6. Don't remote-fetch metadata already present in this file or `package.json`.
7. For any code or docs change, propose (and on confirmation add) a concise bullet under `## [Unreleased]` in `CHANGELOG.md` (omit the `Version: <'>` prefix).

## Project Context

Purpose: generate fully-typed TypeScript SOAP clients from WSDL/XSD, with optional OpenAPI 3.1 and Fastify REST gateway.

Key features: deterministic JSON/SOAP metadata with attribute and element flattening; `$value` convention for text content; inheritance resolution for complex and simple content; choice handling strategies; WS-Policy hints; string-first primitive mapping by default; catalog introspection via `catalog.json` reused across all generation stages.

Primary users: TypeScript developers integrating with SOAP services.

Maintainer: Serge Liatko ([@sergeliatko](https://github.com/sergeliatko)). Vendor: TechSpokes (https://www.techspokes.com).

### Runtime and tooling

- Node.js `>= 20.0.0` (see `engines.node` in `package.json`).
- TypeScript strict, ES2022, `type: "module"` (ESM/NodeNext style).
- CLI binary: `wsdl-tsc` (entry: `dist/cli.js`), orchestrating the pipeline.
- The `soap` package is a runtime dependency for consumers. The `wsdl-tsc` CLI itself is a devDependency in consumer projects.

### Generated artifacts

- Client: `client.ts`, `types.ts`, `utils.ts`, `operations.ts`, co-located `catalog.json`.
- OpenAPI: 3.1 spec (`.json`/`.yaml`) mirroring the TS model.
- Gateway: Fastify route handlers with SOAP client calls, envelope wrapping, error handling, and runtime array unwrap (`plugin.ts`, `routes.ts`, `routes/`, `schemas.ts`, `schemas/`, `runtime.ts`, `_typecheck.ts`).

### Catalog co-location

Important for reasoning about paths:
- `compile`: explicit `--catalog-file` (no default).
- `client`: defaults to `{client-dir}/catalog.json`.
- `openapi`: defaults to `{dir-of-openapi-file}/catalog.json`.
- `pipeline`: cascade lookup: `{client-dir}` / `{openapi-dir}` / `{gateway-dir}` / `tmp/`.

Scratchpads: non-project notes may live under ad-hoc folders; treat them as scratchpads only, not as source of truth for behavior or docs.

### Project evolution

The project evolved from a simple WSDL parser (v0.1.x) to a full generation pipeline (v0.9.x through v0.10.x). The gateway generator reads OpenAPI specs, not the catalog directly, to produce Fastify route handlers. Since v0.10.0 the gateway has end-to-end type safety from WSDL definitions through to HTTP response types. Since v0.11.0 the project includes a full Vitest test suite, a typed operations interface for mocking, and runtime ArrayOf* unwrap.

## Project Structure

Source is in `src/` with these modules: `loader/` (WSDL fetching and parsing), `compiler/` (XSD to catalog compilation), `client/` (TypeScript client and operations interface generation), `openapi/` (OpenAPI 3.1 spec generation), `gateway/` (Fastify route handler and runtime generation), `app/` (standalone application scaffold), `util/` (shared helpers, CLI builder, errors), `xsd/` (XSD type definitions), and `types/` (shared TypeScript type definitions).

The pipeline orchestrator is `src/pipeline.ts`. Configuration defaults are in `src/config.ts`.

## CLI and Commands (align with README)

CLI entry: `wsdl-tsc` (via `npx wsdl-tsc` in README examples).

Commands (6 total; keep terminology consistent with README):
- `compile`: WSDL / `catalog.json` only (no TS code).
- `client`: WSDL or catalog / TS client (`client.ts`, `types.ts`, `utils.ts`, `operations.ts`, `catalog.json`).
- `openapi`: WSDL or catalog / OpenAPI 3.1 spec.
- `gateway`: OpenAPI / Fastify REST gateway (route handlers, schemas, runtime, type-check fixture).
- `app`: standalone Fastify application scaffold wiring the gateway plugin.
- `pipeline`: one-shot compile / client / OpenAPI / gateway (full stack).

When changing CLI behavior, keep flag names consistent with README (lowercase, hyphenated, e.g. `--wsdl-source`, `--openapi-file`). Update CLI sections in `README.md` (commands, examples, tables) and any relevant smoke/CI scripts in `package.json`. Ensure catalog co-location behavior remains aligned with README, or update docs and scripts together.

## Testing

The project uses Vitest for three layers of testing: unit tests (pure functions), snapshot tests (generated output baselines), and integration tests (gateway routes via Fastify inject with mock clients).

### Test commands

Inspect `"scripts"` in `package.json` for the full list. Key commands:
- `npm test`: all Vitest tests.
- `npm run test:unit`: unit tests only.
- `npm run test:snap`: snapshot tests only.
- `npm run test:integration`: integration tests only.
- `npm run test:watch`: watch mode for development.
- `npm run ci`: build, typecheck, all Vitest tests, and smoke pipeline.

### Mock client pattern

Integration tests use a mock client implementing the `{Service}Operations` interface from the generated `operations.ts`. The mock returns SOAP wrapper-shaped data matching the real client structure. The generated `unwrapArrayWrappers()` function handles conversion to flat arrays for serialization. See `test/integration/gateway-routes.test.ts` for the reference implementation.

### Snapshot updates

When modifying generators, run snapshot tests and update baselines with `npx vitest run test/snapshot -u`. Always review the diff before committing updated snapshots.

### Test fixture

All tests and smoke scripts use `examples/minimal/weather.wsdl` as the canonical test fixture.

## Key Conventions

- String-first primitive mapping: `xs:long` and `xs:decimal` default to `string` to prevent precision loss.
- `$value` convention for XML text content alongside attributes.
- Flattened attributes as peer properties with no nested wrappers.
- `catalog.json` is the intermediate compiled WSDL representation, reused across all generation stages.
- URN format for gateway schemas: `urn:services:{service}:{version}:schemas:{models|operations}:{slug}`.
- All generated output must be deterministic and diff-friendly with sorted types, paths, and schemas.

## Scripts and Local Tooling (package.json as source of truth)

### Node and CLI entry

- Node engine: read from `engines.node` in `package.json` (currently `>=20.0.0`).
- CLI binary mapping: read from `bin.wsdl-tsc` in `package.json` (currently `dist/cli.js`).

### Scripts

Do not hardcode script lists here. Inspect `"scripts"` in `package.json` for `build`, `typecheck`, `ci`, smoke scripts, and others. Infer behavior from script names and values instead of maintaining a separate canonical list.

- `build`: compile TypeScript to `dist/`.
- `typecheck`: run `tsc --noEmit`.
- `clean*`: remove `dist`/`tmp` or other temporary artifacts.
- `dev` / `watch`: run the CLI in dev/watch mode via `tsx`.
- `smoke:*`: end-to-end CLI checks (compile, client, openapi, gateway, pipeline) using `examples/minimal/weather.wsdl`.
- `ci`: combine build, typecheck, Vitest tests, and smoke pipeline.

### Terminal commands

- Use one command per line, no `&&` chaining (PowerShell-friendly).
- Prefer `npm run <script>` and `npx wsdl-tsc` patterns consistent with README and `package.json`.

## How to Propose and Shape Changes

- Prefer small, focused diffs: one feature or bugfix per change.
- Update CLI help output and `README.md` when user-visible CLI behavior changes.
- Keep TypeScript strict and consistent with existing `tsconfig.json`.
- Maintain ESM/NodeNext style and `type: "module"` conventions.
- Avoid new dependencies unless clearly justified; prefer existing tools (`tsc`, `tsx`, `rimraf`).
- Preserve string-first primitive mapping defaults unless a flag explicitly requests another mapping (e.g. `--client-int64-as number`).
- Keep JSON / SOAP mapping and OpenAPI structure deterministic and stable for diff-friendly regeneration.

## Commit Message Format (required)

Always read current version from `package.json` and start commit titles with `Version: <version>`.

Format (Conventional Commits style):

```text
Version: <version> <type>(<optional-scope>): <imperative summary>
```

Rules:
- Treat `"version"` in `package.json` as read-only in normal work; releases handle bumps.
- Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, etc.
- Title <= 72 characters.
- Place rationale, risks, and references (e.g. `Closes #123`) in the body.

Examples:
- `Version: 0.8.0 feat(cli): add --flag to control attribute key`
- `Version: 0.8.0 fix(emitter): stabilize operation order in meta`
- `Version: 0.8.0 docs: clarify NodeNext setup and imports`

## CHANGELOG Rules (align with current file)

- Keep `## [Unreleased]` at the top; new entries go there.
- Style: one-line entries, no file lists, no vague phrasing.
- For each code/docs change, ensure a bullet under `## [Unreleased]` before concluding work.
- In interactive contexts, ask for confirmation to append a bullet derived from the commit title (strip `Version: <'>`).
- In non-interactive contexts (e.g. CI), append the bullet automatically.

### Release workflow

1. Read current version from `package.json`.
2. Determine semver bump (patch/minor/major) based on `Unreleased` changes.
3. Update `"version"` in `package.json` and `package-lock.json` to the new release version.
4. In `CHANGELOG.md`: promote `## [Unreleased]` to `## [<version>] - YYYY-MM-DD` (today's date) and start a fresh, empty `## [Unreleased]` section at the top.
5. Bump hardcoded dependency versions in `src/app/generateApp.ts` (the `generatePackageJson` function) to current latest. The generated app scaffold ships these versions to end users; stale minimums deliver outdated code with potential security issues out of the box. Check latest with `npm view <pkg> version` for: fastify, fastify-plugin, soap, tsx, typescript.
6. Run `npm run ci` to verify the release. This runs build, typecheck, all Vitest tests (unit, snapshot, integration), and the smoke pipeline in one pass. All steps must pass before committing the release.

### Updating the CHANGELOG

- Propose a single bullet for `Unreleased` based on the described change.
- Match the tone and precision of existing entries (e.g. `feat(cli):`, `fix(openapi):`).

## What to Generate (for Copilot Chat)

### Creating a commit message

1. Read the version from `package.json`.
2. Use the `Version: <version> <type>(scope): summary` format.
3. Provide an optional body with context, risks, or references.

### Updating CHANGELOG.md

- Draft a single bullet for `## [Unreleased]` derived from the commit summary (no `Version:` prefix).
- Ask for confirmation before editing the file in interactive contexts.

### Preparing a release

- Bump the version in `package.json` and `package-lock.json`.
- Promote `Unreleased` to a dated section `## [x.y.z] - YYYY-MM-DD`.
- Insert a new empty `## [Unreleased]` at the top.
- Bump hardcoded dep versions in `src/app/generateApp.ts`.
- Run `npm run ci` to verify (build, typecheck, Vitest tests, smoke pipeline).

### Editing code that affects CLI, OpenAPI, or gateway

- Keep TypeScript and NodeNext settings intact.
- Align flags, examples, and terminology with the current README and docs.
- Ensure catalog co-location behavior matches the docs.

## Don'ts

- Don't use `version bump` phrasing in commit messages or changelog entries.
- Don't alter the project version in regular feature/fix commits (only in release steps).
- Don't introduce breaking CLI flags or behavior without updating README CLI docs, examples, and relevant smoke/CI scripts in `package.json`.
- Don't treat scratchpad or non-project docs as authoritative for behavior; use README, CHANGELOG, `package.json`, and `src/` instead.
- Don't edit files in generated output directories (client/, gateway/, app/); regenerate from WSDL sources instead.

## Documentation Conventions

- Prefer pointers to the authoritative source over duplicating indexes across files.
- The root README.md Documentation table is the single source of truth for the docs/ directory listing.
- When adding, removing, or renaming documentation files, update only the root README.md Documentation table; other files should reference it rather than maintaining their own copies.
- Each folder may have its own README.md (folder index) and AGENTS.md (agent instructions) per their respective specifications; these should point upward rather than duplicating content.

### Instruction file hierarchy

This file (`.github/copilot-instructions.md`) is the authoritative source for all agent behavior. The `.github/instructions/` directory contains file-pattern-specific rules that augment this file (e.g., markdown formatting rules for `**/*.md`). `AGENTS.md` is the tool-agnostic buffer pointing here. Vendor-specific files (`CLAUDE.md`, `llms.txt`) point to `AGENTS.md` and add only tool-specific details.
