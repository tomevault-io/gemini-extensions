# Repository Instructions

The active codebase is entirely Python.
Before starting implementation work, update or read the relevant docs first so the intended public behavior, ownership rules, and limitations are explicit; then implement code and tests to match that documented contract.

Update `CHANGELOG.md` under **Unreleased** whenever a change adds or changes
user- or maintainer-visible behavior, public APIs, supported features,
examples, build or CI workflows, benchmark methodology, or documented
limitations. Keep entries concise and outcome-focused; do not add release
notes for internal cleanup that has no visible effect.

Write user documentation as a concise guide to the current product. Lead with
the task a user wants to complete, show the necessary command or example, and
state only the behavior, choices, and limitations needed to use it correctly.
Do not narrate implementation history, prior bugs, rejected designs, internal
mechanics, defensive checks, or why a newly added behavior differs from an old
one unless that context changes what the user must do. Integrate changes into
the existing workflow instead of appending a change report, and remove any
sentence whose only purpose is to justify the implementation or record the
development process.

Treat developer documentation as durable guides, not as per-change
implementation logs. Do not update developer pages merely because code changed,
and do not add incidental low-level details that are unnecessary for following
the documented architecture or maintainer workflow. Update them only when a
documented contract, ownership boundary, workflow, or limitation changes; keep
routine implementation findings in the review summary or a concise CHANGELOG
entry when appropriate.

Ignore:
- *.f90
- *.f95
- *.for
- *.c
- *.h
- *.json

Do not spend context window or analysis on those files unless explicitly requested.
Keep one path for one question. When two entry points answer the same
question -- one file and a project, a library route and its CLI wrapper, source
discovery and compile ordering, a source build and a contract replay -- they
must call the same owner and differ only in the inputs they pass, such as which
files or modules are in scope. Do not write a second loop, list, inventory,
regex, lexer, or conversion route that re-derives what an existing owner
decides, even as a fast path: a fast path may narrow what the owner reads, but
the owner's answer stays the only answer. Before adding a helper that
enumerates or classifies something -- a module's procedures, a file's program
units, a `use` nature, the intrinsic modules, Fortran source suffixes, a
submodule's identity -- find the existing owner and extend it. When two copies
are found, merge them into one owner instead of fixing only the copy that
failed, and prove the merge with a test that runs both entry points on one
input and compares their results.

When asked to change or move an API, import path, command, feature, or behavior, do not add or keep compatibility layers, aliases, shims, fallback paths, or legacy entrypoints unless explicitly requested. A requested change means the old behavior should be removed.
When updating tests, remove obsolete tests that only assert removed/old implementation behavior does not exist. Do not preserve rejection or absence checks for API/features that were intentionally removed unless explicitly requested.
Do not add tests whose purpose is only to prove that removed or nonexistent features are rejected. Test supported behavior and meaningful validation boundaries instead. For example, if `ArrayCategory` is removed, delete its tests; do not add a test asserting that `ArrayCategory` now fails.

Optimize the test suite for maximum confidence per test and minimum
maintenance burden, not for test count. Treat end-to-end tests as the primary
proof that a feature works: where practical, demonstrate a feature through the
real workflow (source, preprocessing, parsing, semantic IR, `.pyi` contract,
replay or build, generated wrapper, compile and link, import, runtime call) and
finish by checking a concrete, repeatable result such as runtime values, native
state, generated contract or source text, or the native build plan. One strong
end-to-end test that covers several cooperating features should replace
several lower-level tests that only repeat pieces of the same behavior.

Delete a test, rather than preserve it because it exists, when its only
purpose is to check implementation details, trivial getters, constructors,
dataclass fields, or plumbing; to repeat behavior a stronger end-to-end test
already proves; to assert an intermediate object only because it currently
exists; to test a tiny helper that is exercised thoroughly elsewhere; to repeat
one case at several stages; to lock internal architecture without protecting
user-visible behavior; or to add near-identical permutations that do not
represent distinct failure modes.

Keep a focused isolated test only when it is the cheapest or clearest way to
protect a boundary that end-to-end tests do not cover economically, and when
it has a clear answer to: **what realistic regression does this catch that
would otherwise be difficult, expensive, or ambiguous to detect?** Typical
answers are parser grammar edge cases; preprocessing and source-discovery
rules; semantic transformations with many meaningful combinations; export and
re-export resolution; diagnostics and error locations; contract round trips;
compiler-independent behavior that would otherwise need many native builds;
subtle regressions whose end-to-end failure would not say which rule broke;
and negative validation paths that are cumbersome or unsafe to reproduce
through a full build. If there is no good answer, remove the test. In PRIK,
scrutinize especially tests of parser internals, semantic IR details,
policy and planning intermediates, generated-code string fragments,
source-versus-build route parity, and duplicated source-versus-generated-`.pyi`
assertions; where the two routes are meant to agree, prefer one shared parity
test over the same behavioral assertions in both.

When fixing a real bug, first ask whether an existing end-to-end test can be
strengthened to cover the regression. If not, add the smallest focused
regression test at the layer where the bug reproduces clearly. Do not add a
unit test merely because production code changed. Before testing a subsystem
in isolation, list the distinct realistic ways it could fail and test those
behavioral boundaries with a small table of meaningful cases instead of
mirroring the implementation line by line. Do not change production behavior
to make a test easier to delete.

Treat tests as evidence for a named invariant, not as specifications merely
because they already exist. Add or retain automated tests when they protect at
least one of the following:

- externally observable behavior or a public API;
- a documented diagnostic or serialized/generated format;
- ABI, ownership, lifetime, memory-safety, build, or release behavior;
- a stage handoff or architectural boundary whose violation would allow a
  downstream stage to make an upstream decision; or
- repository structure that is directly consumed by tooling.

Do not add tests whose only purpose is to freeze prose, wording, heading or
section order, private class or function names, complete file inventories,
dataclass field inventories, exact internal call order, preferred inheritance,
or incidental directory/module layout. Those are recommendations for
contributor review unless the user explicitly promotes one to a maintained
contract. Unit tests may construct internal models when their behavior or
completed state is the invariant, but they should not assert implementation
shape just to prevent refactoring.

When an existing test fails after an intentional change, identify the behavior
or risk it was meant to protect before changing production code. Keep or
rewrite the test when that invariant remains a contract; remove it when it only
records the previous implementation or a recommendation. Do not change correct
behavior solely to satisfy a brittle test.

Before adding a test, name the invariant, its feature or infrastructure owner,
and the earliest stage that can prove it. Keep the resulting evidence concise:

- One test may assert several related consequences of the same setup and
  invariant. Do not create one test function per field or incidental detail.
- Use parametrization when cases exercise the same operation and assertion
  shape with different inputs, and give every row a descriptive ID. Keep only
  the rows that exercise distinct code paths instead of a full matrix.
- Prefer one end-to-end workflow that exercises several cooperating features
  over a separate native build for every small operation.
- Do not repeat the same invariant at adjacent stages. Add another stage test
  only when it protects a real handoff, completed decision, generated artifact,
  ABI mechanism, or runtime behavior.
- Cover combinatorial language cases at the cheapest owning stage. End-to-end
  tests should cover each distinct compilation, ABI, ownership, lifetime, or
  runtime mechanism, not every combination already established below it.
- When source and generated-contract builds must agree, compare the two lanes
  in one test or shared case instead of maintaining unrelated duplicate tests.
- When several tests use the same native project and require no isolated build
  state, build it once through an appropriately scoped pytest fixture. Do not
  share mutable native state unless the fixture resets it deterministically.
- Prefer existing test helpers. Add a shared helper only when it removes
  repeated setup from multiple tests without hiding the behavior being tested.
- Do not duplicate a complete expected artifact in several tests. Keep one
  reviewed golden or fixture as its authority and make focused tests assert
  only the relevant property.
- Do not assert complete generated source text when a focused structural or
  behavioral assertion proves the invariant, unless the generated text is
  itself a documented serialized format.
- When removing or consolidating a test, identify the invariant it protected
  and show where that invariant remains covered.

Organize native test sources by their evidence owner:

- A permanent source compiled by a test belongs in a fixture file.
- A multi-file native project uses one fixture file per real source file.
- A source shared by tests, or a substantial source of roughly 20 lines or
  more, should normally be a fixture file.
- A small syntax example should remain inline when locality makes the test
  clearer.
- Programmatically generated, parametrized, or deliberately mutated source may
  remain inline and must be written only to pytest temporary directories.
- Place fixtures beneath the feature or infrastructure mechanism that owns the
  asserted behavior and beneath the relevant stage. Do not place
  feature-specific sources in `_support` or create a global collection of
  unrelated fixtures.

The agent owns the review work that is not delegated to rigid tests. Before and
after a refactor, compare the affected public behavior and stage outputs. When
editing documentation, examples, diagnostics, or generated text, preserve the
existing meaning, behavior, and wording as much as the request permits; inspect
the diff and run the affected example or focused command when practical. Treat
illustrative wording and demonstration output as review recommendations unless
they are explicitly documented as stable formats. A command/result pair shown
in a package guide must remain factual: run the command and compare stable
output with the page, or validate only the displayed invariant when the output
is an excerpt or depends on the active target. Do not duplicate that expected
output in a separate test inventory.

Before wrapper planning begins in `prik/planning/planner.py`, the
post-IR policy stage must have completed every semantic decision needed by
wrapper generation, including object kind, ownership, transfer, destruction,
mutability/writeback, nullability, output projection, release responsibility,
contract-value storage mode (`stack`, `heap`, or `alias`), getter behavior,
native setter assignment, and Python setter exposure. Bridge and binding
generators may only dispatch from those completed decisions into small named
implementation methods. They must not infer or override semantic policy from
datatype, `intent`, dotted-variable shape, `is_alias`, or local memory checks,
and they must not contain a fallback that silently chooses a different
behavior. When such a decision is found in bridge or binding code, remove it
there and move it into post-IR policy completion. Backend-local helper
temporaries may still be created inside the selected implementation method
because they are emitted-code details, not semantic policy.

For behavior changes, first try to express the change in completed semantic
policy or the shared wrapper plan. Change binding or bridge lowering only when
the selected plan requires a genuinely new emitted-code mechanism; those
generators should otherwise keep reusing and dispatching existing planned
paths.

A decision is read, not recomputed. Completed policy moving forward also means a
later stage must not derive the same answer a second time, which is harder to
notice than an override because the second site often calls the same helper and
so reads as reuse rather than as a second authority. When two places need one
answer, ask: **if these two call sites disagreed, which one would be wrong?** If
that has no answer, the decision has two authorities and no owner; if it has
one, the other site must read the answer rather than compute it. This applies to
derivation carrying state or a condition — a collision counter, a reservation
ledger, a language gate, a default — because that is what drifts; calling a
pure, total helper from several stages is fine. Read the owner's recorded
output: the completed policy, the shared plan, or the metadata the owner wrote.
Where a stage cannot run the owner's full completion, run the narrower
completion step for that one decision rather than deriving it again — contract
extraction must describe C that the direct-only wrapper would reject, so
`emit_module_stubs` completes public-name policy for every module and the rest
only where a build request allows it. Sharing the owner's helper is not enough
when the derivation keeps a ledger: two allocators fed the same declarations in
a different order produce the same set of names attached to different
declarations, which every per-stage test still passes.

A fix removes an interpretation path or it does not land. "The regression is
fixed and the tests pass" is half an answer; the other half is **did this delete
a way of deciding, or add one?** A representation that has to mean several
things is the usual source of these bugs, and widening it with another flag or
another fallback leaves every existing reader intact and adds a reader. So when
a record cannot express a case, replace the record; when a lookup is reached by
two key shapes, finish the migration to one; when a completed decision is
ambiguous with an absent one, make completion record it; when a consumer
special-cases what a plan should have decided, move the decision into the plan.
Introducing a record, a small class, or a named reading is the preferred move
when it lets a reader see the rule in one place, and it does not need a separate
mandate: reach for it whenever it fixes the bug in fewer lines than another
branch would, and change an existing structure freely when replacing it is what
makes the code read more simply. Prefer that to a new condition threaded through
existing paths, which each reader then has to hold in mind. The one condition is
that the new thing is accepted only if it deletes the branches and helpers it
replaces — moving them to another module, or wrapping them behind a new name,
does not count. The practical test before committing: the file you changed
should be no harder to read than before, and the count of places that answer
your question should have gone down.

Keep the regressions while doing it. The tests that pin bare, `only`, renamed
and repeated `use` forms, route accessibility, transitive re-exports, merged
generics, prototype collisions, exact `__all__`, and source-build versus
generated-`.pyi` replay are the specification of what PRIK supports; simplify
what sits under them, never by dropping the cases they cover.

Where one decision reaches users through two artifacts, a test must compare
those artifacts rather than only check each one. A built extension and the
`.pyi` contract describing it are one such pair: each had passing tests while
the names they published disagreed, because nothing asserted that they agreed.
Treat the same comparison as a recommendation, not a requirement, for internal
pairs such as a wrapper plan and the sources generated from it. Watch for a
second policy or allocator instance, for a language, route, or flag gate at the
consumer that the owner lacks, and for a `prik/printers/` helper that returns a
name, kind, or decision rather than text.

To answer an ABI question, or to decide whether something belongs in the
binding or in the Fortran bridge, first ask: **how would this work for a
`bind(C)` procedure, where there is no bridge at all?** A direct entrypoint has
only the binding and the user's C ABI symbol, so whatever the direct route must
do is binding-owned by definition. The bridge then owns exactly the remainder:
the work that makes an ordinary non-`bind(C)` procedure reachable through that
same completed plan. Deriving the boundary this way keeps one shared entrypoint
contract for both routes instead of two parallel designs.

The question is still decisive when the form cannot be `bind(C)` at all. A
Fortran type that no interoperable interface can declare — a deferred-length
`character(len=:)` dummy, for example, which the standard rejects in a
`bind(C)` interface because character dummies there must have length 1 — proves
that a generated Fortran adapter is mandatory rather than optional, and names
what that adapter has to construct: the non-interoperable local the native
dummy requires. Record that reasoning with the completed policy so the bridge
implements a decided mechanism rather than rediscovering it.

After every implementation task, the final summary must include a breakdown of
the stages that actually changed. Relevant stages include parsing, semantic IR
construction, post-IR policy completion, wrapper planning/direct lowering, binding
generation, bridge generation, compilation/build integration, and
documentation. For each changed stage, state what behavior or representation
changed there. Do not include unchanged stages or empty stage headings. Also
identify the tests that were added or updated, where they live, what behavior
they cover, and the relevant verification results. When the implementation
reused or improved an existing code path, name that path and explain how it was
reused or changed. The stage breakdown is a required part of the summary, not a
restriction on the rest of it: add any relevant cross-cutting outcomes,
decisions, risks, limitations, verification gaps, or handoff details outside
the stage breakdown when they help explain the implementation.

Changes limited to wrapper planning, direct bridge/binding lowering, or native
compilation should use the focused owners under
`tests/fortran/infrastructure/codegen/`, feature-local
`tests/fortran/*/codegen/` directories, and
`tests/fortran/infrastructure/building/compiling/` as applicable. Include the
relevant end-to-end feature tests whenever a generated or compiled mechanism
changes; run a broader suite when behavior spans multiple stages.
Run ad-hoc compiler and build commands outside the repository root, for example in a temporary
directory, so no `.mod`, object, or library file lands there; the test session refuses to start
while native build artifacts sit in the root, since a stale one silently shadows a later build.
Run pytest with at most `-n 2`. Never `-n 4`, `-n 8`, or `-n auto`. The development machine has 12 cores but only about 7 GB of RAM, and every xdist worker loads NumPy while the Fortran end-to-end tests fork gfortran and cc per test on top of `pytest-monitor` profiling each one. Higher parallelism exhausts memory and thrashes swap, which has hard-frozen the machine and forced a reboot. Prefer the narrowest owning test path over a full suite run, and commit verified work promptly rather than batching it behind a long run.
Do not run LAPACK wrapper tests locally unless the user explicitly asks for them. Local verification may run everything else, including BLAS-only real-library tests; leave LAPACK coverage to GitHub Actions by default.
Do not run the full coverage workflow for routine changes. Run focused tests plus the required static-analysis suite. Reserve the complete CI-style coverage workflow for explicit pre-merge or pull-request verification, or when the user specifically requests it.
When investigating coverage failures, mirror the GitHub Actions workflow before deciding the fix: run coverage with `COVERAGE_PROCESS_START=pyproject.toml`, combine parallel data with `python3 -m coverage combine`, then run `python3 -m coverage report`. Do not assume a plain local coverage run matches CI, especially when subprocess tests are involved.
For documentation-only changes that do not modify executable Python code,
runtime behavior, build configuration, or test logic, do not run the complete
static-analysis suite by default. Run the focused documentation checks and
whitespace check instead:
- `python3 -m pytest -q tests/docs`
- `git diff --check`
Run the complete static-analysis suite when code, tests, build behavior, or
tooling configuration changes, or when explicitly requested for pre-merge or
pull-request verification:
- `python3 -m ruff check .`
- `python3 -m ruff format --check .`
- `python3 tools/check_static_analysis_versions.py`
- `python3 tools/check_codegen_complexity.py`
- `python3 -m bandit -c pyproject.toml -r prik --severity-level medium --confidence-level medium`
- `python3 -m vulture`
- `python3 tools/check_radon_policy.py --base-ref auto`
- `python3 -m radon cc prik -n C -s --total-average`
- `python3 -m radon mi prik -s`
Treat Ruff, Bandit, Vulture, and the Radon policy as blocking. The full Radon complexity and maintainability reports are advisory but must still be run. If a command cannot run because a dependency, network service, or CI-only environment value is unavailable, state that explicitly in the final response.

The codegen complexity checker is also advisory: review and report its findings,
but do not change correct behavior or fail the task solely to satisfy its
structural recommendations.
When you create a commit add this prefix to the message to know that you did push the commit "codex: ..."
