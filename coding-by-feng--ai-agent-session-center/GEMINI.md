# AI Agent Session Center: Agent Guidance

This file is the durable coding-agent entrypoint for this repository. It is
based on `CLAUDE.md`; read `CLAUDE.md` for the full architecture notes and keep
the two files aligned when project guidance changes.

## Project Snapshot

AI Agent Session Center is a localhost dashboard on port 3333 for monitoring AI
coding agent sessions from Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Codex, and related tools. It
uses hooks to ingest session events, visualizes sessions as 3D robots, supports
SSH terminals, team/subagent tracking, prompt queuing, workspace snapshots, and
session resume.

Core stack:

- Backend: Node.js 18+, ESM, Express 5, ws 8, tsx
- Frontend: React 19, Three.js / `@react-three/fiber`, Zustand 5, Vite 7
- Desktop: Electron 34, electron-builder 25
- Terminal: `node-pty` through Electron IPC, WebSocket fallback in browser
- Hooks: Bash hook script with JSONL file queue and HTTP POST fallback
- Persistence: SQLite / `better-sqlite3` on the server, IndexedDB / Dexie in the
  browser

## Common Commands

```bash
npm run dev              # Vite + tsx watch
npm run build            # Production build
npm start                # Start production server
npm test                 # Vitest
npm run test:e2e         # Playwright E2E
npm run test:coverage    # Coverage report
npm run typecheck        # tsc --noEmit
npm run lint             # ESLint src/
npm run format           # Prettier
npm run electron:dev     # Build and launch Electron app
npm run electron:build   # Build distributables
npm run install-hooks    # Install CLI hooks
npm run uninstall-hooks  # Remove dashboard hooks
npm run setup            # Interactive setup wizard
npm run reset            # Remove hooks, clean config, backup
```

Use the smallest verification command that fits the change. For shared contracts,
state shape, server routes, Electron IPC, terminal behavior, or feature-doc work,
prefer at least `npm run typecheck` plus any targeted tests that cover the touched
area.

## Feature Documentation Workflow

All feature logic is documented under `docs/feature/`. Before implementing a new
feature or modifying an existing one:

1. Read `CLAUDE.md` to identify the affected feature domain.
2. Read the corresponding doc(s) in `docs/feature/`.
3. Check the impact matrix in `CLAUDE.md` for connected features.
4. Read connected feature docs before changing shared behavior.
5. After the code change, update every affected feature doc.

`docs/feature/.manifest.json` is machine-readable source of truth for file to
doc mappings, symbols, and last-aligned timestamps. Do not hand-edit it. If it
drifts, run the feature-doc alignment workflow rather than patching the manifest
manually.

Feature-doc domains:

- `docs/feature/server/`: hooks, sessions, matching, approvals, WebSocket, API,
  database, terminal/SSH, teams, process monitoring, auth, file index cache, and
  floating session spawning
- `docs/feature/frontend/`: Zustand state, persistence, WebSocket client,
  session detail, conversation/file/terminal/queue/review views, settings,
  shortcuts, command autocomplete, workspace snapshots, setup, auth UI, project
  browser, floating terminals, creation modals, and UI primitives
- `docs/feature/3d/`: cyberdrome scene, robot system, particles/effects
- `docs/feature/multimedia/`: sound/alarm and TTS voice output
- `docs/feature/electron/`: app lifecycle, PTY host, and IPC transport

## Architecture Notes

Event flow:

```text
AI CLI
  -> hooks/dashboard-hook.sh
  -> /tmp/claude-session-center/queue.jsonl
  -> server/mqReader.ts
  -> server/hookProcessor.ts
  -> server/sessionStore.ts
  -> server/wsManager.ts
  -> browser Zustand stores and React render
```

Important server areas:

- `server/index.ts`: orchestration and startup
- `server/apiRouter.ts`: REST API surface
- `server/mqReader.ts`, `server/hookProcessor.ts`, `server/hookRouter.ts`: hook
  ingestion and routing
- `server/sessionStore.ts` and helpers: session state, matching, titles,
  approvals, teams, liveness, and auto-idle
- `server/wsManager.ts`: WebSocket broadcast and terminal relay
- `server/sshManager.ts`: SSH/PTY terminal management
- `server/db.ts`: SQLite storage
- `server/authManager.ts`: password auth and tokens
- `server/floatingSessionSpawner.ts`, `server/floatingPrompt.ts`,
  `server/extractPreviousAnswer.ts`: floating/forked session support

Important frontend areas:

- `src/stores/`: Zustand state stores for session, settings, queue, room,
  camera, UI, WebSocket, agenda, shortcuts, and floating sessions
- `src/hooks/`: WebSocket, terminal, sound, auth, shortcuts, settings init,
  workspace auto-save/load, queue scheduler, selection popup, and outside-click
  behavior
- `src/lib/`: client transport, IndexedDB, audio, workspace snapshots, CLI
  detection, scene utilities, file system provider, formatting, shortcuts,
  transcript, queue scheduling, history export, command suggestions, and TTS
- `src/components/3d/`: scene, robots, labels, particles, camera, overlays, and
  3D state display
- `src/components/session/`: detail panel, tabs, conversation, project/file
  browser, floating panels, queue/history, notes, summaries, linkified text,
  dialogs, TeX/image viewers
- `src/components/terminal/`: terminal container, toolbar, themes
- `src/components/settings/`, `src/components/modals/`, `src/components/layout/`,
  `src/components/agenda/`, `src/components/auth/`, `src/components/setup/`,
  `src/components/ui/`: domain UI and shared primitives
- `src/routes/`: live, history, project browser, queue, agenda, and review views

Electron uses `electron/main.ts` for app lifecycle and windows,
`electron/preload.ts` for the context bridge, `electron/ptyHost.ts` for the
Node PTY host with ring buffer replay, and `electron/ipc/` for IPC handlers.
Terminal transport is IPC in Electron and WebSocket in browser; renderer code
detects Electron through `window.electronAPI?.createPty`.

## Session State Machine

Session state drives the 3D robots, sounds, approvals, auto-idle, and session UI.
Treat changes here as cross-cutting:

```text
SessionStart      -> idle       (idle animation)
UserPromptSubmit  -> prompting  (walking/wave, seeks desk)
PreToolUse        -> working    (running, tool-specific animation)
PostToolUse       -> working    (stays working)
[timeout]         -> approval   (waiting for tool approval)
[timeout]         -> input      (waiting for user answer)
PermissionRequest -> approval   (reliable signal, overrides heuristic)
Stop              -> waiting    (thumbs up / dance)
[2 min idle]      -> idle
SessionEnd        -> ended      (death animation, kept in memory)
```

## High-Risk Change Areas

Check connected docs and tests when touching these contracts:

- Hook script or MQ format affects session matching, management, and hook stats.
- Session state changes affect robots, sound/alarms, approvals, auto-idle, and
  frontend stores.
- WebSocket messages affect the WS client, terminal UI, and real-time UI.
- API contracts affect frontend HTTP calls and Electron PTY registration.
- DB schema affects API endpoints and IndexedDB mirroring.
- Terminal/SSH behavior affects session matching and PTY registration.
- Zustand store shape changes affect all subscribing components.
- Theme CSS variables affect 2D UI, 3D UI, and terminal themes.
- Electron IPC channel changes affect preload and terminal transport.
- Queue scheduler or `queueHistoryStore` changes affect prompt queue, loops,
  per-session automation, and client persistence.
- Transcript reconstruction affects conversation view and review tab.
- Floating session spawn/fork changes affect floating terminal fork, review tab,
  pop-out windows, and session matching.
- Shared UI primitives affect settings, modals, panels, and any consumer.
- TTS or Google Cloud API-key work must keep per-user API keys client-side and
  forwarded per request. Do not reintroduce ambient credentials such as gcloud
  ADC or service-account files.

## Key Invariants

- Never mutate session objects in place; create new objects and Maps.
- Never use Zustand directly inside React Three Fiber Canvas code; pass data from
  DOM layers through props to avoid React Error #185.
- Never block the hook script; background processing with a detached subshell.
- Never hardcode port 3333; read from config, env, or CLI flags.
- Never modify `~/.claude/settings.json` without an atomic temp-write and rename.
- Server imports use `.js` extensions for NodeNext module resolution with tsx.
- File browser path access must go through `resolveProjectPath()`.
- SSH inputs must stay validated with Zod and shell-metacharacter checks.

## Editing Expectations

- Follow existing local patterns before adding abstractions.
- Keep behavior changes narrow and update docs when user-facing features,
  backend endpoints, UI components, shortcuts, or architecture patterns change.
- Preserve unrelated worktree changes; inspect current diffs before editing.
- Use structured parsers and existing helpers instead of ad hoc string handling
  when the project already has a suitable utility.
- For frontend changes, verify the rendered app when feasible, especially for 3D,
  Electron, terminal, or responsive layout work.
