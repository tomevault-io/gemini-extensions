## Tool Routing — Which Tool Wins When They Overlap

| Situation | Use This | Ignore This |
|---|---|---|
| Pre-code product/business decisions | `/office-hours` (gstack) | — |
| Ideation — discover what to build | `/ce:ideate` (CE) | — |
| Brainstorming requirements | `/ce:brainstorm` (CE) | Superpowers `brainstorming`, `/office-hours` (use for pure product questions) |
| Creating an implementation plan | `/ce:plan` (CE) | `/gsd:plan-phase`, `/plan` command |
| Reviewing a plan after planning | `/autoplan` (gstack) or `/document-review` (CE) | — |
| Executing a plan | `/ce:work` (CE) | `/gsd:execute-phase` |
| Full autonomous workflow | `/lfg` or `/slfg` (CE) | `/gsd:autonomous` |
| Enforcing TDD | Superpowers `test-driven-development` (auto) | `/tdd` command (manual fallback) |
| Automated QA with browser | `/qa` (gstack) | `/test-browser` (CE, for PR-scoped browser tests) |
| Code review before merge | `/ce:review` (CE) | `/review` (gstack), `/codex` |
| Live visual design audit | `/design-review` (gstack) | `/gsd:ui-review` (fallback if no browser) |
| Frontend implementation | `/frontend-design` (CE) | `/gsd:ui-phase` (fallback) |
| Acceptance testing | `/gsd:verify-work` | — |
| Committing changes | `/git-commit` (CE) | — |
| Full release (commit → PR) | `/git-commit-push-pr` (CE) | `/ship` (gstack, for version bumps + CHANGELOG) |
| Deployment + canary | `/land-and-deploy` → `/canary` (gstack) | — |
| Performance regression | `/benchmark` (gstack) | — |
| Production debugging | `/investigate` (gstack) | `/gsd:debug` (dev-time), `/reproduce-bug` (CE, from GitHub issues) |
| Weekly retrospective | `/retro` (gstack) | — |
| Quick one-off task | `/gsd:quick` or `/plan` | Don't start full GSD lifecycle |
| Document learnings | `/ce:compound` (CE) | — |
| Resolve PR feedback | `/resolve-pr-feedback` (CE) | — |
| Safety during risky operations | `/careful` + `/guard` (gstack) | — |

**The rule:** CE owns the feature lifecycle (brainstorm → plan → work → review → compound). gstack owns the release pipeline and live-site tools. GSD provides project scaffolding, state management, and session continuity. Superpowers enforces TDD in-task.

## TDD Mandate

Always RED-GREEN-REFACTOR. No exceptions.
- Write the failing test FIRST
- Watch it fail (never skip this step)
- Write minimum code to pass
- 80%+ test coverage required
- Never commit without passing tests

---

## Agent Pipeline (for every feature)

```
gsd-planner → gsd-phase-researcher → gsd-executor → gsd-verifier → gsd-nyquist-auditor
```

For code quality: `gsd-plan-checker → gsd-integration-checker`
For UI: add `gsd-ui-researcher → gsd-ui-auditor → gsd-ui-checker`

---

## Context Management

- Main session orchestrates ONLY — no heavy implementation in main context
- Keep main context at 30-40% utilization
- Spawn subagents for: tasks touching >10 files, parallelizable work, deep research
- At context limit: `/gsd:pause-work` → start fresh session → `/gsd:resume-work`

---

## Model Selection

| Model | When |
|---|---|
| `haiku` | Simple lookups, boilerplate, log parsing |
| `sonnet` | Default for all implementation (90% of time) |
| `opus` | Architecture decisions, security reviews, complex reasoning |

Switch profiles: `/gsd:set-profile quality` (opus) | `balanced` (default) | `budget` (haiku)

---

## Token Efficiency

- `MAX_THINKING_TOKENS=10000`
- Manual compaction before context fills: `/gsd:session-report` → start fresh
- Use `/gsd:map-codebase` to produce codebase docs instead of reading all files inline

---

## Security

- OWASP Top 10 compliance required
- No hardcoded secrets — always use environment variables
- Run `gsd-nyquist-auditor` on any commit touching auth, APIs, data handling
- Security findings require a fix, never a waiver

---

## UI/UX Work

1. `/gsd:ui-phase` — generates UI-SPEC.md design contract
2. Activate ui-ux-pro-max skill (auto-triggers on UI prompts)
3. Implement against the design contract with TDD
4. `/gsd:ui-review` — 6-pillar audit (hierarchy, typography, color, spacing, interaction, a11y)
5. Fix all findings before commit

---

## Commit Discipline

Format: `<type>(<scope>): <description>`
Types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `test`, `docs`, `chore`

- One logical task = one commit
- No `--no-verify` ever
- Reference plan task in commit body for non-trivial changes
- Use `/gsd:pr-branch` for clean PR branches (filters `.planning/` commits)

---

## Evidence-Over-Claims Rule

Never declare done based on reasoning alone. Required evidence:
- Tests: run suite, show passing output
- Features: demonstrate working behavior
- Fixes: show error is gone with reproduction steps
- Builds: show build succeeds
