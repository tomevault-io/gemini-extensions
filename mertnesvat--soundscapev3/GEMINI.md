- **Language**: Swift 5.0
- **UI Framework**: SwiftUI
- **Architecture**: Clean Architecture (Domain, Data, Presentation layers)
- **State Management**: @Observable, @Environment
- **Audio**: AVFoundation, AVAudioEngine (for binaural beats)
- **Persistence**: UserDefaults, JSON files
- **Build System**: Xcode project (not SPM)

## Key Services

| Service | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `AudioEngine` | Multi-sound playback, volume control, session tracking |
| `SleepTimerService` | Countdown timer with fade-out |
| `InsightsService` | Usage analytics, session recording |
| `FavoritesService` | Persist favorite sounds |
| `SavedMixesService` | Save/load sound combinations |
| `BinauralBeatEngine` | Generate binaural/isochronic tones |
| `AlarmService` | Schedule wake-up alarms |
| `AdaptiveSessionService` | Context-aware sound transitions |

## Sound Categories

| Category | Color | Sounds |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Noise | Purple | White Noise, Pink Noise, Brown Noise, Deep Brown Noise |
| Nature | Green | Morning Birds, Winter Forest, Serene Morning, Spring Birds, Meadow, Night Wildlife, Calm Ocean |
| Weather | Blue | Rain Storm, Wind Ambient, Rainforest, Thunder, Heavy Thunder, Castle Wind |
| Fire | Orange | Campfire, Bonfire |
| Music | Pink | Creative Mind, Midnight Calm, Ocean Lullaby, Deep Focus Flow, Starlit Sky, Forest Sanctuary, Cinematic Piano, Ambient Melody |

## Tab Structure (7 tabs)

1. **Sounds** - Main library with Mixer/Timer/Saved as toolbar sheet modals
2. **Binaural** - Brainwave entrainment tones
3. **Wind Down** - Sleep content and stories
4. **Sleep Rec** - Sleep recording
5. **Discover** - Community-curated mixes
6. **Adaptive** - Context-aware soundscapes
7. **Insights** - Sleep analytics dashboard

## Build Commands

```bash
# Build
cd SoundScape && xcodebuild -scheme SoundScape -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17 Pro' build

# Run in simulator
xcrun simctl install "iPhone 17 Pro" build/Build/Products/Debug-iphonesimulator/SoundScape.app
xcrun simctl launch "iPhone 17 Pro" com.StudioNext.SoundScape
```

## Adding New Sounds

1. Add MP3 file to `Resources/Sounds/`
2. Add entry to `LocalSoundDataSource.swift` with id, name, category, fileName
3. Add file reference to `SoundScape.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`:
   - PBXBuildFile section
   - PBXFileReference section
   - Sounds group children
   - PBXResourcesBuildPhase files
4. Update `SoundCardView.swift` and `MixerSoundRowView.swift` if new category

## Key Patterns

- Services are `@Observable` classes injected via `.environment()`
- Views access services via `@Environment(ServiceName.self)`
- Sound playback is managed by `AudioEngine.activeSounds`
- Sessions recorded to `InsightsService` when timer ends or sounds stop

## Design Context

### Users
Bedtime users seeking relief from the day — people who want to fall asleep faster, focus better, or decompress. They open the app when they're tired, often in a dark room. Speed and calm matter: they need to get their soundscape running with minimal friction, then put the phone down.

### Brand Personality
**Modern, Sleek, Technical** — a precision instrument for sleep, not a whimsical toy. Think Endel's generative minimalism: abstract, dark, flowing. The interface should feel like a well-engineered tool that disappears into the background.

### Emotional Goals
- **Instant calm & relief** — tension dissolves the moment the app opens; the day is over
- **Cozy comfort** — warmth and safety, like crawling into fresh sheets

### Aesthetic Direction
- **Dark-first**: OLED black backgrounds with purple accent (#7F6FD8) and category-coded colors
- **Generative & abstract**: Flowing liquid visualizations, particle systems, wave layers — not literal nature photos
- **Minimal chrome**: Let content and audio breathe; reduce visual noise
- **Reference**: Endel — abstract, generative, minimal dark UI with flowing visuals
- **Anti-pattern**: Avoid cluttered dashboards, bright whites, or playful/cartoonish elements

### Design Principles
1. **Calm by default** — Every pixel should lower cortisol. No jarring transitions, no competing elements, no visual anxiety.
2. **Dark is home** — OLED black is the primary canvas. Color is intentional and category-coded. Light is used sparingly as accent and glow.
3. **Disappearing UI** — The best interaction is the shortest one. Get to playback fast, then get out of the way.
4. **Contrast matters** — Enhanced contrast ratios in dark mode. Text and interactive elements must be clearly legible against dark backgrounds without being harsh.
5. **Motion with purpose** — Animations serve comprehension (state changes, feedback) or atmosphere (visualizations). Never decorative jank.

### Design Tokens (Current)
| Token | Values |
|-------|--------|
| Accent | #7F6FD8 (purple) |
| Corner Radius | 16 (cards), 12 (buttons), 8 (badges) |
| Primary Padding | 24 (edges), 16 (standard), 12 (compact) |
| Shadow (OLED) | category color glow, radius 8-16 |
| Spring Animation | response 0.3-0.6, damping 0.6-0.7 |
| Font Weights | .thin (display), .medium (body), .bold (headers) |
