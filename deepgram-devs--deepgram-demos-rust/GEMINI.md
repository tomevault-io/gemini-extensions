# Flux Turn-Taking Client (dg-flux) Implementation Notes

## Product Direction

`dg-flux` is a Rust CLI client for Deepgram's **Flux** streaming speech-to-text API
(`/v2/listen`, model `flux-general-en`). It exists to exercise and demonstrate Flux's
turn-taking behavior — it is **not** a bidirectional Voice Agent example, and it never
sends or expects audio back from Deepgram.

It supports two input modes, selected as subcommands:

- `microphone` - streams live audio captured from the default input device
- `file` - decodes an audio file (WAV, MP3, M4A, AAC via Symphonia) and streams it back
  at real-time speed (100ms chunks, sized to the decoded sample rate)

Both subcommands accept the same superset of Flux-related options and share the same
connection, transcript-display, and statistics machinery.

## Output Modes Are Mutually Exclusive

There are three top-level output modes. Exactly one is active per run, in this priority
order:

1. **`--verbose`** - prints the full raw JSON for every message on every connection.
   Overrides `--stats` and the regular transcript output.
2. **`--stats`** - prints a periodic (500ms), full-redraw statistics table across all
   connections (bytes sent/received, and Flux event counts). Suppresses the transcript
   output for the selected connection, since a full-screen redraw loop and printed
   transcript lines would otherwise clobber each other on the terminal.
3. **Default (neither flag passed)** - prints the transcript for a single selected
   connection only (`--connection`, default `0`, the first connection spawned). Other
   connections keep streaming and updating their counters in the background but produce
   no output of their own.

Do not make `--stats` and the transcript output run concurrently, and do not make the
transcript output default to "all connections" — both were tried and both fight over the
same terminal region (the stats table clears the screen and redraws from the cursor's
home position every tick).

## Transcript Line Format

Each turn (`turn_index`) occupies exactly one terminal line in the default (regular)
output mode. Every Flux `TurnInfo` message for that turn redraws the line in place —
move to column 0, clear the current line, then print:

```
<EventName>: <transcript>[ <confidence suffix>]
```

- `<EventName>` is the Flux `event` field, one of `StartOfTurn`, `Update`,
  `EagerEndOfTurn`, `TurnResumed`, `EndOfTurn` (see `TurnEvent` in `src/main.rs`).
- `<transcript>` is the message's `transcript` field, printed verbatim (not word-diffed)
  — Flux resends the full transcript-so-far for the turn on every message, not just the
  new words, so redrawing the whole line each time is both simpler and more correct than
  trying to append only a computed delta (which would break if Flux ever revises earlier
  words instead of purely appending).
- The confidence suffix only appears on `EagerEndOfTurn` (`[eager_eot_confidence: X.XXXX]`)
  and `EndOfTurn` (`[eot_confidence: X.XXXX]`) redraws, sourced from the message's
  `end_of_turn_confidence` field. Other event types never get a confidence suffix, even if
  Flux happens to include that field on them.

The line is only finalized with a trailing newline when the turn actually ends
(`event == EndOfTurn`) or when a new turn begins (`turn_index` changes) — do not print a
newline after every message; that was tried and produced one scrolling line per message
instead of a single line that updates in place per turn.

Color is keyed off `turn_index % colors.len()` (not an incrementing counter), applied
immediately before each redraw and reset immediately after. Color must never be applied
to the statistics table — `display_stats_table` defensively issues a `ResetColor` before
drawing, specifically to guard against a transcript line's color still being active when
the table redraws on its own timer.

## Flux Message Schema

Flux's WebSocket schema differs from Nova-3 streaming and must not be confused with it:

- The top-level `type` field is one of `Connected`, `TurnInfo`, `ConfigureSuccess`,
  `ConfigureFailure`, or `Error`. Flux does **not** send separate `Results`,
  `SpeechStarted`, `UtteranceEnd`, or `Metadata` message types the way Nova-3 does.
- All transcription and turn-state updates arrive as `TurnInfo` messages; the actual
  turn-state transition lives in the nested `event` field (`TurnEvent` enum), not in
  `type`.
- `TurnEvent` has a `#[serde(other)] Unknown` catch-all variant. Keep it — it lets the
  client keep parsing forward-compatibly if Flux ever adds a new event value, instead of
  hard-failing JSON parsing for every message on the connection.
- `eager_eot_threshold` (0.3-0.9) and `numerals` are the only two query-string options
  this client sets on connect. `numerals` must be set at connect time; Flux does not
  support toggling it mid-stream via a `Configure` message. `eager_eot_threshold` could in
  principle be changed via `Configure`, but this client only ever sets it at connect time.

## CLI Surface

Flags shared by both `microphone` and `file` (see `src/main.rs` `Commands` enum for the
authoritative list and current defaults):

- `--numerals` - adds `numerals=true` to the connect URL
- `--eager-eot-threshold` / `--eeot` (0.3-0.9) - adds `eager_eot_threshold=<value>` to the
  connect URL when set; validated client-side before connecting
- `--connection <N>` (default `0`) - which connection's transcript to print in the
  default output mode; validated against `--threads` before connecting
- `--stats` - see "Output Modes" above
- `--verbose` / `-v` - see "Output Modes" above
- `--threads <N>` (default `1`) - number of concurrent connections, for load testing
- `--endpoint`, `--sample-rate`, `--encoding`, `--inactivity-timeout` - connection-level
  overrides; `file` mode ignores `--sample-rate` in favor of the audio's detected rate

When adding a new Flux-facing option, follow the `eager_eot_threshold` pattern: thread it
through `connect_to_deepgram` → `run_thread_worker` → `run_microphone`/`run_file` →
`main`, validate it client-side if Flux has a documented valid range, and only append it
to the connect URL when the user actually passed it (don't send Flux a default it didn't
ask for).

## Shutdown Behavior

Pressing Ctrl+C during `microphone` mode must exit immediately — drop the audio stream,
sender, and thread handles, then `std::process::exit(0)` without waiting for worker
threads to join. Do not reintroduce a bounded join-with-timeout on the Ctrl+C path; that
was tried and made the user wait up to 2 seconds (or the inactivity timeout) after
asking the app to stop right now.

## Maintenance

- Keep `README.md` in sync with every CLI-visible change: new flags, changed defaults,
  updated example commands, and the sample output/table screenshots in "Output Examples".
- Keep `CHANGELOG.md` up to date under an `[Unreleased]` (or next version) heading as
  functionality changes, per the repository root `AGENTS.md` release guidance.
- Releases are published through `.github/workflows/dg-flux-release.yml`, matching the
  `velocity` and `tts-tui` pattern: it builds native binaries on GitHub-hosted runners for
  `aarch64-apple-darwin`, `x86_64-apple-darwin`, `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`, and
  `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`, packages each with `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and the root
  `LICENSE.md`, and creates the GitHub release from those artifacts. Do not rely on local
  cross-compilation for release artifacts.
- When cutting a release: bump `version` in `Cargo.toml`, add a `## [x.y.z] - YYYY-MM-DD`
  section to `CHANGELOG.md` (the release workflow extracts that section verbatim as the
  release notes — keep the heading format consistent with existing entries), update
  `Cargo.lock`, and update `README.md` for any user-visible change.
- After merging a release-ready update, push an annotated tag named `dg-flux-v<version>`
  matching `Cargo.toml`. Verify the workflow's build job succeeds for all four targets and
  the release job successfully creates or updates the GitHub release before considering
  the release complete.
- Keep this `AGENTS.md` file updated with functional changes
