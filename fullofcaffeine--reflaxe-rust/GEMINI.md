## Issue Tracking

This project uses **bd (beads)** for issue tracking.

- `bd prime` — workflow context
- `bd ready` — unblocked work
- `bd show <id>` — details
- `bd update <id> --claim` — claim
- `bd close <id>` — complete
- `bd export -o .beads/issues.jsonl` — write the git-tracked issue export from the embedded DB
- `bd dolt push` / `bd dolt pull` — sync the embedded Dolt DB once a remote is configured

Gotcha: `bd` DB state and `.beads/issues.jsonl` can drift because the JSONL file is an explicit export of the embedded Dolt database.
Before committing bead status changes, run `bd export -o .beads/issues.jsonl` and ensure `.beads/issues.jsonl` is included in the commit when modified.
- Modern Beads migration gotcha: this repo has been migrated to the embedded Dolt backend (`bd context` should report `Backend: dolt`, `mode: embedded`).
  Do not use legacy direct SQLite-style `bd --db .beads/beads.db ...` commands; they can open an empty legacy database and remove/hide the JSONL export.
  If recovery is needed, first copy `.beads/issues.jsonl` to a temp path, then run `bd init --from-jsonl --reinit-local --prefix haxe.rust --skip-agents --skip-hooks --non-interactive`
  and verify `bd status` matches the JSONL counts before mutating issues.
  The modern backend normalizes the configured prefix to `haxe_rust`; when adding children to the historical `haxe.rust-*` roadmap, use explicit IDs with `bd create --force --id ...`.

Milestone plan lives in Beads under epic `haxe.rust-oo3` (see `bd graph haxe.rust-oo3 --compact`).

## Thinking Levels (Bead Labels)

Use a `thinking:*` label on active beads so execution effort matches task risk.

- `thinking:low`
  - Mechanical edits, simple docs cleanup, straightforward renames, obvious wiring.
- `thinking:medium`
  - CI/job plumbing, runner scripts, artifact flow, bounded retry/timeout logic.
- `thinking:high`
  - Parity contracts, gate semantics, dependency graph changes, perf-policy changes, compiler/runtime architecture decisions.
- `thinking:xhigh`
  - Scope-definition changes, release enforcement, provenance-sensitive implementation strategy, or any task where a wrong decision would create misleading 1.0 evidence.

Agent policy:

- When a bead has a `thinking:*` label, match reasoning depth to that label automatically.
- If a claimed bead has no `thinking:*` label, infer one immediately and add it before substantial work.
- `thinking:xhigh` should get a second-pass review before closure.
  - Preferred: an Oracle checkpoint/review.
    - Default Oracle workflow: prepare a detailed prompt for GPT-5.5 Pro in the web UI, including the review questions, relevant file paths, Beads IDs/commands, and any repo bundles to upload (for example a repomix archive). Give that prompt to the user to paste, wait for the user to paste the reply back, then incorporate the findings.
    - Do not use a subagent for Oracle-style review unless the user explicitly asks for one.
  - Acceptable fallback: an explicit written second-pass design review recorded in the bead comments.
- Oracle is a review/escalation tool for `thinking:xhigh`; it is not a substitute for implementation, tests, or CI evidence.

## Product Source of Truth

- Requirements + architecture: `prd.md`
- Target: **Haxe 4.3.7 → Rust** via Reflaxe

## Strategic Goal

- Primary long-term goal: make `reflaxe.rust` the best way to write production Rust outside of writing raw Rust directly, by combining Haxe ergonomics with Rust-level performance, safety, and readability, while preserving an explicit portable path through Haxe when users want cross-target portability.

## Typeful Haxe and Rust Output Quality

- Treat well-typed Haxe as the source language contract. Compiler, runtime, std overrides, tests, and examples should use concrete types, `typedef` schemas, abstracts/newtypes, enum abstracts, typed enums, and GADT-style typed enum patterns where Haxe can express them. Avoid strings as domain models when a stronger representation is practical.
- Keep stringly typed values at real boundaries only: JSON/protocol IO, CLI/env/filesystem inputs, metadata names, target syntax tokens, or upstream API compatibility points. Convert those values into typed structures immediately after the boundary and keep downstream code typed.
- Use macros when they improve correctness or maintainability: deriving repetitive validators/bridges, centralizing typed target metadata, enforcing profile/runtime contracts, or preventing schema drift. Avoid clever macro machinery whose generated shape is hard to inspect, hard to test, or harder for haxe.rust to lower cleanly.
- Adapt Rust/Codex-style architecture into Haxe idioms rather than mechanically mirroring Rust. Prefer Haxe abstractions that make invalid states unrepresentable while still giving the backend enough typed information to emit native Rust.
- For any Haxe-to-target compiler or framework layer, target compatibility is the floor, not the Haxe API design ceiling. Target-shaped Haxe APIs are fine when they are intentional and documented for migration, native interop, predictable lowering, performance, ownership, borrowing, or escape-hatch use. Keep 1:1 Rust-shaped facades available where they help users reason about the emitted target, but default canonical APIs to Haxe's strengths: strong types, abstracts, macros, generated references, properties, completion, and compile-time diagnostics. Prefer semantic Haxe wrappers when they improve readability or safety without changing Rust behavior or hiding target costs.
- Generated Rust quality is a first-class product requirement in every profile. Output should be readable, idiomatic, warning-clean, rustfmt-friendly, and close to hand-written Rust performance and runtime footprint wherever Haxe semantics permit. `hxrt` should remain lightweight and used only where semantics require runtime support.
- Stdlib lowering should prefer direct, idiomatic, efficient Rust or the thinnest typed runtime primitive that preserves the Haxe std contract. Do not route std APIs through broad runtime layers, dynamic handles, or allocation-heavy adapters just because it is easier to bind; use `hxrt` only when it is required for semantics, ownership/non-clone handles, platform abstraction, or shared safety checks. When `hxrt` is required, keep the helper narrow, typed, low-overhead, and shaped like hand-written Rust. If a stdlib API currently needs a heavier runtime path, track or fix that as a generic compiler/runtime improvement rather than normalizing the overhead.
- Generated Rust quality must be actively inspected for new compiler/runtime boundaries, not merely inferred from successful compilation. When a change introduces a new abstraction, lowering path, native facade, or runtime helper, review the emitted Rust shape and keep it warning-clean, rustfmt-friendly, and close to hand-written Rust in ownership, allocation, trait/object use, and module layout. Avoid adding Haxe-facing artifacts, compatibility wrappers, or runtime helpers unless they carry a real typed contract, remove meaningful duplication, or preserve required Haxe semantics; delete scaffolding once its temporary purpose is gone.
- Expose low-level Rust authority through typed Haxe surfaces and generic backend primitives. Native handles, RAII guards, ownership/borrow-shaped references, process/socket/terminal/SQLite primitives, and zero/low-copy data flow should be available through documented externs, metal/native facades, `rust.*` primitives, or compiler-supported abstractions rather than through app-side `Dynamic`, stringly escape hatches, raw generated-Rust edits, or project-specific `__rust__` snippets. If a consumer needs a Rust primitive that haxe.rust cannot express cleanly yet, treat it as a generic compiler/runtime feature gap with tests and docs.
- If typeful, idiomatic Haxe produces poor, noisy, clone-heavy, stringly, or runtime-heavy Rust, treat that as a generic compiler/runtime gap. Fix the lowering, planner, runtime API, or printer with generic tests instead of teaching consumers to contort source code around compiler artifacts.

## Core Guardrails (compiler)

- Keep the pipeline **AST-first**: Builder → Transformer passes → Printer (avoid string-gen except at the printer).
- Prefer typed analysis + passes over regex/string heuristics.
- Architecture policy: when warnings/regressions come from emitted Rust shape (lowering/printer artifacts),
  fix the compiler pass/lowering logic instead of relying on style-level source workarounds (for example rewriting app code to avoid explicit `return` in lambdas).
- Workaround policy (strict): do not land temporary workarounds. Fix the root cause in compiler/runtime lowering and add or update regression coverage in the same change.
- Portable mode first; keep a single runtime abstraction point so backends can evolve (e.g., `HxRef<T>`).
- Prefer `import` (and small local `typedef` aliases when appropriate) to avoid verbose fully-qualified type paths in compiler code
  (example: avoid `reflaxe.rust.ast.RustAST.RustMatchArm` when `import reflaxe.rust.ast.RustAST.RustMatchArm` lets you use `RustMatchArm`).
- Prefer strong typing: avoid `Dynamic` in compiler/runtime/examples unless the upstream Haxe API forces it (for example `haxe.Json.parse`, cross-thread message payloads, exception catch-alls).
  When you must cross a `Dynamic` boundary, immediately validate/cast/convert into a typed structure (often a `typedef` schema) and keep the rest of the code typed.
- `Dynamic` policy (strict): use `Dynamic` only when explicitly justified by upstream std/API contracts or unavoidable runtime boundaries.
  Default to concrete `typedef`/class/abstract/external bindings and leverage Haxe’s type system end-to-end.
- `Reflect`/`Any` policy (strict): avoid `Reflect.*` APIs and `Any`-typed payloads in first-party compiler/runtime/example code.
  Prefer typed fields/enums/interfaces; if an upstream/runtime boundary forces `Reflect` or `Any`, keep it tightly scoped and convert back to typed data immediately.
- Compatibility policy (stable releases): avoid silent breakage.
  For intentional breaking changes, require explicit migration notes in docs and linked Beads issues.
- For unavoidable stdlib API boundaries, prefer a descriptive `typedef` alias module (for example `*Types.cross.hx`)
  so raw `Dynamic` is centralized and documented instead of scattered across implementation files.
- Path privacy policy: never disclose machine-specific absolute local paths (for example `<home>/...`).
  Always use repository-relative paths; for sibling repos, use relative references like `../haxe.elixir.reference`.

## Meta (keep instructions current)

- When a new “gotcha”, policy decision, or workflow trick is discovered, write it down in the **closest scoped `AGENTS.md`** (add one if needed), not just in chat.
- Fix/test policy: after each fix, update tests and/or add a regression test (snapshots, runtime tests, or example test harness), unless an existing test update already covers the behavior change.
- Contract-first TDD policy (strict): for non-trivial compiler/runtime/std behavior changes, start by adding/updating the expected test contract first (snapshot, negative fixture, policy/harness assertion), confirm failure, then implement and re-run targeted checks plus full harness.
  For deterministic report/artifact features, include repeatability assertions (run twice, compare outputs byte-for-byte) in CI guards.
- Killer-app QA cadence: after any important complex task or milestone that changes compiler lowering, runtime behavior, std overrides, profile policy, report schemas, generated Rust shape, or metal/portable semantics, run `npm run test:codex-hxrust` when the sibling `codex-hxrust` checkout is available. Treat it as the local app-level pressure test for this compiler, not as a replacement for focused fixtures. If it is skipped, state the reason in the final response or Beads evidence. For small docs-only/mechanical edits, this QA is optional.
- Escalation visibility rule: when a task crosses the threshold for extended thinking or Oracle review, say so explicitly in chat before escalating.
  Do not silently switch into a deeper-thinking or Oracle-needed path; call out why the escalation is warranted and what question it is meant to resolve.

## Documentation (HaxeDoc)

- For any **vital** or **complex** type/function (compiler, runtime, `std/` interop surface), write **didactic HaxeDoc** using a clear **Why / What / How** structure.
- Documentation threshold rule: do not reserve HaxeDoc only for obviously "big" constructs or artifacts.
  If a type/function/abstract/macro/extern override/metadata pattern is even slightly non-obvious, surprising, or easy to misuse, document it with **Why / What / How** HaxeDoc where it is declared.
  For non-code artifacts that need explanation (generated report schemas, fixture formats, CI-facing outputs), document them at the closest emission point or owning docs page with the same **Why / What / How** standard.
- Be intentionally verbose when it prevents misuse (ownership/borrowing, injection rules, Cargo metadata, `@:coreType`/extern semantics, etc.).
- If you use a **non-trivial Haxe feature** (extern overrides, abstracts, `@:from/@:to`, macros, metadata-driven behavior, `@:native`, `@:coreType`, `@:enum abstract`, typed-ast patterns, etc.), add **comprehensive** HaxeDoc explaining why it exists and how it affects codegen/runtime semantics.
- This repo is a **reference compiler** for backend authors: every non-obvious compiler/runtime/std design decision should be documented where it lives, with explicit tradeoffs and rationale that other Haxe compiler implementers can follow.
- Boundary rule: whenever code crosses an unavoidable dynamic/native boundary (`Dynamic`, `extern`, `untyped __rust__`, runtime FFI), add HaxeDoc that states **why the boundary is required**, what typed shape is expected on each side, and how callers should return to typed code immediately after crossing it.
- Treat docs as part of the stability contract: if behavior changes, update the relevant HaxeDoc and (when applicable) `docs/*.md` + snapshots.

## Prior Art (local reference repos)

- Use `../haxe.elixir.reference` for patterns/APIs we previously used for the Haxe→Elixir target.
- Use `../haxe.elixir.codex` for the original Haxe→Elixir compiler implementation (**read-only; do not modify anything in that repo**).

## Important Lessons (POC)

- Reflaxe’s `Context.getMainExpr()` is only reliable when the consumer uses `-main <Class>` (don’t rely on a bare trailing `Main` line in `.hxml`).
- Use `BaseCompiler.setExtraFile()` for non-`.rs` outputs like `Cargo.toml` (the default OutputManager always appends `fileOutputExtension` for normal outputs).
- Haxe “multi-type modules” behave like `haxe.macro.Expr.*`: types in `RustAST.hx` are addressed as `RustAST.RustExpr`, `RustAST.RustFile`, etc.
- Keep generated Rust rustfmt-clean: avoid embedding extra trailing newlines in raw items and always end files with a final newline.
- Lint hygiene policy (default): snake_case all emitted members + locals/args, trim code after diverging ops (`throw/return/break/continue`), omit unused catch vars / unused `self_` params, and add crate-level `#![allow(dead_code)]` to keep `cargo build` warning-free.
  - Rust lint gotcha: emit `loop { ... }` instead of `while true { ... }` to stay warning-free under `#![deny(warnings)]` (`while_true`).
  - Stub trait methods that `todo!()` must use `_` argument patterns to avoid `unused_variables` under `#![deny(warnings)]`.
  - Enum-match gotcha: avoid emitting wildcard `unreachable!()` arms when the match is already exhaustive (Rust warns with `unreachable_patterns`).
  - Return-lowering gotcha: never emit `return <expr>` when `<expr>` is statically diverging (`todo!()`, `panic!()`, `hxrt::exception::throw(...)`).
    Emit the diverging expression directly; `return <diverging expr>` triggers Rust `unreachable expression` warnings.
  - Dynamic-runtime gotcha: prefer typed `std/hxrt/*` extern wrappers over raw `untyped __rust__` for runtime APIs returning `Dynamic`
    (example: `haxe.Json.parse`, `sys.thread.Thread.readMessage`) to avoid unresolved monomorph warnings.
  - Unresolved-monomorph fallback policy:
    - User/project code now **errors by default** on unresolved monomorphs (avoid silent runtime-dynamic degradation).
    - Framework/upstream stdlib internals may still fall back to `Dynamic` as a compatibility bridge.
    - Escape hatch: `-D rust_allow_unresolved_monomorph_dynamic`.
    - Std warning audit switch remains: `-D rust_warn_unresolved_monomorph_std`.
  - Unmapped `@:coreType` fallback policy mirrors unresolved monomorphs:
    - User/project code errors by default; framework/upstream std may fallback to `Dynamic`.
    - Escape hatch: `-D rust_allow_unmapped_coretype_dynamic`.
    - Std warning audit switch: `-D rust_warn_unmapped_coretype_std`.
  - Contract diagnostic anchoring gotcha: profile-policy warnings/errors must resolve to **user project source positions**
    whenever possible. Do not anchor contract diagnostics to upstream/framework std module files just because the diagnostic
    message mentions those module names.
  - JSON boundary gotcha: do not `cast Json.parse(...)` directly to a typed anonymous structure in app/runtime code. The Rust runtime may return a `DynObject` representation that fails anon downcasts; decode through `Reflect.field` + typed validators at the boundary, then stay strongly typed.
  - Semantic-diff oracle gotcha: `haxe --interp` is not a valid oracle for threaded `sys.thread.EventLoop` / `haxe.EntryPoint` / `haxe.MainLoop` behavior on this target. Use Rust-target snapshot/example smoke for those contracts and downgrade docs accordingly instead of forcing a false semantic-diff parity claim.
- The generated crate normally includes the bundled runtime crate at `./hxrt` and adds `hxrt = { path = "./hxrt" }` to `Cargo.toml`.
  The exception is proven `-D rust_no_hxrt` output, which must omit the bundled runtime and pass the no-runtime guard.
- For class instance semantics, the runtime uses a thread-safe heap (`HxRef<T> = Arc<HxCell<T>>` with `RwLock` interior mutability):
  - concrete calls use `Class::method(&obj, ...)` where methods take `&HxCell<Class>`
  - polymorphic base/interface calls use trait objects (`HxDynRef<dyn ...>`) and `obj.method(...)` dispatch
- For field assignment on `HxRef` (`obj.field = rhs`), evaluate `rhs` first, then take `borrow_mut()` (otherwise `RefCell` will panic at runtime when `rhs` reads other fields).
- For void Haxe functions, don’t emit a tail expression just because the last expression has a non-void type (e.g. `OpAssign` is typed as the RHS); pass the expected return type into block compilation to decide whether a tail is allowed.
- Escape hatch policy: **apps/examples should not use `__rust__` directly**. Put injections behind Haxe APIs in `std/` and keep examples “pure”.
  - Repo enforcement: `-D reflaxe_rust_strict_examples` (used by `examples/**` and `test/snapshot/**`).
  - Opt-in user enforcement: `-D reflaxe_rust_strict`.
  - Narrow exception: `@:rustAllowRaw` can authorize a single low-level abstraction module under strict boundary enforcement, but it must stay small, documented, and never be used to bypass `metal` / `@:haxeMetal` raw-fallback restrictions.
  - `rust.metal.Code.expr/stmt` is a scoped raw bridge, not a normal app-facing DSL. Project-local direct use must be in an owning class tagged `@:rustAllowRaw`; framework/compiler-owned use is allowed via resolved framework roots. This still emits raw `ERaw`, so metal-clean and `@:haxeMetal` policy can reject it unless fallback is explicitly enabled for the fixture.
  - `@:rustImpl(..., "fn ...")` body strings are a narrow trait-impl metadata escape for local generated types, not the long-term app authoring model for common Rust trait patterns. Prefer Haxe interfaces, `@:rustGeneric`, typed extern islands, or future typed trait metadata when the Rust shape is common and inspectable.
- `__rust__` can be called without a prefix as `untyped __rust__("...")` (like Elixir’s `untyped __elixir__`). `reflaxe.rust.macros.RustInjection.__rust__` is an optional macro shim that:
  - keeps a typed callable surface (no `untyped` at callsites)
  - supports Reflaxe `{0}` placeholder interpolation with varargs (`RustInjection.__rust__("foo({0})", arg0)`)
- Reflaxe injection gotcha: `TargetCodeInjection.checkTargetCodeInjectionGeneric` returns an empty list when the injected string has no `{0}` placeholders. The compiler must treat that case as “literal injection string”.
- `rust.Ref<T>` / `rust.MutRef<T>` use `@:from` (typically lowered to `cast`) so Haxe typing can pass `T` where refs are expected; codegen must still emit `&` / `&mut` even when the typed expression becomes `TCast(...)`.
- Rust naming collisions across inheritance must preserve base-field names: assign names in base→derived order and only disambiguate derived names against already-used base names.
- Inheritance method dispatch model: Rust does not “inherit” methods, so subclasses must synthesize concrete Rust methods for non-overridden base methods (compile the base body with `this` dispatch bound to the subclass). This avoids invalid calls like `Base::method(&RefCell<Sub>)` and eliminates `todo!()` stubs in base trait impls.
- Base traits include inherited methods: if `BTrait` includes inherited `A.foo`, then `impl BTrait for RefCell<C>` must implement `foo` even if `B` didn’t declare it; emit base-trait impl methods from the base trait surface (declared + inherited), not just `baseType.fields.get()`.
- `super.method(...)` compiles via per-base “super thunk” methods on the current class (`__hx_super_<base_mod>_<method>`), so base implementations can run with a `&RefCell<Current>` receiver.
- Self-arg naming: treat `TSuper` as “uses receiver” so functions that call `super.*` don’t emit `_self_` but still reference `self_`.
- Accessor naming for backing fields: when a field name starts with `_` (e.g. `_x`), avoid Rust `non_snake_case` warnings and collisions by mapping accessor suffixes to `u<count>_<name>` (e.g. `_x` → `u1_x`), rather than stripping underscores.
- Exceptions/try-catch: implemented via `hxrt::exception` using a panic-id + thread-local payload.
  - `throw v` → `hxrt::exception::throw(hxrt::dynamic::from(v))`
  - `try { a } catch(e:T) { b }` → `match hxrt::exception::catch_unwind(|| { a }) { Ok(v) => v, Err(ex) => ...downcast chain... }`
  - Dynamic-throw gotcha: if the thrown expression is already `Dynamic`, do **not** box it again with `hxrt::dynamic::from(...)`.
    Double-boxing turns a `Dynamic` payload into `Dynamic<Dynamic>` and breaks catch-path reflection/field access.
  - Nested catch-unwind gotcha: panic-output suppression in `hxrt::exception` must be depth-counted (not boolean).
    Inner `catch_unwind` frames can otherwise re-enable panic-hook output too early and leak noisy `Box<dyn Any>` lines
    even when throws are correctly caught by an outer frame (observed with socket `readLine` + server/client wrappers).
  - Current limitation: catch type matching is Rust `Any` downcast (exact Rust type), so catching a subclass from a base-typed trait object isn’t supported yet.
- To include external crates and hand-written Rust modules for demos/interop, use `-D rust_cargo_deps_file=...` + `-D rust_extra_src=...` (the compiler copies `*.rs` into `out/src/` and emits `mod <file>;` in `main.rs`).
- Prefer framework-driven metadata over `.hxml` wiring when possible:
  - `@:rustCargo(...)` declares Cargo deps from Haxe types.
  - `@:rustExtraSrc("path/to/file.rs")` / `@:rustExtraSrcDir("path/to/dir")` lets framework code ship Rust modules without requiring apps to set `-D rust_extra_src=...`.
  - For std overrides that need complex backend-specific setup (for example DB driver connection builders),
    prefer moving Rust-heavy constructors into typed extern modules (`std/hxrt/**` + `@:rustExtraSrc`) rather than inline `untyped __rust__` in Haxe methods.
- Rust module names must avoid keywords (e.g. class `Impl` becomes module `impl_`).
- Nested module output migration: `-D rust_nested_modules` emits package-shaped Rust source paths and nested `mod` declarations, while preserving root flat alias modules for existing generated `crate::<flat_module>::...` references.
  Treat those aliases as a compatibility bridge, not the final idiomatic shape; future path lowering should move generated references to canonical nested `crate::foo::bar::baz::Type` paths with focused snapshots.
  - Rust module topology gotcha: a package segment can also be a generated file-backed module (`sys.Sys` plus `sys.io.Stdout`, or `demo.Domain` plus `demo.domain.Widget`). In that case, the parent must be declared as `pub mod sys;`/`pub mod demo;`, and the generated `sys.rs`/`demo.rs` file must declare its child modules. Do not inline a file-backed parent module in `main.rs`; Rust will ignore the sibling file and generated paths such as `crate::sys::Sys` will fail.
- Rust keyword escaping must include reserved keywords like `box` (Rust 2021); keep `RustNaming.KEYWORDS` / extra-src keyword checks in sync.
- Generics: Rust rejects unused type params on structs; emit a `PhantomData` field (e.g. `__hx_phantom`) when a class has type params not referenced by any instance fields.
- Constructors: lift leading `this.field = <arg>` assignments into the struct literal to avoid requiring `T: Default` for generic fields (and to reduce borrow-mut noise).
- Haxe desugaring/inlining introduces `_g*` temporaries; for `Array<T>` (a shared `hxrt::array::Array<T>` handle backed by Rust `Vec<T>` storage), avoid accidental moves by cloning `_g* = <local array>` initializers/assignments.
- Use `Context.getAllModuleTypes()` (not `Context.getTypes()`) to enumerate generated module types for dependency closure / RTTI maps.
- Stdlib emission model (important for “full stdlib parity” work):
  - Parity scope rule: “100% stdlib parity” refers to upstream cross-target std APIs (`Std`, `haxe.*`, `sys.*`, etc.).
    Target-specific namespaces (`cpp.*`, `js.*`, `lua.*`, `php.*`, `python.*`, `hl.*`, `neko.*`, and backend-native `rust.*`) are out of parity scope.
  - The compiler only emits Rust modules for **user project files** and this repo’s `std/` overrides (`isFrameworkStdFile`).
  - Upstream Haxe std files (the default `.../haxe/versions/<ver>/std/`) are *typed* but **not emitted** by default.
  - Consequence: any std API type that appears in emitted signatures (e.g. `sys.io.FileSeek`) must exist under `std/`
    (or the emission filter must be expanded intentionally).
  - File suffix policy: upstream-colliding overrides under `std/` should use `.cross.hx` so they are selected only for cross/custom-target
    compilation, avoiding accidental pickup in eval/macro/non-target contexts.
  - Packaging gotcha: release packaging flattens `reflaxe.stdPaths` into `classPath` (`src/**`), so framework-stdlib detection must support both
    local layout (`std/**`) and packaged layout (`src/haxe/**`, `src/sys/**`, top-level std modules).
  - Path-alias gotcha: framework std detection must canonicalize absolute paths (`FileSystem.fullPath`) before prefix checks, otherwise
    symlink aliases (for example `/var/...` vs `/private/var/...`) can make packaged std overrides look like non-framework files and skip emission.
  - Validation gotcha: `.cross.hx` std override behavior must be validated through a real `-lib reflaxe.rust` install path (`haxelib newrepo` + `haxelib install <zip>`).
    A raw `-cp <pkg>/src` compile is not an equivalent packaging test and can resolve upstream std modules instead.
  - Governance rule: keep `docs/stdlib-provenance-ledger.json` in sync with tracked `std/**/*.cross.hx` files, keep
    `docs/portable-stdlib-allowlist.json` aligned with `test/upstream_std_modules.txt`, and run boundary guards:
    `npm run guard:upstream-stdlib-boundary` + `npm run guard:stdlib-ledger` + `npm run guard:portable-stdlib-allowlist`.
    - Preferred update flow for Tier1 list changes: edit `test/upstream_std_modules.txt`, run
      `npm run stdlib:sync:tier2`, then `npm run stdlib:sync:allowlist`, then run stdlib guards.
- `Std.isOfType` is implemented as a compiler intrinsic (exact-type check via `__hx_type_id`, plus compile-time subtype short-circuit).
- String move semantics: many generated Rust functions take `String` by value; to preserve Haxe’s “strings are re-usable after calls” behavior, callsites currently clone String arguments based on the callee’s parameter types.
- Nullable-string gotcha: portable now defaults to nullable string mode (`hxrt::string::HxString`) while metal defaults to non-null Rust `String` unless `-D rust_string_nullable` is explicitly enabled.
  Treat cross-mode string work as compatibility-sensitive: map key types, `toString` trait bridges, hardcoded `String` paths, and runtime/native API signatures must be checked in both contracts.
  - Concrete breakage pattern: generated code can expect `HxString` while runtime/native APIs still take raw `String`
    (for example `hxrt::array::Array::join`, `sys.io.*.writeString/readLine`, `std::process::Command` args), producing large `E0308` type-mismatch cascades.
  - Interop guardrail: runtime APIs that conceptually accept string separators/paths/labels should prefer flexible signatures (`AsRef<str>`/`&str`) so both `String` and `hxrt::string::HxString` work without callsite churn.
    - Current concrete fix: `hxrt::array::Array::join` is generic over `AsRef<str>` and `HxString` implements `AsRef<str>`.
- Dynamic args: when calling a function expecting `Dynamic` (e.g. `Sys.println(v:Dynamic)`), the compiler boxes non-`Dynamic` args via `hxrt::dynamic::from(...)` and clones non-`Copy` inputs to avoid Rust moves.
- Nullable locals: when a `Null<T>` local is initialized to `null` and the **very next statement** assigns it, codegen elides the initial `None` to avoid Rust `unused_assignments` / `unused_mut` warnings (see `test/snapshot/null_optional_args`).
- Extern bindings: for `extern class` types, `@:native("some::rust::path")` maps the class to a Rust path, and `@:native("fn_name")` maps fields/methods.
  - Gotcha: Haxe may rewrite names and store the original in `:realPath`; for extern fields, prefer the post-metadata identifier (`cf.name`) unless `@:native(...)` overrides it.
- `haxe.io.Bytes` override is `extern` to prevent stdlib inlining; keep its Rust mapping (`HxRef<hxrt::bytes::Bytes>`) as a special-case that must win over generic extern-path mapping.
- Properties vs storage:
  - Only **physical** vars are emitted as Rust struct fields. Non-storage properties (`get/set`, `get/never`, etc.) are lowered to accessor calls.
  - Property assignments must return the setter return value (Haxe semantics), not necessarily the raw RHS.
  - Storage-backed accessors (`default,get` / `default,set`) commonly use `return x = v;` in Haxe; codegen must treat `x` inside `get_x`/`set_x` as direct backing-field access to avoid recursive calls.
  - In inherited method shims, the typed AST may type `this` as the base class; for property/field lowering, treat `this` as `currentClassType` (the concrete class being compiled) to avoid calling base methods with `&RefCell<Sub>` receivers.
- Profiles:
  - Default is portable output.
  - Supported selector values are `-D reflaxe_rust_profile=portable|metal` (no aliases).
  - Profile names are semantic contracts, not output-quality labels:
    - `portable` means Haxe-portable semantics first. Treat it as the default product path, not a slow/safe lane.
    - `metal` means explicit Rust-native authoring semantics, stricter boundaries, and optional reduced/no-HXRT runtime.
    - `idiomatic` is **not** a profile selector. Treat idiomatic Rust output as a quality goal for every profile.
      Portable output should be idiomatic when Haxe semantics permit; metal output should be idiomatic while honoring its Rust-first contract.
  - Architecture slogan: portable by default, Rust-native by opt-in, metal-like performance whenever the compiler can prove Haxe semantics are preserved.
    The optimizer/planner may lower portable abstractions into native Rust representations, but must not silently change the source contract or hide metal fallback where a user explicitly selected `metal`.
    Runtime/tool consumers may choose `metal` first when they need Rust-native behavior, strict host boundaries, or production performance now.
    Treat those cases as pressure to improve generic portable-to-metal convergence where semantics allow, not as permission for project-specific compiler shortcuts.
  - Portable native-import policy: importing native target modules from portable app code emits warnings by default and is recorded in `contract_report.*`.
    `nativeImportHits` preserves the source-text import diagnostic signal; `nativeImportHitsTyped` records user-source typed module usage so aliases and fully-qualified target-native references are visible in deterministic reports.
    Use `-D rust_portable_native_import_strict` to escalate those warnings to errors.
  - Metal policy: `reflaxe_rust_profile=metal` auto-enables strict app-boundary mode (`reflaxe_rust_strict`) so raw app-side `__rust__` is rejected by default.
    Typed framework facades in `src/reflaxe/rust/macros` and `std/rust/metal` remain allowed.
  - Metal string contract: in default non-null string mode, `String` cannot be assigned `null`.
    Use `Null<String>` for nullable values; explicit `== null` / `!= null` checks on strict non-null `String` lower to constant `false` / `true`.
  - Minimal-runtime policy: today, `-D rust_no_hxrt` is metal-only and must remain a hard contract.
    In that mode, do not rely on Cargo-link failures as enforcement; run source/typed-AST no-hxrt eligibility first so Dynamic/reflection/anonymous-runtime/platform blockers fail with stable `runtimeRequirements` reason kinds, then keep the emitted-code no-runtime guard pass (`NoHxrtPass`) active so remaining generated `hxrt` references fail with actionable module-level diagnostics.
    Future capability-driven portable no-hxrt support requires positive portable-facade eligibility fixtures before this policy can be widened.
  - Metal diagnostics gotcha: aggregate `ERaw` fallback diagnostics once per compile (with top modules) instead of warning per transformed module; this keeps fallback signals actionable in large std-heavy builds.
  - Optional formatter hook: `-D rustfmt` runs `cargo fmt --manifest-path <out>/Cargo.toml` after output generation (best-effort, warns on failure).
- TUI testing: prefer ratatui `TestBackend` via `TuiDemo.renderToString(...)` and assert in `cargo test` (see `docs/tui.md` and `examples/tui_todo/native/tui_tests.rs`).
  - Non-TTY gotcha: `TuiDemo.enter()` must never `unwrap()` terminal initialization. If interactive init fails (or stdin/stdout aren’t TTY), it must fall back to headless so `cargo run` in CI doesn’t panic.
  - Rust test harness gotcha: when using a shared `Mutex` in tests, recover poisoned locks with `lock().unwrap_or_else(|e| e.into_inner())` so one failing assertion does not cascade into unrelated `PoisonError` failures.
  - Path privacy gotcha: cleanup/util scripts should log repository-relative paths (not machine-absolute paths) to avoid leaking local filesystem details in terminal/CI logs.
  - Harness linkage gotcha: keep `Harness.__link()` reachable in all compile variants (not only `tui_headless`) so Rust tests that call `crate::harness::*` compile in both dev and CI outputs.
- `@:coreApi` gotcha: core types must match upstream public API exactly. Any extra helpers must be private.
  - Use `@:allow(...)`/`@:access(...)` to make private helpers usable by sibling std types.
  - Backend rule: private members in an `@:allow/@:access` class are emitted as `pub(crate)` in Rust so cross-module calls compile.
- Threading (sys.thread): implemented with a thread-safe heap (`HxRef<T>` is `Arc<...>` + locking) so Haxe values can cross OS threads safely.
  - `sys.thread.Thread` + core primitives exist; `sys.thread.EventLoop` is runtime-backed. See `docs/threading.md`.

## Testing + CI

- CI health is a hard prerequisite for downstream consumer work such as the codex-hxrust sibling checkout. If CI is reported or observed failing, stop downstream feature work, inspect the failing run, fix the compiler/runtime/tests here first, commit and push the fix, and verify CI is passing or record an explicit equivalent green validation before resuming downstream work.
- Run snapshots locally: `bash test/run-snapshots.sh`
- Run upstream stdlib sweep locally:
  - Tier1 (default): `bash test/run-upstream-stdlib-sweep.sh` (or single-module: `--module haxe.Json`)
  - Tier2 (broader): `bash test/run-upstream-stdlib-sweep.sh --tier tier2`
- Run stdlib boundary/provenance guards locally:
  - `npm run stdlib:audit:candidates`
  - `npm run stdlib:sync:tier2`
  - `npm run stdlib:sync:allowlist`
  - `npm run guard:upstream-stdlib-boundary`
  - `npm run guard:stdlib-ledger`
  - `npm run guard:portable-stdlib-allowlist`
  - `npm run guard:stdlib-candidates`
  - `npm run guard:stdlib-candidate-gap` (defaults to strict zero-gap; override only intentionally via `PORTABLE_STDLIB_CANDIDATE_GAP_MAX`)
  - `guard:stdlib-ledger` also enforces that every provenance-ledger importable module is represented in Tier2; intentional non-importable boundary modules must carry `tier2SweepExcludeReason` in `docs/stdlib-provenance-ledger.json`.
- Run Windows-safe smoke subset locally: `bash scripts/ci/windows-smoke.sh` (same subset used by the Windows CI job).
- Run packaged-install smoke locally: `bash scripts/ci/package-smoke.sh` (build zip, install into local haxelib repo, compile, cargo build).
  - Regression coverage includes a symlinked working-directory compile pass to catch path-alias mismatches when classifying framework std files.
- Run HXRT overhead benchmarks locally: `bash scripts/ci/perf-hxrt-overhead.sh`
  - Refresh baseline intentionally: `bash scripts/ci/perf-hxrt-overhead.sh --update-baseline`
  - Perf harness gotcha: metal benchmark cases use `-D rust_metal_allow_fallback` by design so trend tracking remains available while metal-clean lowering is still in progress.
    Keep the dedicated `hot_loop_no_hxrt` case strict (`-D rust_no_hxrt` without fallback) as the no-runtime parity signal.
- Run metal fallback-count guard locally: `bash scripts/ci/check-metal-fallback-counts.sh`
  - Refresh fallback baseline intentionally: `bash scripts/ci/check-metal-fallback-counts.sh --update-baseline`
  - Metal policy timing: `scripts/ci/check-metal-policy.sh` prints per-case timings and a summary.
    If this stage is slow, inspect repeated optional-fallback checks first; prefer consolidating multiple forbidden-regex assertions for the same fixture/HXML before adding parallelism.
- Update a snapshot’s golden output (after review): `bash test/run-snapshots.sh --case <name> --update`
- Run the full CI-style harness locally (snapshots + all examples): `npm run test:all` (alias for `bash scripts/ci/harness.sh`)
  - Change-gate rule: for any non-trivial compiler/runtime/std/example code change, run the full harness (`npm run check:harness`)
    before marking work complete (unless explicitly scoped to docs-only or user-approved partial validation).
  - Convenience command: `npm run hooks:check:full` runs lint/docs guards plus the full harness.
  - Harness cleanup policy: by default, `scripts/ci/harness.sh` and `scripts/ci/windows-smoke.sh` clean generated `out*` folders and `.cache/*target*` on exit.
    - Keep artifacts intentionally for debugging with `KEEP_ARTIFACTS=1`.
    - Manual cleanup: `npm run clean:artifacts` (outputs only) and `npm run clean:artifacts:all` (outputs + caches).
  - Harness snapshot parallelism: `scripts/ci/harness.sh` runs snapshot cases in bounded parallel batches by default (`HARNESS_SNAPSHOT_JOBS=4`).
    Use `HARNESS_SNAPSHOT_JOBS=1` to force the old serial path; direct `test/run-snapshots.sh` runs remain serial for focused debugging.
    GitHub CI intentionally overrides this to `HARNESS_SNAPSHOT_JOBS=6`; keep the script default more conservative for local machines.
  - Harness package-smoke skip: GitHub CI runs `scripts/ci/package-smoke.sh` as a dedicated step before the full harness, then sets
    `HARNESS_SKIP_PACKAGE_SMOKE=1` for `scripts/ci/harness.sh` to avoid the duplicate package-smoke stage.
    Do not set this flag locally unless package smoke already ran in the same validation flow.
  - Harness stage selector: `HARNESS_STAGES` accepts `all` (default) or comma/space-separated groups:
    `snapshots`, `conformance`, `policy`, `packaging`, `examples`, `parity`.
    Unknown stage names fail fast; keep local `npm run test:all` on the default full suite unless intentionally validating a focused CI shard.
  - CI harness split: GitHub Actions runs harness shards in parallel and keeps `Snapshots + Examples` as the aggregate gate.
    If adding/removing a harness shard, update both the shard job and the aggregate `needs`/result check so a missing shard cannot silently pass.
  - Example CI reuse: `scripts/ci/harness.sh` may reuse a previously compiled developer/example HXML for a CI run variant only when the
    normalized HXML contents match exactly after removing `-D rust_output=...`.
    Keep CI-specific semantic flags (`*_headless`, explicit profiles, native-mode defines, etc.) distinct so those variants still compile separately.
    The harness runs snapshot clippy as a separate curated serial pass so `--case` does not accidentally clippy every snapshot.
- Install the repo pre-commit hook (gitleaks + guards + beads flush): run `bd hooks install` then `npm run hooks:install` (requires `gitleaks` installed)
- Canonical gitleaks entrypoint: use `scripts/security/run-gitleaks.sh` (`npm run security:gitleaks`, `npm run security:gitleaks:staged`).
  Keep pre-commit + CI wired to this shared script to avoid drift in flags/version behavior.
- Local-path leak policy: run `scripts/lint/local_path_guard_staged.sh` in pre-commit and `scripts/lint/local_path_guard_repo.sh`
  in repo-wide guard checks/CI to prevent machine-local paths from entering tracked files.
- Dynamic policy guard: `scripts/lint/dynamic_usage_guard.sh` is part of hooks/CI and fails on any non-allowlisted `Dynamic` mention in first-party `*.hx`/`*.cross.hx` files.
  Keep intentional compatibility/runtime boundaries in `scripts/lint/dynamic_allowlist.txt` and remove avoidable `Dynamic` elsewhere.
  - Scan model: the guard is comment-aware; comment-only/doc-text mentions are ignored so the allowlist tracks code boundaries, not prose churn.
  - Compiler boundary-literal pattern: keep the unavoidable Haxe dynamic type-name literal centralized in
    `RustCompiler.dynamicBoundaryTypeName()` and route lookups/comparisons through it to prevent scattered allowlist churn.
  - Allowlist strictness: file-scoped entries must include an inline `# FILE_SCOPE_JUSTIFICATION: ...` comment in
    `scripts/lint/dynamic_allowlist.txt`; otherwise the guard fails during parsing.
- Deprecated-define guard: `scripts/lint/deprecated_define_guard.sh` is part of hooks/CI and fails if removed selectors/defines
  (`reflaxe_rust_profile=idiomatic|rusty`, `rust_async_preview`, `rust_profile_contract_report`, `rust_hxrt_plan_report`)
  reappear outside explicit migration/negative-test allowlisted files.
  It also fails on stale naming artifacts (`idiomatic_profile`, `async_preview_retry`, `profile_contract.*`, `hxrt_plan.*`)
  to enforce hard-cutover naming.
- Runtime gotcha: snapshots embed `runtime/hxrt/**` into `test/snapshot/**/intended/hxrt/`, so any change under `runtime/hxrt/` requires `bash test/run-snapshots.sh --update` to keep goldens in sync.
- Snapshot runner gotcha: many snapshot crates share the same crate name (`hx_app`), so `test/run-snapshots.sh` must isolate `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` per case/variant
  (using a shared base cache) to avoid binary collisions and incorrect `stdout.txt` comparisons.
- `cargo hx` wrapper gotcha: when a smoke/test run compiles both the repo wrapper tool (`tools/hx`) and generated-template wrappers with a shared `CARGO_TARGET_DIR`,
  Cargo can reuse a binary compiled with the wrong `CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR` and resolve `scripts/dev/cargo-hx.sh` to the template copy.
  Keep wrapper-target dirs isolated for mixed-root/template checks (see `scripts/ci/template-smoke.sh`).
- Docs tracker gotcha: for progress-doc drift checks, compare docs before/after `npm run docs:sync:progress` (not against git HEAD) so checks work in dirty worktrees too.
- Docs tracker source-of-truth gotcha: generated tracker docs must derive readiness/baseline status from explicit milestone/gate issues,
  not from umbrella roadmap epics. Umbrella epics stay open for planning and will make generated status falsely read as `open`.
- Docs tracker guard policy: `npm run docs:check:progress` must fail on stale tracker-backed docs even when `bd` is unavailable (fallback source is `.beads/issues.jsonl`, so keep tracker status commits synced via `bd sync`).
- Disk-space gotcha: full snapshot regeneration and full harness runs can consume many GB in `test/snapshot/**/out*`, `examples/**/out*`, Cargo caches/registries, and `.cache/examples-target`.
  If you hit `No space left on device`, run `npm run clean:artifacts:all` before re-running, then regenerate snapshots.
- Prefer DRY snapshot cases: use multiple `compile.<variant>.hxml` files in the same `test/snapshot/<case>/`
  directory (and `#if <define>` shims when needed) rather than duplicating snapshot directories for each profile.
  - Convention: `compile.hxml` → `out/` + `intended/`; `compile.metal.hxml` → `out_metal/` + `intended_metal/`.
- Pre-push directive: keep `main` green by running the closest local equivalent of CI before `git push`:
  - `npm ci --ignore-scripts --no-audit --no-fund`
  - `bash test/run-snapshots.sh --clippy` (runs curated clippy checks on a small subset of snapshot crates)
  - `bash test/run-upstream-stdlib-sweep.sh` (Tier1 curated upstream std imports under `-D rust_emit_upstream_std`)
  - `bash test/run-upstream-stdlib-sweep.sh --tier tier2` (blocking CI gate for broader parity coverage)
  - `bash scripts/ci/perf-hxrt-overhead.sh` (soft-budget warnings + artifact report)
  - `cargo fmt && cargo clippy -- -D warnings`
  - Smoke-run any examples you touched (e.g. `(cd examples/tui_todo && haxe compile.hxml && (cd out && cargo run -q))`)
- CI runs:
  - `test/run-snapshots.sh` (runs `cargo fmt` + `cargo build -q` per snapshot)
  - Keep `scripts/ci/check-metal-policy.sh` regex expectations in sync with emitted contract diagnostics and wire every `test/negative/metal_*` fixture into that script so metal subset enforcement cannot silently drift.
  - `test/run-upstream-stdlib-sweep.sh` (Tier1 per-module actionable compile/fmt/check for upstream std modules)
  - `test/run-upstream-stdlib-sweep.sh --tier tier2` (blocking CI gate for broader parity coverage)
  - `guard:stdlib-candidates` (parity-gap check; weekly + main CI upload `portable-stdlib-candidates` artifact)
  - `guard:stdlib-candidate-gap` (weekly hard budget check; keep default budget at 0 unless an approved transition explicitly sets an override)
  - `scripts/ci/package-smoke.sh` validates the packaged artifact via isolated local `haxelib` install + Rust build (including symlink-cwd alias regression).
  - `scripts/ci/perf-hxrt-overhead.sh` benchmarks HXRT overhead (`hello`/`array`/`hot_loop`/`hot_loop_inproc`/`hot_loop_no_hxrt` vs pure Rust baselines + chat profile spread) and emits soft-budget warnings + artifacts.
  - `scripts/ci/template-smoke.sh` scaffolds `templates/basic` via `scripts/dev/new-project.sh` and executes the full task-HXML matrix (`compile.build`, `compile`, `compile.run`, `compile.release`, `compile.release.run`).
  - CI shell-tooling compatibility: scripts must not hard-require `rg`; always keep a `grep`/`find` fallback.
    - Fallback test knob: set `REFLAXE_NO_RG=1` to force non-`rg` paths during local validation.
  - `scripts/ci/harness.sh` runs snapshots, metal boundary policy, upstream stdlib sweep, package smoke, template smoke, then compiles all non-CI example variants (`compile*.hxml`, excluding `*.ci.hxml`) and runs every CI variant present (`compile*.ci.hxml`, fallback `compile.hxml` when no CI file exists), including `cargo test` + `cargo run`.
  - `scripts/ci/windows-smoke.sh` runs on `windows-latest` and validates a Windows-safe subset (fmt/clippy + `hello_trace`/`sys_io` snapshots + `examples/sys_file_io` + `examples/sys_net_loopback`).
  - Weekly CI evidence summary steps are `if: always()` and must tolerate missing evidence artifacts when an earlier harness stage fails before generating them.
    Avoid escaped `\n` heredocs inside shell command substitutions in workflow YAML; use a normal literal-block heredoc or script file so GitHub's generated shell is valid Bash.
    For long Cargo-heavy weekly jobs, keep Cargo network retries enabled and disable HTTP multiplexing in CI to reduce transient crates.io HTTP2 failures.

## Build (native)

- Default: compiling with `-D rust_output=...` generates Rust and runs `cargo build` (debug) best-effort.
- HXML default policy: new user-facing `compile*.hxml` files should compile+run by default via `-D rust_cargo_subcommand=run`
  (and usually `-D rust_cargo_quiet`), unless the file is explicitly CI/headless/build-only scoped.
- The generated Cargo crate emits a minimal `.gitignore` by default (opt-out: `-D rust_no_gitignore`).
- Codegen-only: add `-D rust_no_build` (alias: `-D rust_codegen_only`).
- Deny warnings (opt-in): add `-D rust_deny_warnings` to emit `#![deny(warnings)]` in the generated crate root.
- Release: add `-D rust_build_release` / `-D rust_release`.
- Optional target triple: `-D rust_target=x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` (passed to `cargo build --target ...`).
- Cargo/tooling knobs (for parity with other targets’ tool scaffolding):
  - `-D rust_cargo_subcommand=build|check|test|clippy|run` (default: `build`)
  - `-D rust_cargo_features=feat1,feat2`
  - `-D rust_cargo_no_default_features`, `-D rust_cargo_all_features`
  - `-D rust_cargo_locked`, `-D rust_cargo_offline`, `-D rust_cargo_quiet`
  - `-D rust_cargo_jobs=8`
  - `-D rust_cargo_target_dir=...` (sets `CARGO_TARGET_DIR`)

## Tooling (lix)

- This repo uses **lix** for a pinned Haxe toolchain (see `.haxerc`).
- `haxe_libraries/reflaxe.rust.hxml` is a self-referential config so `-lib reflaxe.rust` works in `test/**` and `examples/**` without `haxelib dev`.
- `test/run-snapshots.sh` prefers the project-local Haxe binary at `node_modules/.bin/haxe` when available (override with `HAXE_BIN=...`).
- Dev watcher policy: `scripts/dev/watch-haxe-rust.sh` owns a session-local Haxe compile server in watch mode (`haxe --wait` + `--connect`) for fast incremental rebuilds.
  - Keep server ownership scoped to the watcher session (avoid attaching to external long-lived servers by default).
  - `--once` intentionally compiles directly by default.
  - Disable server mode explicitly with `--no-haxe-server` or `HAXE_RUST_WATCH_NO_SERVER=1` when debugging cache-related behavior.
  - Watch-mode cargo gotcha: normalize compile phase by mode (`run/test` force `-D rust_no_build`, `build` forces `rust_cargo_subcommand=build`) so task-style `.hxml` defaults (for example `rust_cargo_subcommand=run`) do not cause duplicate cargo invocations.
- Cargo task driver: use `cargo hx ...` (alias for `scripts/dev/cargo-hx.sh`) as a project-local runner (`compile -> cargo action`) instead of proliferating task-specific `compile.*.hxml` files.
  - Convenience aliasing: `examples/.cargo/config.toml` keeps `cargo hx ...` working from inside any `examples/<name>/` directory without extra flags.
  - Template parity: generated projects from `scripts/dev/new-project.sh` must include a local `cargo hx` alias/driver too (`templates/basic/.cargo/config.toml` + `templates/basic/scripts/dev/cargo-hx.sh`).

## Releases

- GitHub Actions:
  - `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs on PRs/pushes to `main`.
  - `.github/workflows/release.yml` runs **semantic-release** after CI succeeds on `main` (semver tag + CHANGELOG + GitHub Release + zip asset).
  - `.github/workflows/rustsec.yml` runs `cargo audit` on a schedule.
  - Workspace gotcha: exclude `examples/` + `test/` + `.cache/` from the root workspace so `cargo fmt/build` works inside generated `*/out/` crates during snapshot and template-smoke runs.
- Packaging policy: `scripts/release/package-haxelib.sh` mirrors Reflaxe build flow by merging `reflaxe.stdPaths` into `classPath` and sanitizing `haxelib.json` (remove `reflaxe` field), while still shipping target-required `runtime/` + `vendor/`.
- Conventional commits are required on `main` so semantic-release can compute the next version.
  - Use `feat:` for minor, `fix:` for patch, and `feat!:` / `BREAKING CHANGE:` for major.
- Version strings are kept in sync by `scripts/release/sync-versions.js` (used by semantic-release).
