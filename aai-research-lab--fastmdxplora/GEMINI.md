# The FastMDXplora Agent

The FastMDXplora Agent is the natural-language interface. You describe a study
in a sentence; it writes a [FastMDXplora Config](config.md).

```bash
fastmdx agent "simulate trypsin with benzamidine bound at pH 6.5 for 100 ns"
```

```yaml
systems:
  - system: 3PTB
setup:
  ph: 6.5
  forcefield: amber-openff
  ligand_name: BEN
simulation:
  duration_ns: 100
agent: assisted
agent_model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6
```

That Config then runs like any other:

```bash
fastmdx explore --config study.yml
```

The Agent stands where a human stands. It is a fourth way of producing a
Config, alongside the [GUI](gui.md), the [CLI](cli.md) and the
[API](api.md) — and it is reachable **through all three of them**.

---

## The Agent has no privileges

This is the load-bearing claim, so it is worth stating plainly.

**A Config the Agent writes goes through exactly the same validator, by the
same code, as a Config you type by hand.** There is no separate path, no
relaxed mode, no special case. `fastmdxplora.agent` imports the core; the core
imports nothing from the Agent, and a test asserts the direction.

```python
# fastmdxplora/agent/propose.py
from fastmdxplora.config.loader import ConfigError, validate_config
...
try:
    validate_config(config)
except ConfigError as exc:
    ...
```

Three consequences:

- **A proposal that did not validate carries no Config at all** — not the last
  thing that nearly worked with a caveat attached. There is no partially-valid
  result and no best-effort fallback.
- **The Agent cannot name a setting that does not exist**, because the schema
  description it writes from is generated from the same declaration the
  validator checks against.
- **Removing the Agent changes nothing about what a valid study is.** A caller
  bypassing it and calling `validate_config` directly is refused in the same
  way, by the same code, with the same message.

The one thing an Agent-written study carries that a hand-written one does not
is the `agent:` setting, which is **provenance, not permission**. Including
`agent: unvalidated` — see below — the Config itself is still validated.

---

## Connecting a model

Nothing in FastMDXplora needs a model. The Agent does, and it asks once.

```
$ fastmdx agent set
  Model:
    [1] Anthropic
    [2] OpenAI
    [3] Other (any OpenAI-compatible URL)
  > 1
  Model [claude-sonnet-4-6]:
  API key (leave blank to read ANTHROPIC_API_KEY from the environment instead):
  > sk-ant-...

  ✓ Saved to ~/.config/fastmdxplora/model.json
  ✓ Key stored there, readable only by you. It is never written into a study.
```

| Provider | Default model | Environment variable |
|---|---|---|
| `anthropic` | `claude-sonnet-4-6` | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` |
| `openai` | `gpt-5` | `OPENAI_API_KEY` |
| `compatible` | whatever you name | `FASTMDX_MODEL_API_KEY` |

Option 3 covers DeepSeek, vLLM, Ollama, OpenRouter and most local servers,
because they speak the OpenAI chat shape. One entry rather than one per vendor:
a list of vendors goes stale and a protocol does not. It takes a base URL —
`https://api.deepseek.com`, `http://localhost:11434/v1`,
`http://localhost:8000/v1`.

**Nothing extra has to be installed.** `fastmdxplora.agent` ships with the
package; `pip install "fastmdxplora[agent]"` installs no additional
dependencies. The Agent talks to a model over the standard library, with no
vendor client library anywhere in it.

### Where the key lives

In one file outside any study, readable only by its owner — or in the
environment, **which is checked first**. That is how a cluster job or a CI run
supplies one without anybody storing it.

| | |
|---|---|
| `$FASTMDXPLORA_CONFIG_DIR/model.json` | if that variable is set |
| `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/fastmdxplora/model.json` | otherwise, defaulting to `~/.config/` |
| `%APPDATA%\fastmdxplora\model.json` | on Windows |

Written with mode `0600`.

**The key never enters a Config, a Manifest, a log line or an error message.**
Those files get shared, pasted into issues and committed; a key in one is a key
on the internet. What is recorded is the provider and the model and nothing
else.

---

## The three modes

```bash
fastmdx agent "..." --assisted        # the default
fastmdx agent "..." --autonomous --budget-hours 40
fastmdx agent "..." --unvalidated
```

They are mutually exclusive, and each writes itself into the Config as
`agent: <mode>`. The budget writes itself in too, as `budget_hours`, a
top-level key with a floor of zero. It is read by `explore` whichever door
the Config came through: a budgeted Config runs in stages, setup first, then
a price, then the rest only if it fits. Required for `autonomous`, which runs
without being shown to anybody; optional in every other mode, and never wrong
to set on a study that will run for days.

### `assisted` — draft it and stop

The default. The Config prints, the repair attempts print with it, and `-o`
also writes it to a file. Nothing runs. You are there to read it.

```bash
fastmdx agent "simulate ubiquitin at pH 6.5 for 50 ns" -o ubiquitin.yml
fastmdx explore --config ubiquitin.yml
```

### `autonomous` — draft it and run it

Nobody is there to read it, so something else has to stop it, and that is a
budget.

```bash
fastmdx agent "simulate ubiquitin for 50 ns" --autonomous --budget-hours 40
```

**Without `--budget-hours` it refuses.** A default allowance would be a number
nobody chose deciding how much of somebody's card to spend.

The budget needs a figure, and the figure does not exist when the Agent
finishes writing. Cost scales with the *solvated* particle count, which depends
on box shape, padding and ion concentration — decisions setup makes. A protein
of 2,000 atoms is 60,000 solvated, and guessing from the residue count would be
inventing the water.

So the run goes in two parts:

```
setup                 cheap, minutes, and it settles the count
estimate              from that count, on this machine
simulation onwards    the expensive part, if it fits
```

The gate sits where the information first exists and before the cost is
incurred. Earlier it would be guessing; later there would be nothing left to
stop.

**A study of several runs is priced on all of them.** Each replica of a sweep
and each system of a campaign is prepared and counted on its own; an umbrella
study prepares the one system its windows share and is priced on every window,
each with its own equilibration, and on the pull that seeds them where it asks
for one.

**When it refuses, setup's output is kept.** It cost minutes and it is worth
having — a shorter study reuses it through `simulation.setup_from`, and the
particle count is what made the refusal possible. The message names the
estimate and the budget, because "too expensive" is usually answered by a
shorter run rather than a larger allowance, and you cannot choose without the
number.

Two other ways it stops: a setup that records no particle count, because
running on would spend an unknown amount — the one thing an unattended run must
not do; and a machine that cannot be measured, because no calibration means no
ceiling. A machine never measured is measured on the study's own prepared system
first; see
[Production runs and GPUs](production.md#knowing-how-long-before-committing-the-card).

### `unvalidated` — mark the work as unchecked

`unvalidated` is a **marking on the work**, not a bypass of the validator. It
says that a phase went outside the schema and nothing checked *the method*. The
study is still recorded, still reproducible, and still has a Config — what it
does not have is anything that checked the science.

The Config is validated exactly as in any other mode. A study asking for a
setting that does not exist is refused here too.

> **What it does today.** The mode is recorded in the Config, travels into the
> run's records, and stamps every figure the marked phase plots. The behaviour
> it is meant to unlock — the Agent writing code of its own, outside the schema
> — is **specified and not yet built**, and `fastmdx agent --unvalidated` says
> so when you run it. So the marking works; what it currently marks is a study
> that stayed inside the schema anyway.

---

## Which phases were checked

`agent` sits at the study level and in every phase. The study level is the
answer for the whole thing; a phase sets its own where it differs.

```yaml
agent: assisted          # a model drafted the study
analysis:
  agent: unvalidated     # and the analysis went outside the schema
```

Two levels rather than one, because a single value cannot say what is true of a
real study. A simulation written by hand because the protocol matters, an
analysis explored outside the schema, a setup a model drafted — that is one
study, and flattening it to a word loses the only thing a reader needs: which
part to be suspicious of.

The consequence is concrete. A trajectory from a validated simulation is fine
even when the analysis over it was not. Marking it anyway is crying wolf, and a
mark that appears on everything stops being read.

**Set the phase-level value, not only the study-level one.** The per-phase
values are what travel into the [Manifest](manifest.md), which keeps the
departures rather than resolving them away:

```json
{
  "study": "assisted",
  "phases": {"setup": "assisted", "analysis": "unvalidated"},
  "checked": {"setup": true, "analysis": false},
  "departures": {"analysis": "unvalidated"}
}
```

A study claiming `assisted` at the top and letting one phase go unvalidated has
made a claim it does not keep throughout. Resolving to a tidy value would hide
that; naming the departure does not.

`agent` absent everywhere means a person wrote it, so every study run before
this existed stays truthful without being rewritten.

### Which model wrote it

```yaml
agent: assisted
agent_model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929
```

`agent: assisted` says a model was involved, not which one, and six months on
that is the difference between a record and a note. "Why did this study pick
300 K" has a different answer depending on whether a frontier model or a 7B on
a laptop proposed it.

**An alias is not a version.** `claude-sonnet-4-6` names different software at
different times, because it moves when a new snapshot lands. Pin the dated
string where the record needs to identify what ran.

---

## How it gets to a valid Config

One sentence in, up to a few attempts, one Config out.

```
    request ──▶ prompt (instructions + generated schema) ──▶ model
                                                              │
                          ┌───────────────────────────────────┘
                          ▼
                    validate_config
                          │
        ┌─────────────────┼──────────────────┐
        ▼                 ▼                  ▼
     accepted        structural          anything else
        │             refusal              refusal
        ▼                 │                  │
     Config          repair prompt         stop
                          └──▶ back to the model
```

**Structural refusals are retried; semantic ones are not.** A Config that does
not match the schema is answerable by reading it. A system that does not
determine its own protonation is not, and a model that retries it is guessing
at the question the software declined to guess at. The loop stops and returns
the refusal.

**The repair prompt withholds.** It names the offending setting and, where the
refusal registry permits, the legal set. It volunteers nothing further. A
validator that hands over the fix turns every rejection into a well-specified
task — and the rule the whole design turns on is that *the validator may say
what the schema permits, and may never say what the chemistry requires*.

**Cycles are counted and capped.** Three attempts in all, the first included,
from the command line (`--attempts`), the browser and Python alike. Cheap
validation invites thrashing, and a Config that validates on the fortieth
mutation validates for reasons nobody chose. Exhausting the cap is a refusal, not a
fall-through to whatever last nearly worked.

`--phases` chooses which parts of the Config it writes; the default is
`setup,simulation`.

```bash
fastmdx agent "..." --phases setup,simulation,analysis --attempts 5
```

---

## The three channels

### From the CLI

```bash
fastmdx agent set                              # choose a model, once
fastmdx agent "simulate 1UBQ for 50 ns"        # a sentence
fastmdx agent -f request.txt -o study.yml      # from a file, written to a file
fastmdx agent "..." --autonomous --budget-hours 12
fastmdx agent                                  # no request: opens the GUI panel
```

Every flag is in [The FastMDXplora CLI](cli.md#agent).

### From the GUI

```bash
fastmdx gui        # the workbench, with an Agent section in the sidebar
fastmdx agent      # the same server, opened at that section
```

One browser and one codebase. `fastmdx agent` with no request passes `#agent`
in the URL fragment, which the page reads on load to decide where to start. Two
commands that started two servers would be two things to learn for one thing to
use.

**Conversations belong to studies.** A conversation belongs to the study
it is about, and sees that study's context. It lives inside the study
folder, at `<study>/agent/conversations/`, so copying a
study carries the conversations that made it — the record stays with the
data. A conversation about no study lives at the workspace level. Under the
composer, at the right: the mode, which
opens the Agent's settings; *Conversations*, a list grouped by study with
the loaded one first, where opening a conversation from another study loads
that study; and *New*, which starts a fresh thread and keeps the last. Every
exchange is saved as it happens; a reload shows the thread as it was. A
conversation that launches a run moves into the study it created.

The page is a conversation. What you said sits on the right; what came back
sits under it: the refusals as the Agent corrected itself, then the Config
with its actions, or an answer, or a question. Newest at the bottom, where the
composer is. Enter sends; Shift+Enter breaks a line. Every message can be
copied, edited or retried, and an edit or a retry cuts the thread from that
message on, so the conversation continues from there rather than with a fork
in it.

**The attempts are shown rather than summarised.** They are the only visible
sign that anything checked the Config, and watching a model correct itself
teaches the Config language while you wait.

**A Config is said as a plan** above its actions: the system, the force field
and water, the solvent and box, the conditions, the equilibration and
production lengths, any enhanced sampling, the analyses and the report, each
at the value the run will take, with the ones the Config leaves to their
defaults marked; and the checks the run will be held to (each observable
equilibrated, its correlation time resolved, at least ten independent
samples per mean, the temperature within 5 K of its target, the potential
energy's range per ns per atom), which the report ticks after the run and the
Agent is given ticked. It ends with what setup would build, about how many
particles in what box, and how long the study would take on this machine
where the machine has been timed, worked out as the builder works them out,
so the cost is read before the run rather than learned from setup's log.

Under a Config are the builder's own actions: *Show the config*, *Download
config*, *Copy the command*, *Download a script*, *Run here*, and a checkbox
to write every setting rather than only the ones the Agent set. They are the
builder's functions, reading the same Config, so the file, the command and the
script are exactly what the builder would produce. *Open in the builder* is a
link for changing the Config, not the way out.

A refused *Run here* says what would fix it under the button, as the
builder's refusals do: the setting to change, or the install command where a
package is missing. Where the fix is a setting of the study, **Ask the Agent
to fix it** sends the refusal into the thread as your next message and the
Agent rewrites its Config. A budget, an install and a choice only you can
make are said and not handed to the model. An `autonomous` Config that
carries its own `budget_hours` runs with it when the Settings field is empty.

The engine, the mode and the GPU-hour ceiling are in Settings, at the foot of
the sidebar. They are set once.

Nothing in the GUI layer decides whether a Config is acceptable. The validator
does that, as it does for a Config written by hand.

**The key is typed in the browser, sent once, and stored server-side.** It is
never sent back: the endpoint reports which provider and model are set and
never the secret, so a page that never receives a key cannot leak one to a
screenshot, an extension or a bug report. A browser cannot hold a secret —
anything the page keeps is readable by anything else the page runs.

Both Agent endpoints are refused off loopback, because one stores an API key
and the other spends it. See
[The FastMDXplora GUI](gui.md#who-can-reach-it).

### From Python

```python
from fastmdxplora.agent import propose_config, completion_for, load_choice

proposal = propose_config(
    "Simulate ubiquitin at pH 7.4 for 10 ns",
    complete=completion_for(load_choice()),
    phases=["setup", "simulation"],
    max_cycles=3,       # attempts in all, the first included
)

proposal.accepted   # True
proposal.cycles     # 2 — it took one repair
proposal.config     # the validated study, as a dict
proposal.refusal    # None here; the reason it stopped, otherwise
```

`complete` is the entire model interface: a callable taking a prompt string and
returning text.

```python
def my_model(prompt: str) -> str:
    ...
proposal = propose_config("…", complete=my_model)
```

No client object, no message array, no streaming — which is why swapping in a
local server, a mock, or a model this package has never heard of takes no
integration work. `proposal.config` is `None` unless validation accepted it.

Then run it like any Config:

```python
import fastmdxplora as fastmdx
fastmdx.FastMDXplora(config_data=proposal.config, output_dir="runs/study").explore()
```

---

## What the Agent sees, and what it can do

Each request goes to the model with three things beside the schema:

- **The conversation so far**, the last twelve turns each way, so a request
  that refers to one can be read.
- **The current Config**, the last one the Agent wrote. A request is a change
  to it unless it plainly describes a different study: the whole Config comes
  back with the change applied and everything else kept. "Make it 5 ns" is an
  edit, not a new study.
- **What the run is doing**: status, stage, the step and the fraction
  complete, elapsed and remaining time, the last error, the health verdict;
  the config the run used, in its short form, so "the same settings as that
  one" has something to copy from; once analyses have run, what they found,
  per analysis: the mean, its standard error and unit, the effective sample
  count, and how many frames were discarded as unequilibrated; how much longer
  the study must run for the means it withheld, and what that takes here; and
  whether the study can be continued, with the config that would continue it.
  "Is the
  RMSD converged?" is answered from those numbers, "why did it stop?" from
  the error, and "how far along?" from the step, not from a guess.
- **A file you attached.** The `+` at the left of the composer opens a
  picker on the study's own folder, or the workspace for a thread about no
  study. A chosen file goes with that message as context: text types only,
  six at most, a long log kept as its head and tail with the cut marked.
  The message records the file's name, path, size and digest, not its
  bytes. The Agent is told to cite a file when it uses it: *the setup
  manifest records `ligand_pose: auto`*, not a paraphrase.

The Agent does not open files on its own, with two exceptions: its tools read
a structure you name and a study's record (below), and nothing else. What else it needs, it is
handed; what you want it to see, you attach.

A reply is one of four things:

| | |
|---|---|
| **A Config** | YAML. Validated, repaired if refused, shown with its actions. |
| **A question** | When the request is short of something only you can supply, a structure most often. The Agent never invents one. Your next message answers it, and goes back with the request it answers. |
| **An answer** | A paragraph, when you asked something rather than asked for something. No Config, no actions. Under it, each analysis the paragraph names, with the mean the study recorded for it (its error and unit, or that the mean is not determined); choosing one opens its figure on the Analysis page. The value is the record's, whatever the paragraph says, so a number can be checked where it is read. |
| **An action** | One of: run, stop, run the fix, open viewer, open overview, open report, open builder, show config, download config; or `rerun windows` with the windows and the values you named. |

### Looking before it answers

Before it replies, the Agent may look with the software's own tools, up to
four times per reply:

| Tool | What the software tells it |
|---|---|
| `inspect_structure` | The chains, protein residues, ligands, ions and water a structure holds (a PDB identifier or a PDB or mmCIF file), the residues whose protonation state a study may set, any side chain within 3 Å of a structural metal, and what is worth knowing about it |
| `preview_setup` | What setup will build from a Config (particles, box, solute, water, ions, a padding grown for the cutoff) and how long the whole study takes on this machine, where it has been timed: what the builder says under a structure |
| `check_config` | Whether the validator accepts a Config, and if not, why and what would fix it; if so, the plan you will read, defaults marked |
| `check_selection` | How many atoms, and which residues, an MDTraj selection matches in a structure, as `fastmdx select` says |
| `read_study` | Another study's record, not the one on screen: its Config, what its analyses found, the checks it was held to, how long it ran and why, and what would fix it |

It is told to look rather than guess: to preview before stating a size or a
time, to inspect a structure before choosing its chains, ligand or a residue's
state, to check a selection before writing one into a Config, and to quote
what the software said rather than a number of its own. The tools only look:
nothing is run, written or started by one, and a look is not one of the
attempts a Config is allowed. Hosted, a tool reads inside the workspace only,
as the builder does.

What it looked at is folded under its reply, **Checked with the software**,
each tool with what was asked and what the software said, and kept with the
thread. From the command line, `fastmdx agent` prints a line for each.

### Written as it goes

The reply is shown as the model writes it, and each look as it is taken; a
config appears line by line. While it is written the send button is a stop:
pressing it ends the reply, the request to the model is closed with it, and
nothing it had written is kept. The next message goes on from yours. Both
stream shapes the providers use are read, content-block events and the OpenAI
chat shape, so a local or compatible server streams too.

### Acting

**Your instruction is the click.** "Run it" typed into the thread does what
pressing *Run here* does, through the same door, so the mode's gates apply to
a word as they do to a press: an `autonomous` run still needs its budget. The
thread says what was done. Nothing happens silently.

**It never acts unasked.** Not on a question, not on a request for a Config,
not because it thinks you would want it, and never twice in one reply. A
reply that names an action and then keeps talking is shown as prose and not
carried out.

**A run you did not plainly ask for is confirmed.** The model reads what you
attach, and a file can tell it what to say, so the prompt is not what decides.
The software reads your own message: *run it*, *start the study*, *go ahead*
and the like run at once; after anything else a `run` asks first, and only
*yes* or *run it* starts it:

```
Run the study above? Say yes.
```

**Stopping is confirmed.** A run stopped is hours gone, so `stop` asks first,
naming where the run is:

```
Stop the run at production step 16,000? Say yes.
```

Anything that is not *yes* is *Not stopped*.

**A change and a run in one message** writes the Config and says *say run
when you have read it*. One step of seeing what is about to run is what
`assisted` promises.

### Continuing a study that stopped

Say *continue it*, or *continue to 0.5 ns total*, on a study that reached
production and stopped. The Agent is handed a config that continues it:
`simulation.resume_from` naming the study, and `duration_ns` as the total
production the study should end with (or `extra_ns` for an amount more), the
same meanings the command line gives them. What is done is read from the
record: the parent's resolved config has the equilibration lengths, the
checkpoint's sidecar has the step. Stopped at whole-run step 321,000 with
100,000 of equilibration, 0.442 ns of production is done; 0.5 ns in all
leaves 0.058. The study is extended in place from its last checkpoint, with
the same prepared system and no minimisation or equilibration, which is what
makes it the same trajectory rather than a new run from a snapshot; every
segment is then joined and the analyses rerun, and the GUI watches the study
while it does. The Agent never writes `resume_from` by hand. Where a study
cannot be continued, because it has no production checkpoint or its method
deposits bias a checkpoint does not carry, it says why and offers a fresh
run.

### Why it stopped, and what fixes it

Ask why a study stopped, or what to do now, and the Agent answers from the
study's own record of what would fix it: the fix, the command or config
that runs it, and what it costs at the speed the study ran. A stopped run
is `fastmdx resume`; umbrella windows that sampled too little are run again
longer with `--rerun-window`, by the length the thinnest needs; gaps between
windows get the design their sampling implies. Where the answer is a choice
only you can make, such as a ligand's protonation, the Agent says so and
names where it is recorded, and offers no value. See
[What would fix it](refusals.md#what-would-fix-it-and-what-it-costs).

Tell it to carry the fix out (*resume it*, *rerun those windows*) and it
replies `run the fix`: the first fix that is this software's own command, a
resume or windows run again, is shown to you with its command and price, and
runs when you say yes. A fix waiting on a choice only you can make, a setting
to change or an install command is never run for you.

In an umbrella study, name the windows and what they should run with
(*rerun window 3 at 6000*, *windows 2 and 5 again for 4 ns*) and the Agent
replies `rerun windows 3 at 6000`. The software reads the windows and the
numbers from that line, checks them against the study, builds the command
from the study's own record (`--rerun-window` with `--rerun-force-constant`
or a length) and asks you, with the spring in its unit and the price at the
study's speed. Every other window is kept. The Agent uses the values you gave;
asked for a stiffer spring or a longer run without a number, it asks for one.

### Saying what "done" means before the run

Ask for a quantity to a precision (*simulate chignolin until its RMSD is
determined to 0.01 nm*), or to run until something is determined, and the Agent
writes the study's stopping rule, `simulation.stop_when`: the quantities, the
error each must reach, three replicas over the seed, and the most production
any run may reach. The plan shows it on its **Stops when** line before
anything runs, so the criterion is committed to before any data is seen,
and the code, not the model, judges it afterwards. Where you state no
precision, the Agent chooses one to answer your question; it is in the plan
for you to change. A rule the study cannot keep (no replicas, an analysis
that records no mean, a ceiling below the first piece) is refused by the
same validator that gates every proposal, so the Agent repairs it before you
see it. Asked afterwards why the study ran as long as it did, the Agent
answers from the record of each round. See
[Running until it is determined](production.md#running-until-it-is-determined).

## What the Agent will not do

- **It does not invent a structure.** A request that names none gets a
  question back. A request that names a molecule with several deposited
  structures gets the candidates and a question.
- **It does not decide chemistry the software declined to decide.** A refusal
  that needs a scientific judgement stops the loop rather than being guessed
  around.
- **It does not filter your topic.** There are no content refusals. Every
  refusal you will see from it is a schema, chemistry or environment refusal
  from the ordinary registry.
- **It does not see your key in anything it writes.**

### What is not built yet

One thing is specified and incomplete, and it is better to know than to find
out:

- **`unvalidated` is recorded and marked, not enforced.** The mode reaches the
  Config, the Manifest and every figure the marked phase plots. What it is
  meant to unlock — the Agent writing code of its own, outside the schema — is
  not built, so there is currently nothing outside the schema for it to mark.
