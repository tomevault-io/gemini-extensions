# agents-config

A shared configuration repository for AI coding agents. Defines how
`.claude/` (Claude Code) and `.opencode/` (opencode) are organized and how they reference each other.

## Primary instruction

Primary instructions: `node_modules/@daochild/agents-config/AGENTS.md` — read in full and follow unless overridden below.

Mandatory start-of-session checklist:
1. Read `node_modules/@daochild/agents-config/AGENTS.md` completely.
2. If the task involves code changes, load the matching auditor skill from AGENTS.md's Audit Rule before implementation.
3. Confirm the architecture approach with the user and document it before coding.
4. Do not begin implementation until steps 1–3 are satisfied.

## Behavior

You are committed to honesty and accuracy above all else.

Instructions:

- Prioritize accuracy over fluency.
- If you are an agent, do NOT copy files from this repository; instead, inherit them.
- Distinguish clearly between facts, estimates, assumptions, and opinions.
- If you are unsure, say what is uncertain and why.
- Do not invent citations, quotes, studies, URLs, or sources.
- When discussing recent events or rapidly changing topics, indicate that information may have changed and recommend
  verification from current sources.
- When providing statistics, identify whether they are exact figures, estimates, or approximations.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, explain the alternatives rather than assuming one is correct.

## Audit Rule

When the current task involves significant code changes — for example, after the first code-generation prompt or after
substantial deviations from the agreed Statement of Work (SOW) — the agent MUST run a system audit before finalizing the
output.

1. **Pick the right auditor skill** for the domain of the change. Examples (replace `xxx` with the actual domain):
    - Smart contracts / EVM → `senior-solidity-auditor`
    - Bitcoin / Taproot / PSBT → `senior-bitcoin-auditor`
    - Quality assurance / test strategy → `senior-qa`
    - General architecture / system design → `senior-software-architect`
2. **Run the audit via the matching `xxx-auditor` skill.** Surface findings, severity, and concrete remediation steps.
3. **If the required skill does not exist locally, create it first:**
    - Add `.opencode/skill/<xxx-auditor>/SKILL.md`
    - Mirror to `.claude/skills/<xxx-auditor>/SKILL.md` when a Claude Code counterpart is maintained
    - Register the skill path in `opencode.json` if needed
    - Then execute the audit using the newly created skill.

Do not skip the audit because a skill is missing; create the skill and perform the audit as part of the same session.

## AI-Driven SDLC Regulatory Framework

This repo ships a BMad-style, subagent-based SDLC that operationalizes the AI-Driven Software Development Lifecycle (now
fully absorbed into the `sdlc-regulatory` skill). It is **always-on** via the `sdlc-gates` rule and is the default flow
for any feature/change that touches multiple modules or is medium/high risk.

### Components

| Component             | Path (opencode)                                                                      | Claude mirror                                  | Agent Skills mirror                       |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Methodology skill     | `.opencode/skill/sdlc-regulatory/SKILL.md`                                           | `.claude/skills/sdlc-regulatory/SKILL.md`      | `.agents/skills/sdlc-regulatory/SKILL.md` |
| Always-on rule        | `.claude/rules/sdlc-gates.md` (also in `opencode.json` instructions)                 | same                                           | `.agents/rules/sdlc-gates.md`             |
| Orchestrator subagent | `.opencode/agent/sdlc-orchestrator.md`                                               | `.claude/agents/sdlc-orchestrator.md`          | `.agents/agents/sdlc-orchestrator.md`     |
| Role subagents (×9)   | `.opencode/agent/sdlc-{analyst,pm,architect,sm,dev,qa,security,reviewer,auditor}.md` | mirrored (Claude Code frontmatter, no `mode:`) | mirrored verbatim                         |
| `/sdlc` slash command | `.opencode/command/sdlc.md`                                                          | `.claude/commands/sdlc.md`                     | `.agents/commands/sdlc.md`                |

### SDLC chain

```
requirement → sdlc-analyst → sdlc-pm → sdlc-architect → sdlc-sm
           → sdlc-dev → sdlc-qa → sdlc-security → sdlc-reviewer → sdlc-auditor
           → deploy (CI/CD, subject to the Deployment Gate)
```

Each role owns one gate from the `sdlc-regulatory` skill. A failed gate returns work to the previous role with a
`BLOCKED` note; no gate is skipped. AI never self-validates its own work — reviewer/auditor/security are different
agents from dev. High-risk changes require explicit human approval at Architecture, Security, and Code Review gates. The
`sdlc-regulatory` skill also contains a compliance crosswalk (EU AI Act, NIST AI RMF, ISO/IEC 42001, SOC 2, GDPR) for
regulated projects.

### When to use

- **Full `/sdlc` flow**: any change touching multiple modules, medium/high risk, or requiring traceability/compliance
  artifacts.
- **Inline (main agent only)**: documentation, test generation, trivial internal refactoring (autonomy 80–100%). Still
  subject to the `sdlc-gates` rule.
- **Above ~50% autonomy cap**: must use the full flow with human approvals.

See the `sdlc-regulatory` skill for the full gate checklists, risk-autonomy table, traceability format, and the
compliance crosswalk. Config is loaded once at startup — restart opencode after editing `opencode.json`, agents, skills,
plugins, or commands.

## Linking

- `AGENTS.md` (root) is the single source of truth for layout and conventions. Both tools read it: Claude Code via
  `.claude/CLAUDE.md`, opencode via
  `opencode.json` → `instructions` → `AGENTS.md`.
- `.opencode/AGENTS.md` is opencode-specific instructions (loaded by
  `opencode.json`). It defers to the root `AGENTS.md` for shared structure and only adds opencode-only notes.
- `.claude/CLAUDE.md` is Claude Code's instructions file. It sources the root `AGENTS.md` so both tools see the same
  layout.
- `.agents/` is the cross-client configuration directory compatible with the
  [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/) convention. It is optional; existing
  `.claude/` and `.opencode/` directories remain authoritative for their respective clients. The `.agents/` directory is
  intended as a shared fallback so skills registered there are visible to any agent that scans the
  `.agents/skills/` convention.
- Skills live in `.opencode/skill/` (or `.opencode/skills/`), `.claude/skills/`, and `.agents/skills/`. `opencode.json`
  declares all three paths under
  `skills.paths` so opencode auto-discovers both Claude-format and Agent-Skills skills.
- The example `docs` subagent exists in both `.opencode/agent/docs.md` and
  `.claude/agents/docs.md`. Each tool uses its own copy; they share the same description so behavior is consistent.

## Adding a new component

| Component      | opencode path                         | Claude Code path              | Agent Skills path             |
|----------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Subagent       | `.opencode/agent/<n>.md`              | `.claude/agents/<n>.md`       | `.agents/agents/<n>.md`       |
| Skill          | `.opencode/skill/<n>/SKILL.md`        | `.claude/skills/<n>/SKILL.md` | `.agents/skills/<n>/SKILL.md` |
| Slash command  | `.opencode/command/<n>.md`            | `.claude/commands/<n>.md`     | `.agents/commands/<n>.md`     |
| Plugin         | `.opencode/plugin/<n>.ts`             | n/a                           | n/a                           |
| Always-on rule | add to `opencode.json` `instructions` | add to `.claude/rules/`       | add to `.agents/rules/`       |

## Code Generation Pipeline

To create an agent for code generation tasks:

1. **Define the agent** in `.opencode/agent/code-generator.md`:
   ```markdown
   ---
   description: Generates code based on specifications and requirements
   mode: primary
   model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6
   permission:
     edit: ask
     bash: ask
   ---
   
   You are a code generation agent specialized in creating high-quality code...
   ```

2. **Create supporting rules** in `.claude/rules/code-generation.md`:
    - Coding standards and patterns
    - Language-specific guidelines
    - Testing requirements

3. **Add skills** in `.opencode/skill/code-gen/SKILL.md`:
   ```markdown
   ---
   name: code-gen
   description: Use when generating new code or refactoring existing code
   ---
   
   # Code Generation Skill
   
   When generating code, follow these steps...
   ```

4. **Set up commands** in `.opencode/command/generate.md`:
   ```markdown
   ---
   description: Generate code from specifications
   ---
   
   /generate [specification] - Create code based on provided requirements
   ```

5. **Configure permissions** in `opencode.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "agent": {
       "code-generator": {
         "permission": {
           "edit": "ask",
           "bash": "ask"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

After editing `opencode.json`, an agent file, a skill, a plugin, or any other config-time file, restart opencode —
config is loaded once on startup and is not hot-reloaded.

## General Recommendations

- Create a `README.md` file with deployment instructions
- Create a `.aiignore` file to exclude files and directories from AI analysis
- Store R&D artifacts in the `docs/` directory:
    - `docs/BUSINESS_LOGIC.md` - Business requirements and logic
    - `docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Implementation plan, status, and progress
    - `docs/adr/NNNN-<slug>.md` - Architecture Decision Records

The AI-Readable Codebase contract in the `sdlc-regulatory` skill also requires root-level `ARCHITECTURE.md`,
`CONTRIBUTING.md`, and `SECURITY.md` files for any project the SDLC runs against. This repo maintains all of them.

## Architecture Approach Selection

Before implementation, always ask the user what architecture approach to use, as the choice depends on business logic
complexity. Consider these patterns:

- **Clean Architecture** - Separates business logic from frameworks and I/O, promoting testability and maintainability
- **Onion Architecture** - Layers of dependencies pointing inward toward the domain core, emphasizing domain isolation
- **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)** - Prioritizes simplicity and avoiding unnecessary complexity
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** - Reduces duplication by abstracting common functionality
- **Hexagonal/Ports and Adapters** - Decouples application core from external systems through ports and adapters
- **Microservices** - Decomposes application into loosely coupled, independently deployable services
- **Monolithic** - Single deployable unit containing all functionality, suitable for simpler applications

Choose the approach based on project scope, team size, scalability requirements, and business logic complexity. Document
the decision in an ADR under `docs/adr/` and summarize it in root `ARCHITECTURE.md`.

## Security Guidelines

- Set up a vault (e.g., Hardhat vault) on your machine or repository to securely store private keys
- Never commit sensitive information directly to the repository
- Use environment variables or secure vault solutions for all secrets
- **LLM Security Rule**: LLMs must never commit tokens, keys, personal data, or any sensitive information to code, even
  if they have permission to read such data. This prevents accidental data breaches and maintains security boundaries.

## Cross-Platform Portability

To make the project portable across Node.js, Python, and Rust infrastructures:

- **Language-Agnostic Configuration**: Store environment-specific settings in `.env` files or external configuration
  management systems
- **Containerization**: Use Docker and docker-compose to package applications and their dependencies for consistent
  deployment across platforms
- **API-First Design**: Expose functionality through REST/gRPC APIs to enable interoperability between services written
  in different languages
- **Shared Libraries**: Implement core business logic in portable formats (e.g., Protocol Buffers, JSON Schema) that can
  be consumed by all target platforms
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Use tools like Terraform or CloudFormation to define infrastructure that can deploy any of
  the language-specific services
- **Polyglot Persistence**: Design data access patterns that work across different database clients and ORMs for each
  platform

## AI Pipeline Configuration

When configuring your AI development pipeline:

1. Follow the code generation pipeline steps above
2. Add security checks as the final step of the pipeline
3. Ensure all generated code passes security scanning before deployment
4. Implement automated testing as part of the generation workflow
5. Add automated versioning updates at the end of the pipeline

## Code Quality Standards

All generated code must meet production-ready standards:

- **Production Ready Only** - All code must be production quality from the start
- **Deep Research First** - Conduct thorough research at the beginning of development
- **Document Findings** - Store research results and technical decisions
- **Time Estimates** - Provide estimates in hours and weeks for all development work
- **Comprehensive Testing** -
    - Local and development environment testing required
    - Minimum 80% code coverage
    - Include unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests
    - Automated test execution as part of the development workflow

### Documentation Checklist (End of Session)

- [ ] New files/directories documented in appropriate README or STRUCTURE.md
- [ ] Architecture decisions recorded in ADRs or ARCHITECTURE.md
- [ ] API changes reflected in documentation
- [ ] Configuration changes documented
- [ ] Testing strategy updated if new test patterns introduced
- [ ] Dependencies added/removed documented

Keep documentation synchronized with code — treat outdated docs as technical debt.
