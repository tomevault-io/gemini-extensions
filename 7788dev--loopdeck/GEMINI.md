## loopdeck

> LoopDeck is a PHP 8.1+ ThinkPHP 8 cloud-task panel (NetEase Cloud Music, Bilibili, Epic, etc. daily/level tasks). Code lives in `app/`: `index/` serves users, `admin/` provides administration, `cron/` runs scheduled work, `install/` handles first-run setup, and `service/`, `middleware/`, and `command/` hold shared behavior. Platform adapters are under `extend/`. Configuration belongs in `config/`; templates sit in each app's `view/`; browser assets and the front controller are in `public/`. Container scripts live in `docker/`, and regression checks in `tests/`.

## Project Structure & Module Organization

LoopDeck is a PHP 8.1+ ThinkPHP 8 cloud-task panel (NetEase Cloud Music, Bilibili, Epic, etc. daily/level tasks). Code lives in `app/`: `index/` serves users, `admin/` provides administration, `cron/` runs scheduled work, `install/` handles first-run setup, and `service/`, `middleware/`, and `command/` hold shared behavior. Platform adapters are under `extend/`. Configuration belongs in `config/`; templates sit in each app's `view/`; browser assets and the front controller are in `public/`. Container scripts live in `docker/`, and regression checks in `tests/`.

Do not edit generated or local-state directories such as `vendor/` and `runtime/`. Treat `public/static/uploads/` as runtime data.

## Architecture & Security Gotchas

- `extend/` is loaded via composer **classmap** (not the `app\` PSR-4 root) and adapters use their own namespaces (e.g. `namespace netease;`, `bilibili\sdk`). After adding or renaming classes there, run `composer dump-autoload`.
- Scheduling is in-process: `cron/` plus `app\service\AutomaticSchedule` execute task classes directly behind a task-name whitelist. Never reintroduce URL self-invocation that puts cookies, `RUN_KEY`, or other secrets into query strings — that pattern was deliberately removed for security ([decision](.agents/notes/implemented/architecture/2026-09-03-in-process-scheduling.md)).
- `runtime/netease-daka/` holds per-account task state files; deleting an account must remove its state file, and the scheduler prunes orphans after `DAKA_STATE_RETENTION_DAYS` (default 30).
- User-facing templates, copy, and README are Simplified Chinese; keep new UI text consistent.
- Frontend console: new platform task entries join the existing `VIP 功能` nav group in `app/index/view/console/head.html` — never create a new nav group for them ([decision](.agents/notes/rejected/architecture/2026-09-24-daily-checkin-platforms.md)).
- Cron task-log entries have a fixed shape: a `[成功]`/`[重试中]`/`[失败]` prefix derived from `Common::statusTag()` in `app/cron/controller/Common.php`, followed by user-facing detail copy composed through the `app\service\TaskMessage` templates — multi-subtask results must never hand-write whole sentences, and "将自动重试" may only appear for results that genuinely retry in minutes ([decision](.agents/notes/implemented/architecture/2026-09-25-task-message-copy-composer.md)). Route every task result through that helper instead of hand-formatting status prefixes, and map scheduler exceptions that reschedule a job to `[重试中]`.
- `daka_new` completion copy is split by entry state: a verification run that finds the settled counter at target must report the day's real totals (`本次已听歌 X 首，累计听歌总数由 Y 首变更为 Z 首`); 「今日已完成，无需重复打卡」 is reserved for runs that start after the day was already completed, and failure copy is separate ([decision](.agents/notes/implemented/architecture/2026-09-25-daka-settlement-confirmation-copy.md)).
- `DOCKER.md` covers container deployment and the updater flow; consult it before touching `docker/`, `compose.yaml`, or `app/service/SystemUpdater.php`.
- The web process never drives Docker: the admin 「立即检查」 button may only create the empty `auto-updater-state.json.check-request` marker, and the updater keeps choosing sources, images and commands itself — never add a web endpoint that updates, pulls or passes parameters to the updater ([decision](.agents/notes/implemented/architecture/2026-09-28-updater-manual-check-request.md)).
- Never report a run that accomplished nothing as success: when zero of N actions land (e.g. `已投币 0/3`), return failure with the upstream reason, and treat per-item refusals such as Bilibili 34005 (video already coined) as skip-and-continue, not end-of-run ([decision](.agents/notes/implemented/architecture/2026-09-28-bilibili-coin-skip-capped-videos.md)).

- Do not reintroduce payment gateways, online purchases, balances or pricing. Entitlements come from registration gifts, administrator settings and administrator-issued redemption codes ([decision](.agents/notes/implemented/architecture/2026-09-28-admin-managed-entitlements.md)).
- New redemption codes combine VIP days with one cross-platform account total; zero means permanent VIP / unlimited accounts. Preserve higher and unlimited benefits on renewal; user-table quota=0 still means no slots. Only legacy quota codes add slots. Serialize redemption and account creation by the same user row lock ([decision](.agents/notes/implemented/architecture/2026-09-29-combined-redemption-account-limit.md)).

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

- `composer install` installs locked PHP dependencies and refreshes autoloading.
- `php think run` starts the ThinkPHP development server (after configuring the database).
- `php tests/AutomaticScheduleTest.php` runs one offline regression test.
- `for test_file in tests/*Test.php; do php "$test_file"; done` runs the same offline suite used by the Docker build.
- `docker build -t loopdeck:local .` validates dependencies, runs tests, and builds the image. GitHub Actions only builds/publishes the image — the offline tests run here, not in a separate CI job (multi-platform build: [decision](.agents/notes/implemented/process/2026-09-24-ci-native-runner-build.md)).
- `sh docker/deploy.sh` prepares configuration and starts the app, scheduler, updater, and MySQL services; the default app port is `8001`. After initial setup, `docker compose up --wait` reuses the saved configuration.

For containers, run `sh docker/deploy.sh` to generate and persist database credentials automatically; copy `.env.example` to `.env` first only when customizing options such as an external MySQL host. Docker Compose 2.20.0+ is required. Use `config/Db.example.php` for local database configuration.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

Follow the existing PSR-12-style PHP: four-space indentation, braces on new lines, one class per file, and `declare(strict_types=1);` in new files. Match the `app\` PSR-4 namespace to the directory tree. Use PascalCase classes, camelCase methods/properties, and UPPER_SNAKE_CASE constants. Prefer typed signatures and `final` where extension is not intended. No repository-wide formatter is configured; follow adjacent code.

## Testing Guidelines

Tests are executable PHP scripts, not PHPUnit cases. Name regressions `FeatureNameTest.php`, load `vendor/autoload.php`, throw on failed assertions, and print a success line. Cover every bug fix and important branch; no percentage threshold is enforced. `LiveSmoke.php` scripts contact upstream services and run only when invoked explicitly.

The full suite also needs Node and `pdo_sqlite`: run `node tests/FrontendInteractionTest.js` after the PHP suite. Windows PHP can enable SQLite with `-d extension=pdo_sqlite`. Keep stateful regressions on the isolated in-memory fixture and exercise rendered scripts, rather than relying only on source-string assertions ([decision](.agents/notes/implemented/testing/2026-09-28-runtime-usability-regressions.md)).

Every feature removal must be pinned by "no longer reachable" assertions in `tests/FeatureRemovalTest.php`, landed in the same commit as the deletion ([decision](.agents/notes/implemented/testing/2026-09-15-feature-removal-pinned-by-test.md)).

`DockerDeploymentTest.php` executes deployment scripts against a stub Docker CLI in a temporary directory. On Windows, set `LOOPDECK_TEST_SHELL` to Git for Windows `bin/sh.exe`; Linux uses `sh` from `PATH`.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

History uses concise Conventional Commit subjects: `feat: add ...`, `fix: prevent ...`, `test: align ...`, and `docs: clarify ...`. Keep commits focused. A release is one commit: bump `VERSION` and rewrite the README `当前版本` section together — the old current-version block moves to the top of `历史更新` as a single line ([decision](.agents/notes/implemented/process/2026-09-25-release-updates-version-and-readme.md)); run releases with the [release-version workflow](.agents/skills/release-version/SKILL.md), which ends only after the GHCR image for the pushed HEAD is verified. Pull requests should explain behavior and risk, link issues, list commands run, and include screenshots for UI changes. Highlight schema, environment, Docker, or scheduler changes.

## Security & Configuration

Never commit `.env`, `config/Db.php`, credentials, tokens, logs, or generated uploads. Keep secret examples inert, and review dependency changes with `composer audit --locked`.

## Agent Notes

Durable decision records ("why" and "what was rejected") live in `.agents/notes/` — one home per fact, landed in the same commit as the code they explain. Rules above link to the note that justifies them. Format and lifecycle: [.agents/notes/README.md](.agents/notes/README.md).
