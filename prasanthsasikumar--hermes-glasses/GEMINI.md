# Hermes Glasses - notes for Claude

A standalone, MIT-licensed project. See README.md for architecture and setup.

## Current state (2026-07-10)

Voice loop and vision loop both work end-to-end on device:
live on-device transcription (SFSpeechRecognizer) → `{"type":"query"}` over
WebSocket → Python bridge → `hermes chat -q [--image] -Q` → response text +
TTS (PCM16 mono 24 kHz) back to the phone. Visual queries trigger a glasses
photo via the DAT camera API.

## Key facts that are easy to get wrong

- **STT is on-device.** The app does NOT stream mic audio to the bridge
  anymore. The bridge's audio/VAD/Google-STT path is legacy fallback only.
- **Audio session uses mode `.default`, not `.voiceChat`** - voiceChat's DSP
  gates speech to the noise floor (~20 dB down). There is therefore NO echo
  cancellation: the recognizer is suspended while Hermes speaks and resumes
  0.7 s after playback ends.
- **Never detach the TTS player node** - `AVAudioEngine.detachNode` on a live
  node raises NSException (SIGABRT). The player is attached once and reused.
- **SFSpeechRecognizer:** `task.cancel()` fires the old task's handler with an
  error. Restart cycles are guarded by a generation counter or the recognizer
  goes deaf after the first suspend/resume.
- **Glasses camera needs a separate permission** granted through the Meta AI
  app: `wearables.requestPermission(.camera)` (the Photo test button runs it).
  Streams fail with `permissionDenied` otherwise.
- **Camera streams are one-shot:** fresh `addStream()` per capture, stopped
  via `defer` on every path. Config matches Meta's CameraAccess sample
  (`.raw`, `.low`, 24 fps).
- **WebSocket frames:** binary from app = mic audio (legacy). Photos travel
  ONLY as base64 JSON. The bridge runs `websockets.serve(..., max_size=16MiB)`
  because a base64 JPEG exceeds the 1 MiB default.
- **Display HUD (Ray-Ban Display):** `HermesDisplayManager` attaches
  `addDisplay()` to the SAME DeviceSession as the camera. Every display
  call is best-effort - errors are logged, never surfaced. Settings keys:
  `display_hud_enabled` (default true), `display_silent_mode`.
- **Glasses mic and the HUD are mutually exclusive.** The glasses mic is
  Bluetooth HFP (the DAT SDK has no audio capability); an active HFP/SCO
  link makes the glasses firmware show its CALL SCREEN on the lens, which
  covers all DAT display content. iPhone mic = HUD visible; glasses mic =
  call screen. Firmware behavior - cannot be overridden from the app.
- **Headset mode is the pocket setup:** `MicSource.headset` routes HFP to
  earbuds (never to the glasses - port chosen by name heuristic in
  `HermesAudioManager.looksLikeGlasses`), so the lens keeps the HUD while
  mic + TTS live in the ears. Falls back to the iPhone mic (with a notice)
  when no non-glasses HFP device is present.
- **Device context:** every query carries a context line (time, location,
  motion, connectivity, battery, weather). Direct mode (the provider path)
  gets it as a SECOND, uncached system block (persona block stays first + cached);
  bridge mode gets it as a "[Context: …]" prefix on the query text - the
  bridges need no changes. History stores raw user text only. Keys:
  `context_enabled` / `context_precise_location` (both default true).
- **On-device intents (`IntentDetector`):** the finalized transcript is
  classified BEFORE the AI brain. "take me to X" / "I want to go to X" starts
  `NavigationController` (MapKit route + CoreLocation) and never hits the AI;
  the lens shows a Mapbox static map re-centered on the user (https images
  only, 600x600, throttled >=15 m and >=4 s). "what is X" runs the normal
  answer AND fetches a Wikipedia lead image, rendered as text + `Image` on the
  lens. Keys: `navigation_enabled`, `definition_images_enabled`; Mapbox token
  in Keychain via `MapCredentials`. All display-only + best-effort.
- **Social encounters ("remember this person"):** a whole-utterance command
  (NOT a substring - "remember" is too common) starts a capture: the glasses
  photo and the spoken note run IN PARALLEL (`encounterPhotoTask` is joined by
  `finishEncounter`, so they can land in either order). The next finalized
  utterance is claimed as the note before any other intent runs; "cancel"
  discards; 30 s of silence saves the photo with an empty note; a camera
  failure saves the note alone. Persisted by `EncounterStore` to Application
  Support (`encounters.json` + `photos/*.jpg`) - no AI, no bridge, no network.
  Reviewed in `PeopleView`. Key: `social_notes_enabled`.
- **Settings is a hub, not one scroll** (`Views/SettingsView.swift`, extracted
  out of ContentView): a glasses status card plus one row per area, detail one
  tap deeper. Text the user types (bridge endpoint, API key) is owned by the
  ROOT SettingsView and committed on Done *and* swipe-dismiss - sub-pages take
  bindings, so nothing is lost whichever page is open.
- **Lens view (Object Snap):** live glasses video via a persistent stream -
  the ONE exception to one-shot camera streams, owned by
  `HermesCameraManager.startLiveStream`/`stopLiveStream` and running only
  while `LensView` is on screen. Lens does NOT need (and must never start)
  the voice session: it connects a camera-only DeviceSession via
  `HermesSessionViewModel.ensureCameraSession()` (reuses the voice session
  when one is live) and releases it on close - opening Lens never leaves
  the mic listening. While it runs, `capturePhoto()` serves the
  latest live frame as JPEG (voice visual queries keep working; no second
  stream). Detection: bundled `yolo11n.mlpackage` (ultralytics export,
  `nms=True` - see `tools/export-yolo.md`) via `VNCoreMLRequest`;
  `ObjectDetector` converts Vision's bottom-left boxes to top-left-origin
  `Detection`s ONCE at that boundary. `DwellTracker` (pure logic, tested in
  `tests/dwell/`) fires a snap after 2 s of center-reticle coverage with
  IoU-based identity + post-snap cooldown. Snaps are session-only, in
  memory, no AI/bridge/network.
- **Conversation capture ("record this conversation"):** whole-utterance
  start/stop commands (`IntentDetector.conversationStartCommands` /
  `conversationStopCommands`; stop is checked with `isConversationStop`
  ONLY while active - during a capture EVERY utterance is claimed as
  transcript before intents/AI, nothing reaches the brain). Runs inside
  the voice session; vision side reuses the Lens machinery (live stream +
  YOLO + `DwellTracker`) filtered to `person` boxes - a 2 s look snaps a
  crop, gated by `ConversationCaptureModel` (10 s between snaps, 12 max,
  tested in `tests/conversation/`). Stop saves ONE encounter: full
  transcript as the note + every snap. `Encounter` now holds
  `photoFilenames: [String]` (decoder migrates the old single
  `photoFilename` key; `photoFilename` is a computed first-photo
  accessor). `endSession()` SAVES a running capture (silently) instead of
  discarding it - opposite of the half-finished "remember this person"
  rule. Same `social_notes_enabled` gate; UI toggle is the Record chip in
  the status row.
- **Replies with options become buttons** (`ChoiceDetector`, pure, tested in
  `tests/choices/`). "A) Sydney, B) Melbourne, …" turns into lens buttons,
  chat chips, and a line on the simulated lens; tapping one submits the
  option's WORDS, not its letter. Deliberately conservative - two or more
  markers, ascending from A/1, each with text - because a false positive
  replaces Stop/Repeat on a display the wearer can't easily escape. A reply
  carrying options never auto-dwells away.
- **Mic tap-to-switch cannot pre-filter by device.** HFP ports only appear
  in `availableInputs` once the audio category allows Bluetooth, and the
  iPhone-mic path deliberately doesn't (it stops iOS hijacking the input).
  Enumerating anyway made connected glasses report "not available", so
  `toggleMicSource` walks to the next route that actually takes and
  `setMicSource` returns whether it did.
- **The Meta AI camera grant is requested AT PAIRING**
  (`ensureGlassesCameraAfterPairing`, fired from `ContentView.onChange` of
  `registrationState`), offered again in onboarding, shown in Settings →
  Devices → Glasses camera, warned about under the eye toggle, and
  requestable from the Lens error state. It used to be requested in exactly
  one place - the Photo test button - so anyone who never pressed it hit
  "camera unavailable" in Lens and photo-less encounters, with nothing
  explaining why. Never gate a feature on this grant without offering the
  interactive request; `ensureCameraPermission(interactive: false)` alone is
  a dead end.
- **The test panel must work from a cold start.** It exists to diagnose a
  broken setup, so requiring a running session is backwards. `testPhoto`
  borrows a camera-only session via `withCameraSession` and releases it;
  `testVisualQuery` warms one first; `testDisplay` already made its own.
  Only bridge-mode brain tests still need a session, because they need the
  socket.
- **Stream resolution is negotiated, never assumed.** `addStream` returns a
  bare `nil` (no thrown error, no reason) when the firmware won't serve the
  config you asked for. The Lens live stream used to demand `.high` while
  every path that works on device - one-shot capture, and Meta's own
  CameraAccess sample - uses `.low`; the symptom was "Could not open the
  glasses camera stream" plus a photo-less "remember this person".
  `startLiveStream` now walks `.high → .medium → .low`, twice, and logs
  which one opened. If you add a config knob, ladder it.
- **Navigation needs location BEFORE routing.** `MKDirections` routes from
  `MKMapItem.forCurrentLocation()`, which needs a fix to already exist.
  `startUpdatingLocation()`/`startUpdatingHeading()` therefore run at the
  top of `begin()`, not after the route resolves - otherwise the map screen
  only worked if a voice session had already turned location on. For the
  same reason `handle(location:)` records `lastLocation` *before* its route
  guard: fixes arrive while the route is still computing.
- **The compass must be legible without a Mapbox token.** Heading rotates
  the lens map image, but that image only exists with a token - so turning
  the phone looked like it did nothing. `renderFrame` appends
  "<destination> is to your right" to the step text, which changes as you
  turn either way.
- **Navigation/display callbacks are wired in `init`, not `startSession`.**
  `wireDisplayAndNavigation()` must stay in the initialiser: the map screen
  can start a route with no voice session running, and when `onRoute` was
  nil the route computed correctly but nothing received it - the banner sat
  on "No route running" and every failure was silent. Anything reachable
  without a session must not depend on session-scoped wiring.
- **Heading comes from the phone, never the glasses.** The DAT SDK exposes
  no compass, so `NavigationController` runs `startUpdatingHeading()` and
  publishes `heading` + `relativeBearing` on `RouteSnapshot`. It drives
  three things: the in-app map camera (`followsHeading: true`), the
  direction arrow in the map banner, and the `bearing` parameter on the
  Mapbox static URL so the LENS map turns with the wearer instead of
  staying north-up. Heading repaints are gated at 20° (`minTurnDegrees`) -
  hand-shake would otherwise saturate the lens send throttle. Bearing maths
  is pure and tested in `tests/bearing/`.
- **Two ways to start a route.** Voice resolves a name
  (`start(destination:mode:)`); the map screen's search passes an already
  resolved `MKMapItem` (`start(place:mode:)`) so the user gets the place
  they tapped, not a second geocode of the same string. Suggestions come
  from `PlaceSearch` (MKLocalSearchCompleter), biased to the visible map
  region.
- **Camera permission is TWO different grants.** The glasses camera is
  authorised through the Meta AI companion app
  (`wearables.checkPermissionStatus(.camera)`); the iPhone camera through
  iOS (`AVCaptureDevice`). Capture paths must gate on
  `ensureVisionPermission(interactive:)` and `hasVisionSource`, never on
  `ensureCameraPermission` / `isGlassesConnected` directly - those are the
  glasses answers, and in phone mode they are always no. Four paths were
  silently disabled this way: the encounter photo, direct-mode visual
  queries, conversation-capture snaps, and bridge photo requests.
- **One AVCaptureSession per camera.** In phone mode the session already
  streams for the 5b feed, so a second consumer must observe rather than
  start its own: `addVisionFrameObserver(_:_:)` (keys: `lens`,
  `conversation-capture`) and `visionStreamIsShared`. Never call
  `vision.stopLiveStream()` for a stream you didn't start - it blanks the
  screen the user is looking at.
- **The eye is a visible toggle, not an inference.** `HermesEyeToggle`
  (Glasses / Phone) sits in the session header and writes
  `phoneModePreference` (`.auto` / `.always`); it shows a warning triangle
  when Glasses is selected but unreachable. Don't reintroduce prose that
  explains an inferred state - say it in the control.
- **Never offer "Connect Glasses" to registered glasses.** `startRegistration`
  on an already-registered user throws "User is already registered", which
  is a dead end. `ContentView.GlassesSetupState` splits `notPaired` (pair
  them) from `pairedButUnreachable` (wake them, or re-pair via Settings →
  Devices). Pairing errors route to Devices through `SettingsRoute`.
- **"Are glasses paired" is NOT "can a glasses session start".**
  `registrationState == .registered` and a non-empty `wearables.devices`
  both stay true for glasses that are paired but out of range, while
  `createSession` throws `DeviceSessionError.noEligibleDevice`. The only
  honest predicate is the SDK's own selector:
  `deviceSelector.activeDevice != nil` (`HermesSessionViewModel.glassesAvailable`).
  Getting this wrong made Auto phone-mode never fall back, so Lens, Start
  listening, and the encounter photo all insisted on absent glasses.
  Route selection itself is pure and tested in `tests/vision-routing/`.
- **Never predict hardware without a fallback.** Eligibility can lapse
  between the check and the start, so the glasses path falling through to
  the phone is handled at three points: `startSession()`, `LensViewModel.start()`,
  and `captureVisionPhoto()`. `PhoneCameraManager.capturePhoto()` will spin
  the camera up for a single frame if nothing is streaming, so either eye
  can serve a still. `logVisionDiagnostics(_:)` prints registration, device
  link states, `activeDevice`, and the chosen route - use it before
  theorising about which eye was picked.
- **The vision route is pinned for the life of a session.** `visionRoute`
  is recomputed only while nothing is pinned; a session or the Lens view
  calls `pinVisionRoute`. Without this, a momentary SDK flap redirected a
  capture to a camera that wasn't running (a "remember this person" note
  saved with no photo).
- **Two glasses vendors.** `GlassesVendor` (`glasses_vendor`: `meta` | `aisee`)
  decides what the glasses route means; `VisionRoute` is still `{glasses, phone}`.
  `HermesSessionViewModel.glassesAvailable`, `vision`, `connectGlassesSession`,
  `ensureCameraSession`, permission and display calls branch on it. Switching
  vendor ends the session.
- **AiSee = `Services/AiSee/` (AiSeeGlassKit, copied verbatim from
  `~/Documents/GitHub/aisee-glass-sample`).** Fix kit bugs there first, then
  re-copy. `AiSeeDeviceCoordinator` is the only thing that starts/stops the SDK;
  `AiSeeSequencing` encodes the hardware rules: mic and camera never open
  together (mic closes 400 ms + 300 ms before a still and reopens after),
  stills served from the live frame while streaming, 1 s settle after a stream
  stops. Breaking these wedges the glasses (`device status 4`) until a power
  cycle — `aiseeWedged` takes the route out of service until reconnect.
- **RTK frameworks are device-only.** Linked/embedded via `[sdk=iphoneos*]`
  settings; excluded on the simulator; all kit SDK code is behind
  `#if canImport(RTKAIDeviceConnection)` with stubs. Never add an unconditional
  `import RTK…`.
- **AiSee mic bypasses AVAudioEngine.** `HermesAudioManager.startExternalCapture()`
  + `ingest(_:)` push the kit's 16 kHz Int16 buffers through `processInputBuffer`,
  so recognizer, VAD, recording and level work unchanged. Never toggle
  `AVAudioSession` around a capture (FINDINGS §F). The device streams Opus (16 kHz mono) - the kit decodes with the SDK's `OpusDecoder`/`SBCDecoder` before `PCMResampler`; wiring the resampler to the raw connection fails with `unacceptableData`. Device log: `idevicesyslog -p "Hermes Glasses"` shows `Logger` lines (not `NSLog`).
- **Livestream needs the HotspotConfiguration entitlement** (already present)
  and an iOS local-network/Wi-Fi join prompt on first use.
- **The visual language lives in `Views/HermesDesign.swift`** (imported
  from the "Hermes Glasses UI" design doc, turns 4 + 5). ONE accent -
  terracotta `#C4622D` and its shades; warm neutrals (cream `#F7F5F2`
  canvas, warm black `#1C1B1A`), never stock iOS greys or per-row rainbow
  icons. Build screens out of the primitives there (`HermesSection`,
  `HermesCard`, `HermesRow`, `HermesIconTile`, `HermesChip`,
  `HermesStatusPill`, `HermesDeviceCard`, `HermesScrollPage`) rather than
  re-styling a `List`; pages that keep a stock `Form` (Voice, Display,
  Context…) call the local `hermesFormStyle()` so the canvas matches.
  `HermesMark` is the winged logo as a `Shape` (SVG polygons on a 140x72
  canvas); the wordmark is system `.heavy` + wide tracking, since no
  Montserrat file ships with the app.
- **The test panel is NOT on the session screen** - it lives in
  Settings -> Developer (design 5d) along with the diagnostics rows.
  Nothing floats over the conversation.
- **The session screen's quick actions** (Lens / People / Map / Log) are
  the way into every feature screen; the header keeps only the lockup,
  the glasses pill, new-chat, and the gear.
- **`NavigationMapView` is the in-app route screen** (design 4f), fed by
  `HermesSessionViewModel.activeRoute`, which mirrors
  `NavigationController.onRoute`. Read-only: routes still start by voice
  only; the one control is End route (== "stop navigation").
- **`VoiceCommandCatalog` feeds the "What can I say?" page** from the
  detectors' own phrase lists (`IntentDetector.navTriggers` etc. are internal,
  NOT private, for exactly this). Never hand-copy trigger phrases into the UI -
  add them to the detector and the tester-facing list updates itself.
- **Encounter events are stored raw; grouping happens at render.**
  `EncounterTimeline.build` orders and merges sightings by badge name every
  time the screen draws. The deferred badge-assist pass fills in names
  minutes after the recording ended, and only render-time grouping lets the
  timeline regroup itself when that happens. `Encounter.note` and
  `.photoFilenames` are DERIVED from the events at save time and kept only
  so pre-timeline readers (the People row, the day grouping) still work -
  never treat them as the source of truth for a capture with events.
- **Badge reading is two grants of trust, not two engines.** On-device
  Vision (`BadgeReader`, `usesLanguageCorrection = false` - correction
  mangles surnames) runs at snap time and never leaves the phone. The
  opt-in AI pass (`BadgeAssist`, `badge_assist_enabled`, default off) runs
  ONLY after the encounter is on disk, through
  `DirectClient.askOneShot` - which exists because plain `ask()` would
  splice badge photos into the user's conversation memory. Capped at 6
  reads, 20 s each, abandoned on the first auth failure. When it is on,
  PeopleView's "Stored on this iPhone only" notice MUST change text.
  There is a third source now too: `BarcodeReader` decodes a badge's own
  QR/barcode (vCard, MECARD, opaque id), ranked above OCR because a decode
  isn't a guess. It only ever runs from `BadgeReader.readDetected`, which
  requires a localised badge box - so with no `badge11n.mlpackage` bundled
  yet, the barcode pass is wired up but inert; nothing exercises it on
  device today.
- **Grouping is by badge text, never by face.** Two unbadged sightings never
  merge, no matter how close in time. There is no face recognition in this
  app and adding dwell-adjacency merging would silently claim two people
  are one.
- **Renaming a merged sighting must rename every event under it.** A timeline
  row can be several sightings folded together by badge name, but each is
  still its own stored `EncounterEvent`. Patching only the row's first event
  makes the group keys diverge, and the row visibly SPLITS APART on the next
  render - the user's correction undoing itself in front of them. That is why
  `Row` carries `eventIDs` and why the write goes through
  `EncounterStore.updateBadgeName(encounterID:eventIDs:name:)`, which unifies
  the name while preserving each event's own `rawLines`.
- **The badge is located, not assumed - but the locator doesn't ship yet.**
  `BadgeDetector` wraps an OPTIONAL bundled `badge11n.mlpackage` (4 classes,
  labels must equal `Badge.Kind(detectorLabel:)`'s switch exactly - see
  `tools/train-badge.md`) and, when present, runs on the person crop at
  snap time, never on the live stream. Its box, padded by `BadgeCrop.padding`
  and magnified with `BadgeRegion`'s measured constants, is what OCR, the
  barcode pass and the portrait pass read. No model is bundled today, so
  `BadgeReader` always falls through to the `BadgeRegion` band below - that
  fallback is not a degraded mode to apologise for, it is the floor the
  whole feature stands on, and it stays even once a model ships: for no
  model, no detection, or a detected box that named nobody, so a false
  positive (a shirt pocket clearing `BadgeCrop.minimumConfidence`) can't
  strand OCR on a region with no text when the band might still read it.
  Training images MUST come from the glasses stream at `.low` and
  conversational range - a set shot on crisp phone photos validates
  beautifully and finds nothing on device, the same resolution cliff
  `BadgeRegion.swift`'s header documents from the OCR side. Gate any model
  add or swap on `tools/badge-probe.swift`, not on mAP: the question is
  whether the detected path reads more names than the band on real crops,
  and until it does, the band ships and the model waits.
- **Badges need a REGION and a magnifier, not a bigger threshold.** OCR over
  the whole person crop returns nothing at the resolution the glasses stream:
  a lanyard's name line is under 1% of a head-to-knees crop's height.
  `VNRecognizeTextRequest.minimumTextHeight` is a red herring - lowering it
  changes nothing, because the text never had the pixels. `BadgeReader` runs
  TWO passes: `BadgeRegion`'s upper-torso band upscaled to ~1000 px on the
  short side (this is the one that works), then the whole crop as a safety
  net for a tag worn high or held up. Band lines come FIRST because
  `BadgeParser` takes the first name-shaped line it sees. Re-measure with
  `tools/ocr-probe.swift` before touching the constants - it compiles the
  real `BadgeRegion` and prints old vs new side by side.
- **The recording is the transcript's source, not the live recogniser.**
  `SFSpeechRecognizer` is a dictation model driven one utterance at a time;
  it finalises after 1.5 s of silence and used to rebuild its request between
  utterances, during which `append(_:)` silently dropped every mic buffer -
  which in a two-way conversation is exactly when the other person starts
  talking. Capture now streams the mic to a WAV (`ConversationRecorder`, fed
  by `HermesAudioManager.onRecordChunk` ON THE AUDIO THREAD, ungated by VAD)
  and `TranscriptionService` re-transcribes the finished file, replacing the
  live transcript via `EncounterStore.replaceTranscript`. That store call
  rewrites ONLY speech events - sightings carry the photos and badges and
  their timestamps are what tie a face to a moment - and ignores an empty
  result rather than blanking what was heard live. The WAV is KEPT after
  transcription: on-device recognition is the weakest link here and the audio
  is the only thing that makes a better transcript possible later.
  `rotateCycle()` (not tearDown-then-start) is what closes the buffer gap;
  don't reorder it.
- **What post-hoc transcription does NOT fix is far-field pickup.** The phone
  mic is tuned for the wearer. Someone across a table is often too quiet to
  reach the recogniser at all, recorded or not - that is acoustic, and the
  recording exists so it stays recoverable rather than lost.
- **Recording must start from a cold start.** `toggleConversationCapture`
  calls `startSessionForRecording()` when nothing is running: mic + camera +
  lens, no bridge, no provider, no TTS. `recordingOnlySession` makes
  `submitQuery` DISCARD anything the capture doesn't claim, so an utterance
  in the gap can't be dispatched to a brain that was never connected. The
  Record quick action is deliberately NOT a `HermesApp` - it is an action
  with no screen to present.
- **Badge assist must never outlive `badge_ocr_enabled`.** The assist pass
  selects sightings whose badge is nil. With on-device OCR off, EVERY sighting
  is nil, so assist would run at its full 6-call maximum - turning OCR off to
  stay on-device would silently send the MOST photos to the provider and cost
  the most. `startBadgeAssist` therefore guards on BOTH flags itself; the UI
  greying out a toggle is not a spend guarantee. The per-encounter
  `readBadgesWithAI` button in PeopleView deliberately checks NEITHER flag:
  those govern the pass that fires by itself on every recording, where the
  danger is unnoticed spend, and someone tapping "Read badges with AI" on one
  entry has decided. It is still capped at `BadgeAssist.maxReads` and still
  abandoned on the first auth failure. Without it an all-"Unnamed" capture
  had no route to a name - the only remedy was to flip a global setting and
  have the conversation again.

## Build & run

```bash
# iOS (from repo root; use your own device ID from `xcrun devicectl list devices`)
xcodebuild -project HermesGlasses.xcodeproj -scheme HermesGlasses \
  -destination 'generic/platform=iOS' build

# Bridge (from bridge/) - logs to stdout; tests:
python -m unittest test_hermes_bridge -v
```

### Two traps in the standalone test suites

- **`tests/*/main.swift` end in `print(...)` then `exit(...)`.** New assertions
  must be INSERTED ABOVE those two lines. Appended to the bottom they sit
  after `exit()`, never run, and the suite still reports all-green - so the
  tests look like they pass when they were never executed.
- **`AIProvider.swift` does not compile alone.** `AIProviderRegistry`
  references `AnthropicProvider`, `OpenAICompatibleProvider` and
  `GeminiProvider`, so any suite needing `AIProviderError` (or anything else
  from that file) must list all four provider sources on the `swiftc` line.
  `tests/providers/main.swift`'s header carries the canonical command.

## Next milestones

- Route audio through the glasses microphone (`startCapture(useGlassesMic:
  true)`, HFP path) - currently the iPhone mic is used.
- Normalize EXIF rotation of glasses photos before sending to Hermes.
- Word-boundary matching for visual keywords ("outlook" currently matches
  "look").
