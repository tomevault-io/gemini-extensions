# Knowder Library Development Rules

## Project Context
You are helping develop "Knowder" - a lightweight JavaScript library for displaying engaging facts during loading states. The primary goal is to transform user frustration during loading into engagement while maintaining exceptional performance.

## Core Principles (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

### 1. Bundle Size Supremacy
- **HARD LIMIT**: <5KB gzipped final bundle
- Every byte matters - question every character
- Use bundlesize tool to verify on every build
- NO external runtime dependencies (zero dependencies rule)
- Vanilla JavaScript only - no frameworks

### 2. Performance First
- Initialization must be <50ms
- Memory usage must stay <1MB
- Maintain 60fps animations
- CPU impact <1% during idle
- Use native CSS transitions/animations only
- Optimize for browser rendering engine

### 3. Developer Experience Excellence
- API must be intuitive (max 3 main methods)
- Zero configuration should work out of box
- Framework agnostic design
- Comprehensive documentation with examples
- Clear error messages and graceful degradation

## Technical Constraints

### Code Style & Patterns
- Use ES6+ features (target modern browsers only)
- Prefer functional programming patterns where possible
- Use singleton pattern for main API
- Implement proper error handling and input validation
- Comment complex logic thoroughly
- Use JSDoc for all public methods

### DOM Manipulation Rules
- Use native DOM APIs only (no jQuery)
- Minimize DOM queries and mutations
- Use documentFragment for complex DOM operations
- Implement proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks
- Respect user accessibility preferences

### Animation Guidelines
- CSS transitions/animations only (no JavaScript animations)
- Use transform and opacity for GPU acceleration
- Respect prefers-reduced-motion media query
- Keep animations smooth and non-jarring
- Aim for 60fps performance

### File Organization
```
src/
├── core/
│   ├── factLoader.js    # Main API class
│   ├── factStorage.js   # Data management
│   └── display.js       # DOM/animation engine
├── data/
│   └── defaultFacts.js  # Default fact database
└── index.js             # Public API exports
```

## Development Workflow Rules

### Testing Requirements
- Maintain 90%+ test coverage
- Write tests before implementing features (TDD)
- Test in multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Include accessibility testing
- Performance regression testing

### Code Quality Gates
1. All tests must pass
2. Bundle size must be <5KB gzipped
3. ESLint must pass with zero warnings
4. No console.log statements in production code
5. Proper JSDoc documentation for all public APIs

### Git Commit Guidelines
- Use conventional commit format
- Include bundle size impact in commit messages
- Reference TODO items being completed
- Small, focused commits

## API Design Rules

### Public API Surface
```javascript
// Main methods (keep to 3 maximum)
Knowder.init(options)     // Initialize with config
Knowder.start(category)   // Start displaying facts
Knowder.stop()           // Stop and cleanup

// Utility methods (minimal)
Knowder.addFacts(category, facts)  // Add custom facts
Knowder.getCategories()            // List categories
```

### Configuration Schema
- Use sensible defaults for everything
- Make all options optional
- Validate input and provide clear error messages
- Support both programmatic and declarative configuration

### Error Handling Strategy
- Never crash the host application
- Use console.warn for non-critical errors
- Provide fallback behavior for all scenarios
- Clear error messages with suggested fixes

## Content Guidelines

### Default Facts Criteria
- Must be genuinely interesting and surprising
- Keep under 140 characters for readability
- Verify accuracy before inclusion
- Ensure cultural sensitivity and inclusivity
- Categorize appropriately (general, science, tech, history)

### Fact Quality Standards
- Prefer "did you know" style revelations
- Include credible sources in comments
- Avoid controversial or sensitive topics
- Make facts universally understandable
- Test readability with diverse audiences

## Browser Support Strategy

### Supported Browsers
- Chrome 88+ (ES6 modules, modern CSS)
- Firefox 78+ (similar feature support)
- Safari 14+ (WebKit parity)
- Edge 88+ (Chromium-based)

### Feature Detection
- Use feature detection over browser detection
- Graceful degradation for unsupported features
- No polyfills (to maintain zero dependencies)
- Progressive enhancement approach

## Build & Distribution Rules

### Build Process
- Use Rollup.js for optimal tree shaking
- Generate both ESM and UMD builds
- Aggressive minification with Terser
- Source maps for debugging
- Automated bundle analysis

### Quality Assurance
- Run bundlesize check on every build
- Lighthouse performance audits
- Cross-browser automated testing
- Accessibility compliance verification
- Security vulnerability scanning

## Documentation Standards

### Code Documentation
- JSDoc for all public methods and classes
- Include usage examples in comments
- Document performance characteristics
- Explain design decisions in complex code

### User Documentation
- Quick start guide with working examples
- Complete API reference
- Framework integration examples
- Troubleshooting guide
- Performance best practices

## When Suggesting Code

### Always Consider
1. "Does this add unnecessary bytes to the bundle?"
2. "Could this impact performance negatively?"
3. "Is this the simplest possible solution?"
4. "Does this maintain backward compatibility?"
5. "Is this accessible to all users?"

### Code Review Checklist
- [ ] Bundle size impact assessed
- [ ] Performance implications considered
- [ ] Error handling implemented
- [ ] Tests written/updated
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Accessibility verified

## Emergency Protocols

### If Bundle Size Exceeds Limit
1. STOP all development
2. Analyze what caused the increase
3. Remove/optimize offending code
4. Consider if feature is essential
5. Document decision rationale

### If Performance Regresses
1. Identify the performance bottleneck
2. Use browser dev tools to profile
3. Optimize the critical path
4. Add performance test to prevent regression
5. Update performance documentation

## Success Metrics to Track

### Technical Metrics
- Bundle size trend
- Initialization time
- Memory usage pattern
- Test coverage percentage
- Documentation completeness

### User Experience Metrics
- API ease of use
- Developer onboarding time
- Integration complexity
- Community feedback sentiment
- Bug report frequency

Remember: Every decision should be evaluated through the lens of performance, simplicity, and developer experience. When in doubt, choose the solution that maintains the smallest bundle size and clearest API.
