# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What This Is

Wikifier is a **zero-dependency, agent-to-agent codebase wiki**: it gives AI agents a token-efficient, queryable map of a codebase (health matrix, dependency graph, per-file wiki summaries) so they can look things up instead of re-reading full sources. The human layer (`index.html` dashboard) is strictly secondary — a read-only viewer of the same artifacts. It is deliberately NOT a general human documentation tool.

**This repo dogfoods itself.** Wikifier runs on its own source, and you are expected to follow its agent protocol when working here (see below). The authoritative agent contract is `skills/run.md` (Agent Protocol v0.5) — read it before substantive work.

## Hard Constraints

- **NON-NEGOTIABLE: effectively zero-dependency.** The core must run on pure Python stdlib (>=3.8) + POSIX shell alone — `pyproject.toml` declares `dependencies = []` and that stays. The reason is architectural, not stylistic: anyone forking this project must be free to bring their own third-party libraries on top of a dependency-free base. Therefore: never add a runtime dependency, never couple core logic to an optional extra (the `mcp` extra must remain strictly optional and isolated to `wikifier/mcp/`), and never make core behavior degrade when nothing beyond the stdlib is installed.
- **`library.md`, `file_health.md`, `pending_updates.md` are generated/managed artifacts.** Never hand-edit `library.md` (overwritten by `update-maps`); mutate health/pending only through the official commands (they hold locks).
- **Human-layer separation:** only `index.html` is deployed to target projects on `init`. `diagnostics.html` is maintainer-only and stays in this repo.
- Agent-to-agent scope only — do not grow features toward general human docs or IDE use.

## Mandatory Workflow (the project's own protocol)

After any source edit in this repo:

```bash
wikifier check-changes                                   # what's dirty; read file_health.md + pending_updates.md
# ... edit source (prioritize 🔴 Red, then 🟡 Yellow) ...
wikifier record-change "path/to/file" "why (semantic reason, include subid for agent work)"   # REQUIRED — never skip
# ... update the file's wiki entry (*.wiki.md or library summary) ...
wikifier mark-green "path/to/file" "reason"
wikifier update-maps                                     # only when imports/structure changed
wikifier health --summary                                # re-validate at end of session
```

`record-change` is the semantic audit trail (journal + health + pending) — skipping it breaks the system's core value. For edits to agent-maintained docs (skills/run.md, README, Findings/M5-*.md), precede with "FRESH 3" hygiene: grep the target for 0 stale/deferred matches first.

The Wikifier MCP server may be connected (tools like `get_project_status`, `get_dependencies`, `get_file_wiki`, `record_change`, `mark_green`). Prefer MCP tools when available; the CLI/library is the battle-tested fallback (MCP can time out on very large barrel-heavy targets). For any external project, always pass explicit `project_root=` or `WIKIFIER_PROJECT_ROOT=`.

## Commands

```bash
pip install -e .                       # dev install (entry points: wikifier, wikifier-mcp)
python -m wikifier <command>           # equivalent to the wikifier entry point
./wikifier.sh <command>                # shell launcher (root copy; packaged copy in wikifier/scripts/)
wikifier init [--target DIR]           # bootstrap a target project (copies only index.html)
wikifier update-maps [--full] [--directory=src/] [--max-files=N]   # rebuild dependency graph + library.md (pure-Python pipeline; wikifier.sh delegates here — the in-shell first-pass was retired, --sh is a deprecated no-op)
wikifier health [--summary|--json]     # health matrix (use --summary/--json for machine consumption)
wikifier monitor &                     # background incremental heartbeat
wikifier daemon {start|stop|status}    # managed background maintenance
WIKIFIER_PROJECT_ROOT=/abs/path wikifier-mcp   # MCP server (requires pip install wikifier[mcp])
./scripts/publish.sh [test|prod]       # PyPI release (build + twine)
```

**Tests:** `python -m unittest discover tests` (pure stdlib unittest — no pytest, per the zero-dependency rule; ~49 tests covering parsers, cache schema, cycles, barrel invalidation, health workflow, gap-closure hygiene). Run it after any core change. Additionally verify by dogfooding: `wikifier check-changes`, `wikifier update-maps` (catches parse/pipeline errors), `wikifier health --summary`, and MCP smoke calls (`get_project_status`, `suggest_next_actions`), then confirm the artifacts (file_health.md, library.md) look right.

## Architecture

Pipeline: **scan → parse → resolve → cache → health → artifacts**, all under `wikifier/` (~19.8k LOC pure stdlib; package version in `wikifier/__init__.py`, currently 4.5.x).

- `cli.py` — entry point, unified project-root discovery (env var → `.wikifier/`/marker walk → `.git`/manifest markers → cwd), and `run_full_update()` — the pure-Python pipeline (dirty detection → parsers → persist → cycles → ACS).
- `parsers/python.py`, `parsers/javascript.py` — regex-based import extraction (zero-dep), returning a rich shared contract per edge: resolved path, confidence score/reasons/explanation, dynamic/conditional analysis, barrel info, strategy provenance.
- `parsers/cdia.py` — **CDIA**: pluggable registry of 12 detectors for conditional imports (feature flags, env checks, ternaries) and dynamic imports (computed paths, dataflow aliases, registry maps).
- `parsers/bree.py` — **BREE**: barrel/re-export chain expansion (bounded depth 3, cycle-safe) with mtime-aware persistent cache and reverse index used for stale-importer invalidation.
- `resolution.py` — single source of truth for path canonicalization (symlinks, TS paths, package.json exports, workspaces). All identity goes through `to_canonical_rel`.
- `import_cache.py` — persistence + graph intelligence in `.wikifier_staging/import_cache.json`: resolved pairs, Tarjan SCC cycles with **CIABRE** break recommendations, reverse dependencies, **ACS** aggregation. Reserved keys start with `_` (`_cycles`, `_acs_summary`, `_barrel_resolutions`, …). A 48-bit graph signature short-circuits recomputes when topology is unchanged.
- `health.py` — 🟢/🟡/🔴 matrix (`file_health.json` is source of truth; `.md` regenerated on save) with freshness tracking (`wiki_content_hash`, `last_meaningful_edit` vs `last_wiki_refresh`) and stale-wiki detection. Prunes out-of-tree entries to prevent cross-project pollution.
- `contracts.py` — frozen shared dataclasses/shapes (CDIA v1, barrel v2, ResolutionMetadata, `compute_acs_confidence`) keeping parsers/cache/MCP from drifting. New fields are additive only; pipe payloads are versioned base64 (`cdia_v1`, `barrel_v2`, `res_meta_v1`).
- `locking.py` — advisory project-level `fcntl.flock` on `.wikifier_staging/.lock`; shell paths use mkdir locks. High-level tools lock automatically; never bypass them with raw writes to state files.
- `daemon.py` — background loop running check-changes + update-maps.
- `mcp/server.py` — optional MCP server exposing ~23 tools that delegate to the library (workflow: `check_changes`/`record_change`/`mark_green`; intel: `get_dependencies`, `get_cycles`, `get_barrel_reports`, `get_resolution_diagnostics`; status: `get_project_status`, `health`, `suggest_next_actions`).

Generated artifacts (in the target project root): `file_health.md/.json`, `library.md` (Mermaid + dependency tables + ACS/cycle reports), `pending_updates.md`, `journal/YYYY/MM/DD.md` (audit trail), per-file `*.wiki.md`, `.wikifier_staging/` (cache, locks, daemon state). Scoping for large repos: `monitored_paths.txt` (use absolute paths for external projects) and `exclude_patterns.txt`.

Adding a language = new `wikifier/parsers/{lang}.py` exposing `parse_{lang}_imports(filepath) -> List[Dict]` with the same edge contract.

## Versioning & Releases

- Version lives in `wikifier/__init__.py` (`__version__`); pyproject reads it dynamically. SemVer + Keep a Changelog format in `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Protocol versions (`skills/run.md`) are independent of package version; mandatory I/O changes require a protocol version bump with migration notes there.
- Agents must tolerate additive fields in dict returns; library returns always include `"success": bool`. Operational failures return `{"success": False, "error": ...}`; contract misuse raises.

## Repo Map (beyond the package)

- `skills/run.md` — the agent protocol (primary contract for any LLM operating Wikifier)
- `docs/spec.md` — spec and guiding principles
- `Findings/` — M5 real-world dogfood evidence (kept lean; historical plans pruned)
- `SIMPLIFICATION_PLAN_AND_LOG.md` — log of the simplification phases
- `file_health.md`, `pending_updates.md`, `journal/`, `library.md` — this repo's own live wiki state (dogfood)
