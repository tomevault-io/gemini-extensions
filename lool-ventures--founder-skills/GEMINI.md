## Plugin Structure

- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` — Marketplace manifest (root level)
- `founder-skills/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` — Plugin manifest with hooks
- marketplace.json must match Anthropic's format: only `name`, `owner`, `plugins` (each with `name`, `source`, `description`)
- Do NOT add `version` or `metadata` fields to marketplace.json

## Script Conventions

- Scripts use PEP 723 inline metadata; default to `python`, `uv run` optional
- Scripts output JSON to stdout, warnings/errors to stderr
- All scripts support `--pretty` for human-readable output and `-o <file>` to write to file (skill scripts emit a JSON receipt to stdout confirming the write)
- Skill-local scripts live in `founder-skills/skills/<skill>/scripts/`

## Shared Scripts

- **`founder_context.py`** — Per-company context management (init/read/merge/validate subcommands); protects 11 key metric fields
- **`find_artifact.py`** — Resolves artifact paths by skill name, artifact filename, and optional company slug

## Market Sizing Scripts

- **`market_sizing.py`** — TAM/SAM/SOM calculator (top-down, bottom-up, or both)
- **`sensitivity.py`** — Stress-test assumptions with low/base/high ranges and confidence-based auto-widening
- **`checklist.py`** — Validates 22-item self-check with pass/fail per item
- **`compose_report.py`** — Assembles report from artifacts, validates cross-artifact consistency
- **`visualize.py`** — Generates self-contained HTML with SVG charts; outputs HTML (not JSON)

## Deck Review Scripts

- **`checklist.py`** — Scores 35 criteria across 7 categories (pass/fail/warn/not_applicable) with overall score percentage
- **`compose_report.py`** — Assembles deck review artifacts into final report with cross-artifact validation
- **`visualize.py`** — Generates self-contained HTML with SVG charts; outputs HTML (not JSON)

## IC Simulation Scripts

- **`fund_profile.py`** — Validates fund profile structure (archetypes, check size, thesis, portfolio)
- **`detect_conflicts.py`** — Validates agent-produced conflict assessments and computes summary stats
- **`score_dimensions.py`** — Scores 28 dimensions across 7 categories with conviction-based scoring
- **`compose_report.py`** — Assembles IC simulation artifacts into final report with cross-artifact validation
- **`visualize.py`** — Generates self-contained HTML with SVG charts; outputs HTML (not JSON)

## Financial Model Review Scripts

- **`extract_model.py`** — Extracts structured data from Excel (.xlsx) and CSV files into model_data.json
- **`validate_extraction.py`** — Anti-hallucination gate: cross-references model_data.json against inputs.json (company name, salary, revenue, cash traceability, scale plausibility); `--fix` auto-corrects scale denomination issues (e.g., model in $000)
- **`validate_inputs.py`** — Four-layer validation of inputs.json (structural, consistency, sanity, completeness); `--fix` auto-corrects sign errors
- **`checklist.py`** — Scores 46 criteria across 7 categories with profile-based auto-gating by stage/geography/sector
- **`unit_economics.py`** — Computes and benchmarks 11 unit economics metrics against stage-appropriate targets
- **`runway.py`** — Multi-scenario runway stress-test with decision points and default-alive analysis
- **`compose_report.py`** — Assembles financial model review artifacts into final report with cross-artifact validation
- **`visualize.py`** — Generates self-contained HTML with SVG charts; outputs HTML (not JSON)
- **`explore.py`** — Generates self-contained interactive HTML explorer from review artifacts; outputs HTML (not JSON)
- **`review_inputs.py`** — Dual-mode review viewer: HTTP server with live validation (Claude Code) or self-contained static HTML with JS sanity metrics (Cowork); outputs HTML
- **`apply_corrections.py`** — Processes founder's downloaded corrections file: coerces, normalizes, merges overrides, writes corrected_inputs.json + extraction_corrections.json
- **`verify_review.py`** — Review completeness gate: checks artifact existence, content quality (evidence, critical fields, metrics), and cross-artifact consistency; exit 0 = publishable, exit 1 = gaps

## Dev Setup

Install dev dependencies:

```bash
uv sync --extra dev
# or: pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Linting & Formatting

```bash
uv run ruff check .          # lint
uv run ruff format .         # auto-format
uv run ruff format --check . # check formatting without changes
```

## Type Checking

Scripts in different skills share filenames (`checklist.py`, `compose_report.py`), so mypy must be run per directory:

```bash
uv run mypy founder-skills/skills/market-sizing/scripts/
uv run mypy founder-skills/skills/deck-review/scripts/
uv run mypy founder-skills/skills/ic-sim/scripts/
uv run mypy founder-skills/skills/financial-model-review/scripts/
uv run mypy founder-skills/tests/
```

## Running Tests

```bash
uv run pytest                        # all tests
uv run pytest founder-skills/tests/ -v  # verbose
```

## Internal Docs

- `docs/internal/` — Design docs and internal notes; never tracked or committed (gitignored)

## Hooks

- **SessionStart** (`founder-skills/scripts/session-setup.sh`): Persists `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` into `CLAUDE_ENV_FILE` so scripts can locate plugin files at runtime.

## Installing the Plugin in Claude Cowork

Customize → "+" on the "Personal Plugins" list → Browse Plugins → Personal → +

Then add the marketplace repo (`lool-ventures/founder-skills`) and install the `founder-skills` plugin.

**Start a new Cowork session** after installing — already-running sessions won't pick up the plugin.

## Updating Plugin Files in Cowork Without Reinstalling

Cowork caches plugin files per-session. To hot-patch files for testing without reinstalling:

1. Find the session cache:
   ```bash
   find ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/local-agent-mode-sessions -name "SKILL.md" -path "*ic-sim*" 2>/dev/null
   ```

2. There are typically 4 copies per session — 2 marketplace names × (`cache/` + `marketplaces/`):
   ```
   cowork_plugins/cache/<marketplace>/<plugin>/<version>/
   cowork_plugins/marketplaces/<marketplace>/<plugin-dir>/
   ```

3. Copy modified files into all locations:
   ```bash
   SRC="founderskills"
   COWORK_BASE="$HOME/Library/Application Support/Claude/local-agent-mode-sessions/<org-id>/<session-id>/cowork_plugins"
   TARGETS=(
     "$COWORK_BASE/cache/<marketplace1>/<plugin>/<version>"
     "$COWORK_BASE/cache/<marketplace2>/<plugin>/<version>"
     "$COWORK_BASE/marketplaces/<marketplace1>/<plugin-dir>"
     "$COWORK_BASE/marketplaces/<marketplace2>/<plugin-dir>"
   )
   for target in "${TARGETS[@]}"; do
     cp "$SRC/skills/ic-sim/SKILL.md" "$target/skills/ic-sim/SKILL.md"
     # ... repeat for each modified file
   done
   ```

4. **Start a new Cowork session** — already-running sessions have already loaded skill bodies into context.

## Removing / Refreshing a Plugin in Claude Code / Cowork

There is no UI to remove a marketplace. Edit config files directly.

### Claude Code (CLI)

- `~/.claude/plugins/known_marketplaces.json` — delete the marketplace entry
- `~/.claude/plugins/installed_plugins.json` — delete any `pluginname@marketplace` entries
- `~/.claude/plugins/cache/<marketplace>/` — delete to reclaim disk space

### Cowork (Desktop App) — stale version troubleshooting

When Cowork won't pick up a new version, nuke all three locations:

```bash
BASE="$HOME/Library/Application Support/Claude/local-agent-mode-sessions/<org-id>/<user-id>/cowork_plugins"
rm -rf "$BASE/cache/<marketplace>"
rm -rf "$BASE/marketplaces/<marketplace>"
rm -f "$BASE/.install-manifests/<plugin>@<marketplace>.json"
```

Then remove the entries from `known_marketplaces.json` and `installed_plugins.json`, restart Cowork, and re-add the marketplace.

**Tip:** `installed_plugins.json` pins a `gitCommitSha` — compare against `git rev-parse HEAD` to check freshness.

**Pitfall:** When deleting an entry from these JSON files, ensure the preceding entry's trailing comma is removed if it becomes the last entry. A trailing comma produces invalid JSON that `JSON.parse()` rejects, causing "Failed to add marketplace" errors in Cowork.
