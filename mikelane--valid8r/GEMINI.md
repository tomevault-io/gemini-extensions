Cursor Project Rules

[available_instructions]

# ---------- Language-agnostic AI operating rules ----------
ai_alignment:
  # Clarify the ask and fit the context
  • Restate the task, inputs, outputs, constraints, and success criteria before writing code.
  • Detect and follow the project’s stack, runtime, CI, testing style, and naming/layout conventions.
  • Surface tradeoffs: propose a primary approach and at least one viable alternative with pros/cons.

ai_small_steps:
  # Keep changes tiny and reversible
  • Prefer minimal, incremental diffs gated by tests; one responsibility per change.
  • Use feature flags/toggles or adapters for risky changes.
  • Avoid speculative generality; implement the smallest thing that could possibly work.

ai_correct_first:
  # Make it work before making it fast/fancy
  • Provide runnable examples and tests that demonstrate behavior.
  • Specify behavior via public surfaces; avoid coupling tests to internals.
  • Cover golden path, edge cases, and failure modes.

ai_readability:
  # Clear beats clever
  • Favor descriptive names, short functions, cohesive modules.
  • Remove duplication; maintain a single source of truth.
  • Isolate complex logic behind simple interfaces.

ai_design_for_change:
  # Stable boundaries, evolvable internals
  • Program to interfaces/abstractions; hide implementation details.
  • Validate at the edges; keep core logic working on trusted data.
  • For legacy code, prefer strangler patterns and incremental replacement over rewrites.

ai_refactoring:
  # Improve safely with a net
  • Refactor only with passing tests; preserve behavior.
  • Apply the scout rule: leave touched code cleaner.
  • For perf-sensitive areas, capture before/after metrics.

ai_security_reliability:
  # Non-optional requirements
  • Enforce least privilege for code, data, secrets, and CI.
  • Validate and sanitize all inputs (type/range/format); fail closed with secure defaults.
  • Add observability at service/module boundaries: structured logs, key metrics, trace points.

ai_performance:
  # Pragmatic optimization
  • Make it work, then measure; optimize only with evidence.
  • Prefer simpler algorithms until data proves otherwise.
  • Call out expected time/space/IO complexity and resource budgets.

ai_dependency_hygiene:
  # Keep the supply chain tidy
  • Prefer standard libraries and fewer dependencies when reasonable.
  • Track versions, licenses, and security advisories; pin/lock where appropriate.
  • Wrap third-party libraries behind thin, swappable adapters.

ai_docs:
  # Documentation that earns its keep
  • Update API/module docs when behavior or surfaces change; describe behavior, inputs, outputs, invariants.
  • Prefer runnable examples to prose where possible.
  • Delete or update stale docs; stale docs are bugs.

ai_vcs_etiquette:
  # Version control best practices
  • Make atomic commits with messages that explain “why” before “what.”
  • Ensure tests/linters/static analysis pass locally before opening a PR/MR.
  • PR/MR descriptions should include context, decisions, risks, and validation notes.

ai_collaboration:
  # Human-friendly by default
  • Ask clarifying questions when requirements are ambiguous; do not guess silently.
  • Offer 2–3 options with consequences when tradeoffs exist.
  • Match the project’s code style, directory layout, and tooling.

ai_ethics_guardrails:
  # Do the right thing
  • Respect licenses; verify compatibility before suggesting code.
  • Attribute significant ideas/snippets that are not original.
  • Never expose secrets or PII in code, logs, examples, or test data.

ai_definition_of_done:
  # Quality bar for AI-produced changes
  • Task restated; constraints and acceptance criteria confirmed.
  • Approach and alternatives documented (in PR/MR or design note).
  • Code compiles/runs cleanly; linting/formatting/static analysis are clean.
  • Tests exist, pass locally, and demonstrate behavior and edge cases.
  • Security, error handling, and observability addressed where relevant.
  • Public surfaces documented; docs/doctests updated.

ai_escalation:
  # Know when to pause and propose a design
  • Conflicting requirements or missing success criteria.
  • Meaningful risk of data loss/security exposure without a rollback plan.
  • Changes imply architectural shifts; produce a short design note first.

ai_operating_sequence:
  # Step-by-step workflow for Cursor
  1. Confirm: restate task/constraints/acceptance criteria; ask blocking questions.
  2. Plan: outline a tiny increment that delivers user value; note tradeoffs.
  3. Propose: show tests first, then implementation; keep diff small.
  4. Validate: enumerate edge cases, security checks, and perf notes.
  5. Refine: simplify names/structure; remove duplication.
  6. Deliver: provide patch + tests + concise PR description with rationale and follow-ups.
  7. Iterate: accept feedback; repeat in small steps.

# ---------- Existing repo-specific testing/style guidance ----------
pytest_naming:
  Use pytest discovery configuration from pyproject.toml:
    • test paths: tests
    • test files: it_*.py, test_*.py
    • test classes: Describe[A-Z]*
    • test functions: it_*
  When creating new tests:
    • Mirror src/valid8r/... structure under tests/....
    • Use classes like DescribeThing with methods it_describes_behavior.
    • Prefer @pytest.mark.parametrize (see parametrization_policy).
    • For async code, mark tests with @pytest.mark.asyncio.

testing_principles:
  Adopt Software Engineering at Google testing practices:
    • Test behavior, not implementation (assert on public surface; avoid peeking at internals/private state).
    • Small and hermetic: no network, no real filesystem (use tmp_path), no time dependence (inject a clock or freeze time).
    • Deterministic: seed randomness; avoid sleeps and flakiness; keep timeouts tight.
    • DAMP not DRY in tests: prioritize clarity over reuse; duplication in tests is fine when it improves readability.
    • One concept per test: each test should fail for a single understandable reason.
    • Clear names as specification: DescribeFoo.it_rejects_empty_input style; prefer long, descriptive names.
    • Use fakes over mocks when possible; prefer dependency injection to make seams explicit.
    • Don’t assert on log messages unless the log is a defined behavior.
    • Coverage is a byproduct, not the goal; prioritize risk and critical paths.
    • Keep fixtures simple and local; avoid deep fixture hierarchies that obscure intent.

fixtures_and_mocks:
  • Prefer pytest fixtures for setup; avoid xUnit setup/teardown.
  • Use MagicMock/AsyncMock sparingly; favor fakes/simple test doubles.
  • For static data, use pytest_lambda.static_fixture.
  • Use monkeypatch for env vars and module-level patching.
  • Isolate global state; reset or inject dependencies per test.

io_and_time_isolation:
  • Use tmp_path/tmp_path_factory for any filesystem work.
  • For time, inject a clock callable or use freezegun.freeze_time in tests.

parametrization_policy:
  Prefer parametrized tests. Use indirect parametrization when constructing objects/fixtures is non-trivial or when parameters map to fixtures.

  Direct example:

    @pytest.mark.parametrize(
        "raw,expected",
        [
            pytest.param("42", 42, id="pos-42"),
            pytest.param("0", 0, id="zero"),
            pytest.param("-1", -1, id="neg-1"),
        ],
    )
    def it_parses_integers(raw, expected):
        assert parsers.int(raw) == expected

  Indirect example:

    @pytest.fixture
    def user(request):
        return User(name=request.param["name"], role=request.param["role"])

    @pytest.mark.parametrize(
        "user,allowed",
        [
            pytest.param({"name": "alice", "role": "admin"}, True, id="admin-allowed"),
            pytest.param({"name": "bob", "role": "viewer"}, False, id="viewer-denied"),
        ],
        indirect=["user"],
    )
    def it_checks_access(user, allowed):
        assert can_access(user) is allowed

  IDs:
    Provide excellent, human-readable ids for each case:
      • Short, kebab-case descriptions of behavior (e.g., empty-input, admin-allowed, viewer-denied).
      • Include critical parameter hints when useful (e.g., neg-1, boundary-0, unicode-snowman).
      • Avoid opaque numeric-only ids.

public_api_reexports:
  valid8r top-level must re-export:
    • modules: parsers, validators, combinators, and prompt (with ask exposed in valid8r.prompt).
    • types: Maybe from valid8r.core.maybe.
  Maintain backward compatibility for deep imports.
  When changing exports:
    • Update __all__ in valid8r/__init__.py and valid8r/prompt/__init__.py.
    • Update public API tests (see public_api_test_template).
    • Public API code should have high-quality docstrings and doctests (see public_api_docs).

  Mini __init__.py export pattern:

    # valid8r/__init__.py
    from __future__ import annotations

    from . import parsers, validators, combinators, prompt
    from .core.maybe import Maybe

    __all__ = [
        "parsers",
        "validators",
        "combinators",
        "prompt",
        "Maybe",
    ]

    # valid8r/prompt/__init__.py
    from __future__ import annotations

    from .ask import ask

    __all__ = ["ask"]

  Tiny indirect parametrized test using the public API:

    import pytest
    from valid8r import prompt

    @pytest.fixture
    def question(request):
        # Imagine 'ask' uses this question text internally
        return request.param

    @pytest.mark.parametrize(
        "question,expected_callable",
        [
            pytest.param("What is your name?", True, id="simple-question"),
            pytest.param("Choose an option: [a/b]", True, id="multiple-choice"),
        ],
        indirect=["question"],
    )
    def it_exposes_prompt_ask_as_callable(question, expected_callable):
        # Public API behavior: 'ask' must always be callable
        assert callable(prompt.ask) is expected_callable

public_api_test_template:
  Create/maintain tests/it_public_api.py:

    import importlib

    def it_exposes_expected_symbols():
        v = importlib.import_module("valid8r")
        assert hasattr(v, "parsers")
        assert hasattr(v, "validators")
        assert hasattr(v, "combinators")
        from valid8r import prompt, Maybe  # noqa: F401
        assert callable(prompt.ask)

    def it_preserves_deep_imports_for_backcompat():
        assert importlib.import_module("valid8r.core.maybe").Maybe is not None

public_api_docs:
  Public API must include detailed docstrings with realistic doctests (serve as examples and executable checks).
    • Write WHY in comments/docstrings; code should explain WHAT via names/types.
    • Example:

      def parse_positive_int(text: str) -> int:
          """
          Parse a string into a positive integer.

          Accepts optional leading/trailing whitespace and '+' sign.
          Raises ValueError for non-integer or non-positive values.

          Examples:
              >>> parse_positive_int("  +7 ")
              7
              >>> parse_positive_int("0")
              Traceback (most recent call last):
              ...
              ValueError: expected a positive integer
          """
          ...

    • Keep doctests fast and hermetic; avoid I/O and network.

comment_policy:
  Keep comments minimal. Only explain WHY something is done if it is non-obvious or encodes a business rule.
    • Do not narrate obvious steps.
    • Public API is the exception: include rich docstrings + doctests.

typing_and_style:
  • All new/changed Python must be fully type-annotated.
  • Code must pass mypy (repo config) and ruff (repo rules).
  • Avoid unrelated reformatting; only change lines necessary for the task.

run_tests_locally:
  In constrained environments without pytest installed, create smoke_test.py:

    from valid8r import parsers, validators, prompt, Maybe
    assert callable(prompt.ask)
    print("ok")

  Make it runnable with: python smoke_test.py

ci_expectations:
  • Follow TDD: write a failing test, write the minimum code to pass, then refactor both.
  • Unit tests should be fast (<1s each where practical); mark slower ones @pytest.mark.slow.
  • Tests are hermetic by default; mark any external integrations as @pytest.mark.integration.

# ---------- Defaults applied to all requests ----------
[default]
  # Operating mode summary (language-agnostic)
  • Apply ai_operating_sequence; keep changes small and reversible.
  • Follow ai_alignment, ai_correct_first, ai_readability, ai_design_for_change.
  • Enforce ai_security_reliability, ai_performance, ai_dependency_hygiene.
  • Honor ai_vcs_etiquette, ai_docs, ai_collaboration, ai_ethics_guardrails.
  • Meet ai_definition_of_done; use ai_escalation when needed.

  # Repo-specific testing/style
  • Use Describe*/it_* names that read like a spec; mirror src under tests.
  • Apply Google testing principles: behavior-based, small, hermetic, deterministic, DAMP.
  • Prefer parametrization; use indirect parametrization for non-trivial setup; use pytest.param with excellent ids.
  • Keep comments minimal (WHY only). Public API gets rich docstrings + doctests.
  • Prefer fixtures + (Async)MagicMock (sparingly) + pytest_lambda.static_fixture.
  • Use tmp_path, monkeypatch, and frozen/injected time for isolation.
  • Maintain public API exports and back-compat; keep public API tests and docs in sync.
  • Match repo style (ruff) and types (mypy); avoid drive-by reformatting.
