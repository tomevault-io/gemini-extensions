# AGENTS.md - AI Agent Guidelines for Evon Smart Home

**IMPORTANT FOR CLAUDE:** This is the primary reference document. Always check this file first when working with this codebase. The Evon MCP server is available for direct API queries - prefer using it over writing scripts.

**Commit messages:** Do not add Co-Authored-By lines to commit messages.

**Before committing:** Always run `ruff check custom_components/evon/ tests/ && ruff format --check custom_components/evon/ tests/` to catch linting/formatting issues before they fail CI. Use `--fix` and `ruff format` to auto-fix.

**GitHub Releases:** Do NOT include the version number in the release title. HACS automatically prepends the tag name (e.g., `v1.19.2 - `), so including it in the title creates duplication like `v1.19.2 - v1.19.2 — Fix ...`. Use only a descriptive title, e.g., `--title "Fix double-click detection"`.

This document provides critical information for AI agents working with this codebase.

## Project Overview

This repository contains two integrations for Evon Smart Home systems:
- **MCP Server** (`src/index.ts`) - TypeScript-based Model Context Protocol server
- **Home Assistant Integration** (`custom_components/evon/`) - Python-based HA custom component

## Documentation Structure

**IMPORTANT**: When updating documentation, put content in the correct file based on audience:

| File | Audience | Content |
|------|----------|---------|
| **README.md** | End users | Installation, features, configuration, platform descriptions (user-friendly, no internal details), version history |
| **DEVELOPMENT.md** | Developers | Architecture, API reference, device classes, methods, code patterns, testing, MCP server setup |
| **AGENTS.md** | AI agents | Critical API knowledge, debugging tips, gotchas, implementation patterns, version history (detailed) |

### What Goes Where

| Content Type | File |
|--------------|------|
| How to install/configure | README.md |
| What features are supported | README.md |
| API endpoints and methods | DEVELOPMENT.md |
| Internal property values (e.g., ModeSaved) | DEVELOPMENT.md, AGENTS.md |
| Password encoding details | DEVELOPMENT.md |
| Debugging tips and gotchas | AGENTS.md |
| Code patterns and examples | DEVELOPMENT.md, AGENTS.md |
| MCP tools/resources tables | DEVELOPMENT.md |
| Version history (brief) | README.md |
| Version history (detailed) | AGENTS.md |

### Guidelines

1. **README.md should be user-friendly** - No internal implementation details, no API property names, no code examples
2. **DEVELOPMENT.md is for developers** - Technical details, API reference, code patterns
3. **AGENTS.md is for AI agents** - Critical knowledge that prevents mistakes, debugging tips, gotchas
4. **Keep formatting consistent** - Use tables for structured data, code blocks for examples
5. **Update version history** - Brief in README.md, detailed in AGENTS.md
6. **Don't duplicate** - Link to other docs instead of copying content

## Remote Access API - CRITICAL

The Evon API supports both local and remote access. **Remote access has different authentication requirements.**

### Connection Types

| Type | Base URL | Use Case |
|------|----------|----------|
| **Local** | `http://{local-ip}` | Direct LAN connection (faster, recommended) |
| **Remote** | `https://my.evon-smarthome.com` | Internet access via relay server |

### Remote Login - IMPORTANT DIFFERENCES

**Local login:**
```
POST http://{local-ip}/login
Headers:
  x-elocs-username: <username>
  x-elocs-password: <encoded-password>
```

**Remote login:**
```
POST https://my.evon-smarthome.com/login   ← Note: /login at ROOT, NOT /{engine-id}/login
Headers:
  x-elocs-username: <username>
  x-elocs-password: <encoded-password>
  x-elocs-relayid: <engine-id>              ← REQUIRED for remote
  x-elocs-sessionlogin: true                ← REQUIRED for remote
  X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest          ← REQUIRED for remote
```

**Critical gotcha:** The remote login URL is `https://my.evon-smarthome.com/login` (at root), NOT `https://my.evon-smarthome.com/{engine-id}/login`. The engine ID goes in the `x-elocs-relayid` header only.

### Remote API Calls

After login, API calls use different base URLs:

| Type | API Base URL |
|------|--------------|
| Local | `http://{local-ip}/api/instances/...` |
| Remote | `https://my.evon-smarthome.com/{engine-id}/api/instances/...` |

The actual API methods (get instances, turn on/off, etc.) are identical - the relay server proxies requests to the local Evon system.

### Engine ID

The Engine ID is found in your Evon system settings. It identifies your installation on the relay server (e.g., `985315`).

## Critical API Knowledge

### Brightness Control - IMPORTANT

**DO NOT use `BrightnessSetInternal`** - this sets an internal value but does not change the physical light brightness.

**USE `BrightnessSetScaled`** (canonical name) - this is the correct method that controls the actual physical brightness. The HTTP fallback translates this to `AmznSetBrightness` automatically.

Similarly, when **reading** brightness:
- `Brightness` property = internal value (incorrect)
- `ScaledBrightness` property = actual physical brightness (correct)

### Blind Control Methods - CRITICAL

**Movement methods:**
- **USE `Open`** - moves blind up (opens)
- **USE `Close`** - moves blind down (closes)
- **USE `Stop`** - stops movement
- **DO NOT use `MoveUp` or `MoveDown`** - these methods DO NOT EXIST and will return 404

**Position control:**
- **USE `SetPosition`** (canonical name) - sets blind position (0-100). The HTTP fallback translates this to `AmznSetPercentage` automatically.
- **USE `SetAngle`** - sets tilt angle (0-100)

Position convention in Evon:
- `0` = fully open (blind up)
- `100` = fully closed (blind down)

Note: Home Assistant uses the inverse (0=closed, 100=open), so conversion is needed.

### Climate Control - Three Distinct Concepts

**IMPORTANT**: Climate control involves THREE separate concepts that must not be confused:

| Concept | Name in HA | Scope | Writable | API Property |
|---------|------------|-------|----------|--------------|
| **Season Mode** | `select` entity | Whole house | Yes | `Base.ehThermostat.IsCool` |
| **Preset** | `preset_mode` | Per room | Yes | `ModeSaved` / `MainState` |
| **Climate Status** | `hvac_action` | Per room | **No** | Read-only |

---

### Season Mode (Global Heating/Cooling) - VERIFIED

The **Season Mode** controls whether the entire house is in heating (winter) or cooling (summer) mode.

**API Endpoint:**
```
PUT /api/instances/Base.ehThermostat/IsCool
Content-Type: application/json
Body: {"value": false}  // HEATING (winter)
Body: {"value": true}   // COOLING (summer)
```

**Reading current state:**
```
GET /api/instances/Base.ehThermostat
→ IsCool: false = heating, true = cooling
```

**How it works:**
1. Setting `IsCool` switches ALL climate devices simultaneously
2. Each device's `CoolingMode` property reflects the global setting
3. Changes propagate immediately
4. **Preset values change** when season mode changes (see below)

---

### Preset (Per-Room Temperature Mode)

Each room can be set to one of three presets: **comfort**, **eco**, or **away**.

These preset names match Home Assistant's built-in presets for better UI icons. The actual behavior depends on the current Season Mode.

**CRITICAL**: Preset values in `ModeSaved` differ based on Season Mode!

| Preset | HEATING Mode | COOLING Mode | Description |
|--------|--------------|--------------|-------------|
| **comfort** | `4` | `7` | Normal comfortable temperature |
| **eco** | `3` | `6` | Energy saving (slightly less comfortable) |
| **away** | `2` | `5` | Protection mode (see below) |

**Temperature targets by preset:**
| Preset | Heating (Winter) | Cooling (Summer) |
|--------|------------------|------------------|
| comfort | 24°C | 25.5°C |
| eco | 22.5°C | 24.9°C |
| away | 18°C | 29°C |

**About the `away` preset:**
The `away` preset provides protection appropriate to the current season:
- **Heating mode**: Freeze protection - maintains minimum 18°C to prevent pipes from freezing
- **Cooling mode**: Heat protection - maintains maximum 29°C to prevent overheating

This is the same preset in both seasons, but Evon automatically adjusts its behavior based on what protection is needed.

**API - Setting presets** (works in both modes):
- `WriteDayMode` → sets comfort
- `WriteNightMode` → sets eco
- `WriteFreezeMode` → sets away/protection

**API - Reading preset:**
```python
# Check ModeSaved first, fall back to MainState
mode_saved = details.get("ModeSaved", details.get("MainState", 4))

# Map to preset name (must account for season mode!)
if is_cooling_mode:
    preset_map = {5: "away", 6: "eco", 7: "comfort"}
else:
    preset_map = {2: "away", 3: "eco", 4: "comfort"}
```

**Device type differences:**
| Device Type | Class Name | Preset Property |
|-------------|------------|-----------------|
| ClimateControlUniversal | Contains `ClimateControlUniversal` | `ModeSaved` |
| ClimateControl/Thermostat | `SmartCOM.Clima.ClimateControl` | `MainState` |

---

### Climate Status (Per-Room Activity) - READ-ONLY

The **Climate Status** indicates what the room's climate system is currently doing. This is **read-only** and cannot be changed directly.

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `heating` | Actively heating the room |
| `cooling` | Actively cooling the room |
| `idle` | Target temperature reached, not actively heating/cooling |

**Note**: The exact API property for reading this status needs verification. It may be derived from valve state or a dedicated property.

### Bathroom Radiators - TOGGLE CONTROL

Bathroom radiators (`Heating.BathroomRadiator`) are electric heaters with timer functionality:

1. **Control method**: Use `Switch` method to toggle on/off
2. **No separate on/off methods**: Only toggle is available
3. **Timer-based**: When turned on, runs for `EnableForMins` duration (default 30 minutes)
4. **State properties**:
   - `Output` - current on/off state
   - `NextSwitchPoint` - minutes remaining until auto-off
   - `EnableForMins` - configured duration

```javascript
// Toggle bathroom radiator
await callMethod("BathroomRadiator1", "Switch");
```

### Home State Control - SIMPLE AND RELIABLE

The `System.HomeState` class controls home-wide modes. Key points:

1. **Finding states**: Filter by `ClassName === "System.HomeState"` and skip IDs starting with `System.`
2. **Reading active state**: Check the `Active` property on each state instance
3. **Changing state**: Call `Activate` method on the desired state instance
4. **State IDs are fixed**: `HomeStateAtHome`, `HomeStateHoliday`, `HomeStateNight`, `HomeStateWork`

```javascript
// Example: Switch to night mode
await callMethod("HomeStateNight", "Activate");
```

### Physical Buttons (SmartCOM.Switch) - WebSocket Event Entities

Physical wall buttons (`SmartCOM.Switch` class) are exposed as **HA event entities** with press type detection:

1. **WebSocket events**: Buttons fire `ValuesChanged` events with `IsOn` property (`True` on press, `False` on release)
2. **Press type detection**: The standalone `ButtonPressDetector` class (`coordinator/button_press.py`) detects single press, double press, and long press based on timing
3. **WebSocket-only**: No HTTP polling fallback — buttons only work when WebSocket is connected
4. **Configurable double-click delay**: Users can adjust the detection window (0.2–1.4s, default 0.8s) via integration options

**What this means for agents:**
- Button entities are created by `EvonButtonEvent` in `event.py` with `_entity_type = ENTITY_TYPE_BUTTON_EVENTS`
- The processor (`process_button_events`) creates entities from the `/instances` list — no HTTP detail fetch needed
- `ButtonPressDetector` is a standalone class with no HA dependencies, initialized lazily via `_get_button_detector()`
- The detector uses `on_press`, `schedule_timer`, and `on_timeout` callbacks for decoupled integration
- Press detection flows: coordinator `_handle_button_press()` → detector → `_fire_button_event()` (on_press) / `_button_press_timeout()` (on_timeout)
- Bus event `evon_button_press` is fired with `device_id`, `name`, and `press_type`
- Device triggers are available for automation (single/double/long press per button)
- `SmartCOM.Light.Light` (relay outputs) are now exposed as HA light entities with `ColorMode.ONOFF` (not switches)

**Testing confirmed (February 2026):**
- Button instances fire WebSocket events reliably
- Single press ~190ms, double press detection within configurable delay window (default 0.8s), long press >1.5s
- The Evon controller sends 4 different WS patterns for double-press: `True,True,False` (coalesced release), `True,False,False` (coalesced press), `True,False,True,False` (standard 4-event), and `False,True,False` (swallowed first True — controller drops the first press-down). All 4 patterns are handled by the detector.

### Method Naming Convention

The codebase uses **WS-native method names as canonical names** everywhere. The HTTP API uses "Amzn"-prefixed equivalents, but the translation is handled automatically by `get_http_method_name()` (Python) and `CANONICAL_TO_HTTP_METHOD` (TypeScript).

| Canonical (WS-native) | HTTP API Equivalent | Used For |
|---|---|---|
| `SwitchOn` | `AmznTurnOn` | Lights |
| `SwitchOff` | `AmznTurnOff` | Lights |
| `BrightnessSetScaled` | `AmznSetBrightness` | Light brightness |
| `SetPosition` | `AmznSetPercentage` | Blind position |
| `SetAngle` | `SetAngle` | Blind tilt |

Relay outputs (`SmartCOM.Light.Light`) are now light entities and use the same `SwitchOn`/`SwitchOff` WS control as dimmable lights.

## WebSocket Control - CRITICAL FINDINGS (January 2026)

The integration now supports WebSocket-based device control for faster, more responsive operation. **However, there are important traps to avoid.**

### What Works via WebSocket

| Device | Method | WebSocket Call | Notes |
|--------|--------|----------------|-------|
| Light On | `SwitchOn` | `CallMethod [instanceId.SwitchOn, []]` | ✅ Explicit on - PREFERRED |
| Light Off | `SwitchOff` | `CallMethod [instanceId.SwitchOff, []]` | ✅ Explicit off - PREFERRED |
| Light Brightness | `BrightnessSetScaled` | `CallMethod [instanceId.BrightnessSetScaled, [brightness, transition]]` | ✅ transition=0 for instant |
| Blind Open/Close/Stop | `Open/Close/Stop` | `CallMethod [instanceId.Open, []]` | ✅ Verified |
| Blind Position+Tilt | `MoveToPosition` | `CallMethod [instanceId.MoveToPosition, [angle, position]]` | ✅ Angle comes FIRST! |
| Climate Temperature | `WriteCurrentSetTemperature` | `CallMethod [instanceId.WriteCurrentSetTemperature, [value]]` | ✅ Verified working |
| Climate Comfort | `WriteDayMode` | `CallMethod [instanceId.WriteDayMode, []]` | ✅ Verified working |
| Climate Eco | `WriteNightMode` | `CallMethod [instanceId.WriteNightMode, []]` | ✅ Verified working |
| Climate Away | `WriteFreezeMode` | `CallMethod [instanceId.WriteFreezeMode, []]` | ✅ Verified working |
| Season Mode | `IsCool` | `SetValue [Base.ehThermostat, "IsCool", bool]` | ✅ true=cooling, false=heating |

### What Does NOT Work via WebSocket

| Device | Trap | What Happens |
|--------|------|--------------|
| **Switch** | `SetValue` or `CallMethod` | Returns success but hardware doesn't respond |
| **Blind Position** | `SetValue Position` | Updates UI value but hardware doesn't move, then reverts |
| **Light** | `CallMethod AmznTurnOn/Off` | Returns success but hardware doesn't respond |
| **Light** | `Switch([true/false])` | Inconsistent - may toggle instead of set state on some devices |

### TRAP #1: CallMethod Format

**WRONG format (looks correct but doesn't trigger hardware):**
```json
{"args": ["SC1_M09.Blind2", "Open", []], "methodName": "CallMethod"}
```

**CORRECT format (method appended to instance ID with dot):**
```json
{"args": ["SC1_M09.Blind2.Open", []], "methodName": "CallMethod"}
```

### TRAP #2: Light Control Methods - Use SwitchOn/SwitchOff

The Evon webapp exposes multiple light control methods, but only some work reliably:

**WRONG (inconsistent behavior, may toggle instead of setting state):**
```json
{"args": ["SC1_M01.Light3.Switch", [true]], "methodName": "CallMethod"}
```

**WRONG (doesn't trigger hardware via WebSocket):**
```json
{"args": ["SC1_M01.Light3.AmznTurnOn", []], "methodName": "CallMethod"}
```

**CORRECT (explicit on/off, no ambiguity):**
```json
{"args": ["SC1_M01.Light3.SwitchOn", []], "methodName": "CallMethod"}
{"args": ["SC1_M01.Light3.SwitchOff", []], "methodName": "CallMethod"}
{"args": ["SC1_M01.Light3.BrightnessSetScaled", [75, 0]], "methodName": "CallMethod"}
```

### TRAP #3: Blind MoveToPosition Parameters

**IMPORTANT: Angle comes FIRST, then position!**
```json
{"args": ["SC1_M09.Blind2.MoveToPosition", [angle, position]], "methodName": "CallMethod"}
```

The integration caches angle and position separately so:
- Position changes → `MoveToPosition([cached_angle, new_position])`
- Tilt changes → `MoveToPosition([new_angle, cached_position])`

### Note #4: Relay Output Control

Relay outputs (`SmartCOM.Light.Light`) are now exposed as **light entities** with `ColorMode.ONOFF` (no dimming). They use `SwitchOn`/`SwitchOff` via WebSocket CallMethod, same as dimmable lights. HTTP fallback translates to `AmznTurnOn`/`AmznTurnOff`.

**Important naming distinction:** `SmartCOM.Switch` is NOT a relay — it's the Evon class for physical wall buttons (Tasters), exposed as event entities. Relay outputs use class `SmartCOM.Light.Light` and appear as on/off lights in HA.
```
// WebSocket (preferred):
CallMethod instanceId.SwitchOn([])
// HTTP fallback:
POST /api/instances/{relay_id}/AmznTurnOn
```

### TRAP #5: Non-Dimmable Lights in Light Groups

When a non-dimmable light (e.g., Evon relay controlling power for a combined light with Govee) is part of a light group:
- Brightness changes trigger `turn_on()` on all group members
- The non-dimmable light receives `turn_on()` WITHOUT brightness parameter
- The integration skips the API call if the light is already on (avoids unnecessary traffic)

This is handled automatically in `light.py` - non-dimmable lights that are already on will not receive WebSocket commands when brightness changes on the group.

### Implementation Details

The codebase uses WS-native names as canonical method names everywhere. When the HTTP fallback is needed, `ws_control.get_http_method_name()` (Python) or `CANONICAL_TO_HTTP_METHOD` (TypeScript) translates them to HTTP names automatically.

See `custom_components/evon/ws_control.py` for the mapping configuration and `api.py` for the `_try_ws_control()` method that handles WebSocket-first control with HTTP fallback.

Tests documenting these findings are in `tests/test_ws_client.py` under `TestWebSocketControlFindings`.

## Testing Changes

### MCP Server
```bash
npm run build
# Restart Claude Code to reload the MCP server
```

### Home Assistant Integration
```bash
# Run unit tests — Python 3.14 required (the HA 2026.x test harness needs it)
python3.14 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements-test.txt
pytest
```

For live testing, use the deploy scripts (see Deploy Workflow below).

## Deploy Workflow (Home Assistant Integration)

SSH access to Home Assistant enables quick deployment and log checking.

### Initial Setup

1. **Copy `.env.example` to `.env`** and fill in your values:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your HA IP and user
   ```

2. **Configure SSH on Home Assistant:**
   - Install "Terminal & SSH" add-on
   - Add your public key to authorized_keys in the add-on configuration
   - Start the add-on

3. **Verify connection:**
   ```bash
   ssh root@192.168.1.x  # Replace with your HA IP
   ```

### Deploy Scripts

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `./scripts/ha-deploy.sh` | Deploy integration to HA |
| `./scripts/ha-deploy.sh restart` | Deploy and restart HA |
| `./scripts/ha-logs.sh` | Fetch evon-related logs (last 100 lines) |
| `./scripts/ha-logs.sh 50` | Fetch last 50 lines |
| `./scripts/ha-logs.sh 100 error` | Fetch lines containing "error" |

### Typical Development Session

```bash
# 1. Make code changes
# ... edit files in custom_components/evon/

# 2. Deploy to HA
./scripts/ha-deploy.sh

# 3. Reload integration in HA UI (or restart HA)
# Settings → Devices & Services → Evon → ⋮ → Reload

# 4. Check logs for errors
./scripts/ha-logs.sh

# 5. Run linting before committing
ruff check custom_components/evon/ && ruff format custom_components/evon/
```

### Security Notes

- **`.env` is in `.gitignore`** - credentials are never committed
- **Never hardcode IP addresses or credentials** in scripts
- The `.env.example` file shows required variables without actual values

## Using Evon MCP Server for Debugging

The Evon MCP server can be used to directly query the Evon API for debugging and verification. This is useful for:
- **Discovering properties**: See all available properties on a device instance
- **Verifying HA changes**: Check if changes made in Home Assistant are reflected in Evon
- **Debugging issues**: Compare what HA shows vs what Evon actually reports
- **Testing API methods**: Call methods directly to understand their behavior

### MCP Server Configuration

The Evon MCP server is configured in `.claude.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "evon": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/evon-ha/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "EVON_HOST": "http://192.168.x.x",
        "EVON_USERNAME": "<username>",
        "EVON_PASSWORD": "<password>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Useful MCP Tools for Debugging

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `get_instance` | Get all properties of a specific device instance |
| `get_property` | Get a specific property value |
| `call_method` | Call any method on an instance to test behavior |
| `list_climate` | List all climate devices with current state |
| `list_lights` | List all lights with current state |

### Direct API Queries via Bash

If the MCP server is not available, you can query the Evon API directly:

```bash
# Generate password hash
PASS_HASH=$(node -e "
const crypto = require('crypto');
const hash = crypto.createHash('sha512').update('username' + 'password').digest('base64');
console.log(hash);
")

# Login and get token
TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST "http://192.168.x.x/login" \
  -H "x-elocs-username: username" \
  -H "x-elocs-password: $PASS_HASH" \
  -D - 2>/dev/null | grep -i "x-elocs-token" | cut -d' ' -f2 | tr -d '\r\n')

# Query an instance (e.g., climate device)
curl -s "http://192.168.x.x/api/instances/ClimateControlUniversal1" \
  -H "Cookie: token=$TOKEN" | python3 -m json.tool
```

### Example: Debugging Climate Preset Mode

When investigating why climate preset wasn't showing correctly:

1. **Query the device** to see all properties:
   ```
   get_instance instance_id=ClimateControlUniversal1
   ```

2. **Look for relevant properties**:
   - `Mode` - Found to be 0 for all presets (heating/cooling mode, NOT preset!)
   - `ModeSaved` - Found to change: 2=away, 3=eco, 4=comfort (in heating mode)

3. **Test by changing preset in Evon** and re-querying to see which property changes

4. **Verify HA integration** correctly reads the identified property

This approach helped discover that `ModeSaved` (not `Mode`) indicates the preset mode.

## Device Class Names

When filtering devices from the API, use these class names:

| Device | Class Name | Controllable |
|--------|------------|--------------|
| Dimmable Lights | `SmartCOM.Light.LightDim` | Yes |
| Relay Outputs (On/Off Lights) | `SmartCOM.Light.Light` | Yes |
| RGBW Lights | `SmartCOM.Light.DynamicRGBWLight` | Yes |
| Light Groups | `SmartCOM.Light.LightGroup` | Yes |
| Blinds | `SmartCOM.Blind.Blind` | Yes |
| Blind Groups | `SmartCOM.Blind.BlindGroup` | Yes |
| Climate | `SmartCOM.Clima.ClimateControl` | Yes |
| Climate (universal) | Contains `ClimateControlUniversal` | Yes |
| Bathroom Radiator | `Heating.BathroomRadiator` | Yes (use `Switch` method to toggle) |
| Home State | `System.HomeState` | Yes (use `Activate` method) |
| Scene | `System.SceneApp` | Yes (use `Execute` method) |
| Physical Buttons | `SmartCOM.Switch` | No (event entity, WS-only) |
| Smart Meter | Contains `Energy.SmartMeter` | No (sensor only) |
| Security Door | `Security.Door` | No (sensor only, stores SavedPictures) |
| Intercom (2N) | `Security.Intercom.2N.Intercom2N` | No (sensor only) |
| Camera (2N) | `Security.Intercom.2N.Intercom2NCam` | Yes (trigger image capture) |

### Smart Meter Energy Sensors - IMPORTANT

Evon smart meters expose two energy values:

| Sensor | Evon Property | Description | HA Energy Dashboard |
|--------|---------------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Energy Total** | `Energy` | Cumulative total, always increasing | ✅ **Use this** |
| **Energy (24h Rolling)** | `Energy24h` | Rolling 24-hour window | ❌ Don't use |

**CRITICAL**: The `Energy24h` property is a **rolling 24-hour window**, not a daily reset. It can **decrease** during the day as high-consumption hours from yesterday roll off. Using this in HA's Energy Dashboard will produce **negative values**.

Always configure HA's Energy Dashboard to use `sensor.*_energy_total` instead.

| Air Quality | `System.Location.AirQuality` | No (sensor only, CO2=-999 means no sensor) |
| Climate Valve | `SmartCOM.Clima.Valve` | No (sensor only) |
| Room/Area | `System.Location.Room` | No (used for area sync) |

## API Authentication Flow

1. POST to `/login` with headers `x-elocs-username` and `x-elocs-password`
2. Get token from response header `x-elocs-token`
3. Use token in cookie for all subsequent requests: `Cookie: token=<token>`
4. On 302 or 401 response, re-authenticate and retry

## Security Implementation

The API client implements several security measures:

### SSL/TLS
- Explicit SSL context using `ssl.create_default_context()` for all HTTPS connections
- System certificate store used for verification
- Applied via `aiohttp.TCPConnector` for remote connections
- Connection limits: 10 total, 5 per host

### Credential Protection
- Sensitive headers redacted from debug logs (`x-elocs-token`, `x-elocs-password`, `cookie`, etc.)
- Password hashed client-side before transmission (SHA-512 of username+password, Base64 encoded)
- No credentials in error messages or exceptions
- Engine ID redacted in diagnostics export — including `entry.title` (which embeds the host or Engine ID), not just `data`/`options`
- Login redirect URLs sanitized in logs (only path shown)

### Input Validation
- Instance IDs validated against pattern `^[a-zA-Z0-9._-]+$` (prevents path traversal)
- Method names validated against pattern `^[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9]*$`
- Engine ID validated: 4-12 alphanumeric characters (validated in both config flow and API)
- Username must be non-empty (whitespace stripped)
- Password must be non-empty
- Host port validated: 1-65535

### Token Management
- Token TTL tracking (1 hour default)
- Automatic refresh when expired
- `asyncio.Lock` prevents race conditions in concurrent token access
- Token cleared on 401/302 responses with retry
- Token cleared from memory on session close

### HTTP Security
- Content-Type validation - raises error if response is not JSON
- Specific error handling for 400 (bad request), 403 (forbidden), 404, 429 (rate limit), 5xx errors
- Response reason included in all error messages for debugging
- Accepts 200, 201, 204 as success codes
- Unexpected redirects rejected (not logged with full URL)
- Session creation error handling

### Camera Recordings
- Served through an authenticated `HomeAssistantView` (`recordings_view.py`, `requires_auth=True`) at `/evon/recordings/{filename}`, **not** a static path. Static paths registered via `async_register_static_paths` bypass HA auth (like `www/`), which would let anyone who can reach the HA HTTP port download footage — including over a Nabu Casa remote URL or reverse proxy.
- The Lovelace card plays recordings inline via `auth/sign_path` signed URLs, which the authenticated view validates; the media browser (`media_source`) is likewise auth-gated.
- Filenames are validated (no `/`, `\`, or dot-segments) and the resolved path is confined to the recordings directory before serving.

## Optimistic Updates

All controllable entities implement optimistic updates to prevent UI flicker when changing state. When a user triggers an action (turn on light, change preset, etc.), the UI immediately shows the expected state without waiting for the coordinator to poll Evon.

**How it works (v1.22+):**
1. User triggers action (e.g., turn on light)
2. Entity sets optimistic state, records `_optimistic_state_set_at`, calls `async_write_ha_state()`
3. API call is made to Evon (WS preferred, HTTP fallback)
4. Entity calls `self._schedule_post_command_recheck()` — arms a 5s `async_call_later` that will call `coordinator.async_request_refresh()` if no WS event arrives. Replaces the v1.21 pattern of an immediate refresh after every command.
5. WS event for this entity arrives: `_cancel_post_command_recheck_if_data_changed()` cancels the pending recheck (WS is alive — no manual poll needed). Cancellation keys off the coordinator's per-entity WS-update timestamp advancing, **not** dict identity — so a stale in-flight HTTP poll rebuilding the entity dict during the quiesce window does not defeat the recheck safety net (RV-D1). Selects override the snapshot/compare to use their coordinator state value.
6. In `_handle_coordinator_update()`: the comparison-clear logic runs ALWAYS (even during quiesce) — optimistic is cleared when actual matches expected. The `POST_COMMAND_QUIESCE_PERIOD` (5s) only gates whether `super().async_write_ha_state()` runs, suppressing attribute flicker during fade animations.
7. Backstop: `OPTIMISTIC_STATE_TIMEOUT` (30s) clears stuck optimistic state if neither a confirming WS event nor the recheck ever resolves it.

**Entities with optimistic updates:**
| Entity | Optimistic Properties |
|--------|----------------------|
| Light | `is_on`, `brightness`, `color_temp` |
| Cover | `position`, `tilt_position`, `is_moving` |
| Climate | `preset_mode`, `target_temperature`, `hvac_mode` |
| Switch | `is_on` |
| Bathroom Radiator | `is_on`, `time_remaining_mins` |
| Home State Select | `current_option` |
| Season Mode Select | `current_option` |

**Implementation pattern:**
```python
# In __init__
self._optimistic_is_on: bool | None = None

# In property
@property
def is_on(self) -> bool:
    if self._optimistic_is_on is not None:
        return self._optimistic_is_on
    # ... get from coordinator

# In action method
async def async_turn_on(self, **kwargs):
    self._optimistic_is_on = True
    self._set_optimistic_timestamp()
    self.async_write_ha_state()
    await self._api.turn_on(...)
    self._schedule_post_command_recheck()  # 5s self-healing fallback

# In coordinator update handler
def _handle_coordinator_update(self):
    self._cancel_post_command_recheck_if_data_changed()

    # Comparison-clear ALWAYS runs (so matching WS clears optimistic ASAP)
    if self._optimistic_is_on is not None:
        actual = self.coordinator.get_entity_data(...)
        if actual == self._optimistic_is_on:
            self._optimistic_is_on = None
            self._optimistic_state_set_at = None

    # Suppress async_write_ha_state only while optimistic is still active
    # (prevents attribute flicker during Evon's fade animation).
    if (
        self._optimistic_state_set_at is not None
        and time.monotonic() - self._optimistic_state_set_at < POST_COMMAND_QUIESCE_PERIOD
    ):
        return
    super()._handle_coordinator_update()

# In async_will_remove_from_hass
async def async_will_remove_from_hass(self):
    self._cleanup_post_command_recheck()
    await super().async_will_remove_from_hass()
```

**Select entity override:** `EvonHomeStateSelect` and `EvonSeasonModeSelect` read state from `coordinator.get_active_home_state()` / `get_season_mode()` rather than `_get_data()`. They override `_recheck_snapshot()` and `_recheck_data_changed()` on `EvonEntity` so the cancel-on-WS mechanism uses value equality against the right coordinator method. Selects don't apply the quiesce drop — they have no animation.

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Empty device names**: Skip instances where `Name` is empty - these are templates/base classes
2. **Token expiry**: Tokens expire; implement retry logic with re-authentication
3. **Brightness values**: Evon uses 0-100, Home Assistant uses 0-255 — convert with `round()` in both directions for consistency. Minimum brightness is clamped to 1% (Evon) to prevent HA brightness=1 mapping to 0%.
4. **Position inversion**: Evon and HA have opposite conventions for cover position

## Architecture Decisions (Do Not Change)

These are intentional design choices. Do NOT flag them as bugs or attempt to "fix" them during code reviews:

1. **Scenes not in `CLASS_TO_TYPE` (ws_mappings.py)**: `EVON_CLASS_SCENE` is intentionally omitted. Scenes are fire-and-forget button entities (`button.py`) with no observable state — they don't need WebSocket subscriptions.

2. **HVAC COOL and HEAT both call comfort mode (climate.py)**: Correct behavior. The heating/cooling distinction is controlled by the global Season Mode (per-system `Base.ehThermostat.IsCool`), not per-room HVAC mode. Setting any non-OFF mode restores the comfort preset.

3. **`ENTITY_TYPE_SWITCHES` entries in `SUBSCRIBE_PROPERTIES`/`PROPERTY_MAPPINGS` (ws_mappings.py)**: Retained for future switch classes but currently unreachable — no class in `CLASS_TO_TYPE` maps to this entity type. `Base.bSwitch` sub-instances (intercom door relays, template objects) are silently skipped by `get_entity_type()` — they were never processed into entities even when mapped. `SmartCOM.Light.Light` relay outputs are on the light platform.

4. **Duplicate WebSocket status sensors (binary_sensor.py + sensor.py)**: Intentional — the binary sensor provides simple on/off for automations, while the text sensor provides rich diagnostics (uptime, latency, reconnect count). Both serve different use cases.

5. **`energy_today` treating missing data as 0 kWh (coordinator)**: Intentional. Changing this would alter behavior for existing users' energy dashboards. The current behavior is the safer default.

6. **`_sequence_id` growing unbounded (ws_client.py)**: Safe. Python handles arbitrary-precision integers. The counter resets to 1 on every reconnect. Only relevant for connections lasting months without a single reconnect — unrealistic.

7. **Quiesce drop not on all entity types**: The `POST_COMMAND_QUIESCE_PERIOD` early-return that suppresses `async_write_ha_state` is applied to lights, switches, climate, and covers — entities where intermediate WebSocket states cause visible UI flicker. Selects participate in the scheduled-recheck mechanism (via their `_recheck_snapshot` override) but skip the drop — they have no animation. Binary sensors and event entities don't need either because they have no optimistic state.

8. **`cover.py` uses `asyncio.sleep(COVER_STOP_DELAY)` inline**: Intentional 0.3s anti-flicker delay for toggle-style blind control. The `if self.hass is not None` guard after sleep is sufficient — the sleep is too short for CancelledError to be a practical concern.

9. **`_extract_instance_id_from_unique_id` is a 123-line reverse parser (__init__.py)**: Intentional — changing the unique_id format would break existing installations. The function handles all known formats correctly.

10. **Login logic duplicated between `EvonApi.login()` and `EvonWsClient._login()`**: The two paths have subtle differences (WS accepts token on 302 redirect, different header handling for remote connections). Unifying them risks breaking authentication.

11. **Climate substring match `EVON_CLASS_CLIMATE_UNIVERSAL not in class_name`**: Intentionally lenient to handle potential Evon subclass variants (e.g., `Heating.ClimateControlUniversal.V2`).

12. **Source-inspection tests using `ast.parse()` (test_processors.py)**: Camera/recorder code can't be imported in the test environment due to missing HA dependencies. Source inspection is the accepted tradeoff.

## Environment Variables (MCP Server)

Configure via Claude Code's `~/.claude.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "evon": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/evon-ha/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "EVON_HOST": "http://192.168.x.x",
        "EVON_USERNAME": "<username>",
        "EVON_PASSWORD": "<password>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Required variables:**
- `EVON_HOST` - Evon system URL (your local IP)
- `EVON_USERNAME` - Your Evon username
- `EVON_PASSWORD` - Plain text OR encoded password (auto-detected)

**Security**: `.claude.json` is in `.gitignore` - never commit credentials.

## Password Encoding

The Evon API requires `x-elocs-password` which is NOT plain text. The encoding is:

```
x-elocs-password = Base64(SHA512(username + password))
```

**Both integrations now handle this automatically:**
- MCP Server: Auto-detects if password is already encoded (88 chars ending with `==`)
- Home Assistant: Encodes plain text password in the `EvonApi` class

**To manually encode (if needed):**
```python
import hashlib, base64
encoded = base64.b64encode(hashlib.sha512((username + password).encode()).digest()).decode()
```

## Adding New Device Types

1. Find the device class name in `/api/instances` response
2. Add class name constant to `const.py`
3. Create a processor in `coordinator/processors/` (e.g., `new_device.py`)
4. Export processor from `coordinator/processors/__init__.py`
5. Call processor in `coordinator/__init__.py` `_async_update_data()`
6. Set `_entity_type` class attribute and use `_get_data()` in entity
7. Create new platform file (e.g., `sensor.py`)
8. Add platform to `PLATFORMS` list in `__init__.py`
9. Add tests in `tests/test_new_device.py`
10. Update `manifest.json` if needed

### Python (ruff)
```bash
# Check for linting issues
ruff check custom_components/evon/

# Auto-fix linting issues
ruff check custom_components/evon/ --fix

# Check formatting (what CI runs)
ruff format --check custom_components/evon/

# Auto-fix formatting
ruff format custom_components/evon/
```

### TypeScript (eslint)
```bash
# Check for issues
npm run lint

# Auto-fix issues
npm run lint:fix
```

### Quick CI Check (run before committing)
```bash
ruff check custom_components/evon/ tests/ && ruff format --check custom_components/evon/ tests/ && npm run lint
```

### Test Architecture

**CI runs both linting and pytest.** Tests that require homeassistant use `requires_ha_test_framework` skip markers and are skipped in environments without HA installed.

Tests are split by dependency:
| Test File | Requires HA | How It Works |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| `test_api.py` | No | Mocks `homeassistant` module, uses `importlib` to load `api.py` directly |
| `test_*_unit.py` | No | Unit tests that mock all HA dependencies |
| `test_config_flow.py` | Yes | Uses `requires_ha_test_framework` skip marker |
| `test_coordinator.py` | Yes | Uses `requires_ha_test_framework` skip marker |

**Why this matters for agents:**
- When importing from `custom_components.evon.*`, Python executes `__init__.py` which imports from `homeassistant`
- To test without HA, mock the homeassistant module before importing (like `test_api.py` and the `*_unit.py` tests)

### Running Tests

```bash
# Install test dependencies (Python 3.14 required — an older interpreter fails with
# "No matching distribution found for pytest-homeassistant-custom-component")
pip install -r requirements-test.txt

# Run all tests (HA-dependent tests will be skipped if HA not installed)
pytest

# Run with verbose output
pytest -v
```

### CI Checks

The CI workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs:
1. `ruff check` - Python linting (custom_components/evon/ and tests/)
2. `ruff format --check` - Python formatting
3. `mypy` - Python type checking
4. `npm run lint` - TypeScript linting
5. `npm run build` - TypeScript compilation
6. `npm run test:mcp` - MCP server tests
7. `npm audit` - npm security audit (fails the build at `--audit-level=high`)
8. `pip-audit` - Python dependency audit (advisory-only; HA hard-pins its deps, so
   findings there are usually not fixable downstream)
9. `pytest` - Python tests (matrix: Python 3.14, Ubuntu + macOS) with Codecov upload
10. HACS validation - Custom component structure check

Additional workflows:
- **CodeQL** (`.github/workflows/codeql.yml`) - Security scanning for Python and JavaScript/TypeScript on push, PRs, and weekly schedule. Results in the repo's Security tab.
- **Renovate** (`renovate.json`) - Automated dependency updates. Runs weekly (Monday, Europe/Vienna). Groups updates by ecosystem (npm deps, npm devDeps, pip, GitHub Actions). Patch updates automerge when CI passes.

**Before committing, always run:**
```bash
ruff check custom_components/evon/ tests/
ruff format custom_components/evon/ tests/
npm run lint
```

## Pre-Commit Checklist

**IMPORTANT**: Before every commit, ensure documentation is updated:

1. **Update ALL documentation files** if the changes affect them:
   - `README.md` - User-facing features, installation, configuration
   - `DEVELOPMENT.md` - Architecture, API reference, code patterns
   - `AGENTS.md` - AI agent guidelines, debugging tips, gotchas
   - `docs/*.md` - Detailed technical documentation (e.g., BLIND_TILT_BEHAVIOR.md)

2. **Run linting** before committing:
   ```bash
   ruff check custom_components/evon/ tests/ && ruff format --check custom_components/evon/ tests/ && npm run lint
   ```

3. **Check for undocumented API discoveries** - Any new properties, methods, or behaviors found during development should be documented.

---

## Release Process

Before creating a release, ensure the following are up to date:

1. **Version numbers** - Update in ALL FOUR files (they must match!):
   - `package.json`
   - `package-lock.json` ← Run `npm install --package-lock-only` to sync
   - `pyproject.toml`
   - `custom_components/evon/manifest.json`

2. **Documentation** - Review and update ALL docs:
   - `README.md` - User-facing documentation, supported devices
   - `DEVELOPMENT.md` - API reference, code patterns
   - `AGENTS.md` - AI guidelines, debugging tips, version history
   - `docs/*.md` - Detailed technical docs

3. **Version history** - Add entry to:
   - `README.md` (brief, user-friendly)
   - `AGENTS.md` (detailed, technical)

4. **Linting** - Run all CI checks:
   ```bash
   ruff check custom_components/evon/ tests/ && ruff format --check custom_components/evon/ tests/ && npm run lint
   ```

5. **Build TypeScript** - Ensure MCP server compiles:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

**Common mistake**: `package.json` version was not updated from v1.4.1 to v1.11.0 across multiple releases. Always check all four version files match!

**Dependency updates**: Renovate is configured to open weekly dependency update PRs (see `renovate.json`). Patch updates automerge when CI passes. Review and merge minor/major update PRs manually.

## Version History

**IMPORTANT**: Before updating version history, always check the existing entries to identify the current/latest version. Do not overwrite an already-released version with new features - create a new version number instead.

- **v1.22.1**: **Remove WS_RECEIVE_TIMEOUT from websocket handling (diagnosis and core fix by Gernot Reisinger in #6; landed with maintainer follow-ups via #10 — #6 itself was closed unmerged).** The 180s `asyncio.timeout` wrapper around each `_ws.receive()` call in `_handle_messages()` false-disconnected healthy-but-quiet systems: aiohttp answers server pings internally and pong frames never surface through `receive()`, so on installations with sparse WS traffic `receive()` legitimately blocks indefinitely. The expiring timeout landed in the `except (aiohttp.ClientError, TimeoutError, OSError)` branch → ERROR log + full disconnect + reconnect every 3 minutes, flapping the `websocket_disconnected` repair notification, resetting the extended poll interval, and failing in-flight commands (the earlier v1.18.0 "relax 90s→180s" change only treated the symptom). Dead-connection detection is the job of `heartbeat=WS_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL` (30s) on `ws_connect` — a dead peer surfaces as an ERROR/CLOSED frame handled with a proper disconnect. Removed the orphaned `WS_RECEIVE_TIMEOUT` constant from `const.py`. Tests: inverted the source-pinning test (now `test_handle_messages_receive_is_not_wrapped_in_timeout`, asserting `receive()` is NOT wrapped); added `test_connect_passes_heartbeat_to_ws_connect` pinning the heartbeat kwarg on `ws_connect` (it is now the sole liveness mechanism); dropped the two `WS_RECEIVE_TIMEOUT == 180` constant-pinning tests; kept the TimeoutError-path test retitled `test_handle_messages_timeout_error_disconnects` (defensive-only — no live aiohttp configuration raises TimeoutError from that try block anymore; pong failure surfaces as a `WSMsgType.ERROR` frame). Synced DEVELOPMENT.md (const listing + stale-request-cleanup note). Release-prep fixes: `@types/node` realigned from ^26 to the Node 24 floor so tsc typechecks against the runtime the package advertises (engines/CI/types match again); dead `[tool.pytest.ini_options]` block removed from pyproject.toml (root `pytest.ini` is authoritative and additionally carries `pythonpath = .`); RELEASING.md release-commit recipe now stages the changelog files; nonexistent `info.md` dropped from doc checklists (`hacs.json` has `render_readme: true`). 1276 tests.
- **v1.22.0**: **Post-command quiesce redesign + coordinator/light fixes + MCP refactor + runtime floor bump (Python 3.14 / Node 24).** (Backfilled from the README row — see README.md Version History for the full narrative.) Command → optimistic state → HTTP recheck replaced with a 5s quiesce window (`POST_COMMAND_QUIESCE_PERIOD`) that any incoming WS event cancels, eliminating post-command bounce-back; climate gained a self-healing recheck fallback; radiator 3s verify timer removed. **Breaking:** minimum HA 2026.5.0 / Python 3.14 / Node 24 LTS; CI now tests against HA 2026.8.0 (the old open floor silently resolved to HA 2025.1.4 under Python 3.12). Security: camera recordings served through an authenticated `HomeAssistantView` instead of an open static path. WS/poll race fixed (WS updates during a slow in-flight poll no longer overwritten). Coordinator uses `async_update_listeners()` for WS events; dimmable lights report `brightness=0` when off; energy-statistics import respects its 1-hour rate limit; WS reconnect applies backoff on handshake failure; repair "Fix" flows moved to `repairs.py`; plus two review passes (RV1/RV2) covering unload teardown, re-auth vs rate-limit at startup, stale-entity cleanup, diagnostics redaction, resubscribe retries, phantom disconnect-repair suppression, and WS-confirmation liveness. Full suite: 1277 tests.
- **v1.21.0**: **HA 2026.3 compatibility, HACS hardening, async & security fixes.** (Backfilled from the README row.) Minimum HA version bumped to 2026.3.0. MCP server covers all 4 HTTP light class types (`SmartCOM.Light.Light`, `LightDim`, `DynamicRGBWLight`, `LightGroup`). SSL context creation moved off the event loop. API client switched to HA-managed session callback. Re-auth failures trigger HA's reauth UI. Repair notifications scoped per config entry and auto-resolved. WebSocket disconnect raises an HA Repair notification. `py.typed` marker added. 3 CodeQL findings resolved. Patched flatted prototype pollution vulnerability (high severity).
- **v1.20.0**: **Expose relay outputs as light entities (breaking change).** `SmartCOM.Light.Light` (L1144/L1244 relay modules) are now exposed as HA light entities with `ColorMode.ONOFF` instead of switch entities. Existing `switch.xxx` entities for relay outputs become `light.xxx` entities. Light processor now includes `EVON_CLASS_LIGHT` in `LIGHT_CLASSES` set and adds `supports_dimming` field to coordinator data (`True` for LightDim/RGBW/LightGroup, `False` for relay-only Light). Light entity `__init__` uses `supports_dimming` from coordinator data combined with `CONF_NON_DIMMABLE_LIGHTS` options to determine `_is_dimmable`. Switch processor now returns empty list (placeholder for future switch classes). WebSocket control and mappings were already correct (mapped `EVON_CLASS_LIGHT` to `ENTITY_TYPE_LIGHTS` and `LIGHT_MAPPINGS`). **Code review fixes (3 commits)**: (1) WebSocket race condition — `_try_ws_control` now captures `self._ws_client` into local variable before use, preventing None dereference during shutdown; removed 4 `# type: ignore[union-attr]` comments. (2) Settling periods — climate and cover entities now use `OPTIMISTIC_SETTLING_PERIOD` to ignore coordinator updates during control actions, matching lights/switches pattern; cover restructured so blind cache always updates first. (3) Brightness rounding — forward conversion `int()` → `round()` at line 157, matching reverse direction; brightness 1 (Evon) now correctly maps to 1% instead of 0%. (4) Select entities — `EvonHomeStateSelect` and `EvonSeasonModeSelect` now call `super()._handle_coordinator_update()` instead of `self.async_write_ha_state()`. (5) Constants cleanup — `CONF_HOST`/`USERNAME`/`PASSWORD` re-exported from `homeassistant.const` via `const.py` (deduplication); hardcoded class strings replaced with named constants (`EVON_CLASS_BLIND_BASE`, `EVON_CLASS_BLIND_EH`, `EVON_CLASS_LIGHT_BASE`). (6) Camera auth retry — `fetch_image` now retries on 302/401 responses. (7) WS client guard — `connect()` returns False if `_password is None` after `stop()`. (8) Config flow — IPv6 host validation support; `raise` in except uses `from None` (B904). (9) Diagnostics — added `ENTITY_TYPE_BUTTON_EVENTS` and `ENTITY_TYPE_HOME_STATES` to entity types and summary fields. (10) Options reload — skips reload when only debug flags changed. (11) Dead code removed — `Base.bSwitch` entries cleaned from `CLASS_CONTROL_MAPPINGS` and `CLASS_TO_TYPE` (confirmed via Evon API: `Base.bSwitch` sub-instances are intercom door relays and template objects, never processed into entities). (12) Docs — added "Architecture Decisions (Do Not Change)" section to AGENTS.md documenting 12 intentional design choices to prevent future false-positive reviews. (13) Non-dimmable lights dropdown — options flow now only shows lights with `supports_dimming: True`, so hardware ONOFF lights (`SmartCOM.Light.Light`) don't appear as candidates for the override. (14) Relay migration — stale entity cleanup now detects old `evon_switch_*` entities whose instance_id moved to the light platform and removes them automatically with an HA Repair notification (`relay_migrated_to_light`) telling users to update automations/dashboards. 1160 tests passing.
- **v1.19.2**: **Fix double-click detection for 4th button pattern.** The Evon controller non-deterministically produces 4 different WS event patterns for double-press. The `False, True, False` pattern (swallowed first True — controller drops the first press-down, delivers only the first release + second press-release) was previously ignored by the orphaned-release handler in `ButtonPressDetector`, causing it to be detected as single_press. Fix: orphaned `False` events (no `press_start`, no `pending_timer`) now always increment `release_count` and schedule a timer, enabling detection of the swallowed-first-True pattern. Confirmed via raw WebSocket capture on hardware — pattern occurs intermittently, more often when the controlled light is off. 1166 tests passing.
- **v1.19.1**: **Fix switch (relay) 401 errors (Issue #1).** Root cause: relay switches (`Base.bSwitch`) were the only entity type forced to HTTP-only control after the v1.17.1 WS-native name refactor — `turn_on_switch`/`turn_off_switch` still used the old `AmznTurnOn`/`AmznTurnOff` names while lights were migrated to `SwitchOn`/`SwitchOff`. Since lights/blinds/climate all use WebSocket for control (bypassing HTTP auth), only switches were exposed to HTTP auth token issues (401s). **Fixes**: (1) Switch API methods updated to use canonical WS-native names (`SwitchOn`/`SwitchOff`); (2) `SWITCH_MAPPINGS` populated with `SwitchOn`/`SwitchOff` WsControlMapping entries — switches now use WebSocket CallMethod same as lights; (3) Removed `SmartCOM.Switch` (physical buttons) from `CLASS_CONTROL_MAPPINGS` — they're event-only entities, not controllable relays; (4) `LOGIN_MAX_BACKOFF` reduced from 300s to 60s — 5 minutes too aggressive for home automation. **Docs**: Clarified relay (`Base.bSwitch`) vs physical button (`SmartCOM.Switch`) naming throughout README, DEVELOPMENT.md, WEBSOCKET_API.md, and AGENTS.md. Updated all outdated "switches must use HTTP" documentation. 1165 tests passing.
- **v1.19.0**: **Physical button (Taster) support with configurable double-click delay.** Wall buttons (`SmartCOM.Switch`) exposed as HA event entities (`EvonButtonEvent`) with press type detection (single_press, double_press, long_press). WebSocket-only — buttons fire `ValuesChanged` events on `IsOn` property. **ButtonPressDetector** (`coordinator/button_press.py`): standalone press detection state machine with no HA dependencies, using `on_press`/`schedule_timer`/`on_timeout` callback pattern for decoupled integration. Initialized lazily via `_get_button_detector()` (needs `hass.loop`). Handles all 4 Evon WS double-press patterns (coalesced release, coalesced press, standard 4-event, swallowed first True). **Configurable double-click delay** (0.2–1.4s, default 0.8s) exposed in options flow under "Physical Buttons" collapsible section (only shown when buttons are detected). Processor (`process_button_events`) filters by `EVON_CLASS_PHYSICAL_BUTTON`, no HTTP detail fetch needed. Device triggers for all three press types per button device. Translations for all 10 languages. Fixed `_async_cleanup_stale_entities()` removing button entities. Also: WS control mappings for blind group commands (OpenAll/CloseAll/StopAll), recorder executor fix for statistics calls. **Code quality**: Removed redundant `unique_id` and `event_types` properties from event entities (HA auto-exposes `_attr_*`), changed button logging from info to debug, fixed double `async_set_updated_data` for immediate long_press, replaced deprecated `asyncio.get_event_loop()` with `asyncio.run()` in tests. 1161 tests total.
- **v1.18.0**: **Auth retry storm fix (Issue #2), WebSocket diagnostics, doorbell event entity, 8 new translations.** Three complementary fixes for the auth retry storm regression (Issue #2) that caused 700+ API requests/min on network errors: (1) `login()` now calls `self._increment_login_backoff()` before raising `EvonConnectionError` on `aiohttp.ClientError`, preventing rapid-fire retries during network outages; (2) re-auth in `_request()` wrapped in try/except catching `EvonAuthError` and `EvonConnectionError`, re-raising as `EvonAuthError` to prevent `token=None` cascades; (3) WS receive timeout relaxed from 90s (3x heartbeat) to 180s (6x heartbeat) to prevent false disconnects on low-traffic systems (the timeout was removed entirely in v1.22.1 — the relax only treated the symptom). **WebSocket metrics**: Added rolling window response time tracking (`deque(maxlen=100)`), reconnect count, message/request counts, uptime, pending request count, last error tracking. First connect vs reconnect distinguished via `_has_connected_once` flag. **Diagnostic sensors**: `EvonWebSocketStatusSensor` (connected/disconnected/disabled state with 7 extra attributes: reconnect_count, messages_received, requests_sent, pending_requests, connection_uptime, last_error, avg_response_time_ms) and `EvonWebSocketLatencySensor` (avg response time in ms, `SensorStateClass.MEASUREMENT` for HA long-term statistics). Both use `EntityCategory.DIAGNOSTIC`. WS status sensor extends `CoordinatorEntity` directly (not `EvonEntity`) since it represents integration state, not an Evon device. **Doorbell event entity**: New `event.py` platform with `EvonDoorbellEvent` class. Extends `EvonEntity` + `EventEntity`, `device_class=DOORBELL`, `event_types=["ring"]`. Unique ID: `evon_doorbell_{instance_id}`. Tracks `_last_doorbell_state` and fires "ring" on False→True transition of `doorbell_triggered` from coordinator data. `Platform.EVENT` added to PLATFORMS list. **Translations**: Added 8 new translation files (fr, it, sl, es, pt, pl, cs, sk) with 223 keys each, matching en.json structure. All UI strings translated: config flow, options flow, services, entities, issues, selectors. **CI/deps**: Bumped GitHub Actions to latest major versions. Test dep cleanup: removed unused `aiohttp` from requirements-test.txt, bumped pytest>=8.3.0, pytest-asyncio>=0.24.0, pytest-cov>=6.0.0, pytest-homeassistant-custom-component>=0.13.0, mypy>=1.15.0. PyTurboJPEG documented as required (HA camera module-level import). Ruff format applied to new files. Redundant `pip install mypy` removed from CI. **Tests**: 876 tests passing (up from 856), 20 new tests covering login backoff, request auth retry, WS timeout, WS metrics, WS sensors, and doorbell events.
- **v1.17.1**: **Code quality audit and hardening (3 rounds).** Three rounds of deep analysis across 4 parallel agents per round. Round 1 identified 35 issues, round 2 found 7, round 3 found 5 — total 24 fixes applied. **Bug fixes (8)**: Light brightness rounding (truncation turned brightness 2 to 0/off, now uses `round()`), climate cooling mode `max_temp` excluded preset temperatures from range calculation, diagnostics `KeyError` on partial teardown (now uses `.get()`), select `KeyError` on unknown option (now uses `.get()` with fallback), device trigger unsafe dict access (now uses `.get()`), config flow accepted IPv4 addresses with octets >255 (now validated), config flow `parsed.port` could raise `ValueError` on malformed URLs (now wrapped in try/except), camera recorder crashed on corrupt first JPEG frame (now loops to find first valid frame). **WebSocket hardening (6)**: Periodic stale request cleanup task (runs every 15s independent of message loop), `exc_info=True` on all exception logs for stack traces, subscription list copy in `_resubscribe()` to prevent mutation during await, fire-and-forget `send_str` wrapped in try/except (raises `EvonWsNotConnectedError`), `sequenceId` type validation (rejects non-int responses), `_do_subscribe()` stores defensive copy of subscription list (prevents shared reference mutation). **Coordinator hardening (2)**: `exc_info=True` on conversion error logs, second retarget guard after data snapshot identity check. **Input validation (2)**: Bulk service entity ID validation against `INSTANCE_ID_PATTERN`, select entities log warning for unrecognized options. **Camera hardening (3)**: PIL Image context manager for proper resource cleanup, JPEG decode crash handling with graceful fallback, `get_recent_recordings()` FileNotFoundError race fix (handles files deleted between glob and stat). **Data processing (4)**: Security doors `_transform_saved_pictures()` extracted to shared function with None timestamp filtering, WebSocket mappings deduplicated SavedPictures transformation using shared function, home states and scenes processors now skip instances with empty IDs, air quality `EVON_NO_DATA_VALUE = -999` constant extracted from magic numbers. **Service handler hardening**: All 6 service handlers (`handle_refresh`, `handle_reconnect_websocket`, `handle_set_home_state`, `handle_set_season_mode`, `_bulk_api_call`, `_bulk_entity_call`) now validate `entry_data` is a dict before accessing keys. **Other hardening (2)**: Recording duration validation (clamp to 30-3600s), switch negative time clamping and seconds overflow protection. **Statistics compatibility**: `StatisticMeanType` import made optional for older HA versions. **Tests**: 260+ new tests added (994 total, up from 560), covering button, camera, image, statistics, API, WebSocket client/control/mappings, binary sensor, instance ID extraction, and processors. Conftest mock data corrected (Evon API key names for SavedPictures). **CI fixes**: Climate tests updated for HA service-layer validation (`ServiceValidationError`), `test_base_entity.py` module cleanup narrowed to prevent cross-test pollution.
- **v1.17.0**: Snapshot-based camera recording feature with custom Lovelace card. **Recording backend** (`camera_recorder.py`): `EvonCameraRecorder` rapidly polls snapshots and encodes to MP4 via PyAV with timestamp overlay. Services: `evon.start_recording` / `evon.stop_recording`. Recording switch entity for dashboard toggle. `get_recent_recordings()` returns recent MP4s with filename, timestamp, size, and URL. **Custom Lovelace card** (`www/evon-camera-recording-card.js`): Plain HTMLElement (no LitElement dependency) with record button + live stopwatch, recent recordings list with inline `<video>` playback via `auth/sign_path` signed URLs, and "All Recordings" link to media browser. Smart re-rendering: only re-renders when recording state or recordings list actually change, preventing video player flickering. **Frontend registration** (`__init__.py`): the JS card is registered as a static path (`/evon/evon-camera-recording-card.js`). Recordings were originally also a static path (`/evon/recordings/`); **as of v1.22.0 they are served through an authenticated `HomeAssistantView` (`recordings_view.py`)** at the same `/evon/recordings/{filename}` URL, because static paths bypass HA auth and exposed footage to anyone who could reach the HA port. **Card config**: `type: custom:evon-camera-recording-card` with `entity` (camera entity) and optional `recording_switch` (auto-derived if omitted by replacing `camera.` prefix with `switch.` + `_recording` suffix). Camera `extra_state_attributes` now includes `recent_recordings` list. **Key gotchas**: HA's `media_source` integration must be enabled in `configuration.yaml` for media browser. Video URLs use the `/evon/recordings/` view, accessed via `auth/sign_path` signed URLs for inline playback. Lovelace resource must be registered in `/config/.storage/lovelace_resources`.
- **v1.16.0**: Added **Energy Today** and **Energy This Month** calculated sensors. **Energy Today** queries HA's `statistics_during_period()` to get today's consumption from the Energy Total sensor. **Energy This Month** combines Evon's `EnergyDataMonth` array (previous days of this month) with today's consumption from HA statistics. Implementation: `_calculate_energy_today_and_month()` method in coordinator calculates values during each refresh cycle, storing them as `energy_today_calculated` and `energy_this_month_calculated` in meter data. Sensor classes `EvonEnergyTodaySensor` and `EvonEnergyThisMonthSensor` read these calculated values. **Note**: The `statistics_during_period` function is blocking and must be called via `async_add_executor_job()`. Also added `EnergyDataDay` WebSocket subscription for future use. Climate WebSocket updates now subscribe to setpoint limits and recompute preset temperatures to avoid stale clamping. Added group climate services (`all_climate_comfort`, `all_climate_eco`, `all_climate_away`). WebSocket error handling now logs stack traces and separates expected network errors from unexpected failures; MCP WebSocket calls now retry once after reconnect when the socket drops between connect and send. Coordinator WS updates now validate the entity list reference before indexing to avoid stale list access. Added MCP server unit tests (`tests-mcp/`) for API client, tool/resource registration, and CI coverage for them, plus documented logging guidelines and WS error handling policy in DEVELOPMENT.md.
- **v1.15.0**: Camera support for 2N intercom cameras and doorbell snapshot image entities. **Camera**: Live feed via WebSocket using `SetValue ImageRequest=true` to trigger capture, then fetching JPEG from `/temp/` path. **Doorbell Snapshots**: Image entities (`image.py`) for up to 10 historical snapshots from `SavedPictures` property on Security Door. Each snapshot includes timestamp in attributes. **Class name fixes**: Security Door is `Security.Door` (not `SmartCOM.Security.SecurityDoor`), Intercom 2N is `Security.Intercom.2N.Intercom2N` (not `SmartCOM.Intercom.Intercom2N`). **Physical buttons (Taster)**: Confirmed working (Feb 2026) — fully supported as event entities with press type detection in v1.19.0. **Security Door entities**: Door open/closed state (`IsOpen`/`DoorIsOpen`) and call in progress indicator (`CallInProgress`). **Intercom entities**: Doorbell events, door open events, connection status.
- **v1.14.0**: WebSocket-based device control for lights and blinds. Lights use `CallMethod SwitchOn/SwitchOff` for explicit on/off (not `Switch([bool])` which is inconsistent) and `BrightnessSetScaled([brightness, transition])` for dimming. Blinds use `CallMethod MoveToPosition([angle, position])` for position and tilt control with cached values. Non-dimmable lights in light groups skip API calls when already on (for combined lights with Govee). Falls back to HTTP when WebSocket unavailable. Added security doors and intercoms with doorbell events (`evon_doorbell`), RGBW light color temperature support (untested), light/blind group classes, and climate humidity display.
- **v1.13.0**: Added WebSocket support for real-time state updates (read-only).
- **v1.12.0**: Remote access via `my.evon-smarthome.com` relay server. Reconfigure flow now allows switching between local and remote connection types. Security improvements: explicit SSL context with connection limits, header redaction, token TTL with auto-refresh and memory cleanup on close, comprehensive input validation (instance IDs, method names, Engine ID, username, password, host port), asyncio.Lock for token access, HTTP status handling (400/403/404/429/5xx with response.reason), Content-Type validation, Engine ID redaction in diagnostics.
- **v1.11.0**: Added scene support - Evon scenes appear as button entities that can be pressed to execute. Also includes smart meter current sensors (L1/L2/L3), frequency sensor, and feed-in energy sensor from 1.10.3 branch.
- **v1.10.1**: Added optimistic time display for bathroom radiators. Fixed smart meter "Energy Today" sensor - renamed to "Energy (24h Rolling)" with `state_class: measurement` to prevent incorrect negative values in HA Energy Dashboard. The rolling 24h window from Evon can decrease during the day.
- **v1.10.0**: Added configurable non-dimmable lights option, Home Assistant Repairs integration (connection failure alerts after 3 failures, stale entity notifications, config migration warnings), improved home state translations using HA's translation system (proper German/English), hub device for device hierarchy, and fixed `via_device` warnings for HA 2025.12.0 compatibility. Config entry version bumped to 2 with migration support. Added 9 new tests (29 total).
- **v1.9.0**: Added Season Mode select entity for global heating/cooling control via `Base.ehThermostat.IsCool`. Climate presets now correctly map to season-specific `ModeSaved` values (2-4 for heating, 5-7 for cooling). Added `hvac_action` property to climate entities showing current activity (heating/cooling/idle).
- **v1.8.2**: Fixed blind cover optimistic state for group actions. Added `is_moving` optimistic tracking so group open/close buttons work correctly when clicking twice to stop.
- **v1.8.1**: Added optimistic updates for all entities and improved preset icons.
- **v1.8.0**: Added optimistic updates for all controllable entities (lights, covers, climate, switches, select). Changed climate preset names to use HA built-in presets for better UI icons (`eco` instead of `energy_saving`, `away` instead of `freeze_protection`).
- **v1.7.4**: Added optimistic updates for climate target temperature when changing presets.
- **v1.7.3**: Added optimistic updates for climate preset mode to prevent UI flicker.
- **v1.7.2**: Fixed climate preset detection for Thermostat devices (uses `MainState` fallback when `ModeSaved` not present).
- **v1.7.1**: Fixed climate preset mode detection (uses `ModeSaved` property instead of `Mode`), added cooling/heating mode display.
- **v1.7.0**: Added bathroom radiator (electric heater) support with timer functionality. Added MCP tools (`list_bathroom_radiators`, `bathroom_radiator_control`) and resource (`evon://bathroom_radiators`).
- **v1.6.0**: Added automatic cleanup of stale/orphaned entities on integration reload.
- **v1.5.2**: Fixed reconfigure flow 500 error with modern HA config flow patterns.
- **v1.5.0**: Added Home State selector (select entity) for switching between home modes. Added MCP tools (`list_home_states`, `set_home_state`) and resource (`evon://home_state`).
- **v1.4.1**: Removed non-functional button event entities (WebSocket events weren't detected at that time; re-implemented in v1.19.0)
- **v1.4.0**: Added event entities for physical buttons (removed in v1.4.1, re-implemented in v1.19.0 with press type detection)
- **v1.3.3**: Fixed blind control - use `Open`/`Close` instead of `MoveUp`/`MoveDown`
- **v1.3.2**: Added logbook integration for switch click events
- **v1.3.1**: Best practices: Entity categories, availability detection, HomeAssistantError exceptions, EntityDescription refactoring
- **v1.3.0**: Added smart meter, air quality, and valve sensors. Added diagnostics support.
- **v1.2.1**: Added German translations for DACH region customers
- **v1.2.0**: Added optional area sync feature (sync Evon rooms to HA areas)
- **v1.1.5**: Fixed AbortFlow exception handling (was causing "Unexpected error" for already configured)
- **v1.1.4**: Improved error handling in API client (JSON decode, unexpected errors)
- **v1.1.3**: Fixed config flow "Unexpected error" by adding strings.json and fixing auth error handling
- **v1.1.2**: Fixed switch detection (corrected class name to `SmartCOM.Switch`)
- **v1.1.1**: Documentation and branding updates, HACS buttons
- **v1.1.0**: Added sensors, switches, options flow, reconfigure flow, MCP resources and scenes
- **v1.0.0**: Initial release with lights, blinds, and climate support
