# CLAUDE.md — SalesforceDocGen Project Guidelines

## Critical: Blob.toPdf() Image URL Rules

The Spring '26 `Blob.toPdf()` rendering engine has strict requirements for image URLs in HTML:

- **MUST use relative Salesforce paths**: `/sfc/servlet.shepherd/version/download/<ContentVersionId>`
- **NEVER use absolute URLs**: `https://domain.com/sfc/servlet.shepherd/...` — fails silently (no exception, broken image)
- **NEVER use data URIs**: `data:image/png;base64,...` — not supported, renders broken

In `DocGenService.buildPdfImageMap()`, do NOT prepend `URL.getOrgDomainUrl()` to ContentVersion download URLs. Keep them relative. The `Blob.toPdf()` engine resolves relative Salesforce paths internally.

## Critical: Zero-Heap PDF Image Rendering

For PDF output, `{%ImageField}` tags with ContentVersion IDs MUST skip blob loading. The `currentOutputFormat` static variable is set to `'PDF'` before `processXml()` calls. In `buildImageXml()`, when `currentOutputFormat == 'PDF'` and the field value is a ContentVersion ID (`068xxx`), query only `Id, FileExtension` (NOT `VersionData`) and store the relative URL. This is what enables unlimited images in PDFs without heap limits.

**NEVER** add `VersionData` to the SOQL query in the PDF path. Each image blob would consume 100KB-5MB+ of heap, and with multiple images this immediately exceeds governor limits.

## PDF Image Pipeline

### How template images are prepared (on save)

When an admin saves a template version (via `DocGenController.saveTemplate()`), the system calls `DocGenService.extractAndSaveTemplateImages(templateId, versionId)`. This method:

1. Downloads the DOCX/PPTX ZIP from the template's ContentVersion
2. Reads `word/_rels/document.xml.rels` to find all `<Relationship>` entries with `Type` containing `/image`
3. For each image relationship, extracts the image blob from `word/media/`
4. Saves each image as a new ContentVersion with `Title = docgen_tmpl_img_<versionId>_<relId>` and `FirstPublishLocationId = versionId`

This pre-extraction is essential — it creates committed ContentVersion records that `Blob.toPdf()` can reference by relative URL at generation time.

### How template images are rendered (on generate)

At PDF generation time, `buildPdfImageMap()` queries for these pre-committed CVs:
- Finds the active template version
- Queries `ContentVersion WHERE Title LIKE 'docgen_tmpl_img_<versionId>_%'`
- Builds relative URLs: `/sfc/servlet.shepherd/version/download/<cvId>`
- `DocGenHtmlRenderer.convertToHtml()` embeds these as `<img src="/sfc/...">` in the HTML
- `Blob.toPdf()` resolves the relative paths and renders the images

## Package Info

- Website: https://portwoodglobalsolutions.com

## Key Architecture

- PDF rendering has two paths in `mergeTemplate()`:
  1. **Pre-decomposed (preferred)**: Loads XML parts from ContentVersions saved during template version creation. Skips ZIP decompression entirely. ~75% heap savings. Used for PDF output when XML CVs exist.
  2. **ZIP path (fallback)**: Full base64 decode + ZIP decompression. Used for DOCX/PPTX output, or PDF when pre-decomposed parts don't exist (older templates not yet re-saved).
- After merge: `buildPdfImageMap()` → `DocGenHtmlRenderer.convertToHtml()` → `Blob.toPdf()` with VF page fallback
- The Spring '26 Release Update "Use the Visualforce PDF Rendering Service for Blob.toPdf() Invocations" is REQUIRED

## Critical: Giant-Query PDF Has THREE Merge-Tag Resolution Paths

`DocGenGiantQueryAssembler` does **not** go through `processXml()`. Tags are resolved in three distinct layers before `Blob.toPdf()`:

1. **Row-level tags (inside the `{#Rel}...{/Rel}` loop)** — rendered per-record by `DocGenService.renderLoopBodyForRecords()` → `processXml()`. Full formatter support (currency, date, locale, aggregates, everything processXml does).
2. **Parent-level tags (outside the loop — headers, titles, summaries)** — resolved by `DocGenGiantQueryAssembler.resolveParentMergeTags()`. Matches `{Field}`, `{Owner.Name}`, and `{Field:format}` forms. Format-suffix tags are routed back through `DocGenService.processXmlForTest()` with a mini 1-field data map so locale/currency/date formatting is reused (v1.51.0+).
3. **Aggregate tags (grand totals across the giant relationship)** — `{SUM:Rel.Field}`, `{COUNT:Rel}`, etc. resolved by `DocGenGiantQueryAssembler.resolveGiantAggregateTags()` via a single SOQL aggregate query, governor-safe for 60K+ rows (v1.50.0+). Field validation is against `Schema.getGlobalDescribe()`, NOT the query config's declared columns — aggregate fields don't have to be rendered columns (v1.52.0+).

**When adding a new merge-tag feature**, decide which of the three paths it belongs to and implement it there — adding to `processXml()` alone won't make it work for giant queries. Missing from all three paths = silent pass-through as literal template text in the PDF.

**Special keywords `{Today}` and `{Now}` are NOT implemented anywhere.** They pass through unresolved in every path. Adding them is a future feature, not a regression.

**Never re-parse `Query_Config__c` from new giant-query code paths.** Templates use three config formats (V1 flat, V2 JSON, V3 tree). `JSON.deserializeUntyped` throws on V1 flat strings — any assembler-side code that tries to read config must either (a) detect format first, or (b) receive pre-parsed `childObjectName` / `lookupField` / `whereClause` from the caller. `DocGenGiantQueryBatch` passes these into `DocGenGiantQueryAssembler`'s 7-arg constructor for exactly this reason (v1.53.0+). The old 4-arg constructor keeps a V3-JSON fallback for direct invocations.

## DOCX Watermarks (VML pict — header-embedded)

Word inserts watermarks via VML inside header XML: `<w:pict><v:shape style="..."><v:imagedata r:id="rIdN"/></v:shape></w:pict>`. NOT DrawingML — different parser path. Three things had to align before they rendered:

1. **`DocGenService.namespaceImageRelIds`** rewrites image relIds in header rels (so they don't collide with body relIds). It was only handling `r:embed="..."` (DrawingML). Watermarks use `r:id="..."` on `<v:imagedata>`. Now scopes a second pass to `<v:imagedata>` elements specifically — see `namespaceAttrInXml` with `scopeTag = '<v:imagedata'`. Don't widen this scope or hyperlinks (also `r:id`) get clobbered.

2. **`DocGenHtmlRenderer.processBodyContent` + `processRun`** had no awareness of `<w:pict>`. Added it alongside `<w:drawing>` in both element-walk loops. Without this, the pict markup gets silently dropped as an unknown tag — relids exist, headers render, but no `<img>` is emitted.

3. **`processPict()`** detects watermark heuristics (`rotation:` in style, `mso-position-horizontal:center`, `PowerPlusWaterMarkObject`, `WordPictureWatermark`) and emits a `<div class="docgen-watermark">` with `position:fixed`. Whitewash overlay is built by `extractWatermarks` from `data-wash` attribute and layered as `rgba(255,255,255,X)` between watermark (z:0) and body content (z:2 via `.docgen-body-content` wrapper).

### Why we use a CSS layered whitewash, not opacity

Salesforce's Flying Saucer build does NOT honor CSS `opacity` (CSS3) OR SVG `opacity` attribute. We tried both — image renders at full strength regardless. The S-Docs / Stack Overflow trick of layering a semi-transparent white div over the image works because `rgba()` in `background-color` IS supported (it's a color value, separate code path from opacity). Default wash is 0.95 (image visible at ~5%). Word's `<v:imagedata gain="..." blacklevel="..."/>` washout markers are intentionally NOT translated — the heuristic produced too-strong watermarks (~34% strength).

### Why position:fixed centering uses top:50%/left:50%/margin

Tried `top:0;left:0;right:0;bottom:0;text-align:center` (CSS 2.1 four-side trick) — Flying Saucer interprets `position:fixed` as `position:absolute` relative to body, and the wrapper anchors to wherever body content ends (bottom-right of short documents). The percentage centering with negative margins works because the wrapper's `left:50%` puts the LEFT edge at body midpoint, then negative margin-left pulls it back by half the image width.

### Watermark rotation is NOT supported

Flying Saucer doesn't honor `transform: rotate()` (CSS3) or any of its `-fs-` proprietary aliases for rotation. Word watermarks rendered into PDF appear UPRIGHT regardless of the `rotation:` value in VML style. Only fix is a pre-rotated PNG. Don't waste time trying SVG `<g transform="rotate()">` — Flying Saucer's SVG renderer doesn't render `<image>` elements at all (we tried and got blank output).

### Watermark scaling is NOT supported

`@page background-size` is fundamentally ignored by Flying Saucer regardless of value (`contain`, `cover`, percentages, explicit pt — all produce the same native-size render). `background-size` on `body` similarly fails for our use case. We tried every CSS variant.

The only way to get a different display size is to physically resize the image bytes. Apex has no native image manipulation APIs, and Salesforce file renditions max out at THUMB720BY480 (too small for full-page watermarks). Building a pure-Apex JPEG codec was deemed not worth the 2000+ line investment.

**Critical: Flying Saucer renders at 96 DPI, NOT 72 DPI.** This trips up everyone who's used to the PDF spec saying 1pt = 1/72 inch. Flying Saucer interprets image pixel dimensions at 96 DPI for display sizing. So a 612×792 px image (which is 8.5×11" at 72 DPI) renders at only 6.375×8.25" on a letter page — too small. To fill a letter page, the image must be **816×1056 px** (8.5×11" at 96 DPI).

Conversion table for full-page watermarks:
| Page size | Pixels at 96 DPI |
|---|---|
| Letter (8.5×11 in) | 816 × 1056 |
| A4 (8.27×11.69 in) | 794 × 1123 |
| Legal (8.5×14 in) | 816 × 1344 |

**Document as a constraint:** users must resize their watermark image to these pixel dimensions BEFORE inserting in Word (or uploading via the Watermark/Background tab), and keep Word's Watermark scale at 100% (Auto and percentage scales are ignored).

**Don't re-attempt this:** we explored every CSS path (`@page background-size: cover/contain/auto/Npt/N%`, `body background-size`, `position:fixed` div clipping, oversize wrappers, negative offsets, page-bleed extensions). Flying Saucer's @page background-image only honors the URL — sizing/positioning hints are dropped. The pre-scale via Blob.toPdf trick we use for rich text inline images doesn't work here either: Blob.toPdf passes JPEG sources through unchanged at native size (display scaling is via PDF coordinate transform, not image rasterization).

## DOCX Rich Text Inline Images (Lightning ContentReference / 0EM)

When Salesforce stores rich text field images in Lightning Experience, they get a ContentReference ID with `0EM` prefix (NOT a ContentDocument or ContentVersion). The `<img src="/servlet/rtaImage?eid=...&feoid=...&refid=0EM...">` URL fetches the bytes — but **only via privileged Salesforce-internal mechanisms**. Apex SOQL doesn't expose `0EM` as an SObject. Apex callouts get redirect-loops. LWC `fetch()` gets `Allow-Credentials:false`. Browser `<img>`+canvas gets tainted. Salesforce engineered the platform against client-side or Apex-side direct access.

### The PDF-extract trick (the only path that works)

`Blob.toPdf()` has internal resolver privileges Apex/LWC don't expose — it CAN fetch `rtaImage` URLs server-side without HTTP callouts, session IDs, or any external authentication. We exploit this:

1. **Server (`DocGenController.renderImageAsPdfBase64(imageUrl)`)** — wraps the rtaImage URL in a minimal HTML document (`<img src="...">`), calls `Blob.toPdf()`. Returns a single-image PDF as base64.
2. **Client (`docGenPdfImageExtractor.js`)** — parses the PDF object stream, finds the first `/Subtype /Image` XObject. For `/Filter /DCTDecode` (JPEG, the common case Flying Saucer emits), the stream bytes ARE the JPEG file — use directly.
3. **Client (`docGenRunner.js`)** — for each rtaImage URL in `imageUrlMap` (server emits these unchanged from rich text), runs render→extract, embeds bytes in DOCX `word/media/`.

PDF is in-memory only at every step (Blob in Apex → base64 across Aura → JS Uint8Array → garbage collected). Zero ContentDocument records, zero filesystem writes, zero cleanup needed.

### Dead-end matrix (don't re-attempt these)

| Approach | Why it fails |
|---|---|
| Apex SOQL on 0EM | Not exposed via `Schema.getGlobalDescribe()` — no SObject token |
| Apex callout to `/servlet/rtaImage` with `UserInfo.getSessionId()` | Recursive redirect loop: file.force.com → lightning.force.com/content/session → my.salesforce.com/visualforce/session → loops back. API session can't satisfy browser-cookie auth |
| Apex callout to `/services/data/.../richTextImageFields/.../...` with `UserInfo.getSessionId()` | Works in anonymous Apex (returns 200 OK with bytes) BUT fails in LWC-triggered AuraEnabled context. Also: session-ID callouts add AppExchange security review friction even for self-org |
| `PageReference.getContent()` on rtaImage URL | `Maximum redirects (100) exceeded` — same loop |
| `frontdoor.jsp?sid=...&retURL=...` session bridge | Returns 200 with bridged session in `Set-Cookie`, but Salesforce platform redacts the value to `SESSION_ID_REMOVED` before Apex can read it |
| LWC `fetch('/services/data/...', { credentials: 'include' })` | Returns `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: false` — browser drops response. Architectural CSRF protection, can't be flipped via Setup → CORS allowlist |
| LWC `<img crossorigin="anonymous">` + `<canvas>` extraction | CORS taints canvas, `toBlob()` throws SecurityError. Without `crossorigin`, image renders but canvas is also tainted |
| Named Credential to org self | Still ultimately needs cross-domain auth. Adds install-time customer config burden, doesn't avoid the underlying CORS architecture |

### What also doesn't work end-to-end

- **Server-side preview/sample DOCX** — `processAndReturnDocument` → `assembleZip` runs server-side. The PDF-extract trick requires the client to do the parsing (Apex has no PDF parser). Preview generates DOCX with the rich text image as a broken placeholder. Live with it; document the limitation.
- **PDF output** — works fine. `Blob.toPdf()` resolves rtaImage URLs natively in PDF rendering. No special handling needed.

### When extending to other unhandled image filters

`docGenPdfImageExtractor.js` currently handles `DCTDecode` (JPEG) and passes through `JPXDecode` (JPEG 2000). For `FlateDecode` (zlib-compressed raw RGB pixels), it logs a warning and returns null. To add support: bundle pako (zlib inflate) + a minimal PNG encoder. Only justified if Flying Saucer ever switches from JPEG output, which hasn't happened in testing.

## HTML Template Pipeline (v1.61.0+)

HTML templates are raw `.html` files (exported from Google Docs, Notion, Apple Pages, ChatGPT — anything that produces HTML) with merge tags inlined. Type `HTML` + Output Format `PDF`. Added in `feature/html-templates` branch.

### Why HTML is a first-class template type

Every authoring tool exports HTML cleanly. HTML doesn't have OOXML's tag-fragmentation problem (`<w:r>` runs splitting `{Field}` across boundaries). Supporting HTML directly — rather than translating every dialect of DOCX — unlocks every modern content workflow with zero dialect hell. Previous attempt at "DOCX dialect normalizer" (deleted branch `feature/docx-dialect-support`) was solving the wrong problem expensively.

### Pipeline (DocGenService)

1. `mergeTemplate()` detects `templateType == 'HTML'` and branches to `mergeHtmlTemplate()` *before* any DOCX-specific logic runs (no ZIP decode, no rels path, no pre-decomposed XML lookups).
2. `mergeHtmlTemplate()`:
   - Base64-decodes the ContentVersion to the raw HTML string.
   - Calls `extractHtmlStyleBlocks()` to preserve `<style>` contents from `<head>`.
   - Calls `extractHtmlBodyContent()` to strip `<html>/<head>/<body>` wrappers.
   - Runs `processXml()` on body + `Header_Html__c` + `Footer_Html__c` fields. The same merge-tag engine Word templates use — field substitution, formatters, conditionals, loops all work. `<w:tr>`/`<w:p>` container expansion is DOCX-specific and falls through to the "innerXml repeat" fallback for HTML (user writes `{#Loop}<tr>...</tr>{/Loop}` explicitly).
   - Calls `substituteHtmlPageCounters()` on header/footer HTML: `{PageNumber}` → `<span class="dg-pgn"></span>`, `{TotalPages}` → `<span class="dg-tpg"></span>`.
   - Calls `wrapHtmlForPdf()` to produce a full HTML document with Flying Saucer `@page` margin boxes and running elements.
3. `renderPdf()` sees `mr.templateType == 'HTML'` and passes `mr.documentXml` straight to `Blob.toPdf()` — skipping `DocGenHtmlRenderer.convertToHtml()` entirely.

### Header/footer architecture

Stored on the template record as two LongTextArea fields: `Header_Html__c` and `Footer_Html__c`. Authored in the admin UI via **`lightning-input-rich-text`** WYSIWYG editors on a dedicated "Header / Footer" tab that only shows when `Type__c == 'HTML'`. Both fields get full merge-tag processing (so `{Name}` in the footer resolves to the record's Name), and `{PageNumber}` / `{TotalPages}` tokens survive through merge and get substituted to CSS-counter spans right before the final wrap.

### Flying Saucer CSS features used

- `@page { @top-center { content: "Page " counter(page) " of " counter(pages); } }` — the **only** reliable way to emit page numbers. Flying Saucer resolves `counter(page)` / `counter(pages)` **only inside @page rules**; the same call in a `::before` pseudo-element on a DOM node does not resolve even if that node is hoisted via `position: running()`.
- `.docgen-running-header { position: running(dgheader); }` + `@page { @top-center { content: element(dgheader); } }` — for rich HTML headers without page counters (images, tables, styling survive).
- `{PageNumber}` / `{TotalPages}` tokens get passthrough treatment in `processXml()` (same mechanism as `{@Signature_}`) so they survive merge-tag resolution. `wrapHtmlForPdf()` detects them in the header/footer text and generates `@page` margin box `content` CSS with literal strings + `counter(page)` / `counter(pages)` calls.

**Tradeoff:** headers/footers that contain page counters get their HTML markup flattened to plain text because the `@page` margin box `content` property only accepts strings + counter()/string() functions. Rich formatting (images, tables, bold, color) survives only for non-counter headers via the running-element path. Users who want both rich styling *and* page numbers have to pick — current API can't combine them. If this becomes a real constraint, the fallback is to nest the page counter inside a table cell using `string-set` + `string()` in a more advanced pattern, but that's significantly more complex.

### Zip uploads (Google Docs "Download → Web Page") — client-side break-apart

Google Docs's Web Page export is a zip containing `<title>.html` + an `images/` folder. Two constraints drove the architecture:

1. Salesforce's File Upload Security blocks `.zip` uploads by default ("Your company doesn't support the following file types: .zip"). So the zip can never become a ContentVersion.
2. Server-side `Compression.ZipReader` on image-heavy zips burns 5–10 MB of heap fast — single Apex request is capped at 6 MB sync.

Solution: **break the zip apart client-side, upload each piece as its own Apex call.** The LWC does the unzip, then streams parts to two tiny endpoints with a single file's heap per call.

**Client (`docGenAdmin/docGenZipReader.js`)** — pure JS ZIP reader, no external deps. Uses native `DecompressionStream('deflate-raw')` for the compression primitive and does the central-directory / local-header parsing in ~100 lines. Supports store + deflate methods, which is everything real-world ZIP producers emit. `readZip(ArrayBuffer)` returns `[{name, data: Uint8Array}, ...]`.

**Client flow (`docGenAdmin.handleHtmlFileSelected`)**:
1. Read the file as `ArrayBuffer`.
2. If `.zip`: `readZip()` gives entries. Find first `.html`/`.htm` → body. Collect image-extension entries (png/jpg/jpeg/gif/bmp/tif/tiff/svg).
3. If `.html`/`.htm`: read as text, no images.
4. For each image: `saveHtmlTemplateImage(templateId, fileName, base64)` → returns `{contentVersionId, url}`. One image per Apex call = bounded heap.
5. Client rewrites every `"originalPath"` and `'originalPath'` in the HTML to the returned URL.
6. `saveHtmlTemplateBody(templateId, fileName, htmlContent)` saves the finished HTML. Returns `{contentVersionId, contentDocumentId}` — same shape `lightning-file-upload` produces, so `uploadedContentVersionId` gets set and the existing "Save as New Version" flow takes over without branching.

**Server endpoints (`DocGenController`)** — both are ~20 lines:
- `saveHtmlTemplateImage(templateId, fileName, base64Content)` — base64-decodes, inserts one ContentVersion titled `docgen_html_img_<templateId>_<ts>_<basename>` linked to the template, returns `{contentVersionId, fileName, url}`.
- `saveHtmlTemplateBody(templateId, fileName, htmlContent)` — stores the already-rewritten HTML as a ContentVersion titled `docgen_html_body_<templateId>_<ts>`, returns `{contentVersionId, contentDocumentId, fileName}`.

Neither endpoint does any zip parsing, src-rewriting, or heap-heavy work. The client-side unzip is free compute (runs in the user's browser) and the per-image upload pattern means heap usage is O(single image size), not O(total template size).

At render time, `mergeHtmlTemplate()` reads the body CV directly — it's already the rewritten HTML with `/sfc/...` URLs. `Blob.toPdf()` resolves those URLs natively.

### Giant-query PDFs for HTML (v1.61+)

HTML templates use the same batched giant-query pipeline DOCX uses. When a scout finds > 2000 child rows, `DocGenController.generateDocumentGiantQuery` / `launchGiantQueryPdfBatch` branch on `Type__c`:

- DOCX templates load `word/document.xml` (pre-decomposed CV or zip fallback).
- HTML templates load the active version's `Content_Version_Id__c` body CV directly — it's already the rewritten HTML with `/sfc/` image URLs.

`DocGenService.extractLoopBody` was extended to detect HTML containers (`<tr>`, `<li>`) in addition to DOCX `<w:tr>`. Safe for both types because DOCX XML doesn't contain literal HTML tags and vice versa.

`DocGenGiantQueryBatch.execute()` detects HTML vs DOCX source by checking whether the innerXml contains `<w:`. For HTML source it uses the rendered rows directly; for DOCX it runs `xmlRowsToHtmlRows()` to convert Word XML into HTML `<tr><td>`. Same batch class, same heap bounds (50 rows per fragment × 12MB queueable heap).

`DocGenGiantQueryAssembler.buildHtmlTemplate()` branches on `Type__c`. HTML-type routes to `buildHtmlTemplateForHtmlType()` which:
1. Loads the body CV directly.
2. Runs `resolveParentMergeTags` + `resolveGiantAggregateTags` on the body content.
3. Finds the loop-row boundary and replaces with `{ROWS}` placeholder (same logic as DOCX but looking at HTML `<tr>`/`<li>`/`</table>` positions).
4. Calls `DocGenService.wrapHtmlForPdf()` to apply `@page` margin boxes, running header/footer elements, and page counter CSS.

Result: HTML templates get the same 60K+ row capacity DOCX has. Tested with synthetic contact sets in `DocGenHtmlTemplateTest.giantQueryPdfBatchProcessesHtmlTemplate`.

### What HTML templates do NOT support (yet)

- **Inline data URI images** (`<img src="data:image/png;base64,...">`): `Blob.toPdf()` does not decode data URIs. Zip uploads from Google Docs don't hit this because images come as separate files, but Notion/ChatGPT/single-HTML uploads with inline base64 images will render broken. Future work: extend `extractAndSaveHtmlTemplateAssets` to also walk the HTML for `data:image/` URIs, saving each to a ContentVersion and rewriting the src.
- **Save-to-record async path**: untested. `generateDocument()` routes HTML to `savePdfFile()` just like Word-PDF, so it should work — but not explicitly validated.

### Reference: Google Docs HTML export

Exports from Google Docs (File → Download → Web Page) produce class-heavy but clean markup: `<style>` block with `.c0`–`.cN` classes + `<body>` with those classes applied. No `mso-` junk like Word saves. `extractHtmlStyleBlocks` preserves these classes so formatting survives end-to-end.

## Client-Side DOCX Assembly (In Progress)

DOCX generation now uses client-side ZIP assembly to avoid Apex heap limits:

### How it works
1. Server calls `generateDocumentParts()` which merges XML using `currentOutputFormat='PDF'` trick (skips blob loading)
2. Server returns: `allXmlParts` (merged XML + passthrough entries), `imageCvIdMap` (mediaPath → CV ID), `imageBase64Map` (template media)
3. Client deduplicates CV IDs and calls `getContentVersionBase64()` for each **unique** CV — each call gets fresh 6MB heap
4. Client builds ZIP from scratch via `buildDocx()` in `docGenZipWriter.js` (pure JS, no dependencies)
5. Download works for unlimited size. Save-to-record blocked by Aura 4MB payload limit (needs chunking or alternative).

### Key files
- `docGenRunner/docGenZipWriter.js` — Pure JS ZIP writer (store mode, CRC-32). Exports `buildDocx(xmlParts, mediaParts)` and `buildDocxFromShell()`
- `DocGenService.generateDocumentParts()` — Returns merged parts without ZIP assembly
- `DocGenController.getContentVersionBase64()` — Returns single CV blob as base64, each call = fresh heap
- `DocGenController.generateDocumentParts()` — AuraEnabled endpoint

### Important: rels XML must include ALL image relationships
In both `mergeTemplate()` (full ZIP path, ~line 174) and `tryMergeFromPreDecomposed()` (~line 293), the pending images loop that adds relationships to rels XML must process ALL images, not just ones with blobs. URL-only images need rels entries too for DOCX.

### LWS Constraints
- Lightning Web Security blocks `fetch()` to `/sfc/servlet.shepherd/` URLs (CORS redirect to `file.force.com`)
- All binary data must be returned via Apex, not client-side fetch
- `Blob` constructor in LWC rejects non-standard MIME types — use `application/octet-stream` for DOCX downloads

## E-Signatures (v3 — Guided Signing, Packets, Sequential)

Major overhaul shipped in v1.43.0 (April 2026). Architecture is sophisticated but the codebase is currently fragile after a 24-hour iteration sprint. See "FRAGILITY NOTES" section below.

### v3 Tag Syntax

Format: `{@Signature_Role:Order:Type}`

- **Role** — signer role (Buyer, Seller, Witness, Loan_Officer with underscores for multi-word)
- **Order** — sequence number per-role (optional, defaults to 1)
- **Type** — Full | Initials | Date | DatePick (optional, defaults to Full)

Backward compatible: `{@Signature_Buyer}` still works (treated as `:1:Full`).

### Data Model
- `DocGen_Signature_Request__c` — parent record. Fields: `Template__c`, `Template_Ids__c` (packet), `Status__c`, `Signing_Order__c` (Parallel/Sequential), `Email_Status__c` (delivery diagnostics), `Signature_Data__c` (cached preview HTML + image map)
- `DocGen_Signer__c` — one per signer. Fields: `Role_Name__c`, `Status__c` (Pending/Viewed/Signed/Cancelled/Declined), `Signature_Data__c` (typed name), `PIN_Hash__c`, `PIN_Verified_At__c`, `Decline_Reason__c`, `Reminder_Sent_At__c`, `Sort_Order__c`
- `DocGen_Signature_Placement__c` — NEW v3 child of Signer. One record per signature/initial/date placement. Fields: `Sequence_Order__c`, `Placement_Type__c`, `Status__c`, `Signed_Value__c`, `Signed_At__c`, `Tag_Text__c`, `Document_Index__c`, `Section_Context__c`
- `DocGen_Signature_Audit__c` — immutable audit. IP, user agent, hash, consent, PIN verified timestamp
- `DocGen_Signature_PDF__e` — platform event for async PDF generation AND notifications

### Critical: Two Code Paths That Need Consolidation

**This is the #1 fragility issue.** There are two methods that do almost-but-not-quite the same thing:

1. `DocGenSignatureSenderController.createTemplateSignerRequestWithOrder()` — called by LWC sender
2. `DocGenSignatureSenderController.createTemplateSignatureRequestForFlow()` — called by Flow action

Both:
- Insert request record
- Call `mergeTemplateForSignature()` for preview
- Build preview HTML with placement spans
- Call `createSignersAndNotify()` which creates signers + placements
- Send branded emails

Differences (each a potential bug):
- LWC version sets `Signing_Order__c`, Flow version doesn't
- LWC version calls `injectPlacementSpans()`, Flow version calls `convertToHtml()` directly
- Default `sendEmails` value differs

**Next session must consolidate these into one shared private method.**

### Signing Page Flow

The VF page `DocGenSignature.page` runs in guest user context and has multiple states:
- `loading` → `error` (token invalid) | `verify` (PIN entry) | `guided` (v3 signing) | `signature` (v2 fallback)
- Guided state: shows full document HTML, sticky action bar at bottom, arrow indicator on current placement
- Each placement signed individually via `signPlacement()` remoting — persists to `DocGen_Signature_Placement__c.Status__c = 'Signed'`
- Signer can leave and resume — PIN re-verification required on return
- After all placements: consent checkbox + final submit → `saveSignature()` publishes platform event

### Critical: Guest User Constraints

Guest users CANNOT:
- Send email without OWA (`setOrgWideEmailAddressId` required)
- Call `Auth.SessionManagement.getCurrentSession()` — throws uncatchable session error
- Query User table
- Access ContentVersion via `/sfc/servlet.shepherd/` URLs (browser auth blocks)

Guest user code paths in `DocGenSignatureController.cls`:
- `validateToken`, `sendPin`, `verifyPin`, `getSignerPlacements`, `signPlacement`, `getImageBase64`, `saveSignature`, `declineSignature`, `stampAndReturnSource`

The image proxy `getImageBase64()` returns base64 for guest users since they can't fetch /sfc/ URLs. Signing page JS replaces `<img src="/sfc/...">` with data URIs.

`captureClientIp()` MUST check `UserInfo.getUserType() != 'Guest'` before calling `Auth.SessionManagement.getCurrentSession()`.

### Platform Event Trigger

`DocGenSignaturePdfTrigger` runs as Automated Process user (system context). Handles:
- All-signers-complete → enqueue `TemplateSignaturePdfQueueable` for PDF generation + send `sendAllSignedNotification`
- Some-signers-pending → send `sendSignerCompletedNotification` for last signer; if Sequential, send next signer's invite email
- Declined → send `sendDeclineNotification`

Guest users publish the event via `EventBus.publish()` from `saveSignature()` and `declineSignature()`. This bridges guest → system context for email sending and User table queries.

### Email Service

`DocGenSignatureEmailService` — handles ALL signature-related emails. Methods:
- `sendSignatureRequestEmails(signers, docTitle, requestId)` — initial branded invitations
- `sendSignerCompletedNotification(requestId, signer)` — sent to creator when one signer completes
- `sendAllSignedNotification(requestId)` — sent to creator when all done
- `sendDeclineNotification(requestId, signer, reason)` — sent to creator on decline

OWA REQUIRED in production. There's a `Test.isRunningTest()` bypass that skips the OWA check — this is a code smell that next session should fix properly.

`Email_Status__c` field on the request shows delivery diagnostics — admins check this when signers report not receiving emails. Common error messages are explained in the field value (no OWA, deliverability disabled, daily limit, etc.).

Reply-to is set to the request creator's email so signer replies go to the actual sender, not the OWA.

### Reminder Schedulable

`DocGenSignatureReminderSchedulable` queries pending signers past `Signature_Reminder_Hours__c` threshold and sends one reminder per signer (tracked via `Reminder_Sent_At__c`). Auto-scheduled hourly when admin enables reminders in settings via `DocGenSetupController.saveReminderSettings()`.

Test note: has `@TestVisible private static DateTime testThresholdOverride` for tests since CreatedDate can't be set in tests.

### Setup Validation

`DocGenSetupController.validateSignatureSetup()` returns a checklist of pass/fail items shown in the signature settings UI:
1. Site URL configured
2. Active Salesforce Site exists
3. OWA configured and valid
4. Guest permission set assigned
5. VF pages deployed

### Namespace Issue (PRODUCTION)

In subscriber orgs, custom field API names come back from SObject `JSON.serialize` with namespace prefix: `portwoodglobal__Signature_OWA_Id__c` not `Signature_OWA_Id__c`. The LWC `getSettings()` wire returned the SObject directly which broke field access in production.

Fix: `DocGenSetupController.getSettingsFresh()` returns a plain `Map<String, Object>` with unqualified field names. `docGenSignatureSettings.js` uses this method instead of the cacheable `getSettings()`.

### v3 Component Map

**LWC components:**
- `docGenSignatureSender` — record-page component for creating requests. Multi-template selection, signer rows with auto-detection, preview modal, signing order toggle
- `docGenSignatureSettings` — admin settings with setup validation checklist, OWA selector, reminder configuration
- `docGenAdmin` — template manager (createTemplate now correctly persists `Test_Record_Id__c`)
- `docGenAdminGuide` — DEPRECATED stub redirecting to Command Hub Learning Center
- `docGenCommandHub` — main app tab with Learning Center containing all v3 docs

**Apex classes:**
- `DocGenSignatureController` — guest user endpoints (validateToken, sendPin, verifyPin, getSignerPlacements, signPlacement, getImageBase64, saveSignature, declineSignature, stampAndReturnSource)
- `DocGenSignatureSenderController` — internal user endpoints (createTemplateSignerRequest*, createPacketSignerRequest, getTemplateSignaturePlacements, getDocumentPreviewHtml, plus lots of legacy)
- `DocGenSignatureService` — stamping logic (`stampSignaturesInXml` with placement awareness), `TemplateSignaturePdfQueueable`, `buildVerificationBlockHtml`
- `DocGenSignatureEmailService` — all email sending
- `DocGenSignatureFlowAction` — Flow invocable with `Signer` apex type
- `DocGenSignatureReminderSchedulable` — reminder cron job
- `DocGenSignaturePdfTrigger` — platform event trigger (notifications, sequential signing, PDF generation enqueue)

### Permission Sets

Three sets, all updated for v3:
- `DocGen_Admin` — full CRUD on all signature objects including new placement object, all new fields
- `DocGen_User` — read/edit on most fields, no delete
- `DocGen_Guest_Signature` — READ on requests/signers/placements; CREATE on audits; access to DocGenSign, DocGenSignature, DocGenVerify VF pages

When adding new fields, update ALL THREE permission sets (this has been a recurring miss).

### FRAGILITY NOTES (post v1.43-1.44 sprint)

After 24 hours of iterative changes, several areas are fragile and need refactoring:

1. **Two signature creation paths** (LWC vs Flow) must be consolidated into one shared method
2. **Test coverage hovers at 74-75%** — adding new code drops it below threshold; we need integration tests that exercise full pipelines, not unit tests that mock around problems
3. **`Test.isRunningTest()` bypass in DocGenSignatureEmailService** — code smell, should restructure to test email assembly without the OWA gate
4. **Test assertions tweaked to pass** rather than fixing root causes — many tests assert `notEquals(null)` instead of meaningful values
5. **Throw-vs-catch pattern in Flow action is split** — validation throws (backward compat), runtime errors return in Result. Inconsistent.
6. **Email status tracking is new** — the `Email_Status__c` field is populated but no UI surfaces it yet on the signature request record page
7. **Signer apex type AND legacy parallel lists** in Flow action — backward compat overhead
8. **Image proxy untested** — `getImageBase64()` works in theory but hasn't been validated with a real template containing template images

### Production Email Diagnosis

When emails don't arrive, check in this order:
1. **Setup > Deliverability** — must be "All Email" (default in scratch is "System Email Only")
2. **OWA "Allow All Profiles"** — in OWA settings, must be checked or specific profiles listed include the sender's profile
3. **OWA verified** — green checkmark next to the address
4. **Daily email limit** — Setup > Company Information shows remaining sends
5. **DNS/SPF** — domain must have `include:_spf.salesforce.com` in TXT record
6. **DMARC** — `p=none` is fine; `p=reject` will block
7. **DKIM** — Setup > DKIM Keys, create + activate, add CNAME records to DNS
8. **`Email_Status__c` field** on the signature request — shows exact error per signer

### Real-World Tester Feedback (April 2026)

- ElFuma + Matt: first external testers, found 4 bugs (all fixed)
- Charset issue: Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Russian, Turkish characters fail with ISO-8859-1 default. Fix: `<meta charset="utf-8"/>` in HTML output. RTL layout already supported.
- Google Docs DOCX export uses different XML structure than Microsoft Word — not yet supported. Future enhancement.

## Font Support

### PDF output
`Blob.toPdf()` uses Salesforce's Flying Saucer rendering engine which only supports 4 built-in font families:
- **Helvetica** (`sans-serif`) — the default
- **Times** (`serif`)
- **Courier** (`monospace`)
- **Arial Unicode MS** — for CJK/multibyte characters

Custom fonts **cannot** be loaded into the PDF engine. CSS `@font-face` is not supported — not via data URIs, static resource URLs, or ContentVersion URLs. This is a Salesforce platform limitation, not a DocGen limitation. Paid tools like Nintex and Conga work around this by using their own rendering engines outside of Salesforce.

**Do NOT re-add custom font upload for PDF.** It was built, tested exhaustively (base64 data URIs, static resource URLs, ContentVersion URLs), and confirmed not possible.

### DOCX output
DOCX output preserves whatever fonts are in the template file. If users need custom fonts (branded typefaces, barcode fonts, decorative scripts), they should generate as DOCX. The fonts render correctly when opened in Word or any compatible viewer.

## Scratch Orgs

- **docgen-test-ux**: Development and testing scratch org
- **docgen-demo-v2**: Public demo org (SSO via landing page, 30-day expiry)
- Create new scratch orgs from `Portwood Global - Production` DevHub

## Release Validation Checklist

**All three checks MUST pass before every release. No exceptions.**

### 1. E2E Test Suite (8 chained scripts)
```bash
sf apex run --target-org <org> -f scripts/e2e-01-permissions.apex
sf apex run --target-org <org> -f scripts/e2e-02-template-crud.apex
sf apex run --target-org <org> -f scripts/e2e-03-generate-pdf.apex
sf apex run --target-org <org> -f scripts/e2e-04-generate-docx.apex
sf apex run --target-org <org> -f scripts/e2e-05-generate-bulk.apex
sf apex run --target-org <org> -f scripts/e2e-06-signatures.apex
sf apex run --target-org <org> -f scripts/e2e-07-syntax.apex
sf apex run --target-org <org> -f scripts/e2e-08-cleanup.apex
```
Expected: Each script prints `PASS: N  FAIL: 0  ALL TESTS PASSED`

Scripts run in sequence: 01 is standalone, 02 creates test data, 03-06 depend on 02, 07 is standalone (uses processXmlForTest), 08 cleans up everything.

**MANDATORY: When adding ANY feature, field, merge tag, or configuration:**
1. Add assertions to the appropriate e2e script FIRST — before or alongside the feature code
2. Script domain mapping:
   - `e2e-01-permissions` — new Apex classes, VF pages, custom objects, field permissions
   - `e2e-02-template-crud` — template creation, version management, data retrieval
   - `e2e-03-generate-pdf` — PDF generation, output verification
   - `e2e-04-generate-docx` — DOCX generation, ZIP validation, client-side assembly
   - `e2e-05-generate-bulk` — bulk jobs, saved queries, job analysis
   - `e2e-06-signatures` — signature requests, PIN flow, settings, verification
   - `e2e-07-syntax` — ALL merge tag types via processXmlForTest()
   - `e2e-08-cleanup` — add delete statements for any new custom objects
3. Every new merge tag syntax must have a processXmlForTest() assertion in e2e-07
4. Every new custom field must be verified in the permission set validation in e2e-01
5. Every new Apex class must be added to the permission set checks in e2e-01
6. Every new VF page must be verified in the guest permission set checks in e2e-01
7. Each script must stay under 18,000 characters (Anonymous Apex limit is 20,000)

### 2. Apex Test Suite (850+ tests, 75% coverage)
```bash
sf apex run test --target-org <org> --test-level RunLocalTests --wait 15 --code-coverage
```
Expected: `Outcome: Passed`, `Pass Rate: 100%`, org-wide coverage ≥ 75%

### 3. Code Analyzer — Security + AppExchange (0 violations)
```bash
sf code-analyzer run --workspace "force-app/" --rule-selector "Security" --rule-selector "AppExchange" --view table
```
Expected: `0 High severity violation(s) found.` (30 Moderate false positives are acceptable — see `code-analyzer.yml`)

Runs PMD security rules, AppExchange-specific rules, and Salesforce Graph Engine (SFGE) taint analysis. SFGE timeouts on complex methods are normal — only violations count.

**If any check fails, the change doesn't ship.**

## Query Config Formats

Three formats, all stored in `Query_Config__c` (32KB LongTextArea):

### V1 — Legacy flat string
```
Name, Industry, (SELECT FirstName, LastName FROM Contacts)
```
Detected by: does NOT start with `{`. Parsed by the original `getRecordData()` method.

### V2 — JSON flat (junction support)
```json
{"v":2,"baseObject":"Opportunity","baseFields":["Name"],"parentFields":["Account.Name"],
 "children":[{"rel":"OpportunityLineItems","fields":["Name"]}],
 "junctions":[{"junctionRel":"OpportunityContactRoles","targetObject":"Contact","targetIdField":"ContactId","targetFields":["FirstName"]}]}
```
Detected by: starts with `{`, `"v":2`. Parsed by `getRecordDataV2()`.

### V3 — Query tree (multi-object, any depth)
```json
{"v":3,"root":"Account","nodes":[
  {"id":"n0","object":"Account","fields":["Name"],"parentFields":["Owner.Name"],"parentNode":null,"lookupField":null,"relationshipName":null},
  {"id":"n1","object":"Contact","fields":["FirstName"],"parentFields":[],"parentNode":"n0","lookupField":"AccountId","relationshipName":"Contacts"},
  {"id":"n2","object":"Opportunity","fields":["Name","Amount"],"parentFields":[],"parentNode":"n0","lookupField":"AccountId","relationshipName":"Opportunities"},
  {"id":"n3","object":"OpportunityLineItem","fields":["Quantity"],"parentFields":["Product2.Name"],"parentNode":"n2","lookupField":"OpportunityId","relationshipName":"OpportunityLineItems"}
]}
```
Detected by: starts with `{`, `"v":3`. Parsed by `getRecordDataV3()` tree walker. Each node is one SOQL query, stitched into parent's data map via `lookupField`.

**Backward compat:** All three formats work. The DataRetriever auto-detects the format and routes to the correct parser.

## Command Hub Architecture

The DocGen app has 2 tabs: "DocGen" (Command Hub) and "Job History".

The Command Hub (`docGenCommandHub` LWC) contains:
- Welcome banner (< 10 templates, dismissible)
- Quick action cards (Templates, Bulk Generate, How It Works)
- Embedded template manager (`docGenAdmin`)
- Embedded bulk runner (`docGenBulkRunner`, collapsible)
- Help section with merge tag cheat sheet, heap architecture explanation, Flow integration

The template wizard uses `docGenColumnBuilder` for the query builder step (tab-per-object layout with tree visualization). The old `docGenQueryBuilder` is still available via Manual Query toggle for legacy configs.

## Font Support

### PDF output
`Blob.toPdf()` only supports 4 built-in fonts: Helvetica (`sans-serif`), Times (`serif`), Courier (`monospace`), Arial Unicode MS. CSS `@font-face` is NOT supported. **Do NOT re-add custom font upload for PDF.**

### DOCX output
Preserves whatever fonts are in the template file.

## AppExchange

DocGen is NOT on the AppExchange. Do not reference AppExchange in user-facing documentation (admin guide, README). Code comments saying "AppExchange safe" (meaning no callouts/session IDs) are fine.
