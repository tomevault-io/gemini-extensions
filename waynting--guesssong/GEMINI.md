# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

Longer-form reference lives in [`docs/`](docs/README.md): [architecture](docs/architecture.md) (the system in diagrams), [viral-loop](docs/viral-loop.md) (the loop and how to read `npm run stats`), [operations](docs/operations.md) (deploys and what to do when something breaks), and [decisions](docs/decisions.md) (why it is like this, and what was rejected). This file stays the place for invariants and hazards — rules you must not undo. `docs/` is the place for explanation.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev        # Start dev server on port 8000 (http://127.0.0.1:8000)
npm run build      # Production build
npm run start      # Start production server
npm run lint       # Run ESLint
npm test           # Run vitest suite (tests/)
npm run stats      # Print the viral-loop counters (needs the Upstash env vars)
```

Use `127.0.0.1:8000` (not `localhost`) — the Spotify app is configured for this origin.

**Run `npm run stats` at the start of any session about growth, the loop, retention, or "what should we build next", and lead with what it says.** Not a nicety. The product's own telemetry went unread for eight weeks across four separate attempts to go and open GA4, and every feature decision in that period was made on an n of 1. The counters exist so that question has an answer; a command nobody runs is the same failure with a shorter path. If the Upstash variables are missing, say so and ask for them rather than reasoning from guesses.

**Read `docs/viral-loop.md` before interpreting the output.** Every number it prints is a floor, and the failure mode is reading a low one as "the CTA does not work" rather than "we could not see that it did".

## What This Is

**GuessSong** — a local party music guessing game built on **Next.js 15 App Router**. The host pastes a public Spotify playlist URL, adds player names, and plays short audio clips; everyone guesses out loud and the host awards points. **No login and no user accounts** — a single game's state lives in React state, handed off between pages via `sessionStorage`.

There *is* server-side storage, but it is deliberately narrow: a KV layer (`lib/kv.ts`) backed by Upstash Redis, used only for short-lived, TTL'd data — Mixed Playlist Mode's rooms (`lib/room.ts`) and IP rate limiting (`lib/rate-limit.ts`). Nothing is persisted per-user, and there are no tables or migrations. Local dev and tests fall back to an in-process `Map`, so neither needs a real Redis.

## Architecture

### Data Flow

1. **Setup** (`app/page.tsx`) — collects playlist URL, player names, clip duration (5–30s). On Start, calls `POST /api/playlist`, shuffles the returned tracks, writes the whole game payload to `sessionStorage` under the key `guesssong_game`, then navigates to `/game`.
2. **Game** (`app/game/page.tsx`, ~1200 lines, the heart of the app) — reads `guesssong_game` from sessionStorage on mount (redirects to `/` if absent) and runs a phase state machine:
   `waiting → playing → guessing → revealed → (next track | finished)`
3. **Audio previews** — Spotify deprecated `preview_url` (Nov 2024) and now returns `null` for *every* track on Client Credentials — measured 0/20 across four markets, which is why `Track` carries no `previewUrl` field at all. Every clip the game plays comes from iTunes or Deezer, resolved through `lib/preview-client.ts`. On mount it prefetches the whole game with one `POST /api/preview/batch`; anything that comes back unresolved falls back to `GET /api/preview` lazily, at the moment the host presses Play. Both search the **iTunes Search API** first and fall back to **Deezer**. Settled results are cached per track id in a ref (`previewCache`); tracks with no clip anywhere show a "no audio" state.

### API Routes (the only server code)

| Route | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `POST /api/playlist` | `{url}` → playlist name + tracks, via Spotify **Client Credentials** flow (`lib/spotify.ts`). Rejects Spotify editorial playlists (IDs starting `37i9` return 404 for new apps). |
| `GET /api/preview` | Track/artist/id → 30s preview URL (iTunes, then Deezer). No auth required. KV-cached by track id, including negative results. `&refresh=1` re-resolves a URL that stopped playing, on its own much tighter limit. |
| `POST /api/preview/batch` | `{tracks:[{id,name,artist}]}` → the same lookup for a whole game in one request. |
| `POST /api/room` | Creates a Mixed Playlist Mode room; returns room code, host token, expiry. |
| `POST /api/room/[code]/submit` | A player submits their playlist URL to the room. |
| `GET /api/room/[code]/status` | Poll for who has submitted so far. |
| `GET /api/room/[code]/pool` | Host consumes the room and gets the sampled, deduped track pool. |

**A room is a Redis hash, and its writers claim a field rather than rewriting the record.** `lib/room.ts` stores `meta`, `consumed` and one `p:<folded name>` per contributor under `room:v2:<CODE>`, with each contributor's tracks in their own `room:v2:<CODE>:t:<folded name>` key. Four rules hold it together, and each replaces something that was actively wrong:

- **The claim is `hsetnx`, and there is no retry loop.** Read-modify-write on one blob cannot be made safe with get/set: the old code re-read before writing and read again afterwards to detect a clobber, which narrowed the window without closing it and cost four commands on the happy path. A QR room is a dozen phones submitting inside a few seconds, so this is the ordinary case.
- **`hsetnx` must not touch the key's TTL.** Redis leaves a TTL alone on a field write; a caller that "helpfully" re-set it on each submit would push the room past the `expiresAt` it already handed its clients, which is the same value the roster poll uses as its stop condition. `createRoom` calls `expire` once, and deletes the key if that call fails rather than leaking an immortal code.
- **Track payloads must stay out of the hash.** The roster poll runs every few seconds and needs names and counts; the blob made it drag every contributor's full track list across the wire to render a dozen chips. `consumeRoomPool` picks the track keys up with one `mget`, once.
- **`fold()` is the only place a name becomes a key.** It keys both the hash field and the tracks key, so a second spelling of the fold would let someone hold a roster slot under one key and write their tracks under another — visible in the room, absent from the pool.

The size cap is enforced at the pre-fetch check only. Re-enforcing it after the claim would mean rolling back a winner because a simultaneous submit pushed the count over, i.e. turning away someone who did arrive in time; the alternative it guards against is a room of thirteen instead of twelve.

**Every route is IP rate limited** via `lib/rate-limit.ts` (fixed window on top of `lib/kv.ts`'s atomic `incr`). When adding a route, follow the existing pattern: module-level `X_LIMIT` / `X_WINDOW_SECONDS` constants, then `rateLimit()` → 429 before any expensive work.

**`rateLimit` must fail open, and it is the one KV consumer where that reads backwards.** A limiter looks like the place to fail *closed*, and that reading took the whole site down: `enforceRateLimit` runs at the top of all seven routes *before* their own `try`/`catch`, so a throwing `incr` escaped the handler and Next answered a bare 500 with an empty body — no `code`, so hosts were told to check a playlist URL that was fine. The trigger was Upstash's monthly command cap being spent, which fails every command for days rather than seconds. Giving up the per-IP ceiling is the cheap half of the trade: the limits mostly blunt guessing against `lib/room.ts`'s 4-char code space, and rooms live in the same KV that is already gone. Spotify and iTunes keep their own ceilings in `lib/playlist-cache.ts` / `lib/preview-cache.ts`. Symptom and what still degrades: `docs/operations.md` §5.

Three caches keep upstream request volume flat as traffic grows:
- **Preview cache** (`lib/preview-cache.ts`) — KV, keyed by track id. Caching misses is the point: tracks with no preview anywhere are the most repeatedly queried, and each uncached miss costs 5 upstream calls. See "Previews are per-track" below, which is the whole reason this is the hottest path in the app.
- **Playlist cache** (`lib/playlist-cache.ts`) — KV, keyed by playlist id. 6h on a full playlist, 1h on a sampled one. **Every caller must go through `loadPlaylist`, never `getPlaylistWithTracks` directly** — a single uncached path is enough to put the shared quota back at risk.
- **Spotify token cache** (`lib/spotify.ts`) — module scope, so per-lambda-instance rather than global. Deliberately *not* in KV: a token is the one thing with no fallback, so a KV outage on that path would take down playlist loading entirely. A 401 clears the cache and retries once.

### Spotify's quota is per app, not per IP

This is the constraint the whole playlist path is shaped around, and it is the opposite of how `lib/rate-limit.ts` works. Spotify throttles on the **client id**, so every visitor shares one budget, while every route limiter is keyed by IP and hands each new visitor a fresh allowance. Per-IP limits bound one abusive client; they do nothing about aggregate load. `lib/playlist-cache.ts` is what bounds the aggregate, in three layers:

- **Cache** — a repeat playlist costs zero upstream calls.
- **In-flight coalescing** — concurrent loads of the same playlist collapse into one fetch, per lambda instance. Mixed mode fires one request per contributor from one click, and a QR room gets a burst of simultaneous submits; the cache write lands too late to help those siblings.
- **Global budget** (`SPOTIFY_MAX_LOADS_PER_MINUTE`) — a KV `incr` counter shared across instances, refusing new playlists *before* Spotify does. Fails open on a KV error: losing the safety net must mean "back to how it was", not "nobody can play".
- **429 cooldown** — when Spotify does refuse, all uncached loads are parked for `Retry-After` (clamped 30s–15min), in KV so every instance sees it. Without this a throttled window is self-sustaining: every host errors, every host retries, the retries keep the quota pinned. Cached playlists keep serving throughout, so a party mid-game is unaffected by someone else's throttling.

Two rules that follow from this, and are easy to undo by accident:
- **Never flatten an upstream 429 into a generic 400.** The client has to be able to tell "your playlist is wrong" from "we are throttled" — the original bug told throttled hosts to check their URL was public, which sent them straight back into retrying.
- **`fetchPlaylistTracks` reads at most `MAX_PLAYLIST_TRACKS` (500), sampling random pages when a playlist is bigger.** Following `next` unbounded made one big playlist cost 40+ requests for a game that plays at most 50 songs. A miss logs `[playlist-cache] miss id=… source=… misses=…`; the cumulative rate is `getCacheStats()`, on demand.

Two things about reading that line, both of which have already cost a debugging detour:
- **Trust `source=`, not the log row's method.** Only `POST /api/playlist` and `POST /api/room/[code]/submit` can produce it, but Vercel attributes a line to whichever request the instance was serving, so it often appears against an unrelated `GET`. New callers of `loadPlaylist` should pass a `PlaylistLoadSource`; the default logs `source=unknown`.
- **`getCacheStats()` counts a replayed 404 as a hit** — correctly, since it answered without touching Spotify — so a host retrying a dead link pushes the rate *up*. `negativeHits` is that subset, and `hits - negativeHits` is the part that describes real playlists. The bucket is a **UTC** day, so a rate read soon after 00:00 UTC is measuring almost nothing.
- **A log line must not read a counter back to compose itself.** Both cache modules used to spend two extra KV reads per miss printing a cumulative rate, on the exact path that is already the expensive one. Cumulative numbers belong in `npm run stats` and the `*CacheStats()` accessors, which are asked once by someone who wants them; a log line reports the request it belongs to.

### Previews are per-track, which makes them the hotter path

`lib/preview-cache.ts` is the same shape of problem as the section above, an order of magnitude worse. Spotify is called once per *playlist*; iTunes and Deezer are called once per *track*, so a cold 50-song game is 50 lookups of up to 5 upstream calls each. Both throttle per IP, and a serverless deploy's egress IPs are shared — from iTunes' side the entire user base is one very noisy client. Per-IP limiting does nothing about it, for the reason spelled out above.

The same three layers, so they read the same way: cache → global budget (`PREVIEW_MAX_LOOKUPS_PER_MINUTE`, counted in *lookups*) → per-source cooldown, all fail-open, all in KV so every instance sees them. `[preview-cache] miss hits=… misses=… unavailable=…` describes that request; `getPreviewCacheStats()` has the day's totals.

**The cooldown is memoized in module scope, and it must not go back to a KV read per track.** It is a site-wide, minute-scale signal that `askUpstream` consults once per source *per track*, so a cold 25-song game spent up to 50 reads learning the same two answers — more commands than the batch's own writes. A known-future `until` is trusted without re-reading at all; "not cooling" is held only `COOLDOWN_MEMO_MS`, because that is the answer that spends upstream calls, and the in-flight map is what makes the first wave of a batch share one read instead of each worker issuing its own. `startCooldown` primes the memo, so within an instance a 403 parks the source immediately; across instances a cooldown is joined up to `COOLDOWN_MEMO_MS` late, which is deliberately far below `MIN_COOLDOWN_SECONDS`.

Four things here are easy to undo by accident:

- **The title-only queries verify the artist; the ones that carried it upstream must not.** Each source is asked progressively looser questions and the last drops the artist, so upstream ranks by popularity alone and returns the best-known song with that title — iTunes answers "Hello" with Pinkfong's nursery rhyme and "Alone" with Heart. Accepting one caches the wrong recording as `found` for a year, which refresh never re-picks, and the clip then contradicts the answer card. Those queries require the candidate to be tied to the request by *either* a matching credit or a matching running time, and otherwise hand over to the next source. Applying the same check to the artist-carrying queries looks like an obvious tightening and is a catalogue-wide outage for CJK: iTunes returns 小幸運 as "A Little Happiness" by "Hebe Tien" where Spotify says 田馥甄. `artistMatches` is only ever a veto where upstream had no artist signal of its own.

- **`absent` and `unavailable` are not the same null, and collapsing them is a real bug that shipped.** `absent` is a fact about the recording — nothing has a clip — and is cached a week. `unavailable` is a fact about *us*: throttled, out of budget, or the request never got through. The old route mapped every failure onto `previewUrl: null` and cached it for seven days, so one throttled minute at peak marked a slice of the catalogue silent for a week, and it never reproduced locally because a laptop's own IP is never the one being throttled. Only a clean, complete reply from upstream may produce `absent`; everything else is `unavailable`, cached 90 seconds. A wrong `absent` lasts a week and is invisible, a wrong `unavailable` costs one retry. **The client half has the same rule** (`lib/preview-client.ts`, and `previewCache` in the game page stores settled answers only).
- **iTunes signals throttling with `403`, not 429, and Deezer puts its quota error in the body of a `200`.** Reading only 429, or only the status, is how a refusal gets classified as "no result" in the first place.
- **The cache key is deliberately unversioned**, unlike `lib/playlist-cache.ts`'s. The record is a strict superset of the `{previewUrl}` shape that shipped before it, so legacy entries still read as valid hits. Bumping a version would cold-start every entry in production simultaneously — precisely the upstream burst the module exists to prevent. For the same reason, legacy nulls are read as `absent` even though some are poisoned by the old bug: they age out within a week, and re-resolving all of them at once is the stampede that poisoned them.

Positive entries are held a year, because a recording does not change. What does change is the URL — the clips sit on a CDN that rotates them — so the entry has to be *repairable* rather than merely expiring: the stored `itunesTrackId` lets `&refresh=1` re-resolve with one `lookup?id=` call instead of the five-call search fan-out, and the game page fires it from the `<audio>` element's `error` event, once per track. Drop the refresh path and the year-long TTL becomes a year of dead URLs.

### Scoring

The host is the judge — there is no automated answer checking. Correct song guess = host taps the player → **+3 pts**; album name = **+1 pt**. One award of each type per round, guarded by `pointsAwarded` / `albumPointsAwarded` flags.

### SEO / Metadata

Production domain is `https://www.guessong.app` (fallback in `app/layout.tsx`, `app/sitemap.ts`, `app/robots.ts`). `app/layout.tsx` also injects GA4 when `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID` is set.

**AdSense's loader lives in `app/layout.tsx`'s `<head>`, not in a `next/script`.** Google's site review looks for it there, and `afterInteractive` would inject it into the body instead. It renders only when `NODE_ENV === "production"`, so `next dev` never reports impressions against the account. `public/ads.txt` carries the same publisher id with the `ca-` prefix stripped — AdSense flags "Earnings at risk" if the file is missing or the two disagree, so changing `NEXT_PUBLIC_ADSENSE_CLIENT_ID` means changing both.

**The five generated images must stay build-time, which means none of them may declare `runtime = "edge"`.** `app/opengraph-image.tsx`, `app/icon.tsx` and the three sizes of `app/icons/[size]` are rasterised by satori, the most CPU-expensive thing the app does. All three carried `runtime = "edge"` from the day they were written until this was found, and edge *disables static generation for the route* — Next says so in a build warning that is easy to read past ("Using edge runtime on a page currently disables static generation for that page"). They were `ƒ` in the route table, ran per request as `edge-function`, and showed up in production logs as `cache: MISS`. The fix was deleting three lines; the output bytes are identical either way, so nothing about this is visible on the page and nothing but the route table will tell you it regressed. `app/icons/[size]` additionally needs its `generateStaticParams` + `dynamicParams = false` to stay — that pair is what prerenders the three sizes and 404s everything else without an invocation.

After touching any of them, check `npm run build`'s route table: `/icon` and `/opengraph-image` must be `○`, `/icons/[size]` must be `●` with all three sizes listed under it. An `ƒ` there is the regression.

## Environment Variables

```
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID / SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET   # Required — Client Credentials only, no redirect URI
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL / _TOKEN             # Required in production — see below
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL                        # Optional — defaults to https://www.guessong.app
NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID               # Optional — enables GA4
NEXT_PUBLIC_ADSENSE_CLIENT_ID               # Optional — AdSense publisher id, defaults to ca-pub-2238954049312975
SPOTIFY_MAX_LOADS_PER_MINUTE                # Optional — global upstream ceiling, default 40
PREVIEW_MAX_LOOKUPS_PER_MINUTE              # Optional — global iTunes/Deezer ceiling, default 120
```

Without the Upstash pair, `lib/kv.ts` falls back to an in-process `Map`. That is fine for `next dev` and tests, but **not** for multi-instance serverless deploys: rooms created by one lambda would be invisible to another, rate limit counters would reset per instance, and the preview cache would lose most of its hit rate.

## Release Notes — two changelogs, both hand-written

A release updates **both** of these, and they are not the same document:

- `CHANGELOG.md` — the maintainer's record. Technical, names files and functions, carries a "Known gaps" todo list.
- `lib/changelog.ts` — what players read in the footer's "What's new" overlay (`components/changelog-modal.tsx`, on `/`, `/about`, `/zh`). Plain language, and **bilingual**: every entry needs `text` *and* `textZh`, plus `headline` and `headlineZh`. `/zh` is written natively rather than translated, so an English string leaking through there is a visible defect, not a fallback.

`tests/changelog.test.ts` enforces what it can: newest-first ordering, both languages present and different, valid dates, no markdown, and `LATEST_VERSION === package.json`'s version. That last one means **bumping `package.json` without adding an entry to `lib/changelog.ts` fails the suite** — deliberately, because the overlay prints that version to users and `changelog_opened` files reads under it.

## Error messages — codes, not sentences

`lib/error-messages.ts` is the only place a user-visible error string exists: one `AppErrorCode` union and one `Record<AppErrorCode, {en, zh}>` table, so a missing translation is a compile error. Add an error by adding a code, never by writing a sentence at the throw site.

**The server sends `{ error, code }` and the client picks the language.** Routes build that with `errorResponse` (`lib/api-error.ts`); `SpotifyApiError`, `RoomError` and `BuzzerUnavailableError` are constructed from a code, and their `message` is the English rendering — it is for `console.error`, never for the UI. Localising server-side would be wrong three ways: one room is read by several devices, `/api/playlist` is called on behalf of other people's phones in Mixed mode, and `lib/playlist-cache.ts` caches 404s, which would freeze one language into the cache for everyone.

Clients render with `errorMessage` / `describeError` and get the locale from `useErrorLocale()` (device language, resolved in an effect so the server-rendered join pages don't hydrate against a different string). `apiError(body, fallbackCode)` turns a failed response into an `AppError`; the fallback should name what the caller was doing, not `unknown`.

Three things `tests/error-messages.test.ts` will catch, all easy to do by accident:
- **A placeholder only exists if its callers pass params.** `{seconds}` with no `params` renders literally at the player, so the test pins the exact set of codes allowed to have one.
- **No throttling message may blame the host's playlist**, in *either* language. That is the `spotify_*` hazard documented above, and a translation is just as capable of reintroducing it.
- **No throttling code may join `isDeterministicPlaylistFailure`.** That predicate names the codes where resubmitting the identical URL provably cannot answer differently — the URL is malformed, or `lib/playlist-cache.ts` is replaying a 404 it will keep replaying for `NOT_FOUND_TTL_SECONDS`. `app/page.tsx` uses it to re-show the error the host already has instead of spending a request to be told it again, keyed on the exact URL string so editing the link needs no explicit reset. This is the same `spotify_*` hazard one step further on: a spent quota clears by itself, so listing a throttling code there would strand a host whose playlist was always fine behind a button that has quietly stopped asking. `playlist_load_failed`, `unknown` and `server_error` stay out for the mirror-image reason — "we don't know" must not harden into "don't ask".

  Why it exists: a refused playlist returns from the negative cache in ~100ms, which is faster than the Start button re-enables, so a host mashing Start on a private link generated bursts of fourteen identical `POST /api/playlist` calls 150–300ms apart. In a two-minute production log sample those 404s were **78% of all billed function invocations** — the single largest consumer of the Vercel Active-CPU budget, well ahead of anything doing real work. Nothing upstream was being hit; the cost was the invocations themselves, which is exactly the class of waste a per-IP rate limit does not catch (the bursts sat comfortably inside the 30-per-10-minute allowance).

The buzzer Worker keeps its own wire codes (`BuzzerErrorCode` in `lib/buzzer-protocol.ts`, which is shared verbatim with the Worker and must stay dependency-free). `BUZZER_ERROR_CODES` maps them onto app codes — that mapping is the only thing connecting the two, so a new wire code needs an entry there.

## Analytics

`lib/analytics.ts` is the only place GA4 events are declared: one `AnalyticsEvent` union locking every event name to its param shape, and `trackEvent()`, which no-ops outside production (logging to `console.debug` instead) and when `window.gtag` is missing. Add an event by extending the union — never call `window.gtag` directly.

Two conventions worth keeping:

- **Failure params are bucketed enums, never raw error messages.** Messages come from upstream APIs and from pasted playlist URLs, so forwarding them would blow up GA4's param cardinality and could carry user input into analytics.
- **Every funnel needs a denominator.** `room_join_opened` exists so a QR code that people scan but fail to get through is distinguishable from one nobody scanned. Pure helpers that shape params (e.g. `roomJobs()`) live here rather than in the calling component, because the test suite only reaches `lib/`.

New params do not appear in GA4 reports until they are registered as custom dimensions (Admin → Custom definitions, scope **Event**), and registration is not retroactive.

### The loop counters are a second, deliberate copy

Everything about the viral loop is recorded twice: once in GA4 through `trackEvent`, and once in KV through `lib/loop-stats.ts` (written by `app/r/[surface]` and `app/api/pulse`, read by `npm run stats`). This is not redundancy to clean up.

**KV is authoritative for any decision.** GA4 is for cohorting and for questions nobody has asked yet. The two will disagree — an ad blocker kills the GA4 event and not the redirect, a spent rate-limit window drops the KV increment and not the GA4 event — and the gap between them is itself a reading of how much of this audience blocks analytics. The reason the second copy exists at all is that GA4 requires someone to go and look, and the measured rate at which that happens here is zero.

Three things in that path are easy to undo by accident:

- **The loop link must stay a real navigation to `/r/[surface]`.** Replacing it with a click handler that reports and then routes loses the click it is measuring: browsers cancel in-flight requests as a document tears down, and this fires on the click that leaves the page. That is also why it is a plain `<a>` and not `next/link` — prefetching a counting endpoint invents hits — and why `/r` is in `app/robots.ts`'s disallow list.
- **`/r/[surface]` must redirect on every branch.** Unknown segment, spent limiter, KV unavailable: the visitor still reaches `/`, and only the count is lost. The person clicking is precisely the person the loop exists to reach.
- **Counters carry a liveness marker and are held 30 days, not the 7 the cache stats use.** `mget` returns null for a key that was never written, which is indistinguishable from a genuine zero, and "the CTA does nothing" is the most important negative result available here — without the marker it would render as "no data yet" forever. The 30 days is because a report that looks a week back would otherwise expire its own oldest day. **The marker is written once per instance per UTC day, not once per metric** — its reader only asks whether the count is above zero, so every write after the first doubled the cost of the whole namespace for an answer already in KV. It is recorded as written only after the write succeeds, so one unlucky request cannot cost the day its liveness.

- **The roster poll backs off, and `pollIntervalMs` is where that lives.** A flat interval spent the same 30 commands a minute on a lobby nobody has touched as on one filling up, and the second case is the common one — 450 ticks over a room's TTL for a roster that stopped changing in minute two. Every arrival resets the ladder to `ROOM_POLL_INTERVAL_MS`, so an active room polls exactly as fast as it always did; only silence is cheap. Keep the rule in `lib/room-poll.ts`: in the component nothing can test it, and this is the rule that decides the bill.

Every surface name is declared once in `lib/loop-links.ts` and derived from there by the link, the analytics param, and the server-side validator. Hand-syncing those three fails silently: a stale validator still redirects, the counter just stops, and that arm reads as "nobody clicked it".

## Styling Conventions

- Dark aesthetic: background `#111`, cards `#1a1a1a`, Spotify green `#1DB954` accents
- Fonts: Bebas Neue (display) + Outfit (body), loaded via inline `<style>` in the pages
- The setup and game pages use **inline styles and `<style>` blocks**, not Tailwind classes — match this when editing them. Tailwind + shadcn/ui (`components/ui/`: button, card, input, label) are used elsewhere.

## Types

`types/index.ts` contains only the `Track` interface — the shape stored in sessionStorage and returned by `/api/playlist`. Shared game types (`GamePayload`, `GamePlayer`, `GameMode`) live in `lib/game-session.ts`; room types and constants (`ROOM_TTL_SECONDS`, `ROOM_MAX_SUBMISSIONS`) live in `types/room.ts`; preview wire types and `PREVIEW_BATCH_MAX` live in `types/preview.ts`, kept out of `lib/preview-cache.ts` so the browser bundle doesn't pull in `lib/kv.ts` and the Upstash client; the game page defines its own local `Phase` type.

When adding a value to a union that `parseGamePayload` reads, extend that union's allow-list array alongside it (`GAME_MODES`, `PLAYLIST_SOURCES`). Both lines are guards rather than ternaries precisely so a forgotten entry is a value that reads back as the default instead of a member that silently changes behaviour.

**The same fallback is what makes retiring a value safe, and it is the only reason removing one is not a breaking change.** `mode: "trial"` and `playlistSource: "builtin"` were deleted in 1.5.0, and a game sitting in a host's sessionStorage at deploy time still had them. Because the guard falls through to `"party"` / `"own"` rather than rejecting the payload, that game keeps playing instead of failing to parse and bouncing the host to `/` mid-party. `tests/game-session.test.ts` pins it. Anything that "tightens" these guards into rejecting unknown values breaks every in-flight game on every deploy that touches a union.

## Number of Songs

`lib/song-count.ts` holds the control's whole state machine, in `lib/` rather than `app/page.tsx` because the suite only reaches `lib/`. `SongCountState` is `{count, field}` — the count is the answer, the field is what has been typed, and they are separate because a number input passes through states that are not yet a count.

**`typeCustom` rejects out-of-range input and `commitCustom` clamps it. That asymmetry is deliberate and collapsing it reintroduces a shipped bug.** Rejecting per keystroke is what stops a half-typed "150" from committing 1 and then 15. Clamping on blur is what stops the field from being left showing 99 after the host typed 999 — the last in-range prefix, a number nobody typed, from a rule nothing on screen states. One rule for both events gets one of those two wrong.

## Skill routing

When the user's request matches an available skill, invoke it via the Skill tool. When in doubt, invoke the skill.

Key routing rules:
- Product ideas/brainstorming → invoke /office-hours
- Strategy/scope → invoke /plan-ceo-review
- Architecture → invoke /plan-eng-review
- Design system/plan review → invoke /design-consultation or /plan-design-review
- Full review pipeline → invoke /autoplan
- Bugs/errors → invoke /investigate
- QA/testing site behavior → invoke /qa or /qa-only
- Code review/diff check → invoke /review
- Visual polish → invoke /design-review
- Ship/deploy/PR → invoke /ship or /land-and-deploy
- Save progress → invoke /context-save
- Resume context → invoke /context-restore
- Author a backlog-ready spec/issue → invoke /spec
