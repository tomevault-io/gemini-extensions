# AGENTS.md

This document is the project-specific operating manual for AI coding agents working in `govard`.

## 1. Mission and Product Context

`Govard` is a Go-based local development orchestrator for PHP and web projects (Magento, Laravel, Symfony, WordPress, etc.), with:

- CLI orchestration (`govard ...`)
- Container runtime automation (Docker)
- Blueprint/template rendering
- Remote environment tooling
- SSL/proxy utilities
- Wails-based Desktop GUI Application (`govard desktop`)

Primary goals for contributions:

1. Preserve CLI stability and predictable behavior.
2. Keep workflows fast for local developers.
3. Avoid regressions in core command families (bootstrap/proxy/db/sync/remote/lock/domain/desktop).
4. Maintain UI reliability and backend bridge logic for the Desktop App.
5. Maintain release quality (GoReleaser, checksums, install paths).

## 2. Runtime and Toolchain Requirements

- Go: `1.25+` (module uses `go 1.25.0`)
- Node.js: `20` (for frontend UI and frontend tests)
- Wails: `v2.11+` (for desktop app development)
- Docker: required for integration tests and runtime orchestration
- GitHub CLI (`gh`): useful for release inspection (optional)

Local sanity checks:

```bash
go version # If not in PATH, check /home/$USER/go_dist/go/bin/go
node --version
wails version
docker --version
```

## 3. Repository Map

- `cmd/govard/main.go`: CLI entrypoint
- `cmd/govard-desktop/`: Desktop app entrypoint (built by Wails)
- `desktop/`: Wails desktop app codebase (Go backend bridge + HTML/vanilla JS frontend in `desktop/frontend/`)
- `wiki/`: Project documentation (GitHub Wiki source files, synced automatically on push)
- `internal/cmd/`: Cobra command implementations
- `internal/engine/`: orchestration, config, blueprint logic
- `internal/engine/bootstrap/`: framework bootstrap workflows
- `internal/engine/remote/`: remote sync/deploy/ssh helpers
- `internal/proxy/`: caddy/proxy route and TLS helpers
- `internal/updater/`: update-check notification logic
- `internal/ui/`: terminal rendering helpers
- `tests/`: unit/contract tests (default location for tests)
- `tests/integration/`: integration tests (tagged and heavier)
- `tests/frontend/`: Node test runner suite for frontend pieces
- `install.sh`: unified installer (release binary by default, `--source` for source build)
- `scripts/build-macos-pkg.sh`: helper script to build macOS `.pkg` installer artifacts
- `.goreleaser.yml`: release artifact config
- `.github/workflows/`: CI/release/security automation

## 4. Core Build and Test Commands

Preferred commands:

```bash
make test                # lint + fmt-check + vet + frontend + unit + integration tests
make test-unit           # unit tests only
make test-integration    # integration tests (requires build + docker)

make vet                 # go vet
make fmt                 # go fmt ./...
make build               # build Govard for the current platform
```

Useful direct commands:

```bash
go test ./...
go test ./tests/... -v
go test -tags integration ./tests/integration/... -v -timeout 30m
```

## 5. CI and Quality Gates

Key workflows:

- `ci-pipeline.yml`: vet + gofmt check + fast tests + integration + binary build
- `release.yml`: triggered by tag `v*.*.*`, runs GoReleaser and uploads macOS `.pkg` installers
- `codeql.yml`: code scanning
- `govulncheck.yml`: weekly vulnerability scan

Do not assume local success if you skipped:

1. formatting (`gofmt -s -w` / `make fmt`)
2. tests relevant to changed surface
3. at least one command-level smoke check for CLI behavior changes

## 6. Testing Conventions (Important)

Project convention is to keep most tests in `tests/` package `tests`.

Test isolation and fixture hygiene rules:

- Keep tests hermetic: do not rely on the user's real projects, real containers, or machine-specific state.
- Do not use real/legacy project fixture names (for example `magento2-test-instance`); use neutral fixtures such as `sample-project`.
- Prefer mocks/fakes over live network dependencies in unit tests (for HTTP, inject client/transport and use a mock `RoundTripper`).
- Ensure test suites isolate state via temporary `GOVARD_HOME_DIR` (use `TestMain` setup where appropriate).
- If an integration test must touch external services, gate it with explicit env checks and clear skip reasons.

When you need to test internal logic from `internal/cmd` (or other internal packages):

1. keep production helpers unexported where possible
2. add narrow exported wrappers suffixed with `ForTest` (example: `BuildLocalDBResetScriptForTest`)
3. consume those wrappers from test files in `tests/`

Example pattern:

- production function: `buildThing(...)`
- test wrapper: `BuildThingForTest(...)`
- test location: `tests/thing_test.go`

Avoid broad export of internals just for tests.

## 7. CLI Architecture and Command Work

`internal/cmd/root.go` owns root registration and `Version` binding.

When adding/modifying a command:

1. define command in `internal/cmd/<area>.go`
2. register with `rootCmd.AddCommand(...)` (or relevant subcommand group)
3. ensure flags are explicit and help text is actionable
4. return errors with context (`fmt.Errorf("operation: %w", err)`)
5. add/adjust tests in `tests/`
6. update docs for user-visible command/flag changes

For update/release-sensitive commands:

- confirm asset naming matches `.goreleaser.yml`
- verify checksums where possible
- avoid assuming `sudo` availability

## 8. Installer and Update Expectations

### Release artifacts

Current release artifacts include:

- CLI archives from GoReleaser:
  - non-Windows: `govard_<version>_<OS>_<arch>.tar.gz`
  - Windows: `govard_<version>_<OS>_<arch>.zip`
- Linux installer (GoReleaser nfpm): `govard_<version>_linux_<arch>.deb`
  - includes both `govard` and `govard-desktop`
- macOS installer (release workflow): `govard_<version>_Darwin_<arch>.pkg`
  - includes both `govard` and `govard-desktop`
- Checksum file: `checksums.txt`

### Installer scripts

- `install.sh`: unified installer (download release binary by default, `--source` for source build)
- `scripts/build-macos-pkg.sh`: macOS package artifact builder used by release workflow

### Self-update behavior

`govard self-update` should:

1. resolve target version (explicit or latest)
2. resolve platform-specific artifact name
3. download archive and checksum
4. verify SHA-256
5. extract binary
6. atomically replace executable (or fail with clear permissions guidance)

## 9. Coding Standards

- Always run `gofmt` after Go edits.
- Keep code ASCII unless file already requires Unicode.
- Prefer small pure helpers for parsing/formatting logic.
- Keep platform branching explicit (`runtime.GOOS`, `runtime.GOARCH`).
- Do not swallow errors silently for critical flows (network, file, process).
- Preserve existing UX tone from `pterm` output and command help strings.

## 10. Dependency and Security Guidance

- Avoid adding dependencies unless required by measurable benefit.
- Prefer Go stdlib for HTTP, archive, hash, file operations.
- Never log secrets, tokens, private keys, or DB passwords.
- For remote/ssh/db commands, keep safe defaults and explicit opt-in for write ops.

## 11. Documentation Update Rules

Update `README.md` when changes affect:

1. installation
2. upgrade/update flow
3. command names/flags
4. release consumption

Update the canonical wiki pages in `wiki/` when changes affect:

1. command names, aliases, or flags
2. configuration behavior or layering
3. remote/sync/db workflows
4. framework support or runtime defaults
5. desktop behavior or desktop testing workflow

If behavior changed and wiki is stale, treat as incomplete work.

When documenting commands that accept remote filesystem paths:

- prefer absolute remote paths in shell examples (for example `/var/www/app`)
- if using remote-home shorthand, quote it (`'~/public_html'`) so the local shell does not expand it before Govard receives the flag

## 12. Git and Change Hygiene

- Keep commits focused by concern (installer, command logic, tests, docs).
- Do not revert unrelated working-tree changes.
- Avoid destructive git operations unless explicitly requested.
- Include test evidence in PR/hand-off notes.

## 13. Recommended Agent Workflow

1. Read impacted files and nearby tests.
2. Identify minimal change set.
3. Implement with small helpers and clear errors.
4. Add/adjust tests in `tests/`.
5. Run formatting and targeted tests.
6. Run broader suite as needed (`make test` or `go test ./...`).
7. Update `README.md` and the relevant canonical `wiki/*.md` files if user-facing behavior changed.
8. Summarize file-level changes and verification evidence.

## 14. Pre-Completion Checklist

Before declaring done:

1. `go test` on affected scope passes.
2. No formatting drift (`gofmt -s -l .` should be empty for changed Go files).
3. Command help/flags still coherent.
4. `README.md` and relevant canonical `wiki/*.md` files updated for user-visible changes.
5. `git status` reviewed for unintended file changes.

## 15. Known Project-Specific Notes

- CI tracks `main`, `master`, and `develop`.
- Default branch currently appears as `master` in this repo.
- Release tags follow semantic style `vX.Y.Z`.
- Integration tests rely on built binary (`bin/govard-test`) and Docker.

When uncertain, prefer compatibility and least-surprise behavior over broad refactors.

## 16. Desktop App Development & Testing

### Dev Mode (Live Backend)

To launch the desktop app with the real Go backend connecting to local Docker projects, run Wails dev mode. **Critically, in AI headless environments, provide a display server to prevent Wails from crashing:**

```bash
DISPLAY=:1 govard desktop --dev
```

This uses `wails dev -tags desktop` under the hood, compiling the backend and serving the frontend.

### Browser Access for UI Testing (Real Data)

When the dev server is successfully running (it may take 10-20 seconds to compile), it exposes the frontend at:

```
http://localhost:34115
```

This is the **mandatory approach for agents to test the real desktop UI**. 
- Navigate to `http://localhost:34115` in the browser tool.
- You will see live, actual projects from the user's Docker environment, not dummy templates.

| Path                                     | Purpose                                |
| :--------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------- |
| `desktop/frontend/index.html`            | Main HTML entry                        |
| `desktop/frontend/main.js`               | Bootstrap, event wiring, tab/state mgmt|
| `desktop/frontend/services/bridge.js`    | Wails Go backend RPC bridge            |
| `desktop/frontend/state/store.js`        | UI state (selected project, filters)   |
| `desktop/frontend/modules/`              | Feature modules (dashboard, logs, etc) |
| `desktop/frontend/ui/toast.js`           | Toast notification system              |
| `desktop/frontend/utils/dom.js`          | Shared DOM helpers                     |

### Test Mode Behavior

- When accessed **via Wails dev** (`localhost:34115`): full backend bridge is active, real project data is loaded.
- When opened **directly as a file** (no backend): the bridge is unavailable and fallback mock data (`safeDashboard` in `main.js`) is used. A warning toast appears.

### Test Reports

Desktop UI test plans and results should be stored in `wiki/Desktop-App.md` or a dedicated `wiki/desktop-testing.md` file.

## 17. Release Checklist

When performing a new release, ensure the version string is updated in the following locations:

1.  **CLI Version:** `internal/cmd/root.go` (`var Version`)
2.  **Desktop Backend Version:** `internal/desktop/app.go` (`var Version`)
3.  **Desktop Frontend Version:** `desktop/frontend/package.json` (`"version"`)
4.  **Wails Config Version:** `desktop/wails.json` (`"info": { "productVersion" }`)
5.  **Changelog:** `CHANGELOG.md` (Add new version section with date and changes)

Verification before release:
- Run `make test` to ensure all tests pass.
- Build and check version: `make build && ./bin/govard version`.
