## What this is

**Vocello** (`Vocello` repo, formerly `QwenVoice`; the local checkout directory and Xcode project keep the old name): local-first TTS on Apple Silicon — **Qwen3-TTS + MLX**, Swift 6, macOS/iOS 26+. No bundled weights; models download from Hugging Face. Also ships the `vocello` CLI, `scripts/`, benchmarks, and `website/`.

macOS **2.4.0** released (2026-08-01); iOS build 23 (v2.4.0) is the current TestFlight build (submitted to beta review with distribution to both groups) — internal group live, and the
**public beta link is live** (approved 2026-07-28): `https://testflight.apple.com/join/Cvp6yCv7`,
linked from the README, the repo description, and the website.
Releases are cut only on an explicit maintainer call — landed roadmap work never implies one.
Minimum support is Apple Silicon Mac with 8 GB or iPhone 15 Pro or newer. Canonical benchmark
evidence uses Mac mini M2 8 GB and iPhone 17 Pro; support and evidence hardware are not synonyms.

## Source of truth

`Sources/` → `project.yml` → machine-readable `config/` contracts → `scripts/` →
`.github/workflows/` → `CLAUDE.md` → other prose.

Model/speaker schema: [`Sources/Resources/qwenvoice_contract.json`](Sources/Resources/qwenvoice_contract.json).
The cross-platform artifact catalog
[`Sources/Resources/qwenvoice_production_model_catalog.json`](Sources/Resources/qwenvoice_production_model_catalog.json)
is complete for all six Speed/Quality artifacts and is the fail-closed macOS/CLI/iOS download
source. Static completeness does not substitute for explicit post-change live delivery evidence.
**If code or a machine-readable contract invalidates a doc, update the doc in the same change.**

## Before you edit

1. **Resume active work** — run `python3 scripts/roadmap.py status` for plan and item state, then read
   [`docs/development-progress.md`](docs/development-progress.md) for the narrative and confirm its
   checkpoint against the current checkout.
2. **Read the domain rule** — before working in a domain, read the matching file under [`.claude/rules/`](.claude/rules/) (see the routing table below).
3. **Inspect capabilities** — MCP servers and skills are user-scoped; verify a tool is currently callable before relying on it, and read every selected skill before use. Optional assists never substitute for the deterministic script gates.
4. **Minimal diff** — no drive-by refactors; preserve module boundaries and stable `accessibilityIdentifier` values.
5. **Close the loop in the same change** — a substantive arc lands together with its evidence and
   its doc updates, including narrative docs (`docs/development-progress.md`, the matching ADR or
   status report). The derived-catalogs hard rule enforces this for generated docs; this norm
   extends it to prose.
6. **Currency pass after dense workstreams** — close a multi-commit workstream with a
   `docs: currency pass` commit that re-syncs narrative prose with the tree before moving on.
7. **Ask** when the target platform or test scope is ambiguous. Commit/push policy is not
   ambiguous: deterministic verification is sufficient to preserve and share development work.

## Hard rules

| Rule | Detail / verify |
| --- | --- |
| **iOS runtime/UI = physical device + XCUITest** | Never use Simulator. XCUITest drives the paired physical iPhone; scripts provide deterministic device/telemetry proof. The generic physical-device SDK compile builds the app and standalone iOS policy-test bundle without a phone, but the selected Xcode must expose matching iOS Platform Support/runtime availability for `generic/platform=iOS`. `scripts/lib/ios_platform_preflight.py check` validates that host component before build setup and never downloads, boots, or executes a Simulator. Xcode 26 cannot execute the app-host-free tool-hosted bundle on a physical-device destination, so it remains compile-only; `gate` remains a physical-device runtime diagnostic, not a UI-result gate. |
| **`project.yml`, not pbxproj** | After edit: `./scripts/regenerate_project.sh` + `./scripts/check_project_inputs.sh`. iOS resources: `sources:` + `buildPhase: resources` (not `resources:`). |
| **Generated output follows one contract** | `config/build-output-policy.json` owns native repository output under `build/`, child-artifact retention, and heavy-lane free-space floors. Persistent Xcode caches are `build/cache/xcode/{macos,ios-device}`; packages are shared; scratch, evidence, symbols, and distribution outputs stay in their classified trees. `website/dist` is Vite-owned website output. Run `python3 scripts/build_output_policy.py status|validate`; never add an ad hoc DerivedData or `.build`, bypass a storage preflight, or delete a whole cache when a selective cleanup suffices. |
| **Release-only config** | The project has no Debug configuration or generic `DEBUG` symbol. Every production-affecting environment override is registered in `config/runtime-debug-knobs.json` and remains inert unless `QWENVOICE_DEBUG=1` enables the master runtime gate. Compile-time test isolation belongs in test targets or a narrowly named compilation condition, never hidden app behavior. |
| **Concurrency exceptions are registered** | Every owned `@unchecked Sendable` or other unsafe concurrency declaration must be justified and covered by `config/concurrency-safety.json`. Prefer actors, `Mutex`, immutable adapters, or value types; run `python3 scripts/runtime_security_contract.py` after changing either registry or a covered declaration. |
| **MLX pins in lockstep** | `mlx-swift` + `mlx-swift-lm` together; no Core ML. → [`.claude/rules/backend-mlx.md`](.claude/rules/backend-mlx.md) |
| **Engine invariants** | Prewarm slots, event streams, cancellation, request-local sampling/memory policy, and actor/classified-session/product-finalization authority → [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) and [`config/runtime-refactor-contract.json`](config/runtime-refactor-contract.json). The contract JSON's `phaseStatus` block is the sole convergence-status authority. Prose must not restate phase status — cite the contract. The one exception is the named status report and the matching ADR, which exist to interpret it and must cite it as authority rather than assert independently (human summary: the phase table in [`docs/development-progress.md`](docs/development-progress.md)). |
| **One authority per kind of state** | Three surfaces answer three different questions and must not duplicate each other. [`config/roadmap.json`](config/roadmap.json) owns **plans and items** — the only place work status lives; validated by `python3 scripts/roadmap.py validate`, which resolves every evidence reference against the repository, and rendered to [`docs/ROADMAP.md`](docs/ROADMAP.md). [`config/runtime-refactor-contract.json`](config/runtime-refactor-contract.json) owns **convergence phase status**. [`docs/development-progress.md`](docs/development-progress.md) is **narrative** that cites both and asserts neither. Adding a fourth place to record what is in flight is the failure this rule exists to prevent. |
| **Privacy** | No PII, device identity, usernames, absolute paths, prompts, transcripts, secrets, or private metadata in any tracked content. |
| **All app UI = XCUITest** | XCUITest is the sole autonomous app UI driver for the native macOS test host and the paired physical iPhone. Do not drive native app UI with Simulator destinations or any alternate UI/coordinate/vision driver, including the computer-use MCP: computer use is assistive for the development environment only (Xcode GUI, Instruments, Finder/System Settings, reading screens, doc screenshots) and never drives Vocello's UI or substitutes for XCUITest evidence. |
| **No hidden test UI** | XCUITest observes genuine visible controls. Test-only code belongs in test targets; shippable app targets must not contain preview routes, invisible state markers, seeded UI state, or onboarding bypasses. |
| **One shared XcodeBuildMCP** | When an XcodeBuildMCP server is installed and callable, use one shared route. Call `session_show_defaults`, select `macos` or `ios-device`, and set a physical-device ID only at runtime. Never enable Simulator or UI-automation workflows for Vocello, and never configure a second server. Repository scripts remain the final gate. |
| **Scripts-first** | Repository guidance, scripts, XCUITest, and machine-readable contracts remain the gates. User-scoped MCP servers and skills assist only; they are never CI or packaging prerequisites. Gates enforce wiring (no retired harness artifacts, no Simulator UI workflows, no retired UI command aliases), not a prose keyword denylist. |
| **Publishing is deterministic-only** | Commits, pushes, pull requests, ordinary merges, ordinary CI, and release packaging require deterministic verification only. Missing models, a physical device, or XCUITest evidence must never block preserving, sharing, signing, notarizing, or uploading work. UI lanes run only for explicit frontend QA. |
| **Release evidence is process- and command-bound** | Release candidates use schema-v2 `release-evidence.json` plus a hashed `release-verification.json` bundle. A clean full-tree source identity and every platform-required step must be produced by the managed release subprocess, with the contract-defined command identity, in the same invocation and within the six-hour freshness window. Self-authored, substituted-command, partial, stale, or cross-source PASS files cannot authorize publication. iOS candidates first run the deterministic macOS gate plus device-SDK compile in that ledger, then require the non-device archive/IPA identity, entitlement, provisioning, signature, and UUID-continuity verifier against [`config/apple-platform-capability-matrix.json`](config/apple-platform-capability-matrix.json). |
| **Benchmark history is PASS-only** | Successful memory-qualified benchmark runners publish one privacy-safe record under `benchmarks/runs/` and regenerate `benchmarks/HISTORY.md`. Raw telemetry, WAVs, screenshots, traces, and `.xcresult` bundles remain untracked. Publication never stages, commits, pushes, or turns model/device availability into a development gate. The telemetry-overhead observer-effect experiment is local-only because instrumenting its `off` lane would invalidate the comparison. |
| **Raw profile traces are ephemeral** | Exact-PID profiles hash, validate, summarize, and publish before discarding the multi-gigabyte raw trace. Use `--keep-trace` only for an explicit Instruments debugging session. Failed traces stay diagnostic until superseded or explicitly acknowledged with `--compact-profile-failure RUN_ID`; status reports that space separately from automatically eligible cleanup. `--routine` prunes scratch without touching the current app, canonical caches, dSYMs, models, source, or tracked history. |
| **Memory evidence must be qualified** | Thresholds live in [`config/memory-qualification-policy.json`](config/memory-qualification-policy.json). New publishable generation benchmarks require telemetry schema v8 plus benchmark-evidence manifest v2: exact run-scoped sample sidecars, start/stop and lifecycle boundaries, zero capture failures, ≥95% sampler coverage, and no critical pressure, memory warning/exit, `hardTrim`, or `fullUnload`. macOS app/engine totals are uptime-aligned; never add independent process peaks. |
| **Audio QA is autonomous** | Engine/language promotion uses deterministic PCM QC, fixed-seed evidence, locale-locked ASR consensus, and the applicable prosody/delivery gates. Human listening is optional annotation only. A QC warning may be tracked as `passedWithWarnings`, but it is not promotion-quality until a deterministic rule or code fix clears it. |
| **Documentation is governed, not just written** | Documents under `docs/` and `.claude/rules/` carry per-file frontmatter validated by `python3 scripts/doc_metadata.py validate`; not-yet-annotated documents are reported as coverage gaps (DG-4 closes them incrementally as each is touched) and are still fact-scanned. `status: historical` or `superseded` seals the body with a digest — an accidental edit to pinned research, an archived audit, or published release notes fails the commit gate and must be re-pinned deliberately or reverted. `active` documents bind to their sources and are scanned against [`config/derived-doc-facts.json`](config/derived-doc-facts.json), which is **derived from code, never hand-typed**, so prose cannot silently contradict the tree. **This file and `README.md` are scanned too, and a contradiction in either fails the build** — until 2026-08-02 the document mandating fact-checking was the one exempt from it. Facts today: preset count and intensity tiers from `EmotionPreset.swift`, speaker count from the model contract, current release from `project.yml`, and the canonical benchmark chip from the profile flagged `canonical` in `benchmarks/hardware-profiles.json`. Delivery-instruction copy has its own text-level contract: `python3 scripts/check_delivery_instructions.py` against [`config/delivery-instruction-contract.json`](config/delivery-instruction-contract.json). Every surface the gate enforces must be named in this file or a domain rule — `python3 scripts/check_surface_coverage.py` fails otherwise, because a gate no guidance mentions is invisible to anyone reading the docs. |
| **Derived catalogs stay fresh** | Fail-closed generated inventories must be rebuilt in the same change as their sources — everything registered in [`scripts/refresh_derived_artifacts.py`](scripts/refresh_derived_artifacts.py), currently the owned-runtime `CURRENT_INVENTORY` / `FACADE_API_BASELINE`, `docs/project-health.md`, `docs/INDEX.md`, `docs/INDEX.json`, `docs/ROADMAP.md`, `config/derived-doc-facts.json`, the README charts, and the production model catalog. Prefer `python3 scripts/refresh_derived_artifacts.py refresh` then `validate` before commit/push. This does **not** auto-write narrative progress prose — when `config/runtime-refactor-contract.json` (or another meaning-bearing contract) changes status, update `docs/development-progress.md` and the matching ADR/status-report in the same change. Details: [`.claude/rules/derived-artifacts.md`](.claude/rules/derived-artifacts.md). |

Every active invariant must live here, in a domain rule, in an authoritative reference document,
or in a machine-readable contract named by one of those surfaces.
`python3 scripts/check_surface_coverage.py` enforces that: an enforced gate or contract named by
none of them fails the build.

### What the deterministic gate runs

`./scripts/check_project_inputs.sh` is the T1/T2 gate. Each entry below is a hard fail; none of them
needs a model, a device, or XCUITest. Exemptions from surface coverage live in
[`config/surface-coverage-exemptions.json`](config/surface-coverage-exemptions.json) with a reason each.

**How the checks relate to each other — which class of wrong each one can find, which classes are
covered, and what none of them can see — is
[`docs/reference/repository-self-verification.md`](docs/reference/repository-self-verification.md).
Read it before adding a gate.**

| `documentation_contract.py` | Doc lifecycle groups, links, anchors, public-fact consistency |
| `doc_metadata.py` | Per-file doc status, pinned-body digests, derived-fact contradictions |
| `check_surface_coverage.py` | Every enforced surface is named in guidance |
| `roadmap.py` | Plans, items, and evidence that resolves against the repository |
| `check_delivery_instructions.py` | Delivery-copy tier parity and direction conflicts |

| `check_convergence_promotion_gate.py` | Convergence promotion preconditions |
| `check_qwen3_backend_only.sh` | MLX is the only backend |
| `check_backend_resource_contract.sh` | Native app resource contract |
| `validate_backend_risk_spine.py` | Backend risk spine ([`config/backend-risk-spine.json`](config/backend-risk-spine.json)) |
| `check_test_workflows.sh` | One UI stack, no retired harnesses, script self-tests |
| `benchmark_history.py`, `project_health.py`, `evidence_impact.py`, `supply_chain_contract.py`, `required_step_ledger.py`, `codex_session_storage.py`, `check_release_notes.py` | Registry, health, evidence-impact, supply-chain, release-step, session-storage, and release-note contracts |

### Optional assists (user-scoped; verify before relying)

These live in user configuration, not the repository, so **no gate can validate this table** — treat it
as advisory and confirm a tool is currently callable before depending on it. Every entry is optional:
`check_project_inputs.sh` and the domain rules remain the only gates, and nothing here is ever a
prerequisite for a commit, push, or release.

> **Do not delete this section as unverifiable.** Its contents cannot be machine-checked, which is
> stated above and is the point — that is not a defect to be tidied away. `check_surface_coverage.py`
> fails if these markers or the disclaimer go missing, so removing it is a deliberate act, never an
> incidental one. Rows may be added, corrected, or dropped as user tooling changes; the section, its
> disclaimer, and its optional framing must stay.

| Task | Reach for |
| --- | --- |
| MLX arrays, lazy eval, unified memory, wired-memory coordination | `mlx-swift`, `mlx-swift-lm` skills |
| Swift 6 isolation, actors, `Sendable`, data races | `axiom-concurrency` skill |
| Swift performance, ARC, allocation, generic specialization | `axiom-swift`, `axiom-performance` skills |
| Current Apple framework behavior | `axiom-apple-docs` skill, or the sosumi MCP |
| Library, SDK, or CLI documentation | context7 MCP |
| XCUITest failure triage, `.xcresult` parsing | `test-runner`, `test-debugger` agents |
| Crash `.ips` / MetricKit symbolication | `crash-analyzer` agent |
| Flaky-test and suite-quality review | `axiom-testing` skill, `testing-auditor` agent |
| Xcode build/run/debug inner loop | XcodeBuildMCP (`macos` or `ios-device` profile only) |
| App Store submission, TestFlight, signing | `axiom-shipping`, `axiom-security` skills |
| Auditing this file | `claude-md-improver` skill |
| `website/` design and visual QA | `impeccable` skill; see [`website/CLAUDE.md`](website/CLAUDE.md) |

Plugin skills are invoked as `plugin:skill` (for example `axiom:axiom-concurrency`); personal skills by
their directory name (`mlx-swift`). Read a skill before use — none of them override a repository gate
or a domain rule.

## Workflows

### Implement a change

```sh
./scripts/regenerate_project.sh      # if project.yml changed
python3 scripts/refresh_derived_artifacts.py refresh   # if owned-runtime/docs/catalog inputs changed
QVOICE_GATES=quick ./scripts/check_project_inputs.sh   # fast loop (see below)
./scripts/build.sh build             # macOS compile check
./scripts/build_foundation_targets.sh ios   # iOS app + pure policy-test bundle compile safety
```

**Gate tiers** — fast by default, strict where it matters:

| Tier | When | What runs | Cost |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| T0 iterate | while editing | build-as-typecheck, targeted checks | seconds |
| T1 checkpoint | every `git commit` (hook-enforced, automatic) | `QVOICE_GATES=quick ./scripts/check_project_inputs.sh`; fingerprint-cached no-op when the tree is unchanged since the last pass | ~0–45 s |
| T2 CI | every push/PR (automatic) | full deterministic suite on GitHub, path-aware (docs-only pushes skip the heavy jobs but always run the lightweight `docs-contracts` validator job; `ci-required` aggregates) | minutes, non-blocking locally |
| T3 release | `v*` tags only | the full evidence/signing/notarization chain | unchanged |

`QVOICE_GATES=quick` skips only the ~75 s script self-test suite, and only while nothing under
`scripts/` or `config/` has pending changes — the surfaces those tests cover. Every wiring,
privacy, link, and contract scan still runs. Ordinary CI and release lanes never set it. The T1
hook (`scripts/hooks/precommit_gate.sh`, wired in `.claude/settings.json`) runs this automatically
before every commit; `QVOICE_SKIP_COMMIT_GATE=1` is the one-shot emergency bypass. Batch heavier
suites (deterministic tests, foundation compiles) once at the end of a change set.

### Trunk & branches

Development is trunk-based: work on `main`, commit checkpoints freely (the T1 hook gates them),
and push whenever a change set is coherent — CI validates every push and the agent watches the run
(`gh run watch --exit-status` in the background) and triages any red immediately. Branches exist
only for risky or experimental work (MLX pin bumps keep the throwaway-branch rule): name them
`feat/…`, `fix/…`, or `chore/…`, land via `gh pr create` + `gh pr merge --auto --squash`, and rely
on delete-branch-on-merge; delete stray merged branches on sight. Branch protection requires the
single `CI required` context, which passes when path-skipped jobs are skipped by design.

**Verify:** exit 0 (build is the typecheck; no formatter/linter).
The iOS compile requires the selected Xcode's matching iOS component even though it needs no phone
and never selects a Simulator destination. Restore the component through Xcode Settings if the
read-only preflight reports `blocked-toolchain-component`.

### Development verification — macOS

```sh
scripts/macos_test.sh test            # Core + XPC transport + owned Qwen3 runtime tests
./scripts/build.sh build
```

**Verify:** deterministic commands exit 0. This is enough to commit, push, open a pull request,
and merge ordinary development work. Do not invoke XCUITest solely to publish a development
checkpoint.

### Development verification — iOS

```sh
./scripts/check_project_inputs.sh
./scripts/build_foundation_targets.sh ios   # app + policy-test bundle device-SDK compile; no device/UI
```

**Verify:** deterministic commands exit 0. A paired phone, installed models, and XCUITest results
are not development-publishing prerequisites.

### Explicit frontend acceptance

Run these strict lanes only when the user explicitly requests frontend/device acceptance:

```sh
# macOS: native app UI on the current Mac.
scripts/ui_test.sh macos smoke
scripts/ui_test.sh macos benchmark
scripts/ui_test.sh macos perf      # frame-health lane; canonical-hardware PASS publishes a ui-perf record
scripts/macos_test.sh gate

# iOS: paired physical iPhone only; never Simulator.
scripts/ios_device.sh preflight
scripts/ui_test.sh ios smoke
scripts/ui_test.sh ios benchmark
# Opt-in isolated background-delivery lifecycle proof; never an ordinary UI lane.
scripts/ui_test.sh ios model-download
scripts/ios_device.sh gate
```

The platform `gate` commands remain deterministic/device diagnostics. They do not consume or
validate XCUITest results.

Generation UI tests first assert the visible Settings state: Custom, Design, and Clone Speed must
show installed/ready, Generate must be enabled, and the required clone voice must be visible before
any take. `models ensure` is explicit repair/bootstrap, never a substitute for that observation.

### Language-path verification (Phases 1–3)

```sh
scripts/macos_test.sh core-test                              # Phase 1 — macOS unit tests (no models)
python3 -m unittest scripts.test_check_ios_speech_assets     # offline Speech-bootstrap evidence fixtures
python3 scripts/test_check_language_hints.py                 # offline hint-gate fixtures
python3 scripts/test_check_language_output.py                # offline output-gate fixtures
scripts/ios_device.sh speech-assets                          # explicit DE/ES/JA/ZH system-asset bootstrap
scripts/macos_test.sh lang-bench --subset quick              # Phase 2 — macOS CLI hint gate (needs models)
scripts/ios_device.sh lang-bench --subset quick --label "lang-quick"  # Phases 2–3 — on-device hint + output (needs Speed)
scripts/ios_device.sh lang-bench --subset full --label "lang-full"   # full 19-cell matrix (hint + output gates)
scripts/ios_device.sh lang-bench --diagnostic-cohort                  # fixed 15-take autonomous failure cohort; no history
```

**Verify:** core-test + offline fixtures exit 0. iOS lang-bench must print **`hint_gate=PASS`**
and **`output_gate=PASS`** (quick: 6/6 output cells; full: 18/18 — negative control is hint-only).
Setup and interpretation: [`docs/reference/language-bench.md`](docs/reference/language-bench.md).
No listening verdict is required: exact fixed-seed WAV evidence, three-pass on-device ASR consensus,
PCM QC, and the applicable prosody gates own the automated result.

### Release QA

Release packaging is gated by deterministic build, test, identity, signing, crash, and artifact
checks. The macOS smoke lane is a standing release-candidate step: run it per candidate and record
the run ID and verdict — or a deliberate skip with its reason — in the release notes entry
(`docs/releases/`). UI benchmarks and model-dependent engine benchmarks remain explicit quality
QA. The absence of any UI or model evidence never blocks signing, notarization, artifact upload, a
macOS package, or an iOS archive/TestFlight build.

```sh
QWENVOICE_DEBUG=1 ./build/vocello bench --modes clone --variants speed \
  --lengths short,medium,long --warm 3 --voice <voice> --label "release-QA"
```

**Verify:** packaging requires the applicable deterministic platform release check. When an engine
promotion benchmark is explicitly requested, that separate quality decision also requires clean
audio-QC, telemetry comparison, fixed-seed evidence, and the applicable automated language/prosody
gates. Listening remains optional independent annotation →
[`docs/reference/benchmarking-procedure.md`](docs/reference/benchmarking-procedure.md).

## Release & security (summary)

- **macOS:** protected version tag → verified draft candidate → public notarized DMG
  ([`.github/workflows/release.yml`](.github/workflows/release.yml)).
- **iOS:** optional TestFlight archive in CI; version in `project.yml`.
- **Website:** Vercel from `website/`.
- **Security:** see [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md); macOS sandbox off (MLX), iOS App Group + increased
  memory limit, immutable Action pins, dependency review, CodeQL, SBOMs, and build attestations.
