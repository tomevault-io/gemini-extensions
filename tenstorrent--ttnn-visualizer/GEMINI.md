# Agent guidance for TT-NN Visualizer

This file orients coding agents and contributors who work on this repository.

## Purpose

TT-NN Visualizer lets users inspect **memory profiler** and **performance profiler** reports produced when using the Tenstorrent **TTNN** library (with TT-Metal). The UI is built around loading, browsing, and analyzing those reports—not general-purpose ML training or arbitrary workloads.

## Where reports come from

Reports can reach the app in several ways:

- **Upload** through the application.
- **Sync from a remote machine** over SSH.
- **Local TT-Metal tree** when the app runs on the same machine as TTNN/TT-Metal: default/conventional locations include paths under the TT-Metal checkout such as `tt-metal/generated/ttnn/reports/` and `tt-metal/generated/profiler/reports/` (memory vs profiler outputs).

When changing ingestion, sync, or path logic, keep these flows and paths in mind.

## Deployment and security posture

The app ships in two first-class shapes, and changes should work in both unless a feature is explicitly local-only:

- **Local install** on the engineer's own machine — full feature set, including local filesystem access, uploads, and remote SSH sync.
- **Hosted** at **ttnn-visualizer.tenstorrent.com** — runs with `SERVER_MODE` enabled, so `@local_only` endpoints return 403 and the frontend hides the matching UI via `getServerConfig()`.

Treat the hosted deployment as **multi-user and untrusted-input**: requests can come from anyone, instances are not mutually trusted, and uploaded payloads must be validated rather than blindly parsed. Authentication is not part of the app's model, so the `@local_only` boundary *is* the security boundary — when adding endpoints, sockets, or data flows, decide consciously whether they're safe under `SERVER_MODE`, and gate genuinely local-only features on both backend and frontend.

## Python environment

- Use a **Python virtual environment** when running or developing the backend.
- Supported versions are Python 3.10–3.14.

Backend package layout lives under `backend/` (e.g. `python -m ttnn_visualizer.app` with `PYTHONPATH=backend`).

## Architecture (high level)

- **Flask** exposes APIs, file/sync plumbing, and gateway-style behavior.
- **React** (Vite-built SPA under `src/`) holds **most product and visualization logic**. Backend changes are often thin routes, proxies, or services—not a second copy of report semantics.

If you mainly work in Python, you still benefit from knowing that many behaviors live in the frontend; for UI-only issues, prefer `src/` and API contracts over growing Flask-only business rules.

## HTTP API conventions

- **Instance scoping:** Report-backed routes (operations, tensors, buffers, metadata, stack-trace, etc.) expect **`instanceId` as a query parameter**. The React app’s `axiosInstance` injects it on every request from session storage / URL; paths do not embed instance IDs.
- **`/api/remote` subtree:** Remote SSH flows are grouped under **`/api/remote/...`**. Canonical names include `POST /api/remote/profiler-reports`, `POST /api/remote/performance-reports`, `POST /api/remote/test`, `POST /api/remote/sync`, `POST /api/remote/use`.
- **GET vs POST:** Read-only stack trace file checks use **`GET /api/remote/stack-trace/test`** and **`GET /api/remote/stack-trace/read`** with `?filePath=...`. **POST** is used where the body carries SSH connection material (folder listing, sync, use, test).

## Running the app from a development checkout

Prerequisites: **Node** + **pnpm** (see `package.json` `engines`) and an activated **Python virtual environment**.

- **`FLASK_ENV=development`** (or unset) — frontend dev. Run **`pnpm dev`** (Vite, hot reload) and **`pnpm flask:start-debug`** in parallel.
- **`FLASK_ENV=production`** — Flask serves the built SPA. Run **`pnpm build`** after frontend changes, then `pnpm flask:start-debug`. Suits Python-focused developers who rarely touch the UI.

## Code quality and linting

### Backend

All **Python** code in this project should satisfy **Black**, **isort**, and **mypy** as configured here. The exact `pnpm` wrappers live in **`package.json`** (for example `flask:lint`, `flask:format`, `flask:mypy`); use those scripts so flags and paths stay consistent with CI.

### Frontend

`tsconfig*`, **ESLint**, **Stylelint**, and **Prettier** are the source of truth for TypeScript/React and stylesheet work (`.css`, `.scss`, `.sass`). Match the style already in the file you're editing and keep typing strict. Don't add lint suppressions unless explicitly requested — assess whether the warning is right first (it usually is). Format only the code you touched; don't reformat unrelated paths. All frontend changes should pass **`pnpm lint`** (`pnpm lint:fix` for auto-fixes).

### SPDX

New source files need a valid SPDX header in the project format with the **current year**. Validate with **`pnpm lint:spdx`**. Don't bump the year when editing existing files.

## Repository and issue tracking

Development happens on GitHub under:

- **Organization:** `tenstorrent`
- **Repository:** `ttnn-visualizer`

When looking up **issues, pull requests, or releases**, use **github.com/tenstorrent/ttnn-visualizer** as the canonical source.

### Pull request base branch

Open pull requests with **`dev`** as the base branch by default.

## Code style and conventions

> See [`CONVENTIONS.md`](./CONVENTIONS.md) for the expanded reference — same rules as below, with examples, file/line references, and rationale.

### Comments

- Comments must explain **why**, not what. Avoid restating what the code obviously does (`// increment counter`, `// import module`). Don't narrate the change you're making in a comment (`// Fixed the bug by adding a guard`).
- Preserve `//` placeholder lines inside multi-line array/object literals where they already exist — they intentionally prevent auto-formatters from collapsing the line.
- Stale comments are bugs. If you change behaviour, update or delete the comment.

### TypeScript

- Prefer **named enums** over inline string-literal unions when the union has semantic meaning (e.g. `enum NodeRelation { Input = 'input', Output = 'output' }` rather than `'input' | 'output'`). Use string-valued enums so the runtime values match the previous union — bare `enum NodeRelation { Input, Output }` is a numeric enum (`Input = 0`, `Output = 1`) and silently breaks string comparisons. One-off booleans/flags don't need enum promotion.
- When using third-party generic containers (`DataSet<T>`, `Map<K, V>`), spell out the type parameter rather than relying on inference that obscures intent.
- Respect `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps`. If you suppress it, add a one-line comment explaining the trade-off and why the missing dep is intentionally stable.
- Default to **`interface ComponentNameProps`** for component props (the `Props` suffix is required), declared immediately above the component. Reserve `type` for unions, generic-constrained mappings, and `Omit`/`Pick` derivations.
- Don't annotate components with **`React.FC`**, **`FC`**, or **`React.FunctionComponent`**. Type props directly on the function (`function Foo({…}: FooProps)` / `const Foo = ({…}: FooProps) =>`). Components with children declare **`children: ReactNode`** on `FooProps`.
- Prefer **`null`** over **`undefined`** for intentional “no value” in your own state, return types, and API-shaped data (`T | null`, default `null`). Keep **`undefined`** for optional properties, omitted keys, and third-party signatures you cannot change.

### CSS / SCSS

- Don't hardcode colour values in TS/TSX. Promote to a CSS custom property in `src/scss/_base.scss` (e.g. `--graph-focused-node: #f6bc42;`), then expose it through `GRAPH_COLORS` in `src/definitions/GraphColors.ts` via the `cssVar()` helper. Components import from `GRAPH_COLORS`, never from a literal.
- The same rule applies to magic layout numbers used in more than one place — promote to a SCSS variable or CSS custom property.

### Lint discipline

- Pre-existing lints in code you didn't touch are not yours to fix in unrelated PRs. Surface them if they matter; don't sprawl scope.
- Lint suppressions (`// eslint-disable-next-line ...`, `# type: ignore`, etc.) require an explanatory comment on the same or preceding line.
- When a lint warning looks wrong, assess its **validity** before reaching for a suppression. Many warnings point at a real latent issue worth fixing properly (e.g. ref-read-in-render warnings often signal a stable-singleton pattern that could be expressed more cleanly).

### Testing

- Frontend: **Vitest** + `@testing-library/react` (`pnpm test`).
- Backend: **pytest** with `caplog`, `tmp_path`, and the shared **`client`** fixture (Flask's `app.test_client()`, defined in `backend/ttnn_visualizer/tests/conftest.py`) for endpoint tests.
- For larger test suites — characterisation tests, refactor regressions — build **shared fixture helpers** (see `tests/mlirFixtures/builders.ts`) and **cross-cutting invariant checks** (see `tests/mlirFixtures/invariants.ts`) instead of repeating ad-hoc setup.

### Frontend data integrity

- Prefer **client-side JSON validation** for user-uploaded JSON before the backend parses it. Surface validation errors with a friendly UI message rather than a 5xx round-trip. Use `try { JSON.parse(...) } catch (e) { ... }` and shape-check predicates.

### Upload security

- All file-upload handlers must apply `Path(filename).name` to user-supplied filenames before composing destination paths. On our Linux/macOS servers this collapses POSIX-style traversal components (`../`, absolute prefixes). **Caveat:** `\` isn't a path separator under POSIX, so backslash-separated paths and Windows drive-letter prefixes survive `.name` unchanged — they become literal filename characters inside the target directory rather than traversal vectors, so containment still holds, but don't read the helper as a full cross-platform sanitiser. Add a regression test that submits a crafted traversal filename and asserts the file lands inside the intended directory.

### Toolchain and package management

- **pnpm** is the only supported frontend package manager (`engines.pnpm >= 11`). Don't `npm install` or `yarn add`.
- The Node version is pinned via **`.nvmrc`**. Use `nvm use` from the repo root; `corepack` handles pnpm shimming automatically on Node 16+.

### Database schema changes

- New columns on existing tables go via **Alembic migrations**, not ad-hoc `ALTER TABLE`. The app declares `alembic` in `pyproject.toml` and runs migrations on startup.
- When adding a column referenced by ORM models, declare it `nullable=True` (or with a default) so existing databases don't break before migrations apply.

### State management (Jotai)

- All shared atoms live in **`src/store/app.ts`** and end with the `Atom` suffix (e.g. `activeProfilerReportAtom`). Components and hooks consume atoms — they do not declare new ones inline. Add new atoms in the section comment block matching their feature area.
- Prefer **`useAtomValue`** for read-only consumers and **`useSetAtom`** for write-only consumers; use **`useAtom`** when a component both reads and writes the same atom. Don't subscribe via `useAtom` if you only need one half of the tuple.
- Use **`atomWithStorage`** from `jotai/utils` for user-preference flags that need to survive reloads — never reach for `localStorage` directly.

### Data fetching (React Query)

- Type every hook as **`useQuery<Data, AxiosError>`** — don't let the error parameter fall back to `unknown`. Call sites depend on `AxiosError` shape (e.g. `error?.status === HttpStatusCode.UnprocessableEntity`).
- Query keys are tuples of `['kebab-string-name', ...reactiveDeps]` (e.g. `['fetch-all-buffers', bufferType, activeProfilerReport?.path]`). Report-bound queries use `staleTime: Infinity`. Keys that need invalidation from another module are exported as `*_QUERY_KEY` constants.

### Errors and toasts

- Funnel error-string extraction through **`getResponseError(error, fallback?)`** (`src/functions/getResponseError.ts`). Don't reach into `error.response.data.error` ad-hoc — the helper handles AxiosError, Error, and string fallbacks consistently.
- Emit toasts via **`createToastNotification(message, fileName, ToastType.X)`** (`src/functions/createToastNotification.tsx`). Don't import `toast` from `react-toastify` directly in components. The `<ToastContainer>` is mounted once in `Layout.tsx`.

### File organization and modules

- **`src/definitions/`** holds *primitives*: enums, route/endpoint maps, plot/colour configs, plain interfaces. **`src/model/`** holds richer domain types — usually API response shapes, sometimes classes with methods. If it mirrors a backend response, it's a model.
- URL endpoints are centralized in the **`Endpoints` enum** (`src/definitions/Endpoints.ts`); routes in the **`ROUTES` frozen const** (`src/definitions/Routes.ts`). Never inline a URL string in a component.
- Test IDs are centralized in **`TEST_IDS`** (`src/definitions/TestIds.ts`, `Object.freeze`'d) and referenced from both component `data-testid` attributes and test queries. No hardcoded test-id strings.
- General value formatters (`toReadableShape`, `formatDuration`, `stripEnum`, etc.) live in **`src/functions/formatting.ts`**. Add new pure formatters there instead of redefining ad-hoc helpers inside feature modules.

### Naming

- Function-name prefixes carry meaning. Match them when you add new functions:

  | Prefix | Purpose |
  |---|---|
  | `use*` | React hook (must follow rules of hooks) |
  | `handle*` | Event handler bound to a UI event |
  | `get*` | Pure accessor or formatter |
  | `is*`, `has*` | Boolean predicate |
  | `fetch*` | Async axios wrapper returning `Promise<T>` |

- **Prefer named constants over magic strings or numbers.** Promote semantic literals — user-visible copy, status keys in comparisons, thresholds, durations, retry counts, storage keys — to **`SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`** at module scope: `const` (no `export`) for module-private values, exported from `src/definitions/` when shared across modules. The bar is "could a reviewer guess *why* this value, not just *what*?". Self-evident arithmetic (`length - 1`, `> 0`, array index `0`) and one-shot constructor arguments stay inline. Colour and shared layout literals follow the stricter [CSS / SCSS](#css--scss) rules (CSS custom property / SCSS variable, not a TS const).
- **Prefer an enum when constants belong to a related set.** When literals form one closed group — status values, mode kinds, error codes, toast types, validation states — declare them as an `enum` in `src/definitions/` (or the owning module) rather than a bag of independent `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` consts. Use **string-valued** enums (`enum X { A = 'a', B = 'b' }`) when the value crosses a serialisation boundary (JSON, URL params, storage keys, backend-string comparisons); numeric enums are reserved for purely internal sets. Once the enum exists, every call site uses the enum member — never the underlying literal, even when it would match at runtime. The runtime-value companion to the type-union rule above. **Members use `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`** (e.g. `PerfOverlayStatus.UNAVAILABLE`); some older enums use PascalCase but new code follows the SCREAMING_SNAKE form.
- **Name `Map`/`Record` accumulators after the relation they encode** — pattern `valueByKey` (`deviceTimeByOpId`, `aggregatesByOpId`, `operationNamesById`). Don't use bare `map`, `obj`, or `result` outside a trivially short scope.
- Backend module-private helpers prefix with a single underscore (e.g. `_file_path_from_stack_source_request`).

### Backend conventions

- Module-level logger: **`logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)`** at the top of every backend module that logs. Use `logger.info/warning/error/exception`, never `print`.
- View decorator stack order: **`@api.route → @with_instance → @timer`**. Use **`@local_only`** to gate endpoints that must refuse `SERVER_MODE` (uploads, local-only flows); it returns 403 automatically.
- Error responses go through the helpers in `backend/ttnn_visualizer/exceptions.py`: **`response_bad_request / response_not_found / response_forbidden / response_unprocessable_entity / response_internal_server_error`**. Don't hand-roll `jsonify({...}), 400`. Use **`StatusMessage`** (Pydantic) when the response needs to carry a `ConnectionTestStates` status alongside the message (uploads, sync, connection-test endpoints).
- Env-var booleans go through **`str_to_bool(os.getenv("FOO", "false"))`** — never `bool(os.getenv(...))` (which is truthy for `"false"`).
