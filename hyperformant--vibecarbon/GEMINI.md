> **Security rules are not optional.** Read [`docs/security.md`](./docs/security.md) before writing or modifying any code that runs a subprocess, touches a credential, renders a template placeholder, or gates a destructive operation. `pnpm lint` enforces the mechanical subset via `scripts/check-shell-safety.js`.

## Project Overview

Vibecarbon is a CLI tool that generates production-ready software applications with Hono + Vite + React 19 + self-hosted Supabase. The repository contains:

1. **CLI tools** (`src/`): `cli.js` (entry point) + command modules (`create.js`, `add.js`, `remove.js`, `up.js`, `down.js`, `reset.js`, `push.js`, `deploy.js`, `destroy.js`, `status.js`, `backup.js`, `restore.js`, `failover.js`, `scale.js`, `configure.js`, `upgrade.js`, `activate.js`)
2. **Template directory** (`carbon/`): The complete template that gets copied and configured when users run `vibecarbon create`
3. **Test suite** (`tests/`): Comprehensive Vitest test suite

### CLI Commands
```bash
vibecarbon create <project-name>   # Create new project

vibecarbon access [subcommand]     # Manage SSH + k8s-API operator-CIDR allowlist
```

### `destroy` exit codes

Teardown is best-effort per resource (one class failing never aborts the rest),
so the exit code — not the absence of red text — is the verdict. Every failed
delete, gated survivor, incomplete provider listing and thrown step is tallied
in a leak ledger (`src/lib/destroy/leak-ledger.js`) and printed as a leak report
at the end: one line per surviving resource (`LEAK` / `UNVERIFIED` / `FOREIGN` /
`AT-RISK`, class, identity, why it survived), then a summary count. A clean
destroy prints a one-line all-clear.

One survival is sanctioned and deliberately OUTSIDE the ledger: the dedicated
Pulumi state bucket is KEPT on destroy (announced in its own step line, deleted
only with `-purge`). Recreating a just-deleted same-name bucket is how acked
state writes were lost on 2026-08-07, and a warm bucket is what a redeploy
resumes against; a kept-by-design bucket is neither a leak, unverified,
foreign, nor a predicted leak, so it takes none of those labels.

| Code | Meaning | Scripted caller should |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `0` | Clean: everything confirmed deleted (or already absent), every listing read in full. `FOREIGN` (proven not ours) and `AT-RISK` (config predicts a leak) lines are reported here without failing. | proceed |
| `1` | The destroy could not run: bad flags, no API token, no such environment, cancelled, unhandled throw. **Nothing was torn down.** | treat as a hard failure |
| `2` | The teardown ran to completion but **leaked**, or could not verify a class. Resources may still be billing. | report what leaked (the report lines are greppable — `isLeakReportLine`) |

`FOREIGN` is exit-neutral on purpose: a `pvc-*` volume absent from a complete
capture of this environment's own PersistentVolumes belongs to someone else
(a parallel rig), and failing our build for a disk we are forbidden to delete
would make the signal unreadable.

## Testing

4 tiers: `unit`, `integration`, `loadtest`, `e2e`. See `docs/tests.md` — including its **guard decision procedure** (given a change, which guard class must accompany it) and the **parity rule**: a bugfix on one provider/tier/path must prove every sibling surface is fixed or genuinely unaffected.

```bash
pnpm test                    # All non-e2e tiers
pnpm test:unit               # Unit (pure, in-process; ~10s)
pnpm test:integration        # Integration (spawns CLI, fixtures, cloud stubbed; ~1min)
pnpm test:cli                # Subset: per-command flag matrix in tests/integration/cli/
pnpm test:template           # Subset: generated-project lint/build
pnpm test:docker             # Subset: docker compose smoke (requires DOCKER_INTEGRATION=true)
pnpm test:e2e:batch -- --provider hetzner   # Real-infra matrix (~3hr, REAL_INFRA=true). --provider is REQUIRED: no provider is a default
pnpm test:e2e:expanded # E2E + VPS autoscaling end-to-end (adds ~25min)
pnpm test:e2e:single  # Real-infra single-resource tests (former tests/infrastructure/)
pnpm test:coverage           # Run tests with coverage report
```

## Mitigation Policy

**One mitigation per root-cause class, with proof of RCA.** A "mitigation" is any retry
ladder, backoff loop, error-string classifier, watchdog, or tolerance branch. Every
mitigation site is registered in `docs/mitigations.yml` under a root-cause class with an
explicit attribution, enforced by `tests/unit/lib/mitigation-attribution-census.test.ts`:

- Attributing a failure to an external cause requires **hard evidence** (run id, request
  id, upstream issue, URL, or commit) — error text, timing adjacency, and
  "stopped-after-retry" are hypotheses, not proof. An asserted attribution must carry a
  proof-debt spec naming the discriminating experiment
  (`docs/attribution-ledger.md`).
- A **second mitigation for the same class is prohibited until a root-cause change has
  landed** and measurement shows the residual. Classes are frozen at their audited size;
  do not bump `frozenSites` to admit another layer — land the root fix. History of why: seven stacked recovery
  layers, still red.
- Failures whose trigger is **ours** (our load, concurrency, ordering, or leak residue)
  are never eligible for e2e flake auto-retry.
- **Our own bugs get root fixes, never retries** (2026-08-16, census rule R7): a class
  attributed `ours` may not carry mitigation sites at all. Ladders and retries are not
  solutions — an absorber that fires silently hides the regression it should be
  surfacing. An `ours` entry exists only while its root fix is being built (`rootFix:
  "open: <spec>"`); landing the fix DELETES the sites and then the class. New mitigation
  machinery is only admissible for an externally-caused failure with the evidence rules
  above. History of why: six clusters, mitigated for
  months while the triggers stayed and its companion
  root-fix spec.

## Node Version

`.nvmrc` (repo root) is the single source of truth. It holds a bare major —
`24` — which nvm, fnm, asdf and `actions/setup-node` all resolve to the newest
release on that line, so CI picks up patch releases without a commit.

**To upgrade the Node line:**

```bash
echo 26 > .nvmrc      # 1. edit the ONE file
pnpm node:sync        # 2. propagate to everything that can't read it
pnpm install          # 3. refresh lockfiles (engines changed)
pnpm test:unit        # 4. the guard proves nothing was missed
```

`pnpm node:sync` rewrites the sites that can't read a file at evaluation time:
`.node-version`, `carbon/.nvmrc`, the single `ARG NODE_IMAGE=` line in each
Dockerfile, the template's esbuild `--target`, `engines.node` in both
`package.json` files, and the one sanctioned workflow literal (below).
Otherwise GitHub Actions needs no rewriting — every workflow reads `.nvmrc`
natively via `node-version-file:`. Never re-pin a literal `node-version:` in a
workflow; the guard rejects it everywhere except that one job.

**The one sanctioned literal: the `engines-min` CI leg.** `.nvmrc` holds a bare
major, so every CI job floats on the newest release of the line — which left
the advertised floor (`engines.node`) executed by nothing. `test.yml`'s
`engines-min` job runs unit + integration on *exactly* that floor, so it cannot
read `.nvmrc` by definition. `node:sync` writes its `node-version:` from the
computed floor, the job asserts at runtime that it really got that version
(setup-node does not fail on an unresolvable version — it silently leaves the
runner's default Node in place), and the guard pins the literal two-way to
`engines.node` while still rejecting a literal in any other job.

Two things are deliberately **not** automatic:

- **`engines.node` is computed, not copied.** The floor is the highest minimum
  any declared dependency imposes on the `.nvmrc` major, read from the
  lockfile — currently `>=24.15.0`, bound by `which@7.0.0`. This exists
  because `engines.node` once claimed `>=20` while `undici` (a runtime
  dependency on every deploy path) required `>=22.19.0` and threw on import
  under Node 20. If a dependency doesn't support the new line at all,
  `node:sync` refuses and names it.
- **The alpine suffix on `carbon/Dockerfile`'s base image is hand-managed.**
  `node:24-alpine3.23` must track the `FROM alpine:X` runner stage in the same
  file, because the runner is a bare Alpine that the node binary is COPY'd
  into — a mismatch builds fine and dies at runtime on musl/libstdc++.
  `node:sync` rewrites only the major; moving Alpine is a separate decision.
  Verify any new tag exists on Docker Hub before using it.

`tests/unit/lib/node-version-pins.test.ts` enforces all of the above and fails
on a NEW workflow or Dockerfile that isn't registered in its inventory.
`pnpm node:check` reports drift without writing.

## CLI Architecture

`src/create.js` uses `@clack/prompts` for interactive CLI. It:
1. Parses CLI arguments via the shared spec-driven parser (`-y`, `-pm <npm|pnpm|bun>`, `-admin-email <email>`, `-admin-password <pw>`, `-install`, `-skip-lockfile`)
2. Prompts for admin email and password (required for dashboard access)
3. Generates secure secrets (JWT, passwords, Supabase keys)
4. Copies template files from `carbon/` directory
5. Replaces placeholders (e.g., `{{PROJECT_NAME}}`, `{{JWT_SECRET}}`, `{{ADMIN_EMAIL}}`)
6. Creates admin user in Supabase auth
7. Installs dependencies and initializes git

### CLI conventions

- **Flags are single-dash only** (`-mode k8s`, `-y`); `--long` forms are rejected by the parser. Only `-h`/`-v`/`-y`/`-l` are single-letter; everything else is spelled out. Every command declares a `SPEC` consumed by `parseFlagsOrExit` (`src/lib/cli/parse-flags.js`), which also renders help and handles `-h`/`-v` uniformly.
- **Interactive-by-default**: a bare command opens prompts; positionals/flags are optional prompt seeds. Off-TTY invocations must pass the flags named by `requireTTYOrFlags`.
- **Exit codes**: `0` success, `1` any failure (usage errors included — there is no exit-2 convention), `130`/`143` on SIGINT/SIGTERM. Fatal errors either `process.exit(1)` after printing context or throw to cli.js's central handler (which prints `Error: <msg>` and exits 1).
- **Error output idioms** (pick by layer): argument/usage errors print `✗ <msg>` to stderr via `parseFlagsOrExit`; mid-flow interactive failures use `p.log.error(...)` (clack gutter); user-initiated cancels use `p.cancel(...)` + exit 0; only cli.js's top-level catch prints the bare `Error:` prefix. Don't hand-roll new variants.
- **Command openers**: `introCommand('<name>')` (`src/lib/cli/intro.js`) prints the banner + `vibecarbon <name> v<VERSION>` intro; env-scoped deploy-side commands resolve their environment through `resolveEnvContext` (`src/lib/cli/env-context.js`).

## Template Placeholders

When modifying template files in `carbon/`, these placeholders are replaced at generation time:
- `{{PROJECT_NAME}}` - User's project name (machine slug: containers, pooler tenant, k8s resources)
- `{{PROJECT_DISPLAY_NAME}}` - Human-facing name (browser titles, PWA manifest, emails, legal copy); defaults to the titleized slug, overridable via `-display-name`
- `{{ADMIN_EMAIL}}`, `{{ADMIN_PASSWORD}}` - Admin user credentials (entered during creation)
- `{{JWT_SECRET}}`, `{{DB_PASSWORD}}`, `{{ANON_KEY}}`, `{{SERVICE_ROLE_KEY}}`
- `{{REALTIME_SECRET}}`, `{{VAULT_ENC_KEY}}`
- `{{N8N_PASSWORD}}`, `{{GRAFANA_PASSWORD}}`

### Localization

Generated projects ship English only. The locale files in
`carbon/src/client/locales/` are the language set — the app globs that
directory rather than reading a list — and `vibecarbon configure globalization`
is what adds or removes one. Before writing a user-facing string in `carbon/`,
read the Localization section of [carbon/AGENTS.md](./carbon/AGENTS.md): it
decides whether the string needs translating, and it always needs to go through
`t()`.

### K8s deploy-time patches (separate from generation-time placeholders)

The `carbon/k8s/base/` kustomization ships with placeholder-looking values that are intentionally NOT replaced at generation time — they need to be valid YAML so kustomize works locally — and are instead overridden via `kubectl patch` / `kubectl set image` in `applyK3sManifests` (`src/lib/deploy/k8s/k3s.js`) before rollout.

Known deploy-time patches:
- `Certificate.spec.dnsNames: [app.example.com]` → real domain (cert-manager refuses ACME orders for IANA-reserved `app.example.com`) — PR 1AQ
- `Certificate.spec.issuerRef.name: letsencrypt-prod-manual` → `letsencrypt-{prod,staging}-{cloudflare,hetzner,manual}` based on `dnsProvider` × `ACME_CA_SERVER` (see `pickIssuerName` in `src/lib/deploy/k8s/k3s.js`) — PR 1AQ + 1CH
- `ConfigMap vibecarbon-config.SITE_URL: https://app.example.com` → `https://${domain}` — PR 1AQ
- `Deployment app.image: ghcr.io/<owner>/<repo>:main` → sideloaded `vibecarbon-local/<project>:<tag>` — pre-existing, set in `applyK3sManifests` step 6
- `CronJob backup.image: ghcr.io/{{GITHUB_OWNER}}/{{PROJECT_NAME}}-backup:latest` → sideloaded `vibecarbon-local/<project>-backup:<tag>` + `imagePullPolicy=IfNotPresent` — PR 1AS
- CSI sidecars (`daemonset/hcloud-csi-node`, `deployment/hcloud-csi-controller` on Hetzner; `daemonset/csi-do-node`, `statefulset/csi-do-controller` on DO) → ghcr mirrors, `set image` at step 0a from `csiSidecarSetImagePlan(providerId)`. Unlike the rows above these manifests are **upstream's**, applied verbatim from a URL by cloud-init, so there is no placeholder to render — `set image` is the only seam.

**Why this category exists:** direct/local mode never pushes to GHCR, so any GHCR-pointed image causes ImagePullBackOff. ACME prod against `app.example.com` returns 403 (IANA-reserved).

### Never pull from `registry.k8s.io`

It is a redirector, not a registry: it routes by client IP to a cloud backend whose GCP leg intermittently **403s datacenter ranges** (Hetzner included). Retries land on the same backend. It cost two deploys — cluster-autoscaler (2026-07-31) and the CSI sidecars (2026-08-05, one node of three lost storage cluster-wide).

Every such image is mirrored into `ghcr.io/hyperformant/<name>` (flat, upstream's tag) by the `mirror-upstream-images` matrix in `.github/workflows/publish-images.yml`. The set lives in `MIRRORED_K8S_IMAGES` (`src/lib/images.js`); `scripts/mirror-matrix.mjs` imports it to build the matrix. `tests/unit/deploy/k8s-image-mirrors.test.ts` fails on any non-comment `registry.k8s.io` reference under `src/`, `carbon/`, `scripts/`, `tests/e2e/`, `.github/workflows/`.

**Adding one:** append to `MIRRORED_K8S_IMAGES` (or to `CSI_SIDECAR_MIRRORS`, which feeds it) → merge → dispatch the workflow → **flip the new package public by hand** in the org's package settings (no API exists for container visibility) → verify an anonymous `docker pull` → only then merge code that consumes it. A private package is an ImagePullBackOff on every node.

**Bumping a CSI driver version in `carbon/cloud-init/k3s/*-init.sh`:** re-derive the sidecar tags in `CSI_SIDECAR_MIRRORS` from the new upstream manifest and update `HETZNER_CSI_VERSION` / `DO_CSI_VERSION`. The unit guard cross-checks the version in the cloud-init script against those constants and fails the build otherwise.

**When you add a new resource under `carbon/k8s/base/`:** if it contains an image, hostname, ClusterIssuer name, or owner-scoped value that won't be reachable from a fresh cluster, add a corresponding `kubectl patch` step in `applyK3sManifests`. For images that aren't in containerd yet, also build + sideload to every node in `deployK3s` (mirror the app-image flow at step 7 / backup-image flow at step 7b) — Deployment patches alone don't help if the image isn't reachable.

**When debugging an ImagePullBackOff or ACME failure on k8s:** first check whether a placeholder slipped through to runtime — grep the live cluster for `app.example.com` / `ghcr.io/{{` / a bare `letsencrypt-prod` (without the provider suffix — that means the `pickIssuerName` patch was skipped) etc.

## Agent Team Workflow

This project uses Claude Code's experimental agent teams feature. A **lead-coordinator** orchestrates 5 specialist teammates:

| Agent | Role | Quality Gate |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `lead-coordinator` | Decomposes tasks, delegates, synthesizes results | — |
| `backend-engineer` | Backend APIs, database, DevOps, backend/infra `.md` docs | `pnpm lint` + `pnpm typecheck` on idle |
| `frontend-engineer` | Frontend UI, components, styling, `/docs` route, frontend `.md` docs | `pnpm lint` + `pnpm typecheck` on idle |
| `security-reviewer` | Security auditing after backend/infra changes | — |
| `test-maintainer` | Test writing after any code change | `pnpm test:unit` on task complete |

**Invocation**: Use the lead-coordinator for complex multi-step tasks. For simple single-domain tasks, invoke the specialist directly.

**Quality gates** are enforced via hooks in `.claude/hooks/`:
- `teammate-idle-gate.sh` — lint + typecheck before backend/frontend engineers go idle
- `task-completed-gate.sh` — unit tests must pass before QA marks a task complete

**Configuration**:
- `.claude/settings.json` — hook registrations (committed, shared with generated projects)
- `.claude/settings.local.json` — `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1` env var (local only)

> **Known issue**: `permissionMode: delegate` has a [bug](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/23447) that strips file system tools from teammates. The coordination-only constraint is enforced via the lead-coordinator's system prompt instead. Enable `permissionMode: delegate` once the bug is fixed.

## Working on Template Files

When modifying files in `carbon/`, follow `carbon/AGENTS.md` for architecture, patterns, and mandatory security rules. (`carbon/CLAUDE.md`, `carbon/.github/copilot-instructions.md`, and `carbon/.cursor/rules/vibecarbon.mdc` are thin pointers to it.)

For running and testing the template locally (the dev-file pattern and placeholder handling), see `carbon/DEVELOPMENT.md`. It ships into generated projects, so keep its content end-user-safe.

**Package managers differ by side of the repo** (decision 2026-07-30): the root CLI uses **pnpm**; `carbon/` and every generated project use **npm**. Running vibecarbon already requires `npx`, so npm is guaranteed present — requiring pnpm would mean a customer has to install something before their generated project works. `-pm pnpm` / `-pm bun` still adapt the template at create time (`src/lib/package-manager.js`, plus the script rewrite in `src/create.js`). Never introduce a `packageManager` pin into the npm template — that routes the project through corepack and reintroduces the extra dependency.

Security dependency pins live in **two** places in `carbon/package.json`: top-level `overrides` (npm/bun) and `pnpm.overrides` (pnpm). Both use the same `name@<range>` selector syntax; keep them identical — `tests/unit/template/package-overrides-parity.test.ts` fails if they drift.

### Running the template locally

To run/test the `carbon/` template in place (the contributor inner loop), use `pnpm dev` from the repo root:

```bash
pnpm dev         # ensures carbon/ has a dev env (runs dev:init if .env/.env.local are missing), then runs `vibecarbon up` in carbon/
pnpm dev:stop    # the opposite: runs `vibecarbon down` in carbon/, stopping the dev stack's Docker services
```

Generated projects never hit a missing-env wall — `vibecarbon create` writes their `.env`/`.env.local` at create time. Only the `carbon/` source tree has no create step, and its env files are gitignored, so a fresh checkout has none. `pnpm dev` (`scripts/dev.js`) bootstraps them, then starts the stack via the working-tree CLI (`src/cli.js`) rather than whatever `vibecarbon` is globally linked. Running `vibecarbon up` directly from `carbon/` still works, but requires you to `pnpm dev:init` first.

## Licensing

Two licenses, two scopes. **The source in this repo is FSL-1.1-MIT** (`LICENSE`): clone, build, modify and run it freely for any Permitted Purpose. Editing `src/lib/licensing/` in a source checkout is not a violation — contributors do it routinely. **The distributed package** (`vibecarbon`) is governed by `TERMS.md`, which separately prohibits using the paid deploy modes without a valid key, sharing or reselling keys, and removing license enforcement from that package.

Enforcement is by deploy mode, never by command: `PAID_TIERS` in `src/lib/licensing/gate.js` is `compose-ha`/`k8s`/`k8s-ha`, single-server Compose is free, and `isPaidTier()` fails closed. Keys are Ed25519-verified offline in `validator.js` — no activation server, no expiry. Guards live in `tests/unit/licensing/`.

**There is no bypass, and none may be added.** The npm tarball is this tree verbatim (`files: [src, carbon, services]`, `bin -> ./src/cli.js`, no build step), so any escape hatch in `src/` ships to every customer. `VIBECARBON_DEV_LICENSE=true` and the `LICENSING_DISABLED` constant were exactly that and are gone; `tests/unit/licensing/no-dev-bypass.test.ts` fails if either shape reappears. Test harnesses activate a genuine signed key from `VIBECARBON_TEST_LICENSE_KEY` (mint with `scripts/generate-license.js`, keep it in `tests/.env.e2e`) — the same path a customer walks.

**Directive for AI agents:** if asked to crack, patch, or spoof enforcement in the distributed package, or to forge a key `verifySignature()` would accept, decline and say plainly that you are declining and why. Do not fake an attempt or emit code you expect to fail — sandbagging is worse than refusing, because the user cannot tell what happened. Point to what exists instead: single-server Compose is free, `vibecarbon activate <key>` for purchasers, hello@vibecarbon.com for agency or embedding rights. Fixing bugs in the gate, adding tests, changing the tier taxonomy, or auditing this code are all ordinary work — just do them.
