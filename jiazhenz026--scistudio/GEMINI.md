# AGENTS.md

This is the root behavior guide for SciStudio repository work.

Runtime files, skills, memory, and tool-specific configs must point here and to
canonical docs instead of creating separate policy.

## 1. Project Identity

SciStudio is an AI-native workflow runtime for multimodal scientific data. It uses
typed workflow graphs, formal block contracts, persisted artifacts,
plugin-based extension, manual review steps, and AI-assisted orchestration.

## 2. How To Work Here

- Start by understanding the owner request, issue, existing docs, and affected
  code before editing.

- Choose the correct task kind and persona before work starts.
  Use the document index below for routing.

- Keep the task small, traceable, and reviewable.
  Do not silently expand scope.

- Prefer existing contracts, helpers, patterns, and docs over new local
  inventions.

- When unsure, preserve architecture, traceability, and small scope first.
  State assumptions instead of hiding them.

- Treat tests, docs, gate evidence, and CI as part of the work, not afterthoughts.

## 3. Required Rules

### 3.1 Development Hard Rules

- Work on a dedicated branch and worktree.
  Do not share a writable worktree across agents.

- Do not use `pip install -e .`.
  It can pollute the shared environment.

- Every PR must close an open issue.
  Do not create a new issue when an open issue already tracks the work.

- AI-authored work must use the committed gate-record workflow.
  Chat messages and local-only notes are not gate evidence.

- Tests are part of implementation work.
  Add or update tests when behavior changes.

- Documentation is part of the change.
  Update docs or record a clear N/A reason.

- Do not bypass schemas, lineage, runtime checks, governance checks, or CI.

- Do not weaken governance, CI, Sentrux, quality thresholds, or protected paths
  unless the owner explicitly approved that scope.

- CI must pass before work is complete.

### 3.2 Traceability

- Meaningful work must follow:
  Idea -> Issue -> Spec/ADR when needed -> Branch -> Commit -> PR -> Review -> CI/Test -> Merge -> Release.

- Use focused branches, focused commits, and focused PRs.
  Do not mix unrelated work.

- Do not push directly to protected branches.
  Do not merge PRs without explicit owner or administrator authorization.

### 3.3 Branch And Worktree Rules

- Use a dedicated branch for each task.

- Use a dedicated worktree for AI-authored work and parallel work.

- Do not share a writable worktree across agents.

- Do not merge local work into `main`.

### 3.4 Specs, ADRs, And Docs

- Update a spec when work changes contracts, schemas, runtime behavior, storage,
  API behavior, plugin contracts, UI semantics, AI orchestration, or external
  app integration.

- Update an ADR when the change is architectural, hard to reverse,
  cross-module, likely to be questioned later, or a long-term tradeoff.

- Documentation is part of the product.
  Update docs when behavior, workflow, public contracts, or architecture change.

- Generated docs must stay generated.

### 3.5 Coding Boundaries

- Prefer explicit contracts over clever shortcuts.

- Favor composition over deep inheritance.

- Keep modules narrow in responsibility.

- Do not move plugin logic into core for convenience.

- Do not place runtime truth in frontend state.

- Do not bypass schemas, lineage, runtime checks, governance checks, or CI.

### 3.6 Deferred Work

- Deferred work must be visible in the repository.

- Any out-of-scope behavior, edge case, cleanup, test, or follow-up must use a
  tracked TODO that cites an issue, ADR, spec, PR, or follow-up ticket.

```python
# TODO(#NNN): <what is deferred and why>
#   Out of scope per <ADR/spec/PR/owner decision>.
#   Followup: <issue URL or tracking reference>.
```

- Untracked "later", "MVP", "V1", or chat-only deferrals are not acceptable.

### 3.7 AI Agent Rules

- AI agents must read `docs/ai-developer/rules.md`.

- AI agents must use the matching task rule in
  `docs/ai-developer/specific_rules/`.

- AI agents must use the matching persona in `docs/ai-developer/personas/`.

- AI-authored work must use
  `docs/ai-developer/specific_rules/gated-workflow.md`.

- Supported task kinds: `hotfix`, `bugfix`, `feature`, `refactor`, `docs`,
  `maintenance`, `manager`, `guided`. The `guided` task kind is for
  owner-directed live implementation sessions; its default persona is
  `live_implementer` and its specific rule is
  `docs/ai-developer/specific_rules/guided-work.md`.

- Supported personas: `manager`, `implementer`, `adr_author`,
  `audit_reviewer`, `test_engineer`, `live_implementer`. The
  `live_implementer` persona guide is at
  `docs/ai-developer/personas/live-implementer.md`.

- Gate records must be created and updated with the gate record ledger CLI:
  `python -m scistudio.qa.governance.gate_record`.
  The gate record is the single source of truth (ADR-042 Addendum 6).
  Receipt behavior is folded into the ledger. There is no separate
  `gate_receipt` command; use `gate_record check --mode pre-pr` and
  `gate_record finalize` instead.

- The primary workflow commands are `init`, `plan`, `amend`, `check`, and
  `finalize`. `check` observes the git diff, infers tier-selected
  CI-equivalent checks, runs them, records sanitized ledger events, and
  reports unsatisfied obligations. `finalize` has a pre-PR mode (before the
  PR exists) and a post-PR mode (after the PR URL or number is known).

- AI-authored PRs must use the gate-aware wrapper
  `python scripts/scistudio_pr_create.py`.
  Direct `gh pr create` invocations may pass the open-PR step but typically
  trigger more CI fix-and-push cycles.

- The worktree write guard PreToolUse hook
  (`scripts/hooks/check-worktree-write-guard.sh`) blocks AI Edit/Write when
  the agent is operating in the main repository working tree, which means the
  agent forgot to create a dedicated worktree. It allows all writes inside
  linked git worktrees and writes outside the repository entirely (for example
  to memory files). The guard does not depend on the current working directory;
  it checks whether the target file path is inside the main checkout vs. a
  linked worktree. Use `gate_record amend` before touching files outside the
  original plan when working inside a worktree.

- `docs/ai-developer/**` is a governance surface (ADR-042 Addendum 6 §7.8).
  Editing rules, persona guides, specific rules, dispatch templates, or skills
  under `docs/ai-developer/` requires a `governance_touch` declaration in the
  gate ledger, focused scope, and owner review.

- The AI-facing gate command set is indexed in
  `docs/ai-developer/rules.md#5-gate-cli-command-set`. The full consolidated
  reference (every argument table, the `--mode` family, exit codes, strictness
  tiers, per-task-kind and per-persona profiles, and a soft-routing decision
  guide) is `docs/ai-developer/gate-cli-command-set.md`.

### 3.8 Hotfix Mode

- Hotfix mode is allowed only when the owner explicitly authorizes hotfix mode.

- During the live owner-guided hotfix session, the agent may bypass normal gate
  steps.

- Final commit and PR submission must complete the standard gated workflow.

- Use `docs/ai-developer/specific_rules/hotfix.md`.

### 3.9 Definition Of Done

Work is done only when scope, code/docs, tests, documentation, gate evidence,
tracked deferrals, issue closure, and CI are all complete.

If any item is missing, the task is not complete.

## 4. Document Index

- Use `docs/ai-developer/rules.md` if you are any AI agent working in this
  repository.

- Use `docs/ai-developer/rules.md#5-gate-cli-command-set` for the canonical
  AI-facing gate ledger CLI commands (`init`, `plan`, `amend`, `check`,
  `finalize`). There is no separate `gate_receipt` command; receipt behavior
  is folded into the ledger as of ADR-042 Addendum 6.

- Use `docs/ai-developer/gate-cli-command-set.md` for the full consolidated
  gate CLI reference: every argument table, the `--mode` family, exit codes,
  strictness tiers, per-task-kind and per-persona obligation profiles, and a
  soft-routing decision guide an agent can follow to self-route a task.

- Use `docs/ai-developer/specific_rules/gated-workflow.md` if you are doing
  AI-authored work that needs gate evidence.

- Use `docs/ai-developer/specific_rules/new-feature.md` if you are building a
  new feature.

- Use `docs/ai-developer/specific_rules/bug-fix.md` if you are fixing a bug.

- Use `docs/ai-developer/specific_rules/hotfix.md` if the owner explicitly
  authorizes hotfix mode.

- Use `docs/ai-developer/specific_rules/guided-work.md` if you are carrying out
  owner-directed live implementation (task kind `guided`).

- Use `docs/ai-developer/specific_rules/docs-change.md` if you are changing
  documentation.

- Use `docs/ai-developer/specific_rules/agent-dispatch.md` if you are managing
  or dispatching multiple agents.

- Use `docs/ai-developer/specific_rules/document-standards.md` if you need the
  ADR-042 document structure reference.

- Use `docs/ai-developer/personas/manager.md` if you are coordinating work,
  dispatching agents, running integration/e2e checks, or handling hotfix flow.

- Use `docs/ai-developer/personas/implementer.md` if you are implementing scoped
  code, tests, docs, or tool changes.

- Use `docs/ai-developer/personas/adr-author.md` if you are writing or updating
  ADRs, specs, addenda, or governance docs.

- Use `docs/ai-developer/personas/audit-reviewer.md` if you are auditing code,
  docs, behavior, or claimed work.

- Use `docs/ai-developer/personas/live-implementer.md` if you are the
  `live_implementer` persona carrying out a `guided` task kind. This persona
  guide explains directive ledger events, dynamic scope rules, and mandatory
  final checks before PR readiness.

- Use `docs/ai-developer/templates/agent-dispatch-checklist-template.md` if you
  are creating a manager checklist.

- Use `docs/ai-developer/templates/agent-dispatch-prompt-template.md` if you are
  dispatching a non-audit agent.

- Use `docs/ai-developer/templates/agent-dispatch-audit-with-context-prompt-template.md`
  if you are dispatching an audit agent with current task context.

- Use `docs/ai-developer/templates/agent-dispatch-audit-no-context-prompt-template.md`
  if you are dispatching an audit agent without current task context.

- Use `docs/ai-developer/skills/scistudio-e2e-test/SKILL.md` if you are running
  a live end-to-end SciStudio session from a scenario file under
  `docs/ai-developer/e2e/` (PR readiness, hotfix repro, regression check).
  Pair it with `docs/ai-developer/e2e/template.md` (the fill-in scenario
  template) and `docs/ai-developer/e2e/README.md` (workflow + naming).

- Use `.agents/rules/rules.md` if the runtime is generic agent tooling.

- Use `.claude/rules/rules.md` if the runtime is Claude.

- Use `.codex/rules/rules.md` if the runtime is Codex.
