# CLAUDE.md — working on zigui

Agent-facing guide: how to build/test, the non-obvious gotchas, the architecture
map, the recipe for adding a component, and how the post-v0 feature set
(navigation, tabs, modals, grids, animation, materials, accessibility, HiDPI) is
implemented. User-facing docs live in [README.md](README.md); design rationale in
[PRD.md](PRD.md).

## TL;DR

`zigui` is a SwiftUI-like UI library in **pure Zig 0.16**. The core (geometry,
color, state, layout, theme, text, canvas, software rasterizer, GPU scene
translation, view layer, components) has **no C dependencies** and is fully
unit-tested headlessly. SDL3 links only into example executables (`src/app.zig`
+ `src/gpu/gpu.zig`). On screen, rendering is **GPU-accelerated via SDL_GPU**
(Metal on macOS, Vulkan on Linux/Windows) with an automatic fallback to the
**CPU software rasterizer** presented through an SDL streaming texture — both
backends consume the same `Canvas` command list and produce output identical to
within 1 LSB, so tests/CI stay on the software path. See
[GPU backend](#gpu-backend--sdl_gpu-metalvulkan-with-software-fallback).

The post-v0 feature set — grids, tabs, navigation, modals/overlays, animation,
materials/blur, accessibility, and HiDPI — is **implemented**; see
[Post-v0 features](#post-v0-features-implemented) for the shipped APIs and the
seams each one uses.

## Build / test / run — and the gotchas

```sh
zig build test --summary all                # 169 tests, headless. THIS is the inner loop.
zig build showcase edit                      # build the two examples (does NOT run them)
zig build run-showcase                       # opens a window — blocks on the event loop
docker build -t zigui-test .                 # run the full suite on Linux

# Headless UI iteration (renders one frame to a BMP, no window):
./zig-out/bin/showcase --screenshot /tmp/sc.bmp [section] [--dark] [--accent N]
./zig-out/bin/edit --screenshot /tmp/edit.bmp [file] [--demo-find|--demo-dialog]
# sips -s format png /tmp/sc.bmp --out /tmp/sc.png   # to view on macOS
# --bench N re-rasterizes the frame N times and prints ms/frame (build with
# -Doptimize=ReleaseFast) — use it when touching src/render/raster.zig.
# --gpu (showcase only) renders the frame through the real SDL_GPU pipeline
# offscreen (works headlessly on macOS/Metal) — THE verification loop when
# touching src/gpu/ or src/render/gpu_scene.zig; diff the BMP against the
# software output. Combine with --bench N for a full-sync GPU ms/frame.
```

There are exactly **two examples**: `examples/showcase` (the kitchen-sink gallery
— every public component across sidebar sections, plus live light/dark and accent
switchers, built on the macOS 26 theme) and `examples/edit` (the multi-line text
editor). The old `hello`/`settings`/`llm-chat`/`screenshot` examples were folded
into `showcase` and removed.

- **Use `zig build test`, NOT `zig test src/zigui.zig`.** The bundled Inter font
  is an anonymous import `inter_font` wired only in `build.zig`
  (`mod.addAnonymousImport("inter_font", ...)`); `text/ttf.zig` does
  `@embedFile("inter_font")`. The raw `zig test` invocation has no such import
  and fails.
- **Never run `zig build run-*` in a headless/agent context** — it opens an SDL
  window and blocks in `SDL_WaitEvent`. Use `zig build showcase edit` to verify
  the backend compiles/links, or the `--screenshot` flag to render one frame.
- Tests are **inline** (`test "..." {}` blocks). A module's tests only run if the
  root (`src/zigui.zig`) imports it — add a `pub const x = @import(...)` there.
- **Zig 0.16 gotchas hit during the build** (so you don't rediscover them):
  - `std.ArrayList(T)` is **unmanaged**: `var l: std.ArrayList(T) = .empty;`
    then `l.append(allocator, x)`, `l.deinit(allocator)`.
  - `std.testing.refAllDeclsRecursive` is gone; use `refAllDecls`.
  - `std.fs` is reorganized (no `cwd()`/`accessAbsolute` free fns; moved to
    `std.Io.Dir`). The build script avoids fs probing entirely.
  - **The new `std.Io` model removed a lot from `std`**: the socket primitives
    (`socket`/`connect`/`fcntl`/`send`/`recv`/`close`) are gone from `std.posix`
    *and* not `pub` in `std.c`; `std.net` moved to `std.Io.net`; `std.time` lost
    `milliTimestamp`/`sleep`; `std.process.argsAlloc` is gone (args arrive via a
    `std.process.Init.Minimal` first param to `main`, iterated with
    `std.process.Args.iterate`); `std.heap.GeneralPurposeAllocator` is gone (use
    `page_allocator`/`DebugAllocator`). `examples/llm-chat` sidesteps the socket
    gap by `@cImport`-ing the POSIX headers (libc is linked) — see its
    `chat_client.zig`.
  - **Inferred error sets + recursion = "dependency loop"**. Mutually/​self-
    recursive fns that allocate must declare an explicit error set, e.g.
    `Allocator.Error!void` (see `engine.arrange`, `ttf.collectEdges`).
  - **Don't name fields/methods after primitives** (`u16`, `i16`, …) — compile
    error. (See the `Be` reader in `ttf.zig` using `rdU16` etc.)

## Architecture map (data flow)

```

  └─ buildNode → layout.Node     (lowering; modifiers become padding/frame nodes)
       └─ engine.arrange → LayoutResult (frames)   src/layout/engine.zig (+ stack.zig)
            └─ paint co-walks View + LayoutResult, emitting DrawCommands

```

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `src/view/view.zig` | **The engine + facade.** `View`, `Kind` union, `Modifiers`, `Context`, `buildNode`/`buildContentNode`/`measure`/`render`/`paint`/`paintContent`, `HitAction`/`dispatchTap`, focus, overlays, the text context-menu, and the primitive components (text/shape/button/toggle/slider/stepper/progress/picker/textfield/editor/icon/scroll). Re-exports the `components/` modules so historical `view.X` names stay stable. |
| `src/components/*.zig` | Cohesive, separable components split out of the hub: `navigation`, `tabs`, `menu`, `grid`, `list`, `collections` (Sidebar/Table/RadioGroup), and `text_buffer` (`TextFieldState` + pure UTF-8 line/column geometry). Each imports `view.zig` for the shared primitives/helpers; `view.zig` re-exports their public names. |
| `src/layout/engine.zig` | `Node` union, `Proposal`, `SizingHints`, `measure`, `arrange`→`LayoutResult`. Pure, tested. |
| `src/layout/stack.zig` | `distribute()` — the stack space-allocation math. Pure. |
| `src/render/canvas.zig` | `DrawCommand` union + `Canvas` builder. The renderer-agnostic seam. |
| `src/render/raster.zig` | `Framebuffer` + software rasterizer (SDF AA). Where new draw primitives get pixels. |
| `src/render/gpu_scene.zig` | Pure GPU scene translation: `DrawCommand`s → packed `Instance` array + shelf-packed glyph/image `Atlas` + `Step` list (draw runs split at blurs). Headless-tested; no C. |
| `src/gpu/gpu.zig` | The SDL_GPU shell (app layer, links C like `app.zig`): device/pipelines/textures, replays a translated `Scene`, offscreen `renderToRgba` for verification. Shaders in `src/gpu/shaders/` (GLSL→committed SPIR-V via `compile.sh`, plus runtime-compiled MSL twins). |
| `src/text/*` | `ttf` (parser+rasterizer), `atlas` (`GlyphCache`), `shape` (measure/wrap), `font` (`drawText`). |
| `src/theme/theme.zig` | `Theme`, `Palette`, `Metrics`, `Typography`, and the **`Painter`** vtable + `Surface`/`ControlState`/`Role`. The color-scheme/painter vocabulary. |
| `src/theme/{macos,win2000,windows10,kde,mui}.zig` | The five built-in theme families: each exports `light`/`dark` `Theme` values and a `Painter` impl drawing that family's chrome (liquid glass / bevels / flat / Breeze / Material). |
| `src/theme/registry.zig` | `Family` enum + `forScheme(family, scheme)` — picks a `Theme` for the OS appearance (light-only families ignore dark). |
| `src/state/*` | `State(T)`, `Binding(T)`, `Observer`. |
| `src/app.zig` | SDL3 window/event loop. Links C (the only other C file is `src/gpu/gpu.zig`, which it owns). Where overlays, animation ticking, HiDPI scale, key routing, GPU-vs-software backend selection, and `systemTheme()`/`colorScheme()` (OS dark/light) get wired. |
| `src/components.zig`, `src/zigui.zig` | Public re-exports. |

### Key invariants
- **Per-frame arena.** The view tree, lowered nodes, draw commands, and hit
  regions are all allocated in an arena that is `reset(.retain_capacity)` each
  frame and **persists until the next rebuild** — so hit regions stay valid
  during event dispatch. Observable `State`/`Binding` live *outside* the arena
  (app-owned).
- **Constructors use a thread-local build arena** set by `view.beginBuild(arena)`
  / `endBuild()`. Build views only between those calls (the app and `TestEnv` do
  this for you).
- **`dispatchTap` walks hit regions back-to-front** (last appended = topmost).
  This is why overlays/modals work: append their regions last.
- **Paint inherits environment** via a copied `child_ctx` (foreground, font_size,
  opacity, disabled). Add new inherited properties there.

## Recipe: add a component

1. **Data + `Kind` variant** in `view.zig` (e.g. `pub const FooData = struct {…};`
   then add `foo: FooData` to `Kind`).
2. **Constructor** free fn: `pub fn Foo(...) View { return .{ .kind = .{ .foo = … } }; }`
   (use `buildAlloc()` if it needs to own a slice/child).
3. **Sizing** — add an arm to `buildContentNode` returning an `engine.Node`
   (usually a `.leaf` with `SizingHints`, or a `.stack`/`.padding`/`.frame`).
4. **Painting** — add an arm to `paintContent` that emits `Canvas` commands for
   `clr.frame`; multiply colors by `ctx.opacity`.
5. **Interaction (optional)** — add a `HitAction` variant, handle it in
   `performAction`, and `ctx.hit_regions.append(ctx.arena, …)` in your paint fn.
6. **Re-export** in `components.zig` and `zigui.zig`.
7. **Test** (inline, using the `TestEnv`/`Harness` pattern): build → `render` to a
   `Framebuffer` → assert pixels and/or state mutations via `dispatchTap`.

Study `Toggle`/`Slider`/`Picker` end-to-end as the template — they cover sizing,
painting, and `Binding`-mutating interaction.

## Testing conventions
- Inline `test` blocks; pixel assertions via the software rasterizer
  (`Framebuffer.at(x,y)` → `Color`, plus `approxEql`, `luminance`).
- Reuse the `TestEnv` (in `view.zig`) / `Harness` (in `integration_test.zig`)
  helpers: they set up a `Font`, `GlyphCache`, arena, hit list, and `Context`.
- Anything time-based **must take `dt` as a parameter** (no `std.time.*` /
  `Date.now` in tested code) so it stays deterministic.

## Post-v0 features (implemented)

All of these ship, are headless-tested, and are re-exported from `zigui.zig` /
`components.zig`. The cross-feature integration test in `integration_test.zig`
exercises nav + tabs + sheet + material + a11y together; `examples/showcase`
demos them in a real window. Notes below record *how* each is wired and the
deliberate deviations from the original plan, so you can extend safely.

### GPU backend — SDL_GPU (Metal/Vulkan) with software fallback
On-screen rendering now goes through **SDL3's GPU API** (Metal on macOS, Vulkan
on Linux/Windows; D3D12 needs DXIL blobs, a follow-up — Windows uses its Vulkan
driver meanwhile), replacing the framebuffer-upload present path while keeping
it as the automatic fallback (`Config.gpu = false` or `ZIGUI_SOFTWARE=1` forces
it; device/swapchain failure falls back silently). No new dependencies: the C
surface is `src/gpu/gpu.zig`, owned by `app.zig`, sharing its `@cImport`.

The split keeps the repo's testing philosophy intact:
- **`src/render/gpu_scene.zig` (core, pure, tested)** — `translate(arena,
  commands, atlas, w, h)` turns the command list into (a) a flat `Instance`
  array (one 144-byte extern struct per draw command: padded quad, shape rect,
  colors, gradient/line endpoints, atlas UVs, resolved clip, kind/params), (b)
  a shelf-packed RGBA8 `Atlas` keyed by stable coverage/pixel pointers (the
  `GlyphCache` owns glyph bitmaps app-lifetime, so pointer = content), with
  pending-upload staging and grow/reset recovery (`error.AtlasFull` → caller
  grows ×2 up to 8192 and re-translates), and (c) a `Step` list — draw runs
  split wherever a `blur_rect` must sample what's already rendered. The clip
  stack is folded per instance into the axis-aligned intersection of all clip
  rects + the innermost *rounded* clip (matches the rasterizer except nested
  rounded clips, which components never emit).
- **`src/gpu/gpu.zig` (app layer, C)** — device + 3 pipelines + replay. One
  *unified* instanced pipeline draws every primitive kind as a 4-vertex
  triangle-strip quad; the fragment shader evaluates the **same SDFs as
  `raster.zig`** (`clamp(0.5 - sd, 0, 1)` AA, centered strokes, round-capped
  segments, clamped gradient lerp) and samples the atlas for glyphs (coverage
  in alpha, tinted) and images — so one draw call per `Step.draw`. Blend state
  is straight-alpha `over` (dst stays opaque from the clear, matching CPU
  compositing exactly). `Step.blur` = H box-blur pass (scene→scratch) + V-blur
  + `tint.over` composite masked by the rounded rect and clip (mirrors
  `boxAverage` incl. region-clamped windows). Frames render into an offscreen
  scene texture, then `SDL_BlitGPUTexture` to the swapchain.
- **Shaders** in `src/gpu/shaders/`: GLSL sources compiled to **committed
  SPIR-V blobs** by `compile.sh` (needs `glslc`; only when shaders change) and
  hand-written **MSL twins** compiled by Metal at runtime — keep both in sync.
  SDL_GPU binding conventions: SPIR-V vertex uniforms `set=1`, fragment
  textures `set=2`, fragment uniforms `set=3`; MSL uses `[[stage_in]]` +
  `[[buffer(0)]]`/`[[texture(0)]]`. NDC is +Y-up on **all** backends (SDL
  converts for Vulkan), so both sources share the same `-ndc.y` flip.

Output parity: verified pixel-identical to the rasterizer (max 1 LSB/channel)
across every showcase section, dark mode, all theme families, sheets/alerts,
and materials via `showcase --screenshot --gpu` diffs. Known benign exception:
GPU rasterizers snap edges to a ~1/256-px subpixel grid, so a glyph whose
origin lies within ~1/512 px of a pixel-center boundary may round to the
neighboring column (<0.01% of pixels, still crisp). Perf at Retina 1960×1320:
~1.3 ms/frame vs ~8.9 ms software (the GPU number is mostly CPU-side
build/layout/translate). Steady-state allocations: instance/transfer buffers
and atlas persist; per-frame data lives in the frame arena.

Gotchas for future work here:
- `Atlas.pendingUploads()` slices arena memory — consume + `clearPending()`
  within the frame; never hold across frames.
- `translate` retries must happen *before* `upload` (a grow resets packing).
- Don't sample a texture that's the current render-pass target: blur ends the
  scene pass before H reads the scene texture (the pass-break exists for this).
- A frame whose *first* command is a blur still needs the scene cleared first
  (`Encoder.ensureCleared`).
- The `--gpu` screenshot path works headlessly on macOS (Metal needs no
  window/server) — Linux CI without Vulkan falls back, so don't gate CI on it.

### Icons — `Icon` / `IconButton` (bundled icon font, reuses the glyph path)
A second embedded font (`assets/fonts/icons.ttf`, a ~50-glyph subset of **Lucide**,
ISC) is wired as the `icon_font` anonymous import alongside Inter, exposed as
`Font.icons()` and `ttf.icon_ttf`. The catalog is `src/icons.zig`: `Icon` (re-
exported as `zigui.IconName`) is an `enum(u21)` whose **value is each glyph's PUA
codepoint**, so rendering is just `glyphIndex(codepoint)` through the ordinary text
path — icons are tintable and HiDPI-crisp for free, with **no new `DrawCommand`**.
`font.drawIcon` rasterizes the glyph centered in a square box (same device-res
coverage trick as `drawTextScaled`). `Context` gained a defaulted-null
`icon_cache: ?*GlyphCache` (the app wires it next to `cache`; `TestEnv` sets it;
when null, icons paint nothing — the safe fast path). View constructors:
`Icon(.heart, 18, color_or_null)` (a `size`×`size` leaf; `null` color inherits
`.foreground`) and `IconButton(.trash, 18, callback)` (a padded square tap target
reusing `.callback`). Call sites rely on enum-literal inference, so the `IconName`
type name is rarely spelled out. Subset/regenerate via `pyftsubset` + the codepoints
in `icons.zig`; attribution in `assets/fonts/NOTICE.md`. (Tests: `view: Icon …`,
`view: IconButton …`; `drawIcon: …` in `font.zig`.)

### Grids — `LazyVGrid` / `LazyHGrid` (composition, no new primitive)
`LazyVGrid(columns, spacing, items, mapFn)` maps `items`→cells, chunks them into
rows, and returns a `VStack` of `HStack`s; `LazyHGrid` is the transpose. Cells get
`.frameMaxWidth()`/`.frameMaxHeight()` for even tracks, and a short final row is
padded with invisible `Empty()` cells so **columns stay aligned**. No `Kind`-level
grid was needed. (`view.zig`; tests `LazyVGrid …`/`LazyHGrid …`.)

### Themes & painters — `Palette` + `Painter` seam (macOS / Win2000 / Win10 / KDE)
A `Theme` is **palette + metrics + typography + `Painter`**. The palette
(`theme.Palette`, the renamed `Colors`) holds the semantic color roles resolved
for one `ColorScheme`; it gained translucent "liquid glass" roles
(`hover`/`control_border`/`glass`/`control_track`) and **defaulted** chiseled-bevel
roles (`control_face`/`control_highlight`/`control_light`/`control_shadow`/
`control_dark_shadow`/`on_control`) that only Win2000 sets.

The **look** is owned by a per-theme **`Painter`** — a small vtable
(`button`/`field`/`segmentedTrack`/`segmentedSelection`/`switchTrack`) that draws
only *chrome* into a `theme.Surface` (canvas + palette + metrics + scheme +
opacity, with `fill`/`stroke`/`vGradient`/`lineSeg` helpers). **Painters depend
only on the renderer + tokens, never on the view layer** — so the seam has no
dependency cycle: the view layer keeps text/layout/hit-regions and calls
`ctx.theme.painter.*` (via `ctx.surface(canvas)`) for decoration; `painter.button`
even *returns* the label color so a theme controls both at once. To add a glassy
vs. bevelled vs. flat control, implement the painter method per family — don't
hard-code a look in `view.zig`.

The five families live in `src/theme/{macos,win2000,windows10,kde,mui}.zig`:
macOS = **real Liquid Glass, pixel-matched to macOS 26** (see the parity
workflow below) — every raised surface starts with a `Surface.backdropBlur`
(a `blur_rect`, so controls genuinely frost what's beneath them; over a flat
background the blur is a no-op and the flat translucent fill + rim + soft
fake drop shadow carry the look), built from two shared treatments in
`macos.zig` (`clearGlass` neutral — near-white in light, a *lightening* white
wash in dark; `tintedGlass` flat accent/destructive with a 1px top specular);
Win2000 = 2-ring raised/sunken bevels + silver `control_face`, **light-only**;
Windows 10 = flat fills + 1px borders; KDE/Breeze = subtle gradients + thin
borders + 3px corners; Material = flat primary fills + state overlays.

`Role` (button semantics) is `normal | prominent | destructive | plain`,
matching macOS 26: a plain `Button` is *neutral* glass with a `label`-colored
title, `.plain` renders with `secondary_label` (native borderless), disabled
glass is an outline ghost, and only `ButtonRoled(…, .prominent, …)` (the
default action) carries the accent tint. The other painters map `.prominent`
to their own emphasis (Win2000 draws the classic black default-button ring;
Win10/KDE use an accent fill; Material treats it as `.normal`).

macOS-26 specifics baked into the macOS theme (all pixel-sampled from native):
- **Two blues**: `accent` #017AFE (prominent buttons) vs `selection` #3478F6
  (AppKit controlAccentColor — switches, segmented chips, slider/progress
  fills, selected table rows, radio dots). Don't mix them up.
- **Grouped surfaces**: light = white window + #F7F7F7 rows; dark = #1B1B1B +
  #222222 (rows *lighter* than the window in dark, darker in light).
- New `Palette` roles: `scrim` (modal dim wash) and `quaternary_fill` (the
  *neutral grey* sidebar selection — macOS settings sidebars are not accent).
- `Painter.panel` takes a `PanelKind`: `.modal` (sheets/alerts — **opaque**
  elevated panels, white / #161616) vs `.popover` (frosted material). Sheets
  are *centered* window modals on macOS, not bottom-anchored.
- `Painter.glassSurface` (optional, defaulted null) backs the `.glassEffect()`
  view modifier — freestanding glass for toolbar pills / inset sidebar panels
  (capsule by default, or the view's `.cornerRadius`). Non-glass themes fall
  back to a `control_track` fill + `control_border` ring.
- **Buttons are NOT capsules**: in-content buttons round at ~5.5pt
  (`metrics.control_corner_radius`); only *toolbar pills* are capsules
  (`ButtonIcon` routes through `Painter.glassSurface` for that). Steppers are
  a single 22×24 chevron column (up/down), not +/- boxes; the switch is 36×16
  with a 13pt knob; segmented chips are full-track-height rounded rects
  (radius ~5.5), not inset capsules. Sidebars get `Palette.sidebar_background`
  (#FAFAFA / #1A1B1B; null in other themes = `secondary_background`) with
  32pt rows.

Composed-component additions: `ButtonIcon`/`ButtonIconRoled` (leading glyph +
label pill buttons), `SidebarStyled(items, sel, .neutral|.prominent)`
(prominent = vivid accent selection + optional two-line `SidebarItem.detail`
subtitle rows, the chat-list style), and `NavigationSplitViewInset` (the
floating rounded glass sidebar panel of macOS 26 chat/notes apps).

### Native-parity workflow — `tools/parity/`
`RefGallery.swift` is a **real SwiftUI app** (built with `xcrun swiftc`)
mirroring the showcase Controls page with native macOS 26 controls
(`.glass`/`.glassProminent` buttons, grouped `Form`, switches, segmented
pickers, sheets/alerts/popovers). `capture.sh <out.png> [--dark|--sheet|…]`
launches it and screenshots its window via `screencapture -l` (needs Screen
Recording permission for the terminal; in-process captures render glass blank).
The macOS theme's colors/metrics were extracted by pixel-sampling those
captures with PIL — when touching the macOS look, re-capture and compare
side-by-side against `showcase --screenshot` output rather than eyeballing.
`theme/registry.zig` exposes `Family` + `forScheme(family, scheme)` (light-only
families ignore a dark request). `app.systemTheme()`/`app.colorScheme()` read the
OS preference (SDL3) so an app/theme-provider follows dark/light live; the
`showcase` footer has a theme-family **`RadioGroup`** and seeds dark mode from the
OS on the first frame. Headless: `showcase --screenshot <out.bmp> --theme N
[--dark]`.

### Build-time theme tokens — `setThemeTokens` / `BuildTokens` (for composed controls)
Composed constructors have **no `Context`** (the long-standing reason
`NavigationSplitView` takes a `sidebar_fill: Color`), but selection-driven ones
need the accent/hover tints at *build* time. So `view.zig` keeps a thread-local
`BuildTokens` (accent, on_accent, hover, row_stripe) that the app publishes once
per frame via `setThemeTokens(theme)` — wired in `app.zig` right before
`beginBuild`. Defaults match the macOS **light** theme, so headless tests and
un-wired callers render correctly with no setup. `selectAction(binding, value)`
is the matching reusable `Callback` (a build-arena `{binding,value}` + thunk, like
`NavPushCtx`) that lets selection be pure composition over `onTap` — no new
`HitAction`. Sidebar/Table/RadioGroup all use it.

### Sidebar / Table / RadioGroup — new macOS components (all pure composition)
- **`Sidebar(items: []const SidebarItem, selection: Binding(i64))`** — a source-
  list of rows (`SidebarItem{label, icon: ?IconName}`) with a rounded accent
  selection highlight, leading icon, and `hoverFill`. Each row is an `HStack`
  `.onTap(selectAction(...))`. **Gotcha:** the row's children must be allocated in
  `buildAlloc()` — `makeStackFromSlice` keeps the slice, so a stack-local array
  dangles after the constructor returns.
- **`Table(columns: []const TableColumn, rows: []const []const []const u8,
  selection: ?Binding(i64))`** — a header `HStack` over a `ScrollView` of row
  `HStack`s, with zebra striping (`build_tokens.row_stripe`) and an accent
  selected row. `TableColumn{title, width: ?f32}` (null width = flexible). Cells
  are left-aligned via `tableCell` (`HStack(.{content, Spacer()})`). Wrap in a
  fixed frame for the scrollable look.
- **`RadioGroup(selection: Binding(i64), options: []const []const u8)`** — a
  vertical list of rows; the dot is `radioIndicator` (layered `Circle`s: accent
  disc + white center when selected, hollow ring otherwise).

`examples/showcase` demos every component (sidebar shell + per-category pages)
and has a headless `--screenshot <out.bmp> [section]` path (libc BMP writer, wires
the icon cache + `setThemeTokens`) for visual iteration without a window.

### TabView — `Tab` + `TabView` (composition, reuses `.select`)
`TabView(selection: Binding(i64), tabs: []const Tab)` → a **centered glass
segmented bar on top** (macOS style), then `Divider()`, then the selected tab's
content filling the rest: `VStack(.{ bar, Divider(), content.frameMaxWidth()
.frameMaxHeight() }).spacing(0)`, where `bar = HStack(.{ Spacer(), Picker(...),
Spacer() })`. The tab **bar is a `Picker`** over the tab labels — that reuses
`Picker`'s `.select` `HitAction` and its selected-segment styling for free, so no
new interaction was added. The body switches on the binding; rebuilt each frame.

### Navigation — `NavigationSplitView` + `NavState`/`NavigationLink`/`NavBackButton`
- **Split view:** `NavigationSplitView(sidebar, detail, sidebar_fill: Color)` =
  `HStack(.{ sidebar.frameWidth(220).frameMaxHeight().background(sidebar_fill),
  VDivider(), detail.frameMaxWidth().frameMaxHeight() })`. The fill is a parameter
  because constructors have no theme. **Note:** it uses the new `VDivider` (a rigid
  narrow-width, full-height hairline), *not* `Divider` — a `Divider` is
  flex-width in an `HStack` and would eat half the detail pane.
- **Stack:** `NavState` (app-owned, `TextFieldState` pattern) holds an
  `ArrayList(i64)` route stack with `push/pop/top/depth`. `NavigationLink(label,
  route, nav)` is a `Button` reusing `.callback` — its closure ctx is a
  build-arena `NavPushCtx{nav, route}` (no new `HitAction`). `NavBackButton(label,
  nav)` pops. The body switches on `nav.top()`; render a back button when
  `nav.depth() > 0`.

### Overlays — sheets/alerts/popovers/menus (the one shared-infra phase)
The single-pass paint can't draw on top of everything, so render is split:
- **`renderInto`** = `buildNode→arrange→paint` — *collects* overlay requests and
  a11y nodes into `ctx`'s sinks but does **not** draw overlays.
- **`render`** = `renderInto(root)` **then drains** `ctx.overlays` once. The drain
  loop is index-based, so overlay content that itself presents an overlay (nesting)
  is appended and drained too — each exactly once, no recursion, no double scrim.
- `ScrollView` content and overlay content call **`renderInto`, never `render`** —
  this is the invariant that keeps the drain single-pass. Don't call `render`
  recursively.

`Context` gained `overlays: ?*ArrayList(OverlayReq)` (+ `a11y`, `scale`) as
**defaulted** fields; `Context.init` is unchanged and `initFull` wires the sinks
(so every pre-existing caller compiled untouched — do the same for future sinks).
`.sheet/.alert/.popover(presented, content)` modifiers store an `OverlayMod`
(content boxed in the build arena); when `presented.get()`, `paint` appends an
`OverlayReq{content, style, anchor=outer, dismiss=presented}` instead of drawing
inline. The drain draws a `Color.black.withAlpha(0.2)` scrim, a full-screen
tap-to-dismiss region (action `.toggle` on the dismiss binding — appended *before*
the content's own regions so content taps win), a panel bg, then the content
positioned by style (sheet=bottom, alert=centered, popover=`anchoredRect` near the
anchor). Back-to-front `dispatchTap` gives overlays priority automatically — a
modal scrim correctly blocks taps to the content beneath. `Menu`/`ContextMenu` =
a button/trigger toggling an app-owned `State(bool)` that drives a `.popover` of
item buttons. (There is no `.menu` overlay style; menus use `.popover`.)

### Accessibility — parallel a11y tree (`Context.a11y`; tree only)
`A11yNode{rect, role, label, value}` with `A11yRole{static_text, button, switch_,
slider, text_field, image, header}` (trailing `_` dodges the `switch` keyword).
`emitA11y` in `paintContent` appends one node per meaningful component when the
sink is non-null (Text→static_text, Button→button+label, Toggle→switch_+"on"/"off",
Slider→slider+value, TextField→text, Label→title, Image→image). `.accessibilityLabel`
overrides the label; `.accessibilityHidden(true)` clears `child_ctx.a11y` for the
subtree (drops it and its descendants). The **native platform bridge**
(NSAccessibility / AT-SPI / UIA) that consumes this tree is still a separable
follow-up in `app.zig`/`src/platform/`.

### Materials / blur — `blur_rect` + box blur
`DrawCommand.blur_rect{rect, radius, sigma, tint}` (`canvas.zig`) is implemented in
`raster.zig` as a separable box blur that reads from a **scratch snapshot** of the
affected region (never in place — avoids feedback aliasing), composites `tint`, and
respects the clip stack. `Material{ultra_thin, thin, regular, thick}` → `{tint,
sigma}` via `Material.spec()`; `Fill.material` + `.backgroundMaterial(m)` emit the
blur. Because the rasterizer runs commands in order, a material background frosts
whatever was drawn beneath it (earlier siblings / parent bg), not its own children.
`blur_rect` is backend-neutral: the GPU backend implements it as an H box-blur
pass into a scratch texture + a V-blur-and-tint composite pass (see the GPU
section below).

### Animation — `src/animation.zig` (dt-injected)
`Easing{linear, ease_in, ease_out, ease_in_out}` + `apply(t)`, `Tween`, and
`Animator{animateTo(state_ptr: *State(f32), target, duration, easing), tick(dt),
active()}`. `tick(dt)` advances `elapsed`, writes the eased value via `State.set`
(which marks subscribers dirty), snaps to the end and drops finished tweens.
**`dt` is a parameter — no wall clock** (determinism). The app loop owns one
`Animator`, exposes it via `app.animator()` for callbacks to start animations, and
when `active()` switches from `SDL_WaitEvent` to `SDL_WaitEventTimeout(&ev, 16)` +
`tick(dt from SDL_GetTicks)` + redraw each frame.

### HiDPI / content scaling — `renderScaled`
`renderScaled(ctx, v, point_rect, scale, canvas)` lays out + paints in **logical
points** (so layout math, theme metrics, and **hit regions stay in points**), then
uniformly scales the produced command list (rects/points/radii/widths/blur sigma ×
scale; glyph & image coverage untouched). The crispness trick: text is drawn with
`font.drawTextScaled`, which rasterizes glyph **coverage at `px*scale`** (device
resolution) but emits the quad in point space; the later ×scale lands the quad on
device pixels mapping 1:1 to the coverage — crisp, not an upscaled blur.
`dispatchTap` therefore operates in **points**, so the app converts/uses logical
mouse coordinates (SDL already reports points) — no conversion needed. `app.zig`
sizes the framebuffer/texture in device pixels (`SDL_GetWindowSizeInPixels`) and
fills the backdrop in pixels (renderScaled only scales the view commands it
appends).

### Streaming-chat additions — wrapped text, app-owned scroll, Enter-submit
Added to support `examples/llm-chat` (a streaming LLM client); all headless-tested.

- **`WrappedText(s)` — width-dependent multi-line text.** A wrapped block's height
  depends on the proposed width, which static `SizingHints` can't express, so the
  pure engine gained a new leaf: `Node.measured{ ctx, measureFn }` whose
  `measure(prop)` is answered by `measureFn` directly (and arranges leaf-like to its
  rect). `WrappedText` lowers to a `.measured` capturing `{face, arena, string, px}`;
  `measureFn` wraps at `prop.width` (reusing `shape.wrapText`) and returns
  `lines·lineHeight`; paint re-wraps at `rect.width` and draws each line via
  `drawTextC` (so HiDPI still works). Use it (not `Text`) for paragraphs/bubbles.
- **`ScrollState` + `ScrollViewState` — app-owned, wheel-driven, auto-followable.**
  `ScrollState{offset, content_h, viewport_h}` (the `TextFieldState` ownership
  pattern) with `maxOffset`/`scrollBy`/`scrollToBottom`/`atBottom`.
  `ScrollViewState(&state, content)` is `ScrollView` but reads `state.offset`;
  `paintScrollState` writes back the measured heights, clamps the offset, and (when
  `Context.scroll_regions` is set) registers a `ScrollRegion`. `dispatchScroll(regions,
  point, dy)` routes a wheel delta to the top-most region under the point (back-to-
  front, like `dispatchTap`). To pin a streaming transcript: set `offset` huge when
  it `atBottom()` — paint clamps it to the new bottom each frame.
- **`.onSubmit(cb)` + `submitFocused()` — Enter-to-send.** `Modifiers.on_submit` is
  stashed onto the focused field's `TextFieldState` during paint, so the event loop
  can fire it on Enter without the view tree (same indirection as focus).
- **`app.zig` wiring** (build-only verified): mouse wheel → `dispatchScroll`; Enter →
  `submitFocused` (ESC still `clearFocus`); a `setBusyCheck(fn)` hook — while it
  returns true (or the animator is active) the loop wakes on a 16 ms timeout and
  rebuilds, so `body` can poll an in-flight socket each frame. New `Context`
  sink `scroll_regions` is defaulted-null (the 137→146 existing tests stayed green).
- **`examples/llm-chat`** is single-threaded: `chat_client.zig` sets the socket
  non-blocking and `body` calls `client.poll()` each frame — no threads, all `State`
  mutation on the UI thread. It speaks OpenAI `/v1/chat/completions` (streaming SSE,
  de-chunking inline; one-shot for `--smoke`). Networking is `@cImport`-ed POSIX (see
  the `std.Io` gotcha above), kept in the example, not the library.
- **`TextField` honors `.cornerRadius(r)`** (else the theme's control radius) so a
  field can be pill-shaped (`.frameHeight(38).cornerRadius(19)`) — the only library
  change for the SwiftUI-style polish; everything else (sidebar rounded-selection
  rows, bordered "New Chat", circular ↑ send button, accent bubbles, centered
  `.alert` settings dialog) is composed from existing primitives in the example.
  Note left-aligning text in a full-width row needs `HStack(.{ v, Spacer() })` — a
  bare `.frameMaxWidth()` centers (frame default alignment). Inter has the arrows/
  punctuation used (↑ ■ × …); verify any new glyph before relying on it.
- **Headless UI iteration**: `llm-chat --screenshot <out.bmp> [--settings]` renders
  one frame of the real `body` to a BMP without a window (libc `fopen`/`fwrite`,
  since `std.fs` needs `std.Io` in 0.16) — `sips -s format png` to view. Build
  examples with **`-Doptimize=ReleaseFast`**: the CPU software rasterizer is ~10×
  slower in the default Debug build, which reads as UI lag.
- **System tray** (`app.Tray`/`app.TrayMenu` in `app.zig`) wraps **SDL3's native
  tray API** (`SDL_tray.h`) → NSStatusItem / Shell_NotifyIcon / StatusNotifierItem,
  so it's cross-platform with no per-OS code. The icon is an `SDL_Surface` built
  from RGBA — `llm-chat` draws its status dot via `Canvas`→`raster`→`toRgba8Alloc`
  (same pipeline as the window). The **menu is OS-drawn and retained** (build once,
  mutate imperatively — not the per-frame view tree): entries are labels/checkboxes/
  submenus/separators with a `zigui.Callback` dispatched through a C-ABI thunk
  (`SDL_TrayCallback`). `app.zig` also gained `Config.hide_on_close` + `showWindow`/
  `hideWindow`/`quit` globals (mirrors `g_animator`) so the close button hides to the
  tray and the loop skips rendering while `SDL_WINDOW_HIDDEN`. Caveat: SDL may invoke
  tray callbacks off the main thread on some platforms (main-thread on macOS) — keep
  them to flipping app-owned state / show-hide-quit.

### Multi-line editing — `TextEditor` + `TextFieldState` selection/motion
Powers `examples/edit` (a TextEdit/gedit-like editor); all headless-tested.

- **`TextFieldState` grew up.** The same struct that backs `TextField` now also
  backs the multi-line editor: it gained a `sel_anchor` (selection), a
  `multiline` flag, `pref_col` (preferred column for vertical motion), a
  `last_caret` (so the editor follows the caret only when it *moved*), and a
  `revision` counter (so an app sees "modified since saved" without diffing).
  `insert`/`backspace` delete the selection first; movement methods take an
  `extend: bool` (Shift) and `home/end/moveUp/moveDown` use the pure
  `lineStartIndex`/`lineEndIndex`/`columnOf`/`indexForColumn`/`nthLineRange`
  helpers (UTF-8-aware, line = run between `'\n'`s, column = codepoints).
- **`TextEditor(state, scroll, line_numbers)`** is a new `Kind`/component that
  *reuses* `TextFieldState`, so it shares the focus + keyboard plumbing with
  `TextField` (no second focus system). It lowers to a flexible `.leaf` (fills
  its space). `paintTextEditor` sets `state.multiline`, draws a rounded bg + focus
  border, a line-number gutter, selection highlight, the visible lines (clipped,
  scrolled by the app-owned `ScrollState`), and the caret; it **auto-scrolls to
  the caret only when `caret != last_caret`** (so the wheel scrolls freely
  otherwise) and registers a `ScrollRegion` for the wheel.
- **Click-to-position** is a new `HitAction.text_click` (payload `TextClick`)
  that carries the font + text-area origin/scroll so `performAction` (which only
  has the tap point, no `Context`) can resolve the byte index via `caretIndexAt`/
  `caretInLine`. **Mouse drag-selection** reuses it: mouse-down anchors the
  selection + arms `g_drag` (a thread-local `*TextFieldState`); the app's
  `MOUSE_MOTION` (button held) calls `dispatchDrag`, which finds that field's
  re-emitted region in the current frame (so mid-drag scroll stays correct) and
  extends the caret; `MOUSE_BUTTON_UP` → `endDrag`.
- **Tabs** render to tab stops (multiples of `editor_tab_size` spaces), not the
  font's `.notdef` box: `editorPrefixWidth` (caret/selection x), `drawEditorLine`
  (run-by-run between tabs), and `caretInLine` (hit test) share one advance walk.
- **`app.zig` key routing** (build-only verified) now sends Up/Down/Home/End/
  Delete + Shift-extend to the focused field, makes Enter insert `'\n'` for a
  `multiline` field (else `submitFocused`), and Tab indent. A new
  `setKeyHandler(fn(key, mods) bool)` hook (mirrors `setBusyCheck`) gets first
  refusal on every key-down so an app can grab ⌘-shortcuts/clipboard; `examples/
  edit` uses it for ⌘S/O/N/F/A and ⌘C/X/V (SDL clipboard) and ⌘±/0 zoom.
  `setFocus` is now exported so an app can focus the editor at launch.

## Coding conventions
- Readability over cleverness (it's an open-source teaching codebase). Match the
  surrounding comment density and naming. Avoid heavy comptime.
- Colors always go through `multiplyAlpha(ctx.opacity)` when painting.
- New shapes/effects: add a `DrawCommand` and handle it in **both** backends —
  the software rasterizer (`render/raster.zig`) and the GPU path
  (`render/gpu_scene.zig` + the shaders in `src/gpu/shaders/`, GLSL **and** MSL,
  then re-run `compile.sh`) — keeping command semantics backend-neutral. Verify
  with `showcase --screenshot --gpu` diffed against the software BMP.
- Run `zig build test` after every change; keep it green.
