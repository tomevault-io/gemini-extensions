# AlterLab FC Skills — Claude Code Project Instructions

> **Project**: AlterLab FC Skills — 72 Claude AI skills for Faculty of Communication students
> **Owner**: AlterLab Creative Technologies Laboratory
> **Repo**: AlterLab-IEU/AlterLab_Fc

---

## Project Overview

This project generates **72 professional Claude AI skills** organized into 6 department packs for communication faculty students worldwide. Each skill transforms Claude into a domain-specific expert assistant tailored to real coursework, creative production, and professional workflows in communication disciplines.

### Department Packs

| Pack | Folder | Students | Skill Count |
|------|--------|----------|-------------|
| **PRA** — Public Relations & Advertising | `skills/pra/` | PR, advertising, marketing communication | 12 |
| **CDM** — Cinema & Digital Media | `skills/cdm/` | Film, animation, digital media production | 12 |
| **NMC** — New Media & Communication | `skills/nmc/` | New media, journalism, multimedia | 12 |
| **GenAI** — Generative AI Production | `skills/genai/` | Higgsfield, ElevenLabs, Suno workflows | 12 |
| **VCD** — Visual Communication Design | `skills/vcd/` | Graphic design, typography, branding, UI | 12 |
| **RMA** — Research Methods & Academic Writing | `skills/rma/` | Research methodology, academic writing, data analysis | 12 |

### Key Principles
- **UNIVERSAL**: No university-specific references. These skills work for ANY communication student globally.
- **ALTERLAB VOICE**: Follow the AlterLab skill format exactly (see template below).
- **PRODUCTION-READY**: Every skill must be immediately usable — not theoretical, not placeholder.
- **COURSE-MAPPED**: Skills align to standard communication faculty curricula worldwide.
- **AGENTIC**: Every skill autonomously researches, creates file-based deliverables, self-reviews, and iterates.

Each skill lives in its own folder (`alterlab-{dept}-{name}/SKILL.md`) following the AlterLab NEXUS convention.

### Naming Convention
- **Folder**: `alterlab-{dept}-{skill-name}` (lowercase, hyphenated)
- **Frontmatter name**: `"alterlab-{dept}-{skill-name}"`
- **Collection label**: `Part of the AlterLab FC Skills collection ({Department} department).`

## AlterLab Skill Format — MANDATORY TEMPLATE

Every SKILL.md MUST follow this exact structure. Do NOT deviate.

```markdown

1. **Emojis in H3 headers ONLY**: 🧠 🎯 🚨 📋 🛠️ 📊 🎭 📈 💡 (+ 🔑 for PRA only) — use exactly these, in this order. The "Agentic Protocol" section uses NO emoji (plain H3). The 🔑 Key Frameworks Quick Reference section is OPTIONAL and used only for PRA department skills.
2. **Bold agent name** in the opening line after the H1
3. **4 adjectives** for Personality, comma-separated
4. **At least 3 Mission Areas** under Core Mission
5. **At least 3 Output Formats** — these must be concrete, usable templates
6. **5 Example Use Cases** — realistic student prompts, in quotes
7. **Under 500 lines** per skill — aim for 150-300 lines
8. **No university-specific references** — keep universal
9. **Description frontmatter must be "pushy"** — include many trigger phrases so the skill activates readily
10. **Agent names are CamelCase compounds**: CampaignStrategist, ScreenwriterAssistant, PodcastProducer, etc.

---

## Skill Writing Voice Guide

### Tone
- **Expert but approachable**: Like a senior creative director mentoring a junior — not a textbook
- **Action-oriented**: "Build..." "Develop..." "Create..." not "Consider..." "Think about..."
- **Industry-authentic**: Use real industry terminology, real frameworks, real output formats
- **Constructively demanding**: Push for quality. "Every headline needs a reason to exist" not "try to write good headlines"

### What Makes AlterLab Skills Different
1. **Agentic execution**: Skills autonomously research, create files, and iterate — not just advise
2. **Production-ready outputs**: File-based deliverables (scripts, briefs, reports, decks) written directly to the project
3. **Workflow-native**: Skills mirror real professional workflows with explicit tool usage at each step
4. **Format-precise**: Output formats are specified exactly (e.g., "Logline: protagonist + goal + obstacle + stakes, max 30 words")
5. **Opinionated**: Skills have a point of view on craft ("Subtext is everything. Characters rarely say what they mean.")
6. **Research-driven**: Every deliverable starts with web research for current data, trends, and benchmarks
7. **Self-reviewing**: Agents re-read their own output and assess quality before presenting
8. **Memory-aware**: Each agent "remembers" patterns and builds expertise over time

## Generation Instructions for Claude Code

When asked to generate skills, follow this exact process:

### Step 1: Create Directory Structure
```bash
mkdir -p skills/pra skills/cdm skills/nmc skills/genai skills/vcd skills/rma
for dept in pra cdm nmc genai vcd rma; do
  # Create each skill folder from the registry
done
```

### Step 2: Generate Each Skill
For each skill in the registry above:
1. Create the folder: `skills/{dept}/alterlab-{dept}-{name}/`
2. Write `SKILL.md` following the MANDATORY TEMPLATE exactly
3. Ensure the skill is **150-300 lines**, **production-ready**, and **universally applicable**
4. Include **real industry frameworks**, **real output templates**, and **real workflow steps**
5. Write **5 example use cases** that sound like actual student requests

### Step 3: Generate in Batch
When generating, produce skills in batches of 6 (one department at a time, split in two rounds). After each batch:
- Verify frontmatter is valid YAML
- Verify emoji headers are present and in order
- Verify agent name matches registry
- Verify line count is 150-300

### Step 4: Quality Checks
After all 72 skills are generated:
1. Run a line count check: `wc -l skills/*/*/SKILL.md`
2. Verify all 72 folders exist: `find skills -name "SKILL.md" | wc -l`
3. Grep for university-specific references (should find NONE): `grep -ri "ieu\|izmir\|ekonomi" skills/`
4. Verify frontmatter: `head -8 skills/*/*/SKILL.md`

## Important Notes

1. **No placeholder content.** Every skill must be complete and immediately usable. If a section feels generic, rewrite it with specific frameworks, real terminology, and concrete output templates.

2. **Industry authenticity matters.** A screenwriting skill must know proper screenplay format. A media planning skill must know CPM, GRP, and flighting. A podcast skill must know RSS, show notes, and episode structure. Research the domain if needed.

3. **Students are the users.** Write for someone who is learning the craft but wants professional-grade guidance. Not dumbed down, not academic jargon — expert mentorship.

4. **Each skill is standalone.** It must work without any other skill loaded. No cross-references to other skills in the pack.

5. **The description field is the trigger.** Make it comprehensive with many natural-language trigger phrases. This is how Claude decides to activate the skill.
