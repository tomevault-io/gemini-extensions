# Project agent memory

backpass is an npm CLI that runs a "backward pass" over a repo's agent memory files: it
discovers past agent-session transcripts tied to the repo, analyzes them, and proposes
evidence-backed edits to `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` under a token budget.

## Orientation

- `README.md` documents the user-facing surface; `src/cli.js` is the authoritative flag list.
- The pipeline is one stage per module, in order: `src/discovery/` -> `src/sample.js` (cap) -> `src/distill.js` ->
  `src/analyze.js` -> `src/fold.js` -> `src/synthesize.js` (with `src/workspace.js` + `src/diff.js`) ->
  `src/proposal.js` -> `src/apply/`. Each module's header comment explains its role; read those
  before changing a stage.
- **User-facing step names are the training-loop terms**, not the module names: discover =
  "collect samples", analyze = "calculate loss", fold = "aggregate gradients", synthesize =
  "gradient descent" (`STAGE_LABELS` in `src/tui/render.js`). Internal keys, event names, and
  the typed subcommands (`scan`, `analyze`, `propose`) keep their short names; only what the
  user reads changes. Never introduce a multi-word subcommand.
- Zero runtime dependencies, ESM, no build step. Node >= 22.5 (for `node:sqlite`).
- pnpm is the package manager; `pnpm run check` runs lint, format:check, typecheck, and
  tests. All tests are offline and use fixtures under `test/fixtures/`. Supply-chain
  settings (release-age cooldown, build-script deny) live in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`.
- Releases are automated by release-please (`.github/workflows/release-please.yml`,
  npm trusted publishing). Never hand-edit `CHANGELOG.md` or
  `.release-please-manifest.json`; CI guards reject PRs that touch them.
- `.github/workflows/no-mistakes-required.yml` is a thin caller of the shared
  `kunchenguid/no-mistakes/.github/actions/require-no-mistakes` composite action, pinned
  to an immutable commit SHA and never `@main`. Enforcement logic and tests live upstream
  in the no-mistakes repository; change enforcement there, never by copying it locally,
  and bump the pin in a deliberate separate PR. This repo still owns the `on:`,
  `concurrency`, `permissions`, job name, and author-exemption `if:`. The action binds the
  attestation to the head SHA, so a PR whose body no-mistakes did not rewrite for the
  current head goes red by contract: push through `git push no-mistakes`.

## Sharp edges

- **Transcript formats are undocumented and drift.** Every adapter in
  `src/discovery/adapters/` is pinned by a golden fixture in `test/fixtures/`. When a
  harness changes its on-disk shape, fix the adapter and update its fixture together.
  Adapters must stay fail-soft: an unreadable store warns and is skipped, never throws.
- **The live progress view is an enhancement layer, never a dependency.** Pipeline stages
  emit events through `src/progress.js`; `src/tui/` renders them on stderr during the
  default run and buffers/replays the plain logger lines on teardown. Every path must
  behave identically when it is inactive (non-TTY, CI, NO_COLOR, --quiet, --json) - plain
  line output on stderr and clean stdout are the contract. Rendering logic stays pure
  (`src/tui/render.js`) so it is testable as text.
- **`src/apply/writer.js` is the only module that writes to the repo.** Keep it that way -
  every other stage is read-only analysis, which is what makes a run safe to interrupt.
  Bootstrap (`src/commands/bootstrap.js`, a repo with no memory file) is the one run that
  writes without the apply gate, and it only ever creates files, never overwrites.
- **Synthesis edits natively, in a staging copy, never by describing text.** The agent
  gets `--approve-all` with `cwd` = `.backpass/synthesis/` (`prepareWorkspace`), which holds
  only the memory file and the skills dir; backpass measures the copy (`measureWorkspace`,
  `anchoredHunks`) and the agent annotates the measured changes by id in a second turn of
  the same session. The model never supplies `find` text - every hunk is cut from the raw
  file, widened until unique, so "find text does not appear" cannot recur. Never pass
  `approveAll` with the repo as `cwd`; the repo is fingerprinted and a harness that
  writes there fails the run loudly.
- **Skills only count if a harness loads them.** Extractions target `.agents/skills` with
  `.claude/skills -> ../.agents/skills` as a symlink (`ensureSkillsLayout` in
  `src/skills.js`, run at write time); a bare `skills/` dir is never auto-detected and a
  real `.claude/skills` directory is warned about, never replaced.
- **Memory resolution is pointer-aware** (`resolveMemoryFiles` in `src/memory.js`): the
  first configured file is canonical, a `@AGENTS.md`-only CLAUDE.md is a pointer, and a
  second full file is warned about, never silently ignored or double-written.
- **Never trust model-reported numbers.** Token deltas and budget projections are measured
  in `src/proposal.js` from the actual text; the synthesis model's own figures are ignored.
  Usage accounting comes from acpx's `[acpx] tokens:` stderr line, which acpx prints
  when the ACP adapter returns usage (codex, claude do; pi-acp does not), with one
  harness-store fallback: pi's per-turn usage is read back from its own session file,
  located by the prompt text (`recoverUsageFromStore` in `src/acpx.js`). Records are
  `{ agent, usage|null }` (`usageRecord` in `src/acpx.js`) and `src/commands/usage.js` is
  the one place that prints them - never `n/a`: nothing when no call ran, the harness by
  name when it stayed silent.
- **Gap corroboration is counted across runs through `.backpass/gap-ledger.json`**
  (`src/gap-ledger.js`, wired in `foldForRun`): one sighting per (gap, transcript id), so a
  session never counts twice and a gap seen once per run still graduates at `minGapEvidence`.
  Record this run's evidence _before_ pruning - old evidence files stay on disk and would
  re-add an expired or covered sighting otherwise. Uncorroborated gaps stay hidden; never
  surface singletons to the prompt or report.
- **backpass must never analyze itself.** Its own acpx calls are filed by each harness
  under the repo's cwd, a tier-1 match. Every prompt starts with `SELF_SESSION_SENTINEL`
  (`src/prompts.js`) and discovery drops transcripts whose first user message begins with
  it (`src/discovery/self.js`) before sampling. Keep the sentinel on every model-facing
  prompt; the triviality filter is not a substitute.
- **acpx is alpha.** All model invocation is isolated behind `src/acpx.js` so an upstream
  CLI change has one blast radius. v1 uses plain `exec` and named sessions only; acpx flows
  are deferred until they are stable upstream. The one sanctioned exception is the
  per-harness native status table in `src/agents.js` (`claude auth status`, `opencode models`).
- **Agent auto-pick is probe-then-verify, never probe-only.** `src/agents.js` walks each
  role's ladder with a zero-token probe, but the claude adapter cannot be pre-verified by
  acpx (sessions succeed while logged out), so every real call runs under
  `AgentResolver.withFallthrough`, which demotes a candidate on a classifiable failure
  (`classifyAcpxFailure`). Reasoning effort is a per-adapter session option
  (`EFFORT_OPTION_KEYS`), so effortful calls always go through `sessionPrompt`. Verdicts
  cache in `.backpass/agent-probe-cache.json`.
- **The Lavish apply surface is chatty and its output is YAML-quoted.** `lavish-axi poll`
  can return feedback that is not a decision vector (a comment, a queued layout report) any
  number of times before the real one; `pollDecisions` in `src/apply/lavish.js` announces
  each wait state once and never per cycle. Session URLs are printed as `url: "http://..."`,
  so parse them with `extractUrl`, never a bare `\S+`. Browser launch is best effort
  (`src/apply/browser.js`): the printed URL is the contract. `test/fixtures/fake-lavish/`
  stands in for the CLI via `BACKPASS_LAVISH_BIN` in tests.
- Cursor IDE support is deliberately deferred to v1.1 (`--include-cursor-ide`, best effort);
  see the header of `src/discovery/adapters/cursor-ide.js` for why.

## Maintaining this file

Keep this file for knowledge useful to almost every future agent session in this project.
Do not repeat what the codebase already shows; point to the authoritative file or command instead.
Prefer rewriting or pruning existing entries over appending new ones.
When updating this file, preserve this bar for all agents and keep entries concise.
