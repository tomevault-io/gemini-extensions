# Copilot Instructions

- Project: Next.js 15 app deployed via AWS Amplify; auth is NextAuth (email + SIWE) with DynamoDB adapter, membership is Unlock Protocol on Base, UI uses shadcn + Tailwind CLI.
- Front door: Home screen is client-only in [app/home-client.tsx](app/home-client.tsx); it orchestrates membership/NFT queries, Unlock checkouts, and Base network prompts via React Query + `useUnlockCheckout`. SSR no longer prefetches membership/NFTs in `app/page.tsx`; it only passes session membership status/expiry to avoid reload delays.
- Membership model: Source of truth is on-chain locks from `NEXT_PUBLIC_LOCK_TIERS`; state is derived/cached in [lib/membership-state-service.ts](lib/membership-state-service.ts) and normalized by `snapshotToMembershipSummary` in [lib/membership-server.ts](lib/membership-server.ts). Prefer client-side React Query caching for Home; invalidate via `/api/membership/invalidate` after checkout.
- Checkout targets: Lock/tier metadata come from [lib/checkout-config.ts](lib/checkout-config.ts) fed by env vars (`NEXT_PUBLIC_LOCK_TIERS`, optional recurring/referrer settings). Event locks are discovered on-chain, and `getMembershipCheckoutTarget` / `getEventCheckoutTarget` should be used instead of hardcoding addresses.
- Wallet flows: Keep users on Base (see network switch helper in home-client) before approvals; cap USDC approvals to 12 months and reject unlimited caps (`SAFE_ALLOWANCE_CAP`). Prefer `extendKey` over `purchaseKey` when a tokenId exists.
- Token IDs: Subgraph preferred (`UNLOCK_SUBGRAPH_URL` or `UNLOCK_SUBGRAPH_API_KEY` + `UNLOCK_SUBGRAPH_ID`); fallback enumerates `tokenOfOwnerByIndex` with small caps. If no tokenId is resolvable, block renewal to avoid max-keys reverts.
- Membership caching: In-memory service caches per addresses+chain for ~3m with variants for allowances/tokenIds; `forceRefresh` or `invalidate` when side effects occur. Queries should scope by normalized, comma-joined addresses.
- Auto-renew UX: Allowance prompts live in home-client; approvals use computed target months (defaults to 12) and hide prompts when allowance is present or non-renewable/never-expires tiers are selected.
- NFTs/events: `/api/nfts` aggregates owned/missed/upcoming creator NFTs on Base, merging Alchemy metadata when available; Home loads NFTs client-side via `useMemberNfts` and relies on React Query cache (Profile page may prefetch into the cache).
- Event details: Upcoming meetings link to `/events/[lockAddress]`, which fetches metadata from `GET /api/events/details?lockAddress=` and handles sponsored RSVP with Unlock checkout fallback for paid events.
- Event token metadata (Option C): Public tokenURI responses are served by `GET /api/events/metadata/{lockAddress}/{tokenId}` using `EVENT_METADATA_TABLE`. Set each event lock's base tokenURI to `https://<site>/api/events/metadata/<lockAddress>/` via `scripts/setup/set-event-token-uri.mjs`.
- Auth/session: NextAuth v4 in `app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts` (email magic link via SES SMTP + SIWE credentials). Session is JWT enriched with profile fields and membership snapshots; wallet linking uses `/api/auth/link-wallet` and `/api/auth/unlink-wallet`.
- Signup flow: Wallet-first signup persists `{ email, wallet }` via `/api/signup/pending`, then links on email verification in NextAuth callback; legacy email-first flow still redirects to `/signin` with banners.
- Profile data: Stored via NextAuth in DynamoDB; fields include first/last name, xHandle, linkedinUrl. Settings/Profile UI lets users link/unlink wallets.
- Admin surface: Admin pages under [app/admin](app/admin) and components in [components/admin](components/admin) handle roster views, refunds, emails, and cache resets; ensure routes verify auth/membership and planned admin role flag.
- Admin roster cache: Uses a separate DynamoDB cache table (`ADMIN_ROSTER_CACHE_TABLE`) with meta + paged roster items and a short-lived lock. `GET /api/admin/members` supports `preferStale=1` and `triggerRebuild=1` to return stale data quickly and kick off rebuilds; `GET /api/admin/members/status` returns cache metadata for polling. `/admin` no longer builds the roster on SSR to avoid Amplify timeouts. A standalone SAM Lambda in `infra/admin-roster-rebuild` now handles background rebuilds (scheduled + manual), triggered via `/api/admin/members/rebuild` using `ADMIN_ROSTER_REBUILD_URL` + `ADMIN_ROSTER_REBUILD_SECRET`.
- Admin roster data/UI: Member "joined" date is derived from the lowest (Member) tier lock via Unlock subgraph `createdAtBlock` + Base RPC block timestamps when building the cached roster. The Admin member table now filters by tier level and sorts by last name/joined/expiry; wallets/balances/email details are hidden behind per-member expand toggles with manual detail refresh.
- Admin test members: User records may include `isTestMember` (boolean). Admin actions can toggle this flag; test members are hidden from the roster by default and only shown when the "Test members" filter is selected.
- Styling/UI: Tailwind CLI builds `src/output.css` from `src/input.css`; shadcn components live in `components/ui/*`. Glassmorphic accents appear on alerts/panels in home-client; match existing class patterns when extending.
- Testing: Use Vitest + Testing Library (`npm test`). Storybook v8 runs with `npm run storybook`; component stories reside in `components/home/*.stories.tsx`.
- Builds: `npm run build` runs Tailwind CLI then `next build`; local dev via `npm run dev`. Node 22 is required (see package engines).
- Environment: Keep server-only secrets unprefixed (e.g., `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`, RPC keys). Public vars start with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`. Amplify injects env per branch; do not commit secrets.
- RPC hygiene: `BASE_RPC_URL` is required server-side; client uses `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_RPC_URL`. Enable RPC debug logs with `RPC_DEBUG=true` to print provider info at startup in membership service.
- Error handling: Treat 429/503 as throttling in membership service; retries and batch delays are built-in for allowances. Surface user-rejected errors distinctly in wallet flows.
- Patterns to follow: Normalize addresses to lowercase, prefer checksum storage when available; avoid direct fetches—use shared hooks (`useMembership`, `useMemberNfts`, `useEventRegistration`, `useUnlockCheckout`). Scope React Query keys with `addressesKey` and feature flags.
- Deploy: Amplify pipeline defined in [amplify.yml](amplify.yml); pushes trigger builds, PRs create previews. Ensure DynamoDB + SES IAM permissions are available.
- Licensing: Dual MIT or Apache-2.0; see root LICENSE files.
