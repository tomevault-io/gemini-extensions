TrendCraft - Technical analysis library for TypeScript (pnpm workspace monorepo)

## Project Overview

A library for analyzing financial data (stocks, crypto, etc.).
Provides technical indicators, signal detection, backtesting, and optimization.
`@trendcraft/chart` provides a Canvas-based charting library with auto-detection of TrendCraft indicator series, framework bindings (React/Vue), and a headless API.

## Development Commands

```bash
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile   # Install dependencies (workspace)
pnpm test                        # Run tests (all packages)
pnpm build                       # Build (all packages)
pnpm lint                        # Biome lint
pnpm format                      # Biome format
```

**Install note**: Prefer `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` over a plain `pnpm install`, especially in a fresh `git worktree`. A plain install has in practice produced an incomplete dependency graph in a new worktree — vue/react types failed to resolve inside vite-plugin-dts (TS2305 errors during `pnpm build`) — even though the lockfile was reported as "up to date". `--frozen-lockfile` refuses to modify the lockfile and in that situation produced a clean, consistent install.

### Package-level commands

```bash
cd packages/core
pnpm test         # Run core tests (vitest)
pnpm build        # Build core (vite)
```

```bash
cd packages/chart
pnpm test         # Run chart tests (vitest, 19 test files)
pnpm build        # Build chart (vite)
pnpm dev          # Dev server with examples
pnpm size-check   # Check bundle size limits (esbuild, brotli-compressed)
```

## General Rules

- Always use English for all code comments, labels, UI text, README files, and documentation unless explicitly told otherwise
- Before making any code changes, confirm understanding of the user's intent. Do not modify code to 'fix' something unless explicitly asked. When the user asks a question about current state, answer the question first — do not preemptively change code

## Code Quality

- If a single file exceeds 500 lines, suggest splitting it into focused modules before adding more code
- All indicators return `Series<T>` type (`{ time: number, value: T }[]`)
- Uses Wilder's smoothing method (RSI, ATR, etc.)
- Functions should have JSDoc comments with @example
- `@trendcraft/chart`: Bundle size limits enforced via `size-limit` + `@size-limit/esbuild` (brotli-compressed). Main ≤ 31 kB, Headless ≤ 11 kB, React/Vue ≤ 27 kB. Zero runtime dependencies; `trendcraft`, `react`, `vue` are optional peer deps

## Testing & Validation

- Always run `pnpm build` (or the equivalent type-check command) after making changes to verify the build passes before reporting completion
- For chart-viewer changes: `cd packages/core/examples/chart-viewer && npx tsc --noEmit`

## Chart-Viewer Development (packages/core/examples/chart-viewer/)

> **Note:** This section refers to `packages/core/examples/chart-viewer/` (ECharts-based demo app), not the `@trendcraft/chart` package.

- After implementing new indicators or features that have UI settings, always check and update the Indicator Settings UI groups/panels (`IndicatorSettingsDialog.tsx`) to include the new entries. Never assume the UI will auto-discover new indicators
- When implementing chart/ECharts features, be careful with layout calculations: always account for labelHeight, title heights, margins, and dataZoom positioning. Test visual elements don't overlap. Overlay indicators go on the main chart (not as subcharts) unless explicitly specified otherwise

## Git Workflow

- When generating commit messages, wait for the user to confirm intent before proceeding. For large changesets, proactively suggest splitting into logical commits with file groupings

## Release Workflow

This is a pnpm workspace monorepo with two independently published packages. Treat their versions and releases as independent; only the repository is shared.

### Tag naming

Use prefix-dash form so each package's tags are filterable (`git tag -l 'chart-*'`):

- `core-v<major>.<minor>.<patch>` — e.g. `core-v0.2.0`
- `chart-v<major>.<minor>.<patch>` — e.g. `chart-v0.1.0`

The legacy tag `v0.1.0` (no prefix) points to the first `trendcraft` release and is kept as-is. Do not reuse the unprefixed `v*` form for new releases.

### Release order (always serial)

When a change spans both packages (chart relies on core's new API), release must be serial to avoid peer dep drift:

1. Merge all changes to `main`
2. Finalize `packages/core/CHANGELOG.md` — promote `Unreleased` to the new version with a concrete date
3. Bump `packages/core/package.json` version
4. Tag `core-v<x.y.z>` on that commit, push tag, run `pnpm publish` for core
5. Wait for `npm view trendcraft@<x.y.z> version` to resolve
6. Update `packages/chart/package.json` peer dep minimum to the just-published core version if chart uses new core APIs
7. Finalize `packages/chart/CHANGELOG.md` — fill in the date
8. Bump `packages/chart/package.json` version
9. Tag `chart-v<x.y.z>`, push tag, run `pnpm publish` for chart

Do not publish chart first when it depends on unreleased core APIs; the `workspace:*` link hides the missing peer until users actually install from npm.

### Peer dep hygiene

- `@trendcraft/chart`'s peer on `trendcraft` must be `>=<latest-core-using-APIs-we-call>`. Bump it whenever chart starts calling a newly-added core symbol.
- Keep the peer a `>=` range, not an exact pin — users should be able to pick up core patch releases freely.

### Versioning (SemVer under 0.x)

- Pre-1.0, minor bumps (`0.x.0`) are allowed to carry breaking changes; patch bumps (`0.x.y`) must be backward compatible.
- API surface changes that are purely additive still warrant a minor bump when the surface meaningfully grows (e.g. a whole new entry point, 50+ new exports).
- Rename/remove of a previously-exported symbol = minor bump (documented in CHANGELOG's "Breaking" subsection). A symbol that was never exported in a published version is not breaking.

### CHANGELOG convention

- Keep an `Unreleased` / draft section at the top while work is in flight. Promote to a versioned heading at release time with a concrete date.
- One CHANGELOG per package (`packages/core/CHANGELOG.md`, `packages/chart/CHANGELOG.md`). Do not maintain a root CHANGELOG.
- Commit messages can be terse; the CHANGELOG is the user-facing surface and should be written for consumers, not reviewers.

### Pre-release (optional)

For the first coupled release of core + chart, or any time the API contract between the two is in doubt, consider `core-v0.x.0-rc.0` / `chart-v0.x.0-rc.0` on npm's `next` dist-tag first, verify integration against the real registry, then promote to stable.

// Headless (no DOM)
import { DataLayer, TimeScale, PriceScale, introspect, lttb } from "@trendcraft/chart/headless";

## examples/

### packages/core/examples/

- `chart-viewer/` - Simple chart visualization tool (ECharts-based)
- `trading-simulator/` - React-based trading simulator with backtesting
- `alpaca-demo/` - Multi-agent paper trading system (Alpaca API)
- `candle-former-demo/` - CandleFormer demo

### packages/chart/examples/

- `simple-chart/` - Vanilla TypeScript chart with indicators, drawings, plugins
- `simple-react-chart/` - React wrapper usage
- `simple-vue-chart/` - Vue wrapper usage

## Alpaca Demo

- Type check: `cd packages/core/examples/alpaca-demo && npx tsc --noEmit`
- **pnpm 7+ does NOT need `--` to pass arguments to scripts.** Use `pnpm run dev <command> [options]` directly, not `pnpm run dev -- <command>`. The `--` gets forwarded literally and breaks commander's subcommand parsing.
