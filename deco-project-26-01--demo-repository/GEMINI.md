# CLAUDE.md — Jewel-Trade (B2B Jewel-Mall)

This file provides context for AI assistants (Claude, Copilot, etc.) working on this repository. Keep it updated as the project evolves.

---

## Project Overview

**Jewel-Trade** is a B2B precious-metals export company platform built for **Deco Indco**. It replaces manual Excel-based invoicing and messenger-based order management with a web-based Order Management System (OMS).

- **Type:** B2B e-commerce / OMS
- **Audience:** Overseas buyers and internal admins
- **Languages:** Korean (primary team language), English (single supported UI language)
- **Timeline:** 8 weeks; currently in early development (core features starting weeks 4–7)

### Business Context

| Problem (As-Is) | Solution (To-Be) |
|---|---|
| Orders received via messenger | Web-based order/quote request |
| Manual Excel invoice creation | Auto-generated PDF invoices |
| No order status visibility | Real-time order lifecycle tracking |

---

## Build & Run Commands

All commands run from the `demo/` directory.

```bash
# Build the project
./gradlew build

# Run all tests
./gradlew test

# Run the application (dev mode with hot reload)
./gradlew bootRun

# Clean build artifacts and QueryDSL generated sources
./gradlew clean

# Build without running tests
./gradlew build -x test
```

QueryDSL Q-classes are auto-generated to `demo/src/main/generated/` during compilation and cleaned by `./gradlew clean`.

---

## Configuration

### application.properties
Currently minimal. Environment-specific values should be injected at runtime via environment variables or Spring profiles.

Required environment variables (not yet in `.env.example` — create one):
```
SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/jeweltrade
SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME=
SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD=
SPRING_DATA_REDIS_HOST=
SPRING_DATA_REDIS_PORT=6379
SPRING_MAIL_HOST=
SPRING_MAIL_USERNAME=
SPRING_MAIL_PASSWORD=
JWT_SECRET=
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
```

### Spring Security
File: `demo/src/main/java/com/deco/demo/SecurityConfig.java`

- CSRF is **disabled** (convenience for testing — re-enable before production)
- Swagger endpoints (`/v3/api-docs/**`, `/swagger-ui/**`) are public
- All other endpoints require authentication
- Successful form login redirects to `/swagger-ui/index.html`

---

## MVP Feature Scope

### In Scope
| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| Company branding | Landing page: Brand, Catalog, How We Work, About Us, Contact |
| Authentication | Email login for Admin + Buyer; Google OAuth2 (if time permits) |
| Order Management | Cart/Quote → Order Request → Invoice → T/T payment confirmation → Shipping → Complete |
| PDF Invoice | Auto-generated on order approval; downloadable |
| Admin panel | User (CRUD), Product (CRUD), Order approval |
| Infrastructure | AWS deployment + domain connection |

### Out of Scope
- PG payment gateway (T/T bank transfer used instead)
- Real-time inventory / ERP integration
- Multi-language support

### Order Lifecycle
```
접수 (Received)
  → 인보이스 발행 (Invoice Issued)
  → T/T 입금 확인 (T/T Payment Confirmed — receipt upload by buyer)
  → 배송 중 (Shipping)
  → 완료 (Complete)
```

### Access Control
- Buyers must be granted purchase permission by an admin after registration
- Admin role: full CRUD + order approval + invoice generation
- Buyer role: browse catalog, manage cart, submit orders, upload payment receipts, track order status

---

## API Documentation

Swagger UI is available at `/swagger-ui.html` (or `/swagger-ui/index.html`) when the application is running. OpenAPI spec at `/v3/api-docs`.

By default, Swagger UI and the OpenAPI docs are publicly accessible without authentication because `/swagger-ui/**`, `/swagger-ui.html`, and `/v3/api-docs/**` are permitted in `SecurityConfig`. If you change security settings, update this section accordingly.

---

## Testing

### Framework
- JUnit 5 (Jupiter) via `useJUnitPlatform()`
- Spring Boot Test (`@SpringBootTest`)
- Spring Security Test
- H2 in-memory database for test isolation

### Running Tests
```bash
./gradlew test
```

### Current Coverage
- `DemoApplicationTests.contextLoads()` — verifies Spring context initializes without error

New tests should mirror the `src/main/java` package structure under `src/test/java`.

---

## CI/CD (GitHub Actions)

### Workflows
| Workflow | File | Trigger | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| Proof HTML | `.github/workflows/proof-html.yml` | Every push + manual dispatch | Validates HTML syntax in repo |
| Auto Assign | `.github/workflows/auto-assign.yml` | Issue/PR opened | Auto-assigns to `ksh322` |

---

## Git Workflow & Conventions

### Branch Strategy
- **Never** commit directly to `main`/`master`
- All work happens on **personal feature branches**
- Merge into `main` via **Pull Request only**, after code review

### Commit Message Format
```
<type>: <description>

Types:
  feat    — new feature
  fix     — bug fix
  style   — formatting only (no logic change)
  docs    — documentation updates
  chore   — build scripts, config, dependency updates
```

**Examples:**
```
feat: 사용자 로그인 기능 추가
fix: 메인 페이지 이미지 깨짐 현상 수정
docs: README.md 내용 업데이트
chore: .gitignore 파일 업데이트
```

### Code Review
PRs must pass review by a mentor or team lead before merging to `main`. Copilot / AI code review is also encouraged.

## Key Conventions for AI Assistants

1. **Java style:** Use Lombok annotations (`@Getter`, `@Builder`, etc.) to reduce boilerplate. Follow existing package separation (`com.example.demo` vs `com.deco.demo`).

2. **Security:** Do not remove or weaken Spring Security configuration. CSRF is currently disabled for development — flag this if touching security code.

3. **QueryDSL:** Q-classes live in `src/main/generated/` and are gitignored. Do not commit generated Q-classes. Reference them as `QEntity` in queries.

4. **Database:** Use JPA + QueryDSL for queries. Prefer Spring Data repositories for simple CRUD; use QueryDSL for complex dynamic queries.

5. **API design:** All APIs should be documented via Swagger annotations. Follow RESTful conventions.

6. **Validation:** Use `@Valid` + Bean Validation annotations (`@NotNull`, `@Size`, etc.) on request DTOs.

7. **Error handling:** Implement `@ControllerAdvice` / `@RestControllerAdvice` for global exception handling.

8. **Redis:** Used for JWT blacklisting on logout and session management. Do not store sensitive data in Redis without TTL.

9. **Documentation:** Update this file when adding major features, changing architecture, or establishing new conventions. Key areas to document: business logic, API endpoints, concurrency controls, session expiry behavior.

10. **Language:** Code and comments may be in Korean or English. Prefer English for code identifiers; Korean is acceptable in comments and documentation.
