## Binance Skills Integration

This skill orchestrates all 7 official Binance AI Agent Skills:

### 1. CEX Spot Trading Skill
**Used for:** Real-time market data (tickers, depth, candlesticks) and trade execution (market/limit/OCO orders).

```bash
# Fetch current BTC price
curl -s "https://api.binance.com/api/v3/ticker/price?symbol=BTCUSDT" | jq '.price'

# Fetch orderbook depth (15 levels)
curl -s "https://api.binance.com/api/v3/depth?symbol=BTCUSDT&limit=15" | jq '.'

# Fetch all tickers for triangle scanning
curl -s "https://api.binance.com/api/v3/ticker/bookTicker" | jq '.'

# Place testnet order (HMAC-SHA256 signed)
TIMESTAMP=$(date +%s%3N)
QUERY="symbol=BTCUSDT&side=BUY&type=MARKET&quoteOrderQty=8&timestamp=${TIMESTAMP}"
SIGNATURE=$(echo -n "${QUERY}" | openssl dgst -sha256 -hmac "${BINANCE_SECRET}" | cut -d' ' -f2)
curl -s -X POST "https://testnet.binance.vision/api/v3/order?${QUERY}&signature=${SIGNATURE}" \
  -H "X-MBX-APIKEY: ${BINANCE_API_KEY}" | jq '.'
```

### 2. Address Insight Skill
**Used for:** Whale tracking — monitor large wallet movements that could affect triangle spreads.

```bash
# Analyze a whale wallet for holdings and concentration
# Used by EconoPredator module to detect institutional flow
```

### 3. Token Details Skill
**Used for:** Validate token liquidity and trading pairs before including in triangle paths.

### 4. Market Rankings Skill
**Used for:** Dynamic pair selection — auto-select top pairs by volume/volatility for optimal triangle discovery.

### 5. Meme Rush Skill
**Used for:** Detect sudden meme coin surges that create temporary arbitrage dislocations across pairs.

### 6. Trading Signals Skill
**Used for:** Confluence layer — cross-reference APEX signals with Binance's own signal engine for higher confidence.

### 7. Token Contract Audit Skill
**Used for:** Anti-rug module — audit token contracts before including new pairs in triangle scan paths.

---

## 7 AI Modules

### 🧠 ConfluenceEngine — 6-Layer Signal Filter
Before any trade executes, the signal must pass ALL 6 filters:

1. **Tire Pressure** — Measures bid-ask spread compression as a proxy for execution certainty
2. **Lead-Lag Detection** — Identifies which pair in the triangle moves first (information advantage)
3. **Fake Momentum Filter** — Rejects signals driven by wash trading or artificial volume
4. **OI Consistency** — Cross-references Open Interest data to confirm real market conviction
5. **OI Delta/Volume Ratio** — Ensures volume is organic and not inflated by derivatives hedging
6. **Post-Spike Reversal** — Avoids entering after sharp moves that are likely to mean-revert

### 🛡️ Robin Hood Risk Engine
Zero-tolerance capital protection:
- **Hard drawdown limit:** 4% max → triggers 30-minute total freeze
- **Per-trade limit:** $8 max (configurable via `APEX_MAX_TRADE`)
- **No override possible** — survival logic is non-negotiable
- **Auto-recovery:** Resumes scanning after cooldown period

### 👁️ SpoofHunter — L2 Defense
Real-time Level 2 orderbook analysis:
- Detects ghost orders (large orders placed then cancelled within 200ms)
- Identifies fake walls and layering patterns
- Flags wash trading activity
- **Any signal contaminated by spoof activity is automatically rejected**

### 📊 EconoPredator — Macro Intelligence
Monitors external factors that affect crypto volatility:
- CPI/FOMC/NFP economic calendar events
- Funding rates across major pairs
- Open Interest shifts
- Long/Short ratio imbalances
- On-chain whale flows (via Address Insight Skill)

### 📡 Active Position Manager (APM)
Real-time position monitoring at 100ms intervals:
- **VPIN** (Volume-Synchronized Probability of Informed Trading) tracking
- **Alpha Decay** measurement — auto-exits when edge deteriorates
- Partial fill detection with atomic rollback

### 💰 Auto-Earn Hook
Idle capital optimization:
- Sweeps profits > $0.10 into Binance Simple Earn
- Finds highest APR product automatically
- Capital generates passive yield 24/7 between trades

### 🌐 Distributed Executor Network
Multi-region execution architecture:
- Scanner runs locally (your machine / Curitiba node)
- Redis Pub/Sub broadcasts signals with nanosecond timestamps
- Singapore + Tokyo executors for <10ms latency to Binance matching engine
- Atomic state machine with rollback on partial fills
