## Key patterns

**State machine** — `app.py` uses `_State` enum protected by `_hotkey_lock`. Generation counter prevents stale finalizers from stomping newer recordings.

**Chain & probe** — Every backend implements `probe() → ProbeResult`. `chain.select()` picks the first working one. Runtime failures trigger automatic re-probe and fallback.

**Adding a backend** — Create `voiceio/typers/my_backend.py`, implement `TyperBackend` (or `StreamingTyper` for preedit), register in `__init__.py`, add to `chain.py`, add probe test.

**Hotkey deduplication** — evdev and socket both fire for the same keypress. `on_hotkey()` uses lock + 0.3s debounce.

**Streaming** — IBus path uses preedit (underlined preview) + commit. Fallback path uses word-level append with char-level diff on final.

**Incremental finalization** — during recording, once the un-frozen audio tail exceeds `output.streaming_freeze_secs` (default 15s), it is cut at the quietest interior speech pause (searched relative to the tail's own RMS — mic-gain independent), beam-decoded and frozen; interim and stop-time passes only decode the remaining tail. Long dictations finalize in O(tail) instead of O(recording) (~10x faster stop for multi-minute notes). Frozen text conditions the tail decode via per-call `context` prompt. Freeze passes never touch the display; decode failures never advance the boundary.

**Post-processing pipeline** — `postprocess.apply_pipeline()` is the single shared pipeline: cleanup → numbers → commands → corrections → LLM (final only). Used by both streaming and batch modes.

**LLM integration** — Optional Ollama-based grammar/spelling cleanup. Runs on final pass only (never during streaming). `llm.py` has shared helpers (install, start, pull, diagnose) used by wizard, doctor, and app.

**Tray icon** — Pre-rendered PNG frames in freedesktop icon theme. AppIndicator3 subprocess under system Python (avoids GTK/venv conflicts). Phase-matched transitions between states. App works fine without it.

## Code style

- `ruff check voiceio/` (runs in CI)
- Python 3.11+, type hints on public APIs
- [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) (feat/fix/refactor/docs/test/ci/chore)
- DRY: reuse existing utilities and patterns before writing new code
- Only validate at system boundaries, trust internal code
- Comments only where logic isn't self-evident

## Testing

```bash
uv run pytest tests/ -x -q
```

- Mock external deps (audio, subprocesses, /dev/input)
- Use `spec=TyperBackend` on MagicMock (Python 3.11 protocol quirk)
- Test race conditions with `threading.Event` + timeouts

## Pull requests

**Low quality spam PRs without a linked issue might be be closed.** Open an issue first, discuss the approach, get a thumbs-up, then submit code. This applies to AI-generated and human contributions equally.

- Link the issue in your PR description (`Fixes #123`)
- All tests must pass (`uv run pytest tests/ -x -q`)
- Add tests for new backends or bug fixes
- One logical change per PR

## Model choice: why Whisper, and what would change it

Short version: **Parakeet is faster and we still don't use it.** If you're about
to open "switch to Parakeet / Canary / Moonshine, it's Nx faster" — read this
first, then open the issue anyway if you have data that contradicts it.

Our errors are almost entirely proper nouns and jargon (`HyperNEAT` →
`hyperneed`, `Kalshi` → `kalchi`). So the axis that matters is **contextual
biasing**, not raw WER or speed. Whisper's only lever is `hotwords`, and it is
small and hard-capped: faster-whisper truncates hotwords at 223 tokens
(`max_length // 2 - 1`), they share one 448-token budget with the transcription
*output*, and proper nouns cost 5-7 tokens each — so ~35 terms, permanently.
That ceiling is architectural. There is no upstream fix coming, and it's why
`voiceio/vocabulary.py` ranks terms instead of just listing them.

**Measured on this project's own retained audio (2026-07-17, Ryzen 9 7940HS,
CPU int8)** — reproduce before trusting:

| | speed | notes |
|---|---|---|
| whisper-small (current) | 4.8x realtime | hotwords work; ~35-term ceiling |
| Parakeet-TDT-0.6b-v3 int8, greedy | **12.7x** | clean, but **greedy ignores hotwords** |
| Parakeet-TDT, `modified_beam_search` | — | **lost/truncated speech on ~8/20 real clips** |

[sherpa-onnx](https://k2-fsa.github.io/sherpa/onnx/hotwords/index.html) hotwords
are the prize: an Aho-Corasick automaton with **no token cap**, which would
delete the ~35-term ceiling entirely. But they require `modified_beam_search`
(greedy silently ignores them), and MBS on NeMo TDT is broken — see
[#3267](https://github.com/k2-fsa/sherpa-onnx/issues/3267). We reproduced it on
sherpa-onnx **1.13.4**: 3/20 clips returned empty on real speech, ~8/20 lost or
truncated it (greedy 47 words → MBS 0). A genuinely silent clip came back empty
from both, so that's real speech loss, not VAD.

So biasing and model choice are **one decision**, and today it costs 40% speech
loss. Without biasing, Parakeet recovers *fewer* of our vocabulary terms than
whisper-small does with hotwords (3 vs 5 over 20 clips). Speed is not the
bottleneck — whisper-small already runs 4.8x realtime on an 18s median
utterance.

**The trigger to revisit:** when
[PR #3657](https://github.com/k2-fsa/sherpa-onnx/pull/3657) ("Fix
modified_beam_search hallucination/empty text for NeMo TDT") merges, Parakeet
becomes faster *and* unbounded-biasing, and this decision flips. Re-run the
spike before migrating: decode ~20 real clips with greedy and MBS, compare word
counts per clip, and only proceed if MBS matches greedy. Note Parakeet is
offline-only (no true streaming) and crashes on multi-minute audio — chunk at
30s, which the freeze path already does.

## Platform notes

- **IBus** is the only reliable streaming text injection on Wayland. Keystroke simulation drops characters on rapid corrections.
- **Wayland caps a single message at 4096 bytes.** GNOME Shell relays preedit and commit strings to the focused app as one `zwp_text_input_v3` event, so an oversized string makes the compositor tear down that app's connection — it dies mid-dictation. Everything handed to IBus goes through `voiceio/ibus/textlimit.py`; never call `commit_text`/`update_preedit_text` with unbounded text.
- **evdev** requires `input` group. Multiple keyboard devices each get their own reader thread.
- **Sound** uses persistent `sounddevice.OutputStream`. WAV files padded with ~100ms silence.
- **Tray on non-Ubuntu** needs AppIndicator3 packages + GNOME Shell extension.
- **PyPI** package is `python-voiceio`, CLI is `voiceio`. Use `config.PYPI_NAME`.
