# NeuronScope - AI Assistant Configuration

## Project Overview
NeuronScope is an open-source research and visualization platform for exploring neuron activations inside transformer models (initially GPT-2, with LLaMA support planned). The project aims to provide interactive, intuitive visual insights into how transformer model neurons activate, cluster, drift, and respond to various inputs.

## Architecture & Technology Stack
- **Backend/Core**: Python 3.11+ (PyTorch, NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn)
- **Frontend/Web UI**: React with interactive plotting libraries (Plotly, D3.js)
- **Data Format**: JSON-based data exchange between backend and frontend
- **Optional**: C/Cython for performance optimization if >5x gains identified

## Development Guidelines

### Code Organization
- Follow the modular separation between backend (data generation, analysis) and frontend (interactive visual display)
- Use the defined data structures from `DATA_STRUCTURE.md` for all JSON outputs - if changes are required, please ask.
- Implement features as small, focused modules that can be completed in 1-2 prompts
- Break tasks into one-feature files to improve AI comprehension
- Do NOT make mock functions or stubs. Test data should be realistic.

### Python Backend Standards
- Use type hints for all function parameters and return values
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Include comprehensive docstrings for all functions
- Structure activation data according to the JSON schema in `DATA_STRUCTURE.md`
- Use PyTorch for GPT-2 model loading and inference
- Implement clustering using scikit-learn (K-Means initially)

### React Frontend Standards
- Use functional components with hooks
- Implement responsive design principles
- Follow the visualization guidelines from `VISUALIZATION_GUIDELINES.md`
- Use Plotly.js for interactive visualizations
- Structure components to handle the defined JSON data formats
- Implement proper error handling and loading states

### Data Flow
1. User enters prompt or selects from samples
2. Python backend runs prompt through GPT-2, extracting activations
3. Backend saves structured JSON for activations, clusters, and queries
4. React frontend loads and visualizes data via interactive components

## Key Features to Implement (in order)

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
- GPT-2 model loading and activation extraction
- Basic React app setup with routing
- JSON data structure implementation
- Sample prompt processing

### Phase 2: Visualization Core
- Neuron activation heatmaps
- Interactive scatter plots with PCA/t-SNE
- Basic clustering visualization
- Reverse activation query system

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- Neuron drift analysis across checkpoints
- Polysemantic neuron detection
- Animation support for temporal data
- CLI tools for batch processing

```

## Coding Standards

### Python
- Use virtual environments for dependency management
- Implement proper error handling for model loading and inference
- Use async/await for potentially long-running operations
- Include logging for debugging and monitoring
- Write unit tests for core functionality

### React/JavaScript
- Use modern ES6+ syntax
- Implement proper state management (useState, useContext)
- Use TypeScript for better type safety
- Follow React best practices for performance
- Implement proper error boundaries

### Visualization
- Prioritize interpretability over aesthetics
- Use consistent color schemes and styling
- Implement proper tooltips and legends
- Ensure accessibility (colorblind-friendly palettes)
- Design for scalability (small to large neuron counts)

## AI Assistant Instructions

### When Working on Backend
- Always consider the JSON output format defined in `DATA_STRUCTURE.md`
- Implement functions that can handle the sample prompts from `samples.json`
- Focus on modular, testable code that can be easily integrated
- Consider performance implications for large models or datasets

### When Working on Frontend
- Follow the visualization guidelines from `VISUALIZATION_GUIDELINES.md`
- Implement components that can handle the defined JSON data structures
- Focus on user experience and interactivity
- Ensure responsive design for different screen sizes

### When Implementing New Features
- Check the TODO.md file for specific implementation tasks
- Use the prompt templates from `PROMPTS.md` for consistent development
- Follow the design principles outlined in `DESIGN.md`
- Consider the benefits outlined in `BENEFITS.md` for feature prioritization

### Code Quality
- Write clear, self-documenting code
- Include comprehensive comments for complex logic
- Implement proper error handling and validation
- Consider edge cases and potential failure modes
- Write tests for critical functionality

## Development Workflow
1. Start with small, focused tasks from TODO.md
2. Implement backend functionality first, then frontend visualization
3. Test with sample data before integrating
4. Document any deviations from the defined data structures
5. Update relevant documentation files as features are implemented

## Performance Considerations
- Profile code before implementing optimizations
- Consider C/Cython only if substantial (>5x) performance gains are identified
- Implement caching for expensive operations (model loading, clustering)
- Use efficient data structures for large activation matrices

## Testing Strategy
- Write unit tests for core backend functions
- Test visualization components with synthetic data
- Validate JSON output against defined schemas
- Test with various prompt types and model sizes

## Documentation Requirements
- Update README.md as new features are added
- Document any API changes or new data formats
- Include usage examples for new features
- Update TODO.md as tasks are completed

Remember: This project is designed for local, single-developer use initially. Focus on getting core functionality working before adding advanced features like Dockerization or comprehensive testing frameworks.
