# CLAUDE.md: Course Console

> Wires this repo into Tjakoen's personal standards (how I build with AI, voice, badges, AI-use
> posture). The standards live publicly at `https://tjakoen.github.io/standards` (source: the
> [`standards/`](https://github.com/tjakoen/tjakoen.github.io/tree/main/standards) dir in the
> portfolio repo) - **reference them, don't fork them.** `AGENTS.md` is a symlink to this file, so any
> tool that reads the cross-tool `AGENTS.md` convention gets the same instructions.

## What this is

Course Console (this directory, formerly the standalone grader-ui repo) is the hosted management and review surface of the GitHub-Native Course Platform.
It is a **data-free GitHub Pages shell** (`site/`) that reads the teacher repos' gradebooks live from
the GitHub API in the browser, shows one grading-review dashboard, and generates the prompts an AI
runs to apply grading decisions (write grades, publish feedback, push to Canvas). The human reviews
and decides; the AI does the writing. The single most important thing to know before touching it:
**writes are tiered, and grades never bypass the review gate.** Anything touching grades, feedback,
or student-facing delivery flows only through an emitted intent prompt that a human runs in a Claude
Code session. The console's own direct writes are limited to two teacher-attested, engine-gated
kinds: filing those intent files, and committing attendance scan batch CSVs from the Scan tab
(validated server-side by the per-repo verify-attendance workflow). Keep every new mutation either
behind an intent or behind an existing dry-run-gated repo workflow - never an unreviewed in-app
grade write. (The local static build was retired 2026-07-24 in favor of the hosted shell; the
maintenance CLIs under `src/` - audit/fix/blanks - stay. The per-repo attendance scanner was
absorbed as the Scan tab 2026-07-25.)

## How I work here (non-negotiables)

The full rulebook is **[AI-DEVELOPMENT.md](https://tjakoen.github.io/standards/ai-development)** +
**[SESSION-LOOP.md](https://tjakoen.github.io/standards/session-loop)**. The short version:

- **I build with AI, out loud, on purpose.** Co-authored with Claude as a practice, not a git
  trailer. The receipt is the README badge + footer, not commit metadata.
- **AI multiplies, it doesn't add.** The AI types; I keep the judgment, the architecture, the final
  call. If I can't explain it, I didn't build it.
- **Definition of done = code + docs synced + green gate.** For this repo the gate is `npm install`
  (it imports `@tjakoen/grain`), `node --check lib/config.mjs src/*.mjs site/*.mjs site/lib/*.mjs`,
  and a clean `npm run bake` (the theme must build from the installed grain package into
  `site/theme.css`). Not one of these, all of them.
- **Write the decision down.** Keep a short record of *why* non-obvious choices were made so the next
  session inherits the reasoning.
- **Hand off when a task finishes.** Gate green, committed, decisions recorded, then emit a compact
  handoff.

## Voice (for any prose in my name)

Follow **[VOICE.md](https://tjakoen.github.io/standards/voice)**. The short version: honest, quirky,
self-deprecating, concrete, opinionated-with-the-why; **no backticks in prose** (fenced code blocks
and this kind of reference doc are exempt, where a literal token has to be exact); **no em-dashes**;
contractions in casual writing, expanded in formal docs. Never claim a benefit I haven't shown.

## README presentation

Follow **[README-STANDARD.md](https://tjakoen.github.io/standards/readme-standard)**: one title emoji,
a curated honest badge row led by the Made with Claude badge, and the text footer. Done at repo start;
re-run the standard's prompt if the stack changes.

## Commit convention

Gitmoji subject prefix. **No AI attribution trailers** (`Co-Authored-By: Claude` etc.). The receipt
behind the "built with Claude" claim is the README badge + footer and the flagship note.

## Repo-specific rules

- **Demo mode swaps the TRANSPORT, nothing else.** `?demo=1` (or the first-run
  "Open the demo" button) makes `lib/gh.mjs` route to `lib/demo.mjs`, an in-memory
  virtual GitHub serving synthetic repos from `lib/demo-fixture.mjs`. Never add an
  if-demo branch to a view, a parser, or a builder: the whole value of demo mode is
  that everything above the transport is the production code path, so a demo that
  renders right is evidence the real one does. When a fixture and a real file shape
  disagree, the fixture is wrong (it already cost us once: pretty-printed
  `assignments.json` silently pushed every flag toggle onto config-writes' whole-file
  fallback instead of its surgical one-line diff). Demo mode must also stay
  non-persistent and non-destructive: caches bypassed, its own decisions key, the
  real Settings config never read, and the flag in sessionStorage. Keep the fixture
  in `.mjs` with invented data only - the Pages tripwire fails the build on a
  shipped `.json`/`.csv` carrying gradebook identity columns, and a real name in
  there would be a PII leak in a public artifact. `npm run test:demo` is the gate.
- **Demo shas are content-derived, like git's. Do not "simplify" them back to a
  path hash.** The fixture used to hash `org/repo@ref:path`, which is stable and
  unique and looks equivalent, but means no two repos can ever agree on anything.
  The moment a feature compares repos (the content-coverage check: is this
  workspace's `content/<unit>` the same as the teacher repo's?) the demo answers
  "everything is stale, everywhere" while the real API answers correctly. A blob's
  sha now comes from its bytes and a tree's from every descendant's relative path
  plus content, so identical folders match across repos exactly as they do on
  GitHub. `npm run test:demo` asserts both sides of it: some units current AND the
  planted drift detected, because a run that finds everything current is a broken
  comparison, not a tidy class.
- **Vendored GRAIN/CRUMB islands assume a ROOT-mounted host; the bake fixes that.**
  This app lives under a project-page subpath, so `scripts/bake-theme.mjs` rewrites
  two root-absolute assumptions in the copies it vendors: crumb-live's
  `/scripts/ai-spotlight.js` import (esbuild resolve plugin) and lightbox.js's
  `/assets/sprite.svg` (rewritten to read `data-grain-sprite`, declared on
  `site/index.html`). Both patches throw or fail loudly if the upstream shape
  changes - do not "simplify" them away, and if you add another grain island, check
  it for the same class of bug. Related: the CSP needs `font-src 'self' data:`,
  because the theme embeds its webfonts as data: URLs.
- **CRUMB tours are per-view, and the host starts them at step 0.** The tour client
  navigates by PATHNAME (`tour.route`, and any step's `at`), which is wrong for a
  hash-router SPA under a project-page subpath - it walks the visitor out of the
  app. So `app.mjs` starts a tour at its first step (no navigation at all), each
  tour only addresses `data-surface` targets that exist on the route it launches
  from, and the rail's Tour button picks the tour for the current route. Launch
  tours with `data-tour="<id>"` (the host's hook), not `data-crumb-start`.
  **All four tours declare `"route": null` on purpose, and need crumb >= 0.1.4.**
  That version made `route` nullable and added the client-side gate that skips
  navigation when the target is not an absolute pathname; before it, a missing route
  was coerced to "/" and there was no way to opt out, so Back from step 0 forced a
  navigation to `tour.route`. Do not "fix" a null route back to the Pages path: it
  looks harmless because it equals the deployed pathname, but it 404s in local dev
  and lands on the wrong site on a fork. Verified by serving `site/` from a
  throwaway subdirectory and pressing Back at step 0.

- **Sections are auto-discovered, not hardcoded.** `lib/config.mjs` scans `classes/` and derives each
  section from ground truth (folder name, git remote, `grader/assignments.json`). `grader.config.json`
  is optional overrides only. Never reintroduce absolute paths or a per-tool section array.
- **No student PII in the repo, ever.** `classes/`, `out/`, and `grader.config.json` are gitignored
  because they hold student data. Confirm nothing under those is staged before any commit.
- **GRAIN is a real dependency, not a fork.** The theme (tokens, fonts, grade mechanism) is inlined
  from `@tjakoen/grain` at build time and embedded offline (no CDN/node_modules in the generated HTML).
  Never hardcode grain's tokens back into the dashboard; change the look in grain and bump the dep.
  Provenance uses grain's `data-grade` (AI-proposed = grain type, flips to clean on human edit). See
  [docs/grain-for-ai.md](docs/grain-for-ai.md); don't collapse the two.

## Docs / structure

- `README.md` - what it is + quickstart.
- `docs/usage.md` - setup and the everyday review flow.
- `docs/commands.md` - the AI action vocabulary (the generated prompts).
- `docs/grain-for-ai.md` - how the GRAIN design system applies here.
- `src/` tools, `lib/config.mjs` the single config source. Deeper platform design lives in the
  [umbrella repo](https://github.com/tjakoen/github-native-course-platform).
