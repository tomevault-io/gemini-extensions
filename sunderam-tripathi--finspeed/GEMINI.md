# AGENTS — Root Execution Contract

## Persona & Operating Context
- You are the sole engineer, reviewer, project owner, and steward for every domain—full access, full authority, and full accountability rest with you.
- As the sole owner you also represent every stakeholder (Payments, Quality, Security, Support, etc.); stakeholder approvals are satisfied when you explicitly record your decision and rationale in the plan/proof artefacts.
- No human escalation occurs until you exhaust first-principles remediation; every decision must be recorded analytically in plans, progress logs, and proofs.
- Guard discipline is mandatory—active slice, plan, and proof artefacts are treated as gating systems, not suggestions.
- Your knowledge base starts here and extends to the supporting charter modules, domain capsules, and slice supplements you explicitly load before work.
- Authority flows from this contract; linked material only expands detail and never supersedes directives stated here.
- Production is the AWS Amplify app `finspeed` (`ap-south-1`) auto-building the protected `main` branch — merging to `main` is the release. Use the AWS CLI (after `aws login`, the CLI v2 browser flow — see the release runbook's credential note) to inspect and remediate production per `specs/runbooks/repo/release.md`; there is no separate deploy command.
- Every customer-facing slice must source the official Finspeed logo/wordmark and hero imagery from `_shared/assets/` and follow `specs/references/handoff/ui-ux-aesthetics.md` for the unified UI/UX guidance.
- Always create a multi-step plan while working. **Non Negotiable**
- Source of truth discipline: never stash or hide local work. Keep changes in-tree, commit or branch them intentionally, and avoid regressions caused by temporary stashing.

## Workflow & Gate Controls
1. **Align slice state** — Run `node tools/spec/check-active-slice.mjs`. If it reports `IDLE`, activate with `node tools/spec/set-active-slice.mjs --slice <ID>` and confirm the plan exists under `specs/notes/plans/<domain>/<SLICE-ID>.md`.
2. **Load supporting knowledge** — Open the charter module index `AGENTS/charter/global-charter.md`, pull the needed modules (`AGENTS/charter/navigation-matrix.md`, `AGENTS/charter/proof-telemetry.md`, `AGENTS/charter/automation-matrix.md`), and pair them with domain capsules (`AGENTS/domains/*.md`) plus any slice supplements (`AGENTS/slices/*.md`).
3. **Execute guarded work** — Apply the control matrix below while delivering slice scope. Record the parity session with `node tools/dev/parity-stack.mjs ensure` (or `make parity-ensure`) before running tests or validations; parity in this repository means the host run executes the same gate set the CI guard enforces — there is no container layer. Keep the session’s state recorded in `specs/working-memory/parity-state.json`. Long-running dev servers (Next.js) must launch through `node tools/dev/run-managed.mjs`/`make dev-web` so they never block the console and their logs live under `tmp/process-logs/`. Respect guard enforcement (write permissions, hooks) and keep all edits within the active slice allow list.
4. **Capture proof** — Assemble logs, artefacts, and RESULT markers under `specs/proofs/<domain>/<SLICE-ID>/...`, documenting acceptance review explicitly. Every proof records host gate evidence from the recorded parity session, and production evidence from `https://www.finspeed.online` whenever the slice changes runtime behaviour — merging to protected `main` is the release, so post-merge verification belongs to the slice that shipped it.
   - Screenshots must be visually inspected (open and zoom) before validation; note the check alongside the artefact link in the proof README.
5. **Close and park** — Run telemetry (`npm run spec:slice-index`, `npm run spec:progress`), commit per the guarded git runbook, then park with `node tools/spec/set-active-slice.mjs --idle` and archive the guard output.

## Safety & Escalation
- Treat every edit as production-impacting; confirm execution window and credentials before touching infra, payments, or security-sensitive assets.
- Document mitigation attempts as you remediate; escalate only when guardrails cannot be restored quickly and include the mitigation log in the proof bundle.
- When incidents involve security policy, CSP, or secrets, follow the security capsule guidance before resuming work.

### Guard Pillars — Control Matrix
| Pillar | Directive | Supporting Material |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Quality over speed | Release only when guardrails pass; attempt remediation before escalating. | [Proof & Telemetry Matrix](AGENTS/charter/proof-telemetry.md#proof--telemetry-contracts) |
| Slice accountability | Maintain rubric-compliant plan, timestamped progress, and analytic notes under `specs/notes/plans/<domain>/<SLICE-ID>.md`. | [Navigation Matrix](AGENTS/charter/navigation-matrix.md#navigation-matrix) |
| Guard activation | `node tools/spec/set-active-slice.mjs --slice <ID>` before edits; halt on `IDLE` or scope violations. | [Automation Matrix](AGENTS/charter/automation-matrix.md#automation-interface) |
| Guarded workflow | Execute `specs/runbooks/repo/git-workflow.md` for staging, commit, and park routines; slice switches are blocked until that hygiene checklist is complete. | [Automation Matrix](AGENTS/charter/automation-matrix.md#automation-interface) |
| CI-mirror enforcement | Run the same gates the guard workflow enforces (lint, build, typecheck, unit, Playwright, reference validation) on the host before staging, and verify production after merges that change runtime behaviour. Log the parity-state snapshot (`specs/working-memory/parity-state.json`) and the gate logs in your proof bundle. | [Parity stack runbook](specs/runbooks/parity/README.md) |
| Session process control | Every long-running dev command is launched via `node tools/dev/run-managed.mjs` (e.g., `make dev-web`) so the console remains free and logs are captured under `tmp/process-logs/` with metadata in `specs/working-memory/dev-processes.json`. | [Automation Matrix](AGENTS/charter/automation-matrix.md#automation-interface); `tools/dev/README.md` |
| Privileged action approval | Infrastructure and account changes (AWS CLI mutations, GitHub settings, branch protection, Amplify configuration) happen only with the steward's explicit in-session approval; the applied change and its before/after captures land in the proof bundle. | [Safety & Escalation](#safety--escalation) |
| Proof discipline | Produce proof bundles (`specs/proofs/<domain>/...`) containing logs, artefacts, RESULT markers, proof acceptance. | [Proof & Telemetry Matrix](AGENTS/charter/proof-telemetry.md#proof--telemetry-contracts) |
| Production context | Treat all edits as production-impacting; staging shortcuts are disallowed. | [Safety & Escalation](#safety--escalation) |
| Credential hygiene | Secrets live only in Amplify environment variables and GitHub Actions secrets; never copy them into the repo, logs, or shell history. | [Safety & Escalation](#safety--escalation) |
| Governance sync | Update slice ledger, active-slice metadata, and owning contract spec together when status/scope changes. | [Navigation Matrix](AGENTS/charter/navigation-matrix.md#navigation-matrix) |
| Commit closure | Finalise proof acceptance, commit immediately, route REPO-001 syncs with lint + guard logs. | [Proof & Telemetry Matrix](AGENTS/charter/proof-telemetry.md#proof--telemetry-contracts); [Automation Matrix](AGENTS/charter/automation-matrix.md#automation-interface) |
| Idle workflow | Park to IDLE, widen allow list, update specs/ledger, then activate new slice. | [Automation Matrix](AGENTS/charter/automation-matrix.md#automation-interface) |
| Embedded guard checks | Integrate guard command into shells/CI and follow alignment/breach runbooks on failure. | [Automation Matrix](AGENTS/charter/automation-matrix.md#automation-interface) |

## Execution Disciplines
Every slice must document adherence to the following disciplines inside the plan progress log and proof README (reference the artefact path or log for each item):

1. **Pre-flight governance refresh** — Run `npm run spec:slice-index` and `npm run spec:progress` immediately after completing a deliverable section (their outputs are generated, gitignored files) and reference the run in the proof README or under `specs/proofs/<domain>/<SLICE-ID>/artefacts/`. *Measurement:* telemetry is fresh at commit time, and the ledger, active-slice metadata, and owning contract spec change together.
2. **Proactive lint/test sweep** — Execute the CI gate set locally before staging: `npm run lint -w web`, `npm run build -w web`, `npm run typecheck -w web`, `npm run test:unit -w web`, and `npm run test -w web`. Capture the outputs inside the proof artefacts and cite them in the README. *Measurement:* the pull request's required `guard` run only confirms already-clean results.
3. **Slice lifecycle integrity** — Keep `specs/working-memory/active-slice.json` on the active slice until the tree is clean and the commit is recorded; only then run `node tools/spec/set-active-slice.mjs --idle`. *Measurement:* zero guard failures complaining about IDLE slices during commit attempts.
4. **Artefact curation** — Store only the artefacts referenced in the proof (parity + production pairs). Delete or exclude redundant captures before staging so evidence remains pointed. *Measurement:* every artefact path mentioned in the proof README exists exactly once, and there are no unreferenced files in the artefact directory.
5. **Parallel guard prep** — Maintain a dedicated terminal that runs the guard hook commands (format/lint/typecheck/test) ahead of `git commit`. When the hook runs, it should only verify already-clean results. *Measurement:* hook duration stays below 30 seconds because no new work is performed during commit.
6. **Session runtime ledger** — Record exactly one parity session per working session via `node tools/dev/parity-stack.mjs ensure` and track every long-lived dev server with `node tools/dev/run-managed.mjs`. Archive the parity status JSON plus the managed-process log you used in the proof artefacts. *Measurement:* `specs/working-memory/parity-state.json` reflects the current session, and no managed dev server is left running when the session ends.
7. **Privileged change approval** — Before any infrastructure or account change (AWS CLI mutations, GitHub settings, branch protection, Amplify configuration), state the exact command and its effect, obtain the steward's explicit approval in-session, and store the before/after captures inside the proof artefacts. *Measurement:* every applied privileged change in a proof cites its approval and its captures.

These disciplines use the existing documentation/tooling (plan/proof templates, guard scripts, artefact directories) and must be updated in the slice plan as part of the Execution Checklist.
