# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**First & Long** — a football-themed trading card game built on **Unity 6** (URP) using the **TcgEngine** template. C# only. Networking via Unity Netcode for GameObjects.

## Build & Run

This is a Unity project — there is no CLI build. Open in Unity Editor (6.x), hit Play.

- **Solution**: `My project.sln` / `Assembly-CSharp.csproj`
- **No test suite** — no unit tests exist. Test by running in Unity Editor.
- **Card import**: Unity menu `First&Long > Import Player Cards from CSV` (reads `Assets/Resources/First and Long - card_exporter.csv`)
- **Play enhancer builder**: Unity menu `First&Long > Create Play Enhancer Cards`

## Architecture

### Three Pillars

| Class | Namespace | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `GameLogicService` | `Assets.TcgEngine.Scripts.Gameplay` | Core rules engine (~2700 lines). All game rules, phase transitions, ability resolution, yardage calc |
| `GameServer` | `TcgEngine.Server` | Server-side. Receives actions, validates, runs AI. Owns `GameLogicService` |
| `GameClient` | `TcgEngine.Client` | Client singleton MonoBehaviour. Sends actions, receives state refreshes |

### Data Flow

```
Player Input -> GameClient.SendAction() -> Network -> GameServer.ReceiveAction()
    -> GameLogicService (mutates Game state) -> onRefresh Event -> Client UI update
```

### Namespace Mess (Important)

Three namespaces coexist — watch imports when creating new files:
- `TcgEngine` — data classes (CardData, AbilityData, enums), base EffectData/ConditionData, most template conditions
- `Assets.TcgEngine.Scripts.Gameplay` — runtime gameplay (Game, Player, Card, GameLogicService, HeadCoachCard)
- `Assets.TcgEngine.Scripts.Effects` — custom effects
- `Assets.TcgEngine.Scripts.Conditions` — some custom conditions (FirstPlay, PlayType, FirstSnap)
- `TcgEngine.Conditions` — other custom conditions (PlaysRemaining, DownAndDistance, GritCompare)
- `TcgEngine.Client` — all GameClient-side scripts
- `TcgEngine.Server` — GameServer
- `TcgEngine.AI` — AI players

### Ability System (Trigger -> Condition -> Effect)

Cards have `AbilityData[]` abilities. Each ability has:
- **Trigger** (`AbilityTrigger` enum): When it fires (OnPlay, OnRun, OnPass, StartOfTurn, OnLiveBallResolution=55, etc.)
- **Conditions** (`ConditionData[]`): ScriptableObject subclasses, checked via `IsTriggerConditionMet()`/`IsTargetConditionMet()`
- **Effects** (`EffectData[]`): ScriptableObject subclasses, executed via `DoEffect()` overloads
- **SlotRequirements** (`SlotRequirement[]`): slot icons needed to activate

New conditions/effects: subclass `ConditionData`/`EffectData`, create as ScriptableObject asset in `Assets/Resources/Conditions/` or `Assets/Resources/Effects/`. Register via Unity's `[CreateAssetMenu]`.

### Game Phase Loop

```
StartTurn -> ChoosePlayers -> RevealPlayers -> ChoosePlay -> RevealPlayCalls
    -> SlotSpin -> ResolvePlayOutcome -> [LiveBall if ball live] -> EndTurn
```

Phase enforcement is in `Game.CanPlayCard()`. Card types are phase-locked:
- `OffensivePlayer`/`DefensivePlayer` -> `ChoosePlayers` only
- `OffensivePlayEnhancer`/`DefensivePlayEnhancer` -> `ChoosePlay` only (max 1 per player)
- `OffLiveBall`/`DefLiveBall` -> `LiveBall` only

### Card Data

`CardData` (ScriptableObject) in `Assets/Resources/Cards/*.asset`. Key stats: `stamina`, `grit`, `run_bonus`, `short_pass_bonus`, `deep_pass_bonus`, `run_coverage_bonus`, `short_pass_coverage_bonus`, `deep_pass_coverage_bonus`, `isSuperstar`, `playerPosition`, `suit`, `slotRequirements[]`.

Runtime card state is `Card` class (in `Card.cs`), wraps `CardData` with mutable fields.

### Yardage Calculation

**Run**: `(coachBase + playerRunBase + statusBonuses) - (defCoverageBase + defBonuses)`
**Pass**: `topReceiverBase + topReceiverStatusBonus + otherOffBonuses + coachBase - defYardage`

Pass completion check reads middle reel icon from each of the 3 slot reels.

### Suit System

One card per suit per turn (player cards). `CardSuit` enum: None/Clubs/Diamonds/Hearts/Spades. Tracked in `player.suits_played_this_turn`, enforced in `CanPlayCard`.

### Slot Machine

3 reels, 8 symbols each, 512 middle-row combos. Wrench = outer reels only (bad events). Wild = center reel only.

### CSV Importer Column Layout

0=card_id, 1=Name, 2=pos, 3=Superstar?, 4=passive(text), 5=Suit, 6-8=RunBonus/ShortPass/DeepPass, 9-11=RunCov/ShortCov/DeepCov, 12=Stamina, 13=Grit. Ability slots start at col 14 (9 cols each, up to 2 slots).

## Key Files

- **Rules engine**: `Assets/TcgEngine/Scripts/Gameplay/GameLogicService.cs`
- **Game state**: `Assets/TcgEngine/Scripts/Gameplay/Game.cs`
- **Player state**: `Assets/TcgEngine/Scripts/Gameplay/Player.cs`
- **Card runtime**: `Assets/TcgEngine/Scripts/Gameplay/Card.cs`
- **Card data def**: `Assets/TcgEngine/Scripts/Data/CardData.cs`
- **Ability data def**: `Assets/TcgEngine/Scripts/Data/AbilityData.cs`
- **Slot machine**: `Assets/TcgEngine/Scripts/Gameplay/SlotMachineManager.cs`
- **Receiver ranking**: `Assets/TcgEngine/Scripts/Gameplay/ReceiverRankingSystem.cs`
- **CSV importer**: `Assets/TcgEngine/Editor/PlayerCardImporter.cs`
- **Enhancer builder**: `Assets/TcgEngine/Editor/PlayEnhancerCardBuilder.cs`
- **Project bible**: `documentation/PROJECT_BIBLE.md` (design rules, full enum reference, probabilities, edit when appropriate to correct or add)

## Conventions

- Be extremely concise in commit messages and communication. Sacrifice grammar for concision.
- At end of plans, list unresolved questions (concise, sacrifice grammar).
- ScriptableObjects must be created via `ScriptableObject.CreateInstance<T>()`, never `new`.
- Card assets are YAML ScriptableObjects in `Assets/Resources/Cards/`.
- `ResolveQueue` handles all deferred/timed callbacks — don't bypass it for sequenced game actions.

## Unity MCP Development Rules
- **MCP server**: `UnityMCP` only. Do not use `coplay-mcp`.
- **Code Verification**: After creating or modifying C# scripts, MUST call `refresh_unity` (UnityMCP) to trigger recompilation.
- **Feedback Loop**: After refresh, call `read_console` (filter errors). If errors exist, fix them and repeat until clean.
- **Scene Safety**: Use `manage_scene(get_hierarchy)` or `find_gameobjects` to verify objects exist before attaching scripts.
- **ScriptableObject Reads**: Use `manage_scriptable_object` to inspect card/ability assets rather than parsing YAML manually.
- **Menu Commands**: Use `execute_menu_item` for CSV imports (`First&Long/Import Player Cards from CSV`) and card builders.
- **Screenshots**: Use `manage_camera(screenshot)` to visually verify UI/scene changes.
- **Diagnostics First**: Before investigating code bugs, use `read_console` (with `include_stacktrace=true, format=detailed`) to get the full error + call stack. This often reveals the root cause without reading code.
- **Scene Inspection**: Use `find_gameobjects(by_component)` and `mcpforunity://scene/gameobject/{id}/components` to verify scripts are attached before assuming they work.
- **Use MCP for Unity mutations**: Prefer `manage_components`, `manage_scene(save)`, `manage_scriptable_object` over manually editing YAML assets where possible.

## Testing & Quality
- **EditMode Tests**: Use these for `GameLogicService` math. No Unity Scene required.
- **Mocking**: Use `Substitute` or manual mock classes if dependencies are too heavy.
- **Low-Hanging Fruit**: Always test `YardageCalc`, `CardEligibility`, and `Condition` logic.

## Animation Standard
- **DOTween**: Always use for UI/Transform movement. 
- **Clean up**: Always use `.SetEase(Ease.OutQuad)` (or similar) and `.SetLink(gameObject)`.
### Visuals & Animation (DOTween)
- **Engine**: DOTween (v2). Use `using DG.Tweening;`.
- **Conventions**: 
  - Prefer DOTween shortcuts (e.g., `transform.DOMove()`) over manual Lerps.
  - Set `SetLink(gameObject)` on all tweens to prevent memory leaks/errors if the object is destroyed.
  - Use `Sequence` for complex multi-step animations (e.g., Card Play -> Zoom -> Move to Slot).
  - UI animations should generally use `RectTransform.DOAnchorPos()` instead of `DOMove()`.

### Testing Strategy
- **Framework**: Unity Test Framework (NUnit).
- **Location**: All tests must reside in `Assets/TcgEngine/Tests/`.
- **Priority (Low-Hanging Fruit)**:
  1. **Logic Calculations**: Yardage formulas in `GameLogicService`.
  2. **State Checks**: `CanPlayCard()` logic (Suit enforcement, Phase locking).
  3. **Data Integrity**: ScriptableObject validation (e.g., "Do all cards have a valid ID?").
- **Constraint**: Do not write tests for UI layout or Networking latency. Focus on "Pure Logic" inside `GameLogicService` and `Game`.
