## Docs

- `docs/SKILL-STANDARD.md` — Skill conventions
- `docs/PERSONA-STANDARD.md` — Persona conventions
- `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` — Individual skill references

## Backlog And Mission Rules

- Linear team `V` / `nanika` is the canonical backlog for status, priority, and execution queue
- runtime mission files live under `~/.alluka/missions/`
- use `~/nanika/scripts/new-mission.sh <slug>` when creating a new mission
- use the `linear` CLI for routine backlog updates

### Writing Mission Files

Always use pre-decomposed PHASE lines to get deterministic execution. Without PHASE lines, the orchestrator's LLM decomposer decides the plan — and it makes mistakes (e.g., injecting code review phases into research missions, wrong dependency ordering).

Reference the decomposer skill for the full format: `.claude/skills/decomposer/SKILL.md`

Quick reference:
```
PHASE: <name> | OBJECTIVE: <concrete deliverable> | PERSONA: <persona> | SKILLS: <skill1,skill2> | DEPENDS: <phase1,phase2>
```

OBJECTIVES must name verifiable success criteria, not directives. Vague objectives are the top driver of gate-failure retries (76% of retry waste in a 7d audit — see `~/.alluka/workspaces/20260414-9ec71068/workers/data-analyst-phase-2/retry-waste-breakdown.md`). Every retry on an Opus phase wastes $3–5.

- ❌ `OBJECTIVE: Verify the implementation and close out tracker issues`
- ✅ `OBJECTIVE: Verify by (1) running <binary> and confirming the three behaviors listed in TRK-XXX, (2) closing the issue via \`tracker update TRK-XXX --status done\`. Success = tracker list shows status=done and binary output matches the expected checklist.`

Rule of thumb: if another worker couldn't tell whether the phase succeeded without re-reading the whole codebase, the objective isn't specific enough.

### Before Running

Always dry-run first:
```bash
orchestrator run <mission-file> --dry-run --verbose
```

Verify:
- No unexpected review phases on research/non-code missions (use `--no-review` if auto-injected)
- Dependencies are correct (phases that need prior output have DEPENDS)
- Persona assignments match the work type

### Research Missions

Research missions that produce no code should use `--no-review`. The auto-injected review phase assumes code output and will review the entire repo instead of the research findings.

```bash
orchestrator run <mission-file> --no-git --no-review
```

### Code Missions

Code missions benefit from the review phase. Let it auto-inject or add explicitly:
```
PHASE: implement | OBJECTIVE: ... | PERSONA: senior-backend-engineer
PHASE: review | OBJECTIVE: Review the implementation for correctness and test coverage | PERSONA: staff-code-reviewer | DEPENDS: implement
```

## Utility Scripts

### nanika-context

`~/bin/nanika-context` (source: `plugins/orchestrator/scripts/nanika-context.sh`)

Prints a system-state snapshot to stdout for manual paste into a Claude session. Runs without spawning any missions or changing state.

```bash
nanika-context              # all sections: learnings, scheduler, tracker, nen
nanika-context learnings    # recent learnings only (cold-start quality ranking)
nanika-context scheduler    # scheduler jobs + recent failures
nanika-context tracker      # open P0/P1 tracker issues
nanika-context nen          # nen-daemon stats + shu health score
```

Sections:
- **learnings** — top 15 learnings by quality score via `orchestrator hooks inject-context`
- **scheduler** — full jobs table + any FAILED entries from the last 50 history events
- **tracker** — `tracker list --status open --priority P0/P1`
- **nen** — `nen-daemon status` + `shu query status`

### orchestrator hooks preflight

Assembles a full operational brief from all registered sections and prints it to stdout. This is the **SessionStart hook** — it runs automatically at the start of every Claude session.

```bash
# Manual invocation (same as SessionStart hook)
orchestrator hooks preflight

# Specific sections only
orchestrator hooks preflight --sections learnings,tracker

# Adjust byte budget
orchestrator hooks preflight --max-bytes 12288

# Machine-readable (no truncation)
orchestrator hooks preflight --format json

# Suppress (CI / automated sessions)
NANIKA_NO_INJECT=1 orchestrator hooks preflight
```

Sections in priority order (highest first): `scheduler` → `tracker` → `learnings` → `nen` → `mission`. When the 6 KB default budget is exceeded, lowest-priority sections are dropped first.

**Manual smoke test:**
```bash
# 1. Verify output is non-empty and under 6 KB
orchestrator hooks preflight | wc -c

# 2. Confirm section headers are present
orchestrator hooks preflight | grep "^### "

# 3. Confirm opt-out works (must print 0)
NANIKA_NO_INJECT=1 orchestrator hooks preflight | wc -c

# 4. Confirm JSON round-trips
orchestrator hooks preflight --format json | jq '.blocks | length'
```

### orchestrator hooks inject-context

Prints learnings only — use inside agent worker prompts that need targeted context without the full operational brief.

```bash
orchestrator hooks inject-context --limit 15 --max-bytes 4096
```

`preflight` is the right choice for SessionStart. `inject-context` is for targeted learnings-only injection inside worker sessions.

### orchestrator dream

Mines Claude Code session transcripts for durable learnings. Walks `~/.claude/projects/` JSONL files, chunks multi-turn conversations into token-bounded windows, and extracts decisions, insights, patterns, and gotchas into the learnings DB using Haiku.

**Three dedup layers prevent flooding the DB:**
1. File-level sha256 — skip unchanged transcripts entirely
2. Chunk-level sha256 — skip re-extraction for identical conversation windows
3. Cosine similarity at 0.85 inside `learning.DB.Insert` — final semantic gate

Worker sessions (cwd inside `~/.alluka/worktrees/`) are excluded — their output is already captured live during phase execution.

```bash
# Run one extraction cycle (processes up to 20 files by default)
orchestrator dream run

# Only look at transcripts modified in the last 24 hours
orchestrator dream run --since 24h

# Filter to a specific session by path substring
orchestrator dream run --session my-project

# Reprocess everything (ignores file hash cache)
orchestrator dream run --force

# Preview what would run without calling Haiku or writing to the DB
orchestrator dream run --dry-run --verbose

# Show processed file/chunk counts
orchestrator dream status

# Clear processing state so the next run re-mines all transcripts
# (does not remove any learnings already stored)
orchestrator dream reset
```

**Relationship to the learning pipeline:**
- `orchestrator dream run` → extracts learnings → writes to `learnings.db`
- `orchestrator hooks preflight` → reads `learnings.db` → injects top learnings into every SessionStart
- `orchestrator hooks inject-context` → same DB, targeted injection inside worker sessions

Dream is the **offline consolidation path**. The live path (`CaptureWithFocus` during phase execution) captures worker session output in real time; dream catches everything else — interactive sessions, experiments, one-off scripts.


### nanika-update

`scripts/nanika-update.sh` (source: `scripts/nanika-update.sh`)

Builds, installs, restarts daemons, and verifies all plugins discovered via `plugin.json`. Runs four phases per plugin: `build → install → restart → verify`. Daemon restart is only performed for `scheduler` and `nen`.

```bash
# Build and install all plugins, restart scheduler and nen daemons, verify binaries
scripts/nanika-update.sh

# Preview what would run without executing anything
scripts/nanika-update.sh --dry-run

# Update only the discord and telegram plugins
scripts/nanika-update.sh --only discord,telegram

# Update everything except dust (slow Rust build)
scripts/nanika-update.sh --skip dust

# Machine-readable output — pipe to jq for status checks
scripts/nanika-update.sh --json | jq '[.[] | select(.status != "ok")]'

# Dry-run in JSON mode — useful for CI diff previews
scripts/nanika-update.sh --dry-run --json
```
