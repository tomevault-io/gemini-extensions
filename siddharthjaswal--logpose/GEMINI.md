Guidance for Claude Code (and any agent) working in the **LogPose** repository.

## What this is

LogPose is an open-source runtime inspector for Android. It reads an app's HTTP traffic out
of **logcat** as clean, structured, per-request transactions — fixing the interleaved lines,
mismatched bodies, and 4 KB truncation you get from ad-hoc network logging.

Since 1.5.0 it's a **framework**, not just an HTTP tool: every timeline event travels in an
`Envelope` with an opaque payload, so an app can log its own kinds (`LogPose.event { }`) and
they render without a plugin release. The same capture is exposed over **MCP**, so a coding
agent can read what the running app actually did — and create mocks to change what it receives
next.

It has **two halves that ship through two different channels** — keep them straight:

| Half | Path | What it is | Distributed via |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **IDE plugin** | repo root (`src/`) | Kotlin + IntelliJ Platform plugin: the tool window that renders transactions | **JetBrains Marketplace** (plugin id **32148**) as a built `.zip` |
| **On-device library** | `logpose-android/` | A drop-in OkHttp `Interceptor` that emits structured transactions to logcat | **JitPack** (a Gradle dependency) |
| **No-op library** | `logpose-android/no-op/` | A pure-JVM stub mirroring the interceptor's public API, for release builds | **JitPack** |

A change to plugin UX goes through the Marketplace zip; a change to capture/emit behavior
goes through the JitPack library. They version independently.

## Build & run

### IDE plugin (repo root)
```bash
./gradlew runIde         # launch a sandbox IDE with the plugin loaded
./gradlew buildPlugin    # → build/distributions/logpose-<version>.zip (Marketplace upload)
./gradlew test           # unit tests (e.g. DuplicateDetectorTest)
./gradlew verifyPlugin   # JetBrains Plugin Verifier against pinned IDEs (2024.1 → 2025.2)
```
- Version is set in `build.gradle.kts` (`version = "..."`).
- `untilBuild` is intentionally open (`provider { null }`) so the plugin loads on newer IDEs.
- The plugin talks to `adb` directly and depends on `bundledPlugin("com.intellij.modules.json")`
  for the Raw-mode editor — it deliberately does **not** depend on the Android plugin, so it
  runs in any JetBrains IDE.

### Signing & publishing the plugin
`signPlugin` / `publishPlugin` read secrets from the environment only (never the repo):
`CERTIFICATE_CHAIN`, `PRIVATE_KEY`, `PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD`, `PUBLISH_TOKEN`. Absent vars are
fine for a normal build. For a manual Marketplace upload you can upload the unsigned
`buildPlugin` zip — JetBrains signs it server-side. See `RELEASING.md`.

### On-device library (`logpose-android/`)
It's a separate Gradle build (own `settings.gradle.kts`, own wrapper). JitPack builds it via
`jitpack.yml` on each pushed git tag:
```bash
cd logpose-android && ./gradlew publishToMavenLocal -Pversion=<version>
```
This publishes two artifacts — `logpose-android` (real) and `:no-op` (stub). Current JitPack
coordinates:
```kotlin
debugImplementation("com.github.siddharthjaswal.logpose:logpose-android:<tag>")
releaseImplementation("com.github.siddharthjaswal.logpose:logpose-no-op:<tag>")
```
`okhttp` is `compileOnly` in both (the host app provides it); only the real lib pulls
`kotlinx-serialization`.

## Code map

### Plugin (`src/main/kotlin/io/github/siddharthjaswal/logpose/`)
- `toolwindow/` — `LogPosePanel` (master/detail UI), `TransactionListRenderer` (list rows),
  `LogPoseToolWindowFactory`.
- `ui/KindPresenter.kt` — maps a structured payload (db / worker / config) onto the
  title/badges/sections model a self-describing event supplies for itself, so one row layout and
  one detail view serve every non-HTTP/FCM kind. **Presentation decisions live here, never on
  the wire.**
- `ui/` — `Ui.kt` (`Theme` tokens as `JBColor` light/dark pairs, `TagLabel`, helpers),
  `OverviewPanel`, `TransactionDetailView` (HTTP), `FcmDetailView` (FCM),
  `GenericDetailView` (db / worker / config / app-defined), `JsonTreePanel` (Tree + Raw JSON
  editor),
  `FilterBar` (incl. the `NET`/`FCM`/`DB`/`WORK`/`CONF`/`APP` TYPE toggle), `CurlBuilder`,
  `MutedEndpoints`.
- `logcat/` — `LogcatReader` (tails `adb logcat`, all adb work **off the EDT**),
  `TransactionParser` (reassembles chunked JSON; returns a `LogEvent`, and routes reverse-channel
  `ControlMessage`s — hello / mock-ack — to `onControl`), `Adb` (shared adb resolve + cmd prefix).
- `mock/` — `MocksController`: owns the rule set, persists it per project, and pushes rules to
  the device via `adb shell am broadcast` (**off the EDT**); consumes hello/ack control messages
  to track sync + hit counts. Clears device rules on Stop Capture.
- `mcp/` — the MCP server exposing the live capture to coding agents. `McpTools` (query +
  mock-write logic; **free of HTTP and IntelliJ types, so it's unit-tested**), `McpSessions`
  (per-project token → capture; the token both authenticates and selects the project),
  `LogPoseMcpHandler` (hand-rolled JSON-RPC on the platform's `httpRequestHandler` EP —
  **note that EP resolves under `com.intellij`, not `org.jetbrains`, or it silently never
  loads**). Runs on a Netty IO thread: **never touch Swing there**.
- `store/` — `EventStore` (capped, arrival-ordered, id-keyed; holds `LogEvent`s of every kind).
- `analysis/` — `DuplicateDetector` (flags repeated requests; HTTP-only) and `SqlSummary`
  (operation + table from a statement). Both pure + unit-tested; SQL parsing lives **only**
  here, never in the library, so there's one implementation.
- `model/Transaction.kt` — the wire contract shared (by structure) with the library: the
  `Envelope` every timeline event travels in, `GenericEvent`/`Badge`/`Section` (self-describing
  app events), `Transaction`, `FcmMessage`, and the mock/reverse-channel types (`MockRule`,
  `MockRuleSet`, `Hello`, `MockAck`; `Transaction.mocked`). `model/LogEvent.kt` is the decoded
  form the UI works with — `Http`/`Fcm`/`Db`/`Worker`/`Config`/`Generic` over an envelope,
  exposing id, kind, timing and trace without knowing the kind. `DbQuery`/`WorkerEvent`/
  `ConfigUpdate` carry **structure, not presentation** — see `ui/KindPresenter.kt`.
- `src/main/resources/META-INF/plugin.xml` — plugin descriptor + `<change-notes>`.

### Library (`logpose-android/src/main/kotlin/io/github/siddharthjaswal/logpose/`)
- `LogPoseConfig`, `LogPoseInterceptor` — the HTTP public API.
- `LogPose.kt` — the `LogPose` object: `event { }` / `log(kind, payloadJson)` (app events) and
  `logFcmMessage` / `logFcmToken` (push). **Its public surface takes only strings and maps** —
  the no-op has no kotlinx-serialization dependency and must mirror it exactly.
- `LogPoseEvent.kt` — `EventBuilder` (badges, typed sections, `took`/`open` spans) + `Tone`.
- `LogPoseRuntimeEvents.kt` — `DbQueryInfo` / `WorkerEventInfo` holders (dependency-free, like
  `FcmMessageInfo`), fed by `LogPose.logDbQuery` / `logWorker` / `logConfigSnapshot`. Worker
  events reuse `workId` as the envelope id so a request is one updating row; config snapshots
  are diffed in the library, since Firebase reports no change list.
- `LogPoseFcm.kt` — the Firebase-free `FcmMessageInfo` holder the app fills from a
  `RemoteMessage`. LogPose references no Firebase types, so the no-op stays pure-JVM.
- `emit/` — `EventEmitter` (sink over `Envelope`, with `emit(Transaction)`/`emit(FcmMessage)`
  wrapping extensions) + `LogcatEmitter` (chunked logcat output; control messages go out bare).
- `mock/` — the device end of mock/replay: `MockRegistry` (process-wide active rules, pure +
  unit-tested), `MockCommandReceiver` (DUMP-gated broadcast receiver that ingests chunked
  rule pushes and acks), `LogPoseInitProvider`/`LogPoseRuntime` (zero-config auto-init that
  learns the package name and emits the `Hello` handshake). Registered in `AndroidManifest.xml`
  — real artifact only; the no-op ships none of it. `LogPoseInterceptor` consults
  `MockRegistry` before `chain.proceed()` and serves matches with `mocked = true`.
- `internal/BodyCapture` — body/header capture, gzip, multipart metadata, redaction.
- `wire/Wire.kt` — the `Envelope` + `GenericEvent`/`Badge`/`Section` + transaction +
  `FcmMessage` + mock/reverse-channel model (`MockRule`/`MockRuleSet`/`Hello`/`MockAck`; must
  stay in sync with the plugin's `model/Transaction.kt`).
- `no-op/` — the release stub; mirrors `LogPoseConfig`/`LogPoseInterceptor` exactly so call
  sites compile unchanged when swapping `debugImplementation` → `releaseImplementation`.

## Conventions

- **Commits:** author as **Sid / Siddharth Jaswal**, **no `Co-Authored-By` trailers**.
- **Don't commit** unless asked. Never commit secrets or signing keys (`*.pem`, `chain.crt`
  are gitignored).
- **Wire compatibility:** the plugin's `model/Transaction.kt` and the library's `wire/Wire.kt`
  describe the same JSON. Change them together, and treat the format as still pre-1.0.
- **No-op swap:** `logpose-android` and `logpose-no-op` share FQCNs on purpose (so call sites
  compile unchanged), so they must never land on one classpath together — consumers use a
  `debugImplementation(real)` / `releaseImplementation(no-op)` split applied the **same way in
  every module**, and address the two module coordinates directly, never a repo aggregator. Mixing
  a plain `implementation` of the real artifact into a release that also pulls the no-op is the
  duplicate-class trap. Keep the no-op a byte-for-byte API mirror of the real public surface.
- **EDT discipline:** never block the EDT on `adb`/process I/O in the plugin — that caused an
  IDE-freeze bug; all reader/process work runs on background threads.
- **Theme:** use `Theme.*` tokens (`JBColor` light/dark pairs), never hard-coded colors, so
  the UI adapts to the active IDE theme.
- Keep `CHANGELOG.md` and `plugin.xml` `<change-notes>` updated when shipping plugin changes.
