# Agent Instructions

- If behavior, CLI output/options, or configuration changes, update the relevant docs in `docs/` in the same change.
  Do not update `docs/` for minor changes.
- When asked to make a PR, first rebase your changes on latest `main`, then open a PR. Verify that the PR
  body is formatted correctly, then monitor CI and push fixes for any CI failures or merge conflicts.

## Changelog

- Any change with a user-visible effect must include an entry in `docs/changelog.md`.
- Add changelog entries under `## Unreleased` in `docs/changelog.md`.
- Changelog entries should be single bullets in plain language that explain the user-visible effect (not internal refactors).
- Bugfixes for bugs that were not in any release do not need changelog entries.

## Architecture

- Major files include:
  - `name_check_visitor.py` contains the core visitor that walks over code being type checked. It should visit
    every AST node exactly twice (in the collect and check phases). This file should
    contain the core checker logic, but delegate to other files (e.g., `attributes.py`,
    `type_object.py`, `stacked_scopes.py`) for narrower logic specific to those files.
  - `value.py` contains the core data structures representing types.
  - `relations.py` performs basic operations on types, such as subtyping, assignability, and intersections.
  - `type_object.py` contains rich data about classes.
  - `annotations.py` contains code for understanding annotations and typing-related objects and parsing them into pycroscope's internal
    data structures.
  - `arg_spec.py` parses callable objects and extracts their callable signatures.
  - `signature.py` contains representations of callable signatures and operations on them, such as type checking calls.
  - `checker.py` orchestrates type checking across multiple files and maintains caches that span across files.
  - `implementation.py` contains callbacks ("impls") that perform more precise checks or type inference on specific callables.
  - `stacked_scopes.py` contains logic for tracking which names are in scope and for local narrowing.
  - `attributes.py` retrieves attributes on objects.
- Techniques for keeping `name_check_visitor.py` clean include:
  - Collect short-lived data in attributes on the `NameCheckVisitor`, then aggregate it later. For example, to determine whether
    a function is a generator, set some marker when visiting `yield` expressions, and read the result at the end of visiting the
    `FunctionDef`. To handle nesting, stash any existing state when entering a new `FunctionDef`.
  - Make canonical internal representations (such as `Value` and `TypeObject` objects) rich enough to store the state you need;
    avoid creating additional complex objects internal to `name_check_visitor.py`.

## Testing

- Before finishing, run the linting/tests relevant to the files you changed.
- `test_self.py` is often useful for finding regressions. Run it with the `full` extra enabled or it will be skipped.
- Run conformance CI with the same interpreter you want pycroscope itself to use, because `tools/conformance_ci.py`
  invokes `sys.executable -m pycroscope` under the hood.
- Use this form from the repo root: `uv run --python 3.12 python tools/conformance_ci.py --typing-repo ~/py/typing`
  (optionally prefix `UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/uv-cache`).
- When fixing regressions found by `test_self.py`, add separate test cases instead of just relying on `test_self.py`.
- When writing test cases, always use code samples (`@assert_passes()`) instead of tests that directly
  invoke pycroscope functions. Code samples should represent user-written code that triggers the pycroscope
  feature under test and should not import internal pycroscope functions (except where needed for e.g. `assert_is_value`).
  Use direct unit tests (calling internal functions) only if testing a widely used API with a clear contract, such as `TypeObject.get_attribute` or `has_relation`.
- Prefer `assert_type()` over `assert_is_value()` for type assertions against types where possible; it's OK to keep
  `assert_is_value` for more complicated types that cannot be directly represented in user code.

## Coverage

- To reproduce the CI coverage run locally, use Python 3.14 and `pytest-cov`, for example:
  `UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/uv-cache uv run --python 3.14 --extra tests --extra asynq --extra codemod --with pytest-cov pytest --cov=pycroscope --cov-report=term-missing --cov-report=json:coverage.json pycroscope`
- To generate an HTML line-by-line coverage report locally, add `--cov-report=html` to the coverage command above.
  The report is written to `htmlcov/index.html`.
- The pinned-full-coverage check is checked in as `tools/check_full_coverage.py`; run it with
  `python tools/check_full_coverage.py coverage.json tools/full_coverage_files.txt`.

## Code Conventions

- Types and type signatures should have a single canonical internal representation,
  which is normalized when we parse annotations (e.g. in `annotations.py`). We should use
  the same representation regardless of whether an object was created in importable or
  unimportable mode.
- All type inference should go through the main type inference visitor in `name_check_visitor.py`. Other code should
  generally not perform AST walks. (Exceptions include the pattern matching visitor in `patma.py`, stub visitor in
  `typeshed.py`, and annotation visitor in `annotations.py`.) Always prefer using Values
  derived from type inference over doing direct checks on the AST.
- The code should avoid special-casing specific functions or standard library classes outside of impl functions in
  `implementation.py`. Instead of special-casing individual symbols, find more general solutions.
- `implementation.py` should contain only impl functions used by extended argspecs. Shared non-impl helpers should
  live in the owning module even when they support special-casing logic.
- Code that branches on different subclasses of `Value` should take care to cover all cases. Where possible, replace
  code that dispatches on different kinds of values with a call to a general helper function that already knows how
  to deal with all Values, such as `has_relation`, `is_assignable`, or `is_subtype`. If dispatching on `Value` is
  necessary, use the following procedure:
  - Call `pycroscope.value.gradualize` or `pycroscope.value.replace_fallback` to narrow the Value to a
    fixed set of classes. This will raise `NotAGradualType`
    when it encounters unexpected Value subclasses. Do not catch this exception; instead add specific handling for those
    classes. Non-GradualType Value subclasses should be used only in narrow places.
    `replace_fallback` narrows to a smaller set of Value subclasses (`BasicType` instead of `GradualType`). If you need special handling for some types that are GradualType but not BasicType, do that here.
  - Perform special handing for `MultiValuedValue` (unions) and `IntersectionValue` (intersections), usually calling the
    same logic for each member value and aggregating the results.
  - Now dispatch over all remaining types, which are described by the `SimpleType` union. Use `assert_never()` to ensure
    all types are covered.
- Avoid using `@staticmethod` for local helper functions. Use private module-level functions instead.
- Avoid using function-local imports, except where necessary to avoid an import cycle.
- Never catch `NotAGradualType`. Instead refactor the code so that non-gradual types do not escape narrow parts of the
  checker, or add specific handling for individual types.
- Do not use the names of symbols or parameters (such as `self`) for logic. Instead use type inference or figure out
  whether a parameter (for example) logically represents `self` without relying on the name.
  Exception: opinionated lint-style checks may still enforce spelling conventions for parameter names, such as
  `method_first_arg` requiring `self`/`cls`.
- The behavior in import failure mode (where we cannot load the runtime module) should match that in normal mode
  as much as possible. As a corollary, whenever testing import failure-related issues,
  write tests with `run_in_both_module_modes=True` if possible; avoid `allow_import_failures=True`.
- Types and other internal objects should only be represented in one canonical way in pycroscope's internal logic.
  There should not be two equivalent ways to represent the same concept.
