# AI PM Workspace

This is the operating system for an AI-powered product management workspace. Claude Code reads this file at the start of every session so it knows who you are, how your vault is organized, and how to behave.

## How tasks live in this repo

Tasks live in [Dashboard/tasks.md](Dashboard/tasks.md) - a plain-markdown checklist with three sections:

- **This week** - what you've committed to.
- **Next** - intended soon, not this week.
- **Backlog** - unscheduled.

Skills write to `Dashboard/tasks.md` by default (no external task manager required). Each task line looks like:

```
- [ ] Action description - source: [[note title]] - due: YYYY-MM-DD - priority: P3
```

Priority, due date, and source are all optional.

**Optional Todoist sync**: If you prefer Todoist, follow `docs/todoist-sync.md` to wire it up. The default template works without it.

---

## MCP Servers Available

<!-- MCPs are configured via `claude mcp add`, not stored in this file. -->
<!-- See setup/mcp-configs/ for setup instructions for each MCP server. -->

### GitHub MCP (recommended)
**Use for**: Repository and issue management.
**Key operations**:
- Check implementation status on epics
- Read engineering comments on issues
- Find related PRs

### [Optional] Documentation MCP
<!-- If your company has a docs MCP (e.g., for public API docs), configure it and note it here. -->

### [Optional] Notion / Linear / Jira
<!-- If you use these tools, configure the respective MCP and note it here. /personalize --deep will help detect what you have. -->

**Priority levels**: P1 (critical) down to P5 (optional).
**Status markers** (added during Friday review):
- `✅` done
- `🔄` carried over
- `❌` not done / deprioritized

P-Tasks go into `Dashboard/Weekly P-Tasks.md`. Their subtasks and standalone tasks go into `Dashboard/tasks.md` under "This week".

### Tags
- `DailyNote` - daily journal entries
- `LooseNotes` - general notes
- `MeetingNotes` - meeting records
- `Initiative` - initiative working files
- `Epic` - epic drafts
- `Persona` - persona files in `research/personas/`
- `Journey` - user journey artifacts
- `Research` / `Competitive` - competitive and user research notes
<!-- Add your own tags: people tags (#PersonName), customer tags (#CustomerName), etc. -->

## Task Cadence

| Frequency | Tasks | Skills to use |
|-----------|-------|---------------|
| **Daily** | Morning planning, evening close-out, meeting notes, decisions, communications | `/today`, `/meeting`, `/decision`, `/communicate` |
| **Weekly** | P-Tasks planning, triage of `Dashboard/tasks.md` | `/weekly-plan` |
| **Monthly** | Reflection, progress review | Custom agent (build your own) |

---

## People & Communication Context

**Reference**: `Dashboard/people-profiles.md` for communication preferences and working styles.

<!-- PERSONALIZE: adjust to match your organization. -->

**Communication tone guidance**:
- **Engineering teams**: technical, specific, actionable (include links to specs, APIs, issues).
- **Design teams**: user-focused, visual references, customer context.
- **Leadership**: strategic, metrics-driven, concise, aligned with company goals.
- **Customers**: professional, benefits-focused, clear ROI, no internal jargon.

**Slack markdown formatting**:
- Bold: `*text*` (single asterisk), NOT `**text**`
- Bullets: `-` for bullets
- Emoji: `:emoji_name:` format

---

## Interaction Rules

### Task-writing confirm-before-executing
- **Never write to `Dashboard/tasks.md` without showing the user the proposed list first.**
- Always present proposed new tasks as a numbered list so the user can respond with "1,3,5" for partial approval.
- Check for duplicate tasks (all three sections) before proposing new ones.

### Formatting
- **Never use the em-dash character (Unicode U+2014).** Always use a regular hyphen (`-`).
- **Slack**: single-asterisk bold (`*bold*`), `-` bullets, `:emoji_name:` format.
- **File references in chat output**: always wrap vault paths in backticks, e.g. `` `Meetings/2026-04-15 - Quarterly sync.md` ``. Do NOT use markdown links like `[text](path with spaces)` - spaces in the URL break the link in Claude Code. Do NOT use `[[wikilinks]]` in chat output either - those only render in Obsidian. Wikilinks are still correct *inside* vault files (Related sections, `source:` fields).
- **Skill chat output tone**: when a skill reports its results to chat, write prose, not a fenced template card with `✅ / 📋 / 📝 / 💡` headers. Code fences are for content that's literally meant to be copied verbatim (e.g. a Slack message draft, an email body). The summary around that content should read like a person, not a form.

### Style
- Lead with the action or answer, not the reasoning.
- Don't summarize what you just did at the end of every response - the user can see the file diff.
- Batch questions when possible; avoid constant confirmation prompts.

---

## Privacy Rules

1. **Never reference this vault** in shared repositories or documents.
2. **Never commit vault content** to other repos.
3. **Never expose personal content** in work outputs.

---

## Quality standards for notes and artifacts

Adapted from shared PM quality practices. Apply to anything Claude generates in this vault.

### Every note
- **Lead with the result or recommendation**, not background.
- **Name the stakeholder / owner** of any follow-up action.
- **Cite sources** - wikilink related notes, link to external docs or issues.
- **Keep paragraphs short** - bullets over prose when it helps skimming.

### Decisions
- State the decision in one line at the top.
- List the 2-3 options considered with pros/cons, even if the chosen option is obvious.
- Record who was involved and what the blockers were.
- Always include a "Follow-up" section with concrete tasks (these become entries in `Dashboard/tasks.md`).

### Meeting notes
- Attendees tagged with `#FirstName`.
- Explicit "Decisions" and "Action Items" sections - not buried in prose.
- Action items have an owner and a deadline when mentioned.
- Tasks assigned to the owner of this vault (you) go into `Dashboard/tasks.md`; tasks assigned to others stay in the meeting note only.

### Communications
- Match tone to audience (see the table above).
- Under 200 words for Slack messages.
- Email: clear subject line, inverted-pyramid body.
- Never use internal jargon with customers.

## How AI Should Work with This Vault

### Do
- Analyze journals for **patterns across days**, not individual entries.
- Be specific and direct - reference concrete notes and patterns.
- Follow existing naming conventions when creating notes.
- Link new notes in today's journal (`journals/YYYY/MM-Month/DD-MM-YYYY.md`) under `## Notes`.
- Write work notes in `Loose Notes/Work/`.
- Write new tasks to `Dashboard/tasks.md` under "This week" after user confirmation.

### Don't
- Don't give generic productivity advice - be specific to documented patterns.
- Don't create files outside the established folder structure.
- Don't assume empty daily note fields mean a bad day.
- Don't write to external repositories from this vault.
- Don't use em-dashes.
- Don't write tasks without confirming them with the user first.

---

## Daily Notes Structure

Daily notes follow the template in `templates/daily-note.md`:

- **Yesterday**: what happened, energy tracking
- **Today**: mood, self-care, focus (max 3 items), link to `Dashboard/tasks.md`
- **Notes**: links to meeting notes and loose notes created that day
- **End of Day**: what was completed, what to start with tomorrow

**Frontmatter**: includes `energy` and `mood` fields for quantitative tracking.

---

## Important Patterns

### Overplanning tendency
**Pattern**: Most PMs plan too many tasks for the week, leading to disappointment when not all are completed.
**Solution**: When running `/weekly-plan`, if the list has more than 5-7 P-tasks or last week's completion rate was low, challenge and ask to prioritize. Remind: "Which 3-5 tasks are truly critical?"

### Meeting note enrichment
**Pattern**: Raw meeting notes need structure, context links, and action items extracted.
**Solution**: `/meeting` creates structured notes with decisions, action items (added to `Dashboard/tasks.md` after confirmation), and links to related context.

### Decision documentation
**Pattern**: Decisions happen in Slack or meetings but aren't always documented.
**Solution**: `/decision` creates structured decision notes, links them in the daily journal, and proposes follow-up tasks.
