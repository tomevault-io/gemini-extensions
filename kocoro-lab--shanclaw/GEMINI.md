## What This Is

Go CLI tool (`shan`) — the runtime for Shannon AI agents. The primary production stack is **daemon + ShanClaw Desktop + Shannon Cloud**: the daemon connects to Cloud via WebSocket, receives channel messages, runs the agent loop locally with full tool access, and streams results back. ShanClaw also supports interactive TUI, one-shot CLI, MCP server mode, and local scheduled tasks.

## Tech Stack

- **Go 1.25.7** — `go.mod` is source of truth
- **Cobra** — CLI framework
- **gorilla/websocket** — daemon WebSocket client (primary production path)
- **Bubbletea v1.3.10 + Bubbles v1.0.0** — TUI
- **modernc.org/sqlite** — pure-Go SQLite for session FTS5 search index
- **adhocore/gronx** — cron expression validation
- **chromedp** — browser automation (isolated Chrome profile)
- **mcp-go** — MCP client/server
- **adrg/frontmatter** — YAML frontmatter parsing for SKILL.md files

## Key Conventions

### Kocoro Skill Co-Maintenance
The `kocoro` bundled skill (`internal/skills/bundled/skills/kocoro/`) is a platform configuration assistant. Its SKILL.md and reference files (`references/*.md`) describe daemon API endpoints, config fields, and workflows. When daemon APIs, config schema, permission model, or safety gates change, update the corresponding kocoro reference file in the same PR. See CLAUDE.md for the full mapping.

### Agent Names

Must match `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9_-]{0,63}$`. Validate before any path concatenation to prevent traversal.

### Tool Priority

Local tools > MCP tools > Gateway tools. Deduplicate by name in the registry.

### Skill Discovery

Three-layer system for triggering `use_skill`:
1. **Skill listing** — full descriptions embedded in the scaffolded user message on first turn.
2. **Semantic discovery** — blocking `model_tier: "small"` call on iteration 0 (5s timeout). Gated by `agent.skill_discovery` config (default `true`).
3. **Fallback catalog** — `use_skill` tool description includes all loaded skill names.

**Skill allowed-tools** uses execution-time denial, not schema filtering, to keep the tools array byte-stable for prompt cache.

### Permission Model

```
hard-block constants → denied_commands → compound-command splitting → allowed_commands → default safe → RequiresApproval + SafeChecker
```

Unknown tools are denied by default.

### Daemon Architecture

- Daemon connects to Shannon Cloud via WebSocket, receives channel messages, and runs the agent loop locally.
- Route keys are computed as:
  - `agent:<name>` for agent-scoped sessions
  - `session:<id>` for explicit session resume
  - `default:<source>:<channel>` for routed channel sessions
- Routed managers are long-lived. Ephemeral runs (for example bypass/heartbeat paths) use short-lived managers.
- Output formatting uses profiles, not per-channel syntax:
  - `markdown` is the default
  - `plain` is used for cloud-distributed channels where Shannon Cloud owns final rendering
- Tool status `running` is emitted at actual execution start, not during approval/permission checks.
- Large tool results spill to `~/.shannon/tmp/` and are cleaned up:
  - per-run in daemon and TUI
  - on manager close in one-shot mode
- **Session sync** (`internal/sync/`): uploads local session JSON to Shannon Cloud once per day (opt-in via `sync.enabled`). Single entry point `sync.Run`; called from the daemon ticker and the `shan sessions sync` CLI; flock + atomic marker write serialize concurrent callers. Per-session ACK with persistent `marker.failed` bookkeeping; permanent reasons (`size_limit_exceeded`, `load_error`) stay forever and self-heal on session edit.
- **Memory client** (`internal/memory/`, Phase 2.3): daemon owns sidecar lifecycle (spawn / health / restart / shutdown) and the 24h bundle pull loop. Tool `memory_recall` (`internal/tools/memory.go`) delegates to `memory.Service.Query` via UDS; falls back to `session_search` + MEMORY.md whenever `Service.Status() != Ready`. CLI/TUI use `memory.AttachPolicy` (probe-only, never spawn) and connect via `memory.NewServiceAttached`. Privacy invariant: the resolved API key bytes never reach disk or audit logs (only `sha256[:16]` fingerprint in `<bundle_root>/.tenant_fingerprint`).

### Turn Lifecycle

The agent loop declares an explicit phase state machine (`internal/agent/phase.go`) that external observers can reason about:

- **Phases**: `PhaseAwaitingLLM`, `PhaseExecutingTools`, `PhaseCompacting`, `PhaseAwaitingApproval`, `PhaseRetryingLLM`, `PhaseForceStop`, `PhaseInjectingMessage`, etc. Only `PhaseAwaitingLLM` and `PhaseForceStop` count as idle for the watchdog.
- **Idle watchdog**: with `agent.idle_soft_timeout_secs` > 0 the daemon fires an `EventRunStatus` event (code `idle_soft`) after that long in an idle-counted phase. With `agent.idle_hard_timeout_secs` > 0 the run is cancelled with `ErrHardIdleTimeout` — the partial transcript is still persisted (soft error). Defaults: soft=90, hard=0 (visibility-only).
- **Mid-turn checkpoint**: after each tool batch, after successful reactive compaction, and before a force-stop, the daemon rebuilds the on-disk session from a baseline + current loop snapshot. The same rebuild runs at final save so a turn is never persisted twice. `session.Session.InProgress=true` on reload indicates a crash-recovered session with a partial transcript.
- **Event types**: `EventRunStatus` (watchdog soft/hard, LLM retries) joins the existing `EventAgentReply`, `EventToolStatus`, `EventApprovalRequest` stream.

### Browser Preview Bridge

For daemon runs with Playwright, `browser_navigate(file://…)` is transparently rewritten to a short-lived `http://127.0.0.1/<token>/<name>` URL served by a loopback HTTP server bound per-session:
- Fail-closed allowlist populated from the effective session CWD + user-attached paths. Browser reach never exceeds `permissions.CheckFilePath`.
- Symlinks resolved on both sides of the allowlist check; escapes rejected.
- Random 16-byte hex token per file; no directory listing; teardown on session close.

### Config Merge Order

1. `~/.shannon/config.yaml` (global)
2. `.shannon/config.yaml` (project)
3. `.shannon/config.local.yaml` (local, gitignored)

Scalars override, lists merge+dedup, structs merge field-by-field. MCP server env var casing is preserved via direct YAML re-read.

### File Paths

- Agent definitions: `~/.shannon/agents/<name>/AGENT.md`, `MEMORY.md`, `config.yaml`, `commands/*.md`, `_attached.yaml`
- Global skills: `~/.shannon/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`
- Sessions: `~/.shannon/sessions/` or `~/.shannon/agents/<name>/sessions/`
- Session index: `<sessions-dir>/sessions.db`
- Spill files: `~/.shannon/tmp/tool_result_<session>_<call_id>.txt`
- Schedule index: `~/.shannon/schedules.json`
- Schedule plists: `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.shannon.schedule.<id>.plist`
- Sync marker: `~/.shannon/sync_marker.json`
- Sync lock (flock): `~/.shannon/sync.lock` (never delete)
- Sync dry-run outbox: `~/.shannon/sync_outbox/` (only when `sync.dry_run=true`)
- Audit log: `~/.shannon/logs/audit.log`
- Schedule logs: `~/.shannon/logs/schedule-<id>.log`
- Memory sidecar socket: `~/.shannon/memory.sock`
- Memory bundle root: `~/.shannon/memory/` (with `bundles/<ts>/`, `current` symlink, `.tenant_fingerprint`, `bundle.lock`)

### Prompt Cache

Source-routed TTL: channels/TUI get 1h, one-shot/subagent paths get 5m (fail-cheap default). `cache_source` tags every LLM call and propagates on the wire. `normalizeToolInput` canonicalizes nested JSON for byte stability. See `docs/cache-strategy.md` for breakpoint layout, source table, env-var overrides, and maintenance playbook.

### Context Management

- **Proactive compaction**: persist learnings, then generate a two-phase summary, then shape history when nearing the context window.
- **Reactive compaction**: on context-length error, emergency compact once and retry once. `reactiveCompacted` prevents loops.
- **Tiered result compression**:
  - Tier 1: old results collapse to metadata only
  - Tier 2: mid-age results use head+tail truncation, with micro-compact for large native tool results when a small-model completer is available
  - Tier 3: recent results stay full
- **Deferred tool loading**: when the toolset is large and includes deferred sources, MCP/gateway tools are exposed as summaries until the model loads schemas through `tool_search`.
- **Memory staleness**: dated memory headings get freshness annotations like `[today]` and `[N days ago]`.
- **System reminders**: short reminder blocks are appended to high-signal tool results (`file_read`, `file_write`, `file_edit`, `bash`) to reinforce key instructions in long sessions.
- **Disk spill**: very large tool outputs are written to disk and replaced in context with a short preview plus a readable path.

### Anti-Hallucination

- XML `<tool_exec>` delimiters use random hex call IDs.
- Preamble text is suppressed when the response contains tool calls.
- Fabricated tool calls are detected and stripped.

## Testing

```bash
go test ./...                    # all tests
go test ./internal/agent/ -v     # agent loop, batching, compaction, spill, deferred
go test ./internal/daemon/ -v    # daemon WS client, router, runner
go test ./internal/agents/ -v    # agent loader
go test ./internal/schedule/ -v  # schedule CRUD + plist tests
go test ./test/ -v               # E2E coverage
go test ./test/e2e/ -v           # E2E offline: agents, schedule, session, MCP, cache
SHANNON_E2E_LIVE=1 go test ./test/e2e/ -v  # E2E live: one-shot, bundled agents (daemon skipped until isolated)
go build ./...                   # build check
```

Schedule tests use temp directories and never write to the real LaunchAgents directory.

E2E tests in `test/e2e/` split into offline (no API) and live (`SHANNON_E2E_LIVE=1`). Run live tests before releases.

## Building & Releasing

- GoReleaser: `.goreleaser.yaml`
- npm package: `@kocoro/shanclaw`
- Versioning is PATCH-only (`0.0.x`) unless explicitly directed otherwise
- Release flow: tag → push tag → CI builds and publishes
- `docs/` is gitignored — documentation lives locally only
