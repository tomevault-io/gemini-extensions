# GitHub Copilot Agents for Layer5 Academy

This document provides guidance for GitHub Copilot agents and Large Language
Models (LLMs) contributing to the Layer5 Academy content repository at
<https://github.com/layer5io/layer5-academy>. These guidelines ensure
consistency, quality, and alignment with the project's educational mission.

## Repository Overview

**Layer5 Academy** is the **official content repository** for Layer5's learning
platform, hosting all official learning paths, challenges, and certifications.
It serves as the primary source of educational content for engineers learning
about cloud native infrastructure, service meshes, Kubernetes, and related
technologies.

**Key Characteristics:**

- **Role**: Content repository for Layer5 Academy learning platform
- **Primary Technology**: Hugo static site generator (extended version 0.146.0+)
- **Content Focus**: Educational materials including learning paths,
  challenges, certifications, and hands-on labs
- **Integration**: Works in combination with:
  - [academy-theme](https://github.com/layer5io/academy-theme) - provides
    layouts, styles, and components
  - [academy-build](https://github.com/layer5io/academy-build) - central build
    and deployment pipeline
  - [academy-example](https://github.com/layer5io/academy-example) - starter
    template for organizations

**Technology Stack:**

- Hugo (extended version 0.146.0 or later)
- Go modules (for theme management)
- Node.js & npm (for build tools)
- Markdown/MDX for content
- PostCSS for styling

## Development Environment

### Prerequisites

- **Go** (version 1.24.5 or later) - Required for Hugo modules
- **Hugo Extended** (version 0.146.0 or later) - Core static site generator

## Development Guidelines for Agents

### Making Content Changes

1. **Explore First**: Review existing content to understand structure and
   style
2. **Follow Patterns**: Maintain consistency with existing learning paths and
   challenges
3. **Test Locally**: Always preview changes using `make site` before
   committing
4. **Small Changes**: Make focused, minimal modifications
5. **Proper Structure**: Ensure content follows Hugo's directory structure
6. **Frontmatter Validation**: Verify all required frontmatter fields are
   present

### Content Modification Workflow

```bash
# 1. Navigate to content directory
cd content/

# 2. Create or edit content files
vi learning-paths/service-mesh-fundamentals/_index.md

# 3. Start local development server to preview
make site

# 4. Verify changes at http://localhost:1313/academy

# 5. Fix any linting issues
make lint-fix

# 6. Commit changes with descriptive message
git commit -s -m "docs: add service mesh fundamentals learning path"
```

### Asset Management

- **Images**: Place in `/static/images/` with descriptive names
- **Documents**: Place in `/static/assets/` for downloadable content
- **Videos**: Host externally (YouTube, Vimeo) and embed using Hugo shortcodes
- **File Naming**: Use lowercase with hyphens (e.g., `service-mesh-diagram.png`)
- **Size Optimization**: Compress images and assets before committing

### Hugo Shortcodes

The academy-theme provides custom shortcodes for enhanced content. Reference
the [academy-theme documentation](https://github.com/layer5io/academy-theme)
for available shortcodes.

## Integration with Related Repositories

### Academy Theme

The academy-theme is included as a Go module and provides:

- Layout templates and partials
- Styling and design system components
- Custom Hugo shortcodes
- Interactive elements

**Local Development with Theme:**

When developing both the content and theme simultaneously:

```go
// In go.mod, add a replace directive:
replace github.com/layer5io/academy-theme => ../academy-theme
```

### Academy Build

The academy-build pipeline:

- Aggregates content from multiple repositories
- Applies the academy-theme
- Generates the complete Academy site
- Deploys to Layer5 Cloud

**Publishing**: Merged changes to the `master` branch are automatically
integrated into the central academy-build pipeline and deployed to the Academy
platform.

### Academy Example

Use [academy-example](https://github.com/layer5io/academy-example) as a
reference for:

- Creating organization-specific content repositories
- Following Academy content standards
