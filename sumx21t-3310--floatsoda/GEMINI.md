# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to coding agents — Codex, Claude Code (claude.ai/code), and others — when working with code in this repository.

> **This file is the single source of project instructions for every agent.** Codex and other AGENTS.md-aware tools read it directly; Claude Code reads it through a one-line `@AGENTS.md` import in `CLAUDE.md`. Put project instructions here, never in `CLAUDE.md` — anything added there is invisible to every other agent.

## Working Style

The repository owner develops hands-on and tracks the implementation themselves. By default, **investigate and explain — do not modify code.** When asked about a bug or behavior, report the root cause, the relevant files/lines, and (optionally) how a fix would look, but leave the actual implementation to the owner unless they explicitly ask you to make the change.

## Output Language

**Write all output to the repository owner in Japanese.** This is a hard requirement, not a preference.

- **Code review** — findings, severity reasoning, and suggested fixes are written in Japanese, even though the code and identifiers under review are English.
- **Investigation reports** — root cause, affected files/lines, and how a fix would look.
- **Commit messages and PR titles/bodies.**

Do not translate identifiers, type names, file paths, or code fences — those stay verbatim as they appear in the source.

Rationale: FloatSoda treats **Japanese as the neutral (default) language** — see `docs/Localization.md`. `docs/`, XML doc comments, and exception messages are all Japanese by design. Review output in Japanese keeps the entire surface consistent for the owner and for the LLMs that relay it to end users. If you feel English "should" be the default here, read `docs/Localization.md` before changing anything.

## Project Overview

FloatSoda is a SteamVR Overlay UI framework for .NET 10 / C# 14 that brings Flutter-like declarative UI to VR overlays. It renders via SkiaSharp → OpenGL (GLFW/OpenTK) → OpenVR overlay texture.

## Target Users

FloatSoda targets three personas. Use them as the yardstick for API design, docs tone, and error messages:

1. **VRChatters who vibe-code personal tools** — they barely write code themselves; an LLM does. The real "reader" of `docs/` and the API surface is the LLM, so optimize for "an LLM cannot misuse this API." Concrete wants: a FaceEmo expression switcher (OSC), a VRChat photo album, a friend-online toast notifier.
2. **Booth creators selling overlays** — Unity-native programmers capable of building a game world, but they only know uGUI and have never seen declarative UI. Explain concepts by mapping from Unity/Udon vocabulary. They can handle exe distribution given a guide.
3. **Engineers who avoid uGUI** — their core pain is that uGUI is not text-based (scenes/prefabs don't diff, review, or LLM-generate). The headline value: **the entire UI lives in C# code — no scenes, no prefabs**. Never introduce state that can't be expressed in code (e.g. external asset/config files) without weighing this trade-off.

## Build & Run Commands

```bash
# Run the sample overlay app
dotnet run --project samples/FloatSoda.Samples.OverlayApp

# Build the whole solution
dotnet build

# Run all tests
dotnet test

# Run a specific test project
dotnet test tests/FloatSoda.Test
dotnet test tests/FloatSoda.Rendering.Test

# Run a specific test by name
dotnet test tests/FloatSoda.Test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~AlignmentTest.ComputeOffset"
```

Tests use xunit. `FloatSoda.Test` tests geometry types, RenderObjects, and Widgets. `FloatSoda.Rendering.Test` tests the Layer tree.

### Test naming

Test method names follow **`MemberName_条件_期待結果`**: the leading member name stays English, the condition and expected result are written in **Japanese**. Test class names stay English (they mirror the type under test).

```csharp
[Fact]
public void ComputeOffset_親子が同サイズ_原点を返す() { ... }

[Fact]
public void BorderSide_Widthが負_ArgumentOutOfRangeExceptionを投げる() { ... }
```

Do not use `[Fact(DisplayName = "…")]` — it duplicates the intent and drifts. Do not bulk-rename existing tests; apply this to new tests only. Full rules: `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

### UI Layering Rules (see `docs/UILayering.md`)

The UI is split into three layers: `FloatSoda` (core + primitive widgets; anything touching Skia/render-tree types), `FloatSoda.UI` (headless behavior: interaction state machines, typed builder slots), and two parallel design systems `FloatSoda.UI.Cream` / `FloatSoda.UI.FizzyPop` (state→visual mapping only). **Only the core layer ships today** — the upper two are skeletons planned for Phase 5, marked `IsPackable=false`, and `ButtonBase` is not yet wired to `GestureDetector`. The rules below still bind: they decide where new code goes when that work lands. Two rules: (1) behavior/state machines always go in `FloatSoda.UI`, never in a design system; (2) `FloatSoda.UI` widgets must work without any design-system `InheritedWidget` (themes' `Of()` returns null and components fall back to defaults). Litmus test: each design system must be buildable without copying code from the other. Design systems never reference each other.

## Architecture: Three Trees

FloatSoda mirrors Flutter's three-tree model. The RenderObject and Layer trees are fully implemented; the Widget/Element tree has incremental (dirty-list) rebuilds working for `StatelessWidget`, `StatefulWidget`, and `InheritedWidget`, including keyed multi-child list diffing:

### 1. RenderObject Tree (`src/FloatSoda/RenderObjects/`)

The low-level layout-and-paint tree with incremental updates. Property changes call `MarkNeedsLayout()` / `MarkNeedsPaint()`, which propagate to the nearest relayout/repaint boundary and register that node on `RenderPipeline.NodesNeedingLayout` / `NodesNeedingPaint`. Each frame:
1. `RenderPipeline.FlushLayout()` → processes dirty nodes in `Depth` order via `LayoutWithoutResize()`
2. `RenderPipeline.FlushPaint()` → repaints dirty nodes via `PaintingContext.RepaintCompositedChild()`, recording Skia draw calls into `PictureLayer`s inside a `ContainerLayer` tree

`RenderView.PrepareInitialFrame()` seeds both lists for the first frame. Frames with no dirty nodes skip layout/paint entirely.

Key classes:
- `RenderObject` — abstract base; subclasses implement `PerformLayout()` + `Paint(PaintingContext, Offset)`; `Layout(BoxConstraints)` is the non-virtual entry point that handles relayout boundaries
- `RenderBox` — adds `SKSize Size`; most layout objects extend this
- `RenderProxyBox` — single-child passthrough base (delegates layout/paint to child)
- `SingleChildContainer<T>` / `MultiChildrenCollection<T>` — composition helpers for child holding (adopt/drop on assignment, attach/detach/visit forwarding)
- `RenderImage` — renders an `SKImage` loaded via `FileImageProvider`

### 2. Layer Tree (`src/FloatSoda.Rendering/Layers/`)

Produced by the RenderObject tree's paint phase. Represents composited draw operations sent to the render thread:
- `ContainerLayer` — node with child layers
- `PictureLayer` — leaf holding an `SKPicture` (recorded Skia commands)
- `ClipRectLayer`, `ClipRoundRectLayer`, `ClipPathLayer`, `OpacityLayer`, `TransformLayer` — compositing effects

The layer tree is **cloned** (`ILayer.Clone()`) before being handed to the render thread to avoid data races.

### 3. Widget/Element Tree (`src/FloatSoda/Widgets/`, `src/FloatSoda/Elements/`) — Core implemented

Flutter-style declarative layer built on top of the RenderObject tree. `StatelessWidget` / `StatefulWidget` / `InheritedWidget` / `ParentDataWidget<T>` and their elements are all wired, including incremental rebuilds via `BuildOwner` and keyed two-ended list diffing in `MultiChildRenderObjectElement`. Layout, painting, and input widgets have all landed — `Padding`, `Container`, `Stack`, `Wrap`, `Expanded`, `AspectRatio`, `Opacity`, `Transform`, `GestureDetector`, `Listener`, and the rest are `public` and working. Remaining gaps: scrolling widgets (`ListView`, `GridView`, `SingleChildScrollView`) and `Components.Icon` / `Components.Image` are still `internal` stubs; `Container` does not yet compose `Padding`; and pointer coordinates only reach dashboard overlays, so `GestureDetector` callbacks never fire on `WorldSpaceWindow` / `DeviceTrackedWindow` (`Button`/`Icon` now live in the design-system layer; see UI Layering Rules above):
- `Widget` — immutable `abstract record`; declares `CreateElement()` and holds an optional `Key`. `Widget.CanUpdate` is Flutter-style (same runtime type + equal `Key`); a fast-path record-equality check in `Element.UpdateChild` short-circuits identical widgets before that
- `RenderObjectWidget<T>` — widget that owns a `RenderObject`; declares `CreateRenderObject()` / `UpdateRenderObject(T)`
- `StatelessWidget` — `Build()` is called by `StatelessElement`; usable today
- `StatefulWidget<T>` / `State<T>` — state lifecycle wired via `StatefulElement`; `State.SetState()` mutates state and calls `Element.MarkNeedsBuild()` to schedule a rebuild
- `InheritedWidget` / `InheritedElement` — context propagation with dependent tracking; descendants registered via `DependOnInheritedWidget` are notified on change
- `Element` — mutable tree node; `Mount()` / `UpdateChild()` / `InflateWidget()` / `MarkNeedsBuild()` / `Rebuild()`
- `BuildOwner` — per-window rebuild scheduler; holds the dirty-element list, `BuildScope()` rebuilds dirty elements in `Depth` order (parents first)
- `RenderObjectElement` — element that attaches its `RenderObject` into the render tree; `UpdateChildren()` implements the keyed two-ended list-diff for multi-child widgets
- `RenderObjectToWidgetAdapter` — bridges the widget tree root to a `RenderView`; `AttachToRenderTree(owner, element)` mounts on first call and schedules a rebuild (via `NewWidget` + `MarkNeedsBuild`) on re-attach
- `WidgetBinding` — per-window coordinator; owns the `BuildOwner`; `DrawFrame()` runs `BuildOwner.BuildScope()` then flushes layout/paint only when `NeedsVisualUpdate` is set
- `src/FloatSoda.Hooks` — R3-based `HookWidget` / `HookElement` (`UseState` via `ReactiveProperty`), partially implemented, not yet integrated with the build loop; the `HookExtension` helpers (`UseState`/`UseEffect`/`UseMemo`/etc.) still throw `NotImplementedException`

## Frame Pipeline

```
FloatSodaApp.Run() [main thread, STA]
  └─ PollEvents()          — VREvent_Quit etc.
  └─ DrawFrame()           — per WidgetBinding (window)
       └─ BuildOwner.BuildScope()        — rebuild dirty Elements → UpdateRenderObject
       └─ (skip rest unless NeedsVisualUpdate)
       └─ RenderPipeline.FlushLayout()   — layout dirty RenderObjects (Depth order)
       └─ RenderPipeline.FlushPaint()    — repaint dirty RenderObjects → Layer tree
       └─ RenderThreadRunner.PostRender(layer.Clone())
            └─ [render thread] OverlayWindow.Update()
                 └─ Renderer.Render(layer)
                      └─ GLView.Clear() → layer.Layout(ctx) → layer.Paint(ctx) → GLView.Flush()
                 └─ OpenVR SetRenderTexture(GL texture handle)
  └─ FramePacer.WaitForNextFrame()
```

The render thread runs in `RenderThreadRunner` (a `ThreadRunner` subclass) and owns the GLFW/GL context. Work is posted via `ConcurrentQueue<Action>` (`_pendingTasks`). Window creation is also deferred through this queue so all GL calls stay on the same thread.

## API Design Conventions (from `docs/APIDesign.md`)

- **Object-initializer first**: no constructor arguments on components — use `init` properties only.
- **Single child** → `Child` property; **multiple children** → `Children` (`IList<Widget>`).
- **Geometry types** → `readonly record struct` (e.g. `Offset`, `Size`, `Rect`, `EdgeInsets`, `BoxConstraints`).
- **Context/theme objects** → `record` (reference type, supports `with`-expression propagation).
- **Static factory methods** follow the naming table: `All(v)`, `Symmetric(h,v)`, `Only(...)`, `Zero`/`Empty`, `FromXxx(...)`.
- All `public` properties get XML doc comments (`/// <summary>…</summary>`).
- Properties use `init` accessors to enforce immutability; use `required` for mandatory fields.
- Event handlers are typed `Action?` / `Action<T>?` / `Func<Task>?` with an `On` prefix (e.g. `OnClick`, `OnChanged`).
- Style attributes live in a separate `*Style` record (e.g. `ButtonStyle`), not on the component itself.
