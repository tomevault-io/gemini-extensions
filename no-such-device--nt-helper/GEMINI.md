# nt_helper - Disting NT MIDI Helper

Flutter app for Disting NT Eurorack module: preset management, algorithm loading, parameter control via MIDI SysEx.

**Platforms:** Linux, macOS, iOS, Android, Windows
**Modes:** Demo (no hardware), Offline (cached), Connected (live MIDI)

## Architecture

- **State:** Cubit pattern with delegate decomposition (`lib/cubit/disting_cubit.dart`)
- **MIDI:** Interface-based with mock/offline/live implementations (`lib/domain/i_disting_midi_manager.dart`)
- **Database:** Drift ORM (`lib/db/database.dart`)
- **MCP:** Model Context Protocol server (`lib/services/mcp_server_service.dart`)

### DistingCubit Delegates

The main cubit is decomposed into delegates and mixins for maintainability.

**Rule of thumb**: keep `lib/cubit/disting_cubit.dart` as an orchestration/facade layer. Add new non-trivial behavior in a delegate or an existing ops mixin.

| File | Type | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| `*_connection_delegate.dart` | Delegate | MIDI device connection |
| `*_parameter_fetch_delegate.dart` | Delegate | Parameter loading with retry |
| `*_parameter_refresh_delegate.dart` | Delegate | Live parameter polling |
| `*_parameter_value_delegate.dart` | Delegate | Parameter value writes + verification |
| `*_parameter_string_delegate.dart` | Delegate | Parameter value-string reads/writes |
| `*_mapping_delegate.dart` | Delegate | CV/MIDI/i2c/performance mappings |
| `*_slot_state_delegate.dart` | Delegate | Slot state updates + routing refresh |
| `*_slot_maintenance_delegate.dart` | Delegate | Slot repair/refresh/reset helpers |
| `*_state_refresh_delegate.dart` | Delegate | Refresh state from MIDI manager |
| `*_state_helpers_delegate.dart` | Delegate | Routing + offline metadata helpers |
| `*_algorithm_library_delegate.dart` | Delegate | Algorithm library refresh/rescan |
| `*_plugin_delegate.dart` | Delegate | Plugin installation |
| `*_sd_card_delegate.dart` | Delegate | SD card preset listing/scanning |
| `*_lua_reload_delegate.dart` | Delegate | Lua reload with state preservation |
| `*_offline_demo_delegate.dart` | Delegate | Demo/offline mode |
| `*_hardware_commands_delegate.dart` | Delegate | Screenshot/display/reboot/remount |
| `*_monitoring_delegate.dart` | Delegate | CPU monitoring + USB video |
| `*_refresh_delegate.dart` | Delegate | Refresh/cancelSync orchestration |
| `*_algorithm_ops.dart` | Mixin | Algorithm operations |
| `*_preset_ops.dart` | Mixin | Preset operations |
| `*_slot_ops.dart` | Mixin | Slot operations |

All use `part of 'disting_cubit.dart'` for private access. See `docs/architecture/coding-standards.md` for pattern details and guardrails.

## Routing System

OO framework in `lib/core/routing/` for data-driven routing visualization.

- `AlgorithmRouting.fromSlot()` creates routing from live Slot data
- `ConnectionDiscoveryService` discovers connections via bus assignments (1-12 inputs, 13-20 outputs)
- `RoutingEditorCubit` orchestrates state; `RoutingEditorWidget` displays only
- ES-5 algorithms (clck, eucp, clkm, clkd, pycv) support direct output routing via `Es5DirectOutputAlgorithmRouting`

## Graphify Codebase Graph

`nt_helper` is indexed in Substrate's registered `graphify-mcp` graph. Invoke
the `graphify` skill for graph search, architecture discovery, relationship
tracing, ownership/adjacency checks, or PR impact work. The skill is the source
of truth for live service discovery and tool routing.

Route every Graphify service lookup and tool call through `mcp__substrate`.
Use the `graphify-mcp__*` tools mapped by Substrate, or
`mcp__substrate.invoke_tool` when the compatibility wrapper is required. Never
connect to or invoke a standalone Graphify MCP server directly.

Use Graphify to find existing behavior before introducing a new helper,
delegate, service, or parallel implementation.

1. Start with the smallest useful query: `query_graph` for orientation,
   `get_node`/`get_neighbors` for a specific symbol, and `shortest_path` for a
   relationship between concepts.
2. For architecture or impact work, inspect the relevant communities rather
   than stopping at Community 0, which is only the largest cluster.
3. Treat Graphify as a map, not source truth. Confirm important findings with
   `rg` and the actual files in this checkout before editing.

Follow the skill's Substrate-registered service workflow rather than using
generic knowledge search, an external Graphify install, or a local graph
rebuild. Prefer plain `rg` for a simple exact text/file lookup. Use PR-impact
tools only for PR/merge work, and corroborate current GitHub status separately.

## Commands

```
flutter analyze          # Must pass with zero warnings
flutter test             # Run before commits
flutter run -d macos --print-dtd   # Run with DTD URL for MCP connection
```

## Updating Flutter (fvm)

```
fvm releases                     # List versions; find latest stable at the bottom
fvm install <VERSION>            # e.g. fvm install 3.41.6
fvm global <VERSION>             # Set as global default
```

## Worktrees

Generated files (mocks, freezed, drift) are gitignored. After `git worktree add`, run:

```
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

before `flutter analyze` or `flutter test`.

## Release

Use the `nt-helper-release` skill and the existing
`.github/workflows/tag-build.yml` workflow. A tag or release page is not the
finish line: every required distribution job and public asset must be verified.

Use the `thorinside` GitHub CLI credential for this repository. Before release
checks or GitHub API operations, run `gh auth switch -u thorinside`; do not use
the `nealsanche` credential.

Before creating a tag:

1. Confirm `main` is clean and synchronized with `origin/main`.
2. Run `flutter analyze` and the full `flutter test` suite on the exact commit
   being released.
3. Start and verify the self-hosted Windows runner as described below. Do not
   push the tag while that runner is offline.
4. Choose `patch` for fixes/maintenance, `minor` for any user-visible feature,
   and `major` only for an intentional breaking release.
5. Run `./version <patch|minor|major>`, inspect the generated version commit and
   exact `vX.Y.Z` tag, then push `main` followed by that exact tag. Do not use a
   broad `git push --tags`.

Monitor the tag-triggered release with:

```bash
bash /Users/nealsanche/.codex/skills/nt-helper-release/scripts/wait-for-release.sh \
  vX.Y.Z
```

A release is complete only when these seven jobs succeed: Android APK, Android
AAB/Play upload, Windows, Linux, macOS, macOS/TestFlight, and iOS. The public,
non-draft GitHub release must contain five non-empty assets: APK, Linux ZIP,
macOS ZIP, Windows ZIP, and Windows installer. Download and inspect any affected
package when the release changes packaging, signing, native libraries, or the
installer. Finish with a clean worktree whose `HEAD` matches `origin/main`.

### Windows self-hosted release runner

For SSH, direct Windows commands, and desktop access, see
[dev-Windows runner access](docs/dev-windows-runner-access.md).

The Windows job targets `[self-hosted, Windows, X64]`. It runs in the VirtualBox
VM named `nt-helper-windows-x64` on
`neal@dev.allosaurus-newton.ts.net`, registered with GitHub as `dev-Windows`.
The VM and its 100 GB dynamically allocated disk live under
`/mnt/LINDATA/nt-helper-windows-runner` on that host.

Before tagging, check the VM state and start it headlessly when necessary:

```bash
ssh neal@dev.allosaurus-newton.ts.net \
  'VBoxManage showvminfo "nt-helper-windows-x64" --machinereadable | grep "^VMState="'
ssh neal@dev.allosaurus-newton.ts.net \
  'VBoxManage startvm "nt-helper-windows-x64" --type headless'
```

Wait for GitHub to report the runner online and idle:

```bash
gh api orgs/No-Such-Device/actions/runners \
  --jq '.runners[] | select(.name=="dev-Windows") | {name,status,busy}'
```

Starting the VM is sufficient: Windows starts the
`actions.runner.No-Such-Device.dev-Windows` service automatically and it
reconnects to GitHub. Do not switch the job back to GitHub-hosted Windows as a
fallback when hosted minutes are unavailable; fix a missing runner prerequisite
instead.

The guest is Windows 11 Home x64 with 8 virtual CPUs, 16 GB RAM, VirtualBox
Guest Additions, and Windows Developer Mode. Keep the Flutter action's
`architecture: x64` and the existing x64 build/output paths. These guest
prerequisites are already provisioned and are part of the runner contract:

- Visual Studio Build Tools at `C:\BuildTools`, including
  `Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.VCTools` and
  `Microsoft.VisualStudio.Component.VC.ATL` (`atlbase.h` is required by the USB
  video plugin).
- Windows Developer Mode enabled machine-wide so Flutter plugins can create
  symlinks.
- Machine-wide PowerShell 7 at
  `C:\Program Files\PowerShell\7\pwsh.exe`.
- Git Bash at `C:\Program Files\Git\bin\bash.exe`.
- `jq.exe` at `C:\ProgramData\nt-helper-runner\bin\jq.exe`.
- Machine-wide Inno Setup 6 at
  `C:\Program Files (x86)\Inno Setup 6\ISCC.exe`.
- Git and GitHub CLI available to the runner service.

The workflow's `Add runner tools to PATH` and `Verify Inno Setup` steps are
intentional portability checks; do not replace them with assumptions inherited
from GitHub-hosted images. If a Windows build fails, inspect the exact failed
step, repair the persistent guest prerequisite, and rerun the failed job. Do not
move/delete the release tag or create another version merely to retry it.

The VM may remain running as the persistent nt_helper runner. If it must be
stopped to reclaim host resources, first confirm the runner is not busy and no
Windows job is queued, then request a graceful guest shutdown:

```bash
ssh neal@dev.allosaurus-newton.ts.net \
  'VBoxManage controlvm "nt-helper-windows-x64" acpipowerbutton'
```

## Flutter Accessibility

- Build Flutter UI so blind users can understand state, navigate controls, and complete workflows with a screen reader.
- Provide semantic labels for icon-only controls, custom widgets, progress indicators, and non-text affordances.
- Mark page, dialog, section, and group titles with `Semantics(header: true)` when they structure navigation.
- Use `Semantics(liveRegion: true)` and `SemanticsService.sendAnnouncement` for meaningful async state changes, validation errors, empty states, selection changes, and completion of non-visual operations.
- Wrap decorative or duplicated visual-only content in `ExcludeSemantics` so screen readers do not announce noise.
- Preserve keyboard and focus traversal for dialogs, lists, toggles, segmented controls, file import/export flows, and drag/drop alternatives.
- Add or update widget semantics tests for new interactive UI, especially icon-only actions, live status text, selected states, and error paths.

## Commits

- Use Conventional Commit-style subjects so changelog and semver tooling can classify changes.
- Prefer types such as `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `refactor:`, `perf:`, `build:`, `ci:`, `chore:`, and `revert:`.
- Use an optional scope when it adds clarity, for example `feat(template-manager): add JSON import`.
- Mark breaking changes with `!` in the subject or a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer.
- Keep the subject imperative and focused on the user-visible or release-relevant change.

## Rules

- Zero tolerance for `flutter analyze` errors
- Never add debug logging unless explicitly asked
- Do not restart the app if already running — disrupts MCP/debugger connections
- SysEx messages must be at most 1024 bytes. SD-card file upload (`7A 04`)
  must use 512-byte file data chunks. SD-card file download (`7A 02`) is
  canonical whole-file only; do not invent offset/count chunked download
  requests. Verify large WAV uploads by directory listing names/sizes or a
  mounted SD-card filesystem, not whole-file SysEx download.
- Prefer snackbars for exceptions, failures, or invalid actions; avoid success snackbars unless explicitly requested.
