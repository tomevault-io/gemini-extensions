# Agent notes — jevify

Instructions for coding agents (Claude, Codex, Grok, Cursor, and others)
working in this repository. These rules are **mandatory** unless the user
explicitly overrides them for a task.

This file governs **how** work is done here. **What** the project is lives in
[`docs/00-invariants.md`](docs/00-invariants.md): purpose, vocabulary, the
numbered invariants, the design criteria and the score-semantics contract.
That document ranks above every ADR and above this file. Read it before
changing anything. Decisions that constrain future work are ADRs under
`docs/adr/`, indexed in [`docs/adr/README.md`](docs/adr/README.md).

Four principles bind every change, restated here for a project that started
empty: Always Works, test-driven development, SOLID, and one authoritative
path per process.

## A. Always Works™ — proof before done

**"Should work" ≠ "does work."** Before marking any change complete, prove
it with evidence you personally observed in this session, not with
assumptions, not with "the build succeeded", and not with a result from an
earlier state of the tree.

| Change type | Minimum proof |
|---|---|
| Code | The test suite runs green against the **working tree**, in the interpreter and dependency set the project pins. |
| Anything that runs, serves, loads or scores | Run it and observe its output. A passing unit test is not a running program. |
| A number in a document | Comes from a run whose command, inputs and their hashes, model revisions and software versions are recorded next to it. Re-derive; do not copy from memory. |
| Docs only | No runtime required; still re-read for accuracy against the tree. |
| Config, CI, scripts | Execute the path that changed. |

**The stale-artifact trap.** Anything cached is evidence about the past:
a built image, a downloaded checkpoint, a feature cache, a saved run, a
result file. Before a cached thing counts as proof, show that it
corresponds to the working tree (rebuild it, or compare a recorded hash or
revision). A green result on a stale artifact is a silent false green.

**Name what is unproven.** When done, state plainly which paths were
exercised and which were not. A claim of completion that hides an untested
path is a defect in the claim, not in the code.

## B. Test-driven development — new behavior is test-first

Do not write production code for a new feature, a bug fix with a known
reproduction, or a new module until a failing test names the behavior.

| Rule | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Red → green → refactor** | Write one failing test; write the minimum code that passes; only then improve structure. |
| **Vertical slices** | One seam, one behavior at a time. Do not bulk-write a suite of imagined tests and then implement everything. |
| **Agree the seam first** | Before the first test, state the public interface under test: a function, a Protocol, an HTTP path, a CLI command. Tests hit that seam only. |
| **No private tests** | Do not assert on private helpers, internal call counts or implementation structure. Prefer fakes at port seams. |
| **Independent expected values** | Assertions use known literals or domain rules, never a recomputation of the algorithm under test. |
| **Where tests live** | `tests/`, runnable from a clean checkout with one documented command. |
| **When TDD does not apply** | Pure renames, docs, configuration, mechanical refactors with no behavior change. Existing tests still run (principle A). |

Measured results are tests too. An experiment has a protocol written and
hashed **before** the run, a fixed evaluation set, and no post-hoc tuning
against the test split. A result that was selected on the test set is not
a result.

## C. SOLID — deep modules behind narrow seams

Prefer **deep modules** (small interface, large behavior) over shallow
pass-through wrappers. Vocabulary for structure: *module, interface,
implementation, depth, seam, adapter, port, composition root.*

| Principle | In this repository |
|---|---|
| **S** — Single responsibility | One reason to change per module. A module that mixes core logic with a vendor client, a model runtime or a transport has two. |
| **O** — Open/closed | Extend by adding an adapter or a new caller of a deep module. Do not fork a spine and edit the copy. |
| **L** — Liskov | Every adapter of a port is substitutable, including test fakes. A fake that honors less of the Protocol than production is a lying test. |
| **I** — Interface segregation | Focused Protocols. No object that callers use ten percent of. |
| **D** — Dependency inversion | Core logic depends on **ports** (Protocols), never on concrete adapters, model libraries, HTTP clients or files. One composition root wires adapters into the core; nothing else constructs infrastructure. |

**The deletion test.** If deleting a module only moves lines around and no
complexity concentrates anywhere, it was shallow. Do not add more of those.

Anti-patterns to reject on sight:

- Implementing first and "adding tests later".
- Core logic typed against a concrete runtime, client or store instead of a port.
- A blanket `except Exception` that swallows a failure without logging it and naming its contract.
- Weakening an invariant in production code to make a test pass.
- Drive-by changes: reformatting unrelated files, wide renames without need, scope beyond the task.
- Docs drift: changing a public seam without updating the document that describes it in the same change.

## D. Honor all chokepoints — one authoritative path per singular process

Guarantees held by discipline (comments, naming conventions, hand-mirrored
copies) drift, and the second copy of a process is the one written without
the guards.

**A singular process has exactly one implementation.** Anything that looks
like a second implementation must be one of:

- a **call** into the one authoritative function or module (the chokepoint);
- a **derived view** computed from the one authoritative registry, never a hand-maintained parallel table;
- a **pinned mirror**, where a copy is physically unavoidable (another language, another runtime, a serialized payload): a test loads both sides from one fixture or compares them field by field, so drift turns red.

Corollaries, each load-bearing:

1. **Guards travel with the chokepoint, not the caller.** A rule such as "validate before scoring" or "wrap transport exceptions" lives inside the shared function so the next caller inherits it by construction.
2. **Registries over string literals.** When control flow branches on a family of magic strings, the family gets one registry carrying the strings and their attributes; consumers derive. Wire and record formats are frozen by canary tests; a registry refactors ownership, never compatibility.
3. **Enforcement is a ratchet test, not a review habit.** A chokepoint ships with a structure guard (an AST scan, an import ban, a fixture comparison) whose failure message names the chokepoint to use. Guards are anti-accident, not anti-adversary, and say so.
4. **Comments that say "keep in sync with X" are defects.** Replace each with a call, a derivation or a pinned mirror, or document why the sync cannot be structural, dated, with the guard that watches it.

**In a new project the first implementation is the chokepoint.** Create it
deliberately the moment a process gets its second caller, not after its
fourth copy. The review question, answerable mechanically: *which
chokepoint does this go through?* If none fits, the change either creates
one or documents why the process is genuinely plural.

## House rules

- **Secrets** never enter files, logs, tests or chat. Credentials on this host come from the operator's secret store; pipe them into the consumer, never into the tree.
- **Local state** stays out of git: downloaded weights, caches, run outputs, generated data. `.gitignore` is the chokepoint for that rule; extend it, do not work around it.
- **One intent per commit and per PR.** Small, reviewable diffs.
- **Decisions are recorded.** A choice that constrains future work becomes an ADR under `docs/adr/`, indexed in `docs/adr/README.md`, whose status column is the ledger. Superseding an ADR updates both its row and its header.
- **Honest claims.** No document, README line, scorecard or API response claims more than the recorded evidence shows. The claims contract is `docs/00-invariants.md` §5; copy that exceeds it is a defect on the same footing as a failing test.
- **Vocabulary.** Use the terms defined in `docs/00-invariants.md` §2 and no synonyms: state, question, answer, semantics label, readout, adapter, port, probe, recipe, warm, evaluate, suite, scorecard, backend.
