# AI Code Style Rules for this repository

NOTE: The canonical source for these instructions is .cursorrules in the repo root.
Any changes should be made there; this file syncs automatically via pre-commit hook.

# Style & Formatting
- Use Black/Ruff exactly as configured in pyproject.toml (line length 100, Python 3.14).
- Follow PEP 8 principles; Black/Ruff are authoritative for enforcement.
- Optimize for clarity and readability; prefer explicit types where helpful.
- Prefer `X | None` in type annotations; prefer union syntax in `isinstance()` checks (e.g., `int | str`) over tuples.
- Type Annotations:
  - Always add type hints to function/method parameters and return types
  - Use modern Python 3.10+ syntax: `X | None` instead of `Optional[X]`
  - In tests, annotate fixtures: `hass: HomeAssistant`, `caplog: pytest.LogCaptureFixture`
  - Add return types even for simple functions: `-> None`, `-> str`, `-> dict[str, Any]`

# Imports
- Organize imports consistent with Ruff isort settings.
  - known-first-party: ["custom_components"]
  - Do not force single-line imports.
  - Group order: standard library, third-party, first-party.
- Import ABCs (Callable, Iterable, etc.) from collections.abc, not typing.
- Use X | None instead of Optional[X] (modern Python 3.10+ syntax).

# Linting
- Enable Ruff rules: [E, F, I, B, UP] as configured in pyproject.toml.
- Respect per-file ignores from pyproject:
  - tests/**/*.py: [E501, F401, I001]

# License Headers
- All Python and YAML files MUST include the repository-standard license header at the top:
  - SPDX identifier and full Apache-2.0 header block used in this repo.
  - Python: hash-prefixed lines (e.g., `# SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0`, followed by the Apache block lines).
  - YAML: hash-prefixed lines at the top of the file.
  - Markdown: use an HTML comment block with the same content (recommended for docs like tests/README.md).
- Markdown files must use the lowercase `.md` extension (e.g., `README.md`).
- JSON does not support comments; do not attempt to add headers there.
- Tests are code; apply headers to test files (Python) as well.
- When creating or editing files, ensure the header is present and matches the canonical format already used in the repo.

# Comments
- Keep comments concise and only when adding non-obvious context.
- Explain complex logic, non-obvious patterns, or HA-specific requirements.
- Document type: ignore comments with justification for why they're needed.

# Home Assistant Specifics
- Only support HA 2026.3 and newer, no need for backward compatibility to older versions
- Use HA async patterns (`async_*` methods); avoid blocking I/O in the event loop.
  - Use hass.async_add_executor_job for any blocking operations.
- Prefer CoordinatorEntity for entities with push updates.
  - For push-based entities, set update_interval=None and push via coordinator.async_set_updated_data.
  - Use optimistic updates for user commands and reconcile on push ack to avoid UI snap-back.
- Multi-device model: coordinator data is dict[device_id, dict[str, int | str]], one entity per
  device; entity unique_id must use self._device_id consistently.
- Optimistic overlays: apply per-key overlays immediately; guard ~8s; confirm then clear;
  revert only on explicit failure.
- Runtime Data (Modern Pattern - HA 2026.2+):
  - Use ConfigEntry.runtime_data with TypedDict (not hass.data)
  - Define type alias for better IDE support and type checking:
    ```python
    class FanSyncRuntimeData(TypedDict):
        client: FanSyncClient
        coordinator: FanSyncCoordinator
    
    type FanSyncConfigEntry = ConfigEntry[FanSyncRuntimeData]
    
    async def async_setup_entry(hass, entry: FanSyncConfigEntry) -> bool:
        client = entry.runtime_data.client  # Full IDE autocomplete ✅
    ```
  - Pass config_entry to DataUpdateCoordinator.__init__ (recommended pattern)
- Entity Performance:
  - Set `should_poll = False` when using coordinator (inherited from CoordinatorEntity)
  - Use `__slots__` for memory efficiency in high-entity-count scenarios (optional)

# Testing
- Always add new tests, ensure they pass, and requisite code coverage is met when adding new functionality.
- Use pytest; do not make real network calls. Patch httpx and async websockets at module paths:
  - HTTP: Patch `httpx.Client` at `custom_components.fansync.client.*`
  - WebSocket: Patch `websockets.connect` at `custom_components.fansync.client.websockets.connect` with `new_callable=AsyncMock`
- Coverage focus in CI is custom_components/fansync; target ≥ 75%.
- Include tests for: push callback merge, reconnect paths, config flow (happy/error/duplicate),
  optimistic overlay expiry, and multi-device entity isolation.
- Test debug logging with caplog to verify messages format correctly.
- Ensure tests clean up background async tasks (call async_disconnect on FanSyncClient).
  - This cancels the `_recv_task` (async WebSocket receiver) and closes connections.
- Use Home Assistant's config flow test helpers (hass.config_entries.flow.async_init) instead of
  directly instantiating flow classes.
- Type annotations in tests:
  - Always annotate test function parameters: `hass: HomeAssistant`, `caplog: pytest.LogCaptureFixture`
  - Always add return type `-> None` to async test functions
  - Import HomeAssistant from homeassistant.core
  - Import pytest for LogCaptureFixture type hint
- Testing Best Practices (from HA core guidelines):
  - **Never access hass.data directly** - Use entry.runtime_data in tests
  - **Use snapshot testing** - For verifying entity states across refactors (syrupy)
  - **Test through integration setup** - Don't instantiate entities directly
  - **Mock external APIs** - Patch at module import paths where classes are used
  - **Use init_integration fixture** - Standard pattern for setup in tests
  - **Verify registries** - Ensure entities properly registered with devices

# Git / Commits
- Commit message subject MUST be ≤ 72 characters (to avoid GitHub truncation).
- Use Conventional Commits for PR titles and squash-merge subjects (required):
  - Allowed types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, build, ci, chore, revert
  - Scope is optional; subject in imperative mood
  - Examples: "feat: add optimistic light updates", "fix: prevent UI snap-back"
- Commit message body:
  - Include detailed summary of changes for non-trivial commits
  - Structure multi-part changes with section headings (e.g., "Client:", "Testing:")
  - Explain the "why" and "what", not just the "how"
  - Mention coverage changes, test additions, breaking changes
  - Wrap body lines at ~72 characters
  - For multi-line bodies, prefer a here-doc to stdin with `-F -`, or a file
    with `-F <file>`. Do NOT rely on multiple `-m` flags; ensure a blank line
    between subject and body to preserve formatting. Example:
    ```bash
    git commit --amend -F - <<'EOF'
    feat: add optimistic updates

    - Apply overlay immediately and guard for 8s
    - Reconcile on push ack; revert only on explicit failure
    EOF
    ```
- PR titles must be semantic; a workflow enforces this.

# Debug Logging
- Use DEBUG level for diagnostic information (state changes, timings, reconnects)
- Use INFO for significant events (connection established, device discovered)
- Use WARNING for recoverable errors (retries, fallbacks)
- Use ERROR for failures requiring user attention
- Always guard debug logs with `if _LOGGER.isEnabledFor(logging.DEBUG):` for expensive operations
- Include relevant context: device_id, keys affected, timing info, error types
- Test debug logging paths to ensure messages format correctly

# Error Handling
- Narrow exception catches to specific types (e.g., ValueError, TypeError instead of Exception)
- Use builtin `TimeoutError` (not `asyncio.TimeoutError`) per Python 3.11+ and Ruff UP041
  - `asyncio.TimeoutError` is an alias to builtin `TimeoutError` in Python 3.11+
  - Always use `except TimeoutError:` to catch timeouts from `asyncio.wait_for()`
- PEP 758 (Python 3.14): bare-comma `except` is valid — `except TypeError, ValueError:` is preferred by Black over `except (TypeError, ValueError):`
- Log exceptions with type and message at appropriate level before re-raising or returning error state
- Use RuntimeError for integration-specific errors (connection failures, invalid state)
- Use `ConfigEntryNotReady` for transient setup failures so HA retries with backoff
- In config flow, catch and map exceptions to user-friendly error keys
- Ensure cleanup (async_disconnect) happens in finally blocks or error paths
- For retries, use exponential backoff and log retry attempts at DEBUG level
- Keep try blocks minimal - only wrap the fallible operation:
  - ❌ Bad: `try: response = await api.get(); data = response["temp"] / 10; ...`
  - ✅ Good: `try: response = await api.get(); except ApiError as err: ...; data = response["temp"] / 10`
  - Process data outside try blocks to avoid masking processing errors

# Code Organization
- Extract duplicated logic into helper functions/methods.
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose.
- Use descriptive variable names that explain intent.
- Prefer early returns to reduce nesting.
- Group related functionality together (e.g., all optimistic update logic near each other).
- Use constants for magic numbers and strings (define in const.py).
- Avoid deep nesting (max 3-4 levels); extract nested logic into helper functions.

# Observability & Diagnostics
- Track connection metrics (latency, failures, reconnects) for troubleshooting.
- Implement diagnostics platform (async_get_config_entry_diagnostics) for HA integrations.
- Provide actionable recommendations in diagnostics (e.g., "increase timeout").
- Use dataclasses for structured metrics and state tracking.
- Log key metrics at DEBUG level with context (device_id, latency_ms, error types).

# Modern Python Patterns
- Use ellipsis (...) instead of pass for empty exception classes and placeholders.
- Avoid unnecessary lambda wrappers; pass callables directly when possible.
- Remove unused imports (caught by Ruff F401).
- Use appropriate format specifiers: %.0f for floats, %d for ints.
- Prefer direct callable references over lambda: x when lambda just wraps a function.
- Walrus operator (:=) is acceptable but prefer simpler code if formatters conflict.
- Use bare `raise` instead of `raise exc` when re-raising exceptions to preserve tracebacks.
- Extract magic numbers and hardcoded strings to named constants in const.py.

# Performance
- Guard expensive debug operations with `if _LOGGER.isEnabledFor(logging.DEBUG):`.
- Avoid redundant string formatting or data structure operations in hot paths.
- Use dict.get() with defaults instead of key checks when appropriate.
- Prefer list comprehensions over loops for simple transformations (readability permitting).
- Cache expensive computations when safe to do so.

# Async Patterns & Concurrency
- The client uses 100% async/await patterns with no threading
  - Uses `asyncio.Task` for background operations (`_recv_task` for WebSocket receiver)
  - All WebSocket operations use native async: `websockets.connect()`, `ws.send()`, `ws.recv()`
  - All timeouts use `asyncio.wait_for()` with built-in `TimeoutError`
- Never block the Home Assistant event loop
  - All I/O operations must be async (await websockets, httpx async client)
  - Use `hass.async_add_executor_job` only if calling truly synchronous/blocking third-party code
  - Avoid `time.sleep()` - use `await asyncio.sleep()` instead
- Background async task management
  - Store tasks as `self._recv_task: asyncio.Task | None = None`
  - Create tasks with `asyncio.create_task()` or `hass.async_create_task()`
  - Cancel tasks with `task.cancel()` and optionally `await task` to collect CancelledError
  - Always set task references to None after cancellation
- Async exception handling
  - Use built-in `TimeoutError` for `asyncio.wait_for()` timeouts (not `asyncio.TimeoutError`)
  - Catch `OSError` for network errors (replaces old `WebSocketConnectionClosedException`)
  - Use `asyncio.CancelledError` for handling cancelled tasks
  - Always clean up resources (close connections, cancel tasks) in finally blocks
- Async context managers
  - Use `async with` for resources that support it (e.g., `async with websockets.connect() as ws`)
  - Ensure proper cleanup even if exceptions occur
- Testing async code
  - Mock async functions with `AsyncMock` from `unittest.mock`
  - Mock `websockets.connect` with `patch(..., new_callable=AsyncMock)`
  - Mock WebSocket methods (`send`, `recv`, `close`) as `AsyncMock` objects
  - Use `asyncio.sleep(0.1)` in tests to allow background tasks to process messages
  - Always await async mocks to avoid "coroutine was never awaited" warnings

# Common Mistakes to Avoid
These patterns violate HA best practices and should never appear in FanSync code:

## ❌ Anti-Patterns
- **Hardcoded entity names**: Use `_attr_translation_key = "fan"` not `_attr_name = "Fan"`
- **Accessing hass.data in tests**: Use `entry.runtime_data` not `hass.data[DOMAIN][entry.entry_id]`
- **Bare Exception catches**: Use `except (ValueError, KeyError):` not `except Exception:`
- **Processing in try blocks**: Only wrap the API call, process data outside
- **Blocking calls**: Use `await asyncio.sleep()` not `time.sleep()`
- **BleakClient reuse**: Create fresh instances for each connection (if using Bluetooth)
- **User-configurable polling**: Integration determines intervals, not users (FanSync exempt for diagnostics)
- **Sensitive data in diagnostics**: Use `async_redact_data()` for api_key, password, token

## ✅ Correct Patterns
- Entity names via translation keys (translatable)
- Test setup via config entry and fixtures
- Specific exception types with logging
- Minimal try block scope
- Async operations with proper cleanup
- Fresh client instances per connection
- Integration-determined update intervals
- Redacted diagnostics data
