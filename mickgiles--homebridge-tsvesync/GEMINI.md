TypeScript and Homebridge Plugin Development Guidelines

General TypeScript Guidelines

Core Principles
	•	Language and Documentation: All code and documentation must be written in English.
	•	Type Safety: Types must be explicitly declared for all variables and functions, including parameters and return values.
	•	Avoid any: Refrain from using the any type. Create specific types when necessary to ensure type safety.
	•	Documentation: Document all public classes and methods using JSDoc to enhance readability and maintainability.
	•	Code Structure: Maintain a clean code structure without blank lines within functions to ensure concise and readable code.
	•	Export Strategy: Follow the single export per file principle to promote modularity and clarity.

Naming Conventions

Case Styles
	•	Classes: Use PascalCase for class names (e.g., LightAccessory).
	•	Variables, Functions, and Methods: Use camelCase for naming (e.g., isConnected, initializeDevice).
	•	Files and Directories: Use kebab-case for file and directory names (e.g., light-accessory.ts).
	•	Environment Variables: Use UPPERCASE for environment variable names (e.g., HOMEKIT_PIN).

Naming Rules
	•	Avoid Magic Numbers: Replace magic numbers with named constants to improve code clarity (e.g., const DEFAULT_BRIGHTNESS = 100;).
	•	Function Names: Begin all function names with a verb to indicate action (e.g., getStatus, setBrightness).
	•	Boolean Variables: Use verb prefixes for boolean variables to clearly indicate their purpose (e.g., isOnline, hasError, canUpdate).
	•	Use Complete Words: Prefer complete words over abbreviations, except for:
	•	Standard Terms: Such as API, URL, etc.
	•	Common Programming Abbreviations:
	•	i, j for loop iterators
	•	err for errors
	•	ctx for contexts

Function Guidelines

General Rules
	•	Conciseness: Keep functions concise and focused, ideally under 20 instructions.
	•	Naming: Use verb-noun combinations for function names to clearly describe their actions (e.g., fetchDeviceStatus, updateFirmware).
	•	Return Type Prefixes:
	•	Boolean Returns: Use prefixes like isX, hasX, canX (e.g., isConnected).
	•	Void Returns: Use prefixes like executeX, saveX (e.g., executeCommand).

Best Practices
	•	Minimize Nesting:
	•	Utilize early returns and validation checks to reduce nested code blocks.
	•	Extract utility functions to handle repetitive tasks.
	•	Higher-Order Functions: Leverage higher-order functions such as map, filter, and reduce for data transformations.
	•	Arrow Functions: Implement arrow functions for simple operations with fewer than three instructions.
	•	Named Functions: Use named functions for more complex operations to enhance readability and debuggability.
	•	Default Parameters: Set default parameter values instead of performing null checks within functions.
	•	RO-RO Principle:
	•	Receive Object: Accept objects when a function requires multiple parameters.
	•	Return Object: Return objects when a function needs to provide multiple values.
	•	Abstraction Levels: Maintain a single level of abstraction within functions to ensure clarity and simplicity.

Data Management
	•	Composite Types: Encapsulate data within composite types (e.g., interfaces, classes) rather than using primitive types directly.
	•	Internal Validation: Use classes with internal validation logic instead of standalone validation functions to ensure data integrity.
	•	Immutability:
	•	Use readonly for static properties to prevent modification.
	•	Use as const for immutable literals to enforce constant values.

Class Design

SOLID Guidelines
	•	SOLID Principles: Adhere to SOLID principles to create robust and maintainable classes.
	•	Composition Over Inheritance: Favor composition to build complex functionalities from simpler components rather than relying heavily on inheritance.
	•	Interface Contracts: Define clear contracts through interfaces to ensure consistent implementation and facilitate testing.

Size Constraints
	•	Manageable Classes:
	•	Limit classes to a maximum of 200 instructions to maintain readability.
	•	Restrict to a maximum of 10 public methods to ensure focused responsibilities.
	•	Limit to a maximum of 10 properties to avoid complexity.

Error Handling
	•	Use Exceptions: Employ exceptions for unexpected error scenarios to manage unexpected states gracefully.
	•	Exception Handling Practices:
	•	Address anticipated issues with appropriate error messages.
	•	Provide additional context to errors to aid in debugging.
	•	Defer to global error handlers when suitable to centralize error management.

Testing Practices

General Testing
	•	Testing Structure: Organize tests using the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern to ensure clarity and consistency.
	•	Naming Conventions: Use clear and descriptive variable names in tests, such as inputData, mockDevice, actualResult, expectedOutcome.
	•	Unit Tests: Write unit tests for all public functions to verify their behavior in isolation.
	•	Test Doubles: Implement test doubles (mocks, stubs) for dependencies to isolate units under test, except for lightweight third-party dependencies.
	•	Acceptance Tests: Create acceptance tests per module using the Given-When-Then format to validate end-to-end functionality.

Homebridge Plugin Specific Guidelines

Architectural Structure

Plugin Organization
	•	Modular Architecture: Implement a modular architecture to separate concerns and enhance maintainability.
	•	Plugin Structure: Structure your Homebridge plugin with clear directories and files, such as:
	•	Accessories: Define accessory classes that represent HomeKit accessories.
	•	Services: Implement services that handle specific functionalities of accessories.
	•	Types: Define TypeScript types and interfaces for strong type safety.
	•	Utils: Include utility functions and helpers for common tasks.
	•	Main Entry Point: Create a single entry point file (e.g., index.ts) that registers the plugin with Homebridge.

Core Components
	•	Accessory Classes:
	•	Extend Homebridge’s AccessoryPlugin interface to create custom accessories.
	•	Implement required methods like getServices to define the services provided by the accessory.
	•	Service Implementations:
	•	Utilize Homebridge’s built-in services or create custom services as needed.
	•	Implement characteristics with appropriate getters and setters to interact with HomeKit.
	•	Configuration Management:
	•	Define clear and validated configuration schemas using class-validator or similar libraries.
	•	Provide default configurations where applicable to simplify setup.

Shared Resources
	•	Utility Functions: Place common utility functions in a shared directory to promote reusability.
	•	Common Business Logic: Encapsulate shared business logic in separate modules to avoid duplication and enhance clarity.

Best Practices
	•	Domain-Specific Modules: Keep modules focused on specific domains or functionalities to maintain clarity and separation of concerns.
	•	DTO Validation: Implement robust validation at the Data Transfer Object (DTO) level to ensure incoming configurations and data are valid.
	•	Separation of Concerns: Maintain a clear separation between different parts of the plugin, such as configuration handling, accessory management, and service implementation.
	•	Dependency Injection: Follow Homebridge’s patterns for dependency injection to manage dependencies efficiently and promote testability.
	•	Appropriate Decorators: Use TypeScript decorators where applicable to enhance code readability and functionality, such as for dependency injection or metadata definition.

Integration with Homebridge APIs
	•	Homebridge Interfaces: Utilize Homebridge’s provided interfaces and classes to ensure compatibility and leverage built-in functionalities.
	•	Event Handling: Implement event listeners for Homebridge events to respond to changes in accessory states or HomeKit interactions.
	•	Asynchronous Operations: Handle asynchronous operations using async/await to maintain readability and manage promises effectively.
	•	Logging: Use Homebridge’s logging mechanisms to provide meaningful logs for debugging and monitoring plugin behavior.

Plugin Registration
	•	Registering Accessories: Ensure all accessories are properly registered with Homebridge using the api.registerAccessory method.
	•	Plugin Metadata: Define clear and accurate metadata in the package.json file, including name, version, description, and dependencies.
	•	Compatibility: Ensure compatibility with the latest Homebridge versions and adhere to any API changes or deprecations.

Configuration Handling
	•	Schema Definitions: Define clear configuration schemas using TypeScript interfaces and validate configurations during plugin initialization.
	•	Default Values: Provide sensible default values for configuration options to simplify user setup and prevent errors.
	•	Error Reporting: Report configuration errors clearly to guide users in correcting their setup.

Performance Considerations
	•	Efficient Code: Write efficient code to minimize the performance impact on Homebridge and ensure responsive interactions with HomeKit.
	•	Resource Management: Manage resources effectively, such as network connections or file handles, to prevent leaks and ensure stability.
	•	Asynchronous Operations: Optimize asynchronous operations to prevent blocking the event loop and maintain plugin responsiveness.

Security Practices
	•	Input Validation: Rigorously validate all inputs and configurations to prevent security vulnerabilities.
	•	Sensitive Data Handling: Handle sensitive data, such as credentials, securely by using environment variables or secure storage mechanisms.
	•	Dependency Management: Regularly update dependencies to address security vulnerabilities and maintain plugin integrity.
