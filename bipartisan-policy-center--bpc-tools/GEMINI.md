## Tool inventory

### 1. Auto Loan Interest Deduction Calculator
**File:** `calculators/auto-loan-interest/auto_interest_calc_embed.html`
**Status:** Live on bipartisanpolicy.org (EPP section)
**Purpose:** Interactive calculator for the 2026 auto loan interest deduction. Users input
income, loan amount, and interest rate; the tool computes estimated deduction and tax savings
with eligibility phaseout logic.

**Key implementation notes:**
- Scoped under `.bpc-auto-calc` wrapper to prevent CSS bleed into WP theme
- All element IDs prefixed with `bpc-` to avoid DOM collisions
- Uses document-level event delegation (not element queries) for WordPress compatibility
- `PHASEOUT_RATE` is `0.20` (updated from original `0.10` per EPP research team, April 2026)
- Versioned with changelog comments in the script block

**WordPress Custom HTML block constraints** (applies to ALL tools in this repo):
1. No `&&` — WP entity-encodes it to `&#038;&#038;`, breaking execution → use nested `if` statements
2. No raw non-ASCII characters (em dash, ▾, ▸, etc.) — use `\uXXXX` Unicode escapes
3. No apostrophes inside single-quoted JS strings → use double quotes or rephrase
- `||`, comparison operators (`<`, `>`, `<=`), and all standard ASCII survive intact

---

### 2. U.S. ISO/RTO Interactive Map
**File:** `maps/iso-rto/isorto_map.html`
**Status:** Built; embed status TBD
**Purpose:** Leaflet.js map of U.S. ISO/RTO electricity market regions with clickable regions,
detail panel (org name, states served, market type, emissions info, peak MW, population), and
legend with click-to-highlight.

**Key implementation notes:**
- Uses real ISO/RTO boundary GeoJSON (FERC/EIA source), simplified from ~31MB to ~550KB
  using Shapely — do not replace with the full-size file
- GeoJSON loaded at runtime from a relative path or CDN; confirm path is correct on deploy
- Seven regions covered: ISO-NE, PJM, MISO, SPP, NYISO, CAISO, ERCOT
- Companion Datawrapper-ready county-level CSV exists separately (not in this repo)
- BPC brand colors used for region fills; DM Sans for map UI font
- `Boundaries as of 2022` noted in panel footer

---

### 3. State PFML Comparison Table
**File:** `tables/state-pfml/pfl_table.html`
**Status:** Live on bipartisanpolicy.org (PFML explainer page)
**Purpose:** Tabbed HTML table comparing mandatory vs. voluntary state paid family and medical
leave programs across all 50 states. Tabs: All / Mandatory / Voluntary.

**Key implementation notes:**
- Data source: `2026-4_State_PFL_Comparisons_Table.xlsx` (BPC SharePoint)
- All `th` background/color rules require `!important` to override BPC WordPress theme
- Virginia appears in BOTH tabs:
  - Mandatory: added when Gov. Spanberger signed (late April 2026); job protection
    caveat is "Yes, if employed by current employer for 120+ days"
  - Voluntary: "Superseded" badge present — Virginia's 2022 voluntary law predates
    the 2026 mandatory program
- Footnote explains AWW, SAWW, Pending, Superseded abbreviations
- FAQ schema block (`FAQPage` JSON-LD) is a separate embed on the same page — not in this file
- `bpcPflTab()` JS function handles tab switching; uses `aria-selected` for accessibility
- Trailing `&nbsp;`/`<br>` WP artifacts addressed with a JS cleanup block at bottom

**Tab counts as of last update (April 23, 2026):**
- Mandatory: 14 states + D.C.
- Voluntary: 10 states

---

### 4. Housing Bills Comparison Modal
**File:** `modals/housing-bills-comparison/housing_modal.html`
**Status:** Live on bipartisanpolicy.org (housing bills page)
**Purpose:** Embeds a Datawrapper comparison chart (ID: cvs16, height 14,668px) in a
modal to avoid forcing excessive page scroll. Two side-by-side buttons trigger the modal
and link to a companion PDF download.

**Key implementation notes:**
- Modal has no title header — uses a floating `position:absolute` close button in top-right
  corner of the modal card
- Buttons: "View the Comparison Table" + "Download the Table"
  - Download links to: `https://bipartisanpolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/04/Table-2.0-Policies-in-ROAD-and-21st-Century.pdf`
- Button styling: `padding: 14px 28px`, `font-size: 18px`, flex row centered
- Datawrapper iframe: `cvs16`, height hardcoded to `14668px` inside a fixed-height scrollable wrapper
- All WP Custom HTML constraints apply (no `&&`, no non-ASCII, no apostrophes in single-quoted strings)

---

### 5. Newsletter Email QA Checker *(internal tool)*
**File:** `internal-tools/email-qa/email_qa_checker.html`
**Status:** Built; hosted as standalone HTML (Netlify Drop or SharePoint embed recommended)
**Purpose:** Fully client-side HTML analyzer for non-technical staff. Paste email HTML,
get plain-English flagged issues. Catches Word-paste artifacts before send.

**Key implementation notes:**
- No API key, no backend — pure client-side pattern matching
- Uses the Anthropic `/v1/messages` API via artifact fetch for AI-powered analysis
  (falls back gracefully if fetch is blocked in the deployment environment)
- Checks for: `mso-` styles, Word XML namespaces, curly quotes, `&nbsp;` near links,
  Faustina font declarations, missing alt text, CSS style blocks, broken href, `<br>` in anchors
- Each issue identifies the specific offending element by link text or image description
- Removed checks (intentionally): unsubscribe/footer (SFMC auto-handles), image dimensions (template handles)
- Output severity: `high` / `medium` / `low` / `ok`
- Intended users: junior comms staff building SFMC emails, not developers

---

### 6. GA4 Slug + Traffic Explorer *(internal tool)*
**File:** `internal-tools/ga4-slug-explorer/bpc_slug_traffic.html`
**Status:** Built; used by Alex for ad hoc content audits
**Purpose:** Browser-based filterable dashboard. Upload a GA4 Pages export CSV and filter
by content type, policy area, publish date, traffic threshold. Outputs slug lists for use in
paid media, SEO audits, Snitcher setup, etc.

**Key implementation notes:**
- Browser-based by design — BPC's Cloudflare WAF blocks server-side REST API calls,
  so this runs in the user's browser to pass real browser headers
- Supports two export formats:
  1. Standard GA4 Pages report (page_path + sessions/views)
  2. GA4 Exploration export with custom dimensions: `policy_area`, `content_type`,
     `publish_date`, `content_age_bucket`
- Content type is inferred from path prefix (`/article/`, `/report/`, `/explainer/`, etc.)
  when not present in the export
- Known data quirk: `policy_area` is event-scoped in GA4 (not session/page-scoped),
  causing ~65% undercounting in Exploration exports — filter results accordingly
- Export as CSV or copy slug list to clipboard

## BPC brand tokens (shared across all tools)

```css

/* Typefaces: Faustina (serif), Source Sans 3 — loaded sitewide, don't re-import */
/* CSS scope on WordPress pages: .bpc2 */
```

  `content_age_bucket`, `content_type`, `policy_area`, `click_section`, `source_page`,
  `file_url`, `file_name`, `form_location`, `percent_scrolled`

## WordPress Custom HTML block — quick reference

Always validate embeds against these three rules before final paste:

| Risk | Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Raw non-ASCII in `<script>` | Corrupted characters on save | Replace with `\uXXXX` escapes |
| `&&` in `<script>` | `&#038;&#038;` breaks JS execution | Replace with nested `if` statements |
| Apostrophe in single-quoted JS string | Syntax error, script silent | Switch to double quotes |

Everything else — `||`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, standard ASCII — survives WP sanitization intact.
