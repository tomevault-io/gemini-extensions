# Genealogical Simulation Project - Cursor Rules

## Project Overview
A genealogical simulation system that models populations of creatures with genetic traits across multiple generations. The system simulates breeding strategies, genetic inheritance, mutations, and provides comprehensive post-simulation reporting and analysis.

## Core Domain Entities
- **Creatures**: Entities with diploid genomes, genotypes, and phenotypes
- **Traits**: Genetic characteristics supporting multiple inheritance patterns (simple Mendelian, incomplete dominance, codominance, sex-linked, polygenic)
- **Breeders**: Pluggable breeding strategies (random, selective, inbreeding avoidance; fitness-based in Phase 2)
- **Mutations**: Point mutations with configurable rates, tracked through generations with complete history (Phase 2)
- **Populations**: Groups of creatures evolving over generations with demographic tracking
- **Generations**: Time-series snapshots of population state
- **Simulations**: Complete experimental runs with configuration and results
- **Reporting**: Post-simulation charts, graphs, and data exports (CSV/JSON)

## Key Design Principles

### 1. Genetic Accuracy
- Implement Mendelian inheritance with expected ratios (3:1, 9:3:3:1, etc.)
- Maintain Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium under random mating with no selection
- Support sex-linked traits with correct inheritance patterns
- Validate mutation rates match configured parameters (Phase 2)

### 2. Extensibility
- Use strategy pattern for breeding algorithms (pluggable and testable)
- Define traits as data (YAML/JSON configuration), not code
- Support custom trait types through configuration
- Clear interfaces for extending functionality

### 3. Reproducibility
- All randomness must use seeded pRNG (NumPy random with explicit seed)
- Store pRNG seed with each simulation run for exact reproduction
- Same seed + configuration = identical results
- Deterministic behavior is critical for scientific validity

### 4. Performance Requirements
- Small sim (100 creatures, 50 gen): < 5 seconds
- Medium sim (1,000 creatures, 100 gen): < 60 seconds
- Large sim (10,000 creatures, 100 gen): < 10 minutes
- Memory usage (1,000 creatures): < 500 MB
- Use NumPy arrays for genetic operations
- Batch database operations where possible
- Pre-aggregate statistics during simulation

### 5. Data Integrity
- Complete lineage tracking (forward and backward traversal)
- All mutation events individually traceable (Phase 2)
- SQLite foreign keys enforce referential integrity
- ACID compliance ensures data consistency
- No data loss across generations

### 6. Reporting-First Architecture
- Design for post-simulation analysis, not real-time visualization
- Store all data in SQLite for efficient querying
- Support time-series queries (trait frequencies by generation)
- Enable lineage queries without loading entire simulation
- Optimize indexes for common reporting patterns

## Technology Stack
- **Language**: Python 3.10+
- **Database**: SQLite (built-in, no external server)
- **Numerical**: NumPy for efficient arrays and seeded random number generation
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib/Plotly (optional, for reporting)
- **Data Export**: Pandas for CSV/JSON and SQLite querying
- **Configuration**: YAML/JSON parsing
- **Testing**: pytest with >80% coverage target

## Code Style & Conventions

### Python Standards
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints for all function signatures and class attributes
- Prefer dataclasses or Pydantic models for data structures
- Use enums for trait types and other fixed sets of values
- Document all public APIs with docstrings (Google style)

### File Organization
- Domain models in `models/` package (creature, trait, breeder, etc.)
- Simulation engine in `simulation/` package
- Database layer in `database/` package
- Reporting/analysis in `reporting/` package
- Configuration loading in `config/` package
- Tests mirror source structure in `tests/`

### Naming Conventions
- Classes: PascalCase (e.g., `Creature`, `Trait`, `RandomBreeder`)
- Functions/methods: snake_case (e.g., `select_mates`, `is_eligible_for_breeding`; `calculate_fitness` in Phase 2)
- Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `MAX_TRAIT_ID`, `DEFAULT_MUTATION_RATE`)
- Database tables: plural snake_case (e.g., `creatures`, `traits`, `genotypes`)

### Error Handling
- Use custom exception classes for domain-specific errors
- Validate inputs at boundaries (configuration loading, API entry points)
- Fail fast with clear error messages
- Log errors with sufficient context for debugging

## Database Design

### SQLite Schema Principles
- Use foreign keys with ON DELETE CASCADE where appropriate
- Create indexes for common query patterns (birth_generation, trait_id, lineage)
- Store pRNG seed with each simulation for reproducibility
- Normalize where it improves query performance
- Use CHECK constraints for data validation (trait_id range 0-99, etc.)

### Query Optimization
- Prefer indexed columns in WHERE clauses
- Use batch inserts for generation data
- Aggregate statistics during simulation, not during reporting
- Support efficient time-series queries (generation-based filtering)

## Testing Requirements

### Test Coverage
- Target >80% code coverage
- Unit tests for all domain logic
- Integration tests for simulation workflows
- Validation tests for genetic accuracy (Mendelian ratios, Hardy-Weinberg)

### Test Organization
- One test file per source module
- Use fixtures for common test data (sample creatures, traits, populations)
- Test deterministic behavior with fixed seeds
- Validate performance targets in integration tests

## Configuration System

### Trait Definitions
- YAML/JSON format for trait configuration
- Validate trait definitions on load (frequencies sum to 1.0, unique IDs, etc.)
- Support trait_id range 0-99 (used as array indices)
- Explicit genotype-to-phenotype mappings (no implicit rules)

### Simulation Configuration
- Include initial population parameters
- Specify breeding strategy and parameters
- Set mutation rates and types (Phase 2)
- Define number of generations
- Include pRNG seed for reproducibility

## Documentation Standards

### Code Documentation
- Module-level docstrings explaining purpose and key concepts
- Class docstrings describing responsibilities and key attributes
- Function docstrings with parameters, return values, and examples
- Inline comments for complex genetic algorithms or non-obvious logic

### Architecture Documentation
- Keep `docs/requirements.md` updated with current scope
- Document domain models in `docs/models/` (one file per entity)
- Update `docs/domain-model.md` as entities are completed
- Document API contracts before implementation

## Current Development Phase
**Context Engineering** - Defining architecture and design before implementation. Focus on:
- Completing domain model specifications
- Designing SQLite schema for efficient querying
- Defining API contracts and interfaces
- Planning test strategy
- **See `docs/TODO.md` for remaining design work before implementation**

## When Writing Code

### Before Implementing
1. Check `docs/TODO.md` for remaining design work
2. Check existing domain model docs in `docs/models/`
3. Review requirements in `docs/requirements.md`
4. Ensure design aligns with SQLite-first reporting architecture
5. Consider performance implications for large populations

### During Implementation
1. Write tests alongside code (TDD approach)
2. Use type hints throughout
3. Validate inputs at module boundaries
4. Use seeded random number generation (never global random)
5. Batch database operations for performance

### After Implementation
1. Ensure tests pass and coverage meets target
2. Update relevant documentation
3. Verify performance targets are met
4. Check that deterministic behavior works (same seed = same results)

## Common Patterns

### Random Number Generation
```python
import numpy as np

# Always use explicit generator with seed
rng = np.random.default_rng(seed=simulation.seed)

# Never use global random
# BAD: np.random.choice(...)
# GOOD: rng.choice(...)
```

### Trait ID Usage
- Trait IDs are integers 0-99, used as array indices
- Creature genomes stored as arrays: `genome[trait_id] = genotype`
- Validate trait_id range in all functions accepting trait_id

### Database Transactions
- Use transactions for generation-level operations
- Commit after each generation for data safety
- Use batch inserts for performance (creatures, genotypes)
