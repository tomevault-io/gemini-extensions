# CLAUDE.md — Working guide for this repository

This file is the onboarding brief for an agent (or contributor) picking up a task
here. It captures the project structure, the build/test/release procedures, the
tools, and the decided constraints — so you can start work without re-discovering
the codebase. Keep it accurate: update it when procedures or constraints change.

---

## 1. What this repository is

Two Manifest V3 browser extensions (Chrome **and** Firefox) that organize AI
conversations into folders and provide a reusable prompt library:

- **Gemini Folders (GF)** — Google Gemini only. Current version **4.6.0**.
- **AI Folders (AF)** — 18 web platforms (Gemini, Claude, ChatGPT, Copilot,
  DeepSeek, Grok, Perplexity, Baidu, Z.ai, Kimi, Qwen, Meta AI, Mistral, Poe,
  Duck.ai, You.com, Pi, Character.AI) **+ a user-configured local LLM**.
  Current version **1.7.0**. The popup's per-site "new conversation" buttons
  are generated from the `SITES` registry (site-config.js) into wrapping
  grid rows — adding a site does not touch popup.html.
  **Site logos**: the extension ships pre-rasterized PNGs
  (`extensions/ai-folders/icons/`, some with a `-light` theme variant) —
  inline SVG `url(#gradient)` fills do NOT render in the popup, don't go back
  to them. The vector sources live in `assets/site-logos/` (reference for the
  website/screenshots/videos); regenerate the PNGs with
  `node tools/generate-site-icons.js` (needs Chrome) after changing one.
  Gemini Folders has an `icons/` directory too, holding only `gemini.png` — the
  welcome page's site row needs the real Gemini mark, which is not the same image
  as GF's own `icon.svg` (§10). Keep the two `gemini.png` copies identical.

Both are built from one shared codebase in `src/`, with a thin per-extension
overlay in `extensions/<name>/`. The build merges the two.

## 3. Build, test, run

**Tests** (fast, run these constantly):
```bash
npx jest                 # full suite
```

**Build** (runs Jest first and **aborts** if it fails):
```bash
python build.py          # interactive
python build.py --yes    # non-interactive (also -y); use this in automation
python build.py --force  # build anyway on a red suite — deliberate use only
```
`--yes` only suppresses prompts; it does **not** wave through a test gate that
did not pass (it used to, which meant a green `🎉 Build finished` proved nothing).
That covers **both** a red suite and a suite that could not be executed at all —
the second case tells you even less than the first. Only `--force` continues.

**Validate what was built:**
```bash
python tools/validate_build.py   # after build.py; exits 1 and lists every problem
```
Checks the four built manifests (version, **permission drift**, no `"tabs"`,
Firefox gecko id), 43 locales with parseable `messages.json`, no unresolved
`__PLACEHOLDER__`, and that each ZIP has a root manifest, `_locales`, and no
`tools/`/`Marketing/`/`tests/` files. Run by CI's `build` job.
The build copies `src/` then overlays `extensions/<name>/` into
`dist/<name>/{chrome,firefox}`, patches the manifest + locales for Firefox, and
emits versioned `.zip` files. `dist/` is gitignored.

**Manual load (dev mode):**
- Chrome: `chrome://extensions` → Developer mode → Load unpacked →
  `dist/ai-folders/chrome/` or `dist/gemini-folders/chrome/`.
- Firefox: `about:debugging` → This Firefox → Load Temporary Add-on →
  `manifest.json` inside `dist/<name>/firefox/`.

---

## 4. Git & CI procedure — DO NOT push to `main` directly

`main` is protected: every change must go through a **pull request** that passes
**5 required status checks** — `test`, `build`, `Analyze (javascript-typescript)`,
`Analyze (actions)`, `Analyze (python)` (the three `Analyze` checks come from
CodeQL *default setup*, configured on GitHub with no workflow file; `python` was
added to the required list on 09/08/2026, CodeQL having started scanning
`build.py` and the `tools/` scripts). Branch protection also requires **1
approving review**, which a solo maintainer cannot self-provide.

The **`build`** job in `.github/workflows/test.yml` packages both extensions for
both browsers, runs `tools/validate_build.py`, then fails if the build dirtied a
tracked file. It was added to the required list on 15/08/2026, so a packaging
regression — a dropped file, a drifted permission, a generated artifact left
uncommitted — now blocks the merge instead of surfacing at release time.

Standard flow (the `--admin` on merge overrides *only* the impossible self-review;
the 5 checks still gate the change):
```bash
git checkout -b <branch>
# ... commit work ...
git push -u origin <branch>
gh pr create --base main --fill
gh pr checks --watch                       # wait for the 5 checks to go green
gh pr merge --squash --admin --delete-branch
git checkout main && git pull --ff-only
```
- End commit messages with: `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.8 <noreply@anthropic.com>`
- End PR bodies with the Claude Code footer.
- The repo is `dlamarre-dev/AI-Gemini-Folders`; `gh` is authenticated.

## 5. Verification after a change

1. `npx jest` — all green.
2. `python build.py --yes` — completes without error.
3. Load `dist/ai-folders/chrome/` and `dist/gemini-folders/chrome/` and manually
   verify the touched area, in **both** Folder and Prompt modes and **both** light
   and dark themes.
4. **If you touched prompt injection** (`injectPromptIntoEditor` /
   `insertSuggestionsInEditor` / `background.js` / `site-config.js`): re-test the
   `#` trigger and the ▶ insert button on the affected sites + a local LLM. This is
   the most fragile area and cannot be covered by unit tests.

---

## 6. Decided constraints — don't re-litigate these

- **`background.js` is NOT shared** between GF and AF (deliberate). Fix bugs in
  both copies.
- **`site-config.js` is NOT merged** between the two extensions.
- **New i18n key** → add it to all 43 `_locales/*/messages.json` of **both**
  extensions. Prefer **reusing existing keys** wherever possible.
- **Store text (`Marketing/`)** must never contain comma-separated brand lists
  (Chrome Web Store keyword-spam rejection, hit 3× historically). Prose such as
  "platforms such as Claude, ChatGPT and Gemini" is fine; bare keyword lists are not.
- **~2px transparent gap on the right of the popup** at fractional Windows DPI
  (125/150%): a device-pixel rounding artifact, **outside the document → not
  fixable in CSS**. Disappears at 100% scaling. Accepted as-is. **Never** retry
  scrollbar/overflow CSS variants for it; don't touch `overflow-y` /
  `scrollbar-gutter` in `popup.css` without a separate reason.
- **Data is keyed by folder name and conversation URL** (no stable IDs). Renames,
  pins and migrations are awkward by design (see TODO §8). Because those keys are
  user-typed names on ordinary objects, **every existence check must go through
  `hasEntry(container, name)`** (`src/utils.js`), never plain truthiness — including
  the import merge, where a truthy inherited name silently created orphan pins and
  renamed incoming prompts to `<name> (Imported)` against a collision that did not
  exist.
  `folders[name]` is truthy for *every* member of `Object.prototype`, so a folder
  called `toString` or `valueOf` skipped its "create if missing" guard and then
  threw on `.some()` — a blacklist can never be complete, which is why the old
  three-name `isUnsafeKey` was the wrong shape of fix. With an ownership test
  those names simply work as ordinary titles. `isUnsafeKey` now rejects exactly
  one name, `__proto__`: assigning it invokes the prototype setter instead of
  creating a property, so the entry is never stored and `JSON.stringify` emits
  `{}`. Rejection is surfaced as `reservedNameError`.
- **Marketing screenshots** are regenerated only at release time
  (`python build_images.py`), not on every change.

---

## 7. Architecture notes (so you don't rediscover them)

- **Storage:** `loadData`/`saveData` (utils.js) transparently compress (LZString)
  and chunk content across `storage.sync` (quota ~100 KB total, 8 KB per item;
  `makeChunks`/`assembleChunks`).
  **Write first, delete second — never the reverse.** The chunks and their
  `fdcN`/`pdcN` pointer go out in a *single* `sync.set`, whose quota Chrome
  evaluates as a unit, so that call is the commit point. Every superseded key is
  removed in `runCleanup()`, only after that set confirms. Doing the removes first
  (as the code did until 2026-08) loses data on a failed write: the shrink case
  deletes the tail chunks, the set fails, the surviving pointer references keys
  that are gone, `assembleChunks` returns garbage, and `loadData` silently falls
  back to `{}` — every folder appears empty. **Do not "fix" this with generation-
  prefixed chunks:** two generations coexisting doubles peak usage against a
  *shared* 100 KB ceiling, so anyone above ~50 % would stop being able to save at
  all — a worse regression than the bug, for a guarantee the single set already
  gives. Errors must reach the caller: `saveData` passes a message for both sync
  *and* local failures, `mergeImportData` rejects, and both `background.js` use
  `saveDataAsync`/`saveOrReportError` so a failed quick-save shows
  `storageFullError` instead of "✅ Saved!" (a service worker has no `window`, so
  the modal fallback never fires there). UI open-state (`openFolders`/`openPrompts`) lives
  in `storage.local` — device-local, to avoid burning the sync write quota.
  `finishSave(..., affectsBookmarks)` only rebuilds the bookmark mirror when
  folders/pins/sort actually change. Default sort is `dateDesc` (newest-first) for
  both folders and prompts.
- **Prompt trigger:** `prompt-trigger.js` runs as a content script (isolated world)
  and only *detects* `#name`; the actual injection is delegated to `background.js`
  via `chrome.scripting.executeScript({ world: 'MAIN', func: ... })`. The injected
  prompt text comes from the user's own storage, gated by `getSiteByUrl(sender.url)`
  — a page cannot drive it (no `externally_connectable`).
  **Every listener starts with `isRealUserEvent(e)` (`e.isTrusted === true`) and that
  is load-bearing security, not hygiene.** The content script shares the DOM with the
  page, so script on a supported site could otherwise forge `#` + Space, get the whole
  prompt list back (an empty prefix matches everything), read the titles out of the
  composer, then request each body — the entire library, no user interaction. The
  site check cannot help: the attacker *is* the supported site. `dispatchEvent` can
  never set `isTrusted`, so the gate is complete. jsdom cannot make a trusted event
  either, which is why the four handlers (`onSpaceKeydown` etc.) are exported and
  tested directly while `tests/prompt-trigger-events.test.js` dispatches real
  synthetic events to prove the gate holds. Behind it, both `background.js` add
  `isTrustedSender` (own extension id, main frame only) and resolve the target tab
  via `resolveTriggerTabId` — AF's active-tab fallback for Firefox's dynamically
  registered local-LLM script only fires when the active tab is the **same origin**
  that spoke, so a background tab can never drive an injection into another one.
- **Title extraction:** `extractTitleLogic` + per-site strategies in
  `site-config.js`, run via `executeScript`. Falls back to a heuristic (lowest
  sizeable text field) and logs `console.warn("[Folders extension] …")` when a
  selector stops matching.
- **Keyboard access:** custom dropdowns go through `makeMenuAccessible`
  (`src/ui.js`) — the sort menus in `popup-core.js`/`prompts.js` and the
  bulk-move list in `bulk-actions.js`. It adds the WAI menu-button roles, roving
  arrow-key focus, Enter/Space to choose and Escape to close, **without owning
  the open/close state**: each caller keeps its own show/hide code. It supports
  the two conventions in use — a `.show` class or the `hidden` attribute —
  detected once at wiring time (`usesHidden`); testing `!menu.hidden` on a plain
  `<div>` is always true and would make the menu look permanently open. Pass
  `{ radio: true }` for a single-choice menu (both sort menus): items become
  `menuitemradio` and `aria-checked` tracks the `.active` class via a
  MutationObserver, because that class is applied asynchronously by `loadData`.
  `aria-expanded` is re-synced from a **capture** listener on the menu — the
  bulk-move `<li>` stops propagation, so a bubble listener never sees the click.
  Keyboard-opened menus move focus to the first item, detected with
  `e.detail === 0`; `preventDefault` is not usable there since it would suppress
  the very click that opens the menu.
  `showCustomModal` carries `role="dialog"`/`aria-modal`/`aria-labelledby`, traps
  Tab and restores focus to the opener. Its focusable scan filters on inline
  `style.display`, **not `offsetParent`**, which is always null under jsdom.
  Folder and prompt headers already had `tabindex="0"` + `keydown` — that is the
  pattern to copy for anything new.
- **Prompt autosave:** inline edits go through one module-level slot committed by
  `flushPendingEdit` (`src/prompts.js`), called on blur, on `pagehide`, before
  rename/delete/pin and at the top of `displayPrompts`. **Its callback must not
  run until every queued commit has finished writing** — commits are serialized on
  a promise chain, because clearing the slot is synchronous while the load/save
  that follows is not: blur then Pin used to let Pin read the pre-edit text and
  save it back over the edit. Callers with nothing pending still get a synchronous
  callback, so re-renders are unaffected. Tests must use genuinely async storage
  mocks to see this; the synchronous ones hide every ordering bug.
- **Sub-folders (one level):** nesting lives in a **sibling sync key**,
  `folderParents: { child: parent }`, never on the folder itself — `folders[name]`
  is a bare array and every consumer relies on `Array.isArray` holding, so moving
  it into an object would need the migration this codebase has no mechanism for.
  An absent key defaults to `{}` through `loadData` exactly like `pinnedFolders`,
  so old installs and old backups need no conversion, and an old build ignores
  the key instead of dropping it. Child→parent rather than parent→children: a
  parent→children map can express "this folder has two parents", this cannot.
  Child *order* is never stored — it is derived by `sortFolderNames`, same as at
  root. **All the invariants live in `getFolderParent` / `canNestFolder` /
  `pruneFolderParents` (`src/utils.js`)**; nothing else should re-derive them.
  Depth is capped at one twice over: by `canNestFolder` on write, and by
  `buildFolderElement(name, ctx, isChild)` on read, where a child is built with
  `isChild = true` and never asks for children of its own — there is no recursion
  to bound. An **orphan** (parent deleted on another device) reads as a root
  folder without being deleted: a read must not write, and the parent may come
  back on the next sync; `pruneFolderParents` cleans up on the write side.
  **Nesting never touches `pinnedFolders`** — that is what makes a pin dormant
  while nested and live again at the top level, and it holds by doing nothing:
  the pin button is not rendered on a child, and children are sorted with an
  empty pin list so a dormant pin cannot reorder siblings.
  Consequences to know: `affectsBookmarks` (`saveData`) must fire on
  `folderParents` and both `background.js` must rebuild their menu on it, because
  nesting writes **no** `folders` at all; and folder names stay globally unique,
  so two parents cannot both hold a sub-folder called "Notes" — a direct
  consequence of the name-as-key design (§6) and the strongest argument yet for
  the stable-IDs item in §8.
  **Drag & drop:** the drag source is the `.folder-header`, and folder drags use
  `body.is-dragging-folder`, **not** `is-dragging` — the latter neutralizes
  pointer events on every descendant of a `.folder`, which includes the header
  being dragged, so the source stopped being hit-testable the instant the drag
  began and folders could not be dragged at all. (`body.is-dragging .dragging`
  exists for exactly the same reason on chat items.) `body.is-dragging .folder
  .folder--child` restores pointer events so a **conversation** can still be
  dropped into a sub-folder. Un-nesting is handled on the **document**: anywhere
  outside a folder card, since cards stop propagation. Indentation is a
  `margin-inline-start` on the nested card — never padding, which would have to
  out-`!important` the fragile compact block (§8).
- **Security posture:** folder/conversation titles render via `textContent` (no
  XSS); `link.href` is gated by `isSafeUrl` (falls back to `about:blank`); import
  is validated (`isSafeUrl` + shape checks + chunked writes); the local-LLM
  permission is requested **scoped to the entered origin only** (the broad
  `optional_host_permissions http(s)://*/*` is just the manifest pattern needed to
  request a dynamic origin at runtime — nothing is granted by default).
- **Opening a saved conversation** (`openConversation` / `pickReusableTab`,
  folders.js): a plain click activates the tab already showing that URL instead of
  spawning a duplicate; **Ctrl/Cmd-click reuses the last tab the extension opened**
  (`reuseTabId`, `storage.local`); middle-click and Shift-click are left 100% native,
  which is why the `<a href target="_blank">` must stay. The modifier *is* the
  consent for overwriting a tab — that is why there is deliberately no setting, and
  why its only discoverability is the second line of the link's tooltip
  (`chatLinkReuseHint`). That string carries a **`{k}` placeholder** filled by
  `currentModifierKeyLabel()` with `Cmd` on macOS and `Ctrl` elsewhere — never
  hardcode a key name into a translation, it would be wrong on half the machines
  (a test asserts all 43 × 2 keep `{k}` and spell out neither key).
  A remembered tab id is never trusted on its own: it is only
  a tiebreaker inside a candidate set recomputed per click (readable URL, not
  pinned, current window, `window.isSupportedTabUrl` — supplied per extension in
  `popup.js`, so folders.js stays site-agnostic). **Never add the `"tabs"` permission
  for this** — it triggers the "read your browsing history" warning and re-prompts
  every installed user. Without it `chrome.tabs.query({})` still lists every tab but
  populates `tab.url` only for hosts in `host_permissions`, so a tab we cannot read
  is by construction not ours and is never touched; `isSafeUrl` then excludes
  `chrome-extension:` (the popup's own page, `import.html`, `welcome.html`). The
  `url:` filter of `tabs.query` is off-limits for the same reason — filter in JS.
  Consequence to accept, not fix: a local-LLM conversation (AF) and everything on
  Firefox before the user grants host permissions degrade silently to "new tab".

## 8. Remaining improvement TODOs

The P1–P5 improvement plan is essentially complete. What's left:

- **`popup.css` cleanup:** flatten the stacked `!important` rules on
  `.action-btn` / `.folder-header` / `.chat-item` (around lines ~470–540) into
  single clean definitions. Purely cosmetic (code-side), delicate (1px-shift risk)
  — verify pixel-perfect against current rendering if done.
- **(Deferred)** Extract the inline styles out of `popup.html`. High churn, low
  value, no functional gain.
- **(P5 — discuss with David first)** Differential bookmark sync.
  `syncToBookmarksTree` deletes and recreates the whole bookmark tree on every
  content save; a diff (create/delete/move only what changed) would cut mobile-sync
  churn. Non-trivial (partial-state handling) — only worth it if users complain.
- **Site watch list** (checked 15/08/2026 with `tools/site-diagnostics`):
  - **You.com — kept, but untestable.** The consumer chat is closed to new
    subscribers, so its selectors can no longer be validated live. You.com turned
    its unlimited free plan into a 25-query Pro trial on **03/04/2026**
    (support.you.com, "Changes to You.com's Free plan") and `you.com/pricing` now
    lists **API plans only** — the consumer product is being wound down in
    practice. **No end-of-support date has been announced anywhere public**
    (checked the support KB, the pricing page, Wikipedia and the trade press), so
    there is no date to schedule a removal against. Re-check ~02/2027, or sooner
    if a user reports the site dead; removing it means the
    `you` entry in `site-config.js`, its host permissions in `manifest.json` +
    `background.js`, its icons, the README/`llms.txt`/`docs/site` service lists,
    and the store text.
  - **Baidu moved to `wenxin.baidu.com`** (08/2026). `chat.baidu.com` 302s there,
    which the manifest could not follow — hence the `wenxin` host permission and
    `altDomains: ['chat.baidu.com']`. A test now asserts every `SITES` domain and
    altDomain has a host permission, a content-script match and a
    `SUPPORTED_URL_PATTERNS` entry, so the next move fails in CI instead of in the
    field. Baidu's `editorSelectors` and the sidebar title strategy still need a
    live re-run on the new domain.
- **(P5 — discuss with David first)** Stable IDs for folders/conversations instead
  of name/URL keys. Would simplify renames/pins and enable the differential sync
  above, but requires a data migration — outside the "same features" scope; don't
  start without an explicit decision.

## 9. Uninstall feedback survey

When the user removes an extension, the browser opens a short survey page on the
website. Both halves are deliberately dumb: the extension only builds a URL, and
the page only posts to a Google Form. **There is no database and no backend.**

- **Extension side:** `buildUninstallUrl` (`src/utils.js`, unit-tested) + a
  `refreshUninstallUrl` / `recordInstallDate` pair in **both** `background.js`
  (not shared — fix bugs in both, §6). The URL carries `l` language, `v` version,
  `b` browser, `i` install date (`YYYY-MM-DD`), `ie=1` when that date was only
  inferred at update time, `o` popup opens and `s` conversations saved (both from
  `usageStats`, `storage.local`), **all in the URL fragment (`#`), never the query
  string**. The browser opens this page unprompted, so anything in the query would
  already be in the request line — in the host's logs and leaked onward via
  `Referer` — before the user consented. Fragments are never sent to a server,
  which is exactly what makes `privacyBody`'s "Nothing leaves your device until you
  press Send" literally true, and keeps `s1UninstallBody`'s "its address carries
  six non-identifying details" true as well. **Never move these back to `?`.**
  `docs/site/uninstall.js` reads the fragment and falls back to the query, because
  `setUninstallURL` captured its value long before the page opens and an extension
  that has not run since the switch still holds a `?` URL; drop the fallback once
  that has aged out. The *date* is sent, never a day count —
  `setUninstallURL` is called long before the page opens, so a count would be
  stale; the page derives the tenure. The URL is re-signed on install/startup
  **and on every `usageStats` change**, so both counters stay current.
  `s` is the one that makes `o` interpretable: opens alone cannot separate "opened
  the popup four times and saved nothing" from "actually used it".
- **Both privacy strings enumerate the params exhaustively** — `privacyBody` in
  `docs/site/uninstall-i18n.js` and `s1UninstallBody` in `docs/site/privacy-i18n.js`
  ("six non-identifying details"). Adding a param means updating both, in all 43
  languages, or the disclosure becomes false.
- **Page side:** `docs/uninstall-{ai,gemini}-folders.html` → `site/uninstall.js`
  (+ `uninstall-i18n.js`, 43 languages, and `styles.css`'s `.uf-*` block). It
  reuses `AF_LANGS` / `AF_RTL` / `AF_SCRIPT_FONT` from `i18n-manual.js` and the
  `LOGOS.geminiFolders` mark; `app.js` and `i18n-data.js` are **not** loaded.
- **`docs/site/uninstall-forms.js` is the only file to touch when the Forms are
  (re)created** — form ids + one `entry.<N>` per question, obtained from the
  Form's "Get pre-filled link". While the ids are still `PASTE_…`, the page warns
  in the console and shows the user a normal thank-you.
- **The Form is the schema.** Its checkbox options must be exactly
  `not-what-expected`, `dont-understand-how`, `wanted-in-page-ui`, `found-bugs`,
  `no-longer-needed`, `found-alternative`, `other` — the English keys, never the
  translated labels. Google silently drops a
  response carrying an unknown option, and translated values would make the
  response sheet unreadable. No question may be *required*, and "Collect email
  addresses" must be OFF.
  **Order of operations when adding a reason or a field: update both Forms FIRST,
  then ship the page.** `no-longer-needed` / `found-alternative` were added because
  26% of the first 43 GF responses arrived with nothing checked and 5 of the 6
  `other` boxes were left empty — the list was missing their reason.
- **The GF Form carries an eighth option, `switched-to-ai-folders`**, shown first on
  the Gemini Folders page only (leaving for AI Folders is an upgrade, not a
  grievance, and mixing it into the complaints would misread the numbers). Its
  label names the *other* product — `SWITCH_REASON.afName` in `uninstall.js`
  resolves `{p}` to the AF name even on the GF page. The AF page never sends this
  value, so the AF Form must not offer it.
- **Nothing is transmitted on page load** — the browser opens that URL without the
  user asking, so only an explicit Send posts anything. Disclosed in the privacy
  policy (`s1UninstallTitle` / `s1UninstallBody`, 43 languages) and in a note on
  the page itself. Don't add anything that fires on load.
- **Both pages are `noindex`, absent from `sitemap.xml`, and linked from nowhere.**
  Do **not** add a `Disallow` to `robots.txt`: a disallowed URL can still be
  indexed URL-only, whereas a crawlable `noindex` is honoured (GitHub Pages cannot
  send `X-Robots-Tag`).

## 10. First-run welcome page

Opened in a tab **once, on fresh install only**, by `openWelcomeTab(details.reason)`
in **both** `background.js` (not shared, §6 — `reason === 'install'`, never `update`
or `onStartup`).

**Why it exists — don't remove it without new data.** The first 43 Gemini Folders
uninstall responses (27/07 → 07/08/2026, a 44% response rate against 97 CWS
uninstalls, so representative) said the churn is in the first minute, not in the
features: 77% uninstalled the same day, median 2 popup opens, and **23% had `o=0` —
they never opened the popup at all**. Chrome hides a new extension behind the puzzle
icon, so after installing, nothing on screen changes. Hence step 1 is "pin it", not
a feature tour. Baselines to measure against are in §11.

**Firefox needs step 1 too — do not remove it there.** Since Firefox 109 (Jan 2023)
Firefox has its own unified Extensions panel and a newly installed extension lands
*in the panel*, not on the toolbar, exactly like Chrome; the extensions that don't
appear in that panel are precisely the pinned ones. Only the gesture differs, so
`welcome.js` swaps `welcomePinBody` for `welcomePinBodyFirefox` on a `/Firefox/`
user-agent (same test as `background.js`). That string quotes Firefox's **own**
"Pin to Toolbar" label, taken from `mozilla-l10n/firefox-l10n`
(`browser/browser/unifiedExtensions.ftl`, key
`unified-extensions-context-menu-pin-to-toolbar`) so the page names the menu entry
the user actually sees. Five locales (et, hi, lt, ms, sw) have that file without the
key, so Firefox falls back to en-US there — quoting the English label is correct for
them, not a gap. Serbian is the Latin transliteration of Firefox's Cyrillic label
(§6 / `tests/serbian-latin.test.js`). The step-1 artwork stays puzzle → pin in both
browsers — the pin is the *outcome*, which is what the step title promises — but the
**puzzle glyph itself is per-browser**: `.ico-chrome` (Material Symbols `extension`,
filled) and `.ico-firefox` (Firefox's outline puzzle, stroked) both ship in the HTML
and `pickExtensionsGlyph()` removes the one that does not apply. Exactly one must
survive or they stack inside the same 38px tile. The outline needs `fill: none` **and**
its `stroke-width` declared in `welcome.css`: presentation attributes on the markup
lose to any CSS rule, so `.glyph svg { fill }` would otherwise flood the shape.

- **`src/welcome.html` + `welcome.js` + `welcome.css` are shared** by both
  extensions. Every string comes from `chrome.i18n`, so the Gemini-vs-18-sites
  wording lives in each extension's own `_locales`. Seven of the eight keys are
  deliberately **product-neutral and byte-identical** between AF and GF; only
  `welcomeOpenBody` differs. `tests/welcome.test.js` enforces both halves of that.
  The product name is not a new key — the page reuses `appTitle`.
- **It is styled after aifolders.xyz, not after the popup** (brand row → big `h1` →
  translucent cards → violet accent → `.btn-primary`), so the extension's own tab
  reads like the privacy and uninstall pages the same user may see later.
  `welcome.css` copies the tokens from `docs/site/styles.css`; keep them in step.
  Two deliberate departures:
  - **Dark only.** The site has no light theme, so matching it means not having one.
    Don't "fix" this by adding a light palette — that would stop matching the site.
  - **No web font.** The site pulls Schibsted Grotesk + a dozen Noto subsets from
    Google Fonts. This page must stay inert, so it keeps the site's stack minus the
    hosted font and falls back to `system-ui`. Vendoring the woff2 would cost
    ~80 KB × 2 extensions (latin + latin-ext, both needed for the 43 locales) — a
    deliberate open question, not an oversight.
  It does **not** import `popup.css`: that pins `body { width: 392px;
  max-height: 576px }` and `html { overflow-y: hidden }`, which a full tab must not
  inherit, and the block is explicitly fragile (§6).
- **The three illustrations are real UI, not schematics.** Step 1 shows Chrome's own
  toolbar glyphs — Material `extension` (the puzzle button) then Material `push_pin`
  — because those two icons *are* the instruction. Step 2 shows the supported sites'
  logos, built by `welcome.js` from each extension's `site-config.js`: `SITES`
  entries that have a `domain` (AF), or Gemini alone when there is no registry (GF,
  which therefore also ships `icons/gemini.png`). Entries without a domain — the
  user-configured local LLM — are left out of a row that says "open a conversation
  on one of these". Step 3 is a CSS replica of the popup's own add-conversation
  button, localized, so it is recognizable once the popup opens.
- **The replica copies the popup button's *computed* values, not its source.**
  `popup.css` declares a `.main-btn` block inside its `prefers-color-scheme: dark`
  media query (translucent blue, 1px border, blue glow) that the plain `.main-btn`
  rule further down overrides at equal specificity — so **none of that dark block
  ever applies**, and transcribing it would have produced a button no user sees.
  Read the values out of the browser if you touch this. (The dead block is a real
  popup.css wart; cleaning it belongs with the §8 CSS cleanup, not here.)
  A test pins the replica to the popup's dark `--accent-color` / `--shadow-sm` so a
  restyle of the popup fails loudly instead of drifting.
- **Step 3's text quotes the popup's Save button through a `{b}` placeholder**, which
  `welcome.js` fills with this locale's `saveBtn`. Never hardcode the button name
  into a translation: the substitution is what stops the instruction from naming a
  button the popup does not have. A test asserts all 43 × 2 keep the placeholder.
- **The page is inert**: no network, no storage writes, no "welcome seen" flag. It
  opens unprompted, so anything that fired on load would look like a phone-home —
  the same rule as the uninstall page (§9). A test asserts this.
- No `manifest.json` entry is needed: the build copies the whole `src/` tree, and an
  extension page opened via `chrome.runtime.getURL` needs no
  `web_accessible_resources`.

### 10b. What's-new page (`src/whats-new.html` + `whats-new.js`)

Same shell, same stylesheet (`welcome.css`), same rules as §10 — shared by both
extensions, every string from `chrome.i18n`, dark-only, inert. It reuses `appTitle`
and `welcomeCta` rather than adding keys, and shows the installed version from
`chrome.runtime.getManifest()` so the chip can never disagree with reality.

- **Opened on update, gated on a constant**: `WHATS_NEW_VERSION` in *each*
  `background.js` (not shared, §6). The page opens only when
  `reason === 'update'` **and** the manifest version equals that constant, so a
  minor release with nothing to explain simply leaves the constant alone. A test
  asserts the constant equals the manifest version, or the next release would
  reopen notes that no longer describe it.
- **`whatsNewSeenFor` (storage.local) is not redundant** with that check: reloading
  an unpacked extension also fires `onInstalled` with `reason === 'update'`, which
  would reopen the tab on every dev cycle, and so would reinstalling over the same
  version. This is the one deliberate difference from the welcome page, which needs
  no flag because a fresh install happens once.
- **The Baidu card is AI Folders only, decided by the site registry** (`SITES.baidu`),
  not by a per-product flag — the same data-driven detection `welcome.js` uses to
  fall back to Gemini alone. Its two strings therefore live in **AF's `_locales`
  only**: a string Gemini Folders can never show would be dead weight in 43 files.
- **`{k}` in `whatsNewReuseBody`** is filled by `currentModifierKeyLabel()`, which
  moved from `folders.js` to `utils.js` for this page (folders.js re-exports it, so
  its tests are unchanged). Never hardcode `Cmd` or `Ctrl` into a translation — a
  test rejects both words in all 43 × 2.
- **The cards are features, not steps**: `.cards` switches off `welcome.css`'s
  counter markers. Numbering them would read as instructions to follow.

## 11. Baselines for the 2026-08 anti-churn work

Frozen 06/08/2026 over 30 days (08/07 → 06/08), so the welcome page and the survey
changes can be judged on a comparable window. Re-measure ~30 days after release.

| Metric | Source | GF | AF |
|---|---|---|---|
| Installs | CWS | 674 (22.5/day) | 113 (3.8/day) |
| Uninstalls | CWS | 318 (10.6/day) | 40 (1.3/day) |
| **Churn** | CWS | **47%** | 35% |
| Net | CWS | +356 | +73 |
| Share with `opens=0` | survey | **23%** | 1/7 |
| `dont-understand-how` | survey | 12% | 1/7 |
| Uninstalled same day | survey | 77% | 7/7 |

Reading cautions:

- GF churn was **already** falling before any change (52% → 42% between the two
  fortnights). Don't claim that slope: compare GF's movement against AF's over the
  same window, AF being a rough control (same code, same release, different audience).
- AF is too small (40 uninstalls/month) for a change there to mean anything. Conclude
  on GF; on AF only check for the absence of a regression.
- **2026-07-30 reads 0 installs / 0 uninstalls on both extensions** — a CWS reporting
  gap, not a real day. Exclude it from any daily average.
- **`s` is discontinuous from the tab-reuse release onward.** Until then, saving a
  conversation that was already in the folder still wrote and still incremented
  the counter, so older `s` values are inflated by re-saves. The number is now
  right, but **do not compare averages across that boundary**.
- Once `s` (§9) has data, the decisive question becomes readable: among those who
  leave with `saves > 0` (they did use it), what share ask for `wanted-in-page-ui`?
  That number — not today's n=4 — decides whether the in-page UI is worth building
  (§8's deferred item).
