# AGENTS

Notes for agents (and humans operating as agents) working on this repo.

## What this is

llama-dash is a dashboard UI plus a logging, auth-ready proxy for a local
inference backend. The implemented backend is currently
[llama-swap](https://github.com/mostlygeek/llama-swap), fronting llama.cpp
models through its `/v1/*` OpenAI/Anthropic-compatible endpoint. Feature ideas
and prioritization live in [`next-plan.md`](./next-plan.md).

Short version of goals:

- Single-pane dashboard for a self-hosted llama-swap stack.
- Add proxy features llama-swap doesn't have: API keys, quotas, filters, logging.
- Model lifecycle (load / unload / configure / hot-reload) driven from the UI.
- Keep inference backend integration capability-driven so future runtimes like
  Ollama can be added without weakening the llama-swap/GGUF path.
- Eventually shipped as a Docker Compose stack; llama-swap hidden internally.

Short version of non-goals:

- We do not run inference. That's the selected inference backend, currently
  llama-swap + llama.cpp.
- Not a multi-tenant SaaS. Single team, single box.
- No distributed deployment.

## Architecture

```
client ──► llama-dash :8080 ──► inference backend ──► model server procs
           │
           ├─ UI (/)
           ├─ Admin API (/api/*)
           └─ Proxy (/v1/*)  ← also what clients hit
```

One public port. The inference backend is not exposed on the host in the bundled
compose setup. The proxy layer is where auth, ACL, rate-limiting,
policies/filters, and logging all hang off.

Keep the proxy layer isolated in `src/server/proxy/*` and the admin surface
in `src/server/admin/*`. Don't merge them — they have different evolution
paths (proxy will grow middleware; admin will grow CRUD).

## What's shipped

1. TanStack Start app on `:5173`.
2. SQLite (`data/dash.db`) + Drizzle. Runtime tables plus query indexes for common
   request/model-event lookups: `requests` (per-call
   metadata + optional bodies/headers), `model_events` (load/unload
   event-sourced timeline), `api_keys` (hashed keys + rate limits + ACLs +
   system prompt + MCP relay allow-lists), `model_aliases` (global model name mapping),
   `routing_rules` (ordered request routing rules), `upstream_credentials`
   (encrypted direct-upstream bearer credentials), `mcp_relays` (configured
   MCP reverse proxies with credential bindings), `settings` (key-value
   config like request limits and attribution header mapping), and Better Auth's
   `user`, `session`, `account`, and `verification` tables for dashboard sessions.
3. `/v1/*` pass-through proxy that streams SSE unchanged and queues one log row
   per completed request with token counts pulled from the final SSE `usage` chunk (or
   the JSON `usage` field for non-streamed responses). `handler.ts` owns the
   high-level flow, `context.ts` owns request-scoped proxy state transitions,
   `body.ts` owns request body snapshots/forward bodies/logged bodies/content-length
   updates, `forward.ts` owns upstream fetch, streaming, usage scanning,
   completion/disconnect log enqueueing, and TPM recording, and `log.ts` owns the
   bounded async SQLite write queue.
   Request cost estimates use a startup-cached `models.dev` pricing catalog;
   unknown or unavailable pricing records produce `null` cost rather than a
   guessed value. Handles both OpenAI (`/v1/chat/completions`, flat
   `usage.prompt_tokens`/`completion_tokens`) and Anthropic (`/v1/messages`,
   `/v1/messages/count_tokens`, nested `message.usage` with
   `input_tokens`/`output_tokens`, `message_stop` stream terminator) shapes.
4. Inference backend facade (`src/server/inference/*`). The selected singleton
   backend currently supports `llama-swap` only and normalizes model list,
   running-model state, health, proxy upstream selection, lifecycle actions,
   logs, config snippets, config-derived context hints, model capability metadata,
   and model log-name hints.
   Backend support is capability-driven; unsupported operations should return a
   structured `501` and UI routes should hide links or show direct-navigation
   fallbacks. See [`docs/2026_05_03_inference_backends.md`](./docs/2026_05_03_inference_backends.md).
5. Admin API:
   Dashboard auth, when enabled, gates all `/api/*` routes below except `/api/auth/*`.
   `/api/auth/*` is handled by Better Auth for first-user signup, username/password and passkey sign-in, session lookup, and sign-out.
   - `/api/models` — list models (merged with running state + peer info)
   - `/api/models/:id` — model detail (stats, events, recent requests, config snippet, key breakdown)
   - `/api/models/:id/load`, `/api/models/:id/unload`, `/api/models/unload`
   - `/api/requests` — cursor-paginated list
   - `/api/requests/stats` — req/s, tok/s, p50, error rate + sparklines
   - `/api/requests/histogram` — bucketed req/s histogram
   - `/api/requests/:id` — detail with adjacent navigation
   - `/api/health` — upstream reachability, version, latency
    - `/api/model-timeline` — load/unload events for timeline viz
    - `/api/events` — lightweight llama-dash dashboard invalidation/data events
    - `/api/log-events` — llama-swap log SSE stream used only by the Logs page
   - `/api/gpu` — cached GPU stats (VRAM, utilization, temp, power)
   - `/api/system` — runtime, update status, DB, proxy, log queue, and poller status with GPU device details
   - `/api/system/request-logs/prune`, `/api/system/database/compact` — manual request-log retention and SQLite compaction actions
   - `/api/playground/article-extract` — fetch and Readability-parse an article URL into clean text for Speech playground TTS
   - `/api/config` — read/save llama-swap config with schema validation enforced before writes
   - `/api/config/validate` — validate config content against llama-swap's published JSON schema
   - `/api/keys` — CRUD for API keys (create, list, revoke, delete)
   - `/api/keys/:id` — key detail (stats, model breakdown, recent requests); PATCH accepts `name`, `allowedModels`, `allowedMcpRelays`, `systemPrompt`
    - `/api/aliases` — CRUD for model aliases (global model name mapping)
    - `/api/routing-rules` — CRUD + reorder for ordered routing rules
    - `/api/upstream-credentials` — encrypted bearer credential vault for direct upstream routing and MCP relays
    - `/api/mcp-relays` — CRUD for configured remote MCP relay endpoints
    - `/api/settings/attribution` — GET/PATCH header mappings for client/end-user/session capture
   - `/api/settings/request-limits` — GET/PATCH global request size limits
6. `/metrics` — Prometheus text exporter with low-cardinality request, token,
   credential injection success/failure, latency-window, queue, upstream,
   running-model, and GPU metrics.
7. GPU poller: auto-detects NVIDIA (`nvidia-smi`), AMD (`rocm-smi`), or
   Apple Silicon (`system_profiler`). Polls every 10s (static-only for
   Apple), caches snapshots, and publishes GPU-change dashboard events. AMD uses GTT memory (not BIOS-limited VRAM) for APUs.
8. Model watcher: polls the selected backend's running-model capability every
   15s, diffs against known state, inserts `load`/`unload` events into SQLite,
   and publishes model-change dashboard events.
9. UI views: Login (Better Auth username/password + passkey form), Dashboard (stats, timeline, running models, upstream+GPU,
    recent requests), Models (list + load/unload + capability badges + per-model detail),
    Requests (filtered/sorted log + histogram + detail), Logs, System (runtime,
    update status, DB, proxy, queue, and GPU poller/device status), Playground
    (chat plus request/response/timing/events/curl inspector tabs; speech TTS
    with plain text or paragraph-chunked server-extracted article URLs and waveform playback;
    image and transcription testing; timing sidebar shows TTFT, prefill,
    decode, and stream-close when upstream llama.cpp timing metadata is present), Config editor with explicit
    validate action plus pre-save schema validation, Settings (appearance controls
    and global proxy/privacy/retention defaults), API Keys (list +
    per-key detail), Attribution (header mapping + client setup examples),
    Policies (request limits + persisted routing rule editor with rewrite,
    reject, auth passthrough, direct upstream target controls, credential vault
    with dependency warnings, and MCP relay management with Claude Code snippets), Endpoints (connection examples for curl, Python, TS,
    Home Assistant, Claude Code, opencode, Continue, Open WebUI).
10. API key auth + rate limiting. Keys are SHA-256 hashed at rest,
   shown once on creation. When keys exist in DB, proxy requires
   `Authorization: Bearer sk-...`. Per-key RPM/TPM token-bucket rate
   limiting (in-memory, resets on restart). Per-key model allow-lists and MCP relay allow-lists.
   Routing rules can explicitly opt into `passthrough` auth, which skips
   llama-dash key enforcement for matching requests and can preserve the
   client's `Authorization` header for upstream OAuth/API-key validation.
   Routing rules can also target a configured direct HTTPS `/v1` upstream,
   bypassing llama-swap for that matched request while keeping proxy logging.
   Direct targets can reference encrypted upstream bearer credentials; the
   admin API never returns secret values, and the proxy injects the credential
   immediately before forwarding. Routing rules can also bind encrypted
   credentials to outbound headers either by setting the header automatically
   or replacing a namespaced `{{llama-dash:credential:<slug>}}` placeholder;
    injected values are redacted in request logs and recorded as credential
    injection metadata with non-secret credential name/slug labels. Stored
   credentials require `CREDENTIAL_ENCRYPTION_KEY` to be set to a 32+ character value.
   Passthrough routing rules can use stored credentials, but credential-bearing
   rules are never evaluated before llama-dash key auth; callers must present a
   valid llama-dash API key before any stored credential is injected.
   MCP relays live at `/mcp-relays/:slug`; they require `x-llama-dash-api-key`
   and the key must explicitly allow that relay so the client's `Authorization`
   header can be owned by the upstream provider credential injection.
   Anthropic/Claude Code passthrough is configured explicitly with routing rules,
   typically matching `/v1/messages` and `/v1/messages/count_tokens` with
   `continue` + `passthrough` auth and preserved client `Authorization`.
11. Proxy transform pipeline (`src/server/proxy/transforms.ts`). Intercepts
   POST `/v1/*` requests between auth and forwarding. Parses body once when
   needed, applies transforms in order, re-serializes only if mutated:
   allow-list check → routing rule evaluation → alias resolution → system
   prompt injection → request size limits. Routing rules are ordered,
   first-match-wins, and currently support `continue`, `rewrite_model`, `reject`, and
   per-rule auth mode (`require_key` or `passthrough`). Pre-auth passthrough
   routing only evaluates passthrough rules without API-key matchers. Normal
   key-auth requests authenticate before body parsing unless an enabled
   pre-auth passthrough rule needs body-derived fields (`requestedModels`,
   `stream`, or estimated prompt token bounds). Endpoint-only passthrough rules
   can match before auth without consuming the request body.
   In-memory caches for aliases and settings, invalidated on admin writes.
   System-prompt injection branches
   by endpoint: `/v1/chat/completions` prepends a `system` message to
   `messages[]`; `/v1/messages` prepends to the top-level `system` field
   (string or content-block array, preserved shape).
12. Request logs persist routing and attribution context. Request detail shows
      matched routing rule/action/auth mode plus client, end-user, and session metadata.
    Request list supports routing, attribution, and client-host filters, and session IDs
    deep-link back into the filtered request log. Request/response body capture is
    bounded, with full recent bodies kept only in a byte-budget in-memory LRU.
    Request rows are classified as `inference` or `mcp_relay`; successful MCP relay
    rows are metadata-only by default, while relay failures keep bounded body/header
    snippets for debugging. Hourly retention pruning removes old inference rows,
    short-lived successful relay rows, longer-lived relay failures, and stale body/header
    text. The Settings page also exposes immediate prune and SQLite compaction actions.
13. Admin JSON GET responses support conditional ETag polling. The admin dispatcher
    hashes successful JSON bodies, returns `304` for matching `If-None-Match`,
    and the client fetch helper reuses the cached parsed payload for unchanged
    dashboard polls. Dashboard shells also keep `/api/events` open for SSE-driven
    query updates on request completion, model state changes, GPU changes, and
    system update status changes. Request completion events include compact
    request summaries so list/recent caches update without refetching models.
    The raw llama-swap log stream is split onto `/api/log-events` and is only
    subscribed while the Logs page is mounted.
14. System update checks use the GitHub `main` branch head commit with a short in-memory cache and
    surface current/available/error state in the System runtime panel.
15. Feature-local UI structure under `src/features/*`. Route files are thin
    entrypoints; page-specific components live with their feature instead of
    accumulating inside `src/routes/*` or flat shared component files.

## Tooling

- **Lint + format**: [Biome](https://biomejs.dev) (replaces ESLint + Prettier).
  Config matches the old Prettier style: 2-space indent, single quotes, no
  semicolons, trailing commas. `src/styles.css` is excluded because Biome's
  CSS parser rejects Tailwind v4 directives (`@plugin`, `@theme`).
- **Typecheck**: [tsgo](https://github.com/microsoft/typescript-go) via
  `@typescript/native-preview`. It's faster than `tsc` and is the default
  typechecker for this repo. Don't add `tsc` back. Note: tsgo rejects
  `baseUrl` in tsconfig — use `paths` with root-relative entries.
- **Package manager**: pnpm only. Don't commit `npm`/`yarn` lockfiles.
- **ORM**: Drizzle (`drizzle-orm` + `drizzle-kit`) over better-sqlite3.
  Migrations live in `drizzle/`. Generate with `pnpm db:generate`, apply
  with `pnpm db:migrate`.
- **Runtime validation**: [Valibot](https://valibot.dev) for runtime type
  validation at trust boundaries. Schemas live in `src/lib/schemas/` (shared
  API types) and `src/server/llama-swap/schemas.ts` (upstream response
  shapes). Types are derived from schemas via `v.InferOutput` — never
  hand-write a type that duplicates a schema. Use `v.parse()` where failure
  should throw (fetch wrappers) and `v.safeParse()` where you need to
  return a structured error (request body validation).
- **React framework**: TanStack Start (file-based router + Nitro under the
  hood). Server functions via `createServerFn` are available but we haven't
  leaned on them yet; UI data fetching goes client-side against `/api/*`.

## Styling

- **Tailwind v4** is the primary styling tool. Prefer Tailwind utility
  classes inline in JSX wherever practical over adding new rules to
  `src/styles.css`.
- Existing component classes in `styles.css` (`.btn`, `.dtable`, `.panel`,
  `.stat-card`, etc.) are fine to use when they are genuinely shared,
  especially if they are defined via `@apply`. Don't add new feature-local
  CSS classes in `styles.css` for layout/styling that can reasonably live in
  the component.
- Prefer this order:
  1. Inline Tailwind utilities in JSX for page/layout/component styling
  2. Small shared semantic classes in `@layer components` using `@apply`
  3. Plain CSS only for things that are awkward or noisy in utilities
     (syntax highlighting, editor overlays, markdown prose rules, complex
     pseudo-elements, scrollbars, keyframes, visualization widgets)
- Keep `src/styles.css` as a support layer, not the primary place for page
  styling. It should mostly contain:
  - theme tokens and root variables
  - shared `@apply` primitives (`.btn`, `.panel`, `.dtable`, etc.)
  - animations and keyframes
  - syntax-highlighting/editor/widget rules that are better expressed in CSS
- Theme tokens are mapped in the `@theme` block at the top of `styles.css`
  (e.g. `--color-fg`, `--color-surface-1`, `--color-accent`). Use the
  corresponding Tailwind classes (`text-fg`, `bg-surface-1`, `border-accent`)
  instead of raw `var(--fg)` in inline styles.
- Animation tokens (`--duration-normal`, `--ease-out`, etc.) live in `:root`.
  Use them via arbitrary values when needed (`transition-[border-color_var(--duration-micro)_ease]`),
  or keep short transitions in `styles.css` if the arbitrary syntax gets unwieldy.
- **Conditional classnames**: use the `cn()` helper from `src/lib/cn.ts`
  for composing classnames conditionally. Prefer `cn('foo', condition && 'bar')`
  over template literals or string concatenation.

### UI polish guide

- Use `rounded` for input-like controls and inner stat/detail cards. Reserve
  `rounded-sm` for tiny badges, chips, and compact inline pills. Full-width
  integrated page sections may stay square via `!rounded-none`.
- Prefer shared copy affordances: `CopyableCode` for inline/input-like copied
  values, `CodeBlock` for multiline examples. Do not add feature-local copy
  buttons unless the shared components cannot fit.
- Use the app `Tooltip` component for explanatory hover/focus hints. Avoid
  browser `title` tooltips except where a third-party component requires it.
- Keep micro-interactions subtle: short color transitions, `ease-out` for
  user-triggered feedback, `ease-in-out` for in-place movement, and very small
  active scale on larger controls.
- Match adjacent control height, radius, border, and surface color before adding
  new variants. Tiny mismatches are visible in dense admin pages.

## Refactor Learnings

- **Thin routes, feature-local UI.** Route files should stay thin entrypoints.
  Route-owned components and helpers belong in `src/features/<feature>/`, not
  back in `src/routes/*` or flat shared component files.
- **One component per file is the default.** If a file grows because it owns
  multiple embedded subcomponents, split it. Shared helpers can stay local to
  the feature.
- **Be careful with full-height layouts.** The biggest regression class during
  the Tailwind migration was losing `min-h-0` / `flex-1` / `h-full` behavior
  in nested grid/flex containers. On dashboard, requests, logs, and detail
  pages, always verify that the main content column actually stretches to the
  bottom and that scrollable regions still own the overflow.
- **Be careful with column dividers.** If a vertical border is meant to span a
  whole column, prefer putting it on the parent column container rather than a
  child panel whose height may not match adjacent content.
- **Preserve mono typography intentionally.** Another regression class during
  the styling refactor was losing the old dashboard/request sidebar feel when
  mono/text-dim styles were removed with old CSS classes. Labels, metrics,
  timestamps, IDs, and control chrome often intentionally use `font-mono`.
- **Hydration stability matters.** `TopBar` previously hydrated poorly because
  SSR rendered time/query-driven values that changed immediately on the client.
  For clocks and live operational readouts, prefer stable SSR placeholders and
  render live values only after mount.
- **Use browser verification for layout changes.** After meaningful styling or
  layout work, verify the actual rendered UI on the running dev server. Static
  checks alone won't catch full-height regressions, divider placement issues,
  or typography drift.

## Dependency version policy

- No `"latest"` in `package.json` — pin ranges (`^x.y.z`) to versions that
  are resolved and published. The user has a global pnpm
  `minimumReleaseAge` policy (>24h); installs will fail on freshly
  published versions. Pick a version that satisfies it rather than bypassing.

## Entity IDs

All entity primary keys are **prefixed ULIDs** stored as `text` in SQLite.
Format: `{prefix}_{ulid}`, e.g. `req_01J5A3KWGF9QXRZ0N1BVCH6YPM`.

| Entity      | Prefix |
| ----------- | ------ |
| Request     | `req`  |
| ModelEvent  | `mev`  |
| ApiKey      | `key`  |
| ModelAlias  | `mal`  |
| McpRelay    | `mrl`  |

When adding a new table, pick a short (2–4 char) lowercase prefix, add it
to the table above, and generate the ID at insert time via `ulidx`:

```ts
import { ulid } from 'ulidx'
const id = `pfx_${ulid()}`
```

IDs are strings everywhere — schema, API types, route params, query keys.
Never `Number()` them. Cursor-based pagination uses the ID directly (ULIDs
sort lexicographically by creation time).

## Dev environment

- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set `INFERENCE_BASE_URL` to point at your
  llama-swap instance. Default is `http://localhost:8080`.
- If your upstream uses HTTPS with a self-signed cert, set
  `INFERENCE_INSECURE=true` so Node accepts it (it sets
  `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0` at boot). Off by default.
- The proxy forward fetch uses a dedicated undici dispatcher (not global) so
  long non-streaming upstream jobs (image gen) don't trip undici's 300s default
  `headersTimeout` and get mislabeled `upstream_unreachable`. Tune via
  `UPSTREAM_HEADERS_TIMEOUT_MS` (default 600000) and `UPSTREAM_BODY_TIMEOUT_MS`
  (default 0); `0` disables.
- Env vars consumed by the server live in `src/server/config.ts`. Add new
  ones there, not ad-hoc across the codebase.

## Runtime validation conventions

- **Validate at trust boundaries.** Every response from an external source
  (llama-swap API, GPU CLI tools, client HTTP request bodies) must be
  validated with a valibot schema. Internal data flow (e.g. DB → API
  response) can rely on TypeScript types derived from the same schemas.
- **Schemas are the single source of truth for API types.** Don't define a
  type by hand if a schema already describes that shape — use
  `v.InferOutput<typeof SomeSchema>`. If you need a new API type, write
  the schema first, derive the type from it.
- **Where schemas live:** shared API contract shapes go in
  `src/lib/schemas/`. Server-only upstream shapes (llama-swap responses)
  go in `src/server/llama-swap/schemas.ts`. If a new external integration
  is added, give it its own schema file near the client code.
- **Adding a new endpoint:** define request/response schemas in
  `src/lib/schemas/`, use `v.parse()` in the client-side `api.ts` fetch
  wrapper, and `v.safeParse()` for server-side request body validation in
  the admin handler.

## Design constraints worth keeping in mind

- **Request bodies are not logged.** Ever, in this first pass. If that
  changes it will be a deliberate opt-in feature, not a side-effect of
  another change. Privacy matters; prompts are sensitive.
- **Proxy body state belongs in `src/server/proxy/body.ts`.** Do not spread
  ad-hoc body variables through `handler.ts`. Use the body snapshot helpers for
  parsed routing input, transformed JSON serialization, multipart model updates,
  forward body selection, logged body selection, and `content-length` updates.
- **Authenticate before body parsing when safe.** `handler.ts` should only read
  the body before auth when pre-auth passthrough routing can require body fields.
  Keep `preAuthRoutingNeedsBody()` and `hasBodyDependentPreAuthRoutingRule()` in
  sync with any new routing match fields.
- **Streaming correctness is non-negotiable.** SSE must pass through
  without buffering (`res.write(value)` as each chunk arrives, no gather-
  then-flush). Token counting happens on a `tee`d scan, not by reading the
  body end-to-end before forwarding.
- **Log on completion, not on start.** A `requests` row represents an
  exchange, not an attempt. If the client disconnects mid-stream we still
  enqueue the row from the `catch` path with whatever usage we scraped. The
  logging queue is bounded; if it fills, dropping logs is preferable to blocking
  proxy traffic.
- **Config round-tripping will matter later.** When the config editor
  lands, user comments and key order in `config.yaml` must survive a write.
  Don't pick a YAML library that doesn't round-trip.
- **Config reload is file-based.** llama-swap uses `-watch-config` with a
  stat-poll watcher to detect config changes and reload automatically. SIGHUP
  reload is also supported upstream, but llama-dash still relies on atomic file
  writes rather than a reload endpoint.

## llama-swap API surface we consume

- `POST /v1/*` — forward OpenAI / Anthropic calls unchanged (after our middleware)
- `GET /running` — which models are currently loaded
- `POST /models/unload` — unload a model
- `GET /upstream/:model_id/*` — proxy directly to a specific llama-server (useful for `/metrics`)
- `GET /logs/stream`, `/logs/stream/proxy`, `/logs/stream/upstream`, `/logs/stream/{model_id}` — SSE log streams
- `GET /health`
- `GET /v1/models` — OpenAI-format list including peers and v229 capability metadata
- Hot reload: editing `config.yaml` when llama-swap runs with `-watch-config` triggers the stat-poll watcher; SIGHUP reload is also supported by llama-swap.

**CLI flags**: `-config <path>`, `-listen <addr>` (default `:8080`), `-watch-config`, `-tls-cert-file`, `-tls-key-file`, `-version`.

**Signals**: `SIGINT` / `SIGTERM` with graceful shutdown of child processes. `SIGHUP` reloads configuration.

## Claude Code / Anthropic passthrough

llama-dash fronts Anthropic's Messages API end-to-end. Point any Anthropic
SDK (including Claude Code) at llama-dash via `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` and the
proxy logs + forwards the call to `api.anthropic.com` through a llama-swap
`peers:` entry.

**Client config** (`~/.claude/settings.json`):

```json
{ "env": { "ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL": "http://<llama-dash>:5173" } }
```

Do not set `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` when using subscription OAuth — Claude Code
manages the bearer itself and llama-dash passes it through.

**llama-swap peer** (fragment of `config.yaml`):

```yaml
peers:
  anthropic:
    proxy: https://api.anthropic.com
    models:
      - claude-opus-4-7
      - claude-sonnet-4-6
      - claude-haiku-4-5-20251001
    # no apiKey — client Authorization header must pass through unchanged
```

**Proxy-layer specifics:**

- Explicit routing rules should match `/v1/messages` and `/v1/messages/count_tokens`,
  use `continue` + `passthrough` auth, and preserve the client `Authorization` header.
- Response content-encoding strip (`src/server/proxy/handler.ts` —
  `STRIP_RESPONSE_HEADERS`). Node's fetch auto-decompresses upstream bodies
  when consumed as a stream, so forwarding `content-encoding: gzip|br` would
  cause clients to double-decode (ZlibError in Claude Code). `content-length`
  goes with it since the decoded length differs.
- SSE usage scanner reads Anthropic's nested shapes: `message_start`'s
  `body.message.usage` / `body.message.model`, `message_delta`'s top-level
  `body.usage`. `message_stop` terminates the stream (no `[DONE]`).
- System-prompt injection on `/v1/messages` mutates top-level `body.system`
  (string or content-block array; shape preserved).

## Config contract

`config.yaml` is the interface between llama-dash and llama-swap. Rules:

- Atomic writes (write to `.tmp`, fsync, rename).
- Preserve user comments and key order (YAML round-tripper).
- Validate against llama-swap's `config-schema.json` before writing.
- Back up the previous version on every write.
- Keep `./config:/config` as a directory bind mount in bundled compose files;
  single-file mounts pin an inode and break atomic rename-over saves.
- llama-swap reloads `-watch-config` changes through stat polling; SIGHUP is an
  upstream escape hatch, not the normal llama-dash save path.

## Before you call work "done"

Always run — in this order — and make sure each command exits clean before
reporting a task complete:

```bash
pnpm lint:fix       # biome lint --write .
pnpm format:fix     # biome format --write .
pnpm typecheck      # tsgo --noEmit
```

If any of them emit errors that aren't auto-fixable, fix them before
reporting done. Do not suppress rules to make errors go away unless
there's a specific, commented reason.

**Do not start `pnpm dev` as a "final smoke test" before handing work back.**
The user runs the dev server themselves. Starting it leaves a background
process bound to :5173 and conflicts with their session. If a change
genuinely needs a running server to verify, start it in the middle of
your work, verify, and kill it — don't leave one running at the end.

## Keep docs in sync

After shipping a new feature or making major changes, update these three
files before calling the work done:

1. **`AGENTS.md`** — repo layout, "What's shipped" section, admin API list.
2. **`README.md`** — feature list, routes list, any user-facing changes.
3. Plans and documentation can be saved as markdown in the `docs/` directory

Notes saved under `docs/*.md` should use a date-prefixed filename in the
format `YYYY_MM_DD_descriptive_name.md`.

## Scope discipline

- MVP-first. Only implement what the current task asks for. No preemptive
  abstractions.
- For exploratory questions ("how should we do X?"), propose and wait.
  Don't land code until the approach is agreed.
- If a task touches both the proxy and the admin surface, think about
  whether it should be two commits.
