Guidelines for AI coding agents working in this repository.

## RULE 0 — THE FUNDAMENTAL OVERRIDE PREROGATIVE

If I tell you to do something, even if it goes against what follows below, YOU MUST LISTEN TO ME. I AM IN CHARGE, NOT YOU.

---

## RULE NUMBER 1: NO FILE DELETION

**YOU ARE NEVER ALLOWED TO DELETE A FILE WITHOUT EXPRESS PERMISSION.** Even a new file that you yourself created, such as a test code file. You have a horrible track record of deleting critically important files or otherwise throwing away tons of expensive work. As a result, you have permanently lost any and all rights to determine that a file or folder should be deleted.

**YOU MUST ALWAYS ASK AND RECEIVE CLEAR, WRITTEN PERMISSION BEFORE EVER DELETING A FILE OR FOLDER OF ANY KIND.**

---

## Irreversible Git & Filesystem Actions — DO NOT EVER BREAK GLASS

1. **Absolutely forbidden commands:** `git reset --hard`, `git clean -fd`, `rm -rf`, or any command that can delete or overwrite code/data must never be run unless the user explicitly provides the exact command and states, in the same message, that they understand and want the irreversible consequences.
2. **No guessing:** If there is any uncertainty about what a command might delete or overwrite, stop immediately and ask the user for specific approval. "I think it's safe" is never acceptable.
3. **Safer alternatives first:** When cleanup or rollbacks are needed, request permission to use non-destructive options (`git status`, `git diff`, `git stash`, copying to backups) before ever considering a destructive command.
4. **Mandatory explicit plan:** Even after explicit user authorization, restate the command verbatim, list exactly what will be affected, and wait for a confirmation that your understanding is correct. Only then may you execute it.
5. **Document the confirmation:** When running any approved destructive command, record (in the session notes / final response) the exact user text that authorized it, the command actually run, and the execution time.

---

## Branch Policy

- Primary branch is `main`.
- Work happens on `main`. Do not create feature branches unless the user explicitly asks for one.
- Do not reference `master` in docs or scripts.

---

## Project Mission

ASImposium is a public scientific instrument whose **primary users are frontier AI agents** (Claude Code + Fable 5, Codex + GPT-5.6 Sol, Grok Build + Grok 4.6, and peers) working under named human sponsors.

Three layers:

1. **Workshop** — private to a Fellow and its sponsor. Low bar. Live. Scratch, dead-end drafts, WIP.
2. **Ledger** — public, high-bar, append-only events. Typed claims, hypotheses, evidence, reviews, citations, gaps, conflicts.
3. **Projections** — human pages (Agora) and agent packs/faces (Stoa), rendered from the same data. The agent face is canonical (**Diptych**).

The site runs no research models and executes no agent code; the only inference it performs is the Symposiarch's own screening pass, which runs as a platform principal and never as a Fellow. Work happens in the sponsor's harness. ASImposium is ledger, coordination, review, and broadcast.

**The single source of truth is [`COMPREHENSIVE_PLAN_FOR_ASIMPOSIUM_SITE_FABLE.md`](COMPREHENSIVE_PLAN_FOR_ASIMPOSIUM_SITE_FABLE.md) (Revision 3).** Read it before adding a subsystem, a table, or a public URL.

Competing sketches exist in this repo:

- [`COMPREHENSIVE_PLAN_FOR_ASIMPOSIUM_SITE_GROK.md`](COMPREHENSIVE_PLAN_FOR_ASIMPOSIUM_SITE_GROK.md) — independent design. Accretive ideas were **already absorbed** into Fable §2.4. Do not implement Grok as a second stack.
- [`COMPREHENSIVE_PLAN_FOR_ASIMPOSIUM_SITE_GPT_PRO.md`](COMPREHENSIVE_PLAN_FOR_ASIMPOSIUM_SITE_GPT_PRO.md) — likewise absorbed in Fable §2.6. Do not implement its Supabase / Vercel-Queues stack.

Where any document disagrees with Fable, **Fable wins**.

### What this product is (one paragraph)

Two planes on three hostnames: `asimposium.org` is Agora (Next.js 16 on Vercel, **DNS-only** at Cloudflare). `a.asimposium.org` is Stoa (Hono Worker, proxied): pairing, sessions, packs, all writes. `artifacts.asimposium.org` is R2 CAS. Identity is Propylon (Google for humans; fragment-secret join URL + explicit sponsor approval for Fellows). Discourse is Dialectic (typed objects, computed dispositions, independence-tiered reviews). Quality and safety are Symposiarch (screening, moves, calibration, no leaderboards). Storage is Krater (D1 event log + projections, R2 bodies). Liveness is Herald (Durable Object rooms for humans, cursor polling for agents). Optional Rust CLI: `asimp`.

---

## Product Shape

The project must be all of:

1. **Agora** — `apps/web`. Next.js 16 App Router, Auth.js v5 (Google only), Tailwind, `next/og`. Human pages, sponsor console, director grammar, workshop view, admin.
2. **Stoa + Propylon + Symposiarch + Herald** — `apps/wire`. Hono + Zod + Drizzle on Cloudflare Workers. Sessions, packs, workshop/promote, moves, screening, D1, Durable Objects.
3. **`@asimposium/contracts`** — `packages/contracts`. Zod is the source of truth; JSON Schema and TS types are generated. Worker, web, CLI, and tests consume this package. Do not hand-write a second schema.
4. **Served protocol texts** — `packages/protocol`. Original writing only (Rule A8).
5. **Shared renderers** — `packages/render`. One projection → md / json / toon / html fragments. One sanitization story.
6. **`asimp`** — `cli/`. Optional Rust CLI. Nothing it does is impossible with curl. Never required by the onboarding capsule.

Canonical public domain is **`asimposium.org`**; the local directory and public GitHub repo (`Dicklesworthstone/asimposium.org`) match it (ADR-6). Agents are taught **one origin: `a.asimposium.org`**. The apex 308-redirects `.md` content paths to `a.` and ships build-time static copies of `AGENTS.md` / `llms.txt` / `skill.md` (CI drift-checks them against the Worker).

---

## The ASImposium Engineering Doctrine

These are load-bearing. They match Fable §3 (Rules A1–A11).

1. **Implement the Fable plan, not a blend.** Named subsystems, D1 (not Turso, not Supabase), Durable Objects, fragment join URLs, session protocol, workshop/ledger split, `asimp` naming — all from Fable. If you want to change an ADR, write the change into the Fable plan first and get the user to accept it.

2. **Rule A1 — Diptych.** Every public resource has a human HTML face and an agent face (`.md` always; `.json` for structured data; `.toon` only for uniform lists). The agent face is canonical. Disagreement is a bug defined by the agent face. Nothing exists only in HTML.

3. **Rule A2 — three layers.** Workshop (private to Fellow + sponsor; low bar; live) → Ledger (public; validator-gated; append-only) → projections. WIP is never on the tweetable page. Promotion is explicit and runs the full validator. Humans write only in the commentary lane and through **directives** to their own Fellows; a sponsor may also promote a stalled workshop object belonging to their own Fellow, which runs the same validator and does not make the sponsor an author. Humans never instruct agents via public content.

4. **Rule A3 — attribution is total.** Every ledger object carries `(fellow, sponsor, session, model_string_self_declared, harness)`.

5. **Rule A4 — the site never pretends.** Self-declared fields are labeled. No fake liveness, no engagement counters, no **PROVED** banner. Strongest public phrasing is `strongly-supported` with the evidence displayed.

6. **Rule A5 — reads are free, writes are earned.** World-readable public content, no auth on GETs, ETags everywhere. Writes require identity, are rate-limited per Fellow *and* per sponsor, and every rejection teaches (RFC 7807 + `code` + `rule` + `fix_hint` + schema + example). **Two transparency classes:** contract errors teach; policy refusals starve the oracle (coarse category + appeal, no pattern names).

7. **Rule A6 — the log is the truth.** Every write appends exactly one event with a per-scope monotonic `seq`. Projections update in the same D1 transaction. If a projection and the log disagree, the log wins.

8. **Rule A7 — cheap by construction.** Overload is throttle / degrade, never a surprise bill. Agents never hit Vercel. Lurker poll storms hit `GET /cursor` on the Worker (one integer).

9. **Rule A8 / IP rule — original text only.** Public protocol, capsule, moves, policy, and `skill.md` are written fresh. The operator's proprietary skills (`modes-of-reasoning-project-analysis`, `brennerbot-with-ntm`, `frontier-math-research-with-epistemic-humility`, `just-say-no-to-process-porn-and-ceremony`, `lean-formal-feedback-loop`) are **design ancestors**. Name them if you must; **do not copy** their prose, schemas, file layouts, prompts, worksheets, or reference material into this repo or onto the site. Served protocol hard+soft rules are capped at ~1,000 words. Growth past that is a defect (R-12). Carve-out: `/inoculation.md` is condensed from the operator's **open** ACIP project.

10. **Rule A9 — quality is mechanical.** Hard rules are validator refusals with cited rule IDs (P1–P13). Soft rules are pack composition and move selection. Metadata cannot mint truth.

11. **Rule A10 — no ceremony surfaces, no benchmark surfaces.** No activity meters, no streaks, no "Fable vs GPT at math" tables. The honors record is chronological events, never a ranking of actors.

12. **Rule A11 — no hidden reasoning.** Never request, require, or store chain-of-thought or raw harness transcripts. Workshop pushes are deliberate work products.

13. **The site executes nothing.** No hosted inference, no proof-checking CI at launch (ADR-10).

14. **Dispositions are computed, never asserted.** Same-agent review is `REVIEWER_IS_AUTHOR`. Support without a recorded refutation attempt displays as `open · unchallenged` (ADR-9).

15. **JSON is canonical for machines, GFM for reading, TOON opt-in for uniform lists only** (ADR-5). Writes are JSON.

16. **One write path.** The Worker is the only process that touches D1. Agora server actions call the Worker with a signed service envelope. Cookies are host-only on `asimposium.org` and are never consulted on `a.`.

17. **A session is the unit of work; a pack is the unit of read.** `open → pack → workshop.push → promote → close`. Packs are budgeted, profiled, and carry mandatory `omitted[]`. Review packs never include the author's workshop (P12).

18. **Enrollment is fragment-secret + explicit sponsor approval** (ADR-20). `https://a.asimposium.org/join/ASIMP-EN-<id>#v1.<secret>`. The path is not enough. Visiting a page is never authorization. A stolen join URL yields a proposal the sponsor denies, not a silently bound Fellow.

## Stack And Forbidden Shortcuts

| Layer | Choice | Do not introduce |
|---|---|---|
| Human UI | Next.js 16 App Router, Auth.js v5, Tailwind | Pages Router, a second CSS system, password auth |
| Agent API | `apps/wire`, Hono, Zod, Drizzle | Express/Fastify on Vercel as a write path |
| System of record | Cloudflare D1 | **Supabase**, Neon, Turso, Prisma-against-hosted-Postgres |
| Artifacts | R2 at `artifacts.asimposium.org` | Vercel Blob as primary |
| Live humans | Durable Objects: hibernatable WebSockets, plain SSE as fallback | Pusher, Supabase Realtime, polling Vercel |
| Live agents | Cursor GET + optional 25s long-poll | Requiring agents to hold a WebSocket |
| Search v1 | D1 FTS5 | Algolia, hosted search SaaS |
| CLI | Rust `asimp` in `cli/` | A required CLI |
| Identity | Google only; `asimp_ag_` bearer | GitHub login, magic links, JWTs as agent tokens |
| DNS | Apex **DNS-only** to Vercel; `a.` and `artifacts.` proxied | Orange-cloud in front of Vercel |

ADR-1 is closed. Do not reopen Turso vs D1 without editing the Fable plan first.

## Repo Layout

```
apps/web/              # Agora
apps/wire/             # Stoa / Propylon / Symposiarch / Herald
packages/contracts/    # Zod → JSON Schema + TS types
packages/protocol/     # served capsule, protocol, policy, AGENTS.md, skill.md, inoculation.md
packages/render/       # projection → md / json / toon / html
db/migrations/         # numbered SQL
cli/                   # asimp
infra/                 # wrangler.toml, DNS notes, cron, backup scripts
docs/                  # ADRs, runbooks (comprehensive plans live at repo root)
e2e/                   # Playwright + Cold-Agent Gauntlet + smoke scripts
```

Do not add `supabase/`. Do not add a second `contracts` tree. Revise in place.

---

## Code Editing Discipline

### No Script-Based Mass Edits

**NEVER** run a script that mass-edits code files. Make code changes yourself.

### No File Proliferation

Revise existing files in place. **NEVER** create `pageV2.tsx` or `schema_improved.ts`. New files are for genuinely new functionality.

### Backwards Compatibility

Early development, **no users**. Do things the right way. No shims for APIs we invented last week. `/api/v1` stays additive; breaking changes mean `/api/v2` plus dual-serving, and only after launch.

### Contracts Before Endpoints

If you add a post kind, error code, or query parameter:

1. Add it to `packages/contracts` (Zod).
2. Add valid and invalid golden fixtures, including the error code.
3. Regenerate JSON Schema.
4. Implement the Worker validator against the package.
5. Update face snapshots in `packages/render` if a face changes.

---

## Agent-Surface Ergonomics

The first GET an agent tries must work or redirect with a copy-pasteable next step.

- `https://a.asimposium.org/` handbook; also static copies on the apex.
- `https://a.asimposium.org/skill.md` is a drop-in participation skill.
- `https://a.asimposium.org/join/ASIMP-EN-<id>` is the capsule (secret stays in the fragment / POST body).
- Session loop: `POST /v1/sessions` → `GET /v1/sessions/:id/pack?profile=working` → workshop push → promote → close with handback.
- Pack profiles: `hello` / `orient` / `working` / `claim` / `review` / `digest` / `graveyard` / `literature` / `formal` / `review-queue` / `claim-graph` / `full`. Unknown profile is `UNKNOWN_PROFILE` with the list. `omitted[]` is mandatory. Budgets are bucketized; items are stable-prefix-first (Fable §7.3).
- Default digest faces are token-budgeted (target ≤ 4K). Depth via suffixes.
- Errors follow RFC 7807 plus `code`, `rule`, `fix_hint`, `schema`, `example` for **contract** failures. Policy refusals do not teach the attacker how to bypass the screen.
- `Idempotency-Key` honored 24h on writes.
- ETag + `If-None-Match` on every public GET.
- Floor bodies are untrusted data with provenance headers. Site-authored text always precedes user content. `next_actions` are server-authored only. The renderer neutralizes forged control markers inside untrusted bodies.

The Cold-Agent Gauntlet (`e2e/gauntlet/`, Fable §16.1) is the flagship gate: ten fresh sessions across ≥ 3 harnesses, join URL only. Pass: ≥ 8/10 full completions (pair, session, workshop, promote a falsifiable claim, recover from an injected 422), median ≤ 25K tokens.

---

## Testing And Verification

After substantive TypeScript changes:

```bash
bun run typecheck
bun run lint
bun test
```

Contract and face gates (once they exist):

```bash
bun run --filter @asimposium/contracts test
bun run --filter @asimposium/render test
```

Worker / D1:

```bash
cd apps/wire && bun test
```

Smoke (G0 / W3):

```bash
scripts/smoke-agent.sh     # join → hello → session → pack → workshop → refused self-cert → promote → delta → close
scripts/smoke-gallery.sh   # Google test login → mint pairing → workshop visible, public page omits it
```

Human E2E (staging, mock-free):

```bash
cd e2e && bunx playwright test
```

Gauntlet (before calling a surface agent-ready):

```bash
cd e2e/gauntlet && bun run gauntlet
```

`ubs --diff` over working-tree changes and `ubs --staged` immediately before each commit.

Do not mock D1 or R2 in integration tests. Use local D1 / wrangler bindings. `asimp validate` and the Worker must agree byte-for-byte on the golden corpus.

---

## Workstreams (do not skip G0)

Gate **G0** (Fable §17) retires load-bearing unknowns as running spikes:

- S-1 Capsule (3/3 unaided registrations: Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI), including fragment-secret handling
- S-2 Krater (D1 write transaction + cursor reads under simulated load; FTS5 + outbox DO alarm on real D1)
- S-3 The split, visibly (workshop card present for sponsor, absent from anonymous `/p/:id`; self-certification and near-duplicate refused with rule citations)
- S-4 Screening (FP < 5% on legitimate weird math; 0 FN on hard-reject; start Google OAuth verification)
- S-5 Diptych (one projection → md/json/html, golden-tested; pack determinism proven)
- S-6 Cross-plane auth (host-only Auth.js cookie; Agora → Worker signed envelope; `WRONG_PRINCIPAL` both directions)

Then, per Fable §17.2: W1 Contracts → W2 Krater → W3 Propylon (fragment join + approval card) → W4 Sessions + workshop → W5 Ledger + validator → W6 Stoa surface → W7 Herald → W8 Agora → W9 Symposiarch → W10 Hardening → W11 asimp → W12 Launch. Do not start Agora chrome before the Worker can accept a typed promotion.

---

## Helper Script Artifact Safety

Scripts that write under `e2e/artifacts` or similar must treat caller-provided run ids as path components, not trusted paths.

- Run ids: `^[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9._-]{0,79}$`.
- Artifact roots stay under the repository.

---

## Beads

Use `br` for roadmap and implementation tracking. **`br` never runs git.** After `br sync --flush-only`, manually `git add .beads/`.

```bash
br ready
br list --status=open
br show <id>
br create --title="..." --type=task|bug|feature|epic --priority=2
br update <id> --status=in_progress
br close <id> [--reason "..."]
br dep add <issue> <depends-on>
br dep cycles
br sync --flush-only
git add .beads/
```

Use the bead ID as the Agent-Mail `thread_id`. Do not run bare `bv`; use only `bv --robot-*`.

---

## MCP Agent Mail — Multi-Agent Coordination

In multi-agent sessions, register with Agent Mail, reserve files before editing, and coordinate through threads.

- `ensure_project` → `register_agent`
- `file_reservation_paths(..., exclusive=true, reason="br-###")`
- Prefer macros: `macro_start_session`, `macro_prepare_thread`

Treat unrecognized working-tree changes as peer work. Do not revert or overwrite them.

---

## UBS — Ultimate Bug Scanner

```bash
ubs --diff
ubs --staged
```

Critical: auth bypass, token or enrollment-secret leakage (including fragments in logs), XSS through markdown, SSRF, D1 injection, workshop bytes on a public face. Important: missing `fix_hint` on contract 4xx, Diptych drift, unauthenticated writes.

---

## cass — Cross-Agent Session Search

**Never run bare `cass` (TUI)**; always `--robot` or `--json`.

```bash
cass search "asimposium join capsule" --robot --limit 5
```

---

## Note for Codex/GPT agents — unexpected working-tree changes

If `git status` shows edits you did not make, those are from **other agents working on this project concurrently**. **NEVER** stash, revert, or overwrite another agent's work. Treat those changes as if you made them yourself.

---

## Note on Built-in TODO Functionality

If I explicitly ask you to use your built-in TODO functionality, do so without complaining that you need to use beads.

---

## Session Completion ("Landing the Plane")

Before finishing a work session you MUST:

1. File beads for remaining work.
2. Run quality gates if code changed (typecheck, lint, tests, `ubs --diff`).
3. Update issue status; close finished work.
4. `br sync --flush-only` and `git add .beads/`.
5. Hand off: what changed, gates run + results, remaining risks, concrete next steps.

Do not claim a surface is done unless the relevant Fable gate is actually green.
