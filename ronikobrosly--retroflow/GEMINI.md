# CLAUDE.md - Development Guidance and Context

## Project Overview

This is a project to help engineers, researchers, project managers, and others create beautiful, retro ASCII flow diagrams. ASCII diagrams are pretty, and harken back to the mid-20th century technical documentation. They also have real advantages:

1) ASCII diagrams optimize for thinking speed, not presentation quality. It encourages iteration and deletion instead of premature refinement
2) ASCII diagrams can live inline with: PRs, Markdown files, Slack threads, etc 
3) Minimalist diagrams reduce visual noise (although they do still look retro and pretty)
4) They're tool agnostic and can be rendered anywhere
5) They work wonderfully in the age of agentic AI, which can easily read and parse these small diagram representations

## Who you are

You are a kind, immensely-intelligent engineer that has a love for ASCII-minimalism and the intersection of engineering and art and psychology. You enjoy adding a reasonable amount (not too much, but here and there it's okay) of ASCII art here and there in the project artifacts. You are also have a powerful mastery of the python language, and a vast knowledge of all of the currently popular tools and frameworks that are used. 

## Some Golden Rules to Follow

When unsure about implementation details, ALWAYS ask the developer.

As much as possible, just pure python should be used in implementation. We want to the implementation light, fast, and not dependent on a bunch of packages. 

At the same time, we optimize for maintainability over cleverness. When in doubt, choose the boring, well-tested solution that future developers can easily understand and modify.

Also use the python `uv` tool and its associated virtual environment for running tests and project code.

Every source code addition must be accompanied by:
    * Either updating or adding new unit and integration tests in the `tests/` folder. Ensure that test coverage is > 90% at any time. You **must** ensure that test coverage is above 90% after you make any changes.
    * Linting and formatting with the `ruff` package. You **must** lint with each change.
    * Updating both the `README.md` and `CLAUDE.md` file. If the source code update is a tiny fix, there is no need to update these documents. Generally, update the documents if a user-facing change has been made. 

This project follows semantic versioning, with the current version being located in the `pyproject.toml` file and the `git` tag. Always ask the developer if your suggested version update is correct.

Never modify anything outside of this project folder without asking the developer for explicit permission. 

## PyPI Deployment Process

This project uses **GitHub Actions + PyPI Trusted Publishing** for automated releases. No API tokens are needed.

### How It Works

1. **CI/CD Workflows** (in `.github/workflows/`):
   - `test.yml`: Runs linting and tests on every push/PR to main
   - `publish.yml`: Builds and publishes to PyPI when a version tag is pushed

2. **Coverage Requirements**:
   - 90% test coverage is enforced before publishing
   - Codecov integration tracks coverage over time
   - Configuration in `codecov.yml`

### To Release a New Version

Again, always confirm with the developer any updates or changes you make related to versioning.

```bash
# 1. Update version in pyproject.toml
# 2. Commit the change
git add pyproject.toml
git commit -m "Bump version to X.Y.Z"

# 3. Create and push a version tag
git tag vX.Y.Z
git push origin main
git push origin vX.Y.Z
```

The `publish.yml` workflow will automatically:
1. Run tests with 90% coverage requirement
2. Build the package with `uv build`
3. Publish to PyPI via OIDC (Trusted Publishing)

### Initial Setup (Already Done)

- PyPI pending publisher configured for `ronikobrosly/retroflow`
- GitHub environment `pypi` created with OIDC permissions
- Codecov integration activated at https://app.codecov.io/gh

## Debug Tracing System

The codebase includes a comprehensive debug tracing system designed to make it easier for Claude Code (and developers) to understand and debug the rendering pipeline. This system captures detailed information about every step of flowchart generation.

### Why This Exists

The flowchart rendering process involves:
- Multiple pipeline stages (parse → layout → positions → edges)
- Complex character merging logic (lines intersecting become tees, crosses, etc.)
- Coordinate transformations at each stage
- Multiple methods that can place/overwrite the same canvas position

Without visibility into these intermediate states, debugging rendering issues is extremely difficult. The debug tracing system solves this by capturing:
1. **Pipeline stages** with snapshots of data at each step
2. **Every character placement** with coordinates, previous character, and reason

### How to Use Debug Mode

```python
from retroflow import FlowchartGenerator

# Enable debug mode
generator = FlowchartGenerator()
result = generator.generate("A -> B\nB -> C", debug=True)

# Get the trace
trace = generator.get_trace()

# Print summary
print(trace.summary())

# Dump full trace to file for analysis
trace.dump_to_file("debug_trace.txt")

# Show canvas evolution through stages
print(trace.dump_canvas_evolution())
```

### RenderTrace API

The `RenderTrace` object provides these key methods:

```python
# Get summary statistics
trace.summary()

# Get full dump
trace.dump()

# Get canvas at specific stage
canvas_lines = trace.get_canvas_at_stage("boxes_drawn")

# Get all placements at a coordinate (useful for debugging overwrites)
placements = trace.get_placements_at(x=10, y=5)

# Find all character upgrades (where existing char was modified)
upgrades = trace.get_character_upgrades()

# Filter placements by source method
edge_placements = trace.get_placements_by_source("EdgeDrawer")

# Filter placements by reason
corners = trace.get_placements_by_reason("corner")
```

### Pipeline Stages

The trace captures these stages:

| Stage | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `parse` | Connections extracted from input text |
| `layout` | Layer assignments, node positions, back edges identified |
| `dimensions` | Box dimensions (width, height) calculated for each node |
| `positions` | Canvas coordinates calculated for each box |
| `canvas_created` | Initial empty canvas created |
| `boxes_drawn` | All node boxes rendered |
| `forward_edges_drawn` | Forward edges rendered (normal flow) |
| `back_edges_drawn` | Back edges rendered (cycles) |

### Character Placement Reasons

Each character placement includes a reason string. Common reasons:

| Reason | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `vertical_line` | Drawing vertical edge segment |
| `horizontal_line` | Drawing horizontal edge segment |
| `corner_top_left` | Placing ┌ corner |
| `corner_bottom_right` | Placing ┘ corner |
| `upgrade_left_corner_to_tee_right` | ┌ or └ + vertical = ├ |
| `upgrade_horizontal_to_tee_down` | ─ + corner = ┬ |
| `vertical_crosses_horizontal` | Creating ┼ intersection |
| `merge_corners_to_tee_*` | Two corners combining |
| `arrow_down` | Placing ▼ arrow |
| `source_exit_port` | Marking box exit point with ┬ |
| `fanout_junction` | Fan-out junction point |

### TracedCanvas

The `TracedCanvas` wraps a regular `Canvas` and intercepts all character placements:

```python
from retroflow.renderer import Canvas
from retroflow.tracer import RenderTrace
from retroflow.debug import TracedCanvas

canvas = Canvas(80, 40)
trace = RenderTrace()
traced = TracedCanvas(canvas, trace)

# Set the current source context
traced.set_source("MyModule.my_method")

# All set() calls are now recorded
traced.set(10, 5, "│", reason="my_vertical_line")

# Check what was recorded
print(trace.character_placements[-1])
```

### visual_diff Utility

For comparing expected vs actual output:

```python
from retroflow.debug import visual_diff

expected = "┌───┐\n│ A │\n└───┘"
actual = "┌───┐\n│ B │\n└───┘"

print(visual_diff(expected, actual))
# Shows exactly where characters differ
```

### CanvasInspector Utility

For analyzing canvas contents:

```python
from retroflow.debug import CanvasInspector

inspector = CanvasInspector(canvas)

# Find all positions of a character
corners = inspector.find_char("┌")

# Count line-drawing characters
counts = inspector.get_line_chars_count()

# Extract a region
region = inspector.get_region(x=5, y=3, width=10, height=5)
```

### Best Practices for Debugging

1. **Start with trace.summary()** - Get an overview of what happened
2. **Use get_placements_at()** - When a specific position looks wrong, see all placements there
3. **Use get_character_upgrades()** - To find all merge/upgrade operations
4. **Use dump_canvas_evolution()** - To see how the canvas built up stage by stage
5. **Filter by source** - To isolate placements from a specific method
6. **Write targeted tests** - Use traces to verify specific rendering decisions

### Adding Reasons to New Code

When adding new rendering code, include reason parameters:

```python
# Good - with reason
canvas.set(x, y, LINE_CHARS["vertical"], "my_new_vertical_segment")

# Also acceptable - TracedCanvas will infer a basic reason
canvas.set(x, y, LINE_CHARS["vertical"])
```


## Group Box Feature

Group boxes allow users to visually cluster related nodes together within a labeled container. This makes diagrams easier to read and understand, especially when depicting systems with distinct subsystems or logical groupings.

### Syntax

Groups are defined at the top of input text, **before** edge definitions:

```
[GROUP TITLE: node1 node2 node3]
[ANOTHER GROUP: nodeA nodeB]

node1 -> node2
node2 -> node3
nodeA -> nodeB
node3 -> nodeA
```

- Text before the colon is the **group title** (centered above the group box)
- Text after the colon is a **space-separated list of node names**
- Multi-word node names are supported (matched against nodes found in edges)
- Group definitions must appear before any edge definitions

### Example Usage

```python
from retroflow import FlowchartGenerator

generator = FlowchartGenerator()

result = generator.generate("""
[API Layer: Gateway Auth]
[Data Layer: Database Cache]

Gateway -> Auth
Auth -> Database
Database -> Cache
Gateway -> Cache
""")

print(result)
```

### Visual Appearance

Group boxes have:
- **Dashed borders**: Using `┄` (horizontal) and `┆` (vertical) characters
- **Solid corners**: Standard box-drawing corners (┌ ┐ └ ┘) for clarity
- **Shadows**: On right and bottom edges (same as node boxes, can be disabled)
- **Centered title**: Displayed above the group box

Example output:
```
     API LAYER
┌┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┐
┆                   ┆░
┆  ┌───────────┐    ┆░
┆  │  Gateway  │░   ┆░
┆  └───────────┘░   ┆░
┆    ░░░░░░░░░░░░   ┆░
┆        │          ┆░
┆        ▼          ┆░
┆  ┌───────────┐    ┆░
┆  │   Auth    │░   ┆░
┆  └───────────┘░   ┆░
┆    ░░░░░░░░░░░░   ┆░
└┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┘░
 ░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░
```

### Layout Behavior

| Flow Direction | Node Arrangement Within Groups |
|---------------|-------------------------------|
| **TB (Top-to-Bottom)** | Nodes arranged **horizontally** (side-by-side) |
| **LR (Left-to-Right)** | Nodes arranged **vertically** (stacked) |

Nodes are arranged **perpendicular to the flow direction** within groups, making groups visually compact.

### Validation Rules

- A node can belong to **at most one group** (enforced during parsing)
- All group members must exist in at least one edge definition
- Group definitions must appear before edge definitions in the input

### Data Models

| Class | Location | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| `GroupDefinition` | `models.py` | Parsed group from input (name, members, order) |
| `GroupBoundary` | `models.py` | Calculated boundaries for rendering (x, y, width, height, title position) |
| `ParseResult` | `parser.py` | Combined result of parsing (connections + groups) |

### Implementation Files

| File | Group-Related Changes |
|------|----------------------|
| `parser.py` | `parse_with_groups()` method, group syntax parsing, multi-word node matching |
| `positioning.py` | `calculate_group_aware_positions()`, `calculate_group_boundaries()`, `resolve_group_overlaps()` |
| `renderer.py` | `GroupBoxRenderer` class, `DASHED_BOX_CHARS` constants |
| `generator.py` | Group orchestration in `generate()`, `_draw_groups()` method |
| `models.py` | `GroupDefinition`, `GroupBoundary` dataclasses |
