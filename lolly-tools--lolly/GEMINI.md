# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

Lolly is a constraint-first, template-driven platform for generating on-brand creative assets (PNG/SVG/PDF/video/etc.) from simple inputs. A single platform-agnostic **engine** runs the same render path across multiple **shells** (web PWA, Tauri desktop/mobile, CLI). Tools are **data, not bundled code** - a manifest + template + optional hooks - synced to clients so new tools ship without app updates.

The package name, repo, and working directory are all `lolly`.

## Commands

```bash
# This repo is split into submodules - community/ (tools), brands/suse/ (PRIVATE brand pack),
# services/{mcp,ca}, docs/, and every shells/* live in github.com/lolly-tools/*.
# Clone with --recurse-submodules, or:
git submodule update --init --recursive   # REQUIRED before npm install (workspaces need every package.json)
                                          # brands/suse is `update = none` (private) - SUSE devs opt in:
git submodule update --init --checkout brands/suse

npm install                  # install workspace deps; postinstall builds the tools/ + catalog PROFILE VIEWS

# Content profiles - tools/ and catalog/ at the repo root are gitignored VIEWS of the
# active profile (profiles.json), built by scripts/use-profile.ts. NEVER commit them.
npm run profile              # show active + available profiles
npm run profile:suse         # community + SUSE tools, SUSE catalog (needs brands/suse mounted)
npm run profile:start        # blank brand: community tools + a single neutral tokens asset (brands/lolly-start)
npm run ingest:brand -- <src> --name <brand> [--register|--activate]  # hydrate a brand pack from DTCG/Tokens-Studio/Penpot tokens (scripts/ingest-brand.ts)

npm run dev:web              # run the web shell (Vite) + live-rebuild the /info site on docs changes
npm run build:web            # production build of the web shell - builds the /info site first

# Run a tool headlessly via the CLI shell (jsdom + same engine path as web)
npm run cli                                              # list available tools
npm run cli -- qr-code                                   # show a tool's inputs
npm run cli -- qr-code --url=https://suse.com --output=./qr.svg
npm run cli -- qr-code --url=https://suse.com --export=png > qr.png

npm run validate:catalog     # validate every tool.json + asset against schemas & invariants
npm run build:catalog        # regenerate catalog/tools/index.json + asset checksums

# ...but both of the above only see the ACTIVE profile's view. `catalog/tools/index.json` is
# generated PER BRAND, so editing a community tool (which every brand's index lists) updates
# the active brand and leaves the others stale - and `validate:catalog` can't see that either,
# because it validates the active view too. The drift surfaces with no context on a public
# clone (no brands/suse → falls back to lolly-start) or in CI. After ANY community tool.json
# edit, use:
npm run build:catalog:all    # rebuild every mounted profile's catalog, then restore the active one
npm run validate:catalog:all # validate every mounted profile; exits 1 on drift. CI runs plain validate:catalog on the lolly-start view (public clone), so run this one locally before pushing a community tool.json edit
npm run build:info           # build the docs/info site once (docs/build.ts → shells/web/public/info/). Add --watch to rebuild on change; dev:web runs it in --watch, build:web runs it once. Plain `npm run dev` in shells/web does NOT build /info.
```

### Tests

The engine contract test suite lives at the repo root (`tests/`, node:test, no framework); `npm test` runs it together with the co-located suites in `engine/src/**`, `packages/{core,node-shell,docs-render}/test/`, `shells/web/src/**`, `shells/tui/src/**` and `services/mcp/test/` (the roots are `TEST_ROOTS` in `scripts/run-test-suite.ts`; see `tests/README.md` for layout + gated tests). To run just the repo-root suite:

```bash
node --test "tests/**/*.test.ts"
```

Use the quoted glob, not `node --test tests/` - on current Node the bare directory form tries to load `tests` as a module instead of discovering test files. The tests import engine modules across the workspace boundary via `../engine/src`, so the repo root owns the run.

Linting is Biome (`biome.json` at the repo root; `npm run lint` / `npm run lint:fix`). It is a ratcheting CI gate, not a clean one: CI runs `npm run lint:changed -- --all`, which fails any file whose finding count exceeds `security/lint-baseline.json` (`scripts/check-changed-lint.ts`); the baseline carries hundreds of pre-existing findings (705 errors as of 2026-09-06), so never treat a clean `biome lint` as a precondition and don't try to fix the backlog in passing - just never make a file worse (`npm run lint:baseline` rewrites the baseline after a reviewed fix). The codebase is **TypeScript** - engine, the shells, `packages/`, `scripts/`, `docs/build.ts`, and `tests/`; the only `.js` left in the migrated TS projects are tool `hooks.js`, which ship as tool *data* (not compiled); the vite configs, the web service worker (`shells/web/public/sw.js`), the chrome-extension, the generated `api/` bundles and vendored libs (`tools/*/lib/*.min.js`) remain `.js`. The `typecheck` script runs `tsc -p` across every project - `packages/core`, `packages/node-shell`, `engine/`, `shells/web/` (+ its tests tsconfig), `shells/cli/`, `shells/tui/`, `shells/tauri-shared/`, `tests/`, `scripts/`, and `services/mcp` - and then `npm run typecheck:tauri`. Node runs the `.ts` directly via native type-stripping; Vite/esbuild handle the web build.

The Tauri `bridge-overrides/` are `.ts` as of 2026-07-30 and typechecked, but **not** by a bare `tsc -p` step: they import `@tauri-apps/*` and the two Tauri shells are deliberately not npm workspaces, so a root `npm ci` never creates their `node_modules`. `scripts/typecheck-tauri.ts` (`npm run typecheck:tauri`) therefore skips with a logged reason when those are absent, so a plain clone is not punished; CI installs both shells `--omit=dev` and re-runs it with `--strict`, which fails on a skip so the gate cannot silently become a no-op. Run it locally with `npm --prefix shells/tauri-desktop ci --omit=dev` first. The logic both shells share (`shells/tauri-shared/bridge-overrides/state-fs.ts`) needs no Tauri packages - the dependency is inverted through an `fs` adapter for exactly that reason - so it has its own tsconfig and is checked unconditionally, and its return type is the web bridge's own `WebStateAPI` (type-only import), which is what now enforces the "state API surface must match the web shell" rule that used to be comment-only.

## Architecture

### The three-layer separation (this is the core idea)

```
engine/     ← platform-agnostic core. Knows NOTHING about brands, the DOM, storage, or networking.
shells/     ← host implementations. Each provides a "capability bridge" the engine calls into.
community/  ← brand-agnostic tool definitions (manifest + template + hooks). Data, not code. Public.
brands/     ← brand packs: suse/ (PRIVATE submodule: SUSE tools + catalog), lolly-start/ (blank, parent-owned).
tools/      ← VIEW (gitignored): the active profile's merged tool set - community/* ∪ brands/<active>/tools/*.
catalog/    ← VIEW (gitignored): symlink to the active brand's catalog.
```

- `engine/` has **no** dependency on a DOM library, framework, or storage backend (see `engine/package.json` - only `handlebars`, `ajv`, `fflate`, and the workspace tool-author SDK `@lolly-tools/core`). Everything platform-specific is injected at runtime by the shell via the bridge.
- **Tools never import from the engine** and never touch the DOM/filesystem/network directly. They call `host.*` methods. This is what makes one tool run unchanged in browser, Tauri, and CLI.
- **Repository split (done - brand-pack layout since 2026-07-08):** content is mounted as packs: `community/` → public [`lolly-tools`](https://github.com/lolly-tools/lolly-tools) (the brand-agnostic tools: the studios, utilities, qr-code, street-map, filter), `brands/suse/` → **private** `suse-lolly` (the SUSE tools + the full SUSE catalog, incl. tokens and the PremiumBeat music - private, so the old 2026-08-29 public-removal deadline no longer applies to it), plus `services/mcp`, `services/ca`, `docs/`, and every `shells/*` as public submodules. `engine/`, `schemas/`, `api/`, `scripts/`, `tests/`, `brands/lolly-start/`, and `profiles.json` stay in this parent repo. The repo-root `tools/` and `catalog/` are gitignored **profile views** built by `scripts/use-profile.ts` (symlink farm; real copies on Vercel where `postinstall` runs with `VERCEL=1`, and the views are `.vercelignore`d) - every script/shell/deploy path still consumes those two paths unchanged. `brands/suse` is `update = none` in `.gitmodules` so public clones (and CI) skip the private pack and fall back to the `lolly-start` profile. The split toolkit + day-to-day workflow live in `scripts/subrepo/` (see its README); `loldev profile <name>` switches profiles. Editing a SUSE tool touches two repos (`suse-lolly` + parent pointer); a community tool touches three (`lolly-tools` manifest, `suse-lolly` regenerated `index.json`, parent pointer). The no-cross-imports rule stays enforced so the split stays clean. **Do not add SUSE-specific or DOM-specific logic to `engine/`, and never commit the `tools/`/`catalog/` views.** The retired `lolly-suse-tools` / `lolly-suse-catalog` repos are archived (2026-08-22); `lolly-suse-catalog` was also made private, taking the PremiumBeat music off the public internet ahead of the 2026-08-29 deadline.

### The Capability Bridge (`engine/src/bridge/host-v1.ts`)

The versioned contract between tools and shells (`ENGINE_VERSION`, 1.181.0 as of 2026-09-06, defined in `engine/src/version.ts` and re-exported from `engine/src/index.ts` - `engine/CHANGELOG.md` tracks each minor; read the live value in `version.ts` rather than trusting this number). As of 1.53 `loadTool` **enforces** a tool manifest's `engineVersion` range against this value: a tool whose range excludes the running engine is refused, not loaded (see `engine/src/semver-range.ts`). The contract's canonical definition lives in `packages/core/src/host-v1.ts` (the tool-author SDK `@lolly-tools/core`, so third parties can build against it without depending on the engine); `engine/src/bridge/host-v1.ts` is now a type re-export of it, and engine/shell code keeps importing from that path unchanged. `HostV1` exposes the required `profile`, `assets`, `state`, `clipboard`, `export`, and `log`, plus optional/additive APIs (added in minor versions, never removed): `net` (allowlisted fetch), `tokens` (DTCG design tokens), `text` (text-to-path via HarfBuzz WASM - v1.29 adds `variations` for variable-font weights and a `fallbackFonts` chain for disjoint webfont subsets; `fallbackFonts` shapes a run across disjoint webfont subsets, `notdef` reports uncovered glyphs so callers can keep a `<text>` fallback, and v1.30 `axisDefaults` reports a variable font's default instance so a jsPDF-embed caller knows the weight it'll get), `pdf` (analyze/strip/compress), `capture` (rasterise a live URL), `compose` (nested tool renders - `render()` for authored `composes`, plus `renderUrl()` (v1.3) for the end-user path where a Lolly tool link pasted into the asset picker becomes an image; a tool-sourced asset's id is its canonical embed URL, re-rendered on load - see `engine/src/tool-url.ts`), `audio` (v1.71 - analyse a finished clip into a per-frame reactivity track: RMS, a bass/mid/treble split, a log-spaced spectrum, onset flux, tempo/beats, and opt-in raw time-domain windows. The dual of `recorder.meter`'s live sampling; the shell owns the decoder, the engine's `analysePcm` owns the maths, so web and CLI read identical numbers. `bpm` is `null` when there is no rhythm - never treat that as 120), and `media` (v1.4 - a live camera frame source for motion-reactive tools; DOM-free RGBA frames drive a tool's `onFrame` hook, e.g. the `filter-*` tools' "Go live" mode. Progressive enhancement - NOT gated by the `camera` capability flag; the runtime owns the frame loop via `startLive()`/`stopLive()`), and `recorder` (v1.17 - mic/AV capture + a DOM-free audio-level meter driving the `onLevel` hook for the recording tools; gated by the `microphone`/`camera` capabilities). `export` itself has `render()` (rasterise a DOM node), `download()`, and `file()` - the v1.1 on-device transform path (file-in → bytes-out), which never watermarks or embeds provenance. Rules that matter when editing it:

- Methods may be **added** in a minor version; never removed or signature-changed without a major bump. When v2 ships, v1 must keep working.
- **No platform-specific methods** on the bridge. If only Tauri can do something, it goes behind a `capabilities` flag declared in `tool.json`, and shells that can't fulfill it expose a stub/error.
- Storage always goes through `host.state` - the bridge picks IndexedDB (web), filesystem (Tauri), or memory (CLI). **No `localStorage`** for tool state. (The web shell does use `localStorage` for chrome preferences, FOUC mirrors, dismissed-tip flags, feature flags and catalog ETag caches - 20-odd keys across three prefixes, `lolly-`, `lolly.`, `lolly:` - but never for tool state or anything a tool can read.)

### The runtime lifecycle (`engine/src/runtime.ts`)

`createRuntime(tool, host, initialState)` orchestrates one mounted tool: load → build input model → resolve asset refs → run `onInit` hook → hydrate template → export. Key concepts:

- **Input model** (`engine/src/inputs.ts`) is the single source of truth for input semantics. Shells *render* the model generically; they never interpret manifest declarations themselves. That's how web/Tauri/CLI stay consistent.
- **Hook patch semantics:** hooks return a plain object. Keys matching a declared input `id` update that input's value; keys with no match go into `extras` - a parallel store of computed values the template can reference directly (e.g. QR module lists, chart data) without being declared as user-facing inputs.
- **Hooks run with the host bridge injected (not isolated):** loaded via `new Function('host', ...)` so the `host` bridge is the supported, portable API surface passed in - but this is closure-scope injection only, **not** a security sandbox. Hooks still execute in the realm's global scope, so in a browser shell they *can* reach `window`/`document`/`fetch` (some shipping tools rely on it); `host.*` is the intended path, not an enforced boundary. Async hook results are time-boxed (`HOOK_BUDGET_MS` in `runtime.ts`, exported mutable for tests: `onInit` 5s, `onInput` 2s, `beforeExport`/`afterExport` 5s, `exportFile` 10s, `exportStill` 10s): the race abandons the wait and applies no patch NOW, but the hook keeps executing - and (v1.146) a raced-out `onInit`/`onInput`'s late resolution still applies when it arrives iff no newer onInit/onInput run started since (export hooks never late-apply). Synchronous runaway code can't be preempted in-realm, so a sync overrun is only measured and logged as a warning. `onInit`/`onInput` errors are logged, not thrown; `beforeExport`/`exportFile` errors (incl. timeouts) fail that export visibly, and `afterExport` (the cleanup guarantee in export's `finally`) is caught + logged so it can't mask a render error. The v1.4 `onFrame` hook (live camera) and `onLevel` run once per frame/sample, are NOT time-boxed, and the runtime drops overlapping frames so a slow per-frame render self-throttles. Worker isolation exists: the web shell's Worker executor (`shells/web/src/bridge/hook-worker.ts`) and the Node `worker_threads` executor (`packages/node-shell/src/hook-worker.ts`, `LOLLY_HOOK_WORKER=1` on the CLI) share the engine's `hook-worker-core.ts` (protocol + host-proxy policy: color/geom/tokens co-located, the rest proxied by RPC, sync feature-detects seeded). A tool opts in with manifest `isolate: true`, which `scripts/tool-isolation.ts` sets from evidence - hooks free of realm-bound globals AND a byte-identical `lolly smoke` render in-realm vs worker (`--verify --write`, or `--write --from=<realmDir>,<workerDir>`); 30 community tools carry it as of 2026-09-06, with in-realm fallback if a Worker cannot start. Sideloaded/remote tools always get the strict, fail-closed executor.
- **Experimental tools watermark exports** by default: `export()` resolves `watermark: opts.watermark ?? (isExperimental && !isOnDevice)` (`runtime.ts`), so an explicit caller `watermark: false` overrides it and on-device (`privacy: 'on-device'`) tools are exempt. Default-on, not forced.

### Templates (`engine/src/template.ts`)

Handlebars, **logic-less by design** - so non-developers can author them (`{{x}}` escapes; `{{{x}}}` is opt-in raw). In practice 46 of 78 templates use `{{{` for hook-computed markup, JSON-in-`<script>` and style strings, so the XSS story rests on each `hooks.js` escaping what it hands the template (the `_shared` `esc` region), not on Handlebars alone. Tools needing real logic use `hooks.js`. Custom helpers: `default`, `upper`, `lower`, `eq`, `markdown` (tiny subset), `asset` (`{{asset logo}}` → url, `{{asset logo "width"}}` → field), `framing`, `media`, plus data-format helpers for sibling text templates (`template.ics`/`.vcf`/`.csv`) - `icsStamp` (date → iCal basic form), `rfcText` (RFC 5545/6350 escaping), `csvCell` (RFC 4180 quoting), and `arrow` (leading `>` `<` `^` `v` → `→ ← ↑ ↓`). `annotateTemplate` wraps input references in HTML comment markers so the web shell can map rendered DOM nodes back to sidebar controls.

### URL mode is first-class (`engine/src/url-mode.ts`)

Every input must be expressible as URL params. **The CLI is URL mode under a different transport** - `--foo=bar` argv pairs become the same values the web shell parses from `?foo=bar`. One render path, so CLI and GUI never drift. Reserved params (not inputs): `format`, `export`, `copy`, `full`, `options`, `slot`, `output`, `filename`, `_v`, `width`/`w`, `height`/`h`, `unit`, `dpi`, `bleed`, `marks`, `cuts`, `c2pa`, `imprint`, `durable`, `hdr`, `depth`, `password`, `profile`, `nostage`, `lang`, `ds`, `z`, `zx`, `meta`, `designv`, `template`, `preset`, `present`, `s`, `kiosk`, `fps`, `seconds`, `wait`, `codec`, `vq` - the live set is `RESERVED` in `engine/src/url-mode.ts`, asserted against a documented copy by `tests/engine.test.ts`. Tools can opt into compact encoding (`urlKey` aliases, `#`-less colors, tilde-delimited block arrays).

**Physical units:** `width`/`height` are values in `unit` (`px` default, or `mm`/`cm`/`in`/`pt`); `dpi` sets raster resolution for physical units (default 300). Conversion happens at export time per format - PDF→points (true page size), SVG→unit+px-viewBox, raster→pixels at DPI (PNG embeds a `pHYs` DPI chunk). The math is the engine's single source of truth in `engine/src/units.ts` (`parseDimension`, `toPixels`, `toPoints`, `toCssLength`, …); each shell's export bridge (`shells/web/src/bridge/export.ts`, `shells/cli/src/bridge.ts`) applies it per format.

## Tools: anatomy and invariants

A tool is a directory under `tools/<id>/`:

```
tools/<id>/
├── tool.json        # required - manifest (validated against schemas/tool.schema.json)
├── template.html    # required - Handlebars markup
├── styles.css       # optional - auto-scoped to the tool canvas
├── hooks.js         # optional - imperative escape hatch (only if manifest declares `hooks`)
├── thumb.png        # optional - gallery thumbnail
└── assets/          # optional - tool-local assets (not in the global catalog)
```

- **Inputs are declared in the manifest, not inferred from the template.** Input types: `text`, `longtext`, `number`, `boolean`, `color`, `select`, `asset`, `date`, `time`, `datetime-local`, `url`, `blocks` (repeating field groups - see `meeting-planner` for the reference implementation), `vector` (a fixed group of numbers as one control), `table`, and `file` (the user's own file, bytes in memory - for on-device transform utilities like `strip-data`).
- Any input can `bindToProfile: "firstname"` to pre-fill from the user profile.
- **`requires` names the optional `host.*` APIs the hooks call unguarded** (`packages/core/src/host-v1/apis.ts` is the enumerable list; `createRuntime` refuses to mount when the host lacks one; `toolSupport` greys the tool out in the gallery). Generated, not hand-written: `node scripts/tool-requires.ts --write` reads hooks.js, writes the list and raises the `engineVersion` floor; `validate:catalog` and `tests/tool-requires.test.ts` fail on drift. `capabilities` stays the device-ability list (camera, microphone, screen, …).
- See `docs/authoring-tools.md` for the full authoring guide and `docs/url-mode.md` for URL encoding.

### Hard invariants (changing these is a major undertaking)

- **Tool `id` and asset `id` are permanent contracts.** `suse/logo/primary` never gets renamed or reused. Version in the manifest, never in the path.
- After editing any `tool.json` or asset, run `npm run build:catalog` then `npm run validate:catalog`. The manifest is the source of truth; `catalog/tools/index.json` is *generated* and must not drift (the validator fails CI if it does). The validator also checks asset checksums, file existence, `bindToProfile` fields, palette references, and `replacedBy` chains.

## Repository layout

| Path | Role |
|---|---|
| `engine/src/` | The engine modules (top-level, plus `geom/` and `bridge/host-v1.ts`) - see `engine/README.md`'s generated table for the live count and map. `engine/README.md` carries the full module map - one row per module with line count, purpose, whether `index.ts` re-exports it, its test file and whether it is fuzzed - generated by `node scripts/gen-engine-modules.ts`, so read it there rather than duplicating a list here. Core: `index.ts` (public surface), `loader.ts`, `runtime.ts`, `inputs.ts`, `template.ts`, `validate.ts`, `url-mode.ts`, `units.ts`. Everything else is a format/feature module. `bridge/host-v1.ts` is a type re-export of `@lolly-tools/core/host-v1` and holds no types of its own |
| `shells/web/` | Vite PWA. Bridge impls under `src/bridge/`, views under `src/views/`, catalog sync under `src/catalog/` (all `.ts`) |
| `shells/cli/` | `bin/lolly.ts` (entry), `src/run.ts` (jsdom render), `src/bridge.ts` (CLI bridge) |
| `shells/tauri-desktop`, `shells/tauri-mobile` | Tauri shells with `bridge-overrides/` (`.ts`, typechecked via `npm run typecheck:tauri`) |
| `shells/tauri-shared/` | parent-owned `bridge-overrides/state-fs.ts` - the filesystem state logic BOTH Tauri shells call into, over an injected `fs` adapter |
| `community/` | 60 brand-agnostic tool dirs (design, darkroom, filter, flythrough, qr-code, street-map, strip-data, text-helper, gradient, chart, compress-pdf, countdown-timer, url-shot, the PDF utilities, …) plus `_shared/` - public submodule `lolly-tools` |
| `brands/suse/` | PRIVATE submodule `suse-lolly`: `tools/` (18 SUSE tool dirs) + `catalog/` (assets incl. `assets/suse/tokens/brand.json`, fonts, previews, og, generated `tools/index.json`) |
| `brands/lolly-start/` | parent-owned blank brand: `tools/` (voice-recorder) + a neutral `catalog/` (assets/fonts/og/previews + generated `tools/index.json`) - where the brand-import (DTCG) experience gets built |
| `tools/`, `catalog/` | gitignored profile VIEWS of the above (scripts/use-profile.ts + profiles.json) - what every script/shell actually reads |
| `packages/` | `core` (`@lolly-tools/core` - canonical `host-v1.ts` contract + tool-author SDK), `node-shell` (shared Node host pieces for CLI/TUI) |
| `schemas/` | `tool.schema.json`, `asset.schema.json`, `asset-ref.schema.json`, `tokens.schema.json`, `canonical-inputs.json` |
| `scripts/` | `build-catalog-index.ts`, `checksum-assets.ts`, `validate-catalog.ts`, `use-profile.ts`, `ingest-brand.ts`, … |
| `api/` | Vercel serverless functions. `api/mcp/[...path].js` and `api/ca/[...path].js` are GENERATED esbuild bundles (`scripts/build-mcp-fn.ts` / `scripts/build-ca-fn.ts`) - never hand-edit them; CI's api-bundles job rebuilds and fails on drift |
| `docs/` | architecture, authoring guides, positioning, URL mode; `build.ts` builds the info site |
| `plans/` | **gitignored, local to the maintainer's machine** - any `plans/NN-…` reference in code comments or docs points at a file that is not in any repo. Treat those as citations you cannot follow, not as required reading |

## Features

### Font upload

Users add fonts in the web shell's brand editor Fonts tab (`shells/web/src/lib/brand-editor.ts`) - upload a TTF/OTF/WOFF file, or pick a Google Font that is fetched once and kept on-device (`shells/web/src/lib/google-fonts.ts`). Uploaded faces are validated and their family/weight/style metadata parsed by `shells/web/src/lib/font-utils.ts`, then stored in IndexedDB as user font assets by `shells/web/src/user-fonts.ts`. For vector export, `shells/web/src/bridge/font-registry.ts` resolves a computed `font-family` stack to an actual fetchable font file - the brand catalog's SUSE statics first, then user fonts (decompressing woff2 to sfnt on-device, since HarfBuzz can't read woff2), then the shell-served platform faces (SUSE upright **and italic**, plus Outfit for anything that still names it) - and returns an ordered fallback chain so disjoint Google-font unicode subsets shape correctly. Test coverage: `tests/font-upload-edge-cases.test.ts` (font-utils/user-fonts against the real modules), plus co-located `shells/web/src/bridge/font-registry.test.ts` and `shells/web/src/user-fonts.test.ts`. There is no coverage of `parseFontMetadata` against a *real* sfnt - the edge-case suite only feeds it synthetic/corrupt buffers.

---

### Smooth gradients

"Smooth" means perceptual OKLab interpolation instead of muddy linear-RGB blends. The math lives in the engine: `rampOklab` in `engine/src/color-tools.ts` (exported from `engine/src/index.ts`), with OKLCH conversions in `engine/src/brand-derive.ts`; gradient token entries (`type: 'gradient'`) resolve through `engine/src/tokens.ts`. Brand palette gradients are authored in the web shell's brand editor (`shells/web/src/lib/brand-editor.ts`). The Mesh Gradient tool (`community/gradient/`) is an ordinary data-only tool, not an engine feature: its `hooks.js` builds the whole SVG as a string of stacked `<radialGradient>`s over a base fill (there is no SVG `<meshpatch>` anywhere in this codebase). Test coverage: `tests/gradient-round-trip.test.ts` (gradient tokens round-trip), `tests/color-ramp.test.ts` (rampOklab behaviour, including re-import of SVG stop colours via the real `extractSvgColors` parser), and `tests/svg-colors.test.ts` (`engine/src/svg-colors.ts`).

---

### Docs screenshots are vector

Every `/info` screenshot is an SVG unless it physically cannot be. Recipes live inline in `docs/*.md` as `url-shot` links; `scripts/build-docs-shots.ts` captures them, and `walker=1&format=svg` (the web shell's own DOM→SVG walker, `renderSvgFromHtml`) is the path that works - reach for it first, not the print path and never a raster. The live counts are whatever `docs/shots/` holds (346 SVG, 10 PNG as of 2026-09-06).

The raster allowlist lives in `tests/docs-shots-vector.test.ts` - the only place a bitmap may be declared, each with a written reason. The test fails **both** ways: a new `format=png` recipe that isn't listed, and a listed slug that is no longer raster. That second direction is the point. The original PNG list was not a set of measured limits - twelve of twenty were born `format=png` in the first screenshot commit and were never re-tested after the walker landed; when they finally were, they converted unchanged (Mesh Gradient: a 708 KB PNG → a 6 KB SVG of real `<radialGradient>` stops). `format=png` carried no expiry, so a workaround became a property of the file. Don't add a raster without adding its reason, and don't leave a reason standing once it stops being true.

The current entries and their reasons are in `RASTER_ALLOWED` in that test; read them there rather than here, because the set shrinks (the gallery, audiogram and neuro-viz shots that were once listed have all since gone vector).

**Authoring a shot that needs content on an app surface** (how the `design` shot is made): author the state in the live app, then lift it from the URL - the design tool serializes continuously to `?z=` (tag `'1'` + base64url of raw-DEFLATEd readable query; `zlib.inflateRawSync`/`deflateRawSync` round-trips it), so the recipe carries a `z=` token and reproduces forever. Never type text on the canvas while authoring - bare keystrokes are tool shortcuts (V pointer, P pen, N node; Shift+H / Shift+V flip; the full list is `design-shortcuts.ts`) - hand-edit the decoded query instead. An image box's src slot takes a composed-tool embed URL (`https://lolly.tools/tool/<id>.svg?...`) or a bare catalog asset id (`lolly/logo/primary`). Three traps: captures pin the **lolly-start profile** (SUSE tools/assets don't exist at capture time and must never reach the public docs repo); `[data-export-hide]` editor chrome (`.fc-toolbar-dock` etc.) is detached from every walker render by design, so a shot whose subject includes it must be `format=png` with a reasoned `RASTER_ALLOWED` entry (`design` is the precedent); and `dpi=192` halves the CSS viewport, so width must keep it above the 640px breakpoint where free-canvas drops the toolbar dock (the design recipe is 1360×850@192 → 680 CSS px). After any recipe edit, run `scripts/propagate-shot-recipes.ts`, then `scripts/build-docs-shots.ts --only=<slug> --accept`.

**Captures always frame the filmstrip, never Cover Flow** (`captureNeutralPinned()` forces it in `views/gallery.ts`). Not taste - Cover Flow fans its covers with a 3-D `rotateY` that `parseCssMatrix` refuses (covers come out mis-scaled or blank in vector), and it must keep its rAF loop running to lay the fan out, so it can never be fully still.

**A vector baseline compares EXACTLY, so `tolerance=` is inert on one** - the pipeline warns when a recipe sets it. Everything a raster baseline's pixel budget used to absorb becomes churn the moment a shot goes vector: JS-driven motion (`FREEZE_CSS` only zeroes CSS animation), `content-visibility: auto` skipping off-screen subtrees, and observer-driven lazy hydration. The counters live in `lib/capture-neutral.ts` - a capture counts as reduced motion, every example strip hydrates up front, and `settleForCapture()` stamps `data-shots-settled` once the DOM stops growing, which recipes wait on via `waitSelector=`.

Two rules that fall out of this. **`cropSelector` means "frame this", not "walk this subtree entire"** - a walker crop is windowed to `min(element box, recipe frame)`, matching what the print path always did. And **`scripts/propagate-shot-recipes.ts` syncs, it does not just insert**: `docs/build.ts` reads `format=` off each *locale* page, so changing an English recipe without syncing leaves 26 translations pointing at a retired file. Skip-if-present is not idempotence when the thing you skipped has since changed.

### Text outline export

On vector export (SVG/PDF) the web shell converts rendered HTML text runs into real `<path>` outlines so recipients don't need the font installed. The walk lives in `shells/web/src/bridge/export.ts`, which shapes each line via `host.text.toPath` - the HarfBuzz-WASM-backed bridge primitive implemented in `shells/web/src/bridge/text.ts`, whose contract (including `variations`, `fallbackFonts`, `notdef`, and `axisDefaults`) is defined in `packages/core/src/host-v1.ts`. Pure helpers in `shells/web/src/bridge/text-svg.ts` handle SUSE font-file resolution, baseline placement, and font-feature/letter-spacing parsing; `shells/web/src/bridge/font-registry.ts` supplies the font file + fallback chain. A run with no resolvable font file falls back to a plain SVG `<text>` element. Test coverage: `shells/web/src/bridge/text-svg.test.ts` and `font-registry.test.ts` cover the pure helpers only - the actual `<path>` emission in `shells/web/src/bridge/export.ts` has **no direct test coverage** and is verified manually by exporting an HTML tool to SVG.

### Accessibility preferences

Four opt-in prefs - `reduceMotion`, `highContrast`, `largeText`, `hidePreviews` - set in the web shell's `/profile` view and stored on the canonical `Profile` record (`Profile.a11y` in `packages/core/src/host-v1.ts`), exactly like the theme preference: profile canonical, `localStorage` (`lolly-a11y`) only the FOUC mirror the pre-paint inline script in `shells/web/index.html` reads, and a data attribute on `<html>` as the live switch - `data-a11y-motion="reduce"`, `data-a11y-contrast="high"`, `data-a11y-text="large"`, `data-a11y-previews="hidden"`. `hidePreviews` ("Hide colourful previews", 2026-07-30 - formerly the gallery filter popover's device-local `lolly-hide-previews` toggle, migrated once at boot in `main.ts` then the old key removed) collapses gallery/utilities cards and the featured strip to icon + text (`styles/parts/gallery.css`, its documented contract sheet; utility tiles keep their absolute favourite/pin/info cluster - the old in-flow drop clipped them out of the fixed 4/3 box), and EXCEPTS the Projects/session thumbnails: `styles/parts/folders.css` calms them with `filter: saturate(.5) contrast(.5)` (Andy's tuned values, 2026-07-30 - replaced the earlier luminosity-blend tint) so they stay recognisable without the colour noise. The canonical API is `shells/web/src/lib/a11y-prefs.ts` (`applyA11yPrefs`/`hydrateA11yPrefs` from `main.ts`'s boot, `setA11yPref` to flip one, `prefersReducedMotion()` as the shared read for JS-driven animation sites - it ORs the OS media query with the app pref). Strictly additive on the jelly-effects model: every attribute defaults to absent, so with nothing turned on no selector matches and the regular experience is byte-identical. Each gated block sits beside the OS-preference block it extends - `html[data-a11y-motion="reduce"]` under the `prefers-reduced-motion` block in `styles/parts/base.css`, contrast token overrides **unlayered** in `styles/tokens.css` (they must out-specify the unlayered runtime brand block `brand-vars.ts` appends at (0,1,0), which is why they are attribute-qualified on `html`, not `:root`), the type scale in `styles/parts/a11y.css` (the `a11y` layer, last, so it wins over views). `largeText` is a pure custom-property multiplier: `:root { --a11y-fs: 1 }`, `html[data-a11y-text="large"] { --a11y-fs: 1.2 }`, and every CHROME font size written as `font-size: calc(13px * var(--a11y-fs))` - so with the attribute absent each computed size is byte-identical, and the factor is tunable in one edit. Chrome ICON sizes ride the same multiplier (`width: calc(18px * var(--a11y-fs))`, and the jelly shadow-DOM size tokens in `lib/jelly.ts`) rather than a second token: dozens of controls are an aria-label plus an `<svg>` with no visible text, and under 640px `parts/topbar.css` reduces the top-level nav to 18px glyphs inside a button that already grows with `--chrome-h`. Sizing is CSS-only - `lib/icons.ts`'s inline `width`/`height` attributes stay put, since other code measures and clones that markup. The root font-size is deliberately NOT touched, so `rem` never moves and the tools that style themselves in `rem` (`community/url-shot`, `community/screencap`, `brands/suse/tools/color-palette`) render and export unchanged. **Do not reach for CSS `zoom` here** - it was tried and torn out: standardized zoom (Chrome M128+) makes `getBoundingClientRect()` return zoom-scaled values while an inline `left:Npx` resolves in the zoomed space, which mispositions every popover, float panel and canvas handle across the 23 files that mix the two, and pinning it back out of the export stages needs a hand-maintained counter-zoom list that already missed `pro/render-export.ts`'s `.pro-export-canvas`, `views/multi-edit.ts`'s `.me-scale` and `lib/audio-cover-bake.ts`. **These prefs are chrome-only and deliberately never reach inside `.tool-canvas`/`#tool-content`/`#tool-canvas` or the export stages**: a render is the user's creative output, and its geometry is shared with the CLI's export path, so a calmer app must not move a pixel of an exported PNG/SVG/PDF. Test coverage: `shells/web/src/lib/a11y-prefs.test.ts` exercises the module itself (attributes applied/cleared, the mirror, profile hydration precedence, persistence), and `a11y-prefs-contract.test.ts` scans the real stylesheets and `index.html` - every `data-a11y` reference is a gated attribute selector, each pref is gated in its documented sheet, the canvas exemptions hold in both the OS and app reduced-motion blocks, `tokens.css` stays unlayered, the pre-paint script matches the module, and the multiplier only ever leaves a glyph-size property (type, icon box/paint, or a custom property). Two categories are knowingly NOT covered, because no CSS mechanism reaches them: text painted into a canvas (`lib/particles.ts` sizes its confetti labels in JS), and text baked into an image - the per-tool/per-view OG cards, tool `thumb.png` and `card.html` banners, the catalog preview SVGs, the `/info` screenshots in `docs/shots`. A whole-UI zoom would have scaled those; the type multiplier is the trade for keeping exports byte-identical. Still unverified: nothing has been checked in a real browser, so the pref has never been run against an actual export or a full-height (`vh`/`dvh`) sheet, and clipping in fixed-height controls at 1.2 is untested.
