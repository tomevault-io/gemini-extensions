# Working in this repo

Point-in-time retrieval of Luxembourg law and a reviewed, configuration-led EU corpus. The product claim is that an answer
can be *checked* rather than trusted, so the rules below are not style preferences: most of them
exist because breaking them produced a confidently wrong answer at some point.

## Hard rules

**Scoped `git add` only. Never `git add -A`.** A cloud session edits docs in this repo in
parallel; a blanket add sweeps its work into your commit.

**Never read the law data files.** `works/`, `*.xml`, `*.html`, and law `*.json` in
`lex-articles` or the corpus repos. They are large and reading them tells you nothing the index
cannot. Query `deploy/indexes/*.db` with SQLite instead.

**No em dashes or en dashes in published text.** Site copy, README, release notes, PR bodies,
commit messages. Hyphens in compounds are fine. This does not apply to ingested law or to code
comments.

**Never write the Azure OpenAI key to disk.** Fetch inline, env var only:
`az cognitiveservices account keys list -n oai-soufien-dev -g rg-soufien-portfolio --query key1 -o tsv`

**Never commit `C:\lex-ops\signing-key.pem`.**

**Only official publisher endpoints.** Respect `robots.txt`. User-Agent
`Lex/0.1 (+https://github.com/SFHAJJI/lex)`.

## Build V3, do not evolve V2 into it

Owner ruling, 2026-08-29. The goal is a V3 that is clean and consistent with the V3 specs. The
journey there does not have to be clean.

Breaking changes are allowed. Deleting a component is allowed. **Deleting unit tests and
integration tests is allowed** when they describe V2 behaviour that a V3 component replaces. Do not
spend effort preserving, migrating or negotiating around something V3 removes. If a test, a guard or
a contract stands between you and implementing a V3 component as specified, delete it and say so in
the commit; do not build machinery to satisfy it.

The failure this corrects: two co-owners spent a day on an acceptance protocol for page snapshots
while the pages themselves were scheduled to be replaced by a new index roughly three times the
scope and a new dossier architecture. Eight contract revisions, no product change. That is the shape
to watch for. Process is not the product.

This applies to both co-owners.

### Golden snapshots are diagnostics during V3

Page and MCP tool-response snapshots remain committed as optional review evidence, but no golden
comparison or approval is a gate for a pull request, rebuild, promotion, or deployment. Normal test
runs skip byte-for-byte snapshot comparison while continuing to run the targeted contract,
architecture, and browser assertions beside the snapshots.

Run a snapshot comparison only when it is useful to the product change being reviewed:

```bash
LEX_GOLDEN_VERIFY=1 dotnet test tests/Lex.Tests/Lex.Tests.csproj
LEX_GOLDEN_UPDATE=1 dotnet test tests/Lex.Tests/Lex.Tests.csproj
git diff --numstat tests/Lex.Tests/golden/
```

An update is intentional evidence, not an approval mechanism. Read any resulting diff before
committing it. Never add a golden-diff workflow or status context to required checks, rebuild,
signing, deployment or promotion gates. The existing `trusted-golden-diff` workflow and its
tooling tests are non-blocking diagnostics only; its classifier step is explicitly allowed to fail.

For JSON tool snapshots, the classifier accepts only exact RFC 6901 additions. Tool responses use
the fixed outer `pointer` `/result/content/0/text` plus a `document_pointer` into its JSON string.
`tools-list.txt` uses a direct `pointer`. The declarations must match the changed files and pointers
exactly. Base and head JSON must use the family-specific canonical snapshot layout and preserve
every existing value's type, lexical token and key order. MCP snapshots also require the exact
canonical raw outer string encoding at `/result/content/0/text`. Documents must stay within 128
levels and 100,000 parsed nodes, and files must remain under 8 MiB:

```json
{
  "schema": "lex-golden-diff-intent/1",
  "base_commit": "0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567",
  "additions": [
    {
      "file": "tests/Lex.Tests/golden/tool-search.txt",
      "pointer": "/result/content/0/text",
      "document_pointer": "/new_field"
    },
    {
      "file": "tests/Lex.Tests/golden/tools-list.txt",
      "pointer": "/result/tools/17"
    }
  ]
}
```

For page-only changes, use a nonempty `html_selectors` array with exactly one narrow `#id` or
`[data-testid="value"]` selector for each changed page snapshot. The classifier locates that exact
element subtree and requires every byte outside it to remain unchanged. Human diff review remains
defense in depth after machine scope verification. The classifier reads
both revisions as strict UTF-8 HTML with a conservative 8 MiB per-file ceiling. A base-controlled
Node helper uses exact `parse5` 8.0.1 HTML5 tree construction with source locations. It rejects
every parse error except the pages' existing missing-doctype condition, requires an explicit target
boundary, and verifies that source-backed DOM descendants and non-descendants agree with that
boundary before returning byte offsets. The Python classifier then compares raw Git blob bytes
outside those offsets. The selector must occur exactly once in the head and at most once in the
base, so a newly added element is valid. ID matching follows HTML quirks-mode ASCII case folding;
standards-mode IDs and `data-testid` values remain case-sensitive. The file bytes must change and
its mode must not. Because parse5 does not attach declarative shadow roots, any HTML `template`
carrying `shadowrootmode` fails closed. Its legacy `select` tree construction also differs from
current customizable-select parsing, so every HTML `select` needs an explicit boundary and a second
tokenizer pass rejects child tags outside the narrow syntax both parsers represent consistently.
Never mix page and JSON tool golden families in one change.

Pass an external file directly with `--intent`, or let CI use `--event` to read the pull request
body. Replacements, removals, formatting-only changes, renames, file additions or deletions, stale
declarations, undeclared additions, broad selectors and duplicate JSON keys fail.

**A passing test is not automatically a real test.** The first version of the tool snapshots
wrote 1 byte each, because the hand-built JSON-RPC had an extra `}`. An empty baseline passes
forever. When you add a snapshot, assert it is non-trivial. When you add an assertion, break the
code on purpose and watch it fail before you trust it.

**The fixture is thin.** Its works are single-language, have no trailing full stop in their
titles and no multi-language expressions. Several real defects are therefore unreachable from
the fixture and must be verified against the live site instead.

## Deploying, and why exit codes are not proof

```bash
gh workflow run deploy.yml -f promote=false
gh run watch --repo SFHAJJI/lex
```

The workflow logs into Azure through GitHub OIDC, builds an immutable image, creates a candidate
revision at zero traffic, and verifies artifact manifests, health and MCP behavior against that
revision. It never promotes. Signed assistant evaluation and the separate `revision-traffic`
workflow own promotion, and the former production revision remains available for rollback.

**Then fetch the served output and check it.** A workflow success proves its smoke tests, not
every user path. Check `az containerapp revision list` for `runningState`, then request the live
route and MCP behavior you changed.

## Things that have already gone wrong here

- **Escaping twice.** `PageShell.Page` escapes `title` itself. Callers must pass **plain text**.
  Passing `H(...)` produced `Gro&#223;herzogtums` in the tab and in Google results.
- **`lang` is about the page, not the subject.** A work page is English chrome about a French
  law, so it is `lang="en"`. A version page is 38,000 words of French law, so it is `lang="fr"`.
- **`lastmod` is not `valid_from`.** `valid_from` is when a law takes effect and is legitimately
  years in the future for 23 works. Use `observed_from`.
- **Never diff across extraction profiles.** `pdf-lu/1` and `akn-lu/1` mint different anchor
  schemes, so pairing them reports parser disagreement as legislation. `diff` returns
  `profiles_differ` and refuses. Only when *both* profiles are known and differ.
- **C# raw strings and JSON.** JSON ending in `}}` breaks `$"""`. Build JSON as `JsonObject`
  and call `ToJsonString()`. Never hand-quote it.
- **Git Bash paths.** `mktemp -d` returns `/tmp/...`, which native Windows Python cannot open.
  Pipe through stdin, or use `C:/...` paths.

## Architecture, briefly

`work → dated consolidation → language expression → format manifestation → file` (JOLux/FRBR).

- `Lex.Index` reads both `lex-index/2` and `lex-index/3`. New builds use version 3: SQLite,
  content-addressed exact text, contentless FTS5 and local semantic vectors. It knows nothing
  about law (F1).
- `Lex.Mcp` is the tool logic, shared by the stdio server and the HTTP endpoint (D27, one MCP
  binary). It never summarises or advises (F10); it returns publisher text or a machine-readable
  refusal.
- `Lex.Web` keeps routing and composition in `Program.cs`. At protected main `820bfb3`, that file
  is 149 lines, not 71; pages live in `*Endpoints.cs` (F14/F15 enforce the split). Re-measure
  before repeating the line count after that commit.
- Packaged index size is release-specific, not a repository constant. The signed
  `lex-artifacts/1` manifest is authoritative for every artifact's exact byte length and SHA-256.
  Deployment fetches these gitignored artifacts from exact signed release tags and fails when a
  required tag or artifact is invalid. A source build deliberately started without fetched
  indexes mounts zero indexes and must answer `no_corpus_mounted`, never `[]`.

## Before a local pipeline run

`git pull` `lex-corpus-lu-legilux`, `lex-corpus-eu-eurlex` and `lex-articles` first.
