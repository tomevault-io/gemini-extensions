A daemon that owns coding-agent sessions and exposes them over HTTP + WS, a
control plane that issues identity and relays every request to them, and a web UI
that supervises all of it from a phone.

**One person, one machine, many agents, and no sandbox.** The daemon runs on your
own machine and spawns agents as children of itself, as you — the same thing that
happens when you type `claude` in a terminal, except that you can be somewhere
else. Several at once, each in its own git worktree, each able to bring up a dev
server and run what it just wrote. Multi-user moved to the control plane: several
people, each with their own machine and a grant on it. The daemon accepts any
token whose `aud` is its own machine id and stops asking who the subject is.

It spawns `claude`, `kimi` or `codex` over ACP (Agent Client Protocol), normalizes
all three into one event union, and puts that behind a network layer built on the
assumption that **clients are unreliable**: a laptop lid closes, a phone drops to
LTE, a tab is discarded. The daemon is the source of truth and the agent must
never notice a client leaving.

Node >= 24, ESM, TypeScript strict. Everything in `src/`, `scripts/` and
`packages/control-plane` runs straight off `tsx` with no build step;
`packages/web` is bundled by Vite, inside the control plane's image — the only
thing here that compiles anything.

**No test framework.** `typecheck`, `authcheck`, `daemoncheck`, `relaycheck`,
`webcheck`, `pincheck`, `deploycheck`, `docscheck`, `imagecheck` and `harness`
are the whole automated safety net, and they are drivers rather than unit tests
on purpose. Eight run offline in one process with no fleet, no agent and no
deploy — `docscheck` is the newest and the only one whose subject is prose: it
holds this file to a budget, because the last time it was cut nothing checked
the result and it was larger six days later.
`harness` drives a real agent and needs a login CI cannot hold. `imagecheck`
builds and starts a container, so it is a separate CI job — and it earns that:
the control plane reaches into the repository root for a file list written down
**twice**, in `.dockerignore` and in `deploy/docker/Dockerfile`'s COPY lines, and
an import missing from either passes `typecheck` and all seven other drivers while
breaking only the image. Measured while adding `src/http.ts`: missing from
`.dockerignore` it fails at COPY with `"/src/http.ts": not found` (the build
context never carried it), and missing from the Dockerfile it fails later with
`Cannot find module`. Adding an import means editing both.

Deploying is a *separate* act from checking, and nothing does it on a push.

                                     #   restart budget — plus what an update keeps and what a failed
                                     #   one puts back, and the two surfaces a plugin draws on: every
                                     #   block and every field kind on each, always in pairs, and the

pnpm webcheck                        # packages/web: the cursor, rotation, replay, the tail,

                                     #   against cpctl's own function body. Plus the transcript's
                                     #   two newest rules: what a diff says (hunks, the counts,
                                     #   the LCS bound, and the refusal to draw one over an event

                                     #   never a permission, never a subagent, never one call.
                                     #   And the import flow: that an old daemon is known by the
                                     #   shape of its refusal rather than by its version, and that
                                     #   the export skill asks for what the extractor accepts. And
                                     #   where a plugin's settings are — their own screen, scoped to
                                     #   the machines somebody ticked and carrying them in the URL,
                                     #   narrowed to three controls, drawn with this app's own picker
                                     #   rather than the platform's — read off the files that place
                                     #   them, since nothing typed can hold a placement. Plus the
                                     #   machine table those machines are ticked on: what one row may
                                     #   offer and what the bar may, both swept; that the bar sits
                                     #   outside the scroller and the scroller ends no scroll chain;
                                     #   and what N settings panes add up to when they disagree
                                     #   And the newest: that a transcript missing its beginning
                                     #   *says so* — `transcriptNotice` as a total partition over
                                     #   720 states, its pair with `loadStop`, and the one string
                                     #   feeding both the line and the live region — plus a retry

```

State lives in one SQLite file (`REEMOAT_DB`, default `~/.reemoat/reemoat.db`)
and each session gets its own git worktree under `~/.reemoat/worktrees/…`. A
daemon restart leaves every session it did not stop on purpose `interrupted` and
puts an agent back on each by itself — see `.claude/rules/daemon-sessions.md`.

**The daemon's config is env only** (`.env.example`; the client's
`REEMOAT_URL`/`REEMOAT_MACHINE` are printed by `pnpm client` with their live
values). `REEMOAT_TOKEN` is required.

The control plane lives in `packages/control-plane`, with its own SQLite and
entry point. It signs tokens, holds users, machines and grants, mints single-use
enrollment codes, and relays. **Nothing in `src/` may ever import from it.**

## What is not confined

`REEMOAT_AUTH` decides *who* is asking. Nothing decides what they can reach.

**An agent runs as you.** It is a child of this process, with your uid, your
`HOME`, your files, your `~/.ssh`, your browser profile and your other
repositories. `cwd` is not confined, `REEMOAT_ROOTS` narrows the directory
*picker* and nothing else, and the ACP `fs` capabilities are granted because
declining them would confine nothing — the agent could make the same read itself.

That is the trade every coding agent on a laptop already makes. What this daemon
adds is that it can be driven from a phone, over a relay, by anybody holding a
grant on the machine.

**Codex confines itself, and that is codex's doing rather than a feature of this
daemon.** Measured 2026-08-07: a codex session runs its commands under a sandbox
(`CODEX_SANDBOX=seatbelt` on macOS) with the network off, and its default `agent`
mode escalates to a `session/request_permission` when a command needs more —
which is how the permission machinery gets exercised at all wherever
`~/.claude/settings.json` blanket-allows Bash. Nothing here asks for that and
nothing here can rely on it: it is a per-agent default, `agent-full-access` is one
of the three modes the session offers, and the paragraph above is still the
honest description of what the daemon guarantees, which is nothing.

Three specifics, each a measurement before it was a policy, each of which reads
as a bug if you find it without this section:

**The agent inherits this process's environment.** `agentEnv()` strips the
session-scoped `CLAUDE_*` names and everything `REEMOAT_*`, and that is
**hygiene, not a fence** — the agent runs as this uid and can read
`/proc/<pid>/environ`, the env file and `REEMOAT_DB` itself. What the strip
prevents is three accidents: an agent running `env` and pasting the output into a
transcript; an agent running `pnpm daemon` and colliding on the daemon lock; and
`REEMOAT_TOKEN` reaching a subagent's context window.

**Git hooks run as you, and that is the intent.** `GIT_NO_EXEC_CONFIG` is
deleted, so `git worktree add` runs the repository's own `post-checkout` and its
LFS smudge filters. Cloning a hostile repository is exactly as dangerous here as
in your own terminal — and no more. Neutralising it cost a silent failure: a
blanked `GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL` checks out LFS pointer files instead of content.

**A plugin also runs as you, and it is somebody else's code.** It is a child
process of this daemon with your uid and your files — the same trade the agent
makes, arriving by a different door. `manifest.scopes` is declared, shown at
install and refused when exceeded, and that is **hygiene, not a fence**: the child
can `import("node:fs")`. What it buys is a named blast radius, a hang that cannot
take the daemon's event loop, and a plugin that never holds the daemon's token.
The one real boundary is that **the browser executes none of it** — a plugin sends
a description and the app draws it, so the origin holding `reemoat.credential`
runs nothing a plugin author wrote. `docs/PLUGINS.md` is the author's document;
Q1.612 is the argument.

**`~/.claude/settings.json` can bypass the permission machinery entirely.** Where
it blanket-allows `Bash`, `Edit` or `Write`, the inner CLI decides for itself and
the permission state machine never sees a request — so a permission path that
looks untested may simply never have been reached. Test it with `kimi`, or an
isolated `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`.
The settings screen now **reads that file and says so**, because a switch below
called "ask me every time" is a lie next to a config that already answered.

If a sandbox is wanted again, the seam is `SessionRuntime` — kept as an interface
with one implementation for exactly that reason.

## Pushing

There is no forge feature. An agent pushes with your `~/.gitconfig`, your
credential helper and your keys, exactly as you would — `GIT_NO_EXEC_CONFIG` had
to go for that to be true, since it cleared `credential.helper` and
`core.sshCommand` on every invocation. Whether that is right or alarming is the
same answer as everything in **What is not confined**.

## Where the rest of this lives

The rest of this file is in `.claude/rules/`, one file per area, each scoped by
`paths:`. **A rule arrives when a file matching its globs is read, and it does not
come back after `/compact`.** So if you are planning without opening anything, or
the conversation has been compacted, read the rule for the area you are in before
deciding anything. The third column is a list of questions, never their answers —
the answers are only in the rule, which is what keeps this table from becoming a
second copy that drifts.

Dependencies point one way: `server` → `registry` → `session` → `acp/*`, with
`events.ts` as the shared vocabulary underneath.

The invariants are spread across these by subject, and they are load-bearing: each
was a real defect before it was a rule, and **none is enforced by the compiler**.

**Keeping this file small is `docscheck`'s job, not a preference.** It fails the
build past a ceiling this file deliberately does not restate — the number lives in
`scripts/docscheck.ts` and is read from there, for the reason `SETTING_KEYS`
already gives one section down. What belongs here is what is true wherever you are
working; a measurement, a post-mortem or a correction belongs in
`docs/DECISIONS.md`, and the last time that rule had no check the file tripled in
six days.

## Conventions

Relative imports end in `.js`; builtins use the `node:` prefix; type-only imports
use `import type` (`verbatimModuleSyntax` is on). Stateful classes use a private
constructor plus a static async factory (`Session.start`, `AcpClient.launch`);
teardown is returned as an unsubscribe function; idempotent shutdown is
`this.x ??= this.doX()`. Validation is hand-written — no zod.

**Nothing in `src/` writes to stdout or stderr**, with two sanctioned exceptions.
`store/sqlite.ts`'s v6 migration prints when it destroys something (a dropped
forge account, a collapsed credential, sessions cut by a cap that used to be
per-person). Those happen inside `openStores`, before any callback the daemon
could have wired, so it is the only moment anybody can be told. And
`src/plugins/runner.ts` is the *child* process's entry point rather than the daemon's:
its `unhandledRejection` handler writes to the stderr `runtime.ts` already
captures into the ring shown on the plugin's failure row, which is the whole of
what a process holding none of the daemon's callbacks can say. Everything else
reports through an injected callback (`onDegraded`, `onWarning`); only `scripts/`
print.

An empty `catch` always carries a comment saying why. **Comments explain *why*,
often naming the empirical behaviour that motivated the code** — and a correction
belongs at the code it is about, not in this file.

## Next

Deferred work, open decisions and the inventory of what is asserted are group
**Q7** of `docs/DECISIONS.md` ("Open questions and deliberate non-goals"). The
short version of what is knowingly not built: no sandbox (the seam is
`SessionRuntime`), no end-to-end
encryption through the relay (the seam is `reemoat-enc: none` on the CONNECT
handshake), no fleet rollout, no access log on the control plane, and
no `@file` mentions, and **nothing says a background task is still running** — the
spawn is on the wire (`run_in_background`) and its *end* is on no wire at all, so
counting the starts would buy a row nothing could honestly take down (Q7.113).
**The daemon still has no registry** — it discovers nothing and polls
nothing — but there *is* a market, and the half of Q7.104 that survived is which
process reads it: a catalogue on its own host, read **by the browser**, with
`POST /plugins/source` handing the daemon a repository and a pinned commit. A
machine still installs only what somebody named it on. And no plugin draws in the
transcript or adds a slash command, both with their seams written down rather than
half-built (Q7.105). **CD stops half-way on purpose**: nothing deploys on a push,
and the one automated path is a manual `workflow_dispatch` that deploys the
*control plane* only, refuses a commit whose `check` run is not green, and calls
`deploy/ci-deploy.sh` rather than reimplementing it. **The daemon is still
refused** — recreating one interrupts every turn in flight and drops every pending
approval on the machine you also develop on, which is the half of the old "no CD"
reason that never expired (Q7.94). **Q7.61 is closed by deletion rather than by
measurement** — it asked whether an admin password reset should burn the
account's enrollment codes, and there is no admin password reset any more; the
mailed reset that replaced it deliberately leaves codes alone, because proving
control of your own address is not evidence that a daemon you enrolled is
compromised. **Q7.62 is closed too, and by the plugin work rather than by a
measurement** — it asked whether the upload route's body-cancel discipline
survived the auth and scope middlewares above it, and the answer was that the
handlers were never the gap: the middlewares were. The cancel now hangs off the
`isStreamingRoute` exemption that creates the obligation, so all three streaming
routes inherit both halves and Q7.96 closes with it.

Three are open because the *measurement* is missing rather than the code, and all
three are settled by the same run: one real device-code login on
macOS from a signed-out agent. Whether BSD `script` survives a 15-minute flow with
`/dev/null` on stdin, which is what `loginStdio`'s macOS fix rests on and which is
measured only as far as the spawn succeeding (Q7.63). What those flows actually
print, since `ui/login.ts`'s device-code patterns are conservative guesses while
its one failure string is measured — the fallback makes a miss cost the old screen
rather than a blank one (Q7.64). And whether `codex login --with-api-key`, which
exists and reads stdin, closes the gap recorded at `AGENT_LOGIN.codex`, where a
pasted `CODEX_API_KEY` reaches the model's API and still leaves `session/new`
answering -32000 (Q7.65).

Agents are a **three**-member union now, and adding the third answered the
question Q7.31 was holding open — not by refactoring the type, but by finding that
the work is per-agent measurement rather than per-agent code. Codex cost one arm in
`resolveAgent`, one row in `AGENT_LOGIN`, one arm in `vendoredCli`, one literal in
`wire.ts`'s hand-mirrored union, and a second entry in `pincheck`'s adapter list;
everything else — questions, permissions, commands, config, resume, context usage
— arrived through capabilities that were already read by `category` and by shape
rather than by name. What each new agent *does* cost is the measuring: the two
fields that were wrong on the first attempt (`OPENAI_API_KEY`, and reading a status
command's stdout) were both facts about a CLI that no amount of type work would
have surfaced. A registry is still not built, and the reason is now weaker than it
was: what would justify one is a fourth agent, not a cleaner second.
