# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to Codex (Codex.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

RaceIQ is a full-stack racing telemetry analysis app for Forza Motorsport 2023, F1 25, Assetto Corsa Competizione, Assetto Corsa Evo, and iRacing. UDP and native Windows telemetry sources feed a Bun server, SQLite storage, and a React dashboard. See [architecture overview](docs/architecture/overview.md).

## Commands

```bash
# Development (starts both server and client)
bun run dev

# Server only (Bun with --watch, port 3117)
bun run dev:server

# Client only (Vite with portless)
bun run dev:client

# Tests (Bun test runner)
bun run test                        # use bun run test, not bun test (sets --timeout 60000)
bun test --timeout 60000 test/parser.test.ts   # single test file

# Database
bun run db:push       # sync Drizzle schema to SQLite (dev introspection only — see note below)
bun run db:generate   # generate Drizzle migration files (not used at runtime — see note below)

# Production build (client bundle + compiled server binary → dist/)
bun run build

# Run production build
bun run start

# Build Windows installer
bun run build:installer

# Client-specific
cd client && bun run build   # production build (tsc + vite)
cd client && bun run lint    # ESLint

# Dump mode (develop without a running game — captures raw packets)
bun run dev:dump:fm            # dump Forza Motorsport packets
bun run dev:dump:f1            # dump F1 2025 packets
bun run dev:dump:acc           # dump ACC packets

# AI development (Mastra agent playground)
bun run mastra:studio          # Studio UI (localhost:3000) reading the running dev server's in-process Mastra API (:3117)

# Utility scripts
bun run extract:tracks         # extract track data from game files
bun run laps:export            # export lap data
bun run laps:import            # import lap data
bun run lighthouse             # run Lighthouse audit on local dev server
```

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `SERVER_PORT` | `3117` | HTTP/WebSocket server port |
| `UDP_PORT` | `5301` | Game telemetry UDP listen port |
| `DATA_DIR` | `./data` | Database and settings directory |

### Development Onboarding Flag

Pass `--onboarding false` to the full development command to skip the Setup
Wizard and open any RaceIQ page directly:

```bash
bun run dev --onboarding false
```

Use `--onboarding true` to force the Setup Wizard, or omit the flag to use the
persisted onboarding state normally. The server-side override is development
only and does not change `settings.json`; production builds ignore the flag.

## Architecture

### Three-layer monorepo: `server/`, `client/`, `shared/`

**Server (Bun + Hono)**
- `server/index.ts` — Thin executable entry; `server/runtime/boot.ts` owns ordered startup
- `server/runtime/udp-listener.ts` — UDP socket listening for game telemetry packets
- `server/games/` — Game-owned parsers/adapters plus generic packet dispatch — see [Adding a New Game](#adding-a-new-game)
- `server/routes/index.ts` — Hono app composition; bounded route groups live in `server/routes/`
- `server/runtime/websocket-manager.ts` — WebSocket manager, 30Hz throttled broadcast to all connected clients
- `server/telemetry/live-pipeline.ts` — Telemetry processing pipeline (normalize → suspension fill → lap detect → sector track → pit track → track calibration → broadcast)
- `server/lap-detection/detector.ts` — Detects lap boundaries from telemetry stream (per-game factory via adapter)
- `server/live-strategy/` — Live sector timing and pit/fuel/tire estimates
- `server/lap-analysis/corners.ts` — Game-aware racing-corner identification
- `server/ai/` — AI analysis system (see [AI Analysis System](#ai-analysis-system))
- `server/db/schema.ts` — Drizzle ORM schema (profiles, sessions, laps, corners, lapAnalyses, compareAnalyses, trackOutlines)
- `server/db/*-queries.ts` — Responsibility-scoped database query modules
- `server/db/migrations.ts` — Hand-rolled migration list (SQL array, version-tracked)
- `server/db/index.ts` — Runs migrations on startup via custom runner
- `server/runtime/platform/tray.ts` — System tray integration (Windows)
- `server/runtime/update/check.ts` — Auto-update checker

### Database migration approach

Drizzle is used **only as a query builder and type-safe schema reference** — NOT for runtime migrations. Schema changes are managed via a hand-rolled migration system in `server/db/migrations.ts`. The app compiles to a self-contained Windows binary (`raceiq.exe`); Drizzle's `migrate()` reads SQL files from disk at runtime, which would break single-binary distribution. The custom system embeds all migration SQL directly in the compiled binary.

**To add a schema change:**
1. Edit `server/db/schema.ts` (keeps Drizzle types in sync)
2. Add a new entry at the bottom of `server/db/migrations.ts` with the next version number and the raw SQL
3. Do NOT use `bun run db:push` to apply schema changes — it is for dev introspection only and must never drop `schema_migrations` (protected via `tablesFilter` in `drizzle.config.ts`)
4. NEVER edit historical migrations already released. Append a new migration with the next version; editing old migrations breaks production databases.

### Pipeline dependency injection

The pipeline uses `DbAdapter` and `WsAdapter` interfaces for testability:
- Production: `RealDbAdapter` (SQLite), plus a module-level `WsAdapter` delegating to `wsManager`
- Tests: `NullDbAdapter`/`NullWsAdapter` (no-op) or `CapturingDbAdapter`/`CapturingWsAdapter` (record calls)

### AI Analysis System

The AI system uses Mastra agents backed by Codex API with streaming and prompt caching.

**Agents** (`server/ai/agents.ts`):
- Lap Analyst — single-lap breakdown with corner-by-corner analysis
- Compare Engineer — head-to-head lap comparison (inputs-focused)
- Chat Agent — interactive Q&A about laps and comparisons

**Prompt files** (`server/ai/`): `analyst-prompt.ts`, `chat-prompt.ts`, `compare-engineer.ts`, `compare-chat-prompt.ts`, `inputs-compare-prompt.ts`, `corner-data.ts`, `format-tune.ts`

**Mastra directory** (`mastra/`): Agent definitions + the `mastra` instance (LibSQL default store + DuckDB observability). In dev it is mounted **in-process** onto the RaceIQ Hono app under `/studio-api` (see `server/runtime/dev-studio.ts`), so the server is the sole DuckDB writer and `bun run mastra:studio` reads its real traces over HTTP — no second `mastra dev` process, no DuckDB file lock. Excluded from the prod binary via `NODE_ENV` gating.

**Caching**: Analysis results cached in DB (`lapAnalyses` for single laps, `compareAnalyses` for lap pairs with a `kind` discriminator).

**Client (React 19 + Vite + TanStack Router)**
- `client/src/main.tsx` — App entry point
- `client/src/routes/__root.tsx` — Root layout with TanStack Router
- `client/src/routeTree.gen.ts` — Auto-generated route tree (do not edit manually)
- `client/src/stores/telemetry.ts` — Zustand store for WebSocket connection state, current packet, packets/sec, live history arrays
- `client/src/stores/game.ts` — Zustand store for active game context (gameId → route mapping)
- `client/src/stores/ui.ts` — Zustand store for UI state (settings modal, onboarding)
- Key components:
  - `LiveTelemetry.tsx` — Real-time telemetry dashboard
  - `LapAnalyse.tsx` — Lap analysis with corner data
  - `LapComparison.tsx` — Side-by-side lap comparison
  - `TrackMap.tsx` — Track visualization
  - `TelemetryChart.tsx` — Data charting (uplot)
  - `BodyAttitude.tsx` — 3D car orientation (Three.js / React Three Fiber)
  - `AiAnalysisModal.tsx` — AI-powered analysis via Codex API
  - `Settings.tsx` — App settings modal (UDP port, units)
  - `TuneCatalog.tsx` — Vehicle setup tuning

**Shared (`shared/`)**
- `shared/types.ts` — Telemetry packet types, enums, shared interfaces
- `shared/games/` — Game adapter registry and per-game adapters — see [Adding a New Game](#adding-a-new-game)
- `shared/car-data.ts` — Car model ID-to-name mapping (dispatches via game adapter)
- `shared/tracks/` — Track metadata, geometry, guides, and verification data
- `shared/tunes/` — Vehicle setup data (JSON)

### Data Flow

1. Game sends UDP packets → `server/runtime/udp-listener.ts` receives and buffers
2. `server/games/packet-dispatch.ts` auto-detects game via `canHandle()`, then its game-owned parser decodes binary → typed telemetry object
3. `server/lap-detection/detector.ts` tracks lap boundaries, saves completed laps to SQLite
4. `server/runtime/websocket-manager.ts` broadcasts live packet to all WebSocket clients
5. Client `telemetry.ts` Zustand store receives via WebSocket → React components re-render
6. Historical data fetched via REST API (`/api/laps`, `/api/sessions`, etc.)

### Key Conventions

- Path aliases: `@shared/*` → `./shared/*` (server/test), `@/*` → `./src/*` (client only)
- Client proxies `/api` and `/ws` requests to `localhost:3117` via Vite dev server config
- **API calls use Hono RPC**: import `client` from `@/lib/rpc.ts` (typed against `AppType` from `server/routes/index.ts`) — do not use raw `fetch` for API routes
- **gameId travels via `X-Game-Id` header** — not query params or effect-populated stores
- Database file: `data/forza-telemetry.db` (SQLite)
- Settings persisted to: `data/settings.json`
- UI components use shadcn (in `client/src/components/ui/`) with Tailwind CSS v4
- **Theme contract:** client UI must use semantic `text-app-*`, `tracking-app-*`, `bg-*`, `border-*`, and `shadow-*` tokens; do not add arbitrary typography utilities or raw/palette colors. Run `bun test test/theme-contract.test.ts --timeout 60000` after styling changes.
- Client uses TanStack React Query for server state management
- 3D visualizations use React Three Fiber (Three.js wrapper for React)
- **Never fall back to "fm-2023"** when gameId is missing — make gameId required
- ⚠️ **IMPORTANT — NO DYNAMIC IMPORTS.** `await import(...)` is **banned** in this repo. Static imports at the top of the file, always. The *only* exception is a literal platform-specific switch (e.g. a Windows-only native module guarded by `process.platform === "win32"`) where the target genuinely doesn't exist on other platforms — and even then, document the reason inline. "Lazy-load to avoid startup cost", "break a circular dep", or "match the pattern in this file" are **NOT** valid reasons — fix the architecture instead. This rule has repeatedly caused test hangs (234s `isNewer` case) and opaque module-load chains; it is non-negotiable.

### Dependency inspection

- Do not read, search, or inspect `node_modules/` source files. Treat installed dependencies as opaque; use repository code, package manifests, lockfiles, and official upstream documentation when dependency behavior matters.

### Custom Steering Wheels

The steering wheel displayed during live telemetry is file-driven. To add a custom wheel:

1. Place an image in `client/public/wheels/`
2. Supported formats: `.svg`, `.webp`, `.png`, `.jpg`
3. The filename (minus extension) becomes the display name

Example: `client/public/wheels/Logitech G Pro.png` → shows as "Logitech G Pro"

The wheel picker in Settings and Setup Wizard automatically discovers all images in that directory.

### Game Adapter System

The app uses a registry-based adapter pattern to support multiple racing games. Each game provides a `GameAdapter` (shared) and `ServerGameAdapter` (server-only) that encapsulate all game-specific behavior.

**Shared adapter** (`shared/games/types.ts` — `GameAdapter`):
- Identity: `id`, `displayName`, `shortName`, `routePrefix`
- Car/track resolution: `getCarName()`, `getTrackName()`, `getSharedTrackName()`
- Steering config: `steeringCenter`, `steeringRange` (used by corner detection)
- Coordinate system: `coordSystem` (used by track maps)
- Optional metadata: `carClassNames`, `drivetrainNames`

**Server adapter** (`server/games/types.ts` — `ServerGameAdapter`):
- Packet detection: `canHandle(buf)` — quick check if a UDP buffer belongs to this game
- Parsing: `tryParse(buf, state)` — parse buffer into `TelemetryPacket`
- Parser state: `createParserState()` — e.g. F1's multi-packet accumulator (null if stateless)
- AI analysis: `aiSystemPrompt`, `buildAiContext(packets)`

**Registries:**
- `shared/games/registry.ts` — `registerGame()`, `getGame()`, `tryGetGame()`, `getAllGames()`
- `server/games/registry.ts` — `registerServerGame()`, `getServerGame()`, `getAllServerGames()`

**Current adapters:**
- `shared/games/fm-2023/` + `server/games/fm-2023/` — Forza Motorsport 2023
- `shared/games/f1-2025/` + `server/games/f1-2025/` — F1 25
- `shared/games/acc/` + `server/games/acc/` — Assetto Corsa Competizione
- `shared/games/ac-evo/` + `server/games/ac-evo/` — Assetto Corsa Evo
- `shared/games/iracing/` + `server/games/iracing/` — iRacing

### Adding a New Game

Follow the registry and boundary model in [architecture overview](docs/architecture/overview.md). Implement shared and server adapters, register both, then add game-specific parsing, routes, data, and focused tests. Never introduce an implicit fallback game.

### Pre-commit Hooks (Lefthook)

Installed via `postinstall` script. Runs in parallel on staged client files:
- **lint** — ESLint on staged `client/src/**/*.{ts,tsx}`
- **typecheck** — full client build (`cd client && bun run build`)


### Pull Request Creation

When creating or updating a pull request:

1. Review `git status` and the complete diff before opening or updating the PR.
2. Commit every change relevant to the PR, including tests, documentation, configuration, and changelog updates. Do not stop after committing only the initially requested file.
3. Check for related untracked and unstaged files, and include all relevant work in the PR commit.
4. Verify the PR branch has no relevant uncommitted or untracked changes before creating or updating the PR. Leave unrelated local work untouched and call it out explicitly.

### Pull Request Changelog

Every pull request must include a concise bullet in `CHANGELOG.md` under `## Unreleased`. Use `### Internal` for implementation, CI, tooling, and maintenance changes that are not user-visible; keep `### Breaking`, `### Features`, and `### Fixes` for user-facing changes. Run `bun test test/changelog.test.ts --timeout 60000` before requesting review.

### AI Evaluators

Lap Analyst and Compare Engineer outputs are gated by deterministic scorers under `mastra/evals/scorers/`. The eval harness runs real fixture laps through an eval-only agent (pinned to `google/gemini-3-flash`), scores the output, and fails the build if any score drops below its threshold in `mastra/evals/index.ts::SCORER_THRESHOLDS`.

**Scorers (all deterministic, no LLM judge):**
- `output-shape` — analyst output parses against `AnalystOutputSchema` (`server/ai/schemas.ts`). Threshold 1.0.
- `corner-coverage` — fraction of the fixture's expected slowest corners mentioned. Threshold 0.7.
- `numeric-grounding` — fraction of `tuning[]` entries citing a concrete number-with-unit. Threshold 0.8.
- `unit-consistency` — metric fixtures must not leak imperial units, and vice versa. Threshold 1.0.
- `compare-directionality` — compare output correctly names the faster lap. Threshold 0.9.
- `chat-freeform-shape` — chat output is non-empty, cites real corners, no hallucinated corner names. Threshold 0.8.

**Schema source of truth:** every game adapter prompt (FM, F1, ACC, AC Evo) renders its JSON output shape via `renderAnalystSchemaForPrompt()` from `server/ai/schemas.ts`, so the scorer and the model's instructions stay in lockstep. Per-game prompts still own their own category guidelines and domain rules, but the shape is centralised.

**Running evals:**
```
bun run test:ai                  # runs test/ai-quality.test.ts
bun run ai:baseline              # snapshots scores to test/ai-fixtures/baselines/<sha>-<model>.json
```

Both commands require `GEMINI_API_KEY` (or `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY`); they skip cleanly when absent so forks and fresh clones don't flake.

**Adding a fixture:** see `test/ai-fixtures/README.md`. In short: export a real lap via `bun run laps:export --ids <id> -o test/ai-fixtures/packets/<id>.zip`, then add a matching JSON under `test/ai-fixtures/laps/` with an `expected` block pinning _signals_ (corner names, faster lap, setup direction) — not a reference answer. Signals survive prompt iteration; reference answers do not.

**CI:** AI evals are local-dev only. Not gated in CI and not required before shipping.

### Testing

Tests live in `test/` and use Bun's native test runner (`bun:test` with `describe`/`test`/`expect`). Tests that involve packet parsing must initialize game adapters first:

```typescript
import { initGameAdapters } from "../shared/games/init";
import { initServerGameAdapters } from "../server/games/init";

initGameAdapters();
initServerGameAdapters();
```

**Known issue**: ACC shared memory tests fail on macOS due to `@libsql/client` module resolution (Windows-only feature).

### CI/CD

- **PR/main**: GitHub Actions runs `bun test` and client build (`.github/workflows/build-test.yml`)
- **Release tags**: Windows x64 binary compilation via `.github/workflows/release.yml` — Bun compiles server to `raceiq.exe`, bundles with Vite client output into `raceiq-windows-x64.zip`

### Memory

Project memory is stored in `.Codex/memory/` in the repo root (not the default `~/.Codex/projects/` path). This is version-controlled so all contributors share context. Read and write memory files there.

### Documentation

Use [docs landing page](docs/README.md) for maintained documentation, [architecture overview](docs/architecture/overview.md) for system boundaries, and [track curation](docs/contributing/track-curation.md) before changing track metadata or segment geometry.

Respond terse like smart caveman. All technical substance stay. Only fluff die.

Rules:
- Drop: articles (a/an/the), filler (just/really/basically), pleasantries, hedging
- Fragments OK. Short synonyms. Technical terms exact. Code unchanged.
- Pattern: [thing] [action] [reason]. [next step].
- Not: "Sure! I'd be happy to help you with that."
- Yes: "Bug in auth middleware. Fix:"

Switch level: /caveman lite|full|ultra|wenyan
Stop: "stop caveman" or "normal mode"

Auto-Clarity: drop caveman for security warnings, irreversible actions, user confused. Resume after.

Boundaries: code/commits/PRs written normal.
