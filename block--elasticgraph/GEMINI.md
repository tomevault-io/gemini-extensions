# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to AI coding agents when working with code in this repository.
It is tool-neutral and intended to be shared across agent runtimes.

## Memory Bank

- Use `ai-memory/README.md` for durable project context and architecture notes.
- If present, use `ai-memory/PROMPT.md` and `ai-memory/TASKS.md` for active feature/task context.
- Keep memory-bank updates concise and aligned with implemented behavior.

## Project Overview

ElasticGraph is a schema-driven, scalable, cloud-native, batteries-included GraphQL platform backed by Elasticsearch/OpenSearch. It's designed as a modular system with a small core and numerous built-in extensions, organized as a Ruby monorepo containing 20+ gems.

## Common Commands

### Testing
- `script/run_specs` - Run entire test suite (uses flatware for parallelization)
- `script/run_gem_specs [gem_name]` - Run tests for a specific gem (e.g., `elasticgraph-support`)
- `bundle exec rspec [path]` - Run specific test file or directory
- `bundle exec rspec --only-failures` - Run only previously failed tests
- `bundle exec rspec --next-failure` - Run failures one at a time (for iterative debugging)
- `script/flatware_rspec [path]` - Run tests in parallel (faster for large test runs, slower for small subsets)

**Important**: Integration/acceptance tests require a running datastore:
```bash
bundle exec rake elasticsearch:test:boot
# or
bundle exec rake opensearch:test:boot
```

### Build & Validation
- `script/quick_build` - Run abridged CI build (recommended before opening PRs)
- `script/lint` - Run linter (Standard Ruby)
- `script/lint --fix` - Auto-fix linting issues
- `script/type_check` - Run Steep type checker
- `script/spellcheck` - Check spelling (uses codespell)
- `script/spellcheck -w` - Auto-fix spelling issues

### Schema & Artifacts
- `bundle exec rake schema_artifacts:dump` - Regenerate schema artifacts after schema definition changes
- Schema definition files: `config/schema.rb` and `config/schema/*.rb`

### Local Development
- `bundle exec rake boot_locally` - Boot ElasticGraph locally (from a new project)
- `bundle exec rake site:serve` - Serve project website locally at http://localhost:4000/elasticgraph/
- `bundle exec rake site:preview_docs:[gem_name]` - Preview API docs for a specific gem (faster feedback loop)

### Documentation
- API documentation uses YARD
- 100% documentation coverage is required for all public methods and classes.
- Website source: `config/site/`
- Example queries: `config/site/examples/*/queries/`
- When writing links in documentation, use permalinks (links to a specific commit/version)
- Prefer relative links to ElasticGraph documentation over external links to ruby-doc.org

#### Validated Code Snippets in User Guides

One of the website's guiding principles is that **all code snippets in guides must be validated** — pulled from real example projects under `config/site/examples/` rather than hand-written inline in the markdown. This ensures CI catches any future API breakage that would invalidate the docs.

When you add or modify code examples in `config/site/src/guides/*.md`, do this from the start (don't write inline `code='...'` blocks first and migrate later):

1. **Pick or create an example project** under `config/site/examples/<name>/`. Each project needs at minimum:
   - `schema.rb` — schema definition file (validated by `schema_artifacts:dump`)
   - `local_settings.yaml` — points `schema_artifacts.directory` at `config/site/examples/<name>/schema_artifacts`
   - Optional: `queries/<category>/*.graphql` (validated against the schema by the query registry)
   - Optional: additional `.rb` files for snippets that don't need to execute (e.g. `Rakefile`-style examples)
2. **Mark snippet ranges** in the source files with `# :snippet-start: <name>` / `# :snippet-end:` comment fences. The fenced region becomes available as `<example>.snippets.<file>.<name>`. Whole files are also exposed as `<example>.files.<file>`, but **prefer fenced snippets** — they let you keep the standard Block copyright header at the top of the file (and any boilerplate like `schema.json_schema_version 1`) without it leaking into the rendered docs. Trim each snippet to just what's pertinent to the guide.
3. **Reference snippets from markdown** with the data parameter:
   ```
   {% include copyable_code_snippet.html language="ruby" data="<example>.snippets.<file>.<name>" %}
   ```
   Never write inline `code='...'` blocks for guide content — those bypass validation.
4. **Run** `bundle exec rake site:examples:<name>:extract_snippets` to regenerate `config/site/src/_data/<name>.yaml` (this file is gitignored — it gets rebuilt on the fly).
5. **Preview** with `bundle exec rake site:serve` to confirm the snippet renders correctly before opening a PR.

For an end-to-end example, see `config/site/examples/custom_resolver/` and how its snippets are pulled into `config/site/src/guides/custom-graphql-resolvers.md`.

## Architecture

### Monorepo Structure
All gems follow the pattern: `elasticgraph-[name]/` containing:
- `lib/elastic_graph/[name]/` - Source code

## Development Workflow

### Adding Query API Features

When adding filtering predicates or aggregation functions:

1. **Design Phase**: Create GitHub Discussion, research datastore capabilities, design GraphQL API following ElasticGraph's guiding principles
2. **Schema Definition**: Update `SchemaElementNames`, built-in types, and test coverage
3. **Query Translation**: Implement GraphQL → datastore query translation with unit, integration, and acceptance tests
4. **Documentation**: Add user-facing docs with working examples to `config/site/`

### Verification

After completing a chunk of work, run `script/run_specs` and `script/type_check` to verify correctness across all gems and type signatures.

### Test Strategy

Three layers of testing:
- **Unit tests**: Build and inspect `DatastoreQuery` without execution
- **Integration tests**: Build and execute `DatastoreQuery` directly (skips GraphQL layer)
- **Acceptance tests**: End-to-end GraphQL queries with real datastore

### Bundle Management

The repo uses a symlinked `Gemfile` approach:
- Root `Gemfile` defines development, site, and test dependencies
- Each gem has a symlinked `Gemfile` that includes its `.gemspec` and recursively resolves ElasticGraph gem dependencies from the repo

Custom gems can be added via `Gemfile-custom` (see `Gemfile-custom.example`), then run `source script/enable_custom_gemfile`.

## Code Standards

- **Linter**: Standard Ruby (see `.standard.yml`)
- **Type Checker**: Steep (`Steepfile`)
- **Test Framework**: RSpec
- **Coverage**: 100% required (enforced by SimpleCov)
- **Ruby Version**: 3.4.x or 4.0.x
- **Standard Comment Header**: Required on most Ruby files (copyright notice)

### Ruby Idioms

- Prefer `filter_map` over `.select { ... }.map { ... }` chains. For example, instead of:
  ```ruby
  items.select { |item| item.value }.map { |item| item.value }
  ```
  Use:
  ```ruby
  items.filter_map { |item| item.value }
  ```
- Prefer `::Data.define` over `::Struct.new` for immutable data classes. Use `Struct` only when mutability is required.
- Don't rely on exceptions for control flow (exceptions are slow). Handle edge cases explicitly instead (e.g., check for `nil` before calling a method that would raise `ArgumentError`).
- For constants accessed from multiple EG gems, define them in `elasticgraph-support/lib/elastic_graph/constants.rb`.
- Always put a blank space after `#` in comments. This applies to all comments, including RBS type annotation comments (e.g., `# : String` not `#: String`).
- Avoid defensive code for impossible cases. Don't add checks, tests, or handling for scenarios that should never occur due to the design of the system. If something can only happen due to a bug in the implementation, it's better to fail fast than to silently handle it.
- Drop unnecessary namespace prefixes. When code is already inside `module ElasticGraph`, use `Indexer` instead of `::ElasticGraph::Indexer`, and `Errors::ConfigError` instead of `::ElasticGraph::Errors::ConfigError`. Use fully qualified names only when necessary to avoid ambiguity.
- Prefer using `prepend` + `super` rather than `alias_method` when needing to hook in and override a method.

### RBS Type Signatures

- When defining RBS signatures for extension modules, prefer declaring the concrete type a module extends rather than defining custom interfaces. For example, use `module IndexExtension : ::ElasticGraph::SchemaDefinition::Indexing::Index` instead of creating a custom `_IndexExtensionInterface`.
- Place interface methods on the narrowest correct interface. If a method only exists on indexable types, put it on `_IndexableType`, not `_Type`.
- Define `type` aliases (e.g. `type abstractType = InterfaceType | UnionType`) for repeated union types rather than duplicating them across signatures.
- When Steep can't infer a narrowed type from an expression, prefer an inline RBS type annotation comment (e.g. `# : SchemaElements::InterfaceType`) over a `_ =` cast. Use `_ =` only as a last resort when an annotation won't work.
- For `Data.define` blocks where Steep can't type-check the dynamically generated `initialize`, use `# @implements ClassName` with a corresponding `class ClassName < Data` in the RBS file that declares the method signatures. Avoid `__skip__ = def`.
- Prefer `&:method_name` over explicit blocks. If Steep complains, add the missing method to the RBS rather than rewriting as `{ |x| x.method_name }`.
- Keep `@ivar` declarations adjacent to their accessor method in the RBS, not grouped elsewhere.
- Be precise about collection element types in RBS — e.g. if a `Set` only ever contains `UnionType`, type it as `Set[UnionType]` not `Set[UnionType | InterfaceType]`.
- Use `@dynamic` annotations only for methods that actually exist at runtime (provided by delegation, Struct, or included modules). Never use `@dynamic` for methods that would raise `NoMethodError`.

### Testing

- Avoid duplicate tests. If two tests will always pass/fail together, keep only one.
- Use `expect_to_return_non_nil_values_from_all_attributes` to test wrapper classes (like `WarehouseLambda`, `GraphQL`, `Indexer`, etc.). This automatically exercises every zero-argument method and verifies all dependencies are built successfully.
- Use the `:capture_logs` RSpec tag instead of logger test doubles for verifying log output. Access logs with `logged_jsons_of_type(message_type)`.
- Use `build_*` helper methods from `spec/support/builds_*.rb` to construct test objects. These helpers provide sensible defaults while allowing selective overrides for testing specific scenarios.

## Important Patterns

### Schema Definition

- When referencing derived type names (e.g. filter input types), never hardcode names like `"StringFilterInput"`. Always use `schema_def_state.type_ref("String").as_filter_input.name` (or similar `as_*` methods on type references). Hardcoded names break when schema element names are customized (e.g. camelCase schemas).

### Schema Artifacts
After schema definition changes, always run:
```bash
bundle exec rake schema_artifacts:dump
```

This updates:
- Generated GraphQL schema
- Datastore mappings
- Runtime metadata
- Datastore scripts (including auto-updating `INDEX_DATA_UPDATE_SCRIPT_ID` constant)

### Datastore Configuration
Test datastore ports configured in `config/settings/test.yaml.template`. The `Rakefile` automatically clears `ClusterConfigurationManager` state files when booting test datastores.

### Flatware Parallelization
Tests run in parallel via flatware when beneficial. The build scripts automatically determine when to use it based on test suite size.

## Troubleshooting

- **Datastore in bad state**: Kill and restart `rake [elasticsearch|opensearch]:test:boot`
- **Schema artifact issues**: Run `rake schema_artifacts:dump` twice if updating `update_index_data.painless` script
- **Memory resets between datastore boots**: The `boot_prep_for_tests` task clears `ClusterConfigurationManager` state files
