# abcTrain — notes for a coding session

One app and three plugins in one CMake build (ADR 041): **abcTrain** (the
`EarTrainer` target, standalone only — nine listening exercises on a
3-down/1-up staircase, plus a Studio tab that runs the Learners inside the
app) and **ABC Learner EQ / Comp / Verb** (VST3/AU — real processors that
teach while you use them). Vendor `soundkorb`. Product names begin with `ABC`; CMake
targets and folders keep the short forms (`EarTrainer`, `LearnerEQ/`).
Renaming a product changes its VST3/AU id and breaks saved host projects —
don't.

The person who owns this is a practising sound engineer. **Answer in
Russian.** He values direct criticism and explanation through
understanding.

## Where things are

| | |
|---|---|
| [docs/orientation.md](docs/orientation.md) | the map, the load-bearing ideas, **the rules from the literature** — read first |
| [docs/code-map.md](docs/code-map.md) | per-file breakdown (was the body of this file) — read the part you change |
| [docs/decisions/](docs/decisions/) | ADRs, 001–047: why each shape was chosen |
| [docs/process.md](docs/process.md) | how a task goes from idea to release; the scenario checklist |
| [docs/research/](docs/research/) | the literature review every current proposal rests on |
| [docs/design/](docs/design/) | sound library, education/live, the redesign spec |
| [docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md) | direction in broad strokes |
| public board | GitHub Project «abcTrain»; `tools/board/cards.json` + `create_board.py` |
| [docs/wiki/](docs/wiki/) | the user manual (EN + RU), mirrored to the GitHub wiki |

Concrete tasks live on the board, not in this file.

## Build and check

```
cmake -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
ninja -C build EarTrainerTests && ./build/EarTrainerTests_artefacts/Release/EarTrainerTests
ninja -C build ClickMap EditorSnapshots
xvfb-run -a ./build/ClickMap_artefacts/Release/ClickMap
SNAP_DARK=1 SNAP_SIZE=1100x780 xvfb-run -a ./build/EditorSnapshots_artefacts/Release/EditorSnapshots <dir>
```

- Build targets separately in the cloud container (two cores, LTO): a full
  `ninja` does not fit in ten minutes. Configure once, then incremental.
- `EditorSnapshots` renders every screen to PNG — the only way to see a
  layout from the container. **Look at the picture before saying a visual
  change works** (skill `juce-editor-render-check`).
- `ClickMap` checks that every control a screen shows can be clicked, that
  every Studio plugin opens again after switching, and that a page from the
  top bar silences the exercise.
- **Text:** never `g.drawText` / `g.drawFittedText` directly — use
  `AbcTrainLookAndFeel::fitText` / `fitLines` (they shrink before they cut).
  `TEXT_AUDIT=1` on EditorSnapshots lists every line that still does not fit;
  run it on all 12 languages before calling a screen done.
- `tests/RealtimeSafetyTest` enforces the audio-thread rule below.
- `EarTrainerTests <name>` runs one test (or category). `GoldenAudio`
  compares each plugin's output with `tests/golden/*.flac`; a change that is
  *meant* to change the sound regenerates them (`GOLDEN_WRITE=1`) and says
  why in the commit. `REVERB_REPORT=1 … ReverbCharacter` prints what every
  reverb knob measurably does.
- Bots: `python3 tools/bots/train_bots.py` regenerates `Source/BotWeights.h`
  (never edit that by hand).

## Structure (ADR 039, 040)

```
shared/ui/        abc_ui        theme, look-and-feel, fonts, icons, widgets, window fit
shared/analysis/  abc_analysis  spectrum, waveform, meters, vectorscope     → ui
shared/audio/     abc_audio     library + packs, slicer, beds, generators   → (nothing)
shared/dsp/       abc_dsp       reverb, compressor, EQ coefficients (header-only)
shared/learning/  abc_learning  modules, lessons, Learner editor base, A/B  → ui analysis audio dsp updates
shared/updates/   abc_updates   version, update check                       → ui
shared/i18n/      abc_i18n      localisation (12 languages)
Source/Games + managers         abc_trainer_engine — the nine exercises and their rules, no GUI
Learner*/Source (no PluginEntry) abc_learner_eq/comp/verb, abc_learners — plugins and the app's Studio
```

- Includes from the repository root: `#include "shared/dsp/ReverbEngine.h"`.
- A new shared `.cpp` goes in its group's `target_sources` once. A new
  exercise goes in `abc_trainer_engine` **and is appended** to
  `GameManager`'s list (progress is keyed by index).
- Nothing in `shared/` includes `Source/` or `Learner*/`. `Source/` may
  include `Learner*/Source/` (the Studio) — never a `PluginEntry.cpp`.
- One engine per effect: the trainer and the plugins run the same DSP.
  Don't add a second reverb or compressor.

## Rules that are not up for silent change

- **Audio thread** (ADR 038): inside `processBlock` and anything it calls —
  no allocation, lock, file I/O, `String` building, `ValueTree` edit, GUI
  call or wait. Data leaves through atomics or lock-free FIFOs.
- **Answer mechanics:** no "Submit" button in the trainer; moving the scale
  never plays the answer (literature: ISA vs ICA — see orientation.md).
- **Answer names and technical parameter names are not translated**
  (Room, Plate, Low-mids; Threshold, Ratio, Attack, Pre-delay, Q, Bell,
  Low shelf, Bypass) and neither are the English family names under
  headings — they are the words on real plugins. Explanations around
  them are translated.
- **The hint region in "Guess the Band" stays three bands wide**
  (`tests/HintTest` holds it).
- **Level is never the tell:** every exercise matches loudness on the
  material actually playing.
- **Numbers agree with their words:** write `{{n}} [[раунд|раунда|раундов]]`
  (forms in CLDR order: one|few|many for ru/uk/pl, one|other for the rest,
  one form for ja/ko/zh). `fitText`/`fitLines` and `getText(key, map)` pick
  the form from the number just before (`tests/PluralTest`).
- **Every string in all 12 languages** (`shared/i18n/strings/*.json`); the
  tests check that each table has every English key.
- **Offline-first:** no account, no server, no telemetry in anything
  installed. The one request the app makes on its own is the release
  list for the update check, and it has a switch in Settings (ADR 042).
  Live (seminars, battles) is a separate deployable; the app connects to
  it only when the player opens Live himself. A local seminar (ADR 047)
  opens a listening socket on the local network only while the presenter
  has a room open. Signing in is optional
  (ADR 045): a signed-in app syncs a ~1 KB progress summary, and that
  sync has its own switch. Battles against bots (ADR 046) need no network.
- **Learner modules have no hearing check** (ADR 041): watch → try → Done.
  Naming a setting by ear is the trainer's job.
- **Sound packs:** only CC0 / PD / CC BY / CC BY-SA / written permission,
  with an author (`ReferenceAudioLibrary::isAllowedLicense`,
  `tools/library/build_pack.py`). Never bundle audio of unknown licence.

## Working with the user's Mac

- The cloud container **cannot push** to GitHub. The user pushes from his
  Mac (`~/Desktop/work/abcTrain/repo`).
- Move work to the Mac as a patch: commit in the container,
  `git format-patch -1 HEAD`, commit the file to the Mac, `git am --3way`,
  then compare `git rev-parse HEAD^{tree}` on both sides. Deleting files on
  the Mac needs `device_request_delete_permission` (git's `index.lock`
  counts).
- A path reused in `/mnt/user-data/outputs` can be served stale to the Mac:
  give each transfer a new file name and check `md5sum` on both sides.
- Building on the Mac: if CMake cannot rewrite an `.app` in `build/`
  (macOS app-management permission), build into a fresh directory.

## Conventions

- JUCE house style (`if (x)`, space before parens).
- Commit messages in Russian, prose: what was wrong and why it is solved
  this way. A decision that changes the shape of the product gets an ADR.
- APVTS for per-instance plugin parameters; `PropertiesFile` for per-user
  progress. Don't mix them.
