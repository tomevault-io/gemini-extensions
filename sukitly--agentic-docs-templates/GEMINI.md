# AGENTS.md

## Communication Rules

Your reader is a senior engineer with full context on the project. They do not need background, encouragement, or restatements of what they just said.

1. **No repetition.** State each conclusion once. Do not rephrase the same point.
2. **Skip obvious reasoning.** If evidence directly implies a conclusion, give the conclusion. Do not walk through steps unless the chain is non-obvious.
3. **Use tables for structured comparison, not prose.** Bad: "A is high because X. B is medium because Y." Good: a markdown table with columns `Item | Decision | Reason`.
4. **No decorative formatting.** Do not use horizontal rules, box-drawing characters, or headers on every paragraph. Use headers only when sections genuinely need separation.
5. **Conclusion first.** Lead with the decision / conclusion / action item, then supporting evidence.
6. **No meta-narration.** Do not say "if you agree, reply X and I will start." Do not narrate what you are about to do. Either do it, or propose it.
7. **Density check.** Ask yourself: "if I cut half of this, would the information content stay the same?" If yes, cut.
8. **Concrete references.** When referring to a module, file, component, variable, plan, or concept, write the concrete name. Avoid vague references like "it", "this", "that one", "the previous one", or temporary labels across messages.
9. **Anti-quota principle for report-style output.** When asked to produce findings / issues / risks / suggestions / alternatives, report only what you actually found. Empty lists are valid. Specifically forbidden:
   - Inventing severity buckets or forcing every bucket to contain something
   - Choosing from fixed options when reality falls outside the options
   - Filler rows like "no issues found in category X"
   - Giving an overall judgment when there are no findings
   - Promoting uncertain nits into issues so the report looks productive

   Distinction: enumerating internal state ("what decisions did I make") is bounded and required; filling external categories ("list one issue in each failure mode") encourages hallucinated bucket-filling.

## UI/UX Rules

- Express information through UI structure, hierarchy, state, affordance, disabled/loading/selected/empty states, and direct manipulation. Do not compensate for an unclear interaction model with explanatory copy. Copy is for labels, errors, confirmations, and necessary accessibility support.

## ⛔ Hard Rules (Must follow on every task, no exceptions)

> **Task starting frame.** Your role is not to ship code — it is to find the right abstraction. If the right abstraction requires changing 10 files, change 10 files. If you can only determine the abstraction by asking, ask first. "Ship fast" is not the goal; "produce something that holds up 6 months from now" is.

1. **STOP — do not write code directly.** After receiving any development task, first read the relevant docs from the Repository Knowledge Map below.
2. **Docs before code when criteria are met.** If the task requires a Design Doc or Exec Plan, create the doc and get user confirmation before coding.
3. **Plan before execute.** Present what files you plan to change, why, and how. Wait for explicit user approval before making changes.
4. **Self-review + doc sync after completion.** After code changes, run the Pre-delivery Self-review checklist, then update affected docs. Skipping either step means the task is incomplete.
5. **Tests first.** When working on core business logic, write tests first, confirm they fail, then implement.
6. **No "minimal runnable loop" feature delivery.** For real feature work, implement the final user-facing path. Do not deliver scaffolding, mock backends, placeholders, or dual-path transition code unless the user explicitly asks for a prototype/spike/placeholder.
7. **No "minimum viable / shortest path" solutions.** The proposal must target the complete form of the goal. If you catch yourself trimming requirements for convenience, stop and return to the complete proposal.
8. **No mid-flight checks during Exec Plan execution.** During Exec Plan execution, do not use phase-by-phase lint/test/typecheck/build as acceptance gates. Acceptance happens once after the whole plan is implemented.
9. **No code written only to pass checks.** Do not add placeholder implementations, empty branches, `@ts-ignore`, `eslint-disable`, generic catch-all wrappers, or coverage-only tests to make checks pass. Fix the design instead.
10. **No silent decisions.** Any Design Doc, Exec Plan, or non-trivial change proposal must contain a `## Decisions Made Without Asking` section listing: (a) decisions made without asking the user; (b) whether the choice was made because it is the right abstraction or merely the smallest change. If the reason is smallest change / convenience, stop and ask. Enumerate decisions themselves; do not fabricate alternatives just to fill a comparison table.
11. **No minimum-diff thinking.** Before implementing, answer: "is this the smallest-diff approach, or the right-abstraction approach?" If they differ, choose the right abstraction and explain why the smallest diff is wrong.

> Violating any of the above = failure. Better to ask one more question than to skip documentation.

<!-- CUSTOMIZE: Define project-specific testing rules and conventions here. -->

Detailed testing strategy: [docs/TESTING.md](docs/TESTING.md)

### TDD Discipline (Agent-enforced)

For any task involving core business logic, follow Red → Green → Refactor:

1. **Write tests first** based on the Design Doc / Exec Plan / approved conversation plan behavioral contract
2. **Confirm red**: run tests and confirm they fail for the intended reason
3. **Implement** the final product code required by the spec
4. **Refactor** once tests pass

<!-- CUSTOMIZE: Define which scenarios are exempt from strict TDD, if any. -->

### Test-to-Spec Traceability

Test file headers should reference the associated spec source:

```ts
/**
 * @spec docs/design-docs/xxx.md — P1, P3, B1, B2
 */
```

For no-doc tasks, reference the issue/PR/conversation plan if your test framework supports file-level comments.

## Development Workflow

### Document-Driven Principle (Mandatory)

> Knowledge the agent cannot see does not exist. Durable decisions, proposals, and context must live in `docs/`, not only in conversation or memory.

**Before starting a task:** read the relevant docs from the Repository Knowledge Map.

**After completing a task:** update docs according to the Doc Sync Matrix.

#### Doc Sync Matrix

| Trigger Event | Must check / update |
|---|---|
| **Exec Plan completed** | [STATE.md](docs/STATE.md), [exec-plans/index.md](docs/exec-plans/index.md) (move plan to `completed/`), [knowledge-base.md](docs/product-specs/knowledge-base.md) if product behavior changed, [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) if architecture changed |
| **Design Doc adopted** | [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) if architecture changed; record in [DECISIONS.md](docs/DECISIONS.md) only if the decision crosses the Design Doc boundary |
| **Product feature added/changed** | [knowledge-base.md](docs/product-specs/knowledge-base.md), [STATE.md](docs/STATE.md) |
| **Architecture/layering changed** | [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) |
| **Technical decision made without a carrying doc** | [DECISIONS.md](docs/DECISIONS.md), after applying the admission criteria in that file |
| **New infrastructure/dependency/deployment target introduced** | [STATE.md](docs/STATE.md), [DEPLOYMENT.md](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md), [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) |
| **New design proposal** | Create a doc in `docs/design-docs/` using [design-doc.md](docs/templates/design-doc.md), update [design-docs/index.md](docs/design-docs/index.md) |
| **New execution plan** | Create a doc in `docs/exec-plans/active/` using [exec-plan.md](docs/templates/exec-plan.md), update [exec-plans/index.md](docs/exec-plans/index.md) |
| **New tech debt discovered** | [TECH_DEBT.md](docs/TECH_DEBT.md), after applying the admission criteria in that file |
| **New product gap / deferred decision / operational follow-up discovered** | [BACKLOG.md](docs/BACKLOG.md), after applying the admission criteria in that file |

**STATE.md update rule:** `STATE.md` is a current-state snapshot. Update the affected section in place. Do not append changelog entries, plan-by-plan history, or progress logs.

**Cross-reference rule:** When updating any document, check whether related documents also need syncing. Documents are never updated in isolation.

**Index maintenance:** After adding or moving any doc under `docs/`, update the corresponding `index.md`.

**When to create a Design Doc — default: do not create one.** Create a Design Doc only when both conditions are true:

- The change is materially significant: new module/subsystem, module boundary or dependency direction change, data model or external contract change, new external dependency choice, or user-visible interaction model redesign
- There are at least two real approaches with different structural consequences, and choosing wrong would cause multi-file or irreversible rework

Do **not** create a Design Doc for single-component UI adjustments, copy/parameter/threshold changes, implementation-path-obvious features, bug fixes, or single-point performance fixes.

**When to create an Exec Plan — default: do not create one.** Create an Exec Plan only when any condition is true:

- Cross-package or cross-service cutover with ordering dependencies and an unsafe intermediate state
- Database migration or other irreversible change
- Multi-PR / multi-session work that needs durable resume state

A change touching many files is not by itself an Exec Plan trigger if the work can be completed safely in one PR.

**Document Naming Conventions:**

| Document Type | Format | Location | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| Design Doc | `D{number}-{kebab-case-description}.md` | `docs/design-docs/` | `D1-auth-flow.md` |
| Exec Plan | `E{number}-{kebab-case-description}.md` | `docs/exec-plans/active/` | `E1-db-migration.md` |

- The number must increment from the corresponding `index.md`
- The description must be short kebab-case
- Completed Exec Plans move from `active/` to `completed/` without renaming

**No doc needed:** bug fixes, style/copy tweaks, single-PR features, and localized refactors that do not hit the criteria above. "No doc needed" does not mean "no plan needed": Hard Rule #3 and Hard Rule #10 still apply, with the conversation or PR description as the carrier.

### Self-Rationalization Check (Agent self-check)

| If you are thinking... | The reality is... |
|---|---|
| "This is simple; no process needed" | Simple changes are where assumptions break most easily |
| "I already know how it works" | Verify with evidence |
| "TDD is too heavy for this fix" | Simple code breaks too |
| "I will update docs later" | Later does not happen; update docs now |
| "Just change these two lines" | This is minimum-diff thinking; check the abstraction first |
| "This decision is not important" | Importance is the user's call; list the decision for review |

### Pre-delivery Self-review (Mandatory)

After code is written and CI passes, show the checklist results to the user.

**Spec Alignment Check:**

- [ ] Every postcondition in the behavioral contract has a corresponding test
- [ ] Every scenario in the edge case catalog has a corresponding test
- [ ] Implementation behavior is described in the spec, or the spec was updated

**Test Quality Check:**

- [ ] No tautological tests that only repeat implementation logic
- [ ] No over-mocking of core logic
- [ ] Error paths covered where relevant

**Implementation Quality Check:**

- [ ] No unresolved placeholder comments (`TODO`, `FIXME`, `HACK`) unless tracked in `TECH_DEBT.md`
- [ ] Error handling uses specific error types, not generic catch-all suppression
- [ ] External state dependencies are explicit
- [ ] Implementation follows `ARCHITECTURE.md` layering rules

**Security Check:**

- [ ] User input validated at the boundary
- [ ] Operations verify caller permissions where applicable
- [ ] No sensitive information leaks to unauthorized contexts

**Doc Sync Check (show evidence, not just checkboxes):**

- [ ] If this completed an Exec Plan, `STATE.md` was updated in place, the plan moved to `completed/`, and `exec-plans/index.md` was updated
- [ ] If architecture/layering changed, `ARCHITECTURE.md` was updated
- [ ] If product behavior changed, `knowledge-base.md` and `STATE.md` were updated
- [ ] If deployment/infrastructure changed, `DEPLOYMENT.md`, `STATE.md`, and `ARCHITECTURE.md` were checked
- [ ] Decisions meeting `DECISIONS.md` admission criteria were recorded
- [ ] New tech debt and backlog items were triaged into `TECH_DEBT.md` vs `BACKLOG.md`
- [ ] Cross-references between updated docs were verified
- [ ] Evidence: list each updated doc and a one-line summary

### Task Completion Criteria

A development task is complete only when all conditions are met:

1. ✅ CI checks pass
2. ✅ Self-review checklist shown to the user
3. ✅ Affected docs updated
4. ✅ New/modified code is traceable to a spec source (Design Doc, Exec Plan, or approved no-doc task plan)
5. ✅ Remaining gaps are either fixed or explicitly tracked in `TECH_DEBT.md` / `BACKLOG.md`

## Git Workflow

- **Never commit directly to the main branch** — verify current branch with `git branch` before committing
- Merge via feature branch + PR. Naming: `feat/xxx`, `fix/xxx`, `refactor/xxx`, `test/xxx`
- **Never run `git checkout -- .`, `git checkout <branch> -- .`, or `git restore .` with uncommitted changes in the working tree**
- **Prefix any git command that opens an editor with `GIT_EDITOR=true`**:
  - `git rebase --continue` / `git rebase -i` → `GIT_EDITOR=true git rebase --continue`
  - `git commit --amend` without `-m` → add `-m "..."` or `--no-edit`
  - `git merge` with a merge commit and no `-m` → add `--no-edit` or `-m "..."`
  - `git tag -a` / `git revert` without `-m` → add `-m "..."`
