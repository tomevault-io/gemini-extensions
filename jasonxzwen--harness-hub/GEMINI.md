# Harness Hub Instructions

Harness Hub initializes and governs repo-local agent harnesses across multiple projects. Most inner skills may come from upstream sources and should keep their upstream style by default; this repo mainly owns routing, source records, harness templates, lifecycle tooling, and a small number of custom workflow skills.

Keep every distributed skill in the standard layout under `skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` with optional `references/`, `scripts/`, and `assets/` spokes.

## Core Rules

1. Think before coding.
   - State assumptions when the request is ambiguous.
   - Surface tradeoffs instead of silently choosing a risky interpretation.
   - Ask only when a reasonable implementation assumption would be unsafe.

2. Simplicity first.
   - Add the minimum code or documentation needed for the requested behavior.
   - Avoid speculative abstractions, options, and host-specific branches.

3. Surgical changes.
   - Touch only files tied to the request.
   - Preserve unrelated worktree changes.
   - Match the existing style of the file you edit.

4. Goal-driven execution.
   - Define success criteria before broad changes.
   - Verify with the nearest tests and validation gates before handoff.

5. PR closeout is part of delivery.
   - After creating or updating a pull request, check the remote PR state before declaring the task complete.
   - Verify mergeability and review the CI/check-run status after the pushed head settles.
   - If the PR is not clean because of conflicts, failed CI, or another actionable issue, diagnose and resolve it, rerun relevant validation, and push the fix.
   - Stop and ask the user only when the blocker requires a user decision, credential, permission, reviewer action, protected-branch override, or external service recovery.
   - Do not merge the PR unless the user explicitly asks for that remote mutation.

## Personal Distribution Policy

- Do not rewrite imported skill bodies solely for house style, description format, progressive-loading style, or platform-neutral wording.
- Prefer preserving upstream `SKILL.md` content and placing local behavior in `AGENTS.md`, `docs/skill-routing.md`, `skills/workflow-router/`, owner workflow skills, and `capabilities/index.json`.
- Edit imported skill content only when the upstream text is unsafe, unusable in this repo, legally unclear, or directly conflicts with the routing overlay.
- Do not add host-specific tool names, config paths, UI metadata, or runner assumptions to distributed skill bodies.
- Do not add `agents/openai.yaml`, `.claude/skills/`, `.opencode/skills/`, or similar host-local metadata to the source skill tree.
- Keep project-local Codex bootstrap wrappers under ignored `.codex/skills/<skill-name>/`; each wrapper points back to the canonical `skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`.
- Put host packaging outside skills. Claude plugin support belongs in `.claude-plugin/`; the skill content remains standard.
- If an upstream skill assumes a specific runner, prefer routing notes, source records, or explicit-only status before rewriting its body.
- If a capability cannot be used safely without rewriting away its core value, keep it as an evaluated source or explicit-only reference.
- Keep repo harness templates under `harness/<template-name>/`; root harness files in target projects are installed only through explicit harness lifecycle commands, never through default skill installation.

## Codex Worktree Startup Gate

Before using repo-local skill activation or running `workflow-router` in a fresh Codex worktree, check whether `.codex/skills/` and `.harness-hub/state/` exist. Git worktree creation does not copy ignored generated directories.

For write tasks, run the tracked read-only preflight first:

```powershell
bun run codex:worktree-check -- --write-task
```

If the preflight fails, run the portable local setup before continuing:

```powershell
bun run codex:worktree-setup
```

For purely read-only questions, `bun run codex:worktree-check` may warn and still exit zero; continue only while clearly stating that repo-local skills are not yet bootstrapped.

This setup is local initialization only: it syncs `.codex/skills/`, creates missing `.harness-hub/state/` templates, preserves existing task state by default, and must not create a checkpoint commit. Use `bun run codex:worktree-setup -- --reset-state` only when intentionally starting over with clean local task state.

To avoid repeating this manual setup in this clone, install the advisory local Git hook once:

```powershell
bun run codex:worktree-hook:install
```

The hook uses Git's `post-checkout` hook, which also runs after `git worktree add` unless `--no-checkout` is used. It calls the same setup script, exits zero on setup failure, and does not perform remote writes.

## Skill Routing

Use `docs/skill-routing.md` to resolve overlapping skills. Prefer the narrowest matching skill:

- Non-trivial requests: use `workflow-router` first to classify the request into exactly one owner state; when a terminal is available, run or mirror `node skills/workflow-router/scripts/workflow-check.mjs --prompt "<request>" --json` before substantive work.
- Questions and evidence lookup: use `answer-workflow`.
- English prose AI-tell cleanup or draft review: use `stop-slop` only for English prose; do not use it for Chinese output, code explanations, specs, or status reports.
- SDD change work: use `sdd-workflow`; align core details, target spec, and acceptance criteria before implementation.
- Runtime bug reports that start from failure evidence: use `diagnosis-workflow`.
- Code, plan, release, UI, or security review: use `review-workflow`.
- Delivery, validation closeout, cleanup, or handoff: use `delivery-workflow`.
- Harness Hub source, routing, capability, npm lifecycle, harness templates, or cleanup work: use `hub-maintenance-workflow`.
- Plan/design pressure testing: use `grill-me`.
- Runtime bugs/performance regressions: use `diagnose`.
- Agent/tool harness failures: use `agent-introspection-debugging`.
- Production feature work or confirmed bug fixes with tests: use `tdd-workflow`.
- Native goal/story loops are now handled by Codex/Claude Code directly; Harness Hub no longer distributes Ralph PRD or loop skills.
- Throwaway design exploration: use `prototype`; use `frontend-design` for production UI.
- Deep pre-PR review: use `compound-code-review`; use `security-review` only for focused security checks.
- Final command gates and build/test validation: use `verification-loop`.

## Workflow Router Direction

The target architecture is a thin, executable `workflow-router` that classifies each non-trivial request into exactly one workflow state: question, SDD change, diagnosis, review, delivery, or Harness Hub maintenance. Default development should be SDD-first with TDD embedded. Do not start implementation before the user's core details, target spec, and acceptance criteria are aligned.

`effective-interact` is high-priority communication infrastructure. Default-consider it for every non-trivial session, especially after material repo or skill changes. Its job is to reduce human interpretation cost through answer-first structure, visual comparison, evidence, validation, and handoff artifacts; it does not replace production UI, slide, or bundled app skills.

Subagents are an optimization owned by the active workflow, not a default behavior of every skill. Use them only for independent read-only research, review, docs work, verification, or clearly disjoint write scopes; the main agent keeps final decisions, integration, and user-facing conclusions.

Hooks should start as advisory or deterministic local checks only. Do not introduce blocking hooks, remote actions, credential changes, posting, pushing, publishing, or agent dispatch without explicit user approval and security review.

## Agent Development Workflow

README files are human-facing visual navigation. Keep agent execution rules here, in owner workflow skills, or in focused docs. Do not turn README into an agent checklist.

For feature, bug-fix, refactor, product/spec change, or implementation work:

1. Route first with `workflow-router`; use the selected owner and do not let helper skills compete for top-level ownership.
2. Inspect repo docs, code paths, existing state, tests, source records, and relevant upstream references before proposing a direction.
3. Treat lightweight brainstorming as part of SDD: compare 2-3 evidence-backed directions, recommend one, and record rejected alternatives.
4. Write the active task contract before implementation when `.harness-hub/state/` exists:
   - `current-task.md`: goal, assumptions, non-goals, allowed paths, forbidden paths, requirement intake, discovery/brainstorming, target spec, acceptance criteria, P0/P1/P2 test matrix, validation commands, open questions, alignment status, and checkpoint policy.
   - `decisions.md`: accepted direction, rationale, alternatives, and decision-level changes.
   - `progress.md`: current phase, completed work, validation records, runtime signals, blockers, PR status, and checkpoint commit state.
   - `session-handoff.md`: restart status, changed files, validation evidence, residual risk, blockers, and next action.
5. Ask only blocking open questions before implementation. A blocking question changes user-visible behavior, safety, data ownership, compatibility, cost, release or rollback behavior, external side effects, allowed paths, or acceptance criteria.
6. Implement one public behavior at a time through `tdd-workflow`: RED, GREEN, REFACTOR. If direct tests are impractical, define the deterministic substitute before production edits.
7. Verify with P0/P1/P2 validation: P0 must pass before handoff, P1 is run or risk-assessed, and P2 hardening is run or explicitly deferred.
8. Use `effective-interact` for material plans, evidence maps, reviews, and handoffs only when structure lowers human reading cost.
9. Before handoff, update progress, decisions when needed, session handoff, and validation evidence. Do not claim completion from intent or partial progress.

## Skill Quality Governance

Use `docs/skill-quality-guide.md` as the quality bar for authoring, importing, reviewing, and maintaining skills.

- Treat `SKILL.md` `description` as routing logic.
- Prefer "Load when..." phrasing for local routing and workflow-owner skills; do not rewrite imported descriptions solely to satisfy style.
- Keep heavy or conditional content out of `SKILL.md`; use `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/`.
- Do not change a local routing-sensitive description without updating routing/eval coverage unless the edit is purely mechanical.
- Before adding an installable skill, verify it fills a bounded gap and does not duplicate global instructions.
- Keep quality inventory findings report-only unless they map to a real routing, safety, source, or distribution problem.

## CLI Lifecycle

Use these verbs for target-repo lifecycle work:

- `harness-hub check <target> --json`
- `harness-hub analyze <target> --json`
- `harness-hub analyze <target> --agent-readiness --harness --json`
- `harness-hub init-harness <target> --dry-run --json`
- `harness-hub init-harness <target> --yes`
- `harness-hub validate-harness <target> --json`
- `harness-hub install <target> --target standard --dry-run`
- `harness-hub install <target> --target standard --yes`
- `harness-hub status <target> --json`
- `harness-hub update <target> --dry-run --json`
- `harness-hub migrate-lock <target> --dry-run --json`
- `harness-hub remove <target> --dry-run --json`

`install` remains the standard skill install command and must not create root harness files. `init-harness` owns root harness initialization and must stay dry-run/confirmation guarded.
`check` is read-only startup guidance: it reports CLI and target managed-component freshness separately and must not auto-update either layer.

Harness initialization is a hard gate for target repositories:
- Use `init-harness`, not `install`, when root harness files are needed.
- Do not start implementation in a target repo until `AGENTS.md`, `feature_list.json`, `clean-state-checklist.md`, `definition-of-done.md`, `evaluator-rubric.md`, `quality-document.md`, `scripts/harness-validate.mjs`, and `.harness-hub/state/{current-task.md,decisions.md,progress.md,session-handoff.md}` exist.
- Run `harness-hub check <target> --json` during startup and treat update availability, missing locks, and registry unavailability as non-blocking advisory output unless the task explicitly asks to update.
- Fill `.harness-hub/state/current-task.md` with goal, non-goals, allowed paths, forbidden paths, acceptance criteria, validation commands, and checkpoint policy before coding.
- Run `node scripts/harness-validate.mjs` or `harness-hub validate-harness <target> --json`; fix harness failures before product edits.
- Record validation command status, passed/failed counts when available, evidence, and checkpoint commit state in progress and handoff state.
- Use verified checkpoint commits for completed atomic units when the task permits commits; otherwise record the skip reason.

Before release-oriented CLI changes, run `bun run validate`, `git diff --check`, and the relevant smoke flow.

## Codex Worktree Setup

For local Codex dogfooding, the generated `.codex/skills/` tree and `.harness-hub/state/` task memory are host-local and ignored. Edit source skills under `skills/`, then run worktree setup to regenerate wrappers and create any missing local harness state templates.

At the start of a fresh Codex worktree, before relying on repo-local skill activation or workflow routing, run worktree setup if `.codex/skills/` or `.harness-hub/state/` is missing. Git worktree creation does not copy ignored generated directories.

Use this portable worktree setup command from the worktree root:

```powershell
node scripts/setup-codex-worktree.mjs
```

The equivalent package script is:

```powershell
bun run codex:worktree-setup
```

Do not hard-code a machine path in setup commands. The script derives the repository root from its own location so fresh worktrees can generate ignored `.codex/skills/` copies, create missing `.harness-hub/state/` templates, preserve existing task state on reruns, and skip checkpoint commits for setup-only work. Use `--reset-state` or `--fresh` only when intentionally discarding local task state.

For repeated local Codex worktree creation, run this once per clone:

```powershell
bun run codex:worktree-hook:install
```

This installs a managed advisory `post-checkout` hook in the Git hooks path. The hook runs `node scripts/setup-codex-worktree.mjs` for new worktree checkouts, preserves existing task state, and leaves `bun run codex:worktree-setup` as the deterministic fallback.

## Third-Party Skill Evaluation

Use `hub-maintenance-workflow` whenever the user asks to evaluate, install, compare, or import a third-party skill repository.

For every third-party skill evaluation:

- Read upstream README, skill bodies, plugin metadata, and license before deciding.
- Compare against `skills/`, root `AGENTS.md`, and `docs/skill-routing.md`.
- Install only when the candidate fills a real gap or provides a materially better bounded workflow.
- Preserve upstream skill content by default; add local routing/source records instead of rewriting body text for consistency.
- Prefer reject or explicit-only status when the candidate repeats existing behavior or would create trigger noise.
- Update `docs/source-projects.md`, `docs/skill-routing.md`, `README.md`, and inventory docs when installation, counts, sources, vendor paths, or runtime state change.
- Run `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\validate-skills.ps1 -SkipExternal` before finishing skill maintenance.
