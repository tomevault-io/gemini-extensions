# Wayflow

Wayflow is an embeddable workflow/graph editor library. Plain TypeScript and the DOM — no UI framework. Everything composes as `createX(params)` returning an `HTMLElement` or a handle object.

## Project structure

A monorepo of layered packages. Each depends only on the ones listed above it, and lower layers never reference upper-layer concepts in names or comments:

- `core` — generic graph primitives (Graph/Node/Edge, viewport, history). No dependencies; no `workflow`/`LLM`/`agent`/`tool` vocabulary.
- `dom` — the DOM canvas/editor (→ core). Stays generic; no `WorkflowEditor` or workflow concepts.
- `agent` — workflow node types, the runtime handler API, validation, `WayflowError` (→ core).
- `runtime` — the execution engine (→ agent, core).
- `models` — provider-neutral LLM/image adapters (→ agent, core, runtime).
- `ui` — the `WorkflowEditor` and design-system primitives (→ core, dom, agent).

## Commands

The repo uses pnpm. Build is [tsdown](https://tsdown.dev) (Rolldown-powered), config in `tsdown.config.ts`.

- `pnpm build` — build all packages to `dist/` (also typechecks via `--dts`). Fast enough that there are no per-package build scripts.
- `npx tsc -b packages/<pkg>` — fast typecheck of a single package.
- `pnpm check` — Biome format + lint check; `pnpm check:write` to autofix; `pnpm format` to format only.
- `pnpm test` — Vitest (`tests/**/*.test.ts`); `pnpm test:watch` for watch mode.
- `pnpm typecheck:tests` — typecheck the `tests/` tree (`tsconfig.test.json`).

A green build is the type check; Biome enforces format/lint. The pure packages — `core`, `agent`, `runtime` — have unit suites under `tests/`; the DOM-bound `dom`/`ui` have none yet, so verify those by running an example app under `examples/` (`quickstart`, `custom-nodes`, `low-level`, `with-backend`). CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs format check + lint + build + typecheck-tests + test on every PR.

## Formatting

Biome (`biome.json`): no semicolons, single quotes, 2-space indentation, 80-col width. Run `pnpm format`. When something isn't specified here, follow the conventions already used in the surrounding code.

Relative imports are extensionless (`from './protocol'`, never `'./protocol.js'`) — the build resolves them, and the whole codebase is consistent on this.

## Code style

- Group code into sections with banner comments, with tunable constants at the top of the file. The `–` rule lines run to the 80-col line width: `// ` + 77 en-dashes (`–`, U+2013); for an indented banner, pad so the line still ends at column 80, so a long title never overruns the rule. CSS banners are `/* ` + 74 en-dashes + ` */`.
  ```ts
  // –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
  //  Section title
  // –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
  ```
- Comment only when the code and names don't already explain it. Never restate the code, narrate a change, or reference a plan; comments must read standalone. Default to none.
- Use common, widely-understood names — never cute ones (`full`/`compact`, not `roomy`/`narrow`).
- Any string-literal value used in more than one place becomes an UPPER_SNAKE `as const` object with a derived type (e.g. `PORT_SIDE`, `TONE`). Never repeat raw enum strings.
- Build views as `createX(params)` factories returning an element or a handle (`{ element, ... }`) — no classes. In large factories, extract each DOM piece into a named `create<Thing>` helper with a typed `Props`; small leaf factories may build inline.
- Prefer `interface`. Avoid casts, and never use `as any`.
- Keep a helper local until a second use, then extract — don't duplicate, and don't abstract on the first use. Prefer reusing or extending an existing primitive over adding a new one.
- Encapsulate DOM-state changes in stateless helpers in the owning module (e.g. `setControlInvalid`); don't leak CSS class names to callers.
- Colors and spacing come from CSS variables that define both light and dark values — never hardcode a theme color.

## Performance

Never tear down and rebuild a DOM subtree on a high-frequency event (stream chunks, run data, `pointermove`, scroll, resize). Build once and update in place: gate renders on whether the displayed data actually changed, and emit what changed so listeners can skip irrelevant updates. For data-driven views, use `UpdatableView<T>` and `createListReconciler` from `packages/ui/src/view.ts`.

## Testing

- Tests live in a separate `tests/<package>/` tree that mirrors the package's `src` layout (no `packages/` prefix); never colocate them with source. The Vitest glob is `tests/**/*.test.ts` only.
- Test through the public surface a consumer actually imports — the published umbrella subpaths (`wayflow/runtime`, `wayflow/core`, …), not the internal workspace names (`@wayflow/*`, which source uses to depend across packages). This catches export-map regressions a `@wayflow/*` import would miss. Black-box: internal helpers (e.g. the scheduler's `applyArrayOp`) are exercised via `run()`, not imported, so they stay free to refactor.
- Shared builders and assertions live in `tests/helpers.ts`, kept thin (`node`/`edge`/`graph`/`collect`, plus `expectCompleted`/`expectPaused` to narrow a `RunOutcome`). A helper file must not contain `.test.` in its name or the glob will run it.
- Don't add injectable clocks/UUIDs for testability: in the runtime they're recorded into events, never branched on, and continuity (same `runId` across resume) is asserted by reading the value out, not controlling it. Revisit only when a time-as-logic feature (node timeout, retry/backoff) lands.

## Conventions to know

- `editor.getGraph()` returns a `structuredClone` — captured node references are snapshots and won't see later mutations. Compute from live data.
- Model features must be provider-neutral: providers implement a contract and declare capability flags; generic behavior lives in the handler, never scoped to one provider.
- Name a node type's runtime handler and editor model-option after the node type (`imageGeneration` node → `createImageGenerationHandler`, `imageGeneration: { models }`); name providers after the vendor API, not the node (`createOpenAIProvider`, `createOpenAIImageProvider` — note neither says `llm`). Keep data-layer names distinct from node names: `image` is the data type and `createImageInput`; `imageGeneration` is the node that produces it.
- An error's `message` is technical (for developers); its `hint` is an editor-actionable suggestion. Both serve end users and developers — omit `hint` when no advice fits both.
- Diagnostics logging: the `Logger` primitive + `createConsoleLogger` live in `agent` (next to `WayflowError`). Integration surfaces expose a `debug?: boolean` one-liner and a `logger?: Logger` escape hatch (`createRuntime`, `createWorkflowEditor`); resolve as `logger ?? (debug ? createConsoleLogger() : undefined)`. Lower layers that can't see `agent` (e.g. `dom`) stay logger-free — they *report* errors through callbacks/events and let the integration layer log them.
- No third-party content (code, prose, fonts, assets). The one exception is Lucide icon path geometry in `packages/ui/src/icons.ts`, kept with an inline attribution.

## Boundaries

- Ask before: large refactors, new dependencies, new packages, or changes to a package's public API.
- Never: use `as any`; rebuild the DOM on high-frequency events; write comments that narrate a change; repeat raw enum strings; reference an upper-layer concept from a lower-layer package; add third-party content.

## Keeping this file useful

Add a rule only when it is non-obvious, recurring, and specific enough to act on. Keep it high-signal, and remove rules that go stale.
