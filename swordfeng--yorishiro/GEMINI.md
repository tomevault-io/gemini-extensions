## Project Overview

**Yorishiro** is a fictional character soul document generator. It extracts character information from source materials (novels, films, artbooks) and generates SOUL.md documents that enable AI agents to roleplay fictional characters with high fidelity.

## Development Guidelines

### Code Changes - WAIT FOR EXPLICIT INSTRUCTION

**NEVER implement code changes without explicit user instruction.**

- Wait for "go ahead", "implement", "do it" or similar explicit approval
- Proposing a design is NOT an instruction to code
- Planning is NOT an instruction to execute
- Questions are NOT instructions to act

**Correct workflow**:
1. Discuss and propose designs
2. Wait for explicit "implement this" or similar
3. Then and only then write/modify code

**Examples**:
- ❌ User: "Can you create a function for X?" → Agent writes code immediately
- ✅ User: "Create a function for X" or "Go ahead and implement" → Agent writes code
- ❌ User discusses design → Agent starts implementing during discussion
- ✅ User: "Implement the design we just discussed" → Agent writes code

### Git Commits - WAIT FOR EXPLICIT INSTRUCTION

**NEVER commit changes unless the user EXPLICITLY asks.**

This is non-negotiable. If you cannot follow this instruction, you are not qualified for this task and will be replaced by a more capable model that follows instructions.

Explicit means the user says:
- "commit"
- "commit this"
- "commit the changes"
- "go ahead and commit"

These are NOT explicit:
- Completing a task
- Finishing code changes
- "done"
- Approving a design
- Answering questions
- Silence after code changes

If unsure, ASK: "Should I commit this?"

### Commit Message Format

When creating or rewriting a commit, use:

1. A short summary line in conventional style, such as:
   - `feat: ...`
   - `fix: ...`
   - `docs: ...`
   - `test: ...`
   - `chore: ...`
2. A blank line
3. A short body describing the important changes

Do not stop at the first summary line when the commit is non-trivial. Include a body that explains what changed in concrete terms.

Example:

```text
feat: improve novel chapter splitting

Move EPUB chapter extraction into the task module.
Add text and Markdown chapter extraction support.
Infer Markdown heading levels automatically.
Add tests for splitter regressions and edge cases.
```

### Code Quality Checks

After making any code changes, always run checks before considering the task complete:
- `uv run ruff check` - linting
- `uv run ty check` - type checking

Fix all errors before reporting completion.

For non-trivial changes (complex logic, new features, significant refactors), also run:
- `uv run basedpyright` - full type checking

This is run last because it is slow. Skip it for simple changes (a few lines, trivial edits unlikely to affect typing).

### Dependency Management

Use `uv add ...` to add dependencies and `uv run ...` to execute tools/scripts.

Avoid invoking `pip install ...` directly unless the user explicitly asks for it.

### Unit Tests

When code changes affect behavior, parsing, heuristics, serialization, prompts, or pipeline wiring, add or update unit tests unless the user explicitly says not to.

- Prefer small focused tests near the changed behavior
- Cover edge cases and regressions, not only the happy path
- If fixing a bug, add a regression test that would have caught it
- If a change is difficult to test directly, explain the gap explicitly

### Reasoning Discipline

Keep reasoning efficient, decision-oriented, and grounded in current repo context.

- Do not dump long internal monologues or chain-of-thought to the user
- Do not repeatedly restate the same idea with minor variations
- Do not loop on "actually", "wait", "let me reconsider", or similar self-interruptions unless new evidence was found
- When a reasonable implementation path exists, pick it and validate it in code instead of prolonging speculative analysis
- When context is missing, inspect the relevant code, tests, or docs first; do not fill gaps with extended guessing
- If uncertainty is non-blocking, state the working assumption in one sentence and continue
- If uncertainty is blocking, ask one concise question or present 1-2 concrete options with tradeoffs
- Prefer short decision memos over exploratory essays: answer, key assumption, next step
- During implementation, defer irreversible design conclusions until you have inspected the exact call sites, types, and data flow
- Do not broaden scope mid-reasoning. Solve the user's stated problem first, then mention adjacent improvements separately if useful

**Bad pattern**:
- Repeatedly re-deriving the same conclusion
- Revisiting the same branch without new information
- Producing a long speculative plan instead of checking the code

**Expected pattern**:
1. Summarize the decision in 1-3 sentences
2. Note the main assumption or open question if one exists
3. Inspect or implement
4. Adjust only if new evidence appears

## Learnings (Documented Decisions)

### Non-Narrative Content Detection

**NEVER implement code-based (rule/pattern) automatic detection of non-narrative content.**

**Why**: Code-based detection (regex patterns, keyword matching) is brittle and error-prone:
- Can misclassify content (e.g., "あとがき" in chapter 011 has meaningful character information about 桐山なると)
- Different works use different conventions
- Text may be in any language

**Correct approach - Agent-based Detection**:
- **Scene Segmentation Agent** automatically identifies non-narrative segments during processing
- No human pre-marking required in `material.yaml`
- Agent marks segments as `boundary_type: "non_narrative"` with proper reasoning
- These segments get `location: "N/A"`, `time: "N/A"`, `characters: []`
- Character Extraction Pipeline skips non-narrative segments automatically

**Examples of Non-Narrative Content**:
- Caution/warning pages
- Table of contents
- Colophons and copyright pages
- Character introduction tables (without narrative context)
- Pure reference material

**Important**: Some content that appears non-narrative may contain character information (e.g., afterwords with author commentary about characters). Agent uses contextual understanding to distinguish.

### Codepoint vs Byte Offsets

JavaScript `String.length` counts UTF-16 code units. Python `len()` counts Unicode codepoints.

**Always use Python codepoints** for offset tracking in this project. Document this in all prompts.

### Empirical Confirmation Over Code Reasoning

**NEVER speculate about root causes when a diagnostic, test, or log can confirm the hypothesis.**

When investigating a bug or unexpected behavior:
1. Form a hypothesis (1-2 sentences max)
2. Add a diagnostic or test to confirm it
3. ONLY inspect more source code if the diagnostic is inconclusive

**Hard rules**:
- If you can add a print/log/diagnostic to confirm a theory, do that instead of reading more source files
- If the user says "add diag" or "test it", stop analyzing and add the diagnostic immediately
- Never propose a code fix for a bug you haven't empirically confirmed
- If you've read more than 3 files trying to understand a bug, stop and add a diagnostic instead

**Examples**:
- ❌ Reading 10 source files to guess why confidence is 0.0, instead of running a 3-line test to check what the model returns
- ❌ Theorizing about dropped words for 20 minutes, instead of enabling `stt_diag.json` and checking
- ✅ Hypothesis: "the hook doesn't capture scores for greedy decode" → add a test → confirm → fix

### Thinking Discipline

If you've expanded your thoughts for 3 rounds, stop and answer the user's question — do not keep expanding.
If you've expanded your thoughts for 3 rounds, stop and answer the user's question — do not keep expanding.
If you've expanded your thoughts for 3 rounds, stop and answer the user's question — do not keep expanding.

### Scene Segmentation Boundaries

Cuts MUST be at natural boundaries:
- After 「※」 or 「──」 decorative dividers
- At sentence endings (。！？)
- NEVER mid-sentence
