# elephc — Developer Guide

## What is this

A PHP-to-native compiler written in Rust. Compiles a static subset of PHP to ARM64 assembly, producing standalone macOS Mach-O binaries. No interpreter, no VM, no runtime dependencies.

## Build & run

```bash
cargo build              # dev build
cargo build --release    # optimized build
cargo run -- file.php    # compile a PHP file
```

The compiler outputs a native binary next to the source file (e.g., `file.php` → `file`).

## Test policy

**Every feature must have tests before it's considered done.** The test suite is the primary quality gate.

### Running tests

```bash
cargo test                          # run all tests (slow — ~5-6 min due to as+ld per codegen test)
cargo test -- --include-ignored     # run ALL tests including those requiring external libs
cargo test --test codegen_tests     # run only end-to-end tests
cargo test test_fizzbuzz            # run a specific test
```

Some tests are marked `#[ignore]` because they require external libraries (e.g., SDL2) not available in CI. **Before committing, always run `cargo test -- --include-ignored` locally** to verify nothing is broken — including ignored tests.

### Test strategy during development

The full test suite is slow because each codegen test spawns `as` + `ld` + runs the binary. To avoid waiting several minutes on every change:

1. **While developing a feature**: run only the tests for that feature (`cargo test test_my_feature`)
2. **When the feature is complete**: run the full suite once (`cargo test`) to check for regressions
3. **PHP cross-check**: opt-in via `ELEPHC_PHP_CHECK=1 cargo test` — verifies output matches PHP interpreter

### Test structure

| File | What it tests | How |
|---|---|---|
| `tests/lexer_tests.rs` | Tokenization | Asserts token sequences from source strings |
| `tests/parser_tests.rs` | AST construction | Asserts AST node structure and operator precedence |
| `tests/codegen_tests.rs` | Full pipeline (end-to-end) | Compiles PHP → binary, runs it, asserts stdout |
| `tests/error_tests.rs` | Error reporting | Asserts that invalid programs produce the right error messages |

### Test coverage requirements

- **New language construct** (keyword, operator, statement): needs lexer, parser, codegen, AND error tests
- **New operator**: needs a Pratt parser binding power test verifying precedence relative to adjacent operators
- **New statement type**: needs at least one codegen test showing correct output, one test for edge cases (empty body, nested), and one error test for malformed syntax
- **New built-in function**: needs codegen tests for normal use and error test for wrong argument count/types
- **Bug fix**: must include a regression test that would have caught the bug
- **Every feature also needs an example** in `examples/`. If an existing example can showcase the new feature naturally, update it. Otherwise, create a new `examples/<name>/main.php` with its own `.gitignore` (containing `*.s`, `*.o`, `main`). Examples should be small, readable programs that demonstrate real use cases — not just test cases.

### Writing codegen tests

Codegen tests compile inline PHP source and assert stdout:

```rust
#[test]
fn test_my_feature() {
    let out = compile_and_run("<?php echo 1 + 2;");
    assert_eq!(out, "3");
}
```

Each test runs in an isolated temp directory. Tests run in parallel — the `compile_and_run` helper handles isolation automatically.

## Architecture

```
PHP source → Lexer (tokens) → Parser (AST) → Resolver (include/require) → NameResolver (namespace/use/FQN canonicalization) → Type Checker → Codegen (ARM64 asm) → as + ld → binary
```

### Key modules

| Module | Entry point | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| `src/lexer/` | `tokenize()` | Source → `Vec<(Token, Span)>` |
| `src/parser/` | `parse()` | Tokens → `Program` (Vec of Stmt). Pratt parser for expressions |
| `src/resolver.rs` | `resolve()` | Resolves `include`/`require` by inlining referenced files. Runs before namespace/name canonicalization |
| `src/name_resolver.rs` | `resolve()` | Applies namespace/use rules, rewrites references to canonical fully-qualified names, and flattens namespace-only AST nodes before type checking |
| `src/types/` | `check()` | Type checking, returns `CheckResult` with `TypeEnv`, function/class/interface/FFI metadata, and the internal `Mixed` type for heterogeneous assoc-array values |
| `src/codegen/` | `generate()` | AST → ARM64 assembly string. Top-level orchestration lives in `mod.rs`, while most lowering lives under `expr/`, `stmt/`, and `runtime/` |
| `src/errors/` | `report()` | Error formatting with line:col |
| `src/span.rs` | `Span` | Source position (line, col) attached to all AST nodes |

### Codegen layout

- `src/codegen/expr.rs` is mainly a dispatcher; most expression lowering now lives in focused helpers under `src/codegen/expr/`
- `src/codegen/stmt.rs` is mainly a dispatcher; most statement lowering now lives in focused helpers under `src/codegen/stmt/`
- `src/codegen/runtime/mod.rs` emits runtime code (`__rt_*` routines)
- `src/codegen/runtime/data.rs` emits runtime `.data` / `.bss` symbols and metadata tables
- `src/codegen/context.rs` carries variable layout, ownership state, class metadata, and FFI metadata through codegen

### Adding a new operator

1. Add token to `src/lexer/token.rs`
2. Add scanning logic to `src/lexer/scan.rs`
3. Add `BinOp` variant to `src/parser/ast.rs`
4. Add one line to `infix_bp()` in `src/parser/expr.rs` (the Pratt parser binding power table)
5. Add type checking in `src/types/checker/mod.rs`
6. Add ARM64 codegen in the relevant file under `src/codegen/expr/` (and only touch `src/codegen/expr.rs` if the dispatcher must learn about a new helper path)
7. Add tests in all 4 test files

### Adding a new statement type

1. Add `StmtKind` variant to `src/parser/ast.rs`
2. Add parser logic in `src/parser/stmt.rs`
3. Add type checking in `src/types/checker/mod.rs`
4. Add codegen in the relevant file under `src/codegen/stmt/` (and only touch `src/codegen/stmt.rs` if the dispatcher must learn about a new helper path)
5. If it introduces variables, update `collect_local_vars` in `src/codegen/functions.rs`
6. Add tests

### Adding a new built-in function

1. Add type signature in `src/types/checker/builtins.rs` (argument count, types, return type)
2. Create a new file in `src/codegen/builtins/<category>/` (e.g., `strings/my_func.rs`)
3. Add `mod my_func;` plus any needed re-export/dispatcher wiring in the category's `mod.rs`
4. If the function needs an ARM64 runtime routine, create `src/codegen/runtime/strings/my_func.rs`
5. Add module/re-export wiring in the relevant `runtime/<category>/mod.rs`, then call it from `runtime/mod.rs`
6. Add codegen and error tests

Leaf builtin/runtime files contain exactly **one emitter function**. Keep dispatcher/re-export files (`mod.rs`) as orchestration-only files, and keep runtime data emission in `src/codegen/runtime/data.rs`.

### File size policy

As a general rule, aim to keep source files under **500 lines of code**. This is a maintainability guideline, not a blind numeric rule.

The real goal is to avoid files that become hard to reason about because they mix multiple responsibilities. In practice:

- **Dispatcher/orchestration files** (`mod.rs`, top-level drivers, large checker/codegen coordinators) should stay slim. If they grow large, split them aggressively.
- **Multi-responsibility files** should be split once they start accumulating unrelated concerns, even if the line count is not yet extreme.
- **Leaf files that implement one cohesive feature** are allowed to exceed 500 lines when splitting them would create artificial fragmentation.

Examples of files that may reasonably stay above the soft limit:

- a single runtime emitter implementing one substantial builtin or runtime routine
- a single compiler pass file that is still clearly about one feature and one code path
- a self-contained parser/lowering/runtime leaf where splitting would only spread one mental model across several tiny files

Examples of files that should usually be split:

- a file that mixes dispatch, validation, data collection, and post-processing
- a file that contains several unrelated builtins or runtime helpers
- a file that acts as a “miscellaneous bucket” for code that did not get a home

So the policy is:

- treat **500 LOC as a warning sign**
- treat **mixed responsibilities** as the real trigger for refactoring
- do **not** split a file that owns one coherent feature just to satisfy the number

In short: prefer **cohesion over mechanical line-count compliance**. A 650-line mono-feature leaf is acceptable; a 350-line multi-purpose orchestrator is already a refactor candidate.

### Codegen conventions (ARM64)

- **Integers**: result in `x0`
- **Floats**: result in `d0`
- **Strings**: pointer in `x1`, length in `x2`
- **Function args**: `x0`-`x7` (int = 1 reg, string = 2 regs), `d0`-`d7` (floats)
- **Return value**: same as expression result (`x0`, `d0`, or `x1`/`x2`)
- **Stack frame**: `x29` = frame pointer, `x30` = link register, locals at negative offsets from `x29`
- **ABI helpers**: `src/codegen/abi.rs` centralizes load/store/write per type
- **Labels**: use `ctx.next_label("prefix")` — global counter prevents collisions across functions
- **Mixed values**: `PhpType::Mixed` is an internal boxed runtime shape used for heterogeneous associative-array values; codegen/runtime must preserve the boxed cell contract instead of treating it like a plain scalar

### Assembly comment policy

**Every `emitter.instruction(...)` call MUST have an inline `//` comment** explaining what the ARM64 instruction does. This is mandatory — the codebase is educational and every assembly line must be understandable by someone learning how compilers work.

Rules:

1. **Every instruction line gets a comment.** No exceptions. If you add a new `emitter.instruction(...)`, it must have a `// comment`.
2. **Alignment: `//` starts at column 81.** Pad with spaces so the `//` is at the 81st character position (1-indexed). If the code itself is >= 80 characters, add exactly one space before `//`.
3. **Block comments before related groups.** Use `// -- description --` on a standalone line before a block of related instructions (e.g., `// -- set up stack frame --`, `// -- copy bytes from source --`).
4. **Comments explain intent, not mnemonics.** Write "store argc from OS" not "store x0 to memory". The reader can see the instruction — explain *why* it's there.

Example of correct formatting:

```rust
    // -- set up stack frame --
    emitter.instruction("sub sp, sp, #32");                                 // allocate 32 bytes on the stack
    emitter.instruction("stp x29, x30, [sp, #16]");                        // save frame pointer and return address
    emitter.instruction("add x29, sp, #16");                                // set new frame pointer

    // -- convert integer to string and write to stdout --
    emitter.instruction("bl __rt_itoa");                                    // convert x0 to decimal string → x1=ptr, x2=len
    emitter.instruction("mov x0, #1");                                     // fd = stdout
    emitter.instruction("mov x16, #4");                                    // syscall 4 = sys_write
    emitter.instruction("svc #0x80");                                      // invoke macOS kernel
```

To verify alignment, run:
```bash
python3 -c "
with open('path/to/file.rs') as f:
    for i, line in enumerate(f, 1):
        if 'emitter.instruction' in line and '//' in line:
            pos = line.rstrip().index('//')
            if pos != 80 and len(line[:pos].rstrip()) < 80:
                print(f'Line {i}: // at col {pos+1}')
"
```

## Examples

Each example lives in `examples/<name>/main.php` with its own `.gitignore`. To run:

```bash
cargo run -- examples/fizzbuzz/main.php
./examples/fizzbuzz/main
```

## PHP compatibility

**PHP-derived syntax must be 100% compatible with PHP.** When elephc implements a PHP construct (variables, operators, keywords, built-ins), it must behave identically to PHP. This means:

- Variable names, keywords, operators, and built-in function names must match PHP exactly
- Superglobals (`$argc`, `$argv`) must use PHP's syntax (e.g., `$argv[0]`, not `argv(0)`)
- Operator precedence and associativity must match PHP
- String escape sequences must match PHP behavior
- Built-in function signatures must match PHP (argument count, order, types)

When in doubt, test with `php -r '...'` to verify behavior.

**elephc also provides compiler-specific extensions** beyond standard PHP (e.g., `ptr`, `extern`, `buffer<T>`, `packed class`). These features have no PHP equivalent and are not expected to run under the PHP interpreter. They are clearly distinguishable from PHP syntax and exist to enable use cases (FFI, game development, low-level memory access) that PHP cannot address.

## Documentation

The `docs/` directory is the project's complete documentation, organized into three sections:

```

### Astro compatibility

All docs files are Markdown with YAML frontmatter compatible with Astro content collections. Every `.md` file **must** have this frontmatter format:

```yaml
---
title: "Page Title"
description: "One-line description of the page."
sidebar:
  order: N
---
```

- `title` replaces the `# Heading` — do **not** add a top-level `# Title` in the body (Astro renders it from frontmatter)
- `sidebar.order` controls page ordering within its section
- No navigation links (`[← Back]`, `Next:`, etc.) — Astro handles navigation
- Use standard Markdown (CommonMark). No custom shortcodes or Astro components inside docs

### Keeping docs up to date

**Documentation must be kept up to date.** When adding a new feature:

1. **PHP syntax feature** (operator, built-in, statement, etc.) → update the relevant page in `docs/php/`. Add the function signature, parameters, return type, and a short example.
2. **Compiler extension** (pointer, buffer, extern, ifdef) → update the relevant page in `docs/beyond-php/`.
3. **Compiler internals change** (pipeline, codegen, runtime) → update the relevant page in `docs/internals/`.
4. If a feature was previously listed as "not supported", remove that note.
5. If there are known incompatibilities with PHP, document them in `docs/php/types.md` (incompatibilities section).
6. Update `docs/README.md` index if adding a new page.

## Roadmap management

`ROADMAP.md` tracks all planned and completed work, organized by version.

- **Never remove completed items** from a version section. Mark them as `[x]` and leave them under the version they belong to. This preserves the history of what was delivered in each release.
- New work items go under the appropriate future version.
- When all items in a version are completed, the version is considered done — do not move items elsewhere.

## Conventions

- No `Co-Authored-By` lines in commits
- Use commit message prefixes such as `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, or `test:`
- Keep commit messages concise
- Run `cargo test` before committing — all tests must pass
- Zero compiler warnings policy (`cargo build` must be clean)
- Never run `cargo fmt` in this repo. Use targeted manual edits only; global formatting creates noisy churn here.
