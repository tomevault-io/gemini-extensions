└── media/               # User's media files
    ├── avatars/
    └── uploads/
```

### Development Standards
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode, comprehensive type coverage
- **Testing**: Unit tests (Jest), E2E tests (Playwright)
- **Code Quality**: ESLint, Prettier, pre-commit hooks
- **Performance**: Core Web Vitals optimization, lazy loading
- **Security**: CSRF protection, rate limiting, input validation
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

### Key Technical Decisions

1. **GitHub as Single Source of Truth**: All user data lives in GitHub repos
2. **Local Caching Only**: PostgreSQL stores aggregated/cached data, not source data
3. **Cryptographic Signatures**: All posts signed for authenticity
4. **Real-time via Webhooks**: GitHub webhooks + Socket.io for live updates
5. **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works without JavaScript

### Environment Variables Required
```
# GitHub OAuth
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=
GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET=

# Database
DATABASE_URL=
REDIS_URL=

# App Configuration
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=
NEXTAUTH_URL=
APP_ENV=development|production

# Optional Services
SENTRY_DSN=
ANALYTICS_ID=
```

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: All utility functions and API routes
- **Integration Tests**: GitHub API interactions
- **E2E Tests**: Critical user flows (signup, post, follow)
- **Performance Tests**: Feed generation and API response times
- **Security Tests**: Authentication, authorization, data validation

### Deployment Architecture
- **Frontend**: Vercel (Next.js optimized)
- **Backend API**: Railway/Render (containerized Node.js)
- **Database**: Managed PostgreSQL + Redis
- **CDN**: Vercel Edge Network
- **Monitoring**: Sentry for errors, custom metrics for performance

## Success Metrics
- **Technical**: <100ms API response time, 99.9% uptime
- **User Experience**: <3 second page loads, mobile responsive
- **Adoption**: User retention, daily active users, posts per user
- **Network**: Cross-app data portability, third-party integrations

This development plan provides a structured approach to building GitSocial while maintaining flexibility for adjustments based on user feedback and technical discoveries during implementation.
