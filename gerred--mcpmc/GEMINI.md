## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: JSON-RPC Warning

If you find yourself implementing JSON-RPC directly (e.g., writing JSON messages, handling protocol-level details, or dealing with stdio), STOP! You are going in the wrong direction. The MCP framework handles all protocol details. Your job is to:

1. Implement the actual Minecraft/Mineflayer functionality
2. Use the provided bot methods and APIs
3. Let the framework handle all communication

Never:

- Write JSON-RPC messages directly
- Handle stdio yourself
- Implement protocol-level error codes
- Create custom notification systems

## Overview

This project uses the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to bridge interactions between a Minecraft bot (powered by Mineflayer) and an LLM-based client.

The essential flow is:

1. The server starts up ("MinecraftServer") and connects to a Minecraft server automatically (via the Mineflayer bot).
2. The MCP server is exposed through standard JSON-RPC over stdio.
3. MCP "tools" correspond to actionable commands in Minecraft (e.g., "dig_area", "navigate_to", etc.).
4. MCP "resources" correspond to read-only data from Minecraft (e.g., "minecraft://inventory").

When an MCP client issues requests, the server routes these to either:
• The "toolHandler" (for effectful actions such as "dig_block")  
• The "resourceHandler" (for returning game state like position, health, etc.)

## MCP Types and Imports

When working with MCP types:

1. Import types from the correct SDK paths:
   - Transport: "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/shared/transport.js"
   - JSONRPCMessage and other core types: "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/types.js"
2. Always check for optional fields using type guards (e.g., 'id' in message)
3. Follow existing implementations in example servers when unsure
4. Never modify working type imports - MCP has specific paths that must be used

## Progress Callbacks

For long-running operations like navigation and digging:

1. Use progress callbacks to report status to MCP clients
2. Include a progressToken in \_meta for tracking
3. Send notifications via "tool/progress" with:
   - token: unique identifier
   - progress: 0-100 percentage
   - status: "in_progress" or "complete"
   - message: human-readable progress

## API Compatibility and Alternatives

When working with Mineflayer's API:

1. Always check the actual API implementation before assuming method availability
2. When encountering type/compatibility issues:
   - Look for alternative methods in the API (e.g., moveSlotItem instead of click)
   - Consider type casting with 'unknown' when necessary (e.g., `as unknown as Furnace`)
   - Add proper type annotations to parameters to avoid implicit any
3. For container operations:
   - Prefer high-level methods like moveSlotItem over low-level ones
   - Always handle cleanup (close containers) in finally blocks
   - Cast specialized containers (like Furnace) appropriately
4. Error handling:
   - Wrap all API calls in try/catch blocks
   - Use wrapError for consistent error reporting
   - Include specific error messages that help diagnose issues

## File Layout

- src/types/minecraft.ts  
  Type definitions for core Minecraft interfaces (Position, Block, Entity, etc.). Also includes the "MinecraftBot" interface, specifying the methods the bot should implement (like "digArea", "followPlayer", "attackEntity", etc.).

- src/core/bot.ts  
  Contains the main "MineflayerBot" class, an implementation of "MinecraftBot" using a real Mineflayer bot with pathfinding, digging, etc.

- src/handlers/tools.ts  
  Implements "ToolHandler" functions that receive tool requests and execute them against the MinecraftBot methods (e.g., "handleDigArea").

- src/handlers/resources.ts  
  Implements "ResourceHandler" for read-only data fetches (position, inventory, weather, etc.).

- src/core/server.ts (and src/server.ts in some setups)  
  Main MCP server that sets up request handlers, ties in the "MineflayerBot" instance, and starts listening for JSON-RPC calls over stdio.

- src/**tests**/\*  
  Contains Jest tests and "MockMinecraftBot" (a simplified implementation of "MinecraftBot" for testing).

## Tools and Technologies

- Model Context Protocol - an API for clients and servers to expose tools, resources, and prompts.
- Mineflayer
- Prismarine

## Code

- Write modern TypeScript against 2024 standards and expectations. Cleanly use async/await where possible.
- Use bun for CLI commands

## Error Handling

- All errors MUST be properly formatted as JSON-RPC responses over stdio
- Never throw errors directly as this will crash MCP clients
- Use the ToolResponse interface with isError: true for error cases
- Ensure all error messages are properly stringified JSON objects

## Logging Rules

- DO NOT use console.log, console.error, or any other console methods for logging
- All communication MUST be through JSON-RPC responses over stdio
- For error conditions, use proper JSON-RPC error response format
- For debug/info messages, include them in the response data structure
- Status updates should be sent as proper JSON-RPC notifications
- Never write directly to stdout/stderr as it will corrupt the JSON-RPC stream

## Commit Rules

Commits must follow the Conventional Commits specification (https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

1. Format: `<type>(<scope>): <description>`

   - `<type>`: The type of change being made:
     - feat: A new feature
     - fix: A bug fix
     - docs: Documentation only changes
     - style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
     - refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
     - perf: A code change that improves performance
     - test: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
     - chore: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools
     - ci: Changes to CI configuration files and scripts
   - `<scope>`: Optional, indicates section of codebase (e.g., bot, server, tools)
   - `<description>`: Clear, concise description in present tense

2. Examples:

   - feat(bot): add block placement functionality
   - fix(server): resolve reconnection loop issue
   - docs(api): update tool documentation
   - refactor(core): simplify connection handling

3. Breaking Changes:

   - Include BREAKING CHANGE: in the commit footer
   - Example: feat(api)!: change tool response format

4. Body and Footer:
   - Optional but recommended for complex changes
   - Separated from header by blank line
   - Use bullet points for multiple changes

## Tool Handler Implementation Rules

The MinecraftToolHandler bridges Mineflayer's bot capabilities to MCP tools. Each handler maps directly to bot functionality:

1. Navigation & Movement

   - `handleNavigateTo/handleNavigateRelative`: Uses Mineflayer pathfinding
   - Always provide progress callbacks for pathfinding operations
   - Handles coordinate translation between absolute/relative positions
   - Uses goals.GoalBlock/goals.GoalXZ from mineflayer-pathfinder

2. Block Interaction

   - `handleDigBlock/handleDigBlockRelative`: Direct block breaking
   - `handleDigArea`: Area excavation with progress tracking
   - `handlePlaceBlock`: Block placement with item selection
   - `handleInspectBlock`: Block state inspection
   - Uses Vec3 for position handling

3. Entity Interaction

   - `handleFollowPlayer`: Player tracking with pathfinding
   - `handleAttackEntity`: Combat with entity targeting
   - Uses entity.position and entity.type from Mineflayer

4. Inventory Management

   - `handleInspectInventory`: Inventory querying
   - `handleCraftItem`: Crafting with/without tables
   - `handleSmeltItem`: Furnace operations
   - `handleEquipItem`: Equipment management
   - `handleDepositItem/handleWithdrawItem`: Container interactions
   - Uses window.items and container APIs

5. World Interaction
   - `handleChat`: In-game communication
   - `handleFindBlocks`: Block finding with constraints
   - `handleFindEntities`: Entity detection
   - `handleCheckPath`: Path validation

Key Bot Methods Used:

```typescript
// Core Movement
bot.pathfinder.goto(goal: goals.Goal)
bot.navigate.to(x: number, y: number, z: number)

// Block Operations
bot.dig(block: Block)
bot.placeBlock(referenceBlock: Block, faceVector: Vec3)

// Entity Interaction
bot.attack(entity: Entity)
bot.lookAt(position: Vec3)

// Inventory
bot.equip(item: Item, destination: string)
bot.craft(recipe: Recipe, count: number, craftingTable: Block)

// World Interaction
bot.findBlocks(options: FindBlocksOptions)
bot.blockAt(position: Vec3)
bot.chat(message: string)
```

Testing Focus:

- Test each bot method integration
- Verify coordinate systems (absolute vs relative)
- Check entity targeting and tracking
- Validate inventory operations
- Test pathfinding edge cases

Remember: Focus on Mineflayer's capabilities and proper bot method usage. The handler layer should cleanly map these capabilities to MCP tools while handling coordinate translations and progress tracking.

## JSON Response Formatting

When implementing tool handlers that return structured data:

1. Avoid using `type: "json"` with `JSON.stringify` for nested objects
2. Instead, format complex data as human-readable text
3. Use template literals and proper formatting for nested structures
4. For lists of items, use bullet points or numbered lists
5. Include relevant units and round numbers appropriately
6. Make responses both machine-parseable and human-readable

Examples:
✅ Good: `Found 3 blocks: \n- Stone at (10, 64, -30), distance: 5.2\n- Dirt at (11, 64, -30), distance: 5.5`
❌ Bad: `{"blocks":[{"name":"stone","position":{"x":10,"y":64,"z":-30}}]}`

## Building and Construction

When implementing building functionality:

1. Always check inventory before attempting to place blocks
2. Use find_blocks to locate suitable building locations and materials
3. Combine digging and building operations for complete structures
4. Follow a clear building pattern:
   - Clear the area if needed (dig_area_relative)
   - Place foundation blocks first
   - Build walls from bottom to top
   - Add details like doors and windows last
5. Consider the bot's position and reachability:
   - Stay within reach distance (typically 4 blocks)
   - Move to new positions as needed
   - Ensure stable ground for the bot to stand on
6. Handle errors gracefully:
   - Check for block placement success
   - Have fallback positions for block placement
   - Log unreachable or problematic areas

Example building sequence:

1. Survey area with find_blocks
2. Clear space with dig_area_relative
3. Check inventory for materials
4. Place foundation blocks
5. Build walls and roof
6. Add finishing touches
