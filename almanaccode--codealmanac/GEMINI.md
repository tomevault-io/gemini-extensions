codealmanac is a living wiki for codebases, maintained by AI coding agents.

Primary consumer is the AI coding agent; humans benefit secondarily.

**Full spec:** `/Users/rohan/Desktop/Projects/openalmanac/docs/ideas/codebase-wiki.md` — source of truth. Read it before making design changes. This file is the working context for implementation.

## Design philosophy

Intelligence lives in prompts, not pipelines. When judgment is needed — deciding what a session produced, scoring notability, evaluating a proposed page against the graph — we hand a concrete-but-open prompt to an agent. We do not wrap agents in propose/review/apply state machines, intermediate proposal files, or `--dry-run` rehearsals. The writer owns outcomes and calls the reviewer as a subagent when it wants feedback; there is no orchestration JSON schema between them. Everything is **local-only** (`.almanac/` per repo, `~/.almanac/registry.json` globally, no hosted service), the `.almanac/` namespace is **flat** (no `.almanac/wiki/` subdir — future features get peer files), and **the CLI never touches AI except `capture` and `bootstrap`.** Everything else is pure query and organization over a SQLite index.

## Engineering taste

There is no prize for preserving awkward code. Prefer the structure a new maintainer would understand immediately.

- Prefer obvious architecture over local patching when a bug exposes mixed responsibilities.
- Before accepting a solution, ask whether it creates a one-off mechanism where the existing general model could be extended instead. If it does, require an explicit architectural justification: why the general path is insufficient, whether the exception is temporary or permanent, how it is bounded, and what would make it safe to remove or generalize later.
- Existing special conditions are not automatically legitimate just because they are already in the codebase. This project has been built with AI, and AI agents can leave behind locally effective one-off fixes that were never consciously accepted as architecture. Treat extra flags, copied files, fallback paths, bespoke state, provider-specific branches, and helper scripts as provisional until they earn their place.
- Weight special cases by cost and evidence. Do not remove them reflexively; compatibility, migration, safety, platform, and provider constraints can be real. But a narrow exception with high maintenance cost needs stronger justification than a small localized shim.
- Assume the agents using this repo are capable: they can read files, inspect history, follow wiki pages, call tools, and reason over context. Do not build rigid preprocessing, copied context bundles, artificial staging files, or elaborate orchestration solely because an agent might need help. Prefer giving the agent real source material and a clear contract unless there is evidence that the general agentic workflow fails.
- This is an open-source project, so every new tracked file is public surface area and future maintenance burden. Before adding a file, ask who will own it, whether it belongs in an existing prompt/doc/module, and what keeps it from becoming stale.
- Keep modules honest: a file named `auth.ts` should not secretly mean "Claude auth"; a central status file should not know provider-specific details.
- Short files are good, but responsibility boundaries matter more than line count. Split when a file has multiple reasons to change.
- Delete dead compatibility layers once callers have moved. Compatibility shims are temporary bridges, not architecture.
- When code feels ugly, treat that as design feedback. Naming, file shape, and import direction are part of correctness because they teach future agents how to extend the system.

## How we work

### Slice-by-slice

Implementation is split into numbered slices. Each slice gets a plan in `docs/plans/slice-N-*.md` written before code. The plan states scope, out-of-scope, design decisions, file changes, test coverage, and explicit "Read before coding" pointers. After a slice lands, a review finds bugs and omissions; fixes go in a separate `docs/plans/fixes-slice-N-review.md` plan and ship as their own commit. **Write the plan, build, review, fix, then move to the next slice.** Don't collapse slices to save a step — the review pass is where latent bugs surface.

Plans use **must-fix / should-fix / consider** framing for review findings. Must-fix = correctness or contract bug. Should-fix = consistency, structure, or edge case that will bite later. Consider = taste call worth flagging, author decides.

### Background agents

When tasks are independent (e.g., "write slice-3 plan" and "draft reviewer prompt"), dispatch multiple subagents in parallel. Don't serialize work that doesn't need serializing.

### Code review

When the user asks for a code review or reviewer, read `.claude/agents/review.md` first and treat it as the authoritative code-review prompt for this repo. Do not confuse it with `prompts/reviewer.md`, which is the wiki reviewer subagent used by `capture`.

Use code review after meaningful structural changes, especially changes to command flows, provider boundaries, indexer behavior, SQLite queries, prompt contracts, or filesystem writes. The review standard is not "does it pass tests?" but "would a fresh maintainer understand why this is the obvious shape?"

### Commit conventions

- `feat(slice-N): <summary>` — new slice landing
- `fix(slice-N-review): <summary>` — review fixes for slice N
- `docs: <summary>` — plans, research, README, this file
- `refactor(slice-N): <summary>` — structural cleanup within a slice's surface area

Keep commits buildable and test-passing. `npm test` must be green on every commit.

### Testing

Vitest (`npm test` → `vitest run`). Every test that touches `~/.almanac/` or spawns a wiki MUST wrap its body in `withTempHome` from `test/helpers.ts` — it sandboxes `HOME` to a tmpdir so we never touch the real user registry. Use `makeRepo`, `scaffoldWiki`, `writePage` helpers from the same file rather than reinventing fixtures. Structure a slice's test file around the commands/features it adds; extend existing tests rather than rewriting them when a slice layers on top.

## Design decisions

_Cross-cutting architectural choices. Keep current, concise, and explanatory. Update this when a conversation settles a structural choice._

- **Providers own their runtime truth.** Each provider exposes metadata, readiness, and run behavior instead of scattering provider conditionals through commands.
- **`runAgent()` is a compatibility facade.** It stays stable for command callers, but provider modules are the real boundary.
- **Claude is SDK-backed; Codex and Cursor are CLI JSONL-backed.** Keep those transports until a concrete need justifies Cursor SDK or Codex app-server integration.
- **Claude auth lives under the Claude provider.** Generic agent status code should not import Claude-specific auth plumbing.
- **Review prompts are separate by job.** `prompts/reviewer.md` reviews wiki page changes; `.claude/agents/review.md` reviews code architecture and implementation.

## Non-negotiables

Design rules every change must respect. The spec has the full rationale; these are the ones that trip people up.

- **The CLI never reads or writes page content.** Only `capture` and `bootstrap` touch AI or write pages. Every other command operates on `index.db` and the filesystem only.
- **Reindex is silent and implicit.** Every query command compares `pages/*.md` mtimes against `index.db` and rebuilds if stale. No progress bars, no "indexing..." chatter, no opt-in flag. `almanac reindex` is the escape hatch for "I want to force it."
- **Unified `[[...]]` syntax.** One link form, disambiguated by content: contains `:` before `/` → cross-wiki; contains `/` → file ref (trailing `/` = folder); otherwise → page slug. Do not introduce a second link syntax.
- **Use `GLOB` not `LIKE` for path queries**, and **escape `*?[` before concatenating stored paths into a GLOB pattern.** SQLite's `LIKE` treats `_` as a wildcard (spurious matches on `src/my_module/`); `GLOB` treats it literally. A Next.js-style stored path like `src/[id]/page.tsx` contains GLOB metacharacters — unescaped, it matches things it shouldn't. See `fixes-slice-2-review.md` for the bug and fix.
- **Paths are normalized at index time and at query time.** Lowercase (macOS is case-insensitive), forward slashes, no `./` prefix, trailing slash iff directory, no redundant slashes. Normalize on both sides of a comparison.
- **Slugs are kebab-case of the filename.** `checkout_flow`, `Checkout Flow.md`, `checkout-flow.md` all canonicalize to `checkout-flow`. Enforced at write time and checked by health.
- **DAG cycle prevention is belt-and-suspenders.** `CHECK (child_slug != parent_slug)` in the schema, pre-insert cycle check on `topics link`, and a depth cap of 32 on any recursive CTE.
- **Registry entries are never auto-dropped.** Unreachable paths are silently skipped in `--all` queries. `almanac list --drop <name>` is the only explicit removal. Cloning a repo with a committed `.almanac/` that isn't registered triggers silent auto-registration on any command except `init` (which registers explicitly) and `list --drop` (intent is to shrink).
- **Archived pages are excluded from search by default**, are not flagged for dead-refs by `health`, and keep their backlinks resolvable. `--include-archive` and `--archived` change scope.
- **Prompts are shipped from the npm package.** They live in `prompts/` at repo root, are bundled into `files` in `package.json`, and the agent harness reads them from the package install path at runtime. They are not embedded as TS string literals.

## Philosophy anti-patterns

Things we do not do. If a plan proposes one, push back.

- **No propose/apply flows.** No proposal JSON files, no `--apply` or `--confirm` step. Agents write directly; users read the diff in `git status`.
- **No `--dry-run` flags.** The agent is either doing the work or it isn't. Rehearsal is not a feature.
- **No interactive prompts.** The CLI is pipeable and scriptable; scheduled capture runs in the background. Nothing blocks on user input.
- **No pipeline scaffolding where a prompt would do.** If a task calls for judgment, extend the prompt — don't add a pre-processing step in TypeScript that hard-codes the judgment.
- **No state machines between writer and reviewer.** Writer invokes reviewer via `agents: { reviewer }` in the SDK, reads the text critique, decides. No approve/revise/reject enum.
- **No semantic search yet.** FTS5 first. Add vectors only when FTS5 proves insufficient against a real repo.
- **No raw `almanac query`.** The schema is simple; open `index.db` directly if you need to.
- **No `almanac read/write/edit`.** The agent has Read/Write/Edit tools.

## Key file locations

- **Design spec:** `/Users/rohan/Desktop/Projects/openalmanac/docs/ideas/codebase-wiki.md`
- **Slice plans:** `docs/plans/slice-N-*.md`, `docs/plans/fixes-slice-N-review.md`
- **Agent SDK reference:** `docs/research/agent-sdk.md` — version pin, auth, message types, streaming, subagent routing, pitfalls. Read before slice 4 or 5 work.
- **Prompts:** `prompts/bootstrap.md`, `prompts/writer.md`, `prompts/reviewer.md`
- **SQLite schema DDL:** `src/indexer/schema.ts` (single-source, applied idempotently on open)
- **Registry I/O:** `src/registry/index.ts` (atomic read/write) + `src/registry/autoregister.ts` (silent-on-command policy)
- **Walk-up resolver:** `src/paths.ts` — nearest `.almanac/` from a `cwd`, like git's nearest `.git/`
- **Test sandbox helpers:** `test/helpers.ts`
