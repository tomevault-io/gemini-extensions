# Agent Working Rules

Treat the repository as an engineering project: bounded targets, explicit
ownership, risk-proportional validation, and decisions recorded where the work
is. What a change did and why is stated in its commit message, which travels
with the diff through `git log`, `git blame`, and the pull request.

Notes you keep while working — scratch plans, checklists, drafts — belong in
the untracked `plan/` directory. They are a local working area and are not
published.

## Development and Delivery

The cadence is local iteration followed by a delivered pull request. A request
to change the editor proceeds through both stages unless the user explicitly
asks for local-only work or a branch backup instead of publication.

1. **Local iteration.** Continue the current local batch branch, or create
   `codex/local-batch` from current `main` when starting a new batch. Use
   `pnpm dev` for feedback and focused checks for each bounded target. Keep
   separate, explanatory local commits for separate targets. A completed local
   target ends with its commit and validation, then proceeds to Delivery unless
   the user limited the request to local work. A branch pushed only for backup
   is not a delivery.
2. **Delivery.** Open one pull request for the completed change or batch, run
   the mainline delivery gate, queue it for merge, wait for the required
   checks in the merge queue, and verify Production. Every non-documentation merge to `main` follows this one
   route. Batching is optional. A change means one independently useful feature, fix, or
   improvement; supporting tests, repair commits, files, and formatting do not
   count as extra changes. Prepare any intended release version before merging.

Keep a short working list in `plan/local-batch.md` while a batch is in
progress: the branch, completed changes and count, validation still needed,
and current stage. Read it when continuing the batch and reconcile it with
local commit messages; commit count alone is not a change count. Start the next
list after the batch is delivered. Decisions and validation that must survive
delivery belong in the commits and pull request. A squash merge's description
must preserve the target summary, test impact, validation, and unresolved
limitations.

## Operating Discipline

Before starting a target:

1. Run `git status --short --branch` from the repository root.
2. Audit dirty state by ownership:
   - Proceed normally when the worktree is clean.
   - When it is dirty, identify whether each changed path belongs to the
     current target, the user, another worker, or an earlier target.
   - Unrelated dirty paths do not automatically block work.
   - Stop before editing when dirty paths overlap the target's owned files,
     ownership is unclear, or a dirty shared contract affects the target.
   - Say so in the commit message when proceeding with unrelated dirty files
     present.
3. Identify the target owner, goal, expected files, shared dependencies, and
   validation surface.
4. Read `README.md` and any closer domain instructions.
5. Review validation intent before editing:
   - Run `pnpm gate:plan -- --path <expected-path>` for the expected owned
     paths when practical.
   - Expand the selected commands and identify platform, release, generated-
     artifact, and golden-state assumptions.
   - State which gates you chose, and why, in the commit message.

## Before Editing

Know the boundary of the target before editing tracked files: the goal, which
paths it owns, what the dirty state means for it, and which shared contracts
it touches. Hold that in a local note if it helps; the repository does not
require a file for it.

Do not edit outside the target's boundary without deciding, deliberately, that
the boundary has moved.

## During Work

- Keep each target small and reviewable; exclude unrelated cleanup.
- Define a target by one ownership and validation boundary, not by every
  visible symptom. Closely related micro-fixes that share files, contracts,
  and validation belong in one target; independent changes do not.
- Protect shared contracts, generated artifacts, binary assets, and user-owned
  work unless the target explicitly claims them.
- Decide deliberately before expanding scope or taking on a new dependency, and
  say so in the commit.
- Regenerate the advisory gate plan from the real diff with
  `pnpm gate:plan -- --base <base-ref>` before expensive validation. If the
  actual selection differs materially from the gates you chose, revisit the
  choice before proceeding.
- For local iteration, plan and validate the current target's delta rather than
  repeatedly treating the accumulated batch as a new change. Start with focused
  unit/browser checks directly. Run
  `pnpm gate:preflight -- --base <target-base>` before executing selected
  affected, build, or release gates, and use
  `pnpm gate:affected -- --base <target-base>` for the bounded gates the target
  needs. The Test-Impact check reads commit messages, so check its declaration
  after committing. A planned `full-delivery` gate is owed at batch delivery,
  where the merge queue's required checks and the short local check in the
  Mainline Delivery Gate meet it; it is not an instruction to rerun full
  delivery locally, after each edit or before the pull request. Run broader
  local checks earlier when the target's actual risk requires them.
- Prefer the smallest deterministic validation that covers changed behavior,
  direct dependencies, and credible failure risks.
- Add tests when behavior changes, a regression needs protection, or a
  contract is best demonstrated automatically. Do not add tests that merely
  restate an implementation.
- Declare test impact in the commit that changes implementation code, using a
  trailer:

  ```text
  Test-Impact: tests-updated
  Test-Impact: no-test-change — <evidence behavior is unchanged or protected>
  ```

  `pnpm test:impact -- --base <base-ref>` cross-checks the claim against the
  diff: `tests-updated` requires a changed test file, and `no-test-change`
  requires that none changed plus its evidence. CI runs the same check. See
  `docs/testing/README.md` and its contract matrix.

- Keep one primary test layer per behavior. A test mentioning retired input is
  not automatically dead: retain reachable rejection, migration, history, and
  safety boundaries until their replacement is explicit.
- Do not run a full suite by default. Expand from focused checks when the
  change crosses shared contracts or subsystems, carries broader risk, or a
  project gate requires it.
- Use `pnpm test:local <test-paths>` for affected unit contracts and
  `pnpm test:e2e:local <spec-paths> [--grep <pattern>]` for affected
  browser behavior. Both commands cap local concurrency.
- **Run the Gallery census for copying, labels, and netlists.** Tests use tidy
  fixtures, and defects have shipped that only drawings in the Community
  Gallery reach: identities chained by old copies, a supply Pin whose label
  was deleted, a label a person resized. A batch that changes copying or
  placement (`apps/editor/src/features/clipboard/`,
  `apps/editor/src/features/component-insert/`), instance labels
  (`packages/derived/src/instance-label-placement.ts`,
  `packages/edit-engine/src/transaction-instance-annotations.ts`), or netlist
  extraction (`packages/netlist/src/`) runs
  `pnpm gallery:census -- --base <base-ref>` before it is offered for
  acceptance or delivery. It uses the newest private snapshot
  (`node scripts/gallery-private-snapshot.mjs --cached` downloads one) and
  exits non-zero when a drawing newly fails a check, a netlist's text
  changes, or a label stops following its part. Fix each finding, or explain
  it in the commit. A real-data defect it finds also gets a small synthetic
  test in the ordinary suite. The census reads user drawings: it never runs
  in CI, and its reports stay in the untracked `plan/`.
- Use `pnpm verify:branch` when a completed branch crosses enough workspace
  boundaries to justify static checks, all unit tests, one build, and the
  production smoke check. It is not the mainline delivery gate.
- **Production incident exception.** While production is broken, restoring
  service outranks the delivery route: pushing straight to `main` is allowed,
  and so is any shortcut that shortens the outage. This is written down
  because the alternative is worse — a rule that forbids it is a rule people
  break while panicking, and a broken rule protects nothing. Two conditions
  make it a route rather than a hole: it applies only while service is
  actually degraded, not to a change someone is merely in a hurry about; and
  once service is back, the bypass gets a written record — what was broken,
  what was pushed, and which checks were skipped — in the follow-up commit or
  PR. The record is the point. A bypass nobody wrote down is indistinguishable
  from a bypass nobody noticed.
- Gate planning selects validation obligations. Shared-core changes, gate-policy
  changes, and unclassified non-documentation paths require the full fallback
  when delivering the batch; bounded changes use selected focused checks.
  Batching never authorizes skipping a required GitHub check.
- Report unresolved questions in the commit message or a review note; do not
  leave them only in an untracked working note.

## Circuit Asset Rules

- For accepted Symbol geometry or pin-position changes, historical drawing
  layouts and routes may be left for manual repair. Do not audit or repair
  every old design as a prerequisite to completing the current change, or
  add a general migration/compatibility layer just to preserve old layouts.
  A small one-off repair script is appropriate when concrete affected cases
  can be fixed by a few clear, deterministic rules with little effort;
  otherwise leave them for a human. Record known impacts with the change.
- Keep each circuit fixture in its own `netlists/<circuit-name>/` directory.
- Preserve explicit `.subckt` interfaces and instance pin order. Interface
  changes are shared-contract changes and require checking every caller.
- Keep local model files beside the netlist that includes them unless a target
  intentionally introduces a shared model library.
- Do not claim electrical correctness from syntax inspection alone. If the
  target changes electrical behavior, name the simulator, models, analyses,
  corners, and acceptance criteria used—or record why simulation is blocked.
- Never silently replace foundry or vendor model data with illustrative
  values. Label topology-only fixtures and simplified models clearly.

## After Work

Before considering a local target complete:

1. Run the validation the target's risk calls for. A full suite is required
   only when justified by breadth, risk, or project policy.
2. At minimum, run `git diff --check` and `git status --short --branch`.
3. Review the diff, stage only intended files, and commit locally on the batch
   branch. Update the batch working list. Push and merge belong to Delivery; a
   local target can be complete while its batch awaits publication.
4. Write the commit message so it stands alone: what changed, why, the
   validation that backs it, and the `Test-Impact:` trailer. State anything a
   reader would otherwise have to reconstruct — a defect's root cause, a
   contract that moved, or work deliberately left out.
5. Do not automatically extract a reusable lesson. When a human asks, draft a
   candidate under `docs/experience/` with supporting evidence for the human
   to accept, edit, or reject.

## Mainline Delivery Gate

Focused validation is the normal local development loop. Run this delivery
gate when the accumulated batch is ready for Production, using the entire batch
relative to its mainline base. Delivery keeps full unit, release, and performance
protection for the implementation batch while the browser layer is selected by
impact.

Every non-documentation merge deploys directly to the public site. A `v*`
release tag or manual dispatch may redeploy a selected commit only when that
commit is already on `main`; see Deployment rationale and
`docs/deployment.md`.

Before a non-document change is merged or pushed to `main`:

1. Start from a clean dependency state with
   `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`. Run `pnpm setup:e2e` once on a machine that
   does not yet have the matching Playwright Chromium installation.
2. Run `pnpm gate:preflight -- --base <base-ref>`.
3. Run `pnpm gate:affected -- --base <base-ref>` when the plan selects bounded
   affected gates. When it selects `full-delivery`, run the target's focused
   checks locally and let the required merge-queue checks own the single broad
   core run plus the mapped browser contracts. Do not run the same full suite both
   locally and remotely just because publication is next. Run `pnpm gate:full`
   locally when actual risk cannot be represented by the browser map, when it
   calls for pre-push full evidence, or when remote CI is unavailable.

   The default local check before the pull request is short. The merge queue
   already runs `ci:static`, the complete unit suite and `release:verify` on
   the merged candidate, so they are not repeated locally.
   - Typecheck (`pnpm typecheck`) and formatting (`pnpm format:check`).
   - The unit tests of the touched areas, then one `pnpm test:local` for the
     whole suite, which takes about 2.5 minutes and catches a cross-module
     break before it costs a queue cycle.
   - The browser specs the queue maps to the change
     (`node scripts/ci-plan.mjs --base <base-ref>` prints them), plus the
     specs of the areas the change touches.

   Add `pnpm build` and `pnpm release:verify:built` locally only when the
   change touches rendering, export, symbols or packaging, where goldens and
   the bundle budget can move. Run every browser spec locally
   (`pnpm test:e2e:local --workers=4`, about 12 minutes) only for a change
   that ripples through the whole editor: connectivity, the Edit Engine,
   netlist extraction, the Project model or its schema. A derived diagnostic,
   a Gallery feature or a UI fix does not need it, even when the plan names
   `full-delivery`. If a queue check then fails, repair it and queue again,
   rather than going back to running everything locally.
4. Push a review branch, open the pull request and run `gh pr merge <number>`
   right away. On the pull request itself CI only plans the change scope and
   checks the Test-Impact trailers; its two required checks are skipped, which
   GitHub counts as passing. The merge queue then runs them once, on the
   candidate merged with current `main`, and squash-merges it when both pass.
   `Core contracts` runs static contracts, the complete unit/module suite, and
   the release/performance checks on one shared runner. `Browser tests` runs
   only the mapped affected specs, or a small insertion/runtime fallback for
   an unmapped product path. A branch needs a manual update only when it
   conflicts with `main`, not merely because `main` moved. CI has no full browser audit and runs nothing on a
   schedule; `pnpm test:e2e` runs every spec locally when a change needs it.
5. If a queue check fails, the pull request leaves the queue. Keep the target
   active: inspect its log, repair the reported cause, push, and queue it
   again. A successful `git push` is not a
   completed delivery.

Do not bypass the gate by weakening, skipping, or deleting a failing check.
When a test or golden is obsolete, demonstrate that the accepted behavior is
preserved and update the contract deliberately. If the check cannot run in the
local environment, record the limitation and require the remote green result.

## Where the Record Lives

The automatic per-target loop is:

```text
bounded target -> implementation -> validation -> commit that explains itself
```

The cross-target experience layer is human-triggered:

```text
human reviews commits, failures, or review notes
-> human requests extraction
-> Agent drafts an evidence-backed candidate lesson
-> human accepts, edits, or rejects it
```

Git owns the record. A commit message owns the intent, the reasoning, the
validation, and the test-impact declaration for exactly the change it carries,
so the two can never drift apart. An experience note under `docs/experience/`
owns only a transferable judgment supported by evidence, and a human decides
whether something is a lesson.

Working notes under `plan/` are untracked. They are yours while a target is in
flight; anything that matters afterwards belongs in the commit.

## Boundary and Hygiene Rules

- Do not mix unrelated targets in one commit.
- Do not mix reusable workflow changes with project artifacts unless the commit
  explains why they must land together.
- Do not use model confidence as the only quality gate when deterministic
  validation or human review is available.
- Do not add or run unnecessary content-hash checks. SHA256 verification is
  prohibited unless a concrete security or integrity requirement makes it
  essential; ordinary build provenance, deployment and functional acceptance
  must not grow repeated payload hashing steps.
- Do not delete review notes or open questions to make the repository appear
  clean. Unresolved work is reported, not tidied away.
