# ML4T Skills, Authoring Guide

**Location**: This repository
**Purpose**: 61 standalone agent skills that teach quant ML techniques correctly
**Distribution**: Standalone repo, ships via ML4T website as bonus resource for readers

## Current State

- The repository currently contains 61 `SKILL.md` files across the 10 categories below.
- The active maintenance objective is API accuracy: keep every `## Production Implementation` section aligned with the published `ml4t-*` library APIs.
- The conceptual teaching pattern remains fixed: concept-first, library-recommended (80/20), with no `ml4t.*` imports before `## Production Implementation`.
- If docs or existing skills conflict with current library source, treat library source as ground truth and update the skill/docs rather than preserving stale wrappers.
- Repo-local authoring guidance lives in `AGENTS.md`. Runtime state, memory, transitions, and other project-management artifacts belong under `.workspace/` and are not part of the public distribution.

## Distribution

The canonical distribution is this Git repository: category directories at the repo root, each containing standalone `SKILL.md` files. Skills are plain Markdown with YAML frontmatter, so release archives or direct file copies also work. There is no package-manager build step and no generated registry required.

Skill discovery is one level deep, at `<skills-dir>/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`, so the
category directories in this repo have to be flattened at install time. That is
what `scripts/install.sh` does; do not document a bare clone into a skills
directory, because it silently installs nothing.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ml4t/skills.git ~/.ml4t-skills
~/.ml4t-skills/scripts/install.sh              # ~/.claude/skills
~/.ml4t-skills/scripts/install.sh .agents/skills
```

The repo itself must not check in runtime folders such as `.agents/`, `.claude/`, `.codex/`, or `.workspace/`. Those are local-only state.

### Frontmatter portability
- `name`, `description`, `metadata`, portable across all runtimes
- `when_to_use`, `paths`, `dependencies`, Claude Code extensions, ignored by Codex
- `description` includes "Use when..." trigger language so Codex implicit matching works without `when_to_use`

## Design Philosophy: Concept-First, Library-Recommended (80/20)

Each skill teaches the **concept and correct pattern** using standard tools (sklearn, polars, numpy, pytorch, lightgbm). The last ~20% recommends ml4t-* libraries as the production-grade implementation. Skills are useful without the libraries but naturally showcase them.

**Critical rule**: No `ml4t.*` imports before the "Production Implementation" section.

## SKILL.md Template

Every skill is a single file named `SKILL.md` (uppercase) in its own directory.

```markdown
---
name: ml4t-{skill-name}
description: {What it does}. {When to use it}.
dependencies: [{prerequisite-skill-names}]
metadata:
  book_chapters: "7, 9"
  library: "ml4t-diagnostic"
---

# {Concept Title}

{1-2 sentence problem statement: what goes wrong without this.}

## The Problem

{Why this matters. Concrete example of failure. 3-5 sentences.}

## The Pattern

{Correct approach using standard tools.}

### WRONG
\```python
# Naive approach that looks right but fails
{wrong code}
\```

### CORRECT
\```python
# Correct approach with standard tools
{right code}
\```

## {Additional concept-specific sections}

## Guardrails

- {Specific red flag with detection pattern}

## Production Implementation

`ml4t-{library}` provides a validated implementation:

\```python
from ml4t.{module} import {Class}
{5-10 lines max}
\```

## Checklist

- [ ] {Verification step}
```

## Design Rules

1. **80/20 split**: No `ml4t.*` imports before the Production Implementation section
2. **WRONG/CORRECT pair is mandatory**, the single highest-value pattern for agents
3. **120 lines or fewer** (5000 tokens). Use `references/` subdirectory if more detail needed
4. **Checklist at the end**, agents use these as verification steps
5. **Description is third-person** with trigger keywords ("Use when...")
6. **File named `SKILL.md`** (uppercase, per agentskills.io standard)
7. **Book reference in metadata only**, content is self-contained
8. **No "QuantLab" branding**, use actual library names (`ml4t-data`, `ml4t-engineer`, etc.)
9. **`quantlab_module` field is BANNED**, use `metadata.library` instead
10. **Standard tools in examples**: sklearn, polars, numpy, scipy, pytorch, lightgbm, statsmodels

## Frontmatter Schema

```yaml
name: ml4t-{directory-name}        # Must match directory
description: "..."                  # Third-person, includes "Use when..."
dependencies: [skill-names]         # Other ml4t-* skills (without prefix)
metadata:
  book_chapters: "7, 9"            # Comma-separated chapter numbers
  library: "ml4t-diagnostic"       # Which ml4t-* library (if any)
```

**Banned fields**: `quantlab_module`, `category`, `type` (these are implicit from directory).

## Skill Taxonomy (10 Categories)

| # | Category | Skills | Coverage |
|---|----------|--------|----------|
| 1 | `concepts/` | 10 | Foundational pitfalls and principles |
| 2 | `data/` | 7 | Data sourcing, validation, management |
| 3 | `features/` | 10 | Labels, feature engineering, selection, latent factors |
| 4 | `validation/` | 8 | CV, evaluation, multiple testing |
| 5 | `backtest/` | 5 | Strategy simulation, cost modeling |
| 6 | `portfolio/` | 5 | Position sizing and risk |
| 7 | `advanced-ai/` | 5 | Chapter 24 autonomous-agent patterns |
| 8 | `production/` | 2 | Live trading and monitoring |
| 9 | `infrastructure/` | 4 | Schema, registry, Polars, pipelines |
| 10 | `workflows/` | 5 | End-to-end composite processes |

## Quality Gates

A skill is done when it passes all five:

| Gate | Check |
|------|-------|
| **Structure** | `SKILL.md` naming, valid frontmatter, 120 lines or fewer, no `quantlab_module` |
| **80/20 split** | No `ml4t.*` imports before Production Implementation section |
| **Content** | All code blocks syntactically valid, import paths correct, chapter refs correct |
| **Agent utility** | Has WRONG/CORRECT pair, ends with checklist, guardrails are specific |
| **Integration** | Dependencies exist, no content overlap, cross-refs valid |

## Verified API Reference

Ground truth for all Production Implementation sections. Verified from library source.

### ml4t-data
- `from ml4t.data import DataManager, ContractSpec, FUTURES_REGISTRY, Config, BaseProvider, AssetClass`
- `DataManager` is the generic fetch/storage manager.
- Use `fetch(...)`, `batch_load(...)`, and `batch_load_universe(...)` for retrieval patterns.
- `DataManager.load(...)` is a storage operation, not a dataset-registry API like `load("etfs")`.
- There is no generic `load("us_equities")` or `load(datasets=[...], as_of_date=...)` API in the library.
- Book-style managers live in subpackages:
  - `from ml4t.data.etfs import ETFDataManager`
  - `from ml4t.data.futures import FuturesDataManager, ContinuousContractBuilder, build_continuous_contract`
- `WikiPricesProvider` is the survivorship-bias-free historical US equities source through 2018.
- `FREDProvider.fetch_ohlcv(..., vintage_date=...)` is the current point-in-time macro API.
- `ContractSpec`, `FUTURES_REGISTRY`, futures contract specs
- `Config`, `BaseProvider`, `AssetClass`

### ml4t-backtest
- `Strategy` (ABC), `on_data(timestamp, data, context, broker)`, `on_start(broker)`, `on_end(broker)`
- `Broker`, `submit_order()`, `get_position()`, `close_position()`, `cancel_order()`, `get_cash()`
- `Engine`, `run_backtest()`, `DataFeed`
- `BacktestConfig`, `BacktestResult`, `CommissionType`
- Current engine usage: `Engine(feed, strategy, config).run()` or `run_backtest(prices=..., strategy=..., signals=..., context=..., config=...)`
- `BacktestConfig` uses primitive commission/slippage fields like `commission_type`, `commission_rate`, `slippage_type`, `slippage_rate`
- `BacktestResult` metrics live under `result.metrics[...]`; tearsheet/export helpers include `to_equity_dataframe()`, `to_daily_returns()`, and `to_tearsheet()`
- Types: `OrderType`, `OrderSide`, `OrderStatus`, `ExecutionMode`
- Risk: `StopLoss`, `TakeProfit`, `TrailingStop`, `RuleChain`
- Execution: `RebalanceConfig`, `TargetWeightExecutor`
- Cost models live in `ml4t.backtest.models`, not package root:
  - Commission: `NoCommission`, `PercentageCommission`, `PerShareCommission`, `TieredCommission`, `FuturesCommission`
  - Slippage: `NoSlippage`, `FixedSlippage`, `PercentageSlippage`, `VolumeShareSlippage`

### ml4t-engineer
- `compute_features(data, features)`, main API (list of names, list of dicts, YAML path)
- `FeatureCatalog`, `feature_catalog`, 120+ feature discovery
- `feature_catalog.list(...)` is the current discovery method
- `MLDatasetBuilder`, `create_dataset_builder(features, labels, dates=None, scaler="standard")`
- Use `builder.split(cv)` for CV folds; older helper patterns like `walk_forward()` / `get_train()` are stale
- Registry feature names are canonical names like `mom`, `rsi`, `realized_volatility`, `adx`
- `compute_features(...)` is safest for single-series or per-symbol pipelines; explicit grouped Polars logic is still required for panel-aware features
- `PreprocessingPipeline`, `StandardScaler`, `MinMaxScaler`, `RobustScaler`
- Features: `from ml4t.engineer.features.momentum import macd, rsi, adx`
- Labeling:
  - `from ml4t.engineer.config import LabelingConfig`
  - `from ml4t.engineer.labeling import triple_barrier_labels, atr_triple_barrier_labels, meta_labels, compute_bet_size`
- Storage:
  - `from ml4t.engineer.store import OfflineFeatureStore`
  - Current store API is DuckDB-backed: `save_features(...)`, `load_features(...)`, `point_in_time_join(...)`

### ml4t-diagnostic
- Splitters: `CombinatorialCV`, `WalkForwardCV` (in `ml4t.diagnostic.splitters`)
  - **NOT** `CombinatorialPurgedCV`, that name does not exist
- Stable integration surface for metrics/workflows is `ml4t.diagnostic.api`
- Package root reliably exports `Evaluator`, `EvaluationResult`, `ValidatedCrossValidation`, `FeatureSelector`, `SelectionReport`
- Metrics from `ml4t.diagnostic.api`: `cross_sectional_ic_series`, `compute_ic_hac_stats`, `compute_permutation_importance`, `compute_shap_importance`
- Advanced evaluation helpers live under submodules:
  - `ml4t.diagnostic.metrics`: `compute_ic_by_horizon`, `analyze_feature_outcome`
  - `ml4t.diagnostic.evaluation.stationarity`: `analyze_stationarity`
  - `ml4t.diagnostic.evaluation.drift`: `analyze_drift`
  - `ml4t.diagnostic.evaluation.stats`: `benjamini_hochberg_fdr`, `robust_ic`, `compute_pbo`, `deflated_sharpe_ratio`, `deflated_sharpe_ratio_from_statistics`
- `TradeAnalysis`, `PortfolioAnalysis`, `BarrierAnalysis`, `TradeShapAnalyzer`, `FeatureDiagnostics`, `FactorAnalysis`

### ml4t-live (`from ml4t.live import ...`)
- `LiveEngine`, live trading engine
- Brokers: `AlpacaBroker`, `IBBroker`
- Feeds: `AlpacaDataFeed`, `IBDataFeed`, `DataBentoFeed`, `CryptoFeed`, `OKXFundingFeed`
- Safety: `SafeBroker`, `LiveRiskConfig`, `VirtualPortfolio`
- **Key**: Reuses `Strategy` from `ml4t.backtest`, zero code changes for live deployment
