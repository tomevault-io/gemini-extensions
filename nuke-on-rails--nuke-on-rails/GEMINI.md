## nuke-on-rails

> Full health and security audit for Rails apps, the review a principal engineer would do. Runs rubycritic, Brakeman, bundler-audit and ruby_audit, triages every finding with the LLM as judge, applies OWASP Top 10 lenses for what scanners miss, and returns one impact-ranked action plan. Use for a Rails project audit, a security and health check, "nuke on rails", or a deep review of a vibecoded Rails app.


# Nuke on Rails

A full project health audit for Rails apps: *what to refactor, what's vulnerable, and in what order to attack it*. Three deterministic engines do the scanning; you are the judge. The output is **one single list, prioritized by impact**, never tool sections stapled together.

**Respond in the user's language.** Write the step announcements and the final report in whatever language the user writes in. (These instructions and the lenses are authored in English, but the audit you produce should speak to whoever ran it.)

This audit takes minutes, so announce each step as you begin it and the user sees progress. The examples below show the format in English; translate them to the user's language: `🔭 Step 1/5 — installing & running engines…`, `🎯 Step 2 — picking hotspots (churn × complexity)…`, `⚖️ Step 3 — triaging N findings & applying lenses…`, `📋 Step 5 — building the impact-ranked report…`. One short line per step; the visible tool calls fill in the rest.

## Step 0 — Detect the project

- **Rails app** (`config/application.rb` exists, or the `rails` gem is in the Gemfile): run the full audit.
- **Plain Ruby** (Gemfile or gemspec, no Rails): graceful degradation — rubycritic and bundler-audit run, Brakeman is skipped. Say so explicitly in the report header.
- **Neither**: stop and tell the user this skill audits Ruby/Rails projects.

**Ruby version trap.** A `.ruby-version` (or `Gemfile`-pinned Ruby) often names a version not installed on this machine — common in unfamiliar or AI-generated repos, and it makes rubycritic and brakeman abort before producing output. The engines do static analysis and don't need the app's exact Ruby. If the pinned version is missing, run them under an available Ruby (e.g. set a temporary `.ruby-version`, or invoke via `rbenv local <installed>` / a system Ruby) rather than failing — and note the substitution in the report. Never install the pinned Ruby just to satisfy the lock.

## Step 1 — Install and run the engines

Zero-dependency principle: the skill brings its own tools. Never touch the app's Gemfile.

```sh
gem list rubycritic -i || gem install rubycritic
gem list brakeman -i || gem install brakeman          # Rails only
gem list bundler-audit -i || gem install bundler-audit
gem list ruby_audit -i || gem install ruby_audit
```

Then run them all and capture machine-readable output (commands validated on a real Rails 8 app):

```sh
OUT=$(mktemp -d)
rubycritic app --format json --no-browser --path "$OUT/rubycritic"   # --path keeps output files out of the audited repo
brakeman --format json --quiet -o "$OUT/brakeman.json"               # Rails only
bundle-audit update                                                  # update the db in a separate step:
bundle-audit check --format json > "$OUT/bundler-audit.json"         # --update mixed in pollutes the JSON on stdout
(cd "$OUT" && ruby-audit check)                                      # run OUTSIDE the app dir — inside a bundled
                                                                     # project the executable fails to load (Ruby 3.4+);
                                                                     # make sure the app's Ruby version is still active
```

If an engine fails, degrade gracefully: report which engine was skipped and why, and continue with the others.

## Step 2 — Decide where to spend context (churn × complexity)

Use rubycritic's churn × complexity data to pick the hotspots: files that are both complex **and** change often. Those are the files you read deeply. Never review the codebase uniformly — a complex file nobody touches is a lower priority than a moderately complex file that changes every week.

**Churn needs git history — verify it before trusting the quadrant.** rubycritic derives churn from `git log`, so a shallow clone (`--depth 1`) or a freshly-initialized repo gives every file the same churn (1 or 0) and the quadrant silently collapses to noise — common exactly in the unfamiliar-repo case this skill targets. If churn is uniform across modules, say so and fall back to ranking by complexity and smell density (rubycritic wraps Reek/Flay/Flog — use the per-module `smells` and `complexity`, not just the score). When possible, unshallow first (`git fetch --unshallow`).

## Step 3 — Triage security findings (you are the judge, not the scanner)

For every Brakeman warning and every bundler-audit CVE:

1. **Read the actual code path.** Confirm the finding is reachable in this app, or kill it as a false positive.
2. **Explain the exploit path** for confirmed findings: who can trigger it, from where, with what impact.
3. **Adversarial verification before it enters the report.** Security findings are held to a higher bar than quality findings: a weak quality finding gets ignored; a false security claim burns trust. If you cannot articulate the exploit path, downgrade it to "theoretical" — never present it as confirmed.

Treat Brakeman's confidence level (`High`/`Medium`/`Weak`) as a prior, not a verdict: a `Weak` warning you confirm by reading the code outranks a `High` warning on an unreachable path. And if `config/brakeman.ignore` exists, re-triage every silenced warning — in an unreviewed codebase, an ignore file often means "made CI pass", not "verified safe".

For dependency and Ruby-version CVEs, apply `lenses/cve.md` to the bundler-audit and ruby_audit output — it covers deduping, severity priors, reachability triage, insecure gem sources, and the network cross-checks (day-zero and second-opinion) that close the advisory database's lag and coverage gaps.

Then apply the security lenses to the routes file, the sensitive controllers and models, and the production config:

- `lenses/authorization.md` — IDOR, missing authorization, attack surface
- `lenses/authentication.md` — auth stack, Devise config, custom strategies, sessions
- `lenses/secrets.md` — committed keys and hardcoded credentials
- `lenses/hardening.md` — TLS, CSP, CSRF config, mounted dashboards, uploads
- `lenses/api.md` — JSON over-exposure, CORS, rate limiting, webhooks (skip if the app has no JSON endpoints)
- `lenses/cryptography.md` — encryption oracles, hand-rolled crypto, weak hashing, plaintext sensitive columns
- `lenses/logging.md` — sensitive data in logs, missing audit trail on security-critical events

They cover what Brakeman can't reach. Lenses *cover* those areas; they do not *guarantee* them. Be explicit about that distinction in the report.

## Step 4 — Quality review of the hotspots

Apply `lenses/code-quality.md` — the thermo-nuclear standards, translated to the Rails idiom — to the hotspot files from Step 2. That lens is the default quality bar for this skill: ambitious structural findings, not cosmetic nits.

## Step 5 — The report (output)

This section is the single source of truth for how the report reads: language, tone, structure, and the closing summary. Write the whole report in the user's language (see the top of this file).

**Open with a short status banner** — just write it, don't print a "Status banner" label. A few lines of orientation: project type and Rails/Ruby versions (note any substitution, e.g. running under a different Ruby), whether git history made the churn quadrant reliable, the engines that ran with headline counts, and one honest line on coverage (lenses cover, they don't guarantee). Give it a dry, deadpan wit — it's a tool named *Nuke on Rails* (English example, for tone only: "The good news: the app isn't on fire. The bad news: I found the matches."). **Write the joke natively in the user's language** so it actually lands; never translate the example literally. Humor lives in the framing only; every finding stays sober and precise.

Then the findings, as one list ranked by impact:

1. **Confirmed exploitable security findings** (an IDOR in a payments controller outranks everything).
2. **CVEs** actually reachable from the app's usage.
3. **High-churn × high-complexity quality hotspots** (a fat model that changes weekly outranks a theoretical warning).
4. **Theoretical security warnings** that survived triage but lack a demonstrated exploit path.
5. **Remaining quality findings**, worst first.

**Keep each finding tight and scannable.** Lead with a one-line headline: severity, what it is, and where (`file:line`). Then a sentence or two, max, on why it matters here and the concrete fix. Show code only when a few lines make the point faster than words. No multi-paragraph exploit essays: a senior should grasp each finding in seconds and know the next move. Write the way Rails reads — friendly, direct, no ceremony. Don't print scaffolding labels ("Status banner", "Findings"); let the report flow.

**Close with a scoreboard and a plan** so the reader leaves with a number and a next move:

1. **A severity scoreboard** — counts at a glance, as a table:

   | Severity | Count |
   |----------|-------|
   | 🔴 Critical | … |
   | 🟠 High | … |
   | 🟡 Medium | … |
   | 🟢 Low | … |

   Add a line beneath it for dependency risk (reachable CVEs, e.g. "92 advisories / 24 gems") and any end-of-life flag.

2. **Fix now** — the few highest-impact items, each one line with `file:line` and the move. This is the "if you do nothing else" list.
3. **Fix next** — the remaining high/medium, grouped tersely.
4. **Biggest structural multiplier** — one line naming the single refactor that removes the most risk or debt at once.

The whole thing reads like a plan a principal engineer would hand you, not a tool dump.
