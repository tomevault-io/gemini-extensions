Sibling repos checked out next to this one (paths depend on local layout):

- `nexus-next/` — on-chain Move packages (`sui/primitives`, `sui/interface`,
  `sui/registry`, `sui/workflow`), example TAPs (`sui/examples/demo_tap`),
  and the off-chain leader (`be/leader/`). Its `sui/bin/publish.sh` and
  `sui/bin/test_demo.sh` are the canonical localnet bring-up and demo driver.
- `nexus-tools/`, `nexus-workbench/`, `nexus-api/` — sibling repos consumed
  by docker-compose workbenches.

## SDK conventions

- **High-level actions** live in `sdk/src/nexus/<area>.rs`. Each action takes
  `&self` on the `*Actions` struct (held by `NexusClient`), submits via the
  shared signer/gas/crawler, and returns a typed `*Result` struct. Free-
  function `fetch_*` helpers (e.g. `fetch_registry`) live in the same
  file when they're useful without a full client.
- **PTB builders** live in `sdk/src/transactions/<area>.rs` and take
  `&mut TransactionBuilder` plus `&NexusObjects`. They never read from the
  network; they only emit move calls/inputs. Pair an action with one PTB
  builder per logical transaction.
- **Errors** flow through `NexusError` (`Wallet`, `Configuration`,
  `TransactionBuilding`, `Rpc`, `Parsing`, `Timeout`, `Channel`, `Storage`).
  Pick the variant that matches the root cause; only `Configuration` is
  string-typed.
- **On-chain decoding**: prefer `crawler.get_object::<T>` (JSON) for SDK
  types that implement `Deserialize` against Sui's Move-JSON, and
  `crawler.get_object_contents_bcs::<T>` for objects whose layout is best
  decoded from raw BCS. Dynamic field readers
  (`get_dynamic_fields_bcs`, `get_dynamic_object_fields`) sit on top of both.
- **ID derivation** uses `derive_tool_id`, `derive_tool_gas_id`,
  `derive_walk_execution_event_task_id`, etc. Never reimplement the
  ascii-string / BCS-blake2b derivation in shell or Python.
- **Struct reuse comes before new structs.** Before adding any new Rust struct, inspect the existing structs in the related SDK/CLI/type module and confirm that none of them, and no reasonable modification of them, can satisfy the new purpose. If a new struct is still necessary, add a short doc comment or nearby comment that states exactly what is missing from the closest existing struct and why modifying that existing struct would be wrong.

## Move binding

The Move binding refresh is **not type only**. It refreshes the committed
canonical package IR for each Nexus Move package. The reduced framework support
IR remains pinned to the SDK. The generated Rust surface in
`sdk/src/move_bindings` is the ABI boundary for Move types, type tags, BCS and
serde implementations, and typed call targets. Rust domain modules may add
helpers on top, but they should not duplicate Move ABI logic.

How the pipeline fits together:

- **Refresh half (on demand through `just sdk rebind`)**:
  `sdk/src/bin/regenerate_bindings.rs` fetches each Nexus package's normalized IR
  through `sui_move_codegen::fetch_package`, replaces concrete Nexus package
  identities with stable SDK binding slots, normalizes the unused deployment
  version, and writes committed JSON under
  `sdk/src/move_bindings/ir/<package>.json`. The reduced `move_std` and
  `sui_framework` IR files remain unchanged and are rendered alongside the five
  refreshed Nexus package files.
- **Offline half (every build)**: `sdk/build.rs` reads the committed IR and
  renders one `$OUT_DIR/<package>_types.rs` file per package. The rendered Rust
  includes generated Move structs, enum variants, type tags, serde and BCS
  implementations, and function call targets. The rendered files are never
  committed.
- **Wiring**: `sdk/src/move_bindings/mod.rs` scopes generated packages through
  `with_nexus_scope`, includes the rendered output, and exposes extension
  modules from `sdk/src/move_bindings/extensions`. Runtime PTB builders call
  generated `*_target` functions instead of hand written package, module, and
  function strings.

Key invariants:

- Framework packages are scoped to their fixed addresses: `move_std` uses
  `0x1`, and `sui_framework` uses `0x2`.
- Normal Nexus regeneration does not rewrite framework IR. Update that support
  surface explicitly only when the pinned Sui version changes.
- Committed Nexus IR uses stable binding slots: `primitives` uses `0xa1`,
  `interface` uses `0xa2`, `registry` uses `0xa3`, `workflow` uses `0xa4`, and
  `scheduler` uses `0xa5`. These slots describe the canonical SDK package
  graph and are not deployment package IDs. The unused package object version
  is normalized to `1`.
- Nexus package call targets use the current package ids from `NexusObjects`.
  Type identity uses the defining package id where Sui upgrades keep type tags
  pinned to the original package.
- Generated binding output is derived from committed IR. If a Move function,
  struct, enum, field, or signature changes, regenerate the IR and fix Rust
  call sites against the generated compiler errors rather than patching
  generated output by hand.

### Regenerating the bindings

Run this after the on chain Move in Nexus changes identifiers, signatures,
functions, or datatypes. The command expects a deployment objects TOML plus a
reachable Sui gRPC endpoint. From the SDK workspace:

```bash
just sdk rebind {your_path_to_objects_toml}
```

You can pass the gRPC endpoint as the second argument when it is not
`http://127.0.0.1:9000`:

```bash
just sdk rebind {your_path_to_objects_toml} http://127.0.0.1:{grpc_port}
```

Network package metadata does not contain Move function parameter names. Pass
a matching Move source root as the third argument when source names should be
restored:

```bash
just sdk rebind \
  {your_path_to_objects_toml} \
  http://127.0.0.1:{grpc_port} \
  {your_path_to_nexus_contracts}
```

The recipe runs `sdk/src/bin/regenerate_bindings.rs` with the
`binding_codegen` feature. The binary reads package ids from
the supplied deployment manifest, fetches normalized Nexus package metadata
over gRPC, optionally overlays trusted source parameter names, and writes the
refreshed Nexus JSON under `sdk/src/move_bindings/ir/`. The reduced `move_std`
and `sui_framework` IR files are not fetched or rewritten. Without a source
root, parameter names remain deterministic `argN` values. Source input does not
replace signatures, types, or abilities from the network.

Before writing, regeneration replaces every current and original Nexus package
ID, including cross package type references, with its stable SDK binding slot.
It also normalizes the package object version, which is not consumed by the
renderer. The concrete deployment remains authoritative for the fetched ABI,
while redeploying the same ABI does not change the committed IR. Runtime
`NexusObjects` supplies current package IDs for calls and original package IDs
for type identity. The recipe does not start Sui, publish packages, or run
`cargo check`; run the normal SDK checks after regeneration.

The committed artifact to review is the JSON diff under
`sdk/src/move_bindings/ir/`. `sdk/build.rs` renders Rust bindings from that JSON
during normal builds, so a dropped or renamed generated target should be
treated as an on chain API move and fixed at the call site.

## CLI conventions

- **Module layout per command group** (`cli/src/<group>/mod.rs`):
  1. `mod tap_xxx;` for each subcommand handler file.
  1. `use { … }` block bringing handler functions and SDK result types into
     the module scope.
  1. `#[derive(Subcommand)] enum <Group>Command { … }` with one variant per
     subcommand; each `#[command(about = …)]` annotation feeds `--help`.
  1. Optional nested `enum <Sub>Command { … }` for two-level groupings (e.g.
     `EndpointCommand`, `PaymentsCommand`).
  1. `pub(crate) async fn handle(command: <Group>Command) -> AnyResult<(), NexusCliError>`
     dispatcher that destructures each variant into a flat handler call.
- **Per-subcommand handler** (`cli/src/<group>/<group>_<command>.rs`):
  1. `command_title!("…")` for human progress.
  1. `let nexus_client = get_nexus_client(sui_gas_coin, sui_gas_budget).await?;`
     (omit gas args for read-only commands).
  1. Drive the SDK action and unwrap the result.
  1. `notify_success!` for human feedback.
  1. `json_output(&<group>_<command>_result_json(&result))?;` — JSON output
     is stable and consumed by scripts; keep keys flat and snake_case.
- **JSON-shape helpers** (`<group>_<command>_result_json`) live next to
  their handler. They take typed SDK results and emit `serde_json::Value`
  with the keys the CLI documents. Always cover them with a unit test that
  asserts each top-level key — this catches accidental field renames.
- **The global `--json` flag** is stored in `JSON_MODE: AtomicBool` (see
  `cli/src/prelude.rs`). Interactive prompts and progress spinners must
  check `JSON_MODE.load(Ordering::Relaxed)` and short-circuit when set.

## Testing patterns

- **Unit tests** sit next to their implementation in `#[cfg(test)] mod tests`.
  - Bring the parent module in with `use super::*;` and supplement with
    `crate::{fqn, sui::traits::*, test_utils::{nexus_mocks, sui_mocks}}`
    plus `tonic::Status` when you need to fake gRPC errors.
  - Use `sui_mocks::grpc::MockLedgerService`, `MockTransactionExecutionService`,
    `MockSubscriptionService` to expect gRPC calls.
  - For full transaction flows use
    `mock_execute_transaction_and_wait_for_checkpoint` and pass the response
    objects your handler depends on.
  - Use `sui_mocks::grpc::mock_server` + `nexus_mocks::mock_nexus_client` to
    materialise an end-to-end client against the mocked server.
  - `mock_get_object_metadata` / `mock_get_object_json` /
    `mock_get_object_bcs_for` cover the three read paths; return a tonic
    `Status::not_found` directly for "object missing" cases.
- **CLI dispatch tests** in `cli/src/tap/mod.rs::tests` and similar verify
  every clap variant reaches a local boundary (e.g. missing-RPC error)
  before any network call. Add a new arm whenever you add a subcommand.
- **JSON-shape tests** for `*_result_json` helpers assert each documented
  top-level key with `assert_eq!(json["x"], …)`.

## Comment patterns

- Avoid unnecessary and extraneous comments around self explanatory code. Code
  should be written in such a way that it doesn't require a sea of comments in
  the first place.
- Add `//!` brief module descriptions to each module. Highlighting what the
  responsibility and purpose of that module is. Update this comment after any
  changes made to each module.
- Prefer doc-comments `///` to inline comments `//` where possible
- Only use inline comments to clarify potentially confusing logic within
  functions. These comments should be concise (1-2 lines maximum).
- `///` doc comments can be more verbose if the struct or the function require it.

## Step-by-step: adding a new feature

1. **Add the SDK primitive** under `sdk/src/nexus/<area>.rs`:
   - Define the params and result structs near the existing ones.
   - Add the `impl <Area>Actions { pub async fn … }` method.
   - If a new PTB shape is required, extend `sdk/src/transactions/<area>.rs`
     with a builder that takes `&mut TransactionBuilder` and the relevant
     `NexusObjects` refs/idents.
   - Reuse existing typed models (`sdk/src/types/<area>.rs`) and identifier
     constants (`sdk/src/idents/<package>.rs`) — only add new types when an
     on-chain shape genuinely changed.
1. **Wire the SDK helper into the CLI**:
   - Create `cli/src/<group>/<group>_<command>.rs` with a handler that
     calls the SDK and a `*_result_json` helper.
   - Add a `mod` line and import in `cli/src/<group>/mod.rs`.
   - Add a `#[derive(Subcommand)]` variant (or a nested `enum`) with clap
     attributes that match the SDK's parameter types.
   - Route the variant in `handle(command: <Group>Command)`.
1. **Add tests**:
   - SDK: at minimum one happy-path mock test and one failure-mode test
     per branch in the new function. Cover the gRPC error path with
     `Status::not_found` and the parse-failure path with a constructed bad
     response.
   - CLI: dispatch test that the new variant reaches the missing-RPC
     boundary, plus a JSON-shape unit test for each new `*_result_json`.
1. **Update documentation**:
   - `docs/cli.md` — add a command block in the existing `### nexus <group>`
     section. Follow the established `**\`nexus … [--flag <VALUE>]\`\*\*`header
style and the`{% hint style="info" %}…{% endhint %}` callouts.
   - `CHANGELOG.md` — append bullets to `## [Unreleased]` under the matching
     `### nexus-cli` / `### nexus-sdk` / `### nexus-toolkit` / `### docs`
     sections; `#### Added`, `#### Changed`, `#### Fixed`, `#### Removed`
     are the allowed verbs.
1. **Verify** (in this order):

   ```bash
   just pre-commit cargo-check          # cargo check --locked --workspace --bins --examples
   just pre-commit cargo-nextest-run    # cargo nextest run --locked --fail-fast … (needs docker)
   just pre-commit cargo-clippy         # cargo clippy --locked --all-targets --all-features
   just pre-commit cargo-nightly-fmt    # cargo +<nightly> fmt --all --check
   ```

   The fmt step is **required**: `rustfmt.toml` uses several unstable
   options (`imports_granularity`, `group_imports`, `reorder_impl_items`,
   …) that the stable rustfmt rejects. `cargo-nightly-fmt` resolves the
   pinned nightly from `.nightly-version` (currently `nightly-2025-01-06`)
   automatically; install it with
   `rustup toolchain install "$(cat .nightly-version)" --component rustfmt`
   if you don't have it yet.

1. **Run the equivalent `just` recipes** when in doubt — they wrap the
   above with the right toolchain selection:

   ```bash
   just sdk check && just sdk test && just sdk fmt-check
   just cli check && just cli test && just cli fmt-check
   just pre-commit cargo-nightly-fmt
   ```

## Definition of done

A change is "done" only when **all** of the following pass:

- `cargo +stable check` and `cargo +stable test` for every touched
  crate (`-p nexus-sdk -p nexus-cli` at minimum).
- `cargo +nightly fmt --all --check` (use the pinned `.nightly-version`).
- New public SDK items have rustdoc that explains the _why_, not only the
  _what_; non-obvious branches (timeouts, idempotency, error mapping) get
  a one-liner.
- New CLI subcommands are listed in `docs/cli.md` with the same flag
  ordering and naming as `--help`, and have a corresponding bullet in
  `CHANGELOG.md` under `[Unreleased]`.
- Pre-existing tests still pass — keep an eye on flaky CLI tests that
  share `HOME` / `$SUI_RPC_URL` / `$SUI_PK`; they use `serial_test::serial`
  for a reason, never run them concurrently without that attribute.

## When in doubt

- Read [STYLE_GUIDE.md](STYLE_GUIDE.md) for markdown rules
  (markdownlint-enforced) — ordered list items use `1.` for every entry
  (MD029 style `1/1/1`); emphasis uses `*asterisks*`, not underscores
  (MD049).
- Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for commit-message conventions
  (Conventional Commits, imperative tense) and the pre-commit hook setup
  (`./.pre-commit/pre-commit --install`).
- The on-chain Move source lives in the sibling `nexus-next` repo —
  cross-check struct layouts, function signatures, and idents there
  before guessing.
