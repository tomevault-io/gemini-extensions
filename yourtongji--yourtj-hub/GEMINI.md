## 1. What this is

yourtj-hub is the monorepo for the Tongji university campus forum platform (brand: yourtj, distinct from
the archived YourTJ-Platform). The forum is the core product — a **direct modification of the upstream
GooseForum, keeping the single-binary deployment**. Unified auth (built-in OIDC Provider), search (Meilisearch), and
cross-platform points (credit, `Planned`) are shared infrastructure subdomains. Database, search, and structure may all
be changed, but the "Go + Vue in one binary, frontend go:embed into the binary" deployment shape is kept.

- Forum: **Go 1.26 + Gin + Vue 3 + Tailwind**, at `apps/gooseforum` (fork of upstream; module path
  `github.com/YourTongji/YourTJ-Hub/apps/gooseforum`, diverged from upstream's `github.com/leancodebox/GooseForum`).
- Backend layers (upstream structure): `app/bundles` (utilities) → `app/models` (GORM models) →
  `app/service` (business) → `app/http/controllers/{api,forum}` (JSON API + GoHTML three-mode rendering).
- Frontend: `apps/gooseforum/resource` (Vue 3 + Vite, site/admin dual entry), built output
  `resource/static/dist` go:embed; GoHTML templates in `resource/templates` keep server-side rendering (three-mode).
- Database: **PostgreSQL is the default deployment database** (`deploy/config.toml.example`
  `[db.default] connection = "postgres"`); SQLite stays the local development/test default
  (`apps/gooseforum/config.toml`, in-memory tests); the file db (`[db.file]`) is fixed SQLite.
  MySQL is **not supported**.
- Search: **Meilisearch** (`config.toml [meilisearch]`, optional); aggregate search (topics/users/
  categories, pinyin/initials) landed (issue #22); event-driven index sync, rebuildable projection.
- Mobile: **Flutter** (`apps/mobile`, melos workspace, Riverpod, **Partial**).
- Auth: GitHub OAuth (goth) + **built-in OIDC Provider** (`/api/oauth`, authorization code + PKCE S256,
  RS256 id_token, opaque access tokens, numeric `sub` = users.id); TOTP 2FA and session management
  (`jti` + `user_sessions`) in place.
- Contract: **Partial** — `packages/api-contract/openapi.yaml` is the controlled contract center for
  password login, login public-key retrieval, TOTP login verification and account management, logout,
  mobile OIDC exchange, session management (list/revoke/revoke-all), topic writing, forum core
  interactions (post create/update/delete/window/revisions, topic status/delete/like/bookmark/watch,
  post like/bookmark, follow-user, report), user account and identity (captcha, user-card,
  profile/email/username/avatar/badge settings, upload-avatar, change-password, OAuth
  bindings/unbind), notifications/unread/chat, forum moderation workbench, the admin console
  (`/api/admin/*`: user/role/category/moderator management, topic/post moderation, agent
  administration, operation records, traffic overview, page settings, site settings, data
  import/export), account
  registration/password recovery (`/api/register`, `/api/forgot-password`, `/api/reset-password`),
  the six-operation Agent forum API, course catalog reads + review write/moderation, the Wiki domain
  (public tree/namespaces/home + admin read-only tree + sync/status|sync|sync/runs +
  sync/webhook-secret + asset CDN + webhook; the legacy in-forum write/revision/rollback/diff/editor
  and namespace-CRUD endpoints were retired with the GitHub-SSoT model),
  and the PK scheduler (14 ops:
  courses-by-major/optional-types/courses-by-nature/course-details/course-search/courses-by-time/
  latest-update/course-info-sync/course-review-brief),
  the user content lifecycle (my-content/deleted-content lists, content-restore/batch-delete/
  purge/event, account-close), aggregate search (`/api/forum/search`) and public
  site statistics,
  the sticker library (`GET /api/forum/stickers` public enabled list + `/api/admin/`
  `stickers`/`sticker-save`/`sticker-delete`/`sticker-import` admin CRUD and zip pack
  import; token `[:sticker:name:]` expanded server-side at render for posts/replies and
  client-side in chat bubbles (web segmented renderer) and mobile (markdown pre-expansion +
  inline image spans) via the public list API, MADR 0030),
  with lint/bundle, generated TypeScript types, fixtures, and route-level HTTP tests;
  paths are split per domain under `paths/`. Route coverage (issue #277) is complete:
  `route-coverage.json` knownUncovered is empty — every non-excluded `/api` route has a
  contract operation; new routes must be added to the contract or the exclusion list.
- Points: forum-local ledger mechanics are `Current`, durable reward delivery is `Partial`;
  cross-platform credit settlement is `Planned`. See `docs/product/credit-and-escrow.md`.

## 2. Repository layout & boundary rules

```
apps/
  gooseforum/  The forum itself (upstream fork; module path github.com/YourTongji/YourTJ-Hub/apps/gooseforum)
    main.go            Entry point (cobra: serve / migrate / seed-demo / seed-stickers / mock-topics / mock-posts / rebuild-search-index ...)
    config.toml       Runtime config (gitignored; bring your own locally)
    app/              Go backend (bundles/console/datastruct/http/migration/models/service)
    resource/         Vue 3 frontend + gohtml templates + @gooseforum/client package
    docs/             Fork-owned docs (maintained in this monorepo, not reference-only)
  status/      Independent Vue status site + Netlify Functions/Blobs (status.yourtj.de)
  mobile/      Flutter melos workspace (core/auth/ui_kit/forum_app)
packages/
  api-contract/  openapi.yaml + gen scripts + fixtures + contract tests (Partial)
services/
  search/    Meilisearch deployment config
  credit/    Cross-platform credit settlement (Planned placeholder)
deploy/      Per-environment compose + env.example
docs/        Docs center (product/architecture/development/operations)
```

**Boundary rules**
- `apps/gooseforum` is the only place the forum is implemented; business logic in `service`, data access
  in `models`/repository layer, HTTP in `http/controllers`.
- Cross-domain access goes through the owner's public API; no foreign SQL against other domains' tables.
- Frontend output only via `resource/static/dist` (go:embed); the backend proxies `/assets` to Vite :3010 in dev,
  single binary in production.
- `services/` holds deployment configs only, not third-party source (Meilisearch/credit are
  off-the-shelf components).
- Upstream sync: `git merge` upstream main; resolve conflicts with "our changes win" and record it. After
  merging, rewrite upstream's `github.com/leancodebox/GooseForum` import prefix to
  `github.com/YourTongji/YourTJ-Hub/apps/gooseforum` (upstream files keep the old prefix), then run `go mod tidy`.

## 3. Hard constraints

- Forum deployment shape is a **single binary** (go:embed webdist/static-dist); no nginx/CDN split.
  The independent public status app (`apps/status`) deploys its Vue assets and Functions to Netlify,
  with no runtime dependency on the forum. See `docs/operations/status-netlify.md`.
- User IDs must be **numeric** (uint64) — credit's `GetID()` only accepts numeric sub; the built-in
  OIDC Provider always issues `sub` = users.id (uint64 decimal string).
- The forum `users` table is the identity source; the forum JWT is a session credential, not identity
  truth, and is never issued to external OIDC clients.
- For OpenAPI-covered operations, contract changes ship in the same PR: backend behavior/structs →
  `openapi.yaml` → generated TypeScript output → fixture contract tests. Until the pipeline fully
  covers an operation, contract changes must also update the mobile Dart mirrors in
  `apps/mobile/packages/core/lib/src/gen/` (same PR) and web TS types
  (`resource/packages/client/src/contracts/`) in the same commit. Dart generation remains Planned.
  Route coverage is gated: every route from `RegisterByGin` (snapshot
  `packages/api-contract/fixtures/routes-snapshot.json`, regenerate with
  `YOURTJ_UPDATE_ROUTES_SNAPSHOT=1 go test ./app/http/routes/ -run TestRoutesSnapshot`) must be an
  OpenAPI operation or listed in `packages/api-contract/route-coverage.json`, and the generated
  `packages/api-contract/coverage-matrix.md` must be committed — `pnpm run check` and CI fail otherwise.
- Design-token changes ship in the same PR: changing `resource/src/styles/tokens.css` requires
  updating `apps/mobile/packages/ui_kit/lib/src/theme/tokens.json` in the same commit.
- Web `serverMessages` changes ship in the same PR: changing `server`/`serverMessages` keys in
  `resource/src/locales/{zh,en,ja,de}.ts` requires regenerating the mobile mirror catalog
  `apps/mobile/packages/forum_app/lib/src/server_message_catalog.dart` (`node
  apps/mobile/tools/generate_server_messages.mjs`) in the same commit. The gate is `pnpm check`
  in `apps/gooseforum/resource`: four-locale key consistency, static `t()` registration, and
  mirror-catalog freshness.
- Docs use the four implementation status words (`Current`/`Partial`/`Planned`/`Decision needed`),
  see docs/README.md.
- Docs describe only the currently supported model — no timeline or milestones
  (see docs/development/documentation.md).
- Any new feature PR must include documentation changes: user-visible features update the docs center
  and status words; purely internal changes at least update the relevant README or code comments
  (see docs/development/documentation.md).
- config.toml contains signingKey — never commit it (gitignored).
- Research files goto research/, and should not be included in git.

## 4. Verification
- Run only the checks relevant to the change locally; CI owns the full repository-wide gate matrix.
  Before push, lefthook pre-push runs `go vet ./...` + `golangci-lint run` (incremental against
  `origin/dev`, full fallback) + `pnpm typecheck` + the web i18n gate `pnpm check` (see `make hooks`).
- Bug fixes start red: write the smallest failing test first, run it to confirm the failure, then
  implement and turn it green. Mechanical changes (rename, formatting, dependency bump, docs-only)
  are exempt; the regression test stays.
- TODO markers use three tiers (`FIXME` / `TODO` / `XXX`), see
  docs/development/coding-conventions.md.
- Test layout follows the per-language convention (Go `*_test.go` co-located, frontend `resource/test/`,
  Flutter `test/`, contract fixtures under `packages/api-contract/fixtures/`), see
  docs/development/testing.md#test-layout.

- Backend: `cd apps/gooseforum && go vet ./... && go test ./...` (use `GOPROXY=https://goproxy.cn,direct`
  if module fetch times out). **Any model/migration change must also pass the PostgreSQL migration
  tests**: `YOURTJ_TEST_PG_URL="host=127.0.0.1 port=5432 user=postgres password=postgres dbname=postgres sslmode=disable" go test ./app/migration/ -run 'PostgreSQL|Postgres' -v`
  (including `TestSchemaMigratesOnPostgreSQL` and `TestSchemaUpgradeCreatesNewTablesOnPostgreSQL` in
  `app/migration/migration_pg_test.go`; spin up `postgres:16-alpine` locally — CI additionally runs
  all app PG tests in `ci-backend-pg`). MySQL-only type tags (`bigint unsigned` / `datetime` / `tinyint`)
  break PG and are forbidden in models (MySQL itself is not supported).
- Web: `cd apps/gooseforum/resource && pnpm typecheck && pnpm test && pnpm check && pnpm build`
  (`pnpm check` is the i18n gate; output into resource/static/dist)
- Full build: `make build` (resource → go build single binary `bin/yourtj-hub`)
- Smoke: run `./bin/yourtj-hub serve` then curl the homepage/API (port from config.toml, default 5234)
- Report the commands actually run and their results; a local subset is not CI passing.
- Governance gates: `node scripts/run-gates.mjs` (doc links / placeholders / manifest /
  decisions MADR / postmortem format; seeded by repo-seed, owned by `.repo-seed/manifest.json`). Fast — run early.

## 5. Git & PR discipline

- `dev` is the main development line: create `feat/<topic>` / `fix/<topic>` / `docs/<topic>` from
  `origin/dev`, open PRs against `dev`; CI builds and auto-deploys `dev` to the test instance.
- `main` is the production site: changes reach it through PR + CI. `Release / main` merges the
  release PR, publishes a server tag and dispatches production deployment on that tag (see
  `docs/operations/deployment.md`). Never develop directly on `main` or `dev`.
- The dev instance syncs a consistent snapshot of the main database on each deploy (see
  `docs/operations/deployment.md`), so DB migrations are rehearsed on dev before reaching main.
- Stage only files this task owns; leave unrelated dirty/untracked files alone.
- Commit/push/open a PR only when the user explicitly asks.
- Never push to protected branches; releases go through PR + CI.
- Commit messages use concise conventional types (`feat:`/`fix:`/`docs:`/`refactor:`/`chore:`).
