  `/app/vendor/settings/domain/` — Vendor domain settings page

**Kauvex Country Domains (15):**
  kauvex.com (US/Global — USD), kauvex.co.uk (UK — GBP), kauvex.ca (Canada — CAD),
  kauvex.com.au (Australia — AUD), kauvex.ng (Nigeria — NGN), kauvex.in (India — INR),
  kauvex.ae (UAE — AED), kauvex.de (Germany — EUR/DE), kauvex.fr (France — EUR/FR),
  kauvex.com.gh (Ghana — GHS), kauvex.co.ke (Kenya — KES), kauvex.co.za (South Africa — ZAR),
  kauvex.sa (Saudi Arabia — SAR), kauvex.com.br (Brazil — BRL), kauvex.jp (Japan — JPY)

**Domain Types:**
  `core` — kauvex.com + subdomains (admin, seller, logistics, etc.)
  `kauvex_country` — Country-specific TLDs (kauvex.co.uk, kauvex.ca, etc.)
  `vendor_subdomain` — {shop}.kauvex.com
  `vendor_custom` — merchants own domain (e.g., mystore.com)
  `whitelabel` — Enterprise white-label domains

**Middleware Routing Logic:**
  1. Kauvex country TLDs → set storefront headers (currency, country, language)
  2. Root domain + path → /ng, /uk, /ca, /au, etc. storefront routing
  3. Core subdomains → rewrite to admin/vendor/logistics/etc.
  4. Vendor subdomains → rewrite to (stores)/{vendor-slug}/
  5. Custom domains → rewrite to (stores)/{hostname}/
  6. Protected subdomains require auth cookie

**API Endpoints:**
  GET /api/v1/domains/check-availability?subdomain= — Check subdomain availability
  POST /api/v1/domains/provision — Provision subdomain or custom domain
  GET /api/v1/domains/status?vendor_id= — Get domain status
  DELETE /api/v1/domains/remove?vendor_id=&domain= — Remove domain
  GET /api/v1/domains/country-domains — List all 15 country TLDs with status
  POST /api/v1/domains/country-domains — Provision all pending country domains
  POST /api/v1/domains/whitelabel — Provision white label domain
  GET /api/cron/ssl-check — SSL certificate status check (cron)

**Database Tables (kv_dom_ prefix):**
  kv_dom_domains — All domains (core, country, vendor, custom, whitelabel)
  kv_dom_subdomain_checks — Subdomain availability check history
  kv_dom_ssl_checks — SSL certificate status tracking
  kv_dom_dns_events — DNS provisioning event log

**Critical Rules:**
  Country domains are KEPT ACTIVE — never removed on vendor cancellation
  Vendor subdomains use wildcard CNAME — no per-vendor DNS needed
  Custom domains require vendor to add CNAME at their registrar
  SSL is auto-provisioned by Vercel for verified domains
  Middleware sets x-storefront-* headers for downstream use by storefront context
