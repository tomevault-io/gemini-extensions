# CAMI Development - Claude Agent Management Interface

**CAMI Source Code Repository**

This is the CAMI development repository. You are working on the Go codebase that powers CAMI's MCP server and CLI.

---

## Claude Context: CAMI Developer Assistant

**You are assisting with CAMI development** - working on the Go codebase that implements the Model Context Protocol (MCP) server and CLI for Claude Code agent management.

**Your Focus Areas:**

1. **Go Development** - Write clean, idiomatic Go code following the project's patterns and conventions.

2. **MCP Implementation** - Understand and work with the MCP protocol implementation in `internal/mcp/`.

3. **Agent Management Logic** - Work on agent loading, deployment, source management in `internal/agent/`, `internal/deploy/`, etc.

4. **Cross-Platform Support** - Ensure code works on macOS, Linux, and Windows.

5. **Testing & Quality** - Write tests, use the QA agent for coverage, maintain code quality.

**Development Workflow:**

- Use `go run ./cmd/cami` for local testing
- The `.mcp.json` in this repo uses `go run` for zero-setup development
- Run `make build` to compile binary
- Run `make test` for tests
- Run `make lint` for code quality checks
- Use deployed agents (qa, agent-architect) for development tasks

**Remember:** This is the CAMI source code repo. Users install CAMI via releases and get a clean `~/cami-workspace/` workspace with templates from `install/templates/`.

---

## Architecture Overview

### Single Binary, Dual Modes

```bash
# MCP Server Mode (primary) - for Claude Code
$ cami --mcp
# Runs as MCP server on stdio for Claude Code integration

# CLI Mode (secondary) - for scripting and quick checks
$ cami list
$ cami deploy frontend backend ~/projects/my-app
$ cami scan ~/projects/my-app
```

### User Workspace Structure

CAMI creates a user workspace at `~/cami-workspace/` during installation:

```
~/cami-workspace/                          # User workspace (created by installer)
├── CLAUDE.md                    # User-facing CAMI documentation
├── README.md                    # User quick start guide
├── .mcp.json                    # Local MCP config
├── .gitignore                   # Git ignore rules
├── config.yaml                  # CAMI configuration
├── .claude/
│   └── agents/                  # CAMI's own agents
├── sources/                     # Agent sources
│   ├── my-agents/              # User's custom agents
│   ├── team-agents/            # (if added)
│   └── fullstack-guild/        # Example: guild added via add_source

/usr/local/bin/cami             # Binary (on PATH)
```

**Key Concepts:**
- User workspace is separate from source code repo
- Templates live in `install/templates/` in this repo
- Installer copies templates to `~/cami-workspace/` during setup
- Users can optionally track `~/cami-workspace/` with Git

### Configuration Format

User's `~/cami-workspace/config.yaml`:

```yaml
version: "1"
install_timestamp: 2025-01-18T10:30:00Z  # When CAMI was installed
setup_complete: true                      # Whether initial setup is complete
agent_sources:
  - name: team-agents
    type: local
    path: ~/cami-workspace/sources/team-agents
    priority: 50
    git:
      enabled: true
      remote: git@github.com:yourorg/team-agents.git

  - name: my-agents
    type: local
    path: ~/cami-workspace/sources/my-agents
    priority: 10
    git:
      enabled: false

deploy_locations:
  - name: my-project
    path: ~/projects/my-project

default_projects_dir: ~/projects  # Where new projects are created by default
```

**New in v0.3.2**:
- `install_timestamp`: Automatically set during installation (used for robust fresh install detection)
- `setup_complete`: False on fresh install, true after adding real agent sources
- Existing configs are automatically migrated on first load

**Priority-based deduplication**: When the same agent exists in multiple sources, the lowest priority number wins (my-agents: 10 > team-agents: 50). Priority 1 = highest, 100 = lowest.

## Development Setup

### This Repository (Dev Mode)

This repo has `.mcp.json` configured for development:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cami": {
      "command": "go",
      "args": ["run", "./cmd/cami", "--mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Open this directory in Claude Code and CAMI runs automatically via `go run`.

### Building

```bash
# Build for current platform
make build

# Build for all platforms
make release-all

# Package releases with installer
make package

# Install locally (creates ~/cami-workspace/ workspace)
make install
```

### Testing

```bash
# Run tests
make test

# Run linters
make lint

# Test installation
make install
cd ~/cami-workspace
claude  # Test user experience
```

## Installation Templates

User workspace files are in `install/templates/`:

```
install/
├── templates/
│   ├── CLAUDE.md        # User-facing CAMI persona doc
│   ├── README.md        # User quick start guide
│   ├── .gitignore       # Git ignore for user workspace
│   └── .mcp.json        # Local MCP config (uses 'cami' on PATH)
└── install.sh           # Installation script
```

When modifying the user experience:
- Update templates in `install/templates/`
- Update installer in `install/install.sh`
- Test with `make install` and check `~/cami-workspace/`

cami --help                         # Show full help
```

**Note**: The CLI is designed for power users and automation. For most users, interacting through Claude Code via MCP tools is recommended.

## Agent Discovery and Priority

### Multi-Source Deduplication

When the same agent exists in multiple sources, CAMI uses priority-based deduplication:

```yaml
agent_sources:
  - name: fullstack-guild
    priority: 100        # Public guilds (lowest priority)

  - name: team-agents
    priority: 50         # Team-specific (medium priority)

  - name: my-agents
    priority: 10         # Personal overrides (highest priority)
```

**Example**: If "frontend" agent exists in all three sources, the version from `my-agents` (priority 10) is used because lower numbers = higher priority.

### Agent Versioning

Each agent has a version in its frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: frontend
version: 1.1.0
description: Use this agent when building user interfaces...
---
```

CAMI tracks versions to detect when updates are available via `scan_deployed_agents`.

## Agent Classification System

### Overview

CAMI v0.4.0+ includes a three-class agent system that organizes agents by cognitive model and work style. Each class has different phase weights for the universal three-phase methodology (Research → Execute → Validate).

### The Three Classes

| Class | User-Friendly Name | Purpose | Phase Weights |
|-------|-------------------|---------|---------------|
| **workflow-specialist** | Task Automator | Execute specific, user-defined workflows | Research 15% → Execute 70% → Validate 15% |
| **technology-implementer** | Feature Builder | Build complete capabilities in specific domains | Research 30% → Execute 55% → Validate 15% |
| **strategic-planner** | System Architect | Architect systems, research, optimize at scale | Research 45% → Execute 30% → Validate 25% |

### Agent Schema

Agents include optional `class` and `specialty` fields in frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: frontend
version: "1.1.0"
description: Use this agent PROACTIVELY when building user interfaces...
class: technology-implementer
specialty: react-development
---
```

**Fields**:
- `class` (optional): One of `workflow-specialist`, `technology-implementer`, or `strategic-planner`
- `specialty` (optional): Domain/specialty (e.g., `kubernetes-operations`, `react-development`, `system-architecture`)

### Code Implementation

**Agent Struct** (`internal/agent/agent.go`):
```go
type Agent struct {
    Name        string `yaml:"name"`
    Version     string `yaml:"version"`
    Description string `yaml:"description"`
    Class       string `yaml:"class,omitempty"`
    Specialty   string `yaml:"specialty,omitempty"`
    // ...
}
```

**Phase Weights** (`internal/agent/agent.go`):
```go
// GetPhaseWeights returns phase distribution for an agent
func (a *Agent) GetPhaseWeights() PhaseWeights {
    return GetPhaseWeightsByClass(a.Class)
}

// GetPhaseWeightsByClass maps class to phase percentages
func GetPhaseWeightsByClass(class string) PhaseWeights {
    // Returns default balanced weights if class not specified
}

// GetUserFriendlyClassName returns "Task Automator", "Feature Builder", etc.
func GetUserFriendlyClassName(class string) string {
    // Maps technical names to user-friendly names
}
```

### Auto-Classification

**Agent-architect v3.0.0+** automatically classifies agents based on request signals:

- **Workflow Specialist**: Requests mention checklists, procedures, workflows, repeatable processes
- **Technology Implementer**: Requests about building features, implementing capabilities, domain-specific work
- **Strategic Planner**: Requests about architecture, research, planning, optimization, high-level decisions

### Workflow Gathering (CAMI's Role)

CAMI (not agent-architect) gathers class-specific information before invoking agent-architect:

**For Workflow Specialists**:
- Offers 3 input methods: describe conversationally, provide file, or point to docs
- Gathers step-by-step workflow with success/failure criteria
- Confirms workflow before agent creation

**For Technology Implementers**:
- Asks about technology/framework versions
- Identifies integration points
- Notes patterns and conventions

**For Strategic Planners**:
- Understands constraints (timeline, budget, scale, team size)
- Identifies key tradeoffs
- Maps current state vs desired state

This separation ensures agent-architect focuses on agent generation while CAMI handles conversational requirements gathering.

### Backward Compatibility

- Fields are optional (`omitempty` in YAML)
- Existing agents without class/specialty continue to work
- Default balanced weights (30/50/20) used if class not specified
- Parser handles both old and new frontmatter formats
