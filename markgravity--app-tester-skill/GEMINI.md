# App Tester

Tests app navigation flows by driving the device with `agent-device`, a unified CLI for iOS,
Android, macOS, tvOS, and Android TV (real devices and simulators).

**Strategy**

1. Read the project's navigation source to build `.tester/app-graph.yaml` and
   `.tester/flows/*.yaml` at the project root.
2. Instrument screen files with structured print/console.log lines and accessibility
   identifiers (`testID` / `Semantics` / `.accessibilityIdentifier()`).
3. Drive flows by `open` → `snapshot -i` → `press`/`fill`/`scroll` → confirm via console
   logs → `close` — all via `agent-device`.
4. Take screenshots **only when a step fails**, and write them to `/tmp/` —
   **never** under `.tester/`. The `.tester/` directory is reserved for the graph
   (`app-graph.yaml`) and flow YAML files; screenshots, snapshots, and logs are
   ephemeral debugging artifacts and belong in `/tmp/`.

## Requirements

- **`agent-device`** — the only runtime dependency. `npm install -g agent-device` (Node ≥22).
- Platform SDKs for the **build** step only:
  - iOS / macOS / tvOS: Xcode + Command Line Tools.
  - Android: Android SDK + ADB on PATH (`$HOME/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools`).
  - Flutter: `~/fvm/versions/stable/bin/flutter` or `flutter` on PATH.
  - Expo / React Native: Node + the project's package manager.
- macOS Accessibility permission for desktop automation (System Settings → Privacy &
  Security → Accessibility, on first run).

## Routing into agent-device help

`agent-device` is the source of truth for command syntax — it ships versioned help that this
skill is intentionally not duplicating. Whenever you need exact flags or new commands, run:

```bash
agent-device --version
agent-device help workflow      # canonical session loop + selectors
agent-device help debugging     # logs, network, performance, react-devtools
agent-device help macos         # macOS-specific notes
agent-device help remote        # device farms / cloud
```

If `agent-device --version` reports `< 0.14.0`, upgrade before using this skill — older CLIs
lack the help topics above.

## Canonical session loop

```text
open <app>  →  snapshot -i  →  get / is / find  →  press / fill / scroll / wait  →  verify  →  close
```

Snapshots assign refs (`@e1`, `@e2`, …) to current-screen elements. Refs from the most recent
snapshot are immediately actionable. If a target appears only in an off-screen summary, use
`scroll <direction>` and re-snapshot until it's visible.

A minimal flow step:

```bash
agent-device open com.example.YourApp --platform ios
agent-device snapshot -i                                 # find @e for the action
agent-device press --label "Create Game"                 # or: press @e3
# verify via app logs (see "Log confirmation" below)
agent-device close
```

> Always look up exact selectors and flags via `agent-device help workflow` rather than guessing.

---

## Sensitive Credentials (.env)

Some flows require authentication. Store credentials in `.env` at the project root (add to
`.gitignore`):

```bash
TEST_USERNAME=your@email.com
TEST_PASSWORD=yourpassword
TEST_PERMISSIONS=camera,location,notifications      # iOS only
SYSTEM_PROMPT_DISMISS=Ask App Not to Track,Don't Allow,Allow Once,Not Now,Dismiss,OK,Allow
```

Load before testing: `export $(grep -v '^#' .env | xargs)`

---

## Step 0: Project Setup

Identify these values once before any phase.

**iOS / macOS / tvOS (SwiftUI / UIKit):**

| Value | How to find it |
|---|---|
| **Platform** | `SUPPORTED_PLATFORMS` in build settings — `macosx`, `iphonesimulator`, `appletvsimulator` |
| **Bundle ID** | `PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER` in build settings or Info.plist |
| **App name** | `CFBundleDisplayName` / `CFBundleName` in Info.plist or Xcode scheme name |
| **Screen files** | Directory containing `*View.swift` or `*ViewController.swift` |
| **Navigation source** | File with Screen/Route enum or coordinator |
| **Log prefix** | `[AppName]` — used in all instrumentation |

**Android / Flutter:**

| Value | How to find it |
|---|---|
| **Platform** | Presence of `android/`. Flutter = `pubspec.yaml` present |
| **Package ID** | `applicationId` in `android/app/build.gradle(.kts)` |
| **App name** | `android:label` in `AndroidManifest.xml` |
| **Screen files** | Flutter: `lib/features/*/screens/` or `lib/screens/` (`*Screen.dart` / `*Page.dart`) |
| **Navigation source** | Flutter: GoRouter config, or files with `GoRoute` / `Navigator.push` calls |
| **Device serial** | `adb devices` — e.g. `emulator-5554` |
| **Log prefix** | `[AppName]` — used in `print()` calls |

**Expo / React Native (iOS + Android):**

Identify by `package.json` containing `expo` or `react-native`. Expo Router projects also have
an `app/` directory with file-based routes.

| Value | How to find it |
|---|---|
| **Platform** | `package.json` has `expo` → Expo. `react-native` only → bare RN |
| **Bundle ID (iOS)** | `app.json` → `expo.ios.bundleIdentifier`, or `ios/<App>/Info.plist` |
| **Package ID (Android)** | `app.json` → `expo.android.package`, or Android `applicationId` |
| **App name** | `app.json` → `expo.name`, or `app.config.{js,ts}` |
| **Router type** | `app/` directory exists → **Expo Router** (file-based). Otherwise `@react-navigation/*` |
| **Screen files** | Expo Router: `app/**/*.tsx` + `src/features/*/screens/*.tsx`. Bare RN: `src/screens/` |
| **Navigation source** | Expo Router: the `app/` tree. Bare RN: `NavigationContainer` + `Stack.Navigator` config |
| **Log prefix** | `[AppName]` — used in `console.log()` |

---

## Phase 1: App Discovery

Run when `.tester/app-graph.yaml` does not exist, the navigation source has changed, or the
user says "rebuild the graph".

### 1.1 Read the navigation source

Find files defining all screens / routes:
- **NavigationStack / FlowStacks**: a `Screen` or `Route` enum with all cases
- **Coordinators**: `navigate(to:)` calls covering all destinations
- **UIKit**: router with `push` / `present` calls
- **Flutter / GoRouter**: files with `GoRoute` definitions or `context.go()` / `context.push()`
- **Flutter / Navigator**: `Navigator.push()` / `Navigator.pushNamed()` call sites
- **Expo Router**: the `app/` tree — each `.tsx` file is a route

### 1.2 Read every screen file

For each screen extract:
- Outgoing navigation calls (`push`, `present`, `NavigationLink`, `router.push(...)`, etc.) — these are edges
- `.onAppear` / `viewDidAppear` / `useEffect` / `initState` — where appearance logs go
- Primary action handlers — where tap logs go

### 1.3 Determine feature groupings

Group screens by directory structure, naming conventions, or functional area.

### 1.4 Write the graph

Create `.tester/app-graph.yaml` (screens + metadata). For each named flow create a separate
`.tester/flows/<flow-id>.yaml` using the kebab-case flow name (`create-game.yaml`,
`edit-profile.yaml`). See **Graph Schema** below.

---

## Phase 2: Instrumentation

The same naming convention is used across platforms — `<feature>_screen`,
`<intent>_button`, `<field>_input`, `<tab>_tab` — so flows can reference one identifier set.

### 2.1 SwiftUI / UIKit (iOS, macOS, tvOS)

**Screen root identifier:**
```swift
var body: some View {
    VStack { ... }
        .accessibilityIdentifier("game_list_screen")
        .onAppear {
            print("[AppName] [Feature] GameList appeared")
        }
}
```

**Action element + tap log:**
```swift
Button("Create Game") {
    print("[AppName] [Feature] createGame tapped")
    navigator.show(screen: .createGame(group))
}
.accessibilityIdentifier("primary_action_button")
```

### 2.2 Flutter

```dart
@override
void initState() {
  super.initState();
  print('[AppName] [Feature] GameList appeared');
}

Semantics(
  label: 'primary_action_button',
  child: GestureDetector(
    onTap: () {
      print('[AppName] [Feature] createGame tapped');
      context.go('/create-game');
    },
    child: ...,
  ),
)
```

> Flutter aggregates Semantics labels into the platform accessibility tree, which is what
> `agent-device snapshot` reads. Visible text and child descriptions are also surfaced.

### 2.3 Expo / React Native

Always set **both** `testID` and `accessibilityLabel` to the same `snake_case` value so the
identifier is visible to agent-device on both iOS and Android.

```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  console.log('[AppName] [Home] HomeScreen appeared');
}, []);

return (
  <SafeAreaView testID="home_screen" accessibilityLabel="home_screen">
    <Pressable
      testID="primary_action_button"
      accessibilityLabel="primary_action_button"
      onPress={() => {
        console.log('[AppName] [Home] primaryAction tapped');
        router.push('/listing/123');
      }}
    >
      <Text>Continue</Text>
    </Pressable>
  </SafeAreaView>
);
```

### 2.4 Naming conventions

- Screens: `<feature>_screen` — e.g. `home_screen`, `login_screen`
- Buttons: `<intent>_button` — e.g. `submit_button`, `chat_now_button`
- Text inputs: `<field>_input` — e.g. `phone_input`, `otp_input`
- Tab items: `<tab>_tab` — e.g. `home_tab`, `search_tab`

### 2.5 Build to verify

**iOS:**
```bash
xcodebuild -scheme <Scheme> -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=<Device>' build
```

**macOS:**
```bash
xcodebuild -scheme <Scheme> -destination 'platform=macOS' build
```

**tvOS:**
```bash
xcodebuild -scheme <Scheme> -destination 'platform=tvOS Simulator,name=<Device>' build
```

**Flutter (Android):**
```bash
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools"
cd <flutter-project-dir>
~/fvm/versions/stable/bin/flutter run -d <device-serial> > /tmp/flutter.log 2>&1 &
# Subsequent edits: send SIGUSR1 to that flutter process for hot reload (preserves state)
# or SIGUSR2 for hot restart.
```

**Expo / React Native:**
```bash
# First-time iOS run — generates ios/, builds, launches sim
npx expo run:ios > /tmp/expo_ios.log 2>&1 &
# First-time Android run
npx expo run:android > /tmp/expo_android.log 2>&1 &
# JS-only iterations afterwards — keep Metro running:
npx expo start > /tmp/expo_metro.log 2>&1 &
# Force a full rebuild after a native dep change:
npx expo prebuild --clean && npx expo run:ios
```

---

## Phase 3: Flow Testing

A single agent-device-driven loop covers all platforms. The only platform-specific parts are
the **build / install** step (above) and any **system-alert** handling that runs in a separate
OS process (Sign in with Apple — see 3.6).

### 3.1 Load the graph

Read `.tester/app-graph.yaml` for screen data. Read flow files from `.tester/flows/` — target
by name or all files with `enabled: true`.

### 3.2 Pre-grant permissions (iOS)

agent-device drives in-app interaction; OS-level permission state is set before launch.

```bash
xcrun simctl privacy booted grant location   <bundle.id>
xcrun simctl privacy booted grant camera     <bundle.id>
xcrun simctl privacy booted grant contacts   <bundle.id>
xcrun simctl privacy booted grant photos     <bundle.id>
xcrun simctl privacy booted grant microphone <bundle.id>
# Or revoke to reset state:
xcrun simctl privacy booted revoke location  <bundle.id>
```

If a permission dialog still appears at runtime, snapshot it and tap the Allow button — see
3.6 [A].

### 3.3 Build, install, open

Build via the platform's normal toolchain (Phase 2.5), then start an agent-device session:

```bash
agent-device apps --platform <ios|macos|android>      # confirm the app is installed
agent-device open <bundle-id> --platform <ios|macos|android>
```

For first-run installs, agent-device's `install` / `install-from-source` / `reinstall` can
deploy a freshly built `.app` / `.apk` — check `agent-device help workflow` for syntax.

### 3.4 Drive each step

The default action loop, repeated per flow step:

```bash
# 1. Confirm current screen
agent-device snapshot -i                       # interactive elements with @e refs

# 2. Locate target element (any one of these)
#    - by label/text:    agent-device press --label "Create Game"
#    - by snapshot ref:  agent-device press @e3
#    - by id:            agent-device press --id primary_action_button
#    - by predicate:     agent-device find / get / is

# 3. Perform action
agent-device press --label "Create Game"
# or: fill, type, focus, scroll, long-press, back, home, rotate, app-switcher, …

# 4. Wait for transition (preferred over arbitrary sleeps)
agent-device wait <selector-or-predicate>

# 5. Confirm via app log (see "Log confirmation" below)
```

If a target only appears in the off-screen summary of a snapshot, run `agent-device scroll
<direction>` and re-snapshot until it's visible.

For exact selector syntax, predicates available to `find` / `get` / `is` / `wait`, and the
canonical action surface, run `agent-device help workflow`.

### 3.5 Log confirmation

Console logs from the app are how steps are confirmed PASSED — not screenshots. agent-device
captures them; the equivalent platform fallback works too.

| Platform | Where logs appear |
|---|---|
| iOS Swift `print()` | App stdout — capture by launching with `xcrun simctl launch --console-pty booted <bundle.id> > /tmp/app.log 2>&1 &` if running outside agent-device, or use `agent-device help debugging` for the in-session log API |
| iOS `os_log` / `Logger` | `xcrun simctl spawn booted log stream --predicate 'eventMessage CONTAINS "[AppName]"'` |
| macOS Swift `print()` | App stdout — launch the binary directly to capture |
| macOS `os_log` / `Logger` | `log stream --predicate 'eventMessage CONTAINS "[AppName]"'` |
| Flutter `print()` | `flutter run` stdout AND `adb logcat -s flutter` |
| Expo / RN `console.log` | Metro stdout, plus iOS unified log + `adb logcat -s ReactNativeJS:V` |

Then mark the step:

- **PASSED** if the expected log line appeared **or** the next screen's accessibility ID is
  visible in the next snapshot.
- **FAILED** → enter Phase 4 immediately (inline recovery). Resume the step after recovery.
  Only move on once the current step is confirmed PASSED.

### 3.6 System alerts

agent-device's snapshot surfaces dialogs that run **in-process**. Cross-process system sheets
(Sign in with Apple, the iOS account picker) are invisible to the accessibility API on the
simulator and require a different strategy.

#### Quick decision tree

```
System alert appeared?
 ├─ Permission dialog (location, camera, contacts, notifications)?
 │   → Pre-grant via simctl privacy before launch — see [A]
 │   → Or tap via agent-device if it still appears (visible in snapshot)
 ├─ ATT (App Tracking Transparency)?
 │   → Tap via agent-device — visible in snapshot — see [B]
 ├─ Sign in with Apple?
 │   → Cross-process — bypass via credential injection — see [C]
 └─ Unknown / other dialog?
     → agent-device snapshot — if visible, tap dismiss — see [D]
     → If not visible, it's cross-process — use credential injection — see [C]
```

Add recurring labels (`"Not Now"`, `"Ask App Not to Track"`, etc.) to `SYSTEM_PROMPT_DISMISS`
in `.env`, then wrap each `agent-device open` and each tap with a small dismiss sweep that
iterates the labels and calls `agent-device press --label "$label" || true`.

#### [A] Permission dialogs — pre-grant before launch (preferred)

Use `xcrun simctl privacy booted grant ...` from 3.2. Avoids the dialog entirely.

If the dialog still appears at runtime, it runs in-process and is visible to agent-device:

```bash
agent-device snapshot -i                   # locate Allow / Don't Allow buttons
agent-device press --label "Allow"
```

#### [B] ATT (App Tracking Transparency)

ATT runs **in-process** — `agent-device snapshot` sees it.

```bash
agent-device press --label "Ask App Not to Track"
```

Or add `"Ask App Not to Track"` to `SYSTEM_PROMPT_DISMISS`.

#### [C] Sign in with Apple — cross-process, use credential injection

The Apple sheet runs in `com.apple.AuthKitUIService` — a separate OS process invisible to any
accessibility-based driver including agent-device. Bypass it by injecting an email/password
session via launch arguments before normal auth runs.

**Step 1 — Create a test account (one-time)**

Use your auth backend's signup API to create a machine account
(e.g. `test-automation@yourapp.dev`). Do not use a real Apple ID or production account.

**Step 2 — Instrument the app**

```swift
// In your auth service's initialize() / setup() — before any auth state checks
#if DEBUG
if ProcessInfo.processInfo.arguments.contains("-UITestInjectSession"),
   let email = ProcessInfo.processInfo.environment["TEST_EMAIL"],
   let password = ProcessInfo.processInfo.environment["TEST_PASSWORD"] {
    do {
        // Replace with your auth backend's email+password sign-in call:
        //   Firebase:   Auth.auth().signIn(withEmail: email, password: password)
        //   Supabase:   client.auth.signIn(email: email, password: password)
        //   Custom JWT: authService.signIn(email: email, password: password)
        let result = try await yourAuthBackend.signIn(email: email, password: password)

        // ⚠️ Do NOT rely on currentUser/currentSession properties immediately after sign-in.
        // Some SDKs (e.g. Supabase Swift) do not synchronously populate them.
        // Extract the user ID from the returned result object directly:
        let userId = result.user.id
        print("[Auth] test sign-in succeeded — userId=\(userId)")

        try await setupAuthenticatedSession(userId: userId)
        return
    } catch {
        print("[Auth] test sign-in FAILED: \(error)")
    }
}
#endif
```

**Step 3 — Launch with credentials**

`SIMCTL_CHILD_` env vars are forwarded by simctl to the launched process:

```bash
SIMCTL_CHILD_TEST_EMAIL="test-automation@yourapp.dev" \
SIMCTL_CHILD_TEST_PASSWORD="YourTestPass123!" \
xcrun simctl launch --console-pty booted com.example.app \
  -UITestInjectSession
```

Then attach with `agent-device open` to drive the rest of the flow. Store credentials in
`.env`.

**Step 4 — Confirm injection worked**

Look for the success log line and check that the next snapshot shows the authenticated screen
(its `home_screen` / `<feature>_screen` ID), not the login screen.

#### [D] Unknown in-process dialog — general dismiss pattern

When an unexpected dialog blocks a step and `agent-device snapshot -i` shows it:

```bash
agent-device snapshot -i                   # find the dismiss-button label
agent-device press --label "<button label>"
```

Add the label to `SYSTEM_PROMPT_DISMISS` so the dismiss sweep handles it on subsequent runs.

> **Example — "Apple Account Verification" dialog** (simulator Apple ID re-verification):
> Text: *"Enter the password for \<email\> in Settings."* — Buttons: **Not Now**, **Settings**.
> In-process and visible to agent-device. Dismiss before interacting with Sign in with Apple,
> otherwise taps land on the dialog instead.
> `agent-device press --label "Not Now"`

### 3.7 Google Sign In on Android

The Google account picker on Android shows a native sheet that's in the same accessibility
tree as the app — `agent-device snapshot` can see it.

1. Tap the "Sign in with Google" button.
2. `agent-device wait --label "<test-account-email>"` (or just snapshot until visible).
3. `agent-device press --label "test@gmail.com"`.
4. Confirm auth success via the app log.

For fully automated flows, prefer credential injection in Dart (same shape as Apple's, via
`--dart-define`):

```dart
// In AuthService.init() — before any auth state check
if (const bool.fromEnvironment('INJECT_AUTH')) {
  final email = const String.fromEnvironment('TEST_EMAIL');
  final password = const String.fromEnvironment('TEST_PASSWORD');
  await signInWithEmailAndPassword(email, password);
  return;
}
```

Launch with:

```bash
~/fvm/versions/stable/bin/flutter run -d <serial> \
  --dart-define=INJECT_AUTH=true \
  --dart-define=TEST_EMAIL=test@example.com \
  --dart-define=TEST_PASSWORD=secret123
```

### 3.8 Close the session and report

```bash
agent-device close
```

```text
Flow: Create Game  Status: PASSED ✓
  Step 1  main → gameList       PASSED   log: [Scoreboard] [Game] GameList appeared
  Step 2  gameList → createGame PASSED   log: [Scoreboard] [Game] GameCreate appeared
```

---

## Phase 4: Inline Recovery (Step Failure)

Triggered immediately when a step fails during Phase 3. The goal is always to **recover and
continue the flow** — not just record the failure. Only mark the flow `FAILED` if recovery is
impossible.

### 4.1 Capture current state

```bash
agent-device screenshot /tmp/flow_failure_step<N>.png
agent-device snapshot --verbose > /tmp/flow_failure_step<N>.snapshot.txt
```

Read both together to understand exactly what's on screen.

> **Always write screenshots and snapshot dumps to `/tmp/`** — never to `.tester/`.
> `.tester/` is the source-of-truth graph + flow YAML directory and is git-tracked;
> ephemeral debug artifacts (screenshots, snapshots, log captures) must stay in `/tmp/`
> so they aren't committed.

### 4.2 Diagnose: app bug vs test infra issue

Classify the failure before acting — the recovery path differs.

| Symptom | Type | Likely cause | Recovery path |
|---|---|---|---|
| Element not found by ID/label | Test infra | Identifier missing or mismatched | → 4.4 |
| No log line appeared | Test infra | `print()` / `console.log` absent | → 4.4 |
| Wrong identifier in graph | Test infra | Graph out of sync with source | → 4.4 |
| Auth/login screen shown | Test infra | Missing credentials / session | Supply credentials; log in; resume |
| Tap succeeds but wrong screen appears | **App bug** | Navigation logic routes incorrectly | → 4.3 |
| Tap succeeds but no transition happens | **App bug** | Guard condition blocks nav, or handler missing | → 4.3 |
| Button not visible when it should be | **App bug** | Conditional render logic incorrect | → 4.3 |
| Crash / blank screen | **App bug** | Runtime error in source | → 4.3 |
| `agent-device open` fails or app exits immediately | **App bug** | App crashed at launch | → 4.3 |
| Same screen stays visible | Either | Button disabled by guard, OR press missed element | Check source; if guard logic wrong → 4.3; if ID wrong → 4.4 |
| Unexpected screen shown | Either | Navigation logic changed, OR graph stale | Re-read nav source; update graph if stale; if logic wrong → 4.3 |

> **Rule of thumb:** if the app ran the code but produced the wrong result, it's an app bug.
> If the test couldn't drive the app correctly (wrong ID, missing log, wrong credentials),
> it's a test infra issue.

### 4.3 App Bug Fix Loop

Loop until the step PASSES or is declared unresolvable.

#### Step A — Identify the buggy file

From the graph node's source file pointer (`swiftFile` / `dartFile` / `tsxFile`), the related
view-model, or the crash log, identify which file contains the defect.

```bash
# Recent crash or error in logs
grep -E "error|crash|fatal|Exception" /tmp/app.log | tail -20
# or read the screen source directly via Read
```

#### Step B — Fix the bug

Apply a targeted fix. Common patterns:

| Bug pattern | What to look for |
|---|---|
| Wrong screen navigated to | Navigation call has wrong route / case / params |
| Navigation never fires | Missing call in action handler, or async work not awaited |
| Button not shown | `if` / `guard` condition using wrong state variable |
| Crash on tap | Force-unwrap / null deref / index out of bounds / missing guard |
| State not updated | Observable property not mutated before navigation |

Edit the source. Keep changes minimal and targeted.

#### Step C — Rebuild and reattach

Rebuild via the platform's normal toolchain (Phase 2.5), then re-open the agent-device
session. For Flutter, prefer hot reload (SIGUSR1) over a full rebuild when state preservation
is acceptable; use hot restart (SIGUSR2) for routing/state changes.

If the build fails — read the error, fix it, and rebuild before continuing.

#### Step D — Re-navigate to the failing step

Drive from the launch screen back to the step that previously failed. Use the flow's steps
list as your guide — re-execute each prior step in order via the agent-device loop.

#### Step E — Retry the failing step

1. Confirm you're on the correct screen (snapshot ID or log).
2. Perform the action.
3. Confirm the transition (log line or snapshot ID).

**If PASSED** → continue the flow from the next step. Record the fix in the graph (4.7).

**If still FAILED** → diagnose again from Step A. The fix may have been incomplete or
revealed a second bug.

#### When to stop looping

Declare the step **unresolvable** (→ 4.8) only when:
- Root cause requires infrastructure changes outside the app code (backend down, missing
  test data that can't be created programmatically).
- The fix requires significant feature work that can't be done inline.
- Three full fix-and-retry cycles have failed with no progress.

### 4.4 Fix missing instrumentation (test infra)

Open the screen's source file from the graph node:

- Is the screen-root identifier present and matching the graph's `accessibilityId`?
- Is the appearance log in `.onAppear` / `useEffect` / `initState`?
- Is the tap log before the navigation call?
- Did the navigation call change (different screen, different transition)?

Add or correct as needed (Phase 2 patterns), then rebuild and reattach (4.3 Step C).

### 4.5 Find a way to the next step

Even if the recorded identifier can't be matched, try to reach `toScreen` another way:

1. `agent-device snapshot --verbose` — list everything currently on screen.
2. Look for the target action by visible label: `press --label "<ButtonLabel>"`.
3. If the screen layout changed, trace the new path in source and use it.
4. If an interstitial screen (login, onboarding, permission) is blocking, handle it and
   continue.

### 4.6 Retry the step

After fixing, re-attempt:
1. Confirm current screen.
2. Press / fill / scroll.
3. Confirm transition.

If PASSED → continue from the next step.

### 4.7 Update the graph with what was learned

```yaml
# .tester/app-graph.yaml — corrected node
accessibilityId: corrected_screen_id
transitions:
  - action: updated_action_name
    actionAccessibilityId: corrected_button_id
    nextScreen: actualNextScreen
    logConfirmation: "[AppName] [Feature] ActualScreen appeared"
```

Update `updatedAt` to the current ISO-8601 timestamp. If `lastResult` changes, update it in
the relevant `.tester/flows/<flow-id>.yaml`.

### 4.8 If recovery fails

- Set `lastResult: FAILED` on the flow.
- Set `failureNote` describing exactly which step failed, the root cause, and why it's
  unresolvable inline.
- Continue testing remaining flows — don't abort the full run.
- On next run, Phase 0 will flag this flow as requiring re-test after fixes.

## Graph Schema

### `.tester/app-graph.yaml` — app metadata + screens

### `.tester/flows/<flow-id>.yaml` — one file per named flow

Filename is the kebab-case flow ID (`create-game.yaml`, `edit-profile.yaml`).

```yaml
name: Human readable name
description: What this flow validates
enabled: true
lastResult: PASSED          # PASSED | FAILED | UNKNOWN
failureNote: null
steps:
  - stepId: 1
    fromScreen: gameList
    toScreen: createGame
    action: primary_action_button   # accessibilityId, or null for auto/programmatic transitions
    logConfirmation: "[AppName] [Feature] CreateGame appeared"
    prerequisites:
      - plain-English required state
```

**Field notes:**

- `platform` — `ios`, `macos`, `tvos`, or `android`; drives the build/install commands and
  any cross-process alert handling. UI driving is the same agent-device loop on all of them.
- `accessibilityId` — set in source via `.accessibilityIdentifier()` (Swift), `Semantics(label:)`
  (Flutter), or `testID` + `accessibilityLabel` (RN). Surfaced in `agent-device snapshot`.
- `swiftFile` / `dartFile` / `tsxFile` — the screen's source file.
- `action` — `null` / `auto_on_*` for programmatic transitions; otherwise the identifier or
  visible label that agent-device should target.
- `logConfirmation` — exact prefix to grep in console / Metro / logcat output.

## Phase 0: Graph Staleness Check

Run before Phase 3 every time. Determines whether to trust the existing graph or rebuild it
first.

### 0.1 Check if graph exists

If `.tester/app-graph.yaml` is missing → run Phase 1 now, then Phase 2, then Phase 3.

### 0.2 Compare navigation source against graph

Read the graph's `updatedAt` and `navSourceFiles`. For each listed file, check its
last-modified time:

```bash
git log -1 --format="%ai" -- <navSourceFile>
```

If **any** nav source file was modified after `updatedAt` → the graph is stale.

### 0.3 Stale graph — what to do

| Change severity | Action |
|---|---|
| Nav source file(s) modified | Re-run Phase 1, then Phase 2 for any new/changed screens |
| Screen file(s) modified (no nav changes) | Re-run Phase 2 for those files only; update `updatedAt` |
| Graph missing `navSourceFiles` | Treat as stale; run Phase 1 |

After Phase 1 runs, diff old screens against new:

- **New screenId** → add node + transitions; mark any flows touching it as `lastResult: UNKNOWN`.
- **Removed screenId** → remove node; mark affected flows as `lastResult: UNKNOWN` with
  `failureNote: "screen removed"`.
- **Changed transitions** → update edges; mark affected flows as `lastResult: UNKNOWN`.
- **No diff** → graph is current; proceed to Phase 3 directly.

### 0.4 Mark stale flows before testing

Any flow with `lastResult: UNKNOWN` must be re-tested. Flows still `PASSED` that touch no
changed screens can be skipped or re-run for confidence.

---

## When to Update the Graph

- Before every test run: run Phase 0 to detect nav source drift automatically.
- New screen added to navigation source → Phase 1 rebuild.
- Navigation call added, removed, or transition type changed → Phase 1 rebuild.
- Accessibility ID changed in source → update node's `accessibilityId`, re-instrument.
- Flow prerequisite changes (permission gate, auth requirement) → update `prerequisites` in
  affected steps.
- Phase 4 identifies a failure root cause → targeted edge/node fix + set
  `lastResult: FAILED`, then re-run to confirm.
