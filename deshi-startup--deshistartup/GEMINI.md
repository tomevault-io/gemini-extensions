# Deshi Startup repository guide

Read this before changing the project. For priorities and planned content, start at
[`plan/README.md`](./plan/README.md). For human contribution steps, use
[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Mission and scope

Deshi Startup is a free, open-source operating manual for founders building new, scalable
businesses in Bangladesh, published in Bangla and English. Each completed guide is available in
both languages.
Registration, tax, payments and hiring guides may also help small businesses, but the project
does not broaden its scope to become a generic SME, family-business, import/export or online-seller
portal.

English is the canonical authoring edition; the Bangla edition is translated from the finished
English guide with the `translate-bangla-guide` skill. Both editions use the same standards for
evidence, accuracy and practical usefulness. A page counts as written only when it is a real guide
without `<StubNotice />`; run `npm run backlog:status` for current counts.

## Architecture

- Next.js + Nextra render mostly static MDX content.
- Next.js exports the site to `out/`; Cloudflare Static Assets serve it without invoking the Worker.
- A small native Worker handles the contact endpoint, contribution APIs and legacy review-link redirects.
- Pagefind supplies client-side static search.
- Milkdown Crepe powers the inline editor.
- `jose` verifies Google ID tokens on every contribution request.

Key paths:

- `app/(contents)/(bn)/` – Bengali pages at clean root URLs.
- `app/(contents)/en/` – matching English pages under `/en`.
- `app/components/LocalizedLayout.tsx` – shell, navigation, page chrome and editor entry.
- `app/components/ContributionEditor.tsx` – browser editor and draft recovery.
- `worker/api/` and `worker/lib/` – contact, contribution, authentication, GitHub and media-review logic.
- `worker/index.ts` – explicit API router and static-asset fallback.
- `data/directory/` – structured directory entries.
- `data/glossary.json` – the one glossary source, read by the glossary page and every `<Term>`.
- `plan/content-backlog.csv` – canonical planned-topic and route registry.
- `app/nav.config.ts` – curated top-level navigation.
- `app/nav-groups.json` – section-hub groups.
- `app/generated/` and generated files in `public/` – build outputs; never hand-edit them.

## Routes and content trees

Content URLs have at most two semantic segments, mirrored exactly in both locales. The
`Path` column in `plan/content-backlog.csv` owns permanent planned URLs. Internal content links are
always root-relative:

- Bengali: `/registration/private-limited`
- English: `/en/registration/private-limited`

Do not derive a URL from an editable title. Do not use relative links such as `../page`.
`npm run lint:routes` enforces depth, charset, mirror parity and `<StubNotice path>`.

Section hubs use `<SectionIndex section="..." locale="..." />`; do not maintain page lists in MDX.
Add a new top-level destination to `app/nav.config.ts`, and a new section child to the appropriate
group in `app/nav-groups.json`.

## Writing a page

Before writing or editing any Bangla anywhere in the repository, including public documentation,
metadata and UI copy, read [`STYLE.md`](./STYLE.md).

Before writing content, read:

- [`EDITORIAL.md`](./EDITORIAL.md) for the quality standard: standalone pages, sources, visuals,
  and the five finish gates;
- [`plan/guide-playbook.md`](./plan/guide-playbook.md) for the English-first pipeline and the
  visual toolkit (`DataBars`, `Waterfall`, `Timeline`, `Figure`, `YouTube`, calculators);
- [`STYLE.md`](./STYLE.md) for natural Bangladeshi Bangla, used when translating; and
- the finished `/en/operations/cod-risk`, `/en/metrics/unit-economics` and
  `/en/metrics/cashflow-vs-profit` pages for working examples of the full standard.

Write the English guide first and finalise it against the five gates before translating to
Bangla.

Default guide shape:

1. frontmatter with `title` and `description`;
2. one `#` heading;
3. `> **সারকথা:**` / `> **In short:**`;
4. the decision, steps, cost/time, mistakes and checklist the topic actually needs; and
5. `## প্রাসঙ্গিক সোর্স` / `## Relevant Sources`.

Use official sources for legal, tax, fee, registration and regulatory claims. Date changeable
numbers. Never fabricate a statistic, quote, example or anecdote. Do not bump `verified:` unless
the relevant claims were re-checked against official sources.

Use GFM footnotes for inline citations: put `[^source-name]` beside the claim and define the same
identifier under the sources heading as `[^source-name]: [Source title](https://example.com)`.
Identifiers use lowercase ASCII words separated by hyphens. Numbering and backlinks are generated.

Page types with separate rules:

- Case studies use [`plan/case-study-format.md`](./plan/case-study-format.md).
- Journeys order existing guides and must not link missing routes.
- Directory pages render `data/directory/*.json`; do not hand-maintain prose tables.
- The glossary at `/start-here/glossary` renders `data/glossary.json` through `<Glossary />`;
  add or edit a term there, never as prose in the page. One entry feeds the A–Z page, the inline
  `<Term>` popover and the `#id` a guide deep-links to, so both locales stay in step by
  construction. Terms are filed alphabetically under the English headword in both editions,
  because that is the word a founder hears and looks up. `guide` is the locale-neutral route of the
  written guide that owns the concept: concepts graduate from an entry to a full guide, and the
  glossary never grows a `/glossary/{term}` tree of its own.
- Templates and scripts put the copy-ready material first.
- A stub contains `<StubNotice />` and starting sources, not guide-shaped filler.

After content changes, run `npm run manifest`, `npm run lint:bangla` and
`npm run lint:citations`. Before finishing a full guide, run `npm run build`.

## Public contribution flow

The public editor is a supported product feature:

1. A reader presses **Edit** and signs in with Google.
2. The browser sends the Google ID token as a bearer token; the server verifies it on every request.
3. `GET /api/content` resolves the URL through generated `contributable.json` and returns source MDX.
4. Crepe edits the body while locked MDX components survive as protected fenced blocks.
5. `POST /api/contribute` creates or updates a deterministic contributor/page branch and pull request
   through the GitHub App.
6. Local drafts protect unsent work; the public GitHub PR remains the review and audit record.

Contributor image upload is also supported and must retain its security boundary:

- uploads go only to the private quarantine R2 bucket;
- file type, header, size, dimensions, pixel count and quotas are checked before acceptance;
- pending media is private and bound to its owner and page;
- an allowlisted reviewer approves or rejects each image;
- approval atomically updates the article and media registry before quarantine deletion;
- unresolved pending markers fail CI; and
- abandoned quarantine objects expire after seven days.

Do not weaken these controls as a side effect of UI or refactoring work. The threat model, limits,
cost controls and recovery procedure live in
[`plan/media-operations.md`](./plan/media-operations.md).

Contribution environment variables are documented in `.env.local.example`. The GitHub App private
key is the only GitHub secret. Never expose credentials in client code.

## Media

Image bytes live in R2 and are addressed in content as `/media/...`; binaries do not belong in git.
`app/generated/media.json` is the committed registry. `app/lib/media.ts` is the only delivery-URL
resolver.

Maintainer flow:

1. stage approved PNG, JPEG or WebP files under the gitignored `media/` directory;
2. run `npm run media:upload`;
3. reference the logical `/media/...` path and commit the registry change.

Use `<Figure>` or Markdown images for images, `<YouTube>` for YouTube facades and
`<FacebookVideo>` for supported public Facebook-video facades. Browser contributors should only
need to paste a standalone video URL into an empty editor paragraph; the editor owns the component
syntax and metadata fields. Never add raw media embeds or platform iframes. Run
`npm run lint:media`. Retire and prune objects only through the dry-run-first process in
`plan/media-operations.md`.

## Generated files

`npm run manifest` derives navigation, contribution maps, SEO inputs, route date maps, sitemap,
robots, `llms.txt` and `llms-full.txt` from the content tree and git history. These are outputs, not additional
sources of truth. Do not edit or review their contents as authored files; regenerate them.

The authored media registries are the exception:

- `app/generated/media.json`
- `app/generated/media-retired.json`

`data/contributor-ledger.json` is the authored record of accepted GitHub and non-GitHub work.
`app/generated/contributors.json` is its committed schema-v3 public snapshot, reconciled against
merged pull requests by its own command, so the site never calls the GitHub API during a build or
at runtime. Refresh it with `npm run contributors:refresh` when accepted work lands; a failed
refresh leaves the previous snapshot in place. Who counts as core team, identity aliases, renames,
and opt-outs live in `data/contributors-policy.json`. Follow
`docs/contributor-recognition.md` for event boundaries, consent, roles, and correction handling.

Every guide shows that record twice: a one-line byline in the article meta row, and the full
`#credits` record below the article. Both are written into the static HTML by
`scripts/postbuild-seo.mjs` from the same events, so they cannot disagree, and neither ships
contributor data to the reader. The byline's compression and verb rules live in
`app/lib/page-byline.mjs` and are covered by `app/lib/page-byline.test.mjs`. Neither appears under
`next dev`, which runs no postbuild pass. Set `"attribution": "adaptation"` on a ledger event when
a guide is adapted from someone's published work; the byline then says so permanently, instead of
that fact living in a hand-written sentence on the page.

## Deployment and safety

Production is the `deshistartup` Cloudflare Worker at `deshistartup.com`. Workers Builds runs
`npm run build:worker` from `main`, then Wrangler deploys `out/` with the native API Worker.
Runtime variables and secrets are documented in `.env.local.example` and `wrangler.jsonc`.
Deployment architecture and size budgets are documented in
[`plan/deployment-architecture.md`](./plan/deployment-architecture.md).

`public/_headers` (copied to `out/_headers`) carries the asset response headers: the site-wide
`Strict-Transport-Security` rule, then the cache policy. Only hash-named files are marked
immutable; HTML stays revalidating so a corrected fee goes live on deploy. Add a rule there
rather than in the Worker when a new asset directory needs its own policy — static assets are
served without running Worker code, so a header set in `worker/index.ts` never reaches a page load.

The http -> https redirect is **not** in this repository. It is the zone-level "Always Use HTTPS"
setting in the Cloudflare dashboard; the Worker cannot stand in for it, for the same reason.

Pushing `main` deploys production. Never push unless Shamir asks.

Preserve these constraints:

- article critical path stays small and near-zero-JS;
- self-hosted Bengali fonts remain;
- content remains available without login;
- contribution changes always go through review;
- legal/tax content is general guidance, not professional advice;
- code is MIT and content under `app/(contents)/` is CC BY-SA 4.0.

## Agent skills

Per-repo configuration the installed engineering skills read before they act. Edit the files under
`docs/agents/` directly when a convention changes; re-running the setup skill is only needed to
switch issue trackers.

### Issue tracker

Issues and specs live as GitHub issues on `Deshi-Startup/deshistartup`, driven by the `gh` CLI.
External PRs are not treated as a triage surface. See [`docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`](./docs/agents/issue-tracker.md).

### Triage labels

The five canonical roles, each label string equal to its name: `needs-triage`, `needs-info`,
`ready-for-agent`, `ready-for-human`, `wontfix`. See [`docs/agents/triage-labels.md`](./docs/agents/triage-labels.md).

### Domain docs

Single-context: one `CONTEXT.md` plus `docs/adr/` at the repo root, both created lazily — neither
exists yet, and their absence is not a problem to flag. See [`docs/agents/domain.md`](./docs/agents/domain.md).
