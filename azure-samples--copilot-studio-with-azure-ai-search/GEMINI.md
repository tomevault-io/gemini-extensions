# Copilot Instructions

## Project Overview

This repository implements an enterprise-grade integration between Microsoft Copilot Studio and Azure AI Search using Terraform infrastructure as code and Azure Developer CLI for deployment.

## Security-first, production-ready architecture

Adopt Azure Well-Architected Framework security and reliability pillars as mandatory requirements for all code contributions. When generating or modifying code, prioritize security controls and validate implementation against these principles. Use Azure Best Practices: When generating code for Azure, running terminal commands for Azure, or performing operations related to Azure, invoke your `azure_development-get_best_practices` tool if available

**Identity and access management**
- Generate system-assigned managed identities for all Azure services (already implemented for AI Search service identity)
- Create least-privilege RBAC role assignments with specific scopes (implemented: AI Search → OpenAI, AI Search → Storage)
- Use service principal authentication for AI Search connections in production (configurable via `azure_ai_search_service_principal` variable)
- When `use_service_principal = true`, automatically disable `local_authentication_enabled` and set appropriate `authentication_failure_mode`
- Mark all sensitive Terraform variables and outputs with `sensitive = true` (implemented for client secrets)

**Network security**
- Implement private-by-default networking with VNet injection for Power Platform and deployment scripts
- Configure private endpoints for all PaaS services (implemented: AI Search, OpenAI, Storage)
- Create dedicated subnets with Network Security Groups using default-deny rules (basic NSGs implemented)
- Use Private DNS zones for proper name resolution (implemented for all private endpoints)
- Deploy NAT Gateways for controlled outbound access without public IPs

**Data protection**
- Enable encryption at rest with platform-managed keys (Azure defaults)
- Implement private endpoint networking for data plane access
- Configure diagnostic settings and audit logging for all services

**Multi-region reliability**
- Deploy primary and failover regions with paired Azure regions
- Implement cross-region private endpoint connectivity
- Use zone-redundant storage and compute SKUs where available

**Authentication and secrets**
- Use GitHub OIDC workload identity federation for Azure authentication (configured in workflows)
- Set minimal permissions on workflows: `id-token: write, contents: read`
- Support configurable GitHub runner targets via `ACTIONS_RUNNER_NAME` variable
- Never embed long-lived credentials in workflow files or environment variables

**Development environment**
- Support both local and containerized development workflows
- Pre-configure security scanning tools in dev containers
- Maintain consistent tooling versions across environments

## AZD Template Repo Structure (Terraform)

This project structure is typical for Azure Developer CLI (`azd`) templates using **Terraform** for infrastructure provisioning.

## ⚙️ AZD CLI Commands and Workflow

### Essential Commands for Development and Deployment

```bash
# Project Initialization
azd init             # Initialize project using this template (one-time setup)
azd auth login       # Authenticate with Azure (required before first deployment)

# Environment Management
azd env new          # Create a new environment (dev, staging, prod)
azd env list         # List available environments
azd env select       # Switch between environments
azd env set KEY VALUE # Set environment variables for configuration

# Complete Deployment Lifecycle
azd up               # Full deployment: provision infrastructure + deploy services
azd provision        # Deploy infrastructure only (Terraform apply)
azd deploy           # Deploy services only (without infrastructure changes)

# Infrastructure Management
azd down             # Destroy all provisioned resources (cleanup)
azd show             # Display deployed resources and their status

# CI/CD Pipeline Setup
azd pipeline config  # Configure GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments

# Development and Debugging
azd monitor          # Open monitoring dashboard for deployed resources
azd logs             # View application logs from deployed services
```

### Command Usage Scenarios

**First-time Setup:**
```bash
azd auth login                           # Authenticate to Azure
azd init --template azure-samples/...    # Initialize from template
azd env new dev                          # Create development environment
azd env set AZURE_LOCATION eastus        # Configure deployment region
azd up                                   # Complete first deployment
```

**Development Iteration:**
```bash
azd env select dev                       # Switch to development environment
azd provision                           # Apply infrastructure changes only
azd deploy                               # Deploy updated Power Platform solutions
azd monitor                              # Check deployment status and metrics
```

**Production Deployment:**
```bash
azd env new prod                         # Create production environment
azd env set AZURE_LOCATION westus2       # Set production region
azd env set AZURE_AI_SEARCH_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_CLIENT_ID "..." # Configure service principal auth
azd up                                   # Deploy to production with security hardening
```

**CI/CD Pipeline Setup:**
```bash
azd pipeline config                      # Set up GitHub Actions workflows
# Follow prompts to configure service principal and repository variables
# Creates federated identity credentials for secure, keyless authentication
```

**Cleanup and Maintenance:**
```bash
azd down --force --purge                 # Complete cleanup (use with caution)
azd show                                 # Verify resource cleanup
azd env list                             # Review remaining environments
```

### AZD Hooks Integration

This template includes comprehensive hooks that automatically execute during deployment:

- **preprovision**: Security scanning (Gitleaks, Checkov, TFLint), configuration validation
- **postprovision**: Power Platform solution deployment, AI Search configuration
- **predeploy/postdeploy**: Application-specific deployment tasks
- **prepackage/postpackage**: Artifact preparation and validation

Use `azd up` for complete deployments to ensure all hooks execute properly, or `azd provision`/`azd deploy` for targeted updates during development.
