# Breeze RMM - Codex Context

## Project Overview

Breeze is a fast, modern Remote Monitoring and Management (RMM) platform for MSPs and internal IT teams. Target: 10,000+ agents with enterprise features.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Astro + React Islands
- **API**: Hono (TypeScript)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM
- **Queue**: BullMQ + Redis
- **Agent**: Go (cross-platform)
- **Real-time**: HTTP polling + WebSocket
- **Remote Access**: WebRTC

## Key Patterns

### Multi-Tenant Hierarchy
```
Partner (MSP) → Organization (Customer) → Site (Location) → Device Group → Device
```

### Database Schema Location
- `apps/api/src/db/schema/` - All Drizzle schema definitions
- Key tables: devices, users, organizations, sites, alerts, scripts, automations

### API Routes
- `apps/api/src/routes/` - Hono route handlers
- Pattern: Export `xxxRoutes` from each file, mount in `index.ts`

### File Size Guideline
- **Aim to keep files under 500 lines** as a soft guideline, not a hard rule. Use judgment — if a file is cohesive and readable at 600 lines, that's fine. Split when a file becomes hard to navigate or mixes unrelated concerns, not just because it crossed a line count.
- **Declarative files** (e.g. `aiTools*.ts`, schema definitions) can naturally run longer since they're mostly self-contained registration blocks.
- Follow the `aiTools*.ts` pattern: one thin hub file for registry/exports, per-domain files for implementations (e.g. `aiToolsDevice.ts`, `aiToolsNetwork.ts`).
- For route files, split by resource. For service files, split by domain. Helpers used by multiple files can be duplicated locally or extracted to a shared utils file.
- **Do not proactively split files** that are working well just to meet a line count target. Only split when it improves clarity or maintainability.

### Context Preservation
- **Prefer subagents (Agent tool) for research, exploration, and isolated tasks** to keep the main conversation context lean and avoid hitting context limits during long sessions.
- Use subagents for: codebase searches, file reading/analysis, PR reviews, build log inspection, and any work that produces large output.
- Keep the main context for: decision-making, coordinating work, and user interaction.

### Shared Code
- `packages/shared/src/types/` - TypeScript interfaces
- `packages/shared/src/validators/` - Zod schemas
- `packages/shared/src/utils/` - Utility functions

## Testing Standards

### Frameworks & Configuration
- **API**: Vitest — `apps/api/vitest.config.ts` (unit), `vitest.config.rls.ts` (RLS), `vitest.integration.config.ts` (integration)
- **Web**: Vitest + jsdom — `apps/web/vitest.config.ts`
- **Agent**: Go standard `testing` package — `go test -race ./...`
- **Shared**: Vitest — `packages/shared/vitest.config.ts`
- **E2E**: Playwright Test (TypeScript), `data-testid` based — `e2e-tests/playwright.config.ts`, specs under `e2e-tests/tests/*.spec.ts`, Page Objects under `e2e-tests/pages/`. Tests query DOM via `data-testid` attributes only (not text/role/CSS) — see `e2e-tests/README.md` for the convention.

### Test File Placement
- Place test files **alongside source files**, not in separate directories
- API: `routes/devices.ts` → `routes/devices.test.ts`
- Go: `internal/discovery/scanner.go` → `internal/discovery/scanner_test.go`
- Shared: `validators/filters.ts` → `validators/filters.test.ts`

### Writing API Route Tests (Vitest)
- Mock Drizzle ORM query chains matching the exact chain pattern in the source (e.g., `select().from().where()`)
- Always test **multi-tenant isolation** — verify org-scoped data can't be accessed cross-org
- Test all HTTP methods, auth/authz, Zod validation failures, not-found, and error cases
- Use proper UUIDs in mock data — Zod validates UUID format and will reject `'other-org'`
- Avoid trailing slashes in test URLs — Hono sub-routers return 404 for trailing slashes
- `vi.mock` factories are hoisted — don't reference module-level `const` values inside them; use literal values instead
- Read 2-3 existing test files in the same directory before writing new ones to match patterns

### Writing Go Agent Tests
- Use **table-driven tests** for functions with multiple input/output combinations
- Always run with `-race` flag to catch data races
- Mock external dependencies (network, OS, filesystem) — never make real network calls
- Use build tags for platform-specific tests: `//go:build !windows` or `//go:build darwin`
- Test nil/empty inputs, error paths, and concurrency safety (spawn goroutines in tests)
- Place test helpers in the same package, not in a separate `_test` package

### Writing Shared Validator Tests
- Test valid inputs, invalid inputs, boundary values, and Zod defaults/coercion
- For discriminated unions, test each variant separately
- Test `omitempty`/optional fields with both present and absent values
- For schemas with `superRefine`, test all validation branches

### What Every New Feature Must Test
1. **Happy path** — basic success case
2. **Auth/authz** — unauthenticated, wrong role, wrong org
3. **Validation** — missing required fields, invalid types, boundary values
4. **Multi-tenant isolation** — cross-org access denied
5. **Error cases** — not found, conflict, server error
6. **Edge cases** — empty arrays, nil inputs, concurrent access

### CI Integration
- All tests run automatically in CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
- `test-api`, `test-web`, `test-agent` are **required** jobs on PRs
- New test files are auto-discovered — no CI config changes needed
- Go coverage is uploaded as artifact; no threshold enforced yet
- Integration tests run in `smoke-test` job with `continue-on-error: true`

### Running Tests Locally
```bash
# All tests
pnpm test

# API only
pnpm test --filter=@breeze/api

# Go agent (with race detection)
cd agent && go test -race ./...

# Specific Go package
cd agent && go test -race ./internal/discovery/...

# E2E
cd e2e-tests && pnpm test
```

## Codex Delegation

This project uses OpenAI Codex CLI for task delegation. Codex orchestrates complex work while Codex handles isolated tasks.

### Quick Commands

```bash
# Standard task
codex exec "<task>" --full-auto -C "/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze"

# With reasoning level (low/medium/high/xhigh)
codex exec "<task>" --full-auto -c 'model_reasoning_effort="xhigh"'

# Resume previous session
codex exec resume --last "<follow-up>"
```

### Delegation Guidelines

#### Delegate to Codex
| Task | Reasoning | Example |
|------|-----------|---------|
| File operations | low | "Find all files importing X" |
| Utility functions | medium | "Create a slugify utility" |
| CRUD endpoints | medium | "Add DELETE /api/devices/:id" |
| Test generation | medium | "Write tests for formatBytes" |
| Lint/type fixes | medium | "Fix TypeScript errors in auth.ts" |
| Code analysis | high | "Review this for security issues" |
| Architecture | xhigh | "Design the caching strategy" |

#### Keep with Codex
- Multi-tenant data isolation
- Authentication/authorization logic
- Cross-module refactoring
- Business logic implementation
- Coordinating multiple Codex tasks
- Final code review and integration

### Reasoning Effort Findings

| Level | Behavior | Use When |
|-------|----------|----------|
| `low` | Verbose, more tokens | Simple mechanical tasks |
| `medium` | Balanced (default) | Standard code generation |
| `high` | Thoughtful analysis | Code review, debugging |
| `xhigh` | Strategic, concise, fewer tokens | Architecture decisions |

### Token Costs (Tested)

| Task Type | Approximate Tokens |
|-----------|-------------------|
| File search | ~1.3k |
| Code comprehension | ~2.9k |
| Utility generation | ~3.5k |
| Security analysis | ~2.4-4.7k |
| Architecture design | ~1.6-4.7k |

### Codex Strengths (Observed)

- Uses `rg` efficiently for searches
- Proactively creates directories and updates exports
- Follows existing project conventions
- Good at isolated, well-scoped tasks
- Excellent security analysis capabilities

## Development Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start development servers
pnpm dev

# Database operations
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://breeze:breeze@localhost:5432/breeze"
pnpm db:check-drift  # Verify schema matches migrations (no drift)
pnpm db:studio       # Open Drizzle Studio

# Agent development
cd agent && make run
```

### Schema Migration Workflow
1. Edit schema files in `apps/api/src/db/schema/`
2. Write a hand-written SQL migration in `apps/api/migrations/NNNN-<slug>.sql`
   - Use the next available 4-digit number (check existing files)
   - Must be fully idempotent: `IF NOT EXISTS`, `IF EXISTS`, `DO $$ BEGIN ... EXCEPTION`
   - Never edit a shipped migration — fix forward with a new migration
3. Run `pnpm db:check-drift` to verify schema matches migrations
4. Commit the migration file

**Drizzle usage:** Drizzle ORM is used for type-safe queries only. `drizzle-kit` is retained for schema drift detection (`db:check-drift`) and Drizzle Studio (`db:studio`). **Do not use `drizzle-kit generate` or `drizzle-kit push` for migrations.**

For optional TimescaleDB setup, see `apps/api/migrations/optional/`.

### Docker Compose Modes

Three named override files exist — no auto-applied `docker-compose.override.yml` by default.

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `docker-compose.override.yml.dev` | Code-mounted hot-reload (builds from `Dockerfile.api.dev` / `Dockerfile.web.dev`) |
| `docker-compose.override.yml.ghcr` | Pre-built GHCR images (linux/amd64) |
| `docker-compose.override.yml.local-build` | Native arm64 local build from production Dockerfiles |

```bash
# Dev mode (code-mounted, hot-reload)
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.override.yml.dev up --build -d

# GHCR mode (pre-built images)
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.override.yml.ghcr up -d

# Local build mode (native arm64)
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.override.yml.local-build up --build -d

# Or symlink whichever mode you want as default:
ln -sf docker-compose.override.yml.dev docker-compose.override.yml
docker compose up --build -d
```

### PR Merge Process
- Branch protection requires status checks, but the repo owner uses `--admin` to bypass when CI is green
- Use `gh pr merge --squash --admin` (merge commits are disabled on this repo)
- This is the normal workflow — do not wait for branch protection rules to be satisfied

## Current Status

See `docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md` for implementation status and next steps.

### Priority: Authentication System
- Login/logout with JWT
- MFA (TOTP)
- Password reset flow
- SSO integration
- Rate limiting (Redis-backed sliding window)
