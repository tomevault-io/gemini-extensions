## Project Overview

Snapshot-fork sandboxes for AI agents on Kubernetes. The system boots Firecracker microVMs, forks them via copy-on-write snapshots, and exposes the whole lifecycle through declarative CRDs (SandboxPool, Sandbox, Workspace) in API group `mitos.run/v1`.

Components:

- **controller** (Deployment): reconciles the CRDs, selects nodes, drives forkd.
- **forkd** (DaemonSet): per-node fork daemon; gRPC on :9090 for the controller, HTTP sandbox API on :9091 for exec and file traffic.
- **guest agent** (PID 1 in the VM): speaks the vsock protocol for exec, files, env, and fork notifications.
- **sandbox-server** (standalone): the same engine behind a plain REST API, no Kubernetes required.
- **Python SDK** (`sdk/python`): client for both k8s mode and sandbox-server mode.

ROADMAP.md is the priority order for all work. docs/api/v2-spec.md is the target API.

## Operating Principles

These outrank convenience:

1. **No unverified claims.** Every public number must be reproducible from `bench/` or it does not get written.
2. **Security findings block features.** The threat model (docs/threat-model.md) must be updated in the same PR whenever the security surface moves.
3. **Honest Kubernetes semantics.** Sandboxes are not pods; never imply pod-scoped mechanisms (NetworkPolicy, ResourceQuota, PSA) govern them.
4. **Boring failure behavior.** Every component defines what happens on crash, node loss, slow etcd, and capacity exhaustion.
5. **Bare metal is a first-class target.**
6. **Experience is DNA.** Every user-facing surface follows the journey rules:
   no dead ends, simple surface with depth one click down, intent-shaped aha.
   See docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-27-hosted-launch-journey-design.md.
7. **Self-host is first-class (Apache-2.0).** mitos is open source and people run
   it themselves; the self-hosted experience is a peer of the hosted one, never an
   afterthought to the SaaS. One console image and SPA serve both, differing ONLY
   by the capabilities document (`GET /console/capabilities`); never fork an
   edition build. Every hosted-only surface (self-serve signup, billing, credits
   and top-up, the allowlist gate, Paddle, abuse email checks) MUST be
   capability-gated so a self-hoster gets a clean, complete product: no dead links,
   no empty billing panels, no "add credits" or signup prompts. The journey rules
   apply to the community first-run too; it points at the SDK/CLI and a real first
   success, never at a paywall.

## Commands

```bash
make build                # controller + forkd binaries
make test-unit            # fork, workspace, vsock unit tests
make test-controller      # envtest suite (needs setup-envtest)
make test-python          # Python SDK tests
make proto                # regenerate gRPC stubs from proto/forkd.proto
make generate manifests   # regenerate deepcopy + CRD YAML after api/ changes
```

- Direct controller tests: `eval $(~/go/bin/setup-envtest use 1.31 -p env) && go test ./internal/controller/`
- Python tests directly: `cd sdk/python && PYTHONPATH=. python3 -m pytest tests/`
- Lint, BOTH invocations are required: `golangci-lint run --timeout=5m` AND `GOOS=linux golangci-lint run --timeout=5m`. Some packages are linux-only and invisible to the darwin run.

## Architecture

- **controller** (`cmd/controller`, `internal/controller`): reconciles SandboxPool, Sandbox, Workspace, WorkspaceRevision; tracks forkd nodes via the NodeRegistry fed by capacity heartbeats.
- **forkd** (`cmd/forkd`, `internal/daemon`): node daemon that owns VMs; gRPC service on :9090 (fork, prepare-pool, heartbeat), HTTP sandbox API on :9091 (exec, files, status).
- **fork engines** (`internal/fork`): the real engine (internal/fork/engine.go) drives Firecracker snapshot/restore and needs KVM; the mock engine (internal/fork/mock.go, KVMAvailable=false) is used by kind e2e and envtest.
- **firecracker client** (`internal/firecracker`): VM lifecycle over the Firecracker API socket.
- **guest agent** (`guest/agent-rs`): PID 1 inside the VM; serves gRPC on vsock port 53 (`internal/vsock` and `internal/guestgrpc` are the host side). The legacy JSON protocol and Go agent are removed (#310).
- **sandbox-server** (`cmd/sandbox-server`): standalone REST API on the same engine, no k8s.
- **Python SDK** (`sdk/python/mitos`): talks to forkd or sandbox-server.

Data paths:

- **Claim path**: controller selects a node from the NodeRegistry, calls forkd `Fork` over gRPC; the claim status endpoint is forkd's HTTP API on that node.
- **Exec path**: SDK -> forkd :9091 -> vsock -> guest agent.

## Coding Conventions

### Punctuation (strict)

Never use em (U+2014) or en (U+2013) dashes anywhere: source, comments, docstrings, Markdown, YAML, CRD descriptions, commit messages, PR descriptions, the GitHub repo description, and release notes. Use only `.` `,` `;` `:` as punctuation connectors. ASCII hyphen-minus (-) is fine for ranges and compound identifiers. If a third-party tool inserts one (release-please, Dependabot), rewrite it before merging.

### Go style

- Error wrapping: `fmt.Errorf("context: %w", err)`.
- Octal literals as `0o644`.
- gofmt and golangci-lint clean is a merge requirement.
- Test files are excluded from errcheck via .golangci.yml; production code is not.

### Secrets

Secret VALUES are never logged, never in error messages, never in condition messages, never written to host paths. Log keys and counts only. Runtime errors should carry actionable remediation text (the API v2 LLM-legible error rule, issue #28).

### Commits and branches

- Conventional commits: feat, fix, docs, ci, chore, refactor, test.
- Branch naming: feat/, fix/, chore/, docs/, ci/, refactor/.
- DCO: every commit MUST carry a `Signed-off-by: Name <email>` trailer (use `git commit -s`). The `dco-check` CI job fails the PR if any non-merge commit lacks one, so add it as you commit rather than rewriting history later.

### TDD

Write the failing test first. Every behavior change lands with its test in the same commit.

### git

- Stage explicit paths only; never `git add -A`.
- README claims follow the no-unverified-claims rule: every number it states must be reproducible from `bench/` or carry an explicit issue reference marking it as a target.

## CI Pipeline

Jobs:

- **go-test**: build, vet, full test suite; envtest assets installed in-job.
- **go-lint**: golangci-lint.
- **python-test**: SDK pytest.
- **docker-build**: controller and forkd images.
- **kind-e2e**: mock engine on kind (config hack/kind-config.yaml).
- **kind-e2e-husk**: husk-pod warm-pool e2e on kind (transient nested-KVM steps retry; the warm.min reconcile and placement gates hard-fail).
- **kind-e2e-placement**: placement-confinement e2e on kind.
- **firecracker-test** (kvm-test.yaml): real Firecracker snapshot/restore plus guest agent exec over vsock on KVM runners.

All eight are required checks on main; main requires branches to be up to date.

### PR lifecycle (mandatory, every PR)

Opening a PR is not the end of the job; the PR is yours until it merges:

1. **Conform to the template and policy before pushing.** The pr-policy workflow enforces a conventional-commit title (types: feat, fix, docs, ci, chore, refactor, test; no other types), all required body sections from `.github/pull_request_template.md` (the pr-policy workflow hard-fails on missing `## Thinking Path`, `## Verification`, or `## Model Used` with real content; fill the rest of the template honestly too), no em or en dashes in added lines, and no internal references. Write the PR to pass these on the first run, not after a red check.
2. **Drive CI green yourself.** Watch the checks after every push; investigate and fix every failure. Never leave a PR red, never ask a human to shepherd a check you can fix, and never merge with a failing or skipped required check. Flaky reruns are a last resort after reading the failure, not a first response.
3. **Resolve ALL CodeRabbit feedback.** Triage every CodeRabbit comment like a human review finding: fix what is right, and reply with a concrete technical rebuttal where it is wrong; never ignore or blanket-dismiss. The PR is not mergeable while CodeRabbit comments sit unaddressed.

The self-hosted real-KVM-cluster workflow (cluster-e2e.yaml, push / `ci-cluster`-labeled-PR triggered, not one of the eight required checks) carries the predicate-level e2e suites: `cluster-husk-e2e`, `cluster-workspace-e2e`, `cluster-husk-network-e2e`, and `cluster-facade-conformance-e2e` (the agents.x-k8s.io facade Ready predicate on a real booted VMM, issue #357). The object-level `facade-conformance` kind job in ci.yaml proves the facade bridge object-level on kind.

## Security Practices

- The forkd threat surface is documented in docs/threat-model.md with per-row status; keep it current in the same PR as any surface change.
- Fork-correctness hazards (RNG, clocks, secret inheritance) live in docs/fork-correctness.md.
- Security-sensitive paths require extra care and a named human reviewer before merge: `internal/fork`, `internal/firecracker`, `internal/daemon`, `guest/agent-rs`, and future token/attenuation code.
- Sequencing gates: the fork-correctness suite and failure/GC semantics must be green in CI before any integration workstream ships to production tenants.

## Workflow Pointers

- ROADMAP.md is the priority order; GitHub issues #2-#37 map it.
- Plans live in docs/superpowers/plans/.
- Every PR needs: tests, docs updated in the same PR, a threat-model delta if the security surface moved, and a benchmark run if the hot path was touched.
