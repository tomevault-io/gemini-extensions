# The plugin contract

What a plugin may do, what the host promises it, and the rules that make an in-process plugin safe to
run. [`README.md`](README.md) beside this is the contract itself — capabilities, config fields,
manifests, versioning — and is required reading before touching `plugins/` or this package. This
file is the part that is easy to break by accident.

Every paragraph here records a measured failure and the fix that was chosen over the obvious one.
Read the ones covering whatever you are about to change. The always-loaded index is
[`CLAUDE.md`](../../CLAUDE.md).

## The boundary

**The JSON-safe rule now covers what is stored or sent, and nothing else.** Manifests, permissions, config fields and every `capabilities/` payload: no `Date`, no class instances, no functions, durations as integer milliseconds, dates as ISO-8601 strings. The reason is Postgres and the console's JSON, not a wire format, and it survives on that basis alone. Host methods are exempt and deliberately so: `host.fetch` returns a real `Response`, `host.signal` a real `AbortSignal`, `speak()` a real `ReadableStream`. `boundary.json.safe.ts` fails `tsc` over a registered payload and its registry-coverage test fails over a boundary interface classified in none of its three arrays, so neither can drift by accident.

**In plugin code, `undefined` means "not set". Never `null`.**

**An installed plugin reaches the host's SDK through a link the host makes, not through its own
`node_modules`.** A plugin under `PLUGINS_DIR` cannot walk up to the station's tree, so the host links its
copies of this package and of every non-optional peer into `<PLUGINS_DIR>/node_modules` before each
discovery (`apps/api/src/modules/plugins/plugin.peers.ts`; the reasoning is in `apps/api/CLAUDE.md` under
"Plugins, from the host side"). So a new REQUIRED peer here is a new link there with no other change, and an
optional one is not linked at all, which is why `vitest` is optional. A plugin that ships its own copy in a
`node_modules` beside it gets that copy instead, and the brand on `PluginError` and the duck-typed zod check
are what keep that working rather than what it is designed around.

## Trust and egress

**Plugins are trusted code, permanently.** They load through a plain dynamic `import()` into the host realm and can reach `process.env`, `fs`, and the pg pool. `host.fetch` protects an honest plugin from a hostile upstream and protects the operator from a careless plugin. It does not contain a hostile one, and no future version will: the subprocess option is closed, not deferred. Do not write docs, UI copy, or comments claiming otherwise, and do not reintroduce a constraint whose only justification is a move that is not happening.

**What the layer is FOR, and what it is not.** Four threats were tabled when this was decided and three are answered. A hostile UPSTREAM against an honest plugin: the response timeout, the three body bounds, the per-hop redirect re-check and the breaker. A CARELESS plugin against the operator: the per-upstream rate bucket, the allowlist, and the private-address refusal on anything reached through `network.open`. And a plugin's MISTAKE leaking into the host, which is why art URLs are `http(s)` only and why `scrubProcessEnv` deletes the secrets from `process.env` once the config snapshot has been taken — both hygiene against an accident, neither of them containment. The fourth, a HOSTILE plugin, is not answered and never will be; the enable dialog says so in plain words, and a manifest is a description of a well-behaved plugin's blast radius rather than a limit on a badly-behaved one. Keep that distinction in any copy you write: claiming the manifest constrains a plugin is the specific false sentence this section exists to prevent.

**Closing the subprocess option is what bought back a live object across the boundary.** While isolation was still on the table nothing could cross it but JSON, so audio came back as the `host.streams` protocol — opaque handles, sequence numbers, base64 chunks and an idempotent `close()` — with a drain loop in `SpeechService` reassembling it. All of that is deleted: `speak()` returns a `ReadableStream` and `host.fetch` a real `Response`. What survives of the protocol is only its BOUNDS, and they survive because they were never about isolation: a body is read outside the call that fetched it, so it needs its own idle, lifetime and size limits whoever is holding it.

**`host.socket` is the second egress, and it answers to the same policy.** Slack's Socket Mode and the Discord Gateway deliver button presses and slash commands over a WebSocket the client holds, and a plugin has no inbound HTTP to take them any other way. So `host.socket` opens a `wss:` socket whose host must pass `assertAllowed` (as the `https:` URL it upgrades from, so one allowlist governs both) and `assertPublicAddress` when reached through `network.open`, and whose connect spends a rate-bucket token. What it cannot share with fetch is the deadline: a socket exists to outlive the call that opened it. It is bounded instead by `PLUGIN_SOCKET_MAX_FRAME_BYTES`, `PLUGIN_SOCKET_MAX_OPEN`, a connect timeout, and `PluginHostFactory.closeOpenSockets` on dispose, which also refuses any later socket through that host so a client nobody stopped cannot reconnect for a plugin that is gone. It answers the same two threats fetch does and no third one: the rebinding gap below is as open for a socket as for a fetch. Gated by the `sockets` manifest flag, a disclosure like `trackFetcher`, because the hosts it may reach are already the ones `network` lists.

**`host.fetch` returns a real `Response`, and it is the only egress for HTTP.** `response.body` is how bytes stream; there is no second path and the old `host.streams` protocol is gone. `timeoutMs` bounds getting the response (connect, headers, the whole redirect chain) and stops there, because a large body legitimately outlives the call that fetched it: reading it is bounded separately by `PLUGIN_BODY_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS`, `PLUGIN_BODY_LIFETIME_MS` and `PLUGIN_RESPONSE_MAX_BYTES`, enforced by one guard wrapping every body. `url` and `redirected` are set by the host, because redirects are followed by hand to re-check the allowlist per hop and a constructed `Response` has neither. `jsonBody` / `tryJsonBody` are `async` free functions that keep the response the platform's own. A body nobody will read should be `cancel()`ed; `PluginHostFactory.cancelOpenBodies` is the backstop on dispose, not the plan.

**A host reached through the `network.open` grant is RESOLVED before it is connected to, and refused if any address it answers with is private; a host the manifest named, or the operator supplied through `fromConfig`, is not.** `isPrivateAddress` reads the name and is the right test for a literal and no test at all for a hostname: a public name in a feed item or a search result is whatever its owner points it at, and for as long as only the name was read the host connected to `127.0.0.1` behind one. `privateAddressBehind` in `plugin.grants.ts` is the other half, injected into `PluginHostFactoryOptions` so tests resolve wherever they say. The API's own fetches of a URL that arrived as DATA apply the same rule per hop, redirects followed by hand: `PodcastFetchService` for an enclosure, and `ArtCacheService` for an art URL, where the operator's exception is `PluginOperatorHosts` (the servers an ENABLED plugin's `fromConfig` settings name), matched by host AND port because an art URL naming a Navidrome's machine vouches for the Navidrome and not for whatever else listens there. What it does not close is rebinding between that lookup and the connection's own, which needs the fetch pinned to the checked address and is not built.

**`host.fetch` policy is per upstream, and its budget is the live one.** `permissions.network` entries are bare hostnames, or objects carrying `ratePerSecond` and a shared `bucket` (a published limit usually covers a service, not a hostname), or `{ fromConfig: 'baseUrl' }` for an address the operator supplies. The fetch budget is capped by whatever the _current invocation_ has left, published by `PluginInvoker` through `plugin.invocation.deadline.ts` and readable by plugins as `host.remainingMs()` (sync) or watched as `host.signal`, not by the `PLUGIN_INVOKE_TIMEOUT_MS` constant. `host.signal` is the invoker's own `AbortController` signal rather than a copy, so honouring it and being abandoned are the same moment. Everything the host throws at plugin code is a `PluginError`, never a `ServerkitError`: the invoker's `toPluginError` flattens anything else to `internal`, and the status the host chose never reaches the client.

## Writing one

**Never read `this.host` after an `await`. Capture it once, before the first one.** `dispose()` releases the host, and an operator saving a plugin's config reinitializes it — so a request that was in flight when they pressed Save comes back to an instance whose `host` getter now throws. Measured on `plugins/websearch`: the catch handler around a failed search reached for `this.host.logger` and threw `used before init() or after dispose()`, which turned a search that had simply failed into an INVOKER failure, and three of those quarantine the plugin. A config save during a background walk could therefore take a working plugin off the station. The fix is one line and it is the pattern every helper in the SDK already follows — `fetchArticle`, `fetchFeed` and the rest all TAKE a host rather than reaching for one: `const host = this.host` at the top, then use `host` throughout. The request in flight is still allowed to finish and be reported; what must not survive the await is the reference.

**A plugin extends `Plugin` and registers its own teardown.** `packages/plugin-sdk/src/plugin.base.ts`: `this.host` is a getter that throws a sentence naming the plugin rather than a `TypeError`, and `register(disposer)` puts an undo beside its setup, run last-registered-first on unload even when one throws. This matters more in-process, not less, because a timer a plugin forgets lives in the API server until a restart and an operator reloads plugins on every config change. Extending it is optional; the host only ever asks for `PluginLifecycle`. Note `host` being a getter costs TypeScript's narrowing of other properties across a read of it.

**A speech plugin's delivery is a word it translates, never a number it is handed.** `SpeechRequest.delivery`
(`hushed`, `frantic`) is the one thing about a READING the host carries, and it is on the request for the same
reason a cue is in the text: the station asks in its own vocabulary and each engine translates. The obvious
shape was an `exaggeration` field, which is one engine family's scale on the contract, and it would have tied
every script the station writes to the engine it was written for. The numbers stay in each plugin's voice map.
`listDeliveries` is `listCues`' twin and carries its one failure mode: claiming a delivery the loaded engine
cannot perform is the only way to break it, because the host drops everything unclaimed and the writer is
offered only what was claimed. See README § "Cues and deliveries".

## Config fields

**A list an operator adds to is a `list` config field, not a box with a separator in it.**
`ConfigFieldType` covers `list` with declared `columns` (`packages/plugin-sdk/src/plugin.config.fields.ts`),
stored as a JSON array of row objects in a string exactly as a `multiselect` stores its values, read
back with `parseRows`, and drawn by the console's one settings form as a table with an Add button.
It exists because `id|Name|address` lines are what a list becomes the moment its entries have parts,
and a mistyped line is a feed the station silently does not have — the same argument that moved the
format clock out of a settings box. Three things are load-bearing. A cell is named POSITIONALLY
inside the form (`f3.0.c1`, `cellNameOf`) and the column's own key is put back on the way out, which
is `nameOf`'s rule one level down: a cell is addressed by path, a dot in a path is a step into a
nested object, and translating dots to dashes would quietly merge a plugin's `a.b` and `a-b` into
one cell. So a column key is shaped however the plugin likes, dots included, and nothing about this
reaches a plugin author. The HOST's allowlist reads a `fromConfig` list through the columns declared
`url` and no others (`addressCells` in `plugin.host.factory.ts`), because `hostnameFromSetting`
accepts a bare hostname and would otherwise put a category called `sport` on the allowlist. And a
field or column may declare `optionsFrom`, a closed host vocabulary resolved by the CONSOLE — the
third way a form learns what to offer, and the one a plugin usually cannot answer for itself, since a
news plugin has no way to learn which categories this station holds. The property is about who can
ANSWER rather than about where the answer is kept, which is why the platform's zone list sits there
beside the station's own tables: a zone name has to be one the operator's browser knows, and a server
enumerating its own would be answering for a different machine. Eleven members today: the station's
own tables (`station.newsCategories`, `station.newsFeeds`, `station.podcastShows`,
`station.narrationSeries`), the platform's zones (`intl.timeZones`), the enabled plugins declaring a
capability (`plugins.speech`, `plugins.llm`, `plugins.mixer`, `plugins.analysis`,
`plugins.similarity`), and `llm.models`. The five `plugins.*` are the only ones with no user left:
the settings that named a plugin moved to the Providers section, which is fed by
`GET /plugins/providers` rather than by a list of candidates, because the candidates were never the
hard part — what the station DOES with them was. They stay declared because removing a member is an
SDK type change and a plugin may yet want one.

**`llm.models` is the one that breaks the sentence above, and it is worth knowing why it is still
here.** Its answer comes FROM a plugin: the console asks whichever plugin the station reaches for
words — `GET /plugins/providers`, not a rule the console works out itself — for its `model`
suggestions, through the same route that plugin's own settings form uses. It qualifies as
a host vocabulary anyway on the property that actually matters — a plugin cannot answer it *for
itself*, because the question is "what can this STATION'S model plugin offer" and no plugin knows
which one that is or whether it is the one selected. The station settings that use it are the
per-writer model keys, and what makes them worth filling from the plugin rather than typing is that a
model name now carries which provider it lives on.

**A CELL's choices can also come from the plugin, which is the second of those three ways reaching one column
rather than one field.** `suggestConfigOptions()` publishes under `columnSuggestionKey(fieldKey, columnKey)` —
`voices.engine`, a dot-joined pair that cannot collide with a field key because a column key may not contain
one — and the form merges it exactly where it merges a resolved `optionsFrom`. Both speech plugins fill their
engine-voice column this way, which is the difference between a table an operator can complete and one that
requires knowing `af_heart` by heart.

**A cell with choices renders as an AUTOCOMPLETE and not a select**, deliberately: the server's list is what
it currently holds rather than the whole vocabulary, so a Kokoro blend expression and a Chatterbox clip added
since the last refresh both have to stay typeable. Being unable to name a voice the server HAS is a worse
failure than naming one it does not.
