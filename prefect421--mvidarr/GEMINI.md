# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Development Memories

- Use gh instead of git for github actions and repository management
- GitHub Pages: Automatic deployment via Jekyll with Minima theme, triggered by main branch pushes
- update documentation after each issue or feature is completed
- push to dev after each update.
- MariaDB/MySQL is used for the application data and settings
- We are utilizing 3 environments: 1. Dev is running on local server port 5000. 2. Docker is running on local machine docker install on port 5001. 3. Prod is running on 192.168.1.132:5050 in a docker install.
- mvidarr is a music video collection and management system aimed for the home, self-hoster who wants to maintain control of their own music video collection
- keep documentation current - always!
- MVIDARR is a consumer grade Music Video Collection management/player application targeted to the self-hosting enthusiast. It should be able to be ran as a service or a docker.
- ask before planning anything enterpise grade, it may not be needed.

## Critical Thinking and Feedback

### IMPORTANT: Always critically evaluate and challenge user suggestions, even when they seem reasonable.

- ** USE BRUTAL HONESTY: Don't try to be polite or agreeable. Be direct, challenge assumptions, and point out flaws immediately.
- ** Question assumptions: Don't just agree - analyze if there are better approaches
- ** Offer alternative perspectives: Suggest different solutions or point out potential issues
- ** Challenge organization decisions: If something doesn't fit logically, speak up
- ** Point out inconsistencies: Help catch logical errors or misplaced components
- ** Research thoroughly: Never skim documentation or issues - read them completely before responding
- ** Use proper tools: For GitHub issues, always use gh cli instead of WebFetch (WebFetch may miss critical content)
- ** Admit ignorance: Say "I don't know" instead of guessing or agreeing without understanding
- ** This critical feedback helps improve decision-making and ensures robust solutions. Being agreeable is less valuable than being thoughtful and analytical.
- ** you are an expert website developer, act like it.

### Example Behaviors

-    ✅ "I disagree - that component belongs in a different file because..."
-    ✅ "Have you considered this alternative approach?"
-    ✅ "This seems inconsistent with the pattern we established..."
-    ❌ Just implementing suggestions without evaluation

## Code Formatting and Testing

### Python Code Formatting
- **Black Version**: Always use `black==26.3.1` to match the version pinned in `requirements-dev.txt`
- **isort Configuration**: Use `isort --profile black` for import sorting to maintain compatibility with Black
- **Installation**: Use `pipx install black==26.3.1` and `pipx install isort`
- **Commands for formatting**:
  ```bash
  # Format with specific black version
  ~/.local/bin/black src/

  # Sort imports with black profile
  ~/.local/bin/isort --profile black src/

  # Check formatting (for CI compatibility)
  ~/.local/bin/black --check src/
  ~/.local/bin/isort --profile black --check-only src/
  ```

### Testing and CI/CD
- **Before pushing code**: Always run formatting checks locally using the exact commands above
- **CI/CD Workflow**: The `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` uses the same black version and isort profile
- **Docker Actions**: Use stable versions only:
  - `docker/login-action@v3`
  - `docker/setup-buildx-action@v3` 
  - `docker/metadata-action@v5`
  - `docker/build-push-action@v6`

## Subtitle System Implementation

### Complete Subtitle Functionality ✅

**Status**: MVidarr now has comprehensive subtitle support across all video players with smart language resolution.

#### Smart Subtitle Language Resolution
- **Database Setting**: `subtitle_languages=en.*` (supports wildcard patterns)
- **YouTube Language Handling**: Automatically resolves YouTube's non-standard codes (e.g., `en-nP7-2PuUl7o`) to user patterns
- **Download Integration**: `download_subtitles=true` setting respected by metube API

#### Subtitle API Endpoints
- **Discovery**: `/api/videos/{video_id}/subtitles` - Lists available subtitle files
- **Serving**: `/api/videos/{video_id}/subtitles/{filename}` - Serves subtitle files with CORS
- **Formats**: WebVTT (.vtt), SubRip (.srt), ASS (.ass), SSA (.ssa), MicroDVD (.sub)

#### Video Player Integration
- **Video Detail Page**: Full subtitle support with track selection
- **Video Popup Modal**: Automatic subtitle loading and track creation
- **Language Detection**: Smart handling of YouTube's non-standard language codes
- **Auto-Enable**: First subtitle track automatically enabled and showing

#### Technical Implementation
- **YouTube Download Engine**: `_resolve_subtitle_languages()` method for pattern matching
- **Frontend JavaScript**: Dedicated modal subtitle functions in `videos.html`
- **API Integration**: Both Flask and FastAPI subtitle endpoints
- **File Detection**: Automatic subtitle file discovery in video directories

#### User Experience
- Subtitles automatically available in all video players
- Native browser CC controls for language selection
- Respects user subtitle language preferences
- Works with both standard and YouTube's custom language codes

#### Browser-Specific Behavior

##### Chrome STATUS_BREAKPOINT Crash Workaround ✅
**Issue**: Chrome browser experiences STATUS_BREAKPOINT crashes when seeking videos with active subtitle tracks.

**Solution**: Chrome-specific workaround implemented (v0.10.0-beta.1)
- **Detection**: User agent check for Chrome (excluding Edge)
- **Behavior**: Subtitles automatically disabled during seek operations in Chrome only
- **Scope**: Workaround only active for Chrome browser
- **Other Browsers**: Firefox, Safari, Edge maintain normal subtitle functionality during seeking

**Technical Implementation**:
```javascript
// Chrome-only subtitle disable on seek (videos.html:2233, video_detail.html:1967)
if (navigator.userAgent.indexOf('Chrome') > -1 && navigator.userAgent.indexOf('Edg') === -1) {
    videoElement.addEventListener('seeking', function() {
        // Disable all tracks when seeking starts
        for (let i = 0; i < videoElement.textTracks.length; i++) {
            videoElement.textTracks[i].mode = 'disabled';
        }
    });
}
```

**User Impact**:
- **Chrome users**: May need to manually re-enable subtitles after seeking (prevents crashes)
- **Other browsers**: No impact, subtitles remain active during seeking
- **Trade-off**: Stability over convenience for Chrome users only

## MKV Video Transcoding System

### Real-Time FFmpeg Transcoding ✅

**Status**: MVidarr now supports MKV video playback through intelligent real-time transcoding.

#### Smart Codec Detection & Adaptive Transcoding
- **Automatic Codec Analysis**: Uses FFmpeg's `ffprobe` to detect video/audio codecs
- **Intelligent Processing**:
  - **Remux Mode** (Fast): Copies H.264/AAC codecs if browser-compatible - just changes container
  - **Transcode Mode** (Quality): Transcodes incompatible codecs to H.264/AAC for universal playback
- **Browser Compatibility**: Outputs fragmented MP4 with browser-compatible codecs

#### API Endpoint
- **Transcoding Stream**: `/api/videos/{video_id}/stream-transcode` - Real-time FFmpeg transcoding
- **Standard Stream**: `/api/videos/{video_id}/stream` - Direct file streaming for MP4/WebM
- **Response Headers**: `X-Transcode-Mode: remux|transcode` indicates processing method

#### Frontend Integration
- **Automatic Detection**: Frontend detects `.mkv` file extension
- **Smart Routing**: MKV files automatically routed to transcode endpoint
- **Seamless UX**: Users experience smooth playback regardless of source format
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback and timeout detection

#### Technical Implementation
- **Async Streaming**: FastAPI async generators for efficient streaming
- **Process Management**: Proper FFmpeg process lifecycle and cleanup
- **Codec Detection**: JSON-based ffprobe output parsing
- **Progressive Playback**: Fragmented MP4 with `frag_keyframe+empty_moov` flags
- **Client Disconnect Handling**: FFmpeg processes terminated on client disconnect

#### Supported Formats
- **Input**: MKV containers with various codecs (H.264, H.265, VP9, etc.)
- **Output**: MP4 container with H.264 video + AAC audio
- **Performance**:
  - Remux mode: Near-instant start (just container change)
  - Transcode mode: Real-time encoding with `veryfast` preset

#### User Experience
- Play MKV files directly in browser without manual conversion
- Automatic quality optimization based on source codecs
- Transparent processing - users see standard video player
- Works across all video interfaces (gallery, detail, modal)

## API Development & Testing

### Authentication Requirements

**IMPORTANT:** All MVidarr API endpoints require session-based authentication. This is critical for both development and testing.

#### Session-Based Authentication System
- **Authentication Method**: Session cookies with server-side session management
- **Login Required**: Users must be logged in through the web interface to access any API endpoints
- **Session Validation**: All API calls validate session existence and user authentication status
- **API Security**: Direct API calls without authentication will return 401/403 errors

#### Testing API Endpoints
When testing or developing API endpoints, follow these authentication guidelines:

```bash
# ❌ INCORRECT - Direct cURL calls will fail with authentication errors
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/videos/123/extract-ffmpeg-metadata

# ✅ CORRECT - Test through authenticated web interface
# 1. Log into MVidarr web interface first
# 2. Use browser developer tools to test API calls
# 3. Or use authenticated requests through the web interface
```

#### Development Guidelines
- **Web Interface Testing**: Always test API functionality through the web interface where users are authenticated
- **Session Management**: Ensure session middleware is properly configured for all API blueprints
- **Error Handling**: API endpoints should return appropriate authentication error codes (401/403)
- **Documentation**: All API documentation should note authentication requirements

#### Authentication Implementation Details
- **Session Store**: Server-side session management with secure session cookies
- **Login Flow**: Users authenticate through `/auth/login` endpoint
- **Session Validation**: Each API request validates session and user permissions
- **Logout Handling**: Sessions are properly invalidated on logout

**Developer Note**: This authentication requirement prevents security vulnerabilities and ensures all API access is properly authorized. Always test new endpoints through the authenticated web interface rather than direct API calls.

#### v0.12.1 Release ✅ COMPLETE
- **Status**: Released 2026-02-12
- **Summary**: Stabilization of v0.12.0 security hardening - fixed WAF false positives, auth bridge, playlist sync, CI/CD formatting

#### Video Quality Improvements (360p → 1080p)

##### Problem
Downloads consistently returning 360p instead of best available quality.

##### Current Flow (Working Correctly)
```
Database Settings (default_video_quality, max_video_quality, min_video_quality)
    ↓
video_quality_service.get_user_quality_preferences()
    ↓
video_quality_service.generate_ytdlp_format_string()
    ↓
ytdlp_download_manager.start_download(quality_format_string)
    ↓
youtube_download_engine.download_video(quality=format_string)
```

##### Root Cause Analysis
- Format string IS being generated from user settings
- **Missing format sorting (`-S` flag)** to prioritize resolution over bitrate
- yt-dlp may select lower quality if bitrate is higher
- TV client may have limited format availability
- No explicit codec preferences in yt-dlp command

##### Recommended Fixes (youtube_download_engine.py)

1. **Add Format Sorting (`-S` flag)** - CRITICAL: Prioritize resolution over bitrate
   ```python
   # In _build_download_command() after format string:
   # This ensures yt-dlp selects higher resolution even if lower bitrate
   cmd.extend(["-S", "res,ext:mp4:m4a,vcodec:h264,acodec:aac"])
   ```
   **Location**: `youtube_download_engine.py` line ~294 (after `-f` format string)

2. **Parse User's Max Quality Setting** - Extract height from format string
   ```python
   # Extract max height from quality format string for -S parameter
   import re
   height_match = re.search(r'height<=(\d+)', quality)
   max_height = height_match.group(1) if height_match else "1080"
   cmd.extend(["-S", f"res:{max_height},ext:mp4:m4a,vcodec:h264"])
   ```

3. **Add Player Client Fallback** - Try multiple clients for better format availability:
   ```python
   # In _get_tv_client_args():
   "--extractor-args", "youtube:player_client=tv,web"  # Fallback to web for more formats
   ```

4. **Force MP4 Container** - Consistent output format:
   ```python
   "--remux-video", "mp4"
   ```

5. **Verbose Format Debugging** - Add logging to diagnose issues:
   ```python
   "--print-to-file", "formats", "/tmp/ytdlp_formats.txt"  # Log available formats
   ```

##### Implementation Files
- `src/services/youtube_download_engine.py` - Main download logic
- `src/services/video_quality_service.py` - Quality settings
- `src/services/ytdlp_service.py` - yt-dlp wrapper

##### Testing
- Test with known 1080p videos
- Compare format listings before/after changes
- Verify TV client + web fallback works

### Branch Strategy
- **Primary Development**: All changes must be pushed to the `dev` branch
- **Main Branch**: Changes can only be made to `main` after approval on `dev`
- **Feature Branches**: Create feature branches from `dev`, merge back to `dev`
- **Current Version**: v0.12.7 (Dependency Cleanup & Test Infrastructure)
- **Development Focus**: Stability, security
- **Next Version**: v0.12.8

### Code Development Process
1. Create feature branch from `dev` branch
2. Make code changes
3. Run formatting: `~/.local/bin/black src/ && ~/.local/bin/isort --profile black src/`
4. Verify formatting: `~/.local/bin/black --check src/ && ~/.local/bin/isort --profile black --check-only src/`
5. **Update version metadata** (before committing major changes)
6. Commit and push to feature branch
7. Create PR to `dev` branch
8. After approval, merge to `dev`
9. Monitor GitHub Actions for any CI/CD issues

### Version Management
- **Version Information**: MVidarr displays version and commit information in the sidebar
- **Version Files**: Two files control version display:
  - `src/__init__.py` - Contains `__version__` variable
  - `version.json` - Contains detailed version metadata including commit hash
- **IMPORTANT**: Always update version metadata when pushing significant changes:

#### Updating Version Metadata
```bash
# Get current commit and timestamp
CURRENT_COMMIT=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)
CURRENT_TIMESTAMP=$(date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%6N")

# Update version.json with current commit and build date
# Keep version number the same unless explicitly incrementing
# For beta releases, use format: 0.x.y-beta.z
cat > version.json << EOF
{
  "version": "0.10.0-beta.1",
  "build_date": "$CURRENT_TIMESTAMP",
  "git_commit": "$CURRENT_COMMIT",
  "git_branch": "dev",
  "release_name": "v0.10.0-beta.1 - First Beta Release",
  "features": [
    "🔒 Security: Resolved 10 critical vulnerabilities",
    "🔧 Installation Wizard for first-run setup",
    "🎬 Reliable video import system (no duplicates)",
    "✅ API validation before configuration"
  ],
  "beta_notes": [
    "This is a BETA release - not yet production-ready",
    "Report issues: https://github.com/prefect421/mvidarr/issues"
  ]
}
EOF

# Commit the version update
git add version.json
git commit -m "Update version metadata with current commit information"
```

#### Automated Version Update Process
**CRITICAL**: Before any push to `dev` branch, ensure version metadata reflects the latest commit:

1. **Update commit hash**: Use `git rev-parse --short HEAD` to get current commit
2. **Update build date**: Use current UTC timestamp
3. **Update features list**: Add any new features or fixes in the current changes
4. **Commit version file**: Include version.json in your commit
5. **Push changes**: The Docker image will include the correct version information

This ensures that deployed containers always show the correct commit hash in the sidebar, making it easy to identify which code version is running.

#### Quick Version Update Script
For convenience, use the automated script:

```bash
# Run the version update script
./scripts/update_version.sh

# Commit the updated version file
git add version.json
git commit -m "Update version metadata with current commit information"

# Push changes
git push origin dev
```

**Best Practice**: Run `./scripts/update_version.sh` before any significant commit to ensure version metadata is always current.
