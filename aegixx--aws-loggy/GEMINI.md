## Development

```bash
npm start          # Run app in dev mode with hot reload
npm run app:build  # Build production app
npm run fmt        # Format code
npm run lint       # Lint code
npm test           # Run tests
npm run test:watch # Run tests in watch mode
```

## Code Style

- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Prefer functional components with hooks
- Use Zustand for state management
- Follow existing patterns in codebase
- Pre-commit hook runs `fmt`, `lint`, and `build` automatically

## Testing

Uses Vitest with React Testing Library. Tests are in `*.test.ts` / `*.test.tsx` files alongside source.

```bash
npm test           # Run all tests
npm run test:watch # Run in watch mode
```

## Common Tasks

### Adding a new component

1. Create component in `src/components/`
2. Export from component file
3. Import where needed
4. Run `npm run fmt && npm run lint`

### Modifying log parsing

- Edit `parseLogLevel()` in `src/utils/logParsing.ts`
- Default log levels: `error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug`, `trace`, `system`, `unknown`
- Log levels are configurable in Settings (colors, keywords, default visibility)

### Adding Tauri commands

1. Add command in `src-tauri/src/lib.rs`
2. Register in `tauri::Builder`
3. Call from frontend via `invoke()`

## Menu Bar

The Loggy application menu includes:

| Item                 | Description                                                        |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |

| Check for Updates... | Manually check for updates (shows result in status bar and dialog) |
| Preferences... (⌘,)  | Open settings                                                      |
| Demo Mode            | Toggle demo mode with mock Lambda data (no AWS required)           |
| New Window (⌘N)      | Spawn a new Loggy window as a separate OS process                  |

## Context Menu

Right-click on any log row to access the context menu with the following options:

| Action         | Description                                                    |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Copy/Copy sel. | Copy selection (if text selected), multi-selected rows, or row |
| Copy All       | Copy all logs in group (ignores filters). Group headers only.  |
| Find "..."     | Open Find dialog with selected text (requires text selection)  |
| Filter by      | Submenu with filtering options (see below)                     |
| Refresh        | Reconnect to AWS and re-query logs                             |
| Clear          | Clear logs and re-fetch                                        |

### Filter by Submenu

| Option     | Description                                                 |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Selection  | Filter by selected text (requires text selection)           |
| Request ID | Filter by `metadata.requestId:value` (if requestId present) |
| Trace ID   | Filter by `metadata.traceId:value` (if traceId present)     |
| Client IP  | Filter by `metadata.clientIp:value` (if clientIP present)   |

**Note**: "Find" requires text selection in the expanded detail view. "Filter by" menu is disabled when no options are available. Each filter option checks both top-level and `metadata` nested fields (e.g., `requestId`, `RequestId`, `metadata.requestId`).

## Group By

The filter bar includes a "Group by" dropdown that organizes logs into collapsible sections:

| Mode        | Description                                                       |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| No grouping | Default flat timeline view                                        |
| Stream      | Groups logs by log stream name                                    |
| Invocation  | Groups by Lambda invocation (START/END markers). Lambda only.     |
| Auto        | Invocation for `/aws/lambda/*` groups, Stream for everything else |

Group headers show metadata (log count, error indicator, relative time). Invocation headers additionally show request ID, duration, and memory usage parsed from Lambda REPORT lines. In-progress invocations (during live tail) show an "In progress" badge until the REPORT line arrives.

Grouping is purely visual — filtering, find-in-log, and selection operate on individual log rows unchanged.

## Group Filter Toggle

A toggle inside the filter input (layers icon) that switches text filtering to group scope:

- **ON (default)**: Shows all groups containing at least one text match; all logs in matching groups are visible (level filtering still per-row)
- **OFF**: Current behavior — only individually matching rows shown
- Only visible when grouping is active (Stream or Invocation mode)
- Persisted across sessions
- Does not affect log level filtering — levels always filter per-row

## Time Presets

The filter bar time quickfilter buttons are customizable in Settings (CMD-,):

- Up to 5 presets, each with a duration value and unit (minutes/hours/days)
- Defaults: 15m, 1h, 6h, 24h, 7d
- Add, remove, reorder, and reset to defaults
- Calendar picker (custom date range) always available regardless of presets
- Presets persisted to localStorage via settingsStore

## Notes

- AWS credentials use default provider chain (profiles, SSO, env vars)
- SSO credentials auto-refresh within a valid SSO session (no manual intervention needed)
- When SSO session expires, the app automatically opens the SSO login URL in the browser using `aws sso login --profile <profile>`
- After opening SSO login, the app polls every 2 seconds (up to 2 minutes) to detect when credentials become valid
- When credentials are valid, `aws-session-refreshed` event is emitted and the connection automatically refreshes
- Frontend also receives `aws-session-expired` event for UI feedback
- `reconnect_aws` Tauri command re-initializes the AWS client after credential refresh
- `refreshConnection` store action calls `reconnect_aws` and re-fetches logs with current filters
- Log cache limits configurable in Settings (default: 50,000 entries OR 100 MB)
- Live tail uses CloudWatch StartLiveTail streaming API (1-second updates from AWS) with per-panel sessions
- Falls back to 1-second polling if streaming is unavailable or sampling detected (2-second overlap window prevents event gaps)
- Sampling detection: if 500 events in one update, switches to polling from last clean timestamp
- Stream error handling: session limit exceeded → polling with toast; permission denied → error dialog and stop; other errors → silent polling fallback
- Follow mode auto-scrolls to latest during live tail; pauses when scrolled up; "Jump to latest" button to resume
- Transport indicator shows "Streaming" or "Polling" during live tail
- Log group selector uses Fuse.js fuzzy matching with virtualized dropdown (keyboard nav: ArrowUp/Down, Enter, Escape)
- Filter bar uses AND matching: space-separated terms must all be present (in any order)
- Default time range is 15 minutes
- react-window v2 API differs from v1 (use `List`, not `FixedSizeList`)
- Settings persisted to localStorage via zustand/persist middleware
- Last selected log group is remembered and auto-selected on app launch
- Auto-update checks for new GitHub Releases on startup (configurable in Settings)
- Homebrew tap: `aegixx/homebrew-aws-loggy` — cask auto-updated by release workflow
- WinGet package: `SteampunkLabs.AWSLoggy` — manifest auto-submitted by release workflow via `vedantmgoyal9/winget-releaser`

## Demo Mode

- Toggled via Loggy > Demo Mode menu item (works in published builds)
- Hides real AWS profiles and shows only mock log groups when active
- Intercepts all Tauri `invoke()` calls at the frontend layer (`src/demo/demoInvoke.ts`)
- Provides 4 Lambda log groups with realistic invocations (START/END/REPORT, structured JSON, errors)
- Live tail simulation via `DemoTailTransport` generates new invocations every ~1.5 seconds
- StatusBar shows orange "DEMO" badge; profile dropdown shows "demo" and is disabled
- Toggling off reconnects to real AWS automatically
- Demo state is not persisted — always starts in normal mode

## Multi-Process

Multiple Loggy windows can run simultaneously, each as a separate OS process with its own AWS client and live tail. Good for monitoring `dev` and `prod` at the same time without switching profiles.

- **Launch:** `Loggy → New Window` (⌘N) in the running app spawns a fresh process. On macOS, this shells out to `open -n -a <path-to-Loggy.app>`. On Linux/Windows, it spawns the current binary detached.
- **CLI:** `open -n -a /Applications/Loggy.app` on macOS works as a side effect of the storage split — no single-instance lock blocks a second launch.
- **Primary vs Secondary:** The first process to start acquires an advisory file lock at `<app-data>/loggy.lock` and becomes the **primary**. Subsequent processes become **secondaries**. Role is set at boot and never changes. Primary owns per-window workspace state (layout, AWS profile, per-panel configs) in `localStorage`; secondaries run that state in memory only and discard it on close.
- **Shared settings:** UI preferences (theme, log levels, cache limits, auto-update, time presets, saved workspaces) live in `<app-data>/settings.json` and sync across all windows via a `notify` file watcher. Changing a color in one window updates the others within ~400ms.
- **Identification:** Window title becomes `Loggy — <profile>`. Status bar shows a colored profile badge (djb2-hashed HSL, orange excluded to avoid clashing with DEMO).
- **Incompatible plugin:** Do NOT add `tauri-plugin-single-instance`; it would break the multi-process launch flow. See `src-tauri/src/instance.rs` for the design rationale.
- **Testing in dev:** `npm start` launches a single Tauri dev process; a second `npm start` just focuses the first. To test multi-process behavior, run `npm run app:build` then `open -n -a src-tauri/target/release/bundle/macos/Loggy.app` from a terminal.
