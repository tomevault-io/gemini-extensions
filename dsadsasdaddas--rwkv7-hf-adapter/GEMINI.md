## Project Mission

This repository is now scoped to the **RWKV-7 Hugging Face / Transformers adapter only**.

Historical upstream context mentioned three independent tracks: Hugging Face,
vLLM, and SGLang. For this repository and active work, do **not** build or gate
native vLLM/SGLang integrations. Any vLLM/SGLang work is a separate future
project and must not block HF deliverables.

The active reward target is the HF/Transformers track: make RWKV-7 usable from
standard HF APIs with near-production correctness, performance, memory behavior,
training compatibility, quantized inference, and reproducible benchmarks.

## Current Agent Contract: Native Fused HF Backend

This is the active contract for the next workers on this branch. Treat
`FUSED_BACKEND.md` and `docs/native_fused_roadmap.md` as the performance
roadmap.

- Scope is **HF adapter only**. Do not implement or gate native vLLM/SGLang
  integrations in this repository.
- Keep HF compatibility as the invariant: `AutoModelForCausalLM`, `generate`,
  PEFT, Trainer, TRL, `RWKV7StateCache`, dynamic batching, chunked prefill,
  save/load, and quantized loading must keep working.
- Move the speed core to native fused backends: fused fp16 first, then fused
  quant. The wrapper is the compatibility shell, not the place for the next
  performance breakthrough.
- Use official math alignment from `rwkv_v7_numpy.py` and
  `run_rwkv7_qwen35.py`; preserve exact RWKV-7 recurrence, clamp, state, and
  output semantics before optimizing layout.
- Follow train_temp-style fused boundaries: `tmix_mix6`, `kk_pre/state_prep`,
  `lnx_rkvres_xg`, `cmix`, and `clampw`.
- Use Albatross-style GPU-specific layout/autotune. Exact-card rows decide
  defaults; V100, 4090, A100/H100, and Blackwell must not blindly share tile
  choices.
- Treat DPLR/chunked prefill as the bsz=1 prompt-prefill breakthrough line.
  Do not spend the next phase on wrapper/cache micro-optimizations.
- Forbidden directions: wrapper micro-optimization as the main plan, native
  vLLM/SGLang work, defaulting the full-head scan+output fused prefill path,
  and quantized-speed claims before a native fused quant kernel beats fp16
  end-to-end.
- Required next validation loop: RTX 4090 fp16, bsz=1/4, prompt512 prefill,
  decode, correctness, peak memory/VRAM, and `bench/analyze_results.py`
  reporting.

## Current Branch Goal: DPLR/WY Compiled Prefill Prototype

Active branch work is now the opt-in DPLR/WY compiled prefill backend, not
wrapper micro-optimization. Keep the default HF behavior unchanged unless a
benchmark explicitly opts in.

Goal:

- Move `dplr_chunk_scan(algorithm="wy"/"lowrank")` from pure torch
  correctness prototype toward a real Triton/CUDA performance prototype.
- Maintain native VxK state layout `[B,H,N,N]`, fp16/bf16/fp32 token inputs,
  and fp32 state accumulation.
- Synthetic first: support the critical target
  `B=1,H=16,N=64,T=512,chunk_size=64,fp16` on RTX 4090.
- Correctness gates: match `torch_recurrent_scan`; for fp16 target require
  `out_min_cosine >= 0.9999` and keep greedy/cache smoke passing when routed
  through HF repo-code loading.

Current implementation state:

- `rwkv7_hf/dplr_prefill_triton.py` exposes:
  - `dplr_chunk_scan_triton(...)` / `dplr_chunk_scan_triton_available()`
  - dense chunk summary: `dplr_dense_chunk_summary_*`
  - dense prefix combine: `dplr_dense_prefix_combine_*`
  - dense chunk apply/output: `dplr_dense_chunk_apply_*`
  - dense three-stage scaffold: `dplr_dense_three_stage_triton(...)`
- `algorithm="triton_wy"` is the P0 compiled bridge using the existing fused
  recurrent scan. It is fast and correctness-passing, but it is not yet compact
  WY.
- `algorithm="triton_dense3"` is the explicit dense three-stage scaffold
  (summary -> prefix -> apply/output). It proves the mathematical kernel
  boundaries, but it materializes dense `[N,N]` summaries and is expected to be
  slower than the P0 fused scan until replaced with compact WY factors.

Latest RTX 4090 target evidence:

- Synthetic `B=1,T=512,H=16,N=64,chunk=64,fp16`:
  - `sequential`: pass, about `55.63 ms`, `9.2k tok/s`
  - `triton_wy`: pass, about `0.233 ms`, `2.20M tok/s`,
    `out_min_cosine ~= 0.9999999`
  - `triton_dense3`: pass; latest stage-probe full row is about
    `0.264-0.269 ms`, `~1.9M tok/s`, `out_min_cosine = 1.0`
  - dense stage split from `--stage-probe`: summary `~0.144 ms`, prefix
    `~0.092 ms`, apply/output `~0.065 ms`, summary shape
    `[1,8,16,64,64]`. Dense summary/prefix `[N,N]` traffic is the first
    compact-WY target.
- HF repo-code smoke on 4090 / 0.4B / prompt512 / bsz1:
  - Sweep path: `/tmp/native_4090_todo_sweep_20260702_103919.jsonl`.
  - Albatross reference for this shape remains `52,148.52 tok/s`; `0.45x`
    is `23,467 tok/s`.
  - DPLR repo-code rows: `triton_wy` pass at `20,421.7 tok/s` (`0.3916x`),
    `triton_dense3` pass at `18,546.0 tok/s` (`0.3556x`),
    `triton_wy_compact` pass at `17,970.5 tok/s` (`0.3446x`).
  - Fastest short sweep row was the fused recurrent scan path, not DPLR:
    `RWKV7_NATIVE_PREFILL_FUSED_SCAN=1`,
    `RWKV7_NATIVE_PREFILL_SCAN_BLOCK_M=8`,
    `RWKV7_NATIVE_PREFILL_SCAN_NUM_WARPS=1`,
    `RWKV7_NATIVE_PREFILL_FUSED_STATE_PREP=1`; pass at `22,777.0 tok/s`
    (`0.4368x`) and `991.2 MiB`.
  - Confirmation for that older split setting:
    `/tmp/native_4090_todo_confirm_20260702_104202.jsonl`, pass at
    `22,292.0 tok/s` (`0.4275x`), below the `0.45x` target.
  - Breakdown path: `/tmp/native_4090_todo_breakdown_20260702_104126.jsonl`.
    Top components for the best fused-scan setting are recurrent scan
    `7.4571 ms` / `26.34%`, FFN `4.0836 ms` / `14.42%`,
    attention norm+shift-mix `3.8040 ms` / `13.44%`, and fused state prep
    `3.2982 ms` / `11.65%`.
  - New opt-in fused state-prep + recurrent scan row:
    `RWKV7_NATIVE_PREFILL_FUSED_STATE_SCAN=1` and
    `RWKV7_NATIVE_PREFILL_FUSED_OUTPUT=1` with path
    `/tmp/native_4090_fused_state_scan_confirm_20260702_111924.jsonl` passes
    greedy/cache smoke at `25,663.2 tok/s`, `19.9507 ms`, `0.4921x`
    Albatross, and `989.2 MiB` peak VRAM. This closes the 0.45x checkpoint but
    remains below the `0.60x` stretch target (`31,289 tok/s`).
  - DPLR compact retest after the launch-count reduction is still slower:
    `/tmp/native_4090_dplr_compact_retest_20260702_111924.jsonl`,
    `16,863.4 tok/s`, `30.3616 ms`, `0.3234x` Albatross, greedy/cache smoke
    passing. Keep DPLR compact as high-upside work, but its next useful step is
    DPLR-specific apply/output fusion rather than wrapper-level changes.
  - Prefill fused-output-project is now an opt-in experiment
    (`RWKV7_NATIVE_PREFILL_FUSED_OUTPUT_PROJECT=1`) for evidence only. The
    first 4090 row `/tmp/native_4090_output_project_20260702_104430.jsonl`
    passed correctness but was slower (`18,228.8 tok/s`), so it must remain
    disabled by default.

Remaining before this goal is complete:

- Compact WY torch reference, dense reconstruction oracle, and first Triton
  compact summary kernel now exist via
  `dplr_compact_wy_chunk_summary_torch`,
  `dplr_compact_wy_chunk_summary_triton`,
  `dplr_compact_wy_summary_to_dense`, and
  `dplr_compact_wy_apply_summaries_torch`. The first Triton compact kernel is
  target-constrained to `N<=64, chunk_size<=64`; 4090 target factor diff is
  `<=5.96e-08`, final state diff is `~1.13e-04`, and summary time is
  `~0.155 ms`. Compact prefix combine now exists via
  `dplr_compact_wy_prefix_combine_torch` and
  `dplr_compact_wy_prefix_combine_triton`; 4090 target prefix time is
  `~0.067 ms` with starts diff vs dense `~5.96e-08`. The next required
  step is reusing current chunk apply/output to make a compact three-stage
  route. That route now exists as `dplr_compact_wy_three_stage_triton`; 4090
  target correctness passes (`out_min_cosine=1.0`, state diff
  `~1.26e-04` in the benchmark row). It is exposed as
  `RWKV7_DPLR_PREFILL_ALGORITHM=triton_wy_compact`; latest 4090 synthetic
  target benchmark is `~0.241 ms`, `~2.12M tok/s`, close to P0 `triton_wy`
  (`~0.228 ms`). HF repo-code smoke 0.4B/prompt512/bsz1 passes greedy/cache
  at `~17.5k tok/s`.
- Replace dense `[N,N]` transition/additive runtime summaries with compact
  WY/low-rank factors to reduce memory traffic and close the Albatross gap.
- Make the explicit three-stage path at least competitive with the P0 fused
  recurrent scan; current dense3 is correctness-first and slower than P0.
- The 4090 native prefill benchmark has moved 0.4B prompt512 bsz1 past the
  `>=0.45x` checkpoint with the opt-in fused state-scan row (`0.4921x`). The
  remaining stretch is `>=0.60x`; current gap is about `5,626 tok/s`. The next
  concrete kernel task is deeper fusion beyond state-prep+scan, especially
  output-prep/application fusion and DPLR-specific apply/output fusion;
  wrapper-only work is not the performance route.
- Do not call the DPLR/WY goal finished until compact WY or an equivalent
  compiled path is verified end-to-end against the original acceptance target.

## Active Goal: Finish the Current HF Adapter First

Current priority: finish the RWKV-7 Hugging Face / Transformers adapter with
the hardware and evidence available now. Do not wait for H100/4090/5090/A100
access before completing the current repository deliverables. V100 remains the
active development and regression baseline; newer GPUs are follow-up validation
targets once available.

The current delivery strategy is:

- Keep the HF wrapper as the production-facing compatibility layer for
  `AutoModelForCausalLM`, `generate`, PEFT, Trainer, TRL, state cache,
  dynamic batching, chunked prefill, quantization, speculative decoding, and
  benchmark gates.
- Stop treating wrapper micro-optimization as the performance plan. The
  wrapper may be changed for HF compatibility, correctness, telemetry, and
  dispatch, but new speed wins should come from native fused fp16 kernels and
  later fused native W8/W4 kernels. `native_jit`, `native_graph`, cache reuse,
  and reduced launch count are fallback/baseline layers, not the next
  breakthrough by themselves.
- Keep `native_model` explicitly experimental. It is the long-term base for
  removing the mandatory FLA runtime, upstream Transformers work, AMD/CPU
  fallback, and future kernels. It must not be described as replacing the
  wrapper until it proves the same HF compatibility, batching, cache semantics,
  and benchmark coverage.
- Do not merge older native branches wholesale when they would remove current
  HF training, quantization, cache, benchmark, or telemetry work. Audit those
  branches and port only the useful implementation ideas.

Near-term completion, without waiting for extra GPUs:

1. Done: preserve V100 training telemetry for HF Trainer, TRL SFT, TRL DPO,
   and TRL GRPO in the benchmark/report pipeline.
2. Done: add Albatross A/B benchmark ingestion on the same checkpoint, V100,
   dtype, batch size, prompt length, decode length, and cache policy.
3. Done: harden the experimental native/no-FLA HF path with smoke tests for
   Trainer, TRL SFT, TRL DPO, TRL GRPO, PEFT adapter save/load/merge, Trainer
   checkpoint resume, and bnb W8/W4 functional quantized inference. These are
   compatibility gates only; they do not close the Albatross or quantized-speed
   gaps.
4. Current: finish W8/W4 reporting and gates so the repository clearly records
   both the memory-target bnb rows and the fastest passing hybrid variants.
5. Current: keep code/tests/docs green locally without CUDA, then merge only
   changes that preserve existing HF training, cache, quantization, benchmark,
   and telemetry behavior.
6. Current no-GPU task: finish executable DeepSpeed ZeRO-2/ZeRO-3 HF Trainer
   smoke harness, analyzer/report ingestion, docs, and local tests. Real pass
   rows can wait for live GPU/DeepSpeed access, but the repository should be
   ready to run them with one command.
7. Current performance phase: follow `docs/performance/FUSED_BACKEND.md` for the native fused
   fp16 -> native W8/W4 backend. The analyzer must track Albatross ratio
   ladders and quantized speed/footprint gates under `fused_backend_targets`.
8. Next when GPUs return: expand V100 evidence for large-model smoke,
   speed/precision sweeps, chunked prefill, dynamic batching, state-cache reuse,
   speculative decoding, and ZeRO-2/ZeRO-3 multi-GPU smoke.
9. Later validation: run the prepared benchmark matrix on H100/4090/5090/A100.
   These newer cards are validation targets, not blockers for current progress.

Current no-GPU work mode:

- Finish everything that does not require live CUDA access first: HF API
  compatibility code, analyzers, benchmark ingestion, result gates, docs, unit
  tests, and PR hygiene.
- Treat existing V100 evidence as the active baseline until GPUs return. Do not
  block merges on new H100/4090/5090/A100 numbers.
- Keep GPU-only work as explicit follow-up rows in `BENCHMARK.md` /
  `docs/archive/NEXT_STEPS.md`: fresh speed sweeps, large-model runs, fused W8/W4 kernels,
  ZeRO-2/3 multi-GPU validation, and cross-card validation.
- The immediate finish line for this repository is a clean HF adapter that can
  be reviewed, installed, tested, and benchmarked reproducibly; vLLM/SGLang and
  DFlash stay outside the current merge gate.
- Do not start vLLM/SGLang work in this repository while the HF adapter still
  has open local tasks. First finish the HF adapter evidence, gates, and docs.

## Target Acceptance Criteria

Use this HF-only checklist as the authoritative target for the active
deliverable:

1. Match or approach the current RWKV-LM and Albatross training/inference
   performance, speed, precision, and memory use through HF-compatible paths
   across common batch sizes.
2. HF adaptation must work with common Transformer-based PEFT, RL, and training
   libraries, including PEFT, TRL, SFT/DPO/GRPO-style workflows, Trainer-style
   loops, gradient accumulation, and real multi-batch training smoke tests.
3. HF serving helpers must expose RWKV recurrent state cache semantics, dynamic
   batch select/reorder/drop, chunked prefill, state-cache allocation/reuse, and
   cache-reuse metrics that can later be reused by serving integrations.
4. Hardware support should cover common professional and consumer GPUs:
   NVIDIA from Pascal onward where feasible, newer NVIDIA generations, and AMD
   GPUs. HF inference should keep a path toward PP/TP, and HF training should
   support DeepSpeed ZeRO-2 and ZeRO-3 where feasible.
5. Quantized inference must support common W8 and W4 modes, reduce memory
   accordingly, and be faster than W16 on common cards. Older cards may need
   dedicated optimization. Quality should get as close as possible to
   llama.cpp-style Q*_K_M levels.
6. Add initial HF-compatible speculative decoding support, such as using a
   smaller RWKV model as the draft model. DFlash, native vLLM/SGLang adapters,
   and deeper standalone serving-engine work stay as follow-up projects.

Benchmark comparisons must separate engine performance from model quality:

- Albatross is the high-performance RWKV inference-engine reference. Compare it
  against this repository on the same checkpoint, hardware, dtype, batch size,
  prompt length, decode length, and cache policy. Track prefill tok/s, decode
  tok/s, aggregate tok/s, latency percentiles, memory footprint, peak VRAM,
  state-cache reuse/hit rate, and dynamic-batch behavior.
- Qwen3.5 is the model-quality target. The overall model-level goal is to
  exceed comparable Qwen3.5 baselines on instruction quality, reasoning, math,
  code, multilingual/Chinese, long-context, and RL/PEFT training workflows. Do
  not treat an inference-engine speed win as proof of beating Qwen3.5 quality;
  require explicit evaluation rows and reproducible prompts/datasets.

The final implementation should approach the performance, speed, precision, and memory usage of the official RWKV-LM path and Albatross path across different batch sizes.

### HF Transformers Track

Required goals:

- Convert official RWKV-7 `.pth` checkpoints to Hugging Face format.
- Provide `RWKV7Config`, `RWKV7Model`, and `RWKV7ForCausalLM`.
- Provide RWKV tokenizer support.
- Support `AutoConfig.from_pretrained`, `AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained`, and
  `AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained`.
- Support `generate(..., use_cache=True)` with RWKV recurrent state cache.
- Support HF-style recurrent-state utilities for serving-like usage:
  state-cache allocation/reuse, dynamic batch select/reorder/drop/compact,
  chunked prefill, offload/restore, and cache telemetry.
- Support PEFT LoRA workflows and common HF training / RL libraries, especially
  PEFT, Trainer, TRL `SFTTrainer`, `DPOTrainer`, and `GRPOTrainer`-style flows.
- Support DeepSpeed ZeRO-2/ZeRO-3 presets where feasible through HF training
  entrypoints.
- Support 8-bit and 4-bit HF inference paths that reduce memory, preserve
  quality as much as possible, and target speed no slower than W16 on common
  cards.
- Add initial HF-compatible speculative decoding support, such as a smaller
  RWKV draft model verified by a larger HF RWKV target model.
- Keep a migration path toward an upstreamable native Transformers
  implementation without a mandatory FLA runtime dependency.

### Hardware Support

Required goals:

- Support common professional GPUs.
- Support common consumer GPUs.
- Current development server has 2 x Tesla V100-PCIE-32GB.
- V100 is acceptable for smoke tests and development, but final performance work
  should also be validated on newer cards such as A100/H100/4090/5090 where
  available.
- AMD GPU support remains a compatibility target for the HF path, preferably via
  pure PyTorch/reference paths first and optional kernels later.

### GPU-Specific Kernel Policy Registry

This is a **live per-GPU adaptation contract**, not a historical notes section.
Every time this project touches a new card, add or update the card/family rule
here and the machine-readable rule in `rwkv7_hf/kernel_policy.py`. Do not leave
new hardware as an implicit "works on my GPU" case.

For every card that is developed, rented, borrowed, or used for validation,
record the following before claiming support:

1. Exact identity: GPU name, SM/ROCm target, driver, CUDA/ROCm, PyTorch, Triton,
   model checkpoint, dtype, and batch/prompt/decode matrix.
2. Runtime policy: `rwkv7_hf/kernel_policy.py` classification plus default-on
   and default-off kernels for that card/family.
3. AGENTS contract: this section must say which kernels are allowed by default,
   which are opt-in only, and which benchmark rows are mandatory.
4. Evidence rows: append `bench/results.jsonl` rows for functional smoke,
   decode, prefill, cache, and quant axes that are being claimed.
5. Analyzer support: update `bench/analyze_results.py` / summaries whenever a
   new axis, gate, or card-local metric is added.

Environment variables always override the policy. The policy is only the safe
default selected when the user does not set explicit flags. Policy coverage and
validation are separate: a family can have a conservative routing rule before it
has production evidence, but it is not a validated production target until the
required exact-card rows exist in `bench/results.jsonl`.

Current exact-card evidence status:

- V100 (`sm_70`): active regression baseline; preserve training/PEFT/TRL/cache
  and decode greedy-match rows before changing defaults.
- RTX 4090 (`sm_89`): active Ada consumer validation card; native fused prefill
  scan plus state-prep fusion is promising under explicit A/B flags, while
  WAVG/projection fusion is still opt-in because shallow LoRA grouping regresses
  end-to-end even when isolated rows improve. Full-head scan+output-prep fusion
  is also negative telemetry on Ada because it gives up the split-row scan tile
  that currently keeps prefill occupancy acceptable. Per-layer bsz=1 breakdown
  shows the prefill gap is broad across layers, so pursue reusable per-layer
  fusion patterns rather than layer-specific patches.
- RTX 5070 Laptop / 50-series (`sm_120` observed): touched Blackwell path; native
  no-FLA compatibility is important because some FLA training kernels can be
  architecture-limited; fusion wins must be re-proven end-to-end on each 50-card.
- A800 (`sm_80`): touched Ampere server validation card; 0.4B / 1.5B /
  2.9B bsz=1/2/4 batch sweep and W8/W4 memory-policy quantization rows exist
  on `NVIDIA A800-SXM4-80GB`, plus 2.9B HF `larger_model_smoke` and 0.4B
  Trainer / TRL SFT smoke rows. Keep the Ampere defaults conservative: output
  fusions remain allowed, prefill-scan and projection/LoRA fusions stay opt-in
  until exact-card sweeps prove end-to-end value.
- Pascal/Turing/Hopper/AMD: registry rules exist, but support remains TODO
  until exact-card rows are added.

#### Per-GPU adaptation checklist

Run this checklist for every new GPU before marking it as supported:

- Functional: import/from_pretrained, `generate(use_cache=True)`,
  `rwkv7_forward_token`, batch cache, dynamic batch select/reorder/drop,
  chunked prefill, save/reload, and greedy-match decode.
- Decode performance: `bench_batch_sweep.py` for `bsz=1/2/4/8`,
  `bench_native_graph_overhead.py`, native_graph cache hit/miss telemetry, and
  per-step tok/s/latency.
- Prefill performance: `bench_native_prefill_scan.py` when fast prefill is
  claimed; compare HF/FLA prefill against native prefill and record cache handoff
  correctness.
- Fused kernels: fused recurrent-output and fused output integration smokes;
  projection/LoRA/layout sweeps before any projection default; full native_graph
  end-to-end rows before promotion.
- Quantization: W8/W4 footprint, speed, greedy/quality rows. Microbench wins are
  never enough for a speed claim; require end-to-end decode evidence.
- Training, if claimed: HF Trainer, PEFT LoRA, TRL SFT/DPO/GRPO, checkpoint
  resume, and ZeRO-2/ZeRO-3 smoke on the relevant card or multi-GPU setup.
- Promotion rule: do not enable a fused/quant kernel by default unless exact-card
  rows show correctness plus non-negative end-to-end value across the claimed
  batch sizes. If bsz=1 regresses, keep the kernel opt-in even if bsz=4/8 wins.

#### Pascal / GTX 10 / P100 (`sm_60`/`sm_61`)

- Policy family: `pascal`.
- Default stance: compatibility-first; Pascal lacks the newer tensor-core path.
- Default-on: `fast_cache` only.
- Default-off: fused recurrent/output/projection/LoRA/prefill-scan kernels.
- Required validation: common functional checklist plus at least one full
  native_graph decode smoke on the exact card.
- Quant rule: memory-only until a card-local W8/W4 row beats fp16 end-to-end.
- Promotion rule: never inherit V100/4090/5070 fused defaults without Pascal rows.

#### Volta / V100 (`sm_70`)

- Policy family: `volta`.
- Role: current regression baseline and conservative production-smoke target.
- Default-on: `fast_cache`, `fused_recurrent_output`, `fused_output`.
- Default-off: `fused_recurrent`, `fused_prefill_scan`, `fused_output_project`,
  `fused_projection`, `fused_wag_lora`, `fused_wavg_lora`.
- Required validation: functional checklist plus HF Trainer, PEFT LoRA, TRL
  SFT/DPO/GRPO, checkpoint resume, decode greedy-match, cache telemetry, and
  Albatross A/B rows when available.
- Quant rule: W8/W4 memory rows are valid; speed is unsolved until native/fused
  quant beats fp16 end-to-end on V100.
- Promotion rule: any default change must preserve V100 training and decode rows.

#### Turing / RTX 20 / T4 (`sm_75`)

- Policy family: `turing`.
- Default stance: Volta-safe output fusions can be attempted, but performance is
  not claimed without Turing rows.
- Default-on: `fast_cache`, `fused_recurrent_output`, `fused_output`.
- Default-off: prefill-scan, output-project, projection, WAG/WAVG LoRA fusions.
- Required validation: common functional checklist, bsz sweep, native_graph
  overhead, quant footprint/speed, and cache hit-rate rows.
- Promotion rule: projection/LoRA fusions stay opt-in until exact-card
  native_graph end-to-end speedup is measured.

#### Ampere / A100 / A800 / RTX 30 (`sm_80`/`sm_86`)

- Policy family: `ampere`.
- Default stance: stable output/recurrent-output fusions may be enabled; larger
  batch, training, and quant behavior must be tuned per exact card.
- Default-on: `fast_cache`, `fused_recurrent_output`, `fused_output`.
- Default-off: prefill-scan by default, output-project, projection, WAG/WAVG LoRA
  fusions.
- A800 adaptation rule:
  - `NVIDIA A800-SXM4-80GB` has initial 0.4B / 1.5B / 2.9B fp16 HF adapter
    evidence for bsz=1/2/4 native_graph decode and W8/W4 memory-policy
    quantization, plus 2.9B standard loading/generation and 0.4B Trainer / TRL
    SFT smokes. These rows validate the conservative Ampere defaults only; they
    do not promote prefill-scan, output-project, projection, LoRA, or
    quantized-speed kernels.
  - Latest 2.9B prompt128/decode8 native_graph decode rows are `93.6`,
    `199.1`, and `388.5` tok/s for bsz=1/2/4, with peak VRAM `6428.9`,
    `7262.5`, and `8906.6` MiB. W8/W4 reduce 2.9B model footprint from
    `5622.4` MB to `3222.4`/`2022.4` MB but remain slower than fp16, so quant
    speed is still unsolved on A800.
- Required validation: common functional checklist, larger-batch prefill, state
  cache reuse/hit-rate rows, W8/W4 rows, and ZeRO-2/ZeRO-3 smoke when training is
  claimed.
- Promotion rule: do not assume V100/4090 block sizes; run Ampere block/layout
  sweeps before changing defaults.

#### Ada / RTX 40 / 4090 (`sm_89`)

- Policy family: `ada`.
- Role: high-end consumer validation target.
- Default-on: `fast_cache`, `fused_recurrent_output`, `fused_output`.
- Default-off: `fused_output_project`, projection/LoRA fusions, and prefill-scan
  as a default.
- 4090 adaptation rule:
  - cuBLAS/torch remains the baseline for shallow R/K/V projection; split-K/layout
    prototype rows were slower and must stay telemetry-only.
  - Native fused prefill scan can be used under explicit A/B flags
    (`RWKV7_FAST_PREFILL=1` + `RWKV7_NATIVE_PREFILL_FUSED_SCAN=1`) after
    cache-handoff correctness rows, but it is not a blanket default until the
    broader batch/model matrix passes.
  - Native prefill state-prep fusion
    (`RWKV7_NATIVE_PREFILL_FUSED_STATE_PREP=1`) is a small positive Ada probe:
    4090 / 0.4B / fp16 / prompt512 moves bsz=1 from `21857.3` to `22358.5`
    tok/s and bsz=4 stays neutral (`81144.8` tok/s). Keep it explicit until
    the larger model/card matrix passes. For this exact Ada shape,
    `RWKV7_NATIVE_PREFILL_SCAN_BLOCK_M=8` is the best recorded scan tile; `4`,
    `16`, and `32` were slower end-to-end.
  - Native fused state-prep + recurrent scan
    (`RWKV7_NATIVE_PREFILL_FUSED_STATE_SCAN=1`) is the current best Ada bsz=1
    prefill row when paired with `RWKV7_NATIVE_PREFILL_FUSED_OUTPUT=1`: 4090 /
    0.4B / fp16 / prompt512 confirms at `25,663.2 tok/s` (`0.4921x`
    Albatross) with greedy/cache smoke passing. It is opt-in only: before
    defaulting, validate bsz=1/2/4/8, larger checkpoints, memory, and other
    card families; do not reuse the Ada full-head `N=64` kernel as a generic
    V100/A100/H100/Blackwell default.
  - `RWKV7_NATIVE_PREFILL_SCAN_NUM_WARPS` is a telemetry override only. The
    4090 scan microbench shows batch-dependent winners (`8` warps at bsz=1,
    `1` warp at bsz=4), but full prefill rows do not beat the best
    state-prep-only row, so do not promote a warp count without exact-card
    end-to-end wins across the claimed bsz set.
  - `RWKV7_NATIVE_PREFILL_FUSED_SHIFT_MIX=1` supports prefill-shaped tensors
    but remains telemetry-only. 4090 isolated shift-mix is slower than torch
    addcmul, and the full-prefill row only gives a tiny bsz=4 bump while bsz=1
    stays below the best state-prep-only row. Do not default it outside a
    larger fused norm/shift/projection/state-prep design.
  - Latest fine prefill breakdown splits dense R/K/V projection separately:
    bsz=1 prompt512 has scan `7.6627ms`, LoRA sum `6.2419ms`, norm/shift/mix
    `3.8281ms`, state-prep `3.1581ms`, and dense R/K/V sum `2.2056ms`. The
    next Ada prefill experiment should fuse across these buckets rather than
    optimizing cache or a single shallow pointwise kernel.
  - Prefill output-prep fusion (`RWKV7_NATIVE_PREFILL_FUSED_OUTPUT=1`) is
    correctness-clean but not defaultable on the current 4090 prompt512 rows:
    it reduces the isolated output-prep bucket yet end-to-end bsz=1/4 stays
    below the state-prep-only path.
  - Prefill WAVG LoRA grouping must stay telemetry-only:
    `RWKV7_NATIVE_PREFILL_FUSED_WAVG_LORA=1` improves isolated `B*T=512`
    microbench but regresses end-to-end bsz=1 prefill (`21773.4` tok/s) and is
    disabled for larger flattened rows by default
    (`RWKV7_NATIVE_PREFILL_FUSED_WAVG_LORA_MAX_M=1024`).
  - Deeper R/K/V + W/A/G/V-gate projection fusion is opt-in: current 4090
    decode rows show greedy correctness, bsz=4 speedup, and bsz=1 regression,
    so default promotion is blocked by the min-batch gate. Prefill-shaped
    R/K/V+W/A/G rows are worse (`0.6823x` at bsz=1/T512 and `0.1471x` at
    bsz=4/T512), so do not wire the current two-launch projection prototype
    into prefill.
- Required validation: common functional checklist, bsz=1/2/4/8 decode matrix,
  prefill scan A/B if fast prefill is claimed, quant end-to-end rows, and
  Albatross-ratio reporting.
- Promotion rule: the minimum speedup across claimed bsz values must be >= 1.0x
  with greedy match before enabling a new fusion by default.

#### Hopper / H100 (`sm_90`)

- Policy family: `hopper`.
- Default stance: expected fast server path, but H100 is not tuned until H100 rows
  exist.
- Default-on: `fast_cache`, `fused_recurrent_output`, `fused_output`.
- Default-off: prefill-scan by default, output-project, projection, WAG/WAVG LoRA
  fusions.
- Required validation: common functional checklist, larger model rows, large
  batch/chunked prefill, W8/W4/FP8-like precision and speed rows, PP/TP serving
  smoke if claimed, and ZeRO-2/ZeRO-3 smoke if training is claimed.
- Promotion rule: do not reuse 4090 or Blackwell block sizes without H100 sweeps.

#### Blackwell / RTX 50 / 5070-5090 (`sm_100+`, observed `sm_120`)

- Policy family: `blackwell`.
- Role: next consumer-generation compatibility target.
- Default-on: `fast_cache`, `fused_recurrent_output`, `fused_output`.
- Default-off: `fused_output_project`, projection/LoRA fusions, and prefill-scan
  as a default.
- 50-series adaptation rule:
  - Always include native/no-FLA smokes because FLA kernels may fail or regress on
    new architectures even when inference forward works.
  - Keep projection/LoRA/quant fusions opt-in until exact 50-card end-to-end rows
    prove both correctness and speed. Isolated kernel wins do not promote.
  - Quantization must include footprint, long/short decode speed, and greedy or
    quality rows. Treat bnb as a compatibility/memory baseline, not a fast path.
- Mandatory before claiming support: import/generate, fast decode, dynamic batch,
  chunked prefill, bnb W8/W4 functional inference, native_model no-FLA fallback,
  and exact-card fused-kernel A/B rows.
- Promotion rule: promote only kernels with exact-card greedy match and min bsz
  speedup >= 1.0x; otherwise leave them opt-in/telemetry.

#### AMD / ROCm / HIP

- Policy family: `amd_hip`.
- Default stance: compatibility-first; CUDA/Triton-only kernels are off.
- Default-on: `fast_cache` only.
- Default-off: CUDA native_graph fused kernels and CUDA-only quant speed paths.
- Required path: pure PyTorch/native_model or ROCm-supported fallback first, then
  HIP-specific kernels only after evidence.
- Required validation: ROCm import/generate, pure PyTorch/native_model
  forward/backward, cache smokes, and HIP-specific speed rows before parity
  claims.
- Quant rule: no AMD quant performance claim until HIP-specific W8/W4 rows exist.

### Quantized Inference

Required goals:

- Support 8-bit inference.
- Support 4-bit inference.
- Quantization must reduce memory usage.
- Quantized speed should be no slower than fp16 as much as possible.
- V100 may not be ideal for final int4/int8 speed validation because it lacks
  newer tensor core features.
- Card-validation PRs must report native `mm8`/`mm4` decode tok/s + footprint
  (PR #85/#88), not just bnb W8/W4. bnb is the generic fallback; `mm8`/`mm4`
  (fused Triton dequant-GEMV) is this repo's quant path and the one that must
  be validated per card. If `mm8`/`mm4` cannot run on a card (e.g. Pascal
  sm_61 Triton `.evict_last` limits), record that as the conclusion instead.

## Current State

Completed first-stage HF wrapper adaptation:

- Downloaded official RWKV-7 0.1B checkpoint.
- Verified official `rwkv` package can load and generate on V100.
- Converted 0.1B checkpoint to Hugging Face-style `model.safetensors`.
- Added remote-code wrappers for config/model/tokenizer.
- Verified `AutoTokenizer` loading.
- Verified `AutoModelForCausalLM` loading.
- Verified `generate(use_cache=True)`.
- Verified PEFT LoRA forward/loss/backward smoke test.
- Compared HF logits with official RWKV path:
  - top-5 token IDs match
  - fp16 cosine similarity around `0.999996`
  - max absolute difference around `0.047`

The default production-facing wrapper uses FLA (`flash-linear-attention`) as
backend. The opt-in `RWKV7_NATIVE_MODEL=1` path loads the experimental
pure-PyTorch `NativeRWKV7ForCausalLM` backend for FLA-free compatibility work;
it is not yet the final performance backend.

Recent completed evidence:

- V100 training telemetry is recorded for HF Trainer, TRL SFT, TRL DPO, and TRL
  GRPO-style smoke paths.
- The experimental native/no-FLA backend has explicit HF ecosystem smokes for
  HF Trainer, TRL SFT, TRL DPO, TRL GRPO, PEFT adapter save/load/merge,
  Trainer checkpoint resume, and bnb W8/W4 functional inference. These prove
  compatibility and regression coverage, not Albatross-level speed.
- Albatross A/B ingestion exists and analyzer output reports HF-vs-Albatross
  prefill/decode ratios.
- W8/W4 quantization rows record both canonical memory-target bnb behavior and
  `decode_hot` hybrid variants. The hybrid variants improve decode over generic
  bnb on V100 while remaining below fp16/native-graph speed, so fused/native
  quantized projection kernels remain the main quantization performance gap.

## Engineering Rules

- Do not commit model weights, `.pth`, `.safetensors`, `.bin`, `.gguf`, checkpoints, or generated large artifacts.
- Keep conversion scripts reproducible.
- Keep smoke tests small and runnable on V100.
- Always compare against official RWKV-LM or `rwkv` package outputs when changing math or weight mapping.
- Treat FLA backend as a temporary first-stage dependency until native Transformers implementation is ready.
- Be explicit about state cache behavior: RWKV recurrent state is not Transformer KV cache.
- For PEFT/TRL compatibility, prefer standard HF model signatures and return types.
- For HF serving-style helpers, design state cache allocator/gather/scatter/reorder/release explicitly.

## Next Milestones

1. Convert and validate larger RWKV-7 checkpoints, including the 13.3B gate.
2. Keep official RWKV vs HF logits/generation alignment tests green.
3. Keep `save_pretrained` / reload roundtrip tests green.
4. Expand PEFT / Trainer / TRL SFT/DPO/GRPO smoke tests into multi-batch and gradient-accumulation checks.
5. Move HF performance work into the native fused backend: train_temp-style
   fp16 kernel boundaries, GPU-specific layout/autotune, and DPLR/chunked
   prefill for bsz=1 prompt-prefill. Keep wrapper/cache work to compatibility
   and telemetry fixes.
6. Finish HF quantized W8/W4 inference as memory-compatible first, and claim
   quant speed only after native fused quant kernels beat W16/fp16 end-to-end.
7. Validate on more GPUs and larger batch sizes.
8. Start native Transformers implementation under `src/transformers/models/rwkv7/` style layout.
9. Remove mandatory FLA dependency from the final HF implementation.
