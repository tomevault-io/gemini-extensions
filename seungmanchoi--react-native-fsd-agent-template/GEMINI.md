# AGENTS.md

This file provides Codex guidance for this repository.

## Project Overview

React Native + Expo template with Feature-Sliced Design (FSD) architecture and an AI agent harness for full lifecycle app development.

## Tech Stack

- Framework: React Native 0.81 + Expo 54
- Routing: Expo Router
- State: Zustand for client state, TanStack Query for server state
- Styling: NativeWind
- Forms and validation: React Hook Form + Zod
- API: Axios with token auto-refresh
- TypeScript: strict mode

## Codex Harness Rules

This repository includes Claude-era harness files under `.claude/`. Codex does not execute Claude agents, Claude settings, or Claude permission files as native runtime features. Treat those files as project reference documents only.

When a task maps to a harness role, read the relevant `.claude/agents/*.md` file before implementation and apply the domain rules manually:

| Task Type | Reference |
| --- | --- |
| Idea and market research | `.claude/agents/idea-researcher.md` |
| Product planning and PRD | `.claude/agents/product-planner.md` |
| Specs and task breakdown | `.claude/agents/spec-planner.md` |
| Design system and theme | `.claude/agents/design-architect.md` |
| FSD module scaffolding | `.claude/agents/feature-builder.md` |
| API and state integration | `.claude/agents/api-integrator.md` |
| UI and screens | `.claude/agents/ui-developer.md` |
| Code quality review | `.claude/agents/qa-reviewer.md` |
| Functional and UX inspection | `.claude/agents/app-inspector.md` |

Use Codex skills when they are available for the same workflow:

| Workflow | Codex Skill |
| --- | --- |
| App ideation | `ideate` |
| App planning | `plan-app` |
| Design system | `design-system` |
| FSD feature creation | `create-feature` |
| Entity creation | `create-entity` |
| Screen creation | `create-screen` |
| App inspection | `inspect-app` |
| Full lifecycle app development | `orchestrate` |
| Store deployment | `store-deploy` |

For full app development, follow this pipeline and do not skip QA:

1. Ideation
2. Product planning (must define KPIs — north-star metric + acquisition/activation/retention/monetization)
3. Spec planning and task breakdown
4. Design
5. Implementation
   - 5a feature scaffolding
   - 5b API integration
   - 5c UI screens
   - 5d Firebase Analytics + Crashlytics integration (KPI events from PRD)
6. QA and app inspection
7. Iteration, up to 3 fix loops
8. Deployment through `store-deploy`

Use `_workspace/` for handoff artifacts between phases. Before moving to a later phase, read the previous phase outputs from `_workspace/` and continue from them.

## Hard Thresholds

These are fail conditions:

| Check | Threshold |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run typecheck` errors | 0 |
| `npm run lint` errors | 0 |
| `any` types in production code | 0 |
| FSD layer dependency violations | 0 |
| Missing safe area handling in screens | 0 |
| Missing barrel exports | 0 |
| Broken NativeWind setup | 0 |
| `toISOString().split('T')[0]` for local date | 0 |
| Tokens or secrets stored in AsyncStorage/MMKV/plaintext | 0 |
| `requestReview()` calls bypassing the policy engine | 0 |

### Secure Storage And Sensitive Data

`AsyncStorage` and `MMKV` write to plaintext stores that are readable on rooted/jailbroken devices. Auth tokens and any other sensitive data must live in iOS Keychain / Android Keystore-backed encrypted storage. Use `expo-secure-store` as the standard.

Install:

```bash
npx expo install expo-secure-store
```

Storage boundary:

| Class | Examples | Storage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sensitive | access token, refresh token, OAuth/session tokens, API secret keys, payment tokens, passwords/PINs, premium license keys, PII-bound tokens | `expo-secure-store` |
| Semi-sensitive | push tokens, device secrets, recoverable user pseudo-IDs | `expo-secure-store` |
| Non-sensitive | UI theme, locale, last-visited screen, onboarding flags, non-identifying cache, non-sensitive Zustand slices | `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` or `react-native-mmkv` |

Forbidden:

- Persisting tokens through Redux/Zustand `persist` into `AsyncStorage`. `persist` is only for non-sensitive slices.
- Putting secrets in `app.config.ts` `extra`, `.env` files shipped to the client bundle, or plaintext JSON.
- Logging tokens or PII to console, Crashlytics, or Analytics params — mask even in `__DEV__`.

FSD layout:

```text
src/shared/secure-storage/
├── client.ts        # expo-secure-store wrapper
├── keys.ts          # SECURE_KEYS constants + TSecureKey
├── types/index.ts
└── index.ts         # barrel export
```

Required wrapper pattern (`src/shared/secure-storage/client.ts`):

```ts
import * as SecureStore from 'expo-secure-store';
import { SECURE_KEYS, TSecureKey } from './keys';

const DEFAULT_OPTIONS: SecureStore.SecureStoreOptions = {
  keychainAccessible: SecureStore.WHEN_UNLOCKED_THIS_DEVICE_ONLY,
};

export const setSecureItem = (key: TSecureKey, value: string) =>
  SecureStore.setItemAsync(key, value, DEFAULT_OPTIONS);

export const getSecureItem = (key: TSecureKey) =>
  SecureStore.getItemAsync(key, DEFAULT_OPTIONS);

export const deleteSecureItem = (key: TSecureKey) =>
  SecureStore.deleteItemAsync(key, DEFAULT_OPTIONS);

export const clearAllSecure = () =>
  Promise.all(Object.values(SECURE_KEYS).map(deleteSecureItem));
```

Keys catalog (`src/shared/secure-storage/keys.ts`):

```ts
export const SECURE_KEYS = {
  ACCESS_TOKEN: 'auth.access_token',
  REFRESH_TOKEN: 'auth.refresh_token',
  BIOMETRIC_ENABLED: 'auth.biometric_enabled',
} as const;

export type TSecureKey = (typeof SECURE_KEYS)[keyof typeof SECURE_KEYS];
```

Integration rules:

- Token state in `features/auth/store/` lives in memory. Its persist adapter must be a `SecureStore`-backed custom storage passed to Zustand `persist` via `createJSONStorage`.
- Axios interceptor in `src/shared/api/client.ts` reads tokens from memory or `SecureStore`. Never from `AsyncStorage`.
- On logout or token expiry, call `clearAllSecure()` to wipe every secret key.
- Default iOS option: `WHEN_UNLOCKED_THIS_DEVICE_ONLY` — excludes iCloud/local backups.
- Android: `expo-secure-store` uses Keystore-backed `EncryptedSharedPreferences` automatically. No extra wiring required.

Biometric gating (optional, for high-risk tokens like payment, health, financial):

```ts
await SecureStore.setItemAsync(key, value, {
  keychainAccessible: SecureStore.WHEN_PASSCODE_SET_THIS_DEVICE_ONLY,
  requireAuthentication: true,
  authenticationPrompt: 'Authenticate to continue',
});
```

Hard thresholds for Secure Storage:

| Check | Threshold |
| --- | --- |
| Tokens/secrets stored in `AsyncStorage`/`MMKV`/`localStorage`/plaintext | 0 |
| Code touching tokens outside `@/shared/secure-storage` wrapper | 0 |
| Zustand `persist` writing a token slice to `AsyncStorage` | 0 |
| Tokens or PII appearing in `console.log`, Crashlytics, or Analytics params | 0 |
| Client-side secrets in `app.config.ts` `extra` or `.env` | 0 |

### Date and Time Handling

Use `dayjs` for all date and time operations. `dayjs()` returns device local time, which is correct for user-facing dates. Never use `new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0]` as a local date — it returns UTC, which is wrong in UTC+N timezones between midnight and the offset hours.

| Use case | Correct | Forbidden |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Today (YYYY-MM-DD) | `dayjs().format('YYYY-MM-DD')` | `new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0]` |
| N days ago | `dayjs().subtract(N, 'day').format('YYYY-MM-DD')` | Manual Date arithmetic |
| Current hour | `dayjs().hour()` | `new Date().getUTCHours()` |
| Timestamp storage | `new Date().toISOString()` | Local time strings |

Store dates in Zustand as `YYYY-MM-DD` strings or ISO timestamps. Never persist `Date` objects.

After implementation changes, run:

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
```

Run formatting when code style changes:

```bash
npm run format
```

## iOS Simulator Runbook

This app uses native modules and cannot run in Expo Go:

- `@shopify/react-native-skia`
- `react-native-google-mobile-ads`
- `expo-face-detector`

Use a development build through Expo:

```bash
npx expo run:ios --port 8083
```

Before running iOS:

```bash
node -v
```

Use Node 22.x. Node 24 can crash Expo CLI with `ERR_SOCKET_BAD_PORT`. If needed:

```bash
nvm use 22
```

Check Metro port conflicts:

```bash
lsof -i :8081 | grep LISTEN
```

If 8081 is busy, keep using `--port 8083`.

Check the booted simulator:

```bash
xcrun simctl list devices booted
```

If no simulator is booted, boot an available simulator:

```bash
xcrun simctl boot "iPhone 16 Pro"
```

The `npx expo run:ios --port 8083` command runs prebuild, CocoaPods install, native build, simulator install, and Metro startup.

### iOS Troubleshooting

If the app builds as `x86_64` and fails to install on an arm64 simulator, inspect `ios/Podfile` and generated Pod xcconfig files for `EXCLUDED_ARCHS[sdk=iphonesimulator*] = arm64`. Remove the arm64 simulator exclusion when the pods support arm64 simulator builds, then run:

```bash
cd ios
pod install
cd ..
npx expo run:ios --port 8083
```

If MLKit pods from `expo-face-detector` block simulator builds, investigate whether `expo-face-detector` is required for the current run. Do not remove the feature permanently without confirming product impact.

If `RNGoogleMobileAdsModule not found` appears, the app was likely opened in Expo Go. Use `npx expo run:ios` instead.

For a running simulator screenshot:

```bash
xcrun simctl io booted screenshot /tmp/screenshot.png
```

For static checks without building:

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
```

## ESLint 9 And FlashList v2

- Use ESLint 9 flat config in `eslint.config.js`.
- Do not use `--ext` in the lint script.
- Do not add `estimatedItemSize` to FlashList v2 unless the installed type definitions require it.
- Exclude `_workspace/`, `.claude/`, and `plugins/` from lint and typecheck when they are not production source.

## NativeWind Required Setup

NativeWind requires all of these files to stay aligned:

| File | Required Setting |
| --- | --- |
| `babel.config.js` | `babel-preset-expo` with `jsxImportSource: 'nativewind'`, plus `nativewind/babel` |
| `metro.config.js` | `withNativeWind(config, { input: './global.css' })` |
| `tailwind.config.js` | `presets: [require('nativewind/preset')]`, content paths for `app/` and `src/` |
| `global.css` | Tailwind base, components, utilities imports |
| Root `_layout.tsx` | `import '../global.css';` |
| `nativewind-env.d.ts` | `/// <reference types="nativewind/types" />` |

## Architecture

Use Feature-Sliced Design:

```text
src/
├── core/
├── features/
├── entities/
├── widgets/
└── shared/
    ├── api/
    ├── config/
    ├── lib/
    ├── types/
    └── ui/
```

Dependency direction:

```text
app -> widgets -> features -> entities -> shared
```

Upper layers may reference lower layers only. Lower layers must not import from upper layers.

Feature structure:

```text
features/{name}/
├── api/
├── hooks/
├── store/
├── types/
├── ui/
└── index.ts
```

## Code Conventions

- Do not use `any` in production code.
- Use safe area handling on all screens.
- Prefix interfaces with `I`, type aliases with `T`, and enums with `E`.
- Keep interfaces, types, and enums in separate files when they are shared.
- Use the `@/` alias for app imports.
- Keep public imports behind barrel exports where the local module pattern expects it.

## Analytics And Key Metrics

Every app must collect measurable KPIs from launch. Firebase is the standard.

Required packages:

- `@react-native-firebase/app`
- `@react-native-firebase/analytics`
- `@react-native-firebase/crashlytics`
- `@react-native-firebase/remote-config` (optional)

Standard KPI axes (define all four in the PRD, plus one north-star metric):

| Axis | Examples | Firebase event |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Acquisition | new installs, first open | `first_open` (auto), `app_install` |
| Activation | DAU/WAU, first key action | custom `activation`, `screen_view` (auto) |
| Retention | D1/D7/D30, session length | `session_start`, `user_engagement` (auto) |
| Monetization | ad impressions, IAP revenue, ARPU | `ad_impression` (auto), `purchase` |

Event naming:

- snake_case, verb_noun (`tap_camera_capture`, `view_gallery_grid`)
- Do not reuse Firebase reserved auto-event names.
- Max 25 params per event. Key length ≤ 40, value length ≤ 100.
- Never log PII (email, phone, real name, precise location).

Code layout under FSD:

```text
src/shared/analytics/
├── client.ts           # firebase analytics wrapper — logEvent, setUserProperty
├── events.ts           # event catalog (constants + param types)
├── hooks/
│   └── useScreenTracking.ts
├── types/index.ts
└── index.ts            # barrel export
```

Rules:

- Never call `firebase.analytics()` or `logEvent` directly outside `@/shared/analytics`.
- Define every event name as a constant in `events.ts`. No magic strings.
- Disable collection in dev: gate with `env.IS_PROD`.
- Do not commit `GoogleService-Info.plist` or `google-services.json`. Inject via EAS Secrets and `eas.json` env.

Integration order:

1. **Create Firebase project and apps via Playwright MCP** (browser automation on https://console.firebase.google.com, same pattern as AdMob console setup). Firebase REST APIs for app provisioning are not available to standard OAuth scopes, so the console UI is the authoritative channel.
   - Navigate to the Firebase console with `mcp__playwright__browser_navigate`.
   - If not signed in, ask the user to sign in directly in the opened browser window. Resume automation after sign-in.
   - Create a new project (`{app-slug}-prod`) or pick an existing one. Enable Google Analytics during creation.
   - Add iOS app: bundle ID from `app.config.ts` `ios.bundleIdentifier`. Click "Register app". Click "Download GoogleService-Info.plist". Skip the SDK/console steps.
   - Add Android app: package name from `app.config.ts` `android.package`. Leave SHA-1 blank for now. Click "Register app". Click "Download google-services.json". Skip the SDK/console steps.
   - Move downloaded files:
     - `~/Downloads/GoogleService-Info.plist` → `ios/GoogleService-Info.plist`
     - `~/Downloads/google-services.json` → `android/app/google-services.json`
   - If `ios/` or `android/` does not yet exist (pre-prebuild), park files in `firebase/` and re-place after `expo prebuild --clean`.
   - If the Firebase console UI changes and selectors break, stop automation, ask the user to register both apps manually and download the files, then resume from the move step.
2. **Place config files locally and protect them**.
   - Add to `.gitignore`: `ios/GoogleService-Info.plist`, `android/app/google-services.json`, `firebase/`.
   - Upload as EAS Secrets so cloud builds receive them:
     ```bash
     eas secret:create --scope project --name GOOGLE_SERVICES_PLIST --type file --value ./ios/GoogleService-Info.plist
     eas secret:create --scope project --name GOOGLE_SERVICES_JSON  --type file --value ./android/app/google-services.json
     ```
   - Reference them in `app.config.ts` via `ios.googleServicesFile` / `android.googleServicesFile`.
3. Install packages and register plugins:
   ```bash
   npm install @react-native-firebase/app @react-native-firebase/analytics @react-native-firebase/crashlytics
   npx expo install expo-build-properties
   ```
   Add to `app.config.ts` `plugins`:
   ```ts
   '@react-native-firebase/app',
   '@react-native-firebase/crashlytics',
   ['expo-build-properties', { ios: { useFrameworks: 'static' } }],
   ```
4. Implement `src/shared/analytics/` wrapper, catalog, and screen tracking hook.
5. Initialize Analytics and Crashlytics in root `_layout.tsx` with collection gated on `env.IS_PROD`.
6. Wire events to the KPI map from the PRD.
7. Verify: `expo prebuild --clean`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, then a local EAS build. Confirm `[Firebase/Analytics]` initialization appears in the device log.

Hard thresholds for Analytics:

| Check | Threshold |
| --- | --- |
| PRD missing KPI section (north-star + 4 axes) | 0 |
| Direct `firebase.analytics()` calls outside `@/shared/analytics` | 0 |
| `logEvent` called with magic strings (no constant in `events.ts`) | 0 |
| Event params containing PII | 0 |
| Committed `GoogleService-Info.plist` or `google-services.json` | 0 |

## In-App Store Review Prompts

Ratings should fire at the moment users feel value, not at first launch. Bad timing produces 1-star reviews. All review prompts go through a single policy engine — no direct calls from screens.

Standard stack:

- `expo-store-review` (wraps iOS `SKStoreReviewController` and Android Play In-App Review API)
- Non-sensitive counters persisted via AsyncStorage or MMKV (no SecureStore needed)

Install:

```bash
npx expo install expo-store-review
```

Platform limits to know:

- iOS displays at most 3 prompts per app per 365 days. The system decides actual display, not the developer.
- Android Play In-App Review also has its own quota and silently throttles.
- Calling the API is free, but burning quota means losing meaningful opportunities. Use the policy engine to call rarely.

Trigger policy (all gates must pass before `requestReview()` runs):

| Gate | Default | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Days since install | ≥ 3 | Never ask brand-new users |
| Launch count | ≥ 5 | User has actually returned |
| Key-action completions | ≥ 3 | Repeated value, not one-time activation |
| Days since last request | ≥ 90 | Protect iOS system quota |
| Already asked this session | false | One per session |
| Error/crash in last 5 min | false | Block negative context |

Anti-patterns (immediate FAIL):

- Prompting during onboarding or first launch
- Prompting after payment failures, network errors, or permission denials
- Stacking the prompt over an existing modal
- UI copy that suggests a star count (e.g. "please give 5 stars") — violates App Store guidelines
- Dark patterns that gate features behind ratings
- Calling `StoreReview.requestReview()` from anywhere except the policy-engine hook

FSD layout:

```text
src/shared/store-review/
├── client.ts          # expo-store-review wrapper
├── policy.ts          # canRequestReview gate engine
├── store.ts           # Zustand persist — counters and timestamps
├── triggers.ts        # REVIEW_TRIGGERS constants
├── hooks/
│   └── useStoreReview.ts  # maybeRequest(triggerId)
├── types/index.ts
└── index.ts
```

Trigger catalog (`triggers.ts`):

```ts
export const REVIEW_TRIGGERS = {
  AFTER_PHOTO_SAVE: 'after_photo_save',
  AFTER_TASK_COMPLETE: 'after_task_complete',
  AFTER_PREMIUM_UNLOCK: 'after_premium_unlock',
} as const;

export type TReviewTrigger = (typeof REVIEW_TRIGGERS)[keyof typeof REVIEW_TRIGGERS];
```

Hook contract (`useStoreReview.ts`):

```ts
import * as StoreReview from 'expo-store-review';
import { logEvent } from '@/shared/analytics';
import { useReviewStore } from '../store';
import { canRequestReview } from '../policy';
import type { TReviewTrigger } from '../triggers';

export const useStoreReview = () => {
  const state = useReviewStore();
  return {
    maybeRequest: async (trigger: TReviewTrigger) => {
      if (!(await StoreReview.isAvailableAsync())) return false;
      if (!canRequestReview(state)) return false;
      state.markRequested();
      await logEvent('request_store_review', { trigger });
      await StoreReview.requestReview();
      return true;
    },
  };
};
```

Call rules:

- Code outside `@/shared/store-review` never calls `expo-store-review` directly.
- Trigger IDs come only from `REVIEW_TRIGGERS`. No magic strings.
- Every prompt logs `request_store_review` to Firebase Analytics with the trigger param.
- Call from the success callback of a positive action, after the UI is idle (toast dismissed, navigation settled).
- Never call from `onError`, `catch`, or boundary handlers.

Automatic counters:

- Root `_layout.tsx` calls `reviewStore.recordLaunch()` on app start.
- A global error boundary / Crashlytics handler calls `reviewStore.recordError()`.
- `recordKeyAction()` is invoked from screen success callbacks by ui-developer.

Hard thresholds for store review:

| Check | Threshold |
| --- | --- |
| Direct `expo-store-review` calls outside the wrapper | 0 |
| `requestReview()` calls that bypass `canRequestReview` | 0 |
| Magic-string trigger IDs (not from `REVIEW_TRIGGERS`) | 0 |
| Review prompts inside error/crash handlers | 0 |
| Review prompts during onboarding, first launch, or after failure | 0 |
| UI copy that suggests a star count | 0 |

Agent responsibilities:

- product-planner: lists candidate review triggers in the PRD with thresholds.
- api-integrator: builds the `src/shared/store-review/` module (wrapper, policy, store, triggers, hook).
- ui-developer: wires `useStoreReview().maybeRequest(...)` and `recordKeyAction()` into screen success callbacks.
- qa-reviewer: enforces anti-patterns and hard thresholds.

## Build And Store Deployment

Use `store-deploy` for store deployment work. Do not use unrelated deployment tooling unless the user explicitly changes this rule.

For production builds:

1. Run a local EAS build first.
2. If local build succeeds, run the cloud EAS build.
3. If cloud credits are unavailable, use the local artifact where appropriate.

Keep `.easignore` configured to exclude unnecessary build archive content such as `node_modules/`, screenshots, generated store assets, docs, scripts, build outputs, Git metadata, IDE metadata, and TypeScript build info.

Store app names and home screen names must match by locale:

- `app.config.ts` `name`
- `app.config.ts` `withLocalizedAppName` plugin values
- `fastlane/metadata/ios/{lang}/name.txt`
- `fastlane/metadata/android/{lang}/title.txt`

Android changelogs must stay within 500 bytes. iOS release notes can be longer, but prefer the Android-safe copy when sharing metadata across stores.

For global store deployment key paths, AdMob setup, package ID rules, localized app names, privacy/support pages, Fastlane conventions, and commit message rules, follow the migrated global Codex rules in:

```text
/Users/seungmanchoi/.codex/global-claude-rules.md
```

## Branch Strategy

```text
main       <- production
devel      <- development
feature/*  <- feature work
```

## Common Commands

```bash
npm install
npm start
npm run ios
npm run android
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run format
```
