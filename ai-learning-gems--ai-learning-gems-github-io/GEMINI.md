# Quarto Conventions

Shared Quarto formatting and structure rules for all textbook chapter workflows.

---

## Folder-Based Structure

Because IDE agents rewrite files from scratch on each edit, a single-file approach causes the entire chapter to be rewritten when editing any section. Instead, use a **folder-based structure** where:
- Each section is a separate file (can be edited independently)
- An index file includes all sections (renders as a single document)

### File Structure

```
Statistics/
├── Bayesian Credible Intervals.qmd          ← Index file (includes all sections)
└── Bayesian Credible Intervals/             ← Folder (same name as index)
    ├── TEXTBOOK-PLAN.md                     ← Created by the research workflow
    ├── _01-introduction.qmd                 ← Section 1
    ├── _02-the-bayesian-framework.qmd       ← Section 2
    ├── _03-computing-credible-intervals.qmd ← Section 3
    ├── _04-examples.qmd                     ← Section 4
    ├── _98-math-background.qmd              ← Math Background appendix (if needed)
    ├── _99-closing.qmd                      ← Summary, questions, resources
    └── sources/                             ← Symlink or note pointing to AI-Learning-Gems/sources/
```

**Key conventions:**
- **Index file:** `[Topic Name].qmd` — contains YAML header and `{{< include >}}` statements
- **Folder:** `[Topic Name]/` — same name as the index file (without `.qmd`)
- **Section files:** Prefixed with `_` so Quarto doesn't render them standalone
- **Numeric prefixes:** `_01-`, `_02-`, etc. for ordering (starting at `_01`, not `_00`)
- **Sources:** Referenced from central `AI-Learning-Gems/sources/` — see TEXTBOOK-PLAN.md for paths

---

## Index File Template

The index file should contain ONLY the YAML header and include statements. Most settings (format, jupyter kernel, execute options) are inherited from the project's `_quarto.yml` file — the index file only needs the title and the D2 diagram filter.

**CRITICAL:** The filter path is RELATIVE from the `.qmd` file to the `_extensions` folder at the project root. Adjust the number of `../` based on folder depth:
- Files 1 level deep (e.g., `Statistics/Topic.qmd`): `../_extensions/...`
- Files 2 levels deep (e.g., `Statistics/Subfolder/Topic.qmd`): `../../_extensions/...`

Example:

```yaml
---
title: "Bayesian Credible Intervals"
filters:
  - ../_extensions/pandoc-ext/diagram/diagram.lua
---
```

```markdown
{{< include "Bayesian Credible Intervals/_01-introduction.qmd" >}}

{{< include "Bayesian Credible Intervals/_02-the-bayesian-framework.qmd" >}}

{{< include "Bayesian Credible Intervals/_03-computing-credible-intervals.qmd" >}}

{{< include "Bayesian Credible Intervals/_04-examples.qmd" >}}

{{< include "Bayesian Credible Intervals/_99-closing.qmd" >}}
```

**CRITICAL:** The `{{< include >}}` shortcode must be:
- On its own line
- With blank lines above and below
- Path is relative to the index file location
- **ALWAYS quote the path** (wrap in `"..."`) — Quarto splits on spaces, so unquoted paths like `Vision Transformers/file.qmd` will fail with "could not find file" errors

---

## Section File Template

Each section file should NOT have a YAML header (it inherits from the index file). Start directly with the section heading:

```markdown
## Introduction {#sec-introduction}

Content goes here...

### Subsection A

### Subsection B
```

**CRITICAL — heading levels:** Each section file must have exactly **ONE `##` heading** (the section's main heading). All sub-parts within the file must use `###` or lower (`####`, etc.). This is because Quarto counts all `##` headings sequentially across `{{< include >}}`'d files — if a section file has 5 `##` headings, it consumes 5 section numbers, throwing off the numbering for every subsequent section.

**Do NOT use `.unnumbered` on any section heading.** All sections (introduction, body, closing) should be numbered. The `number-sections: true` setting in `_quarto.yml` handles this globally. Using `.unnumbered` causes subsections to render as 0.1, 0.2, etc., which looks broken.

---

## Per-Section Source Headers (Collapsible)

**Each section should include its own sources** as a collapsible header at the top. This keeps sources close to the content they support.

**CRITICAL: The section heading (`##`) MUST come FIRST, then the sources callout inside it.** If the callout is placed *above* the heading, it renders as belonging to the previous section.

```markdown
## Section Title {#sec-section-name}

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" title="Sources for this section"}

| # | Source | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | [ViT Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929) | Original ViT equations |
| 2 | [D2L ViT](https://d2l.ai/chapter_attention/vision-transformer.html) | Implementation details |

:::

[Section content...]
```

**CRITICAL — Attribution for Blog Content:**

Many sources in this project come from independent researchers' blogs (see `high-quality-blogs.md`). These are original intellectual contributions that MUST be attributed:

- **Source header**: Always list blog posts in the section source table with the author's name: `[Lilian Weng — "Reward Hacking in RL"](URL)`
- **Figures**: When using images from blog posts, always caption with: `Source: [Author Name], "[Post Title]" ([year]).`
- **Explanations and framings**: When your explanation is adapted from or inspired by a blog post's framing, say so in the text: *"The following derivation follows Gundersen's treatment in [post title]"* or *"As Olah explains in [post title], ..."*
- **Never present blog content as original**: If a worked example, analogy, or visual explanation comes from a blog, credit it explicitly

---

## LaTeX Formatting (Quarto-Compatible)

**Inline equations:** `$equation$`

**Block equations:**
```
$$
equation
$$
```

**Numbered equations:**
```
$$
equation
$$ {#eq-label}
```

### Common LaTeX Mistakes to Avoid

- Use `$...$` for inline math — NOT parentheses `(\theta)`, NOT `\(...\)`
- Use `$$...$$` for block math — each on its own line
- Do NOT escape `^` or `_` inside LaTeX — write `$x^2$` not `$x\^2$`
- Ensure `^` and `_` are directly attached to their base: `$x^2$` not `$x ^2$`

### For Each Significant Equation

1. Show the equation
2. Explain what each symbol means in plain language
3. Provide a concrete numerical example
4. Show a visualization of what the equation represents

---

## Markdown Formatting

### Lists

**Bullet points:**
- Use hyphens (`-`) for bullet points, NOT asterisks (`*`)
- Each bullet point MUST start on its own line
- Use exactly ONE space after the hyphen: `- Item` (not `-   Item` or `-Item`)
- Add a blank line BEFORE the first bullet point

**Numbered lists:**
- Each numbered item MUST start on its own line
- Use `1.` format with exactly ONE space after: `1. Item`
- Add a blank line BEFORE the first numbered item

**Nested lists:**
- Use 2-space or 4-space indentation for sub-items
- Each sub-item on its own line

### Horizontal Rules

**WRONG:** `------------------------------------------------------------------------`
**CORRECT:** `---`

### Table Formatting

- Do NOT escape `#` in tables — write `#` not `\#`
- Column separator dashes should be short: `|---|` not `|---------------|`
- Header row and separator row must match column count
- Add blank line before and after tables

## Cross-References

```markdown
See @sec-introduction for background.
As shown in @fig-gradient-descent, the function...
From @eq-loss-function, we can derive...
```

**Section labels:**
```markdown
## Introduction {#sec-introduction}
```

**Equation labels:**
```markdown
$$
L(\theta) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2
$$ {#eq-loss-function}
```

**Collapsible callouts:**
```markdown
::: {.callout-note collapse="true" title="Sources for this section"}
| # | Source | Summary |
|---|---|---|
:::
```
