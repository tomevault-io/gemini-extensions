# Rails Agent Skills — Gemini CLI Context

This plugin provides a library of specialized Rails development skills. When a task arrives, check if any skill applies and read it before responding.

## CROSS-CUTTING MANDATE: Tests Gate Implementation

```text
THIS IS NON-NEGOTIABLE AND APPLIES TO EVERY SKILL THAT PRODUCES CODE.

WORKFLOW: PRD → TASKS → TESTS → IMPLEMENTATION → YARD → DOCS → CODE REVIEW → PR

Tests are a GATE. Implementation code CANNOT be written until:
1. The test EXISTS
2. The test has been RUN
3. The test FAILS for the right reason (feature missing, not a typo)
```

Wrote implementation code before the test? Delete it. Start over. No exceptions.

## Primary Workflow: TDD Feature Loop

For Gemini CLI, **workflow chaining is the primary mechanism**. Skills are building blocks — workflows are the story. The most common daily workflow:

```text
rails-tdd-slices → write failing test
  → [CHECKPOINT: Test Feedback — confirm behavior, boundary, edge cases]
  → [CHECKPOINT: Implementation Proposal — confirm approach before coding]
  → implement (minimal code to pass test) → refactor
  → [GATE: Linters + Full Test Suite]
  → yard-documentation
  → rails-code-review (self-review)
  → rails-review-response (when feedback is received)
  → re-review if Critical findings were addressed
  → PR
```

See [docs/workflow-guide.md](docs/workflow-guide.md) for all workflow diagrams.

## Skill Priority

1. **TDD always** — `rspec-best-practices` applies whenever code is produced
2. **Planning first** — `create-prd`, `generate-tasks` (optionally `ticket-planning`)
3. **Domain discovery next** — `ddd-*` skills when domain is the hard part
4. **Process skills** — `refactor-safely`
5. **Domain skills** — `rails-*`, `ruby-*` for specific implementation

## Typical Workflows

**TDD Feature Loop** *(primary)*:
`rails-tdd-slices` → **[Test Feedback checkpoint]** → **[Implementation Proposal checkpoint]** → implement → **[Linters + Suite gate]** → `yard-documentation` → `rails-code-review` → `rails-review-response` (on feedback) → PR

**New feature:**
`create-prd` → `generate-tasks` → *TDD Feature Loop*

**DDD-first:**
`create-prd` → `ddd-ubiquitous-language` → `ddd-boundaries-review` → `ddd-rails-modeling` → `generate-tasks` → *TDD Feature Loop*

**Code review + response:**
`rails-code-review` → `rails-review-response` (on feedback) → re-review if Critical items addressed

**Bug fix:**
`rails-bug-triage` → `rails-tdd-slices` → **[GATE: failing reproduction spec]** → fix → verify test passes

**GraphQL feature:**
`ddd-ubiquitous-language` → `rails-graphql-best-practices` → *TDD Feature Loop* → `rails-security-review`

**New engine:**
`rails-engines-flow` (or atomic: `rails-engine-author` → **[GATE: engine specs]** → implement → `rails-engine-docs`)

**Project setup:**
`rails-setup-flow` (context → onboarding → CI/CD)

**Quality before PR:**
`rails-quality-flow` (conventions → refactor → docs)

**Refactoring:**
`refactor-safely` → **[GATE: characterization tests pass]** → refactor → verify tests still pass

## Code Quality Defaults

These apply to ALL generated Ruby/Rails code regardless of which skill is active:

**Service response format:** Always return `{ success: bool, response: { ... } }` — data under `response:`, errors under `response: { error: { message: '...' } }`.

**Ruby files:** Every `.rb` file begins with `# frozen_string_literal: true`.

**Error logging:** Every `rescue StandardError` block MUST log message AND backtrace: `Rails.logger.error(e.message)` and `Rails.logger.error(e.backtrace.first(5).join("\n"))`.

**YARD @raise:** Add one `@raise` tag per exception class for every public method that can raise — even internally rescued exceptions.

**RSpec time tests:** Time-dependent behavior MUST use `travel_to` — never stub `Time.now` or set dates in the past.

**Background jobs:** Always include `retry_on ExceptionClass, wait: :polynomially_longer, attempts: N` for transient errors and `discard_on` for permanent errors (e.g. `ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound`).

**Task lists (generate-tasks):** Task 0.0 ALWAYS creates the feature branch. Each implementation task MUST have four sub-tasks: (a) write spec, (b) run spec — verify fails, (c) implement, (d) run spec — verify passes. Always include a Relevant Files section.

## Output Language

Generated artifacts (YARD docs, Postman collections, READMEs, task descriptions) must be in **English** unless the user explicitly requests another language.

## Eval Strategy

Skills are scored on two axes: **skill-specific criteria** AND **model performance baseline-vs-with-context**. A skill that only beats baseline marginally is under-specified — it should change the model's output meaningfully. See [docs/skill-optimization-guide.md](docs/skill-optimization-guide.md) for the optimization loop and per-skill targets.
