# Neuro Karaoke Project Overview

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Neuro Karaoke Android application, including its structure, key technologies, and instructions on how to build and run the app.

## High-Level Description

The Neuro Karaoke app is a music player application that allows users to browse and play karaoke songs from the Neuro Karaoke website (neurokaraoke.com). It features a modern user interface built with Jetpack Compose and uses ExoPlayer (Media3) for audio playback with media notification support. The app connects to the Neuro Karaoke API to fetch playlists and songs.

### 4. Lyrics (NeuroKaraoke API + lrclib.net fallback)
- **Primary:** Fetches synced lyrics from NeuroKaraoke API (`GET /api/songs/{songId}/lyrics`)
  - Song ID lookup via `audioUrl` → `absolutePath` matching against setlist data
  - Lazy-built map of ~1264 songs cached in `NeuroKaraokeApi.songIdMap`
  - TimeSpan format (`HH:mm:ss.fffffff`) parsed into milliseconds
- **Fallback:** lrclib.net API when NeuroKaraoke lyrics unavailable
- Auto-scrolls to current lyric line during playback
- Falls back to plain lyrics if synced not available
- Lyrics cached locally with source tracking (`"neurokaraoke"` or `"lrclib"`)
- Credit text shows source: "Lyrics provided by NeuroKaraoke" or "Lyrics provided by LRCLIB"

### 5. Audio Caching (Spotify-like)

- Artist images from Last.fm CDN via `ArtistImageRepository`

### 13. Artist Images
- `ArtistImageRepository.kt` maps artist names to Last.fm image URLs
- Falls back to song cover art if no artist image found
- **Verified working images:** Pinocchio-P, DECO*27, Kanaria, wowaka, Hachi, livetune, Eve, Maretu, Kikuo, Mitchie M, Reol, supercell, Ado
- **To add more artists:** Add entries to the `artistImages` map:
  ```kotlin
  "artist name" to "https://lastfm.freetls.fastly.net/i/u/300x300/[image_hash].jpg"
  ```
- Find image hashes by visiting `https://www.last.fm/music/[ArtistName]` and inspecting the profile image URL

### 14. Playback State Persistence
- Remembers last played song and position across app restarts
- **Save points (3 independent locations for reliability):**
  - `Activity.onStop()` — saves when app goes to background
  - `MediaPlaybackService.onTaskRemoved()` — saves from service when app swiped from recents
  - `PlayerViewModel` — saves on `playSong()`, play/pause, song transitions, every 30s during playback, and `onCleared()`
- **Restore:** Runs immediately in `PlayerViewModel.init()` (before MediaController connects)
  - Mini player shows correct song instantly on app launch
  - Progress bar reflects saved position
- **Queue fallback on resume:** If restored song isn't in current queue, tries `allSongs`, then single-item queue
- SharedPreferences file: `"playback_state"` with keys: `last_song_id`, `last_song_title`, `last_song_artist`, `last_song_cover_url`, `last_song_audio_url`, `last_song_singer`, `last_playlist_id`, `last_position`, `last_duration`

### 10. Discord Sign-in (Prepared)
- Discord OAuth2 flow set up
- Sign-in button in navigation drawer
- User profile display when logged in
- Note: Backend integration needed to complete OAuth token exchange

### 11. Favorites (Prepared)
- Shows sign-in prompt for non-authenticated users
- Ready to display favorites when synced from server
- Heart icon on player (needs backend integration)

## Stats

## Building and Running the App

1.  Open the project in Android Studio.
2.  Connect a device or start an emulator.
3.  Click the "Run" button in the toolbar.

## Key Files for Common Tasks

- **Playback control:** `viewmodel/PlayerViewModel.kt`
- **Media service:** `service/MediaPlaybackService.kt`
- **Audio caching:** `audio/AudioCacheManager.kt`
- **Equalizer:** `audio/EqualizerManager.kt`
- **Lyrics:** `data/api/LyricsApi.kt`
- **API calls:** `data/api/NeuroKaraokeApi.kt`
- **Authentication:** `data/repository/AuthRepository.kt`, `viewmodel/AuthViewModel.kt`
- **User playlists:** `data/repository/UserPlaylistRepository.kt`
- **Add to playlist sheet:** `ui/components/AddToPlaylistSheet.kt`
- **User playlist detail:** `ui/screens/library/UserPlaylistDetailScreen.kt`
- **Setlist grid:** `ui/screens/setlist/SetlistScreen.kt`
- **Setlist detail:** `ui/screens/setlist/SetlistDetailScreen.kt`

## TODO / Pending Work

1. **Discord OAuth Backend Integration:** The OAuth flow opens Discord authorization, but the token exchange requires backend support at `neurokaraoke.com/signin-discord`

2. **Favorites Sync:** Once authentication works, favorites can be synced from the server

3. **Dynamic Top Genres:** Replace hardcoded Top Genres with API values when endpoint is available

4. **Android Auto & TV Support:** Prepared but disabled for now - requires additional testing and MediaLibraryService implementation
