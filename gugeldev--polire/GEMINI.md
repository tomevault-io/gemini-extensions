## Project

**Polire** is a desktop typing assistant that helps users write better text — primarily targeted at people writing in a non-native language.

The app is designed to feel ambient: it runs in the system tray, stays out of the way, and is summoned with a global hotkey (`Ctrl+Alt+P`). From the root palette, `Esc` or the hotkey hides it back into the tray rather than quitting; on secondary views, `Esc` navigates back.

The product name is **Polire**.

## Stack

- **Runtime:** [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) 42 (main + renderer processes)
- **UI:** [React](https://react.dev/) 19 + [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) (strict mode)
- **Styling:** [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) v4 (CSS-first config via `@import "tailwindcss"`, no `tailwind.config.js`)
- **Icons:** [Phosphor Icons](https://phosphoricons.com/) — `@phosphor-icons/react`. Use only this library; do not introduce other icon sets (lucide, heroicons, etc). Always import with the `Icon` suffix (`GearIcon`, `SparkleIcon`, …) — the unsuffixed exports are deprecated and will trigger warnings.
- **Bundler / dev server:** [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) 6 with [`vite-plugin-electron`](https://github.com/electron-vite/vite-plugin-electron) (simple preset)
- **Package manager / runner:** [Bun](https://bun.sh/) — use `bun install`, `bun run <script>`
- **Formatter / linter:** [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) — run `bun run format` before committing
- **Target platforms:** Windows and Linux (X11 recommended for global shortcuts; Wayland support is limited)

## Build outputs

- `dist/` — bundled renderer (HTML + JS + CSS)
- `dist-electron/` — bundled main + preload (`main.js`, `preload.mjs`)
- `node_modules/.cache/tsc/` — TypeScript build info (project references)

All three are gitignored.

```

`assets/` contains native runtime resources. Any future packaging configuration must include this directory so window and tray icons remain available outside development.

Module-level state in `electron/` is intentional: `win` and `isQuitting` live as `let` bindings inside `modules/window/manager.ts` and are mutated by exported functions. Don't pull them out into a shared store — the encapsulation is the point.

### Internationalization

The renderer uses local translations through `I18nProvider` (`src/providers/i18n.tsx`) and `useI18n()` (`src/hooks/use-i18n.ts`). Message dictionaries live in `src/i18n/locales/` and support English (`en`), Brazilian Portuguese (`pt-BR`), and Spanish (`es`).

- User-facing UI text must be resolved with `t("...")`; do not hardcode labels, placeholders, hints, empty states, or visible error text in React components or views.
- When adding or changing a UI message, add the same key to all three locale dictionaries: `en.ts`, `pt-BR.ts`, and `es.ts`.
- Technical strings that are not displayed as localized UI, such as IPC validation errors, provider identifiers, persisted values, or AI prompt instructions, do not need translation keys.

### Navigation

The renderer uses a tiny stack-based router exposed through `useNav()` (`src/hooks/use-nav.ts`), backed by `NavProvider` (`src/providers/nav.tsx`):

- `push(view)` / `pop()` — mutate the stack
- `current` — top of stack
- `direction` — `1` (forward) or `-1` (back), drives the slide animation in `app.tsx`

Views that are not the root render inside `<PageLayout title="...">` so they get the back button + footer for free. Views read `current` to know whether they're the active screen — `useEffect` keyboard handlers early-return when `isActive` is false, so the offscreen view (mid-transition) doesn't intercept input.

When adding a new view: extend the `View` union in `src/types.ts`, add a branch in `renderView` (in `app.tsx`), and call `push("your-view")` from wherever it's triggered. Renderer imports may use the configured `@/` alias for `src/` modules.

## Scripts

| Command            | What it does                                                         |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `bun install`      | Install dependencies                                                 |
| `bun run dev`      | Start Vite + Electron with hot reload                                |
| `bun run build`    | `tsc -b && vite build` → outputs to `dist/` and `dist-electron/`     |
| `bun run preview`  | Serve the built renderer (without Electron) — rarely useful here     |
| `bun run format`   | Run Biome to format and lint the whole repo                          |
| `bun run test`     | Run unit and component tests with Bun                                |

## Rules

Non-negotiable do's and don'ts. These exist to keep the codebase coherent and avoid common footguns.

### Forbidden

- **No `useEffect`.** Strictly. If you think you need one, you almost certainly don't — derive state during render, use event handlers, or refs. If you cannot avoid it, stop and ask first.

- **No `any`.** Type things properly. If a type is hard to express, reach for `unknown` + narrowing, generics, or `satisfies`. `as any` casts are also forbidden — if you hit a third-party type that's wrong, add a precise interface or use `@ts-expect-error` with a one-line reason.

### Required

- **Avoid `else`.** Prefer early returns, guard clauses, or restructuring. If you're reaching for `else`, the function probably wants splitting.

  ```ts
  // ❌ avoid
  function toggleWindow() {
    if (win.isVisible() && win.isFocused()) {
      win.hide();
    } else {
      win.show();
      win.focus();
    }
  }

  // ✅ prefer
  function toggleWindow() {
    if (!win) return;
    if (win.isVisible() && win.isFocused()) return win.hide();
    showWindow();
  }
  ```

- **Names must explain themselves.** Pick names that tell the reader *what* a thing is and *why* it exists. `toggleWindow` over `tw`; `isQuitting` over `flag`; `hideOnEscape` over `handler`. A caller should not need to open the body to know what a function does.

- **JSDoc in English, when it adds signal.** Add a JSDoc comment on exported functions whenever the name alone does not capture: side effects, edge cases, why a function can return early, or what the params and return value actually mean. Use `@param` and `@returns` when their meaning is not obvious from the types alone. Skip JSDoc when the signature is fully self-evident — redundant comments are noise.

  ```ts
  /**
   * Register the global hotkey. Logs an error if the OS refuses the binding
   * (already in use, missing permission, etc).
   */
  function registerShortcuts() { /* ... */ }
  ```

  **React components are usually the exception.** Their props are typed and their names describe the rendered output (`SearchInput`, `OptionList`, `Footer`). Don't add JSDoc to a component unless it has non-obvious behavior — render side effects, controlled-vs-uncontrolled trade-offs, focus management, etc. Default to no JSDoc on components.

- **File names are kebab-case.** Always. Even for React components: `search-input.tsx`, `option-list.tsx`, `app.tsx`, `kbd.tsx`. The exported identifier inside still uses PascalCase (`SearchInput`, `OptionList`) — only the filename changes. This keeps imports portable across case-sensitive filesystems (Linux) and case-insensitive ones (macOS, Windows) without surprises.

### Workflow

- **Always use Bun.** `bun install`, `bun run <script>`, `bunx <tool>`. Do not introduce `npm`, `pnpm`, `yarn`, or `node` commands unless the user explicitly asks for another runtime/tool.

- **Use scoped Conventional Commits.** Write short commit messages in the form `<type>(<area>): <description>` when the changed area is clear (for example, `chore(docs): update contribution rules` or `feat(settings): reorder sections`). Use `<type>: <description>` when a useful scope does not apply. **Never add a body, paragraph, or bullet summary** — keep the message to a single subject line, even for multi-file or non-trivial changes; the diff carries the context. Do not add `Co-authored-by` trailers unless explicitly requested.

- **Format before finishing.** Run `bun run format` after every task — this executes Biome to format and lint the whole repo. The task isn't done until the formatter passes clean.

- **Test behavior, not markup.** Use `bun run test` for changed logic and interactive React flows. Prefer user-visible behavior and persistence rules over assertions about CSS classes, animation details, or presentational components alone.

- **Colocate test files.** Keep each `*.test.ts` or `*.test.tsx` beside the source module it exercises. Reserve `test/` for shared test setup and helpers.

- **Keep pre-commit checks enabled.** Husky runs `bun run format` and `bun run test` before commits, refreshing already-staged files after formatting. Do not bypass the hook unless explicitly requested.
