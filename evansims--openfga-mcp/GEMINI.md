## Project Overview

This is a PHP implementation of a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for OpenFGA, providing AI agents with tools to manage and query OpenFGA authorization servers.

## Model Context Protocol Concepts

Model Context Protocol solves the fundamental problem of connecting AI to your existing tools and data in a standardized, secure way. MCP creates a common language between AI models and external systems. Instead of building point-to-point integrations, you implement MCP servers that expose your tools, data, and prompts through a standard interface. Any MCP-compatible AI can then connect to any MCP server.

The real power emerges when your AI can seamlessly move between reading your calendar (resource), sending emails (tool), querying databases (resource template), and following company-specific workflows (prompts) - all through the same protocol, with proper security boundaries.

**Tools** are executable functions that perform actions or operations. Think of them as API endpoints the AI can call - they do things. A tool might send an email, create a database record, or run a calculation. Tools typically modify state or trigger external processes.

**Resources** are read-only data sources the AI can access for information. They provide content rather than perform actions. A resource might be a file, database query result, or API response that gives the AI context or data to work with.

**Resource Templates** are parameterized blueprints for generating resources dynamically. Instead of static resources, templates let you create resources on-demand based on input parameters. For example, a template might generate a user profile resource when given a user ID, or create a report resource based on date ranges.

**Prompts** are reusable prompt templates that can be invoked with parameters to generate structured prompts for the AI. They're essentially parameterized instructions or context that help shape how the AI approaches specific tasks.

The key distinction: tools _act_, resources _inform_, templates _generate_, and prompts _guide_. Tools change the world, resources describe it, templates make resources flexible, and prompts shape how the AI thinks about both.

This separation keeps concerns clean - you're not mixing data access with actions, and you can build flexible, reusable components that compose well together.

## Development Commands

### Linting and Code Quality

- `composer lint` - Run all linters (PHPStan, Psalm, Rector, PHP-CS-Fixer)
- `composer lint:fix` - Apply available automatic fixes from linters

### Testing

- `composer test` - Run all tests using Pest framework
- `composer test:unit` - Run unit tests using Pest framework
- `composer test:integration` - Run integration tests using Pest framework inside a Docker environment

## Architecture

The project has a minimal structure focused on implementing an MCP server:

- **src/Server.php**: Main class that implements the MCP server
- **src/Helpers.php**: Helper functions for MCP server (includes `isOfflineMode()`)
- **src/OfflineClient.php**: Offline client implementation that allows server to run without OpenFGA
- **src/Tools/**: Directory containing classes that expose tools for MCP client to invoke
- **src/Resources/**: Directory containing classes that expose resources for MCP client to access
- **src/Templates/**: Directory containing classes that expose resource templates for MCP client to generate resources from
- **src/Prompts/**: Directory containing classes that expose prompts for MCP client to generate structured prompts from
- **src/Documentation/**: Directory containing documentation indexing and chunking system for SDK knowledge base
- Built on top of `php-mcp/server` framework
- Uses `evansims/openfga-php` for OpenFGA client functionality

## Operating Modes

The server supports two distinct operating modes:

### Online Mode (Full Features)
When `OPENFGA_MCP_API_URL` is configured (or authentication credentials provided), the server operates with full functionality:
- All Tools work (create/manage stores, models, relationships)
- All Resources provide live data from OpenFGA
- Dynamic Completions fetch data from the server
- Prompts work as normal

### Offline Mode (Planning & Coding Only)
When no OpenFGA configuration is provided, the server operates in offline mode:
- Tools return error messages guiding users to configure OpenFGA
- Resources return error responses with helpful messages
- Completions return static defaults (e.g., common relations, object patterns)
- **Prompts work normally** - this is the key feature of offline mode

The server automatically detects the mode based on environment variables. The `OfflineClient` class implements the `ClientInterface` to maintain architectural consistency.

### Detecting Mode
```php
// Check if in offline mode
if (isOfflineMode()) {
    // Handle offline case
}

// In base classes
$error = $this->checkOfflineMode('operation name');
if (null !== $error) {
    return $error;
}
```

## Configuration Methods

The server supports two methods for configuration:

### Environment Variables (Traditional Method)
Configuration values can be set via environment variables:
```bash
OPENFGA_MCP_API_URL=https://api.example.com \
OPENFGA_MCP_API_TOKEN=your-token \
OPENFGA_MCP_TRANSPORT=http \
php bin/openfga-mcp
```

### JSON Query Parameters (New Method)
When using HTTP transport, configuration can be provided via JSON-encoded query parameters:
```
GET /mcp?config={"OPENFGA_MCP_API_URL":"https://api.example.com","OPENFGA_MCP_API_TOKEN":"token"}
```

**Configuration Precedence Order:**
1. JSON query parameter values (highest priority)
2. Environment variables via $_ENV
3. Environment variables via getenv()
4. Default values (lowest priority)

**Example JSON Configuration:**
```json
{
  "OPENFGA_MCP_API_URL": "https://api.example.com",
  "OPENFGA_MCP_API_TOKEN": "bearer-token",
  "OPENFGA_MCP_API_WRITEABLE": true,
  "OPENFGA_MCP_API_STORE": "store-id",
  "OPENFGA_MCP_API_MODEL": "model-id",
  "OPENFGA_MCP_DEBUG": false
}
```

**Implementation Notes:**
- The `ConfigurableHttpServerTransport` class extends the base HTTP transport
- Configuration is parsed by the `ConfigurationParser` class
- Invalid JSON returns a 400 error with detailed error messages
- All configuration keys must match the environment variable names exactly

## Code Standards

- **PHP Version**: 8.3+ required
- **Type Safety**: Strict typing enforced by PHPStan (level max) and Psalm (errorLevel 1)
- **Code Style**: Modern PHP with PSR compliance, final classes enforced
- **Namespace**: `OpenFGA\MCP`
- **Autoloading**: PSR-4
- **Testing**: Pest framework, Mockery dependency

## Mission Critical Notes

- Always follow SOLID, DRY and KISS principles.
- All tests and linters MUST pass after each change.
- All code changes MUST have accompanying tests.
- All code changes SHOULD have a clear and concise purpose.
- When addressing PHPStan, Psalm or other PHP linter warnings, always address the underlying issues directly, never use suppression tactics. You are forbidden from using suppression annotations or adding ignore statements to configuration files. If you are unable to address a warning, ask for help.
- Never skip tests. If a test fails, you must address the underlying cause directly. If you are unable to fix a failing test, ask for help.

## Security Model

The server follows a **safety-first approach** for write operations:
- **Default**: Write operations are disabled (`OPENFGA_MCP_API_WRITEABLE=false`)
- **To Enable**: Must explicitly set `OPENFGA_MCP_API_WRITEABLE=true`
- This prevents accidental destructive operations (create, update, delete) on OpenFGA instances
- Read operations are always allowed when connected to an OpenFGA instance

## Debug Logging

For development and troubleshooting, the server includes comprehensive debug logging that is **enabled by default**.

### Control Debug Logging
Debug logging is enabled by default. To disable it, set:
```bash
OPENFGA_MCP_DEBUG=false
```

### What Gets Logged
All MCP requests and responses are logged to `logs/mcp-debug.log` in the project root directory. The logger automatically finds the project root by looking for `composer.json`, ensuring logs are written to the correct location regardless of the working directory from which the MCP server is invoked.

**Comprehensive Coverage:** The `LoggingStdioTransport` logs ALL MCP protocol interactions at the JSON-RPC transport level, including:

- **Tools** - All tool invocations (`tools/call`) with parameters and results
- **Resources** - All resource access (`resources/read`) including URIs and content  
- **Resource Templates** - All template-based resource generation
- **Prompts** - All prompt retrievals (`prompts/get`) with arguments and responses
- **Completions** - All completion requests (`completion/complete`) with context
- **System Messages** - Initialization, heartbeats (ping), and notifications
- **Errors** - Complete error responses with stack traces and context

Each log entry includes:
- **Timestamp** - When the interaction occurred
- **Request ID** - For matching requests with responses
- **Method** - The MCP protocol method being called
- **Parameters** - Full request parameters (with array keys normalized to strings)
- **Response** - Complete response data

### Log Format
Each log entry is a JSON object with structured data:
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-01-15 10:30:45",
  "type": "REQUEST|RESPONSE|TOOL_CALL|ERROR",
  "id": "request-id",
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {...}
}
```

### Usage Tips
- Enable debug logging when MCP client calls are not working as expected
- Check the log file to see exactly what parameters are being sent/received
- Use request IDs to match requests with their responses
- Debug logs help identify parameter naming mismatches between client and server

## Documentation System

The server includes a comprehensive documentation system that exposes OpenFGA SDK documentation as MCP resources and tools, enabling AI agents to access framework-specific knowledge for accurate code generation.

### Available Documentation Resources

- `openfga://docs` - List all available SDK documentation and guides
- `openfga://docs/{sdk}` - Get SDK overview (php, go, python, java, dotnet, js, laravel)
- `openfga://docs/{sdk}/class/{className}` - Get detailed class documentation
- `openfga://docs/{sdk}/method/{className}/{methodName}` - Get method documentation
- `openfga://docs/{sdk}/section/{sectionName}` - Get documentation section content
- `openfga://docs/{sdk}/chunk/{chunkId}` - Get specific content chunk
- `openfga://docs/search/{query}` - Search across all documentation

### Available Documentation Tools

- `search_documentation` - Advanced search with SDK filtering, search types (content, class, method, section), and result limiting
- `search_code_examples` - Find code examples with language filtering and context information
- `find_similar_documentation` - Semantic similarity search for finding related content

### Documentation Features

- **Smart Chunking**: Multiple chunking strategies (by size, headers, source blocks, code blocks)
- **Offline Support**: Full documentation access without OpenFGA connection required
- **Multi-SDK Coverage**: Supports all major OpenFGA SDKs (PHP, Go, Python, Java, .NET, JavaScript, Laravel)
- **Context-Aware Search**: Relevance scoring based on class names, methods, and sections
- **Code Example Extraction**: Automatic identification and extraction of runnable code examples
- **Hierarchical Navigation**: Browse documentation by SDK → Class → Method structure

The documentation system automatically indexes and chunks the compiled SDK documentation from the `docs/` directory, providing agents with comprehensive knowledge for generating accurate, framework-specific code.

## Important Implementation Notes

### MCP Resources Implementation

When implementing MCP resources:

1. Resources are read-only data sources - they should never modify state
2. Resource URIs should follow the pattern: `openfga://[resource-path]`
3. Resource templates use URI templates (RFC 6570) for parameterization
4. All resource classes should extend `AbstractResources` and be placed in `src/Resources/`
5. Resource methods should return arrays or strings that will be auto-converted to TextContent
6. Use the same error handling pattern as tools (with emoji indicators: ✅ for success, ❌ for errors)

### OpenFGA PHP SDK Method Names

The OpenFGA PHP SDK uses these method patterns:
- Direct client methods: `listStores()`, `getStore()`, `check()`, `expand()`, `readTuples()`
- Response methods typically use `get` prefix: `getStores()`, `getModels()`, `getTuples()`
- Tuple methods are on the key: `$tuple->getKey()->getUser()`, not `$tuple->getUser()`
- The `check()` method requires both store and model parameters
- For creating tuples, use `grantPermission()` not `createRelationship()`
