Notes for Claude (and humans) working on this repo.

## What this is

Cross-platform (macOS, Windows, Linux) desktop client for the public **JLab static
JAR scanner** at `https://jlab.threat.rip/api/public/static-scan`. User drops
a `.jar` (or a `.zip` / `.mcpack` / `.mrpack` containing one), the app
uploads it as `multipart/form-data`, and renders the matched signatures
grouped by severity. For container drops, the Rust side opens the archive,
picks the largest inner `.jar`, and uploads only that file.

Open-source, dual-licensed **MIT OR Apache-2.0**. Repo:
`https://github.com/NeikiDev/jlab-desktop`.

## Stack

- **Shell:** Tauri 2 (Rust)
- **Frontend:** React 19 + TypeScript + Vite, styled with Tailwind v4 (tokens defined in `@theme` inside `src/index.css`, wired up via `@tailwindcss/vite`, no `tailwind.config.js`, no PostCSS config)
- **HTTP:** `reqwest` 0.12 with `multipart` + `rustls-tls` (no OpenSSL)
- **Async runtime:** `tokio`
- **Errors:** `thiserror` + `serde(tag = "kind")` so the frontend can discriminate

The HTTP upload runs in **Rust**, never in the webview. File bytes don't
cross the IPC boundary as JSON. The frontend only passes the file path.

### Folder watcher (`src-tauri/src/watcher/`)

Opt-in. Off by default. Reuses the manual `scan_jar` pipeline via
`api::run_scan(.., source: ScanSource)`.

```
watcher/
  mod.rs        // declares submodules + re-exports WatcherStore
  settings.rs   // WatcherSettings, atomic JSON store, validate_watch_path
  core.rs       // WatcherStore, debouncer, mpsc queue, 12 req/min
                // token bucket, process_one, event emitter
  hold.rs       // rename foo.jar <-> foo.jar.jlab-pending
                // recover_stragglers() on startup
  trash.rs      // OS trash via the `trash` crate
  quarantine.rs // move to <data_dir>/quarantine/<ts>-<name>.quarantined
  rescan.rs     // 6 h scheduler, re-queues stale jars (7 / 14 / 30 d)
  notify.rs     // coalesced native notifications (4 s window)
  tray.rs       // TrayIconBuilder + menu (open / pause / quit)
  commands.rs   // #[tauri::command] entry points
```

Settings file: `watcher-settings.json` next to `history.json` in
`paths::friendly_data_dir()`. Schema `version: 1` with `#[serde(default)]`
on additive fields so older files migrate cleanly. The `auto_action`
field also has `#[serde(alias = "autoDelete")]` so settings written
under the previous name still load.

Quarantine: `<data_dir>/quarantine/` (lazy-created, `0o700` on Unix).
Files land as `<unix-timestamp>-<original-name>.quarantined`. The suffix
prevents Java launchers from loading them and stops external AV from
auto-classifying them as live `.jar` payloads. Rename first, copy +
delete fallback for cross-volume cases.

Auto-action is two fields:
- `auto_action: ActionThreshold` — `off` | `multiple_criticals` |
  `confirmed_families_only`. Default `multiple_criticals`.
- `auto_action_mode: ActionMode` — `quarantine` | `trash`. Default
  `quarantine` (per-user request: prefer recoverable quarantine over
  trash).

`WatcherEvent::ScanCompleted.action: Option<String>` carries
`"quarantined"` / `"trashed"` / `null` so the frontend renders the
correct chip on the recent-hits row.

Hold-until-scanned: while a scan runs, the file is renamed in place to
add `.jlab-pending`. After the scan the suffix is removed (or
auto-action runs). On app start `hold::recover_stragglers` re-queues any
`*.jlab-pending` files left over from a previous run that crashed.

`api::run_scan` strips the `.jlab-pending` suffix from the path string
for extension validation and the upload filename, so held files upload
under their original name even though they live at the suffixed path on
disk.

Rate limit: single consumer task drains the mpsc queue through a token
bucket capped at `WATCHER_REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE = 12`. On HTTP 429 the
consumer sleeps for `Retry-After`. The cap is 3 under the public API's
15/min cap so manual drag-drop scans still go through.

ScanSource plumbing: `api::run_scan` takes `ScanSource::{Manual,
Watcher}` and (a) skips `scan://phase` IPC events when `Watcher` (the
watcher panel has its own status surface), (b) tags
`HistoryEntry.source` as `"manual"` or `"watcher"`.

Tray: Tauri 2's built-in `TrayIconBuilder`, lazily built the first time
`minimize_to_tray` flips on. Menu: open / pause / quit. The window's
`CloseRequested` handler in `lib.rs` calls `api.prevent_close()` and
hides the window when `minimize_to_tray` is true.

Autostart: `tauri-plugin-autostart` with
`MacosLauncher::LaunchAgent`. `launch_at_login` is reconciled with the
OS state on every startup so manual launch-agent deletions are
recovered.

Frontend layout (`src/lib/components/WatcherPanel.tsx`): hero card with
master toggle + status + "how it works" expander, then a dim-when-off
section containing the current-scan card, full-width folders card, and
a settings grid (1 / 2 / 3 columns at 600 / 1180 px). The dashboard's
folder-watcher card flips `showingWatcher` in `App.tsx`.

**UI states (driven by `App.tsx`'s `ScanState`):**
- `idle`: hero copy, drop zone, three step cards. The marketing surface.
- `scanning`: `ScanProgress` with elapsed counter, phase list, rotating tip.
- `result`: `SignatureList` (file metadata header, severity counts, grouped signature cards).
- `error`: `ErrorBanner` above the drop zone so retry is one click away.

**Default window:** `1180 x 780`, min `760 x 540`, centered on first launch (set in `tauri.conf.json`). Don't shrink defaults below this without a reason. The result view needs room for five severity columns.

## Toolchain requirements

- **Rust ≥ 1.85** (edition2024 stable). `rust-version = "1.85"` is pinned in `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`.
- **Node 20+** (CI uses 20).
- **Tauri 2 platform prereqs:** <https://tauri.app/start/prerequisites/>.

## Common commands

```bash
npm install
npm run tauri dev              # dev with hot reload
npm run tauri build            # release bundle for current OS
npm run check                  # tsc --noEmit
cargo check --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml
cargo fmt --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml
cargo clippy --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml -- -D warnings
```

Icons (one-time, after replacing the placeholder):

```bash
npm run tauri icon path/to/source-1024.png
```

## API contract

Single endpoint, no auth, public. Documented at <https://jlab.threat.rip/api-docs.html>.

```
POST https://jlab.threat.rip/api/public/static-scan
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
Field:        file (≤ 50 MB, .jar)
Rate limit:   15 requests / minute / IP
```

The endpoint only accepts a single `.jar`. The desktop client accepts a
broader set of inputs and unwraps containers locally before upload.

**Accepted local inputs (`src-tauri/src/api.rs`):**

| Extension | Handling                                                        |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `.jar`    | uploaded as-is                                                  |
| `.zip`    | opened locally, largest inner `.jar` is extracted and uploaded  |
| `.mcpack` | same as `.zip`                                                  |
| `.mrpack` | same as `.zip`                                                  |
| other     | rejected with `AppError::UnsupportedFile`                       |

**Container handling rules:**

- Magic-byte check: every accepted input must start with a `PK` zip
  signature. Renamed text files are rejected with `UnsupportedFile`.
- Multi-jar archives: the **largest inner `.jar` by uncompressed size** is
  picked. Rationale: in modpacks the largest jar is almost always the
  payload while bundled libraries already have their own signatures, and
  the API is single-file + 15 req / minute, so scanning every jar is not
  practical. Document any change to this policy.
- Inner jar size limit: the extracted inner `.jar` itself must be ≤ 50 MB.
  This is what guards against zip bombs (the entry's uncompressed `size()`
  is checked before extraction).
- Empty archives or archives without any `.jar` entry produce
  `AppError::NoJarInArchive`.

Status mapping in `src-tauri/src/api.rs`:

| Status | Maps to                                       |
|--------|-----------------------------------------------|
| 200    | `ScanResult` (success)                        |
| 413    | `AppError::TooLarge { max_mb: 50 }`           |
| 429    | `AppError::RateLimited { retry_after_seconds }` (parses `Retry-After`) |
| other  | `AppError::Server { status, message }`        |

Local 50 MB check happens **before** the network call to avoid wasted upload.

## Domain model

Anything below is what the JLab API actually returns today. Frontend types in `src/lib/types.ts` and Rust types in `src-tauri/src/api.rs` mirror this. Keep them in sync.

**Severity scale (ordered, most to least severe):**

```
critical | high | medium | low | info
```

All five render. UI order in `SignatureList.tsx` matches this list. Unknown values fall back to `info`.

**Signature `type` ↔ `kind` rename:**
The API uses the JSON field name `type` per signature. The frontend mirror in `types.ts` keeps it as `kind` so it does not shadow the TS keyword. When extending, keep the rename. Don't propagate `type` past the API boundary. The Rust shell forwards the raw JSON via `serde_json::Value`, so there is no Rust struct rename to maintain today.

Known `kind` values today: `string`, `reference`, `bytecode`, `composite`, `heuristic`, `structural`, `deobfuscation`. `SignatureKind` in `types.ts` is `string`, so new values do not break compile, but list them here when the API adds one.

**Confirmed families:**
`confirmedFamilies` is an array of `{ name: string }`. The server suppresses per-family signature counts by design to avoid leaking which detection fired (an attacker can otherwise iterate evasions until the count drops). `ConfirmedFamily.signatureCount` stays optional in `types.ts` for older responses but the UI no longer relies on it.

When one or more families are confirmed, the server also redacts individual signatures: `name` becomes `"Encoded content"`, `description` is dropped, `id` is omitted, and `redacted: true` is set on the signature. The frontend treats redaction as authoritative and does not try to undo it.

**Signature match shape:**
A match always carries `className` and `member` when location is known. `deobfuscation` matches additionally carry `encoding`, `original` (the encoded bytes), and `decoded` (the recovered plaintext). Older response shapes also included `path` and `matchedValue`; both are kept optional on `SignatureMatch` so transitional payloads still render.

```ts
{
  className?:    string | null   // e.g. "net/fabricmc/.../EventFactoryImpl"
  member?:       string | null   // method signature with descriptor
  encoding?:     string | null   // deobfuscation: scheme, e.g. "xor-base64"
  original?:     string | null   // deobfuscation: encoded source
  decoded?:      string | null   // deobfuscation: recovered plaintext
  path?:         string | null   // legacy: archive path, may contain "!/"
  matchedValue?: string | null   // legacy: literal that matched
}
```

`SignatureCard.tsx` filters out matches where every field is empty, then renders each non-empty field row by row. When the API adds another field, extend `hasContent` and the renderer; do not silently drop it.

**Top-level `note`:**
The response includes a `note` field with the server's "matches alone are not a verdict" advisory. The desktop client renders its own copy of this caveat (see `SignatureDisclaimer.tsx`), so we don't surface `note` verbatim, but it is preserved as `ScanResult.note` for future use.

## Design rules

- **Tauri commands.** Defined in `src-tauri/src/api.rs`, registered in
  `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` (`invoke_handler` block). Today they cover
  scanning (`scan_jar`, `cancel_scan`), service status (`check_status`,
  `check_for_update`, `app_version`), URL opening (`open_url`), log
  management (`open_log_dir`, `clear_logs`, `log_dir_size`), and local
  history (`history_list`, `history_clear`, `history_delete`). Add new
  commands sparingly; prefer extending an existing flow.
- **Outbound HTTP must send `x-jlab-client: desktop`.** Both `scan_jar` and `check_status` set it. Any future request to `jlab.threat.rip` must do the same.
- **Errors are typed, not strings.** Always extend `AppError` (with a new `#[serde(rename_all = "snake_case")]` variant) and the matching union in `src/lib/types.ts`. Never return raw `String` errors to the frontend. The `ErrorBanner` component switches on `kind`.
- **The frontend doesn't talk HTTP.** All network traffic goes through Rust. The CSP is `connect-src ipc: http://ipc.localhost`. Both sources are Tauri 2's IPC handler and are required for `invoke()`, so do not drop `http://ipc.localhost`. `script-src 'self'` blocks inline and remote scripts. `img-src 'self' data: asset: http://asset.localhost` covers Tauri's local-asset protocol. Adding `fetch()` calls to a public URL in React will be blocked; route through a Rust command instead.
- **React functional components with hooks only.** No class components. Use `useState`, `useReducer`, `useMemo`, `useEffect`, `useRef`, `useCallback`. The `react-jsx` runtime is on, so no `import React` is needed in `.tsx` files. Do not enable `<StrictMode>` in `main.tsx` (the Tauri drag-drop listener and the `RemoteStatus` polling are designed for single-registration; StrictMode's dev double-mount would duplicate them).
- **State machine is the source of truth.** `App.tsx`'s `ScanState` discriminated union drives everything via `useReducer`. Don't add side-state for "scanning AND error simultaneously". Encode it as a new variant if needed.
- **Tailwind v4, tokens in `src/index.css` `@theme`.** No `tailwind.config.js`, no `postcss.config.js`. Compose utility classes; use `var(--token)` only when bracket syntax preserves an exact value (animations, exact radii). Do not write per-component `<style>` blocks: React has no scoped CSS, and one-offs should land in `src/index.css` with a clearly-named class.
- **Drag-drop must use the Tauri webview event.** `getCurrentWebview().onDragDropEvent()` is the only path that delivers native file paths on macOS, Windows, and Linux (webkit2gtk). JSX `onDragOver`/`onDrop` will not work for native drops. Do not "simplify" the listener pattern in `DropZone.tsx`.

## Performance

Always optimize the frontend AND the Rust backend for a fast and smooth user experience. The desktop app should feel instant, never janky.

**Frontend (React / CSS):**
- Animate only `transform` and `opacity`. Never animate `width`, `height`, `top`, or `left`.
- Use the easing tokens from `index.css` (`--ease-out`, `--ease-in-out`, `--duration-fast`, `--duration-base`, `--duration-slow`) and the named animations (`animate-fade-in`, `animate-slide-in`, `animate-spin-fast`, `animate-indeterminate`, `animate-pulse-soft`, `animate-status-pulse`). Don't hand-write durations or `ease` curves in components.
- Add `content-visibility: auto` with `contain-intrinsic-size` to repeated cards in long lists (see `SignatureCard.tsx`).
- Use `will-change` only on elements that animate on hover or open, not persistently.
- Honor `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)`. The global override is in `index.css`. Don't add component-level animations that bypass it.
- Use stable `key={item.id}` on every `.map(...)`. Avoid index keys when items reorder.
- Keep `useMemo` cheap, and use it only when the derivation is non-trivial. If a derivation iterates the full list, do it once at the top of the component, not per child.
- Don't ship debug logs, polling timers, or `setInterval` work in idle states. Tear them down in the `useEffect` cleanup function.

**Rust backend (Tauri commands):**
- Stream and read files in chunks. Don't `std::fs::read` an entire 50 MB blob into memory if it can be avoided.
- Run blocking work on `tokio::task::spawn_blocking`. The Tauri command should never block the IPC thread.
- Reuse the `reqwest::Client`. Build it once in `lib.rs` and store it in app state. Never construct a fresh client per request.
- Set tight timeouts on every outbound request. No request should hang the UI forever.
- Return early on validation (file size, extension) before any network call.
- Errors must be typed (`AppError`) so the frontend renders without parsing strings.

## Writing style

When you write text that lands in the codebase (UI copy, comments, docs, commit messages, PR descriptions, README, CLAUDE.md), and when you reply to the user:

- **No em dashes.** Never use `—` or `–`. Use a period, a comma, a colon, or parentheses instead. Rewrite the sentence if needed.
- **Easy language.** Prefer short, plain words and short sentences. Avoid jargon when a normal word works. Don't pile clauses; split into two sentences.
- Write for someone scanning the screen, not reading a paragraph.
- One idea per sentence. Cut hedge words ("just", "simply", "basically", "actually").
- Active voice, present tense, second person where it fits.

## Things to deliberately NOT add

- Auth / login (API is public).
- Telemetry of any kind.

## Local history

Past scans are persisted on the user's device, no network involved.

- File: `history.json` in the friendly app data dir resolved by
  `paths::friendly_data_dir()`. The folder name (`JLab`) is intentionally
  decoupled from the Tauri bundle identifier (`rip.threat.jlab-desktop`)
  so users do not see a reverse-DNS folder. Resolved once at startup and
  stored in app state as `HistoryStore`. Platform layout:
  `~/Library/Application Support/JLab/` (macOS),
  `%APPDATA%\JLab\` (Windows),
  `$XDG_DATA_HOME/JLab/` or `~/.local/share/JLab/` (Linux).
- Schema: `{ version: 1, entries: HistoryEntry[] }`. An entry holds `id`,
  `scannedAt` (ISO 8601 UTC), `fileName`, `fileSizeBytes`, `sha256`,
  `severityCounts`, `topSeverity`, and `signatureCount`. Mirrored in
  `src/lib/types.ts`.
- Cap: `HISTORY_CAP = 100` (in `src-tauri/src/history.rs`). On overflow the
  oldest entries are dropped during `append`.
- Writes are atomic (write to `history.json.tmp`, then rename). All file IO
  runs on `tokio::task::spawn_blocking`.
- No raw signature payload, no file bytes, and no API response body is
  stored. Only the small summary above.
- Append happens after a successful 200 from the scan endpoint. If history
  IO fails the scan still succeeds; the failure is logged.

## CI

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs on every PR and on push to `dev`. Matrix
  on macOS, Windows, and `ubuntu-24.04`: `npm run check`, `cargo fmt
  --check`, `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`, `cargo check`, plus a `tauri
  build --debug` smoke job and a `gitleaks` scan. The Ubuntu jobs install
  Tauri's apt prereqs (`libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev`, `libssl-dev`,
  `libayatana-appindicator3-dev`, `librsvg2-dev`, `patchelf`, `file`,
  `libfuse2t64`).
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` triggers on push to `main` and on
  `workflow_dispatch`. The version-gate job reads
  `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`. If the version is new (no matching `v*`
  tag), it builds macOS (`--target universal-apple-darwin`), Windows, and
  Linux (`ubuntu-24.04`), attaches `.dmg`, `.msi`, `.exe`, `.deb`, `.rpm`,
  and `.AppImage` to a GitHub Release, and tags `v<version>`. There is no
  signed updater manifest today (`bundle.createUpdaterArtifacts` is
  `false`); updates are manual via the Releases page.

## TODOs

Tracked under `TODO/` (see `TODO/README.md`). Use the `/todo` skill to add,
update, or implement TODOs. `/todo <id>` runs the autonomous fix flow.

## Git / GitHub

- Default remote: `origin → https://github.com/NeikiDev/jlab-desktop.git`.
- `gh repo set-default` is configured for this directory.
- Branch model: feature work on `dev` (or feature branches into `dev`),
  PRs target `main`, every merge to `main` ships a release.

## When in doubt

The API has no test endpoint. For offline iteration, mock by stubbing
`scan_jar` to return a fixture `ScanResult`.
