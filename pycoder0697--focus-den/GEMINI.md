# Focus Den — Project Context for Claude Code

## What this is
A single-file HTML study productivity app for a UPSC Civil Services aspirant.
Live at: https://pycoder0697.github.io/focus-den/
Repo: https://github.com/Pycoder0697/focus-den
Embedded in Notion via iframe.

## File structure
One file only: `index.html`
- All CSS is in a `<style>` block in the `<head>`
- All JS is in a single `<script>` block at the bottom of `<body>`
- No build step, no framework, no dependencies — pure vanilla HTML/CSS/JS
- Deploy = commit index.html → GitHub Pages auto-deploys in ~1 min

## Architecture decisions (do not change without discussion)
- **Unified task model**: one global `tasks` array is the source of truth. Subjects tab and Tasks tab are both filtered views of this array — never reintroduce per-subject todo arrays. **Subjects are tags**: a task carries **`subjectIds: []`** (multi-select), and `t.subjectId` is kept = `subjectIds[0]` (the *primary*, which drives chip colour and the logging bucket) — so the many display/colour/snapshot reads of `t.subjectId` keep working. Mutate via the helpers (`subjectIdsOf`/`setTaskSubjects`/`addTaskSubject`/`removeTaskSubject`/`toggleTaskSubject` near `tasksForSubject`), never by hand. Membership reads (`tasksForSubject`, the Filter, group-by-subject, the focus-picker `subj:` scope) check `subjectIdsOf(t).includes(id)`, so a task shows under **every** subject it's tagged with. A focus session on a multi-subject task **splits its time evenly** across those subjects: `commit` pushes one session row per subject with `share=1/N`, and `sdur(s)=dur(s.start,s.end)*(s.share||1)` is used at every session-duration aggregation (so totals never double-count; single-subject rows have no `share` ⇒ ×1, unchanged). The Log timeline (`renderTimeline`) **re-merges** those per-subject rows (same `start|end|taskId`) into one entry that lists every subject and the full block duration; its delete removes the whole group.
- **Task-first focus (subject is a tag)**: the timer's focus target is chosen **task-first**, with the subject behaving as a tag attached to the task — mirroring TickTick's focus picker. The timer card has NO visible Subject/Task dropdowns; instead a centered `.focus-pick` header (`#focusPick`) above `#clock` shows the current target (`renderFocusHeader()`: task name + its subject on a sub-line, or a bare subject/habit, or "Focus") and opens the picker popover (`#fpickPop`, `openFocusPicker`/`renderFocusPicker`, modelled on `openTaskFilter`). Picker tabs **Recent · Task · Subject · Habit** (`fpickTab`) + a search box; the **Task** tab has a list-selector dropdown (`#fpickListSel` → `#fpickScopeMenu`, `fpickScope`) = Today/Tomorrow/Next 7 Days/Inbox/All, then **Boards** (TickTick "Lists"), then **Subjects** (TickTick "Tags"), with tasks grouped Overdue→by-date. The picker **only selects** (`selectFocusTask`/`selectFocusSubject`/`selectFocusHabit`/`clearFocus` set the binding + header); the existing **Start** button runs the timer. **`#activeSubject` is kept in the DOM but hidden** as the subject source of truth (so `activeSubjectId()`, snapshot/restore, the Subjects-page ▶, and all `.value` reads stay unchanged); the old visible `#activeTask` select and `renderTaskSelect`/`syncSubjectLock` cosmetics are retired (`renderTaskSelect` is now a null-guarded no-op). You can run a **task with no subject** and a **subject with no task**. A habit-bound focus (`currentHabit`) logs its span with no subject and **auto-checks the habit for today** on a completed focus block (guarded in `commit` so it never wraps an already-done habit). Stats/Log stay subject-dominant. `currentHabit` rides `timerSnap`/`restoreTimer`.
- **Storage**: `localStorage` with an in-memory fallback (`mem{}`) for sandboxed iframes (Notion). Cloud sync via Firebase Realtime DB — credentials live in `CLOUD.url` and `CLOUD.key` at the top of the script. Cloud sync is last-write-wins per-snapshot **except the append-only logs** (`sessions`, `distractions`), which **merge** on every pull (`mergeLog` in `applyRemote` + boot): union local∪remote by `id` so a concurrent device or the always-open Notion embed saving a stale snapshot can NEVER erase a just-committed study session. Deletions stay sticky via `tombstones` (`{logId:deletedAt}`, rides the snapshot, pruned after 90 days) so a merge can't resurrect a deleted row — record one with `tombstone(id)` before filtering a session/distraction out. Don't revert these back to wholesale `sessions=cloud.sessions` replacement; that's the bug that lost study time.
- **Notion database sync — REMOVED (2026-07-30, v2.11.0)**: the two-way Notion-database mirror, the Notion Start/Stop timer buttons, and their Cloudflare `notion-proxy-worker.js` were fully removed. Tasks that were previously imported from Notion remain as ordinary local tasks (their dead `notionSourceId`/`notionPageId` fields are ignored). The app is still *embedded* in Notion via an iframe (that is just hosting — unrelated to the removed sync). `push-backend/push-worker.js` keeps only the Web-Push alarm fan-out.
- **PWA + notifications**: the app is an installable PWA (`manifest.webmanifest`, `sw.js`, PNG icons). `sw.js` is **network-first** for same-origin GETs (so a GitHub Pages push auto-updates with NO cache-version bump — never add one) and stale-while-revalidate for Google Fonts (offline support). SW registration is **skipped inside the Notion iframe** (`window.self!==window.top`). **Timer notifications** have three layers: (1) `chime()`/`flash()` in-app; (2) **local notifications** — `settings.notify` toggle → `fdNotify()` → `reg.showNotification()` (iOS-compatible), fired once per phase end via `signalPhaseChange()` in `tickFn` (works while the app is open/backgrounded-alive); (3) **Cross-device Web Push for a CLOSED app** (`push-backend/`, NOT part of index.html) — notifications now land on **every** device regardless of which one runs the timer. Three keys under the SEPARATE `/push/<CLOUD.key>` subtree (so the app's `/focusden/<key>` blob never clobbers them, and — critically — all under the already-permitted `/push` rules so NO Firebase-rules redeploy is needed): `subs/<device>={sub,alive,device}` (each device registers its `PushSubscription` + a liveness **heartbeat** `alive`, refreshed ~30s while visible via `pushHeartbeat()`), `alarm={schedule:[…],tag,owner,savedAt}` (the running device writes ONE shared alarm with every upcoming boundary via `pushAlarmSync()`/`_pushAlarmFlush()` hooked into `saveTimer()`), and `live` (the cross-device live-timer mirror, see below). The Cloudflare Worker (`push-worker.js`) on a 1-min cron drains `alarm.schedule` and, for each due boundary, pushes (VAPID + aes128gcm, self-contained WebCrypto) to **every device whose `alive` heartbeat is STALE** (app closed) and **skips fresh ones** (app open → it already notified locally) — so exactly one banner per device. Dead subs (404/410) are pruned; legacy per-device alarms still drained for back-compat. Turning `settings.notify` off deletes this device's `subs` entry. Client config: `PUSH_VAPID_PUBLIC` const (empty ⇒ push off, local + live-mirror still work) + `ensurePushSub()`. Deploy/keys: `push-backend/README.md` + `generate-vapid.mjs`. iOS web push needs the **Home-Screen-installed** PWA (16.4+); cron granularity ⇒ closed-app push up to ~60s late.
- **Cross-device live timer mirror**: a session started on one device is **visible in real time** on every other device. The running device publishes its live state (mode/phase/endStamp/task+subject labels/`pushSchedule()`) to ONE shared `/push/<CLOUD.key>/live` record via `timerStateSync()`→`_timerStateFlush()` (debounced, hooked into `saveTimer()`; cleared to `{active:false}` when its own session ends; republished on the 30s heartbeat so a long steady phase never looks stale). Idle devices poll it (`pollTimerState()`, every 5s + on refocus) and render a live-counting "Running on your other device" panel (`#remoteTimer`, `renderMirror()`/`mirrorClockText()`, ticked by `mirrorTick()` every 1s). A device with its OWN live timer (`active||workedMs>0`) always wins and shows no mirror; a remote record is ignored if `savedAt` is >120s stale (device gone). `mirrorTick()` also fires a local `chime()`+`fdNotify()` once per boundary it crosses (keyed in `_mirrorNotified`), so an **open** non-running device alerts you too — closed ones are covered by the push fan-out above. Gated on `cloudOn()` only (works without a VAPID key). Don't move the mirror state into `snapshot()` — it's a separate high-frequency record, deliberately NOT in the last-write-wins state blob.
- **Timer is wall-clock-anchored** (not interval-driven): iOS freezes JS timers when the PWA is backgrounded, so `startTimer(anchor)` begins each chained phase at the previous phase's `endStamp` (not "now"), and `tickFn` **loops `completePhase()`** to replay every boundary missed during suspension, then recomputes `remaining`. `endSeg(cap)`/`commit(logIt,cap)` log focus time capped at the phase boundary. `restoreTimer` catches up on reload too. Don't reintroduce `Date.now()`-relative phase starts.
- **Theme**: CSS variables on `html[data-theme="dark|light"]`. Never hardcode colours — always use the CSS vars defined in `:root`.
- **No frameworks**: no React, no Vue, no build tools. Keep it one file.
- **IST timezone**: all date/time logic uses `Asia/Kolkata`. `todayKey()` returns YYYY-MM-DD in IST.

## Key globals
- `tasks` — unified task array
- `subjects` — subject list (colour, name, id — no todos)
- `sessions` — stopwatch/pomodoro session log (`{id,subjectId,start,end,taskId,share?}`; `share`<1 ⇒ this row is one slice of a multi-subject focus block — sum with `sdur(s)`)
- `currentTask` / `currentHabit` — the timer's bound task / habit (see "Task-first focus"); `$('activeSubject')` (hidden select) holds the bound subject. `fpickTab`/`fpickScope` — focus-picker UI state
- `settings` — user preferences (examDate, urgentDays, theme, focus/short/long mins, etc.)
- **Top-level pages** (nav rail `.railtab` data-tab): subjects · tasks · calendar · **horizon** · **countdown** · stats · log · music. Horizon and Countdown are their OWN pages (not Tasks sub-views). `switchTab(name)` shows `#tab-<name>`; horizon→`renderHorizonTab()`, countdown→`renderCountdownTab()`.
- **Prime pane (Horizon ▸ Prime)**: the first sub-pane of the Horizon page (`HZ_PANES` `['prime','Prime']`, routed in `renderHorizon`→`renderPrime(host)`) is a pre-day **mindset ritual** — not a task view. Five collapsible `<details>` sections in order: **Vision board · Visualisation · Affirmations · Daily mission statement · Gratitude**. Static content lives in `PRIME_VIS`/`PRIME_AFF`/`PRIME_GRAT` consts. The only writable field is the **daily mission** textarea (background `placeholder` is the prompt; the user types over it), persisted to `settings.missions[todayKey()]` (per-day, rides cloud sync via `settings`, debounced `save()`). The vision image is `settings.visionImg` (a canvas-downscaled JPEG data URL set via the in-pane "Change image" picker, `loadVisionImg`) **or** the repo file `vision-board.jpg` (default), with a CSS `.vb-missing` fallback when neither loads.
- **Reflect pane (Horizon ▸ Reflect)**: the second Horizon sub-pane (`HZ_PANES` `['reflect','Reflect']`, routed in `renderHorizon`→`renderReflect(host)`) is the **evening counterpart to Prime** — a Day One-style daily journal. Two-pane layout (`.reflect`): an **entry editor** (`renderReflectEditor`, `#rfMain`) with sections **Daily journal (title + photo + body) · Highlight of the day · One lesson learned · Gratitude (read-only, `REFLECT_GRAT`) · Plans for tomorrow**, beside an **endlessly-scrollable photo calendar** (`renderReflectCal`/`rfMonthHTML`/`rfCalScroll`, `#rfCal`) that prepends/appends 6-month chunks on scroll (`_rfFrom`/`_rfTo` month-index range) and shows each day's compressed photo as the cell background (number overlaid) or a dot if the day has text. **One entry per day** keyed in `settings.journal[YYYY-MM-DD]` = `{title,body,photo,highlight,lesson,plans,updated}` — rides cloud sync via `settings`, so photos appear on every device's calendar. `reflectDate` is the day being edited; the date bar (‹ › / Today·Yesterday·Tomorrow) and clicking a calendar cell both call `selectReflectDay(k)` (re-renders only the editor, repaints the selected cell — calendar scroll is preserved). Text fields persist debounced via `rfBindText` (live write to the object, `save()` after 600 ms — typing is never interrupted, mirroring the Prime mission). Photos go through the shared `compressImage(file,cb,max,q)` helper (downscaled JPEG data URL; `loadVisionImg` reuses it) and `rfSetPhoto`. **No audio** (text + photo only, by design). `MON_S` = short month names.
- **Persistent task header** (`.tv-head`): every Tasks view (and the Horizon page) shows a view name + a TickTick-style Filter·Sort·Group icon (`#tvSortBtn`/`#hzSortBtn` → shared `#taskFilterMenu` popover via `openTaskFilter(anchorId,{group,sort})`) + a ⋯ view-options icon. Tasks' ⋯ (`#tvViewMenu`) = list/kanban/timeline + kanban card size (`settings.kanbanSize` small/medium/big, default small) + show-calendar. Horizon's ⋯ (`#hzViewMenu`) = Columns/List layout + panes-shown (`settings.colsVisible`).
- `taskView` — current Tasks tab view: inbox/boards/matrix/dashboard + smart lists all/today/next7 (day/week/month/quarter/year/life/horizon are reachable only inside the Horizon page now; `migrateView` maps stale board/kanban/timeline/calendar/day/horizon → 'all'). Horizon-only sub-renders (`renderCarousel`/`renderDayList`/`renderPeriodView`/`horizonHTML`) call `renderTasks()`, which re-routes to `renderHorizonTab()` while the Horizon page is active.
- `settings.taskLayout` — 'columns' (TimeStripe-style scrollable period columns, default) or 'list'; toggled per time/horizon view. `colOffset` holds the per-view carousel page offset.
- **Full-width takeover**: `isWideView()` decides which views span the whole app (`.wrap.tasks-wide` hides the timer column). Wide = calendar + agenda/dashboard/matrix/timeline always, and day/week/month/quarter/year/horizon/boards in *columns* layout. Inbox & life stay in-panel. `applyTaskWidth()` toggles the class (called in `renderTasks` and on tab switch).
- **Context menus** (`openCtxMenu`): TimeStripe-style ⋯ menu with viewport-clamped flyout submenus (two layers: `#ctxMenu` root + `#ctxSub` flyout, so they never clip in the Notion iframe). `buildTaskMenu(t,re)` / `buildSubjectMenu(s)` define the items; top color-dot row sets task priority / subject colour. `calCursor` = month shown in calendar.
- `boards` — user-created kanban boards: `[{id,name,lists:[{id,name}],layout:'columns'|'list',created}]`. A task carries `boardId`/`listId` (dual placement — keeps its schedule too). `currentBoardId` = active board.
- `taskFilter` / `subjTaskFilter` — active filter: all/active/done
- **Task cards are flat** (no expanding panel): card shows priority dot · check · name · ⋯. There is no inline ▶ on task cards — running a timer for a task lives in the ⋯ menu (`buildTaskMenu`). All editing lives in the ⋯ menu too — clicking the name or ⋯ opens it. Rename is inline (`renameTask`); time-of-day, checklist, repeat, subject, board, schedule etc. are menu items/submenus.
- **Play buttons are mode-aware**: a task's Start (in the ⋯ menu) runs `startTaskTimer` (→ `startTaskStopwatch`/`startTaskPomodoro`); a subject's inline ▶ (Subjects page) runs `startSubjectTimer` (→ `quickStopwatch`/`startSubjectPomodoro`), each following the current timer `mode`. Menus offer both modes explicitly. These both bind **and** start immediately (unchanged); the timer-card focus picker (see "Task-first focus") only *selects* the target and leaves starting to the Start button.
- **TimeStripe free-add**: clicking empty space in a column body (`.ccol-body`) focuses that column's Add input (global pointerdown listener).
- **Task sound** has two voices via `_taskVia`: a bright snap on ＋/Add button-click, a deeper tock on Enter.
- `countdowns` — TickTick-style Countdown page cards: `[{id,name,emoji,date(YYYY-MM-DD),created}]`. Rides cloud sync (snapshot/applyRemote/save). `cdDays(date)` = `daysBetween(today,date)` (>0 future "Days until", <0 past "Days since", 0 "Today"). `renderCountdownTab()` renders the card grid; `+` (`#cdAddBtn`) and per-card ⋯ (Edit/Delete only — no style/notes/archive) drive `openCountdownEdit(c)` / `#ovCountdown` modal.
- `habits` — TickTick-style habit tracker: `[{id,name,emoji,color,freq:'daily'|'weekdays'|'weekly'|'interval',days:[0-6],perWeek,interval,goal,unit,checkType:'auto'|'all',step,goalDays(0=forever),section,checkStyle:'check'|'icon',log:{YYYY-MM-DD:n},notes:{YYYY-MM-DD:str},start,archived,created}]`. Rides cloud sync (all newer fields are optional, defaulted via `||` — no migration). **Own Habits page** (after Countdown) with two views switched in the ⋯ (`settings.habitView` = 'list' | 'calendar'): list = a top "Last 7 days" overall-completion ring strip + **collapsible sections** (Morning · Afternoon · Evening · Night · Others, ordered by `habitSectionsOf`; collapsed names in `settings.hbCollapsed`) of per-habit rows (today check + trailing-7 strip + streak), with the selected habit's detail (4 stat cards + month calendar + **Habit Log** check-in notes) alongside; calendar = per-section grid of per-habit month cards. `+`=`openHabitEdit`/`#ovHabit` modal (Frequency daily/weekdays/weekly/**Every N days**; Goal/day + unit; **When checking** Add-a-step/Complete-all + step, shown only when goal>1; **Duration** Forever/7/21/30/100/365; **Section**); per-habit ⋯ = Edit / **Checked-in style** (check⇄emoji) / Archive / Delete. Helpers: `habitDueOn(h,k)` (honours interval + `habitEndKey` challenge window), `habitDoneOn`/`habitPartOn`, `checkHabit(h,k)` (toggle, or step-increment/complete-all for amount goals), `habitStreak`, `habitsForDay`, `habitDurLabel`, `habitSection`, `habitTick`. **Habits surface elsewhere exactly like TickTick**: a today-only "Habits" section (`habitTodaySectionHTML()`, wired by `wireHabits`) injected into Today + Next 7 days + the Horizon Day section/column — never in All or Inbox; plus completion dots in the month calendar (`habitCellDotsHTML(k)`, today+past only). Any check-in goes through `afterHabitChange()` which re-renders whichever surface is showing.
- `CLOUD` — Firebase config object

## Key functions
- `save()` — persists all state to localStorage + triggers cloudSave()
- `normalizeData()` — ensures task shape, runs migration from legacy s.todos
- `renderSubjects()` — renders the Subjects tab (still shows each subject's tasks + inline "Add task…")
- `renderFocusHeader()` — fills the timer's `.focus-pick` header from `currentTask`/`currentHabit`/`$('activeSubject')`; `openFocusPicker()`/`renderFocusPicker()` drive the picker popover; `selectFocusTask`/`selectFocusSubject`/`selectFocusHabit`/`clearFocus` set the binding (selection only)
- `renderTasks()` — renders the Tasks tab (dispatches to board/matrix/timeline/list)
- `refreshTaskSurfaces()` — re-renders both tabs if visible (call after any task mutation)
- `applyFilter(list, mode)` — filters tasks by all/active/done/wontdo. The default **`all`** (working) branch drops `staleDone(t)` tasks so completed/abandoned clutter doesn't carry into the next day (TickTick-style); since nearly every view pool funnels through `applyFilter(...,taskFilter)`, this clears old completions across all views at once. The explicit **Completed**/**Won't Do** filters skip the stale drop and show the full archive (as do the Log/Stats, which read `tasks`/`doneOn` directly).
- `staleDone(t)` — a finished one-off task whose completion day has passed (`done`+`doneOn<today`, or `wontDo`+`wontDoOn<today`). Repeating tasks reset through `isTaskDone()` and are never stale. Used by `applyFilter`'s default branch + the Subjects-page done/won't groups (they build their own lists). Tasks completed *today* stay visible in the collapsed "✓ Completed" group; previous days' completions drop out of working views.
- `taskSort(a,b)` — sorts done tasks to bottom, then by priority/due
- `isTaskDone(t)` — respects repeat logic (daily/weekdays/weekly); also returns true for **"Won't Do"** tasks (`t.wontDo`), so abandoned tasks leave the active pool everywhere. `toggleWontDo(t)` abandons/reactivates (mutually exclusive with `done`); `renderTaskList` files them in a separate collapsed **"✗ Won't Do · N"** group (key `…·wd`) below Completed, the card shows a muted ✗ (`.tk-check.wd`), and the Show-tasks filter has a **Won't Do** segment (`applyFilter` mode `wontdo`; `done` excludes won't-do). App-only.
- `toggleTask(t)` — toggles done/doneOn respecting repeat
- `quadrant(t)` — returns 0-3 for Eisenhower matrix
- `gateAddTask(t, finalize)` — **the add-friction gate. Every MANUAL task creation must funnel through this** (`finalize()` does the `tasks.push`+`save`+re-render and only runs once the gate clears). Off when `settings.frictionOn===false` — short-circuits straight to `finalize`. Otherwise it enforces: a window check (`settings.addWindows`, editable in Settings → Task discipline), a daily cap (`settings.maxTasksPerDay`, default 7; `manualTasksToday()` counts tasks created today in IST), then the **friction modal** (`#ovFriction`, content built in JS): require priority OR due OR estimated-time, ask "Why does this matter today?" (placeholder hint, stored on `t.why`), and a spoken-oath step ("I will … by … because …"). `canAddNow()` runs just the cheap window+cap gates (used by `duplicateTask`/`addSubtask`, which skip the why/oath). The two `normalizeData` migrations push directly and are exempt by design.
- `duplicateTask(t)` — clones a task (fresh id, reset done/checklist), inserts right after the original; `canAddNow()`-gated (counts toward the daily cap + window)
- `taskSound()` — mechanical "tock" via WebAudio on task creation (called inside `newTask()`; respects `settings.taskSound`, default on)
- `calendarHTML()` / `wireCalendar()` — month-grid calendar view: simple chips with hover-+ add, ⋯ for full menu, drag a chip to another day to reschedule
- `applyTheme()` — applies saved theme to html element
- `pollCloud()` — pulls remote changes (runs every 15s and on tab refocus)
- `snapshot()` — returns full state object with _updatedAt timestamp
- `FD` — global debug object: FD.state, FD.render(), FD.pull(), FD.reset()

## Task object shape
```json
{
  "id": "t...",
  "name": "string",
  "desc": "free-text description / notes",
  "subjectIds": ["s0", "s3"],
  "subjectId": "s0",
  "due": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "dueEnd": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "priority": 0,
  "checklist": [{"id":"c...","text":"string","done":false}],
  "done": false,
  "doneOn": "",
  "wontDo": false,
  "wontDoOn": "",
  "repeat": "none|daily|weekdays|weekly|monthly|quarterly|yearly",
  "start": "HH:MM",
  "dur": 0,
  "horizon": "''|day|week|month|quarter|year|life",
  "hkey": "period key for week/month/quarter/year",
  "parentId": "goal-tree link",
  "boardId": "", "listId": "",
  "created": 1234567890
}
```
Repeat can't be finer than the task's horizon (`repeatOptsFor`/`clampRepeat`); time-of-day (`start`/`dur`) only applies to day-level tasks. Scheduling is set via the TimeStripe-style date picker (`openDatePicker`), not raw inputs.

## Views in the Tasks tab
- **day / week / month / quarter / year** — TimeStripe-style scrollable period columns by default (`renderCarousel`); each has a Columns⇄List toggle (`settings.taskLayout`) and a ‹Today› pager. List mode falls back to `renderPeriodView` (day list mode = today's tasks).
- **life / inbox** — flat lists (always in-panel, never full-width)
- **calendar** — TimeStripe-style month grid (`calendarHTML`/`wireCalendar`): Life/Year/Month horizon cards on top, day cells below with chips; hover-+ to add, ⋯ menu per chip, drag chips between days. Always full-width.
- **horizon** — broad→narrow horizons; stacked sections (`horizonHTML`) or columns (`horizonColsHTML`) via the layout toggle
- **boards** — user kanban boards (`boardsHTML`/`wireBoards`): board tabs, per-board lists, list/column layout, drag tasks between lists
- **board** — the date-kanban "Agenda": Overdue, Today, Next 7 days, Inbox
- **matrix** — its own page (`#tab-matrix`), two interchangeable kinds (`settings.matrixKind` eisenhower⇄impact, toggled by the visible header switch). Eisenhower = Important×Urgent (Important = priority ≥ 2; Urgent = due today/overdue or within `settings.urgentDays` days); Impact = Productive×Attractive. **Moving a card between quadrants rewrites the properties that quadrant stands for** via `_matrixApplyDrop(t,qEl)` (Eisenhower → priority + due date; Impact → `t.impact`). Drag uses the pointer-gesture engine (`_startMatrixGesture`, mirroring `wireTaskGestures`) so it works on touch too — mouse drags immediately, touch long-presses to arm; tap/long-press opens the task ⋯ menu. Cards are intentionally plain (no drag-handle dots).
- **timeline** — Gantt chart. Drag bar to reschedule, drag right edge to extend span. Split into To-do / Done sections.

## Coding conventions
- Use `$('id')` for getElementById
- Use `esc(str)` for HTML-escaping user content
- Use `uid('prefix')` for generating unique IDs
- Use `todayKey()` for today's date in IST
- Use `addDays(key, n)` for date arithmetic
- Use `to12(hhmm)` for displaying times (12h format)
- Template literals for HTML generation — no innerHTML with string concat
- Never use `sudo npm` or any package manager — no dependencies

## Debug
Open browser console and type `FD`:
- `FD.state` — live data snapshot
- `FD.render()` — force re-render all surfaces
- `FD.pull()` — manually trigger cloud poll
- `FD.reset()` — wipe localStorage and reload (destructive)
- `FD.version` — current version string
