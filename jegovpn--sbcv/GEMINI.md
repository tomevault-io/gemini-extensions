# SBC Agents Guide

SBC is a sing-box configuration builder. The product goal is a React Flow visual editor backed by a canonical sing-box JSON/domain model.

## Source Of Truth

Read these before changing product behavior, schema, validation, or node UI:

- [SBC React Flow R&D Plan](docs/sbc-react-flow-rd-plan.md)
- [sing-box Config Document Inventory](docs/sing-box-config-doc-inventory.md)
- [sing-box Canvas Configuration Guide](docs/sing-box-canvas-configuration-guide.md)
- [sing-box Config Capability Audit](docs/sing-box-config-capability-audit.md)
- [Goal-Driven Development](docs/goal-driven-development.md)
- `vercel-react-best-practices` skill when writing, reviewing, or refactoring React/Next.js code.

The canvas is never the config source file. `SingBoxConfig` / domain model is the source of truth; React Flow nodes and edges are a derived editing view.

## Non-Negotiables

1. **Canonical config first**: all edits go through domain commands that update canonical JSON/domain state. Do not derive final `config.json` from React Flow node data.
2. **stable-first**: default templates, export, fixtures, and blocking validation target sing-box stable. testing is explicit opt-in.
3. **Different binaries**: stable configs are checked with `sing-box-stable`; testing configs are checked with `sing-box-testing`.
4. **Document traceability**: every schema field, node type, Inspector field, and fixture must map to an entry in `docs/sing-box-config-doc-inventory.md`.
5. **Rules are ordered tables**: `route.rules` and `dns.rules` are ordered lists. The canvas may visualize references, but it must not be the ordering source.
6. **Tag references are explicit**: tag rename, delete, connect, and disconnect must update references through tested domain commands.
7. **Signed commits only**: commits must be signed and pass this repo's `pre-push` signature verification.
8. **Small atomics**: one concern per commit. Prefer changes under 400 logical lines; split larger work.
9. **No silent validation gaps**: if `sing-box check` cannot run, state that clearly in the final answer and keep schema/semantic validation separate from official validation.
10. **No unrelated cleanup**: do not refactor unrelated files while implementing a goal.
11. **React performance discipline**: frontend implementation and review must apply the `vercel-react-best-practices` skill, especially bundle size, rerender control, and async/data waterfall avoidance.

## Frontend Skill Gate

Any change that touches frontend implementation, frontend architecture, UI tests, or frontend review must use the `vercel-react-best-practices` skill in that same work session.

This is a hard gate for files such as `src/**/*.tsx`, `src/**/*.ts` used by UI state/rendering, `src/styles.css`, React Flow canvas code, component tests, Playwright UI tests, and build/bundle configuration.

Before editing frontend code:

- load/read the `vercel-react-best-practices` skill;
- identify the frontend-specific performance risks for the atomic, especially bundle size, rerender scope, expensive derived state, and async/data waterfalls;
- keep transient hover/drag/canvas interaction state out of broad canonical config subscriptions.

Before marking frontend work reviewed or done:

- explicitly review the diff against `vercel-react-best-practices`;
- verify heavy editors or optional panels are deferred where practical;
- prefer narrow Zustand/selectors and memoized derived graph data over broad rerender paths;
- record any intentional deviation in the goal doc or final milestone report.

## Development Protocol

Before editing:

- Read this file and the relevant docs above.
- Identify the active goal or task.
- Define the atomic scope: files allowed, expected behavior, tests/checks.
- Check current worktree state with `git status --short --branch`.

During implementation:

- Keep config/domain logic separate from canvas layout.
- Add or update docs when behavior, schema, or validation policy changes.
- Prefer registry-driven node/schema/form additions over ad hoc component branching.
- For React/Next code, apply `vercel-react-best-practices`: direct imports, lazy-load heavy editors, avoid broad state subscriptions, memoize expensive derived graph work, and keep frequent canvas hover/drag state out of global rerender paths.
- Preserve existing user changes; never discard unrelated work.

Before committing:

- Run `git diff --check`.
- Run available project tests/checks. If the project has no test harness yet, say so.
- For config fixtures, run the matching `sing-box-stable check` or `sing-box-testing check` once binaries are available.
- Inspect the diff for scope creep.

After committing:

- For PR work, push the branch and open the PR immediately after local checks and signed commit verification pass.
- Do not wait on unreliable GitHub Actions before opening or advancing a PR. Prefer local required checks, local E2E/smoke verification, signed commit verification, and relevant provider deployment status.
- After opening a PR, immediately check for the Claude review issue for that PR. If the scheduled poller has not created it yet, record that and continue; do not run a duplicate local poller unless the user explicitly asks.
- Resolve actionable Claude review issues for the active goal before merging or starting another product atomic. Review issues with only timeout/pass/no-finding output may be closed as non-actionable with a short comment.
- Push to `origin main` after merge unless the user asks otherwise. Use `SBC_SKIP_CLAUDE_REVIEW=1 git push origin main` when the PR already has a review issue; this keeps signature verification while avoiding duplicate local Claude review.
- Verify the pushed commit is GitHub Verified when GitHub access is available.
- Run the post-merge GitHub issue gate before the next atomic PR: list open issues, resolve actionable Claude Code review issues for the active goal, and record unrelated/blocked/unavailable cases.

## Autonomous `/goal` Execution

A `/goal` should be one line:

```txt
/goal <target outcome> --spec <docs/path.md>
```

The method lives here:

1. Read the spec path, this guide, and the source-of-truth docs.
2. Create or update a goal R&D doc under `docs/goals/` for the full end-to-end path.
3. Define the optimal path: architecture choice, implementation order, review gate, E2E gate, and done definition.
4. Break the goal into 1-3 near-term atomics; do not pre-plan a long queue.
5. Implement one atomic at a time.
6. Run checks, commit signed, push, verify.
7. After merge or push to `main`, run the post-merge GitHub issue gate before starting the next atomic.
8. Review the implementation against the goal doc and source-of-truth docs.
9. Run E2E or smoke verification that proves the user-facing outcome works.
10. Record deviations from the spec in the goal R&D doc.
11. Continue until the goal is complete or a real blocker appears.

A goal is not complete just because code was written. It is complete only when the researched approach, implementation, review, E2E verification, docs, and signed push are all done or explicitly marked not applicable with a reason.

Stop and ask the user before:

- changing the product source-of-truth model away from canonical JSON/domain state;
- deleting user data, secrets, or irreversible project history;
- bypassing stable validation;
- making a direction decision not settled by the spec;
- adding a dependency that materially changes the stack.

At each milestone, report:

- what changed;
- checks run and their result;
- review/E2E status;
- GitHub issue-gate result after merge/push to `main`;
- known deviations or unresolved risks;
- the next atomic.
