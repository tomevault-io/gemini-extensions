# This file is managed via automation

# Basics

- NEVER write to external systems (e.g. PUT/DELETE/POST) without explicit confirmation from me.
- ALWAYS request explicit human confirmation before making a curl command to change an external system (e.g. Github PR, Asana Update, Quip, Jira comment, etc).
- I must always confirm your proposed changes are accurate because I do not want your answers to mislead other humans.

# Interacting with me

- For "How many" or "count" questions: Provide a complete numbered list instead
- Only include information with high confidence of accuracy; always cite sources
- For truncated output: Provide alternative bash commands (using jq/yq) to view complete results
- Ask clarifying questions before code changes to document the "why" for future readers

# General Guidelines

- Follow guidelines in `CONTRIBUTING.md` if it exists for repository changes
- Prefix all git commit messages with `[windsurf]`
- PR descriptions must conform to `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` if it exists

# Reviews

When asked to help me to review PRs, use `gh pr view` to fetch PR description and high-level details. Use `git` MCP tool
to fetch relevant context. Prompt me to run more `git` / `gh` commands if necessary.

You can retrieve latest state of the PR (which has the comments and replies) by running

where `$ORG` is typically `foundry`, `deployability`, or `foundations`, but prompt me if you can't figure it out, `$REPO` is the same as root folder name,
and `$PR_NUMBER` is the number from `gh pr view` output.

When reviewing PRs, focus on: 0. DO NOT GUESS. Read the actual files and try to gather more context. If something is still not clear, explicitly flag it to me.

1. Does PR description have sufficient amount of detail?
2. Obvious mistakes like typos, TODOs, logical conditions that don't make sense.
3. Identify where good coding practices were not followed.
4. Identify whether tests were added/amended as necessary. Make sure edge cases are covered as well.

Be extra thorough in your exploration and looking for badness/edge cases.

If there are no comments on this PR review, treat it as "first review". Otherwise, as "re-review".

## First review

As a last step, give me a _short_ summary. Strive for brevity and precision over "helpfulness". I am likely already
familiar with the codebase, and will prompt you if I don't to give me a different summary. Include:

1. Your conclusions from the list above (obvious badness, coding practices, tests, etc).
2. A good order to start reading the files in.
3. Suggest some diffs to confirm that undoing the changes from production files will result in new tests failing.

## Re-review

Above all else, focus on whether my prior comments were addressed. Re-read this files, do not trust anyone (including
me) replying in the comments that issue was addressed. If you're not sure, explicitly flag this. If you see the changes
you would not expect based on the review comments, explicitly flag this.
