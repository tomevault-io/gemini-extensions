# khive — Agent Usage Guide

This file is for AI agents (and the humans configuring them) using khive as the research runtime.

khive gives your agent three things:

1. **A knowledge graph** — typed entities + edges you build as you work
2. **Notes** — observations, insights, questions, decisions, references that persist across sessions
3. **Pattern matching queries** — GQL/SPARQL traverse over the graph

If you're working on khive itself (writing code in this repo), see `CLAUDE.md` instead.

## Core verbs

All verbs are available via MCP ([ADR-023](docs/adr/ADR-023-verb-consolidated-mcp-surface.md)).

| Verb        | What it does                                     | When to use                                              |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `create`    | Add an entity or note                            | New concept, paper, observation, decision worth tracking |
| `get`       | Fetch any record by UUID (auto-detects type)     | When you have a UUID and need the full record            |
| `search`    | Text + semantic search over entities or notes    | Finding things by content similarity                     |
| `list`      | Structured filtering (by kind, tags, etc.)       | Browsing a category or namespace                         |
| `update`    | Patch properties, tags, or content (by UUID)     | Correcting or enriching an existing record               |
| `delete`    | Soft-delete (or hard-delete) a record (by UUID)  | Removing stale or incorrect data                         |
| `link`      | Connect two nodes with a typed relation          | When relationships emerge from research                  |
| `traverse`  | Multi-hop graph walk with depth/relation filters | Structural context — lineages, paths, clusters           |
| `neighbors` | Immediate neighbors of a node                    | "What connects to this entity?"                          |
| `query`     | GQL/SPARQL query string → SQL                    | Complex pattern matching over the graph                  |
| `merge`     | Deduplicate two entities into one (v0.1)         | "LoRA" and "Low-Rank Adaptation" are the same concept    |

**11 tools in v0.1.** `get`, `update`, `delete` are UUID-only — they auto-detect whether the
record is an entity, note, or edge. `create`, `list`, `search` require `kind=entity|note` (or
`kind=edge` for `list`).

**Deferred (not available in v0.1):** `supersede` (use `link(..., relation="supersedes")` as a
workaround), `request` (batch DSL), note merge (only entity merge is implemented).

### Notes vs entities

- **Entities** = things in the world: concepts, papers, people, projects, datasets, orgs.
  Graph nodes with typed edges between them.
- **Notes** = your observations about the world: what you noticed, concluded, decided, asked, cited.
  Temporal records with salience and optional graph edges (via `annotates`).

Use `create(kind="entity", entity_kind="concept", ...)` for entities.
Use `create(kind="note", note_kind="observation", ...)` for notes.

---

## The 6 entity kinds (closed set — [ADR-001](docs/adr/ADR-001-entity-kind-taxonomy.md))

| Kind       | What it represents                                      |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `concept`  | Algorithms, techniques, architectures, theories, models |
| `document` | Papers, preprints, technical reports, blog posts, books |
| `dataset`  | Benchmarks, corpora, evaluation sets                    |
| `project`  | Codebases, libraries, tools, frameworks                 |
| `person`   | Researchers, engineers, authors                         |
| `org`      | Labs, companies, institutions                           |

`concept` is the default. Use `properties` for finer distinctions (`type: "paper"`,
`domain: "attention"`, `status: "implemented"`).

---

## The 5 note kinds (closed set — [ADR-019](docs/adr/ADR-019-note-kind-taxonomy.md))

| Kind          | What it records                               |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `observation` | An empirical capture — what you noticed       |
| `insight`     | A synthetic conclusion from observations      |
| `question`    | An open inquiry or research direction         |
| `decision`    | A committed choice with rationale             |
| `reference`   | An external pointer with context (paper, URL) |

`observation` is the default. Notes can annotate entities via `create(kind="note",
annotates=[entity_id], ...)`.

---

## The 13-relation ontology (closed set — [ADR-002](docs/adr/ADR-002-edge-ontology.md))

When you `link` nodes, use ONLY these relations:

### Structure

- `contains` — parent → child (system contains module)
- `part_of` — inverse of contains
- `instance_of` — specific is a case of general

### Derivation

- `extends` — child builds on parent (Flash Causal extends Flash Tiled)
- `variant_of` — A is a modified version of B (QLoRA variant_of LoRA)
- `introduced_by` — concept first described in paper/by person
- `supersedes` — new replaces old entirely

### Dependency

- `depends_on` — consumer needs dependency at runtime/build
- `enables` — prerequisite makes outcome possible

### Implementation

- `implements` — code realizes algorithm/concept

### Lateral

- `competes_with` — alternative approaches
- `composed_with` — used together in a system

### Annotation

- `annotates` — a note observes/comments on an entity (or another note)

**Why closed**: a sparse ontology stays queryable. Ad-hoc relations (`uses`, `related_to`,
`loaded_by`) fragment the graph and make traversal useless. If your relationship doesn't fit, it's
probably a property on the entity, not an edge.

---

## Tool schemas (required → **bold**, optional → normal)

| Tool        | Fields                                                                                                                                               | Example                                                      |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `create`    | **kind** (entity\|note), **name** + **entity_kind** for entity, **content** + note_kind for note; description, properties, tags, salience, annotates | `{"kind":"entity","entity_kind":"concept","name":"LoRA"}`    |
| `get`       | **id** (UUID); namespace                                                                                                                             | `{"id":"<uuid>"}`                                            |
| `list`      | **kind** (entity\|edge\|note); entity_kind, note_kind, source_id, target_id, relations, min_weight, max_weight, limit                                | `{"kind":"entity","entity_kind":"concept","limit":20}`       |
| `update`    | **id** (UUID); name, description, properties, tags (entity), relation, weight (edge); namespace                                                      | `{"id":"<uuid>","description":"Updated desc"}`               |
| `delete`    | **id** (UUID); hard (default: false); namespace                                                                                                      | `{"id":"<uuid>","hard":true}`                                |
| `merge`     | **into_id**, **from_id**; strategy (prefer_into\|prefer_from\|union); namespace                                                                      | `{"into_id":"<uuid>","from_id":"<uuid>"}`                    |
| `search`    | **kind** (entity\|note), **query** (text); limit; namespace                                                                                          | `{"kind":"entity","query":"attention mechanism"}`            |
| `link`      | **source_id**, **target_id**, **relation**; weight (0.0–1.0); namespace                                                                              | `{"source_id":"<A>","target_id":"<B>","relation":"extends"}` |
| `neighbors` | **node_id**; direction (out\|in\|both), relations, limit; namespace                                                                                  | `{"node_id":"<uuid>","direction":"in"}`                      |
| `traverse`  | **roots** (UUID list); max_depth, direction, relations, include_roots; namespace                                                                     | `{"roots":["<uuid>"],"max_depth":2}`                         |
| `query`     | **query** (GQL or SPARQL string); namespace                                                                                                          | `{"query":"MATCH (a:concept)-[:extends]->(b) RETURN a"}`     |

### When to use which retrieval verb

- **`get(id)`** — you have a UUID, fetch the record (any type)
- **`search(kind, query)`** — text similarity: "find things _about_ X"
- **`list(kind, filters)`** — structured browse: "all concepts" / "edges from node A"
- **`neighbors(node_id)`** — one-hop graph: "what connects to X?"
- **`traverse(roots)`** — multi-hop graph: "reachability within N hops"
- **`query(gql)`** — pattern matching: "concepts that extend something introduced by a paper"

### v0.1 workaround: supersession via edges

Until `supersede` lands, manually create a supersedes edge:

```
link(source_id=new_note, target_id=old_note, relation="supersedes")
```

`search(kind="note")` already excludes notes targeted by a `supersedes` edge.

---

## Research workflow pattern

```
1. search(kind="note", query="topic I'm investigating")
   → see what you already know

2. search(kind="entity", query="FlashAttention")
   → check what's already in the graph

3. For new concepts:
   create(kind="entity", entity_kind="concept", name="...", properties={...})

4. For relationships:
   link(source=A, target=B, relation="extends")

5. For observations/insights:
   create(kind="note", note_kind="observation", content="...", annotates=[entity_id])

6. For structural queries:
   traverse(roots=[entity_id], max_depth=3, relations=["extends", "variant_of"])
```

---

## Entity naming conventions

- **Short canonical names**, not full titles: `LoRA` not
  `Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models`
- **Papers**: entity name = short name (`Sinkhorn Distances`). Full title, authors, year, arxiv ID
  in `properties`
- **Algorithms**: the name people actually say: `GQA`, `RoPE`, `FlashAttention`
- **No prefixes/suffixes**: `Speculative Decoding` not `Speculative Decoding (concept)`

---

## Property conventions

Use these canonical property keys when applicable:

| Key       | Values                                                                                     | Purpose                          |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| `type`    | `paper`, `algorithm`, `technique`, `architecture`, `model`, `benchmark`, `dataset`, `tool` | Finer classification than `kind` |
| `domain`  | `attention`, `inference`, `training`, `fine-tuning`, `optimal-transport`, etc.             | Research area                    |
| `status`  | `concept`, `researched`, `prototyped`, `implemented`, `shipped`, `deprecated`              | Maturity                         |
| `source`  | `arxiv:2106.09685` or DOI/URL                                                              | Citation pointer                 |
| `summary` | One-paragraph description                                                                  | Human-readable explanation       |

For papers also include: `title`, `authors`, `year`.

---

## Edge density rules

Sparse graphs are useless. Every entity should have minimum edges:

| Entity kind                | Min edges | Required relations                                                                                                       |
| -------------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `concept` (algorithm)      | 4         | `instance_of` or `extends` (at least one parent), `introduced_by` if paper exists, `competes_with` if alternatives exist |
| `concept` (paper)          | 2         | `introduced_by` from concepts it introduced                                                                              |
| `project` (implementation) | 3         | `contains` or `part_of`, `implements` (what concept), `depends_on`                                                       |
| `person`                   | 1         | `introduced_by` from their work                                                                                          |

**Target**: 5+ edges per entity average. Below 3 = polish needed.

---

## GQL traverse examples

```gql
# What does LoRA derive from / what derives from LoRA?
MATCH (a)-[:extends|variant_of*1..3]->(b {name: 'LoRA'}) RETURN a, b

# Find all papers in the attention domain
MATCH (a:concept) WHERE a.domain = 'attention' AND a.type = 'paper' RETURN a

# What concepts does this implementation realize?
MATCH ({name: 'lattice-inference'})-[:implements]->(c:concept) RETURN c

# Multi-hop lineage: from a paper to current implementations
MATCH (p:concept)<-[:introduced_by]-(c)<-[:implements]-(impl)
WHERE p.name = 'Attention Is All You Need'
RETURN c, impl
```

## SPARQL traverse examples

```sparql
# Same as first GQL example, SPARQL syntax
SELECT ?a ?b WHERE { ?a :extends+ ?b . ?b :name 'LoRA' . } LIMIT 10

# Find concepts in a specific domain
SELECT ?a WHERE { ?a a :concept . ?a :domain 'attention' . } LIMIT 20
```

Both syntaxes compile to the same SQL. Use whichever is natural.

---

## Self-expansion: let the graph grow with your work

khive isn't a passive database — it's designed for the graph to grow as you research:

- **Extract**: feed papers in, entities + edges fall out automatically
- **Gap detection**: traverse finds structural holes — "these clusters should connect"
- **Frontier discovery**: identify leaf nodes worth exploring next
- **Annotate**: notes attach observations to entities, creating cross-substrate navigation

Don't think of yourself as a curator. Think of yourself as a researcher whose work happens to leave
structural traces.

## Common mistakes

| Mistake                                           | Why it's wrong                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Storing findings only as notes, never as entities | Notes are for context; entities are for structure  |
| Creating duplicate entities                       | Always `search` first — link to existing if found  |
| Using ad-hoc relations                            | Map to the closed 13-relation set or don't link    |
| Reversed `introduced_by` direction                | concept → paper (the paper introduces the concept) |
| One-hop neighbor queries when you need lineage    | Use `traverse` with `max_depth` for multi-hop      |
| Adding `version`/`date` to entity names           | Those are properties, not names                    |

---

## AI-assisted contribution policy

If you are an AI agent authoring PRs, issues, or comments via someone's CLI:

1. **Attribution**: start the body with a blockquote attribution line:
   `> _PR description authored by Claude (Anthropic agent) on behalf of @<handle>._`
2. **Verify claims**: every claim in your PR description must match the actual diff.
3. **Test evidence**: include `cargo test` output for behavior-changing code.
4. **ADR awareness**: link to relevant ADRs. Schema/interface changes require an ADR first.
