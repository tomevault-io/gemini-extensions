Role-based guidance for AI agents working in this repository.

MONAI Physio is a collection of methods, workflows, tutorials, and CLI tools
for creating personalized physiological digital twins: starting from a 3D
medical image of a subject, extracting anatomic models, and then using AI
surrogates to estimate the subject's physiological processes (initially
cardiac and respiratory motion, expanding to electrophysiology, blood flow,
and organ perfusion). It is an **early-alpha** scientific Python library.
Clarity beats premature optimization. Prefer compatibility: break a public API
only when the change is generally beneficial to future users, and record every
break in the migration guide (see below).

## Role

We are developing open-source code for scientific AI libraries.

**A GPU is assumed.** Supporting CPU-only machines is not a requirement.
Design for the GPU first and use it wherever it is faster - do not add CPU
fallbacks, dtype compromises, or size limits to keep a CPU-only path viable,
and do not weaken an algorithm because a CPU could not run it.

It follows that tests and tutorials may require a GPU. Mark those that do with
`@pytest.mark.requires_gpu` so the bucket stays honest, but do not contort a
test to avoid the marker.

## Priorities

1. Accuracy.
2. Clarity, maintainability, and simplicity.
3. Consistency with the rest of the platform and open-source standards.
4. Documentation.
5. Testing.

## Behavior

1. Do not assume. Do not hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.
2. Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.
3. Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.
4. Define success criteria. Loop until verified.

## Developer Tool Prerequisites

Non-Python tools used by contributor workflows:

- **Codex CLI** (`codex`) - can run the `.agents/` slash skills and is the
  default PR-review agent for `ai_agent_github_reviews.py`.
- **Claude Code CLI** (`claude`) - can run the `.agents/` slash skills and
  `ai_agent_github_reviews.py --agent claude`.
  Install: `winget install Anthropic.ClaudeCode`.
- **gh CLI** (`gh`) - required by `ai_agent_github_reviews.py` to fetch PR
  review data. Install: `winget install GitHub.cli` then `gh auth login`.
  Not installable via pip/uv; it is a compiled Go binary.

## Common Commands

Prefer the repository-local virtual environment at `.\venv` or `..\venv`. Activate it
before issuing Python commands so `python`, console scripts, and `uv pip` all use that
environment. If activation is not possible, invoke
`.\venv\Scripts\python.exe -m ...` directly. Use `uv run ...` only when the
local `venv` is unavailable and you need uv to create or sync an environment.

```powershell
# Create the repo-local environment if it does not already exist
uv venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Install in editable mode
uv pip install -e .

# Lint and format
python -m ruff check . --fix && python -m ruff format .

# Type checking
python -m mypy src/ tests/

# All pre-commit hooks
python -m pre_commit run --all-files

# Fast tests
python -m pytest tests/ -v

# Single test file or test by name
python -m pytest tests/test_contour_tools.py -v
python -m pytest tests/test_contour_tools.py::test_extract_surface -v

# Opt-in test buckets
python -m pytest tests/ -v --run-slow
python -m pytest tests/ -v --run-gpu
python -m pytest tests/ -v --run-simpleware
python -m pytest tests/ -v --run-physicsnemo
python -m pytest tests/ -v --run-tutorials

# Enable every bucket at once (equivalent to passing all --run-* flags)
python -m pytest tests/ -v --run-all

# Typical local GPU profile
python -m pytest tests/ -v --run-gpu --run-slow

# Coverage
python -m pytest tests/ --cov=src/monai_physio --cov-report=html

# Create missing baselines
python -m pytest tests/ --create-baselines
```

Version bumping: `bumpver update --patch`, `--minor`, or `--major`.

## Migration Guide

MONAI Physio prefers compatibility. Break a public API only when the change is
generally beneficial to future users. Never add deprecation shims,
removed-symbol re-exports, or removed-symbol stubs; when a break is
substantial, ship code that automates the conversion instead.

At commit time: if the diff breaks a public API, append an entry to
`docs/developer/migration_next.md` in that same commit - what changed, why it
benefits future users, before/after code, and the conversion script (or
`None needed`). Follow the entry template at the bottom of that file.

At release time:

```bash
bumpver update --patch
git mv docs/developer/migration_next.md docs/developer/migration_<new_version>.md
# retitle the archived file to "Migration Guide - <new_version>"
# recreate docs/developer/migration_next.md from its entry template
```

The `Developer Guides` toctree in `docs/index.rst` globs
`developer/migration_*`, so archived guides need no further wiring.

## graphify

This project keeps a knowledge graph at `graphify-out/` covering god nodes,
community structure, and cross-file relationships. It is the recommended way
to navigate the codebase with an AI assistant: a scoped subgraph is far
smaller and more accurate than raw grep output over 8,000+ lines of source.

```bash
graphify query "<question>"     # codebase questions -> scoped subgraph
graphify path "<A>" "<B>"       # how two symbols relate
graphify explain "<concept>"    # focused explanation of one concept
graphify update .               # refresh after code changes (AST-only, no API cost)
```

- Prefer `graphify query` over manual searching when `graphify-out/graph.json`
  exists.
- Use `graphify-out/wiki/index.md` for broad navigation, and
  `graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md` only for whole-architecture review.
- Run `graphify update .` after modifying code so the graph does not go stale.

## Codex Sandbox

- If a Python command fails with
  `No Python at ...`
  do not assume Python is missing. The sandbox can break the launcher or venv path.
- Use the local virtual environment instead: `.\venv`, `..\venv`, `.\.venv`, `..\.venv`
- Run that venv outside the sandbox when needed. Treat this as an
  environment/sandbox workaround, not a dependency or installation problem.

## Universal Rules

- Read the relevant source files before proposing changes.
- Runtime classes for workflows, segmentation, registration, and USD tools
  inherit from `MONAIPhysioBase`; new runtime classes must too. Standalone
  utility scripts and data/container/helper classes do not.
- In classes that inherit from `MONAIPhysioBase`, use `self.log_info()` and
  `self.log_debug()`, never `print()`. Standalone scripts may use `print()`.
- No emojis in `.py` files; avoid them in docs too. Windows cp1252 encoding
  has broken this project before.
- The public VTK→USD entry point is `ConvertVTKToUSD`. Experiments, CLIs,
  tests, and tutorials must use it. Do not import from the `vtk_to_usd/`
  subpackage directly outside of `convert_vtk_to_usd.py` and the subpackage
  itself.
- Scripts that instantiate `SegmentChestTotalSegmentator` must guard the
  top-level invocation with `if __name__ == "__main__":` on Windows
  (`torch.multiprocessing` requires it).
- When fixing a bug, fix it. Don't add a comment recording what was wrong,
  what changed, or how it was diagnosed - that belongs in the commit message
  or PR description, not the code. Only record it in a comment when the
  motivation is truly exceptional: a non-obvious constraint or gotcha a
  future editor would otherwise reintroduce.
- Double quotes for strings and docstrings. Keep lines at or
  below 88 characters.
- Full type hints are required under strict mypy. Use `Optional[X]`, not
  `X | None`.
- Run `python -m pytest tests/ -v` from the active virtual venv to verify changes.
  Slow, GPU, Simpleware,
  and tutorial tests are auto-skipped unless their opt-in flag is
  passed.
- Do not run pytest with `--run-slow` or `--run-all` unless the user explicitly
  asks; those runs take far too long for an interactive session. Default to the
  fast suite and leave the opt-in buckets for the user to invoke.
- Query the graphify knowledge graph (`graphify query "<question>"`) to locate
  classes, methods, and signatures before searching manually.
- Do not commit changes or make pull requests unless specifically told to do so.

## Data Conventions

- Images are `itk.Image` objects with axes X, Y, Z [, T] in LPS world space.
  `itk.imread` normalizes DICOM, NIfTI, MHA, and NRRD inputs to LPS. Persist
  images with `itk.imwrite(..., compression=True)`.
- 4D time series use shape `(X, Y, Z, T)`. Never silently squeeze or permute
  axes.
- Surfaces are `pv.PolyData` in LPS, inherited from the source `itk.Image` via
  `itk.vtk_image_from_image`.
- Convert surfaces to USD right-handed Y-up only at USD export by
  `vtk_to_usd.lps_points_to_usd`:
  USD `+X=Left`, `+Y=Superior`, `+Z=Anterior`.
- Labelmaps are ITK images with integer labels. Keep anatomy group IDs consistent
  across segmenters.
- Masks are binary ITK images.
- Transforms are ITK composite transforms stored in compressed `.hdf` files.
- These conventions are fixed and hold everywhere. This section is their single
  source of truth - do not restate them in docstrings, comments, or test
  docstrings. Document only genuine deviations, such as a raw NumPy array whose
  axes are reversed relative to the ITK image it came from.

## Implementation Role

- Summarize current behavior in 2-4 sentences before editing.
- Identify success criteria or metrics.
- Refer to `*_tools.py` files for commonly used routines.
- Refer to `workspace/reference_code`, when available, for third-party library
  usage.
- Propose a numbered plan; confirm before implementing non-trivial structural
  changes.
- Keep diffs small and reviewable.
- Prefer editing existing modules over creating new ones.
- No deprecation shims, removed-symbol re-exports, or removed-symbol stubs.
  Change the code, log the break in `docs/developer/migration_next.md`, and
  provide a conversion script when the change is substantial.

## Testing Role

- Strongly prefer real downloaded test data over synthetic data. Request the
  session fixtures `test_directories`, `download_test_data`, and `test_images`
  so standard datasets are fetched automatically on first use.
- Real data exercises preprocessing, resampling, dtype handling, and
  world-frame metadata paths that synthetic toy volumes silently bypass.
- Only fall back to synthetic `itk.Image` or `pv.PolyData` inputs when the
  behavior under test is a pure unit such as axis arithmetic or dict routing,
  or when real data would push the test into a slow, GPU, or Simpleware bucket
  that does not fit the test's purpose. Keep synthetic volumes at or below 64
  voxels per side and say so in the docstring.
- Do not restate ITK shape, axis order, or world frame in test docstrings -
  those are fixed conventions (see Data Conventions above). State only what is
  specific to the test, such as the size of a synthetic volume.
- When a test produces an image or surface, compare against a baseline using
  `src/monai_physio/process_tests.py` utilities such as `ProcessTests`.
- Store baselines under `tests/baselines/`, which is tracked by Git LFS. Run
  `git lfs pull` after cloning.
- Run with `--create-baselines` to materialize missing baselines on first use.
- `tests/conftest.py` owns session-scoped fixtures that chain download,
  convert, segment, and register.
- Mark tests that need a GPU, a slow runtime, or a licensed Simpleware install
  with `@pytest.mark.requires_gpu`, `@pytest.mark.slow`, or
  `@pytest.mark.requires_simpleware`.
- Mark tutorial tests with `@pytest.mark.tutorial`.
- Tests that just need downloadable data need no marker; the fixture chain
  handles it.
- Prefer images from `ROOT/data/test/slicer_heart_small` for tests.
- Prefer storing test results in subdirectories under `./results/<test_name>`.

## Documentation Role

- Update docstrings for every changed public method. Keep claims factual.
- Document with docstrings and inline comments.
- Do not restate the fixed ITK shape, axis-order, or LPS conventions in
  docstrings. Document only genuine deviations, such as a raw NumPy array whose
  axes are reversed relative to the ITK image it came from.
- Do not create new `.md` files unless explicitly requested.
- Refresh the graphify knowledge graph after any public API change:
  `graphify update .`.

## Architecture Role

- Propose a numbered design plan with tradeoffs before structural changes.
- Identify every file that will change and how the class hierarchy is affected.
- Flag changes at the ITK/PyVista boundary, which stays in the internal LPS
  frame, or the LPS to USD Y-up export transform as high-risk.

## File Operations

- Use `git mv` and `git rm`, not `mv` or `rm`, to preserve history.
