## toolbox

> Manages component dependencies (skills, commands, rules, modes, agents) for a project. Parses component URLs from the project's boot file, fetches them into a local .toolbox/ cache, projects them into agent-specific project-local paths (for example .claude/ and .opencode/), tracks freshness, and updates on demand. Use this skill when a project's boot file declares components via URL.


# Toolbox — Component Management

Resolve, cache, project, and update component dependencies declared in a project's boot file.

## When This Skill Applies

When you land in a project and the boot file contains a `## Toolbox` section with a link to this skill (toolbox), follow the procedure below to ensure all declared components are available locally before doing any work.

## Core Model: Cache + Projection

Toolbox has two layers:

1. **Canonical cache (`.toolbox/`)** for fetches, hashes, and update detection.
2. **Agent projection roots** for compatibility with agent-specific discovery paths.

Projection roots are always inside the repository (for example `.claude/` and `.opencode/`).

Never install or sync Toolbox-managed components to global locations such as `~/.claude` or `~/.config/opencode`.

## Agent Projection Paths (Project-Local Only)

Use these known project-local roots when applicable:

- **OpenCode:** `.opencode/`
- **Claude Code:** `.claude/`

Default relative layout under each projection root:

```
skills/{name}/SKILL.md
commands/{name}.md
rules/{name}.md
modes/{name}.md
agents/{name}.md
```

Projection selection rules:

1. Always project for the active agent.
2. Also project to other known roots that already exist in the repo.
3. Never project outside the repo root.
4. Prefer symlink; fallback to copy if symlinks are unavailable.

## Component Types

Toolbox manages different types of agent components. Each type has its own subsection under `## Toolbox` in the boot file, its own cache subdirectory, and its own entry in the manifest.

### Skills

Skills are instruction sets that teach agents how to perform specific tasks. A skill is a directory with a `SKILL.md` entry point and optional reference files.

- **Boot file section:** `### Skills` (under `## Toolbox`)
- **Cache location:** `.toolbox/skills/{name}/SKILL.md`
- **Projection location:** `{projection_root}/skills/{name}/SKILL.md`
- **Reference discovery:** Yes — relative markdown links in `SKILL.md` are fetched automatically.

### Commands

Commands are single-file agent instructions invoked by name (e.g., `/test`, `/deploy`). A command is a single markdown file.

- **Boot file section:** `### Commands` (under `## Toolbox`)
- **Cache location:** `.toolbox/commands/{name}.md`
- **Projection location:** `{projection_root}/commands/{name}.md`
- **Reference discovery:** No — commands are single files.

### Rules

Rules are behavioral constraints that modify how the agent operates (e.g., "always write tests", "never push to main"). A rule is a single markdown file.

- **Boot file section:** `### Rules` (under `## Toolbox`)
- **Cache location:** `.toolbox/rules/{name}.md`
- **Projection location:** `{projection_root}/rules/{name}.md`
- **Reference discovery:** No — rules are single files.

### Modes

Modes are operating profiles that configure the agent's behavior for a specific workflow (e.g., code-review, architect, planner). A mode is a single markdown file.

- **Boot file section:** `### Modes` (under `## Toolbox`)
- **Cache location:** `.toolbox/modes/{name}.md`
- **Projection location:** `{projection_root}/modes/{name}.md`
- **Reference discovery:** No — modes are single files.

### Agents

Agents are full persona definitions with system prompts and tool configurations. An agent is a single markdown file.

- **Boot file section:** `### Agents` (under `## Toolbox`)
- **Cache location:** `.toolbox/agents/{name}.md`
- **Projection location:** `{projection_root}/agents/{name}.md`
- **Reference discovery:** No — agents are single files.

## How Components Are Declared

Components are declared in the project's boot file under a `## Toolbox` section. The boot file is whatever file the agent reads on startup — `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, or any platform-specific equivalent. Each component is a markdown link in a bullet list under its type subsection:

```markdown
## Toolbox

This project uses [toolbox](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slagyr/toolbox/main/SKILL.md)
to manage agent components. If `.toolbox/` doesn't exist, fetch the toolbox
SKILL.md from the URL above and follow its instructions. Once bootstrapped:

- **Skills:** Load from `.toolbox/skills/{name}/SKILL.md` when their descriptions match the task at hand.
- **Commands:** When the user invokes a command by name (e.g., "/test"), read and follow `.toolbox/commands/{name}.md`.
- **Rules:** Read and apply all rules from `.toolbox/rules/` at session start.
- **Modes:** When the user requests a mode by name, read and apply `.toolbox/modes/{name}.md`.
- **Agents:** When the user requests an agent by name, read and apply `.toolbox/agents/{name}.md`.
- **Agent Paths:** Project cached components into agent-local paths (for example `.claude/...` and `.opencode/...`) so each agent can discover them where it expects.

- [braids](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slagyr/braids/main/braids/SKILL.md)

### Commands

- [test](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slagyr/agent-lib/main/commands/test.md)
- [deploy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slagyr/agent-lib/main/commands/deploy.md)

### Rules

- [no-force-push](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slagyr/agent-lib/main/rules/no-force-push.md)

### Modes

- [architect](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slagyr/agent-lib/main/modes/architect.md)

### Agents

- [reviewer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slagyr/agent-lib/main/agents/reviewer.md)
```

- The **link text** is the component name.
- The **URL** points to the component's entry point.
- Both `https://` and `file://` URLs are supported.
- Component names must be unique within their type. If duplicates are found, warn the user and use the last declaration.

## Procedure

### 1. Check for Cached Components

Look for `.toolbox/toolbox.json` in the project root.

- **If it exists**: components have been fetched before. Read cached components, then ensure projections exist for the active/known local agent roots (see §6). Check for updates only when the user asks (see §4).
- **If it doesn't exist**: bootstrap (see §2).

### 2. Bootstrap (First Run)

When `.toolbox/toolbox.json` is missing:

1. Create the `.toolbox/` directory in the project root.
2. Parse the `## Toolbox` section of the boot file for component subsections (`### Skills`, `### Commands`, `### Rules`, `### Modes`, `### Agents`). Extract each `[name](url)` pair.
3. For each declared skill (including toolbox itself — use the already-fetched copy rather than re-fetching):
   a. Fetch `SKILL.md` from the skill's URL.
   b. Discover reference files by parsing relative markdown links in `SKILL.md` — patterns like `[text](references/foo.md)` or `[text](some/path.md)`. Only include links to relative paths (not absolute URLs or anchors).
   c. Compute the base URL by removing `SKILL.md` from the skill's URL. Fetch each discovered reference file relative to that base URL.
   d. Write all fetched files into `.toolbox/skills/{name}/`, preserving directory structure.
   e. Compute a SHA-256 hash covering all fetched files (concatenate file contents in sorted order by path, then hash).
4. For each single-file component (commands, rules, modes, agents):
   a. Fetch the file from the URL.
   b. Write it to `.toolbox/{type}/{name}.md`.
   c. Compute the SHA-256 hash of the fetched content.
5. Determine projection roots:
   a. Include the active agent's known project-local root (for example `.opencode/` or `.claude/`) when identifiable.
   b. Include other known roots only if they already exist in the repo.
   c. Reject any root outside the repo (absolute paths, `~`, parent traversal) and warn.
6. Project cached components from `.toolbox/` into each selected root:
   a. Create needed directories.
   b. Prefer symlink to cached files; if unavailable, copy files.
   c. If a target file already exists and is not Toolbox-managed, do not overwrite it; warn and skip.
7. Write `.toolbox/toolbox.json` with cache and projection metadata (see §3).
8. Ensure `.toolbox/` is listed in the project's `.gitignore`. If not, add it.

### 3. The Manifest — `.toolbox/toolbox.json`

The manifest tracks cached components, their source URLs, fetched files, content hashes, and projection metadata. Example (hashes and timestamps are illustrative):

```json

  "skills": {
    "tdd": {
      "url": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slagyr/agent-lib/main/skills/tdd/SKILL.md",

        "commands/test.md",
        "rules/no-force-push.md",
        "modes/architect.md",

      ]
    },

}
```

**Fields:**

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `skills` | Map of skill name → skill entry. |
| `commands` | Map of command name → command entry. |
| `rules` | Map of rule name → rule entry. |
| `modes` | Map of mode name → mode entry. |
| `agents` | Map of agent name → agent entry. |
| `projections` | Map of projection name (for example `opencode`, `claude-code`) → projection entry. |
| `{type}.{name}.url` | The URL from which the component was fetched. |
| `{type}.{name}.fetched_at` | ISO 8601 timestamp of when the component was last fetched. |
| `{type}.{name}.sha256` | SHA-256 hash covering all of the component's files at fetch time. Computed by concatenating file contents in sorted order by path, then hashing. Used to detect remote changes. |
| `{type}.{name}.files` | List of all files cached for this component, relative to its cache directory. |
| `projections.{name}.root` | Project-local projection root (must be inside repo), such as `.opencode` or `.claude`. |
| `projections.{name}.strategy` | `symlink` or `copy` for projected files. |
| `projections.{name}.managed_files` | Relative files under the projection root that Toolbox is allowed to overwrite/remove. |
| `projections.{name}.updated_at` | ISO 8601 timestamp of the last projection sync. |

### 4. Check for Updates

Toolbox detects updates by comparing content, not by time. Each component's `sha256` in the manifest is the hash of all its files at fetch time.

**On session start**, if cached components exist, proceed silently. Do not fetch anything automatically — the cached versions are ready to use. You may repair missing projections from cache without network fetch.

**When the user asks** (e.g., "check for updates", "are my skills up to date?"):

1. For each component in the manifest, fetch all files from the URL.
2. Compute the SHA-256 hash covering all fetched files (same method as bootstrap).
3. Compare to the stored `sha256` in the manifest.
4. Report results:
   ```
   Component updates available:
     Skills:
       - braids (changed)
       - tdd (up to date)
     Commands:
       - test (up to date)
     Rules:
       - no-force-push (changed)
   Update? [y/n]
   ```
5. If the user confirms, proceed with §5 (Update) for the changed components.

### 5. Update Components

When the user asks to update (e.g., "update skills", "refresh components"):

1. Re-parse the boot file for current component declarations. This catches added or removed components.
2. For each declared component:
   a. Re-fetch all files from the URL.
   b. For skills, re-discover and fetch reference files.
   c. Overwrite the cached files.
   d. Update `fetched_at` and `sha256` in the manifest.
3. Remove any cached components that are no longer declared in the boot file.
4. Recompute projection roots using the same safety rules as bootstrap.
5. Re-sync projections:
   a. Add/update managed projected files for currently declared components.
   b. Remove stale managed projected files that no longer map to declared components.
   c. Never remove or overwrite unmanaged files in projection roots.
6. Write the updated `.toolbox/toolbox.json`.

### 6. Use Components

- **Canonical source:** `.toolbox/` is the source of truth for fetches, hashing, and updates.
- **Agent discovery:** Use projected files from the active agent root (`.opencode/`, `.claude/`, etc.) so each agent can find components where it expects them.
- **Fallback:** If a projected file is missing but cache exists, restore the projection from `.toolbox/` and continue.
- **Skills:** Load from `{projection_root}/skills/{name}/SKILL.md` (or `.toolbox/skills/{name}/SKILL.md` if projection is temporarily unavailable). References remain under the same relative structure.
- **Commands:** When the user invokes a command by name (e.g., "/test"), read and follow `{projection_root}/commands/{name}.md`.
- **Rules:** Read and apply all rules from `{projection_root}/rules/` at session start. Rules are always active.
- **Modes:** When the user requests a mode by name, read and apply `{projection_root}/modes/{name}.md`.
- **Agents:** When the user requests an agent by name, read and apply `{projection_root}/agents/{name}.md`.

## URL Schemes

### `https://`

Fetch via HTTP GET. This is the primary use case for portable, published components.

For components hosted on GitHub, use `raw.githubusercontent.com` URLs:
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/{owner}/{repo}/{branch}/path/to/file.md
```

To pin a specific version, use a commit SHA instead of a branch name:
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/{owner}/{repo}/{sha}/path/to/file.md
```

**Private repos:** `raw.githubusercontent.com` does not serve files from private repositories without authentication. For private components, use `file://` URLs or a URL that includes an access token.

### `file://`

Copy from the local filesystem. Useful for:
- Components under active development
- Private components that won't be published
- Migration from filesystem-based references

Example:
```markdown
- [braids](file:///Users/micah/Projects/braids/braids/SKILL.md)
```

**Note:** `file://` URLs are not portable across machines. Use `https://` for components that need to work everywhere.

## Reference Discovery

When fetching a skill's `SKILL.md`, parse it for relative markdown links to discover supporting files.

**Match patterns:**
- `[text](references/foo.md)` — standard markdown link with relative path
- `[text](some/path.md)` — any relative path (no scheme, no leading `/`)

**Exclude:**
- Absolute URLs (`https://...`, `http://...`, `file://...`)
- Anchor links (`#section`)

**Resolve:** Given a skill URL like `https://example.com/skills/solid/SKILL.md`, the base URL is `https://example.com/skills/solid/`. A reference `references/tdd.md` resolves to `https://example.com/skills/solid/references/tdd.md`.

For `file://` URLs, the same logic applies using filesystem paths.

Reference discovery applies only to skills. All other component types are single files with no references.

## Error Handling

- **Fetch failure (single component):** If a component's URL returns an error (404, timeout, network unavailable), warn the user and skip that component. Do not block the entire bootstrap or update process.
- **Fetch failure (reference file):** If a reference file fails to fetch, warn the user and continue. The skill may still be usable without it.
- **No `## Toolbox` section:** If the boot file has no `## Toolbox` section, toolbox does not apply. Do nothing.
- **Invalid `file://` path:** If a `file://` path does not exist, treat it as a fetch failure — warn and skip.
- **Projection root outside repo:** Reject and warn. Never write to global/home paths.
- **Projection conflict:** If a destination file exists and is not Toolbox-managed, do not overwrite; warn and skip that file.
- **Projection failure:** If symlink creation fails, fallback to copy. If copy also fails, warn and continue with remaining files.
- **General rule:** Never silently swallow errors. Always inform the user what failed and why.

## Limitations

- **No component dependencies.** Toolbox treats each component as independent. If skill A requires skill B, the skill author should note this in their `SKILL.md` description so that projects declare both explicitly.
- **Known roots only by default.** Automatic projection currently targets known project-local roots (such as `.opencode` and `.claude`). Other agents may require explicit root mapping.
