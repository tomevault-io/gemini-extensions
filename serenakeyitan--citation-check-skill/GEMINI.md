## citation-check-skill

> Vision-enabled verification gate with web search. Use when users want to (1) verify slides/reports/PDFs/images against authoritative online sources, (2) validate that citations actually exist and say what's claimed, (3) check charts/graphs/tables for accuracy, (4) audit AI-generated content in doc-only mode (no external knowledge). Two modes - search mode validates against web, doc-only mode ensures everything traces to provided documents. Supports content in any language.


# Citation & Hallucination Checker v2

Verification tool with vision + web search. Validates every claim against authoritative sources or provided documents. Works with content in any language.

**Design principle:** Deterministic verification. Same input → Same output.

---

## Two Verification Modes

### Mode 1: Search Verification (Default)

- Searches web for authoritative sources
- Validates citations actually exist
- Checks if cited sources say what's claimed
- Finds original data for statistics

### Mode 2: Doc-Only Verification

- User provides source document(s)
- EVERYTHING must trace to those docs
- Flags anything that appears to come from external knowledge
- Trigger: "only use this document" / "verify against the PDF only" / "don't search the web"

---

## Two-Pass Architecture

**Critical:** Always use two separate passes. Never interleave extraction and verification.

### Pass 1: Extraction Only

1. Read entire document/slides/images
2. Extract ALL claims using the Claim Extraction Rules below
3. Output numbered list: `[claim_id] | [claim_text] | [claim_type] | [location]`
4. **NO verification in this pass**
5. Present extraction to user for confirmation before proceeding

### Pass 2: Verification Only

1. Take Pass 1 output as fixed input
2. Verify each claim_id in sequential order
3. **NO re-extraction allowed** — work only with Pass 1 claims
4. Apply Status Decision Tree to each claim
5. Generate final report

This prevents "discovering new claims" mid-verification and ensures consistency.

## Claim Extraction Rules (Exhaustive)

Extract ONLY these claim types. Apply rules strictly — no judgment calls.

### EXTRACT as claims:

| Type            | Pattern                                                    | Example                                          |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Statistic**   | Any number with unit/context (%, $, count, ratio, decimal) | "92.3% accuracy", "$4.7B market"                 |
| **Comparative** | X is [comparative] than Y                                  | "3x faster than baseline"                        |
| **Temporal**    | Time-bound assertion                                       | "In 2024, adoption reached..."                   |
| **Attribution** | Claim tied to source                                       | "According to WHO...", "Smith et al. found..."   |
| **Causal**      | X causes/leads to/results in Y                             | "This reduces latency by..."                     |
| **Existence**   | Asserts something exists/is true                           | "There are 500M users", "The model supports..."  |
| **Ranking**     | Position claims                                            | "largest", "first", "top 3"                      |
| **Quote**       | Direct quotation                                           | Any text in quotation marks attributed to source |

### DO NOT extract as claims:

| Type                              | Example                                            | Reason                          |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Definitions                       | "Machine learning is a subset of AI"               | Definitional, not factual claim |
| Opinions marked as such           | "We believe...", "In our view..."                  | Explicitly subjective           |
| Hypotheticals                     | "If adoption continues...", "Could potentially..." | Speculative                     |
| Questions                         | "What drives growth?"                              | Not an assertion                |
| Future predictions without source | "Will reach $10B by 2030"                          | Unless citing a forecast report |
| Methodology descriptions          | "We used PyTorch 2.0"                              | Process, not factual claim      |
| Acknowledgments                   | "Thanks to our collaborators"                      | Not verifiable                  |

### Extraction Output Format

```
[C01] | "Model achieves 96.555% accuracy on ImageNet" | Statistic | Slide 3, bullet 2
[C02] | "Outperforms GPT-4 by 12% on reasoning tasks" | Comparative | Slide 3, bullet 3
[C03] | "According to Chen et al. (2024), transformers scale linearly" | Attribution | Slide 5, para 1

## Numerical Precision Rules (Academic Standard)

**Default mode: Strict academic precision. Exact numbers only.**

| Rule                 | Source      | Claim       | Status            |
| -------------------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------------- |

| Any rounding = error | 96.555%     | 97%         | ✗ Numerical Error |
| Any rounding = error | 96.555%     | 96.6%       | ✗ Numerical Error |
| Truncation = error   | 96.555%     | 96.5%       | ✗ Numerical Error |
| Sig figs must match  | 0.834       | 0.83        | ✗ Numerical Error |
| Units must match     | 96.555%     | 0.96555     | ✗ Numerical Error |
| Direction matters    | +12% growth | +15% growth | ✗ Hallucination   |
| Order of magnitude   | $4.7B       | $47B        | ✗ Hallucination   |

### Numerical Error Output Format

```markdown
### Numerical Error: [Claim ID]

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Claim | "Model achieves 97% accuracy" |
| Location | Slide 4, bullet 2 |
| Source | Chen et al. (2024), Table 3, p.8 |
| Source value | 96.555% |
| Claimed value | 97% |
| Deviation | +0.445% (rounded up) |
| Status | Numerical Error |

## Confidence Classification

| Level              | Criteria                                                   | Use when                            |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **exact**          | ≥95% word overlap OR identical number with identical units | Direct quote, exact statistic       |
| **paraphrase**     | Same fact, different words, no interpretation added        | Restated finding                    |
| **interpretation** | Inference drawn from source data                           | Calculated from source, synthesized |

**Rule:** When uncertain between levels, use the MORE CONSERVATIVE option and flag for review.

---

## Source Authority Hierarchy

When multiple sources found, prefer in this order:

| Rank | Source Type                   | Examples                                          |
| ---- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Primary source                | Original study, official report, raw data         |
| 2    | Government/institutional      | WHO, CDC, World Bank, national statistics offices |
| 3    | Peer-reviewed publication     | Nature, Science, IEEE, ACM                        |
| 4    | Industry reports (named)      | Gartner, McKinsey, Statista (with methodology)    |
| 5    | Reputable news citing primary | NYT, Reuters citing original source               |
| 6    | Secondary compilations        | Wikipedia (check their sources)                   |

**Rule:** If only Rank 5-6 sources found, status = "Unverified" with note "Only secondary sources found"

---

## Multi-Source Verification (Search Mode)

A claim achieves "Verified" status only if:

| Condition              | Sources Required                                    |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Primary source found   | 1 (if authoritative: .gov, peer-reviewed, official) |
| Only secondary sources | ≥2 independent sources agreeing                     |
| Sources conflict       | Status = "Unverified", note the conflict            |

---

## Tie-Breaker Rules

When uncertain, apply these rules. No judgment calls.

| Situation                                 | Rule                                                         |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Missing date on claim                     | Assume refers to most recent year available; flag "needs date" |
| Conflicting sources                       | Use most recent authoritative source; cite both; note conflict |
| Source not found after all queries        | Status = "Unverified" (NOT "Hallucination")                  |
| Number differs due to currency conversion | Flag as "Needs clarification: currency/units"                |
| Same org, multiple reports                | Use most recent; cite with date                              |
| Claim uses "approximately" or "about"     | Still verify base number is in valid range (±10% of source)  |
| Source is paywalled                       | Note "Source behind paywall, unable to verify exact text"    |
| Source is in different language           | Translate and verify; note translation                       |

---

## Visual Data Verification

For every chart, graph, table, or diagram:

### Step 1: Extract Data Points

- Read ALL values from the visual
- Record: axis labels, units, scale, legend
- Note any visual distortions (truncated axes, 3D effects, etc.)

### Step 2: Find Source

- Search mode: Run search templates for the data
- Doc-only mode: Locate in source document

### Step 3: Compare Value-by-Value

```markdown
| Visual Element | Extracted Value | Source Value | Status |
|----------------|-----------------|--------------|--------|
| Bar 1 (2022) | 45% | 45.0% | ✓ Verified |
| Bar 2 (2023) | 62% | 58.3% | ✗ Numerical Error |
| Bar 3 (2024) | 78% | Not in source | ✗ Hallucination |
```

### Step 4: Check Visual Integrity

| Check                                   | Issue Type                             |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Y-axis starts at non-zero               | "Visual Distortion: axis manipulation" |
| 3D effects distort proportions          | "Visual Distortion: 3D exaggeration"   |
| Missing error bars when source has them | "Misleading: uncertainty omitted"      |
| Different time ranges than source       | "Misleading: cherry-picked timeframe"  |

---

## Doc-Only Mode Workflow

**Trigger phrases:**

- "only use this document"
- "don't search the web"
- "verify against the PDF only"
- "everything should be from the source"

### Step 1: Index Source Document

Build complete index before any verification:

```
SOURCE INDEX
Document: [filename]
Pages: [count]

Page 1:
- Text: [summary of content]
- Statistics: [list all numbers with context]
- Tables: [Table 1: columns X, Y, Z]
- Figures: [Figure 1: shows X]

Page 2:
...
```

### Step 2: Apply Two-Pass Architecture

Same as search mode, but verification uses ONLY the source index.

### Step 3: Trace Each Claim

```
Claim: [C01] "Model achieves 92% accuracy"
Search index for: "92", "accuracy", "performance"
├─ Found: Section 4.2, p.8 — "Our model achieves 92.1% accuracy"
│   └─ Status: Numerical Error (92% vs 92.1%)
│
OR
│
├─ Not found in index
│   └─ Status: "Not in Source"
│       Issue: "This claim cannot be traced to the provided document"
│       Likely: External knowledge / hallucination
```

### Step 4: Flag ALL External Knowledge

In doc-only mode, ANY claim not traceable to source = problem

```markdown
### External Knowledge Detected

These claims are NOT in the provided document:

| Claim ID | Claim | Status | Issue |
|----------|-------|--------|-------|
| C07 | "This method is widely adopted in industry" | Not in Source | Appears to be from model training data |
| C12 | "Published in Nature 2024" | Not in Source | Publication venue not mentioned in source |
```

---

## Output Format

### Summary Block (Always First)

```markdown
## Verification Report

**Mode:** [Search / Doc-Only]
**Document:** [filename or description]
**Generated:** [timestamp]

### Summary
| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Total claims extracted | X |
| Verified | Y |
| Numerical Error | Z |
| Unverified | A |
| Hallucination | B |
| Misleading | C |
| Not in Source (doc-only) | D |

**Overall Status:** [PASS: All verified / FAIL: Issues found]
```

### Detailed Findings (Grouped by Status)

```markdown

```

### Sources Consulted

```markdown
### Sources

| ID | Citation | Type | URL | Used For |
|----|----------|------|-----|----------|
| S1 | Chen et al. (2024) | arxiv | https://arxiv.org/... | C01, C02, C03 |
| S2 | Statista Market Report | report | https://statista.com/... | C08 |
```

## Critical Rules

1. **Two-pass always** — Extract first, verify second. Never interleave.
2. **Every claim gets checked** — No exceptions, no skipping "obvious" ones.
3. **Exact numbers only** — 96.555% ≠ 97% in academic mode.
4. **Find the origin** — Don't accept secondary sources citing unknown primaries.
5. **Run ALL search templates** — Don't stop after first result.
6. **Citations must be real** — Search to confirm papers/reports exist.
7. **Check what sources actually say** — A real paper can still be misquoted.
8. **In doc-only mode, flag ALL external knowledge** — Even if it's true.
9. **When uncertain, be conservative** — "Unverified" is safer than false "Verified".
10. **Follow tie-breaker rules** — No ad-hoc judgment calls.

---

## Language Support

- Accepts content in any language
- Searches in the appropriate language for sources
- Reports in the same language as user's request
- Cross-language verification supported (e.g., Chinese slides citing English papers)
- When translating for verification, note: "Translated from [language]"

---

## Output Format Options

**Quick:** Summary + critical issues only (Numerical Errors, Hallucinations, Unverified)
**Full:** Complete traceability report with all claims
**JSON:** Machine-readable audit (see references/citation_schema.json)

---
