> **Flight Finder** — The price trail airlines don't show you. Flight price evolution tracker with natural language search and shareable charts.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| Frontend | Next.js 15+ (App Router), TypeScript, CSS Modules |
| Database | PostgreSQL 16 + Prisma ORM |
| Cache | Redis 7 (rate limiting + response caching) |
| AI | Anthropic Claude, OpenAI GPT, Google Gemini, Claude Code CLI, Ollama, llama.cpp, vLLM |
| Browser | Playwright (headless Chromium for Google Flights scraping) |
| Charts | Plotly.js (interactive price evolution) |
| Hosting | Hetzner VPS (Docker Compose + Caddy) — flight-finder.org |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions (CI + Deploy on push to main) |

## Monorepo

npm workspaces: `@flight-finder/web` (`apps/web/`), `@flight-finder/cli` (`packages/cli/`).
Root `package.json` proxies common scripts to `@flight-finder/web`. `apps/desktop/` is a Tauri (Rust) launcher: deliberately NOT an npm workspace member and excluded from `npm run ci`; it is built only by `.github/workflows/desktop-release.yml`.

The CLI bundles the shared scraper (`apps/web/src/lib/scraper/*`) via relative imports but maps `@/*` to its own `packages/cli/src/`, so any new `@/lib/<x>` import added to a shared scraper file needs a matching shim in `packages/cli/src/lib/` (re-export the real module like `secret-crypto.ts`/`prisma.ts`, or a stub like `admin-recovery.ts`). Web-only checks pass without it; only the full `npm run ci` (web + cli) catches a missing shim.

**Versioning (locked):** `apps/web`, the root `package.json`, `packages/cli`, and `apps/desktop` all carry the SAME version number. `apps/web/package.json` is the source of truth; git tags `vX.Y.Z` track the web release and `desktop-vX.Y.Z` tags the desktop build at the same number (distinct prefixes, no collision). `/create-release` must bump all of them to the new version — `apps/web/package.json`, root `package.json`, `packages/cli/package.json`, and `apps/desktop` (its `package.json`, `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`, and `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`) — and regenerate both lockfiles (`package-lock.json` and `apps/desktop/src-tauri/Cargo.lock`).

## Environment Variables

All secrets via **Doppler** — NEVER use `.env` files. Project: `flight-finder`, config: `dev`.
Scripts wrap with `doppler run --`. Shared LLM keys from `pricetoken` Doppler project.

Critical: `DATABASE_URL`, `REDIS_URL`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `ADMIN_PASSWORD`, `ADMIN_SESSION_SECRET`, `CRON_SECRET`.

## Build Commands

```bash
npm install                    # All workspaces
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d db redis
npx prisma db push --schema=apps/web/prisma/schema.prisma
npx prisma generate --schema=apps/web/prisma/schema.prisma
npm run dev                    # Web app on :3003 (next dev --port 3003, no doppler wrapper at workspace level)
npm run ci                     # lint + typecheck + test + build (both web and cli workspaces)
```

| `navigate.ts` | Playwright navigates Google Flights, captures HTML |
| `extract-prices.ts` | LLM extracts structured price data from page |

## Prisma Schema

Models:
- `Query` (tracked flights, optional `userId` owner)
- `PriceSnapshot` (price data points; optional `vpnCountry` for VPN comparison runs)
- `FetchRun` (scrape run logs; optional `vpnCountry`)
- `ExtractionConfig` (LLM settings singleton; `multiUserMode` flag; `adminSessionsValidFrom` for session revocation on password change; RPM caps and preview concurrency fields; encrypted per-provider API keys `anthropicApiKey`/`openaiApiKey`/`googleApiKey`, set from the admin config or setup wizard)
- `ApiUsageLog` (cost tracking per provider/model)
- `User` (multi user accounts, self hosted only; `sessionsValidFrom` for per-user session revocation)
- `NotificationChannel` (per-channel notification config; nullable `userId` for admin-owned global channels)
- `PreviewRun` (create-time preview scrape job; `clientIp` for per-IP concurrency cap)
- `CommunityApiKey` (registered community node keys; tracks snapshot count and last-seen time)
- `CommunitySnapshot` (anonymized price snapshots ingested from community nodes)

## Design System: "Altitude"

Supports light/dark themes via `data-theme` attribute on `<html>`.

**Dark (default):** bg `#031820`, surface `#072530`, elevated `#0e3640`, border `#1a4a52`, accent `#80a8a5` (mid teal), text `#ecdfc0` (warm cream), secondary `#d4a574` (muted gold).
**Light (basic-light):** bg `#faf6ed` (cream), surface `#f1ead9`, elevated `#e8dfc8`, border `#d6cbae`, accent `#1a4a52` (deep teal), text `#031820`.
**Price up alert (shared):** `#c1272d` scarlet. Reserved for emphasis on rising prices, alerts, and editorial callouts.

Fonts: Bricolage Grotesque (display), Outfit (body), IBM Plex Mono (data).

Vintage travel poster aesthetic. Deep teal and cream with a scarlet alert accent. Pan Am and French Line ocean liner heritage. No amber primary, kept out to steer clear of the AI tool palette.

Other themes (cyberpunk, tron, autumn, solar-red) remain as user-selectable alternates in `theme.ts`.

## Scraping Constraints

- **Rate limit:** Google returns HTTP 429 after ~30 sustained requests from the same IP. The default 3h cron interval stays well under this.
- **RT pricing:** Google Flights shows the full round-trip price on each flight result. The extraction prompt accounts for this -- do not sum outbound + return prices.
- **Google internal API:** undocumented endpoints exist (`GetShoppingResults`, `GetCalendarGraph`, `GetExploreDestinations`) but lack booking URLs, currency control, fare classes, and seat counts. We use Playwright for data completeness. See README comparison.

## Engineering Patterns

- **Component**: `Name.tsx` + `Name.module.css`. Named export, `styles.root`.
- **API Route**: Validate → query → `NextResponse.json()` with `apiSuccess()`/`apiError()`.
- **Scraper**: Playwright navigate → capture HTML → LLM extract → store snapshots.
- **Provider keys**: resolve via `resolveApiKey(provider, config)` in `lib/scraper/ai-registry.ts`. A DB-stored key (encrypted, set in admin config or the setup wizard) beats `process.env[envKey]`; an undecryptable value falls through to env. Never read `process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY` (or the other provider envs) directly in scraper paths. Selecting an env-backed provider with no usable key is rejected with 400 in `api/admin/config`.
- **Admin auth**: HMAC session cookie, verified in `middleware.ts` for pages, in handler for cron.
- **Accounts (self hosted multi user mode)**: opt-in DB flag (`ExtractionConfig.multiUserMode`) gated by `SELF_HOSTED=true`. Admin enables via Settings or setup wizard; the toggle handler atomically creates the first admin User, flips the flag, and backfills existing unowned non-seed queries. User auth is per-route via `getCurrentUser()` (DB lookup so deleted users lose access immediately). Token shape: `admin:<ts>.<sig>` for legacy admin, `user:<userId>:<ts>.<sig>` for users; both share the `ft-session` cookie. Login rate limited via `lib/rate-limit.ts`.

## DO

- Use CSS Modules for all styling
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Use Server Components by default
- Return proper HTTP status codes
- Cache API responses in Redis (5min TTL)
- Use `doppler run --` for all scripts that need secrets

## Pre-Release Gate (MANDATORY before `/create-release`)

All four tests must pass before tagging a release:

```bash
./scripts/docker-smoke-test.sh    # Docker infra: build, health, chromium, extraction, DB
./scripts/install-flow-test.sh    # Static + grep regression checks on install.sh / flight-finder-cli
./scripts/cli-runtime-test.sh     # Behavioral CLI runtime matrix (docker v1/v2, podman compose, podman-compose)
./scripts/migration-test.sh       # Static checks on ~/.flight-finder to ~/.flight-finder migration + deprecated alias
```

If any fails, fix the issue and re-run. Do NOT tag without all four passing.

The release commit must bump every package to the same new version — `apps/web/package.json`, the root `package.json`, `packages/cli/package.json`, and `apps/desktop` (`package.json`, `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`, `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`) — and regenerate both lockfiles (`package-lock.json` and `apps/desktop/src-tauri/Cargo.lock`), so every version stays accurate for tooling that reads them.

The runtime-matrix harness (`cli-runtime-test.sh`) is what catches the
"works on docker, broken on podman" class of bug (issues #62, #72). It
shims `docker`/`podman`/`*compose`/`curl` and asserts the recorded
invocations — every CLI command across every compose flavor.

## DON'T

- Use Tailwind, inline styles, or styled-components
- Use `any` type
- Use `.env` files — always Doppler
- Commit API keys or secrets
