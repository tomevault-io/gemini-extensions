# shipyard - GitHub Copilot Instructions

Always follow these instructions first and fallback to search or bash commands only when you encounter unexpected information that does not match the info here.

## Working Effectively

### Bootstrap, Build, and Test the Repository
Run commands in this exact sequence from the repository root:

- `npm run setup` -- installs all dependencies and runs allowed lifecycle scripts. Takes ~25 seconds. NEVER CANCEL. This project uses `@lavamoat/allow-scripts` to disable npm lifecycle scripts by default for security.
- `npx biome ci .` -- runs linting checks. Takes <1 second.
- `npm run test --workspaces --if-present` -- runs all unit tests. Takes <2 seconds total.
- `npm run build --workspace=demo` -- builds demo app. Takes ~4 seconds. NEVER CANCEL. Set timeout to 120+ seconds.
- `npm run build --workspace=docs` -- builds docs app. Takes ~4 seconds. NEVER CANCEL. Set timeout to 120+ seconds.

### Run Unit Tests
Unit tests use Vitest and are located in individual packages:
- `cd packages/docs && npx vitest run` -- runs docs package tests (~1 second)
- `cd packages/base && npx vitest run` -- runs base package tests (~1 second)

### Run the Applications
Both demo and docs apps can run in development or preview mode:

**Development mode** (with hot reload):
- Demo: `cd apps/demo && npm run dev` -- starts at http://localhost:4321/, takes ~1 second to start
- Docs: `cd apps/docs && npm run dev` -- starts at http://localhost:4321/, takes ~1 second to start

**Preview mode** (production build):
- Demo: `cd apps/demo && npm run preview` -- requires build first, starts at http://localhost:4321/
- Docs: `cd apps/docs && npm run preview` -- requires build first, starts at http://localhost:4321/

### E2E Testing with Playwright
E2E tests are located in `apps/demo/tests/e2e/`:
- `cd apps/demo && npx playwright install --with-deps` -- installs browsers. Takes 5-15 minutes. NEVER CANCEL. Set timeout to 1200+ seconds. May fail in some environments due to download restrictions.
- `npm run test:e2e` -- runs E2E tests. Takes ~30 seconds if browsers are installed. NEVER CANCEL. Set timeout to 300+ seconds.
- `npm run test:e2e:ui` -- runs E2E tests with UI for debugging

Note: If Playwright browser installation fails, document it as "E2E tests require Playwright browsers which may fail to install in restricted environments."

## Validation
Always validate changes by running through complete end-to-end scenarios:

### Manual Validation Scenarios
After making any changes, ALWAYS test these scenarios:

1. **Build Validation**: Run both demo and docs builds successfully
2. **Navigation Testing**: 
   - Start demo app: `cd apps/demo && npm run dev`
   - Visit http://localhost:4321/ (redirects to locale-specific URL)
   - Test navigation between Blog, About pages
   - Verify internationalization works by visiting `/en/blog` and `/de/blog`
   - Confirm navigation links include locale prefixes correctly
3. **Content Validation**:
   - Verify blog posts load correctly
   - Check that titles display properly (format: "Site Title - Page Title")
   - Ensure styling with Tailwind CSS + DaisyUI works

### Pre-commit Validation
Always run these commands before committing changes or the CI (.github/workflows/checks.yml) will fail:
- `npx biome format --write .` -- formats code
- `npx biome ci .` -- validates formatting and linting

### Changeset Management
ALWAYS create changeset files for any package changes:
- `npx changeset add` -- creates a changeset for versioning and release notes
- Use appropriate semver levels: `patch` for bug fixes, `minor` for features, `major` for breaking changes
- Write user-focused descriptions (not implementation details)

## Repository Structure

### Monorepo Layout
```
shipyard/
├── packages/
│   ├── base/          # @levino/shipyard-base - Core components and layouts
│   ├── docs/          # @levino/shipyard-docs - Documentation features
│   └── blog/          # @levino/shipyard-blog - Blog functionality
├── apps/
│   ├── demo/          # Demo application showcasing all features
│   └── docs/          # Documentation site for the framework
├── .github/workflows/ # CI/CD with linting, unit tests, and E2E tests
└── .changeset/        # Version management and release notes
```

### Key Technology Stack
- **Framework**: Astro 5.x with TypeScript (strict mode)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with DaisyUI components
- **Package Manager**: npm with workspaces
- **Testing**: Vitest (unit tests), Playwright (E2E tests)
- **Linting/Formatting**: Biome (replaces ESLint + Prettier)
- **Internationalization**: Built-in i18n with EN/DE locales
- **Git Hooks**: Lefthook with pre-commit formatting

### Package Dependencies
Each package uses peer dependencies for core frameworks:
- `astro: ^5` (Astro framework)
- `tailwindcss: ^3` (CSS framework) 
- `daisyui: ^4` (Component library)
- `@tailwindcss/typography: ^0.5.10` (Typography plugin)

## Common Tasks

### Frequently Used Commands and Outputs

#### Repository Root Contents
```bash
ls -la
```
```
.changeset/     # Changeset configuration for versioning
.github/        # GitHub workflows and configurations
apps/           # Demo and docs applications
packages/       # Core shipyard packages
biome.json      # Biome linting/formatting config
package.json    # Root workspace configuration
tailwind.config.js  # Tailwind CSS configuration
tsconfig.json   # TypeScript configuration (extends Astro strictest)
```

#### Package Scripts Reference
Root package.json scripts:
- `test:e2e` -- runs E2E tests in demo app
- `test:e2e:ui` -- runs E2E tests with UI
- `prepare` -- installs git hooks with Husky

Demo app scripts (`apps/demo/package.json`):
- `dev` -- development server with hot reload
- `build` -- production build
- `preview` -- preview production build
- `test:e2e` -- Playwright E2E tests

### Navigation Patterns
The shipyard framework uses configuration-driven navigation:
```javascript
navigation: {
  docs: { label: 'Documentation', href: '/docs' },
  blog: { label: 'Blog', href: '/blog' },
  about: { label: 'About', href: '/about' }
}
```

### Content Organization
Content is organized by locale:
```
src/content/
├── docs/
│   ├── en/ # English documentation
│   └── de/ # German documentation  
└── blog/
    ├── en/ # English blog posts
    └── de/ # German blog posts
```

### Title Handling
Use the `getTitle(siteTitle, pageTitle)` utility from `packages/base/src/tools/title.ts` for consistent page titles.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Build fails**: Check that all peer dependencies are properly installed by running `npm run setup` in the root directory.

**Styling issues**: Verify Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI are properly configured. Check that `tailwind({ applyBaseStyles: false })` is set in Astro config to avoid conflicts.

**E2E tests fail**: Ensure Playwright browsers are installed with `npx playwright install --with-deps`. Tests may fail in restricted environments due to browser download limitations.

**Git hooks not working**: Run `npm run setup` to reinstall Lefthook git hooks.

**Missing changesets**: Always run `npx changeset add` after making changes to packages to ensure proper versioning.

### Performance Expectations
- Dependency installation: ~25 seconds
- Linting: <1 second  
- Unit tests: <1 second per package
- App builds: ~4 seconds each
- Development server startup: ~1 second
- E2E test suite: ~30 seconds (if browsers installed)

### Development Workflow
1. Make changes to packages or apps
2. Test changes: `cd apps/demo && npm run dev`
3. Run unit tests: `npm run test --workspaces --if-present`
4. Build applications: `npm run build --workspace=demo`
5. Format code: `npx biome format --write .`
6. Validate: `npx biome ci .`
7. Create changeset: `npx changeset add` (for package changes)
8. Commit changes

Always use the demo app as a testing ground for package changes and verify that internationalization features work correctly across both English and German locales.
