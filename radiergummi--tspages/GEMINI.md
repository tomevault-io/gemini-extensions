# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this
repository.

## Build & Test

```bash
go build ./cmd/tspages        # build the binary
go test ./...                  # run all tests
go test ./internal/serve/...   # run tests for one package
go test -run TestHandler_ServesFile ./internal/serve/...  # run a single test
```

No linter, Makefile, or CI configuration exists. The module is `tspages` using Go 1.25.

## Logging

**Always use `log/slog` for logging. Never use the `log` standard library package.** All log calls
must include a `"component"` attribute as the first key-value pair after the message string to
identify the subsystem. Use the package name as the component value (e.g. `"deploy"`, `"serve"`,
`"multihost"`). For `tsnet.Server.UserLogf` callbacks, use `"component", "tsnet"`.

## Changelog

**Every commit that has implications for users must include a corresponding update to `CHANGELOG.md`.** Add a bullet
under the `[Unreleased]` section in the appropriate subsection (`Added`, `Changed`, `Fixed`, `Removed`). Write
entries from the user's perspective — describe the observable effect, not the implementation detail.
The changelog follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) format. At release
time, `[Unreleased]` is renamed to the new version with a date, and the comparison links at the
bottom are updated.

## Architecture

tspages is a static site hosting platform for Tailscale networks. It runs multiple tsnet servers —
one **control plane** for deploy/admin APIs and one **per site** for serving content.

```
pages.tailnet.ts.net     → control plane (deploy + admin)
docs.tailnet.ts.net      → serves docs site
demo.tailnet.ts.net      → serves demo site
```

### Package dependency flow

```

### Deployment disk layout

```
data/sites/{site}/
  current              → symlink to active deployment
  deployments/{id}/
    .complete
    manifest.json
    config.toml        ← parsed from tspages.toml (if provided)
    content/
```

### Key design decisions

- **Site name = tsnet hostname = DNS label.** `ValidSiteName` in `storage/store.go` enforces
  lowercase alphanumeric + hyphens, max 63 chars. This is the single validation point — the deploy
  handler calls it before any other work.
- **`multihost.Manager`** owns the map of `siteName → *tsnet.Server`. `EnsureServer(site)` uses
  double-check locking: checks the map under lock, releases lock for blocking tsnet startup,
  re-acquires to store. `deploy.SiteManager` is the interface the deploy handler uses — keeps the
  dependency one-directional.
- **Serve handler is per-site.** `serve.NewHandler(store, site)` bakes in the site name at
  construction. Each site's mux is just `GET /{path...}`.
- **Auth is capability-based.** `auth.Middleware` calls `WhoIs` on each request, parses capabilities
  from the tailnet policy, and stores `[]Cap` in context. Handlers check
  `CanView`/`CanDeploy`/`IsAdmin` themselves. The `WhoIsClient` interface (`auth/caps.go`) decouples
  from the real tailscale client for testability.
- **Storage is symlink-based.** Deployments live at `data/sites/{site}/deployments/{id}/`.
  Activation atomically swaps a `current` symlink. The serve handler resolves symlinks via
  `filepath.EvalSymlinks` before the path containment check.
- **Per-deployment config is TOML-based.** Deployers include `tspages.toml` in their ZIP root. At
  deploy time, it's parsed, validated, stored as `config.toml` at the deployment level (alongside
  `manifest.json`), and removed from `content/`. The serve handler reads it per-request (via the
  `current` symlink). Server-level `[defaults]` in the main config merge under deployment values.
  `SPA` and `Analytics` use `*bool` so nil means "inherit default".
- **Tests inject capabilities directly** via `auth.ContextWithCaps` — no mock WhoIs needed. Deploy
  tests use a `mockEnsurer` to verify `EnsureServer` calls.

### UI component classes

CSS component classes are defined in `web/admin/src/main.css` (`@layer components`). Use these
instead of inline utility classes in templates.

| Class | Use for |
|---|---|
| `.btn` + `.btn-primary` | Primary actions: deploy, activate, create |
| `.btn` + `.btn-ghost` | Secondary actions without a border: analytics link, settings |
| `.btn` + `.btn-outline` | Tertiary/neutral actions: pagination, cancel |
| `.btn` + `.btn-danger` | Destructive actions: delete site, purge data |
| `.pill` | Filter chips (time ranges). Active state via `aria-current="step"` |
| `.btn-icon` | Icon-only buttons: copy, close, settings |
| `.btn-inline` | Text-styled buttons inline with prose: "browse", "view details" |
| `.input` | Text/URL/email fields. Add `font-mono` for code-like inputs |
| `.select` | Dropdown selects. Same height as `.input` |
| `.toggle` | Boolean switches. Uses `role="switch"` + `aria-checked` |
| `.segmented-control` | Mutually exclusive filter groups. Active state via `aria-current="true"` on child `<a>`/`<button>` |

All interactive elements include `outline-hidden`, `focus-visible:ring`, and `disabled` states.

### Feature inventory

**Serving features:** SPA mode, clean URLs (strip .html), custom index/404 pages, per-path headers,
redirects (named params + splats), trailing slash normalization, directory listings, gzip/brotli
compression (on-the-fly + precompressed), smart Cache-Control (immutable for hashed assets), ETags,
HTTP/103 Early Hints.

**Deploy features:** ZIP/tar.gz/tar/xz/markdown/HTML uploads, `tspages.toml` per-deployment config,
Netlify-compatible `_redirects` and `_headers` file parsing, deploy without activation
(`?activate=false`), atomic symlink activation, rollback via activating older deployments,
deployment cleanup (count-based retention), site deletion.

**Webhooks:** Fire on `deploy.success`, `deploy.failed`, `site.created`, `site.deleted`.
Configurable per-site via `webhook_url`, `webhook_events`, `webhook_secret` in site config. Delivery
attempts logged with status tracking. Admin UI for viewing deliveries.

**Admin dashboard:** Sites overview, site detail (last 5 deployments), per-site deployments page
(paginated), deployment detail with file diffs, global deployment feed (paginated), per-site and
cross-site analytics, webhook delivery viewer, health checks (`/healthz`, `/sites/{site}/healthz`),
help pages (embedded markdown), API docs (OpenAPI/Swagger), Atom feeds (`/feed.atom`,
`/sites/{site}/feed.atom`).

**Auth:** Capability-based via Tailscale ACLs. Roles: `admin`, `deploy` (site-scoped), `view`,
`metrics`. Site scoping supports exact names, `*` wildcard, and glob patterns.

**Observability:** SQLite analytics (request counts, top pages, visitor breakdown by
OS/device/tags), Prometheus metrics (request counts/latency, deployment counts/size, active sites
gauge), webhook delivery log.

**CLI:** `tspages deploy <path> <site>` with `--no-activate`, `--server` flag, env var, or
auto-discovery via Tailscale API.

When adding new pages to the admin dashboard, ensure there is an equivalent API endpoint for any user-facing data, and
that the API is documented in the OpenAPI spec.

When adding or updating features, update the documentation in `internal/help/docs/` and add appropriate test coverage.
For deploy features, ensure the CLI supports them as well.
