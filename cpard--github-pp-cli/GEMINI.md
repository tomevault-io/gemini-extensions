## github-pp-cli

> Every gh command, plus a local store, cross-org rollups, and FTS no other GitHub tool ships. Trigger phrases: `what's open across my org on github`, `cross-repo pr review load`, `github flake rank`, `release diff between tags`, `bottlenecks in github`, `use github-pp`, `run github-pp`.


# GitHub — Printing Press CLI

## Prerequisites: Install the CLI

This skill drives the `github-pp-cli` binary. **You must verify the CLI is installed before invoking any command from this skill.** If it is missing, install it first:

1. Install via the Printing Press installer:
   ```bash
   npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press install github --cli-only
   ```
2. Verify: `github-pp-cli --version`
3. Ensure `$GOPATH/bin` (or `$HOME/go/bin`) is on `$PATH`.

If the `npx` install fails (no Node, offline, etc.), fall back to a direct Go install (requires Go 1.26.3 or newer):

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/developer-tools/github/cmd/github-pp-cli@latest
```

If `--version` reports "command not found" after install, the install step did not put the binary on `$PATH`. Do not proceed with skill commands until verification succeeds.

github-pp-cli matches `gh` surface for surface and adds a sync engine + SQLite store so you can answer cross-repo questions in one query — `recent`, `bottlenecks`, `flake-rank`, `release-diff`, `reviewer-load`, `velocity`, `who-broke-main` — plus FTS that bypasses GitHub's 1000-result cap and a rate-limit-aware paginate that doesn't cliff-fail. Every command is agent-native by default: `--json`, `--select`, typed exit codes, `--dry-run` on every mutation.

## When to Use This CLI

Reach for github-pp-cli when the question is cross-repo or cross-org, when you need a structured + filtered answer (every command takes `--json --select`), when you want to grep beyond GitHub's 1000-result search cap, or when you want typed exit codes for orchestration. Use `gh` for one-shot interactive flows like `gh pr create` and `gh repo clone` — github-pp-cli wraps both surfaces but `gh`'s human ergonomics for those are world-class.

## Unique Capabilities

These capabilities aren't available in any other tool for this API.

### Cross-org rollups
- **`reviewer-load`** — See review load (given, received, pending) per teammate over a window — for 1:1 prep, perf cycles, and cross-squad rollups.

  _Reach for this when you need to know who's overloaded with reviews — `gh` cannot answer this without N round trips, and the 1000-result search cap breaks it on big orgs._

  ```bash
  github-pp-cli reviewer-load --org acme --since 30d --json --select user,reviews_given,reviews_pending,median_ttr_hours
  ```
- **`recent`** — One command, all repos: PRs merged, issues closed, releases cut, runs failed since a watermark.

  _Reach for this for daily / weekly cross-repo standup rollups instead of opening N tabs of `gh` invocations._

  ```bash
  github-pp-cli recent --since 24h --org acme --json --select kind,repo,number,title,actor
  ```
- **`velocity`** — Per-repo throughput: PRs/day merged, median PR lifetime, p50 time-to-first-review, median CI duration.

  _Reach for this for engineering health checks and rollups instead of pasting `gh pr list --json` into a spreadsheet._

  ```bash
  github-pp-cli velocity --org acme --window 30d --json --select repo,merged_per_day,median_lifetime_h,p50_ttfr_h
  ```

### Local store leverage
- **`fts`** — Full-text search across every cached issue, PR, commit, and release across every synced repo — bypasses GitHub's 1000-result cap.

  _Use this when GitHub's search would silently truncate at 1000 hits or when you need to grep comments + bodies + commit messages in one shot._

  ```bash
  github-pp-cli fts "flaky test" --type prs,issues --since 90d --json --select repo,number,title,updated_at
  ```
- **`bottlenecks`** — Surfaces PRs open >N days awaiting review, PRs red >24h, issues without a triage label after 48h.

  _Use this for Friday triage or sprint hygiene — one command instead of six tabs._

  ```bash
  github-pp-cli bottlenecks --org acme --review-stale 7d --check-stale 24h --json --select kind,repo,number,reason,age_hours
  ```

### CI / release forensics
- **`flake-rank`** — Per-job success rate over the last N runs of a workflow, ranked by flakiness with mean duration and last failure.

  _Use this to triage 'is this job flaking for the team or just on my PR' — `gh run list` cannot rank._

  ```bash
  github-pp-cli flake-rank --workflow ci.yml --repo acme/web --since 50runs --json --select job,success_rate,mean_duration_s,last_failure
  ```
- **`release-diff`** — Show PRs merged, issues closed, contributors, and files changed between two tags in one repo.

  _Reach for this to draft release notes or audit what shipped between two tags without walking `git log` and pasting SHAs into `gh pr view`._

  ```bash
  github-pp-cli release-diff v2.14.0 v2.15.0 --repo acme/web --json --select prs,authors,files_changed
  ```
- **`who-broke-main`** — For each red main-branch run, the merge commit, PR, author, and elapsed-red duration.

  _Use this for incident retros and deploy postmortems instead of scrolling `gh run list` and clicking through._

  ```bash
  github-pp-cli who-broke-main acme/web --since 7d --json --select run_id,pr,author,started_at,red_duration_s
  ```

### Agent-native plumbing
- **`pr ship-check`** — One-shot rollup of required reviewers, branch-protection rules, all check runs, merge queue position, and conflicts. Typed exit (0=mergeable, 2=blocked, 3=conflicted).

  _Agents reach for this to decide whether to merge; humans reach for it to debug 'why won't this PR merge'._

  ```bash
  github-pp-cli pr ship-check acme/web#1234 --json --select mergeable,blockers,required_reviewers,checks
  ```

### Finding the right command

When you know what you want to do but not which command does it, ask the CLI directly:

```bash
github-pp-cli which "<capability in your own words>"
```

`which` resolves a natural-language capability query to the best matching command from this CLI's curated feature index. Exit code `0` means at least one match; exit code `2` means no confident match — fall back to `--help` or use a narrower query.

## Recipes


### Friday triage: what's stuck

```bash
github-pp-cli bottlenecks --org acme --review-stale 7d --check-stale 24h --json --select kind,repo,number,reason,age_hours
```

One query for every PR or issue stuck across every synced repo, structured for piping into Slack.

### Draft release notes from tag-to-tag

```bash
github-pp-cli release-diff v2.14.0 v2.15.0 --repo acme/web --json --select prs.number,prs.title,prs.author
```

Joins synced commits × prs × users so release notes don't require pasting SHAs into `gh pr view`.

### Pick the right reviewer

```bash
github-pp-cli reviewer-load --org acme --since 30d --json --select user,reviews_pending,median_ttr_hours
```

Sorted reviewer load — assign the next PR to whoever is freshest, not whoever is loudest.

### Big payload? select fields

```bash
github-pp-cli pr view acme/web#1234 --json --select number,title,reviews.user.login,reviews.state,statusCheckRollup.contexts.name,statusCheckRollup.contexts.conclusion
```

PR responses are huge; `--select` with dotted paths cuts the payload to the four facts you actually need before piping to jq.

### Rank flaky CI jobs

```bash
github-pp-cli flake-rank --workflow ci.yml --repo acme/web --since 50runs --json --select job,success_rate,mean_duration_s
```

Per-job pass rate over the last 50 runs — surfaces the one job that's been red for two weeks before it eats a release.

## Auth Setup

No authentication required.

Run `github-pp-cli doctor` to verify setup.

## Agent Mode

Add `--agent` to any command. Expands to: `--json --compact --no-input --no-color --yes`.

- **Pipeable** — JSON on stdout, errors on stderr
- **Filterable** — `--select` keeps a subset of fields. Dotted paths descend into nested structures; arrays traverse element-wise. Critical for keeping context small on verbose APIs:

  ```bash
  github-pp-cli classrooms list --agent --select id,name,status
  ```
- **Previewable** — `--dry-run` shows the request without sending
- **Offline-friendly** — sync/search commands can use the local SQLite store when available
- **Non-interactive** — never prompts, every input is a flag
- **Explicit retries** — use `--idempotent` only when an already-existing create should count as success, and `--ignore-missing` only when a missing delete target should count as success

### Response envelope

Commands that read from the local store or the API wrap output in a provenance envelope:

```json
{
  "meta": {"source": "live" | "local", "synced_at": "...", "reason": "..."},
  "results": <data>
}
```

Parse `.results` for data and `.meta.source` to know whether it's live or local. A human-readable `N results (live)` summary is printed to stderr only when stdout is a terminal — piped/agent consumers get pure JSON on stdout.

## Agent Feedback

When you (or the agent) notice something off about this CLI, record it:

```
github-pp-cli feedback "the --since flag is inclusive but docs say exclusive"
github-pp-cli feedback --stdin < notes.txt
github-pp-cli feedback list --json --limit 10
```

Entries are stored locally at `~/.github-pp-cli/feedback.jsonl`. They are never POSTed unless `GITHUB_FEEDBACK_ENDPOINT` is set AND either `--send` is passed or `GITHUB_FEEDBACK_AUTO_SEND=true`. Default behavior is local-only.

Write what *surprised* you, not a bug report. Short, specific, one line: that is the part that compounds.

## Output Delivery

Every command accepts `--deliver <sink>`. The output goes to the named sink in addition to (or instead of) stdout, so agents can route command results without hand-piping. Three sinks are supported:

| Sink | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `stdout` | Default; write to stdout only |
| `file:<path>` | Atomically write output to `<path>` (tmp + rename) |
| `webhook:<url>` | POST the output body to the URL (`application/json` or `application/x-ndjson` when `--compact`) |

Unknown schemes are refused with a structured error naming the supported set. Webhook failures return non-zero and log the URL + HTTP status on stderr.

## Named Profiles

A profile is a saved set of flag values, reused across invocations. Use it when a scheduled agent calls the same command every run with the same configuration - HeyGen's "Beacon" pattern.

```
github-pp-cli profile save briefing --json
github-pp-cli --profile briefing classrooms list
github-pp-cli profile list --json
github-pp-cli profile show briefing
github-pp-cli profile delete briefing --yes
```

Explicit flags always win over profile values; profile values win over defaults. `agent-context` lists all available profiles under `available_profiles` so introspecting agents discover them at runtime.

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Success |
| 2 | Usage error (wrong arguments) |
| 3 | Resource not found |
| 5 | API error (upstream issue) |
| 7 | Rate limited (wait and retry) |
| 10 | Config error |

## Argument Parsing

Parse `$ARGUMENTS`:

1. **Empty, `help`, or `--help`** → show `github-pp-cli --help` output
2. **Starts with `install`** → ends with `mcp` → MCP installation; otherwise → see Prerequisites above
3. **Anything else** → Direct Use (execute as CLI command with `--agent`)

## MCP Server Installation

1. Install the MCP server:
   ```bash
   go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/developer-tools/github/cmd/github-pp-mcp@latest
   ```
2. Register with Claude Code:
   ```bash
   claude mcp add github-pp-mcp -- github-pp-mcp
   ```
3. Verify: `claude mcp list`

## Direct Use

1. Check if installed: `which github-pp-cli`
   If not found, offer to install (see Prerequisites at the top of this skill).
2. Match the user query to the best command from the Unique Capabilities and Command Reference above.
3. Execute with the `--agent` flag:
   ```bash
   github-pp-cli <command> [subcommand] [args] --agent
   ```
4. If ambiguous, drill into subcommand help: `github-pp-cli <command> --help`.
