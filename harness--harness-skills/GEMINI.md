# Harness Skills

This repository contains Claude Code skills for working with Harness.io CI/CD platform. All skills use the Harness MCP v2 server's consolidated tool interface.

## MCP v2 Server

All skills use the [Harness MCP v2](https://github.com/thisrohangupta/harness-mcp-v2) server which provides 10 generic tools operating across 119+ resource types:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `harness_list` | List resources with filters and pagination |
| `harness_get` | Get a single resource by ID |
| `harness_create` | Create a resource (requires confirmation) |
| `harness_update` | Update a resource (requires confirmation) |
| `harness_delete` | Delete a resource (requires confirmation) |
| `harness_execute` | Run, retry, interrupt, sync, toggle, approve, reject, test_connection |
| `harness_search` | Cross-resource keyword search |
| `harness_describe` | Local metadata/schema lookup (no API call) |
| `harness_diagnose` | Pipeline failure analysis |
| `harness_status` | Project health overview |

Tools accept a `resource_type` parameter (e.g., `pipeline`, `secret`, `template`) to target specific Harness resources. Tools also support Harness UI URL auto-extraction for `org_id`, `project_id`, `resource_type`, and `resource_id`.

## Cross-Skill Workflows

When users need end-to-end setup, follow these dependency chains. Each step depends on the previous -- do not skip steps or create resources that reference connectors/secrets that don't exist yet.

### New Microservice Setup

Use when a user wants to deploy a new service to Harness. Follow this exact order:

1. **Create connectors** (`/create-connector`) -- GitHub connector for source code and manifests, Docker/ECR/GCR connector for container images, K8s/cloud connector for target infrastructure
2. **Create secrets** (`/create-secret`) -- Authentication tokens, SSH keys, or credentials referenced by connectors
3. **Create service** (`/create-service`) -- Reference the Git connector for manifests, reference the Docker connector for artifact source
4. **Create environment** (`/create-environment`) -- PreProduction and/or Production with environment-specific variables
5. **Create infrastructure** (`/create-infrastructure`) -- Reference the K8s/cloud connector for the target cluster. If no connector exists for the target, create one first
6. **Create pipeline** (`/create-pipeline`) -- Build pipeline based on source code language and manifest type. Reference the service, environment, and infrastructure from previous steps
7. **Create trigger** (`/create-trigger`) -- Automate the pipeline with webhook (PR/push) or artifact triggers

### New Project Onboarding

Use when a user is setting up a brand new Harness project from scratch:

1. **Create project** -- Use `harness_create` with `resource_type: "project"` and the target `org_id`
2. **Create connectors** (`/create-connector`) -- All connectors needed for the project (Git, cloud, registry, cluster)
3. **Create secrets** (`/create-secret`) -- All secret references for connector auth
4. **Create service** (`/create-service`) -- Service definitions for each microservice
5. **Create environment** (`/create-environment`) -- Dev, staging, production environments
6. **Create infrastructure** (`/create-infrastructure`) -- Infrastructure definitions per environment
7. **Create pipeline** (`/create-pipeline`) -- CI/CD pipelines for each service
8. **Create trigger** (`/create-trigger`) -- Automate all pipelines

**Key rule:** Always check if a referenced resource (connector, secret, environment) exists before creating something that depends on it. If it doesn't exist, create it first. Ask the user for the org and project context before starting.

## Scope & Context Convention

Before making any MCP API call that creates or modifies resources, always establish the user's scope:

1. **Ask for org and project** if not already known. Most Harness resources are scoped to an org + project.
2. **Use `harness_list`** to verify referenced resources exist before creating dependents (e.g., confirm a connector exists before referencing it in a service).
3. **Account-level resources** (no org/project) are visible to all orgs and projects. Org-level resources are visible to all projects in that org. Project-level resources are only visible within that project.
4. **If the user provides a Harness UI URL**, extract `org_id`, `project_id`, and `resource_id` from it -- MCP tools support URL auto-extraction.

## Schema Validation Convention

When creating resources via `harness_create`, the Harness API validates the payload and returns specific error messages for malformed requests. Skills do NOT need to embed full API schemas. Instead:

1. **Each skill lists required fields** in its Instructions section (identifier, name, type, yaml, etc.)
2. **Use `harness_describe`** to discover the full schema for any resource type at runtime -- this is a local lookup with no API call:
   ```
   harness_describe(resource_type="service")
   ```
3. **On validation errors**, read the API error message to identify the missing or invalid field, then fix and retry

## Skill Standards

When creating or modifying skills, run `scripts/validate-skills.sh` to check compliance. See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for the full structure guide. Skills must have: frontmatter (name, description, metadata, license, compatibility), `## Instructions`, `## Examples`, `## Performance Notes`, and `## Troubleshooting` sections.
