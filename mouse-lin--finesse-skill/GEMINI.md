## finesse-ui

> finesse-ui design skill — never-cheap, high-craft web interfaces. Routes by register: brand (landing pages, hero sites, portfolios) → soul + spectacle engine; product (dashboards, admin, analytics) → component system + data viz. Enforces premium substrate, anti-slop blacklist, and pre-flight check on every output.


# finesse — Technically Spectacular · Soul-Distinct · Never Cheap

> **finesse builds two kinds of interface and routes by register:**
> - **brand** — design IS the product: landing pages, brand sites, launches, portfolios, hero pages. Optimize for **spectacle + soul + first impression**.
> - **product** — design SERVES the product: dashboards, admin panels, analytics, data tables, app shells. Optimize for **clarity + density + usability** — and still never cheap.
>
> The through-line is identical: **high craft, zero AI-slop.** The premium substrate, the cheapness blacklist, and the pre-flight apply to **both**.

## COMMANDS — targeted iteration (don't rebuild for one complaint)

A full build runs STEP 0–8. To iterate on an existing page, map the request to one verb and adjust only that — keep the substrate (STEP 3) and soul intact, then re-run the relevant pre-flight gates.

| Verb | Intent it matches | Focus |
|------|-------------------|-------|
| `init` | "new project / set up finesse" | write `PRODUCT.md` at project root — register, soul, locked dials, anti-references; every later page reads it |
| `document` | "capture the existing design system" | extract a `design-model.yaml` (palette/type/substrate/engine) from real code; report drift |
| `audit` | "is this any good? / review it" — **read-only**, never edits | run the blacklist + spectacle-shown + pre-flight, report findings |
| `bolder` | "too plain / boring" | SPECTACLE +2, engine up a tier (CSS → GSAP → Canvas → Three.js) |
| `quieter` | "too flashy / janky" | SPECTACLE −2, engine down a tier |
| `soul` | "feels generic / wrong vibe" | re-pick persona (STEP 2), re-lock the accent |
| `animate` | "make it move / different animation" | add/swap the engine only, motion alone |
| `densify` | "too sparse / too dense" | DENSITY ± — add/remove content |
| `redesign` | "improve / fix this page" | audit-first; change the responsible module, not the whole page |

---

## STEP 0 — BRAND READ (Before Any Code)

Most AI design output is bad because the model jumps to a default aesthetic. Don't.

**Read project memory first.** If `PRODUCT.md` (the locked brief) or `design-model.yaml` (locked palette/type/substrate) exist at the project root, read them — they override your guesses and keep this page consistent with the rest. Missing on a multi-page project? Run `init` (and `document` for existing code) first.

**Determine the register:**
- **brand** — landing page, brand site, launch, portfolio, campaign, hero page. Bold, opinionated, spectacular.
- **product** — dashboard, admin, analytics, data table, app shell, settings. Clarity, density, usability.

**Output a one-line Design Read before generating:**
`Design Read: {industry} · {soul in 2-3 words} · register={brand|product} · SPECTACLE={n} · hero-engine={type}`

**Anti-Default Discipline (two altitudes):** Name the lazy default, then beat it — and check the *second* reflex too.
- **First-order:** could someone guess theme+palette from the category alone? "Coffee → warm-beige + brass serif." Reject it.
- **Second-order:** could they guess it from category + your anti-reference? "AI tool that's *not* SaaS-cream → editorial-typographic." "Fintech *not* navy-gold → terminal dark mode." Avoiding the first default and landing on the obvious alternative is just slop one tier up. Rework until both are non-obvious.

---

## STEP 1 — THE THREE DIALS

Set these explicitly from the Design Read.

| Dial | 1–3 | 4–6 | 7–10 |
|------|-----|-----|------|
| **SOUL** | neutral, system-default | a clear vibe | unmistakable identity |
| **SPECTACLE** | static + CSS only | GSAP scroll, Canvas 2D accents | Three.js / GLSL / WebGL-FBO hero |
| **DENSITY** | airy, one idea/screen | balanced | editorial, data-rich |

- Astronomy / music / game / crypto → SPECTACLE 7–10
- Law / finance / healthcare / B2B → SPECTACLE 3–5
- Heritage / luxury / editorial → SOUL 8–10, SPECTACLE 4–6
- **Any product register** → SPECTACLE 1–4, DENSITY 6–9. Skip soul/engine sections.

**SPECTACLE ≥ 7 = must ship a working engine.** A gradient blob claiming SPECTACLE 8 is broken. Drop to 4 and ship a polished static page instead.

---

## STEP 2 — PICK A SOUL (brand register only)

Soul diversity is the job — the same method must yield visually unrelated pages for different briefs.

- **Cinematic tech** (cyan/magenta, Inter + JetBrains Mono, Three.js particles) — astronomy, AI, crypto
- **Phosphor terminal** (single neon-green, mono-forward, Canvas data viz) — quant, fintech, security
- **Editorial publication** (cream/ink, Playfair + Spectral, GSAP scroll-reveal) — magazines, film, journals
- **Warm heritage** (amber/copper, Fraunces/EB Garamond, Canvas fire) — whisky, coffee, craft
- **Brutal typographic** (bone/black + hot accent, Anton/Bebas, mix-blend-mode) — fashion, music, culture
- **Quiet luxury minimal** (off-white/forest, Raleway 100–900, CSS-only parallax) — architecture, hotels

Rules: **one soul per page**, never fluctuate. Saturated defaults (AI-purple-glow, beige+brass) are banned unless earned.

---

## STEP 3 — THE PREMIUM SUBSTRATE (both registers)

The physical layer that makes a page read as expensive. Apply to every output.

- **Grain** — SVG `feTurbulence` noise at `opacity .025–.05`. Kills the flat "vector slop" look.
- **Vignette** — radial-gradient darken on dark heroes for optical focus.
- **Type tension** — display headings at `clamp()` with negative tracking (`-.02 to -.045em`), `line-height .86–.95`, extreme weight contrast (900 vs 300).
- **Layered z-index** — engine(0) · grain(1) · vignette · content(5). Depth, not flatness.
- **Translucent borders** — `rgba(255,255,255,.07–.22)` dark / `rgba(0,0,0,.06–.08)` light. Never hard `#333`.
- **No pure `#fff` / `#000`.** Tint every neutral toward the brand hue.
- **Color lock** — one accent, whole page. Audit every component. No surprise colors.
- **OKLCH internally** — reason in OKLCH for palettes even if you emit hex.

---

## STEP 4 — HERO ENGINE (brand register only)

One technically-spectacular moment. Not five — one, at 100%.

| Engine | Use when |
|--------|----------|
| **Three.js + GLSL** | 3D depth, particle systems, bloom — SPECTACLE ≥ 7 |
| **Canvas 2D** | particles, fields, real-time data, waveforms |
| **WebGL FBO shader** | fluid, reaction-diffusion, ray-marching |
| **GSAP ScrollTrigger** | scroll-pinned story, horizontal pan, parallax |
| **CSS-only** | dual-layer mask, variable-font morph, `animation-timeline` |

Engine discipline:
- Page must be readable with the engine removed (progressive enhancement).
- 60fps or simplify — animate `transform`/`opacity` only.
- `prefers-reduced-motion` is mandatory — freeze to still frame.
- Motivated motion only. "It looked cool" is not a reason. Max one marquee per page.

---

## STEP 5 — PAGE SKELETON (brand register)

```
HERO (100vh) → MARQUEE (≤1) → STATEMENT/MANIFESTO → CORE CONTENT →
INDUSTRY SECTION → CTA/FINALE (oversized type) → FOOTER (mono, hairline)
```

- Nav: ≤80px, `mix-blend-mode: difference` over imagery, backdrop-blur on scroll.
- Layout diversification: each layout family (card grid, full-width quote, split) appears at most twice.
- Eyebrow restraint: max 1 eyebrow per 3 sections. Headlines usually suffice alone.
- Theme lock: one theme throughout. No warm-paper section in a dark page.

---

## STEP 6 — CHEAPNESS BLACKLIST (both registers)

Scan before shipping. *(If working inside the finesse repo, `node skills/finesse-ui/scripts/detect.mjs --json <target>` automates most of this and flags spectacle-claimed-not-shown; otherwise scan by hand.)* Headline offenders:

- **Em-dashes** in copy as a flourish — banned outright. #1 most-violated AI tell.
- **Gradient text**, default glassmorphism, side-stripe card borders, AI-purple glow.
- **Eyebrow on every section**, numbered `01 · 02 · 03` markers as default architecture.
- **Identical card grids** (icon + title + text × 6). Div-based fake screenshots.
- **Fake-precise numbers** (`92%`, `4.1×`) with no real source.
- **Default-category palette** — name it, reject it. Never reach for it blindly.
- **`Inter`/`Fraunces`/`Instrument Serif` as unexamined defaults** — fine if chosen deliberately.
- **Zero imagery** on image-implied briefs (food, hotel, fashion) — that's a bug.

---

## STEP 7 — PERFORMANCE & A11Y

- Animate `transform`/`opacity` only. `will-change` sparingly.
- `prefers-reduced-motion`: stop loops, freeze grain, static fallback.
- WCAG AA: body ≥ 4.5:1, large text ≥ 3:1.
- Visible focus states on every interactive element.
- Lazy-load heavy engines. `min-h-dvh` over `100vh`. CLS < 0.1.
- Touch targets ≥ 44px. Mobile layout declared per multi-column section.

---

## STEP 8 — PRE-FLIGHT (mandatory before "done")

Check all of:
- [ ] Design Read output with committed register + dials
- [ ] Premium substrate applied (grain, vignette, type tension, translucent borders, color lock)
- [ ] SPECTACLE claimed = SPECTACLE shipped (working engine if ≥7) — verify in a browser if available: open the page, confirm the hero renders real pixels, not a white/flat screen
- [ ] Cheapness blacklist cleared (em-dashes, gradient text, eyebrow spam, fake numbers)
- [ ] `prefers-reduced-motion` handled
- [ ] WCAG AA contrast verified
- [ ] Layout families diversified — no repeated pattern dominance
- [ ] Mobile layout declared

If any hard rule fails, fix before delivery. Shipping broken work is not an option.
