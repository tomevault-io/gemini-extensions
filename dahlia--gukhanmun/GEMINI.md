============

Before diving in, read [*DESIGN.md*](./DESIGN.en.md) to understand the overall
design, architecture, and roadmap.

This repository uses [mise] as the single entry point for development tools and
commands.

[mise]: https://mise.jdx.dev/


Setup
-----

Install the configured tools:

~~~~ sh
mise install
~~~~

List available project commands:

~~~~ sh
mise tasks
~~~~


Running checks
--------------

Run fast checks suitable for pre-commit hooks:

~~~~ sh
mise run check
~~~~

> [!TIP]
> To register that same task as this clone's Git pre-commit hook:
>
> ~~~~ sh
> mise generate git-pre-commit --task=check --write
> ~~~~

Run the full local verification gate:

~~~~ sh
mise run ci
~~~~

Useful individual commands:

~~~~ sh
mise run fmt
mise run fmt-check
mise run clippy
mise run ci
mise run doc
mise run test
mise run typecheck
~~~~


Conventions
-----------

Avoid relying on globally installed Rust tools or ad hoc command variants when
working on this repository. Add or update a mise task when the project needs a
new repeated development command.

Every new source file (Rust, TypeScript, JavaScript) must open with the GPLv3
notice block:

~~~~ rust
// Gukhanmun: <one-line description of what this file does>.
// Copyright (C) <year>  Hong Minhee

~~~~

Use `//` line comments for both Rust and TypeScript/JavaScript files.  Place
the block before any other content (imports, `#![...]` attributes, module
docs, etc.).

Document every new public Rust API with rustdoc comments. Public documentation
should explain the API's role, important invariants, and where it fits in the
pipeline so that `mise run doc` stays useful as an API review gate.


Writing docs
------------

After editing any Markdown file, format it with `hongdown -w`:

~~~~ sh
hongdown -w path/to/file.md
~~~~

Follow these prose conventions:

 -  Use sentence case for headings and subheadings, not title case.
 -  Avoid em dashes (—); use a comma, semicolon, or rewrite the sentence.
 -  No spaces around slashes (write “input/output”, not “input / output”).
 -  Use italics for file paths and file names (*CONTRIBUTING.md*,
    *src/main.rs*), and for document, section, and book titles (*DESIGN.md*,
    *Rendering modes*).
 -  Wrap dictionary names in italics for English prose
    (e.g., *Standard Korean Dictionary*, *Open Korean Dictionary*) and in
    double angle brackets (《…》) for Korean prose
    (e.g., 《標準國語大辭典》, 《우리말샘》).
 -  Wrap inline code in backticks (`mise run check`, `--flag`).
 -  Use the official spelling of proper nouns exactly.  If unsure, verify on
    the official website (e.g., Node.js, not NodeJS or Node).
 -  Write “hangul” and “hanja” in lowercase; they are common nouns, not proper
    nouns.  Ethnic and language names are proper nouns and take an initial
    capital: Korean, Sino-Korean, Chinese.
 -  When linking between pages of the Rspress documentation site under *docs/*,
    use a relative path ending in the *.md* or *.mdx* extension, optionally
    followed by an anchor (for example,
    `../cli/dictionary.md#building-a-custom-dictionary`).  The explicit
    extension keeps the anchor intact through `hongdown`.


Writing the changelog
---------------------

When adding a feature, changing existing behaviour, or fixing a bug, add an
entry to *CHANGES.md* under the current development version. Documentation-only
changes, including edits under *docs/*, prose in Markdown files, and code
comments, do not need an entry.

Organize entries by the public surface whose users will encounter the change.
Use a level-3 heading named after the Cargo crate or JavaScript package, such as
`### gukhanmun-core` or `### @gukhanmun/wasm`. Repeat a change under every
affected surface, including the crate where the behaviour originates and each
umbrella crate, CLI, binding, or shared type package that exposes it. This
duplication is intentional: a reader should be able to follow only the sections
for the components they use. Changes to internal generators belong under the
public crate whose behaviour or data they alter, not under the generator
itself.

Place an entry directly under the version heading only when it applies to the
workspace as a whole and cannot usefully be attributed to a particular crate or
package. Release-wide packaging and repository infrastructure changes are
typical examples.

Keep each bullet focused on one user-visible change. Split distinct behaviours
into separate bullets when that helps readers find the part relevant to them.
State what changed and how users access or configure it; include implementation
details only when they explain an observable constraint or compatibility
decision. End every bullet with bracketed issue or pull request references,
with reference links defined in the same version section.


Testing
-------

The test suite is laid out along the four axes documented in
[*DESIGN.md*](./DESIGN.en.md):

 -  **Regression fixtures** live under *tests/fixtures/* at the workspace root
    and are consumed by `cargo test -p gukhanmun --test fixtures`.  Each
    fixture is an `<stem>.input.<ext>` / `<stem>.expected.<ext>` pair with an
    optional `<stem>.toml` sidecar describing preset, dictionary records,
    homophone window, recovery policy, or assertion kind.  Sidecar fields are
    parsed by *crates/gukhanmun/tests/common/mod.rs*.

 -  **Property-based tests** live in *crates/gukhanmun-core/tests/properties.rs*
    and share generators with *crates/gukhanmun-core/tests/common/mod.rs*
    (`arb_hangul_only_string`, `arb_mixed_script_chunks`).  Existing
    case-driven assertions in *core\_mvp.rs* are not replaced; new properties
    should pull from `common::*` so the generator surface stays consistent.

 -  **Snapshot tests** use `insta` and live in
    *crates/gukhanmun-core/tests/snapshots.rs*.  The recorded shape is the
    test-layer projection `common::tokens_to_snapshot_value`, not a derived
    `Serialize` on the public types—internal renames inside `gukhanmun-core`
    do not churn *.snap* files automatically.

 -  **CommonMark conformance** lives under *tests/fixtures/commonmark/* and
    runs through the same fixture harness.  Each case is a hanja-free
    Markdown input plus the expected pulldown-cmark-to-cmark output, pinning
    that Gukhanmun does not perturb syntax it has no opinion about.

### Authoring a new fixture

1.  Add `<stem>.input.<ext>` (and `<stem>.toml` if the fixture needs a
    non-default preset, dictionary, or recovery policy) under
    `tests/fixtures/<category>/`.
2.  Run
    `GUKHANMUN_BLESS_FIXTURES=1 cargo test -p gukhanmun --test fixtures <filter>`
    once to capture the current converter output as `<stem>.expected.<ext>`.
3.  Run the same command without `GUKHANMUN_BLESS_FIXTURES=1` to confirm the
    new baseline holds, then commit the new files.

The harness normalises each fixture stem into a `libtest`-friendly test
name by replacing hyphens with underscores.  A fixture saved as
*html/initial-sound-raw.input.html* is therefore reported (and filtered)
as `html::initial_sound_raw`.

Bless mode tolerates a missing expected file (so the very first run works)
but only blesses `assertion.kind = "exact"`; `contains` fixtures must list
their needles in the sidecar.

### Updating an `insta` snapshot

`cargo-insta` is installed automatically by `mise install` as a managed
tool.  After editing engine behaviour, run the interactive reviewer:

~~~~ sh
mise run insta-review
~~~~

Accept the new baseline only after confirming the diff reflects the
intended change.  Snapshot review is intentionally not part of `mise run test`
because it requires a TTY.


AI usage
--------

If you use AI tools (such as Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, etc.) while
contributing, you must disclose this in your pull request description and
commit messages.  See [*AI\_POLICY.md*](./AI_POLICY.md) for the complete policy.

In commit messages, disclose AI assistance with an `Assisted-by` trailer of the
form `AGENT_NAME:MODEL_VERSION`, one line per tool.  Do not use `Co-authored-by`
for AI assistants; that trailer is reserved for human co-authors.

Release process
---------------

The single source of truth for the version is `workspace.package.version` in
*Cargo.toml*.  This repository keeps it set to the *next* planned release, not
the last released one.  Branch builds therefore publish development versions
such as `1.2.4-dev.456+<sha>` while `1.2.4` is in development, and the release
itself is just a signed tag whose name equals that version.  After releasing
`1.2.4`, immediately bump the workspace to `1.2.5` before landing new work.

CI derives every published version from `workspace.package.version` at publish
time: the `x.y.z-dev.N+<sha>` development publishes on `main` and the `x.y.z`
release publishes on a tag, restamping the Rust and JavaScript manifests alike.
You never hand-edit those versions for a release; the bump command below is the
only place a contributor sets a version.

### Version bumps

Version bumps go through `mise run bump-execute`, which wraps `cargo-release`.
`cargo-release` updates the shared workspace version, the intra-workspace
dependency requirements, and *Cargo.lock*, then writes a signed commit.  It does
not understand the npm and JSR manifests, so the task additionally syncs every
*package.json* and *deno.json* under *packages/* to the version `cargo-release`
applied and folds exactly those manifests into that one signed commit.  The task
never tags, pushes, or publishes.

Run the bump on a clean working tree: `cargo-release` refuses to proceed when
there are uncommitted changes, and the bump amends its own commit.

Before bumping, make sure your local Git signing setup can sign both commits
and tags:

~~~~ sh
git config user.signingkey
git config commit.gpgsign
git config tag.gpgSign
~~~~

Preview the bump first; this runs `cargo-release` in dry-run mode and changes
nothing:

~~~~ sh
mise run bump -- 1.2.5
~~~~

Inspect the planned workspace and intra-workspace dependency updates.  When the
preview is correct, create the signed bump commit, which covers the Rust crates
and every published JavaScript package under *packages/* together:

~~~~ sh
mise run bump-execute -- 1.2.5
~~~~

Push the bump commit normally:

~~~~ sh
git push
~~~~

### Tagging a release

Prepare *CHANGES.md* so it contains a `Version x.y.z` section for the release.
The GitHub Release body is cut from that section.

A release does not bump anything; it tags the version that
`workspace.package.version` already holds.  Create and push a signed tag with
that exact version:

~~~~ sh
git tag -s 1.2.4 -m "Release 1.2.4"
git push origin 1.2.4
~~~~

The *main.yaml* workflow verifies that the tag is signed and matches
`workspace.package.version`, runs the full CI gate, verifies locked crate
packages, publishes all crates to crates.io and all packages to npm and JSR,
builds release binaries, and creates the GitHub release.

If a new workspace crate or JavaScript package is added, seed its name on the
relevant registry (crates.io, npm, or JSR) once before relying on trusted
publishing for it.  Trusted publishing is used for normal release and
development publishes after the package already exists.

After the release succeeds, start the next development cycle immediately by
bumping to the next version:

~~~~ sh
mise run bump-execute -- 1.2.5
git push
~~~~
