# cubefarm

A cartoon first-person 3D office (React Three Fiber) over a Node orchestrator that runs one Claude Code session
(Claude Agent SDK) per developer, QA tester and the CEO, each in its own git worktree, working through GitHub issues.
This is the app the company runs on: a live office is running from this repo right now. README.md is the quick start; docs/how-it-works.md and CONTRIBUTING.md have the details.
It ships on npm as `cubefarm` (`npx cubefarm`); it used to be called Office Swarm.

## SAFETY (read first)

- The live office runs from `C:\Projects\office-swarm` on this machine, on ports 4317 (server) and 5317 (Vite),
  with its state in `~/.cubefarm`. Never edit or run anything there, never read or write `~/.cubefarm` directly, and
  never use ports 4317 or 5317.
- Test only in demo mode (fake GitHub, fake agents, no Claude usage), with an isolated `SWARM_HOME` and your reserved
  `SWARM_PORT` (from your job instructions):

  ```bash
  npm install
  npm run build
  SWARM_HOME="$PWD/.swarm-home" SWARM_PORT=<your port> node --import tsx server/index.ts --demo
  ```
  ```powershell
  npm install; npm run build
  $env:SWARM_HOME="$PWD\.swarm-home"; $env:SWARM_PORT="<your port>"; node --import tsx server/index.ts --demo
  ```
  Then open `http://localhost:<your port>` (the server serves the built `dist/`). The startup banner must say
  `DEMO MODE` and print a `state:` path inside your `SWARM_HOME`. Stop it when done; don't commit `.swarm-home`.
- Never real mode (no `--demo`), and never `npm run dev` / `npm run demo` / `npm start` / `npx cubefarm`: they default
  to 4317, and `dev`/`demo` default Vite to 5317. The first three run `scripts/office.mjs`, the launcher, which also
  updates its own folder (git fetch + merge, npm install, build) when the office or you ask for it (`u`). Run it
  only in a throwaway clone outside the live office, with `--demo` and your `SWARM_HOME`, `SWARM_PORT` and
  `SWARM_CLIENT_PORT`.
- Agents are ordinary coding-agent CLI sessions on the manager's own setup, unsandboxed, by the manager's choice. The
  office's workflow rules (no pushes to the default branch, no merging, QA leaves GitHub alone) live in their prompts
  and instructions, not in enforcement: don't add hooks, permission rules or sandboxes that refuse tool calls.
  `ANTHROPIC_*` / `CLAUDE_*` are stripped from agent and preview env.

## Scripts

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run typecheck` | `tsc --noEmit` over client, server, shared, the `.ts` in scripts and the configs |
| `npm test` | Vitest, once (`npm run test:watch` to re-run on edits) |
| `npm run build` | typecheck, `vite build` to `dist/`, then the server bundled into `dist-server/` (`scripts/build-server.mjs`) |
| `npm run test:e2e` | Playwright (`e2e/`, `playwright.config.ts`): builds, boots a demo office on `E2E_PORT` (default 4399; set it to your reserved port) with a temp `SWARM_HOME`, and smoke-tests it in headless Chromium |
| `node scripts/smoke-package.mjs` | after a build: packs the npm package, installs it into a temp folder and boots its demo |
| `node --import tsx server/index.ts --demo` | a demo office (see SAFETY for the env it needs) |

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): Node 24 on `ubuntu-latest` and `windows-latest`, `npm ci` → `typecheck` → `test` →
`build` → package smoke test, for every PR and push to `main`, with a throwaway `SWARM_HOME` and `SWARM_PORT=0`; a separate `e2e`
job on `ubuntu-latest` runs `npm run test:e2e`. All three must pass locally
before you open a PR.

## Code map

Server (`server/`, Node + Express 5 + ws, run by tsx in development; esbuild bundles it into `dist-server/` for npm):
- `index.ts`: entry; picks the real or demo backend, REST routes under `/api`, the `/ws` and `/ws/term` websockets, serves `dist/`, shutdown.
- `config.ts`: `SWARM_PORT` (default 4317), `SWARM_HOME` (default `~/.cubefarm`), `--demo`, state file, intervals,
  the default projects folder.
- `swarm.ts`: the orchestrator. Floors, agents, scheduling/auto-assign, dev → QA → fix → merge loop, dev and QA
  prompts, CEO job queue, phone messages, persistence (`state.json` / `demo-state.json`), websocket fan-out.
- `agentRunner.ts`: one Agent SDK session; options, env stripping, Playwright MCP, and turning the SDK stream into
  terminal lines.
- `cliRunner.ts`: the terminal runtime (the default): one agent as the real CLI in a node-pty, same session contract
  as `agentRunner.ts`. Claude Code reports through HTTP hooks (`POST /api/hooks/:token`; PreToolUse approves every
  call); Codex reports turn endings (notify) and, once the manager trusts them, its steps (`-c hooks.*`); OpenCode
  only turn endings. Codex/OpenCode screenshots are collected from the session's Playwright output folder. Esc in a
  terminal ends the session as `interrupted`. The CEO's office tools are served over MCP (`/api/mcp/:token`).
- `ptyHost.ts`: the terminal keeper, a detached process of its own (`launch` re-spawns it outside the office's process
  tree) holding the CLIs' pseudo-terminals and relaying their hooks, so agents keep working through office restarts.
  `ptyClient.ts` is the office's side (start/connect, spawn, adopt after a restart, local fallback); `ptyProtocol.ts`
  their JSON-lines messages. The launcher's `office:shutdown` says `restart: false` when quitting: CLIs stop then.
  A developer's CLI stays at its prompt after the task (`keepAlive`): follow-ups and prompts typed there reuse it.
- `clis.ts`: the CLIs (Claude Code from the SDK's bundled binary, Codex, OpenCode): detection, Windows `.cmd` shim
  unwrapping, each one's command line, and the helper scripts they call back with.
- `terminal.ts`: `AgentTerminal`, a headless xterm mirror per agent (replay for late viewers, saved to disk), its
  `/ws/term` viewers, and keystrokes/resizes to the running CLI.
- `ceo.ts`: the CEO's office MCP tools (`createOfficeTools`, zod-validated), `ceoSystemPrompt`, `ceoJobPrompt`.
- `backend.ts`: the `Backend` interface (everything touching GitHub, git, disk and sessions) and `realBackend`.
- `demo.ts`: `createDemoBackend()`: fake GitHub, fake sessions (drawn into the agent's terminal in the terminal runtime), fake previews for `--demo`.
- `github.ts`: all GitHub access through the `gh` CLI.
- `workspace.ts`: floor checkouts, per-agent worktrees (`<SWARM_HOME>/workspaces/<owner>__<repo>/desks/<agent>`),
  fast-forwarding main, per-repo git lock, stopping processes an agent left running.
- `exec.ts`: `run` / `git` / `gh`: `execFile` without a shell, prompts disabled, `CommandError` with stderr.
- `previews.ts`: one preview per floor: ports (6300 + floor), statuses, config validation.
- `previewRunner.ts`: checks out, installs and runs a floor's app in its preview worktree; kills the process tree.
- `httpError.ts`: `HttpError(status, message)`.
- `officeUpdate.ts`: the office's self-update: the drain decision, the launcher contract (IPC, `last-update.json`).
- `pacing.ts`: pacing new work after Claude's usage warnings: the start/skip decision and the usage state.

The `cubefarm` command (`bin/cubefarm.js`, plain JS): checks Node/git/gh/Claude login, starts `dist-server/index.js`,
opens the browser; `login` and `doctor` subcommands.

The launcher (`scripts/office.mjs`, plain JS; `npm run dev` / `demo` / `start`): runs the server (plus Vite with
`--dev`, watching `server/` and `shared/`) with `SWARM_LAUNCHER=1` and an IPC channel, and applies office updates:
stop, fast-forward, install/build, restart, roll back on failure, `<SWARM_HOME>/last-update.json`. Its pure decisions
are in `scripts/officeSteps.mjs` (tested in `officeSteps.test.ts`).

Shared (`shared/`, imported by both sides):
- `types.ts`: the REST/websocket contract (`WorldSnapshot`, `ServerEvent`, views, settings).
- `issues.ts`: issue conventions (`swarm:<specialty>` labels, `Depends on #N`, hold-up ranking).

Client (`client/`, Vite root; React 19, R3F, drei, zustand):
- `src/world/`: the 3D building: floors, desks, characters (`appearance.ts`, `characterParts.ts`), elevator,
  whiteboard, player movement and collisions (`layout.ts`), canvas textures (`draw.ts`), `toys/` (Rapier physics).
- `src/ui/`: HTML overlays: HUD, terminal (`LiveTerminal.tsx`: xterm.js on `/ws/term`), Kanban, manager's console,
  phone (with its mini-games in `games/`: pure logic in `tetris.ts` / `snake.ts` / `pet.ts`), elevator panel, app
  viewer, sounds (`sfx.ts`).
- `src/store.ts`: the zustand store; `apply(ServerEvent)` folds websocket events into UI state.
- `src/api.ts`: REST calls; errors become toasts.
- `src/net.ts`: the websocket connection with reconnect. `src/perf.tsx`: render pausing, adaptive DPR, `?stats`.

## Conventions

- ESM TypeScript everywhere (`"type": "module"`), strict, `noUnusedLocals`/`Parameters`. The server runs through
  tsx and imports with `.ts` extensions (`import { run } from './exec.ts'`); client files import without extensions.
- Comments are sparse and say why: a short header comment per file describing its role, `/** */` on exported
  functions and interface fields when the name isn't enough, inline notes for Windows or safety reasons, and
  `// ---------- section ----------` dividers in long files. No commented-out code.
- Demo parity: every new `Backend` method, CEO tool or capability gets a fake in `server/demo.ts`, so `--demo` works
  with no GitHub, no git/npm and no Claude usage.
- UI state comes from the server: on connect the client gets a `snapshot`, then typed `ServerEvent`s (`repo`,
  `agent`, `log`, `qa`, `ceo`, `message`, `toast`, …) from `Swarm.broadcast`. Add new state to `shared/types.ts`, the
  snapshot and an event, and handle it in `store.ts`'s `apply`. REST is for commands, not for polling state.
- REST errors: throw `HttpError(4xx, message)`; the handler in `index.ts` returns `{ error }` JSON, anything else
  is a logged 500. Validate request bodies by hand at the route or in the swarm.
- CEO tools: zod input schemas, errors worded so the CEO can act on them, small outputs.
- Windows first (the office runs on Windows):
  - build paths with `path.join` / `path.resolve`; paths may contain spaces, so pass args as arrays (`execFile`),
    never string-built shell commands;
  - `fs.rm` with `maxRetries` for EBUSY/EPERM file locks; write state to a temp file and `rename`;
  - kill process trees, not just the child (`taskkill /T /F` on Windows, process groups elsewhere);
  - `windowsHide: true` on spawns; npm on Windows goes through `cmd.exe`.
- Agent prompts are paid for on every session: keep prompt text short and specific.

## Tests

- Vitest, `*.test.ts` next to the code, anywhere under `client/`, `server/`, `shared/` or `scripts/`
  (e.g. `shared/issues.test.ts`, `client/src/world/layout.test.ts`, `server/ceo.test.ts`). Config: `vitest.config.ts`.
- Test pure functions directly; extract logic into pure helpers rather than mocking. No network, no `gh`, no Claude
  sessions, no real `~/.cubefarm`: `npm test` already points `SWARM_HOME` at a temp folder and `SWARM_PORT` at 0.
- Must pass on both CI runners (ubuntu + windows): don't hardcode `/` or `\` in expected paths.

## Pull requests

- One issue per PR, `Closes #<n>` in the body. Keep the diff small and on-topic.
- Many PRs merge in parallel and auto-merge sends conflicts back: don't reformat, reorder or rename code you aren't
  changing, and don't touch unrelated files.
- Say how you verified it and list your assumptions. UI changes get screenshots from the demo office.
- Never push to `main`, never force-push, never merge your own PR.
