# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Status

EKOS has an implemented Rust (2024 edition) Cargo workspace — this is not a design-phase repo.
Read `devlogs/devlog_*.md` (numbered chronologically — the highest-numbered file is the latest,
`devlog_148.md` as of this writing) before starting non-trivial work: they are the project's
long-term memory and record what shipped, why, and what was learned. `TODO.md` tracks the
phase-by-phase roadmap; RFCs are split across two locations for historical reasons, not a
meaningful distinction — `docs/rfcs/` (repo root) has `0001`–`0024`,
`ekos/docs/rfcs/` has `0025`+. **Check both directories for the highest existing number before
picking one for a new RFC** — two RFCs have already collided on the same number once (0027) from
sessions that only checked one location.

**The Cargo workspace root is `ekos/`, not the repo root** — there is no top-level `Cargo.toml`.
`benchmark/` and `tests/integration/` are separate Cargo workspaces that depend on the `ekos/`
crates by path.

## Commands

```bash
# Main workspace (run from ekos/, or pass -p <crate>/--manifest-path from elsewhere)
cd ekos
cargo build --workspace
cargo test --workspace
cargo test -p ekos-ledger                    # one crate, e.g. ekos-ledger, ekos-plugin-git
cargo test -p ekos-ledger some_test_name     # one test
cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings      # CI fails on any warning
cargo fmt --check                            # CI checks formatting, doesn't fix it

# Integration tests (separate workspace, depends on ekos/ crates by path)
cd tests/integration && cargo test

# Benchmarks (separate workspace, Criterion)
cd benchmark && cargo bench
cargo bench --bench ledger_write             # one benchmark file

# CLI (binary crate name is `ekos`, package is crates/cli)
cargo run -p ekos -- init
cargo run -p ekos -- build && cargo run -p ekos -- recover && cargo run -p ekos -- resolve \
  && cargo run -p ekos -- compile && cargo run -p ekos -- commit   # full pipeline, in order
cargo run -p ekos -- doctor

                                             # SequenceDiagrams + per-entity pages (RFC 0035/0037/0042)
cargo run -p ekos -- simulate <scenario.yaml>       # World Engine: load + run a scenario (RFC 0047-0055)
cargo run -p ekos -- replay <scenario.yaml>         # read back a previously recorded simulation, read-only
```

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs build+test+clippy+fmt from `ekos/` and `cargo bench` from
`benchmark/` on every push/PR to `main`. Match these locally before pushing.

## High-Level Architecture

EKOS is a **compiler for enterprise knowledge**, not a database or document store. It observes
enterprise systems without interpreting them, compiles those observations through deterministic
passes into a Canonical Knowledge Model, and stores the result in an append-only ledger where
every conclusion carries the evidence it was derived from.

```
Enterprise Systems → Observation Layer → Knowledge Compiler → Canonical Knowledge Model (CKM)
                                                                          ↓
                              AI/Apps ← Knowledge Runtime (read-only) ← Semantic Knowledge Ledger
```

This maps directly onto the `ekos init/build/recover/resolve/compile/commit` CLI pipeline: each
verb is a compiler stage, run in that order, writing artifacts the next stage consumes.

### Crate map (`ekos/crates/`)

| Crate | Role |
|---|---|
| `compiler-core` | `Compiler`, `PassManager`, `Scheduler`, `Diagnostics`, `EkosConfig` — the pipeline that drives every pass over a `PassContext` |
| `compiler-sdk` | Public traits for extending the compiler |
| `observation-sdk` | `Observer` trait — the contract every connector implements, returning an `ObservationPackage` of content-addressable `ObservationArtifact`s |
| `artifact` | Artifact types + `ArtifactStore` (loose JSON, or packed segments post RFC 0015) |
| `kir` | Knowledge Intermediate Representation — the typed output of knowledge-recovery passes, input to the semantic compiler |
| `recovery` | Knowledge-recovery passes: one analyzer per source kind (`sql_analyzer` — DDL, `sql_transform_analyzer` — SELECT/VIEW/procedures into the Transformation IR, `pentaho_analyzer`, `git_analyzer`, `github_analyzer`, `confluence_analyzer`, `local_docs_analyzer`, `document_semantics_analyzer`, `crypto_analyzer`, `dependency_analyzer`, `python_analyzer` — RFC 0038/0040, real AST + `Calls`-adjacent structural recovery: SQLAlchemy ORM models promoted to real `Table` objects (`__tablename__` present, same-file-only `ForeignKey` resolution, RFC 0091) and real class inheritance as `RelationshipKind::Extends` edges (same-file-only base resolution, RFC 0092), `rust_analyzer` — real AST + `Calls` graph, RFC 0041, `crate_topology_analyzer`/`cicd_analyzer` — `Cargo.toml`/GitHub Actions structural parsing, RFC 0042, `dbt_analyzer` — static extraction of `Table` objects from a dbt project's own checked-in `.sql` model files (Jinja `ref()`/`source()` macro calls) plus `schema.yml`/`sources.yml`-shaped YAML, never `manifest.json`/live warehouse introspection, RFC 0117), `elixir_analyzer`/`javascript_analyzer` (real AST + module/symbol/`Calls` recovery), `architecture_evaluator.rs` (`evaluate_architecture`, RFC 0065 Phase 3 — deterministic completeness/evidence-coverage scoring, no LLM; consumed by both `ekos architecture investigate` and `docs generate`'s Executive Summary, RFC 0095), `architecture_reasoning.rs` (RFC 0065 Phase 2 — LLM crate-role classification), plus LLM provider glue (`anthropic.rs`, `ollama.rs`, `llm.rs`), `embed.rs` (RFC 0125 — `EmbeddingProvider` trait + Mock/Ollama/OpenAI/Cached impls + the opt-in post-`commit` `embed_objects` vector pass) and `llm_description.rs` (RFC 0088 — a post-`commit` step, not a `CompilerPass`, that persists real evidence-grounded `ai_overview`/`ai_usage`/`ai_comment_check` properties onto `Module`/`Rollup`/`Symbol` objects directly through `&dyn KnowledgeStore`; runs after `commit_rollups`/`commit_data_lineage`, opt-in via `[llm-description]`) |
| `identity` | Identity Resolution — `DefaultResolver` merges same-source-kind duplicates before the CKM exists (RFC 0007), but only when a group's normalized names match *exactly*; fuzzy matches (no confidence threshold reliably separates real correct fuzzy merges from real incorrect ones — RFC 0060) instead become reviewable `unconfirmed` `SameAs` relationships, same as `cross_system.rs`'s cross-system candidates (RFC 0029/0063), never a silent irreversible merge. `cross_system.rs` separately scores cross-system candidate matches (RFC 0029), written as reviewable `unconfirmed` relationships, never auto-merged. **New `ObjectKind::Custom(_)` variants an analyzer emits must be declared in `ekos_kir::custom_kinds::REGISTRY`** with `structurally_keyed` set — `true` for a kind self-identified by a structural key (file path, manifest dir, source+index): `DefaultResolver` derives its merge-exclusion set from that flag (RFC 0135 Part D), so a keyed kind is never a merge candidate. `Section`/`TransformNode`/`RustSymbol`/`RustModule`/`PythonSymbol`/`PythonModule`/`Crate`/`ElixirModule`/`ElixirSymbol`/`JsModule`/`JsSymbol`/`Document`/`Page`/`Risk`/`Rollup`/`ProjectSummary`/`Claim`/`ArchitectureGap` all hit (or would hit) the same over-merge failure — name-prefix or exact-name similarity + the same-kind structural-score fallback of 1.0. The `ekos-identity` test `every_pipeline_custom_kind_is_registered` now fails CI if a new `recover`/`compile` `Custom` kind skips the registry, so this is enforced, not remembered — but still set the flag correctly when you add the row. Separately, `is_expected_technology_jsmodule_pair` (RFC 0093) narrows — never widens — the cross-kind *conflict* detector (not the merge path above) for the one specific, mechanically-expected co-existence a `Technology` (declared dependency) and a bare-specifier `JsModule` (real import) sharing a name represents; a relative-specifier `JsModule` still conflicts. |
| `semantic` | Semantic compiler: KIR + resolved identities → CKM; `transform_ir.rs` is the shared Transformation IR (RFC 0027) every legacy-format parser (Pentaho, SQL) compiles into. `concentration_risks` (RFC 0094) derives real, persisted `Custom("Risk")` objects — `risk_type: "observed"` only, no LLM/inferred severity — for any object with 3+ real compiled `DependsOn` dependents, computed inside `SemanticCompilerPass::run()` (needs the whole-graph `DependsOn` view only available post-resolution, but — unlike RFC 0044's rollups — no `File`-object dependency to defer to `ekos commit` for) |
| `ledger` | Append-only Semantic Knowledge Ledger — `fact.rs`/`fact_ledger.rs` (facts), `index.rs`, `search.rs`, `vector.rs` (RFC 0125 brute-force cosine vector index, opt-in), `retrieval.rs` (RFC 0119 the `retrieve` seam + `rrf_fuse`), `partitioned/` (RFC 0111 single-machine partitioning). RFC 0016's fact-segment engine (tantivy + mmap) is the default for **new** workspaces as of 2026-08-21 (`crates/cli/src/commands/store.rs::open_store`, real month-long soak evidence in the RFC's own dated section); any **pre-existing** SQLite-backed workspace keeps serving from SQLite unaffected unless explicitly migrated via `ekos ledger migrate --v3` |
| `segment-backend`, `cluster`, `distributed` | RFC 0111 Phase A (partitioned storage) + RFC 0113 Phase B (distributed, v1 feature-complete 2026-08-30). `segment-backend` is the storage-backend seam (`SegmentBackend` trait: local FS or object store); `cluster` is the coordinator + `compile-worker` lease/heartbeat protocol; `distributed` is the query-worker RPC layer + `DistributedLedger` gateway (per-shard IDF merge → RRF). Object-store read path verified live against MinIO + a 95-partition Elixir workspace (`devlog_144`). |
| `runtime` | Read-only state reconstruction and context projection. `ai.rs` is the `ekos ask` grounding+citation pipeline; `retrieval.rs` is RFC 0121 query understanding (`understand` → `QueryType`); `reason.rs` is RFC 0123's Query Plan IR + rules planner + typed `EvidenceSet`; `retrieval_eval.rs` is RFC 0126's CI-gated retrieval quality harness. |
| `ekl` | Enterprise Knowledge Language — `parser.rs` + `interpreter.rs` for the `ekos ekl` query command. Supports `AS OF <ts>` / `COUNT` / `GROUP BY` (RFC 0096) and `SEMANTIC 'text' [LIMIT k]` retrieval candidate sets (RFC 0124). |
| `docs-gen` | Deterministic Markdown/HTML rendering from the compiled ledger (RFC 0035) — `render_object_page` (`--layout objects`, one page per significant object) and `render_readme`/`render_architecture`/`render_api`/`render_sequence_diagrams` (`--layout curated`, RFC 0037/0042) — zero LLM calls; `render_dependency_risk_report`/`render_onboarding_guide`/`render_findings_memo` (`--layout solution-architect`, RFC 0090) for a team-handoff bundle; `--prose` (opt-in) is the one path that layers an LLM overview on top, via `ekos ask`'s own grounding+citation pipeline. `render_architecture_summary`'s Executive Summary renders real `Custom("Risk")` objects (RFC 0094) and an `ArchitectureConfidence` score (RFC 0095, a small local struct mirroring `ekos_recovery::EvaluationReport` rather than a real cross-crate dependency — `cli` does the translation) when the caller has real signal, an honest placeholder otherwise — never a fabricated 100%. |
| `dbt-gen` | Renders the Transformation IR (RFC 0027) into executable dbt SQL models with `ref()` semantics |
| `marketing` | Devlog → tweet → human approval → X publish (RFC 0030) — auxiliary tooling outside the compiler pipeline, not a `CompilerPass`/`Observer` |
| `simulation` | World Engine (RFC 0047-0055) — auxiliary, opt-in, deliberately separate from the compiler pipeline above: `action.rs`/`decision.rs`/`simulation.rs` (a closed 12-action vocabulary, a provider-independent `DecisionEngine` trait, a deterministic round-based loop with seeded priority/resource conflict resolution), `scenario.rs` (YAML scenario/agent definitions, `ekos simulate`'s loader), `forum.rs` (channels/replies/likes/follows/shares), `replay.rs` (a durable per-ledger event log + point-in-time reconstruction, `ekos replay`), `ingest.rs` (`world.sources`: real documents via the actual `localdocs` connector + `LocalDocAnalyzerPass`, no LLM). Writes through `&dyn KnowledgeStore` directly, the same access level `commit.rs` has — `Runtime` stays read-only throughout, unmodified by this crate. Every RFC in this crate builds additively on existing KIR/ledger primitives (`Custom()` escape hatches, `properties` conventions) rather than inventing new storage |
| `cli` | `commands/` — one file per CLI subcommand, dispatched from `crates/cli/src/app.rs` (`main_with`; `bin/ekos.rs` is a shim); also hosts the MCP server (`commands/mcp.rs`) and `extension.rs`, the RFC 0149 extension seam (`EkosExtension`: extra observers, recover passes, a post-commit step, MCP tools) that out-of-tree builds plug into |
| `common` | Shared utilities — `ContentHash`, zstd compression, and `redaction` (RFC 0043: built-in, non-disable-able secrets/PII pattern table + excluded-file globs, the single module both `build.rs` and `recover.rs`'s direct-file-read blocks call before anything reaches the artifact store or ledger) |
| `scheduler`, `sql-dialect-sdk` | Pass scheduling primitives; the `SqlDialectParser` trait every `plugins/sql-dialect-*` crate implements (RFC 0031) |

### Connectors (`ekos/plugins/`)

Each plugin implements `Observer` from `observation-sdk` and is registered independently in
`ekos/Cargo.toml`'s workspace members. Real/tested: `file`, `git`, `github`, `confluence`,
`localdocs` (PDF/DOCX/text/Markdown/HTML/email), `pentaho` (`.ktr`/`.kjb`, RFC 0027), `crypto`,
`python` (real AST + PySpark DataFrame chains into the Transformation IR, RFC 0038/0040), `rust`
(real AST + the first real `Calls` function-call graph, RFC 0041), `elixir`/`javascript` (real
AST + `Calls` recovery), `clickhouse` (real HTTP client, schema metadata + the opt-in live
NL-to-SQL query engine, RFC 0056). `sql-dialect-{postgres,mysql,mssql,snowflake,databricks,clickhouse}`
implement the `SqlDialectParser` trait (RFC 0031).
**Not in this repo:** RFC 0148's compiled .NET/JVM binary decompiler (readers, observer, analyzer pass,
`[binary-reconstruction]`, `ekos_binary_explain`) lives in the private `alexeyban/ekos-binary` workspace as
an RFC 0149 extension with its own `ekos` binary. Public EKOS keeps only the `[binary-reconstruction]`
config schema, the `Binary*` custom-kind registry rows and identity's binary narrowing, so a ledger a
private build wrote still resolves and queries here. Public crates must never depend on it.

Scaffolded proof-of-concept only (mock API shapes, not exercised against live accounts):
`salesforce`, `sap`, `oracle`, `fabric`, `snowflake`.

`crate_topology_analyzer`/`cicd_analyzer` (RFC 0042, in `recovery`, not `plugins/`) and the
dependency-scan block in `recover.rs` are a second, separate raw-content entry point — they walk
`observe_paths` and call `std::fs::read_to_string` directly rather than going through an
`Observer`/`ArtifactStore` round-trip. Both entry points (the `Observer`-based one and this direct
one) independently run RFC 0043's redaction pass before any content is persisted — see `common`'s
crate-map entry.

### Key invariants (enforced by review, not just convention)

- The ledger is **append-only** — knowledge is never modified in place.
- Every semantic conclusion must be traceable to **Evidence** (one of the four primitives:
  Object, Relationship, Event, Evidence).
- The Runtime is **read-only** — it reconstructs state, never modifies it.
- AI systems consume knowledge through the Runtime only (in practice, through `ekos mcp serve`,
  RFC 0013) — they never touch raw enterprise systems directly.
- Compiler passes must be **deterministic** and **side-effect-free**.
- Artifacts are **content-addressable** (id + checksum + metadata + dependencies + version).
- **Secrets/PII are never observed or stored** (RFC 0043) — a built-in redaction baseline
  (`ekos_common::redaction`) runs at every raw-content entry point; `ekos.toml`'s `[security]`
  section can only extend it, never disable it. Because the ledger is append-only, this has to be
  a prevention control, not a cleanup step — there is no way to un-commit something already
  ledgered (confirmed: no object-level delete/tombstone exists anywhere in the codebase).

### AI agent access (MCP)

`ekos mcp serve --workspace <dir>` exposes the Runtime read-only over stdio via newline-delimited
JSON-RPC 2.0 (also `--tcp <addr>` for multiple clients on one server, RFC 0115). Tools:
`ekos_search` (`mode` `lexical`/`vector`/`hybrid`, RFC 0124/0125), `ekos_query` / `ekos_retrieve`
(compiled fact+graph answer and the inspectable query plan / evidence set, no LLM — RFC 0124),
`ekos_ekl`, `ekos_neighborhood`, `ekos_state`, `ekos_dependents`, `ekos_impact` (multi-hop,
RFC 0018), `ekos_diff`, `ekos_status`, `ekos_transformation_explain`/`ekos_transformation_diff`
(Transformation IR, RFC 0028), `ekos_architecture_evaluate`/`ekos_architecture_drift`/`ekos_architecture_diff`
(RFC 0065/0107-0109), the gated `ekos_clickhouse_query` (live NL-to-SQL, off by default, RFC 0056),
and the two write-capable review tools `ekos_identity_review` (confirm/reject a candidate identity
match — cross-system, RFC 0029, or same-source fuzzy, RFC 0063; the tool doesn't distinguish
origin, only `Custom("SameAs")` kind) and `ekos_architecture_review` (confirm/reject an
LLM-classified crate role, RFC 0109). Every other tool is read-only, going through `Runtime`
only. This repo's own `.claude/skills/ekos-knowledge` and `.claude/skills/memory` skills consume
this server — an older scripted walkthrough of the whole pipeline is archived under `archive/demo/`
for historical reference (no longer actively maintained against current CLI behavior).

### LLM-backed passes

`recovery`'s analyzer passes that call an LLM (document semantics, some SQL/Git recovery) go
through the `LlmProvider` trait (`recovery/src/llm.rs`), with `anthropic.rs` and `ollama.rs`
implementations selected via `[llm]` in `ekos.toml`. Treat this as a Claude-relevant provider
boundary — check `recovery/src/llm.rs` before assuming request/response shapes.

## Mandatory Development Workflow

Every task follows this sequence — do not skip steps:

1. **Design** — write an RFC in `docs/rfcs/NNNN-<topic>.md` before any code
2. **Architecture Review** — validate against the compiler model above
3. **Interfaces** — define public traits and types first
4. **Tests** — write tests before implementation
5. **Implementation**
6. **Refactoring**
7. **Documentation** — every public API must be documented
8. **Integration**
9. **Benchmark** — required for performance-relevant changes (see `benchmark/`)
10. **Merge**

No feature is implemented until its RFC is accepted. RFCs are authored **just-in-time**, before
the phase that needs them, not all up front (see `TODO.md` Phase -1 for the rationale).

## PR Checklist

Every PR must satisfy: tests passing, documentation, benchmarks (performance-relevant changes
only), no public API break, compiler diagnostics, logging, examples.

## Coding Rules

- Rust 2024 edition
- Zero `unsafe` unless formally justified in an RFC
- No global mutable state
- Dependency injection through traits (`Observer`, `LlmProvider`, `CompilerPass`, `ArtifactStore`, …)
- Every artifact must be serializable
- Pure functions wherever possible
- Reproducible builds

## Devlog Rule

**`devlogs/devlog_N.md` files are the project's long-term memory.** They are the primary source of
truth for project history, architecture decisions, production incidents, and non-obvious knowledge.
Treat them as the first thing to read, not the last thing to write.

**After any session with significant changes, generate a new `devlogs/devlog_N.md`.**

Significant = any of: new feature shipped, bug found and fixed, architecture decision made,
non-obvious knowledge captured, production incident, or a set of PRs merged in one session.
Minor chores (typo fixes, dependency bumps) alone do not warrant a devlog entry — fold them
into the next substantive one.

### Filename

Increment from the highest existing `devlogs/devlog_N.md`: `devlog_43.md` → `devlog_44.md`, etc.

### Required sections

```markdown
# Devlog N — <short title>

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**PRs:** #N, #N+1, …
**Branch:** <branch> → <target> (merged / squash-merged)

---

## Summary
<2–5 sentence overview: what changed and why it mattered>

---

## PR #N — <title>

### Problem / motivation
### What was built  (table of components if >3 items)
### Implementation details worth remembering
### Decisions (alternatives considered, why this choice)

(repeat for each PR)

---

## Knowledge Captured
<Non-obvious facts, gotchas, SDK quirks, production behaviour, or patterns
 that should not be re-discovered from scratch. Each item should answer:
 "What would a future developer need to know to avoid the same mistake?">

---

## Files Changed
| File | Change summary |
```

### What belongs in "Knowledge Captured"

- SDK/library quirks that aren't in the docs
- Production-only behaviour
- Decisions with non-obvious rationale
- Cost/latency benchmarks discovered in practice
- Debugging techniques that were hard to find

### After writing the devlog

1. Also update `TODO.md` to tick off completed items for the day's work
2. Update `README.md` if any user-facing behaviour changed
3. **Update `docs/generated/ekos-self-documentation.html`** — the human-readable, comprehensive
   capabilities reference published at
   [alexeyban.github.io/EKOS/generated/ekos-self-documentation.html](https://alexeyban.github.io/EKOS/generated/ekos-self-documentation.html).
   If the devlog shipped a new capability, a new CLI command/flag, a new MCP tool, or changed how
   an existing one behaves, add or update that capability's own section there — this page is meant
   to stay a complete, current, human-readable description of the whole project and every aspect of
   it, not a point-in-time snapshot. A devlog that's purely an internal fix/refactor with no
   user-visible capability change doesn't need an update here (same bar as the README update in
   step 2). Pushing this file (it lives under `docs/`) redeploys the live page automatically via
   `.github/workflows/pages.yml`.
4. Commit everything in one PR: `chore: devlog_N, README + TODO + capabilities doc update for <topic>`
