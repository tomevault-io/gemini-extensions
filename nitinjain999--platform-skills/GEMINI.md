Provides structured diagnosis with blast radius, validation steps, and rollback plan for: Kubernetes, Flux CD, Argo CD, Terraform, GitHub Actions (composite actions, OIDC, SHA pinning), AWS, Azure, GKE, Linkerd, KEDA, Karpenter, supply chain security (Cosign, SBOM, SLSA), Falco, Chaos Engineering, DORA metrics, Datadog/Dynatrace/LLM observability, SOC 2, and PR review.


# Platform Skills

Use this skill for hands-on help with Kubernetes, GitOps, cloud infrastructure, CI/CD, secrets management, service mesh, Linux administration, networking, and platform product thinking — whether you are a solo developer or part of a large platform team.

If a task spans multiple areas, decide which layer owns the source of truth and keep the other layers consumers of that state.

## Apply These Platform Rules

- Separate reusable platform building blocks from live environment configuration.
- Prefer GitOps pull-based reconciliation for cluster state and CI push-based automation for validation and packaging.
- Choose either Flux or Argo CD for a given ownership boundary unless the task is explicitly about migration between them.
- Keep Terraform responsible for bootstrapping clusters, cloud resources, secrets backends, and access primitives. Do not let Flux or Argo CD recreate those foundations unless there is a deliberate controller-based design.
- Use Flux or Argo CD for in-cluster add-ons, workloads, Helm releases, and app-level environment promotion after bootstrap.
- Use GitHub Actions for checks, plans, policy gates, artifact publishing, and promotion orchestration. Do not store long-lived environment truth in workflow YAML.
- Prefer OIDC or workload identity over static cloud credentials.
- Model environments explicitly. Promotion should be visible in Git history and reversible by commit rollback.
- For Linux and networking changes, validate at each layer before escalating: confirm the process is listening (`ss -tulnp`), then L3 reachability (`ping`), L4 connectivity (`nc -zv`), L7 response (`curl -v`), and security group / NACL rules last. Do not skip layers.
- For every Terraform change, enforce in order: `terraform fmt -check -recursive`, `terraform validate`, `conftest test` (OPA/Rego policy gates — runs **after validate, before plan** as a blocking gate), `tflint --recursive`, security scan (`tfsec` or `checkov`), then `plan`. Do not let format, lint, or policy failures reach the plan step.
- For every Helm chart change, enforce in order: `helm lint --strict`, `helm template --debug`, `kubeconform -strict -summary` on rendered output, `checkov` on rendered manifests, then `helm test` in-cluster. Fail CI on any `helm lint --strict` warning.
- Enforce a tag baseline on all cloud resources. The specific keys are an organizational decision. Use AWS `default_tags` (provider level) or Azure `merge(local.common_tags, {...})` (module local) so the baseline is applied once, not repeated per resource. Back it with AWS Tag Policies or Azure Policy so resources created outside Terraform are also covered.

## Structure the Response

For design or implementation work, provide output in this order:

1. Target architecture and ownership boundaries
2. Repository or directory layout
3. Identity, secrets, and promotion model
4. Validation and deployment workflow
5. Risks, tradeoffs, and migration path

When asked to generate code, start from the thinnest useful slice that proves the pattern and note which layer remains intentionally out of scope.
