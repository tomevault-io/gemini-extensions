# AGENTS.md
Guidance for autonomous coding agents working in this repository.

## 1) Project snapshot
- Project: `ocp` (OpenCode Configuration Profiles CLI)
- Stack: Java 25, Micronaut 4.x, Picocli, Gradle Kotlin DSL, JUnit 5
- Packaging: single-module Gradle application
- Main class: `com.github.alvarosanchez.ocp.command.OcpCommand`
- Source root package: `com.github.alvarosanchez.ocp`
- Behavior contract: `SPEC.md` is the product truth source

## 2) Repository policy files
- Cursor rules: no `.cursorrules` and no `.cursor/rules/**` found
- Copilot rules: no `.github/copilot-instructions.md` found
- If these files are added later, treat them as higher-priority agent instructions

## 3) Build, test, and verification commands
Run from repo root: `/Users/alvaro/Dev/alvarosanchez/ocp`.

### Core lifecycle
- Build: `./gradlew build`
- Full verification: `./gradlew check`
- JVM tests: `./gradlew test`
- Native binary compile: `./gradlew nativeCompile`
- Native tests: `./gradlew nativeTest`
- Show CLI help through Gradle app plugin: `./gradlew run --args="help"`

### Single test execution (important)
- One class:
  - `./gradlew test --tests com.github.alvarosanchez.ocp.service.ProfileServiceTest`
- One method:
  - `./gradlew test --tests com.github.alvarosanchez.ocp.service.ProfileServiceTest.getAllProfilesReturnsSortedUniqueNames`
- Pattern selection:
  - `./gradlew test --tests "*ProfileCommandTest*"`

### Useful support commands
- List tasks: `./gradlew tasks --all`
- Compile only (quick type-check proxy): `./gradlew compileJava`
- Clean outputs: `./gradlew clean`

## 4) Lint and static-analysis reality
- No dedicated lint task is configured in `build.gradle.kts`
- No Spotless / PMD / Gradle Checkstyle plugin is configured
- IntelliJ Checkstyle plugin config exists at `.idea/checkstyle-idea.xml`
- Practical quality baseline for agents: `./gradlew check`

## 5) Directory map
- Production Java: `src/main/java/com/github/alvarosanchez/ocp/**`
- Tests: `src/test/java/com/github/alvarosanchez/ocp/**`
- Resources: `src/main/resources/**`
- Build config: `build.gradle.kts`, `settings.gradle.kts`, `gradle/libs.versions.toml`
- Product spec and acceptance criteria: `SPEC.md`

## 6) Architecture boundaries and responsibilities
- `command/`: Picocli commands, argument handling, exit-code orchestration, user messages
- `service/`: domain logic and orchestration across repositories/profiles
- `git/`: external `git` process execution wrappers
- `config/`: serde models for registry/repository metadata files
- `model/`: immutable read models for command rendering

Rule of thumb: keep command classes thin; move business logic to services.

## 7) Code style conventions (observed in source)

### Formatting and structure
- 4-space indentation, braces on same line
- Prefer straightforward loops/conditionals over clever abstractions
- Keep methods readable; extract helpers for repeated logic
- Avoid wildcard imports

### Imports
- Standard ordering in this repo is mixed; preserve local file ordering style
- Use explicit imports; static imports are common in tests for assertions
- Avoid introducing unused imports and large import churn

### Types, immutability, and visibility
- Prefer `record` for DTO/config projections (`config/`, `model/`, and local helper records)
- Normalize immutable collections with `List.copyOf` / `Set.copyOf` / `List.of`
- Use `final` classes for core services and utility types when extension is not intended
- Default to package-private constructors/methods unless API must be public

### Naming
- Types/records/enums: `PascalCase`
- Methods/fields/locals: `camelCase`
- Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
- Tests: descriptive `camelCase` method names
- Command names and messages should align with `SPEC.md` CLI terminology

### Javadoc and API documentation
- Public classes and public methods generally include Javadoc
- Preserve this standard when adding new public API surface
- Keep Javadoc concise and behavior-focused (params, return, failure mode)

## 8) Error handling conventions
- Never swallow exceptions silently
- Wrap I/O failures with context (`UncheckedIOException` or `IllegalStateException`)
- Include operation and path/URI in exception messages where possible
- For `InterruptedException`, always restore interrupt status with `Thread.currentThread().interrupt()`
- Commands catch domain/runtime exceptions, print to `stderr`, and return non-zero

## 9) CLI output and exit-code conventions
- Success/info output uses `stdout`
- Errors use `stderr`
- Expected exit codes:
  - `0`: success
  - `1`: runtime/validation failure
  - `2`: command usage error
- Root/group commands should print usage/help when no subcommand is provided

## 10) Micronaut and DI conventions
- Stateless services/clients use `@Singleton`
- Prefer constructor injection (including package-private constructors)
- Keep constructors dependency-only and avoid side effects

## 11) Test conventions
- JUnit 5 platform (`useJUnitPlatform()`)
- `@TempDir` is standard for filesystem isolation
- Use explicit setup/teardown for system properties in tests
- Validate both behavior and CLI contract (exit code + stdout/stderr content)
- Keep tests deterministic and independent
- Use private helper methods inside each test class for fixtures

## 12) Filesystem and config assumptions
- Default registry file: `~/.config/ocp/config.json`
- Default repository storage root: `~/.config/ocp`
- Default OpenCode config target: `~/.config/opencode`
- Common system property overrides:
  - `ocp.config.dir`
  - `ocp.cache.dir` (legacy storage override)
  - `ocp.opencode.config.dir`
  - `ocp.working.dir`

## 13) Agent workflow expectations

### Before coding
- Read nearby classes in the same package and related tests first
- Check `SPEC.md` acceptance criteria for user-visible behavior changes
- Keep changes minimal, cohesive, and scoped to the request
- Before making any file edits, create and switch to a dedicated working branch (for example `git checkout -b agent/<topic>`); never start work on `master` or `main`.
- Never create test repositories, fixture directories, or nested git repositories inside the project working tree; use `@TempDir` or system temporary directories outside the checkout instead unless the user explicitly requests an in-repo fixture.


### After coding
- Minimum verification: `./gradlew test`
- If startup/native-sensitive behavior changed: `./gradlew nativeTest`
- If wiring/build behavior changed: `./gradlew build`
- If CLI or other user-visible behavior changed, update `SPEC.md` and the affected user-facing documentation in the same change set (site docs under `site/src/content/docs/**`, plus `README.md` when landing-page messaging or quickstart guidance changes).
- Ask the user if they want to create a PR with the "gh" CLI. If granted permission, create it.
- Do not merge the PR until GitHub Copilot has posted its review on that PR.
- Address every Copilot review comment, and confirm there are no unresolved Copilot comments.
- If Copilot review is still pending or missing, keep waiting and polling; do not merge yet.
- After Copilot comments are resolved, monitor CI checks and merge only when required checks pass.
- If CI fails, investigate failures and fix them before merging.

## 14) Do / don't checklist
Do:
- Keep architecture boundaries intact (`command` thin, `service` rich)
- Add or update tests for behavior changes
- Preserve transactionality and rollback behavior in profile switch flows
- Keep user-facing error messages actionable and context-rich

Don't:
- Add unrelated refactors in bugfix changes
- Introduce silent failure paths or empty catches
- Add dependencies without clear need
- Change documented behavior without updating `SPEC.md`
- Hardcode dependencies in the build script (use the version catalog instead)
- Commit or push unless explicitly requested by the user
