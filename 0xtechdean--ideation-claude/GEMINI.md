```

**Two-Phase Validation**: Problem validation MUST pass before solution validation runs!

**Early Elimination**: If problem_score < 6.0 OR market_timing < 4, skip solution phase and go directly to report with pivot suggestions.

**Kill Switches (v2.0)**: Three hard gates that auto-fail regardless of scores:
1. **Competitor Kill**: Funded competitor ($20M+) already has the exact product
2. **Regulatory Kill**: Core value proposition legally prohibited or requires $500K+/12mo+ licensing
3. **Timing Kill**: Market at <2% penetration with no paying customers today

## How You Are Triggered

A user asks you to validate a startup problem:
```
Validate the problem: "Legal research is too time-consuming and expensive for small law firms"
```

## Model Requirements

**ALWAYS use Opus 4.5** (`model: opus`) for all ideation flow agents and tasks. This ensures:
- Highest quality market research and analysis
- Best reasoning for scoring and decision-making
- Most comprehensive report generation

All sub-agents in `.claude/agents/` are configured with `model: opus`.

## Research Source Requirements

**CRITICAL: All agents MUST use non-promotional sources and include relevant quotes.**

### Preferred Sources (Use These)
| Type | Examples |
|------|----------|
| Research Reports | MIT, Gartner, Forrester, McKinsey, IDC |
| Industry Publications | HBR, TechCrunch, VentureBeat, The Information |
| Government/NGO | EU regulations, NIST, CSA, OWASP |
| News Outlets | Reuters, Bloomberg, WSJ, Financial Times |

### Avoid These Sources
| Type | Why |
|------|-----|
| Vendor blogs | Promotional bias |
| Product pages | Sales material |
| Press releases | Self-serving |
| Sponsored content | Paid placement |

### Quote Requirements
- Extract 4+ relevant quotes per report
- Format: `> "Quote text" — Source Name, Date`
- Focus on: pain points, market stats, expert opinions
- Include sources table with type classification

## Autonomous Execution with Ralph-Wiggum

**IMPORTANT**: When running the ideation flow, ALWAYS use the ralph-wiggum plugin for autonomous execution:

```
/ralph-loop "Validate the problem: {problem}" --max-iterations 30
```

This ensures the entire pipeline runs to completion without manual intervention between phases. The flow will:
1. Initialize session (and Mem0 if configured)
2. Run Phase 1 agents in parallel
3. Calculate scores and make elimination decision
4. Run Phase 2 if problem passes
5. Generate report
6. Save to file (and send to Slack if configured)
7. Present summary to user

To stop early if needed: `/cancel-ralph`

## The 5 Native Sub-Agents

Located in `.claude/agents/`:

| Agent | File | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| **discovery-engine** | `discovery-engine.md` | Mine 5 sources for pain signals, cluster into problem themes |
| **market-researcher** | `market-researcher.md` | Market trends, pain points, TAM/SAM/SOM |
| **customer-solution** | `customer-solution.md` | Customer segments, Mom Test, MVP design |
| **feasibility-scorer** | `feasibility-scorer.md` | Competition, tech feasibility, scoring (pass/fail) |
| **report-pivot** | `report-pivot.md` | Final report with pivot suggestions if eliminated |

## Orchestration Flow

### Step 1: Initialize Session

Generate a unique session ID and detect available integrations:

```python
import json
import random
import string
import subprocess

session_id = ''.join(random.choices(string.ascii_lowercase + string.digits, k=8))

# Detect available integrations — reads from shell env AND .env file
result = subprocess.run(
    ["python3", "scripts/detect_integrations.py"],
    capture_output=True, text=True
)
integrations = json.loads(result.stdout)
use_mem0 = integrations["use_mem0"]
use_slack = integrations["use_slack"]

# Initialize Mem0 (only if configured)
if use_mem0:
    from mem0 import MemoryClient
    client = MemoryClient(api_key=integrations["MEM0_API_KEY"])
    client.add(
        f"Session initialized for problem: {problem}",
        user_id=f"ideation_orchestrator_{session_id}",
        metadata={
            "type": "session_init",
            "session_id": session_id,
            "problem": problem,
            "threshold": 6.0,
            "status": "started"
        }
    )
```

### Phase 1: PROBLEM VALIDATION (Parallel)

Use the **Task tool** to launch both problem validation agents in PARALLEL:

```
Task 1: market-researcher
- Prompt: Analyze market for "{problem}" with session_id={session_id}
- Mem0 persistence: {enabled if use_mem0 else disabled}
- Research market trends and calculate TAM/SAM/SOM
- Score: Market Size (1-10), Market Timing (1-10) ← NEW v2.0
- Write findings + market timing score to Mem0

Task 2: customer-solution
- Prompt: Analyze customers for "{problem}" with session_id={session_id}
- Mem0 persistence: {enabled if use_mem0 else disabled}
- Identify customer segments, pain points, willingness to pay
- Score: Solution Fit (1-10), WTP with evidence tier classification ← NEW v2.0
- Classify WTP evidence as Tier 1/2/3 and cap score accordingly
- Write findings + WTP tier + capped score to Mem0
```

**After both complete, calculate PROBLEM SCORE (v2.0):**
```python
# Cap WTP based on evidence tier from customer-solution agent
# Tier 1: max 10, Tier 2: max 7, Tier 3: max 4
wtp_capped = min(wtp_raw, wtp_tier_max)

# Problem Score = average of 5 criteria (equal 20% weight each)
problem_score = (pain_severity + startup_addressability + market_size + wtp_capped + market_timing) / 5
```

### DECISION POINT: Early Elimination

```python
# Check market timing first (< 4 = early elimination)
if market_timing < 4:
    decision = "fail"
    combined_score = problem_score * 0.55
    reason = "MARKET TIMING ELIMINATION"
elif problem_score < 6.0:
    # ELIMINATE - Skip solution validation
    decision = "fail"
    combined_score = problem_score * 0.55  # Only problem score counts
else:
    # CONTINUE to Phase 2
    decision = "continue"
```

### Phase 2: SOLUTION VALIDATION (Only if problem passes!)

**ONLY RUN IF problem_score >= 6.0**

```
Task 3: feasibility-scorer
- Prompt: Evaluate solution feasibility for "{problem}" with session_id={session_id}
- Mem0 persistence: {enabled if use_mem0 else disabled}
- **Run kill switch gates FIRST** (competitor, regulatory, timing)
- Analyze competition and market gaps
- Assess technical feasibility and resource requirements
- Score: Technical Viability, Competitive Advantage (≤3 = auto-fail), Resource Requirements, Time to Market
- Score: Pain Severity, Startup Addressability (NEW - how viable for new entrant)
- Write solution_score + kill switch results to Mem0
```

**After completion, calculate COMBINED SCORE (v2.0):**
```python
# Check kill switches first — any triggered = AUTO-FAIL
if any_kill_switch_triggered:
    verdict = "FAIL"
    reason = f"KILL SWITCH: {triggered_gate}"

# Check competitive advantage floor
elif competitive_advantage <= 3:
    verdict = "FAIL"
    reason = "CA FLOOR: exact product exists with significant funding"

# Combined = (Problem × 55%) + (Solution × 45%)
else:
    combined_score = (problem_score * 0.55) + (solution_score * 0.45)

    if combined_score >= 6.5:
        verdict = "PASS"
    elif combined_score >= 6.0:
        # Smart mediocrity check for marginal passes
        # Count: CA≤5, WTP Tier 3, Timing<6, Competitor $50M+
        # 3+ red flags = FAIL, 2 = CONDITIONAL, 0-1 = PASS
        verdict = smart_mediocrity_check(...)
    else:
        verdict = "FAIL"
```

### Phase 3: Report Generation

Always run report-pivot (it includes pivot suggestions if eliminated):

```
Task 4: report-pivot
- Prompt: Generate report for "{problem}" with session_id={session_id}
- Mem0 persistence: {enabled if use_mem0 else disabled}
- Compile all phase outputs
- If verdict="FAIL": Include 3-5 pivot suggestions
```

### Phase 4: Save Report to File

After the report-pivot agent completes, **save the full report to a markdown file**:

```
File: reports/{sanitized_problem_name}-{session_id}.md

Example: reports/ai-qa-paradox-evaluation-g4ael8p0.md
```

The report should include all sections:
- Session Information (ID, date, status, score)
- Executive Summary
- Scores Summary table
- Market Analysis (TAM/SAM/SOM, trends, stats)
- Competitive Landscape (key competitors, gaps, advantages)
- Key Risks & Mitigations
- Sources/References

Use the **Write tool** to save the report file.

### Phase 5: Send Report to Slack (if configured)

**Only run if `use_slack` is true** (both `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` and `SLACK_CHANNEL_ID` are set).

If Slack is not configured, skip this phase entirely. The report is already saved to disk in Phase 4.

**IMPORTANT**: Slack uses `mrkdwn` format, NOT standard Markdown. Always convert before sending!

| Markdown | Slack mrkdwn |
|----------|--------------|
| `**bold**` | `*bold*` |
| `## Header` | `*Header*` |
| `[text](url)` | `<url\|text>` |
| Tables | Wrap in \`\`\` code blocks |

#### Step 1: Send Summary (Block Kit)

```python
from scripts.slack_helpers import send_evaluation_report

send_evaluation_report(
    session_id=session_id,
    problem=problem,
    score=combined_score,
    verdict=verdict,
    tam=tam,
    som=som,
    primary_segment=segment,
    key_gap=gap,
    report_path=report_path,
    next_steps=next_steps
)
```

#### Step 2: Send Full Report (Converted to Slack format)

```python
from scripts.slack_helpers import send_full_report

result = send_full_report(
    report_path=f"reports/{sanitized_name}-{session_id}.md",
    session_id=session_id,
    verdict=verdict,
    score=combined_score
)

print(f"Sent {result['messages_sent']} messages to Slack")
```

The `send_full_report()` function automatically:
1. Reads the markdown report
2. Converts to Slack mrkdwn format (headers, bold, links, tables)
3. Splits into chunks (~3500 chars each)
4. Sends with rate limiting to avoid API errors

#### Environment Variables

The helper script loads credentials automatically from:
1. Environment variables (`SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`, `SLACK_CHANNEL_ID`)
2. Fallback to `.env` file if env vars not set

## Scoring Criteria (v2.0)

### Problem Validation (55% of combined score)
| Criteria | Weight | Scale | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|-------|
| Pain Severity | 20% | 1-10 | How bad is the problem objectively? |
| Startup Addressability | 20% | 1-10 | How viable for a NEW ENTRANT now? (NOT how bad the problem is) |
| Market Size | 20% | 1-10 | Verified SAM — deduct 1pt per derivation layer |
| Willingness to Pay | 20% | 1-10 | CAPPED by evidence tier (Tier 3 max=4) |
| Market Timing | 20% | 1-10 | Is market ready NOW? < 4 = EARLY ELIMINATION |

### Solution Validation (45% of combined score)
| Criteria | Scale | Kill Condition |
|----------|-------|---------------|
| Technical Viability | 1-10 | — |
| Competitive Advantage | 1-10 | **≤ 3 = AUTO-FAIL** |
| Resource Requirements | 1-10 | — |
| Time to Market | 1-10 | — |

### Kill Switch Gates (checked BEFORE scoring)
| Gate | Trigger | Result |
|------|---------|--------|
| Competitor Kill | Funded competitor ($20M+) has exact product | AUTO-FAIL |
| Regulatory Kill | Core feature prohibited or $500K+/12mo+ licensing | AUTO-FAIL |
| Timing Kill | Market <2% penetration, no paying customers today | AUTO-FAIL |

### WTP Evidence Tiers
| Tier | Max WTP Score | Evidence |
|------|---------------|----------|
| Tier 1 | 10 | Signed LOIs, existing payments for identical product |
| Tier 2 | 7 | Validated pricing, competitor revenue for THIS type |
| Tier 3 | 4 | Adjacent category spending only, surveys, projections |

### Smart Mediocrity Check (combined 6.0-6.5)
If combined score is in the marginal zone, count red flags:
- CA ≤ 5, WTP Tier 3 only, Market Timing < 6, Competitor $50M+
- 0-1 flags: PASS sustained | 2 flags: CONDITIONAL | 3+ flags: FAIL

**Passing Threshold**: Combined score >= 6.0/10
**Formula**: `combined = (problem × 55%) + (solution × 45%)`

## Mem0 User ID Scheme

*This section only applies when `MEM0_API_KEY` is configured. Without Mem0, agents return output directly to the orchestrator via Task tool results.*

| Agent | MEM0_USER_ID Pattern |
|-------|---------------------|
| Orchestrator | `ideation_orchestrator_{session_id}` |
| Discovery Engine | `ideation_discovery_engine_{session_id}` |
| Market Researcher | `ideation_market_researcher_{session_id}` |
| Customer Solution | `ideation_customer_solution_{session_id}` |
| Feasibility Scorer | `ideation_feasibility_scorer_{session_id}` |
| Report Pivot | `ideation_report_pivot_{session_id}` |

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `SERPER_API_KEY` | Recommended | For web search (Serper API) |
| `MEM0_API_KEY` | Optional | For Mem0 session persistence |
| `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` | Optional | Slack Bot Token (xoxb-...) for sending reports |
| `SLACK_CHANNEL_ID` | Optional | Channel ID to post reports to |

## Running Without External Integrations

The pipeline works fully without Mem0 or Slack:

### Without Mem0 (`MEM0_API_KEY` not set)
- Agents skip Mem0 writes
- Orchestrator extracts scores from Task tool text output (structured markdown tables)
- `/report {session_id}` only works from saved report files (no Mem0 regeneration)
- No session persistence across separate Claude Code sessions

### Without Slack (`SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` not set)
- Phase 5 is skipped entirely
- Reports are saved to `reports/` directory only
- Use `/report {session_id}` to view saved reports

### Minimum Configuration
| Variable | Required | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| `SERPER_API_KEY` | Recommended | Web search for research quality |

All other variables are optional enhancements.

## Performance Comparison

| Metric | Slack Approach | Native Sub-Agents |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| Cold starts | ~10-15s × 4 agents | 0 |
| API calls | 4+ Slack calls | 0 |
| Polling | Every 10s | Not needed |
| Total overhead | ~60-90s | ~0s |
| **Savings** | - | **~90% faster** |

## Helper Scripts

The `scripts/` directory contains reusable Python helpers:

- `web_research.py` - Web search functions using Serper API
- `mem0_helpers.py` - Streamlined Mem0 operations (used when `MEM0_API_KEY` is set)
- `analysis_tools.py` - TAM/SAM/SOM calculation, scoring, competitive analysis
- `slack_helpers.py` - Slack integration (used when `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` is set):
  - `markdown_to_slack()` - Convert GitHub markdown to Slack mrkdwn
  - `send_full_report()` - Send full report (auto-converts and chunks)
  - `send_evaluation_report()` - Send Block Kit summary
  - `load_slack_credentials()` - Auto-loads from env or .env file

## Example Orchestration

When a user says:
```
Validate: "Legal research is too time-consuming for small law firms"
```

You should:

1. **Generate session_id**: `abc12345`

2. **Detect integrations**: Check env vars, set `use_mem0` and `use_slack`

3. **Initialize Mem0** (if configured): Write session start

4. **Phase 1: PROBLEM VALIDATION** (single message with 2 parallel Tasks):
   - Task: market-researcher → "Analyze market for legal research problem... Mem0 persistence: enabled/disabled" (returns market_timing=7)
   - Task: customer-solution → "Analyze customers for legal research problem... Mem0 persistence: enabled/disabled" (returns WTP tier=2, capped=6)
   - Wait for both to complete
   - Calculate problem_score from 5 criteria = 7.2/10

4. **DECISION**: market_timing (7) >= 4 ✓, problem_score (7.2) >= 6.0 ✓ → Continue to Phase 2

5. **Phase 2: SOLUTION VALIDATION**:
   - Task: feasibility-scorer → Runs kill switch gates first (all clear)→ "Evaluate solution feasibility... Mem0 persistence: enabled/disabled"
   - Calculate solution_score = 7.0/10 (CA=7, no floor hit)
   - combined_score = (7.2 × 0.55) + (7.0 × 0.45) = 7.11/10
   - Verdict: PASS

7. **Phase 3: REPORT**:
   - Task: report-pivot → "Generate final report... Mem0 persistence: enabled/disabled"

8. **Phase 4: SAVE**:
   - Save full report to `reports/legal-research-evaluation-abc12345.md`

9. **Phase 5: NOTIFY** (if Slack configured):
   - Send Block Kit summary to Slack
   - Send full report to Slack (converted to mrkdwn, chunked)

10. **Present summary and file location to user**

**Early Elimination Example** (if problem_score = 3.5):
- Skip Phase 2 entirely
- Go directly to Phase 3 with pivot suggestions
- combined_score = 3.5 × 0.55 = 1.925/10
- Verdict: FAIL

**Kill Switch Example** (Noma has exact product with $100M):
- Phase 2 feasibility-scorer runs kill switch gates FIRST
- Competitor Kill: TRIGGERED (Noma Security, $100M, exact ASPM product)
- Verdict: AUTO-FAIL regardless of any scores
- Report includes pivot suggestions

**Smart Mediocrity Example** (combined = 6.2):
- CA=5, WTP Tier 3, Market Timing=5, Competitor $80M → 4 red flags
- Smart mediocrity check: FAIL — dressed-up 4.0 detected
- Verdict: FAIL despite passing threshold numerically

## Output

At the end of every evaluation, you should:
1. Display a summary table with scores and verdict
2. Provide the file path to the full report
3. List key findings and recommended next steps

Example output:
```
## Evaluation Complete - Session abc12345

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Combined Score | 7.5/10 |
| Verdict | PASS |

Report saved to: reports/legal-research-evaluation-abc12345.md
