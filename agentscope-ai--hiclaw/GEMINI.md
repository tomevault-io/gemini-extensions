# HiClaw Codebase Navigation Guide

This file helps AI Agents (and human developers) quickly understand the project structure and find relevant code.

## What is HiClaw

HiClaw is an open-source Agent Teams system that uses IM (Matrix protocol) for multi-Agent collaboration with human-in-the-loop oversight. It consists of a Manager Agent (coordinator) and Worker Agents (task executors), connected via an AI Gateway (Higress), Matrix Homeserver (Tuwunel), and HTTP File System (MinIO).

## Key Entry Points

### To understand the architecture
- Read [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) for system overview and component diagram
- Read [design/design.md](design/design.md) for full product design (Chinese)
- Read [design/poc-design.md](design/poc-design.md) for detailed implementation specs

### To build and run
- [Makefile](Makefile) -- unified build/test/push/install/replay interface (`make help` for all targets)
- [docs/quickstart.md](docs/quickstart.md) -- end-to-end guide from zero to working team
- [install/hiclaw-install.sh](install/hiclaw-install.sh) -- the installation script
- [scripts/replay-task.sh](scripts/replay-task.sh) -- send tasks to Manager via Matrix CLI

### Local full build (from source)

The image dependency chain is: `openclaw-base` → `manager` / `worker`. CoPaw worker is independent.

By default, `OPENCLAW_BASE_IMAGE` points to the remote registry (`higress-registry.cn-hangzhou.cr.aliyuncs.com/higress/openclaw-base`). When building locally from a modified `openclaw-base`, you **must** override it to the local image name so that manager/worker actually use your local base:

```bash
# Step 1: Build openclaw-base
make build-openclaw-base

# Step 2: Build manager, worker, copaw-worker using the LOCAL base
make build-manager build-worker build-copaw-worker \
    OPENCLAW_BASE_IMAGE=hiclaw/openclaw-base \
    OPENCLAW_BASE_VERSION=latest
```

**Common pitfall**: Running `make build-manager build-worker OPENCLAW_BASE_VERSION=latest` without `OPENCLAW_BASE_IMAGE=hiclaw/openclaw-base` will pull the remote registry's `:latest` tag instead of using the locally-built image. Always set both variables together for local builds.

**Proxy support**: If behind an HTTP proxy, pass proxy build args. This covers APT, PIP, NPM and all other network access — no mirror args needed:
```bash
PROXY_ARGS="--build-arg HTTP_PROXY=http://host.containers.internal:1087 \
    --build-arg HTTPS_PROXY=http://host.containers.internal:1087 \
    --build-arg http_proxy=http://host.containers.internal:1087 \
    --build-arg https_proxy=http://host.containers.internal:1087"

make build-embedded build-manager build-worker build-copaw-worker DOCKER_BUILD_ARGS="${PROXY_ARGS}"
```
Note: use `host.containers.internal` for Podman on macOS, `host.docker.internal` for Docker Desktop.

**China build acceleration (without proxy)**: All Dockerfiles default to official sources. For builds in China without proxy, pass mirror args:
```bash
# APT mirror (for Ubuntu/Debian-based images: openclaw-base, copaw, manager-copaw, embedded)
make build-embedded DOCKER_BUILD_ARGS="--build-arg APT_MIRROR=mirrors.aliyun.com"

# PIP mirror (for Python-based images: copaw, manager-copaw)
make build-copaw-worker DOCKER_BUILD_ARGS="--build-arg APT_MIRROR=mirrors.aliyun.com --build-arg PIP_INDEX_URL=https://mirrors.aliyun.com/pypi/simple/"

# NPM mirror (for Node.js-based images: openclaw-base)
make build-openclaw-base DOCKER_BUILD_ARGS="--build-arg APT_MIRROR=mirrors.aliyun.com --build-arg NPM_REGISTRY=https://registry.npmmirror.com/"
```

## Changelog Policy

Any change that affects the content of a built image — i.e. modifications under `manager/`, `worker/`, `copaw/`, or `openclaw-base/` — **must** be recorded in [`changelog/current.md`](changelog/current.md) before committing.

Format: one bullet per logical change, with a linked commit hash, e.g.:
```
- feat(manager): add task-management skill extracted from AGENTS.md ([a1b2c3d](https://github.com/higress-group/hiclaw/commit/a1b2c3d...))
- fix(manager): fix upgrade-builtins idempotency (duplicate marker insertion) ([e4f5g6h](https://github.com/higress-group/hiclaw/commit/e4f5g6h...))
```

On release, the workflow automatically renames `current.md` → `vX.Y.Z.md` and creates a fresh `current.md`.

## Key Design Patterns

1. **All communication in Matrix Rooms**: Human + Manager + Worker are all in the same Room. Human sees everything, can intervene anytime.
2. **Centralized file system**: All Agent configs and state stored in MinIO. Workers are stateless -- destroy and recreate freely.
3. **Unified credential management**: Worker uses one Consumer key-auth token for both LLM and MCP Server access. Manager controls permissions.
4. **Skills as documentation**: Each SKILL.md is a self-contained reference that tells the Agent how to use an API or tool.

## Agent-Facing Content: Writing Convention

Files under `manager/agent/` are **read by the Agent at runtime**, not by human developers. All content in these paths must be written from the Agent's own perspective using second-person voice ("you"):

- **AGENTS.md, SOUL.md, HEARTBEAT.md** — address the Agent directly: "You are the Manager...", "Your responsibilities include..."
- **SKILL.md** — instruct the Agent as the reader: "Use this script to...", "You can call...", "Run `mcporter --config ~/mcporter-servers.json list` to see..."
- **TOOLS.md** — describe tools available to the Agent: "You have access to...", "Use `mc cp` to push..."
- **Script `log` output and comments** — write from the system's perspective, but keep the Agent as the implied operator. Avoid third-person references like "the Manager does X" — instead say "Step 4: Updating your mcporter-servers.json..."

**Do NOT** use third-person descriptions like "Manager can call..." or "This skill provides..." in agent-facing files. The Agent is the reader — talk to it directly.

This convention applies to all files that end up in the Agent's workspace or are loaded as skills/prompts at runtime:
- `manager/agent/**` (Manager Agent config, skills, tools)
- `manager/agent/worker-agent/**` (OpenClaw Worker Agent config, builtin skills)
- `manager/agent/copaw-worker-agent/**` (CoPaw Worker Agent config, builtin skills)
- `manager/agent/worker-skills/**` (on-demand skill definitions pushed to Workers)

## Environment Variables

See [manager/scripts/init/start-manager-agent.sh](manager/scripts/init/start-manager-agent.sh) for the full list of `HICLAW_*` environment variables used by the Manager container.

## Verified Technical Details

All technical assumptions have been verified in POC. See [design/poc-tech-verification.md](design/poc-tech-verification.md) for detailed verification results. Key findings that affect implementation:

- Tuwunel uses `CONDUWUIT_` env prefix (not `TUWUNEL_`)
- Higress Console uses Session Cookie auth (not Basic Auth)
- MCP Server created via `PUT` (not `POST`)
- Auth plugin takes ~40s to activate after first configuration
- OpenClaw Skills auto-load from `workspace/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
