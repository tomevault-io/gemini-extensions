# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to coding agents (Claude Code, etc.) when working
with code in this repository.

## Common Commands

The package manager is **yarn** — every script in `package.json` and every CI
workflow uses it.

- `yarn test` — run the full test suite (vitest, see `vitest.config.ts`).
- `yarn test src/lib/__tests__/commit-message.test.ts` — run a single test file.
- `yarn test -t "<name pattern>"` — run a single test case by name.
- `yarn test:e2e` — end-to-end test: build the bundle, launch VS Code in a temp
  git repo, drive the conventional-commits flow non-interactively, assert a real
  commit landed. Sources live under `e2e-test/`. The first run downloads a VS
  Code build into `.vscode-test/` (network access required).
- `yarn watch` — `tsc -watch` for incremental type-checking during development.
- `yarn webpack` — bundle the extension to `dist/extension.js` in development
  mode.
- `yarn webpack-dev` — same as `yarn webpack` but with `--watch`.
- `yarn build` — runs `node prepare.js` then `vsce package --yarn`. **Side
  effect:** `prepare.js` downloads the upstream `gitmojis.json` from GitHub into
  `src/vendors/gitmojis.json`, so the first build needs network access.
- `yarn deploy` — `vsce publish --yarn` (Marketplace publish).

### Launching the extension host (manual testing)

Use VS Code's **Run Extension** launch task. Per the README's Contribution note:

1. Install the
   [`vscode-tsl-problem-matcher`](https://github.com/eamodio/vscode-tsl-problem-matcher)
   VS Code extension once — the task depends on it.
2. After editing source, **restart the task** (kill and relaunch) so the rebuilt
   bundle is picked up. A simple reload of the host window is not enough.

## Repo Conventions

- Husky hooks live in `.husky/`:
  - `pre-commit` runs `yarn lint-staged` (prettier on staged files matching
    `*.{js,ts,css,less,json,md,html,yml,yaml,pcss,jsx,tsx}`).
  - `commit-msg` runs `yarn commitlint --edit $1` against the conventional
    config (`@commitlint/config-conventional`).
- Releases are driven by edits to `CHANGELOG.md` on `master`; do not hand-bump
  `package.json` independently of the release flow.
- Tests live in `src/**/__tests__/**/*.test.ts` (vitest config restricts the
  glob to that path).

## Architecture

### Activation flow

`src/extension.ts` is the entry point declared by `package.json`'s `main`
(`./dist/extension.js`, produced by webpack). On `activate`:

1. Initialize logging (`src/lib/output.ts`) and localization
   (`src/lib/localize.ts`).
2. Register three commands. The main one (`extension.conventionalCommits`) wires
   `createConventionalCommits` from `src/lib/conventional-commits.ts`.
3. Register a `commit-message:` virtual filesystem provider (see Editor /
   virtual-FS below).

`createConventionalCommits` (in `src/lib/conventional-commits.ts`) is the
runtime workflow:

1. Locate the VS Code Git API and pick a repository (`getRepository` — handles
   single repo, multi-repo quick-pick, and explicit URI argument from the SCM
   menu).
2. `commitlint.loadRuleConfigs(repository.rootUri.fsPath)` — load rules + prompt
   config (see Commitlint below).
3. `prompts({...})` — drive the prompt step machine to collect a `CommitMessage`
   (see Prompt machine below).
4. `serialize(commitMessage)` from `src/lib/commit-message.ts` — turn the
   structured message into a single git commit string
   (`type(scope): gitmoji subject [skip ci]\n\nbody\n\nfooter`).
5. Write to `repository.inputBox.value`. Either auto-commit via `git.commit`, or
   hand off to the editor virtual-FS when `showEditor` is enabled.

### Prompt step machine

`src/lib/prompts.ts` builds an ordered list of `Prompt` questions (`type`,
`scope`, `gitmoji`, `ci`, `subject`, `body`, `footer`), filters by user
configuration (e.g. `promptScopes`, `gitmoji`, `showEditor` hides body/footer
because the editor handles them), and walks them with an index-based loop that
supports a Back button:

- Each step dispatches to one of three handlers in
  `src/lib/prompts/prompt-types.ts`: `QUICK_PICK` (selectable items, optional
  `noneItem`), `INPUT_BOX` (free text + `validate`), and
  `CONFIGURABLE_QUICK_PICK` (quick-pick over a workspace/global setting list
  with new-item input — used for scopes).
- A previous-step's `PromptStatus` (its `value` and `activeItems`) is preserved
  so the Back button (`QuickInputButtons.Back`) can restore it. The handlers
  throw a `{ button, value }` object when Back is pressed; the loop catches it,
  decrements `index`, and replays the prior step seeded with its previous
  answer.
- After the loop, results are folded into a `CommitMessage`
  (`src/lib/commit-message.ts`) with optional per-field `format` (e.g.
  line-break substitution).

### Commitlint integration

`src/lib/commitlint.ts` exposes a singleton `commitlint`. Key responsibilities:

- `loadRuleConfigs(cwd)` calls `@commitlint/load`'s `load({}, { cwd })` to read
  the project's commitlint config (rules + optional `prompt` metadata used to
  drive UI titles/descriptions).
- `getTypeEnum()` / `getScopeEnum()` extract enum values from the `type-enum` /
  `scope-enum` rules so the prompts can offer them as picker items.
- `lintType` / `lintScope` / `lintSubject` / `lintHeader` / `lintBody` /
  `lintFooter` run `@commitlint/rules` against a partial `Commit` and return an
  error string (or `''`). The prompt `validate` callbacks call these to surface
  inline errors.

### Localization

- Static (`package.json`) UI strings use VS Code's NLS `%key%` placeholder
  format and are resolved from `package.nls.json` (default) plus locale-specific
  siblings such as `package.nls.zh-cn.json`, `package.nls.tr.json`, etc.
- Runtime strings use `src/lib/localize.ts`. `initialize()` reads
  `vscode.env.language`, loads `package.nls.json` and
  `package.nls.<locale>.json` from the extension root, and `localize(key)` /
  `getPromptLocalize(key)` / `getSourcesLocalize(key)` look up keys with English
  fallback.

### Editor / virtual-FS mode

When `conventionalCommits.showEditor` is `true`, `src/lib/editor/index.ts`'s
`openMessageInTab(repository)` opens a URI of the form
`commit-message:/COMMIT_EDITMSG` and lets the user finish the body/footer in a
real text editor. The `commit-message:` scheme is implemented by
`src/lib/editor/provider.ts` (a custom `vscode.FileSystemProvider`):

- `readFile` returns `repository.inputBox.value` as bytes.
- `writeFile` decodes the buffer back into `repository.inputBox.value` and,
  depending on `editor.keepAfterSave` / `autoCommit`, either closes the tab and
  runs `git.commit`, or leaves it open.
- `watch`'s disposable handles the case where the user closes the tab without
  saving.

Provider registration happens once during `activate` in `src/extension.ts`.

### Why `webpack.config.js` uses `string-replace-loader`

`@commitlint/load` (and its dependencies `@commitlint/resolve-extends`,
`import-fresh`, `resolve-global`) load user-authored commitlint configs at
runtime via dynamic `require(...)` / `require.resolve(...)` calls. Webpack's
static analysis would either bundle those targets at build time (wrong — the
path is unknown until the user installs the extension and points it at their
workspace) or fail because the path is non-literal.

The fix in `webpack.config.js` is five `string-replace-loader` rules
(`enforce: 'pre'`) that rewrite each occurrence of `require` to
`__non_webpack_require__` (and `require.resolve` to
`__non_webpack_require__.resolve`) inside the relevant files under
`node_modules/@commitlint/load/lib/`,
`node_modules/@commitlint/resolve-extends/lib/`, `node_modules/import-fresh/`,
and `node_modules/resolve-global/`. `__non_webpack_require__` is webpack's
escape hatch that emits a real Node `require` in the bundle, so the dynamic
resolution happens against the user's actual `node_modules` at runtime. If a
future commitlint upgrade changes one of the patched lines, the `strict: true`
option will fail the build until the search/replace is updated.

### File map (quick reference)

- `src/extension.ts` — activation entrypoint, command + provider registration.
- `src/lib/conventional-commits.ts` — main workflow
  (`createConventionalCommits`).
- `src/lib/prompts.ts` — prompt orchestration + Back-button history.
- `src/lib/prompts/prompt-types.ts` — `QUICK_PICK` / `INPUT_BOX` /
  `CONFIGURABLE_QUICK_PICK` handlers.
- `src/lib/commitlint.ts` — `@commitlint/load` integration, lint helpers, enum
  extraction.
- `src/lib/commit-message.ts` — `CommitMessage` model + `serialize` /
  `serializeHeader` / `serializeSubject`.
- `src/lib/editor/` — `commit-message:` virtual filesystem (`provider.ts`) and
  tab-open helper (`index.ts`).
- `src/lib/localize.ts` — runtime locale lookup.
- `package.nls*.json` — VS Code NLS bundles for static manifest strings.
- `webpack.config.js` — bundler config and the commitlint dynamic-`require`
  patches.
- `prepare.js` — pre-build step that downloads `src/vendors/gitmojis.json`.
