# Etch Language Implementation

## Directives
- **Never change directory with `cd` when executing commands, stay in the project root (where this file lives)**
- **Never commit or stash code using git, use it only to inspect previous commits or changed files only**
- **Never ever think about giving up, like "we should do Y but because it's too much, for now we do X" and you end up shortcutting to tech debt and fake implementations**
- **When you create new tests in examples (both passing and failing) add the corresponding validation files .pass and .fail**
- **Everytime you are modifying the bytecode or AST structure, bump their corresponding version numbers but keep supporting only the latest version in code**
- **Never disable features if you cannot make them work, instead restart from a smaller problem and iterate in steps until you can understand the issue deeply**
- **Make all examples grouped by the first word, for example if you are testing a specific feature (like `comptime` or `inference`), use it as first part of the example name like `comptime_inject_test.etch`**
- **When hunting bugs or making changes, add extensive verbose logging protected by the verbose flag, this will help you detect issues**
- **Never swallow nim exceptions, print the exception for debugging purposes**
- **Keep updated the documentation in @docs/ (and the developers docs in @docs/internal/) as we keep iterating changes**
- **Remember `result` is a valid keyword in nim, so don't create variables with that name if it's not the implicit one**
- **Try to not add too many comments in methods, try to keep it just for method signature, not several inside bodies at every instruction**
- **Never try to write files into /tmp**
- **Never execute binaries from ~/.cache/nim**
- **Don't waste time with `nimpretty`**

## Testing and validation of correctness

For bugfixing and validation, you have to:
- **Compile and run a single etch file in verbose mode with**:
  - `just go-quiet examples/simple_test.etch` and `just go-quiet examples/simple_test.etch --release` to just test output
  - `just go-compiler examples/simple_test.etch` and `just go-compiler examples/simple_test.etch --release` to print the compiler verbose output
  - `just go-verbose examples/simple_test.etch` and `just go-verbose examples/simple_test.etch --release` to print the full verbose output (compiler + vm)
- **Validate a test case by compiling and running a single example** `just test examples/simple_test.etch`:
    * If the test is passing, you need to provide a `examples/simple_test.pass` file
    * Otherwise a `examples/simple_test.fail` one when it fails.
- **Primary validation testing workflow**: test compiling and running examples + debugger tests with `just tests` and `just tests-c` for C backend tests.
- To test **only** the debugger integration, use `just tests-debugger`.
- Compile and reinstall the VSCode extension with `just vscode`

## Improvement plan

1. Expand immediate & fused forms
In regvm_compiler.nim, emit op*I, op*Int/Float, and comparison+jump opcodes whenever prover/lifetime metadata proves operand types. Mirror Lua’s docondjump by folding the branch into the test instruction (opCmpJmp) so the interpreter executes one dispatch instead of two.

2. Table/array fast paths
Implement helpers akin to luaV_fastget/luaV_fastset in exec_instructions/objects.nim that assume constant short-string keys (opGetField, opSetField) and only fall back to the slow path/metamethod code when a tagged miss occurs. Likewise add specialized opGetI, opSetI variants that bypass hash lookups entirely.

3. Optimizer + prover integration
Wire expression_analysis.nim results into optimizeConstantFolding and a fixed optimizeDeadCode pass so redundant refcount instructions and type guards disappear before emission. Follow AGENTS.md Phase 1 by stripping bounds/division checks the prover proves safe and by resurrecting peephole fusion (Phase 3) to shrink instruction count.

4. Reference-count pressure relief
Extend regvm_lifetime data so optimizeRefCounting can drop adjacent opIncRef/opDecRef pairs and hoist opCheckCycles out of inner loops. Long term, treat heap objects like Lua tables: embed mutability bits and emit barriers only when a write crosses generations.


Etch Language/Compiler/Prover/Interpreter Improvement Plan
Based on the comprehensive VM architecture analysis document, here's a prioritized plan to improve Etch:

Phase 1: Bytecode Optimization Infrastructure (HIGH PRIORITY)

1.1 Integrate Prover Information into Optimizer

Files: src/etch/bytecode/compiler.nim, src/etch/bytecode/prover/expression_analysis.nim
- Use range analysis results from the prover to eliminate runtime checks
- Add dead code elimination based on evaluateCondition() results
- Remove bounds checks when prover proves safety
- Remove division-by-zero checks when prover proves divisor is non-zero
- Impact: Major performance boost, cleaner bytecode

Phase 2: Instruction Set Improvements (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

2.1 Add Jump Target Table

File: src/etch/core/vm.nim
- Create explicit jump target table for each function
- Validate jumps only go to valid targets
- Enable "switch out data tables" optimization mentioned in the document
- Impact: Safer bytecode, enables advanced optimizations

2.2 Add Reversed Arithmetic Operations

File: src/etch/core/vm.nim
- Add opRSub, opRDiv, opRMod for when operands are swapped
- Update compiler to use these when beneficial
- Impact: Slightly better code generation in some cases

Phase 3: Advanced Optimizations (MEDIUM-HIGH PRIORITY)

3.1 Peephole Optimization Passes

File: src/etch/bytecode/compiler.nim
- Pattern: LoadK + LoadK + Arithmetic → single LoadK with folded result
- Pattern: Test + Jmp → TestJmp (fused instruction - already exists!)
- Pattern: Jmp to Jmp → Jmp to target
- Pattern: Move + Move → single Move
- Impact: Faster execution, smaller bytecode

3.2 Common Subexpression Elimination (CSE)

File: src/etch/bytecode/compiler.nim
- Fix and enhance existing CSE implementation
- Track expressions across basic blocks
- Invalidate cache on control flow merge
- Impact: Fewer redundant computations

3.3 Dead Store Elimination

File: src/etch/bytecode/compiler.nim
- Use lifetime.nim data to eliminate stores to dead registers
- Currently broken, generates wrong bytecode
- Remove writes that are never read
- Impact: Smaller bytecode, faster execution

3.4 Loop Optimizations

File: src/etch/bytecode/compiler.nim
- Strength reduction (replace expensive ops with cheaper ones)
- Induction variable elimination
- Impact: Significantly faster loops

Phase 4: Type-Aware Optimizations (HIGH IMPACT)

4.1 Static Type Specialization

Files: src/etch/core/vm.nim, src/etch/core/vm_execution.nim
- Add type-specialized instruction variants (e.g., opAddInt, opAddFloat)
- Generate specialized code when types are statically known
- Eliminate runtime type checks from templates like doAdd, doSub, etc.
- Impact: Major performance improvement (20-40% faster arithmetic)

4.2 Monomorphization for Generic Code

File: src/etch/bytecode/typechecker/types.nim
- Generate specialized versions of generic functions
- Eliminates dynamic dispatch where possible
- Impact: Better optimization opportunities

Phase 6: Instruction Fusion (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

6.1 Expand Fused Operations

Files: src/etch/core/vm.nim, src/etch/bytecode/compiler.nim
- Current fusions: AddAdd, MulAdd, CmpJmp, IncTest, LoadAddStore, GetAddSet
- Add more patterns:
  - Load + Test + Jump → LoadTestJump
  - Compare + Store → already have EqStore, LtStore, etc. - good!
  - Load + Cast → LoadCast
  - Array operations: GetIndex + Arithmetic + SetIndex
- Impact: Fewer instructions, faster execution

6.2 Pattern-Based Fusion Framework

File: src/etch/bytecode/compiler.nim
- Create declarative pattern matching system
- Make it easy to add new fusion patterns
- Impact: Extensible optimization framework

Phase 7: Immediate Variants (LOW PRIORITY)

7.1 More Immediate Instructions

File: src/etch/core/vm.nim
- Already have: AddI, SubI, MulI, EqI, LtI, LeI
- Add: DivI, ModI, AndI, OrI, GetIndexI (already exists!)
- Impact: Smaller bytecode for common patterns

Phase 8: Debugging and Tooling (ONGOING)

8.1 Bytecode Verifier

New file: src/etch/capabilities/verifier.nim
- Verify bytecode before execution
- Check jump targets are valid
- Verify register usage doesn't exceed limits
- Validate instruction operands
- Impact: Catch compiler bugs, safer execution

8.2 Better Bytecode Dumper

File: src/etch/capabilities/dumper.nim

8.3 Optimization Statistics

New feature: Add --optimization-report flag
- Show which optimizations were applied
- Show bytecode size before/after
- Show estimated performance improvement
- Impact: Better understanding of optimization effectiveness

Testing Strategy

- Run `just tests` after each change
- Use `just perf` to benchmark improvements
- Create regression tests for each optimization
- Ensure prover still catches all safety violations
