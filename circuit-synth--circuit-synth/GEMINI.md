# CLAUDE.md - circuit-synth Library Development Guide

This guide defines how Claude Code assists with developing the circuit-synth Python library.

## Project Context

- **Test-first mentality** - never commit untested code
- **Log-driven investigation** - observe behavior, don't assume
- **Small batch releases** - frequent, incremental PyPI releases
- **Professional quality** - 80%+ test coverage, type hints, CI/CD enforcement

---

## Professional Quality Standards

All work must meet professional software engineering standards:

- **Testing**: 80%+ coverage (enforced in settings), test-first development
- **Type Safety**: Type hints required for all functions
- **Code Quality**: black, isort, ruff (automated linting)
- **Security**: bandit, safety (automated scanning)
- **CI/CD**: Automated enforcement on every PR
- **Documentation**: Complete docstrings for all public APIs
- **Writing**: Technical claims only (no marketing language)

See [PROFESSIONAL_QUALITY_STANDARDS.md](https://github.com/circuit-synth/claude-files-inventory/blob/main/PROFESSIONAL_QUALITY_STANDARDS.md) and [SHARED_WRITING_STANDARDS.md](https://github.com/circuit-synth/claude-files-inventory/blob/main/SHARED_WRITING_STANDARDS.md) for complete requirements.

## 🎯 Core Development Philosophy

### 1. GitHub Issue-Driven Development

All work starts with a GitHub issue:

1. **Create/select issue** - Check existing issues or create new one
2. **Break down** - Issue describes the goal; we break into small subtasks
3. **Work on subtask** - One focused task at a time
4. **Reference in commits** - `fix: Correct Text class parameters (#238)`
5. **Close with verification** - Issue closes when task is done and tested

**Why:** Keeps work visible, context survives across sessions, enables focused problem-solving.

### 2. Test-First Mentality (MANDATORY)

Never commit untested code.

```python
# Pattern for every task:

# Step 1: Write failing test
def test_potentiometer_component():
    pot = Potentiometer("R1", value="10k")
    assert pot.reference == "R1"
    assert pot.footprint  # Should auto-select

# Step 2: Implement minimal code to pass test
class Potentiometer(Component):
    def __init__(self, reference, value):
        super().__init__(reference)
        self.value = value
        self._select_footprint()

# Step 3: Run test - verify it passes
# Step 4: Add regression tests for edge cases
# Step 5: Verify test coverage >80%
```

**Why:** Test documents expected behavior, provides safety net for changes, catches regressions.

### 3. Iterative Cycle Pattern (CORE)

**Do NOT write large amounts of code, then test once.**
**DO work in tight iterative cycles: Add Logs → Run → Observe → Repeat**

```
Cycle: Add Logs → Run → Observe → Repeat
Target: 10-20 cycles per task, each 2-3 minutes
Result: Deep understanding + confident implementation
```

#### The Cycle Process:

1. **Add strategic logging** to code area you're studying
2. **Run the code/test** immediately
3. **Observe log output** to understand behavior
4. **Refine understanding** based on what logs revealed
5. **Make small change** (1-5 lines) based on observation
6. **Run again immediately** - repeat cycle

#### Example: 8-Cycle Bug Investigation

```
Issue #238: Text class parameters incorrect

Cycle 1: Add logs to see what's being called
  ↓ Run test, observe logs
  ↓ Logs show: Text(position, text) is being called

Cycle 2: Add logs to constructor
  ↓ Run test, observe
  ↓ Logs show: Parameters received in wrong order

Cycle 3: Check Text.__init__ signature
  ↓ Run code
  ↓ Logs show: Signature expects (text, at=position) but caller uses (position, text)

Cycle 4: Find all callers of Text
  ↓ Run grep
  ↓ Found: 3 places calling with wrong parameter order

Cycle 5: Write test with correct parameter order
  ↓ Run test - FAILS (parameters still swapped)

Cycle 6: Fix first caller
  ↓ Run test - PASSES
  ↓ Logs show: Parameters now in correct order

Cycle 7: Fix remaining callers
  ↓ Run all tests - PASS
  ↓ All logs show correct order

Cycle 8: Clean up debug logs, verify production logs
  ↓ Remove 🔍 temporary logs
  ↓ Run test - still passing, output clean
```

**Total time:** ~30 minutes in 8 tight cycles.

## 🔬 Log-Driven Investigation

Logs are your development tool. Use them to understand behavior, not to guess.

### Strategic Logging Pattern

Follow standard Python logging best practices. **No emojis in logs.**

```python
# Temporary investigation logs (remove after understanding)
logger.debug(f"CYCLE {n}: Investigating {variable_name} = {value}")
logger.debug(f"CYCLE {n}: Function entry with args: {args}")
logger.debug(f"CYCLE {n}: Branch taken: {branch_info}")

# Permanent operational logs (keep)
# These provide production insight and debugging capability
logger.info(f"Generated netlist for {circuit.name}")
logger.debug(f"Selected footprint {footprint} for {component.reference}")
logger.warning(f"Component {ref} missing footprint, using default")
logger.error(f"Failed to validate {ref}: {error}")
```

**Log Levels:**
- **DEBUG:** Development insights, detailed state inspection
- **INFO:** Important state transitions, user-visible operations
- **WARNING:** Recoverable issues, deprecated API usage
- **ERROR:** Failures, exceptions that need attention

**Professional, parseable output only.**

### Context Window Management

Disable verbose logs from other modules while investigating:

```python
import logging

# Silence noisy libraries
logging.getLogger('urllib3').setLevel(logging.ERROR)
logging.getLogger('kicad').setLevel(logging.WARNING)
logging.getLogger('circuit_synth.netlist').setLevel(logging.WARNING)

# Enable DEBUG for area under study
logging.getLogger('circuit_synth.components').setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
logger = logging.getLogger('circuit_synth.components')
```

### Log Categories

**Temporary Investigation Logs (Remove After Understanding)**
- Variable state inspection: `logger.debug(f"CYCLE {n}: {var} = {value}")`
- Control flow tracing: `logger.debug(f"CYCLE {n}: Entering function {func_name}")`
- Data structure dumps: `logger.debug(f"CYCLE {n}: Dict keys: {dict.keys()}")`
- "Why is this happening?" logs
- Hypothesis testing logs

**Permanent Operational Logs (Keep)**
- Important state transitions: `logger.info(f"Created circuit {name}")`
- User-visible operations: `logger.info(f"Generated {num_nets} nets")`
- Error conditions: `logger.error(f"Failed to validate {ref}: {error}")`
- Warnings: `logger.warning(f"Deprecated API usage: {old_api}")`
- Performance metrics: `logger.debug(f"Netlist generation took {ms}ms")`

**No emojis, symbols, or decorative characters in logs. Professional output only.**

### Claude's Behavior During Cycles

When investigating or developing:

1. **Add strategic logs** - Mark with "CYCLE N:" prefix for easy cleanup
2. **Run immediately** - Don't wait, test right away
3. **Report observations** - Share what logs showed
4. **Propose hypothesis** - What does this tell us?
5. **Plan next cycle** - What will we try next and why?
6. **Disable noise** - Turn off unrelated logs to save context
7. **Keep iterating** - Each cycle informs the next

Example cycle report:
```
Cycle 3 complete:
Logs showed component.pins is empty list.
Hypothesis: pins aren't being loaded from component library.
Next cycle: Add logs to library loading function.
```

**Track cycle metrics:** Time per cycle, observations, hypotheses tested.

## 📦 Small Batch Workflow

Work in small, independently releasable chunks.

### Typical Small Batch (15-30 minutes)

1. **Read/create GitHub issue** describing the work (2 min)
2. **Write failing test** capturing desired behavior (3 min)
3. **Implement with cycles** - investigate, understand, code (10-15 cycles, ~15 min)
4. **Verify test passes** - all tests green (2 min)
5. **Clean up logs** - remove 🔍 temporary logs (1 min)
6. **Commit with issue reference** - `fix: Short description (#123)` (1 min)
7. **Release to PyPI** - patch version bump if stable (2 min)
8. **Verify installation** - fresh venv install test (2 min)

### Example: Adding Potentiometer Component (30 min)

```
Issue #245: Add Potentiometer component support

Setup (5 min, 3 cycles):
  Cycle 1: Add logs to existing Resistor class to understand pattern
    ↓ Run, observe: component creation and footprint selection
  Cycle 2: Add logs to footprint selection logic
    ↓ Run, observe: footprint selection based on value
  Cycle 3: Study existing component implementations
    ↓ Run grep, observe: clear pattern for component classes

Test (5 min, 1 cycle):
  Cycle 4: Write failing test for Potentiometer
    ↓ Run test, observe: AttributeError: Potentiometer not defined
    ↓ Good - test is ready

Implementation (15 min, 5 cycles):
  Cycle 5: Create Potentiometer class skeleton with logs
    ↓ Run test, observe: footprint attribute missing
  Cycle 6: Add __init__ and footprint selection with logs
    ↓ Run test, observe: footprint selected correctly
  Cycle 7: Verify netlist generation with logs
    ↓ Run test, observe: netlist generated correctly
  Cycle 8: Test edge cases with logs
    ↓ Run test, observe: all edge cases pass
  Cycle 9: Remove 🔍 logs, keep essential ones
    ↓ Run test, observe: still passing, output clean

Cleanup & Release (5 min):
  Commit: "feat: Add Potentiometer component support (#245)"
  PyPI: Release as patch (0.2.3 → 0.2.4)
  Verify: Fresh install test in new venv

Total: 13 cycles in ~30 minutes (2.3 min per cycle)
```

### Breaking Down Larger Issues

If an issue is too big for 30 minutes:
1. **Create subtask issues** with smaller scope
2. **Work on one subtask per session** (15-30 min)
3. **Each subtask is independently releasable**
4. **Reference parent issue** in subtask (e.g., "Part of #240")
5. **Close parent issue** only when all subtasks done

---

## 🤝 Operating Modes

Claude can work collaboratively or autonomously depending on task clarity.

### Collaborative Mode (Default for Unclear Tasks)

When requirements are ambiguous or need validation:
- **Discuss approach** - Ask questions, explore options
- **Validate assumptions** - Confirm understanding
- **Break down together** - Plan small tasks
- **Create issues together** - Structure the work

**Trigger:** "I'm not sure how to approach this" or complex requirements

### Autonomous Mode (For Clear Tasks)

When requirements are well-defined and clear:
- **Create GitHub issues** - Reference what will be done
- **Implement independently** - Use cycles and logs
- **Run full verification** - Tests, quality checks, formatting
- **Propose commits** - Self-validate before asking
- **Continue momentum** - Don't wait between cycles

**Trigger:** Clear GitHub issue exists, or simple bug fix with obvious solution

### Hybrid Mode (Complex Features)

Balance of both approaches:
- **Discuss architecture** - Collaborative design phase
- **Create task breakdown** - Small subtasks emerge
- **Autonomous implementation** - Of individual subtasks
- **Continuous verification** - Parallel review threads
- **Checkpoint discussions** - At subtask boundaries

**Trigger:** Large feature with design decisions and implementation phases

---

## ⚡ Multi-Threaded Development

Always try to parallelize work. Use Haiku 4.5 extensively for fast parallel execution.

### Parallel Execution Pattern

When you're working on feature X:

```
Main thread (You): Implement feature
  ↓

Parallel threads (Haiku sub-agents):
  Thread A: Run test suite, report failures
  Thread B: Check code quality (black, mypy, flake8)
  Thread C: Security scan for obvious issues
  Thread D: Verify documentation accuracy
  Thread E: Check example circuits still work
```

**Key:** Launch all parallel threads in ONE message. Don't wait sequentially.

### Before Every Commit

Launch verification suite:
1. **Test execution** - Full test suite with coverage
2. **Type checking** - mypy verification
3. **Formatting** - Black, isort formatting
4. **Linting** - flake8 code quality
5. **Security scan** - Basic security checks
6. **Documentation** - README/docs accuracy check
7. **Example circuits** - All examples generate without error

### After Every PyPI Release

Launch post-release verification:
1. **Fresh install test** - New venv, `pip install circuit-synth`
2. **Example circuit** - Run a basic example
3. **Import test** - Verify all imports work
4. **Version check** - PyPI shows correct version
5. **Plugin test** - KiCad integration still works

```

### Dependency Libraries (We Maintain These!)

**CRITICAL:** We maintain the lower-level KiCad libraries that circuit-synth depends on:

- **kicad-sch-api** - KiCad schematic file API
  - Repository: https://github.com/circuit-synth/kicad-sch-api
  - Purpose: Read/write KiCad .kicad_sch files
  - Used by: circuit-synth for schematic generation


**Decision Rule:** When debugging issues in circuit-synth:

1. **Root cause in circuit-synth** → Fix it here
2. **Root cause in kicad-sch-api** → Fix it there

**Why this matters:**
- Don't work around upstream bugs - fix them at the source
- Improvements benefit all users of these libraries
- Better architectural separation
- Easier to maintain long-term

**Workflow for upstream fixes:**

1. **Identify root cause** - Is the bug in circuit-synth or the API library?
2. **If in API library:**
   ```bash
   # Create GitHub issue in library repo
   gh issue create --repo circuit-synth/kicad-sch-api \
     --title "Bug: Position.to_dict() missing angle field" \
     --body "Root cause analysis...

   Minimal reproduction:
   \`\`\`python
   pos = Position(x=10, y=20, angle=45)
   result = pos.to_dict()
   # Expected: {'x': 10, 'y': 20, 'angle': 45}
   # Actual: {'x': 10, 'y': 20}  # Missing 'angle'
   \`\`\`

   Impact: circuit-synth issue #XXX blocked
   "

   # Clone and fix in that repo
   git clone https://github.com/circuit-synth/kicad-sch-api.git
   cd kicad-sch-api

   # Create branch and fix with test-first approach
   git checkout -b fix/position-angle-serialization
   # ... write test, implement fix, verify

   # Create PR in upstream repo
   gh pr create --fill

   # After merge: Release new version to PyPI
   # (Maintainer will handle this)

   # Update circuit-synth dependency
   cd ../circuit-synth
   # In pyproject.toml: kicad-sch-api>=1.2.3
   poetry update kicad-sch-api

   # Verify fix works in circuit-synth
   pytest tests/test_that_was_blocked.py
   ```

3. **If in circuit-synth:**
   - Fix it here as normal


**Example scenario:**

```
Issue: "Component positions not serializing correctly"

Investigation reveals:
- circuit-synth calls kicad-sch-api's Position.to_dict()
- Position.to_dict() has a bug (missing 'angle' field)

Correct approach:
1. Fix Position.to_dict() in kicad-sch-api
2. Add test in kicad-sch-api
3. Release kicad-sch-api v1.2.3
4. Update circuit-synth: kicad-sch-api>=1.2.3
5. Verify fix works in circuit-synth

Wrong approach:
- Work around it in circuit-synth with custom serialization
```

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit tests** - For individual functions/classes
- **Integration tests** - For component interaction
- **Example tests** - Verify example circuits generate and validate
- **Regression tests** - Prevent re-breaking fixed issues
- **Target coverage** - >80% for new code, >85% overall

### Test-First Pattern

All development follows test-first:
1. Write failing test
2. Implement minimal code to pass
3. Add regression tests
4. Verify coverage >80%
5. Commit with test evidence

### Release Process

1. **Work on feature/fix** - Small batch, test-first
2. **Verify test suite** - All tests passing
3. **Version bump** - patch/minor/major as appropriate
4. **Release to PyPI** - `poetry publish`
5. **Verify installation** - Fresh venv test
6. **Create next issue** - Plan next small batch

### Regression Test Suite

Run full test suite before every release:

```bash
./tools/testing/run_full_regression_tests.py
```

Should show:
- All tests passing
- No regressions
- Coverage >85%
- No performance degradation
