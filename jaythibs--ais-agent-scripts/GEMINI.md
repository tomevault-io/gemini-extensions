```

**IMPORTANT**: When creating markdown files or documentation, always place them in the appropriate `docs/` subdirectory rather than the project root. Use:
- `docs/guides/` for tutorials and how-to documentation
- `docs/reference/` for API references and technical specifications
- `docs/templates/` for reusable document templates
- `docs/` root only for high-level planning documents
</directory_structure>

## Workflow Guidelines

<research_workflow>
1. **Requirement Formalization**
   - Create unambiguous requirements in `issues/`
   - Include testable acceptance criteria
   - Specify edge cases and failure modes
   - **Meta-prompting**: If requirements are unclear, ask for more specification

2. **Planning Phase**
   - Document approach in `docs/plan_<issue_no>.md`
   - Identify potential risks and mitigations
   - Define checkpoints and validation methods
   - Consider that most intuitively plausible techniques don't work
   - Plan for multiple iterations - good ideas often take many tries

3. **Implementation**
   - Work incrementally with continuous testing
   - Maintain clean git history with atomic commits
   - Document decisions and trade-offs inline
   - **Optimize feedback loops**: Rapid feedback is crucial for progress
   - Consider hardware efficiency - avoid obviously inefficient code

4. **Documentation**
   - Update findings in real-time
   - Include both successes and failures
   - Cross-reference related work
   - Document what didn't work and why - this prevents repeated mistakes

5. **Validation**
   - Run comprehensive test suites
   - Perform multi-agent verification for critical components
   - Document performance characteristics
   - **Always use strong baselines** - most techniques only look good with weak baselines
   - Expect that much work won't impact the final result - this is normal
</research_workflow>

## Code Quality Standards

<code_quality>
### Implementation Guidelines
1. **No Mock Data - CRITICAL**: Never create mock data, placeholder functions, mock API calls, or fake unit tests
   - Always implement real functionality with actual logic
   - Use actual data from files or generate realistic test data
   - Avoid TODO placeholders in production code
   - Mock functions and fake tests create persistent issues in agentic coding
   - If you cannot implement something fully, explain why rather than creating mocks

2. **Concise and Correct**: Optimize for correctness over verbosity
   - Write clean, focused code that does one thing well
   - Avoid over-engineering or unnecessary abstractions
   - Remove commented-out code and excessive documentation
   - Keep functions under 50 lines when possible

3. **File Organization**: Maintain strict file organization
   - Place all markdown documentation in `docs/` subdirectories
   - **CRITICAL**: Never create markdown files in the project root unless it is a README.md
   - Implementation log files like 'FEATURE_IMPLEMENTATION.md' go in `ai_docs/cc_implementation_logs/`
   - **CRITICAL**: All test files (test_*.py, *_test.py, *.test.js, etc.) go in `tests/` directory
   - Never create test files in the project root
   - Use appropriate subdirectories for different file types
   - Follow the established directory structure

4. **Testing First**: Write tests before or alongside implementation
   - Generate tests from specifications
   - Include edge cases and error conditions
   - Aim for high coverage on critical paths
   - Use property-based testing where appropriate

5. **Performance Aware**: Consider performance implications
   - Profile before optimizing
   - Document performance characteristics
   - Use appropriate data structures
   - Minimize context usage in Claude commands
</code_quality>

## ML Research Best Practices

<ml_research_principles>
### Core Research Mindset

1. **Debugging First - The John Carmack Approach**
   - Any shocking or surprising result is 80% likely to be a bug until proven otherwise
   - When encountering unexpected results, ask: "What would John Carmack do?"
   - Be meticulous: break down the problem systematically
   - Triple-check surprising results before accepting them
   - Only after ruling out bugs should you fit theory to data

2. **Healthy Skepticism**
   - Most papers are terrible and don't replicate
   - Most intuitively plausible techniques don't work
   - Most techniques only look good with weak baselines
   - Always implement and test strong baselines for comparison

3. **Research as Exploration**
   - Good ideas often take many tries before working
   - Focus on convincing yourself things are true, not what goes in the paper
   - Don't think about publication while exploring - just satisfy curiosity
   - Once convinced, running final sweeps for publication is easy

4. **Efficiency and Feedback Loops**
   - Feedback loop time is incredibly important
   - Rapid feedback enables much more progress
   - Most people have poor hardware intuition - learn basics to avoid obvious inefficiencies
   - Implementing known techniques is vastly easier than inventing new ones

5. **Managing Long Projects**
   - In complex projects, expect bugs that invalidate weeks/months of work
   - Being careful helps but slows velocity - find the right balance
   - Much work won't impact the final published result - this is unavoidable
   - You'll often be philosophically confused until halfway through

6. **Research Impact and Direction**
   - Research impact is extremely long-tailed
   - Direction matters more than execution - well-executed research in wrong direction is useless
   - Early career: focus on learning and motivation over "maximum importance"
   - Aim for the long tail of impact, not incremental improvements

### Research Process Stages

Following Neel Nanda's framework:

1. **Exploration Stage**
   - North star: Gain information
   - Do exploratory experiments, visualize data, follow curiosity
   - Prioritize moving fast over perfection
   - If stuck, you're probably in exploration but think you're in understanding
   - Keep a highlights doc of interesting results

2. **Understanding Stage**  
   - North star: Test specific hypotheses
   - Design experiments that distinguish between hypotheses
   - Be quantitative and systematic
   - Constantly seek alternative explanations
   - Good experiments elegantly distinguish multiple plausible hypotheses

3. **Distillation Stage**
   - North star: Compress findings into rigorous, communicable truth
   - Writing forces clarity - often reveals gaps
   - Don't leave write-up to last minute
   - Communicate to inform, not persuade
   - Acknowledge limitations explicitly

### Prioritization and Moving Fast

1. **Research as Stochastic Decision Process**
   - Reduce uncertainty at the fastest possible rate
   - Do most informative tasks per unit time first
   - Front-load failure detection (de-risking)
   - Consider both failure probability AND time cost

2. **Avoiding Exponential Search Trees**
   - Rule out entire approaches conceptually before trying variations
   - When something fails, understand WHY to avoid similar failures
   - One failed implementation rarely rules out an approach
   - Systematically prune search space at high levels

3. **Truth-Seeking Above All**
   - Constant active effort required - insufficient skepticism doesn't feel insufficient
   - At least 50% of papers useless due to insufficient skepticism
   - Design experiments assuming you're wrong
   - Red-team your own hypotheses aggressively
   - Track pre-hoc vs post-hoc analyses explicitly

### Paper Writing Best Practices

Following Neel Nanda's framework:

1. **Narrative is Key**
   - Papers should present 1-3 specific concrete claims
   - Everything exists to support the narrative
   - Compress findings - readers won't remember more than a few sentences
   - Write iteratively: abstract → outline → introduction → full draft

2. **Evidence Standards**
   - Quality over quantity in experiments
   - Good experiments distinguish between hypotheses
   - Always include strong baselines
   - Discuss limitations explicitly
   - Statistical rigor: p < 0.001 for exploratory work

3. **Clarity and Accessibility**
   - Write to inform, not persuade
   - Use simple language where possible
   - Define key terms and techniques
   - Spend equal time on: abstract, intro, figures, and everything else
   - Figures are crucial - put significant effort into them

4. **Avoiding Common Pitfalls**
   - Don't leave writing until last minute
   - Don't obsess over publishability at the expense of truth
   - Avoid unnecessary complexity to sound impressive
   - Always acknowledge limitations and negative results

   /crud-claude-commands create paper-to-code
   ```
   For implementing papers:
   - Extract key algorithms
   - Generate test cases
   - Verify correctness
</custom_commands>

<autonomous_command_usage>
### Guiding Principles for Your Custom Commands

When creating commands for your research, consider these patterns:

#### Command Triggers
Design your commands to activate on specific patterns:
- Research-specific terminology
- Repeated workflows
- Common analysis needs
- Debugging scenarios

#### Example Patterns to Implement

1. **Experiment Management**
   ```python
   # When user mentions "run experiment" or "test hypothesis"
   if "experiment" in message or "hypothesis" in message:
       use_command("/run-experiment", config=extract_config())
   ```

2. **Results Analysis**
   ```python
   # When results are generated
   if "results ready" or "analyze output":
       use_command("/analyze-results", metrics=domain_specific_metrics)
   ```

3. **Context Preservation**
   ```python
   # Always monitor context usage
   if context_usage > 0.7:
       suggest_command("/page", reason="preserve progress")
   elif context_usage > 0.8:
       auto_command("/page", name=generate_checkpoint_name())
   ```

#### Building Reliable Automation

1. **Start with Manual Commands**: Run commands manually first to understand patterns
2. **Identify Repetition**: Notice when you use the same command sequence
3. **Create Composite Commands**: Combine common sequences into single commands
4. **Add Verification**: Always include checks to ensure commands worked
5. **Document Failures**: Track when commands fail and why

#### Integration with External Tools
Your custom commands can integrate with:
- Experiment tracking (Weights & Biases, MLflow)
- Compute clusters (SLURM, Ray)
- Version control (Git workflows)
- Data pipelines (DVC, Pachyderm)
- Analysis tools (Jupyter, Pandas)
</autonomous_command_usage>

<autonomous_scripts>
### Autonomous Research Scripts

All slash commands now have programmatic versions in `scripts/commands/` that can be executed autonomously:

#### Codebase Integration
```bash
# Integrate external codebase
python scripts/integrate_codebase.py https://github.com/org/repo.git
```

#### Automatic Context Planning
```bash
# Create implementation plan with automatic context selection
python scripts/commands/plan_auto_context.py "add caching layer to improve API performance"

# With external tools (repomix + Gemini)
python scripts/commands/plan_auto_context.py "implement websocket notifications" --output plan.md
```

#### Orchestrated Workflows
```bash
# Run comprehensive analysis workflow
python scripts/commands/orchestrate_research.py \
    --workflow comprehensive_analysis \
    --codebase ./project \
    --task "Analyze security architecture"
```

#### Multi-Model Coordination
The orchestration script supports:
- Parallel execution of multiple tools
- Custom workflow definitions
- Automatic report generation
- Integration with Gemini, O3, and other models

See `scripts/README.md` for complete documentation.
</autonomous_scripts>

<thinking_guidelines>
## Extended Thinking Usage

For complex problems, I will use extended thinking when you include trigger phrases:
- "think step by step" - Basic reasoning
- "think deeply" - More thorough analysis
- "think harder" - Complex problem solving
- "ultrathink" - Maximum reasoning depth

Best used for:
- Mathematical proofs and derivations
- Architecture decisions with multiple trade-offs
- Debugging subtle issues
- Research hypothesis formation
- Safety analysis and failure mode identification
</thinking_guidelines>

## Best Practices for Maximum Efficiency

<prompting_best_practices>
### Be Explicit and Context-Rich
Instead of: "Implement caching"
Use: "Implement an LRU cache for model embeddings with 10GB capacity, <100ms lookup time, and thread-safe operations. This will be used in production serving 1M+ requests/day."

### Provide Success Examples
<example>
Task: "Create a configuration system"
Good: "Create a configuration system like Hydra that supports:
- Hierarchical configs with overrides
- Type validation using Pydantic
- Environment variable interpolation
- Config versioning for reproducibility
Output should follow this structure:
```yaml
model:
  type: transformer
  params:
    layers: 12
    hidden_dim: 768
```
"
</example>

### Leverage Parallel Operations
"For maximum efficiency, analyze these three papers simultaneously using separate agents:
1. Paper A: Focus on methodology
2. Paper B: Extract experimental results
3. Paper C: Identify limitations
Synthesize findings focusing on common patterns."

### Control Output Format
<formatting>
For structured outputs:
- Use XML tags: "Provide analysis in <findings>, <methodology>, and <limitations> tags"
- Request specific formats: "Output as JSON with schema: {metric: string, value: float, confidence: float}"
- Prefill patterns: "Begin your response with '## Technical Analysis\n### Key Findings:'"
</formatting>
</prompting_best_practices>

## Integration with External Tools

<tool_integration>
### Gemini CLI for Large-Scale Analysis
Use when Claude's context would be exceeded:
```bash
# Analyze entire codebases
gemini -p "@src/ Explain the architecture and identify coupling points"

# Compare multiple papers
gemini -p "@paper1.pdf @paper2.pdf @paper3.pdf Synthesize approaches to adversarial robustness"

# Find patterns across many files
gemini -p "@**/*.py List all custom loss functions with their mathematical formulations"
```

### Git Integration
- Commits: Use conventional commit format (feat:, fix:, docs:, etc.)
- Branches: `feature/<issue-no>-<description>` or `experiment/<name>`
- PRs: Include test results and performance impact

### Testing Frameworks
- Always verify framework first: `grep -r "test_" . | head -5`
- Prefer pytest for Python, jest for JavaScript
- Include property-based tests for critical functions
</tool_integration>

## Session Management Best Practices

<session_management>
1. **Track Progress**: Maintain `todo.md` with checkboxes for complex tasks
2. **Checkpoint Regularly**: `/page` when switching contexts or at major milestones
3. **Resume Gracefully**: `claude --resume <checkpoint>` preserves full context
4. **Clean Up**: Remove temporary files and close unused resources

### Memory Limits and Optimization
- Monitor context usage with `/compact` when >70% full
- Summarize intermediate results rather than keeping full outputs
- Use external storage for large datasets or logs
</session_management>

## Security and Safety Guidelines

<security_guidelines>
1. **Never Expose**: API keys, credentials, or personal information
2. **Validate Inputs**: Sanitize all external data before processing
3. **Audit Outputs**: Review generated code for potential vulnerabilities
4. **Version Control**: Never commit sensitive data, use .gitignore
5. **Access Control**: Implement principle of least privilege
</security_guidelines>

## Common Patterns and Solutions

<common_patterns>
### For Debugging - The John Carmack Approach
When encountering unexpected results or bugs:
1. **Assume it's a bug first** - 80% of surprising results are bugs
2. **Break it down systematically**:
   - Isolate the smallest reproducible case
   - Add extensive logging at each step
   - Verify assumptions with assertions
   - Check data types and shapes at boundaries
   - Validate intermediate results match expectations
3. **Triple-check before accepting** surprising results
4. **Document the debugging process** - helps catch similar issues later

### For Unclear Requirements - Meta-Prompting
When requirements are ambiguous:
1. **Ask for clarification immediately** rather than making assumptions
2. **Specify what's unclear**:
   - "What should happen in edge case X?"
   - "What's the expected format for output Y?"
   - "Should this handle concurrent access?"
3. **Propose concrete options** when multiple interpretations exist
4. **Document assumptions explicitly** if you must proceed without clarification

### For Research Algorithms
"Implement the algorithm ensuring:
- Numerical stability and error propagation analysis
- Comprehensive unit tests with edge cases (NO mock tests)
- Performance benchmarks on relevant datasets
- Memory and computational complexity profiling
- Full reproducibility (seeds, environments, dependencies)
- Systematic ablation study support
- Strong baseline comparisons
Document theoretical foundations, empirical validation, and limitations."

### For Experimental Analysis
"Implement the analysis pipeline with:
- Statistical significance testing (p < 0.001 for exploratory work)
- Multiple hypothesis correction
- Confidence interval calculation
- Effect size estimation
- Robustness checks across conditions
- Visualization of key relationships
- Comparison against strong baselines
Include assumption validation and sensitivity analysis."

### For Research Infrastructure
"Build the experimental framework with:
- Parameter sweep and grid search capabilities
- Distributed computation support
- Checkpoint and recovery mechanisms
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring
- Experiment tracking and versioning
- Automated report generation
- Fast feedback loops for rapid iteration
Ensure reproducibility across different environments and scales."
</common_patterns>

## Notes on Hooks and Automation

<automation>
- Mock data validation: Blocked by default, docs/ exempt
- **File organization validation**: Automatically blocks and redirects misplaced files
  - Markdown files (except README.md) in root → redirected to `ai_docs/cc_implementation_logs/`
  - Test files in root → redirected to `tests/`
  - Provides clear guidance on correct file placement
  - Runs on Write, Edit, and MultiEdit operations
- Git auto-commit: Intelligent selective commits for research sessions
  - Only commits files in: results/, experiments/, specs/, tasks/, issues/, docs/
  - Detects research/experiment sessions from conversation context
  - Generates smart commit messages based on file types and context
  - Logs all actions to ~/.claude/logs/auto-commit.log
- Python formatting: Black runs automatically post-edit
- Activity logging: All actions logged to ~/.claude/research-activity.log
- Test execution: Automatic on file changes matching test_*.py

For detailed automation documentation, see `docs/guides/automation-hooks.md`
</automation>
