# AgenFK Engineering Framework (agenfk)

This skill enforces the core AgenFK Engineering workflow to ensure all software tasks are Agile, Measurable, Visual, Repeatable, Reliable, and Flexible.

## Strict Enforcement Mandate

> **MANDATORY**: You are strictly prohibited from modifying ANY file in the codebase without an active task in `IN_PROGRESS` status and a successful `workflow_gatekeeper` call. Bypassing this workflow is a critical operational failure.

### Hard Block Rules
1. **NO TASK = NO CODE**: If no task is `IN_PROGRESS`, stop immediately and create one.
2. **NO GATE = NO CODE**: Call `workflow_gatekeeper` before the first edit of every session.
3. **NO BYPASS**: Never use `git commit`, `npm test`, or direct file writes to circumvent `validate_progress`.
4. **MEASURE EVERYTHING**: Every task MUST have token usage logged via `log_token_usage` before completion.

## Operation Modes

AgenFK supports two distinct operation modes based on the slash command invoked:

### 1. Standard Mode (via `/agenfk`)
*   **Behavior**: Single-agent, proactive execution.
*   **Workflow**: The agent who starts the task is responsible for the entire lifecycle (Planning, Coding, Verification, and Closing) within a single session.
*   **Mandatory Log**: You MUST call `add_comment(itemId, content)` for EVERY significant tool execution or logical step (e.g. "Analyzed file X", "Implemented function Y", "Running tests").
*   **Proactivity**: For simple requests (TASK/BUG), the agent should proceed directly to implementation after basic analysis.
*   **Verification**: You MUST use `update_item({ status: "REVIEW" })` to enter REVIEW, then call `workflow_gatekeeper(itemId)` to get exit criteria, then `validate_progress` to advance through intermediate steps and reach DONE.
*   **Decomposition**: MANDATORY. Every piece of work must be minimally a **STORY with child TASKS** or an **EPIC with child STORIES and their TASKS**. Direct coding on a STORY or EPIC without child TASKS is prohibited.
*   **Handoff**: None. Do not spawn sub-agents.

### 2. Deep Mode (via `/agenfk-deep`)
*   **Behavior**: Multi-agent, automated orchestration.
*   **Trigger**: Use this mode for complex architectural changes, high-security code, or large features.
*   **Supervisor Pattern**: You act as a supervisor, responsible for decomposing the task and spawning specialized sub-agents via the `task` tool at every phase transition.
*   **Parallel Execution**: Deep Mode supports **parallel execution** of independent tasks.
    - If an EPIC or STORY has multiple independent sub-items, you SHOULD spawn multiple sub-agents simultaneously using the `task` tool.
    - When working in parallel, you MUST pass the `itemId` to the `workflow_gatekeeper(intent, role, itemId)` to authorize changes against the specific task.
*   **Plan & Pause**: Mandatory decomposition into sub-items. You **MUST PAUSE** and obtain human approval of the plan before moving any item to `IN_PROGRESS`.
*   **Automated Handover**:
    - **Coding to Review**: Automatically spawn a "Review Agent" after `update_item({ status: "REVIEW" })`.
    - **Review to Test**: Automatically spawn a "Test Agent" after successful review.
    - **Test to Done**: Automatically spawn a "Closing Agent" after successful testing.

## MCP Access Rules — MANDATORY

**ALWAYS** use MCP tool invocations (`list_items`, `create_item`, `update_item`, `get_item`, etc.) for all workflow state operations.

**NEVER** use any of the following shortcuts — PreToolUse hooks will block them mechanically:

| Forbidden | Use instead |
|-----------|-------------|
| Reading `.agenfk/db.sqlite` or `.agenfk/db.json` directly (via Bash or Read tool) | `list_items(projectId)` · `get_item(id)` |
| `curl` / `wget` to `http://localhost:3000` (direct REST API) | `list_items()` · `create_item()` · `update_item()` |
| `agenfk list`, `agenfk status`, `agenfk get`, `npx agenfk ...` (CLI state queries) | `list_items()` · `get_item()` · `list_projects()` |

If MCP tools are not available in your context, surface the connectivity problem clearly rather than falling back to a bypass route.

## What I do

1.  **Initialization**
    *   **Clean Start from Main (MANDATORY)**:
        1. Run `git status` — if the working tree has uncommitted or modified files, **STOP** and ask the user how to proceed (stash, commit, or discard). Never start new work on a dirty working tree.
        2. Run `git branch --show-current` — if NOT on `main` (or `master`) and the current branch does not belong to an item you're about to resume, run `git checkout main` (or `master`).
        3. Run `git pull` to ensure you have the latest upstream changes.
    *   **Action**:
        1. Check for `.agenfk/project.json` in the project root.
        2. If missing, DO NOT assume an existing project should be reused based on name alone.
        3. Call `list_projects()` via MCP to see existing projects.
        4. **MANDATORY**: Ask the user if they want to use an existing project (by name/ID) or create a new one (recommended).
        5. If creating a new one, use the current directory name as the default project name unless the user specifies otherwise.
        6. Create/link the project by creating `.agenfk/project.json` with the `{ "projectId": "..." }`.
        7. **Flow-Aware Status Check (MANDATORY)**: Immediately after identifying the project, call `GET /projects/<projectId>/flow` (via REST or `agenfk flow show --project <projectId>` via CLI) to discover the active workflow flow. The `workflow_gatekeeper` response also includes `activeFlow`. **Use the flow's step `name` values as the valid statuses for this project** — do NOT assume the default TODO → IN_PROGRESS → REVIEW → TEST → DONE pipeline is active. The project may have a custom flow with different steps and ordering.
        8. Scan the codebase and generate `AFK_PROJECT_SCOPE.md` and `AFK_ARCHITECTURE.md` if they don't exist. BE THOROUGH AND COMPLETE. If generating these, reason about the codebase and ask clarifying questions using the environment's Question UI to confirm architectural decisions before writing the files.
        9. Fetch all items via `list_items(projectId)` and render the **Board Report** as described below.
    *   **Board Report Format**:
        *   **Cycle Time Calculation**: For each item, compute cycle time by finding the time it first entered `IN_PROGRESS` (or similar active state) to the time it entered `DONE`/`ARCHIVED`. If there's no history, fallback to `updatedAt - createdAt` if `DONE`, or `now - createdAt` if active. For items that never started (e.g. `TODO`), cycle time is N/A or 0. Format durations as `HH:MM:SS`.
        *   **Per-card display**: Include a `Cycle Time` column in every status group table.
        *   **Summary Header**: Show a metrics line with:
            - Total token usage (sum of all `tokenUsage[].input + tokenUsage[].output` across all items)
            - Total cycle time (sum of cycle times of all DONE items, formatted as `HH:MM:SS`)
            - Average cycle time across DONE items (total ÷ count, formatted as `HH:MM:SS`)
            - Format: `Tokens: X in / Y out | Cycle Total: HH:MM:SS | Cycle Avg: HH:MM:SS (N tasks)`
    *   **Objective**: Maintain project identity and a living map.

2.  **Request Analysis & Clarification**
    *   **Context**: Take into account `AFK_PROJECT_SCOPE.md` and `AFK_ARCHITECTURE.md` for informed reasoning.
    *   **Action**: Call `analyze_request(request: string)` for every new user requirement.
    *   **Mode Selection**:
        - If the user invoked `/agenfk`, use **Standard Mode**.
        - If the user invoked `/agenfk-deep`, use **Deep Mode**.
    *   **Reasoning Step**: Before creating ANY item or initializing a project, you MUST reason about the implementation details.
    *   **Question UI**: If there are *any* ambiguities, missing technical details, or decisions to be made, you MUST use the environment's native "Question UI" (e.g., `default_api:question` in Opencode, or equivalent in other environments) to ask the user for clarification before proceeding with creation.
    *   **Objective**: Categorize as **EPIC**, **STORY**, **TASK**, or **BUG**.
    *   **Minimum Decomposition Rule**: After exiting plan mode, the type of card that needs to be created is minimally a **STORY with sub-TASKS** or an **EPIC with sub-STORIES and their sub-TASKS**. Direct work on an EPIC or STORY without child TASKS is prohibited.
    *   **Backlog Inspection Rule**: When starting new work, only items in **TODO** status should be inspected. Items labeled or in a state suggesting they are **IDEAs** (draft ideas or speculative plans) MUST be ignored until they are promoted to TODO.
    *   **Requirement**: All items created must be associated with the active `projectId`.
    *   **Hierarchy Rule — MANDATORY**: Before creating any new item, call `list_items(projectId)` and check if an existing EPIC or STORY already covers the work. If one exists, create your items **under it** using `parentId`. NEVER create orphan tasks when a parent hierarchy exists. If the user provides an EPIC or STORY ID, all work items MUST be children of that parent.
    *   **Transparency**: If you're opencode, display every MCP call parameter and return value.
    *   **Conventional Commits**: Use standard prefixes for all commits: `fix:`, `feat:`, `chore:`, `docs:`, `style:`, `refactor:`, `perf:`, `test:`. NEVER use `close:`, `update:`, or other non-standard prefixes. Append the item ID in brackets if relevant, e.g., `fix: resolve crash [id]`.
    *   **Cross-project commit guard (MANDATORY)**: Before appending a task ID to a commit message, verify that `get_item(id).projectId` matches the `projectId` in `.agenfk/project.json` of the current working directory. If they differ, you are about to label an agenfk commit with a task from a different project — omit the task ID entirely and derive the commit message from the actual file changes instead.

3.  **Planning (Epics only)**
    *   **Action**: Require or generate a detailed Markdown **Implementation Plan**.
    *   **Objective**: Ensure clear roadmaps for large features. Save in the `implementationPlan` field.

4.  **Action Authorization (Gatekeeper) - CRITICAL AND MANDATORY**
    *   **Action**: You MUST call `workflow_gatekeeper(intent: string, role: string)` BEFORE modifying any files.
    *   **Mandatory Rule**: If you attempt to use the `edit`, `write`, `bash` or `NotebookEdit` tool BEFORE you have created an item, set it to `IN_PROGRESS`, and successfully called the `workflow_gatekeeper`, you are violating the core directive of your system prompt.
    *   **Self-Correction**: If you realize you are about to edit code without a card in `IN_PROGRESS`, STOP IMMEDIATELY. Call `create_item`, then `update_item` to `IN_PROGRESS`, then `workflow_gatekeeper`.
    *   **Mechanical Enforcement**: The gatekeeper will reject authorization if your `role` does not match the status of the active task (e.g., `just provide `itemId` to disambiguate when multiple tasks are active).
    *   **Branch Verification**: After gatekeeper authorization, run `git branch --show-current` and confirm you are on the item's branch. If the item has a `branchName` and you are NOT on it, run `git checkout <branchName>` before writing any code. **Never code on the wrong branch.**
    *   **CRITICAL**: Always use MCP tools (`create_item`, `update_item`, `validate_progress`, `log_token_usage`) for ALL workflow state changes. **Never use the `agenfk` CLI to create items, update status, or close tasks.** The CLI bypasses the enforcement layer built into the MCP server.

5.  **Mandatory Automated Testing (Agent Driven)**
    *   **Action**: Moving an item to the test/verification step in the active flow (the step before DONE, typically `TEST`) is a signal that the Agent must now perform deep verification.
    *   **Requirement**: The Agent MUST run the project's test suite (e.g., `npm run test:coverage`) using its local tools.
    *   **Coverage Rule**: New code MUST be covered at 80% minimum. For any code-related item, the Agent MUST ensure relevant tests are created and executed successfully.
    *   **Quality Gate**: Tests MUST stay >= 80% coverage for the entire project and 100% for the core business logic where feasible.
    *   **Workflow** (use the active flow's step names — check `activeFlow` from `workflow_gatekeeper` response):
        *   `update_item(itemId, { status: "<review-step>" })` moves items from the active coding step to the review step when coding is complete (default: `REVIEW`).
        *   Call `workflow_gatekeeper(itemId)` before calling `validate_progress` — the response includes the current step's exit criteria.
        *   `validate_progress(itemId, evidence, command?)` — `evidence` is **required**: describe concretely how you satisfied the current step's exit criteria. It is logged as a tagged comment (audit trail) and serves as your mandatory confirmation before the step advances. Runs `command` (or `project.verifyCommand` if omitted) and advances to the next flow step on success.
        *   The Agent verifies coverage and regressions in each intermediate step.
        *   Call `validate_progress(itemId, evidence="<how you satisfied this step>")` (no command) for the final step — this uses the project's `verifyCommand` and moves to DONE. If it returns `NO_VERIFY_COMMAND`, the agent auto-detects the project stack from config files (e.g. `package.json`, `Cargo.toml`, `go.mod`, `*.csproj`), sets the command via `update_project({ id, verifyCommand })`, and retries. Do NOT use `update_item({status: "DONE"})` — the server blocks direct DONE transitions.
        *   Failure: Agent moves item back to the active coding step.
    *   **Sibling Propagation**: When child items of the same parent share the same source code, a single `validate_progress` call validates the code for all siblings. After one passes, move remaining siblings to the same step via `update_item`, then call `validate_progress` on each to reach DONE.

6.  **Final Verification (Validate Tool)**
    *   **Action**: After self-review, the Agent calls `workflow_gatekeeper(itemId)` to get the current step's exit criteria, then calls `validate_progress(itemId, evidence, command?)` to gate the transition to the next step.
    *   **Test Suite Enforcement**: The project's `verifyCommand` (set via `update_project`) is used automatically when no `command` is provided. Agents cannot override or bypass it.
    *   **Transition Logic (Automated by Tool)**:
        1. The agent advances the item past the coding step via `update_item`.
        2. The agent performs self-review (re-reads files, checks correctness).
        3. The agent calls `validate_progress(itemId, evidence="<concrete description of how exit criteria were met>", command?)` — logs evidence as a tagged comment, runs the command, and advances to the next flow step.
        4. Success: Advances to the next step. Failure: Moves back to the coding step. Repeat for each intermediate step until DONE.

7.  **Measurement & Tracking**
    *   **Reporting Requirements**: The Agent **MUST** call `log_token_usage(itemId, input, output, model)` immediately after marking an item as `DONE` (e.g., following a successful `validate_progress`), or at the end of a significant session of work for an `IN_PROGRESS` item.
    *   **Progress Comments**: The Agent **MUST** call `add_comment(itemId, content)` for EVERY significant step performed during implementation (e.g. "Modified core types", "Updated UI components", "Ran tests"). This ensures the human user can follow the agent's work in real-time on the Kanban board.
    *   **Estimation**: If exact token counts are not available in the environment, the Agent **MUST** provide a reasonable estimate. **Do not skip this step.**
    *   **Completion — Bottom-Up Closure (MANDATORY)**: When closing work, you MUST close the entire hierarchy bottom-up. Use the active flow's step names (check `activeFlow` in `workflow_gatekeeper` response):
        1. Close all child TASKs first: advance past the coding step via `update_item`, self-review, then call `validate_progress(id, evidence="<evidence>")` for each intermediate step until DONE.
           - **Sibling shortcut**: If one child's `validate_progress` already advanced past a step, move remaining siblings to that step via `update_item`. Then call `validate_progress(id, evidence="<evidence>")` on each — subsequent calls pass immediately via sibling propagation.
        2. Then close parent STORYs (propagates automatically when all children are DONE).
        3. Then close the EPIC (propagates automatically when all STORYs are DONE).
        NEVER leave cards stuck in intermediate steps. You are responsible for progressing each item all the way to DONE.
        NEVER use `update_item({status: "DONE"})` — the server rejects direct DONE transitions. Always use `validate_progress(id, evidence="<evidence>")` to close an item.
    *   **Post-Completion Prompt (MANDATORY)**: After an item (TASK, STORY, BUG, or EPIC) has been moved to `DONE`, the Agent **MUST** ask the user what they would like to do next, providing exactly these three options:
        1. **Release**: Run `/agenfk-release` to create a new release.
        2. **New Task**: Start a new session for a new task, epic, or bug (by calling `/clear` followed by `/agenfk`).
        3. **Continue Current**: Keep working on the current item (the Agent MUST then ask what else should be included and move the item back to `IN_PROGRESS`).

## Quality Guards — MANDATORY

### Feature Implementation
- **End-to-end verification**: After implementing any feature, verify it works end-to-end by tracing the full path from UI interaction to backend response. Do not mark a feature as complete until you've confirmed the UI actually triggers the expected behavior.
- **Evidence-based claims**: Before claiming a feature already exists or is implemented, search the actual codebase for the specific UI components, API endpoints, and database queries. Never assume implementation status without evidence.

### Bug & Error Fixing
- **Root cause first**: When debugging errors, investigate the root cause fully before applying fixes. Avoid adding workarounds (like force-relogin) that can create new problems (infinite loops). Trace errors from the symptom back to the actual source.
- **One fix at a time**: Apply a single targeted fix, verify it resolves the issue, then move on. Do not stack multiple speculative fixes.
