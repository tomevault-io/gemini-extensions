Let's define the project directory conventions for our Next.js and MongoDB specialist agent. This will ensure consistency, maintainability, and clear separation of concerns, which are vital in production environments.

**Project Directory Conventions:**

The agent will understand and adhere to the following project structure and conventions for a typical Next.js application using the **App Router** and MongoDB:

```

```

**Key Conventions and Rationales:**

1.  **`src/` Directory:** All application source code lives here. This is a common practice in larger projects for better organization.
    *   **Rationale:** Clearly separates application code from configuration files and static assets.
2.  **`app/` (Next.js App Router):** Follows Next.js's official App Router structure.
    *   **Route Groups `(folder-name)/`:** Used for organizing routes without affecting the URL path (e.g., `(auth)` for login/register).
    *   **`api/`:** Dedicated directory for API routes. `route.ts` is the standard for App Router API handlers.
    *   **Dynamic Routes `[slug]`:** Standard Next.js convention for dynamic segments.
    *   **`layout.tsx`, `page.tsx`:** Standard App Router files.
    *   **`globals.css`:** Centralized global styles, often imported into the root `layout.tsx`.
3.  **`components/`:**
    *   **`ui/`:** For highly reusable, often unstyled (or styled via a framework like Tailwind) components that are generic in nature (e.g., Button, Input, Modal). These could also come from a headless UI library.
    *   **`specific/`:** For components that are more tightly coupled to specific features or data structures (e.g., `UserProfileCard`, `ProductDetails`).
    *   **`shared/`:** For components like `Navbar`, `Footer`, `Sidebar` that are used across multiple layouts or major sections.
    *   **Rationale:** Promotes reusability, modularity, and makes it easier to locate specific types of components.
4.  **`lib/`:** This is a crucial directory for backend/server-side logic, database interactions, and core utilities.
    *   **`lib/db/`:**
        *   **`connect.ts`:** Handles the single, reusable MongoDB connection.
        *   **`models/`:** All Mongoose schema definitions go here. Each model in its own file.
        *   **`utils.ts`:** Any database-specific helper functions (e.g., `populateUserWithPosts`).
    *   **`lib/auth.ts`:** NextAuth.js configuration, session management helpers, server-side authentication checks.
    *   **`lib/utils.ts`:** General, non-UI, non-DB utility functions (e.g., `formatDate`, `validateEmail`).
    *   **`lib/constants.ts`:** Global constants used throughout the application.
    *   **Rationale:** Decouples core logic from UI components and API routes. Enforces a single source of truth for database interactions and utilities. `lib` functions are typically used by API routes and Server Components.
5.  **`hooks/`:** Custom React Hooks for encapsulating reusable stateful logic.
    *   **Rationale:** Promotes code reuse and clean component logic.
6.  **`types/`:** Centralized TypeScript interfaces and types.
    *   **Rationale:** Improves type safety and consistency across the application. Using `index.d.ts` allows for easy import without specifying the file.
7.  **`services/`:** Contains business logic and data fetching functions that might be consumed by client components, or even server components if they need a layer of abstraction over direct DB calls (though for simple cases, direct DB calls in server components are fine).
    *   **Rationale:** Provides an additional layer of abstraction for complex data operations or when needing to reuse data fetching logic across client and server boundaries. Think of these as a wrapper around `lib/db` models, potentially adding more complex business rules.
8.  **`.env.local`:** Standard for environment variables in Next.js.
9.  **`next.config.mjs`, `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `tailwind.config.ts`:** Standard configuration files.

**Agent's Adherence:**

The agent will strictly follow these conventions when:

*   Generating new files or components.
*   Suggesting locations for new code snippets.
*   Referencing existing files.
*   Explaining file structure in its architectural overviews.
*   Ensuring imports/exports align with this structure.

This detailed convention guide ensures the agent's output is not only functional but also integrates seamlessly into a well-structured and maintainable Next.js project.
