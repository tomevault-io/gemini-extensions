> Build an evidence-first, self-hostable DAO3 / dao3.fun compatibility path that can run a real map with both client and server Script Runtimes.

# NEA Project Agent Rules

## Mission

Build an evidence-first, self-hostable DAO3 / dao3.fun compatibility path that can run a real map with both client and server Script Runtimes.

## Repository boundaries

- `Frontend/demo-map/`: executable demo, importer, runtime integration, and validation.
- `Middleware/runtime-compat/`: ABI catalogs, reports, fixtures, and conformance tests.
- `Backend/local-player/`: Player hosting and compatibility backend.
- `Evidence/preservation-dump/`: bounded capture/export tooling.
- `Evidence/origin/`, `Shared/mudb/`, `Evidence/dao3-docs-mirror/`, `Evidence/dump/`: evidence and historical inputs, not new runtime architecture.
- `Evidence/works/`: public catalog and ignored private work sources.
- `Docs/`: project governance, architecture, progress, and AI context.
- `Docs/zh/`: Chinese user-facing guidance only.
- `tools/`: maintenance helpers.

## Safety and evidence

- Never publish or modify private captures, credentials, browser state, token-bearing URLs, private maps, ignored reference worktrees, `Evidence/dump/private/`, `Evidence/works/private/`, `.workspace/`, or `NEA-Project.7z`.
- Do not invent historical behavior. Use `compatible`, `partial`, `recovered-only`, `declared-only`, or evidence-deferred classifications.
- Keep evidence, generated reports, and executable implementation separate.
- Do not use names, paths, imports, or runtime dependencies belonging to external bypass/外挂 projects in scripts or implementation code.
- Replace external references with a neutral in-repository evidence path, an explicit configuration input, or a rebuilt local fixture before implementation work continues.

## Change discipline

- Read the relevant package docs and tests before editing.
- Work on one task ID at a time and keep the change within its declared scope.
- Prefer the smallest root-cause fix; avoid unrelated refactors and broad cleanup during feature work.
- Add or update focused conformance tests for runtime behavior changes.
- Do not run broad tests or builds unless the user asks; report the exact commands that should be run.
- Do not commit, push, reset, clean, rebase, change remotes, or move repository directories without explicit user approval.

## Patch tool requirement

- After implementation approval, all file edits must use `D:\Projects\Gaming\NEA-Project\tools\apply_patch.ps1`.
- Do not edit files with `Set-Content`, `Out-File`, `Add-Content`, direct redirection, ad hoc Python/Node rewrites, or shell replacement commands.
- The patch wrapper preserves UTF-8 input through a temporary UTF-8 file before invoking Python; do not bypass it on Windows.
- Before applying a patch, confirm approval, allowed write scope, and exclusion of private/generated/forbidden paths.
- After applying a patch, inspect `git diff --check`, `git diff --stat`, and only the changed regions required for verification.
- Analysis-only tasks must not call the patch tool.

## Analysis and refactor gate

- Architecture-analysis tasks are read-only. Do not modify source code, tests, generated outputs, package manifests, configuration, or directory structure during analysis.
- Before editing, produce a responsibility map, dependency map, mutable-state map, external-IO map, test-gap list, and one smallest safe implementation task.
- Do not approve a refactor merely because a file is large. Identify cohesive responsibilities, hidden initialization order, event listeners, timers, process lifecycle, and circular-dependency risks first.
- Do not split a large file into thin forwarding modules. Every extracted module must own a cohesive responsibility and reduce coupling.
- Do not rename or delete a referenced path until callers, generators, tests, reports, documentation, ignore rules, and provenance have been audited.
- After analysis, stop and request approval before implementation when the task is an architecture or migration phase.

## Token efficiency

- Start with `git status --short`, a targeted file search, or a narrow test; do not dump the whole repository tree or large files.
- Use `rg -n` to locate symbols first, then read only the surrounding lines required for the task.
- Do not reread a file after a successful patch unless verification requires it; inspect the diff instead.
- Keep shell output bounded with `Select-Object -First`, `-Last`, or a focused pattern filter.
- Never send complete logs, generated bundles, caches, or minified assets to an AI agent. Summarize failures locally first.
- Reuse `Docs/ai/project-context.md` and one task-specific context instead of repeating repository background in every prompt.
- One task ID, one acceptance contract, and one declared write scope per agent turn.
- End each turn with a compact handoff containing changed files, validation, risks, and exactly one next action.
- Prefer a single grouped shell command over many overlapping inspection calls.

## Maintainability gate

The project prioritizes maintainability over one-off execution. These rules are mandatory for new or substantially modified implementation code.

- Keep interface, application/service, evidence/data access, and utility concerns separated. Do not place protocol parsing, business decisions, filesystem access, and HTTP/Player orchestration in one function.
- Keep ordinary business functions at or below 80 lines and utility functions at or below 50 lines. Split longer functions unless the file is generated or a compatibility adapter requires a documented exception.
- Keep ordinary implementation files at or below 500 lines. Generated catalogs, manifests, minified bundles, and archived evidence are exempt but must not be edited as hand-written source.
- Extract shared logic when similar behavior appears three or more times. Do not copy and paste protocol, validation, logging, or error handling branches.
- Replace magic numbers and strings with named constants or configuration. Validate all external input for presence, type, format, and range.
- Keep conditional nesting at three levels or less. Prefer guard clauses, extracted functions, and explicit strategy maps over long conditional ladders or chained ternaries.
- Never swallow exceptions. Distinguish expected domain failures from system failures, preserve the cause, and emit useful structured diagnostics at important boundaries.
- Add boundary validation, timeout behavior, and failure handling for filesystem, network, subprocess, and runtime bridge calls.
- Explain why for non-obvious compatibility workarounds. Do not leave stale commented-out code or debug output.
- New dependencies require a short justification, a version/compatibility check, and confirmation that the standard library or an existing dependency is insufficient.
- Add focused tests for new behavior and regression tests for fixed failures. Do not mark a task complete based only on a successful happy path.
- Do not use the maintainability limits to justify speculative over-abstraction. Prefer small cohesive modules and a clear seam over a framework.

## Evidence migration gate

- A neutral evidence fixture may contain only facts traceable to an approved local source, capture, declaration, or reviewed artifact.
- Never replace missing evidence with plausible defaults, inferred values, copied external source, or path-existence claims.
- Missing evidence must remain `evidence-blocked`, `evidence-deferred`, `partial`, or another honest classification.
- Never hand-edit generated ABI, compatibility, or evidence reports to remove old provenance or make counts look complete. Change the generator or evidence input, then regenerate.
- Every evidence fixture must identify its source class, redaction status, public/private status, and reproducibility limits.

## AI self-review before completion

Before reporting completion, check:

1. Is each changed function within the size limit, or is the exception documented?
2. Did any similar logic get copied instead of extracted?
3. Are external inputs, IO, timeouts, and errors handled explicitly?
4. Are magic values named and configuration-driven where appropriate?
5. Is nesting shallow and are branches easy to test?
6. Are logs actionable without exposing private data or tokens?
7. Is there a focused test or a clearly recorded validation blocker?
8. Did the change preserve the repository layer boundaries and evidence policy?

## Current priority

Make the real-map client/server runtime loop work before broad physics coverage, full API completion, or frontend polish.

## Language requirement

- All AI-assisted development instructions, plans, code reasoning, task descriptions, commit-style summaries, and validation reports must be written in English.
- Code identifiers, tests, diagnostics, and technical documentation created for the implementation should use English unless a user-facing product requirement explicitly requires another language.
- Chinese project guidance belongs under `Docs/zh/`; do not mix Chinese prose into the English engineering docs.
- If the user asks a question in Chinese, the agent may answer the user in Chinese, but any development artifact or instruction intended for another AI agent must remain in English.

## Task completion format

End implementation work with:

```text
Changed:
- path: short description

Validation:
- command: result or not run

Risks:
- unresolved behavior or privacy concern

Next:
- one concrete follow-up task
```
