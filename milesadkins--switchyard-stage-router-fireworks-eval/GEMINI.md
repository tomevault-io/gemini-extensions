# AGENTS.md — Switchyard

Switchyard is a Python library for LLM traffic orchestration. It sits between client applications (Claude Code, OpenAI / Anthropic SDK clients, Codex CLI) and LLM backends, handling routing, format translation, logging, A/B testing, and health-aware multi-endpoint serving.

> **Note:** The public distribution is `nemo-switchyard`. All imports use `switchyard.*`,
> and the CLI command is `switchyard` (registered via `pyproject.toml` scripts).

## Engineering Guidelines

Working principles for any agent (or human) writing code in this repo. These are
about *how* to work; project-specific conventions and validation commands live
elsewhere in this `AGENTS.md`.

### 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them — don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

### 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

### 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it — don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

### 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:

```text
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

### 5. Comments Explain Code, Not Project Management

**Source comments are about the code. Tracking lives in the tracker.**

- No issue/PLAN/step references in code (`TODO(step-6)`, "lands in step 4",
  "tracked as ISSUE-001", links to `docs/issues/`). These rot the moment the
  plan changes and leak project-management state into source.
- A plain `// TODO:` describing a concrete code gap is fine; a `// TODO`
  pointing at a tracker step is not.
- Comment what isn't obvious from the code: why a thing is done this way,
  invariants, non-obvious edge cases. Don't narrate what the code already says.
- Module doc comments should state what the module is *for*, not its build
  schedule or its "empty for now" status.

### 6. Commit Discipline

**One step, one reviewed, one-line commit.**

- One focused commit per step; every changed line traces to that step.
- Single-line commit message in Conventional Commits form
  (`type(scope): summary`). No body, no `Co-Authored-By` trailer.
- Pull request titles use the same Conventional Commits form.
- Use `git commit -s` so every commit carries the required DCO sign-off.
- Never commit unprompted. Show the diff, get approval, then commit.

Before repairing DCO, inspect every affected commit:

```bash
git log origin/main..HEAD --format='%h %an <%ae> %s'
```

If every affected commit is yours, add the trailers and update the remote safely:

```bash
git rebase origin/main --signoff
git push --force-with-lease origin HEAD
```

For a mixed-author branch, use an interactive rebase and mark only your unsigned commits for
editing. At each stop, run `git commit --amend --no-edit --signoff`, then
`git rebase --continue`. Never add your sign-off to another contributor's commit.

**These guidelines are working if:** fewer unnecessary changes in diffs, fewer rewrites due to overcomplication, and clarifying questions come before implementation rather than after mistakes.

### 7. Review Discipline

- Verify every finding against the current code path before reporting it.
- Draft findings before posting review comments unless the user explicitly asks you to post them.
- Resolve only your own review threads, and only after verifying the fix in code.

## Task-Specific Skills

The repository keeps a small set of optional runbooks under `.agents/skills/`. Read a skill only
when its description directly matches the task. Ordinary code exploration, implementation,
testing, and review do not require loading a skill.

| Skill | Use it for |
|---|---|
| `publish-python-release` | Python wheel artifacts, PyPI releases, and release workflow changes |
| `switchyard-coding-agent-launchers` | Claude Code, Codex, or OpenClaw launcher behavior |
| `switchyard-docs` | Published MkDocs pages, strict builds, previews, and docs CI |
| `switchyard-rust-review` | Focused review of Rust, PyO3, async, streaming, and crate boundaries |
| `switchyard-stage-router-scorer` | Replaying benchmark trajectories through the stage-router scorer and picker |
| `switchyard-testing-ci` | Selecting non-obvious validation or diagnosing CI failures |

Skills should contain stable operational constraints, not mutable architecture inventories. Read the
current source and CI workflows for implementation details.

## Architecture: staged chain

Everything flows through a fixed-shape chain enforced at construction time:

```
request-side component* → LLMBackend → response-side component* → TranslationEngine
```

The chain executor is `Switchyard` (`switchyard/lib/switchyard.py`). `LLMBackend` is the shared
Python role class re-exported from `switchyard/lib/roles.py`; native implementations register with
it, and request-side and response-side processors are plain async components with `process(...)`
methods.
Direct Rust bindings for migrated concrete processors/backends are exposed from
`switchyard_rust.components` and implemented under `crates/switchyard-py/src/component_bindings/`.

| Stage | Binding | Method | Purpose |
|------|-----|--------|---------|
| Request component | Plain Python/Rust object | `async process(ctx, request) -> ChatRequest` | Pre-process (routing, buffering, auth) |
| `LLMBackend` | `switchyard.lib.roles` | `async call(ctx, request) -> ChatResponse` | Make the LLM call. Exactly one per chain. |
| Response component | Plain Python/Rust object | `async process(ctx, response) -> ChatResponse` | Post-process (logging, stats) |
| `TranslationEngine` | `switchyard_rust.translation` | `async translate(ctx, request, response) -> Any` | Convert to client's wire format |

## Tech Stack

- **Python 3.12+**, async-first (asyncio)
- **FastAPI + Uvicorn** for HTTP (`nemo-switchyard[server]`), **sse-starlette** for SSE streaming
- **OpenAI SDK** (`openai>=2.30`) — primary client; the translation engine converts all inbound formats to Chat Completions
- **Anthropic SDK** (`anthropic>=0.94`)
- **httpx** for direct HTTP (health polling, Anthropic Messages)
- **uv** as the package manager (preferred over pip)
- **pytest + pytest-asyncio** for testing, **respx** for HTTP mocking
- **ruff** for linting, **mypy** (strict) for type checking

## Setup

```bash
uv sync               # Core + dev tooling (dev is uv's default group)
uv sync --group dev   # Explicit form, equivalent to the above
source .venv/bin/activate
```

`dev` lives in `[dependency-groups]` (PEP 735), not in `[project.optional-dependencies]`,
so it is **not** advertised in the published wheel's METADATA — pytest, ruff, mypy,
and their transitives never appear in downstream vulnerability scans.

## Commands

### Running the server

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."       # or NVIDIA_API_KEY / ANTHROPIC_API_KEY where supported
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="sk-or-..." # pass with --api-key or save via configure

# Serve a routing bundle. Routes live in YAML; see docs/routing_algorithms/overview.md.
switchyard --routing-profiles routes.yaml -- serve --port 4000

# One-command launchers — single-model passthrough via --model
switchyard launch claude --model openai/gpt-4o-mini \
    --base-url https://openrouter.ai/api/v1 --api-key "$OPENROUTER_API_KEY"
switchyard launch codex --model openai/gpt-4o-mini \
    --base-url https://openrouter.ai/api/v1 --api-key "$OPENROUTER_API_KEY"

# Launchers default to built-in LLM-classifier routing; tune the tiers:
switchyard launch claude \
    --weak-model openai/gpt-4o-mini --classifier-model openai/gpt-4o \
    --classifier-min-confidence 0.6

# Verification and saved config
switchyard verify --model openai/gpt-4o-mini
switchyard configure --show
```

### Testing

```bash
# Unit tests — no API keys needed
uv run pytest tests/ -v

# Single test file / function
uv run pytest tests/test_switchyard.py -v
uv run pytest tests/test_random_routing_llm_backend.py::test_server_config -v

# Live end-to-end tests are not part of the public test suite; if you write
# one, set the provider key explicitly and run it directly, e.g.:
#   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-... uv run pytest tests/your_e2e_test.py -v -x

# Lint / type check (run before every commit)
uv run ruff check .
uv run mypy switchyard
```

### Adding a new component

1. Pick the right stage: request component (pre-call), response component (post-call), `LLMBackend` (rare), or Rust translation codec work.
2. Create a file with the explicit name (`snake_case` of the class name), one class per file.
3. Implement the async method for that stage (`process` for components, `call` for backends).
4. Wire into the owning programmatic profile config or route-bundle builder.
5. Add tests under `tests/`.
6. Export from the relevant `__init__.py` and from `switchyard/__init__.py`'s `__all__`.

### Example: custom request component

```python
from switchyard.lib.proxy_context import ProxyContext
from switchyard import ChatRequest


class MyRequestComponent:
    async def process(self, ctx: ProxyContext, request: ChatRequest) -> ChatRequest:
        ctx.metadata["my_key"] = "my_value"
        return request
```

### Profiles and app factory

```python
from switchyard import PassthroughProfileConfig, ProfileSwitchyard, build_switchyard_app
import uvicorn

switchyard = ProfileSwitchyard(PassthroughProfileConfig(
    api_key="sk-...",
    base_url="https://api.openai.com/v1",
).build())
uvicorn.run(build_switchyard_app(switchyard), port=4000)
```

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | API key for OpenAI-compatible backends |
| `OPENAI_BASE_URL` | Base URL for OpenAI-compatible API |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | API key for Anthropic Claude |
| `NVIDIA_API_KEY` | API key for NVIDIA NIM / Inference Hub |
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | OpenRouter key for examples and saved provider setup; pass via `--api-key` or `switchyard configure` |
| `SWITCHYARD_INTAKE_CAPTURE_CONTENT` | Set truthy to include prompt/response text in intake; default off (metadata-only) |

## Code Style

- **Line length**: 100 chars (ruff, E501 ignored)
- **Target version**: Python 3.12 — use `X | Y` union syntax
- **Imports**: sorted by ruff (`I` rules). Use `TYPE_CHECKING` guards for circular imports.
- **File naming**: file name = `snake_case` of its primary class. One class per file when practical.
- **Type hints**: throughout. `py.typed` marker present; mypy runs strict.
- **Async**: async-only. If you need sync, use `asyncio.run()`.
- **Testing**: `respx` for HTTP mocking, `pytest-mock` for general mocking. `asyncio_mode = "auto"` — no `@pytest.mark.asyncio` needed.
- **Rust**: do not use `.expect()` in Rust source or tests. Propagate errors with `?`,
  return typed errors, or match explicitly in tests so failures stay intentional and visible.
- **Comments**: For Rust changes, add concise comments for module/file intent, public structs/enums,
  public methods, private helpers with non-obvious behavior, and tests that encode important
  behavior. Prefer one-line comments when enough. Add block comments before complex validation,
  routing, config-building, async, lifecycle, or concurrency logic.
- **Docstrings**: Add docstrings for public functions, classes, methods, and API entry points. In
  Rust, use `///` doc comments for public items; in Python, use concise triple-quoted docstrings.
  Public docs should state what the API does, important invariants, and error behavior when relevant.

## Boundaries

### Always do
- File name = snake_case of the primary class exported. Rename on touch.
- Run `uv run ruff check .` (zero errors) and `uv run pytest tests/` before pushing.
- Export new public classes from `switchyard/__init__.py` with `__all__`.
- Write unit tests for new roles and bug fixes.
- Use `ProxyContext.metadata` for cross-component state within a request.
- In a new `LLMBackend`, map upstream context-window 4xx to `SwitchyardError::ContextWindowExceeded` (Rust) — the chain executor uses it for evict-and-retry. See [Context-Window Handling](docs/context_window.md).

### Ask first
- Modifying `pyproject.toml` dependencies.
- Changes to the chain shape or public role classes in `switchyard/lib/roles.py`.
- Adding new HTTP endpoints.
- Removing or renaming any public API currently in `switchyard/__init__.__all__`.

### Never do
- Commit API keys or secrets (`secrets/` is gitignored).
- Remove or rename public API exports without an explicit deprecation plan.
