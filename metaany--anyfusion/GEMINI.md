# Repository Guidelines

## Start Here

AnyFusion is the public product name. `MetaClaw`, `metaclaw`, and `Metaclaw*`
remain internal/runtime names and the compatibility CLI alias. Do not rename them
during unrelated work.

Read only what the task needs, in this order:

1. [`CONTEXT.md`](CONTEXT.md) — current contracts, domain vocabulary, runtime
   invariants, and product boundaries.
2. [`docs/current/technical-overview.md`](docs/current/technical-overview.md) —
   full runtime, deployment, configuration, and repository overview.
3. [`docs/adr/README.md`](docs/adr/README.md) — accepted decisions and the
   authority matrix. Read [ADR-0020](docs/adr/0020-core-module-ownership-and-dependency-direction.md)
   before architecture or roadmap work.
4. [`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md) — current docs, plans, operational notes,
   and archives.

Authority order: code and tests, accepted ADRs, [`CONTEXT.md`](CONTEXT.md), current
technical docs, active plans, then archived material. [`docs/archive/`](docs/archive/) is
historical unless a current authority explicitly cites it.

## Repository Map

MetaClaw is a Node 22.19+ TypeScript ESM CLI/TUI. `src/index.ts` is the composition
root. Detailed ownership and dependency rules live in
[ADR-0020](docs/adr/0020-core-module-ownership-and-dependency-direction.md).

Main entry points:

- [`anyfusion`](anyfusion) — native Linux server launcher and worktree smoke entry.
- [`src/index.ts`](src/index.ts) — composition and mode selection.
- [`src/session/metaclaw-session.ts`](src/session/metaclaw-session.ts) — Application Shell.
- [`src/planning/anyfusion-planning-agent.ts`](src/planning/anyfusion-planning-agent.ts) and
  [`src/planning/planner-process-runner.ts`](src/planning/planner-process-runner.ts) — Planner boundary.
- [`src/kernel/control-kernel.ts`](src/kernel/control-kernel.ts) and
  [`src/kernel/kernel-workflow.ts`](src/kernel/kernel-workflow.ts) — policy and
  durable control seam.
- [`src/execution/kernel-execution-runtime.ts`](src/execution/kernel-execution-runtime.ts) and
  [`src/execution/subtask-attempt-runner.ts`](src/execution/subtask-attempt-runner.ts) — execution chain.
- [`src/tui-bridge/planner-tui-bridge.ts`](src/tui-bridge/planner-tui-bridge.ts) and
  [`src/tui-bridge/planner-tui-process.ts`](src/tui-bridge/planner-tui-process.ts) — default native Planner TUI adapter.
- [`src/tui/app.tsx`](src/tui/app.tsx) — preserved standby Ink UI; it is not the default local surface.
- [`src/gateway/server.ts`](src/gateway/server.ts) and
  [`src/gateway/feishu-runtime.ts`](src/gateway/feishu-runtime.ts) — remote surfaces.

Tests mirror source domains under [`tests/`](tests/). Scenarios and fixtures are in
[`examples/`](examples/); Docker and smoke orchestration are in [`docker/`](docker/) and
[`scripts/`](scripts/).

## Working Rules

- Preserve ADR-0020's ownership and dependency direction. Detailed runtime rules
  belong in `CONTEXT.md`, not this file.
- The sibling AnyFusion-Pi fork is the default local Planner surface. Its Task panel and
  bridge are presentation/Application-Shell adapters only: they may project state and hand a
  Planner proposal to the existing validation path, but may not mutate storage, schedule work,
  authorize execution, or control an Executor.
- The Ink TUI under `src/tui/` is a preserved standby module. Do not delete its editor,
  completion, panels, progress, Guidance, Feishu, activity-state behavior, tests, or Ink/React
  dependencies. Do not invest migration work in it unless a separate restoration plan is approved.
- Do not add a second semantic router, Runtime-owned recovery policy, Planner
  storage mutation, or pre-release compatibility path without an ADR.
- Persistence changes must follow `CONTEXT.md` and update repositories and Docker
  tests together.
- Architecture changes must update the applicable ADR, `CONTEXT.md`, current
  technical overview, and this guide only when onboarding/navigation changes.

## Build And Validation

- `npm install`, `npm run dev`, `npm run build`, `npm run start`
- `npm run lint`, `npm test`, `npm run test:watch`
- `anyfusion --check`, `anyfusion`, `anyfusion --no-build`
- `anyfusion smoke --scenario artifact` — native host-process end-to-end gate.
- `npm run smoke:metaclaw` — native Planner-session smoke.
- `npm run smoke:metaclaw -- --scenario artifact` — Planner-to-Executor artifact
  gate; see [runtime security](docs/current/phase-5-runtime-security.md).
- `docker\gateway.ps1 -Rebuild` — rebuild and recreate the persistent Windows-hosted
  Feishu Gateway while preserving its schema-scoped data and Project volumes.

`better-sqlite3` is unavailable in the local Windows environment. Run SQLite and
POSIX-path tests in Docker:

```text
docker build -f Dockerfile.test -t metaclaw-test .
docker run --rm metaclaw-test
```

Do not repeatedly retry the full suite on Windows; `npm run lint` is the reliable
host check. Core policy, execution, or storage changes require focused tests at
the owning seam.

For the AnyFusion-Pi integration, local Docker validation covers both repositories in one Node 22.19+ runtime image, their isolated dependency trees and processes, the Unix socket bridge, stdin/stdout Planner RPC, Session-to-Kernel handoff, and unchanged core regressions. The Pi fork uses `npm run build:offline` through the required `anyfusion-pi` BuildKit context; do not add a prebuilt Planner-image fallback, embed a second Node runtime, use a host-global Pi install, or run Planner code inside the MetaClaw process.

Native Ubuntu and the Ubuntu Runtime image share `scripts/runtime-bootstrap.sh`.
Host defaults are `~/.config/anyfusion` plus
`~/.local/share/anyfusion/runtime`; container defaults are
`/data/anyfusion/config` plus `/data/anyfusion/runtime`, with Project
`/workspace/default`. Keep packaging wrappers thin and do not reintroduce a
second startup/configuration path.

On Linux servers, `anyfusion` is the canonical startup path. Runtime and
AnyFusion-Pi are separate host Node.js processes, canonical Executors reuse the
installed `codex` and `pi` commands, and attempts use isolated homes plus
managed Git worktrees. Docker is retained for CI, cross-platform deployment,
and the Windows-hosted Ubuntu development Runtime.
Gateway service mode is `anyfusion gateway run` in the foreground. Do not add a
repository-owned PID/log wrapper or generated systemd launcher; use the server's
existing process supervisor when background operation is required.

## Code, Plans, And Commits

Use strict TypeScript and ESM imports, two-space indentation, single quotes,
semicolons, and kebab-case filenames. Keep Ink/React in `.tsx` and non-UI logic
in `.ts`.

Material plans belong in `docs/plans/`; record status and plan date, then add the
completion date, delivered behavior, validation, and closing commit before
reporting completion. See [`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md).

Use Conventional Commit subjects (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `test:`,
`refactor:`). Do not commit credentials, Feishu secrets, generated databases,
local workspace state, or `dist/` unless explicitly required.
