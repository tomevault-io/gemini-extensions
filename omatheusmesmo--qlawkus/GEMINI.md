# Qlawkus - Agent Instructions

## Dev Mode Start

```bash
mvn install -pl client -am -DskipTests   # must run first; client/ is a Quarkus extension
mvn -pl app -am quarkus:dev              # from the root: app/ is the only runnable module, and
                                         # capability resolution needs the reactor (see below)
```

Changing `client/` requires re-running `mvn install -pl client -am` then restarting dev mode. Hot reload does NOT apply to extension code.

## Containerized Run

`./run.sh <local|prod|native> [up|build|down|logs|restart|ps]` wraps Docker Compose (`./run.sh --help` for the full list). Unlike dev mode, this needs only Docker: the `app/src/main/docker/Dockerfile.{jvm,native}-build` images are **multi-stage** and compile the whole reactor in-container (build stage = the `ubi9/openjdk-25` builder, which ships Maven; runtime = `ubi9/openjdk-25-runtime`), so there is no host `mvn install` step and no stale-jar trap. Each build Dockerfile has its own `Dockerfile.*-build.dockerignore` so the standard Quarkus `.dockerignore` (for the COPY-target `Dockerfile.jvm`/`.native-micro`) stays intact. The build runs the **full** reactor (`mvn install`), not `-pl app -am`: a fresh local repo needs every `*-deployment` module built so the `extension-descriptor` check on each extension resolves. `local` -> `docker-compose.local.yml`; `prod`/`native` -> `docker-compose.yml` (native via its `native` profile).

## Architecture

Multi-module Maven monorepo with a Quarkus extension pattern (`client/deployment` + `client/runtime`):

- **`composition-model/`** - Thin, **Quarkus-free** module (plain records + Jackson YAML) holding the `agent.yml` composition manifest model: `CompositionManifest`/`BuildTime`/`Posture`, the single `CompositionManifestParser`, the policy+exceptions `isEnabled` logic, and the path conventions (`CompositionPaths`). Shared by the (future) pom generator that reads `build-time` before the build and the running app that reads `runtime` each boot, so the schema and policy never drift (same single-source-of-truth discipline as `KeystoreSecrets`). The `qlawkus.composition.*` location config (`CompositionConfig`, BUILD_TIME) lives in `client`. At runtime `client` also exposes an authenticated composition control plane (`rest.CompositionAdminResource` + `compose.CompositionAdminService`): `POST /api/admin/composition/manifest` validates a new `agent.yml` (via the shared `CompositionManifestParser`) and stages it under `qlawkus.agent.state.root`; `GET /api/admin/composition` returns the active (baked, read from the classpath `agent.yml`) + staged pair; `DELETE .../manifest` discards it. It only records intent (validate + write), never builds - the seam to an external builder is HTTP, not a shared volume, so even a leaked admin credential can at most stage a validated manifest. The same admin surface generalizes to arbitrary config values via `config.metadata.ConfigMetadataIndex` (reads the `quarkus-config-doc` metadata bundled in every extension jar - the same source that generates `config-reference.adoc` - so the property list is never hand-maintained): `RUN_TIME` properties go through `config.RuntimeToggleWriter` + `PUT`/`DELETE /api/admin/runtime-toggles` (writes straight into the `runtime:` override file, applies on restart); `BUILD_TIME`/`BUILD_AND_RUN_TIME_FIXED` properties go through `compose.ConfigOverridesAdminService` + `PUT`/`POST`/`DELETE /api/admin/config-overrides`, staging a `.properties` document that is fetched and promoted into `config-overrides.properties` alongside `agent.yml` by the same redeploy loop - parallel files, never merged, so the pom generator never has to reconcile `application.properties` lines. `secrets.SecretPropertyCatalog` excludes known-secret property names from the index entirely, so a secret is never rendered or writable through either endpoint.
- **`composition-maven-plugin/`** - Maven plugin (`qlawkus-maven-plugin`, goal prefix `qlawkus`) that turns the manifest into the pom **before** the build (`mvn qlawkus:generate`). Quarkus resolves dependencies before augmentation and Maven does no tree-shaking, so a manifest can only decide the dependencies from a generator that runs ahead of the build, not a `@BuildStep`. `GenerateMojo` reads `agent.yml` (via `composition-model`), resolves the selected capabilities against a `CapabilityCatalog`, and reconciles the pom's `<dependencies>` in place via the Maven Model API - adding selected capabilities, removing deselected ones, preserving the rest (the skeleton). Idempotent. Added deps carry no version (BOM-managed, like `quarkus extension add`). **Quarkus-free** at runtime; needs an ASM>=9.8 override for the plugin descriptor on Java 25. The catalog (#74) is decentralized: each extension module self-describes its capability name in its own `quarkus-extension.yaml` under `metadata.qlawkus.capability`, and the default `ReactorCatalog` reads that key from every reactor module (`${reactorProjects}`), reading the source descriptor template so it works before any module is built. `CapabilityCatalog` stays an interface so a published-artifact strategy (external consumer, outside the monorepo) can be added without touching the generator. Capability names ship namespaced where natural (`messaging.discord`, `cognition.pgvector`) and several modules may share one (`google-workspace` = the 6 google modules); `qlawkus-client` is the always-present skeleton and declares none. Each run logs the **resolved capability set** (selected/excluded) so the policy-and-exceptions shorthand never hides the full state, and an `except` name no module declares **fails the build** (opt-out `-Dqlawkus.composition.fail-on-unknown-capability=false`) - the anti-typo guard, since an unannounced name otherwise silently resolves to nothing. The goal's default phase is `generate-sources`, wired as an `<execution>` in the app pom, so every Maven build reconciles the pom from `agent.yml` before Quarkus resolves dependencies. **It does not re-run inside a live `quarkus:dev` session**: dev mode notices the changed `agent.yml` and logs "Files changed but restart not needed" without re-entering `generate-sources`, so a manifest edit applies on the *next* build - restart dev mode, or run `mvn qlawkus:generate`. Capability resolution reads `${reactorProjects}`, so the generator needs the reactor visible (`mvn -pl app -am quarkus:dev` from the root, not a lone `cd app && mvn quarkus:dev`). End-to-end proof is the `maven-invoker` IT under `src/it/` (a real two-capability reactor + agent app), gated by the `composition-invoker-it` profile (off under `-Pnative`, honors `skipITs`); its post-build hooks are **BeanShell** (`.bsh`), not Groovy, because Groovy's shaded ASM cannot read Java 25 class files.
- **`client/`** - Quarkus extension (core agent, cognition, REST, tools). Not a runnable app. **Database-free**: depends on no datasource/JDBC/Flyway/pgvector - the markdown stores are its `@DefaultBean` backend.
- **`cognition-pgvector/`** - Optional Quarkus extension (`deployment/` + `runtime/`) holding the entire Postgres/pgvector backend for the cognition stores (the `store.pg` package, the 7 Flyway migrations, and the datasource/pgvector config as `META-INF/microprofile-config.properties`). Present in `app/`; absent in a markdown-only distribution. `requires` the `dev.omatheusmesmo.qlawkus.agent` capability.
- **`console/`** - Optional Quarkus extension (`deployment/` + `runtime/`, capability `console`) serving a server-rendered admin UI at `/console` (Qute + HTMX, no Node, `@Authenticated` reusing the app's Basic+Argon2id mechanism). Read views inject the `client` SPIs directly; every mutating action is driven from the page by HTMX against the existing `/api/admin/*` endpoints, never re-implemented in a console resource. Pages: the onboarding wizard (first-run setup), management (`/console/memory`, `/console/skills`, `/console/cognition`), the full configuration editor (`/console/config`, see the `composition-model/` bullet above), and the schedule page (`/console/schedule`, listing the 5 background jobs - memory review/curation, episodic consolidation, skill curation/lifecycle - with cron/last-run/next-run read from the live `io.quarkus.scheduler.Scheduler`, so they always match what is actually registered; each job carries an explicit `@Scheduled(identity = ...)` for this lookup. The job registry itself - label, cron property, trigger endpoint - is static in `ScheduleConsoleResource` by necessity: no framework metadata links a job to the config property holding its cron, so it cannot be derived from `ConfigMetadataIndex`). Cron is `RUN_TIME` like every other scheduler property, so editing it reuses the same `/api/admin/runtime-toggles` endpoint the config editor uses (applies on next restart, not live - `@Scheduled` resolves its cron property expression once at boot); triggering a job now hits its existing `/api/admin/*` endpoint, including a new `POST /api/admin/memory/consolidate` added alongside `/review` and `/curate` so all 5 jobs are triggerable uniformly. `console/deployment`'s `ConsoleProcessor` registers the runtime's `@Path` resources via `AdditionalBeanBuildItem` since the jar is not an implicit CDI bean archive on its own.
- **`app/`** - Deployable Quarkus app (`packaging=quarkus`) and the **reference/example distribution**: one worked example of how to assemble Qlawkus, so it holds **only wiring and configuration** (pom + `application.properties` + `src/main/docker`) and **never implementation code** (no `src/main/java`). Anything an integrator would want to reuse belongs in an extension (`client` or a `*/` module), so other distributions can pick it up; `app/` just composes and configures it. Wires all extensions together; the only module you run.
- **`tools/`** - Optional tool extensions (Google Workspace 6 modules + Brag + Skill Hub). Each is a standalone Quarkus extension with `deployment/` + `runtime/`. `qlawkus-tools-skill-hub` is the remote skill-registry client (search/install from skills.sh); it `requires` the `dev.omatheusmesmo.qlawkus.agent` capability and is the outward-facing counterpart to the in-`client` local skill subsystem.
- **`messaging/`** - Messaging extension (core + Discord/Telegram/Slack/WhatsApp adapters). Same `deployment/` + `runtime/` pattern.
- **`integration-tests/`** - Per-feature integration test modules (smoke, cognition, markdown-only, google, terminal, brag, code-review, messaging). Each is a standalone Quarkus app (`packaging=quarkus`). `markdown-only` is the proof of the database-free distribution (boots with no datasource); `cognition` depends on `cognition-pgvector` to exercise the Postgres path.
- **`testing-internal/`** - Shared test utilities (depends on `qlawkus-client`).

`app/` depends on `client`, `cognition-pgvector`, all `tools/*`, and `messaging` (core + discord + telegram). Slack and WhatsApp adapters are built but not in `app/` pom.

## Cognition & Memory

The memory subsystem (`client/runtime/.../cognition` + `.../store`) is the core of the agent. Its guiding principle: **relevant memory is injected into the prompt automatically each turn, so recall never depends on the model remembering to search** - and the stores stay fully searchable on demand (RAG feeds the automatic injection; the `session_search` tool lets the model deliberately query transcripts). Automatic injection is the reliable default; tool-based search is available on top. Understanding it means reading several files together:

Three layers, all injected each turn via `SoulEngine` (the agent's `systemMessageProviderSupplier`) and the retrieval augmentor:

- **Persona** - `Soul` (a plain singleton domain object) rendered into the system message by `SoulEngine`. Persisted behind the `SoulStore` SPI, backend selected by the same `qlawkus.cognition.backend` switch: `store.markdown.MarkdownSoulStore` (`@DefaultBean`, a `soul.md` file seeded from `META-INF/qlawkus/default-soul.md`, no DB), `store.pg.PgSoulStore` (the `soul` table via `SoulEntity`), `store.pg.HybridSoulStore` (reuses pg).
- **Owner** - `UserProfile` (a plain singleton domain object; the single user this agent serves) injected every turn by `SoulEngine`. Maintained by `UpdateUserProfileTool`, refreshed by `MemoryCurationJob`. Persisted behind the `UserProfileStore` SPI: `MarkdownUserProfileStore` (`@DefaultBean`, an `owner.md` file), `PgUserProfileStore` (the `user_profile` table via `UserProfileEntity`), `HybridUserProfileStore`. Roots for the markdown soul/profile files: `qlawkus.agent.state.root` (default `~/.qlawkus/state`).
- **Facts** - `FactStore` SPI, backend selected at **build time** via `@IfBuildProperty` on `qlawkus.cognition.backend` (`markdown` | `pgvector` | `hybrid`): `store.markdown.MarkdownFactStore` (`@DefaultBean`; `.md` files + in-process `InMemoryEmbeddingStore` with a JSON embedding cache, no DB; shared file logic in `MarkdownFactFiles`), `store.pg.PgFactStore` (pgvector; `@IfBuildProperty pgvector enableIfMissing`, only present when the `cognition-pgvector` extension is on the classpath), `store.pg.HybridFactStore` (files source-of-truth + pg mirror). Root: `qlawkus.agent.facts.root` (default `~/.qlawkus/facts`). The markdown stores are `@DefaultBean` across the module split, so they win whenever the pgvector extension is absent (database-free) and the non-default pg/hybrid beans override them when it is present - regardless of the `backend` value. Every embedding is tagged with a `MemorySource` (`remember-tool`, `semantic-extractor`, `episodic-consolidator`, `transcript`) - the enum exists so producers and purges never drift. **Facts are chunked before embedding** (`store.FactChunker`, char-budget `qlawkus.agent.facts.chunk-*`, default ~1200 chars ≈ 400 tokens): a fact over the embedding model's token limit (512 for `nv-embedqa-e5-v5`) is split into overlapping segments, so one fact becomes N vector rows sharing a parent `factHash` (in metadata; segment 0 also carries the whole `factText` for pg→files reconstruction). Identity/dedup is the `factHash`, not the row text - the pg `embeddings.content_hash` is generated from `metadata->>'factHash'` (not unique, since N segments share it), so `existsByContentHash` dedups at fact granularity. Without this, an oversized fact fails to embed: in `hybrid` the `.md` is written before the embed, so it orphans file-only and `CognitionReconciler.reconcileFacts` aborts the whole 6-store union every boot (the reconcile now also try/catches per fact, so one bad fact never aborts the union).

Stores & retrieval:

- **Active Memory** - `ActiveMemoryAugmentor` is the AiService `retrievalAugmentor`; it runs an `EmbeddingStoreContentRetriever` before each reply and injects query-relevant facts. It filters OUT `source=transcript` so curated facts stay clean.
- **Working memory** - `WorkingMemoryStore` SPI (also a langchain4j `ChatMemoryStore`), windowed to 40 messages. `updateMessages` is append-only (preserves `createdAt`; never reset it) and fires `MessagesAppendedEvent` for every new message on any channel. Backends: `store.markdown.MarkdownWorkingMemoryStore` (`@DefaultBean`, one append-only `<memoryId>.jsonl` per conversation under `qlawkus.agent.working-memory.root`, default `~/.qlawkus/working-memory`), `store.pg.PgWorkingMemoryStore` (the `chat_message_entity` table), `store.pg.HybridWorkingMemoryStore` (reuses pg - the rolling chat log is transient, not file-versioned). The markdown store is the `@DefaultBean`; because upstream ships a `@DefaultBean InMemoryChatMemoryStore`, `ClientProcessor` vetoes it (`ExcludedTypeBuildItem`) so there is a single default and the non-default pg/hybrid beans still override when the pgvector extension is present.
- **Transcripts (session_search)** - `TranscriptArchiveObserver` embeds each message as `source=transcript`; `SearchTranscriptsTool` searches only those.
- **Episodic** - `EpisodicConsolidatorJob` (nightly) summarizes each day into journals (also embedded through the `FactStore` as `source=episodic-consolidator`). The journal record is an `EpisodicStore` SPI, backend selected at build time by the same `qlawkus.cognition.backend`: `store.markdown.MarkdownEpisodicStore` (`@DefaultBean`; dated `<date>.md` files, one per day, no DB; file logic in `MarkdownEpisodicFiles`), `store.pg.PgEpisodicStore` (the `Journal` table), `store.pg.HybridEpisodicStore` (files source-of-truth + pg mirror). Pg/hybrid share Panache access via `JournalRepository` and live in the `cognition-pgvector` extension. Root: `qlawkus.agent.episodic.root` (default `~/.qlawkus/journals`).

Scheduled background jobs, each with a manual `POST /api/admin/memory/*` trigger:

- `MemoryReviewJob` - semantic dedup of near-duplicate facts (`/review`).
- `MemoryCurationJob` - folds facts into the owner profile, reconciling contradictions; leaves facts untouched (`/curate`).
- `SemanticExtractorObserver` - extracts facts from a conversation on `ChatCompletedEvent`. The event is emitted channel-agnostically by `ChatCompletionEmitter`, which observes the store-level `MessagesAppendedEvent` and fires once per turn (when a final assistant message - one without tool-execution requests - is appended). **Passive fact extraction works on every channel** (REST, Discord, Telegram); gate it with `qlawkus.agent.semantic-extractor.enabled` (default `true`). The same event also drives the Brag `AchievementProcessor`, so both run on all channels.

Config knobs: `qlawkus.agent.memory.*`, `qlawkus.agent.active-memory.*`, `qlawkus.agent.transcript-*`, `qlawkus.agent.semantic-extractor.*`, `qlawkus.memory-review.*`, `qlawkus.memory-curation.*`. Admin REST: `GET/DELETE /api/admin/memory` (summary / purge), `POST /api/admin/memory/{review,curate}`. End-to-end check: `scripts/memory-benchmark.sh` (needs a running instance + real LLM).

Gotcha when testing recall: working memory and the system prompt are both sources, so to prove a fact came from the vector store, `TRUNCATE chat_message_entity` first. The embedding model (`nvidia/nv-embedqa-e5-v5`) is retrieval-tuned and scores relevant pairs high, so a cosine `min-score` of 0.9 is not as strict as it looks - `0.7` is the default margin.

## Skills (procedural memory)

Skills are the agent's **procedural** memory (how to do a recurring task), complementing the declarative memory above. Each skill is a `SKILL.md` file (YAML frontmatter `name` + `description` + Markdown body). Same discipline as memory: the index is **injected, not searched** - `SoulEngine` adds a `## Skills` block (name + description only, via `SkillIndexRenderer`, capped by `qlawkus.skills.max-injected`) every turn; the full body is loaded on demand with the `viewSkill` tool (progressive disclosure).

- **SPI**: `skill.SkillStore` (interface) with `Skill`/`SkillSummary` records. SKILL.md **parsing is delegated to the upstream `dev.langchain4j.skills` loaders** (`FileSystemSkillLoader`, agentskills.io spec, BOM-managed `dev.langchain4j:langchain4j-skills`); `SkillFrontmatter` owns only the **write** side (rendering a `Skill` back to frontmatter + body), which upstream does not provide. The backend is selected at **build time** via `@IfBuildProperty` on `qlawkus.cognition.backend` (`markdown` | `pgvector` | `hybrid`): `MarkdownSkillStore` (`@DefaultBean`, no DB, shared file logic in `MarkdownSkillFiles`), `store.pg.PgSkillStore` (the `skill` table, `V6` migration), `store.pg.HybridSkillStore` (files source-of-truth + pg mirror). Reads from all `qlawkus.skills.roots` (first wins); writes only to the first, owned root (default `~/.qlawkus/skills`).
- **Tools** (in `AgentService`): `ViewSkillTool` (load body), `ManageSkillTool` (`createOrUpdateSkill` / `deleteSkill`).
- **Auto-distill**: `SkillExtractorObserver` mines a reusable skill from each `ChatCompletedEvent` (gate `qlawkus.skills.extractor.enabled`), mirroring `SemanticExtractorObserver`.
- **Curation**: `SkillCurationJob` removes redundant skills (scheduled + `POST /api/admin/skills/curate`).
- **Lifecycle**: `viewSkill` calls `recordUse`; `SkillLifecycleJob` ages unused skills `ACTIVE -> STALE -> ARCHIVED` (config `qlawkus.skills.lifecycle.*`, scheduled + `POST /api/admin/skills/lifecycle`). Archived skills leave the injected index but stay loadable; pinned skills (`POST /api/admin/skills/{name}/pin`) never transition. Telemetry: pg columns (migration `V7`) for pgvector/hybrid, a `.qlawkus-usage.json` sidecar for markdown.
- **Admin REST**: `GET/DELETE /api/admin/skills`, `GET /api/admin/skills/{name}`, `POST /api/admin/skills/{curate,lifecycle}`, `POST /api/admin/skills/{name}/pin`.
- **Bundled skills (build-time)**: extensions/apps ship read-only skills as classpath resources under `META-INF/qlawkus-skills/<name>/SKILL.md`. `ClientProcessor.bundledSkills` (a `@BuildStep` + `SkillsRecorder`) scans and parses them (via the same `FileSystemSkillLoader`) at **augmentation** and bakes them into the synthetic `BundledSkills` bean - no runtime classpath scanning. Stores merge bundled (read-only) with owned skills; owned wins on a name clash. The bundling **machinery** lives in `client`; curated default skill **content** is a distribution concern and should ship from `app`, not `client`.
- **Remote registry (Skill Hub)**: everything above is **local** (read/write SKILL.md files, offline). The **outward-facing** registry client lives in the optional `qlawkus-tools-skill-hub` extension (package `tools.skillhub`), kept out of `client` so a locked-down distribution can omit the network capability at the module level (not just a config flag). SPI `SkillHub { search(query, limit); install(source); publish(skill) }`, default impl `HttpSkillHub` (`@DefaultBean`; plain `java.net.http` + Jackson, **no external CLI** - jskills/skills.sh both need extra tooling installed, so the behavior is replicated natively instead). Tools `searchSkillHub`/`installSkill`/`publishSkill` are `@QlawTool` (discovered cross-module by `ClientProcessor`'s `@QlawTool` scan). Config root `qlawkus.skill-hub.*`.
  - **Search**: hits `<base-url>/api/search` plus, for each `well-known-hosts` entry, the `/.well-known/agent-skills/index.json` index (agentskills.io standard, fallback to legacy `/.well-known/skills/`). Best-effort across sources, deduped by source, capped by `max-results`.
  - **Install**: resolves an `owner/repo` slug to the raw GitHub SKILL.md (tries `main`/`master`) or takes a direct URL (well-known hits are direct URLs), validates the name against path traversal, saves via `SkillStore` into the owned root - so it enters the injected index next turn. Only the SKILL.md text is fetched; executable assets are never pulled or run (inert by omission).
  - **Publish**: `publishSkill` renders an owned skill to `<publish.dir>/<name>/SKILL.md` (reusing `SkillFrontmatter.render`, now `public`). It **never runs git** - in a container, mount `publish.dir` to a host git working copy and the owner pushes from the host (keeps credentials out of the container and honors the manual-push rule). Opt-in via `publish.enabled` (default false).
  - **Approval**: install and publish honor `qlawkus.skill-hub.approval-mode` (`yolo` acts immediately; `hitl` previews and requires a confirmed re-call).

Config knobs: `qlawkus.cognition.backend`, `qlawkus.skills.*`, `qlawkus.skill-hub.*`. Facts, episodic journals, skills, working memory, the persona (`Soul`) and the owner profile (`UserProfile`) are all pluggable on this same switch, and the entire Postgres backend now lives in the optional `cognition-pgvector` extension - so a build without it is database-free (validated by `integration-tests/markdown-only`). The remote-registry side of skills is the optional `qlawkus-tools-skill-hub` extension (above).

Backend migration (in `cognition-pgvector`, so only in pgvector/hybrid builds): `store.pg.reconcile.CognitionReconciler` does a bidirectional, idempotent **union** of files <-> pgvector across all six stores (collections keyed by content hash/date/name/conversation id; singletons filled only when one side is empty, never clobbered). It runs once at hybrid boot via `HybridReconcileStartup` (gate `qlawkus.cognition.reconcile-at-start`, default `true`) and on `POST /api/admin/cognition/reconcile`. `CognitionMigrator` (`POST /api/admin/cognition/migrate?direction=files-to-pg|pg-to-files`) is the explicit one-directional copy that **does** overwrite the destination singletons. This is a Qlawkus capability, not an upstream langchain4j one - it's only possible because every store keeps a parallel markdown representation as the bridge. Covered by `CognitionReconcileTest`.

## Testing

```bash
# Single test class (-am builds upstream modules; the failIfNoSpecifiedTests flag
# stops sibling modules in the reactor from erroring when the class isn't theirs)
mvn test -pl client/deployment -am -Dtest=UserProfileTest -Dsurefire.failIfNoSpecifiedTests=false

# Unit tests for a single module (uses WireMock, no LLM needed)
mvn test -pl client/deployment

# Integration tests (LLM-dependent tests auto-skip if no API key)
mvn test -pl integration-tests/smoke

# Integration tests with real LLM (requires NVIDIA_AI_API_KEY env var)
NVIDIA_AI_API_KEY=your-key mvn test -pl integration-tests/smoke

# Full build (skip ITs by default - skipITs=true in parent pom)
mvn verify

# Native ITs (enable with -Pnative)
mvn verify -Pnative

# Composition maven-invoker IT (real reactor + qlawkus:generate). Needs qlawkus-composition-model
# in the local repo, so install first; off by default (skipITs) and under -Pnative.
mvn -pl composition-model install -DskipTests
mvn -pl composition-maven-plugin install -DskipTests -DskipITs=false
```

- `client/deployment/src/test/` - Extension build-time tests with WireMock-mocked LLM
- `integration-tests/*/src/test/` - QuarkusTest integration tests; some call real LLMs, some use `@InjectMock`
- LLM-dependent tests use `@EnabledIf("dev.omatheusmesmo.qlawkus.testing.QlawkusTestUtils#usesLLM")` - auto-skip when `NVIDIA_AI_API_KEY` is absent or "dummy"
- Smoke tests (`integration-tests/smoke/`) hit real LLM: can take 5+ minutes per test

## Adding Tools

Create a CDI bean annotated with `@QlawTool` + `@ApplicationScoped`. Methods annotated with `@Tool` are auto-discovered at build time by `ClientProcessor` (which also registers DTO records in `dev.omatheusmesmo.qlawkus.dto` for reflection). No manual registration needed.

New tool modules must also be added as dependencies in `app/pom.xml`.

## Extension Development

Every module here (`client`, `tools/*`, `messaging/*`) is a full Quarkus extension: a `runtime/` + `deployment/` pair. Rules that keep that pattern correct:

- **Dependency direction is one-way.** `deployment/` depends on `runtime/` (plus other extensions' `*-deployment` artifacts); `runtime/` must NEVER depend on any `deployment` artifact. The Maven plugin validates this and fails the build if a required deployment dependency is missing.
- **Three bootstrap phases.** Build-time *augmentation* runs `@BuildStep` processors (e.g. `ClientProcessor`) - it reads the Jandex index, never loads app classes, and records bytecode. `@Record(STATIC_INIT)` bytecode runs in a static initializer (framework boot, bean wiring; do NOT open ports, start threads, or read runtime config here). `@Record(RUNTIME_INIT)` bytecode runs in `main` (ports, runtime config, service start). Push work to STATIC_INIT when possible.
- **Build steps talk via build items, not fields.** A build-step class is instantiated per invocation and discarded; share state only through immutable `*BuildItem`s. Always produce a `FeatureBuildItem`. A step runs only if something consumes what it produces.
- **Recorders bridge build to runtime.** `@Recorder` methods in `runtime/` are *recorded* (not executed) at build time; their calls replay at runtime. Parameters must be bytecode-serializable (primitives, strings, config objects, `RuntimeValue<T>`). Wrap complex objects in `RuntimeValue<T>`.
- **Config is `@ConfigMapping` interfaces.** `@ConfigRoot(phase = RUN_TIME)` + `@ConfigMapping(prefix = "qlawkus...")`, JavaDoc on each accessor (it becomes the generated config-reference description), `@WithDefault` for defaults, `Optional<T>` for optional, `Map<String, X>` for keyed/dynamic config (see `MessagingConfig`). Choose phase by need: `BUILD_TIME` (build only), `BUILD_AND_RUN_TIME_FIXED` (read at build, immutable at runtime), `RUN_TIME` (re-read each run, overridable).
- **CDI registration.** Register extension beans with `AdditionalBeanBuildItem`; use `@DefaultBean` for anything app code should be able to override; `SyntheticBeanBuildItem` for beans built through a recorder.
- **Native image.** Reflection needs registration - `ClientProcessor` already registers `dev.omatheusmesmo.qlawkus.dto` records via `ReflectiveClassBuildItem`; new reflective types (DTOs, models) must be added the same way (or `@RegisterForReflection`). Use `NativeImageResourceBuildItem` to bundle resources. Verify with `mvn verify -Pnative`.
- **A new optional extension must declare its composition capability.** Add `metadata.qlawkus.capability` to the module's `src/main/resources/META-INF/quarkus-extension.yaml` (create the source template if the module only relied on the generated one). That single key is what the `qlawkus-maven-plugin` `ReactorCatalog` maps to the module's coordinates, so the `agent.yml` manifest can compose the extension in or out. A module with no key is treated as always-present skeleton and is never toggled - so forgetting it means the capability silently cannot be selected. Name capabilities namespaced where natural (`messaging.discord`, `cognition.pgvector`); several modules may share one name to move as a unit (`google-workspace`). Keeping it in `quarkus-extension.yaml` (not the pom) is deliberate: that metadata rides into a published Quarkus platform catalog, so the same key serves both the in-repo `ReactorCatalog` and a future published-artifact catalog for consumers building from `agent.yml` without cloning.
- **Before inventing a build item, check the catalog**: [all build items](https://quarkus.io/guides/all-builditems).

## Secrets

Database-free secret store, owned by `client` (no separate module, no custom crypto). Secrets live in a PKCS12 keystore named by the convention `qlawkus.secrets.keystore-path` (default `~/.qlawkus/secrets.p12`), unlocked by `qlawkus.secrets.keystore-password`. The built-in SmallRye keystore source is fixed at ordinal 100 (below env) with no knob to raise it, so `client` ships its own `secrets.KeystoreSecretConfigSourceFactory` (a `ConfigSourceFactory` registered via `META-INF/services`) that reads the keystore with the plain JDK `KeyStore` API (`getKey().getEncoded()` as UTF-8 - exactly how `keytool -importpass` stores it) and republishes every entry at `qlawkus.secrets.keystore-ordinal` (default 350). Knobs are documented by `SecretsConfig` (`@ConfigMapping(prefix="qlawkus.secrets")`), rendered into the config reference under "Secrets".

- **Alias = property name.** Each keystore alias is the config property it supplies; consumers read a plain `@ConfigProperty` (no code change). Onboard with `keytool -importpass -alias '<config.property.name>' -keystore <path> -storetype PKCS12`.
- **Write side (no keytool).** `secrets.KeystoreSecretWriter` (`@ApplicationScoped`) onboards a secret programmatically via the JDK `KeyStore` API, creating the file on first write and storing entries identically to `keytool -importpass` (PBE `SecretKeyEntry`). The read/write PKCS12 convention is centralized in `secrets.KeystoreSecrets` (the `ConfigSourceFactory` now delegates its read to it, so reader and writer can't drift). REST surface `rest.SecretsAdminResource` (`@Authenticated`, `/api/admin/secrets`): `PUT` (body `{alias,value}`, never logs the value), `GET` (alias names only), `DELETE ?alias=`. A missing `keystore-password` returns `409` (won't create an unprotected store); a written secret takes effect on next boot. Covered by `markdown-only` `SecretWriteEndpointTest` (the read-back asserts keytool-compatibility) + `SecretWriteNoPasswordTest` (the 409 guard).
- **Auth is fail-closed and pluggable.** `app/` drops the old `${API_USER_PASSWORD:qlawkus}` fallback - the bundled distro refuses to boot without a real credential (env, or the matching keystore alias); `%dev` keeps a known password for local dev only. Auth mechanism is the integrator's choice via standard Quarkus security: endpoints use `@Authenticated`, so adding `quarkus-oidc` / `quarkus-smallrye-jwt` to the consuming app swaps the mechanism with zero Qlawkus code (no custom auth extension - that would reinvent `quarkus-oidc`).
- **Authoritative precedence.** Published at ordinal 350: `sysprops (400) > keystore (350) > env (300) > .env (295) > application.properties (250)`. A stored secret wins over the matching env var, so the rule is "drop it in the keystore and it takes effect" with no stray env default able to shadow it; only `-D` system properties still override. Lower `qlawkus.secrets.keystore-ordinal` below 300 to let env override instead. Validated by `integration-tests/markdown-only` `KeystoreSecretTest` (`keystoreSecretOutranksApplicationProperties` + the absent-keystore leniency contract), which boots with no datasource.
- **Lenient.** Resolves the keystore on the filesystem then the classpath; absent file contributes nothing, so a fresh install boots on `.env` and the feature stays inert until a keystore exists.
- **Migrating consumers.** No consumer change is needed: the alias is the property the consumer already reads, and the keystore (350) outranks the `application.properties` `=${ENV:}` line (250). The catalog of secret properties lives in `site/content/secrets.adoc` ("What to store"). The one non-obvious case is the LLM/embedding key: `model.LlmKindConfigSourceFactory` runs at ordinal 90 and reads `quarkus.langchain4j.openai."primary".api-key` / `LLM_API_KEY` back from the context (it only honours sources out-ranking 90), so a keystore-stored key flows through it unchanged. `KeystoreSecretTest.llmApiKeyResolvesFromKeystoreThroughKindFactory` pins this end to end (the value reaches the real OpenAI client's Authorization header).
- **Container.** Mount the keystore path on a persistent volume; pass `QLAWKUS_SECRETS_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` via env. File and password stay out of the image.
- **Managed alternative.** `quarkus-vault` on the classpath contributes a `CredentialsProvider` and resolves secrets the same way (ordinary config); use it when secrets are managed centrally.
- **Gotcha.** The `.p12` test fixture is a real PKCS12 keystore. The global `pre-commit` hook strips trailing whitespace on non-blacklisted files and will corrupt it (DER `EOFException` at boot); commit keystore binaries with `git commit --no-verify`.

User-facing guide: `site/content/secrets.adoc`.

## Databases

Up to 3 PostgreSQL databases, all managed by Flyway:
- **`qlawkus`** (default) - Main: persona, owner profile, chat history, episodic journal, pgvector embeddings. **Only present when the `cognition-pgvector` extension is on the classpath** (it owns the default datasource, the 7 `V1..V7` migrations, and the pgvector config, contributed via its `META-INF/microprofile-config.properties`). A markdown-only build has no default datasource and never connects to Postgres.
- **`qlawkus_google_auth`** - OAuth credentials + state (Google tools extension)
- **`qlawkus_brag`** - Career brag documents (Brag tool extension; its own named `brag` datasource, independent of cognition)

In Docker, `docker/postgres-init/01-create-databases.sql` creates the extra DBs. In dev mode, Flyway `clean-at-start` resets schema on every restart.

## Documentation

One source, one generated mirror. **Edit only `site/content/`** - everything else is built from it.

- **`site/content/*.adoc`** - hand-written pages (the Roq site): `index`, `architecture`, `config-reference`, `quickstart`, `messaging`, `voice`, `google-workspace`. This is the source of truth.
- **`site/content/includes/*.adoc`** - **generated** config reference. `docs/pom.xml` runs `quarkus-config-doc-maven-plugin` (build-time augmentation, no datasource, depends on every `*-deployment` artifact) which writes one file per config root from the `@ConfigMapping` JavaDoc into `site/content/includes/`. Never edit these by hand - they are overwritten every build.
- **`docs/modules/ROOT/pages/*`** - the Antora copy. The `sync-site-to-antora` execution in `docs/pom.xml` (`maven-resources-plugin`, `verify` phase) copies all of `site/content/` here. It is a generated mirror; **never edit `docs/` directly** (the next build overwrites it). If you must commit the mirror without a full build, copy the changed file from `site/content/` to the matching `docs/modules/ROOT/pages/` path.

Regenerate after a config change:

```bash
mvn install -DskipTests                  # build extensions so config metadata is available
mvn -f docs/pom.xml verify -DskipTests   # generate includes/ into site/, then mirror site/ -> docs/
```

**`config-reference.adoc` is hand-written**, not generated. It surfaces each generated table with an `include::` directive. A `@ConfigMapping(prefix = "qlawkus.foo")` interface produces `qlawkus-client_qlawkus.foo.adoc`; the aggregate `qlawkus-client.adoc` holds **only** the `quarkus.*`-rooted properties. So **adding a new `qlawkus.*` config root requires adding a matching `include::includes/qlawkus-client_qlawkus.foo.adoc[]` line** under "Core agent" in `config-reference.adoc`, in **both** trees, or the new properties never render. (This is exactly how the entire `qlawkus.*` surface was silently dropped after the `@ConfigMapping` migration.)

## LLM Configuration

Two named model configs via `@ModelName`, both provider-agnostic:
- **`primary`** - Primary model (any OpenAI-compatible provider; default endpoint: NVIDIA NIM). Pointed via the neutral `LLM_*` env vars (`LLM_BASE_URL`, `LLM_API_KEY`, `LLM_CHAT_MODEL`, `LLM_EMBEDDING_MODEL`, `LLM_TIMEOUT`).
- **`fallback`** - Fallback (Ollama, used when primary fails after retries + circuit breaker).

Dev mode: Dev Services auto-provisions Ollama (no `.env` needed).
Prod: Requires `LLM_API_KEY` in `.env`.

Embedding dimension is hardcoded to 1024 via `EMBEDDING_DIMENSION` - must match the model output.

### Dependency versions (do NOT conflate the two langchain4j namespaces)

| What | Version | Where set |
|------|---------|-----------|
| Quarkus platform | `3.37.4` | `quarkus.platform.version` in root `pom.xml` |
| quarkus-langchain4j (Quarkiverse extension) | `1.11.2` | `io.quarkus.platform:quarkus-langchain4j-bom` - do not set |
| Upstream `dev.langchain4j` core (transitive) | `1.16.2` | same BOM - do not set |
| Upstream beta modules (`langchain4j-skills`, `langchain4j-pgvector`, `langchain4j-agentic`) | `1.16.2-beta26` | same BOM - do not set |

The Quarkiverse **extension** version (`1.11.2`) and the upstream **library** version (`1.16.2`) are different namespaces: `1.11.2` is NOT a langchain4j-core version. The `quarkus-bom` manages neither, so the root pom imports `quarkus-langchain4j-bom` at the platform version; it pins the Quarkiverse artifacts and transitively imports the `langchain4j-bom`, which pins every `dev.langchain4j:*` artifact. So when adding an upstream module (e.g. `langchain4j-skills`, or `dev.langchain4j:langchain4j` for `InMemoryEmbeddingStore`), add it with **no `<version>`** - the BOM resolves it.

To move ahead of the platform's cadence, import `io.quarkiverse.langchain4j:quarkus-langchain4j-bom` at the wanted version *before* the platform one; declaration order decides which wins. Re-verify any time with:

```bash
mvn dependency:tree -pl client/runtime -Dincludes='dev.langchain4j'
```

## Key Entry Points

- `client/runtime/.../agent/AgentService.java` - `@RegisterAiService` interface (ReAct agent, `maxSequentialToolInvocations=100`); wires `systemMessageProviderSupplier`, `retrievalAugmentor` (Active Memory), tools, and `toolProviderSupplier`
- `client/runtime/.../rest/ApiResource.java` - `POST /api/chat` (SSE) and `POST /api/chat/sync`
- `client/runtime/.../cognition/SoulEngine.java` - Builds the dynamic system prompt: `Soul` persona + `UserProfile` owner block + execution-bias section, injected every turn
- `client/runtime/.../deployment/ClientProcessor.java` - Build step: discovers `@QlawTool` beans + DTOs for reflection

## CI / Release

6 GitHub Actions workflows:

- **`build-pull-request.yml`** - On PR: quick build → JVM test matrix (per module) → native IT matrix (per IT module) → build report. No API key passed → LLM tests auto-skip
- **`build-push.yml`** - On push to main: full `mvn clean install` with `NVIDIA_AI_API_KEY` → all tests run
- **`build-nightly.yml`** - Cron seg-sex 02:00 UTC + dispatch: JVM + native build with `NVIDIA_AI_API_KEY` → all tests run
- **`pre-release.yml`** - On PR that changes `.github/project.yml`: validates version is not SNAPSHOT, blocks forks
- **`release-prepare.yml`** - On PR merge that changes `.github/project.yml`: sets POM version, tags (no `v` prefix), pushes tag, bumps to next SNAPSHOT
- **`release-perform.yml`** - On tag push: builds artifacts, creates draft GitHub Release with PR-based changelog

Release flow: edit `current-version` in `.github/project.yml` → open PR (triggers `pre-release` validation) → merge triggers `release-prepare` → tag push triggers `release-perform` → edit/publish draft release.

Tags have no `v` prefix (e.g. `0.7.2`, not `v0.7.2`). Dependabot enabled for GitHub Actions + Maven dependencies (daily, ignores `io.quarkus:*`).

## Gotchas

- `client/` Dev Services for LLM are **disabled** in `client/runtime/application.properties` (`quarkus.langchain4j.devservices.enabled=false`) - they're enabled only in `app/` via profile overrides
- `app/` dev profile sets `flyway.clean-at-start=true` on all datasources: all data is wiped on every `quarkus:dev` restart
- Prod Docker exposes port **8742** (not 8080) for Google OAuth redirect URI compatibility
- `@Logged` on `AgentService` is an interceptor that logs agent interactions
- `SoulEngine` default timezone is `America/Sao_Paulo`
- `pty4j` + JNA are direct dependencies in `client/runtime` for interactive shell tool support
