# Anthropic API Manifold Pipe — agent notes

## Scope

This repo holds one OpenWebUI manifold pipe for the Anthropic Messages API plus its companion/toggle filters. Tasks usually touch model discovery, request payload assembly, the tool loop, content-block streaming, prompt caching, Files API / code execution / skills, or the toggle filters.

## Golden rule

`anthropic_pipe.py` and `anthropic_pipe.min.py` are **generated** (both committed). Edit `src/anthropic_pipe/**`, then rebuild. Hand-edits to the generated sections are lost on the next build.

## Build

| Need | Command (from repo root) |
|---|---|
| Compile the single-file artifact | `python helpers/build_anthropic_pipe.py` |
| Minify it standalone (the build already does this) | `python helpers/minify_pipe.py anthropic_pipe.py -o anthropic_pipe.min.py --check` |
| Pull the current artifact back into the template | `python helpers/build_anthropic_pipe.py --refresh-template` |
| Check model-list caching and invalidation | `python helpers/test_model_cache.py` (fakes the Anthropic client, no network) |
| Check API key encryption at rest | `python helpers/test_valve_encryption.py` (runs against the built artifact) |

`--refresh-template` overwrites `src/anthropic_pipe/pipe_template.py` with the current artifact minus its generated sections. Use it only when the template drifted, never as a normal step.

The build works by marker pairs (`# BEGIN/END GENERATED SECTION: anthropic_pipe.<section>`) inside the template. Marker **order in the template pins section order in the artifact** — a module must appear above any code that annotates against it, because the build strips `from __future__ import annotations`.

## File map

| Path | Role |
|---|---|
| `src/anthropic_pipe/pipe_template.py` | Template for the pipe module: docstring/frontmatter (title, version, requirements), `class Pipe`, valves, generated-section markers. Version bumps and changelog live here. |
| `src/anthropic_pipe/request/payload.py` | Payload assembly source of truth: messages, tools, betas, thinking, Files API, context management, cache-control inputs. Compiled into a module-level `create_request_payload()`. |
| `src/anthropic_pipe/request/{cache_control,messages,tools,files,rag}.py` | `Pipe` method groups for the request half of a turn. |
| `src/anthropic_pipe/response/*.py` | Response half: one module per Anthropic content-block family (`text_block`, `thinking_block`, `client_tool`, `server_tool`, `code_execution_results`, `web_tool_results`, `internal_tool_results`, `compaction_block`, `status_events`) plus `state`, `handlers`, `registry`, `runtime`, `formatting`. |
| `src/anthropic_pipe/shared/{models,tasks}.py` | Model discovery/capabilities and OpenWebUI task handling (title, tags, follow-ups, memory review). |
| `src/anthropic_pipe/pipe_orchestrator.py` | `Pipe.pipe()` request orchestration and the high-level tool loop. |
| `helpers/build_anthropic_pipe.py` | Compiles `src/` into `anthropic_pipe.py`. |
| `helpers/minify_pipe.py` | Strips comments/docstrings (keeps the module docstring OpenWebUI parses) for the upload artifact. |
| `anthropic_pipe.py` | Generated single-file OpenWebUI artifact (committed; this is what users install). |
| `anthropic_pipe.min.py` | Generated minified artifact. Committed too -- it is offered as an install source, so it must never lag behind `anthropic_pipe.py`. The build writes both. |
| `anthropic_manifold_companion_filter.py` | Routes OpenWebUI's built-in web_search / code_interpreter buttons to Anthropic-native tools. |
| `anthropic_pipe_{thinking,web_search,code_execution,files}_toggle.py` | One-shot toggle filters. |
| `README.md` | User-facing docs: install, valves, changelog. Keep the changelog in sync with the template docstring. |

Two module lists in `helpers/build_anthropic_pipe.py` are load-bearing:

- `STREAM_SOURCES` — module-level sections, compiled in list order.
- `METHOD_GROUP_SOURCES` — spliced into one `class Pipe` body. A duplicate method name in a later module **silently overrides** the earlier one.

## Architecture anchors

| Concern | Start with |
|---|---|
| Model list and capabilities | `shared/models.py` → `_parse_api_capabilities`, `get_model_info`, `get_anthropic_models`, `pipes` |
| Payload assembly | `request/payload.py` → `create_request_payload`, then `request/messages.py`, `request/tools.py` |
| File handling | `request/files.py` → `_get_pdf_base64_from_file_id`, `_process_files_api_data`, `_generate_file_download_link` |
| RAG cleanup | `request/rag.py` → `_extract_rag_from_system_message`, `_remove_rag_*` |
| Prompt caching | `request/cache_control.py` (breakpoint placement, TTL, cache diagnostics) |
| Main execution loop | `pipe_orchestrator.py` → `pipe`, `_process_tool_calls`, `_process_tool_results`, `_run_tool_callable` |
| Content-block streaming | `response/` — handlers are grouped by content type, not by Anthropic event type; `registry.py` wires them up |
| Skills / tasks | `shared/tasks.py`, `request/files.py` → `_validate_and_get_skills` |
| Formatting and persistence | `response/formatting.py`, `response/runtime.py` → `_format_thinking_block`, `_format_tool_result_block`, `_format_code_execution_block`, `_create_metadata_marker` |

## Invariants to preserve

- OpenWebUI persists the last emitted `chat:message`; full-message replacement matters more than the return value once streaming has started.
- Streamed text must have exactly one source of truth; duplicate bookkeeping causes doubled output.
- File flow priority is `Files API > native PDF upload > RAG fallback`.
- Metadata markers must accumulate forward — only the last assistant message survives into the next request.
- Cache breakpoints must stay stable across turns: anything appended per-request (memory, RAG, tool order) above a breakpoint invalidates the whole prefix. Tools are appended name-sorted for exactly this reason.
- Be careful with cache control around thinking blocks and programmatic tool-calling flows.
- Do not send empty location values for Anthropic web-search configuration.
- The model-list cache is class-level and must stay fingerprinted against the connection settings (`_model_cache_signature`). Adding a valve that changes which models an endpoint returns means adding it to that signature.
- The API key valves use `EncryptedStr`, which encrypts on pydantic validation. OpenWebUI persists `Valves(**form_data).model_dump()`, so the validator's output is what reaches the DB — and it re-validates on every valve save, which is why `encrypt_valve_secret` must stay idempotent and why `""` must stay `""` (a non-empty per-user key is treated as "user set their own"). OpenWebUI's own valve encryption (0.10.0+) is opt-in via `ENABLE_VALVE_ENCRYPTION`, which defaults to **False** — so on a default install this is the only thing keeping the key out of the DB in plaintext. Encryption is skipped when that flag is on (detected by importing the constant, not by comparing versions); decryption is *never* gated on it, so a key encrypted before the flag was flipped stays readable. Key derivation deliberately mirrors `open_webui/utils/valves.py::_fernet`.
- `_build_anthropic_client` is the single decryption point for the API key. New code paths must get their client from there rather than passing `valves.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to the SDK directly.
- Task requests and sub-agent runs must return plain prose: no collapsibles, no replay carriers, no token footer, no metadata markers.
- Tool approval is enforced by the pipe, not by OpenWebUI: OpenWebUI's gate lives inside its native tool loop, which a manifold never enters. The mode arrives as `__metadata__["params"]["tool_approval_mode"]` and the prompt channel as `__event_call__`; both are carried in the `TOOL_APPROVAL` ContextVar because the `Pipe` object is shared across concurrent requests. A missing or broken channel must **deny**, never silently allow.
- A denied tool returns a normal tool-result payload, not an exception — the model has to be able to continue the turn. The un-awaited coroutine has to be closed, or Python logs "never awaited".
- Changing a valve's *type* breaks every user who already has a value stored: OpenWebUI validates the whole `UserValves` model on save, so an old `""` against a new `List[str]` fails the save with a 400. Add a `field_validator(mode="before")` that accepts the old shape (this is why `HIDE_BLOCKS` still parses a comma-separated string).

## Common failure patterns

| Symptom | First checks |
|---|---|
| Doubled text | text accumulation and message rebuild logic |
| Lost code-exec state | container marker persistence and resend |
| Tool loop stalls or repeats | assistant block conversion, tool results |
| Anthropic 400 errors | payload shape; sampling params on adaptive-thinking models; beta headers |
| Files disappear on later turns | metadata markers, dedupe logic, file-id restoration |
| Cache hit rate collapses | breakpoint placement, tool ordering, per-request appendices (`ENABLE_CACHE_DIAGNOSTICS`) |
| Web search rejects request | empty or invalid location fields |
| Skills do not activate | `SKILLS` valve, skill validation, Files API / code-execution prerequisites |

## Release checklist

1. Change `src/anthropic_pipe/**`.
2. Bump `version:` and add a changelog entry in `src/anthropic_pipe/pipe_template.py`.
3. `python helpers/build_anthropic_pipe.py` (writes `anthropic_pipe.py` and `anthropic_pipe.min.py`)
4. Mirror the changelog entry into `README.md` and update the "Current pipe version" line.
5. Commit `src/` **and** both regenerated artifacts.
