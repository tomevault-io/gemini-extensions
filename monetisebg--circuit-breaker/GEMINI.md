## What this package is

`@monetisebg/circuit-breaker` is an open-source npm package: a circuit breaker
for AI agents that stops a run before it burns tokens or spins in a loop.
Behaviour is selected by **mode**:

- `budget-guard` (default) — caps input and output tokens independently
  (`maxInputToken` / `maxOutputToken`, 10k each by default).
- `loop-killer` — hashes each step's state to detect repetition and trips
  when the same state recurs more than `maxRetries` times (default 3). With
  `detectRepeatedState: false` it falls back to a raw iteration cap.

- `worth-it` — a third `withCircuitBreaker` mode that works in **currency**, not
  token counts. It costs each step (`C_s = (I·P_in + O·P_out) / 1e6`, with prices
  quoted per 1M tokens in the currency's smallest unit, e.g. cents), smooths an
  EMA, projects the run's total spend (`C_proj = C_cum + EMA·R_s`) against a
  `budgetLimit`, and fires graduated events (`predictive_warning` at 0.70,
  `optimize_context` at 0.85, `tripped` + throw at 0.95). Progress (`R_s`) is
  developer-driven via a milestone API (the wrapper's `onWorthItStep` hook) — no
  LLM self-reporting. Trips are *checkpoint & pause* (the engine isn't latched).

The `worth-it` logic lives in a dedicated `WorthItEngine` (it has a different
shape from the token-counting modes: cost, pricing, milestones). The core
`CircuitBreaker` class is the single entry point for **all three** modes — in
`worth-it` mode it delegates to an internal `WorthItEngine`, exposing
`recordStep` / `completeMilestone` / `setCompletedMilestones` / `worthItMetrics`
(the token/loop methods like `addTokens` throw a `TypeError` in `worth-it` mode,
and vice versa). Each adapter branches on the mode: for `worth-it` it builds the
engine via `createWorthItRunner` and feeds it each step's `{ input, output,
model }`. The engine is also exported standalone at the `/worth-it` subpath for
frameworks without an adapter.

Decision logic lives in a framework-agnostic core; each agent framework gets
its own thin adapter exposed as a subpath import. The breaker emits
`CircuitBreakerEvent`s (`retry`, `stop` for the wrapper modes;
`predictive_warning`, `optimize_context`, `tripped` for worth-it) for
visibility into what it's doing.

Current adapters:

- `@monetisebg/circuit-breaker/langchain` — wraps any LangChain `Runnable`
  (e.g. `AgentExecutor`) via a `BaseCallbackHandler`.
- `@monetisebg/circuit-breaker/openai-agents` — wraps an `Agent` from the
  OpenAI Agents SDK using `Runner` events and `AbortSignal`.
- `@monetisebg/circuit-breaker/claude-agent-sdk` — wraps the Claude Agent
  SDK's `query` function; drives the breaker off the streamed `SDKMessage`s
  and aborts via the SDK's `abortController` option.
- `@monetisebg/circuit-breaker/langgraph-sdk` — wraps a LangGraph Platform
  `client.runs`; drives the breaker off the `events` stream mode (forced into
  `streamMode`), aborts the local stream and cancels the run server-side via
  `runs.cancel`. For an in-process `@langchain/langgraph` graph use the
  LangChain adapter instead — a compiled graph is a `Runnable`.
- `@monetisebg/circuit-breaker/vercel-ai-sdk` — wraps the Vercel AI SDK's
  `generateText`; drives the breaker off the injected `onStepFinish` (one step
  per LLM call) and aborts the tool-loop via the `abortSignal` option. Non-
  streaming only — `streamText` is not yet supported.
- `@monetisebg/circuit-breaker/worth-it` — the `WorthItEngine` + `ProgressTracker`
  + `createWorthItRunner` (cost-predictive mode). Used internally by every
  adapter for `mode: "worth-it"`; also usable directly for frameworks without an
  adapter (`recordStep` / `completeMilestone`).

Every adapter accepts `mode: "worth-it"` (with `budgetLimit`, `currency`,
`milestones`, `pricing`/`defaultPricing`, and an optional `onWorthItStep` hook)
in addition to the two token/loop modes. Pricing is per-1M-tokens in the
currency's smallest unit (`ModelPricing.inputPerMToken` / `outputPerMToken`).

The package root (`@monetisebg/circuit-breaker`) exports the core:
`CircuitBreaker`, `CircuitBreakerError`, `WorthItEngine`, `ProgressTracker`,
and the option/context types.

Build output goes to `dist/` with one ESM bundle, one CJS bundle, and one
`.d.ts` per entry (`index`, `langchain`, `openai-agents`,
`claude-agent-sdk`, `langgraph-sdk`, `vercel-ai-sdk`, `worth-it`).

## Commands

```bash
npm install              # install dev + peer deps locally
npm run typecheck        # tsc --noEmit
npm test                 # vitest run
npm run test:watch       # vitest in watch mode
npm run build            # tsup → dist/ (ESM + CJS + types, multi-entry)
```

`npm run prepublishOnly` chains typecheck + test + build and is the gate
before publishing.

---

## Engineering conventions

- **TypeScript everywhere**, strict mode. `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` is on —
  index access on arrays/records returns `T | undefined`; handle it.
- **No code comments unless they explain a non-obvious *why*.** Identifiers
  should explain *what*. Don't reference current tasks or PR numbers.
- **No backwards-compat shims.** We're pre-1.0; breaking changes are OK,
  prefer cleaner APIs.
- **Errors are typed.** `CircuitBreakerError` carries `reason`, `metrics`,
  `limits`. Don't throw generic `Error` when the breaker trips.
- **Peer deps are optional.** A user importing `/langchain` must not be
  forced to install `@openai/agents`, and vice versa. Subpath bundles must
  not cross-import — `src/openai-agents/` must never reach into
  `src/langchain/` and vice versa. Both may import from `src/core/`.
- **Tests don't hit the network.** Adapters are tested against fake
  framework objects (LangChain: a stub runnable that fires callbacks;
  OpenAI Agents: `vi.mock("@openai/agents", …)` with an EventEmitter-backed
  `FakeRunner`).
- **One breaker per invocation.** Adapters construct a fresh `CircuitBreaker`
  each time their entry method (`invoke` / `run`) is called. The wrappers
  must be safe to reuse and to call concurrently.

### Style choices baked into the codebase

- Iterations are counted at *call start* (LLM call / agent turn). In
  `loop-killer` mode the adapter also passes a `stateKey` derived from the
  latest message / turn input; the core hashes it and trips on repetition.
- Token tripping is checked *after each call completes* (the call that
  pushed us over still counts). Tokens are tracked in every mode but only
  trip in `budget-guard`.
- Both `addTokens(deltaIn, deltaOut)` and `setTokenSnapshot(absIn, absOut)`
  exist on the core — adapters pick whichever matches the framework's data
  model (LangChain uses deltas via `handleLLMEnd`; @openai/agents uses
  snapshots via `RunContext.usage`).
- `saved` in `TripContext` / `stop` events is signed `limit - usage`:
  positive means headroom, negative means the over-the-limit call counted.
- Listeners (`onEvent`) errors are swallowed in the core — a buggy listener
  must never break the agent run.

## Adding a new framework adapter

The whole point of the core/adapter split. Recipe:

1. **Create `src/<framework>/`** with at least `wrapper.ts` and `index.ts`.
2. **Import the core**: `CircuitBreaker`, `CircuitBreakerError`, and the
   relevant types from `../core/index.js`. Do not duplicate decision logic.
3. **Map framework events onto core primitives**:
   - On each new LLM call / agent step → `breaker.recordIteration(stateKey?)`.
     Pass a `stateKey` (string summary of the step's input — typically the
     latest message / turn item) so `loop-killer` mode can detect repeats.
   - On per-call usage → `breaker.addTokens(input, output)`.
   - On a running total exposed by the framework →
     `breaker.setTokenSnapshot(totalIn, totalOut)`.
4. **Decide how to abort**. If the framework supports `AbortSignal`, use it
   (see `openai-agents/wrapper.ts`). If it propagates exceptions from
   callbacks, throw directly (see `langchain/callback.ts`). Either way, the
   public throw type must be `CircuitBreakerError`.
5. **Honour `onTrip`**: if provided, suppress the error and return whatever
   `onTrip(context)` returns. Type the wrapper so this becomes a union with
   the framework's normal return type.
6. **Add the entry to `tsup.config.ts`** and to the `exports` map in
   `package.json`. Add the framework as an *optional* peer dep with
   `peerDependenciesMeta.<name>.optional = true`.
7. **Write tests** under `tests/<framework>/` that don't require network
   access — mock or stub the framework's runtime.
8. **Update `README.md`** with a usage example.

If a framework only gives you post-hoc usage info (no mid-run hooks), token
limits won't be enforceable mid-run for it — document that explicitly. Same
caveat applies to `loop-killer` if you can't extract a per-step state key
from the framework.

## CI/CD

Two workflows under `.github/workflows/`:

- **`ci.yml`** — runs on every push (any branch) and every PR targeting
  `develop` or `main`. Matrix: Node 22 (Maintenance LTS) and Node 24
  (Active LTS). Steps: `npm ci`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm test`,
  `npm run build`. Concurrent runs on the same ref cancel each other.
  Third-party actions are pinned to commit SHAs with a version-comment
  trailer; tokens have least-privilege `permissions:` blocks.
- **`release.yml`** — runs on push of tags matching `v*.*.*`. Publishes on
  Node 24. Verifies the tag is reachable from `main` and that the tag
  version matches `package.json`, then runs the same gates as CI and
  finally `npm publish --access public --provenance`. Provenance requires
  `id-token: write` (already set in the workflow) and authenticates against
  npm via OIDC.

Authentication: the workflow uses **npm Trusted Publishing** — there is no
long-lived `NPM_TOKEN` to manage. The trusted publisher must be configured
once on the package's npm settings page (Publisher: GitHub Actions, repo
`MonetiseBG/circuit-breaker`, workflow `release.yml`). npm has no
"pending publisher" support, so the very first publish has to be done
manually (`npm publish --access public`, without `--provenance`); from
the second release onwards the workflow handles it via OIDC.

---

## Release flow

1. Land your changes on `develop` (PRs, merges, etc.).
2. Open a PR `develop → main`. Merge once CI is green.
3. Pull `main` locally and bump the version:
   ```bash
   git checkout main && git pull
   npm version patch    # or minor / major; we're 0.x so breaking → minor
   git push origin main --follow-tags
   ```
   `npm version` creates the bump commit AND the matching `v<version>` tag.
   `--follow-tags` pushes both in one go.
4. The tag push triggers `release.yml`, which publishes to npm.
5. Cherry-pick or merge the version-bump commit back into `develop` so the
   two branches don't diverge on `package.json`.

If the release workflow rejects the tag (mismatch with `package.json`, or
not on `main`), delete the bad tag (`git tag -d v… && git push --delete
origin v…`) and retry.

---

## Branching

- `develop` — default working branch. Feature work on short-lived branches
  off `develop`, merged back via PR.
- `main` — release-tagged commits only. Updated via PR from `develop`. Only
  tags pointing at commits on `main` can be published by `release.yml`.
