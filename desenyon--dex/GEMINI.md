# Dex

Dex is a single binary developer command center built in Go.

It is not a basic utility collection. It is an interactive terminal operating layer for developers that combines networking, process intelligence, API tooling, JSON tooling, system diagnostics, regex engineering, benchmarking, files, clipboard, and terminal visualization.

Dex must feel fast, beautiful, local first, deeply useful, and powerful enough that developers install it on every machine.

## Core Principles

1. One binary.
2. No background daemon required by default.
3. Every command works in plain CLI mode.
4. Every major module also has an interactive TUI mode.
5. Output must support human, JSON, CSV, Markdown, and raw modes.
6. No AI features for now.
7. No logs module.
8. No debug module.
9. No dependency manager, pip environment, git, or code context features.
10. The CLI should feel premium, polished, and visually alive.

## Global Command Shape

```bash
dex <module> <command> [args] [flags]
```

Examples:

```bash
dex network ip
dex network ports
dex process inspect 1234
dex api replay session.dexapi
dex json lens data.json
dex system health
dex regex lab
```

## Global Flags

```bash
--json
--csv
--markdown
--raw
--watch
--interval 1s
--no-color
--theme dark
--profile default
--save
--export path
--copy
--quiet
--verbose
```

## Global Interactive Mode

```bash
dex
```

Launches the Dex dashboard.

Sections:

```text
Network
Processes
API
JSON
System
Regex
Benchmark
Files
Clipboard
Terminal
Settings
```

The TUI must support:

```text
vim navigation
fuzzy search
command palette

# Non Negotiable Quality Bar

Dex must be:

```text
fast
beautiful
local first
keyboard native
scriptable
safe by default
cross platform where possible
Mac optimized first
useful without accounts
useful without AI
powerful in plain CLI
excellent in TUI
```

# Final Product Vision

Dex should become the one terminal tool a developer opens when something feels wrong, slow, unclear, broken, exposed, unstable, or hard to inspect.

It should answer:

```text
What is my machine doing?
What is my network doing?
What is this process doing?
What is this API doing?
What changed?
What is slow?
What is exposed?
What is using resources?
What does this data look like?
How do I inspect this faster?
```

Dex is the developer cockpit for the local machine.
