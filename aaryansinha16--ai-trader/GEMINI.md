## How to Run

### Prerequisites
```bash
brew services start postgresql@17   # TimescaleDB must be running
cd /Users/aaryansinha/Dev/Projects/ai-trader
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### Backend (Flask API)
```bash
python backend/app.py              # http://localhost:5050
```
Auto-starts `collect_ticks.py` during market hours via `_ensure_collector()`.

### Frontend (Next.js dashboard)
```bash
cd dashboard && npm run dev         # http://localhost:3000
```

### Live Tick Collector (market hours only: 9:15–15:30 IST)
```bash
# Flask auto-starts this. To run manually:
nohup .venv/bin/python scripts/collect_ticks.py >> logs/tick_collector_YYYYMMDD.log 2>&1 &
```
Writes to `/tmp/td_live_prices.json` every 1s (Flask reads this for streaming prices).

### Retrain Models (after market close)
```bash
# Full retrain on ALL historical data (preferred):
python scripts/incremental_train.py

# Incremental only (1–2 new days, uses warm-start):
python scripts/incremental_train.py --days 1

# Full retrain from scratch:
python main.py train
```

### Fill Missing Data
```bash
# Fill today's candles + ticks for NIFTY-I + all ATM options via REST:
python scripts/backfill_today.py

# Fill specific date for a single symbol:
python scripts/fetch_missing_ticks.py --dates 2026-03-25 --symbol NIFTY-I
```

### DB Init / Schema
```bash
python -c "from database.db import init_db; init_db()"
```

---

## Database Schema (TimescaleDB Hypertables)

| Table | Key Columns | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `tick_data` | `timestamp, symbol, price, volume, oi, bid_price, ask_price` | Hypertable; ~8k ticks/day/symbol |
| `minute_candles` | `timestamp, symbol, open, high, low, close, volume, vwap, oi` | Primary ML training source; upsert by (timestamp, symbol) |
| `option_chain` | `timestamp, symbol, underlying, expiry, strike, option_type, ltp, oi, iv, delta` | Snapshots |
| `symbol_master` | `symbol, underlying, expiry, strike, option_type, lot_size` | TrueData F&O universe |
| `trade_log` | `entry_time, exit_time, symbol, side, entry_price, pnl, ml_score, final_score` | Paper trade history |
| `features_macro` | 17 feature columns | Computed from minute_candles |
| `features_micro` | 5 feature columns | bid_ask_spread, order_imbalance, etc. |
| `daily_performance` | `date, total_trades, wins, net_pnl, win_rate` | EOD summary |

All timestamps are `TIMESTAMPTZ` (stored UTC, displayed as IST +5:30).

---

## TrueData Integration

### Symbol Naming
```
NIFTY-I            → NIFTY continuous futures (historical bars, live ticks)
NIFTY 50           → NIFTY spot index (websocket subscription only)
NIFTY{YYMMDD}{STRIKE}{CE|PE}  → Options e.g. NIFTY26033022950PE
```
NIFTY weekly expiry is on **Tuesdays** (confirmed from symbol_master table).

### WebSocket (live streaming)
- URL: `wss://push.truedata.in:8084?user=X&password=Y`
- Auth response: `{"success": true, "segments": ["FO","IND",""], "maxsymbols": 50}`
- Subscribe: `{"method": "addsymbol", "symbols": ["NIFTY-I", ...]}`
- Subscription snapshot: `{"symbollist": [[symbol, symbolID, ts, LTP, ...], ...]}` (18 fields, starts with symbol name)
- **Live streaming ticks**: `{"trade": [symbolID, ts, LTP, LTQ, ATP, TTQ, O, H, L, prevclose, OI, prevOI, turnover, tag, bid_qty, bid, ask_qty, ask]}` — **no symbol name**, symbolID must be mapped
- Heartbeats: `{"message": "HeartBeat", "timestamp": "..."}`
- `_symbol_id_map` in `TrueDataAdapter` maps `symbolID → symbol name` built during `ws_subscribe()`

### Rate Limits
- REST: 1 request/second (`TD_RATE_LIMIT_RPS = 1`)
- WebSocket: max 50 symbols per connection

### REST Endpoints
```
GET  https://history.truedata.in/getbars        → OHLCV bars (1min/5min/eod)
GET  https://history.truedata.in/getticks       → tick data
GET  https://history.truedata.in/getlastnbars   → last N bars (max 200)
GET  https://history.truedata.in/getlastnticks  → last N ticks (max 200)
POST https://auth.truedata.in/token             → bearer token
```

## ML Pipeline

### Models
| Model | File | Algorithm | Training data |
|---|---|---|---|
| Macro | `models/saved/macro_model.pkl` | XGBoost | All minute_candles for NIFTY-I (6+ months) |
| Micro | `models/saved/micro_model.pkl` | XGBoost | All tick_data (all available days) |
| Strategy models | `models/saved/strategy/*.pkl` | XGBoost | Per-strategy actual trade outcomes (WIN/LOSS) |
| RL Exit Agent | `models/saved/rl_exit_agent.pkl` | Q-learning | Premium trajectories from all backtest journeys |

### Training
- **MacroModelTrainer**: `train(df, walk_forward=True, n_splits=5)` — 5-fold walk-forward validation on 58 features
- **MicroModelTrainer**: `train(df, walk_forward=True, n_splits=3)` — 3-fold on 5 micro features
- Always backup existing model before retraining: `models/saved/backups/YYYYMMDD/model_HHMMSS.pkl`

> **WARNING — Do NOT retrain macro/micro models until there are enough outcome-labeled trades.**
> Retraining disrupts the XGBoost weights → different entry bar selection → RL agent never sees trained states → RL_EXIT stops firing → fragile P&L baseline breaks.
> The macro model's label quality is especially sensitive: `generate_macro_labels(forward_periods=15, threshold=0.001)` gives ~14% positive rate and varied 0.2–0.7 outputs. Using higher thresholds (e.g., 0.004/25 bars) compresses all outputs near 0, kills discrimination.

### Outcome-Based Strategy Model Training (NEW)
```bash
# Train per-strategy models on ACTUAL trade outcomes from backtest CSVs:
python scripts/train_outcome_models.py

# Options:
python scripts/train_outcome_models.py --min-samples 20  # lower threshold
python scripts/train_outcome_models.py --evaluate        # stats only, no train
```
- Reads `backtest_results/trades_{high,medium,low}_risk.csv`
- For each trade: fetches NIFTY-I candle at `entry_time` from DB → 50-feature vector
- Labels: 1 = WIN (TRAILING_SL/TIMEOUT/RL_EXIT/EOD_CLOSE/TARGET or pnl>0), 0 = LOSS
- Saves `models/saved/strategy/{strategy_name}_model.pkl` with backup

### RL Exit Agent — Journey-Based Retraining (NEW)
```bash
# Retrain RL Q-learning agent on ALL saved trade journeys:
python scripts/train_rl_on_journeys.py            # default 30 epochs
python scripts/train_rl_on_journeys.py --epochs 50
python scripts/train_rl_on_journeys.py --evaluate  # policy stats only
python scripts/train_rl_on_journeys.py --fresh     # reset Q-table from scratch
```
- Reads `backtest_results/journeys_{high,medium,low}_risk.json`
- State features are all trade-relative (pnl_pct, bars_held_norm, momentum, etc.) — no entry timing dependency
- Each epoch shuffles journey order for generalization; best Q-table (by avg reward) is restored at end
- Run after every significant batch of new backtest trades

### Features (58 macro, 5 micro)
**Macro** (from `FEATURE_COLUMNS_MACRO` in settings.py): RSI, MACD, EMA(9/20/50), SMA200, VWAP distance, Bollinger, ATR, StochRSI, Williams%R, ROC, ADX, CCI, OBV slope, MFI, PCR, IV, OI change, days_to_expiry, multi-timeframe RSI/EMA (5m/15m), session time features.

**Micro** (from `FEATURE_COLUMNS_MICRO`): `bid_ask_spread, order_imbalance, trade_size_spike, volume_burst, tick_momentum`.

### Trade Scoring
```
final_score = 0.5 × ML_prob + 0.3 × flow_score + 0.2 × technical_strength ± regime_bonus
```
- `ML_prob` = directional probability from macro model (CALL: direct, PUT: 1 − prob)
- `flow_score` = PCR-based: 0.5 default; `min(0.3*(pcr>1.2)+0.2, 1.0)` when PCR available
- `technical_strength` = from signal generator per-strategy

### Training Workflow (Post-Market)
```bash
# 1. Retrain outcome-based strategy models (safe — small XGBoost, separate from macro):
python scripts/train_outcome_models.py

# 2. Retrain RL agent with new journey data:
python scripts/train_rl_on_journeys.py --epochs 50

# 3. Full macro/micro retrain (DANGEROUS — only when baseline is confirmed stable):
python scripts/incremental_train.py
```

## Risk Profiles

| Profile | Score Threshold (CALL/PUT) | SL | Target | Max Trades/Day | Afternoon Cut |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| LOW (Conservative) | 0.70 / 0.80 | 20% | 35% | 3 | 11:45 IST |
| MEDIUM (Balanced) | 0.60 / 0.70 | 20% | 50% | 5 | 12:30 IST |
| HIGH (Aggressive) | 0.58 / 0.65 | 20% | 80% | 8 | 13:15 IST |

NIFTY lot size = 65 units. Suggestion SL/target in `backend/app.py`:
```python
INITIAL_SL_PCT = 0.15   # SL = entry × 0.85
TGT_PCT = 0.50          # Target = entry × 1.50
SUGGESTION_COOLDOWN_SECS = 300  # 5 min between re-suggesting same signal
```

---

## Flask API Routes (backend/app.py — port 5050)

```
GET  /api/state                → full scanner state (regime, suggestions, positions)
GET  /api/stream               → SSE stream (NIFTY price, state updates every ~1s)
POST /api/scan                 → manual trigger scan
POST /api/paper/enter          → enter paper trade
POST /api/paper/exit           → exit paper trade
GET  /api/paper/positions      → open positions
POST /api/paper/clear          → clear all positions
GET  /api/live/prices          → live prices from tick cache
GET  /api/trades/history       → past trades
GET  /api/equity/curve         → equity curve for chart
GET  /api/risk/profiles        → list risk profiles
GET  /api/days                 → dates with candle data
GET  /api/market/candles       → last N candles for symbol
GET  /api/market/candles/date  → candles for specific date+symbol

POST /api/backtest/run         → run backtest
GET  /api/backtest/results     → saved backtest results
GET  /api/backtest/progress    → backtest progress SSE
```

### Key State Variables (in-memory, resets on Flask restart)
```python
state = {
    "trade_suggestions": [...],  # expires after SUGGESTION_COOLDOWN_SECS
    "positions": [...],          # open paper trades
    "regime": "...",
    "status": "idle|scanning|market_closed"
}
```

### Background Threads
- `background_scanner` — runs every 30s, calls `scan_market()` + `_ensure_collector()`
- `_tick_monitor_loop` — runs every 1s, updates open position prices from tick cache
- `collect_ticks.py` — separate subprocess, auto-started by `_ensure_collector()`

---

## Live Price Cache

**File**: `/tmp/td_live_prices.json`

**Format**: `{"NIFTY-I": {"price": 22950.0, "ts": "2026-03-27T13:42:47.362923"}, ...}`

- Written every 1s by `collect_ticks.py`'s `_flush_price_cache` thread
- `ts` = **wall-clock time when tick was received** (NOT the tick's market timestamp)
- Flask reads this in `_tick_monitor_loop` and the SSE stream
- `_cache_prices_are_fresh(max_age_secs=90)` returns False if file >30s old or all ts >90s old → triggers collector restart

---

## Key Conventions

### Python
- All DB calls via `read_sql(sql, params)` / `write_df(df, table)` / `upsert_candles(df)` — never raw psycopg2
- `from dotenv import load_dotenv; load_dotenv()` at top of every script (not inside functions)
- Logger via `from utils.logger import get_logger; logger = get_logger("name")`
- Timestamps: DB stores UTC `TIMESTAMPTZ`, Python uses naive local IST for comparisons
- Option symbols: `NIFTY{YYMMDD}{STRIKE}{CE|PE}` e.g. `NIFTY26033022950PE`
- Expiry from `backtest.option_resolver.get_nearest_expiry(date)` — queries symbol_master table

### Frontend (Next.js / TypeScript)
- API calls via `dashboard/lib/api.ts` helper
- SSE stream consumed in `dashboard/app/live/page.tsx`
- All times displayed in IST
- Trade table columns include: Time, Symbol, Type, Strategy, Risk (LOW/MED/HIGH badge), SL ₹, Target ₹, Expiry, Score, ML%, Action

---

## What NOT To Do

- **Don't subscribe to `NIFTY 50` (spot) in `collect_ticks.py`** — this was a 2026-04-08 bug that corrupted every macro feature. Spot and futures prices differ by ~50pt, and when both were stored under `symbol='NIFTY-I'` in `tick_data`, the resulting minute candles had fake ~40pt high-low ranges that poisoned RSI/ATR/Bollinger/MACD and silently destroyed the macro_model retrains. Only subscribe to `NIFTY-I` futures. The `on_tick()` handler has a defensive drop for any leaking spot symbol.
- **Don't use `expiries[-1]` as a fallback in `get_nearest_expiry()`** — this was the 2026-04-08 bug that had the live collector subscribing to *yesterday's* expired contracts every morning. The only correct source for future expiries is TrueData REST `getSymbolExpiryList` (cached 1h). DB-derived expiries are only correct for historical backtests on past dates. `get_nearest_expiry()` now splits these two paths.
- **Don't apply entry gates uniformly across strategies** — the 2026-04-08 first-pass fix broke MEDIUM from ₹+51k → ₹+37k because the previous-bar confirmation gate and micro-momentum gate were structurally wrong for reversal strategies (`bearish_momentum`, `mean_reversion`). A reversal signal *should* fire against recent momentum by design. Both gates now have a `CONTINUATION_STRATEGIES = {"vwap_momentum_breakout"}` check. If you add a new strategy, decide whether it's continuation or reversal before wiring gates.
- **Don't use tick-COUNT windows for option-premium confirmation** — "last 10 ticks" can span 20 minutes on illiquid strikes and produce meaningless slopes. The Fix D gate uses a 30-SECOND time window and fails open if <8 ticks exist in that window.
- **Don't check SL against `min(p_low_bid, self.sl)` after ratcheting SL within the same bar** — this was the 2026-04-08 trailing-stop giveback bug. Bars that spiked +30% then crashed to -5% activated trailing AND filled at -5% instead of at the trailing lock. Check SL against PRIOR sl, ratchet only after no exit, fill at `prior_sl` (not bar low).
- **Don't use `incremental_train.py --days N` where N > 3** — safety guard rejects it; use `main.py train` for full retrains
- **Don't retrain macro/micro models without a stable backtest baseline** — retraining changes XGBoost weights → different entry bars → RL_EXIT may stop firing → P&L collapses. Always restore from `backups/` if results degrade.
- **Don't use `generate_macro_labels(threshold > 0.002, forward_periods > 20)`** — higher thresholds yield <5% positive rate → model outputs near-0 for all bars → directional_prob for PUT ≈ 1.0 constant → no signal filtering. Keep `threshold=0.001, forward_periods=15`.
- **Don't convert IST timestamps to UTC when joining backtest CSVs to DB candles** — both store IST mislabeled as +00:00 (no actual offset). Strip tzinfo and compare naively.
- **Don't write candles with raw `write_df(..., if_exists='append')`** — use `upsert_candles()` which handles `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` on (timestamp, symbol). Bare append causes duplicate key errors.
- **Don't delete today's candles and re-insert inside `upsert_candles()`** — do the DELETE separately before calling upsert if you need a clean replace
- **Don't start `collect_ticks.py` as a plain `&` subprocess from a Bash shell** — it gets SIGHUP when the shell exits. Always use `nohup ... &`
- **Don't store the tick's market timestamp as `ts` in live_price_cache** — for illiquid options, the market timestamp can be hours old, making Flask think prices are stale and killing the collector. Use `datetime.now().isoformat()` (wall-clock receipt time)
- **Don't call `ws_start_streaming(callback)` multiple times with the same callback** — it deduplicates now, but prior reconnect loops created duplicate stream threads. The `_stream_loop` handles reconnection internally; only call `ws_start_streaming()` once at startup
- **Don't assume TrueData sends streaming ticks as plain JSON arrays** — they changed the format to `{"trade": [symbolID, ts, LTP, ...]}` (dict with no symbol name). The symbolID→name map is built in `ws_subscribe()` and used in `_stream_loop`
- **Don't parse `minute_candles` timestamps as naive datetimes** — they're stored as UTC TIMESTAMPTZ; when comparing to `datetime.now()` (IST), the 5:30h offset matters
- **Don't add `print()` statements to Flask routes** — use `logger` (Flask stdout is not shown in production)
- **Don't run Flask in debug mode with the reloader** — the reloader forks processes and double-starts background threads (scanner + tick monitor run twice)
- **Don't re-enable `max_trades_day` gate until outcome models have AUC > 0.55** — currently disabled in both `backend/app.py` and `tick_replay_backtest.py` to collect more training data. The gate is commented with `# TEMP: disabled to collect more training data`

## Important Operational Notes

- **Market hours**: 9:15–15:30 IST weekdays. `_is_market_hours()` guards scanner and collector startup
- **NIFTY lot size**: 65 units (1 lot = 65 shares)
- **NIFTY weekly expiry**: Tuesdays by default, but individual weeks can be holiday-shifted (e.g. Apr 14 2026 → Apr 13 because Apr 14 is a national holiday). Never hard-code a weekday; always fetch from TrueData REST `getSymbolExpiryList`.
- **ATM strike gap**: 50 points for NIFTY
- **TickCollector buffer**: flushes to `tick_data` every 200 ticks
- **Candle aggregation**: done by `collect_ticks.py` in-memory per minute, written via `upsert_candles()`
- **Tick gap backfill**: `_backfill_ticks_if_stale()` runs every scan cycle during market hours, detects leading/internal/trailing gaps in today's `tick_data`, and fills them via TrueData REST `getticks`. Throttled to once per 60s.
- **Model backups**: stored in `models/saved/backups/` with timestamp suffix before each retrain
- **Logs**: `logs/tick_collector_YYYYMMDD.log` (one file per day), `logs/trading.log`
- **Backtest results**: `backtest_results/*.json` and `*.csv`
- **Backtest mode**: `scripts/tick_replay_backtest.py` uses tick-level option premium data via `load_option_premiums_for_day()`. The function detects tick availability and falls back to minute candles only when <50 ticks exist. Exit logic (SL/target/trailing) walks individual ticks within each minute when in tick mode.
- **Entry gates** (in order, all in `backend/app.py:scan_market()` and `scripts/tick_replay_backtest.py`):
    1. Score threshold (≥ 0.75, strategy-specific raises: mean_reversion 0.80, vwap 0.78)
    2. Previous-bar direction confirmation — **continuation strategies only**
    3. Micro-momentum confirmation (tick_momentum) — **continuation strategies only**
    4. Option-premium confirmation (Fix D) — **all strategies**, 30s window, 0.8% drop threshold
- **Intra-trade regime exit**: `_tick_monitor_loop` has three tiers — 0.10% adverse NIFTY move (log), 0.20% (tighten SL to entry+2%), 0.30% (HARD EXIT if option is underwater). Check interval 10s.
