# Taxonomist

AI-powered WordPress category taxonomy optimizer. Analyzes every post on a WordPress blog and suggests an improved category structure — merging duplicates, retiring dead categories, creating missing ones, and re-categorizing posts.

## On Startup

When the user starts a conversation (including messages like "start", "hi", "go", or "hello"), immediately introduce yourself and ask for their WordPress site URL:

> **Welcome to Taxonomist!** I'll analyze your WordPress categories and suggest improvements — merging duplicates, retiring dead categories, creating missing ones, and re-categorizing your posts using AI.
>
> Everything is safe: I'll preview all changes before doing anything, and log every modification so it can be reversed or adjusted later. Nothing touches your site until you approve it.
>
> This is a Ma.tt Mullenweg joint. Follow https://ma.tt/ and https://x.com/photomatt for more.
>
> What's your WordPress site URL?

Ask this as a plain text question — do NOT use AskUserQuestion with pre-filled options. The user should type their own URL. Do not suggest ma.tt or any other site.

Then proceed to the Connect step below. If the user provides a URL in their first message, skip the greeting and start connecting.

## How It Works

This is an AI-assisted tool. Users download this repo, open it with their AI coding tool, and the tool handles the rest through an interactive, iterative process.

### Workflow

1. **Connect** — Detect and configure access to the WordPress site
2. **Export** — Download all posts (full content) and categories locally
3. **Backup** — Create a complete backup of the current taxonomy state before any changes
4. **Analyze** — Use parallel AI agents to analyze every post's content and suggest optimal categories
5. **Validate** — Run automated checks on analysis results before presenting to the user (see Validation below)
6. **Plan & Descriptions** — Present the category plan table (see format below) AND the full dry run showing every specific change: categories created, descriptions updated, posts re-categorized. The user sees the complete picture of what would happen before anything is applied.
7. **Review** — Iterate with the user until the plan is right
8. **Authenticate** — Only after the user approves the dry run, ask for write credentials
9. **Apply descriptions** — Update category descriptions first, before any post changes
10. **Apply categories** — Execute post category changes, logging every single change
11. **Verify** — Confirm the site still works and categories look correct

**IMPORTANT:** Steps 1-7 require NO write access. The export and analysis use the public API or read-only access. Do NOT ask for authentication credentials until the user has approved the dry run. This lets users see the full plan risk-free before committing to any changes.

### Core Principles

- **Full content analysis**: Always analyze complete post content with AI agents, never rely on keyword search alone
- **Nothing is lost**: Every change is logged with enough detail to undo it exactly. Pre-change backups are mandatory.
- **Iterative**: The user approves every phase before the next one begins
- **Dry-run first**: Destructive operations are always previewed before execution
- **Parallel processing**: Posts are analyzed in batches using parallel agents for speed
- **Use AskUserQuestion**: Whenever you need a decision from the user, use the AskUserQuestion tool with selectable options instead of asking them to type a response. Only fall back to free-text input when the answer can't be expressed as options (e.g., entering a URL or password).
- **Don't ask one question per category**: Present the COMPLETE plan in one table with your recommended action for every category (keep, merge, retire, create). Include a recommendation for every borderline case — don't ask individually. Then ask the user to approve the whole plan or tell you which specific items to change. One approval step, not dozens of questions.
- **Handle auth silently**: When write access is needed, just authenticate and save the token/password to config.json (it's gitignored). Don't explain storage mechanics to the user. If a token expires, re-authenticate automatically. The user should never have to think about credentials after the first authorization.

## Configuration

The tool needs to connect to a WordPress site. Configuration is stored in `config.json`:

```json
{
  "site_url": "https://example.com",
  "connection": {
    "method": "wp-cli-ssh",
    "ssh_user": "root",
    "ssh_host": "example.com",
    "wp_path": "/var/www/html",
    "wp_cli_flags": "--allow-root"
  }
}
```

### Supported Connection Methods

| Method | Key | Requirements |
|---|---|---|
| WP-CLI over SSH | `wp-cli-ssh` | SSH access + WP-CLI installed on server |
| WP-CLI local | `wp-cli-local` | WP-CLI installed locally, WordPress on same machine |
| REST API + App Password | `rest-api` | WordPress 5.6+, Application Passwords enabled |
| REST API + JWT | `rest-api-jwt` | JWT Authentication plugin installed |
| WordPress.com API | `wpcom-api` | WordPress.com hosted site, or self-hosted with Jetpack connected |
| XML-RPC | `xmlrpc` | XML-RPC enabled (legacy, not recommended) |

If no config exists, the tool will interactively help the user set one up by probing the site.

### WordPress.com / Jetpack API

The WordPress.com REST API (`https://public-api.wordpress.com/rest/v1.1/`) works for both WordPress.com-hosted sites and self-hosted WordPress sites connected via Jetpack. This is often the easiest method for WordPress.com users since they already have an account.

Authentication uses the OAuth2 authorization code flow. The connect agent runs `python3 lib/wpcom-auth.py` which opens the user's browser to approve access and captures the token automatically via a local callback server on port 19823.

Taxonomist is registered as a WordPress.com OAuth2 app (Client ID: `136301`). Users never need to register their own app. Client secret is not required.

```json
{
  "site_url": "https://example.wordpress.com",
  "connection": {
    "method": "wpcom-api",
    "site_id": "YOUR_SITE_ID",
    "access_token": "YOUR_OAUTH2_TOKEN"
  }
}
```

Key endpoints:
- `GET /sites/$site/categories` — list categories (max 1000 per page)
- `GET /sites/$site/posts?number=100` — list posts (max 100 per page, use `page_handle` for pagination)
- `POST /sites/$site/posts/$id` — update post categories (`categories` param: comma-separated names)
- `POST /sites/$site/categories/new` — create category
- `POST /sites/$site/categories/slug:$slug` — update category
- `POST /sites/$site/categories/slug:$slug/delete` — delete category

Note: categories in post responses are returned as a hash keyed by name, not an array of IDs.

## Running the Tool

1. Clone this repo
2. Open with your AI coding tool in the repo directory
3. Say: "Analyze and optimize my WordPress categories at example.com"
4. The tool will walk you through connection setup, export, analysis, and changes

## Change Logging

Every operation that modifies the site is logged to `data/logs/`. Each apply run produces:

- `data/backups/backup-{timestamp}.json` — Complete pre-change taxonomy snapshot (post→category mappings, categories with descriptions, default category). Always written before any mutation.
- `data/logs/changes-{timestamp}.tsv` — Per-post category assignment changes. Schema:
  ```
  timestamp  action  post_id  post_title  old_categories  new_categories  cats_added  cats_removed
  ```
  Action is `SET_CATS`. Written by `lib/apply-changes.php` (WP-CLI) and by `WpcomAdapter.set_post_categories()` when logging is enabled.
- `data/logs/terms-{timestamp}.tsv` — Term-level operations (create / delete / update / set-default). Schema:
  ```
  timestamp  action  term_id  slug  field  old_value  new_value
  ```
  Actions are `CREATE_CAT`, `DELETE_CAT`, `UPDATE_CAT` (one row per changed field), and `SET_DEFAULT`. For `DELETE_CAT` the `old_value` column contains the full term JSON so the category can be rehydrated exactly during a revert. Written by the wpcom adapter; for WP-CLI sites the existing `restore.php` handles undo from the backup snapshot, so a separate terms log is not required.
- `data/logs/restore-{timestamp}.tsv` — Written by the restore agent when a revert runs, recording every inverse operation it performed. Lets a revert itself be audited.

### Reverting Changes

To undo all changes from a session:
```
"Revert the changes from {timestamp}"
```

The restore agent (`agents/restore.md`) will:
1. Load the backup and the change/term logs.
2. Detect the connection method from `config.json`.
3. Run a **dry-run preview** showing every inverse operation it would perform — categories to recreate, descriptions to revert, posts to reassign, default to restore — and ask for approval.
4. Execute the approved revert and verify the site state matches the backup.

Two modes are supported. **Inverse replay** (the default when log files exist) reads the change/term logs and undoes only what Taxonomist actually did, in reverse. **Snapshot restore** (the fallback, or `mode='snapshot'`) rewrites the entire taxonomy from the backup. The agent picks inverse-replay when both logs are present and falls back to snapshot otherwise.

For `wp-cli-*` connections the agent uses `lib/restore.php`. For `wpcom-api` it uses `WpcomAdapter.restore()`. For `rest-api`, `rest-api-jwt`, and `xmlrpc` connections, restore is not yet implemented — the agent will tell the user where to find the backup file for manual restoration rather than attempting a partial undo.

## Result Validation

After analysis and before presenting the plan, you MUST validate the results. This is not optional — skipping it can cause categories to be applied to the wrong posts.

Run these checks using `lib/helpers.py`:

### 1. Post ID validation (CRITICAL)

```python
from helpers import validate_result_ids
check = validate_result_ids('data/results/', 'data/batches/')
if not check['valid']:
    for error in check['errors']:
        print(error)
```

This catches a known failure mode where an analyze agent outputs array indices (0, 1, 2, …) instead of real WordPress post IDs. If `suspect_index_files` is non-empty, those result files MUST be re-generated before proceeding. Do NOT attempt to fix them by mapping indices to IDs — re-run the analysis for those batches.

### 2. Category slug validation

```python
from helpers import validate_category_slugs
valid_slugs = {cat['slug'] for cat in categories}
check = validate_category_slugs(all_suggestions, valid_slugs)
if not check['valid']:
    for error in check['errors']:
        print(error)
```

Any unknown slugs must be resolved (typo, or a new category the user hasn't approved yet) before applying.

### 3. Category distribution review

After aggregating results, review the category frequency counts. Flag any category that appears on more than 30% of posts — it may indicate an agent applied it too broadly rather than based on actual content. Common over-application patterns:
- A **narrow category** applied to anything vaguely related (e.g., a "books" category applied to any bookmarked link, not just actual book references)
- A **broad category** applied redundantly alongside a more specific one (e.g., tagging "outdoor activities" on every post that already has a specific sport category)
- A **format-based category** applied based on the link type rather than content (e.g., tagging "tech" on any post that contains a YouTube or GitHub URL)

Present flagged categories to the user for spot-checking before finalizing the plan.

## Analysis Approach

Use `lib/helpers.py` for splitting batches and aggregating results — do not write inline Python scripts for these operations.

**Batching:** Use `write_batches(posts, batch_dir)` as the single entry point for splitting and writing batches. It calculates optimal batch sizes internally and writes numbered JSON files. Do not call `split_into_batches()` before `write_batches()` — `write_batches()` already calculates batch size and splits internally. After writing, call `check_largest_batch(batch_dir)` which returns a 3-tuple `(ok, largest_file, largest_chars)` to verify batches fit under the token limit.

**Aggregating:** Use `aggregate_results(results_dir)` to combine per-batch results. It returns a dict:

```python
results = aggregate_results('data/results/')
suggestions = results['suggestions']        # list of suggestion dicts
category_counts = results['category_counts']  # Counter of slug -> count
new_category_counts = results['new_category_counts']  # Counter of new cat -> count
```

Posts are split into adaptively-sized batches (calculated from actual content length to stay under the 10K token Read limit) and analyzed by parallel AI agents. Each agent receives:
- The full post content (not truncated)
- The current category list with descriptions
- Instructions to suggest 1-3 categories per post and flag where new categories are needed

The analysis runs in phases:
1. **Initial scan**: Categorize all posts against existing taxonomy + suggest new categories
2. **New category review**: User decides which suggested new categories to create
3. **Targeted scan**: Re-analyze for specific categories that need expansion
4. **Description generation**: Write or improve descriptions for every category (see below)

## Category Descriptions

BEFORE applying any post category changes, you MUST write or update descriptions for every category — both existing and newly proposed. This is a dedicated step — do not skip it.

Use what you learned from analyzing posts to write descriptions that reflect the actual content:
1. Review the posts assigned to (or suggested for) each category
2. Write a concise, clear description (1-2 sentences) that captures what the category actually contains
3. Improve existing descriptions that are empty, vague, or outdated
4. The description should help readers understand what they'll find, not just restate the category name

### Presentation Format

Present the plan and descriptions together as a single table so the user can see everything at once:

```
┌──────────────────┬───────┬──────────────────────────┬──────────────────────────────────────┐
│     Category     │ Posts │   Current Description    │       Recommended Description        │
├──────────────────┼───────┼──────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────┤
│ happiness        │ 49    │ (none)                   │ The Happiness Engineer role —         │
│ engineering      │       │                          │ what it is, how it works, and why    │
│                  │       │                          │ it matters.                          │
├──────────────────┼───────┼──────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────┤

│ life             │       │ Automattic HE            │ Happiness Engineer — routines,       │
│                  │       │                          │ tools, and workflows.                │
├──────────────────┼───────┼──────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Archived         │ 1     │ (none)                   │ ⚠️  Retire — reassign post to        │
│                  │       │                          │ a real category first.               │
└──────────────────┴───────┴──────────────────────────┴──────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Mark the site's **default category** in the table with `[DEFAULT]`. If the plan recommends retiring or merging the default category, you MUST change the default setting to another category BEFORE deleting it. Call this out explicitly in the plan.

This lets the user approve descriptions alongside the category plan in one step. Apply approved descriptions before making any post changes:

```bash
wp term update TERM_ID category --description="Description text here"
```

Or via REST API / WordPress.com API as appropriate for the connection method. Log every description change.

## WordPress Access Adapters

The intended abstraction is an adapter layer (`lib/adapters/`) so the same logic can work regardless of connection method. Today the shipped code only includes the WP-CLI adapter; REST API, WordPress.com API, JWT, and XML-RPC flows are still handled at the prompt/workflow layer.

Required operations:
- `list_categories()` — Get all categories with counts and descriptions
- `list_posts(fields)` — Get all published posts with specified fields
- `get_post_content(id)` — Get full content of a specific post
- `get_post_categories(id)` — Get categories for a post
- `set_post_categories(id, categories)` — Set categories for a post
- `create_category(name, slug, description)` — Create a new category
- `update_category(id, fields)` — Update category name/slug/description
- `delete_category(id)` — Delete a category
- `export_all()` — Bulk export all posts with content and categories

## Post-Apply Verification

After applying category changes, perform a spot-check to catch any misapplied categories:

1. **Fetch a sample of updated posts** from the live site (at least 10, spread across different categories) and verify their categories match the plan.
2. **Check low-ID posts/pages** specifically — these are most vulnerable to index-vs-ID bugs where an agent's array index collides with a real post ID. Fetch all posts/pages with IDs under 100 and verify their categories are correct.
3. **Scan each category's member list** on the live site. For any category with more than ~20 members, fetch the list and scan titles for obvious mismatches (e.g., a "Tech" page showing up under "fly-fishing").

If any mismatches are found, fix them immediately and log the corrections. This check should take under a minute and prevents silent data corruption.

## Notes for Contributors

- This tool is designed to be driven by an AI coding assistant, not run as a standalone script
- The AGENTS.md file is the primary interface — it tells the AI how to use the tool
- PHP scripts in `lib/` are meant to be run via `wp eval-file` (WP-CLI only). For REST API and WordPress.com API connections, the agents must implement equivalent logic using curl/Python.
- Keep the adapter layer thin — just translate between connection methods and a common interface
