# pi-extensions agent and contributor guide

This repository contains small, independently installable extensions for the [Pi coding agent](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi). The project is public and portable: changes must work without access to a maintainer's machine, private services, or local daemon.

Each package owns its entrypoint, tests, configuration example, localization resources, and package README. The public package source of truth is this repository; consumers should install the published npm packages instead of copying package source into another project.

## Package boundaries

- `pi-safety-guards` is independently installable; see `packages/pi-safety-guards/README.md` for its configuration, behavior, and tests.
- `pi-nested-skills` is independently installable; see `packages/pi-nested-skills/README.md` for its configuration, behavior, and tests.
- `pi-notifications` is independently installable; see `packages/pi-notifications/README.md` for its configuration, behavior, and tests.
- `pi-naming` owns automatic Pi session titles and manual terminal naming; it uses pi-ai and terminal-mux, not session-tools. Automatic and manual naming share configurable session/workspace/tab targets.

- `pi-distill` discovers active tools with object parameter schemas and observes their results through Pi's native `tool_call` and `tool_result` events. It does not register duplicate tools.
- `pi-tool-supervisor` reviews the actual before/after diff of `edit` and `write` against configured rule files. It reports findings but is not an operating-system sandbox or an edit rollback mechanism.
- `pi-extensions-tool-display` owns the actual Pi tool-display host, built-in tool renderer overrides, and the shared result-rendering middleware protocol. Feature packages register domain-specific panels through it.
- `pi-extensions-i18n` owns locale selection, catalog validation, interpolation, and the `/pi-language` command. Feature packages use it instead of implementing separate locale runtimes.
- `pi-model-request` owns how an extension issues its own model request: resolve auth from the model registry, add the provider session headers (`x-opencode-session`, `x-opencode-client`) that Pi's core adds to its own requests, apply a resolved `baseUrl`, and call the completion. Any package that calls `completeSimple`/`complete` itself must go through it instead of re-deriving those rules.
- `pi-terminal-mux` owns terminal multiplexer detection and pane/surface operations. Extensions that need terminal interaction depend on it instead of re-implementing backend detection.
- `pi-metrics` owns session metrics: the live elapsed spinner and per-turn/total summaries listen to Pi's native `input`, `agent_start`, `turn_start`, `turn_end`, `agent_end`, and `agent_settled` events without registering tools.
- `pi-models-discovery` owns dynamic model discovery: it reads `discoverModels` providers from models.json, fetches `{baseUrl}/models`, persists a startup cache, and exposes `/model-discovery` plus `/model-discovery-refresh` commands.
- `pi-session-tools` owns the bash pipe output cache (`tool_call` rewrites `grep`/`tail`/`head` pipelines with `tee`) and `session_log`/`session_squash` for non-destructive conversation squashing; the main agent writes the handoff summary directly into the `session_squash` call.
- `pi-session-resources` observes successful tool results, rebuilds resources from the active session branch, and exposes file, browser, and PR/MR targets through a clickable, tabbed `#` picker above the editor without adding model-context messages.

Keep packages composable and independently installable. Avoid coupling one extension to another extension's private implementation details or display state.

## Portability and safety

- Do not commit user-specific paths, credentials, private domains, internal service names, or machine-specific defaults.
- Resolve user directories with `os.homedir()` or Pi's standard configuration directory. Support `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` where the package already exposes that configuration point.
- Optional external tools must be detected at runtime and have a graceful fallback or noop path.
- Do not make network calls, model assumptions, or local daemon availability implicit in deterministic tests.
- Use configuration or injected adapters for environment-specific behavior.

## User-facing text and localization

User-visible messages, command descriptions, tool descriptions, and agent-facing prompts must be backed by a catalog containing both `zh-CN` and `en-US` entries. Use `pi-extensions-i18n`'s `createTranslator` and `loadCatalog` helpers.

User-visible notices must go through `pi-extensions-i18n`'s `notifyWithSource`, not `ctx.ui.notify` directly. Pi renders `info` notices as one line of dim, unprefixed text, so every package carries a short source tag and the notice is drawn as a filled background block in the transcript (the same `customMessageBg` block Pi uses for extension messages):

```ts
const NOTICE_TAG = "distill";
const NOTICE_COLOR: NoticeColor = NOTICE_TAG_COLOR;
const NOTICE_SOURCE: NoticeSource = { tag: NOTICE_TAG, color: NOTICE_COLOR };

notifyWithSource({ ctx, source: NOTICE_SOURCE, level: "warning", message: i18n.t("failed") });
```

Keep the tag short and unique per package, keep the level accurate, and do not add colors outside TUI mode — the helper already handles that. The tag color (`NOTICE_TAG_COLOR`) is deliberately the same muted color for every package: nine theme color slots cannot distinguish sixteen packages, so the tag text identifies the source and the color never does. Level colors (warning/error body text) remain semantic and unchanged. The transcript block is registered once by `pi-extensions-i18n`'s own extension entry, so a package that uses the helper must load `../pi-extensions-i18n/index.ts` in its `pi.extensions` list. Verdict-style notices with their own semantic color pass `textColor` instead of building a footer status line.

Keep developer comments and implementation notes concise. Keep the English and Chinese README files separate so each language has a complete, readable entrypoint.

## Development

Requirements: Node.js 22 or newer and a compatible Pi extension runtime for manual smoke tests.

```bash
npm install
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run check
```

`npm run check` is the repository gate. It runs type checks, package tests, packaging checks, and the local-binding policy check. Tests should be deterministic and must not require API keys, a live reviewer model, or a particular filesystem layout.

When changing a package, also inspect its package-level README and `config.example.json`. If the public behavior changes, add or update focused tests and document the configuration or compatibility impact.

## Pull requests

Use Conventional Commits such as `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`, and `chore:`. A pull request should explain:

1. the user problem or maintenance problem;
2. the observable behavior that changed;
3. package and documentation impact;
4. validation performed, including any limitations.

Keep unrelated refactors out of a focused pull request. Run `npm run check` before requesting review.

## Releases

Versions and changelogs are managed by release-please. Merging a release PR publishes changed packages to npm through the repository's OIDC trusted-publishing workflow with provenance. Do not publish manually from a local machine unless the release procedure explicitly requires it.
