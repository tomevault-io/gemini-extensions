# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to AI agents and AI-assisted development tools when working with code in this repository. This includes Claude Code, Cursor IDE, GitHub Copilot, Windsurf, and any other AI coding assistants.

## Repository Overview

This repository contains Copier templates for Python, Java, Go, Elixir, C++, Rust, Kotlin, and TypeScript (React) that enforce strict validation guardrails on AI-generated code — catching antipatterns, suppressing silent defaults, and providing immediate feedback so AI agents write better, more maintainable code from the start.

## Core Coding Principles

These rules apply everywhere — repo scripts, justfiles, test infrastructure, and all language templates:

1. **Fail fast — never swallow errors.** Always propagate errors and exit with code 1 immediately. No silent fallbacks, no `|| true`, no ignored return codes. Use `set -e` or `&&` chaining in shell scripts.
2. **No default values — never assume missing values.** Check for required values explicitly and exit 1 if something is missing. Default values mask underlying issues and make them hard to debug.
3. **Never suppress checks with annotations.** Fix the underlying issue instead. No `@SuppressWarnings`, `# noqa`, `# type: ignore`, `#[allow(...)]`, `NOLINT`, `// noinspection`, `NOSONAR`, `@dialyzer`, `# shellcheck disable`, or any other mechanism that silences a checker.
4. **Use `printf` for color output — never `echo`.** Some terminals won't render ANSI escape sequences with `echo`. In shell scripts and justfiles, always use `printf` for colored or formatted text output. Plain `echo ""` is acceptable only for blank-line spacing.

## Git Commit Guidelines

**IMPORTANT:** When creating git commits in this repository:
- NEVER include AI attribution in commit messages
- NEVER add "Generated with [AI tool name]" or similar phrases
- NEVER add "Co-Authored-By: [AI name]" or similar attribution
- NEVER run `git add -A` or `git add .` - always stage files explicitly
- Keep commit messages professional and focused on the changes made
- Commit messages should describe what changed and why, without mentioning AI assistance
- ALWAYS run `git push` after creating a commit to push changes to the remote repository

### Violation Tests (`violations/`)

- `violations/<language>/<rule-name>/...` contains file overlays that intentionally introduce one forbidden pattern.
- Each violation case must map to an existing guardrail rule (Semgrep, Credo, or other checker) and use valid, compilable code.

**How violation testing works:**

The key principle is that we test the generated project's own CI justfile targets — the same `just code-semgrep`, `just code-security`, etc. that developers run. We're verifying that the project's built-in guardrails catch forbidden patterns, not running checks some other way.

1. **Generate** a fresh project from the template into a temp directory.
2. **Baseline** — run the project's full CI (`just ci`) on the clean project. It must pass. This confirms the template itself is valid.
3. **For each violation:**
   a. **Inject** — copy the violation's overlay files into the generated project (originals are backed up).
   b. **Stage** — `git add -A` so tools like semgrep see the new/changed files.
   c. **Run the project's targeted justfile recipe** — e.g. `just code-security`, `just code-semgrep`. The recipe name is read from a `check` file in the violation directory; if absent, defaults to `code-semgrep`.
   d. **Expect failure** — the justfile target **must exit non-zero**. If it passes, the project's guardrail failed to catch the violation and the test fails.
   e. **Restore** — put original files back and reset git state for the next test.

This is an inverted test pattern: a passing test means the project's own CI caught the bad code.

**To add a new violation test:**

1. Create a new subdirectory under the target language (for example `violations/python/no-default-values/`).
2. Add only the files that must be overlaid onto the generated project.
3. Optionally add a `check` file containing the justfile recipe name to run (one line, e.g. `code-security`). If omitted, `code-semgrep` is used.
4. Ensure the injected code triggers the intended rule without relying on placeholder/broken syntax.

- Full 3D-game library stack via Conan with exact pins: SDL3, Vulkan (headers/loader/volk/vk-bootstrap/VMA; MoltenVK via brew on macOS), shaderc, SPIRV-Tools/-Cross, GLM, EnTT, Jolt Physics, Recast/Detour, GameNetworkingSockets, bitsery, Opus, miniaudio, tinygltf, meshoptimizer, KTX, ozz-animation, MikkTSpace, Dear ImGui (docking), ImGuizmo, RmlUi, spdlog, fmt, Tracy, SQLite3, libpqxx, zstd, xxHash, GoogleTest

### The React Vite TypeScript Template (`blueprints/react-vite-typescript-base`)

- React + Vite + TypeScript, Node 22+/24+, npm-only tooling
- Two-phase generation: Copier provisions guardrails, then a post-task runs `npm create vite` and merges the scaffold into the project root (nothing frozen — current scaffold and tool versions at every apply; network required)
- Project structure: src/, e2e/, scripts/, data/, config/
- Validation: prettier, oxlint (react-hooks, jsx-a11y, correctness rules), tsc, semgrep, codespell, oxlint security pass (no-eval + correctness), knip, dependency-cruiser, vitest + Testing Library, Playwright, npm audit
- Conventions: Justfile workflow, npm/npx exclusively, no eslint-disable/oxlint-disable, no @ts-ignore, no skipped tests

All templates emphasize creating immediately runnable projects with no placeholders, comprehensive CI pipelines, and AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md files for AI agent guidance.

## Justfile Conventions

These rules apply to all justfiles — in this repository and in all generated templates:

1. **Use `printf` for colored or formatted output** — never `echo` with ANSI escape sequences, as some terminals won't render colors with `echo`. Plain `echo ""` is acceptable only for blank-line spacing.
2. **Add an empty `@echo ""` line before and after each target's command block** to visually separate output between targets.
3. **The `help` target must be a dedicated recipe** with manually written `printf` lines that group related commands and order them by typical execution flow (setup → run → code quality → testing). Never use `just --list` for help output.
4. **The default target (`_default`) must call `just help`.**
5. **Every target must end with a clear status message**: green (`\033[32m`) on success, red (`\033[31m`) on failure with `exit 1`.
6. **Composite targets (e.g. `ci`) must fail fast**: use `set -e` or `&&` chaining to ensure immediate abort on the first error.

## Repository Commands

- `just ci` — Run all repo-level checks (codespell, semgrep, shellcheck) + all template tests
- `just test` — Run baseline + violation tests for all 8 languages
- `just test-<language>` — Run tests for one language (python, java, go, elixir, cpp, rust, kotlin, typescript)
- `just check` — Verify required tools are installed
- `just create <template> <target-dir>` — Scaffold a new project from a blueprint

## Delegating to Sub-Agents

For large implementation tasks, long debugging sessions, or any work that benefits from a dedicated executor, read and follow [DELEGATE.md](DELEGATE.md). It covers how to spin up an isolated Codex sub-agent in a fresh tmux session, send it instructions, monitor its progress, and tear down the session when done. Use delegation whenever a task is substantial enough that running it in a separate agent avoids polluting your main context.

## Landing the Plane (Session Completion)

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds
