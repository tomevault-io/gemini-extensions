# CLAUDE.md — Project Guidance for go-to-production

This file captures project conventions, open goals, and implementation guidance so
that every session (human or AI) stays aligned on what matters.

## Project Overview

A reference implementation that evolves a simple Go todo app into a production-ready
system on Google Cloud Platform. The app code is intentionally minimal — the focus
is on Infrastructure, Security, Observability, and Operational Resilience.

## Repository Layout

```
main.go                  # Entry point — HTTP server, tracing, secrets, DB init
internal/app/app.go      # Core handlers, circuit breaker, retry, metrics, middleware
templates/               # HTML templates (index.html)
static/                  # CSS / JS assets
terraform/               # All GCP infrastructure (GKE, Cloud SQL, IAM, monitoring, …)
k8s/                     # Kubernetes manifests — Kustomize base + region overlays
  base/                  #   Base resources (namespace, service, rollout, HPA, PDB, policies)
  overlays/              #   us-central1 (primary) and us-east1 (secondary) overrides
.github/workflows/       # CI: build-test.yml (build + sign + scan), deploy-pages.yml
scripts/                 # Operational helpers (init-db.sh, generate_cost_chart.py)
test/chaos/              # Chaos / resilience tests (chaos_test.go)
docs/                    # Milestone docs, runbook, strategy, testing guide
```

## Language & Build

- **Go 1.24.4** — standard library `net/http`, no web framework.
- Build: `CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux go build -o server .`
- Tests: `go test -v ./...` (unit + integration + chaos).
- Docker: multi-stage (`golang:1.25-alpine` → `alpine:latest`).

## Conventions

### Git Tags & Milestones
Every milestone gets a tag: `milestone-NN-slug`.
When starting a new milestone:
1. Ensure the *previous* milestone's work is committed to `main`.
2. `git tag milestone-NN-slug` on the commit that completes it.
3. Push the tag: `git push origin milestone-NN-slug`.

### Documentation
- Each milestone has a doc at `docs/NN_TITLE.md`.
- Runbook entries go in `docs/RUNBOOK.md`.
- Risk matrix lives in `docs/STRATEGY_AND_RISKS.md` — update the Status column
  when a risk is mitigated.

### Terraform
- All infra changes go through `terraform/`.
- State is remote in GCS.
- Multi-region resources are parameterized (`variables.tf` region / secondary_region).

### Kubernetes
- Base manifests in `k8s/base/`, region specifics in `k8s/overlays/`.
- Kustomize for composition. Argo Rollouts for canary. ArgoCD for GitOps sync.
- Gatekeeper policies in `k8s/base/policies/`.

### Security
- No secrets in code or git (gitleaks pre-commit hook).
- Cloud SQL uses IAM auth (no passwords in connection path).
- Binary Authorization enforces signed images.
- Cloud Armor WAF protects the ingress.

### Testing
- Unit tests: `main_test.go` (mocked DB, fast).
- Integration tests: `integration_test.go` (real DB via docker-compose).
- Chaos tests: `test/chaos/chaos_test.go` (circuit breaker, failover).
- CI runs unit + chaos on every push; integration on-demand.

### In-Progress: Milestone 13 — Multi-Region

Infrastructure deployed (GKE east, DB replica, MCI, ArgoCD). **Remaining:**
- [ ] Verify DB replication lag and connectivity
- [ ] Application config for region-aware DB routing (writes → primary)
- [ ] DNS: point `todo.smig.dev` A record → `34.160.71.244`
- [ ] Verify traffic routes to nearest region
- [ ] Run failover drill (drain us-central1, validate us-east1 serves traffic)
- [ ] Update RUNBOOK.md to mark region failure as mitigated

## Open Risks — Implementation Roadmap

Six risks from `docs/STRATEGY_AND_RISKS.md` remain unmitigated.
They are addressed across Milestones 14 – 16 below.

### Milestone 14: Operational Resilience (`milestone-14-operational-resilience`)

> Goal: Close the six highest-priority open risks in the risk matrix.

| Risk (Score) | Deliverable |
|--------------|-------------|
| Quota Exhaustion (6) | Terraform: quota usage monitoring alert policies |
| Sensitive Data Leakage (6) | Go: structured log redaction middleware; policy doc |
| Insider Threat (4) | Terraform: VPC-SC / IAM Recommender / audit log sink |
| Backup Restore Failure (4) | Script + CronJob: automated monthly restore drill |
| Ransomware / Corruption (3) | Terraform: GCS bucket lock + retention policies on backups |
| Billing Spike (3) | Terraform: budget alerts + programmatic cap notification |

**Implementation order** (highest score first):
1. Structured logging + PII redaction (app code change — `internal/app/`)
2. Quota monitoring alerts (Terraform — `terraform/alerts.tf`)
3. Budget alerts + billing cap (Terraform — new `terraform/budget.tf`)
4. Automated restore drill (script + k8s CronJob)
5. GCS retention policies (Terraform — `terraform/backup.tf`)
6. Audit log sink + IAM hardening (Terraform — new `terraform/audit.tf`)

**Docs:** `docs/14_OPERATIONAL_RESILIENCE.md`
**Runbook additions:** Quota alert response, backup drill procedure, billing spike response.

### Milestone 15: Advanced Observability (`milestone-15-advanced-observability`)

> Goal: Deep observability, chaos engineering, and incident automation.

| Deliverable | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| Trace ↔ Log correlation | Inject `trace_id` into structured logs; link in Cloud Logging |
| Custom business SLIs | Prometheus counters for domain events (e.g., todo completion rate) |
| Chaos Mesh | Deploy Chaos Mesh to GKE; define experiments (pod-kill, network-delay) |
| Incident response playbooks | Runbook-as-code for PagerDuty / Cloud Monitoring |

**Docs:** `docs/15_ADVANCED_OBSERVABILITY.md`

### Milestone 16: Cost Optimization (`milestone-16-cost-optimization`)

> Goal: Right-size infrastructure and prevent cost surprises.

| Deliverable | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| GKE autoscaling tuning | Evaluate Autopilot or adjust cluster autoscaler settings |
| Cloud SQL right-sizing | Analyze actual usage; downsize or apply CUDs |
| Committed Use Discounts | Evaluate 1-year CUDs for stable workloads |
| Cost anomaly detection | Cloud Billing anomaly alerts; dashboard widget |

**Docs:** `docs/16_COST_OPTIMIZATION.md`

### Milestone 17: Multi-Cloud Active-Active (`milestone-17-multi-cloud`)

> Goal: Survive a total GCP outage with an active-active deployment on AWS.

| Deliverable | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| AWS parallel stack | EKS + Aurora PG via `terraform/aws/` |
| Cross-cloud replication | CDC (Debezium) or PostgreSQL logical replication |
| DNS failover | Cloudflare (external to both clouds) |
| Unified observability | Metrics aggregated across providers |
| Edge delivery | Static assets on Cloudflare Pages/Workers |

**Docs:** `docs/17_MULTI_CLOUD.md`

### Aspirational: Extreme Reliability — Milestones 18–22

> *"The Apollo guidance computer had triple-redundant hardware, N-version
> software, and voting logic. These milestones apply the same philosophy to
> cloud services."*

| # | Milestone | Goal | Key Principle |
|---|-----------|------|---------------|
| 18 | N-Version Redundancy | Survive bugs in your own code | Independent implementations fail independently |
| 19 | Autonomous Self-Healing | MTTR → zero (remove humans from recovery) | If a runbook step can be scripted, automate it |
| 20 | Cell-Based Architecture | Blast radius → 1/N of users | No single failure affects everyone |
| 21 | Formal Verification | Replace "tested" with "proved" | Testing finds bugs; proofs eliminate classes of bugs |
| 22 | Digital Twin | Never deploy an untested change | The DR environment that isn't tested isn't reliable |

**Docs:** `docs/18_EXTREME_RELIABILITY.md`

### The Reliability Ladder

| Level | Availability | What Fails You |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| Regional HA (M3) | ~99.9% | Zone failure |
| Multi-Region (M13) | ~99.99% | Region failure |
| Multi-Cloud (M17) | ~99.999% | Provider failure |
| N-Version (M18) | ~99.9999% | Software bugs |
| Self-Healing (M19) | MTTR → 0 | Human response time |
| Cells (M20) | Blast → 1/N | Correlated failures |
| Formal Verification (M21) | Provable | Incorrect assumptions |
| Digital Twin (M22) | Pre-validated | Untested deployments |

## Working on This Repo

### Before Starting a Milestone
1. Read the milestone doc in `docs/`.
2. Check the risk matrix in `docs/STRATEGY_AND_RISKS.md` — know which risks you are closing.
3. Branch from `main`. Name: `milestone-NN-slug` or feature branches off that.

### When Finishing a Milestone
1. Update `docs/STRATEGY_AND_RISKS.md` — flip Status to ✅ for each mitigated risk.
2. Add runbook entries to `docs/RUNBOOK.md` for any new operational procedure.
3. Update `README.md` milestone table.
4. Commit, tag (`milestone-NN-slug`), push tag.

### Code Quality
- `go vet ./...` and `gosec ./...` must pass.
- Tests must pass: `go test -v ./...`
- No secrets in commits (gitleaks enforced via pre-commit).
- Terraform: `terraform fmt` and `terraform validate` before committing.

### Cost Awareness
Current steady-state is ~$17/day. Multi-region doubles it.
Always note cost impact in milestone docs and PR descriptions.
