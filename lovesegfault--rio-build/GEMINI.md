# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

rio-build is an early-stage Rust project. It uses a Nix flake-based development environment with crate2nix for building Rust packages and protobuf for gRPC code generation.

## Quick Start

The dev environment is managed by Nix. If you have direnv, it activates automatically via `.envrc`.

```bash
# Enter the dev shell (if direnv isn't set up).
# Default shell uses NIGHTLY Rust so cargo-fuzz works; use .#stable for CI parity.
nix develop

# Build
cargo build

# Run
cargo run

# Test (prefer nextest for better output)
cargo nextest run
# or: cargo test

# Single test
cargo nextest run test_name
# or: cargo test test_name

# Lint
cargo clippy --all-targets -- --deny warnings

# Format (uses treefmt: rustfmt + nixfmt + taplo)
treefmt

# Full CI-equivalent checks (clippy, tests, docs, coverage)
nix flake check

# Fuzz a parser (default shell is nightly, so this works directly)
cd rio-nix/fuzz && cargo fuzz run wire_primitives
```

## Build System

- **Nix + crate2nix**: The flake.nix defines the full build pipeline. crate2nix generates per-crate derivations from `Cargo.lock` (JSON output mode — no `Cargo.nix` checked in), giving per-crate caching via nixpkgs' `buildRustCrate`.
- **Cargo workspace**: Root Cargo.toml is a workspace; crates live in subdirectories.
- **Protobuf**: `.proto` files are picked up by the crate2nix source filter. `PROTOC` and `LIBCLANG_PATH` are set automatically in the dev shell.

## Key Commands via Nix

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `nix build` | Build the workspace (release profile with thin LTO) |
| `/nixbuild .#ci` | Full validation: build, clippy, nextest, doc, coverage, pre-commit, 2min fuzz ×9, all VM tests, cov-smoke (Linux+KVM only) |
| `nix flake check` | Runs all `checks.*` (build, clippy, nextest, doc, coverage, 2min fuzz, VM tests) |
| `nix develop .#stable` | Dev shell with stable Rust (CI parity) |
| `nix build .#checks.x86_64-linux.tracey-validate` | Spec-coverage validation (r[...] annotation integrity) |
| `tracey query status` | Spec-coverage summary (in dev shell) |
| `nix fmt` | Same as `treefmt` |
| `/nixbuild .#coverage-full` | Combined unit+VM coverage (lcov+HTML, ~25min, needs KVM) |
| `nix build .#cov-smoke` | Fast (~5min) one-scenario coverage-infra smoke (also in `.#ci`) |
| `/nixbuild .#cov-vm-protocol-warm-standalone` | Run one VM test in coverage mode (debugging, raw profraws at `result/coverage/`) |
| `nix build .#coverage-vm-protocol-warm-standalone` | Per-test lcov from one coverage-mode VM run |

### CI aggregate target

`/nixbuild .#ci` bundles all checks + VM tests + 2min fuzz into a single build. Needs KVM for the VM tests. On non-Linux, degrades to cargo checks + pre-commit only (VM tests and fuzz are both Linux-only). Result is a directory of symlinks to each constituent's output (`ls result/`).

### Coverage

Three tiers:

- **Unit-test only** (~5min): `nix build .#checks.x86_64-linux.coverage`. Output: `result/lcov.info`. HTML via `nix build .#coverage-html`.
- **Cov-smoke** (~5min, in `.#ci`): `nix build .#cov-smoke`. One representative VM scenario in coverage mode, asserts profraw→lcov pipeline produced non-empty data. Catches "coverage infrastructure broken" at merge-gate. A PSA break went 118 commits undetected before this was added — coverage-full failures were triaged as individual test-gaps instead of a pipeline-level halt.
- **Combined unit+VM** (~25min, needs KVM): `/nixbuild .#coverage-full`. Output: `result/lcov.info` (combined), `result/html/`, `result/per-test/vm-<scenario>-<fixture>.lcov`. Fills the ~15% "permanently red" gap of VM-only code (FUSE callbacks, namespace setup, cgroup tracking, main.rs wiring, k8s lease/reconcilers, SSH accept loop). **Not** in `.#ci` — run on demand.

VM coverage architecture details: see `.claude/rules/coverage.md` (loads when editing `nix/coverage.nix`).

## Formatting

treefmt runs three formatters:
- **rustfmt** for `.rs` files
- **nixfmt** for `.nix` files
- **taplo** for `.toml` files

Pre-commit hooks run treefmt automatically on commit.

## Development Notes

- Rust edition is **2024** — use latest Rust idioms and features.
- Clippy is configured with `--deny warnings` — all warnings must be fixed.
- The `target/` directory is gitignored; Nix builds go to `result`/`result-*` (also gitignored).
- Integration tests may need `nix` available in PATH (it's provided in the dev shell).
- **Default dev shell uses nightly Rust** so `cargo fuzz` works directly. CI builds (clippy, nextest, workspace) use stable via `rust-toolchain.toml` — nightly-only code will be rejected by `nix flake check`. Use `nix develop .#stable` for CI-parity development.
- **Always run cargo commands via `nix develop -c`** to ensure all dev shell dependencies (including fuse3) are available. E.g., `nix develop -c cargo nextest run`, `nix develop -c cargo clippy --all-targets -- --deny warnings`.
- **Always run `nix develop -c cargo nextest run` before committing** to catch regressions early.
- PostgreSQL integration tests bootstrap their own ephemeral postgres server (via `rio-test-support`) using `initdb`/`postgres` binaries from the dev shell. **No manual setup needed.** Tests panic (not skip) if postgres binaries are unavailable. Set `DATABASE_URL` to override with an external PG for debugging.
- Use semantic commit messages scoped by crate (e.g., `feat(rio-nix): add ATerm derivation parser`).
- **tracey MCP (optional):** `nix develop -c tracey ai --claude` registers the tracey MCP server + installs the annotation skill. After registration, Claude Code can query `tracey_uncovered` / `tracey_untested` / `tracey_rule` during dev sessions. The daemon caches scan results — `rm -rf .tracey/` to force rescan.

### Migration files are frozen after they ship

`sqlx::migrate!()` checksums `.sql` files by content (SHA-384 over the full file body, including comments). Editing a comment changes the checksum → persistent-DB deploys fail with `VersionMismatch`.

- **Commentary, rationale, history:** goes in `rio-store/src/migrations.rs` (per-migration `M_NNN` doc-consts). NOT in the `.sql`.
- **New migration:** add the SQL, run `cargo test -p rio-store --test migrations`, copy the hex-SHA from the `unpinned migration NNN` panic into `PINNED` at `rio-store/tests/migrations.rs`, commit both.
- **Behavior change to a shipped migration:** write a NEW migration. Never edit shipped ones. The checksum-freeze test (`migration_checksums_frozen`) fails CI on any content change.

## CI gate

**Every change MUST pass `.#ci` before merge.** This is the single gate — it covers build, clippy, nextest, docs, coverage, pre-commit, 2min fuzz, and all VM tests. "Done but CI red" is not done.

From agent/subagent context, prefer `/nixbuild .#ci` over raw `nix build` — it captures the log to `/tmp/rio-dev/` and emits a JSON report instead of streaming megabytes of build output. For interactive debugging, plain `nix build -L .#ci` is fine.

When `.#ci` is red and the cause isn't obvious from the log, see `.claude/rules/ci-failure-patterns.md` — it catalogs every failure signature that has bitten this project before.

## Fuzzing

Fuzz targets live in per-crate `fuzz/` workspaces (excluded from the main workspace, separate `Cargo.lock` each). Currently: `rio-nix/fuzz/` (protocol/wire parsers) and `rio-store/fuzz/` (manifest parser). The default dev shell is nightly, so `cargo fuzz` works without extra setup:

```bash
nix develop -c bash -c 'cd rio-nix/fuzz && cargo fuzz run wire_primitives'
nix develop -c bash -c 'cd rio-store/fuzz && cargo fuzz run manifest_deserialize'
```

CI equivalent:
```bash
nix build .#checks.x86_64-linux.fuzz-wire_primitives  # 2min, in flake check
```

When adding a new parser, also add a fuzz target:
1. Add a `[[bin]]` entry in the relevant `fuzz/Cargo.toml` + target file in `fuzz_targets/`
2. Add seed inputs to `fuzz/corpus/<target>/` (must be prefixed `seed-`; NAR seeds: see `gen-nar-corpus.sh`)
3. Add the target to `fuzzTargets` in `nix/fuzz.nix` (target name + which `fuzzBuild` + `corpusRoot`)
4. If the fuzzed crate's deps changed, run `cargo xtask regen fuzz-lock` (fuzz lockfiles are independent of the main workspace)

## Design Book

This project has a comprehensive design book in `docs/src/`. When implementing a feature, cross-reference ALL relevant design docs:

- **Component specs** (`docs/src/components/`): Protocol details, API contracts
- **Observability spec** (`docs/src/observability.md`): Metric names, log format, tracing structure
- **Crate structure** (`docs/src/crate-structure.md`): Expected modules and file layout
- **Architecture** (`docs/src/architecture.md`): System-level design

### Keeping docs and code in sync

When implementation reveals that a design doc is wrong (e.g., the spec says u32 but the real protocol uses u64), update the design doc in the same commit that fixes the code. Don't let them drift.

### Spec traceability (tracey)

Normative requirements in `docs/src/` are marked with `r[domain.area.detail]` standalone paragraphs. Code that implements a requirement carries `// r[impl domain.area.detail]`; tests carry `// r[verify …]`. The CI check `tracey-validate` fails on broken references.

| Command | Use |
|---|---|
| `tracey query uncovered` | Spec rules with no `impl` annotation — unimplemented features |
| `tracey query untested` | Spec rules with `impl` but no `verify` — missing test coverage |
| `tracey query rule <id>` | See spec text + all impl/verify sites for one rule |
| `tracey query validate` | CI check — structural violations (e.g. `r[impl]` in test_include file); exits nonzero on error |
| `tracey query status` | Overall coverage summary |
| `tracey bump` | Bump version of staged requirements whose text changed (marks existing annotations stale) |

**When adding spec text that describes a new behavior or constraint:** add an `r[...]` marker (standalone paragraph, blank line before, col 0), then annotate the implementing code with `// r[impl ...]` and the test with `// r[verify ...]`. The marker-first discipline means `tracey query uncovered` surfaces unimplemented spec requirements immediately.

**VM-test `r[verify]` placement:** for NixOS VM tests under `nix/tests/`, place `# r[verify ...]` markers in `default.nix` at the `subtests = [...]` entry that wires the fragment — NOT in the scenario file's col-0 header block. A marker in a scenario header tells tracey the rule is tested; it does not tell tracey the fragment runs. A marker at the subtests entry structurally couples the two: no wiring → no marker → tracey catches it.

```nix
subtests = [
  # r[verify store.gc.tenant-retention]
  "gc-sweep"
  # r[verify builder.upload.references-scanned]
  # r[verify builder.upload.deriver-populated]
  # r[verify store.gc.two-phase]
  "refs-end-to-end"
];
```

Scenario-file header blocks MAY keep prose descriptions of what each marker covers (useful for humans); they MUST NOT carry the marker token itself. `config.styx`'s `test_include` is narrowed to `nix/tests/default.nix` only, so a stray marker in a scenario file is invisible to tracey — the rule stays listed as untested until properly wired.

**When spec text changes meaningfully:** run `tracey bump` before committing. This version-bumps the marker (e.g., `r[gw.opcode.foo]` → `r[gw.opcode.foo+2]`), making existing `r[impl gw.opcode.foo]` annotations stale until someone reviews and bumps them.

### Deferred work

Mark deferred work with a plain `// TODO:` comment that says *what* and *why* in enough detail that someone else could pick it up. Mark explicit non-goals with `// WONTFIX:` and the rationale inline. Existing `TODO(P0NNN)`/`WONTFIX(P0NNN)` tags reference historical plan docs; the plan number is archaeology — `git log -S P0NNN` finds the relevant commits.

## Protocol Implementation Guidelines

See `.claude/rules/protocol-wire.md` (loads when editing `rio-gateway/src/**` or `rio-nix/src/{protocol,wire}/**`).

## Observability Checklist

When adding metrics or tracing, verify end-to-end — don't just initialize the exporter:

- Metrics are actually **registered** (not just the exporter)
- Metric names match `observability.md` naming conventions (`rio_{component}_`)
- Gauges are decremented on cleanup (connection close, session end)
- Default log format is JSON, not pretty-printed
- Handlers have `#[instrument]` spans with meaningful fields
- Root span includes `component` field per structured logging spec
