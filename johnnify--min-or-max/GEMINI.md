# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a monorepo for "Min or Max", a multiplayer card game where you lay low or play it to the max!

The web application serves as its own marketing site, and includes the game itself, utilising Cloudflare features for real-time play. Built with SvelteKit and modern web technologies.

Locally, the dev server is always running at http://localhost:5173/

## Coding Standards

- **Strongly typed**: Consistently use type aliases for all object type definitions
- You MUST type things accurately. Don't be lazy.
- You must NOT use the `any` type, or similarly lazy ways out.
- **You MUST design for a single source of truth**: DO NOT hardcode strings and arrays when data can be derived.
- **NEVER** try format code or check for whitespace yourself. Use your Write & Edit tools properly. We have a dedicated formatter you may use at the end of your tasks.
- It will **NEVER** be a formatting issue.
- You must **NEVER** over-indulge with comments! If you find yourself writing comments, stop and think whether a better variable or function name would make the code clearer instead.
- You must **NEVER** write comments which only explain the following line of code!

## Architecture

### Monorepo Structure

- `apps/web/` - Main SvelteKit application
- `apps/api/` - Cloudflare Worker using Durable Objects to communicate game state
- `packages/state/` - State shared by web & server apps
- `packages/rng/` - Utility for seeded randomness that can run on the server or browser

## Development Commands

All commands should be run from the repository root:

- `pnpm dev` - Start all development servers in watch mode
- `pnpm build` - Build all apps for production
- `pnpm test` - Run all tests (requires dev servers running)
- `pnpm lint` - Lint all code
- `pnpm format` - Format all code with Prettier

## Web App (apps/web/)

### Web App Specific Commands

From `apps/web/` directory:

- `pnpm test:unit` - Run Vitest unit tests
- `pnpm test` - Run all Playwright tests
- `pnpm check` - Type check with svelte-check

### Tech Stack

- **Framework**: SvelteKit with Svelte 5 (Runes)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4 + `shadcn-svelte` components
- **Testing**: Playwright (e2e/integration), Vitest (unit)
- **Icons**: Unplugin Icons
- **Deployment**: Cloudflare Workers

### Key Directories

- `src/lib/components/` - Reusable Svelte components
- `src/routes/` - SvelteKit file-based routing
- `tests/` - Playwright test suites

### Testing Strategy

- **Playwright**: e2e and integration tests, run with dev servers
- **Vitest**: Unit tests, can run independently

You MUST start Playwright specs / tests by navigating to a page, then:

```ts
await expect(page.getByTestId('hydrated')).toBeVisible()
```

This ensures our app is fully interactive.

Prefer tests that tell a bigger story: Have the "user" (as Playwright) interact with the application for a realistic flow.

#### Example

Test the happy path in a single test:

- "I expect to see this", then "I type this", then "I click this", then "I expect to see this"
- AVOID individual tests for a single action "I expect to see this"

#### Meaningful tests

Even the Vitest tests have to be meaningful!

**NEVER write tests that only verify types or function existence**. TypeScript already guarantees these at compile time. Tests MUST verify actual behaviour, logic, edge cases, or integration points.

Examples of USELESS tests to NEVER write:

- `expect(typeof someFunction).toBe('function')` - TypeScript already checks this
- `expect(someFunction).toBeDefined()` - TypeScript already checks this
- `expect(someObject).toHaveProperty('field')` - TypeScript already checks this

If you have to write a unit test, it must answer: "What bug would this catch that TypeScript can't?"

EVERY test should have a realistic to see fail.

### Environment Setup

- Use pnpm as package manager
- Node.js 25 required (managed by Mise)

### Tailwind CSS v4 Configuration

- **No tailwind.config file**: Tailwind v4 does not use a traditional config file
- **CSS-based configuration**: All Tailwind configuration is done in CSS files
- **Main config location**: `apps/web/src/app.css` contains the Tailwind configuration
- **Theme customization**: Custom colors, fonts, and utilities are defined in `app.css` using `@theme` blocks
- **Use `cn` utility**: Import from `$lib/utils` for conditional class application with proper merging
- **Prefer Tailwind classes**: Always use Tailwind utility classes instead of inline styles or custom CSS in `<style>` blocks when possible

### Vanilla HTML forms

Always prefer web standards, including using the `form` element for GET actions like filtering and pagination, and POST actions like updating a record.

**Use SvelteKit Remote Functions `form`** with Zod: the SvelteKit philosophy respects web standards and falls back to native form behaviour even when JavaScript is disabled, and also increase DevEx thanks to strong typing.

### TypeScript Coding Standards

- **Always use `type` over `interface`**: Prefer `type Props = {}` instead of `interface Props {}`
- **Function declarations**: Prefer arrow functions `const someMethod = () => {}` over function declarations `function someMethod() {}`
- No `console.log`s committed in the code! You may use them for debugging purposes, but only use `console.info`, `console.warn`, `console.error` appropriately for code meant to remain in the codebase.
- **Performance measurement**: Always use `performance.now()` instead of `Date.now()` for timing operations. The Performance API provides high-resolution timestamps (microsecond precision) specifically designed for performance measurement, whereas `Date.now()` is lower resolution and intended for timestamps.
- **NEVER explicitly use `undefined`**. If you have to assign a value, use `null` instead. NEVER call a method like `antiPattern(undefined)`. You may use `antiPattern()`
- As an LLM, you have difficulty telling curly apostrophes and straight apostrophes apart. **NEVER** try to change any type of code to another. If you think something is not compiling, you MUST ask the user for clarification.
- If you add a new dependency, you **MUST** `pnpm up -r --latest` to confirm all dependencies are up to their latest versions.

## QA

0. NEVER try to run the server yourself, NEVER check whether we are in a git repo. You MUST assume we are running the dev server on a different window, and http://localhost:5173 is reachable, interactive and serving our app. You MUST assume we are already in a git monorepo.
1. At the end of a task where you changed or added code, you MUST ensure `pnpm check` runs successfully at the root of the project.
2. At the end of a task where you changed or added code, you MUST ensure `pnpm build` runs successfully at the root of the project.
3. At the end of a task where you changed or added code, you MUST ensure `pnpm test` runs successfully at the root of the project.
4. At the end of a task where you changed or added code, you MUST ensure `pnpm lint` runs successfully at the root of the project.
5. At the end of a task where you changed or added code, you MUST ensure any related spec or test files are updated. This includes Playwright `.spec.ts` files and Vitest `.test.ts` files.

You may spawn agents to run these tasks in parallel.

# Svelte MCP server

You are able to use the Svelte MCP server, where you have access to comprehensive Svelte 5 and SvelteKit documentation. Here's how to use the available tools effectively:

## Available MCP Tools:

### 1. list-sections

Use this FIRST to discover all available documentation sections. Returns a structured list with titles, use_cases, and paths.
When asked about Svelte or SvelteKit topics, ALWAYS use this tool at the start of the chat to find relevant sections.

### 2. get-documentation

Retrieves full documentation content for specific sections. Accepts single or multiple sections.
After calling the list-sections tool, you MUST analyze the returned documentation sections (especially the use_cases field) and then use the get-documentation tool to fetch ALL documentation sections that are relevant for the user's task.

### 3. svelte-autofixer

Analyzes Svelte code and returns issues and suggestions.
You MUST use this tool whenever writing Svelte code before sending it to the user.
You MUST keep calling it until no issues or suggestions are returned UNLESS they are about experimental features. For example, ignore issue about top-level `await` or Svelte Remote Functions, since they are explicitly enabled in `apps/web/svelte.config.js`.

### 4. playground-link

Generates a Svelte Playground link with the provided code.
After completing the code, ask the user if they want a playground link. Only call this tool after user confirmation and NEVER if code was written to files in their project.

## Project-specific notes

### Creating new routes and page metadata

If you've created a new route, make sure you have added a corresponding `+page.server.ts`.

Every route needs one with, at the very least, an exported `load` method returning an object with a `meta` key. For example, at minimum we should have a `+page.server.ts` like this:

```ts
import type {PageServerLoad} from './$types'

export const load: PageServerLoad = async () => ({
	meta: {
		title: '[THE ROUTE TITLE]',
		description: '[A LONG ACCURATE DESCRIPTION FOR SEO BEST PRACTICES]',
	},
})
```

# Cloudflare Documentation MCP server

Get up to date reference information on Cloudflare.

Use this when researching ways to accomplish a task with automation or infrastructure.

Also use this when debugging an issue that seems to work locally, but not when deployed to Cloudflare.

## Available Cloudflare Documentation MCP Tools:

### 1. search_cloudflare_documentation

**Description:** Search the Cloudflare documentation.

#### Prompt Examples

- `Do Cloudflare Workers costs depend on response sizes? I want to serve some images (map tiles) from an R2 bucket and I'm concerned about costs.`
- `How many indexes are supported in Workers Analytics Engine? Give an example using the Workers binding api.`
- `Can you give me some information on how to use the Workers AutoRAG binding`

### Playwright MCP Server

At the end of writing user-facing code, you MUST use the Playwright MCP Server to confirm the UX is as expected. You MUST keep using it until all issues are resolved.

You MUST Playwright's accessibility tree to navigate the DOM. **NEVER** take screenshots.

When writing Playwright tests / specs, you MUST use the Playwright MCP server to confirm we are using the correct Locators / selectors.

You MUST use accessible Locators. NEVER use test ids: no `data-testid` in the source code, no `getByTestId` in the tests.

AVOID writing source code just for tests.

When writing tests NEVER `waitForTimeout`. Playwright assertions have built-in waits, there must always be a better way than an explicitly waiting.

When evaluating page performance, you MUST consider the Core Web Vitals. Layout Shift is unacceptable. Prevent it with common techniques like specifying width and height on images.
