# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Status: Bootstrap Phase

PitWay is being built here, and **PitWay is developed using its own workflow** (dogfooding). The authoritative sources are the workflow state in `.pitway/` (milestones, contracts, backlog) — the original design record is archived at `docs/archive/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN-v1.0.md` (frozen; never updated).

- Milestones M001–M003 follow the **manual PitWay protocol**: milestone/contract/task artifacts are hand-authored in `.pitway/` following schema v1, commits carry `PitWay-Milestone:` / `PitWay-Task:` trailers, and TDD + atomic-commit rules apply from the first commit. From M004 onward, PitWay manages its own development.
- **Never write implementation code outside a confirmed milestone task.** A milestone's contract must be presented to the developer and explicitly approved in conversation before its baseline commit or any task work.
- Check `.pitway/state.yaml` and the active milestone's `contract.md` / `tasks.yaml` to find current state and next work before doing anything.

There is no build tooling until M001's scaffold task lands. Once `package.json` exists: TypeScript strict / Node ≥ 20 / ESM, `vitest` for tests, runtime deps limited to `commander` + `yaml` + `zod`, MIT license. Add the real commands here at that point.

## What PitWay Is

An npm-distributed CLI (`npx pitway init`; unscoped package name `pitway`) that controls the engineering *process* around AI coding agents — it is not itself an agent. Core philosophy: **"Claude drives the interaction; PitWay controls the workflow state and engineering boundaries."**

Pipeline: Requirement → Milestone → Contract → human confirmation → verification plan → right-sized task graph → task-level TDD (RED→GREEN→REFACTOR) → verification → atomic commit → milestone contract verification → completion.

Non-goals: not a multi-agent framework, coding agent, PM SaaS, CI/CD platform, database-backed orchestration service, or web dashboard.

## Architecture Constraints (binding on all code)

- **Layering**: `CLI → Core → State Store (.pitway/) + Git module`. Claude Code is the primary driver via slash commands, but **the driver never touches `.pitway/` directly** — every state read and mutation goes through a CLI command, and Core validates every transition. This is the load-bearing rule that keeps Core agent-agnostic.
- **Core must never import AI-provider code.** Claude-specific material is text assets only (`src/integrations/claude/`), installed by `pitway init` (default on, `--no-claude` opt-out). Additional drivers may ship as text-asset integrations only, under src/integrations/<driver>/, sharing common assets from src/integrations/common/ via a static, hardcoded common-to-override lookup — never a runtime-loaded plugin system, never dynamic driver registration, never a Core code change, never AI-provider code inside Core.
- **State**: plain files in repo-local `.pitway/` (committed to git), schema v1 with `schema_version: 1` in every file. `contract.md` frontmatter is machine-authoritative (ACs, verification checks, status); the markdown body holds prose and the append-only Change Log. Verification *results* live separately in `verification-results.yaml`. One authoritative source per fact; no derived git data (SHAs) persisted — resolve from commit trailers.
- **Naming**: the racing metaphor (🏁 📜 🛠 🏎 🧪 🔧) is presentation-only, allowed in CLI output. All identifiers, schemas, files, and state values use engineering vocabulary — `status: in_progress`, never `status: racing`.
- **Task states**: `planned → waiting → ready → in_progress → review → completed`, plus `in_progress → blocked → ready`, `in_progress → failed → ready`, `planned|waiting|ready → cancelled`. Milestone states: `draft → confirmed → in_progress → review → completed`, `review → in_progress` on failed verification, `draft|confirmed → cancelled`. No micro-states.

## Key Operational Rules

- **Contract is the execution boundary**: never silently expand scope. A discovered conflict stops work, proposes a contract change (append-only Change Log entry), and waits for developer approval (`milestone-confirm --amend` re-approves).
- **Git safety**: clean working tree required at task *start* (stop and ask on dirty — never auto-stash/reset/absorb). One atomic commit per verified task containing code + same-task state update, with `PitWay-Milestone:` / `PitWay-Task:` trailers; message follows repo convention. Commit messages carry **only** PitWay traceability trailers — never agent/provider session metadata (`Claude-Session:`, `Co-Authored-By: Claude`, `Codex-Session:`, etc.); git history stays provider-agnostic, and workflow state or resume behavior must never depend on an AI conversation or session identifier. Baseline commit at milestone confirmation. Never commit RED states, retries, or intermediate edits. No branches/worktrees/stashes/merges; sequential execution in MVP.
- **Human gate**: `milestone-confirm` runs only after explicit developer approval in the conversation.
- **Verification**: three check types — `command`, `manual`, `review` — defined in contract frontmatter, each mapped to an acceptance criterion. Commands are approved at confirmation via `verification_approved_hash`; `verify` refuses on hash mismatch. Never execute unapproved agent-authored commands.
- **Context isolation**: task subagents receive only the generated task-context bundle (task definition, acceptance criteria, contract excerpt, dependency results, relevant files, verification instructions) — never full milestone history. Results persisted as concise structured summaries, never transcripts.
- **Token accounting**: record only runtime-reported usage, never estimate (`usage: null` → `N/A`); accumulate across retries; planning/QA usage separate from task usage; never double-count. Same honesty for progress: no per-task percentages — milestone progress is `completed required tasks / total required tasks`.
- **Design priority order**: correctness > simplicity > predictability > recoverability > developer clarity > token efficiency > observability > extensibility > parallelism > feature count.

## Testing

Vitest, three tiers: unit (pure Core: state machines, dependency resolution, progress calc, usage aggregation, contract parsing, git safety logic), integration (real temp git repos, CLI end-to-end), and one end-to-end simulated milestone plus failure / blocked-dependency / resume / contract-change / dirty-tree / missing-usage cases. PitWay's own tasks use task-level TDD where appropriate.

## Response Style

Be concise by default.

- Lead with the outcome or current status.
- Do not repeat the request or narrate routine steps.
- Report only: changes, verification results, commit SHA, blockers, and decisions needed.
- Use short bullets; avoid long explanations unless requested.
- Keep progress updates to 1–3 sentences.
- Put necessary detail in contracts/docs, not chat summaries.
- When presenting a contract for approval, provide the complete contract.
- Expand only when ambiguity, risk, or a design decision requires explanation.
