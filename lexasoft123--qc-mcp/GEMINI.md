> MCP server that controls a **Neural DSP Quad Cortex** over its reverse-engineered

# CLAUDE.md

MCP server that controls a **Neural DSP Quad Cortex** over its reverse-engineered
internal **USB-HID / protobuf** protocol (not MIDI). See `PROTOCOL.md` for the wire
protocol, `docs/DIRECTORY.md` for the preset/capture/IR catalog + scenes,
and `docs/COROS-4.1.md` for the 4.1 feature set (device presets, stomps,
Global EQ / I/O presets) with usage examples.
Supports **CorOS 4.0 and 4.1** — the schema is picked per connection from the
device's firmware (PROTOCOL.md §12) — on **macOS and Windows** (`docs/WINDOWS.md`).

## Layout
- `src/qc_mcp/`
  - `backend.py` — picks the HID transport for the OS (`open_hid`) and answers
    `direct_supported`/`bridge_supported`. All three backends below implement the
    same four methods: `open`/`set_report`/`read_reports`/`close`.
  - `iohid.py` — **macOS**: ctypes IOKit HID transport (input buffer must be
    report_size+1).
  - `winhid.py` — **Windows**: ctypes setupapi + hid.dll. Overlapped I/O; picks
    the collection with 129-byte reports; raises the driver's 32-report input
    queue to 512 (a directory dump overruns the default).
  - `bridge.py` — FIFO bridge: share Cortex Control's live session via the DYLD
    interposer (run MCP + the app at once). No handshake/heartbeat (the app owns them).
    **macOS only** — importing it elsewhere raises with that message.
  - `protocol.py` — framing (128-byte reports, flag bits, 8-byte command trailer,
    gzip), `COMMANDS`, encode/decode, `Reassembler`; **version negotiation**
    (`generation`/`set_version`/`supports`/`require`) + a descriptor pool per CorOS
    generation from `descriptors/qc_descriptors-<gen>.pb`.
  - `transport.py` — `QuadCortex`: open/handshake/heartbeat, read state, edit grid
    (add/delete block, params, per-scene params, splits/mixers, routing, bypass,
    captures, IRs), recall/save, list_directory.
  - `catalog.py` — `ModelRepo.xml` parser + value taper (log/linear, `to_norm`/
    `to_display`). `SYMBOLIC` resolves the ranges the XML leaves as names
    (`MIN_MIXER_DB` = -40, `MAX_MIXER_DB` = +12, calibrated against the app —
    only add a name once measured). Data attribution: neuraldsp.com/device-list.
  - `preset.py` — `describe(bp)` ⇄ `build(spec)` + `apply_spec` (spec ⇄ BinaryPreset).
  - `directory.py` — structure/search the on-device catalog (presets/IRs/captures).
    A file's slot is its **array position** (the `index` field is 0 in a whole
    read), so a setlist's 256 entries map straight to recall positions.
  - `leveling.py` — the preset-leveling bench Patchbay's Leveling view drives
    (`qc-mcp --leveling --socket …`, newline-JSON on stdio, attaches to the
    daemon like any other client). Reads/writes LaneOutputControl VOLUME in dB
    and streams `IOMeter`.
  - `server.py` — FastMCP server (~30 tools). `connect(mode=auto|bridge|direct)`:
    when nothing is running it RETURNS the mode options (relay the question to the
    user); `mode='bridge'` self-launches `interceptor/run-bridge.sh` (~20s cold) and
    joins; `mode='direct'` needs `quit_app=True` if Cortex Control holds the device.
    Other tools' `_conn()` still auto-detects a running bridge. Where bridge mode
    can't run, `auto` goes straight to direct instead of asking.
- `interceptor/` — DYLD interposer C + build/run scripts (capture + bridge). Logs and
  `catalog.json` are **gitignored** (contain library names / session ids).
- `tools/` — RE utilities (mostly macOS: they shell out to otool/codesign);
  `tools/win_hid_check.py` diagnoses a Windows setup (enumerate → open → round-trip,
  distinct exit codes per failure). `tools/gui/` — GUI-automation harness (below).
  After a CorOS update run all three: `interceptor/build.sh` (re-instrument the
  updated app), `tools/build_descriptors.py build <gen>` (new wire schema),
  `tools/dump_model_repo.py --diff` then without `--diff` (new device catalog).
- `.claude/skills/` — reusable reverse-engineering skills.

## Running
- `python3` alone lacks pyobjc; use `.venv/bin/python`. GUI tools auto-reexec into `.venv`.
- Tests (all offline, no device): `.venv/bin/python tests/test_directory.py`,
  `tests/test_protocol_versions.py`, `tests/test_tool_docs.py` (keeps the MCP
  self-describing — every gated feature must have a tool behind it),
  `tests/test_platform.py` (keeps the macOS and Windows backends interchangeable;
  it's the only check on `winhid.py` from a Mac).
- Device/GUI tools need the instrumented Cortex Control running (bridge) — see
  `interceptor/run-bridge.sh`.

## GUI harness + tests (`tools/gui/`)
Drives Cortex Control (screenshot + click) and correlates the interposer protocol log.
Needs **Claude.app** granted Screen Recording + Accessibility (macOS TCC).
**Capture and reads no longer touch the screen:** `shot` uses `screencapture -l
<winid>` (renders that window alone, occluded or parked off-screen), and `ax`
reads JUCE's accessibility tree — labelled controls, live values, exact frames,
no focus. Only clicking needs the screen (JUCE ignores AXPress and
CGEventPostToPid): `press "<name>"` borrows focus for ~1s and hands it back.
`park`/`home` move the window off every display and back.
- `gui.py` — `bounds`/`home`/`shot`/`click`/`type`/`key`/`act`/`decode`. **`home`
  first** — clicks only map on the main Retina display (see `drive-gui-correlate-protocol`).
- `mine_log.py` / `dump_catalog.py` — decode captured traffic, build a catalog snapshot.
- `sweep_presets.py` — load every preset in a folder, check the decoder handles it.
- `roundtrip_test.py [--device]` — deep golden round-trip over real presets (every field).
- `e2e_test.py` — prompt → built chain → assert. `test_fender_scenes.py` — scenes demo.

## Gotchas (bite you if forgotten)
- **The Quad Cortex Mini is a second USB product id** (`0x892F`; the full QC is
  `0x880A`) on the same VID, same HID interface 5, same 129-byte reports, same
  protobuf schema — it just reports `Version.device_type` `ATMA` instead of `QC`.
  `backend.QC_PIDS` is the one list of the family; both transports and the app
  match all of it. Never hardcode a single pid — that is what made a plugged-in
  Mini show "No Quad Cortex found on USB". Verified on Win10 + CorOS 4.0.1.
- **Read vs delta indexing**: in a full read, array *position* is the index; the id/
  column/index *fields* are 0. In edits, set the fields. `apply_spec` uses position.
- **Grid whole-preset UPDATE merges** (doesn't replace) — build incrementally / clear first.
  And **`clear_grid` needs working reads** (it deletes what it reads); if reads are dead it
  clears nothing and the next build merges onto stale state (ghost/duplicate blocks).
- **Bridge reads are reliable now** (were flaky). Fixed in `bridge.py`/`transport.py`:
  out FIFO is **O_RDWR** (reader never hits EOF when the app blinks) + **self-healing**
  reader thread; reads correlate on **`request_id`** (device echoes it; our ids use a high
  base to dodge the app's). Streamed telemetry (CPULoad) is `request_id=0` broadcast → take
  the **latest**, not the first buffered. If a session goes stale, `disconnect`→`connect`
  revives it (`get_current_preset` also auto-reconnects+retries once).
- **Saving = File CREATE, never RecallPreset SAVE.** The app saves via `File{action=CREATE,
  folder{key, files{index=<position>, name}}}` (cmd 4, **no** preset_payload — device commits
  its live working grid). *RecallPreset UPDATE reason=SAVE* **hangs the device** on an empty/
  Unsaved slot (needs a reboot). `save_preset`/`save_preset_as` now both use File CREATE.
  Success string ≠ commit: verify via `current_preset_position` + app header name w/o `*`.
- **`add_block` de-dupes**: re-adding a hash already on that row is a no-op — to move a
  block, delete first (or use a different hash). Verify every build (read `split_points` +
  screenshot); orphaned amps still draw CPU but make no sound.
- **Routing/parallel** (see `build-preset-routing` skill): `in=1`/`out=19`(Multi Out)/
  `out=16`(mix bus); split `{split_col,mix_col}` is **1→2** (nest for 3+ amps via a relay
  row). Split **after** shared blocks (`split_col` = first non-shared column). Post-merge
  FX go **after `mix_col`**. Stereo = **pan branch lanes** (LaneOutputControl PAN=idx 1;
  0=L,.5=C,1=R) — not the output row. Directory: the live listing (one `File` READ →
  device streams the whole catalog, ~12s) **works in bridge mode too** — on a fresh
  clone just call `directory_summary(refresh=True)`; it auto-saves the gitignored
  `interceptor/catalog.json` snapshot (fallback for interrupted reads; the tools return
  this hint when `source == "empty"`). `run-bridge.sh` now sets `QC_VERBOSE=1` so the
  frame log the GUI tools need is always written.
- **Param values are a oneof** (int/float/string); preserve the active field (`preset._pv`,
  `set_param_typed`) or string params (cab mic names, capture `file_name`, IR path) drop.
- **Per-scene param**: assign to scenes (`params{index, scene_mode:true}`, no values), then
  per scene set active scene + write a plain value — it lands on the active scene.
- **Per-scene bypass** = assign the block's **bypass param** to scenes
  (`params{index:N, scene_mode:true}`), then per scene set the active scene and send a
  PLAIN bypass map entry with ONE `sceneBypass` flag — the same two steps a per-scene
  param needs, and exactly what the app emits (captured off its right-click "Assign to
  Scenes"). `N` is **one past the block's last readable param** — `len(model.params)`
  from a device read, NOT the catalog count: ModelRepo declares 2 params for cabsim
  12013 and the device reports 22. `transport.bypass_param_index()` is the one place
  that decides it. This was hardcoded to **4** for a long time, which is a real knob on
  anything but a 4-slot block (VOLUME on a Neural Capture, TONE CUT on UK C30 TopBoost,
  LOW PASS on Tape Delay) — and that, not anything about trails, is the whole of the old
  "silent no-op on Delay blocks" note. Verified on amp/reverb/capture/cabsim/delay/IR.
  **`colBypass.sceneMode` is read-only**: writes are ignored and the device takes only
  the FIRST `sceneBypass` flag as a plain bypass, so an 8-flag message sets all 8 the
  same. Only the param assign flips it. And **scene switches must be confirmed** (Scene
  READ) before writing a scene value — a fixed sleep races the device and drops values
  (`_await_scene`).
- **Scene labels/colors = dedicated `SceneLabel`(23)/`SceneColor`(48) UPDATEs** `{index,
  label|color}` — a Grid UPDATE with preset-level `scene_labels[]` is a silent no-op.
  Preset **name** is set by the save (File CREATE), not settable on the live grid.
  Unlabeled scenes with data show "Undefined" on-device.
- **The instrumented copy must keep the ORIGINAL's entitlements.** `build.sh`
  reads them off the source app now and adds only the four injection needs on
  top; it used to carry a hand-written "from the original app" list that had
  drifted and was silently dropping `automation.apple-events` and
  `scripting-targets`. It verifies nothing was lost, so the drift cannot come
  back quietly. Use **PlistBuddy, not plutil**, to add these keys: plutil reads
  `.` as a key-PATH separator, so `com.apple.security.cs.*` parses as five
  nested dicts and every insert fails with "Key path not found" — which strips
  exactly the entitlements injection depends on.
- **One block per Grid UPDATE** — a chain message carrying several models only
  places the first. But that one block may carry ALL its params with all 8
  scene values + `scene_mode` flags at once (strings too). Lane sub-blocks
  (input/output control, splitter, mixer) take ONE value per message; their
  scene params need assign (`scene_mode:true`) + write per active scene.
- **Bypass-map row/column are array positions in a read**, like everything else.
  (For the bypass param index itself, see the per-scene bypass note above.)
- **`default_scene` = the scene active at save time.** Set the scene, then
  File CREATE. A Grid UPDATE with `default_scene` is a no-op.
- **File ops** (copy/delete/rename/setlist create, author rules): see
  `docs/DIRECTORY.md` "File operations". Always send `type` explicitly.
- **Never "rebuild" a preset from `describe()`** — it is a summary. A rebuild
  verified only against it silently dropped the preset's MIDI out. Diff the
  raw `BinaryPreset` (every field) before trusting a clone.
- **Captures**: block hash 14000(V1)/14001(V2) + param[5] `file_name`=`<64hex key><name>`;
  also list the key in the preset's `factory_/product_dependencies`.
- **Loading Downloads/Plugin presets** uses `key_in_downloads` (cloud_id) / plugin key, not
  folder+position. And **recalls REQUIRE `folder_key`** — a folderless SetlistPosition
  UPDATE is silently refused (device echoes the unchanged position back). `recall_preset`
  now defaults to the current folder and verifies the position actually moved.
- **Value taper**: ModelRepo declares a JUCE `skew` on 773 params and `catalog.py`
  honours it — `norm = ((display-lo)/(hi-lo))**skew`. Sanity anchor: Gain (16005) LEVEL
  is −60..+12 dB, skew 3.8018, and 0 dB lands on norm **0.5** exactly. `LIN_SKEW`/
  `LOG_SKEW` and skew-less params fall back to the heuristic: `min>0 and max/min>=5`
  ⇒ power taper (k≈1.667), else linear. Ranges that are symbolic names in the XML
  need a calibrated entry in `catalog.SYMBOLIC` or they fall through unconverted.
- **Lane output level** = `LaneOutputControl`(23000) param 0 VOLUME, **-40..+12 dB**
  linear (0 dB = 0.769230783). It lives in `Chain.output_control`, so it is stored
  in the preset — the right knob for balancing presets against each other. PAN is
  idx 1, shown as 50L..C..50R = `(nv-0.5)*100`.
- **`IOMeter`(5) streams at ~4 Hz** after a bare `IOMeter` CREATE, `request_id=0`
  (take the latest). Values are **linear amplitude 0..1, not dB**. One bridge-mode
  session produced no frames at all — treat "no reading" as a resting state.
- **One bridge reader at a time.** The out FIFO is a single stream: if the MCP
  server holds a bridge connection and a script opens another, they steal each
  other's frames and reads silently return `None` (telemetry still flows, so it
  looks like a dead session). `disconnect` the MCP before driving the device from
  a script.
- **Every user-facing string goes through `t()`.** `app/src/shared/i18n/` holds
  `en.ts` and `zh-CN.ts`, typed `Record<Key, string>` so a MISSING translation
  is a compile error — but nothing catches a string that never went through
  `t()` at all, which is how ~120 hard-coded English strings once landed in a
  translated app. `app/tests/localized.test.ts` sweeps the renderer for bare
  English JSX and checks both dictionaries for matching keys, `{vars}` and
  balanced `**`/`` ` ``. `shared/session.ts` and `shared/run-plan.ts` translate
  too, so the MAIN process narrates a plan in the user's language.
- **Keyboard shortcuts are declared once**, in `app/src/renderer/src/keys.ts`;
  the legend and the `?` sheet are generated from that list, and `shortcut(key)`
  is the only way to look one up — `SHORTCUTS.find(...)!` returned undefined
  after a rename and took every keydown in the window down with it.
- **A save makes the device broadcast a `RecallPreset` payload**, and it sits in
  the transport's buffer until something reads it. `Bench.open()` listens for
  that broadcast as proof the recall landed, so it must DRAIN the buffer before
  asking and confirm the setlist pointer before believing a payload — without
  that, after a Save-all every `open()` returned the PREVIOUS recall's preset
  for the rest of the session (measured 2026-09-09: open(B) gave A's lanes,
  open(A) gave B's). `tests/test_leveling.py` fakes the stale frame.
- **The Leveling screen must not jump.** Every band whose content varies keeps
  its size: alternatives in one cell are all mounted and toggled by visibility,
  numeric cells have fixed widths, prose gets one ellipsised footline per band,
  the dock reserves its run-chip cell, the drawer has a fixed min-height. Only
  the bench rows scroll. `app/harness/nojump.html` walks the view through its
  states with a ResizeObserver on every band and logs any jump; run it headless
  with `npx electron harness/shot.mjs http://localhost:4173/nojump.html out.png
  19000` after `npx vite build -c harness/vite.config.ts` + `vite preview`
  (`.claude/launch.json` has the server). `shot.mjs` renders any harness page to
  a PNG the same way — the Browser pane cannot screenshot while hidden. Exactly
  ONE control is `variant="primary"` at a time (`bench.nextStep`), and every
  `backdrop-filter: blur()` needs a `body.win` override (`tests/styles.test.ts`).
- **A bench run is ONE call that loops server-side.** Stopping it needs the
  `cancel` op (`leveling.py` sets a flag `measure_many` reads between presets);
  a client-side flag stops only what the renderer loops over itself — Apply and
  the audition walk.
- **The session lock is the single source of truth for who holds the device.**
  `~/Library/Application Support/qc-mcp/session.json` (next to the socket;
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\qc-mcp\` on Windows) — `{pid, owner, mode, socket, firmware,
  launched_by, app_pid}`. The daemon writes it after the device is open (never
  before, so it cannot claim a session that failed to start) and releases it on
  exit; a bare `qc-mcp` MCP server writes one too, because a stdio server that
  opened the device itself was the contender nothing could see. **`pid` is the
  liveness test** — a stale record reads as no owner, so a SIGKILLed daemon
  leaves no lasting lie. Starting a daemon over a live owner raises
  `lockfile.Held` with a sentence naming who, which pid and what mode; pass
  `--takeover` only after actually stopping them. `--launched-by patchbay` is
  what lets a reader tell our session from somebody else's: Patchbay stops what
  it started and *evicts* (a named step, never a side effect) what it did not.
  Do NOT go back to inferring this from `pgrep`, FIFO existence or a socket
  probe — those three could each be true about a different world, which is what
  the lock exists to end. **The socket and the lock are separate facts**: a
  socket file outlives the process that made it, and a process can outlive its
  socket (Patchbay's old `stop()` deleted an adopted daemon's socket without
  killing it — device held, nobody served, nothing to see). `heldBy.serving`
  is an actual connect, never `existsSync`.
- **`os.kill(pid, 0)` is a KILL on Windows, not a probe.** Anything but
  CTRL_C_EVENT/CTRL_BREAK_EVENT goes to `TerminateProcess` with the signal as
  the exit code, so the POSIX "does this process exist" idiom would execute the
  owner of the device on every read of the lock. `lockfile._alive_win32` uses
  `OpenProcess` + `WaitForSingleObject` (not `GetExitCodeProcess`, whose
  STILL_ACTIVE is 259 — also a legal exit code, so a process that exited with
  259 would read as alive for ever). `tests/test_platform.py` guards both.
  Node's `process.kill(pid, 0)` IS safe on Windows: libuv special-cases 0.
- **CorOS version matters.** `connect`/`device_info` report `firmware` +
  `protocol_generation`; 4.1-only tools gate on `P.require(...)`. The device's
  human version is in `Version.zenos_git_hash` — `app_fw_version` is a build hash.
- **Device presets (4.1)**: `list_device_presets` / `load_device_preset` /
  `save_device_preset` / `delete_device_preset`. Loading is a **Grid UPDATE with
  `update_type=MODEL_PRESET`**, not a ModelPreset write. Saving needs the device
  to know which block you mean: `select_model_slot(row, col)` first (a
  `ModelPreset` with **no action field** + `loaded_row`/`loaded_column`) — without
  it every write is silently ignored. The device also **refuses a save whose
  params match an existing preset** ("Preset Conflict"); tweak something first.
- **Settings presets (4.1)**: Global EQ and I/O Settings are device presets on
  pseudo-models (`4004` Output Equalizer / `31000` IOSettings) applied through
  their OWN message (`GlobalEQ.model_preset_to_load` / `IOSettings.preset_to_load`).
  Both overwrite **global** state; a Global EQ load is reversible (read all 28
  params first, write them back), an I/O load is not — `load_settings_preset`
  snapshots and demands `confirm=True`.
- **I/O port levels are a preamp trim, not a fader: IN 1 is -12 .. +60 dB**,
  linear, and `catalog.io_level_to_db()/io_level_from_db()` are the conversion.
  SYMBOLIC cannot carry it — ModelRepo declares IOSettings(31000) levels as a
  literal `min=0 max=1`, so the generic range code believes the display range IS
  0..1 and converts nothing. Measured 2026-09-09 on CorOS 4.1.0 against the
  app's I/O panel (min -12.00, max +60.00, and the untouched 0.166667 = 0.00 dB,
  an interior point exactly on the line). Only IN 1 is measured; every other
  port returns None rather than a plausible number from the wrong range. Two
  traps found while measuring: a read taken straight after an I/O write returns
  the device's ECHO of that write, not its state (drain one read before
  verifying), and **Cortex Control reads I/O settings only when its panel
  opens** — it will not redraw for a write from anybody else.
- **Writing I/O settings**: send ONLY the fields you're changing. A full port
  record (every field, e.g. a protobuf `CopyFrom`) is silently rejected — that's
  why I/O writes look impossible. `input_type` is **0=Instrument, 1.0=Mic**
  — measured 2026-09-09 against the app on both combo inputs (in 1 stored 0.0 /
  Instrument, in 2 stored 1.0 / Mic with a condenser on 48V). It was documented
  as 3-position with 1.0=Line, which made `get_io_settings` report a mic input
  as a line input; 0.5 has never been observed. **Full QC only** — the Mini has
  no input-type switch, so on an ATMA the field is not a control and the names
  should not be trusted.
- **Stomp assignments live on `Grid`**, not their own message: Grid UPDATE with
  `preset.stomp_mode_assignments[]{row, column, stomp_index, type}` (A-H = 0-7;
  `type` PRIMARY/SECONDARY = the 4.1 dual-footswitch). DELETE unassigns.
  **Latching/momentary must be its own Grid UPDATE** (`stomp_is_momentary` map) —
  sent alongside an assignment it's overwritten by the device's echo.
  A block holds one assignment **per kind** (verified: Vintage Digital on E
  PRIMARY + F SECONDARY at once). The device does NOT guard SECONDARY — it
  accepts it on blocks with no second function, silently wasting a switch.
  MCP: `assign_stomp` / `unassign_stomp`.

## Platform split (macOS vs Windows)
- **Direct mode and running-alongside-the-app work on both**, by different means:
  macOS injects a dylib and shares the app's session; **Windows just opens a
  second NON-exclusive handle** (`QuadCortex(share=True)`) because the HID stack
  copies every input report to every open handle, and Cortex Control opens with
  `FILE_SHARE_READ|WRITE`. Only `tools/gui/` is still macOS-only. Don't add a
  `sys.platform` test in the tools — ask `backend.bridge_supported()` /
  `direct_supported()` so there's one place to change.
- **On Windows `auto` ALWAYS takes a non-exclusive handle**, even with Cortex
  Control shut — an exclusively-held HID handle can never be shared later, so
  seizing first locks the app out for the whole session (that is exactly how
  "Cortex Control does not see the QC while the MCP is connected" happens). The
  old gate — share only if the app is ALREADY running — was a macOS-shaped
  precondition: there the app owns a session we can only ride, so it must exist
  first. `direct` stays the explicit way to seize.
- **A shared handle RIDES the app's session; it must not handshake.** Our
  `ResetCommsBuffers{session_id}`+`Version`+`Connection` from a second handle
  makes the device drop the app's subscriptions (its `CPULoad` stream stops)
  and Cortex Control shows "Device connection lost" seconds after we join
  (QC Mini, CorOS 4.1.0). `open()` sniffs the wire for 1.5 s first: the device
  streams only under a heartbeat, so traffic = someone owns a session = ride
  it (`qc.riding`, no handshake/heartbeat of ours, like the macOS bridge);
  silence = make our own. Riding dies with the app: `disconnect`→`connect`.
  Never run `tools/win_hid_check.py` with the app up: it opens exclusively.
- **Shared mode has two independent writers on one endpoint.** Single-report
  messages are atomic (~97% of the app's traffic), multi-report ones can
  interleave — `connect()` returns a `caution` saying so. Build/save presets in
  direct mode with the app quit.
- **Windows `WriteFile` returns ERROR_GEN_FAILURE(31) constantly on writes that
  DO land** (60 of them in a session that provably wrote) — it is the Windows
  `0xe0005000`, listed in `WinHIDTransport.BENIGN_WRITE_CODES`. Never judge a
  write by it; read the value back. And test writes with a *continuous* param —
  amp param 0 `INPUT` is a discrete selector that clamps and mimics a lost write.
- **`interceptor-win/` is capture-only**: the IAT hooks mirror both directions
  fine; injection is unverified (the earlier ERROR_GEN_FAILURE diagnosis was
  wrong, so it is simply open). `winbridge.py` is its tested-but-unused client.
- Windows quirks that look like protocol bugs: input reports are **padded** to 129
  bytes (the frame's own `chunkLen` is the truth); writes must be **exactly**
  `OutputReportByteLength` including the report id; the handle is overlapped so
  every read/write needs an `OVERLAPPED`.
- **`winhid.py` imports on any OS** (plain ctypes types, DLLs bound lazily in
  `_load()`) so `tests/test_platform.py` can check it from a Mac. Keep it that way.
- **A HID device held exclusively vanishes from enumeration** — Windows refuses
  even a zero-access probe open, so `enumerate_devices` recovers the ids from the
  interface path and marks it `busy`; without that, "quit Cortex Control" gets
  misreported as "no device found". Verified on hardware.
- **Windows-facing runtime strings are ASCII** (no em-dashes): a legacy console
  codepage renders them as `?`. Docstrings/comments are exempt.
- Verified on Win10 22H2 x64 + CorOS 4.1.0: reads, the 8336-capture directory
  stream, open/close cycles, and the device-busy error. **Writes not yet run from
  Windows** (same `set_report` path, so no untested Windows code — but untried).
- **Audio / measured leveling** (`loudness.py`, `audio_io.py`, `autolevel.py`; extra
  `.[audio]`). Distinct from the Bench (`leveling.py`), which is the manual by-ear
  service the Patchbay Leveling view attaches to. Measure on **host USB in 5/6**, never
  3/4 — 3/4 is fed from the *analog outputs* so it folds master volume into the reading.
  **Never play on host outputs 1–4**: they bypass The Grid straight to the analog jacks
  (full level into the monitors); the code raises. Reamp = lane `in_portid=12` +
  `out_portid=14`, both restored in a `finally`. A **silent capture means denied
  microphone permission**, not a quiet preset — macOS returns silence rather than
  failing. See docs/LEVELING.md + docs/METERS.md.

## Conventions
- This is for interop/debugging on hardware you own + licensed software. Keep capture logs
  and the device's `catalog.json` out of git (they hold session ids / personal library
  names). Don't distribute re-signed app copies.
- On commits: end messages with the Co-Authored-By trailer; branch before committing to
  `main`; commit/push only when asked.
