# AGENTS.md — working on this project

An index, not a summary. Almost everything worth knowing is already in the
repository — the point of this file is to tell you where, and to stop you
redoing a handful of things that have already been tried and measured.

## What it is

A six-agent CrewAI pipeline that assesses whether a piece of academic research
is commercially viable. Three evidence agents (academic / patent / market) run
in parallel, then a report writer, a reviewer, and a scorer. Served two ways
from one codebase: a FastAPI + vanilla-JS web client and a CLI.

Live at https://academic-commercialization-agent.up.railway.app

Current state: 1106 tests (529 subtests), CI green on Linux + Windows × Python
3.11/3.12, deployed on Railway.

## Commands

```bash
uv run pytest -q                       # the whole suite; ~7s, zero network
uv run --with ruff ruff check .        # CI uses latest ruff, the local pin is older
uv run uvicorn api.main:app --reload   # web client on :8000
uv run python -m academic_agent.main "<topic>"   # one run from the CLI
```

`uv run --with ruff` is deliberate. The pinned local ruff is 0.12.0 and CI
resolves `latest`; they disagree, and the flag is what makes a local check mean
what CI will say.

## Hard conventions

- **`filterwarnings = ["error::UserWarning"]`.** What it mainly guards: code
  paths that would reach a paid API warn and fall back rather than raising, so
  a test that leaks would otherwise pass silently. When a test trips it, read
  *which* warning fired before concluding anything. If it is the network one,
  the test is calling something real — fix the test's isolation, never add an
  ignore. But the project also warns deliberately on an unrecognised weight
  profile and on an audit screen that failed, and two test files assert those
  on purpose (`assertWarns`), so not every UserWarning is a leak.
- **No bare `except Exception`** without a `# noqa: BLE001` and a reason. ruff
  enforces it; the exceptions in this repo each say why in a comment.
- **CI also runs pylint, narrowly,** for `E0701` alone (except-clause ordering).
  ruff has no equivalent, and a real bug here was `except HTTPError` placed
  after `except URLError` — dead code, so every auth failure was retried as
  transient.
- **Commit messages carry the reasoning.** They are long on purpose and are a
  primary record — see below. **Do not add `Co-Authored-By` lines.**
- **Reply to the user in Chinese.** The code, comments, and commit messages
  stay in English.

## Where the reasoning lives

This project deliberately keeps its "why" out of chat logs and inside artifacts
that travel with the repo. When you want to know why something is the way it
is, in this order:

| Question | Where |
|---|---|
| Why is this code like this? | The comment above it. Non-obvious decisions are commented, including rejected alternatives |
| Why does this test exist? | Its docstring names the specific failure it caught |
| Why was this change made? | `git log` — bodies run to ~25 lines and explain the alternative that was rejected |
| Was this hypothesis tested? | `docs/prereg-*.md` — predictions and falsification criteria registered *before* paid runs |
| Full decision history, first person | `notes/简历项目说明.md` — **a separate private repo** (`shuxiachai/academic-agent-notes`), gitignored here. 3,526 lines, 45 write-ups. Ask the user for access if you need it |

Before writing or modifying CrewAI code specifically — the crew, the agents,
the task definitions — read `docs/crewai-reference.md`. That is the vendor's
auto-generated reference, and the library moves faster than most training
data. It used to occupy this filename, which meant an assistant opening the
repo got 1,000 lines about the framework and nothing about the project.

## Do not redo these

Each of these was implemented or measured and then rejected **on data**. The
numbers are the point; if you want to revisit one, beat the number.

- **Do not change the scoring formula or the `evidence_confidence` floor.**
  Every calibration figure this project reports comes from 30 runs scored under
  the current rules (26/30 TRL calibration, 30/30 formula correct, 30/30
  completed). Changing the computation retires that baseline, which is the only
  external anchor the project has. The floor is knowingly asymmetric — it only
  ever raises confidence — and `evidence.py` says so explicitly.
- **Do not add a "maturity language vs TRL" consistency check.** Built,
  measured on all 30 baseline reports, produced 2 flags and both were wrong: a
  paragraph attributes properties to several subjects and phrase matching
  cannot tell which one carries it. Requiring the topic's words nearby does not
  help — the incumbent in a carbon-capture report is also called "capture". The
  reasoning is preserved in `consistency.py` so nobody tries it a third time.
- **Do not make the uncited-claim screen blocking.** Measured on 30 delivered
  reports: 134 warnings across 30/30 reports, so blocking would have failed
  every run. After four exclusions it is 62 across 20/30 — still two thirds.
  The precision work is worth continuing; the blocking is not viable yet.
- **Do not add prompt caching.** Measured: 3.4% cache hit. A run is 6 requests
  and the six agents have different prefixes, so there is nothing reusable
  within a run.
- **Do not "improve" claim-grounding coverage by scraping more abstracts.**
  Checked: academic sources are already 68/68 with real abstracts. The only
  remaining headroom is the patent domain, and it needs a free Lens key, not
  code.
- **Do not upgrade CrewAI on main.** Pinned at `1.14.7`. If it needs upgrading,
  do it on a branch with a full benchmark comparison.

Two TRL rubric hypotheses were pre-registered and **both falsified** (see
`docs/`). If you want to improve calibration, the next step is a different
method — independent scores from several models, compared — not another rubric
edit.

## How work is done here

These are not style preferences; each came from a specific failure.

- **Measure before you change.** Twice now an external review's premise was
  correct and its proposed implementation was wrong, and the only thing that
  distinguished them was running the check over the 30 reports already on disk
  first. That data is free.
- **Re-inject the defect after fixing it.** Confirm the new test actually goes
  red. Twice this caught a weak *test* rather than a weak implementation.
- **Test the seam, not the field.** The worst class of bug here has been a
  value computed correctly and stored correctly that never reached the client:
  `response_model` silently drops undeclared fields, and two features never
  worked in a browser while 948 tests passed. Assert at the boundary, and
  assert the rule ("every key on the payload reaches both endpoints"), not the
  instance.
- **Precision over recall for every heuristic screen.** These report; they do
  not reject. A false positive on a finished six-agent run discards a paid
  assessment over a wording choice.
- **Silence is not a pass.** "0 unsupported out of 0 checked" and "everything
  passed" produce the same two numbers. Anywhere a check can fail to run, say
  so distinctly — the reliability panel and `claim_grounding.py` both do.
- **Prose is not covered by tests.** One recent round found five places where a
  comment, a docstring, or UI copy described behaviour the code did not have.
  When you change behaviour, the sentence next to it is part of the change.

## Layout

```
src/academic_agent/     pipeline: crew, agents/tasks config, source retrieval,
                        evidence models + guardrails, scoring, worker
  source_pipeline.py    ~2,900 lines, retrieval for all three domains
  evidence.py           models, guardrails, scoring rubric
  pipeline_worker.py    the subprocess one run executes in
api/                    FastAPI: runs registry, papers, access gate, models
web/                    vanilla JS client, no build step, strict CSP
ui/                     shared i18n, run-reader, and PDF-export utilities
tests/                  49 Python files, organised by subject under test
benchmark.py            paid batch runs; --fixtures replays frozen evidence
ops_report.py           what real runs actually did, vs what the benchmark covers
```

Runs are subprocesses writing to `outputs/<run_id>/`; the API, the browser and
the CLI all observe the same run through those files rather than shared memory.
A run URL is a capability — the id is the credential.

## Things that are known-open

- Blocking on uncited claims (above) — needs the detector tighter first.
- The benchmark's input distribution misses the shapes real traffic has:
  Chinese topics, very short inputs, non-technical topics. Before adding them,
  decide whether each is a "should succeed" or a "should fail gracefully" case;
  the assertions differ completely.
- Code-package analysis (the other half of "upload a paper or a code package")
  is unbuilt.
- **No evidence exists that the output is *useful*.** Everything the project
  can currently demonstrate is that it does not lie — citations check out,
  formulas are right, hallucination rate is 0. Whether a TTO officer would act
  on a report is unmeasured, and it is the gap that matters most.
