# KROMA

Self-hosted, direct-play media stack: a Rust server (axum + SQLite + out-of-process
module sidecars) and a Bun workspace monorepo of web, TV, mobile and desktop clients
sharing one universal component library.

See [`README.md`](README.md) for the product overview, [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md)
for the structural north-star, and [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) for setup.

## Read before writing code

- [`CODE_STYLE.md`](CODE_STYLE.md) for how code is written here. **The default is no
  comment.** Document exported API only; never private functions or fields. The one
  exception is a kit component's props, which are its public API.
  Never narrate your work in a source file.
- [`CONVENTIONS.md`](CONVENTIONS.md) for cross-file house rules (zod at trust
  boundaries, where secrets live, the values that are never written raw).
- [`packages/ui/src/components/README.md`](packages/ui/src/components/README.md) for
  the component hierarchy: the six levels, what earns a place at each, and the
  three doors out of the kit.
- [`packages/ui/src/components/DESIGN.md`](packages/ui/src/components/DESIGN.md) for
  **how a component's API is shaped**: the part vocabulary, when a `data` prop
  beats children, the controlled/uncontrolled signature, prop naming, and what
  `asChild` means here (`<Slot>`, with a written-down merge). Read it before
  adding a component or changing one's props.
- [`modules/README.md`](modules/README.md) for authoring a module.
- [`docs/tv-pairing.md`](docs/tv-pairing.md) for the three roads a television
  takes to an account, what "the same network" means, and which shells can hear
  a television on the link rather than being told about it.

## Checks

These are the CI hard gates (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`, see
[`docs/ci.md`](docs/ci.md)):

```bash
bun run typecheck        # every TS workspace (= `bun run ci typecheck`, a bounded pool)
bun run test             # vitest (two projects: web + native)
bun run check            # biome format + lint  (check:fix to write)
bun run ci rust clippy   # server workspace + every module workspace
bun run ci rust test     # the same, under coverage (cargo llvm-cov)
```

`bun run ci <command>` is `packages/ci-tools`, the CLI every workflow step
runs; `bun run ci lanes --json` tells you which jobs a branch will trigger.
The Rust commands walk the module workspaces too: modules are separate cargo
workspaces, so `--workspace` from `server/` does not reach them (see below).
`cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets` and `cargo test --workspace` in
`server/` are still the quick local loop for the server alone.

`bun run modules:check` (`kroma check` over every module: manifests valid,
frontends typed, clippy clean) and `bun run deadcode` (knip) are **not** wired
into any workflow today. Run them by hand after touching a module.

Rust is pinned by `rust-toolchain.toml` (1.96.1, with clippy + rustfmt); the
workspace `rust-version` floor is 1.88. `cargo fmt --check` is non-blocking: the
codebase uses a custom import grouping, so do not reformat files wholesale.

## Running things

```bash
bun install
bun run dev              # server:watch (:4040) + web (:3000) + tizen shell (:5174)
bun run dev:webonly      # server + web only
bun run dev:web          # web alone (Vite proxies /api -> :4040)
bun run dev:tizen        # :5174   Samsung   (arrow keys + Enter act as the remote)
bun run dev:webos        # :5175   LG
bun run dev:kit          # design-system workbench
bun run server           # cargo run  (no feature flags: the ML backends are the
                         # whisper and vector sidecars' own build choice)
```

With no media configured the server seeds demo titles. Point it at real files with
`KROMA_MEDIA_DIRS=/path/to/media`. Full env-var table in
[`server/README.md`](server/README.md); `RUST_LOG=debug` for logs.

Every root script is `<verb>:<target>` (`dev:` / `build:` / `deploy:` / `kit:`);
`bun run` with no argument lists them all. Anything targeting one workspace is
`bun run --filter '@kromatv/<name>' <script>`.

### Running a single test

`bun run test` is `vitest run` over the whole repo. To narrow:

```bash
bun run test packages/core/src/hevc.test.ts        # one file
bun run test --project web -t 'rejects a range'    # one test name, one project
cd server && cargo test -p kroma-scene             # one Rust crate
cd server && cargo test --workspace parse_episode  # one Rust test filter
```

There are **two vitest projects** because the repo has two module-resolution
universes: `web` (`.web.*` files win, mirrors the shells' Vite config) and `native`
(Metro precedence, plain file wins). A test that must run under Metro resolution is
named `*.native.test.ts`; the include globs are derived from the web list so the two
cannot drift. Default environment is `node`; a test needing a DOM opts in with
`// @vitest-environment jsdom`.

## Architecture

### Server (Rust): layered, compiler-enforced

`server/` is a cargo workspace. The layers are crates, so the inward-only dependency
rule is enforced by the compiler, not by a CI grep.

```
server/
  src/            kroma-server BINARY: main.rs + api/ (router + handlers only)
  crates/
    kroma-domain      entities + pure rules: serde ONLY, no axum/rusqlite/reqwest
    kroma-primitives  timestamps · short hashes · random tokens
    kroma-config      env-parsed Config
    kroma-sqlite      the WAL pool, the storage grant, a module's migrations
    kroma-db          all SQL on top of it, one shared Pool
    kroma-engine      infra + services + state + model, the business logic
    kroma-http kroma-i18n kroma-push
    kroma-module-*    the module host: kernel, manifest, macros, sdk, runtime,
                      host, supervisor, wire. It carries the
                      MECHANISM and never the meaning: nothing here names a
                      module's domain (see docs/module-plugin-model.md)
modules/<id>/       NOT in this workspace, see below
modules/lib/        shared Rust libraries, not modules: naming (and scene, in its own dir)
```

A sidecar links a strict subset: `kroma-module-{sdk,runtime,host,manifest,
macros,wire}`, `kroma-sqlite`, `kroma-http`, `kroma-primitives`,
`kroma-testing`. It never links `kroma-db` or `kroma-domain`, which is why the
JSON both sides exchange lives in `kroma-module-wire` and the pool in
`kroma-sqlite`, each re-exported by the crate that used to own it.

`api/` translates HTTP↔services and holds no business logic; `main.rs` and the
engine's `state.rs` are the only composition points. Integration tests live beside
the handlers as `src/api/it_*.rs`.

### Modules are out-of-process sidecars

KROMA's core is playback + catalog; everything else (downloads, indexers,
acquisition, VPN, whisper, vector, mDNS, remote, scene) is a **module** with a
reverse-DNS id like `tv.kroma.torrents`.

No module is a dependency of the server binary, and no crate under `server/`
names a module's domain in a type, trait or function. A module reaches a peer by
asking the host which modules answer a POINT name and speaking JSON both sides
declare themselves; each side owns its structs, because the two ends ship on
separate tags.

A point is named by whoever defines it: a module writes `definesPoints` for what
it invents (`<its id>/<local name>`), `contributes` for what it answers, and
`consumes` for what it calls. The three the CORE calls are bare — `acquisition`,
`transcriber`, `embedder` — because the core has no manifest to define one in and
nothing else may. See [`docs/module-plugin-model.md`](docs/module-plugin-model.md)
for the model and what is still missing from it, and
[`modules/README.md`](modules/README.md#calling-another-module) for how to write
one end.

Nothing is compiled into the server: this is the zero-module base build. Every
first-party module ships as an installable `.kmod` (a zstd bundle of
`module.json` + a native `module` binary + icon + `fe/`, the frontend the web
client loads at runtime).
`kroma-module-supervisor` scans `<data>/modules/*`, spawns each enabled module as
its own process on a free localhost port, and reverse-proxies
`/api/module/<id>/*` to it; modules call back into the core over the token-authed
`/api/_host/*` API for settings/events/jobs/session. A database is a **declared
capability**, not something every sidecar gets: a module with no `storage` in its
`module.json` does not link SQLite at all, and one that has it gets its own file
plus whatever slice of the core database it declared, enforced per connection by
SQLite's authorizer. See [`docs/modules-as-kmod.md`](docs/modules-as-kmod.md) and
[`modules/README.md`](modules/README.md#storage).

Modules release **independently of the server**, each on its own tag
`<module-id>@<version>`, from `.github/workflows/modules.yml`. So **bump
`version` in `module.json` in the same commit as any change to a module** — CI
content-hashes each bundle against the published catalog and fails a run whose
bytes moved while its version stood still (the Store decides "update available"
by comparing versions, so a silent republish reaches nobody).

**Each module at `modules/<id>` is its own cargo workspace** (explicit package
metadata, its own `Cargo.lock`, its own `release-kmod` profile), so it builds and
tests standalone (`cd modules/<id>/server && cargo build`). Cargo members must be
hierarchically below their workspace root, which is exactly why modules cannot be
members of `server/`. The server reaches the only three it still links (scene via
the SDK, whisper and vector behind their features) as path deps across the
workspace boundary, which cargo *does* allow.

Consequences worth knowing: features are **bare** (`--features local`, never
`kroma-whisper/local`, inside its own single-package workspace that names a
dependency); one `cargo build` can no longer select every module, so
`bun run kroma plan` emits one per module against a shared
`CARGO_TARGET_DIR` (`target/kmod`); and any container that builds the server or a
module must mount the **whole repo**, not `server/`.

Every module chore is the `kroma` CLI (`packages/cli`; `bun run kroma
<command>` here). A module written outside this repository is the same
project: `bunx @kromatv/sdk create`, depending on the one public npm package `@kromatv/sdk`
(the SDK and the kit as declarations only, the Rust crates it links, and the
CLI), assembled at release time from the private workspace packages
(`docs/module-sdk-publishing.md`).

```bash
bun run kroma create tv.kroma.notes   # scaffold under modules/
bun run kroma check                   # manifests, frontend types, clippy
bun run kroma build                   # every .kmod into dist/modules
cd modules/tv.kroma.notes && bunx kroma dev   # install on a server, rebuild on save
bun run kroma release --dry-run --repo <owner/repo>   # CI's publish verdict
```

A module's frontend is a bundle the web client loads at runtime. It takes
`react`, `@kromatv/ui`, `@kromatv/module-sdk`, `@kromatv/core`, `@kromatv/client` and
the query cache from the host (`SHARED_MODULES` in `@kromatv/module-sdk`), so a
page renders inside the host's theme with one React on the page; nothing in
`clients/web` names a module.

Modules install from **registries**: one pinned official catalog plus any the
operator adds under Admin → Modules → Registries. Official always wins an id
clash, an added catalog must be https, and every artifact is sha256-verified
before it is unpacked. See [`docs/module-registries.md`](docs/module-registries.md).

### Frontend: one component library, thin shells

Three workspace roots, and the split is what each one is FOR:

```
packages/  libraries, consumed by name and never by path
  client/   one KromaClient namespace per domain (src/api/<domain>/), whose zod
            schemas ARE the wire types; the transport and events in src/core/
  core/     the rules on top of the client: HEVC detection, direct-play, i18n,
            remote map. It re-exports nothing
  ui/       @kromatv/ui: the design system, authored against React Native
  tv/       the whole 10-foot experience (spatial focus nav, home, detail, player)
  workbench the component atelier + the story SDK the kit's stories are written in
  bundler   the shared Vite/Metro pipeline (rnw, mdx, shell, props-docs, site)
  site-kit site-meta module-sdk cli push-relay ...
clients/   the product's shells, thin: web · tizen · webos · tv-web · tv-native ·
           mobile · desktop (Tauri+mpv) · synology · tv-build + expo-build (pipelines)
apps/      the web properties, deployed to Cloudflare
  www/      @kromatv/site: kroma.tv, prerendered marketing + blog
  kit/      @kromatv/kit: the workbench, as a site and as a phone/TV app
  modules/  @kromatv/modules-site: the official .kmod catalog
  packages/ @kromatv/package-source: the release listing DSM downloads from
```

A client ships the product; an app is a website about it. The two never import
each other, and both reach a library by its `@kromatv/*` name.

- `@kromatv/ui` is authored **against React Native** and renders natively on Apple TV /
  Android TV / iOS / Android, and through **react-native-web** on Tizen, webOS, the
  Tauri desktop shell and the web client. Components are consumed as source: no
  build step; `react`/`react-native` are peer deps. One component per file,
  kebab-case, named after its export; every component is a folder holding its code,
  story, demos and tests. Six levels, each knowing only the ones below it:
  `src/core/tokens/` → `src/components/{atoms,molecules,organisms,templates}/`.
  **Pages are not in the kit**: they live in `packages/tv/src/features/*` and
  `clients/*/src`. See `packages/ui/src/components/README.md`.
- **Components are composed, not configured.** A component that is a set of
  parts exposes them by name in Radix's shape (`<ChoiceList.Root>` /
  `.Item` / `.Label`), with the Root owning state, semantics and behaviour.
  **A face a part exists for is never also a prop**: there is one spelling and it
  is the part. `icon` stays a prop, and so does a name nothing draws.
  Two rules Radix does not have to carry: the **whole row is the control** (one
  D-pad stop, a pointer-sized hit area), so indicators are non-pressable faces;
  and a control's shape comes from the one shell table in `lib/field-shell`,
  never from its own paddings.
- **Clients stay thin.** UI belongs in `@kromatv/ui`, logic in `@kromatv/core`, the TV
  experience in `@kromatv/tv`. Write platform code once.
- Both `clients/web/src` and `packages/tv/src` are **feature-sliced**
  (`features/{catalog,playback,accounts,admin,…}` + `shared/` + `app`/`routes`).
  Dependency rule: `features/* → shared/* → @kromatv/ui → @kromatv/core →
  @kromatv/client`. A feature **must not import a sibling feature**: lift shared
  code to `shared/`.
- **Three doors, and each thing is behind exactly one.** Nothing re-exports
  another, so the import path says where a symbol comes from:
  - `@kromatv/client/<domain>` — what one domain owns: its zod schemas, its ids,
    its response types. `ItemId` is media's, `CastReceiver` is cast's.
  - `@kromatv/client` — what no single domain owns: `KromaClient`, the transport,
    the session store, and the ids two domains share (`DeviceId` names a
    television on the cast roster AND on a handoff beacon).
  - `@kromatv/core` — what is not a wire type at all: the rules built on top,
    and shapes derived from one (`DiscoveredTv` extends the handoff domain's
    `HandoffDevice` with fields the server never sends).

  Wire types are never hand-redefined; adding or changing a payload means
  editing the zod schema in `packages/client/src/api/<domain>/`. Nothing lists
  the domains: the package's `exports` maps `./*` onto `src/api/*/index.ts`, so
  **adding a domain is adding a folder**.
- Subpath imports: `#ui/*`, `#tv/*`, `#web/*` (see `tsconfig.base.json`).
- Design tokens live in TypeScript only. `kromaUI()` (`@kromatv/ui/vite`) expands
  `@import "@kromatv/ui/css"` into them at build time, so there is no generated CSS
  to commit and nothing to keep in step.
- Static style declarations (`styles()`, `sv()`) compile ahead of time on the
  browser targets: `kromaUI()`'s `kroma-atomic` plugin emits atomic classes into
  the token sheet and rewrites the call site (StyleX's shape, react-native-web's
  compiler). React Native resolves at runtime as before. See
  `packages/ui/src/core/atomic/README.md`, including what the engine's pure
  core owes the plugin (Node loads it natively).
- `react-native` is aliased repo-wide to `react-native-tvos` via root `overrides`
  **and** a root dependency: both entries are load-bearing (the long comment in
  `package.json` explains why); do not "clean them up".

### TV shells

Each shell is driven by its `tv.target.ts` (platform, dev port, engine floors)
through the shared pipeline in [`packages/bundler/src/shell.ts`](packages/bundler/src/shell.ts).
webOS additionally ships a **legacy tier** (ES2015 + flattened CSS,
runtime-gated) for Chromium 53–94 TVs; `build:webos` runs a compat guard that fails
the build on anything a legacy engine cannot parse.

## Conventions worth knowing up front

- **File size:** hard-split files > 300 LOC; split 200–300 only at a natural seam.
  Cut at a domain/layer seam, never at an arbitrary line. Generated, vendored,
  locale-JSON and irreducible-adapter files are exempt.
- **zod at every trust boundary**: HTTP bodies, stored blobs, third-party JSON,
  cross-process messages. No `typeof` chains, no `as Record<string, unknown>`.
  Bound the body size by hand *before* parsing.
- **Secrets never live in the server or the app**: the server's source is public and
  self-hosted, so anything Apple or Google issued to the published app lives in the
  relay Worker's secrets (`packages/push-relay/`).
- **English for code, comments, identifiers and commit messages.** User-facing copy
  is French. That is content, not code. No emoji in the product.
- Every user-visible string is a translation key. The core catalogs are one
  folder per language and one file per namespace,
  `packages/core/src/locales/{en,fr}/<namespace>.json`: nothing lists them, the
  Vite plugin finds, types and bundles them with the code that names their keys
  (see [`docs/i18n.md`](docs/i18n.md)); modules ship their own
  `locales/{en,fr}.json` resolved against the module's catalog first.
