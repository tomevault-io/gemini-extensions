# AGENTS.md

Guidance for coding agents (Claude Code, Codex CLI) working in this repository. `CLAUDE.md` is a symlink to this file, so both assistants read the same instructions.

## What This Project Is

Crabigator is a Rust TUI wrapper around the Claude Code, Codex, opencode, and Grok CLIs. It spawns the assistant CLI in a PTY (pseudo-terminal) and adds status widgets below the interface showing git status, file changes, session statistics, per-turn recaps, and tracked PRs. Sessions can stream to the official dashboard or a compatible self-hosted Cloudflare Worker in `workers/crabigator-api/`.

Platform selection:

```bash
crabigator                  # Uses default platform (config/env/claude)
crabigator codex            # Use Codex CLI
crabigator claude           # Use Claude Code
crabigator opencode         # Use opencode
crabigator grok             # Use Grok Build (aliases: grok-build, xai)
crabigator --platform grok  # Explicit flag
```

Other subcommands: `inspect` (view running instances), `prs` (live cross-session PR board; `--once` prints one frame — only sessions with a live mirror under /tmp appear, the durable history lives on the web dashboard's PR board; `/` search also greps each live session's transcript and shows the matched excerpt inline, Tab toggles surrounding context; `↑↓` select a session and Enter toggles a quick look pane that mirrors its live screen in the bottom half — while open, `↑↓` scroll that session's transcript and `←→` switch sessions; the default PR view shows one block per primary PR — its GitHub status inline and every touching session as a sub-row beneath it, sorted by the freshest of session activity and PR events, GitHub's updatedAt included; `p` flips to session view, the transpose: one block per session — so blocks map one-to-one to your sessions — with every PR the session touches as a sub-row beneath it; `w` watches any PR by URL or owner/repo#number — watched PRs live in the cloud like dispositions, show on every board (the open board runs `gh` for them and relays the stats), and can also be added by typing "track PR <url>" in a session; dispositions (promote/demote/dismiss) are scoped: the ✕ on a session's own strip or on a session-view sub-row applies only to that session — or to its worktree directory when the session runs in a linked worktree, so future sessions there inherit it — while the ✕ on a PR-view block or a watched PR still removes the PR group-wide; `r` shows or hides recaps, `a` cycles activity ages, and `s` toggles live/all sessions), `pair` (dashboard auth code), `recap` (enable/disable/status for turn recaps), `key` (save an Anthropic API key for recaps), `install-launcher` (macOS crabigator:// URL handler), `resume`/`continue`.

Preferences live in `~/.crabigator/config.toml` (default platform, `ide` for clickable file links, terminal emulator override, recap settings, and `[pr_board]` view preferences saved by the PR board).

## Ask Questions Liberally

**Use the AskUserQuestion tool frequently throughout development - not just during planning.**

Asking questions is encouraged and appreciated because it:
- Helps both of us think through problems more clearly
- Surfaces edge cases and requirements that might be missed
- Leads to better solutions through collaborative dialogue
- Catches misunderstandings early before code is written

Ask about:
- Clarifying requirements and desired behavior
- UI/UX preferences and design decisions
- Trade-offs between different approaches
- Edge cases and error handling
- Whether a proposed solution matches expectations
- Anything you're uncertain about

Don't assume - ask. Multiple rounds of questions are better than one large batch. Even mid-implementation, if something feels unclear or you're choosing between options, ask. The interactive back-and-forth is valuable.

## Plain Language: ISO 24495-1

All prose you write for humans must follow the ISO 24495-1 plain language principles. This applies to everything, with no exceptions: summaries of your work, PR descriptions, **git commit messages**, and **everything in a release** — release notes, highlights, and the GitHub release description:

1. **Relevant**: Include what the reader needs and nothing else. A commit message explains what changed and why it matters; it does not narrate the debugging journey or list every file touched.
2. **Findable**: Put the most important information first. The commit subject line carries the change; the body adds the "why". Summaries lead with the outcome, then supporting detail.
3. **Understandable**: Use familiar words, active voice, and short sentences. One idea per sentence. Prefer "Show the session ID in the status bar" over "Implement session identifier visibility enhancements".
4. **Usable**: Write so the reader can act on it. A summary should let the user verify the work; a commit message should let a future reader decide whether this commit is the one they're hunting for.

For commit messages specifically:
- Subject line: imperative mood, plain words, describes the user-visible or behavioral change (matches existing history, e.g. "Keep previous recap visible between turns").
- Body (when needed): explain why the change was made and any non-obvious consequences, in complete sentences.
- No jargon, abbreviations, or codenames the reader can't be expected to know.

## Build Commands

```bash
cargo build           # Build the project
cargo build --release # Release build
cargo check           # Quick type checking
cargo test            # Run tests
cargo clippy          # Lint (also: make lint)
```

## Running

```bash
make run             # Run with provider from .crabigator-provider (default: claude)
make claude          # Set provider to Claude Code and run
make codex           # Set provider to Codex CLI and run
make claude-yolo     # Claude with --dangerously-skip-permissions
make codex-yolo      # Codex with --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox
make resume          # Resume last session
make continue        # Continue last conversation
make prs             # Build and run the cross-session PR board (alias: make pr)
```

## Testing

Fixture-based snapshots live under `tests/fixtures/` and are driven by `src/fixtures_tests.rs`.

```bash
make test            # Run all tests
make test-update     # Update fixture snapshots (CRABIGATOR_UPDATE_FIXTURES=1)
```

Fixture layout:
- `tests/fixtures/<name>/base` - baseline repo state
- `tests/fixtures/<name>/worktree` - working tree changes
- `tests/fixtures/<name>/fixture.json` - staged paths and stats
- `tests/fixtures/<name>/expected.json` - expected mirror JSON

## Architecture

The application uses a **scroll region approach** to layer UI:
- Sets terminal scroll region (DECSTBM escape sequence) to confine assistant CLI output to the top ~80% of the terminal
- The assistant CLI runs in a PTY and its output passes through untouched within that scroll region
- Status widgets are rendered below the scroll region using raw ANSI escape sequences
- No intermediate rendering library - all drawing is done with direct escape codes

### Key Modules

- **app.rs**: Main application loop and layout management. Handles scroll region setup, event polling, status bar drawing, and PTY passthrough.
- **cli.rs**: Argument parsing, subcommand dispatch, platform resolution.
- **config.rs**: `~/.crabigator/config.toml` loading/saving (platform, IDE, terminal preferences).
- **terminal/**: Terminal handling - `pty.rs` manages the PTY via `portable-pty`, `input.rs` forwards keyboard input, `escape.rs` centralizes all ANSI escape sequences (add new sequences here rather than inline), `osc.rs`/`dsr.rs` handle terminal queries, `redraw.rs` manages repaints.
- **git/**: Git state tracking via `git status --porcelain` and `git diff`.
- **parsers/**: Language-specific diff parsers (Rust, TypeScript, Python, Swift, Objective-C, generic) that extract semantic information (functions, classes, nested scopes) from git diffs. `scope_walker.rs` attributes changes to nested scopes; `summary.rs` builds the changes summary; `permission_prompt.rs`, `question_prompt.rs` (Claude's AskUserQuestion pages: checkboxes, custom text, cursor row, and the "Review your answers" page, mirrored to the dashboard) and `suggestion.rs` parse assistant screen content.
- **platforms/**: Platform abstraction layer:
  - `claude_code/`: Claude Code hooks (`stats_hook.py`, `hook_script.rs`) and transcript parsing (writes to `~/.claude/crabigator/`)
  - `codex_cli/`: Codex CLI session log and transcript parsing (reads `~/.codex/sessions`)
  - `opencode/`: opencode integration. Spawns the CLI with `--port` and follows the server's SSE `/event` stream for state, permissions, and the model; writes a normalized transcript log to `/tmp/crabigator-opencode-{session_id}.jsonl` for scrollback, recaps, and PR tracking. opencode's full-screen TUI runs on the alternate screen, which crabigator strips (see `ScrollRegionFilter`) so it paints inside the scroll region on the primary buffer.
  - `grok/`: Grok Build TUI integration. Spawns `grok` (found in `~/.grok/bin` if needed). Full-screen TUI is stripped onto the primary buffer like opencode. State comes from `~/.grok/sessions/<encoded-cwd>/<id>/events.jsonl` and the transcript from `updates.jsonl`; no hooks are installed.
- **hooks/**: `SessionStats` for session time tracking and platform stats integration.
- **ui/**: Status bar rendering - `status_bar.rs` orchestrates layout; `git.rs`, `changes.rs`, `stats.rs` are the individual widgets; `handoff.rs` is the strip above the widgets (setup prompts, update notices, latest recap, tracked PRs); `pr_cells.rs` is the PR cell rendering shared by the handoff strip and the PR board; `pairing.rs` renders full-width pairing/update banners; `sparkline.rs` renders Unicode sparklines.
- **cloud/**: Streaming to the configured cloud origin - endpoint selection, host-scoped device identity, session registration, event queue, and WebSocket connection with auto-reconnect.
- **capture.rs**: Output capture. Writes the session transcript to `scrollback.log` (from platform JSONL) and periodic screen snapshots to `screen.txt`.
- **mirror.rs**: Widget state mirroring. Publishes throttled JSON snapshots of all widget state to `inspect.json`.
- **inspect.rs**: `crabigator inspect` implementation for viewing other running instances.
- **recap.rs**: Automatic per-turn recaps, generated on the desktop from local transcripts; only the finished recap is sent to the cloud.
- **pr.rs / pr_rank.rs**: GitHub PR tracking for the recap - scrapes the turn transcript for PR mentions, enriches via `gh pr view`, and classifies PRs as primary or secondary.
- **prs_board.rs**: The `crabigator prs` cross-session PR board - reads every live session's `inspect.json`, groups PRs by repository, and renders the interactive board (search, detail levels, live/cloud toggle).
- **slack.rs**: Captures Slack permalinks mentioned in session transcripts so PRs and recaps can link back to their Slack threads.
- **mode.rs**: Detects Claude Code's operating mode (Normal, Auto-Accept, Plan) from screen content.
- **title.rs**: Automatic Claude/Codex title handling and official session-title selection from the primary PR.
- **update.rs**: Auto-update checks via the GitHub Releases API (npm, cargo, homebrew install methods).
- **ide.rs / launcher.rs / terminal_spawner.rs**: IDE hyperlink URLs (OSC 8), macOS crabigator:// URL handler, and new-terminal-window spawning.
- **pair.rs**: Pairing code generation for dashboard auto-login.
- **banner.rs**: Styled session start/end banners.

### Module Organization

This codebase uses `folder.rs` files instead of `folder/mod.rs` for module roots (Rust 2018+ style). For example:
- `src/ui.rs` is the module root for `src/ui/` (not `src/ui/mod.rs`)
- `src/terminal.rs` is the module root for `src/terminal/`

This keeps module declarations visible at the top level rather than buried in subdirectories.

### Input Handling

- All keyboard input forwards directly to the PTY
- Option/Alt key combinations are properly encoded for word navigation (Option+Left/Right) and word deletion (Option+Backspace/Delete)
- When the assistant CLI exits, Crabigator exits automatically

### Terminal Considerations

- Uses primary screen buffer (not alternate screen) to preserve native scrollback
- Mouse capture is disabled to allow native text selection
- Bracketed paste is enabled for efficient paste handling
- Panic handler restores terminal state to prevent corruption

### Session Directory

Each crabigator session creates `/tmp/crabigator-{session_id}/` containing:
- **scrollback.log**: Session transcript (append-only, built from the platform's JSONL log)
- **screen.txt**: Current screen snapshot from the vt100 parser (updated ~100ms)
- **inspect.json**: Widget state for external inspection (updated ~1s when changed)
- **hooks.log**: Debug log of hook invocations (Claude Code)

The session directory path is shown in the startup banner in debug builds (`cargo build`), but hidden in release builds.

Use `--no-capture` to disable output capture (scrollback.log and screen.txt).

**Claude Code Session UUID Symlink:**

On the first hook event, crabigator creates a symlink from the Claude Code conversation UUID to the session directory:
```
/tmp/crabigator-{claude_uuid} -> /tmp/crabigator-{crabigator_id}
```

This allows accessing the session directory using either ID. The Claude session UUID is also stored in the stats file as `claude_session_id`.

### Session IDs: Finding a Session From Any ID

A session has three identifiers, and **each one is a directory under `/tmp`** — the crabigator ID (canonical), the assistant conversation UUID (symlinked by the hook), and the cloud/streaming ID (symlinked once cloud registration succeeds).

**When the user gives you a bare ID with no label** — like `ab9b47bb` or `e881821b` — it is almost always the **streaming ID** shown in the status bar as `Streaming ab9b47bb`, which is only the **first 8 characters** of the full cloud session ID. Resolve it with a prefix glob, then read `transcript_path` out of `inspect.json`:

```bash
ID=ab9b47bb
ls -d /tmp/crabigator-$ID*                          # → the session directory (a symlink)
jq -r '.transcript_path, .session_id, .cwd' /tmp/crabigator-$ID*/inspect.json
```

`inspect.json` carries `session_id`, `cloud_session_id`, and `transcript_path`, so any one ID leads to the others and to the assistant's JSONL conversation log (`~/.claude/projects/…` or `~/.codex/sessions/…`).

If the glob finds nothing, the session predates the cloud symlink or never registered. Fall back to searching by content:

```bash
grep -l "$ID" /tmp/crabigator-*/inspect.json                             # ID recorded in a mirror
grep -rl "distinctive phrase from the session" ~/.claude/projects ~/.codex/sessions
```

`crabigator inspect` reports each session once, under its canonical directory, even though all three aliases match the glob.

### Self-Inspection (for Claude Code)

When running inside crabigator, Claude Code can inspect its own session using the conversation UUID (visible in the Claude Code UI or provided by the user):

```bash
cat /tmp/crabigator-{uuid}/screen.txt      # Current screen
cat /tmp/crabigator-{uuid}/scrollback.log  # Conversation transcript
cat /tmp/crabigator-{uuid}/inspect.json    # Widget state (stats, git status, etc.)
cat /tmp/crabigator-{uuid}/hooks.log       # Hook event log
```

### Instance Inspection

Use `crabigator inspect` to view other running instances:
- `crabigator inspect` - list all instances
- `crabigator inspect /path` - filter by working directory
- `crabigator inspect --watch` - continuous monitoring
- `crabigator inspect --raw` - output raw JSON
- `crabigator inspect --history` - show hook event history for debugging

### Claude Code Hooks

Crabigator installs Python hooks into Claude Code's `~/.claude/settings.json` to track session state (thinking, permission, complete, etc.) and statistics.

**Hook files:**
- `~/.claude/crabigator/stats-hook.py` - The Python hook script
- `~/.claude/crabigator/hooks-meta.json` - Version metadata for change detection
- `/tmp/crabigator-stats-{session_id}.json` - Per-session stats written by hooks
- `/tmp/crabigator-{session_id}/hooks.log` - Debug log of hook invocations

**Hook versioning:**
- Hooks are versioned by both `HOOK_VERSION` (from Cargo.toml) and an MD5 hash of the script content
- On startup, crabigator checks if installed hooks match the current version/hash
- If mismatched or missing, hooks are automatically reinstalled

**Updating hooks:**
1. Edit `src/platforms/claude_code/stats_hook.py` (the Python script)
2. Run `make reinstall-hooks` to clear the version metadata (REQUIRED after any edit!)
3. Start a new crabigator session - hooks will be reinstalled automatically

**IMPORTANT:** Always run `make reinstall-hooks` after editing the hook script!

**Debugging hooks:**
```bash
crabigator inspect --history ~/projects  # View event history and hooks.log
cat /tmp/crabigator-{session}/hooks.log  # Raw hook invocation log
```

**Hook events handled:**
- `UserPromptSubmit` → state = thinking
- `PermissionRequest` → state = permission (or question if AskUserQuestion, plan if ExitPlanMode)
- `PostToolUse` → state = thinking (tracks tool counts)
- `Stop` → state = complete (or question if AskUserQuestion was used)
- `SubagentStop`, `PreCompact` → increment counters

## Cloud Infrastructure

```

### Commands

```bash
make deploy      # Deploy to Cloudflare
make typecheck   # TypeScript type checking
make dev         # Local dev server
```

Project slash commands exist for common flows: `/deploy`, `/commit-push-deploy`, and `/release` (see `.claude/commands/`).

### Key Notes

- **Dashboard**: HTML assembled in `dashboard.ts` with `ansiToHtml()` for terminal rendering
- **256-color**: Uses xterm formula `value = idx === 0 ? 0 : idx * 40 + 55`
- **Deploys break WebSockets**: Desktop auto-reconnects with exponential backoff (1s-30s)
- **Session state**: Managed by Durable Objects (`SessionDO` per session, `SessionListDO` for the roster, `UsageDO` for usage tracking)
- **Auth**: Desktop device_id + HMAC-SHA256 signatures; optional staff tools use a shared-key login and KV sessions
- **SVG Icons**: NEVER inline SVG icons in TypeScript template files. Keep all SVG icons in dedicated `icons.ts` files (`src/landing/icons.ts`, `src/dashboard/icons.ts`), export them as named string constants, and import where needed. For favicons, use URL-encoded versions (with `%23` for `#` in colors).

### Usage Analytics

```bash
make cf-usage    # Show Cloudflare usage stats and scaling capacity
```

Queries the Cloudflare GraphQL API for worker requests, Durable Objects, and D1 usage. Script at `scripts/cf-usage.sh` reads the wrangler OAuth token automatically. Related: `make reset-usage` (clear today's usage rows) and `make sync-usage GROUP=<group_id>`.

### Querying the D1 Database

The D1 binding is `DB`. The official deployment's config is the tracked
`workers/crabigator-api/wrangler.production.jsonc`; the tracked
`workers/crabigator-api/wrangler.example.jsonc` is the public template, and a
self-hosted copy lives in the ignored `workers/crabigator-api/wrangler.jsonc`.

The official account is not the default wrangler profile, so pass its profile
with `--profile` (the `/deploy` command carries the name). Use `WRANGLER_CONFIG`
and `WRANGLER_PROFILE` with the `make` targets for the same reason.

```bash
# Query production database
wrangler d1 execute DB --remote --config workers/crabigator-api/wrangler.production.jsonc --profile <official-profile> --command "SELECT * FROM page_views LIMIT 5"

# Example: Traffic sources by referrer domain
wrangler d1 execute DB --remote --config workers/crabigator-api/wrangler.production.jsonc --profile <official-profile> --command "
SELECT referrer_domain, COUNT(DISTINCT visitor_id) as visitors
FROM page_views
WHERE created_at > strftime('%s', 'now', '-30 days')
GROUP BY referrer_domain
ORDER BY visitors DESC"
```

Key tables: `page_views`, `analytics_events`, `funnel_events`, `email_signups`, `npm_downloads`, `daily_usage`, `devices`, `accounts`, `account_identities`.

## MCP server

Hosted at `https://drinkcrabigator.com/mcp` (same Worker; self-hosted deploys get `/mcp` too). MCP clients use OAuth 2.1: GitHub or Google login, then a pairing code from `crabigator pair` if no desktop is attached yet. The access token is a viewer token for the account's device group.

Tools cover the dashboard: list and inspect sessions, screen and scrollback, prompts, recaps, the PR board, send input, choose prompt options, keys, spawn, voice transcription, and PR dispositions. `wait_for_attention` blocks until a session is in `question` or `permission`. Sessions that never stream to the cloud are invisible, same as the website.

Connect with the MCP inspector or any remote MCP client using `https://drinkcrabigator.com/mcp`. Local inspect.json remains `crabigator inspect`.

## Browser Testing

Use the Chrome browser automation tools (Claude-in-Chrome MCP) to test the dashboard and landing page visually.

### Dashboard Auto-Login

Automated browser sessions have no cookies. To authenticate:

1. **Generate a pairing code:**
   ```bash
   crabigator pair          # or: cargo run --release -- pair
   # Output: ABC-DEF-GHI
   ```
2. **Navigate to the dashboard with the setup parameter:**
   ```
   https://drinkcrabigator.com/dashboard?setup=ABC-DEF-GHI
   ```

The dashboard auto-claims the code and authenticates. Codes expire in 5 minutes and can only be claimed once; the `pair` command validates cached codes and generates new ones when needed. A page snapshot after navigating should show the session list — "Setup Failed" means the code was stale, so run `crabigator pair` again.

**Single-session view** - filter to one session for focused testing (hides Style/Account buttons, forces single-column layout):
```
https://drinkcrabigator.com/dashboard?session=SESSION_ID
```

## E2E Testing with tmux

Agents can spawn and control Crabigator instances for end-to-end testing using tmux. This generates real assistant sessions whose output can be verified locally or on the dashboard. A scripted Codex flow exists as `make e2e-codex-tmux` (`scripts/e2e-codex-tmux.sh`).

### Basic Workflow

```bash
# 1. Start crabigator in a detached tmux session
tmux new-session -d -s crab "cd /path/to/test/project && crabigator"

# 2. Wait for startup
sleep 3

# 3. Send a prompt
tmux send-keys -t crab "explain this codebase" Enter

# 4. Wait for processing, then inspect
sleep 5
cat /tmp/crabigator-*/screen.txt
cat /tmp/crabigator-*/scrollback.log

# 5. Clean up
tmux kill-session -t crab
```

### Codex tmux Workflow (No Browser)

When the user says "run end-to-end test with tmux", default to this Codex flow:

1. Start Codex in tmux: `tmux new-session -d -s crab-e2e "cd /path/to/project && crabigator codex"`.
2. Confirm the session directory from startup output (debug builds show `/tmp/crabigator-<id>/`) or by reading the newest `inspect.json`.
3. Trigger a permission prompt by asking Codex to run a command that requires escalation; verify `inspect.json` state becomes `permission` and the pane shows the approval menu.
4. Answer the permission prompt from tmux (approve or deny) and verify state transitions back out of `permission`.
5. Trigger `request_user_input`; if it is available, verify `question` behavior and answer via tmux; if unavailable in Default mode, verify the attempted tool call and the "unavailable" tool output in the Codex JSONL log.
6. Validate everything via local files only (`inspect.json`, `screen.txt`, `scrollback.log`, `~/.codex/sessions/...jsonl`) without opening a web browser.

### Special Keys

```bash
tmux send-keys -t crab Escape "[" "Z"   # Shift+Tab (mode cycling)
tmux send-keys -t crab Escape           # Escape
tmux send-keys -t crab Tab              # Tab
tmux send-keys -t crab Up               # Arrow keys (Up/Down/Left/Right)
```

### Inspecting Output

**Local files** (in `/tmp/crabigator-*/`): `screen.txt`, `scrollback.log`, `inspect.json`.

**Dashboard** (via browser tools): navigate to `https://drinkcrabigator.com/dashboard` (see Browser Testing above for auth), then take a snapshot or screenshot to verify session state, screen preview, and widgets.

### Profiling Startup

`crabigator --profile claude` prints a startup trace after the session ends: one timestamped line per phase (hook check, PTY spawn, first assistant output, cloud registration, pairing, update check). Add a line anywhere with `crate::cli::profile_mark("label")`; it is a no-op without `--profile`.

Nothing on the startup path may wait on the network. Cloud registration, the pairing code, and the live update check all run as background tasks and are adopted by the main loop's startup poll, so the assistant's first screen appears as fast as it does without Crabigator. To measure in tmux: start `crabigator --profile claude` in a detached session with `remain-on-exit` on, poll `tmux capture-pane` until the assistant prompt appears, send `/exit`, then read the trace from the pane. The "assistant prompt reached terminal" line should land within roughly 100ms of "first bytes from assistant CLI".

## Code Quality

After completing code changes, use the code-simplifier agent to clean up the code:

```
Use the Task tool with subagent_type="code-simplifier:code-simplifier" to review and simplify recent changes
```

The code simplifier will:
- Remove unused CSS classes, variables, and functions
- Clean up dead code and redundant logic
- Simplify overly complex patterns
- Preserve all functionality

## Commit Practices

Commit messages follow the ISO 24495-1 plain language rules above: plain-words imperative subject, most important information first, body explains why.

Split changes into separate logical commits rather than one large commit. Each commit should represent a single coherent change:

- **One feature/fix per commit**: If you added a debug display feature AND fixed a bug, those should be separate commits
- **Separate by layer**: Rust changes vs Worker/TypeScript changes should generally be separate commits
- **Group related files**: Files that work together for a single feature go in the same commit

Example of good commit splitting:
```
ad3b290 Show session ID next to Streaming status in debug builds
6a4613b Add auto-retry for failed cloud registration
a3e4927 Verify desktop connection before marking sessions as zombie
deb5b0e Use D1 as source of truth for active sessions in dashboard
```

Each commit should:
- Be buildable/deployable on its own (no broken intermediate states)
- Be easy to revert independently if needed

## Releasing a New Version

Use the `/release` command (`.claude/commands/release.md`) - it covers version selection, bumps, tagging, release notes, npm verification, and Worker deployment. Release notes and the GitHub release description follow the ISO 24495-1 plain language rules above: highlights lead with user-visible outcomes in plain words, and every section is written for a reader deciding whether to upgrade. Key invariants if releasing manually:

1. **Version sync is CI-enforced**: `Cargo.toml` and `npm/package.json` must carry the same version. Commit the bump ("Bump version to X.Y.Z"), push, then tag `vX.Y.Z` and push the tag.
2. **Watch the workflow**: `gh run list --limit 1` then `gh run watch <run-id>`.
3. **Verify assets**: `gh release view vX.Y.Z` should show 6 assets (darwin/linux tar.gz and win32 zip, each for arm64 and x64).
4. **If the release fails** (usually version mismatch): delete the tag locally and remotely (`git tag -d vX.Y.Z && git push origin --delete vX.Y.Z`), fix the mismatch, commit, re-tag, and push again. Never overwrite a published tag.
5. **Clean up drafts**: failed workflows may leave draft releases. `gh release list` to check; `gh release edit vX.Y.Z --draft=false` to publish or `gh release delete vX.Y.Z --yes` to remove.
