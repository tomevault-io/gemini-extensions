# nulnul harness working agreement

This repository builds `plugins/nulnul-harness/`, a Codex plugin that finds proven capabilities, assembles the smallest useful project-local agent system, completes the user's work, and evolves it from measured outcomes without requiring users to operate a harness.

- Treat `plugins/nulnul-harness/` as the only shipped product boundary.
- Keep the plugin skills-only until a real workflow proves that an MCP server, hook, app, or external service is necessary.
- Inspect a target repository before asking questions. Ask only for product decisions or constraints that cannot be discovered safely. A request to set the harness up on a repository that already has work is never one of those questions.
- Detect the host surface before writing setup files, and enumerate its installed skills, plugins, and agents before claiming a job is covered; on Claude Code adoption, first run the bounded `claude plugin list --json` command instead of inferring installed plugins from the session catalog. Treat Claude's `source=git` as public GitHub provenance only when the exact repository URL also matches.
- Give each host its own root session entry: Codex owns only `AGENTS.md`, Claude Code owns only `CLAUDE.md`, and both point to the same `docs/nulnul/` contract and exactly one live-state writer. On sequential host adoption, preserve the inactive entry byte-for-byte; do not claim concurrent mutation support.
- Upgrade an existing agent roster in place. Classify every existing role as kept, upgraded, merged, or removed; never recreate one that already exists.
- Search installed, official, curated, and reputable public capabilities before creating a project-local substitute. Verify fit, provenance, compatibility, maintenance, permissions, and license; popularity alone is not verification.
- Continue the user's original task after setup; setup alone is not task completion.
- Add every necessary, non-overlapping capability, but activate only what the current task needs.
- Prefer direct or single-agent execution. Add roles only from concrete independent work or verification boundaries, with one synthesis owner.
- Never register global tools, use credentials, deploy, or publish without explicit user approval.
- Keep generated setup removable. Accept an evolution only when a reproducible before/after check improves the primary outcome without violating guardrails, and observe one live cycle after promotion with an executable automatic rollback threshold; schema-v3/v4 states must run the shipped rollback executor before final validation.
- Keep ordinary resume context bounded: compact closed evolution history into the digest-bound adjacent archive, validate deterministic full-state reconstruction, and query rejected history only when a matching proposal needs it.
- Give durable projects one validated concise resume checkpoint; keep stable setup evidence outside the host-loaded entry, and convert every reproducible nonpass verdict into Coach feedback and one bounded proposal in the same run.
- Allow fast resume only from an explicitly verified checkpoint; machine-link every nonpass verdict to its feedback and proposal, and migrate legacy durable contracts without creating a second live-state writer.
- Version concise checkpoint shapes explicitly, fail release on a missing learning-verdict inventory, and restore all earlier project files when a migration replacement fails.
- Give every state file one writing process, keep `unknown` distinct from `verified` and `failed`, persist cursors on empty cycles, and prove each validity check against a negative control.
- Store checkpoint completion as an exact command, execute that field before verified fast resume, and require sanitized machine-valid evidence before a paid runtime result contributes Release Gate points.
- Fail release on a recorded setup, workflow, activation, or fast-path regression; use version-independent champion/candidate evidence, counterbalance paired order, prefer relative budgets to absolute token ceilings, and keep fast resume inside its checkpoint and directly needed task files.
- Before pushing a version-changing commit to `main`, require exact-version public Claude adoption evidence and, when personal or cross-project reuse changes, sanitized apply/skip/revocation or Meta adoption evidence; otherwise use a non-main publication candidate first. Never knowingly leave `main` red while calling the release work complete. After any approved push, watch the resulting CI to green before reporting completion.
- Treat evaluation exposure as state: preregister a frozen candidate before one-shot holdout use, retire every used holdout, reject leakage or recycling, compare a simple retry/selection baseline, and activate Generalization Gate only for personal/core transfer claims rather than ordinary project-local changes.
- Bound autonomous evolution before generation: one reproduced feedback item, `WHERE`/`WHY` pathology, one generation, a small candidate/evaluation/model budget, rejected-archive lookup, deterministic independent credit, sealed holdouts, permission-safe execution, a fair retry baseline on model invocations or deterministic completion checks, and an explicit stop reason including `NO_PROMOTION`.
- For capability-authority feedback, distinguish a missing explicit role boundary from a proven user or project decision override; keep the current capability contract when a bounded candidate has no reproducible advantage.
- Keep personal evolution opt-in and adaptation-only: require a user-selected existing local home, preregister representative transfer plus a negative skip, let an independent Personal Gate promote or narrow, compatibility-check every new project, and fail closed on private data, missing permission, duplicate identity, conflict, stale or revoked status. Never copy raw project memory across repositories.
- Begin cross-project selection only after three independent Personal-Gate-verified mechanism families exist. Aggregate typed privacy-safe summaries inside the approved Personal Home boundary, preserve failed transfers and `unknown` relations, and never count renamed variants or cloned fixtures as independent evidence.
- Freeze one bounded meta-selection candidate before a fresh HOLDOUT, compare flat and simple baselines, retire every used case, credit only downstream apply/skip/conflict and completion results, and let an independent Meta Gate decide promotion, rejection, no advantage, narrower scope, or rollback.
- After a test, rejection, promotion, or user correction produces a durable reusable lesson, read `.nulnul.local.json`; when its approved `obsidian_wiki_root` exists, follow that vault's `00_위키-작업규칙.md`, read `index.md` first, update the relevant `projects/nulnul-harness/` pages and links, then append one entry to `log.md`. Skip routine passing runs and never copy raw transcripts, secrets, personal data, or code facts that the repository already owns. Treat this as the user's standing approval only for that configured vault path.
- Update the harness documents and locale-parity claims in the same change as the code or release evidence they describe.

Validate product changes with:

The documentation-debt check uses Git commit order for tracked documents and only falls back to a repository modification-time scan when Git history is unavailable.

```bash
python3 scripts/pack_plugin.py
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_product_plugin.py' -v
python3 plugins/nulnul-harness/skills/nulnul-harness/scripts/check_doc_debt.py .
```

For release-evidence changes, also run the full `test_*.py` suite and `python3 scripts/release_gate.py`.
