Operational notes for future Codex sessions in this repository.

## Project Snapshot

Maclock is ESP32-S3 firmware for replacing a Maclock's original screen with a
320x240 IPS display. It has two mutually exclusive runtime modes:

- A normal LVGL clock interface with startup animation, MP3 effects, RTC and
  weather data, touch calibration, and persistent brightness/boot settings.
- A Mini vMac emulator that can launch from Boot Options or directly at
  power-on when the saved default selects the emulator.

Main stack:

- PlatformIO with the Arduino framework and the `lolin_s3` environment.
- TFT_eSPI for the ILI9341 display.
- LVGL 9 for the normal clock UI.
- LittleFS for images, sounds, the Mini vMac ROM, and disk images.
- FreeRTOS tasks for input polling, MP3 decoding, and emulator rendering.
- A generated Mini vMac 36.04 source tree plus tracked ESP32 glue.

## Runtime Shape

`src/main.cpp` is a minimal Arduino adapter. Its static `MaclockApp` delegates
`setup()` to `begin()` and `loop()` to `tick()`; `MaclockApp` owns the boot
decision and service graph.

- It initializes NVS preferences, LittleFS, the TFT, and touch first.
- Holding the clock button at boot requests the boot-options UI.
- Otherwise, the saved `floppy_emulator` preference calls `minivmac()`
  immediately, independently of the physical floppy switch.
- Mini vMac runs synchronously. Its Clock+Alarm safe-exit chord returns from
  the call, after which the LVGL clock stack is initialized and Boot Options
  opens.
- The normal path initializes the ES8311 codec, LVGL, LittleFS's LVGL driver,
  UI assets, RTC, encoder, input/audio tasks, and weather sensor.
- `MaclockApp::tick()` then runs the UI state machine, can call `minivmac()`
  again from Boot Options, and remains the only owner of LVGL calls.
- In the normal clock state, holding Clock+Alarm for two seconds opens Boot
  Options; a Clock-only press opens date/time editing on release.

Do not try to run the clock UI and Mini vMac concurrently unless the user
explicitly asks for an architectural change. They share the display, touch,
LittleFS, and boot lifecycle.

## Important Files

- `platformio.ini`: board, libraries, pin assignments, TFT configuration,
  optimization flags, emulator include paths, and generated-source filters.
- `partitions.csv`: one 3 MiB application partition and a large LittleFS
  partition.
- `prepare.sh`: downloads and extracts Mini vMac 36.04, applies tracked
  patches, and downloads ignored ROM/disk images when absent.
- `src/main.cpp`: the under-50-line Arduino adapter.
- `include/maclock_app.h`, `src/maclock_app.cpp`: composition root, owned
  services, typed state, event sink, and private UI callback context.
- `src/ui/*.cpp`: focused Boot Options, clock-face, shared-shell, asset, and
  state-machine implementation units. They are included into
  `maclock_app.cpp` under `MACLOCK_COMBINED_SOURCE` and intentionally compile
  empty when PlatformIO discovers them separately.
- `include/*_service.h`, matching `src/*.cpp`: settings, I2C, RTC, weather,
  input, display, audio, Wi-Fi, alarm, and timer ownership.
- `include/control_panel.h` and `src/control_panel.cpp`: station-only local
  web controls and JSON routes. This is intentionally separate from the
  captive Wi-Fi setup portal in `wifi_mode.cpp`.
- `web/control-panel/`: responsive Vue source for the classic Macintosh web
  control panel. `scripts/build_control_panel.py` runs as a PlatformIO prebuild
  hook and regenerates the gzip-compressed `src/control_panel_page.h` whenever
  the web-source fingerprint changes. Never hand-edit the generated header.
- `src/init.cpp`: `DisplayService`, including TFT/LVGL, LittleFS LVGL driver,
  ES8311/I2S ownership, and the narrow Mini vMac hardware bridge.
- `src/datetime_ui.cpp`: state-owning date/time editor; it reports RTC changes
  and transitions through `AppEventSink`.
- `src/touch.cpp`, `include/touch.h`: FT6336 coordinate mapping and
  EEPROM-backed four-corner calibration.
- `src/FT6336.cpp`, `include/FT6336.h`: low-level I2C touch-controller driver.
- `include/TouchSensor.h`: discrete GPIO touch/button helper used for wake
  activity and the emulator mouse button.
- `src/es8311.cpp`, `include/es8311*.h`: audio-codec driver.
- `src/minivmac_ArduinoAPI.cpp`, `include/minivmac/ArduinoAPI.h`: Arduino,
  LittleFS, display, memory, time, and touch adapter for Mini vMac.
- `src/minivmac_OSGLUE.c`: tracked Mini vMac host glue for ROM/disk access,
  timing, input, and screen invalidation.
- `include/minivmac/*.h`: tracked generated/configured Mini vMac build
  settings, including the Macintosh Plus model and 304x224 monochrome screen.
- `patches/`: reproducible changes applied to the generated upstream tree.
- `data/`: LittleFS image contents—tracked UI/audio assets plus ignored local
  ROM and `disk*.dsk` files.
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`: deeper system overview.

## Generated And Binary Inputs

`src/minivmac/` is generated by `prepare.sh` and ignored by Git. Do not treat it
as the canonical place for project-specific changes.

- Put reproducible upstream changes in `patches/` and update `prepare.sh` when
  necessary.
- Keep the tracked bridge/configuration files outside the generated subtree in
  sync with any Mini vMac change.
- `prepare.sh` only extracts and patches when `src/minivmac/` does not exist.
  A new patch is not automatically applied to an already prepared tree.
- Do not commit `.pio/`, `src/minivmac/`, downloaded archives, ROMs,
  `disk*.dsk`, or platform metadata such as `.DS_Store` and `._*`.
- ROM and disk images can contain licensed or user-modified data. Never replace,
  delete, publish, or commit them without explicit direction.

## Hardware Contract

Pin assignments live in `platformio.ini`; keep documentation and code aligned
with that file.

| Function | GPIO / address |
| --- | --- |
| TFT SPI | CS 10, MOSI 11, SCLK 12, MISO 13, DC 46, backlight 45 |
| ES8311 I2S | enable 1, MCLK 4, BCLK 5, WS 7, DOUT 8 |
| Shared I2C | SDA 16, SCL 15 |
| FT6336 touch | I2C `0x38`, interrupt 17, reset 18 |
| ES8311 codec | I2C `0x18` |
| BMP580/BMP581 | I2C `0x47` |
| HTU2x | I2C `0x40` |
| DS1307/DS3231 | I2C `0x68` |
| Encoder | 14 and 21 |
| Discrete touch | 2 |
| Floppy / alarm / clock | 47 / 40 / 48 |
| Battery signals | charging 43, enable 44, ADC 9 |

The I2C bus is shared. Preserve `Wire` initialization, the 100 kHz codec setup,
and device-address assumptions when changing any peripheral.

## Display And Input Invariants

- The physical TFT is 320x240 at rotation 3.
- LVGL creates a 304x224 display and flushes it with a 16-pixel top offset,
  leaving the top/right Mac-style border outside the logical canvas.
- Mini vMac is configured for the same 304x224 logical screen and renders it
  into a full 320x240 frame with a 16-pixel top and right border.
- The normal UI uses mapped FT6336 coordinates. Calibration is stored in EEPROM.
- Mini vMac uses raw FT6336 deltas for pointer motion and the discrete
  `TouchSensor` on GPIO 2 as its mouse button.
- Keep all LVGL object mutation on the Arduino loop. The input task should only
  publish edge/state snapshots through `g_input_state_mux`.

## Concurrency

- The `InputService` task runs on core 1 every 20 ms and publishes floppy state plus
  alarm, clock, and touch rising edges.
- The `AudioService` task runs on core 0 and advances the normal-mode MP3
  decoder. Its instance lock protects playback and completion state.
- Emulator mode creates `RenderTask` on core 0. `RenderTaskLock` coordinates
  screen-buffer handoff and `SPIBusLock` serializes emulator display/filesystem
  operations.
- Mini vMac PCM is produced on the calling Arduino task and written
  synchronously through the shared `AudioOutputI2S` object. Clock MP3 playback
  must be stopped while the emulator owns I2S.
- Mini vMac allocates large blocks from PSRAM through the Arduino API.

Do not remove these locks or access service state from another task without
defining a replacement ownership model.

## Persistent Settings And Filesystem

- `SettingsStore` owns namespace `maclock` in `Preferences`, existing keys,
  defaults, and validation. Alarm and Wi-Fi receive its Preferences handle to
  preserve their existing storage formats.
- EEPROM stores FT6336 calibration with the `TOUC` magic value.
- LittleFS paths use `/name` through Arduino and `S:/name` through LVGL.
- Mini vMac expects `/vMac.ROM` and sequential `/disk1.dsk`,
  `/disk2.dsk`, and so on, stopping at the first missing disk number.
- The normal boot diagnostic expects the codec, touch controller, one detected
  weather sensor, and RTC. A missing expected plugin deliberately enters an
  infinite red-blink diagnostic.

Avoid renaming assets or emulator images without updating every lookup and the
README/upload workflow.

## Build And Verification

Prepare a fresh checkout before the first build:

```bash
./prepare.sh
```

Use PlatformIO for builds:

```bash
pio run -e lolin_s3
pio run -e lolin_s3 -t buildfs
```

If `pio` is not on `PATH`, use `~/.platformio/penv/bin/pio`.

There is no automated test suite. For code changes, at minimum run the firmware
build. Also build LittleFS when changing `data/`, partitioning, or filesystem
lookups. Treat hardware validation as separate and report what was not tested.

Do not run upload targets unless the user asks and the intended serial device is
known:

```bash
pio run -e lolin_s3 -t upload
pio run -e lolin_s3 -t uploadfs
pio device monitor -b 115200
```

## Gotchas

- Preserve unrelated dirty work and ignored local ROM/disk assets.
- `prepare.sh` performs network downloads, including non-TLS legacy URLs, and
  has no checksum validation. Do not run it unnecessarily.
- A firmware-only upload does not update LittleFS. Asset changes require a
  filesystem build/upload.
- `LittleFS.begin()` currently mounts without formatting or explicit failure
  handling. Do not add automatic formatting casually; it could erase disks.
- The boot-time `minivmac()` call occurs before codec/LVGL initialization and
  blocks in the emulator main loop until safe exit.
- Mini vMac sound is enabled in `include/minivmac/CNFGGLOB.h`. Its native
  22,255 Hz mono PCM and normal-mode 44.1 kHz MP3 sound share the ES8311 and
  `AudioOutputI2S`; preserve the entry/exit reconfiguration.
- The alarm edge has no Clock-only action, but the normal state polls the Alarm
  level as half of its Boot Options chord. Mini vMac polls Alarm directly as
  Escape and as half of its safe-exit chord.
- The RTC fallback value is `2000-01-01 00:00:00` when no supported RTC is
  active.
- BMP5xx is preferred over HTU2x when both are present. The displayed gauge is
  pressure for BMP5xx and humidity for HTU2x.
- Aggressive `-O3`, `-ffast-math`, no exceptions, and no RTTI are intentional
  emulator-performance settings. Check library compatibility before changing
  them.

## Things To Preserve

- Mutually exclusive display ownership while either the clock UI or emulator
  is active.
- The 304x224 logical display inside the 320x240 physical frame.
- LittleFS path compatibility for both LVGL and Mini vMac.
- The generated/upstream boundary for Mini vMac.
- Persistent user brightness, boot choice, touch calibration, ROM, and disk
  data.
- Single-owner LVGL updates and the existing cross-core synchronization.
