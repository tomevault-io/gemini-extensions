# CLAUDE.md — engine conventions

Always-on guardrails, plus a router to the detail. Keep this file **short**: if
a section here grows past a few lines, it belongs in the topic file instead.

## Docs are implementation rules — the gate on editing them

> **Read this before opening any file in `docs/`. A docs edit that fails this
> gate is a defect, not a contribution.**

`docs/*.md` say **how a thing must be implemented**. They do not describe how the
code works — the code does that, and a prose copy of it rots. Every statement is
a rule an implementer must satisfy, or an external constraint the code cannot
carry.

**The gate: which rule changed?** A commit may touch `docs/` only if the same
commit changes a system contract — a type, a schema field, an engine rule, an
invariant, a convention. If you cannot name the rule that changed, do not touch
`docs/`.

None of these earn a docs edit:

- adding or changing a skill, buff, debuff, mechanic, class, rotation, inner way
- implementing something the docs already state as a rule
- recording that work happened, what it used to be, or who decided it
- an example, a worked walkthrough, or a status / coverage note

1. **Nothing content-specific — `docs/` or the wiki.** No skill, buff, debuff,
   inner way or gear set name or id; no coefficient; no frame count. Examples use
   placeholders. Class names appear only in `docs/CLASSES.md`'s implemented
   table, `docs/TESTING.md`'s scoping rule and `docs/REFERENCE-DATA.md`.
   Mechanically enforced by `tests/data/docsStayGeneral.test.ts`.
2. **Every sentence must hold for every class and skill.** If it is only true of
   one it is not a rule, and it belongs in no docs file at all. Genuinely complex
   per-skill logic gets a short comment in the `.ts` that defines the skill —
   nothing else, nowhere else.
3. **No descriptions of how code works.** No module tours, no folder trees, no
   call-order walkthroughs, no "X then calls Y". If a reader gets it by opening
   the file, it is noise.
4. **No history.** No dates, no decision provenance, no changelog sections.
5. **Adding does not add prose.** If your change made a docs file longer without
   changing a rule, delete what you added.

Every section should read like a checklist: imperative, checkable, no story.

## Read this first, by topic

| working on                                                         | read                     |

| user-visible text, a locale or the translation catalogue           | `docs/I18N.md`           |

## Adding something new — start from the wiki how-to

**Adding** a thing has a step-by-step page; the `docs/` files above explain the
system it plugs into. Read the how-to **first** — it is the ordered file list,
the wiring, the tests to update and the migration question, in one place.

| adding                       | read                          |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| a class or spec              | `How to Add a Class`          |
| a skill                      | `How to Add a Skill`          |
| a rotation                   | `How to Add a Rotation`       |
| a buff, debuff or DoT        | `How to Add a Buff or Debuff` |
| an inner way (mind method)   | `How to Add an Inner Way`     |
| a changelog entry, releasing | `src/changelog/README.md`     |

The changelog how-to is the one that lives in the repo rather than the wiki: it
is read while editing the folder it documents.

The wiki is the [project wiki](https://github.com/M1zuke/where-winds-meet-dps/wiki),
cloned beside this repo at `../where-winds-meet-dps.wiki` — read the `.md` files
there directly. It also carries `Development Setup`, `Architecture Overview`,
`Project Conventions`, `Damage Calculation`, `Testing Guide`,
`Saved Profile Migrations` and `Glossary`.

Two rules keep it trustworthy:

1. **One source per fact.** A rule, a number, a formula and a field name live in
   `docs/` and nowhere else. The wiki carries the ordered procedure and the _why_,
   and links to the `docs/` rule instead of restating it — so the two can never
   disagree. The gate above binds the wiki too: no content names, no examples
   built on a real skill.
2. A change that invalidates a how-to updates that page **in the same piece of
   work**, as its own commit in the wiki clone. A stale how-to is worse than a
   missing one.

The sections below are the rules that apply _before_ you know which topic you're
in — they stay here on purpose, because a pointer you don't know to follow isn't
a guardrail.

## Git workflow — never push to `main`

Nothing is committed or pushed directly to `main`. Every change goes onto a
branch, which is what gets pushed; `main` only moves via merges of those
branches.

## Comments: as close to zero as possible

> **This has been asked for repeatedly, and the bar has moved: the target is not
> "few comments", it is none. Treat a violation as a defect, not a style nit.**

Code describes itself. A comment is a failure to make the code say it, and is
allowed only where the code genuinely cannot:

- **genuinely complex logic** whose _why_ cannot be read off the implementation
- **an external-source citation** — an in-game value, a PDF or CN source, a unit
  on a bare number. Its as-of date is part of the citation, not history.
- **an ordering constraint** that would otherwise get re-broken
- **the previous data shape**, in `src/migrations/**` and storage repair only —
  there the old shape _is_ the specification

Everything else is deleted:

```
// Sort the entries by name.     ← delete, the call already says it
// Bump the retry counter.       ← delete
// Holds the parsed profiles.    ← delete, the name says it
```

And **never** write history:

```
// Removed in <commit> / no longer used since <date>.
// Since 2026-xx-xx the user decided ...
// This used to be inline in the timeline.
// Formerly `armorSetBoni.json`.
```

Git carries the history; it does not belong in the source. When you delete
something, delete every line that referenced it — no tombstones, and no
`@deprecated` marker parked on a field that should simply be gone. Prefer
encoding a constraint in a **test name** over a comment: a test called
`keeps a steady tick cadence across re-application` cannot rot the way a warning
comment can.

This applies to **every file that ships** — source, stylesheets, config, tests,
data, docs — not only the ones where you think of yourself as "writing code".
Whole files with no comments at all are the normal outcome, not a warning sign.
Moving code does not move its comments with it: re-judge each one against this
bar and drop it if it fails, even when you were told to preserve it.

### The comment pass — the last step of every task

**No task is finished until this has run.** When the work is otherwise done and
before you report it, re-read your own diff and judge every comment in it again
— the ones you just wrote included — then delete the ones that fail the bar and
keep the ones that pass. Three questions catch most of them:

1. Is the fact already visible at the call site, or in a name?
2. Is it said twice — in another comment, or in the commit message?
3. Could a **test name** carry it instead?

"It was non-obvious while I was writing it" is not the bar: that preserves the
author's reasoning, not something the reader cannot reconstruct. Shortening a
comment is not the same as re-judging it, and reporting the one as the other
misstates the work. Say in your summary that the pass ran.

## Names say what they hold at their point of use

No `a`, `b`, `x`, `tmp`, no one-letter stand-in for a longer word — locals,
parameters, or imports. `const a = loadProfiles()` is
`const profiles = loadProfiles()`. A name that needs its surrounding line to be
understood is a name to replace, and this outranks any external convention that
prefers brevity.

If you find yourself writing a comment to explain an identifier, fix the
identifier instead.

## Language: English-first — no Chinese in code

The app is **English-only**. There is **no Chinese in `src/` or `tests/`** — not
in identifiers, object keys, comparison literals, enum values, data JSON,
fixtures, or comments. Every domain term uses its official English form
(attributes `Bellstrike`/`Stonesplit`/`Silkbind`/`Bamboocut`, weapons
`Sword`/`Modao`/…, skill types
`weapon`/`mindMethod`/`mystic`/`sustain`/`settlement`/`weaponMystic`, tiers
`tier 6`, and every attunement label — see § "Class-specific attunement map").

Grep guard — must return nothing:

```
grep -rlIP '[\x{4e00}-\x{9fff}]' src tests
```

Use `-P`, not `-E`: `grep -E` doesn't understand `\x{…}` and silently reports
false positives. Keep `-I`: the guard is about source text, and a binary asset
under `src/` will otherwise trip it on bytes that happen to fall in the range.

**The only sanctioned Chinese** is dev-only reference material outside `src/`:
the workbook in `excels/`, its extractions in `reference/workbook/`, the
official ZH↔EN pairs in `reference/locale/zhToEnOfficial.json`, and the four CN
source citations in `docs/CALCULATION.md` § "Sources of truth". None is
imported by the app or the tests.

The UI renders **keys**, not English: a locale is a catalogue under
`src/i18n/locales/` keyed by path and a member of the `Locale` union in
`src/i18n/translations.ts` — nothing else branches on it. `en.json` is the
English catalogue and the fallback every locale falls through to. There is still
**no `zh` locale**.

→ Translatable text, and what makes a string reachable: **docs/I18N.md**.

## White vs Yellow rates — DO NOT FLIP THIS

Two different conventions for the three rates:

|                                         | precision                                    | critRate          | affinityRate      | who uses                                                      |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **White** (raw character)               | from gear/build                              | from gear/build   | from gear/build   | the **UI**: stored on `Inputs`, what the user types           |
| **Yellow** (effective, post-resistance) | `(white − 0.65) / (1 + r) + 0.65` (soft-cap) | `white / (1 + r)` | `white / (1 + r)` | the **formula**: `computeSkillDamage` consumes these directly |

1. `Inputs.precision`, `Inputs.critRate`, `Inputs.affinityRate` are **WHITE**.
   The user types white into the UI. Do not change this.
2. The engine converts to yellow in exactly one place — `panel.ts
effectiveRates` — and feeds yellow into `formula.computeSkillDamage`.
3. **`directCritRate` / `directAffinityRate` are NOT affected by resistance** —
   same value white or yellow.
4. **Building a fixture from yellow reference values** (e.g. a reference site's
   panel)? Convert yellow → white before storing on `Inputs`:
   - `whitePrec = (yellow − 0.65) × (1 + r) + 0.65`
   - `whiteCrit = yellow × (1 + r)`
   - `whiteAffinity = yellow × (1 + r)`
5. `defaults.ts` uses `precision: 1.105`, `critRate: 0.7 × 1.3`,
   `affinityRate: 0.164 × 1.3`. These are white values that round-trip to the
   effective `1.0 / 0.7 / 0.164` at resistance 30. **Don't "simplify" them** to
   the yellow numbers — that breaks the convention.

If you find yourself questioning whether the engine's rates are wrong, check
this section first. The white→yellow conversion is **load-bearing for every
per-tick formula**, and removing it silently passes one fixture while breaking
others.

## localStorage migrations

> **MANDATORY — check this on EVERY change, no exceptions.** Before you call any
> task done, ask: _can a profile already saved in a user's browser be wrong,
> stale, or illegal under this change?_ If yes, the change is **not complete**
> without a migration in the same commit. This is not optional polish and it is
> not a follow-up — a shipped change without its migration silently corrupts
> real user builds, and nothing in the test suite or the type checker will tell
> you. Saved profiles are the one part of this app that can't be regenerated.
>
> Say explicitly in your summary which it was: _"migration added: <what it
> heals>"_ or _"no migration needed: <why saved profiles are unaffected>"_.
> Never leave it unstated.

The check lives here because it fires on changes that **don't look**
storage-related — a narrowed allowlist in a data file, a new UI-only invariant,
a changed default. Deciding you don't need one is a decision you have to make
out loud, every time.

→ How to actually write one, and the full "what counts" list:
**docs/MIGRATIONS.md**.

## Buffs: base-stat buffs vs skill-specific buffs

Classify FIRST — the two categories live in different places, and mixing them up
is how this engine grows a double-count.

> **The dividing question:** does it change the character's _stats_
> (→ stat layer, invisible), or does it change the _damage of specific skills
> only_ (→ a data-driven buff-def, visible in the Skill Editor)?

Never hardcode a per-skill mechanic in `timeline.ts`, and never add a read-only
display wrapper that duplicates an engine constant. One source of truth.

→ Full taxonomy, worked examples, and which system to use: **docs/BUFFS.md**.

## Calculation rules

Three rules apply unconditionally, from the external sources (Midasione PDF +
CN community sources): graze rate `(1−precision)(1−affinity)`; net-pen `÷100`
deficit / `÷200` overflow (corrects PDF §7 — **do not "fix" it back**); a
skill's own rate bonus is added undivided and falls inside the cap, for both
crit and affinity alike, while the direct rate is added outside it. The
martial art's attribute multiplier applies to every row alike, DoT ticks
included, and to a row's flat term together with its coefficient.
Penetration resistance is zero for every target below breakthrough 20, and
non-zero from breakthrough 20 on.

These have no cached anchor — only the directional `damageRules.test.ts`.

→ The reasoning, the sources, and the per-skill gating: **docs/CALCULATION.md**
§ "Calculation rules".

## Ids are the identity; a label is only ever display text

**Nothing keys off a display string.** A stat line, a gear word and an attunement
are each identified by a stable camelCase id; the label is what the UI renders and
is free to be corrected without touching storage, an engine path or a test.

- **Stat lines, gear words and buff-targetable stats** —
  `src/data/stats/statLines.ts` is the only place an id, label, engine path, unit,
  max roll, scope and category are authored. `PATH_LABELS`, `PERCENT_PATHS`,
  `PENETRATION_PATHS`, `GEAR_WORD_MAX_ROLL`, `GEAR_WORD_UNIT`, and
  `statRegistry.ts`'s `StatKey` and `STAT_DEFS` are all **derived** from it —
  never hand-write a second copy. A line with a `maxRoll` is a rollable gear
  word; a line with a `category` is buff-targetable. `GearWordEntry.word` stores
  the id.
- **Class-specific attunements** — `Inputs.classSpecificAttunement` is keyed by
  `AttunementOption.id`, so an option's `enginePath` is exactly
  `classSpecificAttunement.<its own id>`, and each class lists the ids it shows in
  `ClassDef.classSpecificAttunements`. Attunement labels carry the **official
  in-game English Attune Effect name**.

Renaming an **id** is a storage change and needs a migration; renaming a **label**
never is.

## Implemented classes

**Registered and validated are two different things.** A class is registered once
its data is live; it is validated only once its output is checked against a
measured build. `ClassDef.validated` states which, and only a validated class's
numbers may be relied on.

**Bellstrike Umbra (`bellstrikeUmbra`), Bellstrike Splendor (`bellstrikeSplendor`),
Stonesplit Strength (`stonesplitStrength`) and Bamboocut Draught
(`bamboocutDraught`) are validated.** Every other class carries unverified
numbers, whether registered or not.

→ The full class/spec table and what that means for tests: **docs/CLASSES.md**,
**docs/TESTING.md** § "Class scoping".

## Performance: heavy engine work stays off the main thread

A `runEngine` pass is a full 60 fps timeline simulation. **At most ONE
synchronous `runEngine` per input change** — the baseline pass in `App.tsx`'s
`result` memo. Everything else goes through `src/engine/dpsWorker.ts`, debounced.

→ Every rule, the hook pattern, and worker testing: **docs/UI.md**.
