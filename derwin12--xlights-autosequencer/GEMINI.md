## Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install vamp librosa madmom click pytest
brew install ffmpeg  # macOS
# Install Vamp plugin packs from vamp-plugins.org → ~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/Vamp/

# Run analysis
xlight-analyze analyze song.mp3

# View track summary
xlight-analyze summary song_analysis.json

# Export selected tracks
xlight-analyze export song_analysis.json --select beats,drums,bass

# Build the React review UI (required once before using `xlight-analyze review`;
# re-run after frontend changes). The built bundle under
# src/review/frontend/dist/ is git-ignored — rebuild locally, don't commit it.
cd src/review/frontend && npm install && npm run build && cd -

# Launch review UI (opens browser at localhost:5173)
xlight-analyze review song_analysis.json

# Run tests
pytest tests/ -v
```

### Restarting the dev review server after a commit (Docker devcontainer)

The review UI at `localhost:5000` runs inside the `xlight-dev` Docker container
(`docker ps` / `docker exec xlight-dev ps aux`, not a native Windows process).
`/workspace` in the container is a live bind-mount of the repo, so commits are
visible immediately, but the running `xlight-review --dev` process does **not**
hot-reload backend Python changes — it keeps serving whatever it imported at
process start. Before concluding a backend fix "didn't work" when testing
through `localhost:5000`, check the UI's version banner (`ui <commit> · built
<time> · api <commit>`) — if `api` doesn't match the latest commit, restart:

```bash
docker exec xlight-dev pkill -f xlight-review
docker exec -d xlight-dev /usr/bin/python3 /home/node/.local/bin/xlight-review --dev --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5000
```

Git Bash mangles `/usr/bin/...` paths passed to `docker exec` — prefix with
`MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1` if invoking from Git Bash on Windows. Frontend-only
changes need a rebuild first (`cd src/review/frontend && npm run build`) —
the `ui <commit>` banner segment only changes when that bundle is rebuilt;
the restart above is only needed for backend Python changes.

## Desktop App Release Process

Pushing a `v*` git tag (e.g. `v0.1.3`) triggers `.github/workflows/release-windows.yml`,
which builds the Windows installer fresh on a GitHub-hosted runner and attaches it to
a new GitHub Release automatically (`generate_release_notes: true` — no hand-written
release notes needed). `workflow_dispatch` also works for a manual run without a tag,
but that run does not create a release (the "Create GitHub Release" step is gated on
`startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/')`).

To cut a release:

1. Bump the version in **both** `packaging/tauri/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`
   (`"version"`) and `packaging/tauri/src-tauri/Cargo.toml` (`version = "..."`) —
   they are not auto-synced. Run `cargo check` (or any cargo command) once in
   `packaging/tauri/src-tauri` afterward so `Cargo.lock`'s own `xlight` entry picks
   up the new version; commit all three files together.
2. Optionally build+verify locally first (see `packaging/README.md`) — not required,
   since CI does a full clean build anyway, but catches problems faster than waiting
   on a 15-20 min cold CI run.
3. `git push origin main`, then `git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "..."` and `git push origin vX.Y.Z`.
4. Watch the run: `gh run list --workflow=release-windows.yml --limit 3`. A cold
   runner (no warm Cargo/pnpm cache) takes ~15-20+ minutes.

Do **not** commit `packaging/tauri/src-tauri/packaging-manifest.json` after a local
build — `generate-manifest.ps1` overwrites it with real build metadata (version+sha,
timestamp), but the checked-in copy is meant to stay the static `"0.0.0-dev"`
placeholder (see the file's own comment in `packaging/README.md`). `git checkout --`
it before committing if a local build dirtied it.

The default `GITHUB_TOKEN` does not include `contents: write` by default — the
workflow declares `permissions: contents: write` explicitly (added after v0.1.0's
first tagged run built successfully but failed at the release-creation step with
"Resource not accessible by integration"). If a future release run fails at that
same step, check this permission block hasn't been reverted before re-diagnosing
from scratch.

## Segment Classification — Mandatory Changelog Rule

Any change to segment detection, section merging, or section role classification
**must** be logged in `docs/segment-classification-changelog.md` before the change
is considered complete. This includes changes to:

- `src/story/section_classifier.py`
- `src/story/section_merger.py`
- `src/story/builder.py` (section extraction, label handling, or post-processing)
- Any orchestrator code that affects what boundaries are passed to the story builder

**Append only — never remove old entries.** The log exists to prevent going in circles
on classification logic. Read it before making any changes to understand what has
already been tried and why.

### Boundary refinement (post-classification step)

After roles are assigned and merged, the story builder runs a lyric-anchored
boundary-refinement pass (`src/story/boundary_refinement.py`) that adjusts
section edges using audio-level vocal evidence. It consumes WhisperX forced
alignment word marks (already produced for Genius alignment) plus a
free-transcription word stream from `src/analyzer/free_transcription.py`
(WhisperX without Genius), and applies three targeted fixes in fixed order:
(1) merging short low-agreement `post_chorus` tails back into the preceding
chorus thought when the audio is continuous, (2) relabel-or-split of
"bridge" sections that actually contain the chorus's first-line distinctive
hook, and (3) splitting an instrumental lead-in off the front of a vocal
section when there is a long silence before the first audible word. Every
section gains a `boundary_refinements: list[str]` field (empty when nothing
fires); `_story.json` schema is `1.1.0`. See
`openspec/changes/lyric-anchored-boundary-refinement/` for the full design,
preconditions, and 16-song corpus results.

## Code Style

- Follow PEP 8
- Type hints on all public functions and class attributes
- Each algorithm class inherits from `base.Algorithm` and implements `run(audio_array, sample_rate) -> TimingTrack`
- Timestamps are always stored as integers (milliseconds) — never floats

## Recent Changes
- 052-tauri-desktop-packaging: Added Python 3.11+ (backend, sidecar); TypeScript 5+ / ES2022 (frontend); Rust 1.75+ (Tauri shell, compiled as part of `tauri build`, not hand-written Rust feature code) + Tauri 2.x; existing Flask 3+, React 18+, Zustand 4+, Vite 5+ (frontend, unchanged); existing analyzer stack (librosa, madmom, vamp, torch, ffmpeg). New build-time only: `pyinstaller` 6+, `@tauri-apps/cli`, Apple `notarytool` (bundled with Xcode).
- 051-x-onset-frontend: Added Python 3.11+ (backend), TypeScript 5+ / ES2022 (frontend) + Flask 3+ (backend web server, existing); React 18+, Zustand 4+, Vite 5+, TypeScript 5+ (frontend). No UI framework (no Tailwind, no shadcn/ui, no Chakra) — design tokens ported directly from [design_handoff_xonset/prototype/state.jsx](../../design_handoff_xonset/prototype/state.jsx) as CSS custom properties consumed by CSS Modules.
- 041-prop-type-affinity: Added Python 3.11+ + No new dependencies — all existing generator pipeline
  `htdemucs_6s` separates audio into 6 stems (drums, bass, vocals, guitar, piano, other).
  Algorithms route to their preferred stem via `Algorithm.preferred_stem` class attribute.
  Stems are MD5-cached in `.stems/<hash>/` adjacent to the source file. Each `TimingTrack`
  carries a `stem_source` field. The `summary` command shows a `Stem` column. The review UI
  shows a stem badge on each track lane. New module: `src/analyzer/stems.py`.

  madmom produce 22 named timing tracks from a single MP3. Quality-scored JSON output
  with `--top N` auto-selection and manual track selection/export via CLI.
  serves a single-page Canvas+Web Audio app for visualizing timing tracks, synchronized
  playback, Next/Prev/Solo focus navigation, and filtered JSON export.
  with no args shows an upload page; SSE streams per-algorithm progress; browser auto-navigates
  to timeline when done. Vamp/madmom toggles on upload page.

## Future Work / TODOs

### Use uploaded .xtiming as boundary-refinement input (preferred over synced-lyrics fetch)
- User-confirmed follow-up (2026-08-08) to the synced-lyrics disk-cache fix
  (bug-804, see docs/segment-classification-changelog.md's 2026-08-08 entry)
  — "using the xtiming, when provided is a good solution to implement."
  User wants to test the disk-cache fix first before this is built.
- The gap: `build_song_story()` (drives `boundary_refinement.py` Fix 1/2)
  runs at `analysis.py:547`, completely independent of the `.xtiming`
  override, which is only read later in the same function
  (`analysis.py:739`) and only feeds Faces/Text-effect word tracks
  downstream. A user's uploaded `.xtiming` currently has zero influence on
  section classification.
- Why this is a real improvement, not just an alternative: the network
  synced-lyrics path (`fetch_synced_lyrics` → `lines_to_word_marks`) only
  has LRC line-level timestamps and evenly splits each line's duration
  across its words — a crude approximation. A user's `.xtiming` has real,
  word-accurate timing (that's the point of uploading it), so when
  available it's a strictly better `forced_marks` source than the network
  fetch, with zero network dependency. `chorus_body` (used by Fix 2 to
  catch a mislabeled bridge) can equally be derived from the `.xtiming`'s
  own phrase/line layer (`parse_xtiming_lyrics`'s "lines" output,
  `src/analyzer/xtiming_import.py`) instead of LRC text — same shape of
  data (text + timing per line).
- Proposed approach: thread the xtiming override into `build_song_story`
  (new parameter, e.g. `xtiming_words_override`/`xtiming_lines_override`)
  and prefer it over both `lyrics_text_override` and the disk-cached/fresh
  network fetch when present. The now-cached network-fetch path (bug-804)
  becomes the fallback for songs without a user-supplied `.xtiming`, not
  the primary path for everyone.
- Touches the same files as bug-804 (`src/story/builder.py`,
  `src/analyzer/`, `src/review/api/v1/analysis.py`) — needs the same
  Design-First Gate treatment before implementation.

### Section-Classifier Debug Timing Track
- User request (2026-08-08), arising from a real investigation: "why did
  Moving Head effects place at 4:20s, right near the end of the song?"
  Diagnosing it required manually cross-referencing three separate sources —
  the exported "Sections" role-label timing track in the `.xsq`, the raw
  `place_moving_head_pattern_accents` placement logic in
  `src/generator/moving_head.py`, and finally `docker exec`-ing into the
  devcontainer to read `character.energy_score` straight out of the song's
  `_story.json` — a ~20-minute archaeology dig to confirm the outro section
  (254.6-265.5s) legitimately scored `energy_score: 0` (vocals inactive,
  guitar-only tail-out) rather than being a scoring bug.
- Proposal: an optional debug timing track (e.g. `"Section Debug"`, gated
  behind a `GenerationConfig` flag so it's off by default and doesn't
  clutter a normal export) with one mark per section labeled with its role
  + `energy_score` + `energy_level` (e.g. `outro E=0 (low)`), built
  alongside the existing "Sections"/"Themes" timing tracks in
  `src/generator/xsq_writer.py` (see `_section_role_marks`/
  `_section_theme_marks` for the existing precedent this would extend).
  Would turn this exact class of question into a 10-second look at the
  timeline instead of a multi-source manual dig.
- Touches `src/generator/` (shared module) — needs the full Design-First
  Gate before implementation, not yet designed.

### Intelligent Effect Rotation (Tier 6-7)
- Current implementation cycles through `_PROP_EFFECT_POOL` in round-robin order per group.
- Future improvement: weight effect selection by section energy, mood, and tempo. High-energy
  sections should favor Meteors/Shockwave/Strobe; low-energy sections should favor
  Ripple/Spirals/Wave. The rotation seed should incorporate variation_seed so repeated
  sections get different effect assignments.
- Consider per-prop-type affinity: arches look best with Chase/Wave, mini-trees with
  Spirals/Fire, candy canes with Single Strand/Bars.

### Crash/Transient Detector for Whole-House Accent (01_BASE_All_FADES) — REDESIGNED 2026-07-16 (v3)
- **Shipped (current, v3 — crash-stem impact score)**: the full-mix treble
  detector below was replaced 2026-07-16 after bug-265/bug-266 showed it had
  never placed a single effect (stale-cache silent skip: `SCHEMA_VERSION`
  wasn't bumped when `crash_accents` was added; and the 10s min-gap inside
  `find_peaks` suppressed the true crash behind a stronger neighbor).
  v3: `detect_crash_accents(cymbals, cym_sr, full_mix, mix_sr)` scores
  envelope peaks on a **cymbal-isolated stem** — drumsep (`49469ca8.th`,
  auto-downloaded to `~/.xlight/models/drumsep/`) chained on the demucs
  drums stem via `src/analyzer/drum_stems.py::separate_cymbals()`, cached as
  `.stems/<md5>/drums_cymbals.mp3`. Score = log1p(isolation over the prior
  8s local background) x log1p(wash area / median ordinary-peak area), >=4kHz
  band, absolute floor 5.0, 3s min-gap post-scoring, cap 6, full-mix
  pre-transient RMS guard kept from v2. Validated on 6 user-confirmed Dream
  On crashes: 5/6 detected incl. both original ground-truth crashes (the 50.85s
  "accepted miss" below is now DETECTED; the 163.5s crash rides a tom fill that
  drumsep routes to toms/snare — the accepted miss of v3). No cymbals stem →
  zero marks (zero beats wrong). Hierarchy schema bumped to 2.1.0; readers
  now accept any 2.x (`src/analyzer/result.py::is_hierarchy_schema`).
  Marks also export as a `crash_accents` .xtiming layer (700ms fixed width).
  See `openspec/changes/crash-stem-impact-score/`.
- **Cap raised 6 → 12 (2026-08-04)**: the "6" cap was calibrated against a
  *truncated* ~202s cymbal stem cached under a different, older filename for
  the same song (`dream-on-official-hd-video---aerosmith.mp4`, not the real
  265.5s `Dream On--Aerosmith.mp4`) — so "6 confirmed crashes" was never the
  song's real count. Re-run against the correct full-length audio (demucs +
  drumsep, in-process, ~11 min on CPU): Dream On has **10** candidates
  clearing the unchanged 7.0 score floor, not 6 — the cap was silently
  dropping 4 real crashes (2:04.2, 2:22.4, 3:04.9, and a user-confirmed one
  at 4:12.5, score 7.77). The score floor was always the actual rarity gate;
  the cap is only a runaway-false-positive safety valve, so raising it to 12
  changes nothing for any song that scored under the old cap of 6. See
  `.wolf/buglog.json` for the investigation session.
- Historical write-up of v1/v2 below, kept for context.

### Crash/Transient Detector — v2 history (2026-07-14/15, superseded)
- **Shipped (superseded)**: `src/analyzer/crash_accents.py::detect_crash_accents()`
  runs librosa `onset_strength` on a **treble-band-only** (>=4000Hz) spectrogram
  of the full-mix audio, peak-picks genuine local maxima at least 10s apart
  (`scipy.signal.find_peaks`), and keeps only peaks that clear BOTH a 6x-over-
  median ratio floor AND a pre-transient RMS floor (the 500ms immediately
  before the peak must average >=40% of the song's median RMS). Hard-capped
  at 5 marks/song. Wired into `run_orchestrator` (Stage 8, right after
  `energy_impacts`/`drops`/`gaps`) and stored on `HierarchyResult.crash_accents`.
- **First version was wrong, caught by testing on the real target song**
  (Dream On/Aerosmith): a full-spectrum-onset + 95th-percentile/4x-ratio
  design (i) missed both known crashes (50.85s, ~190s — only 1.2-2.5x the
  song's level) and (ii) instead flagged the track's very first audio frame,
  which is the *quietest* half-second in the song (RMS ~0.05 vs track RMS
  ~0.22) but produces the single largest full-spectrum spectral-flux value in
  the track purely from transitioning out of near-silence. Two fixes:
  treble-band-only onset (a cymbal crash is specifically bright/high-frequency,
  unlike an ordinary loud low/mid-weighted hit, so this isolated the ~190s
  crash as a clear standout: 6.17x vs the next-loudest moment's 5.66x) and the
  pre-transient RMS floor (cleanly separates "crash within ongoing music" from
  "cold open out of silence": real crashes measured 77-95% of median pre-RMS,
  the false positive measured 1%).
- **50.85s is accepted as a miss.** Even after both fixes, it only measured
  ~3.5x locally and sits mid-pack among ~14 similarly-loud moments in the same
  song — no clean statistical gap separates "the one crash a listener noticed"
  from "an ordinary loud drum/guitar hit" at that strength. Per explicit user
  decision (2026-07-15, "ship for the clear case only"): tuned so only a
  single, dramatically-isolated treble transient qualifies; quieter crashes
  like this one are deliberately left undetected rather than loosening the
  floor and admitting several false positives elsewhere in the same song.
- Generator side: `effect_placer.py::_place_crash_accents()` places a ~700ms
  "Shockwave Full Fast" variant on `01_BASE_All_FADES` for each mark, skipping
  any mark within 500ms of a vocal word (`config.vocal_words`) or at/after the
  existing end-of-song fade's start boundary (computed via `_audible_end_ms`
  in `plan.py`, passed in as `fade_exclusion_start_ms`). Gated by
  `GenerationConfig.crash_accents` (default `True`). Tests:
  `tests/unit/test_crash_accents.py` (detector),
  `tests/unit/test_generator/test_crash_accents_placement.py` (placement).
- Below is the original design/investigation note, kept for context.
- User request (2026-07-14): identify audible "crash" moments (e.g. a cymbal
  hit) mid-song — not just at section boundaries — and place a Shockwave on
  `01_BASE_All_FADES` (a special override canvas that covers the whole
  layout, currently reserved for the end-of-song dimmer fade only).
- **Verified gap**: the existing `derive_energy_impacts` (`src/analyzer/derived.py`,
  1-second window, 1.8x ratio threshold, "validated on a 22-song batch") does
  NOT catch real, audible crashes. Checked against a real cached hierarchy
  (Dream On - Aerosmith, 201.9s): two known crash timestamps (50.85s, ~190s)
  both peak at only ~1.3x ratio using the exact same windowing algorithm —
  well under the 1.8x threshold. The 1-second window averages out what's
  likely a brief (sub-second) percussive transient; the existing detector is
  tuned for broader section-level energy jumps, not brief accent hits.
- **What's needed**: a genuinely new, separate short-window (~250-300ms)
  transient detector, distinct from `energy_impacts` (do not lower/change
  the existing validated threshold — that risks regressing whatever it's
  currently tuned for). Needs validation against more than one song's two
  known timestamps before shipping — two points from one song isn't enough
  to tune a threshold without overfitting. Revisit once more ground-truth
  crash timestamps (ideally from several different songs/genres) are
  available. Corroborating signals worth considering once WhisperX word
  timing is available for the song: a crash landing inside a gap between
  vocal words is a stronger signal than energy alone (observed, though not
  used per user instruction, in a third-party lyric-timing reference file
  for this same song).
- **User-stated design constraint (2026-07-14): these accents must be rare
  by design.** Most songs should get zero of them; a handful of the most
  extreme moments per song is the ceiling, not a per-section or per-beat
  thing. Tune for high precision over recall — better to miss a real crash
  than to fire on ordinary loud passages. This should shape the eventual
  threshold choice (aim conservative) and probably a hard per-song cap on
  how many can fire regardless of how many pass the ratio test.
- Placement mechanics note: `01_BASE_All_FADES` is currently a "reserved"
  single-placement canvas (`if g.name.endswith("_FADES"): continue` blocks
  all per-section theme/recipe placement in `effect_placer.py`; `plan.py`
  places exactly one end-of-song fade there). A crash-accent feature would
  need its own song-scoped placement pass (like `_place_singing_faces`/
  `_place_video_effect`), not routed through the per-section pipeline, and
  must not collide in time/layer with the existing end-of-song fade.

### Moving Head — Gated Wash with Effect-Setting Variety
- **Current state (2026-07-16)**: `src/generator/moving_head.py` only places
  effects at rare crash-accent marks (short fan-out Pan/Tilt punch + silent
  warmup, via `place_moving_head_crash_accents`). The v1 continuous
  per-section white wash (`place_moving_head_effects`) was removed the same
  day — it lit the DMX Moving Head group for the entire song regardless of
  energy/mood, which didn't read well once seen against real hardware. See
  the module's docstring for the removal rationale.
- **Deferred follow-up (explicit user decision, 2026-07-16)**: a wash should
  come back, but gated to specific conditions (e.g. only during high-energy
  sections/choruses/drops) rather than firing on every section
  unconditionally. Before rebuilding it, first come up with **a variety of
  effect settings to choose/rotate between** (different Pan/Tilt poses,
  dimmer levels, maybe motion patterns) instead of the single hard-coded
  full-white/full-dimmer/no-movement setting v1 used everywhere — a gated
  wash that still always looks identical would just be a smaller version of
  the same problem.
- `place_moving_head_crash_accents`'s `existing_placements` parameter already
  supports this: it's meant to receive whatever wash placements exist so the
  crash punch's warmup can skip inserting when the wash already covers that
  window (see `test_warmup_skipped_when_wash_already_covers_the_window` in
  `tests/unit/test_generator/test_moving_head_crash_accents.py`, still
  passing even with no wash currently produced) — wire a future gated-wash
  dict into `plan.py`'s `moving_head_effects` variable (currently hard-coded
  to `{}`) and pass it through the same call.

### Riff/Fill Detector — snare-roll burst on Star groups (2026-07-18, v2)
- **Current state: code present, gated OFF by default pending real-world
  listening.** `src/analyzer/riff_bursts.py::detect_riff_bursts(snare_audio,
  snare_sr)` and `effect_placer.py::_place_star_bursts` both exist and are
  unit tested; `GenerationConfig.riff_bursts` (`src/generator/models.py`)
  defaults to `False`.
- **v1 (bass+chord, retired same day)**: validated by hand against a
  sparser external onset computation than what actually shipped, and
  failed on real data — missed both of the user's original
  by-ear-confirmed moments and 0/9 confirmed on follow-up candidates. Its
  Moving Head placement also collided with the crash-accent warmup (which
  fills the entire gap between crash marks), silently blocking every
  candidate mark even when the signal itself was right.
- **v2 (this version) fixes both problems at once.** The user provided a
  real isolated snare stem for the validation song and pointed out an
  audible triple-hit around 33s — the actual physical signal a "riff" turns
  out to be is a **snare-drum roll/fill**, not a bass/chord phenomenon.
  `detect_riff_bursts` now finds runs of >=3 onsets on the snare stem with
  consecutive gaps <=0.2s, using `drum_stems.py::separate_snare` (the
  `redoblante` source from the same drumsep run `separate_cymbals` already
  does for crash accents — `drum_stems.py` was generalized to run
  inference once and cache every source, so pairing both costs no extra
  compute). Validated end-to-end against a full fresh analysis: found
  both original confirmations natively (no section-boundary special case
  needed) plus 5/5 spot-checked follow-ups confirmed by ear — a materially
  better hit rate than v1's 0/9. Placement targets `06_PROP_Star`-family
  groups (a real xLights Pinwheel preset the user supplied: 3 arms, twist
  148, red/yellow/orange palette, layered above the recipe's own content)
  instead of Moving Head, sidestepping the warmup collision entirely since
  Stars share no DMX channels with anything else.
- Detection is **not** rare-by-design like crash_accents — it fires
  roughly once every 12s on a song with frequent fills (17 marks on the
  197s validation song). Keeping the resulting accent visually distinct is
  the generator's job (placement cadence/effect choice), not the
  detector's.
- Schema bumped to 2.4.0 — v1's cached marks are wrong under v2's
  detector, not just a differently-shaped field, so caches must
  invalidate, not just gain a new key.
- Implementation note for future test fixtures on this detector or any
  other `librosa.onset.onset_detect`-based one: onset detection there is
  scale-invariant (fires on pure low-amplitude noise, not just real
  signal) — model "no activity" test fixtures as true silence
  (`np.zeros`), not quiet Gaussian noise. Full details in cerebrum.md.

### QM Segmenter Boundary Merging
- The `_merge_qm_boundaries` function uses a simple 2-second minimum gap to avoid
  micro-sections. A better approach would weight QM boundaries by the energy change
  across the boundary (from L5 energy curves) and only merge boundaries with significant
  energy transitions.

### Value Curves Integration
- Value curves (`generate_value_curves` in `src/generator/value_curves.py`) are currently
  disabled (Phase 1 comment in `build_plan`). These allow effect parameters to change
  over time within a single effect placement — e.g. speed ramps up toward a beat drop,
  brightness follows the energy curve, color mix shifts with chord changes.
- Priority parameters for value curves:
  - **Brightness**: follow L5 energy curve so effects breathe with the music
  - **Speed**: ramp up during builds, slow down during drops
  - **Color mix**: shift palette position to follow chord changes (L6 harmony)
  - **Effect-specific**: Fire height follows energy, Ripple movement follows beats
- xLights supports value curves via `VC_` prefixed parameters in the effect string.
  The `supports_value_curve` flag in `builtin_effects.json` marks which parameters
  can accept curves. See `src/generator/value_curves.py` for the existing framework.

### Prop Effect Suitability and Selection
- Currently all prop groups get effects from the same pool (`_PROP_EFFECT_POOL`) without
  considering what looks good on each prop type. This needs a suitability matrix:
  - **Arches/Candy Canes** (linear): Single Strand, Bars, Wave, Marquee work well.
    Shockwave/Ripple render poorly on 1D props.
  - **Matrices** (2D grids): Plasma, Butterfly, Fire, Pinwheel look great.
    Single Strand wastes the 2D resolution.
  - **Mini props** (stars, ornaments, low pixel): On/Off, Strobe, Twinkle are most
    effective. Complex effects are wasted on <50 pixel props.
  - **Deer/figures** (custom shapes): Shimmer, Color Wash, Twinkle preserve the shape.
    Directional effects (Bars, Wave) ignore the form factor.
- Implementation: add a `suitability` dict to each effect in `builtin_effects.json`
  mapping prop display types (SingleLine, Custom, Matrix, Tree, etc.) to a 0-1 score.
  Use these scores in `_build_effect_pool` to weight selection per group based on the
  dominant prop type in that group.
- Also consider prop pixel count: high-density props can handle complex effects,
  low-density props should get simpler ones.

### End-of-Song Fade Out
- Songs that end with a gradual energy decrease (detected via L5 energy curves
  and _drop tagged sections) should have a smooth visual fade-out rather than
  an abrupt cut. Implementation options:
  - Apply a brightness value curve that ramps from 100% to 0% over the final
    _drop section on all active tiers
  - Progressively kill upper tiers one by one (heroes first, then compounds,
    then props, then beats) as energy decreases, leaving only the dim background
    wash for the final seconds
  - Use the existing fade_out_ms field on EffectPlacement to add crossfade
    on the last effect in each group
- This ties into the value curves integration above — a brightness ramp on
  the final section would be the simplest and most effective approach.

### 3D Effects, Blending, and Multi-Layer Effects
- Current implementation places one effect per layer per group. xLights supports
  stacking multiple effect layers on a single model/group with blend modes
  (Additive, Subtractive, Mask, etc.) to create composite visuals.
- **Layer stacking**: place the base effect on layer 1, then add an accent effect
  on layer 2 with a blend mode. E.g. Color Wash (layer 1) + Twinkle (layer 2,
  Additive) creates a twinkling wash. The theme already defines multi-layer
  setups — this would render them as actual stacked layers in the XSQ instead
  of mapping them to different tier groups.
- **3D model awareness**: props with WorldPosZ (depth) or 3D model types could
  use depth-based effects — front props brighter than back props, or effects
  that sweep in the Z direction. The layout parser already reads WorldPosZ.
- **Buffer transforms**: xLights supports per-layer transforms (rotation, zoom,
  blur) via B_SLIDER parameters. Subtle rotation on Pinwheel or zoom pulses
  on Shockwave timed to beats would add visual depth.
- **Render style options**: beyond Per Model Default, explore Per Model Per Preview
  and Per Model Single Line for different prop types.

### Section Transition Boundary Cleanup
- Some section boundaries from the segmentino + QM merge produce awkward
  transitions where effects cut abruptly or overlap in unexpected ways.
  Issues to investigate:
  - **Snap precision**: `_snap_sections_to_bars` uses a window of half the
    median bar interval. Some boundaries may snap to the wrong bar, creating
    short (<2s) or overlapping sub-sections.
  - **Effect crossfade at boundaries**: currently effects end exactly at the
    section boundary and the next section's effects start immediately. Adding
    a short crossfade (fade_out_ms on the outgoing effect, fade_in_ms on the
    incoming) would smooth transitions.
  - **Theme change at boundaries**: when a section changes themes (e.g. A→N5),
    the color palette and effect type change instantly. A 500ms blend or brief
    "Off" gap between sections would create cleaner visual transitions.
  - **QM merge edge cases**: QM boundaries very close to bar lines may create
    sub-sections that are too short to render a full effect cycle. The current
    min_gap_ms=5000 may need tuning per song tempo.
  - Test with more songs to identify systematic boundary issues vs one-offs.

### Custom Per-Song Themes
- Allow users to create custom themes tailored to specific songs, beyond the
  21 built-in themes. Implementation:
  - Custom theme JSON files in `~/.xlight/custom_themes/*.json` (the theme
    library loader already supports this path from feature 019)
  - A `--theme` CLI flag on `generate` to force a specific theme for all sections
  - A `--theme-file` flag to load a one-off theme JSON for a song
  - Theme wizard: interactive prompts to build a theme by choosing mood, palette
    colors, accent colors, base effect, upper effects, and blend modes
  - Theme preview: render a 10-second sample of each section with the chosen
    theme so users can evaluate before committing to a full sequence
  - Song-theme mapping: a config file that remembers which custom theme to use
    for each song (keyed by audio hash or filename)

### Explore Advanced Visual Effects
- Investigate underused xLights effects that could add visual interest:
  - **Kaleidoscope**: mirrors and rotates the underlying effect to create
    symmetrical patterns. Works as a modifier layer (blend on top of a base
    effect). Could be powerful on matrices and large groups where symmetry
    reads well.
  - **Warp**: distorts the effect buffer with swirl/ripple/dissolve transforms.
    Combined with a base like Color Wash or Plasma, could create organic
    evolving visuals. Currently only used in Molten Metal (removed).
  - **Spirograph**: mathematical curve patterns that animate over time.
    Visually striking on matrices but untested in our pipeline.
  - **Galaxy / Swirl patterns**: using Pinwheel with high twist + Kaleidoscope
    overlay could simulate galaxy/vortex effects for dramatic moments.
  - **Music-reactive modifiers**: Kaleidoscope size or Warp intensity driven
    by beat energy or spectral flux, so the visual distortion pulses with
    the music.
- These are best used sparingly as accent effects on hero props or during
  high-energy impact sections rather than as base layer backgrounds.
- Test each on different prop types (1D strings, 2D matrices, custom shapes)
  to determine suitability before adding to the effect pool.

## Design-First Gate

Before writing or editing project code for any change that does **not** qualify as
trivial (criteria below), you must produce a written design and receive explicit
user approval. This exists because jumping to implementation too fast has produced
silent regressions in shared modules and shallow designs that missed obvious edges.

### Trivial-path carve-out

A change qualifies as trivial — and may skip the full design phase — only when
**all** of the following are true:

1. Modifies exactly one file.
2. Fewer than ~30 lines changed (added + removed combined).
3. You can state the root cause in one sentence: *"X happens because Y."*
4. Does NOT modify any public API signature, CLI command or flag, JSON/XML schema
   field, or any file under the shared modules listed below.

If any condition fails, the full gate applies.

### Shared modules (always require the full gate)

These modules are each imported by 32+ files outside themselves. A 10-line change
inside them can silently break many downstream callers, so size is not a safe
proxy for risk. Any change — regardless of line count — requires a design:

- `src/analyzer/`
- `src/effects/`
- `src/generator/`
- `src/review/`
- `src/themes/`

### Required contents of the design artifact

The design may be an OpenSpec change directory (`openspec/changes/<name>/` with
`proposal.md` + `design.html`) or an inline plan in the conversation. The
`design.html` is the rich human-review artifact and links the shared stylesheet
at `openspec/changes/_design.css` via `<link rel="stylesheet" href="../_design.css">`
— do not re-inline CSS. Reference example:
`openspec/changes/tier-layering-policy/design.html`. `proposal.md`, `tasks.md`,
and any `specs/` deltas remain markdown because they are read by OpenSpec
tooling and by the `openspec-apply-change` skill. Either form must cover:

- **Goal** — one sentence of what problem this solves.
- **Approach** — the chosen solution, with at least one **alternative considered**
  and a one-sentence rationale for rejecting it.
- **Files touched** — specific paths, with whether each is added/modified/removed.
- **Regression surface** — for every modified public symbol (module-level function,
  class method, CLI flag, schema field), list the callers found via grep across
  `src/` and `tests/`. State which are updated and which should be untouched.
- **Historical echoes** — scan `.wolf/buglog.json` and `.wolf/cerebrum.md`
  Do-Not-Repeat for entries matching the change's files, symbols, or topic.
  Reference matching bug IDs and summarize their fixes. No matches found should
  be stated explicitly, not omitted.

After producing the design, pause and wait for the user to approve before editing
any project file. Do not auto-proceed.

### Stress-testing the design

Use the `/pre-mortem` slash command (or the `pre-mortem` skill directly) to run
an adversarial pass over a design before implementation. The skill produces a
structured report: Regression surface, Hidden assumptions, Historical echoes,
Alternatives not considered, Test gap, and a Verdict. Use it when a design
touches shared modules, is architecturally ambiguous, or feels risky.

The pre-mortem is complementary to `/review-diff` and `/ultrareview`: pre-mortem
reviews the **plan** (pre-code); the others review the **diff** (post-code).
Running both at their respective stages is the recommended path for non-trivial
changes.

### Pre-merge acceptance gate

Before opening a pull request for any non-trivial change, run the acceptance
gate locally:

```bash
xlight-evaluate gate            # full gate (analyzer + generator + UI)  ~3-5 min
xlight-evaluate gate --quick    # quick mode: 1 fixture + content UI flow only
xlight-evaluate gate --skip-ui  # skip UI suite (e.g. when Playwright not installed)
```

CI runs the **cheap tier** automatically on every PR (unit tests, generator
quality check, UI smoke flows). The **expensive tier** (full analyzer pipeline
on the CC0 corpus, content-validating UI flow with real analysis) requires
the `.venv-vamp` sidecar with madmom/vamp installed and is intentionally
**not** run in CI — install complexity + runtime cost outweigh the benefit
on a fresh runner. Developers exercise that locally before opening a PR.

Exit codes from the gate, in priority order:

- `0` — all suites pass
- `6` — at least one suite detected a regression
- `4` — no baseline exists for one or more suites (run `xlight-evaluate
        snapshot-analyzer` first)
- `8` — infrastructure failure (Playwright missing, corpus download
        failed, etc.)

Adding a file to CI's `--ignore` list (in `.github/workflows/evaluate.yml`)
requires a paired entry in `docs/known-broken-tests.md` with diagnosis and
remediation plan. **No silent quarantine** — quarantined tests rot, and a
quarantine ratchet without a paired doc entry erodes the gate over time.

### Visual-quality microscope

The `microscope` subcommand group measures the visual quality of generated
sequences against a panel of CC0 fixtures. It is a developer tool, not part
of CI — run it locally when changing effect selection, palette, pacing, or
prop-pairing logic.

```bash
# Per-song run (writes microscope-out/microscope/<slug>/metrics.json)
xlight-evaluate microscope run path/to/song.mp3

# Whole panel (4 fixtures: funshine, maple_leaf_rag, nostalgic_piano,
# space_ambience) with optional --baseline diff
xlight-evaluate microscope panel --baseline tests/golden/microscope/

# Matrix-heavy panel — same 4 fixtures on a layout that auto-promotes two
# corner-positioned matrix props to HERO tier so the matrix-prop code path
# actually receives placements. Use when changing matrix-related logic.
xlight-evaluate microscope panel \
  --manifest tests/fixtures/reference/panel_manifest_matrix.json \
  --baseline tests/golden/microscope/matrix/

# Sensitivity gate — must pass before promoting any baseline. Writes
# tests/golden/microscope/sensitivity_passed.json on success.
xlight-evaluate microscope sensitivity

# Promote per-song metrics.json into tests/golden/microscope/<slug>/baseline.json.
# Refuses to run unless the sensitivity proof file exists and is at least as
# recent as the most-recent commit touching src/evaluation/metrics/,
# src/evaluation/xsq_reader.py, or src/effects/builtin_effects.json.
xlight-evaluate microscope baseline

# Tier-coverage verification. Reads each fixture's metrics.json from a
# previous `microscope panel` run and asserts the observed active_tiers
# cover the manifest's declared tier_intent, plus that the required-tier
# set (01_BASE, 02_GEO, 04_BEAT, 06_PROP, 08_HERO) is fully declared
# across the panel. Exit 0 pass, 6 coverage regression, 2 manifest/output-dir error.
xlight-evaluate microscope verify-coverage \
  --manifest tests/fixtures/reference/panel_manifest.json \
  --output-dir microscope-out/
```

When the metric registry changes (new metric, removed metric, definition
updated), the sensitivity proof's `metric_set_hash` no longer matches the
current registry — re-run `microscope sensitivity` before any
`microscope baseline`.

### Explicit override

If the user explicitly says "just do it," "skip the design," or similar, comply
and proceed directly to implementation. Note the skipped gate in the
end-of-session summary so the override is visible for future reference. The gate
is a default, not a wall.

## Engineering Principles

- **Favor real solutions over hacks.** Fix root causes, not symptoms. No `# HACK`,
  no `# TODO: fix this properly later`, no "temporary" workarounds that become permanent.
  If the right fix is too large for the current scope, say so — don't ship a band-aid.
- **Understand before changing.** Read the relevant code before proposing modifications.
  Trace the call chain. Check how existing callers use the function. Don't guess at behavior.
- **Don't over-engineer.** Solve the problem at hand. No speculative abstractions,
  premature generalization, or "just in case" parameters. Three similar lines are
  better than a clever helper used once.
- **Don't under-engineer either.** If the task requires proper error handling, tests,
  or data validation — do it. Cutting corners to save time creates debt that costs more later.
- **Keep changes minimal and focused.** A bug fix is a bug fix — don't refactor
  surrounding code, add type hints to untouched functions, or "improve" unrelated logic.
- **Test what matters.** Write tests for non-trivial logic, edge cases, and regressions.
  Don't write tests that just assert the implementation does what the implementation does.
- **Name things clearly.** Variable and function names should convey intent. If you need
  a comment to explain what a name means, the name is wrong.
- **No dead code.** Don't comment out code "for reference." Don't leave unused imports,
  variables, or functions. Git history exists for a reason.
- **Don't quarantine instead of fixing.** `pytest.mark.xfail`, `pytest.mark.skip`,
  and CI `--ignore` flags are forms of "temporary workaround that becomes permanent."
  When a test fails, fix the test or fix the code — don't paper over it. The only
  acceptable quarantine is one accompanied by a `docs/known-broken-tests.md` entry
  with diagnosis, remediation plan, and an explicit reason it can't be fixed now.

## Test Isolation Conventions

Recurring test-isolation traps in this repo, with the patterns that fix them:

- **Patch the consumer's import path, not the canonical module.** Some symbols
  are re-exported (`src.cli` re-exports from `src.cli_old`); patching the
  re-export does NOT affect callers that import the original. Find where the
  symbol is *read* (`_get_variant_lib()` reads `src.cli_old._variant_library_override`)
  and patch there. `monkeypatch.setattr(src.cli_old, "_variant_library_override", lib)`,
  not `src.cli`.
- **Reset module-level state between tests.** Modules that hold dicts or
  singletons at module scope (`_runs`, `_jobs`, `_library` in
  `src/review/api/v1/analysis.py` and `src/review/variant_routes.py`)
  accumulate across tests. Fixtures must clear them explicitly:
  `with _analysis_module._runs_lock: _analysis_module._runs.clear()`.
- **Don't read the developer's filesystem.** Tests that load variants/themes
  must override `custom_dir` to a `tmp_path` so they don't pick up
  `~/.xlight/custom_variants/` from the dev host. Tests that resolve show
  paths must `monkeypatch.setattr("src.paths.get_show_dir", ...)` rather
  than relying on `~/xLights/` existing.
- **`XLIGHT_STATE_HOME` for state-dir isolation.** The `app` fixture in
  `tests/review/conftest.py` sets `XLIGHT_STATE_HOME=tmp_path` so the
  library, settings, and stems caches are scoped to the test.
