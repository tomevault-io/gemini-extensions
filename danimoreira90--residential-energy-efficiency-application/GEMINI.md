# Residential Energy Efficiency Application — AGENTS.md

**Generic agent rules for any AI coding assistant working on this repo.**
**Version:** 1.0 | **Date:** 2026-05-10

> This file is for agents that don't read `CLAUDE.md` (Claude Code only).
> Convention emerging across Aider, Codex, Continue, Sourcegraph Cody, Cursor.
> Keeps the project agent-portable.

## Identity

The Residential Energy Efficiency Application is a Brazilian-first chatbot that helps residential customers understand their `conta de luz`, identify habit-based savings, and evaluate whether installing solar panels would pay back at their location and consumption profile. v1 is Streamlit-only with Claude (Anthropic API) as the conversation engine; every quantitative claim the chatbot makes is grounded in a typed Python tool call.

Owner: Daniel Moreira. Repo: github.com/danimoreira90/Residential-Energy-Efficiency-Application.

## Hard Rules — non-negotiable

**HR-1 — Manual commits only.**
The owner Daniel is the only one allowed to run `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`, or any GitHub PR/merge command. Agents may show staged diffs and suggest commit messages as plain text only.

**HR-2 — v1 scope is locked.**
Build only what v1 asks for. The following are explicitly **out of scope** for v1 and must not be scaffolded, designed for, or partially implemented:

- WhatsApp delivery channel (any provider — Meta Business API, Twilio, Z-API, 360Dialog).
- Live inverter integration (Growatt cloud API, SolarEdge, Enphase, Modbus TCP, anything that talks to physical hardware).
- NILM / energy disaggregation (`nilmtk` and friends).
- Smart-home control or load shifting automation.
- Multi-tenant authentication or RBAC. v1 is single-user keyed off a Streamlit session.
- Commercial / industrial customers (Group A tariffs). v1 targets Brazilian residential Group B (B1).

If a feature request implies any of the above, an agent must stop, flag it as out-of-scope per HR-2, and wait for Daniel.

**HR-3 — Applied schema migrations are immutable.**
The DuckDB schema is versioned with timestamped SQL files in `migrations/`. Any migration with a timestamp ≤ today MUST NOT be edited. New behavior = new migration with new timestamp.

**HR-4 — Test integrity.**
- CREATE new test files: permitted (TDD red-green-refactor encouraged).
- EDIT existing test files: forbidden without explicit Daniel approval + tech-debt log entry.
- DELETE existing tests: forbidden.
- Soften assertions, add `@pytest.mark.skip`, `pytest.xfail`, or `@pytest.mark.skipif(True, ...)` to existing tests: forbidden.
- Mock the world to make a test pass: forbidden. Mock external services (Anthropic API, ANEEL, NASA POWER); never mock the function under test.

**HR-5 — LLM quantitative discipline.**
The chatbot must never invent numbers. Every quantitative claim in a chatbot response must originate from a tool call. Concretely, agents implementing chatbot features MUST:

- Register each capability as a typed tool via `energia.chat.tools.registry` (see `KICKOFF.md`).
- Place all numeric computation inside the tool function — never in the system prompt or in free-text post-processing.
- Include the rule "Você nunca inventa números — toda afirmação quantitativa vem de uma chamada de ferramenta" in the system prompt and never weaken it.
- Log every tool call and its result, so we can audit the chain `user message → tool call → result → narration`.

**HR-6 — LGPD discipline on bill data.**
Brazilian energy bills contain personal data (CPF/CNPJ, full address, installation number). Agents implementing bill ingestion MUST:

- Never log bill PDFs, photos, or extracted CPF/CNPJ to stdout, files, or external services.
- Never embed user identifiers in Anthropic API request metadata.
- Store bill data only in the local DuckDB at `data/energia.duckdb` (gitignored).
- When in doubt about whether a piece of data is PII, treat it as PII.

## Disciplines

This project applies:

**TDD** — Test-Driven Development. Failing test before production code. Red → Green → Refactor. Standard across all non-LLM code.

**EDD** — Eval-Driven Development. For every chatbot capability (each registered tool), a capability eval suite runs before merge. Capability pass@3 ≥ 0.90 to ship; regression pass^3 = 1.00 to ship. Evals live under `evals/` as JSONL fixtures + a runner.

**SDD** — Spec-Driven Development. Non-trivial features get a SPEC.md before PLAN.md before code. Spec answers "what" and "why"; plan answers "in what order"; code is the last step.

**Anti-Cheat** — Never fake a passing state. Show real test output. Don't soften, skip, or mock the function under test. See `docs/agentic-engineering/ANTI-CHEAT.md` for the full taxonomy and grep patterns.

---

## Branch Roles

Use these prefixes when creating branches:

- `feature/<name>` — new chatbot capability, new Streamlit page, new module
- `data/<name>` — new external data source (ANEEL, NASA POWER, distributor adapter, bill format)
- `quality/<name>` — tests, evals, docs, ADRs
- `infra/<name>` — CI/CD, deploy, secrets, observability
- `bugfix/issue-<n>-<name>` — pointed fix referencing a GitHub issue
- `chore/<name>` — dependency bumps, config tweaks, refactor without behavior change

Detail: `docs/agentic-engineering/ROLES.md` (to be created in Sprint 1).

## Protected Paths

Read-only without owner approval:
```
migrations/2026*.sql                # Applied to local DuckDB (HR-3)
docs/adr/0*.md                      # Approved ADRs are immutable
.github/                            # CI configs
.gitattributes
tests/**/*.py                       # Editing forbidden (HR-4); creation permitted
evals/**/*.jsonl                    # Eval fixtures are append-only baselines
src/energia/chat/prompts.py         # System prompt — touch only via SPEC + Daniel
```

Editable with diff review:
```
pyproject.toml                      # New deps require ADR
uv.lock                             # Regenerated by uv, must match pyproject.toml
ruff.toml / pyrightconfig.json
.gitignore
```

Free to edit by agent (within role scope):
```
src/energia/**/*.py (NOT chat/prompts.py, NOT in tests/)
docs/sessions/**, docs/specs/**, docs/decisions/**
notebooks/**                         # Scratch space, not production
```

Detail: `docs/agentic-engineering/PROTECTED-PATHS.md`.

## Reporting

When you finish work and want approval to commit:

1. Show `git diff --cached` (full output, not summary).
2. Show test command and FULL terminal output (no paraphrasing).
3. Show coverage report output if relevant.
4. For chatbot features: show eval runner output (capability pass@3, regression pass^3).
5. List which Protected Paths you touched, if any.
6. Wait for Daniel to commit.

If a test fails: do NOT skip it, soften it, or mock around it. Stop, report, propose a fix to PRODUCTION CODE, and wait for instruction.

---

## When Uncertain

Stop. Report the uncertainty. List 2-3 options with trade-offs. Wait for Daniel to decide.

Trial-and-error in production code is forbidden. "Let me try X and if it fails I'll try Y" is not a valid plan.
