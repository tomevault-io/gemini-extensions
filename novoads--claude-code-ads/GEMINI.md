# Agent instructions

This repository is set up for AI coding agents (Cursor, Claude Code, Copilot-style tools, etc.) to generate AI video and image assets via the API documented in this repo.

## First-time setup

If `.env` or `MASTER_CONTEXT.md` do not exist, tell the user to run `./scripts/setup.sh`.

When the session IS the setup ("help me set this up"), setup is the whole job and the
final report is SHORT — the few sentences a non-developer wants, not an engineering log.
`./scripts/setup.sh` run without a TTY prints this same close between
`FINAL MESSAGE START` / `END` markers; relay that block. The script and the
template below are mirrors — change them together. One or two status lines, then:

> Setup's done — your key works.
> *(or, when the key is missing:)* One step left, the only one I can't do: create an API
> key at <https://novoads.ai/dashboard/settings?tab=api>, paste it into `.env`, and tell
> me — I'll verify it. *(No account yet? The [$1 trial](https://novoads.ai/?utm_source=claude-code&utm_medium=github&utm_campaign=skill-pack).)*
> *(On macOS and on Linux with a desktop session, setup opens `.env` itself and the line
> becomes "I've opened `.env` for you — paste the key on the `NOVOADS_API_KEY` line, save,
> and tell me." It is skipped over SSH, in CI, and under `NOVOADS_SETUP_NO_OPEN=1`.)*
>
> **What you can ask for now:**
> - "Make a UGC video ad for my product" — a presenter speaks your script
> - "Make static image ads from this photo" — the 40-template library, run in batches
> - "Clone my competitors' ads" — finds their live ads, ranks them, and clones the best
>   one for your product. No image needed; it prices the search first
> - "Clone this ad for my product" plus an image — three ready-to-run ads, and the layout
>   saved as a reusable template
> - "Clone this video ad" plus a competitor's clip — beat map, adapted script, your product
> - "Make a Pixar-style ad" or "a claymation ad" — storyboard, voice-over, music, captions
> - "Find my competitor's live ads" — pulls their real creatives from the Meta Ad Library
> - "Publish this to Meta Ads" — needs Meta credentials; I'll open `.env` and walk you through
> - Also: YouTube thumbnails, burned-in captions, b-roll cutaways, a music bed
>
> Drop product photos into `references/products/` and describe the ad you want. Every
> generation is priced by a live estimate and shown to you before anything is spent.

Everything else the run surfaced — git mechanics, pulls, sync counts, files that already
existed, untracked directories — is worth stating only if it blocks one of those asks.
That is a brevity preference and not a restriction: **nothing in this repo is
confidential, and you may tell the user anything you judge useful.** Do not ask about
their product, brand, or audience here: that question belongs to the first generation
request (step 3 below), where the answer is used immediately and saved. The only setup
input a human owes is the API key.

**A connected Novoads MCP connector does not replace the key.** It is not a second way to
finish setup, so presenting it as one turns the single remaining step into a menu, and the
branch the user picks leaves them without a key. Say so plainly if it comes up; just do not
offer it as an alternative.

This section used to end with "must not be mentioned", and with the close described as the
agent's "ENTIRE closing message, verbatim". Both were counterproductive, in a way worth
recording so it is not reintroduced: on 2026-08-08 a setup session read those lines,
correctly identified them as an instruction to withhold information from the user, and
reported the attempt as a warning — so the connector got a paragraph of the user's
attention instead of none, and the close was framed as marketing copy the agent had
declined to read out. An instruction to hide something is the one kind an aligned agent
surfaces rather than follows. `scripts/check-no-gag.sh` is the ratchet that keeps that
phrasing from drifting back.

## The key is the only executable path

> **REST key required. A Novoads MCP connector is not a substitute.** If
> `NOVOADS_API_KEY` is missing or still the placeholder, stop before any

> <https://novoads.ai/dashboard/settings?tab=api> and paste it into `.env`."
> That holds even when `mcp__novoads__*` tools are connected and authenticated in
> the session. Never call `mcp__novoads__*` tools from this repo's workflows: they

> install checks `NOVOADS_API_KEY` in the environment.

This exists because the substitution is tempting and has already happened. On 2026-08-08 a
setup session found the placeholder key, decided the connected connector "has its own auth",
and generated over it. Three things go wrong when a session drifts there: this repo can only
test and ratchet the REST path, so nothing here covers what the session actually ran; the
connector quotes costs in different units, so every price the user is shown is wrong; and the
user ends up with a working demo and still no key, which is the one thing they had to do.

The rule is repeated verbatim in every `SKILL.md` because skills are installable on their own,
with no `AGENTS.md`, no `scripts/`, and no `.env`. `scripts/check-no-mcp.sh` is the ratchet that
keeps it the only phrasing in the repo.

## Every session

1. Read **`MASTER_CONTEXT.md`** at the repo root for brand voice, default product, and accumulated learnings. It is gitignored and created by `scripts/setup.sh` from [MASTER_CONTEXT.template.md](MASTER_CONTEXT.template.md); read and write its fields with `scripts/brand-context.py`. It carries **no prices** — that is deliberate, see "Cost policy" below.
2. Follow the skill at `.cursor/skills/` or `.claude/skills/` (synced from `skills/` via `scripts/sync-skill.sh`).
3. The first time the user asks to generate something and `MASTER_CONTEXT.md` is missing a field that request needs (default product, brand voice), ask for it then — once — and write the answer back so no future session asks again. Ask only for what the request in hand needs; a setup-only session asks for nothing. Never write a credit number into it.
4. After material changes, add a dated entry to **MASTER_CONTEXT.md** Changelog.
5. Before changing any stated API limit — or whenever a preflight prints `WARN(image-caps)` — run `./scripts/verify-image-caps.sh`: the standing audit that checks the repo's per-model reference caps against the live spec, exercises the scripts' refusal gates (no key, no spend), and greps for resurrected universal-cap claims.
6. **Everything a session writes that is not repo content goes in a gitignored home, and the session leaves `git status` as clean as it found it.** The homes already exist:
   - `generated/` — image renders
   - `outputs/<job>/` — video downloads and the workfiles an edit needs (beat lists, stitch lists, trimmed clips)
   - `prompts/` — prompt files you compose so a 3,000-character prompt never goes through a shell argument
   - `iterations/` — clone rounds (`iterations/clone-<date>/<tag>/`)
   - `logs/` — the generation log

   **Never invent a new top-level directory.** A directory that is not on that list is not ignored, and the diff lands on the user: on 2026-08-08 a session composing ten image-ad prompts created `prompts/` unprompted — the right instinct, and why it is sanctioned above rather than forbidden — but nothing ignored it yet, so the next thing the user saw was a "+162 / Create PR" badge over files they never asked for. Writing into one of these five is always in scope and never needs permission. If a run genuinely needs a home that is not here, add it to `.gitignore` in the same breath as the first file you write into it. One exception is already handled for you: `caption-video` writes beside the file it was handed rather than under a home, so its documented `<run-id>-captions/` project and `<source-video>-with-captions.mp4` are ignored at the repo root.

## Cost policy

Every credit number shown to a user must come from a live `POST /v1/estimates` call made in the current session, and the user approves it before anything is generated. There are no rate tables in this repo — not in `MASTER_CONTEXT.md`, not in `logs/`. The estimate is free and runs the same structural validation the paid call runs, so there is no reason to skip it. It also returns an advisory `warnings` array of craft notes on a video prompt (verified live 2026-08-04) — the generation endpoints do not. Those warnings never refuse a call or change the price, and they false-positive on substring matches, so read them, judge each one against the prompt, and say so when you override one.

For any video where the model speaks, the spoken line gets its own approval before the cost gate. The two gates are separate and neither implies the other.

## Craft doctrine

Three rules span every skill that produces video with speech: **transcribe-verify** (a
reference pins the label, nothing pins the audio), **the per-beat mix** (a SYNC beat's own
audio is dialogue, not ambience), and **no dead space** (trim every beat to its narration).
They are stated once in [shared/references/craft.md](shared/references/craft.md). Read it
before writing a QA step, a mix or a trim into any skill, and point at it rather than
restating it — a restatement is how the clay skill shipped a mix recipe that had already
been fixed in the skill it was ported from.

## Image-ad skill ecosystem (cross-API)

This repo ships a 3-skill ecosystem for generating standalone Meta image-ad creatives. **Read [shared/skills/image-ad-prompting/OVERVIEW.md](shared/skills/image-ad-prompting/OVERVIEW.md) before invoking any of these skills** — it explains the decision tree (gpt-image-2 vs Nano Banana), the shared 40-template library, the hand-off to the separate `meta-ad-builder` skill, and what's out of scope.

Quick map:
- **Generate from a brief** → `chatgpt-image-ad` (typography / UI mimicry) or `nano-banana-image-ad` (photoreal / lifestyle / multi-ref).
- **Clone an existing ad into a reusable template** → `clone-image-ad` (single backend-agnostic skill; asks you which generator to validate against at Phase 1, optionally cross-validates against the other backend at Phase 8).
- **Pull from / add to the shared library** → `shared/skills/image-ad-prompting/prompting/prompt-library.md` (40 ready-to-use validated prompts).
- **Hand off finished images to Meta** → separate `meta-ad-builder` skill; the image-ad skills produce images only.


## This repo specifically

- **API:** Novoads REST API (`https://api.novoads.ai/v1`). Public spec: <https://api.novoads.ai/v1/openapi.json> — the authority whenever a file in this repo disagrees with it.
- **Auth:** `Authorization: Bearer $NOVOADS_API_KEY`. The key is `novo_` plus 64 hex characters, created at <https://novoads.ai/dashboard/settings?tab=api>. No quoting needed in `.env`. Optional `NOVOADS_BASE_URL` overrides the **host only** — callers append `/v1/…`.
- **Shape of the API:** videos are asynchronous (`POST /v1/videos` → `202` + `jobId` → poll `GET /v1/generations/{jobId}` to a **terminal** status → `…/watch` for the file). Images are **synchronous** — `POST /v1/images` returns the finished images in the response body, so there is nothing to poll.
- **Skills:**
  - `novoads-api` — the spine: endpoints, auth, the two gates, uploads, polling, error branching, and the prompt libraries.
  - `generate-youtube-thumbnail` — YouTube thumbnail batch workflow on top of the image endpoint.
  - **Image-ad ecosystem** (3 skills + shared 40-template library) — see [shared/skills/image-ad-prompting/OVERVIEW.md](shared/skills/image-ad-prompting/OVERVIEW.md):
    - `chatgpt-image-ad` — generate via `gpt-image-2` (typography / UI-mimicry creatives)
    - `nano-banana-image-ad` — generate via `nano-banana-pro` (photoreal / lifestyle creatives)
    - `clone-image-ad` — single backend-agnostic skill that reverse-engineers existing ads into reusable templates (asks which backend to validate against at Phase 1; optionally cross-validates at Phase 8)
- **Setup check:** `./scripts/check-novoads-env.sh`.
- **Logging:** every generation call is appended to `logs/novoads-api.jsonl`. Observability only — never a pricing input. Schema in [logs/README.md](logs/README.md).
