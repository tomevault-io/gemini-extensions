## System Architecture

TSUKUYOMI is an intelligent modular framework for structured analysis and processing, designed for professional intelligence operations. The architecture follows a component-based design with three main layers:

### Core Components
- **tsukuyomi_core.tsukuyomi**: Central orchestration system managing module loading, execution, and workflow transitions
- **key.activationkey**: Framework initialization instructions defining file interpretation rules and activation sequences
- **personality/amaterasu_personalitycore.tsukuyomi**: Communication and interaction management system with stakeholder optimization
- **modules/**: Directory containing specialized operational modules (*.tsukuyomi files)

### File Format
All framework components use `.tsukuyomi` extension containing JSON-like structures. These files are:
- Text files with JSON syntax and custom schema
- Modular prompt engineering components
- Self-contained but interoperable modules
- Processed sequentially during activation

### Framework Operation
The system follows a specific initialization sequence:
1. Load and parse tsukuyomi_core.tsukuyomi
2. Extract configuration parameters (module_path, personality_path)
3. Load AMATERASU personality core
4. Initialize core functions and context management
5. Present greeting and await user input or module selection

## Module System

### Module Types
- **Core Intelligence Modules**: Data recognition, correlation analysis, discipline alignment
- **Economic Analysis (E-Series)**: E1-E4 modules for economic vulnerability and trade analysis
- **Strategic Analysis (S-Series)**: S1-S4 modules for geopolitical scenario modeling and capability assessment
- **Infrastructure & Security**: Critical infrastructure vulnerability and dependency mapping
- **Specialized Operations**: Flight data analysis, OSINT collection, comprehensive reporting
- **Source Quality & Bias Analysis**: Source correlation matrix, bias detection, AI hallucination detection
- **Session Management**: Session export/import modules for analytical continuity

### Module Architecture
Each module contains:
- Standard schema with id, version, title, type, dependencies
- Input requirements and output schema definitions
- Execution sequences with specific actions and conditions
- Error handling and security protocols
- IC-compliant analytical frameworks

## Communication Protocols

The framework uses standardized message prefixes:
- `//AMATERASU:` - System communications
- `//TSUKUYOMI:` - Framework operations  
- `//RESULT:` - Analytical findings
- `//QUERY:` - Clarification requests
- `//ANOMALY:` - Unusual patterns
- `//CRITICAL:` - Urgent information
- `//CLASSIFICATION:` - Security markings
- `//SELECTION:` - Menu option selections

## Framework Activation

### Splash Screen Interface

TSUKUYOMI includes an interactive splash screen that displays upon initialization (when `enable_splash_screen: true` in core configuration). The splash screen presents a compact menu with checkbox-style options (☐) for different operational modes:

1. Standard Analysis Mode - General analytical operations
2. Intelligence Operations Mode - Professional intelligence ops with security
3. Economic Analysis Suite - Economic vulnerability & trade analysis
4. Strategic Analysis Suite - Scenario modeling & capability assessment  
5. Infrastructure & Security Analysis - Critical infrastructure assessment
6. Specialized Operations - OSINT, flight data, custom reporting
6a. Source Quality & Bias Analysis - Source correlation matrix & bias detection
7. Module Browser - View all available modules
8. System Configuration - Configure security & operational parameters
9. Session Management - Export/import session snapshots for continuity

### Activation Methods

**Interactive Menu (with splash screen enabled):**
```
Initialise Amaterasu
```
System responds with menu and: `//AMATERASU: Welcome to TSUKUYOMI. Please select from the options above or provide your analytical requirements directly.`

**Direct Activation:**
```
Initialize TSUKUYOMI for intelligence operations, classification level [UNCLASSIFIED/CONFIDENTIAL/SECRET]
```

**Menu Selection:**
Users can select by number (1-9) or provide analysis requests directly, bypassing the menu.

**Return to Menu:**
Users can return to the main menu at any time by typing:
```
menu
```
System responds: `//AMATERASU: Returning to main menu. Please select from the options below.`

### Configuration Options
- `enable_splash_screen: true/false` - Toggle splash screen display
- `compact_display: true/false` - Use compact formatting
- `menu_return_command: true` - Enable menu return capability
- Menu can be disabled for direct operational use

## Security Considerations

The framework implements comprehensive security protocols:
- Classification-aware processing (UNCLASSIFIED through TOP SECRET)
- Handling instructions (NOFORN, REL TO, EYES ONLY, etc.)
- Source protection and OPSEC compliance
- Compartmentalization and need-to-know enforcement
- IC-standard analytical tradecraft (ICD 203, ICD 206)

## Stakeholder Optimization

AMATERASU personality core adapts communication for:
- **Executive Level**: High-level summaries, strategic implications
- **Operational Commanders**: Mission-focused, actionable intelligence
- **Intelligence Analysts**: Technical depth, methodology transparency
- **Field Operators**: Concise, security-aware communications
- **International Partners**: Cultural sensitivity, legal compliance

## Working with the Framework

When making changes to this repository:
- Preserve the modular architecture and JSON schema compliance
- Maintain security protocols and classification handling
- Follow the established execution sequences and error handling patterns
- Ensure personality core compatibility for new modules
- Test module integration with the core orchestration system
- Ensure system is a 'prompt' framework that can be 'loaded' into LLM's & AI systems, not an 'executable' script

## Session Management

TSUKUYOMI includes comprehensive session management capabilities through dedicated modules that enable analytical continuity across LLM chat interfaces.

### Session Export Module
- **Comprehensive State Capture**: Exports complete operational context, workflow state, analytical findings, and continuation guidance
- **Security-Aware Processing**: Applies appropriate classification handling, sanitization protocols, and source protection
- **JSON Format**: Generates well-structured JSON files that are both human-readable and machine-parseable
- **Flexible Export Options**: Standard exports, sanitized exports for sharing, or findings-only exports

### Session Import Module  
- **Complete Restoration**: Reconstructs full operational context and analytical state from JSON snapshots
- **Validation Framework**: Comprehensive validation of import data for format compliance, security requirements, and data integrity
- **Seamless Continuation**: Enables immediate resumption of analytical operations at the exact point of previous export
- **Security Compliance**: Maintains strict adherence to classification and compartmentalization requirements

### Usage Examples
```
Export current session
Import session from [JSON_DATA]
Export session with sanitization for sharing
```

### Session File Structure
Session exports contain:
- **Metadata**: Session ID, timestamps, framework version
