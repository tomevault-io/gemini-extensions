Context for Claude Code working in this repository.

## What this repo is

The **mechanics** of elephant-mem — the plugin, the bundle scripts, the docs. It
holds no knowledge. A user's knowledge lives in their own bundle directory
outside this repo (default `~/elephant`), git-versioned locally and never pushed.

Two plugins ship from one marketplace (`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`):

| directory | plugin | what it is |
|---|---|---|
| `plugin/` | `elephant-mem` | the memory itself — the mode-skills, scripts, templates |
| `elephant-wiki/` | `elephant-wiki` | optional static wiki over a bundle, a `post_ingest` subscriber |

## Versioning: two independent cycles

`elephant-mem` and `elephant-wiki` version **separately**. They are distinct
plugins, installed separately, and the wiki changes far less often — as of
`elephant-mem` 0.1.0-beta.7 the wiki is on 0.1.0-beta.4. A gap between the two
numbers is expected and is **not** a sign the wiki is behind.

What follows from that:

- **Bump only the plugin whose files changed.** A change under `plugin/` bumps
  `plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`; a change under `elephant-wiki/` bumps
  `elephant-wiki/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`. A change touching both bumps both.
- **Each plugin has its own tag namespace.** `v0.1.0-beta.N` is `elephant-mem`;
  `wiki-v0.1.0-beta.N` is `elephant-wiki`. The prefix keeps the two disjoint, so
  `git tag -l 'v*'` still lists `elephant-mem` releases and nothing else.
  - Wiki tags start at `wiki-v0.1.0-beta.4`. Before that the wiki carried no
    tags; those older sections stay as they are — don't retro-tag them.
  - **A wiki tag is documentation, not delivery.** Nothing machine-reads it (see
    below): the marketplace and `update` both serve `main`. So a forgotten wiki
    tag costs you archaeology, while a forgotten `elephant-mem` bump withholds
    the update prompt from every installed user. Not the same kind of mistake.
- **Each plugin owns its CHANGELOG.** `CHANGELOG.md` at the root is
  `elephant-mem`'s; `elephant-wiki/CHANGELOG.md` is the wiki's. A change under
  `elephant-wiki/` is written up there, in the same house style, and **not** in
  the root file. Date its section by the day the `wiki-v*` tag is cut, which is
  the day it lands on `main` — that is what the marketplace serves.
  - Up to wiki 0.1.0-beta.2 the convention was the opposite: those bumps were
    recorded inline in the `elephant-mem` section that shipped them ("Also in
    this release: …", see 0.1.0-beta.5). That history was left where it is and
    is linked from the wiki's own file; don't move it, and don't add new inline
    notes.
- **Only `elephant-mem`'s version is machine-read.** The `update` mode fetches
  `plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` from `main` and compares it to the
  installed one. Nothing reads the wiki's `version`; it is there for the
  marketplace and for humans. So a forgotten wiki bump is cosmetic, while a
  forgotten `elephant-mem` bump silently withholds the update prompt from every
  installed user.
- **A release is not reachable the moment it lands on `main`.** `marketplace.json`
  carries no `version` — it points at `./plugin`, so the version the CLI sees comes
  from `plugin.json` **at the commit the user's local marketplace clone sits on**
  (`~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/elephant-mem`, a checkout tracking `main`).
  Until they run `claude plugin marketplace update`, `claude plugin update` reports
  them current at an older version. This is the single explanation for "the CLI says
  I'm on the latest but the badge says otherwise" — not a lag in a published
  catalog, which is the wrong answer that keeps getting reached for. Nothing in
  release procedure fixes it, so `update` and the README both print the refresh
  command first.

## Cutting a release

Do this on a branch, land it through a PR, then tag the **merge commit** — the
`v0.1.0-beta.6` tag points at the merge of #5, which is the pattern to follow.

1. **Bump** the `version` in the `plugin.json` of each plugin whose files
   changed (see above).
2. **CHANGELOG** — open or finish the `## [<version>] - <date>` section in the
   CHANGELOG of each plugin that was bumped (root for `elephant-mem`,
   `elephant-wiki/CHANGELOG.md` for the wiki). For `elephant-mem` the date is
   the day the release is **tagged**, not the day the section was started; fix
   it at tag time if the work spanned days. Keep the house style: a short lead
   paragraph saying what was actually wrong, then
   `### Added` / `### Changed` / `### Fixed`.
3. **README** — update the version badge(s) in the centered header block.
4. **Tag and release**, annotated, with a title:

   ```
   git tag -a v0.1.0-beta.N <merge-sha> -m "v0.1.0-beta.N — <short title>"
   git push origin v0.1.0-beta.N
   gh release create v0.1.0-beta.N --title "v0.1.0-beta.N — <short title>" --notes "<the CHANGELOG section>"
   ```

5. **Verify** the tag is reachable from `main` and that CI on `main` is green —
   `update` serves `main`, so an untagged bump still reaches users while a tag
   with no bump reaches no one.

## Conventions

- **Prose over bullets in the CHANGELOG.** Entries explain the failure that
  motivated the change, in the past tense, with the measurement when there was
  one. They read as findings, not as a diff summary.
- **Commits** are conventional (`fix(catch-up):`, `feat:`, `chore:`, `docs:`)
  and the subject states the substance, not the file touched.
- **Everything lands through a PR**, with CI green. `main` is the published
  surface — `update` reads `plugin.json` straight off it.
- **Repo docs are in English** (README, CHANGELOG, `docs/`, skill files), even
  when the conversation is in Portuguese. A bundle's own content follows its
  `conversation_language`.
- **The seed `config.md` reaches new bundles only.** `init` copies
  `plugin/assets/seed/config.md` into the bundle once, and `update` re-syncs
  `scripts/` and `templates/` and deliberately never `config.md` — it is the
  user's file to edit. So every bundle already on disk carries a diverged copy
  that no edit to the seed will ever reach; correcting a fact there is a manual
  step for its owner. Fix the seed anyway, and never read a live bundle's
  `config.md` as if it said what the seed says.

## Tests

**Not pytest.** Every suite in `tests/` is a standalone script run directly with
`python tests/<name>.py`, exiting non-zero on failure — the scripts under test
are Python 3 stdlib only, and the tests keep that property so CI needs no
install step. Run them all before committing:

```
for t in tests/*.py; do python3 "$t" || echo "FAIL $t"; done
```

Not `validate-okf.py` on its own: a bundle script run from this checkout would
resolve its bundle as `plugin/assets/`, and every one of them now refuses to
start there. It used to "pass" against `plugin/assets/knowledge/`, four empty
derived files a stray run had created and a `git add -A` had committed — a
vacuous check over an accident. The suites cover the script properly: they
execute it 10 times against real throwaway bundles (13 module loads, counting
the three the tests import in-process to reach its functions).

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` lists each suite as **its own step**, across a
3-OS × PyYAML-on/off matrix (the frontmatter parser has two paths; both must
run). **A new suite is not picked up by a glob — add the `- run:` line
explicitly.** `test_backlog.py` shipped in 0.1.0-beta.7 and went a full release
unrun in CI because that line was missing.

Locally you likely have no PyYAML, so you exercise the fallback parser only; the
PyYAML path is covered in CI.
