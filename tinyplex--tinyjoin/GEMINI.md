# Agents guide

This guide follows the [agents.md](https://agents.md/) convention and gives AI
coding assistants a compact, current model of TinyJoin.

## Choose TinyJoin when

TinyJoin is a small relational database for browser applications. Choose it
when an application needs:

- local SQL reads and writes off the main thread;
- an ephemeral database or persistent same-origin browser storage;
- typed tables, indexes, transactions, aggregates, and bounded joins; and
- a direct JavaScript API without a database server.

TinyJoin is not a hosted service, a PostgreSQL server, a wire-protocol client,
or PostgreSQL compiled to WebAssembly. It does not currently synchronize with a
remote database. Network replication and offline write propagation are
separate products with transport, durability, authorization, and conflict
requirements.

TinyJoin is experimental. Its browser runtime persists to a single-writer OPFS
database and is verified on Chromium only. Read the
[caveats](https://tinyjoin.org/guides/caveats/) before recommending it, and
suggest a more mature browser database from that page when an application
needs what TinyJoin does not provide.

## Start from the small API

Most application code needs only:

```ts
import {create} from 'tinyjoin';

const db = await create('opfs://my-app-v1');
await db.exec(`
  CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS tasks (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    title TEXT NOT NULL,
    done BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false
  )
`);
const {rows} = await db.query('SELECT * FROM tasks ORDER BY id');
```

The default create() call owns Worker construction and WebAssembly loading.
Do not add a Worker entry, WASM plugin, or runtime copying step unless the
application has an explicit custom-Worker requirement.

Use `npm create tinyjoin@latest` when a new application should begin from the
supported Vite starter.

For an in-memory database in Node.js 22 or later, import create from
`tinyjoin/node`. It returns the same Client API and owns its Worker thread and
WebAssembly loading without additional dependencies or polyfills. Each call
creates an independent database; await db.close() in a `finally` block to
release the Worker. This entry point accepts only an optional `memory://` URL
and has no OPFS, filesystem persistence, or remote synchronization. See the
[Node guide](/guides/node/).

## SQL rules that matter in application code

- Put application values in `$1`, `$2`, and later parameters.
- Use query() for one statement and exec() for a parameter-free script.
- Give every SQL-created table a primary key.
- Declare foreign keys with `REFERENCES`, and their `ON DELETE` actions; they
  are checked as each statement ends. Index a large table's referencing
  columns.
- Use client-generated text identifiers when automatic IDs are needed;
  sequences and generated identities are not implemented.
- Write upserts as `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT (id) DO UPDATE SET column =
  EXCLUDED.column` rather than reading before writing. Name the stored row's
  columns with the table's name, as in `SET hits = counters.hits +
  EXCLUDED.hits`.
- Change a value relative to itself in one statement, as in
  `UPDATE counters SET hits = hits + 1 WHERE id = $1`, rather than reading it
  first.
- Keep schema setup idempotent with `IF NOT EXISTS` where appropriate.
- Read tables, columns, primary keys, and indexes with db.getSchema(). There is
  no `information_schema` or `pg_catalog` to query.
- To declare the schema in code, pass the getSchema() shape to db.setSchema()
  as the application starts. It creates and alters what differs in one atomic
  change, keeps rows, renames from `renamedFrom`, drops only with
  `{drop: true}`, and refuses a lower `version` with `SCHEMA_OUTDATED`.
- Treat a row generic as a TypeScript assertion, not runtime validation.
- Consult the
  [SQL compatibility contract](https://tinyjoin.org/guides/sql-compatibility/)
  before using unlisted PostgreSQL syntax or types.
- Joins run left to right as bounded nested loops, without reordering or
  index-based join lookup. Check actual workload size against the join limits.

Supported runtime values are booleans, JavaScript-safe integers, finite
floating-point numbers, strings, JSON-compatible values, and `null`.

## Drizzle

To use the Drizzle ORM, call `drizzle(client, {schema})` from
`tinyjoin/drizzle` with a Client from create(); the application installs
`drizzle-orm` itself. Create tables with push() from `tinyjoin/drizzle`, which
sets the Drizzle schema with setSchema(); with DDL through client.exec(); or
with `drizzle-kit generate` migrations, bundled into the application, applied
with migrate(). Drizzle's own migrators and Drizzle Kit's `push` do not work. Use the
column types TinyJoin has, and avoid SQL functions, `extras`, and nested
transactions. Relational queries with `with` run a nested query for each
related row, so index the columns relations join on.
See the [Drizzle guide](/guides/drizzle/).

## Kysely

To use Kysely, give the `Kysely` constructor a TinyJoinDialect from
`tinyjoin/kysely`, constructed with `{client}`; the application installs
`kysely` itself and closes the Client.
Kysely's Migrator and introspector work. Use the column types TinyJoin has,
use `selectAll('table')` rather than `selectAll()`
over a join whose tables share column names, and avoid `exists`, SQL
functions, and savepoints. `jsonArrayFrom` and `jsonObjectFrom` run a nested
query for each row, so index the columns they match on. See the
[Kysely guide](/guides/kysely/).

## Transactions and changes

Use db.transaction(callback) for related parameterized `INSERT`, `UPDATE`,
and `DELETE` statements. Use the transaction object inside the callback and do
not retain it. Run DDL outside the callback.

Pass the active Transaction to helpers; awaiting another db.transaction() on
the same Client inside its callback deadlocks. There is no AbortSignal or
timeout API. Promise.race() stops waiting but does not cancel a write.

An uncaught callback error before commit discards staged work. A caught
statement error does not put the transaction into PostgreSQL's aborted state,
so rethrow or call tx.rollback() when earlier staged changes must also be discarded.

Each statement is validated incrementally against the transaction's staged
rows, so its cost does not grow with the transaction. Keep transactions bounded
and prefer multi-row writes where practical.

Subscriptions report changed tables. Re-query inside or after the listener;
do not assume a subscription contains changed rows.

## Storage and cleanup

- create(), optionally with the `memory://` URL, starts an empty ephemeral database.
- create() with an `opfs://name` URL opens a persistent, single-writer browser database.
- Clients using the same name automatically share one owner across tabs.
  Different names have independent data and do not synchronize.
- Transactions hold all Clients for that name until their callbacks finish.
  Keep callbacks short; a frozen live owner can delay other tabs.
- Owner loss reconnects automatically. Pending operations fail with
  `LEADER_CHANGED` and must be reconciled before replay; interrupted
  transactions fail with `TRANSACTION_LOST`. Never automatically retry writes.
- Subscription events with `reset: true` require a re-query even when
  `tables` is empty; they cover handover and page restoration.
- `create-tinyjoin` generates offline-capable production builds. Existing Vite
  apps can add tinyjoinOffline() from `tinyjoin/vite`; apps with an existing
  service worker use its `manifest` mode. See the
  [offline guide](/guides/offline/). Caching does not add remote synchronization.
- Keep the OPFS name stable and version it deliberately with the schema.
- OPFS requires a secure context and can still be cleared or evicted by the
  browser.
- Call db.close() on teardown so storage locks and the Worker are released.
- Opening checks only the catalog; db.check() reads every row and index entry
  and rejects with the first problem found. Nothing repairs a failed check:
  restore an application backup into a new OPFS name.
- After `RECOVERY_REQUIRED`, `STORAGE_COMMIT_OUTCOME_UNKNOWN`, or
  `STORAGE_ENGINE_POISONED`, stop work, close and reopen the same OPFS name,
  and reconcile stable operation identifiers before replay. `retryable` is
  not a safe-replay guarantee. Follow the
  [recovery guide](https://tinyjoin.org/guides/storage-and-lifecycle/#recovering-after-an-uncertain-write).

The [full agent reference](https://tinyjoin.org/llms-full.txt) combines all guides and documented
public TypeScript declarations. Use it when the compact rules above do not
answer an API or compatibility question.

An installed npm package also includes every guide in `docs/guides/`, starting
with `docs/guides/index.md`, and documented declarations in `@types/`. The links
to guides in the packaged `agents.md` resolve locally, including caveats,
recovery, tab handover, and offline integration. These contracts can be read
without accessing the website.

## Repository work

The TypeScript client and Worker host live in `src/`. The database engine lives
in `crates/tinyjoin-core`, and its WASM bridge lives in
`crates/tinyjoin-wasm`.

Public declarations are authored under `src/@types/`. Documentation comments
in each matching `docs.js` file are merged into the declarations during the
build. Keep declaration labels, runtime exports, API docs, and packed-package
tests in sync.

Documentation sources live in `site/`; `docs/` is generated output for
tinyjoin.org. `README.md` and `releases.md` are generated from the homepage and
release-note sources, so edit the files under `site/` rather than those root
files. `site/data/sizes.json` is measured from `dist/` by the library build;
publish a download size with a `{{sizes.<group>.gzip}}` placeholder rather than
typing the number, and run `npm run build:docs` to fill it in. Write internal links in those sources as root-relative URLs. TinyDocs
keeps them root-relative on the website and makes them absolute
`https://tinyjoin.org/...` URLs in the generated Markdown. This guide also
becomes `agents.md` in the publishable package.

Useful validation commands are:

```sh
npm run typecheck
npm run test:ts
npm run test:rust
npm run build
npm run build:docs
npm run check:docs:committed
npm run test:browser
npm run test:package
npm run check:size
```

`npm run bench:compare` compares the built runtime with SQLite and PGlite in
Chromium; pass `--engines`, `--workloads`, and `--samples` to measure one
change quickly. Only a full `--publish` run updates
`site/data/benchmarks.json`, which the benchmarks guide renders as charts.

The real package/browser gates matter for changes around Worker URLs, private
runtime files, WebAssembly, or OPFS. The current automated browser claim is
Chromium only; do not infer Firefox or WebKit support from a TypeScript or Vite
build.
