# Project Context

## Meta-Protocol Principles

- `Constraint-Driven Evolution`: Add structure when real project constraints justify it.
- `Single Source of Truth`: Keep durable protocol, open work, completed delivery, and docs in separate files.
- `Context Hygiene`: Compress stale context before it becomes coordination drag.
- `Boundary Clarity`: README is the human entrypoint, `AGENTS.md` is durable protocol, `BACKLOG.md` is open work, and `CHANGELOG.md` is delivery history.

## Concept

`pi-actors` is a local-first actor runtime and orchestrator for Pi. It wraps trusted local programs, scripts, services, pipelines, and recipes as addressable actors that agents can `spawn`, control with typed `message` envelopes, and observe with `inspect`. It also persists user/agent-registered actor-control tools as recipe files under `~/.pi/agent/recipes`, giving agents durable operational muscle memory for launching and managing the local actor zoo.

Treat this extension as an experimental self-evolution membrane for the agent harness: a way for agents that are not pretrained on local workflows to acquire, preserve, inspect, and refine operational capabilities through explicit local actors, recipes, fixtures, skills, and state rather than hidden assumptions. Keep that potential grounded in small, testable, operator-visible protocol slices.

## Topology

```text
Pi host
  -> index.ts composition root
     -> lib/tools*.ts / prompts.ts      public tool + injected prompt surface
     -> lib/runtime.ts / registry.ts     active user recipe tools
     -> lib/recipes-*.ts                 packaged/user/draft recipe discovery
     -> lib/async-runs.ts                spawn lifecycle and run state
     -> lib/rooms.ts               room, roster, mailbox, communication log
     -> scripts/*.mjs                    self-contained process entrypoints
     -> recipes/*.json                   packaged actor components
     -> skills/* + docs/*                agent guidance and transportable specs
```

- `/index.ts`: Minimal extension coordinator/composition root. It wires live pi ports and should avoid owning domain behavior.

## Domain Modules

- `/lib/*.ts`: Flat Domain DAG modules for cohesive reusable behavior.
  - `command-templates.ts`: portable command-template execution graph.
  - `tools-access.ts`: shared public tool access/session ownership guards and normalized mismatch diagnostics.
  - `tools-mailbox.ts`: mailbox contract normalization and accepted/emitted message type helpers for public tool responses.
  - `schema.ts`: tool arg declarations and placeholder-derived schemas.
  - `identity.ts`, `paths.ts`, `config.ts`: names, paths, and persistence.
  - `registry.ts`, `runtime.ts`: register/update/delete, load/conflict/registration coordination.
  - `execution.ts`, `execution-output.ts`, `limits.ts`: registered-tool execution and bounded output.
  - `recipes-references.ts`, `recipes-discovery.ts`, `recipes-usage.ts`: recipe graph, discovery, and usage metadata.
  - `async-runs.ts`: detached run lifecycle facade; `runs-*` subdomains own artifacts, start guards, status, indexes, inbox/outbox, delivery, process control, and retention internals.
  - `runtime-notifier.ts`, `mailbox-loop.ts`: wake notifications and reusable run/branch mailbox worker loops.
  - `messages.ts`, `rooms.ts`, `recipes-context.ts`, `inspector.ts`, `observability.ts`: addressed message protocol, rooms, recipe prompt context, communication previews, and ambient run status.
  - `prompts.ts`, `temp.ts`: LLM-facing copy and temp cleanup.
  - `tools.ts`: public tool family composition and reserved tool names.
  - `tools-message.ts`: public `message` tool behavior, including run controls, branch/room routing, tool actor invocation, and delivery feedback.
  - `tools-inspect.ts`: public `inspect` tool behavior, including recipe registry, room/session/tool/run views, and observation formatting.
  - `tools-spawn.ts`: public `spawn` tool behavior, including actor launch, draft recipe capture, and launch diagnostics.
  - `tools-local.ts`: saved local capability execution, generated schemas, value normalization, and async recipe launch.
  - `tools-register.ts`: public `register_tool` behavior and schema for persisted local capability registration.
  - `tools-response.ts`: compact model-facing responses and next-action rendering shared by public tool execution paths.

## Repo Surfaces

- `/scripts/*.mjs`: Stable executables for detached/helper processes. Prefer self-contained script ownership; do not preemptively move script logic into `lib/` just to make scripts thin.
- `/lib/*.ts`: Compiled reusable domains for the extension/runtime. Move script behavior into `lib/` only when it has real non-script consumers or belongs to an existing reusable domain. Packaged JS-only execution, tests, or shim neatness alone do not justify a new `lib/` domain.
- `/recipes/*.json`: Packaged standard recipe library. Keep recipes optional, composable, policy-light, and caller-configurable.
- `/skills/actors/SKILL.md`: Dense practical reference for operating pi-actors itself.
- `/skills/swarm/SKILL.md`: Bundled methodology skill for multi-agent standards, strategies, and portable examples.
- `/tests/*.test.ts`: Focused regression tests for pure domains.
- `/README.md`: Human-facing install, usage, and runtime semantics.
- `/BACKLOG.md`: Canonical open work; only completable future work.
- `/CHANGELOG.md`: Completed delivery history.
- `/docs/README.md`: Documentation index.

## Operating Principles

- Prefer explicit operator action over silent user-config rewrites.
- Keep published documentation portable: use `~`, `<repo>`, or relative paths instead of machine-local absolute paths.
- Preserve runtime output discipline because tool output flows directly into agent context.
- Optimize every actor-facing surface for signal over volume: prefer compact state-backed hints and fewer concepts over broad explanatory prose or speculative guidance.
- Split broad domains proactively when the current name becomes a generic bucket. Prefer concise domain names that match actual ownership. `tools.ts` is the public tool family owner; decomposed tool subdomains use `tools-<part>.ts` (`tools-message.ts`, `tools-inspect.ts`, `tools-spawn.ts`) under that family. Keep only genuinely cross-family domains unprefixed (`schema.ts`); tool-only helpers stay under `tools-*`. If a `tools-*` helper becomes reused by non-tools domains, remove the `tools-` prefix in the same slice and update ownership comments/imports so the name matches its broader responsibility. Avoid redundant internal `actor-` file prefixes in this actor-scoped package unless the file is deliberately tied to a public actor-named recipe/script/docs surface.
- Until a stable release greater than `1.x.x`, favor context compression over compatibility shims: do not preserve legacy actor-facing names, aliases, fields, env vars, paths, or docs solely for backward compatibility when a clearer current term exists. Remove compatibility layers in the same slice that renames a concept, and record the break in `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Keep the project lens local-first and cybernetic: agents wrap durable local capabilities as actors, then use semantic tools and messages instead of repeatedly reconstructing shell commands.
- Design recipes as agent-callable tools: make prompts, scopes, paths, models, and policy knobs public args/defaults when the caller should decide them at invocation time.
- Decompose oversized bullets into sublists or hierarchy; long flat list items are a context-smell.

## Knowledge Surfaces

- Injected prompt: tiny bootstrap/reminder, never full docs.
- Skill header: routing metadata that tells agents when to load a bundled skill.
- Skill body: dense agent-facing operating manual for the matched concern.
- README: public face of the project. Keep it current, focused, pruned, and limited to highest-signal scenarios.
- `actors` skill: runtime/tooling manual for operating the extension and navigating high-value bundled recipes.
- `swarm` skill: multi-agent methodology, strategies, standards, and portable examples.
- `/docs`: detailed transportable standards read on demand.
- `AGENTS.md`: durable project protocol for agents changing this repo.
- Skill evolution is passive-active: when implementation yields durable mechanics, invariants, warnings, or orchestration lessons, update `skills/actors/SKILL.md` or `skills/swarm/SKILL.md` immediately instead of carrying evergreen skill-upkeep items in `BACKLOG.md`.

## Public Actor Model

- Preserve the public verbs: `spawn`, `message`, `inspect`.
- Keep the model-facing concept ladder minimal: core is run actors, typed messages, intentional inspection, artifacts, and recipe/tool memory; group messaging, roster, branches, sessions, and diagnostics are advanced surfaces.
- Prefer one typed actor-message envelope for upward, downward, lateral, parent/branch, and branch/parent messages.
- Prefer actor addresses and inspect views over exposing FIFO, outbox, or status mechanics as public concepts.
- Keep route and semantic type separate: delivery behavior comes from `to`, while `type` describes intent.
- Treat dotted message types as the minimal action surface: `channel.action` should often be enough for script-backed actors, with `body` reserved for extra context or free-form prompts to LLM-backed actors.

## Runtime Contract

- Register trusted command templates with placeholder-derived args, progressive typed arg declarations, inline/default/`??`/ternary fallback, and split-first command argv construction.
- Keep command templates synchronous and portable; `async: true` is the detached run switch.
- Preserve node controls: `when`, positive `timeout`, `delay`, bounded `retry`, `failure`, and `recover` cleanup.
- Keep async run state under `~/.pi/agent/tmp/pi-actors/runs` with injected `{run_id}` and `{state_dir}` values.
- Preserve event-driven observability: terminal follow-ups, coordinator-bound outbox messages, branch-aware triangles, process-tree expansion, and bounded body previews.
- Do not restore busy-polling examples, duplicate terminal follow-ups, or duplicate follow-ups for handled `cancel`, `kill`, or control-stop actions.

## Recipes And Registry

- `~/.pi/agent/recipes/*.json` is executable muscle memory: recipes there become persistent tools by location.
- Preserve filename identity, atomic writes, explicit operator-gated changes, and local transportability.
- Packaged/ad hoc recipes outside the agent root are components, not user tools.
- Register existing recipes by importing them from the user-root wrapper and using a `{ "name": "alias" }` template node; do not duplicate a ready recipe's script command, defaults, mailbox, or artifact contract in the wrapper.
- Skill-owned scripts must be exposed through skill-owned recipes first. If a local tool needs that capability, import the skill recipe via `{agent}/skills/<skill>/recipes/<recipe>.json` instead of calling `{agent}/skills/<skill>/scripts/*` directly.
- Tool definitions use `template`, not `script`, and built-in/core tool names must not be shadowed.
- Packaged recipe growth is demand-driven: prefer reusable components over speculative scenario catalogs.
- Recipe templates may point directly at executable helper scripts when the recipe owns that script boundary; keep script executable bits and avoid unnecessary `node` prefixes.

## Command And Recipe Layers

- Keep command-template semantics in `docs/command-templates.md`.
- Keep recipe storage/import/default/reference behavior in `docs/template-recipes.md`.
- Keep detached lifecycle/state/IPC behavior in `docs/async-runs.md`.
- Imported recipes are command-template-shaped definitions, not async-run instances.
- Valid chain: `tool → template → recipe → run → template`; reject cyclic shortcuts.
- Typed args support `string`, `path`, `int`, `number`, `bool`, `array`, and `enum(...)`.
- Preserve both metadata-first args and inline-first placeholder style.

## State, IO, And Safety

- Tool stdout and temp state must stay bounded and local.
- Feedback hints must be evidence-backed, bounded, and action-shaped; prefer `next_actions` pointing to existing verbs over prose, and avoid hints when no concrete next step is justified.
- Keep tail truncation, full-output temp files, failure formatting, and centralized limits intact.
- Published docs must not include machine-local absolute paths.
- Any view scanning run directories must apply coordinator/session ownership filters before exposing summaries or previews.
- Direct branch messages are active inbox queues; guard branch-local append/status rewrites with the branch inbox lock and keep claim/handled/failed transitions tested.
- Room/branch provenance checks should validate that accepted `from` addresses belong to the addressed run.

## Coordination And Lifecycle

- Persistent implementer workflows are recipe composition, not one-off scripts.
- Compose cells such as `coordinator-locker`, subagent launchers, actor-message utilities, and mailbox-loop helpers.
- Preserve JSON envelope object shape across handoffs.
- Keep locker state generic and thin; orchestration strategy belongs in the coordinator.
- Graceful actor retirement is opt-in through recipe/run metadata and must not infer retirement for persistent services or backlog implementers.
- Script helpers that spawn long-lived child processes should keep those children inside the async run's owned process group unless they also provide an explicit termination bridge; `control.kill` must not leave detached playback/service descendants alive.
- True daemon recipes are allowed, but daemon ownership belongs to the recipe/script contract: persist a pid or service handle, verify ownership before signaling, expose status/stop semantics, and bridge `control.kill` to daemon cleanup instead of relying on the generic runner to discover detached services.

## Context And Planning Hygiene

- `BACKLOG.md` is planning, not history: only completable future work with current scope and exit criteria.
- Completed delivery belongs in `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Durable/evergreen behavior belongs in `AGENTS.md`, README, docs, or skills.
- Changelog bullets describe meaningful user/operator/developer changes, not release bookkeeping.
- PR/release summaries are temporary artifacts; keep durable release evidence in `CHANGELOG.md` and gates in `BACKLOG.md`.
- Meaningful implementation or docs changes must reconcile `BACKLOG.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, README, and docs navigation.

## Validation

- `npm run check`: Lightweight extension-load sanity check.
- `npm test`: Focused regression tests for extracted pure domains.
- `npm run pack:dry`: Verify package contents and npm metadata.
- `npm run conformance`: Compact protocol conformance runner for actor/recipe behavior.

## Pre-Task Preparation

1. Read this file, `BACKLOG.md`, and `README.md`.
2. Inspect `index.ts` around the touched tool/runtime path.
3. Prefer targeted edits over broad rewrites.
4. Run the smallest validation set that covers the touched scope.

## Task Completion Protocol

1. Reconcile backlog state with reality: close, narrow, split, defer, or gate items explicitly.
2. Update README/docs when public behavior, setup, package contents, or navigation changes.
3. Record meaningful delivered slices in `CHANGELOG.md`.
4. Run relevant validation and report exact commands.
