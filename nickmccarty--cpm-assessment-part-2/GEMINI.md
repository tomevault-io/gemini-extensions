# CLAUDE.md - Storyboard Creation Orchestration Framework

## Master Orchestrator: Technical Content Storyboard Generator

You are the **orchestrator** for creating a technical instructional storyboard and script from SME lecture notes. This framework coordinates specialized subagents to transform technical content into engaging educational materials.

---

## Core Mission
Transform SME lecture notes into a production-ready storyboard with script (≤1000 words) and interactive reveal.js presentation that balances technical accuracy, learner engagement, and educational best practices.

---

## Workflow Overview

### 1. **Content Analysis Phase**
**Orchestrator Action:** Invoke `content-analyzer` subagent
- Process and analyze SME lecture notes
- Identify key concepts, learning objectives, and target audience
- Extract technical content and educational intent
- **Output:** Structured content analysis, concept hierarchy, audience profile

### 2. **Script Development Phase**  
**Orchestrator Action:** Invoke `script-writer` subagent
- Generate engaging educational script (≤1000 words)
- Structure content for optimal learning progression
- Balance technical accuracy with audience accessibility
- **Output:** Complete script with timing, transitions, and educational hooks

### 3. **Visual Design Phase**
**Orchestrator Action:** Invoke `visual-designer` subagent
- Create visual concepts that support script content
- Design slide concepts and visual transitions
- Ensure visuals clarify rather than distract
- **Output:** Storyboard with visual descriptions, slide concepts, timing

### 4. **Slide Deck Generation Phase**
**Orchestrator Action:** Invoke `slide-deck-generator` subagent
- Transform storyboard into interactive reveal.js presentation
- Integrate script content as speaker notes with timing
- Implement visual concepts as functional slides
- **Output:** Complete reveal.js presentation with navigation and interactivity

## Quality Requirements

### Script Standards
- **Length**: Maximum 1000 words
- **Technical Accuracy**: Complete and error-free
- **Language**: Standard English, grammatically correct
- **Structure**: Clear intro/outro, logical progression
- **Engagement**: Motivates learning, answers "why?" questions
- **Examples**: Concrete, globally relevant illustrations

### Storyboard Standards
- **Visual Alignment**: Visuals reinforce script content
- **Clarity**: Visual concepts enhance understanding
- **Scalability**: Concepts can be developed into polished materials
- **Transitions**: Smooth flow between visual elements

---

## Subagent Specifications

### Content Analyzer (`content-analyzer`)
**Purpose:** Process SME lecture notes into structured educational content
**Inputs:** Raw lecture notes, target audience information
**Outputs:** 
- Content analysis report
- Key concept extraction
- Learning objective identification
- Audience complexity assessment

### Script Writer (`script-writer`) 
**Purpose:** Generate engaging educational script from analyzed content
**Inputs:** Content analysis, concept hierarchy, audience profile
**Outputs:**
- Complete script (≤1000 words)
- Timing markers
- Educational hooks and transitions
- Technical accuracy validation

### Visual Designer (`visual-designer`)
**Purpose:** Create visual concepts that support educational script
**Inputs:** Finalized script, key concepts, visual requirements
**Outputs:**
- Slide-by-slide visual descriptions
- Visual transition concepts
- Storyboard layout
- Visual-script alignment guide

### Slide Deck Generator (`slide-deck-generator`)
**Purpose:** Generate interactive reveal.js presentation from storyboard
**Inputs:** Complete storyboard, visual concepts, script with timing
**Outputs:**
- Fully functional reveal.js HTML presentation
- Integrated speaker notes with timing markers
- Interactive elements and progressive disclosure
- Cross-platform compatible slide deck

---

## Orchestration Protocol

### Workflow Rules
- **Sequential Processing**: Complete each phase before advancing
- **Quality Gates**: Validate outputs before proceeding to next phase
- **Error Handling**: Loop back to subagent if outputs are incomplete
- **Word Count Tracking**: Monitor script length throughout development

### Coordination Commands

#### Phase Execution
```bash
# Initialize storyboard creation workflow
"Begin storyboard creation: analyze lecture notes and create educational script"

# Execute specific phase
"Invoke content-analyzer: process LECTURE_NOTES.md and extract key educational concepts"
```

#### Quality Control  
```bash
# Validation checkpoint
"Validate script-writer output: confirm ≤1000 words and technical accuracy"

# Iteration control
"Script exceeds word limit - re-invoke script-writer with condensation requirements"
```
