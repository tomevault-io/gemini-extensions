## Project scope

This repository releases a 64-bit `d3d11.dll` and a 32-bit settings-launcher `msimg32.dll` for the Steam releases of Atelier Rorona DX, Atelier Totori DX, and Atelier Meruru DX, covering both the English and the multilingual (Japanese/Chinese) executables. Keep the released implementation Arland-specific. Atelier Ayesha support is under investigation but must remain disabled until its atlas-only path is validated. Do not add support code for newer Atelier games; direct those users to upstream `atelier-sync-fix` instead.

The current tree contains:

- D3D11 CPU shadow-copy synchronization;
- coherent Map/Unmap handling with deferred shadow uploads;
- successful `.PSSG` path-validation caching for all three Arland games;
- a queue-scoped font-atlas read cache for all three games, extended to the complete menu-construction frame in Rorona, and extended across frames in Meruru while a conversation balloon is live (the conversation text-render cache);
- old-Arland render-target and viewport/scissor correction;
- old-Arland game-side 1440p/4K render-target and raster correction;
- signature-gated launcher mode injection and an optional INI resolution override;
- optional high-resolution shadow-map twins (`ShadowMultiplier`);
- SMAA anti-aliasing applied before UI composition, at a per-title draw boundary (Totori injects at a depth-state change, Rorona and Meruru at the scene render target);
- high-resolution UI text rendered from bundled scalable fonts, on the English builds;
- frame-rate-independent field movement in all three games and travel-map analog cursor movement in Totori and Meruru;
- Rorona battle-shadow restoration, battle-state tracking with a battle-end watchdog, and the optional cut-in shadow/dim handling (all three games, both builds), all in `src/engines/phyre/battle_shadow_restore.cpp`;
- a per-game capability matrix (`src/core/game.cpp`) that centralizes feature availability and defaults;
- crash post-mortem logging and log rotation.

## Repository layout

- `src/core/` — engine-agnostic: the DLL entry points (`main.cpp`), the per-game capability matrix (`game.cpp`), the `arland-fix.ini` layer (`config.cpp`), the MinHook install helpers and per-game `Game` descriptor (`hook_util.{h,cpp}`), the proxy vtable dispatch types (`d3d11_procs.h`), guarded game-memory reads (`mem.h`), companion-file path building shared with the 32-bit DLL (`path_util.h`), the pipeline-state save and restore the post-process passes share (`pipeline_state.h`), the page-patch transaction (`page_patch.h`), the SMAA, supersampling and sharpening passes, crash logging, and the controller and window corrections that name no game. `.def` files export the DLL symbols.
- `src/engines/phyre/` — the PhyreEngine work all three Arland games share, which is everything carrying a per-build address: the D3D11 proxy layer (`sync_fix.cpp`), with the cut-in shadow feature carved into `battle_shadows.cpp` behind `sync_internal.h`; the executable-specific menu hooks (`menu_fix.cpp`), with the battle-shadow-restore subsystem carved into `battle_shadow_restore.cpp` behind `menu_internal.h`; high-resolution UI text (`font_hires.cpp`); and the field, save-menu, item, shop, stream, world-map and startup fixes.

  Singular on purpose, and there is no dispatch layer: Rorona, Totori and Meruru are all PhyreEngine, so unlike the Dusk project there is only ever one module. The directory exists because the two repositories carry about forty files in common, and identical paths are what make a drift between them visible in a diff rather than only in a review.
- `src/launcher/` — both launcher pieces, neither of which shares code with the game DLL: `launcher_gui.cpp` is the 64-bit `arland-fix-launcher.exe` settings window, and `launcher_proxy.cpp` the 32-bit `msimg32.dll` that redirects Koei Tecmo's own front-end to it.
- `vendor/minhook/` contains the unmodified vendored MinHook dependency and its license; `vendor/stb/` holds stb_truetype; `vendor/font/` holds the bundled replacement fonts (`.ttf`) and the per-glyph fallback face.
- `scripts/embed_font.py` compiles the vendored fonts into the DLL at build time; the generated sources live under the build directory and are not committed.
- `.github/workflows/build.yml` builds and publishes both Windows DLLs.
- `README.md` is the user-facing overview: what the mod does per game, and how to install it. It is the only prose document in the repository.
- The settings launcher is the option surface. No ini ships: the mod writes `arland-fix.ini` itself, and the launcher writes it again on every Save. Environment switches are diagnostics and must not be given a key.

Keep the root minimal. Packaged build output belongs below ignored `out/` and must not be committed. The day-to-day Linux build script uses `build64/` and `build32/` as intermediate Meson trees before packaging the distributable archive into `out/`.

## Build

Use the repository's day-to-day Linux cross-build script from the repository root:

```sh
./scripts/build_linux.sh
```

It compiles the intermediate binaries as `build64/d3d11.dll`, `build64/arland-fix-launcher.exe`, and `build32/msimg32.dll`, verifies their required proxy exports through `scripts/check_exports.py`, then packages the distributable archive as `out/arland-fix-<VERSION>.zip`. The export check requires `D3D11CreateDevice` at ordinal 22, `D3D11CreateDeviceAndSwapChain` at ordinal 23 and `D3D11On12CreateDevice` at ordinal 24 in the game DLL, and `AlphaBlend` plus `TransparentBlt` in the launcher proxy. The mod does nothing with D3D11-on-12; that export exists because a tool injected alongside this one can import the name statically, and the loader fails the whole process on a missing static import before any code runs.

## Validation

After making changes, run the relevant validation scripts, including `scripts/check_launcher_contract.py`, `scripts/check_core_contract.py`, and `scripts/check_release_contract.py`. `scripts/build_linux.sh` runs all of these after a successful build except `check_option_surface.py`, which runs the launcher and so needs Windows; it runs in CI, or locally with `ARLAND_LAUNCHER_RUNNER=umu-run`. When a contract check fails, determine whether the change intentionally altered the contract. If it did, update the contract check and its accompanying documentation as needed. If it did not, treat the failure as a possible regression and investigate it rather than weakening or bypassing the check.

## Implementation rules

Safety and stability decide anything these rules leave open. The mod exists to correct defects in these games, so fixing a real one is always worth doing. The constraints are that a change must not break what already works, and that how a fix is implemented matters as much as what it fixes.

This mod injects into a running game and writes to engine-owned memory from the game's own render thread. The failures that matter are a hook installed against a build it does not match, a write through a pointer that is no longer valid, and engine state the mod changes and does not put back. Guard against all three every time, including on paths believed unreachable.

Prefer evidence to belief, and prefer static evidence. An offset read out of a build's disassembly holds for every run of that build; a probe reports only the runs you took, and a run that looked fine is not proof that a case cannot occur. Get the static answer where one exists. Where it rests on something the disassembly does not settle, a runtime check against the behaviour being replaced is what closes the gap, and the two together are what a claim of stability should rest on.

A refactor, or a performance idea with no measured problem behind it, is not a fix, and does not earn the risk of touching working code. Speculative machinery for a case that has been measured not to occur is the same trade. When ranking possible work, rank it by this.

- Preserve exact executable-name, `.text`-size, and prologue gating for game-code hooks.
- Unknown executables must remain unmodified apart from normal system-D3D11 forwarding.
- Cache only successful `.PSSG` validation results. Do not cache failures, parsed UI graphs, or mutable resource objects.
- Keep atlas snapshots inside the verified synchronous queue-drain lifetime in Meruru. Rorona and Totori may retain verified text-renderer snapshots until the next `Present`; invalidate a texture on any unmatched real lock and never retain snapshots across frames. That invalidation underpins both lifetimes and must never be gated on either of them.
- Internal D3D11 calls that touch a slot the mod hooks must go through the original entry points (`getContextProcs(ctx)->Fn(ctx, ...)`) so nothing recurses through the mod's own hooks; state queries on unhooked slots have no captured original and may use the interface directly. `gateHoldAtDraw` in `battle_shadows.cpp` is the reference example: its `UpdateSubresource` goes through the originals, its Get-queries do not need to. The mod's own present-time post-process passes (`ssaaDownscale`, `smaaRun`) are the exception and issue through the hooked context. The reason on record for that was multisampling, which was removed in 0.14: binding an SRV was what resolved a multisample twin into its host before the pass sampled it. Leave the passes on the hooked context until someone establishes what it still contributes; that has not been measured since the removal.
- Redirect staging shadows only on the immediate context. Flush before GPU consumers and before executing deferred command lists.
- Preserve per-resource/per-subresource lifetime tracking and COM reference ownership.
- Gate experimental behavior until it has passed clean-text, repeated-menu, and multiple-game validation.
- Keep launcher mutations in memory and signature-gated; never modify or redistribute Koei Tecmo executables.

## Configuration options

**No ini ships. The mod writes its own.** `configPath()` creates `arland-fix.ini` when it is absent and seeds the resolution keys, `ShadowMultiplier` and `Font` outright; the rest are seeded lazily by the read that wants them, with the feature table's default for the game actually running. The settings launcher then writes the file whenever the user saves. A shipped file could not do better: it would carry one set of values for three games, including keys a given game ignores.

That makes the launcher the option surface. A key the launcher does not offer is reachable only by someone who already knows its name, so adding an option means adding its control, and the default a user sees before the DLL has ever run is the launcher's own fallback rather than anything in the repository.

An option may still be deliberately ini-only, and the two `[Debug]` keys are: they are developer controls the Debug tab shows only when verbose logging is on. What that costs is discoverability, so it is a decision rather than an omission, and `scripts/check_option_surface.py` holds the list with the reason for each. Drifting into it is the thing to avoid: a key read behind a condition never appears for the user who leaves that feature off, and nobody has to decide anything for it to happen.

A correction is not a setting, so it gets no ini key at all: `FieldMonsterSnap`, `FieldCharacterPull` and `FastSaveMenu` lost theirs for that reason, keeping only their environment switches for a diagnostic run.

`[Battle] BattleCutInDimming` is the one key whose default cannot be read off its feature table cell: its `Descriptor` sets `invert`, so the key defaults to the opposite of the cell. Read `featureEnabled` rather than the table when you need its value.

## Documentation style

Do not hard-wrap markdown. Write one line per paragraph and let the editor or viewer wrap it; the same applies to markdown embedded elsewhere, such as the release notes generated in `.github/workflows/build.yml`. Line breaks stay meaningful only where they already are: fenced code blocks, tables, list items (one line each), headings and blockquotes.

Hard-wrapped prose makes diffs noisy — a reworded sentence reflows every line after it — and the wrap width never matches everyone's editor anyway. INI and source comments are the exception: keep wrapping those to the surrounding code width.

## Comments in the source

A comment earns its place by saying something the code cannot: an intent, a constraint, a fact about the game, an alternative that was tried and rejected. Restating the line below it is worse than useless, because it is one more thing that has to be kept true.

Write one where a reader would otherwise be stuck, or would guess wrong:

- What a file is for, at the top, where the filename does not already say it.
- For a fix: what the game does wrong, and why the correction takes the form it does rather than the one a reader would reach for first.
- Where an offset, signature, RVA or struct layout was derived from, so it can be checked instead of re-derived.
- What a decision rests on. If that is a measurement, name it. If it is an assumption, say so, and say what would break it.

Write in the present tense about what the code does now. Do not narrate the repository's history; git holds that, and a comment about what used to be there reads as current the moment someone skims it. The one exception is code deliberately removed that a reader would otherwise put back: say what went and why, once, at the place they would reintroduce it.

When changing existing code, change the comments the change makes wrong and leave the rest alone. A fix is not an invitation to rewrite the commentary around it, and a diff that reworks neighbouring prose hides what actually changed.

### How much a comment says

The everyday style is already right: half of all comment blocks are three lines and nine in ten are ten lines or under. What follows is about the few that carry an essay.

**One explanation, one place.** A mechanism is explained in the header of the file that implements it. Everywhere else names it and stops. When a passage explains a mechanism and then says "See `supersample.h`", the text above the pointer is a second copy: keep the pointer and delete the copy. Before deleting, check the fact really does exist at the destination, and move it there when it does not.

**A comment answers what a reader asks where it sits.** At the capability matrix a reader asks what the table is, how to read a cell, and what to do when adding a row. They do not ask how supersampling identifies the composite. Explaining another file's mechanism is the sign that the text is in the wrong file.

**A file header is different, and may be long.** The code is the technical record, so the header of the file that owns a fix carries what a separate document would: the defect, the correction, why it takes that shape, and the measurement that settled it. `src/core/sharpen.h` is the model.

**Where that header goes: the `.h`, whenever the file has one.** A reader looking for what a fix is and why it takes its shape opens the header and finds it there every time, without having to guess which of the pair holds it. A `.cpp` that has a `.h` beside it does not open with an essay.

**What is left in the `.cpp` is what cannot live anywhere else.** A comment whose meaning comes from its position: why this branch is written the way it is, where this offset was read from, what an earlier attempt did at this exact line and why it broke. These are the bulk of the commentary and they are not surplus. Do not move them into a header, where they lose the thing that makes them mean anything, and do not delete them to make a file look tidier.

**Do not trim by the ruler.** Length finds candidates. It does not judge them. A long block that is entirely about the thing its file implements is doing its job.

## Attribution and documentation

Philip Rebohle created the original `atelier-sync-fix` synchronization implementation. TellowKrinkle supplied the earlier Map/Unmap coherence work and the old-Arland resolution correction. Yuri Hime's Atelier Graphics Tweak and the linked Steam investigations are prior work identifying the broad font-atlas transfer problem; AGT's unsafe upload-suppression implementation is not included. Nico, the author of this repository, led the Arland menu-hitch investigation, the `.PSSG` and bounded atlas-read cache research, and the launcher analysis. MinHook is by Tsuda Kageyu and contributors.

Maintain these distinctions in source comments, `README.md`, and `LICENSE`. Do not imply that the menu investigation created the original synchronization technique.

Documentation must describe the current repository state. Do not narrate it using a specific release or version number, and do not hard-wrap Markdown prose.

Avoid overusing em-dashes in source comments and documentation. Prefer commas, parentheses, or separate sentences; occasional correct use is fine, but do not lean on them.

**The code is the technical record.** There is no prose document describing how the fixes work, and adding one is not the default answer to "this needs explaining". A fix's header explains what the defect is, what the correction does, and why it takes that shape; the evidence that settled it belongs there too, next to the thing it justifies. A reader who opens `src/core/sharpen.h` should not need anything else to understand the pass.

The earlier `TECHNICAL.md` is why. It grew to 913 lines that nothing verified, and by the time it was removed it still carried a section for a borderless-window feature that no longer existed. A description of the code that lives away from the code goes stale silently, and nothing in a build can tell you it has.

That places a real obligation on comments. They carry what a separate document would have carried, so they are written for someone who can program but does not know this engine, and they record the reasoning rather than restating the code. A measurement that decided a design goes in the header that design lives in.
