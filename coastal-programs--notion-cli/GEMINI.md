# notion-cli

Unofficial CLI for the Notion API (`@coastal-programs/notion-cli`), optimized for AI agents and automation. Built in Go with Cobra, distributed as a single binary via npm.

## Quick Reference

```bash
make build             # Build Go binary to build/notion-cli
make test              # Run Go test suite
make lint              # go vet + golangci-lint
make release           # Cross-compile for all platforms
make fmt               # Format Go code
make tidy              # go mod tidy
```

## Code Patterns (Always Follow)

- All commands use Cobra; register via `Register*Commands(root *cobra.Command)`
- Use `pkg/output.Printer` for all output, never `fmt.Println` directly
- Use `internal/errors.NotionCLIError` for errors, never raw errors
- Use envelope format for JSON output: `{success, data, metadata}`
- Use `internal/resolver.ExtractID()` for all ID/URL inputs
- Use `context.Context` for all API calls

## Git Workflow

- Conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `test:`, `docs:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`
- Feature branches: `git checkout -b feature/description`
- PRs required for all changes to main
- Never force push to main

## Before Completing Any Task

1. All tests pass: `make test`
2. Build succeeds: `make build`
3. Lint passes: `make lint`
4. CHANGELOG.md updated with changes

## Key Dependencies

- `github.com/spf13/cobra` (CLI framework)
- No Notion SDK - raw HTTP client
- Standard library only for everything else

## Architecture Notes

- **Caching**: In-memory TTL cache. TTLs by resource type (blocks: 30s, pages: 1min, users: 1hr, databases: 10min)
- **Retry**: Exponential backoff with jitter for 408/429/5xx
- **HTTP**: Raw net/http client with gzip support
- **Distribution**: npm wrapper package with platform-specific binary packages (esbuild pattern)

## Environment

```bash
NOTION_TOKEN=secret_...  # Required for all API calls
```

## Eyes

Perception probes live in `.gg/eyes/`. All headless. Artifacts → `.gg/eyes/out/` (gitignored). Invoke probes yourself; don't ask the user to verify what you can verify.

### Available probes

| Need | Run | Then |
|---|---|---|
| Hit any HTTP endpoint (Notion API, local server, webhook URL) and capture status + body | `.gg/eyes/http.sh <url> [METHOD] [body-or-@file] [-H "K: V"]` | Read the `body` path from the JSON result; status + size + time_ms tell you fast whether to drill in. Auth/cookie headers are auto-redacted. |
| Tail a log file or process output (CLI run, build, server) | `.gg/eyes/logs.sh <file-or-cmd>` | Grep the captured artifact under `.gg/eyes/out/` for the error/event you expect. |

### When to use these eyes (automatically, without being asked)

Reach for probes ON YOUR OWN INITIATIVE when any of these apply:

- **After changing anything in `internal/notion/client.go` or any `cmd` that calls the Notion API** (`internal/cli/commands/db.go`, `page.go`, `block.go`, `user.go`, `search.go`): build with `make build`, then exercise the affected command and pipe its output to `.gg/eyes/logs.sh` to confirm the request shape and response handling. Do not assume — verify against the live API with `NOTION_TOKEN` set.
- **When debugging a Notion API error** (4xx/5xx, malformed response, unexpected envelope): hit the endpoint directly with `.gg/eyes/http.sh "https://api.notion.com/v1/<path>" GET '' -H "Authorization: Bearer $NOTION_TOKEN" -H "Notion-Version: 2022-06-28"` to isolate whether the bug is in our client or upstream.
- **After editing `internal/retry/retry.go`, `internal/cache/*.go`, or `pkg/output/*.go`**: run `make test` and tail the output via `.gg/eyes/logs.sh` — these are cross-cutting and silent failures here corrupt every command.
- **After editing `internal/resolver/resolver.go`**: run the affected command against a real Notion URL/ID/name and capture stdout with `.gg/eyes/logs.sh` to confirm the resolution path.
- **When a `make build` or `make test` fails and the output is long**: redirect into `.gg/eyes/logs.sh` so you can grep the artifact instead of re-running.

If a probe fails or returns unexpected results, investigate the artifact directly under `.gg/eyes/out/` before assuming the probe itself is broken.

### When NOT to use

- Docs-only changes (README, CHANGELOG, `docs/`), comments, formatting, `go fmt`.
- Pure refactors fully covered by `make test`.
- `NOTION_TOKEN` isn't set AND the task doesn't need live API verification — say so, don't fake it.
- Same probe already ran this turn against the same URL/file — reuse the artifact path.

### When to escalate a capability gap (the self-improvement loop)

If you're about to **guess**, **skip verification**, or **hand-wave** about something a better probe would show you — STOP and surface the tradeoff inline. Phrasing like:

> "I need to inspect a multipart upload request body but `http.sh` only does simple bodies — and there's no `request_capture` probe. Two paths: (a) ~3 min to add one, then I can diagnose properly. (b) Workaround: I'd reason from the curl `-v` output. Your call?"

Wait for the user's choice. **Don't escalate more than once per request** — if the user picked the workaround, don't re-ask in the same turn.

For minor friction (worked around it but wished it were better), don't interrupt — log it for later review:
- `ggcoder eyes log rough "<reason>" [--probe <name>]` — minor friction, you handled it
- `ggcoder eyes log wish "<gap>"` — capability you wished existed
- `ggcoder eyes log blocked "<reason>"` — call this AFTER the user approves an inline-escalation fix, for the audit trail

These accumulate quietly. The user reviews them periodically. Open signals will appear in your context on future turns until they're acked.
