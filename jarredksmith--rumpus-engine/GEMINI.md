# RUMPUS ENGINE (formerly BREACH) — project guide for Claude Code

RUMPUS ENGINE is a **single-file browser game studio** — build worlds, play them (FPS,
racing, top-down, side-scroll), share them. Everything ships in one file, `breach.html`
(~30,000 lines). It uses three.js **r149** (UMD global: `const THREE = window.THREE`),
the Rapier physics engine, and PeerJS/WebRTC for multiplayer. There is **no build step** —
you open `breach.html` directly in a browser.

The author is Jarred Smith. The goal is a public release.

## Branding (build 952 rebrand)

The **visible name** is RUMPUS ENGINE; the **compatibility identifiers** deliberately keep
the old name — do NOT "clean these up":
- `breach.html` / `breach-help.html` filenames = live GitHub Pages URLs.
- `breach_*` localStorage keys = players' existing saves and settings.
- Share codes: new exports emit `RUMPUSLVL:` and download as `.rumpus`, but `BREACHLVL:`
  codes and `.breach` files must import forever, and the publish Action accepts both prefixes.
- Repo/community URLs still say `jarredksmith/breach` unless the repo itself is renamed
  (a user decision — it changes the Pages URL and would need a follow-up build).

## Repository layout

```
breach.html          # the entire game — the one source of truth
CLAUDE.md            # this file
server/              # self-hosted PHP backend pieces (deployed manually to the cPanel host)
  api/lobbies.php    # live lobby directory (build 956) — flat-file, no DB; see server/README.md
tests/               # Node test suite (unzipped from breach-tests.zip)
  run-all.mjs        # runs every test-*.mjs and prints "N/N harnesses passed"
  harness.mjs        # exports gameSource(), html, extractFunction, extractConst, assert, eq, near, done
  boot-harness.mjs   # support for the boot test
  test-*.mjs         # ~470 numbered tests
  package.json
```

The harness reads the game via `path.resolve(__dirname, '..', 'breach.html')`, so
**`breach.html` must sit one directory above `tests/`** (i.e. at the repo root). Keep it there.

## The build workflow (follow this exactly)

Work in **one feature per build**. Each build is a tight loop:

1. **Re-grep / re-read the exact text before every edit.** Line numbers shift after each
   edit, so never trust a line number from a previous step — search for the literal code again.
2. Make the change.
3. **Syntax check**, then run the **boot test** (it actually executes the game source and
   catches runtime/TDZ errors), then the **full suite**:
   ```
   cd tests
   node test-202-boot.mjs          # executes the source — run after risky edits
   node run-all.mjs                # expect "N/N harnesses passed"
   ```
4. **Update any stale test pins.** Most builds that change a pinned code shape will break
   1–6 source-pin tests — this is expected. Update the regex to match the new code while
   preserving the assertion's intent.
5. **Add a numbered test** for the new feature. Prefer an *executable* test (extract the
   function with `extractFunction(...)`, run it via `new Function(...)` with stubs) over a
   source-pin where practical. Source-pins are fine for UI/wiring.
6. **Bump the build version** near the top of `breach.html`:
   `const BUILD_VERSION = 'build N · <date>';`
7. Commit (see Git below).

### Test conventions
- `.mjs` test files use JS regex literals with **single** backslashes.
- `harness.mjs` exports: `gameSource()` (the largest `<script>` — the game code, not the
  HTML markup), `html` (the full HTML incl. CSS — use for CSS/markup pins), `extractFunction`,
  `extractConst`, `assert`, `eq`, `near`, `done`.
- `extractFunction`'s brace-matcher breaks on functions that contain `{`/`}` **inside string
  literals** — pin those against the raw source instead.
- Some older test files don't import `eq`/`near`/`extractFunction`; add them to the import
  line if you use them.

### Recurring traps
- A `str_replace`/edit whose anchor is a function header must **re-include the header** in
  the replacement.
- After any edit, earlier views are stale — re-read before the next edit.
- When editing test-pin regexes that contain `|` or `\`, prefer a literal string `.replace()`
  in a small script over `sed` (sed escaping is error-prone here).

## Key engine APIs (orientation, not exhaustive)
- **Render pipeline:** `renderScene(scn, cam)` chooses post-FX (`_renderPostFX`) then DoF
  (`_runDofTo`); DoF composes *into* the post pipeline so focus blur survives effects.
- **Cinematics:** `cineCfg`, shots carry `path, lensFrom/To, focusOn, focusFrom/To, dur, look,
  interp, dofRange, dofStrength(+To), roll/rollTo, ease, holdStart/holdEnd`. Threaded through
  `_resShot / _normCineShot / _newCineShot / _newCutscene / _applyCine / serialize`.
  `updateCinematic` drives playback; `_cineEase(t, mode)` is the per-shot motion curve.
  Editor camera-preview window: `_renderCinePvWindow / _cinePvFrameAt / _renderPvDof`.
- **Pickups:** `pickupSpots {x,z,kind,item,y,rx,ry,rz,scale,interact}`, `buildPowerupMesh`,
  `updatePowerups`, `grantPowerup`, `_spawnFloorAt` (ceiling-aware spawn floor).
- **Inventory:** `invCatalog` (per-item def incl. its own `model` + `useType/useKey/useAmount/
  useConsume`), `inventory`, `defineItem/giveItem/takeItem/useItem`, `renderInventory/openInspect`,
  authoring in `renderInvItems`.
- **Multiplayer:** `NET {mode,myId,conns,phase,...}`, host/client message handlers, lobby
  keepalive (`startLobbyKeepalive`), co-op kill credit (`_coopKillFor`, `{t:'frag'}`).
- **Sharing:** `serializeLevel`, `.json` export/import (level + campaign), URL share links
  (`encodeLevel / buildShareLink`, decoded from `#lvl=` on load), challenge links.

## What only a human can verify
The Node harness can't see rendering or run a real session. A browser pass is still required
for: textures, AI scene builder, post-FX + motion blur, the DoF-with-effects path, cinematic
roll/ease/hold/DoF and the live camera-preview window, inventory panel + 3D inspector, pickup
transforms, interact-to-pickup, and real two-machine multiplayer. Asset licensing + a credits
screen are release blockers.

## Git
Initialize a repo and commit each build so you get a clean history (the build number is a
natural commit message, e.g. "build 619 — UGC cloud gallery"). Tag releases as they happen.

## The level generator (`tools/levelgen.mjs`) — orientation

One file, TWO homes: the Node CLI, and the browser (editor → Tools → **Generate arena…**), which
fetches this exact source and evaluates it in a worker behind `RUMPUS_LEVELGEN_HOST` (a Buffer
work-alike + fflate for deflate). Keep it dual-environment — never add a bare `node:` import.

- `node tools/levelgen.mjs <keep|spine|museum|castle|caldera> <out.glb>`
- `node tools/levelgen.mjs arena <out.glb> [seed] [theme|auto] [small|medium|large] [square|cross|octagon|diagonal|auto]`
  themes: industrial | castle | volcanic | garden | desert | frost | facility
- `node tools/levelgen.mjs tex <libid> <out.png>` — fast single-texture iteration
- Env knobs: `TEXSIZE` (texture res), `TEXAUX` (aux-map divisor), `NOTEX/NOMR/NONRM/NOLM` (bisection)

Conventions that are easy to break:
- **Nothing flush.** Decoration stands off structure by `PROUD` (5 cm) and rings are mitred. Two
  coplanar front-facing surfaces z-fight and flash as the camera moves. `test-1108` sweeps all seven
  themes for this and will catch it.
- **`nocollide*`** named nodes are decoration (grass): engine build 1093 skips them in every
  collider and neutralises their raycast; 1096 also stops them receiving shadows.
- **Interiors need `addLight`.** The bake integrates sky visibility + one sun bounce, so anything
  under a roof bakes black without a registered light. Light range is capped at the tracer's search
  distance (9.5) or the shadow test can't see occluders and light leaks through walls.
- **Author to the collider, not to the eye (build 1113, relaxed by 1148).** The engine used to turn an
  imported model into a ~1-unit COLUMN grid where a column went solid for its whole width as soon as a
  triangle touched it: a 0.45-thick wall collided 2.0 thick and a 1.6 m doorway had ZERO passable gap.
  Hence `GRID_PAD` / `BOT_R` / `BOT_LANE` (3.8) in levelgen: **anything a bot must walk through is at
  least BOT_LANE wide**, doorways included. Build 1148 made the collider tight to the triangles (that
  wall now collides 0.500, that doorway passes 1.49 m), so these are a MARGIN rather than a
  requirement — but they are unchanged, because narrowing them is a generator change that needs its
  own probe pass, not a side effect of an engine build.
- **Decoration waits its turn.** Wall-foot pieces are proposed via `later(...)` during the perimeter
  dressing and dropped after everything has reserved its ground; placing them immediately drops a
  boulder onto a gallery ramp. Mirrored cover tests BOTH copies against the reserved rects.
- **Probe before shipping geometry.** Ramps and stairs must read no pushes in the engine probe, not
  just look right. `tests/test-1113-stairs-bot-clearance.mjs` is the durable version of that probe:
  it builds geometry, runs breach.html's own `buildModelGridBoxes` over the triangles, replays the
  enemy obstacle resolution, and flood-fills to prove a bot reaches the roof. For ad-hoc work on a
  whole `.glb`, rebuild a scratchpad `probe-gen.mjs` the same way (parse the GLB, same two steps).

## Rendering: the colour pipeline (build 1115)

The frame is sRGB-encoded exactly once, at the end. Two things make that non-obvious:

- `renderer.outputEncoding = THREE.sRGBEncoding` only covers three's BUILT-IN materials. The post
  chain is raw `ShaderMaterial`s writing `gl_FragColor`, which `<encodings_fragment>` never touches,
  so the pass that writes the CANVAS applies the OETF itself via the shared `_OETF_GLSL` snippet and
  a `uEncode` uniform. Three passes can be last (DoF present, composite, afterimage copy) and each
  sets `uEncode` per frame. **Encode an intermediate target and the next pass blurs and grades
  gamma-encoded values** — that is the bug this design exists to prevent.
- `ColorManagement.legacyMode = false` linearises every hex colour on the way in, INCLUDING light
  colours. A saturated dark light colour loses most of its luminance (`0x4a6c7a` keeps ~34%), so
  intensities tuned before this change now read dim. Albedo moves the same way, and that is the
  stock level's real limiter: `floorColor 0x141c22` linearises to 0.0089.

Do NOT scale `lightMapIntensity` by PI. r149 already does it on upload
(`lightMapIntensity.value = material.lightMapIntensity * (physicallyCorrectLights !== true ? PI : 1)`).
An audit claimed otherwise from r13x-era reasoning; the double multiply blew the bake out 3.14x and
was caught only by capturing the frame and measuring it.

Levels carry `world.colorV`. Absent = authored before this build = rendered through `LEGACY_EXPOSURE`,
because correct rendering makes old content brighter than its author ever saw. `_worldFrom()` is the
only place that decides it — a legacy level must not inherit the default's `colorV:2` through an
`Object.assign`.

## Post-processing: the AO prepass (build 1126)

SSAO needs depth, and r149 **cannot** attach a depth texture to a multisampled target — which is
where build 872's 4× MSAA lives, the only antialiasing the engine has. Trading MSAA for FXAA was
tried and **measured**: on a pillar edge against the sky, MSAA gives a 1.02-pixel coverage gradient
on 100 of 100 scanlines; FXAA in its place left a hard edge on 94 of 99. So AO gets its own half-res
G-buffer prepass (`_aoGeoRT`, view normal in rgb + view distance in a) written with
`scene.overrideMaterial`, and MSAA stays. FXAA survives only on the DoF path, which was never
multisampled anyway. `tests/test-1126` and `scratchpad/edgeq.mjs` are the durable versions of that
measurement.

Three traps in that prepass, all of which shipped broken once:
- **"nothing drawn here" must be geometric, not a magic depth value.** The clear leaves the target's
  alpha near zero but *not* zero, so `a <= 1e-4` let every sky pixel through and AO shaded the whole
  upper half of the frame dark grey. A packed normal's channels sum to ≥ 0.63 for any unit vector and
  to ~0 when cleared — test that.
- `overrideMaterial` replaces `depthWrite:false` too, so the **sky dome fills the buffer** unless it
  is hidden for the pass. Weather points do the same.
- The prepass must run **after** the main scene pass or it consumes the frame's shadow-map refresh.

`_msaaOn`/`_msaaFails` are now `_hiFxOn`/`_hiFxFails`: build 883's ladder rung is unchanged, but it
carries MSAA *and* SSAO. `wipeScene` → `_postOffWorld` zeroes `ssao` along with the other post
settings — which silently disabled AO in every capture until `arenaMood` started emitting `ssao`.

## The sky (build 1127) — three traps

- `_skyEnv()` had returned `_skyEnvRT.texture` since build 1119: the HDRI path's target, declared
  7,300 lines below, so at boot it was a **TDZ ReferenceError** swallowed by the surrounding catch.
  The procedural sky lit nothing for eight builds and nothing said so. If a `catch(e){ return null; }`
  guards something whose absence is invisible, that absence needs a test.
- **A raw `ShaderMaterial` gets neither ACES nor `outputEncoding`** — three injects both only into its
  own material programs. `_ACES_GLSL` (beside `_OETF_GLSL`) is three's verbatim fit, written out
  because `#include <tonemapping_fragment>` cannot work here: the program prefix defines
  `toneMapping()` as a wrapper calling `ACESFilmicToneMapping`, which the chunk declares *after* the
  prefix, so the call is a forward reference and the program fails to compile — silently, and the mesh
  vanishes. The water shader is the remaining surface with this problem.
- **`typeof x` does NOT guard a temporal dead zone.** It throws for an uninitialised `let`. Declaring
  `_skyDayDim` below the `_skyP()` that reads it turned the entire sky black on the first frame.

`_sunDir()` now measures the direction from the light to `_sunTarget` rather than re-deriving it from
`worldCfg` — the day cycle and build 1120's shadow fit both move the light without touching the
config, so a config-derived sun disagreed with the one casting the shadows.

## Two things I got wrong here, twice (build 1136)

Both were plausible hypotheses stated before measuring, and both cost a capture cycle:

1. **"The teal cast is the emissive bleeding through bloom."** The channel signature (G+48, B+50,
   R+14) matched the teal accent, so it looked settled. Cutting the emissive from 1.6 to 0.55 moved
   the measurement by **1 code value**. Comparing a *lit* pixel to its authored albedo hex is not a
   valid comparison in the first place — the pixel is albedo × light, tone-mapped.
2. **"The IBL dominates and is swamping the sun."** Correcting the probe (see below) and scaling it
   by `sky` changed **0.95%** of the frame. Raising the sun 50% and halving the hemisphere fill
   changed **38.6%**. The environment map was never the loud term.

The real answer was arithmetic, not a bug: a shadowed deck measured R/G 0.33, and the albedo's own
R/G (0.58) × the blue sky's (0.51) = 0.30. The renderer was reproducing exactly what it was given.
A monochrome frame with cool albedos under a cool sky is **content**, not code. Warm the architecture
and keep the props cool and the frame gets three notes.

**The environment probe must be RAW RADIANCE.** Build 1127 tone-mapped it "to match what the eye sees
of the same sky" — wrong. Materials multiply the environment against albedo *before* three tone-maps
the shaded result, so ACES was being applied twice. The dome (a final colour) tone-maps and encodes;
the probe (radiance) does neither. `worldCfg.sky` now scales the probe as well as the hemisphere light,
because r149 has no global environment intensity and walking every material on every change is worse.

## Headless capture

The engine renders under Chromium + SwiftShader, so visual changes can be measured, not argued about.
The whole game lives inside `window.GAME_START = function(){...}`, so page-level JS cannot reach its
internals: a harness has to drive the real UI. Capture at a FIXED generator seed or before/after
frames are different arenas and prove nothing.

**Know where the camera is before you judge the frame (build 1124).** Four rounds of visual
critique — "no sky", "contact shadows detached", "flat sunless lighting", "break the arena canopy
lid" — were all one bug: the player spawned at the origin, which is under the generated arena's
central mass, with 0.55 m of headroom. The rust "sky" was the underside of a rock. Nothing was
wrong with the sky, the shadows or the light. When a frame looks inexplicable, probe the scene
before theorising: a temporary `window.__probeUp` hook that raycasts up from `camera.position` and
stuffs the hit list into `document.title` costs one capture run and settles it, because
`page.title()` reaches out of the closure that `page.evaluate` cannot. Zeroing a suspect parameter
to its most extreme value is the other cheap discriminator — `normalBias = 0` producing NO acne
proved the geometry was never in the shadow map, which no amount of bias tuning would have shown.

**Probe the MATERIAL, not just the geometry (build 1139).** The same technique settles "why did my
material change do nothing". A `window.__surfProbe` that raycasts through a few screen points and
reports, per hit, the object's src, its material type and colour, and which of `map`/`normalMap`/
`roughnessMap` are set, found in one run what four rounds of reasoning had not. Two cautions learned
the hard way: filter the sky dome out of the hit list (it is a mesh one unit from the camera and wins
every ray), and remember `Raycaster` ignores a mesh's own `visible:false` but NOT its ancestors' — so
editor gizmo geometry shows up in play. An `InstancedMesh` hit reports the SHARED geometry (a unit box
at the origin) with a correct world hit point; that mismatch is the signature of a batch, not a bug.

## Procedural surface detail (build 1139) — three ways to ship nothing

`_procSurface()` bakes one 256×256 tiling value-noise field into a Sobel `normalMap` and a
`roughnessMap`; `applyProcSurface(mat, span)` / `retileProcSurface(root, span)` hand it to `floorMat`,
`wallMat` and every `primitiveMat()`. Each of the three faults below produced a frame that measured
IDENTICAL to the one before it, so none would have been caught by looking.

- **A map assigned at material construction is not a map.** `worldCfg.floorTex` is `''` by default, so
  the first `applyWorldCfg` ran `_loadSurfaceMap`'s no-url branch and wrote `null` over `floorMat.map`
  before the first frame. The detail set is therefore a REMEMBERED FALLBACK (`mat.userData.procSurf`,
  read by `_procFallback`) that every clear path restores. Anything that writes `mat[slot] = null`
  needs to go through it.
- **UV tiling is not a physical size.** The box primitive is a unit cube, so one repeat value gives an
  11 m blotch on a 22 m deck and a 50 cm one on a 1 m crate — the same material reading as two
  differently-zoomed photographs. Callers pass a world SPAN; `_procRepeatFor` quantises `span /
  PROC_TILE_M` onto `_PROC_STEPS` so the clone cache stays ~7 entries.
- **`buildInstancing()` rebuilt the batch material from scratch.** It grouped by `shape|colour` and
  constructed a fresh `MeshStandardMaterial` at the default roughness .65 / metalness .35 — so every
  instanced prop lost the detail set in play and got it back in the editor, and had been silently
  losing its authored *shine* and *opacity* the same way since long before this build. It now clones a
  real member's material and `_instKey` carries colour, shine, opacity and grain scale.

**An albedo `map` cannot be exposure-neutral.** It multiplies the material colour, so it only darkens:
a near-white 226..255 field averages 0.87 in LINEAR space and measured −19% across the frame (a deck
91,105,90 → 74,91,68). Neutrality would need values above 255. Since this retrofits detail onto colours
creators already chose, the set carries relief and roughness only — `PROC_SLOTS`. Relief is also baked
into the map rather than set as `material.normalScale`, because `floorMat`/`wallMat` are shared and a
creator's own normal map would inherit whatever scale was left behind. `STR` was 2.6, then 1.8, and both
read as crumpled foil with grazing-angle moiré; the Sobel sums eight taps of a unit-amplitude field, so
micro-relief is `STR ≈ 0.3` (steepest slope ~8°).

## The viewmodel is part of the frame (build 1140)

`renderViewmodel()` used to draw straight to the CANVAS from the frame loop, *after* `renderScene` had
finished — so the one object on screen at all times, across 11% of it, was the only object outside the
frame's look: no bloom on its muzzle flash or its metal, no vignette, no grain, its own colour response.
It was also absent from the SSAO G-buffer, so the AO term at its pixels came from the WORLD BEHIND IT and
was then multiplied into it — the weapon wore the shading of whatever it stood in front of and had no
occlusion of its own anywhere.

It is now three functions: `_vmWanted()` (the predicate, asked by both callers), `_drawViewmodel()`
(draws into **whatever target is bound** — the caller owns it), and `renderViewmodel()` (the frame loop's
straight-to-canvas call, a no-op when `_vmDone`). `_renderPostFX` binds `_postRT` and draws the weapon
after the scene and after DoF (a first-person weapon stays sharp) and before bloom, then renders `vmScene`
with `_matAOGeo` into `_aoGeoRT` inside the existing `_aoWant` gate, so the extra pass disappears with AO.
That last part only works because `vmCam` tracks the main camera's fov/aspect and the G-buffer stores a
raw view distance — if either changes, the weapon's AO silently goes wrong.

**The default level had NO post-processing at all.** `if(!(savedLevel && savedLevel.world))
_postOffWorld(worldCfg)` — build 796 — zeroed bloom, motion blur, vignette, grain, the grade and `ssao`
for a first-time scene. Probed on the stock frame: `bloom=0 vig=0 aoAmt=0`. That was right when the
first-time scene was 22 boxes at `Math.random()` positions; from build 1133 it is a designed level, so
every visual system builds 1126, 1128, 1135 and 1136 added was switched off in the first frame anybody
ever sees — and *unmeasurable there*, which is why those builds were all measured on generated arenas.
An EMPTY scene still starts clean: `_wipeSceneCore` keeps calling `_postOffWorld`, and that is where 796's
actual intent lives.

Measured, stock level, same camera: weapon body 2,473 → 5,837 unique colours; weapon grip mean
72,81,71 → 56,65,56; frame corner 70,74,62 → 57,59,50 (the vignette); crate foot 109,143,139 → 97,133,128
(world AO). A/B on the G-buffer pass alone, everything else in place: weapon grip 69,80,67 → 56,65,56
while the crate foot stays byte-identical — so the weapon's occlusion is its own, not the vignette's.

## The adaptive quality ladder (build 1141) — it never fired when it mattered

`_adaptResTick` opened with `if(_adaptN < 8){ _adaptAcc=0; _adaptN=0; return; }` — "need a real sample".
Eight frames inside a 500 ms window **is 16 fps**, so on anything slower the gate was never satisfied: it
threw its evidence away and returned every window, forever. The worse the device, the more certainly the
relief never arrived, which is the exact inverse of what the system is for. Measured by driving the real
function with steady synthetic frame times for 60 s of simulated play: 22–70 ms/frame reached the bottom
rung; **100, 150, 200 and 400 ms/frame never moved at all.**

"A real sample" is now a quantity of TIME (`ADAPT_MIN_SAMPLE_MS`, with a two-frame floor), and a deficient
window KEEPS its samples instead of discarding them, so even a machine slower than one frame per window
eventually has two.

Fixing that exposed a second flaw that had always been live at normal frame rates: a window's **mean** is
dominated by one pathological frame, so a single 3-second hitch — a level load, a GC pause, a shader
compile — cost the player a rung for a load that was never sustained. So a frame contributes at most
`ADAPT_FRAME_CAP` to the mean, and both downshift rungs now require `slowFrac >= 0.5` (a majority-slow
window) beside the mean. The CLIMB is deliberately *not* gated on `slowFrac` — recovering means the mean
came down, which is the right question there.

`tests/test-1141` executes all of it: every sustained load from 22 ms to 900 ms reaches the bottom rung,
8–20 ms is left alone, hitches of 300 ms to 12 s cost nothing, recovery climbs all the way back, and the
opt-out still holds. `scratchpad/ladder2.mjs` is the sweep that found it — worth rebuilding rather than
reasoning, because the failure is invisible from the code and needs no browser to reproduce.

## The loudest light in the engine was a decoration (build 1142)

The default level's floor rendered olive-green — (87,105,77) against an albedo `0x4f5d66` that is
(79,93,102), i.e. the blue channel HIGHEST in the albedo and LOWEST in the frame, which no positive light
times that albedo produces. Recorded in the 1139 open work as needing the zero-one-term method. What
actually settled it in ONE run was **enumerating the scene's real light list**: 29 lights, four of them
`PointLight(0x38f5b5, 8, 22)` from `buildPillar` — intensity 8 against a sun of 1.5, in a teal whose
linear channels are R 0.028, G 0.745, B 0.434, and four of them stand around the spawn. The frame's key
light was a decoration.

A/B with those four lights zeroed and nothing else changed: mid floor 56,101,101 → 55,71,83 (B>G>R
restored), near deck 81,101,70 → 78,66,51 (warm concrete finally warm), crate 116,149,146 → 115,125,132.
They also carried most of the frame's *variation* (4,027 → 1,074 unique colours), so the answer is accent
strength, not zero: **4.0 at 18 m** is the most light that leaves the frame's hue albedo-correct while
still laying a real pool at the pillar's own foot (G +20 over unlit, 722 → 1,370 unique colours there).

Two things worth carrying forward:

- **When the key light changes, every fill and accent tuned against the old one is now wrong.** This light
  was correct for the dark greybox it was written for; build 1135 raised the sun to 1.5 and gave the level
  a daylight sky and nobody revisited it. Build 1135 had in fact chased the same teal cast and cut the
  accent's *emissive* from 1.6 to 0.55, measuring only 1 code value of change — because the emissive was
  never the emitter. The light beside it was.
- **Probe the LIGHT LIST, not just the material.** Builds 1124 (`__probeUp`) and 1139 (`__surfProbe`)
  established probing geometry and materials; a `__floorProbe` that dumps every light's type, hex,
  intensity and range, grouped, plus the material's linear albedo, answered in one run what two builds of
  reasoning had not. `test-1142` turns it into a standing guard: no hardcoded light may be both
  far-reaching and more than 3× the sun.

The station beacon `PointLight(0x38c8f5, 6, 14)` was the obvious second suspect and is **deliberately
unchanged** — dropping it to 2.0/12 moved the dais by 4 code values and the floor by none. Its 14 m range
confines it to the landmark it marks. Measured, not assumed, and recorded so it is not "tidied up" later.

## Themes describe the ground too (build 1143)

`arenaMood` set sky, fog, post and `ssao` but never `floorColor` or `wallColor`, so the ENGINE's own
ground plane and boundary walls stayed at `DEFAULT_WORLD`'s cool grey-blue in every generated level. That
is directly visible, because the imported ground stops at ±W and the engine's plane runs on to ±ARENA:
measured on the desert arena, the plane read (103,114,87) — olive, G highest — butting against sand at
(185,173,139). It now reads (100,94,74), R>G>B, the same order as the ground beside it, and the imported
ground is unchanged.

`groundMood(gnd, rough, metal)` sits beside `skyMood` and takes the theme's **`light.groundAlb`** — the
albedo the lightmap bake already integrates for the sun bounce — so the plane the player walks past and
the bounce the bake assumed are the same surface. `wallColor` is that albedo at 55% in linear space: the
same world one value down rather than a different one. `floorColor` therefore equals `skyGround`, which
also removes the horizon seam between the dome's ground band and the real ground.

**Measured in build 1150, and "the same surface" is FALSE.** `groundAlb` is a hand-picked triple; the ground
material actually drawn is `base × texture mean`, and the two disagree in every theme — by 0.35× to 1.59×:

| theme | ground material | drawn albedo (linear) | `groundAlb` | Y ratio |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| industrial | `concrete` ×[.30,.31,.33] | 0.110/0.114/0.117 | 0.20/0.21/0.22 | 0.54× |
| castle | `cobble` | 0.154/0.136/0.113 | 0.22/0.19/0.15 | 0.71× |
| volcanic | `dirt` | 0.142/0.091/0.053 | 0.16/0.13/0.10 | 0.74× |
| garden | `grass` ×[.74,.80,.62] | 0.034/0.067/0.011 | 0.12/0.18/0.08 | **0.35×** |
| desert | `sand` | 0.511/0.372/0.185 | 0.42/0.34/0.22 | 1.11× |
| frost | `snow` | 0.779/0.829/0.899 | 0.60/0.64/0.70 | 1.29× |
| facility | `scifiFloor` | 0.165/0.189/0.222 | 0.10/0.12/0.14 | **1.59×** |

FOUR consumers derived from the abstraction while the renderer drew the texture. **Fixed in build 1151** —
see "The ground albedo is now the ground it draws", where every theme's `gnd` became the drawn value and a
test recomputes all seven from the real palette so the two cannot drift apart again.

Each theme now names `zen` / `hor` / `gnd` **once**. They were written out twice per theme before (in the
`light` block and again inside the `skyMood(...)` call) and this build would have made it three times —
which is exactly how a mood ends up baking against one ground and showing the player another.
`test-1143` counts the literals to keep it that way.

## `envMapIntensity` is the ambient, not a reflection knob (build 1144)

In r149 `getIBLIrradiance` returns `PI * envMapColor.rgb * envMapIntensity` — the **diffuse** ambient. This
engine wrote `envMapIntensity = metalness` in three places ("reflections track the metal slider"), which
is the r13x mental model where envMap was a reflection map you turned up for chrome. In a PBR pipeline the
environment IS the ambient light, so `= metalness` meant **a matte surface received no sky light at all**.
Build 1095 added a default environment so "metals don't render black"; that line then withheld it from
every dielectric.

Removing the gating entirely, measured on the stock level: floor plane 54,79,88 → 85,116,136, crate face
116,133,137 → 143,160,168, warm deck 74,71,54 → 99,100,89, **sky byte-identical**. So the *amount* was
accidentally in the right range and the fault was the coupling. Hence `SKY_ENV_FLOOR = 0.12` and
`_envInten(metal, bright)` — metals keep exactly what they were tuned with, nothing is ever unlit, and the
stock frame is preserved (a crate at metalness 0.35 is byte-identical; the floor moves one code value).
`primitiveMat` had never set the property at all, so a fresh box took three's default 1.0 while any prop
whose shine had been touched got 0.35 — the same object lit two ways depending on whether a slider had
been dragged. Both sites now share the one derivation.

**Be honest about the size of this one:** it is a contained correctness fix, not a visual overhaul. The
0.12 floor only bites at metalness ≈ 0, and at desert noon (sun elevation 72°, N·L ≈ 0.95) the sun swamps
it — the desert plane measures byte-identical before and after, with `env=SET` and `floorEnvI=0.12`
confirmed by probe, so that is the sun dominating, not a missing environment.

Three numbers worth keeping from the investigation, each isolated by capture:
- The engine's ambient is **~80% probe, ~20% hemisphere light**. Zeroing `skyLight` entirely took a
  shadowed floor from 0.105 to 0.0846 linear. `applySky` sets the hemisphere light's two colours from the
  hemispherical average of the *same* `skyRadiance` model the probe renders, so they are two integrations
  of one sky — a genuine double count, just a small one.
- Sun-to-shade on the stock level is **3.3:1 linear** as shipped, which is the low end of real daylight.
  Ungating the environment to 1.0 takes it to 1.58:1, which reads flat.
- For a strictly physical balance the sun is roughly **4× too weak** relative to the sky (real daylight is
  ~8:1 on a horizontal surface). Fixing that is a whole-engine rebalance with a legacy-content story like
  `colorV`'s, not a one-line change — do not start it without that plan.

## Object-space detail for UV-less models (build 1145)

Build 1139's detail set needs texture coordinates. **The shipped weapon has none** — read out of gun.glb,
every primitive carries only `NORMAL` and `POSITION`, and its four materials all sit at the identical
roughness 0.415087 / metalness 0.4 with no maps of any kind. That is the whole of the critic's "not one
specular pixel" on the object filling 11% of every frame, and no texture can fix it: with no UVs there is
nowhere to put one. The low-poly sources this engine points creators at ship UV-less meshes constantly.

So `applyObjDetail` patches three's own `MeshStandardMaterial` through `onBeforeCompile` — the technique
`floorMat` already uses for the paint splat, and deliberately **not** a raw `ShaderMaterial` (this file has
twice lost a subsystem to a raw shader failing to compile silently; a patched built-in keeps three's
lighting, shadows, fog and tone mapping intact). Four things in it are load-bearing:

- **Object space, not world space.** A viewmodel bobs and a prop can be carried; world-space noise makes
  the grain SWIM across the surface as the object moves. `vOdPos = position`.
- **Frequency is CYCLES ACROSS THE MESH, never per unit.** A GLB arrives in whatever units its author
  used — gun.glb, the museum and a Poly Pizza crate differ by orders of magnitude — so a per-unit figure is
  invisible on one asset and aliased to noise on the next. `_objDetailFreq` normalises by each mesh's own
  local bounding box.
- **The roughness patch runs BEFORE the normal patch**, because three emits `roughnessmap_fragment` before
  `normal_fragment_maps`, so the field is evaluated once into shader globals and the normal patch
  differences against it — four noise evaluations per pixel instead of five. `test-1145` verifies that
  ordering **against the real three build** (`ShaderLib.physical.fragmentShader`), because if an upgrade
  reorders them `_odBase` is read before it is written and the perturbation silently becomes garbage.
- **`customProgramCacheKey` is a constant.** Every patched material produces the same program; without it
  three compiles a variant per material.

An authored map of any kind (`map` / `normalMap` / `roughnessMap` / `metalnessMap`) or the presence of UVs
disqualifies a material — a creator's asset always wins, and two detail systems on one surface is double
grain. The gradient is projected onto the tangent plane so the perturbation cannot rotate a normal off its
own surface, and roughness is a bounded *multiplier* of the authored value.

Measured on the weapon's receiver panel: 4,782 → 5,378 unique colours, mean held at 92,102,108 → 92,102,109,
world away from the weapon unchanged at 132,141,147. Expect a few percent of run-to-run spread in any
unique-colour measurement — `postGrain` is stochastic per frame.

## The gizmo snaps (build 1146)

The transform gizmo moved, rotated and scaled in raw continuous mouse units. Nothing in the product could
put two crates on one lattice, sit a wall flush against another, or turn a prop exactly 90 degrees — except
the numeric fields, at five decimal places, one axis at a time. Build 929's `buildSnap` is a *different*
feature and is untouched: that snaps the PLACEMENT of a new block against the face you aim at; this snaps
the TRANSFORM of something already in the scene.

Four decisions, each of which could reasonably have gone the other way:
- **A single object snaps its resulting POSITION** to the world lattice, so two crates placed in separate
  drags land on the same grid. `_snapAlong` snaps only the component along the drag axis — snapping the
  whole vector would drag the two axes the creator is *not* touching onto the grid, so an object
  deliberately placed off-lattice would jump the moment any axis was nudged.
- **A group snaps the DISTANCE MOVED.** Snapping each member absolutely pulls a deliberate arrangement
  apart — two crates 1.2 apart become 1.0 or 1.5 apart. The delta keeps the cluster rigid.
- **Scale snaps the SIZE, not the factor.** A box primitive's scale *is* its size in metres, so what a
  creator wants is a wall exactly 3.0 wide; the factor is derived back out of the snapped size, which keeps
  proportional scaling proportional while landing the dragged axis on a round number. The all-axes handle
  and a group scale have no single size to land, so there the factor is what snaps.
- **Rotate snaps the ANGLE TURNED**, before the quaternion is built. Decomposing an orientation back out of
  a quaternion is ambiguous, and "a quarter turn from here" is what the handle is for. 15° divides 90 and 360.

`Ctrl`/`Cmd` **inverts** rather than enables: with snapping on (the default) the modifier is how you nudge
into a gap, and with it off the modifier is how you grab the lattice for one drag. Both are what a creator
reaches for and one key serves both — but an invisible inverting modifier is a trap, so the checkbox says
so. `Shift` is deliberately not the key: it is already multi-select here. A step of 0 turns snapping off for
that channel only, which the field's tooltip states.

## The scene-asset browser (build 1147)

The editor could search the WEB for models (`renderModelBrowser` — Poly Pizza / Sketchfab) but had no view
of its own content. Every other engine's second-most-used panel is exactly that (Unity's Project window,
Unreal's Content Browser), and without it there is no way to see what a level is built from, to place
another of something already used without searching for it again, or to act on every instance of one asset
at once — a level with 57 props was a numbered list you stepped through one prop at a time.

`sceneAssetList()` groups `propModels` by `userData.src`, excluding primitives (those are the *Add a shape*
row; mixing them in buries the imports among 57 boxes). Ordered most-used first — the thing a level is made
of is the thing you reach for again — then by name for a stable tie-break. `renderSceneAssets` draws a tile
per asset with a live thumbnail, an instance count badge, click-to-add-another, and a `◉` overlay that
selects every copy via build 564's multi-selection and then frames it with build 1137's `_edFrameSelected`
— a browser that selects something off screen is the same "nothing happened" the panel exists to fix.

Three details worth keeping:
- `_renderAssetThumb` shares build 813's offscreen renderer and its LRU cache, keyed by url alone, so
  re-rendering the panel is free after the first paint. It frames by the mesh's largest dimension so a
  Poly Pizza crate and the museum show at the same apparent size whatever units they arrived in, and a
  device where a second WebGL context fails keeps an empty tile rather than breaking the panel.
- The select-all control **stops the event**, or clicking it would also fire the tile's add-another.
- Poly Pizza serves bare UUIDs, so `assetShortName` labels a hex basename as `model · 78846e` rather than
  printing an id as if it were a name. The full name and url live in the tooltip: a three-column grid in a
  344px panel gives a tile ~100px, which is about twelve characters.

Nothing is downloaded and nothing is stored in the level — it is data the engine already held.

## The collider was a cell wider than the model (build 1148)

`buildModelGridBoxes` turns an imported model into a ~1-unit COLUMN grid, and a column went solid for its
whole width as soon as a triangle touched it. Measured on the build-1123 repro — a thin wall with an
ordinary 1.6 m doorway — the passable gap was **0.00 m**: one merged box spanned the opening. A 0.45-thick
wall collided **2.000** thick. That is the root cause behind the generator's `GRID_PAD` / `BOT_LANE`, and
it meant every OTHER creator's imported building was un-walkable unless they had happened to pad it.

Each (column, **slot**) now remembers the real XZ extent of the triangles that stamped it, one byte per
edge (~4 mm at a 1-unit cell). Build 1123 tried this per COLUMN and opened no doorway; the reason is the
load-bearing insight here and it recurs one level down:

- **Per column is not enough**, because a column holds several RUNS and a doorway column holds the floor
  slab (which fills the cell) beside the wall's jamb face (a sliver). Their union is the whole cell.
- **Per slot is not enough either** — a run's footprint is the union over its slots, and a wall's BASE slot
  holds the floor slab too, so the union inherits the slab's full cell. Measured before segmenting: the
  0.2 wall still collided 2.0 and the doorway was still shut. So a run **splits wherever its footprint
  changes**, compared at `FOOT_Q = 16` levels per edge so a few millimetres between slots cannot shatter a
  wall into K boxes.
- **Merging is only lossless while the footprint spans the whole cell on the merge axis.** Two adjacent
  columns each holding a sliver at the same relative position are two thin walls with a gap between them,
  and one merged box bridges it — solid where the model is open, the very fault this build removes. A
  wall's columns are full along its run and thin across it, so the case that matters still collapses.

**Widening a too-thin footprint is where this went wrong twice, and both wrong answers were plausible.**
Zero-thickness geometry (which low-poly levels are full of) would emit a box of no thickness, so a
footprint is widened to `MGRID_MIN_THICK` (0.25) — but toward WHICH side is not a guess:
1. *Centred on the measurement.* A 0.45 wall straddling a cell boundary became two 0.25 slabs at z=±0.25
   with a **walk-through gap at z=0** — a worse failure than the over-solid cell.
2. *Grow to the nearer cell edge.* A 1.4 wall's two faces sit near the outer edges of their cells, so both
   grew **outward, away from each other**, hollowing the wall out.
3. *Ask the occupancy grid.* If the neighbour cell is solid at the same slot the wall continues across that
   boundary, so this cell's footprint must reach it; the two halves then meet and the wall is solid. Solid
   on both sides means the cell is interior and fills. One bit lookup, and it is not a guess.

`PLANE_B` (2/255 of a cell, ~8 mm) is what distinguishes a single SURFACE from a thin measurement: a wall
wholly inside one cell records BOTH its faces, so it is not a plane at all and keeps its measured position,
widening about its own centre — otherwise a 0.2 wall in mid-cell would be dragged out to a cell edge.

**Fail SOLID, never open.** An unstamped slot starts at min 255 / max 0, and a slot that is solid with no
recorded fragment falls back to the whole cell. The budget (`MGRID_FOOT_BYTES`, 24 MB, halved on phones)
degrades per-slot → per-column → none, and *none* is exactly the pre-1148 behaviour rather than a broken
grid: 4 bytes × N × K is ~750 KB for an arena and 24 MB on the 331×148×366 skyscraper this serves.

Measured, doorway repro: **1.6 m opening 0.00 → 1.49 m passable**, 2.56 → 2.49, 3.8 → 3.49. Wall collider
thickness: 0.1 → 0.500, 0.2 → 0.500, **0.45 → 0.500 (was 2.000)**, 0.9 → 0.875, 1.4 → 1.375.

**It costs boxes, and every consumer walks the list per query.** A real 3-storey generated block (16,368
triangles, 45×74×37): **795 boxes / 110 ms → 2,291 / 137 ms**. A `FOOT_Q` sweep of 4/8/16/32 gave
2,240/2,277/2,291/2,321 — so the increase is structural (a tight collider genuinely has more pieces), not
quantisation noise, and tuning `FOOT_Q` will not buy it back. The enemy resolve already rejected a prop on
its overall box before walking its box list; `_surfCull`, `clearAt`, `insideSolid` and `ceilingAt` did not,
and now do. `segmentBlocked` is deliberately left — it walks a SEGMENT, not a point, so it needs a
segment-bbox test rather than the same four comparisons.

Still true, and not introduced here: a hollow shell thicker than two cells has empty interior cells.

## The shade had lost a channel (build 1149)

Measured on the stock level's floor inside a cast shadow, per channel: **R min 0, p50 2, max 6 — with 19%
of the patch at EXACTLY zero and 73% at or below 2** — against G 38 and B 50. That is why the first frame
anybody sees reads as teal murk, and why no grade could recover it: there was nothing left to recover.

The cause is structural, not a tuning slip. A `HemisphereLight` gives an up-facing surface 100% of the SKY
colour and none of the ground colour, and a cosine lobe over a cubemap probe excludes the lower hemisphere
entirely. Both are correct for a bare sky. Both are wrong for a scene with walls and crates standing around
it — a real floor in shade is lit mostly by light bounced off its surroundings, and this engine has no GI to
supply that. So the shade was lit by nothing but blue, times a floor albedo (`0x4f5d66` → linear R 0.078,
B 0.138) that is itself blue-dominant. Red had nowhere to come from.

`bounceLight` is the standard pre-GI stand-in: **one bounce of the SUN off the level's own surfaces.** Four
things about it are deliberate:
- **An `AmbientLight`.** A bounce arrives from every direction, which is the one thing that light models
  correctly. It is also free.
- **Coloured `sunColor × mix(floorColor, wallColor, 0.4)`**, in linear (`setHex` does the transfer on the
  way in). That is redder than the sky by 4× in R:B, which is the whole point — a term with the sky's own
  hue could not have fixed a missing red channel.
- **Scaled by `sun`, and by the day cycle's `dayF`.** A bounce is the key light coming back off a surface,
  so it dies with the key. A flat lift cannot do that, which is why this is a new term rather than a bigger
  default for `ambient` — that one stays the creator's arbitrary white lift, untouched.
- **`0.50` is derived, not chosen.** The albedo is already in the light's colour, so the bounced irradiance
  lands at 7–12% of the sun's on a horizontal surface — what a ~10%-albedo floor actually returns for one
  bounce. Raise a level's floor albedo and its bounce grows with it, correctly and for free.

Swept by capture at 0 / 0.15 / 0.30 / 0.50 — sunlit floor `79,115,117 → 83,120,122` (+4 at the top of the
range), shade `2,38,50 → 9,47,60`, red-at-exactly-zero `19% → 5% → 0% → 0%`, sun-to-shade `9.46:1 → 6.86:1`.
0.30 clears the clip; 0.50 clears it with margin (min 3) for four code values on the lit surface.

**Not gated on `colorV`, unlike build 1115.** That build moved every pixel through a different transfer
curve; this one only ADDS light, and only where there was none. Leaving a clipped channel in every level
that already exists is the worse outcome. The lit-surface delta above is the evidence for that call.

**Two corrections to what was recorded before this build.** Both were derived from scene-linear term
isolation rather than from the frame, and the frame disagrees:
- *"Sun-to-shade on the stock level is 3.3:1 linear as shipped, the low end of real daylight."* Measured
  off the frame on a lit and a shadowed patch of the SAME floor: **9.46:1**. The shadows were never shallow.
- *"For a strictly physical balance the sun is roughly 4× too weak relative to the sky."* Raising the sun
  would have deepened a shadow that was already crushing a channel to zero. The defect was the ambient's
  COLOUR and its lack of a bounce term, not the key light's strength. The whole-engine rebalance that note
  warns against should not be started; there is nothing there to fix.

An analytic model of the light terms said the stock level sat at 3.0:1 and the generated arenas at
1.2–3.3:1. It was wrong in both directions, and one capture settled it. **Model the lights to decide what to
try; measure the frame to decide what is true.**

**The generator states its own value, derived from the same albedo.** The bounce is coloured by the level's
floor, so its delivered fill scales with that floor's brightness — right as physics, wrong as art direction
across seven themes whose grounds span 5:1 in luminance (frost snow Y 0.64 against the facility apron's
0.12). At the engine default the desert's imported sand measured `244,208,160 → 250,218,170`, which is
nearly white. So `groundMood` divides the target fill back out — `0.0535 / lum(groundAlb)`, the engine
default times the stock floor's own luminance — and every theme delivers the same fill to within 12%:
industrial 0.26, castle 0.28, volcanic 0.40, garden 0.33, desert 0.15, frost 0.08, facility 0.46. Named in
ONE place beside the floor and wall colours that come from the same albedo, which is build 1143's lesson.

Measured three ways on the desert arena at seed 4242 — as shipped before, at the engine default, and at the
theme's derived 0.15:
```
imported sand    244,208,160  ->  250,218,170  ->  246,212,164     (nearly white, then back)
arena blocks p10      0.0234  ->       0.0366  ->       0.0270     (shadow ratio 24.5 -> 15.9 -> 21.3)
engine plane      109,101,78  ->   116,106,81  ->   111,103,79
```
So the theme gets a real lift in its deep shadows without pushing a ground that was already near clipping
any further. That middle column is why the generator states a value instead of inheriting one.

**A source pin must not be scoped by a character count.** Three harnesses failed this build for one
reason — `src.match(/function applyWorldCfg[\s\S]{0,4000}/)`, `{0,2600}` on `updateDayNight` — and in every
case the assertion was still TRUE; adding a comment had simply pushed the needle past the end of the slice.
`extractFunction(name)` brace-matches and cannot drift. Every UNANCHORED window has now been converted
(856, 858, 859, 863, 864, 865, 959, 1127). The remaining ones anchor on a closing brace or on a named
following declaration, so they fail loudly only when a function outgrows its budget — and converting
those would change what the assertion covers, so leave them.

## The bake was gated on a texture-filtering capability (build 1150)

Build 1095 put two unrelated things in one statement in the imported-material pass:

```js
if(MAX_ANISO > 1){ for(const m of ms){ ...anisotropy...
  if(m.userData.rumpusLightmap && m.aoMap && !m.lightMap){ ...adopt as lightMap... } } }
```

`MAX_ANISO` is `Math.min(8, getMaxAnisotropy())`, which is **1** on a driver that reports no anisotropic
filtering — low-end Android, some software rasterisers. On any such device the whole block was skipped, so
a generated level's radiance bake stayed in the `aoMap` slot. That is not cosmetic: `aoMap` MULTIPLIES the
ambient and can only darken, while `lightMap` ADDS coloured indirect light — and the bake carries the
interior lamps, which are the only thing lighting a generated building's inside. The device that could
least afford it lost its interior lighting and got a dirty AO wash instead. `test-1150` drives the block
directly at `MAX_ANISO` 1 and 8, because a source pin cannot tell you which branch a nested `if` guards.

## What the ground probe settled (build 1150)

Build 1149 recorded the desert arena's 2.3-stop ground seam with two candidate causes and the instruction
to probe before theorising. The probe (`scratchpad/probe-ground.mjs` — raycast down at eight forward
offsets, report per hit the src, the material colour in linear, every map slot, `envMapIntensity` and
`lightMapIntensity`) answered both in one run:

- **NOT the texture albedo.** `sand` measures 0.511/0.372/0.185 linear against the desert theme's stated
  `groundAlb` of 0.42/0.34/0.22 — close enough that the generator's grounds are honest about themselves.
  This was the leading hypothesis and it is wrong.
- **There is a real `envMapIntensity` gap, and it is NOT the seam** (established after this build was
  written — see Open work). The imported ground reads `env1.00`; the engine's own boundary wall, same
  roughness class, reads `env0.12`. Build 1144 made that property one expression — `_envInten(metalness)`
  — for `floorMat`, `wallMat`, `primitiveMat`, `applyPropShine` and the instancing batch, and it never
  reached an imported model, which keeps three's default of 1.0: 8× the image-based ambient for two
  surfaces meant to be the same world. Closing it moved the seam by 3–12 code values and cost the weapon
  27%, so it was measured and reverted. Worth knowing the gap exists; do not expect it to fix anything.
- **A related surprise worth keeping:** 29 standard materials are constructed in `breach.html` and exactly
  ONE sets `envMapIntensity`. Build 1144 established the derivation for the world surfaces — floor, walls,
  primitives — and every decorative prop the engine builds (coins, pickups, debris, remote bodies) sits at
  three's default 1.0 alongside every import. "The engine uses 0.12" was never true; it is a minority
  convention, and the ground plane is on the dark side of it.

**`SKY_ENV_FLOOR = 0.12` was derived from a ratio build 1149 disproved — and survives re-deriving.** Build
1144 justified 0.12 as "a sun-to-shade ratio of 3:1 needs total ambient at 0.0305", and 1149 measured the
frame at 9.46:1. So the stated derivation is void. Swept by capture on the stock level, with the bounce in
place, measuring lit and shadowed patches of the same floor:

```
SKY_ENV_FLOOR   0.12     0.30     0.55     1.00
lit floor       83,120,121  88,125,130  95,132,140  105,143,154
shade            9,47,59    18,58,74    30,71,92     49,93,118
sun-to-shade      6.90:1     5.07:1     3.75:1       2.57:1
```
Real daylight on a horizontal surface is ~8:1, so **0.12 is the closest of the four** and raising it walks
the frame toward overcast. 1144's other figure — "at a full 1.0 the ratio is 1.58:1" — is also wrong;
measured it is 2.57:1. Right value, void reasoning: re-derive it here rather than trusting either note.

**The unification was written, measured, and thrown away.** It does NOT close the seam — see Open work for
the numbers. It was parked here because `_envInten(m) = max(SKY_ENV_FLOOR, m)` still couples to metalness above
the floor, and the shipped weapon's materials are all metalness 0.4 — so it would drop from 1.0 to 0.4 and
the weapon block measured `91,104,111 → 66,78,85`, a 27% darkening of an asset that was never tuned
against that coupling (builds 1140 and 1145 measured it at 1.0). 1144's compatibility argument — "metals
keep exactly the reflection strength they were tuned with" — applies to engine materials and to nothing a
creator imported. That trade — 27% off the weapon for 3–12 code values on the
seam — is why it is not in the tree. If a future build wants the consistency for its own sake, the physically
coherent form is `envMapIntensity = 1` everywhere with `worldCfg.sky` scaled down to deliver the same
ambient, and that needs a legacy-`sky` story; the `max(floor, metal)` shape is a compatibility hack that
only ever had an argument for engine-built materials.

## The ground albedo is now the ground it draws (build 1151)

Build 1143 introduced `groundMood` so "the plane the player walks past and the bounce the bake assumed are
the same surface". Measured in build 1150, they were not: `light.groundAlb` was a hand-picked triple and the
material the generator actually DRAWS is `MATS[palette.ground].base × mean(texture)`, linearised per pixel.
Wrong in every theme, from 0.35× to 1.59×:

```
theme        drawn (linear)        was                ratio    bounce now
industrial   0.110/0.114/0.117     0.20/0.21/0.22     0.54x    0.47
castle       0.154/0.136/0.113     0.22/0.19/0.15     0.71x    0.39
volcanic     0.142/0.091/0.053     0.16/0.13/0.10     0.74x    0.54
garden       0.034/0.067/0.011     0.12/0.18/0.08     0.35x    0.96
desert       0.511/0.372/0.185     0.42/0.34/0.22     1.11x    0.14
frost        0.779/0.829/0.900     0.60/0.64/0.70     1.29x    0.06
facility     0.165/0.189/0.222     0.10/0.12/0.14     1.59x    0.29
```

FOUR things derive from that one value, and all four want the real one — which is why this was worth doing
rather than tolerating: the bake's sun-bounce colour, the sky dome's ground band, the engine plane's
`floorColor`/`wallColor` (1143), and the one-bounce fill factor (1149). Every one of them now describes the
same surface, verified per channel per theme.

**`Tex.rgb` is sRGB, not linear.** `toBytes` writes `px * 255` with no transfer and the glTF
`baseColorTexture` is sRGB-tagged, so the renderer decodes it. The effective albedo is therefore
`base × mean(srgb2lin(rgb))` — **linearise per pixel, then average**. Averaging first and linearising after
is a different and wrong number, and it is the easy mistake here.

**The fill clamp moved from 0.8 to 1.0.** Once `gnd` was real, garden's grass measured Y 0.056 and asked for
0.96 to deliver the standard fill; 0.8 held it 16% short and broke the equal-fill property the derivation
exists for. 0.8 was arbitrary; the equal fill is not. Every theme now delivers within 1.10×.

**The test enforces the link rather than restating the numbers.** `test-1151` recomputes all seven from the
REAL generator — `arenaPalette(theme).ground` → `MATS[idx]` → `TEXS[tex].rgb` → base — so retuning a texture
without updating the mood fails there instead of silently putting the engine's ground a stop away from the
arena's. That is what 1143 wanted and did not get: naming a value once is not the same as deriving it from
the thing it describes. It needs no browser and runs at `TEXSIZE=128`, where the mean is stable (checked at
64/128/256: grass and sand agree to four decimals, the patterned `scifiFloor` drifts 4%).

Two pins moved with it, both correctly: `test-1143`'s "facility is a dark cool apron" threshold (the drawn
apron really is 1.59× brighter than the guess, so the plane matches it at 113,120,130 — cool still holds),
and `test-1149`'s clamp bound.

**The capture could NOT verify this build, and that is worth stating.** Garden and frost were captured as the
two extremes (0.35× and 1.29×) to check nothing crushed or blew out — nothing did: garden's near ground
measures min 78/67/46 with no channel at or below 8, frame mean 120,124,118. But that near ground reads warm
brown (86/77/55, R>G>B) while garden's new `floorColor` is a dark green — so the surface in shot is the
IMPORTED ground, and the engine plane is not in the frame at all. Whether it is depends on where the
generator put the spawn: the desert `arena-walk` shot happens to stand outside the footprint, garden's does
not. So the capture is a sanity check here and the *verification* is `test-1151`'s exact per-channel
assertions.

That is the third time in one session that a frame did not contain the surface being reasoned about (see
"the arena-edge seam was never a seam"). The cheap guard is already built: the radiance probe's `WHO[...]`
label names the mesh, its geometry, whether the material is `floorMat`/`wallMat`, and whether it is
instanced. **Read WHO before attributing anything to a surface.**

**Frost's clipping, A/B'd against its own pre-1151 value**, because a 1.29× brighter ground is where a
blow-out would show. Same seed, same camera, only `gnd` changed:

```
                   pixels >= 254    frame mean       snow field mean
pre-1151 gnd            1.10%      128,136,138       159,167,169
1151 (drawn) gnd        1.59%      129,137,140       162,171,172
```
So the change costs **half a percentage point of clipped pixels and three code values** on the snow. Frost
already clipped 1.10% before it — a sunlit snowfield clips, and so do photographs of one. Worth stating
plainly rather than hiding: this build does make frost's brightest surfaces marginally more clipped, and it
is the right trade because the albedo is now a measured fact about the texture rather than a guess. If it
ever needs pulling back, the lever is frost's `exposure` (1.2), not `gnd`.

`moodCb.checked` defaults to true, so "Place in level" really does apply the generated world block —
`Object.assign(worldCfg, r.world); applyWorldCfg()`. Checked because "the mood never reached the engine"
would have been a tidy explanation for a dark plane, and it is not the explanation.

## A sprite was casting a drop shadow out of the AO buffer (build 1152)

Reported from play with a screenshot: a hard square around muzzle flashes and impact sprites. **The user
diagnosed it, after I had measured six times and published the opposite conclusion.** Their read: AO is
giving the transparent quad a DROP SHADOW. The one-line test settles it — set **World → Camera & view →
Ambient occlusion to 0** and the square is gone.

The cause: the prepass renders with `scene.overrideMaterial = _matAOGeo`, which replaces `transparent` and
`depthWrite:false` along with everything else, so a sprite writes its quad into the half-res G-buffer as
solid geometry. SSAO then treats that quad as an OCCLUDER and darkens the world around and behind it — an
invisible box casting a shadow. Builds 1126 and 1128 fixed this same trap twice by NAME (the sky dome, then
the weather points); the flipbook VFX are the third instance, so 1152 replaces the naming with a rule:
nothing that fails to write depth belongs in a depth-derived buffer.

**Why no further capture is needed:** AO=0 removes the artifact, so it is AO-derived; a SQUARE AO artifact at
a sprite can only come from that sprite's own footprint in the AO G-buffer; hiding the sprite from that pass
removes the footprint.

### Six failed measurements, and why each one lied

Worth the space, because every one produced a plausible-looking result and four would have been reported as
findings:

| # | attempt | why it failed |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | fire at the horizon | sprite against SKY — no occlusion there to differ. Clean null. |
| 2 | "pitch down" then fire | the mouse moves netted zero movementY. Same null again. |
| 3 | 3 page loads, pinned rotation | 53% of the frame differed — in the CONTROL too. `postGrain` is stochastic per frame. |
| 4 | animated smoke, block means | 26 "bright blocks"… the control showed 28. Animation phase across respawns. |
| 5 | static fully-transparent quad | effect ordered by CAPTURE TIME, not by the flag. Settling drift. |
| 6 | read the AO buffers directly | all zeros INCLUDING the reference patch — `_aoGeoRT` is HalfFloat, read into a `Uint8Array`. |

Only #5 and #6 carried controls, and that is the only reason I knew they had failed. **Without the reference
patch in #6 I would have reported "the sprite is definitively not in the G-buffer" as a measured fact.** A
control pair is not optional in this engine: grain, weapon sway, animation phase and settling drift each
exceed the effects being looked for.

Why #5 was insensitive, which is the technical lesson: `overrideMaterial` replaces `SpriteMaterial`, and a
`Sprite`'s billboarding lives in that material's own vertex shader. What reaches the G-buffer is the raw unit
quad through a standard vertex shader — an axis-aligned quad in the world XY plane, not a camera-facing
billboard. Depending on camera yaw that quad can be nearly EDGE-ON, with almost no footprint. The ghost
sprite was very likely edge-on: the configuration in which the bug cannot show. **The mechanism was right and
the probe was pointed the wrong way.**

And the meta-lesson, which cost the most: I stated a mechanism-level diagnosis, failed to confirm it, then
published a retraction calling it disproved. **Failing to measure something is not evidence of its absence**
— least of all with an instrument that had already failed five times. The retraction was worse than the
original claim, because the original was correct. When a code-level mechanism is solid and the measurement
is null, suspect the measurement.

### What the build actually changed



Reported from play, with a screenshot: a hard, slightly **brighter** rectangle around muzzle flashes and
explosion/impact sprites — the PNG quad's own edge, the transparent area reading lighter than the scene.

The AO prepass renders with `scene.overrideMaterial = _matAOGeo`, and **`overrideMaterial` replaces
`transparent` and `depthWrite:false` along with everything else.** So a sprite wrote its whole QUAD into the
half-res G-buffer as though it were solid geometry a metre from the camera; SSAO then derived that square's
occlusion from a flat camera-facing surface — unoccluded — while the world around it kept its real
occlusion. Less darkening inside the square than outside it, with a quad edge.

**FIXED AGAIN IN BUILD 1158 — this section's fix covered the world scene only.** The muzzle flash lives in
the VIEWMODEL scene, which build 1140 renders into the same G-buffer, and that render had no sweep. See
"Two fixes that were applied to the wrong half".

**This is the same trap build 1126 recorded and build 1128 hit again, now for the third time.** 1126: "the
sky dome fills the buffer unless it is hidden for the pass. Weather points do the same." Both were fixed by
NAME, and the flipbook VFX arrived later. Naming a third would only buy a fourth, so the test is now a
property of the material: **nothing that does not write depth belongs in a depth-derived G-buffer.** The
prepass hides any object whose material has `depthWrite === false || transparent === true` and restores it
after — one traverse, which is nothing beside the extra half-res scene render the pass already costs.

Three details in the predicate, each of which would be a bug on its own:
- **Already-invisible objects are not collected**, or the restore would switch them ON — editor gizmos in
  play, which is a bug build 1139 already recorded from the other direction (`Raycaster` ignores a mesh's own
  `visible:false` but not its ancestors').
- **One offending slot in a multi-material array is enough**, because the object is drawn or it is not.
- **The viewmodel still goes in** (build 1140). It is opaque geometry and its own occlusion is that build's
  entire point; this must not sweep it out.

**Sprite sheets were the wrong suspect, and worth recording as such.** The procedural sheets are clean: every
gradient in `_drawExplosionFrame` / `_drawMuzzleFrame` / `_drawSmokeFrame` ends at `rgba(0,0,0,0)`, and
`AdditiveBlending` in three is `src·srcAlpha + dst`, so a transparent pixel adds exactly nothing. Reading the
report as "the PNG's transparency is wrong" would have sent the fix into the sheet baker, which is correct
code.

**Probably not caused by this session's builds, but plausibly made visible by one.** The prepass is 1126 and
nothing since touched it — but 1149 added a bounce term that lifts the ambient, and SSAO multiplies the
ambient, so the AO term's visible contrast went up. A pre-existing artifact getting easier to see is
consistent with a report of "now".

## The number of lights must not change during play (build 1153)

Reported from play: **loot boxes spawning mid-match froze the game for 2-3 seconds.** The user's guess was
right — `buildChestMesh` did `new THREE.PointLight(...)` and `mesh.add(beam)` for every crate. Adding a light
changes the SCENE'S LIGHT COUNT, and in three that invalidates every lit material's program, so the first
crate to appear recompiled every shader in the level. Removing the crate took the light out with it and did
the same on the way out. Editor markers are built by the same function and toggled with `.visible`, and an
invisible light is not counted, so opening the editor recompiled too.

**This is the THIRD time this exact fault has shipped**, which is why it is now written down as a rule rather
than fixed once more in place:

| build | what it hit | what it did |
|---|---|---|
| 636 | the first explosion | `_blastLightPool`, pre-seated at load, so a blast only ever RE-AIMS an existing light |
| 977 | the first flashlight toggle | left it *"ALWAYS visible at intensity 0 — toggling `.visible` changes the light count and recompiles every shader (the first-L freeze)"* |
| 1153 | the first loot box | a pooled beam, claimed and released |

**The rule: the number of lights in the scene must not change during play.** Position, colour, distance and
intensity are plain uniforms and are free to change every frame. Existence is not — and neither is
`.visible`, which is the trap that catches people who know the first half of the rule.

Four decisions in the loot-box pool worth keeping:
- **The beam is not parented to the crate.** That is what made removal a second recompile. Pooled lights sit
  in the scene permanently and are positioned in world space; the crate's idle bob is ±0.08, which a 16 m
  point light cannot show anyway.
- **Seated where a recompile is already happening** — at load beside `_ensureBlastLights`, and again at
  DEPLOY in `spawnPlacedLoot`. Growing the pool is itself a count change, so it must never happen mid-match.
- **Sized from the level's own loot spots** (a marker and a crate can be live for the same spot at once) plus
  the random-spawn cap. Past that a crate spawns with NO beam: a missing glow is a far better failure than a
  frozen game.
- **A reconcile, not four edits.** Crates are removed from four places — the co-op snapshot reconciler, a
  client's `buyChest`, the local buy, and `wipeScene`. `updateChests` reclaims any beam whose owner has gone,
  so no removal path can leak one, and a leaked beam is not cosmetic: it is a crate that never glows again
  for the rest of the match.

**The same fault arrives by a second route on a custom crate model, and that is fixed here too.** GLTFLoader
turns `KHR_lights_punctual` into a real three light, and nothing in this engine's model path touches
`o.isLight` — so a `lootbox.glb` containing a light adds one to the scene on EVERY spawn, which is the
identical recompile by a different door. A crate already has its pooled beam, so a model's own light is
redundant as well as expensive: `buildChestMesh` now strips them, removing them from their parent rather
than hiding them (hiding a light changes the count too — build 977).

And `buildChestMesh` calls `loadGLTFCached` LAZILY, so with a custom model the first crate of a match also
paid for the fetch, the parse and the first-render program compile of its materials. `warmChestModel()` does
that at deploy the way build 622 warms the flipbook programs — instantiate once off-screen, compile, remove —
and strips lights from the warm instance too, or warming would itself move the count. It runs once per url,
and a failed load resets so the next deploy retries.

Worth knowing for the general case: imported models' own lights were unhandled everywhere else — **CLOSED in
build 1157**, which routes every imported prop's lights through `registerEmitterLight` after rescaling them out
of glTF candela and giving them a finite reach. The "decision about creators who legitimately ship a lamp"
turned out not to be the hard part: reading GLTFLoader showed the intensity and the range were broken
independently of the freeze.

## A probe cannot silently measure a build that is not in the tree (build 1389 — tooling)

This container has now rolled back **fifteen** times, and `mkprobe` reads whatever `breach.html` happens to
be on disk. So a rollback landing between a build and its probe produces a staging of an OLD build that
boots fine, renders fine, and answers a question about code that is no longer in the tree.

**It happened during 1388's session.** A probe staged inside a rollback window reported
`_odBumpU is not defined` about a constant the tree had declared five builds earlier;
`grep -c _odBumpU probe-out/probe.html` returned **0** against 3 in `breach.html`, and the staging was 18 KB
smaller and a minute older. Everything measured through it was about build 1381.

**The tell was luck.** The rollback happened to be deep enough to remove an identifier the probe named, so
it threw. One build shallower and every number would have looked perfectly plausible and been wrong — which
is the failure this rig can least afford, because a probe is how everything here gets decided.

`docs/frames/README.md` has said *"know what BUILD you are measuring — stamp it or diff it"* since build
1382. This is that, enforced rather than remembered: `mkprobe` writes the `BUILD_VERSION` **out of the very
text it staged** (not out of the repo separately, which would let the two disagree) into `probe-out/BUILD`
and prints it; `driver.mjs` refuses to launch when it disagrees with the repo.

Four things about the guard, each deliberate:
- **It runs on the first line of `withGame`**, ahead of the file server and the browser launch, so a stale
  run costs a second instead of fifteen minutes and a wrong conclusion.
- **It names the fix.** *"holds build 1381, the repo is build 1388 — re-run: node tools/probe/mkprobe.mjs
  <dir>"*. A guard that reports a mystery is a guard people disable.
- **`PROBE_SKIP_STAMP=1` is an explicit opt-out**, because measuring an OLD build on purpose is a real thing
  to want (an A/B against a previous version), and the only alternative to an escape hatch is people
  deleting the check.
- **It degrades rather than blocking**: no `breach.html`, or one with no `BUILD_VERSION`, is allowed
  through. A rig that fails closed on a missing file stops every probe in the repo.

`test-1389` executes the real exported guard through all five branches in a temp directory — including that
a MATCHING stamp does not throw, which is the case that would otherwise break every probe here.

### And a functional smoke test, because the Node harness structurally cannot play the game

`tools/probe/smoke.mjs`. Builds 1386/1387/1388 each patched shaders that every prop and both engine surfaces
compile against, and **the failure mode of a bad shader patch in this engine is silent** — a plausible frame
with a subsystem missing from it. 17 checks against the live game: `glGetError`, program diagnostics, draw
calls and triangle count, that the frame is not black and carries real tonal content, that props/colliders/
lights are seated, that firing spends a round and `damageProp` reduces health, that an enemy spawns with a
mesh in the scene, that the editor opens/switches/closes, that the level serializes and re-parses carrying
the authored normal map, and that the rung ladder moves both relief amplitudes and returns. **17/17.**

Two findings fell out of writing it, neither of which was what it was looking for:
- **`propModels` carries NULL HOLES** — build 1167's asset-failure path leaves one where a model url 404s.
  Anything that walks that array unguarded throws, which is how this probe first died. The stock level has
  none, and the smoke test now asserts that.
- **The stock level has ZERO breakable props.** `damageProp`, `shatterProp`, the debris, the break sounds
  (1314) and the per-prop impact audio (1305) are all shipped and the first level a player ever sees uses
  none of them — you can shoot everything in the opening scene and nothing ever breaks. That is content, not
  code, and it is a gameplay-feel gap worth its own pass.

### A backtick inside a template literal, for the fourth time

`// through \`damageProp\` directly` inside a `P(\`...\`)` string closed the template. CLAUDE.md records
this under builds 1328, 1342 and 1357, and this probe became the fourth. **Write prose comments inside a
template literal with no backticks at all** — the habit, not the vigilance, is what fixes it.

## The deck gets relief off its own colour, for no extra fetches (build 1388)

Build 1387 gave the two ENGINE surfaces an authored normal map correlated with their albedo — and the census
its own tooling made possible said the engine floor plane is **3% of the stock frame** while the instanced
primitive deck is **~90%**. Primitives cannot use those maps: build 1384's texture modulation is triplanar
and object-space, and their `normalMap` slot holds 1139's procedural value-noise, which is a *different
field* from the one modulating their colour. 1387's defect exactly, one layer down, on the surface that
actually fills the frame.

**The height is `_odTexL` — the luminance build 1384's albedo modulation already sampled.** One sample, two
uses: still exactly three `texture2D(uOdTex` fetches, and the relief is correlated with the colour BY
CONSTRUCTION rather than by a matching pair of files that could drift. It is Mikkelsen's surface gradient
(what three's own `perturbNormalArb` computes), which needs no UVs and no tangent basis, so it works on a
primitive of any shape at any scale.

`PROP_TEX_RELIEF = 0.018` is a **depth in metres**, not a gain: the surface gradient divides a height
derivative by a POSITION derivative and both are per-pixel view units, so the ratio is dimensionless and the
constant has to be a real distance. 1.8 cm is a shallow cast-concrete relief at the shipped ~4 m tile.

### Three things in the GLSL, each of which is a defect without it

- **The `#if` is what makes `dFdx` legal.** On WebGL 1 it needs `GL_OES_standard_derivatives`, and three
  emits that directive only for `extensionDerivatives || envMapCubeUVHeight || bumpMap ||
  tangentSpaceNormalMap || clearcoatNormalMap || flatShading || shaderID === 'physical'`. Every define in
  the guard — `TANGENTSPACE_NORMALMAP`, `USE_BUMPMAP`, `FLAT_SHADED`, `PHYSICAL` — is one of those terms, so
  the code cannot compile without the extension that makes it legal. `test-1388` asserts that
  correspondence **against the real three build**, because if an upgrade changes either side the guard stops
  guarding and nothing errors. Probed live: **16 of 16** materials carrying `_odTex` also carry a
  tangent-space normal map, so the gate is satisfied for every one of them.
- **The branch is on TWO UNIFORMS, deliberately.** A derivative taken inside non-uniform control flow is
  undefined in GLSL ES. That is also why the degenerate case is a SELECT at the end rather than an early
  out — all four `dFdx`/`dFdy` calls have to sit where the whole quad agrees they run.
- **`normalize()` of a degenerate surface gradient is NaN, and three's own version carries it.**
  `perturbNormalArb` ends `normalize( abs(fDet)*surf_norm - vGrad )`; when the surface derivative
  degenerates, `sign(0)` is 0, the whole vector is 0, and `normalize(0)` is NaN. One dot product buys the
  unperturbed normal instead of a black pixel.

### Measured — and the shader's health first, because that is what this build could get catastrophically wrong

```
glGetError 0 · 66 programs · 338 draw calls · 24,528 tris · 0 program diagnostics
22 patched materials · 16 carrying uOdTexN · 16 of 16 tangent-space normal mapped
window 19,728 pixels, drawn: instanced BoxGeometry 19,400 · floorMat 736 · wedge 319

control (same condition)   uniq  +0.02%   grad  -0.01%

return                     uniq  -0.31%   grad  -0.04%
```

`grad` is the mean absolute difference between horizontal neighbours — relief is LOCAL variation. **Three
times 1387's effect (+24.5% against +7.8%), because it lands on the surface that is 90% of the frame rather
than the one that is 3%**, and the mean luminance moves 0.09%, so it is structure and not exposure.

It rides build 1383's rung ladder through the same `_syncOdBump` — **one ladder, two amplitudes.** This is
derivative-based bump, quantised to the 2x2 fragment quad, so it is precisely the high-frequency normal
detail that must not outrun a shedding antialiaser; that argument is 1383's and it applies here unchanged.

**A `sed`-proof note on the ordering, inherited from 1379:** `_odTexL` is written at `map_fragment` and read
at `normal_fragment_maps`. `test-1388` asserts three still emits them in that order — get it backwards and
the height is read before it is written, which is silent garbage rather than an error.

One pin moved (1383's `let _odBumpBase = 0;` gained a second declarator on the same line; its intent — the
base is declared above the boot call that reads it — is unchanged and still asserted).

### Container rollback #14, mid-build

The tree reverted to build 1381 between two commands, with the tell being `tools/probe/drawn-at.mjs`
vanishing on import and `ls tests | wc -l` reading 1128 against 1134. `git log` first, then
`git fetch origin <branch> && git reset --hard FETCH_HEAD` restored everything, because every build is
pushed the moment it lands. Fourteenth occurrence; the protocol cost about ninety seconds.

## A range target comes back (build 1391)

Build 1390 made a static prop shootable. A booth full of plates you can destroy exactly once is not a
shooting range — and before this the ONLY restore was `restoreDestroyedProps()`, called from exactly two
places: the deploy path and entering the editor. A shot target was gone for the rest of the session.

`resetprop` is a tag verb beside the other five. It needed no new message type and no new mapping: the
handler derives its action by slicing `prop` off the verb name, so `resetprop` yields `reset`, and clients
mirror it through build 1170's existing `wact` `pv` payload.

### The filter that would have made it a silent no-op

`_lgPropVerb` skipped any `_shattered` prop, for every verb. `reset` is the ONE that must see them —
they are exactly what it exists to bring back. Written the obvious way, the verb would have done nothing
on the only props anybody would ever aim it at, **and every source pin would still have passed**.

### One restore body, because two is how they drift

The restore was inline in `restoreDestroyedProps`, and the verb would have been a second copy — the defect
this file records under builds 1162, 1252, 1266 and 1280, every time as *two implementations of one
behaviour and only one maintained*. `_restoreDestroyedProp(o)` is now the shared body; the deploy path is a
loop over it. It returns **false when the prop was never destroyed**, which is what lets the verb fall
through to topping up a merely damaged one.

**And build 1390 made it need a new line.** That build releases the static Rapier body when a prop shatters,
so a restored static prop has to be given one back — otherwise a reset target comes home visible and
**intangible**, and shots pass straight through the plate you just restored. One build creating the
requirement the next build must satisfy, four hours apart.

### Both cases in one verb, deliberately

A destroyed prop is restored; a merely damaged one is topped up; a hidden one comes back. A creator wiring
"reset the targets" means *the booth returns to its starting state* — having to know whether each plate
happened to be destroyed or just dented is exactly the distinction they should not have to make.

### Measured, driven from a real event node through the real dispatch

Build 1277's rule is that a test pinning the two ends of a wire proves nothing about the wire, so the probe
fired an `event` node rather than calling the handler:

```
destroyed   shattered, invisible, out of colliders, Rapier body released
reset       restored at home, visible, collider back, BODY BACK, hp 30/30, in the scene
re-shot     takes damage again (30 -> 20)     <- a target you can kill only once is not a range
dented      40 -> 25 -> reset -> 40
```

`test-1391` walks all seven links of the chain separately — dropdown, tag field, signal router, world
handler, name-slice, per-prop applier, `_LG_TAG_VERBS` — because the missing link in 1277's case was the
third one and nothing else would have found it.

**Seven pins moved**, all from the verb lists and the restore refactor, each keeping its intent: 1033, 1170,
1258 (×2), 1277 (27 verbs → 28), 1299 (its "a tag resolves to a LIST" assertion now reads the split loop),
1157 and 120 (both follow the restore body to its new home).

## A target can be shot without having to be a physics body (build 1390)

Asked for by the level being built toward this engine — a county-fair gauntlet whose first booth is a
shooting range. `damageProp`'s first line was `if(!obj.userData.phys || obj.userData.breakable===false)
return false;` and the editor's **Breakable** checkbox lived inside `if(sel.userData.phys){`. So the only
way to make anything shootable was to make it a **dynamic rigid body** — it wobbles, gets shoved, falls
over, and streams in the multiplayer snapshot. Exactly wrong for a steel plate or a paper target.

**The opt-in could NOT have been `breakable`, and checking that is what saved this build from breaking every
level ever saved.** `applyPropDynState` sets `userData.breakable = true` on EVERY prop it loads unless the
file says `brk:false`. Relaxing the gate to accept `breakable === true` would have made **every wall in
every level shootable**. `shootable` is a new flag defaulting to undefined, so nothing that exists today
changes by one byte — asserted by executing the predicate on `{breakable:true}` and getting `false`.

Three places had to follow it, and each was a defect on its own:
- **`explodeAt` sweeps `dynamicProps`**, which a static target is not in — so a grenade at the range would
  have left every plate standing while the crates beside them broke. A second opt-in-only sweep covers them.
- **The serializer's destruction fields were inside `if(o.userData.phys){`**, so a target saved neither its
  flag nor its HP and came back an ordinary indestructible box on the next load. The round-trip probe found
  that; the block moved out to `if(phys || shootable)`, while mass, grabbing and fire stayed inside, because
  those are about a BODY.
- **The editor's destruction controls had the same gate**, so the feature would have had no door (1348).

### And a LIVE defect found on the way, which predates this build

`shatterProp`'s static branch spliced the collider out of the list and **left the Rapier rigid body in the
physics world** — an invisible wall that dynamic props bounce off. Build 1194 fixed exactly this for
`hideprop`; this branch never got it. It was reachable *before* this build through the logic graph's
`delprop` on a static prop, and every static target would have hit it on the shot that killed it.

### Measured live

```
a plain static wall          999 damage -> refused, all 50 HP intact   (every existing level unchanged)
a target that opted in       30 -> 20 -> shattered, never in dynamicProps
the Rapier body              created (positive control) -> released, _physStatic null
an explosion                 reaches static targets
round trip                   { sht:1, hp:30 }
```

**The Rapier check was VACUOUS on its first run** — the probe's prop had no body at all, so "no leak" was
true for the wrong reason and I nearly recorded the fix on no evidence. The control (`addStaticColliderFor`
first, then assert the body existed) is what makes the second run mean anything. Same lesson as build 1316's:
*before believing a null result, prove the instrument can produce a positive one.*

**A naming note that cost one test run:** the destruction fields live in `applyPropDynState`, not in
`_applyPropEntry` — the latter delegates to it on its first line. Build 1280's one-apply-site property holds
one level down, and the test asserts both halves so the delegation cannot quietly disappear.

### Still open for the range booth

A destroyed target cannot come back during play: `restoreDestroyedProps()` has exactly two call sites, the
deploy path and entering the editor. A `resetprop` verb is the next build.

## Relief that describes the same surface as the colour (build 1387)

The critic's second verified finding: `PROC_SLOTS` is `normalMap` + `roughnessMap` fed ONLY by build 1139's
procedural value-noise, so no authored normal or roughness map was loaded anywhere in the level. Build 1378
gave the ground and the boundary walls a real albedo and left `floorTexN`/`wallTexN` empty — structure in
the colour, unrelated micro-noise in the relief, which is a printed photograph with bumps on it.

**The machinery was already there and the CLI just never wrote it out.** Every entry in the generator's
texture library carries a height field `t.h`, and `normalPx(t.h, S, strength)` is what the arena bake has
used for hundreds of builds. `node tools/levelgen.mjs tex <id> <out.png>` emitted the albedo alone. It now
writes `<stem>-n.png` and `<stem>-r.png` beside it, off the SAME `make()` call.

**That sameness is the entire design, and it is proven by hash rather than asserted.** Regenerating the
albedo at the shipped size produced a file **byte-identical** to the one already committed (`335e47af…`,
`43198910…`) — so the normal map provably comes from the same seed and the same height field, and the crack
in the albedo and the crease in the normal are the same crack. `test-1387` re-derives both maps from the
real generator and compares decoded pixels: **worst channel delta 0.**

Three conventions carried over rather than reinvented: the strength is the glTF bake's own
`2.2 x S/256` (world-space relief constant across resolutions) times the library entry's `nrm`, so an engine
surface and a generated arena agree about how deep a concrete crack is; it is **baked into the map** rather
than left to `material.normalScale`, because `floorMat`/`wallMat` are SHARED and a creator's own map would
inherit whatever scale was left behind (1139's rule, and the test asserts nothing writes `normalScale`); and
the aux maps are half-res like the bake's, which is 30 KB against 112 KB for 3.7x less relief detail than
the eye can use at a 4 m tile.

**The roughness slot stays EMPTY, and that is the honest half.** Neither `concrete` nor `panels` carries an
`mr` field — about half the 34 library entries do — so there is nothing to source a roughness map from.
Deriving one from the height field would be making data up. An empty slot is not a hole: `_procFallback`
restores 1139's procedural roughness.

### Measured — 21,058 pixels, every one proven-DRAWN floor plane

```
control (same condition)        uniq  0.00%   grad  0.00%
none -> procedural (was)        uniq +5.04%   grad +21.25%
none -> authored (this build)   uniq +10.31%  grad +30.73%
proc -> authored                uniq +5.01%   grad  +7.82%    lum -0.01%
x4 / x40 overdrive              grad +133.6% / +397.5%        return 0.00%
```

`grad` is the mean absolute difference between horizontal neighbours — relief is LOCAL variation, not a
level shift, and the mean luminance moving 0.01% is that stated as a measurement. The authored map does
about twice the work the procedural field was doing, and the procedural field was doing real work.

### The measurement was wrong three times, and the third failure is the useful one

| # | it reported | why |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | authored vs procedural: −2.3%, and a 4x overdrive only +0.45% | a positive control that barely fires invalidates every null beside it. Something was wrong |
| 2 | removing the normal map ENTIRELY changed 0.00%, and x40 changed 0.03% | not a subtle effect — the map was not reaching those pixels at all |
| 3 | the compiled program had `USE_NORMALMAP`, the sampler, `perturbNormal2Arb` and `normalMap, vUv` | the shader was fine. **The WINDOW was not the floor** |

Painting `floorMat` bright red moved the 7,621-pixel window by **0.01** while moving the whole frame by 2.2.
The window filter accepted a pixel when the first *Standard/Physical* raycast hit was `floor` — and r149
reports an `InstancedMesh` hit against the SHARED unit-box geometry (build 1139's documented signature), so
a `distance < 2.0` cut threw the deck away and the floor behind it won every time.

`tools/probe/drawn-at.mjs` is the durable fix: **what the RENDERER draws**, which is the first hit whose
object and every ancestor is visible and which is not the sky dome — no material filter and no distance cut,
because a nearer hit you filtered out still occludes. Re-verified with it, build 1386's window was **262 of
266 pixels genuinely `floorMat`**, so that build's record stands as written.

### And the finding nobody was looking for: the engine floor is 3% of the stock frame

The census that `drawnAt` made possible, by pose:

```
spawn (0,30) pitch -0.28    FLOOR-PLANE  3.4%    instanced BoxGeometry 89.8%
spawn (0,30) pitch -0.10    FLOOR-PLANE  3.0%    instanced BoxGeometry 74.2%   sky 16.1%
spawn (0,30) pitch -0.55    FLOOR-PLANE  0.0%    instanced BoxGeometry  100%
open ground (40,40)         FLOOR-PLANE 89.6%
```

**Where the game puts the player, essentially all the visible ground is the level's own primitive deck**, and
a primitive has no texture slots wired to these maps at all — build 1384's modulation is the only structure
it carries. So this build is correct, cheap and measurable, and it lands mostly on open ground and on empty
levels (which are nothing BUT the engine floor). Getting authored relief onto primitives is the next build,
and it is a bigger one: `applyObjDetail`'s triplanar path already samples a texture per fragment, so the
normal would ride the same three fetches rather than adding any.

## The two engine surfaces were the only non-physical materials in the game (build 1386)

The cold critic's #1 was that the frame is *"less flat-COLOURED than before and exactly as flat-LIT — no
highlight, no fresnel edge, no reflection... nothing tells the eye this is lit, only that it is coloured."*
Builds 1378-1385 all attacked albedo variation and none of them touched lighting response. The cause was
one assignment, made twice, and it is **build 1144's mistake one property over**:

    floorMat.specularIntensity = floorMat.metalness;   // "metal 0 => truly matte"
    wallMat.specularIntensity  = wallMat.metalness;

In r149's `lights_physical_fragment` that property scales **both** dielectric terms:

```glsl
material.specularF90  = mix( specularIntensityFactor, 1.0, metalnessFactor );
material.specularColor = mix( min(pow2((ior-1)/(ior+1)) * specularColorFactor, 1.0)
                              * specularIntensityFactor, diffuseColor.rgb, metalnessFactor );
```

So the floor at `metalness 0.1` had **F0 = 0.04 x 0.1 = 0.004** — a tenth of what every dielectric in nature
reflects head-on — and **F90 = mix(0.1, 1.0, 0.1) = 0.19**, where F90 is 1.0 for *every material there is*:
at grazing incidence everything is a mirror. The wall was 5x and 2.8x off the same two numbers.

**And it was exactly two surfaces, provably.** The physical fragment shader opens
`#ifdef PHYSICAL / #define IOR / #define SPECULAR`, so that branch is reached by a `MeshPhysicalMaterial`
and by nothing else — and the engine constructs exactly two, `floorMat` and `wallMat`. Every other material
in the file is a `MeshStandardMaterial`, which takes the chunk's `#else`: F0 0.04, F90 1.0, already
physical. **The ground plane and the boundary walls were the only surfaces in the game that were not**, and
they are the largest in any frame.

*"Matte" is high ROUGHNESS, not absent specular.* `floorRough` is already 0.95, which spreads the lobe until
it reads as concrete. Killing F0 as well does not make a surface matte; it makes it not a material.

### Measured, with the control that makes it mean something

266 pixels, each **raycast-proven to be the floor mesh** and proven unoccluded toward the sun — the window
is derived by projecting two ground points at fixed forward distance, never picked by eye. World paused,
grain and auto-exposure off:

```
control (0.1 vs 0.1)      0.00%      <- byte-identical, so the noise floor is zero
shipped 0.1 -> 1.0      +38.00%      near band (15.6 m) +29.6%   far band (68.6 m) +54.2%
10x overdrive          +152.52%      <- monotonic: the instrument can produce a positive
return to 0.1             0.00%
```

**The gain grows with the grazing angle, and that is the finding rather than the +38%.** A flat lift cannot
have that shape; F90 is the only term in the pipeline that does. It is a Fresnel gradient appearing on a
surface that had none.

In the SHIPPED configuration — auto-exposure left live at 0.7, so the frame is allowed to meter the extra
energy back out — the change is a **redistribution**, which is the honest way to state it:

```
repeat spread, same condition   frame 0.02-0.18%   grazing 0.08-0.27%    <- the real noise floor
EFFECT                          frame +0.68%       grazing band +5.90%   steep ground -0.18% (nil)
clipped pixels                  0.001% -> 0.001%   unique colours 19,066/19,380 -> 19,485/19,800
```

So: nothing blows out, the frame barely moves, steep-angle ground is unchanged — and the grazing band gains
**20x its own noise floor**. The ground stops being a flat albedo patch and acquires an angle-dependent
response. That is what the critic asked for, and it is a smaller *number* than the isolated measurement
precisely because the eye adapts, which is correct behaviour and not something to hide.

**The first shipped-config run was thrown away and it is worth saying why.** It sampled before
auto-exposure had settled — exposure climbed 1.7237 -> 1.7523 -> 1.7510 and never returned — so every
figure carried a one-way drift and the "return" condition did not return. A single A/B cannot tell an
effect from a settling curve. The probe now warms up for 30 s and then **alternates**, which is what
produced the repeat spread above.

### A comment that quotes code is a decoy for every grep

Both stale pins in this build were asserting the DEFECT (`test-1144`'s *"the coupling that IS correct
stays"*, `test-164`'s *"floor matte at metal 0"*), which is ordinary. What is worth recording is that
**`test-164`'s floor assertion PASSED against the removed line — by matching this build's own comment
quoting it** — while its wall assertion failed. Half a pin silently satisfied by prose. My new test hit the
identical trap ten minutes earlier, from the other direction: an assertion that the coupling was *gone*
failed because the comment was still there to find.

Two things came out of it, both applied here: the source comment states the removed line **in prose rather
than as the literal statement**, and every pin on it is scoped to real ASSIGNMENT STATEMENTS
(`/^\s*\w+(\.\w+)*\.specularIntensity = [^;]+;/gm`) rather than being a bare grep. This is the
character-budget trap's cousin: *a source pin is only as good as the uniqueness of what it matches, and a
build's own documentation is the most likely thing to collide with it.*

`test-1386` pins the whole premise against the **real vendored three** — both chunk lines, the
`#ifdef PHYSICAL` define block, the `#else` branch's `vec3(0.04)`/`1.0`, and that a `MeshStandardMaterial`
does not have the property at all — because if an upgrade moves any of that the rationale is void and the
engine must fail loudly rather than quietly go back to matte. `SKY_ENV_FLOOR` and `_envInten` are
deliberately untouched: build 1144 measured that value and 1150 re-derived it against a sweep, and it is a
different property answering a different question.

## The pillar was tiled like a boundary wall (build 1385)

Found by a cold rendering critic and verified at the line. **`wallMat` is shared**, and build 1378 derives
its texture repeat from the boundary wall's own span — `_surfRepeat(ARENA*2)` across and `_surfRepeat(H)`
up. Before 1378 `wallTex` was `''`, so that repeat governed nothing. The moment the wall gained a texture,
every other mesh sharing the material inherited a tiling tuned for a 140 x 8 m box — and `buildPillar`
shares it for a **16 m cylinder about 7.5 m around**:

```
             one tile spanned          after
around        0.22 m  (35 repeats)     ~3.8 m
up            8.0 m   (2 repeats)      ~4.0 m
             a 37:1 stretch            within 1.6x of the geometry's own aspect
```

On four objects standing at the default level's spawn. That is a 1378 regression, and it is the general
hazard of a shared material: its repeat belongs to whichever consumer it was derived for.

**The fix is per-geometry UVs, not a per-object material.** A clone would stop tracking the creator's wall
colour and texture through `applyWorldCfg`, and one material per pillar is a draw call per pillar. Scaling
the UV attribute is free — and the factor is a pure **ratio of spans**, `own / the span the repeat was
derived from`, so it never names `SURF_TILE_M` (which cancels out entirely), it stays correct when a
creator resizes the arena because both move together, and it survives a retune of the tile size.

`_uvRescale` refuses a zero, negative, NaN or missing factor rather than collapsing the geometry, and
`test-1385` executes all of that against the real three build — including that `CylinderGeometry` still
has UVs at all, since an upgrade dropping them would make this a silent no-op.

**One test-writing note worth keeping:** `BufferAttribute.needsUpdate` is a **set-only accessor** in three.
It bumps `version` and reads back `false`, so asserting `=== true` fails against correct code. The
observable effect is the version.

### What the critic said that this build does NOT address

Its sharper finding is that the frame is **less flat-coloured than before and exactly as flat-LIT**:
*"no highlight, no fresnel edge, no reflection... nothing tells the eye this is lit, only that it is
coloured."* Everything in builds 1378-1384 attacks albedo variation; none of it touches lighting response.
It scored the stock level **4/10** and explicitly declined to claim a delta from its earlier 3/10, because
no valid before-frame existed to measure one — which is the right call and is why `docs/frames/` now exists.

Its second verified defect is also open: `PROC_SLOTS` feeds only the procedural value-noise field, so no
authored normal or roughness map is loaded anywhere in the level. Combined with the flat specular that is
the real ceiling, and it is a bigger build than this one.

## A primitive gets material structure (build 1384)

A cold critic put the stock level at **3/10** and a GENERATED arena at **6/10** off the same renderer, and
named the difference exactly: the generator gives every piece it builds a real per-material albedo, while
the hand-built level's crates, ramps and pillars are untextured primitives. Build 1379's noise gave them
VARIATION; it cannot give them STRUCTURE — panel lines, brushed grain, wear — which is what reads as a
material rather than as plastic.

**A plain `map` cannot be the answer, and that is the whole design problem.** Build 1378 could compensate
`floorMat`'s base colour because the ENGINE owns it. A primitive's colour is the CREATOR'S, chosen in a
picker, and a map multiplies it — every prop in every level ever saved would have gone ~60% darker.

So the texture is a **mean-1.0 MODULATION**, not an albedo: its LUMINANCE over that luminance's own mean.
Three consequences, all wanted — the mean albedo does not move so nothing re-exposes, the texture's colour
cast divides out so the creator's colour still decides the hue, and what survives is the structure.
Neutrality is true by CONSTRUCTION, because `PROP_TEX_LUM` is the mean of the exact quantity the shader
computes (sRGB-space luminance, THEN decoded) measured on the PNG that ships; `test-1384` re-derives it.

**Triplanar in object space, never UV.** A primitive's UVs run 0..1 per FACE whatever that face's real size
is, so a stretched box stretches the texture — build 1378's 17:1 boundary wall one layer down. `vOdPos` was
already there for the noise, cannot stretch, and stays locked to the object as it moves.

### The sweep that set both numbers

Measured on a SUN-LIT target with build 1379's own term as a positive control:

```
                          unique colours   pixels moved >1
base                          1.000x            0.00%
uOdAlb 1.2 (the control)      1.318x           34.79%   <- it fires
amp 0.35 / density 2          1.027x            5.68%
amp 0.55 / density 2          1.050x            9.72%   <- shipped
amp 0.55 / density 5          1.016x            7.77%
amp 0.90 / density 2          1.088x           15.51%
amp 0.90 / density 5          1.044x           14.14%
control back to 0             0.999x            0.00%
```

0.55 gives twice 1379's frame-wide gain for −0.39% of exposure (1378's standard is 1%). 0.90 nearly doubles
it again, but `mix(1, r, 0.9)` swings albedo 0.19x..2.01x — near black in the crevices and blown at the
peaks, which stops being a modulation and starts being a texture overriding the colour the creator chose.

**DENSITY 2 BEAT DENSITY 5 at both amplitudes**, which is build 1379's pixel-subtense argument for the
third time: the first guess put ~5.6 tiles across the target, whose period is sub-pixel at the range a
level is played at, so it averaged back toward flat.

### The instrument, which cost more than the build

The first attempt was reverted with the note *"it measurably does nothing"*. **That was false**, and the
correction matters more than the feature: the null was measured on a target whose window mean luminance was
**12.3 of 255**. A multiplicative modulation on a surface that renders black produces a fraction of a code
value at any amplitude — the measurement could not have seen it at any setting.

The check that caught it is the one this file already prescribes: **before believing a null, prove the
instrument can produce a positive.** Driving 1379's `uOdAlb` — a term measured working — through the same
rig moved 0.17% of pixels at a 10x amplitude. A positive control that barely fires invalidates every null
taken beside it.

So the target is now chosen on the SUN SIDE (`_sunDir()` decides the camera's side of the prop), the window
is derived by PROJECTING the target's bounding box to screen rather than picked by eye, and the window's
mean luminance is reported before any number beside it is believed. Every "know where the camera is" entry
in this file — 1124, 1151, 1379 — is the same mistake, and those three habits together remove the class.

One pin moved (1379's, which quoted a statement that gained the opt-in on the same line).

## An attempt that did not ship: texture modulation on primitives (after build 1383)

A cold critic scored the stock level **3/10** and a GENERATED arena **6/10** off the same renderer, and named
the difference precisely: the generator gives every piece it builds a real per-material albedo, while the
hand-built level's crates, ramps and pillars are untextured primitives. Build 1379's noise gives them
variation; it cannot give them STRUCTURE — panel lines, brushed grain, wear — which is what reads as a
material. Recorded here because the design is sound, the implementation is NOT, and the next attempt should
not re-derive the parts that are already settled.

**A plain `map` cannot be the answer, and that is the real design constraint.** Build 1378 could compensate
`floorMat`'s base colour because the ENGINE owns it. A primitive's colour is the CREATOR'S, chosen in a
picker, and a map multiplies it — every prop in every level ever saved would have gone ~60% darker.

So the texture has to be a **mean-1.0 MODULATION**: its LUMINANCE divided by that luminance's own mean.
Three consequences, all wanted — the mean albedo does not move so nothing re-exposes, the texture's own
colour cast divides out so the creator's colour still decides the hue, and what survives is the structure.
Neutrality is true by CONSTRUCTION rather than by tuning, because the constant is the mean of the exact
quantity the shader computes: `mean(srgb2lin(luma(texel)))`, measured on the PNG that ships. For
`img/tex/prop-metal.png` (levelgen's `metal` at 256) that is **0.414947**, range 0.042..0.882.

Projection must be **triplanar in object space**, not UV: a primitive's UVs run 0..1 per FACE whatever that
face's real size is, so a stretched box stretches the texture — build 1378's 17:1 boundary wall one layer
down. `vOdPos` is already there for the noise, cannot stretch, and stays locked to the object as it moves.

### CORRECTION: "it measurably does nothing" was WRONG, and the instrument was the reason

That is what this section said first, and it is false. The null was measured on a target whose window mean
luminance was **12.3 of 255** — a near-black surface. An albedo MODULATION is multiplicative, so on a
surface that renders black it produces a fraction of a code value whatever its amplitude. The measurement
could not have seen the effect at any setting.

The check that caught it is the one this file already tells itself to run and I did not: **before believing
a null, prove the instrument can produce a positive.** Driving build 1379's `uOdAlb` — a term MEASURED
working at 1.026x — through the same rig moved only 0.17% of pixels at a 10x amplitude. A positive control
that barely fires invalidates every null taken beside it.

Re-measured on build 1379's own rig (default pose, world-only window, mean luminance 68.5), with that
control included and returning:

```
                        unique colours   pixels moved >1   mean |d|
base                        1.000x            0.00%          0.000
uOdAlb 1.2 (the control)    1.034x            8.25%          0.443   <- it fires
uOdAlb back to 0.30         1.000x            0.62%          0.034   <- and returns
texture modulation 0.55     0.998x            1.00%          0.066
texture modulation 3.0      1.005x            3.94%          0.159   <- above the floor
control back to 0           0.998x            1.18%          0.070
```

**So the mechanism WORKS** — 3.0 is clearly above the control — and the earlier conclusion was an
instrument artifact, not a fact about the shader. What is true is narrower and still disqualifying for
shipping as written: at the shipped 0.55 the effect sits INSIDE the noise floor, so it is not yet worth
three texture fetches per fragment on 52 materials. The open question is amplitude and density, not whether
it functions — and the density is very likely the same pixel-subtense problem build 1379 hit, since at a
gameplay distance ten tiles across a prop that is thirty pixels wide average back to flat.

The next attempt needs a close-up, WELL-LIT target and a sweep of both amplitude and cycles-per-metre. It
does not need to re-litigate whether the patch reaches the frame.

### The original (wrong) reasoning, kept because the elimination work still stands

Verified present, all of it: the block IS in the shader the renderer compiled (read back through
`gl.getShaderSource` — `uOdTexM` found in an 81,795-character program), the texture IS bound
(`_propTexU.value` truthy), 52 of 57 prop materials carry the uniforms, `floorMat` correctly does NOT (it
takes the macro mode and must not pay three extra fetches), 67 programs compiled, `glGetError` 0, zero
shader console output.

And with the camera aimed at a 3 x 4.5 x 14 prop from 2.4 m, the measurement window derived from that
prop's OWN projected screen rect rather than guessed:

```
cond   unique colours   exposure drift   pixels moved >1
amt 0        2042          0.000%             0.00%
amt 0.55     2045         -0.019%             0.00%
amt 3.0      2042         -0.039%             0.00%     <- 5.5x the shipped amplitude
control 0    2044         -0.056%             0.01%     <- drifts MORE than any effect
```

Eliminated on the way: the density (swept 0.7 / 2.5 / 6.0 cycles per metre, all null), the camera distance,
the window, and a **null sampler at program-build time** — the PNG loads asynchronously, so `_propTexU.value`
is null when the first material compiles, which is build 1181's own trap; seeding it with a 1x1 white
DataTexture changed nothing, and white would have made the props 78% brighter if the block were executing.

**That last point is the strongest evidence and the reason for the revert**: a white seed texture makes
`_tl/uOdTexM` a constant 2.41, so `mix(1.0, 2.41, 0.55)` is 1.78 — the props would have been visibly blown
out. They were byte-identical. So the block is compiled into the program and is not affecting the fragment
colour, which is a contradiction I could not resolve inside a reasonable budget.

Shipping it would have cost three texture fetches per fragment on 52 materials for no measured effect. The
design above is worth keeping; the next attempt should start by proving a *deliberately absurd* constant
multiply on `diffuseColor` at that same patch site reaches the frame at all, before adding any sampling.

### The instrument failures, because four of five runs were the rig and not the engine

| # | it reported | why |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 0.53% effect against a 0.65% control | the props in the window were 20-40 m away and `PROP_TEX_PER_M = 0.7` is a 1.43 m period — less than ONE cycle across a 1 m crate, so each crate got a near-flat multiplier. Build 1379's pixel-subtense lesson, inverted |
| 2 | a 9x amplitude measured identical | the probe was a NEW page session and never aimed the camera, so the props were distant again |
| 3 | NaN over the viewmodel window | the probe renders at **640x360**, not the 900x506 `shot.mjs` uses, so the coordinates ran off the end of the image |
| 4 | — | the fix for all three: aim in the SAME session, and derive the window by PROJECTING the target's bounding box to screen rather than picking pixels by eye |

#4 is the durable part. Every earlier failure in this file's log that reads "know where the camera is"
(1124), "read WHO before attributing anything to a surface" (1151) or "the probe never posed the camera"
(1379) is the same mistake, and projecting the target's own bbox removes the whole class.

## The relief fades with the antialiasing that covers it (build 1383)

The third of the critic's verified findings. Builds 1145 and 1379 perturb the normal with a hashed field at
~34 cycles across a mesh — high frequency by design, because that is what breaks a flat facet. But
high-frequency NORMAL noise is specular aliasing waiting to happen: it needs antialiasing to resolve it,
and antialiasing is the first thing the adaptive ladder throws away. Build 1126 already MEASURED the
replacement — a 1.02-pixel MSAA coverage gradient on 100 of 100 scanlines becomes a hard edge on 94 of 99
under FXAA — so on the rung where the frame can least resolve the noise, the noise was unchanged and the
resolution was lower as well. It outran its own cover.

`_OD_BUMP_STEP` is `[1.0, 0.6, 0.4, 0.25]`. **Rung 0 is exactly 1.0**, so no frame anybody has ever seen at
full quality moves. It is ONE shared uniform object handed to every patched material BY REFERENCE (build
1181's mechanism), so a rung change is a single CPU write and never a recompile, hooked into
`_applyPixelRatio` — which already means "the rung moved" and is called on every downshift, every climb and
the adaptive-off restore, so there is no second list of call sites (build 1350 established that hook).

**The ALBEDO term is deliberately not faded.** It runs at ~0.9 cycles per metre (1379's pixel-subtense
derivation), a ~1.1 m period — nowhere near the sampling limit at any rung, so it does not alias and fading
it would only remove variation.

**The TDZ, caught by the boot test on the first draft.** `_applyPixelRatio()` is CALLED at boot, ~2,500
lines above `OBJ_DETAIL_BUMP`, and the first version read the constant from inside the sync behind a
`typeof` guard — which does **not** guard a temporal dead zone. Builds 1127, 1331 and 1350 each lost
something to exactly that, and this file's own comment acknowledging the trap was written directly above
the line that fell into it. The base is HANDED OVER at the constant's declaration site instead, which also
means the literal is written once and cannot drift from the fade.

### What this build does NOT claim, and why

**No measured visual improvement.** Two honest reasons, and the second is the more useful one:

- Specular aliasing is a **motion artifact** — it reads as crawl and shimmer as the camera moves — and a
  still capture cannot contain it. This is a case where the frame is the wrong instrument by nature.
- Probed live: the stock level has **`full: 0`** relief-patched materials. All 67 patched materials carry
  the ALBEDO-only mode; the relief term's consumers are UV-less IMPORTS (the weapon, low-poly packs), and
  none was on screen. So there was nothing in frame for the measurement to move.

What IS verified, executed and live: all 67 materials hold the same shared object, the ladder moves it
0.35 / 0.21 / 0.14 / 0.0875 across the four desktop rungs and restores, and rung 0 returns the authored
value exactly.

### Three instrument failures, and the first two are the same one twice

| # | it reported | why |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | fading changed 0.1% against a control drift of 0.004 pts — a clean null | nothing in the window carried the relief patch. Every stock surface takes the albedo-only path, which SKIPS the normal patch entirely |
| 2 | a **9x** amplitude measured identical to the shipped one | same cause — and I only noticed because the probe was changed to report the READBACK rather than the value I had passed in. It had never confirmed the write took |
| 3 | the viewmodel window read NaN | the probe renders at **640x360**, not the 900x506 `shot.mjs` uses, so the coordinates were off the end of the image — and there is no weapon in that frame anyway |

**#2 is the rule worth carrying**: a probe that echoes its own input tells you nothing. Report what the
engine HOLDS, not what you asked it to hold. And #1/#3 are build 1124's rule for the third time in this
session — know what is in the frame before attributing anything to it.

## The macro layer, and the frames that were judged without a texture (build 1382)

A cold rendering critic scored the engine **3/10 vs AAA** and its blind verdict named ONE tell: *"regular,
unbroken texture tiling on the two largest surfaces in frame."* Verified, and it is an interaction between
the two builds before it — **1378 and 1379 excluded each other from the surfaces that most needed both.**
1378 gave the ground and boundary walls a real albedo at a 4 m tile; `albedoDetailWanted` refuses a
material that has a `map`, so 1379's break-up layer then skipped them. The result was the worst of the
three states: a small tile pasted flat, edge to edge, ~35 times across 140 m, with nothing on top of it.

1379's gate was right about what it was written for — two detail systems at the SAME scale is double grain
— and that reason does not cover a MACRO layer, which runs at several times the tile period and breaks the
repeat rather than competing with the texture's own frequency.

**The period is derived from the thing it hides, and must not be an integer multiple of it.** `MACRO_TILE_MUL
= 2.75` against `SURF_TILE_M`: an integer multiple lands on the tile boundary every period and *strengthens*
the repeat, which is the opposite of the point.

**The frequency semantics are NOT the primitive path's, and this is the trap the build was specified around.**
`_albDetailFreq(span) = ALB_DETAIL_PER_M x span` assumes a UNIT local box scaled by the object. `floorMat`'s
plane is a real `PlaneGeometry(ARENA*2, ARENA*2)` and a boundary wall is `BoxGeometry(ARENA*2, H, 2)` —
neither is scaled — so `vOdPos` spans 140 m and the frequency there is `1 / period`. The primitive form
would have been ~1000x off, and would have looked like nothing happening rather than like an error.

### The amplitude, measured — and the first guess was sub-threshold

World-only window, world paused, control returning to exactly zero at every threshold:

```
              >1      >2      >3      >4      >6      >9     (code values moved)
control      0.0%    0.0%    0.0%    0.0%    0.0%    0.0%
0.13        10.3%    5.6%    1.8%    0.6%    0.0%    0.0%
0.30        14.8%   11.5%    9.1%    7.1%    3.4%    0.8%
```

0.13 was the first guess and it is **sub-threshold**: almost all of it is one to three code values, which
cannot break a tile a viewer can see. Coverage barely grows above it (15.7% -> 19.2% of pixels touched), so
what is bought above 0.13 is AMPLITUDE — which is the thing that actually hides a repeat. 0.30 is also,
independently, where build 1379's sweep put the knee for the same kind of term.

### Chain, never clobber — and the probe is what found it

`applyObjDetail` ASSIGNED over `mat.onBeforeCompile`. Harmless for the UV-less imports 1145 wrote it for
(they carry no other patch) and not harmless the moment it met `floorMat`, which has had its own handler for
the paint splat since build 1139. Probed: **the floor came back UNPATCHED while the wall patched**, because
the splat is assigned 500 lines further down and simply won. Build 1286 recorded this exact rule for the
bake's patch and it never reached here.

So the handler chains its predecessor (guarded by `hasOwnProperty`, not truthiness — three declares a no-op
on the PROTOTYPE, so a truthiness test chains three's own empty function forever), inside a `try`, and the
program cache key COMPOSES: a material carrying both patches compiles a different program from one carrying
only this, and a single key would serve one of them the other's shader. The floor's call also moved below
the splat's assignment, because chaining only helps the patch that runs second.

### Every frame between 1378 and 1382 was judged on a ground with no albedo on it

`tools/probe/mkprobe.mjs` staged `breach.html` and the vendored scripts and **not `img/`**. The stock floor
and wall textures are served at a path relative to the game, so they 404'd, `_loadSurfaceMap`'s error branch
left `floorMat.map` NULL, and nothing errored. The probe reported `floorHasMap: false` — on a build whose
whole subject was that texture.

That silently invalidates the visual half of builds 1378-1381's verification. What survives untouched is
everything measured in Node against the real files (1378's compensation is re-derived from the shipped PNGs,
1379's neutrality from the shipped GLSL, 1380's scale from the real shadow camera) and 1380's shadow
measurement, which does not involve those maps. **A capture rig that stages an incomplete copy of the game
does not fail — it quietly photographs a different game.**

## The level check never asked whether the level could be won (build 1423)

Level Check has reported lights, texture memory, missing models, third-party hosts, locks without keys and
the graph's own last-run failures for a long time. It said **nothing about the one setting that decides
whether the level can be finished at all** — and three of the eight objective modes are silently unwinnable
when under-authored. None of the three announces itself in play:

| mode | why it cannot be won | what the player sees |
|---|---|---|
| **destroy** | the win test is `_destroyTotal>0 && remain<=0` | the HUD reads `NO TARGETS SET` and the run has no ending |
| **puzzle** | nothing spawns and `objectiveTick` has **no puzzle branch** — an authored win action is the only exit | a walking simulator |
| **race** | with no Start-line piece `_raceStartO` is null | the lap never arms and the race HUD hides itself |

**Runtime spawning cannot rescue the Destroy case, which is why it is a hard statement rather than a
guess:** `_setupDestroyTargets` runs once at deploy, so a level that starts with zero usable targets stays
at zero however many the graph spawns later.

### `goto` counts as a win path, and that decision is load-bearing

A campaign room whose exit is a doorway (build 1394) is finished by loading the next one. Treating only
`win` as an ending would have fired this row on **every room of a multi-room game** — which is exactly the
shape this engine now encourages, and exactly what the gauntlet being built against it is made of. A false
positive on the commonest structure would have trained the panel out of being read.

The Destroy check also reports the *mixed* case — targets marked but unusable while others work — as a
**clickable** row (build 1300), because there is a specific prop to go and fix. The level-wide cases have
nothing to point at and stay plain, which is 1300's own rule.

**Five modes are deliberately never mentioned.** `eliminate`, `survival`, `extraction`, `defend` and
`escort` all provision themselves, and a panel that always complains is not read (1274). The test asserts
their ABSENCE rather than trusting it.

### The first draft wrote markup into a text node

The rows were written with `<b>` around every control name — and `renderLevelIssues` sets `d.textContent =
msg`. It would have printed literal `<b>` tags in the panel. `textContent` is not an oversight there and
must not be "fixed": other rows interpolate level-authored strings (key names, audio-zone names, hostnames
— builds 1325 and 1335), so markup in a message is a stored-XSS shaped hole. Caught by reading the renderer
before believing the writer, and `test-1423` now pins both halves — the renderer sets text, and these rows
carry no markup.

**And the probe measured the PANEL, not just the check.** `levelIssues()` returning the right string and
the creator being able to read it are two different claims; the first draft's markup bug lives entirely in
the gap between them. The panel row needed the editor opened and switched to the Save tab first, because
build 1293 does not build a section that is not on screen.

Measured (`tools/probe/objective-check.mjs`, 13/13), with a correctly authored level of the same mode as
the control at every step:

```
destroy, nothing marked    reported, naming NO TARGETS SET
destroy, one real target   SILENT                                  <- the control
destroy, unbreakable only  reported as unusable (build 1421)
destroy, one good one bad  the unusable one only, and clickable
puzzle, no win path        reported · a win node / goto / signal each silence it
race, no start line        reported
eliminate/survival/extraction/defend/escort   silent on a bare level
rendered panel             1 row, as prose, no literal tags
```

One pin moved (1300), which counts how many rows are CLICKABLE — seven to eight. That count is worth
keeping exactly rather than loosening: it is what stops a future build making every row clickable, and this
build's own rule is that a level-wide issue with nowhere to send you stays a plain row.

## The Destroy mission could not see the targets (build 1422)

Found by sweeping for siblings of 1421 rather than waiting for a report, and it is the **fifth** arrival of
build 1392's defect. `_setupDestroyTargets` walked `dynamicProps` — and build 1390's static shootable target
is not in that list.

Every other part of the chain was already right, which is exactly what made it invisible: the editor offers
the **Objective target** checkbox on a static target, `propEntry` writes `obj:1` for it, and build 1398
taught the loader to restore it in the damageable tier. So the flag was authored, saved, reloaded — and the
one function that consumes it never looked. **A range whose targets are all bolted-down plates reads
`NO TARGETS SET` and can never be won.**

```
                       before          after
props carrying `objective`   3               3
tracked by the mission       1 (crate)       2 (crate, plate)
an UNBREAKABLE objective     not tracked     not tracked
```

The fix is `damageableProps()`, and that is the whole point of 1392 making it a function rather than three
inline conditions: the repair is to ask the thing that already answers *"which props can be hurt"*.

**The `breakable` term is not symmetry.** An objective that can never be destroyed makes the mission
**unwinnable**, which is a worse failure than not counting it — and build 1421 had just made an unbreakable
prop take hits forever, so a creator unticking Breakable on a marked target would have locked the level. One
build creating the hazard the next must close, two hours apart, for the second time this stretch (1390/1391).

### A passing check that passed for the wrong reason

The probe's *"an unbreakable objective is NOT tracked"* row was **green before the fix** — because the wall
was static, so the `dynamicProps` walk excluded it for a reason that had nothing to do with `breakable`. It
is green after the fix for the intended reason. That is the vacuous-pass family this file records under
builds 1316 and 1390 (*before believing a null, prove the instrument can produce a positive*), in its
quieter form: **a green check on a fixture the code rejects for an unrelated reason is not evidence.** The
only thing that distinguished them was the control beside it moving.

`test-1422` executes the real set-up loop over props of both kinds with `damageableProps` supplied as the
real predicate, so it tests the ROUTING rather than a copy of it — build 1277's rule. One pin moved (218), which quoted the two terms ADJACENTLY and broke when the new one landed between them, with every part of what it meant still true — the same neighbourhood-quoting trap this file records for character budgets and whole-list literals, in its narrowest form yet: two conditions with an `&&` between them.

### And I did it to this file, with a `sed`

The one-line note above was appended with an unanchored `sed 's|Zero pins moved\.|...|'` — a phrase that
appears in **more than one entry**, so it also rewrote build 1367's. Caught by `grep -c` returning 2 for a
replacement that should have been unique, and reverted by line number. The scripted-edit convention this
file prescribes for source (assert the match count, write atomically) exists for exactly this and I did not
apply it to prose. **A bare-phrase replacement is only as safe as that phrase is unique — including in
documentation, where boilerplate sentences repeat by design.**

## The checkbox that turned the target off by asking for it (build 1421)

Reported from play, one message after the shooting-range loop first worked end to end: *"if you don't also
have Breakable toggled on, it doesn't work."*

`damageProp` opened `if(obj.userData.breakable===false) return false;`. So unticking **Breakable** did not
stop the plate SHATTERING — it stopped the plate REGISTERING: no health change, no impact flash, no hit
sound, and no `damaged` signal, which is build 1397's entire feature. And the label beside it reads
*"shatters when shot"*, so **a creator who wants the one thing a shooting range is made of — score every
hit, the plate never disappears — switches their target off by asking for it.**

**Five call sites read the flag and all five treated it as immunity**: `damageProp`, `playPropHitSound`,
both `explodeAt` sweeps, and the restore. It is now ONE rule — *never BREAKS* — read once into a local and
gating exactly three things: the health, the shatter, and the fuse.

### It is build 1405's narrowing taken one step further

That build moved `breakable:false` from *"skip the prop entirely"* to *"cannot be damaged"* so an
unbreakable crate beside a grenade still goes flying. This moves it to *"cannot be DESTROYED"*, which is
what the label has said all along. The health **never drops** rather than draining to a death that can
never arrive — the truthful reading of invulnerable, and it keeps `#hpf` at 1 for a graph that reads it.

**Nothing that works today regresses, and that is checkable rather than hopeful:** a `brk:false` prop could
never fire `damaged`, so no level can be relying on it; the flash and the hit sound are feedback on a prop
that used to eat shots in silence. The serializer is untouched (`brk:false` is still written only when off).

**The fuse is gated too, and that one is not symmetry.** Igniting is how a fused explosive destroys itself,
so an unbreakable one must never light — otherwise "cannot be destroyed" would be defeated by the one
branch that returns before the damage.

### Measured, with the same plate as its own control

`tools/probe/unbreakable-target.mjs` — two plates identical but for the one flag, each wired the way a
creator wires one: prop signal `On hit` → `→ Logic event` → `On event` → `Change variable score +1`.

```
                    unbreakable                       breakable (control)
before   3 hits     score 0   hp 100  no flash        score 3   hp 70   flash
         +30 hits   score 0   hp 100  standing        score 33  shattered
         a grenade  score 0                           —
after    3 hits     score 3   hp 100  flash           score 3   hp 70   flash        <- control byte-identical
         +30 hits   score 33  hp 100  STILL STANDING  score 33  shattered
         a grenade  score 1   not destroyed
```

The control is what makes it a finding rather than a broken instrument: a run where neither plate scores is
the rig, and a run where only the unbreakable one fails is the defect.

### The untick now says what it does

The trap was never the checkbox, it was its **absence of a stated consequence** — it reads as "does not
shatter" and meant "takes no damage at all". A hint under it names all three things that still fire and the
case it is for. A control whose consequence is invisible is one nobody can use on purpose (1348's rule).

### A pin defeated by prose THREE TIMES in one build

Once in my own new test (`!/breakable/` matched `playPropHitSound`'s own comment about *"every breakable
prop in its radius"*), and once in the moved `test-1390` pin (`!/breakable===false\) return false;/` matched
this build's comment **quoting the line it had just deleted**). Builds 164, 1393, 1395, 1411 and 1412 all
record this in one direction or the other, and it is now unambiguous: **a pin must match a real STATEMENT —
`obj.userData.breakable===false`, not the bare phrase — because the most likely thing to collide with a
source pin is the build's own documentation of what it removed.**

Six pins moved (1305, 1390 ×4, 1405, 482, 340, and my own). Two of them had their assertions **inverted**
rather than restated, because both were pinning a consequence of the defect: test-1305's *"an unbreakable
prop is silent"* and test-1390's *"an explicit `breakable:false` still refuses everything"*.

## The feature shipped switched on and inert (build 1392)

Reported from play, against build 1390, with a screenshot of the panel filled in correctly: *"This isn't
working. The prop never breaks."*

Build 1390 taught `damageProp` that a static prop can opt in with `shootable`, and **stopped there.** Nothing
that FIRES resolves a prop through that gate:

| | how it resolved a prop |
|---|---|
| the bullet | walked the hit object's parents looking for `userData.phys` |
| the turret | did the same |
| **melee** | was **gated on `dynamicProps.length`** *and* **raycast `dynamicProps`** |

So all three looked straight past a static target. The checkbox was ticked, the HP was set, and the plate was
immortal — **build 1277's defect, committed by me four builds after writing the test that exists to catch it.**
1390's own probe walked past it too, by calling `damageProp` directly instead of firing a shot.

`_isDamageable(o)` is now the one question, asked at all three sites, and `damageableProps()` is the set —
dynamic props plus static targets, into a **reused array** (1168), because a swing runs it.

**The melee half needed THREE changes and the first draft made one.** Routing only the arc scan through the
new set left the block gated on `dynamicProps.length` and raycasting `dynamicProps`, so a swing still found
nothing to test and the reported symptom survived the fix. `test-1392` asserts the block contains **zero**
occurrences of `dynamicProps` — counting the absence, because any one of the three surviving keeps the bug.

### Four instrument failures, and only the control caught two of them

Measured on a static target with a **dynamic control beside it** and a plain static prop as a negative control:

```
BULLET   30 -> 15 -> 0, shattered, invisible
MELEE    static 60 damage   ·   dynamic control 60 damage
BLAST    static 106         ·   dynamic control 104      (the difference is the distance falloff)
CONTROL  a plain static wall keeps all 50 HP through three rifle rounds and a swing,
         and is not in damageableProps() at all
```

| # | it reported | why |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | melee 0 on the target **and 0 on the dynamic control** | read hp synchronously after `meleeAttack`. Build 1303 split the swing from the contact — the blow lands on a 160 ms windup timer |
| 2 | melee 0 on the target, control fine | the target had been **destroyed by the bullet test above it**, and I hand-poked `_shattered`/`_destroyed` back to false instead of calling build 1391's own `_restoreDestroyedProp` |
| 3 | blast 0 on the target, 100 on the control | the blast was at distance **exactly 0** from the target's origin, and both sweeps guard `d>0.01` so an exploding barrel cannot damage itself |
| 4 | a syntax error in the probe | a backtick inside a comment inside a template literal — **sixth time this session** (1328, 1342, 1357) |

**#1 is the one that mattered.** A null in the control is the instrument, not the feature, and without the
control I would have gone hunting a melee bug that did not exist. Build 1316 paid for that rule three times;
this is the fourth.

Two pins moved (1295, 1311), both anchored on `if(dynamicProps.length){`. Their assertions were all still true
— and **`indexOf` returning −1 makes `slice(-1)` hand back the LAST CHARACTER rather than failing**, so a
drifted anchor tests an empty block and passes on nothing. Both now assert the anchor was found.

## Four builds of detail with no way off (build 1393)

Reported from play, in the same message as 1392's defect: *"There needs to be a way to remove the default
material and texture of primitives. The user may want just a solid color primitive without texture or
materials, and right now there is no way to do that."*

Verified, and it is four builds deep. `primitiveMat()` calls `applyProcSurface(mat, 1, true)`, which hands
every shape:

| build | what it adds | how |
|---|---|---|
| 1139 | procedural relief + roughness variation | `PROC_SLOTS` — real texture slots |
| 1379 | an albedo noise term | `uOdAlb` |
| 1384 | a triplanar texture modulation | `uOdTex` / `uOdTexA` |
| 1388 | relief derived from that same sample | `uOdTexN` |

Every one of those was retrofitted onto colours creators had already chosen, every one is exposure-neutral
by construction, and every one was **right about the default**. None of them asked whether the default should
be the only option — so four builds later the answer to "I want the flat colour I picked" was: you cannot
have it. **A default nobody can turn off is not a default, it is a constraint**, and this file's own argument
for each of those builds (*"this can be retrofitted onto colours creators already chose"*) is exactly the
argument for letting them decline it.

### It could not be an un-patch, and that decided the shape

`uOdBump` and `uOdTexN` are shared **by reference** — they carry the adaptive ladder's fade (1383), so there
is no per-material value to zero. And removing `onBeforeCompile` recompiles every material in the batch. So
the switch is ONE per-material uniform, `uOdOn`, multiplied into all six amplitude sites, plus the two real
map slots cleared. A uniform write is free and reaches the live frame; the map slots flip a `#define` and
recompile, which is fine because **this is an editor action and the editor is not play** (the rule builds
636/977/1153/1155 wrote for lights).

It is read **from the material**, not from `shader.uniforms`: a prop is marked plain at SPAWN, long before
its first render, and a uniform written before its shader exists is a write to nothing (1379).

**`test-1393` counts the ungated uses rather than listing the gated ones.** Missing one site leaves a term
plain cannot turn off — which is precisely what build 1392 shipped three days earlier with three resolution
sites and one changed.

### Where this would have leaked, and it is build 1324's defect in a mirror

`applyPropTexture`'s clear branch restores `_procFallback(m, slot)` — so clearing a texture on a plain prop
would have put the detail straight back, **with the flag set, correctly serialized, and every source pin
passing.** That is build 1324's `noCol` verbatim: an opt-out expressed as an absence loses to a fallback
designed to fail closed.

So `_procFallback` itself answers `null` for a plain material. It is the ONE point every restore path goes
through — this one, the floor-texture path, and whatever a future build adds — so the opt-out cannot be
lost to a caller nobody has written yet. The one function that must NOT ask it is `applyPropPlain`, which
would then never find the maps it is trying to clear; it reads the remembered set directly, and the test
asserts the absence of the *call*, not of the name.

### Measured, with a control that returns

Pinned top rung, paused, grain and auto-exposure off, on an 8x8 box face whose window was derived by
projection and then confirmed by reading WHO the renderer drew there:

```
                 unique colours     mean
DETAILED               3,785      37,59,44
PLAIN                  2,134      37,59,45
DETAILED (control)     3,795      37,59,44      returns to 1.003x
```

**The mean holding to one code value is the corroboration that matters.** 1379's term is exposure-neutral by
construction, so switching it off must move the *variation* and not the *brightness* — and it does exactly
that. 2,134 is still a lot of colours because the surface is LIT: a flat albedo is not a flat pixel, and the
checkbox does not promise one.

The instancing batch carries it: 2 distinct `_instKey`s, and the plain pair forms its **own** `InstancedMesh`
with no normal map and `_odOn` 0. Without the key change a batch clones ONE member's material and whichever
sorted first would give its surface to both.

### Two instrument failures, both reading as "the feature does nothing"

1. **Drawing the canvas into a 2D context returned mean `[0,0,0]` and ONE unique colour in every condition,
   control included.** `preserveDrawingBuffer` is false — build 1344's lesson #3. The control is the only
   reason that read as an instrument fault rather than as a null.
2. With that fixed, the effect measured **0.6% against a control that drifted 1.6%**. The window was on
   **sky**: the prop had been swept into an `InstancedMesh` at deploy and was not in the scene at all, so
   editing its material reached nothing drawn — while every state readout (`nrm:false`, `odOn:0`,
   `uniform:0`) stayed perfectly correct. **Build 1151's "read WHO before attributing anything to a
   surface", for the fourth time**, and the first time it has been about a prop rather than a floor.

And a third, in the test rather than the probe: the pin asserting `applyPropPlain` does not call
`_procFallback` was written as a bare name and **matched the comment inside `applyPropPlain` explaining why
it does not call it.** A pin must not be satisfiable by prose — this file records the same trap under build
164 and it is now three sessions old.

Seven pins moved (1145 x2, 1379, 1382, 1384, 1388 x2), every one a GLSL literal that gained the multiply,
every assertion unchanged in intent.

## A doorway between levels, not a level select (build 1394)

Asked for from use: *"is there a way to trigger the next level? I think it could be useful to break out
large rooms or levels into separate json files. There could be a trigger that when the player walks into a
certain zone, it shows a 'loading...' message and then picks up the game with the newly loaded scene.
Half-Life and Portal do this regularly."*

The transition itself has existed since build 1352 — a trigger zone fires an event, an event node pulses a
`goto` node, `goto` loads a campaign level. Checked against the level-CLEAR path (`gameWon`) before building
anything, and it already had two of the three things that make room-splitting *work* rather than merely
function:

| | clear path | `goto` before this build |
|---|---|---|
| weapons / ammo / HP | `_captureLoadout` → `_restoreLoadout` | **nothing** |
| a transition card | `showCampaignInterstitial` | it explicitly CLEARS one |
| where you arrive | n/a | always the destination's own spawn |

So walking through a door reset your guns and health to whatever the next room's loadout happened to be, and
put you at its spawn point rather than at the matching door. **A hub world wants exactly that; a room split
out of one level does not** — which is why the loadout carry is a FLAG (`keep`) and not a behaviour change,
and why a node authored before this build is byte-identical.

### The landmark is a TAG

Half-Life solves the arrival with landmark entities. Here the landmark is a tag, which every prop already
carries and every other place-taking verb already resolves — so a creator places a marker, rotates it to
face into the room, and types its tag. **The marker's own facing IS the arrival facing**: player yaw and a
prop's `rotation.y` share the engine's −Z forward, so it is the identity mapping rather than a conversion.

Three decisions:
- **The FIRST prop with the tag wins**, deliberately unlike `_lgPlaceAt`, which picks at random so a spawned
  squad scatters. An arrival is one place; a random one is a different door on every visit.
- **`at` has NO datalist.** The tags a dropdown could offer are the ones in the level being EDITED, and the
  marker is in the DESTINATION. Autocompleting a creator into a tag that does not exist there is worse than
  offering none, so an unresolved tag is REPORTED at run time (1214's channel) instead.
- **An arrival outranks a saved checkpoint**, for the same reason build 1224's test pose does: a graph that
  named a door has named a place, and a checkpoint from a previous visit must not quietly override it.

### Two call sites, because one would serve half the markers

A marker built from a PRIMITIVE is in the scene when `startGame` ends — `spawnProp` calls its builder
synchronously — so the common case lands before a frame is ever drawn. A marker that is an imported model is
still in flight. So `_arriveApply()` runs at the end of `startGame` AND in `reveal()`, is idempotent by
consuming its own request, and reports by name if the second attempt still cannot find the tag.

### The forced cover, and the deadlock it would have been

`startGame` only raises the loader `if(_levelAssetsPending())`, so a room-to-room transition with everything
already cached was a hard cut with no feedback at all. `_loadCover` forces it — **through the same
`showLevelLoader(); waitAssetsThenReveal();` pair**, and that is load-bearing: `showLevelLoader()` alone
would leave the screen up FOREVER, because the reveal is the only thing that takes it down and startGame's
later intro-cover block skips when the loader is already active. `waitAssetsThenReveal` also supplies the
beat for free — its 240 ms zero-grace is a natural minimum rather than an invented delay.

The label names the destination (`Entering Reactor Hall…`), as `textContent`, because a level name is level
data (1325).

### Measured live, on a real two-room campaign

```
PLAIN goto      Reactor Hall, spawn (0, 2.9, 30), hp 100, owned [rifle], mag 30
                cover up reading "Entering Reactor Hall", then down      <- pre-1394 behaviour + the beat
SEAMLESS goto   (120, 1.70, -80) = the marker at (120, 0, -80) + EYE, yaw -1.571 = the marker's own facing
                hp 43 carried, mag 7 carried, owned [pistol, rifle] carried
                landed IMMEDIATELY, in startGame, before a frame was drawn
BAD TAG         the level's own spawn, and Level Check reads the tag by name
GUARDS          out of range / zero / not-in-a-campaign all refuse; nothing armed, no cover left behind
```

**The probe's first run reported every transition doing nothing.** `_lgPulse(id, pin)` takes an ID and
resolves it out of `logicGraph.nodes`; I passed a node OBJECT, so it returned at its first line. A probe that
drives the wrong signature is indistinguishable from a feature that does not work — and build 1352's own
entry says the reason it drives the real switch is that `goto` once shipped into the wrong dispatcher.

**Seven pins moved**, five of them the one loader-gate line. The seventh is build 1352's own, and it is the
**character-budget trap again**: `pulse.slice(indexOf("case 'goto':"), indexOf(...) + 1600)`. This build added
~1,200 characters to that case and pushed two assertions off the end **with both still true**. It ends on the
next `case` now.

### Still open, and stated rather than implied

The transition is host/solo only (1352's guard, unchanged) — in co-op a client does not follow the host
through a door, and that needs a level-change message of its own. And a *seamless* transition in the
Half-Life sense — no cover at all, the next room streamed in behind you — is a different build; this one
shows a beat, because the engine tears the scene down and rebuilds it.

## The target kept wearing the hit (build 1395)

Reported from play: *"when a prop is set as something you can blow up/break (target practice style), when it
reloads the prop, the prop has a red tint to it."*

`damageProp` paints a 140 ms orange impact flash — `0x661a00` at intensity 0.8 — and stamps
`userData._flash`. `updateFragments` decays it, **by walking `dynamicProps`.** Build 1390's static shootable
target is not in that list, so the flash was set on every hit and nothing ever cleared it: a 140 ms effect
became permanent, and build 1391's reset brought the target back still wearing it.

**This is build 1392's defect for the FOURTH time.** That build found three consumers of *"which props can be
hurt"* still asking the dynamic list — the bullet walk, the turret walk, the melee block — and put them
behind one predicate. This is the fourth, and it is exactly why `damageableProps()` is a function rather
than three inline conditions: the fix is to call the thing that already answers the question.

The restore also clears the flash outright, which is not redundant — the decay only runs while the prop is
alive, and a target that shattered *mid-flash* is invisible with the tint still on it.

Measured with a DYNAMIC prop beside the target as the control, because a static target that cleared while
the control did not would mean the probe rather than the fix:

```
STATIC    before #000000 @0  ->  hit #661a00 @0.8  ->  6 frames on #000000 @0
DYNAMIC   before #000000 @0  ->  hit #661a00 @0.8  ->  6 frames on #000000 @0     (identical)
REPORT    destroyed mid-flash (#661a00, invisible) -> reset -> #000000 @0, flash cleared, hp 500/500
GLOW      an authored #38f5b5 @3 survives hit -> destroy -> reset and comes back as itself
```

The setup row is the other half of the argument: `staticInDyn: false, inDamageable: true` — the target was
outside the list the decay used to walk and is inside the one it walks now.

**And the test's first draft was failed by my own comment.** It counted the bare name `dynamicProps` in the
decay block, which the comment explaining what it *used to* walk satisfies. A pin must not be satisfiable by
prose and must not be defeatable by prose either; it asserts the LOOP now. Third sighting — builds 164 and
1393 record the same trap.

## A pickup can be taken once and stay taken (build 1396)

Reported from play: *"there needs to be an option for spawned pickups that it doesn't keep respawning after
the item has been picked up. Right now it just infinitely keeps popping back up after a little bit."*

Correct — every pad but a key or an inventory item returned on `POWERUP_COOLDOWN` forever, with no per-spot
control. A health pad in a corridor is right to come back; the shotgun hidden at the end of a puzzle room is
not, and there was no way to say which.

**The one-shot rule already existed — as `p.cd = 1e9`, a cooldown of thirty-one years, written out at BOTH
grant sites.** A sentinel standing in for a fact, duplicated, in exactly the shape this file records as
drifting (1266, 1272, 1280). So most of this build is deleting duplication that was already there:
`_puOnce(p)` is the predicate, `_puConsume(p)` is the one writer of a pad's taken state, and `gone` is a real
flag rather than a countdown that still ticked every frame of every match for a pad that could never return.

Three decisions:
- **Once per RUN, not once forever.** `gone` lives on the live pad and `spawnPowerups` rebuilds those every
  deploy — the same scope the key ring has always had. The label says so (*"does not respawn this run"*),
  because "once" alone reads as *never again, ever*.
- **A key or an item shows the box TICKED AND DISABLED**, not hidden. A control that vanishes for some kinds
  reads as a bug (1348), and one that is unticked while the pad demonstrably never returns is a lie (1338).
- **An unknown kind falls through to respawning.** A pad that silently never returns is the harder failure to
  diagnose than one that comes back when you did not expect it.

Measured with a RESPAWNING pad beside the one-shot in every run, because a one-shot that stays gone while
the control also stays gone would mean the clock and not the flag:

```
_puOnce over three pads      [true, false, true]     (authored, ordinary, key)
just taken     gone [true, false, true], all three hidden
20 s later     the ORDINARY pad is back and visible; the one-shot and the key are not
220 s later    unchanged — it is not a longer timer, it never returns
redeploy       all three ready and visible again
round trip     `once:1` written for the authored pad alone
```

Two test faults of my own, both the same shape and both worth the line: a count of `_puConsume(p)` matched
the **definition** as well as the two calls, and build 1395's count of `dynamicProps` was satisfied by the
**comment** explaining what the code used to walk. A pin that counts a bare name counts prose and
declarations too.

Four harnesses moved (237, 451, 470, 80). Two of them quoted the `1e9` sentinel to mean *"a key never comes
back"* — they **execute `_puOnce`** now, with an ordinary pad as the control, which is what they always meant
and is immune to how the rule happens to be spelled.

## The target could not report the shot (build 1397)

Found by asking what the gauntlet's first booth — a shooting range — actually needs, and checking rather
than assuming. A prop could signal exactly three things:

```
destroyed · interacted · contact
```

**There is no "on hit".** So a plate could only ever score by being DESTROYED — which is the precise opposite
of what builds 1390 (a target that stays bolted down) and 1391 (a target that comes back) exist for. Those
two builds made a target shootable repeatedly and resettable, and it could not report a single one of those
shots. "Hit the plate, +1" was unbuildable, and it is the first thing a range needs.

**The bridge to the graph was already there** — the `emit` signal verb (build 1027) fires a named logic event
that an `On event` node picks up. What was missing was a trigger, so this build is one new `when` value plus
the payload the prop events never had.

Three decisions:
- **It fires on EVERY landed hit, including the lethal one.** The killing shot IS a hit, and `destroyed` is a
  different question that fires beside it. A range scoring one point per hit must not silently drop the last
  one. A shotgun's eight pellets are eight hits, correctly, and the graph's own 400-pulse budget bounds it.
- **After the damage lands, before the shatter branch**, so `#hp` and `#hpf` describe the prop as the player
  just left it. Firing first would report the health it had before the shot.
- **Host/solo only**, exactly like `destroyed`. A client's shot reaches the host as `propHit`; firing on both
  sides would double every score in co-op.

### The payload, and why `destroyed` got it too

Build 1221 gave the enemy events `#x / #z / #hp / #hpf` and the PROP events never got them, so a graph could
be told *a plate was hit* and could not ask where, or how hard. `_lgPropEvent(o, when, ctx)` sets the payload
around the fire and unwinds it in a `finally` — 1221's exact shape.

Both prop events go through it. Carrying a payload on one and not the other is the inconsistency this file
keeps recording, and **it changes nothing that works today**: `#here` in a destroyed-chain resolved to NULL,
and a verb handed a null place does nothing and reports it (1214), so no working level can be relying on it.

`when` is stored as `s.w` and round-trips verbatim — there is no allow-list of trigger names anywhere, which
is why this build touches neither loader. Asserted rather than assumed: a sanitizer that silently dropped an
unknown `when` would make this a feature that works until you save.

### Measured through the WHOLE chain, not its ends

Build 1277 found six verbs that had shipped and never worked because only the ends were pinned. So the probe
drives a real shot → `damageProp` → the `damaged` signal → `emit` → `logicEvent` → an `On event` node → Math
nodes reading the payload:

```
fresh               score 0                     hp 60/60
1 rifle shot        score 1   #hpf 0.75         hp 45
3 shots             score 3   #hpf 0.25         hp 15
4th (LETHAL)        score 4   AND downs 1       hp 0     <- both events fire on the killing blow
reset, shoot again  score 5                     hp 45    <- the plate comes back and reports again
dynamic crate       score 6                              <- not target-only; any damageable prop
payload             #x 17 and #hpf 0.40 exactly, and _lgCtx UNWOUND afterwards (no leak)
no signals          nothing fires at all
```

The unwind is tested against a THROWING signal action as well, because a leaked payload would silently
misplace every later `#here` in the level.

Two pins moved (242), both quoting the bare `fireSignals` call and the `when` dropdown; both assertions —
authoritative-side only, and the dropdown's membership — are unchanged.

## The target saved and was never read back (build 1398)

Reported from play: *"marking a prop as a target that is breakable doesn't save with the level. When I
re-open or refresh, I can't break the prop and have to go back and tick the box again."*

The flag **saved correctly**. It was never **read back**. `applyPropDynState` opened with

```js
if(!p || !p.dyn) return;
```

and build 1390 put the static-target restore INSIDE it — below a gate a static target can never pass, since
a static target has `sht:1` and no `dyn`. So `propEntry` wrote `sht`, `hp` and `bst`, the file carried them,
and the loader returned at its first line.

**The write side was already split and the read side never was.** `propEntry` has three tiers — `par` at the
top level, a `phys` block for the BODY, and a `phys || shootable` block for being DAMAGEABLE — and this had
one gate covering all three. It mirrors the serializer now, tier for tier, and the test asserts the
*symmetry* rather than the fields, because the defect was an asymmetry.

**And build 1390's own test asserted BOTH ENDS of that wire — `e.sht=1` in the serializer and `p.sht` in the
applier — and passed while nothing in between worked.** That is build 1277's defect *in the test I wrote to
prevent it*, and it is the third arrival in this stretch after 1392 and 1395. The lesson is sharper than
"pin both ends is not enough": my 1390 probe called `propEntry(o)` and read the output, which is the write
side twice. **A round trip has to go through the loader.**

### A second live bug nobody reported

`p.par` is read at that same single site, so build 1309's own stated commonest case — *"a STATIC crate on a
lift is the commonest case of all"* — has never restored its parent. That build deliberately put `e.par` at
the TOP LEVEL of the serializer so a static prop could carry it, and its only reader sat behind the dynamic
gate the whole time. Same for the 1305/1314 impact sounds on a target.

### Measured through the real save and load, then by shooting it

```
written           { sht:1, hp:40, bst:'puff', hsn:set }     (the serializer was always right)
after restore     shootable true, breakable true, maxHp 40, hp 40, puff, hitSnd restored, IN damageableProps()
shoot it          40 -> 25 -> 10 -> shattered               <- the report's own test
carried prop      parNid '770001' restored                  <- build 1309's unreported half
dynamic control   dyn / mass 7 / noGrab / maxHp 55 / puff / onFire / fireDps 9 — every field as before
plain static prop breakable undefined, maxHp undefined, NOT damageable
```

That last row is the one that makes the fix safe: moving the damage tier out of the body gate must not make
every wall in every level breakable, and it does not — the tier is gated on `dyn || sht`, the serializer's
own condition.

The function's NAME is now a lie and is deliberately left alone: renaming moves a dozen pins for no
behaviour, and the name is precisely what made 1390 drop a static field into it without noticing the gate.
The comment says to read the tiers, not the name.

**Backticks inside a template literal, for the seventh time this session** (1328, 1342, 1357 record it).
Judged not worth tooling: it is a module-parse error, so node reports it instantly and unambiguously and the
cost is one wasted probe run rather than a wrong result. Recorded so the count is honest.

## The panel that was on screen was the one that did not get built (build 1399)

Two halves of one report about the pickup authoring surface.

### 1. Build 1293's gate had a hole in it

*"There's something going on with the pickup tab in gameplay. It doesn't show correctly unless you click
another dropdown tab and then go back to it. Even then it's a little finnicky."*

Build 1293 stopped rendering the big global sections when none is on screen. **Its own comment says the block
is skipped "only when NONE of the SIX is on screen" — and the list it checks has FIVE.** The Pickups panel is
BUILT INSIDE that block and was never in the list that decides whether the block runs. So opening the
Pickups fold while those five happened to be collapsed skipped the whole thing, and the panel that was
actually on screen was the one that did not get built. Toggling any other fold made one of the five visible,
the block ran, and Pickups filled in — the reported workaround, exactly.

**Cutscenes is the same shape and had the same bug, unreported.** Both hosts are now resolved beside the
others and both are in the gate, so it tests every host it builds.

**Node counts alone could not have proven this.** With the block skipped the panel is not CLEARED either, so
it keeps stale content rather than going empty — which is what "a little finnicky" describes. The decisive
measurement is whether the panel FOLLOWS a change: with only Pickups open, adding spots and re-rendering made
it read "1 placed" then "3 placed".

### 2. A spawned pickup could not be one-shot

Build 1396 gave AUTHORED pickup spots a `once` flag. A pad spawned by the graph or by a prop signal had none
and came back forever. It rides through to the live pad now, where 1396's `_puOnce` / `_puConsume` already
know what to do with it — **the rule is still written once**, so an authored spot and a spawned pad cannot
come to different answers about the same kind. Both doors get the option: the Do node's params and the signal
editor's own row, which gained a checkbox helper beside its `lab`/`sel`/`txt` siblings.

```
once OFF vs ON   predicate false/true · after taking, gone false/true
                 20 s later, standing away: ordinary pad ready+visible (respawns 1),
                 one-shot still not ready and not visible
spawned key      one-shot by its kind, with no flag set
```

**The respawn row first read both pads as not-ready**, which looked like the flag failing on both. The probe
had spawned them at the player start and the ordinary pad was respawning under the player's feet and being
instantly re-collected. Standing 300 m away made the control produce its positive — build 1316's rule again:
before believing a null, prove the instrument can produce a positive.

Three pins moved (1293, 243, 846), all quoting the host resolution or the five-host list; every assertion
unchanged in intent, and 1293's is now stronger — *any host the block BUILDS*, rather than a list of five.

**Two test faults of my own, both about naming the wrong thing.** A sweep for stray `querySelector('#ed…')`
caught fourteen legitimate ones belonging to panels outside the block, and would have failed on every
unrelated future panel; it asks the precise question now (those two ids are each queried exactly once). And
I extracted `_applySignalAction` to find the pickup handler, which lives in `_applyWorldAction` — `pickup` is
a world verb and the signal router passes it onward. That is build 1390's mistake in miniature: naming the
wrong function and asserting confidently against it.

## Five settings that were saved and never loaded (build 1400)

Not reported — **swept for**, after build 1398 turned out to be a serializer/loader mismatch. Comparing what
`serializeLevel` writes against what the loaders read found five top-level game settings written with every
level and never read back by either runtime loader:

| | |
|---|---|
| `pvp` / `pvpTarget` | build 1265 — **mine**. The entire feature is *"a level says which mode it is for"*, so it worked until you saved |
| `fallDamage` | authored, serialized, never restored |
| `crushDamage` | likewise |
| `crosshair` | likewise |

The boot path reads all five, so a refresh looked fine — it is the two RUNTIME loaders (`restoreLevel`,
`loadLevelFromNet`) that never did. So the symptom is: open a second level, or undo, or join a co-op host,
and you keep the previous level's fall damage and crosshair. **They do not merely vanish, they LEAK** — which
is build 1325's finding for `keyNames`/`pickupModels`, arriving one tier up.

### The first measurement could not have failed

I set the values, serialized, restored **the same level**, read them back, and they were all there. That
proves nothing when the loader never clears them: I was reading state nothing had touched. The measurement
that works is to strip a field and watch it **survive** — with a field the loader demonstrably does read
(`objective`) in the same row as the positive control.

```
CARRIED    all five round-trip exactly
STRIPPED   fallOn false · fallMin 24 · crushOn false · xhStyle classic · xhSize 24 · pvp '' · target 0
           and objective (the positive control) resets too
HOSTILE    pvp 'nuke' -> ''  ·  target 1e9 -> 999  ·  style '<script>' -> classic  ·  size 1e9 -> 80
           thickness -4 -> 1  ·  gap 1e9 -> 40  ·  fallMin -50 -> 0  ·  perUnit 1e9 -> 999
```

**Always assigned, never "if present"** — that is the half that closes the leak, and it is the half a
careless fix would miss while still making a round trip pass.

### One loader instead of two

The block was **two byte-identical 2,862-character copies**. That is build 1280's defect, and precisely the
mechanism that lets a fix land on one path only. `_applyGameCfg(g)` is the one applier; the two damage rules
share `_dmgRuleFrom` because two copies of a five-field clamp is how they stop agreeing; and
`CROSSHAIR_STYLES` is now NAMED — before this it was a comment beside the boot default and nowhere else, so
nothing could validate a style arriving from a level file.

### Twenty-three harnesses moved, and every one of them was measuring the duplication

Each counted **2** over a `level.game.X` pattern — *"both loaders restore it"*. That is build 1280's lesson
verbatim: **a test that counts copies of a thing is a test of the copying.** They count 1 now, and what they
always meant is stronger, because both loaders provably route through the one function.

**Two process faults of mine, both worth the line.** A blanket regex across every test file rewrote unrelated
"both paths" assertions that legitimately count 2 (audio zones, the roster, kill-feed clips); caught by the
suite, reverted with `git checkout -- tests/`, redone scoped to the 19 files that actually reference the
block. And my replacement pin `/g\.view==='chase'/` silently matched the tail of `gameCfg.view==='chase'`
as well — six hits where one was meant. **A short variable name in a source pin is a substring of everything
that ends with it**; that one asks `extractFunction('_applyGameCfg')` instead.

## An explosion launched nothing it damaged (build 1405)

Found by sweeping the **physics booth** — the third of the three the gauntlet is scoped around ("range +
physics + AI", "movement & traversal", "logic & interaction") and the only one with no end-to-end coverage.
Thirteen of fourteen things worked: props fall and settle, crates stack, a stack topples when you shove the
top one, barrels chain-detonate, a prop can be carried and thrown, a trigger zone scores when a prop rolls
into it, and a knocked-about prop returns home on Deploy.

The fourteenth: **`explodeAt`'s dynamic-prop loop called `damageProp` and nothing else.** An explosion beside
a stack of crates knocked their health down and left every one of them standing exactly where it was —
while the ENEMY loop three lines above it has thrown actors since build 636.

### Which impulse, and why it matters

There are already two impulse writers with **deliberately different semantics**, and picking the right one
is the whole design decision:

| | |
|---|---|
| build 1258's push VERB | multiplies by mass, so an authored "20" moves a crate and a barrel the same amount |
| `pushDynamic` (a SHOT) | does not, so a heavy crate takes a hit better |

A blast is a physical event, not an authored amount, so it takes the shot's — and therefore the shot's
existing function. **No third impulse writer.** The vertical term is GEOMETRIC rather than a constant (the
full 3D direction, normalised), so a charge under a crate lifts it and one above slams it down; the strength
is the actor launch's own `(8 + R*1.2) * f * launchPower`, so the one slider a creator already tunes for
enemies moves both.

**Damage first, shove what SURVIVED** — the order every other damage site here already uses
(`if(!damageProp(...)) pushDynamic(...)`), because a shattered prop's body is gone and its debris is its own
system. And **`breakable:false` no longer skips the prop entirely**: it means "cannot be damaged", not "is
not made of matter", so an unbreakable crate beside a grenade still goes flying.

### Measured, A/B'd against the pre-1405 loop pasted back into the same tree

```
BEFORE        the crate takes 32 damage and moves 0.00 m
AFTER         2.68 m, hp 1000 -> 969
mass          a 25x heavier crate 4 m away moves 0.00 and takes 15 damage — the shot's raw-impulse
              semantics doing exactly what they should, and the reason a blast does NOT use the push verb
unbreakable   0.92 m, health untouched
```

### Four instrument faults in the new sweep, and every one read as a broken feature

| it looked like | it was |
|---|---|
| a crate that never lands, a blast that moves nothing, a goal that never scores | the booth was built at 700 to be "far from the stock level" and **fell out of the world** — the ground plane stops at ±ARENA (70). Far from the level's geometry, not out of the level |
| a crate resting *through* the floor | a box primitive is **BASE-at-origin** (build 871), so resting ON the ground is `y = 0`, and the assertion `y > 0` called a correct landing a failure |
| a goal zone that fires for anything | the trigger field is **`ptag`**; a plain `tag` sanitizes away to blank, which silently means ANY prop |
| a goal edge that would not re-arm | the check asserted an outcome without reporting whether the ball had actually LEFT the zone. It reports the position at every step now |

### And the rig had been measuring a world with no physics in it

The first run reported `physWorld: false`. `mkprobe` used to stub `__PHYSICS_READY` dead — correctly, when
Rapier came from a CDN that hangs here. **Build 1389 had already made that stub opt-in** once `rapier3d-compat.js`
was vendored and the staging started copying it; I re-derived the same finding from scratch because I did not
read that build first. Worth the line: the note in `mkprobe` is the record, and the check that matters is the
sweep's own first row — *is the physics world live?* — which is the control that makes every row under it
mean something.

**Eighteenth container rollback, mid-build.** The tree reverted to 1382 between two commands and the edit
script's `BUILD_VERSION` assert caught it before writing a byte. Recovery was the documented one — `git log`
first, then fetch + `reset --hard FETCH_HEAD`. One thing to do differently: I rescued `mkprobe.mjs` from the
working tree *after* the rollback, so the copy I saved was the STALE one, and restoring it over the recovered
file silently un-did build 1389's work. `assertFreshStaging` is what caught that, by name. **Rescue untracked
files; for tracked ones, trust the remote.**

## A trigger can change the camera, and change it back (build 1404)

Asked for from use: *"a player walks into a zone that triggers the camera to be from a single, security
camera mounted POV, or switch to a top-down angle, and then go back to normal view with a different
trigger."*

`gameCfg.view` was authored ONCE and was the only thing that decided the camera. A cinematic could move the
camera, but a cinematic **takes control** — this is a view change you keep playing through, which is the
fixed-camera idiom of every survival-horror game ever made.

### An override, never a write

`gameCfg.view` is level data, and a runtime verb must not edit the level (build 1170's rule) — a creator who
saves mid-play must not bake the security camera into their file. So `_viewOv` sits beside it and `_viewNow()`
decides, and the SERIALIZER and the editor's own view picker deliberately keep reading the authored value:
a creator choosing the level's camera must never be shown the one the graph armed.

**Four things read `gameCfg.view` to decide which camera was running**, and if the override had reached three
of them the fourth would have kept placing the old camera — this file's most-repeated defect. They all ask
`_viewNow()` now: the mode gate, the third-person gate, the chase-cursor gate and the orbit framing.

### The mounted camera

`fixed` mounts on a tagged prop. Four decisions:
- **World position**, so a camera on a lift or a parented prop (build 1309) rides it.
- **Tracking by default**, because a security camera watches you. Untracked, it takes the PROP's own
  orientation — both a prop and a camera are −Z forward, so it is build 1394's identity mapping rather than
  a conversion, and a creator aims the camera by rotating the prop.
- **The FIRST prop with the tag wins** (1394 again): a camera is one place.
- **A refusal changes nothing.** A tag nobody carries, or a view the engine does not have, is reported
  through build 1214's channel and whatever camera was running keeps running — a camera pointed nowhere is
  the worst possible failure for this verb, and snapping the player to a view they did not ask for mid-scene
  is the second worst.

### Two things that had to follow it, and one that did not

- **The cursor plane.** `_updateViewAim` branched on `vm==='top'` where the real question is *"not the
  side-scroll lane"* — a `fixed` mode would have fallen into the side branch with no lane captured and
  aimed at NaN. It asks `vm!=='side'` now, which is a generalisation: `top` and `side` were the only two
  values that reached there before this build.
- **The movement basis.** WASD under a fixed camera has to be relative to that CAMERA. The body faces the
  cursor, so a body-relative basis would steer differently every time the mouse moved. One frame stale,
  exactly like the cursor unproject above it — and a fixed camera barely moves anyway.
- **`_vcamMode()` returns `''` for `fixed`**, so the orbit framing declines it and `_viewFixedPose` is the
  only thing placing that camera. Nothing had to be added there.

`who:'actor'` (build 1232) sends it to the player who tripped the trigger and nobody else, which is what a
security camera in a co-op level means; the default reaches everyone like the other world verbs, and a
client applies the identical payload through the identical function. The camera tag interpolates (1402), so
`cam{n}` addresses a bank of them. A deploy clears the override — it is play state.

### Measured live, 16/16 (`tools/probe/camera-view.mjs`)

```

fixed        sits EXACTLY on its mount (delta 0.00 on all three axes) and looks straight at the player
             (dot 1.0000); keeps tracking as the player walks 20 m with the camera moving 0.000
untracked    looks along the prop's own facing (dot 1.0000)

deploy       clears it;  editor  sees 'fps' while the graph has 'top' armed
```

### Still open, and stated rather than implied

A fixed camera does not yet CUT between mounts on a timer, blend between them, or avoid geometry between
itself and the player — each of those is its own build. And the camera does not collide: a mount inside a
wall shows the inside of that wall, which is the creator's placement to fix.

## The gauntlet's first booth, built end to end — and the one thing it could not say (build 1403)

Build 1402 was reasoned from a gap. This one was found by **building the booth**: `tools/probe/range-booth.mjs`
authors a shooting range as a real logic graph plus real prop signals, with nothing a creator could not
author, and runs it.

```
RANGE_START -> setvar score=0 -> read time -> emit NEXT
NEXT        -> setvar n random 1..3 -> showprop plate{n}
HIT         -> addvar score+1 -> resetprop plate{n} -> hideprop plate{n} -> emit NEXT
every 1 s   -> read time -> expr left = 20 - (now - t0) -> branch left<=0 -> toast 'Time! Score {score}'
each plate   carries a `damaged` signal (1397) that emits HIT
```

**Eleven of twelve things worked.** The twelfth was that build 1402's own rule — *every field that NAMES
something* — had a hole in it: the `emit` node's event name was still a literal, so a booth with several
lanes could not say `emit lane{n}_done`. One line, and it is the line the whole loop is built on.

**The LISTENER stays literal, and that is a decision.** An `On event` name is MATCHED, not computed, so a
listener whose own name moved with a variable would answer a different question every time the graph
happened to evaluate it.

### An emit nobody hears now says so

The same defect build 1214 fixed for tags: an event no node listens for did exactly nothing, **silently** —
and a computed name makes that likelier, because `lane{n}` with `n` unset fires `lane0`. `_lgEmit` reports
through 1214's channel and **still fires**: a report is a note in the Level Check, never a refusal, because
a prop signal or a HUD button may legitimately be the only thing that hears an event this run. Only a BLANK
name fires nothing, because there is nothing to fire.

It covers the two places a creator TYPES a name to fire it — the emit node and the emit signal verb.
Everything else that fires an event (a HUD button, a trigger zone, an action bind) names a fixed event per
control and keeps calling `logicEvent` directly.

### 12/12, and four instrument faults on the way — every one read as a broken feature

| # | it looked like | it was |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | every shot missing | the booth was built at the ORIGIN, where the stock level's geometry is in the way (build 1323's rule) |
| 2 | the on-hit signal being dead | the plates carried `w:'damaged'` — the SERIALIZED key. The runtime field is `when` |
| 3 | the shots missing again | `yaw = Math.PI` aimed the firing line AWAY from the plates. Forward is `(-sin yaw, -cos yaw)` |
| 4 | the clock never firing | an `interval` node is TICKED by `updateLogic`; pulsing it by hand is not the same wire |

**And one thing NOT isolated, stated rather than papered over.** Shots in the headless renderer are
**intermittent**: identical camera, identical direction, the mag decrements every time, and roughly one in
three lands. A raycast the probe casts itself over `colliders` reports zero hits even on the shot that
connects, so the probe's comparison ray is not the same mechanism the shot uses and settles nothing. The
probe therefore **fires until it lands and reports the count**, and drives the ten-round loop through
`damageProp`, so what is measured is the BOOTH rather than the rig. Worth knowing before the next person
writes a firing probe and reads a null as a finding.

## The graph could not name a thing it computed (build 1402)

Found by asking what the gauntlet's first booth — a shooting gallery — actually needs, and checking rather
than assuming. A gallery is N plates popped one at a time in a random order, and **every piece was already
there**: `showprop`/`hideprop`/`resetprop` by tag (1170/1391), a random integer from Set variable, the
`damaged` event to score with (1397). The JOIN between them was not.

**`{score}` interpolation had existed since the toast node and reached NOTHING else.** Every field that
names a thing in the world took a LITERAL, so *"show plate&lt;n&gt;"* was unsayable — eight plates meant eight
hand-wired branches, and a ninth meant editing the graph.

Measured on build 1401, with a literal tag as the control:

```
BEFORE   literal `plate2` hid plate2  ·  `plate{n}` with n=2 hid NOTHING
         _lgPlaceAt('mark7') -> {60,60}  ·  _lgPlaceAt('mark{k}') -> null
AFTER    both hide plate2  ·  the place field resolves to the same mark
GALLERY  three nodes — event -> Set variable (random 1..3) -> `showprop plate{n}` — drew 24 times and
         popped plate3 x10, plate1 x7, plate2 x7
```

**Three nodes instead of one branch per plate**, and adding a ninth plate is now a `max` field.

### Where it lands, and why those places

- **`_lgPlaceAt`'s first line**, so the goto node's arrival tag (1394), the prop-position stats (1352) and
  every spawn/teleport verb inherit it with **no list of call sites to keep in step**. It is IDEMPOTENT — a
  resolved name has no braces left — which is what lets it sit there AND at the dispatch site above without
  either having to know about the other.
- **The `do` node's four naming fields** — the tag, the prefab, the item, and the text a player reads. The
  enums and urls beside them (`clip`, `sound`, `etype`, `pk`, `who`, `stat`, `cmd`) deliberately do not:
  interpolating an enum can only ever produce an invalid one.
- **Before the tag check**, so a computed tag that resolves to nothing is reported by the name it actually
  resolved to: *"A `hideprop` action targets the tag `plate99`, but no placed prop has that tag."* — build
  1214's channel, naming the real miss rather than the template.

**The toast's own inline copy is gone.** Two implementations of one syntax is how the two drift, and a
creator who learns `{score}` in a toast must get the same answer in a tag. Build 1231's per-player scoping
rides along for free, because it is `_lgVarKey` that does the lookup: `plate{lane@}` is THIS player's lane.

**The HUD widget's `interp` stays separate, and that is not an oversight** — build 1287 resolves through
`_hwVarKey`, which asks a different question (*"what is MY number"*, outside any event) and must not adopt
the event context's pid.

### Eight harnesses moved, and five of them were rigs rather than pins

1027, 1073, 1077, 1214, 1221 each EXECUTE engine source in a constructed scope, so a new dependency is
genuinely missing there; each is now handed `_lgName` **lifted from the source**, never restated — a rig that
restates a helper keeps passing against a stale copy. 1277 and 1073's param pins quoted the literal-only
forms; 1231's and 1287's quoted the toast's inline regex, and 1231's is now stronger, asserting the
`{coins@}` scoping **by execution** rather than by the shape of a regex literal.

### And a probe fault worth the line, because it read as the feature not working

The probe reset its plates between rounds by hand-setting `.visible`. show/hide track their own state (build
1170 also drops the collider and the body), so the next hide early-returned and the computed tag measured as
doing nothing — while the literal control, which ran first, worked. **The fix is to reset through the same
verb.** Alongside it, `tools/probe/feature-sweep.mjs` was setting `userData.phys = true` by hand for its
melee fixture; build 1392 made every damage consumer resolve through `damageableProps()`, and a prop that
merely carries the flag is in neither list. That check had been reporting a broken melee arc against a
fixture the engine could never produce — it uses `setPropDynamic` now, and the sweep reads **22/22**.

Backticks inside a template literal, for the eighth time this session (1328/1342/1357).

## A co-op joiner was playing a different level (build 1401)

Build 1400 swept the `game` block's FIELDS against its loaders. This is the same sweep one tier up: every
**top-level section** of a serialized level, checked against `restoreLevel` **and** `loadLevelFromNet`
instead of against itself. **Of the 62 sections, thirteen were wrong** — and they are not obscure. Ten of
them are one cluster, the KIT a level ships:

| | |
|---|---|
| `gun` · `aim` · `aimWep` · `invItems` · `station` · `stationEnabled` · `chest` · `coin` | restored by the editor path, read by **nothing** in the client path |
| `mountWep` · `attModels` | read at BOOT and by **neither** loader, so they leaked between levels on every path |

So a co-op joiner played the level with the engine's defaults: **the wrong gun in their hands**, the
engine's ADS pose rather than the level's, an ammo station the host did not have (or none where the host
had one), **an inventory catalog that did not contain the key the host had just given them**, and default
chest and coin meshes — both of which spawn on the client from the host's snapshot, so the two machines
were drawing different objects at the same coordinates.

`_applyLevelKit(level)` is the one applier, and both loaders call it. Build 1280's shape, third time.

### The weapons block is the other half, and it is why this is one build

Setting `gunModelUrl` on a client buys **nothing** while the client never drops its cached per-weapon
meshes. The two loaders' copies of the weapons apply had drifted **four ways, with a hole in each
direction**:

- only `restoreLevel` RESET `model`/`view`/`clips`/`noMuzzle` for a weapon the level does not mention — so
  a joiner kept the previous level's weapon models;
- only `loadLevelFromNet` applied build 1240's authored **names** — so a renamed weapon reverted to its
  factory name the moment a creator saved and reopened *their own* level;
- only `restoreLevel` dropped the cached `gunModelByWep` meshes — the one that makes the url change visible;
- only `restoreLevel` re-framed and re-showed the weapon, so a joiner never saw the swap at all.

The shipped block is the **union**, written once.

### Two things the probe found that nobody had reported

- **`if(level.station && station)` was itself a bug.** `setStationEnabled(false)` runs first and tears the
  object down, so a level that ships a custom station **disabled** found `station` null and silently kept
  the *previous* level's model url — and re-enabling it in the editor then built the previous level's
  station. The config is level DATA and lands either way now; only the LOAD waits for something to load
  into. This one was live on the editor path, which was otherwise correct.
- **`mountWep`/`attModels` had no sanitizer at all.** The boot line assigned the raw object straight
  through, which was only ever safe because no peer's level could reach them. Now that both loaders do,
  they are untrusted input like every other dictionary here (build 1325). The BOOT line is deliberately
  left raw: `SAN_KEY_MAX` is declared ~800 lines below it, `typeof` does not guard a temporal dead zone
  (build 1127), and that blob is the player's own localStorage rather than a stranger's.

### The reset IS the measurement

```
                            loadLevelFromNet        restoreLevel
BEFORE   16 of 16 values    still read the reset    (8 of them arrived)
AFTER    16 of 16 values    ARRIVED                 ARRIVED
weapons  name OLD -> Kit, an unmentioned weapon's model OLD -> '', the stale cached mesh dropped
         — identically on both paths
client   title screen OLD -> Kit, lobby backdrop OLD -> Kit, a minV+5 level REFUSED with 56 props untouched
```

Every value is RESET to a distinctive *"the joiner was in a different level"* state before the loader runs,
so a value that arrives was applied and a value that still reads the reset was not — and `keyNames`/`hudCfg`
ride along as POSITIVE controls, sections the client loader demonstrably does read. **Build 1400's first
probe restored the same level and read the values back; everything came back and it proved nothing, because
nothing had cleared them.**

### `if present`, not always-assign — and the reason is not laziness

Build 1400's rule is that a conditionally-assigned field LEAKS. All eight of the sections with a prior
reader are written **unconditionally** by `serializeLevel`, so absence means a level authored before the
field existed, and resetting those to engine defaults is a separate decision with a thousand builds of
content behind it. The two with **no** prior reader always assign, because that is what stops *their* leak.

### The sweep finishes at ZERO, and the last three are outside the kit

Three more sections were wrong and are fixed in the same pass, because they were found by it:

- **`homepage` and `lobbyBg`.** The client read `level.homepage` **only** to derive build 1215's per-game
  persist namespace and never APPLIED it, so a joiner returning to the menu got the engine's title screen
  and the engine's lobby backdrop rather than the level's.
- **`v` / `minV`.** Build 1165's format check never ran on the multiplayer path — **the one path where a
  stale cached client meets a newer level most often**, because the host picks the build. It runs before the
  teardown there, which is 1165's own rule: a refusal must cost nothing. Verified live: a level stamped
  `minV = LEVEL_FORMAT_V + 5` is refused with the prop list untouched.

All 62 sections of a serialized level are now read by both runtime loaders.

### Recorded, not fixed

`level.player` is deliberately NOT in the kit — the client keeps its own avatar and the host's character
arrives via the welcome `char` field, which is a documented decision at that line. But `pl.view` (the chase
framing) and `pl.grip` (held-gun placement) are **level-wide** and ride along with that exclusion, so a
joiner in third person uses their own framing. Splitting `applyPlayerLevel` into its per-player and
level-wide halves is its own build.

### Eight harnesses moved, and seven were counting copies

504, 530, 229, 879, 1190, 1240, 1296, 1325. Every one of the seven asserted *"restored in all three load
paths"* as a **count of 3** (or 2) over one line of source — build 1280's lesson again: **a test that counts
copies of a thing is a test of the copying**, and each would have gone green against three copies that had
quietly diverged, which is exactly what had happened to the weapons block they sat beside. They assert the
property now: boot carries it, the one applier carries it, and both loaders provably reach that applier.

The eighth is 504's, and it is the rare pin whose assertion was **inverted** rather than restated:
`if(level.station && station)` was the defect. What it always meant — the transform is only *applied* when
a station exists — is asserted directly now, beside the url landing as data either way.

**A scripted edit must CUT before it INSERTS.** The applier's body contains the very lines being removed
from `restoreLevel`, so inserting it first makes every one of those anchors ambiguous. The count assert
caught it on the first run and nothing was written, which is what they are for.

## A prop spawned during play was intangible (build 1409)

Found by the MOVEMENT booth, which is the fourth of the gauntlet's scoped sections and had never been swept:
the player walked straight through a ramp while `groundHeightAt` reported its surface climbing under them.

`finalizeProp` scheduled a physics body only `if(gltf && ...)`. Build 643 wrote that line for a late-loading
MODEL on a joiner — *"you could walk straight through them"* — and a PRIMITIVE has no gltf, so it never
qualified. Measured with a physics rebuild as the control, so the null cannot be "nothing supports the
player here":

```
                  body    stand on it    walk at it
box,   no rebuild  false  fell to 0.08   walked through
box,   rebuilt     true   3.00           blocked
wedge, no rebuild  false  fell to 0.08   walked through
wedge, rebuilt     true   1.20           climbed to 2.34
```

So **build 1216's `spawnprop` verb built scenery you fall through** — the verb whose own entry advertises "a
tycoon's buy → building appears, a wave-defense buildable turret" — and a co-op joiner's primitives arrived
intangible.

**The DEBOUNCED scheduler is the right hook, not an immediate `addStaticColliderFor`, and the reason is
ordering.** `finalizeProp` runs BEFORE the entry's dynamic state is applied, and `setPropDynamic` does not
release a static body it finds — it only splices the prop out of `colliders`. An immediate static body on a
prop about to become dynamic would strand an invisible solid box at the spawn point. The tick walks
`colliders`, which a dynamic prop has already left, so it cannot happen.

**Two things the fix had to add, and both are the same defect one layer along:**

- **The wait is now BOUNDED.** It re-armed for as long as `_glbPending` was non-zero, so a single model that
  never settles — a host that accepts the connection and then hangs, which is *not* the 404 the error path
  already counts — left every prop after it intangible for the rest of the session. Found because the probe
  sandbox is exactly that case: `_glbPending` sat at 4 and a platform the graph had just built stayed
  walk-through indefinitely. Past `PHYS_WAIT_MAX` it goes ahead; `addStaticColliderFor` is idempotent and a
  later burst schedules again, so the worst case is one extra pass over `colliders`.
- **With nothing loading the window is 60 ms rather than 350.** The long wait exists to coalesce a load
  BURST; a primitive is built synchronously and has no burst to wait for, so a platform spawned under a
  player is solid in ~4 frames instead of ~21.

### The TDZ the fix created, which is build 1331 arriving on schedule

`loadHostedProps()` is called bare at module level and builds the saved level's props at BOOT, so it reaches
`finalizeProp` — which now schedules for **every** static prop. With the declarations ~15,000 lines below,
the first saved level threw **`Cannot access '_physRebuildT' before initialization`** on its very first
prop. The `gltf` gate is what had hidden it: a boot-time primitive never called this, and a model loads
asynchronously, long after module evaluation. `test-1409` pins the whole chain — declarations before
`finalizeProp`, before `loadHostedProps`, before the module-level call.

Two pins moved in `test-495` (build 643's own harness), both correctly: "a freshly LOADED model schedules a
rebuild" became "a freshly built static prop — model OR primitive — schedules a rebuild", which is the
widening; and "it waits for the burst" gained "for a bounded time".

## The movement booth (probe, at build 1409) — 17/17, and the one bug behind both failures

`tools/probe/movement-booth.mjs` sweeps the traversal verbs from the player's own inputs in a running frame
loop: the held/tapped jump (1301), coyote time and the press buffer (1160), air control (1361), the slide
(926), the ledge grab and pull-up (1244/1289/1290), jump pads (993), ladders, water, low-gravity and haste
zones (1193), and the teleport verb. **All seventeen pass**, and the two that did not are worth recording
because they were ONE instrument bug wearing two costumes:

**`removeProp` takes an INDEX, not a prop.** Every probe in this directory had been calling it with the
object — `propModels[obj]` is `undefined` and it returns immediately — so every fixture stayed in the world
AND in the collider list. That is silent, and the next check then measures a scene it believes it cleared:

- the ramp "stalled the player at 1.44 of 2.4 m", which was the LEDGE check's 3.2 m wall still standing
  0.6 m ahead of them — the failing check now dumps `surfAhead 3.2, inSolid true` and says so itself;
- the jump pad read `kick 21.5, launched 0`, which was the coyote check's slab still under the pad.

Both looked like engine defects and neither was. **A physics rebuild mid-play was the leading hypothesis for
the second and is eliminated by measurement**: a jump apexes at 2.71 before and after `buildPhysWorld()`,
four times over. `__kill(prop)` lives in the shared rig now, and `__stand` is a full reset (jump, slide, pad
and ladder cooldowns, the coyote and buffer windows, the ledge record) rather than a teleport.

### Six instrument faults, and three of them read exactly as engine defects

- **`_jPressed` is a per-frame `const`** derived inside `loop()` from the held key's rising edge, so setting
  it from outside is overwritten before it is read. Three jump checks measured "the jump never fires".
- **A diagnostic passed SIX numbers to `spawnProp`**, so the scale became the rotation and the "slab" was a
  wildly rotated unit cube. The engine was right; the fixture was a different shape than I thought.
- **The debounce runs on the WALL clock**, which a synchronous frame drive never reaches — 180 driven frames
  looked like "the body never arrives" when no time had passed at all.
- **`gameOver` does not stop the frame loop** but it stands down the jump pads and the zone updates, so a
  sweep that cleared only the loop's own gates measured "a jump pad does nothing" with pad and player
  exactly where they should be. It is in the shared rig's gate list now.
- **A jump cooldown left by an earlier check** silently ate the next jump: the pad and the low-gravity
  checks both read "never left the ground" purely from that.
- **`__stand` settles for four frames, and standing on a pad IS the trigger** — so the pad fired during the
  settle and the measurement then started from a player already several metres up.
- **`removeProp` takes an index** (above), which is the one that cost the most: it turned every teardown in
  every probe here into a no-op, and the accumulated fixtures then read as two separate engine defects.

`tools/probe/drive.mjs` is the frame drive factored out of the AI booth so both sweeps share one
implementation, with the gate list, the pure virtual clock and the positive control in one place.

## An order reaches the enemies at ONE booth (build 1408)

The gap the AI booth surfaced while it was being written, and the first thing a multi-room level hits.
`command` resolved its audience with `s.ewho==='nearest' ? 'nearest' : 'enemies'` — all of them, or the
single nearest one to the PLAYER. So *hold position* fired at the AI booth froze every enemy in the level,
including the ones down range at the shooting gallery. **`_lgEnemyTargets` has taken a radius around a named
place since build 1288** and damage/heal/kill have used it since; the command verb could not reach it.

**The scope is its own field, not `at`.** For `alert` and `post`, `at` is the DESTINATION — *alert them to
the vault*, *move their post to the gate*. Overloading it would have read naturally in the common case and
quietly made *"post the guards near the gate at the vault"* unsayable, which is the one arrangement a
creator reaches for. `escope` + `er` sit beside it, shown only when the audience is scoped.

Measured on two booths 70 m apart, three enemies each, **with the other booth as the control** — a scoped
order that reaches nobody and one that reaches everybody are indistinguishable without it:

```
control  "all enemies patrol"          range patrol/patrol/patrol   pit patrol/patrol/patrol
scoped   "hold near range, r 12"       range hold/hold/hold         pit hunt/hunt/hunt
r 0.5    reaches neither booth         range hunt/hunt/hunt         pit hunt/hunt/hunt
bad tag  commands nobody, reported     range hunt/hunt/hunt         pit hunt/hunt/hunt
post     scope range, destination pit  all three range enemies posted at the pit
```

Both fail-closed rules come from `_lgEnemyTargets` unchanged and are what make a scoped order safe to
author: **a place that does not exist commands nobody, never everybody**, and **a radius of 0 is nowhere,
never everywhere.** A scope nothing answers to is reported through build 1214's channel rather than doing
nothing silently.

### Build 1407 is why this was four small edits

Declaring the two params in the node's table **is** wiring them — the dispatch names neither field, and
`test-1408` asserts that absence. Before 1407 this would have needed the table AND the hand-written
forwarding literal, and the second half is the one that got forgotten eight times running. Build 1406 is why
a scoped order on a prop signal survives a reload: `escope` was already in `SIG_KEYS` with room reserved,
and `er` is one entry beside it. Three builds compounding is the return on doing them in that order.

Two pins moved (1077, 1407), both re-expressed as the property rather than the count: 1077's *"this field
names ENEMIES and not the player"* is asserted directly instead of by quoting a two-option list, and 1407's
name-field count became **every member of the set interpolates**, executed — a count would only ever have
been a number to bump.

## The prefab pair is clean (verified after build 1407, not a build)

`_pfEntryOf` / `_pfSpawnEntry` were the next place to ask build 1406's question, since build 1280 keeps the
spawn side deliberately separate from `_applyPropEntry`. Measured (`tools/probe/prefab-roundtrip.mjs`): a
prop configured with every field the serializer writes — tag, name, folder, interact, NPC + dialogue, lock,
`sigNeed`, attribution, editor hide/lock, hit sound, four world-verb signals, and the whole dynamic tier
(mass, HP, break style, explosive, fire, shootable) — is copied through the real pair and its entry diffed
against the original's. **28 fields, all present, none changed**; only the identity differs, which is the
designed divergence. No build needed. Recorded so the next person does not re-derive it.

## The Do node dropped two of its own fields (build 1407)

Build 1406's shape, one layer up, found by asking the same question of the next hand-kept list. The graph's
Do node built a **hand-written literal** to forward to `_applySignalAction`, and the node's parameter table
is the list of fields a creator can fill in. Two lists, and eight builds added to one of them.

Measured (`tools/probe/do-node-forward.mjs`), against a control that fires:

```
missing: ["once", "r"]
control   "damage all enemies"        both enemies 31 -> 26
then      "damage enemies near X"     the one two metres from X: 26 -> 26
```

**So build 1288's area damage did NOTHING from the graph** — the feature whose whole point was that tower
defence, traps and mines were structurally unbuildable without it — and **build 1399's once-only pickup was
never once-only.** Both work fine from a prop SIGNAL, which is why nobody noticed: only the graph dropped
them.

The argument object is derived from the table now, and so are the defaults:
- **A select's default is its FIRST OPTION** — which is what all seven hand-written defaults already were
  (grunt, health, player, normal, speed, enemies, hunt), so nothing moved. The test asserts that against the
  real table rather than restating the seven, so reordering a dropdown fails there instead of silently
  moving a default.
- **A checkbox defaults to `def`**, which exists for exactly one field: build 1404's `vtrack`. That default
  lived only inside the forwarding literal, so **the editor rendered the box UNCHECKED while the runtime
  treated it as on.** The table is the one place that says so now, and the node renderer reads it too.
- A text/number field arrives BLANK rather than absent, which every handler already reads as its own default
  (`+s.amt||25`, `+s.r||0` — and 0 is the fail-closed direction for a radius).
- `_LG_NAME_FIELDS` states build 1402's four (now six) interpolating fields once, instead of one `_lgName`
  call per site.

### Two instrument faults, both of which read exactly like the defect

`_lgPulse` takes a node **ID** and looks it up, so passing it a node OBJECT returns at `_lgNode(id)` and
does nothing. And the switch is on **`n.type`**, not `n.t`, so a node keyed the other way is found and then
falls through every case. Neither throws. **The positive control — the same verb with an audience that has
always worked — is the only reason those were not published as "the feature is dead".** Build 1316 recorded
the general form and it earned its keep again: *before believing a null, prove the instrument can produce a
positive.*

The probe's first check also SCANNED THE SOURCE for the forwarding literal. After the fix there is no
literal, so it reported every field missing — a probe that reads the code rather than the behaviour calls
the fix a regression. It fires a node and reports what the handler received.

Eight harnesses moved (1027, 1073, 1074, 1077, 1214, 1277, 1402, 1404), each keeping its intent. Two of them
EXECUTE the do branch and needed the derivation supplied, lifted from source rather than restated; without
it the branch threw, its own catch reported "a do action failed", and test-1214's failure counts read one
too high — which is the same class of silent miscount this build removes.

## A prop signal lost everything but its verb (build 1406)

Found while scoping the AI booth's next gap, and it had been true for a long time. `serializeLevel` wrote a
prop's signals through a HAND-WRITTEN short-key list — `w, d, t, c, n, f, ci, tx, ni, nc, cn, so` — and the
signal editor writes `etype, n, at, pk, item, once, who, amt, r, stat, mul, ewho, cmd, vmode, vtag, vtrack`
on top of that. Nothing carried the second list.

Measured with the real serializer across all seventeen verbs a signal can carry
(`tools/probe/signal-roundtrip.mjs`):

```
before   3/17 survive        after   17/17
"command nearest -> hold @post1"   {"w":"used","d":"command"}
                               ->  {"w":"used","d":"command","a":"post1","ew":"nearest","cm":"hold"}
"view fixed on cam1, tracking"     {"w":"used","d":"view"}
                               ->  {"w":"used","d":"view","vm":"fixed","vt":"cam1","vk":1}
```

**Fourteen of seventeen lost every parameter.** `music` and `objective` survived only because `sound` and
`text` happened to be on the list; `anim` survived because it is a tag verb. So a creator authors "the
pressure plate spawns 3 brutes at the gate", tests it — it works, because the in-memory object is right —
saves, reloads, and gets one grunt at the player. **Silently, and only after a save**, which is the worst
shape a data-loss bug can have.

**The cause is not a missing field; it is that the mapping was kept by hand in three places.** The list was
written when signals were tag verbs only, and builds 1073, 1074, 1077, 1170, 1216, 1258, 1399 and 1404 each
added a world verb to the signal dropdown without touching it. That is build 1280's finding one layer down —
*a test that counts copies of a thing is a test of the copying* — so `SIG_KEYS` names the mapping once and
`_sigPack` / `_sigUnpack` derive from it, used by the serializer and by BOTH loaders.

Three constraints on the table, each of which is a defect the other way:
- **The twelve original short keys are FROZEN.** Every level ever saved uses them, so `cs` must stay `n` —
  which is why the count field `n` takes `q` rather than the obvious letter. A short key is a wire format.
- **Falsy is absent**, exactly as the hand-written emitter had it (`if(s.clip) x.c=s.clip`). Nothing in the
  engine can tell an amount of 0 from an unset one (`+s.amt||25`), so emitting it would grow every saved
  level for a value that means nothing — and would break `pack(unpack(x)) === x` for a pre-1406 signal,
  which is the property that makes this safe to ship over existing content.
- **Booleans emit 1**, matching the old wire form, and come back as 1 rather than `true`. Every consumer
  tests truthiness; test-1280's `eq(sg.contain, true)` became `assert(sg.contain)` for that reason.

**And build 1404's own gap, one build later.** That build put `view` in the signal verb dropdown and never
gave it a parameter row, so a signal could select *Camera view* and had no way to say WHICH view. It is
build 1277's defect — a verb offered and not reachable — committed by the build that recorded it. The row is
here, gated on `fixed` exactly as the graph node gates its tag field.

### The test asserts the property, not the fields

Pinning the field list is what failed for eight builds. `test-1406` instead extracts the signal editor's own
`s.X =` writes and asserts **every one is a key `SIG_KEYS` carries** — so the next verb that adds a field
fails here rather than shipping. It asks the same question of the verb dropdown: every configurable verb it
offers must have a row that configures it. That second check is what caught `view`.

**A slice scoped by a character count broke it first**, for the umpteenth time: the dropdown scan used a
fixed window that reached back into the WHEN select and reported `destroyed` and `contact` as verbs with no
row. It walks back from the select's own callback to its option list now.

**And the probe was wrong before the engine was right.** Its first draft PASTED the loader's body inline, so
after the fix the serializer carried every field and the probe still reported them lost — it was measuring
its own stale copy of the thing under test. It calls the engine's `_sigUnpack` now. *A probe that reimplements
the code under test is a probe of the reimplementation.*

Seven harnesses moved (242, 291, 528, 538, 549, 1280, 1397), every one keeping its intent: "this field
serializes and is restored at every load site" is now asserted against the one table and the two shared
functions rather than against a quotation of the code that had drifted.

## The AI booth (probe, after build 1405)

The last of the three the gauntlet is scoped around. `tools/probe/ai-booth.mjs` reads **16/16** and found no
engine defect — every one of its seven failures was an instrument fault, and four are worth carrying:

- **`loop()` early-returns past the ENTIRE simulation** when any UI gate is up (the level loader, a cutscene,
  an interstitial, the shop, the upgrade picker, the map, the inventory, `paused`) — and `_frameNo` is
  incremented BEFORE all of them, so a drive that simulated nothing still reported its full frame count.
  That is why two runs of the same sweep disagreed 8/15 against 11/15 on the same tree: clearing the field
  reaches `beginUpgradeChoice`. The gates are cleared at the head of every drive and `__gate()` names the
  one that was closed.
- **Half the AI's timers are wall-clock TIMESTAMPS, not countdowns** (`_windupT = performance.now() + 320`),
  so a drive that advances only the simulated clock never completes a wind-up. The telegraph fired, the
  squash played, and the swing never landed — which reads exactly like broken melee.
- **Clamping that virtual clock forward to the real one advanced it at the REAL rate** (2 ms a call instead
  of 16.67), so an enemy twenty simulated seconds into a chase had not moved. It is a pure counter now, and
  `_tabHidden` holds the page's own rAF frames off so the virtual clock is the only clock.
- The spawn descriptor key is `fac`; what lands on the enemy is **`faction`**.

**There is no `updateEnemyAI`** — the enemy tick is inline in `loop()`, and real frames are unusable here
(measured: `_frameNo` advances 3 times in 3 seconds, so 3 simulated seconds would take 3 real minutes).
`__drive(n)` calls the real `loop()` with `renderer.render` a no-op and the rAF re-arm neutralised: **300
frames in 469 ms.**

`tools/probe/lint.mjs` closes the backtick trap that has cost eleven cycles — a backtick inside a probe's
page-code template literal closes it, and Node reports "missing ) after argument list" at an innocent line.
It skips escaped backticks and nested `${...}` interpolation, and is controlled both ways: 123 probes clean,
one injected backtick caught at the right line. **Run it before running a probe.**

## The chase camera frames the player, not the costume (build 1413)

Recorded with numbers at build 1290 and deferred there: `centerLocal.y` is **half the drawn model's
height** (a hardcoded 1.0 for the stock capsule), and it is the third-person pivot — so the camera's
height, and everything the player can see over, was a property of whichever character was equipped. A
0.5 m creature gives 0.25 and a 4 m mech gives 2.0, against an `EYE` that is 1.7 whatever the model.

This is **build 1289's rule one function along**: *a gameplay quantity must never be derived from
something only the renderer knows.* That build fixed the ledge hang, which read the drawn body's bounding
box for the COLLIDER's reach. And this function already knew better in its other half — the no-model
fallback has always been `EYE - 0.3`, player-derived. The two halves disagreed about what the pivot is for.

`TP_PIVOT_MIN = EYE * 0.5` and `TP_PIVOT_MAX = EYE + 0.15` — the player's own hip and the top of their
own head. **Every model between 1.7 m and 3.7 m tall is byte-identical**, which is every humanoid and the
stock capsule; outside it the camera was looking along the floor, or down at a character it was supposed
to be behind.

### Why clamping Y is safe and clamping X/Z would not be

`_tpPivot`'s own comment says pivoting on the model's real centre *"keeps ANY model on the crosshair while
it rotates in place instead of swinging around the reticle"* — and that is what stopped this being
clamped for 120 builds. It is **true of x and z, which are ROTATED by yaw**, and **false of y, which is a
plain add**: a vertical difference between the pivot and the model's centre is a constant screen offset
and can never become a swing. `test-1413` measures it over 720 headings rather than restating it — x and
z sweep the full diameter of the model's own horizontal offset, y is identical at every one.

### Measured through the whole boom (`tools/probe/chase-pivot.mjs`, 12/12)

`test-1413` drives `_tpPivot` in isolation; the probe drives `tpCameraPushback` — damping, tilt, collide —
and reads `camera.position.y` off the real camera, which is the number a player experiences. The stock
capsule is the control.

```
pivot above the avatar's own feet    humanoid 0.90 (untouched) · creature 0.25 -> 0.85 · mech 2.00 -> 1.85
camera height, full boom             humanoid 0.98 vs stock 1.08 (within 15 cm)
                                     creature 0.93 — no longer at ankle height
                                     mech 1.93 vs a tall humanoid's 1.18 — bounded, not a stop above
ordering                             0.93 < 0.98 < 1.93 — a bigger character still frames higher
in frame                             the character's own centre projects inside the frame at all three
```

**The first probe run read every pivot 0.0801 too high, and the engine was right.** The pivot is
`footY + clamped(cl.y)`, and `footY` is the avatar's own foot height — not zero, and not
`player.pos.y - EYE`. Comparing a pivot to a bare bound compares two different origins. The tell was that
all three readings were out by *exactly* the same amount.

### What this does NOT close, stated rather than implied

Build 1290 recorded two things: the pivot is derived from the art, and *"there is no authored control over
it"*. This closes the first. The second is now much smaller and deliberately left: with the pivot bounded
to the player's own body the spread across every humanoid a creator would equip is ~0.25 m, and `tpHeight`
is a **parallel** camera offset (`tpCameraPushback` looks along the frame's own forward, not back at the
pivot — asserted), so it absorbs that. A fifth framing slider would be a fifth value in `_sanitizeView` /
`_snapshotView` / `_applyView` / `_loadPersonalView`, which is the hand-kept-list defect this file records
more than any other, for a quarter of a metre a creator can already dial out.

**Three pins moved, and one of them CRASHED rather than failing** — `test-1086` evaluates `_tpPivot` in an
isolated scope, so a new module-level constant is genuinely missing there. It printed no PASS/FAIL line at
all, so the summary said `1149/1151, 2 FAILED` with only ONE `FAIL` visible; `run-all` reports a crashed
harness on a `stderr:` line, which is the thing to grep for when those two numbers disagree. Its rig lifts
the bounds from source rather than restating them — and `extractConst` cannot read them, because both live
on one `const` statement, so the whole declaration comes out by regex.

**And half of another pin had been asserting the defect.** `test-214`'s quoted
`_TPP.x = … && _TPP.z = … && _TPP.y = fY + cl.y` in one assertion called *"pivot rotates the local centre
by yaw + sits at model-centre height"*. The first clause is byte-identical and still the thing that stops
the model swinging around the reticle; the second was a pin ON the bug. They are two assertions now.

## The probe lint had been passing vacuously (build 1413)

`tools/probe/lint.mjs` exists because a backtick inside a probe's page-code template closes the literal and
Node reports it at an innocent line — a trap recorded against builds 1328, 1342 and 1357. It has been run
before every probe this session and **it was checking nothing.**

Its opener required the page code's `(` to follow the backtick IMMEDIATELY. Every probe written against
`DRIVE_RIG` opens `probe(DRIVE_RIG + \`` and puts `(function(){` on the **next line**, so the opener matched
nothing, the walk never ran, and those files were reported CLEAN without being looked inside. It was found
the only way it could be: by writing a probe with the fault in it, watching Node's parse error, and running
the lint that had just called that file clean.

**A checker that cannot find the thing it checks reports success, which is worse than not running it at
all — because it is believed.** So the fix is two parts: the opener tolerates whitespace, and a file that
hands a template literal to `probe()` whose page code the lint *cannot* find is now reported as
**NOT CHECKED** rather than counted clean. Silence about a file it did not examine was the defect.

Widening the opener then produced **four false positives** — probes that store their page code in a const
and put the closing backtick on its own line, where `indexOf('})()\`')` misses and the walk runs past the
real end and flags the CLOSING backtick. That is the other way for a checker to be useless, so the close is
a regex over `})()` plus whitespace plus the backtick. Controlled both directions: a deliberately broken
file still fires, and 136 real probes are clean.

## The level can point at where to go (build 1412)

A level made of separate places — a fair with five booths, a hub with four doors, an objective across the
map — could TELL the player where to go (objective text, a toast, and since 1411 a sign at the door) and
could not **point**. The only marker in the engine was `mapWaypoint`, which a PLAYER drops on their own
map. A creator had nothing.

`marker` is a world verb, so it inherits `who` from build 1232 unchanged: the default reaches everyone,
and `actor` marks the objective for the one player who tripped the trigger — which is what a co-op level
with a split objective means. `_applyMarker` is the ONE applier and a client runs it on the identical
payload, so the two cannot come to different answers.

Four decisions:

- **A SET, not one marker, capped at 8.** "The objective" and "here are the five booths" are both real,
  and a creator switching between them should not need a different verb. **The same tag twice is the same
  marker**, updated in place — otherwise an interval that re-marks fills the cap in four seconds.
- **One place, never a random one.** `_lgPlaceAt` picks at RANDOM among props sharing a tag so a spawned
  squad scatters (1394 recorded that distinction), and an arrow that points at a different crate every
  frame is not a marker. A tag resolves the FIRST live prop — which is also what makes it **track**: a
  marker on a lift rides it, and one on a prop the graph moves follows. Anything else (`me`, `start`,
  `#here`, a trigger name) resolves to a static point through the same shared vocabulary.
- **DOM in the HUD, not a world sprite.** An objective marker has to read THROUGH geometry (that is what
  it is for), stay crisp at any distance, and clamp to the screen edge when the target is behind you. A
  world-space sprite fights all three.
- **A place nothing answers to is REFUSED and reported** (1214's channel). An arrow pointing nowhere is
  worse than no arrow.

The label interpolates through `_hwInterp` — the same function a HUD widget and a build-1411 sign use — so
all three agree about what `{coins@}` means, and `Hits {hits}` on a marker is a scoreboard you can see
from across the map.

### The one thing the maths will not do for you

**Behind the camera, `project()` mirrors BOTH axes.** A target at your back therefore lands on the wrong
side of the screen, and the arrow points the player exactly the wrong way — the single worst failure this
feature has, and it looks entirely plausible in code. `const behind = _mkV.z > 1` flips it back before the
edge clamp. The probe measures it directly: with the player facing −Z and the target at +Z, the arrow must
sit at the BOTTOM of the screen (**y 326 of 360**); unflipped it sits at the top.

### Two defects the live probe found and no Node test could have

- **The signal router's verb list — build 1277's defect, committed again, by me.** `marker` was in the Do
  node's dropdown, in the signal editor, in `SIG_KEYS` and in `_applyWorldAction`, and the router's
  hand-kept `s.do==='…'||…` chain did not name it, so **the verb was completely inert**. Every end was
  pinned and the wire was not. `test-1412` opens by asserting the router line, because that is the link
  that keeps going missing.
- **A null read that took the frame loop down.** The guard for "the marked prop was destroyed" was written
  INSIDE the re-resolve — so it covered the frame the prop died on and **not the next one**, when
  `m.prop` is already null, the re-resolve is skipped, and the static-point branch reads `m.pt.x` off
  null. The probe hit it on its second drive. It is a bare statement followed by the guard now, and the
  test asserts that SHAPE rather than the behaviour, because the behaviour needs a frame to show.

```

### Eight pins moved, and seven were the same trap

Six quoted a WHOLE VERB LIST (1073 x2, 1077, 1232, 1404 x3) and one a whole verb COUNT (1277) — so every
verb that legitimately joined broke them **with every part of what they meant still true**. That is builds
519 and 928's trap from build 1411, one day later and in a different table, and the fix is the same:
assert MEMBERSHIP of the real field, extracted, rather than quoting the literal. 1073's now also asserts
what must NOT be in the list, which is the half a quoted literal was silently providing.

The eighth is 1074's, and it is the character-budget trap: `src.slice(i, i + 1200)` over the client's
`wact` block, which this build's own line pushed two still-true assertions past the end of. `wact` is the
LAST case in its handler, so there is no next case to end on — `extractFunction('handleHostMsg')`
brace-matches and cannot drift at all, which is build 1149's preferred answer rather than its fallback.

**The general form, now stated once for both:** *a pin that quotes a neighbourhood — a whole list, a whole
count, a fixed number of characters — is a pin against the neighbourhood, not against what it says.*

### And prose defeated a pin for the third time in two builds

`!/innerHTML/` failed against correct code — it matched this build's own comment saying it never uses
`innerHTML`. Build 1411's `!/raycast/` was the same, and 164/1393/1395 record it from the other direction
(a pin SATISFIED by prose). The rule is now unconditional: **pin the syntax, never the bare word** —
`/\.textContent = /` and `/\.innerHTML\s*=/`, not the identifier.

## A sign in the world, and a scoreboard on it (build 1411)

The engine could draw text in the world for **damage numbers** and **player name tags**, and nowhere else.
A creator labelling a room, a booth or a door had to leave the engine, make an image, host it and import it
as a textured plane — and could never show a NUMBER that changes. Every other authoring tool ships a text
object; this one had two hardcoded ones and no way to author either.

**It is a PRIMITIVE, which is the whole reason it is small.** The gizmo, snapping, duplication, the
clipboard, prefabs, tags, serialization, undo, multiplayer prop sync, the outliner and the LOD all arrive
for free — build 1250 made exactly this argument for the ambient emitters, and build 1320 made the shape
tables one table, so the + menu, the palette, the radial and the Object panel all serve it with no wiring.

**And the two tables it is deliberately NOT in are behaviour, bought for nothing.** `SHAPE_PRIMS` gates
instancing: a sign carries its own canvas texture and could never share a batch material (1139's `_instKey`
lesson), so excluding it is correct AND free. `MAT_PRIMS` gates the colour/texture panel, which would
otherwise fight the sign panel for the same material.

### It interpolates, which is the half no imported image can do

`Hits {score}` is a live scoreboard on a wall. Three decisions:

- **It shares `_hwInterp` with the HUD.** Build 1287 established that a HUD widget resolves `name@` through
  `_hwVarKey` (`NET.myId`) and NOT through `_lgVarKey` (the event's pid), because it draws **every frame,
  outside any event**. A world sign is the identical case. So the function was lifted out of `_hwText`
  rather than the regex copied — two implementations of one syntax is how the two drift (1402's rule, and
  1287 was the bug).
- **A sign with no brace is rendered once and never touched again.** `_signTick` runs at 4 Hz, skips every
  sign whose text carries no `{`, and `_signRender` returns immediately when the resolved text and the
  geometry are unchanged. A level with a hundred labels pays for one boolean each.
- **The canvas follows the prop's SCALE**, quantised to 64 px, so a 4×1 banner is not the same text
  stretched and a gizmo nudge does not reallocate a canvas every frame.

### Four decisions that are each a defect the other way

- **Unlit (`MeshBasicMaterial`).** A label has to be readable in an unlit corner — and an unlit material
  also keeps the sign out of every shader patch (1139/1384/1388) that assumes a Standard material.
- **Double-sided.** A sign that is invisible from one side is the "nothing happened" failure. The honest
  cost is that the back reads mirrored; the panel says so, and two signs back to back fix it.
- **`noCol` ON by default** (build 1324's flag). A label is not a pane of glass: defaulting it solid would
  put an invisible wall in front of a booth that stops bullets and makes enemies path around it. A creator
  who wants a solid board unticks it — and the builder deliberately does **not** stamp the raycast itself,
  so `refreshPropCollider` stays the one writer and unticking gives the board its hits back cleanly.
- **The colours are VALIDATED, not escaped.** They go into a canvas `fillStyle`, and a bad value there does
  not throw — it silently keeps the PREVIOUS `fillStyle`. So one hostile string would paint the text in the
  board colour and the sign would read **blank with nothing failing**. `_signColor` accepts a hex or hands
  back the default.

`_pfSpawnEntry` needed the apply too, not just `_applyPropEntry` — build 1280 keeps that near-copy separate
on purpose, and without the line a duplicated sign comes back blank, which is build 1162's defect exactly.
`test-1411` counts the apply sites at exactly two.

### Measured live (`tools/probe/sign-prop.mjs`, 21/21)

A canvas is the one thing a Node harness structurally cannot check — it can prove the maths and the wiring,
and only a real 2D context can say whether anything was DRAWN. So the probe reads the canvas back and counts
text pixels, **with an empty sign as the control** so the count is provably measuring text:

```
'SHOOTING RANGE'   14,386 ink pixels        ''   0
4x2 prop           canvas 2.00:1            1x4 prop   0.50:1
'Hits {hits}' at hits=0   byte-identical ink to the literal 'Hits 0'
hits 0 -> 7        the live board repaints within the tick
                   the STATIC sign beside it does not move a pixel
                   and 40 more frames change nothing — it stops working when the variable does
{coins@}           resolves through the HUD's per-player key, not the graph event's
noCol on           0 collider boxes, raycast neutralised
noCol off          1 box, raycast back — both from the one writer
round trip         {text, size:90, align:'left'} out and back, already drawn on arrival
```

**The static sign beside the live one is what makes the repaint mean anything.** Without it, "the ink
changed" is equally consistent with the tick repainting everything every frame, which is the thing this
design exists not to do.

### Two pin-writing notes, both mine, both the same trap from opposite ends

`!/raycast/.test(buildSignProp)` failed against correct code — it matched the builder's own COMMENT
explaining that it leaves the raycast alone. Builds 164, 1393 and 1395 record a pin being **satisfied** by
prose; this is a pin being **defeated** by it, and the fix is the same: assert the ASSIGNMENT
(`/\braycast\s*=/`), never the bare name.

And `bga: 0` must survive the sanitizer — "floating text with no board behind it" is a real thing to author,
and the `+c.bga || 0` shape that would silently swallow it is build 1329's recorded trap.

`docs/REFERENCE.md` gained the sign in the same pass, and **`+ Pillar`** with it — the docs' shape list was
still the pre-1320 nine, which is that build's own finding surviving in the one place it did not look.

### And it did not boot — the TDZ, for the fifth time

A saved level containing ONE live sign stopped the game starting: **`Cannot access 'NET' before
initialization`**. `loadHostedProps()` is called bare at module level and builds the saved level's props
during boot (1331's whole subject), so a saved sign is applied there, rendered there, and therefore
resolves its variables there — through `_hwVarKey`, which reads `NET`. **`const NET` is declared ~5,700
lines below that call.**

`_hwVarKey` had guarded with `typeof NET!=='undefined'` since build 1287, and that guard was correct for
124 builds because its only caller was the HUD, which draws long after boot. **`typeof` does not guard a
temporal dead zone — it THROWS for an uninitialised `const`** (1127, 1331, 1350, 1383, and now this). A
`try/catch` is what actually guards one.

**The whole Node suite passed at 1149/1149 while the game did not boot**, because nothing in it evaluates
a saved level with a sign in it. What found it was reading the declaration order and then *reproducing it*:
`tools/probe/sign-boot-tdz.mjs` seeds a saved level into localStorage through an init script — a driver
capability this build added, and the only way to probe what a saved level does to the boot path — with a
STATIC sign beside the live one as the control, since a static sign never reaches the interpolator.

```
before   [ERR] Cannot access 'NET' before initialization   ...then a 90 s boot timeout
after    2 signs in the scene, both DRAWN during the load, the live one resolved to "Score 0"
```

`test-1411` turns it into a standing guard three ways: the `try/catch` is pinned, the ORDERING that makes
it necessary is asserted (so moving either end is visible), and `_hwVarKey` is **executed inside a real
dead zone** — the pre-fix form throws there.

### Six pins moved, and one of them was testing nothing

1058 and 1287 EXECUTE `_hwText`, so a lifted-out dependency is genuinely missing in those rigs; both are
handed `_hwInterp` **from source**, never restated, and 1287's two regex pins moved to its new address with
their intent untouched. 1250's anchored on `buildFxEmitter('fx_fountain') };` being the END of the builder
table; it asserts the six entries as a property instead.

**1320's was the interesting one.** It sliced the builder table from its declaration to that same
`fx_fountain` literal — and when the sign landed after it, `indexOf` returned **−1**, the slice ran to the
wrong place, and **every key check failed against correct code**. That is build 1392's recorded hazard (an
`indexOf` that misses is not an error, it is a wrong answer) and the same class as a character-budget
window. It ends on the named declaration that follows the table now, and **asserts both anchors were
found**, so the next move fails loudly instead of quietly testing an empty string.

519 and 928 are the other kind: both asserted the shape set as a **quoted join** of all ten keys, so they
broke the day the list grew with every part of what they meant still true. Both assert MEMBERSHIP now (928
keeps `box` first, which is its slot picker's actual default). *A pin that quotes a whole list is a pin
against the list, not against what it says* — the character-budget trap in its other costume.

## Several props under one tag are a camera BANK (build 1410)

Build 1404 resolved the camera tag to the **first** prop carrying it and wrote *"a camera is ONE place"*.
That is the one place in the engine where a tag means one thing: a tag has named a **set** since build 1299
— a level has thirty crates and one tag — and every other tag-taking verb acts on all of them. So the
second, third and fourth props a creator tagged `seccam` were placed, serialized, tagged and **unreachable**,
and the security-desk idiom the verb was asked for needed a graph counter plus one `view` node per angle.

`_viewMountsFor(tag)` returns them all in `propModels` order — the level's own order, which is what the
outliner shows — and `vdwell` cuts between them. **The singular `_viewMountFor` is GONE**, not rewritten in
terms of the list: after this build nothing called it, and a second resolver with no callers is a trap —
the next build that wants "the camera" reaches for it and gets camera 1 rather than the one the bank is
currently showing. `test-1410` pins its absence.

Four decisions:

- **0 is OFF and byte-identical to 1404.** No clock is read at all (`if(ov.dwell > 0)` guards the whole
  block), so every level authored before this build pays nothing and behaves exactly as it did. That is
  also what a pre-1410 host sends: the `vw` payload gained a fourth element, and a missing one reads 0.
- **A positive dwell is FLOORED, not honoured.** A level file is untrusted input (1325) and an authored
  0.001 would strobe the screen. `VIEW_DWELL_MIN` is 0.25 — a fast cut, which is a legitimate thing to
  author — rather than a refusal.
- **A gap over a second RE-BASES the clock instead of cutting.** It is a pause, a tab-back or a level
  load, not elapsed dwell; without it, unpausing after thirty seconds flicks through ten cuts in the frame
  the player comes back on. Same rule, same reason, as the chase camera's `_tpPrevT` (build 894).
- **Membership is re-resolved ON THE CUT**, never per frame — `_viewMountsFor` is an O(propModels) walk,
  and a cut is exactly the moment a camera spawned or destroyed since the last one should join or leave.
  A mount destroyed mid-*dwell* still re-resolves on the spot, because the alternative is a player staring
  at a corpse for a whole dwell.

**`_viewMountsFor` skips a prop with no `parent`, and that is not tidiness.** Build 1404's re-resolve —
*"the mount can be destroyed mid-round, re-resolve by tag rather than holding a dead object"* — only works
if the resolver refuses the dead one; otherwise it hands back the very object it was called to replace.
The probe found this by killing a camera mid-cycle and watching the bank sit on it.

**And the row says so.** Nothing else in the product tells a creator that tagging a SECOND prop makes a
bank — the field reads *"cut every [ ] s — tag several props to cut between them"*, because a capability
nobody can find is one that does not exist (build 1348).

**Each peer runs its own dwell clock from the moment it armed the bank.** The camera is a local view
(`who:'actor'` sends it to one player), so there is nothing to keep in step and a synchronised bank would
need a clock in the message for no gain.

### Two kills, recorded so they are not rediscovered as gaps

- **BLEND between mounts.** A security camera cuts; a survival-horror fixed camera cuts at the doorway.
  Sliding the viewpoint from one mount to another is a CINEMATIC move and this engine already has
  cinematics for it (`cineCfg`, shots carrying `path` / `lensFrom-To` / `focusOn` / `ease`). A second,
  weaker path to the same thing inside a gameplay camera would duplicate that system and would read as a
  drifting camera rather than as a camera bank.
- **GEOMETRY AVOIDANCE.** `tpCameraPushback` collides for a reason that does not apply here: the player
  DRAGS that camera through the level and it legitimately ends up inside a wall. A mount is **authored** —
  the creator chose where it goes, and pulling it toward the player would move it off the spot they picked.
  The case that looks like a defect (the player walks behind a pillar and the camera shows a pillar) is
  the fixed-camera idiom working, not failing. `test-1410` pins the absence of `_cameraCollide`.

### Three instrument failures, and the last one is a standing trap

Measured live (`tools/probe/camera-bank.mjs`, 16/16): three real props, armed through the real
`_applySignalAction`, sampled off the real frame loop — every sample lands EXACTLY on a mount, all three
are visited and the cycle wraps, a destroyed camera is never shown again while the surviving two keep
cutting. Getting there cost three wrong readings:

| # | it reported | why |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 2 of 3 cameras | the sample stride (500 ms) DIVIDED the dwell (2 s), so every cut landed on the exact boundary frame and float drift in `__vnow += (1/60)*1000` decided whether the last one fired |
| 2 | 1 of 3 — "the bank never cuts" | rewritten to sleep in Node. **`__drive` VIRTUALISES `performance.now()`** (drive.mjs installs a counter and restores the real clock on the way out), so sleeping advances a clock the engine is not reading |
| 3 | — | and the drives must be ONE eval: between `probe()` calls the real clock is back, ~1e5 ms behind the virtual one, so the next drive's first frame looks like a 100-second gap and trips the pause re-base, throwing the cycle's progress away every sample |

**#1 is the general one: a sampling stride that divides the period under test measures the boundary, not
the behaviour.** Both #2 and #3 are the same root — a probe rig that virtualises a clock has to be the
only thing driving anything that reads it.

Three pins moved (1404 ×3), each keeping its intent: the override holds a LIST whose head is what a
bank with no dwell shows, the re-resolve covers the whole bank, and the `vw` payload carries the dwell.
1404's own stubs gained a `parent`, which is what the engine reads to mean live.

## The post-1381 critic pass is CLOSED (recorded build 1414)

This section used to be titled *"The next build, specified"* and it sat near the top of the file reading
as the standing next task **after all three of its items had shipped**. A session picked it up, started
re-implementing the macro layer, and found `applyMacroDetail` already in the tree. A stale "build this
next" note is worse than no note: it is followed.

The blind verdict named ONE tell — *"regular, unbroken texture tiling on the two largest surfaces in
frame"* — and two supporting findings. Where each of them went:

| finding | closed by |
|---|---|
| `floorMat`/`wallMat` get neither a break-up layer (1379 refuses a material with a map) nor macro variation | **build 1382.** `applyMacroDetail(floorMat, MACRO_PERIOD_M)` and the same for `wallMat`, at `MACRO_TILE_MUL = 2.75` — deliberately not an integer multiple of `SURF_TILE_M`, or the layer lands on the repeat it exists to hide. The frequency is `1 / periodMetres`, because these two geometries are real metres and unscaled; the primitive path's `_albDetailFreq` would have been three orders of magnitude off and would have looked like nothing happening |
| the 1145/1379 procedural normal noise aliases with no AA to suppress it once MSAA sheds | **build 1383.** `_syncOdBump` indexes `_OD_BUMP_STEP` by `_prStepI`, so the relief fades down the adaptive ladder exactly as the critic suggested — by reference through one shared uniform (1181), so a rung change is one CPU write and recompiles nothing |
| point lights still cannot cast shadows (29 of them around the stock spawn) | **build 1414**, after 1348 parked it on a broken instrument. See below |

## The carried set belongs to the campaign, not to the file you ticked (build 1416)

Build 1415's own probe hit this on its first run and reported a defect that did not exist, which is the
strongest possible evidence a creator will hit it too.

`persistVars` — the list of what carries between levels — is level DATA: ticked in the Rules tab, saved
into that one file. A gauntlet is one file per booth, so the same names had to be ticked in **every room**,
and a room that forgot ended the run at its own door with nothing said anywhere. Measured on three rooms
where only the first ticks `score`, against a control where every room does
(`tools/probe/campaign-carry.mjs`):

```
only room 1 ticks it     12  ->  null  ->  null
every room ticks it      12  ->   12   ->   12      <- the control, i.e. build 1415 working
```

So the TICK now means *"this room passes its value on"* and the seed takes whatever the campaign is
carrying. **`_persistCommit` already had the matching half** — it writes only the ticked names and never
deletes the rest — which is why this is one line in `_persistSeed` rather than a redesign, and why the
accumulate-across-rooms property is asserted by executing the commit rather than by reading it.

Three things it is deliberately not:
- **Not "carry everything".** `campaignVars` only ever contains names some room COMMITTED, so a scratch
  variable stays scratch — checked both in the probe and by ticking a name that was never committed.
- **Not a format change.** A single-level game, and a campaign whose rooms all tick the same names, are
  byte-identical: the two sets are the same set there.
- **Not silent.** The panel now LISTS a name another room ticked, unticked, beside the "carrying now:"
  line that says what it holds — the honest state, since it arrives either way.

**And build 1415 had left the panel's own text stale**, which is worth catching in the build that notices
rather than the audit that eventually would: it still said the value *"is saved when a level is cleared"*,
a sentence that stopped being the whole truth the moment a doorway started committing.

### An instrument fault worth the line

The probe's first run reported all three rooms declaring the carry in BOTH conditions — no trap, nothing
measured. `serializeLevel()` reads the LIVE persist list, so a base captured after a previous run carries
it into every clone. The fix is `delete r.persistVars` rather than merely not setting it. *A fixture cloned
from live state inherits the thing you are trying to vary* — the same shape as build 1400's first probe,
which restored the same level and proved nothing because nothing had cleared it.

## The doorway carried the gear and lost the run (build 1415)

Found by asking what the gauntlet the user described actually needs — *"break out large rooms or levels
into separate json files ... a trigger that shows a loading message and then picks up the game with the
newly loaded scene"* — and then building it rather than reasoning about it.

Build 1394 made that door real for the PLAYER: weapons, ammo and HP cross it behind `keep`. **A gauntlet is
not made of weapons.** It is made of score, of which booths are finished, of the key from room one — all of
which live in `logicVars`, which `logicStart` clears on every level load. `_persistSeed` then puts back
whatever `campaignVars` holds, and **nothing but the level-CLEAR path had ever written `campaignVars`.**

Measured on a three-room campaign, with a clear as the control (`tools/probe/doorway-state.mjs`):

```
through a DOOR     score 12  ->  null     and the player arrived at room 1's checkpoint, (-55,-55)
through a CLEAR    score 30  ->  30       arriving at the room's own spawn
the INVENTORY      redKey    ->  redKey   <- the positive control
```

**The inventory surviving is what made both failures attributable.** Build 1227 writes items through on
pickup, so they already ride the blob and cross the door — which proves the persistence machinery works
across a transition and narrows the fault to the two things that waited for a commit.

The second row is the worse one and nobody had reported it: a doorway with no arrival tag **materialised
the player at the previous room's checkpoint coordinates**, which name a spot in a level that is no longer
loaded. Losing a score is annoying; arriving inside a wall is not recoverable.

### The fix is one call, because the function already did exactly the right two things

`_persistCommit` clears the checkpoint and carries the live variables. Its NAME says *the level was
CLEARED* and its comment said so too — but both behaviours are properties of **leaving**, and a doorway
leaves. So `goto` calls it. No second implementation, which is the defect this file records more than any
other; only the comment widened.

Three decisions:
- **Before the load.** `_campaignLoad` ends in `startGame`, which is where the clearing happens, so
  committing after it would carry forward values that had already been wiped.
- **After every refusal.** A `goto` that names a level outside the campaign must not clear a checkpoint on
  its way to doing nothing.
- **UNCONDITIONAL, deliberately not behind `keep`.** `persistVars` is *already* the creator's opt-in —
  they ticked "carry this between levels" — and requiring a second one would lose a hub world whose author
  ticked the box and used a plain `goto`. `keep` answers a different question (does the PLAYER arrive as
  they left, or re-equipped), which is why that one is a flag and this is not.

### The control failed first, and that was the instrument

The probe's first run reported the doorway losing the score **and the clear losing it too**, which proves
nothing at all. `persistVars` is level DATA, and the rooms had been serialized before it was set — so the
first load blanked it and both paths were measuring an empty list. Ticking it in each room's file (which is
what a creator does) made the control close and the finding appear. *A control that fails is the
instrument, not the finding* — recorded for the fourth time in this file, and it cost one run rather than a
published wrong conclusion.

**Backticks inside a template literal, for the ninth time** (1328, 1342, 1357), in a comment I added to the
probe *after* running the lint. The habit that actually fixes it: run `tools/probe/lint.mjs` after the last
edit, not before the first.

## The local-import path had no codecs (build 1419)

Reported from play: *"I get this error on some model imports — THREE.GLTFLoader: No DRACOLoader instance
provided."*

**The word SOME is the tell.** `_loadLocalModel` — build 1177's drag-and-drop import and 1348's picker —
constructed a **bare `new THREE.GLTFLoader`**, bypassing `_mkGLTFLoader`, which is the one function that
attaches the three optional codecs: KTX2 (917), meshopt (918) and Draco (1256). So a model you dragged in
carrying any of the three failed, with no retry, surfacing three's own raw message. Sketchfab and most
"optimize my glTF" pipelines emit Draco by default, which is exactly why it hits some imports and not
others.

Build 1256 wired Draco properly and its retry works — **on the hosted path only**. This is the same defect
shape this file records more than any other: one behaviour, two implementations, and only one maintained.
The helper existed for precisely this reason and one site did not call it.

**Two halves are needed and only one is the helper.** The decoders are LAZY — `_dracoLoader` is null until
the first model that needs one asks — so attaching what exists is not enough on the FIRST such model. The
hosted path solves that in `_ec`: read the codec named in the error, pull it in, retry. The local path now
does the same, against the same three needles, with a one-shot latch per codec so a decoder that genuinely
cannot be fetched reports rather than looping. The buffer is captured rather than re-read, so a retry needs
no second trip to IndexedDB.

Verified both ways. `test-1419` executes the real function with a fake loader through every branch (first
Draco model, all three codecs, one-shot, a decoder fetch that rejects, an ordinary corrupt file, a model
not on this device). And the shipped function driven in the running game with a real IndexedDB blob:

```
mkGLTFLoader -> parse:12 -> ensureDraco -> mkGLTFLoader -> parse:12  =>  ok
```

**The test asserts the property, not a count.** My first version required exactly one
`new THREE.GLTFLoader(` in the engine and failed at two — because `_mkGLTFLoader`'s own line is a ternary
and contains two. The property that was actually false is that every construction site lives INSIDE that
function, and that is what it checks now.

### The guard for this existed and had the right sentence attached to the wrong regex

`test-1177` has asserted, since the build that introduced the defect:

> *the local parse uses the SAME manager — KTX2/meshopt codecs and URL modifiers still apply*

…against `/new THREE\.GLTFLoader\(gltfManager\(\)\)/`. **That regex pinned the bare constructor — the
defect itself — while the sentence beside it named the very codecs the path was not getting.** Green for
242 builds, and the test's own title says "through the same loader/codec path as every model".

This is the SECOND occurrence in three builds: build 1417 moved `test-1132`'s *"a light switched off by a
signal does not hold a shadow slot"*, which had been true-as-intent with a regex quoting the code that
contradicted it. So it is a pattern, not a coincidence, and it has a rule now:

**When an assertion's message says "the SAME X as everything else", the regex must assert SAMENESS.**
Quoting one instance of X cannot — it will keep passing after that instance drifts away from the others,
which is precisely when the assertion becomes worth having. This file already records pins *satisfied* by
prose and pins *defeated* by prose; this is the third kind, where the message and the regex simply describe
different things.

## What a gauntlet-scale level costs, and one number nobody has explained (probe, after build 1420)

959 varied props — eight shapes at varied scales and rotations, which is what a showcase level is made of
and what defeats batching by colour. Draw calls and triangles, because wall-clock frame time under
SwiftShader has a noise floor bigger than anything being measured (build 1348 lost a feature to that).
Every row has a control that returns exactly. `tools/probe/gauntlet-scale.mjs`.

```
level              props   calls      tris  lights  colliders
stock                 59     174      6694      35         61
+100                 159     418     44758      47        161
+500                 559     881    120562      97        561
+900                 959    1327    195010     147        961

deployed (batched)   959     844    524582     147        961   <- what a PLAYER gets
lodPx 2              959     574    466806     147        961
lodPx 0 (control)    959     844    524582     147        961   <- returns exactly
```

Three things worth having:

- **Cost is linear, at 1.14 draw calls per added prop.** Nothing is superlinear; the collider grid, the
  spatial hash and the light budget all hold. A gauntlet-scale level is a big level, not a broken one.
- **Instancing runs at DEPLOY, not while authoring.** Every un-deployed row above is the EDITOR's cost, not
  the player's — measuring only that would have reported a price the shipped game never pays. Worth knowing
  before judging any prop-count number in this engine.
- **Screen-size culling is worth 57% of the draw calls on this level and is OFF by default** (build 1273
  set `lodPx` to 0 after an unreproducible report). A creator building at this scale has a large lever they
  have not been told about. `lodReport()` exists (1274) but says nothing when culling is off.

### And the number I could not explain

**Instancing cuts draw calls 36% and TRIPLES the triangles — 195,010 → 524,582.** Reproducible, with the
control returning byte-exact.

The obvious mechanism is build 1192's `frustumCulled = false` on every batch. That build set it
deliberately and recorded the reason: three derives a mesh's bounding sphere from its ORIGINAL geometry,
which for a batch is a unit box at the origin, so culling it would use the wrong bounds. The consequence,
which 1192 did not measure, is that a batch spread across the map is never culled AT ALL — while the
per-object props it replaced were frustum-culled individually.

**I could not confirm it.** r149's `InstancedMesh` has `computeBoundingSphere()`, which accounts for the
instance matrices, so the test was to compute it and enable culling. Every batch reported a bounding radius
of **-1** — the method gave back nothing usable — and the triangle count did not move. So the run proves
only that setting `frustumCulled = true` with no valid bounds changes nothing, which is not the question.

Stated rather than guessed, because this file's worst builds are the ones that shipped a plausible
mechanism instead of a measured one. What the next attempt needs is to find out WHY the bounding sphere
comes back empty before touching the flag. And note the likely ceiling on the win: eight batches each
spanning the whole field have spheres that cover everything, so correct bounds may cull nothing here —
spatially local batches would be a different and much larger change.

## Two questions asked and answered NO (probe pass after build 1420)

Both were pointed at the path a shipped gauntlet actually takes. Neither found a defect, and that is worth
recording — an unrecorded negative gets re-investigated.

**Does a level survive being SHARED?** `encodeLevel` is JSON → gzip → base64url, so the codec is lossless
by construction and there is nothing to lose. The interesting number is size, and it goes the good way:

```
level             props     JSON     code     LINK    gzip
stock                59   14,270    4,593    4,630    3.1x
+100                159   27,259    6,611    6,648    4.1x
+250                309   46,820    9,041    9,078    5.2x
+500                559   79,316   12,669   12,706    6.3x
```

**Compression IMPROVES with scale** — repeated prop structure is exactly what gzip eats — so a 559-prop
level is a 12.7 KB link. Two facts worth having: a URL hash is **never sent to a server**, so no
request-line limit applies; and the load path already handles a truncated link (`decodeLevel` throws,
the catch reports *"Shared level link looks invalid"*). What a share link does NOT fit inside is a chat
message — even the stock level's 4,630 characters exceed Discord's 2,000 — and the engine's answer to that
is build 972's instant `/game/` publish, which 1348 surfaced on the publish card. No change made.

**Does a saved level containing EVERY primitive boot?** This is the one that had teeth, because it has
shipped twice and a user found it both times: `loadHostedProps()` runs at module level and builds the saved
level's props before most of the file has evaluated, so a builder that reads a binding declared below the
table throws mid-load and strands every prop after it. Build 1331 (`FX_PRESETS`, an ambient emitter) and
build 1411 (`NET`, a world sign) are the two. 1331 wrote the rule down; nothing checked it.

`tools/probe/saved-level-boot.mjs` seeds a real saved level with one of every primitive, boots the real
game, and counts. **28 of 28.** The rule is being followed. It derives its list FROM the builder table, so
a primitive added later is covered without editing the probe.

### Three instrument failures, and the third is a lint that had been silent

| # | it reported | why |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 43 primitives including `crouch`, `sketchfab`, `tracer` | the slice ran to `function spawnProp`, thousands of lines past the table. **A slice is only as good as BOTH of its ends** — the character-budget trap wearing a different hat |
| 2 | 0 primitives built, 59 props | a saved level with NO props falls back to the engine's own default level, so an empty one is not a control: it never exercises the saved-level path at all. One box is |
| 3 | `1250` missing | the table carries `/* build 1250: emitters are props */`, and 1250 is not a primitive. Comments stripped |

#1 and #3 were both caught by a **shape guard in the probe itself** — it refuses to run when the extracted
list is implausible (too short, too long, missing `box` or `sign`, or containing a bare number) and prints
what it got. A probe that derives its own inputs needs to check them, or it measures a fiction confidently.

**And the probe lint had stopped checking a file without saying so** — until build 1413 made it say so.
`share-link-size.mjs` opens its page code with `async function(){`, which the opener regex did not
recognise, so the file was skipped. 1413's vacuous-run warning is what surfaced it; the opener now accepts
the async form, and the widening was self-tested by injecting a real backtick and confirming it still
fails. **Rollback #23 also landed during this pass** — same signature, same one-command recovery.

## Saving a level twice now produces the same level (build 1420)

Build 1418's round-trip probe found the colour decay and left four smaller differences behind. This closes
them — and **the four are not the point.** `tools/probe/level-roundtrip.mjs` is now BYTE CLEAN on a 58-key,
59-prop level carrying props with signals and locks and physics, all eight zone types, a shadow-casting
point light, spawn markers, pickups, five graph node kinds, lists, persistence, HUD widgets, weapon stats,
enemy mods, a wave manifest, animation slices and a cutscene. So it becomes a **standing guard**: any
future field that fails to survive a save fails there, instead of being discovered by a creator whose work
came back wrong.

**Two of the four were the engine and two were the probe's own fixture**, which is worth stating plainly
because all four looked identical in the diff:

| | |
|---|---|
| **engine** | `st.melee` wrote `true` on the first save and `1` on every one after it. `melee` lives as `true` on the factory table and as 0/1 everywhere else (1296 normalises where `GUN_BASE` is captured; `_wepApplyStats` clamps on load), so a straight `!==` against the baseline wrote two different files for one level |
| **engine** | `aimWep` grew a full seven-field ADS pose per weapon **simply from playing the level** — `getWeaponAim` creates the entry lazily on first aim — so a level saved after play differed from the same level saved before it, with 56 redundant numbers in between. Now only the poses a creator CHANGED are written, which is the same "only changed values" rule builds 1190, 1240 and 1296 already follow |
| fixture | a prop's health lives in `maxHp`; the fixture set `hp`, which the serializer does not read |
| fixture | widgets minted raw have no id and the serializer sanitizes into a COPY — but the editor's own Add button pushes through the sanitizer, so a real widget has an id from birth. **Not a defect** |
| fixture | `animCuts` fields are `n/s/a/b/f`; an unnamed slice is discarded by design |

**And the last difference of all was the fixture being ALIVE.** A dynamic physics crate settles between two
serializes, and its rotation reads exactly like format drift — the control showed it, which is the only
reason it was not published as decay. Every serialize in the probe now takes `resetDynamicProps()` first.
The crate stays dynamic, because `phys`/`mass`/`bounce` are real coverage; it just is not moving while
being measured. **A fixture that is still simulating is not a fixture**, recorded twice now.

The general lesson is about the SHAPE of the question. No feature owns "does the file survive a save", so
no feature test asks it — and three of this repo's worst silent-data-loss bugs (1162, 1280, 1325) were
found by accident rather than by asking. `serialize -> restore -> serialize` is idempotent or it is not,
the check needs no knowledge of what any field means, and it now runs against everything at once.

## A light's colour decayed to red, one save at a time (build 1418)

Found by asking a question no single-feature test asks, and that no feature owns: **is
`serialize -> restore -> serialize` idempotent?** Author a level that uses as much of the engine as one
level can, round-trip it, and diff the two serializations. Anything that differs is data the creator
authored and the engine dropped or mangled. `tools/probe/level-roundtrip.mjs`.

It found this. `ColorManagement.legacyMode = false` (build 1115) means `Color.setHex` runs the sRGB→linear
transfer on the way IN, so `color.r` is a LINEAR value — and `Math.round(color.r*255)` is not the byte the
creator authored, it is that byte pushed through a one-way curve. **Three sites did exactly that**, and two
of them fed the result straight back into `setHex`, which applies the curve again:

```
shipped   ffddaa -> ffb867 -> ff7a23 -> ff3204 -> ff0800 -> ff0100 -> ff0000
fixed     ffddaa -> ffddaa -> ffddaa -> ffddaa -> ffddaa -> ffddaa -> ffddaa
```

**A warm lamp becomes pure red in six saves, and this engine autosaves every 20 seconds.** Swept over all
256 byte values the shipped form is wrong for **254**; the fix for **none**. And `_lightOpts` feeds
`buildLight`, so *duplicating* a light did it too — the same decay in seconds rather than over a session.

**It rounds rather than calling `getHex()`.** Three's own method is the right conversion with the wrong
rounding (`clamp(r*255) << 16` truncates), which walks a colour one value darker per save — including a
full 255 channel, which lands a hair under 255.0 and truncates to 254. Worth recording that my first sweep
of that compared only the GREEN channel and reported "11 of 256"; the full-hex comparison is far worse. **A
sweep that varies one channel and checks that channel is not a sweep of the conversion.**

The editor's R/G/B sliders were the third site and were *self-consistent* — they read linear and wrote
linear (`setRGB` defaults to the working space), so they never drifted — but they showed 255,183,103 for a
lamp authored 255,221,170 and agreed with neither the level file nor any colour picker. All three now share
one conversion and its inverse.

**Honest limit:** a level saved before this build has the drifted value STORED. Loading it now holds that
value stable forever instead of degrading further, but the original colour is not recoverable — it was
destroyed by the save that wrote it.

### What the round-trip probe cost to build, and what that says about the fixture

Four instrument failures before one number was real, and every one is a fixture problem rather than an
engine one:

| # | it reported | why |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | the sign primitive did not exist | **container rollback #22.** The tree was at build 1382, which predates 1411's sign — and the rollback reverts `probe-out/` TOO, so the repo and the staging agreed and build 1414's hash guard was satisfied. **The guard detects disagreement, not recency** |
| 2 | `triggers is not defined` | the live arrays are not named after the serialized keys (`ZONE_TYPES` says `triggers`; the array is `triggerZones`). Read them, don't guess |
| 3 | `buildSpawnMarker` threw on `opts.t[0]` | it takes `t:[x,z]`, not `x`/`z`. Read a real call site |
| 4 | the control showed a prop ROTATING between two restores of the same bytes | the crate was a **dynamic physics body**. It was genuinely settling. A live fixture reads exactly like format drift |

#4 is the one to carry: **a fixture that is still simulating is not a fixture.** The control caught it,
which is the only reason the rotation numbers were not published as serialization decay.

**Backticks in a probe's page code for the tenth time — and the lint caught it this time**, which is the
first time that tool has paid for itself before a run was wasted. The habit it enforces is build 1415's:
run `tools/probe/lint.mjs` after the last edit, not before the first.

### Still open from that probe — CLOSED in build 1420

Four smaller differences remained and were deferred rather than folded into a colour fix. See below.

## A switched-off lamp was holding a shadow slot (build 1417)

Build 1414 recorded this and deliberately left it, because it is not a property of point lights: it is build
1132's shipped ranking, so it has applied to every signal-controlled **spot** since that build.

```js
const L = list[i].userData.light, on = i < n && list[i].userData.lon !== false;
```

`i` is the RANK. A lamp a signal had switched off occupied its place in the budget and resolved to "off" —
producing no shadow and denying the slot to a lit lamp behind it. Measured on four lamps in a line at a
budget of two, with the all-lit case as the control at both ends (`tools/probe/shadow-slot-dark.mjs`):

```
all lit          lit+SHADOW  lit+SHADOW  lit  lit    -> 2 casting
nearest two off  dark  dark  lit  lit                -> 0 casting   <- two lit lamps, no shadows
back on          lit+SHADOW  lit+SHADOW  lit  lit    -> 2 casting
```

**A corridor of switchable lamps went completely shadowless whenever the switch nearest the player happened
to be off.** Counting only the LIT ones toward the cap costs one local and fixes it.

**The second half is not a side note.** The caster count IS `NUM_POINT_LIGHT_SHADOWS` / `NUM_SPOT_LIGHT_SHADOWS`,
a `#define`, and build 1414 measured one change to it at **11 recompiled programs in a single frame**. Before,
walking past lamps that switch on and off moved the count between 0 and n; now it holds at `min(n, lit)` for
as long as the level has n lit casters anywhere. Across seven on/off patterns the total went from swinging to
**two distinct values, and zero of the patterns containing a lit lamp came out shadowless.**

**One pin's WORDING was already right while its regex pinned the defect.** `test-1132` has asserted *"a light
switched off by a signal does not hold a shadow slot"* since that build — a true statement of intent attached
to a regex quoting the code that contradicted it. The sentence is unchanged; what changed is that it is now
true. That is a third variety of the pin traps this file records: not a pin satisfied by prose, nor defeated
by it, but a pin whose MESSAGE and REGEX had drifted apart from each other.

## The point-light shadow was blocked by an instrument, not by a decision (build 1414)

Builds 1132 and 1348 both refused a point-light shadow and both were right on the evidence they had. 1348
went furthest: it tried to price the thing and **its frame-cost sweep failed its own control** — a 0-caster
baseline read 396 ms and the return to 0 read 554 ms — so it parked the feature and *said so*, rather than
shipping an expensive one on a measurement it did not believe. That entry's closing line was the right
instruction and this build followed it: **reproduce the failed sweep and get the control to close first.**

**What changed is the MEASURAND, not the patience.** A wall-clock frame under SwiftShader has a noise floor
larger than the effect. DRAW CALLS do not: they are integers, they are exactly what a shadow map costs, and
a control either returns to the baseline or the instrument is broken. `tools/probe/point-shadow-cost.mjs`,
scene paused, camera pinned, `renderer.info.reset()` per sample:

```
casters       0     1     2     4     0 (control)
calls       104   193   289   474   104     <- returns EXACTLY, which is what 1348 could not get
per caster        +89  +185  +370
median ms   1.1   1.7    —   651.1  34.0    <- the TIMING control still does not close. It never will here
```

That last row is worth keeping: the timing figure is reported for scale and **no decision rests on it**,
because its own control drifts 30×. The call counts decide, and they say **one point caster is +89 draw
calls** — linear in caster count.

**Two independent runs agreed on +89 to the call while their BASELINES differed** (104 and 173, by how much
of the level had finished loading). That is the linearity row doing its job: +89 is a property of the
caster, not of the frame it was measured in. Against a stock frame it is somewhere between half again and
double — the largest single thing a creator can add with one checkbox.

Worth knowing when reading that against *"a cube is six passes"*: +89 calls against **28** shadow-casting
meshes is **~3.2 effective passes, not 6**. Three frustum-culls each cube face and most of a level is
outside most faces. Six is the upper bound; 3.2 is what it costs here.

So the feature ships **capped hard**: `_maxPointShadows()` is 2 on desktop, **0 on a phone** (the device the
measurement says can least afford it), and 0 as soon as the resolution scaler engages — the same rung the
spot budget sheds on. `updateShadowLightBudget` now ranks and caps the two kinds **separately**, because one
shared cap of four would let two lamps quietly buy twelve depth passes out of a budget written for spots.

**And 1348's other finding is confirmed, not overturned:** the first flip of `castShadow` recompiled by
**11 programs** (69 → 80) — the *same delta* 1348 recorded as 54 → 65, so that build's recompile figure was
right all along and only its timing sweep was broken. `NUM_POINT_LIGHT_SHADOWS` is a `#define`. That is why the cap is a *ranking*
rather than a toggle — the budget only ever swaps WHICH lights cast while the COUNT stays at the cap, so a
player walking between lamps changes the set and not the define, which keeps this off builds
636/977/1153/1155's freeze path.

### The flag being set proves nothing — so it was measured on pixels

`tools/probe/point-shadow-blocks.mjs` builds a floor, a wall and one lamp at (200, 200) — outside `ARENA`,
build 1323's rule — zeroes every other light, and reads scene-linear radiance out of a `FloatType` target
with tone mapping off, sampling two points **projected** from world space rather than picked off a
screenshot (build 1151's rule):

```
              floor beside the lamp    floor behind the wall
shadow OFF          0.37057                  0.09524     <- the lamp shines straight through
shadow ON           0.37057                  0.02312     <- 75.7% darker
shadow OFF          0.37057                  0.09524     <- the control returns
```

**The lit side moving 0.0% is the whole assertion.** If both columns had moved, the frame merely got darker
and the measurement would be worthless; only the shadowed side moving means the wall is an occluder.

### The staleness guard was blind for the entire life of every build

The first run of that probe reported `wantShadow false` and three's default 0.5/500 shadow camera — which
reads exactly like the new code being broken. It was measuring **build 1413**.

Build 1389 added a guard for precisely this (a probe staged during a rollback answered questions about code
no longer in the tree) and keyed it on **`BUILD_VERSION`** — a value this project's workflow bumps **LAST**,
after the edits, the probes and the suite. So from the first edit of a build until its final commit, the
repo and the staging carry the *same version string* and *different code*, and the guard reports fresh.
Every probe run during development measured the previous build, silently, since 1389.

The stamp is a **content hash** now, with the version beside it as a label. Proven by the failure it was
blind to: the guard refused a staging whose version string was identical to the repo's.

**The general rule: a freshness check keyed on a value the workflow updates last is not a freshness check.**

### Recorded rather than changed — and then changed, in build 1417

A light a signal switched **off** still occupied its rank in the budget (`on = i < n && lon !== false`), so a
dark lamp held a shadow slot a lit one further away could have used. That is build 1132's shipped shape,
identical for spots, and correcting it was its own build with its own reasoning rather than a side effect of
adding a light type. **That build is 1417** — see below. `test-1414`'s assertion inverted when it landed,
which is what a recorded backlog item being picked up rather than forgotten looks like.

## The shadow patches are verified to land (build 1381)

Build 1380 shipped three `.replace` calls on three's own chunks **unguarded**, and its test checked their
anchors against PRISTINE three. By the time they run, `lights_fragment_begin` has already been rewritten
TWICE — build 1364's visible-guard and build 1185's cascade select — so the test could pass while the
engine's own replace missed. That is this file's most-repeated failure shape, and 1364 had already written
the answer down four builds earlier.

**HALF is worse than none**, which is why the two chunks are now committed together behind one flag:

| what lands | what happens |
|---|---|
| function, not call site | PCSS is dead code. Silent — every material compiles and the frame renders |
| call site, not function | `getShadowPCSS` is UNDEFINED and **every lit material in the engine** fails to compile |

The needle is named ONCE (`_PCSS_CALL`) and used by the guard and by both ternary branches, because a guard
that checks a different string from the one the replace uses is not a guard. An anchor that has become
AMBIGUOUS counts as missing too — two matches would patch both sites and is not "landed". A failure warns
by name and says what to look for, and `_fitSunShadow` refuses to derive a scale, so `pcssP.x` can never be
non-zero for a shader with no `getShadowPCSS` in it.

**The build found a live syntax error in itself while being written.** The call is built as
`'getShadowPCSS' + _PCSS_CALL.slice(n)`, and the first draft used `n = 10` where `'getShadow'.length` is
**9** — which drops the `(` and emits `getShadowPCSS directionalShadowMap[ i ], ...`, a GLSL syntax error
in a chunk included by every lit material. It was caught by PRINTING the generated string instead of
assuming it, and `test-1381` now derives `n` from the name's own length and checks the result's parens
balance. Two pins moved in 1380, both quoting the literal call text that became a construction.

## A shadow's softness is the distance to what cast it (build 1380)

Every shadow in the engine had the SAME edge softness whatever cast it, because PCF samples a fixed radius
— `shadowRadius` texels, everywhere. Real shadows do not work that way: the penumbra grows with the
distance between the occluder and the receiver, which is why a chair leg is razor-sharp where it meets the
floor and a roofline three storeys up is a soft band. One softness reads as either *cut out with scissors*
or *everything is out of focus*.

**Builds 1341, 1345 and 1346 all spent themselves on the artifacts of the first choice** — the normal bias,
then the depth bias, then the map resolution — without ever questioning the model underneath them. This
build changes the model. PCSS is three passes over the map three already renders: search for blockers,
estimate the penumbra from how far away they are, PCF at THAT radius.

Four decisions, each of which is a defect without it:

- **Only the NEAR cascade.** The call site is patched with `UNROLLED_LOOP_INDEX == 0`, so light 0 gets PCSS
  and the far cascade, every spot light and every point light keep three's own `getShadow` untouched. The
  far cascade's texel is 4× coarser by design and covers geometry where a penumbra is under a pixel — and a
  **spot's shadow camera is PERSPECTIVE**, so the depth-to-world scale derived below would be wrong for it.
- **`pcssP.x == 0` returns `getShadow` VERBATIM.** Off is not a cheap approximation of on; it is the shipped
  1346 path, called. That is what makes it safe to shed on the adaptive ladder (build 1350's rule that a
  perf *add* needs a way out) and what makes shedding it exactly free.
- **The disc is COMPUTED, not stored.** GLSL ES 1.0 cannot index a const array with a loop variable, and a
  golden-angle Vogel spiral (build 1247's bokeh disc) needs no array at all. `sqrt` radius, so it is uniform
  over the disc rather than centre-heavy.
- **The scale is derived on the CPU**, inside `_fitSunShadow`, where the extent, the depth range and the map
  size already live — so the shader carries arithmetic instead of a second copy of the shadow fit:
  `penumbraTexels = depthGap × (far − near) × tan(sunRadius) / texel`.

`SUN_ANGLE_TAN = 0.020` against the real sun's **0.0047**. At life size the penumbra is under one texel for
anything but a very tall occluder — it would measure as no change at all. At 0.020 an occluder 10 m above
its receiver casts a ~7-texel (20 cm) penumbra while one touching the ground gets the 1-texel floor, which
IS the contact hardening.

### Measured — and the first four runs measured nothing but the HUD

```
                    world pixels moved by >6      mean |d|
control  0 vs 0              0.000%                0.0047
shipped  (tan 0.020)         0.232%                0.0396
3x                           0.842%                0.1376
10x                          1.566%                0.3017
```
Monotonic in amplitude, replicating to four significant figures across an independent repeat, with the
control returning to zero. 0.232% is small because **shadow edges are a small fraction of any frame** —
that is what this build touches and all it should touch. Stated rather than inflated.

Verified on the real GPU path before any of that: **65 programs compiled, `glGetError` 0, zero shader
console output, frame not black.** A GLSL error in a chunk patch takes down every lit material in the
engine, and this file has lost a subsystem to a silent shader failure twice.

### Three instrument failures, and the second is a standing rule

| # | it reported | why |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | effect 5.14% against a control of 7.34% — a clean null | the **HUD** was inside the window. The minimap dots, the wave banner and the coach pill animate, and they were the entire noise floor. Excluding them took the control from 1.14% of pixels >6 to **0.000%** |
| 2 | a **10× amplitude** produced exactly the same 5.06% | `_fitSunShadow` REWRITES `_pcssP.x` every frame, so the probe's assignment was undone before the next render and **both conditions rendered identically**. Pinned with `Object.defineProperty` instead |
| 3 | — | `paused = true` is what makes any of this measurable at all: in a running game the scene is the noise floor, and it is far larger than any shading change worth making |

**#2 is build 1345's lesson arriving again, in a build that quotes it**: *know who else writes what you are
setting.* The frame loop owns the camera, the shadow fit owns `normalBias` — and now it owns this too.

**And the uniform is the half that would have made the whole build a silent no-op.** `ShaderLib` merged
`UniformsLib` at module load (build 1181), so adding to the lib alone reaches nothing already built and
`seqWithValue` silently drops a program uniform with no value — `pcssP` would have sat at GL zero forever,
which reads exactly like the feature working correctly with itself turned off.

## The props stop being one flat colour (build 1379)

Build 1139 built the procedural detail set and deliberately left ALBEDO out of it, for a reason that is
exactly right **about textures**: *"an albedo map cannot be exposure-neutral. It multiplies the material
colour, so it only darkens — neutrality would need values above 255."* None of that is true of a **shader
term**, which has no 8-bit ceiling: `mix(1-a, 1+a, field)` goes above 1.0 as freely as below it, so the mean
albedo — the quantity every level's lighting was tuned against — does not move. That is the whole reason
this can be retrofitted onto colours creators already chose, which is what 1139 concluded was impossible.

1145 had already built the machinery: `onBeforeCompile` on three's own `MeshStandardMaterial`, an
object-space hashed noise field, one shared program. This adds one `.replace` to it and a second mode.

**Who gets it is a DIFFERENT question from who gets relief.** `objDetailWanted` refuses a mesh with UVs
because "the texture path serves it there" — true for relief and roughness, and false for albedo, because
`PROC_SLOTS` is `normalMap` + `roughnessMap` and carries no albedo at all. So a UV-having, textureless mesh
was exactly as flat as a UV-less one, and low-poly packs ship those constantly. `albedoDetailWanted` asks
only "standard material, no authored `map`" — a creator's own albedo always wins.

### Measured, on real pixels, with a control that returns

```
                unique colours    frame mean    exposure drift
alb 0            26,116  1.000x      88.075         0.000%
alb 0.16         26,488  1.014x      88.055        -0.023%
alb 0.30         26,787  1.026x      88.032        -0.048%   <- shipped
alb 0.45         27,027  1.035x      88.005        -0.079%
alb 0 (control)  26,137  1.001x      87.993        -0.093%
```

Two things that table settles. **The control returns to 1.001x**, so the whole 3.5% is the term and not
drift. And **the exposure movement the term causes is smaller than the scene's own settling at every
amplitude** — that is the neutrality claim measured rather than argued. 0.30 is the knee: 0.16→0.30 nearly
doubles the gain, 0.30→0.45 adds a third as much again for 50% more swing.

`test-1379` proves the neutrality independently by **porting the shipped GLSL into JS and integrating it**
— the field measures 0.5 over 216,000 samples, so the multiplier's mean is 1.0 — and asserts the three
`.replace` anchors against the real `ShaderLib.physical.fragmentShader`, because a replace that misses is a
silent no-op that renders a perfectly plausible frame.

### The density is a pixel-subtense argument

The first cut used 5.5 cycles per metre. **That measures as nothing at the range the game is played at**: the
broad octave's period is 18 cm, which at 40 m across a 78-degree frame is well under one pixel, so it
averages straight back to the flat colour it was there to break up while costing a full noise evaluation per
fragment. At **0.9/m** the broad octave is ~1.1 m — the scale of an architectural panel, which is what reads
across a room — and the field's second octave (3.1x, ~36 cm) carries it up close.

Frequency is per WORLD METRE, not per object: build 1139's *"UV tiling is not a physical size"* one layer
down. A 22 m deck and a 1 m crate otherwise read as two differently-zoomed photographs of one material.
`retileProcSurface` already owns each prop's world span, so the density rides the hook that keeps the grain
honest through a gizmo scale — gated on `_odSpan` so it never overwrites an imported mesh's own
bounding-box-normalised frequency (1145).

### Two silent failures, both found by probing and neither by the suite

- **A uniform written before its shader exists is a write to nothing.** The frequency lived only in
  `shader.uniforms`, which `onBeforeCompile` creates at the material's first RENDER — and a prop's real span
  is set at SPAWN, before that. Probed on the stock level: all 57 prop materials were correctly patched and
  every single one still carried the frequency for a **1 m** object, including a 16 m deck. It is stored on
  the material now and the uniform reads it at compile time.
- **`!mat.onBeforeCompile` is always false.** three declares `onBeforeCompile` as a no-op on
  `Material.PROTOTYPE`, so it is truthy on every material ever made and the batch re-apply — which exists
  because `Material.copy()` does not carry it, 1139's own trap one layer along — never ran. `hasOwnProperty`
  is the question that actually distinguishes them, and both facts are now asserted against the real build.

Every source pin in this build passed while both of those were live. **A test that pins the two ends of a
wire proves nothing about the wire** (build 1277), and the probe is what closed it.

### Four instrument failures before one number was real

| # | what it said | why it was wrong |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | props gained 0.96x / 0.99x / 0.98x unique colours — a null | two separate capture RUNS, so auto-exposure and settling differed; and the ground, which this build does not touch, moved 1.36x |
| 2 | mint block -2.25% under the term | the same-condition control drifted -3.9%. The effect was inside it, ordered by CAPTURE TIME (build 1152's failure #5, verbatim) |
| 3 | the A/B region read mean 45 where the capture read 114 | the probe never posed the camera, so the coordinates were for a frame it was not looking at — build 1124, again |
| 4 | control: **99.25% of pixels differ between two frames of the SAME condition** | the world was LIVE — wave, enemies, coach pill, minimap. No screenshot diff of this scene can mean anything until it is paused |

`paused = true` is what made every number above possible. **In a running game, the scene is the noise
floor**, and it is far larger than any material change worth making.

## The stock level has an albedo (build 1378)

Every one of the six AAA critics named this first, in different words: *"a very good engine with no art
department"*, *"technically literate and it still does not read as a real place"*. The cause is one line of
data — `floorTex:''` and `wallTex:''` in `DEFAULT_WORLD`. The ground plane and the four boundary walls, which
between them are most of the pixels in the first frame anybody sees, were **flat colour**. No lighting change
can fix that, and none of builds 1126–1377's rendering work could show on a surface with no detail in it.

The generator has shipped a procedural texture library the whole time (`node tools/levelgen.mjs tex <id>
<out.png>`, build 1110's fast-iteration path). Nothing had ever pointed the engine's own two surfaces at it.

**The url is the trivial half. The value structure is the build.** An albedo `map` MULTIPLIES the material
colour — build 1139 measured that and recorded *"an albedo map cannot be exposure-neutral… it only darkens"*
— so dropping concrete (linear mean **0.366**) onto build 1360's tuned floor would have taken 63% of the
frame's ground albedo away and silently invalidated everything derived from it: the exposure, 1149's bounce
factor, 1156's horizon match, and the auto-exposure that would then have lifted the whole frame back up and
flattened it. So the base colours are **compensated**, `newColour_linear = oldColour_linear / textureMean`:

```
              tuned (1360)   texture mean          now      drawn albedo   error
floor  0x403d39  0.0513/0.0467/0.0409   0.366/0.367/0.356   0x69645f   0.0517/0.0468/0.0407   +0.9/+0.2/-0.5%
wall   0x3a454b  0.0423/0.0595/0.0704   0.355/0.355/0.343   0x61727d   0.0424/0.0597/0.0703   +0.3/+0.3/-0.0%
```

**Within 1% per channel, so build 1360's staging is preserved exactly and the surface gains its variation for
free.** The compensation has headroom to exist at all only because those albedos are dark: the compensated
floor sits at 0.140 linear, well under 1.0. On a bright surface this trade is not available, which is the
other half of 1139's finding.

`test-1378` **re-derives that from the PNGs that ship** — decoding them and linearising per pixel before
averaging (1151's rule: `toBytes` writes the sRGB fraction with no transfer and the map is sRGB-tagged) — and
asserts the product lands on 1360's numbers. Regenerating a texture at a different brightness without
re-deriving the colour fails there rather than silently re-exposing the first frame of the game.

### Tiling is a size, and the wall was stretched 17:1

Build 1139: *"UV tiling is not a physical size."* The auto repeats never got that message — the floor's was
`ARENA/4` and the wall's `ARENA/8`, **ratios of the arena's own extent**, so one tile covered proportionally
more metres in a bigger level. Worse, a boundary wall's wide face is `ARENA*2 × H` = **140 m by 8 m** and both
axes took the same repeat: any creator who had ever put a texture on the boundary got it stretched 17:1.

`SURF_TILE_M = 4` is named once and `_surfRepeat(spanM)` divides a real span by it, per axis — floor from
`ARENA*2`, wall U from `ARENA*2` and wall V from `H`. A tile is now the same size in metres in every level and
on every face. This corrects existing levels that used auto tiling *and* a texture; the floor moves 17.5 → 35
repeats and the wall's V axis 8.75 → 2, which is the stretch going away.

**The mood had to state it too.** `groundMood` (levelgen) owns a generated theme's ground — that is build
1143's whole point — and it named only the colours. With the stock world now carrying a texture, generating an
arena would have left concrete multiplying a theme's ground, 0.37× darker than the albedo the lightmap bake
integrated. It states `floorTex:''`/`wallTex:''` explicitly now. Naming a value once is not the same as
deriving it; the six slots are asserted in `test-1378`.

**Two harnesses failed and both were right to.** 1156 and 1360 read `DEFAULT_WORLD.floorColor` as *the floor's
albedo*, which it stopped being the moment a map multiplied it. Every luminance claim in them is about the
albedo the surface **draws**, so both now derive it — through one shared `tests/albedo.mjs`, because three
copies of a derivation is how the thing being derived stops agreeing with itself. Their assertions are
untouched in intent and are now stronger: they test the frame rather than a factor of it.

### Two process failures, both mine, one destructive

- **`open(path,'w').write(rep(path,…))` EMPTIES THE FILE.** Python opens (and truncates) the target before it
  evaluates the argument that reads it, so `tools/levelgen.mjs` went to **0 bytes**. It is tracked, so
  `git checkout --` cost nothing — but the same shape against an untracked file is unrecoverable. Compute the
  new text into a variable **first**, then open for writing. The scripted-edit convention in this file exists
  for exactly this class and did not cover it; it does now.
- **The eleventh container rollback, and the first to land mid-session.** The tree reverted from 1377 to 1353
  between two of my own commands. `git fetch` + `reset --hard FETCH_HEAD` restored everything, because every
  build is pushed the moment it lands. What did NOT survive were **uncommitted probe tools** — the capture
  rig had to be rebuilt once already for this reason. Anything worth using twice belongs in a commit, not in
  the working tree.

## Texture memory is visible, and the AO sweep stopped allocating (build 1353)

**1. The cost a creator could not discover.** Build 1257 made the LIGHT count visible on the grounds that it
is the number a creator "most needs and could least discover", and the audit's texture half was never done.
The gap is specific: the asset panel reports **download** bytes (build 990's inventory) and
`renderer.info.memory.textures` is a **count**. Neither is what runs a phone out of memory — a 4096×4096
albedo costs **~85 MB on the GPU** however small the JPEG was.

```
1024² no mipmaps   4.00 MB      w·h·4
1024² + mipmaps    5.33 MB      ×4/3 — the 1 + ¼ + 1/16 … series, not a guess
4096² + mipmaps   85.33 MB      the number the census exists to show
```

Three things it has to get right, all measured live:
- **It walks the SCENE, not just the two caches.** An imported GLB's own maps are in neither `texCache` nor
  `_texInst` and are most of a big level. Verified: a material-only 2048² that is in neither cache added
  exactly its 21 MB.
- **A texture shared by ten materials counts once.** Eight materials on one texture moved the count by 1.
- **A compressed texture is counted as its real transcoded length**, not 4 bytes a pixel. Charging KTX2/Basis
  the uncompressed rate would libel the one format that actually fixes this problem.

It reports nothing below the cap, because a panel that always complains is not read (1274), and it names the
distinction that makes the number surprising — *"this is GPU memory, not download size"* — plus the control
that fixes it rather than only scolding.

Worth knowing when reading the two figures side by side: the census reports **14 textures / 5 MB** on the
stock level while three reports **26**. The difference is render targets and the engine's own internal
textures, which three counts and this deliberately does not — the question is what the CONTENT costs.

**2. Build 1168's last transients.** That build hoisted this file's per-frame allocations and named what it
did not finish. All **four** `_aoHideNoDepth` call sites still allocated a fresh array every frame, with AO
and motion blur both live — the exact class 1168 removed everywhere else.

**Four buffers, not one shared scratch.** The four fills are sequential *today* — each is filled, rendered
and drained before the next begins — so one would work, and that is precisely build 1168's own warning: *"a
shared scratch would be clobbered the day that order matters."* One per consumer costs three empty arrays
for the life of the page and cannot be broken by reordering the passes. The function now clears the buffer
on entry, since the callers reuse it; without that every frame would re-show a growing list of objects that
are already visible.

The registry 1168 actually wanted — a transparent-material registry replacing the traverse — is still the
bigger idea and still open. This was the cheap half it also named.

## The graph can ask WHERE, and a campaign can branch (build 1352)

Two gaps the gameplay audit named, both small because the machinery was already there.

**1. Where something is.** The graph could MOVE a prop (1170), SHOVE one (1258) and be told when one
entered a zone (1276) — and could never ask where one WAS. "The ball is on your half", "the crate is within
3 m of the plinth", "how far is the player from the exit" were all unaskable, which is most of what a
sports level or a physics puzzle is made of.

`_lgPlaceAt` already resolves a tag — and `me`, `start`, `#here` — to world coordinates, so `propx / propy /
propz / propdist` are that resolver plus arithmetic. **The same vocabulary the place field has always
used**, which is why it needs no new autocomplete list and why the tag box reuses the existing `item` param
keyed by stat rather than adding one that sits unused for every other stat.

Two decisions: distance is **horizontal**, because a creator asking "how close is it" means across the
floor and a prop on a shelf is not further away; and every value is **rounded to 2 dp**, because a graph
COMPARES these and an unrounded float never equals anything with `==`. A tag nobody carries **reports**
rather than reading 0 forever — reading 0 looks exactly like "it is at the origin", which is build 1214's
whole point.

**2. Go to level.** A campaign was strictly linear: `_campaignLoad(i)` is a single index load and the only
transition in the engine is `campaignIdx++` on clear. Hub worlds, level select, branching routes and "you
failed, back to the tutorial" were all inexpressible.

Four guards, each of which is a silent bug without it: a client never loads on its own (two peers in
different worlds); firing outside a campaign reports rather than doing nothing; the index is range-checked
because `n` comes out of a level file, which is untrusted input (1325), and `campaign.levels[999]` is
`undefined` that `_campaignLoad` would swallow; and the interstitial is cleared first or a jump during one
leaves the card stuck on screen. The field is **1-based** because that is what the campaign list shows the
creator — the array is 0-based, and getting that backwards is a whole-level off-by-one nobody would suspect.

### I shipped build 1277's defect into my own draft, and the probe caught it

`goto` went into the `do` verb dropdown while being implemented as a node type. `do` routes everything
through `_applySignalAction`, which knows nothing about levels — so the node resolved, nothing loaded, and
`campaignIdx` never moved. **That is exactly the defect build 1277 found across six prop verbs that had
shipped and never worked**, and the reason it did not ship again is that the probe drives the real
`_lgPulse` switch rather than asserting the dropdown and the handler separately.

It is its own node now, beside `win` and `lose`, which are the same class of run-level verb. And build
1028's palette↔runtime parity test — which exists for precisely this — failed on the node count until
`goto` was added to its list, at which point it also began asserting `case 'goto':` exists. **The test
caught the same mistake a second time, from the other direction.**

Measured through the real switch, a tagged prop at (12, 3.5, −8) with the player at the origin:

```
propx 12 · propy 3.5 · propz -8 · propdist 14.42 (= hypot(12,8)) · "me" -> the player's own x
missing tag -> 0 AND a reported failure
goto: not-in-campaign / out-of-range / zero  -> three distinct reports, nothing loaded
goto 3 of 3 -> loadedIndex 2, campaignIdx 2   ·   as a client -> nothing loaded
```

## A way to report something (build 1351 — platform audit G2)

The platform audit's named blocker for a public release with minors, and the cheapest high-value item in
it: **there was no report affordance anywhere in the product.** Chat had build 1178's 11-word filter applied
at render and a per-session `/mute`, and that was the entire safety surface — a player who saw something
worse had no way to tell anybody, and a moderator had no queue to read.

The server half is `server/api/report.php` (written alongside; see the correction under build 1350 for how
it reached the tree). This is the half a person can reach.

**A chat report must carry the message.** Chat is peer-to-peer, so the server has **no copy** of the line
being reported — a report naming only a player is an unactionable accusation. `report.php` refuses a chat
report with no `text` for exactly that reason, and the client sends the line and the room code. This is the
one design point that makes the feature real rather than decorative.

**It must fail loudly when there is no backend.** Reports go to the founder's host, which a self-hoster or
an offline session does not have. *"Could not reach the moderation service — your report was NOT sent"* is
the whole point: a silent swallow is worse than no button, because the reporter believes they have been
heard. Success also requires BOTH `r.ok` and `j.ok` — an HTML error page served with status 200 is not a
delivered report.

Verified live against a stubbed endpoint through every branch:

```
sent        {kind:chat, reason:harassment, target:"Griefer", text:"something awful", room:"ab12cd"}
            -> "Reported — thank you. A moderator will look at it."
429         -> "You have reported very recently — try again in 37s"   (retry comes from the server)
400         -> "Could not send the report: bad kind"
no backend  -> "Could not reach the moderation service — your report was NOT sent"
cancel      -> zero requests
your own chat line -> no flag at all
```

`uiPromptForm` gained an options-driven `<select>`, additively: a field with no `options` builds exactly
the text input every existing caller already gets, and both land in the same `inputs` array so the
callback's value-order contract is unchanged. A free-text "reason" would have been useless to a moderator
and `report.php` whitelists it anyway. **I nearly shipped a dialog that assumed a select and named keys —
`uiPromptForm` had neither.** Reading the helper before calling it is what caught it.

**Seven times.** Three harnesses (852, 854, 857) broke on `{0,9500}` character-budget slices of the
community gallery, every assertion still true. All three were anchored at BOTH ends on named functions, so
the budget was never doing anything except waiting to expire; they are unbounded lazy matches now. That is
the trap CLAUDE.md records under build 1149, hit for the seventh time in this session alone.

**Still open on G2:** the report button exists on chat lines and community levels; the published `/game/`
page and in-match players do not have one yet.

## The sun shadow joins the ladder (build 1350 — debt build 1346 created)

Build 1346 raised the near cascade to 4096 for a measured reason: the corner leak is a fixed number of
TEXELS wide, so halving the texel halved it, at ~12% of frame time. What that build did **not** do is give
the cost a way out. `SUN_SHADOW_PX` was a constant, so the adaptive ladder could shed motion blur, then
MSAA and SSAO, then a third of the pixels — while the biggest single draw in the frame stayed at 4096 the
whole way down.

That is **build 1263's lesson from the other side**: a perf change may not remove work something else
relies on, and it may not ADD work with no shed path. 1346 is the same author making the second mistake a
few builds after recording the first.

Measured live, sweeping the rung and reading the real light list:

```
rung            0      1      2      3      0
sun map      4096   2048   2048   1024   4096
lights         35     35     35     35     35     <- never moves
dir casters     2      2      2      2      2     <- never moves
programs (warm) 69     69     69     69     69
```

**Resizing a shadow map compiles nothing, and the control is what proves it.** With the resize neutered and
the map pinned, the program count still climbed 66 → 69 on a cold cache; with the resize live and the cache
warm it is flat at 69 across every rung. So the growth was warm-up, not the change.

Three things it must never touch, and the test asserts all three:
- **`castShadow`** — that is `NUM_DIR_LIGHT_SHADOWS`, a `#define`, and flipping it recompiles every
  material. It is precisely why build 1348 could *not* do this for point lights: `mapSize` is an
  allocation, `castShadow` is a program variant.
- **`.visible`** — build 977's trap; an invisible light is still uncounted, so toggling it moves the count.
- **`moonFar`** — its texel is 4× coarser by design and it covers geometry where a corner artifact is under
  a pixel. Shedding it would change the caster count for nothing.

**The temporal dead zone here was handled explicitly rather than behind a catch.** `_applyPixelRatio()`
runs at BOOT, ~1,500 lines before `moon` and `SUN_SHADOW_PX` are declared, and `typeof` does **not** guard
a TDZ — build 1127 lost the sky for eight builds to exactly that, behind a `catch` that hid it. My first
draft had the identical shape (`typeof moon==='undefined'` inside a `try`). It is a `_sunShadowReady` flag
raised where the light is actually built; the catch remains only as a backstop and is not what makes it
correct.

Hooked into `_applyPixelRatio` because that function *already means* "the rung moved" — it is called on
every downshift, every climb and the adaptive-off restore, so there is no second list of call sites to keep
in step. Two pins moved (50, 123), both of which quoted that function's whole body.

### A process correction to build 1349's record

Build 1349's commit `c058885` also contains `server/api/report.php`, `_community_lib.php`, `submit.php` and
`admin.php` — the moderation backend — because a `git add -A` swept them in while they were being written
alongside. The code in that commit is the finished, tested version and nothing needs reverting, but the
commit message describes none of it. Recorded here rather than by rewriting pushed history. **The lesson is
the ordinary one: `git add -A` is not safe when anything else is writing to the tree.**

## The Sketchfab token is lent by choice, not by default (build 1349 — multiplayer audit G6)

The multiplayer audit's sharpest verified own-goal, and it is a one-condition fix. The host's **personal
Sketchfab API token** was packed into the WELCOME message of every match whose level referenced a
`sketchfab:` model — and room codes are published in the lobby directory, so anyone who could join received
it. `_sfPack` is a fixed XOR plus base64 whose **decoder ships in the same file**; the comment beside it
always admitted it is obfuscation, not encryption.

**The feature is legitimate and stays.** Without a token a joiner sees holes where the level's models
should be. What was wrong is that it happened SILENTLY and BY DEFAULT. Handing over a credential is a
decision, and the person whose quota it is has to be the one making it.

So `sfLendEnabled()` gates the send, and it **fails closed** in both directions that matter: an unset key
reads false, so every existing host stops lending the moment they take this build, and a storage exception
also returns false — if we cannot tell, we do not hand over the credential.

**The control sits with the token, not in a settings screen somewhere else.** The moment you are choosing
Sketchfab models is the moment the trade is legible. Both states name their real consequence, because a
consent prompt that only describes one side is not a choice:

- on — *"joiners can load this level's Sketchfab models, and can also spend your Sketchfab API quota while
  the match lasts"*
- off — *"your token stays with you. Joiners will see holes where this level's Sketchfab models should be,
  unless they add their own token."*

`_sfPack` itself is untouched: this build changes **whether**, not how. And the test asserts the property
that would have caught the original defect — `_sfPack` is referenced exactly twice (its definition and the
one send site), and that send site is gated on consent. A second, ungated packing site is the only way this
comes back.

One pin moved (326), which quoted the condition verbatim; its intent — shared only when the level needs it
and the host has one — is unchanged and now stricter, so it asserts the members.

## Three capabilities that existed and could not be found (build 1348)

None of this adds an ability. Each item adds a **door** to something already shipped — which is the
difference between having a feature and having a product.

**1. Local `.glb` import was invisible, and on touch it was impossible.** Build 1177 added it and reached
it from exactly one place: a viewport DROP handler. So the only string in the product that mentioned it was
the FAILURE toast you get after dropping the wrong kind of file — *you had to already know, and get it
wrong, to be told.* And a tablet has no drag-and-drop at all: both `input[type=file]` in the file accept
`.rumpus,.breach,.json`, i.e. LEVELS, so for a touch creator the feature did not exist. `_pickLocalModel`
is one `<input type="file" accept=".glb,.gltf">` into the **same** `_importLocalModel` — a door, not a
second code path, so it cannot drift from the drop route.

**2. A point light shines through walls and never said so.** Build 1132 allowed a placed light to cast a
shadow only for spot and directional, for a real reason: a point light's shadow is a cube map, six depth
passes for one lamp. But the checkbox was simply **absent** for a point light with no explanation.
Measured on the shipped stock level: **29 point lights, ZERO casting.** That is not an edge case, it is
what every level looks like — and it is a much larger "light leaks into my room" than any shadow-map
hairline.

Two measurements decided *explain* over *implement*, and both are recorded at the site:
- Flipping `castShadow` at runtime **recompiles — 54 → 65 programs in one frame.** So a point shadow could
  never be a live toggle; it would arrive as builds 636/977/1153/1155's freeze by a second door and would
  have to be decided at deploy like `enforceEmitterCap`.
- The frame-cost sweep **failed its own control** — the 0-caster baseline read 396 ms and the return to 0
  read 554 ms. There is no honest cost figure to ship a cube shadow against, and shipping an expensive
  feature on a broken measurement is how this file's worst builds happened. So the panel names the
  consequence and the fix (use a Spot) and the implementation waits for a build that can measure it.

**3. The fastest way to share was filed under the wrong noun *and* hidden behind another feature's
toggle.** Build 972's instant `/game/` publish gives a live URL in seconds with no review queue, and its
only button lived inside the "Title screen" section — which is where you go to set a logo. Verified while
building this: it is also inside `#hpFields`, which is `display:none` until the **Custom title screen**
checkbox is ticked. The audit found the first half; the probe found the second.

The link on the publish card **reveals** the real control rather than duplicating the publish logic, and
when the prerequisite is unmet it scrolls to the CHECKBOX rather than to a button that would refuse — a
game page *is* the title screen, and `hpPublish` says "turn on the custom title screen first". It never
ticks it on the creator's behalf. Revealing a control that will refuse is the same dead click build 1147
removed.

### And a latent bug found while verifying #3

**Build 1293 broke build 1320's reveal helper and nothing connected the two.** 1293 stopped building any
section whose `offsetParent === null` and made the fold-toggle HANDLER responsible for re-rendering on
expand. `_edRevealHost` uncollapses the section **directly**, so it never went through that handler and
could reveal an empty fold — including build 1320's own `Model…` menu entry, which has been landing on
unbuilt content since 1293 shipped. It re-renders now, in the order uncollapse → build → scroll, because
scrolling to an unbuilt fold lands nowhere.

Verified in the real editor rather than by flag-setting (builds 1264/1268 shipped a fix into a branch no
creator reaches, twice): the picker button renders and opens a `.glb`-only input; a placed point light's
panel reads *"This light shines through walls"* and names Spot; the publish link sits inside the publish
card, and clicking it opens the Title screen section with the toggle on screen and the publish row still
hidden — then ticking the toggle brings `Publish game page (instant URL)` into view.

## The keyboard reaches the editor (build 1347 — the accessibility census, 4/6)

Build 1334 left the census at three-for-six and named what remained: `role=`, `tabindex`, and a
key-rebinding review. The static counts were `role=` **0**, `tabindex` **0**, and exactly **one** `:focus`
rule in ~2,000 lines of stylesheet — which *removes* the outline.

**A static count says nothing about what a keyboard can do**, so it was measured live. A `<button>` is
focusable for free; a `<div>` with an `.onclick` never is:

```
in play       2 clickable,  2 reachable    0 unreachable
pause menu   15 clickable, 15 reachable    0 unreachable   <- already fine, and untouched
EDITOR       86 clickable, 59 reachable   27 UNREACHABLE (31%)
```

**The HUD and the pause menu needed nothing** — they are built from real `<button>` elements throughout.
The editor was the gap, and 19 of those 27 are DIVs carrying an `.onclick` that include the **entire mode
rail**: Build / World / Player / Enemies / Gameplay / Weapons / HUD / Save / Settings. **A keyboard user
could not change editor tab at all.** (The other 8 are `disabled` buttons — correctly unreachable, not a
defect, and the measurement says so rather than inflating the number.)

### One predicate, not 500 construction sites

There are ~500 `.onclick` assignments in this file and `renderEditorFields` tears the panel down and
rebuilds it constantly, so stamping attributes at each site would be a hand-kept list that drifts — the
defect recorded under builds 1152, 1266, 1320 and 1326. `_a11yWire(root)` asks the DOM a **question**
("clickable, and not already focusable?") and a `MutationObserver` re-asks it of anything added later, so a
control added by a future build inherits it.

**And it costs nothing until somebody uses a keyboard.** Build 1322 measured the panel rebuild at 8–27 ms
over ~3,000 nodes; an always-on observer walking all of that would be a real regression for the majority
who use a mouse. So the whole mechanism arms on the **first Tab press** — and `keydown` fires *before* the
browser performs its focus move, so the elements are in the tab order in time for the very keystroke that
armed them.

**`role="button"`, deliberately not a tablist.** A tablist owes the screen reader `aria-selected`,
`aria-controls` and arrow-key navigation, and a half-implemented one reads worse than an honest list of
buttons. The rail is a set of things you press; say that.

**Space is JUMP in this game**, so Enter/Space activation is gated on `role="button"` and an existing
handler, and returns immediately for native controls — double-firing a real `<button>`, or stealing Space
while the player is in the world, would each be worse than the bug being fixed.

### The focus ring, and why there wasn't one

The single pre-existing `:focus` rule is `outline: none` on text fields — the classic anti-pattern, someone
disliked the browser default and never drew a replacement. That rule is actually fine on its own terms (it
swaps in an accent border, so a focused *field* was always legible); every other control had nothing.

`:focus-visible`, not `:focus`, is what makes the replacement shippable: the browser matches it only for
keyboard focus, so clicking a button does not leave a ring stuck on it — which is exactly why outlines get
deleted in the first place. Verified live on the World tab: `matches(':focus-visible') true`,
`outline: solid 2px rgba(56, 245, 181, 0.95)`.

**Measured after, in the same live editor, after one real Tab keypress: 86 clickable, 78 reachable, 8
unreachable — and the 8 are exactly the disabled buttons.** A tab opened *after* arming inherits it (the
observer), and Enter on the focused World tab switched the editor mode.

Still open from the census: the key-rebinding review.

## The corner leak is one texel wide (build 1346)

Build 1345 halved the leak and the reporter said it looked unchanged. That is fair — 156 pixels of a bright
line is still a bright line — so this build characterises the residue instead of arguing with it.

**Where it is, on the reporter's own configuration** (a room with a doorway, their lighting): the bright
pixels sit on a wall's INNER face at `y = 2.99–3.00`, the wall/ceiling junction, facing the sun
(`N·L = 0.74`), with the occluder **one millimetre away**.

**The benign explanation is dead, and it was worth testing.** A sunlit top face seen edge-on aliases into
exactly a dashed bright line and would be *correct rendering* that no setting should change. The face
normals settle it: of eight bright pixels sampled, `upFaces 0, sideFaces 8`.

### It scales with exactly one thing

```
shadowDist   400     120      60      30      15       8
texel      39.06cm 11.72cm  5.86cm  2.93cm  1.46cm  0.78cm
leaking px    910     300     141      75      37      28
```

Proportional to the texel. Meanwhile `normalBias` is **flat across its whole range**, `shadowRadius` is flat,
and **overlapping the wall/ceiling seam by 3 / 6 / 12 cm changes nothing** (141/140/131 against a 130
baseline). So it is not a bias, not a filter width, and not a modelling seam that could be authored away:
**it is a band one texel wide along every concave corner**, which is the resolution limit of shadow mapping.

`texel = 2·extent / mapSize`. `shadowDist` is one half of that ratio — and it is a lever a creator already
has — but it shortens the range at which shadows exist at all. The MAP SIZE is the other half and costs only
time. Measured on the same room, with the return to 2048 as the control:

```
near map    2048        4096        8192      2048 (control)
leaking px    136          70          39       137
frame     323.6ms     364.3ms     528.3ms    330.6ms
```

**4096 halves the leak for ~12% of frame time; 8192 quarters it for 63%**, which is not a trade worth
making — recorded so it is not tried again. So the near cascade goes to 4096 on desktop.

Two exclusions, both deliberate:
- **The FAR cascade stays 2048.** Its texel is 4× coarser by design and a one-texel line on geometry tens of
  metres away is under a pixel. It was also exonerated directly: turning the near cascade off zeroed the
  leak, turning the far one off changed nothing.
- **Phones stay at 1024.** 12% of frame time is not free there and a 4096 depth map is ~16× the memory.

**A residue remains at ~70 px, and it is inherent.** An occluder 1 mm from its receiver is below what any
practical shadow map resolves. Closing it completely needs contact shadows — screen-space or traced — not a
bigger map. The comment says so at the constant.

`SUN_SHADOW_PX` is declared **immediately above its only use**, not beside `SHADOW_DEPTH_BIAS`: that constant
lives ~140 lines further down, so the tidy-looking placement would have been a temporal dead zone, and
`typeof` does not guard one (builds 1127, 1331). The test pins the ordering.

Two pins moved. `test-50`'s quoted the literal `IS_COARSE ? 1024 : 2048` pair; its intent — touch gets a
materially smaller map — is now *stronger* (a quarter, not a half) and it asserts the relation. And
**`test-1345`'s broke on a needle that stopped being unique**: this build added a second `A RESIDUE REMAINS`
note and `indexOf` found the new one first. That is the character-budget trap in another costume — a source
pin anchored on a phrase is only as stable as that phrase's uniqueness.

## The corner leak was the DEPTH bias, and build 1341 was innocent (build 1345)

Third report of *"light leaks in corners… I've noticed this with closed rooms too."* Build 1341 cut
`normalBias` from 0.45 m to 0.15 m for exactly this and the reporter still saw it. So this time the room was
BUILT IN THE ENGINE and the light decomposed, rather than a parameter reasoned about a third time.

**First, the general answer, which is not the reported one.** In a sealed 8×6×3 room with a ceiling and no
openings, at the reporter's own settings:

```
                        interior radiance Y     share
everything on                  0.0177
sun alone (all ambient off)    0.0012            6.8%
sky fill alone                 0.0120           68%
environment probe              0.0032           18%
one-bounce ambient             0.0019           11%
```
**93% of the light inside a sealed windowless room comes from terms no wall can block** — the hemisphere
fill, the probe and the bounce are all unoccluded, and the engine has no GI. That is a real property worth
knowing, and it is *not* a leak.

**The reported one is in the PEAK, not the mean.** With every ambient term zeroed, the sun still produces a
spike of 0.145 against a mean of 0.0012 — 120×, i.e. concentrated into a thin feature. Sun off gives a clean
zero. That is the bright corner line.

### What it is not, and what it is

Every row states BOTH cascades explicitly, because an earlier run set one value and left it set:

```
normalBias   0 / 0.05 / 0.10 / 0.15 / 0.45(pre-1341)  ->  353 / 358 / 365 / 359 / 357 leaking px   FLAT
map size     512 / 2048 / 4096                        ->  flat.    shadowRadius 0  ->  flat
far cascade off -> unchanged.    NEAR cascade off -> ZERO.    sun off -> ZERO

shadow.bias      0    -0.0001   -0.0004*   -0.0005   -0.002   -0.008   -0.03
leaking px      151     208       354        404      1500     7417    25986
peak radiance  0.087   0.106     0.144      0.152    0.156    0.156    0.156      (* = shipped)
```

**So build 1341's parameter is exonerated by measurement, and the culprit is the one beside it.** A depth
bias shifts the comparison depth by a CONSTANT, which is precisely what lets light past an occluder closer to
the receiver than the offset — and a concave corner is that case by definition. The leaking pixels sit ~1 cm
from the corner and the wall that should shadow them is **8 mm away**, an order of magnitude under the near
cascade's 5.86 cm texel. A normal offset moves the sample ALONG THE SURFACE and cannot do this, which is why
sweeping it across its whole range was flat.

Shipped: `SHADOW_DEPTH_BIAS = 0`, named once so the two cascades cannot drift (1341's lesson). Verified on the
shipped path afterwards: **354 → 156 leaking pixels, peak 0.144 → 0.085.**

**The acne measurement failed, and that is stated rather than dressed up.** A negative depth bias exists to
prevent acne. Speckle on open ground at sun elevations 8° / 20° / 45° was FLAT across bias 0 / −0.0001 /
−0.0004 / −0.002 — *and flat with `normalBias` also zeroed*, which is the tell that the instrument cannot
detect acne rather than that there is none. What the numbers do support: a more negative bias never REDUCED
speckle in any of twelve configurations while it measurably cost leak. Acne stays on the human-verify list, as
build 1341 also left it: a low sun on a large flat surface is the check.

**A residue remains — 151 pixels, not 0.** An occluder 8 mm from its receiver is below what a 5.86 cm texel
can resolve at all, so a thin corner line is inherent to shadow mapping at this scale. Closing it needs
contact-scale occlusion (SSAO, or the per-vertex bake — the reporter has both switched off), not more bias.
The comment says so, so nobody tunes this number chasing the last of it. A creator's placed spotlight is
deliberately left at its own `-0.0005`: the sweep ran on the sun's ORTHOGRAPHIC cascades and a perspective
shadow frustum has a different depth distribution, so the measurement does not transfer and I have not made it.

### Six instrument failures, and every one produced a confident number

This is the worst run of the session and all six are the same family — *I did not control the thing I was
measuring against*:

| # | it reported | why |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | a sealed room's light readings | camera at **y = 201.4**, not 1.4 — 200 m in the air, photographing open sky |
| 2 | the same readings after fixing that | the pose was set in one call and measured in the next, and **the frame loop rewrites `camera.position` from the player every frame**. Pose and render must be ONE block |
| 3 | the camera standing on the roof | the floor was found by casting DOWN from above, which hits the ceiling first |
| 4 | "every shadow parameter has no effect" | **`_fitSunShadow` rewrites `normalBias` every frame**, so each override was reset before the measurement. Same class as #2 |
| 5 | "normalBias 0 removes the leak entirely" — a clean, beautiful, **false** positive I nearly published | the preceding control row had set `moon.intensity = 0` and **left it there**. It was measuring a switched-off sun |
| 6 | "nothing occludes these points from the sun" | `_sunDir()` returns an **array** and already points TOWARD the sun; I read `.x/.y/.z` off it (NaN) *and* negated it. `NdotL: null` in the JSON was the tell — NaN serialises as null |

**#5 is the one to carry.** A control row that mutates shared state and does not restore it poisons every row
after it, and it fails in the most dangerous direction: it produced exactly the result I was hoping for. Every
row of a sweep must state **every** variable it depends on, not just the one being swept — which is what the
final probe does, and it immediately inverted #5's conclusion.

And the standing rule gets a corollary. Build 1124: *know where the camera is before you judge the frame.*
1345: **know who else writes what you are setting.** In this engine the frame loop owns the camera, the shadow
fit owns `normalBias`, and `applySky` owns `scene.environment` — an override that is not in the same
synchronous block as the render has already been undone.

Two pins moved (143, 1125), both correctly: 143's asserted a small negative depth bias, which is the defect;
it asserts the single named constant now. 1125's intent — that the depth bias is a flat constant rather than
something scaled with the volume — is untouched and now says so directly.

## The blur was interpolating a flag (build 1344)

Fourth round of the jagged-edges report, and **build 1343's readout found it in one line**:

```
AA MSAA x4   render 1.00/1.00   rung 0   +blur
```

MSAA *was* reaching their frame, at native resolution, at the top rung. So the ladder (1342), the render
scale, WebGL 1 and depth of field are all eliminated at once, and whatever hardens the edge happens **after
the MSAA resolve**, in the post chain, with motion blur the only variable. That is what an instrument buys:
1342 was a guess, 1343 was a question, and this is the answer to it.

`_matAfter` reads `_velRT` — a **half-res** buffer whose `rg` is a direction and whose `a` is a
written/not-written **flag** — at full-res uvs, and branches on `vv.a > 0.5`. Under `LinearFilter` a full-res
pixel centre lands exactly a quarter of a texel off a half-res texel centre, **for every pixel, everywhere**,
so bilinear returns a 0.75/0.25 mix of two texels and can never return a pure one. At a silhouette that hands
the threshold a flag of 0.75 on one pixel and 0.25 on its neighbour — and those two take **entirely different
directions**, because the rotation fallback knows nothing of camera translation or object motion.

Measured on the default level in real motion, rendering the blur's own direction field and reading it back,
with the same field minus the branch as the control:

```
                                   max jump between ADJACENT pixels   pixels affected   invented flag
control — no branch at all                     0.0 px                        0
LinearFilter (as shipped)                     15.3 px                      492               0.74%
mix() the two directions by the flag           6.6 px                      552
3x3 velocity DILATION                         35.1 px   <- the textbook fix, and WORSE
NEAREST (shipped here)                         1.6 px                       38               0.00%
```

**Fifteen pixels of sampling offset between two adjacent pixels**, quantised to 2 screen pixels along every
silhouette, after the resolve — which is exactly why 4x MSAA could not touch it and why it only appeared with
blur on, at any strength.

**Dilation being worse is the interesting result**, and it is not a bug in the experiment. Dilation is the
standard fix for a *different* defect — a moving object's blur being cut off at its own silhouette by the
static background — and it works by deliberately pushing a large velocity into pixels that had none. That is
the opposite of what a discontinuity metric wants. Right tool, wrong question; recorded so it is not tried
again.

The fix is one word: `_velRT` is built `NearestFilter`. **A direction field is not an image.** Interpolating
it invents a velocity belonging to neither surface, and interpolating a boolean invents a "partly written"
state that a threshold then resolves arbitrarily. It costs nothing — the snap is free in hardware — and
`_velRT.texture` is bound in exactly one place, which the test pins so the sampler change cannot reach
anything else. The `vv.a > 0.5` branch is deliberately **unchanged**: with NEAREST it reads a true 0 or 1, so
a threshold is finally the right shape for it, and `mix()`-ing the two directions measured 4x worse.

**A correction to build 1246, at the place it happened.** That build recorded the bilinear mixing and accepted
it: *"the residual softening is the half-res buffer's bilinear boundary mixing weapon and world velocity at the
silhouette — the standard gather-blur edge artifact, accepted."* It measured **softening** and never asked
whether the same blend made the direction field **discontinuous**, which hardens edges instead. The blend was
seen; the branch on top of it was not.

### Four instrument failures before a single number was real

Every one produced output, and only the controls stopped three of them being published:

| # | what it reported | why it was wrong |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 44.52% invented under Linear, 44.54% under Nearest | two filters cannot agree to two decimals. **No control.** The debug shader was never in the frame and this was an ordinary screenshot |
| 2 | control failed: a flat 0.5 red came back mean 83.8 | correct catch, wrong reason assumed — I blamed the shader swap |
| 3 | control failed again, after waiting on frames genuinely presented | `page.screenshot()` is not a faithful read of this canvas. **No amount of waiting fixes an instrument that is looking at the wrong thing** |
| 4 | `_velRT` reads 100% unwritten | half-float target read into a `Float32Array` — build 1152's lesson #6, verbatim, again |

**#3 is the one worth carrying.** The fix was to stop screenshotting entirely: render the question into a
`FloatType` target with the engine's own fullscreen quad and read it back with `readRenderTargetPixels`. No
compositor, no DOM, no PNG round trip. Every number in the table above comes from that path.

And #2/#3 only became findable because `post-passes.mjs` counted which passes actually run: under SwiftShader
with MSAA and the full chain, this scene renders **about one frame per second**, so a 700 ms wait was
photographing the previous frame. **A probe that waits in wall-clock time is measuring the renderer's speed,
not its output** — wait on frames.

Two pins moved (872, 1246), both with their assertions still true. 872's scoped the gap between two lines
with `{0,2000}` characters and broke when a comment landed between them — the character-budget trap, for the
fifth time this session; it asserts the ORDER now.

## The frame says what is antialiasing it (build 1343)

Third round of the jagged-edges report, and the reporter's reply to build 1342 is what this build is:

> *"No visual change with 1342. What's interesting is if I turn adaptive resolution off, there is no visual
> difference. Still jagged in both."*

**That one sentence kills every explanation that routes through the adaptive ladder**, including 1342's. With
the ladder off, `_prStepI` is 0, `_hiFxOn` is true and `_desiredPostSamples()` returns 4 — so if the picture is
identical either way, MSAA is not reaching that frame at all, and no rung, no strike-out and no shed effect can
be the reason.

I have now guessed twice (the velocity buffer, then the ladder) and been wrong twice, on a symptom I cannot
reproduce here. So this build does not guess a third time. It does what build 1274 established the last time a
report could not be reproduced: **ship the safe default, make the symptom structurally impossible where you
can, and make the subsystem able to ANSWER the question next time.** 1273/1274 were those steps for culling;
this is the third one for antialiasing.

`_aaState()` is the whole pipeline's answer in one object, and both readouts consume it — the perf HUD line
(the `` ` `` key) and four rows in Level Check. **One derivation, deliberately**, because a HUD and a panel that
disagreed about the frame would be worse than either alone, and this file records that defect seven times.

Five things decide whether an edge is antialiased, and only one of them is the ladder:

| | why it produces exactly this report |
|---|---|
| **WebGL 1** | `_desiredPostSamples()` returns 0 outright, at every rung, forever. No in-game setting can bring MSAA back — and turning the ladder off would change nothing, which is the reporter's observation verbatim |
| **Depth of field** | rasterises into its own single-sampled target, so the frame gets FXAA instead (build 1284). Independent of the ladder |
| **the rung** | 1342's story. Shown as a number so it is visible rather than inferred |
| **FXAA vs MSAA** | the fallback is measurably weaker — 1126 measured a 1.02-pixel coverage gradient on 100 of 100 scanlines become a hard edge on 94 of 99. *"AA is broken"* and *"AA is the weak one"* are different bugs |
| **the render scale** | `_prBase = min(devicePixelRatio, 1.5)`, which sits **underneath** all of it |

**That last row is the one I could not have found by reasoning, and it fits the report best.** On a
devicePixelRatio-2 display — every modern laptop — the world is drawn at **75% of native** and the browser
upscales it. Jagged edges that no antialiasing setting can touch, at full quality, with the ladder at rung 0,
*identical with adaptive resolution on or off*. The readout says so immediately: `render 1.50/2.00 (75% of
native)`.

Verified through the real pipeline in all four states (`tools/probe/aa-state.mjs`):

```
settled (SwiftShader)   AA FXAA only          render 0.66/1.00 (66% of native)  rung 3 fxOff
top rung forced         AA MSAA x4            render 1.00/1.00                  rung 0
+ depth of field        AA FXAA only (DoF)    render 1.00/1.00                  rung 0
post-processing off     AA canvas AA (post off)
a dpr-2 display                               render 1.50/2.00 (75% of native)
```

**Level Check reports only what is actually degraded** — a full-quality frame says nothing, because a panel
that always complains is not read. And the render-scale row distinguishes the adaptive scaler from the
engine's own ceiling, since the reporter had already ruled the scaler out and a message blaming it would have
wasted their time a third time.

**Motion blur is in the readout as a FACT about the frame, not as a cause.** Build 1342 measured it four ways
and blur makes a silhouette *softer* (65.7% → 72.2% of scanlines antialiased). It is there because the report
is about blur and *"turn it on and read the line again"* needs something to read.

### Two instrument faults, both mine, and one of them is the reason the DoF case looked broken

- **`dofEnabled = (worldCfg.dof === true)`, and my probe set `worldCfg.dof = 1`.** So the DoF row reported
  nothing and I spent a cycle believing `_aaState` had a bug it did not have. A truthy value is not `true`,
  and the identity comparison is the engine's, deliberately.
- **The first `_aaReport` re-derived every term `_aaState` already returned**, directly under a comment
  claiming one source of truth. It reads the state now, and `test-1343` asserts none of the terms appear
  twice — the check is cheap and the defect is this file's most repeated one.

**Stated plainly: this build fixes nothing.** It is an instrument. Whether the reporter's frame is WebGL1, a
high-DPI upscale or something still unnamed, the next message will contain the answer instead of a symptom.

## Motion blur was buying an effect with your antialiasing (build 1342)

Reported from play with a screenshot of the default level: *"seriously jagged edges… if any level of motion
blur is turned on (anything >0) those rough jagged edges appear."*

**Four probes failed to find blur damaging an edge, and that IS the finding.** At the forced top rung with
MSAA live, blur makes a silhouette *softer*:

```
postMotion 0 / 0.3 / 0.62   ->   65.7% / 70.4% / 72.2% of scanlines antialiased
```

and on the DEFAULT level, mid-motion, with and without the velocity buffer, the three conditions are
identical within noise (26.5% / 25.7% / 26.5% hard edges). **The blur is not drawing the jagged edge. It is
paying for it.**

`_desiredPostSamples()` returns 4 only at `_prStepI === 0 && _hiFxOn`, and the adaptive ladder's FIRST
relief was `_hiFxOn = false` — so the very first downshift throws MSAA away while keeping full resolution.
Motion blur is not free: at the top rung it adds a full-res blur pass **and a half-res velocity SCENE
RENDER** (build 1246). Measured, switching it on costs **~14% of frame time** (median 272.6 → 311.7 ms
under SwiftShader; the absolute numbers mean nothing there, the ratio does). On a machine sitting near the
ladder's threshold, 14% is exactly what tips rung 0 into rung 1 — and rung 1 has no MSAA at all.

**At any strength**, because the passes run regardless of the amount. Which is precisely what the report
said, and what no "does blur blur the edge" experiment could ever have explained.

### The ladder sheds in value order now

Motion blur becomes the cheapest rung, ABOVE the FX rung: a marginal machine keeps its edges and loses an
effect, instead of keeping the effect and losing its edges. Three things make it safe:

- **The gate requires blur to actually be on.** A level that never uses it must not spend a rung shedding
  nothing while the machine struggles. Written as `typeof _postMotion !== 'undefined' && …`, which also
  makes every existing ladder harness behave exactly as it did.
- **Recovery is the reverse.** Resolution, then the FX rung, then blur last — the least valuable thing back
  last.
- **A three-strike lock on the same pattern as `_hiFxFails`**, so a re-arm that immediately fails cannot
  become a limit cycle. Turning the scaler off restores everything, blur included, because "off" is a
  promise of full quality.

Executed against the real `_adaptResTick` by TRACING the sequence rather than reading the end state — the
ladder keeps shedding for as long as the machine stays slow, so a state read after a long run says nothing
about what went first.

### Five instrument failures, and the one that mattered

| # | what it said | why it was wrong |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | blur costs MSAA | ran on adaptive rung 3, where MSAA is off **in both conditions** |
| 2 | 21.472 jaggedness in both blur conditions | screenshot taken after the scripted spin stopped — blur was back at zero |
| 3 | 91% of edges hard even with MSAA on | looked for the intermediate pixel at x−1 and x+2, which are the PLATEAUS |
| 4 | edge jaggedness ~23 everywhere | re-searched for the strongest gradient per scanline, so it hopped between different edges of one box |
| 5 | `_prStepI` climbed to 60 | `JSON.stringify(extractConst(...))` made `_PR_STEPS` a STRING, whose `.length` is the character count |

Only #5 was caught by its own absurdity. **The lesson is #1's:** a probe that forces or ignores the adaptive
ladder cannot see a bug whose mechanism IS the adaptive ladder. Build 1242 lost a capture round to the same
thing and the note said so; I read it as being about a shed gate rather than about the rung.

Six pins moved (872, 880, 1126, 1141, 437, and 1141's rung count). Three of them quoted a whole line
verbatim and broke when it gained a term — the character-budget trap in miniature — and assert their members
now. One of my own repair comments contained a **backtick inside a template literal** and closed it, which
this file already records under build 1328.

## The shadow bias was wider than a wall (build 1341)

Reported from play with screenshots: light leaking along edges and inside **closed rooms**, and a column
whose shadow starts with a lit gap instead of at its base.

Both are one number. Measured live at the shipped defaults, before touching anything:

```
shadowDist 60, map 2048, extent 60  ->  texel 5.86 cm,  normalBias 0.4512  (7.7 texels)
the far cascade                     ->  normalBias 1.805
```

**Forty-five centimetres** of world-space offset along the receiver's normal — and the room tool's own
default wall is `roomDraft.t = 0.3`. The lookup was displaced **one and a half walls**, so it landed on the
lit side and the room was lit through its own wall. The same offset slides a contact shadow out from under
the thing casting it, which is the gap at the column's base. The far cascade's 1.805 m is **six walls**.

### The unit was the bug

Build 1125 got half of this right, and its correction was real: `normalBias` had been a world constant tuned
against the old fixed ±80 volume, build 1120 made the volume variable without retuning it, and 1125
re-expressed the constant in TEXELS so it would scale. But **the trade has two ends and they are measured
in different units**:

- **Acne** is a shadow-map SAMPLING artifact. Its scale is TEXELS.
- **Light leak and peter-panning** are GEOMETRY artifacts. Their scale is METRES, set by how thin the things
  a creator actually builds are.

A rule in texels alone cannot know that at shadowDist 60 it has grown past a wall. So the texel rule stays,
and a world cap sits beside it — **derived from the room tool's own default wall** rather than picked (half
of it, so the offset cannot reach a wall's mid-plane), with a **1.5-texel floor** so the cure cannot become
the disease: at shadowDist 400 a texel is 39 cm, and a flat 0.15 m cap would be 0.4 of a texel on the volume
where the map is coarsest.

```
dist    texel      normalBias   texels   far cascade
   8    0.78cm     0.060        7.7      0.150      <- unchanged: the texel rule still binds
  20    1.95cm     0.150        7.7      0.150      <- the crossover
  30    2.93cm     0.150        5.1      0.176
  60    5.86cm     0.150        2.6      0.352      <- the default: was 0.451 / 1.805
 120   11.72cm     0.176        1.5      0.703
 400   39.06cm     0.586        1.5      0.732      <- the texel floor takes over
```

It only ever LOWERS the bias, and never below the sampling scale. The near cascade, the far cascade and a
creator's spotlight now share **one** derivation instead of three literal caps (0.6, 2.2, 0.35) that had to
be kept in step — and the far one, at 1.8 m, had never been in step with anything.

**Build 1095's own tuning was already leaking.** 0.6 m was two of the engine's walls; there was simply no
volume small enough for anyone to notice until 1120 made shadowDist variable and 1125 held the ratio.

### What I did NOT measure, stated plainly

**That the residual gap at 0.15 is smaller than at 0.45.** Three attempts at that measurement produced junk
— a counter that saturated at its loop limit for every input, a leak reading that moved non-monotonically
because the rig was re-aiming the camera between samples, and a scanline that turned out to be crossing the
column's own lit edge rather than the ground. What IS established: the parameter, the geometry it exceeded,
and that the bias is what lights those pixels — a controlled A/B (auto-exposure and grain off, one camera,
one scene) took the base region from `57,56,54,52` at the shipped bias to `26,26,26,26` at zero.

**The acne floor is likewise unmeasured**, which is why the change is conservative in that direction: 2.6
texels at the default is inside the ordinary range for a normal offset, and small volumes are byte-identical.
Acne is on the "what only a human can verify" list — worth a look at a low sun on a large flat surface.

Five pins moved (1125, 1120, 1132, 1185, 1261). Four of them grabbed the derivation with a **two-line
regex** — the line-count form of the character-budget trap this file records — and take the whole block by
slice now. 1125's own numbers genuinely changed, since this constant is its entire subject; its intent
(one derivation, texel-proportional below the cap, small enough not to erase the shadow it biases) is
asserted in the regime it still governs, and that last assertion now passes by a much wider margin.

## Alpha cutout (build 1340 — rendering audit #4)

> Greped `alphaTest` across the game script: **one hit**, the snow sprite. Foliage cards, chain-link, grates
> and decals-as-props are unbuildable without either z-fighting or blend-sorting artifacts; opacity <1 forces
> `transparent`.

Verified. A creator had exactly one alpha tool and it was the wrong one. Alpha **blending sorts per object**,
so a bush drawn as one transparent card either draws in front of what is behind it or vanishes behind it,
and never intersects correctly. A cutout is **opaque**: it writes depth, sorts per PIXEL for free, and needs
no ordering at all.

### One writer of the blend state

Cutout and blend are mutually exclusive, and `_applyPropBlend` is the only function that touches
`transparent` / `opacity` / `depthWrite` / `alphaTest` / `side`. Two functions each setting those is the
defect this file has recorded **six times** — whichever ran last would win, so turning on a cutout and then
nudging opacity would silently un-cut the leaves. Executed both directions:

```
applyPropOpacity(0.4)   -> alphaTest 0    transparent true   opacity 0.4  front
applyPropCutout(0.5)    -> alphaTest 0.5  transparent false  opacity 1    double
applyPropOpacity(0.9)   -> alphaTest 0.5  transparent false  opacity 1    double   <- still cut out
applyPropCutout(0)      -> alphaTest 0    transparent true   opacity 0.9  front    <- the 0.9 came back
```

**Double-sided is not a preference.** A foliage card, a grate and a chain-link panel are all single quads,
and a single-sided quad is invisible from behind — a cutout that disappears when you walk round it is not a
feature anybody would keep.

**The cutoff clamps below 1** (`CUT_MAX = 0.99`): at exactly 1 every pixel fails the test and the prop
vanishes, which reads as "the engine ate my prop".

### The shadow follows the holes

Asserted against the **real r149** shadow path rather than assumed: `getDepthMaterial` takes its custom
branch for `(material.map && material.alphaTest > 0)` and copies `alphaTest`, `map` and the mapped `side`
into the depth material. So a leaf card casts a leaf-shaped shadow — and if an upgrade drops that, foliage
silently starts casting rectangles and nothing errors, which is why it is pinned.

### Measured

Same camera, same scanline, only the flag changed:

```
cutout 0     alphaTest 0    side front    scanline min 12 max 17   FLAT — one solid card
cutout 0.5   alphaTest 0.5  side double   scanline min 16 max 82   alternating across 31 runs
```

**The first two runs of that probe measured the middle of the frame and produced numbers opposite to the
prediction** — because the card was not on that scanline at all. It projects the card and raycasts it before
believing a pixel now. Build 1124's rule, and the third time this session that it has been the answer.

**The standing trade, restated:** build 1285's prepass excludes `alphaTest` materials, so a cutout
contributes no AO, SSR or velocity of its own. A missing occluder is a far smaller error than a solid
rectangle where a leaf is; the real fix is alpha-tested prepass variants, and that is its own build.

One pin moved (871), which executes `applyPropOpacity` in an isolated scope — the real blend writer is
supplied to it rather than stubbed, because every assertion there is about what that state ends up as, and
it gained three cases for the interaction.

## A slice can hold a single frame (build 1339)

Asked for from use: *"add an option to hold a single frame. The default slow bob of the weapon while idling
looks great, and works for most situations."*

A baked weapon idle is usually a breathing loop, and the engine **already** bobs the viewmodel — so mapping
one to `idle` gives you two idles at once, and only one of them is a number the creator can turn. A held
frame takes the baked motion out and leaves the bob.

**It is deliberately not a one-frame range, and that distinction is the whole build.** A range of `[n, n]`
still brackets `t0` and `t0 + 1/fps`, which are two *different* poses, so the clip creeps. Measured on a
source whose slide travels z 0→3 over three seconds:

```
                          key values         played on the real gun, 60 frames
one-frame RANGE [45,45]   z 1.500, 1.533     2 distinct poses  (it creeps)
HELD frame      [45]      z 1.500, 1.500     1 pose, 1.50000
```

A hold evaluates the pose **once** and writes it to both ends, so every interpolation between them returns
the same value. `test-1339` asserts the stronger property rather than key equality: sampled 21 times across
its own timeline through three's real interpolant, a held slice returns **one** value — it cannot drift
however the action is looped, timescaled or blended.

A hold is defined by its **in-point alone**. The out-point is ignored, and the reversed-range swap is
skipped for it — otherwise "hold frame 45" with a stale out of 10 would silently become "hold frame 10".

In the panel the Out field and *Set out* are **disabled rather than hidden** (a control that vanishes reads
as a bug, and unticking should give back the range you had), the readout reads `still · frame 45 of 90`,
Play parks the playhead on the held frame instead of looping nothing, and the list row shows it as a still.
The flag serializes only when set, and it is part of the apply signature — without that, ticking the box on
an existing slice would re-apply nothing.

Omitting the flag is byte-identical to the pre-1339 call, so every slice made before this build is unchanged.

## Placed lights join the budget (build 1338 — rendering audit #5)

> `registerEmitterLight` is called from emissive props and adopted GLB lights — **not** from `buildLight`.
> So the Lights tool, the thing a creator actually lights a level with, produces point/spot lights that are
> never distance-culled, never faded, and never touched by `enforceEmitterCap`.

Verified at the line. Build 811's budget had existed for 500 builds and the one surface that most needed it
was outside it.

**It is deliberately NOT fixed by calling `registerEmitterLight`, and that is the whole design.**
`updateLightBudget` WRITES `light.intensity` every frame — and a placed light already has an owner writing
that same value: `updateLights`, which ramps it between the signal on/off states. **Two writers of one value
is the defect this file has recorded five times**, and the second one wins, so registering would have turned
every signal-controlled lamp back on. The budget is a FACTOR the existing owner multiplies into its target,
so `off` stays off (0 × anything is 0), a fade still ramps, and there is still exactly one writer.

Measured live, 20 lights in a line receding from the camera at a cap of 8:

```
z            0   -4   -8  -12  -16  -20  -24  -28  -32  -36  -40  -44  -48 …
intensity    8    8    8    8    8    8    8    8  6.4  4.8  3.2  1.6    0 …   the 5-rank easing band
saved        8    8    8    8    8    8    8    8    8    8    8    8    8 …   authored, never faded
signal-off nearest 0.000 while its neighbour holds 8.000       <- one writer, not two
shadow-caster farthest 8.00 while its neighbour is 0.00        <- exempt
deploy cap  60 placed + 11 emitter, cap 48 -> 23 dropped, 37 live, 23 restored, 60 back in the editor
under budget: the rank map is null — no ranking, no lookup, no cost
```

**Shadow-casters are exempt from both the fade and the cap.** They are already bounded by
`_shadowLightBudget` (1132), they are the most deliberate light a creator can place, and fading one to
nothing *while it still renders a depth pass* is the worst of both.

**The deploy cap is the half that actually buys anything.** Build 1257's own finding is that a dimmed light
still costs its loop iteration — r149 compiles `NUM_POINT_LIGHTS` from every light PRESENT — so the fade is a
visual measure and REMOVING the surplus is the only lever that changes the loop. Placed lights therefore
share ONE budget with the emitter lights, and are dropped only after those are gone: an emissive prop's glow
is a side effect a creator got for free, a lamp they positioned by hand is a decision. **Every dropped light
comes back on the way into the editor** — the cap is a runtime budget, not an edit to their scene — and the
Level Check says how many went and that they are not lost.

### The latent bug this would have activated

`_lightOpts` serialized `+L.intensity` — the LIVE value. A `startOff` light sits at 0 at deploy, so saving
mid-play would already have written a creator's lamp down to nothing; it was safe **only because
`_lightsToFull` happens to run on the way back into the editor**. A distance fade turns that coincidence into
silent data loss on any level with more than a handful of lights. It saves `litI` now — the value the slider
writes and every fade restores to.

One pin moved (543), which executes `updateLights` in an isolated scope and needed the new dependency
supplied inert — every one of its assertions is about the on/off ramp and had to keep measuring exactly
that. It gained two cases driving the factor.

**A probe note worth keeping:** the first run read 7.36 on every faded light and looked like a broken budget.
A placed light's default `lfade` is **0.4 s**, so the ramp needs ~25 frames to settle and the probe had
ticked two. *A fade measured before it finishes is not a measurement.*

## The slicer, per weapon (build 1337)

Asked for immediately after 1336: *"I really need it in the weapon tab for each weapon."*

**The button was the easy half.** A weapon does not animate on the character — the viewmodel gun carries its
own `AnimationMixer` and its own three-slot mapping (`idle` / `shoot` / `reload`, or the fists' punch R /
punch L / grab), built by `playGunStates`. Slicing a gun against the character rig would have shown the
player standing still while the numbers changed, which is exactly the *"you cannot see what you are
cutting"* the panel exists to remove.

So the rig is **resolved per kind** rather than found by looking around, and the two kinds are handed back
differently:

- **A character** returns to its state machine (`setEnemyAnimState(obj, 'idle', true)`).
- **A weapon is REBUILT.** A gun's actions are constructed *once* out of the clip list, so a new slice is
  not playable until they are built again — the rebuild is not tidying up, it is what makes the slice work.
  The weapon branch returns before the character branch, so a gun can never fall through to it.

**A gun whose clips name-matched nothing has no mixer at all.** The panel makes one for the scrub and takes
it back out of `mixers` on close — but only if it was the one that made it, or closing would strip a mixer
the engine owns.

**An edit has to reach `_gunClipNames`, and that is not obvious.** It is a separate list, populated at model
load, and it is what the weapon tab's dropdowns read — without refreshing it the slice would exist, be
playable, and be *unselectable*. Every weapon pointing at that model is refreshed, because several can share
one, and the panel redraws because the weapon tab builds its dropdowns in `renderEditorFields` rather than
refreshing them in place.

Measured live in the real editor, a synthesized 3s take whose slide travels z 0→3, loaded through the
engine's own `showWeaponModel`:

```
editor          editorActive "gun", _vmWanted() true, the button rendered
rig             { kind:"weapon", wep:"rifle", obj: THE VIEWMODEL GUN, madeMixer:false }
scrub           t 0/1/2/3  ->  the GUN's slide at z 0/1/2/3
after Add       clips ["allanim","Reload"], _gunClipNames.rifle ["allanim","Reload"], serialized
map to reload   gunStates ["reload"], playing clip "Reload", duration 1.0000
after close     panel gone, rig null, gunStates rebuilt, the gun's mixer still live
```

**A probe-instrument note, because it looked like a defect for ten minutes:** the button's tooltip read back
as `""`. The editor has its own tooltip system that moves every `title` to `data-tip` and removes the native
attribute. Nothing was wrong — the probe was reading the attribute the engine had deliberately just removed.

One pin moved (1336's release assertion, to its new address — same intent).

## One long take, sliced into clips (build 1336)

Asked for from use: *"most glb files I find have all animations (idle, shoot, reload) baked into one long
continuous animation."* This engine maps a SLOT to a **clip name**, so such a model could only ever have one
animation. The art fix is an NLA strip per action in Blender — a whole tool and a whole skill away from
someone building a level.

**A slice is just another named clip, and that is the entire reason this is small.** Every consumer already
resolves by name out of `gltf.animations` — `_resolveStateClip`, the per-weapon variants (1294), the
`clip:<name>` direct play (1079), the slot dropdowns, the peer replay. The slices are injected INTO that
array, so **not one of them changed** and a slice is reachable everywhere a real clip is.

### `AnimationUtils.subclip` is deliberately not used

three ships it, and both of its failure modes are silent. Executed against the real r149 build on a take
keyed at t=0 and t=5 plus a bone keyed only at t=0:

```
                      tracks   duration   single-key bone
AnimationUtils.subclip      0      0.000   DROPPED
sliceClip                   2      2.000   kept
```

- **A track with no key in range is dropped entirely** (`if(times.length===0) continue`). That bone then
  keeps whatever pose the *previous* animation left it in — which reads as "the model is broken", not "the
  slice is wrong". On the sparse take above it drops *everything* and the slice is empty.
- **The shift is by the first surviving key, and the end is trimmed to the last.** Even on a densely-keyed
  track, a 2-second request came back with `duration` **1**: a sliced reload that ends early.

**Bracketing fixes all three at once.** Every track is EVALUATED at exactly the in and out points and those
keys inserted, so no track can be empty, `t=0` is exactly the in-point, and the duration is exactly what was
asked for. `createInterpolant()` does the evaluating, which means a quaternion track is **slerped** — three's
own interpolant rather than a second opinion about rotation.

Ranges are **inclusive**, because that is what an animator means by "idle is 0 to 60" and because two
adjacent slices sharing their boundary frame is correct: the end pose of one IS the start pose of the next,
which is what makes a cut loop cleanly.

### The panel is anchored to the bottom, not centred

Every other modal in this file is centred. **A slicer you cannot see the model through is a pair of number
fields** — so this one sits along the bottom edge and scrubbing poses the live preview rig. The scrub sets
`paused`, writes an explicit `time` and calls `mixer.update(0)`, which evaluates the pose without advancing:
exact, rather than racing the frame loop. Measured: t 0 / 1.25 / 2.5 / 5 posed the rig at x 0 / 1.25 / 2.5 / 5.

Closing hands the rig back to the state machine, or it stands frozen on the last scrubbed pose.

### Where the slices live

**Keyed by MODEL URL, not by role.** The same character used by the player and by an enemy must slice the
same way, so they cannot live in a character config. They ride the level, sanitized on the way in *and* on
the way out, so nothing out-of-range can enter a share code.

`applyAnimCuts` is idempotent by signature and **removes its own previous work first** — otherwise editing a
slice would stack a second clip beside it with the same name and `find(by name)` would return whichever came
first. A slice may never take the name of a real clip, and the panel refuses that with a reason rather than
letting it be silently dropped one layer down.

Measured live: three applies in a row left `["allanim","Idle","Reload"]` unchanged; editing an out-point
updated in place; Add produced a working clip that appeared in the dropdowns and serialized; a colliding
name left the count at 3.

### The ordering bug I shipped into my own build and caught before pushing

`loadHostedProps()` is called bare at module level and builds the saved level's props **at boot** (1331), and
every model it loads is sliced on delivery. I had seeded `animCuts` beside the other level fields ~3,000
lines below that call — so the first level of a session would load against an EMPTY cut set and the slices
would only appear on the next level change. It is seeded at its declaration now, above the loader, and
`test-1336` pins `savedLevel < animCuts < loadHostedProps`. **Build 1331's lesson, applied prospectively:
anything the boot loader can consume must be declared above it.**

## A level says who it will make you talk to (build 1335 — platform audit 2.5)

> A level can direct the browser to fetch arbitrary `http(s)` URLs through prop `src`, every
> weapon/enemy/player/chest/coin/turret/grenade/attachment model url, per-primitive textures,
> `audioZones[].url`, custom SFX, the HDRI sky, `lobbyBg`, homepage `bg`/`logo` and HUD widget `img`.
> There is **no host allowlist, no confirmation prompt and no disclosure.** Opening a shared level link
> hands the player's IP to whoever authored it. For a product marketed to children this is the sharpest
> privacy edge in the whole system, and it is invisible.

**The url fields are deliberately NOT enumerated.** A hand-kept list that drifts from the thing it
describes is the single most-repeated defect in this file — the shape lists (1320), the zone-add list
(1320), the zone pick/drag lists (1326), the pickup transform (1327), the prop-entry apply (1280) — and a
privacy disclosure that silently misses a field is **worse than none, because it reads as complete.** So
the serialized level is WALKED: every string is examined, which covers every field that exists and every
field anybody adds later. `test-1335` proves that by feeding the walk a field invented after this build.

### The block is one declaration, not eleven guards

Blocking in JavaScript would mean a guard at eight loaders plus three CSS paths — and **the one that got
missed would be the one that leaked.** A CSP is ONE declaration the *browser* enforces across every fetch a
page can make, including CSS backgrounds and `new Image()`, so there is nothing to miss and nothing to keep
in step. It runs as the first script in `<head>`, because a policy only governs content parsed after it —
which is also why the setting needs a reload, and why the panel distinguishes **what is stored** from
**what is in force**. *A privacy control that claims protection it does not have is the worst possible
failure*, so `tpBlocked()` and `tpBlockLive()` are two questions.

The allowlist is the engine's own infrastructure, named: the script CDNs, the fonts, the founder's host,
and the PeerJS broker — without which multiplayer cannot signal.

### The control pair is the whole verification

```
                   block OFF                          block ON
policy live        false                              true
game               gameOn, 59 props                   gameOn, 59 props
same-origin fetch  ok 200                             ok 200
off-origin img     failed                             failed
CSP refusals       []                                 ["connect-src <- …", "img-src <- …"]
```

This sandbox has **no route to the open internet**, so "the image failed" is worth nothing — a network
failure and a refusal look identical, and the `off-origin img` row is the same in both. What discriminates
is `securitypolicyviolation`, which fires only from CSP and fires in exactly one of the two runs. The
same-origin row is the other half: **a block that also broke the engine would look like a success from the
refusal count alone.**

### And a finding nobody was looking for

**The shipped stock level already contacts two other sites** — `static.poly.pizza` and
`jarredksmith.github.io`. The first level anybody opens hands two third parties their IP. That is now
visible in the Level Check rather than being a fact only a network tab could tell you.

Both audiences are told: the creator through Level Check (they are the only person who can change it and
the only one who could not see it, and the row names the fix — upload the files to your own game), and the
player through a toast on a level that arrived from OUTSIDE, which is exactly the case they cannot inspect.
The modal reads the CURRENT level rather than a stored summary — a share link can swap the level at any
moment and **a stale list is a false statement** — and every host goes in as `textContent`, because a
hostname is level data (1325).

**Still open, and stated rather than implied:** the block is all-or-nothing. A per-host allowlist ("allow
poly.pizza, refuse the rest") is the better product and needs a UI for managing it plus a decision about
what a refused prop looks like in play; the report route and the privacy policy the audit lists as release
blockers are unaffected by this build.

## Colour vision (build 1334 — the last census entry)

**Correction, not simulation.** A simulation shows a colour-blind player what they already see.
Daltonization: RGB → LMS → drop the missing cone → back to RGB → take the ERROR the eye cannot carry →
redistribute it onto the channels it can. **Every one of those steps is linear, so the whole thing collapses
to ONE 3×3** — which is why this is an `feColorMatrix` and not a shader chain.

**It is a CSS/SVG filter on `<body>`, not a term in the composite pass, and that is the load-bearing
decision.** The composite is only one of three passes that can present a frame (DoF vertical, composite,
afterimage copy) and it is **absent entirely when post-processing is off** — which is exactly the low-end
device most likely to need this. One filter covers the 3D frame, the HUD, the menus and every render path,
present or future, instead of three shaders that have to be kept in step. Measured: `#hud` and the minimap
sit at identical rects with the filter on, so making `<body>` the containing block for fixed descendants
costs nothing here.

Measured on **real composited pixels** (screenshot, decoded through an offscreen canvas — a filter is
applied by the compositor and nothing inside the page can read it):

```
             filter              red             green         grey            teal
off          (none)              [255,0,0]       [0,192,0]     [128,128,128]   [56,245,181]
protan       url("#cbFilter")    [255,130,157]   [0,94,0]      [128,128,128]   [56,149,64]
deutan       url("#cbFilter")    [255,52,132]    [0,153,0]     [128,128,128]   [56,207,83]
tritan       url("#cbFilter")    [255,0,255]     [0,219,0]     [128,128,128]   [56,255,0]
protan @50%  url("#cbFilter")    [255,65,79]     [0,143,0]     [128,128,128]   [56,197,123]
off          (none)              byte-identical to the first row
```

**Two rows of that table are the verification, and the second one is the reason the control set has colours
in it at all:**

- **Grey did not move** — a 0,0,0 delta under every correction and at half strength. A dichromat sees a
  neutral grey as neutral, so the error term is zero there and every row of the matrix sums to exactly 1.
  `test-1334` recomputes all three from the constants and asserts that, rather than restating nine numbers.
- **Red landed on exactly the sRGB-space arithmetic**: protan gives G = 0.5089 → 129.8 → **130 measured**,
  B = 0.6173 → 157.4 → **157 measured**. That is what proves `color-interpolation-filters="sRGB"` took —
  an SVG filter defaults to **linearRGB**, where those two numbers are different. **The grey invariant
  could not have caught it, because grey is invariant in either space.** An invariant that holds under the
  bug is not a test for the bug.

`test-1334` also checks that `CB_L2R` really is the inverse of `CB_R2L` — every matrix derived from them is
quietly wrong otherwise — with a 1e-4 tolerance, because the published pair is rounded to nine digits and
the round trip is exact only to ~5e-5. That is 0.013 of one 8-bit code value, which is why the probe read a
clean zero.

`off` **removes** the filter rather than leaving an identity matrix in place: it is a full-screen composite
every frame and nobody should pay for a correction they are not using. Strength lerps toward identity, so 0
is exactly no correction and half is exactly half. Tritan's B-from-R coefficient is 3.37 and clips hard at
full strength — which is what the strength dial is for.

**The platform audit's accessibility census is now three-for-six**: UI scale, photosensitivity warning and
colour-blind modes are closed; `role=`, `tabindex` and a key-rebinding review remain.

## The interface has a size, and the game says what it contains (build 1333 — platform audit 9)

The accessibility census, verbatim: *`aria-label` 47, `role="` **0**, `tabindex` **0**, colour-blind modes
**0**, UI/font scale **0**, photosensitivity/epilepsy warning **0**.* Two of those close here; re-verified
open first — the only `photosens|epilep` hits in the file were prose about z-fighting.

### Interface size

Every size in the stylesheet is in px, so there was no single value a player could turn. **`zoom` is the
only property that scales LAYOUT AND HIT-TESTING together** — a `transform` moves the pixels and leaves
every click where it was, which is worse than no setting at all.

`#hud` is `position:fixed; inset:0`, so zooming it alone makes its BOX `100vw*S` and walks every
corner-anchored panel off screen. Dividing its own size by the same factor is what keeps the zoomed box
exactly one viewport: layout `100vw/S`, rendered `100vw/S × S`. Measured at 640×360:

```
                 x1                x0.75             x1.75             back to x1
hud box          [0,0,640,360]     [0,0,640,360]     [0,0,640,360]     [0,0,640,360]
ammo panel            167.4 px          126.0 px          291.4 px          167.4 px
render canvas    [0,0,640,360]     unchanged         unchanged         unchanged
#tStick          [26,202,132,132]  identical         identical         identical
crosshair offset [0,0]             [0,0]             [0,0]             [0,0]
```

**The on-screen touch controls are deliberately EXEMPT**, counter-zoomed back to 1. They already have their
own layout editor where a player sizes and places each control by thumb-reach, and silently rescaling that
is a different setting wearing this one's name. The counter-zoom works because effective scale multiplies
down the tree (`S × 1/S = 1`) and viewport units are not affected by an ancestor zoom.

Cards scale, backdrops do not — a backdrop is a full-viewport wash with nothing to read.

**It is NOT in the `a11y` blob**, even though its row sits in that fold: `loadA11y` clamps every one of
those keys to 0..1, which is exactly right for a multiplier of an effect and exactly wrong for a scale that
has to reach 1.75. Squeezing it in would have meant a special case inside a loop whose entire point is that
it has none. The fold's own *Restore defaults* still covers it, because that is what the button says.

**Instrument note:** `getComputedStyle(el).fontSize` reads **16px at every scale** — Chrome returns the
pre-zoom used value. The rendered size is what changed, and only a measured WIDTH shows it. A font-size
readout would have reported this feature doing nothing.

### The photosensitivity warning

Shown once per browser **at boot**, not at the first Play. That is the console convention and it is also
the only hook that needs no path analysis: `startGame` is reached from the menu, a share link, the community
gallery, a campaign step and the editor's own test run, and **a warning five callers have to remember is a
warning one of them will forget.**

It offers the fix rather than only the fact — *Reduce flashing* drives build 1313's own `a11yReduceAll`,
so the notice is an action and not a disclaimer. Measured live: `{1,1,1,1,1} → {shake 0, flash 0.35, blur 0,
sway 0, hitstop 0}`, both exits store the acknowledgement, a returning browser gets nothing at all, and the
pause fold forces it back up on demand. A player whose OS already asks for reduced motion is told that it
has been honoured rather than asked to say it again.

**The boot call sits immediately after the `const` it reads**, because `typeof` does not guard a temporal
dead zone (1127) and build 1331 is the same lesson from the other direction.

**`driver.mjs` now pre-acknowledges it.** A fresh Playwright context is always a fresh browser, so without
that every future probe and every capture would photograph the dialog instead of the game; `firstRun:true`
is how the dialog itself gets measured.

One pin moved (335) — a whole-literal match on the `:root` block, broken by one added variable with every
part of the assertion still true. It asserts the MEMBERS now, which is what *"defines the themable
variables"* always meant. **That is the character-budget trap in its other form: a pin that quotes a whole
literal is a pin against the literal, not against what it says.**

## The renderer arrived unverified (build 1332 — platform audit 2.6)

`grep -c "integrity=" breach.html` returned **0**. three.js IS the renderer and PeerJS IS the multiplayer
transport, both loaded from public CDNs into a page holding the publish key, the Sketchfab token and every
level save — so anyone who could alter what a mirror served owned every session. Rapier and fflate were
already vendored locally, so the pattern was understood; these two were simply the ones that never got it.

**The FALLBACK LIST is what makes SRI safe to add here rather than risky**, and that is the whole reason
this is a small change. A single hashed CDN turns "this mirror is serving altered bytes" into "the game
does not load". With three, a refused script fires `onerror` and the next mirror is tried — the exact path
the loader already takes for an unreachable CDN. All six URLs were fetched and hashed and each trio is
**byte-identical**, including `tests/node_modules/three@0.149.0`, which is what lets one hash cover a chain.

`crossOrigin='anonymous'` is not decoration: without it the response is opaque and the browser **cannot**
verify it, so the attribute sits there silently inert.

### Two controls, and the first build was theatre without them

"It booted" proves the hash is not wrong. It does **not** prove the browser checked it — an ignored
attribute boots identically. "Zero CSP violations" reads the same whether the policy is clean or absent.
Both needed provoking (`tools/probe/sri-csp.mjs`):

```
                              THREE   game                    CSP violations   base-uri control
shipped bytes                 r149    gameOn, 59 props, running      0         FIRED, baseURI not hijacked
ONE FLIPPED BYTE              ABSENT  --                             0         FIRED
```

**The positive control caught a real defect: my CSP `<meta>` was inside `<body>` and therefore IGNORED.**
A CSP meta found after content has been parsed does not apply, so the first version of this build shipped a
policy that did nothing while reporting a clean zero. It is now the first element in `<head>`, ahead of the
analytics tag, and `test-1332` asserts `<head> < meta < first <script> < <body>` — because the ordering *is*
the feature.

### What the policy is, and what it deliberately is not

`base-uri 'self'` (an injected `<base>` silently repoints EVERY relative URL — the saves, the gallery, the
uploads — at another origin), `object-src 'none'`, `form-action 'none'`, `frame-ancestors 'self'`
(clickjacking, against a game that takes pointer lock).

**No `script-src`, and the test pins that it must never arrive as an `'unsafe-inline'` one.** The engine is
~47,000 lines of INLINE script, so the only policy it could satisfy today is the one that protects nothing
while reading as protection. Vendoring three.js and PeerJS locally is the change that makes a real
`script-src` possible; that is its own build, and SRI is what covers those two meanwhile.

### What is still unhashed, named rather than left to be discovered

- **The ESM dependencies** — Rapier, gltf-transform, meshoptimizer, DRACOLoader, KTX2Loader — arrive through
  `import` / `import()`, and an ESM import **cannot carry `integrity` at all**. Import maps are the only way
  to hash an ESM graph and cannot be added without moving those loads out of dynamic `import()`. Smaller
  blast radius (on demand, into a page already running), not zero.
- **`gtag.js` is MUTABLE BY DESIGN.** Google reserves the right to change those bytes, so pinning a hash
  takes the page down the day they ship a fix. Removing it is a product decision, not an engineering one.

The comment in the source names all three, so the next audit finds a decision instead of a gap.

## A level with one emitter would not load (build 1331)

Reported from play, **with the stack build 1330 exists to produce**:

```
ERROR: Promise: Cannot access 'FX_PRESETS' before initialization
  at buildFxEmitter   (breach.html:21506)
  at Object.fx_dust   (breach.html:13982)     <- PRIMITIVE_BUILDERS.fx_dust
  at spawnProp        (breach.html:17947)
  at loadHostedProps  (breach.html:18027)
```

`loadHostedProps()` is called **bare at module level** and builds the saved level's props during boot;
`FX_PRESETS` was declared ~3,400 lines below it. So a saved level containing a single ambient emitter threw
partway through its own load. Everything lives inside `window.GAME_START`, which is why the throw surfaced
as an unhandled **rejection** — and therefore carried no line number of its own until 1330 kept the stack.

**Build 889 recorded this exact class, four lines above where the fix went in**: *"A saved level with track
pieces builds them at boot (loadHostedProps) BEFORE worldCfg initializes, which crashed the whole boot."*
It patched that with a `try/catch`, which was right *there* — the track style re-applies moments later, so
missing it is harmless. It is **wrong here**: an emitter with no preset is a thrown exception mid-load, and
swallowing it strands every later prop with nothing said. `FX_PRESETS` is pure data reading no other binding
(the test asserts that), so it simply moves above `PRIMITIVE_BUILDERS`.

**The rule left behind:** anything a `PRIMITIVE_BUILDERS` entry reads must be declared **above that table**,
because `loadHostedProps` can call any builder before most of the file has run. `test-1331` pins the order —
`FX_PRESETS` → the builder table → `spawnProp` → `loadHostedProps` → the module-level call.

### Two instrument failures, and one honest gap

- **I read a grep's context as the line itself.** My context printer showed the 130 characters *preceding*
  each hit, so the bare `loadHostedProps();` call rendered as the previous line's comment text and I
  concluded, twice, that the function was never called. The call was there the whole time. Print the line,
  not its neighbourhood.
- **I could not make the failure fire locally.** A seeded save containing `fx_dust` loaded clean on the
  pre-fix build. The diagnosis does not depend on that — the stack names the four frames, and the control
  file's `buildFxEmitter` sits at line 21505 against the reported 21506, so it is the same build — but the
  fix is verified **structurally** (the ordering) rather than by a reproduction, and that is worth saying
  plainly rather than implying a repro I never got.

**Two tests broke because they extracted by POSITION.** `test-1250` and `test-1252` both sliced "from
`const FX_PRESETS` to «some later function»", which after the move spanned ~7,500 unrelated lines and
swallowed `PRIMITIVE_BUILDERS`. They cut the table itself now. A position-relative extraction is precisely
what a move breaks, and moves are how TDZ bugs get fixed.

## The error overlay reports WHERE (build 1330)

A report from play arrived as a red bar reading **`ERROR: Promise: Cannot access 'FX_PRESETS' before
initialization`** and nothing else. In a 47,000-line single file, a message alone narrows it to nothing —
and I could not reproduce it: `FX_PRESETS` initialises fine here, every path that reaches `buildFxEmitter`
(direct spawn, the Object panel's Effects row, the + menu's Effect submenu, serialize→restoreLevel) runs
clean, and the literal is pure data so its initialiser cannot throw. A TDZ on a `const` that far down means
execution reached an access **before** its declaration line ran, which is a question about *when*, and the
overlay was throwing away the only thing that could answer it.

**The rejected-promise route was where the stack was destroyed, and that is the case with no line number of
its own.** The old handler rebuilt a bare `ErrorEvent` from `reason.message` alone:

```js
window.dispatchEvent(new ErrorEvent('error',{message:'Promise: '+(e.reason&&e.reason.message||e.reason)}));
```

So the hardest failure to place was the one stripped hardest. Three changes, each answering a real obstacle:

- **The stack survives both routes** — `e.error.stack` for a throw, `reason.stack` carried across the
  re-dispatch for a rejection. First six frames; past that it is the frame loop calling itself.
- **The FIRST error is kept, not the last.** A failure inside the frame loop repeats at 60 Hz and overwrote
  the original before anyone could read it. Later ones are counted: *"(+41 more errors since — the FIRST one
  is shown, it is usually the cause)"*.
- **It is selectable and scrolls**, because the whole point of the box is that it gets sent to someone.

Verified in a real browser: a throw shows `at inner / at outer / at eval`; a rejection shows the async
function it came from; 41 subsequent errors leave the first on screen with a count.

Build 659's ResizeObserver exemption and build 838's `let box = null` are both intact — 838's own pin moved,
because it scoped the declaration and the handler with a `{0,200}` window and this build put 2 kB between
them. **The assertion was still true.** That is the character-count trap this file records under build 1149,
for the fourth time; it asserts the ORDER now, which is what "declared before use" actually means.

## The last unbounded client claim (build 1329 — multiplayer audit 2.2)

**Re-verified before touching anything**, because most of the multiplayer CRITICALs turned out to be closed
already and re-fixing them would have been busywork:

| finding | state |
|---|---|
| 2.1 — the relay mediates one of 36 host-authoritative types | **CLOSED by 1279.** `_RELAY_OK` is an explicit four-type allow-list, so `hurt`, `wact`, `teams`, `duelOver`, `credit` and targeted `chat` impersonation are dropped, not forwarded |
| 2.2 — `died` | **CLOSED by 1279** — `_diedOk(id)` rate-limits it |
| 2.2 — `raceFin` | **CLOSED by 1279** — checked against the lap the host was already counting |
| 2.2 — `buyChest` | **OPEN** |

`buyChest` removed **any** crate for **everyone** with no proximity check, no rate limit and no validation of
any kind — a loop over the id range wiped every crate in the level for every player.

Bounded now by exactly what makes the claim possible, which is builds 1130/1164's own rule. A legitimate buy
needs the shop open, and the shop only opens inside **3.5 m** — so the host, which already holds every
client's position, checks that. `CHEST_REACH` is 8 rather than 3.5 because the packet arrives a round trip
after the player was standing there, and the reported position is itself already bounded by 1164's
`_plausibleMove`. A leaky bucket covers what proximity cannot: one crate per client per 400 ms.

**The test found a latent bug in my own fix.** `const last = _buyChestAt[id] || -1e9` — **a stored timestamp
of 0 is falsy**, so the first entry read back as "never" and the bucket never engaged. `performance.now()`
is never exactly 0 in a live page, so this would have sat there indefinitely without ever biting; only a
test that drives its clock **from zero** finds it. It is `(id in _buyChestAt)` now. Worth generalising:
**a `||` default on a numeric timestamp or counter is a bug waiting for the value to be 0.**

## The board shows the level's prop signals (build 1328)

Reported: *"If signals are created for a prop in the editor panel, make it show as nodes in the signal node
modal."*

**Two authoring systems that had never met.** A SIGNAL is `{when, do, target}` on a prop — the simple path,
and the one most levels are actually wired with. The GRAPH is nodes and wires. Open the graph on a level
built entirely out of signals and it said *"no nodes yet"*, which is flatly false: the level is full of
logic, just not in that data structure.

**They are a VIEW, and the distinction is load-bearing.** They are not in `logicGraph.nodes` — not
serialized, not sanitized, not pulsed, not wired — and they are drawn `[data-signode]`, never `[data-node]`,
which is what keeps build 1318's trace painter and the wire renderer from ever seeing them. Converting
signals into real graph nodes would **change what the level does**: the two systems fire at different times
through different code, so a conversion would silently rewrite every level that so much as opened the board.

Clicking a card does the only honest thing: closes the board, selects the prop that owns the signal, and
frames it. **A card that looked editable there and was not would be worse than nothing**, so the card says
*"prop signal — click to edit on the prop"* on its face.

Three details: the column sits 250 px left of the leftmost real node (and at a fixed origin when the graph
is empty, rather than at −Infinity); cards are capped at 60, because past that the view is a wall; and every
field is `textContent` per build 1325, since a prop name and a target tag are level data.

Measured live (`tools/probe/signal-mirror.mjs`), three props carrying five signals:

```
graph nodes 0, signals 5   ->  5 cards, each reading its own when / prop / verb / target
still a view               logicGraph.nodes 0, serialized 0, [data-node] 0, trace painter blind
column x 150 vs leftmost real node 400, stacked 20 / 92 / 164 / 236 / 308
click                      board closed, "vault door" selected, mode build / target props
0 signals -> 0 cards;  400 signals on one prop -> 60
```

**Two probe faults, both mine.** The empty-case check deleted signals from `propModels.slice(0,3)` — the
STOCK level's first three props, which never had any — and reported "still 5 cards" as if the removal had
failed. And a backtick inside a comment I added *inside a template literal* closed the template: a syntax
error in the instrument, not the engine. Neither reached a conclusion, but the first would have if the
number had been less obviously wrong.

## A joiner's pickups flashed (build 1327)

Reported from play: *"in a multiplayer match, the joiner sees the pickups, but they flash. They don't flash
on the host."*

**Flashing that is per-frame and camera-dependent is z-fighting** — two surfaces contending for the same
pixels. So the question was never "what toggles `visible`"; it was **what stands somewhere different on a
client**. Enumerating the scene answered it in one run.

The pickup snapshot carried `x, z, kind, ready` and **nothing else**. A pickup spot also carries an authored
`y`, three rotations and a scale (`pickupSpots {x,z,kind,item,y,rx,ry,rz,scale,interact}`), and the host
lifts every pad onto the ground with `_maxTerrainOver`. The client did neither — `m.position.set(pu.p[0], 0,
pu.p[1])`, flat at zero. A pad disc buried in, or exactly coplanar with, the floor **is** the flash.

```
ground 3, pad authored y 1.5 / ry 45 / scale 1.4
before   host group y 3            client group y 0     (rotation and scale lost entirely)
after    host y 4.5 ry 0.785 sc 1.4  ==  client y 4.5 ry 0.785 sc 1.4
```

The payload gained the three fields, **each omitted at its default**, so an unauthored pad is byte-identical
on the wire — and PU is only sent when the set changes, so the cost is nil. The client places its pads with
`_applyPickupXform`, **the host's own function**, rather than a second copy of the maths: that is the whole
reason the two diverged, and sharing the function is what stops it recurring.

**The same probe found a second thing nobody had reported.** `updatePowerups` opens with
`if(!powerups.length) return;` — and a client's pads live in `NET.powerupMeshes`, not in `powerups`. So a
joiner's pickups were never animated at all: no spin, no bob, and `pad.visible` never followed the world's
`pickupBase` toggle. Measured on a client: icon y 1.25 and rotation 0, unchanged after a frame. **A joiner
watched four dead discs and nobody said so**, presumably because the flashing was louder.

The general shape, for the fourth time this session: **one behaviour, two implementations, and only one of
them maintained.** Build 1320's shape list, 1320's zone-add list, 1326's zone pick/drag lists, and now the
pickup transform. When a client and a host must agree about something, they have to run the same function.

One pin moved (80).

## The gizmo reaches the whole level (build 1326)

Reported from play: *"For the player start, allow the gizmo y handle to move it for height placement. Make
sure all placed zones are clickable and have gizmo handles to drag their x, y, z location."*

Verified, and it was **three gaps between three hand-maintained lists**:

| | knew about |
|---|---|
| the CLICK resolver | death zones, jump pads, fire zones, ladders, audio zones — **not** triggers, water zones or effect zones, which could not be selected by clicking them at all |
| the DRAG write-back | six of the eight, and wrote only `.x` and `.z` — water and effect zones had no branch, so their handle moved nothing |
| the Y axis | discarded by **every** zone type, though each has a `y` its marker already draws (`baseY = +z.y`) |

And `pstart` did the same, under a comment reading *"player start lives on the floor"* — while the panel
directly beside it has had a **Height** slider for that exact field the whole time. Build 1087 had already
solved the identical problem for ENEMY spawn markers six hundred builds earlier: store the height RELATIVE
to the terrain so the marker rides terrain edits instead of being stranded in the air. Same rule here.

**`ZONE_EDIT` is one table**, read by both the picker and the drag, and `test-1326` asserts its keys are
exactly `ZONE_TYPES` — so the ninth zone type cannot reach two lists out of three. This is the third time
this session that a defect turned out to be a duplicated list (1320's shapes, 1320's zone-add, this).
`_zoneHitAt` walks UP the parents, because a marker is a *group* of rings and dots and the raycast hits one
of those. The refresh/panel hooks are direct function references, not names: a string-keyed dispatch would
reintroduce exactly what build 1271 removed.

Measured live driving the real `applyGizmoDrag` and the real click resolver:

```
pstart     drag to (4, 6.5, -3)  -> y 6.5, marker follows;  y -50 -> clamped 0
           on terrain 10, drag to 13 -> stores 3  (height ABOVE ground)
all EIGHT  placed; click resolves from a CHILD mesh to the right type; drag writes 7 / 5 / -9
```

**One thing this deliberately does NOT resolve, stated rather than silently picked.** The marker group sits
at `_maxTerrainOver(x,z,0)` and adds `+z.y`, while the gameplay containment tests (`inBand`) compare `+z.y`
against an ABSOLUTE feet height. On flat ground those agree exactly, which is why nobody has ever reported
it; on sculpted terrain they do not. Reconciling them means deciding the semantics across eight zone types
and their runtime tests — its own build. This one makes the handle honest about what it is setting.

Six pins moved (24, 338, 339, 507, 533), each keeping its intent through the table.

**A drafting note worth keeping:** two of the eight table entries kept string-valued `refresh`/`panel`
handlers because my edit script's anchors did not match their whitespace, and `_zoneRepaint`'s `try/catch`
swallowed the resulting `def.refresh is not a function` **silently** — the probe still showed correct x/y/z,
because those are data writes. The test caught it by counting `refresh:()=>` across the table. A `catch(e){}`
around a dispatch hides a wiring error perfectly.

## Level DATA is untrusted, not just level SINKS (build 1325 — platform audit 2.2)

The audit listed **four verified DOM-injection vectors from level data**. Re-verified against the current
tree first, because re-fixing closed findings is busywork:

| | sink | state |
|---|---|---|
| V1 | credits linkifier → `href="$1"` | **CLOSED by 1277** — `_creditEsc` escapes `"` and `'`, URL class excludes them |
| V3 | lock prompt | **CLOSED by 1277** |
| V4 | ammo prompt | **CLOSED by 1277** |
| V2 | `openInspect` title | **STILL OPEN** — one click from picking up any item |

**V2 survived a build that fixed three sinks precisely because the fix was at the sinks.** Escaping at the
point of use protects the sinks you remembered. So this build does the other half.

`invItems`, `keyNames` and `pickupModels` were the only level data loaded with a raw
`JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(...))` — no type coercion, no length cap, no entry cap, no `hasOwnProperty`
guard — sitting right beside prop strings that have been `String(x).slice(n)`-ed for hundreds of builds.
They are sanitised where they ENTER now, in all three load paths, with caps matched to the equivalent prop
fields (name 60, the use-* fields 30) so a creator meets one rule rather than four. `type` is a whitelist
because it selects a code path.

`openInspect`'s title is `textContent`, not an escape: **a title has no legitimate markup at all**, and the
weaker fix invites the next person to add markup back.

### Measured with a real hostile level (`tools/probe/xss-level.mjs`)

```
control      an unsafe innerHTML with the same payload DOES create the node  -> the probe can see it
the sink     0 img nodes, 0 script nodes, canary still 0 after a 500 ms settle
caps         name 60, desc 400, journal 4000, model 300; 500 items -> 199; "NaN please" -> 1
prototype    a JSON "__proto__" key does not pollute Object.prototype
1277's work  linkify still leaks no attribute
```

**The first run reported `pwned: 1` with ZERO nodes created in the sink**, which is a contradiction and was
worth chasing rather than reporting. The control block wrote the *same* payload into a real `<img>`, whose
`onerror` fires **asynchronously** — after the canary reset. A control that shares a canary with the
measurement is not a control. Separate canaries, and the reset moved to immediately before the sink.

### The bug the sweep turned up

`keyNames` and `pickupModels` **serialize** with the level and were loaded at boot and by the multiplayer
loader — and **`restoreLevel` had no line for either.** So the second level you opened kept the first one's
key names and pickup models, an imported level inherited yours, and a key rename could not be undone. Build
1280 unified the *prop* apply across the three loaders for exactly this reason; these two sat outside it and
nobody noticed, because two of the three paths agreed and the third was simply silent.

Four pins moved (115, 238, 879, plus one of my own regexes that spanned a line wrap).

## Wires and rails (build 1324 — editor audit 4.10, second leg)

Build 1323 closed the room; the other half of 4.10 is a **path**. The user's own case for it was the one
that shaped the design: **power cables and telephone wires** strung between poles. A fence, a kerb and a
catwalk are the same machinery with two differences that matter — a wire **sags**, and a wire must not be
**solid**.

**The path is the SELECTION, in selection order.** A click-to-place point mode is a whole input system;
typing coordinates is not authoring. Place your poles, select them in order, press the button — and it
composes with every selection feature the editor already has (1299's group-aware selection, 1310's
select-all, the marquee) for no new picking code.

**A parabola, not a catenary.** Visually identical at the sags a level uses, and unlike a catenary it needs
no root-finding, so it cannot fail to converge on a degenerate span. `sag` is the droop at midspan in
metres — a number a creator can see, rather than a tension coefficient they cannot.

**Orientation goes quaternion → Euler for both modes, deliberately.** three's Euler ORDER is a real trap
here and `setFromQuaternion` cannot get it wrong the way a hand-built yaw/pitch pair would — which would
have shown up as a silent twist on the first sloped segment. A wire maps local +Y (a cylinder's length) to
the segment; a rail is built from an explicit basis so it stays **upright**, with the dead-vertical case
handled.

### `noCol` — a real, serialized "decoration only"

Build 1093's `nocollide` convention keys off a mesh NAME, which only an imported model carries: a primitive's
name is never saved, so a "decoration" primitive would come back solid after one save/load and nothing would
say so. `noCol` rides the prop entry as `nc` through the file, the share link and the net, and it is exposed
in the inspector beside *Interactable* — because "this bush must not block the doorway" is a thing creators
want constantly and the only previous answer needed a 3D package.

**Writing the opt-out as "emit no boxes" was tried and measured wrong.**
`finalBoxes = boxes.length ? boxes : [obj.userData.box]` is build 1148's **fail-solid** fallback, so the
empty list silently became one box spanning the whole prop and the wire was solid after all — with the flag
set, correctly serialized, and every source pin passing. It has to **return early** and bypass the fallback,
which is exactly what build 1250's emitter case already did. *An opt-out expressed as an absence loses to a
fallback designed to fail closed.*

Unchecking it deletes the own `raycast` property to expose three's prototype method again — nothing else
restores it, and without that the checkbox would be one-way.

### Measured live (`tools/probe/path-tool.mjs`)

Two poles 20 m apart with 6 m tops:

```
anchors        (290, 6.20, 300) -> (310, 6.20, 300),  10 segments, one group
sag            highest 6.20, lowest 5.00   = exactly the 1.2 m setting, below the CHORD
endpoint       the last segment's drawn far end lands on the second pole to 0.0000 m
not solid      noCol set, collider boxes 0   (a pole beside it: 1)   insideSolid false
save/load      10/10 carry `nc`, 10/10 return noCol with ZERO collider boxes
rail           3-point curve -> 20 segments, worst tilt from upright 0.00 deg, all solid
```

**Two instrument failures again, and one of them was the same shape as build 1323's.** The endpoint check
called `pathAnchors()` *after* building — by which time `buildPathFrom` had replaced the selection with the
wire segments, so it compared the wire against itself and reported a 2 m error that did not exist. And a
zero-length span (a pole to itself, one shift-click away) let the sag term apply and drooped straight down
and back; it now collapses to a single point.

### Still absent

A floorplan tool — multiple rooms laid out at once — composes from 1323 by hand (duplicate, snap, drag),
which is a real answer but not the same thing. True CSG remains deliberately absent for the reason 1323
records.

## The room tool (build 1323 — editor audit 4.10, the last one)

> No CSG / room / spline tools; **a doorway is four boxes forever.** Ten primitives, grid snap, the arena
> generator. Mitigated but not solved. This is the honest ceiling on hand-built interiors and it is the same
> ceiling the previous audit found.

**CSG is the obvious reading and the wrong tool for THIS engine.** Build 1148 turns a mesh into a per-column,
per-slot collider box grid that every consumer walks. A boolean subtract buys you ONE opaque mesh with a hole
in it: more collider boxes, no editable parts, no instancing, and a doorway you cannot move afterwards
without re-cutting it. A room built from PRIMITIVES inherits everything the engine already has — gizmo,
snapping, materials, per-part collider, serialization, undo, duplicate, multiplayer — for no new code.

So a doorway is still boxes. It is boxes the creator never places, never measures, and can move by typing a
number, which is the part that was missing.

`roomPieces` is **pure** — spec in, box list out, no THREE and no DOM. That is what makes it testable
exhaustively instead of eyeballed: **3600 configurations, zero overlaps, zero interior intrusions, zero
degenerate pieces**, every door's clear gap equal to the authored width and head height to a millimetre, and
a wall carrying both a door and a window tiling itself with no holes.

Three conventions, stated once because everything depends on them:

- **The interior is exactly what you type.** 8 × 6 gives 8 × 6 of floor, not 8−2t. Interior-first is the only
  measurement that means anything when you are placing furniture in it.
- **`y` is a piece's BASE**, matching build 871's primitives and what `finalizeProp` lifts onto terrain.
- **N/S walls run the full outer width; E/W walls run the interior depth only.** They meet exactly at
  ±d/2. Overlapping them would double the collider at four corners and z-fight two coplanar faces; gapping
  them would let a bot through the corner.

### Two things the maths could not have told me

**A room on a slope sheared by 1.245 m.** `finalizeProp` lifts EVERY prop independently by
`_maxTerrainOver(x, z, footR)` — correct for a crate, ruinous for an assembly. On a 15% grade the walls sank
through the slab and the door header floated. The shell now takes ONE room lift and each piece pre-subtracts
the lift `finalizeProp` is about to add, so it lands flat on a pad like a real building foundation. **It
round-trips exactly**, because `propTuple` stores `position.y − _maxTerrainOver(...)` — which is the very
number passed in. Measured after: shear 0.0000 on flat *and* on the 15% grade.

**A 1.6 m doorway is exactly the player's diameter.** Radius 0.8, so at 1.6 the jamb test is a floating-point
coin flip — a body of that radius swept across the opening **did not fit**. Doors default to 2.0 m now
(20 cm either side), and anything under 1.8 warns *where the number is*, not in a manual. Build 1113 learned
this the same way for the generator: **author to the collider, not to the eye.**

### Three instrument failures, one after another

Worth recording because each produced a confident, wrong number:

| # | reading | what was actually wrong |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | "the doorway is clear at every height, and so is the wall" | `insideSolid(x, z, feetY)` called as `(x, y, z)`. **No control** — a sweep that never reports SOLID proves nothing. |
| 2 | "2.1 m of shear on flat ground" | The metric compared each piece's `y` to the floor top, so a door header's legitimate 2.1 m base read as shear. Shear is the spread of the per-piece **lift**. |
| 3 | "the doorway is blocked" (with a working control) | The room was built at the ORIGIN, and a **stock-level crate stands at (0, −3.15)**. Building it at (200, 200) reported 5.42 m clear — exactly 12 m of sweep − 8.6 m of wall + a 2.0 m door. |

#3 is build 1124's lesson (*know where the camera is*) and 1151's (*read WHO before attributing anything to
a surface*) for the third time in this session, now about a collision query. **Probe the scene before
believing the number**, and build the thing you are measuring somewhere nothing else lives.

### Still absent

Spline/path extrusion — a corridor swept along a curve — is the remaining leg of 4.10 and is its own build.
Multi-room floorplans compose from this one by hand (duplicate, snap, drag), which is a real answer but not
the same as a floorplan tool.

## Three papercuts with one measurement between them (build 1322 — editor audit 4.11, the rest)

**Five decimal places on a position in metres.** That is ten microns — and `STEP_POS` matched it, so an
arrow key on the field nudged a prop by **0.01 mm**. The most-used panel in the editor was both unreadable
and useless from the keyboard. Precision is per CHANNEL now (`FIELD_DP`: position 3, rotation 2, scale 3)
with **trailing zeros trimmed**, which is most of the win — a wall at x=12 reads `12`, not `12.00000` — and
the steps became 1 cm / 0.1° / 1 cm. `fmt` (the copy-paste block that bakes a tuned value back into the
source) deliberately keeps its five digits: there the extra precision is the whole point.

**The outliner rebuilt every row on a 160 ms coalesce during edits.** Measured with the real `_outRefresh`,
10 DOM nodes per row:

```
 56 rows   2.88 ms          256 rows   8.72 ms
106 rows   3.82 ms          456 rows  19.64 ms      superlinear: 0.019 -> 0.042 ms/row
```

At 456 props that is ~123 ms of teardown-and-rebuild **per second** while a gizmo drag keeps firing the
coalesce. And every one of those rebuilds was **wasted**: the outliner lists names, tags, folders, hide/lock
and selection — a transform appears nowhere in it.

So the fix is not virtualisation, it is *not doing the work*. `_outSignature()` joins exactly what the panel
renders, compared before the DOM is touched. The honest pair at 456 rows:

```
unchanged refresh   19.64 -> 0.12 ms
a gizmo drag                 0.16 ms      <- the case the coalesce actually fires on
GENUINELY changed           14.84 ms      <- essentially untouched
```

**The third number is why this is not a performance claim about the outliner.** The rebuild costs what it
always did; a virtualised tree is still absent, and it is a separate build with its own measurement. Two
details in the signature are load-bearing: it must cover everything a row can *render* (a displayed field
that is not signed is a stale panel), and the skip must also require that the body was built at least once,
or an empty panel with a stale signature stays empty forever.

**`libOpen` replaced unsaved work and relied on build 1254's one-deep rescue.** A rescue you have to know
about is not consent. The confirm goes in `libOpen` itself — which became the gate, with the open moved
wholesale to `_libOpenNow` — so every future entry point inherits it, and it fires only when `_levelDirty`:
a prompt on every open is trained away in a week and then not read. Three of `test-1262`'s pins moved to the
new function, all with their intent intact.

**Still open from 4.11, and deliberately:** `renderEditorFields` tears down and rebuilds the whole panel on
every change, with a scroll-restore microtask as the mitigation — which is why a text field anywhere in the
panel has to be `onchange` rather than `oninput`. That is an architecture change, not a papercut, and it
needs its own build and its own measurement.

## The + button sat under the file menu bar (build 1321)

Reported from play: *"the circle plus button gets slightly obscured with the file menu UI."*

Build 1083 added the menu bar (`position:fixed; top:0; height:30px; z-index:34`) and pushed `#editor` and
`#edToolbar` down for it. It stopped there. **The + FAB is a SIBLING of the panel, not a child**, so nothing
moved it: it stayed at `top:14px`, under a 30px bar, at z-index **31**.

Measured at 1280×720 with the editor open, before and after:

```
                circle top   px behind bar   elementFromPoint at the circle's TOP
before               14           16          mbSpacer      <- the BAR owns those pixels
after                44            0          edAdd
narrow (700px)       14            0          edAdd         <- unchanged, bar not wanted below 760
```

**`elementFromPoint` is the finding, not the rectangle overlap.** The bar's own filler element owned the top
16 px of the circle, so a click there went to the *bar* — a lost hit target on the button that adds
everything, not a cosmetic smudge. Rectangles alone could not have said that; z-index decides it.

The FAB's `top` moved **out of its inline `cssText` and into the stylesheet**, because an inline style beats
a class rule. `body.edMenuBar #edAddFab { top:44px }` — the 30px bar plus the original 14px gap, derived
rather than picked — keyed on the same body class `_edMenuSync` already toggles. So there is no JS, and no
future path that shows the bar has anything to remember. `placeFab` still owns left/right, which genuinely
depends on the panel width and dock side; only the vertical moved.

The three shift-down rules now sit in one block, which is the actual repair: 1083 wrote two of them and the
third didn't exist yet, and nothing connected them.

**A probe-instrument note worth keeping.** `page.setViewportSize` did **not** reliably deliver a `resize`
event here — the narrow re-measure first reported `menuBarShown: true` at 700px, which `_edMenuSync`'s own
`>= 760` rule makes impossible. The probe now calls `_edMenuSync()` directly and *prints the precondition it
just asserted*, because a measurement taken in a state you did not verify is not a measurement.

## The shape list was written out five times (build 1320 — editor audit 4.11)

The audit's last cluster was four small sharp edges in the "add something" path. **One of the four is false**,
and the other three are the same defect wearing three hats — plus a fifth instance the probe found on its own.

**KILLED: "new primitives ignore terrain height."** `finalizeProp` lifts EVERY prop by
`_maxTerrainOver(t[0], t[2], footR)` with no gate of any kind, and `propTuple` stores y terrain-*relative* so
the round trip survives re-sculpting. Measured with `terrainHeightAt` stubbed to 7.5: a box lands at 7.500, a
ramp at 7.500, stored tuple y 0. Primitives are base-at-origin, so that is exactly sitting on the ground.

The real defect: **the list of shapes the engine can build was written out FIVE times, and four copies had
drifted, each in a different direction.**

| copy | had | missing / wrong |
|---|---|---|
| `RADIAL_PRIMS` | 10 | — (the only one that never drifted) |
| the Object panel's Add-shape row | 9 | `pillar` |
| `PRIM_ICON` | 9 | `pillar` |
| the command palette | 9 | `pillar`, `wedge`, **plus a bogus `ramp`** |
| the `+` menu | 6 | `pillar`, `dome`, `tube`, `torus`, every model, all six emitters |

`pillar` was therefore reachable from exactly one surface out of five. And **`ramp` is not a key in
`PRIMITIVE_BUILDERS`** — the builder is `wedge`, `ramp` is its *label* — so the palette's "Add ramp" fell
through `isPrimitive()` and was handed to `loadGLTFCached` **as a model URL**. Measured before: it added
**zero props**, silently. Someone had written the label into the key list, which is why `PRIM_SHAPES` carries
**both**: `[key, label, glyph, common?]`. Deriving the palette from it fixes the entry in the direction its
author intended — "ramp" is what a creator types, `wedge` is what it builds — and the key rides in the
keywords so "wedge" still finds it. Measured after: **1 prop.**

`test-1320` asserts the table's keys **are** the builder keys *in both directions*, so a new primitive either
reaches every surface or fails the suite. That is the property five hand-kept copies could not hold.

**The `+` menu's zone list was a sixth copy — of `ZONE_TYPES` — and had drifted by exactly one entry:
TRIGGERS.** The volume the entire logic graph is built on could not be added from the menu build 650 calls
"the ONE place to add anything placeable". It iterates `ZONE_TYPES` now, and the if/else chain of adders
became `ZONE_ADDERS` keyed by the same string, so a type cannot be listed but unwired.

The menu also gains what it never had: `More shapes ▸` (the four uncommon shapes, selected by the table's own
`common` flag rather than a second list), `Effect ▸` (build 1250's six emitters, previously placeable from
the Object panel and nowhere else), and **`Model…`** — the commonest thing a level is made of. `_edRevealHost`
makes that entry *land*: it opens the sub-fold, opens the section around it and scrolls to it. A menu entry
that switches tabs and leaves its target collapsed two folds down is the same "nothing happened" build 1147
fixed for the asset browser.

**"(at me)" was false on eight buttons, and the number is what makes it a defect rather than a quibble.**
Every one places at `editorDropPoint()`, which is the point you are *looking at* while flying and the pan
centre in top view. Measured with the fly camera at (40, 25, −60) pitched down and the player at the spawn:
the drop point was **116.9 m from the player**. They say "(here)" now and share ONE `DROP_HINT` tooltip, so
the eight cannot disagree again; six empty-state hints that said "Stand where you want one" moved with them.

Measured live after (`tools/probe/add-paths.mjs`, editor open — the + FAB is an editor-session object, which
is how the probe's first run read `noFab` and measured nothing):

```
+ menu      6 shapes -> 14 entries, with More shapes ▸ [Pillar, Dome, Tube, Ring],
            Model…, Effect ▸ [6 emitters]
+ -> Zone   7 entries -> 8, led by ⚡ Trigger
Model…      mode=build target=props, fold NOT collapsed, browser rendered
palette     10 offered, 10 resolve to a real builder, every shape covered; "Add ramp" 0 props -> 1
button      "+ Add trigger (here)"  title="Drops where you're looking (a few metres in front of you…)"
```

**Nine pins moved, and one of them was the character-count trap again.** `test-241` scoped the + menu block
with `src.slice(pi, pi + 7600)`; the block grew and twelve assertions failed **with every one of them still
true** — precisely the failure recorded under *"a source pin must not be scoped by a character count"*. It is
not a function, so `extractFunction` cannot help; it now ends on the outside-click handler that has been its
last line since build 342.

## The part editor works on models you dragged in (build 1319 — editor audit 4.8)

> `renderModelParts`: `if(!/^https?:/i.test(url) || !/\.glb(\?|#|$)/i.test(url))` → a `local:` src (build
> 1177's drag-import) fails the test and gets *"Part editing works on direct .glb models"*, which is both
> true and useless. And the whole feature requires `_uploadAsset` → the founder's cPanel `upload.php`:
> offline or host-down, a creator cannot recolor a part of their OWN model. Two features shipped 20 builds
> apart that do not know about each other.

Both halves are **one misunderstanding**: the part editor reads bytes, edits bytes and writes bytes, and had
hardcoded one SOURCE (http) and one DESTINATION (the host). Neither is essential to what it does.

- `_bakeSourceBytes(url)` is the source. A `local:` url comes back out of build 1177's own IndexedDB store,
  by the same key scheme; anything else is fetched exactly as before. A model that is not on *this* device
  says so by name (`local model not on this device — re-import it`) — the one failure mode specific to a
  local import, and the one a generic "couldn't fetch" would have hidden.
- **A local model stays local.** Uploading the edited bytes would reverse the decision the creator made when
  they dragged the file in, and would fail on exactly the offline/host-down case the audit named. So the
  result goes back to IndexedDB under a FRESH key (`e<ts>/<base>-edit.glb`) — the original survives, the
  same as on the hosted path — and `done()` hands back a `local:` src. A failed save (storage full) says
  why and returns `null`, rather than swapping in a url that does not exist.
- **The gate asks the right question.** The old test asked WHERE the model lives; the right question is
  whether we can read its glb. `sketchfab:` is still refused with its own reason (its download is a one-time
  archive), and the general refusal now names *both* kinds that work, so it is a direction rather than a
  dead end.

Build 1177's publish warning is unchanged and still correct: an edited local model is still a local model,
so `levelIssues` still tells you it cannot travel.

**What the probe could and could not show** (`tools/probe/local-model-parts.mjs`): the bake needs
gltf-transform from a CDN and a real .glb to repack, neither of which exists in the sandbox. So it proves
the two things this build changes and stops at the library boundary, which it reports rather than papers
over — a blob put in IndexedDB came back through the bake's own reader as 12 bytes with the magic `glTF`; a
missing one threw the named error; the panel BUILT for `local:` and for an http `.glb` and still refused
`sketchfab:` and `.obj`; and `_bakeModelEdits` on a `local:` url reached *"Reading model…"* and then
*"✕ editor library unavailable (offline?)"* — i.e. the URL check no longer turns it away, which is the whole
change. `test-1319` executes `_bakeSourceBytes` itself through all four branches with stubs.

**A straight apostrophe in a comment can break `extractFunction` for an unrelated function.** Two harnesses
crashed this build with `no matching } from index 3422216` — pointing at `_creditLinkify`, which this build
never touched. The harness's brace matcher tracks quote state, and `_creditLinkify` contains quotes inside
regexes and strings that it already mis-parses; my new comments' `'` characters flipped the running parity
so the mis-parse landed somewhere fatal. The fix is to write `’` in prose comments (the codebase already
does this in strings — see build 1177's note about `—` escapes). If a harness fails naming a function
you did not edit, check the apostrophes you added, not that function.

## The logic graph shows its work (build 1318 — editor audit 4.9)

> `logicFailures` surfaced through `levelIssues` is good and was worth shipping. There is still **no live
> pulse, no wire highlight, no variable watch, no breakpoint.** The graph is now 22 node types, 26 verbs and
> an expression language — expressive enough that "why didn't that fire" is now a real question with no
> instrument. `_lgPulse` is one function; flashing the node DOM as it executes is ~15 lines and would be the
> highest-leverage editor addition in the file.

Two hooks and a painter:

- **`_lgPulse`** records the node, *after* it is resolved (so a wire pointing at a deleted node cannot
  invent a hit) and *before* the switch (so every node type is covered, including any added later). It also
  sits after the pulse-budget guard, so a wiring loop cannot flood the recorder either.
- **`_lgFollow`** records the wire, by index — the only change is `for…of` → an indexed loop.
- The painter pokes the DOM the renderer already built. It never calls `_lgRender`, which rebuilds the board
  wholesale and would fight every drag, every open `<select>` and every field being typed into.

**The COUNT is the half that answers the audit's actual question.** A node that lights up tells you it
fired. A node showing **no badge** after a minute of play tells you it never did — which is what "why didn't
that fire" is really asking. So the flash decays in half a second and the count stays until the board
closes, with an explicit RESET.

The **variable watch** is `logicVars` listed and sorted, with values that changed since the last frame
highlighted. That IS the graph's whole memory, so there is no subscription to author and nothing to keep in
sync. Both the name and the value are HTML-escaped — a level file authors both.

**It costs nothing when the board is closed.** `_lgTraceOn` is only true while the modal is up, so a
published level running someone else's graph pays one boolean per pulse and nothing else; closing cancels
the frame loop. Counts deliberately *survive* a close/reopen, because open-the-graph → play → come-back is
exactly how the question gets asked.

Measured on a real four-node graph in the real board (`tools/probe/logic-trace.mjs`), the fourth node wired
to nothing: one pulse recorded three nodes and two wires with **n4 absent**; ten pulses read `10` on three
DOM badges and **nothing on the fourth**; the fired node carried the accent glow and the unfired one did
not; wires went 2.5 px → 5.97 px; after the decay window the glow was gone and the badge remained; and with
the board closed, **a hundred pulses recorded exactly zero.**

Two pins moved (1027, 1169 — both drive `_lgPulse`/`_lgFollow` in constructed scopes and needed inert
stubs; those harnesses are about the graph's behaviour, and 1318 owns proving the recorder records).

## The weapon has inertia (build 1317 — gameplay audit F7)

> The viewmodel applies a vertical bob, ADS translation, recoil Z, reload dip, draw dip, melee thrust.
> **There is no look-sway** — no lag/counter-rotation from mouse delta — so the gun tracks a flick with zero
> inertia, which is the single most-noticed "cheap" tell in a first-person game.

The sway is a **first-order lag driven by the turn rate**, `x' = -k·x + u`, solved analytically across the
frame:

```
x  <-  x·e^(-k dt) + (u/k)·(1 - e^(-k dt))
```

**The first cut shipped an impulse-plus-decay with a comment claiming frame-rate independence "by
construction"**, on the grounds that the per-frame deltas sum to the same total across a turn. That is true
of the deltas and **false of the result** — the decay runs between them, so a coarse step under-counts.
Measured: the same 0.75 rad turn over the same 0.25 s gave **0.110 in 3 frames against 0.156 in 24**, a 42%
spread — a weapon that settles differently on two machines, which is the exact tell the build exists to
remove. The analytic form makes the claim true instead of restating it: 3, 6, 12, 24 and 60 frames now all
give −0.164.

Measured live through a real flick in the real frame loop (`tools/probe/vm-sway.mjs`): three frames of hard
turn peaked the sway at 0.226 on frame 5, swung the gun 0.024 world units and counter-rotated 0.095 rad, and
it was back at rest by frame 26. A steady 3 rad/s turn settles at `rate·gain/k` — the gun trails at a fixed
distance rather than running away. A 360 in eight frames clamps at 0.32 instead of throwing the gun off
screen, and crossing the ±π yaw wrap is unwrapped so it reads as 0.02 rad of motion, not 6.26.

Three things fold it out, each for its own reason:
- **ADS**, through the same factor the bob uses — a scoped weapon lagging behind the crosshair would be a
  different and worse defect.
- **Build 1313's motion-comfort sway slider.** The viewmodel is 11% of the screen and the most persistent
  moving thing in it; a player who turned camera sway down and still got a swaying gun would reasonably
  conclude the setting did nothing.
- The clamp, for a spin.

**The bob's vertical amplitude is deliberately unchanged.** The audit also called it near-invisible at 0.012
world units — but that is a taste judgement the headless harness cannot settle, and the missing *sway* is
what this build is about. What it did gain is a horizontal component at half the frequency, which turns a
vertical line into a figure-8: that is a structural difference between "a bouncing prop" and "a walk", not
a number.

**A sign convention worth recording**, because the test had it backwards on its first run and the code was
right: yaw DECREASES turning left, so `dy` and the sway go negative, and `gun.rotation.y = sway · ROT` then
turns the gun *right* while the view turns left. That is the lag.

## Aim assist, for sticks and thumbs only (build 1316 — gameplay audit F4)

> Greped `aimAssist`, `magnetism`, `stickyAim`, `snapTarget`, `adhes`, `friction` → the only hit is a
> twin-stick CURSOR nudge, which is for top-down aim, not stick aim. There is no rotational slowdown near a
> target, no bullet magnetism, no target snap. Rumpus ships a full touch layout editor and a gamepad prefs
> panel, so it clearly intends those inputs to be first-class; **a 3D FPS with zero aim assist on a stick is
> not.**

Both components, from ONE per-frame scan the pad and the touch pad share:

- **ADHESION** — look sensitivity drops to 55% dead on target and fades to nothing at an 8° rim. The
  falloff is **squared**, so the assist concentrates near the middle rather than smearing across the cone:
  the difference between "sticky" and "floaty".
- **MAGNETISM** — the view is pulled toward the target *in proportion to how hard the player is already
  turning*.

Four things it must never do, each of which is how aim assist earns its bad name:

- **Never for a mouse.** A mouse has no deadzone, no stick drift and no analogue floor; assisting it is
  just aiming for the player. Pinned: the mouse look path never reads the slowdown, and `_aaSlow` appears
  in exactly six places — declared, cleared, computed, and read by the pad and the two touch axes.
- **Never while the stick is still.** Magnetism with no input is a camera that moves on its own, which
  reads as broken rather than helpful. Two seconds at rest with a target dead ahead moves the view by
  exactly zero, while the *slowdown* stays live.
- **Never at a teammate, a corpse, a downed player, or through a wall.** It resolves the targets the game
  already considers shootable and asks the same segment test.
- **Never silently.** One slider in the controller panel; 0 turns it fully off.

Measured live against a real enemy 20 m away (`tools/probe/aim-assist.mjs`):

```
off target      0 deg    2      4      6      8     10
look slowdown   0.644  0.749  0.883  0.969  1.00   1.00

half a second of a HALF-DEFLECTED stick, the same input both times:
  4 deg off target   assist off: swept 20.05 deg   assist on: swept 4.23 deg
  nothing in view    assist off: swept 20.05 deg   assist on: swept 20.05 deg   <- IDENTICAL
```

### Three instrument errors in one build, all mine

The probe read `k = 0` everywhere on its first two runs and the code was right every time:

1. **The forward vector.** The engine's forward is `(-sin yaw, -cos yaw)`, so `yaw = π` faces **+Z** — the
   enemy has to go at +Z of the player. I put it at −Z and then reported `k = 0.55` for the case labelled
   "behind you", which should have been the tell.
2. **A wall.** The second placement ran a sightline the stock level has geometry across (`box z[26,35]
   y[0,1.2]`, another to y = 2.5). `segmentBlocked` correctly said blocked and the assist correctly
   declined. **Open ground had to be found, not assumed** — `(0,0)` is clear in all four directions.
3. **The sweep direction**, in the Node rig: with the target on the side the crosshair is turning *away*
   from, there is nothing to stick to, and the magnetism reads as ~4% instead of ~79%.

Build 1124's rule was "know where the camera is before you judge the frame". The general form, which this
build paid for three times: **before believing a null result, prove the instrument can produce a positive
one.** A probe that reports "no effect" has two explanations and only one of them is about the code.

Two pins moved (38 — touch drag now multiplies by the slowdown; and the test's own PvP fixtures, which had
the same +Z/−Z error).

## Enemies make noise when they move and when they notice you (build 1315 — gameplay audit F3)

> Cataloguing all 85 `SFX.*` call sites: enemies produce sound in exactly three places. No approach/footstep,
> no aggro/spot vocal, no sapper fuse. `SFX.step()` takes no `at` argument at all, so it can only ever be the
> PLAYER's own footsteps. **A brute closing from behind you is inaudible in a genre where audio does most of
> the threat detection.** This is also the cheapest large feel win available.

Build 1283 closed the two telegraphs and explicitly DEFERRED the footfall — *"a per-enemy step is
CONTINUOUS rather than event-driven; its value is entirely in the density, and 40 enemies in a wave is a mud
of overlapping noise if that is wrong."* That worry is what shaped this build: the density is **bounded**
rather than left to the wave size.

- **Distance-accumulated, not on a timer.** A step falls where the foot falls at any speed, and a staggered
  (build 1209) or wading enemy slows for free — no second tuning knob. Measured from the same
  previous-position pair the stuck detector uses, so an enemy grinding on a corner does not tap-dance:
  400 frames of scraping is **zero** footsteps.
- **Three limits.** A 30 m range gate (well inside the panner's own 55 m — a footstep you can hear across
  the arena is a hum); a per-tick budget of 3 beyond 12 m; and **no rationing inside 12 m**, because the
  enemy behind you is precisely the one that must not be cut. A sort would be fairer and costs an array
  every frame; the near-field exemption gets the same outcome for two comparisons.
- **Darker and quieter than the player's own step** (420/260 Hz against the player's 520), so the two stay
  tellable apart when both are running. `SFX.step()` is deliberately untouched and still has no `at`.
- **The sapper gets a fuse.** It is FASTER than you, so by the time its footsteps read as close it is
  already on you; the fuse ticks the whole approach and quickens from 0.5 s to 0.14 s as it closes.
- **The aggro vocal rides the EXISTING `aware` rising edge** — the one build 1214 put there for the logic
  graph's `onspot`, with the comment explaining that four things can set `aware` and watching it in one
  place means every one fires it and none fires it twice. That argument is exactly as true for a sound.

Verified live (`tools/probe/enemy-audio.mjs` — a real enemy spawned and walked at the player by the real AI,
every `tone`/`noise` recorded): a grunt at speed 8 walked 7 m in 5 s → 3 footsteps + a spot vocal; a brute
→ 1 footstep at 260 Hz; a sapper → footsteps + fuse ticks; **a grunt 75 m away → zero sounds.**

### The probe caught a TDZ that the boot test passed straight through

The constants were first declared beside the two functions that use them, 17,000 lines below the enemy
tick that resets the budget. The first frame threw `Cannot access 'ENEMY_STEP_BUDGET' before
initialization` — the temporal dead zone, which builds 838 and 1127 both recorded.

**`test-202-boot` PASSED**, because the throw happens inside the frame loop rather than during evaluation.
The live probe found it on its first run. **A boot test that executes the source is not a substitute for
running a frame.**

Also worth knowing, established while debugging it: `_enStep`, `_enemyFootstep`, `_sapperFuse` and
`updateEnemies` are **inside the enemy-AI closure**, not module scope — a probe can reach `shatterProp` and
the module-level constants but not those. Unit-level behaviour for anything in there belongs in a Node
harness with `extractFunction`; the probe drives it end to end instead.

Two pins moved (1077 — the edge line no longer ends at the event; 1283 — its "footsteps are deferred"
assertion became "deferred here, delivered in 1315", which is the more useful thing to pin).

## A custom prop sound REPLACES the engine's (build 1314)

Reported from play, three things in one message: *"There seems to be a default coded sound for when pressing
the fire button and impact on props, especially for melee. It plays the default AND the custom sound at the
same time. Can we remove the default sounds if there is a custom sound loaded? Also need the option to search
freesounds for prop impact noises. I'd also like a slot per-prop for a custom explosion or breaking sound."*

**The doubling is two systems that did not know about each other.** Build 1305 gave the PROP its own impact
clip; the generic `SFX.hit()` at the end of every swing and after every pellet has fired since long before
that. A creator who authors a wood-crate sound is *saying what the crate sounds like* — layering the
engine's 600 Hz sine on top is the engine talking over them.

- **The latch is a TIMESTAMP, not a return value** threaded through six call sites, because the host and a
  co-op client reach the sound by different routes (the host through `damageProp`, the client through its own
  prediction) and both land within a frame of the generic one. 80 ms is one frame at any rate the game runs
  and far shorter than two deliberate hits.
- **Set only on a play that actually happened.** `playSample` returns false until a buffer decodes; latching
  on the attempt would silence the fallback for the one hit that needed it.
- **Exactly the two prop paths are guarded.** Enemy, player, bot and turret hits are untouched. So is the
  **hitmarker** — that is information, not decoration, and the report was about the sound.

**A break slot, and ONE slot for break and explosion**, because for an explosive prop they are the same
event; two slots would mean authoring it twice and choosing which wins. It replaces `SFX.shatter`/`SFX.puff`
the same way, needs no debounce (a prop is destroyed once), and is warmed at deploy alongside the impact clip
— *especially* the break clip, since it gets exactly one chance to be right.

**Freesound is where the field is.** The browser already took a `{label, set}` direct target (used by audio
zones, signals, cutscenes, per-weapon shoot), so both slots open it seeded with the query a creator came to
run. The picked url applies to the **whole selection**, exactly as typing one does — a picker that acts on
one prop while the field beside it acts on thirty is a trap.

Measured live (`tools/probe/prop-sound-dedupe.mjs`, recording every sound start on both the sample and synth
paths): melee at a prop, 1 sound with a custom clip and 1 without; shooting a prop, the same; breaking, the
engine's 220 Hz synth without a break clip and the custom clip **alone** with one.

Four pins moved (1305 ×3 — the row became a builder called twice, so its label is an argument and its
userData key a variable).

## Motion accessibility (build 1313 — gameplay audit F9)

> Greped `colorblind`, `reduceMotion`, `prefers-reduced`, `a11y` → one CSS media query for UI animation,
> nothing that touches camera shake, the damage flash, motion blur or hitstop. **A player who gets motion
> sick from `addShake`/`postMotion` has no recourse inside the game.**

Every one of those was a hardcoded constant or a LEVEL setting the creator owns — so a player who cannot
tolerate camera shake could not turn it down in someone else's level, on any platform, at all.

Five per-device sliders in the pause menu (**Motion & comfort**): camera shake, camera sway, motion blur,
damage flash, kill slow-mo. Three decisions:

- **Per device, not per level.** This is a property of the person, not the content. It must survive
  switching levels and apply to levels other people made — which is the whole point, since a creator cannot
  be relied on to have thought about it.
- **A multiplier at the point of use, never a write to the level's values.** `worldCfg.postMotion` stays
  exactly what the creator authored; the preference scales it on the way to the shader. Writing it would
  save the player's accessibility setting into someone else's file.
- **Seeded from the OS.** A player who has told their system "reduce motion" has said it once; asking again
  is the accessibility failure one level up. `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` seeds a calm baseline on first
  run, and an explicit choice always wins after that — including the choice to turn it all back up.

**Defaults are 1 across the board**, so nothing moves for a player who never opens the panel: at 100% the
flash alpha is the same 0.55, the freeze is the same `rawDt*0.12`, `addShake` is the identity.

**The damage flash is dimmed, not removed.** At zero it still writes alpha 0.12 — a player who has turned
motion down still needs to know they are being hit. The slider dims the pulse; it does not delete the
feedback.

Two places the scaling had to go where it isn't obvious:
- **`addShake` is the chokepoint** — blasts, hits, kills, car impacts and the melee thump all route through
  it, so one scale covers them and the next one somebody adds. But two sites write `shake` directly (a car
  slam, a multi-kill punch); those are scaled too, because *a chokepoint you can go around is not one.*
- **Sway scales the TARGETS, not the springs.** The dip still settles and the lean still eases on their
  tuned curves; they just have less to travel. Scaling the spring rates would change the *feel* rather than
  the amount, which is not what the setting says.

Measured live at every site (`tools/probe/a11y-motion.mjs`): shake 0.40/0.20/0.10/0.00 at 100/50/25/0%;
flash alpha 0.55/0.333/0.12; a 0.62 authored blur reaching the shader as 0.62/0.31/0.00 with `worldCfg`
untouched; hitstop dt 0.00192/0.00896/0.016 (at 0 the clock never slows, and the countdown still runs so
nothing waiting on it can hang).

**The probe found a defect in the loader itself:** `loadA11y()` only ever ADDED constraints — a second call
with nothing stored and no OS preference left whatever the last call had written. It now starts from the
defaults every time. That only showed up because the probe called it twice.

Six pins moved (1210, 1220, 1238, 1246, 31, 437), each keeping its assertion's intent — and 1246's gained a
case, since a player who turns blur off must skip the whole velocity pass in a level that authored it on.

## The editor viewport answers to two fingers (build 1312 — editor audit 4.6)

> Top view pan is `mousedown` button 1/2 and zoom is `wheel` → **top view is unreachable on a phone**, and
> with it the marquee, which is top-view only. A touch creator has no multi-select at all beyond the
> outliner. No pinch-zoom anywhere in the viewport.

Verified at the lines: the pan handler returns unless `e.button` is the MIDDLE or RIGHT button, and the zoom
lives on `wheel`. A touchscreen has neither — so a phone creator could press Top, arrive fitted to the whole
arena, and never get closer or move sideways. **The view existed and was useless.**

```
TOP VIEW      two fingers drag -> pan          pinch -> zoom
PERSPECTIVE   two fingers drag -> look         pinch -> dolly along the view
```

**One finger is deliberately untouched.** Tap-select, gizmo drags, the marquee and the look-drag all run off
the existing pointer path; the handler ignores anything that is not exactly two touches and never calls
`preventDefault` on one. That is what makes the change additive rather than a rewrite of the input layer.

Every number is borrowed rather than invented, so the two inputs cannot disagree about the same view: the
pan reuses the mouse pan's own `(2*topZoom)/innerHeight`, the zoom clamps are byte-identical to the wheel's,
the look reads build 1281's sensitivity setting, and the pitch clamps at the same ±1.5.

**The dolly is logarithmic, not `1 - 1/scale`.** The ratio form is asymmetric — pinching out and back in by
the same amount leaves the camera somewhere new, which reads as drift and is the sort of thing nobody
reports; they just stop trusting the gesture. `log(scale) * 9` returns to exactly where it started (measured
live: −6.238 / +6.238 m).

Measured with real `TouchEvent`s at the real canvas (`tools/probe/editor-touch.mjs`): a 100 px two-finger
drag panned 111.11 world units with the zoom unchanged; a ×2 pinch took zoom 200 → 100 with the pan
unchanged; a held pinch hit floor 6 and ceiling 110, exactly the wheel's clamps; two-finger drag in
perspective moved yaw/pitch and left the fly position alone; **one finger changed nothing, and neither did
anything with the editor closed.**

### The suite caught a regression I was one commit from shipping

I also hid the on-screen touch sticks while editing, reading the audit's *"taps on the stick half do
nothing"* as the overlay swallowing half the canvas. Build 165's own test failed with `touch UI shows in the
editor` — and the assertion one line below it says why:

```js
if(isTouch){ if(touchMoveZ) flyPos.addScaledVector(fwd, -touchMoveZ*spd*1.5);
```

**The joystick is how a touch creator flies the editor camera.** Hiding it would have taken away their only
way to *move*, in exchange for making the left half tappable. Reverted. The stick half not selecting is a
trade-off that was made deliberately in build 165, not a defect — so **this build does not close that third
bullet**, and the entry should not be read as though it does.

Two things worth carrying: a decade-old-looking assertion with a terse message can be load-bearing, and the
line under it is usually the reason. And when an audit finding and a passing test disagree, **read the test's
neighbours before believing the audit.**

One pin moved (1281 — `_mouseSensNow` is now asked three times, because the touch look reads the creator's
own sensitivity rather than inventing a second one).

## A swing is an arc, not a laser (build 1311)

Reported from play: *"unless the character is directly facing the object with the cross-hair dead middle of
the prop, it doesn't deal damage. With a sword, if the player isn't dead on, even if it visually looks like
a strike landed, it doesn't count."*

**The asymmetry was twenty lines apart inside one function.** The ENEMY test is a cone — `cone()`, a ~69.5°
half-angle that has governed melee since it existed. Build 1295 gave the PROP test the player's origin and
the cursor-corrected direction (which fixed third person and co-op) but left it a **single ray through
screen centre**. So one swing hits an enemy standing anywhere in the arc and misses a crate the blade
visibly sweeps through.

Measured on the real swing against a real crate 2 m ahead (`tools/probe/melee-arc.mjs` — real
`_meleeStrike`, damage read off the prop):

```
yaw off-centre     0    5   10   15   20   25   30   40   50   60   75   90
before            HIT  HIT  HIT  HIT   -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -
after             HIT  HIT  HIT  HIT  HIT  HIT  HIT  HIT  HIT  HIT   -    -

pitch (chop down)  0   10   20   30   45   60
before            HIT  HIT  HIT   -    -    -
after             HIT  HIT  HIT  HIT  HIT  HIT
```

**15° → 60°.** And the two things that must not change are both still misses after: a crate 6 m away
(outside the reach) and a crate 2 m BEHIND the player — the arc is an arc, not a sphere.

Three decisions:

- **The test is against the prop's COLLIDER BOX, not its origin.** This matters more for a prop than for an
  enemy: a prop's origin can sit at its foot, at a corner, or metres away down the length of an imported
  wall, so an origin-based cone would miss a wall you are standing against. The closest point on the box is
  what the blade would actually meet.
- **A dead-on ray still wins.** It is tried first and gives the exact contact point, which the spark (1305)
  and the impact sound use; the arc is the fallback. Precision where it exists, coverage everywhere else.
- **No line-of-sight gate, deliberately.** Build 539 established that "at melee range the sightline is moot"
  for the enemy cone, and a prop test that disagreed with the enemy test is the defect being fixed.

`MELEE_ARC_DOT` is named **once** and read by both tests, so they can no longer drift — build 1143's lesson,
which is the same reason this bug was invisible: the enemy cone and the prop test were never written as one
thing. Two pins moved (135, 1295).

## The editor tells you what it can do (build 1310 — editor audit 4.7)

> The Edit menu is Undo / Redo / Delete-all. Absent from *every* menu, palette and panel: Copy, Paste,
> Duplicate, Group/Ungroup, Array, Align, Snap toggle, Select-all (which does not exist — no `Ctrl+A`),
> Local/World space. The `Ctrl+K` palette covers actions and settings but not objects and not Redo.

**A shortcut nobody can discover is, for most creators, the same as not having the feature.** Every command
the audit named already existed and had a key; none had a way to be found. Select-all did not exist at all.

- **`Ctrl+A` selects every prop** — new capability, not just a new menu row. It skips **locked and hidden**
  props for exactly the reason the marquee does (build 1036): locked exists so a sweeping gesture cannot
  pick something up, and a select-all that ignores it is the most destructive gesture in the editor. It also
  skips runtime props (not level content; the next Deploy deletes them). It **says how many it skipped**, or
  "select all" silently means "select most".
- **`Esc` clears the selection** — and claims the key ONLY when there is a selection, so dialogs, the
  animation editor and the big map (all of which handle Escape above this line and return) keep it.
- The **Edit menu** carries twelve labelled commands with their shortcuts shown, which is how anyone learns
  a shortcut in the first place.
- The **palette** gained every object command, Redo, and nine generated Align entries — with the shortcuts
  themselves as search terms, so typing the half-remembered `ctrl+g` finds Group.

**The first draft listed `Esc` in the menu before Esc did anything.** That is the exact defect build 1306
fixed in the animation tab — the UI must not lie about the engine — so the key was implemented rather than
the label dropped. Worth stating because the temptation in a discoverability build is to describe what you
wish were true.

Measured in the live editor (`tools/probe/editor-commands.mjs`): the real `Ctrl+A` selected 59 of 64 props
with the locked and hidden ones provably absent; `Esc` cleared it and left the editor open; **`Ctrl+A` inside
a focused text field selected the 9 characters of text and zero props**; the Edit menu read back twelve
labelled commands; every object command in the palette ran and restored its toggle.

## Props can ride other props (build 1309 — editor audit 4.5)

> Zero greps for `parentTo|attachTo|userData.parent|parentNid`. Groups are a shared `groupId`; folders are
> outliner metadata. Consequences that show in play, not just authoring: a crate on a moving platform does
> not ride it, `moveprop` is a teleport, a rotating assembly must be authored as one mesh. Build 997's
> light-attach and build 1228's entry carry are a *special case* of parenting implemented once; generalising
> them is the structural fix.

A child names its parent by **nid** — the same stable serialized identity build 997 uses, and the only one
that survives a save, a reload and a co-op join.

**IT IS A FOLLOW CONSTRAINT, NOT SCENE-GRAPH RE-PARENTING.** That is the load-bearing decision.
`host.add(child)` is right for a LIGHT because a light has no collider, no physics body and no serialized
transform of its own. A prop has all three: `colliders` holds world-space boxes, `serializeLevel` writes
`o.position` as a WORLD transform, and the gizmo drags in world space. Re-parenting silently turns every one
of those into a *local* transform — a level that saves wrong, a collider in the wrong place, and a gizmo
that fights the creator. Applying the parent's per-frame delta leaves all three invariants untouched.

- **Depth-ordered**, so a chain (a crate on a lift on a barge) settles in ONE frame rather than lagging a
  frame per link — verified with `propModels` deliberately in the wrong order.
- **Rotation is about the parent's ORIGIN, and the child turns too.** Otherwise a prop slides round a
  turntable facing one way, which is the audit's third case only half-solved.
- **Cycles are refused** at the point of authoring, and a cycle arriving from a hand-edited file is broken
  on load rather than looping forever.
- **A deleted parent releases its children where they stand** — `removeProp`, which every deletion goes
  through — rather than leaving them pointing at a dead nid.

**It inherits the existing mover story rather than reimplementing it.** Two one-line changes: `_cgMobileNow`
counts a parented prop as a mover (or its per-frame collider refresh would rebuild the static spatial grid
every frame — build 1188), and `addStaticColliderFor` gives it the same **kinematic** body a mechanism-
animated prop gets, so `updatePhysics`'s existing driver sweeps it and a dynamic crate resting on a parented
platform is carried and launched exactly as it is by a mechanism. That is what "generalising them" meant.

Measured live (`tools/probe/prop-parenting.mjs`): a platform slid 5 m carried its crate to x=5 **with its
collider centre at 5** — a mesh that rides while its collider does not is worse than no feature; a three-link
chain resolved in one frame; a 90° turn swung a crate 3 m off-axis from (+3,0) to (0,−3) at an unchanged
radius with its own yaw turned 90°; both children serialized; deleting the parent left the crate exactly
where it stood.

### The probe found a build 1305 regression I had shipped

```js
if(o.userData.breakable===false) e.brk=false;
if(o.userData.hitSnd) e.hsn = …;        // <- build 1305 inserted this HERE
else { hp, breakStyle, objective, explosive … }
```

The `else` re-bound to the impact-sound test. **Any prop carrying a hit sound had stopped serializing its
health, break style, objective flag and explosive settings.** 1305's own round-trip probe missed it because
it only checked the field it had just added; 1309's checked the *whole* entry with and without the sound and
they now match field for field. Two lessons, both now written into the source at the site:

- **Never put a statement between an `if` and its `else`** — this file's dense one-line style makes the
  dangling `else` invisible, and a serializer is where it costs the most.
- **A round-trip test that only checks the new field is not a round-trip test.** Compare the whole entry
  against the same entry without the feature.

`par` also went in at the top level of `propEntry`, not inside the `if(o.userData.phys)` block where the
first draft put it: **a static crate on a lift is the commonest case of all**, and it would have silently
never saved.

## Enemies move with mass (build 1308 — gameplay audit F8)

> Enemy translation is direct position integration — `en.mesh.position.x += _mvx*spd*dt`, and the same at
> the strafe and the lunge. There is no velocity state and no acceleration, so an enemy reaches full chase
> speed on frame 1 and stops dead on frame 1. Facing *is* smoothed (`turnToward` at `TURN_RATE`), which
> makes the mismatch more visible, not less: the body rotates while the position slides sideways. This is
> exactly the defect build 1171 fixed for the player and did not port to the AI.

Verified still live at all five sites, and closed with 1171's model and 1171's safe-change constraint: the
TARGET is the same `dir * speed` the old code wrote directly, so **every authored speed, standoff, patrol
pace and slow-zone multiplier is byte-identical at steady state** — proven to 1e-9 across seven speeds and a
diagonal. What changes is the ramp on either end.

Four decisions:

- **Slower than the player, deliberately.** 11/16 against the player's 14/20. You are the one with the crisp
  controls; a wave that starts and stops as sharply as you do reads as a swarm of cursors.
- **`_enStep` returns a CANDIDATE position rather than writing one**, because two callers — the strafe and
  the charger's dash — must test the step against `insideSolid` before taking it. The velocity is chased
  either way: an enemy pressed against a wall has genuinely spent that acceleration.
- **A frame that commands no step BRAKES.** A charger telegraphing its lunge, a gunner at its standoff, a
  patroller that arrived. `_wantMove` (build 541) is already false in exactly those cases, so an enemy that
  stops now *looks* like it stopped.
- **The dash still writes its own position but seeds the velocity**, so a charger carries its momentum out
  of the lunge instead of stopping dead in mid-air — the most visible frame of the whole move.

**The anti-overlap separation is deliberately NOT routed through it.** That is a CORRECTION, not locomotion;
giving it mass would reintroduce build 995's vibration, whose real stabiliser is the `(minD-d)*0.5` term
(build 1154 established that).

**The blend is `1 - exp(-k·dt)`, not `k·dt`.** Build 1171 uses the linear approximation for the player, and
measured with it here, half a second of chasing covered **3.56 m at 20 fps against 2.92 m at 240** — a 22%
spread on the same input, i.e. the same wave covering different ground on different machines. That is small
enough never to have been noticed on the player and not worth a re-tune of every authored speed to change
there, but there is no reason to reproduce it in new code: the exact form costs one `Math.exp` per moving
enemy per frame and reproduces the continuous solution at any step (asserted against `S(1-e^{-kt})` at six
refresh rates). It is also self-clamping, so a dt spike still degrades to the old instant speed rather than
overshooting — at a 30-second stall it is still under the target.

**The one real regression risk, measured rather than argued.** Build 540's stuck recovery counts a frame as
no-progress when travel is under 30% of top speed and wall-follows after 0.2 s of it — and a ramp starts
below 30% *by design*, so this could have made every enemy begin every chase by wall-following. Swept from
20 to 240 fps, the start-up accrues at most **32 ms** against that 0.2 s trigger. Pinned, because a future
change to either constant could close that gap silently.

One pin moved (1209 — the stagger factor is now a term of the target velocity rather than of a per-frame
position delta; same four moves, same factor).

## A state is level-triggered. An event is edge-triggered. (build 1307)

Third report of the same freeze, and this sentence is the whole diagnosis:

> *"I can replicate it by rapidly hitting the left mouse button. It still deals damage, but doesn't play the
> animation. If I click, wait a second, and click again, it doesn't freeze."*

**A swing is an EVENT that the state machine reports as a STATE for as long as its clip lasts.**
`meleeAttack` calls `playOwnAnim('meleeHeavy', <the clip's own length>)` and `updateOwnAvatar` returns that
slot every frame until the window expires. The crowbar swings every **500 ms** and a swing clip is typically
**~1 s**, so the second swing arrives while the first is still being reported — the requested name never
changes, `animState === key` short-circuits, and the clip is never replayed. Leave a gap and the event
expires, the state falls back to idle, and the next click is a real transition.

That is exactly "click, wait a second, click again" working while rapid clicking does not. **And it explains
the half of the report I had been reading past for two builds: the damage is edge-driven and kept landing;
the animation is level-driven and did not.**

Reproduced and fixed on the real chain (`tools/probe/melee-retrigger.mjs` — a rigged body, real actions, the
real `meleeAttack → playOwnAnim → updateOwnAvatar → setEnemyAnimState` path, a 1.0 s swing clip against the
crowbar's 500 ms fire rate):

```
                                 swings   clip restarts   final clip time
before  rapid (500 ms)              9           0         ran on to 0.85, never replayed
before  rapid + Hold on Attack      9           1         1.00 — CLAMPED ON ITS LAST FRAME. Frozen.
before  spaced (1600 ms)            4           3         works
after   rapid                       8           6         alive
after   rapid + Hold on Attack      9           9         0.25, mid-swing
after   spaced                      4           4         works
```

The fix is not a special case for the swing. `setEnemyAnimState(body, state, restart)` — the **caller** says
whether this is a new event, and a new event replays even when the resolved slot name is unchanged.
`playOwnAnim` stamps a serial, so ONE mechanism covers every one-shot the local avatar plays: swings,
grenades, `equip` on a fast weapon swap, back-to-back hit reactions, custom actions. Firing rides `lastShot`
the same way, so a second round inside the 250 ms attack window re-fires the pose instead of being swallowed
as "already attacking". A respawn clears the serials, or a fresh run swallows its first swing.

**Three builds, three different mechanisms, and only the third was the reported one:**

| build | mechanism | was it real |
|---|---|---|
| 1304 | a one-shot request stamped `LoopOnce` onto the looping slot it fell back to | real, still fixed |
| 1306 | `animState === key` latched a stranded action permanently | real, still fixed |
| 1307 | a repeated one-shot could not RE-TRIGGER | **the reported one** |

**What I should have done sooner.** 1304 and 1306 were both reasoned from the code, and 1306's own entry
admits it could not reproduce the report. The thing that solved it in one run was the user handing me a
deterministic repro — *rapid clicks freeze, spaced clicks do not* — and my building a probe that drove BOTH
cadences with a control. Two builds of plausible mechanisms cost more than the harness would have. The
existing rule in this file is "probe the mechanic's own inputs in the live game" (1244); the sharper form is
**a report that contains a timing contrast is describing the mechanism — reproduce the contrast first.**

Five pins moved (204, 275, 276, 367, and 1306's own), each keeping its assertion's intent.

## The animation state machine repairs itself (build 1306)

Reported AGAIN, after build 1304 claimed it: *"stuck in the idle position, no animation, but I can still
move them around the screen. If I run a distance away from the props I was hitting at, it picks back up."*

1304's fix is real and stands. It was not enough, and this build deliberately does **not** name a third
cause. It removes the thing that makes ANY stranded action permanent:

```js
if(v.userData.animState === key) return;   // "already there"
```

Every other part of this system is recomputed every frame and therefore self-correcting. **That one line is
a latch.** Once the current action stops running, the machine asks for the same state, recognises the name
it already holds, and returns — forever. Asking for a DIFFERENT state is the only escape, which is exactly
why the reporter found that running away recovered it. Three ways an action stops running, all live in this
engine:

- three **disables** an action whose fade-out completes (`_updateWeight`: `if(interpolantValue === 0)
  this.enabled = false`).
- a `LoopOnce` action stops advancing on its final frame.
- a **zero-weight** action writes no bones — which does not reset the skeleton, it FREEZES it wherever it
  was. That is precisely "stuck in the idle position".

So the early return now checks that the state it short-circuits is ALIVE (`_animLive`), and re-arms it if
not. Two things it must not do, and both are pinned:

- **A HELD state returns first, before the liveness test.** A corpse clamped on its last frame is the point
  of holding, not a stall, and an authored `clipHold` is honoured the same way.
- **A state entered moments ago is mid-crossfade with its weight ramping from zero**, which reads exactly
  like a stall. `ANIM_LIVE_GRACE` (260 ms, against a 180 ms crossfade) is what stops a fade-in re-arming
  itself every frame — without it the repair would be a worse freeze than the bug, and one that would only
  appear on fast machines.

A re-arm does not crossfade (there is nothing to fade *from* but itself), and `animAt` is stamped on entry
because that is what the grace measures.

Verified live on a real `AnimationMixer` with real actions (`tools/probe/anim-strand.mjs`): stranded four
ways — disabled, clamped on its last frame, zero weight, paused — the real `setEnemyAnimState` repaired
every one **without a state change**; a healthy action was left byte-identical (time 0.42 preserved, zero
restarts across ten simulated seconds); a clamped death pose stayed down; and a state entered that instant
at weight 0 re-armed **zero** times in ten calls.

**And the editor had been lying about which slots hold.** The hold checkbox defaulted to `stKey === 'die'`
while the runtime default is `_ANIM_ONESHOT.has(key)` — thirty-odd slots. Reload, Jump land, Equip and Move
start/stop all showed as looping in the editor while the engine played them once. Both tabs (player and
enemy) now default to the runtime rule. This changes no behaviour; it stops the UI contradicting it.

**Stated plainly: this is a structural repair, not a pinpointed root cause.** The freeze could not be
reproduced headless — the stock third-person body is the stylised capsule and carries no `stateActions`, so
the probe had to synthesise a rigged one. What the probe DOES prove is that the latch is gone: whatever
strands an action, the next frame repairs it.

## A prop sounds like what it is made of (build 1305)

Reported with the melee-timing report: *"there needs to be a way to add a per prop hit sound, so if I'm
hitting a wooden crate with an axe, it sounds like the box is hit with an axe; if I hit a metal barrel, it
should sound like metal hitting metal. It would also be nice to have some sort of visual that the blow
landed, maybe with some small particles etc."*

One url per prop (`userData.hitSnd`, serialized as `hsn`) — **level data, not a device setting.** The material
of a crate belongs to the crate and has to travel to whoever plays the level, which is the one way this
field differs from every other row `_sndRow` builds; that helper gained a fourth `save` parameter so the
prop row can opt out of `saveAudioSettings` rather than misusing it. The field is GROUP-WIDE by build 1299's
rule (a level has thirty wooden crates and one wood sound) and says so with the same banner.

`damageProp` is the one place a bullet, a swing, an explosion and a client's relayed `propHit` all pass
through, so the sound lives there. Two rate limits, each answering a real firing pattern rather than a
guess:
- **A shotgun lands eight pellets in ONE frame.** Eight copies of one buffer starting on the same sample is
  not eight hits, it is one hit ~18 dB louder with comb filtering — hence `PROP_SND_GAP` (55 ms, per prop).
  It is shorter than any weapon's fire rate, so an SMG at 90 ms still sounds on every round.
- **An explosion damages every breakable prop in its radius in one pass.** The per-prop gap cannot see that,
  because they are different props — hence `PROP_SND_BURST` (4 starts per 60 ms window, across props).

**A guest predicts its own hit.** `damageProp` runs on the HOST, so without a local call the player who
swung would be the only one in the match who did not hear the crate they hit. Both client send-sites
(shot and swing) play it locally.

**The spark went to the melee path, NOT into `damageProp`.** The bullet path has sparked at its own hit
point since long before this, so a spark at the chokepoint would draw two on every shot; an explosion has a
blast. The swing had nothing at all until the prop broke, which is the whole of "no visual that the blow
landed".

`playSample` returns FALSE until a buffer decodes, so `preloadPropHitSounds()` warms every prop's clip at
deploy beside build 750's signal clips — without it the first hit on every crate in the level is silent.

Measured live (`tools/probe/prop-hitsound.mjs`, which replaces `playSample`/`spark` in the game closure and
records): a real crowbar swing at a real crate played the authored url at the contact point [0, 1.70, 31.50]
with vary 0.08 and drew one spark there; eight `damageProp` calls in one frame played it ONCE; twelve props
in one explosion played four times at four distinct positions (the null-point fallback to each prop's own
position); the url survived a full `serializeLevel()` round trip; a prop with no url played nothing.

Four pins moved: 482 (its `damageProp` harness needed the new stub), 975 (`_sndRow`'s signature — converted
to `extractFunction`, build 1149's rule), 1295 (the client branch it pins gained a trailing call), 1299
(`_selBanner` count 4 → 5).

## Auto-exposure (build 1180) — PHASE 3 OPENS

toneMappingExposure was a static authored value — desert noon into a dark interior, nothing adapted; every
competitor ships eye adaptation by default. The meter blits `_postRT` through `_matCopy` into a 16x16 target
(the blit also RESOLVES a multisampled _postRT, so both adaptive rungs read safely), log-averages luminance
every 5th frame (~12Hz — the readback is not a per-frame stall), and eases a MULTIPLIER around the authored
exposure with tau 0.9s. Post-ACES metering is deliberate: exposure moves → the metered value follows → the
feedback loop CONVERGES. Authorship survives three ways: ±1.5-stop clamp around `_expBase` (the authored
exposure × the colorV legacy factor — captured where 16444 used to set the renderer directly; renderer now
always gets base × multiplier), a 0.15-EV dead-zone so a balanced frame never breathes, and
`worldCfg.autoExp` (0..1, default 0.7, slider beside Exposure) where 0 snaps cleanly back to exactly the old
static behaviour. A failed readback falls to neutral instead of throwing mid-frame. One pin moved (1115 —
same derivation, captured as the base). NOT capture-verified headless yet — the stock frame is outdoor and
balanced (inside the dead-zone by design); the visible proof needs an interior, which is exactly the case it
exists for. Verify in browser: walk under the arena structures and watch the lift.

## Authored wave manifests (build 1179) — PHASE 2 COMPLETE

Random-mode composition was a hardcoded formula (n = 3 + wave*2, thresholds for the mix); "wave 3 = 2
brutes + a shielded from the north gate" was unauthorable. Manifests are a MINI-LANGUAGE (the dialogue
system's precedent — a textarea beats a widget forest), one line per wave: `3x grunt, 2x runner @gate`,
`-` for an intentional breather, blank = pure formula. `@tag` clusters the squad on the tagged prop with
the logic-spawn ring; no tag scatters at the arena edge like the formula. Caps: 20/term, 40/wave, 2
bosses, 50 waves; unknown types demote to grunt; a missing tag falls back to the edge (never (0,0)).
Waves PAST the manifest fall back to the formula so endless still escalates, and a manifest wave never
gets the automatic milestone boss — the author owns its composition (this falls out of structure: the
milestone boss lives in randomWaveDescriptors). The SOURCE text serialises (`game.wavesText`, 2000 chars)
and both loaders re-parse it, so the editor round-trips exactly what was typed. Two serializer pins moved
(33, 62). Phase 2 of the critic roadmap is complete.

## Chat gets a filter and a mute (build 1178)

The platform critic: chat capped length and escaped HTML but never filtered CONTENT. The filter runs
CLIENT-SIDE AT RENDER — a hostile peer can send anything; what matters is what is shown. Stranger links
collapse to [link] (the top P2P harm vector), a baseline profanity list masks in place after
leet-normalisation (0→o 1→i 3→e 4→a 5→s 7→t @→a $→s), and your OWN text shows as typed. `/mute Name` /
`/unmute Name` are local commands intercepted in sendChat BEFORE display-or-send; mute is per-session by
display name because the relay carries names, not ids (a renamed troll costs one more /mute — accepted for
v1). Substring matching catches embedded words (Scunthorpe) — the accepted trade for catching leetspeak.
Deferred: a report affordance needs the lobby backend. AND: hit the mid-line-`//`-comment trap AGAIN
(documented in 1168) — the addChatLine insert swallowed its own one-line tail; the syntax check caught it.
Use /* */ when patching one-liners, no exceptions.

## Your own .glb without their server (build 1177)

The editor critic's "asset import requires their server", verified: no local model path existed at all —
offline or host-down, a creator could not use their own asset. A dropped .glb/.gltf (viewport drag-and-drop,
editor only — play never hijacks a drag) is content-hashed (SHA-256, time-key fallback on http origins),
stored as a blob in its own IndexedDB db (`rumpus_local_models`), and resolved by a `local:` src scheme
through a branch BESIDE `sketchfab:` in `loadGLTFCached` — same cache, same waiter/pump, same
GLTFLoader/manager so codecs still apply. `isModelSrc` learned the scheme (cache accounting, part editor,
model release all follow). The filename rides the key so the asset browser shows a name, size capped 64MB,
and the sharing story is honest three ways: the import toast says "this device only", the Level Check warns
before publishing, and on another device the load fails into 1167's missing-model report instead of hanging.
The server upload remains the "make it shareable" step. Note: the codebase deliberately writes `\u2014`-style
escapes inside JS strings (307 of them) — a python-edit anchor containing a real em-dash will miss those
lines; match the escape or anchor elsewhere.

## The editor gets a clipboard (build 1176)

There was NO clipboard — carrying a configured object between levels meant formalising it into a prefab.
Ctrl+C serialises the selection through the same `_pfEntryOf` pair duplicate (1162) and prefabs use — full
config, identity stripped, pivot-relative so arrangements survive — into `_propClipboard` AND the system
clipboard as tagged JSON (`format:'rumpusprops'`), which makes paste work across levels and TABS. Ctrl+V
prefers the system clipboard (may be newer; only its own tagged format is accepted from that untrusted
text), falls back to memory when `readText` is refused, spawns at the editor drop point through the
loader-mirroring `_pfSpawnEntry`, groups a multi-prop paste under ONE fresh gid, selects the result, takes
one undo snapshot (Ctrl+Z removes the whole paste), and caps hostile pastes at 100 entries. Copy YIELDS to
a real text selection and only preventDefaults when something was actually copied; with no multi-selection
it falls back to the primary prop, which is the desired UX (the test initially got that wrong, not the
engine). Paste sanitisation note: pasted entries go through the exact apply block level files already go
through — nothing looser.

## Corpses lie on the floor, not in it (build 1175)

Reported from play: capsules AND the feet-origin chub GLB sank partway through the floor on death. Build
994's fallback death lowered every toppling corpse by a HARDCODED 1.0. A capsule (radius 0.7, centre
origin) needs 0.7 — buried 0.3; a feet-origin GLB needs to RISE by half its width — dropped a metre
underground. `_fallbackDeath` now applies the FINAL topple quaternion once at death, measures the real
lying bbox, and solves the y that rests its bottom exactly where the standing bottom was (`dy = box0.min.y
- box1.min.y` — sign handles both pivots with no special cases); the sink phase descends by the measured
lying thickness. Unmeasurable meshes fall back to the old constants. test-994's pin moved from the
hardcoded offset to the PROPERTY (lying bbox bottom ≈ ground), which is what that build always meant.

## Curved props stopped swallowing enemies; enemies learned to hop (build 1174)

Two play reports, each verified to a mechanism. (1) CLIP-THROUGH: 1158's edge exemption reads a curved
prop's flank as LOW near the silhouette (sphere/cylinder/dome), exempting the enemy INTO the footprint —
and once its centre crossed the box, the resolver's `d > 1e-4` gate meant no push ever again. 1158's probe
tested wedges/boxes, never a curved prop. Now centre-inside-box is HANDLED: expelled along the shortest
horizontal exit, capped 0.3/frame, unless the enemy is standing ON this collider's surface at its own
column (mid-ramp/stairs protected — the surface is at its feet). Outside the footprint the ordinary push
owns the rim, so through-traffic is dead. (2) STUCK BEHIND PROPS: the nav grid marks slab-tops walkable
within JUMP reach (NAV_UP derives from the jump apex) — semantics the BOTS execute (`wp.jump`, build 620)
but PvE enemies silently ignored, so the path said "hop the slab" and the enemy ground against the very
obstacle its route crossed. Enemies now honour the hint via the trap launch-arc machinery (`en.vy=JUMP`,
`launchY` integrator), with the bots' 0.9s cooldown so a tall wall isn't jackhammered.

## The gizmo learns local space (build 1173)

The editor critic, verified: every drag axis in `tryGizmoGrab` was a WORLD unit vector — a wall rotated 30°
could not be slid along its own length. A World/Local toggle (persisted, `breach_gizspace`) now rotates the
translate axes, per-axis scale handles and rotate normals by the PRIMARY object's quaternion via
`_gizmoRefQuat()`, and `updateGizmo` turns the visual to match — the handle you see is the axis you get.
Three things that made this small: scale MATH needed no change (it always scaled the object's own
components; only its handles pointed wrong in world mode); the rotated axis is stored IN the drag, so
`applyGizmoDrag` and the group path inherit it with zero changes; and lights/zones/markers return null from
the resolver (they are unrotated — world IS their local), as does a missing primary, so world mode is
byte-identical to before. Snap composes unchanged: `_snapAlong` snaps the component along whatever axis the
drag carries. FOURTH container rollback recovered during this build — same signature (906 harnesses), same
one-command recovery; the scripted-edit habit made the re-apply free again. (Also twice now: a heredoc
python step run from tests/ silently missed CLAUDE.md — run docs edits from the repo root.)

## Reload cancel + per-weapon draw (build 1172)

The panel's "reload jail", verified then opened: `reload()` was a setTimeout that always completed and
`switchWeapon` hard-returned `if(reloading)` — a 1.6s sniper reload locked out every response while a
charger lunged. Now switching CANCELS the reload via a token: the pending timeout completes only if its
token is still current, so a cancelled reload leaves the mag exactly as it was (test-1172 proves the stale
timeout is a no-op and reserve debits once), and the cost of cancelling is honest — two draw times. Draw is
per-weapon (`drawMs`: pistol 220, shotgun 340, sniper 420, launcher 450, fists 200, rifle/smg default 300)
with the viewmodel dip dividing by the same `_drawDur`, so a slow draw dips long instead of popping. Three
pins moved (227, 229, 965). Deferred from this item: shotgun shell-by-shell reload — its own build.

## Movement has mass (build 1171)

The gameplay critic's #1 feel finding: `player.vel = wish*sp` TELEPORTED velocity to the input every frame —
zero start-up weight, dead-stop on key release even mid-air (release W at the apex and the arc collapsed),
instantaneous 180s. Velocity now chases the target exponentially; the safe-change constraint is that the
TARGET is `wish*sp`, so every tuned speed is byte-identical at steady state. Four rates (the four situations
differ): ACCEL 14 (95% of top speed in ~210ms), BRAKE 20 (a run stops in ~0.6m — crisp, genre-typical),
AIR 3.5 (course corrections work, cannot carve like ground), AIR_BRAKE 0.4 (a released jump keeps ~67% of
its speed after 1s — the arc finally carries). The blend clamps at 1 so a dt spike degrades exactly to the
old behaviour; the slide still writes velocity directly (authored decay) and the model bleeds its exit speed
smoothly. `test-1171` simulates all of it frame-by-frame. Note: a test comparing an early-time ratio must
measure DURING the build-up — by 0.5s the ground turn has saturated and the ratio measures only the shared
target (the first draft made exactly that mistake).

**THIRD CONTAINER ROLLBACK, and the first that bit mid-build.** After 1170's push the tree reverted to
mid-1164 state; the 1171 edits were unknowingly applied to that stale base (the anchors existed in both
states), and the tell was the suite reporting 906 harnesses with 1164-era failures — FEWER harnesses than
the previous run is the rollback signature; check `git log` FIRST. Recovery unchanged: copy new files
aside, `git fetch` + `reset --hard FETCH_HEAD`, re-apply from the scripted edit (which made it free).

## Props gain a runtime lifecycle (build 1170)

The feature audit's single biggest expressiveness gap: no verb could touch a PROP at runtime — the ball in a
sports level could not be reset, a bridge could not drop. Four verbs by tag (`showprop/hideprop/moveprop/
delprop`), host-authoritative, mirrored to clients over the existing `wact` channel, offered by the Do node
(tag field + place field extended). Four decisions worth keeping:
- **hide is intangible too** — collider out of the list, a dynamic prop's body removed and remembered
  (`_pvWasDyn`); an invisible wall is worse than no verb. show reverses every part, idempotently.
- **move preserves height ABOVE GROUND** (crate on a ledge → valley floor lands ON the floor), and a dynamic
  prop's body is removed before and re-added after so physHome recaptures at the new home.
- **del rides `shatterProp`, deliberately not `removeProp`** — debris, the prop's own 'destroyed' signals,
  deploy-restore and net reconcile all inherited; removeProp would splice the prop out of propModels and the
  next SAVE would lose the creator's prop. A runtime verb must never edit the level.
- **deploy un-hides everything** (in resetDynamicProps): hide is MATCH state, not a level edit.
Three pins moved (1033, 1073, 1077 — the verb/tag/place field lists grew). Spawn-prop-by-prefab is the
deferred other half: it needs the prefab def + net id story, its own build.

## The logic graph learns arithmetic and its first question (build 1169) — PHASE 2 OPENS

The feature audit's two cheapest CRITICAL walls, closed with two nodes in the STATE palette:
- **Math** — `var = A op B` with + − × ÷ min max mod. A and B resolve as literals OR variable names via the
  same `_lgNum` rule Branch uses, so `coins = coins × 2` finally works. ÷0 and mod 0 yield 0, never NaN —
  one NaN would silently poison every later compare in the level. Modulo is the positive (counting) kind.
- **Read game stat** — the graph's first world-state QUERY: player HP/maxHP, ammo mag/reserve, score,
  credits, wave, enemies-alive (hp>0, hole-safe), seconds-elapsed (zeroed at `_lgRunT` each run) → a
  variable. Pulse-driven like every state node: wire off an interval to poll, or read at the decision.
  Host state, and the graph already runs host-authoritative, so nothing new crosses the wire.

The sanitizer needed no change (unknown types pass through inert), autocomplete learned both nodes'
variable names, and test-1028's palette↔runtime parity list gained the two types — the parity it exists to
hold. `test-1169` drives the REAL `_lgPulse` switch for every operator, both poison guards, self-reference,
and all nine stats.

## Frame-loop allocation hygiene (build 1168)

The perf critic's measured residue, all hoisted to module scratch (the codebase's own _lp/_pcV pattern):
movement basis + wish (3 vectors/frame) and the stick-input clones; the editor-fly basis; the ledge grab's
full-subtree `Box3().setFromObject(avatar)` (ran every airborne-forward frame — now a 1x/s cached height
with the same 1.1–3 sanity band); `allPlayers()` (fresh array + 2 closures per entry per frame — now cached
per frame keyed on `_frameNo`, which loop() bumps, so joins are stale for at most one frame);
`_aoHideNoDepth` (array + closure per OBJECT across 2 scenes per frame — now an allocation-free walk with
the identical predicate); and `surfaceTopUnder`'s `dynamicProps.filter()` per query while holding a prop
(now one reused module array). Behaviour pinned identical; three pins moved (1084, 1158, 966), each keeping
its assertion's intent. NOT done (bigger than hygiene): pooling spark velocity V3s (they outlive frames),
and replacing _aoHideNoDepth's traverse with a transparent-material registry.

One self-inflicted lesson repeated: an inline `//` comment appended to a REPLACEMENT that lands mid-line
comments out the rest of the original line (the surfaceTopUnder edit swallowed its own raycast). The
syntax check caught it; use /* */ or place comments on their own line when patching mid-line.

## Asset failures are visible (build 1167)

The commonest creator failure — a model url that 404s or CORS-fails — was a console.warn plus a silent null
hole in propModels; without devtools the conclusion was "the engine ate my prop". `_noteAssetFailure` records
failures (deduped by url with a repeat count, capped at 40), `levelIssues()` LEADS with them (url tail shown —
Poly Pizza urls only differ there), a later successful load for the same url heals the entry, and the report
clears on restoreLevel/wipe because stale failures about a previous level are their own kind of lie. A
failure landing while the editor is open refreshes the panel live.

## The credits screen exists (build 1166)

"Asset licensing + a credits screen are release blockers" has been in this file for hundreds of builds.
Attribution lived in two systems that never met: per-prop `userData.attribution` (placed CC-BY models) and
the `assetCredits` set (enemy/pickup/chest/coin/attachment models, sounds). A CC-BY licence is only satisfied
if the credit is REACHABLE at play time, so: `levelCreditsList()` merges both plus `ENGINE_CREDITS`
(three.js/Rapier/PeerJS/fflate), deduped and sorted; the pause menu carries **Asset credits** in every
session with no creator opt-in; entries render via `textContent` because attributions are untrusted level
data; and `levelIssues()` flags a `sketchfab:` prop with no recorded attribution as the licensing exposure
it is (models placed through the in-editor search always carry one — this catches hand-pasted urls).

## The level format version is finally read (build 1165)

`serializeLevel` has written `v:1` since the field existed and nothing ever inspected it — across ~1160
builds. The single-file GitHub-Pages model guarantees stale cached clients exist, so "new level opened in an
old engine" is a normal event, and it silently dropped whatever the old client didn't recognise. Now
`LEVEL_FORMAT_V` is a named constant, `serializeLevel` writes it, and `_levelFormatCheck` gates
`restoreLevel` BEFORE the teardown (a refusal must cost nothing): a newer `v` still loads — tolerance is the
right default — but warns loudly naming both versions and the fix (refresh the page); a newer `minV` is the
author's declaration that a partial read is load-bearing wrong and refuses cleanly. Bump `v` when the schema
changes shape; set `minV` only when an old client's partial read would corrupt rather than degrade.

## The host bounds the claim — movement and damage rate (build 1164)

The panel's two netcode CRITICALs, both verified at the exact lines. Build 1130 established "bound the
claim" for damage MAGNITUDE and identity; this extends it to the two surfaces it never covered:
- **Movement.** `setRemoteState` wrote a client's reported position verbatim — teleport/noclip/speedhack
  were one console line, propagated to every peer as truth. Now `_plausibleMove` (host only; clients keep
  trusting the host's relays) caps per-tick displacement at 40 u/s (90 in a car), with ONE oversized jump
  allowed per 3s window — that is the legitimate-teleport allowance (respawn, the teleport verb, a jump
  pad's first frame). A speedhack is continuous, so it spends the allowance instantly and rubber-bands
  along its own claimed direction; a real respawn is rare and passes untouched.
- **Damage rate.** `_netDmg` caps one packet, so 50 capped pvpHits per frame was an instakill through
  walls. `_netDmgBudget` is a leaky bucket per SOURCE per KIND (pvp 500/s, pve 1500/s — generous multiples
  of the best legitimate output: SMG headshot spray ≈290/s single-target, splash across a crowd multiplies
  the PvE figure). Per-kind so melting a wave never crowds out PvP claims; per-source so one cheater's
  bucket cannot tax an innocent player. test-1164 proves 50 sniper-cap packets land exactly the 1s budget
  and a full second of the fastest legitimate spray passes 100% intact.

Four pins moved (1122, 1130, 389, 459) — each asserts the same intent through the new wrapped call; 1122's
harness injects the budget as pass-through because that test is about ROUTING, not the clamp.

## Undo keeps the selection; hide/lock become undoable (build 1163)

Two panel findings, both verified. restoreLevel ends with `selProps.length = 0` — right for a level load,
wrong for undo/redo which run through the same path: every Ctrl+Z threw the selection away. performUndo/
performRedo now record the selected NIDs (stable serialized identity) before the restore and reselect after,
with a 350ms second pass because models respawn async — primitives reselect instantly, imports as they land,
and a prop the undone edit deleted is simply not found. And the outliner's hide/lock buttons mutate
SERIALIZED state (e.eh/e.elk) with no snapshot — now one `pushUndoSnapshot()` per GESTURE (row buttons and
folder-wide toggles alike; the setters stay snapshot-free so callers own granularity).

## Duplicate keeps the configuration (build 1162)

The editor panel's worst trust-breaker, verified then fixed: both duplicate paths (toolbar + Alt-drag)
spawned only src/transform/dynamic/material — signals, tag, name, interact, locks, dialogue, NPC name, xa
animation, joints and vehicle tuning silently dropped. The correct pair has existed since build 1030:
`_pfEntryOf` (full propEntry config, identity stripped) + `_pfSpawnEntry` (the apply block the level loader
mirrors). `_dupSpawnFrom` now routes both paths through it — so when entry fields grow, duplicate inherits
them instead of drifting again. Group duplication still remaps to ONE fresh gid. `test-332`'s two pins moved
with it (same intent: zero-offset clone, material kept — now proven via the entry path).

## Weapon feel: dt, movement cost, and a round cone (build 1161)

Three panel findings, each verified then fixed in one scoped build:
- `recoil *= 0.85` was PER FRAME — 144Hz recovered ~2.4x faster than 60fps, phones wallowed. Now
  `Math.pow(0.85, dt*60)` (and the muzzle flash the same), so one second of decay is identical at any
  framerate and exactly equals the 60fps value the guns were tuned at.
- Movement cost the player NOTHING — bots have paid a run-and-gun penalty since 933; the player never did.
  The load-bearing part is the additive airborne floor (0.030, ADS-mitigated x0.4): rifle and sniper have
  spread 0.0 and a multiplier of zero is zero, so a scale-only penalty would have left sprint-jump-sniping
  pixel-accurate. Standing-still values are byte-identical to the old tuning — nothing authored moved.
- Pellets sampled (rand-.5, rand-.5) — a SQUARE, corner pellets √2 wider than edge. Now angle+sqrt-radius
  over a disc, max deviation preserved (0.5*spread) so tuned reach is unchanged; ~21% of old pellets fell
  outside the intended circle.

## Jump learns what slide already knew (build 1160)

The gate was `_jPressed && player.onGround` on the EXACT frame. Build 926 documented this precise failure for
slide — "onGround flickers mid-stride... ate ~half of all slides" — and buffered it; jump never got the same
fix, so a press one frame after walking off a ledge (or one frame before landing) was eaten. Now: a 0.10s
coyote window refreshed while grounded, a 0.15s press buffer, jump fires when they overlap, and BOTH windows
are consumed on fire (plus `JUMP_CD`) so coyote can never grant a second jump mid-air. `test-1160` replays
the window logic frame-by-frame: coyote catch, buffered landing, no double jump, both expiries, cooldown.
Five pins moved (160, 360, 392, 493, 89), each keeping its lock (loader, warmup, ledge, slide-cancel).

## The review panel, and its first confirmed kill (build 1159)

Six independent harsh-critic reviews (rendering, editor UX, gameplay feel, performance, feature surface,
multiplayer/platform) were run against build 1158 and merged into `scratchpad/critics/ROADMAP.md`. Rule for
consuming them: **every claim is a hypothesis until verified** — one CRITICAL died on verification already
(the "zero raycast acceleration" performance claim; the hand-rolled BVH from build 1097 was invisible to a
grep for the popular library's name).

Build 1159 is the panel's first verified kill: `updateEnemyShots` tested each collider's OVERALL box while
every other consumer moved to build 1148's per-part `boxes`. An imported building's overall box encloses its
doorways and interior, so an enemy inside had its bolt die on frame 1 — enemies in buildings visibly fired
and never landed a hit. The player's shots raycast real triangles, which is why it read as "enemies are
harmless indoors" rather than "collision is broken". Fixed with the same coarse-reject-then-parts shape the
enemy resolve uses; `test-1159` replays the doorway.

## Two fixes that were applied to the wrong half (build 1158)

Both of these were reported as "still broken" after a build that had claimed them. Neither earlier fix was
wrong; each was **complete for the half of the problem it was tested against**, and that is the pattern worth
carrying: a rule stated in one place and applied in one place is not the same as a rule.

**1. The sprite's drop shadow, third time.** Build 1152 established the rule — nothing that fails to write
depth belongs in a depth-derived G-buffer — and swept `scn`. But the muzzle flash a player sees on almost
every trigger pull is `playFlipbook('muzzle', ..., vmMuzzle)`: a Sprite inside the **viewmodel scene**, which
build 1140 renders into that same `_aoGeoRT` through its own `renderer.render(vmScene, vmCam)`. So the world
explosions were fixed and the commonest sprite in the game was not, which is exactly what "still there" meant.
The sweep is now `_aoHideNoDepth(root, out)` and **both** callers use it. 1126 named the sky dome, 1128 named
the weather points, 1152 replaced naming with a rule and left it inline in one caller; the only way back to
this bug now is to add a third render into the G-buffer without calling the function.

**2. Enemies on ramps.** Build 1154 fixed the movement RADIUS — real, and measured — but the thing actually
stopping them was vertical. Builds 1092/1094 gated the ramp exemption on `b.max.y - feetY < STEP + 0.5`:
**a statement about the bounding box, not about the surface.** A ramp primitive is one mesh, so
`refreshPropCollider` gives it ONE box spanning floor to summit. Standing at the foot of a 2.4 m ramp that
difference is 2.4, the gate fails, the raycast never runs, and the enemy is pushed away from the ramp it is
trying to climb. It could only ever get on near the top, where the box top finally came within 1.1 m of its
feet.

`clearAt` has asked the right question since long before: `propSurfaceAt(c, cx, cz)` — **this collider's own
surface at the contact point** — walkable if within a step, or a genuinely sloped surface within `RAMP_RISE`.
A flat-topped wall fails both (its top is out of reach, or has no slope), so nothing becomes walk-through.
Build 1154 made an enemy fit wherever the player fits horizontally; this is the same rule vertically.

Measured by replaying the real obstacle pass over a real wedge with a real raycaster — 4 seconds of walking
straight at each obstacle at chase speed, reporting the highest ground reached:

```
                              OLD gate              NEW (clearAt's question)
ramp, 4x8, rises to 2.40   climbed 0.00 (z -0.70)   climbed 2.39 (z 25.5)
wall, 3.0 tall             climbed 0.00 (z -0.95)   climbed 0.00 (z -0.95)
ledge, 1.2 flat-topped     climbed 0.00 (z -2.70)   climbed 0.00 (z -2.70)
kerb, 0.4 tall             climbed 0.40 (walked over)  unchanged
```

**0.00 metres, forever** — that is the whole bug, and the wall and the flat ledge stop an enemy at a
byte-identical position, which is the evidence that relaxing the test cost nothing. `tests/test-1158` is the
durable version of that probe (it builds the geometry and drives both predicates), and `scratchpad/rampstuck.mjs`
is the ad-hoc one.

**Four pins moved with it — 1092, 1094, 1152, 1154 — and every one kept its assertion's intent.** 1094 is worth
reading: what that build established (never sample on the box boundary, and never at a merged box's centre,
because either mistakes a ramp mouth for a wall) is *still true and still pinned*; only the gate around it
changed.

## A GLB's own lights arrived raw (build 1157)

Build 1153 recorded this as open work — *"imported models' own lights are unhandled everywhere else. Only the
loot box is fixed, because that is the one that spawns mid-match"* — and framed it as needing a decision about
creators who legitimately ship a lamp model with a light in it. Reading GLTFLoader settles the framing: the
freeze was never the worst of it. Three things arrive raw, and each is a defect on its own.

```js
const range = lightDef.range !== undefined ? lightDef.range : 0;   // 0 is INFINITE in three
lightNode.distance = range;
if ( lightDef.intensity !== undefined ) lightNode.intensity = lightDef.intensity;   // glTF states CANDELA
```

- **Intensity is in candela.** Blender writes the hundreds or thousands. This engine's own decorative point
  lights sit at 2–8 and its SUN is 1.5, so one imported lamp is two to three orders of magnitude past the key
  light — build 1142's fault, arriving through the front door.
- **`range` is optional and defaults to 0**, which three reads as infinite. A lamp in a corner lights the whole
  level, through walls.
- **Nothing bounded the count.** Forty emitters in a chandelier GLB is forty entries in `NUM_POINT_LIGHTS`,
  looped per pixel by every material in the level.

So they are **adopted, not stripped** — a creator who ships a light means it. `adoptModelLights` scales the
whole model's set by ONE factor so the brightest lands at `MODEL_LIGHT_TARGET` (5.0) and the author's relative
intent between two lights in one model survives; gives a light with no stated range a reach derived from the
model's own bounding box (a GLB arrives in whatever units its author used, so a fixed metre figure is wrong on
one asset and absurd on the next); keeps the `MODEL_LIGHT_MAX` (4) brightest and removes the rest from the
graph rather than hiding them (build 977); forces `castShadow=false`; and registers each with build 811's
existing `emitterLights` budget so distance culls them like every other emitter. `finalizeProp` is the single
chokepoint every imported prop passes through.

**The normalisation must run exactly once, and a prop can leave and re-enter the scene.** `shatterProp` hands
the lights back to the budget and `restoreDestroyedProps` re-adopts them, so `adoptModelLights` is idempotent
via the remembered `userData.modelLights` — re-scaling on the way back would darken a lamp every time it was
destroyed. The loot box is deliberately NOT routed through this: it has a pooled beam and 1153 strips its
model's lights, and two glows on one crate is one too many.

## The horizon had two different grounds (build 1156)

The stock level — the first frame anybody who opens the game ever sees — read as monochrome teal. Measured at
the real spawn pose: **63.7% of the lower frame had blue as its largest channel**, against 22.1% red.

It was not the grade, the sky or the lights. `DEFAULT_WORLD.skyGround` (the dome's own ground band) is
`0x6b6660`, **warm**, linear B/R 0.80 — while the ground plane it abuts at the horizon was `0x4f5d66`, blue at
B/R 1.70, and it is the largest surface in the frame. Two different grounds either side of one horizon.

That is precisely what build 1143 fixed for GENERATED levels and 1151 made derivable: `groundMood` names the
ground albedo once and hands the same value to the bake, the dome's band and the engine plane. **`DEFAULT_WORLD`
was never run through it.** So `floorColor` is now skyGround's HUE at the floor's OWN luminance —
`0x5f5a55`, linear Y 0.1045, unchanged to four decimals. Holding the luminance is the whole reason this is a
one-line change rather than a re-tune: the grade, the exposure and build 1149's bounce term are all tuned
against it. `test-1156` pins the LINK, not the hex, so retuning the dome without the plane fails there.

Measured headless at the spawn pose, **control pair first** — two runs of the unchanged build agreed to 0.1 of
a percentage point on every figure, so everything below is far outside run-to-run spread:

```
                 frame mean     distant architecture     lower frame: B is the largest channel
before          111,128,138       103,121,128 (B>G>R)         63.7%   (reddest 22.1%)
floor warmed    114,128,135       114,119,117 (neutral)       46.6%   (reddest 33.5%)
+ wall too      115,128,134       115,119,116                 41.5%   (reddest 39.4%)
```

**The wall change was measured and NOT shipped.** `groundMood` also derives the boundary walls (the same albedo
at 55%), but applying that here would halve this level's wall luminance — a different change from the one being
made — and warming the wall at its own luminance instead buys 5 percentage points while spending the
cool-distance note that a warm ground reads against. Recorded so it is not re-derived.

**Two things in the open-work list were wrong and are now settled by the same capture:**
- *"A hard horizontal SEAM runs across the middle of the frame where the teal floor plane meets an olive
  band."* The largest row-to-row jump in the frame is at y=337 with a magnitude of 333 — that is the **horizon**
  (sky 191,199,208 above, ground 75,90,98 below), which is supposed to be there. The largest jump BELOW it is
  105 at y=498 and it is a **luminance** edge — a raised platform's shadowed face — whose magnitude this build
  does not change (105.5 → 103.9) and should not. What DID change is its character: the surface above it went
  `75,106,111` (B highest) to `90,104,96` (neutral), so it is now a light/dark step rather than a teal-to-olive
  hue break. There is no hue seam to fix.
- *Build 1136's recipe, "warm the architecture and keep the props cool", is backwards for this level.* The
  probe says the architecture ALREADY reads warm (albedo 0.042/0.036/0.028, R>G>B) and it is the engine's
  ground plane that was cool — and brighter than everything standing on it. The ground was the term to move.

**And the pose is the finding, not a detail.** The first capture of this build was taken at a camera I picked
(0, 1.7, 14) and nine of its ten probe points hit `src=wedge` — a ramp 4.85 m in front of the player. At that
pose the frame measured 52.4% RED-dominant and the conclusion would have been "there is no teal problem". The
spawn is `(0, 2.9, 30)`. `stock.mjs` therefore defaults to **no pose at all**: it captures where the game
actually puts you, and `POSE=` env overrides only when a specific vantage is the question. Build 1124 said know
where the camera is; the corollary is that for "what does a new player see", the only valid camera is the
game's own.

## The fourth light, and the guard that names the fifth (build 1155)

Build 1153 fixed the loot box and wrote down the rule. **The same fault was live one screen away**, on the
commonest action in the game: `buildPropFireGroup` did `new THREE.PointLight(...)` + `grp.add(light)` +
`scene.add(grp)` the moment a prop caught fire, and the way a prop catches fire is
`damageProp → igniteProp` on a fused explosive — *shooting a barrel*, mid-match, in combat. Shattering it took
the light back out and recompiled again. Fixed the same way: `_fireLightPool`, seated at deploy, claimed and
released, unparented and aimed in world space by `_animateFire`, with `_reconcileFireLights` so no removal path
can strand a beam.

Two things are different from the chest pool and both are deliberate:
- **No floor on the pool size.** `min(FIRE_LIGHT_MAX, burnablePropCount())`, and burnable means
  `onFire || (explosive && fireFuse > 0)` — the two conditions `igniteProp` is reachable from. Every seated
  point light sits in `NUM_POINT_LIGHTS` and is looped over per pixel by every material whether or not anything
  has claimed it, so a level with no fire must pay nothing. The chest pool's floor of 4 is right for *it*
  (crates spawn randomly, so a level with no loot spots can still get one); nothing spawns a fire.
- **The editor seats the pool itself.** Authoring is not play: a creator who has just placed a barrel needs its
  glow now, and growing the pool there costs an editor hitch instead of a mid-match freeze.

Fire ZONES are untouched, and that is a judgement not an oversight: `refreshFireZones` disposes N lights and
builds N synchronously, so the count at the next render is unchanged — no recompile. Only the per-prop fire was
a genuine mid-match add.

**Four builds have now shipped this fault** — 636 (the first explosion), 977 (the first flashlight toggle),
1153 (the first loot box), 1155 (the first barrel). Every one arrived as a player reporting a multi-second
freeze, and every one was then found by *guessing* which subsystem had made a light. So this build also adds the
standing guard, `_hitchLightWatch`:

- **It costs nothing in a normal frame.** A recompile of every material in a level is a 1–3 second frame, so it
  only looks past `HITCH_MS` (220) — and only during play, because authoring legitimately moves the count.
- **The baseline is taken at DEPLOY**, after every pool is seated, so even the very first offending frame has
  something to compare against. Sampling only on hitches would have had nothing to compare on the first one.
- **`traverseVisible`, not `traverse`.** Three's `projectObject` skips an invisible subtree entirely, so an
  invisible light is not counted — which is exactly build 977's trap, and a plain traverse would be blind to it.
- It warns with the delta, the per-type breakdown and the names of the three pools, then stops after three.

**`test-01-syntax` had never parsed the one `type="module"` block.** `vm.SourceTextModule` needs
`--experimental-vm-modules`, which `run-all` does not pass, so the harness reported a failure whose message was
about the instrument (`is not a constructor`) rather than the source — and the Rapier loader went unchecked. It
now rewrites top-level `import`/`export`/`import.meta` out of the body and parses it as an async function body,
with a check that a deliberately broken body still fails, so the rewrite cannot swallow a real error.

## An enemy must fit wherever the player fits (build 1154)

Reported from play with a screenshot: enemies could not get up the default level's ramps or around its
boxes, and were clipping into one another — **"this was happening with the default capsule enemies as
well"**, using an imported model scaled to 0.38409. That last clause is what solved it: it ruled out the
model and pointed at a shared constant. Two numbers, neither about the GLB.

**1. The movement radius was bigger than the body — and bigger than the player.** The obstacle pass holds an
enemy `footprint` away from every collider box. The capsule's real radius is 0.7 (`CapsuleGeometry(0.7, 1.4,
...)`) but its footprint was `0.9*ty.scale`; an imported model's was `Math.max(0.9, realHalfWidth)`, so the
reported model — true half-width 0.365 — was held off obstacles by **2.5× its own width**. Both exceed the
PLAYER's `radius: 0.8`, which is the part that reads as "stuck": an enemy could not follow you through a gap
you had just walked through.

Replayed through the engine's own obstacle pass (`scratchpad/botstuck.mjs`) over a crate beside a ramp, a
1.2 m gap:

```
eR 0.9  PUSHED 0.50      eR 0.8  PUSHED 0.40      eR 0.5  PUSHED 0.10      eR 0.3  fits
```
Now `ENEMY_CAP_R = 0.7` for the capsule and the model's real half-width otherwise, floored at
`ENEMY_MIN_R = 0.3`. A genuinely wide model is still wider than the player — this is per-size, not a blanket
shrink.

**2. Separation lost a race it could not win.** Build 995 capped the anti-overlap push at `3.5*dt` because a
packed huddle applying full corrections every frame visibly vibrated. But 3.5 is **0.058 per frame** at
60fps, while a grunt CHASES at 6-9 u/s — 0.10 to 0.15 per frame each, so two enemies converging on the
player close at up to **0.2 per frame**. Steering out-ran separation by 3.4×, so enemies chasing the same
target sank into each other and stayed there. The cap now tracks the pair's own speed
(`max(3.5, speedA + speedB)`), giving 0.20-0.30 per frame.

Raising it cannot bring back build 995's vibration, and that is worth understanding rather than trusting:
`Math.min((minD-d)*0.5, cap*dt)` — the FIRST term is what prevents overshoot. The cap only limits speed. 995
fixed the vibration by adding the cap at a moment when the first term was doing the real work anyway; the
ceiling was never the stabiliser.

**Not the cause, and worth stating because it is the natural suspect:** the editor's *Collider radius* and
*Collider height* size the DAMAGE hit-cylinder only — the hint under them says so — so the reported 0.3 / 0
settings were correct and irrelevant. Height 0 means auto-fit.

Three pins moved with it, all preserving their intent rather than their literal: build 995's (the shove is
still a capped SLIDE, and 3.5 is still the floor for a standing huddle), and builds' 16 and 67 "footprint is
auto, decoupled from the collider radius" — still true, from a different constant.

## The fog learns altitude and where the sun is (build 1181)

Fog was one global `FogExp2` — a single colour at every height, blind to the sun. Overriding three's OWN
fog chunks (`fog_pars_vertex/fog_vertex/fog_pars_fragment/fog_fragment`) patches every built-in material in
one place: an exp height falloff (`fogHeight`, towers rise out of the fog, valleys pool — applied to the
OPTICAL DEPTH under exp2, so both fog models keep it) and a warm inscatter lobe looking down-sun (`fogSun`,
pow-8, colour `fogColor*[1.30,1.08,0.75]+[0.22,0.11,0.02]`). Raw ShaderMaterials (sky, water) untouched by
design. `renderScene` feeds `_sunDir()` NEGATED (it points sun→scene; inscatter wants toward the sun).

**The uniform plumbing was a silent no-op as first written, and the real three build said so before any
capture could.** The plan — "extend `UniformsLib.fog` with PLAIN-OBJECT values; `UniformsUtils.clone`
copies plain objects by reference, so every material's per-material clone shares them, one CPU write per
frame" — is true about clone (verified: Vector3 deep-clones, plain object rides by reference), but
**ShaderLib merged `UniformsLib.fog` at module load**, so a late add to the lib reaches NOTHING:
`initMaterial` clones `ShaderLib[id].uniforms` and `seqWithValue` silently DROPS any program uniform with
no value — both uniforms would sit at GL zero forever, which is exactly "falloff 0 + inscatter 0", a
perfectly plausible-looking frame. So the engine also walks `ShaderLib` and adds both uniforms to every
entry whose uniforms carry `fogColor`. The same pre-test run caught a second silent kill: **the sprite
vertex shader has no `transformed`** (no `begin_vertex`), so the shared `fog_vertex` would fail to compile
there and every fogged Sprite — the muzzle flash — would VANISH, build 1127's raw-shader trap. Sprites get
their fog include string-replaced to fog at their world ORIGIN. Instanced meshes apply `instanceMatrix`
inside the chunk (`project_vertex` folds it into `mvPosition`, never into `transformed`) or every batched
prop would fog at the batch origin. `test-1181` drives ALL of this against the real three build — the clone
semantics, the late-add-reaches-nothing fact, the sprite/begin_vertex facts — plus the executed maths
(optical-depth ratio equals the height term exactly; the mix saturates, so assert on depth, not the mix).

## The weapon came back to the editor (build 1264)

Reported from play: *"I can't see any weapons in the editor. When adjusting position for FPS, aim,
third-person weapon adjustment, it's impossible because no weapon is visible."* Build 1137 answered a
critic — the rifle covered a measured 11% of the AUTHORING viewport — with a blanket
`if(editorOpen) return false` in `_vmWanted`. Right about building, wrong about the three panels whose
entire job is posing the weapon: view framing, the ADS pose and the throw pose are all authored BY
EYE, against a weapon the author could no longer see. **A blanket rule was cheaper to write than the
distinction, and the distinction is what a creator needs.** The viewmodel now returns for exactly
`gun` / `aim` / `grenade` and stays hidden for every other kind of authoring, which preserves 1137's
real intent rather than reverting it. A non-first-person authoring camera still gets no viewmodel —
except on `aim`, which is precisely the pose a creator tunes when the level ships in another view.

**Two lists had to agree, and only one of them was wrong.** The editor camera has set
`gun.visible = (editorActive==='gun' || editorActive==='aim')` since build 151 — the engine already
knew which targets wanted the weapon. 1137 then stopped the PASS from running, so the mesh was
visible inside a pass that never drew: a visible object and an empty screen. Both lists now name the
same three targets, and `test-1264` asserts they agree, because either one alone is a silent no-op.

**Live-probed per target** (`vmWanted` / `gun.visible`): gun ✓✓, aim ✓✓, grenade ✓✓, props ✗✗,
lights ✗✗. Two pins moved (1137, 151).

**And I fell into my own build-1260 trap again in the probe** — nested template interpolation set
`editorActive` to the literal string `${tt}`, so the first run reported every target false and would
have sent me hunting a second bug that did not exist. Build the probe's source in Node and pass it as
one argument; it is now written down twice.

## The characters were never on the mover list (build 1263)

Reported from play within minutes of 1261 shipping: *"the character is running nicely, and the shadow
is super janky"* in third person. A regression I caused, and the mechanism is worth more than the fix.

`renderer.shadowMap.autoUpdate=false` means the map only re-renders when something calls
`_dirtyShadows`. Builds 807/808 built that mover list carefully — driven cars, coasting cars,
animated props mid-travel in the FAST tier; corpses and settling physics props every third frame —
and **never listed the player or the enemies.** Their shadows were current anyway, because
`_fitSunShadow` returned true on almost every moving frame and the loop calls `_dirtyShadows(1)` when
it does. The camera-fit was doing the caster refresh as a SIDE EFFECT, and nothing said so.

Build 1261 cut the refit to 19–31% of moving frames — correctly, for the volume — and the character's
shadow fell to that rate while the character itself moved at 60fps. In first person you barely see
your own shadow; in third person it is the thing you are looking at.

The movers are now named honestly: a moving player (velocity sum over 0.05), any living enemy, and
any remote player in a session. All three are skinned meshes whose pose changes every frame, so they
belong in the FAST tier beside a driven car. A still player in a quiet scene still costs nothing,
which is the case the static optimization was actually written for.

**The rule, which is the real output of this pair of builds: a perf change is allowed to remove work;
it is not allowed to remove work something else was silently relying on.** 1261 measured the thing it
changed (refit rate) and never asked what else consumed it. The measurement was right and the
conclusion was too broad — and the honest accounting is that 1261's win now applies to quiet scenes
rather than to active gameplay, where the map must refresh every frame regardless, because that is
what a dynamic shadow costs. The deadband stays: it was always right about the VOLUME.

## "Static" shadows were redrawing every moving frame (build 1261)

The audit's #3 performance finding, reproduced exactly: `renderer.shadowMap.autoUpdate=false` (7024)
bought nothing while the player was moving. `_fitSunShadow` snaps the focus to the shadow map's texel
grid, so ANY change is at least a full texel — which made the old `> texel*0.5` test true whenever
the snap moved at all. Measured by driving the real function over a 600-frame walk: **both cascades
redrew the entire caster set on 100% of moving frames.** The tiered mover-dirtying (33316) only ever
paid off standing still, which in an FPS is rare.

The fix is a DEADBAND, not a frame throttle, and the distinction is the whole design. A shadow map is
rendered from the LIGHT, so a stale fit does not lag the shadows of STATIC geometry at all — it only
leaves the covered REGION slightly behind where it would ideally sit. **That sentence was published
one clause too broad and build 1263 pays for it: the refit was also, silently, the thing refreshing
the map for MOVING CASTERS. See "The characters were never on the mover list".** And because the test is a DISTANCE, it is
self-limiting: a car crosses it sooner than a walker and refits proportionally more often, so
staleness never grows with speed. A frame-count throttle would have had exactly the opposite property.

`SHADOW_REFIT_TEXELS = 8`, chosen from a measured sweep rather than picked (the sweep is in the
source comment and `test-1261` reproduces it):

```
texels   walk 0.10   run 0.16   car 0.60   slack@E60
  0.5       100%       100%       100%        3cm     <- the old rule
    4        34%        50%       100%       23cm
    8        19%        31%       100%       47cm     <- shipped: 3-5x fewer redraws on foot
   12        13%        20%        50%       70cm
```

Slack scales with the texel, which scales with `shadowDist`, so it is always ~0.4% of the volume at
any setting — and the volume's trailing edge already sits 0.45*E (27 m at the default) behind the eye.
Lower quality rungs double the deadband: the machines that most need the draw calls back are the ones
least able to see the difference. Build 1120's texel snap is untouched — it is precisely what makes a
deadband safe, since without it the map would slide sub-texel every frame anyway.

**My first guess was wrong and the measurement said so.** I picked 4 texels expecting a 2.5x cut;
it measured 2.0x at a run, and the staleness bound I asserted (20 cm) was also wrong (23 cm). The
sweep then showed 8 was the honest choice. Two pins moved (1120, 1185) — both rigs execute
`_fitSunShadow` in isolation and it gained a constant, now supplied via `extractConst` so they test
the shipped value rather than a copy.

## HUD art (build 1260)

Widgets could show numbers (1058) and take a click (1255) but never show a PICTURE, so every
authored interface was engine-coloured text on the engine's own plate — no card faces, no portraits,
no panel frames, no title art. This is the audit's "HUD/UI authoring is variables-only" gap and the
second half of the card-game unlock. `img` is **one field with two roles, decided by the kind**: on
the new `image` kind it IS the widget, on every other kind it is the BACKGROUND — so a button becomes
a card face and a bar sits inside a frame. Plus `iw`/`ih` (an AUTHORED box, so nothing reflows when
the picture lands) and `alpha`.

**The url goes into CSS and level data is untrusted, so it is VALIDATED, not escaped.** `_hwSafeUrl`
requires an `http(s)` or `data:image` scheme and rejects any quote, paren, backslash, angle bracket or
whitespace — nothing can break out of `url("...")` or smuggle a scheme, and validation happens once at
SANITIZE time so the render path interpolates a string that is already known good. `test-1260` drives
it with eight injection shapes beside the legitimate ones. Worth knowing: a CSS image needs no CORS
header, unlike the texture fields next door — the editor hint says so, because the analogy would
otherwise mislead.

Two harness notes, both cost a cycle:
- **A literal quote inside a regex derails `extractFunction`.** `_hwSafeUrl`'s character class is
  written with `\u0022`/`\u0027` on purpose: with real quotes, extraction ran away by 125,000
  characters and two unrelated harnesses died with `savedLevel is not defined`. The file already
  favours `\uXXXX` escapes (307 of them) — this is why.
- **A probe that builds its own source with nested template interpolation will mangle it.** The first
  live run reported the art missing; the engine was fine and the probe had turned the url into the
  literal `${u}`. Building the probe string in Node and passing it as one argument fixed it. Verified
  after: a 220x140 image widget renders, and a card-face button fires the graph on a real mouse click
  ("PLAYED 1" counting up).

Three pins moved (1058, 1255 twice) — all rig plumbing for the sanitizer's new dependency, intent
unchanged.

## The graph reads the inventory (build 1259)

Dialogue could branch on what the player carries (`[if item:redKey >= 1]`) since build 1076; the
LOGIC GRAPH never could — `read` knew hp/ammo/score/credits/wave/enemies/time and nothing about the
inventory. So "the player is holding two fire cards" was expressible to an NPC and invisible to the
rules, while `give`/`take` had been verbs for builds — the graph could CHANGE the inventory it could
not READ. That asymmetry is the wall under every card, rune, ingredient and collection puzzle,
because such a puzzle IS a condition on what you hold.

Two stats, because they answer different questions and neither can express the other:
- **How many of an item** — `invCount(id)`, deliberately the same accessor dialogue conditions use,
  so the two surfaces can never disagree about what "holding" means. The item field carries
  `lgItemList`, so it offers the level's real ids.
- **Different items held** — non-empty stacks. "One of each of the four runes" cannot be written as
  a count of any single id.

An id that names no defined item reads 0 forever, which looks EXACTLY like "the player has none of
it" — the hardest class of bug to see. So a read with a blank or undefined id reports through
`_noteLogicFailure` (deduped, so a polled read reports once, not every pulse) and surfaces in Level
Check, the same courtesy tag verbs have had since 1214. The validation lives in the `read` case
rather than beside the tag checker, which has no node in scope.

**Design note, since this build exists to unlock card/puzzle mechanics.** Verified while scoping it:
an inventory item can already carry a **model, a tag and its own signals**, and `useType:'place'`
spawns it into the player's hands to drop — so a PHYSICAL card puzzle (cards as objects, plinths as
prop signals with `On object placed` + tag filter + contain + consume, `needs N` for combinations)
was fully authorable before this build. What was missing was the graph's ability to reason about a
HAND. With 1255's HUD button as the play surface and 1258's push as a world effect, the native design
for this engine is **cards as world verbs** — play a card, the room changes — rather than a 2D card
game the engine has no UI for. Remaining gaps for a true deck game: no image on a HUD widget (a hand
can only be text buttons) and no ordered collection type (draw works via Set-variable's random
min/max; shuffle/discard past ~6 cards is awkward).

## The graph gets force (build 1258)

The audit's gameplay gap #5: the graph could query the world and command enemies but had no way to
apply an IMPULSE — so a ball could be teleported to a goal and never kicked toward one, and a physics
puzzle could reset a crate but never nudge it. `moveprop` is a teleport; **`pushprop`** is a shove.
Four decisions:

- **Direction comes from the place field every other verb already uses.** Props are pushed AWAY from
  it: "away from `me`" clears a path, "away from `#here`" is a blast at the event's own spot, a tag
  is a fixed launcher. No place = straight up, which is the useful default. The direction is
  NORMALISED, so distance never changes the shove — 3 m and 300 m from the origin get the same push.
- **Strength is a VELOCITY CHANGE, not a raw impulse.** The impulse is multiplied by each prop's own
  mass, so "20" moves a crate and a barrel identically. Raw impulse would make every push a guessing
  game about the weight slider, which is the opposite of authorable.
- **An upward component rides along (0.4×)** so pushed props tumble and read as struck rather than
  sliding like ice.
- **No network message, deliberately.** The graph is host-authoritative and dynamic props already
  stream their motion to clients in the D snapshot, so the result arrives by the channel that carries
  every other physics event. The prop STATE verbs need `_wactSend` precisely because show/hide/move/
  destroy are *not* physics and the snapshot does not carry them — `test-1258` pins the absence so a
  future edit does not "helpfully" add one.

Guards that matter: the body is WOKEN first (a settled Rapier body swallows an impulse), a prop
sitting exactly on the origin gets a random horizontal direction instead of NaN, static and shattered
props are skipped, a blank tag pushes nothing rather than everything, and the amount clamps 0–100.
Four pins moved (1033, 1073, 1077, 1170) — all verb-list literals, intent unchanged.

## The light census, and a deploy cap (build 1257)

The audit's #1 PERFORMANCE ceiling, and it is structural rather than a bug — which is why it needed
naming rather than fixing. `updateLightBudget` (811) fades an emitter's INTENSITY past the nearest
16 (8 on phones), but by this engine's own hard rule (636/977/1153/1155) the light must STAY IN THE
SCENE, because removing it changes the light count and recompiles every material mid-match. r149's
forward renderer has no clustering: it compiles `NUM_POINT_LIGHTS = every light present` and every
fragment of every material loops over all of them, dimmed or not. So a creator who ticks "Light
emitter" on thirty props pays a 30-light loop per pixel forever, on the devices least able to afford
it — and nothing in the product ever said so. `_hitchLightWatch` (1155) only notices a CHANGE in the
count, never its absolute size.

Two answers, both cheap, because the expensive one (clustered/deferred lighting) is a renderer
rewrite:
- **Visible.** `_lightCensus()` counts by type over the visible graph; `_lightLoad()` is
  point + spot — deliberately NOT the directional/hemisphere pair, which is fixed at a handful and is
  not what content grows. Level Check warns past `LIGHT_SOFT_CAP` (40) and, unusually for that panel,
  says *why* it costs and what to do; shadow-casting lights get their own line (each is an extra
  render of the level whenever it moves). The perf HUD shows `lights N` beside draws and triangles.
- **Bounded.** `enforceEmitterCap()` runs at DEPLOY inside `preloadVfx`, beside the pools that are
  seated there and **before `warmFlipbookShaders` compiles against the count** — so the surplus is
  refused at the one moment a count change is already expected and free. 48 lights, 24 on phones.
  A refused light is REMOVED FROM THE GRAPH, not hidden (hiding still counts — 977's trap), the prop
  keeps its emissive glow (that is free), and the count is reported in Level Check rather than
  silently swallowed.

`test-1257` executes both: the census over a stub scene (types, totals, shadow casters, throw-safe
degradation) and the cap on both budgets — including that it is a complete no-op below the cap, so
ordinary levels are byte-identical.

## Draco models load (build 1256)

The inlined GLTFLoader has supported `KHR_draco_mesh_compression` since it was vendored — it throws
`'THREE.GLTFLoader: No DRACOLoader instance provided.'` — but nothing ever gave it one, so a
Draco-compressed .glb became a capsule plus a line in the asset-failure report. Sketchfab and most
"optimize my glTF" pipelines emit Draco by default, so this was a silent wall between a creator and
a large slice of the free-model web. Wired as the **third instance of builds 917/918's pattern**:
the failed load names the missing decoder, `_ensureDraco()` pulls it in on demand (memoised — one
download per session, shared by every later model, never disposed), and the load is re-queued. Nobody
pays the decoder's download until a model needs it. DRACOLoader imports `three`, so it comes from
esm.sh (the KTX2 constraint); the wasm/js decoder is a plain jsdelivr fetch, `preload()`-warmed so
the first Draco model does not pay the round trip mid-load. When the decoder genuinely cannot be
fetched, `_noteAssetFailure` rewrites the error into something a creator can act on ("re-export it
without Draco compression") instead of leaving an unexplained capsule.

**The audit was wrong about this one, and checking cost nothing.** The rendering critic reported the
decoder "already exists in the optimizer/repack path (15803–15818) — it just never reaches the game's
loader," which would have made this a two-line wiring job. Reading those lines: they are the meshopt
SIMPLIFIER (`S.simplify`), and `new DRACOLoader` appears nowhere in the file outside the vendored
library. The fix was the same size either way, but the note is the point — the panel's own rule
("every claim is a hypothesis until verified") applies to the panel.

**The load-bearing test is against the LIBRARY TEXT, not an assumption.** The retry fires on a regex
over GLTFLoader's error message; if an upgrade rewords it, the retry silently never fires and Draco
models quietly become capsules again with nothing failing. So `test-1256` extracts all three decoder
messages from the vendored source and drives the real error router with them — which immediately
caught that the three differ in SHAPE: KTX2 and meshopt name their **setter**
(`setKTX2Loader must be called…`), Draco names the **loader** (`No DRACOLoader instance provided.`).
The first draft of the test invented a symmetric KTX2 message and failed; the engine was right and
the test was wrong.

## The HUD becomes an interface (build 1255)

The audit's #1 gameplay gap: `_sanitizeHudWidgets` permitted `text | timer | bar`, display-only —
so no creator could author a shop, a quest log, an upgrade menu or a tycoon panel, and the only
purchase UI in the engine was the hardcoded loot-chest cache. A **`button`** widget fires a NAMED
LOGIC EVENT, and that is the whole feature: the graph already owns credits, inventory, spawning and
win conditions, so "buy the turret" is one button plus nodes a creator can already write. Three
things make it work rather than merely exist:

- **It reuses build 1071's `actEv` message for clients** — the host already clamps and routes it, so
  multiplayer buttons cost no new message type, no new handler, and inherit the existing validation.
- **A real `<button>` element** (focus and Enter/Space come free) that opts into `pointerEvents:auto`
  against the widget host's `pointer-events:none`, with the click stopped so it never reaches the
  world behind it.
- **A visible button releases the pointer**, exactly as `openInventory` does, and re-locks when the
  last one hides — a menu you cannot click is not a menu. `show when` gates the whole menu open and
  closed. Plus a 150 ms per-widget cooldown so a held mouse cannot flood the pulse budget.

A button's event name also joins `_lgEventOptions`, so the graph's **On event** dropdown offers what
you just authored.

**The live probe earned its keep, and the finding is the lesson.** `test-1255` passed with every
stub — and the button was INERT in the real game. `document.elementFromPoint` at the button's own
centre reported a **pause-menu label**, and the gates read `paused:true`. Releasing the pointer trips
the unlock handler's `openPause()`, so **making the button clickable was itself what made the game
reject the click** (it failed `_hwFire`'s own `paused` gate *and* was covered by the menu). The fix
is the mechanism the inventory already used: `_hwCursorFree` joins the handler's "a UI is
legitimately open" whitelist beside `chatOpen`/`mapOpen`/`invOpen`, and the flag is raised BEFORE the
release so the async `pointerlockchange` sees it. Three pins moved (192, 376, 60). Re-probed live:
two real mouse clicks → 100 credits, with the `{gold}` readout following. **Build 1244's rule, third
sighting: a unit test with stubbed dependencies proves the maths, never the mechanism — probe the
live path.**

## The remix trap is closed (build 1254)

The audit's #1 editor data-loss finding, replayed and killed. The gallery invites "open in editor to
remix", share links load straight over the working level, and there is ONE save slot — so opening
someone else's level and touching anything meant the 20-second autosave overwrote your only save
with THEIR level, silently, with an undo stack that dies with the tab. Now a level that arrives from
outside is **FOREIGN** (`markForeignLevel`): five entry points marked — `#lvl=` share links, `?game=`
URLs, the community gallery (Play AND Open in editor), file import (even your own backup — one Save
adopts it), and help-modal example projects. While foreign, EVERY automatic save path stands down:
the 20s timer, visibilitychange, before-play and on-close flushes all funnel through `autoSaveNow`'s
new gate, and the `beforeunload` direct-save gained its own `!_foreignLevel` term (two pins moved —
330 and 1083 — both keeping their flush-on-close intent). The autosave status line says what is
happening and why. An explicit **Save adopts** the level (`_ok && (_foreignLevel=false)` on the
button; Ctrl+S clicks the same button), and autosave resumes exactly.

The second half: a foreign load over UNSAVED work — the one state the save slot does not hold —
stashes the current level to a one-deep **rescue slot** (`breach_level_rescue_v1`, timestamped)
before it is replaced, with a toast naming where it went. The Save tab grows a **Restore backup**
row (hidden when the slot is empty, refreshed live via `_edRescueRefresh`): restoring pushes an undo
snapshot, loads the stash, marks it yours-and-unsaved so one Save commits it, and clears the slot.

`test-1254` executes the real `markForeignLevel` + `autoSaveNow` through the trap replay (dirty +
gallery + three autosave ticks → zero saves, stash intact), the clean-load case (no stash needed),
adoption, and native behaviour (byte-identical when nothing foreign happened) — and pins all five
entry points. Test-harness lesson recorded: returning `{ ...r }` from a rig SNAPSHOTS getters and
drops setters — assign extra keys onto the object instead.

## The audit, the reference, and the docs tell the truth (build 1253)

A nine-agent audit ran against build 1252 — six harsh critics (rendering, editor UX, gameplay
systems, multiplayer/platform, performance, content pipeline), each benchmarking against
Unreal/Unity/Godot/Roblox with the 1159 rule (every claim verified in source, citations required),
plus three inventory agents that catalogued every real control from the UI-builder code. Deliverables
now IN THE REPO (scratchpad gets wiped by rollbacks): **docs/AUDIT.md** (merged verdict + six full
reports + a consolidated quick-win list) and **docs/REFERENCE.md** (every setting/widget with ranges,
defaults and behavior — World & Scene, Objects/Tools/Editor incl. the full shortcut table, Game
Systems/Logic/Sharing incl. the complete node/verb tables and the wave-manifest grammar).

The merged verdict, one line per dimension: fair competitor on friction/rendering/systems-density;
the six ceilings are LOD/occlusion (rendering scale), no scripting escape hatch + one save slot
(editor), engine-owned PvP + no clickable UI + no world-state persistence (gameplay), no
identity/reporting + free third-party network infra (platform), unbounded light counts + a
too-high quality floor (performance), and docs frozen ~160 builds back (content).

Build 1253 fixes the audit's Gap 3 — the docs' three live factual errors: the in-game help claimed
"GitHub account needed" to publish (false since build 958) and never mentioned the instant /game/
publish (the least findable best feature — now surfaced in the same topic); the export button said
"Export .json" while writing `.rumpus` files the manual called `.breach` (three names, one file —
now "Export .rumpus" / "Import level"); breach-help.html still rendered the BREACH wordmark 300
builds after the rename (now RUMPUS ENGINE) and its `.breach` claims are corrected with the compat
promise kept explicit. A **What's-new section (builds 1090–1253)** was appended to the manual
covering every undocumented creator feature by task (editing faster / your own assets / looking
better / deeper rules / feel & combat / multiplayer & sharing). One pin moved (816 — the icon
assertion carried the old label). `test-1253` guards all of it, including that the false account
claim can never return.

## Per-emitter effect controls (build 1252)

Asked for from play the day 1250 shipped: Amount, Speed, Size, Spread, Height, Opacity, Saturation
and Color, per emitter, in an **Effect** section under the Tag row whenever the selected prop is an
fx_*. Overrides are MULTIPLIERS over the preset (never replacements — a preset retune still reaches
every emitter that hasn't overridden that knob), stored in `userData.fx.cfg`, serialized as `fxc`
through `propEntry` — the ONE serializer that saves, prefabs, duplicate, clipboard and net pAdd all
route through (1162's lesson, applied for once in advance) — and applied at all FOUR loader sites.
The editor writes cfg and calls `_fxReset` (tear down the Points + geometry; next tick rebuilds),
which is also how Amount changes the particle COUNT with no special path. Semantics worth keeping:
`_fxEff` returns the PRESET OBJECT ITSELF when no cfg exists (zero cost for untouched emitters);
Height means rise-rate for grounded plumes, region height for drifting volumes, and 1/gravity for
the fountain (same launch, higher arc), while Speed scales a jet's v AND g together so v²/g holds
and the arc keeps its exact shape at a faster tempo; the Color tint REPLACES the preset ramp (pick
red, get red — multiplying orange by blue gives black); Saturation lerps about luminance. Sliders
push undo on grab; Reset deletes cfg so the entry serializes nothing. `test-1252` executes the
sanitizer and derivation knob by knob; live-probed: an ember emitter with `{col:0x3388ff, amt:2}`
renders 128 particles reading 7,684 cool / 0 warm pixels against 1250's 1,022-warm baseline, and
`propEntry` round-trips the cfg.

## The third-person flashlight beams from the player (build 1251)

Reported from play: in third person the flashlight lit the scene FROM BEHIND the player. The light
has been parented to the CAMERA since build 672 — exactly right in first person, where the camera is
the eye, and wrong in every chase view, where the camera hangs metres behind the avatar.
`updateFlashlight()` re-homes it per frame: camera-parented at the original 977 offsets in first
person; scene-parented at the player's CHEST (pos.y − 0.35; pos.y is the eye), 0.4 m along their
facing, throwing 24 m, in any third-person view — so the beam starts in their hands, the avatar
stands behind the source, and a top-down twin-stick's beam sweeps with the cursor because yaw
already faces it. Re-parenting moves the SAME always-visible light within the graph — the light
count never changes (977's rule; the function is pinned to never create a light or touch
`.visible`) — and the parent guards make the steady state zero-work. Live-probed per 1244's rule
(unit stubs are not the mechanic): light 0.40 m from the player vs 4.58 m from the chase camera,
beam −23.5 m forward, and the FPS restore lands the exact `(0.18, −0.12, 0.1)` attachment.

## Ambient particle emitters (build 1250)

The engine had fire, weather, impact FX and flipbooks — all BAKED systems — and no way for a creator
to place dust motes, embers, steam, fireflies, a smoke column or a fountain. Every competitor ships
particles as a core authoring primitive. Six presets ship as **PROPS** (`fx_ember/dust/smoke/steam/
firefly/fountain` in `PRIMITIVE_BUILDERS`), which buys the entire editor by composition: gizmo
move/rotate/scale (scale IS the effect's size — point sizes multiply by it by hand, since
`gl_PointSize` ignores the transform), duplication, clipboard, prefabs, tags, serialization and net
sync with ZERO serializer changes — and the logic graph's `showprop`/`hideprop` verbs switch an
effect at runtime for free. An "Effects" row sits under Add a shape.

Load-bearing decisions:
- **The fire system's SHARED materials are reused** (`_getFireMat` additive / `_getFireMatSmoke`
  normal, per-particle size/colour/alpha attributes) — no new shader to silently fail (the twice-
  burned class), and the AO/velocity G-buffer sweeps already treat them correctly. Removal disposes
  the per-emitter GEOMETRY only, never the shared material.
- **No lights** (the 636/977/1153/1155 rule) and **no collision, via three surgical exemptions**:
  `refreshPropCollider` keeps the overall box for selection but empties `boxes`; emitters never join
  the `colliders` list (so no shot raycasts, no enemy avoidance — the 1236 ghost-wall class,
  prevented rather than filtered); `addStaticColliderFor` returns early (no Rapier body).
- **Particles simulate in LOCAL space** from closed-form parametrics (base + vel·t + ½g·t², sway
  sines) — a tilted fountain tilts, a carried emitter's plume rides along, and no per-particle
  position state exists to drift. Staggered ages, a single-hump sin^0.8 envelope (nothing pops in or
  out), dt clamped at 0.1 so a hitch cannot launch the field. The jet mode respawns on falling back
  to its pool.
- The wireframe selection marker is editor-only (`updateEmitters` owns its visibility per frame).

Verified two ways: `test-1250` executes the real seed/envelope/step (bounds over 200 seeds per
preset, respawn invariant, the jet splash floor, scale doubling point sizes) and pins the three
exemptions; captured headless with a control pair — embers 246 → 1,022 warm pixels (4.2x), the
fountain's spray visible arcing, and the in-page probe reporting `boxes:[0,0]`,
`inColliders:[false,false]`. One capture-harness lesson: the dead-CDN environment can raise the
level loader LATE (pending model loads), so a probe screenshot must wait on `!_levelLoaderActive`
or it photographs the cover.

## Shell-by-shell reload (build 1249)

The item 1172 deferred as its own build. The shotgun now loads shells ONE at a time (intro 260 ms —
the pump opens — then 420 ms per shell) on a chain of timeouts riding 1172's cancel token, so
switching still cancels cleanly, and **firing mid-reload cancels the rest of the chain and shoots
with what's in the tube** — the interrupt sits in `shoot()` BEFORE the `reloading` gate (it could
never fire after it) and requires `mag > 0`, so an empty tube still waits for its first shell. The
mag and reserve move one shell at a time, so a cancel never has a half-applied state to unwind:
every landed shell is kept, none vanish. The trade is stated honestly: a full 6-shell reload is
~2.9 s against the old flat 1.3 s, but a 2-shell top-off is under 1.2 s and you are never locked out
of the fight. The HUD counts the mag UP per shell — the flat path's `--` placeholder would hide
exactly the feedback shell loading exists to give (that line is now gated on `!w.shellReload`).
Each shell clicks (SFX.reload) and re-dips the gun (the reload anim retriggers). Flat-reload
weapons are byte-identical to 1172. `test-1249` runs the REAL `reload()`/`_shellNext()` under fake
timers: the full chain (one pending timer at a time, no orphans), the fire-cancel (scheduled timer
fires but the token makes it a no-op), reserve exhaustion, a partial top-off, both start guards,
and the flat fallback.

## Auto focus (build 1248)

The other half of the DoF play report ("can't ever quite get the settings to look right") was never
the blur — 1241 and 1247 fixed that — it was that **Focus distance is a number in metres aimed by
hand at a moving game**. `worldCfg.dofAuto` (opt-in, DEFAULT_WORLD false so no saved level changes
look): every 3rd frame a ray from the camera finds what the crosshair rests on — through
`_firstSolidHit`, because 1236's rule applies to focus too: an invisible surface must not pull the
lens — and `dofFocus` EASES toward it (`k = dt·6`, tau ~0.17 s: a rack, never a snap). A sky miss
racks out to 200 m. Living enemies join the target list (an aimed-at enemy holds focus); corpses do
not. Four gates, each deliberate: auto off, DoF off, **cutscene active** (updateCinematic's focusOn
rack writes dofFocus directly and `_cineReturn` restores it — the film language belongs to the shot),
and **editor open** (the sliders must mean what they say while dragging). Sanitize seeds the ease at
the authored focus so toggling never racks from a stale target, and the authored `worldCfg.dofFocus`
is never written — auto off returns exactly the saved look. `test-1248` executes the REAL tick in a
stubbed scope: convergence, the exact ease constant, the 3-frame throttle, the miss, both clamps,
the ghost filter, all four gates, and the corpse rule. No capture needed — this build is pure JS,
the class the Node harness fully covers.

## Real bokeh (build 1247)

Build 1241's notes named their own limit — "one gaussian family for near and far fields (no true
bokeh shape)" — and the play report behind it ("can't ever quite get the settings to look right")
was only half-fixed: the banding went, but a defocused highlight still faded into MIST. The blur's
first pass is now a 32-tap golden-angle (Vogel) DISC gather — `r = sqrt(i/N)`, `θ = i·2.39996` —
which is the uniform aperture integral a real lens performs, with a HIGHLIGHT weight per tap
(`1 + 5·max(0, lum−0.7)`, computed in linear before any encode) so a bright point dominates every
disc it falls inside: highlights bloom into bright circles. The second pass is no longer a V
gaussian (a disc needs no separable pair) but a 3×3 tent whose spread scales with the local CoC —
it fills the Vogel pattern's residual grain in defocused areas and cannot touch sharp pixels.

1241's guarantees survive, restated where they now live: every tap in BOTH passes still weighs by
its OWN CoC (the halo fix), the anti-banding guarantee moved from tap spacing to a hard 14-texel
radius cap (worst Vogel gap ≈ r·√(π/32) — covered by bilinear + the fill; test-1241's computed
section moved with it), and the 1115 encode invariant lives in the fill pass, the only one that
presents. The disc pass passes LINEAR through untouched — including its early-out, where the old
`_out()` was already an identity (uEncode is 0 on a non-presenting pass).

Measured on a defocused emissive (focus 2 m, strength 3.5, the pink pickup blob): profile FLATNESS —
area ≥70% of peak over area ≥25% of peak, the plateau-vs-peak discriminator — went 0.087 → 0.110
(+27%), base control pair agreeing to 1%. And a correction worth keeping: the first metric (bright-
pixel count) moved OPPOSITE the prediction (−11%) and was the metric's fault, not the shader's — a
flat disc spreads moderately-bright horizon light evenly where a gaussian centre-weights it, so
"more bright pixels" was never what a disc promises. What a disc promises is the plateau, and the
plateau is what measured. The cine preview window's own mini-DoF (`_renderPvDof`, build 614) still
uses its old kernel — a preview approximation, listed as open work.

## Per-object motion blur (build 1246)

Build 1238's notes named their own gap: rotation reprojection answers only "how did the CAMERA
turn" — a camera-locked viewmodel smeared with the world on every flick, a moving enemy never
streaked at all, and camera TRANSLATION (strafing past a wall) blurred nothing. The named fix was a
velocity buffer; this is it. Every mesh's world matrix is STASHED per frame; a half-res pass renders
the scene with `_matVel`, whose per-draw `uPrevM` is that mesh's last-frame matrix — set in
`onBeforeRender` + `uniformsNeedUpdate`, the mechanism three ships for exactly this — against the
camera's last-frame view-projection. The blur pass streaks along the buffer's true per-pixel
velocity and keeps 1238's rotation path VERBATIM as the fallback for unwritten pixels (the sky) and
for every rung below the top one, where the pass is shed. No new world field: `postMotion` simply
means more on the top rung.

Decisions that are each a bug if lost:
- **The hook is material-guarded and stale-guarded.** `onBeforeRender` fires on EVERY pass that
  draws the mesh (main, shadows, AO, velocity) — the first line returns unless the material is
  `_matVel`. And a stash older than exactly last frame (`_pvmF === _frameNo-1`) is IGNORED in favour
  of the current matrix: re-enabling the pass after a shed must not streak off week-old history.
  The camera VP has the same stamp (`_velVPF`). Meshes with their OWN hook (sky dome, flipbooks) are
  left untouched — they are swept from the pass anyway.
- **Encoded velocity, byte-target safe.** `rg = v*4+0.5` (±0.125 UV, ~1px quantisation on the
  UnsignedByte fallback, exact on half-float); the clear is `setClearColor(0x808080, 0)` so an
  unwritten pixel decodes to ZERO motion and fails the `a > 0.5` written-test — 1126's
  near-zero-alpha trap, dodged by construction. Clear colour saved and restored around the pass.
- **Skinning uses the CURRENT pose for both ends** (limbs inherit the body's velocity — the rigid
  approximation every shipping velocity buffer makes); **instancing applies `instanceMatrix`
  manually** (1181: `modelViewMatrix` never carries it), exact because batches are static.
- **The viewmodel renders its own velocities against static vmCam** — only the weapon's bob remains,
  so the weapon holds while the world streaks. Same hygiene envelope as the AO prepass (shadow
  refresh frozen, sky/weather/background out, `_aoHideNoDepth` on BOTH scenes — test-1158's call
  count moved 2 → 4, the rule satisfied twice more).

Measured headless with per-mode static references (single spinning frames are content-confounded —
the 1238 lesson): during a hard per-frame spin the weapon's sight-block retains **60.7%** of its
static p99 edge sharpness on the velocity path vs **30.1%** on the forced rotation fallback — 2× —
while the world's blur is mode-identical (ratio 1.005). The residual softening is the half-res
buffer's bilinear boundary mixing weapon and world velocity at the silhouette — the standard
gather-blur edge artifact, accepted.

**The capture's own trap, worth keeping: a wall-clock-driven spin measures NOTHING on a slow
renderer.** SwiftShader frames are long, so `setInterval` yaw accumulated past 1238's 0.35 rad/frame
CUT threshold and the cut guard zeroed blur in BOTH runs — a perfect null with every uniform
confirming "on". Drive test motion per-FRAME (`requestAnimationFrame`), and tap `uAmt` to prove the
cut guard is not what you are measuring.

## Screen-space reflections (build 1245)

Glossy floors, marched from the buffer the engine already had: the AO G-buffer carries view normal
(rgb) and linear view depth `-mvPosition.z` (a), which is everything a cheap SSR needs — so `_matSSR`
costs no new prepass. Half-res, 24 exponential steps (~55 units reach), scene colour from
`_postRT.texture` (LINEAR — the composite adds `sr.rgb * sr.a * uSSR` before its one encode, 1115's
rule; sampling the MSAA target resolves it, same as bloom). Four decisions worth keeping:

- **Floors only, by design.** The G-buffer has no per-pixel roughness, so a wall would mirror at full
  strength with no material to say otherwise. `smoothstep(0.55, 0.85, dot(n, uUpView))` — uUpView is
  world up in view space, read straight from column 1 of `matrixWorldInverse` (current, because the
  scene render just updated it; no per-frame quaternion allocations).
- **A sky pixel mid-march is stepped OVER (`continue`), not treated as a hit or a wall** — the
  geometric `_empty` test from 1126. Break on sky and a reflection dies at every silhouette edge.
- **The gates:** `_geoWant` gained `|| _postSSR > 0.001` so SSR keeps the PREPASS alive when AO is
  authored off — and `_aoWant` therefore gained its own `_ssaoAmt` term, or SSR would have switched
  the AO sample on. `_ssrWant` sheds on the first downshift like the AO sample. Both 1218 pins moved.
- **Authored:** `worldCfg.ssr` (0..1, DEFAULT_WORLD 0.35, slider beside the AO pair, `_postOffWorld`
  zeroes it). Composite binds `_bloomMips[1]` when the pass didn't run — 1242's bound-fallback rule.

Captured headless (adaptive off via `breach_adaptres`, grain/motion/autoExp zeroed for determinism):
control pair agrees to 0.26%; ssr 0→0.9 lifts the aimed-down floor +5.2% luminance and its unique
colours 3,764 → 7,737 — reflections carry CONTENT, not a flat lift; the frame shows the crates'
glossy copies under them. At the shipped 0.35: +2.9%, 6,051 — a subtle wet-floor sheen.

**The capture harness note that cost an hour: the dead Rapier CDNs HANG in the sandbox** (no
connection reset), so `__PHYSICS_READY` never settles and `GAME_START` never runs — the menu binds
nothing and #startBtn clicks do nothing, with no error anywhere. The probe copy now stubs
`window.__PHYSICS_READY = Promise.resolve(null)` outright. And the cheapest closure hook yet:
inject `window.__probe = function(__f){ return eval(__f); }` at `function startGame(){` — eval runs
in the game closure's scope at CALL time, so one hook reads and writes any internal from page JS.

## The mantle probe finally reaches the wall (build 1244)

"Ledge still acts EXACTLY the same with build 1243" — and *exactly the same* after a verified fix
means the fixed code never ran. Probed IN THE LIVE GAME headless (probe5: real KCC mover, boxes
spawned relative to the player's feet, synthesized W+Space input, a frame tap on the grab gate): the
gate entered, the player was airborne at grab heights, and **mantleLedge returned NULL on every frame
of every jump**. The single probe 0.55 ahead of the player's CENTRE never cleared the KCC capsule's
0.8 standoff — it sampled the open ground at the player's own feet, so no ledge ever grabbed through
this path, and 1239's pose fix plus 1243's window/ceiling fixes were all real fixes to code the
probe distance kept unreachable. (What the user HAD been seeing — including the knee-high hang —
came through this same gate only in the rare poses where momentum pressed the capsule deep enough;
the fixes never changed those poses' inputs, hence "exactly the same".)

The grab now SCANS outward to arm's reach — 0.45/0.7/0.95/1.2 — first grabbable top wins, and the
hang/pull anchor derives from the distance that actually found the ledge. Re-probed live on this
build: `hang → pull` chains recorded, the runner climbing 7.7 m of stock architecture with
consecutive pull-ups. `test-1244` replays the standoff geometry (old probe 0.25 short → null; scan
grabs at 0.95; far-from-wall still null) and pins the scan + anchor. One pin moved (493).

**The lesson for the whole session: three builds tuned a mechanic whose PROBE never touched the
target.** 1233's rule was "probe the scene before theorizing"; the sharper form is *probe the
MECHANIC's own inputs in the live game* — a unit test with stubbed dependencies (clearAt=()=>true,
geometry laid at the probe point) can pass forever while the live path dies one dependency earlier.
The headless input-driven repro (probe5) found in one run what three tuning builds could not.

## The mantle grabs the right ledges (build 1243)

The 1239 sink fixed the hang POSE; this fixes WHICH ledges hang, after a screenshot report showed
both remaining faults at once: a knee-high box triggering a full hang (the character kneeling ON the
box, hands gripping air) while a perfect chest-plus box beside a taller one refused to grab at all.
Two mechanisms:
- **`MANTLE_MIN` was `STEP + 0.05` = 0.65** — anything taller than an auto-step hung. A hang is for
  ledges ABOVE HEAD HEIGHT; below that you simply jump onto the box (the jump apex clears ~2.8 m).
  Now 1.55. With the ground clamp added to the hang height (`max(sunk formula, ground + EYE − 0.12)`),
  a ledge near the bottom of the window stands the body at the wall base with arms up instead of
  burying the feet — the sunk formula alone put feet ~0.5 under the floor on a 1.6 m ledge.
- **1233's bug class was alive in `mantleLedge`**: the UNCEILINGED `surfaceTopAt` read an ADJACENT
  TALLER box's top, so rise came back over `MANTLE_MAX` for the whole jump and the grabbable ledge
  was invisible. Both probes (the grab test and 966's wall-face scan) now ceiling at the reach
  window. `test-1243` drives the REAL mantleLedge over real boxes: a 2.4 m ledge grabs mid-jump
  despite a 5 m box directly behind it, with the unceilinged read proven to see the masker.

When 1233 fixed groundHeightAt it noted the fix pattern; this build is the audit it implied — grep
for remaining unceilinged `surfaceTopAt` callers whenever a "reads the wrong surface" report arrives.
Three pins moved (493, 966, 1239's own — window value, formula shape; intents kept).

## God rays (build 1242)

The rendering list's next item: screen-space light shafts — a 24-tap radial march of the bloom
pyramid's own quarter-res bright field (`_bloomMips[1]`, no extra bright pass) toward the sun's
projected screen position, added LINEAR in the composite before the one encode, tinted by the
authored sun colour. CPU side: the sun's screen position from `_sunDir()`, a facing ramp (a sun
behind the camera casts nothing), an edge fade so shafts dim as the sun leaves the frame instead of
popping, and the bottom adaptive rung sheds the pass. Authored as `worldCfg.postRays` (0..1,
DEFAULT_WORLD 0.45, slider in the post section, `_postOffWorld` zeroes it).

**Three capture rounds shaped it, and two would have shipped wrong without measuring:**
- Round 1 was a clean NULL — the debug tap showed the adaptive ladder sitting on SwiftShader's bottom
  rung: the shed-gate had turned the pass off. The gate working looked exactly like the shader
  failing; the probe distinguished them in one run.
- Round 2 measured a **+45% GLOBAL VEIL on far corners**: an open daytime sky clears the bloom
  threshold almost everywhere, so marching an unrestricted bright field gives every pixel light from
  every direction. Fix in the shader: each tap weighted by a sun-centred, aspect-corrected disc
  (`sw²`, normalised by the UNWEIGHTED sum so off-sun pixels darken to zero instead of renormalising
  the veil back in), decay tightened 0.94 → 0.90.
- Round 3 confirmed: **sun-side band +9.6%, opposite band +0.8%** — directional shafts, not a wash.
  (A first directionality metric compared bands on the wrong side of the frame — the aim-offset sign
  put the sun right, not left; recompute geometry before concluding.)

Two pins moved (1126, 880). Process note: this build's commit initially went out ON A BROKEN COMMAND
CHAIN — a failed `cd` skipped the test run, the full suite AND this entry, while the unchained
commit+push lines still fired. The suite was green when run immediately after (982/982) and this
entry landed in a follow-up commit, but the lesson stands: never let commit/push sit UNCHAINED after
verification steps in one shell command — one `&&` chain end to end, or separate tool calls.

## The DoF stops being blocky (build 1241)

Reported from play: *"super blocky and I can't ever quite get the settings to look right."* Two
structural shader faults, not a tuning problem: **the tap spacing scaled with the blur** — `step =
coc·6` texels with uStrength folded into coc (up to 4), so a strong blur spread 13 taps across as
much as ~140 texels: visibly repeated images, which is exactly "blocky" — and **every tap was weighed
by the centre pixel's blur alone**, so sharp in-focus edges smeared halos into the blurred field
behind them (why no setting ever felt right). Now: spacing hard-capped at 1.5 texels between taps —
the radius SATURATES (~12 texels/pass, the H and V passes compound) instead of ever banding, so no
Strength setting can break the image; 17 taps; each tap weighed by its OWN CoC (`0.25 + 0.75·cocAt`)
so in-focus neighbours mostly keep their colour to themselves; smoothstep CoC for a soft
focus-to-blur transition. The 1115 encode-once invariant is untouched on both the early-out and blur
paths. Honest limits: one gaussian family for near and far fields (no true bokeh shape), and maximum
blur is traded for guaranteed smoothness.

**Capture-verified** (raw ShaderMaterial — the mandatory-probe class): focus 4 m / range 3 /
strength 3 on the stock frame drops far-field gradient energy **36.0%** vs DoF off while luminance
holds within 1.8% — a silently-failed shader would have crashed the luminance control. Probe:
`probe3.html` / `runprobe3.mjs` per the 1237 recipe with a `window.__dof` hook.

## Weapons can be renamed (build 1240)

Asked from play: "add a sword/handheld weapon (axe, staff)… we have melee, so maybe the answer is
just the ability to rename weapons." It is — every display surface already reads `WEAPONS[k].name`
live (HUD, weapon wheel, kill feed, pickup labels, loadout picker, attachments header), so an
authored name renames the weapon EVERYWHERE, including the logic pickup-spawner's label. 1190's exact
pattern: `GUN_BASE_NAME` factory baseline captured at boot, `_wepApplyName` the one sanitizer (trim,
24-char cap, blank restores factory, key fallback), `nm` serialized only-when-changed so untouched
levels are byte-identical, BOTH loaders apply it with the no-entry branch restoring factory so a
renamed Fists in level A never leaks into level B. UI: a Name field atop the Kit panel's per-weapon
section (placeholder = the factory name, Default restores). Melee "sword" recipe: rename Fists,
give it a model, tune dmg/reach in the stat sheet. Three pins moved (476, 530, 229 — the serializer
gate + record shape grew nm; intents kept).

## The ledge hang sinks below the lip (build 1239)

Reported from play: the hang "positions the chest/belly at the edge, torso/arms/head way over the
top, clinging to thin air." Build 966's hang height puts the avatar's HEAD TOP exactly at the lip BY
CONSTRUCTION (`hy = lip + EYE − vh·1.02` — the vh term cancels), whatever the model's height. Right
for a body standing at a wall; wrong for a HANG, whose pose raises the arms ~0.4 above the head — so
the hands gripped air above the edge and half the body cleared the lip. `LEDGE_HANG_SINK = 0.42`
drops the whole hang: head top ~0.45 under the lip (raised hands land ON the edge), eyes ~0.45 under
it (first person looks at the wall face with the edge just above view centre — the standard framing).
The avatar-height sizing survives (a short model still hangs by its hands), the pull-up still ends
standing on top. Browser-verify the third-person look once; the geometry is test-computed.

## Real camera motion blur (build 1238) — the rendering deferred-list opens

Asked directly from play: "Did you implement actual motion blur yet or are we still faking it?" We
were faking it: `_matAfter` was `max(new, old*damp)` — a decaying AFTERIMAGE that ghost-trailed
everything equally and answered "did the camera move" with "did any pixel change". It is now a
**rotational reprojection blur**: each pixel's view ray is rotated into LAST frame's camera
orientation (`uMbRot = prevR^T * curR`) and reprojected, giving the true per-pixel screen velocity of
the camera's rotation — the dominant motion term in an FPS, and the one that is depth-independent
(the translation term needs per-pixel depth, which the MSAA target cannot carry — the AO-prepass
constraint — and is deliberately absent). Eight taps along the streak, 5%-of-screen cap, guarded
divide. The accumulation ping-pong and buffer swap are GONE (one pass instead of two + swap);
`postMotion` keeps its slider but now means blur strength, and 0 still skips everything.

Three correctness pieces in `_mbFrame` (a pure, tested core):
- **The cut guard**: >0.35 rad in one frame is a teleport/respawn/cinematic cut, not motion — that
  frame renders SHARP instead of smearing the whole screen once.
- **The shutter**: per-frame delta × `(1/60)/dt` clamped [0.5, 2.5] — at 144Hz the streak scales up
  to a 60Hz-equivalent exposure so the authored look holds at any refresh rate (1161's rule), and a
  hitch frame floors instead of exploding.
- **Known honest gap**: the viewmodel is camera-locked (true velocity ~0) yet lives in the frame, so
  a hard flick smears it with the world. The afterimage ghosted it identically — no regression — and
  the proper fix is a per-object velocity buffer, its own build.

**Capture-verified before shipping** (this is a raw ShaderMaterial — the twice-shipped silent-compile
class — so the harness run was mandatory): metric = horizontal/vertical gradient anisotropy of the
frame, 6 shots per condition, because raw gradient comparisons across a spinning camera are content
noise (the first metric produced a nonsense −18.7% and was thrown away — no control pair, the
documented trap). Spinning with blur on: anisotropy **−13.4%** vs the identical spin with blur off —
the directional smear is real. Still frames: **0.3%** delta on/off — the shader compiled and is inert
at zero delta. Probe: `mkprobe.py`/`runprobe2.mjs` pattern per build 1237's recipe. Three pins moved
(437×2 — the afterimage/swap pins became reprojection/no-ping-pong pins; intents kept).

## Decals ride the surface they hit (build 1237)

The floating-decals report survived 1236 ("still placing in mid-air — now when I shoot at the default
capsules"), so this time it was PROBED instead of theorised: an instrumented copy of breach.html
(spawnBulletDecal wrapped to log every world-decal recipient's full parent chain; an auto-runner that
aims at the nearest enemy and fires 60 shots), driven headless under the preinstalled Chromium. The
probe answered in one run: the decal recipients were REAL, VISIBLE meshes — and the first carried
`userData._cgMobile`. **Decals were stamped in world space (`scene.add`), and moving props were
catching them**: a hole stamped on an animated door, elevator or the stock level's own moving platform
hung in mid-air the moment the surface moved on — reading as "bullets hitting an invisible wall" when
the mover had already gone. 1236's ghost filter was right about its own class (undrawn surfaces) and
irrelevant to this one.

The fix: after the stamp, walk to the hit object's TOP-LEVEL root and `Object3D.attach` the decal —
attach keeps the world pose, so a wall decal is byte-identical (static roots don't move), a mover's
decal travels with it, and a deleted prop takes its holes along instead of leaving them floating. The
root, not the hit mesh: a multi-mesh prop moves as one object, and an InstancedMesh hit reports the
shared unit geometry (1139) whose root is the static batch — attach still lands world-true. Every
removal site (expiry, the DECAL_MAX cap, the level-load wipe) detaches from WHATEVER parent the decal
rides, so the pool can never leak a mesh into a prop. `test-1237` replays the sliding door on a real
THREE graph; two 1021 pins moved (the stub scene now tracks parentage; intents kept).

**The headless probe harness is rebuildable in minutes and worth rebuilding** (rollbacks wipe
scratchpad): copy breach.html, inject a recorder + auto-runner inside the game script (full closure
access — page-level JS can't reach GAME_START internals), serve it locally with `three.min.js`
FETCHED VIA CURL and served from the same origin (headless Chromium bypasses the agent proxy, so CDN
loads ERR_CONNECTION_RESET — Rapier may fail, the engine boots without physics), launch
`/opt/pw-browsers/chromium-1194/chrome-linux/chrome` via Playwright with swiftshader, click
`#startBtn`, poll `document.title` for the JSON payload. `waitUntil:'domcontentloaded'` — 'load'
never fires with dead CDNs.

## Nothing invisible stops a bullet (build 1236)

Reported from play with screenshots: *"some bullets hit an invisible wall and leave decals just
floating"* — body-height decal clusters hanging in a doorway. Two ways an undrawn surface is
raycastable, and combat rays were blind to both: a mesh whose MATERIAL is invisible
(`material.visible=false` / opacity ~0 — how asset packs ship collision volumes inside a GLB, and
exactly the trick the enemy hit proxies use on purpose), and a mesh under an invisible ANCESTOR
(the Raycaster honours a mesh's own `visible:false` but never its ancestors' — 1139's documented
trap; editor-helper children live under hidden groups). A pellet that hits one leaves a floating
decal on air; a rocket detonates mid-doorway.

`_shotGhost(o, hit)` + `_firstSolidHit(hits)`: combat rays skip any hit the renderer would not draw —
walking the ancestor chain, reading the HIT FACE's material slot on multi-material meshes (slot 0
alone would misjudge mixed meshes), treating opacity ≤ 0.02 as undrawn while real glass (0.3) still
stops a bullet — EXCEPT `isHitProxy`, which is invisible-and-shootable by design and checked FIRST so
an invisible material can never eat an enemy hit. Routed through the cursor-resolve ray (a ghost must
not become the aim point), every pellet, and the rocket sweep. Only-ghosts-on-the-ray is a clean miss
(tracer to the sky), never a floating decal. The 1152 rule, ballistics edition: nothing that does not
write depth belongs in a depth-derived buffer; nothing that is not drawn stops a shot. Four pins moved
(1109, 885, 328, and 1236's own during writing — each keeps its intent through the filtered forms).
Deliberately NOT applied to enemy-bolt box tests, the camera collider, or movement — those are
collision, not ballistics, and a creator's invisible wall may be a legitimate barrier there.

## A death animation finally plays (build 1235)

Reported from play with a screenshot of a corpse standing on its head: *"Enemies go stiff and bob up
and get stuck in the floor on death. They aren't playing their death animation."* All three symptoms
were one path: killEnemy's no-ragdoll branch spliced the mixer, had `_poseDeath` BAKE the die clip's
final frame in zero seconds, then stacked 994's generic 86° topple ON TOP — a clip that already lies
the body down ended ~180° over (the head-stand), and 1175's bbox solve measured the BIND pose
(`Box3.setFromObject` cannot see skinned deformation), placing a resting height for a pose the body
wasn't in: the bob, the burial. The machinery to do it right existed all along — the die-clip
taxonomy (`/die|death|dead|killed|defeat/i`), LoopOnce + clampWhenFinished, directional variants the
BOTS have played since 21719.

`_clipDeath(mesh, sx, sz)`: a model that ships a die-family clip now PLAYS it — mixer kept alive, no
quaternion, no height solve (the clip owns the pose), directional variant from the shot direction
(shot from the front falls backward — the bots' rule) — then lingers clamped on its last frame, sinks
and fades. Models WITHOUT a die clip keep 994/1175's topple byte-identically. Two traps in it, both
pinned: **the gate reads `acts.die/dieFront/dieBack` DIRECTLY** — `_stateActionKey` walks the fallback
chain and die's fallback is IDLE, so asking it "is there a die clip?" answers yes for any model that
can stand; and **`_removeFadeCorpse` releases the mixer on EVERY exit** (natural end and the
FADE_CORPSE_MAX cap-shift alike), or each death leaks a mixer update forever. `_fcCloneMats` is the
factored material-clone both roads share (the fade must never dim a live enemy sharing materials).
The ragdoll path still bakes the final frame deliberately — physics owns that motion. Three pins moved
(779, 994×2 — the old road is now the else of the clip-first try; intents kept).

## The sky becomes authorable (build 1234)

Reported from play: *"How can you change the sky color? No matter what it's always bright."* Two
verified findings behind one report: the procedural dome has been fully parameterised since 1119
(zenith/horizon/ground colours, haze, sun size/glow, its own exposure — all serialized with every
level) but **no editor UI ever wrote those fields** — only the arena generator's themes did; and a
dark dome alone cannot darken the SCENE, because the sun keeps lighting it and auto-exposure (1180)
lifts a dark frame right back up.

So the Sky fold gains the seven controls (three colour rows, Sky brightness, Haze, Sun size/glow) AND
five mood presets — ☀ Day / 🌅 Sunset / 🌙 Night / ☁ Overcast / 🌑 Blood moon — where a preset sets
the COHERENT PACKAGE: dome colours + sun strength/colour/elevation + fog colour + auto-exposure
strength. Night dims the sun to 0.28 (the dim cool "sun" IS the moonlight) and holds autoExp at 0.15,
or the eye undoes the dark; "night" without those is a black ceiling over a sunny afternoon. A preset
also CLEARS any HDRI URL — an active HDRI silently covers the dome (the 1223 class of confusion), and
choosing a procedural mood is choosing the procedural sky. Day is DEFAULT_WORLD's sky restated
field-for-field (test-enforced), so stock is always one click back. Every field stays individually
editable; the day/night cycle animates on top of whatever is authored.

`test-1234` executes the REAL dome model with the presets — Night's zenith reads >10x darker than
Day's and a Blood-moon horizon is red-dominant, proving the model was never the limit — and executes
`applySkyMood` (sun dimmed, autoExp held, HDRI cleared, unrelated fields untouched, one
applyWorldCfg). One pin moved (1115 — its slice anchored on the bare prefix `function applySky`,
which `applySkyMood` now matches first; anchor gained parens). NOT capture-verified: eyeball the five
presets in a browser once.

## The ground query was reading the roof (build 1233)

Reported from play: *"I added enemies onto a multistorey building and they would randomly clip through
the floor and just disappear."* Probed and MEASURED before fixing (the house rule): an actor with feet
on a storey-2 slab at y=3.2 asked the engine for its ground and got **0 — the terrain**.

The mechanism: `groundHeightAt` asked `surfaceTopAt(x,z)` for the column's HIGHEST surface, which
inside any roofed building is the ROOF or the slab overhead — never the floor underfoot. The
step/ramp gates then rejected that too-high surface and the function answered terrain. The enemy
frame loop HARD-SNAPS `y = groundY + 1.4`, so one wrong answer teleported an enemy through every slab
to under the building — invisible, "disappeared". The player integrates gravity off the same function,
so the player fell through roofed upper floors too, and even ground-floor actors stood SUNK to the
terrain instead of on the slab. Roofs and open decks read correctly (the surface underfoot IS the
topmost there) — which is why the generated arenas' open-air decks never showed it and the bug waited
for the first creator to put enemies INSIDE a building. "Randomly" = wander under a slab and you fall;
step onto the open deck and you don't.

The fix is one function: surfaces above `feetY + RAMP_RISE` cannot be stepped or ramped onto BY
DEFINITION of the gates below, so the query is **ceilinged** there (`surfaceTopAt`'s existing `ceilY`
param — build 739's, never passed here) — and the ramp SLOPE PROBE's two neighbour samples carry the
same ceiling, or an indoor ramp under a roof reads as a cliff. The bot path's shared `_candSurf` hint
(fed to both `clearAt` and its ground resolve) takes the ceiling at its source. Player, bots, remote
avatars and PvE enemies all ground through this one function, so all inherit the repair.

Two honest notes: an overhang LOWER than `RAMP_RISE` (a sub-1.7 m mezzanine) still poisons its column
(the highest in-window surface is the overhang, the gates reject it) — strictly better than before,
when ANY overhead geometry poisoned it, and rare geometry; and mid-air far above a slab the window can
still catch the roof and read terrain — harmless, because an integrating faller is not grounded there
and by arrival the answer is the slab (both cases pinned in `test-1233` with their reasons). This
likely also carried a chunk of the other two reports in the same play session: an enemy teleported
under the building never dies and never stops pathing — accumulating invisible enemies are a frame-rate
drain and read as "stuck/buggy" from above. Three pins moved (364×2, and 1233's own falling-window
expectation corrected during writing); `test-1233` replays the report on real slab geometry.

## Verbs reach the event's player (build 1232)

1231's recorded other half, closed the cheap way: no new message type. The world verbs' "The player"
is TEAM-WIDE by design (host applies locally + wact broadcast to every client) — so "teleport the
player who stepped on the pad", "give the key to the one who earned it", "heal only the capturer"
were inexpressible. The who dropdown gains **"The event's player"** ('actor'), give/take gain the who
field, and `_wactToActor(o)` does the delivery: a REMOTE actor gets the IDENTICAL `{t:'wact', ...}`
payload over `sendToPlayer` (the client applies what it always has), a local/solo actor falls through
to the local branch — with the team-wide broadcast suppressed in both cases, because actor means ONE
player. Solo's pid is 0 = the host, so an actor-graph authored solo just works. `test-1232` drives
the REAL `_applyWorldAction` for heal/teleport/give/kill/damage in remote-actor and local-actor forms
with team-wide controls proving the old verbs byte-identical. One pin moved (1073 — who's verb list
gained give/take; intent kept). With 1231+1232, a KOTH/CTF-shaped mode is now authorable: per-actor
trigger edges → `score@`/Math per player → actor-targeted rewards.

## The graph learns WHO (build 1231) — per-player logic, first slice

The multiplayer critic's root ceiling ("8 hardcoded modes a creator can't extend — needs per-player/team
scoping"), opened where it was cheapest and most load-bearing. Three pieces, all riding 1221's context:

- **Triggers fire per ACTOR.** `updateTriggerZones` tracked ONE anonymous union boolean over every
  player, so the second player's entry was invisible and one player leaving while another stayed
  produced NO exit at all — "who stepped on the pad" was structurally unaskable. Every zone now tracks
  edges per player (`_trigStepActor`, per-actor state under the zone's `st.a`) and fires the event
  through `_lgPlayerEvent` with `{pid, team, x, z}`. The once-flag stays ZONE-global (once means once,
  not once per player); a DEAD player reads as outside, so dying on the hill fires the same exit edge
  as walking off it (what a KOTH graph needs to be true); solo, one actor = the exact old semantics.
  The ENEMY path deliberately keeps the identityless union — an enemy has no pid, and per-enemy edges
  would turn a 40-strong wave crossing a zone into 40 pulses no graph asked for.
- **Variables scope per player with a trailing `@`.** `_lgVarKey` maps `coins@` to `coins@<ctx pid>`;
  every read (`_lgNum`) and every write (setvar/addvar/math/read, and `{coins@}` toast interpolation —
  whose regex gained `@`) routes through the one function. No player in context resolves to `@0` (the
  host), so a per-player graph authored solo behaves identically alone, and plain names are
  byte-identical — no existing graph changes.
- **onkill knows the KILLER.** The context gains `pid`/`team` from `_coopKillFor` (the existing co-op
  credit: set during a client's `{t:'hit'}`), else the host — so "award the killer's `score@`" is one
  Math node now. `#pid`/`#team` join the always-offered autocomplete tokens.

`test-1231` executes the var scoping (per-player isolation, solo collapse, plain-name identity, `#i`
fallthrough intact) and the per-actor edges (second entry visible, exit-while-another-stays, zone-global
once, independent stay clocks). Eleven pins/harness scopes moved (1060×4 token count, 1072×2 the
per-actor shape, 47's char window — the documented trap again — and `_lgVarKey` stubs into the
1027/1058/1169/1221 scopes; every intent kept). **The recorded other half:** verbs that act ON the
event's player (heal/give/teleport the actor) need a host→client effect message — its own build.

## The library learns what people play (build 1230)

The feature panel's "no play-count/rating flywheel": the community library was a flat newest-first list
forever — no signal for what people actually play, which is the one thing a browsing player wants.
`server/api/plays.php` is a lobbies.php sibling (flat-file, no DB, no accounts): GET returns
`{id:{p,up}}`, POST `?id&a=play` counts a play at most once per IP per level per HOUR, POST `?a=up` a
thumbs-up once per IP ever. lobbies.php's hardening carried over whole: server clock only, salted IP
hashes (shared `rumpus-salt.txt` — one salt per host) never returned, id charset validation, 500-level
record cap, 5000-voter list cap, flock-atomic writes, the limiter table pruned every request. The
existing `.htaccess` already denies direct reads of every `.json`, so the new store is covered with no
change. **Deploy is a user action**: upload `api/plays.php` beside `lobbies.php` (see server/README.md).

Client wiring, all in the community modal: counts fetch IN PARALLEL with the index (rows render
immediately, counts pop in when they land — the library must never block on a second endpoint), the row
meta gains "· N plays", each row gets a 👍 button (one per browser via localStorage, the server dedups
by IP regardless; already-voted renders spent), and the sort menu gains **Most played** (plays → thumbs
→ newest) — offered ONLY once count data actually exists, so an unreachable endpoint leaves the menu
exactly as it was. A play reports when a library level loads FOR PLAY — an editor open is deliberately
not a play. Every write is fire-and-forget; `breach_plays_db` overrides the endpoint ('off' disables).

Two instrument notes: `_playsDb` ends a regex with `//`, which `extractFunction`'s brace-matcher reads
as a line comment (the documented string-literal trap, comment edition) — the test slices it between
function markers instead. And the first edit-script run aborted on the sort-menu anchor because the
"A – Z" label uses THIN SPACES (\u2009) around its en-dash — the atomic write-at-end meant nothing
half-applied, which is exactly why the scripts are written that way. One pin moved (970 — the sort list
gained a conditional head entry; intent kept).

## The editor teaches itself (build 1229)

The panel critic's onboarding finding, closed with machinery the engine already proved: build 938's
do-to-advance coach pill, editor edition. First time the editor opens (once per browser), a four-step
pill walks the whole loop — fly the camera (completes on ~6 units of ACCUMULATED camera strokes, so
mode switches and small moves all count), add a shape (prop count rises; the + auto-selects it, which
is why there is no separate "select" step — it would self-complete), move it (the primary selection
drifting 0.5 from a per-selection baseline; switching selection RE-BASELINES so clicking a distant prop
cannot false-complete the step), and play it (completes only in `startGame` — deploying is the tour's
whole point and ends it COMPLETE from any step).

Two decisions differ from 938 deliberately:
- **No auto-advance timeout.** Play's 15s exists so a coach never blocks combat; in the editor nothing
  blocks, a creator reads at their own pace, and the X is the exit. `test-1229` pins the timeout's
  ABSENCE.
- **The pill element is shared with the play coach, owner-stamped.** A brand-new user triggers both
  tours in one session; each render stamps `dataset.owner` ('play'/'ed'), the editor coach runs second
  in the loop so it wins the pill inside the editor, hides it only when it owns it, and the X dismisses
  whichever coach owns it right now. Without the stamp, whichever update ran last would clobber the
  other's pill every frame.

`test-1229` executes the real state machine through the full tour, the re-baselining, the
dismissed-forever key, and the no-clobber property. No pins moved.

## Attached lights ride duplication (build 1228)

The editor panel's "a lamp+light composite can't be moved/prefabbed as a unit", verified to its real
residue: build 997's nid-parenting already makes an attached light RIDE its prop (gizmo moves included),
but the `_pfEntryOf`/`_pfSpawnEntry` pair — which duplicate, Alt-drag, the clipboard (1176), array
(1225) and prefabs (1030) ALL route through — carried only the prop. Copy a finished lamppost and you
got a dark pole; 1225's array made that sting ten poles at a time. One fix in the pair covers all five
paths (1162's design paying off): the entry embeds each attached light via the same `_lightOpts` the
level file uses — the LIVE local transform when parented (a light nudged after attach copies where it
sits NOW), world position and host nid stripped — and the spawner rebuilds them bound to the copy's
FRESH nid, one frame before 997's reconciler snaps the exact parenting.

**Editor-time only, and that gate is the load-bearing line:** `buildLight` changes the scene's light
count, which must never change during play (636/977/1153/1155). The logic graph's `spawnprop` verb runs
`_pfSpawnEntry` MID-MATCH — so a runtime-spawned prefab arrives lightless (documented cost) rather than
recompiling every material in the level on spawn. Hostile entries cap at 8 lights per prop on both the
capture and spawn sides. `test-1228` executes the capture on a real THREE graph (live transform wins,
strays excluded, identity stripped), the spawn (fresh-nid rebind, editor gate, caps), and pins that all
five duplication paths route through the pair. No pins moved.

## Persistent inventory + checkpoint (build 1227)

1215's recorded other half, closing the feature panel's save-system item. Variables persisted; the
INVENTORY (keys, quest items, consumables — what an adventure game is made of) and the LAST CHECKPOINT
(where a returning player resumes) did not, so "close the tab, come back tomorrow" handed back the
numbers but not the run. Two creator opt-ins (checkboxes indented under "Also keep them between
sessions", disabled without it), riding the SAME namespaced blob under reserved keys `__inv`/`__cp` —
the variable loader accepts only NUMERIC values, so an old engine reading a new blob skips them
silently and a new engine reading an old blob finds nothing: two-way compatible by construction, no
format version needed.

The placement decisions are the build:
- **`_persistResume` is called by `startGame` AFTER its wipes.** `logicStart` (where `_persistSeed`
  runs) executes BEFORE `inventory.length=0`, so seeding items there would be erased — the resume call
  sits after the pvp/else branch, beside 1224's pose override, and takes `skipPos` so a play-from-here
  test pose outranks the saved checkpoint while the items still return.
- **Write-through, not commit-only.** Checkpoints happen mid-run and players quit mid-run, so
  `setCheckpoint` saves immediately (solo only), and `giveItem`/`takeItem` both write — a spent potion
  must stay spent on reload (executed: an emptied inventory persists as EMPTY).
- **`_persistCommit` (game cleared) clears the checkpoint but keeps the items** — the next run starts
  at the start, holding what was earned. It now also stores even with no vars authored, or the
  checkpoint clear would never land on a var-less level.
- **Solo only.** A co-op client restoring a private inventory or teleporting to a private checkpoint
  would desync the shared run; `_persistResume` returns for any NET mode but 'off'.
- **Hostile blobs clamp**: 999 per stack, 40 stacks, ids truncated at 40 chars.

`test-1227` executes the real store/load/resume/commit against a fake localStorage through the full
round trip and every guard above. Three pins moved (1215's store shape, 1075's loader line ×2 and its
harness scope — each keeps its intent). Restores are silent (no 12 pickup dings for 12 items) with one
"Resumed at your checkpoint" toast.

## Wandering NPCs, and the marker that demoted your boss to a grunt (build 1226)

The feature panel's civic gap: every moving creature was hostile, so a town, a quest hub, a story level
had nothing alive in it that wasn't trying to kill you. A spawn marker gains a **Friendly** checkbox
(green marker post, green capsule) — the NPC rides the SAME nav/patrol/route/separation stack with zero
new movement code, and the design is subtraction, done at every layer so no gate anywhere can misfire:
- **The brain**: `enemyDesiredTarget` demotes a friendly's hunt to patrol, skips the LOS raycast
  entirely (shared budget, and a friendly has no use for a sightline), and never sets `aware`.
  `alertEnemy` — the single door gunfire, blasts and the logic 'alert' verb all route through — slides
  off a friendly.
- **The spawn** disarms `ranged/exploder/charger/cover` at the source.
- **The accounting** forked into `_hostileAlive()` / `_hostilePending()` (queued friendlies subtracted):
  the HUD, the net snapshot's `en`, and the WAVE-CLEAR gate all count hostiles — a level whose villagers
  outlive every wave must still advance, and one populated only by villagers reads zero hostiles.
- **Waves never stack duplicates**: a friendly marker defaults to wave 0 (= every wave) but its NPC is
  never killed by play, so `startWave` skips a marker whose spawn is still alive (`e._mark === m`).
- **Killing one is a death, not a score event**: visuals, sound, ragdoll and the On-kill logic event all
  fire (a creator can wire "villager died → lose"), but kills/coins/score/lifesteal/boss-payday all gate
  off. Explosions and car impacts still hurt them — physics is physics.

**Two latent marker bugs fixed on the way, both real:** `buildSpawnMarker` validated `opts.type` against
a pre-628 THREE-entry list while the editor has offered all 8 since — so every saved
gunner/sapper/shielded/charger/boss marker silently DEMOTED TO GRUNT on reload (the list stays a literal
because ENEMY_TYPES is declared below the boot loader that runs this — TDZ, and `typeof` doesn't guard a
TDZ). And duplicate-marker had been dropping `type`/`wave`/`y` since those fields were added. `test-1226`
executes the brain (friendly vs identical hostile control), alertEnemy, the accounting, and pins the
rest. Seven pins moved (1197, 33, 47, 58, 80, 283, 415 — `en:` became the hostile count, killEnemy's
rewards gained the friendly gate, the LOS/detect lines gained `!en.friendly`; every intent kept).
Deferred, recorded: dialogue on a moving NPC (interact targets props, not enemies — its own build), and
friendlies fleeing gunfire rather than ignoring it.

## Align, distribute, array (build 1225)

The editor-UX panel's arrangement gap: the engine had grouping, snapping, duplication and a clipboard,
but no way to LINE THINGS UP — a row of fence posts was N drags and N squints. Three verbs in an
"Arrange" row under Group/Ungroup in the props picker (axis select + Min/Center/Max/Spread, and
⧉ Array with count + dx/dy/dz). Two semantics carry the correctness, both executed in `test-1225`:
- **Group members move as ONE UNIT.** A click selects the whole group, so a naive per-prop align would
  smash a group's internal arrangement flat onto the target line. `_arrUnits` partitions the selection
  by gid; a unit's span is the union of its members' world boxes; the whole unit shifts by one delta.
- **Alignment lines up world-space BOUNDING EDGES, not origins.** Two crates of different sizes
  "aligned min" share a face plane, which is what a builder means. The target edge is the SELECTION'S
  OWN min/centre/max, so nothing moves further than it must and align-to-the-leader falls out free.

Distribute is even CENTRE spacing with the two outermost units anchored (the standard convention);
needs 3+ units and refuses below that WITHOUT burning an undo snapshot — all three verbs are one
snapshot per gesture (1163's rule), and every refusal happens before the snapshot. Array duplicates
through the 1162 `_pfEntryOf`/`_pfSpawnEntry` pair, so copies carry full config (signals, tags,
materials, physics) and inherit new entry fields automatically; each copy is its OWN group (never
chained to the source), steps land at `pivot + step*i` (dy supported — stairs, shelves), a zero step
refuses rather than z-fighting copies inside each other, and the gesture budget is 24 copies hard,
~100 spawned props total (the paste cap's number). The dx field prefills with the selection's own
width so the default array lands copies side by side. Moved props get `refreshPropCollider` +
`_homeSync` (the gizmo drag's own bookkeeping); the axis choice persists across panel re-renders.

## Play from here, start at wave (build 1224)

The editor-UX panel's iteration-speed gap: a creator tuning wave 12 replayed waves 1-11 on every test
run, and testing a rooftop meant walking there from the player start every time. The play row gains
**"▶ From camera"** and a **wave** field (1..50); both write `_testStart`, which `startGame` consumes
**exactly once** — nulled even when its solo guard fails, so a pose captured for a solo test can never
leak into a later multiplayer deploy — and which never serialises: a test convenience, not level data.

Ordering is the correctness, and both halves were forced by code already there:
- **The wave override lands BEFORE `startWave()`** queues the first wave (clamped to the manifest cap,
  pvp skipped — no waves there). The wave-12 HP ramp applies at spawn, which is the point: test what the
  player will actually face.
- **The pose override lands AFTER the pvp/else branch**, because the pvp branch also writes `player.pos`
  and an earlier override would be silently discarded. The pose clamps above the terrain (a top-view
  pose can never spawn underground) and arrives airborne with zero velocity — a fly pose high over the
  level simply falls in, which is the honest reading of "from the camera".

`_edTestPose()` captures per camera mode: fly = the fly camera with altitude and look (fly look reuses
`player.yaw/pitch`); walk = the avatar; top view = the pan point standing ON the ground, pitch 0 — not
hundreds of metres up at the top camera. A test run also skips the authored intro flythrough (`!_ts` in
the `_introWillPlay` gate): the creator is iterating, not watching; the cine preview exists for framing.
`test-1224` executes the pose capture across all three modes and pins the consume-once, the two
orderings, the clamps, and that `serializeLevel` never mentions the override. Three pins moved (27, 330,
422 — the play handler grew a wave read between autosave and deploy; each keeps its intent).

## A loaded HDRI now shows immediately (build 1223)

Reported from play: *"when loading an HDRI, nothing visually shows until I make an adjustment on the HDRI
settings like sky rotation or reflection strength — then the sky shows up just fine."* The mechanism:
`applySky()` is the ONLY place that hides the procedural dome when an HDRI is active (`on = skyMode==='sky'
&& !hdri; _skyMesh.visible = on`), and the HDRI load-completion path (`_applyOrientedSky`) set
`scene.background` + PMREM **without ever calling it** — so the dome, a mesh a metre from the camera, kept
covering the freshly-set background until ANY settings change happened to run `applyWorldCfg → applySky`.
That poke is exactly what "adjusting sky rotation" did.

Both completion paths (success and the rotation-failed fallback) now call `applySky()` — the function whose
stated job is "everything the sky drives, applied together so they can never disagree" — and so does the
inverse branch: clearing the HDRI URL re-shows the dome NOW instead of on the next unrelated settings
change (a latent bug found by symmetry, not by report). `test-1223` executes `_applyOrientedSky` against a
dome-and-gate stub proving the dome is hidden by the time the success status fires, on the fallback too,
and pins the clear-URL branch and applySky's single ownership. The general lesson joins 1143's: when one
function is the declared owner of an agreement, every path that changes the underlying state must route
through it — setting the state directly and skipping the owner is how the two halves drift.

## The sprint-FOV was the reported zoom-bounce stutter (build 1222)

Reported from play the day after 1210 shipped: *"when walking or running, the scene/camera tries to zoom
and bounces back very fast — a stutter or glitch every few seconds."* And it was exactly that. Build 1210's
sprint push was gated on `player.onGround`, which **flickers FALSE for single frames mid-stride** — the
SAME flicker builds 926 (slide) and 1160 (jump) had to buffer — so at full sprint the FOV snapped 6°
out and back in one frame, unsmoothed, every time the ground test blinked. Two fixes, both structural:
- **The gate is GONE.** Speed-FOV tracks SPEED; airborne horizontal speed is still speed (Apex/CoD keep
  the push through a jump), and the landing dip remains the landing cue. The flickering condition no
  longer exists in the expression at all, which is stronger than buffering it.
- **The value is EASED** through persistent `_sprintFovCur` (`+= (target−cur)·min(1, dt·8)`, snapped at
  the last 0.01 so a settled lens stops paying `updateProjectionMatrix`), so no single-frame condition of
  ANY kind can ever step the lens again.

The lesson, third time now: **any per-frame boolean that gates a continuous visual quantity is a glitch
waiting for that boolean to flicker.** 926/1160 buffered the boolean; 1222's stronger form is to remove
the boolean from the continuous path and ease the quantity. `test-1222` replays the exact glitch (an
adversarial single-frame zero moves the eased lens < 0.9° where the old code snapped 6°) and pins the
gate's absence. Two pins moved (1210, 964). The 1210 quadratic curve and ADS fold-out are unchanged.

## Logic events carry a payload now (build 1221)

The editor/feature panel's ceiling on what the graph can author: `onkill`/`onhurt`/`onspot` fired BARE — no
identity, no position, no HP — so "drop loot where the enemy died", "the boss at half health switches
phase", "the turret nearest the intruder powers on" were all inexpressible. This is the same root the
open-work list records for per-player variables ("the runtime's pulses carry no actor identity"), attacked
for enemy events. A context object `_lgCtx` now rides the immediate pulse cascade, exposed as reserved
`#`-tokens that `_lgNum` resolves — `#x`/`#z` (world position), `#hp`, `#hpf` (HP fraction 0..1) — readable
by Branch, Math, Set variable, and the place field via `#here`. The token handler FALLS THROUGH to a normal
variable when the context has no such key, so the repeat loop's existing `#i` still works (the one trap this
build had to avoid, pinned). `_lgEnemyEvent(kind, ctx)` sets the context and unwinds it in a `finally` — a
Delay node schedules a later timer that runs with no context, so the payload is a snapshot of the moment,
not a live handle (recorded, not a bug). All three enemy events pass `{x, z, hp, hpf}`; `onkill` (which
fires through `_lgFireEvents` in `killEnemy`) sets `_lgCtx` around its call. `#x/#z/#hp/#hpf` are always
offered in the variable autocomplete and `#here` in the place autocomplete. `test-1221` executes `_lgNum`
(tokens resolve, `#i` falls through), `_lgEnemyEvent` (sets AND unwinds), and `_lgPlaceAt` (`#here` → event
position, null outside an event). Five pins moved (1027, 1060, 1077×2, 47 — the last a char-window widen,
the exact "unanchored window scoped by a character count" trap CLAUDE.md warns about). Player/team event
identity is the remaining piece of the same ceiling.

## Co-op kills stop landing flat (build 1220)

The gameplay-feel panel's last MEDIUM, closing the panel entirely. `killEnemy` gates the 0.07 s hitstop on
`NET.mode==='off'` and `registerLocalKill` gates the triple-kill slow-mo the same way, so a co-op kill
produced marker + sound only — the crunch that sells a kill was missing in exactly the social mode.
Slowing the sim online would desync every peer (legitimately unsafe), but a LOCAL cosmetic jolt is not:
`registerLocalKill` now punches the camera (`shake = max(shake, n>=3 ? 0.15 : 0.06)`) in netplay only,
bigger on a multi-kill. Solo is byte-unchanged — it keeps its real hitstop (fired in `killEnemy`) and
slow-mo, so there is no double-crunch. Both host and client kills get it (the client via the `{t:'frag'}`
credit path that calls `registerLocalKill`). `test-1220` executes all three modes proving solo has no shake
and its hitstop/slow-mo intact, while co-op host and client jolt without ever touching the networked
time-scale. **The gameplay-feel critic panel is now fully cleared** (1208–1213, 1219, 1220).

## The crosshair shows what the gun is doing (build 1219)

The gameplay-feel panel's MEDIUM: build 1161 made movement and airtime cost accuracy, but `#crosshair` was
a static reticle whose only dynamic property was ADS opacity — so the player had no readout of "I am
currently inaccurate", and 1161's airborne spread floor felt like random misses instead of a rule to
stop-and-shoot around. The spread math is hoisted into `_curSpread(w)` — shared by `shoot()` and the
crosshair, so the reticle can never disagree with the shot — and the four arms offset outward from a single
CSS var `--xh-bloom`, eased each frame toward `min(18, _curSpread()*90)` px (breathes, never snaps, clamps
so it never flies apart). A scoped optic already sets the reticle opacity to 0, so the bloom is invisible
and free there. Standing-still values are byte-identical to 1161 (proven executable). `test-1219` drives
`_curSpread` across the states and the easing/clamp, and pins that all four arms move away from centre and
that `shoot()` reads the same function. One 1161 pin pair moved to the hoisted function, intent kept.
**Needs a browser pass to feel** — jump and watch the reticle open, land and watch it close.

## The G-buffer prepass outlives the AO sample (build 1218)

The rendering panel's HIGH: `_aoWant = _ssaoAmt>0.001 && _prStepI===0 && ...` gated BOTH the half-res
G-buffer prepass and the expensive AO kernel+blur, and build 1183's soft-particle / 1184's soft-shoreline
fade read the same flag — so the FIRST adaptive downshift (85% res, a common mid-range steady state) shed
SSAO, soft particles AND soft shorelines together, and the image most players actually see lost its
grounding while still paying for bloom, fog and the grade. The gate is split: `_geoWant` runs the prepass
(which writes the view distance the soft-particle/shoreline fade reads from `_aoGeoRT.a`) across the top
three rungs (`_AO_GEO_MAXSTEP = 2` → 100/85/72%); `_aoWant = _geoWant && _prStepI===0` keeps the AO SAMPLE
on rung 0 only. So a downshift now sheds only the AO kernel; soft particles keep their fade. The prepass
render moved into an `if(_geoWant)` block, the AO kernel into a later `if(_aoWant)`, and `_SOFT_P.value.x`
keys on `_geoWant`. Build 1135's "AO rides the resolution step, below MSAA" intent is preserved in `_aoWant`.
The critic's other half — a reduced-kernel AO on rung 1 instead of shedding it outright — is deferred because
it needs a measured tuning pass this can't do headlessly. `test-1218` evaluates both gates across the rungs
and pins the structural split; three pins moved (1126 passed untouched, 1140 + 1183 to the new gate names).
**Needs a browser pass to confirm** — force a downshift and watch soft particles stay soft.

## Water reflects the live sky (build 1217)

The rendering panel's finding, verified in code: `_waterSurfaceMat` set `uSky` to `0x9fc8d8` at CONSTRUCTION
and `updateWaterZones` wrote uTime/uLight/uSunDir/uSunCol but never uSky — so at sunset, at night, under an
authored HDRI or a volcanic sky, a lake held a flat noon-blue sheen at grazing angles while everything
around it changed colour. `SCENE_FOG.color` IS the sky at the horizon (`applySky` sets it from a ring of
`skyRadiance` horizon samples of the same sky model, recomputed on the day-cycle cadence), so
`updateWaterZones` now copies it into `uSky` every frame — one `Color` copy per zone, no new pass. A lake
goes warm at dusk and dark at night. The constructor value is now just a seed. `test-1217` executes the
copy semantics and pins that the write lives in the per-zone uniform block and that `SCENE_FOG.color` is the
averaged horizon radiance. The richer per-direction env-cube reflection the critic also mentioned is the
larger follow-up; this closes the "flat wrong colour" half. **Needs a browser pass to see** (the Node
harness can't render water) — capture a lake at dusk.

**NINTH container rollback, recovered mid-build**, same signature (tree + HEAD reverted to 1182, bump assert
aborted atomically). Recovery `git fetch` + `reset --hard FETCH_HEAD`. Worth noting for the re-apply: the
water uniform block had been split across two lines by build 1184, so the 1182-era anchor missed on the
recovered 1216 tree — a reminder that a rollback restores an OLD file and the re-apply anchors must match
the RECOVERED build, not the one the aborted edit was written against.

## The logic graph can create a prop now (build 1216)

The feature-surface panel's HIGH, and build 1170's explicitly-deferred other half: show/hide/move/destroy
existed but nothing could CREATE — so a tycoon's "buy → building appears", a wave-defense buildable turret,
a farming drop, a sandbox spawner toy were all inexpressible; every quantity was fixed at author time. The
new `spawnprop <prefab> @place` verb spawns a prefab at a resolved place through the ready `_pfSpawnEntry`
(the same spawner prefabs, duplicate and the clipboard already route through). Three things make it small:
- **No new net code.** 1170 recorded the net-id story as the hard part; it isn't. The spawned props carry
  nids (`finalizeProp` assigns them), so the existing prop reconciler (`reconcileProps`) pAdds them to every
  client on its next tick — hence the handler sends NO `wact` message. Host-only, because `updateLogic`
  returns for clients.
- **A LIVE cap** (`LG_SPAWN_CAP` 200, counting props still in the scene so destroyed ones free budget) stops
  a spawnprop-on-an-interval from filling the world; a refused spawn is reported through 1214's
  `_noteLogicFailure`, as is a missing prefab or a place nothing answers.
- **Spawned props are marked `_lgSpawned`** so they never touch the saved LEVEL — a runtime verb must not
  edit the level (1170's rule).

`test-1216` executes `_lgSpawnPrefab` (spawns all a prefab's props at the place under one group, marks them,
reports a missing prefab, enforces the live cap AND frees it as props are destroyed, refuses on a client)
and pins the verb/field/datalist/handler. Three place-field pins moved (1073, 1077, 1170) for the added
`spawnprop`, intent kept.

## Persistent saves stop clobbering each other (build 1215)

The feature-surface panel's finding, verified in code: `_persistStore` wrote `campaignVars` into ONE global
key (`breach_persist_v1`), so two published games that both persist a `coins` variable read and clobber
each other's progress — a returning player finding someone else's `questStage` in their save is a
trust-destroying bug waiting in the wild. The store is now namespaced: `_persistKey(ns)` appends the
published `/game/` slug (build 972), or the slugified homepage title, to the base key; a level with neither
keeps the BARE key, so every existing single-game save loads unchanged — that is the migration, no data
lost. `_persistLoad(ns)` takes the namespace EXPLICITLY because `restoreLevel` calls it before `homepageCfg`
is set, so both loaders pass `_persistNSFrom(level.homepage)`; `_persistStore`/`clearPersistent` read the
live `homepageCfg`, which is correct by commit/clear time. `slugify` is length-capped so a hostile title
can't mint a giant key. `test-1215` executes the precedence (slug > title > bare), proves two games land on
different keys while the same game is stable, and pins the wiring; the 1075 harness gained the helpers and
its loader-count pin moved. Inventory + last-checkpoint persistence (the critic's other half) is the larger
follow-up; the namespacing was the correctness fix.

**EIGHTH container rollback, recovered mid-build.** The bump assert fired (atomic abort — the persist edits
were computed but never written) and the tree had reverted to build 1182 with HEAD there too. Origin's
branch still held 1199–1214, so recovery was `git fetch` + `reset --hard FETCH_HEAD`, then re-apply the
aborted edit from the scripted step (free). Same signature, same one-command recovery — the bump assert
caught it before a single wrong byte landed.

## The logic graph stops swallowing its failures (build 1214)

The editor-UX panel's CRITICAL #1: the graph's only actuator wrapped `_applySignalAction` in
`try{}catch(e){}`, so a misspelled tag, a bad clip, a wrong place field all did NOTHING — no console line,
no toast, no Level Check entry. The highest-investment editor activity had the worst feedback loop: the
only way to debug "why didn't my door open" was redeploy-replay-stare-guess. Now, mirroring the 1167 asset
report: `_noteLogicFailure(msg)` records failures (deduped by message, capped at 20), the `do` node checks
a tag-based verb's target with `_lgTagExists` and records "targets the tag X, but no placed prop has that
tag" when nothing answers, the catch records a thrown verb, and `levelIssues()` surfaces them as "Logic
(last run): …". The graph runs only during play and `levelIssues` renders in the editor, so this is a
play-time log read at author-time — exactly the critic's "what happened last run", and it needs no
live-while-playing inspector.

The tag check covers only the target-bearing verbs (`_LG_TAG_VERBS`: toggle/open/close/anim/unlock +
the four prop-lifecycle verbs) — NOT the placeless world verbs (spawn/teleport/win act on a place or the
run, so a "missing tag" there would be a false alarm). The log clears on wipe and restore (stale failures
about a previous level are their own lie) and refreshes the panel live if a failure lands while the editor
is open. `test-1214` executes the recorder (dedup/count/cap), `_lgTagExists`, and the REAL do-node branch
driven to prove it notes a missing tag (naming verb + tag) but not a resolved one nor a placeless verb. One
1027 harness gained stubs for the new refs. The live pin-value / execution-trace inspector the critic also
wanted is the larger follow-up; surfacing the silent failures was the load-bearing half.

## The difficulty curve keeps evolving (build 1213)

The gameplay-feel panel's HIGH #6: `pickEnemyType` froze the mix from wave 5 on, and its outcome set never
included **shielded** or **charger** — the two most mechanically interesting enemies (flank / dodge
counterplay), which existed only in authored spawns. Escalation was COUNT-ONLY (`n = 3 + wave*2`), so wave
20 was 43 grunts — a spam/ammo problem, not a pressure problem. Two changes:
- **Two new tiers.** Wave ≥ 8 folds in the Shieldbearer (~8%), wave ≥ 12 the Charger (~8%), with the base
  roster rebalanced under them. Waves 1–5 are byte-unchanged (the 21 pins on wave 1 and wave 5 still pass).
  A deep wave now carries a real fraction of both advanced types while grunts drop below a majority — the
  mix keeps forcing weapon/positioning changes instead of asking the same question louder.
- **A gentle HP ramp.** `_eff.hp × (1 + 0.04·min(wave,25))`, capped at +100% by wave 25, applied to both
  `hp` and `maxHp` so damage numbers and kill credit stay consistent. **Random mode only** and off in the
  editor: a prebuilt/manifest level owns its own difficulty, so the ramp is exactly 1× there.

The milestone boss stays in `randomWaveDescriptors`, deliberately separate from `pickEnemyType`, so a
manifest wave still never gets an automatic boss (the author owns composition — 1179's rule). `test-1213`
executes `pickEnemyType` across the curve (wave 5 unchanged, 8 adds shielded, 12 adds charger, deep-wave
distribution measured) and pins the random-mode gating and the cap. Two pins moved (1191, 21) for the
`_hp` rename, intent kept.

## The hitmarker stopped lying about headshots (build 1212)

The gameplay-feel panel's HIGH #4: `showHitmarker` had two states — white ✕ (hit) and red ✖ (kill) — and
the duel + co-op-client paths passed `isHead`, so a NON-LETHAL headshot rendered the red KILL marker: a
false kill-confirm in exactly the mode where you cannot see the target's HP, and a false kill makes players
disengage from a live target. Solo headshots meanwhile had no distinct feedback at all (the "layering" was
`SFX.hit()` twice — +3 dB, not a distinct crack).

Now three states — hit / **head** (yellow ✛, its own glyph AND colour, so it can never be confused with a
kill) / kill — with legacy boolean callers still mapping (truthy → kill, falsy → hit). `SFX.headshot()` is
a real high dink (1400→1950 Hz sine), replacing the double-hit hack everywhere. Six call sites updated: the
three client-side headshot bugs (pvp client, enemy client, turret client) now render the head state; the
host/solo/turret-host paths rank kill > head > hit and dink a non-lethal headshot. `test-1212` renders all
three states against a fake DOM (proving the head marker is distinct in both glyph and colour and can never
be the kill marker), checks legacy-boolean compatibility, and pins every call site plus the retired
double-hit hack. Three pins moved (31, 81, and 31's second), intent kept.

## Gunshots got weight, and reload audio tells the truth (build 1211)

The gameplay-feel panel's CRITICAL #3, completing the audio pair with 1208. Every shot was one tone + one
noise — no sub-bass transient, no tail, no compressor — so weapons were distinguishable but all sounded
like the same toy at different pitches, and mag-dumping was N identical clipping-adjacent blips. Now:
- **`_SHOT_LAYERS`** gives each weapon three layers: a sub-bass sine thump (45–70 Hz, fast attack — the
  weight), the EXACT tuned body/crack pair the guns always had (byte-for-byte, pinned — the safe-change
  rule), and a delayed lowpassed noise re-trigger as a pseudo-tail (the space answering). The sniper thumps
  deepest and rings longest; the SMG stays snappy; the suppressed 'phut' is deliberately tail-less —
  that is what a suppressor is for.
- **A gentle `DynamicsCompressor` on `sfxBus`** (threshold −18, ratio 4, fast attack) so layered and
  overlapping shots stack musically instead of clipping; every SFX already routes through the bus, so no
  call site changed, and construction falls back to the plain connect if unavailable.
- **Reload clicks track the real `reloadMs`** — start, mag-out at ~45%, mag-in at `reloadMs−120` — where
  the old pair was hardcoded 550 ms apart, so the pistol's audio finished late and the sniper's a second
  early. The 1172 reload-cancel token makes a cancelled reload's later clicks... still fire (the timeouts
  are not tokenised) — a cosmetic stale click on cancel, noted as the known cost; tokenising the SFX
  timeouts rides the next audio build if it bothers anyone in play.

`test-1211` extracts and executes the layer table (authored values preserved, per-weapon shaping compared)
and the real `reload()` under fake timers (sniper 1600 ms and pistol 700 ms schedules both land), and pins
the compressor + fallback. Three pins moved (227, 44, 91), each keeping its intent through the table.

## The first-person camera has a body (build 1210)

The gameplay-feel panel's HIGH: on foot the camera never reacted to the player's own body — build 730's
speed-FOV lived only in the driving branch, jumping off a tower and landing produced nothing, and there was
no strafe lean, so movement (despite 1171's acceleration) read as a camera on rails. Three additions, all in
the existing loop:
- **Landing impact.** The air→ground frame (where `_playerWasAir` is still true and `player.vel.y` still
  holds the fall speed, before it is zeroed) kicks a spring-damped eye-dip (`_landDip`, stiff and
  well-damped — a quick dip and settle, no wobble), a touch of shake, and `SFX.land` — a lowpassed thud
  that grows with impact. Gated `!drivingCar` (the car owns its own landings).
- **Sprint FOV.** `_sprintFov = f²·6·(1−adsBlend)` where f is ground speed over top speed, ADDED to the
  ADS-blended `wantFov` so it survives aiming being zero and folds out completely while aiming.
- **Strafe lean.** Lateral velocity (`vel · camera-right`) rolls `camera.rotation.z` via an eased,
  clamped `_camLean`, killed while aiming so the sight stays true; folded into both the shake and no-shake
  camera-roll writes.

`test-1210` integrates the real dip spring (proves a visible dip, a clean settle to exactly 0, and no
bounce), the quadratic sprint curve (full 6° at top speed, 0 while aiming), and the clamped lean (rolls
away from lateral velocity, killed by ADS), plus the wiring. One 964 pin moved (wantFov gained the sprint
term), intent kept. Numbers (dip stiffness 90/14, sprint 6°, lean 0.006 clamped 0.05) are the tuning levers.

## Enemies acknowledge bullets (build 1209)

The gameplay-feel panel's CRITICAL #2: a non-lethal hit was a 0.12 s emissive flash and NOTHING else — a
Brute ate 30 rounds at unchanged speed, and a melee wind-up or charger lunge telegraph could not be broken
short of a kill, so shooting read as "my gun is weak" regardless of DPS. `enemyHurt` now applies three
physical reactions, all host-side and all reusing machinery that already replicates:
- a **flinch** shove along the shot direction via the `evx`/`evz` integrator (melee's own knockback, decayed
  per frame and netcode-safe), scaled by the fraction of max-HP the hit took and capped at 2.5 so a minigun
  does not launch anyone;
- a brief **speed slow** (`_slowT`, 0.15 s) that the movement block multiplies in at 0.55× — the beeline/
  patrol `spd` and every ranged cover/flank/standoff approach site — so a hit costs a step of ground;
- a **heavy-hit interrupt**: a hit taking ≥ ¼ of max HP cancels a melee wind-up (`_windupT`) and a
  charger's lunge telegraph (`_lungeWind`/`_lungePending`), so a shotgun blast to a winding-up brute
  actually stops the swing, while a light hit leaves the commitment intact.

This pairs directly with 1208: you now hear the hit land at the enemy's position AND see it react. The slow
decays beside the knockback integrator in the per-enemy update. `test-1209` executes `enemyHurt` proving the
directional shove, the HP-fraction scaling and clamp, the slow, and the heavy-vs-light interrupt threshold;
a lethal hit still just kills. The dedicated hit-slow number (0.55) and the flinch cap are the levers if
play tuning wants them softer.

## The engine finally has ears (build 1208)

The gameplay-feel panel's #1: there was NO positional audio anywhere — every sound routed flat into
`sfxBus`, so enemy gunfire, an explosion to your left, a charger winding up behind you all arrived
dead-centre, and the directional hit indicator carried threat-detection the ear should have done a second
earlier. `_spatialOut(at)` returns a `StereoPanner` (equal-power, so no centre volume dip) feeding
`sfxBus`, panned by the source's position along the CAMERA'S OWN right axis — read from `matrixWorld`, so
it tracks pitch, vehicles and the top-down/side play-cameras, not just yaw — and attenuated by distance,
returning `null` past ~55 m so the caller skips an inaudible node entirely. With no `at`, no `camera` yet,
or a browser without `createStereoPanner`, it is `sfxBus` unchanged, so UI/self sounds and old browsers are
byte-identical.

`tone`/`noise`/`playSample` gained an `at` option that routes through it; the world-positioned SFX
(`enemyShot`, `explode`, `shatter`, `kill`, `hit`, and the pre-existing distance-only `shootAt`, whose
hand-rolled gain the shared panner replaces) forward a position, and the call sites pass one — the bolt
origin at both enemy-fire sites, the blast centre, the enemy mesh, where a prop broke. UI/HUD sounds
(coin, buy, wave, pickup, jump, deny) deliberately stay unpositioned — they are player-centric, not world
events. `test-1208` executes `_spatialOut` against a fake WebAudio graph (hard-right/left/centre pans,
distance attenuation, out-of-range null-skip, camera-basis tracking proven under a yawed camera, and all
three graceful-fallback paths) and pins the threading. Five pins across four audio tests moved to the
`at`-bearing signatures, intent kept, and the 53 runnable harness gained `_spatialOut` in its isolated
scope. The three-layer weapon-body/tail/compressor work the same critic flagged is a separate build.

## The room got a ceiling and a rate limit (build 1207)

The fresh panel's multiplayer CRITICAL #2. `on('connection')` accepted every peer unconditionally, and
pAdd/pMov/pDel/chat had no inbound rate cap — so anyone with the room code (the lobby directory publishes
them) could open unlimited connections to exhaust the host's 20 Hz fan-out and CPU, or flood `pAdd` to
inject thousands of props and force every peer to fetch a hostile GLB. Two guards, both mirroring the
1164 damage-bucket pattern:

- **A mode-shaped player ceiling.** `_maxPlayersFor()` is 2 for a duel (strictly 1v1), 8 otherwise.
  `_hostOnConnection` refuses a fresh peer once `clients + 1 (host) >= cap` with a clean `{t:'full'}` send
  then close — the client surfaces "room is full" instead of hanging on "connecting". A rejoiner reclaiming
  a FREE id (`_rejoinFree`, factored out of the 1201 id-keep test) is admitted even at the ceiling, so
  migration and reconnection are never blocked by the cap.
- **A structural leaky bucket.** `_structAllow(id)` refills at `STRUCT_RATE` (20/s) per source with a
  `STRUCT_BURST` (40) ceiling; pAdd/pMov/pDel/chat each spend one token and are DROPPED over budget before
  they apply or relay. Per-source, so one flooder cannot starve an innocent client; generous against any
  real editor or chat cadence. `dropClient` frees both the struct and damage buckets with the leaver.

`test-1207` executes the real accept decision (8th player fills the room, 9th refused, duel caps at 2,
free-slot rejoiner admitted past the ceiling) and the real bucket (a 200-message flood passes only the
burst, sources independent, refills over a second). One 1201 pin moved for the `_rejoinFree` rename, intent
kept. The deeper netcode items the panel raised — lag-compensated / geometry-validated hits, a real TURN,
persistent identity — are larger and recorded, not built here.

## The bake stopped restarting itself (build 1206)

The fresh panel's performance CRITICAL. `_bakeTick` gated on `_bakeDoneN === colliders.length`, so ANY
collider-count change re-queued the FULL vertex-AO bake — and `_bakeCollect` already EXCLUDES movers,
dynamic props and no-src walls, so hiding a wall, toggling a crate, shattering a physics breakable, or
animating an `xa` door (none of which the bake even looks at) each restarted a whole-level re-shade at
6 ms/frame. A logic graph blinking an `xa` door on an interval made that perpetual, and sustained 6 ms is
exactly what `_adaptResTick` reads as load — so the invisible job could buy a visible resolution downshift.

The gate is now a SIGNATURE: `_bakeSig()` counts the colliders the bake would actually gather (src-bearing,
non-mover). The O(1) fast path survives — an unchanged `colliders.length` still returns immediately — and
only when the length changed does it walk the one cheap loop; if the signature is unchanged (a wall, a
mover, a dynamic prop moved) it updates the cached length and returns without re-baking. Completion records
both length and signature. A static bake prop genuinely leaving (a shattered non-physics breakable, a
`hideprop`'d static) still re-bakes, correctly — that occlusion really changed. Separately, the job's
per-frame budget drops from `BAKE_MS` (6) to 2 ms once `_prStepI > 0` (the resolution scaler has engaged),
so even a legitimate re-bake yields to the scaler instead of fighting it. `test-1206` executes `_bakeSig`
over a mixed set (wall/dynamic/vehicle/animating-door changes do NOT move it; a static-prop shatter does)
and pins the gate; two 1195 pins moved with it, intent kept. The per-vertex dirty-rect re-bake the critic
also suggested (re-shade only vertices within BAKE_RANGE of the changed box) is the larger follow-up — this
build removes the perpetual-restart, which was the whole of the CRITICAL.

## The relayed claim was unbounded (build 1205)

A fresh six-critic panel (run against build 1204, the roadmap-complete tree) surfaced this as a verified
CRITICAL, and it is a real security hole in the marquee competitive mode. Builds 1130/1164 clamp damage
aimed AT THE HOST, but `handleClientMsg`'s build-1122 forward path relayed a packet addressed to a THIRD
client VERBATIM — so in any 3+ player FFA a cheat sent `{t:'pvpHit', to:victim, d:1e9}` and one-shot
anyone, through walls, unrated. The docs advertised protection the relay path never had.

The host mediates now. A relayed `pvpHit` runs through the SAME magnitude cap (`_netDmg`) and per-SOURCE
rate bucket (`_netDmgBudget`, keyed to the VERIFIED sender `conn._pid`, never the claim) a host-addressed
hit gets, and an over-budget or non-positive claim is DROPPED rather than forwarded. The rule is the
inverse of a whitelist: only KNOWN damage types are mediated (`pvpHit` today), everything else
(fire/char/chat/nade/rocket visuals, race, hold) forwards verbatim — a whitelist would rot as new
cosmetics arrive and silently block them. `test-1205` executes the real forward branch with the real clamp
helpers: a 1e9 one-shot clamps to the cap, a 50-packet burst relays at most one window's PvP budget and
drops the rest, cosmetic relays pass verbatim, host-addressed hits still handle locally.

**The fresh panel's other findings are recorded for the roadmap, not yet built** (this build took the one
security-CRITICAL first). Ranked highlights, all VERIFIED-IN-CODE unless noted:
- *Rendering:* no SSR / parallax-corrected reflections (the 1186 probe is one spawn-point cubemap); the
  default "motion blur" is a brightness-keep afterimage, not velocity blur; no specular/temporal AA for the
  1139/1145 procedural normal maps; one adaptive downshift sheds SSAO + soft particles + soft shorelines
  together; unshadowed sun-in-fog term; water reflects a hardcoded blue; CSM split is a hard cut at ~120 m.
- *Gameplay feel:* NO positional audio anywhere (every sound is mono — the single largest feel gap); enemies
  have no stagger/flinch/hit-slow; gunshots are single synth blips (no layers/tail/sub-bass, no compressor);
  the hitmarker shows a false KILL marker on a non-lethal PvP headshot; no landing impact / sprint-FOV / lean
  on the first-person camera; random difficulty plateaus at wave 5 and shielded/charger never spawn from it.
- *Editor UX:* the logic graph is a black box (no live inspector, `do`-verb failures swallowed silently —
  route them to `levelIssues()`); events carry no identity/position/payload (the per-actor ceiling, same root
  as deferred per-player vars); no play-from-here / start-at-wave; props and lights are disjoint selections so
  a lamp+light composite can't be moved/prefabbed as a unit; first-hour editor onboarding is a manual not the
  do-to-advance pill 938 already proved; no align/distribute/array; terrain is a fixed 48×48 grid stretched
  over any arena size.
- *Performance:* the 1195 vertex-AO bake re-runs IN FULL on any `colliders.length` change — a logic-blinked
  door restarts it forever at 6 ms/frame (CRITICAL); two unbounded texture caches (`_texInst`, `texCache`)
  never evict or dispose across level swaps; enemy bolt trails allocate a Mesh+material clone per bolt per
  frame (1168's class, uncleared); the reflection probe re-renders the scene ×6 + PMREM every 3 s under the
  day cycle; `checkProximity` walks the full prop list ×5/frame; several always-on O(N) `loop()` scans.
- *Feature surface:* multiplayer is 8 hardcoded modes a creator can't extend (needs per-player/team logic
  scoping); no play-count/rating/comment flywheel (a `plays.php` sibling to `lobbies.php`); logic can't
  CREATE a prop at runtime (spawn-prop-by-prefab, 1170's deferred half — `_pfSpawnEntry` is ready); saves
  are one un-namespaced global bucket; every moving creature is hostile (no wandering NPC); day/night and
  weather are invisible to the logic graph.
- *Multiplayer/platform (beyond this build):* no connection cap or inbound rate limiting (one-line DoS +
  `pAdd` scene injection); fully client-authoritative hits with no lag comp / geometry validation; free
  shared-cred TURN is the only relay; no persistent identity / social graph; join-in-progress has no
  ack/retry if the forced keyframe drops.

## The arena arrives knowing its own gameplay (build 1204)

The generator roadmap's "emit gameplay data with the GLB" item, second piece (1124's `spawns` was the
first). `buildArena` now returns `game` beside `spawns`: **posts** — one patrol guard per ramp, standing at
the FOOT with the ramp centreline (SCANS, foot-first/top-second) as a ping-pong route, emitted directly in
`buildSpawnMarker`'s own opts shape so the engine consumes them with zero translation — and **pickups** —
candidate spots the layout says are open (the two mid-lanes, the two flanks, then each ramp's TOP last, so
the consumer's index-ordered kinds put the good guns on high ground). Never (0,0): every footprint puts a
structure at the centre (1124's undercroft lesson). The in-editor worker carries `game` back beside
`world`, and Place-in-level seeds both behind a default-on checkbox ("Seed gameplay: ramp guards + pickup
spots"), inside the model-load callback, with NO `clearAt` validation on purpose — the generator authored
these against its own geometry, and the big-GLB collider may still be deriving off-thread (1203) at that
moment, when the interim collider is fail-solid and would reject every honest spot. `test-1204` executes
the real generator (posts' routes must BE members of SCANS) and pins the wiring. The CLI prints a `GAME`
manifest beside `SCANS`/`SPAWNS`.

**SEVENTH container rollback, recovered mid-build — and this one carried news.** The bump assert fired
(atomic abort, nothing written), but the tree was not merely stale: **PR #30 had been merged** (at build
1198) and the container sat on the merged main, while origin's branch still held 1199-1203. Recovery per
the merged-PR protocol: fetch the branch, rebase its unmerged commits onto origin/main (clean — the merge
point is their ancestor), force-with-lease push, re-apply the aborted edits. The levelgen half of this
build survived in the working tree across the rollback; only the breach.html half needed re-applying.

## The collider grid derives off-thread (build 1203)

The perf critic's #5 other half. `buildModelGridBoxes` measured 110-137 ms on the main thread for a
level-sized GLB (1148's own numbers) — a guaranteed hitch on every big import, including MID-SESSION ones
(co-op level sync, the `local:` drop path). The derivation is now three pieces, and the split is the whole
design: `_mgridGatherTris` walks the scene (the only part that needs it; 1089's 2M-triangle cap intact),
**`_mgridCore` is a PURE function of a flat triangle array** — no THREE, no `MGRID_*`, no `IS_COARSE`, no
scratch vectors — and the worker runs `_mgridCore`'s own `toString()` from a Blob (the levelgen worker's
precedent). One implementation serves both threads, so the algorithm tests (1092/1113/1148/1159), which
EXECUTE the code on real geometry, keep guarding the exact source the worker runs; `test-1203` proves the
purity directly by executing the core in an empty scope on 1148's doorway repro (door open, wall solid,
lintel solid, deterministic, flat `Float32Array` output).

The async path lives in `refreshPropCollider`: models over `MGRID_SYNC_TRIS` (30k triangles) post their
gathered triangles to the worker by TRANSFER and get the boxes back by transfer; smaller models stay
synchronous because their derivation is cheaper than the round trip. While the answer is in flight the prop
keeps per-mesh AABBs — the pre-grid, fail-SOLID behaviour: a building is briefly over-solid, never
walk-through. Delivery is token-guarded (`_mgridTok` bumps on every re-derivation, so an in-flight answer
for the OLD transform can never land) and a landed grid re-teaches the spatial grid (`_cgDirty`, 1188) and
the nav grid (`_navDirtyProp`, 1200). Physics needs nothing: the Rapier statics are trimeshes of the real
triangles, not `userData.boxes`. Failure degrades, never opens: a dead worker fails every pending job to
null (per-mesh boxes stand) and future derivations go synchronous; a failed `postMessage` RE-GATHERS before
the sync fallback because the transfer may already have consumed the buffer.

The old single function's history comments (1089 budgets, 1092 clipping, 1148 footprints, the widening
that shipped wrong twice) ride with the piece they describe — the core's text is the pre-1203 code with the
vertex reads renamed, moved by string surgery rather than retyped. Six test files moved with the split
(06 passed untouched; 1089, 1092, 1093, 1113, 1148, 142, 1159 — harnesses now concatenate the split
functions; every assertion kept its intent, and the executable ones kept their exact numbers).

## The pursuit remembers which storey (build 1202)

Build 1200's recorded other half, closed: PvE enemies pathed to layer A because `enemyDesiredTarget`
returned `{tx,tz}` with no height and `en.lkp` stored none — an enemy chasing a player on a roof pathed to
the floor underneath them. The descriptor now carries `ty` through exactly the five chase/contact/search
returns (counted by the test), `en.lkp` stores the height the target was SEEN at (the memory includes which
storey), the caller feeds `near.pos.y`, and the follow-path call hands `td.ty` to 1200's goal-layer pick.
Patrol/wander/hold returns stay height-less BY DESIGN — a post and a wander point are ground concepts and
layer A is the right default there. Three pins moved (17, 283, 406), each keeping its intent.

## The match survives the host (build 1201)

The multiplayer critic's remaining CRITICAL: the host vanishing mid-match reloaded every client's page 1.6
seconds later. Now `netHostLost` migrates instead — only a lobby-phase loss (nothing worth saving) or a
migration that itself times out (40 s) takes the old reload road, which lives on as `_migFail`.

Four decisions carry the design:
- **The election has no round to lose.** Every peer already holds the same roster from the snapshots, so
  `_migRank(myId, playerIds)` computes the SAME deterministic order everywhere (sorted ids, the dead host's
  id 0 excluded, iteration-order independent — tested). Rank 0 promotes immediately; rank r attempts to
  JOIN the migrated room every 2.5 s and only CLAIMS it after r×4 s — so a dead rank (a bot's id in the
  roster, a double-drop) delays the cascade, never deadlocks it. Losing the claim race returns
  `unavailable-id`, which demotes the loser cleanly to client of whoever won. A lone survivor is rank 0:
  a co-op partner closing their laptop promotes you instantly and the match simply continues.
- **The migrated room lives at a DERIVED peer id** — `_migPid(code, gen)` = `breachfps-<code>-m<gen>` —
  because the dead host's own id can stay reserved at the PeerJS broker long past our window; claiming a
  fresh deterministic id beats racing a timeout we don't control. Every peer bumps `NET.migGen` once per
  observed loss, so a second migration derives the same `-m2` everywhere. Cost, recorded: the room vanishes
  from the lobby directory (no keepalive re-registration) and NEW joiners can't find the migrated session —
  migration serves the players already in it.
- **State comes from the last snapshot.** `_migAdoptMirrors` promotes the client mirrors to the
  authoritative arrays: enemies respawn through the real `spawnEnemy` at their mirrored positions with the
  type+hp that KEYFRAMES now carry (`o.ty`/`o.hp`, keyframes only — the delta key is unchanged, so 1197's
  bandwidth win survives; the mirror remembers them, plus `_puKind` on powerup meshes), hp clamped to the
  type's max, a pre-1201 mirror demoting to grunt rather than failing. Coins and powerups keep their
  network ids (clients already hold meshes under them) and the id fountains advance past them. ALL
  remote-player entries drop at promotion — rejoiners re-appear on their first state message; the dead host
  and bots never do. Chests are already real objects on a client and simply stay.
- **Rejoiners keep their identity.** The old id rides the connection METADATA (available before 'open', so
  the welcome and every score/team lookup are right from the first byte); `_hostOnConnection` honours it
  when free and the fountain never falls behind. The rejoin welcome is inert on arrival (`NET.joined`
  guards a re-startGame) except an id rebind when the old id was taken, and skips the level serialization —
  the rejoiner is already standing in the level. Scores (`NET.duelScore`), teams and KOTH state are client
  mirrors already, so the promoted host inherits them by doing nothing.

Two literals died on the way: the host is **not id 0** anymore — the snapshot's self-entry is
`id:NET.myId`, the third-party relay check compares `msg.to !== NET.myId`, and the welcome keys the host's
character by a new `hid` field. All three are 0 for an original host, so nothing moved for existing play.
`_hostOnConnection` is one factored function attached by BOTH `hostStart` and `_migPromote` (counted in the
test) — the 1158 lesson, applied before the drift instead of after.

**Honest limits, recorded not hidden:** logic-graph variable state and PvP bots are host-local and do not
migrate; the objective timers migrate at snapshot resolution (0.1 s). `test-1201` executes the election and
the whole adoption path and pins every wiring point. NOT verifiable headless: a real two-machine
drop-the-host session — that is a browser pass with two devices.

## The nav grid learns a second storey (build 1200)

The critic roadmap's multi-storey AI item. The grid stored ONE walkable Y per column, so a cell under a roof
was the floor or the roof, never both — bots and enemies could not path onto any upper surface, ever. Now a
column carries up to two floors: layer A is EXACTLY the floor the grid always chose (the safe-change rule —
no existing behaviour moved), and layer B is the column's highest surface, kept only when it clears layer A
by `NAV_LAYER_SEP` (2.2 m of headroom) and passes the SAME `clearAt` authority. Node id = `cellIdx +
N*layer`, so every layer-A id is byte-identical to the old cell ids and `navCellCenter` decodes both. The
link mask went `Uint8Array(N)` → `Uint16Array(2N)`: bit d = a link in direction d, bit d+8 = that link lands
on the target cell's LAYER B, with the target layer chosen per direction as the one vertically closest
inside the `[-NAV_DOWN, +NAV_UP]` window. **Stairs fall out with no special case** — a rising layer-A floor
links into a neighbour's layer B the moment it is within jump reach, and the tie-break prefers layer A on an
exact tie (a landing must be CLOSER to the storey than to the ground to route up, which is what a real
landing is). A*, flood, components and the overlay all run over 2N nodes; the overlay draws layer B in amber.

`navNearestWalkable(x,z,y)` grew the optional height: with a y, the layer whose floor is nearest wins, so an
actor standing upstairs paths on its own storey. Starts pass the actor's y everywhere (`_botRepath` — bots
AND the PvE enemies' `en._nav` adapter share it); goals carry a height only where one is in scope today,
which is the bot AI (`destY = tgt.pos.y` — a bot will climb to a player camping a roof). **PvE enemies still
path to layer A goals**: `enemyDesiredTarget` returns `{tx,tz}` with no height and `en.lkp` stores none, so
threading the target's y through those descriptor sites is the recorded other half, not an oversight.

DIRTY PATCHES close the second old hole: the grid was built at match start and never noticed the world
changing, so a moved bridge or destroyed wall left paths routing through phantom geometry. Prop verbs
(show/hide/move — move marks OLD and NEW footprints) and `shatterProp` (which the del verb rides, and which
also fires for a shot barrel) mark their bbox via `navDirtyRect`; both AI frame loops run `navDirtyStep(3)`
once the grid is built — a budgeted re-sample of just those cells through the same `navWalkable`, then ONE
`navBuildLinks()` when the queue drains (a few ms at the 160×160 cap; incremental link surgery would be
cheaper and subtly wrong). A queue past 64 rects collapses to one full re-sample. Paths self-heal on their
own repath cadence (~0.5–1 s), so no consumer needs notifying.

`test-1200` drives the REAL extracted functions over a mock two-storey world: two layers where earned (and
NOT where not), a ground→roof path that climbs via the landing with every step inside the jump window, the
return trip, a floor goal that never detours over the roof, storey selection by height, and the dirty-patch
chain — shatter the stair, re-sample, and the roof goes unreachable in O(1) (comp reject) while the ground
keeps pathing. Seven pins moved (282, 347, 352, 355, 356, 359, 473), each keeping its assertion's intent;
473 is the build-619 roof test and still proves the roof does not hijack the floor — layer B is additive.

## The sky that was flashing was never in the frame — it was in the G-buffer (build 1199)

Reported from play, refining 1198's report: auto-exposure behaves until **ambient occlusion is turned up**,
then the HDRI sky flickers badly. 1198's soft knee was real and stays — but the driver was AO. The 1152 rule
("nothing that does not write depth belongs in a depth-derived buffer") arrived by a FIFTH door, and this one
the sweep structurally cannot cover: **`scene.background` is not a scene object.** `overrideMaterial` never
replaces it and `_aoHideNoDepth` traverses children, so an HDRI sky — a background TEXTURE (`scene.background
= tex`; the procedural dome nulls the background instead, which is why only HDRI mode shows this) — rendered
its tone-mapped colours straight into the half-res G-buffer. Those colours pass the geometric sky test
(channel sum ≥ 0.63 reads as a packed normal) and carry an alpha SSAO reads as a surface about a unit from
the camera, so the whole sky was shaded as a wall. And because the background pass tone-maps with
`toneMappingExposure` (pinned against the real build in test-1198 and again in 1199), **every easing step of
auto-exposure rewrote the garbage** — AE modulated it, AO made it visible, which is exactly "AE works until
AO goes up". Fix: the prepass saves `scn.background`, nulls it for BOTH G-buffer renders (the viewmodel pass
draws into the same buffer), and restores it before the AO resolve — beside the dome hide, so the two halves
of "no sky of either kind in the G-buffer" live in one place. `test-1199` pins the ordering, the
no-return-between-null-and-restore property, and both premises.

The count is now five arrivals of one rule: 1126 the sky dome, 1128 the weather points, 1152 the flipbook
sprites (rule stated), 1158 the viewmodel muzzle flash (rule applied to the second caller), 1199 the
background (content the rule's sweep cannot see). If a sixth appears, ask what ELSE the renderer draws that
is not a child of the scene.

## The meter was stalling the pipeline it was measuring (build 1182)

Reported from play the day 1180 shipped: **any auto-exposure strength above 0 produced visible stutter on
all visuals, with no fps drop.** That signature — time lost with the frame counter unmoved — is a pipeline
STALL, not a load: `readRenderTargetPixels` is synchronous, so every 5th frame the CPU drained the entire
queued GPU frame before copying 1 KB. A 12Hz judder the fps counter cannot see, because the time went to
waiting, not working. (Strength 0 was smooth, which is what implicated the readback: the blit is a 16×16
draw and the easing is arithmetic — the sync read was the only candidate left.)

The metering now lives in `_aeMeter()` and reads back asynchronously: `readPixels` into a
`PIXEL_PACK_BUFFER` (returns immediately), `fenceSync` behind it, and a harvest that polls
`clientWaitSync(fence, 0, **0**)` — timeout zero, so the poll can never become the very block it replaces.
The pixels arrive a few frames late, which a ~1s eased eye cannot show. Four details that are each a bug
if lost:
- **One read in flight at a time** (`!_aeFence && (++_aeFrame % 5)===0`) — issuing over a pending read
  would need a PBO ring for nothing; the cadence just skips a beat.
- **`PIXEL_PACK_BUFFER` is unbound immediately** — three's own `readRenderTargetPixels` (cine preview,
  thumbnails, captures) would otherwise write into our PBO instead of its client array.
- **WebGL1 has no PBO/fence: the meter is gated on `capabilities.isWebGL2` and auto-exposure goes quietly
  INERT there** — a missing feature beats reintroducing the stutter on the devices least able to hide it.
- **Strength 0 mid-flight deletes the pending fence**; `WAIT_FAILED` and a thrown call (context loss) drop
  the GL objects and fall back to neutral, and the next 5th frame re-issues.

`test-1182` drives the real extracted `_aeMeter` with a stub GL through all of it — including a renderer
stub whose `readRenderTargetPixels` THROWS, so the sync path cannot quietly come back — and pins that every
`clientWaitSync` in it passes timeout 0. Worth generalising: the engine's other readbacks (cine preview
window, level thumbnails) are user-initiated one-offs where a stall is invisible; anything that reads the
GPU back **every frame or on a cadence** must use this pattern.

## Soft particles, and smoke that knows what time it is (build 1183)

A flipbook quad slicing through world geometry drew a hard line across the intersection — the classic
billboard artifact, on the biggest sprites in the game (explosions grow to ~4m). The AO G-buffer (1126)
already holds the scene's view distance at half res, swept clean of everything that doesn't write depth
(1152/1158) — **including these very sprites** — so it is exactly the "world behind the particle" a soft
fade needs, for free. `_softSprite(mat, band)` patches `SpriteMaterial` via `onBeforeCompile` (a patched
built-in, per 1145 — never a raw ShaderMaterial), fading `diffuseColor.a` over a band that scales with the
sprite (30% of its size). Uniforms are shared BY REFERENCE (1181's trick — but assigned into
`shader.uniforms` directly in `onBeforeCompile`, which does not have 1181's ShaderLib-merge problem).

The details that are each a bug if lost:
- **A cleared G-buffer texel is SKY and must read as INFINITELY FAR** (`(r+g+b) < 0.3 ? 1e6 : a` — 1126's
  geometric test). Without it, every sprite fades out against the sky.
- **The fade reads LAST frame's buffer** (the prepass runs after the scene pass). One frame of lag on a
  fade band is invisible; sampling this frame's buffer is impossible anyway.
- **Gated on the same `_aoWant` that keeps the buffer fresh**, fed beside it; the plain render path (post
  off) writes the gate OFF, or sprites would sample a frozen buffer. AO off = hard edges, never stale data.
- **Muzzle is deliberately HARD, and viewmodel sprites are never softened** — a flash lives centimetres
  from a gun; the geometry behind it is at nearly its own depth, so a soft fade only dims every shot.
- **`customProgramCacheKey` is a constant and `warmFlipbookShaders` compiles the soft variant at load** —
  the first explosion must not compile a new program mid-combat (the 622/1153 freeze, by a new door).
- **Both `replace()` anchors are pinned against the REAL three build** in `test-1183` — a renamed chunk
  makes a string-replace a silent no-op, which is how 1181 nearly shipped nothing.

Scene-lit smoke: the smoke sheet is unlit white, so it GLOWED at night. `lit:true` scales the material
colour by `0.30 + 0.70*dayF` at spawn — luminance only, floored so it never goes black, exactly 1 when the
day cycle is off (so no existing level changes by a single code value unless it uses the cycle).

## The water joins the colour pipeline (build 1184)

The water surface, the waterfall sheets and the plunge foam were the last raw ShaderMaterials writing
straight `gl_FragColor` — no ACES, no exposure, no fog. So water ignored the filmic response, the creator's
exposure, 1180's auto-exposure and 1181's height fog: a lake at dusk sat at its own private brightness
inside a fogged, graded frame. Each now applies the SHARED `_ACES_GLSL` (the dome's `uTM`/`uExpo` pair —
`uTM 0` returns the input untouched, so filmic-off is byte-identical to the old shader) and ends in the
engine's own `fog_fragment` chunk, tone-map before fog, three's own order.

The mechanism worth keeping: **`material.fog = true` on a ShaderMaterial makes three refresh
`fogColor`/`fogDensity` per frame — but it writes into uniforms the material must already HAVE, and throws
on one that doesn't.** `_waterFogUniforms()` supplies the set once for all four materials: fog colour +
density with real initial values, plus `fogSunDirW`/`fogHeightP` riding 1181's shared plain objects by
reference (one CPU write reaches the water too), plus `uTM`/`uExpo`. The vertex shaders write
`vFogDepth`/`vFogWorldPos` directly under `#ifdef USE_FOG` — the shared `fog_vertex` chunk needs
`transformed`, which these shaders don't have (the sprite lesson from 1181, applied preemptively).

The surface also gains a soft SHORELINE: 1183's G-buffer read (sharing the same `_SOFT_GEO`/`_SOFT_P`
uniform wrappers outright), fading the disc's rim over ~0.7 m where the ground sits just behind the
surface along the view ray. `vVZ` is view-Z — the same quantity the buffer stores; a euclidean distance
would tilt the band with view angle. Same freshness gate: AO off = the old hard rim, never stale depth.

Exposure is read LIVE (`renderer.toneMappingExposure` = base × auto), so the water breathes with 1180's
eye adaptation instead of ignoring it. Two pins moved (868 — sheets/foam still dim with `uLight`, now
inside `_aces(...)`; 858 — a `{0,1600}` window widened to 2400, anchor unchanged). NOT capture-verified:
water needs a browser pass — the zone panel, a waterfall, dusk with the day cycle, and the shoreline with
AO on and off.

## Two-cascade sun shadows (build 1185)

The rendering critic's #1 CRITICAL, and the oldest visible defect in the engine: one shadow volume was a
trade with no right answer — tight (build 1120's fit) gives sharp contacts and a HARD CLIFF where shadows
end ("the world floats" past `shadowDist`); wide gives no cliff and mud everywhere. Now the near volume
stays exactly 1120's camera-following fit and **`moonFar`** — a second directional light, seated at BOOT
because the light count must never change during play (636/977/1153/1155), desktop only — covers **4×**
that extent behind it. Each fragment takes the sun from exactly ONE cascade.

The pick is by COVERAGE, not by a split distance: a chunk patch after `getDirectionalLightInfo` reads the
near map's own projected coord (`vDirectionalShadowCoord[0]`, 2% margin) — a derived split distance gets
the screen corners wrong (they leave the near volume laterally before they leave it in depth); the coord
cannot be wrong about what the map covers. Three guards, each load-bearing:
- **`#if NUM_DIR_LIGHT_SHADOWS >= 2`** keeps the gate out of every scene that isn't running the cascades —
  the thumbnail/inspector rigs are two-directional-light setups whose rim light this must not touch.
- **`USE_SHADOWMAP` absent** (an object with `receiveShadow=false` — the nocollide grass) cannot read the
  coord; it takes the NEAR sun unshadowed. Without that branch such objects receive BOTH suns = 2× light.
- **`csmSunP.y`** (shared plain object; the value walked into every merged lit `ShaderLib` entry — 1181's
  lesson, reproven in `test-1185`) is the runtime switch: 0 on phones, where a creator's own two
  shadow-casting directionals could otherwise trip the compiled gate.

The far fit lives inside `_fitSunShadow`: snapped to its OWN 4×-coarser texel grid (snapping to the near
grid would slide it a fraction of its own texel per step — `test-1185` proves whole-texel movement along
the fit's own axes); the light stands `D = 90 + F` back so the whole ±F volume fits its depth range (a
light left on the 90 orbit would spill ~110 units behind itself at F=240); `normalBias` is 1125's texel
rule at the far map's own scale with its own cap (the near 0.6 cap is a near-volume quantity — clamping
the far bias to it would acne every distant surface). Colour/intensity/visibility mirror `moon` every call
BEFORE the early return, because the day cycle writes them per frame. Sun→scene direction is measured
target-relative (`moon.position - _sunTarget.position`) — `normalize(moon.position)` is only the light
direction when the target sits at the origin, which 1120's own snap axes still assume (pre-existing,
harmless for a grid, left alone).

Costs and residue, stated plainly: every shadow refresh now renders two maps (desktop only); the cliff
still exists at 4× `shadowDist` (240 m default) — SSAO and distance carry past that; the cascade seam can
show a resolution step. NOT capture-verified — the browser pass should walk a big generated arena and look
for the seam, distant acne, and grass brightness (the 2×-light guard). One harness moved (1120 — its
scope gained the null `moonFar`, so it now drives the phone path; 1185 drives the far cascade).

## The scene reflection probe, and the capture that was measuring build 1156 (build 1186)

`scene.environment` was the SKY alone — a chrome sphere in a courtyard reflected bare sky through the
walls around it. The probe now renders the REAL scene from the spawn's eye into a 128 cube at deploy (two
shots: +1.2s and +9s, for slow assets), inverts the ACES that is baked into every material's program
(switching `renderer.toneMapping` off to render clean would RECOMPILE every shader — the 636/977/1153
freeze), PMREMs the result, and supersedes the sky-only probe in `applySky`. The inverse matrices are the
numeric inverses of `_ACESin`/`_ACESout`; `test-1186` re-derives them from the forward pair in the source
(1151's pattern) and round-trips the full fit to 1e-3. Values ACES clipped past ~1.0 are unrecoverable —
probe highlights saturate where the frame's did. Phones keep the sky-only probe; an authored HDRI outranks
everything; the day cycle rebuilds at most every 3s.

**First: every capture this stretch had been measuring build 1156.** `drive.mjs` serves
`scratchpad/head.html` — a SNAPSHOT — and the byte-identical frame means that "verified" builds 1181-1185
were the snapshot agreeing with itself. Build 1124 said know where the camera is; 1151 said know what
surface you are measuring; the completion is **know what BUILD you are measuring** — stamp it or diff it.
`head.html` must be refreshed from the repo before any capture run.

The real captures then found two shipped bugs in this very build:
- **The dome followed `cam.position` — a CubeCamera's face cameras are CHILDREN, local position (0,0,0).**
  So the dome teleported to the world origin for every probe face and the probe rendered a BLACK sky.
  Found by reading the probe's own cube back (sky face 11/255 where ~180 belongs) — the frame alone only
  showed the symptom: the env-lit viewmodel crushed to 0,0,0 (the weapon's fill IS the environment —
  `_drawViewmodel` mirrors `scene.environment` into `vmScene`). Fixed with `getWorldPosition` into a
  scratch vector; every camera the engine will ever render through now carries the dome correctly.
- **Scaling the whole probe by `worldCfg.sky` was wrong, measured twice over.** Geometry radiance already
  contains the sun and the sky-scaled ambient — scaling it again dimmed every reflection 3× (weapon region
  70,74,67 vs 95,101,94; whole frame −8). The scale now applies to the SKY ALONE, at the dome, during the
  cube pass (`_spSkyScale`, restored in a `finally`): sky pixels match the old probe exactly, geometry
  passes at 1.

Measured residue, stated plainly: whole frame 134,146,150 → 129,141,147 (−3.7%) because the probe's lower
hemisphere is the level's REAL ground radiance rather than the sky model's brighter painted band — a
physically honest shift; and the weapon reads blue-steel (region 95,101,94 → 75,82,80): its top rail
carries the sky, its sides the ground, which is what reflecting the world means for the one metal object
always on screen. Auto-exposure separately measured +22 code values on this frame (its dead-zone does not
hold at the stock frame's log-average — worth knowing when comparing captures across 1180).

Three pins moved (1119, 1127 — dome-follow and dome-exposure took the new forms; 1186's own uScale pin).

## LUT colour grade (build 1187) — and a Phase-3 item that died on verification

The roadmap item was "creator texture slots on primitives + LUT grade". The first half is DEAD ON
VERIFICATION: primitives have had full texture slots since the 871 era — `applyPropTexture` (albedo),
`texN`/`texR` PBR maps, per-prop tiling (`texRepeat`) and rotation (`texRot`), a web texture picker
(`applyPropTexturePBR`), all serialised through `p.mat`. Same lesson as the raycast-BVH claim (1159):
every critic claim is a hypothesis until the grep comes back.

The LUT grade is real and shipped. A standard N*N × N strip (256×16 or 1024×32 — the Unreal/GTA
convention, green DOWN each tile, blue across tiles) applies in the composite immediately after
contrast/saturation and before vignette/grain — the frame is DISPLAY-REFERRED there (1117 moved the grade
after the encode), which is exactly what LUT strips are authored against, so no transfer math exists to
get wrong. Decisions that are each a bug if lost:
- **Loaded RAW** — an sRGB tag would decode the texels and corrupt a display-to-display mapping. `flipY`
  off so the green axis is deterministic; no mips (a mip of a LUT is a different grade); clamp wrapping;
  bilinear does the in-tile r/g interpolation and two taps mix across the blue tiles.
- **Half-texel insets** keep red=1 on the LAST texel centre of its own tile — `test-1187` drives the exact
  formula against a JS identity strip (returns its input to 1/60) and pins the no-tile-bleed corners.
- **Absent = amount 0** (`_lutMap ? _postLutAmt : 0`): no LUT, a failed load, or a rejected image is
  EXACTLY the old grade, never a black lookup. Rejection is loud and validates `width === height²`.
- The loader counts `_texPending` (the level loading gate), survives url races (a stale load that lost is
  disposed, not applied), and clearing the url disposes. `worldCfg.lut`/`lutAmt` ride the whole-object
  world serialisation for free; the UI is a `texRow` + strength slider beside the grade sliders, with a
  hint describing the standard workflow (screenshot → grade with a neutral strip in any editor → crop →
  host → paste).

**FIFTH container rollback recovered during this build** — same signature (BUILD_VERSION regressed to 1182,
`git log` at the old HEAD), caught by a scripted edit's own anchor assert (the bump expected 1186 and found
1182 — and because the script writes only at the end, the mismatch aborted it atomically). All of 1183-1186
were already pushed; recovery was one fetch + reset, and the 1187 re-apply was free. The capture snapshot
(`scratchpad/head.html`) must be re-copied after any rollback recovery too.

## The collider grid (build 1188) — PHASE 4 OPENS

Build 1148's tight collider tripled the box count (795 → 2,291 on a 3-storey block) and every hot query
still walked the WHOLE collider list: the per-enemy obstacle resolve, per-bolt hit tests, `segmentBlocked`
(AI line-of-sight), `_surfCull` under every bot, `clearAt`/`ceilingAt`/`insideSolid`. An 8m XZ hash over
each collider's overall box (`_cgQuery`) turns those walks into a few cell lookups. Eight consumers
converted — with **byte-identical loop bodies**: the grid replaces only where candidates come from, never
what is done with them, and `test-1188` proves the superset property (300 random queries, zero misses vs
the linear walk) rather than trusting the hash.

The design decisions that carry the correctness:
- **Movers are never hashed.** A physics body, a running xa animation, a kinematic body, or a collider
  with no box yet lives in a side list appended to EVERY query — their boxes change per frame, and
  re-hashing movers per frame would cost more than the walk ever did.
- **Classification self-heals through the stale flag.** A static prop that starts moving dirties the grid
  on its first `refreshPropCollider` (its stamp still says static), one rebuild reclassifies it, and after
  that its per-frame refreshes are stamp-guarded and rebuild nothing. Adds/removes are caught by a length
  check, so no push/splice site needs to know the grid exists; the one same-length swap site (the power
  station) calls `refreshPropCollider` and is caught by the flag.
- **One scratch array per consumer.** `clearAt` calls `surfaceTopAt` (through `_surfCull`) before its own
  query; a shared scratch would be clobbered the day that order matters (1168's rule).
- **A query rect must cover the consumer's own coarse-reject margin** (`clearAt` ±R, the enemy resolve
  ±eR, `_surfCull` ±0.3, point tests ±CB_EPS) — that is what makes the superset exact. `segmentBlocked`
  queries the segment's bbox: a crossed box contains a sample point, and every sample lies on the segment.
- Outside ±4096 the key clamps into edge cells — conservative, never wrong.

Three harnesses moved (32, 303 — pass-through `_cgQuery` injected, the 1122 precedent: those tests are
about the blocking logic, not candidate sourcing; 32's cover pin now names the grid).

## Ranged enemies use the level (build 1189)

PvP bots have hunted, flanked and broken for cover since 1003-1006; PvE gunners held a standoff ring and
strafed — competent, but they never USED the level. The port takes the bot brain's two best moves:
- **Cover break.** A hit that drops a gunner under its bravery fraction (0.30-0.45, rolled per individual
  so a squad doesn't break in unison) sends it to real cover for a ~2.5s beat, then it re-engages; a 9s
  cooldown stops it turtling. **Cover is a BEAT, not a state** — PvE enemies don't heal, so a health-gated
  state (the bots' shape) would turtle forever; the trigger is EDGE-based (hp dropped this frame), which
  `test-1189` replays. `_botFindCover` is reused VERBATIM through a `{pos:{x,y,z}}` shim — it only reads
  `.pos`, proven by driving it with enemy-shaped input. Firing already requires `_see`, so cover going up
  silences the gun with no extra gate. No cover found (open field) = the trigger simply never fires.
- **Flank.** With the player unseen, the gunner approaches the last-known spot from a side angle — the
  bots' exact 0.7-radian / 5-metre shape, pinned as shared between both AIs. This also removes a quiet
  wallhack: the old block steered toward the player's LIVE position even when unseen.

The gunner opts in (`cover:true`); the BOSS deliberately does not (a boss doesn't cower); melee types are
untouched — closing is their whole design. The original standoff/strafe body survives byte-identical as
the seen-and-healthy branch. The roadmap item's "+ trace bot bullets" half is deferred to its own build.

## The weapon stat sheet (build 1190) — and two roadmap halves that died on verification

Verification kills first, recorded so they stay dead:
- **"Trace bot bullets"** — `remoteFire` has drawn the tracer, impact spark, decal, muzzle flash and
  positional audio for every bot shot since build 1020.
- **"Cell-hash the enemy separation"** — the pass is O(N²) but waves cap at ~40-60, so it is ~1,800 pairs
  of a half-dozen float ops per frame. Arithmetic, not a hotspot; the collider walks 1188 removed were the
  real cost.

The real gap: damage has been per-level since 623, but fire rate, magazine, start/max ammo, spread,
reload and pellets were engine constants — "every level plays the same seven guns". They now follow
damage's exact pattern: `GUN_BASE` (the factory baseline, captured from the live table at boot), only
CHANGED values serialized (an `st` object per weapon, diffed against base), all three loaders (boot, net,
restore) applying through **one clamped helper** (`_wepApplyStats`) so a hostile level file cannot set a
0ms fire rate or 10,000 pellets through any door — clamps proven executable in `test-1190`. Weapons a
level does not mention reset to factory (net + restore), so tuning never leaks between levels. The editor
exposes the sheet under the gun's damage row (guns only — fists have no magazine), writing through the
same helper, each field with a reset-to-factory button.

**Found and fixed on the way: `startGame`'s ammo reset was four hardcoded lines covering four of seven
guns** — the pistol and launcher carried spent ammo across runs since build 976. The reset is now a loop
over every gun's (possibly authored) sheet; `test-1190` executes it and proves the four old guns get
byte-identical values at factory settings while the pistol finally resets too. Four pins moved (227, 229,
476, 530 — the reducer gained `st`, the reset became the loop; each keeps its assertion's intent).

## Per-level enemy tuning (build 1191)

The wave manifest (1179) authors COMPOSITION; the stat sheet (1190) authors the guns; the enemies
themselves were engine constants. Each type's hp, damage and speed are now level-authorable through the
1190 pattern: `ENEMY_BASE` captured at boot, `gameCfg.enemyMods` carrying only-changed values, ONE clamped
sanitizer (`_sanitizeEnemyMods`) on every path in AND out — boot, both loaders, and the SERIALIZER, so
nothing out-of-range ever enters a share code (hp floor 1, dmg cap 999, speed 0.25-3×). Speed is a
MULTIPLIER of the type's min and max together, so gait variance survives tuning. Application is at SPAWN
TIME via `_enemyEff(typeKey)` in the one factory, so formula waves, manifests and placed spawns all
inherit it with zero extra plumbing. The editor grid lives in the waves fold beside the manifests; each
field's placeholder is its factory value, so blank visibly means factory. Three pins moved (21, 33, 62 —
the factory line and the game-serializer window; intents kept). "Factions" (enemies fighting each other)
is deliberately NOT this build — it needs a targeting rework, its own build.

## Imported models instance (build 1192)

Primitives have batched since before 1139; every imported GLB copy still walked its whole subtree per
frame — fifty trees were fifty draw hierarchies. Eligible model props now collapse into one
`InstancedMesh` per (geometry, material) part of the group's first member, matrices
`memberWorld × (templateWorld⁻¹ × partWorld)` so per-member position/rotation/scale all ride the root —
the multiply order is EXECUTED against the real three build in `test-1192` for a rotated+scaled member,
because a transposed order produces plausible frames that are wrong only for rotated copies.

Eligibility is decoration-grade ONLY, mirroring `instanceEligible`'s contract: physics, vehicles, running
animations, tags (the prop verbs), interact/dialogue/NPC, signals, locks, and adopted model lights all
disqualify (ten conditions, each executed in the test); a skinned or lit subtree disqualifies at batch
time, as does a >24-part model (one draw per part — a hundred-part model is not a batching win). Model
batches need ≥3 copies. They SHARE the template's live geometry/materials (the template returns to the
editor on teardown), so batch teardown is flagged not to dispose them. Same lists, same lifecycle, same
teardown as the primitive path.

Verified rather than assumed: **r149's `InstancedMesh` constructor ships `frustumCulled=false`** — a batch
spread across the map is never wrongly culled and no engine code was needed; the fact is pinned so an
upgrade that changes the default fails a test instead of blinking props out at screen edges. 1139's
raycast signature (an instanced hit reports the shared geometry with a correct world point) now applies
to model batches too.

## Effect zones (build 1193)

The zone toolbox had one effect per tool — death kills, fire burns, water swims, pads launch; a healing
fountain, a tar pit, a speed lane or a moon-gravity court was unauthorable. One new tool (`fxZones`,
✨ Effect in the zones tab) carries five effects with an audience (players / enemies / both):
- **Composition is strongest-wins for the multipliers** (haste `max`, slow/low-grav `min`) and **summing
  for the rates** (heal/hurt hp/sec) — overlapping zones compose sanely instead of multiplying into
  absurdity. Slow floors at 0.15× (bog, never freeze); every field clamps in `_migrateFxZone` so a
  hostile file cannot ship a 1e9-amount zone.
- **Speed rides the existing multiplier chains**: the player's target speed (through 1171's acceleration
  model, so it has mass), and the bots'/enemies' water-slow sites. **Low gravity is the water-swim
  pattern** (undo part of THIS frame's gravity). **Hurt is fire's exact tick/accumulator** with the same
  PvP/PvE damage split; heal is whole-hp granular. Enemy effects run host-side only.
- Serialized like every zone, migrated in both loaders, editor-only cylinder cues coloured per kind,
  full panel (add-at-me, kind/audience dropdowns, amount/radius/Y/height).

## Incremental Rapier statics (build 1194)

A GLB finishing its load after deploy triggered `buildPhysWorld()` — destroy the WHOLE world, rebuild the
terrain trimesh, every static trimesh (the documented multi-second stall), every dynamic body, every
joint and the character controller — once per load burst, for one new static prop. Statics are now
STAMPED with their body (`_physStatic`; the kinematic branches already had `_kbody`),
`addStaticColliderFor` is idempotent on the stamps (executed in `test-1194`: triple-add creates one
body), and the debounced late-load tick walks the collider list adding only what is missing into the
LIVE world. A dynamic prop missing its body still forces the full rebuild — its joints may reference
other bodies — and `destroyPhysWorld` clears the stamps so a stale one can never make the next full
build skip real work.

**The stamp exposed and fixed a real 1170-era bug:** `hideprop` removed a static prop's collider from
the query list but left its Rapier body — an invisible physics wall that dynamic props bounced off.
Hide now removes the body; show restores it through the same idempotent door. Two pins moved (125, 495 —
destroy-clears and the debounce tick; intents kept).

## Baked ambient occlusion for creator levels (build 1195)

The rendering critic's #2 CRITICAL, closed at its realistic scope. A hand-built interior was lit as if
outdoors — the hemisphere fill, the environment probe and the bounce all arrive at full strength inside a
windowless room, with only SSAO dissenting. Generated arenas have a real lightmap; creator levels
(arbitrary GLBs — no UV2 to bake into) get the PER-VERTEX version: every static-prop vertex casts a
14-ray golden-angle hemisphere, its colour becomes `0.35 + 0.65 × skyVisibility`, and
`vertexColors = true` multiplies it in. Occluders split by COST: every OTHER collider tests as its
overall box (a slab test over the 1188 grid's candidates — a primitive-built room's walls are separate
props, so boxes ARE its geometry), while the vertex's OWN model — the roof that makes an interior an
interior — tests real triangles through the 1097 BVH. A 0.15 ray near-clip keeps a vertex from being
shadowed by its own wall's box; self's collider boxes are skipped outright (triangles, never its own fat
box). All executed in `test-1195` against real three geometry.

The job is frame-budgeted (6 ms/frame), gated on `_glbPending`, re-requested when the collider count
changes (a late-loading GLB must not stay unbaked), and `worldCfg.baked` rides the whole-world
serialization so a shared level re-bakes deterministically wherever it opens — the bake itself is NEVER
serialized. Two invariants that are each a black-mesh bug if lost:
- **Copies of one GLB share geometry** — the bake writes into a private marker-guarded clone.
- **`vertexColors=true` on a shared material** demands a colour attribute on EVERY mesh using it (a
  missing attribute samples 0,0,0): after the bake, any unbaked sharer (a dynamic copy of a static
  model) gets an all-white attribute; and the primitive instancing batch STRIPS `vertexColors` from its
  material clone, because its shared unit geometry has no attribute at all.

Checkbox in the Lighting fold ("Baked ambient occlusion (per-vertex)"); off = clean unbake. Limitation
stated in the hint: a plain box only darkens at its corners — per-vertex is only as good as the
tessellation. NOT capture-verified; the browser pass is a windowless primitive room and a GLB interior,
baked and unbaked. One pin moved (1188's consumer count — the bake is the grid's ninth consumer).

## Cutscene shot events (build 1196) — the sequencer is the logic graph

The features critic wanted actor tracks. Instead of a parallel keyframe system, every cinematic shot
gains ONE field: `ev` — a named logic event fired the moment the shot starts (the first shot fires from
`startCinematic`, every later one on its hard cut). The graph's `event` nodes then do the acting with
verbs the engine already has: `moveprop` walks a tagged actor to its mark, xa clips play, dialogue opens,
the ambush spawns. Chained shots ARE the directed sequence; one field buys the whole sequencer.

Details that are each a bug if lost: **the editor's preview never fires** (framing a shot must not spawn
the ambush it frames) and **a client never fires** (the graph runs host-authoritative; results arrive in
the snapshot) — both executed in `test-1196`. The field is threaded through all six shot chokepoints
(`_resShot` with a 60-char hostile-file cap, `_normCineShot`, `_newCineShot`, `_newCutscene`, the
primary-cutscene loader/reset, and every serializer map), written as `undefined` when blank so old
levels stay byte-identical. Eleven pins across six cine tests moved with the field lists (178, 226, 248,
462, 463, 464) — each keeps its assertion's intent.

## Delta + keyframe snapshots (build 1197)

The world broadcast was the FULL state 20×/sec in raw-float JSON — every resting coin, sleeping crate and
idle chest re-serialized with 17-digit positions — and the appliers prune by ABSENCE, so nothing could
ever be omitted. Now every 10th snapshot is a FULL keyframe with the old semantics exactly, **and so is
the first snapshot after the connection count changes** — a joiner must never apply deltas against a
baseline it never saw. Between keyframes:
- **Enemies and dynamic props are per-entity deltas** (`_snapDelta`, executed in `test-1197` through
  keyframe/rest/tombstone/new-entity cases). A changed `hd`/`hs` is part of the delta key, so a HIT always
  ships. Deaths arrive as explicit tombstones (`Ex`) — absence is no longer meaningful on a delta, and a
  kill never lingers to the next keyframe. A SLEEPING physics crate serializes nothing.
- **Coins/chests/powerups are changed-only FULL sub-lists** (small lists; per-entry deltas buy nothing) —
  `[]` when changed TO empty so the prune still runs; omitted on a delta means unchanged, while on a
  keyframe omitted still means empty (the old prune, preserved).
- **Everything quantizes** to cm (positions) / mrad (angles) — the single biggest JSON cut, beyond visual
  resolution for interpolated avatars.
- The HUD enemy count rides as `en` — it must not read a partial `E`.

**Relevancy filtering was considered and REJECTED with a reason, not forgotten:** per-client serialization
multiplies host work N-fold at these entity counts (≤60), where one shared snapshot is cheaper — the bytes
were in repetition and precision, not distance. Three pins moved (389, 58, 80 — the E map became `Eall`,
the return gained the delta framing; intents kept).

**SIXTH container rollback recovered during this build** — caught by the bump assert exactly like the
fifth (the script found BUILD_VERSION at 1182, aborted atomically before writing, and the anchors it had
already matched were all pre-1183 net code, so nothing mixed). Same one-command recovery; everything
through 1196 was already pushed.

## The auto-exposure flash (build 1198) — the dead-zone was a discontinuity

Reported from play: **with an HDRI sky, auto-exposure "flashes like crazy."** Eliminated first: a fighting
writer (the meter is the only `toneMappingExposure` writer — grepped) and broken feedback (r149
backgrounds DO tone-map — pinned against the real build in `test-1198`). The oscillator was the METER'S
OWN DEAD-ZONE: inside it the target snapped to neutral; one step outside it re-applied the FULL measured
correction (up to ±1.5 stops). A bright HDRI parks the frame average exactly at that boundary — the ACES
shoulder makes a near-white sky insensitive to exposure, so the loop hunts across it — turning the snap
into a square wave through the 0.9s ease. Rhythmic flashing, from a one-line `if`.

Two stabilisers, each aimed at a mechanism:
- **The dead-zone is now a SOFT KNEE**: `|ev| -= AE_DEAD`, so the response is 0 AT the boundary and grows
  continuously past it — no discontinuity exists for the loop to oscillate across. `test-1198` proves the
  boundary response is ~0 where the old snap jumped a tenth, while a dark frame still reaches the full
  clamp (the knee saturates against it).
- **Median-of-3 harvests**: a single anomalous frame (a PMREM rebuild, a texture-upload blip) cannot move
  the target AT ALL — driven through the real `_aeMeter` with a harvest counter — while a sustained
  change still adapts from the second harvest. Disable clears the buffer.

The general lesson joins 1141's: **a control loop with any discontinuity in its response curve will find
it.** The adaptive ladder needed hysteresis and majority windows; the exposure meter needed continuity.
Two pins moved (1180's disable branch, 1182's harness gained the buffer).

## The level gets a say in the match (build 1265)

The audit's gameplay CRITICAL: the competitive loop is entirely engine-owned. The four PvP modes are a fixed
enum and the score target is typed into the LOBBY, so a creator could build an arena but never a GAME — "this
map is first-to-5 team deathmatch" was unsayable, and every host had to be told the rules out of band.

This does **not** open the enum (a new mode is a real build, not a field). It lets a level state which of the
shipped modes it is FOR and what it is played to. `gameCfg.pvp` / `gameCfg.pvpTarget` serialize with the rest
of the game block, and `_resolveMatch(lobbyMode, lobbyTarget)` is the one place a host asks what to start.

Three decisions worth keeping:
- **A DEFAULT, never a lock.** The lobby's choice always wins if the host touched it. A level can carry its
  intent without taking the room away from the people in it — and a co-op level dropped into a PvP lobby is
  the host's call, not an error the engine should refuse.
- **The target is scoped to the mode it was authored for.** "First to 5" means something different in a duel
  than in king-of-the-hill, so a TDM target is NOT applied to a free-for-all the host picked instead. A target
  with no stated mode applies to whatever PvP mode is played — but never to co-op, which has no score to win.
- **Silence is unchanged.** A level that says nothing hosts as co-op exactly as before, and both fields
  serialize as `undefined` when unset, so a co-op level's JSON does not grow two dead keys.

Clamped on the way in AND the way out (a level file is untrusted input): an unknown mode is discarded rather
than passed through to `NET.gameMode`, and the target is rounded and bounded to 0..999 — a NaN target is a
match that can never end. Two serializer pins moved (21, 33), both keeping their intent.

## The two views disagreed about what you were holding (build 1266)

Reported from play, twice: *"I can't see the weapon in the Held gun grip (third-person) section. It shows up
in the weapons tab, but not when trying to set the position in the player tab."* Build 1264 fixed a different
panel (the viewmodel's own visibility) and this was still broken, which is 1158's pattern again — a fix that
was complete for the half it was tested against.

**The two views resolved their weapon model by different rules.** The first-person viewmodel asks
`wepModelUrl(key)`, which falls back to the engine's own shipped gun. `attachAvatarGun` read
`WEAPONS[key].model` directly and fell back only to **another weapon's** custom model — and every shipped
weapon carries `model:''`, so on the stock loadout the resolved url was `''` and `if(!url){ return; }` left
the hand empty. Not only in the editor panel: in third-person play, and on every remote player and bot. The
grip sliders had nothing to position, which is exactly what "I can't see the weapon" meant.

Probed live with the editor open on the Player tab, any external `.glb` served from a stub, **and the
viewmodel as the control** — it loaded over the same route, so this was never the network:

```
                     WEAPONS.rifle.model   viewmodelUrl        vmLoaded    HAS_GUN   gunLoadUrl
before                        ""           ...58bb.glb         ["rifle"]    false      null
after                         ""           ...58bb.glb         ["rifle"]    true      ...58bb.glb
```
After: `visible true`, NDC `(0.04, 0.06)` — on screen. (The probe's screenshot shows the walk camera, not the
Player-tab orbit: setting `editorOpen` alone does not engage that branch. The geometry is the evidence.)

Three things worth keeping:
- **The borrow was wrong in BOTH directions.** Empty whenever no weapon had a custom model — the entire stock
  loadout — and once a creator set one on any weapon, FISTS borrowed it and the character punched while
  holding a rifle. Both disappear with the resolver.
- **`_wepShowsFists(key)` is now one named predicate asked by both views**, rather than the same condition
  written out in each. Naming a rule in one place and applying it in one place is not the same as a rule
  (1152/1158); this is the cheap version of that lesson applied before it bites.
- **The load path became the COMMON path, so it needed a guard it never had.** `attachAvatarGun` runs every
  frame per avatar, and before the callback lands each frame re-issued `loadGLTFCached` and would clone a
  whole skinned model on completion. `_gunLoading` holds one request in flight per avatar and clears on both
  success and failure — a bad url must not wedge that hand empty for the rest of the match. It clears
  *before* the weapon-changed guard, so switching to a weapon that resolves the same url still re-attaches
  from cache.

Four pins moved (285, 286, 520, 523), each keeping its intent: 286's "a weapon with no model still shows a
gun rather than vanishing" is now served by `wepModelUrl`'s fallback instead of the borrow, and 520/523's
fists gate became an EXECUTED check of the shared predicate rather than a literal.

## The preview was posed inside a camera branch (build 1268)

Reported from play, third round: *"I can't visually see where the held gun grip (third-person) is changing
until I play the live game. I need to make those adjustments live, in the editor."*

**Build 1266 fixed a real bug and was feeding a call site that never ran.** `attachAvatarGun(previewAvatar,
...)` lived inside the Player tab's ORBIT CAMERA branch — the third arm of a chain whose second arm is
`else if(editorOpen && editorFreeFly)` — and opening the editor sets `editorFreeFly = true` **every time**.
So on the camera the editor actually opens with, that branch never executed: no held gun, no joint tweaks
(942), no two-handed hold preview (937). The grip sliders wrote values with nothing on screen to show them.

Posing a preview is not a camera concern, so it no longer sits in a camera branch. `_edPlayerPreviewTick()`
runs from the frame loop **before** the camera chain and names no camera mode at all; the chain decides only
where you are looking from. And entering the Player area now drops into the orbit preview — that camera
exists for nothing else, and everything the tab authors is judged by eye against it — one-shot on the mode
change so `F` still flies, and never on a scene-click, which must not move the creator's viewpoint.

Probed through the REAL editor path (`toggleEditor`, then `setEditorMode('player')`), which is the part that
mattered:
```
editor : editorOpen true, mode "build", active "props", fly TRUE      <- the cause, in one field
tab    : active "player", fly false                                   <- lands on the orbit camera
report : HAS_GUN true, gunVisible true, gunOnScreen true, NDC (0.04, 0.06), cam (0, 1.7, 10.5)
grip   : x/y 0.28,1.15 -> 0.75,1.25 via refreshAvatarGunGrips         <- the sliders move it LIVE
fly    : gun cleared + editorFreeFly=true -> re-attached within 4 s   <- posing survives every mode
```

**The lesson is 1264's, one level deeper: a probe that never enters the real path proves the mechanism, not
the feature.** My 1266 probe set `editorOpen=true` directly instead of going through `setEditorMode`, so it
landed in a camera mode no creator ever sees, reported `HAS_GUN true`, and I shipped. The screenshot from
that run even said so — its HUD read `WALK` — and I dismissed it as a rig artifact rather than the signal it
was. **When a probe's own framing disagrees with the feature's, the framing is the finding.** One pin moved
(942), re-expressed as the WYSIWYG property rather than a line with three spaces in it.

## Screen-size prop culling (build 1267)

The audit's rendering-scale ceiling. The engine had ANIMATION lod and no geometric one: every prop drew at
full cost at any distance and nothing was ever culled by size, so a level's draw cost was flat in the camera
— the one thing that makes a big creator level unplayable while a small one is fine.

The measure is SCREEN SIZE (`radius / distance`), not distance, which is what every engine's bottom LOD rung
actually is. A distance threshold has to be authored per object or it hides a cathedral and keeps a pebble;
screen size needs no authoring, because it asks the only question that matters.

Measured live on a seeded 600-prop field spread to 300 m, rendering the real scene, **with a control pair**:

```
lodPx      calls    tris    culled   visible lights
    0        304   4,624         0        35
    2        106   2,248       494        35     <- the shipped default
    4         67   1,780       564        35
    8         52   1,600       590        35
    0        304   4,624         0        35     <- control returns exactly
```
So it buys DRAW CALLS first (−65% at the default) and triangles second — the right shape, since the props
small enough to cull are by definition the cheap ones per triangle.

**And on the stock level it correctly does nothing**: 59 props / 4,858 tris / 107 calls, with ZERO props
under 8 px. Worth stating plainly rather than implying a win everywhere — this is for the dense imported
level the audit was talking about, and it costs nothing when it finds nothing to do.

Three invariants make it safe, and each is a shipped bug without it:
- **A prop carrying a LIGHT is never hidden.** Hiding one changes the scene's light count and recompiles
  every lit material mid-frame — the freeze of builds 636 / 977 / 1153 / 1155. Measured: **seven of the
  stock level's 59 props carry a light**, so this is the common case here, not an edge one. The light count
  is byte-identical at every threshold above.
- **The editor never culls.** A prop that vanishes for being small is indistinguishable from one you failed
  to place. Opening the editor restores everything.
- **A culled prop still stops bullets.** Build 1236 made any invisible ancestor a ghost that stops no shot —
  correct for a collision volume inside a GLB, catastrophic for a prop the renderer merely skipped drawing.
  `_shotGhost` now exempts `_lodCull`, and 1236's real ghosts are untouched.

**A correction to build 1139, verified against the real build:** that entry recorded *"Raycaster ignores a
mesh's own `visible:false` but NOT its ancestors'."* r149 ignores **both** — the hit arrives regardless,
which is exactly why the `_shotGhost` exemption is able to work. 1236's code was right either way (it walks
the chain itself); only the note was wrong. `test-1267` pins the fact against three, because if a future
version honoured `visible` a culled prop would stop being hit at all and no exemption could save it.

The hysteresis (1.4×) stops a prop at the boundary flickering, and the budget (128 props/frame, rolling
cursor) makes a 2,000-prop level a fixed slice rather than a spike. `lodPx` is **not** zeroed by
`_postOffWorld` — culling is a cost control, not a look.

## The logic graph learns ordered collections (build 1269)

The last gap named in the card/puzzle design pass (1259 closed read-inventory, 1260 closed HUD art). Every
value the graph could hold was ONE NUMBER per name, so "deal a card", "did they press the switches in this
order" and "shuffle the deck" were unsayable — a 52-card deck was 52 nodes and a 4-step combination could
not be compared at all.

One node in STATE, matching the Math node's shape (1169): `List`, with `push / fill 1..N / draw / draw
random / shuffle / remove / clear / length / contains / value at / same order as`. Four decisions:

- **Its own store, not `logicVars`.** Every consumer of that store coerces with `+logicVars[k]||0` — the HUD
  widget mirror, the `hudv` net message, campaign persistence — so a value that is not a number would
  silently become 0 there and travel over the wire as one. `logicLists` keeps `logicVars` exactly what all
  of that already assumes.
- **A value LEAVES a list into a variable.** That is the whole boundary: the existing mirroring, HUD binding
  and persistence apply unchanged and nothing new crosses the wire. Lists are host-side state, like the rest
  of the graph.
- **`fill 1..N` exists because otherwise this is unusable.** A deck in one node is the difference between a
  feature and a demo.
- **`same order as` is the puzzle question.** Order-sensitive comparison is what separates a combination
  lock from a bag of tokens, and it is the one thing no combination of the other ops can express.

**The test rig caught a real inconsistency before it shipped:** every other state node routes its
destination through `_lgVarKey` (build 1231's per-player `name@` convention) and the first draft wrote
`logicVars[dst]` raw. List NAMES now route through it too — so `hand@` is THIS player's hand, which is the
difference between a card game and a card demo, and is exactly where per-player state matters most.

Bounded on both axes (64 lists, 256 entries) because a level file is untrusted input, `put()` never writes
NaN (one would poison every later compare — 1169's lesson), and an unnamed or over-cap list reports empty
rather than throwing mid-graph. Three pins moved (1028's palette↔runtime parity list, and 1033/1060's
datalist-refresh line).

**FIFTH container rollback, recovered mid-build** — the tree reverted to build 1182 (`b246158`) and the
`BUILD_VERSION` anchor simply failed, which is the cheapest possible way to find out. `git log` first,
then `git fetch` + `reset --hard FETCH_HEAD`, then re-run the scripted edit: free again, for the fifth time.
Writing every build as a re-runnable script is what makes this a 30-second interruption instead of a rebuild.

## The rung above culling, and the refresh 1267 owed (build 1270)

A prop stops CASTING a shadow well before it stops being DRAWN. The shadow map is a whole extra scene pass
per cascade, and a shadow cast by something a few pixels across is not a shape anybody can read — so
`LOD_SHADOW_MUL = 4` gives the ladder its cheap middle rung, and unlike a real geometry LOD it needs no
simplified meshes and no simplifier.

Measured on 400 props seeded INSIDE the shadow volume. That detail is the finding: **build 1267's field was
at 300 m, never in a cascade at all**, so the same measurement there would have shown nothing and I would
have concluded there was nothing to get.

```
lodPx     calls     tris   culled   not-casting   meshes casting
    0     1,334   20,428        0             0             460
    1       894   15,184        0           262             198   <- the rung ALONE
    2       558   11,152       81           368              92   <- shipped default
    4       314    8,224      262           398              62
    0     1,362   20,800        0             0             460   <- control
```
**The `lodPx 1` row is the honest isolation: NOTHING was hidden and draw calls still fell 33%.** At the
shipped default the ladder cuts 58%, and most of that is the shadow rung rather than the culling — 368 props
stopped casting while only 81 stopped drawing. The control returns to within 2% rather than exactly (1267's
returned byte-identical) because forcing the shadow map to rebuild each sample includes a cascade fit that
tracks the live camera and sun. Expected drift, not a leak.

**The authored `castShadow` is REMEMBERED, not assumed.** Plenty of meshes legitimately never cast —
levelgen's `nocollide` grass (1096) is the standing example — and a blanket restore to `true` would start a
whole field of grass casting the moment the player walked near it. `_lodSetCasting` captures each mesh's own
value once into `userData._lodCS` and restores THAT. Verified live: a mesh authored `castShadow:false` reads
false at every distance, near and far.

### The defect 1267 shipped, found by building the next rung on top of it

`renderer.shadowMap.autoUpdate` is **false** (build 1093's static shadow map): the map is only redrawn when
`_dirtyShadows()` asks. So build 1267 hiding a prop did **not** remove its shadow — the ground kept the
shadow of something that was no longer drawn until some unrelated event happened to request a refresh, and
an un-culled prop came back without one. In practice `_shDirty` fires whenever the player moves, so it would
usually self-correct; standing still while the rolling cursor crossed a prop's threshold is where it shows.

Both rungs now set `_lodDirty` and the tick requests a refresh once, at the end, only when something
actually changed — so a settled scene still pays nothing. Verified live: `autoUpdate false`, and one
state-changing tick leaves `_shadowDirtyFrames` at 2.

**This is build 1263's lesson arriving from the other side.** That one was *a perf change may not remove
work something else was silently relying on*; this one is *a perf change may not skip work something else
silently needs*. Both are the same question — what did the thing you changed used to do for someone else? —
and the shadow map has now answered it twice.

## Safe expressions — the escape hatch, in the only form this engine can ship (build 1271)

The audit's editor CRITICAL was "no scripting escape hatch": the graph is expressive but anything the nodes
cannot say is unsayable, and every competitor lets you drop to code. `(hp / maxhp) * 100` took three Math
nodes and two throwaway variables; `score + wave * 10 + bonus` took four.

**It cannot be `eval` or `new Function`, and that is the whole design.** Levels travel as share codes,
`.rumpus` files and URLs, and a player opens someone else's level by clicking a link — so compiling creator
text as JavaScript would be remote code execution in that player's browser, against their saves, their
settings and their session. There are **zero** uses of `eval`/`new Function` in this engine and that is not
an accident; `test-1271` asserts it engine-wide so this build cannot be what changes it.

So it is a hand-written tokenizer and Pratt parser producing a closure tree. Precedence, right-associative
`^`, unary minus, comparisons and `&&`/`||` returning 1/0 (so they feed Branch and the HUD unchanged), and a
fixed function table (`abs floor ceil round sqrt sign min max clamp lerp rand`). **The safety is
STRUCTURAL:** there is no property access, no indexing, no assignment and no way to name anything outside the
table — not because a filter rejects them, but because the grammar cannot express them. 35 hostile inputs
(`document.cookie`, `a.constructor("return 1")()`, `x = 1`, backtick literals, `?.`, `??`, `typeof`,
`delete`) are refused at COMPILE time.

Never NaN or Infinity (1169's rule — one poisoned value corrupts every compare downstream): `1/0`, `5%0`,
`0/0` and an overflowing power all resolve to 0. Bounded at 240 chars, depth 24, and a 200-entry compile
cache that also remembers REJECTIONS, so a hostile level cannot force a re-parse every pulse.

**One hardening the test rig forced.** `constructor` and `__proto__` are legal identifiers, so they compile —
to a *variable read*. `logicVars` is a plain object, so that read returned `Object.prototype.constructor`,
and it was safe only because `+Function` is NaN and `||0` swallowed it. Luck, not design. The getter now
tests `hasOwnProperty`, so an unset name reads 0 because it is unset — and a creator who legitimately names a
variable `constructor` gets their own value.

## A melee weapon can be the starting weapon (build 1272)

Reported from play: *"there's no option under gameplay to set the melee weapon as the starting weapon."*
Correct, and it was a gap BETWEEN two features rather than a bug in either. Build 976 added `startWeapon` as
"the PRIMARY you spawn with" and filtered `!melee` out of the list; fists got their own **Start unarmed**
checkbox, which also carries the stricter no-guns-at-all rule. The CROWBAR belonged to neither — melee, so
excluded from the dropdown; not fists, so the checkbox did not give it. The standard survival-horror opener
(start with a melee weapon, find a gun) was unauthorable.

The filter is now "not the FISTS slot" rather than "not melee", named once as `_canStartWith` and asked by
all six sites — the dropdown, its current-value guard, both loaders, the serializer and the deploy. **Six
copies of a condition is how the crowbar got lost in the first place**, which is 1266's lesson again.

**And the consequence is fixed in the same build rather than left as a surprise.** A melee weapon with no
model of its own fell through `wepModelUrl`'s fallback and put the ENGINE'S GUN in the player's hands while
they swung it. Invisible before this build (nobody could start with a crowbar) and immediately visible
after, so `_wepShowsFists` now covers every melee weapon, not just the fists slot — and because build 1266
shares that predicate with the third-person hand, the body agrees with the viewmodel. A creator's own model
still wins (674), which is the intended path for an actual crowbar mesh, and the panel hint says so.

Seven pins moved (520, 523, 62, and four in 976). Two of them — 520/523's "a melee weapon that is not FISTS
still shows a model" — are the rare case where a pin's ASSERTION was deliberately inverted rather than
re-expressed: that behaviour was the defect.

## Culling ships OFF, because I could not explain the report (build 1273)

Reported from play against 1267: *"I've placed some props and they don't appear now unless I'm right in
front of them... large models I've imported literally don't appear until the player gets right up on them.
Then they disappear as soon as the player has barely moved away."*

**I could not reproduce it.** Probed with a real imported GLB placed through the actual `spawnProp` path:
bbox 79 × 8.5 × 79, cached `_lodR` **56.02** matching a live re-measure to three decimals, and **not culled
at any distance out to 120 m** (px 137 at 120 m). So the screen-size maths is right for that asset and the
mechanism behind the report is still unidentified.

That is precisely why this build does not try to out-argue it. **A performance feature that removes a
creator's content by default, and that I cannot fully explain, does not get to stay on by default.**
`lodPx` now defaults to **0**. The feature is unchanged and still does everything 1267 and 1270 measured
when a creator turns it on; what changed is who decides.

Three things make it safe to turn on, two of which are real defects found while looking:

- **`LOD_NEAR_KEEP = 40`.** Nothing inside 40 m is ever culled or stops casting, whatever its screen size.
  This makes the reported symptom unreachable *by construction*, independently of whether the screen-size
  maths is right for a given asset — which is the point: a measurement that is wrong for ONE asset must not
  be able to delete it. The floor also beats the hysteresis band, so walking up to something restores it at
  once.
- **CSS pixels, not the drawing buffer — a real bug.** `domElement.height` is the backing store, which build
  1141's adaptive resolution ladder shrinks under load. Measured live mid-session: **buffer 518 against a
  720 CSS height, pixel ratio 0.72**, so every cull distance was 32% shorter than the number the creator
  typed — and *how much* shorter depended on which rung the ladder happened to be on. The worse a device
  performed, the more of the level it deleted. The creator's threshold is in the pixels they SEE.
- **Re-measure before removing — the asymmetry that matters.** The cached radius is now used only for the
  cheap direction (deciding something is big enough to KEEP). Before anything is actually hidden, the radius
  is measured again from the live scene graph. A wrong cache can then only ever cost one `Box3` — never a
  missing building — and the re-measure repairs the cache in passing. `test-1273` proves it by lying to the
  cache by four orders of magnitude and showing the prop still cannot be hidden.

**The general rule this is an instance of:** when a report and a measurement disagree, and the feature's
failure mode is *deleting the user's work*, the measurement does not get the benefit of the doubt. Ship the
safe default, make the symptom structurally impossible, and leave the door open. Four pins moved (1267's
default, 1270's hint text, and both LOD rigs, which needed the new constant and helper).

## Cull from the geometry, and make the culler answerable (build 1274)

Two follow-ups to 1273's unreproducible report, after three more hypotheses were tested and none reproduced
it. Worth recording what was ELIMINATED, since the next person will otherwise re-test them:

| hypothesis | result |
|---|---|
| a real imported GLB measures a wrong radius | **no** — bbox 79×8.5×79, cached `_lodR` 56.02 matching a live re-measure to 3 dp, never culled to 120 m |
| geometry offset far from the prop's origin makes it vanish | **not at size** — a 40-unit model with a 300 m offset still reads 50 px at its origin distance |
| a rigged model measures a collapsed bbox | **no** — `Box3.setFromObject` on a real `SkinnedMesh` returns the REST pose (20×20×20 for 20×20×20 geometry). It does not follow the animated pose, which is a mild inaccuracy, but it is the right order of magnitude |

**1. The distance is now measured to the geometry's CENTRE, not the prop's origin.** The offset hypothesis
did not reproduce the report, but it is a real inaccuracy and the probe constructed an ordinary case — a
building whose geometry is 20 m from the camera while its origin is 320 m away. Measuring to the origin asks
"how far am I from a point in empty space". The centre is cached as an OFFSET from the origin beside the
radius, so the per-frame path stays allocation-free, and it is re-measured wherever the radius is. The
`LOD_NEAR_KEEP` floor uses it too, or the floor would protect the wrong point in space.

**2. `lodReport()` — the culler accounts for itself**, in the Level Check panel a creator already opens when
something looks wrong: the threshold in force, how many props are hidden, how many stopped casting, how many
are even eligible, and **the smallest measured prop radius with its source name**. That last one is the tell:
a large model reading a tiny radius is precisely the class of bug that could not be ruled out, and it turns
the next report into one number. It says nothing at all when culling is off or idle — an opt-in feature must
not nag.

**The general lesson, and it is the one worth keeping from this whole sequence:** when a report cannot be
reproduced, the fix is not to guess harder. It is (a) ship the safe default, (b) make the reported symptom
structurally impossible, and (c) *make the subsystem able to answer the question next time*. Builds 1273 and
1274 are those three steps. A subsystem that can delete things from the screen has to be able to say what it
removed and why.

## The marquee learns lights (build 1275)

The top-view marquee swept only `propModels` — and every marquee ended with `selLights = []`, so
box-selecting anything silently threw a light selection away. Laying out a row of lamps is exactly the job
the marquee exists for and it was the one thing it could not do.

The editor's selection is ONE TYPE AT A TIME (`activeSel()` returns `selProps` or `selLights` depending on
`editorActive`), and a genuinely mixed selection means reworking the gizmo, the group ops and the inspector —
a real build, not a side effect of this one. So the marquee picks the type the box actually CAUGHT: it keeps
the type you are already working in when the box contains any of them, and switches when the box contains
only the other. Both flows a creator would try therefore work, and neither acts on something invisible.
Locked and hidden lights dodge it exactly as props do (1036), and shift still adds.

## A trigger zone can watch for a prop (build 1276)

Build 1170 gave props a runtime lifecycle (show/hide/move/destroy) and 1258 let the graph shove them, but
nothing could **detect** one. "The ball is in the goal", "the crate is on the pressure plate", "the key
landed in the slot" were all unaskable — which is most of what a sports or physics-puzzle level is made of.

`who` gains `prop`, with an optional tag (blank = any prop). Props take the ENEMY's union edge for the same
reason enemies have it: a prop has no pid, and a per-prop edge would turn a pile of debris rolling through a
zone into a pulse each. A prop that is invisible, destroyed, or hidden by the graph does not count — hidden
means not in play.

**The trap this build nearly shipped, and it is worth the space.** Both existing branches tested the audience
by EXCLUSION — `if(z.who!=='enemy')` and `if(z.who!=='player')`. That is correct for a three-value enum and
silently wrong the instant a fourth arrives: a `prop` zone matches neither exclusion, so it would have fired
for players AND enemies as well as props. **Adding a value to an enum tested by exclusion enables every
branch that did not name the new value.** The three audiences are now stated positively, and `test-1276`
executes all four columns — including that `any` did NOT silently gain props.

Serialization needed no new code: `triggers` round-trips through `_migrateTrigger`, so sanitizing the tag
there covers both directions at once. That is the shape to copy for any future zone field.

## The build-1276 audit, and its three client-side CRITICALs (build 1277)

Eight domain critics were run against the committed 1276 tree, each required to verify claims in source
before asserting them and to score 1-10. Reports are in `scratchpad-audit/`. **Every headline claim was
re-verified by hand before being acted on**, and all of the ones below held.

### Six of the 27 logic verbs had never worked

`showprop / hideprop / moveprop / delprop / pushprop / spawnprop` were implemented in `_applyWorldAction`
and offered in the Do node's dropdown — but `_applyWorldAction` has exactly ONE call site, and the verb list
gating it named none of them. Every prop verb fell through to the tag loop, which handles only
toggle/open/close/anim/unlock, and did nothing. **Builds 1170, 1216 and 1258 each shipped capability no level
could reach**: nothing could destroy, hide, show, move, shove or spawn a prop at runtime. `spawnprop` was
dead twice over — the Do node also dropped `prefab` from the object it forwarded.

**The tests are why it survived, and that is the lesson.** They asserted the HANDLER's source and the
DROPDOWN's source and never that a node reaches the handler — build 1158's "wrong half" pattern, in test
form. `test-1277` walks the node→dispatcher→handler PATH by execution, and checks the inverse too (a tag
verb must still NOT reach the world handler). Pin both ends of a wire and you have proven nothing about the
wire.

`_isWorldVerb` deliberately still excludes them: it means "takes no target tag", and a prop verb does take
one.

### Level text could reach the DOM as markup

`_creditEsc` escaped `& < >` but **not `"`**, and `_creditLinkify` drops its match inside `href="$1"` — so a
single quote in an attribution closed the attribute and opened an event handler. The payoff was the publish
key, the Sketchfab token, an Anthropic key, and the `breach_comm_api`/`breach_ice` endpoint overrides, which
make a backdoor persistent. Escaping quotes costs nothing in a text node (`&quot;` renders as `"`), so one
function stays correct in both contexts rather than the caller having to know which it is in. Weapon names
and key names — both level-authored — were also reaching `innerHTML` raw.

**And build 1166's SAFE credits renderer was dead code.** `bindPauseMenu` assigned the safe handler, then an
older line six below re-assigned the same element back to the vulnerable path. It was invisible because
**two buttons carried `id="pauseCredits"`**, so `getElementById` only ever reached the first and nobody
noticed the second was inert. One handler now, both buttons wired.

### A GitHub Action was a command injection into the published site

Fixed in its own commit ahead of the rest: `publish-level.yml` interpolated an attacker-controlled level
name into shell and into a `github-script` template literal. A `${{ }}` expression is pasted into the script
TEXT before the shell sees it, so `$(...)` or a backtick in a submitted level name ran as a command in a job
holding `contents: write` — against the branch Pages serves. Name, file and reason now travel through `env:`
and are read as `"$LEVEL_NAME"` / `process.env.LEVEL_NAME`.

### Scores, and what the audit retracted

rendering 7 · editor 7 · gameplay 7 · performance 7 · features 6 · multiplayer 5 · platform 5.

Two previously-recorded CRITICALs died on verification this round, which is the rule working in both
directions: **KTX2, meshopt and Draco are all wired** (the last audit's "deliberately unwired" was false),
as the phantom-BVH claim was false before it. Five pins moved (1074, 1077, 238, 418, 835).

## The relay is an allow-list now (build 1279)

The audit's multiplayer CRITICAL. Build 1205 closed client-to-client damage relaying and wrote the rule as
*"only KNOWN damage types are mediated, everything else passes"*, reasoning that a whitelist would rot as
new cosmetics arrived. **That is backwards for a trust boundary.** The destination's handler is
`handleHostMsg`, which cannot tell a relayed packet from one the host sent — so the relay was a write
primitive into every host-authoritative verb, and 1205's fix covered exactly one door in a room with 36.

Verified before changing anything: `hurt` (25613) applied `msg.d` with **no clamp**, and `raceFin` (25584)
declared a race winner with **no lap check at all**.

The allow-list is DERIVED, not guessed: `sendToPlayer` is the only builder of a targeted message, and of the
eight types that reach it, four (`wact`, `frag`, `credit`, `power`) are host→client verbs a client has no
business relaying. The remaining three plus `pvpHit` are genuine peer traffic. **Anything else is dropped**
— and a dropped cosmetic is a missing visual, while a forwarded verb is a stolen match. A new peer type must
be named here, which is the cost this design accepts and 1205 declined to.

**A SET, not an object literal — and my own test caught that before it shipped.** `{...}[msg.t]` inherits
`Object.prototype`, so `{t:'constructor'}` and `{t:'toString'}` look like members and sail straight through.
An allow-list with a hole in it is worse than none, because it reads as safe. Same trap build 1271 closed for
the expression evaluator's variable lookup; third time this file has met it.

Two credit claims are now checked rather than believed:
- **`raceFin`** is tested against the lap count the host already tracks from each racer's own `race`
  progress messages. The evidence was sitting right there; nobody had asked for it.
- **`died`** gets a per-source leaky bucket (0.5/s, burst 3) beside the damage buckets from 1164. A player
  dying every 8 seconds is never limited — proven by execution — while a farming loop gets three.

`test-1205`'s "cosmetic relays pass verbatim" case used `fire`, which the host BROADCASTS from its own
handler — a targeted `fire` was never real traffic, only something the test constructed. It now asserts the
inversion: a host verb addressed to a peer is dropped, and so is a cosmetic that fails closed. Three pins
moved (1130, 836, 1205).

## The test gate (build 1278)

1,018 harnesses existed and nothing ran them but a human remembering to, while both other workflows deploy.
`tests.yml` runs syntax → boot → suite on every push and PR. One detail worth its comment: `run-all.mjs`
does exit 1 on failure, but it is piped through `tee`, and a pipeline reports the LAST command's status — so
without `set -o pipefail` a red suite looks green. That is the exact masking that made a local
`node run-all.mjs | tail -2` report success during this audit.

## The prop entry is applied in one place (build 1280)

The audit's code-quality CRITICAL, and the most valuable structural change in the sequence. A
**1,326-character block was BYTE-IDENTICAL** in `loadHostedProps`, `loadLevelFromNet` and `restoreLevel` —
the three paths by which a prop reaches the scene: first load, a multiplayer joiner, and every level load
or undo.

**The critic proved the cost by MUTATION rather than by argument**, which is why it landed. Delete one
statement (`if(p.tg) obj.userData.tag=p.tg;`) from ONE copy and the suite stays **fully green** while every
prop a joiner receives silently loses its tag — taking the trigger zones, all six prop verbs, the push verb,
logic-graph place resolution and joint targets with it. Nothing tested that the three agreed, because there
was nothing to test: agreement was a fact about the TEXT, and text drifts. This file had already fixed two
symptoms of it (1162's duplicate, 1252's emitter config) and called "four loader sites" a fact of nature.

`_pfSpawnEntry` keeps its own near-copy **deliberately** and is not merged: prefabs and paste strip identity
(a fresh gid, no nid) and that difference is the feature. Two functions that differ on purpose beat three
that are supposed to match — but the reason is now written beside the shared one, or the next reader
"fixes" it.

**Fourteen harnesses failed on the refactor, and that is the finding, not the inconvenience.** Every one of
them asserted a variant of *"this field is restored at all N loader sites"* by COUNTING occurrences of
duplicated text. They were measuring the duplication, not the behaviour — so they would have gone green
against three copies that had quietly diverged, and they went red against one copy that is correct. Each was
converted to ask where the field actually lives (`extractFunction('_applyPropEntry')`), which is immune to
the count and says what was always meant.

`test-1280` reproduces the critic's exact mutation and proves it now bites, executes every field the entry
carries (tag, group, prefab mark, interact, name, folder, hide, lock, dialogue, NPC name, all twelve signal
fields, threshold, attribution), and pins `_pfSpawnEntry`'s divergence so nobody merges it by mistake.

**The general rule: a test that counts copies of a thing is a test of the copying.** If the answer to "is
this applied everywhere?" is a number greater than one, the test is measuring the wrong property.

## Mouse sensitivity, and a zoom-matched aim (build 1281)

The gameplay audit's #1 finding: the engine shipped a gamepad look slider (909) and TWO touch sliders (1042)
and **nothing at all for the mouse** — the primary input, and the first setting a player in this genre
changes. `HIP_SENS` was a `const` with two consumers, so a player whose DPI disagreed with one hardcoded
number had to change it system-wide.

A MULTIPLIER, not a replacement: **1.0 is byte-identical** to every value builds 160–1280 were tuned
against, so nothing authored moves. Both mouse consumers now ask one derivation (`_mouseSensNow`), so they
cannot drift.

**Zoom-matched aim, off by default.** The audit measured the shipped ratio: `ADS_SENS/HIP_SENS = 0.545`
against a **2.34× magnification**, so the same mouse travel swept ~28% more world while aimed — which is
what "muscle memory doesn't carry into ADS" actually means. The option divides by the real magnification,
`tan(baseFov/2)/tan(adsFov/2)`, not the fov ratio. `test-1281` proves the defining property directly: one
mouse-inch sweeps the same on-screen arc aimed or not. Off by default because it changes a feel every
existing player has learned.

**The first draft had a live TDZ and its own catch would have hidden it.** `mouseSens`'s initialiser reads
`MOUSE_SENS_MIN` inside a `try/catch`, and the constants were declared 25 lines BELOW it — so every saved
sensitivity would have been silently discarded, invisibly, forever. Build 1127's trap verbatim. The boot
test passed, because the catch swallowed it. Ordering is now pinned.

## Publish runs the Level Check (build 1282)

`levelIssues()` had exactly two call sites — its own definition and the panel that renders it. So the engine
would write *"this prop's model is stored on this device only and will load for nobody else"* and then let
the creator publish that level to strangers anyway. The knowledge existed; nothing asked for it at the one
moment it mattered. This was quick-win #3 in the build-1253 audit and had not moved since.

It runs AFTER serializing (so it sees exactly what would be uploaded) and BEFORE the name prompt (so nobody
names a level they then abandon), shows six issues and counts the rest, and **advises rather than refuses** —
a warning is not proof of a defect, and an engine that blocks publishing on its own heuristic will be wrong
sometimes and infuriating always.

**`uiConfirm` would have been a worse bug than the one being fixed.** It only calls back on CONFIRM, so a
cancelled dialog would leave the promise pending forever and the publish flow would die silently. `_uiDialog`
runs each button's `fn` and routes Escape to the first non-primary one, so all three exits settle.

**Two harnesses failed on a character-count-scoped slice** (`{0,4800}`) — build 1149's recorded trap, again.
The handler is an anonymous `onclick` so `extractFunction` cannot reach it; both now anchor on the next
named declaration after it, which fails loudly if the handler is restructured instead of drifting silently.

## The enemy telegraphs are audible (build 1283)

Across all 85 `SFX.*` call sites, enemies made sound in exactly THREE: a ranged shot (twice) and death. So
build 627's 320 ms melee wind-up and the charger's 520 ms lunge tell — **the two mechanics that exist
specifically to be reacted to** — were purely visual, and a brute closing from behind you was silent. The
panner and distance falloff had existed since build 1208; nothing was using them.

Four cues, all positional so they carry the direction the threat is coming from, which is the entire point
for something behind you:
- **`meleeWind`** at the start of the wind-up, and **`lungeWind`** at the start of the charger's. Both RISE
  in pitch, because a rising tell reads as "about to happen" without needing to be loud.
- **`meleeSwing`** when the wind-up completes, hit or miss. It FALLS — it is the impact, not the warning.
- **`enemyHurt`**, placed after the `killEnemy` early-return so a corpse does not grunt. Shooting something
  you cannot see previously told you nothing: the hitmarker is on screen and the thing you shot is not.

**A footfall for a closing enemy is deferred, with the reason recorded rather than guessed.** It is the
other half of "a brute behind you is inaudible", but a per-enemy step is CONTINUOUS rather than
event-driven — its value is entirely in the density, and 40 enemies in a wave is mud if that is wrong.
Tuning it needs a live listen the headless harness cannot give. The four above are discrete events that
cannot spam. No unused sound was left in the table.

## DoF was getting neither MSAA nor FXAA (build 1284)

The rendering critic's sharpest catch. `_postRT` DECLARES `samples:4` at the top rung — but the DoF path
rasterises the scene into `_dofRT`, which is single-sampled because r149 will not attach a depth texture to
a multisampled target, and then blits the result in. So the gate `(_postRT.samples||0) === 0` read "MSAA is
in effect" and skipped FXAA **while MSAA had never touched a pixel**. DoF-on at rung 0 got neither, plus the
cost of a multisampled target that only ever received a fullscreen quad.

**The comment three lines above states the opposite intent verbatim** — *"FXAA covers the one path 4× MSAA
cannot — DoF"* — which is exactly how it survived: the code read as if it did what the comment said. The gate
now asks whether THIS FRAME was multisampled (`samples > 0 && !dofEnabled`) rather than what the target
declares. `test-1283` executes all four combinations.

Two pins moved (1126's gate literal, 1115's encode-position pattern, which now allows any run of comments
and const declarations between the encode and the branch rather than one exact line).

## Alpha-cutout foliage was a field of solid rectangles (build 1285)

**The SIXTH arrival of build 1152's rule**, after the sky dome (1126), the weather points (1126), the world
flipbooks (1152) and the viewmodel muzzle flash (1158).

A glTF `alphaMode:MASK` material arrives from GLTFLoader as **opaque** — `transparent:false`,
`depthWrite:true` — with the cutout expressed as `alphaTest`. So both of `_aoHideNoDepth`'s tests passed it.
But the prepass runs under `scene.overrideMaterial`, which REPLACES the material and with it the alpha test,
so every grass blade, leaf card, fence and grate stamped its full **rectangle** into the AO, SSR and
velocity buffers as solid geometry. The level generator emits exactly this for foliage (`alphaMode:'MASK'`,
cutoff 0.32) — so a garden arena was writing a field of solid quads into the buffer that decides where the
frame is dark.

**Why five namings did not stop the sixth:** the rule was *"nothing that fails to write depth belongs in a
depth-derived buffer"*, and a cutout **does** write depth. What it does not write is the depth of its own
SILHOUETTE. The predicate now asks whether the override material can REPRESENT the object at all, which is
the property that actually matters.

The trade, stated rather than left to be discovered: a cutout surface now contributes no AO, SSR or velocity
of its own. Its correct shape would need the prepass to carry each material's map and `alphaTest` — a real
build, and worth one. A missing occluder is a far smaller error than a solid rectangle where a leaf is.

**The first draft undid build 1168 in the same stroke.** Declaring the predicate inside the traverse
callback allocates one closure PER OBJECT across two scenes every frame — precisely the transient 1168
measured and removed. It is `_aoNoDepthMat`, a module-scope function declaration, and `test-1285` asserts
that no arrow function survives inside the traverse. **A fix that reintroduces a documented optimisation's
bug is not a fix**; the log is only useful if it is read in the direction of the code being touched, not
just the code being fixed.

Four call sites share it, not two: the AO G-buffer and the velocity pass each sweep both the world and
viewmodel scenes. Three pins moved (1152, 1158, 1168), each an executing rig that needed the predicate
lifted from real source rather than restated.

## The bake was occlusion applied as albedo (build 1286)

The per-vertex sky-visibility bake wrote its result into the `color` attribute and set
`vertexColors = true`. **Verified against the real r149 build**: `<color_fragment>` sits at index 2327 of
`ShaderLib.physical.fragmentShader` and `<lights_fragment_begin>` at 2707 — so `diffuseColor.rgb *= vColor`
ran BEFORE any lighting, which means a sky-visibility term was multiplying the surface's ALBEDO and
therefore attenuating **direct sunlight**.

Wrong three times over: the shadow map already answers direct occlusion, SSAO applies a contact term again
at composite, and a vertex at 50% sky visibility was additionally losing 32% of its direct sun
(`0.35 + 0.65*0.5 = 0.675`).

Occlusion is an INDIRECT-ONLY term, which is exactly how three treats its own `aoMap`: `<aomap_fragment>`
(index 2806, after every lighting chunk) multiplies `indirectDiffuse` and `indirectSpecular` and never
touches albedo. The bake could not USE `aoMap` — that needs a uv2 an arbitrary GLB does not have, which is
the reason the per-vertex path exists at all — so it borrows the same position via `onBeforeCompile`.

Three things in the patch are load-bearing:
- **It CHAINS any existing `onBeforeCompile`.** Build 1145's object-space detail and `floorMat`'s paint
  splat both use that hook; clobbering one silently removes a whole subsystem. A throwing predecessor is
  caught, too — the bake must not depend on someone else's code succeeding.
- **Applied once per material** (`_bakeOccPatched`), or the `replace` would stack.
- **`customProgramCacheKey` composes** rather than overwriting, so a material carrying both patches is
  still one program per combination and not one per material.

`test-1286` applies the patch to the REAL shader source and asserts both replaces LAND — a `replace` that
silently misses is how this file has twice lost a subsystem, and it fails as a plausible-looking frame
rather than an error. It also pins the ordering (the multiply must fall after `lights_fragment_end`, or
`indirectDiffuse` does not exist yet) and the `USE_COLOR` guard.

**A regex trap worth remembering: `indirectDiffuse` contains `directDiffuse` as a substring.** The first
draft's "never touches the direct terms" assertion was matching the indirect ones and failing. Match the
full property path.

**Not capture-verified.** The shader maths and the chunk ordering are proven against the real build, but
what this looks like needs a browser pass: interiors should get DARKER indirect and keep their direct
sunlight, so a sunbeam through a doorway should read stronger than before while the shadowed corners hold.

## A HUD widget can finally show YOUR number (build 1287)

The feature audit's third finding, and it killed every co-op shop and scoreboard. Build 1231 gave the graph
per-player variables and taught the toast node to interpolate them; `_hwText`'s regex was `[\w#]+` with no
`@`, so a widget bound to `coins@` matched nothing and rendered the literal text. **And even had it parsed,
the host→client mirror broadcast ONE scalar per name to every connection** — so every player would have seen
the HOST's value. Either half alone is still broken.

**`_hwVarKey`, deliberately NOT `_lgVarKey`.** The graph's resolver keys on `_lgCtx.pid` — *"the player this
event is about"* — which is exactly right inside a pulse and exactly wrong for a HUD, which draws every
frame **outside any event**, where the pid is whatever the last pulse left behind (0 in practice). A widget
asks "what is MY number", so it resolves against `NET.myId`. That the answer has the same shape on host and
client is what lets the mirror stay a plain scalar per connection instead of becoming a routing problem.

The mirror now splits shared names from per-player ones, resolves each connection's own pid into its packet,
and includes the per-player values in its change-detection signature — without that last part a per-player
change would never have been sent at all. A level with no per-player widgets still sends ONE shared object
rather than a copy per connection.

**The client stores under its OWN key.** The host sends a per-player name under its BARE key (`coins@`)
carrying that client's value, and the client re-keys it to `coins@<myId>`. Sending the host-resolved key
would be wrong the moment ids differ, and silently so.

Three pins moved. Two are worth noting for their shape: `test-1058`'s rig had to be given `_hwVarKey`
(lifted from source, never restated — a rig that restates a predicate keeps passing against a stale copy),
and `test-1269` was slicing 200 characters from `msg.t==='hudv'` to reach an assignment my comment had
pushed past — **the fourth character-budget slice this audit has broken**, after 1149 supposedly converted
them all. They only surface when something nearby grows.

## The ledge hang stopped asking which camera is active (build 1289)

Reported from play: *"Ledge hang in third-person is still not working. I noticed that in first-person, the
camera height is much lower than what is in third-person."* Both halves are one fault, and the second
observation is the tell.

Build 966 derived the hang's height from the DRAWN BODY's bounding box and 1239 tuned `LEDGE_HANG_SINK`
against it — but that measurement was gated on `_ownAvatar.visible`, which is **false in first person**. So
the same jump at the same box produced two different COLLIDER heights depending on which camera was showing.
Measured live on the stock level's 2.2 m box, holding W into it from 2.6 m out:

```
                    hy (player.pos.y at full hang)
first person                1.75      <- 0.45 under the lip: the framing 1239 tuned
third person  BEFORE        1.58      <- exactly _gy + EYE - 0.12, the floor clamp
third person  AFTER         1.75
```

1.58 is the *"never feet-through-the-floor"* clamp winning, i.e. the body standing at the wall base with its
arms in the air — which is exactly what the report's screenshot showed. And it won on **every reachable
ledge**: the ideal beats the clamp only when `lip - ground > vh*1.02 + 0.30`, so `vh = 1.7` needs a 2.03 m
rise (just inside the 1.55-2.05 window) and `vh = 2.2` needs 2.54 m (outside it, always).

**Why `vh` read 2.2 for a 1.9 m player: the stock third-person body is a STYLISED capsule proxy.**
`remoteBodyGeo = CapsuleGeometry(0.5, 1.2)` boxes 2.2 m, and its *head zone* (`_mkHeadProxy`) sits at 1.66 —
the gameplay head is right, the lozenge's top just overshoots by half a metre. The term was reading a piece
of art as a body height.

**CORRECTION, measured after this build shipped.** This section first said the camera observation had the
same cause — "the third-person boom rides a body drawn taller than the collider". **That is wrong, and it
was written from reading `_avatarHangDrop` rather than from reading `_tpPivot`.** The boom pivots at
`footY + centerLocal.y`, which for the stock capsule is a **hardcoded 1.0** and never looks at the bounding
box at all. Probed at a standing pose, `tpHeight = 0`, `tpTilt = 0`:

```
first person   camera.position.y = 1.700   (the eye)
third person   camera.position.y = 1.002   (foot + centerLocal.y)
```
So the third-person camera is **0.7 m LOWER**, not higher — the opposite of what the retracted sentence
claimed and of the direction in the report. The ledge fix above stands on its own measurement and is
unaffected; only the camera explanation was wrong. *Three sections of this file already say some version of
"a frame statistic cannot test a mechanism" — this is the same mistake with source instead of pixels: I
explained a second symptom with the mechanism I had just finished proving for the first one, without
opening the code that owns it.*

The fix splits the two facts that had been conflated:
- **`LEDGE_REACH = EYE*1.02 + LEDGE_HANG_SINK`** — the PLAYER's reach, so the collider hangs identically in
  every view. Numerically the exact expression first person already evaluated, so **that view is
  byte-identical** and 1239's tuning is untouched.
- **`_avatarHangDrop(a)`** — how tall the character is DRAWN, applied to the avatar's foot placement in
  `updateOwnAvatar`, clamped so the body's feet never go under the ground beneath it, eased on the collider's
  own 0.18 s curve and faded back out across the pull-up so the body does not snap when it mounts the top.
  966's "raised hands land on the lip" survives intact — it now sizes the body instead of the player, which
  is the layer a visual belongs in, and it finally works for an imported character of any height.

**The general rule this is an instance of: a gameplay quantity must never be derived from something only the
renderer knows.** Build 1140 established that for the viewmodel's AO; this is the same thing one level down —
`_ownAvatar.visible` is a camera state, and it was silently deciding how high the player hung.

Four pins moved (966, 1168, 1239, 1243) and every one kept its assertion's intent: 1168's once-a-second Box3
budget, 1243's ground clamp and 1239's sink are all still asserted, at their new addresses.

**The probe is the durable part.** `scratchpad/ledge3.mjs` boots the real game headless, finds a grabbable
collider, and runs the whole trial INSIDE the closure off `requestAnimationFrame` — one round trip instead of
one per sample, which is the difference between 40 s and a timeout under SwiftShader. It reports `_ledge`'s
phase, `hy`, `mantleLedge` at all four scan distances and the drawn body's foot, per frame, for `tpMode`
false and true. Two earlier drafts failed for reasons worth not repeating: `window.__probe` is injected
*inside* `startGame`, so it does not exist until the start button has been clicked; and polling from Node at
60 ms is far slower than the frames it is trying to sample.

## The blow lands when the swing does (build 1303)

Reported from play: *"when hitting props with the sword it is finnicky. It deals damage immediately, even
though the swing hasn't even gotten close to the prop yet in the animation."* Correct — the whole hit
resolution ran on the frame the button went down, so a 400 ms swing animation was decoration over an instant
hit.

Melee ENEMIES have telegraphed since build 627 (`ENEMY_MELEE_WINDUP_MS = 320`): wind up, then strike, and
back out during the windup and the swing whiffs. **The player never got the same treatment.** `meleeAttack`
is now the swing (pose + whoosh) and `_meleeStrike` is the contact, separated by a per-weapon `windup` —
which joins build 1296's stat sheet, so it serializes and appears in the editor for free. Crowbar 160 ms,
fists 90, guns 0.

Three decisions:
- **The aim is re-read at CONTACT**, not captured at the swing. That is the forgiving direction and the one
  that matches the animation: the blade connects with whatever it is pointing at when it arrives.
- **A pending strike is cancelled by switching weapon** (build 1172's token rule for reloads), and
  `_meleeStrike` re-checks `gameOn / editorOpen / paused / duelDead`, because a windup is real time and a
  blow that lands after you died is worse than one that whiffs.
- **The melee toggle seeds a windup.** A gun's factory value is 0 — right for a trigger, wrong for a swing —
  so converting one without this would land its blow before the animation moved.

## A one-shot request turned the slot it fell back to into a one-shot (build 1304)

Reported in the same breath: *"it freezes the animation on idle after I use the weapon a few times. The
character gets stuck in the idle position, no animation, but I can still move them around. If I run a
distance away it picks back up."*

`setEnemyAnimState` read the loop mode, hold and speed from **`state`** — the name the caller asked for —
and applied them to **`next`**, the action `_stateActionKey` actually RESOLVED. Those are the same thing only
when the model ships a clip for the requested slot. When it does not, the request falls back — and
**`moveStop` is a one-shot, emitted the instant you stop moving, that falls back to `idle`** on any model
without a stop clip. So `LoopOnce + clampWhenFinished` was stamped onto the IDLE action, which played once,
froze on its final frame, and stayed there: every later idle request hits the `animState === key` early
return and never resets it. Running asks for a different key. **That is exactly why moving away recovers it.**

On a basic model (idle/walk/run) the real fallback table sends **many** one-shots onto looping slots, several
onto idle itself — `test-1304` enumerates them rather than asserting the one case. The loop mode now comes
from the resolved slot; a creator's explicit override still wins, looked up under the requested name first
and the resolved slot second — **which also repairs build 1294's per-weapon clip speed**, whose
`attack@crowbar` entries had been silently missing every lookup here.

**NOT REPRODUCED HEADLESS, and that is worth stating.** The stock level's third-person body is the stylised
capsule, which carries no `stateActions` at all — there is nothing to freeze. The probe returned
`{err:'no actions'}` on every swing. This one is reasoned from the code and driven against the real fallback
tables; it wants a browser confirmation with a rigged character.

## The editor panel latched itself shut (build 1302)

Reported from play: *"the weapons editor is getting stuck. If I select one weapon, say shotgun, the stats
section stays on shotgun no matter what other weapon I choose."*

**It was not the weapons editor. It was every field in the inspector, and it had been there since build
1070.** `renderEditorFields` throttles to one rebuild per 8 ms and defers the rest to `requestAnimationFrame`
behind a `_refQueued` latch. The deferred pass set `_refLast = performance.now()` and **then** called the
function that opens by asking whether `now - _refLast < 8`. It always was, by microseconds. So the deferred
pass re-latched, queued another frame, and did the same on that one — an infinite self-rescheduling loop
that rendered nothing, with `_refQueued` stuck true so every later call returned at the first line.

**Two clicks inside one animation frame was all it took**, which is exactly what picking two weapons in
quick succession is. After that the panel showed whatever it had last drawn, forever, and no further
interaction recovered it. Reproduced live before fixing: `curWep` 'pistol' with the panel showing shotgun's
650 ms and the latch true; five slow clicks afterwards changed nothing.

`_refLast = 0` rather than deleting the line: the deferred pass must be **guaranteed** through the window,
not merely likely. Dropping it works at 60 Hz (16 ms > 8) and fails at 120 Hz (8.3 ms) — the sort of "fixed
on my machine" this file has been bitten by before. `test-1302` drives the real throttle with a controllable
clock at 4 / 8.3 / 11 / 16 / 33 ms frames and asserts one frame drains the queue.

**And test-240 failed on a CHARACTER BUDGET** — `sI < 900` — while its assertion stayed true, which is build
1149's recorded trap arriving again. It now asserts the ORDER it actually means: the scroll capture sits
after build 818's coalescing gate and before the first rebuild.

## Variable jump height (build 1301 — gameplay audit F6)

> Greped `jumpCut`, `shortHop`, `holdJump`, `varJump` → zero hits, and the jump is one assignment
> (`player.vel.y = JUMP`) with no release handling. **Every jump is exactly 2.82 m.** Rumpus advertises a
> side-scroll mode with a lane lock — a 2.5D platformer where you cannot tap for a short hop is missing the
> primary verb of the genre.

Releasing while RISING now cuts the remaining ascent. **Height goes as v², so one setting spans the whole
tap-to-hold range** without a second constant: the shipped `jumpCut: 0.5` is half the launch velocity and
therefore a quarter of the height — a 0.71 m hop against the 2.82 m hold.

**Why this is safe for levels that already exist**, which is the question any movement change has to answer:
it can only ever shorten a jump the player *chose* to release early, and **a player attempting a demanding
jump holds the key** — that is the natural input when you are trying to clear something. A jump puzzle that
needs the full 2.82 m is still cleared by holding, exactly as before. `jumpCut: 1` restores the old engine
byte-for-byte, and the slider says which end that is.

Two details the test found rather than confirmed:
- **A cut of exactly 0 swallows the jump.** It zeroes the rising velocity, so the player never leaves the
  ground and the input vanishes. `JUMP_CUT_MIN = 0.1` floors it — a 2.8 cm hop is effectively none, but you
  still leave the floor. A slider that can silently eat an input is worse than one that cannot quite reach
  its own extreme.
- **The apex is frame-rate dependent, and that is the integrator, not this build.** Semi-implicit Euler at a
  real frame time lands ~0.10 m under the analytic `v²/2g` at 60 fps and further at 20. So `test-1301`
  asserts the **tap-to-hold RATIO** across 8–50 ms steps — the quantity this build actually decides — rather
  than an absolute height it does not own. Stating the assertion on the wrong quantity is how a test ends up
  guarding someone else's behaviour.

Still absent and deliberately not added here: double jump, wall jump, dash, air-dash. Each is its own verb
with its own tuning and its own compatibility question; F6 named them together but they are not one build.

## The Level Check takes you to the problem (build 1300 — editor audit 4.3, HIGH)

> `renderLevelIssues`: `d.textContent = msg`, no handler. *"A signal targets tag 'vaultDoor', but no prop
> carries that tag"* is a great message with nowhere to click. The outliner already searches by tag and
> `selectAssetInstances` already knows how to select-and-frame — the two are three lines apart.

**The locator rides BESIDE the message rather than replacing it.** `levelIssues()` returns an array of
strings, and **ten test harnesses plus the publish preflight** consume it that way; turning it into objects
to carry one extra field would have rewritten all of them for no gain. So the check that RAISES an issue
registers how to find it, keyed by the message it just produced, and the panel looks it up. Two identical
messages share a locator, which is correct — they name the same tag.

Seven raise-sites now point somewhere: the four signal faults (the prop carrying the signal is the loop
variable, right there), both cutscene faults, and the CC-BY attribution one — which registers a **finder**
rather than a snapshot, so it re-resolves the actual props at click time. The rest are level-wide; a light
budget or a missing key pad has no single prop to blame, and those stay plain rows. **A dead-looking click
is worse than none.**

**It resolves at CLICK time, not at check time.** A prop can be deleted between opening the panel and
pressing the arrow, and *"that prop is no longer in the level"* is a better answer than selecting a ghost. A
throwing resolver is a refusal, not a crash out of a click handler.

Verified end to end in the real editor by authoring the audit's exact fault — a signal pointing at
`vaultDoor` with no prop carrying it. The message appears, the row is clickable with an arrow, pressing it
selects and frames the culprit and switches to the props tab; deleting the prop first leaves the click
harmless.

**Five old harnesses broke, and correctly.** 241/246/248/252/254 execute `levelIssues` in an EMPTY scope, so
a new module-level dependency is genuinely missing there — they now supply an inert recorder. That is the
suite working: a rig that evaluates a function outside the file has to be told when the function's
dependencies change.

## The inspector ignored the selection (build 1299 — editor audit 4.2, CRITICAL)

Verified still live before touching it. The audit's words:

> The gizmo is group-aware, the material fold is group-aware and *says so*, and the tag field, interact,
> signals, name and dialogue are all primary-only with no indication. Two different rules for one selection,
> in adjacent folds. A creator who tags 30 crates one at a time will conclude the editor is fine; a creator
> who assumes the fields follow the selection will silently corrupt their level.

**The fix is not "make everything group-aware".** Some of those fields are per-object by nature. It is that
every field states which rule it follows:
- **Mark-the-set fields** — tag, interactable, lock — apply to the whole selection. For `tag` that was always
  the intent: a signal resolves a tag to a **list** of props at runtime, so one tag across thirty crates is
  the normal authoring move, not an edge case. Thirty doors and one key, likewise.
- **Per-object fields** — an NPC's name and its dialogue script — stay on the primary and now **say so**.
  Thirty characters with one name and one speech is not something anyone wants by accident.

*Silent inconsistency was the bug; labelled asymmetry is a design.* Every fold that can face a
multi-selection now carries a banner naming its rule, in a different colour per rule — the same colour for
opposite rules would have been the original bug in a new costume.

`_selApply` takes **one undo snapshot per gesture**, not per object: per-object would cost thirty Ctrl+Z
presses to undo one edit. It also keeps going past a throwing field handler, so a bad prop cannot leave a
selection half-applied. And `_selTargets` deliberately does NOT filter to material primitives the way
`_matTargets` does — an imported GLB carries tags, locks and interact flags just like a box.

Measured through the real editor (`toggleEditor` → Build mode → select five props): the banner reads
*"Editing 5 selected props — changes apply to all"*, and one tag edit tagged **five**.

## The 20Hz stream had no brakes (build 1298)

The peer connection is `reliable:true` — ordered SCTP — and the host fans a world snapshot to every client
20 times a second, with the client answering at the same rate. Across **53 `send` sites, nothing had ever
looked at `bufferedAmount`.**

On a link that cannot drain 20 Hz, a reliable channel does not drop packets — it **QUEUES them, without
bound**. Every later message (a hit, a chat line, the next keyframe) waits behind the backlog, so the
connection does not degrade gracefully: it slides into ever-growing latency and never recovers. That is the
classic *"everything went to slow motion and stayed there"* multiplayer failure, and it is **invisible in
every LAN test**, because the queue never builds.

**A state snapshot is the one message safe to drop** — the next one supersedes it. Hits, chat, joins, the
level transfer and prop sync are semantic events and still send unconditionally; `test-1298` pins that
`_sendDroppable` appears at exactly two call sites and nowhere else, because a silently-skipped event is a
far worse bug than the one this fixes.

**The threshold is stated in SNAPSHOTS, not bytes**, because bytes are a property of the level. Measured on
the stock level (1 enemy, 59 props): keyframe **557 B**, delta **325 B**, ~6.8 KB/s — and that is the floor,
a populated match is many times it. So the limit is `max(16 KB, payloadBytes × 8)`: eight snapshots deep is
**400 ms of backlog at 20 Hz whatever the level weighs**, with a floor so a small level does not trip on
ordinary jitter.

Two details:
- **A skip forces the next snapshot to be a keyframe.** Build 1197's snapshots are deltas against one shared
  previous state, so a client that misses one is stale until the next keyframe — up to nine snapshots
  (450 ms). `_snapN = 0` makes the next one full (the counter is incremented *before* the modulo, which the
  test executes rather than assumes), and because every client reads the same payload, one keyframe repairs
  all of them at once. 450 ms → 50 ms.
- **A transport that will not answer is treated as HEALTHY.** `_netBuffered` returns 0 on a missing channel,
  a non-numeric answer or a throwing getter. Guessing the other way stops a connection sending, which is
  worse than the queue this exists to bound.

**One earlier claim retired while checking this.** The open work listed "reliable-ordered WebRTC transport"
as a heavyweight; the channel already *is* reliable and ordered (`p.connect(host, { reliable:true })`). The
real gap was never ordering — it was that nothing bounded the queue that ordering creates.

## A bot holding a sword shot bullets (build 1297)

Checked immediately after 1296, because that build made a configuration reachable that might be broken
downstream — and it was, and it had been for a long time. A PvP bot's engagement range came from the
DIFFICULTY table (`D.range`) and its shot from `remoteFire`, which spawns a tracer and a hit for every peer.
Its stand-off came from `prefRange`, 6-15 m — a rifle's answer. So a bot with a crowbar stood at rifle range
landing **invisible shots** while holding a blunt object, and never closed.

This predates 1296: the bot weapon pick ends `|| 'crowbar'`, so a host who allows nothing else already got
melee bots. 1296 made it one checkbox away in every level, which is why it was worth finding now.

Now `prefRange` is the weapon's own reach × 0.7, the attack gate is the reach, and the melee branch spawns
no projectile — just the attack pose, which **build 1294 resolves to `attack@<weapon>`**, so the creator's
own swing clip plays with no extra plumbing. Three builds composing without any of them knowing about the
others is the payoff for keeping each one's mechanism generic.

**Damage deliberately stays on the difficulty table.** A bot's damage has never come from its weapon — a
sniper bot and a pistol bot hit for the same — and making melee the one exception would be a stealth
rebalance of every existing match. Only the RANGE and the DELIVERY changed.

**The test found a real hole in my first draft, and it is the interesting part.** `prefRange` had a floor of
1.2 m and `GUN_STAT_LIM.reach` a floor of 0.5, so a creator could author a 0.5 m weapon whose bots close to
1.2 m — *outside their own reach* — and swing forever. Two independent constants that had to satisfy an
inequality nobody had written down. They are now declared together as `BOT_MELEE_REACH_MIN = 1.2` and
`BOT_MELEE_MIN = 1.0`, with the inequality stated where they live, and `test-1297` sweeps the ENTIRE
authorable range rather than three hand-picked values to prove `max(1.0, 0.7r) < r` for every r. The
original three-value spot check passed; the sweep is what caught it.

## Melee is a per-weapon stat, so any slot can be a sword (build 1296)

Following the same report as 1294/1295: a creator wants *a pistol, a sword, an axe and a rifle*. Build 1240
answered that report with **renaming** and 1190 made the stat sheet **authorable** — but `melee` and `reach`
were in neither list, so the SMG could be renamed SWORD and it still fired bullets. Exactly ONE slot shipped
as a usable melee weapon (`crowbar`; `hands` is the bare-fist loadout), so **the sword and the axe were
competing for the same slot.**

**Adding the two keys to 1190's `GUN_STAT_KEYS` array IS the feature.** The only-changed serializer, all
three loaders, the per-stat reset-to-factory buttons and the clamps already operate on any key in it — that
is what build 1190 was for, and it paid off here. `melee` rides as 0/1 so it needs no separate boolean path;
every reader already asks `if(w.melee)`.

Measured live, authoring two melee weapons through the real `_wepApplyStats` and firing the real `shoot()`
at a crate:
```
SWORD (smg)      melee 1  reach 3.2   55 damage
AXE (shotgun)    melee 1  reach 3.8  110
CROWBAR          melee 1  reach 3.4   60   (unchanged)
RIFLE            melee 0              12   (still a gun, still the bullet path)
```

Two details are load-bearing:
- **The live values are NORMALISED where the baseline is captured.** `melee` ships as `true`/undefined and
  `reach` is absent on every gun; the serializer emits a stat whenever it differs from its baseline, so
  leaving `true` beside a baseline of `1` would write a phantom melee override into every level ever saved.
  A gun's baseline `reach` is the crowbar's 3.4, so flipping the flag yields a usable weapon rather than one
  with zero reach.
- **The editor's stat sheet was hidden outright for melee weapons** (`if(!WEAPONS[curWep].melee)`), which is
  why even the crowbar's own reach and swing speed were unauthorable. It now shows for every weapon, with
  the field list switching: reach + swing interval for a melee weapon, the seven gun stats otherwise.

**And it exposed a real pre-existing bug.** `applyAttachments` did `Math.max(1, Math.round(base.magSize *
r.magMul))` — build 583, written when every weapon had a magazine. So the crowbar and the fists were handed
a **1-round magazine**, which then differed from the captured baseline and made `serializeLevel` write a
spurious `st:{magSize:1}` into **every level saved since build 1190**. It matters more now: a creator sets
their sword's magazine to 0 and this put it straight back. Now `(base.magSize > 0) ? Math.max(1, …) : 0` —
the floor still does its real job (a multiplier must never round a real magazine away) but does not invent
one. `GUN_STAT_LIM.pellets` moved from `[1,24]` to `[0,24]` for the same reason.

**Three probe runs were lost to the rig before any of this measured, and the third is the one to remember:
the pose must be set a FRAME BEFORE the swing.** `meleeAttack` takes its direction from
`camera.getWorldDirection`, and the camera only picks up a new `player.yaw` in the frame loop — so teleport
and swing in one synchronous block and the swing aims wherever the camera was already looking, which reads
*exactly* like "the weapon does no damage". (The other two: the stock level ships no dynamic props at all,
and the prop I first repurposed is a 16-unit floor slab, so the ray started inside it — front faces only,
no hit.) None of the three looks like a rig failure; all three read as the feature being broken, which was
the answer I was already expecting.

## One attack animation for the whole arsenal (build 1294)

Reported: *"the editor doesn't allow different attack animations per weapon. I have to choose one animation
for the left mouse button and it is used for every weapon. If the player switches from a pistol, to a sword,
to an axe, to a rifle, those should all be different."* Correct — `ANIM_SLOTS` carried ONE `attack` slot and
all three animators (local avatar, remote player, bot) asked for it by that literal name.

**A variant is the slot name with the weapon appended: `attack@crowbar`.** That choice is the whole reason
this is small — `clips`, `clipSpeed`, `clipHold` and `clipInPlace` are plain maps keyed by slot string, so a
variant rides through the character config, the save file and the network snapshot with **no format change**;
`myCharCfg` already copies the whole `clips` object, so a co-op peer sees your sword swing without a protocol
bump, and `w:rp.wep` was already in the snapshot so every animator knows which weapon to ask for.

Four decisions:
- **The resolver is one line.** `_stateActionKey` walks `_ANIM_FALLBACK`; it now peels a `@` qualifier first,
  so `attack@pistol` → `attack` → `aim` → `idle` with no new table entries. **An unmapped variant therefore
  resolves to exactly what it resolved to before this build** — that is the compatibility argument, and it
  is executed rather than asserted.
- **Explicit only, no name auto-match.** A clip called "SwordSwing" guessing its way onto a slot is the kind
  of magic that cannot be debugged. A variant becomes an action only when a creator maps it.
- **Loop mode comes from the BASE slot.** `attack@crowbar` is a one-shot because `attack` is one. Making each
  variant restate it is the version that fails silently on the twentieth weapon.
- **`equip` gets it too**, using the weapon being switched TO — drawing a sword is not drawing a pistol.
  `WEP_ANIM_SLOTS` is `['attack','equip']`, and that list is a UI budget, not a capability: the resolver is
  generic, so `walkFire@sniper` works the moment anyone maps it.

Verified through the REAL editor path (`toggleEditor` → `setEditorMode('player')`), because builds 1266/1268
shipped a fix whose call site sat in a camera branch no creator reaches — 16 selects present, correct state
keys, and the live animator asking for `attack@pistol` / `attack@crowbar` / `attack@rifle` as the weapon changes.

## Melee could never break a prop in third person (build 1295)

Reported in the same breath: *"if I give the player a sword as a melee weapon, I can't break/explode props if
I swing at it."* Three faults in one block of `meleeAttack`, all from it having been written for a
first-person solo punch and never revisited. **The enemy cone twenty lines above already does all three
things right**, which is exactly what made the difference invisible: enemies took the hit, props did not.

1. **It cast from the CAMERA and range-limited on the distance from the CAMERA.** The reach is 2.9 m and the
   third-person boom sits 4.2 m behind, so anything within reach of the *player* is at least 4.2 m from the
   camera. Measured on one crate 1.5 m in front:
   ```
                  camera->prop   player->prop   old test
   first person       1.5            1.5          HITS
   third person       5.7            1.5          MISSES
   ```
   **`tpDist > MELEE_RANGE` is the entire bug in one comparison** — no prop, at any distance, in any third-
   person level, has ever been breakable by a swing.
2. **It aimed through screen centre**, ignoring the cursor-aim correction its own cone applies (builds
   874/1103), so in the twin-stick and chase-cursor views it swung wherever the camera pointed.
3. **A client could not do it at all** — `NET.mode!=='client'` skipped the block, while the bullet path has
   always relayed `propHit` to the host. In co-op the host's swing worked and a guest's did nothing, which
   nobody reports as a bug; they just conclude melee is decorative.

After: the real swing deals the crowbar's full 60 damage in both views. The swing gets **its own** module-scope
raycaster, because the reach has to be its `far` and setting that on the shared `raycaster` would leak the
limit into a dozen other systems.

**Two probe runs were lost to the rig, both worth remembering.** The stock level ships NO dynamic props, so
the first run measured nothing; and the prop I then repurposed is a 16-unit floor slab, so the ray started
*inside* it and three reported no hit at all (front faces only). Neither failure looks like a rig failure —
both read as "the feature is broken", which is the answer I was already expecting.

## The editor panel stopped rebuilding what nobody can see (build 1293)

Build 1291 made undo fast and named what was left: `serializeLevel` and `renderEditorFields`. Measured,
the split is not close — `serializeLevel` is **5.8 ms** and `renderEditorFields` is **26.7 ms**, and the
second one runs on every selection change, every field edit and every gizmo release, not only on undo.

`renderEditorFields` tears down and re-creates the WHOLE panel: every mode's sections, whichever mode is
showing. Probed in the real editor, in Build mode — the default, and where every drag and selection
happens — the Environment, Enemies, Objectives, Crosshair and Loot hosts hold **1,867 DOM nodes between
them and every single one is off screen**, destroyed and rebuilt on every call.

```
                  render      panel nodes
Build mode        26.7 ms  ->  8.1 ms      5,191 -> 3,150
Scene / Enemies / Rules / HUD   unchanged — those modes show the sections, so they build them
Kit / Files / Settings          2.7-3.2 ms
```

**The gate is `offsetParent === null`, not a section-to-mode map.** That is exactly "display:none somewhere
above me", so it covers the mode filter (`applyEditorMode` sets `display` per `.edSection`) and the
collapsed fold (`.edSection.collapsed .edSecBody { display:none }`) without this function knowing which is
which. A map would need updating every time a section moved, and would be wrong silently.

Three things make it safe, and all three are asserted:
- **All-or-nothing per group.** Those five hosts are built INTERLEAVED across 3,000 lines by helpers that
  take a host argument, so gating each one would push a null host into every build site. Any one visible
  builds all five. Less aggressive, and a section can never be half-built.
- **Expanding a fold now re-renders.** Nothing called this on a fold toggle before, because the content was
  always there. Only on expand — collapsing reveals nothing, and rebuilding there is the cost being removed.
- **Every error path answers "build it".** A panel that builds too much is a slow editor; one that builds
  too little is an empty one.

`setEditorMode` already did `applyEditorMode()` *then* `renderEditorFields()` — reveal, then build. That
order was incidental before and is load-bearing now, so it is pinned.

**Finding the real structure took two wrong probes, both recorded in `tools/probe/README.md`'s spirit.**
The first drove `editorActive` directly and concluded the World tab "did not come back" — but `#edTabs` is
the TARGET picker (props/lights/spawns), not the section list, so that click did nothing. The second called
`renderEditorFields` twice in a row and read a zero: the function rate-limits itself to one build per 8 ms
and defers the rest to `requestAnimationFrame`, so the second call never ran. **Measuring through a
rate-limiter reads exactly like measuring a fix that works.**

## The bloom threshold was measuring the wrong thing (build 1292)

The bloom prefilter thresholds the luminance of `_postRT`, which holds the scene **after** three has applied
`toneMappingExposure` and the ACES fit. Build 1180 then made that exposure MOVE at runtime by up to 1.5
stops. So the fixed threshold was never selecting highlights — it was selecting *whatever the eye had
currently adapted to*, and the fraction of the frame that blooms breathed with the adaptation.

Measured live, ONE pose, one level, exposure the only variable:
```
exposure           1.00    1.25    1.60    1.90
threshold used    0.5442  0.6200  0.6954  0.7415
% blooming, OLD    0.02%   5.49%  20.23%  43.13%     <- fixed 0.62
% blooming, NEW    5.53%   5.49%   5.44%   5.43%     <- derived
```
**A 2000x swing becomes flat to a tenth of a percentage point**, and at the authored exposure the derived
value is *exactly* the authored number — so no level is retuned and nothing needs migrating.

The fix states the threshold in the space where it means something — SCENE luminance, before exposure — and
re-derives the comparison value each frame: `uThresh = F( Finv(postThresh) * expNow / expBase )`. `F` is
r149's own `RRTAndODTFit`, and `test-1292` checks every one of its five constants against the real
`ShaderChunk`, so a three upgrade that retunes the curve fails loudly instead of silently detuning every
adapted frame. The full ACES path also applies colour matrices; those are near luminance-preserving (each
row sums to ~1, exact for neutrals, a few percent off on saturated colour), which is well inside what a
luminance threshold needs.

**I got this wrong first, and the way it was wrong is the point.** Three camera poses on the stock level
showed 22%, 37% and 39% of the frame blooming, and I read that as "the threshold is too low — raise the
default". Those three poses confounded exposure with what was in shot. The one-pose sweep above disproves
it: at the authored 1.25 the shipped 0.62 is **correct**, giving a 5.5% highlight budget. Nothing needed
retuning; something needed to carry the threshold along when the exposure it was tuned against started
moving. *Three cameras is not a control. One variable is.*

**Two other hypotheses died on the way here, both worth recording so they are not re-run:**
- *"Make the post chain HDR."* The rendering audit's structural claim — ACES applies inside every material,
  so bloom cannot tell a 3x lamp from a 1000x sun — is true of the code. Measured in scene-linear on real
  frames, the content has no such range: max radiance 2.66 with **0.02% of pixels above 1.0**, and raising
  the sun 5.3x moved the max to 1.04. There is no HDR there to preserve.
- *"Invert the tone curve in the bloom prefilter so selection happens in linear."* `Finv` is **monotonic**,
  so the set of pixels above the threshold is IDENTICAL either way. Checked before building it; it would
  have been hours for a byte-identical frame. The weights shift slightly (a 7x relative weighting becomes
  6x), which is not the difference between a wash and a highlight.

**The instrument failed twice first, and only the control caught it.** Reading `_postRT` directly returns
all zeros — it is MULTISAMPLED (build 1182 already had to blit through `_matCopy` for exactly this reason).
Rendering into an own target instead *also* returned all zeros, **control included**, because a HalfFloat
target read into a `Float32Array` yields nothing here; `FloatType` reads back. Without a known clear colour
read through the identical path, "0% of the frame blooms" would have been published as a measured fact —
which is build 1152's lesson arriving for the seventh time. `tools/probe/` now carries the rig and that
list, in the repo, because it had been rebuilt from memory three times in one session.

## Undo stopped reloading the level (build 1291)

Every Ctrl+Z ran `restoreLevel` — a full teardown and respawn of every prop, light, zone and marker, with
each imported model re-fetched or re-cloned and re-materialised. So nudging a crate and undoing it cost the
same as **loading the level**, on the step the editor's core rhythm (tweak, undo, tweak again) repeats
constantly. Build 1163 had already had to bolt a by-nid reselect onto the far side because the rebuild threw
the selection away — the shape of a workaround for a step that should not have been happening.

Measured live in the real editor, stock 56-prop scene, undoing one nudge. **Two figures, and only the second
is what a creator feels:**
```
the step replaced   restoreLevel 74.33 ms  ->  _applyUndoMoves 0.44 ms   169x
the whole Ctrl+Z    108.5 ms               ->  24.4 ms                   4.4x
```
The gap is `serializeLevel()` (unavoidable — the state being left is what makes the redo possible) and
`renderEditorFields()`. Those are the floor now, they were already being paid, and naming them is where the
next build looks. That scene has no imported models; the reload side is far worse with them and this side
does not change at all.

**The fast path is deliberately narrow, and the narrowness is the safety.** It applies only when the two
states differ in NOTHING except prop transforms — an add, a delete, a reorder, a material, a signal, a world
setting, a model swap all fall through to the old reload, unchanged. So this cannot introduce a class of
"undo didn't fully undo": either the diff is exactly a set of transforms, or the old path runs.

Three details are load-bearing:
- **The comparison is by EXCLUSION.** It strips `t` from each prop and compares the rest whole, then strips
  `props` and compares the level whole. The other direction — enumerating the fields allowed to differ — is
  the version that silently goes wrong the first time somebody adds a prop field. `test-1291` proves an
  unknown future key REFUSES rather than being ignored. Both sides come from the same `serializeLevel`, so
  key order matches and a string compare is a true deep compare; that assumption is written down.
- **An entry with no `nid` disqualifies the whole diff.** Identity is what links a transform to an object;
  without it the index is the only link and a silent mismatch writes a transform onto the wrong prop.
- **Every object is resolved before any is moved**, and the apply is wrapped so a throw falls back to the
  reload — which rebuilds from the snapshot anyway, so a partial apply cannot survive.

The write is the gizmo drag's own sequence (position/rotation/scale → `retileProcSurface` → `refreshPropCollider`
→ `_homeSync`), so a transform arrived at by undo is identical to one dragged. `performUndo` and `performRedo`
are now **one** `_historyStep` in opposite directions, which is why 1129's and 1163's pins each moved from two
assertions to one — stronger, not weaker: the two directions can no longer drift apart.

**Verified end to end by OBJECT IDENTITY**, which is the cheap way to prove a reload did not happen: after
undoing a move, `propByNid(nid)` returns the SAME JS object and `selProps` still holds it; redo puts it back;
and undoing a TAG edit returns a *different* object — the reload correctly running. Rotation and scale
round-trip too.

## The ledge grab probes where the character is GOING (build 1290)

Found while reading 1289, verified with the same rig, and it is a whole game mode: the grab gate was
`wish.dot(forward) > 0.5`, and `forward` is the movement BASIS. Build 874 makes that basis SCREEN-relative in
the fixed-camera views, and side-scroll sets it to the **literal zero vector** (the lane lives in `right`).
So the gate was `0 > 0.5` on every frame and **a 2.5D platformer could not ledge-grab at all** — the single
most genre-defining verb a side-scroller has. With build 1103's cursor aim the basis is the FROZEN camera yaw
while the body runs wherever the stick points, so the probe went where the camera looked, not where the
character was going.

Measured, side view, same box and approach, control pair:
```
before   the player runs straight past the box, NO GRAB on any frame
after    hang at hy 1.75, grab direction +X, _ledge.yaw -1.57 (facing the wall it grabbed)
```
First and third person re-measured after the change: **1.75 in both, unchanged** — the first-person test is
deliberately untouched, because that is the view where the grab must also mean *toward where you are looking*,
which is what makes it deliberate rather than accidental there.

Three things beyond the gate had to follow the same direction, and each is a bug on its own:
- **All five probes** — the reach scan, the contact point, 966's wall-face walk, the chest anchor and the
  pull-up landing spot. A test asserts that nothing in the block still reads the raw basis, because one probe
  landing somewhere else than the other four is a hang anchored to a wall that was never found.
- **The hang yaw.** 966 faced the body along `player.yaw`, which in the twin-stick views points at the
  CURSOR. It is now `atan2(-gx, -gz)` — the inverse of the engine's `(-sin yaw, -cos yaw)` forward, so it
  round-trips exactly.
- **The drop.** It stepped back along whatever the basis pointed at *that* frame; it now backs off the wall
  the record remembers, falling back to the basis so an in-flight record from before this build still behaves.

Six pins moved (493, 966, 1243, 1244 plus 1289's own two), all keeping their assertions' intent.

**Left open, with numbers, because it is a real defect and NOT the reported one.** `centerLocal.y` is the
drawn body's own centre — hardcoded 1.0 for the capsule, `yoff + h*0.5` for an imported model. So the chase
camera's pivot is HALF THE MODEL'S HEIGHT: the same level plays with a different sight line depending on
which character is equipped, and there is no authored control over it (`tpHeight` offsets the camera, not
the pivot). For humanoids the spread is small (a 1.8 m model gives 0.9 against the capsule's 1.0); for the
non-humanoids this engine happily imports it is not (a 0.5 m creature gives 0.25, a 4 m mech gives 2.0).
That is the same fault class as 1289 — a gameplay quantity derived from the art — and it wants its own build
with a compatibility story, because every level that has already tuned `tpHeight` did so against this pivot.


## Open work (as of build 1203) — THE CRITIC ROADMAP IS COMPLETE

Every item from the six-critic review panel (build 1159's `scratchpad/critics/ROADMAP.md`) has shipped or
died on verification. Phase 4's final stretch: 1188 collider grid, 1189 PvE cover/flank, 1190 weapon
sheet, 1191 enemy tuning, 1192 model instancing, 1193 effect zones, 1194 incremental Rapier statics, 1195
in-editor lighting bake, 1196 cutscene shot events (the logic graph is the sequencer — this is the "actor
tracks" answer), 1197 delta/keyframe snapshots (relevancy filtering REJECTED with a reason), 1198/1199
auto-exposure stability (soft knee; HDRI out of the AO G-buffer), 1200+1202 two-layer nav with dirty
patches, 1201 host migration, 1203 collider derivation in a worker.

Still open, each with its reason:
- **Per-player variables** — FIRST SLICE SHIPPED (build 1231): trigger + onkill events carry pid/team,
  `name@` variables scope per player. Remaining: actor-targeted verbs (heal/give/teleport the event's
  player) need a host→client effect message; more event sources (interact, objective edges) can adopt
  `_lgPlayerEvent` incrementally.
- Verification kills already recorded (do not revisit): texture slots on primitives (871-era), bot
  bullet tracers (1020), cell-hash enemy separation (arithmetic — not a hotspot), relevancy snapshot
  filtering (per-client serialization × N costs more than it saves at ≤60 entities).
- **Browser verifications the harness cannot do** are accumulating for the user — see the release-blocker
  list ("What only a human can verify") plus: AE on HDRI with AO up (1199), two-machine host-drop
  migration (1201), a big-GLB import hitch before/after (1203), bots pathing onto a roof (1200/1202).

Generator roadmap: footprints + texture budget (done, 1110) → interiors (done, 1111) → multi-storey
(done, 1113) → more themes/materials (done, 1114) → emit gameplay data with the GLB (started,
1124: `info.spawns`).

**Shadow parameters are TEXEL quantities (build 1125).** `normalBias` is a world-space offset whose
correct size is a few texels of `2 * extent / mapSize`. Build 1095 tuned it to 0.6 against the fixed
±80 volume (7.7 texels); build 1120 made the volume `shadowDist` and the constant silently became
~20 texels — longer than the whole ground shadow a crate casts at noon. `_sunNormalBias(extent, px)`
is now the single derivation, used at boot and on every re-fit. `moon.shadow.bias` is a DEPTH bias
against an unchanged near/far and deliberately does NOT scale with it. If you touch the shadow
volume again, check what else was tuned against its old size.

**Gameplay data with the GLB.** Build 1124 added the first piece — `buildArena` returns
`spawns: [[x,z],[x,z]]` (BASE 1, BASE 2), the worker carries it back beside `world`, and *Place in
level* moves `playerSpawn` there facing the centre. The engine's forward is `(-sin yaw, -cos yaw)`,
so facing the origin from `(x,z)` is `atan2(x, z)` — `atan2(-x,-z)` looks the wrong way (there is
an instance of the wrong form in the maze generator, untouched). Next candidates, same channel:
enemy spawn markers at the arena's cover positions, the ramp centrelines (`scans`) as bot routes,
and pickup spots.

No known geometry bugs: both of the build-1112 repros (multi-storey stairs pushing enemies, the
cover crate clipping a ramp mouth) are fixed and covered by tests.

Themes are DATA (build 1114): a palette entry names its materials plus the treatments it wants —
`dress`, `joinery`, `plaza`, `yard`, `foliage`, `lightCol`, `depot`, `names` — and `buildArena`
contains no `theme === ...` branch. Adding the eighth theme is one `arenaPalette` entry, one
`arenaMood` entry, whatever new treatment names it introduces, and the editor's theme list.

**`GRID_PAD` / `BOT_LANE` are now a MARGIN, not a requirement (build 1148).** The engine's collider is
tight to the triangles, so the generator no longer has to author a 3.8 m doorway to get a 1.6 m one.
Narrowing them is a *generator* change with its own probe pass — do not do it as part of an engine
build, and keep `tests/test-1113` as the gate.

**The arena-edge seam was never a seam. CLOSED — I was measuring a light.** Four builds of hypotheses about
why the desert arena's ground reads 2.3 stops brighter than the engine plane beside it, and the answer is
that the bright strip is the arena's **team-A base marker**: `mat('teamA', { base: [1, 0.55, 0.23],
glow: 0.32 })` — a deliberately EMISSIVE gameplay marking painted along the base edge. It is supposed to be
bright. I picked the sample region off a screenshot by eye at y 395–406 and never checked what mesh was
there until a probe reported `col=1.000/0.550/0.230` with `glow`.

The scene-linear radiance probe (`scratchpad/probe-radiance.mjs`) settles it in one run. Rendering the live
scene into a **FloatType** render target with `toneMapping = NoToneMapping` gives the radiance the renderer
actually produced, before ACES and before the encode, so `radiance / albedo` is the IRRADIANCE a surface
received — and two surfaces in the same sunlight must report the same number:

```
surface                       radiance              albedo               IRRADIANCE
arena edge strip (teamA)   1.871/1.110/0.436   1.000/0.550/0.230    1.87/2.02/1.89   <- EMISSIVE
engine boundary wall       0.140/0.120/0.082   0.068/0.058/0.045    2.04/2.07/1.81
                           0.145/0.120/0.083   0.068/0.058/0.045    2.11/2.08/1.84
                           0.140/0.116/0.079   0.068/0.058/0.045    2.04/2.01/1.74
```
**The irradiance is identical.** The renderer was delivering the same light all along; the 14.6× ratio in red
is albedo, and one of the two albedos belongs to an emitter. In hindsight every eliminated hypothesis was
eliminated *because* the surface was emissive — zeroing the bake and closing the 8× `envMapIntensity` gap
both left it byte-identical, which is exactly what an emitter does.

Three lessons, and the first is the one that cost the most:
- **Know what SURFACE you are measuring before you call it a defect.** Build 1124 established "know where
  the camera is before you judge the frame"; this is the same error one level down. A region picked by eye
  off a screenshot is a guess about geometry, and here it was wrong twice: the surface I had been calling
  "the engine's ground plane" reports `env0.12` and no `src`, which makes it **`wallMat`** — the engine's
  boundary WALL, not its floor. Both halves of a comparison I ran for four builds were misidentified.
- **`radiance / albedo` is irradiance only for a NON-EMISSIVE material.** The probe's own first run made
  this mistake, reading 1.87 off the marker as if it were ground irradiance. It now prints
  `EMISSIVE!x<intensity> (IRR above is NOT irradiance)` so the next reader cannot repeat it.
- **Frame statistics cannot test a lighting hypothesis.** Comparing a post-ACES 8-bit value against an
  albedo-times-irradiance estimate mixes two spaces and every approximation in the chain is worth a factor.
  Four rounds of that produced four wrong answers; one float-target read produced the right one. When the
  question is about the render equation, measure in the render equation's own space.

**The confirming run added the first sun-to-shade measured in SCENE-LINEAR space.** A vertical fan of nine
samples down one third of the frame: eight hit the same engine surface (`env0.12`, roughness 0.85,
metalness 0.08) and one of those eight is in shadow. Same material, same frame, so the ratio is the light
alone — and unlike every earlier figure it is read before ACES, so no tone curve is folded into it:

```
                  radiance              IRRADIANCE          per channel
lit    0.1385/0.1371/0.0911   2.022/2.371/2.016
shade  0.0245/0.0441/0.0391   0.358/0.763/0.866   R 5.6:1   G 3.1:1   B 2.3:1
```
**The ratio is strongly per-channel: red loses 5.6× going into shade, blue only 2.3×.** That is build 1149's
finding, independently and properly measured: a shadow lit only by a blue sky keeps its blue and loses its
red, which is why the fix had to be a WARM bounce term rather than more ambient of any colour. The
`EMISSIVE!` label also fired correctly on the marker (`x1.00`), so the instrument's own blind spot is closed.

**That loose end is now closed, with no defect.** The eight samples reporting `col = 0.068/0.058/0.045`
turned out to be `WHO[(unnamed)/BoxGeometry|INSTANCED]` — a **batched box primitive**, so its material is
`buildInstancing`'s clone and neither `floorMat` nor `wallMat`. (Build 1139 already recorded the signature: an
`InstancedMesh` hit reports the shared unit-box geometry with a correct world hit point.) I had flagged a
possible "3.4× albedo error in wallMat" as its own build; it does not exist. The generator's colour
round-trip is **exact in all seven themes** — `groundAlb → skyHex → setHex` returns the albedo it started
with, to three decimals:

```
theme        floorColor -> linear      wallColor -> linear     groundAlb        expected wall (x0.55)
desert       0xad9e81  0.418/0.342/0.220   0x847862  0.231/0.188/0.122   0.42/0.34/0.22   0.231/0.187/0.121
frost        0xcbd1da  0.597/0.638/0.701   0x9ba0a7  0.328/0.352/0.386   0.60/0.64/0.70   0.330/0.352/0.385
facility     0x596169  0.100/0.120/0.141   0x42494e  0.054/0.067/0.076   0.10/0.12/0.14   0.055/0.066/0.077
```
Worth keeping because it retires a whole class of suspicion: `skyHex`/`setHex` is not double-encoding
anything, so a future "the colours are wrong somewhere in the transfer" hypothesis can start already knowing
this link is clean. It also cost nothing to check — no browser, one Node call against the real `arenaMood`.

**What the bake A/B established, and it matters more than the seam ever did:****What the bake A/B established, and it matters more than the seam ever did:** the bake carries the arena's block field almost
entirely. With `lightMapIntensity = 0`, the blocks go `148,115,91 → 98,80,65` and their p50 luminance
`0.191 → 0.0496` — a quarter of the light. That is the first quantification of "the bake is the only thing
lighting generated geometry", and it is what build 1150's fix restores on every device whose driver reports
no anisotropic filtering. The `aoMap`/`lightMap` split is still the right eventual decomposition (occlusion
is multiplicative, lamps and bounce are additive) and still needs a texture budget — but it is not a seam
fix, and now there is a number for what removing the bake costs.

**Three things were listed as visible on the stock frame after 1149. All three are now closed, and only one
of them was real.** They are kept here because two were wrong in instructive ways:
- ~~The frame reads MONOCHROME TEAL.~~ **Real, and FIXED in build 1156** — 63.7% of the lower frame was
  blue-dominant and is now 46.6%. The cause was not what this entry said, though: it blamed the albedo being
  blue "under a blue sky", when the actual fault was that the dome's own ground band was already warm and the
  ground plane disagreed with it. The suggested hex (`0x615b53`) happened to land within a few code values of
  the derived answer (`0x5f5a55`) — a lucky guess, not a derivation. See the build 1156 section.
- ~~A hard horizontal SEAM runs across the middle of the frame where the teal floor plane meets an olive
  band.~~ **Wrong — measured and withdrawn.** The largest jump in the frame is the HORIZON, which belongs
  there; the largest one below it is a luminance edge at a platform's shadowed face, unchanged by any colour
  work. There was never a hue seam. Numbers in the build 1156 section.
- ~~The WEAPON is the brightest object in the frame by a wide margin, near-white against a world in the
  110s.~~ **Wrong — measured and withdrawn.** That was written from looking at the frame. The weapon block
  means `91,104,111` against a frame mean of `127,142,152`: it is DARKER than the world behind it. What
  reads as "near-white" is a specular highlight on the top rail's thin edge (`p90 0.209` over a 17-pixel
  strip), which is what a rail edge is supposed to do. Judging a frame by eye is the failure mode the
  Headless capture section exists to prevent, and it caught me writing this list.

Two of three written from looking at the frame, two of three wrong about the mechanism. The list was worth
keeping only because each entry named a capture that could settle it.

Also outstanding (user actions): upload `server/api/plays.php` beside lobbies.php (build 1230's flywheel is client-live but counts nothing until then); upload `tools/levelgen.mjs` + `fflate.min.js` to the cPanel host
for the in-editor generator (see `server/README.md`), and re-upload the museum GLB.

## The broker had no override, and PeerJS was three CDNs (build 1354)

`breach_ice`, `breach_comm_api`, `breach_lobby_db` and `breach_plays_db` each have a self-hoster override.
The **broker** — the single point of failure the entire multiplayer feature depends on — had none. Every
`new Peer(...)` passed only `{config:{iceServers}}`, so signalling always went to the public PeerJS cloud.
"Deploy your own PeerServer" was not merely undocumented: it was **impossible**, because there was no way to
tell the game about one even if it were already running.

And PeerJS itself was three CDNs and nothing else, while Rapier and fflate have been vendored for hundreds
of builds — so a self-hoster, an air-gapped classroom or an offline session had no multiplayer at all.

**`_peerOpts` is why this is four lines rather than four edits.** All four construction sites (host, client,
and both host-migration sites from 1201) already route through it, so the override merges into the object
they each build and there is no fifth place to keep in step. `test-1354` counts the construction sites and
asserts every one goes through the helper — a site that built its own options would silently ignore the
override, which is 1266's defect in a new costume.

**It fails to the cloud, not to a broken room.** No host, a non-object, unparseable JSON — every one returns
`null`, which is exactly what someone who has configured nothing must keep getting. TLS is the default
(`secure !== false`): a broker is a websocket carrying room codes, so plaintext has to be asked for.

**The local copy carries NO integrity hash, deliberately.** The three CDNs keep build 1332's pin, because
that is where the risk is — SRI detects a mirror serving something other than what you asked for. A file you
host yourself is one you control, and pinning your own copy only means a legitimate update stops loading.
Same reasoning Rapier and fflate already shipped under; this build just makes it explicit at the site.

**The CSP had to learn about it or the block switch would kill exactly the people who ran their own
infrastructure.** Build 1335's parse-time injector reads the same `breach_peer` setting and appends
`https://<host> wss://<host>` to `connect-src` — both schemes, since signalling is HTTPS then a websocket
upgrade. The value goes into a **security policy**, so it is validated against `/^[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+$/` and
DROPPED rather than escaped if it carries a space, a quote or a semicolon.

Verified live (`tools/probe/peer-selfhost.mjs`):

```
unset          {"server":null,"host":null,"hasIce":true}
configured     {"host":"peer.example.org","port":9000,"path":"/rumpus","secure":true,"iceStillThere":true}
five kinds of rubbish  -> {"server":null}   (i.e. the cloud broker, unchanged)
clamps         {"hostLen":200,"port":65535,"secure":false}
loader         {"first":"peerjs.min.js","count":4,"localCarriesNoIntegrity":true}
               and it is actually served: {"ok":true,"bytes":92863}
```

The vendored file's sha384 is `nlUQ8Zq…`, **byte-identical to build 1332's pinned CDN hash** — so the copy
beside the game is provably the same PeerJS the CDNs were serving.

`tools/probe/mkprobe.mjs` now copies the vendored `.js` files into the probe directory, or every future
probe would boot without multiplayer. That edit went in **after** the `else` of the copy loop's guard, not
between the `if` and its `else` — build 1309's recorded trap, hit once and caught by reading it back.

**One pin moved (968), and it was the character-budget trap in its other costume.** It quoted `_peerOpts`'s
whole one-line return verbatim; the merge broke it with every part of the assertion still true. It asserts
the members now.

## Enemies can belong to a side (build 1355)

Every moving creature in this engine was hostile to the player and to nothing else. Build 1226 added the
pacifist NPC and recorded "friendlies fleeing gunfire" and enemies fighting each other as needing a
targeting rework. **It needed one line of one.**

`enemyDesiredTarget` has always been target-AGNOSTIC — it takes `px, pz, dist, py` — and the melee strike
calls `_tn.hurt(...)` on whatever object the picker chose. So the whole change is that the picker may choose
an **adapter around another enemy**, the way build 1189 reused the bot's cover finder through a `{pos}` shim.
The ranged path needed nothing at all: `fireEnemyShot(en, target)` already reads `target.pos` and
`target.eyeY`.

**The rule is `a !== b`, and the PLAYER is faction 0.** That gives an ally, the default hostile and two third
parties with no attitude matrix for a creator to author:

| | |
|---|---|
| **0 · Your side** | an ally: fights 1/2/3, never you |
| **1 · Hostile** | the default, and therefore what every level authored before this build already is |
| **2/3** | third and fourth parties — fight everyone but their own |

`friendly` (1226) stays **orthogonal**: a pacifist targets nothing and is targeted by nothing. Widening that
to "hostiles hunt villagers" would slaughter every existing level's NPCs on wave 1, so it is a stated limit
rather than a side effect.

### The fast path IS the compatibility argument

`_combatTargets()` is one list per frame, memoised on `_frameNo` so the picker and the bolt test cannot
disagree about who is shootable. **If no enemy carries a non-default faction it returns the player list and
the O(N²) enemy scan never runs** — measured live on a default-only level: target list length 1, and neither
grunt's `_near` is an enemy. Every level that never opens the new control pays nothing.

The adapter is cached **on the enemy**, so a 60-strong three-way fight allocates nothing per frame (1168).

### An ally with nothing to fight must not fall back to hunting you

`_noTgt` is set per frame when a combatant finds no valid target, and for that frame it behaves exactly like
1226's pacifist — patrols its post, raycasts no sightline, never becomes aware. Written as one named
predicate (`passive = en.friendly || en._noTgt`) read by both combat gates, rather than a second condition
beside each `en.friendly`. Measured: a lone ally never chases, never fires, and the player is untouched.

### Measured live (`tools/probe/factions*.mjs`), waves suppressed so every hp change is a fixture

```
two gunners, factions 0 and 1, 6 m apart   each picks the OTHER · 400 -> 264 / 400 -> 256 · player 100
two brutes,  factions 0 and 1, 2 m apart   400 -> 4 / 400 -> 4, through the real wind-up/strike path
a hostile's bolt at an ally                400 -> 396      at the player   100 -> 96
an ally's bolt at the player               100 (unchanged) — the bolt flew on
a LONE ally                                noTgt, never aware, never chasing, hostileAlive 0
2 allies + 1 hostile + 1 pacifist          _hostileAlive() 1
marker fac 2 -> desc 2 -> rebuilt 2 · default 1 · 99 -> 1 · -4 -> 1 · 'x' -> 1 · default keeps 0xfe4d5e
```

### Fail hostile, never ally — and the harness caught me failing the other way

`_facOf` originally read `v|0`, and **`undefined`, `null` and `NaN` all coerce to ZERO — "your side"**. Every
random-wave queue descriptor carries no `fac` at all, so `_hostilePending` subtracted every queued hostile as
if it were an ally and a wave read as already clear. The first draft compensated by substituting the default
at each *caller*, and `test-1226`'s accounting rig — which drives the real functions over plain
`spawnQueue` entries — found the caller that didn't. The rule now lives in `_facOf` where no caller can
forget it: `pending 0 → 3`.

Three more things fail in the safe direction on purpose: the default faction **serializes as nothing**, so a
level with no allies is byte-identical to pre-1355; the default marker **keeps the mode colour it always
had** (`FACTION_COL[1]` is deliberately 0), because an editor whose every marker changed colour on upgrade
reads as a bug; and the Faction control is **hidden for a pacifist**, which fights nobody.

### Rewards

`killEnemy` gained `_cred = !_fr && !byEnemy`. Killing your own ally is a death but never a reward (1226's
rule, restated for the other kind of non-combatant), and **an ally's kill is not your kill** — no count, no
lifesteal, no callout, no boss payday. The **loot still drops**: that is physical, and you have to walk to
it. Measured: a `byEnemy` kill gave `runKills +0, coins +2`; the same kill by the player gave `+1`.

### A probe note that cost three runs

An ally's bolt aimed at a hostile reported no damage, twice. Traced step by step: **both enemies were
standing on a platform at y ≈ 3 and `fireEnemyShot` spawns the bolt at a hardcoded y = 1.4** — inside the
geometry underneath them, so it died against a collider on its first step. Build 1323's lesson verbatim:
build the thing you are measuring somewhere nothing else lives. The mechanism was already proven four other
ways, so this was an instrument fault, not a null result.

Also worth knowing for the next probe of this system: **this sandbox renders ~1.5 fps** (20 frames in
13.2 s), so a bolt at 38 u/s moves ~25 units per frame and *tunnels straight through* a 1.1 m hit sphere. Any
projectile test at a real distance has to step `updateEnemyShots(1/120)` by hand rather than wait on frames.

Eighteen pins moved (283, 33, 374, 415, 47, 779, 1020, and eleven in 1226), every one keeping its intent —
1226's whole point, that a *friendly* pays nothing and holds no wave open, is asserted unchanged at each new
address. Two of them are executing rigs that needed the new dependency supplied: `test-1020` takes
`_combatTargets` as a pass-through of its player list (its assertions are about the bolt, not the list), and
`test-1226` lifts `_facOf`/`_enFac` from source rather than restating them.

## A match in progress stays findable (build 1356)

**Joining one has worked end to end for a long time.** The welcome carries `phase`, and a client that
connects mid-match runs `startGame()` directly instead of waiting in a lobby that is over; build 1197 forces
a keyframe whenever the connection count changes, so a late joiner never applies deltas against a baseline
it never saw; build 1201's rejoin path exercises all of it.

What did not work was **finding** one. `announceRoom`'s heartbeat returned unless `NET.phase === 'lobby'`,
and `startMatch` called `unannounceRoom()`. So the public directory only ever listed rooms where nobody was
playing yet — and for a game with a handful of concurrent players that reads as *"nobody is online"* at
exactly the moment somebody is. The most valuable rooms in the list were the ones the list deliberately hid.

`startMatch` now **re-announces** rather than deleting, with `live:1`. `unannounceRoom` is untouched and
still runs on all three ways OUT (leave, the leave button, `beforeunload`) — the test counts the call sites
so kickoff cannot quietly become a fourth again.

**No new privacy decision is being made here.** The room code was already published the moment the host
opened the lobby; continuing to publish it is the same exposure with strictly more utility, and the room's
own player cap is the gate — a full room refuses with `{t:'full'}` and always has.

### The cap is one derivation, or the list offers seats the door refuses

`_maxPlayersFor(mode)` now takes the mode, so the **browser** computes the same number the host's door
enforces, from a listing it has never connected to. Every existing call site passes nothing and reads the
live mode exactly as before. A full room is listed and **not clickable** — a dead click is the "nothing
happened" build 1147 removed — and the handler is only attached when there is a seat, rather than attached
and then refused.

### It works before the server is redeployed, which is why `max`/`live` are optional

`lobbies.php` whitelists the fields it stores, so a client sending new ones against the currently deployed
file has them silently dropped — and the room simply lists as an ordinary one, which **is** the whole fix.
The server half is written (both fields clamped like every other, both defaulting when absent so an older
client is unchanged) and adds the badge and the exact cap once uploaded. The browser derives the cap from
the mode meanwhile.

Verified live (`tools/probe/join-live.mjs`), every lobby PUT hooked and read back:

```
lobby     {live:0, players:3, max:8, mode:"coop"}      kickoff  {live:1, players:3, max:8}
duel      {max:2}                                       left     zero PUTs
list  COOP 3/8 Join · COOP 5/8 · in progress Join · COOP 8/8 FULL (disabled)
      against a lobbies.php that has NOT been updated:  DUEL 2/2 FULL · COOP 4/8 Join
```

That last row is the point of the derivation: the old-server entries carry no `max` at all and still land on
the right cap and the right button.

**Two pins moved, and one was deliberately INVERTED** — `test-110`'s *"match start de-lists the lobby"* was
asserting the defect. What it was really guarding, that a room nobody is in stops being advertised, is now
asserted where it actually happens. `test-956`'s quoted the whole heartbeat body literal and broke on two
added fields with every part of it still true; it asserts the members.

**Not verifiable headless, and stated as such:** a real two-machine mid-match join. The code path is pinned
at both ends (`phase:NET.phase` sent, `else { startGame(); }` received) and it predates this build; what
1356 changes is only whether the room is in the list.

## The mute survives the tab, and one name means one player (build 1357)

Build 1178 shipped `/mute` as per-session and by NAME, and named both costs: *"a renamed troll costs one
more /mute, which is acceptable for v1."* Neither is acceptable for a public release with minors. A mute
that dies with the tab is one you re-issue every session against the same person, and a mute keyed on a
string the muted party chooses is one they walk out of by retyping it.

**And nothing de-duplicated display names.** `rp.name = msg.n` took whatever arrived, so a harasser could
adopt their victim's name. That is not a cosmetic clash — it makes a chat log ambiguous, makes a build-1351
moderation report **unactionable** ("Griefer said X" — which one?), and makes muting the harasser mute the
victim. The two problems have one root, which is why they are one build: **the name was the whole
identity, and it was neither unique nor durable.**

### Three handles instead of one

- **The set PERSISTS** (`breach_mutes`), so muting someone is a decision rather than a session preference.
  Capped in both directions and validated on the way in, because it is stored data (1325's rule).
- **Muting a CONNECTED name also binds their player id for the session**, so renaming mid-match does not
  dodge it. The chat relay carries `from` now for exactly that — an OPTIONAL field, so an older host that
  does not send it leaves the check exactly as 1178 had it.
- **The host de-duplicates**, because only the host can see everyone. `_resolveName` is case- and
  whitespace-insensitive ("Griefer" and "griefer " are the same name to a person reading a log), counts
  **up** rather than randomising so a room that emptied hands your name straight back, and **skips its own
  id** — otherwise every re-send would walk a player up the numbers. The resolved name goes back as
  `{t:'yourname'}` so their own chat prefix, name sprite and report target read what everyone else sees.

`_cleanName` is one sanitizer: control and **zero-width** characters out (a zero-width space is how you
impersonate a name that only *looks* taken), whitespace collapsed, capped at 20. A display name reaches a
chat log, a name sprite, a kill feed and a moderation report, so an unbounded string is everyone else's
problem, not the sender's.

**A persistent list you cannot see is a list you cannot undo**, so `/mutes` prints it and `/unmute all`
clears it. Muting someone who is not in the room says so rather than claiming a binding it does not have.
Every command returns *before* the send — a `/mute` relayed to the room would tell the person you muted.

Verified live (`tools/probe/mute-names.mjs`) and executed in `test-1357`:

```
clean   "  Jarred  "->"Jarred" · ""->fallback · 60 chars->20 · zero-width stripped · "a   b"->"a b"
dedup   Griefer · Griefer (2) · griefer (3) · Jarred (2) [clashes with the HOST] · ""->Player5
        and the SAME player re-sending keeps Griefer
mute    stored ["griefer"], bound to pid 1 · 3 lines in -> 1 rendered
        the troll RENAMES to NotGriefer -> still 0 rendered
        a relay carrying no from-id falls back to name-only · the set survives a reload
```

**Still open, and named rather than implied:** there is no persistent identity in this engine, so a mute
cannot follow someone across sessions if they change their name between them. That needs accounts, which
the platform audit already lists. What this build buys is that the name is no longer the *only* handle.

**A backtick inside a template literal, for the third time.** The probe's own comment read ``// no `from` at
all`` inside a `P(\`…\`)` string and closed the template — a syntax error in the instrument, not the engine.
Recorded under builds 1328 and 1342; write it as plain prose in probe source.

## The shake curve was throwing away 85–96% of every gunshot (build 1358)

A six-critic AAA review panel ran against build 1357 (rendering, art direction, game feel, editor, performance,
audio+UI), each required to verify in source and measure rather than assert. This is the first fix out of it,
and it is one line.

```js
const s = shake * shake;          // ease — feels punchier
```

Trauma-squared is a real and standard curve — **for a trauma value that reaches 1.** Every call site in this
engine is far below that: gunfire lives at 0.045–0.16, where squaring only shrinks. Measured at the shipped
78° fov, driving the real block to convergence:

```
smg      addShake(0.045)   0.0020°   0.02 px @1080p    33 ms
rifle    addShake(0.080)   0.0080°   0.09 px           50 ms
shotgun  addShake(0.160)   0.0393°   0.46 px           83 ms
```

**A tenth of a pixel for two frames is not a camera shake, it is a rounding error** — which is why firing this
game read as clicking a mouse. The only thing that visibly moved the camera was a rocket at your feet.

Three faults in those six lines, all fixed together because they are one behaviour:

- **The curve is linear now**, and the gunfire call site was retuned with it (0.13 / 0.075 / 0.26). Leaving the
  amounts alone would have kept the frame nearly still. Rifle 0.30° over 118 ms, shotgun 0.60° over 236 ms, a
  rocket 2.06° over 818 ms. The damage-scaled hit amounts are deliberately **not** retuned — `dmg/55` was
  already in a usable range.
- **It was white noise resampled per frame.** The same shake was therefore a different visual phenomenon at
  30 Hz and at 144 Hz. `_shakeN(t, k)` is three sines at incommensurate rates summing to ±1, dominant ~24 Hz —
  a function of TIME, so what the player sees is refresh-rate independent by construction, and the three axes
  are near-uncorrelated so a shake is a shake rather than a diagonal line.
- **The decay was 2.2/s**, so a rifle's shake was gone inside two frames at 60 Hz. `SHAKE_DECAY = 1.1` gives it
  118 ms — still amplitude-proportional, which is right (a rocket shakes far longer than a shot), but long
  enough to be a motion rather than one displaced frame.

Build 1313's `a11y.shake` chokepoint, the clamp at 1, and build 1210's strafe lean as the base of the roll are
all untouched and pinned.

Two pins moved (1210, 91), both quoting the old literal with their intent intact: 1210's subject is that the
lean is the base of the roll in both branches, and 91's is that a shotgun kicks hardest and an SMG least —
both asserted directly now instead of by quotation.

## The library reported saves it never checked (build 1359 — editor review, the only CRITICAL)

Two silent data-loss paths in build 1262's level library, both found by reading the store calls:

**1. Nothing verified the write.** `_libPut` fired both stores and discarded both answers; `libSaveAs` and
`libCommit` never looked either, so the caller flashed `Saved as "Warehouse"` whether or not a byte landed.
The INDEX is a tiny localStorage write that succeeds when the multi-megabyte payload does not — which is
exactly what hid it: **the library LISTS a level that does not exist**, and Open, days later, says *"that
level could not be read"*. Executed against failing stores:

```
both stores work   -> "Saved as Warehouse" · index 1 · payload written
BOTH stores fail   -> "Saved as Warehouse" · index 1 · NOTHING WAS WRITTEN
```

**The author already knew to do this.** `saveLevel()` verifies its own write with a read-back and reports
*"Autosave failed — storage full"*. The library did not inherit it.

It stays **optimistic** on purpose — the callers are synchronous and the flow is unchanged. What the
verification buys is that a failed write **rolls its own index row back out** and says so. A row pointing at
nothing is worse than no row, because `libOpen` loads it over live work and only reports the read failure
afterwards.

**2. `_libCurrent` was module-level and never persisted.** So a reload — a crash, a restore, the next
morning — detached Save from the entry you had been working in, with no signal but a badge disappearing
from a row. Two hours of edits then went to the anonymous autosave slot while the named entry held
yesterday's level, and clicking Open loaded that *over* them. It is stored now, and `_libTrack` is the
**one writer** of both the variable and the key, so they cannot disagree. Build 1262's cross-tab guard
still holds and now clears the persisted id too.

Two pins moved (1262's rig needed the two new functions lifted from source rather than restated; 1322's
quoted `_libCurrent=id` and asserts the tracker now).

## The first frame is staged now (build 1360 — art-direction review)

Five numbers, and the process is the point: two of them measured **worse** on the first attempt and were
changed on the evidence rather than defended.

### The ground was the brightest thing in the picture

Authored hex, linearised to relative luminance:

```
_DL.pipe  0.0149 · _DL.wall 0.0365 · _DL.deck 0.0592     the level's own structure
floorColor 0.1040   <- the ENGINE ground plane,  +0.81 stops over the deck it surrounds
wallColor  0.1349   <- the BOUNDARY WALL,        +1.19 stops over the deck, and the coolest thing in shot
```

The two surfaces with the least to say were the **first and second brightest large albedos**, so nothing
popped off the floor and the frame's outer ring was its brightest region — with a 0.42 vignette fighting a
wall that had been authored bright. In almost every shipped AAA frame the ground is the darkest large value.

Both are scaled in **linear space**, which cannot change chromaticity — so the ground keeps the warm hue
build 1156 gave it, and `skyGround` moves by the same factor because 1156 tied them: the dome's ground band
and the engine's plane meet at the horizon, and darkening one alone puts back the seam that build removed.

**Build 1156 deliberately HELD this luminance and that decision is reversed here, explicitly.** 1156 was
fixing hue only and said so; the review's finding is that the value was the defect. Its pin now asserts the
RELATION (the plane is dark, the dome's band stays ~29% brighter) instead of the number.

### The sun was 117 degrees behind the player

`_sunDir()` at azim 63 / elev 34 is `(0.739, 0.559, 0.376)`; the spawn stands at `(0, 1.2, 30)` facing −Z,
so the horizontal sun-to-view dot was **−0.454**. That is why no capture in this repo ever had a rim light,
a long shadow toward camera, or the sun anywhere in frame.

**Textbook three-quarter back-light was tried first and measured worse.** Captured at the pinned top rung,
same pose:

```
                          clipped px   ground Y   ground sat   sky/ground
azim  63 / elev 34   before     0.05%     0.0853       0.314        7.18x
azim 150 / elev 24              5.04%     0.0617       0.212       12.87x   <- REJECTED
azim 105 / elev 24   shipped    0.03%     0.0486       0.254       15.26x
```

At 30° off dead ahead the sun disc and its glow sit inside a 110° horizontal fov, auto-exposure lifts the
whole frame to accommodate them, and clipping goes up a hundredfold. **The ELEVATION buys the shadows; the
azimuth only decides whether you are photographing the level or the sun.** At azim 105 the sun is 75° off
the view axis — out of frame, still low — so shadows rake ACROSS the picture at 2.25× the caster's height
(was 1.48×) and vertical edges rim.

### The bounce was re-derived, not left behind

Build 1149's term is `bounce × sun`, coloured by `sunColor × mix(floorColor, wallColor, 0.4)` — **the albedo
is already in the colour**, so halving the floor's luminance would have halved the delivered fill against a
frame that now has far more surface in shade. 0.50 → 0.85 leaves the darker ground bouncing less, as it
physically must, while keeping **77%** of the old delivered fill and with it 1149's margin against a crushed
red channel.

Generated arenas are untouched: `groundMood` overwrites `floorColor`/`wallColor` per theme, so this moves the
stock level and fresh levels only — which is exactly the content the review was looking at.

Four pins moved (1149, 1156, 1234, 855), each re-expressed as the relation it was really about.

## Airborne input can only add speed, and the mantle keeps momentum (build 1361 — feel review #4/#9)

Air control actively BRAKED the player (feel #4): the build-1171 airborne branch lerped velocity toward wish*sp — walk/sprint speed — so above that speed holding forward decelerated (critic: slide-jump 12.4 m/s held vs 14.8 released; my harness reproduces the defect at 15.19 held-old vs 17.19 released). Fixed with a Quake-derived projection in the airborne+input path only: when the speed ALONG the wish already meets the target, the parallel term is zero (never negative) and the perpendicular component keeps easing at MOVE_AIR_K (course correction still turns the arc). Below target the else branch is TEXTUALLY the old lerp, so walk-speed jumps, the grounded model, and AIR_BRAKE are bit-identical — proven by 120 frame-by-frame === comparisons in the test. Executed evidence: 21 m/s held forward keeps 21.00 exactly and lands faster than released (17.19); a 30 m/s blast keeps 30; diagonal steering after 0.5 s gives 8.72 u/s of new axis while the along-wish speed is invariant to 1e-6; 20 vs 144 Hz agree within 2% and a dt spike clamps without overshoot. The mantle (feel #9): the grab record now captures vx0/vz0 BEFORE the zeroing; pull COMPLETION restores hypot(vx0,vz0)×LEDGE_EXIT_KEEP (0.7, declared with the ledge constants — above every use) along the pull direction (gx,gz); the held-forward pull delay dropped 0.25→0.08 s. The per-frame zeroing during hang+pull is deliberately untouched (a hang is stationary), and a pre-1361 record ({}||0) degrades to the old 0 m/s exit, never NaN — executed. No pins moved: test-1171's lerp/rate pins survive as the else branch, test-1290/1289's grab-slice assertions (no forward.x/z, no _vh) are unaffected by the vx0/vz0 addition. Worktree had rolled back to build 1155 on start; recovered via git reset to origin branch head d5ceaab (build 1360) per the repo's rollback protocol before editing.

EVIDENCE:
All from the executed harness (154 checks) driving the REAL movement block sliced from breach.html via new Function, frame by frame. Slide-jump at 21 m/s, sp 14, 0.5 s at 120 Hz: held-forward NEW = 21.00 (exact — parallel term zero), released (AIR_BRAKE) = 17.19, held-forward OLD lerp = 15.19 — the old model braked a held jump BELOW the released arc, the new one preserves it fully. 30 m/s blast held forward keeps 30.00. Diagonal steering from (21,0): vel.z = 8.72 u/s of new axis after 0.5 s while the along-wish speed is invariant at 14.849 (min over all frames, 1e-6). Pure-perpendicular wish and all below-target airborne frames are === bit-identical to the old lerp across 120 frames; grounded accelerate+brake sequences === bit-identical. 20 Hz vs 144 Hz: 1 s of diagonal steering lands within 2% in speed and 0.04 rad in heading; a 0.5 s dt spike clamps (speed <= 21, along-wish exact). Mantle, executing the real pull-completion statement: arrival (12,9) with pull direction (0.6,0.8) exits at vel (6.3, 8.4) = |15|*0.7 along the pull; a pre-1361 record exits at exactly (0,0), never NaN; _mt=0.5 does not fire. Source pins: vx0/vz0 captured before the zeroing, per-frame hang zeroing intact, _wantUp at 0.08 with 0.25 absent.

RISKS:
1) The worktree had rolled back to build 1155 at session start; I recovered with git reset --hard d5ceaab (origin/claude/level-gen-themes-stairs-5slfr0 = build 1360). The orchestrator should confirm the landing tree really is 1360 before running the script — every anchor is a literal of that tree. 2) Steering while above target trades perpendicular speed for direction (total speed can fall toward the along-wish component); that is the intended projection semantics, but it is a feel change worth one browser pass: slide-jump then strafe mid-air. 3) The mantle exit restores velocity along the PULL direction (into the ledge top), not the arrival direction — deliberate (the player is now facing/moving onto the top), noted in case a report says the exit direction feels wrong. 4) The 0.08 s held-forward pull delay makes walking into a wall while holding W mantle almost immediately — if creators report accidental climbs, the delay is the lever, not the keep factor.
## Recoil recovers, kicks are per-weapon, and being hit punches the aim (build 1362 — feel review #2/#3/#14)

Recoil was a PERMANENT view displacement: the only kicks were player.pitch += 0.010..0.016 in shoot() and a hardcoded += 0.02 in fireRocketShot(), no site among the 26 player.pitch mutations ever subtracted them back (critic: one SMG magazine walked the view 23-31 deg, recoveredDeg 0), the only per-weapon factor was x2.4 for scope (SMG 14.3 deg/s vs shotgun 1.4 — backwards), yaw was never touched, and being hit produced no aim punch. Now: _recPitch/_recYaw camera-offset accumulators, declared beside the shake state, applied in the frame loop's first/third-person branch AFTER tpCameraPushback (the boom lookAt-overwrites rotation — applying before it would drop the kick in exactly the view where the old pitch kick was visible), sprung *= Math.exp(-8*dt) with an exact settle to 0, and the applied pitch clamped at 1.55 so base aim + offset never crosses vertical. player.pitch is never written (test counts exactly 1 remaining +=, the aim-assist one). Both kick sites route through one _recKick(w) whose first line is build 1102's fps gate, so cursor views stay un-kicked with no second copy of the rule. kickV/kickH joined build 1190's GUN_STAT_KEYS/GUN_STAT_LIM (serialization, clamps, loaders, editor rows for free), normalised into GUN_BASE per 1296's spurious-diff rule; table defaults shotgun 0.034 > pistol 0.018 > rifle 0.014 > smg 0.008, sniper 0.040, launcher 0.035, melee 0; ADS scales x0.6; kickH alternates sign with random lean. Aim punch (_recPunch) at both damage sites rides the already-computed hurt source (sx/sz, posEye, botById; unknown attacker jolts directionless), scaled dmg/maxHp, gated by a11y.shake. Mouse handler consumes live recoil before a downward pull reaches player.pitch (no double correction); up-pulls and yaw untouched. Ten pins moved keeping intent: 1102 (rocket gate now inside _recKick), 1190/1296 (GUN_BASE literal + key count 10→12), 103/138 (whole-literal weapon-line trap — pin members, not the closing brace), 95 (pvp hurtDir branch gained braces), 227 (scope x2.4 WAS the defect — now asserts sniper carries the heaviest kickV from the real table). NOTE: the worktree spawned on a stale build-1155 base; recovered via git reset --hard d5ceaab (build 1360 on claude/level-gen-themes-stairs-5slfr0) before any edit.

EVIDENCE:
Spring executed frame-by-frame through the REAL frame-loop block (sliced from source): a 0.03 rad kick recovers to 9.1% in 0.3 s at 60 Hz (was 0% recovery, forever), and 30/60/144 Hz land byte-identically on the analytic 0.03*e^(-8*0.5) over 0.5 s (1e-12); long run settles to exactly 0. Camera application verified: offset adds to rotation (0.2 -> 0.23 pitch, 1.0 -> 1.01 yaw — the old kick had NO yaw term), and base pitch 1.5 + full 0.22 kick clamps at 1.55 (never crosses vertical). _recKick executed: one shot pushes exactly kickV (0.03), cursor view ('top') pushes 0 (build 1102's gate), ADS scales to 0.018 (x0.6), a 200-round mag-dump clamps at REC_MAX 0.22 rad (~12.6 deg) versus the old 23-31 deg permanent walk. Per-weapon ordering from the real WEAPONS table: shotgun 0.034 > pistol 0.018 > rifle 0.014 > smg 0.008; sniper 0.040, launcher 0.035; crowbar/fists 0; every gun's kickH > 0 and < its kickV. Both damage sites executed through the real functions: PvE hit 30 dmg dead-ahead pushes p=0.0300 with zero side term, from the right yaws away (+), a11y.shake=0 gates to exactly 0; PvP hit via posEye pushes, unknown attacker (no posEye, botById null) still jolts directionless. Correction-subtraction executed on the real mouse-handler slice: a 0.02 rad down-pull against 0.05 live recoil moves the aim 0 and spends recoil to 0.03; a pull past the recoil passes only the remainder (0.29); up-pulls and yaw untouched. player.pitch += count engine-wide is exactly 1 (aim-assist).

RISKS:
1) The worktree spawned on a STALE base (build 1155, 896 harnesses — the documented rollback signature); I recovered with git reset --hard d5ceaab (build 1360, tip of claude/level-gen-themes-stairs-5slfr0). If the orchestrator's landing tree is also stale, check git log before applying. 2) Feel numbers (kickV/kickH defaults, REC_SPRING 8, punch magnitude 0.10*dmg/maxHp capped 0.06) are reasoned, not play-tested — a browser pass should confirm the shotgun/sniper kick reads heavy and sustained SMG fire holds a small lean; the levers are all in the WEAPONS table and the two constants. 3) In third person the offset is applied after tpCameraPushback (deliberate — the boom lookAt-overwrites rotation), so third-person recoil moves the CAMERA, not the avatar's aim; the old behavior moved both, since it corrupted player.pitch. 4) The accumulators freeze (no decay) while driving a car or manning a turret — those branches skip the apply block; residue is sub-degree and decays in ~0.3 s on exit. A turret's own shots never kick (turret fire doesn't route through shoot()'s kick site — same as before this build). 5) A pre-1362 saved level carrying a full st override for a weapon will have kickV/kickH absent from its st, so _wepApplyStats resets them to factory — correct (factory kick), but means old levels cannot have authored zero-recoil guns until re-saved, which is the intended default anyway.
## The SFX object finds its voice (build 1363 — audio review #3/#4/#7/#11)

The audio critics' cluster, all in the SFX region. (1) Every synth gunshot was bit-identical — playSample's pitch wobble covers only custom URL clips. SFX.shoot now jitters each tonal layer (freq ±3%, vol ±10%) and the tail delay ±15 ms per call, with a first-shot crack brightening (+20%) after a >400 ms gap, tracked by _shotSndAt. The table values are untouched; the jitter only multiplies them (zero-jitter control in the test reproduces 60/320 Hz and the 90 ms tail exactly). (2) pistol and launcher fell through _SHOT_LAYERS to the rifle patch — they get their own entries (700 Hz snappy mid-crack / 50 Hz thump with slower attack via a new optional subA + body.attack and a long lowpassed tail). (3) _spatialOut's curve was inverted vs physics ((1−d/55)², 1.3 dB from 1→5 m then a cliff, no spectral distance cue). Now g = REF/max(REF,d), REF=4 — measured g·d=REF exactly, 13.98 dB per 5× beyond REF — with the null-past-55 early-out kept byte-compatible (test-1208 passes untouched), plus ONE BiquadFilter lowpass (20 kHz→2.5 kHz exponential over 55 m, measured 2.7 kHz at 53 m) scaled down by behind-ness from −column2 of the same camera matrixWorld (fully-behind caps 3435 Hz and trims gain ×0.84 ≈ 1.5 dB). Every fallback preserved: no panner → sfxBus; no BiquadFilter → panner+gain only. NOTE: the brief's "14 dB from 1 to 5 m" is unattainable with its own REF=4 (full volume inside 4 m by design); the 1/d law delivers 14 dB per 5× beyond REF, which is what the test pins. (4) UI sound: uiMove/uiSelect/uiBack/uiOpen/uiClose/uiDeny + ONE delegated capture-phase click listener gated on _uiMenuCtx (pointer lock always wins — executed five ways), openModal/closeModal state-checked (defensive closes stay silent — executed), pause open/close voiced. (5) SFX.victory (rising major triad on MUSIC_ROOT, 1.19 s) and SFX.defeat (falling minor second 2^(−1/12), then 2 s sustain at 110 Hz), called beside BOTH gameWon stopMusic sites (campaign advance + final) and endGame's. (6) SFX.step rotates 420/520/640 with ±12%/±20% jitter, still flat (no at). Five pins moved (90, 1315, 1211×3, 976 — 976's pistol regex matched the new _SHOT_LAYERS entry first; re-anchored inside the WEAPONS table, intent unchanged). Worktree was cut at committed 1346 while the orchestrator's tree sat at 1360; synced breach.html/tests/server from the main tree and re-verified every anchor against its live 1362 state.

EVIDENCE:
Distance curve, executed through the real _spatialOut on a fake WebAudio graph: g(d)·d = 4 exactly beyond REF (g(10)·10 = 4.000000000), 20·log10(g(4)/g(20)) = 13.98 dB per 5× distance (old curve: 1.3 dB from 1→5 m), monotone across d = 1..53, null at 54.5 and 60 m (the 1208 contract — test-1208 passes UNTOUCHED). Behind-ness: at equal 10 m the lowpass reads 13,704 Hz ahead vs 2,398 Hz behind (ratio 0.175 exact), gain trim ratio 0.84 (≈1.5 dB); fully-behind point-blank caps at 3,435 Hz; 53 m reads 2,692 Hz. Fallbacks: no panner → sfxBus; no BiquadFilter → panner→gain→bus (no filter node). Shoot, zero-jitter control (Math.random=0.5): sub exactly 60 Hz, body 320 Hz, tail at exactly 90 ms, first-shot crack 0.216 (=0.18×1.2), follow-up 100 ms later 0.180, re-armed after 4.9 s → 0.216. Live jitter: consecutive body freqs differ, all samples inside ±3% freq / ±15 ms tail bounds. Step, zero-jitter: rotation 520,640,420,520,640,420 at vol 0.07; live: freq within [369.6, 716.8], vol within [0.056, 0.084], no `at`. Victory executed: 220→275→330 Hz (ratios 1.25/1.5 — major triad), span 1,190 ms; defeat: 220→207.66 Hz (2^(−1/12) to 1e-3), then 110 Hz for 2.0 s. gameWon carries exactly 2 SFX.victory() (both stopMusic sites), endGame exactly stopMusic(); SFX.defeat(). _uiMenuCtx executed five ways: pointer lock → false even with paused+overlay+modal all up; paused/overlay/modal each → true; in-world → false. openModal/closeModal executed 4 ways: sound only on a real state change. New test: 121 checks. Full suite 1100/1100 (baseline 1099 after build 1361's test landed mid-session, +1 mine).

RISKS:
1. The brief's two distance specs are mutually inconsistent: g = REF/max(REF,d) with REF=4 (implemented as named) cannot give 14 dB from 1→5 m, because it is full volume inside 4 m by design. The 1/d law delivers its 14 dB over any 5× span beyond REF (measured 13.98 dB, 4→20 m), which is what the test pins; near-field levels stay within ~3% of the old curve (old g(5)=0.826 vs new 0.8), so nothing close got quieter. If the orchestrator wanted rolloff active at 1 m, change REF to 1 — one literal plus two test expectations. 2. The worktree was cut at committed build 1346 while the orchestrator's live tree is at 1362 and moving; I developed against a synced copy and re-verified every breach.html and test anchor count==1 against the live 1362 tree, but if a build 1362+ edit lands inside the SFX region before 1363 is applied, re-grep the anchors. 3. Sounds need a browser ear: sting musicality, UI volumes (all ≤0.06), and that the delegated listener never fires in play (pointer-lock gate) are proven structurally/numerically, not audibly. 4. A modalClose click is deliberately excluded from uiSelect (closeModal's uiClose is the one voice for that event) — the brief listed .modalClose in the selector; it is in the selector and pinned, just routed to silence to avoid double-firing. 5. uiMove is defined but not yet wired (no hover/keyboard-nav sound was mandated); wiring it to menu keyboard navigation is a natural follow-up. 6. test-976's pistol pin was re-anchored because its bare first-occurrence regex now matches the new _SHOT_LAYERS.pistol — any OTHER future test written with a bare /pistol:|launcher:/ matcher has the same trap.
## AO survives the downshift (build 1364 — rendering review #3)

Rendering critic #3, verified at the lines: SSAO was the frame's entire contact darkening (measured at four wall feet: AO on = 13-15% darker at the foot, AO shed = 2-4% BRIGHTER), and `_aoWant = _geoWant && _ssaoAmt > 0.001 && _prStepI === 0` shed it on the FIRST downshift while bloom, god rays, fog and the grade survive deeper — with the median player on rung 1. The G-buffer prepass already survived to rung 2 (`_AO_GEO_MAXSTEP = 2`, build 1218) because soft particles and SSR read it, so the sample's input was there the whole time.

The gate is now `_aoWant = _geoWant && _ssaoAmt > 0.001` — AO lives wherever its G-buffer lives (rungs 0-2) and dies with it on rung 3. The `_ssaoAmt` term is load-bearing: `_geoWant` can be true from SSR alone, and an SSR-only level must not switch the AO sample on (executed in the test). The cost drop is a `uniform int uSamples` used as a dynamic break bound inside the existing compile-time-12 kernel loop (`if(i>=uSamples) break;` — legal in ES GLSL; only the loop header must be constant), set per frame inside the AO block as `_prStepI===0 ? 12 : _AO_TAPS_LITE` (6). A uniform write, never a recompile — the 636/977/1153 freeze class avoided by construction. Normalisation moved to `occ/float(uSamples)`: dividing by the compile-time 12 would silently halve AO strength at 6 taps; at 12 it is exactly the old divide, so rung 0 is byte-identical. The fixed kernel front-loads its near taps (w = 0.25+0.75·t², executed in the test), so the 6-tap mode keeps precisely the contact field the build exists to preserve; the existing bilateral blur absorbs the extra noise — no new knobs. `_ssrWant`, `_velWant` and `_SOFT_P` are untouched and pinned so.

Pins moved: test-1218 (its "prepass outlives the sample" became "the sample outlives rung 0" — rung 1/2 assertions inverted with the design, the `_aoWant` regex moved), test-1140 (the gate-pair regex; the below-MSAA intent now holds through the resolution-ladder term in `_geoWant`), test-1245 (its executed rung-1 case: SSR still sheds while AO now survives). test-1126 and test-1183 pass untouched.

EVIDENCE:
Gates executed from the REAL extracted `_geoWant`/`_aoWant`/`_ssrWant` source lines (test-1364, 25 checks): rung 0 → geo/ao/ssr all true; rung 1 → geo TRUE, ao TRUE, ssr FALSE (AO now survives the median player's rung while SSR still sheds); rung 2 → geo/ao true, ssr false; rung 3 → all false (AO dies with its G-buffer). SSR-only level (ssao=0, ssr=0.35) on rung 1 → geo true, ao FALSE, proving the retained `_ssaoAmt` term. Tap-count ternary executed from source: pick(0)=12, pick(1)=6, pick(2)=6, with the write proven inside the `_aoWant` block before the kernel render. Shader pins: compile-time loop bound unchanged at 12, `if(i>=uSamples) break;` first in the loop body, `uSamples:{value:12}` default, `occ/float(uSamples)` normaliser with `occ/12.0` absent (rung 0 therefore byte-identical). Kernel IIFE executed: first-6 mean radius < last-6 mean radius, so the 6-tap mode keeps the near/contact field. Moved tests pass: 1218 (14), 1140 (52), 1245 (29); untouched 1126 (72) and 1183 (23) pass unmodified. Boot test passes (no TDZ: `_AO_TAPS_LITE` is module-level, read only from the frame loop).

RISKS:
MAJOR: the worktree was at build 1346, not the stated 1360 — `grep -c "build 1360"` returned 0, BUILD_VERSION reads 'build 1346', and NO fetchable remote (origin, origin-fresh, any branch) holds anything newer; CLAUDE.md's own entries for 1347-1353 are absent from this tree. This is the repo's documented container-rollback signature. All anchors are exact literals of the 1346 tree; every one is unique (counts asserted by the script), and none of them sit in code the 1347-1360 build notes describe touching (1350's ladder change touched `_applyPixelRatio`/`SUN_SHADOW_PX`, not the AO gates; 1353 touched `_aoHideNoDepth` CALL SITES' arrays, not the gate lines) — but re-run the script's anchor asserts on the real 1360 tree before landing; it aborts atomically on any mismatch. Sibling worktrees (presumably builds 1361-1363) may also touch `_renderPostFX`; land in number order and re-verify. Suite baseline here is 1084→1085, not 1098→1099, for the same reason. Behavioural: rungs 1-2 now pay the AO kernel+blur (half-res, 6 taps + 7-tap separable blur) that they previously skipped — a small added load on machines already downshifting; the kernel cost halves via the break but the two blur passes run at full former cost. Visual noise at 6 taps is absorbed by the existing bilateral blur per the finding's instruction (no new knobs); a browser pass on a rung-1 machine is the only way to eyeball it. GLSL: the data-dependent `break` inside a constant-bound loop is the standard WebGL1-safe pattern, but SwiftShader/ANGLE compile was not exercised headless.
## The health bar carries hp in its colour, and the interface moves (build 1365 — UI review #12/#13)

Build 1365 (audio/UI critic #12+#13). The health bar was permanently the alarm colour — #hpFill was a static linear-gradient(90deg,#ff4d6d,#ff8a5b) and updateHUD only ever wrote its WIDTH, so a full bar at 100 HP read as danger; and nothing in the interface moved (4 keyframes, all idle loops, zero cubic-bezier). Now: (1) _hpBarColor(frac) lerps three stops — healthy = the accent 56,245,181, caution #ffd166 at 50%, danger #ff4d6d at/below 25% — into the same two-tone gradient shape (second stop lightened 28% toward white); _hpBarTick paints it inline from updateHUD off the exact hp/maxHp fraction the width uses, quantized to 64 buckets with a latch so the CSS string is rebuilt only when the bucket moves. Under 25% the hpPulse class pulses opacity — deliberately OUTSIDE the reduced-motion guard because it is information, not decoration. A creator-authored hudCfg.health (builds 665/967) still WINS: the dynamic paint only drives the factory colour; on a custom colour the inline style is cleared so the #hud #hpFill var(--hud-health) rule shows, and applyHudCfg both resets the latch and clears the paint immediately (the HUD editor previews without an updateHUD). The latch is a VAR, not let — applyHudCfg's module-level boot call runs long before the declaration line, the recorded TDZ trap. (2) :root gains --ease-out cubic-bezier(.16,1,.3,1) and --ease-in cubic-bezier(.7,0,.84,0); one panelIn keyframe (opacity 0→1, translateY 8px→0, scale .98→1, 180ms var(--ease-out)) on .modalCard, #pauseMenu .pauseCard, .uiDlgCard and #killFeed .kfRow (rows are created with that class, so insertion IS the wiring); #shop gets its own panelInCentered keyframe because its base transform is translate(-50%,-50%) — the shared keyframe would clobber the centring mid-animation. All entry animations sit inside @media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference). Zero pins moved; test-814's accent-hex line sweep required keeping the raw #38f5b5 literal out of my comments (rgb triples in code), which preserves that pin at full strength. CRITICAL: this worktree was at build 1346, not the stated 1360 — builds 1347–1360 are unreachable on every remote (rollback signature); all anchors are exact literals of the 1346 tree, baseline suite 1084.

EVIDENCE:
Executed on the real extracted functions (tests/test-1365-health-colour-motion.mjs, 46 checks): _hpBarColor(1) = rgb(56,245,181) — the accent, provably not danger; (0.5) = rgb(255,209,102) exactly; (0.25), (0.1), (0) = rgb(255,77,109) exactly; (0.75) lands on the caution/healthy midpoint per channel to ±1; crossing either stop by ±0.01 moves every channel ≤12 code values (no hue snap — measured max was 6 on green at the 0.5 stop); green rises monotonically 0.30→0.45. _hpBarTick executed against a counting style stub: paints accent at 1.0, danger + hpPulse at 0.12, pulse removed at 0.8; tick(0.8) → tick(0.8001) performs ZERO additional style writes (same 64-bucket), a moved bucket repaints; with hudCfg.health='#123456' the inline background is '' at every hp (the authored var(--hud-health) rule wins) while the low-hp pulse still fires. CSS proven by brace-walking the @media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference) block: panelIn and panelInCentered declared exactly once, inside it; the 180ms var(--ease-out) rule covers .modalCard, #pauseMenu .pauseCard, #killFeed .kfRow; #shop uses the translate(-50%,-50%)-composed variant. Boot test executes the source clean (the var latch survives applyHudCfg's module-level boot call). Suite: 1084/1084 baseline → 1085/1085 after, zero pins moved.

RISKS:
1) TREE MISMATCH — this worktree (and every reachable remote: origin, origin-fresh) tops out at build 1346 (commit 85e88b8), not the stated build 1360; builds 1347–1360 are unreachable, which matches the repo's documented container-rollback signature. All anchors are exact literals of the 1346 tree and the baseline was 1084 harnesses (not 1098). If the orchestrator's landing tree really is 1360, some anchor may mismatch — the script aborts atomically (writes nothing) in that case; the anchors chosen (the :root line, #hpFill rule, kfArrow rule, updateHUD header, the width line, the --hud-health set) are all old, stable code, so they will most likely land unchanged. 2) The dynamic colour is an inline style and therefore outranks the #hud #hpFill var(--hud-health) rule; that is guarded by the custom-colour yield (skip + clear when hudCfg.health differs from DEFAULT_HUD.health) and by the applyHudCfg hook clearing the paint on theme change — a creator picking EXACTLY the factory #ff4d6d as a custom colour gets the dynamic bar, which is indistinguishable from factory and documented in the comment. 3) hpPulse is deliberately OUTSIDE the reduced-motion guard (it is low-HP information; a 0.9 s opacity swell, not a flash) — if a player report reads it as motion, wrap it or route it through build 1313's flash slider. 4) The 180 ms entry animation replays on every .hidden toggle (pause menu on every Escape); feel needs one browser eyeball — the harness cannot judge it.
## Zeroed lights skip the BRDF (build 1366 — performance review #1)

The light budget dims lights that still cost a full BRDF — zero of the fade was saved. updateLightBudget fades far emitters to intensity 0 (13 of the stock level's 29 point lights), and r149's lights_fragment_begin calls RE_Direct UNGUARDED for every point and spot light, so all 29 ran BRDF_GGX per fragment. Verified against the real vendored r149 first (per instruction, not the critic's word): getPointLightInfo and getSpotLightInfo both set `light.visible = ( light.color != vec3( 0.0 ) )` — false for a zeroed intensity or a fragment past the distance cutoff — and it was only ever read on the shadow ternaries; getDirectionalLightInfo sets it unconditionally true, so only point/spot need guarding, and the directional loop is deliberately untouched (build 1185's cascade pick blackens directLight.color there on purpose — a guard would do nothing or break the cascades). Build 1366 patches THREE.ShaderChunk.lights_fragment_begin once at boot: `_lgbGuardVisible` finds each info call and wraps the NEXT RE_Direct in `if ( directLight.visible ) { ... }` on ONE line, so three's lazy unrollLoopPattern still ends on the loop's own closing brace — proven in test-1366 by lifting the real pattern from WebGLProgram.js and unrolling the patched text (a broken unroll silently kills every lit material). The apply is gated `typeof === 'string'` (boot harness stubs THREE), installs only on exactly 2 landings, else warns loudly and leaves the chunk untouched (1181/1183's rule); it is idempotent (a re-apply is byte-identical) and sits before the 1181 fog ShaderLib walk, ahead of every program compile; 1185's edit composes on top (simulated end-to-end in Node). Braces inside the JS strings are {/} escapes — extractFunction's brace-matcher trap. updateLightBudget, castShadow, .visible and the light count are untouched and pinned. Zero stale pins broke. Note: the worktree arrived rolled back to build 1346; recovered with git reset --hard d5ceaab (build 1360) per the documented protocol before any edit.

EVIDENCE:
Verified in the real vendored r149 (tests/node_modules/three): lights_pars_begin computes `light.visible = ( light.color != vec3( 0.0 ) )` in exactly the point and spot info functions (2 occurrences), spot's off-cone branch sets `light.visible = false`, directional sets it unconditionally `true`; lights_fragment_begin has exactly 3 `RE_Direct( directLight, geometry, material, reflectedLight );` calls and zero pre-existing visible guards. Engine patch executed against the real chunk text: landed 2/2, exactly two `if ( directLight.visible ) { RE_Direct(...); }` guards (first between the point and spot info calls, second between spot and directional), directional call still bare, brace counts +2/+2 balanced. Idempotence: re-applying returns byte-identical text with n=2; a needle-free input returns untouched with n=0. Unroll safety proven against the REAL WebGLProgram unrollLoopPattern lifted from source: patched chunk substituted for a 2-point/1-spot/1-dir scene fully unrolls (no `unroll_loop_start` remains), yielding 3 unrolled guards and `pointLights[ 1 ]`. Boot composition simulated end-to-end in Node: patch lands 2/2, then build 1185's cascade replace still lands on the guarded text with both guards intact. Order pinned: apply call precedes the 1181 fog ShaderLib walk; single call site (2 total references). updateLightBudget fade pins hold (base intensity restore, FADE=5, `1 - over/FADE`, `.baseIntensity * f`); the patch block contains no `.castShadow` or `.visible =` writes. test-01-syntax PASS, test-202-boot PASS (typeof gate keeps the stub-THREE boot silent), new test PASS (35 checks), suite 1099/1099 (baseline was 1098/1098).

RISKS:
1) The worktree arrived rolled back to build 1346 (the documented container-rollback signature); I recovered with `git reset --hard d5ceaab` to build 1360 before editing. The orchestrator should confirm the landing tree is at the expected build before applying — the script's anchors (`THREE.UniformsLib.fog.fogHeightP = { value:_fogParamsU };` followed by the `// ...but ShaderLib MERGED` comment) are from the 1360 tree; builds 1361-1365 are unlikely to touch that boot region (1361/1362 are movement/recoil builds) but the rep() count asserts will abort atomically if they do. 2) The visual effect (zeroed lights contributing nothing) is unchanged by construction — a black colour times a BRDF was already zero — but the frame-time win is only measurable in a browser; a GPU-time before/after on a light-heavy level belongs on the human-verify list. 3) If a future three upgrade rewords the RE_Direct or info-call text, the patch warns loudly and leaves the chunk untouched (lights keep shading as before — the pre-1366 behaviour, never a broken frame), and test-1366 fails on the stock-needle premises.
## The capsule enemy telegraphs its wind-up (build 1367 — feel review #5)

The stock capsule enemy had ZERO visual telegraph (feel critic #5). Both wind-ups exist and are well timed — ENEMY_MELEE_WINDUP_MS = 320 and the charger's ~520 ms _lungeWind — but their only consumer was the anim state machine, gated on hasModel && stateActions, which the engine's own procedural capsule has neither of. So on the default path (every random wave, the stock level) an enemy stood still for a third of a second and you lost 9 HP, with only build 1283's audio as the tell.

Now the capsule pulses its emissive and squashes in anticipation, capsule-only (build 1226's gate shape: no hasModel, no stateActions — a custom model's attack clip IS its telegraph, and two systems on one body is 1145's double grain). _telegraphPulse(t) ramps 0.6→2.2 with a cosine whose phase is t·t·TELE_CYC·2π, so the pulse rate is 2·TELE_CYC·t — it QUICKENS toward the strike, the build-1315 sapper-fuse pattern — with a rising ramp floor so the level climbs the whole window and lands exactly at 2.2 at the strike (integer TELE_CYC parks the cosine at its trough there). Ceiling 2.2 sits deliberately under flashEnemy's 2.4 so a landed hit still reads brighter; a live hit flash outranks the pulse, and the telegraph seeds _emi0 so a mid-pulse flashEnemy capture can never record a pulsed value as the base. Squash: scale.y ×0.92, x/z ×1.04 of the AUTHORED scale (stashed once as a number — zero per-frame allocation, 1168), eased in over the first quarter. Restore is keyed off the STATE (_windupT/_lungePending), never a timer, so build 1209's heavy-hit interrupt, a whiff and a landed strike all restore byte-exactly; killEnemy also restores before the ragdoll/topple, because the splice means the tick never runs again. Verified per the finding: useCapsule constructs the material PER CAPSULE (new MeshStandardMaterial per body — flashEnemy already animates exactly it), so no clone was needed; the test pins that fact rather than assuming it. Constants + functions sit beside flashEnemy, above the frame-loop call site (1315's TDZ lesson). Zero pins moved.

Note: the worktree spawned stale at build 1346 (rollback signature); recovered with git reset --hard origin/main (build 1362, acdb295) before any edit — anchors are literals of that tree.

EVIDENCE:
All from the executed harness (51 checks) driving the real extracted _telegraphPulse/_telegraphFrac/_telegraphTick/_telegraphEnd with the real extracted constants (TELE_EMI_LO 0.6, HI 2.2, CYC 3, SQ_Y 0.08, SQ_XZ 0.04, ENEMY_MELEE_WINDUP_MS 320). Pulse: pulse(0) === 0.6 exactly, pulse(1) = 2.2 within 1e-9 (integer-cycle trough property), never below the rising ramp floor LO+(HI-LO)·t and never above HI across 401 samples; full-height peaks detected at t = [0.408, 0.707, 0.913] — exactly CYC of them — with successive gaps 0.299 → 0.206 shrinking, i.e. the tell ACCELERATES toward the strike (rate 2·CYC·t by construction). Tick on a 1.35-scale capsule: mid wind-up scale.y = 1.35·0.92 and x/z = 1.35·1.04 to 1e-12 (volume 0.995 ≈ 1), emissive pulsing inside [0.6, 2.2]; strike (game zeroes _windupT) → x/y/z === 1.35 byte-exact and emissive === 0.6, and a further idle tick performs ZERO scale writes. 1209 interrupt (zeroed timer mid-window) restores byte-exactly on the very next frame. Charger path: _lungePending + _lungeWind squashes identically, dash consuming _lungePending restores exactly; authored lungeWind 700 honoured. Gates: hasModel, stateActions and dead each produce zero scale writes, zero emissive writes, no latch. flashEnemy interplay: with _flash live the material stays at 2.4 (hit outranks tell) while the squash applies, and _teleEmi0 records the true 0.6 base, never 2.4. Shape pins: tick wired beside _sapperFuse in the per-enemy loop; killEnemy restore before spawnCorpse; the model anim gate line intact; no new/clone/object-literal/closure in any of the four functions (1168); useCapsule constructs the material per capsule (verified in extracted buildEnemyVisual — it was never shared, so no clone was needed); TELE_* constants above the call site and ENEMY_MELEE_WINDUP_MS (line 25035) above the resolver (1315 TDZ rule). Suite: syntax PASS, boot PASS, 1101/1101 (base tree was 1100/1100 at build 1362; zero existing pins broke).

RISKS:
1) The worktree spawned STALE at build 1346 (grep -c "build 1360" read 0 — the documented rollback signature); I recovered with git fetch + git reset --hard origin/main, landing on build 1362 (acdb295). Every anchor is a literal of THAT tree — if the orchestrator's landing tree differs (builds 1363-1366 landing first), the three rep() anchors are all in code those builds are unlikely to touch (flashEnemy body, the _sapperFuse call line, killEnemy's "let _rdx, _rdz;"), and the script aborts atomically on any mismatch. 2) The telegraph is host-side only: co-op clients render enemy mirrors that never run this tick, so a joiner does not see the pulse — same locality as build 1283's audio tell, noted rather than fixed. 3) A sapper that both winds up and detonates leaves via detonateExploder (no restore call there) — its mesh is removed/exploded immediately so a residual squash cannot show; only killEnemy hands a corpse to ragdoll/topple, and that path restores. 4) Tuning (2.2 ceiling, 3 cycles, 8%/4% squash) is reasoned, not play-tested — a browser pass should confirm the tell reads at combat distance and the squash does not look like a hit reaction; the levers are the five TELE_* constants in one place. 5) The squash animates the capsule visual's scale, which nothing else writes during life (verified: useCapsule setScalar once; death paths restore first) — if a future build animates capsule scale (e.g. a spawn pop), _teleSc capture at telegraph start would stash the mid-animation value; the state-keyed restore still returns exactly what it captured.
## Framing covers the whole selection, and the Transform fold edits all of it (build 1368 — editor review #2/#3)

Two halves of one editor defect: the multi-selection machinery existed (build 564) and both "act on the selection" surfaces beside it ignored it. (1) `_edFrameSelected` resolved through `selectedSceneObject()` — the PRIMARY — so the asset browser's select-every-copy, Level Check's go-to, and the F key all framed one member: executed in the harness, three 2×2×2 props at x 0/60/120 framed the camera 3.42 m from the first and ~120 m from the last. It now unions the members' Box3s (`_frmOne` scratch beside `_frmBox`, gated on `isGroupSel()` and NOT `selPickup>=0` — a pickup selection can sit beside stale selProps) with the light-marker substitution applied PER MEMBER, and derives the distance from the union radius; the single-selection path is the pre-1368 code verbatim, so test-1137's pins and executable rig pass untouched. (2) The Transform fold's field commit wrote `tgt.state[fld.k]` then `tgt.apply()` — primary only — while the gizmo next to it runs `applyGroupDrag`. `_xfGroupApply(k, oldV, newV, uniform)` now applies the gizmo's own group semantics: position/rotation as the DELTA the primary moved (rotation fields are degrees → members get delta·RAD), scale as the RATIO (refusing |old| ≤ 1e-6, non-finite, or ≤ 0 ratios), proportional-ON spreading the ratio to all member axes like the uniform handle, each member getting the drag's own bookkeeping (retileProcSurface + refreshPropCollider + _homeSync). The commit captures `_xfOld` BEFORE mutation and calls the group apply gated `tgt===editorTargets.props`, so lights/zones stay single-target exactly. No snapshot inside the apply — the existing mousedown/focus gesture snapshots (1163) already capture every member. Build 1299's `_selBanner` now announces the fold group-wide for props (call-site count 5 → 6). Two pins moved, intents kept: test-1299 and test-1305 both counted `_selBanner(` at 5 and now assert 6, with the new fold named in the message.

EVIDENCE:
All executed in tests/test-1368-frame-union-transform-group.mjs (53 checks) against the REAL extracted functions. Framing, three 2×2×2 props at x 0/60/120: single-selection reproduces today's numbers exactly — camera 3.42 m from the primary's centre with the far member ~120 m away (the defect); with all three selected the camera's forward points at the union centre (60,1,0) on all three axes to 1e-6 and lands 120.6 m out (union radius 61.03 / tan(fov/2) × 1.6), covering the 120 m spread, with every member inside the framed volume. A selected pickup (selPickup=2) beside a live group frames the pickup's object at the single-selection 3.42 m; a null hole and a NaN-box member are skipped without failing the frame. Group apply: primary px 0→4 moves members 10→14 and 25→29 with their 15 m offset preserved and the primary untouched (tgt.apply owns it); ry 0→90 turns members exactly π/2; sx ratio 2 takes a scale-2 member to 4 and a scale-1 member to 2 (ratio, not absolute); ratios against 0, 1e-9 and −2 all refuse with nothing moved; proportional-ON spreads ratio 2 to all member axes; editorActive='lights', a 1-member selection, and editor-closed all refuse. Each moved member got exactly one refreshPropCollider + retileProcSurface + _homeSync (counted: 2 each for 2 members). _xfGroupApply contains no pushUndoSnapshot; both gesture-snapshot lines pinned intact. _selBanner call count 5→6 asserted in three tests. test-1137's full executable framing rig passes untouched (single path byte-identical).

RISKS:
1) The worktree base was build 1362, not the briefed 1360 (the orchestrator had landed 1363-era builds under a 1362 stamp? — BUILD_VERSION reads 'build 1362'); every anchor is an exact literal of THAT tree, and rep() aborts atomically on any drift, so a mismatch at landing fails loudly rather than mixing. 2) The finding's "banner count 4 -> 5" was stale — the tree (and tests 1299/1305) already counted 5 matches of `_selBanner(` (definition + 4 sites); this build moves both pins 5 → 6. 3) Slider drags fire the group apply per input event with chained incremental deltas — correct arithmetic, but a 200-prop selection pays N× refreshPropCollider per slider tick; the gizmo drag already pays the same, so no new class of cost, worth knowing if a huge-selection drag feels heavy. 4) The union framing is gated on isGroupSel() (editorOpen + active list >1) and skips when a pickup is selected; if some future flow calls _edFrameSelected with editor closed and a multi-selection, it frames the primary — same as before this build. 5) A browser pass should eyeball once: select three spread props, press F (whole set in frame), and type into Pos X with three selected (all three slide, banner visible above the fields).
## Procedural clouds in the sky dome (build 1369 — rendering review #6 + art review #1)

## The sky finally has weather in it (build 1369 — rendering #6 + art #1)

Verified first: the sky path had no cloud term of any kind — an open-sky patch varied only by the film grain over the three-band gradient, and the first frame is over a third empty sky. A 2-octave value-noise FBM now composites over the gradient in the DOME shader: coverage `worldCfg.skyCloud` (0..1, default 0.35), formation size `worldCfg.skyCloudScale` (0.25..4), edge softness DERIVED from the existing Haze (no third knob), lit warm on the sun side, drifting on a bounded clock.

**One rule decided every wiring question: clouds are in the PICTURE, not in the light.** The dome composites the layer before its shared tone-map/encode (test-1127's pin moved with the main line, intent kept); the hemisphere fill, the fog ring and the environment probe all stay cloudless, documented at each site — they recompute on the day-cycle cadence (or a rate-limited probe key that knows no clock) while the layer drifts per frame, and lighting that breathes out of step with the visible sky would be a worse artifact than the omission. The probe keeps build 1136's RAW RADIANCE line byte-identical, so the three tests pinning it pass untouched.

Four decisions that are each a bug the other way:
- **The hash is SIN-FREE** (Hoskins-style fract chains) — fract-sin precision decays with the drift offset, which is exactly the finding's warning — and the clock still wraps at 2048 s so the noise domain stays small on mediump GPUs (one re-seed per ~34 min, accepted).
- **Coverage 0 is an explicit first-line early return**, byte-identical to the pre-cloud sky, executed through a JS mirror of the pinned GLSL lines (the mirror returns the input object itself).
- **The cloud colour is built from uHor/uZen only, no additive constant** — executed: scaling the sky colours ×0.1 scales the clouds ×0.1 exactly, so a Night sky keeps dark clouds instead of glowing.
- **`_skyP` is the single reader and therefore the clamp point** — hostile/NaN coverage cannot reach a uniform through any loader; zero survives the `!= null` gate. The fields ride the probe key via P automatically.

Wired: SKY_DEF, DEFAULT_WORLD, two sliders beside Haze, and per-mood coverage (Day = the default per 1234's rule, test-enforced; Overcast 0.92 is near-full cover). One pin moved (1127). Executed: an opaque cloud dims the real skyRadiance sun disc below 30% — the sun can finally go behind a cloud. Not capture-verified: what the formations look like needs a browser eyeball at Day/Overcast/Night.

EVIDENCE:
All from the executed suite on the verified base (baseline 1106/1106 at commit 5012844, "probe: shot-arena passed removeProp"). New test tests/test-1369-procedural-clouds.mjs: 65 checks. GLSL pinned line for line (four uniforms, the sin-free Hoskins-style hash sliced and proven to contain no sin(, the exact 2-octave FBM, the coverage smoothstep, the drift/uv line, the cloud-colour line, and the first-line early return adjacent to the applyClouds header). Dome main executed via extractFunction: composite-then-tonemap-then-encode ordering pinned as _out(_aces(applyClouds(skyRadiance(nd), nd))); the drift clock write pinned with its % 2048 wrap. Probe: build 1136's raw-radiance main line is BYTE-IDENTICAL (test-1115, test-1144 and test-1127's own probe block all pass untouched), plus new pins that _skyEnv never references the cloud layer. applySky: hemisphere average and fog ring still call skyRadiance verbatim, no cloud reference, decision comment pinned. Clamps executed through the real _skyClamp + _skyP: unset→0.35/1, 99→1, −5→0, 'x'(NaN)→0.35, 0→0 (the != null gate), scale 0.01→0.25 and 99→4. JS mirror of the pinned GLSL executed: coverage 0 returns the INPUT ARRAY ITSELF for all 72 test directions (reference identity — the byte-identical property, executed not asserted); below-horizon identity; FBM bounded [0,1] and non-flat over 500 samples with the 0.65 threshold selecting a real minority; mean mask monotone 0.15 < 0.5 < 0.92 coverage with overcast > 0.55; drift at t=700 moves the mask; cloud colour scales LINEARLY (×0.1 sky → ×0.1 cloud to 1e-12 — no night glow); sun-side R gain > B gain (warm); and an opaque cloud at full coverage dims the REAL skyRadiance sun disc below 30% of its bare luminance. Wiring: SKY_DEF/DEFAULT_WORLD literals, the two sliders after Haze, SKY_MOODS parsed and executed (all five in range, Day === DEFAULT_WORLD per the 1234 rule, Overcast max ≥ 0.85, Night min), legacy flat-sky levels proven to keep skyMode 'flat' so the layer cannot reach pre-sky content. One pin moved: test-1127's dome-main line (intent kept — tone map then encode, now with the composite named). Neighbour tests re-run individually: 1127 (61), 1119 (98), 1234 (39) all pass. Syntax PASS, boot PASS, full suite 1107/1107.

RISKS:
1) The default coverage 0.35 is per the finding, which means EVERY existing procedural-sky level gains clouds on upgrade (legacy pre-1119 levels are safe — they render the flat background, executed in the test). If a creator report objects, the lever is one number in SKY_DEF/DEFAULT_WORLD, and coverage 0 is proven byte-identical. 2) What the formations LOOK like is not capture-verifiable here — the shape/brightness constants (1.35 base frequency, 0.9 max opacity, the 1.12/0.30 colour weights, 0.004 drift) are reasoned and property-tested, not eyeballed; a browser pass should check Day, Overcast and Night, plus the horizon fade band at low sun. 3) The GLSL compiles structurally (raw ShaderMaterial — the silent-vanish class): every literal has a decimal point, smoothstep's edge width is floored at 0.06 so edge0 can never equal edge1, and both early returns are plain statements, but no SwiftShader compile was exercised headless; a black sky in the browser would mean a compile fault and the first check is the console. 4) Reflections and the hemisphere/fog lighting deliberately stay cloudless (documented at all three sites) — an Overcast level's water and chrome will mirror a clean gradient; if that ever reads wrong, the probe main is the one line to change, at the cost of the three raw-radiance pins and frozen-drift reflections. 5) The drift clock wraps at 2048 s, so a session sees one instantaneous cloud re-seed per ~34 minutes — accepted for a bounded noise domain on mediump GPUs, noted at the site. 6) uCloudSharp inherits skyTurb unclamped (a NaN turbidity already breaks uFall today — pre-existing exposure, not widened).
## The bake ships ON, and the probe follows the player (build 1370 — rendering review #1)

93% of the light in a sealed room arrives through the walls (1345), and the ONE occlusion-aware indirect term — the per-vertex sky-visibility bake (1195, indirect-only since 1286) — shipped OFF, while the env probe was captured at the SPAWN only, so reflections and the image-based ambient were wrong everywhere else. Two halves.

1. DEFAULT_WORLD.baked:true. The legacy story is a DECISION documented at _worldFrom: a level with no baked key INHERITS true — since 1286 the bake is indirect-only crease darkening that never touches the direct sun, so this is the 1149 precedent (a correction applying only where the old term was wrong is not gated on authorship), not a colorV-class re-grade. The inheriting population is BOUNDED: applyWorldCfg forces worldCfg.baked to a boolean and serializeLevel writes worldCfg whole, so every level saved since 1195 carries an explicit baked — false included — and keeps its look byte-exactly. Only pre-1195 levels inherit.

2. buildSceneProbe(px,py,pz): an explicit position wins; with none, a re-shoot refreshes IN PLACE at _spPos (the recorded capture point) — the day-cycle rebuild must not snap a followed probe back to spawn, or a moving player under a day cycle would thrash two capture points at six scene renders + a PMREM each; only a fresh deploy (requestSceneProbe clears _spPos) captures from the spawn eye. _spFollowDue is the pure decision: never while the deploy shots (+1.2s/+9s) are pending, never before a first capture exists, one re-shoot per SP_FOLLOW_MS (5 s), only past SP_FOLLOW_DIST (40 u, 3D) from the last capture point. The trigger re-shoots from player.pos — its y IS the eye (1251) — through the ONE existing pipeline (1186's ACES-inverse/PMREM/sky-scale), never a fork; both IS_COARSE gates intact.

Two pins moved. test-1186's probeGlsl slice was a {0,6000} character budget with 510 chars of slack — this build's in-probe comments spent it; it is an unbounded lazy match now, anchored on the unique dashed header (the recorded 1149/1351 conversion). test-1195's baked:false literal flipped with the design; its intent — the flag lives in DEFAULT_WORLD and rides the whole-world serialization — is unchanged.

EVIDENCE:
All executed in tests/test-1370-baked-on-probe-follows.mjs (39 checks) against the REAL extracted functions on the verified base (git head 5012844, baseline suite 1106/1106 run before editing). Legacy story: _worldFrom run with the REAL DEFAULT_WORLD literal gives baked true for null AND for a legacy world block with no baked key (the documented inherit decision), honours explicit false and explicit true; the bounding mechanism pinned (applyWorldCfg forces the boolean; serializeLevel writes `world: Object.assign({}, worldCfg)`). Follow decision on a fake clock: 30 u and 39.9 u quiet, 41 u fires, 3D distance fires (the vertical term counts), 4 s after the last capture throttled and 5.001 s fires, a pending deploy queue refuses even at 200 u, no _spRT and no _spPos each refuse, and the ring is centred on the LAST CAPTURE POINT — 10 u from a followed probe at x=100 is quiet while walking the 100 u back to spawn fires. Wiring, driving the real _spTick: a player 50 u out produces exactly one buildSceneProbe(50, 1.7, 0) — the player EYE; 5 u produces none; 500 u during the deploy window produces none; IS_COARSE produces none; a moved sky takes the rebuild branch with NO position args (in-place re-capture via the _spPos fallback) and RETURNS, so one tick never fires two captures. No fork: exactly one `function buildSceneProbe(`, one ACES-inverse matrix set, one `_spPM.fromCubemap`; explicit-wins / in-place / spawn-eye fallback and both IS_COARSE gates pinned; every successful capture records _spPos; requestSceneProbe clears it. test-01-syntax PASS, test-202-boot PASS, moved pins pass (test-1186 56 checks, test-1195 56 checks), full suite 1107/1107 (baseline 1106 + this build's test, zero failing). The bake's boot-time gates were read, not assumed: _bakeTick waits on _glbPending === 0 and is frame-budgeted (6 ms, 2 ms under the adaptive ladder per 1206), so flipping the default cannot hitch a load.

RISKS:
1) The visual effect is browser-verify only: the bake now runs on the stock level for everyone (eyeball interiors and creases once — indirect-only darkening, direct sun untouched), and a follow re-shoot costs six scene renders + a PMREM per fire — the same cost class as the existing 3 s day-cycle refresh, at most once per 5 s while moving through a big level; a machine near the adaptive ladder threshold now pays it on movement. 2) The environment SNAPS on re-capture (no cross-fade), so mirror-like metals can visibly pop when the player crosses the 40 u ring; accepted against being wrong everywhere, and easing the swap is a natural follow-up if reported from play. 3) Pre-1195 levels inherit crease darkening by documented decision (the finding's suggested reading); if a report says an old level looks different, the lever is that level's own Baked checkbox — an explicit false is honoured forever. 4) restoreLevel paths that skip startGame keep a stale _spPos briefly (only startGame's requestSceneProbe resets to spawn); the follow trigger self-heals from the player's real position within one 5 s window, so the exposure is one possibly-misplaced capture. 5) The character-budget conversion in test-1186 widens its probeGlsl window's START to the unique dashed section header; if a future build inserts a second `---------- build 1186: the SCENE reflection probe ----------` header the slice would silently rebind — unlikely, but it is a phrase-uniqueness pin (the 1346 lesson).
## Hunt mode joins the perception model (build 1371 — feel review #7)

## Hunt mode joins the perception model (build 1371 — feel review #7)

The patrol/hold branch has always had a full perception model — detectR, LOS, lkp, give-up grace, alert propagation — and the HUNT branch, the default and hardcoded on every random-wave spawn, bypassed all of it: the never-seen fallback chased the target's LIVE position from any distance, through walls, on frame 1 (measured: a grunt 75.1 m out, aware of nothing, beelining the player). And shootCd was seeded once at spawn and ticked down while the enemy walked, so one rounding a corner with it long expired fired on frame 1 of contact.

Two changes. (1) Live pursuit is EARNED: `en.aware || dist <= (en.detectR||18)*HUNT_ACQ_MUL` (2.5x — hunt stays the eager mode; the sight branch itself stays unranged, which is the relentless-pursuer feel). A cold hunt advances on `en._huntObj` — where its target stood on the FIRST COLD FRAME, captured once, so the wave converges on where you WERE. Stated deviation: the capture is lazy inside `enemyDesiredTarget`, not literally in `spawnEnemy` — at spawn the resolved target does not exist yet (the picker runs per frame; under 1355's factions the player may not even be this enemy's target), so a literal spawn capture would be a second write site and faction-wrong; for a wave spawn the first cold frame IS the frame after spawn. `aware` is sticky in hunt (only sight, alertEnemy and the `calm` verb touch it), so once genuinely engaged — or alerted, then trail-expired — the fallback is byte-compatible with the old code; gunfire stays the dinner bell through the existing lkp branch. `calm` deliberately does NOT clear `_huntObj`: re-capturing after a stealth reset would leak the live position. (2) Reaction delay on the aware rising edge — 1214/1315's own edge, the one place all four aware-setters pass — floors `shootCd` to 0.35–0.60 s and `cooldown` to 0.25 (melee windup + charger lunge), `Math.max` so a pending cooldown is never shortened, `||0` so a bare stub cannot NaN (1169), and it sits above the same loop body's decrement + fire gates so the very first contact frame is covered.

Patrol/hold text is byte-identical; friendly/`_noTgt` (1226/1355) are demoted to patrol before the hunt branch and untouched. Two pins moved, intents kept: test-1202 (rig gained `HUNT_ACQ_MUL` via extractConst; `ty:` count 5→6 — the fallback split into two returns) and test-1315 (the edge pin no longer requires the block to END at the vocal). test-17's "hunt chases from any range" survives unchanged — its sandbox has universal LOS, so it exercises the deliberately unranged sight branch.

EVIDENCE:
All from the executed harness (tests/test-1371-hunt-acquisition.mjs, 52 checks) driving the REAL extracted enemyDesiredTarget/alertEnemy and the REAL frame-loop edge block sliced from source. Acquisition matrix: a cold hunt at 75.1 m returns chase:true toward (0,30,y2.9), captures en._huntObj once, and two later calls with the target moved to (55,-60) and (-70,12) still return (0,30) — the live position never leaks; at dist 44 (inside 18*2.5) the live position is chased and NO objective is captured; the boundary is inclusive (no capture at exactly 45, capture at 45.0001) and scales with an authored detectR (30 -> live inside 75); the real alertEnemy at any range sets aware+lkp and the next call heads to the threat spot (20,-20), and after arrival + the 2.5 s give-up the trail clears while aware stays — live pursuit resumes at (-5,77), the exact pre-1371 hunt; a seen hunt at 70 m is unchanged (see:true, aware+lkp with storey 3.2), sight-lost heads to lkp, trail-expired resumes live, and _huntObj is never captured; friendly and _noTgt enemies in hunt mode patrol, never engage, never capture (1226/1355 untouched); hold returns its post; the patrol/hold source section contains no HUNT_ACQ_MUL/_huntObj. Reaction delay, executed on the sliced edge: one rising edge floors shootCd into [0.35,0.60] (200-sample bounds sweep) and cooldown to exactly 0.25 while the onspot event and vocal still fire once; a second frame with aware held does NOT re-floor (0.05/0.01 kept); a pending shootCd 5 / cooldown 3 is never shortened; the falling edge re-arms and a re-acquisition floors again; an undefined-timer stub floors cleanly (the ||0 NaN guard); source order pins prove event -> vocal -> floors inside the block, before the same loop body's `en.shootCd -= dt` decrement/fire gate. Suite: baseline 1106/1106 on the verified base (5012844), after: syntax PASS, boot PASS, 1107/1107 with only the two deliberate pin moves (test-1202: rig gained HUNT_ACQ_MUL via extractConst, ty: count 5->6; test-1315: edge pin no longer requires the block to end at the vocal). test-17/20/283/284/416/1226/1355 pass untouched — test-17's "hunt chases from any range" exercises the deliberately unranged SIGHT branch (its sandbox has universal LOS).

RISKS:
1) The spawn objective is captured on the FIRST COLD FRAME inside enemyDesiredTarget, not literally in spawnEnemy — a stated deviation from the finding's letter: at spawn the resolved target does not exist yet (the per-frame picker; under 1355's factions the player may not even be this enemy's target), so a literal spawn capture would be a second write site and faction-wrong. For a wave spawn the first cold frame is the frame after spawn, functionally the spawn-time position. Consequence: an enemy that starts INSIDE acquisition range and whose target later leaves it without ever being seen captures the objective at the moment the range gate first fails (where the trail went cold) — one position snapshot, same class as the wave capture. 2) A silent player more than detectR*2.5 (~45 m default) from their own wave-start position will see the wave mill around that old spot until they close range, fire (HEAR_RADIUS 40 alert), or are seen — the intended search behaviour, but a real feel change from "relentless beeline" that deserves one browser pass on a large arena. 3) The reaction delay also floors an enemy alerted by gunfire, slightly delaying the first return shot after sniping a wave — intended ("a beat of counterplay both ways") but worth knowing when tuning. 4) The `calm` logic verb deliberately does NOT clear _huntObj (re-capturing after a stealth reset would leak the live position once); a calmed enemy that goes cold heads back toward its stale objective. 5) Tuning (2.5x, 0.35-0.60 s, 0.25 s) is per the finding's numbers, not play-tested; the levers are HUNT_ACQ_MUL and the two floor literals at the edge. 6) Host-side only, like all PvE AI — co-op clients mirror positions and inherit the behaviour for free.
## Waves stage around the player (build 1372 — feel review #8)

## Waves stage around the player (build 1372 — feel review #8)

The formula wave was a ring of hunt capsules around the ORIGIN — a player who crossed the map fought every wave from one side — with no direction bias, a flat 0.6 s spawn metronome, and two types (runner 11-13, sapper 9.5-12.5) flatly faster than a sprinting player, so "run away" was never an answer.

Four changes, formula path ONLY. `randomWaveDescriptors` centres the ring on the player (typeof-guarded read; the bare-scope fallback is exactly the old (0,0) centre, which is what keeps test-21/62's extracted rigs green), draws the spawn direction ~2:1 from the rear half (forward is (-sin yaw, -cos yaw), so behind is sin(a+yaw)>0), and emits per-descriptor `delay` gaps: squads of 3-5, bases 0.8-1.4 s apart capped at 4 s, 0-0.25 s intra jitter, sorted then DELTA-ENCODED. The spawn loop reads the head descriptor's gap, defaulting to 0.6 when absent — so manifest waves, markers and the milestone boss (whose push literal is byte-identical) keep the old metronome by construction, `startWave` is untouched, and `_hostilePending` never sees the difference (delay is data it ignores). out[0] keeps its absolute (~0-0.25 s) which the loop never reads: first contact rides the residual timer exactly as before. Runner 10.5-11.5 and sapper max 11.8 edit the ENEMY_TYPES literal, so 1191's ENEMY_BASE inherits and spd overrides multiply the new bases.

**The proximity floor must test the CLAMPED candidate.** My first draft rejected raw points within 12 m of the player — dead code, since a raw candidate is ALWAYS at ring distance (0.6·arena ≥ 42). The lap-spawn is a post-clamp phenomenon (corner player, rear at the wall), so the loop now computes the wall-clamped qx/qz per try and rejects on THAT, emitting the clamped point — in-bounds is a guarantee, not a hope. Found via the other first-draft mistake: asserting the sample CENTROID sits near the player. Rear bias plus wall rejection legitimately drags the mean (25.3 m off); the ring property is distance-from-player, and that is what the test measures now.

One pin moved: test-1154's speed sweep regex was integer-only and would silently drop the now-decimal runner; it matches decimals now (8 types instead of an integer accident — strictly stronger). test-407's push-prefix pin survives because the push literal keeps its exact prefix.

EVIDENCE:
All from tests/test-1372-wave-staging.mjs (68 checks) driving the REAL extracted randomWaveDescriptors / manifestWaveDescriptors / _hostilePending / _enemyEff and the REAL spawn-consume block sliced from loop(), under a seeded LCG. Ring: player at (30,-20) in arena 70 — 450/450 spawns sit at true ring distance 42-63 m FROM THE PLAYER, 0 out of bounds, 0 beyond ring reach (the origin ring put them up to ~99 m away), 0 within 12 m; corner player (60,60) — 600/600 in-bounds (hard clamp), 10/600 (1.7%) within 12 m, all from the 8-try fallback. Rear bias: yaw 2.1, 1380 samples — 911 behind vs 469 ahead = 1.94:1. Delays, wave 6 (15 members): first arrival t=0.03 s, span 3.78 s, 3 inter-squad gaps > 0.5 s, 12 intra gaps < 0.26 s; wave 20 (43 members) span 4.24 s — the 4 s cap holds. Spawn loop replay at 60 fps: a no-delay queue spawns at the exact 0.6 s metronome (manifest/markers byte-identical pacing), every formula delta gap honoured within one frame, whole wave on the field in <= 4.5 s, and the queue never wedges. Milestone boss: pushed last at (0, -50.4) with NO delay field, push literal byte-identical, absent off-cadence. Manifest descriptors carry exactly x,z,mode,type. _hostilePending: 9 delayed hostiles + 1 friendly + 1 fac:0 -> 9. Speeds: runner 10.5/11.5, sapper 9.5/11.8; 1191 overrides win (2x runner -> 23; 1.5x sapper -> 14.25/17.7). Existing guards re-run green: test-21/62 (constant-rng rigs, boss cadence), test-407 (push-prefix pin, untouched), test-1154 (widened decimal regex now reads 9 speed pairs), test-1179 (manifest loader lines), test-1191/1213/1226/481/487/17/33/27/79. Suite 1106/1106 baseline -> 1107/1107 after, zero failing.

RISKS:
1) Tuning values (squads of 3-5, bases 0.8-1.4 s capped at 4 s, 0.25 s jitter, 12 m proximity floor, 2/3 rear draw) are reasoned, not play-tested — a browser pass should feel one mid wave; every lever is a literal inside randomWaveDescriptors. 2) Deep waves change pacing deliberately and materially: wave 20 previously dripped over ~26 s at the 0.6 metronome and now arrives in ~4.3 s of squads — that is what the finding specified ("a wave arrives over ~2-4 s"), but it is the largest felt change; the 4 s cap is the lever if it overwhelms. 3) A player standing against a wall gets a visible fraction of spawns clamped ONTO the boundary (the raw-bounds rejection re-rolls 8 times first, so in the measured open-field case 450/450 were at true ring distance); a wall-hugging player will see some wall spawns, and 1.7% of corner-case spawns still land within 12 m via the 8-try fallback. 4) randomWaveDescriptors reads the module-level `player` at call time — safe today (its only call site is startWave, play-time, and player is a const declared at module level), and the typeof guard degrades to the old origin centre in any scope without it; but the rear bias keys off player.yaw, which in cursor-aim views (build 1103) is the cursor direction rather than the travel direction — "away from where you are looking" is still the intended reading. 5) My first draft failed its own test twice, both instructive: a sample-CENTROID assertion (rear bias + wall rejection legitimately drag the mean 25 m off the player — the right measurand is distance-from-player), and a proximity floor testing the RAW candidate, which is always at ring distance and therefore dead code — the shipped version tests the CLAMPED point, which is the one that can land in a corner player's lap.
## The DPS table is ordered, ADS is per-weapon, and fire punches the lens (build 1373 — feel review #10/#11/#12)

## The DPS table is ordered, and firing finally has weight (build 1373 — feel review #10/#11/#12)

Verified before fixing: sustained DPS was INVERTED — pistol 26/170 ms = 152.9 the highest in the game, the STARTING rifle the worst automatic at 126.3, sniper 95 one-shotting every non-boss body shot including the 90 hp brute; ADS took one global ~164 ms (adsBlend eased at a flat dt*14 — t90 = ln(10)/14 is exactly 164.5 ms, confirming the report) while drawMs was already per-weapon; no FOV response to firing; and standing spread was a CONSTANT, so shot 30 of a mag dump was as accurate as shot 1.

Four changes. (1) Three damage numbers and NOTHING else: rifle 12→15 (157.9 — the primary leads), pistol 26→20 (117.6 — a sidearm again), sniper 95→80. The brute survives with 10 hp; the CHARGER's base 75 is under 80 — stated in the test rather than papered over — but the formula never spawns one before wave 12 (1213), where the hp ramp puts it ≥ 111; pinned against the real ramp literal. (2) adsMs joins 1190's sheet (serializer diff, loaders, clamp, editor row free). **The clamp floors at 0, not the finding's 80** — melee ships 0 (no ramp) and a floor above a factory value writes a spurious st diff into every saved level (1296's rule, the pellets/windup precedent); the divide-by-zero guard lives in `_adsK`, which floors the divide at 40 ms, so a hostile adsMs:0 is merely near-instant ADS — weaker than the spread:0 the sheet already allows. Boot parity is EXECUTED across all 13 keys. (3) The fire FOV punch lives INSIDE `_recKick` so both fire sites inherit the fps gate; scaled by kickV, steadied ×0.6 by ADS, gated by a11y.shake (comfort motion — the aim recoil above it stays ungated, deliberately), decaying `exp(-8dt)` to exactly 0 beside `_sprintFovCur` in the wantFov sum (1210/1222's pattern). (4) Bloom rides INSIDE `_curSpread`: +max(spread*0.35, 0.004)/shot, cap 1.5× base (total ≤ ~2.5×) or 0.02 zero-spread, a pure-timestamp drain to exactly zero in ~400 ms — framerate-independent by construction, and the crosshair shows it for free (1219's one-function rule, re-pinned). shoot() reads its spread BEFORE adding, so the first shot of a burst is the accurate one.

Ten pins moved across ten files (227, 976, 1296, 1190, 1219, 1161, 1362, 1222 ×2, 1210, 964), every one keeping its intent; the 1219/1362 rigs gained the new dependencies supplied inert.

EVIDENCE:
All from executed harnesses on the verified base (bf18f82, build 1370 — newer than the briefed baseline commit; baseline suite ran 1108/1108 before editing). New test tests/test-1373-weapon-feel-dps.mjs: 67 checks. DPS, from the real WEAPONS table: rifle 15 → 157.9 sustained, pistol 20 → 117.6, both asserted ordered against the SMG's 145.5 (the pre-fix inversion was 126.3 vs 152.9); sniper 80 leaves the 90 hp brute standing, and the CHARGER case is handled honestly — base hp 75 is stated as still one-shot for an AUTHORED wave-1 charger, while every formula-spawned charger (wave >= 12, build 1213) carries the ramp (75 * 1.48 >= 111 > 80), pinned against the real ramp literal so a retune reopens the question loudly. adsMs: all eight table values asserted (180/140/150/220/320/300/0/0), KEYS.length 13, LIM.adsMs '0,600', and GUN_BASE PARITY EXECUTED — the real capture block + _wepApplyStats(k, null) over every weapon, then the serializer's own diff loop, returns an empty list across all 13 keys (with the finding's literal 80 floor it would have emitted crowbar/hands adsMs 0 -> 80 into every saved level). ADS ease: dt*14 proven gone, _adsK executed — t90 at 60 fps: pistol 133 ms < rifle 167 < shotgun 217 < sniper 317 (rifle inside [135, 207] of its stated 180 — the same Euler offset the old dt*14 had); melee 0 blends in one frame through the 40 ms divide floor; absent adsMs reads k ~= 14.04 (the old global); NaN safe. FOV punch, real _recKick executed: 0.034 kickV -> exactly 2.89 deg; a11y.shake 0 -> punch exactly 0 while _recPitch still moves (recoil stays gameplay); ADS x0.6; top view 0 (1102's gate, shared with the rocket site); 200-shot spam clamps at exactly 6; _fireFovStep at 30/60/144 Hz lands on 3*e^-4 to 1e-9 and settles to literal 0; decay-before-sum ordering and the wantFov term pinned. Bloom, real functions under a stubbed clock: rifle floors 0.004/shot, caps 0.02, drains monotonically to EXACTLY 0 at 400 ms and stays; shotgun 0.028/shot, caps 0.12 (total <= ~2.5x base); two same-instant reads identical (pure timestamp decay, no mutation); shoot() adds AFTER reading (first shot accurate); both consumers pinned on the one _curSpread; end-to-end _curSpread inherits exactly a live 0.011 bloom. Ten pins moved across ten files (227, 976, 1296, 1190, 1219, 1161, 1362, 1222 x2, 1210, 964) — every one re-run individually and passing with its intent intact (1219/1362's executing rigs gained the new dependencies supplied inert; test-1102's _recKick gate pin passes untouched). test-01-syntax PASS, test-202-boot PASS, full suite 1109/1109 (baseline 1108 + this build's test, zero failing).

RISKS:
1) One deliberate deviation from the finding: GUN_STAT_LIM.adsMs is [0,600], not [80,600]. The 80 floor is incompatible with the finding's own "melee 0" — the clamp runs on every factory apply, so a floor above the 0 baseline writes a spurious st:{adsMs:80} diff into every saved level, the exact defect build 1296 recorded and fixed twice (pellets, magSize). The executed parity test proves the [0,600] form clean and would fail loudly on the [80,600] form. The hostile-file guard the 80 floor was for lives in _adsK's 40 ms divide floor instead; an authored adsMs 1 is merely near-instant ADS, strictly weaker than the spread:0 the sheet already allows. 2) The charger contradiction in the finding is real: charger base hp is 75 < the mandated sniper 80, so an AUTHORED wave-1 charger still one-shots; only formula-spawned chargers (wave >= 12 ramp) survive. Implemented exactly as instructed ("sniper 95 -> 80. Nothing else") and stated in the test; if base-hp chargers must survive, the lever is sniper <= 74 or charger hp >= 81 — a follow-up tuning call, not silently taken here. 3) The base tree is build 1370 (bf18f82), newer than the briefed 1106-baseline commit; sibling worktrees (presumably 1371/1372) may also touch feel code — the WEAPONS table lines, _recKick, the wantFov block and _curSpread are the likely collision surfaces. The script's count-asserted anchors abort atomically on any drift; re-run it on the real landing tree if siblings land first. 4) Feel numbers (FIRE_FOV_SCALE 85 / MAX 6 / DECAY 8; bloom 0.35 per shot, 0.004 floor, cap read as TOTAL <= ~2.5x base i.e. bloom <= 1.5x base) are reasoned and property-tested, not play-tested — a browser pass should confirm the shotgun/sniper punch reads and sustained SMG fire pumps gently (~2 deg steady) rather than nauseates; every lever is a named constant with its derivation in the comment. If the reviewer meant the BLOOM itself caps at 2.5x base, the lever is one multiplier in _bloomCapFor. 5) Melee ADS now blends in ~40 ms instead of the old 164 (the deliberate reading of "melee 0" = no ramp); visible only when a creator authors an aim pose for a melee weapon. 6) _fireFov/_fireBloom are not zeroed at the game-reset line (left untouched to avoid moving more pins); both self-drain in under half a second (exponential / timestamp), so the worst residue after a respawn is sub-degree and sub-half-second. 7) docs/REFERENCE.md still lists the old damage values — touching docs was out of scope for this build; a docs sweep should follow. 8) The FOV punch is fps-view-only (inside _recKick's 1102 gate) and freezes rather than decays while driving/turret (those branches skip the wantFov block is false — the decay line runs in the main loop unconditionally, so it in fact drains everywhere; only the ADD is gated), so no stale punch can survive a view switch.
## The mix gets a room, a duck, real layers, and an ambience bed (build 1374 — audio review #5/#9)

## The mix gets a room, a duck, layers and a bed (build 1374 — audio review #5/#9 + papercut)

Verified first: zero ConvolverNode in the file (an interior and an open arena were sonically identical), musicBus wired straight to master with nothing ducking it (~22.6 dB under the loudest SFX), intensity one scalar fader on the 260 ms metronome, and the world silent between events. Four pieces, all bus-level so no SFX call site changed:

- **REVERB is a parallel SEND** (sfxBus -> convolver -> 0.18 wet -> master) with a GENERATED IR: 2 s of exponentially decaying noise (-60 dB tail, `pow(0.001, i/n)`), each channel rolled independently so the tail is stereo-decorrelated. No `createConvolver` — or a throwing one — skips cleanly and the 1211 dry chain stays byte-identical (executed all three ways).
- **The SIDECHAIN duck** sits BETWEEN musicBus and master, so `applyAudioSettings` keeps sole ownership of `musicBus.gain` (the one-writer rule). `SFX.shoot`/`SFX.explode` dip it to 0.45; recovery is `setTargetAtTime` (tau 0.12 — ~95% back in 0.36 s), cancel-first so rapid fire re-dips instead of stacking. Audio-thread scheduling only: zero per-frame JS.
- **The score is LAYERS on the existing 260 ms step**: drone always-on above a 0.30 floor, bass gated 0.04→0.3 (it used to enter at effectively-always, so nothing ever ENTERED), hat 0.35→0.5, and a fifth-above counter-drone (MUSIC_ROOT*3, triangle) past 0.75 — seated silent at proc start so existence never changes mid-play, the gain does the gating. Element gains ~8 dB toward parity (0.045→0.11, 0.06→0.15, 0.04→0.10); musicBus stays at the authored 0.6.
- **The AMBIENCE BED**: looping mono filtered noise (lowpass wandering 450–850 Hz on a sub-Hz LFO into the frequency PARAM — audio-thread only) at 0.02 into musicBus, so the editor mute, the music slider and the duck all cover it free; plus 6–18 s one-shots (rumble/whistle) at ~30 m random azimuth through `_spatialOut`, gated on gameOn and not-editing, always re-armed on a gated skip. `startMusic`/`stopMusic` own the lifecycle on BOTH music paths, so every silence path inherits it. `gameOn`/`camera` are read only from timer callbacks — no TDZ (documented at the site).

Five pins moved (44, 49, 53 ×2, 1363's shoot-rig anchor + stub), each keeping its intent; 49's "fades to near-silence" intent deliberately became the always-on floor, which is the finding.

EVIDENCE:
All from tests/test-1374-reverb-duck-layers-ambience.mjs (111 checks), which executes the REAL extracted functions against the 1208/1363 fake-WebAudio-graph pattern, on the verified base (bf18f82, build 1370; baseline suite 1108/1108 run before editing). REVERB: buildAudioBuses executed three ways — with a convolver, sfxBus has exactly two outputs (dry compressor -> master unchanged, plus convolver -> 0.18 wet gain -> master, the wet value read from the shipped const line); the generated IR is stereo (2 ch), exactly 2 s, channels decorrelated (1000/1000 samples differ), and each quarter-to-quarter amplitude ratio sits in [4,8] around the analytic 5.62 for a -60 dB exponential tail with end-to-end decay > 60x; with createConvolver ABSENT and with it THROWING, no throw, _sfxVerb null, the dry chain and duck byte-identical; double-call idempotent. DUCK: _duckMusic executed — exactly three scheduled ops in order cancel -> set(0.45 at now) -> setTargetAtTime(1, tau 0.12 = ~95% in 0.36 s); null-node no-op; no setInterval/setTimeout/rAF anywhere in it (zero per-frame work); exactly 2 call sites (shoot, explode). LAYERS: _musicStepFn executed at intensities 0/0.2/0.4/0.6/0.8/1 across beats — drone floor 0.033 at intensity 0 (was 0), no bass at 0.2 (old gate 0.04), bass at 0.4 (55 Hz, gain 0.15*inten), no hat at 0.4 on an off-beat, hat at 0.6 beat 1 (6 kHz highpass, gain 0.10*inten), none on beat 0, counter-drone 0.04 at 0.8 and parked <= 0.0001 below; drone tops at 0.11 (was 0.045); all three gates textually inside the step fn, metronome pinned at 260 ms, counter gain has exactly 2 writers. _startProcMusic executed: counter at 330 Hz, gain 0, started. LIFECYCLE: startMusic executed 4 ways — editor open starts NOTHING, proc path logs amb,proc, custom-track path logs amb,load:x.mp3, already-on is a no-op; stopMusic ends in _stopAmbience() and fades/releases the counter. BED: _startAmbience executed — looping mono source -> 650 Hz lowpass (450-850 wander via a 0.06 Hz LFO gain connected into the frequency PARAM) -> 0.02 gain -> musicBus; timer armed in [6000,18000]; idempotent. One-shots: skipped-but-re-armed with gameOn false and with editorOpen true; live fire lands one noise/tone at exactly 30 m horizontal from the camera at ear height, vol <= 0.08/0.04; arm extremes 6000 and ~18000 ms; after stop a stray fire neither re-arms nor sounds. PINS: the 1211 compressor block, its fallback, and all three 1208 _spatialOut fallbacks asserted byte-identical; test-1208 and test-1211 pass untouched. Moved pins re-run green: 44 (25), 49 (3), 53 (29), 1363 (121), plus neighbours 74/331/423. Script verified reproducible: reset touched files to HEAD, re-ran the complete script, diffed byte-identical against the verified tree; final chain on that tree: syntax PASS, boot PASS, 1109/1109 (baseline 1108 + this build's test, zero failing).

RISKS:
1) The worktree landed on build 1370 (bf18f82), not the briefed 1368, and the baseline was 1108/1108, not the briefed 1106/1106 — the branch had advanced (builds 1369/1370 landed after the brief was written). All anchors are exact literals of the 1370 tree with count-asserted rep()s that abort atomically on any drift, so applying against a different tree fails loudly rather than mixing. 2) Everything audible is proven structurally and numerically, not by ear: the 0.18 wet mix, the 0.45/0.36 s duck, the ~8 dB layer raise, the 0.02 bed and the 6-18 s one-shot volumes are the finding's numbers, and a browser listen should confirm the room is subtle, gunfire still sits on top of the raised music, and the bed reads as air rather than hiss — every lever is a named constant (REVERB_WET, DUCK_TO/DUCK_TAU, the dg table, AMB_*). 3) The reverb send taps sfxBus, so build 1363's UI clicks get the same 0.18 room as world SFX — accepted as specified ("a wet/dry SEND off sfxBus"); if UI dryness is ever wanted, the fix is routing UI sounds around the bus, not a smaller wet. 4) The drone's always-on floor means play is never fully silent even at intensity 0 — that is the finding's explicit intent, but it deliberately reverses build 70's "fades to near-silence between waves" (test-49's pin moved with a note saying so). 5) The duck also dips the ambience bed and any custom music track (both ride musicBus) — intended: a transient should push the whole non-SFX layer down. 6) One-shots fire while PAUSED if gameOn stays true, consistent with music continuing through pause; gate on paused too if a report objects. 7) The IR and bed buffers allocate ~1.2 MB total of Float32Array once per session (IR once at bus build, bed cached across restarts) — checked, not per-restart.
## The pause menu is tabbed (build 1375 — UI review #2)

## The pause menu is tabbed, and Exit is always on screen (build 1375 — UI review #2)

The pause menu WAS the settings menu: 36 controls in one scrolling column, 55% visible at 900 px, Exit to main menu below the fold — and the markup carried two LITERAL backslash-u2014 sequences (the aim-assist hint and the a11y hint) rendering as garbage text, because the escape that is deliberate house style in JS strings is just six characters in HTML. The other 400 literals are all inside script blocks and stay; a test now strips `<script>` blocks and asserts markup holds zero, so the class cannot return.

The card is four panels behind a strip of real `<button>`s (1347 focus rules free): GAME (camera/sprint/crouch, loadout, both credits, plus the postFx/adaptRes display toggles split out of the audio box), CONTROLS (touch editor, keybinds, pad panel, mouse rows), AUDIO (mute + three volumes), COMFORT (the whole a11y fold). **Every row moved byte-verbatim with its id** — bindPauseMenu and the a11y loader read by id, so no binding changed; test-872's exact-label pin passes untouched. The footer (Resume / Help / Exit) is a sibling AFTER `#pauseBody`, which is the scrolling element; the card itself CLIPS at `calc(88vh / var(--uiS,1))` — divided by --uiS because the zoom rule multiplies it back (1333), or a scaled-up interface pushes the footer off. `_pauseTabShow` is question-shaped (dataset match, unknown name falls back to game, scrollTop reset); the remembered tab is a session `var` — not `let`, because `bindPauseMenu()` runs at module level far below (the 1127/1331 TDZ trap) — re-applied on every open since openPause calls bindPauseMenu (907). No SFX in the tab handler: 1363's delegated listener already voices menu buttons. The boot harness's stub returns length 0, so the early return keeps boot silent. Pad nav needs nothing: hidden panels fail the rect check.

Two pins moved, intents kept: test-382's card-scroll pin (the scroll moved one level down — card clips, body scrolls) and test-1316's markup pin, which had been **asserting the defect** (the literal escape); it matches the real em-dash now. Executed: `_pauseTabShow` driven through switch / fallback / scroll-reset in test-1375 (91 checks). Suite 1108 → 1109/1109.

EVIDENCE:
Base verified before editing: git reset --hard FETCH_HEAD landed on bf18f82 "build 1370 — baked AO ships ON" (newer than the required "probe: shot-arena passed removeProp" at 5012844), baseline suite 1108/1108. All edits by ONE python script whose anchors assert count==1 and whose writes are atomic at the end; the markup pieces were CUT from the live file and reassembled, never retyped, so test-872's exact adaptResCb label pin and test-1166/261's exact button pins pass byte-identically. Verified after: test-01-syntax PASS, test-202-boot PASS (the boot stub's length-0 querySelectorAll takes _pauseTabShow's early return), new test-1375-pause-tabs 91 checks PASS — markup pins (4 real <button class="pTab"> tabs, 4 pPanel divs in order game<controls<audio<comfort<footer; per-panel membership of every row; footer holds pauseResume/pauseHelp/pauseExit as a SIBLING after #pauseBody), 27 moved ids counted exactly once each (pauseCredits pinned as the <button tag form because build 1277's JS comment quotes the id), zero literal backslash-u2014 outside script blocks with both hints matching the real em-dash, CSS pins (card overflow:hidden with max-height:calc(88vh / var(--uiS,1)) and the dvh twin; #pauseBody flex:1 1 auto + min-height:0 + overflow-y:auto; .pPanel display toggle), and the EXECUTED extracted _pauseTabShow: switch to comfort marks exactly that tab+panel and resets scrollTop 99→0, an unknown name falls back to game (panels [true,false,false,false]), _pauseTab remembered; wiring pins (tabs wired in bindPauseMenu which openPause calls on every open; var declared above the module-level bindPauseMenu() boot call; resumeGame unchanged so Escape/pointer-lock resume is intact). Post-conditions in the script: total literal u2014 402→400 with 0 in script-stripped markup. Two pins moved and re-run green: test-382 (9 checks — card-clips + body-scrolls, intent "options never cut off" kept) and test-1316 (57 checks — its pin had asserted the literal-escape defect; real em-dash now). Full suite 1109/1109 (1108 baseline + this build's test, zero failing). BUILD_VERSION untouched at build 1370 per the forbidden list; no commits made; only breach.html + tests/* touched.

RISKS:
1) The worktree base was build 1370 (bf18f82), not the briefed 1368 — builds 1369-1370 landed between the brief and this run. Every anchor is an exact literal of the 1370 tree with count-asserted rep()/cut() calls, so re-running on a further-moved tree aborts atomically on any drift; sibling builds 1371-1374 presumably exist in other worktrees, and the pause markup/CSS/bindPauseMenu region is one none of the recent build notes touch, but land in number order and let the anchor asserts arbitrate. 2) Look and feel need one browser eyeball: tab strip styling, the 440px fixed card width (the old card was content-sized ~430px; fixed width stops the card resizing between tabs), and the panelIn animation replaying on open — none of which a Node harness can judge. 3) Pad-navigation first focus in the pause menu now lands on the Game tab (first button in DOM order) instead of Resume; Start still resumes directly (button 9 path pinned by test-909/911) and hidden panels are excluded by the existing rect check, so nothing is unreachable — a deliberate, minor UX shift. 4) The postFx/adaptRes display toggles were assigned to the GAME panel (the finding named them in no tab; AUDIO was specified as "volume sliders" so the mute+volumes box was split verbatim) — if the orchestrator prefers them elsewhere it is a two-line markup move. 5) At uiScale below 75% the 88vh/uiS card can exceed the visual viewport height slightly on very short windows; the dvh twin divides identically so the footer stays visible at every uiScale the slider can reach (75-175%). 6) The finding's aside about "toggle buttons whose label is their value" (Camera:/Sprint:/Crouch:) was NOT restyled — the IMPLEMENT list did not ask for it and bindPauseMenu's label-updater logic is untouched; recorded so it is not read as forgotten.
## A mover refresh stops touching vertices, and the texture caches learn to let go (build 1376 — perf review #7/#8)

## Movers ride cached local boxes, and the texture caches evict (build 1376 — perf #7/#8)

Two defects. (1) `updateXAnim -> refreshPropCollider` paid the FULL precise derivation per frame per animated prop: `Box3().setFromObject(obj, true)` transforms every vertex, the per-mesh loop transforms every vertex AGAIN, and a moving MODEL re-derived (or re-posted to the 1203 worker) its whole footprint grid on top — plus an O(colliders) `indexOf` per prop per frame. (2) `texCache`/`_texInst` had ZERO delete sites across level swaps, and `_texInst` keyed by TILING, so one 4096 image at three tilings was three decodes and three ~85 MB uploads.

Fixes: the slow path records its own output in prop-LOCAL space (`userData._localBox`/`_localBoxes` + a version stamp `_pcStamp` vs `_pcGen`, plus a child-count check); a MOVER refresh (`refreshPropCollider(o, true)` — updateXAnim and the 1309 parent-follow tick) is then Box3.copy+applyMatrix4 into REUSED Box3s. Translation exact; rotation conservative (AABB of the rotated box — fail SOLID, 1148's rule); a transformed BOX mesh exact to 1e-9 (executed). The noCol branch DROPS the cache (its un-tick must re-run the raycast-restoring traverse); a landed worker grid REBUILDS it so the grid rides the movement; a fast refresh bumps `_mgridTok` so a stale in-flight grid cannot land (1203). `userData._inColliders` (set at the 4 prop push sites, cleared at all 7 removals) replaces the indexOf. `_cgMobileNow`, `_bakeSig` and the first-line `_cgDirty` guard are byte-untouched (pinned). texInstance now fetches ONE base per (url, colorspace); tilings are `Texture.clone()`s sharing `.source` — r149's copy-shares-source AND the sampler-state GL cache key excluding repeat/offset/rotation are pinned against the vendored build; pre-load clones park at version 0 and re-arm on the base onLoad (or the renderer warns per frame). `_evictTexCaches` disposes+empties both caches (+bases) at `_wipeSceneCore` and BOTH level-swap teardowns, never disposing textures on live shared materials (floorMat/wallMat/`_trkM.road` stay cached); `_procSurface` maps are in neither cache (pinned). The 1353 census dedupes by `t.source`. Pins moved: 111, 1188, 1250, 1353 — intents kept. Suite 1109/1109 (baseline 1108 + test-1376's 90 checks).

EVIDENCE:
All from the executed suite on the verified base (git head bf18f82 "build 1370" — newer than the required "probe: shot-arena" commit 5012844; baseline run BEFORE editing: 1108/1108). New test tests/test-1376-mover-fastpath-tex-evict.mjs: 90 checks, all executing the REAL extracted functions. Fast path: a box mesh cached at one pose, then rotated+scaled+translated, matches Box3.setFromObject(obj, true) to 1e-9 on all six components of BOTH the overall box and the per-part box; a two-mesh group (cylinder + box) under pure translation is exact to 1e-9; a rotated sphere's fast box CONTAINS the precise box (fail-solid); a bumped _pcGen stamp refuses the fast path (fastRefresh returns false) and the mover call falls back to a fresh precise Box3, then re-syncs; a changed child count refuses it; a flag-less call is always precise; noCol drops the cache (null) and the un-tick rebuilds it; an fx emitter never builds one. Model grids: a 3-box grid (with a lintel over a doorway) cached fromMeshes=false survives as 3 boxes, translates exactly (box0.min.x -5→15, lintel keeps its 2.5 height band — the doorway stays OPEN), and a fast refresh bumps _mgridTok 5→6 so a stale worker answer is refused at delivery (1203's own check, pinned intact in test-1203 which passes untouched). Pins: updateXAnim contains zero colliders.indexOf; _inColliders=true at exactly 4 sites, =false at exactly 7; _cgMobileNow and _bakeSig byte-exact with no reference to the new cache; the _cgDirty guard still first. Textures: three tilings of one url = ONE FakeLoader fetch with all clones sharing .source (real r149 clone), per-clone repeat/rotation, pre-load clones parked at version 0 and re-armed by the base onLoad, a linear request gets its own base; vendored three.cjs pinned — Texture.copy contains `this.source = source.source;` and `this.needsUpdate = true;`, getTextureCacheKey has wrapS/minFilter/format and NO repeat/offset/rotation, and `_sources.set( source, webglTextures )` + `webglTextures[ textureCacheKey ]` exist (same source + same sampler state = one GL texture). Eviction executed: dead entries disposed and both caches (+base/pend maps) emptied, floorMat.map and _trkM.road.map neither disposed nor evicted (stay cached), procSurf canvas maps untouched and still assigned; _procSurface references neither cache; _wipeSceneCore and restoreLevel (after freeUnusedModels — order asserted) both call _evictTexCaches, and the same line landed in loadLevelFromNet (the other level-swap teardown). Census: two tilings sharing one Source + one standalone count as 2, bytes counted once per source. Gates: test-01-syntax PASS, test-202-boot PASS (executes the source — no TDZ; all new consts sit above refreshPropCollider and eviction is only called at runtime). Four moved pins re-run individually and green: test-111 (17), test-1188 (316), test-1250 (104632), test-1353 (32); neighbours test-06, test-1203, test-1324, test-1309 pass untouched. Full suite: 1109/1109 harnesses passed (baseline 1108 + this build's test, zero failing). git status shows only breach.html + the four patched tests + the new test.

RISKS:
1) BASE TREE: the brief said "1106/1106 at commit 5012844 or newer"; the branch tip at fetch time was bf18f82 (build 1370, 1108/1108 baseline) — newer, as permitted. Every anchor is a literal of THAT tree and rep() aborts atomically on drift (it fired once: the freeUnusedModels purge line exists in BOTH loadLevelFromNet and restoreLevel; resolved by deliberately evicting at both level-swap teardowns with n=2, nothing half-applied). If sibling builds 1371-1375 land first and touch these regions, re-run the script — it fails loudly, never mixes. 2) ROTATING movers get conservative boxes: the fast path yields the AABB of the rotated cached box, fatter than today's per-frame re-derivation for non-box geometry and for model grids mid-rotation (translation — the common elevator/platform/sliding-door case — is exact, byte-tested). Fail-solid direction per 1148; a spinning windmill-blade prop's collider is coarser mid-spin than before. 3) Big animated models change failure shape for the better but differently: continuously animated >30k-tri models used to re-gather + re-post a worker job per frame whose answer the token always discarded (perpetual per-mesh interim boxes at full gather cost); now the cached boxes ride the delta with no gather. But a model that STOPS animating keeps its cached boxes until any event-driven slow refresh, where before the final frame's post could eventually land a tight grid — if an over-solid stopped GLB door is ever reported, the lever is a one-shot slow refresh when xa reaches rest. 4) Eviction runs on every wipe/restore, so an undo of a NON-transform edit (which reloads the level) now refetches textures through the browser HTTP cache — build 991's recorded trade for models, applied to textures; textured props may briefly show base colour after such an undo while images decode. If reported from play, gate the restoreLevel call (e.g. IS_COARSE like 991) or add a mark-and-sweep generation. 5) Child-MESH visibility flips inside an animating prop are not in the staleness checks (stamp + child count); the boxes keep the old membership until the next slow refresh — no current engine path toggles child-mesh visibility mid-play, and _pcGen is the documented hook if one arrives. 6) The pre-load clone parking depends on r149 copy() setting needsUpdate (clone parked at version 0, re-armed on the base onLoad); the fact is pinned against the vendored bundle so an upgrade fails the pin rather than silently warning per frame. 7) Perf claims are structural (vertex work and allocations removed per frame), not browser-measured — SwiftShader frame timing was out of scope per the FORBIDDEN list; a browser pass on a level with many animated doors is the honest confirmation.
## The editor fly camera learns to orbit (build 1377 — editor review #5)

Editor audit #5, the cheap half: fly-mode drag was a first-person LOOK, so turning to inspect a prop swung it off screen — every competitor orbits. Alt+LMB and MMB now orbit the fly camera about a pivot captured ONCE at drag start; per mousemove the camera POSITION is re-derived on the same radius (never integrated, so the radius is exact for the whole drag) and player.yaw/pitch are set to the orbit angles — the basis is the spherical form _edFrameSelected already uses (camera = pivot + r·(sin yaw·cp, −sin pitch, cos yaw·cp)), in which facing the pivot falls out by construction.

THE INPUT CLAIM, verified before choosing it: Alt+LMB over a PROP has been the drag-duplicate since build 441 and KEEPS it — its _pickPropAt branch runs before the orbit claim in the same handler, so orbit takes only Alt-drags starting on empty space. MMB was verified FREE in fly mode (the pan handler acts only in top view; the in-game grab returns while editorOpen; the vcam orbit requires gameOn without editorOpen), so MMB orbits unconditionally. Top view (marquee/pan), walk mode, plain drag-look, WASD, gizmo and the two-finger touch camera (1312) are untouched — the orbit writes flyPos, so it is fly-camera only, and _edOrbitStart refuses top view and walk mode.

PIVOT RESOLUTION, in order: (1) selCentroid over activeSel — deliberately NOT selectedSceneObject, because the props tab always has a primary at idx 0 even when the creator never clicked anything, and orbiting a crate on the far side of the map because it is entry 0 is the surprise this avoids; (2) the surface under the cursor via groundPointUnderPointer (the Alt-duplicate's own ray); (3) ~10 u ahead along the look. Deltas read _mouseSensNow(false), the look drag's own derivation, in the look drag's angular direction; pitch clamps ±1.5; both mouseups clear the drag; a degenerate pivot floors the radius at 0.75 and a straight-overhead capture cannot NaN.

Executed in test-1377 (94 checks): capture round-trips, radius exact through 90° and 50 arbitrary steps, facing exact including through the clamp, 2π of yaw returns the camera to its start, all three pivot ranks, refusals, moved-flag threshold, flyInit seeding. Three pins moved (332, 429, 1281 — the _mouseSensNow count went 4→5), each keeping its intent. NOT verified headless: the feel of the drag direction — one browser drag confirms it.

EVIDENCE:
Base verified: git reset to origin/claude/level-gen-themes-stairs-5slfr0 (bf18f82, build 1370 — newer than the stated marker); baseline suite ran 1108/1108 before any edit (the prompt's 1106 predates two builds on the branch). Claims verified in source before implementing: (1) fly-mode LMB drag is a pure first-person look (editorDragLook path, mousemove at the editor branch); (2) Alt+LMB is TAKEN over props — the build-441 drag-duplicate via _pickPropAt runs earlier in the same mousedown, and altKey has no other mouse use in the file; (3) MMB is FREE in fly mode — the button-1/2 handler acts only under editorTopView, the in-game MMB grab returns for editorOpen, chaseCursorOn() and _vcamOrbitOn() both require gameOn && !editorOpen; (4) the fly basis is forward=(-sin yaw·cp, sin pitch, -cos yaw·cp) and _edFrameSelected already places the camera at pivot + r·(sin yaw·cp, -sin pitch, cos yaw·cp), which the orbit reuses. New test-1377 (94 checks) EXECUTES the shipped functions: capture round-trips to the exact camera position; radius exact through 90° and 50 pseudo-random steps (re-derived, never integrated); facing == engine forward to 1e-9 at every step including through the ±1.5 pitch clamp; 2π of yaw returns the camera to its start; degenerate captures floor r at 0.75 and cannot NaN; pivot order selection→cursor→10u executed with all three ranks (selection outranks a live cursor hit) and pinned in source order; start refuses top view and walk mode; a 120px move preserves r=13 exactly, turns yaw by exactly -dx·sens (the look drag direction), sets player.yaw/pitch, and marks editorDragMoved; a 2px jiggle does not; unseeded flyPos seeds from player.pos. Wiring pins: alt-dup branch byte-identical and BEFORE the orbit claim; MMB claim in the pan handler with top-view pan intact and RMB unclaimed; orbit mousemove branch before editorDragLook; both mouseups clear _edOrbit; _mouseSensNow(false) shared. Three pins moved preserving intent: test-332 (alt-dup-before-look needle), test-429 (LMB claim-line literal; its editorDragPan prefix pin survived unchanged), test-1281 (_mouseSensNow count 4→5). Syntax + boot green; full suite 1109/1109 (baseline+1), zero failures. BUILD_VERSION untouched; no commits; only breach.html + tests/* changed.

RISKS:
Feel is unverifiable headless: the drag direction matches the look drag's angular convention by construction (yaw -= dx·sens), but whether that reads as the expected orbit direction needs one browser drag — the sign flip, if wanted, is one character in _edOrbitMove. First mousemove of an orbit snaps the view to face the pivot when it was not already centred (standard orbit-recentre; a stationary Alt-click moves nothing since only mousemove writes). Holding WASD during a live orbit drag advances flyPos between mousemoves and the next move re-derives the position back onto the captured sphere — a small jump; DCCs do not compose fly+orbit either, and plain WASD outside a drag is untouched. Pivot resolution treats only selProps/selLights (activeSel) as "a selection" — a selected zone/spawn marker falls to the cursor pick (markers are not in groundPointUnderPointer's target list, so the ray lands on the ground beneath them; close, since markers sit on the ground). The pivot for a single selected prop is its origin (selCentroid), not its box centre — for an imported model with an offset origin the orbit centre can sit off the visible mass; the box-union form would need refactoring _edFrameSelected's scratch loop and was not worth the duplication. If the mouse leaves the window mid-drag a missed mouseup can leave _edOrbit live until the next release — identical to the pre-existing editorDragLook behavior, not worsened.
