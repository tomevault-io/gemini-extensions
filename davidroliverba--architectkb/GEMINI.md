# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with this repository.

## Language

All generated text must be in UK English.

## Model Preferences

At the start of each new question thread, ask which Claude model the user would like to use (unless they explicitly specify one). Use this guidance:

- **Haiku**: Fast research, straightforward queries, quick analysis
- **Sonnet**: Balanced for complex tasks, code review, planning
- **Opus**: Deep analysis, complex multi-step tasks, extended reasoning

### Model Selection Guide

Use this rubric for automatic model selection when users don't specify:

| Task Type                                                | Model                              | Rationale                            |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Quick capture (`/daily`, `/meeting`, `/task`, `/person`) | Haiku                              | Speed, low cost, simple templates    |
| Research & exploration (read-only search)                | Haiku subagents                    | Parallel execution, isolated context |
| Document processing (`/pdf-to-page`, `/pptx-to-page`)    | Sonnet                             | Balanced extraction quality          |
| Code review, analysis, summarisation                     | Sonnet                             | Good reasoning, moderate cost        |
| Architecture decisions, ADRs                             | Opus                               | Deep analysis, extended thinking     |
| Complex multi-step orchestration                         | Sonnet coordinator + Haiku workers | Cost-effective parallelism           |
| Vendor evaluation (`/score-rfi`)                         | Sonnet                             | Consistent scoring, parallel agents  |
| Quality reports, audits                                  | Sonnet                             | Comprehensive analysis               |

**Cost Considerations:**

- Haiku: ~$1/$5 per MTok (input/output) - use for high-volume, simple tasks
- Sonnet: ~$3/$15 per MTok - default for most work
- Opus: ~$15/$75 per MTok - reserve for complex reasoning

**Prompt Caching:** For repeated operations, structure prompts with static context first to benefit from 90% cache savings after 2+ requests.

## Task Management

Always use the task list tools to track work items during sessions. For any request involving 2 or more steps, create tasks to track progress. This provides visibility of progress and ensures complex work is properly organised.

### Task Tool Reference

| Tool         | Purpose                                   | When to Use                          |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `TaskCreate` | Create new task with subject, description | Starting any multi-step work         |
| `TaskUpdate` | Update status, add dependencies, modify   | Marking progress, setting blockers   |
| `TaskList`   | View all tasks and their status           | Checking what's pending/blocked      |
| `TaskGet`    | Retrieve full task details by ID          | Getting context before starting work |

### Task Workflow

```
1. TaskCreate - Create tasks for each major step
2. TaskUpdate (addBlockedBy) - Set dependencies between tasks
3. TaskUpdate (status: in_progress) - Mark task as started
4. [Do the work]
5. TaskUpdate (status: completed) - Mark task as done
6. TaskList - Check for next available task
```

### Status Values

- `pending` - Not started, waiting for dependencies
- `in_progress` - Currently being worked on
- `completed` - Successfully finished
- `deleted` - Removed (use sparingly)

### Best Practices

- Use `activeForm` for spinner text (present continuous: "Creating meeting note")
- Set `blockedBy` for tasks that depend on others completing first
- Update status to `in_progress` before starting work
- Always mark tasks `completed` when done (don't leave orphaned tasks)

## Repository Overview

This is an Obsidian vault template designed for **Solutions Architects** to manage professional knowledge effectively. The vault supports architecture decisions, project documentation, meeting notes, research ideas, and personal productivity tracking.

**Key Features:**

- Seven-pillar ontology (Entities, Nodes, Events, Views, Artifacts, Governance, Navigation)
- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) with relationship tracking
- Incubator system for research and idea development
- Quality indicators for content freshness and confidence
- Claude Code skills for automation and AI-assisted workflows

### Knowledge Model: Seven Pillars

The vault is organised around a **node-centric ontology** with seven pillars:

| Pillar         | Nature             | Location          | Purpose                          |
| -------------- | ------------------ | ----------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Entities**   | Things that exist  | Root              | Actors and objects in the world  |
| **Nodes**      | Units of knowledge | Root              | Understanding that persists      |
| **Events**     | Things that happen | Folders           | Temporal occurrences             |
| **Views**      | Aggregated data    | Root              | Reports and dashboards into data |
| **Artifacts**  | External resources | `Attachments/`    | Reference materials collected    |
| **Governance** | Rules & standards  | `Sync/`           | Policies and guardrails          |
| **Navigation** | Finding aids       | Root (`_` prefix) | Help locate content              |

**Core Principle:** _Events happen TO entities and ABOUT nodes. Views aggregate data. Governance constrains decisions. Artifacts provide reference._ Projects end, but knowledge persists.

See **[[Concept - Vault Ontology]]** for the full model.

## Important: This Template is Organisation-Agnostic

**This repository is a generic template designed for any organisation.** It contains NO organisation-specific entries. All examples, text, and guidance use neutral language that works for any architect in any company.

**When contributing to this template, maintain this standard:**

- ❌ **DO NOT add** organisation names, project names, staff names, or system names from any specific organisation
- ✅ **DO use** generic terminology: "your organisation", "your projects", "your team", "your systems"
- ✅ **DO include** customisation guidance so users can adapt the template to their context
- ✅ **DO provide** examples that are illustrative but not tied to any real organisation

**Example:**

- ❌ Bad: "Create ADRs following the Acme Corp ADR process with John Smith as approver"
- ✅ Good: "Create ADRs following your organisation's governance process, adding your required approvers"

## Directory Structure

The vault uses a **pillar-based organisation** where Entities and Nodes live at the root, Events live in folders, and Navigation uses `_` prefix for sorting.

### Note Types by Pillar

Notes are identified by their `type` and `pillar` frontmatter fields. **See `.claude/rules/frontmatter-reference.md` for complete schemas.**

| Pillar         | Types                                                                                         |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Entity**     | Person, System, Organisation, DataAsset, Location                                             |
| **Node**       | Concept, Pattern, Capability, Theme, Weblink                                                  |
| **Event**      | Meeting, Project, Task, ADR, Email, Trip, Daily, Incubator, Workstream, Forum, FormSubmission |
| **View**       | Dashboard, Query, ArchModel                                                                   |
| **Artifact**   | PDF, Presentation, Document, Image (stored in Attachments/)                                   |
| **Governance** | Policy, Guardrail (synced from external sources to Sync/)                                     |
| **Navigation** | MOC                                                                                           |

### Legacy Types (Being Migrated)

| Old Type        | New Type                        | Pillar | Action              |
| --------------- | ------------------------------- | ------ | ------------------- |
| `Page`          | `Concept` / `Pattern` / `Theme` | Node   | Classify by content |
| `DailyNote`     | `Daily`                         | Event  | Rename              |
| `AtomicNote`    | `Concept`                       | Node   | Reclassify          |
| `IncubatorNote` | Part of `Incubator`             | Event  | Merge               |
| `CodeSnippet`   | `Pattern` or archive            | Node   | Case by case        |
| `Course`        | `Incubator` or archive          | Event  | Case by case        |

### Navigation

Use these Maps of Content (MOC) files to navigate:

- **[[_Dashboard - Main Dashboard]]** - Main hub with Dataview queries
- **[[_MOC - Tasks MOC]]** - All tasks by priority/due date
- **[[_MOC - Projects MOC]]** - Projects by status
- **[[_MOC - People MOC]]** - People directory
- **[[_MOC - Meetings MOC]]** - Meeting history
- **[[_MOC - ADRs MOC]]** - Architecture Decision Records
- **[[_MOC - Vault Quality Dashboard]]** - Quality metrics and freshness tracking
- **[[_MOC - Form Submissions]]** - Governance form tracking
- **[[_MOC - Incubator]]** - Idea incubator (research and exploration)

## Frontmatter Schema

All notes use YAML frontmatter with a `type` field. Common properties by type:

### Universal Fields (All Notes)

```yaml
type: <NoteType> # Required - identifies note type
pillar: entity | node | event | view | governance | navigation # Required - identifies pillar
title: <Title> # Required
created: YYYY-MM-DD
modified: YYYY-MM-DD
tags: [] # Hierarchical tags
```

### Relationship Fields (All Content Notes)

All Entities, Nodes, and Events should include relationship fields:

```yaml
nodeRelationships: [] # Links to knowledge nodes
  # - "[[Concept - Data Quality]]"
  # - "[[Pattern - Event-Driven Architecture]]"

entityRelationships: [] # Links to entities
  # - "[[Person - Jane Smith]]"
  # - "[[System - Sample ERP]]"
```

### Tag Syntax

**In frontmatter (no `#`):**

```yaml
tags: [activity/architecture, technology/aws, project/alpha]
```

**Inline in note body (with `#`):**

```markdown
This relates to #technology/aws and #project/alpha work.
```

Obsidian treats both the same way - the `#` is only needed for inline tags in the note body.

### Type-Specific Fields

**Project:**

```yaml
type: Project
status: active | paused | completed # Simple string values
priority: high | medium | low
timeFrame: YYYY-MM-DD - YYYY-MM-DD
collections: <program name>
# Transformation Classification
transformationType: modernisation | migration | greenfield | integration | decommission | uplift | null
transformationScope: enterprise | department | team | application | null
aiInvolved: false # Does project involve AI/ML?
```

**Transformation Types:**
| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `modernisation` | Upgrading existing systems to newer technologies |
| `migration` | Moving systems between platforms (e.g., on-prem to cloud) |
| `greenfield` | Building new capabilities from scratch |
| `integration` | Connecting systems together |
| `decommission` | Retiring legacy systems |
| `uplift` | Security, performance, or compliance improvements |

**Transformation Scope:**
| Scope | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `enterprise` | Organisation-wide impact |
| `department` | Single department or business unit |
| `team` | Single team impact |
| `application` | Single application or service |

**Task:**

```yaml
type: Task
completed: true | false
priority: high | medium | low
doDate: YYYY-MM-DD | null              # When to start working on it
dueBy: YYYY-MM-DD | null               # Hard deadline
project: "[[Project Name]]" | null
assignedTo: ["[[Person Name]]"]        # Array of assignees
parentTask: null                       # "[[Task - Parent]]" (if subtask)
subtasks: []                           # ["[[Task - Child 1]]", "[[Task - Child 2]]"]
```

**Subtask Conventions:**

- Parent tasks list children in `subtasks` array
- Child tasks reference parent in `parentTask` field
- Parent inherits completion status from children (complete when all subtasks complete)
- Children inherit project/priority from parent unless overridden

> **Note:** Legacy notes may use `due` and `assignee` (singular). New notes use `dueBy`, `doDate`, and `assignedTo` (array).

**Meeting:**

```yaml
type: Meeting
date: 'YYYY-MM-DD'
project: "[[Project Name]]" | null
attendees: ["[[Person Name]]"]        # List of attendee links
summary: <brief summary>              # One-line summary
collections: <category>               # e.g., "1:1", "Sprint Planning"
```

> **Note:** Legacy notes may use `peopleInvolved` (string) instead of `attendees` (array).

**Person:**

```yaml
type: Person
role: <job title>
organisation: "[[Org Name]]" | null
emailAddress: '<email>'
```

**Weblink:**

```yaml

### Quality Indicators Pattern

Important notes (ADRs, Pages, Projects) should include quality metadata:

```yaml
# Quality Indicators
confidence: high | medium | low # How authoritative is this?
freshness: current | recent | stale # How up-to-date?
source: primary | secondary | synthesis # Where did info come from?
verified: true | false # Has it been verified?
reviewed: YYYY-MM-DD # Last review date
keywords: [] # Searchable keywords
summary: <brief summary> # One-line summary
```

**Guideline Values:**
| Field | Value | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| `confidence` | `high` | Authoritative, well-researched, definitive |
| `confidence` | `medium` | Good information but some uncertainty |
| `confidence` | `low` | Preliminary, needs verification |
| `freshness` | `current` | Reviewed within 3 months |
| `freshness` | `recent` | Reviewed 3-12 months ago |
| `freshness` | `stale` | Not reviewed in >12 months |
| `source` | `primary` | Created by you, first-hand knowledge |
| `source` | `secondary` | Based on documentation, meetings |
| `source` | `synthesis` | Compiled from multiple sources |

### Relationship Fields Pattern

ADRs and Projects should track relationships to other notes:

```yaml
# Relationships
relatedTo: ["[[Related Note]]"] # Related decisions, projects, context
supersedes: ["[[Old ADR]]"] # ADRs this decision replaces
dependsOn: ["[[Foundation ADR]]"] # ADRs that must exist first
contradicts: ["[[Conflicting ADR]]"] # Known conflicts (rare)
```

**Guidelines:**

- Use empty arrays `[]` if no relationships (don't omit the field)
- Always quote wiki-links in frontmatter YAML
- Keep relationships up-to-date when decisions change

### Archive Fields

When notes are archived using `/archive`, these fields are added:

```yaml
archived: true
archivedDate: YYYY-MM-DD
archivedReason: "<reason for archiving>"
```

Archived notes are moved to `+Archive/<Type>s/` folder.

## Incubator System

The Incubator is a dedicated space for exploring ideas before committing to formal projects or ADRs.

### Incubator Lifecycle

| Status      | Description                            |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `seed`      | Initial idea capture, minimal research |
| `exploring` | Active research and investigation      |
| `validated` | Research complete, ready for decision  |
| `accepted`  | Graduated to Project, ADR, or Page     |
| `rejected`  | Decided not to pursue                  |

### Incubator Domains

Use these controlled domain values:

- `architecture` - Architecture patterns and approaches
- `governance` - Governance processes and standards
- `tooling` - Tools and developer experience
- `security` - Security patterns and compliance
- `data` - Data architecture and management
- `documentation` - Documentation approaches
- `process` - Process improvements
- `ai` - AI and automation opportunities
- `infrastructure` - Infrastructure patterns

### Incubator Commands

| Command                             | Description                                  |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `incubator <title>`                 | Create new idea (no prompts)                 |
| `incubator <title> [domain]`        | Create with domain keywords                  |
| `incubator note <title> for <idea>` | Create research note                         |
| `incubator list [filter]`           | List active ideas by status or domain        |
| `incubator list all`                | Include archived (graduated/rejected)        |
| `incubator status <idea> <status>`  | Update lifecycle status                      |
| `incubator graduate <idea>`         | Graduate to Project/ADR/Page (archives idea) |
| `incubator reject <idea>`           | Reject with reason (archives idea)           |

## Archive System

The Archive provides soft-deletion for completed or abandoned notes while preserving backlinks.

### When to Archive

- Incubator ideas that are graduated or rejected
- Projects that are completed or cancelled
- Tasks that are done or no longer relevant
- People who have left the organisation
- Pages that are superseded by newer content

### Archive Process

1. Use `/archive <note>` command
2. Claude adds archive metadata to frontmatter
3. Note is moved to `+Archive/<Type>s/` folder
4. Backlinks remain intact for reference

### Archive Structure

Archived notes are organised by pillar:

```
Archive/
├── Entities/    # Archived people, systems, organisations
├── Nodes/       # Archived concepts, patterns, weblinks
└── Events/      # Archived projects, tasks, incubator ideas
```

## Custom Skills

User-invocable skills are defined in `.claude/skills/`. When the user invokes a skill, read the corresponding file for instructions.

**Usage**: These are instruction files, not registered Claude Code commands. When the user types a skill command (e.g., `/meeting`) or asks naturally (e.g., "create a meeting note"), read `.claude/skills/<skill>.md` and follow its instructions. Skills marked "uses sub-agents" should launch parallel Task agents for efficiency.

**Note**: Skills work by the assistant reading and executing the instructions - they won't appear in Claude Code's built-in `/` command list.

## MCP Server Integrations

This vault can connect to MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers for extended capabilities.

### Configuring MCP Servers

Add servers to `.mcp.json` in your vault root:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "server-name": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@modelcontextprotocol/server-name"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Common MCP Servers

| Server       | Purpose                          | Installation                            |
| ------------ | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **GitHub**   | PR, issue, repo management       | `@modelcontextprotocol/server-github`   |
| **Postgres** | Database queries                 | `@modelcontextprotocol/server-postgres` |
| **Notion**   | Sync with Notion databases/pages | Configure with Notion integration token |
| **Diagrams** | Generate architecture diagrams   | Enables diagram generation via Python   |

### MCP Best Practices

- Use `mcp-find` to discover available servers in the catalog
- Use `mcp-add` to enable a server for the session
- MCP tools are NOT available in background subagents
- Check server documentation for required configuration

## Dynamic Context Loading

Additional context files are available in `.claude/context/` to provide deeper domain knowledge without bloating the main context. **Load these files as needed based on user queries:**

| File                        | Load When User Asks About               |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `projects-template.md`      | Specific project details and status     |
| `technology-template.md`    | Technical systems, platforms, and tools |
| `people-template.md`        | People, teams, stakeholders             |
| `acronyms-template.md`      | Unknown abbreviations and terminology   |
| `architecture-template.md`  | ADRs, patterns, governance, compliance  |
| `organisations-template.md` | External companies and vendors          |

**Usage**: When a query involves specific domain knowledge, read the relevant context file(s) first:

```
Read .claude/context/projects-template.md   # For project-specific queries
Read .claude/context/acronyms-template.md   # When encountering unknown terms
```

**Customisation**: These template files should be renamed (remove `-template` suffix) and populated with your organisation's specific information.

## Modular Rules

Detailed reference documentation is split into focused files in `.claude/rules/`:

| File                       | Purpose                                                      |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `frontmatter-reference.md` | Quick reference for all frontmatter fields by type           |
| `naming-conventions.md`    | File and folder naming patterns                              |
| `quality-patterns.md`      | Quality indicators, relationships, and tag taxonomy          |
| `tag-taxonomy.md`          | Comprehensive hierarchical tag taxonomy and validation rules |

These provide deeper detail than this main file - load when working on specific conventions.

## Sensitive Information Warning

Notes with `classification: secret` or `classification: confidential` may contain API keys, tokens, passwords, and credentials. **AI assistants should NEVER expose, copy, or transmit this sensitive information.**

## Search Strategy

**IMPORTANT:** This vault has a pre-computed knowledge graph index with **BM25 relevance ranking**. Always query the graph BEFORE using Grep or find commands.

### Graph-First Search Order

1. **First: Query the graph index** (fast, ranked results)

   ```bash
   node scripts/graph-query.js --search "<term>"      # BM25 ranked search
   node scripts/graph-query.js --type <Type>          # Filter by type
   node scripts/graph-query.js --type Adr --status proposed  # Combined filters
   node scripts/graph-query.js --backlinks "<Note>"   # Find references
   ```

   Search results are ranked by BM25 relevance score - top results are most relevant.

2. **Second: Use Grep** (only if graph doesn't have needed data)
   - For content not in frontmatter
   - For regex patterns
   - For specific line content

3. **Third: Use Glob** (for file patterns only)
   - When you need specific file paths
   - When searching by filename pattern

### Common Graph Queries

| Need                | Graph Command                                                   |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Find all ADRs       | `node scripts/graph-query.js --type Adr`                        |
| Active projects     | `node scripts/graph-query.js --type Project --status active`    |
| High priority tasks | `node scripts/graph-query.js --type Task --priority high`       |
| Search for "kafka"  | `node scripts/graph-query.js --search kafka`                    |
| Orphaned notes      | `node scripts/graph-query.js --orphans`                         |
| Broken links        | `node scripts/graph-query.js --broken-links`                    |
| Notes linking to X  | `node scripts/graph-query.js --backlinks "Project - MyProject"` |
| Vault statistics    | `node scripts/graph-query.js --stats`                           |

### When to Skip the Graph

- Searching inside code blocks or specific text patterns
- Looking for content changes (use `git log -p`)
- File operations (use Glob directly)

## Working with This Vault

### Linking Conventions

- Internal links use Obsidian wiki-link syntax: `[[Note Title]]`
- Cross-references between notes create a knowledge graph (use backlinks)
- Status/priority values use simple strings: `active`, `high`, `medium`, `low`

### Creating/Editing Notes

1. Always include YAML frontmatter with `type` and `pillar` fields
2. Include `nodeRelationships` and `entityRelationships` for content notes
3. **Entities and Nodes** go in root with type prefix: `Person - Name.md`, `Concept - Title.md`
4. **Events** go in folders: `Meetings/YYYY/`, `Projects/`, `Tasks/`, `ADRs/`, `Daily/YYYY/`, etc.
5. **Navigation** uses `_` prefix: `_MOC - Scope.md`
6. Place attachments in **Attachments/** folder
7. Use `/archive` to move notes to **Archive/<Pillar>/** folder (Entities, Nodes, Events)
8. Use `[[wiki-links]]` for cross-references to other notes
9. Daily notes follow `Daily - YYYY-MM-DD.md` naming convention
10. Meeting notes follow `Meeting - YYYY-MM-DD Title.md` naming convention
11. Include `created` and `modified` date fields

**See `.claude/rules/naming-conventions.md` for complete patterns.**

| ---- | --------------------- | -------------------- |
| MOC  | `_MOC - {{Scope}}.md` | `_MOC - Projects.md` |

**Note**: All notes now use type prefixes. Use aliases in frontmatter for shorter wiki-links: `aliases: [Jane Smith]` allows `[[Jane Smith]]` to resolve to `Person - Jane Smith.md`.

### Finding Notes

Use Dataview queries or the MOC files to find notes by type:

```dataview
TABLE title, status, priority
FROM ""
WHERE type = "Task" AND completed = false
SORT priority ASC
```

The vault can sync between desktop and mobile via Git and/or Obsidian Sync.

| `analyze_structure.js`    | Comprehensive vault structure analysis                                  |

Run Python scripts with `python3 scripts/<script>.py [arguments]` and Node.js scripts with `node scripts/<script>.js [arguments]`. Most Python scripts support `--dry-run` flag to preview changes.

## Getting Started

### Initial Setup

1. **Clone or fork this template repository**
2. **Open the vault in Obsidian**
3. **Enable required plugins:**
   - Dataview (for queries and MOCs)
   - Templater (for note templates)
   - Calendar (optional, for daily notes)

### Customisation Steps

1. **Rename context files** - Remove `-template` suffix from files in `.claude/context/`
2. **Populate context files** - Add your organisation's projects, people, technology stack
3. **Update Organisation notes** - Replace example organisations with your vendors/partners
4. **Review templates** - Customise templates in `+Templates/` for your workflow
5. **Set up sync** - Configure Git and/or Obsidian Sync for backup

### Recommended First Steps

1. Create a daily note with `/daily`
2. Add a few Person notes for key colleagues
3. Create your first Project note
4. Try the `/adr` skill to create an Architecture Decision Record
5. Explore the MOC files to understand navigation

## Autonomous Workflows

Claude Code supports autonomous operation modes for reduced prompting and extended sessions.

### Plan Mode

Activate with `Shift+Tab` (twice from Normal Mode) to enter read-only exploration:

- **Indicator:** `⏸` in prompt
- **Behaviour:** Read-only operations, no file modifications
- **Use for:** Research, understanding code, planning changes
- **Exit:** Use `ExitPlanMode` tool when plan is ready for approval

### Workflow: Explore → Plan → Code → Commit

1. **Explore** - Have Claude read files without coding (use Explore subagent)
2. **Plan** - Request detailed implementation plan (use "think hard" for extended reasoning)
3. **Code** - Implement the solution with verification
4. **Commit** - Request commit and PR creation

### Context Management

- **Auto-compaction:** Triggers at 95% context capacity
- **Manual compaction:** Use `/compact` between phases
- **Session wipe:** Use `/wipe` to generate handoff and start fresh
- **Autonomous duration:** ~10-20 minutes before context fills

### Sub-Agent Patterns

Launch parallel subagents for independent research:

```
Task tool with:
- subagent_type: "Explore" - Fast, read-only (Haiku)
- subagent_type: "general-purpose" - Full capabilities
- subagent_type: "Plan" - Research for planning
- run_in_background: true - Non-blocking execution
```

### Permission Modes

| Mode          | Behaviour                    |
| ------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `default`     | Standard permission checking |
| `acceptEdits` | Auto-accept file edits       |
| `plan`        | Read-only exploration        |

Configure permissions in `.claude/settings.json` or via Claude Code settings.
