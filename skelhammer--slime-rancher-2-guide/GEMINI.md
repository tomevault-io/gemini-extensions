This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Workflow for AI Assistants

### Initial Session Protocol

**REQUIRED:** At the start of every new session working with this repository, follow this protocol:

1. **Read README.md** - Understand the guide structure, navigation, and current version
2. **Read CLAUDE.md** (this file) - Review editing conventions and repository structure
3. **Read CHANGELOG.md** - Review recent changes to understand what's been updated

**Why this matters:**

- README.md provides the current version number and guide overview
- CLAUDE.md contains critical editing instructions and style guidelines
- CHANGELOG.md shows what's changed recently to avoid redundant work

### Making Changes Workflow

When the user requests changes to the guide, follow this workflow:

#### Step 1: Identify Target File(s)

- **Chapter content**: Edit specific chapter file (e.g., `01-chapter-01.md`, `03-chapter-09.md`)
- **Core mechanics**: Edit `00-introduction.md`
- **Reference tables**: Edit appropriate appendix (`appendix-a-slimes.md`, `appendix-b-items.md`, etc.)
- **Ranch progression**: Edit `appendix-l-plot-overview.md` (treat changes here as main guide content — version + CHANGELOG update required)
- **Navigation/meta**: Edit `README.md`
- **New chapter / new CHANGELOG entry**: start from `.templates/chapter-template.md` or `.templates/changelog-entry-template.md`

#### Step 2: Make Content Edits

- Follow the [Writing Style](#writing-style) guidelines below
- Maintain consistent formatting with existing content
- Use tables for comparative data in appendices
- Include warning callouts for critical information

#### Step 3: Update Version Information

**If content was changed** (not just typo fixes):

1. Update `00-introduction.md` version header:
   - Increment version number (0.1 → 0.2)
   - Update "Last Updated" date to current date
   - Create a descriptive version name (e.g., "Saber Strategies Edition")
2. Do NOT update version in individual chapter files - it only lives in `00-introduction.md`

#### Step 4: Update CHANGELOG.md

**REQUIRED for ALL content changes:**

1. Add a new version section at the top of CHANGELOG.md
2. Document what was changed:
   - New content added
   - Corrections made
   - Updates to existing strategies
   - Files modified
3. Use the existing format as a template
4. Be specific about what changed (not just "updated Chapter 5")

**Example CHANGELOG entry:**

```markdown
## [0.2] - 2025-10-25 - Saber Strategies Edition

### Changed
- **Chapter 7** (02-chapter-07.md): Updated Saber Slime acquisition strategy
  - Added alternate route through northern passage
  - Corrected Thundercluck spawn location
- **Appendix A** (appendix-a-slimes.md): Fixed Saber Slime favorite food

### Fixed
- Corrected markdown link in Chapter 7 to appendix-a-slimes.md
```

#### Step 5: Update the mirror files (if version changed)

If you updated the version in Step 3, also update the header in each of the sanctioned mirror files so they stay in sync with `00-introduction.md`:

- `README.md` — version header at the top (only spot; bottom Version Information section is version-free)
- `steam/SECTION-01-INTRO.txt` — version header at the top (BBCode)
- `steam/SECTION-18-APPENDICES-2.txt` — version footer line at the bottom (BBCode; this is Part 2 of the split appendices section)

The `version-sync.yml` CI job will fail if any file outside this list (plus `CHANGELOG.md`) hardcodes a `Version 0.X` string.

### Quality Checks

Before considering changes complete, verify:

1. **Link Integrity**: Do all markdown links still work?
   - Chapter-to-chapter references
   - Chapter-to-appendix references
   - README navigation links

2. **Cross-Reference Validation**:
   - If you changed appendix data (slime stats, prices, locations), check if chapters reference that data
   - If you changed chapter content, verify appendix-l-plot-overview.md still matches
   - Ensure consistency between related sections

3. **Formatting Consistency**:
   - Tables are properly formatted with aligned columns
   - Bold/italic formatting matches style guide
   - Heading hierarchy is correct (##, ###, ####)
   - Code blocks and callouts are properly formatted

4. **Data Accuracy**:
   - Numbers and statistics are consistent across files
   - Largo combinations make sense (correct slime pairings)
   - Revenue calculations match the plotted corrals

### Git and Version Control

**CRITICAL RULES - READ CAREFULLY:**

- **NEVER commit or push changes automatically** - ONLY commit/push when the user EXPLICITLY asks you to
- **DO NOT commit after making edits** - Just make the edits and STOP
- **DO NOT push after committing** - Only push when explicitly requested
- The user will tell you when they want changes committed and pushed
- Never use `git add .` - be selective about what files to stage
- When committing (only when asked), use descriptive messages that reference version numbers
- Example: `git commit -m "v0.2 - Saber Strategies Edition: Update Chapter 7 and Appendix A"`

**The user has repeatedly asked you to stop auto-committing. Follow this rule without exception.**

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Forgetting to update CHANGELOG.md** - This is required for all content changes
2. **Updating version in wrong place** - Only update in `00-introduction.md`, not individual chapters
3. **Breaking markdown links** - Always verify links after moving or renaming content
4. **Inconsistent formatting** - Match existing table and bullet point styles
5. **Skipping the initial read protocol** - Always read README, CLAUDE, and CHANGELOG first
6. **Not updating README.md version** - If you bump version, update it in README too

### When to Ask Questions

Ask the user for clarification when:

- The change might affect multiple interconnected files
- You're unsure which version name to use
- The requested change conflicts with existing content
- You need to verify game mechanics or prices
- Multiple valid approaches exist for implementing the change

## Repository Overview

This is a documentation repository containing a comprehensive walkthrough guide for Slime Rancher 2, a farming simulator video game.

**For complete repository structure and file organization, see [README.md](README.md).**

## File Organization Quick Reference

- **Chapter Files:** `01-chapter-01.md` through `04-chapter-15.md` (organized by part number prefix)
- **Core Files:** `00-introduction.md` (with version header), `README.md`
- **Appendices:** `appendix-a-slimes.md`, `appendix-b-items.md`, `appendix-c-upgrades.md`, `appendix-d-ranch.md`, `appendix-e-gadgets.md`, `appendix-f-drones.md`, `appendix-g-treasure.md`, `appendix-h-map.md`, `appendix-i-doors.md`, `appendix-j-shadow.md`, `appendix-k-resources.md`, `appendix-l-plot-overview.md`, `appendix-m-teleporters.md`
- **Book site (mdBook):** `book.toml` (config) and `SUMMARY.md` (site TOC / chapter ordering) at repo root. Any time a chapter or appendix file is added, renamed, or reordered, `SUMMARY.md` must be updated to match — it drives the left-sidebar TOC and the next/prev buttons on [skelhammer.github.io/slime-rancher-2-guide](https://skelhammer.github.io/slime-rancher-2-guide/). The `pages.yml` workflow rebuilds the site on every push to `main`.

**See [README.md](README.md) for complete chapter listings and navigation.**

## Writing Style

**For guide philosophy and writing style, see the "Guide Philosophy" and "How to Use This Guide" sections in [README.md](README.md).**

Key formatting standards:

- **Directive, strategic tone**: Frames gameplay as resource management and capital deployment
- **Tables for comparative data**: Plot layouts, upgrade costs, resource comparisons
- **Bold for CRITICAL warnings**: Tarr risks, mandatory upgrades, time-sensitive mechanics
- **Consistent formatting**: Match existing chapter structure (see Step 1 in workflow above)

## Version Information

The current version, last-updated date, and verification status live **exclusively** in `00-introduction.md`. Do NOT duplicate them here or in individual chapter/appendix files. The `README.md` version header, `steam/SECTION-01-INTRO.txt`, and the footer of `steam/SECTION-18-APPENDICES-2.txt` are mirrors that must be kept in sync with `00-introduction.md` — everything else should be version-free.

A CI job (`.github/workflows/version-sync.yml`) enforces this by failing on any hardcoded `Version 0.X` string outside the sanctioned mirror files.

**Version Numbering Scheme:**

- Increment version number for each update (0.1 → 0.2 → 0.3, etc.)
- Give each version a fun, descriptive name based on what changed
- Examples: "The Price is Right Edition" (price fixes), "Largo Optimization Edition" (new combos), "Spring Cleaning Edition" (reorganization)

**Version Header Format (for `00-introduction.md`):**

```markdown
#### Version 0.XX - Descriptive Name Edition

**Last Updated: Month Day, Year**
```

For the step-by-step version update workflow, see **Step 3** and **Step 5** of the Making Changes Workflow above.
