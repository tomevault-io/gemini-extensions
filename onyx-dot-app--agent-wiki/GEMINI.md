CRITICAL: When starting new work, make sure to check the wiki for relevant documentation and update accordingly.
As you make progress, make sure to periodically update the wiki so that nothing is inconsistent with the code base.

## Stack at a glance

- **Backend** — FastAPI (uvicorn) + Postgres 17 (with `pg_textsearch` for BM25 search and `pgmq` for the task queue) + custom workers. Git is shelled out to.
- **Frontend** — Next.js 14 (App Router) + TypeScript.
- **Nginx** in front, reverse-proxying `/api/*` → backend, everything else → frontend.
- App state and queues both live in Postgres (connection via `DATABASE_URL`). Wiki working tree on volume `wiki-data`.

See `docs/architecture.md` for the data flows.

## Pre-commit hooks

**Run `pre-commit install` once after cloning** — every commit then runs the
same checks CI runs on PRs, so type or lint failures surface locally before
they hit a review. Hook config lives in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`. Run
`pre-commit run --all-files` ad-hoc to lint the whole tree.

What runs on backend Python files:

- **ruff** (`backend/pyproject.toml [tool.ruff]`) — fast lint.
- **basedpyright** (`backend/pyproject.toml [tool.basedpyright]`, strict mode)
  — type check. Runs whole-project on any backend `.py` change because it
  needs the import graph; passing only the changed files would miss
  cross-file errors.

Both hooks resolve their version via `uv run --project backend --extra dev`
so the pre-commit run uses the exact same tools as `uv sync --extra dev`.
Make sure you've run `uv sync --extra dev` in `backend/` first.

Add new checks as hooks here, not as one-off CI steps.

## Architectural rules — required interfaces and seams

These exist so the system stays testable and swappable. Honor them.

### LLM calls — always through `app/llm/client.py`

`stream(messages, ...)` and `complete(messages, ...)` (a drainer) in
`app/llm/client.py` are the **only** allowed entry points for talking to a
model. They yield/return a normalized shape (`text_delta`/`tool_call`/`done`
events; `{text, tool_calls, stop_reason, usage}` dicts) so callers don't
branch on provider.

Provider implementations live as a plural seam under `app/llm/providers/`:
one module per backend (`anthropic.py`, `openai.py`, `gemini.py`, `ollama.py`),
each exposing a module-level `PROVIDER` satisfying the `Provider` protocol
(`name`, `check_configured(settings)`, `stream(messages, *, model, tools,
max_tokens, settings)`).

- Do **not** `import anthropic`, `import openai`, `from google import genai`,
  or `import ollama` outside the matching `app/llm/providers/<name>.py` module.
- Provider, model, and credentials come from `app/llm/settings.py:get()`
  (DB-backed, configured via the admin page). Don't read provider keys from
  `CONFIG` or `os.environ` anywhere else.
- Add a new provider by dropping `app/llm/providers/<name>.py` with a
  `PROVIDER` instance and importing+registering it from
  `app/llm/providers/__init__.py`. Don't add if/elif branches in `client.py`.
- In tests, patch `app.llm.client.stream`/`complete` for caller-level tests,
  or the per-provider `_client` for SDK-shape tests. Never import the real
  provider SDKs in tests.

### Auth — `Depends(...)`, not raw session reads

In API code, gate routes with `Depends(require_user)` or
`Depends(require_admin)` from `app.auth.deps`. The dependency
function returns a typed `User`; bind it on the route signature and
pass it down (e.g. to `require_can(action, path, user)`). For
non-HTTP code paths (worker tasks, agent tools), read the active
user with `app.auth.current_user()` — it reads the ContextVar bound
by ``app.auth.deps.CurrentUserMiddleware`` for HTTP requests or by
``set_current_user(user)`` for background tasks. Don't touch
`request.session["user_id"]` outside `app/api/auth.py`.

- Public endpoints (signup, login, `/auth/config`, inbound webhooks)
  are explicit — everything else takes a `Depends(require_user)`
  parameter.
- The first registered user is auto-admin (`users_repo.create` checks
  `count() == 0`). Admin can't be left at zero (see `app/api/admin.py`
  — demote/delete guard against `admin_count() <= 1`).
- The session cookie is signed by Starlette's ``SessionMiddleware``
  (installed in ``app/main.py:create_app``); ``app.auth.deps.current_user``
  reads ``request.session["user_id"]``.

### Wiki page authorization — `require_can` + `app/wiki/acl.py`

Per-page permissions live in Postgres (`acl_entries`, `wiki_owners`,
`groups`, `group_members`). Routes that read or mutate a wiki page
must gate via `app.auth.require_can("read"|"write", path, user)`
where ``user`` is the value resolved by ``Depends(require_user)``.
Search and listing endpoints filter through
`app.wiki.acl.visible_paths_filter` (SQL predicate) or
`acl.filter_paths_in_python` (in-memory).

- New pages get default-public ACL rows + an owner stamp via the
  lifecycle hook in `app.wiki.notify.after_doc_write` — call that helper
  with `change_kind="create"` and pass `owner_user_id`.
- Don't read/write `acl_entries` or `wiki_owners` directly from routers
  or agent tools — go through `app.wiki.acl` (`grant`, `revoke`,
  `set_owner`, `effective`, `visible_paths_filter`).
- Group membership goes through `app.auth.groups` (CRUD + lookup).
- Permission rows are **Postgres-only** — they are not committed to the
  wiki repo or stored on the `wiki-data` volume. See
  `local_data/wiki/permissions/permissions.md` and the export warning in
  `local_data/wiki/running-locally.md`.

### Database — SQLAlchemy 2.0 ORM, small repo modules

Schema lives in `app/db/models.py` as `DeclarativeBase` subclasses with
`Mapped[T]` / `mapped_column()`. Repos are small free-function modules
(`app/auth/users.py` is the canonical example) that go through the ORM
session.

- **Connection seam**: `app/db/session.py` exposes `session()` (a context
  manager that commits on clean exit, rolls back on exception) and
  `init_db()`. Every repo opens its own session per call. Don't share a
  session across unrelated work in a request.
- **Repos return dicts**, not ORM objects, so the rest of the app
  doesn't depend on SQLAlchemy. `User`, `Trigger`, etc. are DB-shape
  declarations, not the data type returned by the API. Pydantic models
  in `app/models/` are for HTTP shapes — keep those separate from the
  ORM layer.
- One repo module per logical aggregate (`users`, `documents`,
  `triggers`, …). New schema = edit `app/db/models.py` and generate a
  migration: `cd backend && alembic revision --autogenerate -m
  "<short slug>"`. The new file lands in
  `app/db/migrations/versions/`; review it (autogenerate doesn't see
  every kind of change) and commit. `init_db()` runs `alembic upgrade
  head` on every boot so deploys apply pending migrations
  automatically. The bootstrap migration `0001_initial` materializes
  the entire current schema via `Base.metadata.create_all` and seeds
  the catalog rows the app expects (e.g. `trigger_destinations`).
  Everything after it should be an explicit `op.alter_table` /
  `op.add_column` diff.
- **Raw SQL is allowed only for things the ORM can't express** — today
  that means pg_textsearch's `<@>` operator + `to_bm25query()` (in
  `app/db/fts.py`) and pgmq's `pgmq.send/read/delete/archive` (in
  `app/tasks/queue.py`). Both go through `session.execute(text(...))`.
  Don't add new raw-SQL sites elsewhere — write the model expression
  instead.
- **Tests**: shared seed/inspection helpers live in `tests/_seed.py`
  (`seed_user`, `seed_trigger`, `insert_event`, `list_events`,
  `list_fts_rows`, `count_rows`, `clear_events`). They use the ORM
  session under the hood; tests should reach for them rather than
  hand-writing SQL.

### Data classes — pydantic, not `@dataclass`

Use `pydantic.BaseModel` for any new structured class — config blocks,
settings, value objects, internal records. Don't use `@dataclass` /
`dataclasses.field` anywhere. Pydantic gives us validation, `model_copy`,
`model_dump`, and a single mental model that matches the HTTP-shape
classes in `app/models/`.

- Frozen value objects: `model_config = ConfigDict(frozen=True)`.
- Default factories: `Field(default_factory=...)`.
- `dataclasses.replace(obj, x=1)` → `obj.model_copy(update={"x": 1})`.
- Field names can't start with `_` — use a public name (or `PrivateAttr`
  if it's truly internal).

### LLM tracing — `app/tracing/`, never instrument inline

Every LLM exchange and tool dispatch is already wrapped at the
chokepoint (`app/llm/client.py:stream` and
`app/llm/agents/chat.py:_drive_loop`). Anything new that calls
`client.stream` / `client.complete` picks up an `llm:<provider>`
span automatically; tool dispatch through the chat loop picks up
`tool:<name>` spans automatically.

For a new top-level flow (a new agent, a new background task, a new
API handler that drives the LLM), wrap its entry point:

```python
from app.tracing import trace_flow
with trace_flow("agent.my_thing", user_id=user_id, ...):
    ...
```

That's the whole API. Don't reach for `start_llm_span` /
`start_tool_span` directly — they're already wired at the seams.
Don't `import braintrust` outside `app/tracing/braintrust.py`.

Config (project, API key, enabled flag) is admin-managed at
`/admin/braintrust`. No env-var fallback. See
`local_data/wiki/observability/braintrust-tracing.md`.

### Wiki edits — through `app/wiki/git.py`

Never `subprocess.run(["git", ...])` from anywhere else. The wrapper enforces
working dir, identity, and commit-on-write. Path validation goes through
`app/wiki/filesystem.py:safe_rel_path` to block traversal.

- For any user/agent write to the wiki: `commit_file()`, then enqueue
  `tasks.reindex.reindex_document`. The web request shouldn't index inline.

### Background work — pgmq queues, not threads

If something might take more than ~100ms, queue it. Tasks live under
`app/tasks/` and bind to one of three `TaskQueue` instances in
`app/tasks/queues.py` — `documents_queue` (LLM doc-reconciliation),
`triggers_queue` (NL trigger eval, delta + scheduled), or
`lightweight_maintenance_queue` (sub-second upkeep — BM25 reindex,
agent-activity expiration cleanup). Each queue's messages live in
`pgmq.q_<name>` in the same Postgres as app state; the abstraction
itself is in `app/tasks/queue.py`. Each queue has its own worker
process (`python -m app.tasks.run_worker <queue>`); make sure new
task modules are imported by `run_worker.py` so they register on
boot. The variable names and the `queues.py` filename are kept
from the TaskQueue era so call sites didn't have to change.

The placement rule for `lightweight_maintenance_queue`: handlers must
be sub-second, no LLM, no external HTTP, no wiki commits. Anything
slower belongs on its own queue — that's the contract that lets us
run wider concurrency on this one without a slow task starving the
others.

**For all the detail — queue rationale, routing rules, run commands,
docker / launch.json wiring, what breaks if a worker isn't running —
see `local_data/wiki/background-tasks/background-tasks.md`.** Don't
duplicate that doc; update it.

### Logging — `app.utils.logging.setup_logging` once per process

Module code uses standard `log = logging.getLogger(__name__)` and emits at
`debug/info/warning/error/exception` levels. Process entry points
(`app/main.py:create_app`, `app/tasks/run_worker.py:main`) call
`setup_logging()` exactly once to install the formatter on the root logger.

- Format: `<ts> [<level>] <logger> (<file>:<line>): <msg>` — level is
  controlled by the `LOG_LEVEL` env var (default `INFO`).
- Don't `print()` from app code; don't call `logging.basicConfig` anywhere
  outside `setup_logging`.
- Use `log.exception(...)` inside `except` blocks to capture the traceback.
- Set `LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` to dump full LLM message history, tool definitions,
  tool calls, and tool results untruncated. Hot-path serialization is gated
  behind `log.isEnabledFor(DEBUG)`, so leaving it at INFO has no cost.

### Triggers — git-backed, Postgres is a cache

The source of truth for a trigger is its YAML file in the wiki repo, sitting
inline next to the scope it acts on:

- doc-scoped: `<dir>/.trigger_<id>_<docbase>.yaml` next to the doc
- folder-scoped: `<dir>/.trigger_<id>.yaml` inside the folder

The `triggers` row in Postgres (including `file_path`) is a denormalized
cache for fast fan-out lookup and id→path resolution. When mutating
triggers, write/delete the file first via `app/triggers/storage.py`, then
upsert/delete the row, in the same task. `app/triggers/repo.py:rebuild_from_filesystem`
re-converges the cache by walking tracked `.trigger_*.yaml` paths.

### HTTP API — routers stay thin

`APIRouter`s in `app/api/` parse the request, call into a domain module,
and serialize the result. Business logic lives in `app/auth/`,
`app/wiki/`, `app/triggers/`, `app/llm/agents/`. If you find yourself
doing a multi-step workflow inside a route handler, push it down.

Error responses use `{"error": "<message>"}` with the right status
code — domain exceptions (``HTTPException``, ``PermissionDenied``,
``RequestError``, ``QueueFullError``) are translated by the handlers
installed in `app/main.py:_install_error_handlers`. The frontend's
`ApiError` parses this shape.

## Frontend rules

### Every change considers light mode, dark mode, and responsiveness

Before declaring a frontend change done, verify it in **both themes** and at
**both viewport sizes**. The app supports light and dark mode (toggled via
`data-theme` on `<html>`; tokens live in `src/lib/theme.ts` + `globals.css`)
and a mobile breakpoint (`useIsMobile()` from `src/lib/viewport.ts`).

- Don't introduce raw hex/rgb/named colors — always go through `color.*` /
  `shadow.*` from `src/lib/theme.ts`. New shades must be added to both
  `:root` and `:root[data-theme="dark"]` in `globals.css`.
- Don't use `background: "white"` (or any literal) — use `color.bg.page`.
- Bare `<input>` / `<textarea>` / `<select>` inherit themed defaults from
  `globals.css`; keep them themed when overriding.
- Layouts must hold up at the mobile breakpoint — gate dense desktop
  chrome with `isMobile`, and avoid hardcoded widths that overflow
  narrow viewports.

### Network — only via `src/lib/api.ts:apiFetch`

`apiFetch<T>(path, init?)` sets `credentials: "include"`, JSON content type,
and parses the `{error}` envelope into `ApiError` with a `.status`. Don't
call `fetch` directly.

### Auth — only via `src/lib/auth.tsx`

Pages call `useRequireAuth()` to gate, `useAuth()` to read state. Don't
call `/api/auth/me` from a component — let the provider own that. New auth
flows (e.g. password reset) extend the context, not the pages.

### Shared chrome — `<AppShell>`

Top-level pages wrap their content in `AppShell` (in
`src/components/common/`). Navigation, the user badge, and sign-out live
there.

### Markdown

Use `react-markdown` + `remark-gfm` (already wired in the wiki page). Don't
inject HTML from the backend.

### Design tokens — only via `src/lib/theme.ts`

The frontend has no Tailwind / CSS-in-JS — components style themselves with
inline `style={{...}}`. Centralized tokens live in `src/lib/theme.ts` and
are the **only** source of color, radius, and shadow values:

- `color.text` — `primary | secondary | muted | faint | inverse`
- `color.bg` — `page | panel | sunken | hover | active`
- `color.border` — `subtle | default | strong | focus`
- `color.accent` — primary action surface (`bg`, `bgHover`, `fg`) + subtle
  variants (`subtleBg`, `subtleFg`, `subtleBorder`) for selected rows /
  badges / hover-active states
- `color.state` — `success | warning | danger | info`, each with
  `{ bg, border, fg }` for banners, alerts, semantic chips
- `color.overlay` — fixed warm-near-black tint for modal scrims
- `radius` — `xs (4) | sm (6) | md (8) | lg (12) | pill (9999)`
- `shadow` — `sm | md | popover | fab | modal | panel`

**Rules:**

- Don't write a raw hex (`#xxxxxx`) in a component. If the shade you need
  isn't in `theme.ts`, add it there (with a name that describes intent, not
  appearance — `accent.bg` not `nearBlack`) and import it.
- The accent color is **near-black warm grey**, not a hue. Primary buttons,
  selected sidebar avatars, FABs, and active text all flow from
  `color.accent`. If you find yourself reaching for blue/indigo/purple to
  mark "primary," use the accent instead.
- Status colors (`color.state.*`) are reserved for semantic signals
  (banners, error toasts, "destructive" buttons). Don't use them as
  decorative chips — use `color.accent.subtle*` for that.
- Pick a radius from the scale; don't sprinkle arbitrary integers. Inputs
  / pills inside dense rows = `xs`. Buttons / inputs / list items = `sm`.
  Cards / popovers / modals = `md`–`lg`.
- Decorative SVG icon glyphs (e.g. the amber folder, the blue file icon)
  are the only place raw hex is acceptable — they're illustrations, not UI
  surfaces. Don't extend that exception to anything that paints chrome.

### Buttons — only via `<Button>` from `src/components/common/Button.tsx`

There's one button component, four variants, two sizes:

- `variant="primary"` — accent surface; one per row at most (form submit,
  primary CTA in a header)
- `variant="secondary"` (default) — neutral with subtle border; the
  workhorse
- `variant="danger"` — destructive (Revoke, Delete); uses `state.danger`
- `variant="ghost"` — transparent surface for low-emphasis text actions
- `size="md"` (default) — forms, modal actions, page headers
- `size="sm"` — dense rows, table cells, inline actions

Don't write ad-hoc `<button style={{ ... }}>` for primary/secondary/danger
chrome. If you need an unusual one-off (icon-only toolbar buttons in
`AppShell` / `ChatWidget`, the wiki row hover actions), keep them inline
but pull every color/radius from the theme — never raw hex.

### Modals — fixed scrim and shadow

All modal-style dialogs (`TriggerModal`, `TriggerHistoryModal`,
`RunAgentModal`, `ShareDialog`) use:

- scrim: `color.overlay` (warm near-black, never slate, never pure black)
- shadow: `shadow.modal`
- radius: `radius.lg` for the surface
- buttons: `<Button>`, with the action row at `justifyContent: flex-end`,
  Cancel first, primary action last

Side panels anchored to a screen edge use `shadow.panel`.

### Inputs / selects — consistent border and radius

Form inputs and `<select>` controls use:

- border: `1px solid ${color.border.default}` (use `border.strong` only
  for emphasis — most inputs should be `default`)
- radius: `radius.sm`
- padding: `8px 10px` (or `padding: 8` for compact contexts)

Don't set `appearance: "auto"` on a `<select>` — it bypasses the rest of
the styling and produces a native control next to custom-looking ones.
- Modal scrims are `rgba(15, 15, 15, 0.45)` (warm-neutral, matches the
  greyscale palette). Don't use slate-tinted scrims (`rgba(15, 23, 42, ...)`).

Adding a new token: edit `theme.ts`, leave a one-line comment if the
intent isn't obvious from the name, and migrate any callers in the same
PR. Don't accumulate parallel ad-hoc colors.

### Components

- Functional, typed props.
- Server components are fine, but anything reading auth must be `"use client"`.
- Place reusable components under `src/components/<area>/` and route-scoped
  components co-located with the route.

## Testing

### Backend

- `pytest`. The FastAPI app exposes `create_app()` → wrap with
  `fastapi.testclient.TestClient`. Sign in a test client via
  `tests/_auth.py:login_fastapi(client, user_id)` which mints a
  ``SessionMiddleware``-compatible cookie.
- Per-test isolation:
  - the conftest creates a unique Postgres schema per test against
    `TEST_DATABASE_URL` (default `postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/agent_wiki_test`)
    and points `CONFIG.database_url` at it via libpq's `options=-csearch_path=...`;
    the schema is dropped on teardown. The test database itself must already
    exist with `pg_textsearch` and `pgmq` installed.
  - point `WIKI_DIR` at a tmp directory; `ensure_wiki_repo()` will init it.
- **Mock at the seam, not the SDK.** Patch `app.llm.client.complete` to return
  a canned normalized dict. Never patch `anthropic.Anthropic` directly.
- **Don't mock git.** The git wrapper is small and shelling out against a
  real tmp repo gives you real coverage. Mocking `subprocess` is brittle.
- **Don't mock the database.** Use a real per-test schema; `init_db()`
  runs `alembic upgrade head` against it. Shared seed/inspection
  helpers live in `tests/_seed.py`.
- For tasks, use `queue.immediate_mode()` (a context manager that
  saves/restores the flag) in the test fixture and call the task
  synchronously, asserting on side effects. Don't set
  `queue.immediate = True` directly — the bare assignment will leak
  state across tests if the body raises.
- Full-stack flow tests live under `tests/integration/`. The
  `integration` fixture there wires a FastAPI ``TestClient`` + real
  DB + real wiki repo + scripted LLM mock. See
  `local_data/wiki/integration-tests.md`.

### Frontend

Type-check with `npm run typecheck`. Component tests can be added with Vitest
+ React Testing Library when needed. Keep components pure functions of props
so they're trivially testable.

## Adding a feature — checklist

1. New persistent state? Edit `app/db/models.py`.
2. New repo functions in `app/<area>/<thing>.py` — keep them tight, return rows.
3. New domain logic next to the repo, not inside the API route.
4. Expose via an `APIRouter` in `app/api/<thing>.py`, registered in
   `app/main.py:create_app`. Gate with `Depends(require_user)` or
   `Depends(require_admin)`.
5. If the work is non-trivial or hits the LLM, queue a task.
6. Add a pydantic model in `app/models/` for any non-trivial request/response.
7. Frontend: add a typed call in a `src/lib/<thing>.ts` (or extend an existing
   lib), then a page or component that uses it via `apiFetch` and `useAuth`.

## What not to do

- Don't import `anthropic`, `openai`, `google.genai`, or `ollama` outside the
  matching `app/llm/providers/<name>.py` module.
- Don't read `request.session` outside `app/api/auth.py` (where login/logout
  write it) and `app/auth/deps.py` (where ``current_user`` reads it).
- Don't shell out to `git` outside `app/wiki/git.py`.
- Don't put business logic inside a FastAPI route handler — push it to a
  domain module.
- Don't write raw SQL outside `app/db/fts.py` (pg_textsearch operator)
  and `app/tasks/queue.py` (pgmq functions). Use the ORM session.
- Don't read provider keys from `os.environ` or `CONFIG` at call time —
  go through `app/llm/settings.py:get()` so the admin UI overrides take effect.
- Don't leak raw exceptions through the API. Translate to `{error: msg}` with
  a sensible status.
- Don't make destructive CLI calls (force push, hard reset on the wiki repo)
  — every wiki commit should be additive history.
- Don't reach for `@dataclass` — use `pydantic.BaseModel` (see the data
  classes seam above).
- Don't write a raw hex color, border-radius integer, or shadow string in a
  React component — import from `src/lib/theme.ts`. If the shade isn't
  there, add it there. (See the design tokens seam above.)
- Don't roll a new primary/secondary/danger button in a component — use
  `<Button>` from `src/components/common/Button.tsx`. (See the buttons seam.)
- Don't use slate-tinted (`rgba(15,23,42,…)`) or pure-black modal scrims —
  use `color.overlay`. Don't invent ad-hoc modal shadows — use
  `shadow.modal`. (See the modals seam.)

## Open questions worth knowing

- **Cost** — every connector update fans out to a doc-updater LLM pass.
  Batching/debounce isn't built yet; new ingestion paths should land behind
  a task so we can add backpressure later without changing the API.
- **Doc bloat / loss** — the `document_updater` system prompt forbids both,
  but we'll need eval data. If you change the prompt, save the old version
  in git history (it already does — don't squash).
- **Permissioning** — implemented. Per-page read/write ACLs with users,
  groups, and an `everyone` principal; folder grants cascade; admins
  bypass; pages with no owner row and no ACL row are implicit-public
  until managed (covers test setups and seed scripts that bypass the
  lifecycle hook).
  Open follow-ups (deny rows, `.acl.yaml`-in-git mirror, group
  self-service) are tracked in `local_data/wiki/permissions/permissions.md`.
