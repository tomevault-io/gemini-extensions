# Mortise

## What this is

Self-hosted Railway-style deploy platform for Kubernetes. One operator, one
Helm chart. Users connect a git repo or pick an image → Mortise handles
builds, deploys, domains, TLS, env vars, volumes, preview envs, and bindings.
Kubernetes is fully abstracted away from the user.

Read SPEC.md for the full product spec. Read ARCHITECTURE.md for system
diagrams. This file is the operating manual for working in this codebase.

## Releases

See `RELEASING.md` for the full convention. Short version: one semver
git tag (`v0.1.1`) triggers the `release.yml` workflow, which builds a
multi-arch image (`ghcr.io/mortise-org/mortise:0.1.1`), stamps and
packages both charts, publishes to `gh-pages`, and creates a GitHub
Release. Chart version, `appVersion`, and image tag are always the same
number. Never edit `Chart.yaml` `version:` or `appVersion:` by hand.
CI owns them.

## Tech stack

- **Operator + API:** Go, kubebuilder, controller-runtime
- **UI:** SvelteKit + TypeScript (embedded in operator binary via embed.FS)
- **CLI:** Go (cobra)
- **Helm charts:** charts/mortise/ (batteries-included umbrella), charts/mortise-core/ (operator only)
- **CRDs:** Project, App, PlatformConfig, GitProvider, PreviewEnvironment, ProjectMember
- **Bundled tools (in umbrella chart):** BuildKit (image builds), OCI registry, Traefik
  (ingress), cert-manager (TLS)

## Architecture rules

These are non-negotiable. Violating any of them is a bug.

### Standards, not implementations

Mortise couples to standards, not specific tools:
- k8s Ingress API: not Traefik-specific annotations
- OCI Distribution Spec: not implementation-specific APIs
- OIDC: not Authentik-specific APIs
- ACME (via cert-manager): not Let's Encrypt-specific

If you're about to write code that only works with one specific tool (Traefik,
GitHub), it must be behind an interface in internal/<name>/.

### Controllers never import third-party SDKs

All external calls go through interfaces defined in internal/<name>/.
Controllers import only Mortise's own types. Never import go-github,
moby/buildkit/client, or any other third-party SDK in a controller file.

### Interfaces (internal seams, not plug-in APIs)

These exist for testability and version-bump isolation. They are NOT extension
points for outside implementers.

```
controller  →  AuthProvider     →  native DB | generic OIDC
controller  →  PolicyEngine     →  native (admin/member)
controller  →  GitAPI           →  GitHub | GitLab | Gitea
controller  →  GitClient        →  go-git (single impl)
controller  →  BuildClient      →  BuildKit (single impl)
controller  →  RegistryBackend  →  generic OCI (config-driven)
controller  →  IngressProvider  →  generic annotation-driven
```

DNS is annotation-driven via ExternalDNS (no Go interface: see SPEC §11.1).

No interface without a real v1 implementation behind it.

### Everything is an App, grouped under Projects

One CRD for workloads, one concept. Source type (git | image) determines
how it deploys. No separate ServiceInstance, DatabaseInstance, or similar
CRDs. Backing services (Postgres, Redis) are Apps with
`network.public: false` and a `credentials` block. Other Apps bind to them.

**Apps live inside Projects, not free-floating.** Every App belongs to
exactly one Project; its *control* namespace is `pj-{project-name}` and
its *workload* namespaces are `pj-{project-name}-{env-name}` (one per
environment). Apps, PreviewEnvironments, and other project-owned CRDs
live in the control namespace; Deployments, Services, Ingresses, Pods,
PVCs, env-scoped Secrets and ConfigMaps live in the per-env namespace.
Users, URLs, and CLI commands scope to a current project context. When
in doubt about where something goes: does it exist PER PROJECT (apps,
secrets, domains, preview envs) or PER PLATFORM (users, git providers,
DNS config, platform domain)? Per-project → lives under the control
namespace. Per-platform → lives in `mortise-system` or a cluster-scoped
CRD.

### Mortise owns only what it creates

Never touch resources Mortise didn't create. Coexist with Argo CD, Flux,
manually-deployed resources, other operators. Check for ownership labels
before modifying or deleting any resource.

### No addon/plug-in architecture

Mortise is one operator, one Helm chart. No subcharts, no plug-in SDK, no
extension registry. Third-party integration happens through Kubernetes
primitives (ESO writes k8s Secrets, OPA gates admission, Prometheus scrapes
standard metrics). If you're tempted to add a plug-in system, stop.

## Behavioral guidelines

### Think before coding

- State assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them: don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so.

### Simplicity first

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

### Surgical changes

- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style.
- Every changed line should trace directly to the task.
- Remove imports/variables/functions YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

### Goal-driven execution

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:
```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

## Testing

### Commands

```bash
make test                 # unit + envtest, <10s, run before every commit
make test-charts          # helm lint + template tests, no cluster, <30s
make test-integration     # spins up k3d, installs chart, runs suite, tears down
make test-chart-integration # [release only] full chart: k3d + PVC + install script (~10min)
make test-e2e             # Playwright E2E against dev cluster (requires make dev-up)
make dev-up               # persistent k3d + tilt live-reload for active dev
make dev-down             # tear down dev cluster
make test-integration-fast # run integration suite against existing dev cluster
```

### Layers

| Layer | Tool | What it tests | Speed |
|---|---|---|---|
| Unit | go test + fake client | Pure logic, no cluster | <10s |
| envtest | controller-runtime envtest | Reconcile loops, real apiserver+etcd | ~2s/test |
| Chart lint | helm lint + template | Chart schema, toggle combos, PVC defaults | <30s |
| Integration | k3d + Helm install | Real cluster, real pods, real networking | <3min total |
| Chart integration | k3d + umbrella chart | Full chart deploy, PVC persistence, install script | ~10min (release only) |
| UI E2E | Playwright | Critical user flows against k3d | Per PR |

### Conventions

- `//go:build integration` tag separates integration from unit tests.
- Every integration test creates its own namespace via `CreateTestNamespace(t)`.
  Registered with `t.Cleanup`. Tests are independent.
- Fixtures live in `test/fixtures/`. Tests load by path via `LoadFixture(t, path)`,
  mutate, then apply. Never hand-write App YAML in test code.
- Assertion helpers in `test/helpers/`: `RequireEventually`, `AssertPodsRunning`,
  `AssertIngressExists`, `WaitForAppReady`.
- `TestMain` in `test/integration/suite_test.go` asserts cluster + chart ready.
  No per-test cluster lifecycle.

### Mocking policy

- **BuildKit:** mock BuildClient interface in unit tests. Real BuildKit only in
  integration tests.
- **Git providers:** mock GitAPI at the interface boundary for unit tests. Local
  Gitea in integration tests.
- **ACME:** Pebble (local ACME server) in integration tests. Never hit real
  Let's Encrypt.
- **DNS:** ExternalDNS in-memory provider in integration tests.
- **Registry:** real Distribution registry in the k3d cluster for integration tests.
- **Time:** any TTL/timeout logic takes `clock.Clock` (k8s.io/utils/clock).
  Tests inject fake clock. Never call `time.Now()` directly in controllers.

### Writing new tests

1. Find the nearest existing test that's similar.
2. Copy it.
3. Change the fixture reference.
4. Change the assertions.
5. Run it.

This is the expected workflow. Tests should be boring and repetitive, not
clever. If a test requires novel infrastructure, that's a sign the harness
needs extending: fix the harness first.

### UI E2E (Playwright) standards

**Coverage requirement:** Every button, link, input, toggle, and interactive
element that exists in the UI must be exercised by at least one test. Every
user-facing feature must have end-to-end coverage. No exceptions.

**Real API only:** E2E tests call the real backend API: no `page.route()`
mocking of Mortise business logic. Use `loginViaAPI`, `createProjectViaAPI`,
`createAppViaAPI`, etc. from `tests/e2e/helpers.ts`. The only acceptable
mocks are OAuth redirect flows and external third-party services.

**Selector discipline: these are bugs, not style preferences:**

- Always use `{ exact: true }` with `getByRole('button', { name: 'X' })`.
  Canvas AppNode divs have `tabindex="0" role="button"` and their accessible
  name is `"Handle Handle {app-name}"`. Playwright's `getByRole` does
  case-insensitive substring matching, so any app whose name contains "x"
  silently matches `{ name: 'X' }`. Without `exact: true`, tests pick the
  wrong element and time out instead of failing with a clear error.

- Use `getByRole('heading', { name: 'X' })` instead of `getByText('X')` for
  section headings. `getByText` does partial substring matching and will match
  description paragraphs, option values, and nav links in addition to the
  heading: causing strict-mode violations.

- Use `getByTitle('X', { exact: true })` when there are multiple elements
  with similar title= attributes (e.g., "Activity" vs "Activity rail").

- Variable name placeholder is `'VARIABLE_NAME'` (not `'KEY'`).
  Variable value placeholder is `'value or binding ref'` (not `'value'`).

- Project settings has a tabbed layout: click `getByRole('button', { name:
  'Danger' })` before asserting on danger-zone content.

- `page.locator('div').filter({ hasText: 'X' }).last()` picks the innermost
  div containing X, which may have no child buttons. Scope to a known
  container (e.g., `page.locator('section#git-providers')`) instead.

**Run a targeted subset while iterating:**
```bash
cd ui && MORTISE_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8080 \
  MORTISE_ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@local MORTISE_ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin123 \
  npx playwright test tests/e2e/myfile.spec.ts --reporter=list
```

## What Mortise creates per App

When an App is reconciled, the operator creates and manages:
- Namespace (one per Project, shared by all Apps in that project)
- Deployment (image, replicas, resources, env vars, volume mounts)
- Service (stable internal DNS for the pods)
- Ingress (domain routing, TLS annotations, ingress class)
- PVC(s) (one per storage entry)
- Secret(s) (projected from secret store for env vars)
- ServiceAccount + imagePullSecret (registry credentials)

All owned by the App via controller-runtime's `controllerutil.SetControllerReference`.
Deleting the App garbage-collects everything.

## Common mistakes to avoid

- Adding Traefik-specific IngressRoute CRDs instead of standard Ingress
- Importing third-party SDKs in controller files
- Creating new CRD kinds for things that should be Apps
- Using `time.Now()` instead of injected clock
- Writing integration tests that depend on test execution order
- Adding "helpful" abstractions or plug-in machinery
- Using `:latest` tags anywhere: always pin digests or specific versions
- Adding comments that describe WHAT instead of WHY
- Writing workload resources (Deployment, Service, Ingress, Pod, PVC,
  env-scoped Secret/ConfigMap) into the control namespace `pj-{project}`.
  Those belong in the per-env namespace `pj-{project}-{env}`. Only
  project-scoped CRDs (App, PreviewEnvironment) and project-level
  resources (activity ConfigMap, registry creds) live in the control ns.
- Hard-coding the legacy `project-{name}` prefix. The current convention
  is `pj-{name}` for control ns and `pj-{name}-{env}` for env ns.
  always go through `internal/constants` helpers.
