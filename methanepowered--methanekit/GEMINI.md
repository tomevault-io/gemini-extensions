This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project

Methane Kit is a cross-platform C++20 3D graphics abstraction library and application framework. It wraps DirectX 12, Vulkan and Metal behind one object-oriented API (RHI), with a single HLSL 6 shader codebase compiled to all backends at build time.

CMake 3.24+ is required; the `VS2026-*` presets additionally need **CMake 4.2+**, which is where the `Visual Studio 18 2026` generator they use was added. External dependencies are **not** git submodules — they are fetched by [CPM.cmake](https://github.com/cpm-cmake/CPM.cmake) during CMake configure into `Build/Output/ExternalsCache/` (override with `-DCPM_SOURCE_CACHE=<path>`). The first configure is slow because of this.

## Build & Test

Preferred path is CMake presets. Preset names follow `[VS2022|VS2026|Xcode|Make|Ninja]-[Win64|Win32|Win|Lin|Mac|iOS|tvOS]-[Sim]-[DX|VK|MTL]-[Default|Profile|Scan]`; the matching *build* preset replaces `Default` with `Debug` or `Release`. List them with `cmake --list-presets` and `cmake --list-presets build`.

```bash
cmake --preset VS2026-Win64-DX-Default
cmake --build --preset VS2026-Win64-DX-Debug
```

Build output goes to `Build/Output/<ConfigPresetName>/Build`, installs to `.../Install`.

Build a single target (much faster than the whole solution):

```bash
cmake --build --preset VS2026-Win64-VK-Debug --target MethaneHelloTriangle
```

Auxiliary scripts wrap the raw CMake invocation: `Build/Windows/Build.bat [--vs2022] [--win32] [--debug] [--vulkan] [--tracy] [--itt] [--logs] ...` and `Build/Unix/Build.sh [--debug] [--vulkan VULKAN_SDK_PATH] [--apple-platform ...] ...`.

### Tests

Tests use Catch2 and are registered with CTest via `catch_discover_tests` ([Tests/CMake/CatchDiscoverAndRunTests.cmake](Tests/CMake/CatchDiscoverAndRunTests.cmake)). Run all from the build directory:

```bash
ctest --test-dir Build/Output/VS2026-Win64-VK-Default/Build -C Debug --output-on-failure
```

Filter by test name with CTest:

```bash
ctest --test-dir Build/Output/VS2026-Win64-VK-Default/Build -C Debug -R "Render Context" --output-on-failure
```

Or invoke the Catch2 binary directly, selecting a single case by name or a group by tag (`--list-tests` shows both; names are prefixed `RHI `, tags look like `[device][rhi]`):

```bash
./Build/Output/VS2026-Win64-VK-Default/Build/Tests/Graphics/RHI/Debug/MethaneGraphicsRhiTest.exe "RHI Render Context Basic Functions"
```

```bash
./Build/Output/VS2026-Win64-VK-Default/Build/Tests/Graphics/RHI/Debug/MethaneGraphicsRhiTest.exe "[device]"
```

`METHANE_RUN_TESTS_DURING_BUILD` (initially `ON`, but `OFF` in all presets) runs CTest as a post-build step.

Tests never touch a real GPU: they link `MethaneGraphicsRhiNull`/`MethaneGraphicsRhiNullImpl`, the Null RHI backend that exists solely for unit testing.

### Key CMake options

`METHANE_GFX_VULKAN_ENABLED` (default `OFF`) switches Windows/macOS from their native API (DirectX 12 / Metal) to Vulkan; Linux is always Vulkan. Others worth knowing: `METHANE_CHECKS_ENABLED`, `METHANE_LOGGING_ENABLED` (off even in Debug presets — `META_LOG` is compiled out), `METHANE_RHI_PIMPL_INLINE_ENABLED`, `METHANE_TRACY_PROFILING_ENABLED`, `METHANE_ITT_INSTRUMENTATION_ENABLED`, `METHANE_GPU_INSTRUMENTATION_ENABLED`. Full table in [Build/README.md](Build/README.md#cmake-options).

## Architecture

### Module layers

Five layers of increasing abstraction, each a directory under [Modules/](Modules): `Common` (primitives, checks, instrumentation) → `Data` (types, events, ranges, animation, providers) → `Platform` (app window, input, app view) → `Graphics` (RHI, camera, mesh, primitives, app base) → `UserInterface` (typography, widgets, UI app). [Modules/Kit](Modules/Kit) is the umbrella target pulling everything together.

### Graphics RHI — the core abstraction

[Modules/Graphics/RHI](Modules/Graphics/RHI) is where most work happens. It is deliberately split, and the dependency direction matters:

```
Interface ──> Base ──> {DirectX | Vulkan | Metal | Null} ──> Impl
```

- **[Interface](Modules/Graphics/RHI/Interface)** — public virtual interfaces (`IDevice`, `IRenderContext`, `ICommandList`, …) and shared settings structs. No implementation.
- **[Base](Modules/Graphics/RHI/Base)** — API-agnostic logic shared by every backend (command list state tracking, resource lifetime retention, object registry). Backend classes derive from these.
- **[DirectX](Modules/Graphics/RHI/DirectX) / [Vulkan](Modules/Graphics/RHI/Vulkan) / [Metal](Modules/Graphics/RHI/Metal) / [Null](Modules/Graphics/RHI/Null)** — native implementations. Exactly one is compiled, chosen by CMake.
- **[Impl](Modules/Graphics/RHI/Impl)** — PIMPL value-type wrappers (`Rhi::Device`, `Rhi::RenderContext`, …) that applications actually use. These are what tutorials are written against, not the virtual interfaces.

A change to RHI behaviour usually means editing `Base` (if it is API-independent) plus each native backend. Because only one backend compiles per configuration, **a change to Vulkan code is not compile-checked by a DirectX build** — build the relevant preset.

The backend is selected in CMake, not C++: `get_default_graphics_api()` in [CMake/MethaneModules.cmake](CMake/MethaneModules.cmake) sets `METHANE_GFX_API`, and [Modules/Graphics/RHI/CMakeLists.txt](Modules/Graphics/RHI/CMakeLists.txt) adds only the matching subdirectory.

### PIMPL layer

[Modules/Common/Primitives/Include/Methane/Pimpl.h](Modules/Common/Primitives/Include/Methane/Pimpl.h) defines `META_PIMPL_API`, `META_PIMPL_METHODS_DECLARE`, `META_PIMPL_NOEXCEPT`. When `METHANE_RHI_PIMPL_INLINE_ENABLED` is on (default in Release), the `.cpp` bodies are included into headers and inlined, so `META_PIMPL_API` becomes `inline` and the Impl library is header-only. This means editing an Impl `.cpp` can trigger wide rebuilds in inlined configurations.

### Shaders

One HLSL 6 source serves all backends. In CMake:

```cmake
add_methane_shaders_source(TARGET ${TARGET} SOURCE Shaders/HelloTriangle.hlsl VERSION 6_0
                           TYPES vert=TriangleVS frag=TrianglePS)
add_methane_shaders_library(${TARGET})
```

`TYPES` maps a shader stage to its entry-point function. DirectX compiles HLSL→DXIL and Vulkan HLSL→SPIRV with DirectXCompiler; Metal goes HLSL→SPIRV→MSL via SPIRV-Cross (or DXIL→Metal with `METHANE_METAL_SHADER_CONVERTER_ENABLED`). Compiled shaders are embedded as resources by `add_methane_shaders_library`. See [CMake/MethaneShaders.cmake](CMake/MethaneShaders.cmake).

### Applications

Tutorials live in [Apps/](Apps) and are declared with `add_methane_application(TARGET ... NAME ... DESCRIPTION ... INSTALL_DIR ... SOURCES ...)` from [CMake/MethaneApplications.cmake](CMake/MethaneApplications.cmake). Shared tutorial settings are in [Apps/Common](Apps/Common) (`GetGraphicsTutorialAppSettings`). Embedding assets uses `add_methane_embedded_fonts` / `_textures` / `_icons` from [CMake/MethaneResources.cmake](CMake/MethaneResources.cmake).

Note `Apps/02-HelloCube` and `Apps/07-ParallelRendering` each build **two** executables from one directory via a `VARIANT` suffix (e.g. `MethaneHelloCubeSimple` / `MethaneHelloCubeUniforms`).

## Conventions

- Namespaces mirror directories: `Methane::Graphics::Vulkan`, `Methane::Data`, `Methane::Platform`, `Methane::Graphics::Rhi`.
- Platform-specific sources sit in a `Windows/` / `Linux/` / `MacOS/` / `Apple/` subdirectory and are picked up by `get_platform_dir()`; on Apple the extension becomes `.mm`.
- Nearly every function body opens with `META_FUNCTION_TASK();` — the instrumentation hook for Tracy/ITT. Keep it when adding functions.
- Argument validation uses the `META_CHECK_*` family from [Modules/Common/Primitives/Include/Methane/Checks.hpp](Modules/Common/Primitives/Include/Methane/Checks.hpp) (`META_CHECK_NOT_NULL`, `META_CHECK_LESS`, `META_CHECK_EQUAL_DESCR`, `META_CHECK_NOT_ZERO_DESCR`, …). They throw typed exceptions and compile away when `METHANE_CHECKS_ENABLED` is off, so never put side effects in the checked expression. The `_DESCR` variants take an fmt format string.
- `META_LOG` is a no-op unless `METHANE_LOGGING_ENABLED=ON`, which is off in all presets — do not rely on it for diagnosing a failure in a default build.

## CI

[.github/workflows/ci-build.yml](.github/workflows/ci-build.yml) builds the same CMake presets used locally across Windows (DX/VK, x64/x86), Linux, macOS, iOS and tvOS. `ci-sonar-scan.yml` and `ci-codeql-scan.yml` run static analysis using the `-Scan` presets.
