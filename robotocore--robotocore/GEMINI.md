# Moto Implementation Strategy

## What works

- **gen_resource_lifecycle_test.py** generates good test skeletons from botocore shapes
- **gen_moto_impl.py** generates ~80% correct scaffolding but ONLY for response methods — agents often forget backend methods
- Not-found tests pass reliably — the implementations raise correct exceptions
- Three protocol patterns are well-understood: JSON (Glue), rest-json catchall (OpenSearch), rest-json explicit URLs (Connect/EKS)
- Service fixtures (SERVICE_FIXTURES) work well for prerequisite resources
- **Manual test files** work better than auto-generated for non-CRUD ops (standalone describes, deployment/revision lookups)

## Critical agent pitfalls

### Agents write response methods but forget backend methods
The most common failure: agent adds `responses.py` methods that call `self.backend.create_foo()` but never adds `create_foo()` to the backend class in `models.py`. Always verify both files.

### Cognito-IDP has two backend classes
`CognitoIdpBackend` (line ~999) and `RegionAgnosticBackend` (line ~2398). Methods must go on `CognitoIdpBackend`, not `RegionAgnosticBackend`. The `update_user_attributes` method at the end of `RegionAgnosticBackend` is a trap — new methods placed after it land on the wrong class.

### gen_moto_impl.py has many false positives
It reports nouns as "missing" if ANY CRUD op is unimplemented. Many services (EKS, EMR, cognito-idp, emr-serverless, stepfunctions) show false positives because:
- Operations are implemented but with different method names
- Operations are in a parser/provider submodule
- The moto module name differs from the boto3 service name (e.g., `emrserverless` vs `emr-serverless`)

Always verify with `probe_service.py` before implementing.

### Native providers have separate state from Moto
Robotocore has native providers for Lambda, SFN, ECS, etc. that maintain their own in-memory state (e.g., `_state_machines`, `EcsStore`). Operations NOT in the native provider's `_ACTION_MAP` are forwarded to Moto, which has a completely separate state store. If a resource was created by the native provider, Moto can't see it. When implementing new operations, check if the service has a native provider at `src/robotocore/services/{svc}/provider.py` and add the new ops there instead of (or in addition to) Moto.

### Moto lockfile update requires cache clear
After pushing moto changes, `uv lock --upgrade-package moto` may return the cached old commit. Use `uv cache clean moto --force` first, then `uv lock --upgrade-package moto`. Also push to the correct remote branch name (`robotocore/all-fixes:robotocore/all-fixes`).

## Test generator features (implemented)

- **ID capture**: Captures server-generated IDs from create responses and threads them through describe/delete calls
- **Doc-based param aliasing**: When param ends with "Id" but botocore docs mention "name", generates name value (e.g., CloudTrail DashboardId)
- **Integer min values**: Respects botocore `min` constraints on integer shapes
- **Required-only strict assertions**: Only asserts `isinstance` for botocore-required output fields, not optional ones
- **Tagged union shapes**: Generates correct first-member values for union types (e.g., `DataSourceType={"S3GlueDataCatalog": {}}`)
- **Service fixtures**: Creates prerequisite resources (connect instance, org, vault, cluster, domain, user pool)

## Service fixtures available

| Service | Fixture | Creates |
|---------|---------|---------|
| connect | `instance_id` | Connect instance |
| organizations | `org` (autouse) | Organization |
| backup | `vault_name` | Backup vault |
| eks | `cluster_name` | EKS cluster + IAM role |
| opensearch | `domain_name` | OpenSearch domain |
| cognito-idp | `user_pool_id` | User pool |

## Protocol-specific patterns

| Protocol | Params from | Returns | URL changes |
|----------|------------|---------|-------------|
| JSON (Glue, EMR, Cognito) | `self.parameters` | `ActionResult(dict)` / `EmptyResult()` | None |
| rest-json catchall (IoT, OpenSearch) | `self._get_param()` + URL path | `json.dumps(dict)` / `"{}"` | None |
| rest-json explicit (Connect, EKS) | `self._get_param()`, URL path | `ActionResult(dict)` / `json.dumps(dict)` | Add URL entries to urls.py |

## Worktree workflow for parallel implementation

1. Create worktree: `git worktree add ../robotocore-{svc} -b impl/{svc} HEAD`
2. Init submodule: `cd worktree && git submodule update --init vendor/moto`
3. Agent implements in worktree, commits to worktree branch
4. Copy changed files from worktree to main: `cp worktree/vendor/moto/moto/{svc}/* main/vendor/moto/moto/{svc}/`
5. Commit in main vendor/moto, push to fork, update lockfile
6. Clean up: `rm -rf worktree && git worktree prune && git branch -D impl/{svc}`

Key lessons:
- Submodule commits in worktrees can't be cherry-picked (different git databases). Use file copy.
- Push to the correct remote branch: `git push jackdanger robotocore/all-fixes:robotocore/all-fixes`
- Always verify installed moto has the new methods after sync (check with `python3 -c "from moto.{svc}.models import ..."`).

## Moto update flow

1. Edit vendor/moto/moto/{service}/models.py + responses.py
2. Push: `cd vendor/moto && git push jackdanger robotocore/all-fixes:robotocore/all-fixes`
3. Lock: `cd ../.. && uv lock --upgrade-package moto`
4. Sync: `uv sync`
5. Restart server: `make stop && make start`
6. Verify: `python3 -c "from moto.{svc}.models import BackendClass; print(hasattr(BackendClass, 'new_method'))"`

## Services with native providers (must add ops there, not just Moto)

| Service | Provider file | State store |
|---------|--------------|-------------|
| Lambda | `services/lambda_/provider.py` | Module-level dicts + moto backend |
| Step Functions | `services/stepfunctions/provider.py` | `_state_machines`, `_versions`, `_aliases` |
| ECS | `services/ecs/provider.py` | `EcsStore` per region/account |
| Rekognition | `services/rekognition/provider.py` | `_collections` per (account, region) |
| IoT | `services/iot/provider.py` | Forwards unmatched to Moto |
| ECR | `services/ecr/provider.py` | Forwards unmatched to Moto |
| EventBridge | `services/events/provider.py` | - |

## Additional learnings from batches 4-7

### Response shape mismatches
Agents often return responses in a wrong structure. Always check botocore output shapes:
```python
import botocore.session
s = botocore.session.get_session()
model = s.get_service_model('service_name')
op = model.operation_model('OperationName')
print(op.output_shape.members.keys())
```
Common mistakes: nesting fields under a wrapper key when botocore expects top-level, using wrong field names.

### Some botocore output shapes are empty
New AWS APIs (OSS Index, Batch ConsumableResource create) have nearly empty output shapes. Botocore strips any extra fields from the response. Only assert on fields present in the botocore output shape.

### NamedTuple models are immutable
IdentityStore uses NamedTuples for Group and User. Update operations must create new instances with `._replace()` or constructor.

### Services already have some implementations
Always check existing code before implementing. Batch had ConsumableResource fully done. Run `gen_moto_impl.py --list-nouns` which reports partial gaps (e.g., missing just Update when CRUD exists).

### Direct implementation is faster than agents for small ops
For 1-3 simple operations, implementing directly is faster than spawning subagents. Reserve agents for services with 3+ nouns or complex patterns.
