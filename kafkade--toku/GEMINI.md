## toku

> Toku (読く — Japanese for "to read") is a private, offline-first personal book manager. It combines the metadata depth of Calibre, the reading tracking of Goodreads, and the analytics of StoryGraph — without any social features. Phases 0–7 are complete (CLI, imports, analytics, web dashboard, native apps, file management, and sync). A watchOS companion app is planned (tracked in #178).

# Copilot Instructions for Toku

## Project Overview

Toku (読く — Japanese for "to read") is a private, offline-first personal book manager. It combines the metadata depth of Calibre, the reading tracking of Goodreads, and the analytics of StoryGraph — without any social features. Phases 0–7 are complete (CLI, imports, analytics, web dashboard, native apps, file management, and sync). A watchOS companion app is planned (tracked in #178).

## Non-Negotiable Constraints

Every code contribution, architecture decision, and feature design must uphold these:

1. **Local-first** — The app must work fully offline. All core features (library management, reading tracking, statistics, search, import, export) function without an internet connection. Network access is only for optional metadata enrichment.
2. **No social features** — No friends, followers, feeds, book clubs, or shared reviews. This is a personal tool. The user is the sole audience for their data.
3. **User data ownership** — The user owns 100% of their data in portable, open formats. Full export at any time. No vendor lock-in.
4. **Import as a superpower** — Importing from Goodreads, Calibre, and StoryGraph must be frictionless, idempotent, and lossless. Import quality is a first-impression feature.
5. **CLI-first** — The CLI is the primary interface and a first-class product. Web, iOS, macOS, and Windows are future platforms built on the same core library.

## Architecture

Cargo workspace with 12 crates:

- `toku-core/` — Domain models, traits, state machine, statistics engine. Pure Rust, no I/O. Compiles to native, WASM, FFI.
- `toku-db/` — SQLite persistence, schema migrations (refinery), FTS5 full-text search.
- `toku-import/` — Import implementations: Goodreads CSV, Calibre metadata.db, StoryGraph.
- `toku-meta/` — Metadata fetching: Open Library API (primary), Google Books (fallback). Cover image downloading.
- `toku-files/` — Ebook file management: association, SHA-256 integrity verification, disk organization, and format conversion (via Calibre's `ebook-convert`).
- `toku-cli/` — CLI binary (clap v4). The main entry point.
- `toku-export/` — Export implementations: CSV, JSON, Markdown, BibTeX, canonical backup.
- `toku-ffi/` — C FFI bindings for Swift/Kotlin via `cbindgen`. Used by macOS and iOS apps.
- `toku-web/` — Axum + maud web server. Library views, statistics dashboard, import wizard, OPDS catalog. Started via `toku serve`.
- `toku-desktop/` — Tauri v2 Windows desktop app wrapping the web UI.
- `toku-sync/` — Self-hostable, zero-knowledge sync relay server (stores only client-encrypted ciphertext).
- `toku-sync-client/` — Client-side sync engine: end-to-end encryption, HLC-based conflict resolution, and op propagation.

### Data Boundary Rule

| Data Type | Storage | Network? |
|---|---|---|
| User's book library, reading sessions, notes, ratings | Local SQLite — plaintext at rest (OS full-disk encryption only; app-level DB encryption is future #204) | Never sent unless sync opted in |
| Book metadata from APIs | Cached locally after fetch | Open Library / Google Books (optional) |
| Cover images | Local filesystem, content-addressed (SHA-256) | Fetched once, stored locally forever |
| Import source data (Goodreads CSV, Calibre DB) | Parsed on-device, stored in local DB | Never leaves device |
| Statistics and analytics | Computed locally from user data | Never sent anywhere |

**Where encryption actually applies** — keep these four guarantees distinct; do not conflate them:

- **Local, at rest** — the working `toku.db` is **plaintext**. `Database::open` sets only `journal_mode=WAL` + `foreign_keys=ON`, and `rusqlite` uses bundled SQLite (not SQLCipher), so protection depends entirely on **OS full-disk encryption**. Optional app-level at-rest encryption is future work (#204).
- **In transit (self-host / sync)** — network confidentiality relies on **operator-provided TLS**; Toku does not ship its own transport layer.
- **Relay (zero-knowledge E2E)** — the sync relay stores **only client-encrypted ciphertext** and never sees plaintext or keys.
- **Web dashboard** — `toku serve` is a **trusted local server** that holds plaintext while running; treat it as inside your trust boundary.

### Key Data Model Decisions

- **Book = Edition** for MVP. A nullable `work_id` column enables Work grouping in Phase 3.
- **Ratings**: 0–10 integer, displayed as 5★ with half-star increments. Goodreads-compatible.
- **Identifiers**: ISBN-10, ISBN-13, ASIN, Open Library ID, Goodreads ID. Books without ISBNs are fully supported.
- **Contributors**: Author, Editor, Translator, Illustrator, Narrator (audiobooks) — via BookAuthor join table with role enum.
- **Provenance**: Every metadata field tracks its source (user entry, Goodreads import, Open Library API) and timestamp. User edits always take precedence.

## Conventions

- **License**: MIT — all contributions must be compatible
- **PR title format**: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `refactor:`, `chore:`
- **Commit trailer**: Include `Co-authored-by: Copilot <223556219+Copilot@users.noreply.github.com>` when Copilot contributes
- **Error handling**: `thiserror` for library crates, `anyhow` for CLI binary. No `unwrap()` in user-facing paths.
- **CLI output**: Respect `NO_COLOR` env var. Support `--format table|json|csv` for all list commands.
- **Database migrations**: Use `refinery` with embedded SQL migrations. Migrations are idempotent.
- **Import idempotency**: Every importer stores source IDs (e.g., `goodreads_id`) for dedup on re-import. User edits are never overwritten.

## Git Policy

**Never execute Git commands that modify history or submit code.** This includes `git commit`, `git push`, `git rebase`, `git merge`, `git reset`, `git cherry-pick`, `git revert`, and `git tag`. Read-only commands like `git status`, `git diff`, `git log`, and `git branch` are fine. The maintainer must always review and commit changes themselves.

## CI / Infrastructure Dependency

**Branch protection for this repo is managed via Terraform in `kafkade/github-infra` (`repo_toku.tf`).** The `required_status_checks` list must match the job names in `.github/workflows/validate.yml`. If you rename, add, or remove CI jobs that are used as merge gates (currently `Validate`), the corresponding IaC config must be updated or PRs will be permanently blocked. Always flag this when proposing workflow changes.

## Releasing

Releases follow a **two-phase, PR-based flow** driven by a machine-global, repo-agnostic helper (`rust-release.sh`, aliased to `release` — not tracked in-repo). Agents must respect the Git Policy above: perform the **prepare** file edits, but never commit, tag, or push.

- **Phase 1 — prepare (in a feature branch / release PR).** `release prepare <major|minor|patch>` bumps `[workspace.package] version` and every internal `toku-*` path-dep version in `[workspace.dependencies]`, refreshes `Cargo.lock`, and stamps `CHANGELOG.md` (`[Unreleased] → [x.y.z] - <date>`, plus compare links). It does **not** commit, tag, or push — the resulting diff *is* the release PR. An agent may reproduce these edits by hand (equivalent to the script) and leave them uncommitted for review. The phase is idempotent: re-running when already prepared is a no-op.
- **Phase 2 — tag (on the default branch, after the PR merges).** `release tag [--push]` verifies the version is already stamped, then creates the annotated `vX.Y.Z` tag at the merge commit and (with `--push`) pushes it. **Pushing the tag is the only trigger** for `.github/workflows/release.yml` (multi-target binary build + crates.io publish). This is a human/maintainer step — agents never tag or push.

Conventions:

- During normal work, only accumulate user-facing entries under `## [Unreleased]`; the version bump + changelog stamp happen solely at release time (Phase 1), never per-PR.
- Because the crates are published to crates.io, `[workspace.dependencies]` path deps carry an explicit `version = "x.y.z"` (required to publish a path dep). These **must stay in lockstep** with `[workspace.package] version` — the helper keeps them synced on every `prepare`. Do not hand-edit one without the other; a lone drift stays invisible within a patch range (`^0.3.0` matches `0.3.x`) and only breaks at the next minor/major bump.
- Before cutting, confirm the git tag matches `Cargo.toml` and that no CI job names changed (see CI / Infrastructure Dependency).
